Abstract: This paper introduces a novel benchmark, EGE-Math Solutions Assessment
Benchmark, for evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on their ability to
assess hand-written mathematical solutions. Unlike existing benchmarks that
focus on problem solving, our approach centres on understanding student
solutions, identifying mistakes, and assigning grades according to fixed
criteria. We compile 122 scanned solutions from the Russian Unified State Exam
(EGE) together with official expert grades, and evaluate seven modern VLMs from
Google, OpenAI, Arcee AI, and Alibaba Cloud in three inference modes. The
results reveal current limitations in mathematical reasoning and human-rubric
alignment, opening new research avenues in AI-assisted assessment. You can find

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多视角捕获中外观变化对重建和渲染的负面影响，同时提升城市场景重建的效率与质量。

Method: 采用场景分区并行训练、基于可见性的图像选择、可控细节策略和外观变换模块，结合深度、尺度和抗锯齿增强模块。

Result: 实验表明，该方法高效重建城市场景，在效率和质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在城市场景重建中表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: We present a framework that enables fast reconstruction and real-time
rendering of urban-scale scenes while maintaining robustness against appearance
variations across multi-view captures. Our approach begins with scene
partitioning for parallel training, employing a visibility-based image
selection strategy to optimize training efficiency. A controllable
level-of-detail (LOD) strategy explicitly regulates Gaussian density under a
user-defined budget, enabling efficient training and rendering while
maintaining high visual fidelity. The appearance transformation module
mitigates the negative effects of appearance inconsistencies across images
while enabling flexible adjustments. Additionally, we utilize enhancement
modules, such as depth regularization, scale regularization, and antialiasing,
to improve reconstruction fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method effectively reconstructs urban-scale scenes and outperforms previous
approaches in both efficiency and quality. The source code is available at:

### [3] [Modeling Human Gaze Behavior with Diffusion Models for Unified Scanpath Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23021)
*Giuseppe Cartella,Vittorio Cuculo,Alessandro D'Amelio,Marcella Cornia,Giuseppe Boccignone,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScanDiff结合扩散模型和Vision Transformers，生成多样且真实的注视扫描路径，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法生成平均行为，无法捕捉人类视觉探索的变异性。

Method: 结合扩散模型和Vision Transformers，利用文本条件实现任务驱动的扫描路径生成。

Result: 在基准数据集上，ScanDiff在自由观看和任务驱动场景中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ScanDiff能更好地捕捉人类视觉行为的复杂性，推动注视预测研究。

Abstract: Predicting human gaze scanpaths is crucial for understanding visual
attention, with applications in human-computer interaction, autonomous systems,
and cognitive robotics. While deep learning models have advanced scanpath
prediction, most existing approaches generate averaged behaviors, failing to
capture the variability of human visual exploration. In this work, we present
ScanDiff, a novel architecture that combines diffusion models with Vision
Transformers to generate diverse and realistic scanpaths. Our method explicitly
models scanpath variability by leveraging the stochastic nature of diffusion
models, producing a wide range of plausible gaze trajectories. Additionally, we
introduce textual conditioning to enable task-driven scanpath generation,
allowing the model to adapt to different visual search objectives. Experiments
on benchmark datasets show that ScanDiff surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
both free-viewing and task-driven scenarios, producing more diverse and
accurate scanpaths. These results highlight its ability to better capture the
complexity of human visual behavior, pushing forward gaze prediction research.

### [4] [Recovering Diagnostic Value: Super-Resolution-Aided Echocardiographic Classification in Resource-Constrained Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23027)
*Krishan Agyakari Raja Babu,Om Prabhu,Annu,Mohanasankar Sivaprakasam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了深度学习超分辨率技术在低质量超声心动图中的应用，显著提升了分类任务的表现，尤其适用于资源受限环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 资源受限环境下超声心动图质量差，限制了诊断模型的效能，超分辨率技术可能改善这一问题。

Method: 使用SRGAN和SRResNet两种超分辨率模型处理低质量图像，并在CAMUS数据集上评估2CH vs. 4CH和ED vs. ES分类任务。

Result: SRResNet在提升分类准确率方面表现显著，且计算效率高。

Conclusion: 超分辨率技术能有效恢复低质量超声心动图的诊断价值，适用于资源受限环境中的AI辅助医疗。

Abstract: Automated cardiac interpretation in resource-constrained settings (RCS) is
often hindered by poor-quality echocardiographic imaging, limiting the
effectiveness of downstream diagnostic models. While super-resolution (SR)
techniques have shown promise in enhancing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
computed tomography (CT) scans, their application to echocardiography-a widely
accessible but noise-prone modality-remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate the potential of deep learning-based SR to improve classification
accuracy on low-quality 2D echocardiograms. Using the publicly available CAMUS
dataset, we stratify samples by image quality and evaluate two clinically
relevant tasks of varying complexity: a relatively simple Two-Chamber vs.
Four-Chamber (2CH vs. 4CH) view classification and a more complex End-Diastole
vs. End-Systole (ED vs. ES) phase classification. We apply two widely used SR
models-Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) and
Super-Resolution Residual Network (SRResNet), to enhance poor-quality images
and observe significant gains in performance metric-particularly with SRResNet,
which also offers computational efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that SR
can effectively recover diagnostic value in degraded echo scans, making it a
viable tool for AI-assisted care in RCS, achieving more with less.

### [5] [Adaptive Time-step Training for Enhancing Spike-Based Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23033)
*Ranxi Lin,Canming Yao,Jiayi Li,Weihang Liu,Xin Lou,Pingqiang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于脉冲神经网络的NeRF框架（PATA），通过动态时间步长策略在训练和推理中平衡渲染质量与计算资源消耗，显著降低了推理时间和能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NeRF模型依赖密集点采样，计算资源消耗大，限制了其在资源受限场景（如边缘计算）中的应用。脉冲神经网络（SNNs）因其高效能耗特性成为潜在解决方案。

Method: 提出PATA框架，结合动态时间步长训练策略，自动探索渲染质量与时间步长的权衡，并基于Instant-NGP架构进行实现。

Result: 实验表明，PATA在保持渲染质量的同时，减少了64%的推理时间步长和61.55%的运行功耗。

Conclusion: PATA为资源受限场景下的高效神经渲染提供了可行方案，显著降低了计算资源需求。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based models have achieved remarkable success
in 3D reconstruction and rendering tasks. However, during both training and
inference, these models rely heavily on dense point sampling along rays from
multiple viewpoints, resulting in a surge in floating-point operations and
severely limiting their use in resource-constrained scenarios like edge
computing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which communicate via binary spikes
over discrete time steps, offer a promising alternative due to their
energy-efficient nature. Given the inherent variability in scene scale and
texture complexity in neural rendering and the prevailing practice of training
separate models per scene, we propose a spike-based NeRF framework with a
dynamic time step training strategy, termed Pretrain-Adaptive Time-step
Adjustment (PATA). This approach automatically explores the trade-off between
rendering quality and time step length during training. Consequently, it
enables scene-adaptive inference with variable time steps and reduces the
additional consumption of computational resources in the inference process.
Anchoring to the established Instant-NGP architecture, we evaluate our method
across diverse datasets. The experimental results show that PATA can preserve
rendering fidelity while reducing inference time steps by 64\% and running
power by 61.55\%.

### [6] [Early Goal-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion for Real-Time Vision-Language Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23042)
*Santosh Patapati,Trisanth Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NovaDrive是一种单分支视觉语言架构，通过处理多模态输入（图像、地图、LiDAR和文本路径点）实现高效自动驾驶，提升成功率和路径效率，减少碰撞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶需在毫秒内响应复杂路况，传统方法依赖循环记忆，效率低。NovaDrive旨在通过单分支架构和多模态融合解决这一问题。

Method: 采用单分支架构处理多模态输入，引入两阶段交叉注意力块对齐路径点与地图，并优化图像和深度补丁的注意力。结合平滑损失函数避免突变控制。

Result: 在nuScenes/Waymo基准测试中，成功率提升4%（达84%），路径效率（SPL）提高0.11（达0.66），碰撞频率降低1.4%（至1.2%）。

Conclusion: NovaDrive通过多模态融合和优化设计显著提升自动驾驶性能，且具有节能潜力，可扩展至其他具身AI领域。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road
geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations. We introduce
NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes
front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a
single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns
waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image
and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt
steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent
memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language
backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the
MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts
path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from
2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations
confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention
fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's
shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower
fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving
stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.

### [7] [Reference-Guided Diffusion Inpainting For Multimodal Counterfactual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23058)
*Alexandru Buburuzan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种新的合成数据生成方法MObI和AnydoorMed，分别用于自动驾驶和医学图像分析，通过扩散模型实现高真实感和可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于真实数据收集成本高且复杂，合成数据方法在安全关键应用中变得重要，但需要高真实感和可控性。

Method: MObI利用扩散模型进行多模态对象修复，支持相机和激光雷达；AnydoorMed专注于医学图像中的参考引导修复。

Result: 两种方法均能生成高真实感、可控的合成数据，保持语义一致性和多模态连贯性。

Conclusion: 这些方法表明，参考引导修复的基础模型可适应多种感知模态，推动构建高度真实和可控的多模态反事实场景。

Abstract: Safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and medical image
analysis, require extensive multimodal data for rigorous testing. Synthetic
data methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering
real-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability
to be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data
generation in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and
AnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal
Object Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and
controllable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated
simultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI
enables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a
specified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic
consistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods
that rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning
to ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed
extends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on
reference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a
diffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation,
maintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically
blending it with the surrounding tissue. Together, these methods demonstrate
that foundation models for reference-guided inpainting in natural images can be
readily adapted to diverse perceptual modalities, paving the way for the next
generation of systems capable of constructing highly realistic, controllable
and multimodal counterfactual scenarios.

### [8] [Vision-Language Fusion for Real-Time Autonomous Driving: Goal-Centered Cross-Attention of Camera, HD-Map, & Waypoints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23064)
*Santosh Patapati,Trisanth Srinivasan,Murari Ambati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XYZ-Drive是一个结合视觉和语言的单一模型，通过融合前摄像头、地图和路径点信息，实现自动驾驶的高效导航和解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶需要同时处理几何精度和语义理解，但现有方法通常分开处理。XYZ-Drive旨在通过单一模型整合多模态信息，提升导航性能和透明度。

Method: 使用轻量级目标中心交叉注意力层，将路径点信息与图像和地图补丁融合，再输入部分微调的LLaMA-3.2 11B模型。

Result: 在MD-NEX基准测试中，XYZ-Drive达到95%成功率和0.80 SPL，超越PhysNav-DG 15%，碰撞率减半，且效率显著提升。

Conclusion: 早期、令牌级别的意图和地图布局融合能实现准确、透明且实时的自动驾驶。

Abstract: Autonomous cars need geometric accuracy and semantic understanding to
navigate complex environments, yet most stacks handle them separately. We
present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera
frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs
steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets
waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both
action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially
fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model.
  On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and
0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and
halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only
a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality
(vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their
complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention
with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion
injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses
5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks
such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs
lane edges and raises crash rate.
  Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent
and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.

### [9] [Vocabulary-free Fine-grained Visual Recognition via Enriched Contextually Grounded Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23070)
*Dmitry Demidov,Zaigham Zaheer,Omkar Thawakar,Salman Khan,Fahad Shahbaz Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需训练的方法E-FineR，结合大型语言模型和视觉语言模型，实现了细粒度图像分类的开放集识别，性能优越且具有高可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统细粒度图像分类方法依赖固定词汇和封闭集分类，难以适应现实世界中新类别的出现。现有方法未能充分利用LLM的分类能力，且依赖未经充分分析的类别名称猜测。

Method: 提出E-FineR方法，无需训练，结合LLM和VLM，通过语言驱动的理解实现细粒度分类，支持零样本和少样本分类。

Result: E-FineR在细粒度视觉识别中达到SOTA性能，并在零样本和少样本分类中表现优异，无需人工干预。

Conclusion: E-FineR推动了图像分类从固定标签预测向灵活语言驱动理解的转变，适用于现实应用和缺乏专家标注的新领域。

Abstract: Fine-grained image classification, the task of distinguishing between
visually similar subcategories within a broader category (e.g., bird species,
car models, flower types), is a challenging computer vision problem.
Traditional approaches rely heavily on fixed vocabularies and closed-set
classification paradigms, limiting their scalability and adaptability in
real-world settings where novel classes frequently emerge. Recent research has
demonstrated that combining large language models (LLMs) with vision-language
models (VLMs) makes open-set recognition possible without the need for
predefined class labels. However, the existing methods are often limited in
harnessing the power of LLMs at the classification phase, and also rely heavily
on the guessed class names provided by an LLM without thorough analysis and
refinement. To address these bottlenecks, we propose our training-free method,
Enriched-FineR (or E-FineR for short), which demonstrates state-of-the-art
results in fine-grained visual recognition while also offering greater
interpretability, highlighting its strong potential in real-world scenarios and
new domains where expert annotations are difficult to obtain. Additionally, we
demonstrate the application of our proposed approach to zero-shot and few-shot
classification, where it demonstrated performance on par with the existing SOTA
while being training-free and not requiring human interventions. Overall, our
vocabulary-free framework supports the shift in image classification from rigid
label prediction to flexible, language-driven understanding, enabling scalable
and generalizable systems for real-world applications. Well-documented code is
available on https://github.com/demidovd98/e-finer.

### [10] [Details Matter for Indoor Open-vocabulary 3D Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23134)
*Sanghun Jung,Jingjing Zheng,Ke Zhang,Nan Qiao,Albert Y. C. Chen,Lu Xia,Chi Liu,Yuyin Sun,Xiao Zeng,Hsiang-Wei Huang,Byron Boots,Min Sun,Cheng-Hao Kuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的开放词汇3D实例分割方法，通过结合和优化现有概念，采用两阶段方案（3D提案生成和实例分类），并引入Alpha-CLIP和标准化最大相似度（SMS）评分，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放词汇3D实例分割（OV-3DIS）通常依赖视觉语言模型（VLMs），但现有方法的概念互补性未被充分利用。本文旨在通过整合和优化这些概念，解决关键挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段方案：1）使用基于3D跟踪的提案聚合生成3D提案，并通过迭代合并/移除处理重叠或部分提案；2）用Alpha-CLIP替代标准CLIP模型，减少背景噪声，并引入SMS评分标准化相似度。

Result: 在ScanNet200和S3DIS数据集上，所有AP和AR指标均达到最优性能，甚至超过端到端的封闭词汇方法。

Conclusion: 通过结合互补概念并引入创新技术（如Alpha-CLIP和SMS评分），本文提出的框架显著提升了OV-3DIS的性能，成为新的SOTA方法。

Abstract: Unlike closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation that is often trained
end-to-end, open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) often leverages
vision-language models (VLMs) to generate 3D instance proposals and classify
them. While various concepts have been proposed from existing research, we
observe that these individual concepts are not mutually exclusive but
complementary. In this paper, we propose a new state-of-the-art solution for
OV-3DIS by carefully designing a recipe to combine the concepts together and
refining them to address key challenges. Our solution follows the two-stage
scheme: 3D proposal generation and instance classification. We employ robust 3D
tracking-based proposal aggregation to generate 3D proposals and remove
overlapped or partial proposals by iterative merging/removal. For the
classification stage, we replace the standard CLIP model with Alpha-CLIP, which
incorporates object masks as an alpha channel to reduce background noise and
obtain object-centric representation. Additionally, we introduce the
standardized maximum similarity (SMS) score to normalize text-to-proposal
similarity, effectively filtering out false positives and boosting precision.
Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 and S3DIS
across all AP and AR metrics, even surpassing an end-to-end closed-vocabulary
method.

### [11] [X-NeMo: Expressive Neural Motion Reenactment via Disentangled Latent Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23143)
*Xiaochen Zhao,Hongyi Xu,Guoxian Song,You Xie,Chenxu Zhang,Xiu Li,Linjie Luo,Jinli Suo,Yebin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-NeMo是一个基于扩散模型的零样本肖像动画方法，通过驱动视频中的面部动作生成静态肖像动画，解决了身份泄漏和表情捕捉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在身份泄漏和难以捕捉细微及极端表情的问题，X-NeMo旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: 提出端到端训练框架，提取1D身份无关运动描述符，通过交叉注意力控制图像生成，并使用双GAN解码器和数据增强增强表达能力。

Result: 实验表明X-NeMo优于现有方法，生成高表现力动画且身份相似度高。

Conclusion: X-NeMo通过创新的运动描述符和训练框架，显著提升了肖像动画的质量和身份保持能力。

Abstract: We propose X-NeMo, a novel zero-shot diffusion-based portrait animation
pipeline that animates a static portrait using facial movements from a driving
video of a different individual. Our work first identifies the root causes of
the key issues in prior approaches, such as identity leakage and difficulty in
capturing subtle and extreme expressions. To address these challenges, we
introduce a fully end-to-end training framework that distills a 1D
identity-agnostic latent motion descriptor from driving image, effectively
controlling motion through cross-attention during image generation. Our
implicit motion descriptor captures expressive facial motion in fine detail,
learned end-to-end from a diverse video dataset without reliance on pretrained
motion detectors. We further enhance expressiveness and disentangle motion
latents from identity cues by supervising their learning with a dual GAN
decoder, alongside spatial and color augmentations. By embedding the driving
motion into a 1D latent vector and controlling motion via cross-attention
rather than additive spatial guidance, our design eliminates the transmission
of spatial-aligned structural clues from the driving condition to the diffusion
backbone, substantially mitigating identity leakage. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that X-NeMo surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, producing highly
expressive animations with superior identity resemblance. Our code and models
are available for research.

### [12] [Neural Multi-View Self-Calibrated Photometric Stereo without Photometric Stereo Cues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23162)
*Xu Cao,Takafumi Taketomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种神经逆向渲染方法，从多视角图像中联合重建几何、空间变化反射率和光照条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法需要光照校准或中间线索（如每视角法线图）的问题，直接从原始图像中联合优化所有场景参数。

Method: 使用神经隐式场表示几何和反射率，结合阴影感知体积渲染；通过空间网络预测有符号距离和反射率潜在码，反射率网络估计反射率值。

Result: 在形状和光照估计精度上优于现有方法，适用于视角未对齐的多光源图像，并能处理复杂几何和反射率物体。

Conclusion: 该方法在无需中间线索的情况下，实现了高效的场景参数联合优化，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We propose a neural inverse rendering approach that jointly reconstructs
geometry, spatially varying reflectance, and lighting conditions from
multi-view images captured under varying directional lighting. Unlike prior
multi-view photometric stereo methods that require light calibration or
intermediate cues such as per-view normal maps, our method jointly optimizes
all scene parameters from raw images in a single stage. We represent both
geometry and reflectance as neural implicit fields and apply shadow-aware
volume rendering. A spatial network first predicts the signed distance and a
reflectance latent code for each scene point. A reflectance network then
estimates reflectance values conditioned on the latent code and angularly
encoded surface normal, view, and light directions. The proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art normal-guided approaches in shape and lighting
estimation accuracy, generalizes to view-unaligned multi-light images, and
handles objects with challenging geometry and reflectance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的图像去雨网络，通过引入角损失和残差卷积块注意力模块（R-CBAM）来提升去雨效果，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单图像去雨问题不仅需要抑制噪声，还需保留细节和视觉质量，现有方法在边界和纹理保留上表现不足。

Method: 引入角损失防止边界和纹理信息丢失，并在编码器和解码器中加入R-CBAM模块动态调整特征重要性。

Result: 在Rain100L和Rain100H数据集上分别达到33.29 dB和26.16 dB的PSNR，显著优于之前的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过角损失和R-CBAM模块有效提升了去雨效果，尤其在细节保留和视觉质量上表现突出。

Abstract: The problem of single-image rain streak removal goes beyond simple noise
suppression, requiring the simultaneous preservation of fine structural details
and overall visual quality. In this study, we propose a novel image restoration
network that effectively constrains the restoration process by introducing a
Corner Loss, which prevents the loss of object boundaries and detailed texture
information during restoration. Furthermore, we propose a Residual
Convolutional Block Attention Module (R-CBAM) Block into the encoder and
decoder to dynamically adjust the importance of features in both spatial and
channel dimensions, enabling the network to focus more effectively on regions
heavily affected by rain streaks. Quantitative evaluations conducted on the
Rain100L and Rain100H datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
significantly outperforms previous approaches, achieving a PSNR of 33.29 dB on
Rain100L and 26.16 dB on Rain100H.

Abstract: Motion retrieval is crucial for motion acquisition, offering superior
precision, realism, controllability, and editability compared to motion
generation. Existing approaches leverage contrastive learning to construct a
unified embedding space for motion retrieval from text or visual modality.
However, these methods lack a more intuitive and user-friendly interaction mode
and often overlook the sequential representation of most modalities for
improved retrieval performance. To address these limitations, we propose a
framework that aligns four modalities -- text, audio, video, and motion --
within a fine-grained joint embedding space, incorporating audio for the first
time in motion retrieval to enhance user immersion and convenience. This
fine-grained space is achieved through a sequence-level contrastive learning
approach, which captures critical details across modalities for better
alignment. To evaluate our framework, we augment existing text-motion datasets
with synthetic but diverse audio recordings, creating two multi-modal motion
retrieval datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods across multiple sub-tasks, including an 10.16%
improvement in R@10 for text-to-motion retrieval and a 25.43% improvement in
R@1 for video-to-motion retrieval on the HumanML3D dataset. Furthermore, our
results show that our 4-modal framework significantly outperforms its 3-modal
counterpart, underscoring the potential of multi-modal motion retrieval for
advancing motion acquisition.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel dataset for segmenting flooded areas in
satellite images. After reviewing 77 existing benchmarks utilizing satellite
imagery, we identified a shortage of suitable datasets for this specific task.
To fill this gap, we collected satellite imagery of the 2019 Midwestern USA
floods from Planet Explorer by Planet Labs (Image \c{opyright} 2024 Planet Labs
PBC). The dataset consists of 10 satellite images per location, each containing
both flooded and non-flooded areas. We selected ten locations from each of the
five states: Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, and South Dakota. The dataset
ensures uniform resolution and resizing during data processing. For evaluating
semantic segmentation performance, we tested state-of-the-art models in
computer vision and remote sensing on our dataset. Additionally, we conducted
an ablation study varying window sizes to capture temporal characteristics.
Overall, the models demonstrated modest results, suggesting a requirement for
future multimodal and temporal learning strategies. The dataset will be
publicly available on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于扩散模型的对抗攻击方法（AGD），用于欺骗多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）生成目标响应，同时避免对原始图像的显著扭曲。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗攻击通常在高频段嵌入扰动，容易被防御方法（如低通滤波）抑制。AGD旨在通过将对抗信号嵌入扩散模型的噪声中，提高攻击的鲁棒性。

Method: AGD在反向扩散过程中引入对抗引导噪声，将目标语义注入噪声成分，利用噪声的全频谱特性避免被防御方法抑制。

Result: 实验表明，AGD在攻击性能和对抗防御的鲁棒性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AGD通过噪声嵌入对抗信号，有效提升了对抗攻击的隐蔽性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of generating adversarial image using a
diffusion model to deceive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into
generating the targeted responses, while avoiding significant distortion of the
clean image. To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided
diffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce
adversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our
design is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed
high-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target
semantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added
noise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial
signal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property.
Importantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a
linear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying
defenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each
component, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to
be suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band. This makes AGD
inherently robust to variety defenses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our AGD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attack performance as well as
in model robustness to some defenses.

Result: 提高了团聚分类的准确性和尺寸分布预测，成功分类潜在团聚实例。

Conclusion: 方法有效解决了手动标注困难的问题，提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Food crystal agglomeration is a phenomenon occurs during crystallization
which traps water between crystals and affects food product quality. Manual
annotation of agglomeration in 2D microscopic images is particularly difficult
due to the transparency of water bonding and the limited perspective focusing
on a single slide of the imaged sample. To address this challenge, we first
propose a supervised baseline model to generate segmentation pseudo-labels for
the coarsely labeled classification dataset. Next, an instance classification
model that simultaneously performs pixel-wise segmentation is trained. Both
models are used in the inference stage to combine their respective strengths in
classification and segmentation. To preserve crystal properties, a post
processing module is designed and included to both steps. Our method improves
true positive agglomeration classification accuracy and size distribution
predictions compared to other existing methods. Given the variability in
confidence levels of manual annotations, our proposed method is evaluated under
two confidence levels and successfully classifies potential agglomerated
instances.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在道路损伤检测中存在多尺度特征提取能力不足和计算复杂度高的问题，限制了实时检测的部署。

Method: 设计了双向多尺度空间金字塔池化模块（BMS-SPPF）增强多尺度特征提取，并采用分层通道压缩策略降低计算复杂度。

Result: 在RDD2022_China_Drone数据集上，YOLO-ROC的mAP50达到67.6%，比基线YOLOv8n提升2.11%，小目标D40类别的mAP50提升16.8%，模型大小仅2.0MB。

Conclusion: YOLO-ROC在保持高精度的同时显著降低了计算复杂度，适用于实时道路损伤检测。

Abstract: Road damage detection is a critical task for ensuring traffic safety and
maintaining infrastructure integrity. While deep learning-based detection
methods are now widely adopted, they still face two core challenges: first, the
inadequate multi-scale feature extraction capabilities of existing networks for
diverse targets like cracks and potholes, leading to high miss rates for
small-scale damage; and second, the substantial parameter counts and
computational demands of mainstream models, which hinder their deployment for
efficient, real-time detection in practical applications. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a high-precision and lightweight model, YOLO - Road
Orthogonal Compact (YOLO-ROC). We designed a Bidirectional Multi-scale Spatial
Pyramid Pooling Fast (BMS-SPPF) module to enhance multi-scale feature
extraction and implemented a hierarchical channel compression strategy to
reduce computational complexity. The BMS-SPPF module leverages a bidirectional
spatial-channel attention mechanism to improve the detection of small targets.
Concurrently, the channel compression strategy reduces the parameter count from
3.01M to 0.89M and GFLOPs from 8.1 to 2.6. Experiments on the
RDD2022_China_Drone dataset demonstrate that YOLO-ROC achieves a mAP50 of
67.6%, surpassing the baseline YOLOv8n by 2.11%. Notably, the mAP50 for the
small-target D40 category improved by 16.8%, and the final model size is only
2.0 MB. Furthermore, the model exhibits excellent generalization performance on
the RDD2022_China_Motorbike dataset.

Abstract: As augmented reality (AR) becomes increasingly integrated into everyday life,
ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of its virtual content is critical. Our
research addresses the risks of task-detrimental AR content, particularly that
which obstructs critical information or subtly manipulates user perception. We
developed two systems, ViDDAR and VIM-Sense, to detect such attacks using
vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal reasoning modules. Building on
this foundation, we propose three future directions: automated, perceptually
aligned quality assessment of virtual content; detection of multimodal attacks;
and adaptation of VLMs for efficient and user-centered deployment on AR
devices. Overall, our work aims to establish a scalable, human-aligned
framework for safeguarding AR experiences and seeks feedback on perceptual
modeling, multimodal AR content implementation, and lightweight model
adaptation.

Method: 提出广义半监督少样本类增量学习（GSemi-FSCIL）框架，并设计ALDC策略，动态利用基类样本校准新类特征分布。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上实验，ALDC策略表现优于现有方法，达到新的最优性能。

Conclusion: 广义化未标记数据来源和ALDC策略有效提升了少样本类增量学习在实际场景中的性能。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) focuses on models learning new
concepts from limited data while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
Recently, many studies have started to leverage unlabeled samples to assist
models in learning from few-shot samples, giving rise to the field of
Semi-supervised Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (Semi-FSCIL). However,
these studies often assume that the source of unlabeled data is only confined
to novel classes of the current session, which presents a narrow perspective
and cannot align well with practical scenarios. To better reflect real-world
scenarios, we redefine Semi-FSCIL as Generalized Semi-FSCIL (GSemi-FSCIL) by
incorporating both base and all the ever-seen novel classes in the unlabeled
set. This change in the composition of unlabeled samples poses a new challenge
for existing methods, as they struggle to distinguish between unlabeled samples
from base and novel classes. To address this issue, we propose an
Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) strategy. ALDC
dynamically uses abundant base samples to correct biased feature distributions
for few-shot novel classes. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that
our method outperforms existing works, setting new state-of-the-art results.

Method: 通过合成场景-问题对，利用广义奖励策略优化（GRPO）训练特定于检索器的查询重写器。

Conclusion: RL-QR为RAG系统提供了一种可扩展、无需标注的查询优化方案，但在语义检索方面仍需改进。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on effective query
formulation to unlock external knowledge, yet optimizing queries for diverse,
unstructured real-world documents remains a challenge. We introduce
\textbf{RL-QR}, a reinforcement learning framework for retriever-specific query
rewriting that eliminates the need for human-annotated datasets and extends
applicability to both text-only and multi-modal databases. By synthesizing
scenario-question pairs and leveraging Generalized Reward Policy Optimization
(GRPO), RL-QR trains query rewriters tailored to specific retrievers, enhancing
retrieval performance across varied domains. Experiments on industrial in-house
data demonstrate significant improvements, with
$\text{RL-QR}_{\text{multi-modal}}$ achieving an 11\% relative gain in NDCG@3
for multi-modal RAG and $\text{RL-QR}_{\text{lexical}}$ yielding a 9\% gain for
lexical retrievers. However, challenges persist with semantic and hybrid
retrievers, where rewriters failed to improve performance, likely due to
training misalignments. Our findings highlight RL-QR's potential to
revolutionize query optimization for RAG systems, offering a scalable,
annotation-free solution for real-world retrieval tasks, while identifying
avenues for further refinement in semantic retrieval contexts.

Abstract: Cranial nerves (CNs) play a crucial role in various essential functions of
the human brain, and mapping their pathways from diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides
valuable preoperative insights into the spatial relationships between
individual CNs and key tissues. However, mapping a comprehensive and detailed
CN atlas is challenging because of the unique anatomical structures of each CN
pair and the complexity of the skull base environment.In this work, we present
what we believe to be the first study to develop a comprehensive diffusion
tractography atlas for automated mapping of CN pathways in the human brain. The
CN atlas is generated by fiber clustering by using the streamlines generated by
multi-parametric fiber tractography for each pair of CNs. Instead of disposable
clustering, we explore a new strategy of multi-stage fiber clustering for
multiple analysis of approximately 1,000,000 streamlines generated from the 50
subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Quantitative and visual
experiments demonstrate that our CN atlas achieves high spatial correspondence
with expert manual annotations on multiple acquisition sites, including the HCP
dataset, the Multi-shell Diffusion MRI (MDM) dataset and two clinical cases of
pituitary adenoma patients. The proposed CN atlas can automatically identify 8
fiber bundles associated with 5 pairs of CNs, including the optic nerve CN II,
oculomotor nerve CN III, trigeminal nerve CN V and facial-vestibulocochlear
nerve CN VII/VIII, and its robustness is demonstrated experimentally. This work
contributes to the field of diffusion imaging by facilitating more efficient
and automated mapping the pathways of multiple pairs of CNs, thereby enhancing
the analysis and understanding of complex brain structures through
visualization of their spatial relationships with nearby anatomy.

Abstract: Generic object tracking remains an important yet challenging task in computer
vision due to complex spatio-temporal dynamics, especially in the presence of
occlusions, similar distractors, and appearance variations. Over the past two
decades, a wide range of tracking paradigms, including Siamese-based trackers,
discriminative trackers, and, more recently, prominent transformer-based
approaches, have been introduced to address these challenges. While a few
existing survey papers in this field have either concentrated on a single
category or widely covered multiple ones to capture progress, our paper
presents a comprehensive review of all three categories, with particular
emphasis on the rapidly evolving transformer-based methods. We analyze the core
design principles, innovations, and limitations of each approach through both
qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Our study introduces a novel
categorization and offers a unified visual and tabular comparison of
representative methods. Additionally, we organize existing trackers from
multiple perspectives and summarize the major evaluation benchmarks,
highlighting the fast-paced advancements in transformer-based tracking driven
by their robust spatio-temporal modeling capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的时间序列评估指标TGSI和训练损失函数SATL，以更好地捕捉时间序列的几何结构，提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值指标（如MSE）无法评估时间序列的几何结构，而几何结构对理解时间动态至关重要。

Method: 提出TGSI将时间序列转化为图像以评估几何结构；引入SATL作为多组件损失函数，结合一阶差分损失、频域损失和感知特征损失。

Result: 实验表明，使用SATL训练的模型在MSE和TGSI指标上均优于基线方法，且推理时无额外计算成本。

Conclusion: SATL和TGSI有效提升了时间序列预测的几何结构建模能力，为时间序列分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: Time Series forecasting is critical in diverse domains such as weather
forecasting, financial investment, and traffic management. While traditional
numerical metrics like mean squared error (MSE) can quantify point-wise
accuracy, they fail to evaluate the geometric structure of time series data,
which is essential to understand temporal dynamics. To address this issue, we
propose the time series Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), a novel evaluation
metric that transforms time series into images to leverage their inherent
two-dimensional geometric representations. However, since the image
transformation process is non-differentiable, TGSI cannot be directly
integrated as a training loss. We further introduce the Shape-Aware Temporal
Loss (SATL), a multi-component loss function operating in the time series
modality to bridge this gap and enhance structure modeling during training.
SATL combines three components: a first-order difference loss that measures
structural consistency through the MSE between first-order differences, a
frequency domain loss that captures essential periodic patterns using the Fast
Fourier Transform while minimizing noise, and a perceptual feature loss that
measures geometric structure difference in time-series by aligning temporal
features with geometric structure features through a pre-trained temporal
feature extractor and time-series image autoencoder. Experiments across
multiple datasets demonstrate that models trained with SATL achieve superior
performance in both MSE and the proposed TGSI metrics compared to baseline
methods, without additional computational cost during inference.

Motivation: 传统方法在部分标签多标签图像识别中依赖预设阈值生成伪标签，忽略了不同类别的分数分布差异，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出SATL算法，动态计算每个类别的正负样本分数分布并学习类别特定阈值，同时引入差异排名损失以增强阈值区分度。

Result: 在Microsoft COCO和VG-200等大规模数据集上的实验表明，该方法在标签有限的情况下显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: SATL算法通过动态阈值学习和差异排名损失，有效解决了部分标签多标签图像识别中的伪标签不准确问题。

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with partial labels (MLR-PL) is designed to
train models using a mix of known and unknown labels. Traditional methods rely
on semantic or feature correlations to create pseudo-labels for unidentified
labels using pre-set thresholds. This approach often overlooks the varying
score distributions across categories, resulting in inaccurate and incomplete
pseudo-labels, thereby affecting performance. In our study, we introduce the
Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL) algorithm. This innovative approach
calculates the score distribution for both positive and negative samples within
each category and determines category-specific thresholds based on these
distributions. These distributions and thresholds are dynamically updated
throughout the learning process. Additionally, we implement a differential
ranking loss to establish a significant gap between the score distributions of
positive and negative samples, enhancing the discrimination of the thresholds.
Comprehensive experiments and analysis on large-scale multi-label datasets,
such as Microsoft COCO and VG-200, demonstrate that our method significantly
improves performance in scenarios with limited labels.

Motivation: 传统扩散变换器的成功依赖于预训练变分自编码器（VAE）的压缩潜在空间，但两阶段训练会引入累积误差和解码伪影。

Method: 提出PixelNerd框架，利用神经场高效表示补丁解码，实现单尺度和单阶段的端到端训练。

Conclusion: PixelNerd是一种高效且性能优越的替代方案，避免了传统方法的复杂性和误差累积。

Abstract: The current success of diffusion transformers heavily depends on the
compressed latent space shaped by the pre-trained variational autoencoder(VAE).
However, this two-stage training paradigm inevitably introduces accumulated
errors and decoding artifacts. To address the aforementioned problems,
researchers return to pixel space at the cost of complicated cascade pipelines
and increased token complexity. In contrast to their efforts, we propose to
model the patch-wise decoding with neural field and present a single-scale,
single-stage, efficient, end-to-end solution, coined as pixel neural field
diffusion~(PixelNerd). Thanks to the efficient neural field representation in
PixNerd, we directly achieved 2.15 FID on ImageNet $256\times256$ and 2.84 FID
on ImageNet $512\times512$ without any complex cascade pipeline or VAE. We also
extend our PixNerd framework to text-to-image applications. Our PixNerd-XXL/16
achieved a competitive 0.73 overall score on the GenEval benchmark and 80.9
overall score on the DPG benchmark.

Motivation: 解决乳腺MRI手动分析的高成本和主观性问题，探索低成本AI工具在资源有限地区的应用。

Method: 利用SAM2模型，通过单一切片的边界框标注，采用三种切片追踪策略（从上到下、从下到上、中心向外）进行3D分割。

Result: 中心向外传播策略效果最佳，SAM2在零样本情况下表现优异，但受肿瘤大小、位置和形状影响。

Conclusion: 通用基础模型如SAM2可在低监督下支持3D医学图像分析，为资源有限地区提供可行方案。

Abstract: Breast MRI provides high-resolution volumetric imaging critical for tumor
assessment and treatment planning, yet manual interpretation of 3D scans
remains labor-intensive and subjective. While AI-powered tools hold promise for
accelerating medical image analysis, adoption of commercial medical AI products
remains limited in low- and middle-income countries due to high license costs,
proprietary software, and infrastructure demands. In this work, we investigate
whether the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can be adapted for low-cost,
minimal-input 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI. Using a single bounding box
annotation on one slice, we propagate segmentation predictions across the 3D
volume using three different slice-wise tracking strategies: top-to-bottom,
bottom-to-top, and center-outward. We evaluate these strategies across a large
cohort of patients and find that center-outward propagation yields the most
consistent and accurate segmentations. Despite being a zero-shot model not
trained for volumetric medical data, SAM2 achieves strong segmentation
performance under minimal supervision. We further analyze how segmentation
performance relates to tumor size, location, and shape, identifying key failure
modes. Our results suggest that general-purpose foundation models such as SAM2
can support 3D medical image analysis with minimal supervision, offering an
accessible and affordable alternative for resource-constrained settings.

applications. However, many state-of-the-art methods, primarily based on
transformer architectures, suffer from severe scalability issues because they
rely on full attention across image tokens from multiple input views, resulting
in prohibitive computational costs as the number of views or image resolution
increases. Toward a scalable and efficient feed-forward 3D reconstruction, we
introduce an iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model (iLRM) that generates 3D
Gaussian representations through an iterative refinement mechanism, guided by
three core principles: (1) decoupling the scene representation from input-view
images to enable compact 3D representations; (2) decomposing fully-attentional
multi-view interactions into a two-stage attention scheme to reduce
computational costs; and (3) injecting high-resolution information at every
layer to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results on widely
used datasets, such as RE10K and DL3DV, demonstrate that iLRM outperforms
existing methods in both reconstruction quality and speed. Notably, iLRM
exhibits superior scalability, delivering significantly higher reconstruction
quality under comparable computational cost by efficiently leveraging a larger
number of input views.

*Hao Tang,Chenwei Xie,Xiaoyi Bao,Tingyu Weng,Pandeng Li,Yun Zheng,Liwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniLIP扩展了CLIP的功能，通过两阶段训练和自蒸馏策略，使其在保持理解能力的同时支持重建、生成和编辑任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有CLIP统一方法在重建和生成任务中需要额外解码器或量化的问题，避免性能下降。

Method: 采用两阶段训练和自蒸馏策略，提出双条件架构连接MLLM和扩散变换器。

Result: 在生成和编辑任务中表现优异，超越同类统一模型。

Conclusion: UniLIP扩展了CLIP的应用范围，使其在理解和生成任务中均具竞争力。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniLIP, which extends CLIP to reconstruction,
generation and editing, thereby building a unified tokenizer upon its
exceptional comprehension capabilities. Previous CLIP-based unified methods
often require additional diffusion decoders or quantization to support
reconstruction and generation tasks, leading to inconsistent reconstruction or
degradation of original comprehension performance.In contrast, we introduce a
two-stage training scheme and a self-distillation strategy that progressively
integrates reconstruction capabilities into CLIP, allowing it to maintain
original comprehension performance while achieving effective image
reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a dual-condition architecture to
connect the MLLM and diffusion transformer, using both learnable queries and
the last layer multimodal hidden states as joint conditions. This method not
only enables the utilization of the MLLM's strong reasoning capabilities in
generation tasks, but also maximizes the exploitation of the rich information
in UniLIP features during editing tasks. In text-to-image generation tasks,
UniLIP obtains scores of 0.87 and 0.53 on GenEval and WISE benchmark
respectively, surpassing all previous unified models of similar scale. In image
editing, UniLIP also achieves a score of 3.62 on the ImgEdit Benchmark,
surpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as BAGEL and UniWorld-V1. UniLIP
effectively expand the application scope of CLIP, enabling continuous CLIP
features to not only serve as the optimal choice for understanding tasks but
also achieve highly competitive performance in generation and editing tasks.

TL;DR: BLiM框架通过双向似然估计和候选先验归一化（CPN）解决文本-视频检索中的候选先验偏差问题，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法直接应用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）时，会因候选先验偏差而偏向高先验的候选，而非与查询更相关的候选。

Method: 提出BLiM框架，结合双向似然估计（生成文本和视频特征）和CPN模块（无训练分数校准）以减少偏差。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，BLiM+CPN平均R@1提升6.4%，有效缓解偏差并增强查询-候选相关性。

Conclusion: BLiM和CPN不仅适用于检索任务，还能提升多模态任务的视觉理解能力。

Abstract: Text-Video Retrieval aims to find the most relevant text (or video) candidate
given a video (or text) query from large-scale online databases. Recent work
leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to improve retrieval,
especially for long or complex query-candidate pairs. However, we observe that
the naive application of MLLMs, i.e., retrieval based on candidate likelihood,
introduces candidate prior bias, favoring candidates with inherently higher
priors over those more relevant to the query. To this end, we propose a novel
retrieval framework, Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM),
which leverages both query and candidate likelihoods by training the model to
generate text from a given video as well as video features from a given text.
Furthermore, we introduce Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN), a simple yet
effective training-free score calibration module designed to mitigate candidate
prior bias in candidate likelihood. On four Text-Video Retrieval benchmarks,
our BLiM equipped with CPN outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 6.4
R@1 on average, effectively alleviating candidate prior bias and emphasizing
query-candidate relevance. Our in-depth analysis across various multi-modal
tasks beyond retrieval highlights the broad applicability of CPN which enhances
visual understanding by reducing reliance on textual priors. Code is available

Motivation: 尽管文档布局分析技术有所进步，但仍存在区域合并、分割和内容缺失等结构错误，传统评估指标（如IoU和mAP）无法有效检测这些错误。

Method: 提出Layout Error Detection (LED)基准，定义八种标准化错误类型，并设计三项任务：错误存在检测、错误类型分类和元素级错误类型分类。构建合成数据集LED-Dataset。

Result: 实验结果表明，LED能有效区分不同模型的结构理解能力，揭示传统指标无法发现的模态偏差和性能权衡。

Conclusion: LED为文档布局分析提供了一种更全面的评估方法，弥补了传统指标的不足。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Document Layout Analysis through Large Language Models
and Multimodal Models have significantly improved layout detection. However,
despite these improvements, challenges remain in addressing critical structural
errors, such as region merging, splitting, and missing content. Conventional
evaluation metrics like IoU and mAP, which focus primarily on spatial overlap,
are insufficient for detecting these errors. To address this limitation, we
propose Layout Error Detection (LED), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
the structural robustness of document layout predictions. LED defines eight
standardized error types, and formulates three complementary tasks: error
existence detection, error type classification, and element-wise error type
classification. Furthermore, we construct LED-Dataset, a synthetic dataset
generated by injecting realistic structural errors based on empirical
distributions from DLA models. Experimental results across a range of LMMs
reveal that LED effectively differentiates structural understanding
capabilities, exposing modality biases and performance trade-offs not visible
through traditional metrics.

Motivation: 现有基于扩散的编辑方法在处理大或复杂变换时效果不佳，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用解耦管道，结合训练无关的扩散方法FreeFine，分别处理对象变换、源区域修复和目标区域细化。

Result: 在GeoBench基准测试中，FreeFine在图像保真度和编辑精度上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FreeFine为几何图像编辑提供了一种高效且精确的解决方案，尤其适用于复杂变换场景。

Abstract: We tackle the task of geometric image editing, where an object within an
image is repositioned, reoriented, or reshaped while preserving overall scene
coherence. Previous diffusion-based editing methods often attempt to handle all
relevant subtasks in a single step, proving difficult when transformations
become large or structurally complex. We address this by proposing a decoupled
pipeline that separates object transformation, source region inpainting, and
target region refinement. Both inpainting and refinement are implemented using
a training-free diffusion approach, FreeFine. In experiments on our new
GeoBench benchmark, which contains both 2D and 3D editing scenarios, FreeFine
outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in image fidelity, and edit
precision, especially under demanding transformations. Code and benchmark are

TL;DR: ST-SAM提出了一种高效的半监督伪装目标检测框架，通过动态筛选高置信度伪标签和利用Segment Anything Model，显著减少对标注数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督伪装目标检测方法存在预测偏差、错误传播和高计算开销问题，ST-SAM旨在解决这些限制。

Method: 采用自训练策略动态扩展高置信度伪标签，并结合Segment Anything Model的潜力，避免多模型架构。

Result: 在仅1%标注数据下，ST-SAM性能优于现有方法，甚至媲美全监督方法。

Conclusion: ST-SAM为高效标注的半监督伪装目标检测提供了新范式。

Abstract: Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (SSCOD) aims to reduce reliance
on costly pixel-level annotations by leveraging limited annotated data and
abundant unlabeled data. However, existing SSCOD methods based on
Teacher-Student frameworks suffer from severe prediction bias and error
propagation under scarce supervision, while their multi-network architectures
incur high computational overhead and limited scalability. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ST-SAM, a highly annotation-efficient yet concise
framework that breaks away from conventional SSCOD constraints. Specifically,
ST-SAM employs Self-Training strategy that dynamically filters and expands
high-confidence pseudo-labels to enhance a single-model architecture, thereby
fundamentally circumventing inter-model prediction bias. Furthermore, by
transforming pseudo-labels into hybrid prompts containing domain-specific
knowledge, ST-SAM effectively harnesses the Segment Anything Model's potential
for specialized tasks to mitigate error accumulation in self-training.
Experiments on COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SAM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1\% labeled data, outperforming existing
SSCOD methods and even matching fully supervised methods. Remarkably, ST-SAM
requires training only a single network, without relying on specific models or
loss functions. This work establishes a new paradigm for annotation-efficient
SSCOD. Codes will be available at https://github.com/hu-xh/ST-SAM.

Motivation: 复杂环境下自动驾驶需独立感知道路元素，现有方法因未充分利用结构化先验导致预测不准确。

Method: 结合实例感知注意力机制、数据驱动形状模板空间和扩散框架，生成参考先验以优化预测。

Result: 大规模数据集实验显示方法显著提升感知精度，尤其在挑战性条件下。

Conclusion: PriorFusion能生成更准确、规则且连贯的道路元素预测。

Abstract: With the growing interest in autonomous driving, there is an increasing
demand for accurate and reliable road perception technologies. In complex
environments without high-definition map support, autonomous vehicles must
independently interpret their surroundings to ensure safe and robust
decision-making. However, these scenarios pose significant challenges due to
the large number, complex geometries, and frequent occlusions of road elements.
A key limitation of existing approaches lies in their insufficient exploitation
of the structured priors inherently present in road elements, resulting in
irregular, inaccurate predictions. To address this, we propose PriorFusion, a
unified framework that effectively integrates semantic, geometric, and
generative priors to enhance road element perception. We introduce an
instance-aware attention mechanism guided by shape-prior features, then
construct a data-driven shape template space that encodes low-dimensional
representations of road elements, enabling clustering to generate anchor points
as reference priors. We design a diffusion-based framework that leverages these
prior anchors to generate accurate and complete predictions. Experiments on
large-scale autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly improves perception accuracy, particularly under challenging
conditions. Visualization results further confirm that our approach produces
more accurate, regular, and coherent predictions of road elements.

Conclusion: 揭示了大规模生成模型如何在没有明确监督的情况下表示复杂艺术概念，并提供了可视化工具。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
generating artistic content by learning from billions of images, including
popular artworks. However, the fundamental question of how these models
internally represent concepts, such as content and style in paintings, remains
unexplored. Traditional computer vision assumes content and style are
orthogonal, but diffusion models receive no explicit guidance about this
distinction during training. In this work, we investigate how transformer-based
text-to-image diffusion models encode content and style concepts when
generating artworks. We leverage cross-attention heatmaps to attribute pixels
in generated images to specific prompt tokens, enabling us to isolate image
regions influenced by content-describing versus style-describing tokens. Our
findings reveal that diffusion models demonstrate varying degrees of
content-style separation depending on the specific artistic prompt and style
requested. In many cases, content tokens primarily influence object-related
regions while style tokens affect background and texture areas, suggesting an
emergent understanding of the content-style distinction. These insights
contribute to our understanding of how large-scale generative models internally
represent complex artistic concepts without explicit supervision. We share the
code and dataset, together with an exploratory tool for visualizing attention
maps at https://github.com/umilISLab/artistic-prompt-interpretation.

Conclusion: 研究结果为构建适用于实时图像处理的高效深度学习模型提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Lightweight convolutional and transformer-based models have become vital for
real-time image classification in resource-constrained applications, such as
embedded systems and edge devices. This work analyzes the influence of
hyperparameter adjustment on the accuracy and convergence behavior of seven
efficient deep learning architectures: EfficientNetV2-S, ConvNeXt-T, MobileViT
v2 (XXS/XS/S), MobileNetV3-L, TinyViT-21M, and RepVGG-A2. All models are
trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset under consistent training settings, with an
emphasis on real-time practicality. An comprehensive ablation study is
undertaken to separate the effect of critical hyperparameters, including
learning rate schedules, batch sizes, input resolution, data augmentation,
regularization approaches, and optimizer choice. To assess appropriateness for
real-time applications, each model is assessed not only in terms of Top-1 and
Top-5 classification accuracy, but also in terms of inference time, parameter
count, model size, and frames-per-second (FPS) on a GPU-accelerated edge
deployment simulation. Results demonstrate that cosine learning rate decay and
adjustable batch size may greatly boost both accuracy and convergence speed,
while keeping low latency and memory cost. Notably, RepVGG-A2 achieves over 80%
Top-1 accuracy with efficient inference performance, offering a compelling
balance between accuracy and deployment cost for VGG-style models. The results
give practical guidance for constructing resource-efficient deep learning
models appropriate for real-time image processing pipelines. All code and

Motivation: VLA模型在自动驾驶中表现出潜力，但视觉令牌过长导致计算成本高，现有修剪方法效果不佳。人类驾驶时关注前景区域，因此保留前景信息对决策至关重要。

Method: 提出FastDriveVLA框架，包括ReconPruner修剪器，通过MAE风格像素重建优先保留前景信息，并设计对抗性前景-背景重建策略进行训练。

Result: 在nuScenes闭环规划基准测试中，不同修剪比例下均取得最优结果。

Conclusion: FastDriveVLA通过专注于前景信息，显著提升了自动驾驶场景下的视觉令牌修剪效果。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential
in complex scene understanding and action reasoning, leading to their
increasing adoption in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the long
visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current
visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either
visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor
performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers
concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that
retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for
effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel
reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for
autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner
called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style
pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction
strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models.
Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models
with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also
introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K
image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark across
different pruning ratios.

Result: 在OpenLane-V2基准测试中，FASTopoWM在车道段检测（mAP 37.4%）和中心线感知（OLS 46.3%）上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FASTopoWM通过改进时间传播和减少姿态估计依赖，显著提升了车道拓扑推理性能。

Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning provides comprehensive bird's-eye view (BEV)
road scene understanding, which can serve as a key perception module in
planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Existing lane topology
reasoning methods often fall short in effectively leveraging temporal
information to enhance detection and reasoning performance. Recently,
stream-based temporal propagation method has demonstrated promising results by
incorporating temporal cues at both the query and BEV levels. However, it
remains limited by over-reliance on historical queries, vulnerability to pose
estimation failures, and insufficient temporal propagation. To overcome these
limitations, we propose FASTopoWM, a novel fast-slow lane segment topology
reasoning framework augmented with latent world models. To reduce the impact of
pose estimation failures, this unified framework enables parallel supervision
of both historical and newly initialized queries, facilitating mutual
reinforcement between the fast and slow systems. Furthermore, we introduce
latent query and BEV world models conditioned on the action latent to propagate
the state representations from past observations to the current timestep. This
design substantially improves the performance of temporal perception within the
slow pipeline. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate
that FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment
detection (37.4% v.s. 33.6% on mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% v.s. 41.5%
on OLS).

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过特征扰动和一致性约束，有效解决了医学图像分割中的领域偏移问题，提升了模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical workflows, but
domain shift often leads to performance degradation when models are applied to
unseen clinical domains. This challenge arises due to variations in imaging
conditions, scanner types, and acquisition protocols, limiting the practical
deployment of segmentation models. Unlike natural images, medical images
typically exhibit consistent anatomical structures across patients, with
domain-specific variations mainly caused by imaging conditions. This unique
characteristic makes medical image segmentation particularly challenging.
  To address this challenge, we propose a domain generalization framework
tailored for medical image segmentation. Our approach improves robustness to
domain-specific variations by introducing implicit feature perturbations guided
by domain statistics. Specifically, we employ a learnable semantic direction
selector and a covariance-based semantic intensity sampler to modulate
domain-variant features while preserving task-relevant anatomical consistency.
Furthermore, we design an adaptive consistency constraint that is selectively
applied only when feature adjustment leads to degraded segmentation
performance. This constraint encourages the adjusted features to align with the
original predictions, thereby stabilizing feature selection and improving the
reliability of the segmentation.
  Extensive experiments on two public multi-center benchmarks show that our
framework consistently outperforms existing domain generalization approaches,
achieving robust and generalizable segmentation performance across diverse
clinical domains.

Conclusion: 该方法显著优于主流算法，在复杂开放场景中表现出更高的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Traffic sign recognition, as a core component of autonomous driving
perception systems, directly influences vehicle environmental awareness and
driving safety. Current technologies face two significant challenges: first,
the traffic sign dataset exhibits a pronounced long-tail distribution,
resulting in a substantial decline in recognition performance of traditional
convolutional networks when processing low-frequency and out-of-distribution
classes; second, traffic signs in real-world scenarios are predominantly small
targets with significant scale variations, making it difficult to extract
multi-scale features.To overcome these issues, we propose a novel two-stage
framework combining open-vocabulary detection and cross-modal learning. For
traffic sign detection, our NanoVerse YOLO model integrates a reparameterizable
vision-language path aggregation network (RepVL-PAN) and an SPD-Conv module to
specifically enhance feature extraction for small, multi-scale targets. For
traffic sign classification, we designed a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal
Contrastive Learning model (TSR-MCL). By contrasting visual features from a
Vision Transformer with semantic features from a rule-based BERT, TSR-MCL
learns robust, frequency-independent representations, effectively mitigating
class confusion caused by data imbalance. On the TT100K dataset, our method
achieves a state-of-the-art 78.4% mAP in the long-tail detection task for
all-class recognition. The model also obtains 91.8% accuracy and 88.9% recall,
significantly outperforming mainstream algorithms and demonstrating superior
accuracy and generalization in complex, open-world scenarios.

Conclusion: 该框架在复杂城市环境中实现了高质量的道路表面重建，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Road surface reconstruction is essential for autonomous driving, supporting
centimeter-accurate lane perception and high-definition mapping in complex
urban environments.While recent methods based on mesh rendering or 3D Gaussian
splatting (3DGS) achieve promising results under clean and static conditions,
they remain vulnerable to occlusions from dynamic agents, visual clutter from
static obstacles, and appearance degradation caused by lighting and weather
changes. We present a robust reconstruction framework that integrates
occlusion-aware 2D Gaussian surfels with semantic-guided color enhancement to
recover clean, consistent road surfaces. Our method leverages a planar-adapted
Gaussian representation for efficient large-scale modeling, employs
segmentation-guided video inpainting to remove both dynamic and static
foreground objects, and enhances color coherence via semantic-aware correction
in HSV space. Extensive experiments on urban-scale datasets demonstrate that
our framework produces visually coherent and geometrically faithful
reconstructions, significantly outperforming prior methods under real-world
conditions.

*Ahmet Can Ömercikoğlu,Mustafa Mansur Yönügül,Pakize Erdoğmuş*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究了输入分辨率对三种深度学习人脸检测器性能的影响，发现YOLOv11在高分辨率下表现最佳，YOLOv12召回率略高，MTCNN在实时性上较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的低分辨率图像会降低人脸检测性能，因此需要系统研究分辨率对检测器的影响。

Method: 使用WIDER FACE数据集，在多种分辨率（160x160至640x640）下评估YOLOv11、YOLOv12和MTCNN的性能指标（如精度、召回率、mAP等）。

Result: YOLOv11在高分辨率下准确率最高，YOLOv12召回率较好，MTCNN在实时性上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究结果为根据不同操作约束选择分辨率敏感的人脸检测模型提供了实用建议。

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as
surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.
However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and
MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across
multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each
model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

TL;DR: 论文提出了最大的AGTH质量评估数据集THQA-10K，评估了12种T2I模型和14种talker生成的AGTHs，并提出了基于主观和客观评估的质量分析方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI生成说话头部（AGTHs）的质量问题缺乏系统性研究，因此需要构建大规模数据集并开发评估方法。

Method: 通过THQA-10K数据集（包含10,457个AGTHs），招募志愿者进行主观评分，并提出基于第一帧、Y-T切片和音唇一致性的客观评估方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，提出的客观评估方法在AGTH质量评估中达到了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: THQA-10K数据集和提出的评估方法为AGTH质量研究提供了重要工具，并揭示了现有AGTHs的失真问题。

Abstract: Speech-driven methods for portraits are figuratively known as "Talkers"
because of their capability to synthesize speaking mouth shapes and facial
movements. Especially with the rapid development of the Text-to-Image (T2I)
models, AI-Generated Talking Heads (AGTHs) have gradually become an emerging
digital human media. However, challenges persist regarding the quality of these
talkers and AGTHs they generate, and comprehensive studies addressing these
issues remain limited. To address this gap, this paper presents the largest
AGTH quality assessment dataset THQA-10K to date, which selects 12 prominent
T2I models and 14 advanced talkers to generate AGTHs for 14 prompts. After
excluding instances where AGTH generation is unsuccessful, the THQA-10K dataset
contains 10,457 AGTHs. Then, volunteers are recruited to subjectively rate the
AGTHs and give the corresponding distortion categories. In our analysis for
subjective experimental results, we evaluate the performance of talkers in
terms of generalizability and quality, and also expose the distortions of
existing AGTHs. Finally, an objective quality assessment method based on the
first frame, Y-T slice and tone-lip consistency is proposed. Experimental
results show that this method can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
in AGTH quality assessment. The work is released at

TL;DR: 该报告分析了计算机视觉中关键设计模式的演变，通过六篇有影响力的论文，从基础架构到生成模型和自监督学习技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨计算机视觉领域的关键设计模式如何从基础架构发展到生成模型和自监督学习，以推动技术进步。

Method: 分析六篇论文，包括ResNet、ViT、GANs、LDMs、DINO和MAE，总结其核心方法和贡献。

Result: ResNet解决了梯度消失问题，ViT引入注意力机制，GANs和LDMs推动了生成模型，DINO和MAE提升了自监督学习效果。

Conclusion: 计算机视觉的设计模式从基础架构到生成模型和自监督学习不断演进，推动了领域的发展。

Abstract: This report analyzes the evolution of key design patterns in computer vision
by examining six influential papers. The analy- sis begins with foundational
architectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced
residual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable
effective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks.
Subsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new
paradigm by applying the Transformer ar- chitecture to sequences of image
patches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale
image recogni- tion. Building on these visual representation backbones, we
investigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are
analyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a
generator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then,
Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative
methods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually
compressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater
computational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image
generation. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce
dependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a
student network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher,
yielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with
Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design
to reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective
method for pre-training large-scale vision models.

*Ji Ma,Wei Suo,Peng Wang,Yanning Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）的层修剪问题，发现直接应用NLP的修剪方法无效，并提出新框架Short-LVLM以优化性能与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLM的实际应用受限于庞大的参数和高计算成本，而NLP的层修剪方法是否适用于LVLM尚不明确。

Method: 通过实验发现视觉语言（VL）令牌和层间特征差距是关键问题，提出Short-LVLM框架以利用重要令牌并减少特征差距。

Result: Short-LVLM在性能和效率之间取得更好平衡，且具有无需训练、模型无关和高兼容性等优势。

Conclusion: Short-LVLM为LVLM的层修剪提供了有效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning, their practical
applications are still limited by massive model parameters and high
computational costs. Recent efforts from natural language processing (NLP) have
shown the effectiveness of layer pruning, offering a plausible training-free
compression solution. However, due to the modality divergence between vision
and language, it is unclear whether these NLP techniques are still effective in
LVLMs. In this paper, we empirically prove that directly applying these layer
pruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective. Through extensive experiments, we find
that non-essential vision-language (VL) tokens and inter-layer feature gaps
pose critical challenges to pruning layers in LVLMs. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel framework Short-LVLM (SVL) that can utilize important VL
tokens and mitigate the layer-wise feature gaps. Notably, Short-LVLM not only
achieves a superior trade-off between performance and efficiency but also
exhibits several potential advantages, i.e., training-free, model-agnostic, and
highly compatible. The code for this work is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于学习的方法依赖Transformer的注意力机制，计算成本高；Mamba的线性复杂度提供了效率优势，但需要结合Transformer的性能。

Method: 提出VMatcher，混合Mamba和Transformer，包括分层架构，以平衡效率和性能。

Result: VMatcher在高效性和性能上均达到新基准，适用于实时应用。

Conclusion: VMatcher通过混合设计在特征匹配任务中实现了高效与高性能的平衡。

Abstract: This paper introduces VMatcher, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer network for
semi-dense feature matching between image pairs. Learning-based feature
matching methods, whether detector-based or detector-free, achieve
state-of-the-art performance but depend heavily on the Transformer's attention
mechanism, which, while effective, incurs high computational costs due to its
quadratic complexity. In contrast, Mamba introduces a Selective State-Space
Model (SSM) that achieves comparable or superior performance with linear
complexity, offering significant efficiency gains. VMatcher leverages a hybrid
approach, integrating Mamba's highly efficient long-sequence processing with
the Transformer's attention mechanism. Multiple VMatcher configurations are
proposed, including hierarchical architectures, demonstrating their
effectiveness in setting new benchmarks efficiently while ensuring robustness
and practicality for real-time applications where rapid inference is crucial.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniEmo是一个统一框架，将情感理解与生成任务结合，通过层次化情感链和扩散模型实现，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感理解与生成任务通常是分开处理的，但它们本质互补，可以相互增强。

Method: 提出层次化情感理解链和专家查询，结合扩散模型生成情感图像，并引入情感相关系数和条件损失。

Result: UniEmo在情感理解与生成任务上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过联合训练和生成驱动的双重反馈，UniEmo提升了模型的情感理解能力。

Abstract: Emotional understanding and generation are often treated as separate tasks,
yet they are inherently complementary and can mutually enhance each other. In
this paper, we propose the UniEmo, a unified framework that seamlessly
integrates these two tasks. The key challenge lies in the abstract nature of
emotions, necessitating the extraction of visual representations beneficial for
both tasks. To address this, we propose a hierarchical emotional understanding
chain with learnable expert queries that progressively extracts multi-scale
emotional features, thereby serving as a foundational step for unification.
Simultaneously, we fuse these expert queries and emotional representations to
guide the diffusion model in generating emotion-evoking images. To enhance the
diversity and fidelity of the generated emotional images, we further introduce
the emotional correlation coefficient and emotional condition loss into the
fusion process. This step facilitates fusion and alignment for emotional
generation guided by the understanding. In turn, we demonstrate that joint
training allows the generation component to provide implicit feedback to the
understanding part. Furthermore, we propose a novel data filtering algorithm to
select high-quality and diverse emotional images generated by the well-trained
model, which explicitly feedback into the understanding part. Together, these
generation-driven dual feedback processes enhance the model's understanding
capacity. Extensive experiments show that UniEmo significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both emotional understanding and generation tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种渐进式对齐策略MP^2A，用于改进CLIP在多源无监督域适应中的性能，通过逐步引入高置信度样本减少噪声影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法一次性对齐所有伪标签数据，容易受噪声和难分类样本影响，导致误差传播和次优特征学习。

Method: MP^2A首先在高置信度目标样本上训练模型，逐步引入更具挑战性的样本，以减少初始标签噪声的干扰。

Result: 在ImageCLEF、Office-Home和DomainNet三个基准测试中，MP^2A表现优于现有CLIP基多源无监督域适应方法。

Conclusion: 渐进式对齐策略有效减少确认偏差，提升模型鲁棒性，实现真正的域不变特征学习。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models like CLIP have become a powerful foundation for
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation due to their strong zero-shot generalization.
State-of-the-art methods typically leverage CLIP to generate pseudo-labels for
the target domain, then fine-tune the model to learn domain-invariant features.
However, these methods attempt to align source and target domains using all
pseudo-labeled data simultaneously. This one-shot alignment struggles with
noisy, hard-to-classify samples, leading to error propagation and suboptimal
feature learning. The problem is even more amplified in the multi-source
scenario, where diverse domain gaps and varying noise levels across multiple
source domains further destabilize the alignment process. To address this
issue, in this work, we propose a progressive alignment strategy for adapting
CLIP to unlabeled downstream task. Our method begins by training the model on a
high-confidence subset of target samples, allowing it to first learn a
well-aligned representation from the most reliable data. As training
progresses, it gradually incorporates more challenging samples, guiding the
model to refine its understanding without being overwhelmed by initial label
noise. This progressive approach effectively mitigates confirmation bias and
promotes a more robust convergence, allowing for the learning of genuinely
domain-invariant features. We name our approach MP^2A and test it on three
popular UDA benchmarks, namely ImageCLEF, Office-Home, and the most challenging
DomainNet. Experiments showcase that MP^2A achieves state-of-the-art
performance when compared with most recent CLIP-based MS-UDA approaches,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3DGS在初始化敏感性、空间感知和相关性方面的不足。

Method: 通过共享3D空间信息，逐步对齐NeRF和3DGS的空间特征，并优化残差向量。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，达到SOTA。

Conclusion: NeRF和3DGS是互补的，为混合方法提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce NeRF-GS, a novel framework that jointly optimizes Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). This framework
leverages the inherent continuous spatial representation of NeRF to mitigate
several limitations of 3DGS, including sensitivity to Gaussian initialization,
limited spatial awareness, and weak inter-Gaussian correlations, thereby
enhancing its performance. In NeRF-GS, we revisit the design of 3DGS and
progressively align its spatial features with NeRF, enabling both
representations to be optimized within the same scene through shared 3D spatial
information. We further address the formal distinctions between the two
approaches by optimizing residual vectors for both implicit features and
Gaussian positions to enhance the personalized capabilities of 3DGS.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that NeRF-GS surpasses existing
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This outcome confirms that
NeRF and 3DGS are complementary rather than competing, offering new insights
into hybrid approaches that combine 3DGS and NeRF for efficient 3D scene
representation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为AGA的新框架，通过双向分组机制和自适应阈值门控模块，从医学图像和报告中捕获结构化语义，无需依赖大量负样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学领域的视觉语言预训练方法简化了临床报告的结构，且对比学习框架依赖大量负样本，这在小型医学数据集中不切实际。

Method: AGA框架通过稀疏相似矩阵进行双向分组，动态学习分组阈值，并引入实例感知组对齐损失和双向跨模态分组对齐模块。

Result: 在公开和私有数据集上的实验表明，AGA在图像-文本检索和分类任务中表现优异，适用于微调和零样本设置。

Conclusion: AGA通过结构化语义捕获和自适应分组，有效解决了医学领域视觉语言预训练的挑战。

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from paired images and reports is a
promising direction in representation learning. However, current
vision-language pretraining methods in the medical domain often simplify
clinical reports into single entities or fragmented tokens, ignoring their
inherent structure. In addition, contrastive learning frameworks typically
depend on large quantities of hard negative samples, which is impractical for
small-scale medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive
Grouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics
from paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping
mechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we
compute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches. Each
token selects its top-matching patches to form a visual group, and each patch
selects its most related tokens to form a language group. To enable adaptive
grouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped
Threshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping
thresholds dynamically. Group representations are computed as weighted averages
based on similarity scores. To align each token with its group representation,
we introduce an Instance Aware Group Alignment loss that operates within each
image-text pair, removing the need for external negatives. Finally, a
Bidirectional Cross-modal Grouped Alignment module is applied to enhance
fine-grained alignment between visual and linguistic group representations.
Extensive experiments on public and private datasets show that our method
achieves strong performance on image-text retrieval and classification tasks
under both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有生成方法在计算成本高、不可靠及需要重新训练等问题，提高医学影像中异常检测的效率和鲁棒性。

Method: 利用SBDDM的前向扩散轨迹，通过Stein分数捕捉轨迹曲率，仅需五步扩散即可实现异常评分。

Result: 在Near-OOD和Far-OOD检测中分别相对提升10.43%和18.10%，计算成本大幅降低。

Conclusion: SBDDM是一种高效、可靠的OOD检测方法，适用于实时计算机辅助诊断。

Abstract: In medical imaging, unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection offers
an attractive approach for identifying pathological cases with extremely low
incidence rates. In contrast to supervised methods, OOD-based approaches
function without labels and are inherently robust to data imbalances. Current
generative approaches often rely on likelihood estimation or reconstruction
error, but these methods can be computationally expensive, unreliable, and
require retraining if the inlier data changes. These limitations hinder their
ability to distinguish nominal from anomalous inputs efficiently, consistently,
and robustly. We propose a reconstruction-free OOD detection method that
leverages the forward diffusion trajectories of a Stein score-based denoising
diffusion model (SBDDM). By capturing trajectory curvature via the estimated
Stein score, our approach enables accurate anomaly scoring with only five
diffusion steps. A single SBDDM pre-trained on a large, semantically aligned
medical dataset generalizes effectively across multiple Near-OOD and Far-OOD
benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while drastically reducing
computational cost during inference. Compared to existing methods, SBDDM
achieves a relative improvement of up to 10.43% and 18.10% for Near-OOD and
Far-OOD detection, making it a practical building block for real-time, reliable
computer-aided diagnosis.

Result: 在公开数据集上测试，系统交叉验证准确率为96.39%。

Conclusion: 该系统可作为化学检测方法的有效替代方案。

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a machine learning-based system for automatically
detecting honey adulteration with sugar syrup, based on honey hyperspectral
imaging data. First, the floral source of a honey sample is classified by a
botanical origin identification subsystem. Then, the sugar syrup adulteration
is identified, and its concentration is quantified by an adulteration detection
subsystem. Both subsystems consist of two steps. The first step involves
extracting relevant features from the honey sample using Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA). In the second step, we utilize the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
model to classify the honey botanical origin in the first subsystem and
identify the adulteration level in the second subsystem. We assess the proposed
system performance on a public honey hyperspectral image dataset. The result
indicates that the proposed system can detect adulteration in honey with an
overall cross-validation accuracy of 96.39%, making it an appropriate
alternative to the current chemical-based detection methods.

Motivation: 艺术风格分类因缺乏专家标注数据集和风格元素间的复杂非线性交互而具有挑战性。现有双教师自监督框架的线性投影层和局部关注难以建模全局构图和复杂风格特征交互。

Method: 改进双教师知识蒸馏框架，用KANs替代MLP投影和预测头，保留双教师网络的互补指导，并利用KANs的样条激活精确建模非线性特征相关性。

Result: 在WikiArt和Pandora18k数据集上的实验表明，该方法在Top-1准确率上优于基础双教师架构，且KANs能更好地解耦复杂风格流形。

Conclusion: KANs在建模非线性特征交互和解耦风格流形方面具有优势，显著提升了艺术风格分类的性能。

Abstract: Art style classification remains a formidable challenge in computational
aesthetics due to the scarcity of expertly labeled datasets and the intricate,
often nonlinear interplay of stylistic elements. While recent dual-teacher
self-supervised frameworks reduce reliance on labeled data, their linear
projection layers and localized focus struggle to model global compositional
context and complex style-feature interactions. We enhance the dual-teacher
knowledge distillation framework to address these limitations by replacing
conventional MLP projection and prediction heads with Kolmogorov-Arnold
Networks (KANs). Our approach retains complementary guidance from two teacher
networks, one emphasizing localized texture and brushstroke patterns, the other
capturing broader stylistic hierarchies while leveraging KANs' spline-based
activations to model nonlinear feature correlations with mathematical
precision. Experiments on WikiArt and Pandora18k demonstrate that our approach
outperforms the base dual teacher architecture in Top-1 accuracy. Our findings
highlight the importance of KANs in disentangling complex style manifolds,
leading to better linear probe accuracy than MLP projections.

Conclusion: HyCASS为超光谱图像压缩提供了有效的可调谐解决方案，并公开了代码和预训练模型。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of hyperspectral data archives in remote sensing (RS),
the need for efficient storage has become essential, driving significant
attention toward learning-based hyperspectral image (HSI) compression. However,
a comprehensive investigation of the individual and joint effects of spectral
and spatial compression on learning-based HSI compression has not been
thoroughly examined yet. Conducting such an analysis is crucial for
understanding how the exploitation of spectral, spatial, and joint
spatio-spectral redundancies affects HSI compression. To address this issue, we
propose Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network
(HyCASS), a learning-based model designed for adjustable HSI compression in
both spectral and spatial dimensions. HyCASS consists of six main modules: 1)
spectral encoder; 2) spatial encoder; 3) compression ratio (CR) adapter
encoder; 4) CR adapter decoder; 5) spatial decoder; and 6) spectral decoder
module. The modules employ convolutional layers and transformer blocks to
capture both short-range and long-range redundancies. Experimental results on
two HSI benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
adjustable model compared to existing learning-based compression models. Based
on our results, we establish a guideline for effectively balancing spectral and
spatial compression across different CRs, taking into account the spatial
resolution of the HSIs. Our code and pre-trained model weights are publicly
available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/hycass .

Abstract: Machine learning and artificial intelligence are fast-growing fields of

CNN and DenseNet-121 perform very well in the binary classification problem
presented in this work. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping shows that
DenseNet-121 correctly focuses on essential parts of the input chest X-ray
images in its decision-making more than the baseline CNN.

distributed systems, while preserving user data privacy. To date, research has
primarily focused on addressing statistical heterogeneity and communication
efficiency, through which FL has achieved success in classification tasks.
However, its application to non-classification tasks, such as human pose
estimation, remains underexplored. This paper identifies and investigates a
critical issue termed ``resolution-drift,'' where performance degrades
significantly due to resolution variability across clients. Unlike class-level
heterogeneity, resolution drift highlights the importance of resolution as
another axis of not independent or identically distributed (non-IID) data. To
address this issue, we present resolution-adaptive federated learning (RAF), a
method that leverages heatmap-based knowledge distillation. Through
multi-resolution knowledge distillation between higher-resolution outputs
(teachers) and lower-resolution outputs (students), our approach enhances
resolution robustness without overfitting. Extensive experiments and
theoretical analysis demonstrate that RAF not only effectively mitigates
resolution drift and achieves significant performance improvements, but also
can be integrated seamlessly into existing FL frameworks. Furthermore, although
this paper focuses on human pose estimation, our t-SNE analysis reveals
distinct characteristics between classification and high-resolution
representation tasks, supporting the generalizability of RAF to other tasks
that rely on preserving spatial detail.

TL;DR: 论文提出了CST Anti-UAV数据集，专注于复杂场景下微小无人机的单目标追踪，填补了现有数据集的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无人机追踪数据集缺乏多样性和复杂性，限制了其在真实场景中的应用。

Method: 构建了包含220个视频序列和24万高质量标注的CST Anti-UAV数据集，并评估了20种现有SOT方法。

Result: 实验显示，现有方法在复杂环境下追踪微小无人机的准确率仅为35.92%，远低于其他数据集的表现。

Conclusion: CST Anti-UAV数据集的发布将推动更鲁棒的SOT方法和反无人机系统的创新。

Abstract: The widespread application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has raised
serious public safety and privacy concerns, making UAV perception crucial for
anti-UAV tasks. However, existing UAV tracking datasets predominantly feature
conspicuous objects and lack diversity in scene complexity and attribute
representation, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. To
overcome these limitations, we present the CST Anti-UAV, a new thermal infrared
dataset specifically designed for Single Object Tracking (SOT) in Complex
Scenes with Tiny UAVs (CST). It contains 220 video sequences with over 240k
high-quality bounding box annotations, highlighting two key properties: a
significant number of tiny-sized UAV targets and the diverse and complex
scenes. To the best of our knowledge, CST Anti-UAV is the first dataset to
incorporate complete manual frame-level attribute annotations, enabling precise
evaluations under varied challenges. To conduct an in-depth performance
analysis for CST Anti-UAV, we evaluate 20 existing SOT methods on the proposed
dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that tracking tiny UAVs in complex
environments remains a challenge, as the state-of-the-art method achieves only
35.92% state accuracy, much lower than the 67.69% observed on the Anti-UAV410
dataset. These findings underscore the limitations of existing benchmarks and
the need for further advancements in UAV tracking research. The CST Anti-UAV
benchmark is about to be publicly released, which not only fosters the
development of more robust SOT methods but also drives innovation in anti-UAV
systems.

Method: 构建高质量合成数据集Scene-30K，结合RLHF策略（如GRPO）和三种奖励函数，并引入动态视角选择策略。

Result: 实验表明，3D-R1在多个3D场景基准测试中平均提升10%的性能。

Conclusion: 3D-R1有效提升了3D场景理解的推理和泛化能力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in 2D
visual understanding tasks, sparking interest in extending these capabilities
to 3D scene understanding. However, current 3D VLMs often struggle with robust
reasoning and generalization due to limitations in high-quality spatial data
and the static nature of viewpoint assumptions. To address these challenges, we
propose 3D-R1, a foundation model that enhances the reasoning capabilities of
3D VLMs. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality synthetic dataset with
CoT, named Scene-30K, leveraging existing 3D-VL datasets and a data engine
based on Gemini 2.5 Pro. It serves as cold-start initialization data for 3D-R1.
Moreover, we leverage RLHF policy such as GRPO in the reinforcement learning
training process to enhance reasoning capabilities and introduce three reward
functions: a perception reward, a semantic similarity reward and a format
reward to maintain detection accuracy and answer semantic precision.
Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic view selection strategy that adaptively
chooses the most informative perspectives for 3D scene understanding. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that 3D-R1 delivers an average improvement of 10%
across various 3D scene benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing
reasoning and generalization in 3D scene understanding. Code:

Abstract: Video capsule endoscopy has become increasingly important for investigating
the small intestine within the gastrointestinal tract. However, a persistent
challenge remains the short battery lifetime of such compact sensor edge
devices. Integrating artificial intelligence can help overcome this limitation
by enabling intelligent real-time decision- making, thereby reducing the energy
consumption and prolonging the battery life. However, this remains challenging
due to data sparsity and the limited resources of the device restricting the
overall model size. In this work, we introduce a multi-task neural network that
combines the functionalities of precise self-localization within the
gastrointestinal tract with the ability to detect anomalies in the small
intestine within a single model. Throughout the development process, we
consistently restricted the total number of parameters to ensure the
feasibility to deploy such model in a small capsule. We report the first
multi-task results using the recently published Galar dataset, integrating
established multi-task methods and Viterbi decoding for subsequent time-series
analysis. This outperforms current single-task models and represents a
significant ad- vance in AI-based approaches in this field. Our model achieves
an accu- racy of 93.63% on the localization task and an accuracy of 87.48% on
the anomaly detection task. The approach requires only 1 million parameters
while surpassing the current baselines.

exhaustively computing all pairwise distances. Our proposal substantially
accelerates farthest point sampling and neighbor search operations while

into state-of-the-art 3D point cloud models, we achieve 2.55x end-to-end
speedup on NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: Stable-Sim2Real为3D数据模拟提供了高效解决方案，验证了其在真实任务中的实用性。

Abstract: 3D data simulation aims to bridge the gap between simulated and real-captured
3D data, which is a fundamental problem for real-world 3D visual tasks. Most 3D
data simulation methods inject predefined physical priors but struggle to
capture the full complexity of real data. An optimal approach involves learning
an implicit mapping from synthetic to realistic data in a data-driven manner,
but progress in this solution has met stagnation in recent studies. This work
explores a new solution path of data-driven 3D simulation, called
Stable-Sim2Real, based on a novel two-stage depth diffusion model. The initial
stage finetunes Stable-Diffusion to generate the residual between the real and
synthetic paired depth, producing a stable but coarse depth, where some local
regions may deviate from realistic patterns. To enhance this, both the
synthetic and initial output depth are fed into a second-stage diffusion, where
diffusion loss is adjusted to prioritize these distinct areas identified by a
3D discriminator. We provide a new benchmark scheme to evaluate 3D data
simulation methods. Extensive experiments show that training the network with
the 3D simulated data derived from our method significantly enhances
performance in real-world 3D visual tasks. Moreover, the evaluation
demonstrates the high similarity between our 3D simulated data and
real-captured patterns. Project page:

Motivation: 由于频繁的遮挡和姿态变化，传统方法难以准确估计草莓的质量，因此需要一种更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 采用YOLOv8-Seg进行实例分割，CycleGAN完成遮挡区域修复，倾斜角度校正优化投影面积计算，最后通过多项式回归模型将几何特征映射到质量。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动化收获和产量监测提供了鲁棒的解决方案，尤其适用于复杂遮挡场景。

Abstract: Accurate mass estimation of table-top grown strawberries under field
conditions remains challenging due to frequent occlusions and pose variations.
This study proposes a vision-based pipeline integrating RGB-D sensing and deep
learning to enable non-destructive, real-time and online mass estimation. The
method employed YOLOv8-Seg for instance segmentation, Cycle-consistent
generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) for occluded region completion, and
tilt-angle correction to refine frontal projection area calculations. A
polynomial regression model then mapped the geometric features to mass.
Experiments demonstrated mean mass estimation errors of 8.11% for isolated
strawberries and 10.47% for occluded cases. CycleGAN outperformed large mask
inpainting (LaMa) model in occlusion recovery, achieving superior pixel area
ratios (PAR) (mean: 0.978 vs. 1.112) and higher intersection over union (IoU)
scores (92.3% vs. 47.7% in the [0.9-1] range). This approach addresses critical
limitations of traditional methods, offering a robust solution for automated
harvesting and yield monitoring with complex occlusion patterns.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多模态图像配准和融合中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 双曲空间能更敏感且有效地实现多模态图像配准，Hy-CycleAlign为跨模态图像处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Image fusion synthesizes complementary information from multiple sources,
mitigating the inherent limitations of unimodal imaging systems. Accurate image
registration is essential for effective multi-source data fusion. However,
existing registration methods, often based on image translation in Euclidean
space, fail to handle cross-modal misalignment effectively, resulting in
suboptimal alignment and fusion quality. To overcome this limitation, we
explore image alignment in non-Euclidean space and propose a Hyperbolic Cycle
Alignment Network (Hy-CycleAlign). To the best of our knowledge, Hy-CycleAlign
is the first image registration method based on hyperbolic space. It introduces
a dual-path cross-modal cyclic registration framework, in which a forward
registration network aligns cross-modal inputs, while a backward registration
network reconstructs the original image, forming a closed-loop registration
structure with geometric consistency. Additionally, we design a Hyperbolic
Hierarchy Contrastive Alignment (H$^{2}$CA) module, which maps images into
hyperbolic space and imposes registration constraints, effectively reducing
interference caused by modality discrepancies. We further analyze image
registration in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, demonstrating that
hyperbolic space enables more sensitive and effective multi-modal image
registration. Extensive experiments on misaligned multi-modal images
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in
both image alignment and fusion. Our code will be publicly available.

Conclusion: 最小充分像素集是理解模型决策过程的有效工具，不同架构的模型在‘集中度’上存在显著差异。

Abstract: Machine learning for image classification is an active and rapidly developing
field. With the proliferation of classifiers of different sizes and different
architectures, the problem of choosing the right model becomes more and more
important.
  While we can assess a model's classification accuracy statistically, our
understanding of the way these models work is unfortunately limited. In order
to gain insight into the decision-making process of different vision models, we
propose using minimal sufficient pixels sets to gauge a model's
`concentration': the pixels that capture the essence of an image through the
lens of the model. By comparing position, overlap, and size of sets of pixels,
we identify that different architectures have statistically different
concentration, in both size and position. In particular, ConvNext and EVA
models differ markedly from the others. We also identify that images which are
misclassified are associated with larger pixels sets than correct
classifications.

Result: ART在多个测试数据集上显著优于基线方法，并能推断未见过的关系概念。

Conclusion: ART不仅提升了关系检测性能，还能用于复杂场景的分割，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Visual relation detection (VRD) is the task of identifying the relationships
between objects in a scene. VRD models trained solely on relation detection
data struggle to generalize beyond the relations on which they are trained.
While prompt tuning has been used to adapt vision-language models (VLMs) for
VRD, it uses handcrafted prompts and struggles with novel or complex relations.
We argue that instruction tuning offers a more effective solution by
fine-tuning VLMs on diverse instructional data. We thus introduce ART, an
Adaptive Relation Tuning framework that adapts VLMs for VRD through instruction
tuning and strategic instance selection. By converting VRD datasets into an
instruction tuning format and employing an adaptive sampling algorithm, ART
directs the VLM to focus on informative relations while maintaining
generalizability. Specifically, we focus on the relation classification, where
subject-object boxes are given and the model predicts the predicate between
them. We tune on a held-in set and evaluate across multiple held-out datasets
of varying complexity. Our approach strongly improves over its baselines and
can infer unseen relation concepts, a capability absent in mainstream VRD
methods. We demonstrate ART's practical value by using the predicted relations
for segmenting complex scenes.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection is valuable for various applications such as
robotics and AR/VR. Existing methods are confined to closed-set settings, where
the training and testing sets consist of the same scenes and/or object
categories. However, real-world applications often introduce new environments
and novel object categories, posing a challenge to these methods. In this
paper, we address monocular 3D object detection in an open-set setting and
introduce the first end-to-end 3D Monocular Open-set Object Detector (3D-MOOD).
We propose to lift the open-set 2D detection into 3D space through our designed
3D bounding box head, enabling end-to-end joint training for both 2D and 3D
tasks to yield better overall performance. We condition the object queries with
geometry prior and overcome the generalization for 3D estimation across diverse
scenes. To further improve performance, we design the canonical image space for
more efficient cross-dataset training. We evaluate 3D-MOOD on both closed-set

achieve new state-of-the-art results. Code and models are available at

Abstract: Visual localization is the task of estimating a camera pose in a known
environment. In this paper, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based
representations for accurate and privacy-preserving visual localization. We
propose Gaussian Splatting Feature Fields (GSFFs), a scene representation for
visual localization that combines an explicit geometry model (3DGS) with an
implicit feature field. We leverage the dense geometric information and
differentiable rasterization algorithm from 3DGS to learn robust feature
representations grounded in 3D. In particular, we align a 3D scale-aware
feature field and a 2D feature encoder in a common embedding space through a
contrastive framework. Using a 3D structure-informed clustering procedure, we
further regularize the representation learning and seamlessly convert the
features to segmentations, which can be used for privacy-preserving visual
localization. Pose refinement, which involves aligning either feature maps or
segmentations from a query image with those rendered from the GSFFs scene
representation, is used to achieve localization. The resulting privacy- and
non-privacy-preserving localization pipelines, evaluated on multiple real-world
datasets, show state-of-the-art performances.

Conclusion: BeyondGloss展示了免标注SLT框架的有效性，为手语翻译提供了新思路。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a challenging task that requires bridging
the modality gap between visual and linguistic information while capturing
subtle variations in hand shapes and movements. To address these challenges, we
introduce \textbf{BeyondGloss}, a novel gloss-free SLT framework that leverages
the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of Video Large Language Models
(VideoLLMs). Since existing VideoLLMs struggle to model long videos in detail,
we propose a novel approach to generate fine-grained, temporally-aware textual
descriptions of hand motion. A contrastive alignment module aligns these
descriptions with video features during pre-training, encouraging the model to
focus on hand-centric temporal dynamics and distinguish signs more effectively.
To further enrich hand-specific representations, we distill fine-grained
features from HaMeR. Additionally, we apply a contrastive loss between sign
video representations and target language embeddings to reduce the modality gap
in pre-training. \textbf{BeyondGloss} achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the Phoenix14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed framework. We will release the code upon acceptance of the paper.

Conclusion: MamV2XCalib在V2X场景中实现了更优且稳定的校准效果，代码已开源。

Abstract: As cooperative systems that leverage roadside cameras to assist autonomous
vehicle perception become increasingly widespread, large-scale precise
calibration of infrastructure cameras has become a critical issue. Traditional
manual calibration methods are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and may
require road closures. This paper proposes MamV2XCalib, the first V2X-based
infrastructure camera calibration method with the assistance of vehicle-side
LiDAR. MamV2XCalib only requires autonomous vehicles equipped with LiDAR to
drive near the cameras to be calibrated in the infrastructure, without the need
for specific reference objects or manual intervention. We also introduce a new
targetless LiDAR-camera calibration method, which combines multi-scale features
and a 4D correlation volume to estimate the correlation between vehicle-side
point clouds and roadside images. We model the temporal information and
estimate the rotation angles with Mamba, effectively addressing calibration
failures in V2X scenarios caused by defects in the vehicle-side data (such as
occlusions) and large differences in viewpoint. We evaluate MamV2XCalib on the
V2X-Seq and TUMTraf-V2X real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness
and robustness of our V2X-based automatic calibration approach. Compared to
previous LiDAR-camera methods designed for calibration on one car, our approach
achieves better and more stable calibration performance in V2X scenarios with
fewer parameters. The code is available at

Abstract: We present MoGA, a novel method to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian
avatars from a single-view image. The main challenge lies in inferring unseen
appearance and geometric details while ensuring 3D consistency and realism.
Most previous methods rely on 2D diffusion models to synthesize unseen views;
however, these generated views are sparse and inconsistent, resulting in
unrealistic 3D artifacts and blurred appearance. To address these limitations,
we leverage a generative avatar model, that can generate diverse 3D avatars by
sampling deformed Gaussians from a learned prior distribution. Due to the
limited amount of 3D training data such a 3D model alone cannot capture all
image details of unseen identities. Consequently, we integrate it as a prior,
ensuring 3D consistency by projecting input images into its latent space and
enforcing additional 3D appearance and geometric constraints. Our novel
approach formulates Gaussian avatar creation as a model inversion process by
fitting the generative avatar to synthetic views from 2D diffusion models. The
generative avatar provides a meaningful initialization for model fitting,
enforces 3D regularization, and helps in refining pose estimation. Experiments
show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques and generalizes well
to real-world scenarios. Our Gaussian avatars are also inherently animatable

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在3D占用预测中精度与实时性难以兼顾的问题。

Method: 通过切片3D体素特征保留垂直几何信息，结合方向性注意力机制提取多方向几何特征。

Result: 在Occ3D-nuScenes上达到39.3%的mIoU和27.7 FPS的推理速度，边缘设备上为14.8 FPS。

Conclusion: 该方法在精度与效率间取得平衡，适用于自动驾驶系统的实时部署。

Abstract: Efficient and high-accuracy 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for ensuring
the performance of autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, many current
methods focus on high accuracy at the expense of real-time processing needs. To
address this challenge of balancing accuracy and inference speed, we propose a
directional pure 2D approach. Our method involves slicing 3D voxel features to
preserve complete vertical geometric information. This strategy compensates for
the loss of height cues in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representations, thereby
maintaining the integrity of the 3D geometric structure. By employing a
directional attention mechanism, we efficiently extract geometric features from
different orientations, striking a balance between accuracy and computational
efficiency. Experimental results highlight the significant advantages of our
approach for autonomous driving. On the Occ3D-nuScenes, the proposed method
achieves an mIoU of 39.3% and an inference speed of 27.7 FPS, effectively
balancing accuracy and efficiency. In simulations on edge devices, the
inference speed reaches 14.8 FPS, further demonstrating the method's
applicability for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于时空频率运动感知的视频伪装目标检测方法Vcamba，结合频率和空间特征以提高检测效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖空间外观特征，但由于前景与背景高度相似，空间特征的区分性有限，影响检测效果。频率特征和Mamba模型的长序列建模能力为解决这一问题提供了新思路。

Method: 提出RFVSS模块提取多尺度空间特征，AFE模块增强频率学习，SLMP和FLMP模块分别建模时空和频率时序序列，SFMF模块融合双域特征。

Result: Vcamba在6个评估指标和2个数据集上优于现有方法，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: Vcamba通过结合频率和空间特征，显著提升了视频伪装目标检测的性能和效率。

Abstract: Existing video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) methods primarily rely on
spatial appearance features to perceive motion cues for breaking camouflage.
However, the high similarity between foreground and background in VCOD results
in limited discriminability of spatial appearance features (e.g., color and
texture), restricting detection accuracy and completeness. Recent studies
demonstrate that frequency features can not only enhance feature representation
to compensate for appearance limitations but also perceive motion through
dynamic variations in frequency energy. Furthermore, the emerging state space
model called Mamba, enables efficient perception of motion cues in frame
sequences due to its linear-time long-sequence modeling capability. Motivated
by this, we propose a novel visual camouflage Mamba (Vcamba) based on
spatio-frequency motion perception that integrates frequency and spatial
features for efficient and accurate VCOD. Specifically, we propose a receptive
field visual state space (RFVSS) module to extract multi-scale spatial features
after sequence modeling. For frequency learning, we introduce an adaptive
frequency component enhancement (AFE) module with a novel frequency-domain
sequential scanning strategy to maintain semantic consistency. Then we propose
a space-based long-range motion perception (SLMP) module and a frequency-based
long-range motion perception (FLMP) module to model spatio-temporal and
frequency-temporal sequences in spatial and frequency phase domains. Finally,
the space and frequency motion fusion module (SFMF) integrates dual-domain
features for unified motion representation. Experimental results show that our
Vcamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods across 6 evaluation metrics on 2
datasets with lower computation cost, confirming the superiority of Vcamba. Our
code is available at: https://github.com/BoydeLi/Vcamba.

TL;DR: MIDI-B Challenge旨在标准化DICOM图像去标识化工具的基准测试，基于HIPAA Safe Harbor法规和DICOM属性保密配置文件，同时保留研究关键元数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保医疗图像共享时保护患者隐私（PHI/PII），同时保留非PHI元数据以支持AI研究。

Method: 挑战分为训练、验证和测试三个阶段，使用含合成PHI/PII的多中心、多模态DICOM图像数据集。

Result: 十支团队完成测试，去标识化准确率在97.91%至99.93%之间。

Conclusion: MIDI-B挑战为图像去标识化提供了标准化平台，展示了规则方法的有效性。

Abstract: The de-identification (deID) of protected health information (PHI) and
personally identifiable information (PII) is a fundamental requirement for
sharing medical images, particularly through public repositories, to ensure
compliance with patient privacy laws. In addition, preservation of non-PHI
metadata to inform and enable downstream development of imaging artificial
intelligence (AI) is an important consideration in biomedical research. The
goal of MIDI-B was to provide a standardized platform for benchmarking of DICOM
image deID tools based on a set of rules conformant to the HIPAA Safe Harbor
regulation, the DICOM Attribute Confidentiality Profiles, and best practices in
preservation of research-critical metadata, as defined by The Cancer Imaging
Archive (TCIA). The challenge employed a large, diverse, multi-center, and
multi-modality set of real de-identified radiology images with synthetic
PHI/PII inserted.
  The MIDI-B Challenge consisted of three phases: training, validation, and
test. Eighty individuals registered for the challenge. In the training phase,
we encouraged participants to tune their algorithms using their in-house or
public data. The validation and test phases utilized the DICOM images
containing synthetic identifiers (of 216 and 322 subjects, respectively). Ten
teams successfully completed the test phase of the challenge. To measure
success of a rule-based approach to image deID, scores were computed as the
percentage of correct actions from the total number of required actions. The
scores ranged from 97.91% to 99.93%. Participants employed a variety of
open-source and proprietary tools with customized configurations, large
language models, and optical character recognition (OCR). In this paper we
provide a comprehensive report on the MIDI-B Challenge's design,
implementation, results, and lessons learned.

TL;DR: DivControl提出了一种可分解的预训练框架，通过SVD分解ControlNet，实现统一可控生成和高效适应，显著降低训练成本并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在图像到图像生成中要么需要为每个条件训练单独模型，要么依赖纠缠表示的统一架构，导致泛化能力差和适应成本高。

Method: DivControl通过SVD分解ControlNet为基本组件，利用知识转移和动态门实现条件无关和条件特定的解耦，并通过表示对齐损失提升条件保真度。

Result: DivControl在可控性上达到SOTA，训练成本降低36.4倍，同时在基础条件和未见条件上表现出色。

Conclusion: DivControl展示了卓越的可扩展性、模块化和迁移能力，为可控生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced from text-to-image (T2I) to image-to-image
(I2I) generation by incorporating structured inputs such as depth maps,
enabling fine-grained spatial control. However, existing methods either train
separate models for each condition or rely on unified architectures with
entangled representations, resulting in poor generalization and high adaptation
costs for novel conditions. To this end, we propose DivControl, a decomposable
pretraining framework for unified controllable generation and efficient
adaptation. DivControl factorizes ControlNet via SVD into basic
components-pairs of singular vectors-which are disentangled into
condition-agnostic learngenes and condition-specific tailors through knowledge
diversion during multi-condition training. Knowledge diversion is implemented
via a dynamic gate that performs soft routing over tailors based on the
semantics of condition instructions, enabling zero-shot generalization and
parameter-efficient adaptation to novel conditions. To further improve
condition fidelity and training efficiency, we introduce a representation
alignment loss that aligns condition embeddings with early diffusion features.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DivControl achieves state-of-the-art
controllability with 36.4$\times$ less training cost, while simultaneously
improving average performance on basic conditions. It also delivers strong
zero-shot and few-shot performance on unseen conditions, demonstrating superior
scalability, modularity, and transferability.

Result: EMAT在PASCAL-5$^i$和COCO-20$^i$数据集上表现优于所有现有方法，且参数数量减少四倍。

Conclusion: EMAT显著提升了少样本分类和分割的性能，同时提出了更实用的评估设置。

Abstract: Few-shot classification and segmentation (FS-CS) focuses on jointly
performing multi-label classification and multi-class segmentation using few
annotated examples. Although the current state of the art (SOTA) achieves high
accuracy in both tasks, it struggles with small objects. To overcome this, we
propose the Efficient Masked Attention Transformer (EMAT), which improves
classification and segmentation accuracy, especially for small objects. EMAT
introduces three modifications: a novel memory-efficient masked attention
mechanism, a learnable downscaling strategy, and parameter-efficiency
enhancements. EMAT outperforms all FS-CS methods on the PASCAL-5$^i$ and
COCO-20$^i$ datasets, using at least four times fewer trainable parameters.
Moreover, as the current FS-CS evaluation setting discards available
annotations, despite their costly collection, we introduce two novel evaluation
settings that consider these annotations to better reflect practical scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了计算复杂度和资源消耗，为SNNs的高效训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically plausible framework for
energy-efficient neuromorphic computing. However, it is a challenge to train
SNNs due to their non-differentiability, efficiently. Existing gradient
approximation approaches frequently sacrifice accuracy and face deployment
limitations on edge devices due to the substantial computational requirements
of backpropagation. To address these challenges, we propose a Forward-Forward
(FF) based gradient approximation-free training framework for Spiking Neural
Networks, which treats spiking activations as black-box modules, thereby
eliminating the need for gradient approximation while significantly reducing
computational complexity. Furthermore, we introduce a class-aware complexity
adaptation mechanism that dynamically optimizes the loss function based on
inter-class difficulty metrics, enabling efficient allocation of network
resources across different categories. Experimental results demonstrate that
our proposed training framework achieves test accuracies of 99.58%, 92.13%, and
75.64% on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively,
surpassing all existing FF-based SNN approaches. Additionally, our proposed
method exhibits significant advantages in terms of memory access and
computational power consumption.

Abstract: Medical image annotation is constrained by privacy concerns and
labor-intensive labeling, significantly limiting the performance and
generalization of segmentation models. While mask-controllable diffusion models
excel in synthesis, they struggle with precise lesion-mask alignment. We
propose \textbf{Adaptively Distilled ControlNet}, a task-agnostic framework
that accelerates training and optimization through dual-model distillation.
Specifically, during training, a teacher model, conditioned on mask-image
pairs, regularizes a mask-only student model via predicted noise alignment in
parameter space, further enhanced by adaptive regularization based on
lesion-background ratios. During sampling, only the student model is used,
enabling privacy-preserving medical image generation. Comprehensive evaluations
on two distinct medical datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance:
TransUNet improves mDice/mIoU by 2.4%/4.2% on KiTS19, while SANet achieves
2.6%/3.5% gains on Polyps, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority. Code

Method: 提出了一种显式条件化时间元数据的机制，并基于此开发了OmniTraj模型，在大规模异构数据集上预训练。

Result: OmniTraj在零样本迁移中减少了70%以上的预测误差，并在微调后在多个数据集上达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: 显式条件化时间元数据是解决时间动态数据集迁移问题的有效方法，OmniTraj展示了其优越性。

Abstract: While large-scale pre-training has advanced human trajectory prediction, a
critical challenge remains: zero-shot transfer to unseen dataset with varying
temporal dynamics. State-of-the-art pre-trained models often require
fine-tuning to adapt to new datasets with different frame rates or observation
horizons, limiting their scalability and practical utility. In this work, we
systematically investigate this limitation and propose a robust solution. We
first demonstrate that existing data-aware discrete models struggle when
transferred to new scenarios with shifted temporal setups. We then isolate the
temporal generalization from dataset shift, revealing that a simple, explicit
conditioning mechanism for temporal metadata is a highly effective solution.
Based on this insight, we present OmniTraj, a Transformer-based model
pre-trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous dataset. Our experiments show that
explicitly conditioning on the frame rate enables OmniTraj to achieve
state-of-the-art zero-shot transfer performance, reducing prediction error by
over 70\% in challenging cross-setup scenarios. After fine-tuning, OmniTraj
achieves state-of-the-art results on four datasets, including NBA, JTA,
WorldPose, and ETH-UCY. The code is publicly available:

Conclusion: I2V-GS是首个实现基础设施-车辆视图转换的框架，为自动驾驶数据生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Vast and high-quality data are essential for end-to-end autonomous driving
systems. However, current driving data is mainly collected by vehicles, which
is expensive and inefficient. A potential solution lies in synthesizing data
from real-world images. Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction demonstrate
photorealistic novel view synthesis, highlighting the potential of generating
driving data from images captured on the road. This paper introduces a novel
method, I2V-GS, to transfer the Infrastructure view To the Vehicle view with
Gaussian Splatting. Reconstruction from sparse infrastructure viewpoints and
rendering under large view transformations is a challenging problem. We adopt
the adaptive depth warp to generate dense training views. To further expand the
range of views, we employ a cascade strategy to inpaint warped images, which
also ensures inpainting content is consistent across views. To further ensure
the reliability of the diffusion model, we utilize the cross-view information
to perform a confidenceguided optimization. Moreover, we introduce RoadSight, a
multi-modality, multi-view dataset from real scenarios in infrastructure views.
To our knowledge, I2V-GS is the first framework to generate autonomous driving
datasets with infrastructure-vehicle view transformation. Experimental results
demonstrate that I2V-GS significantly improves synthesis quality under vehicle
view, outperforming StreetGaussian in NTA-Iou, NTL-Iou, and FID by 45.7%,

Motivation: 高保真3D视频重建对VR/AR至关重要，但现有方法在复杂运动和尺度变化下表现不佳，导致视觉质量下降。

Method: 提出FlowGaussian-VR，包含速度场渲染管道（VFR）和流辅助自适应密集化策略（FAD），优化动态内容重建。

Conclusion: FlowGaussian-VR显著提升了动态场景重建的视觉质量，为复杂运动场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D video reconstruction is essential for enabling real-time
rendering of dynamic scenes with realistic motion in virtual and augmented
reality (VR/AR). The deformation field paradigm of 3D Gaussian splatting has
achieved near-photorealistic results in video reconstruction due to the great
representation capability of deep deformation networks. However, in videos with
complex motion and significant scale variations, deformation networks often
overfit to irregular Gaussian trajectories, leading to suboptimal visual
quality. Moreover, the gradient-based densification strategy designed for
static scene reconstruction proves inadequate to address the absence of dynamic
content. In light of these challenges, we propose a flow-empowered velocity
field modeling scheme tailored for Gaussian video reconstruction, dubbed
FlowGaussian-VR. It consists of two core components: a velocity field rendering
(VFR) pipeline which enables optical flow-based optimization, and a
flow-assisted adaptive densification (FAD) strategy that adjusts the number and
size of Gaussians in dynamic regions. We validate our model's effectiveness on
multi-view dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis with multiple
real-world datasets containing challenging motion scenarios, demonstrating not
only notable visual improvements (over 2.5 dB gain in PSNR) and less blurry
artifacts in dynamic textures, but also regularized and trackable per-Gaussian
trajectories.

bird classes and 45 concepts to generate images which substitute a specific
concept, such as wing color or belly pattern. We introduce a novel Tied
Diffusion Guidance (TDG) method to precisely control generated images, where
noise sharing for two parallel denoising processes ensures that both the

Abstract: The deployment of Machine Learning models intraoperatively for tissue
characterisation can assist decision making and guide safe tumour resections.
For image classification models, pixel attribution methods are popular to infer
explainability. However, overconfidence in deep learning model's predictions
translates to overconfidence in pixel attribution. In this paper, we propose
the first approach which incorporates risk estimation into a pixel attribution
method for improved image classification explainability. The proposed method
iteratively applies a classification model with a pixel attribution method to
create a volume of PA maps. This volume is used for the first time, to generate
a pixel-wise distribution of PA values. We introduce a method to generate an
enhanced PA map by estimating the expectation values of the pixel-wise
distributions. In addition, the coefficient of variation (CV) is used to
estimate pixel-wise risk of this enhanced PA map. Hence, the proposed method
not only provides an improved PA map but also produces an estimation of risk on
the output PA values. Performance evaluation on probe-based Confocal Laser
Endomicroscopy (pCLE) data and ImageNet verifies that our improved
explainability method outperforms the state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: 数据驱动的谱域生成模型可以完全替代传统公理模型，提升函数映射的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Deep functional maps have recently emerged as a powerful tool for solving
non-rigid shape correspondence tasks. Methods that use this approach combine
the power and flexibility of the functional map framework, with data-driven
learning for improved accuracy and generality. However, most existing methods
in this area restrict the learning aspect only to the feature functions and
still rely on axiomatic modeling for formulating the training loss or for
functional map regularization inside the networks. This limits both the
accuracy and the applicability of the resulting approaches only to scenarios
where assumptions of the axiomatic models hold. In this work, we show, for the
first time, that both in-network regularization and functional map training can
be replaced with data-driven methods. For this, we first train a generative
model of functional maps in the spectral domain using score-based generative
modeling, built from a large collection of high-quality maps. We then exploit
the resulting model to promote the structural properties of ground truth
functional maps on new shape collections. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the
learned models are category-agnostic, and can fully replace commonly used
strategies such as enforcing Laplacian commutativity or orthogonality of
functional maps. Our key technical contribution is a novel distillation
strategy from diffusion models in the spectral domain. Experiments demonstrate
that our learned regularization leads to better results than axiomatic
approaches for zero-shot non-rigid shape matching. Our code is available at:

Result: 在affordance分割基准和真实机器人任务中表现出强大的开放世界泛化能力。

Conclusion: RAGNet和AffordanceNet为开放世界抓取任务提供了有效的数据和框架支持。

Abstract: General robotic grasping systems require accurate object affordance
perception in diverse open-world scenarios following human instructions.
However, current studies suffer from the problem of lacking reasoning-based
large-scale affordance prediction data, leading to considerable concern about
open-world effectiveness. To address this limitation, we build a large-scale
grasping-oriented affordance segmentation benchmark with human-like
instructions, named RAGNet. It contains 273k images, 180 categories, and 26k
reasoning instructions. The images cover diverse embodied data domains, such as
wild, robot, ego-centric, and even simulation data. They are carefully
annotated with an affordance map, while the difficulty of language instructions
is largely increased by removing their category name and only providing
functional descriptions. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive
affordance-based grasping framework, named AffordanceNet, which consists of a
VLM pre-trained on our massive affordance data and a grasping network that
conditions an affordance map to grasp the target. Extensive experiments on
affordance segmentation benchmarks and real-robot manipulation tasks show that
our model has a powerful open-world generalization ability. Our data and code
is available at https://github.com/wudongming97/AffordanceNet.

TL;DR: DIAS通过重新初始化和自蒸馏改进Slot Attention，减少冗余并提升对象表示效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Slot Attention中冗余槽竞争和信息监督不足的问题。

Method: 引入重新初始化和自蒸馏机制，优化槽的更新和注意力图。

Result: 在对象发现和识别等任务上达到SOTA，提升视觉预测和推理能力。

Conclusion: DIAS有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了OCL任务的性能。

Abstract: Unlike popular solutions based on dense feature maps, Object-Centric Learning
(OCL) represents visual scenes as sub-symbolic object-level feature vectors,
termed slots, which are highly versatile for tasks involving visual modalities.
OCL typically aggregates object superpixels into slots by iteratively applying
competitive cross attention, known as Slot Attention, with the slots as the
query. However, once initialized, these slots are reused naively, causing
redundant slots to compete with informative ones for representing objects. This
often results in objects being erroneously segmented into parts. Additionally,
mainstream methods derive supervision signals solely from decoding slots into
the input's reconstruction, overlooking potential supervision based on internal
information. To address these issues, we propose Slot Attention with
re-Initialization and self-Distillation (DIAS): $\emph{i)}$ We reduce
redundancy in the aggregated slots and re-initialize extra aggregation to
update the remaining slots; $\emph{ii)}$ We drive the bad attention map at the
first aggregation iteration to approximate the good at the last iteration to
enable self-distillation. Experiments demonstrate that DIAS achieves
state-of-the-art on OCL tasks like object discovery and recognition, while also
improving advanced visual prediction and reasoning. Our code is available on

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Phi-Ground模型家族，通过实证研究改进了GUI接地模型的训练，在多个基准测试中取得了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前端到端接地模型在复杂基准测试中的准确率不足65%，无法满足实际部署需求，亟需改进。

Method: 从数据收集到模型训练进行详细研究，开发了Phi-Ground模型家族。

Result: Phi-Ground在五个接地基准测试中表现最佳，在ScreenSpot-pro和UI-Vision上分别达到43.2和27.2分。

Conclusion: 本文的研究不仅改进了接地模型，还为其他感知任务提供了借鉴。

Abstract: With the development of multimodal reasoning models, Computer Use Agents
(CUAs), akin to Jarvis from \textit{"Iron Man"}, are becoming a reality. GUI
grounding is a core component for CUAs to execute actual actions, similar to
mechanical control in robotics, and it directly leads to the success or failure
of the system. It determines actions such as clicking and typing, as well as
related parameters like the coordinates for clicks. Current end-to-end
grounding models still achieve less than 65\% accuracy on challenging
benchmarks like ScreenSpot-pro and UI-Vision, indicating they are far from
being ready for deployment. % , as a single misclick can result in unacceptable
consequences. In this work, we conduct an empirical study on the training of
grounding models, examining details from data collection to model training.
Ultimately, we developed the \textbf{Phi-Ground} model family, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all five grounding benchmarks for models
under $10B$ parameters in agent settings. In the end-to-end model setting, our
model still achieves SOTA results with scores of \textit{\textbf{43.2}} on
ScreenSpot-pro and \textit{\textbf{27.2}} on UI-Vision. We believe that the
various details discussed in this paper, along with our successes and failures,
not only clarify the construction of grounding models but also benefit other
perception tasks. Project homepage:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于3D高斯溅射（3DGS）的方法仅限于单对象、单步交互，无法满足复杂现实任务的需求。

Method: 提出了SeqSplatNet框架，结合大语言模型和条件解码器，生成3D功能区域掩码；引入预训练策略和特征注入机制以处理复杂几何和语义模糊。

Result: 在SeqAffordSplat基准上，SeqSplatNet达到了新的最优性能，实现了从单步交互到复杂场景级任务的提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有效推动了3D功能区域推理从单步到复杂序列任务的发展。

Abstract: 3D affordance reasoning, the task of associating human instructions with the
functional regions of 3D objects, is a critical capability for embodied agents.
Current methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are fundamentally limited
to single-object, single-step interactions, a paradigm that falls short of
addressing the long-horizon, multi-object tasks required for complex real-world
applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce the novel task of Sequential 3D
Gaussian Affordance Reasoning and establish SeqAffordSplat, a large-scale
benchmark featuring 1800+ scenes to support research on long-horizon affordance
understanding in complex 3DGS environments. We then propose SeqSplatNet, an
end-to-end framework that directly maps an instruction to a sequence of 3D
affordance masks. SeqSplatNet employs a large language model that
autoregressively generates text interleaved with special segmentation tokens,
guiding a conditional decoder to produce the corresponding 3D mask. To handle
complex scene geometry, we introduce a pre-training strategy, Conditional
Geometric Reconstruction, where the model learns to reconstruct complete
affordance region masks from known geometric observations, thereby building a
robust geometric prior. Furthermore, to resolve semantic ambiguities, we design
a feature injection mechanism that lifts rich semantic features from 2D Vision
Foundation Models (VFM) and fuses them into the 3D decoder at multiple scales.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets a new state-of-the-art
on our challenging benchmark, effectively advancing affordance reasoning from
single-step interactions to complex, sequential tasks at the scene level.

TL;DR: 提出了一种将SMPL-X模型嵌入动态物理交互的方法，通过“半物理”机制实现实时、无学习的物理交互，避免穿透和不真实的物体动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人体模型（如SMPL-X）因运动学特性无法与环境物理交互，导致穿透和不真实的物体动态问题。

Method: 提出“半物理”机制，将运动学动作转化为物理模拟，保持对SMPL-X姿态的运动学控制，同时实现物理交互。

Result: 方法无需学习，实时运行，适用于任意体型和动作，且保持原始运动学动作的保真度。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了运动学模型的物理交互问题，为3D人体模型的实际应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: While current general-purpose 3D human models (e.g., SMPL-X) efficiently
represent accurate human shape and pose, they lacks the ability to physically
interact with the environment due to the kinematic nature. As a result,
kinematic-based interaction models often suffer from issues such as
interpenetration and unrealistic object dynamics. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel approach that embeds SMPL-X into a tangible entity capable
of dynamic physical interactions with its surroundings. Specifically, we
propose a "half-physics" mechanism that transforms 3D kinematic motion into a
physics simulation. Our approach maintains kinematic control over inherent
SMPL-X poses while ensuring physically plausible interactions with scenes and
objects, effectively eliminating penetration and unrealistic object dynamics.
Unlike reinforcement learning-based methods, which demand extensive and complex
training, our half-physics method is learning-free and generalizes to any body
shape and motion; meanwhile, it operates in real time. Moreover, it preserves
the fidelity of the original kinematic motion while seamlessly integrating
physical interactions

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从稀疏视角视频中重建动态场景的方法，解决了传统多视角重建方法在稀疏视角下效果不佳的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态场景重建需要密集多视角摄像头（如Panoptic Studio），成本高且难以在野外场景中应用。本文旨在从少量稀疏视角摄像头（如四个静态摄像头）重建动态人类行为。

Method: 通过独立单目重建每个摄像头的视角，并精心对齐这些重建结果，生成时间和视角一致的动态场景重建。

Result: 在PanopticStudio和Ego-Exo4D数据集上的实验表明，该方法在渲染新视角时优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法在稀疏视角下实现了高质量的动态场景重建，为实际应用提供了更经济的解决方案。

Abstract: We address the problem of dynamic scene reconstruction from sparse-view
videos. Prior work often requires dense multi-view captures with hundreds of
calibrated cameras (e.g. Panoptic Studio). Such multi-view setups are
prohibitively expensive to build and cannot capture diverse scenes in-the-wild.
In contrast, we aim to reconstruct dynamic human behaviors, such as repairing a
bike or dancing, from a small set of sparse-view cameras with complete scene
coverage (e.g. four equidistant inward-facing static cameras). We find that
dense multi-view reconstruction methods struggle to adapt to this sparse-view
setup due to limited overlap between viewpoints. To address these limitations,
we carefully align independent monocular reconstructions of each camera to
produce time- and view-consistent dynamic scene reconstructions. Extensive
experiments on PanopticStudio and Ego-Exo4D demonstrate that our method
achieves higher quality reconstructions than prior art, particularly when
rendering novel views. Code, data, and data-processing scripts are available on
https://github.com/ImNotPrepared/MonoFusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据构建成本高和3D形状、外观与运动联合表示的高维性，直接4D扩散建模极具挑战性。

Method: 引入Direct 4DMesh-to-GS Variation Field VAE，直接编码高斯溅射及其时间变化，并训练高斯变化场扩散模型。

Result: 模型在Objaverse数据集上表现出优于现有方法的生成质量，并能泛化到真实视频输入。

Conclusion: 该框架为生成高质量动态3D内容提供了新途径。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for video-to-4D generation that
creates high-quality dynamic 3D content from single video inputs. Direct 4D
diffusion modeling is extremely challenging due to costly data construction and
the high-dimensional nature of jointly representing 3D shape, appearance, and
motion. We address these challenges by introducing a Direct 4DMesh-to-GS
Variation Field VAE that directly encodes canonical Gaussian Splats (GS) and
their temporal variations from 3D animation data without per-instance fitting,
and compresses high-dimensional animations into a compact latent space.
Building upon this efficient representation, we train a Gaussian Variation
Field diffusion model with temporal-aware Diffusion Transformer conditioned on
input videos and canonical GS. Trained on carefully-curated animatable 3D
objects from the Objaverse dataset, our model demonstrates superior generation
quality compared to existing methods. It also exhibits remarkable
generalization to in-the-wild video inputs despite being trained exclusively on
synthetic data, paving the way for generating high-quality animated 3D content.

Motivation: 在线房产预订平台依赖第三方数据，但数据常不完整或不一致，影响用户体验和市场表现。

Method: 评估了Mistral 7B（QLoRA微调）和Mixtral 8x7B（优化系统提示）在生成一致描述和减少幻觉方面的表现。

Result: Mixtral 8x7B在完整性（99.6% vs. 93%）、精确度（98.8% vs. 96%）和幻觉率（1.2% vs. 4%）上优于Mistral 7B，但计算成本更高（50GB VRAM vs. 5GB）。

Conclusion: 研究为LLMs在生产环境中的部署提供了质量与资源效率的权衡指导，证明了其在提升数据一致性和可靠性方面的有效性。

Abstract: Online property booking platforms are widely used and rely heavily on
consistent, up-to-date information about accommodation facilities, often
sourced from third-party providers. However, these external data sources are
frequently affected by incomplete or inconsistent details, which can frustrate
users and result in a loss of market. In response to these challenges, we
present an industrial case study involving the integration of Large Language
Models (LLMs) into CALEIDOHOTELS, a property reservation platform developed by
FERVENTO. We evaluate two well-known LLMs in this context: Mistral 7B,
fine-tuned with QLoRA, and Mixtral 8x7B, utilized with a refined system prompt.
Both models were assessed based on their ability to generate consistent and
homogeneous descriptions while minimizing hallucinations. Mixtral 8x7B
outperformed Mistral 7B in terms of completeness (99.6% vs. 93%), precision
(98.8% vs. 96%), and hallucination rate (1.2% vs. 4%), producing shorter yet
more concise content (249 vs. 277 words on average). However, this came at a
significantly higher computational cost: 50GB VRAM and $1.61/hour versus 5GB
and $0.16/hour for Mistral 7B. Our findings provide practical insights into the
trade-offs between model quality and resource efficiency, offering guidance for
deploying LLMs in production environments and demonstrating their effectiveness
in enhancing the consistency and reliability of accommodation data.

Motivation: 当前电力营销客服系统（如中国95598热线）存在响应慢、流程僵化等问题，通用大模型缺乏领域专业性和同理心，需填补这一空白。

Method: 提出ElectriQ基准，包含六类服务对话数据集和四项评估指标（专业性、受欢迎度、可读性、用户友好性），结合领域知识库和知识增强方法。

Result: 实验表明，优化后的小模型（如LLama3-8B）在专业性和用户友好性上超越GPT-4o。

Conclusion: ElectriQ为电力营销服务的定制化大模型开发提供了全面基础。

Abstract: Electric power marketing customer service plays a critical role in addressing
inquiries, complaints, and service requests. However, current systems, such as
China's 95598 hotline, often struggle with slow response times, inflexible
procedures, and limited accuracy in domain-specific tasks. While large language
models (LLMs) like GPT-4o and Claude 3 demonstrate strong general capabilities,
they lack the domain expertise and empathy required in this field. To bridge
this gap, we introduce ElectriQ, the first benchmark designed to evaluate and
enhance LLMs in electric power marketing scenarios. ElectriQ consists of a
dialogue dataset covering six key service categories and introduces four
evaluation metrics: professionalism, popularity, readability, and
user-friendliness. We further incorporate a domain-specific knowledge base and
propose a knowledge augmentation method to boost model performance. Experiments
on 13 LLMs reveal that smaller models such as LLama3-8B, when fine-tuned and
augmented, can surpass GPT-4o in terms of professionalism and
user-friendliness. ElectriQ establishes a comprehensive foundation for
developing LLMs tailored to the needs of power marketing services.

Abstract: Illegal marketplaces have increasingly shifted to concealed parts of the
internet, including the deep and dark web, as well as platforms such as
Telegram, Reddit, and Pastebin. These channels enable the anonymous trade of
illicit goods including drugs, weapons, and stolen credentials. Detecting and
categorizing such content remains challenging due to limited labeled data, the
evolving nature of illicit language, and the structural heterogeneity of online
sources. This paper presents a hierarchical classification framework that
combines fine-tuned language models with a semi-supervised ensemble learning
strategy to detect and classify illicit marketplace content across diverse
platforms. We extract semantic representations using ModernBERT, a transformer
model for long documents, finetuned on domain-specific data from deep and dark
web pages, Telegram channels, Subreddits, and Pastebin pastes to capture
specialized jargon and ambiguous linguistic patterns. In addition, we
incorporate manually engineered features such as document structure, embedded
patterns including Bitcoin addresses, emails, and IPs, and metadata, which
complement language model embeddings. The classification pipeline operates in
two stages. The first stage uses a semi-supervised ensemble of XGBoost, Random
Forest, and SVM with entropy-based weighted voting to detect sales-related
documents. The second stage further classifies these into drug, weapon, or
credential sales. Experiments on three datasets, including our multi-source
corpus, DUTA, and CoDA, show that our model outperforms several baselines,
including BERT, ModernBERT, DarkBERT, ALBERT, Longformer, and BigBird. The
model achieves an accuracy of 0.96489, an F1-score of 0.93467, and a TMCC of
0.95388, demonstrating strong generalization, robustness under limited
supervision, and effectiveness in real-world illicit content detection.

Conclusion: 混合框架结合了机器学习的精确性和LLM的生成能力，显著提升了主题分析的准确性和可控性。

Abstract: Providing subject access to information resources is an essential function of
any library management system. Large language models (LLMs) have been widely
used in classification and summarization tasks, but their capability to perform
subject analysis is underexplored. Multi-label classification with traditional
machine learning (ML) models has been used for subject analysis but struggles
with unseen cases. LLMs offer an alternative but often over-generate and
hallucinate. Therefore, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates
embedding-based ML models with LLMs. This approach uses ML models to (1)
predict the optimal number of LCSH labels to guide LLM predictions and (2)
post-edit the predicted terms with actual LCSH terms to mitigate
hallucinations. We experimented with LLMs and the hybrid framework to predict
the subject terms of books using the Library of Congress Subject Headings
(LCSH). Experiment results show that providing initial predictions to guide LLM
generations and imposing post-edits result in more controlled and
vocabulary-aligned outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱集成方法在上下文匹配方面研究不足，尤其是在处理来源、规模和信息密度差异大的真实KG时表现不佳。

Result: 在OAEI竞赛中表现优异，优于监督方法，并在多样测试案例中实现高准确率。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了复杂上下文匹配问题，并通过新数据集验证了三重匹配的全面性。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful tools for representing and reasoning over
structured information. Their main components include schema, identity, and
context. While schema and identity matching are well-established in ontology
and entity matching research, context matching remains largely unexplored. This
is particularly important because real-world KGs often vary significantly in
source, size, and information density - factors not typically represented in
the datasets on which current entity matching methods are evaluated. As a
result, existing approaches may fall short in scenarios where diverse and
complex contexts need to be integrated.
  To address this gap, we propose a novel KG integration method consisting of
label matching and triple matching. We use string manipulation, fuzzy matching,
and vector similarity techniques to align entity and predicate labels. Next, we
identify mappings between triples that convey comparable information, using
these mappings to improve entity-matching accuracy. Our approach demonstrates
competitive performance compared to leading systems in the OAEI competition and
against supervised methods, achieving high accuracy across diverse test cases.
Additionally, we introduce a new dataset derived from the benchmark dataset to
evaluate the triple-matching step more comprehensively.

Abstract: Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the generation of
content that is not faithful to the input or the real-world facts. This paper
provides a rigorous treatment of hallucination in LLMs, including formal
definitions and theoretical analyses. We distinguish between intrinsic and
extrinsic hallucinations, and define a \textit{hallucination risk} for models.
We derive bounds on this risk using learning-theoretic frameworks (PAC-Bayes
and Rademacher complexity). We then survey detection strategies for
hallucinations, such as token-level uncertainty estimation, confidence
calibration, and attention alignment checks. On the mitigation side, we discuss
approaches including retrieval-augmented generation, hallucination-aware
fine-tuning, logit calibration, and the incorporation of fact-verification
modules. We propose a unified detection and mitigation workflow, illustrated
with a diagram, to integrate these strategies. Finally, we outline evaluation
protocols for hallucination, recommending datasets, metrics, and experimental
setups to quantify and reduce hallucinations. Our work lays a theoretical
foundation and practical guidelines for addressing the crucial challenge of
hallucination in LLMs.

*Kwun Hang Lau,Ruiyuan Zhang,Weijie Shi,Xiaofang Zhou,Xiaojun Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的RAG框架，通过引入时间逻辑处理纵向查询，显著提升了答案准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG在处理需要跨时间追踪实体和现象的查询时表现不足，缺乏时间连贯性。

Method: 提出新框架，将查询分解为主题和时间窗口，使用专用检索器结合语义匹配和时间相关性。

Result: 在ADQAB基准测试中，答案准确率比标准RAG高13%至27%。

Conclusion: 该研究为RAG系统提供了处理复杂现实问题的新方法，数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) excels at injecting static,
factual knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs), it exhibits a critical
deficit in handling longitudinal queries that require tracking entities and
phenomena across time. This blind spot arises because conventional,
semantically-driven retrieval methods are not equipped to gather evidence that
is both topically relevant and temporally coherent for a specified duration. We
address this challenge by proposing a new framework that fundamentally
redesigns the RAG pipeline to infuse temporal logic. Our methodology begins by
disentangling a user's query into its core subject and its temporal window. It
then employs a specialized retriever that calibrates semantic matching against
temporal relevance, ensuring the collection of a contiguous evidence set that
spans the entire queried period. To enable rigorous evaluation of this
capability, we also introduce the Analytical Diachronic Question Answering
Benchmark (ADQAB), a challenging evaluation suite grounded in a hybrid corpus
of real and synthetic financial news. Empirical results on ADQAB show that our
approach yields substantial gains in answer accuracy, surpassing standard RAG
implementations by 13% to 27%. This work provides a validated pathway toward
RAG systems capable of performing the nuanced, evolutionary analysis required
for complex, real-world questions. The dataset and code for this study are
publicly available at https://github.com/kwunhang/TA-RAG.

TL;DR: 研究了Gemma-2语言模型（不同规模）的内部概念是否一致，发现中间层特征相似性最高，支持跨模型可解释性的普遍性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究不同规模的语言模型是否收敛到相似的内部概念，以验证特征普遍性作为跨模型可解释性的基础。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAE）提取残差流激活，通过激活相关性对齐特征，并用SVCCA和RSA比较特征空间。

Result: 中间层特征重叠最强，早期和晚期层相似性较低；多令牌子空间分析显示语义相似的子空间与模型交互方式一致。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在不同规模下仍能形成相似的可解释特征，支持特征普遍性作为跨模型可解释性的基础。

Abstract: We investigate feature universality in Gemma-2 language models (Gemma-2-2B
and Gemma-2-9B), asking whether models with a four-fold difference in scale
still converge on comparable internal concepts. Using the Sparse Autoencoder
(SAE) dictionary-learning pipeline, we utilize SAEs on each model's
residual-stream activations, align the resulting monosemantic features via
activation correlation, and compare the matched feature spaces with SVCCA and
RSA. Middle layers yield the strongest overlap, while early and late layers
show far less similarity. Preliminary experiments extend the analysis from
single tokens to multi-token subspaces, showing that semantically similar
subspaces interact similarly with language models. These results strengthen the
case that large language models carve the world into broadly similar,
interpretable features despite size differences, reinforcing universality as a
foundation for cross-model interpretability.

*Qixuan Hu,Xumou Zhang,Jinman Kim,Florence Bourgeois,Adam G. Dunn*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出两种预测模型，用于在临床试验前预测严重不良事件（SAE）结果，以优化试验设计并减少风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过准确预测SAE结果，避免试验终止并减少参与者风险。

Method: 使用预训练语言模型（如ClinicalT5、BioBERT）提取特征，结合滑动窗口方法处理长文本，开发分类和回归模型。

Result: 最佳模型（ClinicalT5+Transformer+MLP）在预测SAE比例时AUC为77.6%，RMSE为18.6%。滑动窗口方法显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 利用ClinicalTrials.gov数据预测SAE结果，可优化试验设计并发现预期与实际结果的差异。

Abstract: Objectives: With accurate estimates of expected safety results, clinical
trials could be designed to avoid terminations and limit exposing participants
to unnecessary risks. We evaluated methods for predicting serious adverse event
(SAE) results in clinical trials using information only from their
registrations prior to the trial. Material and Methods: We analysed 22,107
two-arm parallel interventional clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov with
structured summary results. Two prediction models were developed: a classifier
predicting will experimental arm have higher SAE rates (area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve; AUC) than control arm, and a regression model
to predict the proportion of SAEs in control arms (root mean squared error;
RMSE). A transfer learning approach using pretrained language models (e.g.,
ClinicalT5, BioBERT) was used for feature extraction, combined with downstream
model for prediction. To maintain semantic representation in long trial texts
exceeding localised language model input limits, a sliding window method was
developed for embedding extraction. Results: The best model
(ClinicalT5+Transformer+MLP) had 77.6% AUC predicting which trial arm has a
higher proportion of patients with SAEs. When predicting proportion of
participants experiencing SAE in the control arm, the same model achieved RMSE
of 18.6%. The sliding window approach consistently outperformed methods without
it. Across 12 classifiers, the average absolute AUC increase was 2.00%; across
12 regressors, the average absolute RMSE reduction was 1.58%. Discussion:
Summary results data available at ClinicalTrials.gov remains underutilised. The
potential to estimate results of trials before they start is an opportunity to
improve trial design and flag discrepancies between expected and reported
safety results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的快速发展，需要将连续多模态数据转化为适合语言处理的离散表示。然而，缺乏对向量量化技术在LLM中应用的全面调查。

Method: 提出了8种代表性VQ变体的结构化分类，分析了其算法原理、训练动态及与LLM管道的集成挑战。

Result: 总结了VQ技术在传统应用、单模态和多模态LLM系统中的表现，并指出了代码本崩溃、梯度估计不稳定等关键挑战。

Conclusion: 该调查为高效且通用的多模态系统开发提供了基础参考，并提出了动态量化、统一标记化框架等未来研究方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
need for effective mechanisms to transform continuous multimodal data into
discrete representations suitable for language-based processing. Discrete
tokenization, with vector quantization (VQ) as a central approach, offers both
computational efficiency and compatibility with LLM architectures. Despite its
growing importance, there is a lack of a comprehensive survey that
systematically examines VQ techniques in the context of LLM-based systems. This
work fills this gap by presenting the first structured taxonomy and analysis of
discrete tokenization methods designed for LLMs. We categorize 8 representative
VQ variants that span classical and modern paradigms and analyze their
algorithmic principles, training dynamics, and integration challenges with LLM
pipelines. Beyond algorithm-level investigation, we discuss existing research
in terms of classical applications without LLMs, LLM-based single-modality
systems, and LLM-based multimodal systems, highlighting how quantization
strategies influence alignment, reasoning, and generation performance. In
addition, we identify key challenges including codebook collapse, unstable
gradient estimation, and modality-specific encoding constraints. Finally, we
discuss emerging research directions such as dynamic and task-adaptive
quantization, unified tokenization frameworks, and biologically inspired
codebook learning. This survey bridges the gap between traditional vector
quantization and modern LLM applications, serving as a foundational reference
for the development of efficient and generalizable multimodal systems. A

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为语言模型链（LMC）的算法，通过多阶段级联的语言模型组合，显著提高了预测速度和准确性，同时减少了幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型成本高、易产生幻觉信息的问题，避免资源浪费。

Method: 提出LMC算法，通过验证模型响应是否存在于候选答案中，并将错误响应输入更慢但更准确的模型，直至所有预测正确。

Result: 在医疗文档中提取患者出生日期的实验中，LMC显著提升了速度和准确性，减少了幻觉。

Conclusion: LMC算法对知识提取领域有重要贡献，值得进一步研究。

Abstract: Language models can capture complex relationships in given text, but these
are notorious for being costly and for producing information that does not
exist (i.e., hallucinations). Furthermore, the resources invested into
producing this information would be wasted if it were incorrect. We address
these issues by proposing, implementing, and applying the Language Model Chain
(LMC) algorithm. In this, a language model's response to a given prompt about
given text is only correct if it exists in the collection of possible (i.e.,
candidate) answers, and text corresponding to incorrect responses is fed into a
more predictive (but slower) language model. This process is repeated for a
collection of language models, or until all predictions about the text are
correct. We used the LMC algorithm to extract patient dates of birth from
medical documents, and combining a collection of language models in a
multi-stage cascade significantly increased prediction speed and accuracy over
individual language models, while greatly reducing the number of corresponding
hallucinations. We believe that the novel LMC algorithm significantly
contributes to the knowledge extraction field, and that this should be explored
much further in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨社交媒体情绪（如Reddit的r/wallstreetbets）是否能有效预测股价变动。

Method: 使用两种现有文本情绪分析方法，并引入基于ChatGPT标注和微调的RoBERTa模型，结合相关性和因果性指标评估预测能力。

Result: 社交媒体情绪与股价相关性较弱，评论量和搜索趋势更具预测性。

Conclusion: 传统情绪分析可能无法完全捕捉市场驱动的在线讨论的复杂性。

Abstract: The surge of retail investor activity on social media, exemplified by the
2021 GameStop short squeeze, raised questions about the influence of online
sentiment on stock prices. This paper explores whether sentiment derived from
social media discussions can meaningfully predict stock market movements. We
focus on Reddit's r/wallstreetbets and analyze sentiment related to two
companies: GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment (AMC). To assess sentiment's
role, we employ two existing text-based sentiment analysis methods and
introduce a third, a ChatGPT-annotated and fine-tuned RoBERTa-based model
designed to better interpret the informal language and emojis prevalent in
social media discussions. We use correlation and causality metrics to determine
these models' predictive power. Surprisingly, our findings suggest that social
media sentiment has only a weak correlation with stock prices. At the same
time, simpler metrics, such as the volume of comments and Google search trends,
exhibit stronger predictive signals. These results highlight the complexity of
retail investor behavior and suggest that traditional sentiment analysis may
not fully capture the nuances of market-moving online discussions.

TL;DR: 论文研究了多语言检索增强生成（RAG）系统中提示翻译策略对分类任务的影响，发现优化策略可显著提升跨语言知识共享和任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在多语言能力上有所进步，但其在不同语言和任务中的表现差异显著。多语言RAG系统中，知识库通常从高资源语言共享到低资源语言，导致检索信息与上下文语言不一致，而提示翻译策略的影响尚不明确。

Method: 系统评估了多语言RAG增强LLMs中不同提示翻译策略对分类任务的影响。

Result: 实验结果表明，优化的提示策略能显著提升跨语言知识共享，从而改善下游分类任务的性能。

Conclusion: 研究主张更广泛地利用多语言资源共享和跨语言提示优化，尤其是针对低资源语言。

Abstract: Despite advances in the multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), their performance varies substantially across different languages and
tasks. In multilingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based systems,
knowledge bases (KB) are often shared from high-resource languages (such as
English) to low-resource ones, resulting in retrieved information from the KB
being in a different language than the rest of the context. In such scenarios,
two common practices are pre-translation to create a mono-lingual prompt and
cross-lingual prompting for direct inference. However, the impact of these
choices remains unclear. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact
of different prompt translation strategies for classification tasks with
RAG-enhanced LLMs in multilingual systems. Experimental results show that an
optimized prompting strategy can significantly improve knowledge sharing across
languages, therefore improve the performance on the downstream classification
task. The findings advocate for a broader utilization of multilingual resource
sharing and cross-lingual prompt optimization for non-English languages,
especially the low-resource ones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着美国计算机硕士课程中国际学生比例增加（2023年占60.2%），且许多学生以非母语学习，研究旨在分析语言背景对在线课程互评体验的影响。

Method: 使用Twitter-roBERTa模型分析500名学生的互评文本情感，并结合语言背景、性别和年龄进行统计。

Result: 母语英语学生对反馈评分较低，非母语者写得更积极但收到的情感反馈较少；语言背景与性别、年龄交互作用显著。

Conclusion: 语言背景对互评体验有复杂但适度的影响，需在在线教育设计中加以考虑。

Abstract: Graduate-level CS programs in the U.S. increasingly enroll international
students, with 60.2 percent of master's degrees in 2023 awarded to non-U.S.
students. Many of these students take online courses, where peer feedback is
used to engage students and improve pedagogy in a scalable manner. Since these
courses are conducted in English, many students study in a language other than
their first. This paper examines how native versus non-native English speaker
status affects three metrics of peer feedback experience in online U.S.-based
computing courses. Using the Twitter-roBERTa-based model, we analyze the
sentiment of peer reviews written by and to a random sample of 500 students. We
then relate sentiment scores and peer feedback ratings to students' language
background. Results show that native English speakers rate feedback less
favorably, while non-native speakers write more positively but receive less
positive sentiment in return. When controlling for sex and age, significant
interactions emerge, suggesting that language background plays a modest but
complex role in shaping peer feedback experiences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆机制在结构化组织和高效检索方面存在不足，限制了LLM代理的决策能力和上下文连贯性。

Method: 采用分层记忆架构，通过语义抽象多级组织记忆，并引入索引路由机制实现高效检索。

Result: 在LoCoMo数据集的五个任务中，H-MEM显著优于五种基线方法。

Conclusion: H-MEM有效提升了LLM代理在长期对话场景中的表现。

Abstract: Long-term memory is one of the key factors influencing the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Model Agents (LLM Agents). Incorporating a
memory mechanism that effectively integrates past interactions can
significantly enhance decision-making and contextual coherence of LLM Agents.
While recent works have made progress in memory storage and retrieval, such as
encoding memory into dense vectors for similarity-based search or organizing
knowledge in the form of graph, these approaches often fall short in structured
memory organization and efficient retrieval. To address these limitations, we
propose a Hierarchical Memory (H-MEM) architecture for LLM Agents that
organizes and updates memory in a multi-level fashion based on the degree of
semantic abstraction. Each memory vector is embedded with a positional index
encoding pointing to its semantically related sub-memories in the next layer.
During the reasoning phase, an index-based routing mechanism enables efficient,
layer-by-layer retrieval without performing exhaustive similarity computations.
We evaluate our method on five task settings from the LoCoMo dataset.
Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms five
baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in long-term dialogue
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在文档级关系抽取中，实体可能在文档中多次出现，且其关系可能因上下文不同而变化。传统方法仅关注实体出现的句子，无法捕捉完整的文档上下文，导致关系抽取不准确。

Method: 提出一种新的输入嵌入方法，通过将实体表示为独立片段（独立于其在文档中的位置），以捕捉全局关系和多句子推理。

Result: 在DocRED、Re-DocRED和REBEL三个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法能准确预测文档级实体关系。

Conclusion: 该方法在理论上推动了全局上下文建模和多句子推理的研究，实践上提升了关系检测性能，适用于需要全面实体级洞察和可解释性的NLP应用。

Abstract: In document-level relation extraction, entities may appear multiple times in
a document, and their relationships can shift from one context to another.
Accurate prediction of the relationship between two entities across an entire
document requires building a global context spanning all relevant sentences.
Previous approaches have focused only on the sentences where entities are
mentioned, which fails to capture the complete document context necessary for
accurate relation extraction. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel input
embedding approach to capture the positions of mentioned entities throughout
the document rather than focusing solely on the span where they appear. The
proposed input encoding approach leverages global relationships and
multi-sentence reasoning by representing entities as standalone segments,
independent of their positions within the document. The performance of the
proposed method has been tested on three benchmark relation extraction
datasets, namely DocRED, Re-DocRED, and REBEL. The experimental results
demonstrated that the proposed method accurately predicts relationships between
entities in a document-level setting. The proposed research also has
theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, it advances global
context modeling and multi-sentence reasoning in document-level relation
extraction. Practically, it enhances relationship detection, enabling improved
performance in real-world NLP applications requiring comprehensive entity-level
insights and interpretability.

Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注RAG系统的整体性能，而缺乏对LLM在文档利用方面的系统性和细粒度评估。

Method: 通过创新的占位符方法，分离LLM的参数化知识和外部知识的贡献，并设计了多层次的评估维度（过滤能力、组合能力和参考推理）。

Result: 实验表明，代表性LLM在RAG系统中的生成能力存在局限性，尤其是在错误恢复和上下文忠实度方面。

Conclusion: 该基准测试为开发更可靠和高效的RAG系统提供了可复现的框架。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external knowledge, where the LLM's ability to generate responses
based on the combination of a given query and retrieved documents is crucial.
However, most benchmarks focus on overall RAG system performance, rarely
assessing LLM-specific capabilities. Current benchmarks emphasize broad aspects
such as noise robustness, but lack a systematic and granular evaluation
framework on document utilization. To this end, we introduce
\textit{Placeholder-RAG-Benchmark}, a multi-level fine-grained benchmark,
emphasizing the following progressive dimensions: (1) multi-level filtering
abilities, (2) combination abilities, and (3) reference reasoning. To provide a
more nuanced understanding of LLMs' roles in RAG systems, we formulate an
innovative placeholder-based approach to decouple the contributions of the
LLM's parametric knowledge and the external knowledge. Experiments demonstrate
the limitations of representative LLMs in the RAG system's generation
capabilities, particularly in error resilience and context faithfulness. Our
benchmark provides a reproducible framework for developing more reliable and
efficient RAG systems. Our code is available in

Motivation: 探究CoT生成的“思考”是否真实反映模型的内部推理过程，以及CoT对模型内部结构的影响。

Method: 结合稀疏自编码器和激活修补技术，分析Pythia-70M和Pythia-2.8B在GSM8K数学问题上的表现。

Result: 在2.8B模型中，CoT显著提升答案概率和激活稀疏性，但在70M模型中无显著效果。

Conclusion: CoT在高容量模型中能诱导更模块化的内部计算结构，验证其作为结构化提示方法的有效性。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting boosts Large Language Models accuracy on
multi-step tasks, yet whether the generated "thoughts" reflect the true
internal reasoning process is unresolved. We present the first feature-level
causal study of CoT faithfulness. Combining sparse autoencoders with activation
patching, we extract monosemantic features from Pythia-70M and Pythia-2.8B
while they tackle GSM8K math problems under CoT and plain (noCoT) prompting.
Swapping a small set of CoT-reasoning features into a noCoT run raises answer
log-probabilities significantly in the 2.8B model, but has no reliable effect
in 70M, revealing a clear scale threshold. CoT also leads to significantly
higher activation sparsity and feature interpretability scores in the larger
model, signalling more modular internal computation. For example, the model's
confidence in generating correct answers improves from 1.2 to 4.3. We introduce
patch-curves and random-feature patching baselines, showing that useful CoT
information is not only present in the top-K patches but widely distributed.
Overall, our results indicate that CoT can induce more interpretable internal
structures in high-capacity LLMs, validating its role as a structured prompting
method.

Motivation: MLLMs在眼科诊断中因幻觉问题（如知识不足、视觉定位能力差）而受限，且现有基准无法有效评估或解决这些问题。

Method: 提出EH-Benchmark，将幻觉分为视觉理解和逻辑组合两类，并设计了一个三阶段的多代理框架（知识检索、任务案例研究、结果验证）。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著减少了幻觉，提升了模型的准确性、可解释性和可靠性。

Conclusion: EH-Benchmark为MLLMs的幻觉问题提供了有效的评估和解决方案，推动了眼科诊断的进步。

Abstract: Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) play a crucial role in ophthalmic
diagnosis, holding significant potential to address vision-threatening
diseases. However, their accuracy is constrained by hallucinations stemming
from limited ophthalmic knowledge, insufficient visual localization and
reasoning capabilities, and a scarcity of multimodal ophthalmic data, which
collectively impede precise lesion detection and disease diagnosis.
Furthermore, existing medical benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate various
types of hallucinations or provide actionable solutions to mitigate them. To
address the above challenges, we introduce EH-Benchmark, a novel ophthalmology
benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in MLLMs. We categorize MLLMs'
hallucinations based on specific tasks and error types into two primary
classes: Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, each comprising multiple
subclasses. Given that MLLMs predominantly rely on language-based reasoning
rather than visual processing, we propose an agent-centric, three-phase
framework, including the Knowledge-Level Retrieval stage, the Task-Level Case
Studies stage, and the Result-Level Validation stage. Experimental results show
that our multi-agent framework significantly mitigates both types of
hallucinations, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and reliability. Our
project is available at https://github.com/ppxy1/EH-Benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交平台上的自我披露可能导致隐私风险，但缺乏开源标注数据集阻碍了相关研究。

Method: 使用三种LLMs生成合成PII数据，并通过指令提示模拟Reddit帖子。

Result: 合成数据在可重现性、不可链接性和不可区分性方面表现良好。

Conclusion: 提出的方法和数据集有助于推动在线社交媒体隐私风险的可重复研究。

Abstract: Social platforms such as Reddit have a network of communities of shared
interests, with a prevalence of posts and comments from which one can infer
users' Personal Information Identifiers (PIIs). While such self-disclosures can
lead to rewarding social interactions, they pose privacy risks and the threat
of online harms. Research into the identification and retrieval of such risky
self-disclosures of PIIs is hampered by the lack of open-source labeled
datasets. To foster reproducible research into PII-revealing text detection, we
develop a novel methodology to create synthetic equivalents of PII-revealing
data that can be safely shared. Our contributions include creating a taxonomy
of 19 PII-revealing categories for vulnerable populations and the creation and
release of a synthetic PII-labeled multi-text span dataset generated from 3
text generation Large Language Models (LLMs), Llama2-7B, Llama3-8B, and
zephyr-7b-beta, with sequential instruction prompting to resemble the original
Reddit posts. The utility of our methodology to generate this synthetic dataset
is evaluated with three metrics: First, we require reproducibility equivalence,
i.e., results from training a model on the synthetic data should be comparable
to those obtained by training the same models on the original posts. Second, we
require that the synthetic data be unlinkable to the original users, through
common mechanisms such as Google Search. Third, we wish to ensure that the
synthetic data be indistinguishable from the original, i.e., trained humans
should not be able to tell them apart. We release our dataset and code at
https://netsys.surrey.ac.uk/datasets/synthetic-self-disclosure/ to foster
reproducible research into PII privacy risks in online social media.

### [116] [Enhancing RAG Efficiency with Adaptive Context Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22931)
*Shuyu Guo,Zhaochun Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ACC-RAG动态调整压缩率以优化检索增强生成的推理效率，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有固定压缩率方法无法适应查询复杂度，导致效率低下或信息损失。

Method: 结合分层压缩器和上下文选择器，动态调整压缩率。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于固定压缩率方法，推理速度提升4倍。

Conclusion: ACC-RAG在效率和准确性上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs)
with external knowledge but incurs significant inference costs due to lengthy
retrieved contexts. While context compression mitigates this issue, existing
methods apply fixed compression rates, over-compressing simple queries or
under-compressing complex ones. We propose Adaptive Context Compression for RAG
(ACC-RAG), a framework that dynamically adjusts compression rates based on
input complexity, optimizing inference efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.
ACC-RAG combines a hierarchical compressor (for multi-granular embeddings) with
a context selector to retain minimal sufficient information, akin to human
skimming. Evaluated on Wikipedia and five QA datasets, ACC-RAG outperforms
fixed-rate methods and matches/unlocks over 4 times faster inference versus
standard RAG while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Result: 神经符号系统能提供更可解释的输出，并能无需大量重新训练即可整合新信息。

Conclusion: 神经符号集成是改进视觉语言理解的一种实用方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in visual-language machine learning models have demonstrated
exceptional ability to use natural language and understand visual scenes by
training on large, unstructured datasets. However, this training paradigm
cannot produce interpretable explanations for its outputs, requires retraining
to integrate new information, is highly resource-intensive, and struggles with
certain forms of logical reasoning. One promising solution involves integrating
neural networks with external symbolic information systems, forming neural
symbolic systems that can enhance reasoning and memory abilities. These neural
symbolic systems provide more interpretable explanations to their outputs and
the capacity to assimilate new information without extensive retraining.
Utilizing powerful pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as the core neural
component, augmented by external systems, offers a pragmatic approach to
realizing the benefits of neural-symbolic integration. This systematic
literature review aims to categorize techniques through which visual-language
understanding can be improved by interacting with external symbolic information
systems.

Abstract: Deriving operational intelligence from organizational data repositories is a
key challenge due to the dichotomy of data confidentiality vs data integration
objectives, as well as the limitations of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tools relative to the specific knowledge structure of domains such as
operations and maintenance. In this work, we discuss Knowledge Graph
construction and break down the Knowledge Extraction process into its Named
Entity Recognition, Coreference Resolution, Named Entity Linking, and Relation
Extraction functional components. We then evaluate sixteen NLP tools in concert
with or in comparison to the rapidly advancing capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). We focus on the operational and maintenance intelligence use
case for trusted applications in the aircraft industry. A baseline dataset is
derived from a rich public domain US Federal Aviation Administration dataset
focused on equipment failures or maintenance requirements. We assess the
zero-shot performance of NLP and LLM tools that can be operated within a
controlled, confidential environment (no data is sent to third parties). Based
on our observation of significant performance limitations, we discuss the
challenges related to trusted NLP and LLM tools as well as their Technical
Readiness Level for wider use in mission-critical industries such as aviation.
We conclude with recommendations to enhance trust and provide our open-source
curated dataset to support further baseline testing and evaluation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大语言模型在金融分析中的快速发展和广泛应用，但缺乏系统比较，因此本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 研究使用10-K文件，设计领域特定提示，并通过人工标注、自动语义指标（如ROUGE、余弦相似性、Jaccard）和模型行为诊断（如提示级方差和跨模型相似性）三种方法评估模型表现。

Result: GPT在连贯性、语义对齐和上下文相关性上表现最佳，Claude和Perplexity次之，Gemini和DeepSeek表现较不稳定且一致性较低。

Conclusion: 大语言模型的表现受提示设计和源材料影响较大，需进一步优化提示和模型选择以提高金融任务中的稳定性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide variety of Financial Natural Language Processing (FinNLP) tasks.
However, systematic comparisons among widely used LLMs remain underexplored.
Given the rapid advancement and growing influence of LLMs in financial
analysis, this study conducts a thorough comparative evaluation of five leading
LLMs, GPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini and DeepSeek, using 10-K filings from the
'Magnificent Seven' technology companies. We create a set of domain-specific
prompts and then use three methodologies to evaluate model performance: human
annotation, automated lexical-semantic metrics (ROUGE, Cosine Similarity,
Jaccard), and model behavior diagnostics (prompt-level variance and
across-model similarity). The results show that GPT gives the most coherent,
semantically aligned, and contextually relevant answers; followed by Claude and
Perplexity. Gemini and DeepSeek, on the other hand, have more variability and
less agreement. Also, the similarity and stability of outputs change from
company to company and over time, showing that they are sensitive to how
prompts are written and what source material is used.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AIOps模型受限于领域知识，单一模型仅能处理特定任务，而多模型协作在提升效率方面已被证明有效。本文旨在解决AIOps中的类似挑战。

Method: 提出CoE-Ops框架，结合大语言模型任务分类器和检索增强生成机制，支持高低级任务处理。

Result: 在DevOps-EVAL数据集上，CoE-Ops在高阶任务路由准确率上提升72%，在问题解决准确率上比单一模型高8%，比MoE模型高14%。

Conclusion: CoE-Ops框架显著提升了AIOps任务的性能，证明了多模型协作的有效性。

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence, AIOps has emerged as a
prominent paradigm in DevOps. Lots of work has been proposed to improve the
performance of different AIOps phases. However, constrained by domain-specific
knowledge, a single model can only handle the operation requirement of a
specific task,such as log parser,root cause analysis. Meanwhile, combining
multiple models can achieve more efficient results, which have been proved in
both previous ensemble learning and the recent LLM training domain. Inspired by
these works,to address the similar challenges in AIOPS, this paper first
proposes a collaboration-of-expert framework(CoE-Ops) incorporating a
general-purpose large language model task classifier. A retrieval-augmented
generation mechanism is introduced to improve the framework's capability in
handling both Question-Answering tasks with high-level(Code,build,Test,etc.)
and low-level(fault analysis,anomaly detection,etc.). Finally, the proposed
method is implemented in the AIOps domain, and extensive experiments are
conducted on the DevOps-EVAL dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that
CoE-Ops achieves a 72% improvement in routing accuracy for high-level AIOps
tasks compared to existing CoE methods, delivers up to 8% accuracy enhancement
over single AIOps models in DevOps problem resolution, and outperforms
larger-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models by up to 14% in accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合视觉语言模型（VLM）生成的流程图图表示与文本检索增强生成（RAG）系统的方法，用于技术文档中的问答（QA）。该方法在电信领域验证了图像检索的有效性，并降低了推理时对VLM的依赖。


<details>

Motivation: 技术文档中的问答常涉及图表内容，传统文本RAG系统难以处理此类问题。论文旨在通过结合图表示提升QA性能。

Method: 方法包括处理技术文档、分类图像类型、构建图表示，并将其与文本嵌入管道结合以实现高效检索。

Result: 实验表明，基于微调VLM生成的图表示与真实值编辑距离更小，且检索性能良好。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了QA性能，还减少了推理时对VLM的需求，具有成本优势。

Abstract: Question-Answering (QA) from technical documents often involves questions
whose answers are present in figures, such as flowcharts or flow diagrams.
Text-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems may fail to answer such
questions. We leverage graph representations of flowcharts obtained from Visual
large Language Models (VLMs) and incorporate them in a text-based RAG system to
show that this approach can enable image retrieval for QA in the telecom
domain. We present the end-to-end approach from processing technical documents,
classifying image types, building graph representations, and incorporating them
with the text embedding pipeline for efficient retrieval. We benchmark the same
on a QA dataset created based on proprietary telecom product information
documents. Results show that the graph representations obtained using a
fine-tuned VLM model have lower edit distance with respect to the ground truth,
which illustrate the robustness of these representations for flowchart images.
Further, the approach for QA using these representations gives good retrieval
performance using text-based embedding models, including a telecom-domain
adapted one. Our approach also alleviates the need for a VLM in inference,
which is an important cost benefit for deployed QA systems.

regions, with chest (19.9%), abdomen (18.6%), head (17.3%), and pelvis (14.1%)
being most prevalent. In the differentiation study, participants achieved 53.9%
accuracy (95% CI: 50.7%-57.1%) in distinguishing between human and AI-generated
reports, with radiologists performing significantly better (56.9%, 95% CI:
53.3%-60.6%, p<0.05) than other groups. Conclusion: PARROT represents the
largest open multilingual radiology report dataset, enabling development and
validation of natural language processing applications across linguistic,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在推理过程中存在事实错误的问题，特别是在高风险领域可能导致的严重后果。

Method: 结合事实检查分类器、GRPO强化学习和可解释性模块，优化推理过程的事实性和结构正确性。

Result: 显著提升事实准确性（最高49.90%），并在多个基准测试中保持或提升性能。

Conclusion: RELIANCE为未来通过激活引导优化提升事实鲁棒性的训练方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: We present RELIANCE (Reasoning Evaluation with Logical Integrity and Accuracy
for Confidence Enhancement), a novel framework addressing a critical
vulnerability in Large Language Models (LLMs): the prevalence of factual
inaccuracies within intermediate reasoning steps despite correct final answers.
This phenomenon poses substantial risks in high-stakes domains including
healthcare, legal analysis, and scientific research, where erroneous yet
confidently presented reasoning can mislead users into dangerous decisions. Our
framework integrates three core components: (1) a specialized fact-checking
classifier trained on counterfactually augmented data to detect subtle factual
inconsistencies within reasoning chains; (2) a Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning approach that balances factuality,
coherence, and structural correctness through multi-dimensional rewards; and
(3) a mechanistic interpretability module examining how factuality improvements
manifest in model activations during reasoning processes. Extensive evaluation
across ten state-of-the-art models reveals concerning patterns: even leading
models like Claude-3.7 and GPT-o1 demonstrate reasoning factual accuracy of
only 81.93% and 82.57% respectively. RELIANCE significantly enhances factual
robustness (up to 49.90% improvement) while maintaining or improving
performance on challenging benchmarks including Math-500, AIME-2024, and GPQA.
Furthermore, our activation-level analysis provides actionable insights into
how factual enhancements reshape reasoning trajectories within model
architectures, establishing foundations for future training methodologies that
explicitly target factual robustness through activation-guided optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生存分析方法难以有效处理文本数据的复杂性，尤其是时序形式的临床报告。

Method: SigBERT通过提取和平均词嵌入生成句子嵌入，利用粗糙路径理论提取签名特征，结合LASSO惩罚的Cox模型进行风险评分。

Result: 在真实肿瘤数据集上，SigBERT的C-index得分为0.75（标准差0.014）。

Conclusion: SigBERT通过整合时序医疗数据，提升了基于叙事的生存分析能力。

Abstract: Electronic medical reports (EHR) contain a vast amount of information that
can be leveraged for machine learning applications in healthcare. However,
existing survival analysis methods often struggle to effectively handle the
complexity of textual data, particularly in its sequential form. Here, we
propose SigBERT, an innovative temporal survival analysis framework designed to
efficiently process a large number of clinical reports per patient. SigBERT
processes timestamped medical reports by extracting and averaging word
embeddings into sentence embeddings. To capture temporal dynamics from the time
series of sentence embedding coordinates, we apply signature extraction from
rough path theory to derive geometric features for each patient, which
significantly enhance survival model performance by capturing complex temporal
dynamics. These features are then integrated into a LASSO-penalized Cox model
to estimate patient-specific risk scores. The model was trained and evaluated
on a real-world oncology dataset from the L\'eon B\'erard Center corpus, with a
C-index score of 0.75 (sd 0.014) on the independent test cohort. SigBERT
integrates sequential medical data to enhance risk estimation, advancing
narrative-based survival analysis.

Result: NLP辅助审查减少了40%的图表审查时间，多波采样避免了77%的图表审查，且精度损失有限。

Conclusion: 该方法可促进对基于代码的算法的常规验证，提升数据库研究结果的可靠性。

Abstract: Background: One of the ways to enhance analyses conducted with large claims
databases is by validating the measurement characteristics of code-based
algorithms used to identify health outcomes or other key study parameters of
interest. These metrics can be used in quantitative bias analyses to assess the
robustness of results for an inferential study given potential bias from
outcome misclassification. However, extensive time and resource allocation are
typically re-quired to create reference-standard labels through manual chart
review of free-text notes from linked electronic health records. Methods: We
describe an expedited process that introduces efficiency in a validation study
us-ing two distinct mechanisms: 1) use of natural language processing (NLP) to
reduce time spent by human reviewers to review each chart, and 2) a multi-wave
adaptive sampling approach with pre-defined criteria to stop the validation
study once performance characteristics are identified with sufficient
precision. We illustrate this process in a case study that validates the
performance of a claims-based outcome algorithm for intentional self-harm in
patients with obesity. Results: We empirically demonstrate that the
NLP-assisted annotation process reduced the time spent on review per chart by
40% and use of the pre-defined stopping rule with multi-wave samples would have
prevented review of 77% of patient charts with limited compromise to precision
in derived measurement characteristics. Conclusion: This approach could
facilitate more routine validation of code-based algorithms used to define key
study parameters, ultimately enhancing understanding of the reliability of
find-ings derived from database studies.

arbitrariness with injustice, it posits arbitrariness as a semiotic trait: a
property enabling systems - linguistic, legal, or social - to operate
effectively while withholding their internal rationale. Building on Ferdinand
de Saussure's concept of l'arbitraire du signe, the analysis extends this
principle beyond language to demonstrate its cross-domain applicability,
particularly in law and social dynamics. The paper introduces the "Motivation
-> Constatability -> Contestability" chain, arguing that motivation functions
as a crucial interface rendering an act's logic vulnerable to intersubjective
contestation. When this chain is broken through mechanisms like
"immotivization" or "Conflict Lateralization" (exemplified by "the blur of the
wolf drowned in the fish"), acts produce binding effects without exposing their
rationale, thus precluding justiciability. This structural opacity, while
appearing illogical, is a deliberate design protecting authority from
accountability. Drawing on Shannon's entropy model, the paper formalizes
arbitrariness as A = H(L|M) (conditional entropy). It thereby proposes a modern
theory of arbitrariness as a neutral operator central to control as well as
care, an overlooked dimension of interpersonal relations. While primarily
developed through human social systems, this framework also illuminates a new
pathway for analyzing explainability in advanced artificial intelligence
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个用于评估口语对话模型（SDMs）性能的基准数据集，包含1079个中英文实例，并采用基于LLM的评估方法，以解决SDMs在理解和模拟人类对话中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究SDMs在实际对话中的有效性，填补与文本大语言模型（LLMs）相比的评估空白，解决口语对话中的歧义和上下文依赖性等复杂问题。

Method: 构建包含1079个中英文实例的基准数据集，并开发基于LLM的评估方法，以模拟人类判断。

Result: 数据集和评估方法为SDMs的性能提供了全面分析工具，揭示了其在处理口语对话挑战中的表现。

Conclusion: 该研究为SDMs的发展提供了重要基准，有助于未来改进其在复杂对话场景中的应用。

Abstract: Spoken Dialogue Models (SDMs) have recently attracted significant attention
for their ability to generate voice responses directly to users' spoken
queries. Despite their increasing popularity, there exists a gap in research
focused on comprehensively understanding their practical effectiveness in
comprehending and emulating human conversations. This is especially true
compared to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), which benefit from
extensive benchmarking. Human voice interactions are inherently more complex
than text due to characteristics unique to spoken dialogue. Ambiguity poses one
challenge, stemming from semantic factors like polysemy, as well as
phonological aspects such as heterograph, heteronyms, and stress patterns.
Additionally, context-dependency, like omission, coreference, and multi-turn
interaction, adds further complexity to human conversational dynamics. To
illuminate the current state of SDM development and to address these
challenges, we present a benchmark dataset in this paper, which comprises 1,079
instances in English and Chinese. Accompanied by an LLM-based evaluation method
that closely aligns with human judgment, this dataset facilitates a
comprehensive exploration of the performance of SDMs in tackling these
practical challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在数学文本推理任务中的能力，填补Math NLI领域的研究空白。

Method: 构建人类标注的Math NLI数据集，并让LLMs生成假设，比较其表现和一致性。

Result: 部分情况下LLMs多数投票结果接近人类标注，但仍存在数学语言理解不足的问题。

Conclusion: LLMs在Math NLI任务中有潜力但需改进，数据集将支持未来研究。

Abstract: We ask whether contemporary LLMs are able to perform natural language
inference (NLI) tasks on mathematical texts. We call this the Math NLI problem.
We construct a corpus of Math NLI pairs whose premises are from extant
mathematical text and whose hypotheses and gold labels were provided by people
with experience in both research-level mathematics and also in the NLI field.
We also investigate the quality of corpora using the same premises but whose
hypotheses are provided by LLMs themselves. We not only investigate the
performance but also the inter-group consistency of the diverse group of LLMs.
We have both positive and negative findings. Among our positive findings: in
some settings, using a majority vote of LLMs is approximately equivalent to
using human-labeled data in the Math NLI area. On the negative side: LLMs still
struggle with mathematical language. They occasionally fail at even basic
inferences. Current models are not as prone to hypothesis-only "inference" in
our data the way the previous generation had been. In addition to our findings,
we also provide our corpora as data to support future work on Math NLI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了利用大型语言模型（LLMs）的上下文学习（ICL）进行框架语义解析（FSP），无需微调模型，通过自动生成任务特定提示在FrameNet数据库上实现竞争性结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索无需微调模型的方法，利用ICL和LLMs完成FSP任务，以简化流程并提高效率。

Method: 提出一种方法，自动生成针对框架识别（FI）和框架语义角色标注（FSRL）子任务的提示，基于FrameNet数据库的框架定义和标注示例，指导六种不同LLMs。

Result: 在暴力事件相关帧子集上，FI和FSRL的F1分数分别达到94.3%和77.4%。

Conclusion: ICL为领域特定FSP任务提供了一种实用且有效的替代传统微调的方法。

Abstract: Frame Semantic Parsing (FSP) entails identifying predicates and labeling
their arguments according to Frame Semantics. This paper investigates the use
of In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform FSP
without model fine-tuning. We propose a method that automatically generates
task-specific prompts for the Frame Identification (FI) and Frame Semantic Role
Labeling (FSRL) subtasks, relying solely on the FrameNet database. These
prompts, constructed from frame definitions and annotated examples, are used to
guide six different LLMs. Experiments are conducted on a subset of frames
related to violent events. The method achieves competitive results, with F1
scores of 94.3% for FI and 77.4% for FSRL. The findings suggest that ICL offers
a practical and effective alternative to traditional fine-tuning for
domain-specific FSP tasks.

TL;DR: CARoPE是一种新型的位置编码方法，通过动态生成与上下文相关的频率模式，改进了传统的RoPE，显著提升了Transformer模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的RoPE依赖于静态的频率模式，无法建模上下文敏感的关系，限制了其表达能力。

Method: CARoPE通过动态生成与token嵌入相关的频率模式，引入上下文敏感的位置表示，同时保持了RoPE的高效性和简洁性。

Result: 在FineWeb-Edu-10B数据集上，CARoPE显著降低了困惑度，并在长上下文长度下表现更优，同时保持了训练效率。

Conclusion: CARoPE为Transformer模型提供了一种可扩展、表达力强且高效的位置编码升级方案。

Abstract: Positional encoding is a vital component of Transformer architectures,
enabling models to incorporate sequence order into self-attention mechanisms.
Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) have become a widely adopted solution due
to their compatibility with relative position encoding and computational
efficiency. However, RoPE relies on static, input-independent sinusoidal
frequency patterns, limiting its ability to model context-sensitive
relationships. In this work, we propose CARoPE (Context-Aware Rotary Positional
Embedding), a novel generalization of RoPE that dynamically generates
head-specific frequency patterns conditioned on token embeddings. This design
introduces token- and context-sensitive positional representations while
preserving RoPE efficiency and architectural simplicity. CARoPE computes
input-dependent phase shifts using a bounded transformation of token embeddings
and integrates them into the rotary mechanism across attention heads. We
evaluate CARoPE on the FineWeb-Edu-10B dataset using GPT-2 variants trained on
next-token prediction tasks. Experimental results show that CARoPE consistently
outperforms RoPE and other common positional encoding baselines, achieving
significantly lower perplexity, even at longer context lengths. Additionally,
CARoPE enables faster training throughput without sacrificing model stability.
These findings demonstrate that CARoPE offers a scalable, expressive, and
efficient upgrade to existing positional encoding strategies in Transformer
models.

Method: 采用Reward-Refine（推理时奖励引导优化）和RewardDPO（训练时奖励对齐偏好优化）两种策略。

Result: 在SMARTEdit-Bench基准测试中表现优异，RewardDPO在结构化场景提升15%，Reward-Refine在自然图像中表现突出。

Conclusion: 奖励引导的规划在编辑中能有效保持语义一致性和视觉对齐，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: We present SMART-Editor, a framework for compositional layout and content
editing across structured (posters, websites) and unstructured (natural images)
domains. Unlike prior models that perform local edits, SMART-Editor preserves
global coherence through two strategies: Reward-Refine, an inference-time
rewardguided refinement method, and RewardDPO, a training-time preference
optimization approach using reward-aligned layout pairs. To evaluate model
performance, we introduce SMARTEdit-Bench, a benchmark covering multi-domain,
cascading edit scenarios. SMART-Editor outperforms strong baselines like
InstructPix2Pix and HIVE, with RewardDPO achieving up to 15% gains in
structured settings and Reward-Refine showing advantages on natural images.
Automatic and human evaluations confirm the value of reward-guided planning in
producing semantically consistent and visually aligned edits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖领域微调且未能充分利用数据库元数据中的语义信息，限制了在大型企业数据目录中的可扩展性。

Method: 通过将数据库模式和元数据分解为离散语义单元并分别索引，实现针对性检索，同时控制检索表的数量。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在高召回率和准确率上优于基线，适用于不同结构和元数据的海量数据库。

Conclusion: 该解决方案填补了自然语言数据库接口在可扩展性上的关键空白，适用于多样化的企业环境。

Abstract: Despite advances in large language model (LLM)-based natural language
interfaces for databases, scaling to enterprise-level data catalogs remains an
under-explored challenge. Prior works addressing this challenge rely on
domain-specific fine-tuning - complicating deployment - and fail to leverage
important semantic context contained within database metadata. To address these
limitations, we introduce a component-based retrieval architecture that
decomposes database schemas and metadata into discrete semantic units, each
separately indexed for targeted retrieval. Our approach prioritizes effective
table identification while leveraging column-level information, ensuring the
total number of retrieved tables remains within a manageable context budget.
Experiments demonstrate that our method maintains high recall and accuracy,
with our system outperforming baselines over massive databases with varying
structure and available metadata. Our solution enables practical text-to-SQL
systems deployable across diverse enterprise settings without specialized
fine-tuning, addressing a critical scalability gap in natural language database
interfaces.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在遇到模糊叙述文本时的可信度问题，特别是中文文本歧义。

Method: 创建了一个包含歧义句子及其消歧对的基准数据集，分为3大类9小类，并通过实验分析LLMs的表现。

Result: LLMs无法可靠区分歧义文本与非歧义文本，对歧义文本表现出过度自信和过度思考。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在处理语言歧义时存在根本性局限，需改进方法来应对语言理解中的不确定性。

Abstract: In this work, we study a critical research problem regarding the
trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs): how LLMs behave when
encountering ambiguous narrative text, with a particular focus on Chinese
textual ambiguity. We created a benchmark dataset by collecting and generating
ambiguous sentences with context and their corresponding disambiguated pairs,
representing multiple possible interpretations. These annotated examples are
systematically categorized into 3 main categories and 9 subcategories. Through
experiments, we discovered significant fragility in LLMs when handling
ambiguity, revealing behavior that differs substantially from humans.
Specifically, LLMs cannot reliably distinguish ambiguous text from unambiguous
text, show overconfidence in interpreting ambiguous text as having a single
meaning rather than multiple meanings, and exhibit overthinking when attempting
to understand the various possible meanings. Our findings highlight a
fundamental limitation in current LLMs that has significant implications for
their deployment in real-world applications where linguistic ambiguity is
common, calling for improved approaches to handle uncertainty in language
understanding. The dataset and code are publicly available at this GitHub

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解多模态间的因果关系是现实环境中多模态模型的核心挑战。

Method: 通过图像和文本片段的任务步骤对比，评估模型是否能推断视觉观察与程序文本之间的因果依赖。

Result: 前沿视觉语言模型表现不佳，零样本F1最高仅0.57，思维链推理略有提升（最高0.62），远低于人类（0.98）。

Conclusion: 研究为提升多模态模型的因果理解提供了具体方向。

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships across modalities is a core challenge for
multimodal models operating in real-world environments. We introduce ISO-Bench,
a benchmark for evaluating whether models can infer causal dependencies between
visual observations and procedural text. Each example presents an image of a
task step and a text snippet from a plan, with the goal of deciding whether the
visual step occurs before or after the referenced text step. Evaluation results
on ten frontier vision-language models show underwhelming performance: the best
zero-shot F1 is only 0.57, and chain-of-thought reasoning yields only modest
gains (up to 0.62 F1), largely behind humans (0.98 F1). Our analysis further
highlights concrete directions for improving causal understanding in multimodal
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过用户与语言模型交互日志中的隐式反馈改进模型性能，发现反馈内容（如用户需要澄清）比极性（如用户不满）更能提升模型在短问题上的表现，但效果受初始提示质量影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何在不直接打扰用户的情况下，通过隐式用户反馈持续优化语言模型。

Method: 分析WildChat和LMSYS数据集中的用户反馈，研究反馈内容和极性对模型性能的影响。

Result: 反馈内容能提升模型在短问题（MTBench）上的表现，但对复杂问题（WildBench）无效；反馈效果与用户初始提示质量相关。

Conclusion: 隐式用户反馈有潜力改进模型，但其效果有限且依赖初始提示质量。

Abstract: Once language models (LMs) are deployed, they can interact with users
long-term, ideally evolving continuously based on their feedback. Asking for
direct user feedback can be disruptive; thus, we study harvesting user feedback
from user-LM interaction logs. We study implicit user feedback in two user-LM
interaction datasets (WildChat and LMSYS). First, we analyze user feedback in
the user-LLM conversation trajectory, providing insights into when and why such
feedback occurs. Second, we study harvesting learning signals from such
implicit user feedback. We find that the contents of user feedback (e.g., user
wanted clarification), not just the polarity (e.g., users were unhappy with the
previous model response), can improve model performance in short human-designed
questions (MTBench) but not on longer and more complex questions (WildBench).
We also find that the usefulness of user feedback is largely tied to the
quality of the user's initial prompt. Together, we provide an in-depth study of
implicit user feedback, showing its potential and limitations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集成方法忽略了模型在不同上下文中的置信度和可靠性差异，需要更精细的权重分配。

Method: 为每个LLM训练轻量级线性置信度预测器，利用层间隐藏状态和归一化概率作为输入。

Result: 在多项选择和布尔问答任务中，LENS显著优于传统集成方法。

Conclusion: 内部表示为模型置信度提供了有价值的信号，可用于高效集成学习。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks, with different models excelling in distinct domains and specific
abilities. Effectively combining the predictions of multiple LLMs is crucial
for enhancing system robustness and performance. However, existing ensemble
methods often rely on simple techniques like voting or logits ensembling, which
overlook the varying confidence and reliability of models in different
contexts. In this work, we propose LENS (Learning ENsemble confidence from
Neural States), a novel approach that learns to estimate model confidence by
analyzing internal representations. For each LLM, we train a lightweight linear
confidence predictor that leverages layer-wise hidden states and normalized
probabilities as inputs. This allows for more nuanced weighting of model
predictions based on their context-dependent reliability. Our method does not
require modifying the model parameters and requires negligible additional
computation. Experimental results on multiple-choice and boolean
question-answering tasks demonstrate that LENS outperforms traditional ensemble
methods by a substantial margin. Our findings suggest that internal
representations provide valuable signals for determining model confidence and
can be effectively leveraged for ensemble learning.

Motivation: 随着深度学习工作负载的复杂性和多样性增加，自动化低层内核开发以满足性能和生产力需求变得至关重要。

Method: GEAK采用推理时计算缩放和Reflexion式反馈机制生成Triton代码，专门针对AMD GPU（如MI300X和MI250）。

Conclusion: GEAK展示了基于代理的代码生成在加速多样化硬件平台采用和普及专家级内核性能方面的潜力。

Abstract: The demand for AI-generated GPU kernels is rapidly growing, influenced by the
need for scalable, hardware-optimized solutions in both industry and academia.
As deep learning workloads grow in complexity and diversity, it is imperative
to automate low-level kernel development to meet performance and productivity
demands. Major cloud providers, semiconductor companies, and research
institutions are now investing heavily in AI-driven code generation for GPUs,
aiming to reduce manual optimization efforts while achieving near-expert
performance on hardware like AMD MI300X. The Triton language, a Python-based
DSL for GPU programming, has emerged as a popular target for such AI-generated
kernels due to its balance of performance and ease-of-coding. In this work, we
present an evaluation suite for Triton-based GPU kernels and GEAK (Generating
Efficient AI-centric GPU Kernels)-a framework that leverages cutting-edge LLMs
to generate performant Triton code specifically for AMD GPUs, including the AMD
MI300X and MI250. GEAK leverages inference-time compute scaling to produce
Triton-based GPU kernels using a reasoning loop adapted from Reflexion-style
feedback mechanisms. On two evaluation benchmarks, GEAK significantly
outperformed the baselines of directly prompting frontier LLMs as well as
Reflexion-based generation pipelines by achieving correctness up to $63$% and
execution speed up of up to $2.59$X. These results highlight the promise of
GEAK-like agentic code generation for accelerating the adoption of diverse
hardware platforms and democratizing access to expert-level kernel performance.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在少样本上下文学习中表现出色，但其性能高度依赖于提供的示例。现有研究多关注正样本，忽略了负样本的潜在信息。

Method: 基于Zero-Shot-Cot构建正负样本库，通过语义相似性选择示例，并利用负样本优化正样本选择。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于仅依赖正样本的方法，验证了负样本信息对提升ICL性能的有效性。

Conclusion: 负样本中的额外信息有助于通过优化正样本选择来提升ICL性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models exhibit powerful few-shot in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities, but the performance is highly sensitive to provided examples.
  Recent research has focused on retrieving corresponding examples for each
input query, not only enhancing the efficiency and scalability of the learning
process but also mitigating inherent biases in manual example selection.
  However, these studies have primarily emphasized leveraging Positive samples
while overlooking the additional information within Negative samples for
contextual learning.
  We propose a novel method that utilizes Negative samples to better select
Positive sample examples, thereby enhancing the performance of few-shot ICL.
Initially, we construct Positive and Negative sample corpora based on
Zero-Shot-Cot. Then, during inference, we employ a semantic similarity-based
approach to select the most similar examples from both the Positive and
Negative corpora for a given query. Subsequently, we further retrieve Positive
examples from the Positive sample corpus based on semantic similarity to the
Negative examples, then concatenating them with the previously selected
Positive examples to serve as ICL demonstrations. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach surpasses methods solely relying on the most
similar positive examples for context, validating that the additional
information in negative samples aids in enhancing ICL performance through
improved Positive sample selection.

Motivation: 传统主题模型依赖词袋表示，难以捕捉语义抽象特征；神经变体虽使用更丰富的表示，但仍受限于词列表形式，无法表达复杂主题。

Method: 引入MTMs，利用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）学习可解释特征，定义主题于语义丰富的空间，并支持基于主题的文本生成控制。

Result: 在五个数据集上，MTMs在一致性指标上优于或与传统及神经基线相当，且通过LLM评估框架更受偏好，能有效控制LLM输出。

Conclusion: MTMs通过可解释特征和生成控制能力，显著提升了主题模型的表达能力和实用性。

Abstract: Traditional topic models are effective at uncovering latent themes in large
text collections. However, due to their reliance on bag-of-words
representations, they struggle to capture semantically abstract features. While
some neural variants use richer representations, they are similarly constrained
by expressing topics as word lists, which limits their ability to articulate
complex topics. We introduce Mechanistic Topic Models (MTMs), a class of topic
models that operate on interpretable features learned by sparse autoencoders
(SAEs). By defining topics over this semantically rich space, MTMs can reveal
deeper conceptual themes with expressive feature descriptions. Moreover,
uniquely among topic models, MTMs enable controllable text generation using
topic-based steering vectors. To properly evaluate MTM topics against
word-list-based approaches, we propose \textit{topic judge}, an LLM-based
pairwise comparison evaluation framework. Across five datasets, MTMs match or
exceed traditional and neural baselines on coherence metrics, are consistently
preferred by topic judge, and enable effective steering of LLM outputs.

Method: 利用TableGPT2的多模态能力，通过小样本提示和qLoRA微调，构建了TAP-GPT框架用于AD分类任务。

Result: TAP-GPT在AD诊断任务中表现优于通用LLM和TFM。

Conclusion: TAP-GPT是首个将LLM应用于生物标志物数据预测的框架，为未来生物医学信息学中的多代理框架铺平了道路。

Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex
neurodegenerative disorder, requires analysis of heterogeneous biomarkers
(e.g., neuroimaging, genetic risk factors, cognitive tests, and cerebrospinal
fluid proteins) typically represented in a tabular format. With flexible
few-shot reasoning, multimodal integration, and natural-language-based
interpretability, large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented
opportunities for prediction with structured biomedical data. We propose a
novel framework called TAP-GPT, Tabular Alzheimer's Prediction GPT, that adapts
TableGPT2, a multimodal tabular-specialized LLM originally developed for
business intelligence tasks, for AD diagnosis using structured biomarker data
with small sample sizes. Our approach constructs few-shot tabular prompts using
in-context learning examples from structured biomedical data and finetunes
TableGPT2 using the parameter-efficient qLoRA adaption for a clinical binary
classification task of AD or cognitively normal (CN). The TAP-GPT framework
harnesses the powerful tabular understanding ability of TableGPT2 and the
encoded prior knowledge of LLMs to outperform more advanced general-purpose
LLMs and a tabular foundation model (TFM) developed for prediction tasks. To
our knowledge, this is the first application of LLMs to the prediction task
using tabular biomarker data, paving the way for future LLM-driven multi-agent
frameworks in biomedical informatics.

Conclusion: 研究为心理健康领域的语用推理提供了新视角，并展示了LLMs在该领域的潜力。

Abstract: There has been an increase in recent advancements in the explainability and
development of personalized chatbots for mental health. However, the reasoning
aspects for explainability and dialogue discourse have not been explored
previously for mental health. Hence, we are investigating the pragmatic
reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) in this domain. We
introduce P-ReMe dataset, and propose a modified definition for the pragmatic
phenomena of implicature (implied meaning) and presupposition (implicit
assumption) in mental health. Following the definition, we formulate two tasks
in implicature and one task in presupposition. To benchmark the dataset and the
presented tasks, we consider four models - Llama3.1, Mistral, MentaLLaMa, and
Qwen. The results of the experiments suggest that Mistral and Qwen show
substantial reasoning capabilities in the domain. In addition, we also propose

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前模型的不足，强调了改进数据集质量和多语言评估方法的必要性，推动了低资源语言NLP研究。

Abstract: Bengali is an underrepresented language in NLP research. However, it remains
a challenge due to its unique linguistic structure and computational
constraints. In this work, we systematically investigate the challenges that
hinder Bengali NLP performance by focusing on the absence of standardized
evaluation benchmarks. We then evaluated 10 recent open source Large Language
Models (LLMs) in 8 of the translated datasets and performed a comprehensive
error analysis to pinpoint their primary failure modes. Our findings reveal
consistent performance gaps for Bengali compared to English, particularly for
smaller models and specific model families like Mistral. We also identified
promising robustness in certain architectures, such as DeepSeek, that maintain
more stable performance across languages. Our analysis reveals an inverse
relationship between tokenization efficiency and LLM accuracy where models tend
to perform worse when inputs are excessively tokenized, whereas more efficient
\& concise tokenization results in improved performance. These findings
highlight critical areas where current models fall short and underscore the
need for improved dataset quality and evaluation methodologies tailored to
multilingual contexts. This work will catalyze further research on NLP for
underrepresented languages, helping to democratize access to advanced language
technologies worldwide. The code and dataset used in this research is publicly
available at https://github.com/BengaliAI/bn-llm-benchmark.

Motivation: 探索MoE模型中专家的重要性差异，揭示SEs在模型推理中的关键作用。

Method: 通过分析SEs的激活特性和修剪实验，评估其对模型性能的影响。

Result: SEs是模型性能的关键，修剪SEs会导致数学推理等任务表现显著下降。

Conclusion: SEs在MoE模型中扮演关键角色，其压缩会显著影响模型性能。

Abstract: Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have shown promise in
enhancing the learning capacity of large language models (LLMs). Leveraging the
intrinsic importance differences among experts, recent research has explored
expert-level compression techniques to improve the efficiency of MoE LLMs.
However, existing approaches often rely on empirical criteria to identify
critical experts, lacking a deeper exploration and understanding of the
heterogeneous importance of experts. In this study, we present the first
discovery and investigation of a distinct subset of experts that play a crucial
role in the underlying mechanisms during the model's forward inference. These
experts are prevalent in open-source MoE LLMs, and despite their limited
number, pruning them leads to a significant decline in model performance (e.g.,
pruning three causes Qwen3-30B-A3B to produce repetitive and uninformative
outputs). We refer to these experts as Super Experts (SEs). Our comprehensive
analysis provides progressively deeper insights into SEs. (i) SEs are
characterized by rare but extreme activation outliers in the output of the
down_proj, which give rise to massive activations in the hidden states between
decoder layers. Moreover, the distribution of SEs remains model-specific and is
unaffected by post-training processes. (ii) By pruning SEs, we assess their
significance across a variety of tasks, revealing their considerable impact on
the model's overall performance, particularly in mathematical reasoning. (iii)
We further enhance our understanding of the influence of SEs compression. Our
findings confirm that MoE LLMs rely on SEs to induce attention sinks, which are
crucial for the distribution of attention scores but are significantly
disrupted by SE pruning. The code is available at

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLMs）是否会在无明确训练的情况下隐式净化敏感内容。

Method: 通过实验分析GPT-4o-mini在改写敏感内容时的行为，并评估其敏感性变化。

Result: GPT-4o-mini能系统性地将内容净化至较低敏感类别，显著减少贬义和禁忌语言。

Conclusion: LLMs具备隐式净化能力，且在零样本分类任务中表现优于传统方法。

Abstract: Proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown tendencies toward
politeness, formality, and implicit content moderation. While previous research
has primarily focused on explicitly training models to moderate and detoxify
sensitive content, there has been limited exploration of whether LLMs
implicitly sanitize language without explicit instructions. This study
empirically analyzes the implicit moderation behavior of GPT-4o-mini when
paraphrasing sensitive content and evaluates the extent of sensitivity shifts.
Our experiments indicate that GPT-4o-mini systematically moderates content
toward less sensitive classes, with substantial reductions in derogatory and
taboo language. Also, we evaluate the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs in
classifying sentence sensitivity, comparing their performances against
traditional methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在多个领域表现优异，但由于训练数据中音乐相关知识的不足，其在音乐应用中的效果有限。

Method: 提出MusT-RAG框架，结合MusWikiDB音乐专用向量数据库，在推理和微调阶段利用上下文信息优化LLMs的音乐适应能力。

Result: MusT-RAG在音乐问答任务中显著优于传统微调方法，并在领域内外基准测试中表现一致提升；MusWikiDB比通用维基百科语料库更高效。

Conclusion: MusT-RAG框架和MusWikiDB数据库有效提升了LLMs在音乐领域的适应能力，为音乐相关应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains. While they exhibit strong
zero-shot performance on various tasks, LLMs' effectiveness in music-related
applications remains limited due to the relatively small proportion of
music-specific knowledge in their training data. To address this limitation, we
propose MusT-RAG, a comprehensive framework based on Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) to adapt general-purpose LLMs for text-only music question
answering (MQA) tasks. RAG is a technique that provides external knowledge to
LLMs by retrieving relevant context information when generating answers to
questions. To optimize RAG for the music domain, we (1) propose MusWikiDB, a
music-specialized vector database for the retrieval stage, and (2) utilizes
context information during both inference and fine-tuning processes to
effectively transform general-purpose LLMs into music-specific models. Our
experiment demonstrates that MusT-RAG significantly outperforms traditional
fine-tuning approaches in enhancing LLMs' music domain adaptation capabilities,
showing consistent improvements across both in-domain and out-of-domain MQA
benchmarks. Additionally, our MusWikiDB proves substantially more effective
than general Wikipedia corpora, delivering superior performance and
computational efficiency.

Motivation: LLMs依赖参数化知识，缺乏可解释性和可信度；TOD系统需要手动构建ontology，成本高。TeQoDO旨在通过无监督方法自动构建ontology，提升LLM的可解释性。

Method: TeQoDO结合LLM的SQL编程能力和对话理论，通过无监督方式从零构建TOD ontology。

Result: TeQoDO在对话状态跟踪任务中表现优于迁移学习方法，且能扩展到Wikipedia和ArXiv等大规模数据集。

Conclusion: TeQoDO为提升LLM的可解释性提供了新方向，展示了ontology在LLM中的潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as general-purpose knowledge
sources, but they rely on parametric knowledge, limiting explainability and
trustworthiness. In task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, this separation is
explicit, using an external database structured by an explicit ontology to
ensure explainability and controllability. However, building such ontologies
requires manual labels or supervised training. We introduce TeQoDO: a
Text-to-SQL task-oriented Dialogue Ontology construction method. Here, an LLM
autonomously builds a TOD ontology from scratch without supervision using its
inherent SQL programming capabilities combined with dialogue theory provided in
the prompt. We show that TeQoDO outperforms transfer learning approaches, and
its constructed ontology is competitive on a downstream dialogue state tracking
task. Ablation studies demonstrate the key role of dialogue theory. TeQoDO also
scales to allow construction of much larger ontologies, which we investigate on
a Wikipedia and ArXiv dataset. We view this as a step towards broader
application of ontologies to increase LLM explainability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了MPCC基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型在复杂约束下的规划能力，发现现有模型表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准无法直接评估多模态现实世界规划能力，且缺乏跨模态约束，因此需要MPCC来解决这些问题。

Method: MPCC通过三个现实任务（飞行、日历、会议规划）引入复杂约束（预算、时间、空间），并设置不同难度级别。

Result: 实验显示，闭源模型仅21.3%可行计划，开源模型低于11%，且模型对约束复杂度敏感。

Conclusion: MPCC为多模态约束规划提供了严格评估框架，凸显了约束感知推理在现实应用中的重要性。

Abstract: Multimodal planning capabilities refer to the ability to predict, reason, and
design steps for task execution with multimodal context, which is essential for
complex reasoning and decision-making across multiple steps. However, current
benchmarks face two key challenges: (1) they cannot directly assess multimodal
real-world planning capabilities, and (2) they lack constraints or implicit
constraints across modalities. To address these issues, we introduce Multimodal
Planning with Complex Constraints (MPCC), the first benchmark to systematically
evaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning. To
address the first challenge, MPCC focuses on three real-world tasks: Flight
Planning, Calendar Planning, and Meeting Planning. To solve the second
challenge, we introduce complex constraints (e.g. budget, temporal, and
spatial) in these tasks, with graded difficulty levels (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD) to
separate constraint complexity from search space expansion. Experiments on 13
advanced MLLMs reveal significant challenges: closed-source models achieve only
21.3% feasible plans, while open-source models average below 11%. Additionally,
we observe that MLLMs are highly sensitive to constraint complexity and that
traditional multimodal prompting strategies fail in multi-constraint scenarios.
Our work formalizes multimodal constraints in planning, provides a rigorous
evaluation framework, and highlights the need for advancements in
constraint-aware reasoning for real-world MLLM applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在去除因果注意力掩码时可能削弱LLMs的语义提取能力，且单向方法常需额外输入文本增加计算成本。

Method: 使用轻量级BERT式模型预编码输入文本为上下文标记，将其前置到LLM输入序列中，并拼接上下文和EOS标记的隐藏状态作为最终嵌入。

Result: 在MTEB基准测试中表现最佳，序列长度减少85%，推理时间减少82%。

Conclusion: Causal2Vec在不改变LLM架构或增加显著计算开销的情况下，显著提升了嵌入模型的性能。

Abstract: Decoder-only large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to build
embedding models that effectively encode the semantic information of natural
language texts into dense vector representations for various embedding tasks.
However, many existing methods primarily focus on removing the causal attention
mask in LLMs to enable bidirectional attention, potentially undermining the
model's ability to extract semantic information acquired during pretraining.
Additionally, leading unidirectional approaches often rely on extra input text
to overcome the inherent limitations of causal attention, inevitably increasing
computational costs. In this work, we propose Causal2Vec, a general-purpose
embedding model tailored to enhance the performance of decoder-only LLMs
without altering their original architectures or introducing significant
computational overhead. Specifically, we first employ a lightweight BERT-style
model to pre-encode the input text into a single Contextual token, which is
then prepended to the LLM's input sequence, allowing each token to capture
contextualized information even without attending to future tokens.
Furthermore, to mitigate the recency bias introduced by last-token pooling and
help LLMs better leverage the semantic information encoded in the Contextual
token, we concatenate the last hidden states of Contextual and EOS tokens as
the final text embedding. In practice, Causal2Vec achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB) among models
trained solely on publicly available retrieval datasets, while reducing the
required sequence length by up to 85% and inference time by up to 82% compared
to best-performing methods.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models presents both opportunities
and challenges for the translation field. While commercial, cloud-based AI
chatbots have garnered significant attention in translation studies, concerns
regarding data privacy, security, and equitable access necessitate exploration
of alternative deployment models. This paper investigates the feasibility and
performance of locally deployable, free language models as a viable alternative
to proprietary, cloud-based AI solutions. This study evaluates three
open-source models installed on CPU-based platforms and compared against
commercially available online chat-bots. The evaluation focuses on functional
performance rather than a comparative analysis of human-machine translation
quality, an area already subject to extensive research. The platforms assessed
were chosen for their accessibility and ease of use across various operating
systems. While local deployment introduces its own challenges, the benefits of
enhanced data control, improved privacy, and reduced dependency on cloud
services are compelling. The findings of this study contribute to a growing
body of knowledge concerning the democratization of AI technology and inform
future research and development efforts aimed at making LLMs more accessible
and practical for a wider range of users, specifically focusing on the needs of
individual translators and small businesses.

Motivation: 解决多文档摘要中关系复杂和信息冗余的问题，克服现有方法仅考虑单关系图和需预定义聚类数的限制。

Method: 构建多关系图整合语义和语篇关系，应用二维结构熵最小化算法自动聚类，引入位置感知压缩机制生成摘要。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优于现有无监督方法，部分情况下接近监督模型和大语言模型性能，人工评估显示摘要质量接近人类水平。

Conclusion: MRGSEM-Sum通过多关系图和结构熵最小化，有效提升了多文档摘要的一致性和覆盖性，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The core challenge faced by multi-document summarization is the complexity of
relationships among documents and the presence of information redundancy. Graph
clustering is an effective paradigm for addressing this issue, as it models the
complex relationships among documents using graph structures and reduces
information redundancy through clustering, achieving significant research
progress. However, existing methods often only consider single-relational
graphs and require a predefined number of clusters, which hinders their ability
to fully represent rich relational information and adaptively partition
sentence groups to reduce redundancy. To overcome these limitations, we propose
MRGSEM-Sum, an unsupervised multi-document summarization framework based on
multi-relational graphs and structural entropy minimization. Specifically, we
construct a multi-relational graph that integrates semantic and discourse
relations between sentences, comprehensively modeling the intricate and dynamic
connections among sentences across documents. We then apply a two-dimensional
structural entropy minimization algorithm for clustering, automatically
determining the optimal number of clusters and effectively organizing sentences
into coherent groups. Finally, we introduce a position-aware compression
mechanism to distill each cluster, generating concise and informative
summaries. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (Multi-News,
DUC-2004, PubMed, and WikiSum) demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms previous unsupervised methods and, in several cases, achieves
performance comparable to supervised models and large language models. Human
evaluation demonstrates that the summaries generated by MRGSEM-Sum exhibit high
consistency and coverage, approaching human-level quality.

and the coexistence of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various dialects.
Despite the growing global significance of Arabic, it is still underrepresented
in NLP research and benchmark resources. In this paper, we present an enhanced
Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) framework developed specifically for Arabic. At
the core of our approach is a novel Attentive Relevance Scoring (ARS) that
replaces standard interaction mechanisms with an adaptive scoring function that
more effectively models the semantic relevance between questions and passages.
Our method integrates pre-trained Arabic language models and architectural
refinements to improve retrieval performance and significantly increase ranking
accuracy when answering Arabic questions. The code is made publicly available

Motivation: 现有AI系统多采用被动批判性思维，仅拒绝问题查询而未能主动解决用户需求，因此需要发展主动批判性思维以提升协作能力。

Method: 提出主动批判性思维范式，设计GSM-MC和GSM-MCE两个基准测试，并利用强化学习（RL）优化模型表现。

Result: 实验显示，强化学习显著提升了模型在主动批判性思维任务上的表现，如Qwen3-1.7B在GSM-MC上的准确率从0.15%提升至73.98%。

Conclusion: 主动批判性思维能有效提升AI与用户协作解决问题的能力，强化学习是实现这一目标的有效方法。

Abstract: Critical thinking is essential for building robust AI systems, preventing
them from blindly accepting flawed data or biased reasoning. However, prior
work has primarily focused on passive critical thinking, where models simply
reject problematic queries without taking constructive steps to address user
requests. In this work, we introduce proactive critical thinking, a paradigm
where models actively seek missing or clarifying information from users to
resolve their queries better. To evaluate this capability, we present GSM-MC
and GSM-MCE, two novel benchmarks based on GSM8K for assessing mathematical
reasoning under incomplete or misleading conditions. GSM-MC contains 1,368 math
problems with a key variable deliberately removed, requiring models to identify
and request the missing information. GSM-MCE further increases the difficulty
by introducing irrelevant details to test robustness against distractions.
Experiments on Qwen3 and Llama series models show that, while these models
excel in traditional reasoning tasks due to extensive post-training and
inference-time scaling, they struggle with proactive critical thinking,
especially smaller ones. However, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning
(RL) can significantly improve this ability. Using our enhanced RL algorithm,
we achieve substantial gains, boosting the Qwen3-1.7B's accuracy from 0.15% to
73.98% on GSM-MC. We hope this work advances models that collaborate more
effectively with users in problem-solving through proactive critical thinking.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise
settings, controlling model behavior based on user roles becomes an essential
requirement. Existing safety methods typically assume uniform access and focus
on preventing harmful or toxic outputs, without addressing role-specific access
constraints. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can be fine-tuned to
generate responses that reflect the access privileges associated with different
organizational roles. We explore three modeling strategies: a BERT-based
classifier, an LLM-based classifier, and role-conditioned generation. To
evaluate these approaches, we construct two complementary datasets. The first
is adapted from existing instruction-tuning corpora through clustering and role
labeling, while the second is synthetically generated to reflect realistic,
role-sensitive enterprise scenarios. We assess model performance across varying
organizational structures and analyze robustness to prompt injection, role
mismatch, and jailbreak attempts.

Conclusion: CSEDB为LLMs临床评估提供标准化工具，有助于提升医疗环境中的安全性和有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise in clinical decision support but
face major challenges in safety evaluation and effectiveness validation. We
developed the Clinical Safety-Effectiveness Dual-Track Benchmark (CSEDB), a
multidimensional framework built on clinical expert consensus, encompassing 30
criteria covering critical areas like critical illness recognition, guideline
adherence, and medication safety, with weighted consequence measures.
Thirty-two specialist physicians developed and reviewed 2,069 open-ended Q&A
items aligned with these criteria, spanning 26 clinical departments to simulate
real-world scenarios. Benchmark testing of six LLMs revealed moderate overall
performance (average total score 57.2%, safety 54.7%, effectiveness 62.3%),
with a significant 13.3% performance drop in high-risk scenarios (p < 0.0001).
Domain-specific medical LLMs showed consistent performance advantages over
general-purpose models, with relatively higher top scores in safety (0.912) and
effectiveness (0.861). The findings of this study not only provide a
standardized metric for evaluating the clinical application of medical LLMs,
facilitating comparative analyses, risk exposure identification, and
improvement directions across different scenarios, but also hold the potential

Conclusion: Med-R³通过联合优化检索与推理能力，在医学领域实现了最先进的性能，展示了其解决复杂医学问题的潜力。

Abstract: In medical scenarios, effectively retrieving external knowledge and
leveraging it for rigorous logical reasoning is of significant importance.
Despite their potential, existing work has predominantly focused on enhancing
either retrieval or reasoning capabilities of the models in isolation, with
little attention given to their joint optimization, which leads to limited
coordination between the two processes. Additionally, current methods rely
heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which can cause models to memorize
existing problem-solving pathways, thereby restricting their generalization
ability when confronted with novel problem contexts. Furthermore, while some
studies have explored to improve retrieval-augmented reasoning in general
domains via reinforcement learning, their reward function designs do not
adequately capture the specific demands of the medical domain. To address these
challenges, we introduce **Med-R$^3$**, a **Med**ical **R**etrieval-augmented
**R**easoning framework driven by progressive **R**einforcement learning. In
this framework, we first develop the model's ability to perform logical
reasoning over medical problems. Subsequently, on the basis of this foundation,
we adaptively optimize the retrieval capability to better align with the
characteristics of knowledge corpus and external information utilization
throughout the reasoning process. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the
model's retrieval and reasoning coordination. Extensive experiments indicate
that **Med-R$^3$** could achieve state-of-the-art performances, with
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + Med-R$^3$ surpassing closed-sourced GPT-4o-mini by
3.93\% at a comparable parameter scale, while Qwen2.5-14B augmented with
Med-R$^3$ shows a more substantial gain of 13.53\%.

*Alva West,Luodan Zhang,Liuliu Zhang,Minjun Zhu,Yixuan Weng,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: T-Detect是一种新的文本检测方法，通过使用t分布替代高斯分布，提高了对对抗性文本的检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本检测器基于高斯分布的假设，无法有效处理对抗性或非英语文本的重尾统计特性。

Method: T-Detect采用t分布的重尾差异分数，通过归一化对数似然来生成检测分数。

Result: 在RAID和HART数据集上，T-Detect性能显著提升，AUROC最高提高3.9%。

Conclusion: T-Detect为文本检测提供了新的理论基础，并在对抗条件下表现出卓越的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The proliferation of sophisticated text generation models necessitates the
development of robust detection methods capable of identifying
machine-generated content, particularly text designed to evade detection
through adversarial perturbations. Existing zero-shot detectors often rely on
statistical measures that implicitly assume Gaussian distributions, a premise
that falters when confronted with the heavy-tailed statistical artifacts
characteristic of adversarial or non-native English texts. This paper
introduces T-Detect, a novel detection method that fundamentally redesigns the
statistical core of curvature-based detectors. Our primary innovation is the
replacement of standard Gaussian normalization with a heavy-tailed discrepancy
score derived from the Student's t-distribution. This approach is theoretically
grounded in the empirical observation that adversarial texts exhibit
significant leptokurtosis, rendering traditional statistical assumptions
inadequate. T-Detect computes a detection score by normalizing the
log-likelihood of a passage against the expected moments of a t-distribution,
providing superior resilience to statistical outliers. We validate our approach
on the challenging RAID benchmark for adversarial text and the comprehensive
HART dataset. Experiments show that T-Detect provides a consistent performance
uplift over strong baselines, improving AUROC by up to 3.9\% in targeted
domains. When integrated into a two-dimensional detection framework (CT), our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an AUROC of 0.926 on the
Books domain of RAID. Our contributions are a new, theoretically-justified
statistical foundation for text detection, an ablation-validated method that
demonstrates superior robustness, and a comprehensive analysis of its
performance under adversarial conditions. Ours code are released at

TL;DR: DiffLoRA是一种参数高效的自适应方法，结合了差分注意力和低秩适配器，在部分任务中表现优于LoRA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进Transformer模型的性能，通过差分注意力机制减少噪声，同时保持参数效率。

Method: 在正负注意力项上应用低秩适配器，结合差分注意力机制。

Result: 在大多数任务中表现不如其他参数高效微调方法，但在某些领域（如HumanEval）表现突出（+11分）。

Conclusion: DiffLoRA在特定任务中具有潜力，但需进一步分析其注意力模式以优化性能。

Abstract: Differential Transformer has recently been proposed to improve performance in
Transformer models by canceling out noise through a denoiser attention
mechanism. In this work, we introduce DiffLoRA, a parameter-efficient
adaptation of the differential attention mechanism, with low-rank adapters on
both positive and negative attention terms. This approach retains the
efficiency of LoRA while aiming to benefit from the performance gains of
differential attention. We evaluate DiffLoRA across a broad range of NLP tasks,
including general benchmarks, many-shot in-context learning, RAG, and
long-context tests. We observe that, although DiffLoRA falls short of other
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in most evaluation tasks, it shows
interesting results in certain domains (+11 pts on LoRA for HumanEval). We
analyze the attention patterns post-finetuning to identify the reasons for this
behavior.

Motivation: 近年来，社交媒体中的仇恨言论识别日益重要，研究旨在解决阿拉伯语文本中的仇恨言论检测与清理问题。

Method: 使用深度学习和Transformer模型进行仇恨言论检测，将文本清理任务视为机器翻译问题，输入为含仇恨言论的句子，输出为掩码后的句子。

Result: 仇恨言论检测模型达到92%的Macro F1分数和95%的准确率；文本清理模型在1-gram下BLEU分数为0.3。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在仇恨言论检测和清理任务中表现优异，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Hate speech identification in social media has become an increasingly
important issue in recent years. In this research, we address two problems: 1)
to detect hate speech in Arabic text, 2) to clean a given text from hate
speech. The meaning of cleaning here is replacing each bad word with stars
based on the number of letters for each word. Regarding the first problem, we
conduct several experiments using deep learning models and transformers to
determine the best model in terms of the F1 score. Regarding second problem, we
consider it as a machine translation task, where the input is a sentence
containing dirty text and the output is the same sentence with masking the
dirty text. The presented methods achieve the best model in hate speech
detection with a 92\% Macro F1 score and 95\% accuracy. Regarding the text
cleaning experiment, the best result in the hate speech masking model reached
0.3 in BLEU score with 1-gram, which is a good result compared with the state
of the art machine translation systems.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用大语言模型为知识图谱中的逻辑规则生成自然语言解释的潜力，通过多种提示策略和人工评估验证了其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升知识图谱的完整性和推理能力，同时解决逻辑规则因复杂性和独特标签难以理解的问题。

Method: 使用AMIE 3.5.1算法从FB15k-237等数据集中提取逻辑规则，并采用零样本、少样本提示及链式推理策略生成解释。

Result: 生成的解释在正确性和清晰度上表现良好，但仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在生成逻辑规则解释方面具有潜力，未来研究需进一步优化。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) often contain sufficient information to support the
inference of new facts. Identifying logical rules not only improves the
completeness of a knowledge graph but also enables the detection of potential
errors, reveals subtle data patterns, and enhances the overall capacity for
reasoning and interpretation. However, the complexity of such rules, combined
with the unique labeling conventions of each KG, can make them difficult for
humans to understand. In this paper, we explore the potential of large language
models to generate natural language explanations for logical rules.
Specifically, we extract logical rules using the AMIE 3.5.1 rule discovery
algorithm from the benchmark dataset FB15k-237 and two large-scale datasets,
FB-CVT-REV and FB+CVT-REV. We examine various prompting strategies, including
zero- and few-shot prompting, including variable entity types, and
chain-of-thought reasoning. We conduct a comprehensive human evaluation of the
generated explanations based on correctness, clarity, and hallucination, and
also assess the use of large language models as automatic judges. Our results
demonstrate promising performance in terms of explanation correctness and
clarity, although several challenges remain for future research. All scripts

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: QA基准测试是间接评估LLMs问题解决能力的方法，需要更直接且可推广的评估框架。

Method: 采用级联问题披露方法，分阶段揭示问题信息，以激发LLMs的泛化推理能力。

Result: 该方法不仅提供了更好的模型比较，还产生了更优的中间推理痕迹，缩小了标准QA评估中的性能差距。

Conclusion: 级联问题披露框架更准确地评估LLMs能力，表明标准QA评估可能高估模型间性能差异。

Abstract: While question-answering~(QA) benchmark performance is an automatic and
scalable method to compare LLMs, it is an indirect method of evaluating their
underlying problem-solving capabilities. Therefore, we propose a holistic and
generalizable framework based on \emph{cascaded question disclosure} that
provides a more accurate estimate of the models' problem-solving capabilities
while maintaining the scalability and automation. This approach collects model
responses in a stagewise manner with each stage revealing partial information
about the question designed to elicit generalized reasoning in LLMs. We find
that our approach not only provides a better comparison between LLMs, but also
induces better intermediate traces in models compared to the standard QA
paradigm. We empirically verify this behavior on diverse reasoning and
knowledge-heavy QA datasets by comparing LLMs of varying sizes and families.
Our approach narrows the performance gap observed in the standard QA evaluation
settings, indicating that the prevalent indirect QA paradigm of evaluation
overestimates the differences in performance between models. We further
validate our findings by extensive ablation studies.

TL;DR: NeuroAR是一种基于生成自回归变压器的新型脑老化模拟模型，通过自回归估计未来扫描的离散标记图，克服了数据高维性和个体特异性等挑战，显著优于现有生成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑老化合成在临床和计算神经科学中有广泛应用，但高维数据、细微结构变化和个体特异性模式是其合成的主要挑战。

Method: NeuroAR利用生成自回归变压器，通过自回归估计未来扫描的离散标记图，并结合先前的扫描和目标年龄进行引导生成。

Result: 在老年和青少年人群中，NeuroAR在图像保真度上优于现有生成模型（如LDM和GAN），并通过预训练年龄预测器验证了合成图像的一致性和真实性。

Conclusion: NeuroAR能够高保真地建模个体特异性脑老化轨迹，显著优于关键模型（如LDM）。

Abstract: Brain aging synthesis is a critical task with broad applications in clinical
and computational neuroscience. The ability to predict the future structural
evolution of a subject's brain from an earlier MRI scan provides valuable
insights into aging trajectories. Yet, the high-dimensionality of data, subtle
changes of structure across ages, and subject-specific patterns constitute
challenges in the synthesis of the aging brain. To overcome these challenges,
we propose NeuroAR, a novel brain aging simulation model based on generative
autoregressive transformers. NeuroAR synthesizes the aging brain by
autoregressively estimating the discrete token maps of a future scan from a
convenient space of concatenated token embeddings of a previous and future
scan. To guide the generation, it concatenates into each scale the subject's
previous scan, and uses its acquisition age and the target age at each block
via cross-attention. We evaluate our approach on both the elderly population
and adolescent subjects, demonstrating superior performance over
state-of-the-art generative models, including latent diffusion models (LDM) and
generative adversarial networks, in terms of image fidelity. Furthermore, we
employ a pre-trained age predictor to further validate the consistency and
realism of the synthesized images with respect to expected aging patterns.
NeuroAR significantly outperforms key models, including LDM, demonstrating its
ability to model subject-specific brain aging trajectories with high fidelity.

Motivation: 解决现有研究在语言覆盖、认知上下文和LLM参与粒度方面的不足，特别是在韩语环境下检测LLM辅助作弊的需求。

Method: 构建包含69名参与者的数据集，完成三种写作任务（真实写作、改写ChatGPT回答、转录ChatGPT回答），涵盖Bloom分类法中的六种认知过程。提取时间和节奏特征，并在认知感知和认知无感知设置下评估分类器。

Result: 时间特征在认知感知场景下表现良好，节奏特征在跨认知场景下泛化能力更强。模型在检测真实写作和转录回答时优于人类评估者，但在改写回答上仍有挑战。

Conclusion: 击键动态能可靠检测不同认知需求和写作策略下的LLM辅助写作，包括改写和转录LLM生成内容。

Abstract: This paper presents a keystroke-based framework for detecting LLM-assisted
cheating in Korean, addressing key gaps in prior research regarding language
coverage, cognitive context, and the granularity of LLM involvement. Our
proposed dataset includes 69 participants who completed writing tasks under
three conditions: Bona fide writing, paraphrasing ChatGPT responses, and
transcribing ChatGPT responses. Each task spans six cognitive processes defined
in Bloom's Taxonomy (remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate, and
create). We extract interpretable temporal and rhythmic features and evaluate
multiple classifiers under both Cognition-Aware and Cognition-Unaware settings.
Temporal features perform well under Cognition-Aware evaluation scenarios,
while rhythmic features generalize better under cross-cognition scenarios.
Moreover, detecting bona fide and transcribed responses was easier than
paraphrased ones for both the proposed models and human evaluators, with the
models significantly outperforming the humans. Our findings affirm that
keystroke dynamics facilitate reliable detection of LLM-assisted writing across
varying cognitive demands and writing strategies, including paraphrasing and
transcribing LLM-generated responses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLPs存在可解释性差、激活函数固定、难以捕捉局部或高频特征等问题，KANs能解决这些限制。

Method: 从数据驱动学习、物理信息建模和深度算子学习三个视角分类KANs的进展，比较其与MLPs的性能。

Result: KANs在准确性、收敛性和频谱表示上优于MLPs，能更有效捕捉复杂动态。

Conclusion: KANs仍有计算效率、理论保证等挑战，未来需提升其鲁棒性、可扩展性和物理一致性。

Abstract: The field of scientific machine learning, which originally utilized
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), is increasingly adopting Kolmogorov-Arnold
Networks (KANs) for data encoding. This shift is driven by the limitations of
MLPs, including poor interpretability, fixed activation functions, and
difficulty capturing localized or high-frequency features. KANs address these
issues with enhanced interpretability and flexibility, enabling more efficient
modeling of complex nonlinear interactions and effectively overcoming the
constraints associated with conventional MLP architectures. This review
categorizes recent progress in KAN-based models across three distinct
perspectives: (i) data-driven learning, (ii) physics-informed modeling, and
(iii) deep operator learning. Each perspective is examined through the lens of
architectural design, training strategies, application efficacy, and
comparative evaluation against MLP-based counterparts. By benchmarking KANs
against MLPs, we highlight consistent improvements in accuracy, convergence,
and spectral representation, clarifying KANs' advantages in capturing complex
dynamics while learning more effectively. Finally, this review identifies
critical challenges and open research questions in KAN development,
particularly regarding computational efficiency, theoretical guarantees,
hyperparameter tuning, and algorithm complexity. We also outline future
research directions aimed at improving the robustness, scalability, and
physical consistency of KAN-based frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单灾害预测方法无法捕捉复杂气候事件的交互作用，气候变化加剧了农业风险，需要智能化的持续学习系统。

Method: 结合序列深度学习模型（如BiLSTM）和可解释AI技术（如TimeSHAP），构建多灾害预测框架，并利用美国四个农业区的气象数据验证。

Result: 实验结果显示框架预测准确性高，尤其是BiLSTM架构，并能提供详细的时间解释。

Conclusion: 该研究显著提升了多灾害预警系统的可解释性和实用性，支持农业气候风险管理的有效决策。

Abstract: Climate extremes present escalating risks to agriculture intensifying the
need for reliable multi-hazard early warning systems (EWS). The situation is
evolving due to climate change and hence such systems should have the
intelligent to continue to learn from recent climate behaviours. However,
traditional single-hazard forecasting methods fall short in capturing complex
interactions among concurrent climatic events. To address this deficiency, in
this paper, we combine sequential deep learning models and advanced Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to introduce a multi-hazard
forecasting framework for agriculture. In our experiments, we utilize
meteorological data from four prominent agricultural regions in the United
States (between 2010 and 2023) to validate the predictive accuracy of our
framework on multiple severe event types, which are extreme cold, floods,
frost, hail, heatwaves, and heavy rainfall, with tailored models for each area.
The framework uniquely integrates attention mechanisms with TimeSHAP (a
recurrent XAI explainer for time series) to provide comprehensive temporal
explanations revealing not only which climatic features are influential but
precisely when their impacts occur. Our results demonstrate strong predictive
accuracy, particularly with the BiLSTM architecture, and highlight the system's
capacity to inform nuanced, proactive risk management strategies. This research
significantly advances the explainability and applicability of multi-hazard
EWS, fostering interdisciplinary trust and effective decision-making process
for climate risk management in the agricultural industry.

Motivation: 心血管疾病每年导致全球1700多万人死亡，亟需隐私保护的预测系统。

Method: FedCVD++集成了逻辑回归、SVM、神经网络等参数化模型和随机森林、XGBoost等非参数化模型，提出了树子集采样、XGBoost特征提取和联邦SMOTE同步等方法。

Result: 在Framingham数据集上，FedCVD++的联邦XGBoost（F1=0.80）优于集中式方法（F1=0.78），随机森林（F1=0.81）与非联邦性能相当，通信效率策略减少了3.2倍带宽消耗。

Conclusion: FedCVD++首次将非参数化模型成功集成到联邦医疗系统中，提供了隐私保护的解决方案，并在实际临床约束下验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) cause over 17 million deaths annually
worldwide, highlighting the urgent need for privacy-preserving predictive
systems. We introduce FedCVD++, an enhanced federated learning (FL) framework
that integrates both parametric models (logistic regression, SVM, neural
networks) and non-parametric models (Random Forest, XGBoost) for coronary heart
disease risk prediction. To address key FL challenges, we propose: (1)
tree-subset sampling that reduces Random Forest communication overhead by 70%,
(2) XGBoost-based feature extraction enabling lightweight federated ensembles,
and (3) federated SMOTE synchronization for resolving cross-institutional class
imbalance.
  Evaluated on the Framingham dataset (4,238 records), FedCVD++ achieves
state-of-the-art results: federated XGBoost (F1 = 0.80) surpasses its
centralized counterpart (F1 = 0.78), and federated Random Forest (F1 = 0.81)
matches non-federated performance. Additionally, our communication-efficient
strategies reduce bandwidth consumption by 3.2X while preserving 95% accuracy.
  Compared to existing FL frameworks, FedCVD++ delivers up to 15% higher
F1-scores and superior scalability for multi-institutional deployment. This
work represents the first practical integration of non-parametric models into
federated healthcare systems, providing a privacy-preserving solution validated
under real-world clinical constraints.

Motivation: 随着极端高温事件的加剧，城市需要高效且可扩展的工具来评估和缓解热应力，传统物理模型计算成本高，难以推广。

Method: 提出GSM-UTCI框架，融合地表形态、土地覆盖数据和气象条件，采用FiLM架构动态调整空间特征，基于SOLWEIG数据训练。

Result: 模型精度高（R2=0.9151，MAE=0.41°C），计算时间从几小时缩短至五分钟，应用于费城绿化场景显示显著降温效果。

Conclusion: GSM-UTCI是一种可扩展的精细决策支持工具，适用于城市气候适应规划，能高效评估绿化策略效果。

Abstract: As extreme heat events intensify due to climate change and urbanization,
cities face increasing challenges in mitigating outdoor heat stress. While
traditional physical models such as SOLWEIG and ENVI-met provide detailed
assessments of human-perceived heat exposure, their computational demands limit
scalability for city-wide planning. In this study, we propose GSM-UTCI, a
multimodal deep learning framework designed to predict daytime average
Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) at 1-meter hyperlocal resolution. The
model fuses surface morphology (nDSM), high-resolution land cover data, and
hourly meteorological conditions using a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM)
architecture that dynamically conditions spatial features on atmospheric
context. Trained on SOLWEIG-derived UTCI maps, GSM-UTCI achieves near-physical
accuracy, with an R2 of 0.9151 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.41{\deg}C,
while reducing inference time from hours to under five minutes for an entire
city. To demonstrate its planning relevance, we apply GSM-UTCI to simulate
systematic landscape transformation scenarios in Philadelphia, replacing bare
earth, grass, and impervious surfaces with tree canopy. Results show spatially
heterogeneous but consistently strong cooling effects, with impervious-to-tree
conversion producing the highest aggregated benefit (-4.18{\deg}C average
change in UTCI across 270.7 km2). Tract-level bivariate analysis further
reveals strong alignment between thermal reduction potential and land cover
proportions. These findings underscore the utility of GSM-UTCI as a scalable,
fine-grained decision support tool for urban climate adaptation, enabling
scenario-based evaluation of greening strategies across diverse urban
environments.

Conclusion: 呼吁停止使用人类测试评估AI，开发针对AI的专用评估框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a range of
standardized tests originally designed to assess human cognitive and
psychological traits, such as intelligence and personality. While these results
are often interpreted as strong evidence of human-like characteristics in LLMs,
this paper argues that such interpretations constitute an ontological error.
Human psychological and educational tests are theory-driven measurement
instruments, calibrated to a specific human population. Applying these tests to
non-human subjects without empirical validation, risks mischaracterizing what
is being measured. Furthermore, a growing trend frames AI performance on
benchmarks as measurements of traits such as ``intelligence'', despite known
issues with validity, data contamination, cultural bias and sensitivity to
superficial prompt changes. We argue that interpreting benchmark performance as
measurements of human-like traits, lacks sufficient theoretical and empirical
justification. This leads to our position: Stop Evaluating AI with Human Tests,
Develop Principled, AI-specific Tests instead. We call for the development of
principled, AI-specific evaluation frameworks tailored to AI systems. Such
frameworks might build on existing frameworks for constructing and validating
psychometrics tests, or could be created entirely from scratch to fit the
unique context of AI.

Conclusion: 多模态潜在空间缺乏稳健逆向映射的结构，需进一步研究开发语义丰富且可逆的空间。

Abstract: This paper investigates the inverse capabilities and broader utility of
multimodal latent spaces within task-specific AI (Artificial Intelligence)
models. While these models excel at their designed forward tasks (e.g.,
text-to-image generation, audio-to-text transcription), their potential for
inverse mappings remains largely unexplored. We propose an optimization-based
framework to infer input characteristics from desired outputs, applying it
bidirectionally across Text-Image (BLIP, Flux.1-dev) and Text-Audio
(Whisper-Large-V3, Chatterbox-TTS) modalities.
  Our central hypothesis posits that while optimization can guide models
towards inverse tasks, their multimodal latent spaces will not consistently
support semantically meaningful and perceptually coherent inverse mappings.
Experimental results consistently validate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that
while optimization can force models to produce outputs that align textually
with targets (e.g., a text-to-image model generating an image that an image
captioning model describes correctly, or an ASR model transcribing optimized
audio accurately), the perceptual quality of these inversions is chaotic and
incoherent. Furthermore, when attempting to infer the original semantic input
from generative models, the reconstructed latent space embeddings frequently
lack semantic interpretability, aligning with nonsensical vocabulary tokens.
  These findings highlight a critical limitation. multimodal latent spaces,
primarily optimized for specific forward tasks, do not inherently possess the
structure required for robust and interpretable inverse mappings. Our work
underscores the need for further research into developing truly semantically
rich and invertible multimodal latent spaces.

Conclusion: KLLM有效解决了LLM推理中的量化问题，显著提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference poses significant challenges due to its
intensive memory and computation demands. Weight and activation quantization
(WAQ) offers a promising solution by reducing both memory footprint and
arithmetic complexity. However, two key challenges remain in the existing WAQ
designs. (1) Traditional WAQ designs rely on uniform integer-based quantization
for hardware efficiency, but this often results in significant accuracy
degradation at low precision. K-Means-based quantization, a non-uniform
quantization technique, achieves higher accuracy by matching the Gaussian-like
distributions of weights and activations in LLMs. However, its non-uniform
nature prevents direct execution on low-precision compute units, requiring
dequantization and floating-point matrix multiplications (MatMuls) during
inference. (2) Activation outliers further hinder effective low-precision WAQ.
Offline thresholding methods for outlier detection can lead to significant
model performance degradation, while existing online detection techniques
introduce substantial runtime overhead.
  To address the aforementioned challenges and fully unleash the potential of
WAQ with K-Means quantization for LLM inference, in this paper, we propose
KLLM, a hardware-software co-design framework. KLLM features an index-based
computation scheme for efficient execution of MatMuls and nonlinear operations
on K-Means-quantized data, which avoids most of the dequantization and
full-precision computations. Moreover, KLLM incorporates a novel outlier
detection engine, Orizuru, that efficiently identifies the top-$k$ largest and
smallest elements in the activation data stream during online inference.
  Extensive experiments show that, on average, KLLM achieves speedups of 9.67x,
7.03x and energy efficiency improvements of 229.50x, 150.21x compared to the
A100 GPU and Atom, respectively.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合行为分析和Granger因果关系的方法，用于分析时间序列数据中的因果关系，揭示个体行为对流程绩效的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法使用静态聚合数据，忽略了时间动态和个体行为对流程结果的影响，导致无法准确捕捉现实流程的复杂性。

Method: 整合行为分析与Granger因果关系，利用Group Lasso选择滞后项，分析时间序列数据中的因果关系。

Result: 发现一小部分但具有持续影响力的滞后项，表明个体行为对流程绩效（如吞吐时间）有直接可测量的影响。

Conclusion: 基于时间序列的行为分析方法能够更细致地揭示个体行为对流程效率的影响，为流程优化提供了新视角。

Abstract: Understanding how actor behavior influences process outcomes is a critical
aspect of process mining. Traditional approaches often use aggregate and static
process data, overlooking the temporal and causal dynamics that arise from
individual actor behavior. This limits the ability to accurately capture the
complexity of real-world processes, where individual actor behavior and
interactions between actors significantly shape performance. In this work, we
address this gap by integrating actor behavior analysis with Granger causality
to identify correlating links in time series data. We apply this approach to
realworld event logs, constructing time series for actor interactions, i.e.
continuation, interruption, and handovers, and process outcomes. Using Group
Lasso for lag selection, we identify a small but consistently influential set
of lags that capture the majority of causal influence, revealing that actor
behavior has direct and measurable impacts on process performance, particularly
throughput time. These findings demonstrate the potential of actor-centric,
time series-based methods for uncovering the temporal dependencies that drive
process outcomes, offering a more nuanced understanding of how individual
behaviors impact overall process efficiency.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种机器学习模型，利用ICU常规数据预测万古霉素相关肌酐升高，具有高准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 万古霉素是ICU中治疗严重革兰氏阳性感染的关键抗生素，但具有高肾毒性风险，早期预测肾功能损伤具有挑战性。

Method: 研究分析了10,288名ICU患者的MIMIC-IV数据库数据，使用SelectKBest和随机森林排名选择特征，测试了六种算法，并通过SHAP、ALE和贝叶斯后验采样评估可解释性。

Result: CatBoost表现最佳（AUROC 0.818），关键预测因子包括磷酸盐、总胆红素、镁、Charlson指数和APSIII。

Conclusion: 该模型能够从ICU常规数据中高精度预测万古霉素相关肌酐升高，支持早期风险检测和及时干预。

Abstract: Background: Vancomycin, a key antibiotic for severe Gram-positive infections
in ICUs, poses a high nephrotoxicity risk. Early prediction of kidney injury in
critically ill patients is challenging. This study aimed to develop a machine
learning model to predict vancomycin-related creatinine elevation using routine
ICU data.
  Methods: We analyzed 10,288 ICU patients (aged 18-80) from the MIMIC-IV
database who received vancomycin. Kidney injury was defined by KDIGO criteria
(creatinine rise >=0.3 mg/dL within 48h or >=50% within 7d). Features were
selected via SelectKBest (top 30) and Random Forest ranking (final 15). Six
algorithms were tested with 5-fold cross-validation. Interpretability was
evaluated using SHAP, Accumulated Local Effects (ALE), and Bayesian posterior
sampling.
  Results: Of 10,288 patients, 2,903 (28.2%) developed creatinine elevation.
CatBoost performed best (AUROC 0.818 [95% CI: 0.801-0.834], sensitivity 0.800,
specificity 0.681, negative predictive value 0.900). Key predictors were
phosphate, total bilirubin, magnesium, Charlson index, and APSIII. SHAP
confirmed phosphate as a major risk factor. ALE showed dose-response patterns.
Bayesian analysis estimated mean risk 60.5% (95% credible interval: 16.8-89.4%)
in high-risk cases.
  Conclusions: This machine learning model predicts vancomycin-associated
creatinine elevation from routine ICU data with strong accuracy and
interpretability, enabling early risk detection and supporting timely
interventions in critical care.

Abstract: This work investigates the impact of ensuring local differential privacy in
the thresholding bandit problem. We consider both the fixed budget and fixed
confidence settings. We propose methods that utilize private responses,
obtained through a Bernoulli-based differentially private mechanism, to
identify arms with expected rewards exceeding a predefined threshold. We show
that this procedure provides strong privacy guarantees and derive theoretical
performance bounds on the proposed algorithms. Additionally, we present general
lower bounds that characterize the additional loss incurred by any
differentially private mechanism, and show that the presented algorithms match
these lower bounds up to poly-logarithmic factors. Our results provide valuable
insights into privacy-preserving decision-making frameworks in bandit problems.

Result: 模型在多种材料和任务中表现优异，泛化能力强，仅需少量数据即可适应新任务或材料。

Conclusion: 该模型为断裂预测提供了统一、可扩展的解决方案，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Accurately predicting when and how materials fail is critical to designing
safe, reliable structures, mechanical systems, and engineered components that
operate under stress. Yet, fracture behavior remains difficult to model across
the diversity of materials, geometries, and loading conditions in real-world
applications. While machine learning (ML) methods show promise, most models are
trained on narrow datasets, lack robustness, and struggle to generalize.
Meanwhile, physics-based simulators offer high-fidelity predictions but are
fragmented across specialized methods and require substantial high-performance
computing resources to explore the input space. To address these limitations,
we present a data-driven foundation model for fracture prediction, a
transformer-based architecture that operates across simulators, a wide range of
materials (including plastic-bonded explosives, steel, aluminum, shale, and
tungsten), and diverse loading conditions. The model supports both structured
and unstructured meshes, combining them with large language model embeddings of
textual input decks specifying material properties, boundary conditions, and
solver settings. This multimodal input design enables flexible adaptation
across simulation scenarios without changes to the model architecture. The
trained model can be fine-tuned with minimal data on diverse downstream tasks,
including time-to-failure estimation, modeling fracture evolution, and adapting
to combined finite-discrete element method simulations. It also generalizes to
unseen materials such as titanium and concrete, requiring as few as a single
sample, dramatically reducing data needs compared to standard ML. Our results
show that fracture prediction can be unified under a single model architecture,
offering a scalable, extensible alternative to simulator-specific workflows.

Conclusion: 本研究为边缘AI部署提供了设备与模型选择的依据，优化了性能与能耗的平衡。

Abstract: The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its cutting-edge
AI-enabled applications (e.g., autonomous vehicles and smart industries)
combine two paradigms: data-driven systems and their deployment on the edge.
Usually, edge devices perform inferences to support latency-critical
applications. In addition to the performance of these resource-constrained edge
devices, their energy usage is a critical factor in adopting and deploying edge
applications. Examples of such devices include Raspberry Pi (RPi), Intel Neural
Compute Stick (INCS), NVIDIA Jetson nano (NJn), and Google Coral USB (GCU).
Despite their adoption in edge deployment for AI inferences, there is no study
on their performance and energy usage for informed decision-making on the
device and model selection to meet the demands of applications. This study
fills the gap by rigorously characterizing the performance of traditional,
neural networks, and large language models on the above-edge devices.
Specifically, we analyze trade-offs among model F1 score, inference time,
inference power, and memory usage. Hardware and framework optimization, along
with external parameter tuning of AI models, can balance between model
performance and resource usage to realize practical edge AI deployments.

Motivation: 加权图在生物学、化学和社会科学中普遍存在，但现有深度生成模型难以处理加权图或未考虑权重与拓扑的联合分布。

Method: BiGG-E通过自回归方法学习加权图的联合分布，并利用稀疏性在O((n + m)log n)时间内生成图。

Result: 实验表明，BiGG-E能更好地捕捉加权图分布，且具有可扩展性和计算效率。

Conclusion: BiGG-E为加权图生成提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Weighted graphs are ubiquitous throughout biology, chemistry, and the social
sciences, motivating the development of generative models for abstract weighted
graph data using deep neural networks. However, most current deep generative
models are either designed for unweighted graphs and are not easily extended to
weighted topologies or incorporate edge weights without consideration of a
joint distribution with topology. Furthermore, learning a distribution over
weighted graphs must account for complex nonlocal dependencies between both the
edges of the graph and corresponding weights of each edge. We develop an
autoregressive model BiGG-E, a nontrivial extension of the BiGG model, that
learns a joint distribution over weighted graphs while still exploiting
sparsity to generate a weighted graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges in $O((n +
m)\log n)$ time. Simulation studies and experiments on a variety of benchmark
datasets demonstrate that BiGG-E best captures distributions over weighted
graphs while remaining scalable and computationally efficient.

Conclusion: FLOSS能有效缓解数据缺失问题，提升联邦学习的性能。

Abstract: Previous work on data privacy in federated learning systems focuses on
privacy-preserving operations for data from users who have agreed to share
their data for training. However, modern data privacy agreements also empower
users to use the system while opting out of sharing their data as desired. When
combined with stragglers that arise from heterogeneous device capabilities, the
result is missing data from a variety of sources that introduces bias and
degrades model performance. In this paper, we present FLOSS, a system that
mitigates the impacts of such missing data on federated learning in the
presence of stragglers and user opt-out, and empirically demonstrate its
performance in simulations.

Abstract: Although prior work in computer vision has shown strong correlations between
in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracies, such
relationships remain underexplored in audio-based models. In this study, we
investigate how training conditions and input features affect the robustness
and generalization abilities of spoken keyword classifiers under OOD
conditions. We benchmark several neural architectures across a variety of
evaluation sets. To quantify the impact of noise on generalization, we make use
of two metrics: Fairness (F), which measures overall accuracy gains compared to
a baseline model, and Robustness (R), which assesses the convergence between ID
and OOD performance. Our results suggest that noise-aware training improves
robustness in some configurations. These findings shed new light on the
benefits and limitations of noise-based augmentation for generalization in
speech models.

Conclusion: 通过遗憾度量可以识别和缓解预测任意性，从而提升模型的安全性和可解释性。

Abstract: Many prediction tasks can admit multiple models that can perform almost
equally well. This phenomenon can can undermine interpretability and safety
when competing models assign conflicting predictions to individuals. In this
work, we study how arbitrariness can arise in probabilistic classification
tasks as a result of an effect that we call \emph{observational multiplicity}.
We discuss how this effect arises in a broad class of practical applications
where we learn a classifier to predict probabilities $p_i \in [0,1]$ but are
given a dataset of observations $y_i \in \{0,1\}$. We propose to evaluate the
arbitrariness of individual probability predictions through the lens of
\emph{regret}. We introduce a measure of regret for probabilistic
classification tasks, which measures how the predictions of a model could
change as a result of different training labels change. We present a
general-purpose method to estimate the regret in a probabilistic classification
task. We use our measure to show that regret is higher for certain groups in
the dataset and discuss potential applications of regret. We demonstrate how
estimating regret promote safety in real-world applications by abstention and
data collection.

Conclusion: 该工作使AI求解DEs在自然和工程领域真正可用。

Abstract: Many problems are governed by differential equations (DEs). Artificial
intelligence (AI) is a new path for solving DEs. However, data is very scarce
and existing AI solvers struggle with approximation of high frequency
components (AHFC). We propose an AI paradigm for solving diverse DEs, including
DE-ruled first-principles data generation methodology and scale-dilation
operator (SDO) AI solver. Using either prior knowledge or random fields, we
generate solutions and then substitute them into the DEs to derive the sources
and initial/boundary conditions through balancing DEs, thus producing
arbitrarily vast amount of, first-principles-consistent training datasets at
extremely low computational cost. We introduce a reversible SDO that leverages
the Fourier transform of the multiscale solutions to fix AHFC, and design a
spatiotemporally coupled, attention-based Transformer AI solver of DEs with
SDO. An upper bound on the Hessian condition number of the loss function is
proven to be proportional to the squared 2-norm of the solution gradient,
revealing that SDO yields a smoother loss landscape, consequently fixing AHFC
with efficient training. Extensive tests on diverse DEs demonstrate that our AI
paradigm achieves consistently superior accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.
This work makes AI solver of DEs to be truly usable in broad nature and
engineering fields.

Conclusion: FuseTen是首个能以10米分辨率生成每日LST的非线性方法，为解决气候相关问题提供了新工具。

Abstract: Urban heatwaves, droughts, and land degradation are pressing and growing
challenges in the context of climate change. A valuable approach to studying
them requires accurate spatio-temporal information on land surface conditions.
One of the most important variables for assessing and understanding these
phenomena is Land Surface Temperature (LST), which is derived from satellites
and provides essential information about the thermal state of the Earth's
surface. However, satellite platforms inherently face a trade-off between
spatial and temporal resolutions. To bridge this gap, we propose FuseTen, a
novel generative framework that produces daily LST observations at a fine 10 m
spatial resolution by fusing spatio-temporal observations derived from
Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS. FuseTen employs a generative
architecture trained using an averaging-based supervision strategy grounded in
physical principles. It incorporates attention and normalization modules within
the fusion process and uses a PatchGAN discriminator to enforce realism.
Experiments across multiple dates show that FuseTen outperforms linear
baselines, with an average 32.06% improvement in quantitative metrics and
31.42% in visual fidelity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
non-linear method to generate daily LST estimates at such fine spatial
resolution.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统有限差分法在检测黑盒函数稀疏性时存在假阴性问题，导致梯度计算错误且难以诊断。

Method: 通过系统性地用NaN污染输入并观察输出的NaN传播，重建保守的稀疏模式，消除假阴性。

Result: 在航空航天机翼重量模型中，实现了1.52倍加速，并检测到传统方法遗漏的依赖关系。

Conclusion: NaN-propagation方法利用IEEE 754标准，无需修改现有黑盒代码即可跨语言和数学库工作，显著提升稀疏性检测效率。

Abstract: Sparsity detection in black-box functions enables significant computational
speedups in gradient-based optimization through Jacobian compression, but
existing finite-difference methods suffer from false negatives due to
coincidental zero gradients. These false negatives can silently corrupt
gradient calculations, leading to difficult-to-diagnose errors. We introduce
NaN-propagation, which exploits the universal contamination property of IEEE
754 Not-a-Number floating-point values to trace input-output dependencies
through floating-point numerical computations. By systematically contaminating
inputs with NaN and observing which outputs become NaN, the method reconstructs
conservative sparsity patterns that eliminate false negatives. We demonstrate
the approach on an aerospace wing weight model, achieving a 1.52x speedup while
detecting dozens of dependencies missed by conventional methods -- a
significant improvement since gradient computation is the bottleneck in many
optimization workflows. The technique leverages IEEE 754 compliance to work
across programming languages and math libraries without modifying existing
black-box codes. Advanced strategies including NaN payload encoding enable
faster-than-linear time complexity, improving upon existing black-box sparsity
detection methods. Practical algorithms are also proposed to mitigate
challenges from branching code execution common in engineering applications.

Conclusion: DocsRay无需额外训练即可高效处理复杂多模态文档，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Understanding complex multimodal documents remains challenging due to their
structural inconsistencies and limited training data availability. We introduce
\textit{DocsRay}, a training-free document understanding system that integrates
pseudo Table of Contents (TOC) generation with hierarchical Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG). Our approach leverages multimodal Large Language Models'
(LLMs) native capabilities to seamlessly process documents containing diverse
elements such as text, images, charts, and tables without requiring specialized
models or additional training. DocsRay's framework synergistically combines
three key techniques: (1) a semantic structuring module using prompt-based LLM
interactions to generate a hierarchical pseudo-TOC, (2) zero-shot multimodal
analysis that converts diverse document elements into unified, text-centric
representations using the inherent capabilities of multimodal LLMs, and (3) an
efficient two-stage hierarchical retrieval system that reduces retrieval
complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(S + k_1 \cdot N_s)$. Evaluated on documents
averaging 49.4 pages and 20,971 textual tokens, DocsRay reduced query latency
from 3.89 to 2.12 seconds, achieving a 45% efficiency improvement. On the
MMLongBench-Doc benchmark, DocsRay-Pro attains an accuracy of 64.7%,
substantially surpassing previous state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了内部低维幻觉跟踪机制，与特定MLP子电路相关，可用于检测和缓解幻觉。

Abstract: Contextual hallucinations -- statements unsupported by given context --
remain a significant challenge in AI. We demonstrate a practical
interpretability insight: a generator-agnostic observer model detects
hallucinations via a single forward pass and a linear probe on its residual
stream. This probe isolates a single, transferable linear direction separating
hallucinated from faithful text, outperforming baselines by 5-27 points and
showing robust mid-layer performance across Gemma-2 models (2B to 27B).
Gradient-times-activation localises this signal to sparse, late-layer MLP
activity. Critically, manipulating this direction causally steers generator
hallucination rates, proving its actionability. Our results offer novel
evidence of internal, low-dimensional hallucination tracking linked to specific
MLP sub-circuits, exploitable for detection and mitigation. We release the
2000-example ContraTales benchmark for realistic assessment of such solutions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于增量学习视角的高效机器遗忘算法（IAU），解决了传统基于影响的遗忘方法计算开销大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着隐私问题日益突出，机器遗忘（让模型“忘记”特定训练数据）需求增加，但现有方法（如基于影响的遗忘）因计算Hessian矩阵及其逆矩阵而效率低下。

Method: 通过建立记忆（增量学习）与遗忘（机器遗忘）的理论联系，提出IAU算法，利用增量学习的高效梯度优化实现遗忘。

Result: IAU在多种数据集和模型架构上表现优异，平衡了遗忘保证、效率和模型性能。

Conclusion: IAU为大规模模型和频繁数据删除场景提供了一种高效且实用的机器遗忘解决方案。

Abstract: Due to growing privacy concerns, machine unlearning, which aims at enabling
machine learning models to ``forget" specific training data, has received
increasing attention. Among existing methods, influence-based unlearning has
emerged as a prominent approach due to its ability to estimate the impact of
individual training samples on model parameters without retraining. However,
this approach suffers from prohibitive computational overhead arising from the
necessity to compute the Hessian matrix and its inverse across all training
samples and parameters, rendering it impractical for large-scale models and
scenarios involving frequent data deletion requests. This highlights the
difficulty of forgetting. Inspired by cognitive science, which suggests that
memorizing is easier than forgetting, this paper establishes a theoretical link
between memorizing (incremental learning) and forgetting (unlearning). This
connection allows machine unlearning to be addressed from the perspective of
incremental learning. Unlike the time-consuming Hessian computations in
unlearning (forgetting), incremental learning (memorizing) typically relies on
more efficient gradient optimization, which supports the aforementioned
cognitive theory. Based on this connection, we introduce the Influence
Approximation Unlearning (IAU) algorithm for efficient machine unlearning from
the incremental perspective. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that
IAU achieves a superior balance among removal guarantee, unlearning efficiency,
and comparable model utility, while outperforming state-of-the-art methods
across diverse datasets and model architectures. Our code is available at

*Hui Yi Leong,Yuqing Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DynaSwarm 是一个动态多智能体系统框架，通过强化学习和动态图选择优化协作结构，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体系统框架依赖静态协作图结构，限制了适应性和性能。

Method: 提出 DynaSwarm，结合 A2C 强化学习机制和动态图选择器，通过参数高效微调优化结构。

Result: 在问答、数学推理和编程任务中，DynaSwarm 优于现有单智能体和多智能体基线。

Conclusion: 样本感知的结构灵活性对多智能体系统设计至关重要。

Abstract: Current multi-agent systems (MAS) frameworks often rely on manually designed
and static collaboration graph structures, limiting adaptability and
performance. To address these limitations, we propose DynaSwarm, a dynamic
framework that enhances LLM-based MAS through two key innovations: (1) an
actor-critic reinforcement learning (A2C) mechanism to optimize graph
structures with improved stability over prior RL methods, and (2) a dynamic
graph selector that adaptively chooses the optimal graph structure for each
input sample via parameter-efficient LLM fine-tuning. DynaSwarm eliminates the
need for rigid, one-fits-all graph architectures, instead leveraging
sample-specific idiosyncrasies to dynamically route queries through specialized
agent networks. (c) We propose to fine-tune the demonstration retriever to
fully exploit the power of in-context learning (ICL). Extensive experiments on
question answering, mathematical reasoning, and coding tasks demonstrate that
DynaSwarm consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-agent and MAS
baselines across multiple LLM backbones. Our findings highlight the importance
of sample-aware structural flexibility in LLM MAS designs.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种动态分析框架，用于在训练过程中量化隐私泄露动态，揭示了样本隐私风险与其学习难度之间的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度学习中训练数据的隐私问题，尤其是成员推理攻击（MIAs）的威胁，探讨模型在训练过程中如何编码成员信息。

Method: 通过跟踪训练过程中每个样本在FPR-TPR平面上的脆弱性，分析数据集复杂性、模型架构和优化器选择等因素对隐私泄露的影响。

Result: 发现样本的隐私风险与其内在学习难度高度相关，且高度脆弱样本的隐私风险在训练早期就已确定。

Conclusion: 研究结果为理解隐私风险在训练中的动态出现提供了基础，支持开发隐私感知的模型训练策略。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) pose a critical threat to the privacy of
training data in deep learning. Despite significant progress in attack
methodologies, our understanding of when and how models encode membership
information during training remains limited. This paper presents a dynamic
analytical framework for dissecting and quantifying privacy leakage dynamics at
the individual sample level. By tracking per-sample vulnerabilities on an
FPR-TPR plane throughout training, our framework systematically measures how
factors such as dataset complexity, model architecture, and optimizer choice
influence the rate and severity at which samples become vulnerable. Crucially,
we discover a robust correlation between a sample's intrinsic learning
difficulty, and find that the privacy risk of samples highly vulnerable in the
final trained model is largely determined early during training. Our results
thus provide a deeper understanding of how privacy risks dynamically emerge
during training, laying the groundwork for proactive, privacy-aware model
training strategies.

Motivation: 简化序列模型的创建，支持多种执行模式（如逐层训练和逐步采样），同时确保一致性和减少常见错误。

Method: 定义显式状态表示（如Transformer KV缓存、卷积缓冲区、RNN隐藏状态）和逐步更新方法，确保与逐层调用结果一致。

Conclusion: SequenceLayers通过可组合的声明式API和丰富的层与组合器，简化了生产级模型的构建，同时保持了强正确性保证。

Abstract: We introduce a neural network layer API and library for sequence modeling,
designed for easy creation of sequence models that can be executed both
layer-by-layer (e.g., teacher-forced training) and step-by-step (e.g.,
autoregressive sampling). To achieve this, layers define an explicit
representation of their state over time (e.g., a Transformer KV cache, a
convolution buffer, an RNN hidden state), and a step method that evolves that
state, tested to give identical results to a stateless layer-wise invocation.
This and other aspects of the SequenceLayers contract enables complex models to
be immediately streamable, mitigates a wide range of common bugs arising in
both streaming and parallel sequence processing, and can be implemented in any
deep learning library. A composable and declarative API, along with a
comprehensive suite of layers and combinators, streamlines the construction of
production-scale models from simple streamable components while preserving
strong correctness guarantees. Our current implementations of SequenceLayers
(JAX, TensorFlow 2) are available at https://github.com/google/sequence-layers.

Result: 在真实零售数据集上，新算法比现有NBP基线方法表现优10-15%。

Conclusion: 新算法填补了NBP领域中被遗忘商品预测的空白，并提供了可解释的推荐。

Abstract: Accurately identifying items forgotten during a supermarket visit and
providing clear, interpretable explanations for recommending them remains an
underexplored problem within the Next Basket Prediction (NBP) domain. Existing
NBP approaches typically only focus on forecasting future purchases, without
explicitly addressing the detection of unintentionally omitted items. This gap
is partly due to the scarcity of real-world datasets that allow for the
reliable estimation of forgotten items. Furthermore, most current NBP methods
rely on black-box models, which lack transparency and limit the ability to
justify recommendations to end users. In this paper, we formally introduce the
forgotten item prediction task and propose two novel interpretable-by-design
algorithms. These methods are tailored to identify forgotten items while
offering intuitive, human-understandable explanations. Experiments on a
real-world retail dataset show our algorithms outperform state-of-the-art NBP
baselines by 10-15% across multiple evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于过程奖励模型（PRMs）的方法，通过内在信号驱动的生成过程评估机制，加速大型推理模型（LRMs）的强化学习训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖稀疏的结果奖励，导致优化效率低下。本文旨在通过过程奖励模型提供更密集的反馈，提升训练效率。

Method: 提出了一种基于内在信号的生成过程评估机制，将连续的正确/错误步骤聚合为连贯的‘思考’单元，并引入能力自适应奖励机制动态平衡探索与利用。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在1.5B和7B参数的LRMs上显著提高了问题解决准确率，且训练样本需求大幅减少。

Conclusion: 结构化的过程奖励能显著加速LRMs在数学推理任务中的优化。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently shown promise in solving complex
math problems when optimized with Reinforcement Learning (RL). But conventional
approaches rely on outcome-only rewards that provide sparse feedback, resulting
in inefficient optimization process. In this work, we investigate the function
of process reward models (PRMs) to accelerate the RL training for LRMs. We
propose a novel intrinsic signal-driven generative process evaluation mechanism
operating at the thought level to address major bottlenecks in RL-based
training. Specifically, instead of requiring PRMs to know how to solve
problems, our method uses intrinsic signals in solutions to judge stepwise
correctness and aggregate contiguous correct/incorrect steps into coherent
'thought' units. This structured, thought-level rewards enable more reliable
credit assignment by reducing ambiguity in step segmentation and alleviating
reward hacking. We further introduce a capability-adaptive reward mechanism
that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation based on the LRM's
current proficiency, guiding learning without stifling creative
trial-and-error. These innovations are integrated into a new off-policy RL
algorithm, TP-GRPO, which extends grouped proximal optimization with
process-based rewards and improves training efficiency. Experiments on 1.5B and
7B parameter LRMs demonstrate that our method achieves higher problem-solving
accuracy with significantly fewer training samples than outcome-only reward
baselines. The results validate that well-structured process rewards can
substantially accelerate LRM optimization in math reasoning tasks. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有认证恢复技术在top-k预测中无法精确认证真实标签，且存在组合爆炸问题，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: CostCert通过设计验证攻击预算是否不足以覆盖最小额外投票数，从而避免组合爆炸和成对比较。

Result: 实验表明，CostCert在补丁大小为96时仍保持57.3%的认证准确率，显著优于PatchGuard。

Conclusion: CostCert提供了一种高效且精确的认证恢复方法，适用于对抗性补丁攻击防御。

Abstract: Patch robustness certification is an emerging verification approach for
defending against adversarial patch attacks with provable guarantees for deep
learning systems. Certified recovery techniques guarantee the prediction of the
sole true label of a certified sample. However, existing techniques, if
applicable to top-k predictions, commonly conduct pairwise comparisons on those
votes between labels, failing to certify the sole true label within the top k
prediction labels precisely due to the inflation on the number of votes
controlled by the attacker (i.e., attack budget); yet enumerating all
combinations of vote allocation suffers from the combinatorial explosion
problem. We propose CostCert, a novel, scalable, and precise voting-based
certified recovery defender. CostCert verifies the true label of a sample
within the top k predictions without pairwise comparisons and combinatorial
explosion through a novel design: whether the attack budget on the sample is
infeasible to cover the smallest total additional votes on top of the votes
uncontrollable by the attacker to exclude the true labels from the top k
prediction labels. Experiments show that CostCert significantly outperforms the
current state-of-the-art defender PatchGuard, such as retaining up to 57.3% in
certified accuracy when the patch size is 96, whereas PatchGuard has already
dropped to zero.

Motivation: 共享单车系统中，时空变化的用户需求导致库存不平衡，增加了调度成本。动态定价是解决这一问题的关键，但传统方法难以处理用户多样性和概率性选择。

Method: 开发了一种可微分代理模拟方法，用于快速设计动态定价策略，以应对时空异质性出行和用户概率性决策。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比传统方法损失减少73%至78%，收敛速度提升100倍以上，并能在大规模系统中实现无需人工调度的库存平衡。

Conclusion: 通过适当的初始条件设置，可以最小化诱导库存平衡的折扣成本，证明了该方法的实用性和高效性。

Abstract: Bike-sharing systems are emerging in various cities as a new ecofriendly
transportation system. In these systems, spatiotemporally varying user demands
lead to imbalanced inventory at bicycle stations, resulting in additional
relocation costs. Therefore, it is essential to manage user demand through
optimal dynamic pricing for the system. However, optimal pricing design for
such a system is challenging because the system involves users with diverse
backgrounds and their probabilistic choices. To address this problem, we
develop a differentiable agent-based simulation to rapidly design dynamic
pricing in bike-sharing systems, achieving balanced bicycle inventory despite
spatiotemporally heterogeneous trips and probabilistic user decisions. We first
validate our approach against conventional methods through numerical
experiments involving 25 bicycle stations and five time slots, yielding 100
parameters. Compared to the conventional methods, our approach obtains a more
accurate solution with a 73% to 78% reduction in loss while achieving more than
a 100-fold increase in convergence speed. We further validate our approach on a
large-scale urban bike-sharing system scenario involving 289 bicycle stations,
resulting in a total of 1156 parameters. Through simulations using the obtained
pricing policies, we confirm that these policies can naturally induce balanced
inventory without any manual relocation. Additionally, we find that the cost of
discounts to induce the balanced inventory can be minimized by setting
appropriate initial conditions.

Conclusion: 因果解释框架提高了概念漂移解释的实用性，为系统干预提供了更直接的依据。

Abstract: In a world that constantly changes, it is crucial to understand how those
changes impact different systems, such as industrial manufacturing or critical
infrastructure. Explaining critical changes, referred to as concept drift in
the field of machine learning, is the first step towards enabling targeted
interventions to avoid or correct model failures, as well as malfunctions and
errors in the physical world. Therefore, in this work, we extend model-based
drift explanations towards causal explanations, which increases the
actionability of the provided explanations. We evaluate our explanation
strategy on a number of use cases, demonstrating the practical usefulness of
our framework, which isolates the causally relevant features impacted by
concept drift and, thus, allows for targeted intervention.

Result: 在MetaWorld机器人任务中，PLARE性能达到或超过现有VLM奖励生成方法，并在真实机器人任务中验证了实用性。

Conclusion: PLARE提供了一种无需显式奖励模型的离线强化学习新方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) provides a powerful framework for
training robotic agents using pre-collected, suboptimal datasets, eliminating
the need for costly, time-consuming, and potentially hazardous online
interactions. This is particularly useful in safety-critical real-world
applications, where online data collection is expensive and impractical.
However, existing offline RL algorithms typically require reward labeled data,
which introduces an additional bottleneck: reward function design is itself
costly, labor-intensive, and requires significant domain expertise. In this
paper, we introduce PLARE, a novel approach that leverages large
vision-language models (VLMs) to provide guidance signals for agent training.
Instead of relying on manually designed reward functions, PLARE queries a VLM
for preference labels on pairs of visual trajectory segments based on a
language task description. The policy is then trained directly from these
preference labels using a supervised contrastive preference learning objective,
bypassing the need to learn explicit reward models. Through extensive
experiments on robotic manipulation tasks from the MetaWorld, PLARE achieves
performance on par with or surpassing existing state-of-the-art VLM-based
reward generation methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
PLARE in real-world manipulation tasks with a physical robot, further
validating its practical applicability.

Abstract: We propose the Spatiotemporal State Space Neural Operator (ST-SSM), a compact
architecture for learning solution operators of time-dependent partial
differential equations (PDEs). ST-SSM introduces a novel factorization of the
spatial and temporal dimensions, using structured state-space models to
independently model temporal evolution and spatial interactions. This design
enables parameter efficiency and flexible modeling of long-range spatiotemporal
dynamics. A theoretical connection is established between SSMs and neural
operators, and a unified universality theorem is proved for the resulting class
of architectures. Empirically, we demonstrate that our factorized formulation
outperforms alternative schemes such as zigzag scanning and parallel
independent processing on several PDE benchmarks, including 1D Burgers'
equation, 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and 2D Navier-Stokes equations
under varying physical conditions. Our model performs competitively with
existing baselines while using significantly fewer parameters. In addition, our
results reinforce previous findings on the benefits of temporal memory by
showing improved performance under partial observability. Our results highlight
the advantages of dimensionally factorized operator learning for efficient and
generalizable PDE modeling, and put this approach on a firm theoretical
footing.

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) is an efficient approach
to automatically co-optimizing neural network performance and hardware energy
efficiency, making it particularly useful for the development of Deep Neural
Network accelerators on the edge. However, the extensive search space and high
computational cost pose significant challenges to its practical adoption. To
address these limitations, we propose Coflex, a novel HW-NAS framework that
integrates the Sparse Gaussian Process (SGP) with multi-objective Bayesian
optimization. By leveraging sparse inducing points, Coflex reduces the GP
kernel complexity from cubic to near-linear with respect to the number of
training samples, without compromising optimization performance. This enables
scalable approximation of large-scale search space, substantially decreasing
computational overhead while preserving high predictive accuracy. We evaluate
the efficacy of Coflex across various benchmarks, focusing on
accelerator-specific architecture. Our experi- mental results show that Coflex
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of network accuracy and
Energy-Delay-Product, while achieving a computational speed-up ranging from

Specifically, we formulate a manifold-regularised variant of the $\ell_p$-SVDD

Abstract: Objective. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a highly prevalent
non-communicable chronic disease that substantially reduces life expectancy.
Accurate estimation of all-cause mortality risk in T2DM patients is crucial for
personalizing and optimizing treatment strategies. Research Design and Methods.
This study analyzed a cohort of 554 patients (aged 40-87 years) with diagnosed
T2DM over a maximum follow-up period of 16.8 years, during which 202 patients

the best predictive performance. The model achieved a C-statistic of 0.776,
with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of
0.86, 0.80, 0.841, and 0.826 for 5-, 10-, 15-, and 16.8-year all-cause
mortality predictions, respectively. The SHAP approach was employed to
interpret the model's individual decision-making processes. Conclusions. The
developed model exhibited strong predictive performance for mortality risk
assessment. Its clinically interpretable outputs enable potential bedside
application, improving the identification of high-risk patients and supporting
timely treatment optimization.

*Maurits Kaptein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文分析了因果效应决策中结构不确定性的重要性，提出贝叶斯模型平均方法，并确定了其适用条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实践中决策者常忽略结构不确定性，研究旨在探讨何时需解决此问题。

Method: 采用贝叶斯模型平均方法，分析双变量关系（X→Y vs. X←Y），并通过模拟验证现代因果发现方法的量化能力。

Result: 模型平均在结构不确定性高、因果效应差异大且损失函数敏感时有效，证明了方法的理论最优性。

Conclusion: 该框架补充了现有稳健因果推断方法，解决了实践中常被忽视的不确定性来源。

Abstract: Practitioners making decisions based on causal effects typically ignore
structural uncertainty. We analyze when this uncertainty is consequential
enough to warrant methodological solutions (Bayesian model averaging over
competing causal structures). Focusing on bivariate relationships ($X
\rightarrow Y$ vs. $X \leftarrow Y$), we establish that model averaging is
beneficial when: (1) structural uncertainty is moderate to high, (2) causal
effects differ substantially between structures, and (3) loss functions are
sufficiently sensitive to the size of the causal effect. We prove optimality
results of our suggested methodological solution under regularity conditions
and demonstrate through simulations that modern causal discovery methods can
provide, within limits, the necessary quantification. Our framework complements
existing robust causal inference approaches by addressing a distinct source of
uncertainty typically overlooked in practice.

*Nicklas Werge,Yi-Shan Wu,Bahareh Tasdighi,Melih Kandemir*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DEA的自适应集成聚合方法，用于解决连续控制任务中Q值估计的保守性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态集成聚合方法（如取最小值）虽然能缓解高估偏差，但过于粗糙，无法适应任务需求或学习阶段的变化。

Method: DEA通过两个可学习的参数（一个调节保守性，一个指导探索）和基于Bellman误差方向的加权机制，实现自适应聚合。

Result: 在连续控制任务和不同学习机制下，DEA表现优于静态集成策略。

Conclusion: DEA通过数据驱动的方式动态调整保守性和探索性，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning in continuous control tasks depends
critically on accurate $Q$-value estimates. Conservative aggregation over
ensembles, such as taking the minimum, is commonly used to mitigate
overestimation bias. However, these static rules are coarse, discard valuable
information from the ensemble, and cannot adapt to task-specific needs or
different learning regimes. We propose Directional Ensemble Aggregation (DEA),
an aggregation method that adaptively combines $Q$-value estimates in
actor-critic frameworks. DEA introduces two fully learnable directional
parameters: one that modulates critic-side conservatism and another that guides
actor-side policy exploration. Both parameters are learned using ensemble
disagreement-weighted Bellman errors, which weight each sample solely by the
direction of its Bellman error. This directional learning mechanism allows DEA
to adjust conservatism and exploration in a data-driven way, adapting
aggregation to both uncertainty levels and the phase of training. We evaluate
DEA across continuous control benchmarks and learning regimes - from
interactive to sample-efficient - and demonstrate its effectiveness over static
ensemble strategies.

### [206] [A Verifier Hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23504)
*Maurits Kaptein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了证书长度与验证器运行时间之间的权衡关系，提出了一个验证器权衡定理，并探讨了其在复杂性理论中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究如何通过调整证书长度来优化验证器的运行时间，以及这种权衡对复杂性类分离和自然问题分析的影响。

Method: 提出并证明了一个验证器权衡定理，表明减少验证时间需要增加证书长度，并基于此构建了一个自然层次结构。

Result: 验证器权衡定理成立，且该定理可用于分析复杂性类分离（如NP与EXPTIME）及自然问题（如字符串周期性和旋转检测）。

Conclusion: 论文为理解P与NP问题提供了新视角，特别是通过子线性证书的存在性来探讨这一问题。

Abstract: We investigate the trade-off between certificate length and verifier runtime.
We prove a Verifier Trade-off Theorem showing that reducing the inherent
verification time of a language from \(f(n)\) to \(g(n)\), where \(f(n) \ge
g(n)\), requires certificates of length at least \(\Omega(\log(f(n) / g(n)))\).
This theorem induces a natural hierarchy based on certificate complexity. We
demonstrate its applicability to analyzing conjectured separations between
complexity classes (e.g., \(\np\) and \(\exptime\)) and to studying natural
problems such as string periodicity and rotation detection. Additionally, we
provide perspectives on the \(\p\) vs. \(\np\) problem by relating it to the
existence of sub-linear certificates.

*Saleh Vatan Khah,Savelii Chezhegov,Shahrokh Farahmand,Samuel Horváth,Eduard Gorbunov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了针对DP-Clipped-SGD的固定阈值梯度裁剪方法的高概率收敛分析，填补了现有研究空白，适用于重尾噪声下的凸和非凸优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高概率收敛分析要求裁剪阈值随优化步骤增加，这与标准DP机制（如高斯机制）不兼容，因此需要研究固定阈值下的收敛性。

Method: 采用固定裁剪阈值的DP-Clipped-SGD方法，适用于重尾噪声（通过有界中心α阶矩假设描述）下的凸和非凸平滑优化问题。

Result: 固定裁剪阈值下，方法以更快速度收敛到最优解的邻域，且邻域大小可与DP引入的噪声平衡。

Conclusion: 研究为梯度裁剪在DP机制中的应用提供了更优的收敛速度和隐私保证权衡。

Abstract: Gradient clipping is a fundamental tool in Deep Learning, improving the
high-probability convergence of stochastic first-order methods like SGD,
AdaGrad, and Adam under heavy-tailed noise, which is common in training large
language models. It is also a crucial component of Differential Privacy (DP)
mechanisms. However, existing high-probability convergence analyses typically
require the clipping threshold to increase with the number of optimization
steps, which is incompatible with standard DP mechanisms like the Gaussian
mechanism. In this work, we close this gap by providing the first
high-probability convergence analysis for DP-Clipped-SGD with a fixed clipping
level, applicable to both convex and non-convex smooth optimization under
heavy-tailed noise, characterized by a bounded central $\alpha$-th moment
assumption, $\alpha \in (1,2]$. Our results show that, with a fixed clipping
level, the method converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution with a
faster rate than the existing ones. The neighborhood can be balanced against
the noise introduced by DP, providing a refined trade-off between convergence
speed and privacy guarantees.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Experience Blending的新框架，通过结合存储的关键样本和合成的边界数据（SBD）来改进持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习（CL）中的灾难性遗忘问题限制了模型的性能，现有方法如经验回放因样本分布稀疏而效果有限。

Method: 提出Experience Blending框架，包含两个核心组件：1）多变量差分隐私噪声机制生成SBD；2）端到端训练策略结合关键样本和SBD。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny ImageNet上优于9种基线方法，准确率分别提升10%、6%和13%。

Conclusion: SBD作为隐式正则化器有效改善了决策边界稳定性，显著减轻了灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to address catastrophic forgetting in models
trained sequentially on multiple tasks. While experience replay has shown
promise, its effectiveness is often limited by the sparse distribution of
stored key samples, leading to overly simplified decision boundaries. We
hypothesize that introducing synthetic data near the decision boundary
(Synthetic Boundary Data, or SBD) during training serves as an implicit
regularizer, improving boundary stability and mitigating forgetting. To
validate this hypothesis, we propose a novel training framework, {\bf
Experience Blending}, which integrates knowledge from both stored key samples
and synthetic, boundary-adjacent data. Experience blending consists of two core
components: (1) a multivariate Differential Privacy (DP) noise mechanism that
injects batch-wise noise into low-dimensional feature representations,
generating SBD; and (2) an end-to-end training strategy that jointly leverages
both stored key samples and SBD. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate that our method outperforms nine CL baselines,
achieving accuracy improvements of 10%, 6%, and 13%, respectively.

Motivation: 探索PEFT方法在资源受限的边缘设备上的应用，尤其是在卷积架构中的表现，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 在标准卷积和深度可分离卷积架构上评估LoRA、DoRA和GaLore等PEFT方法，并与传统微调方法对比性能和计算成本。

Result: PEFT方法在深度可分离卷积架构中的内存效率仅为LLM的一半，但在边缘优化的卷积架构中，适配器方法可减少95%的浮点运算。

Conclusion: 研究结果为基于硬件限制、性能需求和应用的PEFT方法选择提供了指导。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods reduce the computational costs
of updating deep learning models by minimizing the number of additional
parameters used to adapt a model to a down- stream task. While extensively
researched in large language models (LLMs), their application to smaller models
used on edge devices, such as convolutional neural networks, remains
underexplored. This paper benchmarks and analyzes popular PEFT methods on
convolutional architectures typically deployed in resource-constrained edge
environments. We evaluate LoRA, DoRA, and GaLore for updating standard and
depthwise convolutional architectures to handle distribution shifts and
accommodate unseen classes. We utilize recently proposed PyTorch profilers to
compare the updated model performance and computational costs of these PEFT
methods with traditional fine-tuning approaches. With resource efficiency in
mind, we investigate their update behavior across different rank dimensions. We
find that the evaluated PEFT methods are only half as memory-efficient when
applied to depthwise-separable convolution architectures, compared to their
efficiency with LLMs. Conversely, when targeting convolu- tional architectures
optimized for edge deployment, adapter-based PEFT methods can reduce floating
point operations (FLOPs) during model updates by up to 95%. These insights
offer valuable guidance for selecting PEFT methods based on hardware
constraints, performance requirements, and application needs. Our code is
online.

Abstract: Motivated by the problem of fast processing of attention matrices, we study
fast algorithms for computing matrix-vector products for asymmetric Gaussian
Kernel matrices $K\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$. $K$'s columns are indexed by a
set of $n$ keys $k_1,k_2\ldots, k_n\in \mathbb{R}^d$, rows by a set of $n$
queries $q_1,q_2,\ldots,q_n\in \mathbb{R}^d $, and its $i,j$ entry is $K_{ij} =
e^{-\|q_i-k_j\|_2^2/2\sigma^2}$ for some bandwidth parameter $\sigma>0$. Given
a vector $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$ and error parameter $\epsilon>0$, our task is to
output a $y\in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\|Kx-y\|_2\leq \epsilon \|x\|_2$ in
time subquadratic in $n$ and linear in $d$. Our algorithms rely on the
following modelling assumption about the matrices $K$: the sum of the entries
of $K$ scales linearly in $n$, as opposed to worst case quadratic growth. We
validate this assumption experimentally, for Gaussian kernel matrices
encountered in various settings such as fast attention computation in LLMs. We
obtain the first subquadratic-time algorithm that works under this assumption,
for unrestricted vectors.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise orders-of-magnitude lower power
consumption and low-latency inference on neuromorphic hardware for a wide range
of robotic tasks. In this work, we present an energy-efficient implementation
of a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm using quantized SNNs to solve two
classical control tasks. The network is trained using the Q-learning algorithm,
then fine-tuned and quantized to low-bit (8-bit) precision for embedded
deployment on the SpiNNaker2 neuromorphic chip. To evaluate the comparative
advantage of SpiNNaker2 over conventional computing platforms, we analyze
inference latency, dynamic power consumption, and energy cost per inference for
our SNN models, comparing performance against a GTX 1650 GPU baseline. Our
results demonstrate SpiNNaker2's strong potential for scalable, low-energy
neuromorphic computing, achieving up to 32x reduction in energy consumption.
Inference latency remains on par with GPU-based execution, with improvements
observed in certain task settings, reinforcing SpiNNaker2's viability for
real-time neuromorphic control and making the neuromorphic approach a
compelling direction for efficient deep Q-learning.

Motivation: 解决高维数据中特征选择的组合优化问题，捕捉特征间依赖关系，提升模型稀疏性和可解释性。

Method: 使用模拟退火进行全局搜索，以Fisher判别比作为模型质量的代理指标。

Result: 在实验中，SA-FDR能选择更紧凑的特征子集，同时保持高预测精度。

Conclusion: SA-FDR为高维数据提供了一种灵活且有效的特征选择方法，特别适用于稀疏性、可解释性和性能要求高的场景。

Abstract: We introduce SA-FDR, a novel algorithm for $\ell_0$-norm feature selection
that considers this task as a combinatorial optimisation problem and solves it
by using simulated annealing to perform a global search over the space of
feature subsets. The optimisation is guided by the Fisher discriminant ratio,
which we use as a computationally efficient proxy for model quality in
classification tasks. Our experiments, conducted on datasets with up to
hundreds of thousands of samples and hundreds of features, demonstrate that
SA-FDR consistently selects more compact feature subsets while achieving a high
predictive accuracy. This ability to recover informative yet minimal sets of
features stems from its capacity to capture inter-feature dependencies often
missed by greedy optimisation approaches. As a result, SA-FDR provides a
flexible and effective solution for designing interpretable models in
high-dimensional settings, particularly when model sparsity, interpretability,
and performance are crucial.

Conclusion: GraphRAG-R1显著提升了LLMs的多跳推理能力，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has shown great effectiveness
in enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs by leveraging graph structures for
knowledge representation and modeling complex real-world relationships.
However, existing GraphRAG methods still face significant bottlenecks when
handling complex problems that require multi-hop reasoning, as their query and
retrieval phases are largely based on pre-defined heuristics and do not fully
utilize the reasoning potentials of LLMs. To address this problem, we propose
GraphRAG-R1, an adaptive GraphRAG framework by training LLMs with
process-constrained outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the
multi-hop reasoning ability. Our method can decompose complex problems,
autonomously invoke retrieval tools to acquire necessary information, and
perform effective reasoning. Specifically, we utilize a modified version of
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that supports rollout-with-thinking
capability. Next, we design two process-constrained reward functions. To handle
the shallow retrieval problem, we design a Progressive Retrieval Attenuation
(PRA) reward to encourage essential retrievals. Then, to handle the
over-thinking problem, we design Cost-Aware F1 (CAF) reward to balance the
model performance with computational costs. We further design a phase-dependent
training strategy, containing three training stages corresponding to cold start
and these two rewards. Lastly, our method adopts a hybrid graph-textual
retrieval to improve the reasoning capacity. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that GraphRAG-R1 boosts LLM capabilities in solving complex
reasoning problems compared to state-of-the-art GraphRAG methods on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Furthermore, our framework can be
flexibly integrated with various existing retrieval methods, consistently
delivering performance improvements.

Conclusion: EB-gMCR结合了高容量生成建模和硬组件选择，为大规模信号解混分析提供了实用解决方案，并可轻松适应其他领域。

Abstract: Signal unmixing analysis decomposes data into basic patterns and is widely
applied in chemical and biological research. Multivariate curve resolution
(MCR), a branch of signal unmixing, separates mixed chemical signals into base
patterns (components) and their concentrations, playing a key role in
understanding composition. Classical MCR is typically framed as matrix
factorization (MF) and requires a user-specified component count, usually
unknown in real data. As dataset size or component count increases, the
scalability and reliability of MF-based MCR face significant challenges. This
study reformulates MCR as a generative process (gMCR), and introduces an
energy-based deep learning solver, EB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the
smallest component set able to reconstruct the data faithfully. EB-gMCR starts
from a large candidate pool (e.g., 1024 spectra) and employs a differentiable
gating network to retain only active components while estimating their
concentrations. On noisy synthetic datasets containing up to 256 latent
sources, EB-gMCR maintained R^2 >= 0.98 and recovered the component count
within 5% of the ground truth; at lower noise it achieved R^2 >= 0.99 with near
exact component estimation. Additional chemical priors, such as non-negativity
or nonlinear mixing, enter as simple plug-in functions, enabling adaptation to
other instruments or domains without altering the core learning process. By
uniting high-capacity generative modeling and hard component selection, EB-gMCR
offers a practical route to large-scale signal unmixing analysis, including
chemical library-driven scenarios. The source code is available at

Abstract: Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods allow for
learning scalable multi-agent policies, but suffer from partial observability
and induced non-stationarity. These challenges can be addressed by introducing
mechanisms that facilitate coordination and high-level planning. Specifically,
coordination and temporal abstraction can be achieved through communication
(e.g., message passing) and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL)
approaches to decision-making. However, optimization issues limit the
applicability of hierarchical policies to multi-agent systems. As such, the
combination of these approaches has not been fully explored. To fill this void,
we propose a novel and effective methodology for learning multi-agent
hierarchies of message-passing policies. We adopt the feudal HRL framework and
rely on a hierarchical graph structure for planning and coordination among
agents. Agents at lower levels in the hierarchy receive goals from the upper
levels and exchange messages with neighboring agents at the same level. To
learn hierarchical multi-agent policies, we design a novel reward-assignment
method based on training the lower-level policies to maximize the advantage
function associated with the upper levels. Results on relevant benchmarks show
that our method performs favorably compared to the state of the art.

Abstract: Clinical trials are a systematic endeavor to assess the safety and efficacy
of new drugs or treatments. Conducting such trials typically demands
significant financial investment and meticulous planning, highlighting the need
for accurate predictions of trial outcomes. Accurately predicting patient
enrollment, a key factor in trial success, is one of the primary challenges
during the planning phase. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based
method to address this critical challenge. Our method, implemented as a neural
network model, leverages pre-trained language models (PLMs) to capture the
complexities and nuances of clinical documents, transforming them into
expressive representations. These representations are then combined with
encoded tabular features via an attention mechanism. To account for
uncertainties in enrollment prediction, we enhance the model with a
probabilistic layer based on the Gamma distribution, which enables range
estimation. We apply the proposed model to predict clinical trial duration,
assuming site-level enrollment follows a Poisson-Gamma process. We carry out
extensive experiments on real-world clinical trial data, and show that the
proposed method can effectively predict the number of patients enrolled at a
number of sites for a given clinical trial, outperforming established baseline
models.

Abstract: Data augmentation is gaining importance across various aspects of time series
analysis, from forecasting to classification and anomaly detection tasks. We
introduce the Latent Generative Transformer Augmentation (L-GTA) model, a
generative approach using a transformer-based variational recurrent
autoencoder. This model uses controlled transformations within the latent space
of the model to generate new time series that preserve the intrinsic properties
of the original dataset. L-GTA enables the application of diverse
transformations, ranging from simple jittering to magnitude warping, and
combining these basic transformations to generate more complex synthetic time
series datasets. Our evaluation of several real-world datasets demonstrates the
ability of L-GTA to produce more reliable, consistent, and controllable
augmented data. This translates into significant improvements in predictive
accuracy and similarity measures compared to direct transformation methods.

Result: 揭示了softmax注意力表达力更强的机制，为改进线性注意力提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: softmax注意力的RNN框架解释为其优越性提供了新视角，有助于未来高效注意力机制的设计。

Abstract: Since its introduction, softmax attention has become the backbone of modern
transformer architectures due to its expressiveness and scalability across a
wide range of tasks. However, the main drawback of softmax attention is the
quadratic memory requirement and computational complexity with respect to the
sequence length. By replacing the softmax nonlinearity, linear attention and
similar methods have been introduced to avoid the quadratic bottleneck of
softmax attention. Despite these linear forms of attention being derived from
the original softmax formulation, they typically lag in terms of downstream
accuracy. While strong intuition of the softmax nonlinearity on the query and
key inner product suggests that it has desirable properties compared to other
nonlinearities, the question of why this discrepancy exists still remains
unanswered. This work demonstrates that linear attention is an approximation of
softmax attention by deriving the recurrent form of softmax attention. Using
this form, each part of softmax attention can be described in the language of
recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Describing softmax attention as an RNN allows
for the ablation of the components of softmax attention to understand the
importance of each part and how they interact. In this way, our work helps
explain why softmax attention is more expressive than its counterparts.

TL;DR: OptiGradTrust是一个联邦学习防御框架，通过六维指纹评估梯度更新，结合FedBN-Prox解决数据异构性问题，显著提升防御性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在医疗领域需要保护隐私，但易受拜占庭攻击和数据异构性影响，因此需要更强大的防御框架。

Method: 提出OptiGradTrust框架，利用六维指纹和混合RL-注意力模块进行信任评分，并结合FedBN-Prox优化收敛。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和阿尔茨海默MRI数据集上表现优异，优于现有防御方法。

Conclusion: OptiGradTrust在防御攻击和处理数据异构性方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed medical institutions while preserving patient privacy, but remains
vulnerable to Byzantine attacks and statistical heterogeneity. We present
OptiGradTrust, a comprehensive defense framework that evaluates gradient
updates through a novel six-dimensional fingerprint including VAE
reconstruction error, cosine similarity metrics, $L_2$ norm, sign-consistency
ratio, and Monte Carlo Shapley value, which drive a hybrid RL-attention module
for adaptive trust scoring. To address convergence challenges under data
heterogeneity, we develop FedBN-Prox (FedBN-P), combining Federated Batch
Normalization with proximal regularization for optimal accuracy-convergence
trade-offs. Extensive evaluation across MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Alzheimer's MRI
datasets under various Byzantine attack scenarios demonstrates significant
improvements over state-of-the-art defenses, achieving up to +1.6 percentage
points over FLGuard under non-IID conditions while maintaining robust
performance against diverse attack patterns through our adaptive learning
approach.

Motivation: 探索SHAP在模型优化中的作用，提升预测性能和可解释性。

Method: 采用基于熵的惩罚机制，鼓励稀疏且稳定的特征分布，适用于回归和分类任务。

Result: 实验表明，该方法提高了泛化性能，同时保证了特征解释的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为机器学习模型提供了一种新颖的可解释性驱动正则化方法，提升了准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Feature attribution methods such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) have
become instrumental in understanding machine learning models, but their role in
guiding model optimization remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a
SHAP-guided regularization framework that incorporates feature importance
constraints into model training to enhance both predictive performance and
interpretability. Our approach applies entropy-based penalties to encourage
sparse, concentrated feature attributions while promoting stability across
samples. The framework is applicable to both regression and classification
tasks. Our first exploration started with investigating a tree-based model
regularization using TreeSHAP. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
regression and classification datasets, we demonstrate that our method improves
generalization performance while ensuring robust and interpretable feature
attributions. The proposed technique offers a novel, explainability-driven
regularization approach, making machine learning models both more accurate and
more reliable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于聊天机器人交互的个性化特点和语义相似性搜索的局限性，传统缓存方法难以保持响应的相关性。

Method: 采用轻量级LLM动态调整缓存响应，结合用户研究和多代理LLM辩论进行评估。

Result: TweakLLM在保持响应质量的同时显著提高了缓存效率，适用于高流量LLM部署。

Conclusion: TweakLLM是一种可扩展且资源高效的缓存解决方案，不损害用户体验。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) process millions of queries daily, making
efficient response caching a compelling optimization for reducing cost and
latency. However, preserving relevance to user queries using this approach
proves difficult due to the personalized nature of chatbot interactions and the
limited accuracy of semantic similarity search. To address this, we present
TweakLLM, a novel routing architecture that employs a lightweight LLM to
dynamically adapt cached responses to incoming prompts. Through comprehensive
evaluation, including user studies with side-by-side comparisons, satisfaction
voting, as well as multi-agent LLM debates, we demonstrate that TweakLLM
maintains response quality comparable to frontier models while significantly
improving cache effectiveness. Our results across real-world datasets highlight
TweakLLM as a scalable, resource-efficient caching solution for high-volume LLM
deployments without compromising user experience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散策略在在线强化学习中表现优异，但其迭代采样过程缓慢，限制了响应速度。

Method: 利用流匹配模型中分布方差与单步采样离散误差的理论联系，提出FPMD算法，无需额外蒸馏或一致性训练。

Result: 在MuJoCo基准测试中，FPMD性能与扩散策略相当，推理时函数评估次数减少数百倍。

Conclusion: FPMD通过一步采样显著提升推理效率，同时保持高性能，为在线强化学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion policies have achieved great success in online reinforcement
learning (RL) due to their strong expressive capacity. However, the inference
of diffusion policy models relies on a slow iterative sampling process, which
limits their responsiveness. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow
Policy Mirror Descent (FPMD), an online RL algorithm that enables 1-step
sampling during policy inference. Our approach exploits a theoretical
connection between the distribution variance and the discretization error of
single-step sampling in straight interpolation flow matching models, and
requires no extra distillation or consistency training. We present two
algorithm variants based on flow policy and MeanFlow policy parametrizations,
respectively. Extensive empirical evaluations on MuJoCo benchmarks demonstrate
that our algorithms show strong performance comparable to diffusion policy
baselines while requiring hundreds of times fewer function evaluations during
inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微生物组数据稀疏且噪声大，现有填补方法难以捕捉微生物间的复杂依赖关系和上下文元数据。

Method: 结合扩散生成模型和依赖感知Transformer，利用VAE预训练和LLM编码患者元数据。

Result: 在TCGA数据集上，DepMicroDiff的Pearson相关系数达0.712，余弦相似度达0.812，RMSE和MAE更低。

Conclusion: DepMicroDiff在微生物组填补任务中表现出色，具有鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Microbiome data analysis is essential for understanding host health and
disease, yet its inherent sparsity and noise pose major challenges for accurate
imputation, hindering downstream tasks such as biomarker discovery. Existing
imputation methods, including recent diffusion-based models, often fail to
capture the complex interdependencies between microbial taxa and overlook
contextual metadata that can inform imputation. We introduce DepMicroDiff, a
novel framework that combines diffusion-based generative modeling with a
Dependency-Aware Transformer (DAT) to explicitly capture both mutual pairwise
dependencies and autoregressive relationships. DepMicroDiff is further enhanced
by VAE-based pretraining across diverse cancer datasets and conditioning on
patient metadata encoded via a large language model (LLM). Experiments on TCGA
microbiome datasets show that DepMicroDiff substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher Pearson correlation (up to 0.712),
cosine similarity (up to 0.812), and lower RMSE and MAE across multiple cancer
types, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability for microbiome
imputation.

Result: 在工业异常检测数据集上验证了方法的有效性，比较了异常样本与正常样本的效用。

Conclusion: 异常样本在少样本设置下具有显著价值，提出的方法能有效提升异常分类性能。

Abstract: Several anomaly detection and classification methods rely on large amounts of
non-anomalous or "normal" samples under the assump- tion that anomalous data is
typically harder to acquire. This hypothesis becomes questionable in Few-Shot
settings, where as little as one anno- tated sample can make a significant
difference. In this paper, we tackle the question of utilizing anomalous
samples in training a model for bi- nary anomaly classification. We propose a
methodology that incorporates anomalous samples in a multi-score anomaly
detection score leveraging recent Zero-Shot and memory-based techniques. We
compare the utility of anomalous samples to that of regular samples and study
the benefits and limitations of each. In addition, we propose an
augmentation-based validation technique to optimize the aggregation of the
different anomaly scores and demonstrate its effectiveness on popular
industrial anomaly detection datasets.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种基于知识推荐系统（RS）的查询-标注者配对策略，通过考虑标注者的情绪和疲劳水平，减少标注错误并提高模型准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主动学习（AL）中标注数据的成本和错误率是关键挑战，现有方法未充分考虑标注者的内部因素（如情绪和疲劳）对标注质量的影响。

Method: 使用知识推荐系统（RS）结合标注者的历史准确率、情绪和疲劳水平，以及查询实例信息，选择最佳标注者。

Result: 实验表明，考虑情绪和疲劳水平显著减少了标注错误和模型不确定性，同时提高了准确率和F1分数。

Conclusion: 研究首次探索了人类认知因素对AL的影响，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: This study centers on overcoming the challenge of selecting the best
annotators for each query in Active Learning (AL), with the objective of
minimizing misclassifications. AL recognizes the challenges related to cost and
time when acquiring labeled data, and decreases the number of labeled data
needed. Nevertheless, there is still the necessity to reduce annotation errors,
aiming to be as efficient as possible, to achieve the expected accuracy faster.
Most strategies for query-annotator pairs do not consider internal factors that
affect productivity, such as mood, attention, motivation, and fatigue levels.
This work addresses this gap in the existing literature, by not only
considering how the internal factors influence annotators (mood and fatigue
levels) but also presenting a new query-annotator pair strategy, using a
Knowledge-Based Recommendation System (RS). The RS ranks the available
annotators, allowing to choose one or more to label the queried instance using
their past accuracy values, and their mood and fatigue levels, as well as
information about the instance queried. This work bases itself on existing
literature on mood and fatigue influence on human performance, simulating
annotators in a realistic manner, and predicting their performance with the RS.
The results show that considering past accuracy values, as well as mood and
fatigue levels reduces the number of annotation errors made by the annotators,
and the uncertainty of the model through its training, when compared to not
using internal factors. Accuracy and F1-score values were also better in the
proposed approach, despite not being as substantial as the aforementioned. The
methodologies and findings presented in this study begin to explore the open
challenge of human cognitive factors affecting AL.

TL;DR: CODA提出了一种主动模型选择方法，通过候选模型的预测结果优先标注能高效区分最佳模型的数据点，显著减少标注工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型选择需要大量标注验证数据，成本高且耗时，CODA旨在通过主动学习减少标注需求。

Method: CODA基于概率框架建模模型、类别和数据点间的关系，利用共识和分歧指导标注，并通过贝叶斯推断更新模型选择。

Result: 在26个基准任务上，CODA比现有方法减少70%以上的标注工作量。

Conclusion: CODA是一种高效的主动模型选择方法，显著降低了标注成本。

Abstract: The widespread availability of off-the-shelf machine learning models poses a
challenge: which model, of the many available candidates, should be chosen for
a given data analysis task? This question of model selection is traditionally
answered by collecting and annotating a validation dataset -- a costly and
time-intensive process. We propose a method for active model selection, using
predictions from candidate models to prioritize the labeling of test data
points that efficiently differentiate the best candidate. Our method, CODA,
performs consensus-driven active model selection by modeling relationships
between classifiers, categories, and data points within a probabilistic
framework. The framework uses the consensus and disagreement between models in
the candidate pool to guide the label acquisition process, and Bayesian
inference to update beliefs about which model is best as more information is
collected. We validate our approach by curating a collection of 26 benchmark
tasks capturing a range of model selection scenarios. CODA outperforms existing
methods for active model selection significantly, reducing the annotation
effort required to discover the best model by upwards of 70% compared to the
previous state-of-the-art. Code and data are available at

Conclusion: 本文为KGC解释性研究提供了统一的方法和评价标准，使其更具可重复性和实际意义。

Abstract: Post-hoc explainability for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) lacks
formalization and consistent evaluations, hindering reproducibility and
cross-study comparisons. This paper argues for a unified approach to post-hoc
explainability in KGC. First, we propose a general framework to characterize
post-hoc explanations via multi-objective optimization, balancing their
effectiveness and conciseness. This unifies existing post-hoc explainability
algorithms in KGC and the explanations they produce. Next, we suggest and
empirically support improved evaluation protocols using popular metrics like
Mean Reciprocal Rank and Hits@$k$. Finally, we stress the importance of
interpretability as the ability of explanations to address queries meaningful
to end-users. By unifying methods and refining evaluation standards, this work
aims to make research in KGC explainability more reproducible and impactful.

Abstract: This paper examines how Data Readiness for AI (DRAI) principles apply to
leadership-scale scientific datasets used to train foundation models. We
analyze archetypal workflows across four representative domains - climate,
nuclear fusion, bio/health, and materials - to identify common preprocessing
patterns and domain-specific constraints. We introduce a two-dimensional

Data Processing Stages (ingest to shard), both tailored to high performance

transforming scientific data for scalable AI training, emphasizing
transformer-based generative models. Together, these dimensions form a
conceptual maturity matrix that characterizes scientific data readiness and

Result: 强化学习训练的1:4混合比例能将刻板印象评分降低10%，同时保留88%的原始推理准确性。

Conclusion: 研究为平衡多模态大语言模型的公平性与能力提供了具体指导。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) already achieve state-of-the-art
results across a wide range of tasks and modalities. To push their reasoning
ability further, recent studies explore advanced prompting schemes and
post-training fine-tuning. Although these techniques improve logical accuracy,
they frequently leave the models' outputs burdened with pronounced social
biases. Clarifying how reasoning gains interact with bias mitigation-and
whether the two objectives inherently trade off-therefore remains an open and
pressing research problem. Our study begins by benchmarking three
bias-mitigation strategies-supervised fine-uning (SFT), knowledge distillation
(KD), and rule-based reinforcement learning (RL)-under identical conditions,
establishing their baseline strengths and weaknesses. Building on these
results, we vary the proportion of debias-focused and reasoning-centric samples
within each paradigm to chart the reasoning-versus-bias trade-off. Our sweeps
reveal a consistent sweet spot: a roughly 1:4 mix trained with reinforcement
learning cuts stereotype scores by 10% while retaining 88% of the model's
original reasoning accuracy, offering concrete guidance for balancing fairness
and capability in MLLMs.

Motivation: 受Moravec悖论启发，研究旨在量化AI与人类在听觉任务上的差距，并探索失败原因。

Method: 设计了包含917个挑战的听觉图灵测试，涵盖七类任务，评估了GPT-4和Whisper等先进模型。

Result: AI模型平均准确率仅6.9%，远低于人类的52%，揭示了其在复杂听觉场景中的根本缺陷。

Conclusion: 研究为衡量AI听觉进步提供了框架，并指出需整合选择性注意力、物理音频理解和上下文感知的新方法。

Abstract: This research work demonstrates that current AI systems fail catastrophically
on auditory tasks that humans perform effortlessly. Drawing inspiration from
Moravec's paradox (i.e., tasks simple for humans often prove difficult for
machines, and vice versa), we introduce an auditory Turing test comprising 917
challenges across seven categories: overlapping speech, speech in noise,
temporal distortion, spatial audio, coffee-shop noise, phone distortion, and
perceptual illusions. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art audio models including
GPT-4's audio capabilities and OpenAI's Whisper reveals a striking failure rate
exceeding 93%, with even the best-performing model achieving only 6.9% accuracy
on tasks that humans solved at 7.5 times higher success (52%). These results
expose focusing failures in how AI systems process complex auditory scenes,
particularly in selective attention, noise robustness, and contextual
adaptation. Our benchmark not only quantifies the human-machine auditory gap
but also provides insights into why these failures occur, suggesting that
current architectures lack fundamental mechanisms for human-like auditory scene
analysis. The traditional design of audio CAPTCHAs highlights common filters
that humans evolved but machines fail to select in multimodal language models.
This work establishes a diagnostic framework for measuring progress toward
human-level machine listening and highlights the need for novel approaches
integrating selective attention, physics-based audio understanding, and
context-aware perception into multimodal AI systems.

Motivation: 研究论证一致性在判断性预测中的价值，探索其对人类和LLM预测准确性的影响，以及用户对此的认知。

Method: 形式化定义论证一致性，通过实验评估其对人类和LLM预测的影响，并进行用户实验验证用户行为。

Result: 过滤不一致预测显著提高准确性，但用户普遍未遵循一致性。

Conclusion: 论证一致性对预测准确性有实际价值，需在群体预测中过滤不一致观点。

Abstract: Judgmental forecasting employs human opinions to make predictions about
future events, rather than exclusively historical data as in quantitative
forecasting. When these opinions form an argumentative structure around
forecasts, it is useful to study the properties of the forecasts from an
argumentative perspective. In this paper, we advocate and formally define a
property of argumentative coherence, which, in essence, requires that a
forecaster's reasoning is coherent with their forecast. We then conduct three
evaluations with our notion of coherence. First, we assess the impact of
enforcing coherence on human forecasters as well as on Large Language Model
(LLM)-based forecasters, given that they have recently shown to be competitive
with human forecasters. In both cases, we show that filtering out incoherent
predictions improves forecasting accuracy consistently, supporting the
practical value of coherence in both human and LLM-based forecasting. Then, via
crowd-sourced user experiments, we show that, despite its apparent
intuitiveness and usefulness, users do not generally align with this coherence
property. This points to the need to integrate, within argumentation-based
judgmental forecasting, mechanisms to filter out incoherent opinions before
obtaining group forecasting predictions.

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于Shapley值的责任度量（WSMS）在ontology-mediated查询回答中的计算复杂性，发现其在某些查询类中具有多项式数据复杂性，而在其他情况下则表现出计算困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化查询答案中各事实的贡献是解释性数据分析的重要任务，而WSMS作为一种新的责任度量方法，其计算复杂性尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过利用数据库设置的结果，分析WSMS在不同ontology语言和查询类中的计算复杂性，包括数据复杂性和组合复杂性。

Result: 对于first-order-rewritable查询类，WSMS具有多项式数据复杂性；但在支持特定语法（如存在量词）的ontology语言中，问题变为shP-hard。此外，某些受限查询类在DL-Lite方言中仍保持可处理性。

Conclusion: WSMS的计算复杂性取决于查询和ontology语言的结构，研究为设计高效算法提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Recent work on quantitative approaches to explaining query answers employs
responsibility measures to assign scores to facts in order to quantify their
respective contributions to obtaining a given answer. In this paper, we study
the complexity of computing such responsibility scores in the setting of
ontology-mediated query answering, focusing on a very recently introduced
family of Shapley-value-based responsibility measures defined in terms of
weighted sums of minimal supports (WSMS). By exploiting results from the
database setting, we can show that such measures enjoy polynomial data
complexity for classes of ontology-mediated queries that are
first-order-rewritable, whereas the problem becomes "shP"-hard when the
ontology language can encode reachability queries (via axioms like $\exists R.
A \sqsubseteq A$). To better understand the tractability frontier, we next
explore the combined complexity of WSMS computation. We prove that
intractability applies already to atomic queries if the ontology language
supports conjunction, as well as to unions of `well-behaved' conjunctive
queries, even in the absence of an ontology. By contrast, our study yields
positive results for common DL-Lite dialects: by means of careful analysis, we
identify classes of structurally restricted conjunctive queries (which
intuitively disallow undesirable interactions between query atoms) that admit
tractable WSMS computation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的解决方案感知ReLU评分方法（SAS），结合部分MILP调用，显著减少了二进制变量的使用，提升了验证效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理复杂实例时，传统方法使用少量复杂的BaB调用效率不高，需要更优的ReLU变量选择方法。

Method: 提出SAS评分方法，并结合BaB-SR和BaB-FSB分支函数作为全局ReLU评分（GS），通过部分MILP调用分解复杂性。

Result: SAS将二进制变量数量减少约6倍，同时保持相同精度；混合MILP实现减少了40%未决实例，平均运行时间合理。

Conclusion: SAS方法在效率和准确性上优于传统方法，适用于大规模CNN验证。

Abstract: To handle complex instances, we revisit a divide-and-conquer approach to
break down the complexity: instead of few complex BaB calls, we rely on many
small {\em partial} MILP calls. The crucial step is to select very few but very
important ReLUs to treat using (costly) binary variables. The previous attempts
were suboptimal in that respect. To select these important ReLU variables, we
propose a novel {\em solution-aware} ReLU scoring ({\sf SAS}), as well as adapt
the BaB-SR and BaB-FSB branching functions as {\em global} ReLU scoring ({\sf
GS}) functions. We compare them theoretically as well as experimentally, and
{\sf SAS} is more efficient at selecting a set of variables to open using
binary variables. Compared with previous attempts, SAS reduces the number of
binary variables by around 6 times, while maintaining the same level of
accuracy. Implemented in {\em Hybrid MILP}, calling first $\alpha,\beta$-CROWN
with a short time-out to solve easier instances, and then partial MILP,
produces a very accurate yet efficient verifier, reducing by up to $40\%$ the
number of undecided instances to low levels ($8-15\%$), while keeping a
reasonable runtime ($46s-417s$ on average per instance), even for fairly large
CNNs with 2 million parameters.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) is propelling automated
scientific discovery to the next level, with LLM-based Artificial Intelligence
(AI) Scientist systems now taking the lead in scientific research. Several
influential works have already appeared in the field of AI Scientist systems,
with AI-generated research papers having been accepted at the ICLR 2025
workshop, suggesting that a human-level AI Scientist capable of uncovering
phenomena previously unknown to humans, may soon become a reality. In this
survey, we focus on the central question: How far are AI scientists from
changing the world and reshaping the scientific research paradigm? To answer
this question, we provide a prospect-driven review that comprehensively
analyzes the current achievements of AI Scientist systems, identifying key
bottlenecks and the critical components required for the emergence of a
scientific agent capable of producing ground-breaking discoveries that solve
grand challenges. We hope this survey will contribute to a clearer
understanding of limitations of current AI Scientist systems, showing where we
are, what is missing, and what the ultimate goals for scientific AI should be.

Result: 提出3级自主AI分类，强调完全自主AI（第3级）的风险，支持人类监督的立场。

Conclusion: AI不应完全自主，人类监督是降低风险的关键。

Abstract: Autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) has many benefits. It also has many
risks. In this work, we identify the 3 levels of autonomous AI. We are of the
position that AI must not be fully autonomous because of the many risks,
especially as artificial superintelligence (ASI) is speculated to be just
decades away. Fully autonomous AI, which can develop its own objectives, is at
level 3 and without responsible human oversight. However, responsible human
oversight is crucial for mitigating the risks. To ague for our position, we
discuss theories of autonomy, AI and agents. Then, we offer 12 distinct
arguments and 6 counterarguments with rebuttals to the counterarguments. We
also present 15 pieces of recent evidence of AI misaligned values and other
risks in the appendix.

context engineering, multi-step with context engineering, and with SmolAgent.
Our benchmark assesses performance across a diverse set of eight data science
task categories, additionally exploring the sensitivity of models to common
prompting issues, such as data leakage and slightly ambiguous instructions. We
further investigate the influence of temperature parameters on overall and
task-specific outcomes for each model and approach. Our findings reveal
distinct performance disparities among the evaluated models and methodologies,
highlighting critical factors that affect practical deployment. The benchmark

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly reshaped different walks of
business. To meet the increasing demands for individualized railway service, we
develop LLM4Rail - a novel LLM-augmented railway service consulting platform.
Empowered by LLM, LLM4Rail can provide custom modules for ticketing, railway
food & drink recommendations, weather information, and chitchat. In LLM4Rail,
we propose the iterative "Question-Thought-Action-Observation (QTAO)" prompting
framework. It meticulously integrates verbal reasoning with task-oriented
actions, that is, reasoning to guide action selection, to effectively retrieve
external observations relevant to railway operation and service to generate
accurate responses. To provide personalized onboard dining services, we first
construct the Chinese Railway Food and Drink (CRFD-25) - a publicly accessible
takeout dataset tailored for railway services. CRFD-25 covers a wide range of
signature dishes categorized by cities, cuisines, age groups, and spiciness
levels. We further introduce an LLM-based zero-shot conversational recommender
for railway catering. To address the unconstrained nature of open
recommendations, the feature similarity-based post-processing step is
introduced to ensure all the recommended items are aligned with CRFD-25
dataset.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with instruction following capabilities have
demonstrated impressive problem-solving abilities. While synthesizing
instructional data from unsupervised text has become a common approach for
training such models, conventional methods rely heavily on human effort for
data annotation. Although existing automated synthesis paradigms have
alleviated this constraint, they still exhibit significant limitations in
ensuring adequate diversity and difficulty of synthesized instructions. To
address these challenges, we propose Self-Foveate, an innovative LLM-driven
method for instruction synthesis. This approach introduces a
"Micro-Scatter-Macro" multi-level foveation methodology that effectively guides
the LLM to deeply excavate fine-grained information embedded in unsupervised
text, thereby enhancing both the diversity and difficulty of synthesized
instructions. Comprehensive experiments across multiple unsupervised corpora
and diverse model architectures validate the effectiveness and superiority of
our proposed method. We publicly release our data and codes:

Motivation: 因果推理是大型语言模型的核心挑战之一，传统模型在数据扰动下表现不佳，因此研究基于推理的架构能否稳健地完成因果发现任务。

Method: 使用Corr2Cause基准测试OpenAI的o系列和DeepSeek-R模型家族，并引入基于Tree-of-Thoughts和Chain-of-Thoughts的模块化上下文管道。

Conclusion: 高级推理模型在因果发现中具有显著优势，但需结合结构化上下文框架以最大化其潜力，为跨领域因果发现提供通用方案。

Abstract: Causal inference remains a fundamental challenge for large language models.
Recent advances in internal reasoning with large language models have sparked
interest in whether state-of-the-art reasoning models can robustly perform
causal discovery-a task where conventional models often suffer from severe
overfitting and near-random performance under data perturbations. We study
causal discovery on the Corr2Cause benchmark using the emergent OpenAI's
o-series and DeepSeek-R model families and find that these reasoning-first
architectures achieve significantly greater native gains than prior approaches.
To capitalize on these strengths, we introduce a modular in-context pipeline
inspired by the Tree-of-Thoughts and Chain-of-Thoughts methodologies, yielding
nearly three-fold improvements over conventional baselines. We further probe
the pipeline's impact by analyzing reasoning chain length, complexity, and
conducting qualitative and quantitative comparisons between conventional and
reasoning models. Our findings suggest that while advanced reasoning models
represent a substantial leap forward, carefully structured in-context
frameworks are essential to maximize their capabilities and offer a
generalizable blueprint for causal discovery across diverse domains.

Result: 实验显示不同模型在充分性、对比性和完整性上表现不同，算法高效且无需模型内部信息。

Conclusion: 因果解释兼具形式严谨性和实用性，适用于黑盒图像分类器。

Abstract: Existing algorithms for explaining the outputs of image classifiers are based
on a variety of approaches and produce explanations that lack formal rigor. On
the other hand, logic-based explanations are formally and rigorously defined
but their computability relies on strict assumptions about the model that do
not hold on image classifiers.
  In this paper, we show that causal explanations, in addition to being
formally and rigorously defined, enjoy the same formal properties as
logic-based ones, while still lending themselves to black-box algorithms and
being a natural fit for image classifiers. We prove formal properties of causal
explanations and introduce contrastive causal explanations for image
classifiers. Moreover, we augment the definition of explanation with confidence
awareness and introduce complete causal explanations: explanations that are
classified with exactly the same confidence as the original image.
  We implement our definitions, and our experimental results demonstrate that
different models have different patterns of sufficiency, contrastiveness, and
completeness. Our algorithms are efficiently computable, taking on average 6s
per image on a ResNet50 model to compute all types of explanations, and are
totally black-box, needing no knowledge of the model, no access to model
internals, no access to gradient, nor requiring any properties, such as
monotonicity, of the model.

Abstract: Large language model-based agents, empowered by in-context learning (ICL),
have demonstrated strong capabilities in complex reasoning and tool-use tasks.
However, existing works have shown that the effectiveness of ICL is highly
sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, with suboptimal examples often
leading to unstable or degraded performance. While prior work has explored
example selection, including in some agentic or multi-step settings, existing
approaches typically rely on heuristics or task-specific designs and lack a
general, theoretically grounded criterion for what constitutes an effective
demonstration across reasoning steps. Therefore, it is non-trivial to develop a
principled, general-purpose method for selecting demonstrations that
consistently benefit agent performance. In this paper, we address this
challenge with DICE, Dynamic In-Context Example Selection for LLM Agents, a
theoretically grounded ICL framework for agentic tasks that selects the most
relevant demonstrations at each step of reasoning. Our approach decomposes
demonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components
through a causal lens, showing how the latter can introduce spurious
dependencies that impair generalization. We further propose a stepwise
selection criterion with a formal guarantee of improved agent performance.
Importantly, DICE is a general, framework-agnostic solution that can be
integrated as a plug-in module into existing agentic frameworks without any
additional training cost. Extensive experiments across diverse domains
demonstrate our method's effectiveness and generality, highlighting the
importance of principled, context-aware demo selection for robust and efficient
LLM agents.

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了评估开销与信任准确性，提高了分布式协作的资源利用率。

Abstract: In collaborative systems, the effective completion of tasks hinges on
task-specific trust evaluations of potential devices for distributed
collaboration. However, the complexity of tasks, the spatiotemporal dynamism of
distributed device resources, and the inevitable assessment overhead
dramatically increase the complexity and resource consumption of the trust
evaluation process. As a result, ill-timed or overly frequent trust evaluations
can reduce utilization rate of constrained resources, negatively affecting
collaborative task execution. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an
autonomous trust orchestration method based on a new concept of semantic
chain-of-trust. Our technique employs agentic AI and hypergraph to establish
and maintain trust relationships among devices. By leveraging its strengths in
autonomous perception, task decomposition, and semantic reasoning, we propose
agentic AI to perceive device states and autonomously perform trust evaluations
of collaborators based on historical performance data only during device idle
periods, thereby enabling efficient utilization of distributed resources. In
addition, agentic AI performs task-specific trust evaluations on collaborator
resources by analyzing the alignment between resource capabilities and task
requirements. Moreover, by maintaining a trust hypergraph embedded with trust
semantics for each device, agentic AI enables hierarchical management of
collaborators and identifies collaborators requiring trust evaluation based on
trust semantics, thereby achieving a balance between overhead and trust
accuracy. Furthermore, local trust hypergraphs from multiple devices can be
chained together to support multi-hop collaboration, enabling efficient
coordination in large-scale systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves resource-efficient trust evaluation.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了记忆回忆中的策略选择和响应生成问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Agent-assisted memory recall is one critical research problem in the field of
human-computer interaction. In conventional methods, the agent can retrieve
information from its equipped memory module to help the person recall
incomplete or vague memories. The limited size of memory module hinders the
acquisition of complete memories and impacts the memory recall performance in
practice. Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be
proactively activated through some effective cues. Inspired by this, we propose
a novel strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, allowing the agent
to transform an original query into a cue-rich one via the judiciously designed
strategy to help the person recall memories. To this end, there are two key
challenges. (1) How to choose the appropriate recall strategy for diverse
forgetting scenarios with distinct memory-recall characteristics? (2) How to
obtain the high-quality responses leveraging recall strategies, given only
abstract and sparsely annotated strategy patterns? To address the challenges,
we propose a Recall Router framework. Specifically, we design a 5W Recall Map
to classify memory queries into five typical scenarios and define fifteen
recall strategy patterns across the corresponding scenarios. We then propose a
hierarchical recall tree combined with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to
optimize the selection of strategy and the generation of strategy responses. We
construct an instruction tuning dataset and fine-tune multiple open-source
large language models (LLMs) to develop MemoCue, an agent that excels in
providing memory-inspired responses. Experiments on three representative
datasets show that MemoCue surpasses LLM-based methods by 17.74% in recall
inspiration. Further human evaluation highlights its advantages in
memory-recall applications.

through questions to enhance their mastery of learning targets. Most previous
methods model this task as a Markov Decision Process and use reinforcement
learning to solve, but they struggle with efficient exploration, failing to
identify the best questions for each student during training. To address this,
we propose Ranking Alignment Recommendation (RAR), which incorporates
collaborative ideas into the exploration mechanism, enabling more efficient
exploration within limited training episodes. Experiments show that RAR
effectively improves recommendation performance, and our framework can be
applied to any RL-based question recommender. Our code is available in

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents within complex, interactive environments that mirror
real-world challenges is critical for understanding their practical
capabilities. While existing agent benchmarks effectively assess skills like
tool use or performance on structured tasks, they often do not fully capture an
agent's ability to operate autonomously in exploratory environments that demand
sustained, self-directed reasoning over a long and growing context. To spur the
development of agents capable of more robust intrinsic reasoning over long
horizons, we introduce TextQuests, a benchmark based on the Infocom suite of
interactive fiction games. These text-based adventures, which can take human
players over 30 hours and require hundreds of precise actions to solve, serve
as an effective proxy for evaluating AI agents on focused, stateful tasks. The
benchmark is specifically designed to assess an LLM agent's capacity for
self-contained problem-solving by precluding the use of external tools, thereby
focusing on intrinsic long-context reasoning capabilities in an exploratory
environment characterized by the need for trial-and-error learning and
sustained problem-solving within a single interactive session. We release
TextQuests at https://textquests.ai.

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning abilities by leveraging
reinforcement learning with long chain-of-thought, yet they continue to
struggle with theorem proving due to the lack of clear supervision signals when
solely using natural language. Dedicated domain-specific languages like Lean
provide clear supervision via formal verification of proofs, enabling effective
training through reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose
\textbf{Seed-Prover}, a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model. Seed-Prover
can iteratively refine its proof based on Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and
self-summarization. To solve IMO-level contest problems, we design three
test-time inference strategies that enable both deep and broad reasoning.
Seed-Prover proves $78.1\%$ of formalized past IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F,
and achieves over 50\% on PutnamBench, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art by a large margin. To address the lack of geometry support in
Lean, we introduce a geometry reasoning engine \textbf{Seed-Geometry}, which
outperforms previous formal geometry engines. We use these two systems to
participate in IMO 2025 and fully prove 5 out of 6 problems. This work
represents a significant advancement in automated mathematical reasoning,
demonstrating the effectiveness of formal verification with long
chain-of-thought reasoning.

Abstract: AI agents built on large language models (LLMs) hold enormous promise, but
current practice focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls
short of scalability and generality, but also suffers from the fundamental
limitations of autoregressive LLMs. On the other hand, humans are general
agents who reason by mentally simulating the outcomes of their actions and
plans. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce
SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based
on a principled formulation of optimal agent in any environment, \modelname
overcomes the limitations of autoregressive reasoning by introducing a world
model for planning via simulation. The generalized world model is implemented
using LLM, which can flexibly plan in a wide range of environments using the
concept-rich latent space of natural language. Experiments on difficult web
browsing tasks show that \modelname improves the success of flight search from
0\% to 32.2\%. World-model-based planning, in particular, shows consistent
advantage of up to 124\% over autoregressive planning, demonstrating the
advantage of world model simulation as a reasoning paradigm. We are excited
about the possibility for training a single, general agent model based on LLMs
that can act superintelligently in all environments. To start, we make SimuRA,
a web-browsing agent built on \modelname with pretrained LLMs, available as a
research demo for public testing.

### [251] [Rethink Domain Generalization in Heterogeneous Sequence MRI Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23110)

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了PancreasDG数据集，用于研究医学影像中的领域泛化问题，重点关注胰腺分割的挑战。通过多中心MRI数据，分析了跨中心和跨序列的变异性，并提出了一种半监督方法，显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺分割在腹部成像中具有挑战性，且现有领域泛化基准忽视了序列间的变异性。胰腺在临床中的重要性（如癌症检测和糖尿病研究）促使了该数据集的创建。

Method: 使用来自六个机构的563个MRI扫描，涵盖静脉期和非同期序列，通过双盲两遍协议生成精确的胰腺掩码。提出了一种利用解剖不变性的半监督方法。

Result: 研究发现：(i)有限采样引入显著方差；(ii)跨中心性能与源域性能相关；(iii)跨序列偏移需要专门解决方案。半监督方法在Dice分数上显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: PancreasDG为医学影像领域泛化设置了新基准，数据集和代码将公开，推动进一步研究。

Abstract: Clinical magnetic-resonance (MR) protocols generate many T1 and T2 sequences
whose appearance differs more than the acquisition sites that produce them.
Existing domain-generalization benchmarks focus almost on cross-center shifts
and overlook this dominant source of variability. Pancreas segmentation remains
a major challenge in abdominal imaging: the gland is small, irregularly,
surrounded by organs and fat, and often suffers from low T1 contrast.
State-of-the-art deep networks that already achieve >90% Dice on the liver or
kidneys still miss 20-30% of the pancreas. The organ is also systematically
under-represented in public cross-domain benchmarks, despite its clinical
importance in early cancer detection, surgery, and diabetes research. To close
this gap, we present PancreasDG, a large-scale multi-center 3D MRI pancreas
segmentation dataset for investigating domain generalization in medical
imaging. The dataset comprises 563 MRI scans from six institutions, spanning
both venous phase and out-of-phase sequences, enabling study of both
cross-center and cross-sequence variations with pixel-accurate pancreas masks
created by a double-blind, two-pass protocol. Through comprehensive analysis,
we reveal three insights: (i) limited sampling introduces significant variance
that may be mistaken for distribution shifts, (ii) cross-center performance
correlates with source domain performance for identical sequences, and (iii)
cross-sequence shifts require specialized solutions. We also propose a
semi-supervised approach that leverages anatomical invariances, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques with 61.63%
Dice score improvements and 87.00% on two test centers for cross-sequence
segmentation. PancreasDG sets a new benchmark for domain generalization in
medical imaging. Dataset, code, and models will be available at

Abstract: High-resolution satellite imagery is essential for geospatial analysis, yet
differences in spatial resolution across satellite sensors present challenges
for data fusion and downstream applications. Super-resolution techniques can
help bridge this gap, but existing methods rely on artificially downscaled
images rather than real sensor data and are not well suited for heterogeneous
satellite sensors with differing spectral, temporal characteristics. In this
work, we develop a preliminary framework to align and Harmonized Landsat
Sentinel 30m(HLS 30) imagery using Harmonized Landsat Sentinel 10m(HLS10) as a
reference from the HLS dataset. Our approach aims to bridge the resolution gap
between these sensors and improve the quality of super-resolved Landsat
imagery. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method, showing its potential for enhancing satellite-based sensing
applications. This study provides insights into the feasibility of
heterogeneous satellite image super-resolution and highlights key
considerations for future advancements in the field.

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种半经验模型，用于预测高雷诺数下湍流边界层、管道和通道中的壁面压力谱，解决了传统模型在亚对流区域的能量增长预测不足和方差高估的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型（如Goody模型）在高雷诺数下无法准确捕捉亚对流区域的能量增长，同时高估了方差。为了解决这些问题，研究提出了新的模型。

Method: 提出了两种基于内尺度运动和外尺度运动贡献的半经验模型。第一种模型将预乘谱表示为两个重叠对数正态分布的和；第二种模型利用理论参数化内、外尺度运动的谱形状。

Result: 两种模型均能准确捕捉全谱及其方差的对数增长，为工程预测提供了更准确的壁面压力波动模型。

Conclusion: 新模型解决了传统模型的不足，为高雷诺数下的壁面压力波动预测提供了更可靠的基础。

Abstract: Wall-pressure fluctuations beneath turbulent boundary layers drive noise and
structural fatigue through interactions between fluid and structural modes.
Conventional predictive models for the spectrum--such as the widely accepted
Goody model--fail to capture the energetic growth in the subconvective regime
that occurs at high Reynolds number, while at the same time over-predicting the
variance.
  To address these shortcomings, two semi-empirical models are proposed for the
wall-pressure spectrum in canonical turbulent boundary layers, pipes and
channels for friction Reynolds numbers $\delta^+$ ranging from 180 to 47 000.
  The models are based on consideration of two eddy populations that broadly
represent the contributions to the wall pressure fluctuations from inner-scale
motions and outer-scale motions.
  The first model expresses the premultiplied spectrum as the sum of two
overlapping log-normal populations: an inner-scaled term that is
$\delta^+$-invariant and an outer-scaled term whose amplitude broadens smoothly
with $\delta^+$. Calibrated against large-eddy simulations, direct numerical
simulations, and recent high-$\delta^+$ pipe data, it reproduces the convective
ridge and the emergence of a sub-convective ridge at large $\delta^+$.
  The second model, developed around newly-available pipe data, uses
theoretical arguments to prescribe the spectral shapes of the inner and outer
populations. By embedding the $\delta^+$ dependence in smooth asymptotic
functions, it yields a formulation that varies continuously with $\delta^+$.
  Both models capture the full spectrum and the logarithmic growth of its
variance, laying the groundwork for more accurate engineering predictions of
wall-pressure fluctuations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索聚合物浓度和Deborah数如何影响稀悬浮液的拉伸流变行为，特别是局部流变和粘度变化。

Method: 通过计算模拟研究稀悬浮液中球体在粘弹性液体中的行为，分析局部速度梯度、聚合物拉伸和Deborah数的变化。

Result: 低Deborah数时，聚合物拉伸增加悬浮液粘度；高Deborah数时，聚合物塌陷降低粘度。高浓度时，粒子-聚合物相互作用导致负应力，显著降低粘度。

Conclusion: 稀球体悬浮液在高Deborah数和高聚合物浓度下能更有效地降低粘弹性液体的粘度。

Abstract: The extensional rheology of dilute suspensions of spheres in viscoelastic or
polymeric liquids is studied computationally. At low polymer concentration (c)
and Deborah number (De), a wake of highly stretched polymers forms downstream
of the particles due to larger local velocity gradients than the imposed flow,
indicated by a positive deviation in local De. This increases the suspension's
extensional viscosity with time and De for De less than 0.5. When De exceeds
0.5 (the coil-stretch transition), the fully stretched polymers from the far
field collapse in regions with lower local velocity gradients around the
particle's stagnation points, reducing suspension viscosity relative to the
polymer-only liquid. The interaction between local flow and polymers
intensifies with increasing c. Highly stretched polymers impede local flow,
reducing local De, while it increases in regions with collapsed polymers.
Initially, increasing c aligns local De and polymer stretch with far-field
values, diminishing particle-polymer interaction effects. However, beyond a
certain c, a new mechanism emerges. At low c, fluid three particle radii
upstream exhibits increased local De, stretching polymers beyond their
undisturbed state. As c increases, this deviation becomes negative, collapsing
polymers and resulting in increasingly negative stress from particle-polymer
interactions at large De and time. At high c, this negative interaction stress
scales as c squared, surpassing the linear increase in polymer stress, making
dilute sphere suspensions more effective at reducing the viscosity of
viscoelastic liquids at larger De and c.

Abstract: Time-varying flow-induced forces on bodies immersed in fluid flows play a key
role across a range of natural and engineered systems, from biological
locomotion to propulsion and energy-harvesting devices. These transient forces
often arise from complex, dynamic vortex interactions and can either enhance or
degrade system performance. However, establishing a clear causal link between
vortex structures and force transients remains challenging, especially in
high-Reynolds number nominally three-dimensional flows. In this study, we
investigate the unsteady lift generation on a rotor blade that is impulsively
started with a span-based Reynolds number of 25,500. The lift history from this
direct-numerical simulation reveals distinct early-time extrema associated with
rapidly evolving flow structures, including the formation, evolution, and
breakdown of leading-edge and tip vortices. To quantify the influence of these
vortical structures on the lift transients, we apply the force partitioning
method (FPM) that quantifies the surface pressure forces induced by
vortex-associated effects. Two metrics - $Q$-strength and vortex proximity -
are derived from FPM to provide a quantitative assessment of the influence of
vortices on the lift force. This analysis confirms and extends qualitative
insights from prior studies, and offers a simple-to-apply data-enabled
framework for attributing unsteady forces to specific flow features, with
potential applications in the design and control of systems where unsteady
aerodynamic forces play a central role.

Conclusion: 带状急流中的涡度界面表现出复杂的统计行为，揭示了湍流流动中界面的非平凡特性。

Abstract: Zonal jets manifest themselves as bands with sharp interfaces in the
vorticity configuration. We develop an algorithm to track these fluctuating
vorticity interfaces and systematically investigate their characteristic
spatio-temporal behavior. While the interfacial height fluctuations are
typically sub-Gaussian, the corresponding $\textit{fluctuation speeds}$ exhibit
wider, heavy-tailed distributions reflecting the influence of lateral
dispersion induced by the zonal velocity profile along the interfacial
contours. The temporal evolution of these fluctuations is further characterized
through their power spectrum displaying scale invariance in the frequency
domain. The sharp, dense, shock-like features present in the time series of the
$\textit{height}$ field suggest a possible lacking of differentiability. We
confirm this by calculating the moments of the time-increments of the
interfacial height fluctuations. Finally, the fractal nature of these
boundaries is investigated systematically through a multifractal approach,
revealing the non-trivial, complex statistics of interfaces in such
geophysical, turbulent flows.

Abstract: A wide range of natural and engineered fluid flows exhibit spatial or
temporal viscosity variations, spanning scales from microbial locomotion to
planetary mantle convection. These variations introduce qualitatively new
physical mechanisms absent in constant-viscosity flows. This review surveys
such phenomena across scales. In low Reynolds number (Stokes) flows, viscosity
gradients couple translation and rotation, enabling novel particle responses to
uniform forcing-- mechanisms that microorganisms may exploit. In shear flows,
viscosity variation alters base flow profiles and breaks symmetries, modifying
stability and transition dynamics. At high Reynolds numbers, stratification
fundamentally changes the singular perturbation structure governing energy
production, enhancing or suppressing canonical instabilities and introducing
new ones. Viscosity variation also affects nonnormal growth and nonlinear
interactions that drive transition to turbulence. While laminar and fully
developed turbulence have been extensively studied, transitional processes
remain poorly understood in variable-viscosity flows. In turbulent regimes,
viscosity variation impacts jets, wall-bounded flows, and mixing layers. At
geophysical scales, incorporating eddy viscosity stratification in climate
models may improve predictions, while in Earth's mantle, viscosity contrasts
drive large-scale convection and geological evolution. Particle-laden flows,
common across contexts, can generate effective viscosity stratification through
inhomogeneous loading. Throughout, we highlight cases where viscosity variation
alters flow behavior qualitatively, and point to open questions. This review
aims to guide graduate students and researchers toward tractable,
cross-disciplinary problems.

Abstract: This study investigates the effect of surface dimples on the unsteady
aerodynamics of a National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics airfoil
(NACA0012) at a chord-based Reynolds numbers of $Re_c = 5300$ and $10{,}000$
using direct numerical simulations. Dimples were placed on the suction side at
non-dimensional chordwise locations of $l_D/c = 0.035$ and $0.35$, and the flow
response was studied at a fixed angle of attack $\alpha = 5^\circ$. At $Re_c =
5300$, dimples placed at $l_D/c = 0.35$ reduced lift and drag fluctuations by
$26.5\%$ and $33.3\%$, respectively, with minimal change in mean forces. At
$Re_c = 10{,}000$, the same configuration led to a seven-fold increase in force
fluctuations, while the mean remained unchanged. The smooth airfoil exhibited
irregular, aperiodic force signals at this $Re_c$, whereas the dimpled case
showed highly periodic behavior, indicating wake stabilization. Flow
visualizations revealed that dimples generate streamwise vortices within the
boundary layer. These vortices are found to have a stabilizing effect on wake
dynamics at $Re_c = 5300$, reducing vortex breakdown and enhancing the
coherence of wake structures. Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (SPOD)
showed that dimples redistribute modal energy depending on Reynolds number: at
low $Re_c$, they reduce broadband content and suppress unsteadiness, while at
high $Re_c$, they amplify dominant shedding modes and broaden the spectral
energy distribution. These results demonstrate that dimples can passively
modulate unsteady forces and wake dynamics for a flow over a streamlined body,
either suppressing or enhancing flow instabilities depending on the regime.

Abstract: We introduce CFDagent, a zero-shot, multi-agent system that enables fully
autonomous computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations from natural language
prompts. CFDagent integrates three specialized LLM-driven agents: (i) the
Preprocessing Agent that generates 3D geometries from textual or visual inputs
using a hybrid text-to-3D diffusion model (Point-E) and automatically meshes
the geometries; (ii) the Solver Agent that configures and executes an immersed
boundary flow solver; and (iii) the Postprocessing Agent that analyzes and
visualizes the results, including multimodal renderings. These agents are
interactively guided by GPT-4o via conversational prompts, enabling intuitive
and user-friendly interaction. We validate CFDagent by reproducing canonical
sphere flows at Reynolds numbers of 100 and 300 using three distinct inputs: a
simple text prompt (i.e., "sphere"), an image-based input, and a standard
sphere model. The computed drag and lift coefficients from meshes produced by
each input approach closely match available data. The proposed system enables
synthesization of flow simulations and photorealistic visualizations for
complex geometries. Through extensive tests on canonical and realistic
scenarios, we demonstrate the robustness, versatility, and practical
applicability of CFDagent. By bridging generative AI with high-fidelity
simulations, CFDagent significantly lowers barriers to expert-level CFD,
unlocking broad opportunities in education, scientific research, and practical
engineering applications.

Conclusion: 该方案为CHNS系统提供了一种高效、稳定的数值解法，适用于复杂流体模拟。

Abstract: Incorporating the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) method and the zero energy
contribution (ZEC) technique, we analyze a linear and fully decoupled numerical
scheme for the Cahn-Hilliard-Naiver-Stokes (CHNS) system. More precisely, the
fully discrete scheme combines the marker-and-cell (MAC) finite difference
spatial approximation and BDF2 temporal discretization, as well as the
Adams-Bashforth extrapolation for the nonlinear terms, based on the SAV-ZEC
reformulation. A pressure correction approach is applied to decouple the Stokes
equation. Only constant-coefficient Poisson-like solvers are needed in the
implementation for the resulting numerical system. The numerical scheme is
unconditionally stable with respect to a rewritten total energy functional,
represented in terms of one auxiliary variable in the double-well potential,
another auxiliary variable to balance all the nonlinear and coupled terms, the
surface energy in the original phase variable, combined with the kinematic
energy part. Specifically, the error estimate for the phase variable in the
$\ell^{\infty}(0,T;H_h^1)\cap\ell^2(0,T;H_h^3)$ norm, the velocity variable in
the $\ell^{\infty}(0,T;\ell^2)\cap\ell^2(0,T;H_h^1)$ norm, is derived with
optimal convergence rates.

Abstract: This paper presents a high-order hybrid shifted Gegenbauer
integral-pseudospectral (HSG-IPS) method for solving the time-fractional
Benjamin-Bona-Mahony-Burgers (FBBMB) equation. A key innovation of our approach
is the transformation of the original equation into a fractional
partial-integro differential form that contains only a first-order derivative,
which can be accurately approximated using a first-order shifted Gegenbauer
differentiation matrix (SGDM), while all other terms in the transformed
equation are resolved using highly accurate quadrature rules. The method
combines several advanced numerical techniques including the shifted Gegenbauer
pseudospectral (SGPS) method, Gegenbauer-based fractional approximation (GBFA),
shifted Gegenbauer integration matrix (SGIM), shifted Gegenbauer integration
row vector (SGIRV), and SGDM to achieve spectral accuracy. Numerical
experiments demonstrate that the HSG-IPS method outperforms existing numerical
approaches, achieving significantly lower average absolute errors (AAEs) with
computational times as low as 0.04-0.05 seconds. The method's robustness is
validated across various fractional orders, showing excellent agreement with
analytical solutions. The transformation strategy effectively circumvents the
numerical instability associated with direct approximation of high-order
derivatives in the original equation, while the use of shifted Gegenbauer (SG)
polynomials and barycentric representations ensures numerical stability and
efficiency. This work provides a powerful computational framework for modeling
wave propagation, dispersion, and nonlinearity in fractional calculus
applications.

Abstract: An $hp$-adaptive continuous Galerkin finite element method is developed to
analyze a static anti-plane shear crack embedded in a nonlinear,
strain-limiting elastic body. The geometrically linear material is described by
a constitutive law relating stress and strain that is algebraically nonlinear.
In this investigation, the constitutive relation utilized is \textit{uniformly
bounded}, \textit{monotone}, \textit{coercive}, and \textit{Lipschitz
continuous}, ensuring the well-posedness of the mathematical model. The
governing equation, derived from the balance of linear momentum coupled with
the nonlinear constitutive relationship, is formulated as a second-order
quasi-linear elliptic partial differential equation. For a body with an edge
crack, this governing equation is augmented with a classical traction-free
boundary condition on the crack faces. An $hp$-adaptive finite element scheme
is proposed for the numerical approximation of the resulting boundary value
problem. The adaptive strategy is driven by a dual-component error estimation
scheme: mesh refinement ($h$-adaptivity) is guided by a residual-based a
posteriori error indicator of the \textit{Kelly type}, while the local
polynomial degree ($p$-adaptivity) is adjusted based on an estimator of the
local solution regularity. The performance, accuracy, and convergence
characteristics of the proposed method are demonstrated through numerical
experiments. The structure of the regularized crack-tip fields is examined for
various modeling parameters. Furthermore, the presented framework establishes a
robust foundation for extension to more complex and computationally demanding
problems, including quasi-static and dynamic crack propagation in brittle
materials.

introducing the additive inflation and a projection of the background
covariance to the observation space, we establish the error bound of the PO
method. A numerical example validates theoretical findings and shows the
potential to extend the analysis.

Conclusion: KRPs在矩阵和张量分解中具有潜力，改进的理论分析和算法提升了其实际应用价值。

Abstract: Randomization has emerged as a powerful set of tools for large-scale matrix
and tensor decompositions. Randomized algorithms involve computing sketches
with random matrices. A prevalent approach is to take the random matrix as a
standard Gaussian random matrix, for which the theory is well developed.
However, this approach has the drawback that the cost of generating and
multiplying by the random matrix can be prohibitively expensive. Khatri-Rao
random projections (KRPs), obtained by sketching with Khatri-Rao products of
random matrices, offer a viable alternative and are much cheaper to generate.
However, the theoretical guarantees of using KRPs are much more pessimistic
compared to their accuracy observed in practice. We attempt to close this gap
by obtaining improved analysis of the use of KRPs in matrix and tensor low-rank
decompositions. We propose and analyze a new algorithm for low-rank
approximations of block-structured matrices (e.g., block Hankel) using KRPs. We
also develop new algorithms to accelerate tensor computations in the Tucker
format using KRPs, and give theoretical guarantees of the resulting low-rank
approximations. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world tensors show
the computational benefits of the proposed methods.

Conclusion: 数值实验验证了方法的优越性，预处理器性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an efficient method for solving multi-dimensional
Riesz space fractional diffusion equations with variable coefficients. The
Crank-Nicolson (CN) method is used for temporal discretization, while the
fourth-order fractional centered difference (4FCD) method is employed for
spatial discretization. Using a novel technique, we show that the CN-4FCD
scheme for the multi-dimensional case is unconditionally stable and convergent,
achieving second-order accuracy in time and fourth-order accuracy in space with
respect to the discrete L2-norm. Moreover, leveraging the symmetric multi-level
Toeplitz-like structure of the coefficient matrix in the discrete linear
systems, we enhance the computational efficiency of the proposed scheme with a
sine transform-based preconditioner, ensuring a mesh-size-independent
convergence rate for the conjugate gradient method. Finally, two numerical
examples validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the superior
performance of the proposed preconditioner compared to existing methods.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于标准化卡尔曼滤波（SKF）的动态贝叶斯方法，用于解决EEG源定位中的深度偏差问题，并通过优化高斯先验模型提高了深层和浅层活动的检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG源定位在神经科学中至关重要，但存在深度偏差等问题，需要一种能够同时检测皮层和皮层下活动的方法。

Method: 采用标准化卡尔曼滤波（SKF）框架，结合高斯先验模型，并通过合成数据（类似P20/N20 SEP成分）优化先验参数配置，同时研究了RTS平滑对源分离的作用。

Result: 结果表明，将标准化指数提高到1.25并结合平滑处理，在低噪声水平下显著提高了深度定位的准确性。

Conclusion: SKF框架结合优化后的高斯先验模型和RTS平滑，能够有效提升EEG源定位的深度检测能力。

Abstract: EEG Source localization is a critical tool in neuroscience, with applications
ranging from epilepsy diagnosis to cognitive research. It involves solving an
ill-posed inverse problem that lacks a unique solution unless constrained by
prior knowledge. The Bayesian framework enables the incorporation of such
knowledge, typically encoded through prior models. Various algorithms have been
proposed for source localization, and they differ significantly in how prior
knowledge is incorporated. Some approaches rely on anatomical or functional
constraints, while others use statistical distributions or sampling-based
techniques. In this landscape, the Standardized Kalman Filter (SKF) represents
a dynamic Bayesian approach that integrates temporal modeling with a Gaussian
prior structure. It addresses the depth bias, a common limitation in source
localization, through a post-hoc standardization step that equalizes
sensitivity across cortical depths and makes deep activity detection feasible.
  This study focuses on the development and optimization of Gaussian prior
models within the SKF framework for simultaneous cortical and sub-cortical
activity detection. Synthetic data similar to the P20 / N20 component of the
somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) was used to identify effective prior
parameter configurations for reconstructing both deep and superficial sources
under different noise levels. We also investigated the role of RTS smoothing in
enhancing source separability. Our results indicate that raising the
standardization exponent to 1.25, along with smoothing, significantly improves
depth localization accuracy at low noise levels.

Conclusion: 复数框架为曲线设计提供了新的工具和简化方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: In this paper we develop the formalism of rational complex Bezier curves.
This framework is a simple extension of the CAD paradigm, since it describes
arc of curves in terms of control polygons and weights, which are extended to
complex values. One of the major advantages of this extension is that we may
make use of two different groups of projective transformations. Besides the
group of projective transformations of the real plane, we have the group of
complex projective transformations. This allows us to apply useful
transformations like the geometric inversion to curves in design. In addition
to this, the use of the complex formulation allows to lower the degree of the
curves in some cases. This can be checked using the resultant of two
polynomials and provides a simple formula for determining whether a rational
cubic curve is a conic or not. Examples of application of the formalism to
classical curves are included.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Schrödingerization框架的量子算法，用于解决Helmholtz方程等不定问题，通过提升维度和渐近色散校正实现高效计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Helmholtz方程在波数$k$增大时数值解变得困难，因其非强制性和高度振荡特性导致系统强不定性和大尺寸。

Method: 利用Schrödingerization框架将线性微分方程转化为Schrödinger型系统，通过提升维度和渐近色散校正抑制数值污染。

Result: 算法查询复杂度为$\mathcal{O}(\kappa^2\text{polylog}\varepsilon^{-1})$，Helmholtz方程通过预处理器降至$\mathcal{O}(\kappa\text{polylog}\varepsilon^{-1})$。

Conclusion: 该方法可推广至所有不定问题，为量子计算提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The Helmholtz equation is a prototypical model for time-harmonic wave
propagation. Numerical solutions become increasingly challenging as the wave
number $k$ grows, due to the equation's elliptic yet noncoercive character and
the highly oscillatory nature of its solutions, with wavelengths scaling as
$1/k$. These features lead to strong indefiniteness and large system sizes.
  We present a quantum algorithm for solving such indefinite problems, built
upon the Schr\"odingerization framework. This approach reformulates linear
differential equations into Schr\"odinger-type systems by capturing the steady
state of damped dynamics. A warped phase transformation lifts the original
problem to a higher-dimensional formulation, making it compatible with quantum
computation. To suppress numerical pollution, the algorithm incorporates
asymptotic dispersion correction. It achieves a query complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(\kappa^2\text{polylog}\varepsilon^{-1})$, where $\kappa$ is the
condition number and $\varepsilon$ the desired accuracy. For the Helmholtz
equation, a simple preconditioner further reduces the complexity to
$\mathcal{O}(\kappa\text{polylog}\varepsilon^{-1})$. Our constructive extension
to the quantum setting is broadly applicable to all indefinite problems.

Result: 预条件子高效且均匀，数值实验显示快速收敛和迭代次数稳定。

Conclusion: 提出的方法保证了Hodge Laplace问题的适定性，预条件子易于实现且高效。

Abstract: We use the practical framework for abstract perturbed saddle point problems
recently introduced by Hong et al. to analyze the mixed formulation of the
Hodge Laplace problem. We compose two parameter-dependent norms in which the
uniform continuity and stability of the problem follow. This not only
guarantees the well-posedness of the corresponding variational formulation on
the continuous level, but also of related compatible discrete models.
  We further simplify the obtained norms and, in both cases, arrive at the same
norm-equivalent preconditioner that is easily implementable. The efficiency and
uniformity of the preconditioner are demonstrated numerically by the fast
convergence and uniformly bounded number of preconditioned MINRES iterations
required to solve various instances of Hodge Laplace problems in two and three
space dimensions.

Abstract: Semi-discrete optimal transport (SOT), which maps a continuous probability
measure to a discrete one, is a fundamental problem with wide-ranging
applications. Entropic regularization is often employed to solve the SOT
problem, leading to a regularized (RSOT) formulation that can be solved
efficiently via its convex dual. However, a significant computational challenge
emerges when the continuous source measure is discretized via the finite
element (FE) method to handle complex geometries or densities, such as those
arising from solutions to Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). The evaluation
of the dual objective function requires dense interactions between the numerous
source quadrature points and all target points, creating a severe bottleneck
for large-scale problems. This paper presents a cohesive framework of numerical
strategies to overcome this challenge. We accelerate the dual objective and
gradient evaluations by combining distance-based truncation with fast spatial
queries using R-trees. For overall convergence, we integrate multilevel
techniques based on hierarchies of both the FE source mesh and the discrete
target measure, alongside a robust scheduling strategy for the regularization
parameter. When unified, these methods drastically reduce the computational
cost of RSOT, enabling its practical application to complex, large-scale
scenarios. We provide an open-source C++ implementation of this framework,
built upon the deal.II finite element library, available at
https://github.com/SemiDiscreteOT/SemiDiscreteOT.

Motivation: 解决传统方法在同时计算多个Helmholtz方程解时的效率问题。

Result: 算法在时间和空间上高效，支持高阶精度，数值结果验证了收敛性。

Conclusion: MFWH算法在计算多频Helmholtz方程解时表现出高效和准确性。

Abstract: We develop and analyze a new approach for simultaneously computing multiple
solutions to the Helmholtz equation for different frequencies and different
forcing functions. The new Multi-Frequency WaveHoltz (MFWH) algorithm is an
extension of the original WaveHoltz method and both are based on time-filtering
solutions to an associated wave equation. With MFWH, the different Helmholtz
solutions are computed simultaneously by solving a single wave equation
combined with multiple time filters. The MFWH algorithm defines a fixed-point
iteration which can be accelerated with Krylov methods such as GMRES. The
solution of the wave equation can be efficiently solved with either explicit
time-stepping or implicit time-stepping using as few as five time-steps per
period. When combined with an $O(N)$ solver for the implicit equations, such a
multigrid, the scheme has an $O(N)$ solution cost when the frequencies are
fixed and the number of grid points $N$ increases. High-order accurate
approximations in space are used together with second-order accurate
approximations in time. We show how to remove time discretization errors so
that the MFWH solutions converge to the corresponding solutions to the
discretized Helmholtz problems. Numerical results are given using second-order
accurate and fourth-accurate discretizations to confirm the convergence theory.

Result: 理论结果包括连续性模界和收敛速率，适用于多项式和指数级不适定问题。

Conclusion: DFD提供了一种有效的替代方法，扩展了源条件并改进了正则化技术。

Abstract: Let $X$ and $Y$ be Hilbert spaces, and $\mathbf{K}: \text{dom} \mathbf{K}
\subset X \to Y$ a bounded linear operator. This paper addresses the inverse
problem $\mathbf{K}x = y$, where exact data $y$ is replaced by noisy data
$y^\delta$ satisfying $\|y^\delta - y\|_Y \leq \delta$. Due to the
ill-posedness of such problems, we employ regularization methods to stabilize
solutions. While singular value decomposition (SVD) provides a classical
approach, its computation can be costly and impractical for certain operators.
We explore alternatives via Diagonal Frame Decomposition (DFD), generalizing
SVD-based techniques, and introduce a regularized solution $x^\delta_\alpha =
\sum_{\lambda \in \Lambda} \kappa_\lambda g_\alpha(\kappa_\lambda^2) \langle
y^\delta, v_\lambda \rangle \overline{u}_\lambda$. Convergence rates and
optimality are analyzed under a generalized source condition
$\mathbf{M}_{\varphi, E} = \{ x \in \text{dom} \mathbf{K} : \sum_{\lambda \in
\Lambda} [\varphi(\kappa_\lambda^2)]^{-1} |\langle x, u_\lambda \rangle|^2 \leq
E^2 \}$. Key questions include constructing DFD systems, relating DFD and SVD
singular values, and extending source conditions. We present theoretical
results, including modulus of continuity bounds and convergence rates for a
priori and a posteriori parameter choices, with applications to polynomial and
exponentially ill-posed problems.
