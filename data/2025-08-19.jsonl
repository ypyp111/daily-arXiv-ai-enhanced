The membrane interior is modeled as a\nnetwork of pores, allowing for the simultaneous adsorption of small particles\nand sieving of large particles, two fouling mechanisms typically observed\nduring the early stages of commercial filtration applications. In our model,\nfirst-principles continuum partial differential equations model transport of\nthe small particles and adsorptive fouling in each pore, while sieving\nparticles are assumed to follow a discrete Poisson arrival process with a\nbiased random walk through the pore network. Our goals are to understand the\nrelative influences of each fouling mode and highlight the effect of their\ncoupling on the performance of filters with a pore-size gradient (specifically,\nwe consider a banded filter with different pore sizes in each band). Our\nresults suggest that, due to the discrete nature of pore blockage, sieving\nalters qualitatively the rate of the flux decline.

What if we combine all FMs together? To our knowledge, this is\nthe first study to systematically evaluate both single and fused ophthalmic\nFMs. To address these questions, we propose FusionFM, a comprehensive\nevaluation suite, along with two fusion approaches to integrate different\nophthalmic FMs. Our framework covers both ophthalmic disease detection\n(glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration) and\nsystemic disease prediction (diabetes and hypertension) based on retinal\nimaging. We benchmarked four state-of-the-art FMs (RETFound, VisionFM,\nRetiZero, and DINORET) using standardized datasets from multiple countries and\nevaluated their performance using AUC and F1 metrics. Our results show that\nDINORET and RetiZero achieve superior performance in both ophthalmic and\nsystemic disease tasks, with RetiZero exhibiting stronger generalization on\nexternal datasets. Regarding fusion strategies, the Gating-based approach\nprovides modest improvements in predicting glaucoma, AMD, and hypertension.\nDespite these advances, predicting systemic diseases, especially hypertension\nin external cohort remains challenging.

These oscillations have applications\nin fuel-air mixing, heat exchangers, and landing gears, but resonance can\ndamage the structures that house the cavities. Consequently, understanding\ncavity oscillations under varying geometries and flow conditions is essential\nfor optimizing their benefits while minimizing the adverse effects. The present\nstudy investigates flow variations in a supersonic cavity confined by a top\nwall with a fixed deflection angle of $2.29^\\circ$. We examine two aspect\nratios of the cavity across freestream Mach numbers from 1.71 to 3 using\nLarge-Eddy Simulations (LES) in OpenFOAM. Numerical Schlieren reveals the key\nflow structures, while spectral analysis and reduced-order modeling help\nidentify dominant frequency modes and the corresponding flow structures. The\nresults show that the shock from the deflection corner induces high gradients\nin the flow properties as it impinges on the shear layer. This amplifies the\nKelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability, which enhances mixing and mitigates the\nexpected increase in oscillation frequency with Mach number. The KH instability\ndevelops spatially. Hence, the location of the shock impingement on the shear\nlayer and the distance that the disturbances in the shear layer convect before\nreaching the cavity wall significantly influence the prominence of the\ninstability, thereby influencing the frequency of cavity oscillations."}

The flow field is\nmodeled using large-eddy simulations (LES), and the time-averaged output serves\nas input to acoustic models that predict wind turbine noise. In the first\nturbine row, turbulence-induced noise (TIN) and trailing edge noise (TEN)\ncontribute equally, with TIN dominating at low frequencies and TEN at higher\nfrequencies. Downstream, TEN decreases due to lower wind speeds, while TIN\nmostly persists due to increased turbulence dissipation.

Despite its\nimportance, no large-scale benchmark exists for evaluating agents on future\nprediction, largely due to challenges in handling real-time updates and\nretrieving timely, accurate answers. To address this, we introduce\n$\\textbf{FutureX}$, a dynamic and live evaluation benchmark specifically\ndesigned for LLM agents performing future prediction tasks. FutureX is the\nlargest and most diverse live benchmark for future prediction, supporting\nreal-time daily updates and eliminating data contamination through an automated\npipeline for question gathering and answer collection. We evaluate 25 LLM/agent\nmodels, including those with reasoning, search capabilities, and integration of\nexternal tools such as the open-source Deep Research Agent and closed-source\nDeep Research models. This comprehensive evaluation assesses agents' adaptive\nreasoning and performance in dynamic environments. Additionally, we provide\nin-depth analyses of agents' failure modes and performance pitfalls in\nfuture-oriented tasks, including the vulnerability to fake web pages and the\ntemporal validity.

In\nparticular: a) Varying the ratio of high- to low-quality images between\nfinetuning and test sets leads to notable differences in downstream\nperformance; and b) The presence of sufficient high-quality images in the\nfinetuning set is critical for maintaining strong performance, whilst the\nimportance of matched finetuning and testing distribution varies between\ndifferent downstream tasks, such as automated radiology reporting and prostate\ncancer detection.When quality ratios are consistent, finetuning needs far less\nlabeled data than training from scratch, but label efficiency depends on image\nquality distribution. Without enough high-quality finetuning data, pretrained\nmodels may fail to outperform those trained without pretraining. This\nhighlights the importance of assessing and aligning quality distributions\nbetween finetuning and deployment, and the need for quality standards in\nfinetuning data for specific downstream tasks. Using ProFound, we show the\nvalue of quantifying image quality in both finetuning and deployment to fully\nrealise the data and compute efficiency benefits of foundation models."}

Thus, we\npropose DE-VAE, an uncertainty-aware variational AE using differential entropy\n(DE) to improve the learned parametric and invertible projections. Given a\nfixed projection, we train DE-VAE to learn a mapping into 2D space and an\ninverse mapping back to the original space. We conduct quantitative and\nqualitative evaluations on four well-known datasets, using UMAP and t-SNE as\nbaseline projection methods. Our findings show that DE-VAE can create\nparametric and inverse projections with comparable accuracy to other current\nAE-based approaches while enabling the analysis of embedding uncertainty."}

Using standardized\nzero-shot prompts, we compare a Western-centric model (GPT-4) and an\nEastern-centric model (ERNIE Bot). Human annotation shows significant and\nconsistent divergence across both dimensions. GPT-4 exhibits individualistic\nand low-power-distance tendencies (IDV score approx 1.21; PDI score approx\n-1.05), while ERNIE Bot shows collectivistic and higher-power-distance\ntendencies (IDV approx -0.89; PDI approx 0.76); differences are statistically\nsignificant (p < 0.001).

Using the Air Passengers dataset as a case study, we show that\na small set of lagged features -- particularly the twelve-month lag -- and\nseasonal encodings explain most forecast variance. We contribute: (i) a\nmethodology for applying LIME and SHAP to time series without violating\nchronology; (ii) theoretical exposition of the underlying algorithms; (iii)\nempirical evaluation with extensive analysis; and (iv) guidelines for\npractitioners."}

Existing defenses either\noverfit to fixed quantization settings or fail to address this cross-bit\ngeneralization vulnerability. We introduce \\textbf{TriQDef}, a tri-level\nquantization-aware defense framework designed to disrupt the transferability of\npatch-based adversarial attacks across QNNs. TriQDef consists of: (1) a Feature\nDisalignment Penalty (FDP) that enforces semantic inconsistency by penalizing\nperceptual similarity in intermediate representations; (2) a Gradient\nPerceptual Dissonance Penalty (GPDP) that explicitly misaligns input gradients\nacross bit-widths by minimizing structural and directional agreement via Edge\nIoU and HOG Cosine metrics; and (3) a Joint Quantization-Aware Training\nProtocol that unifies these penalties within a shared-weight training scheme\nacross multiple quantization levels.

Nevertheless,\nour preliminary experiments reveal that the generation quality of MDMs is still\nhighly sensitive to the choice of decoding strategy. In particular, widely\nadopted uncertainty-based samplers suffer from two key limitations: a lack of\nglobal trajectory control and a pronounced bias toward trivial tokens in the\nearly stages of decoding. These shortcomings restrict the full potential of\nMDMs. In this work, we introduce Position-Aware Confidence-Calibrated Sampling\n(PC-Sampler), a novel decoding strategy that unifies global trajectory planning\nwith content-aware informativeness maximization. PC-Sampler incorporates a\nposition-aware weighting mechanism to regulate the decoding path and a\ncalibrated confidence score to suppress the premature selection of trivial\ntokens. Extensive experiments on three advanced MDMs across seven challenging\nbenchmarks-including logical reasoning and planning tasks-demonstrate that\nPC-Sampler consistently outperforms existing MDM decoding strategies by more\nthan 10% on average, significantly narrowing the performance gap with\nstate-of-the-art autoregressive models.

To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a Superpixel-informed Continuous low-rank Tensor\nRepresentation (SCTR) framework, which enables continuous and flexible modeling\nof multi-dimensional data beyond traditional grid-based constraints. Our\napproach introduces two main innovations: First, motivated by the observation\nthat semantically coherent regions exhibit stronger low-rank characteristics\nthan holistic data, we employ superpixels as the basic modeling units. This\ndesign not only encodes rich semantic information, but also enhances\nadaptability to diverse forms of data streams. Second, we propose a novel\nasymmetric low-rank tensor factorization (ALTF) where superpixel-specific\nfactor matrices are parameterized by a shared neural network with specialized\nheads. By strategically separating global pattern learning from local\nadaptation, this framework efficiently captures both cross-superpixel\ncommonalities and within-superpixel variations. This yields a representation\nthat is both highly expressive and compact, balancing model efficiency with\nadaptability.

We study a range of content-based and account-based features derived from\nthe context, and compare this to the more widely studied approach of only\nlooking at the features from the reply tweet. For a more generalizable study,\nwe test four different classification models on a dataset made of\nconversational exchanges (parent-reply tweet pairs) with replies labeled as\nabusive or not. Our experiments show that incorporating contextual features\nleads to substantial improvements compared to the use of features derived from\nthe reply tweet only, confirming the importance of leveraging context. We\nobserve that, among the features under study, it is especially the\ncontent-based features (what is being posted) that contribute to the\nclassification performance rather than account-based features (who is posting\nit). While using content-based features, it is best to combine a range of\ndifferent features to ensure improved performance over being more selective and\nusing fewer features. Our study provides insights into the development of\ncontextualized abusive language detection models in realistic settings\ninvolving conversations."}

We demonstrate that benchmarks with a better\nsignal-to-noise ratio are more reliable when making decisions at small scale,\nand those with less noise have lower scaling law prediction error.

This paper investigates the use of Bidirectional Encoder\nRepresentations from Transformers (BERT) in combination with Hierarchical\nAttention Networks (HANs) for Multi-label classification, evaluating their\nperformance in comparison with conventional CNN and LSTM-based models.\nExperimental findings show that BERT achieves an overall accuracy of $0.972$,\nfar higher than conventional deep learning models in multi-label\nclassification. HAN outperforms baseline forms of CNN and LSTM-based models on\nspecific cybersecurity labels. However, BERT consistently achieves better\nprecision and recall, making it more suitable for predicting the consequences\nof a cyberattack."}

This characteristic renders\nadvanced semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) methods suboptimal, as\nthey are generally limited by a ``one-to-one'' relationship, where each image\nis independently associated with its GT. Such limitation may lead to error\naccumulation in low-contrast regions, further exacerbating confirmation bias.\nTo address this issue, we revisit the SSS pipeline from a group-oriented\nperspective and propose a human-inspired solution: the Intra-group Consistency\nAugmentation Framework (ICAF). First, we experimentally validate the inherent\nconsistency constraints within CdZnTe groups, establishing a group-oriented\nbaseline using the Intra-group View Sampling (IVS). Building on this insight,\nwe introduce the Pseudo-label Correction Network (PCN) to enhance consistency\nrepresentation, which consists of two key modules. The View Augmentation Module\n(VAM) improves boundary details by dynamically synthesizing a boundary-aware\nview through the aggregation of multiple views. In the View Correction Module\n(VCM), this synthesized view is paired with other views for information\ninteraction, effectively emphasizing salient regions while minimizing noise.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution for CdZnTe\nmaterials.

There has been a\nsubstantial body of research developing models for determining if a social\nmedia post is abusive or not; however, this research has primarily focused on\nexploiting social media posts individually, overlooking additional context that\ncan be derived from surrounding posts. In this study, we look at conversational\nexchanges, where a user replies to an earlier post by another user (the parent\ntweet). We ask: does leveraging context from the parent tweet help determine if\na reply post is abusive or not, and what are the features that contribute the\nmost? We study a range of content-based and account-based features derived from\nthe context, and compare this to the more widely studied approach of only\nlooking at the features from the reply tweet. For a more generalizable study,\nwe test four different classification models on a dataset made of\nconversational exchanges (parent-reply tweet pairs) with replies labeled as\nabusive or not. Our experiments show that incorporating contextual features\nleads to substantial improvements compared to the use of features derived from\nthe reply tweet only, confirming the importance of leveraging context. We\nobserve that, among the features under study, it is especially the\ncontent-based features (what is being posted) that contribute to the\nclassification performance rather than account-based features (who is posting\nit).

We demonstrate that benchmarks with a better\nsignal-to-noise ratio are more reliable when making decisions at small scale,\nand those with less noise have lower scaling law prediction error.

For further\nclarification, we define local posterior collapse to reflect the importance of\nindividual sample points in the data space and to relax the network constraint.\nThen, we propose Latent Reconstruction(LR) loss, which is inspired by\nmathematical properties of injective and composite functions, to control\nposterior collapse without restriction to a specific architecture. We\nexperimentally evaluate our approach, which controls posterior collapse on\nvaried datasets such as MNIST, fashionMNIST, Omniglot, CelebA, and FFHQ."}

A Reasoning Distillation Method via Multi-LoRA Interaction", "comment": "Accepted by IJCAI2025", "summary": "Recent studies have demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) have\nstrong mathematical reasoning abilities but rely on hundreds of billions of\nparameters. To tackle the challenge of poor reasoning in Small Language Models\n(SLMs), existing methods typically leverage LLMs to generate massive amounts of\ndata for cramming training. In psychology, they are akin to System 1 thinking,\nwhich resolves reasoning problems rapidly based on experience and intuition.\nHowever, human learning also requires System 2 thinking, where knowledge is\nfirst acquired and then reinforced through practice. Inspired by such two\ndistinct modes of thinking, we propose a novel method based on the multi-LoRA\nInteraction for mathematical reasoning Distillation (LoRID). First, we input\nthe question and reasoning of each sample into an LLM to create\nknowledge-enhanced datasets. Subsequently, we train a LoRA block on the student\nmodel as an Intuitive Reasoner (IR), which directly generates Chain-of-Thoughts\nfor problem-solving. Then, to imitate System 2 thinking, we train the Knowledge\nGenerator (KG) and Deep Reasoner (DR), respectively. The former outputs only\nknowledge after receiving problems, while the latter uses that knowledge to\nperform reasoning. Finally, to address the randomness in the generation of IR\nand DR, we evaluate whether their outputs are consistent, and the inference\nprocess needs to be iterated if not. This step can enhance the mathematical\nreasoning ability of SLMs through mutual feedback. Experimental results show\nthat LoRID achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially on the GSM8K\ndataset, where it outperforms the second-best method by 2.3%, 16.1%, 2.4%,\n12.3%, and 1.8% accuracy across the five base models, respectively."}

We study whether such\nreasoning can instead emerge from representations that capture both perceptual\nand temporal structure. We show that standard temporal contrastive learning,\ndespite its popularity, often fails to capture temporal structure due to its\nreliance on spurious features. To address this, we introduce Combinatorial\nRepresentations for Temporal Reasoning (CRTR), a method that uses a negative\nsampling scheme to provably remove these spurious features and facilitate\ntemporal reasoning. CRTR achieves strong results on domains with complex\ntemporal structure, such as Sokoban and Rubik's Cube. In particular, for the\nRubik's Cube, CRTR learns representations that generalize across all initial\nstates and allow it to solve the puzzle using fewer search steps than BestFS,\nthough with longer solutions. To our knowledge, this is the first method that\nefficiently solves arbitrary Cube states using only learned representations,\nwithout relying on an external search algorithm."}

This paradigm faces limitations when the\ndesired behavior is dependent on the example at hand. For example, a safe\nanswer may consist in abstaining from answering when asked for an illegal\nactivity, or may point to external resources or consultation with an expert\nwhen asked about medical advice.
