Despite this advancement,\ncurrent AI tutoring systems face limitations associated with their reactive\nnature, often providing direct answers without encouraging deep reflection or\nincorporating structured pedagogical tools and strategies. This limitation is\nmost apparent in the field of mathematics, in which AI tutoring systems remain\nunderdeveloped. This research addresses the question: How can AI tutoring\nsystems move beyond providing reactive assistance to enable structured,\nindividualized, and tool-assisted learning experiences? We introduce a novel\nmulti-agent AI tutoring platform that combines adaptive and personalized\nfeedback, structured course generation, and textbook knowledge retrieval to\nenable modular, tool-assisted learning processes. This system allows students\nto learn new topics while identifying and targeting their weaknesses, revise\nfor exams effectively, and practice on an unlimited number of personalized\nexercises.

The LMM designer\nreceives a gameplay goal and the current game configuration, analyses the play\ntraces, and edits the configuration to steer future behaviour toward the goal.\nWe demonstrate results that LMMs can reason over behavioral traces supplied by\nRL agents to iteratively refine game mechanics, pointing toward practical,\nscalable tools for AI-assisted game design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff08LMM\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6e38\u620f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7RL\u4ee3\u7406\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6e38\u620f\u884c\u4e3a\uff0cLMM\u6839\u636e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u8c03\u6574\u6e38\u620f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u96be\u4ee5\u4ece\u9759\u6001\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u4e2d\u6355\u6349\u52a8\u6001\u73a9\u5bb6\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7RL\u4ee3\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u6e38\u620f\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6570\u503c\u6307\u6807\u6216\u56fe\u50cf\u6458\u8981\uff0cLMM\u6839\u636e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u8c03\u6574\u6e38\u620f\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLMM\u80fd\u591f\u57fa\u4e8eRL\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u6e38\u620f\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aAI\u8f85\u52a9\u6e38\u620f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Control is\nimplemented using a model predictive control (MPC) framework, in which control\nsignals are computed by minimizing a cost function over the predicted evolution\nof the flow. The predictor is constructed entirely from data using Koopman\noperator theory, which enables a linear representation of the underlying\nnonlinear fluid dynamics. This linearity allows the MPC problem to be solved by\nalternating between two small and efficiently solvable convex quadratic\nprograms (QPs): one for the electrodes and one for the electromagnets.

We propose a\ncomputational implementation of this idea -- a ``Model Synthesis Architecture''\n(MSA) -- using language models to implement global relevance-based retrieval\nand model synthesis and probabilistic programs to implement bespoke, coherent\nworld models. We evaluate our MSA as a model of human judgments on a novel\nreasoning dataset. The dataset -- built around a `Model Olympics` domain of\nsports vignettes -- tests models' capacity for human-like, open-ended reasoning\nby requiring (i) judgments about novel causal structures described in language;\n(ii) drawing on large bodies of background knowledge; and (iii) doing both in\nlight of observations that introduce arbitrary novel variables. Our MSA\napproach captures human judgments better than language model-only baselines,\nunder both direct and chain-of-thought generations from the LM that supports\nmodel synthesis.

Language Model Representations Reflect Human Judgments of Event Plausibility", "comment": null, "summary": "Language models (LMs) are used for a diverse range of tasks, from question\nanswering to writing fantastical stories. In order to reliably accomplish these\ntasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,\nwhether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely\nnonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the\nability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,\n2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that\ndiscriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal\ndifference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have\naccess to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously\nreported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a\nconsistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,\nlayers, and parameter count).

To address these\nchallenges, our key idea is to embed a new visual parameter space into a\npre-trained LLM, enabling stable learning of visual knowledge from noisy data\nvia delta tuning. Based on this principle, we first introduce Mono-InternVL, an\nadvanced monolithic MLLM that incorporates a set of visual experts through a\nmultimodal mixture-of-experts architecture. In addition, we design an\ninnovative Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP) for Mono-InternVL to maximize\nits visual capabilities via progressive learning. Mono-InternVL achieves\ncompetitive performance against existing MLLMs but also leads to relatively\nexpensive data cost. Therefore, we further present Mono-InternVL-1.5, a cheaper\nand stronger monolithic MLLM equipped with an improved EViP (EViP++). EViP++\nintroduces additional visual attention experts to Mono-InternVL-1.5 and\nre-organizes the pre-training process in an efficient manner. During inference,\nit includes a fused CUDA kernel to speed up its MoE operations. With these\ndesigns, Mono-InternVL-1.5 significantly reduces training and inference costs,\nwhile still maintaining competitive performance with Mono-InternVL. To evaluate\nour approach, we conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks. Results\ndemonstrate that Mono-InternVL outperforms existing monolithic MLLMs on 12 out\nof 15 benchmarks, e.g., +114-point improvement over Emu3 on OCRBench. Compared\nto its modular counterpart, i.e., InternVL-1.5, Mono-InternVL-1.5 achieves\nsimilar multimodal performance while reducing first-token latency by up to 69%.\nCode and models are released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/Mono-InternVL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09Mono-InternVL\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Delta\u8c03\u4f18\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4e13\u5bb6\u67b6\u6784\u89e3\u51b3\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u4e3aMono-InternVL-1.5\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u6a21\u6001MLLM\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u548cDelta\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1Mono-InternVL\u53ca\u5176\u6539\u8fdb\u7248Mono-InternVL-1.5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528EViP++\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "Mono-InternVL\u572815\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0cMono-InternVL-1.5\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5355\u6a21\u6001MLLM\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

As a first step in this direction, we focus on the\none-dimensional viscous Burgers equation as a toy model. Its solutions\nexhibiting self-similar behavior, in a precisely-defined sense, are found by\nframing this problems in terms of PDE-constrained optimization. The main\nphysical parameters are the time window over which self-similar behavior is\nsought (equal to approximately one eddy turnover time), viscosity (inversely\nproportional to the ``Reynolds number\") and an integer parameter characterizing\nthe distance in the Fourier space over which self-similar interactions occur.\nLocal solutions to this nonconvex PDE optimization problems are obtained with a\nstate-of-the-art adjoint-based gradient method. Two distinct families of\nsolutions, termed viscous and inertial, are identified and are distinguished\nprimarily by the behavior of enstrophy which, respectively, uniformly decays\nand grows in the two cases.

This study presents the\nfirst comprehensive review of large-scale, pixel-wise crop mapping workflows,\nencompassing both conventional supervised methods and emerging transfer\nlearning approaches. To identify the optimal supervised crop mapping workflows,\nwe conducted systematic experiments, comparing six widely adopted satellite\nimage-based preprocessing methods, alongside eleven supervised pixel-wise\nclassification models. Additionally, we assessed the synergistic impact of\nvaried training sample sizes and variable combinations. Moreover, we identified\noptimal transfer learning techniques for different magnitudes of domain shift.\nThe evaluation of best methods was conducted across five diverse agricultural\nsites. Landsat 8 served as the primary satellite data source. Labels come from\nCDL trusted pixels and field surveys.\n  Our findings reveal three key insights. First, fine-scale interval\npreprocessing paired with Transformer models consistently delivered optimal\nperformance for both supervised and transferable workflows. RF offered rapid\ntraining and competitive performance in conventional supervised learning and\ndirect transfer to similar domains. Second, transfer learning techniques\nenhanced workflow adaptability, with UDA being effective for homogeneous crop\nclasses while fine-tuning remains robust across diverse scenarios. Finally,\nworkflow choice depends heavily on the availability of labeled samples. With a\nsufficient sample size, supervised training typically delivers more accurate\nand generalizable results. Below a certain threshold, transfer learning that\nmatches the level of domain shift is a viable alternative to achieve crop\nmapping.

The\nomputational results were validated by high-speed imaging experiments, with\nparticular focus on the types of rebound, asymmetric deformation, and\ndroplet-wall contact time. Results show that, the spinning motion of droplets\nleads to two novel rebound scenarios. Specificially, the front-raise tumbling\nrebound occurs at a lower $\\mathit{\\Omega}$ and is caused by the unsymmetrical\nLaplace pressure, while the rear-raise tumbling rebound emerges at a higher\n$\\mathit{\\Omega}$ and is attributed to the rotational inertia. The angular\nmomentum of the spinning droplet is dissipated or even reversed, while its\ndirection upon detachment is inconsistent with the visually observed spinning\nmotion. With the increase of the angular velocity, the droplet-wall contact\ntime is largely reduced, which is attributed to the asymmetric spreading by the\nspinning motion rather than the increased kinetic energy.

We argue that this\nprofound adaptability is fundamentally linked to the efficient construction and\nrefinement of internal representations of the environment, commonly referred to\nas world models, and we refer to this adaptation mechanism as world model\ninduction. However, current understanding and evaluation of world models in\nartificial intelligence (AI) remains narrow, often focusing on static\nrepresentations learned from training on a massive corpora of data, instead of\nthe efficiency and efficacy of models in learning these representations through\ninteraction and exploration within a novel environment. In this Perspective, we\nprovide a view of world model induction drawing on decades of research in\ncognitive science on how humans learn and adapt so efficiently; we then call\nfor a new evaluation framework for assessing adaptive world models in AI.\nConcretely, we propose a new benchmarking paradigm based on suites of carefully\ndesigned games with genuine, deep and continually refreshing novelty in the\nunderlying game structures -- we refer to this kind of games as novel games. We\ndetail key desiderata for constructing these games and propose appropriate\nmetrics to explicitly challenge and evaluate the agent's ability for rapid\nworld model induction.

Since there\ncould be an exponential number of object-action combinations, labeled data is\nlimited - leading to a long-tail distribution problem. Recently, zero-shot\nlearning emerged as a solution, with end-to-end transformer-based object\ndetectors adapted for HOID becoming successful frameworks. However, their\nprimary focus is designing improved decoders for learning entangled or\ndisentangled interpretations of interactions. We advocate that HOI-specific\ncues must be anticipated at the encoder stage itself to obtain a stronger scene\ninterpretation. Consequently, we build a top-down framework named Funnel-HOI\ninspired by the human tendency to grasp well-defined concepts first and then\nassociate them with abstract concepts during scene understanding.

However, these gains often persist\neven when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted\nrewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true\nreasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific\npatterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective\nand identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,\n\\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test\nproblems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \\emph{evaluation\nfragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are\nhighly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning\nconsistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic\nevaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting\nfixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve\nmultiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across\nstructurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and\nimproving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular\nbenchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and\nVAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for\nRL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models,\nwith average declines of 48.0\\% on AMC23 and 58.3\\% on AIME24.

This represents the first large scale, covariate\nadjusted and stratified correlation analysis conducted in a healthy population,\nwhich is essential for identifying early indicators of disease.

While knowledge is not cross-lingual consistency\nin many cases, code-switching training and cross-lingual word alignment\nobjectives show the most promising results, emphasizing the noteworthiness of\ncross-lingual alignment supervision and code-switching training for both\nmultilingual performance and cross-lingual consistency enhancement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5bf9\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u5bb6\u65cf\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u56e0\u7d20\u7b49\u5bf9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u63d0\u5347\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f20\u9012\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4ee3\u7801\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u5171\u6307\u9648\u8ff0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u53d7\u8bed\u8a00\u5bb6\u65cf\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u56e0\u7d20\u7b49\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u5207\u6362\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8bcd\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u5207\u6362\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

While this\npretraining-and-fine-tuning approach has been popular in other domains, such as\nVision and NLP, its application in industrial recommender systems presents\nnumerous challenges. The foundational model must be scalable enough to score\nmillions of items every second while meeting tight cost and latency constraints\nimposed by these systems. Additionally, it should capture the interactions\nbetween user activities and other features and handle new items that were not\npresent during the pretraining stage.\n  We developed innovative techniques to address these challenges. Our\ninfrastructure and algorithmic optimizations, such as the Deduplicated\nCross-Attention Transformer (DCAT), improved our throughput by 600% on\nPinterest internal data.

The most common is the use of automated\nbenchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different\ntopics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most\nconcerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is\nto have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a\nlarge and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and\ncostly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators\nand having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is\nthe use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can\nfreely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.\nThe results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important\naspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how\nenergy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of\ninterest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena\nthat incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the\nevaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented,\nshowing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy\nconsumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models. This suggests\nthat for most user interactions, the extra cost and energy incurred by the more\ncomplex and top-performing models do not provide an increase in the perceived\nquality of the responses that justifies their use.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGEA\uff08Generative Energy Arena\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u516c\u5f00\u7ade\u6280\u573a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7eb3\u5165\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u521d\u6b65\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u5728\u4e86\u89e3\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u540e\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u66f4\u5c0f\u3001\u66f4\u8282\u80fd\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff09\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u53c8\u5b58\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cLLM\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u7eb3\u5165\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGEA\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u7ade\u6280\u573a\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7528\u6237\u81ea\u7531\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u7eb3\u5165\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6392\u540d\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u5728\u4e86\u89e3\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u540e\uff0c\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u66f4\u8282\u80fd\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u989d\u5916\u6210\u672c\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5e76\u672a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "GEA\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

The Self is a multifaceted construct and it is\nreflected in language.

Many of the aspects of the Self align with psychological and\nother well-researched phenomena (e.g., those related to mental health),\nhighlighting the need for systematic NLP-based analysis.

These findings demonstrate that outcome-only metrics are\ninsufficient for evaluating multi-agent performance and highlight the\nimportance of process-level diagnostics in designing more interpretable and\nresource-efficient collaborative AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "GEMMAS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u534f\u4f5c\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ea7\u6307\u6807\uff08IDS\u548cUPR\uff09\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4f4e\u6548\u6c9f\u901a\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165GEMMAS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\u5efa\u6a21\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faIDS\u548cUPR\u4e24\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ea7\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728GSM8K\u7b49\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec5\u5dee2.1%\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728IDS\u548cUPR\u4e0a\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0812.8%\u548c80%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u679c\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ea7\u8bca\u65ad\u5bf9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u534f\u4f5cAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

However, the heavy\nreliance on task-specific human demonstrations limits their generalization and\nincurs high data acquisition costs. In this work, we present a new notion of\ntask-agnostic action paradigm that decouples action execution from\ntask-specific conditioning, enhancing scalability, efficiency, and\ncost-effectiveness. To address the data collection challenges posed by this\nparadigm -- such as low coverage density, behavioral redundancy, and safety\nrisks -- we introduce ATARA (Automated Task-Agnostic Random Actions), a\nscalable self-supervised framework that accelerates collection by over $\n30\\times $ compared to human teleoperation. To further enable effective\nlearning from task-agnostic data, which often suffers from distribution\nmismatch and irrelevant trajectories, we propose AnyPos, an inverse dynamics\nmodel equipped with Arm-Decoupled Estimation and a Direction-Aware Decoder\n(DAD). We additionally integrate a video-conditioned action validation module\nto verify the feasibility of learned policies across diverse manipulation\ntasks. Extensive experiments show that the AnyPos-ATARA pipeline yields a 51%\nimprovement in test accuracy and achieves 30-40% higher success rates in\ndownstream tasks such as lifting, pick-and-place, and clicking, using\nreplay-based video validation.

Fortunately,\nfoundation models, pre-trained on vast open-world datasets, demonstrate strong\npotential for this task due to their generalizable representation, which\npromotes the development of adaptive strategies on pre-trained models in\nlong-tailed learning. Advanced fine-tuning methods typically adjust visual\nencoders while neglecting the semantics derived from the frozen text encoder,\noverlooking the visual and textual alignment. To strengthen this alignment, we\npropose a novel approach, Semantic-guided fine-tuning of foundation model for\nlong-tailed visual recognition (Sage), which incorporates semantic guidance\nderived from textual modality into the visual fine-tuning process.\nSpecifically, we introduce an SG-Adapter that integrates class descriptions as\nsemantic guidance to guide the fine-tuning of the visual encoder.

This work lays a foundation for advancing SMOT in UAV scenarios with\napplications in bird strike avoidance, agriculture, fisheries, and ecological\nmonitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SMOT4SB\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u548c\u7ade\u8d5b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u96be\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff08SMOT\uff09\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u4ec5\u5360\u51e0\u5341\u50cf\u7d20\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u9700\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u6539\u8fdb\u5355\u5e27\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSMOT4SB\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08211\u4e2a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u89c6\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\uff09\u3001SO-HOTA\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff08\u7ed3\u5408Dot Distance\u548cHOTA\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3e\u529eMVA2025\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\u3002", "result": "\u7ade\u8d5b\u4e2d\u83b7\u80dc\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u53475.1\u500d\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9e1f\u51fb\u907f\u514d\u3001\u519c\u4e1a\u3001\u6e14\u4e1a\u548c\u751f\u6001\u76d1\u6d4b\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

Furthermore, we collect and open-source four high-quality, open-source\nworkload datasets derived from ByteDance's cloud services, encompassing\nworkload data from thousands of computing instances.

Although existing studies have predominantly\nfocused on data-driven approaches for arithmetic operations and symbolic\nmanipulation tasks, these approaches tend to be task-specific with limited\noverall performance. To pursue a more general solution, this paper focuses on a\nbroader case of reasoning problems that are computable, i.e., problems that\nalgorithms can solve, thus can be solved by the Turing Machine. From this\nperspective, this paper proposes Turing MAchine Imitation Learning (TAIL) to\nimprove the length generalization ability of LLMs. TAIL synthesizes\nchain-of-thoughts (CoT) data that imitate the execution process of a Turing\nMachine by computer programs, which linearly expands the reasoning steps into\natomic states to alleviate shortcut learning and explicit memory fetch\nmechanism to reduce the difficulties of dynamic and long-range data access in\nelementary operations. To validate the reliability and universality of TAIL, we\nconstruct a challenging synthetic dataset covering 8 classes of algorithms and\n18 tasks.

To address this challenge,\nwe propose an attention-refocusing scheme, called Simulate, Refocus and\nEnsemble (SRE), which learns to reduce the domain shift by aligning the\nattention maps in CLIP via attention refocusing. SRE first simulates domain\nshifts by performing augmentation on the source data to generate simulated\ntarget domains. SRE then learns to reduce the domain shifts by refocusing the\nattention in CLIP between the source and simulated target domains. Finally, SRE\nutilizes ensemble learning to enhance the ability to capture domain-invariant\nattention maps between the source data and the simulated target data.

At the same time, Generative AI -- particularly Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs) -- have achieved remarkable success across a wide\nrange of domains, such as healthcare, security, and Image Generation.

Recent post-training quantization (PTQ)\nmethods have attempted to mitigate this issue by focusing on the iterative\nnature of diffusion models.

In this paper, we propose a\nDMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise\nPower-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned\nEquivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute\nquantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall\nquantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having\nsmall quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error\naccumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to\nprioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that\nlayers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we\nintroduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations.

Furthermore, our combined model, utilizing optimal\narchitectural choices, consistently outperforms several existing models,\nreinforcing the validity of our conclusions.

However, we observe that most real-world\nscenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the\nperformance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models\nstill perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4\nresolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with\ndifferent resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression,\nnamely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides\nwhether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output\na special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing\nEfficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or\nthresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by\ncase. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding\ncapability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens\non simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge\nstrategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks.

However,\ninterrelationship among input modalities, uncertainties due to individual\nuni-modal data and potential clinical applications following such an\nuncertainty decomposition are yet fully understood in the context of\nlarge-scale MLLMs. In this work, we propose a multimodal uncertainty\npropagation model (MUPM) based on uncertainty propagation, to characterise the\nrelationship among the uncertainties arising from image-only, text-only, and\njoint image-text variations in MLLM inputs. Using real clinical data consisting\nof cardiac MR scans and digital health records, we describe that MUPMs can be\noptimised robustly with a few samples. We then show that the fitted MUPMs are\ngeneralisable across different input data distributions and, perhaps\nsurprisingly, across different downstream tasks. Such a transferability may be\nexplained by the shared pretraining, comparatively light MLLM fine-tuning,\nalong with the low-dimensional nature of the MUPMs. More importantly, this\nlearned transferability, quantifying the relationship between these\nuncertainties, led to direct clinical applications in which uncertainties may\nbe estimated and thus analysed robustly for varying data or even a novel set of\ncardiac disease prediction tasks. In addition, we show experimentally the\nefficiency in multimodal data required for estimating the overall uncertainty\nand its ability to identify redundant factors, both of which are considered\npractical yet clinically useful applications with the proposed MUPMs. Codes are\navailable at https://github.com/yucheng722/MUPM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u6a21\u578b\uff08MUPM\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u6587\u672c\u53ca\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8f93\u5165\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMUPM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u5206\u6790\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u6587\u672c\u53ca\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5fc3\u810fMR\u626b\u63cf\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "MUPM\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u75be\u75c5\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "MUPM\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u5fae\u8c03\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Prior methods relying on explicit geometric priors (e.g., facial\nlandmarks or 3DMM) often suffer from artifacts in cross reenactment and\nstruggle to capture subtle emotions. Furthermore, existing approaches lack\nsupport for multi-character animation, as driving features from different\nindividuals frequently interfere with one another, complicating the task. To\naddress these challenges, we propose FantasyPortrait, a diffusion transformer\nbased framework capable of generating high-fidelity and emotion-rich animations\nfor both single- and multi-character scenarios. Our method introduces an\nexpression-augmented learning strategy that utilizes implicit representations\nto capture identity-agnostic facial dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to\nrender fine-grained emotions. For multi-character control, we design a masked\ncross-attention mechanism that ensures independent yet coordinated expression\ngeneration, effectively preventing feature interference.

However, it is highly\nsusceptible to intrinsic signal errors and human-induced labeling errors, which\nlead to label noise and ultimately degrade model performance. To enhance EEG\nlearning, multimodal knowledge distillation (KD) has been explored to transfer\nknowledge from visual models with rich representations to EEG-based models.\nNevertheless, KD faces two key challenges: modality gap and soft label\nmisalignment. The former arises from the heterogeneous nature of EEG and visual\nfeature spaces, while the latter stems from label inconsistencies that create\ndiscrepancies between ground truth labels and distillation targets. This paper\naddresses semantic uncertainty caused by ambiguous features and weakly defined\nlabels. We propose a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that\nmitigates both modality and label inconsistencies.

A key difficulty in SR is estimating the unobservable feature, which\nencapsulates significant spectral information not captured by RGB imaging\nsensors. The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial\njoint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable\nfeature. Since HSIs share a similar spatial structure with the corresponding\nRGB images, it is rational to capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB\npre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning. To this\nend, we extend the RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an\nunobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for SR. As the RGB-LDM and its corresponding\nspatial autoencoder (SpaAE) already excel in spatial knowledge, the ULDM can\nfocus on modeling spectral structure. Moreover, separating the unobservable\nfeature from the HSI reduces the redundant spectral information and empowers\nthe ULDM to learn the joint distribution in a compact latent space.\nSpecifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline consisting of spectral structure\nrepresentation learning and spectral-spatial joint distribution learning to\ntransform the RGB-LDM into the ULDM. In the first stage, a spectral\nunobservable feature autoencoder (SpeUAE) is trained to extract and compress\nthe unobservable feature into a 3D manifold aligned with RGB space. In the\nsecond stage, the spectral and spatial structures are sequentially encoded by\nthe SpeUAE and the SpaAE, respectively.

To address the challenge of\nacquiring high-quality annotations, some recent weakly supervised methods\nutilize image-level labels to segment manipulated regions. However, the\nperformance is still limited due to insufficient supervision signals. In this\nstudy, we explore a form of weak supervision that improves the annotation\nefficiency and detection performance, namely scribble annotation supervision.\nWe re-annotated mainstream IML datasets with scribble labels and propose the\nfirst scribble-based IML (Sc-IML) dataset. Additionally, we propose the first\nscribble-based weakly supervised IML framework. Specifically, we employ\nself-supervised training with a structural consistency loss to encourage the\nmodel to produce consistent predictions under multi-scale and augmented inputs.\nIn addition, we propose a prior-aware feature modulation module (PFMM) that\nadaptively integrates prior information from both manipulated and authentic\nregions for dynamic feature adjustment, further enhancing feature\ndiscriminability and prediction consistency in complex scenes. We also propose\na gated adaptive fusion module (GAFM) that utilizes gating mechanisms to\nregulate information flow during feature fusion, guiding the model toward\nemphasizing potential tampered regions.

The current state-of-the-art BO approach for permutation\nspaces relies on the Mallows kernel-an $\\Omega(n^2)$ representation that\nexplicitly enumerates every pairwise comparison. Inspired by the close\nrelationship between the Mallows kernel and pairwise comparison, we propose a\nnovel framework for generating kernel functions on permutation space based on\nsorting algorithms. Within this framework, the Mallows kernel can be viewed as\na special instance derived from bubble sort. Further, we introduce the\n\\textbf{Merge Kernel} constructed from merge sort, which replaces the quadratic\ncomplexity with $\\Theta(n\\log n)$ to achieve the lowest possible complexity.\nThe resulting feature vector is significantly shorter, can be computed in\nlinearithmic time, yet still efficiently captures meaningful permutation\ndistances. To boost robustness and right-invariance without sacrificing\ncompactness, we further incorporate three lightweight, task-agnostic\ndescriptors: (1) a shift histogram, which aggregates absolute element\ndisplacements and supplies a global misplacement signal; (2) a split-pair line,\nwhich encodes selected long-range comparisons by aligning elements across the\ntwo halves of the whole permutation; and (3) sliding-window motifs, which\nsummarize local order patterns that influence near-neighbor objectives.

The absence of ground truths for\nunknown objects makes OWOD tasks particularly challenging. Many methods have\naddressed this by using pseudo-labels for unknown objects. The recently\nproposed Probabilistic Objectness transformer-based open-world detector (PROB)\nis a state-of-the-art model that does not require pseudo-labels for unknown\nobjects, as it predicts probabilistic objectness. However, this method faces\nissues with learning conflicts between objectness and class predictions.\n  To address this issue and further enhance performance, we propose a novel\nmodel, Decoupled PROB.

Traditional\nflow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions\n(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like\ncross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating\ntime and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent\nimages as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action\nwhile eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative\nmodeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different\nmodalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data\nlacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional\nvisual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a\nstructured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,\nup-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we\nsupervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs\nthrough flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss\nthrough sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end\nlearning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging\nbi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and\n2 real-world tasks. Despite its simplicity, MLP-only VITA outperforms or\nmatches state-of-the-art generative policies while reducing inference latency\nby 50-130% compared to conventional flow matching policies requiring different\nconditioning mechanisms or complex architectures.

In this paper, we propose Redundancy-Removal Mixture of\nExperts (R^2MoE), a parameter-efficient framework for lifelong visual concept\nlearning that effectively learns new concepts while incurring minimal parameter\noverhead. Our framework includes three key innovative contributions: First, we\npropose a mixture-of-experts framework with a routing distillation mechanism\nthat enables experts to acquire concept-specific knowledge while preserving the\ngating network's routing capability, thereby effectively mitigating\ncatastrophic forgetting. Second, we propose a strategy for eliminating\nredundant layer-wise experts that reduces the number of expert parameters by\nfully utilizing previously learned experts. Third, we employ a hierarchical\nlocal attention-guided inference approach to mitigate interference between\ngenerated visual concepts.

As AI-generated visual content\nbecomes increasingly indistinguishable from real content, the challenge of\ndetecting the generated content becomes critical in combating misinformation,\nensuring privacy, and preventing security threats. Although there has been\nsubstantial progress in detecting AI-generated images, current methods for\nvideo detection are largely focused on deepfakes, which primarily involve human\nfaces.

To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that\nleverages pre-trained visual models to distinguish between real and generated\nvideos. The features extracted from these pre-trained models, which have been\ntrained on extensive real visual content, contain inherent signals that can\nhelp distinguish real from generated videos.

To generate data via a flow matching model, an\nordinary differential equation (ODE) is numerically solved via forward\nintegration of the modeled velocity field. To better capture the multi-modality\nthat is inherent in typical velocity fields, hierarchical flow matching was\nrecently introduced. It uses a hierarchy of ODEs that are numerically\nintegrated when generating data. This hierarchy of ODEs captures the\nmulti-modal velocity distribution just like vanilla flow matching is capable of\nmodeling a multi-modal data distribution. While this hierarchy enables to model\nmulti-modal velocity distributions, the complexity of the modeled distribution\nremains identical across levels of the hierarchy. In this paper, we study how\nto gradually adjust the complexity of the distributions across different levels\nof the hierarchy via mini-batch couplings. We show the benefits of mini-batch\ncouplings in hierarchical rectified flow matching via compelling results on\nsynthetic and imaging data.
