In this work, we study the concept of the minimal seed for\nrelaminarization - the smallest perturbation of a turbulent state that triggers\na direct transition to laminar flow without a chaotic transient. We formulate\nthe identification of this optimal perturbation as a fully nonlinear\noptimization problem and develop a numerical framework based on a multi-step\npenalty method to compute it. Applying this framework to the nine-mode\nMoehlis-Faisst-Eckhardt model of a sinusoidal shear flow, we compute the\nminimal seeds for both transition to turbulence and relaminarization. While\nboth of these minimal seeds lie infinitesimally close to the laminar-turbulent\nboundary -- the so-called edge of chaos -- they are generally unrelated and lie\nin qualitatively distinct regions of state space, thereby providing different\ninsights into the flow's underlying structure. We find that while the optimal\nperturbation for triggering transition is primarily in the direction of the\nmode representing streamwise vortices, or rolls, the optimal perturbation for\nrelaminarization is distributed across multiple modes, without strong\ncontributions in the roll or streak directions. While counterintuitive, this\nfinding indicates that fully nonlinear control schemes exploiting the structure\nof the turbulent attractor might offer great improvements over classical\nmethods based on linearizations and those which simply counteract the dominant\nfeatures of the turbulent flow.

We focus on binary mixtures, such as water and\n1,2-hexanediol, where only one component evaporates and evaporation is slow,\nthereby allowing simplifications to the governing equations. To manage the\ncomplexity of the full three-dimensional droplet problem, we begin with a\ntwo-dimensional model of neighbouring rivulets.

Six OpenAI models across three architectures (o-series, GPT-4-class,\nand GPT-3.5) were tested under two paradigms: direct-to-coordinate and\ntool-augmented chain-of-thought invoking external geocoding APIs. Results were\ncompared with a GIS-analyst baseline, the Stanford NER geoparser, Mordecai-3,\nand a county-centroid heuristic.\n  The top single-call model, o3-2025-04-16, achieved a mean error of 23 km\n(median 14 km), outperforming the median LLM (37.4 km) by 37.5%, the weakest\nLLM (50.3 km) by 53.5%, and external baselines by 67% (GIS analyst) and 70%\n(Stanford NER). A five-call ensemble further reduced errors to 19 km (median 12\nkm) at minimal additional cost (approx. USD 0.20 per grant), outperforming the\nmedian LLM by 48.6%. A patentee-name-redaction ablation increased error by\nabout 9%, indicating reliance on textual landmark and adjacency descriptions\nrather than memorization. The cost-efficient gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model maintained\na 28 km mean error at USD 1.09 per 1,000 grants, establishing a strong\ncost-accuracy benchmark; external geocoding tools offered no measurable benefit\nin this evaluation.\n  These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs for scalable, accurate, and\ncost-effective historical georeferencing."}

The primary contribution is a\ntwo-stage system that leverages the differential response of ATR to various\ndistortions. First, the system utilizes the signature from two specialist ATR\nconfigurations to classify the primary artifact type (blur vs. noise) with over\n97% accuracy. Second, following classification, it employs a dedicated\nregression model mapping the relevant ATR score to a quality rating to quantify\nthe degradation. On a combined dataset, the complete system predicts human\nscores with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.892 and a Root Mean Square\nError (RMSE) of 5.17 DMOS points. This error corresponds to just 7.4% of the\ndataset's total quality range, demonstrating high predictive accuracy.

By re-examining the outputs of autoregressive models, we observed\nthat some segments exhibit parallelizable structures, which we term intrinsic\nparallelism. Decoding each parallelizable branch simultaneously (i.e. parallel\ndecoding) can significantly improve the overall inference speed of LLMs. In\nthis paper, we propose an Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding (ASPD), which\naddresses two core challenges: automated construction of parallelizable data\nand efficient parallel decoding mechanism. More specifically, we introduce a\nnon-invasive pipeline that automatically extracts and validates parallelizable\nstructures from the responses of autoregressive models. To empower efficient\nadaptive serial-parallel decoding, we implement a Hybrid Decoding Engine which\nenables seamless transitions between serial and parallel decoding modes while\nmaintaining a reusable KV cache, maximizing computational efficiency. Extensive\nevaluations across General Tasks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Mathematical\nReasoning, demonstrate that ASPD achieves unprecedented performance in both\neffectiveness and efficiency.

Camera-ready version", "summary": "This paper describes our participation in SemEval 2025 Task 8, focused on\nTabular Question Answering. We developed a zero-shot pipeline that leverages an\nLarge Language Model to generate functional code capable of extracting the\nrelevant information from tabular data based on an input question. Our approach\nconsists of a modular pipeline where the main code generator module is\nsupported by additional components that identify the most relevant columns and\nanalyze their data types to improve extraction accuracy. In the event that the\ngenerated code fails, an iterative refinement process is triggered,\nincorporating the error feedback into a new generation prompt to enhance\nrobustness. Our results show that zero-shot code generation is a valid approach\nfor Tabular QA, achieving rank 33 of 53 in the test phase despite the lack of\ntask-specific fine-tuning."}

This makes the labeling process both time-consuming and less\nreliable. Specifically, there is a growing demand for approaches that can\neffectively utilize large-scale unlabeled data from online social networks.\nUnlike typical unsupervised learning tasks, where categories are distinct,\nAI-generated faces closely mimic real image distributions and share strong\nsimilarities, causing performance drop in conventional strategies. In this\npaper, we introduce the Dual-Path Guidance Network (DPGNet), to tackle two key\nchallenges: (1) bridging the domain gap between faces from different generation\nmodels, and (2) utilizing unlabeled image samples. The method features two core\nmodules: text-guided cross-domain alignment, which uses learnable prompts to\nunify visual and textual embeddings into a domain-invariant feature space, and\ncurriculum-driven pseudo label generation, which dynamically exploit more\ninformative unlabeled samples. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we also\nfacilitate bridging between domains via cross-domain knowledge distillation.\nExtensive experiments on \\textbf{11 popular datasets}, show that DPGNet\noutperforms SoTA approaches by \\textbf{6.3\\%}, highlighting its effectiveness\nin leveraging unlabeled data to address the annotation challenges posed by the\nincreasing realism of deepfakes."}

Although recent research\nhas focused on enhancing spatial and temporal understanding independently, this\npaper presents a novel approach that integrates both aspects through visual\nprompting. We introduce a method that projects visual traces of key points from\nobservations onto depth maps, enabling models to capture both spatial and\ntemporal information simultaneously. The experiments in SimplerEnv show that\nthe mean number of tasks successfully solved increased for 4% compared to\nSpatialVLA and 19% compared to TraceVLA. Furthermore, we show that this\nenhancement can be achieved with minimal training data, making it particularly\nvaluable for real-world applications where data collection is challenging.

We introduce ASPIRE, Arbitrary Set-based Permutation-Invariant\nReasoning Engine, a Universal Neural Inference model for semantic reasoning and\nprediction over heterogeneous structured data. ASPIRE combines a\npermutation-invariant, set-based Transformer with a semantic grounding module\nthat incorporates natural language descriptions, dataset metadata, and\nin-context examples to learn cross-dataset feature dependencies. This\narchitecture allows ASPIRE to ingest arbitrary sets of feature--value pairs and\nsupport examples, align semantics across disjoint tables, and make predictions\nfor any specified target. Once trained, ASPIRE generalizes to new inference\ntasks without additional tuning. In addition to delivering strong results\nacross diverse benchmarks, ASPIRE naturally supports cost-aware active feature\nacquisition in an open-world setting, selecting informative features under\ntest-time budget constraints for an arbitrary unseen dataset. These\ncapabilities position ASPIRE as a step toward truly universal, semantics-aware\ninference over structured data."}

Our work here reveals a critical\nphenomenon, temporal oscillation, where correct answers often emerge in the\nmiddle process, but are overwritten in later denoising steps. To address this\nissue, we introduce two complementary methods that exploit temporal\nconsistency: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting, a training-free, test-time\ndecoding strategy that aggregates predictions across denoising steps to select\nthe most consistent output; and 2) a post-training method termed Temporal\nConsistency Reinforcement, which uses Temporal Semantic Entropy (TSE), a\nmeasure of semantic stability across intermediate predictions, as a reward\nsignal to encourage stable generations. Empirical results across multiple\nbenchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using the negative\nTSE reward alone, we observe a remarkable average improvement of 24.7% on the\nCountdown dataset over an existing dLLM. Combined with the accuracy reward, we\nachieve absolute gains of 2.0% on GSM8K, 4.3% on MATH500, 6.6% on SVAMP, and\n25.3% on Countdown, respectively. Our findings underscore the untapped\npotential of temporal dynamics in dLLMs and offer two simple yet effective\ntools to harness them."}
