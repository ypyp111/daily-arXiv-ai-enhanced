The comparison is made meaningful by generating rough walls\nfrom instantaneous configurations of the elastic cases. The aim of this\ncomparison is to individually understand the role of fluid-structure\ninteraction effects and the role of wall shape/undulations in determining the\noverall physics of flow near elastic walls. With an increase in the compliance\nof the wall, qualitatively similar trends for many of the effects produced by a\nrough wall are also seen in the elastic wall. However, specific features can be\nobserved for the elastic wall cases only, arising from the mutual interaction\nbetween the solid and fluid, leading to a further increase in drag. To\nunderstand them, we look at the turbulent structures, which exhibit clear\ndifferences across the various configurations: roughness induces only a slight\nreduction of streamwise coherency, resulting in a situation qualitatively\nsimilar to what is found in classical turbulent channel flows, whereas\nelasticity causes the emergence of a novel dominant spanwise coherency.\nAdditionally, we explored the effect of vertical disturbances on elastic wall\ndynamics by comparing with permeable walls having similar (average) wall-normal\nvelocity fluctuations at the interface. The permeable walls were found to have\nminimal similarities with elastic walls. Overall, we can state that the wall\nmotion caused by the complex fluid-structure interaction contributes\nsignificantly to the flow and must be considered when modeling it.

High-fidelity\nthermal data were then generated through LBM simulations across various\nReynolds (Re) and Strouhal numbers (St). Among several machine learning models\nevaluated via nested cross-validation and Bayesian optimization, XGBoost\nachieved the best predictive performance for the average Nusselt number (Nu)\n(R^2=0.9981). Model interpretation using SHAP identified the Reynolds number,\nStrouhal number, porosity, specific surface area, and pore size dispersion as\nthe most influential predictors, while also revealing synergistic interactions\namong them. Threshold-based insights, including Re > 75 and porosity > 0.6256,\nprovide practical guidance for enhancing convective heat transfer. This\nintegrated approach delivers both quantitative predictive accuracy and physical\ninterpretability, offering actionable guidelines for designing porous media\nwith improved thermal performance under oscillatory flow conditions."}

We examined the responses of both Newtonian and\nviscoelastic drops. For viscoelastic samples, image analysis techniques were\nemployed to correlate the drop dynamics with the rheological properties of the\nmaterial. Overall, we demonstrate that this drop-based method allows for\noscillatory shear experiments at frequencies that are difficult to access using\nconventional rheometers. The results reveal that the essential features of the\ndrop response can be explained by the ratio of two characteristic time scales:\nthe internal polymer relaxation time ($t_{p}$) and the external forcing time\nscale ($1/f$). This ratio defines the Deborah number ($De$). When the two time\nscales are comparable ($De \\approx 1$), viscous dissipation dominates, which is\nobserved in Lissajous curves and the drop's profile. At very low Deborah\nnumbers ($De \\ll 1$), the drop behaves like a Newtonian fluid (having a peak\naround natural frequency of the drop), while at high Deborah numbers ($De \\gg\n1$), it exhibits an elastic response. Furthermore, we show that increasing the\napplied deformation drives the system into the nonlinear viscoelastic regime.\nIn this regime, unlike traditional rheology measurements, we observe the\npresence of $even$ and $odd$ harmonics in the drop response.

Unlike conventional part\nsegmentation methods that rely on appearance-based semantic cues, SP4D learns\nto produce kinematic parts - structural components aligned with object\narticulation and consistent across views and time. SP4D adopts a dual-branch\ndiffusion model that jointly synthesizes RGB frames and corresponding part\nsegmentation maps. To simplify the architecture and flexibly enable different\npart counts, we introduce a spatial color encoding scheme that maps part masks\nto continuous RGB-like images. This encoding allows the segmentation branch to\nshare the latent VAE from the RGB branch, while enabling part segmentation to\nbe recovered via straightforward post-processing. A Bidirectional Diffusion\nFusion (BiDiFuse) module enhances cross-branch consistency, supported by a\ncontrastive part consistency loss to promote spatial and temporal alignment of\npart predictions. We demonstrate that the generated 2D part maps can be lifted\nto 3D to derive skeletal structures and harmonic skinning weights with few\nmanual adjustments.

This modification\nimproves the accuracy of UQ-VAEs, as the original theoretical result relies on\nthe convergence of the sample mean to the expected value (a condition that, in\nhigh dimensional parameter spaces, requires a prohibitively large number of\nsamples due to the curse of dimensionality). Avoiding the computation of the\nsample mean significantly reduces the training time in high dimensional\nparameter spaces compared to previous literature results. Under this new\nformulation, we establish a new theoretical result for the approximation of the\nposterior mean and covariance for general mathematical problems. We validate\nthe effectiveness of UQ-VAEs through three benchmark numerical tests: a Poisson\ninverse problem, a non affine inverse problem and a 0D cardiocirculatory model,\nunder the two clinical scenarios of systemic hypertension and ventricular\nseptal defect. For the latter case, we perform forward uncertainty\nquantification."}

A dynamic regularization strategy is introduced, incorporating\nnormalized gradient constraints from RGB/panchromatic-derived reference images,\nwhich constructs a TV subgradient similarity function with strict convex\noptimization guarantees. Leveraging spatial priors from auxiliary cameras, an\nadaptive reference generation and updating mechanism is designed to provide\nsubgradient guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method\neffectively preserves spatial-spectral structural consistency. The theoretical\nframework establishes an interpretable mathematical foundation for\ncomputational spectral imaging, demonstrating robust performance across diverse\nreconstruction scenarios.

Although this scheme is simple to implement, it\ntends to overly focus on local information, potentially leading to the neglect\nor omission of crucial global information. To mitigate this issue, we propose\nJudge Q, a novel training method which incorporates a soft token list. This\nmethod only tunes the model's embedding layer at a low training cost. By\nconcatenating the soft token list at the end of the input sequence, we train\nthese tokens' attention map to the original input sequence to align with that\nof the actual decoded tokens.

Each CC is\nmodeled by a dedicated NN, enabling a modular and interpretable representation\nof the system equation. To demonstrate the versatility of the CC-based\nformalism, we introduce three identification strategies: (1) SINDy-CC, which\nextends the sparse regression approach of SINDy by incorporating the\nmathematical structure of the governing equations as constraints; (2) Poly-CC,\nwhich represents each CC using high-degree polynomials; and (3) NN-CC, which\nuses NNs without requiring prior assumptions about basis functions.

Text2Mem defines a compact yet\nexpressive operation set aligned with encoding, storage, and retrieval. Each\ninstruction is represented as a JSON based schema instance with required fields\nand semantic invariants, which a parser transforms into typed operation objects\nwith normalized parameters. A validator ensures correctness before execution,\nwhile adapters map typed objects either to a SQL prototype backend or to real\nmemory frameworks. Model based services such as embeddings or summarization are\nintegrated when required. All results are returned through a unified execution\ncontract. This design ensures safety, determinism, and portability across\nheterogeneous backends.

This paper conducts an investigation of the impact\n(on performance and bias) on AI classification models of granularity in the FST\nscale. By training multiple AI models to classify benign vs. malignant lesions\nusing FST-specific data of differing granularity, we show that: (i) when\ntraining models using FST-specific data based on three groups (FST 1/2, 3/4 and\n5/6), performance is generally better for models trained on FST-specific data\ncompared to a general model trained on FST-balanced data; (ii) reducing the\ngranularity of FST scale information (from 1/2 and 3/4 to 1/2/3/4) can have a\ndetrimental effect on performance.

Thus, there is a growing\nneed for a general-purpose method to detect hallucinations in LLMs. In this\nwork, we introduce HalluField, a novel field-theoretic approach for\nhallucination detection based on a parametrized variational principle and\nthermodynamics. Inspired by thermodynamics, HalluField models an LLM's response\nto a given query and temperature setting as a collection of discrete likelihood\ntoken paths, each associated with a corresponding energy and entropy. By\nanalyzing how energy and entropy distributions vary across token paths under\nchanges in temperature and likelihood, HalluField quantifies the semantic\nstability of a response. Hallucinations are then detected by identifying\nunstable or erratic behavior in this energy landscape. HalluField is\ncomputationally efficient and highly practical: it operates directly on the\nmodel's output logits without requiring fine-tuning or auxiliary neural\nnetworks. Notably, the method is grounded in a principled physical\ninterpretation, drawing analogies to the first law of thermodynamics.\nRemarkably, by modeling LLM behavior through this physical lens, HalluField\nachieves state-of-the-art hallucination detection performance across models and\ndatasets."}

This is an\nexpensive endeavor and is often infeasible, as model developers tend not to\nrelease their pre-training data. Naive approaches, such as continued\npretraining, suffer from catastrophic forgetting; however, mitigation\nstrategies like experience replay cannot be applied due to the lack of original\npretraining data. In this work, we investigate the problem of continually\nadding new languages to a multilingual model, assuming access to pretraining\ndata in only the target languages. We explore multiple approaches to address\nthis problem and propose Layer-Selective LoRA (LayRA), which adds Low-Rank\nAdapters (LoRA) to selected initial and final layers while keeping the rest of\nthe model frozen. LayRA builds on two insights: (1) LoRA reduces forgetting,\nand (2) multilingual models encode inputs in the source language in the initial\nlayers, reason in English in intermediate layers, and translate back to the\nsource language in final layers. We experiment with adding multiple\ncombinations of Galician, Swahili, and Urdu to pretrained language models and\nevaluate each method on diverse multilingual tasks.

The key to solving this problem lies in\navoiding catastrophic forgetting of knowledge about previous target classes\nduring continuously mitigating the domain shift. Most previous works\ncumbersomely combine two technical components. On one hand, they need to store\nand utilize rehearsal target sample from previous time steps to avoid\ncatastrophic forgetting; on the other hand, they perform alignment only between\nclasses shared across domains at each time step. Consequently, the memory will\ncontinuously increase and the asymmetric alignment may inevitably result in\nknowledge forgetting. In this paper, we propose to mine and preserve\ndomain-invariant and class-agnostic knowledge to facilitate the CI-UDA task.\nSpecifically, via using CLIP, we extract the class-agnostic properties which we\nname as \"attribute\". In our framework, we learn a \"key-value\" pair to represent\nan attribute, where the key corresponds to the visual prototype and the value\nis the textual prompt. We maintain two attribute dictionaries, each\ncorresponding to a different domain.

Existing hallucination mitigation methods are mainly based on\npreference alignment and require external human annotations or auxiliary models\nfor preference data collection, which increase costs and limit sustainable\nimprovement. To tackle these challenges, we propose Autonomous Preference\nAlignment via Self-Injection (APASI), a novel and generalizable method that\nmitigates hallucinations without external dependencies. APASI leverages the\ntarget LVLM to self-inject hallucinations into a generated response, creating a\npair of responses with varying preference levels. During the self-injection\nprocess, the dis-preferred response is generated based on three key\nobservations of hallucinations, ensuring it simulates real hallucination\npatterns. This fidelity offers an accurate learning signal for hallucination\nmitigation. Moreover, APASI incorporates an iterative alignment training\nstrategy combined with curriculum learning to periodically update the\npreference data with increasing challenge, enabling stable and continuous\nenhancement of the LVLM. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks show that\nAPASI not only effectively mitigates hallucinations for three baseline models\nbut also achieves comparable or even superior performance to alignment-based\nmethods with external dependency, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness and\ngeneralization capability.

These definitions are stated unambiguously through\nexecutable recursive programs, satisfying all criteria we propose for a formal\nspecification. In this sense, they resemble the \"standard form\" used in the\nstudy of general-purpose solvers.\n  Grounded in algebraic programming theory-a relational formalism for deriving\ncorrect-by-construction algorithms from specifications-we can not only\nestablish the existence or nonexistence of dynamic programming solutions but\nalso derive them constructively whenever they exist. Consequently, the four\ngeneric problem definitions yield four novel optimal algorithms for ODT\nproblems with arbitrary splitting rules that satisfy the axioms and objective\nfunctions of a given form. These algorithms encompass the known\ndepth-constrained, axis-parallel ODT algorithm as the special case, while\nproviding a unified, efficient, and elegant solution for the general ODT\nproblem.\n  In Part II, we present the first optimal hypersurface decision tree algorithm\nand provide comprehensive experiments against axis-parallel decision tree\nalgorithms, including heuristic CART and state-of-the-art optimal methods. The\nresults demonstrate the significant potential of decision trees with flexible\nsplitting rules. Moreover, our framework is readily extendable to support\nalgorithms for constructing even more flexible decision trees, including those\nwith mixed splitting rules."}

These challenges\nare even more pronounced in resource-limited settings. Many existing Class\nIncremental Learning (CIL) methods achieve high accuracy by continually\nadapting their feature representations; however, they often require substantial\ncomputational resources and complex, iterative training procedures. This work\nintroduces CIFNet (Class Incremental and Frugal Network), a novel CIL approach\nthat addresses these limitations by offering a highly efficient and sustainable\nsolution. CIFNet's key innovation lies in its novel integration of several\nexisting, yet separately explored, components: a pre-trained and frozen feature\nextractor, a compressed data buffer, and an efficient non-iterative one-layer\nneural network for classification. A pre-trained and frozen feature extractor\neliminates computationally expensive fine-tuning of the backbone. This,\ncombined with a compressed buffer for efficient memory use, enables CIFNet to\nperform efficient class-incremental learning through a single-step optimization\nprocess on fixed features, minimizing computational overhead and training time\nwithout requiring multiple weight updates. Experiments on benchmark datasets\nconfirm that CIFNet effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting at the\nclassifier level, achieving high accuracy comparable to that of existing\nstate-of-the-art methods, while substantially improving training efficiency and\nsustainability. CIFNet represents a significant advancement in making\nclass-incremental learning more accessible and pragmatic in environments with\nlimited resources, especially when strong pre-trained feature extractors are\navailable."}

To\naddress this dual challenge, we propose Customized Black-box Prompt Tuning\n(CBP-Tuning), a novel framework that facilitates efficient local customization\nwhile preserving bidirectional privacy. Specifically, we design a two-stage\nframework: (1) a prompt generator trained on the server-side to capture\ndomain-specific and task-agnostic capabilities, and (2) user-side gradient-free\noptimization that tailors soft prompts for individual tasks. This approach\neliminates the need for users to access model weights or upload private data,\nrequiring only a single customized vector per task while achieving effective\nadaptation.

Therefore, LazyDrag naturally unifies precise geometric control with\ntext guidance, enabling complex edits that were previously out of reach:\nopening the mouth of a dog and inpainting its interior, generating new objects\nlike a ``tennis ball'', or for ambiguous drags, making context-aware changes\nlike moving a hand into a pocket. Additionally, LazyDrag supports multi-round\nworkflows with simultaneous move and scale operations. Evaluated on the\nDragBench, our method outperforms baselines in drag accuracy and perceptual\nquality, as validated by VIEScore and human evaluation. LazyDrag not only\nestablishes new state-of-the-art performance, but also paves a new way to\nediting paradigms."}

Then, we developed \"Dr. CaBot,\" an AI discussant designed to produce\nwritten and slide-based video presentations using only the case presentation,\nmodeling the role of the human expert in these cases.\n  RESULTS: When challenged with 377 contemporary CPCs, o3 (OpenAI) ranked the\nfinal diagnosis first in 60% of cases and within the top ten in 84% of cases,\noutperforming a 20-physician baseline; next-test selection accuracy reached\n98%. Event-level physician annotations quantified AI diagnostic accuracy per\nunit of information.

The goal is to\nobtain latent representations of the observations that capture better the\naction-relevant factors, thereby modeling better the cause-effect relationship\nfrom the observations that are mapped to the actions performed by the\ndemonstrator, for example, the player jumps whenever an obstacle appears ahead.\nWe propose an approach to integrate the SupCon loss with continuous output\nspaces, enabling SupCon to operate without constraints regarding the type of\nactions of the environment. Experiments on the 3D games Astro Bot and Returnal,\nand multiple 2D Atari games show improved representation quality, faster\nlearning convergence, and better generalization compared to baseline models\ntrained only with supervised action prediction loss functions."}

Environments are not passive testing\ngrounds and they represent the data required for agents to learn and exhibit\nvery challenging conditions that require adaptive, complex and autonomous\ncapacity to make decisions. While the paradigm of scaling models and datasets\nhas led to remarkable emergent capabilities, we argue that scaling the\nstructure, fidelity, and logical consistency of agent reasoning within these\nenvironments is a crucial, yet underexplored, dimension of AI research. This\npaper introduces a neuro-symbolic multi-agent architecture where the belief\nstates of individual agents are formally represented as Kripke models. This\nfoundational choice enables them to reason about known concepts of\n\\emph{possibility} and \\emph{necessity} using the formal language of modal\nlogic. In this work, we use of immutable, domain-specific knowledge to make\ninfere information, which is encoded as logical constraints essential for\nproper diagnosis. In the proposed model, we show constraints that actively\nguide the hypothesis generation of LMs, effectively preventing them from\nreaching physically or logically untenable conclusions. In a high-fidelity\nsimulated particle accelerator environment, our system successfully diagnoses\ncomplex, cascading failures by combining the powerful semantic intuition of LMs\nwith the rigorous, verifiable validation of modal logic and a factual world\nmodel and showcasing a viable path toward more robust, reliable, and verifiable\nautonomous agents."}

To assist\nand improve the productivity of such endeavors, we leverage the task of\nQuery-Focused Summarization (QFS). Models of this task are often impeded by the\nlinguistic dissonance between the query and the source documents. We propose\nand substantiate a multi-bias framework to help bridge this gap at a\ndomain-agnostic, generic level; we then formulate specialized approaches for\nthe problem of sentiment explanation through sentiment-based biases and query\nexpansion. We achieve experimental results outperforming baseline models on a\nreal-world proprietary sentiment-aware QFS dataset."}

Prior\nmethods rely on synthetic 3D training data consisting of mostly unoccluded and\nstatic objects, leading to poor generalization on real-world clothing. In this\npaper, we propose HoloGarment (Hologram-Garment), a method that takes 1-3\nimages or a continuous video of a person wearing a garment and generates\n360{\\deg} novel views of the garment in a canonical pose. Our key insight is to\nbridge the domain gap between real and synthetic data with a novel implicit\ntraining paradigm leveraging a combination of large-scale real video data and\nsmall-scale synthetic 3D data to optimize a shared garment embedding space.\nDuring inference, the shared embedding space further enables dynamic\nvideo-to-360{\\deg} NVS through the construction of a garment \"atlas\"\nrepresentation by finetuning a garment embedding on a specific real-world\nvideo. The atlas captures garment-specific geometry and texture across all\nviewpoints, independent of body pose or motion. Extensive experiments show that\nHoloGarment achieves state-of-the-art performance on NVS of in-the-wild\ngarments from images and videos. Notably, our method robustly handles\nchallenging real-world artifacts -- such as wrinkling, pose variation, and\nocclusion -- while maintaining photorealism, view consistency, fine texture\ndetails, and accurate geometry.
