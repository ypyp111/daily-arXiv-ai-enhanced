This discrepancy in representation prevents speech language models from performing instruction-based free-form editing. To solve this challenge, we introduce a novel framework that unifies speech understanding, generation, and editing. The core of our unified model is a unified continuous speech tokenizer MingTok-Audio, the first continuous tokenizer to effectively integrate semantic and acoustic features, which makes it suitable for both understanding and generation tasks. Based on this unified continuous audio tokenizer, we developed the speech language model Ming-UniAudio, which achieved a balance between generation and understanding capabilities. Ming-UniAudio sets new state-of-the-art (SOTA) records on 8 out of 12 metrics on the ContextASR benchmark. Notably, for Chinese voice cloning, it achieves a highly competitive Seed-TTS-WER of 0.95. Leveraging this foundational model, we further trained a dedicated speech editing model Ming-UniAudio-Edit, the first speech language model that enables universal, free-form speech editing guided solely by natural language instructions, handling both semantic and acoustic modifications without timestamp condition. To rigorously assess the editing capability and establish a foundation for future research, we introduce Ming-Freeform-Audio-Edit, the first comprehensive benchmark tailored for instruction-based free-form speech editing, featuring diverse scenarios and evaluation dimensions spanning semantic correctness, acoustic quality, and instruction alignment. We open-sourced the continuous audio tokenizer, the unified foundational model, and the free-form instruction-based editing model to facilitate the development of unified audio understanding, generation, and manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u8bed\u97f3\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8bed\u97f3\u5206\u8bcd\u5668MingTok-Audio\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bMing-UniAudio\uff0c\u5e76\u5728ContextASR\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e868/12\u6307\u6807\u7684SOTA\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u652f\u6301\u7eaf\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u901a\u7528\u81ea\u7531\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bed\u97f3\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578bMing-UniAudio-Edit\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bed\u97f3\u7f16\u8f91\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8868\u5f81\u5dee\u5f02\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u8bed\u97f3\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8bed\u97f3\u5206\u8bcd\u5668MingTok-Audio\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u58f0\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6784\u5efa\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bMing-UniAudio\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578bMing-UniAudio-Edit\uff1b\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u6307\u4ee4\u5f0f\u81ea\u7531\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bed\u97f3\u7f16\u8f91\u57fa\u51c6Ming-Freeform-Audio-Edit\u3002", "result": "\u5728ContextASR\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d8/12\u6307\u6807\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\uff1b\u4e2d\u6587\u8bed\u97f3\u514b\u9686\u7684Seed-TTS-WER\u8fbe\u52300.95\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u652f\u6301\u7eaf\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u901a\u7528\u81ea\u7531\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bed\u97f3\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8868\u5f81\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u97f3\u9891\u5904\u7406\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u6e90\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

EviBound is an evidence-bound execution framework that eliminates false claims through dual governance gates requiring machine-checkable evidence.\n  Two complementary gates enforce evidence requirements. The pre-execution Approval Gate validates acceptance criteria schemas before code runs, catching structural violations proactively. The post-execution Verification Gate validates artifacts via MLflow API queries (with recursive path checking) and optionally validates metrics when specified by acceptance criteria. Claims propagate only when backed by a queryable run ID, required artifacts, and FINISHED status. Bounded, confidence-gated retries (typically 1-2 attempts) recover from transient failures without unbounded loops.\n  The framework was evaluated on 8 benchmark tasks spanning infrastructure validation, ML capabilities, and governance stress tests. Baseline A (Prompt-Level Only) yields 100% hallucination (8/8 claimed, 0/8 verified). Baseline B (Verification-Only) reduces hallucination to 25% (2/8 fail verification). EviBound (Dual Gates) achieves 0% hallucination: 7/8 tasks verified and 1 task correctly blocked at the approval gate, all with only approximately 8.3% execution overhead.\n  This package includes execution trajectories, MLflow run IDs for all verified tasks, and a 4-step verification protocol.

However, existing methods face three critical challenges: Inaccurate Graph Construction, caused by LLM hallucination; Poor Reasoning Ability, caused by failing to generate explicit reasons telling LLM why certain chunks were selected; and Inadequate Answering, which only partially answers the query due to the inadequate LLM reasoning, making their performance lag behind NaiveRAG on certain tasks. To address these issues, we propose AGRAG, an advanced graph-based retrieval-augmented generation framework. When constructing the graph, AGRAG substitutes the widely used LLM entity extraction method with a statistics-based method, avoiding hallucination and error propagation. When retrieval, AGRAG formulates the graph reasoning procedure as the Minimum Cost Maximum Influence (MCMI) subgraph generation problem, where we try to include more nodes with high influence score, but with less involving edge cost, to make the generated reasoning paths more comprehensive. We prove this problem to be NP-hard, and propose a greedy algorithm to solve it. The MCMI subgraph generated can serve as explicit reasoning paths to tell LLM why certain chunks were retrieved, thereby making the LLM better focus on the query-related part contents of the chunks, reducing the impact of noise, and improving AGRAG's reasoning ability.

Existing data extraction methods, particularly heuristic-based divergence attacks, often exhibit limited success and offer limited insight into the fundamental drivers of memorization leakage. This paper introduces Confusion-Inducing Attacks (CIA), a principled framework for extracting memorized data by systematically maximizing model uncertainty. We empirically demonstrate that the emission of memorized text during divergence is preceded by a sustained spike in token-level prediction entropy. CIA leverages this insight by optimizing input snippets to deliberately induce this consecutive high-entropy state. For aligned LLMs, we further propose Mismatched Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to simultaneously weaken their alignment and induce targeted confusion, thereby increasing susceptibility to our attacks. Experiments on various unaligned and aligned LLMs demonstrate that our proposed attacks outperform existing baselines in extracting verbatim and near-verbatim training data without requiring prior knowledge of the training data. Our findings highlight persistent memorization risks across various LLMs and offer a more systematic method for assessing these vulnerabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faConfusion-Inducing Attacks (CIA)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u63d0\u53d6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cdLLM\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5f15\u53d1\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u7248\u6743\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6cc4\u9732\u6839\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "CIA\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u8f93\u5165\u7247\u6bb5\u6545\u610f\u8bf1\u5bfc\u8fde\u7eed\u9ad8\u71b5\u72b6\u6001\u6765\u63d0\u53d6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u5bf9\u5bf9\u9f50LLM\u63d0\u51faMismatched SFT\u540c\u65f6\u524a\u5f31\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e76\u8bf1\u5bfc\u76ee\u6807\u6df7\u6dc6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eCIA\u5728\u63d0\u53d6\u9010\u5b57\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9010\u5b57\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5404\u79cdLLM\u5b58\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We introduce SMAGDi, a distillation framework that transfers the debate dynamics of a five-agent Llama-based MAS into a compact Socratic decomposer-solver student. SMAGDi represents debate traces as directed interaction graphs, where nodes encode intermediate reasoning steps with correctness labels and edges capture continuity and cross-agent influence. The student is trained with a composite objective combining language modeling, graph-based supervision, contrastive reasoning, and embedding alignment to preserve both fluency and structured reasoning. On StrategyQA and MMLU, SMAGDi compresses a 40B multi-agent system into a 6B student while retaining 88% of its accuracy, substantially outperforming prior distillation methods such as MAGDi, standard KD, and fine-tuned baselines.

The formulation yields a single global-pressure equation driving the total Darcy flux and an exact fractional-flow decomposition of phase velocities with buoyancy and capillary drifts; inertial effects enter as per-phase damping that renormalizes mobilities. Crucially, the combination of Maxwell--Stefan diffusion and dynamic capillarity renders transport pseudo-parabolic, resolving the loss of strict hyperbolicity that plagues three-phase Buckley--Leverett and ensuring a well-posed initial-value problem. In practice, each time step solves the scalar global-pressure equation, reconstructs phase fluxes via the split, and advances strictly conservative component balances; axisymmetric (cylindrical) forms for radial injection with vertical buoyancy are provided.

Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark (720 scenarios, over 11,000 samples) using perception-informed BEV representations yield three key findings: (1) even without future prediction, our sparse representation achieves 0.548 m ADE, comparable to or surpassing prior methods reporting around 0.75 m on nuScenes; (2) conditioning trajectory decoding on predicted future tokens reduces ADE to 0.479 m, a 12.6% improvement over current-state baselines; and (3) explicit reconstruction loss offers no benefit and may degrade performance under reliable perception inputs. Notably, we observe the emergence of temporal fuzziness, where the model adaptively attends to task-relevant semantics rather than aligning rigidly to fixed timestamps, providing a cognitive advantage for planning under uncertainty. Our \"token is all you need\" principle marks a paradigm shift from reconstructing the world to understanding it, laying a foundation for cognitively inspired systems that plan through imagination rather than reaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6311\u6218\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u9700\u8981\u8be6\u5c3d\u573a\u666f\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684token\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5728nuPlan\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u6311\u6218\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u672a\u6765\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u6216\u53d7\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u5047\u8bbe\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u7b80\u6d01\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u611f\u77e5\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684BEV\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u8bed\u4e49token\u8fdb\u884c\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6709\u65e0\u672a\u6765\u9884\u6d4btoken\u5bf9\u8f68\u8ff9\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7a00\u758f\u8868\u793a\u5728\u65e0\u672a\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u8fbe\u52300.548m ADE\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u52a0\u5165\u672a\u6765token\u9884\u6d4b\u540eADE\u964d\u81f30.479m\uff0c\u63d0\u534712.6%\uff1b\u663e\u5f0f\u91cd\u5efa\u635f\u5931\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u611f\u77e5\u4e0b\u65e0\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\"token\u5373\u6240\u9700\"\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u4ece\u91cd\u5efa\u4e16\u754c\u8f6c\u5411\u7406\u89e3\u4e16\u754c\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u60f3\u8c61\u800c\u975e\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u542f\u53d1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

For $r>1$ and non-commuting symbols, numerical evidence shows the sequence still admits a spectral symbol, indicating maximality of the commuting result.

However, prevailing moderation systems are centralized and task-specific, offering limited transparency and neglecting diverse user preferences--an approach ill-suited for privacy-sensitive or decentralized environments. We propose a novel framework that leverages in-context learning (ICL) with foundation models to unify the detection of toxicity, spam, and negative sentiment across binary, multi-class, and multi-label settings. Crucially, our approach enables lightweight personalization, allowing users to easily block new categories, unblock existing ones, or extend detection to semantic variations through simple prompt-based interventions--all without model retraining. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks (TextDetox, UCI SMS, SST2) and a new, annotated Mastodon dataset reveal that: (i) foundation models achieve strong cross-task generalization, often matching or surpassing task-specific fine-tuned models; (ii) effective personalization is achievable with as few as one user-provided example or definition; and (iii) augmenting prompts with label definitions or rationales significantly enhances robustness to noisy, real-world data. Our work demonstrates a definitive shift beyond one-size-fits-all moderation, establishing ICL as a practical, privacy-preserving, and highly adaptable pathway for the next generation of user-centric content safety systems.

Deploying these models requires energy-intensive GPU infrastructure, and in some cases has even prompted plans to power data centers with nuclear energy. Despite this growing relevance, systematic analyses of inference energy consumption remain limited. In this work, we present a large-scale measurement-based study comprising over 32,500 measurements across 21 GPU configurations and 155 model architectures, from small open-source models to frontier systems. Using the vLLM inference engine, we quantify energy usage at the prompt level and identify how architectural and operational factors shape energy demand. Building on these insights, we develop a predictive model that accurately estimates inference energy consumption across unseen architectures and hardware, and implement it as a browser extension to raise awareness of the environmental impact of generative AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u8017\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6d4b\u91cf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6db5\u76d632,500\u591a\u6b21\u6d4b\u91cf\u300121\u79cdGPU\u914d\u7f6e\u548c155\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u4f30\u7b97\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6269\u5c55\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u63a8\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5f80\u5f80\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6574\u4e2a\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u4f46\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u8017\u5206\u6790\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528vLLM\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u572821\u79cdGPU\u914d\u7f6e\u548c155\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c32,500\u591a\u6b21\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u56e0\u7d20\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u80fd\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d4b\u91cf\u6d1e\u5bdf\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u7b97\u672a\u89c1\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3a\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u6269\u5c55\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9LLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u610f\u8bc6\u3002"}}

However, this index is only reported annually, limiting its responsiveness to short-term fluctuations. To address this gap, the present study introduces a daily proxy for the Energy Security Index and applies it to forecast energy security at a daily frequency.The study employs a two stage approach first, a suitable daily proxy for the annual Energy Security Index is identified by applying six time series similarity measures to key energy related variables. Second, the selected proxy is modeled using the XGBoost algorithm to generate 15 day ahead forecasts, enabling high frequency monitoring of energy security dynamics.As the result of proxy choosing, Volume Brent consistently emerged as the most suitable proxy across the majority of methods. The model demonstrated strong performance, with an R squared of 0.981 on the training set and 0.945 on the test set, and acceptable error metrics . The 15 day forecast of Brent volume indicates short term fluctuations, with a peak around day 4, a decline until day 8, a rise near day 10, and a downward trend toward day 15, accompanied by prediction intervals.By integrating time series similarity measures with machine learning based forecasting, this study provides a novel framework for converting low frequency macroeconomic indicators into high frequency, actionable signals. The approach enables real time monitoring of the Energy Security Index, offering policymakers and analysts a scalable and practical tool to respond more rapidly to fast changing policy and market conditions, especially in data scarce environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6bcf\u65e5\u80fd\u6e90\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u6570\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528XGBoost\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c15\u5929\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5e74\u5ea6\u6307\u6570\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0d\u53ca\u65f6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u653f\u7b56\u73af\u5883\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u80fd\u6e90\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u6570\u4ec5\u6bcf\u5e74\u62a5\u544a\u4e00\u6b21\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u54cd\u5e94\u77ed\u671f\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u9891\u76d1\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u516d\u79cd\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u9009\u62e9\u6bcf\u65e5\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u7528XGBoost\u7b97\u6cd5\u5efa\u6a21\u751f\u621015\u5929\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5e03\u4f26\u7279\u539f\u6cb9\u4ea4\u6613\u91cf\u88ab\u9009\u4e3a\u6700\u4f73\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6R\u5e73\u65b90.981\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c60.945\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u663e\u793a\u77ed\u671f\u6ce2\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u4f4e\u9891\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6307\u6807\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u9ad8\u9891\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

Within this framework, we define a quadratic loss functional as in the least square method with $h-$refinement and introduce new discretization sets spanned by element-wise neural network functions. The desired neural network approximate solution is recursively supplemented by solving a sequence of quasi-minimization problems associated with the underlying loss functionals and the adaptively augmented discontinuous neural network sets without the assumption on the boundedness of the neural network parameters. We further propose a discontinuous Galerkin Trefftz neural network discretization (DGTNN) only with a single hidden layer to reduce the computational costs. Moreover, we design a template based on the considered models for initializing nonlinear weights. Numerical experiments confirm that compared to existing PINN algorithms, the proposed DGNN method with one or two hidden layers is able to improve the relative $L^2$ error by at least one order of magnitude at low computational costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u62bd\u8c61\u95f4\u65ad\u4f3d\u8fbd\u91d1\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b8b\u5dee\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u53ef\u884c\u89e3\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7h-\u7ec6\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e8c\u6b21\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7531\u9010\u5143\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u51fd\u6570\u5f20\u6210\u7684\u65b0\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u96c6\u5408\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfPINN\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u76f8\u5bf9L^2\u8bef\u5dee\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDGNN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9012\u5f52\u6c42\u89e3\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4e0e\u57fa\u7840\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u95f4\u65ad\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u96c6\u5408\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u62df\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5047\u8bbe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u53c2\u6570\u6709\u754c\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51fa\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u7684DGTNN\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u8003\u8651\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6a21\u677f\u6765\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709PINN\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u6216\u4e24\u4e2a\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u7684DGNN\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5c06\u76f8\u5bf9L^2\u8bef\u5dee\u63d0\u9ad8\u81f3\u5c11\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "DGNN\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

This paper investigates efficient CoT transfer across models of different scales and architectures through an adaptive reasoning summarization framework. The proposed method compresses reasoning traces via semantic segmentation with importance scoring, budget-aware dynamic compression, and coherence reconstruction, preserving critical reasoning steps while significantly reducing token usage. Experiments on 7{,}501 medical examination questions across 10 specialties show up to 40% higher accuracy than truncation under the same token budgets. Evaluations on 64 model pairs from eight LLMs (1.5B-32B parameters, including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3) confirm strong cross-model transferability. Furthermore, a Gaussian Process-based Bayesian optimization module reduces evaluation cost by 84% and reveals a power-law relationship between model size and cross-domain robustness. These results demonstrate that reasoning summarization provides a practical path toward efficient CoT transfer, enabling advanced reasoning under tight computational constraints.

Measurements obtained over the last two years, on the centerline of the pipe in the fully developed test section, with Pitot probes for the mean velocity in the stream ($\\pm 0.2\\%$ precision) and hot wires for the intensity of turbulence in the streamwise and the normal stress ( $\\pm~5\\%$ precision) are reported here and compared to other experimental results and some recent direct numerical simulation (DNS) data. The comparisons reveal that high Reynolds number conditions are only reached when $Re_\u03c4$ is at least larger than $10,000$. The centerline von K\u00e0rm\u00e0n constant, $\u03ba_{CL}$ for pipe flow is confirmed with high confidence to be $0.44$. Unlike previously reported measurements on the pipe centerline of the streamwise turbulence intensity and normal stress reported in the literature with various conflicting trends, both quantities are found in CICLoPE to reach a level trend beyond $Re_\u03c4$ around $25,000$ with values of approximately $2.9\\%$ and $0.85$, respectively. Normalized streamwise velocity spectra on the centerline, with high resolution over seven decades of energy, exhibit a clear and extended $-5/3$ inertial range. Skewness and kurtosis of streamwise velocity are found to be independent of Reynolds number even down to $Re_\u03c4= 5,000$ and equal to $-0.5$ and $3.5$, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "CICLoPE\u8bbe\u65bd\u5728Re_\u03c4=50,000\u7684\u9ad8\u96f7\u8bfa\u6570\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b8c\u5168\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u7ba1\u6d41\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u7ba1\u6d41\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ebf\u7684\u51af\u00b7\u5361\u95e8\u5e38\u6570\u4e3a0.44\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6d41\u7ebf\u6e4d\u6d41\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u6cd5\u5411\u5e94\u529b\u5728Re_\u03c4>25,000\u65f6\u8d8b\u4e8e\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u4e3a2.9%\u548c0.85\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u9ad8\u96f7\u8bfa\u6570\u7ba1\u6d41\u7684\u6e4d\u6d41\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u5173\u4e8e\u6d41\u7ebf\u6e4d\u6d41\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u6cd5\u5411\u5e94\u529b\u8d8b\u52bf\u7684\u4e89\u8bae\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51af\u00b7\u5361\u95e8\u5e38\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u5728CICLoPE\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u76ae\u6258\u7ba1\u6d4b\u91cf\u5e73\u5747\u901f\u5ea6\uff08\u00b10.2%\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff09\u548c\u70ed\u7ebf\u6d4b\u91cf\u6e4d\u6d41\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff08\u00b15%\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eDNS\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u9ad8\u96f7\u8bfa\u6570\u6761\u4ef6\u9700Re_\u03c4>10,000\uff1b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ebf\u51af\u00b7\u5361\u95e8\u5e38\u6570\u03ba_CL=0.44\uff1b\u6d41\u7ebf\u6e4d\u6d41\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u6cd5\u5411\u5e94\u529b\u5728Re_\u03c4>25,000\u65f6\u7a33\u5b9a\u57282.9%\u548c0.85\uff1b\u901f\u5ea6\u8c31\u663e\u793a\u6e05\u6670\u7684-5/3\u60ef\u6027\u533a\uff1b\u504f\u5ea6\u548c\u5cf0\u5ea6\u4e0e\u96f7\u8bfa\u6570\u65e0\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "CICLoPE\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u9ad8\u96f7\u8bfa\u6570\u7ba1\u6d41\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u4e89\u8bae\uff0c\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u6e4d\u6d41\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

However, data collection and model training can be expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we leverage vision-language models' (VLMs') reasoning capabilities to assess the quality of printed parts and introduce in-context learning (ICL) to provide VLMs with necessary application-specific knowledge and demonstration samples. This method eliminates the requirement for large application-specific datasets for training models. We explored different sampling strategies for ICL to search for the optimal configuration that makes use of limited samples. We evaluated these strategies on two VLMs, Gemini-2.5-flash and Gemma3:27b, with quality assessment tasks in wire-laser direct energy deposition processes. The results show that ICL-assisted VLMs can reach quality classification accuracies similar to those of traditional machine learning models while requiring only a minimal number of samples. In addition, unlike traditional classification models that lack transparency, VLMs can generate human-interpretable rationales to enhance trust. Since there are no metrics to evaluate their interpretability in manufacturing applications, we propose two metrics, knowledge relevance and rationale validity, to evaluate the quality of VLMs' supporting rationales. Our results show that ICL-assisted VLMs can address application-specific tasks with limited data, achieving relatively high accuracy while also providing valid supporting rationales for improved decision transparency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u8fdb\u884c\u589e\u6750\u5236\u9020\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e94\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u589e\u6750\u5236\u9020\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u8017\u65f6\u957f", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e94\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u6f14\u793a\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540c\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u5bfb\u627e\u6700\u4f18\u914d\u7f6e", "result": "ICL\u8f85\u52a9\u7684VLM\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u4f9d\u636e", "conclusion": "ICL\u8f85\u52a9\u7684VLM\u80fd\u591f\u7528\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u89e3\u51b3\u5e94\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f83\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u51b3\u7b56\u900f\u660e\u5ea6"}}

DDM was proposed to resolve content misalignment issues in unpaired domain translation, achieving translation identifiability. However, DDM has only been implemented using GANs due to its constraints on the translation function. GANs are often unstable to train and do not provide the transport trajectory information -- yet such trajectories are useful in applications such as single-cell evolution analysis and robot route planning. This work introduces diversified flow matching (DFM), an ODE-based framework for DDM. Adapting flow matching (FM) to enforce a unified translation function as in DDM is challenging, as FM learns the translation function's velocity rather than the translation function itself. A custom bilevel optimization-based training loss, a nonlinear interpolant, and a structural reformulation are proposed to address these challenges, offering a tangible implementation. To our knowledge, DFM is the first ODE-based approach guaranteeing translation identifiability.

This work introduces FlowMM, an adaptive framework for cross-modal information flow-guided multimodal KV cache merging. FlowMM leverages cross-modal information flow to dynamically apply layer-specific merging strategies, capturing modality-specific patterns while preserving contextual integrity. Furthermore, we introduce a sensitivity-adaptive token matching mechanism that jointly evaluates token similarity and task-critical sensitivity, merging low-risk tokens while safeguarding high-sensitivity ones. Extensive experiments across diverse leading MLLMs show that FlowMM reduces KV cache memory by 80% to 95% and decoding latency by 1.3-1.8x, while maintaining competitive task performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlowMM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5408\u5e76\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u7279\u5b9a\u5408\u5e76\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4ee4\u724c\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c1180-95% KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5185\u5b58\u548c1.3-1.8\u500d\u89e3\u7801\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfKV\u7f13\u5b58\u6dd8\u6c70\u7b56\u7565\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684KV\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u52a8\u6001\u5e94\u7528\u5c42\u7279\u5b9a\u5408\u5e76\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4ee4\u724c\u5339\u914d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee4\u724c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5173\u952e\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u9886\u5148MLLMs\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFlowMM\u51cf\u5c1180-95% KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5185\u5b58\u548c1.3-1.8\u500d\u89e3\u7801\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "FlowMM\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5408\u5e76\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Anchoring bias, a classic human judgment bias, offers a critical test case. While prior work shows LLMs exhibit anchoring, most evidence relies on surface-level outputs, leaving internal mechanisms and attributional contributions unexplored. This paper advances the study of anchoring in LLMs through three contributions: (1) a log-probability-based behavioral analysis showing that anchors shift entire output distributions, with controls for training-data contamination; (2) exact Shapley-value attribution over structured prompt fields to quantify anchor influence on model log-probabilities; and (3) a unified Anchoring Bias Sensitivity Score integrating behavioral and attributional evidence across six open-source models. Results reveal robust anchoring effects in Gemma-2B, Phi-2, and Llama-2-7B, with attribution signaling that the anchors influence reweighting. Smaller models such as GPT-2, Falcon-RW-1B, and GPT-Neo-125M show variability, suggesting scale may modulate sensitivity. Attributional effects, however, vary across prompt designs, underscoring fragility in treating LLMs as human substitutes. The findings demonstrate that anchoring bias in LLMs is robust, measurable, and interpretable, while highlighting risks in applied domains. More broadly, the framework bridges behavioral science, LLM safety, and interpretability, offering a reproducible path for evaluating other cognitive biases in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u951a\u5b9a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u951a\u70b9\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\u6574\u4e2a\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8LLMs\u7684\u8868\u9762\u8f93\u51fa\u662f\u5426\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u951a\u5b9a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5f52\u56e0\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u533a\u5206\u8868\u9762\u6a21\u4eff\u548c\u6df1\u5c42\u6982\u7387\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a(1)\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6570\u6982\u7387\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\uff1b(2)\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u5b57\u6bb5\u7684\u7cbe\u786eShapley\u503c\u5f52\u56e0\uff1b(3)\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u951a\u5b9a\u504f\u89c1\u654f\u611f\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u5f52\u56e0\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "result": "Gemma-2B\u3001Phi-2\u548cLlama-2-7B\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u951a\u5b9a\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u951a\u70b9\u5f71\u54cd\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u6743\uff1b\u8f83\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5982GPT-2\u3001Falcon-RW-1B\u548cGPT-Neo-125M\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e0d\u4e00\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u89c4\u6a21\u53ef\u80fd\u8c03\u8282\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002\u5f52\u56e0\u6548\u5e94\u968f\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u951a\u5b9a\u504f\u89c1\u662f\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\u5b58\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u4e2d\u5176\u4ed6\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

This study presents a systematic experimental investigation of evaporation dynamics in multi-droplet configurations under ambient conditions, comparing completely pinned and partially pinned contact line modes. Completely pinned droplets are generated by introducing alumina nanoparticles, while partially pinned droplets consist of pure water. An isolated droplet is compared with arrays of two, three, and five droplets, each arranged at a fixed spacing ratio. High-speed shadowgraphy is used to measure droplet height, contact angle, volume, and lifetime. Results show that, although completely pinned droplets evaporate faster in absolute terms due to a constant contact radius, they experience a more pronounced relative lifetime increase from vapor shielding than partially pinned droplets. In five-droplet configurations, lifetimes increase by up to 89% and 124% compared to isolated droplets for partially pinned and completely pinned modes, respectively. A theoretical model incorporating evaporative cooling predicts central droplet lifetimes with good agreement. These findings underscore the coupled influence of contact line mobility and droplet proximity on evaporation rates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u6db2\u6ef4\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u84b8\u53d1\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5b8c\u5168\u9489\u624e\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u9489\u624e\u63a5\u89e6\u7ebf\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b8c\u5168\u9489\u624e\u6db2\u6ef4\u867d\u7136\u84b8\u53d1\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u4f46\u84b8\u6c7d\u5c4f\u853d\u6548\u5e94\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u5bff\u547d\u589e\u52a0\u66f4\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u7d27\u5bc6\u6392\u5217\u7684\u6db2\u6ef4\u84b8\u53d1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u7684\u84b8\u6c7d-\u84b8\u6c7d\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5c4f\u853d\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u6548\u5e94\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u5ef6\u957f\u6db2\u6ef4\u5bff\u547d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u901f\u9634\u5f71\u6210\u50cf\u6280\u672f\u6d4b\u91cf\u6db2\u6ef4\u9ad8\u5ea6\u3001\u63a5\u89e6\u89d2\u3001\u4f53\u79ef\u548c\u5bff\u547d\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5b64\u7acb\u6db2\u6ef4\u4e0e\u4e8c\u3001\u4e09\u3001\u4e94\u6db2\u6ef4\u9635\u5217\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u9489\u624e\u6db2\u6ef4\u901a\u8fc7\u6dfb\u52a0\u6c27\u5316\u94dd\u7eb3\u7c73\u9897\u7c92\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u9489\u624e\u6db2\u6ef4\u4e3a\u7eaf\u6c34\u3002", "result": "\u4e94\u6db2\u6ef4\u914d\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u9489\u624e\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u9489\u624e\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6db2\u6ef4\u5bff\u547d\u76f8\u6bd4\u5b64\u7acb\u6db2\u6ef4\u5206\u522b\u589e\u52a089%\u548c124%\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u9489\u624e\u6db2\u6ef4\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u5bff\u547d\u589e\u52a0\u66f4\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a5\u89e6\u7ebf\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u6db2\u6ef4\u95f4\u8ddd\u5bf9\u84b8\u53d1\u901f\u7387\u5177\u6709\u8026\u5408\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u84b8\u6c7d\u5c4f\u853d\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u9489\u624e\u6db2\u6ef4\u4e2d\u66f4\u4e3a\u660e\u663e\u3002"}}

For generation, we directly learn the joint distribution of discrete images for one-step visual synthesis, enabling coordinated language-visual modeling through learnable cross-modal attention mechanisms. \\textbf{2) Dynamic Perception Pretraining}: We propose a bidirectional dynamic alignment strategy employing inverse dynamics tasks and forward dynamics tasks, effectively strengthening multimodal correlations within a unified feature space. \\textbf{3) Reinforced Supervised Fine-Tuning}: While conducting instruction-based fine-tuning in the unified generation space, we construct a reinforce loss to align the spatial logic between textual actions and generated images, enabling the model to acquire spatio-awared multimodal planning capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "EVLP\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7edf\u4e00\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u6587\u672c\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u7a7a\u95f4\u60f3\u8c61\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1\uff09\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5411\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\uff1b3\uff09\u5f3a\u5316\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5f3a\u5316\u635f\u5931\u6765\u5bf9\u9f50\u6587\u672c\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u903b\u8f91\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u8bed\u8a00-\u89c6\u89c9\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u6b65\u89c6\u89c9\u5408\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "EVLP\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u751f\u6210\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce Iterative Reward-Guided Refinement (IterRef), a novel test-time scaling method tailored to discrete diffusion that leverages reward-guided noising-denoising transitions to progressively refine misaligned intermediate states. We formalize this process within a Multiple-Try Metropolis (MTM) framework, proving convergence to the reward-aligned distribution. Unlike prior methods that assume the current state is already aligned with the reward distribution and only guide the subsequent transition, our approach explicitly refines each state in situ, progressively steering it toward the optimal intermediate distribution. Across both text and image domains, we evaluate IterRef on diverse discrete diffusion models and observe consistent improvements in reward-guided generation quality.

One way to address this is exit wave reconstruction, i.e., the recovery of the complex-valued electron wave at the specimen's exit plane from intensity-only measurements. This is an inverse problem with a nonlinear forward model. We consider a simplified forward model, making the problem equivalent to phase retrieval, and propose a discretized regularized variational formulation. To solve the resulting non-convex problem, we employ the proximal gradient algorithm (PGA) and unfold its iterations into a neural network, where each layer corresponds to one PGA step with learnable parameters. This unrolling approach, inspired by LISTA, enables improved reconstruction quality, interpretability, and implicit dictionary learning from data. We analyze the effect of parameter perturbations and show that they can accumulate exponentially with the number of layers $L$. Building on proof techniques of Behboodi et al., originally developed for LISTA, i.e., for a linear forward model, we extend the analysis to our nonlinear setting and establish generalization error bounds of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{L})$.

Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion generate high-quality images and videos from text. Evidence shows rapid expansion: 74.2% of newly published webpages now contain AI-generated material (Ryan Law 2025), 30-40% of the active web corpus is synthetic (Spennemann 2025; arXiv:2504.08755), 52% of U.S. adults use LLMs for writing, coding, or research (Staff 2025), and audits find AI involvement in 18% of financial complaints and 24% of press releases (Liang et al. 2025). The underlying neural architectures, including Transformers (Vaswani et al. 2023; arXiv:1706.03762), RNNs, LSTMs, GANs, and diffusion networks, depend on large, diverse, human-authored datasets (Shi & Iyengar 2019). As synthetic content dominates, recursive training risks eroding linguistic and semantic diversity, producing Model Collapse (Shumailov et al. 2024; arXiv:2307.15043; Dohmatob et al. 2024; arXiv:2402.07712). This study quantifies and forecasts collapse onset by examining year-wise semantic similarity in English-language Wikipedia (filtered Common Crawl) from 2013 to 2025 using Transformer embeddings and cosine similarity metrics. Results reveal a steady rise in similarity before public LLM adoption, likely driven by early RNN/LSTM translation and text-normalization pipelines, though modest due to a smaller scale.

We present \\texttt{DiagnoLLM}, a hybrid framework that integrates Bayesian deconvolution, eQTL-guided deep learning, and LLM-based narrative generation for interpretable disease diagnosis.

These features, combined with regulatory priors from eQTL analysis, power a neural classifier that achieves high predictive performance in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection (88.0\\% accuracy). To support human understanding and trust, we introduce an LLM-based reasoning module that translates model outputs into audience-specific diagnostic reports, grounded in clinical features, attribution signals, and domain knowledge.

When freezing occurs in saline water, the newly formed ice is mushy, with a porous structure that traps the brine within the ice. In this work, which combines experiments and theoretical analyses, we investigate the long-term evolution of saline ice, comprehensively accounting for the coupled dynamics of multiscale fluid flow, heat and mass transfer, and phase change. We show that in a closed convective system the rapid formation of a mushy ice layer is followed by desalination (i.e, the expulsion of salt from the ice) processes that might lead to a slow asymptotic decrease of the ice thickness. Desalination of mushy ice reduces its porosity, which alters the dynamic thermal equilibrium and ice thickness by weakening buoyancy-driven convection within the mushy layer. In turn, changes in brine convection and ice thickness affect the further desalination of the ice. The long-term dynamics of the system can be accurately predicted by a one-dimensional model based on appropriate parameterizations of global heat and mass transfer properties. Furthermore, within the same theoretical model we explore the ice dynamics across a broader parameter space. Our findings advance the understanding of the coupled phase-change physics of saline solutions in the presence of convective fluid flows and provide a basis for explaining and predicting real-world phenomena such as the aging of sea ice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u76d0\u6c34\u7ed3\u51b0\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u591a\u5b54\u51b0\u5c42\u7684\u957f\u671f\u6f14\u5316\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8131\u76d0\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\u51b0\u5c42\u539a\u5ea6\u548c\u70ed\u5e73\u8861\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u6db2\u56fa\u76f8\u53d8\u4e0e\u6d41\u4f53\u6d41\u52a8\u7684\u8026\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5730\u7403\u7269\u7406\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u76d0\u6c34\u7ed3\u51b0\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u591a\u5b54\u51b0\u5c42\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u7ef4\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5168\u5c40\u70ed\u8d28\u4f20\u9012\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6d41\u4f53\u6d41\u52a8\u3001\u70ed\u8d28\u4f20\u9012\u548c\u76f8\u53d8\u7684\u8026\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5c01\u95ed\u5bf9\u6d41\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u591a\u5b54\u51b0\u5c42\u5feb\u901f\u5f62\u6210\u540e\u4f1a\u53d1\u751f\u8131\u76d0\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u51b0\u5c42\u539a\u5ea6\u7f13\u6162\u6e10\u8fd1\u51cf\u5c0f\uff1b\u8131\u76d0\u964d\u4f4e\u5b54\u9699\u7387\uff0c\u524a\u5f31\u6d6e\u529b\u9a71\u52a8\u5bf9\u6d41\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8131\u76d0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u5bf9\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u6d41\u6d41\u4f53\u6d41\u52a8\u65f6\u76d0\u6c34\u6eb6\u6db2\u8026\u5408\u76f8\u53d8\u7269\u7406\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6d77\u51b0\u8001\u5316\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Despite the integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into MVC, their input graph structures remain susceptible to noise interference. Methods based on Multi-view Graph Refinement (MGRC) also have limitations such as insufficient consideration of cross-view consistency, difficulty in handling hard-to-distinguish samples in the feature space, and disjointed optimization processes caused by graph construction algorithms. To address these issues, a Multi-View Clustering method via a Fusion-Consensus Graph Convolutional Network (MCFCN) is proposed. The network learns the consensus graph of multi-view data in an end-to-end manner and learns effective consensus representations through a view feature fusion model and a Unified Graph Structure Adapter (UGA). It designs Similarity Matrix Alignment Loss (SMAL) and Feature Representation Alignment Loss (FRAL).

Prevailing heuristics, such as confidence based sampling, are myopic: they optimize locally, fail to leverage extra test-time compute, and let early decoding mistakes cascade. We propose Lookahead Unmasking (LookUM), which addresses these concerns by reformulating sampling as path selection over all possible unmasking orders without the need for an external reward model. Our framework couples (i) a path generator that proposes paths by sampling from pools of unmasking sets with (ii) a verifier that computes the uncertainty of the proposed paths and performs importance sampling to subsequently select the final paths. Empirically, erroneous unmasking measurably inflates sequence level uncertainty, and our method exploits this to avoid error-prone trajectories. We validate our framework across six benchmarks, such as mathematics, planning, and coding, and demonstrate consistent performance improvements. LookUM requires only two to three paths to achieve peak performance, demonstrating remarkably efficient path selection. The consistent improvements on both LLaDA and post-trained LLaDA 1.5 are particularly striking: base LLaDA with LookUM rivals the performance of RL-tuned LLaDA 1.5, while LookUM further enhances LLaDA 1.5 itself showing that uncertainty based verification provides orthogonal benefits to reinforcement learning and underscoring the versatility of our framework.

Additionally, the consistency requirement for phase-field modeling brings difficulties to the construction of nonlinear potentials in the energy functionals, posing significant challenges for classical phase-field modeling and its numerical methods for problems involving many phases. In this work, by adopting a dichotomic approach to represent multiphase, we propose a novel phase-field modeling framework without simplex constraint,in which the free energy is interpolated from the classical two-phase Ginzburg-Landau free energies. We systematically establish the interpolation rules and explicitly construct the interpolation functions, rendering the consistency properties of the model. The proposed model enjoys an energy dissipation property and is shown to be asymptotically consistent with its sharp interface limit, with the Neumann triangle condition recovered at the triple junction.Based on a mobility operator splitting technique, we develop a linear, decoupled, and energy stable scheme for efficiently solving the system of phase-field equations. The numerical stability and accuracy, as well as the consistency properties of the model, are validated through a large number of numerical examples. In particular, the model demonstrates its success in several benchmark simulations for multiphase problems, such as the formation of liquid lenses between two stratified fluids, the generation of double emulsions and Janus emulsions, showing good agreement with experimental observations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u591a\u76f8\u76f8\u573a\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u5206\u6cd5\u8868\u793a\u591a\u76f8\uff0c\u4ece\u7ecf\u5178\u4e24\u76f8Ginzburg-Landau\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u63d2\u503c\u6784\u9020\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u63d2\u503c\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u80fd\u91cf\u8017\u6563\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u76f8\u76f8\u573a\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u6ee1\u8db3\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4e14\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u7ed9\u80fd\u91cf\u6cdb\u51fd\u4e2d\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52bf\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u5e26\u6765\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u8fd9\u7ed9\u6d89\u53ca\u591a\u76f8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e8c\u5206\u6cd5\u8868\u793a\u591a\u76f8\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u76f8\u573a\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d2\u503c\u7ecf\u5178\u4e24\u76f8Ginzburg-Landau\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u6765\u6784\u9020\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u7acb\u63d2\u503c\u89c4\u5219\u5e76\u663e\u5f0f\u6784\u9020\u63d2\u503c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc1\u79fb\u7387\u7b97\u5b50\u5206\u88c2\u6280\u672f\u5f00\u53d1\u7ebf\u6027\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u80fd\u91cf\u8017\u6563\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6e10\u8fd1\u4e00\u81f4\u4e8e\u5176\u5c16\u9510\u754c\u9762\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u76f8\u70b9\u5904\u6062\u590dNeumann\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u6570\u503c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u591a\u76f8\u95ee\u9898\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5982\u4e24\u5c42\u6d41\u4f53\u95f4\u6db2\u900f\u955c\u5f62\u6210\u3001\u53cc\u4e73\u6db2\u548cJanus\u4e73\u6db2\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c2\u5bdf\u543b\u5408\u826f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65e0\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62\u7ea6\u675f\u76f8\u573a\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u76f8\u76f8\u573a\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d2\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6848\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u591a\u76f8\u95ee\u9898\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Calmon"], "title": "Temporal Sparse Autoencoders: Leveraging the Sequential Nature of Language for Interpretability", "comment": "23 Pages, 10 figures", "summary": "Translating the internal representations and computations of models into concepts that humans can understand is a key goal of interpretability. While recent dictionary learning methods such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) provide a promising route to discover human-interpretable features, they suffer from a variety of problems, including a systematic failure to capture the rich conceptual information that drives linguistic understanding. Instead, they exhibit a bias towards shallow, token-specific, or noisy features, such as \"the phrase 'The' at the start of sentences\". In this work, we propose that this is due to a fundamental issue with how dictionary learning methods for LLMs are trained. Language itself has a rich, well-studied structure spanning syntax, semantics, and pragmatics; however, current unsupervised methods largely ignore this linguistic knowledge, leading to poor feature discovery that favors superficial patterns over meaningful concepts. We focus on a simple but important aspect of language: semantic content has long-range dependencies and tends to be smooth over a sequence, whereas syntactic information is much more local. Building on this insight, we introduce Temporal Sparse Autoencoders (T-SAEs), which incorporate a novel contrastive loss encouraging consistent activations of high-level features over adjacent tokens.

Dynamic Learning and Proactive Correction for Hallucination Detection", "comment": null, "summary": "Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) remains a critical barrier to their safe deployment. Existing tool-augmented hallucination detection methods require pre-defined fixed verification strategies, which are crucial to the quality and effectiveness of tool calls. Some methods directly employ powerful closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4 as detectors, which are effective but too costly. To mitigate the cost issue, some methods adopt the teacher-student architecture and finetune open-source small models as detectors via agent tuning. However, these methods are limited by fixed strategies. When faced with a dynamically changing execution environment, they may lack adaptability and inappropriately call tools, ultimately leading to detection failure. To address the problem of insufficient strategy adaptability, we propose the innovative ``Learning to Evaluate and Adaptively Plan''(LEAP) framework, which endows an efficient student model with the dynamic learning and proactive correction capabilities of the teacher model. Specifically, our method formulates the hallucination detection problem as a dynamic strategy learning problem. We first employ a teacher model to generate trajectories within the dynamic learning loop and dynamically adjust the strategy based on execution failures. We then distill this dynamic planning capability into an efficient student model via agent tuning. Finally, during strategy execution, the student model adopts a proactive correction mechanism, enabling it to propose, review, and optimize its own verification strategies before execution. We demonstrate through experiments on three challenging benchmarks that our LEAP-tuned model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LEAP\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7b56\u7565\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u4fee\u6b63\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6267\u884c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u6d4b\u5931\u8d25", "method": "\u5c06\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8c03\u4f18\u5c06\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u84b8\u998f\u5230\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4e3b\u52a8\u4fee\u6b63\u673a\u5236", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cLEAP\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "LEAP\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Our experimental observations reveal that the system initially exhibits periodic dynamics at the onset of reversals before transitioning to stochastic behavior as the ratio of Rayleigh number ($Ra$) to Hartmann number ($Ha$) increases. This transition is governed by the competition between buoyancy and Lorentz forces, with experimental data showing a linear scaling relationship between $Ra$ and $Ha$ at critical points.

Our safe pruning strategy integrates Taylor-based channel importance with gradient conflict penalty to keep important channels while removing redundant and conflicting channels. To mitigate performance degradation after pruning, we further design a task head-agnostic distillation method that transfers intermediate backbone and encoder features from a teacher to a student model as guidance. Experiments on the BDD100K dataset demonstrate that our compressed model achieves a 32.7% reduction in parameters while segmentation performance shows negligible accuracy loss and only a minor decrease in detection (-1.2% for Recall and -1.8% for mAP50) compared to the teacher.

Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) addresses this by optimizing for the worst-case risk within a neighborhood of the training distribution. However, conventional methods depend on a single, global robustness budget, which can lead to overly conservative models or a misallocation of robustness. We propose a variance-driven, adaptive, sample-level DRO (Var-DRO) framework that automatically identifies high-risk training samples and assigns a personalized robustness budget to each based on its online loss variance. Our formulation employs two-sided, KL-divergence-style bounds to constrain the ratio between adversarial and empirical weights for every sample. This results in a linear inner maximization problem over a convex polytope, which admits an efficient water-filling solution. To stabilize training, we introduce a warmup phase and a linear ramp schedule for the global cap on per-sample budgets, complemented by label smoothing for numerical robustness. Evaluated on CIFAR-10-C (corruptions), our method achieves the highest overall mean accuracy compared to ERM and KL-DRO.

However, the quality of these reasoning chains remains underexplored. We present a comprehensive empirical study examining the reasoning process and quality of thinking LLMs for code generation. We evaluate six state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs (DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI-o3-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking, Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and Qwen-QwQ) across 100 code generation tasks of varying difficulty from BigCodeBench. We quantify reasoning-chain structure through step counts and verbosity, conduct controlled step-budget adjustments, and perform a 21-participant human evaluation across three dimensions: efficiency, logical correctness, and completeness. Our step-count interventions reveal that targeted step increases can improve resolution rates for certain models/tasks, while modest reductions often preserve success on standard tasks, rarely on hard ones. Through systematic analysis, we develop a reasoning-problematic taxonomy, identifying completeness as the dominant failure mode. Task complexity significantly impacts reasoning quality; hard problems are substantially more prone to incompleteness than standard tasks. Our stability analysis demonstrates that thinking LLMs maintain consistent logical structures across computational effort levels and can self-correct previous errors.

Schmidt", "Nikolaus A. Adams"], "title": "Temperature transformation recovering the compressible law of the wall for turbulent channel flow", "comment": null, "summary": "Velocity and temperature distribution are both crucial for modeling compressible wall-bounded turbulent flows. The compressible law of the wall for velocity has been extensively examined through velocity transformations. However, the issue of a well-established temperature transformation remains open. We propose a new temperature transformation for compressible turbulent channel flow. Our approach is based on the analysis of momentum and energy balance equations in the overlap layer. It accounts for the influences of mixing length model, the work of the body force, and the turbulent kinetic energy transport. Two types of temperature transformations are obtained: Van Driest type (VD-type) and semi-local type (SL-type). The performance of these transformations is evaluated using data from direct numerical simulations and wall-resolved large eddy simulations of compressible turbulent channel flow. Both the VD-type and SL-type transformations apply to isothermal and adiabatic walls. The SL-type transformation provides better data collapse in the viscous sublayer and buffer layer, thereby recovering the temperature law of the wall. When a suitable mixing length model is applied, the SL-type transformation yields results that agree with the incompressible temperature profile or exhibit extended logarithmic behavior. Results from the present study highlight careful consideration of the turbulent kinetic energy transport term in different thermal boundary conditions.

Traditional rule-based methods lack robustness, while existing deep learning models suffer from poor generalization and low accuracy on complex fillets due to their generic design and inadequate training data. To address these issues, this paper proposes an end-to-end, data-driven framework specifically for fillet features. We first construct and release a large-scale, diverse benchmark dataset for fillet recognition to address the inadequacy of existing data. Based on it, we propose FilletRec, a lightweight graph neural network. The core innovation of this network is its use of pose-invariant intrinsic geometric features, such as curvature, enabling it to learn more fundamental geometric patterns and thereby achieve high-precision recognition of complex geometric topologies. Experiments show that FilletRec surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and generalization, while using only 0.2\\%-5.4\\% of the parameters of baseline models, demonstrating high model efficiency. Finally, the framework completes the automated workflow from recognition to simplification by integrating an effective geometric simplification algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8eCAD\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5706\u89d2\u7279\u5f81\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edcFilletRec\uff0c\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7531\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5706\u89d2\u4e0a\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f4e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u5706\u89d2\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5706\u89d2\u8bc6\u522b\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edcFilletRec\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u59ff\u6001\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u5185\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u66f2\u7387\uff09\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u672c\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u6709\u6548\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7b80\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "FilletRec\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b0.2%-5.4%\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u8bc6\u522b\u5230\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u95e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5185\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u5706\u89d2\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3aCAD\u6a21\u578b\u7684CAE\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Fuel distributors specifically require precise estimates to avoid inventory shortages or excesses. However, there is a lack of studies that analyze the jet fuel demand forecasting problem using machine learning models. Instead, many industry practitioners rely on deterministic or expertise-based models. In this research, we evaluate the performance of data-driven approaches using a substantial amount of data obtained from a major aviation fuel distributor in the Danish market. Our analysis compares the predictive capabilities of traditional time series models, Prophet, LSTM sequence-to-sequence neural networks, and hybrid models. A key challenge in developing these models is the required forecasting horizon, as fuel demand needs to be predicted for the next 30 days to optimize sourcing strategies. To ensure the reliability of the data-driven approaches and provide valuable insights to practitioners, we analyze three different datasets.

The members of the vocabulary can be built of code points or bytes. Using code points means that all members of the vocabulary are valid UTF-8 characters. However, it also requires thousands of initial members to achieve acceptable coverage of inputs. Beginning with bytes, on the contrary, avoids out-of-vocabulary errors with only 256 initial members of the vocabulary, but the members of the vocabulary and sequences of them are not guaranteed to be valid UTF-8. Sequences that are not valid UTF-8 break code that assumes its input to be valid UTF-8. Applications of language models must account for the breakage thereby introduced. In this paper, we formalize tokenization using monoid theory and prove that tokenizers whose vocabularies contain tokens that are ill-formed UTF-8 can always produce sequences that are ill-formed UTF-8. We demonstrate formally that attempting to incrementally convert tokens back to a string and interpret the results as UTF-8 gives different results than converting the whole sequence of tokens at once.

While previous research has quantified bias at the dataset level or manually identified spurious correlations between modalities and labels, these approaches lack meaningful insights at the sample level and struggle to scale to the vast amount of online information. In this paper, we investigate the design for automated recognition of modality bias at the sample level. Specifically, we propose three bias quantification methods based on theories/views of different levels of granularity: 1) a coarse-grained evaluation of modality benefit; 2) a medium-grained quantification of information flow; and 3) a fine-grained causality analysis. To verify the effectiveness, we conduct a human evaluation on two popular benchmarks. Experimental results reveal three interesting findings that provide potential direction toward future research: 1)~Ensembling multiple views is crucial for reliable automated analysis; 2)~Automated analysis is prone to detector-induced fluctuations; and 3)~Different views produce a higher agreement on modality-balanced samples but diverge on biased ones.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7c92\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u5dee\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u6837\u672c\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bef\u5bfc\u4fe1\u606f\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bef\u5bfc\u4fe1\u606f\u57fa\u51c6\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7ea7\u522b\u91cf\u5316\u504f\u5dee\u6216\u624b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u6001\u4e0e\u6807\u7b7e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4f2a\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6837\u672c\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u6d1e\u5bdf\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6d77\u91cf\u5728\u7ebf\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7c92\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u6548\u76ca\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b2\uff09\u4e2d\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u91cf\u5316\uff1b3\uff09\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\u3002\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6d41\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u89d2\u5bf9\u53ef\u9760\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b2\uff09\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u6ce2\u52a8\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b3\uff09\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89d2\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u8fbe\u6210\u66f4\u9ad8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u4ea7\u751f\u5206\u6b67\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u5dee\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

H. Clercx"], "title": "Gravity current propagating against constant and pulsating counter flows", "comment": "25 pages, 16 figures", "summary": "This paper describes the evolution of two-dimensional (2D) gravity currents that flow against a horizontally uniform laminar pulsating flow. We study the effect of opposing mean flow amplitude and the oscillatory velocity amplitude on the evolution of the gravity current, the emergence of instabilities due to shear at the interface of heavy and light fluid and unstable density stratification near the bottom wall, and the associated density redistributions. The velocity amplitudes and the oscillation frequency are reminiscent of tidal estuarine flows. This study revealed two key processes affecting the horizontal density transport of the heavy fluid, in addition to the buoyancy-driven propagation of the gravity current. The first process concerns the presence of shear-driven Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) billows, depending on the strength of the opposing mean flow and the thickness of the gravity current. These KH billows are generated in the inertial phase of gravity current propagation and are responsible for coherent advective transport of heavy-fluid patches away from the gravity current head. The second process is related to the lifting of the gravity current head due to differential advection near the bottom wall when the propagation direction of the gravity current and the oscillating externally imposed flow are in the same direction. It generates a layer of light fluid below the heavy fluid of the gravity current head and becomes unstable when the ambient flow opposes the gravity current propagation, generating Rayleigh-Taylor-like (RT-like) instabilities. This results in a strong vertical redistribution of light and heavy fluid. Non-hydrostatic effects, such as the presence of KH billows and RT-like instabilities, with associated vertical density transport, have significant implications for large-scale horizontal density transport and modeling of salt intrusions in rivers and estuaries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e8c\u7ef4\u91cd\u529b\u6d41\u5728\u6c34\u5e73\u5747\u5300\u5c42\u6d41\u8109\u52a8\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u53cd\u5411\u5e73\u5747\u6d41\u632f\u5e45\u548c\u632f\u8361\u901f\u5ea6\u632f\u5e45\u5bf9\u91cd\u529b\u6d41\u6f14\u5316\u3001\u754c\u9762\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u91cd\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u526a\u5207\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5f00\u5c14\u6587-\u4ea5\u59c6\u970d\u5179\u6da1\u65cb\u548c\u7c7b\u745e\u5229-\u6cf0\u52d2\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8f93\u8fd0\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6f6e\u6c50\u6cb3\u53e3\u6d41\u52a8\u4e2d\u91cd\u529b\u6d41\u4e0e\u8109\u52a8\u6d41\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u526a\u5207\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5206\u5c42\u5bf9\u6c34\u5e73\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8f93\u8fd0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u6cb3\u6d41\u548c\u6cb3\u53e3\u76d0\u5165\u4fb5\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u4e8c\u7ef4\u91cd\u529b\u6d41\u5728\u6c34\u5e73\u5747\u5300\u5c42\u6d41\u8109\u52a8\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u53cd\u5411\u5e73\u5747\u6d41\u632f\u5e45\u3001\u632f\u8361\u901f\u5ea6\u632f\u5e45\u548c\u9891\u7387\u5bf9\u91cd\u529b\u6d41\u4f20\u64ad\u3001\u754c\u9762\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u91cd\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5f71\u54cd\u91cd\u6d41\u4f53\u6c34\u5e73\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8f93\u8fd0\uff1a\u526a\u5207\u9a71\u52a8\u7684KH\u6da1\u65cb\u5728\u91cd\u529b\u6d41\u60ef\u6027\u9636\u6bb5\u4ea7\u751f\u76f8\u5e72\u5e73\u6d41\u8f93\u8fd0\uff1b\u91cd\u529b\u6d41\u5934\u90e8\u62ac\u5347\u4ea7\u751f\u7c7bRT\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f3a\u70c8\u5782\u5411\u5bc6\u5ea6\u91cd\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "conclusion": "\u975e\u9759\u529b\u6548\u5e94\uff08KH\u6da1\u65cb\u548c\u7c7bRT\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5782\u5411\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8f93\u8fd0\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6c34\u5e73\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8f93\u8fd0\u548c\u6cb3\u53e3\u76d0\u5165\u4fb5\u5efa\u6a21\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

As video content becomes increasingly complex with diverse behavioral patterns and contextual scenarios, traditional VAD approaches struggle to provide robust assessment for modern surveillance systems. Existing methods either lack comprehensive spatial-temporal modeling or require excessive computational resources for real-time applications. In this regard, we present a Mamba-based multi-scale spatial-temporal learning (M2S2L) framework in this paper. The proposed method employs hierarchical spatial encoders operating at multiple granularities and multi-temporal encoders capturing motion dynamics across different time scales. We also introduce a feature decomposition mechanism to enable task-specific optimization for appearance and motion reconstruction, facilitating more nuanced behavioral modeling and quality-aware anomaly assessment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that M2S2L framework achieves 98.5%, 92.1%, and 77.9% frame-level AUCs on UCSD Ped2, CUHK Avenue, and ShanghaiTech respectively, while maintaining efficiency with 20.1G FLOPs and 45 FPS inference speed, making it suitable for practical surveillance deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eMamba\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65f6\u7a7a\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6M2S2L\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u9700\u8981\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u9762\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u8fc7\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5904\u7406\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u89e3\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523098.5%\u300192.1%\u548c77.9%\u7684\u5e27\u7ea7AUC\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e3a20.1G FLOPs\u548c45 FPS\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "M2S2L\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u76d1\u63a7\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

In this work, we tackle this challenge by addressing the inverse problem of simultaneously recovering the potential function and interaction kernel from discretized observations of the density flow. We formulate the problem as an optimization task that minimizes a loss function specifically designed to enforce the underlying variational structure of Wasserstein flows, ensuring consistency with the geometric properties of the density manifold.

We propose Base-Aligned Model Collaboration (BACo), an inference-time token-level model collaboration framework that dynamically combines a base LLM with its aligned counterpart to optimize diversity and quality. Inspired by prior work (Fei et al., 2025), BACo employs routing strategies that determine, at each token, from which model to decode based on next-token prediction uncertainty and predicted contents' semantic role. Prior diversity-promoting methods, such as retraining, prompt engineering, and multi-sampling methods, improve diversity but often degrade quality or require costly decoding or post-training. In contrast, BACo achieves both high diversity and quality post hoc within a single pass, while offering strong controllability.

As a result, their performance remains bounded by the initial framework design and the underlying LLM's capabilities. We propose Self-Abstraction from Grounded Experience (SAGE), a framework that enables agents to learn from their own task executions and refine their behavior through self-abstraction. After an initial rollout, the agent induces a concise plan abstraction from its grounded experience, distilling key steps, dependencies, and constraints. This learned abstraction is then fed back as contextual guidance, refining the agent's policy and supporting more structured, informed subsequent executions. Empirically, SAGE delivers consistent performance gains across diverse LLM backbones and agent architectures. Notably, it yields a 7.2% relative performance improvement over the strong Mini-SWE-Agent baseline when paired with the GPT-5 (high) backbone.

The proposed model is based on the force distribution exerted by a lift-generating wing on the surrounding fluid. It distinguishes between turbulent and nominal components of the force distribution, with the nominal force distribution modeled to peak at the wing and decay linearly into the free stream. This separation allows the turbulent component to be represented by a transport equation that is influenced by flight conditions, specifically dynamic pressure and angle of attack. Consequently, the Navier-Stokes equations, along with the turbulence transport equation, can be transformed into a reduced-order model characterized by three scalar ordinary differential equations - similar to the Lorenz attractor. This resulting system effectively captures chaotic behavior, facilitating the exploration of complex dynamics without the computational demands of solving the full Navier-Stokes equations. A simulation trade study is conducted that models wing rock phenomena at high angles of attack, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach in capturing the intricate dynamics of unsteady aircraft aerodynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u98de\u673a\u975e\u5b9a\u5e38\u6c14\u6d41\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u5206\u4e3a\u6e4d\u6d41\u548c\u540d\u4e49\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u4e09\u6807\u91cf\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6355\u6349\u6df7\u6c8c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u62df\u9ad8\u653b\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u673a\u7ffc\u6447\u6eda\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfNavier-Stokes\u65b9\u7a0b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u7a7a\u6c14\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5347\u529b\u673a\u7ffc\u5bf9\u5468\u56f4\u6d41\u4f53\u65bd\u52a0\u7684\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u5206\u79bb\u4e3a\u6e4d\u6d41\u548c\u540d\u4e49\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u540d\u4e49\u5206\u91cf\u5728\u673a\u7ffc\u5904\u8fbe\u5230\u5cf0\u503c\u5e76\u5411\u81ea\u7531\u6d41\u7ebf\u6027\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u6e4d\u6d41\u5206\u91cf\u7528\u53d7\u98de\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u8f93\u8fd0\u65b9\u7a0b\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u7684\u4e09\u6807\u91cf\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u6df7\u6c8c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u62df\u9ad8\u653b\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u673a\u7ffc\u6447\u6eda\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u590d\u6742\u975e\u5b9a\u5e38\u7a7a\u6c14\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u98de\u673a\u975e\u5b9a\u5e38\u6c14\u6d41\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u4e14\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u6c42\u89e3\u5b8c\u6574Navier-Stokes\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002"}}

In this paper, we investigate how in-context learning enables state-of-the-art VLMs to perform few-shot object detection when large annotated datasets are unavailable, as is often the case with microscopic images. We introduce the Micro-OD benchmark, a curated collection of 252 images specifically curated for in-context learning, with bounding-box annotations spanning 11 cell types across four sources, including two in-lab expert-annotated sets. We systematically evaluate eight VLMs under few-shot conditions and compare variants with and without implicit test-time reasoning tokens. We further implement a hybrid Few-Shot Object Detection (FSOD) pipeline that combines a detection head with a VLM-based few-shot classifier, which enhances the few-shot performance of recent VLMs on our benchmark. Across datasets, we observe that zero-shot performance is weak due to the domain gap; however, few-shot support consistently improves detection, with marginal gains achieved after six shots. We observe that models with reasoning tokens are more effective for end-to-end localization, whereas simpler variants are more suitable for classifying pre-localized crops.

Building on DAUM, we further apply knowledge distillation to reduce the computational overhead of uncertainty modeling, while largely preserving predictive accuracy and retaining the benefits of uncertainty estimation. Experiments on the JD advertisement dataset demonstrate that DAUM consistently improves predictive performance, with the distilled model delivering a tenfold increase in inference speed.", "AI": {"tldr": "DAUM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5b9e\u65f6\u7ade\u4ef7\u62e6\u622a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5b9e\u73b010\u500d\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u65f6\u7ade\u4ef7\u62e6\u622a\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u6d41\u91cf\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff08\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u6548\u7387\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDAUM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u6765\u540c\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u6d41\u91cf\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5e94\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5728JD\u5e7f\u544a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDAUM\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u84b8\u998f\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b010\u500d\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "DAUM\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u7ade\u4ef7\u62e6\u622a\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

To address this need, Online Continual Learning (OCL) mechanisms have been proposed, allowing models to update their knowledge incrementally as new data become available while preserving previously acquired information. However, existing OCL approaches for sensor-based HAR are computationally intensive and require extensive labeled samples to represent new changes. Recently, pre-trained model-based (PTM-based) OCL approaches have shown significant improvements in performance and efficiency for computer vision applications. These methods achieve strong generalization capabilities by pre-training complex models on large datasets, followed by fine-tuning on downstream tasks for continual learning. However, applying PTM-based OCL approaches to sensor-based HAR poses significant challenges due to the inherent heterogeneity of HAR datasets and the scarcity of labeled data in post-deployment scenarios. This paper introduces PTRN-HAR, the first successful application of PTM-based OCL to sensor-based HAR. Unlike prior PTM-based OCL approaches, PTRN-HAR pre-trains the feature extractor using contrastive loss with a limited amount of data. This extractor is then frozen during the streaming stage. Furthermore, it replaces the conventional dense classification layer with a relation module network. Our design not only significantly reduces the resource consumption required for model training while maintaining high performance, but also improves data efficiency by reducing the amount of labeled data needed for effective continual learning, as demonstrated through experiments on three public datasets, outperforming the state-of-the-art.

Deep neural kernels provide a principled framework to interpret over-parameterized neural networks by mapping hierarchical feature transformations into kernel spaces, thereby combining the expressive power of deep architectures with the analytical tractability of kernel methods. Recent advances, particularly neural tangent kernels (NTKs) derived by gradient inner products, have established connections between infinitely wide neural networks and nonparametric Bayesian inference. However, the existing NTK paradigm has been predominantly confined to the infinite-width regime, while overlooking the representational role of network depth. To address this gap, we propose a depth-induced NTK kernel based on a shortcut-related architecture, which converges to a Gaussian process as the network depth approaches infinity. We theoretically analyze the training invariance and spectrum properties of the proposed kernel, which stabilizes the kernel dynamics and mitigates degeneration. Experimental results further underscore the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our findings significantly extend the existing landscape of the neural kernel theory and provide an in-depth understanding of deep learning and the scaling law.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5feb\u6377\u8fde\u63a5\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bf1\u5bfcNTK\u6838\uff0c\u8be5\u6838\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u6df1\u5ea6\u8d8b\u4e8e\u65e0\u7a77\u65f6\u6536\u655b\u5230\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u8c31\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684NTK\u8303\u5f0f\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u65e0\u9650\u5bbd\u5ea6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u8868\u793a\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5feb\u6377\u8fde\u63a5\u67b6\u6784\u6784\u5efa\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bf1\u5bfcNTK\u6838\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u8c31\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6838\u52a8\u6001\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bf1\u5bfcNTK\u6838\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u8d8b\u4e8e\u65e0\u7a77\u65f6\u6536\u655b\u5230\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u8457\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u6838\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u683c\u5c40\uff0c\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

As models develop induction heads, they often experience a sharp drop in training loss, a phenomenon cited as evidence that induction heads may serve as a prerequisite for more complex in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. In this work, we ask whether transformers can still acquire ICL capabilities when inductive copying is suppressed. We propose Hapax, a setting where we omit the loss contribution of any token that can be correctly predicted by induction heads. Despite a significant reduction in inductive copying, performance on abstractive ICL tasks (i.e., tasks where the answer is not contained in the input context) remains comparable and surpasses the vanilla model on 13 of 21 tasks, even though 31.7\\% of tokens are omitted from the loss. Furthermore, our model achieves lower loss values on token positions that cannot be predicted correctly by induction heads. Mechanistic analysis further shows that models trained with Hapax develop fewer and weaker induction heads but still preserve ICL capabilities. Taken together, our findings indicate that inductive copying is not essential for learning abstractive ICL mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Hapax\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6291\u5236\u5f52\u7eb3\u590d\u5236\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3Transformer\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u51cf\u5c11\u5f52\u7eb3\u590d\u5236\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u62bd\u8c61ICL\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4ecd\u7136\u4fdd\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5f52\u7eb3\u590d\u5236\u5e76\u975e\u62bd\u8c61ICL\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5f53\u6291\u5236\u5f52\u7eb3\u590d\u5236\u65f6\uff0cTransformer\u662f\u5426\u4ecd\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5f52\u7eb3\u590d\u5236\u662f\u5426\u662f\u590d\u6742ICL\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5148\u51b3\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHapax\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5ffd\u7565\u80fd\u88ab\u5f52\u7eb3\u5934\u6b63\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684token\u7684\u635f\u5931\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6291\u5236\u5f52\u7eb3\u590d\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5c3d\u7ba131.7%\u7684token\u88ab\u5ffd\u7565\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u572821\u4e2a\u62bd\u8c61ICL\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u768413\u4e2a\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u88ab\u5f52\u7eb3\u5934\u6b63\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0a\u635f\u5931\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f52\u7eb3\u590d\u5236\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u62bd\u8c61ICL\u673a\u5236\u5e76\u975e\u5fc5\u9700\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u4ed6\u673a\u5236\u83b7\u5f97ICL\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

The neuron generation-annihilation algorithm in RBM and layer generation algorithm in DBN make an optimal network structure for given input during the learning. In this paper, our model is applied to an automatic recognition method of road network system, called RoadTracer. RoadTracer can generate a road map on the ground surface from aerial photograph data. A novel method of RoadTracer using the Teacher-Student based ensemble learning model of Adaptive DBN is proposed, since the road maps contain many complicated features so that a model with high representation power to detect should be required. The experimental results showed the detection accuracy of the proposed model was improved from 40.0\\% to 89.0\\% on average in the seven major cities among the test dataset. In addition, we challenged to apply our method to the detection of available roads when landslide by natural disaster is occurred, in order to rapidly obtain a way of transportation.

However, if the equation does not meet the user's expectations, there are few options for getting other equation suggestions without intensive work with the system. To fill this gap, we propose Residuals for Equation Discovery (RED), a post-processing method that improves a given equation in a targeted manner, based on its residuals. By parsing the initial equation to a syntax tree, we can use node-based calculation rules to compute the residual for each subequation of the initial equation. It is then possible to use this residual as new target variable in the original data set and generate a new prompt. If, with the new prompt, the equation discovery system suggests a subequation better than the old subequation on a validation set, we replace the latter by the former. RED is usable with any equation discovery system, is fast to calculate, and is easy to extend for new mathematical operations.

First, the large language model captures contextual dependencies and deep semantic representations of the input text, providing a rich feature foundation for subsequent modeling. Then, based on multi-level feature representations, the feature pyramid mechanism effectively integrates semantic features of different scales, balancing global information and local details to construct hierarchical semantic expressions. Furthermore, the fused features are transformed into graph representations, and graph neural networks are employed to capture latent semantic relations and logical dependencies in the text, enabling comprehensive modeling of complex interactions among semantic units. On this basis, the readout and classification modules generate the final category predictions. The proposed method demonstrates significant advantages in robustness alignment experiments, outperforming existing models on ACC, F1-Score, AUC, and Precision, which verifies the effectiveness and stability of the framework.

Street View Imagery (SVI) and Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) represent two prominent approaches for capturing place-based perceptions that can support urban planning decisions, yet their comparability remains underexplored. This study investigates the alignment between SVI-based perceived attractiveness and residents' reported experiences gathered via a city-wide PPGIS survey in Helsinki, Finland. Using participant-rated SVI data and semantic image segmentation, we trained a machine learning model to predict perceived attractiveness based on visual features. We compared these predictions to PPGIS-identified locations marked as attractive or unattractive, calculating agreement using two sets of strict and moderate criteria. Our findings reveal only partial alignment between the two datasets. While agreement (with a moderate threshold) reached 67% for attractive and 77% for unattractive places, agreement (with a strict threshold) dropped to 27% and 29%, respectively. By analysing a range of contextual variables, including noise, traffic, population presence, and land use, we found that non-visual cues significantly contributed to mismatches. The model failed to account for experiential dimensions such as activity levels and environmental stressors that shape perceptions but are not visible in images. These results suggest that while SVI offers a scalable and visual proxy for urban perception, it cannot fully substitute the experiential richness captured through PPGIS. We argue that both methods are valuable but serve different purposes; therefore, a more integrated approach is needed to holistically capture how people perceive urban environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u8857\u666f\u56fe\u50cf(SVI)\u548c\u516c\u4f17\u53c2\u4e0eGIS(PPGIS)\u5728\u6355\u6349\u57ce\u5e02\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u8005\u53ea\u6709\u90e8\u5206\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u975e\u89c6\u89c9\u56e0\u7d20\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u611f\u77e5\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6570\u5b57\u5de5\u5177\u65e5\u76ca\u5f71\u54cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u89c4\u5212\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u5982\u4f55\u53cd\u6620\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002SVI\u548cPPGIS\u662f\u4e24\u79cd\u6355\u6349\u57fa\u4e8e\u5730\u70b9\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8bc4\u5206\u7684SVI\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u9884\u6d4b\u611f\u77e5\u5438\u5f15\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0ePPGIS\u8c03\u67e5\u4e2d\u6807\u8bb0\u4e3a\u6709\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u6216\u65e0\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ec5\u90e8\u5206\u4e00\u81f4\uff1a\u4e2d\u7b49\u9608\u503c\u4e0b\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u5730\u70b9\u4e00\u81f4\u602767%\uff0c\u65e0\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u5730\u70b977%\uff1b\u4e25\u683c\u9608\u503c\u4e0b\u5206\u522b\u964d\u81f327%\u548c29%\u3002\u975e\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u5982\u566a\u97f3\u3001\u4ea4\u901a\u3001\u4eba\u53e3\u5b58\u5728\u548c\u571f\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u663e\u8457\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "SVI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u66ff\u4ee3PPGIS\u6355\u6349\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u4f46\u670d\u52a1\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u76ee\u7684\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7efc\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5168\u9762\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u3002"}}

Most existing RL systems for LLMs operate in a fully synchronous manner, where training must wait for the rollout of an entire batch to complete. This design leads to severe inefficiencies, as extremely long trajectories can stall the entire rollout process and leave many GPUs idle. To address this issue, we propose Concurrency- Controlled Partial Rollout with Importance Sampling (CoPRIS), which mitigates long-tail inefficiencies by maintaining a fixed number of concurrent rollouts, early-terminating once sufficient samples are collected, and reusing unfinished trajectories in subsequent rollouts. To mitigate the impact of off-policy trajectories, we introduce Cross-stage Importance Sampling Correction, which concatenates buffered log probabilities from the previous policy with those recomputed under the current policy for importance sampling correction. Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that CoPRIS achieves up to 1.94x faster training while maintaining comparable or superior performance to synchronous RL systems.

However, their success hinges on navigating a fundamental cognitive tension: the need to balance broad, divergent exploration of the solution space with a principled, convergent synthesis to the optimal solution. Existing paradigms often struggle to manage this duality, leading to premature consensus, error propagation, and a critical credit assignment problem that fails to distinguish between genuine reasoning and superficially plausible arguments. To resolve this core challenge, we propose the Multi-Agent Exploration-Synthesis framework Through Role Orchestration (Maestro), a principled paradigm for collaboration that structurally decouples these cognitive modes. Maestro uses a collective of parallel Execution Agents for diverse exploration and a specialized Central Agent for convergent, evaluative synthesis. To operationalize this critical synthesis phase, we introduce Conditional Listwise Policy Optimization (CLPO), a reinforcement learning objective that disentangles signals for strategic decisions and tactical rationales. By combining decision-focused policy gradients with a list-wise ranking loss over justifications, CLPO achieves clean credit assignment and stronger comparative supervision. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and general problem-solving benchmarks demonstrate that Maestro, coupled with CLPO, consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art multi-agent approaches, delivering absolute accuracy gains of 6% on average and up to 10% at best.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Maestro\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89d2\u8272\u7f16\u6392\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u5f20\u529b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CLPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u6536\u655b\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u8fc7\u65e9\u5171\u8bc6\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u771f\u6b63\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u8868\u9762\u5408\u7406\u7684\u8bba\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "Maestro\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89e3\u8026\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\uff1a\u5e76\u884c\u6267\u884c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8d1f\u8d23\u591a\u6837\u5316\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u4e2d\u592e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8d1f\u8d23\u6536\u655b\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5408\u6210\u3002\u5f15\u5165CLPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u51b3\u7b56\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7406\u7531\u7684\u5217\u8868\u6392\u5e8f\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u901a\u7528\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMaestro+CLPO\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53476%\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534710%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89e3\u8026\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CLPO\u7684\u6e05\u6d01\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\uff0cMaestro\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u8ba4\u77e5\u5f20\u529b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, current ST platforms frequently suffer from low resolution, limiting the in-depth understanding of spatial gene expression. Super-resolution approaches promise to enhance ST maps by integrating histology images with gene expressions of profiled tissue spots. However, it remains a challenge to model the interactions between histology images and gene expressions for effective ST enhancement. This study presents a cross-modal cross-content contrastive diffusion framework, called C3-Diff, for ST enhancement with histology images as guidance. In C3-Diff, we firstly analyze the deficiency of traditional contrastive learning paradigm, which is then refined to extract both modal-invariant and content-invariant features of ST maps and histology images. Further, to overcome the problem of low sequencing sensitivity in ST maps, we perform nosing-based information augmentation on the surface of feature unit hypersphere. Finally, we propose a dynamic cross-modal imputation-based training strategy to mitigate ST data scarcity. We tested C3-Diff by benchmarking its performance on four public datasets, where it achieves significant improvements over competing methods. Moreover, we evaluate C3-Diff on downstream tasks of cell type localization, gene expression correlation and single-cell-level gene expression prediction, promoting AI-enhanced biotechnology for biomedical research and clinical applications.

However, FL suffers from significant communication overhead due to the frequent exchange of high-dimensional model updates over constrained networks. In this paper, we present FedSparQ, a lightweight compression framework that dynamically sparsifies the gradient of each client through an adaptive threshold, applies half-precision quantization to retained entries and integrates residuals from error feedback to prevent loss of information. FedSparQ requires no manual tuning of sparsity rates or quantization schedules, adapts seamlessly to both homogeneous and heterogeneous data distributions, and is agnostic to model architecture. Through extensive empirical evaluation on vision benchmarks under independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID data, we show that FedSparQ substantially reduces communication overhead (reducing by 90% of bytes sent compared to FedAvg) while preserving or improving model accuracy (improving by 6% compared to FedAvg non-compressed solution or to state-of-the-art compression models) and enhancing convergence robustness (by 50%, compared to the other baselines).

NMF is a difficult problem in general (NP-hard), and its solutions are typically not unique. To address these two issues, additional constraints or assumptions are often used. In particular, separability assumes that the basis vectors in the NMF are equal to some columns of the input matrix. In that case, the problem is referred to as separable NMF (SNMF) and can be solved in polynomial-time with robustness guarantees, while identifying a unique solution. However, in real-world scenarios, due to noise or variability, multiple data points may lie near the basis vectors, which SNMF does not leverage. In this work, we rely on the smooth separability assumption, which assumes that each basis vector is close to multiple data points. We explore the properties of the corresponding problem, referred to as smooth SNMF (SSNMF), and examine how it relates to SNMF and orthogonal NMF. We then propose a convex model for SSNMF and show that it provably recovers the sought-after factors, even in the presence of noise.

Most existing approaches rely on fine-tuning to balance unlearning efficiency with general language capabilities. However, these methods typically require training or access to retain data, which is often unavailable in real world scenarios. Although these methods can perform well when both forget and retain data are available, few works have demonstrated equivalent capability in more practical, data-limited scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Detect-Reasoning Augmented GeneratiON (DRAGON), a systematic, reasoning-based framework that utilizes in-context chain-of-thought (CoT) instructions to guard deployed LLMs before inference. Instead of modifying the base model, DRAGON leverages the inherent instruction-following ability of LLMs and introduces a lightweight detection module to identify forget-worthy prompts without any retain data.

We hypothesize that explicitly disentangled object-level representations, by localizing task-relevant information, can enhance policy performance across novel feature combinations. To test this hypothesis, we introduce DLPWM, a fully unsupervised, disentangled object-centric world model that learns object-level latents directly from pixels. DLPWM achieves strong reconstruction and prediction performance, including robustness to several out-of-distribution (OOD) visual variations. However, when used for downstream model-based control, policies trained on DLPWM latents underperform compared to DreamerV3. Through latent-trajectory analyses, we identify representation shift during multi-object interactions as a key driver of unstable policy learning.

However, existing GFMs struggle with unstable few-shot fine-tuning, where both performance and adaptation efficiency exhibit significant fluctuations caused by the randomness in the support sample selection and structural discrepancies between the pre-trained and target graphs. How to fine-tune GFMs robustly and efficiently to enable trustworthy knowledge transfer across domains and tasks is the major challenge. In this paper, we propose GRAVER, a novel Generative gRAph VocabulariEs for Robust GFM fine-tuning framework that tackles the aforementioned instability via generative augmentations. Specifically, to identify transferable units, we analyze and extract key class-specific subgraph patterns by ego-graph disentanglement and validate their transferability both theoretically and empirically. To enable effective pre-training across diverse domains, we leverage a universal task template based on ego-graph similarity and construct graph vocabularies via graphon-based generative experts. To facilitate robust and efficient prompt fine-tuning, we grave the support samples with in-context vocabularies, where the lightweight MoE-CoE network attentively routes knowledge from source domains.

Meanwhile, fine-tuning remains the default operation for adapting LLMs to new domains and tasks. Despite their widespread adoption, these two post-training interventions have been studied in isolation, leaving open a crucial question: if we fine-tune an edited model, do the edits survive? This question is motivated by two practical scenarios: removing covert or malicious edits, and preserving beneficial edits. If fine-tuning impairs edits as shown in Figure 1, current KE methods become less useful, as every fine-tuned model would require re-editing, which significantly increases the cost; if edits persist, fine-tuned models risk propagating hidden malicious edits, raising serious safety concerns. To this end, we systematically quantify edits decay after fine-tuning, investigating how fine-tuning affects knowledge editing. We evaluate two state-of-the-art editing methods (MEMIT, AlphaEdit) and three fine-tuning approaches (full-parameter, LoRA, DoRA) across five LLMs and three datasets, yielding 232 experimental configurations. Our results show that edits decay after fine-tuning, with survival varying across configurations, e.g., AlphaEdit edits decay more than MEMIT edits. Further, we propose selective-layer fine-tuning and find that fine-tuning edited layers only can effectively remove edits, though at a slight cost to downstream performance. Surprisingly, fine-tuning non-edited layers impairs more edits than full fine-tuning. Overall, our study establishes empirical baselines and actionable strategies for integrating knowledge editing with fine-tuning, and underscores that evaluating model editing requires considering the full LLM application pipeline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u7f16\u8f91\u5185\u5bb9\u4f1a\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u751f\u5b58\u7387\u56e0\u914d\u7f6e\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5c42\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u6709\u6548\u79fb\u9664\u6216\u4fdd\u7559\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u4e24\u79cd\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u7f16\u8f91\u5185\u5bb9\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u7559\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u79fb\u9664\u6076\u610f\u7f16\u8f91\u6216\u4fdd\u7559\u6709\u76ca\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e24\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08MEMIT\u3001AlphaEdit\uff09\u548c\u4e09\u79cd\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u3001LoRA\u3001DoRA\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4e94\u4e2aLLM\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c232\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5c42\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u7f16\u8f91\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u4f1a\u8870\u51cf\uff0cAlphaEdit\u7f16\u8f91\u6bd4MEMIT\u7f16\u8f91\u8870\u51cf\u66f4\u591a\uff1b\u4ec5\u5fae\u8c03\u7f16\u8f91\u5c42\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u79fb\u9664\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u8f7b\u5fae\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u4ec5\u5fae\u8c03\u975e\u7f16\u8f91\u5c42\u6bd4\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u635f\u5bb3\u66f4\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6574\u5408\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7ecf\u9a8c\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u5b8c\u6574\u7684LLM\u5e94\u7528\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002"}}

However, for multi-agent planning, MCTS is confronted with a large combinatorial action space that often grows exponentially with the number of agents. As a result, the branching factor of MCTS during tree expansion also increases exponentially, making it very difficult to efficiently explore and exploit during tree search. To this end, we propose MALinZero, a new approach to leverage low-dimensional representational structures on joint-action returns and enable efficient MCTS in complex multi-agent planning. Our solution can be viewed as projecting the joint-action returns into the low-dimensional space representable using a contextual linear bandit problem formulation. We solve the contextual linear bandit problem with convex and $\u03bc$-smooth loss functions -- in order to place more importance on better joint actions and mitigate potential representational limitations -- and derive a linear Upper Confidence Bound applied to trees (LinUCT) to enable novel multi-agent exploration and exploitation in the low-dimensional space. We analyze the regret of MALinZero for low-dimensional reward functions and propose an $(1-\\tfrac1e)$-approximation algorithm for the joint action selection by maximizing a sub-modular objective.

Both methods rely on projecting local gradients onto a shared client-server subspace spanned by historical descent directions, enabling efficient information exchange with minimal communication overhead.

When these power series are truncated one obtains Hermite interpolation polynomials. In this paper we first review different approaches to obtain multicentric representations with emphasis in piecewise constant holomorphic functions. When the polynomial is of degree $d$ and all power series are truncated after $n^{th}$ power, we formally arrive into a Hermite interpolation polynomial of degree $d(n+1)-1$. The natural way to represent Hermite interpolation is to have for each interpolation condition a basis polynomial which in this case leads to $d(n+1)$ basis polynomials. We then consider the numerical accumulation of errors in the different ways to represent and evaluate the Hermite interpolation. In the multicentric representation due to the convergence of the power series, numerical errors stay bounded as $n$ grows. When we assume that the piecewise constant holomorphic function takes the value $1$ in one of the components and vanishes in the other so that the Hermite interpolation agrees with just one basis polynomial, even then the truncated multicentric representation is favorable. In the general case one would take a linear combination of all $d(n+1)$ basis polynomials.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u6bb5\u5168\u7eaf\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u63d2\u503c\u548c\u591a\u9879\u5f0fp\u7684\u5e42\u7ea7\u6570\u5c55\u5f00\uff0c\u5f97\u5230Hermite\u63d2\u503c\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u503c\u8bef\u5dee\u79ef\u7d2f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u6bb5\u5168\u7eaf\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u63d2\u503c\u548c\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u5e42\u7ea7\u6570\u5c55\u5f00\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8Hermite\u63d2\u503c\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6570\u503c\u8bef\u5dee\u79ef\u7d2f\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u63d2\u503c\u4e0e\u591a\u9879\u5f0fp\u7684\u6536\u655b\u5e42\u7ea7\u6570\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u622a\u65ad\u5e42\u7ea7\u6570\u5f97\u5230Hermite\u63d2\u503c\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u793a\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30Hermite\u63d2\u503c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u503c\u8bef\u5dee\u79ef\u7d2f\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\u7531\u4e8e\u5e42\u7ea7\u6570\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u8bef\u5dee\u968f\u7740n\u7684\u589e\u957f\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u754c\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5206\u6bb5\u5e38\u6570\u5168\u7eaf\u51fd\u6570\u4ec5\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u91cf\u53d6\u503c\u4e3a1\u3001\u5176\u4ed6\u5206\u91cf\u4e3a0\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u622a\u65ad\u7684\u591a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\u4e5f\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\u5728Hermite\u63d2\u503c\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5206\u6bb5\u5168\u7eaf\u51fd\u6570\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63a7\u5236\u6570\u503c\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u79ef\u7d2f\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this context, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated value; however, inherent limitations remain. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technologies show potential to enhance their clinical applicability. This study reviewed RAG applications in medicine. We found that research primarily relied on publicly available data, with limited application in private data. For retrieval, approaches commonly relied on English-centric embedding models, while LLMs were mostly generic, with limited use of medical-specific LLMs. For evaluation, automated metrics evaluated generation quality and task performance, whereas human evaluation focused on accuracy, completeness, relevance, and fluency, with insufficient attention to bias and safety.

PRIME includes stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, and neutral puzzle variants generated from a shared puzzle structure, allowing for controlled and fine-grained comparisons. We evaluate multiple model families across puzzle sizes and test the effectiveness of prompt-based mitigation strategies.

However, even state-of-the-art models often suffer from fine-grained artifacts and poor identity preservation, particularly under challenging poses and expressions. A key limitation of existing approaches is their failure to meaningfully leverage 3D facial structure, which is crucial for disentangling identity from pose and expression. In this work, we propose DiffSwap++, a novel diffusion-based face-swapping pipeline that incorporates 3D facial latent features during training. By guiding the generation process with 3D-aware representations, our method enhances geometric consistency and improves the disentanglement of facial identity from appearance attributes. We further design a diffusion architecture that conditions the denoising process on both identity embeddings and facial landmarks, enabling high-fidelity and identity-preserving face swaps. Extensive experiments on CelebA, FFHQ, and CelebV-Text demonstrate that DiffSwap++ outperforms prior methods in preserving source identity while maintaining target pose and expression. Additionally, we introduce a biometric-style evaluation and conduct a user study to further validate the realism and effectiveness of our approach.

Specifically, the proposed framework innovatively combines the powerful frequency-domain representation capability of FNOs to capture high-dimensional temporal patterns; DAEs to achieve robust, noise-resistant latent state embedding from complex non-Gaussian sensor data; and GNNs to accurately represent inter-device dependencies for coordinated system-wide maintenance decisions. Furthermore, by exploiting PPO, the framework ensures stable and efficient optimisation of long-term maintenance strategies to effectively handle uncertainty and non-stationary dynamics. Experimental validation demonstrates that the approach significantly outperforms multiple deep learning baseline models with up to 13% cost reduction, as well as strong convergence and inter-module synergy.

Our approach relies on local histopolation methods defined through unisolvent triples, where the edge weights are induced by suitable probability densities. In particular, we introduce two new two-parameter families of generalized truncated normal distributions, which extend classical exponential-type laws and provide additional flexibility in capturing local features of the target function. These distributions give rise to new quadratic reconstruction operators that generalize the standard linear histopolation scheme, while retaining its simplicity and locality.

Existing works towards NID mainly adopt a cascaded architecture, wherein the first stage focuses on encoding the utterances into informative text embeddings beforehand, while the latter is to group similar embeddings into clusters (i.e., intents), typically by K-Means. However, such a cascaded pipeline fails to leverage the feedback from both steps for mutual refinement, and, meanwhile, the embedding-only clustering overlooks nuanced textual semantics, leading to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes NILC, a novel clustering framework specially catered for effective NID. Particularly, NILC follows an iterative workflow, in which clustering assignments are judiciously updated by carefully refining cluster centroids and text embeddings of uncertain utterances with the aid of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, NILC first taps into LLMs to create additional semantic centroids for clusters, thereby enriching the contextual semantics of the Euclidean centroids of embeddings. Moreover, LLMs are then harnessed to augment hard samples (ambiguous or terse utterances) identified from clusters via rewriting for subsequent cluster correction. Further, we inject supervision signals through non-trivial techniques seeding and soft must links for more accurate NID in the semi-supervised setting.

However, by relying on a final softmax classifier, these methods suffer from two fundamental distortions: additive logit shifts that arbitrarily bias importance scores, and sign collapse that conflates excitatory and inhibitory features. We propose a simple, architecture-agnostic dual-branch sigmoid head that decouples localization from classification. Given any pretrained model, we clone its classification head into a parallel branch ending in per-class sigmoid outputs, freeze the original softmax head, and fine-tune only the sigmoid branch with class-balanced binary supervision. At inference, softmax retains recognition accuracy, while class evidence maps are generated from the sigmoid branch -- preserving both magnitude and sign of feature contributions. Our method integrates seamlessly with most CAM variants and incurs negligible overhead. Extensive evaluations on fine-grained tasks (CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars) and WSOL benchmarks (ImageNet-1K, OpenImages30K) show improved explanation fidelity and consistent Top-1 Localization gains -- without any drop in classification accuracy.

We propose Spatio-Temporal Flow, a physics-inspired paradigm that explicitly models dynamic node couplings through quantifiable flow transfers governed by conservation principles. Building on this, we design FlowNet, a novel architecture leveraging flow tokens as information carriers to simulate source-to-destination transfers via Flow Allocation Modules, ensuring state redistribution aligns with conservation laws. FlowNet dynamically adjusts the interaction radius through an Adaptive Spatial Masking module, suppressing irrelevant noise while enabling context-aware propagation. A cascaded architecture enhances scalability and nonlinear representation capacity. Experiments demonstrate that FlowNet significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on seven metrics in the modeling of three real-world systems, validating its efficiency and physical interpretability. We establish a principled methodology for modeling complex systems through spatio-temporal flow interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Spatio-Temporal Flow\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u6d41\u8f6c\u79fb\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u52a8\u6001\u8282\u70b9\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86FlowNet\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u6216\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6d41\u4ea4\u6362\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6d41\u4ee4\u724c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u8f7d\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d41\u5206\u914d\u6a21\u5757\u6a21\u62df\u6e90\u5230\u76ee\u7684\u5730\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u72b6\u6001\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u7b26\u5408\u5b88\u6052\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a9\u7801\u6a21\u5757\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4ea4\u4e92\u534a\u5f84\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u7ea7\u8054\u67b6\u6784\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\uff0cFlowNet\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u7a7a\u6d41\u4ea4\u4e92\u5efa\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

The two methods are extended to logarithmic formulations providing sound and robust implementations in increasing state dimension. Comparing to the classical particle filters and ensemble Kalman filters, we benchmark the methods on numerous examples. In the low-dimensional examples the particle filters work well, but when we scale up to a partially observed 100-dimensional Lorenz-96 model the particle-based methods fail and the logarithmic deep density method prevails.

These agents possess a predefined set of skills or intents to fulfill specific user tasks. But every system has its own limitations. There are instances where, even for known intents, if any model exhibits low confidence, it results in rejection of utterances that necessitate manual annotation. Additionally, as time progresses, there may be a need to retrain these agents with new intents from the system-rejected queries to carry out additional tasks. Labeling all these emerging intents and rejected utterances over time is impractical, thus calling for an efficient mechanism to reduce annotation costs. In this paper, we introduce IDALC (Intent Detection and Active Learning based Correction), a semi-supervised framework designed to detect user intents and rectify system-rejected utterances while minimizing the need for human annotation. Empirical findings on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our system surpasses baseline methods, achieving a 5-10% higher accuracy and a 4-8% improvement in macro-F1. Remarkably, we maintain the overall annotation cost at just 6-10% of the unlabelled data available to the system.

Accurate role identification, which forms the basis of an agent's belief state, is therefore the keystone for both human and AI performance. We introduce CSP4SDG, a probabilistic, constraint-satisfaction framework that analyses gameplay objectively. Game events and dialogue are mapped to four linguistically-agnostic constraint classes-evidence, phenomena, assertions, and hypotheses. Hard constraints prune impossible role assignments, while weighted soft constraints score the remainder; information-gain weighting links each hypothesis to its expected value under entropy reduction, and a simple closed-form scoring rule guarantees that truthful assertions converge to classical hard logic with minimum error. The resulting posterior over roles is fully interpretable and updates in real time.

Departing from conventional autoencoder and neural network pipelines, the proposed method leverages the MedGemma foundation model, incorporating a SigLIP-derived vision encoder pretrained on diverse medical imaging modalities. Preprocessed X-ray images are encoded into high-dimensional embeddings using the MedGemma vision backbone, which are subsequently passed through a lightweight multilayer perceptron for binary classification. Experimental assessment reveals that the MedGemma-driven classifier exhibits strong performance, exceeding conventional convolutional and autoencoder-based metrics. Additionally, the model leverages MedGemma's transfer learning capabilities, enhancing generalization and optimizing feature engineering. The integration of a modern medical foundation model not only enhances representation learning but also facilitates modular training strategies such as selective encoder block unfreezing for efficient domain adaptation. The findings suggest that MedGemma-powered classification systems can advance clinical radiograph triage by providing scalable and accurate abnormality detection, with potential for broader applications in automated medical image analysis.\n  Keywords: Google MedGemma, MURA, Medical Image, Classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eMedGemma\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u808c\u8089\u9aa8\u9abcX\u5149\u7247\u5f02\u5e38\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5377\u79ef\u548c\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u4ee3\u533b\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528MedGemma\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c06X\u5149\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5757\u89e3\u51bb\u7b49\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "MedGemma\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u52b2\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u5377\u79ef\u548c\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "MedGemma\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e34\u5e8aX\u5149\u7247\u5206\u8bca\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

All constructions are based on integral functionals defined by suitable probability densities and orthogonal polynomials within quadratic trial spaces. We provide a comprehensive analysis that establishes unisolvence and derives necessary and sufficient conditions on the densities to guarantee well-posedness. Representative density families, including two-parameter symmetric Dirichlet laws and convexly blended volumetric families, are examined in detail, and a general procedure for constructing the associated quadratic basis functions is outlined.

We challenge this narrative by observing that RL-enhanced models consistently outperform their base and supervised fine-tuned (SFT) counterparts on pure knowledge recall tasks, particularly those requiring traversal of hierarchical, structured knowledge (e.g., medical codes). We hypothesize these gains stem not from newly acquired data, but from improved procedural skills in navigating and searching existing knowledge hierarchies within the model parameters. To support this hypothesis, we show that structured prompting, which explicitly guides SFTed models through hierarchical traversal, recovers most of the performance gap (reducing 24pp to 7pp on MedConceptsQA for DeepSeek-V3/R1). We further find that while prompting improves final-answer accuracy, RL-enhanced models retain superior ability to recall correct procedural paths on deep-retrieval tasks. Finally our layer-wise internal activation analysis reveals that while factual representations (e.g., activations for the statement \"code 57.95 refers to urinary infection\") maintain high cosine similarity between SFT and RL models, query representations (e.g., \"what is code 57.95\") diverge noticeably, indicating that RL primarily transforms how models traverse knowledge rather than the knowledge representation itself.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6539\u5584\u7684\u662f\u77e5\u8bc6\u904d\u5386\u8fc7\u7a0b\u800c\u975e\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u672c\u8eab\u3002", "motivation": "\u6311\u6218\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\u2014\u2014RL\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0RL\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u5c42\u7ea7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83RL\u4e0eSFT\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u904d\u5386\u548c\u8868\u793a\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "RL\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u7f16\u7801\u7b49\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548cSFT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u80fd\u7f29\u5c0f\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u4f46RL\u5728\u6df1\u5c42\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0a\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "RL\u4e3b\u8981\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u904d\u5386\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6539\u53d8\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u8fd9\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

To address the challenges of scalability and expertise dependence, we present Data Agent, a fully autonomous system specialized for tabular data. Leveraging large language model (LLM) reasoning and grounded validation, Data Agent automatically performs data cleaning, hierarchical routing, and feature-level optimization through dual feedback loops. It embodies three core principles: automatic, safe, and non-expert friendly, which ensure end-to-end reliability without human supervision.

High deposition rate robotic AM (HDRRAM) processes, such as cold spray additive manufacturing (CSAM), offer significantly increased build speeds by delivering large volumes of material per unit time. However, maintaining shape accuracy remains a critical challenge, particularly due to process instabilities in current open-loop systems. Detecting these deviations as they occur is essential to prevent error propagation, ensure part quality, and minimize post-processing requirements. This study presents a real-time monitoring system to acquire and reconstruct the growing part and directly compares it with a near-net reference model to detect the shape deviation during the manufacturing process. The early identification of shape inconsistencies, followed by segmenting and tracking each deviation region, paves the way for timely intervention and compensation to achieve consistent part quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u901f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u589e\u6750\u5236\u9020\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5f62\u72b6\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ca\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u548c\u8865\u507f\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u901f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u589e\u6750\u5236\u9020\uff08\u5982\u51b7\u55b7\u6d82\uff09\u867d\u7136\u6c89\u79ef\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u5f00\u73af\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u5de5\u827a\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f62\u72b6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u504f\u5dee\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u91c7\u96c6\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u6b63\u5728\u751f\u957f\u7684\u96f6\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u8fd1\u51c0\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5236\u9020\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u504f\u5dee\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5272\u548c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u5f62\u72b6\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u53ca\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u504f\u5dee\u533a\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u53ca\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u548c\u8865\u507f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u96f6\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u540e\u5904\u7406\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

We present FiCABU (Fisher-based Context-Adaptive Balanced Unlearning), a software-hardware co-design that brings unlearning to edge AI processors. FiCABU combines (i) Context-Adaptive Unlearning, which begins edits from back-end layers and halts once the target forgetting is reached, with (ii) Balanced Dampening, which scales dampening strength by depth to preserve retain accuracy. These methods are realized in a full RTL design of a RISC-V edge AI processor that integrates two lightweight IPs for Fisher estimation and dampening into a GEMM-centric streaming pipeline, validated on an FPGA prototype and synthesized in 45 nm for power analysis. Across CIFAR-20 and PinsFaceRecognition with ResNet-18 and ViT, FiCABU achieves random-guess forget accuracy while matching the retraining-free Selective Synaptic Dampening (SSD) baseline on retain accuracy, reducing computation by up to 87.52 percent (ResNet-18) and 71.03 percent (ViT). On the INT8 hardware prototype, FiCABU further improves retain preservation and reduces energy to 6.48 percent (CIFAR-20) and 0.13 percent (PinsFaceRecognition) of the SSD baseline.

Accurate localization of the AP is critical for planning and guiding catheter ablation procedures. While traditional diagnostic tree (DT) methods and more recent machine learning (ML) approaches have been proposed to predict AP location from surface electrocardiogram (ECG), they are often constrained by limited anatomical localization resolution, poor interpretability, and the use of small clinical datasets. In this study, we present a Deep Learning (DL) model for the localization of single manifest APs across 24 cardiac regions, trained on a large, physiologically realistic database of synthetic ECGs generated using a personalized virtual heart model. We also integrate eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, Guided Backpropagation, Grad-CAM, and Guided Grad-CAM, into the pipeline. This enables interpretation of DL decision-making and addresses one of the main barriers to clinical adoption: lack of transparency in ML predictions. Our model achieves localization accuracy above 95%, with a sensitivity of 94.32% and specificity of 99.78%.

Previous work has shown that verifying the correctness of individual reasoning steps can further improve the performance and efficiency of LLMs on such tasks and enhance solution interpretability. However, existing verification approaches, such as Process Reward Models (PRMs), are either computationally expensive, limited to specific domains, or require large-scale human or model-generated annotations. Thus, we propose a lightweight alternative for step-level reasoning verification based on data-driven uncertainty scores. We train transformer-based uncertainty quantification heads (UHeads) that use the internal states of a frozen LLM to estimate the uncertainty of its reasoning steps during generation. The approach is fully automatic: target labels are generated either by another larger LLM (e.g., DeepSeek R1) or in a self-supervised manner by the original model itself. UHeads are both effective and lightweight, containing less than 10M parameters. Across multiple domains, including mathematics, planning, and general knowledge question answering, they match or even surpass the performance of PRMs that are up to 810x larger. Our findings suggest that the internal states of LLMs encode their uncertainty and can serve as reliable signals for reasoning verification, offering a promising direction toward scalable and generalizable introspective LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6570\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5UHeads\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3LLM\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u5c11\u4e8e10M\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u6027\u80fd\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u5927810\u500d\u7684PRMs\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982PRMs\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u9886\u57df\u53d7\u9650\u6216\u9700\u8981\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u901a\u7528\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u5934(UHeads)\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3LLM\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6807\u7b7e\u7531\u66f4\u5927LLM\u6216\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u5f0f\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u5e38\u8bc6\u95ee\u7b54\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\uff0cUHeads\u6027\u80fd\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u5927810\u500d\u7684PRMs\uff0c\u8868\u660eLLM\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5185\u7701\u5f0fLLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

In this paper, we address this essential problem by formulating the generation process as learning an optimal, direct transport trajectory between the distribution of the current rendering and the desired target distribution, thereby enabling high-quality generation with smaller Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) values. At first, we theoretically establish SDS as a simplified instance of the Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge framework. We prove that SDS employs the reverse process of an Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge, which, under specific conditions (e.g., a Gaussian noise as one end), collapses to SDS's score function of the pre-trained diffusion model. Based upon this, we introduce Trajectory-Centric Distillation (TraCe), a novel text-to-3D generation framework, which reformulates the mathematically trackable framework of Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge to explicitly construct a diffusion bridge from the current rendering to its text-conditioned, denoised target, and trains a LoRA-adapted model on this trajectory's score dynamics for robust 3D optimization.

To address this gap, we conduct extensive experiments to investigate the entropy dynamics of LLMs trained with RLVR and analyze how model entropy correlates with response diversity, calibration, and performance across various benchmarks. Our findings reveal that the number of off-policy updates, the diversity of training data, and the clipping thresholds in the optimization objective are critical factors influencing the entropy of LLMs trained with RLVR.

In high-level competitions, these nuanced differences become decisive factors in scoring. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-level motion parsing framework for AQA based on enhanced spatial-temporal pose features. On the first level, the Action-Unit Parser is designed with the help of pose extraction to achieve precise action segmentation and comprehensive local-global pose representations. On the second level, Motion Parser is used by spatial-temporal feature learning to capture pose changes and appearance details for each action-unit. Meanwhile, some special conditions other than body-related will impact action scoring, like water splash in diving.

This paper introduces an ontology for scientific benchmarking developed through a unified, community-driven effort that extends the MLCommons ecosystem to cover physics, chemistry, materials science, biology, climate science, and more. Building on prior initiatives such as XAI-BENCH, FastML Science Benchmarks, PDEBench, and the SciMLBench framework, our effort consolidates a large set of disparate benchmarks and frameworks into a single taxonomy of scientific, application, and system-level benchmarks. New benchmarks can be added through an open submission workflow coordinated by the MLCommons Science Working Group and evaluated against a six-category rating rubric that promotes and identifies high-quality benchmarks, enabling stakeholders to select benchmarks that meet their specific needs. The architecture is extensible, supporting future scientific and AI/ML motifs, and we discuss methods for identifying emerging computing patterns for unique scientific workloads.

Conventional approaches like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Variational Inference (VI) face significant scalability and efficiency limitations. This paper introduces a novel, unifying framework for fast Bayesian updates by leveraging harmonic analysis. We demonstrate that representing the prior and likelihood in a suitable orthogonal basis transforms the Bayesian update rule into a spectral convolution. Specifically, the Fourier coefficients of the posterior are shown to be the normalized convolution of the prior and likelihood coefficients. To achieve computational feasibility, we introduce a spectral truncation scheme, which, for smooth functions, yields an exceptionally accurate finite-dimensional approximation and reduces the update to a circular convolution. This formulation allows us to exploit the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), resulting in a deterministic algorithm with O(N log N) complexity -- a substantial improvement over the O(N^2) cost of naive methods. We establish rigorous mathematical criteria for the applicability of our method, linking its efficiency to the smoothness and spectral decay of the involved distributions.

We construct DemogSummary, a novel age-stratified dataset of systematic review primary studies, covering child, adult, and older adult populations.

However, existing methods often assume ideal conditions, overlooking challenges such as sensor failures, environmental disturbances, and data imperfections, which can significantly degrade prediction accuracy. Additionally, previous models have not adequately addressed the considerable variability in driver behavior and accident rates across different vehicle types. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces ROAR, a novel approach for accident detection and prediction. ROAR combines Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), a self adaptive object aware module, and dynamic focal loss to tackle these challenges. The DWT effectively extracts features from noisy and incomplete data, while the object aware module improves accident prediction by focusing on high-risk vehicles and modeling the spatial temporal relationships among traffic agents. Moreover, dynamic focal loss mitigates the impact of class imbalance between positive and negative samples. Evaluated on three widely used datasets, Dashcam Accident Dataset (DAD), Car Crash Dataset (CCD), and AnAn Accident Detection (A3D), our model consistently outperforms existing baselines in key metrics such as Average Precision (AP) and mean Time to Accident (mTTA).

In this work, we present the first framework for personalized image editing in diffusion models, introducing Collaborative Direct Preference Optimization (C-DPO), a novel method that aligns image edits with user-specific preferences while leveraging collaborative signals from like-minded individuals. Our approach encodes each user as a node in a dynamic preference graph and learns embeddings via a lightweight graph neural network, enabling information sharing across users with overlapping visual tastes. We enhance a diffusion model's editing capabilities by integrating these personalized embeddings into a novel DPO objective, which jointly optimizes for individual alignment and neighborhood coherence.

These advancements have solved major obstacles, but also exposed new challenges. For example, processes that were not previously considered bottlenecks, such as hardware synthesis, are becoming limiting factors in the rapid iteration of designs. To mitigate these emerging constraints, multiple efforts have been undertaken to develop an ML-based surrogate model that estimates resource usage of ML accelerator architectures. We introduce wa-hls4ml, a benchmark for ML accelerator resource and latency estimation, and its corresponding initial dataset of over 680,000 fully connected and convolutional neural networks, all synthesized using hls4ml and targeting Xilinx FPGAs. The benchmark evaluates the performance of resource and latency predictors against several common ML model architectures, primarily originating from scientific domains, as exemplar models, and the average performance across a subset of the dataset. Additionally, we introduce GNN- and transformer-based surrogate models that predict latency and resources for ML accelerators. We present the architecture and performance of the models and find that the models generally predict latency and resources for the 75% percentile within several percent of the synthesized resources on the synthetic test dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86wa-hls4ml\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8d85\u8fc768\u4e07\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eGNN\u548ctransformer\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u786c\u4ef6\u5408\u6210\u7b49\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6210\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8eML\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86wa-hls4ml\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ca\u5176\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b68\u4e07\u591a\u4e2a\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528hls4ml\u5408\u6210\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9Xilinx FPGA\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eGNN\u548ctransformer\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf975%\u767e\u5206\u4f4d\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u8d44\u6e90\u76f8\u5dee\u51e0\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u4ee5\u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4bML\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7f13\u89e3\u786c\u4ef6\u5408\u6210\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fed\u4ee3\u74f6\u9888\u3002"}}

This paper proposes a Multi-Reward Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework to fine-tune LLMs toward ethical and bias-free behavior. Our approach constructs a synthetic English-language dataset derived from Chinese-context discrimination categories, including regional, ethnic, and occupational biases. Each instance is paired with both neutral and biased responses to train a reward model based on DeBERTa-v3, which provides multi-dimensional reward signals capturing fairness, neutrality, and linguistic quality. The trained reward model then guides GRPO fine-tuning to optimize model outputs along these ethical dimensions. Experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in bias intensity and improved alignment with non-discriminatory standards without compromising fluency or informativeness.

Prior work on large language model negotiation largely emphasizes autonomous bargaining between agents and omits practical needs such as staged information gathering, explicit authorization boundaries, and systematic feedback integration. We propose GAIA, a governance-first framework for LLM-human agency in B2B negotiation and screening. GAIA defines three essential roles - Principal (human), Delegate (LLM agent), and Counterparty - with an optional Critic to enhance performance, and organizes interactions through three mechanisms: information-gated progression that separates screening from negotiation; dual feedback integration that combines AI critique with lightweight human corrections; and authorization boundaries with explicit escalation paths. Our contributions are fourfold: (1) a formal governance framework with three coordinated mechanisms and four safety invariants for delegation with bounded authorization; (2) information-gated progression via task-completeness tracking (TCI) and explicit state transitions that separate screening from commitment; (3) dual feedback integration that blends Critic suggestions with human oversight through parallel learning channels; and (4) a hybrid validation blueprint that combines automated protocol metrics with human judgment of outcomes and safety.

In addition, CapsNet is slow compared to CNNs when performing the same task and relies on a higher number of parameters. In this work, we introduce Convolutional Fully-Connected Capsule Network (CFC-CapsNet) to address the shortcomings of CapsNet by creating capsules using a different method. We introduce a new layer (CFC layer) as an alternative solution to creating capsules. CFC-CapsNet produces fewer, yet more powerful capsules resulting in higher network accuracy.

This hybrid approach enables users to investigate SAE behavior through targeted, interpretable subsets, facilitating deeper and more nuanced analysis of concept representation in latent space.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668(SAE)\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u805a\u7126\u63a2\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u62d3\u6251\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4e0e\u964d\u7ef4\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u9009\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u8868\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5d4c\u5165\u6280\u672f\u5982UMAP\u5728\u53ef\u89c6\u5316SAE\u7279\u5f81\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u538b\u7f29\u4f2a\u5f71\u3001\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7ed8\u56fe\u548c\u90bb\u57df\u5931\u771f\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u6240\u6709\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u964d\u7ef4\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u5904\u7406\u7cbe\u9009\u6982\u5ff5\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684SAE\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5730\u8868\u793a\u9009\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7528\u6237\u901a\u8fc7\u76ee\u6807\u660e\u786e\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5b50\u96c6\u6765\u7814\u7a76SAE\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u793a\u7684\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u3001\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5168\u9762\u63a2\u7d22SAE\u7279\u5f81\u65f6\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Large language models have become a new tool to help numerical reasoning and understanding these documents. However, prompt quality can have a major effect on how well LLMs perform these financial reasoning tasks. Most current methods tune prompts on fixed datasets of financial text or tabular data, which limits their ability to adapt to new question types or document structures, or they involve costly and manually labeled/curated dataset to help build the prompts. We introduce a self-improving prompt framework driven by data-augmented optimization. In this closed-loop process, we generate synthetic financial tables and document excerpts, verify their correctness and robustness, and then update the prompt based on the results. Specifically, our framework combines a synthetic data generator with verifiers and a prompt optimizer, where the generator produces new examples that exposes weaknesses in the current prompt, the verifiers check the validity and robustness of the produced examples, and the optimizer incrementally refines the prompt in response. By iterating these steps in a feedback cycle, our method steadily improves prompt accuracy on financial reasoning tasks without needing external labels. Evaluation on DocMath-Eval benchmark demonstrates that our system achieves higher performance in both accuracy and robustness than standard prompt methods, underscoring the value of incorporating synthetic data generation into prompt learning for financial applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u793a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u91d1\u878d\u8868\u683c\u548c\u6587\u6863\u7247\u6bb5\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6839\u636e\u7ed3\u679c\u66f4\u65b0\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u91d1\u878d\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u6587\u672c\u6216\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8c03\u6574\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u95ee\u9898\u7c7b\u578b\u6216\u6587\u6863\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8/\u6574\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4ea7\u751f\u66b4\u9732\u5f53\u524d\u63d0\u793a\u5f31\u70b9\u7684\u65b0\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u68c0\u67e5\u751f\u6210\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u6839\u636e\u7ed3\u679c\u9010\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728DocMath-Eval\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u878d\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u91d1\u878d\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Current action recognition models, often relying on RGB video, learn superficial correlations between patterns and action labels, so they struggle to capture underlying physical interaction dynamics and human poses in complex scenes. We propose a model architecture that grounds action recognition in physical space by fusing two powerful, complementary representations: V-JEPA 2's contextual, predictive world dynamics and CoMotion's explicit, occlusion-tolerant human pose data. Our model is validated on both the InHARD and UCF-19-Y-OCC benchmarks for general action recognition and high-occlusion action recognition, respectively.

Existing lower bounds rely on what we refer to as infrequent sampling arguments, where long intervals without exploration allow adversarial reward changes that induce large regret.\n  In this paper, we introduce a fundamentally different approach based on a belief inertia argument. Our analysis captures how an algorithm's empirical beliefs, encoded through historical reward averages, create momentum that resists new evidence after a change. We show how this inertia can be exploited to construct adversarial instances that mislead classical algorithms such as Explore Then Commit, epsilon greedy, and UCB, causing them to suffer regret that grows linearly with T and with a substantial constant factor, regardless of how their parameters are tuned, even with a single change point.\n  We extend the analysis to algorithms that periodically restart to handle non stationarity and prove that, even then, the worst case regret remains linear in T.

The system requires only 1.87M trainable parameters (1.37% of full fine-tuning) and trains in approximately 2 hours on a single T4 GPU, making robust hate speech detection accessible in resource-constrained environments while maintaining competitive accuracy for real-world deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u7684\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c4\u5219\u9884\u8fc7\u6ee4\u3001LoRA\u8c03\u4f18\u7684BERTweet\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u630194%\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u7f29\u5c0f100\u500d\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u4ec5\u97001.87M\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u89c4\u5219\u9884\u8fc7\u6ee4\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684LoRA\u8c03\u4f18BERTweet\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7edf\u4e00\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u8fbe\u52300.85\u5b8fF1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u76f8\u5f53\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b94%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5c0f100\u500d\uff08134M vs 14B\u53c2\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u4ec5\u97001.87M\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u5355T4 GPU\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ea62\u5c0f\u65f6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

PCD are widely applied in advanced manufacturing processes, including additive, subtractive, and hybrid manufacturing. To ensure the consistency of analysis and avoid false alarms, preprocessing steps such as registration and mesh reconstruction are commonly applied prior to monitoring. However, these steps are error-prone, time-consuming and may introduce artifacts, potentially affecting monitoring outcomes. In this paper, we present a novel registration-free approach for monitoring PCD of complex shapes, eliminating the need for both registration and mesh reconstruction. Our proposal consists of two alternative feature learning methods and a common monitoring scheme. Feature learning methods leverage intrinsic geometric properties of the shape, captured via the Laplacian and geodesic distances. In the monitoring scheme, thresholding techniques are used to further select intrinsic features most indicative of potential out-of-control conditions.

In this work, we propose a novel analytical framework that recasts a multi-layer ReLU network into an equivalent single-layer linear model with input-dependent \"effective weights\". For any given input sample, the activation pattern of ReLU units creates a unique computational path, effectively zeroing out a subset of weights in the network. By composing the active weights across all layers, we can derive an effective weight matrix, $W_{\\text{eff}}(x)$, that maps the input directly to the output for that specific sample. We posit that the evolution of these effective weights reveals fundamental principles of representation learning. Our work demonstrates that as training progresses, the effective weights corresponding to samples from the same class converge, while those from different classes diverge.

Existing work simply fuses information from various modalities to learn stance representations, overlooking the varying contributions of stance expression from different modalities. Therefore, stance misunderstanding noises may be drawn into the stance learning process due to the risk of learning errors by rough modality combination. To address this, we get inspiration from the dual-process theory of human cognition and propose **ReMoD**, a framework that **Re**thinks **Mo**dality contribution of stance expression through a **D**ual-reasoning paradigm. ReMoD integrates *experience-driven intuitive reasoning* to capture initial stance cues with *deliberate reflective reasoning* to adjust for modality biases, refine stance judgments, and thereby dynamically weight modality contributions based on their actual expressive power for the target stance. Specifically, the intuitive stage queries the Modality Experience Pool (MEP) and Semantic Experience Pool (SEP) to form an initial stance hypothesis, prioritizing historically impactful modalities. This hypothesis is then refined in the reflective stage via two reasoning chains: Modality-CoT updates MEP with adaptive fusion strategies to amplify relevant modalities, while Semantic-CoT refines SEP with deeper contextual insights of stance semantics. These dual experience structures are continuously refined during training and recalled at inference to guide robust and context-aware stance decisions.

Few metrics exist for measuring cultural faithfulness. We introduce CULTIVate, a benchmark for evaluating T2I models on cross-cultural activities (e.g., greetings, dining, games, traditional dances, and cultural celebrations). CULTIVate spans 16 countries with 576 prompts and more than 19,000 images, and provides an explainable descriptor-based evaluation framework across multiple cultural dimensions, including background, attire, objects, and interactions. We propose four metrics to measure cultural alignment, hallucination, exaggerated elements, and diversity.

While data-driven models show promise in SST prediction, their black-box nature often limits interpretability and overlooks key physical processes. Recently, physics-informed neural networks have been gaining momentum but struggle with complex ocean-atmosphere dynamics due to 1) inadequate characterization of seawater movement (e.g., coastal upwelling) and 2) insufficient integration of external SST drivers (e.g., turbulent heat fluxes). To address these challenges, we propose SSTODE, a physics-informed Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) framework for SST prediction. First, we derive ODEs from fluid transport principles, incorporating both advection and diffusion to model ocean spatiotemporal dynamics. Through variational optimization, we recover a latent velocity field that explicitly governs the temporal dynamics of SST. Building upon ODE, we introduce an Energy Exchanges Integrator (EEI)-inspired by ocean heat budget equations-to account for external forcing factors. Thus, the variations in the components of these factors provide deeper insights into SST dynamics.

To this end, we propose \\textbf{ArchCraft}, a Framework that converts abstract architectural descriptions from academic papers into synthesizable Verilog projects with register-transfer level (RTL) verification. ArchCraft introduces a structured workflow, which uses formal graphs to capture the Architectural Blueprint and symbols to define the Functional Specification, translating unstructured academic papers into verifiable, hardware-aware designs. The framework then generates RTL and testbench (TB) code decoupled via these symbols to facilitate verification and debugging, ultimately reporting the circuit's Power, Area, and Performance (PPA). Moreover, we propose the first benchmark, \\textbf{ArchSynthBench}, for synthesizing hardware from architectural descriptions, with a complete set of evaluation indicators, 50 project-level circuits, and around 600 circuit blocks. We systematically assess ArchCraft on ArchSynthBench, where the experiment results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, surpassing direct generation methods and the VerilogCoder framework in both paper understanding and code completion.

Existing text-based geocoding tools perform poorly in multilingual and unstructured news environments, where incomplete place descriptions and mixed Bangla-English scripts obscure spatial context. To address these limitations, this study introduces ALIGN (Accident Location Inference through Geo-Spatial Neural Reasoning)- a vision-language framework that emulates human spatial reasoning to infer accident coordinates directly from textual and map-based cues. ALIGN integrates large language and vision-language models within a multi-stage pipeline that performs optical character recognition, linguistic reasoning, and map-level verification through grid-based spatial scanning. The framework systematically evaluates each predicted location against contextual and visual evidence, ensuring interpretable, fine-grained geolocation outcomes without requiring model retraining. Applied to Bangla-language news data, ALIGN demonstrates consistent improvements over traditional geoparsing methods, accurately identifying district and sub-district-level crash sites. Beyond its technical contribution, the framework establishes a high accuracy foundation for automated crash mapping in data-scarce regions, supporting evidence-driven road-safety policymaking and the broader integration of multimodal artificial intelligence in transportation analytics.

We introduce VMDT (Video-Modal DecodingTrust), the first unified platform for evaluating text-to-video (T2V) and video-to-text (V2T) models across five key trustworthiness dimensions: safety, hallucination, fairness, privacy, and adversarial robustness. Through our extensive evaluation of 7 T2V models and 19 V2T models using VMDT, we uncover several significant insights. For instance, all open-source T2V models evaluated fail to recognize harmful queries and often generate harmful videos, while exhibiting higher levels of unfairness compared to image modality models. In V2T models, unfairness and privacy risks rise with scale, whereas hallucination and adversarial robustness improve -- though overall performance remains low.

This study introduces the Licensing Oracle, an architectural solution designed to stem hallucinations in LMs by enforcing truth constraints through formal validation against structured knowledge graphs. Unlike statistical approaches that rely on data scaling or fine-tuning, the Licensing Oracle embeds a deterministic validation step into the model's generative process, ensuring that only factually accurate claims are made. We evaluated the effectiveness of the Licensing Oracle through experiments comparing it with several state-of-the-art methods, including baseline language model generation, fine-tuning for factual recall, fine-tuning for abstention behavior, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Our results demonstrate that although RAG and fine-tuning improve performance, they fail to eliminate hallucinations. In contrast, the Licensing Oracle achieved perfect abstention precision (AP = 1.0) and zero false answers (FAR-NE = 0.0), ensuring that only valid claims were generated with 89.1% accuracy in factual responses. This work shows that architectural innovations, such as the Licensing Oracle, offer a necessary and sufficient solution for hallucinations in domains with structured knowledge representations, offering guarantees that statistical methods cannot match.

By comparing screw combinations, the approach demonstrates consistent accuracy in both pairing and registration tasks. The method also employs 2D-3D alignment with screw CAD 3D models to accurately pair and estimate screw pose from dual views. Our results show that the correct screw combination consistently outperforms incorrect pairings across all test cases, even prior to registration.

When $\u03c4$ is unknown, a fundamental scale ambiguity emerges that couples $\u03c4$ with the reward parameters ($\u03b8$), making them statistically unidentifiable. We introduce Blind-IGT, the first statistical framework to jointly recover both $\u03b8$ and $\u03c4$ from observed behavior. We analyze this bilinear inverse problem and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for unique identification by introducing a normalization constraint that resolves the scale ambiguity.

Recent methods have further improved LLM performance in complex mathematical reasoning. However, when extending these methods beyond the domain of mathematical reasoning to tasks involving complex domain-specific knowledge, we observe a consistent failure of LLMs to generate novel insights during the reflection stage. Instead of conducting genuine cognitive refinement, the model tends to mechanically reiterate earlier reasoning steps without introducing new information or perspectives, a phenomenon referred to as \"Echo Reflection\". We attribute this behavior to two key defects: (1) Uncontrollable information flow during response generation, which allows premature intermediate thoughts to propagate unchecked and distort final decisions; (2) Insufficient exploration of internal knowledge during reflection, leading to repeating earlier findings rather than generating new cognitive insights. Building on these findings, we proposed a novel reinforcement learning method termed Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO). Specifically, the AEPO framework consists of two major components: (1) Reflection-aware Information Filtration, which quantifies the cognitive information flow and prevents the final answer from being affected by earlier bad cognitive information; (2) Adaptive-Entropy Optimization, which dynamically balances exploration and exploitation across different reasoning stages, promoting both reflective diversity and answer correctness.

In this work, we introduce a new reasoning data generation framework spanning diverse skills and levels of complexity with over 1M high-quality synthetic vision-centric questions. The dataset also includes preference data and instruction prompts supporting both offline and online RL. Our synthesis framework proceeds in two stages: (1) scale; and (2) complexity. Reasoning traces are then synthesized through a two-stage process that leverages VLMs and reasoning LLMs, producing CoT traces for VLMs that capture the richness and diverse cognitive behaviors found in frontier reasoning models. Remarkably, we show that finetuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on our data outperforms all open-data baselines across all evaluated vision-centric benchmarks, and even surpasses strong closed-data models such as MiMo-VL-7B-RL on V* Bench, CV-Bench and MMStar-V. Perhaps most surprising, despite being entirely vision-centric, our data transfers positively to text-only reasoning (MMLU-Pro) and audio reasoning (MMAU), demonstrating its effectiveness. Similarly, despite not containing videos or embodied visual data, we observe notable gains when evaluating on a single-evidence embodied QA benchmark (NiEH). Finally, we use our data to analyze the entire VLM post-training pipeline. Our empirical analysis highlights that (i) SFT on high-quality data with non-linear reasoning traces is essential for effective online RL, (ii) staged offline RL matches online RL's performance while reducing compute demands, and (iii) careful SFT on high quality data can substantially improve out-of-domain, cross-modality transfer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc7100\u4e07\u4e2a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6280\u80fd\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u79bb\u7ebf/\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u8fdb\u5c55\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u672a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e13\u6709\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8d85\u8d8a\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u5b66\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5305\u542b\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u524d\u6cbf\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u8ba4\u77e5\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728Qwen2.5-VL-7B\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u6240\u6709\u5f00\u6e90\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8fc7MiMo-VL-7B-RL\u7b49\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b8c\u5168\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u636e\u5728\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u97f3\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u4e5f\u6709\u6b63\u5411\u8fc1\u79fb\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u6709\u6548\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u5339\u914d\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\uff1b\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, due to its iterative refinement process, the inference is often bottlenecked by slow and static sampling speed. To overcome this problem, we introduce `KL-Adaptive Stability Sampling' (KLASS), a fast yet effective sampling method that exploits token-level KL divergence to identify stable, high-confidence predictions. By unmasking multiple tokens in each iteration without any additional model training, our approach speeds up generation significantly while maintaining sample quality. On reasoning benchmarks, KLASS achieves up to $2.78\\times$ wall-clock speedups while improving performance over standard greedy decoding, attaining state-of-the-art results among diffusion-based samplers.

To rigorously assess safety judgments, we construct HAJailBench, a large-scale human-annotated jailbreak benchmark comprising 12,000 adversarial interactions across diverse attack methods and target models. The dataset provides fine-grained, expert-labeled ground truth for evaluating both safety robustness and judge reliability. Our SLM-based framework achieves agreement comparable to GPT-4o judges on HAJailBench while substantially reducing inference cost. Ablation results show that three rounds of debate yield the optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency.

Although foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) demonstrate strong zero-shot and prompt-guided segmentation capabilities, their performance deteriorates substantially when transferred to medical imaging domains. Current adaptation studies mainly emphasize architectural modifications, while the influence of data characteristics and training regimes has not been systematically examined. In this study, we present a comprehensive, data-centric investigation of SAM2 adaptation for ultrasound video segmentation. We analyze how training-set size, video duration, and augmentation schemes affect adaptation performance under three paradigms: task-specific fine-tuning, intermediate adaptation, and multi-task joint training, across five SAM2 variants and multiple prompting modes. We further design six ultrasound-specific augmentations, assessing their effect relative to generic strategies. Experiments on three representative ultrasound datasets reveal that data scale and temporal context play a more decisive role than model architecture or initialization. Moreover, joint training offers an efficient compromise between modality alignment and task specialization.

Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning (DRRL) addresses this by optimizing for worst-case performance within an uncertainty set defined by a robustness budget $\u03b5$. However, fixing $\u03b5$ results in a tradeoff between performance and robustness: small values yield high nominal performance but weak robustness, while large values can result in instability and overly conservative policies. We propose Distributionally Robust Self-Paced Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (DR-SPCRL), a method that overcomes this limitation by treating $\u03b5$ as a continuous curriculum. DR-SPCRL adaptively schedules the robustness budget according to the agent's progress, enabling a balance between nominal and robust performance. Empirical results across multiple environments demonstrate that DR-SPCRL not only stabilizes training but also achieves a superior robustness-performance trade-off, yielding an average 11.8\\% increase in episodic return under varying perturbations compared to fixed or heuristic scheduling strategies, and achieving approximately 1.9$\\times$ the performance of the corresponding nominal RL algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDR-SPCRL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9884\u7b97\u03b5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u8bfe\u7a0b\u6765\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfDRRL\u4e2d\u56fa\u5b9a\u03b5\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u7ecf\u5e38\u56e0\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u800c\u5931\u6548\u3002\u4f20\u7edfDRRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u56fa\u5b9a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9884\u7b97\u03b5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u5c0f\u03b5\u503c\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\u4f46\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5f31\uff0c\u5927\u03b5\u503c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u81ea\u6b65\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60(DR-SPCRL)\uff0c\u5c06\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9884\u7b97\u03b5\u89c6\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fdb\u5c55\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u5ea6\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u540d\u4e49\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDR-SPCRL\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8fd8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027-\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u76f8\u6bd4\u56fa\u5b9a\u6216\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u60c5\u8282\u56de\u62a5\u589e\u52a011.8%\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u76f8\u5e94\u540d\u4e49RL\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7ea61.9\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "DR-SPCRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u5ea6\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86DRRL\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

The current analysis works use image captioning tasks and visual question answering. In this work, we propose using the Referring Expression Comprehension task instead as a platform for the evaluation of spatial reasoning by VLMs. This platform provides the opportunity for a deeper analysis of spatial comprehension and grounding abilities when there is 1) ambiguity in object detection, 2) complex spatial expressions with a longer sentence structure and multiple spatial relations, and 3) expressions with negation ('not'). In our analysis, we use task-specific architectures as well as large VLMs and highlight their strengths and weaknesses in dealing with these specific situations.

However, while the discrete-token CoT reasoning pattern can be reinforced through policy optimization algorithms such as group relative policy optimization (GRPO), extending the soft-thinking pattern with Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains challenging. This difficulty stems from the complexities of injecting stochasticity into soft-thinking tokens and updating soft-thinking policies accordingly. As a result, previous attempts to combine soft-thinking with GRPO typically underperform their discrete-token GRPO counterparts. To fully unlock the potential of soft-thinking, this paper presents a novel policy optimization algorithm, SofT-GRPO, to reinforce LLMs under the soft-thinking reasoning pattern. SofT-GRPO injects the Gumbel noise into logits, employs the Gumbel-Softmax technique to avoid soft-thinking tokens outside the pre-trained embedding space, and leverages the reparameterization trick in policy gradient. We conduct experiments across base LLMs ranging from 1.5B to 7B parameters, and results demonstrate that SofT-GRPO enables soft-thinking LLMs to slightly outperform discrete-token GRPO on Pass@1 (+0.13% on average accuracy), while exhibiting a substantial uplift on Pass@32 (+2.19% on average accuracy).

To appear in Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS), Springer", "summary": "The detection of clinically significant prostate cancer lesions (csPCa) from biparametric magnetic resonance imaging (bp-MRI) has emerged as a noninvasive imaging technique for improving accurate diagnosis. Nevertheless, the analysis of such images remains highly dependent on the subjective expert interpretation. Deep learning approaches have been proposed for csPCa lesions detection and segmentation, but they remain limited due to their reliance on extensively annotated datasets. Moreover, the high lesion variability across prostate zones poses additional challenges, even for expert radiologists. This work introduces a second-order geometric attention (SOGA) mechanism that guides a dedicated segmentation network, through skip connections, to detect csPCa lesions. The proposed attention is modeled on the Riemannian manifold, learning from symmetric positive definitive (SPD) representations. The proposed mechanism was integrated into standard U-Net and nnU-Net backbones, and was validated on the publicly available PI-CAI dataset, achieving an Average Precision (AP) of 0.37 and an Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.83, outperforming baseline networks and attention-based methods.

However, acquiring GUI data remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often involve designing automated agents that browse URLs from the Common Crawl, using webpage HTML to collect screenshots and corresponding annotations, including the names and bounding boxes of UI elements. However, this method is difficult to apply to desktop software or some newly launched websites not included in the Common Crawl. While we expect the model to possess strong generalization capabilities to handle this, it is still crucial for personalized scenarios that require rapid and perfect adaptation to new software or websites. To address this, we propose an automated data collection method with minimal annotation costs, named Auto-Explorer. It incorporates a simple yet effective exploration mechanism that autonomously parses and explores GUI environments, gathering data efficiently. Additionally, to assess the quality of exploration, we have developed the UIXplore benchmark. This benchmark creates environments for explorer agents to discover and save software states. Using the data gathered, we fine-tune a multimodal large language model (MLLM) and establish a GUI element grounding testing set to evaluate the effectiveness of the exploration strategies.

However, these trained router models often lack robustness under domain shifts and require expensive data synthesis techniques such as Monte Carlo rollouts to obtain sufficient ground-truth routing labels for training. In this work, we propose Confidence-Guided Stepwise Model Routing for Cost-Efficient Reasoning (STEER), a domain-agnostic framework that performs fine-grained, step-level routing between smaller and larger LLMs without utilizing external models. STEER leverages confidence scores from the smaller model's logits prior to generating a reasoning step, so that the large model is invoked only when necessary. Extensive evaluations using different LLMs on a diverse set of challenging benchmarks across multiple domains such as Mathematical Reasoning, Multi-Hop QA, and Planning tasks indicate that STEER achieves competitive or enhanced accuracy while reducing inference costs (up to +20% accuracy with 48% less FLOPs compared to solely using the larger model on AIME), outperforming baselines that rely on trained external modules.

While recent vision-language representation learning methods have shown promise, their potential in UDA segmentation tasks remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose TCSA-UDA, a Text-driven Cross-Semantic Alignment framework that leverages domain-invariant textual class descriptions to guide visual representation learning. Our approach introduces a vision-language covariance cosine loss to directly align image encoder features with inter-class textual semantic relations, encouraging semantically meaningful and modality-invariant feature representations.

While in-context learning (ICL) provides a parameter-efficient alternative to fine-tuning, existing ICL approaches often suffer from task recognition failure, suboptimal demonstration selection, and misalignment between label words and task objectives, issues that are amplified in clinical domains like AD detection. We propose Explicit Knowledge In-Context Learners (EK-ICL), a novel framework that integrates structured explicit knowledge to enhance reasoning stability and task alignment in ICL. EK-ICL incorporates three knowledge components: confidence scores derived from small language models (SLMs) to ground predictions in task-relevant patterns, parsing feature scores to capture structural differences and improve demo selection, and label word replacement to resolve semantic misalignment with LLM priors. In addition, EK-ICL employs a parsing-based retrieval strategy and ensemble prediction to mitigate the effects of semantic homogeneity in AD transcripts. Extensive experiments across three AD datasets demonstrate that EK-ICL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning and ICL baselines. Further analysis reveals that ICL performance in AD detection is highly sensitive to the alignment of label semantics and task-specific context, underscoring the importance of explicit knowledge in clinical reasoning under low-resource conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "EK-ICL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u663e\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc6\u522b\u5931\u8d25\u3001\u6f14\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u6b21\u4f18\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u8bcd\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u9519\u4f4d\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u9886\u57df\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEK-ICL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e09\u4e2a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5206\u6570\u3001\u89e3\u6790\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6570\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u6f14\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u8bcd\u66ff\u6362\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8bed\u4e49\u9519\u4f4d\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEK-ICL\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u6807\u7b7e\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u663e\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Current methodologies utilize deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) techniques to expedite SM calibration; nevertheless, these strategies do not fully exploit physical prior knowledge associated with the SM, such as symmetric positional priors. Consequently, we integrated positional priors into existing frameworks for SM calibration. Underpinned by theoretical justification, we empirically validated the efficacy of incorporating positional priors through experiments involving both 2D and 3D SM SR methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u5230\u78c1\u7c92\u5b50\u6210\u50cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u77e9\u9635\u6821\u51c6\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u52a0\u901f\u6821\u51c6\u8fc7\u7a0b", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7cfb\u7edf\u77e9\u9635\u6821\u51c6\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u590d\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08\u5982\u5bf9\u79f0\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5148\u9a8c\uff09", "method": "\u5c06\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u77e9\u9635\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u8bba\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u57282D\u548c3D\u7cfb\u7edf\u77e9\u9635\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6574\u5408\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u77e9\u9635\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6821\u51c6\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027", "conclusion": "\u6574\u5408\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u78c1\u7c92\u5b50\u6210\u50cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u77e9\u9635\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u6027\u80fd"}}

Traditional computational models often rely on structural information alone and thus fail to capture the genetic determinants that influence disease mechanisms and therapeutic responses. To address this gap, we propose GastroDL-Fusion, a dual-modal deep learning framework that integrates protein-ligand complex data with disease-associated gene sequence information for drug and vaccine development. In our approach, protein-ligand complexes are represented as molecular graphs and modeled using a Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN), while gene sequences are encoded into biologically meaningful embeddings via a pre-trained Transformer (ProtBERT/ESM). These complementary modalities are fused through a multi-layer perceptron to enable robust cross-modal interaction learning. We evaluate the model on benchmark datasets of GI disease-related targets, demonstrating that GastroDL-Fusion significantly improves predictive performance over conventional methods. Specifically, the model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.12 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.75, outperforming CNN, BiLSTM, GIN, and Transformer-only baselines.

This thesis explores the direction of enhancing agents' zero-shot systematic generalization abilities by granting RL agents reasoning behaviors that are found to help systematic generalization in the human brain. Inspired by human conscious planning behaviors, we first introduced a top-down attention mechanism, which allows a decision-time planning agent to dynamically focus its reasoning on the most relevant aspects of the environmental state given its instantaneous intentions, a process we call \"spatial abstraction\". This approach significantly improves systematic generalization outside the training tasks. Subsequently, building on spatial abstraction, we developed the Skipper framework to automatically decompose complex tasks into simpler, more manageable sub-tasks. Skipper provides robustness against distributional shifts and efficacy in long-term, compositional planning by focusing on pertinent spatial and temporal elements of the environment. Finally, we identified a common failure mode and safety risk in planning agents that rely on generative models to generate state targets during planning. It is revealed that most agents blindly trust the targets they hallucinate, resulting in delusional planning behaviors. Inspired by how the human brain rejects delusional intentions, we propose learning a feasibility evaluator to enable rejecting hallucinated infeasible targets, which led to significant performance improvements in various kinds of planning agents. Finally, we suggest directions for future research, aimed at achieving general task abstraction and fully enabling abstract planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4eba\u7c7b\u5927\u8111\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u6765\u589e\u5f3aRL\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u62bd\u8c61\u3001Skipper\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u89c4\u5212\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u6709\u610f\u8bc6\u89c4\u5212\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f4\u62bd\u8c61\uff1b2. \u5f00\u53d1Skipper\u6846\u67b6\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b3. \u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u6765\u62d2\u7edd\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u957f\u671f\u7ec4\u5408\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c4\u5212\u4ee3\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5984\u60f3\u89c4\u5212\u884c\u4e3a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86RL\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u62bd\u8c61\u89c4\u5212\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) effectively capture local features, they struggle with modeling long-range dependencies. Transformers mitigate this issue with self-attention mechanisms but lack the ability to preserve local contextual information. State-of-the-art models primarily follow an encoder-decoder architecture, achieving notable success. However, two key limitations remain: (1) Shallow layers, which are closer to the input, capture fine-grained details but suffer from information loss as data propagates through deeper layers. (2) Inefficient integration of local details and global context between the encoder and decoder stages. To address these challenges, we propose the MACMD-based decoder, which enhances attention mechanisms and facilitates channel mixing between encoder and decoder stages via skip connections. This design leverages hierarchical dilated convolutions, attention-driven modulation, and a cross channel-mixing module to capture long-range dependencies while preserving local contextual details, essential for precise medical image segmentation.

For this task, we constructed CDrugRed, a high-quality dataset consisting of 5,894 de-identified hospitalization records from 3,190 patients in China.

Despite significant progress, designing an accurate and efficient end-to-end text spotter for arbitrary-shaped text remains largely unsolved. We identify the primary bottleneck as the lack of a reliable and efficient text detection method. To address this, we propose a novel parameterized text shape method based on low-rank approximation for precise detection and a triple assignment detection head to enable fast inference. Specifically, unlike other shape representation methods that employ data-irrelevant parameterization, our data-driven approach derives a low-rank subspace directly from labeled text boundaries. To ensure this process is robust against the inherent annotation noise in this data, we utilize a specialized recovery method based on an $\\ell_1$-norm formulation, which accurately reconstructs the text shape with only a few key orthogonal vectors. By exploiting the inherent shape correlation among different text contours, our method achieves consistency and compactness in shape representation. Next, the triple assignment scheme introduces a novel architecture where a deep sparse branch (for stabilized training) is used to guide the learning of an ultra-lightweight sparse branch (for accelerated inference), while a dense branch provides rich parallel supervision. Building upon these advancements, we integrate the enhanced detection module with a lightweight recognition branch to form an end-to-end text spotting framework, termed LRANet++, capable of accurately and efficiently spotting arbitrary-shaped text.

The central innovation of QiVC lies in its quantum-inspired rotated ensemble (QiRE) mechanism. QiRE performs differentiable low-dimensional subspace rotations of convolutional weights, analogously to quantum state evolution. This approach enables structured uncertainty modeling while preserving the intrinsic geometry of the parameter space, resulting in more expressive, stable, and uncertainty-aware representations. To demonstrate its practical potential, the concept is instantiated in a QiVC-based convolutional network (QiVC-Net) and evaluated in the context of biosignal classification, focusing on phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings, a challenging domain characterized by high noise, inter-subject variability, and often imbalanced data. The proposed QiVC-Net integrates an architecture in which the QiVC layer does not introduce additional parameters, instead performing an ensemble rotation of the convolutional weights through a structured mechanism ensuring robustness without added highly computational burden. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, PhysioNet CinC 2016 and PhysioNet CirCor DigiScope 2022, show that QiVC-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching accuracies of 97.84% and 97.89%, respectively.

Local attention reduces complexity by restricting attention to neighborhoods. Block-sparse kernels can further improve the efficiency of local attention, but conventional local attention patterns often fail to deliver significant speedups because tokens within a window are not contiguous in the 1D sequence. This work proposes a novel method for constructing windows and neighborhoods based on the Hilbert curve. Image tokens are first reordered along a Hilbert curve, and windows and neighborhoods are then formed on the reordered 1D sequence. From a block-sparse perspective, this strategy significantly increases block sparsity and can be combined with existing block-sparse kernels to improve the efficiency of 2D local attention. Experiments show that the proposed Hilbert Window Attention and Hilbert Slide Attention can accelerate window attention and slide attention by about $4\\times$ and $18\\times$, respectively. To assess practicality, the strategy is instantiated as the Hilbert Window Transformer and the Hilbert Neighborhood Transformer, both of which achieve end-to-end speedups with minimal accuracy loss. Overall, combining Hilbert-guided local attention with block-sparse kernels offers a general and practical approach to enhancing the efficiency of 2D local attention for images.

We propose an active learning algorithm (\"PartiBandits\") to estimate $\\mathbb{E}[Y]$. The algorithm yields an estimate, $\\widehat\u03bc_{\\text{PB}}$, such that $\\left( \\widehat\u03bc_{\\text{PB}} - \\mathbb{E}[Y]\\right)^2$ is $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left( \\frac{\u03bd+ \\exp(c \\cdot (-N/\\log(N))) }{N} \\right)$, where $c > 0$ is a constant and $\u03bd$ is the risk of the Bayes-optimal classifier. PartiBandits is essentially a two-stage algorithm. In the first stage, it learns a partition of the unlabeled data that shrinks the average conditional variance of $Y$. In the second stage it uses a UCB-style subroutine (\"WarmStart-UCB\") to request labels from each stratum round-by-round. Both the main algorithm's and the subroutine's convergence rates are minimax optimal in classical settings. PartiBandits bridges the UCB and disagreement-based approaches to active learning despite these two approaches being designed to tackle very different tasks.

This enables a single model to flexibly perform tasks that previously required specialized models for each domain. However, these methods typically rely on text labels for supervision during training, biasing the model toward textual cues while potentially neglecting the full temporal features. Such a bias can lead to outputs that contradict the underlying time-series context. To address this issue, we construct the EvalTS benchmark, comprising 10 tasks across three difficulty levels, from fundamental temporal pattern recognition to complex real-world reasoning, to evaluate models under more challenging and realistic scenarios. We also propose TimeSense, a multimodal framework that makes LLMs proficient in time-series analysis by balancing textual reasoning with a preserved temporal sense. TimeSense incorporates a Temporal Sense module that reconstructs the input time-series within the model's context, ensuring that textual reasoning is grounded in the time-series dynamics. Moreover, to enhance spatial understanding of time-series data, we explicitly incorporate coordinate-based positional embeddings, which provide each time point with spatial context and enable the model to capture structural dependencies more effectively.

We introduce a detailed ontology mapping core legal contract elements to their graph-theoretic equivalents of nodes and edges. We then present a reinforcement learning based Large Language Model (LLM) framework for segmentation and extraction of entities and relationships from contracts. Our method, GRAPH-GRPO-LEX, incorporates both LLMs and reinforcement learning with group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By applying a carefully drafted reward function of graph metrics, we demonstrate the ability to automatically identify direct relationships between clauses, and even uncover hidden dependencies. Our introduction of the gated GRPO approach shows a strong learning signal and can move contract analysis from a linear, manual reading process to an easily visualized graph.

The existing rPPG model is usually based on the transformer module, which has low computation efficiency. Recently, the Mamba model has garnered increasing attention due to its efficient performance in natural language processing tasks, demonstrating potential as a substitute for transformer-based algorithms. However, the Mambaout model and its variants prove that the SSM module, which is the core component of the Mamba model, is unnecessary for the vision task. Therefore, we hope to prove the feasibility of using the Mambaout-based module to remotely learn the heart rate. Specifically, we propose a novel rPPG algorithm called uncomplicated and enhanced learning capability rPPG (TYrPPG). This paper introduces an innovative gated video understanding block (GVB) designed for efficient analysis of RGB videos. Based on the Mambaout structure, this block integrates 2D-CNN and 3D-CNN to enhance video understanding for analysis.

While SAEs provide crucial insights into LLM explanations, their practical adoption faces a fundamental challenge: better interpretability demands that SAEs' hidden layers have high dimensionality to satisfy sparsity constraints, resulting in prohibitive training and inference costs. Recent Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches attempt to address this by partitioning SAEs into narrower expert networks with gated activation, thereby reducing computation. In a well-designed MoE, each expert should focus on learning a distinct set of features. However, we identify a \\textit{critical limitation} in MoE-SAE: Experts often fail to specialize, which means they frequently learn overlapping or identical features. To deal with it, we propose two key innovations: (1) Multiple Expert Activation that simultaneously engages semantically weighted expert subsets to encourage specialization, and (2) Feature Scaling that enhances diversity through adaptive high-frequency scaling. Experiments demonstrate a 24\\% lower reconstruction error and a 99\\% reduction in feature redundancy compared to existing MoE-SAE methods.

While explicit hate can often be captured through surface features, implicit hate requires deeper, full-model semantic processing. In this work, we question the need for repeated fine-tuning and analyze the role of HatePrototypes, class-level vector representations derived from language models optimized for hate speech detection and safety moderation. We find that these prototypes, built from as few as 50 examples per class, enable cross-task transfer between explicit and implicit hate, with interchangeable prototypes across benchmarks.

Previous work has attempted to catch these unsafe instances by interrogating models directly about their objectives and behaviors. However, the main weakness of trusting interrogations is that models can lie. We propose self-report fine-tuning (SRFT), a simple supervised fine-tuning technique that trains models to admit their factual mistakes when asked. We show that the admission of factual errors in simple question-answering settings generalizes out-of-distribution (OOD) to the admission of hidden misaligned objectives in adversarial agentic settings. We evaluate SRFT in OOD stealth tasks, where models are instructed to complete a hidden misaligned objective alongside a user-specified objective without being caught by monitoring. After SRFT, models are more likely to confess the details of their hidden objectives when interrogated, even under strong pressure not to disclose them. Interrogation on SRFT models can detect hidden objectives with near-ceiling performance (F1 score = 0.98), while the baseline model lies when interrogated under the same conditions (F1 score = 0). Interrogation on SRFT models can further elicit the content of the hidden objective, recovering 28-100% details, compared to 0% details recovered in the baseline model and by prefilled assistant turn attacks.

Handwriting-often disrupted in prodromal AD-provides a non-invasive and cost-effective window into subtle motor and cognitive decline. Existing handwriting-based AD studies, mostly relying on online trajectories and hand-crafted features, have not systematically examined how task type influences diagnostic performance and cross-task generalization. Meanwhile, large-scale vision language models have demonstrated remarkable zero or few-shot anomaly detection in natural images and strong adaptability across medical modalities such as chest X-ray and brain MRI. However, handwriting-based disease detection remains largely unexplored within this paradigm. To close this gap, we introduce a lightweight Cross-Layer Fusion Adapter framework that repurposes CLIP for handwriting-based AD screening. CLFA implants multi-level fusion adapters within the visual encoder to progressively align representations toward handwriting-specific medical cues, enabling prompt-free and efficient zero-shot inference. Using this framework, we systematically investigate cross-task generalization-training on a specific handwriting task and evaluating on unseen ones-to reveal which task types and writing patterns most effectively discriminate AD. Extensive analyses further highlight characteristic stroke patterns and task-level factors that contribute to early AD identification, offering both diagnostic insights and a benchmark for handwriting-based cognitive assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u8de8\u5c42\u878d\u5408\u9002\u914d\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff08CLFA\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b14\u8ff9\u7684\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u7b5b\u67e5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ea7\u878d\u5408\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b14\u8ff9\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7b14\u8ff9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\uff0c\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u65e9\u671f\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u8870\u9000\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u5728\u7ebf\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u624b\u5de5\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u672a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u5bf9\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CLFA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728CLIP\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u690d\u5165\u591a\u7ea7\u878d\u5408\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b14\u8ff9\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u9700\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u54ea\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u4e66\u5199\u6a21\u5f0f\u6700\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u6027\u7b14\u753b\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e9\u671fAD\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bca\u65ad\u89c1\u89e3\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "CLFA\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b14\u8ff9\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u7b14\u8ff9\u75be\u75c5\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This paper introduces the Spatiotemporal Relational Neural Network (SRNN), a model that establishes a unified neural representation for object attributes, relations, and timeline, with computations governed by a Hebbian ``Fire Together, Wire Together'' mechanism across dedicated \\textit{What} and \\textit{How} pathways. This unified representation is directly used to generate structured linguistic descriptions of the visual scene, bridging perception and language within a shared neural substrate. Moreover, unlike the prevalent ``pretrain-then-finetune'' paradigm, SRNN adopts a ``predefine-then-finetune'' approach. On the CLEVRER benchmark, SRNN achieves competitive performance.

Second, we develop enhanced sampling guidance methods that operate on off-the-shelf classifiers without requiring retraining. These include tilted sampling with batch-level reweighting, adaptive entropy-regularized sampling to preserve diversity, and a novel f-divergence-based sampling strategy that strengthens class-consistent guidance while maintaining mode coverage. Experiments on ImageNet 128x128 demonstrate that our divergence-regularized guidance achieves an FID of 2.13 using a ResNet-101 classifier, improving upon existing classifier-guided diffusion methods while requiring no diffusion model retraining.

Lossy compression of gradient data can mitigate this overhead, and error-bounded lossy compression (EBLC) is particularly appealing for its fine-grained utility-compression tradeoff. However, existing EBLC methods (e.g., SZ), originally designed for smooth scientific data with strong spatial locality, rely on generic predictors such as Lorenzo and interpolation for entropy reduction to improve compression ratio. Gradient tensors, in contrast, exhibit low smoothness and weak spatial correlation, rendering these predictors ineffective and leading to poor compression ratios. To address this limitation, we propose an EBLC framework tailored for FL gradient data to achieve high compression ratios while preserving model accuracy. The core of it is an innovative prediction mechanism that exploits temporal correlations across FL training rounds and structural regularities within convolutional kernels to reduce residual entropy. The predictor is compatible with standard quantizers and entropy coders and comprises (1) a cross-round magnitude predictor based on a normalized exponential moving average, and (2) a sign predictor that leverages gradient oscillation and kernel-level sign consistency. Experiments show that this new EBLC yields up to 1.53x higher compression ratios than SZ3 with lower accuracy loss. Integrated into a real-world FL framework, APPFL, it reduces end-to-end communication time by 76.1%-96.2% under various constrained-bandwidth scenarios, demonstrating strong scalability for real-world FL deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u68af\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u6709\u635f\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u8de8\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f6e\u6b21\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u5377\u79ef\u6838\u7ed3\u6784\u89c4\u5f8b\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f02\u6784\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4f4e\u5e26\u5bbd\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6210\u4e3a\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u6709\u635f\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982SZ\uff09\u5bf9\u79d1\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4f4e\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\u3001\u5f31\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6307\u6570\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u5747\u7684\u8de8\u8f6e\u6b21\u5e45\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5229\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u632f\u8361\u548c\u6838\u7ea7\u7b26\u53f7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u3002\u8be5\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u91cf\u5316\u5668\u548c\u71b5\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u517c\u5bb9\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4SZ3\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe1.53\u500d\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002\u5728\u771f\u5b9eFL\u6846\u67b6APPFL\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u53d7\u9650\u5e26\u5bbd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5c06\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u901a\u4fe1\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1176.1%-96.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5EBLC\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u901a\u4fe1\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

For both, LLMs have to demonstrate factual knowledge as well as a deep understanding of drug mechanisms, so they can recall and reason about relevant knowledge in novel situations. Drug mechanisms of action are described as a series of interactions between biomedical entities, which interlink into one or more chains directed from the drug to the targeted disease. Composing the effects of the interactions in a candidate chain leads to an inference about whether the drug might be useful or not for that disease. We introduce a dataset that evaluates LLMs on both factual knowledge of known mechanisms, and their ability to reason about them under novel situations, presented as counterfactuals that the models are unlikely to have seen during training. Using this dataset, we show that o4-mini outperforms the 4o, o3, and o3-mini models from OpenAI, and the recent small Qwen3-4B-thinking model closely matches o4-mini's performance, even outperforming it in some cases. We demonstrate that the open world setting for reasoning tasks, which requires the model to recall relevant knowledge, is more challenging than the closed world setting where the needed factual knowledge is provided. We also show that counterfactuals affecting internal links in the reasoning chain present a much harder task than those affecting a link from the drug mentioned in the prompt.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5728\u836f\u7269\u673a\u5236\u77e5\u8bc6\u638c\u63e1\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5185\u90e8\u94fe\u8def\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u6bd4\u836f\u7269\u94fe\u8def\u66f4\u96be\u3002", "motivation": "\u836f\u7269\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u5bf9LLMs\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u836f\u7269\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u65b0\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5bf9\u5df2\u77e5\u836f\u7269\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u638c\u63e1\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "o4-mini\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8eOpenAI\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\uff0cQwen3-4B-thinking\u6a21\u578b\u4e0eo4-mini\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u6bd4\u5c01\u95ed\u4e16\u754c\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff1b\u5185\u90e8\u94fe\u8def\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u6bd4\u836f\u7269\u94fe\u8def\u66f4\u96be\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u836f\u7269\u673a\u5236\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u94fe\u8def\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5982Qwen3-4B-thinking\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Despite their strengths, these models often encounter challenges in achieving complex reasoning tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Previous works have focused on fine-tuning on specialized mathematical datasets. However, these datasets are typically distilled directly from teacher models, which capture only static reasoning patterns and leaving substantial gaps compared to student models. This reliance on fixed teacher-derived datasets not only restricts the model's ability to adapt to novel or more intricate questions that extend beyond the confines of the training data, but also lacks the iterative depth needed for robust generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose \\textbf{\\method}, a \\textbf{Math}ematical \\textbf{S}elf-\\textbf{E}volving framework for MLLMs. In contrast to traditional one-shot fine-tuning paradigms, \\method iteratively refines the model through cycles of inference, reflection, and reward-based feedback. Specifically, we leverage iterative fine-tuning by incorporating correct reasoning paths derived from previous-stage inference and integrating reflections from a specialized Outcome Reward Model (ORM).

Ceramic package substrates (CPS), as an important electronic material, are essential in IC packaging owing to their superior physical and chemical properties. However, the complex structure and minor defects of CPS, along with the absence of a publically available dataset, significantly hinder the development of CPS surface defect detection. In this study, we construct a high-quality point cloud dataset for 3D segmentation of surface defects in CPS, i.e., CPS3D-Seg, which has the best point resolution and precision compared to existing 3D industrial datasets. CPS3D-Seg consists of 1300 point cloud samples under 20 product categories, and each sample provides accurate point-level annotations. Meanwhile, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark based on SOTA point cloud segmentation algorithms to validate the effectiveness of CPS3D-Seg. Additionally, we propose a novel 3D segmentation method based on causal inference (CINet), which quantifies potential confounders in point clouds through Structural Refine (SR) and Quality Assessment (QA) Modules.

Existing approaches often rely on pre-segmented, within-activity data and overlook the physical layout of the environment, limiting their robustness in continuous, real-world deployments. In this paper, we propose MARAuder's Map, a novel framework for real-time activity recognition from raw, unsegmented sensor streams. Our method projects sensor activations onto the physical floorplan to generate trajectory-aware, image-like sequences that capture the spatial flow of human movement. These representations are processed by a hybrid deep learning model that jointly captures spatial structure and temporal dependencies. To enhance temporal awareness, we introduce a learnable time embedding module that encodes contextual cues such as hour-of-day and day-of-week. Additionally, an attention-based encoder selectively focuses on informative segments within each observation window, enabling accurate recognition even under cross-activity transitions and temporal ambiguity. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world smart home datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines, offering a practical solution for real-time HAR in ambient sensor environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMARAuder's Map\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u7269\u7406\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df7\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u667a\u80fd\u5bb6\u5c45\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u73af\u5883\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u57fa\u7840\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5206\u5272\u6570\u636e\u4e14\u5ffd\u7565\u7269\u7406\u73af\u5883\u5e03\u5c40\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u7269\u7406\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u611f\u77e5\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8054\u5408\u6355\u6349\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u667a\u80fd\u5bb6\u5c45\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u73af\u5883\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We investigate how current state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) perform on this task by exploring different prompting strategies such as chain of thought reasoning, few-shot learning, and self-prompting.

To mitigate this, concept erasure methods have been developed to remove undesirable concepts from pre-trained models. However, existing methods remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can regenerate the erased content. Moreover, achieving robust erasure often degrades the model's generative quality for safe, unrelated concepts, creating a difficult trade-off between safety and performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Classifier-Guided Concept Erasure (CGCE), an efficient plug-and-play framework that provides robust concept erasure for diverse generative models without altering their original weights. CGCE uses a lightweight classifier operating on text embeddings to first detect and then refine prompts containing undesired concepts. This approach is highly scalable, allowing for multi-concept erasure by aggregating guidance from several classifiers. By modifying only unsafe embeddings at inference time, our method prevents harmful content generation while preserving the model's original quality on benign prompts. Extensive experiments show that CGCE achieves state-of-the-art robustness against a wide range of red-teaming attacks. Our approach also maintains high generative utility, demonstrating a superior balance between safety and performance. We showcase the versatility of CGCE through its successful application to various modern T2I and T2V models, establishing it as a practical and effective solution for safe generative AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCGCE\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5305\u542b\u4e0d\u826f\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u539f\u59cb\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u521b\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e5f\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9690\u60a3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u64e6\u9664\u5f80\u5f80\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "CGCE\u4f7f\u7528\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0a\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u5148\u68c0\u6d4b\u7136\u540e\u4f18\u5316\u5305\u542b\u4e0d\u826f\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u539f\u59cb\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4fee\u6539\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eCGCE\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u5404\u79cd\u7ea2\u961f\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "CGCE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u751f\u6210AI\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u73b0\u4ee3T2I\u548cT2V\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

Neural policies, however, tend to be over-parameterized and non-transparent, hindering their interpretability and deployability on resource-limited edge devices. This work presents SymLight, a priority function search framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for discovering inherently interpretable and deployable symbolic priority functions to serve as the TSC policies. The priority function, in particular, accepts traffic features as input and then outputs a priority for each traffic signal phase, which subsequently directs the phase transition. For effective search, we propose a concise yet expressive priority function representation. This helps mitigate the combinatorial explosion of the action space in MCTS. Additionally, a probabilistic structural rollout strategy is introduced to leverage structural patterns from previously discovered high-quality priority functions, guiding the rollout process. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate SymLight's superior performance across a range of baselines.

Conversely, smaller open-source models offer cost advantages but struggle with complex or multimodal queries. We introduce a unified, modular framework that intelligently routes each query - textual, multimodal, or complex - to the most fitting expert model, using a learned routing network that balances cost and quality. For vision tasks, we employ a two-stage open-source pipeline optimized for efficiency and reviving efficient classical vision components where they remain SOTA for sub-tasks.

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown great potential in this field, their ability to capture the intrinsic connections between explicit and implicit emotions remains limited. We propose a novel ERC training framework, PRC-Emo, which integrates Prompt engineering, demonstration Retrieval, and Curriculum learning, with the goal of exploring whether LLMs can effectively perceive emotions in conversational contexts. Specifically, we design emotion-sensitive prompt templates based on both explicit and implicit emotional cues to better guide the model in understanding the speaker's psychological states. We construct the first dedicated demonstration retrieval repository for ERC, which includes training samples from widely used datasets, as well as high-quality dialogue examples generated by LLMs and manually verified. Moreover, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy into the LoRA fine-tuning process, incorporating weighted emotional shifts between same-speaker and different-speaker utterances to assign difficulty levels to dialogue samples, which are then organized in an easy-to-hard training sequence.

The sensor pixels under each micro-lens receive light from a sub-aperture of the main lens. This enables the image sensor to capture both spatial information and the angular resolution of a scene point. This additional angular information is used to estimate the depth of a 3-D scene. The continuum of virtual viewpoints in light field data enables efficient depth estimation using Epipolar Line Images (EPIs) with robust occlusion handling. However, the trade-off between angular information and spatial information is very critical and depends on the focal position of the camera. To design, develop, implement, and test novel disparity-based light field depth estimation algorithms, the availability of suitable light field image datasets is essential. In this paper, a publicly available light field image dataset is introduced and thoroughly described. We have also demonstrated the effect of focal position on the disparity of a 3-D point as well as the shortcomings of the currently available light field dataset. The proposed dataset contains 285 light field images captured using a Lytro Illum LF camera and 13 synthetic LF images. The proposed dataset also comprises a synthetic dataset with similar disparity characteristics to those of a real light field camera.

In this setting, a learner repeatedly selects arms and observes reward vectors, aiming to maximize the reward for the highest-priority objective, then the next, and so on. While previous studies have primarily focused on regret minimization, this work bridges the gap between \\textit{regret minimization} and \\textit{best arm identification} under lexicographic preferences. We propose two elimination-based algorithms to address this joint objective. The first algorithm eliminates suboptimal arms sequentially, layer by layer, in accordance with the objective priorities, and achieves sample complexity and regret bounds comparable to those of the best single-objective algorithms.

SR-KI begins by encoding KBs into key-value pairs using a pretrained encoder, and injects them into LLMs' KV cache. Building on this representation, we employ a two-stage training paradigm: first locating a dedicated retrieval layer within the LLM, and then applying an attention-based loss at this layer to explicitly supervise attention toward relevant KB entries. Unlike traditional retrieval-augmented generation methods that rely heavily on the performance of external retrievers and multi-stage pipelines, SR-KI supports end-to-end inference by performing retrieval entirely within the models latent space. This design enables efficient compression of injected knowledge and facilitates dynamic knowledge updates. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SR-KI enables the integration of up to 40K KBs into a 7B LLM on a single A100 40GB GPU, and achieves strong retrieval performance, maintaining over 98% Recall@10 on the best-performing task and exceeding 88% on average across all tasks.

Analogous to how perceived facial age reflects an individual's health, the visual appearance of a city serves as its ``portrait\", encapsulating latent socio-economic and environmental characteristics. Recent studies have explored leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate textual knowledge into imagery-based urban region representation learning. However, two major challenges remain: i)~difficulty in aligning fine-grained visual features with long captions, and ii) suboptimal knowledge incorporation due to noise in LLM-generated captions. To address these issues, we propose a novel pre-training framework called UrbanLN that improves Urban region representation learning through Long-text awareness and Noise suppression. Specifically, we introduce an information-preserved stretching interpolation strategy that aligns long captions with fine-grained visual semantics in complex urban scenes. To effectively mine knowledge from LLM-generated captions and filter out noise, we propose a dual-level optimization strategy. At the data level, a multi-model collaboration pipeline automatically generates diverse and reliable captions without human intervention. At the model level, we employ a momentum-based self-distillation mechanism to generate stable pseudo-targets, facilitating robust cross-modal learning under noisy conditions.

However, existing methods face the problem of coarse-grained graph fusion. Specifically, current approaches typically generate a separate graph structure for each view and then perform weighted fusion of graph structures at the view level, which is a relatively rough strategy. To address this limitation, we present a novel Mixture of Ego-Graphs Contrastive Representation Learning (MoEGCL). It mainly consists of two modules. In particular, we propose an innovative Mixture of Ego-Graphs Fusion (MoEGF), which constructs ego graphs and utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts network to implement fine-grained fusion of ego graphs at the sample level, rather than the conventional view-level fusion. Additionally, we present the Ego Graph Contrastive Learning (EGCL) module to align the fused representation with the view-specific representation. The EGCL module enhances the representation similarity of samples from the same cluster, not merely from the same sample, further boosting fine-grained graph representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoEGCL achieves state-of-the-art results in deep multi-view clustering tasks.

We introduce a diagnostic that requires no additional training and uses only the forward pass to emit a binary accept or reject signal during agent execution. The method analyzes token graphs induced by attention and computes two spectral statistics in early layers, namely the high frequency energy ratio and spectral entropy. We formalize these signals, establish invariances, and provide finite sample estimators with uncertainty quantification. Under a two regime mixture assumption with a monotone likelihood ratio property, we show that a single threshold on the high frequency energy ratio is optimal in the Bayes sense for detecting context inconsistency. Empirically, the high frequency energy ratio exhibits robust bimodality during context verification across multiple model families, which enables gating decisions with overhead below one millisecond on our hardware and configurations. We demonstrate integration into retrieval augmented agent pipelines and discuss deployment as an inline safety monitor. The approach detects contamination while the model is still processing the text, before errors commit to the reasoning chain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684token\u56fe\u8c31\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5149\u8c31\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff08\u9ad8\u9891\u80fd\u91cf\u6bd4\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u71b5\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6267\u884c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u53d1\u51fa\u4e8c\u5143\u63a5\u53d7/\u62d2\u7edd\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u9519\u8bef\u6216\u5bf9\u6297\u8f93\u5165\u800c\u635f\u574f\uff0c\u800c\u4e8b\u540e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3a\u65f6\u5df2\u665a\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u9519\u8bef\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u524d\u5df2\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u9012\u5206\u6790\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684token\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u9891\u80fd\u91cf\u6bd4\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u71b5\u4e24\u4e2a\u5149\u8c31\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cc\u673a\u5236\u6df7\u5408\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u5355\u8c03\u4f3c\u7136\u6bd4\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5355\u4e00\u9608\u503c\u8fdb\u884c\u6700\u4f18\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u9ad8\u9891\u80fd\u91cf\u6bd4\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u53cc\u5cf0\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u4e8e1\u6beb\u79d2\u7684\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5185\u8054\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6587\u672c\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u6c61\u67d3\uff0c\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u63d0\u4ea4\u5230\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u4e4b\u524d\u8fdb\u884c\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u63a7\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, empirical results are mixed and often unreliable, particularly for typologically distant or low-resource languages (LRLs) compared to English. Moreover, word realignment tools often rely on high-quality parallel data, which can be scarce or noisy for many LRLs. In this work, we conduct an extensive empirical study to investigate whether realignment truly benefits from using all available languages, or if strategically selected subsets can offer comparable or even improved cross-lingual transfer, and study the impact on LRLs. Our controlled experiments show that realignment can be particularly effective for LRLs and that using carefully selected, linguistically diverse subsets can match full multilingual alignment, and even outperform it for unseen LRLs. This indicates that effective realignment does not require exhaustive language coverage and can reduce data collection overhead, while remaining both efficient and robust when guided by informed language selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7cbe\u5fc3\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5b50\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bcd\u5bf9\u9f50\u53ef\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u751a\u81f3\u4f18\u4e8e\u5168\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bcd\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u6539\u8fdb\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7c7b\u578b\u5b66\u8ddd\u79bb\u8f83\u8fdc\u6216\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u7684\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e14\u5f80\u5f80\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5e73\u884c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u8bb8\u591a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6765\u8bf4\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u662f\u5426\u4f7f\u7528\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u7cbe\u5fc3\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5b50\u96c6\u53ef\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8fc1\u79fb\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8bcd\u5bf9\u9f50\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u522b\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7cbe\u5fc3\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5b50\u96c6\u53ef\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u5168\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bcd\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u7a77\u5c3d\u6240\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u667a\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u9009\u62e9\u53ef\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) can specialize models but often triggers a ``seesaw'' between in-distribution gains and out-of-distribution robustness, especially for smaller models. To address these challenges, we introduce RedOne 2.0, an SNS-oriented LLM trained with a progressive, RL-prioritized post-training paradigm designed for rapid and stable adaptation. The pipeline consist in three stages: (1) Exploratory Learning on curated SNS corpora to establish initial alignment and identify systematic weaknesses; (2) Targeted Fine-Tuning that selectively applies SFT to the diagnosed gaps while mixing a small fraction of general data to mitigate forgetting; and (3) Refinement Learning that re-applies RL with SNS-centric signals to consolidate improvements and harmonize trade-offs across tasks. Across various tasks spanning three categories, our 4B scale model delivers an average improvements about 2.41 over the 7B sub-optimal baseline.

While deep learning methods have shown promise in SAR despeckling, most methods employ a single unified network to process the entire image, failing to account for the distinct speckle statistics associated with different spatial physical characteristics. It often leads to artifacts, blurred edges, and texture distortion. To address these issues, we propose SAR-FAH, a frequency-adaptive heterogeneous despeckling model based on a divide-and-conquer architecture. First, wavelet decomposition is used to separate the image into frequency sub-bands carrying different intrinsic characteristics. Inspired by their differing noise characteristics, we design specialized sub-networks for different frequency components. The tailored approach leverages statistical variations across frequencies, improving edge and texture preservation while suppressing noise. Specifically, for the low-frequency part, denoising is formulated as a continuous dynamic system via neural ordinary differential equations, ensuring structural fidelity and sufficient smoothness that prevents artifacts. For high-frequency sub-bands rich in edges and textures, we introduce an enhanced U-Net with deformable convolutions for noise suppression and enhanced features.

However, in many AI for social impact applications, the presence of an intervention that affects the outcome can bias the evaluation. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) randomly assign interventions, allowing data from the control group to be used for unbiased model evaluation. However, this approach is inefficient because it ignores data from the treatment group. Given the complexity and cost often associated with RCTs, making the most use of the data is essential. Thus, we investigate model evaluation strategies that leverage all data from an RCT. First, we theoretically quantify the estimation bias that arises from na\u00efvely aggregating performance estimates from treatment and control groups, and derive the condition under which this bias leads to incorrect model selection. Leveraging these theoretical insights, we propose nuisance parameter weighting (NPW), an unbiased model evaluation approach that reweights data from the treatment group to mimic the distributions of samples that would or would not experience the outcome under no intervention. Using synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed evaluation approach consistently yields better model selection than the standard approach, which ignores data from the treatment group, across various intervention effect and sample size settings.

Existing approaches often combine distillation and quantization, but most post-training quantization (PTQ) methods are task-agnostic, ignoring how task-specific signals are distributed across layers. In this work, we propose to use hidden representations that encode task-salient signals as a guideline for quantization. In order to fully utilize our innovative idea, this paper compares two new task-aware PTQ methods: Task-Aware Quantization (TAQ), which allocates bitwidths using task-conditioned statistics from hidden activations, and TAQO, which allocates precision based on direct layer sensitivity tests. From a small calibration set, these approaches identify task-relevant layers, preserving their precision while aggressively quantizing the rest. This yields stable task sensitivity profiles and efficient task-specialized models. Across models, TAQ and TAQO outperform the baselines; TAQ leads on Phi-4, while TAQO leads on Llama-3.1, Qwen3, and Qwen2.5.

While traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods focus on feature attribution or post-hoc interpretation, the proposed framework integrates LLMs into defined decision models such as Question-Option-Criteria (QOC), Sensitivity Analysis, Game Theory, and Risk Management. By situating LLM reasoning within these formal structures, the approach transforms opaque inference into transparent and auditable decision traces. A layered architecture is presented that separates the reasoning space of the LLM from the explainable process space above it.

However, the reduced numerical precision of FP8 poses challenges for stable and accurate training. Current frameworks preserve training performance using mixed-granularity quantization, i.e., applying per-group quantization for activations and per-tensor/block quantization for weights. While effective, per-group quantization requires scaling along the inner dimension of matrix multiplication, introducing additional dequantization overhead. Moreover, these frameworks often rely on just-in-time scaling to dynamically adjust scaling factors based on the current data distribution. However, this online quantization is inefficient for FP8 training, as it involves multiple memory reads and writes that negate the performance benefits of FP8. To overcome these limitations, we propose MOSS, a novel FP8 training framework that ensures both efficiency and numerical stability. MOSS introduces two key innovations: (1) a two-level microscaling strategy for quantizing sensitive activations, which balances precision and dequantization cost by combining a high-precision global scale with compact, power-of-two local scales; and (2) automatic scaling for weights in linear layers, which eliminates the need for costly max-reduction operations by predicting and adjusting scaling factors during training. Leveraging these techniques, MOSS enables efficient FP8 training of a 7B parameter model, achieving performance comparable to the BF16 baseline while achieving up to 34% higher training throughput.", "AI": {"tldr": "MOSS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684FP8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u7ea7\u5fae\u7f29\u653e\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u6743\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f7f7B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u534734%\u3002", "motivation": "FP8\u683c\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u964d\u4f4e\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6784\u6210\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u7c92\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u53cd\u91cf\u5316\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u5728\u7ebf\u91cf\u5316\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMOSS\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4e24\u7ea7\u5fae\u7f29\u653e\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5168\u5c40\u7f29\u653e\u548c\u7d27\u51d1\u76842\u6b21\u5e42\u5c40\u90e8\u7f29\u653e\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u654f\u611f\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff1b2\uff09\u7ebf\u6027\u5c42\u6743\u91cd\u81ea\u52a8\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u8c03\u6574\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u907f\u514d\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6700\u5927\u7f29\u51cf\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "MOSS\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec37B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0eBF16\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe34%\u3002", "conclusion": "MOSS\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86FP8\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce RefineLab, the first LLM-driven framework that automatically refines raw QA textual data into high-quality datasets under a controllable token-budget constraint. RefineLab takes a set of target quality attributes (such as coverage and difficulty balance) as refinement objectives, and performs selective edits within a predefined token budget to ensure practicality and efficiency. In essence, RefineLab addresses a constrained optimization problem: improving the quality of QA samples as much as possible while respecting resource limitations. With a set of available refinement operations (e.g., rephrasing, distractor replacement), RefineLab takes as input the original dataset, a specified set of target quality dimensions, and a token budget, and determines which refinement operations should be applied to each QA sample. This process is guided by an assignment module that selects optimal refinement strategies to maximize overall dataset quality while adhering to the budget constraint.

To address this, we propose a unified framework for Open-World 3D Scene Graph Generation with Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning, which enables generalizable and interactive 3D scene understanding. Our method integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with retrieval-based reasoning to support multimodal exploration and language-guided interaction. The framework comprises two key components: (1) a dynamic scene graph generation module that detects objects and infers semantic relationships without fixed label sets, and (2) a retrieval-augmented reasoning pipeline that encodes scene graphs into a vector database to support text/image-conditioned queries. We evaluate our method on 3DSSG and Replica benchmarks across four tasks-scene question answering, visual grounding, instance retrieval, and task planning-demonstrating robust generalization and superior performance in diverse environments.

One of the major challenges of MoE models is that they usually require much more memory than their dense counterparts due to their unique architecture, and hence are harder to deploy in environments with limited GPU memory, such as edge devices. MoE offloading is a promising technique proposed to overcome this challenge, especially if it is enhanced with caching and pre-fetching, but prior work stopped at suboptimal caching algorithm and offered limited insights. In this work, we study MoE offloading in depth and make the following contributions: 1. We analyze the expert activation and LRU caching behavior in detail and provide traces. 2. We propose LFU caching optimization based on our analysis and obtain strong improvements from LRU. 3. We implement and experiment speculative expert pre-fetching, providing detailed trace showing its huge potential . 4. In addition, our study extensively covers the behavior of the MoE architecture itself, offering information on the characteristic of the gating network and experts.

This is in part due to the unavailability of textual data in these languages to train and apply NLP algorithms. In this work, we introduce ibom -- a dataset for machine translation and topic classification in four Coastal Nigerian languages from the Akwa Ibom State region: Anaang, Efik, Ibibio, and Oro. These languages are not represented in Google Translate or in major benchmarks such as Flores-200 or SIB-200. We focus on extending Flores-200 benchmark to these languages, and further align the translated texts with topic labels based on SIB-200 classification dataset. Our evaluation shows that current LLMs perform poorly on machine translation for these languages in both zero-and-few shot settings.

Combining definition, lifecycle processes, hardware strategies, and calibrated measurement, this article offers actionable, evidence based guidance for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7eff\u8272AI\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u786c\u4ef6\u3001\u5f00\u53d1\u3001\u90e8\u7f72\u3001\u91cd\u7528\u548c\u9000\u5f79\u7684\u4e94\u9636\u6bb5\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5236\u5b9a\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u4f30\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6d4b\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u51cf\u5c11AI\u7684\u73af\u5883\u8d1f\u62c5\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\u7684\u73af\u5883\u8d1f\u62c5\uff08\u80fd\u6e90\u3001\u78b3\u3001\u6c34\u3001\u9690\u542b\u5f71\u54cd\uff09\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u900f\u660e\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u5f02\u8d28\u4e14\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u6c34\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u94fe\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u7eff\u8272AI\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5236\u5b9a\u4e94\u9636\u6bb5\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u6620\u5c04\u5230LCA\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7PDCA\u5faa\u73af\u8fdb\u884c\u6cbb\u7406\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u7ed3\u5408\u4f30\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6d4b\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u7684\u7eff\u8272AI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u6d41\u7a0b\u3001\u786c\u4ef6\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u80fd\u6e90\u3001\u78b3\u3001\u6c34\u548c\u9690\u542b\u5f71\u54cd\u6210\u4e3a\u9996\u8981\u8003\u8651\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u3001\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u51cf\u5c11AI\u7684\u73af\u5883\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7eff\u8272AI\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose Gradient-Aware Balanced Feature Fusion (GABFusion), which dynamically balances gradient magnitudes and fuses task-specific features in a quantization-friendly manner. We further introduce Attention Distribution Alignment (ADA), a feature-level distillation strategy tailored for quantized models. Our method demonstrates strong generalization across network architectures and QAT algorithms, with theoretical guarantees on gradient bias reduction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our strategy consistently enhances a variety of QAT methods across different network architectures and bit-widths. On PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets, the proposed approach achieves average mAP improvements of approximately 3.3% and 1.6%, respectively. When applied to YOLOv5 under 4-bit quantization, our method narrows the accuracy gap with the full-precision model to only 1.7% on VOC, showcasing its effectiveness in preserving performance under low-bit constraints.

Experiments on various model combinations (Llama-3.1-8B, Gemma-7B, Mistral-7B-v0.1, Llama-3.2-3B) demonstrate that, on average, over half of the information in 16-token sequences can be recovered from this compressed representation while maintaining strong semantic integrity and coherence.

In a nutshell, the idea is to assign each interpretation a cost based upon the weights of the violated axioms and assertions, and certain and possible query answers are determined by considering all (resp. some) interpretations having optimal or bounded cost. Whereas the initial study of cost-based semantics focused on DLs between $\\mathcal{EL}_\\bot$ and $\\mathcal{ALCO}$, we consider DLs that may contain inverse roles and role inclusions, thus covering prominent DL-Lite dialects. Our data complexity analysis goes significantly beyond existing results by sharpening several lower bounds and pinpointing the precise complexity of optimal-cost certain answer semantics (no non-trivial upper bound was known). Moreover, while all existing results show the intractability of cost-based semantics, our most challenging and surprising result establishes that if we consider $\\text{DL-Lite}^\\mathcal{H}_\\mathsf{bool}$ ontologies and a fixed cost bound, certain answers for instance queries and possible answers for conjunctive queries can be computed using first-order rewriting and thus enjoy the lowest possible data complexity ($\\mathsf{TC}_0$).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u52a0\u6743\u63cf\u8ff0\u903b\u8f91\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u5305\u542b\u9006\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u5305\u542b\u7684DL-Lite\u65b9\u8a00\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u6210\u672c\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0b\u67d0\u4e9b\u67e5\u8be2\u5177\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u610f\u5916\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728EL\u22a5\u5230ALCO\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u4e14\u6240\u6709\u73b0\u6709\u7ed3\u679c\u90fd\u663e\u793a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u662f\u96be\u5904\u7406\u7684\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u8303\u56f4\u5230\u5305\u542b\u9006\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u5305\u542b\u7684DL-Lite\u65b9\u8a00\uff0c\u5e76\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89e3\u91ca\u5206\u914d\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fdd\u53cd\u516c\u7406\u548c\u65ad\u8a00\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u6240\u6709\uff08\u6216\u67d0\u4e9b\uff09\u5177\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u6216\u6709\u754c\u6210\u672c\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u67e5\u8be2\u7b54\u6848\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u9636\u91cd\u5199\u6280\u672f\u6765\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u51e0\u4e2a\u4e0b\u754c\u5e76\u7cbe\u786e\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u6210\u672c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b54\u6848\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002\u6700\u4ee4\u4eba\u60ca\u8bb6\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\uff1a\u5bf9\u4e8eDL-Lite^H_bool\u672c\u4f53\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u6210\u672c\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b54\u6848\u548c\u8fde\u63a5\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u7b54\u6848\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u9636\u91cd\u5199\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4eab\u6709\u6700\u4f4e\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6(TC_0)\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u7684DL-Lite\u65b9\u8a00\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u6210\u672c\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Existing analyses are insufficiently comprehensive and lack examination covering visual and textual tokens, model components, and the full range of layers. This limitation restricts actionable insights to improve the faithfulness of model output and the development of downstream tasks, such as hallucination mitigation. To address this limitation, we introduce Fine-grained Cross-modal Causal Tracing (FCCT) framework, which systematically quantifies the causal effects on visual object perception. FCCT conducts fine-grained analysis covering the full range of visual and textual tokens, three core model components including multi-head self-attention (MHSA), feed-forward networks (FFNs), and hidden states, across all decoder layers. Our analysis is the first to demonstrate that MHSAs of the last token in middle layers play a critical role in aggregating cross-modal information, while FFNs exhibit a three-stage hierarchical progression for the storage and transfer of visual object representations. Building on these insights, we propose Intermediate Representation Injection (IRI), a training-free inference-time technique that reinforces visual object information flow by precisely intervening on cross-modal representations at specific components and layers, thereby enhancing perception and mitigating hallucination. Consistent improvements across five widely used benchmarks and LVLMs demonstrate IRI achieves state-of-the-art performance, while preserving inference speed and other foundational performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FCCT\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86IRI\u6280\u672f\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u8c61\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u591f\u5168\u9762\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u6807\u8bb0\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u53ca\u6240\u6709\u5c42\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u56e0\u679c\u8ffd\u8e2a(FCCT)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u91cf\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u8c61\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u6ce8\u5165(IRI)\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u5e72\u9884\u7279\u5b9a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c\u5c42\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u6539\u8fdb\uff0cIRI\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7840\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "FCCT\u9996\u6b21\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u7684\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\u7684MHSA\u5728\u805a\u5408\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caFFNs\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u8c61\u8868\u793a\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u5c42\u6b21\u8fdb\u5c55\uff1bIRI\u6280\u672f\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

The research compares three scenarios: fully manual (human-only), AI-assisted (human-in-the-loop, HITL), and an advanced multi-agent agentic AI workflow leveraging parsers and verifiers. Empirical results show that AI-assisted HITL and agentic AI scenarios achieve reductions of up to 70-90% in energy consumption, 90-97% in carbon dioxide emissions, and 89-98% in water usage compared to manual processes. Notably, full agentic configurations, combining advanced reasoning (thinking mode) and multi-agent validation, achieve substantial sustainability gains over human-only approaches, even when resource usage increases slightly versus simpler AI-assisted solutions. The framework integrates performance, energy, and emission indicators into a unified ESG-oriented methodology for assessing and governing AI-enabled supply chain solutions.

Meanwhile, ViT in MAE suffers from inefficient parameter use due to fixed spatial resolution across layers. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Complementary Masked Autoencoders (CoMA), which employ a complementary masking strategy to ensure uniform sampling across all pixels, thereby improving effective learning of all features and enhancing the model's adaptability. Furthermore, we introduce DyViT, a hierarchical vision transformer that employs a Dynamic Multi-Window Self-Attention (DM-MSA), significantly reducing the parameters and FLOPs while improving fine-grained feature learning.

However, while these models implicitly compress historical information into their parameters during training, they are unable to explicitly and dynamically access this global knowledge during inference, relying only on the local context within the lookback window. This results in an underutilization of rich patterns from the global history. To bridge this gap, we propose Predicting the Future by Retrieving the Past (PFRP), a novel approach that explicitly integrates global historical data to enhance forecasting accuracy. Specifically, we construct a Global Memory Bank (GMB) to effectively store and manage global historical patterns. A retrieval mechanism is then employed to extract similar patterns from the GMB, enabling the generation of global predictions. By adaptively combining these global predictions with the outputs of any local prediction model, PFRP produces more accurate and interpretable forecasts. Extensive experiments conducted on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that PFRP significantly enhances the average performance of advanced univariate forecasting models by 8.4\\%.

We evaluated these models on 170 clinical cases, each synthesized into speech from 36 distinct voice profiles spanning variations in age, gender, and emotion. Our findings reveal a severe modality bias: surgical recommendations for audio inputs varied by as much as 35% compared to identical text-based inputs, with one model providing 80% fewer recommendations. Further analysis uncovered age disparities of up to 12% between young and elderly voices, which persisted in most models despite chain-of-thought prompting. While explicit reasoning successfully eliminated gender bias, the impact of emotion was not detected due to poor recognition performance. These results demonstrate that audio LLMs are susceptible to making clinical decisions based on a patient's voice characteristics rather than medical evidence, a flaw that risks perpetuating healthcare disparities.

However, the practical deployment of existing methods is hindered by two key challenges: the prohibitive computational cost of over-parameterized models and the suboptimal performance of conventional loss functions on the highly skewed distribution of urban flows. To address these challenges, we propose a unified solution that synergizes architectural efficiency with adaptive optimization. Specifically, we first introduce PLGF, a lightweight yet powerful architecture that employs a Progressive Local-Global Fusion strategy to effectively capture both fine-grained details and global contextual dependencies. Second, we propose DualFocal Loss, a novel function that integrates dual-space supervision with a difficulty-aware focusing mechanism, enabling the model to adaptively concentrate on hard-to-predict regions. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world scenarios validate the effectiveness and scalability of our method. Notably, while achieving state-of-the-art performance, PLGF reduces the model size by up to 97% compared to current high-performing methods. Furthermore, under comparable parameter budgets, our model yields an accuracy improvement of over 10% against strong baselines.

Recent generative modeling approaches have attempted to capture progression by mapping images into a latent representational space and then controlling and guiding the representations to generate follow-up images from a baseline image. However, existing approaches impose constraints on distribution learning, leading to latent spaces with limited controllability to generate follow-up images without explicit supervision from subject-specific longitudinal images. In order to enable controlled movements in the latent representational space and generate progression images from a baseline image in an unsupervised manner, we introduce a conditionable Diffusion Auto-encoder framework. The explicit encoding mechanism of image-diffusion auto-encoders forms a compact latent space capturing high-level semantics, providing means to disentangle information relevant for progression. Our approach leverages this latent space to condition and apply controlled shifts to baseline representations for generating follow-up. Controllability is induced by restricting these shifts to a subspace, thereby isolating progression-related factors from subject identity-preserving components. The shifts are implicitly guided by correlating with progression attributes, without requiring subject-specific longitudinal supervision. We validate the generations through image quality metrics, volumetric progression analysis, and downstream classification in Alzheimer's disease datasets from two different sources and disease categories.

While recent deep learning approaches have achieved strong performance on single EEG emotion datasets, their generalization across datasets remains limited due to the heterogeneity in annotation schemes and data formats. Existing models typically require dataset-specific architectures tailored to input structure and lack semantic alignment across diverse emotion labels. To address these challenges, we propose EMOD: A Unified EEG Emotion Representation Framework Leveraging Valence-Arousal (V-A) Guided Contrastive Learning. EMOD learns transferable and emotion-aware representations from heterogeneous datasets by bridging both semantic and structural gaps. Specifically, we project discrete and continuous emotion labels into a unified V-A space and formulate a soft-weighted supervised contrastive loss that encourages emotionally similar samples to cluster in the latent space. To accommodate variable EEG formats, EMOD employs a flexible backbone comprising a Triple-Domain Encoder followed by a Spatial-Temporal Transformer, enabling robust extraction and integration of temporal, spectral, and spatial features.

Establishing a conceptual bridge among these domains could enable each to benefit from the others. This paper proposes duality-based mode operations (split-unite, forward-backward, expansion-reduction and orthogonal dualities) to expand the set of rhetorical modes, introducing generated modes like combination and generalization, thereby enhancing epistemic diversity across multiple applications. It further presents a pyramid multilayer mapping framework (e.g., three layers from the rhetorical model layer, to cognitive layer, and to epistemic layers) that reduces the resulting cognitive complexity. The degrees of expressive diversity and complexity reduction are quantified through binomial combinatorics and Shannon entropy analysis. A Marginal Rhetorical Bit (MRB) is identified, permitting the definition of a rhetorical-scalable parameter that measures expressive growth speed in bits per stage. A direct entropy measure shows that hierarchical selection over smaller subsets markedly reduces choice uncertainty compared with flat selection across all modes. These considerations appear to transform static and non-measurable rhetorical taxonomies into more dynamic and more measurable systems for discourse design. From this work, it would be possible to identify a pathway for future AI systems to operate not only on language tokens but on layered rhetorical reasoning structures, bridging linguistic, pedagogical, academic, and computational research", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u5076\u6027\u7684\u4fee\u8f9e\u6a21\u5f0f\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u91d1\u5b57\u5854\u591a\u5c42\u6620\u5c04\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u9759\u6001\u4fee\u8f9e\u5206\u7c7b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5206\u5c42\u4fee\u8f9e\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u8def\u5f84", "motivation": "\u5efa\u7acb\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5efa\u6a21\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u4f7f\u5404\u9886\u57df\u80fd\u591f\u76f8\u4e92\u53d7\u76ca\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u591a\u6837\u6027", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u5076\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u64cd\u4f5c\uff08\u5206\u88c2-\u8054\u5408\u3001\u524d\u5411-\u540e\u5411\u3001\u6269\u5c55-\u7f29\u51cf\u548c\u6b63\u4ea4\u5bf9\u5076\u6027\uff09\u6765\u6269\u5c55\u4fee\u8f9e\u6a21\u5f0f\u96c6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u91d1\u5b57\u5854\u591a\u5c42\u6620\u5c04\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u4fee\u8f9e\u6a21\u578b\u5c42\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c42\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c42\u4e09\u5c42\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u9879\u7ec4\u5408\u5b66\u548c\u9999\u519c\u71b5\u5206\u6790\u91cf\u5316\u8868\u8fbe\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u51cf\u5c11", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u8fb9\u9645\u4fee\u8f9e\u6bd4\u7279\uff08MRB\uff09\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u8861\u91cf\u8868\u8fbe\u589e\u957f\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u4fee\u8f9e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5206\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u76f8\u6bd4\u5e73\u9762\u9009\u62e9\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u9759\u6001\u4e0d\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u4fee\u8f9e\u5206\u7c7b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u66f4\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u8bed\u7bc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5206\u5c42\u4fee\u8f9e\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u8def\u5f84"}}

While there are extensive researches on detecting model generated text, we find that these existing methods are not applicable to time series data due to the fundamental modality difference, as time series usually have lower information density and smoother probability distributions than text data, which limit the discriminative power of token-based detectors. To address this issue, we examine the subtle distributional differences between real and model-generated time series and propose the contraction hypothesis, which states that model-generated time series, unlike real ones, exhibit progressively decreasing uncertainty under recursive forecasting. We formally prove this hypothesis under theoretical assumptions on model behavior and time series structure. Model-generated time series exhibit progressively concentrated distributions under recursive forecasting, leading to uncertainty contraction. We provide empirical validation of the hypothesis across diverse datasets. Building on this insight, we introduce the Uncertainty Contraction Estimator (UCE), a white-box detector that aggregates uncertainty metrics over successive prefixes to identify TSLM-generated time series. Extensive experiments on 32 datasets show that UCE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a reliable and generalizable solution for detecting model-generated time series.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5728\u9012\u5f52\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f1a\u9010\u6e10\u6536\u7f29\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6536\u7f29\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff08UCE\uff09\u6765\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u5408\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6570\u636e\u6ee5\u7528\u548c\u4f2a\u9020\u98ce\u9669\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u68c0\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\u3001\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6536\u7f29\u5047\u8bf4\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5728\u9012\u5f52\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4f1a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9010\u6e10\u51cf\u5c11\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86UCE\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u5408\u8fde\u7eed\u524d\u7f00\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6307\u6807\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u5408\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u572832\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cUCE\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u786e\u5b9e\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6536\u7f29\u7279\u6027\uff0cUCE\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6d1e\u5bdf\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u5408\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing OVSGG methods always adopt a two-stage pipeline: 1) \\textit{Infusing knowledge} into large-scale models via pre-training on large datasets; 2) \\textit{Transferring knowledge} from pre-trained models with fully annotated scene graphs during supervised fine-tuning. However, due to a lack of explicit interaction modeling, these methods struggle to distinguish between interacting and non-interacting instances of the same object category. This limitation induces critical issues in both stages of OVSGG: it generates noisy pseudo-supervision from mismatched objects during knowledge infusion, and causes ambiguous query matching during knowledge transfer. To this end, in this paper, we propose an inter\\textbf{AC}tion-\\textbf{C}entric end-to-end OVSGG framework (\\textbf{ACC}) in an interaction-driven paradigm to minimize these mismatches. For \\textit{interaction-centric knowledge infusion}, ACC employs a bidirectional interaction prompt for robust pseudo-supervision generation to enhance the model's interaction knowledge. For \\textit{interaction-centric knowledge transfer}, ACC first adopts interaction-guided query selection that prioritizes pairing interacting objects to reduce interference from non-interacting ones. Then, it integrates interaction-consistent knowledge distillation to bolster robustness by pushing relational foreground away from the background while retaining general knowledge.

This paper investigates the application of TabPFN in Combinatorial Optimization (CO) problems. The aim is to lessen challenges in time and data-intensive training requirements often observed in using traditional methods including exact and heuristic algorithms, Machine Learning (ML)-based models, to solve CO problems. Proposing possibly the first ever application of TabPFN for such a purpose, we adapt and fine-tune the TabPFN model to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), one of the most well-known CO problems. Specifically, we adopt the node-based approach and the node-predicting adaptation strategy to construct the entire TSP route. Our evaluation with varying instance sizes confirms that TabPFN requires minimal training, adapts to TSP using a single sample, performs better generalization across varying TSP instance sizes, and reduces performance degradation. Furthermore, the training process with adaptation and fine-tuning is completed within minutes. The methodology leads to strong solution quality even without post-processing and achieves performance comparable to other models with post-processing refinement.

While this is often said jokingly, the light-hearted remark reflects a deeper concern. How can we be certain that an online post flagged as \"inappropriate\" was not simply the victim of a biased algorithm? This paper investigates this problem using a dual approach. First, I conduct a quantitative benchmark of a widely used toxicity model (unitary/toxic-bert) to measure performance disparity between text in African-American English (AAE) and Standard American English (SAE). The benchmark reveals a clear, systematic bias: on average, the model scores AAE text as 1.8 times more toxic and 8.8 times higher for \"identity hate\". Second, I introduce an interactive pedagogical tool that makes these abstract biases tangible. The tool's core mechanic, a user-controlled \"sensitivity threshold,\" demonstrates that the biased score itself is not the only harm; instead, the more-concerning harm is the human-set, seemingly neutral policy that ultimately operationalises discrimination.

Current alignment efforts primarily target explicit risks such as bias, hate speech, and violence. However, they often fail to address deeper, domain-specific implicit risks and lack a flexible, generalizable framework applicable across diverse specialized fields. Hence, we proposed MENTOR: A MEtacognition-driveN self-evoluTion framework for uncOvering and mitigating implicit Risks in LLMs on Domain Tasks. To address the limitations of labor-intensive human evaluation, we introduce a novel metacognitive self-assessment tool. This enables LLMs to reflect on potential value misalignments in their responses using strategies like perspective-taking and consequential thinking. We also release a supporting dataset of 9,000 risk queries spanning education, finance, and management to enhance domain-specific risk identification. Subsequently, based on the outcomes of metacognitive reflection, the framework dynamically generates supplementary rule knowledge graphs that extend predefined static rule trees. This enables models to actively apply validated rules to future similar challenges, establishing a continuous self-evolution cycle that enhances generalization by reducing maintenance costs and inflexibility of static systems. Finally, we employ activation steering during inference to guide LLMs in following the rules, a cost-effective method to robustly enhance enforcement across diverse contexts. Experimental results show MENTOR's effectiveness: In defensive testing across three vertical domains, the framework substantially reduces semantic attack success rates, enabling a new level of implicit risk mitigation for LLMs. Furthermore, metacognitive assessment not only aligns closely with baseline human evaluators but also delivers more thorough and insightful analysis of LLMs value alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "MENTOR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u7f13\u89e3LLMs\u5728\u9886\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5219\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u751f\u6210\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u9690\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5bf9\u9f50\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u663e\u6027\u98ce\u9669\uff08\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u3001\u66b4\u529b\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5f80\u5f80\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u9690\u6027\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "1) \u5f15\u5165\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8ba9LLMs\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89d2\u8f6c\u6362\u548c\u540e\u679c\u601d\u8003\u7b49\u7b56\u7565\u53cd\u601d\u5176\u56de\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4ef7\u503c\u504f\u5dee\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u53cd\u601d\u7ed3\u679c\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u8865\u5145\u89c4\u5219\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u9759\u6001\u89c4\u5219\u6811\uff1b3) \u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u6765\u6307\u5bfcLLMs\u9075\u5faa\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMENTOR\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u4e3aLLMs\u7684\u9690\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u6df1\u5165\u7684LLMs\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "MENTOR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u9886\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6301\u7eed\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u9759\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7ef4\u62a4\u6210\u672c\u548c\u50f5\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

To alleviate the above issues, we proposed a novel global multiple extraction network (GME-Net) for low-resolution facial expression recognition, which incorporates 1) a hybrid attention-based local feature extraction module with attention similarity knowledge distillation to learn image details from high-resolution network; 2) a multi-scale global feature extraction module with quasi-symmetric structure to mitigate the influence of local image noise and facilitate capturing global image features. As a result, our GME-Net is capable of extracting expression-related discriminative features.

One of the key problems in this task is the lack of sufficient labeled logs, which limits the rapid deployment in new systems. Existing works usually leverage large-scale labeled logs from a mature web system and a small amount of labeled logs from a new system, using transfer learning to extract and generalize general knowledge across both domains. However, these methods focus solely on the transfer of general knowledge and neglect the disparity and potential mismatch between such knowledge and the proprietary knowledge of target system, thus constraining performance. To address this limitation, we propose FusionLog, a novel zero-label cross-system log-based anomaly detection method that effectively achieves the fusion of general and proprietary knowledge, enabling cross-system generalization without any labeled target logs. Specifically, we first design a training-free router based on semantic similarity that dynamically partitions unlabeled target logs into 'general logs' and 'proprietary logs.' For general logs, FusionLog employs a small model based on system-agnostic representation meta-learning for direct training and inference, inheriting the general anomaly patterns shared between the source and target systems. For proprietary logs, we iteratively generate pseudo-labels and fine-tune the small model using multi-round collaborative knowledge distillation and fusion based on large language model (LLM) and small model (SM) to enhance its capability to recognize anomaly patterns specific to the target system.

In this paper, we propose the dialect refinement (DIA-REFINE) framework, which guides LLMs toward faithful target dialect outputs through an iterative loop of translation, verification, and feedback using external dialect classifiers. To address the limitations of n-gram-based metrics, we introduce the dialect fidelity score (DFS) to quantify linguistic shift and the target dialect ratio (TDR) to measure the success of dialect translation. Experiments on Korean dialects across zero-shot and in-context learning baselines demonstrate that DIA-REFINE consistently enhances dialect fidelity. The proposed metrics distinguish between False Success cases, where high n-gram scores obscure failures in dialectal translation, and True Attempt cases, where genuine attempts at dialectal translation yield low n-gram scores. We also observed that models exhibit varying degrees of responsiveness to the framework, and that integrating in-context examples further improves the translation of dialectal expressions.

With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), more and more attempts are being made to apply LLMs to financial areas. A simple, direct application of LLM as an agent shows significant performance. Such methods are hindered by their slow inference speed, while most of the current research has not studied LLM distillation for this specific task. To address this, we first propose the normalized fluorescent probe to study the mechanism of the LLM's feature. Based on the observation found by our investigation, we propose Cooperative Market Making (CMM), a novel framework that decouples LLM features across three orthogonal dimensions: layer, task, and data. Various student models collaboratively learn simple LLM features along with different dimensions, with each model responsible for a distinct feature to achieve knowledge distillation. Furthermore, CMM introduces an H\u00e1jek-MoE to integrate the output of the student models by investigating the contribution of different models in a kernel function-generated common feature space. Extensive experimental results on four real-world market datasets demonstrate the superiority of CMM over the current distillation method and RL-based market-making strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCMM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06LLM\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u5c42\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6570\u636e\u4e09\u4e2a\u6b63\u4ea4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165H\u00e1jek-MoE\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5e02\u573a\u505a\u5e02\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u505a\u5e02\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u9488\u5bf9\u6b64\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u884cLLM\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u63d0\u51fa\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u8367\u5149\u63a2\u9488\u7814\u7a76LLM\u7279\u5f81\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51faCMM\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6b63\u4ea4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u89e3\u8026LLM\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8ba9\u591a\u4e2a\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u4f7f\u7528H\u00e1jek-MoE\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u5e02\u573a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCMM\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eRL\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u505a\u5e02\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "CMM\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u5728\u5e02\u573a\u505a\u5e02\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Here we present the first application of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for hydrogen crossover prediction, integrating mass conservation, Fick's diffusion law, and Henry's solubility law within a compact architecture (17,793 parameters). Validated across six membranes under industrially relevant conditions (0.05-5.0 A/cm$^2$, 1-200 bar, 25-85\u00b0C), our PINN achieves exceptional accuracy (R$^2$ = 99.84%, RMSE = 0.0348%) with sub-millisecond inference times suitable for real-time control. Remarkably, the model maintains R$^2$ > 86% when predicting crossover at pressures 2.5x beyond training range-substantially outperforming pure neural networks (R$^2$ = 43.4%). The hardware-agnostic deployment, from desktop CPUs to edge devices (Raspberry Pi 4), enables distributed safety monitoring essential for gigawatt-scale installations.

Recent test-time methods leverage textual feedback to overcome this, but they often critique and revise a single candidate response, lacking a principled mechanism to systematically analyze, weigh, and synthesize the strengths of multiple promising candidates. Such a mechanism is crucial because different responses may excel in distinct aspects (e.g., clarity, factual accuracy, or tone), and combining their best elements may produce a far superior outcome. This paper proposes the Textual Self-Attention Network (TSAN), a new paradigm for test-time preference optimization that requires no parameter updates. TSAN emulates self-attention entirely in natural language to overcome this gap: it analyzes multiple candidates by formatting them into textual keys and values, weighs their relevance using an LLM-based attention module, and synthesizes their strengths into a new, preference-aligned response under the guidance of the learned textual attention. This entire process operates in a textual gradient space, enabling iterative and interpretable optimization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that with just three test-time iterations on a base SFT model, TSAN outperforms supervised models like Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and surpasses the current state-of-the-art test-time alignment method by effectively leveraging multiple candidate solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "TSAN\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u62df\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u591a\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u5e76\u5408\u6210\u66f4\u4f18\u7ed3\u679c", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u8bc4\u4f30\u5355\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6743\u8861\u548c\u7efc\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u54cd\u5e94\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u540c\u54cd\u5e94\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u3001\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6216\u8bed\u6c14\u7b49\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02", "method": "TSAN\u5b8c\u5168\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u6a21\u62df\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u5c06\u591a\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u54cd\u5e94\u683c\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u952e\u503c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6587\u672c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0b\u7efc\u5408\u4f18\u52bf\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u54cd\u5e94", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u7840SFT\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4ec5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e09\u6b21\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0cTSAN\u5c31\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct\u7b49\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "TSAN\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u6587\u672c\u68af\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u8fed\u4ee3\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u63d0\u5347LLM\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6"}}

This non-invasive method has gained traction across diverse domains, including telemedicine, affective computing, driver fatigue detection, and health monitoring, owing to its scalability and convenience. Despite significant progress in remote physiological signal measurement, a crucial characteristic - the intrinsic periodicity - has often been underexplored or insufficiently modeled in previous approaches, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained temporal dynamics under real-world conditions. To bridge this gap, we propose Reperio-rPPG, a novel framework that strategically integrates Relational Convolutional Networks with a Graph Transformer to effectively capture the periodic structure inherent in physiological signals. Additionally, recognizing the limited diversity of existing rPPG datasets, we further introduce a tailored CutMix augmentation to enhance the model's generalizability. Extensive experiments conducted on three widely used benchmark datasets - PURE, UBFC-rPPG, and MMPD - demonstrate that Reperio-rPPG not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also exhibits remarkable robustness under various motion (e.g., stationary, rotation, talking, walking) and illumination conditions (e.g., nature, low LED, high LED).

Framing the problem as a sequence-to-sequence task, we develop a permutation- and affine-equivariant transformer that estimates both the probability density $f(x)$ and its score $\\nabla_x \\log f(x)$ directly from i.i.d. samples. Unlike traditional score-matching methods that require training a separate model for each distribution, our approach learns a single distribution-agnostic operator that generalizes across densities and sample sizes. The architecture employs cross-attention to connect observed samples with arbitrary query points, enabling generalization beyond the training data, while built-in symmetry constraints ensure equivariance to permutation and affine transformations. Analytically, we show that the attention weights can recover classical kernel density estimation (KDE), and verify it empirically, establishing a principled link between classical KDE and the transformer architecture. Empirically, the model achieves substantially lower error and better scaling than KDE and score-debiased KDE (SD-KDE), while exhibiting better runtime scaling.

Large Language Models (LLMs) can be successfully leveraged to enhance Agent-Based Modeling and simulate human-like social behavior with unprecedented degree of believability.

We fill this gap by designing a LLM-powered simulator of OSN conversations enabling a parallel, counterfactual simulation where toxic behavior is influenced by moderation interventions, keeping all else equal.

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been widely adopted to address these limitations by supplementing model outputs with retrieved evidence. However, whether RAG reliably achieves these goals remains unclear. Here, we present the most comprehensive expert evaluation of RAG in medicine to date. Eighteen medical experts contributed a total of 80,502 annotations, assessing 800 model outputs generated by GPT-4o and Llama-3.1-8B across 200 real-world patient and USMLE-style queries. We systematically decomposed the RAG pipeline into three components: (i) evidence retrieval (relevance of retrieved passages), (ii) evidence selection (accuracy of evidence usage), and (iii) response generation (factuality and completeness of outputs). Contrary to expectation, standard RAG often degraded performance: only 22% of top-16 passages were relevant, evidence selection remained weak (precision 41-43%, recall 27-49%), and factuality and completeness dropped by up to 6% and 5%, respectively, compared with non-RAG variants. Retrieval and evidence selection remain key failure points for the model, contributing to the overall performance drop. We further show that simple yet effective strategies, including evidence filtering and query reformulation, substantially mitigate these issues, improving performance on MedMCQA and MedXpertQA by up to 12% and 8.2%, respectively. These findings call for re-examining RAG's role in medicine and highlight the importance of stage-aware evaluation and deliberate system design for reliable medical LLM applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57dfRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6807\u51c6RAG\u53cd\u800c\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ec522%\u68c0\u7d22\u6bb5\u843d\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8bc1\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u51c6\u786e\u738741-43%\uff0c\u53ec\u56de\u738727-49%\uff0c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u8fbe6%\u548c5%\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLMs\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u8ddf\u4e0a\u5feb\u901f\u6f14\u53d8\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "18\u4f4d\u533b\u5b66\u4e13\u5bb6\u5bf9800\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u8fdb\u884c80,502\u6b21\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5c06RAG\u6d41\u7a0b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u8bc1\u636e\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u8bc1\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30GPT-4o\u548cLlama-3.1-8B\u5728200\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u60a3\u8005\u548cUSMLE\u5f0f\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u6807\u51c6RAG\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u8bc1\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u5931\u8d25\u70b9\u3002\u7b80\u5355\u7b56\u7565\u5982\u8bc1\u636e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u91cd\u6784\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728MedMCQA\u548cMedXpertQA\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u534712%\u548c8.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6RAG\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9636\u6bb5\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u7cbe\u5fc3\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u53ef\u9760\u533b\u5b66LLM\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

The core challenge of AHT is to develop an ego agent that can predict and adapt to unknown teammates on the fly. Conventional RL-based approaches optimize a single expected return, which often causes policies to collapse into a single dominant behavior, thus failing to capture the multimodal cooperation patterns inherent in AHT. In this work, we introduce PADiff, a diffusion-based approach that captures agent's multimodal behaviors, unlocking its diverse cooperation modes with teammates. However, standard diffusion models lack the ability to predict and adapt in highly non-stationary AHT scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a novel diffusion-based policy that integrates critical predictive information about teammates into the denoising process.

Consequently, they lack an inherent incentive to compress history into compact latent states with consistent transition rules. This often leads to learning solutions that generalize poorly. We introduce Next-Latent Prediction (NextLat), which extends standard next-token training with self-supervised predictions in the latent space. Specifically, NextLat trains a transformer to learn latent representations that are predictive of its next latent state given the next output token. Theoretically, we show that these latents provably converge to belief states, compressed information of the history necessary to predict the future. This simple auxiliary objective also injects a recurrent inductive bias into transformers, while leaving their architecture, parallel training, and inference unchanged. NextLat effectively encourages the transformer to form compact internal world models with its own belief states and transition dynamics -- a crucial property absent in standard next-token prediction transformers. Empirically, across benchmarks targeting core sequence modeling competencies -- world modeling, reasoning, planning, and language modeling -- NextLat demonstrates significant gains over standard next-token training in downstream accuracy, representation compression, and lookahead planning.

We systematically investigate the contamination sensitivity of 23 SLMs (270M to 4B parameters) across multiple model families by measuring susceptibility to syntactic and semantic transformation types during instruction tuning: syntactic transformations (character and word reversal) and semantic transformations (irrelevant and counterfactual responses), each applied at contamination levels of 25\\%, 50\\%, 75\\%, and 100\\%. Our results reveal fundamental asymmetries in vulnerability patterns: syntactic transformations cause catastrophic performance degradation, with character reversal producing near-complete failure across all models regardless of size or family, while semantic transformations demonstrate distinct threshold behaviors and greater resilience in core linguistic capabilities. Critically, we discover a ``\\textit{capability curse}\" where larger, more capable models become more susceptible to learning semantic corruptions, effectively following harmful instructions more readily, while our analysis of base versus instruction-tuned variants reveals that alignment provides inconsistent robustness benefits, sometimes even reducing resilience. Our work establishes three core contributions: (1) empirical evidence of SLMs' disproportionate vulnerability to syntactic pattern contamination, (2) identification of asymmetric sensitivity patterns between syntactic and semantic transformations, and (3) systematic evaluation protocols for contamination robustness assessment. These findings have immediate deployment implications, suggesting that current robustness assumptions may not hold for smaller models and highlighting the need for contamination-aware training protocols.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff1a\u53e5\u6cd5\u8f6c\u6362\u5bfc\u81f4\u707e\u96be\u6027\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800c\u8bed\u4e49\u8f6c\u6362\u663e\u793a\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u97e7\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u5bb3\u6307\u4ee4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f3023\u4e2a\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff082.7\u4ebf\u523040\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u5bf9\u53e5\u6cd5\u8f6c\u6362\uff08\u5b57\u7b26\u548c\u5355\u8bcd\u53cd\u8f6c\uff09\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u8f6c\u6362\uff08\u65e0\u5173\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u54cd\u5e94\uff09\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u6c61\u67d3\u6c34\u5e73\u5206\u522b\u4e3a25%\u300150%\u300175%\u548c100%\u3002", "result": "\u53e5\u6cd5\u8f6c\u6362\u5bfc\u81f4\u707e\u96be\u6027\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5b57\u7b26\u53cd\u8f6c\u51e0\u4e4e\u4f7f\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5b8c\u5168\u5931\u6548\uff1b\u8bed\u4e49\u8f6c\u6362\u663e\u793a\u9608\u503c\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u97e7\u6027\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\"\u80fd\u529b\u8bc5\u5492\"\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u4e49\u6c61\u67d3\uff1b\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u76ca\u5904\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u53e5\u6cd5\u6a21\u5f0f\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u8bc1\u636e\u3001\u53e5\u6cd5\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u654f\u611f\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6c61\u67d3\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

The framework integrates structured debate, retrieval-augmented method memory, and ensemble-guided evolutionary search, enabling the agents to generate and assess new hypotheses about architectures and optimization procedures. Across physics-informed learning and operator learning tasks, the framework discovers solution methods that outperform single-agent and human-designed baselines by up to four orders of magnitude in error reduction. The agents produce novel strategies -- including adaptive mixture-of-expert architectures, decomposition-based PINNs, and physics-informed operator learning models -- that do not appear explicitly in the curated knowledge base.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-modal registration framework composed of two key modules: the Iterative Agents Selection (IAS) module and the Reliable Agents Interaction (RAI) module. IAS enhances structural feature awareness with phase maps and employs reinforcement learning principles to efficiently select reliable agents. RAI then leverages these selected agents to guide cross-modal interactions, effectively reducing mismatches and improving overall robustness.

However, the widespread adoption of LLMs has raised critical privacy and security concerns. During interactions, LLMs may unintentionally expose confidential database contents or be manipulated by attackers to exfiltrate data through seemingly benign queries. While current efforts typically rely on rule-based heuristics or LLM agents to mitigate this leakage risk, these methods still struggle with complex inference-based attacks, suffer from high false positive rates, and often compromise the reliability of SQL queries. To address these challenges, we propose \\textsc{SafeNlidb}, a novel privacy-security alignment framework for LLM-based NLIDB. The framework features an automated pipeline that generates hybrid chain-of-thought interaction data from scratch, seamlessly combining implicit security reasoning with SQL generation. Additionally, we introduce reasoning warm-up and alternating preference optimization to overcome the multi-preference oscillations of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), enabling LLMs to produce security-aware SQL through fine-grained reasoning without the need for human-annotated preference data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms both larger-scale LLMs and ideal-setting baselines, achieving significant security improvements while preserving high utility.WARNING: This work may contain content that is offensive and harmful!", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SafeNlidb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6df7\u5408\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4ea4\u66ff\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5728NLIDB\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u63a5\u53e3\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u610f\u66b4\u9732\u673a\u5bc6\u6570\u636e\u6216\u88ab\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u4e14\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSafeNlidb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6df7\u5408\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u4ea4\u4e92\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u9884\u70ed\u548c\u4ea4\u66ff\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3LLM\u751f\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u611f\u77e5\u7684SQL\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u548c\u7406\u60f3\u8bbe\u7f6e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "SafeNlidb\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u5728NLIDB\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u63a8\u7406\u4e0eSQL\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

While prior work has focused on detection accuracy, it overlooks the importance of helping users understand the reasoning behind factual judgments and develop future resilience. The debate transcripts generated during MAD offer a rich but underutilized resource for transparent reasoning. In this study, we introduce ED2D, an evidence-based MAD framework that extends previous approach by incorporating factual evidence retrieval. More importantly, ED2D is designed not only as a detection framework but also as a persuasive multi-agent system aimed at correcting user beliefs and discouraging misinformation sharing. We compare the persuasive effects of ED2D-generated debunking transcripts with those authored by human experts. Results demonstrate that ED2D outperforms existing baselines across three misinformation detection benchmarks. When ED2D generates correct predictions, its debunking transcripts exhibit persuasive effects comparable to those of human experts; However, when ED2D misclassifies, its accompanying explanations may inadvertently reinforce users'misconceptions, even when presented alongside accurate human explanations. Our findings highlight both the promise and the potential risks of deploying MAD systems for misinformation intervention.

In few-shot settings, insufficient training samples often fail to cover the diverse patterns present in test samples. This challenge can be mitigated by extracting structural commonality from a small number of training samples. In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot unsupervised multimodal industrial anomaly detection method based on structural commonality, CIF (Commonality In Few). To extract intra-class structural information, we employ hypergraphs, which are capable of modeling higher-order correlations, to capture the structural commonality within training samples, and use a memory bank to store this intra-class structural prior. Firstly, we design a semantic-aware hypergraph construction module tailored for single-semantic industrial images, from which we extract common structures to guide the construction of the memory bank. Secondly, we use a training-free hypergraph message passing module to update the visual features of test samples, reducing the distribution gap between test features and features in the memory bank. We further propose a hyperedge-guided memory search module, which utilizes structural information to assist the memory search process and reduce the false positive rate. Experimental results on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset and the Eyecandies dataset show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in few-shot settings.

Resolving anomalies such as inference performance degradation or latency jitter in distributed system demands significant manual efforts from domain experts, resulting in extremely time-consuming diagnosis processes with relatively low accuracy. In this paper, we introduce Kunlun Anomaly Troubleshooter (KAT), the first anomaly troubleshooting framework tailored for LMDI. KAT addresses this problem through two core innovations. First, KAT exploits the synchronicity and consistency of GPU workers, innovatively leverages function trace data to precisely detect kernel-level anomalies and associated hardware components at nanosecond resolution. Second, KAT integrates these detection results into a domain-adapted LLM, delivering systematic causal reasoning and natural language interpretation of complex anomaly symptoms.

This sharpening enables the model to concentrate on the most relevant tokens while suppressing irrelevant ones. Empirically, Focal Attention scales more favorably than standard transformer with respect to model size, training data, and context length.

However, existing approaches rely on a mono-contextual paradigm that accumulates all information in a single, expanding context window, leading to context suffocation and noise contamination that limit their effectiveness on long-horizon tasks. We introduce IterResearch, a novel iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates long-horizon research as a Markov Decision Process with strategic workspace reconstruction. By maintaining an evolving report as memory and periodically synthesizing insights, our approach preserves consistent reasoning capacity across arbitrary exploration depths. We further develop Efficiency-Aware Policy Optimization (EAPO), a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes efficient exploration through geometric reward discounting and enables stable distributed training via adaptive downsampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IterResearch achieves substantial improvements over existing open-source agents with average +14.5pp across six benchmarks and narrows the gap with frontier proprietary systems. Remarkably, our paradigm exhibits unprecedented interaction scaling, extending to 2048 interactions with dramatic performance gains (from 3.5\\% to 42.5\\%), and serves as an effective prompting strategy, improving frontier models by up to 19.2pp over ReAct on long-horizon tasks.

Artificial intelligence may aid in pre-screening. Purpose: To evaluate the DINOv2-based Medical Slice Transformer (MST) for ruling out significant findings (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System [BI-RADS] >=4) in contrast-enhanced and non-contrast-enhanced abbreviated breast MRI. Materials and Methods: This institutional review board approved retrospective study included 1,847 single-breast MRI examinations (377 BI-RADS >=4) from an in-house dataset and 924 from an external validation dataset (Duke). Four abbreviated protocols were tested: T1-weighted early subtraction (T1sub), diffusion-weighted imaging with b=1500 s/mm2 (DWI1500), DWI1500+T2-weighted (T2w), and T1sub+T2w. Performance was assessed at 90%, 95%, and 97.5% sensitivity using five-fold cross-validation and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis. AUC differences were compared with the DeLong test. False negatives were characterized, and attention maps of true positives were rated in the external dataset. Results: A total of 1,448 female patients (mean age, 49 +/- 12 years) were included. T1sub+T2w achieved an AUC of 0.77 +/- 0.04; DWI1500+T2w, 0.74 +/- 0.04 (p=0.15). At 97.5% sensitivity, T1sub+T2w had the highest specificity (19% +/- 7%), followed by DWI1500+T2w (17% +/- 11%). Missed lesions had a mean diameter <10 mm at 95% and 97.5% thresholds for both T1sub and DWI1500, predominantly non-mass enhancements. External validation yielded an AUC of 0.77, with 88% of attention maps rated good or moderate. Conclusion: At 97.5% sensitivity, the MST framework correctly triaged cases without BI-RADS >=4, achieving 19% specificity for contrast-enhanced and 17% for non-contrast-enhanced MRI.

Because cognition is fixed after pre-training, improving in-context learning (ICL) for AD detection hinges on enriching perception through better demonstration (demo) sets. We demonstrate that standard ICL quickly saturates, its demos lack diversity (context width) and fail to convey fine-grained signals (context depth), and that recent task vector (TV) approaches improve broad task adaptation by injecting TV into the LLMs' hidden states (HSs), they are ill-suited for AD detection due to the mismatch of injection granularity, strength and position.

However, most existing synthetic personas remain shallow and simplistic, capturing minimal attributes and failing to reflect the rich complexity and diversity of real human identities. We introduce DEEPPERSONA, a scalable generative engine for synthesizing narrative-complete synthetic personas through a two-stage, taxonomy-guided method. First, we algorithmically construct the largest-ever human-attribute taxonomy, comprising over hundreds of hierarchically organized attributes, by mining thousands of real user-ChatGPT conversations. Second, we progressively sample attributes from this taxonomy, conditionally generating coherent and realistic personas that average hundreds of structured attributes and roughly 1 MB of narrative text, two orders of magnitude deeper than prior works. Intrinsic evaluations confirm significant improvements in attribute diversity (32 percent higher coverage) and profile uniqueness (44 percent greater) compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Extrinsically, our personas enhance GPT-4.1-mini's personalized question answering accuracy by 11.6 percent on average across ten metrics and substantially narrow (by 31.7 percent) the gap between simulated LLM citizens and authentic human responses in social surveys. Our generated national citizens reduced the performance gap on the Big Five personality test by 17 percent relative to LLM-simulated citizens.

However, current automated methods often rely on resource-heavy Large Language Models (LLMs) or static knowledge graphs and struggle with two fundamental challenges in real-world clinical data: (1) missing modalities, such as incomplete clinical context , and (2) feature entanglement, where mixed modality-specific and shared information leads to suboptimal fusion and clinically unfaithful hallucinated findings. To address these challenges, we propose the DiA-gnostic VLVAE, which achieves robust radiology reporting through Disentangled Alignment. Our framework is designed to be resilient to missing modalities by disentangling shared and modality-specific features using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) based Vision-Language Variational Autoencoder (VLVAE). A constrained optimization objective enforces orthogonality and alignment between these latent representations to prevent suboptimal fusion.

Post-layout results demonstrate near-real-time performance across several healthcare datasets, with our circuits operating within the power budget of existing flexible batteries and occupying only 2.42 mm^2, offering a promising path toward accessible, sustainable, and conformable healthcare wearables.

However, direct fine-tuning on Han-character transcriptions often fails to capture detailed phonetic and tonal cues, while training only on romanization lacks lexical and syntactic coverage. In addition, prior studies have rarely explored staged strategies that integrate both annotation types. To address this gap, we present CLiFT-ASR, a cross-lingual fine-tuning framework that builds on Mandarin HuBERT models and progressively adapts them to Taiwanese Hokkien. The framework employs a two-stage process in which it first learns acoustic and tonal representations from phonetic Tai-lo annotations and then captures vocabulary and syntax from Han-character transcriptions. This progressive adaptation enables effective alignment between speech sounds and orthographic structures. Experiments on the TAT-MOE corpus demonstrate that CLiFT-ASR achieves a 24.88\\% relative reduction in character error rate (CER) compared with strong baselines. The results indicate that CLiFT-ASR provides an effective and parameter-efficient solution for Taiwanese Hokkien ASR and that it has potential to benefit other low-resource language scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "CLiFT-ASR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982\u53f0\u6e7e\u95fd\u5357\u8bed\uff09\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5148\u5b66\u4e60\u97f3\u97f5\u7279\u5f81\u518d\u5b66\u4e60\u8bcd\u6c47\u8bed\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5b57\u7b26\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u76f8\u5bf9\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8624.88%\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u5982\u53f0\u6e7e\u95fd\u5357\u8bed\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u9762\u4e34\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u76f4\u63a5\u5fae\u8c03\u6c49\u5b57\u8f6c\u5f55\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u97f3\u97f5\u548c\u58f0\u8c03\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u800c\u4ec5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u53c8\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bcd\u6c47\u548c\u53e5\u6cd5\u8986\u76d6\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5f88\u5c11\u63a2\u7d22\u6574\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u6807\u6ce8\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u9636\u6bb5\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "CLiFT-ASR\u57fa\u4e8e\u666e\u901a\u8bddHuBERT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u9002\u5e94\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4ece\u62fc\u97f3Tai-lo\u6807\u6ce8\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u58f0\u5b66\u548c\u58f0\u8c03\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4ece\u6c49\u5b57\u8f6c\u5f55\u4e2d\u6355\u83b7\u8bcd\u6c47\u548c\u8bed\u6cd5\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u6e10\u8fdb\u9002\u5e94\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0e\u6587\u5b57\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728TAT-MOE\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCLiFT-ASR\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8624.88%\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u76f8\u5bf9\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "CLiFT-ASR\u4e3a\u53f0\u6e7e\u95fd\u5357\u8bed\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u671b\u60e0\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

To accelerate this transformation, two fundamental building blocks are essential: high-quality datasets that enable agents to achieve complex and human-relevant goals, and robust evaluation methods that allow researchers and practitioners to rapidly enhance agent performance. In this paper, we introduce DigiData, a large-scale, high-quality, diverse, multi-modal dataset designed for training mobile control agents. Unlike existing datasets, which derive goals from unstructured interactions, DigiData is meticulously constructed through comprehensive exploration of app features, resulting in greater diversity and higher goal complexity. Additionally, we present DigiData-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating mobile control agents on real-world complex tasks. We demonstrate that the commonly used step-accuracy metric falls short in reliably assessing mobile control agents and, to address this, we propose dynamic evaluation protocols and AI-powered evaluations as rigorous alternatives for agent assessment.

This paper introduces Mixture of Shared KV Attention (MoSKA), an architecture that addresses this challenge by exploiting the heterogeneity of context data. It differentiates between per-request unique and massively reused shared sequences. The core of MoSKA is a novel Shared KV Attention mechanism that transforms the attention on shared data from a series of memory-bound GEMV operations into a single, compute-bound GEMM by batching concurrent requests. This is supported by an MoE-inspired sparse attention strategy that prunes the search space and a tailored Disaggregated Infrastructure that specializes hardware for unique and shared data.

A new challenge comes when entities play roles according to their act or attributes in certain context. Entity Role Detection is the task of assigning such roles to the entities. Usu- ally real-world entities are of types: person, lo- cation and organization etc. Roles could be con- sidered as domain-dependent subtypes of these types. In the cases, where retrieving a subset of entities based on their roles is needed, poses the problem of defining the role and entities having those roles. This paper presents the study of study of solving Entity Role Detection prob- lem by modeling it as Named Entity Recogni- tion (NER) and Entity Retrieval/Ranking task. In NER, these roles could be considered as mutually exclusive classes and standard NER methods like sequence tagging could be used. For Entity Retrieval, Roles could be formulated as Query and entities as Collection on which the query needs to be executed. The aspect of Entity Retrieval task, which is different than document retrieval task is that the entities and roles against which they need to be retrieved are indirectly described. We have formulated au- tomated ways of learning representative words and phrases and building representations of roles and entities using them. We have also explored different contexts like sentence and document. Since the roles depend upon con- text, so it is not always possible to have large domain-specific dataset or knowledge bases for learning purposes, so we have tried to exploit the information from small dataset in domain- agnostic way.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5b9e\u4f53\u89d2\u8272\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5176\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b(NER)\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u68c0\u7d22/\u6392\u5e8f\u4efb\u52a1\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u5728NER\u4e2d\uff0c\u89d2\u8272\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e92\u65a5\u7c7b\u522b\uff1b\u5728\u5b9e\u4f53\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\uff0c\u89d2\u8272\u88ab\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5b9e\u4f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u68c0\u7d22\u96c6\u5408\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u5b9e\u4f53\u6839\u636e\u5176\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6216\u5c5e\u6027\u626e\u6f14\u89d2\u8272\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u68c0\u6d4b\u5b9e\u4f53\u89d2\u8272\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u5b9e\u4f53\u7c7b\u578b(\u5982\u4eba\u7269\u3001\u5730\u70b9\u3001\u7ec4\u7ec7)\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "1) \u5c06\u89d2\u8272\u68c0\u6d4b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3aNER\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5e8f\u5217\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b2) \u5c06\u89d2\u8272\u68c0\u6d4b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5b9e\u4f53\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u89d2\u8272\u4f5c\u4e3a\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5b9e\u4f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u68c0\u7d22\u96c6\u5408\uff1b3) \u81ea\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u8bcd\u8bed\u548c\u77ed\u8bed\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff1b4) \u63a2\u7d22\u53e5\u5b50\u548c\u6587\u6863\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u8868\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4ee5\u9886\u57df\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5229\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u4f53\u89d2\u8272\u68c0\u6d4b\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7NER\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u68c0\u7d22\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u5b66\u4e60\u3002"}}

Even though deep learning models have demonstrated potential, standard convolutional architectures frequently fall short in capturing enough global context, resulting in segmentations that are anatomically inconsistent. To overcome these drawbacks, we suggest a flexible, conditional Denoising Diffusion Model that combines an enhanced UNet-based generative decoder with a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder for global feature extraction. We introduce three primary innovations: 1) an Adaptive Conditioning Bridge (ACB) for efficient, multi-scale fusion of semantic features; 2) a novel Topological Denoising Consistency (TDC) loss component that regularizes training by penalizing structural inconsistencies during denoising; and 3) a dual-head architecture that leverages the denoising objective as a powerful regularizer, enabling a lightweight auxiliary head to perform rapid and accurate inference on smaller datasets and a noise prediction head. Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art on public breast ultrasound datasets, achieving Dice scores of 0.96 on BUSI, 0.90 on BrEaST and 0.97 on BUS-UCLM. Comprehensive ablation studies empirically validate that the model components are critical for achieving these results and for producing segmentations that are not only accurate but also anatomically plausible.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408ViT\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u6539\u8fdbUNet\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e73\u817a\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u75c5\u7076\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6761\u4ef6\u6865\u3001\u62d3\u6251\u53bb\u566a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u548c\u53cc\u5934\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5206\u5272\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e73\u817a\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3001\u6591\u70b9\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u6a21\u7cca\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5377\u79ef\u67b6\u6784\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u83b7\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u5272\u7ed3\u679c\u5728\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u4e0a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Vision Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6539\u8fdb\u7684UNet\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6761\u4ef6\u6865\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u62d3\u6251\u53bb\u566a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5934\u67b6\u6784\u5229\u7528\u53bb\u566a\u76ee\u6807\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b63\u5219\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u4e73\u817a\u8d85\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff1aBUSI\u6570\u636e\u96c6Dice\u5206\u65700.96\uff0cBrEaST\u6570\u636e\u96c60.90\uff0cBUS-UCLM\u6570\u636e\u96c60.97\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u8fd8\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u4e0a\u5408\u7406\u7684\u5206\u5272\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5404\u7ec4\u4ef6\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

While existing KV compression methods primarily focus on reducing prefill memory from long input sequences, they fall short in addressing the dynamic and layer-sensitive nature of long-form generation, which is central to reasoning tasks. We propose Lethe, a dynamic KV cache management framework that introduces adaptivity along both the spatial and temporal dimensions of decoding. Along the spatial dimension, Lethe performs layerwise sparsity-aware allocation, assigning token pruning budgets to each transformer layer based on estimated attention redundancy. Along the temporal dimension, Lethe conducts multi-round token pruning during generation, driven by a Recency-Aware Selective Retention} (RASR) mechanism. RASR extends traditional recency-based heuristics by also considering token relevance derived from evolving attention patterns, enabling informed decisions about which tokens to retain or evict.

However, ensuring their professional competence and ethical safety is a critical challenge, as existing benchmarks fail to measure role-playing fidelity or address the unique teaching harms inherent in educational scenarios. To address this, we propose EduGuardBench, a dual-component benchmark. It assesses professional fidelity using a Role-playing Fidelity Score (RFS) while diagnosing harms specific to the teaching profession. It also probes safety vulnerabilities using persona-based adversarial prompts targeting both general harms and, particularly, academic misconduct, evaluated with metrics including Attack Success Rate (ASR) and a three-tier Refusal Quality assessment. Our extensive experiments on 14 leading models reveal a stark polarization in performance. While reasoning-oriented models generally show superior fidelity, incompetence remains the dominant failure mode across most models. The adversarial tests uncovered a counterintuitive scaling paradox, where mid-sized models can be the most vulnerable, challenging monotonic safety assumptions. Critically, we identified a powerful Educational Transformation Effect: the safest models excel at converting harmful requests into teachable moments by providing ideal Educational Refusals.

However, compared to rigid objects, pose tracking for articulated objects remains an underexplored problem due to their inherent kinematic constraints. To address these challenges, this work proposes a novel point-pair-based pose tracking framework, termed \\textbf{PPF-Tracker}. The proposed framework first performs quasi-canonicalization of point clouds in the SE(3) Lie group space, and then models articulated objects using Point Pair Features (PPF) to predict pose voting parameters by leveraging the invariance properties of SE(3). Finally, semantic information of joint axes is incorporated to impose unified kinematic constraints across all parts of the articulated object. PPF-Tracker is systematically evaluated on both synthetic datasets and real-world scenarios, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse and challenging environments. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness and robustness of PPF-Tracker in multi-frame pose tracking of articulated objects.

However, most of these benchmarks evaluate models primarily through multiple-choice or short-answer formats, which do not take the reasoning process into account. Although some benchmarks assess the reasoning process, their methods are often overly simplistic and only examine reasoning when answers are incorrect. This approach overlooks scenarios where flawed reasoning leads to correct answers. In addition, these benchmarks do not consider the impact of intermodal relationships on reasoning. To address this issue, we propose the Reasoning Process Tree Score (RPTS), a tree structure-based metric to assess reasoning processes. Specifically, we organize the reasoning steps into a reasoning tree and leverage its hierarchical information to assign weighted faithfulness scores to each reasoning step. By dynamically adjusting these weights, RPTS not only evaluates the overall correctness of the reasoning, but also pinpoints where the model fails in the reasoning. To validate RPTS in real-world multimodal scenarios, we construct a new benchmark, RPTS-Eval, comprising 374 images and 390 reasoning instances.

However, generating compositional scenes with multiple subjects and attributes remains a significant challenge. To enhance user control over subject placement, several layout-guided methods have been proposed. However, these methods face numerous challenges, particularly in compositional scenes. Unintended subjects often appear outside the layouts, generated images can be out-of-distribution and contain unnatural artifacts, or attributes bleed across subjects, leading to incorrect visual outputs. In this work, we propose MALeR, a method that addresses each of these challenges. Given a text prompt and corresponding layouts, our method prevents subjects from appearing outside the given layouts while being in-distribution. Additionally, we propose a masked, attribute-aware binding mechanism that prevents attribute leakage, enabling accurate rendering of subjects with multiple attributes, even in complex compositional scenes. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation demonstrates that our method achieves superior performance in compositional accuracy, generation consistency, and attribute binding compared to previous work.

Previous approaches have demonstrated exceptional performance in detecting texts fully generated by LLMs. However, these methods struggle when confronting more advanced LLM output or text with adversarial multi-task machine revision, especially in the black-box setting, where the generating model is unknown. To address this challenge, grounded in the hypothesis that human writing possesses distinctive stylistic patterns, we propose Human Language Preference Detection (HLPD). HLPD employs a reward-based alignment process, Human Language Preference Optimization (HLPO), to shift the scoring model's token distribution toward human-like writing, making the model more sensitive to human writing, therefore enhancing the identification of machine-revised text. We test HLPD in an adversarial multi-task evaluation framework that leverages a five-dimensional prompt generator and multiple advanced LLMs to create diverse revision scenarios. When detecting texts revised by GPT-series models, HLPD achieves a 15.11% relative improvement in AUROC over ImBD, surpassing Fast-DetectGPT by 45.56%. When evaluated on texts generated by advanced LLMs, HLPD achieves the highest average AUROC, exceeding ImBD by 5.53% and Fast-DetectGPT by 34.14%.

Unlike humans, who interpret images through contextual and social cues, VLMs process them through statistical associations, often leading to reasoning that diverges from human reasoning. By analyzing how a VLM reasons, we can understand how inherent biases are perpetuated and can adversely affect downstream performance. To examine this gap, we systematically analyze social biases in five open-source VLMs for an occupation prediction task, on the FairFace dataset. Across 32 occupations and three different prompting styles, we elicit both predictions and reasoning. Our findings reveal that the biased reasoning patterns systematically underlie intersectional disparities, highlighting the need to align VLM reasoning with human values prior to its downstream deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5206\u6790\u4e94\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728FairFace\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u804c\u4e1a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u504f\u89c1\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4ea4\u53c9\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u524d\u5c06VLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u901a\u5e38\u7f16\u7801\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u89c1\u4f1a\u5728\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2d\u663e\u73b0\u3002\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u7ebf\u7d22\u89e3\u91ca\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0d\u540c\uff0cVLM\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u5173\u8054\u5904\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u63a8\u7406\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u5728FairFace\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e94\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90VLM\u8fdb\u884c\u804c\u4e1a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6db5\u76d632\u79cd\u804c\u4e1a\u548c\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u83b7\u53d6\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u504f\u89c1\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u4ea4\u53c9\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8868\u660eVLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728VLM\u4e0b\u6e38\u90e8\u7f72\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

This study explores distributed deep learning for denoising chest X-ray images from the NIH Chest X-ray14 dataset, using additive Gaussian noise as a lightweight obfuscation technique. We implement and evaluate U-Net and U-Net++ architectures under single-GPU, standard multi-GPU (DataParallel), and optimized multi-GPU training configurations using PyTorch's DistributedDataParallel (DDP) and Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP). Our results show that U-Net++ consistently delivers superior denoising performance, achieving competitive Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structured Similarity Index Method (SSIM) scores, though with less performance in Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) compared to U-Net under low and moderate noise levels. This indicates U-Net++'s enhanced structural fidelity and low perceptual similarity. Meanwhile, our optimized training pipeline reduces training time by over 60% for both models compared to single-GPU training, and outperforms standard DataParallel by over 40%, with only a minor accuracy drop for both models (trading some accuracy for speed). These findings highlight the effectiveness of software-level optimization in distributed learning for medical imaging. This work demonstrates the practical viability of combining architectural design, lightweight obfuscation, and advanced distributed training strategies to accelerate and enhance medical image processing pipelines in real-world clinical and research environments.

It helps extract features from embedded vectors by adding global information and its expressivity has been proved to be powerful. Nevertheless, the quadratic complexity restricts its practicability. Although several researches have provided attention mechanism in sparse form, they are lack of theoretical analysis about the expressivity of their mechanism while reducing complexity. In this paper, we put forward Random Batch Attention (RBA), a linear self-attention mechanism, which has theoretical support of the ability to maintain its expressivity. Random Batch Attention has several significant strengths as follows: (1) Random Batch Attention has linear time complexity. Other than this, it can be implemented in parallel on a new dimension, which contributes to much memory saving. (2) Random Batch Attention mechanism can improve most of the existing models by replacing their attention mechanisms, even many previously improved attention mechanisms.

Code and interactive demo available", "summary": "Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand neural networks by identifying which learned features mediate specific behaviors. Attribution graphs reveal these feature pathways, but interpreting them requires extensive manual analysis -- a single prompt can take approximately 2 hours for an experienced circuit tracer. We present probe prompting, an automated pipeline that transforms attribution graphs into compact, interpretable subgraphs built from concept-aligned supernodes. Starting from a seed prompt and target logit, we select high-influence features, generate concept-targeted yet context-varying probes, and group features by cross-prompt activation signatures into Semantic, Relationship, and Say-X categories using transparent decision rules.\n  Across five prompts including classic \"capitals\" circuits, probe-prompted subgraphs preserve high explanatory coverage while compressing complexity (Completeness 0.83, mean across circuits; Replacement 0.54). Compared to geometric clustering baselines, concept-aligned groups exhibit higher behavioral coherence: 2.3x higher peak-token consistency (0.425 vs 0.183) and 5.8x higher activation-pattern similarity (0.762 vs 0.130), despite lower geometric compactness. Entity-swap tests reveal a layerwise hierarchy: early-layer features transfer robustly (64% transfer rate, mean layer 6.3), while late-layer Say-X features specialize for output promotion (mean layer 16.4), supporting a backbone-and-specialization view of transformer computation.\n  We release code (https://github.com/peppinob-ol/attribution-graph-probing), an interactive demo (https://huggingface.co/spaces/Peppinob/attribution-graph-probing), and minimal artifacts enabling immediate reproduction and community adoption.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aprobe prompting\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u5c06\u5f52\u56e0\u56fe\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5b50\u56fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8d85\u7ea7\u8282\u70b9\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u624b\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u54ea\u4e9b\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u4ecb\u5bfc\u7279\u5b9a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5f52\u56e0\u56fe\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u624b\u52a8\u5206\u6790\uff08\u5355\u4e2a\u63d0\u793a\u7ea6\u97002\u5c0f\u65f6\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u79cd\u5b50\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u76ee\u6807logit\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6982\u5ff5\u76ee\u6807\u4f46\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u900f\u660e\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5219\u5c06\u7279\u5f81\u6309\u8de8\u63d0\u793a\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7b7e\u540d\u5206\u7ec4\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u5173\u7cfb\u548cSay-X\u7c7b\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u63d0\u793a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cprobe-prompted\u5b50\u56fe\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u89e3\u91ca\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u540c\u65f6\u538b\u7f29\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff08\u5b8c\u6574\u60270.83\uff0c\u66ff\u63620.54\uff09\u3002\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u805a\u7c7b\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u9f50\u7ec4\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1a\u5cf0\u503c\u6807\u8bb0\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u63d0\u9ad82.3\u500d\uff0c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u5f0f\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u63d0\u9ad85.8\u500d\u3002\u5b9e\u4f53\u4ea4\u6362\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301transformer\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u9aa8\u5e72-\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u7a33\u5065\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u665a\u671f\u5c42Say-X\u7279\u5f81\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u8f93\u51fa\u4fc3\u8fdb\u3002\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u6f14\u793a\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5de5\u4ef6\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u793e\u533a\u91c7\u7528\u3002"}}

Conventional compression methods for obtaining compact models require computations for each individual student model. When multiple models of varying sizes are needed to accommodate different resource conditions, this leads to repetitive and cumbersome computations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel knowledge inheritance approach named OSKT (One-Shot Knowledge Transfer), which consolidates the knowledge of the teacher model into an intermediate carrier called a weight chain. When a downstream scenario demands a model that meets specific resource constraints, this weight chain can be expanded to the target model size without additional computation.

To address these challenges, we introduce \\textbf{LMT}, a suite of \\textbf{L}arge-scale \\textbf{M}ultilingual \\textbf{T}ranslation models centered on both Chinese and English, covering 60 languages and 234 translation directions. During development, we identify a previously overlooked phenomenon of \\textbf{directional degeneration}, where symmetric multi-way fine-tuning data overemphasize reverse directions (X $\\to$ En/Zh), leading to excessive many-to-one mappings and degraded translation quality. We propose \\textbf{Strategic Downsampling}, a simple yet effective method to mitigate this degeneration.

While classical methods rely on optical flow and learning-based models assume access to dense ground-truth, both struggle with occlusions, domain shifts, and ambiguous motion. This article introduces MiVID, a lightweight, self-supervised, diffusion-based framework for video interpolation. Our model eliminates the need for explicit motion estimation by combining a 3D U-Net backbone with transformer-style temporal attention, trained under a hybrid masking regime that simulates occlusions and motion uncertainty. The use of cosine-based progressive masking and adaptive loss scheduling allows our network to learn robust spatiotemporal representations without any high-frame-rate supervision. Our framework is evaluated on UCF101-7 and DAVIS-7 datasets. MiVID is trained entirely on CPU using the datasets and 9-frame video segments, making it a low-resource yet highly effective pipeline.

In this work, we propose a novel backdoor attack on tabular data, which is particularly challenging due to the presence of both numerical and categorical features. Our key idea is a novel technique to convert categorical values into floating-point representations. This approach preserves enough information to maintain clean-model accuracy compared to traditional methods like one-hot or ordinal encoding. By doing this, we create a gradient-based universal perturbation that applies to all features, including categorical ones.\n  We evaluate our method on five datasets and four popular models. Our results show up to a 100% attack success rate in both white-box and black-box settings (including real-world applications like Vertex AI), revealing a severe vulnerability for tabular data. Our method is shown to surpass the previous works like Tabdoor in terms of performance, while remaining stealthy against state-of-the-art defense mechanisms.

This backbone-plus-aggregator paradigm has achieved overwhelming dominance in the CNN era and remains widely used in transformer-based models. In this paper, however, we argue that a dedicated aggregator is not necessary in the transformer era, that is, we can obtain robust global descriptors only with the backbone. Specifically, we introduce some learnable aggregation tokens, which are prepended to the patch tokens before a particular transformer block. All these tokens will be jointly processed and interact globally via the intrinsic self-attention mechanism, implicitly aggregating useful information within the patch tokens to the aggregation tokens. Finally, we only take these aggregation tokens from the last output tokens and concatenate them as the global representation. Although implicit aggregation can provide robust global descriptors in an extremely simple manner, where and how to insert additional tokens, as well as the initialization of tokens, remains an open issue worthy of further exploration. To this end, we also propose the optimal token insertion strategy and token initialization method derived from empirical studies. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several VPR datasets with higher efficiency and ranks 1st on the MSLS challenge leaderboard.

We present an end-to-end system that scales long-sequence modeling to 10k-length histories in production. First, we introduce Stacked Target-to-History Cross Attention (STCA), which replaces history self-attention with stacked cross-attention from the target to the history, reducing complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length and enabling efficient end-to-end training. Second, we propose Request Level Batching (RLB), a user-centric batching scheme that aggregates multiple targets for the same user/request to share the user-side encoding, substantially lowering sequence-related storage, communication, and compute without changing the learning objective. Third, we design a length-extrapolative training strategy -- train on shorter windows, infer on much longer ones -- so the model generalizes to 10k histories without additional training cost. Across offline and online experiments, we observe predictable, monotonic gains as we scale history length and model capacity, mirroring the scaling law behavior observed in large language models. Deployed at full traffic on Douyin, our system delivers significant improvements on key engagement metrics while meeting production latency, demonstrating a practical path to scaling end-to-end long-sequence recommendation to the 10k regime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c06\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\u523010k\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u7528\u6237\u5386\u53f2\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7STCA\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3001\u8bf7\u6c42\u7ea7\u6279\u5904\u7406\u548c\u957f\u5ea6\u5916\u63a8\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u6296\u97f3\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u5229\u7528\u6781\u957f\u7684\u7528\u6237\u5386\u53f2\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u80fd\u7a81\u7834\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6216\u6210\u672c\u9884\u7b97\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u4ea7\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u740610k\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "method": "1) STCA\uff1a\u7528\u5806\u53e0\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5230\u5386\u53f2\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u66ff\u6362\u5386\u53f2\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4ece\u4e8c\u6b21\u964d\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\uff1b2) RLB\uff1a\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6279\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u805a\u5408\u540c\u4e00\u7528\u6237\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u5171\u4eab\u7f16\u7801\uff1b3) \u957f\u5ea6\u5916\u63a8\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1a\u5728\u8f83\u77ed\u7a97\u53e3\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u66f4\u957f\u7a97\u53e3\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ebf\u4e0b\u548c\u7ebf\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u5386\u53f2\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u7b26\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u5b9a\u5f8b\u3002\u5728\u6296\u97f3\u5168\u6d41\u91cf\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u751f\u4ea7\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u5c06\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u6269\u5c55\u523010k\u7ea7\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u5b9e\u7528\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

However, research to date has largely been in non-clinical cross-sectional samples of written language using complex machine learning (ML) approaches with limited interpretability.\n  Methods: We describe an initial exploratory analysis of longitudinal speech data and PHQ-8 assessments from 5,836 recordings of 586 participants in the UK, Netherlands, and Spain, collected in the RADAR-MDD study. We sought to identify interpretable lexical features associated with MDD symptom severity with linear mixed-effects modelling. Interpretable features and high-dimensional vector embeddings were also used to test the prediction performance of four regressor ML models.\n  Results: In English data, MDD symptom severity was associated with 7 features including lexical diversity measures and absolutist language. In Dutch, associations were observed with words per sentence and positive word frequency; no associations were observed in recordings collected in Spain. The predictive power of lexical features and vector embeddings was near chance level across all languages.\n  Limitations: Smaller samples in non-English speech and methodological choices, such as the elicitation prompt, may have also limited the effect sizes observable. A lack of NLP tools in languages other than English restricted our feature choice.\n  Conclusion: To understand the value of lexical markers in clinical research and practice, further research is needed in larger samples across several languages using improved protocols, and ML models that account for within- and between-individual variations in language.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6765\u81ea586\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u76845836\u4e2a\u5f55\u97f3\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u91cd\u5ea6\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u75c7\u72b6\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u82f1\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u67097\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8377\u5170\u8bed\u4e2d\u4e0e\u53e5\u5b50\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u79ef\u6781\u8bcd\u6c47\u9891\u7387\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u8bed\u4e2d\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5173\u8054\u3002\u8bcd\u6c47\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5411\u91cf\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u63a5\u8fd1\u968f\u673a\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u5229\u7528\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u91c7\u96c6\u7684\u53e3\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u5ba2\u89c2\u3001\u5b9a\u671f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u75c7\u72b6\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5e76\u65e9\u671f\u53d1\u73b0\u590d\u53d1\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u975e\u4e34\u5e8a\u6a2a\u65ad\u9762\u4e66\u9762\u8bed\u8a00\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u590d\u6742\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9RADAR-MDD\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d586\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u76845836\u4e2a\u5f55\u97f3\u8fdb\u884c\u7eb5\u5411\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u6df7\u5408\u6548\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0eMDD\u75c7\u72b6\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u8bcd\u6c47\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56db\u79cd\u56de\u5f52\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u82f1\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u4e2dMDD\u75c7\u72b6\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0e7\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8bcd\u6c47\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u7edd\u5bf9\u4e3b\u4e49\u8bed\u8a00\uff1b\u8377\u5170\u8bed\u4e2d\u4e0e\u6bcf\u53e5\u8bcd\u6570\u548c\u79ef\u6781\u8bcd\u6c47\u9891\u7387\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u8bed\u4e2d\u672a\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u5173\u8054\u3002\u8bcd\u6c47\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5411\u91cf\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u90fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u968f\u673a\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u7406\u89e3\u8bcd\u6c47\u6807\u8bb0\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u66f4\u5927\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u8003\u8651\u4e2a\u4f53\u5185\u5916\u8bed\u8a00\u53d8\u5f02\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Existing methods address this problem through depth completion in the image domain, but they overlook the physical characteristics of raw depth images. It has been observed that the presence of invalid depth areas alters the frequency distribution pattern. In this work, we propose a Spatio-Spectral Mutual Learning framework (S2ML) to harmonize the advantages of both spatial and frequency domains for depth completion. Specifically, we consider the distinct properties of amplitude and phase spectra and devise a dedicated spectral fusion module. Meanwhile, the local and global correlations between spatial-domain and frequency-domain features are calculated in a unified embedding space. The gradual mutual representation and refinement encourage the network to fully explore complementary physical characteristics and priors for more accurate depth completion.

Traditional surrogate modeling approaches often incur high energy consumption, which severely limits their scalability and deployability in resource-constrained environments. We introduce NeuroPOL, \\textit{the first neuroscience-inspired physics-informed operator learning framework} for reliability analysis. NeuroPOL incorporates Variable Spiking Neurons into a physics-informed operator architecture, replacing continuous activations with event-driven spiking dynamics. This innovation promotes sparse communication, significantly reduces computational load, and enables an energy-efficient surrogate model. The proposed framework lowers both computational and power demands, supporting real-time reliability assessment and deployment on edge devices and digital twins. By embedding governing physical laws into operator learning, NeuroPOL builds physics-consistent surrogates capable of accurate uncertainty propagation and efficient failure probability estimation, even for high-dimensional problems. We evaluate NeuroPOL on five canonical benchmarks, the Burgers equation, Nagumo equation, two-dimensional Poisson equation, two-dimensional Darcy equation, and incompressible Navier-Stokes equation with energy coupling.

Code will be released at https://www.github.com/kkkzh/StreamSTGS", "summary": "Streaming free-viewpoint video~(FVV) in real-time still faces significant challenges, particularly in training, rendering, and transmission efficiency. Harnessing superior performance of 3D Gaussian Splatting~(3DGS), recent 3DGS-based FVV methods have achieved notable breakthroughs in both training and rendering. However, the storage requirements of these methods can reach up to $10$MB per frame, making stream FVV in real-time impossible. To address this problem, we propose a novel FVV representation, dubbed StreamSTGS, designed for real-time streaming. StreamSTGS represents a dynamic scene using canonical 3D Gaussians, temporal features, and a deformation field. For high compression efficiency, we encode canonical Gaussian attributes as 2D images and temporal features as a video. This design not only enables real-time streaming, but also inherently supports adaptive bitrate control based on network condition without any extra training. Moreover, we propose a sliding window scheme to aggregate adjacent temporal features to learn local motions, and then introduce a transformer-guided auxiliary training module to learn global motions. On diverse FVV benchmarks, StreamSTGS demonstrates competitive performance on all metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods.

This study evaluates multiple approaches for mental health detection, comparing Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Llama and GPT with classical machine learning and transformer-based architectures including BERT, XLNet, and Distil-RoBERTa. Using the DAIC-WOZ dataset of clinical interviews, we fine-tuned models for anxiety, depression, and stress classification and applied synthetic data generation to mitigate class imbalance. Results show that Distil-RoBERTa achieved the highest F1 score (0.883) for GAD-2, while XLNet outperformed others on PHQ tasks (F1 up to 0.891). For stress detection, a zero-shot synthetic approach (SD+Zero-Shot-Basic) reached an F1 of 0.884 and ROC AUC of 0.886. Findings demonstrate the effectiveness of transformer-based models and highlight the value of synthetic data in improving recall and generalization.

Differing from existing transformer-based offline text-to-video generation models, Neodragon is the first to have been specifically optimised for mobile hardware to achieve efficient and high-fidelity video synthesis. We achieve this through four key technical contributions: (1) Replacing the original large 4.762B T5xxl Text-Encoder with a much smaller 0.2B DT5 (DistilT5) with minimal quality loss, enabled through a novel Text-Encoder Distillation procedure. (2) Proposing an Asymmetric Decoder Distillation approach allowing us to replace the native codec-latent-VAE decoder with a more efficient one, without disturbing the generative latent-space of the generation pipeline. (3) Pruning of MMDiT blocks within the denoiser backbone based on their relative importance, with recovery of original performance through a two-stage distillation process. (4) Reducing the NFE (Neural Functional Evaluation) requirement of the denoiser by performing step distillation using DMD adapted for pyramidal flow-matching, thereby substantially accelerating video generation.

Recent works have explored synthetic data generation to address this challenge, however, they suffer from data quality issues where synthesized tasks contain hallucinations that cannot be executed, and collected trajectories are noisy with redundant or misaligned actions. In this paper, we propose SynthAgent, a fully synthetic supervision framework that aims at improving synthetic data quality via dual refinement of both tasks and trajectories. Our approach begins by synthesizing diverse tasks through categorized exploration of web elements, ensuring efficient coverage of the target environment. During trajectory collection, we refine tasks when conflicts with actual observations are detected, mitigating hallucinations while maintaining task consistency. After collection, we conduct trajectory refinement with a global context to mitigate potential noise or misalignments. Finally, we fine-tune open-source web agents on the refined synthetic data to adapt them to the target environment. Experimental results demonstrate that SynthAgent outperforms existing synthetic data methods, validating the importance of high-quality synthetic supervision.

While supervised learning has achieved significant progress in this area, it relies heavily on large-scale labeled datasets, which are difficult to obtain in practical scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a pseudo label-based unsupervised method called LoopExpose for arbitrary-length exposure correction. A nested loop optimization strategy is proposed to address the exposure correction problem, where the correction model and pseudo-supervised information are jointly optimized in a two-level framework. Specifically, the upper-level trains a correction model using pseudo-labels generated through multi-exposure fusion at the lower level. A feedback mechanism is introduced where corrected images are fed back into the fusion process to refine the pseudo-labels, creating a self-reinforcing learning loop. Considering the dominant role of luminance calibration in exposure correction, a Luminance Ranking Loss is introduced to leverage the relative luminance ordering across the input sequence as a self-supervised constraint. Extensive experiments on different benchmark datasets demonstrate that LoopExpose achieves superior exposure correction and fusion performance, outperforming existing state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.

We developed an end-to-end machine learning framework with two key contributions (1) Clinically-aware OOD-regularized Model-based Policy Optimization (CORMPO), a density-regularized offline RL algorithm for out-of-distribution suppression that also incorporates clinically-informed reward shaping and (2) a Transformer-based probabilistic digital twin that models MCS circulatory dynamics for policy evaluation with rich physiological and clinical metrics. We prove that \\textsf{CORMPO} achieves theoretical performance guarantees under mild assumptions. CORMPO attains a higher reward than the offline RL baselines by 28% and higher scores in clinical metrics by 82.6% on real and synthetic datasets. Our approach offers a principled framework for safe offline policy learning in high-stakes medical applications where domain expertise and safety constraints are essential.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u68b0\u5faa\u73af\u652f\u6301\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u64a4\u673a\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5305\u542bCORMPO\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u548cTransformer\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u673a\u68b0\u5faa\u73af\u652f\u6301\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u64a4\u673a\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u533b\u7597\u56e2\u961f\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u533b\u7597\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u3001\u7981\u6b62\u5728\u7ebf\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u5faa\u73af\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCORMPO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u4e34\u5e8a\u611f\u77e5\u7684OOD\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6291\u5236\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u878d\u5165\u4e34\u5e8a\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fdb\u884c\u5956\u52b1\u5851\u9020\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u5faa\u73af\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "result": "CORMPO\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6bd4\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u83b7\u5f9728%\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f9782.6%\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6e29\u548c\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u533b\u7597\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u79bb\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u5219\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, we introduce Supervised Rational Attention (SRA), a framework that explicitly aligns model attention with human rationales, improving both interpretability and fairness in hate speech classification. SRA integrates a supervised attention mechanism into transformer-based classifiers, optimizing a joint objective that combines standard classification loss with an alignment loss term that minimizes the discrepancy between attention weights and human-annotated rationales. We evaluated SRA on hate speech benchmarks in English (HateXplain) and Portuguese (HateBRXplain) with rationale annotations. Empirically, SRA achieves 2.4x better explainability compared to current baselines, and produces token-level explanations that are more faithful and human-aligned. In terms of fairness, SRA achieves competitive fairness across all measures, with second-best performance in detecting toxic posts targeting identity groups, while maintaining comparable results on other metrics. These findings demonstrate that incorporating human rationales into attention mechanisms can enhance interpretability and faithfulness without compromising fairness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u76d1\u7763\u7406\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b(SRA)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7406\u6027\u6807\u6ce8\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u6027\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u76d1\u7763\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u7c7b\u635f\u5931\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b-\u7406\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u635f\u5931\u7684\u8054\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u82f1\u8bed\u548c\u8461\u8404\u7259\u8bed\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cSRA\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf2.4\u500d\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5fe0\u5b9e\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684token\u7ea7\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u7406\u6027\u6807\u6ce8\u878d\u5165\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u3002"}}

However, those random sampling of sub-models may not give satisfying convergence performance. In this paper, observing the success of SGD with shuffling, we propose a distributed shuffled sub-model training, where the full model is partitioned into several sub-models in advance, and the server shuffles those sub-models, sends each of them to clients at each round, and by the end of local updating period, clients send back the updated sub-models, and server averages them.

Its success depends not only on the quality of the instruction data but also on the inherent capabilities of the LLM itself. Some studies suggest that even a small amount of high-quality data can achieve instruction fine-tuning results that are on par with, or even exceed, those from using a full-scale dataset. However, rather than focusing solely on calculating data quality scores to evaluate instruction data, there is a growing need to select high-quality data that maximally enhances the performance of instruction tuning for a given LLM. In this paper, we propose the Model Instruction Weakness Value (MIWV) as a novel metric to quantify the importance of instruction data in enhancing model's capabilities.

Conventional deblurring approaches are often inadequate in handling spatially varying blur and typically fall short in modeling the long-range dependencies necessary for restoring textual clarity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a hybrid deep learning framework that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with vision transformers (ViTs), thereby leveraging both local feature extraction and global contextual reasoning. The architecture employs a CNN-based encoder-decoder to preserve structural details, while a transformer module enhances global awareness through self-attention. Training is conducted on a curated dataset derived from TextOCR, where sharp scene-text samples are paired with synthetically blurred versions generated using realistic motion-blur kernels of multiple sizes and orientations. Model optimization is guided by a composite loss that incorporates mean absolute error (MAE), squared error (MSE), perceptual similarity, and structural similarity (SSIM). Quantitative evaluations show that the proposed method attains 32.20 dB in PSNR and 0.934 in SSIM, while remaining lightweight with 2.83 million parameters and an average inference time of 61 ms.

Traditionally, relational data has been a source of various insights, but with the increase in computational power and the need to understand deeper relationships between entities, the need to design new techniques has arisen. For this graph data analysis has become an extraordinary tool for understanding the data, which reveals more realistic and flexible modelling of complex relationships. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in various applications, such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, drug discovery, and more. However, many adversarial attacks can happen over the data, whether during training (poisoning attack) or during testing (evasion attack), which can adversely manipulate the desired outcome from the GNN model. Therefore, it is crucial to make the GNNs robust to such attacks. The existing robustness methods are computationally demanding and perform poorly when the intensity of attack increases. This paper presents a computationally efficient framework, namely, pLAPGNN, based on weighted p-Laplacian for making GNNs robust.

However, current flow-based inverse solvers face two primary limitations: (i) they operate directly in pixel space, which demands heavy computational resources for training and restricts scalability to high-resolution images, and (ii) they employ guidance strategies with prior-agnostic posterior covariances, which can weaken alignment with the generative trajectory and degrade posterior coverage. In this paper, we propose LFlow (Latent Refinement via Flows), a training-free framework for solving linear inverse problems via pretrained latent flow priors. LFlow leverages the efficiency of flow matching to perform ODE sampling in latent space along an optimal path. This latent formulation further allows us to introduce a theoretically grounded posterior covariance, derived from the optimal vector field, enabling effective flow guidance.

Samad"], "title": "LLM Attention Transplant for Transfer Learning of Tabular Data Across Disparate Domains", "comment": null, "summary": "Transfer learning of tabular data is non-trivial due to heterogeneity in the feature space across disparate domains. The limited success of traditional deep learning in tabular knowledge transfer can be advanced by leveraging large language models (LLMs). However, the efficacy of LLMs often stagnates for mixed data types structured in tables due to the limitations of text prompts and in-context learning. We propose a lightweight transfer learning framework that fine-tunes an LLM using source tabular data and transplants the LLM's selective $key$ and $value$ projection weights into a gated feature tokenized transformer (gFTT) built for tabular data. The gFTT model with cross-domain attention is fine-tuned using target tabular data for transfer learning, eliminating the need for shared features, LLM prompt engineering, and large-scale pretrained models.

However, processing high-resolution imagery in real time presents significant challenges due to the computational demands of feature extraction, matching, and bundle adjustment (BA). Conventional BA methods either downsample images, sacrificing important details, or require extensive processing time, making them unsuitable for time-critical missions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel real-time BA framework that operates directly on fullresolution UAV imagery without downsampling. Our lightweight, onboard-compatible approach divides each image into user-defined patches (e.g., NxN grids, default 150x150 pixels) and dynamically tracks them across frames using UAV GNSS/IMU data and a coarse, globally available digital surface model (DSM). This ensures spatial consistency for robust feature extraction and matching between patches. Overlapping relationships between images are determined in real time using UAV navigation system, enabling the rapid selection of relevant neighbouring images for localized BA. By limiting optimization to a sliding cluster of overlapping images, including those from adjacent flight strips, the method achieves real-time performance while preserving the accuracy of global BA. The proposed algorithm is designed for seamless integration into the DLR Modular Aerial Camera System (MACS), supporting largearea mapping in real time for disaster response, infrastructure monitoring, and coastal protection. Validation on MACS datasets with 50MP images demonstrates that the method maintains precise camera orientations and high-fidelity mapping across multiple strips, running full bundle adjustment in under 2 seconds without GPU acceleration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u964d\u91c7\u6837\u5373\u53ef\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65f6\u5149\u675f\u6cd5\u5e73\u5dee\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u707e\u5bb3\u54cd\u5e94\u7b49\u7d27\u6025\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u4e8e\u707e\u5bb3\u54cd\u5e94\u7b49\u9700\u8981\u5feb\u901f\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u5149\u675f\u6cd5\u5e73\u5dee\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u964d\u91c7\u6837\u635f\u5931\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u8fc7\u957f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6bcf\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u533a\u5757\uff08\u5982150x150\u50cf\u7d20\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u4eba\u673aGNSS/IMU\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5168\u7403\u6570\u5b57\u8868\u9762\u6a21\u578b\u52a8\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u533a\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u65b9\u5f0f\u4ec5\u5bf9\u91cd\u53e0\u56fe\u50cf\u7c07\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u5149\u675f\u6cd5\u5e73\u5dee\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u572850MP\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u57282\u79d2\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5149\u675f\u6cd5\u5e73\u5dee\uff0c\u65e0\u9700GPU\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u5b9a\u5411\u548c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u707e\u5bb3\u54cd\u5e94\u3001\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u6d77\u5cb8\u4fdd\u62a4\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u5927\u9762\u79ef\u6d4b\u7ed8\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Prior work has established that $O(d \\log n)$ samples are sufficient for this task. However, an important factor that is often overlooked in these analyses is the dependence on the condition number of the covariance matrix of the model. Indeed, all algorithms from prior work require a number of samples that grows polynomially with this condition number. In many cases this is unsatisfactory, since the condition number could grow polynomially with $n$, rendering these prior approaches impractical in high-dimensional settings. In this work, we provide an algorithm that recovers the underlying graph and prove that the number of samples required is independent of the condition number. Furthermore, we establish lower bounds that nearly match the upper bound up to a $d$-factor, thus providing an almost tight characterization of the true sample complexity of the problem. Moreover, under a further assumption that all the variances of the variables are bounded, we design a polynomial-time algorithm that recovers the underlying graph, at the cost of an additional polynomial dependence of the sample complexity on $d$.

However, explicit CoT methods rely on discrete token-level reasoning processes that are prone to error propagation and limited by vocabulary expressiveness, often resulting in rigid and inconsistent reasoning trajectories. Recent research has explored implicit or continuous reasoning in latent spaces, allowing models to perform internal reasoning before generating explicit output. Although such approaches alleviate some limitations of discrete CoT, they generally lack explicit mechanisms to enforce consistency among reasoning steps, leading to divergent reasoning paths and unstable outcomes. To address this issue, we propose EBM-CoT, an Energy-Based Chain-of-Thought Calibration framework that refines latent thought representations through an energy-based model (EBM). Our method dynamically adjusts latent reasoning trajectories toward lower-energy, high-consistency regions in the embedding space, improving both reasoning accuracy and consistency without modifying the base language model. Extensive experiments across mathematical, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances the consistency and efficiency of multi-step reasoning in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86EBM-CoT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6821\u51c6\u9690\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8LLMs\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CoT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u8fbe\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9690\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u53d1\u6563\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5411\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u3001\u9ad8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u533a\u57df\u79fb\u52a8", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u5e38\u8bc6\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86LLMs\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387", "conclusion": "EBM-CoT\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u57fa\u7840\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027"}}

However, early filming equipment limitations have degraded videos of last-century performances by renowned artists (e.g., low frame rates and resolution), hindering archival efforts. Although space-time video super-resolution (STVSR) has advanced significantly, applying it directly to opera videos remains challenging. The scarcity of datasets impedes the recovery of high frequency details, and existing STVSR methods lack global modeling capabilities, compromising visual quality when handling opera's characteristic large motions. To address these challenges, we pioneer a large scale Chinese Opera Video Clip (COVC) dataset and propose the Mamba-based multiscale fusion network for space-time Opera Video Super-Resolution (MambaOVSR). Specifically, MambaOVSR involves three novel components: the Global Fusion Module (GFM) for motion modeling through a multiscale alternating scanning mechanism, and the Multiscale Synergistic Mamba Module (MSMM) for alignment across different sequence lengths. Additionally, our MambaVR block resolves feature artifacts and positional information loss during alignment. Experimental results on the COVC dataset show that MambaOVSR significantly outperforms the SOTA STVSR method by an average of 1.86 dB in terms of PSNR.

Existing methods proposed to handle noisy clients assume that a sufficient number of clients with clean labels are available, which can be leveraged to learn a robust global model while dampening the impact of noisy clients. This assumption fails when a high number of heterogeneous clients contain noisy labels, making the existing approaches ineffective. In such scenarios, it is important to locally regularize the clients before communication with the global model, to ensure the global model isn't corrupted by noisy clients. While pre-trained self-supervised models can be effective for local regularization, existing centralized approaches relying on pretrained initialization are impractical in a federated setting due to the potentially large size of these models, which increases communication costs. In that line, we propose a regularization objective for client models that decouples the pre-trained and classification models by enforcing similarity between close data points within the client. We leverage the representation space of a self-supervised pretrained model to evaluate the closeness among examples. This regularization, when applied with the standard objective function for the downstream task in standard noisy federated settings, significantly improves performance, outperforming existing state-of-the-art federated methods in multiple computer vision and medical image classification benchmarks.

To achieve this, we fine-tune a large language model (LLM) to translate free-form texts into JSON representations containing NURBS surface parameters (\\textit{i.e}, control points, knot vectors, degrees, and rational weights) which can be directly converted into BRep format using Python. We further propose a hybrid representation that combines untrimmed NURBS with analytic primitives to handle trimmed surfaces and degenerate regions more robustly, while reducing token complexity. Additionally, we introduce partABC, a curated subset of the ABC dataset consisting of individual CAD components, annotated with detailed captions using an automated annotation pipeline.

Accurate and timely inference of supply chain resilience the capability to maintain core functions during disruptions is crucial for proactive risk mitigation and robust network design. However, existing approaches lack effective mechanisms to infer supply chain resilience without explicit system dynamics and struggle to represent the higher-order, multi-entity dependencies inherent in supply chain networks. These limitations motivate the definition of a novel problem and the development of targeted modeling solutions. To address these challenges, we formalize a novel problem: Supply Chain Resilience Inference (SCRI), defined as predicting supply chain resilience using hypergraph topology and observed inventory trajectories without explicit dynamic equations. To solve this problem, we propose the Supply Chain Resilience Inference Hypergraph Network (SC-RIHN), a novel hypergraph-based model leveraging set-based encoding and hypergraph message passing to capture multi-party firm-product interactions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SC-RIHN significantly outperforms traditional MLP, representative graph neural network variants, and ResInf baselines across synthetic benchmarks, underscoring its potential for practical, early-warning risk assessment in complex supply chain systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u97e7\u6027\u63a8\u65ad\u95ee\u9898(SCRI)\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86SC-RIHN\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u5e93\u5b58\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u97e7\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u52a8\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u673a\u5236\u6765\u63a8\u65ad\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u97e7\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u8868\u793a\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u591a\u5b9e\u4f53\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8fd9\u4fc3\u4f7f\u5b9a\u4e49\u65b0\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSC-RIHN\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u56fe\u7684\u96c6\u5408\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u8d85\u56fe\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u591a\u65b9\u4f01\u4e1a-\u4ea7\u54c1\u4ea4\u4e92\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eSC-RIHN\u5728\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfMLP\u3001\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u53d8\u4f53\u548cResInf\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "SC-RIHN\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Here, we are given as input a design matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d}$ and measurements or labels ${y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^N$ where ${y} = {X} {w}^* + \u03be$, and $\u03be$ is the noise in the measurements. Importantly, we have the additional constraint that the unknown signal vector ${w}^*$ is sparse: it has $k$ non-zero entries where $k$ is much smaller than the ambient dimension. Our goal is to output a prediction vector $\\widehat{w}$ that has small prediction error: $\\frac{1}{N}\\cdot \\|{X} {w}^* - {X} \\widehat{w}\\|^2_2$.\n  Information-theoretically, we know what is best possible in terms of measurements: under most natural noise distributions, we can get prediction error at most $\u03b5$ with roughly $N = O(k \\log d/\u03b5)$ samples. Computationally, this currently needs $d^{\u03a9(k)}$ run-time. Alternately, with $N = O(d)$, we can get polynomial-time. Thus, there is an exponential gap (in the dependence on $d$) between the two and we do not know if it is possible to get $d^{o(k)}$ run-time and $o(d)$ samples.\n  We give the first generic positive result for worst-case design matrices ${X}$: For any ${X}$, we show that if the support of ${w}^*$ is chosen at random, we can get prediction error $\u03b5$ with $N = \\text{poly}(k, \\log d, 1/\u03b5)$ samples and run-time $\\text{poly}(d,N)$. This run-time holds for any design matrix ${X}$ with condition number up to $2^{\\text{poly}(d)}$.\n  Previously, such results were known for worst-case ${w}^*$, but only for random design matrices from well-behaved families, matrices that have a very low condition number ($\\text{poly}(\\log d)$; e.g., as studied in compressed sensing), or those with special structural properties.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u4efb\u610f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u77e9\u9635X\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6b63\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5728w*\u7684\u652f\u6301\u96c6\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u03b5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a00\u758f\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u9700\u8981O(k log d/\u03b5)\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u9700\u8981d^\u03a9(k)\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u800c\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u9700\u8981O(d)\u6837\u672c\u3002\u8fd9\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e9a\u7ebf\u6027\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u77e9\u9635X\uff0c\u5f53w*\u7684\u652f\u6301\u96c6\u662f\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\u65f6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528poly(k, log d, 1/\u03b5)\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u548cpoly(d,N)\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u03b5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u6570\u9ad8\u8fbe2^poly(d)\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u77e9\u9635\u3002", "result": "\u9996\u6b21\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u77e9\u9635X\uff0c\u5728w*\u652f\u6301\u96c6\u968f\u673a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a00\u758f\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4e4b\u524d\u53ea\u80fd\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u578b\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u4efb\u610f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u77e9\u9635\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

While the overall intensity and categorical values of emotions in arguments have received considerable attention in the research community, we argue that the emotion an argument evokes in a recipient is subjective. It depends on the recipient's goals, standards, prior knowledge, and stance. Appraisal theories lend themselves as a link between the subjective cognitive assessment of events and emotions. They have been used in event-centric emotion analysis, but their suitability for assessing argument convincingness remains unexplored. In this paper, we evaluate whether appraisal theories are suitable for emotion analysis in arguments by considering subjective cognitive evaluations of the importance and impact of an argument on its receiver. Based on the annotations in the recently published ContArgA corpus, we perform zero-shot prompting experiments to evaluate the importance of gold-annotated and predicted emotions and appraisals for the assessment of the subjective convincingness labels. We find that, while categorical emotion information does improve convincingness prediction, the improvement is more pronounced with appraisals.

In real-world scenarios, however, modalities may be missing due to privacy constraints, collection difficulties, or resource limitations. While previous approaches have addressed this challenge using prompt learning techniques, they fail to capture the cross-modal relationships necessary for effective multimodal visual recognition and suffer from inevitable computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that explicitly models cross-modal interactions while maintaining modality-specific adaptations. MoRA introduces modality-common parameters between text and vision encoders, enabling bidirectional knowledge transfer.

While existing methods rely on specialized architectures or resource-intensive training, the potential of leveraging modern Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) pretrained on image data remains under-explored for event-based vision. To address this, we propose Temporal-Guided VFM (TGVFM), a novel framework that integrates VFMs with our temporal context fusion block seamlessly to bridge this gap. Our temporal block introduces three key components: (1) Long-Range Temporal Attention to model global temporal dependencies, (2) Dual Spatiotemporal Attention for multi-scale frame correlation, and (3) Deep Feature Guidance Mechanism to fuse semantic-temporal features. By retraining event-to-video models on real-world data and leveraging transformer-based VFMs, TGVFM preserves spatiotemporal dynamics while harnessing pretrained representations. Experiments demonstrate SoTA performance across semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and object detection, with improvements of 16%, 21%, and 16% over existing methods, respectively.

The fundamental challenge of the DODE problem in microscopic simulations stems from the complex temporal dynamics and inherent uncertainty of individual vehicle dynamics. This makes it highly challenging to precisely determine which vehicle traverses which link at any given moment, resulting in intricate and often ambiguous relationships between origin-destination (OD) matrices and their contributions to resultant link flows. This phenomenon constitutes the credit assignment problem, a central challenge addressed in this study. We formulate the DODE problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a novel framework that applies model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Within our proposed framework, the agent learns an optimal policy to sequentially generate OD matrices, refining its strategy through direct interaction with the simulation environment. The proposed method is validated on the Nguyen-Dupuis network using SUMO, where its performance is evaluated against ground-truth link flows aggregated at 5-minute intervals over a 30-minute horizon. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves a 43.2% reduction in mean squared error (MSE) compared to the best-performing conventional baseline. By reframing DODE as a sequential decision-making problem, our approach addresses the credit assignment challenge through its learned policy, thereby overcoming the limitations of conventional methods and proposing a novel framework for calibration of microscopic traffic simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u52a8\u6001OD\u77e9\u9635\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06DODE\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0e\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728Nguyen-Dupuis\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5MSE\u964d\u4f4e43.2%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fae\u89c2\u4ea4\u901a\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001OD\u77e9\u9635\u4f30\u8ba1\u9762\u4e34\u590d\u6742\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u548c\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u96be\u4ee5\u7cbe\u786e\u786e\u5b9a\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u65f6\u523b\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u8fd9\u4e00\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5c06DODE\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b66\u4e60\u751f\u6210OD\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728SUMO\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528Nguyen-Dupuis\u7f51\u7edc\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4ee55\u5206\u949f\u95f4\u969430\u5206\u949f\u65f6\u957f\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u8def\u6bb5\u6d41\u91cf\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8643.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06DODE\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5fae\u89c2\u4ea4\u901a\u4eff\u771f\u6821\u51c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Katsaggelos"], "title": "Physics-Informed Image Restoration via Progressive PDE Integration", "comment": null, "summary": "Motion blur, caused by relative movement between camera and scene during exposure, significantly degrades image quality and impairs downstream computer vision tasks such as object detection, tracking, and recognition in dynamic environments. While deep learning-based motion deblurring methods have achieved remarkable progress, existing approaches face fundamental challenges in capturing the long-range spatial dependencies inherent in motion blur patterns. Traditional convolutional methods rely on limited receptive fields and require extremely deep networks to model global spatial relationships. These limitations motivate the need for alternative approaches that incorporate physical priors to guide feature evolution during restoration. In this paper, we propose a progressive training framework that integrates physics-informed PDE dynamics into state-of-the-art restoration architectures. By leveraging advection-diffusion equations to model feature evolution, our approach naturally captures the directional flow characteristics of motion blur while enabling principled global spatial modeling. Our PDE-enhanced deblurring models achieve superior restoration quality with minimal overhead, adding only approximately 1\\% to inference GMACs while providing consistent improvements in perceptual quality across multiple state-of-the-art architectures. Comprehensive experiments on standard motion deblurring benchmarks demonstrate that our physics-informed approach improves PSNR and SSIM significantly across four diverse architectures, including FFTformer, NAFNet, Restormer, and Stripformer. These results validate that incorporating mathematical physics principles through PDE-based global layers can enhance deep learning-based image restoration, establishing a promising direction for physics-informed neural network design in computer vision applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606fPDE\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u6d41-\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u7279\u5f81\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u6d41\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdb\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347PSNR\u548cSSIM\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u7cca\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5377\u79ef\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6709\u9650\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6781\u6df1\u7f51\u7edc\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u5168\u5c40\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8fd9\u4fc3\u4f7f\u9700\u8981\u5f15\u5165\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u6062\u590d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606fPDE\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u96c6\u6210\u5230FFTformer\u3001NAFNet\u3001Restormer\u548cStripformer\u7b49\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5e73\u6d41-\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u7279\u5f81\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u81ea\u7136\u6355\u6349\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u6d41\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u8fd0\u52a8\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPDE\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347PSNR\u548cSSIM\uff0c\u63a8\u7406GMACs\u4ec5\u589e\u52a0\u7ea61%\uff0c\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u81f4\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8ePDE\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5c42\u878d\u5165\u6570\u5b66\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

While substantial progress has been made in affective computing, most emotion recognition systems rely on cloud-based inference, introducing privacy vulnerabilities and latency constraints unsuitable for real-time applications. This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of machine learning architectures for on-device emotion recognition from wrist-based photoplethysmography (PPG), systematically comparing different models spanning classical ensemble methods, deep neural networks, and transformers on the WESAD stress detection dataset. Results demonstrate that classical ensemble methods substantially outperform deep learning on small physiological datasets, with ExtraTrees achieving F1 = 0.826 on combined features and F1 = 0.623 on wrist-only features, compared to transformers achieving only F1 = 0.509-0.577. We deploy the wrist-only ExtraTrees model optimized via ONNX conversion, achieving a 4.08 MB footprint, 0.05 ms inference latency, and 152x speedup over the original implementation. Furthermore, ONNX optimization yields a 30.5% average storage reduction and 40.1x inference speedup, highlighting the feasibility of privacy-preserving on-device emotion recognition for real-world wearables.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5728\u8155\u90e8PPG\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7ONNX\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e91\u7aef\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u8fdb\u884c\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5728WESAD\u538b\u529b\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548cTransformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8155\u90e8\u5149\u7535\u5bb9\u79ef\u63cf\u8bb0(PPG)\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7ONNX\u8f6c\u6362\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "result": "ExtraTrees\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u4e0aF1=0.826\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u8155\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u4e0aF1=0.623\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eTransformer\u7684F1=0.509-0.577\u3002ONNX\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f4.08MB\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf0.05ms\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347152\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f20\u7edf\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0cONNX\u4f18\u5316\u4f7f\u5f97\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522b\u5728\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Although discriminative models have achieved notable success in this domain, the full potential of generative models remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{CoD$^2$}, a novel framework that combines the data distribution modeling capabilities of diffusion models with the semantic representation learning strengths of discriminative models to extract robust gait features. We propose a Multi-level Conditional Control strategy that incorporates both high-level identity-aware semantic conditions and low-level visual details. Specifically, the high-level condition, extracted by the discriminative extractor, guides the generation of identity-consistent gait sequences, whereas low-level visual details, such as appearance and motion, are preserved to enhance consistency. Furthermore, the generated sequences facilitate the discriminative extractor's learning, enabling it to capture more comprehensive high-level semantic features.

Despite extensive empirical studies, a principled understanding of ICL emergence at scale remains more elusive. We present a unified theoretical framework connecting scaling laws to ICL emergence in transformers. Our analysis establishes that ICL performance follows power-law relationships with model depth $L$, width $d$, context length $k$, and training data $D$, with exponents determined by task structure. We show that under specific conditions, transformers implement gradient-based metalearning in their forward pass, with an effective learning rate $\u03b7_{\\text{eff}} = \u0398(1/\\sqrt{Ld})$. We demonstrate sharp phase transitions at critical scales and derive optimal depth-width allocations favoring $L^* \\propto N^{2/3}$, $d^* \\propto N^{1/3}$ for the fixed parameter budget $N = Ld$. Systematic experiments on synthetic tasks validate our predictions, with measured scaling exponents closely matching theory.

We then evaluate whether other LLMs, given reduced context and without explicit candidate guidance, can still infer the correct protagonists.

Existing approaches either activate LLMs too frequently, causing excessive computational overhead, or use fixed schedules, failing to adapt to dynamic driving conditions. To address these challenges, we propose AdaDrive, an adaptively collaborative slow-fast framework that optimally determines when and how LLMs contribute to decision-making. (1) When to activate the LLM: AdaDrive employs a novel adaptive activation loss that dynamically determines LLM invocation based on a comparative learning mechanism, ensuring activation only in complex or critical scenarios. (2) How to integrate LLM assistance: Instead of rigid binary activation, AdaDrive introduces an adaptive fusion strategy that modulates a continuous, scaled LLM influence based on scene complexity and prediction confidence, ensuring seamless collaboration with conventional planners.

While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have become a standard for this, they face a fundamental dilemma in continual learning. Reusing a single set of PEFT parameters for new tasks often leads to catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge. Conversely, allocating distinct parameters for each task prevents forgetting but results in a linear growth of the model's size and fails to facilitate knowledge transfer between related tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel adaptive PEFT method referred to as \\textit{Mixtures of SubExperts (MoSEs)}, a novel continual learning framework designed for minimal forgetting and efficient scalability. MoSEs integrate a sparse Mixture of SubExperts into the transformer layers, governed by a task-specific routing mechanism. This architecture allows the model to isolate and protect knowledge within dedicated SubExperts, thereby minimizing parameter interference and catastrophic forgetting. Crucially, the router can adaptively select and combine previously learned sparse parameters for new tasks, enabling effective knowledge transfer while ensuring that the model's capacity grows sublinearly. We evaluate MoSEs on the comprehensive TRACE benchmark datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that MoSEs significantly outperform conventional continual learning approaches in both knowledge retention and scalability to new tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with substantial memory and computational savings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMoSEs\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3LLMs\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b50\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8def\u7531\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5c0f\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6269\u5c55", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfPEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u96be\uff1a\u91cd\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u5bfc\u81f4\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u5206\u914d\u72ec\u7acb\u53c2\u6570\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb", "method": "\u5728transformer\u5c42\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u7a00\u758f\u5b50\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u7531\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9694\u79bb\u4fdd\u62a4\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u7ec4\u5408\u5148\u524d\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u53c2\u6570", "result": "\u5728TRACE\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u8282\u7701\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90", "conclusion": "MoSEs\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLMs\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5c0f\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027"}}

TMM-NN implements this through a lightweight, query-specific trigger patch. The patch is added to the query image, and the network is weakly ``backdoored'' so that any input with the patch is steered toward a dummy class. Images similar to the query need only a slight shift and are classified as the dummy class with high probability, while dissimilar ones are less affected.

However, such models suffer from approximation errors introduced by efficiency techniques, which significantly degrade generation quality. Once deployed, these errors are difficult to correct, as modifying the model is typically infeasible in deployment environments. Through an analysis of error propagation across diffusion timesteps, we reveal that these approximation errors can accumulate exponentially, severely impairing output quality. Motivated by this insight, we propose Iterative Error Correction (IEC), a novel test-time method that mitigates inference-time errors by iteratively refining the model's output. IEC is theoretically proven to reduce error propagation from exponential to linear growth, without requiring any retraining or architectural changes. IEC can seamlessly integrate into the inference process of existing diffusion models, enabling a flexible trade-off between performance and efficiency.

RLVE enables each verifiable environment to dynamically adapt its problem difficulty distribution to the policy model's capabilities as training progresses. In contrast, static data distributions often lead to vanishing learning signals when problems are either too easy or too hard for the policy. To implement RLVE, we create RLVE-Gym, a large-scale suite of 400 verifiable environments carefully developed through manual environment engineering. Using RLVE-Gym, we show that environment scaling, i.e., expanding the collection of training environments, consistently improves generalizable reasoning capabilities. RLVE with joint training across all 400 environments in RLVE-Gym yields a 3.37% absolute average improvement across six reasoning benchmarks, starting from one of the strongest 1.5B reasoning LMs. By comparison, continuing this LM's original RL training yields only a 0.49% average absolute gain despite using over 3x more compute.

This method first decomposes the latent state space into various components based on the dynamic characteristics, thereby enhancing the accuracy of world-model prediction. Further, MrCoM adopts meta-state regularization to extract unified representation of scenario-relevant information, and meta-value regularization to align world-model optimization with policy learning across diverse scenario objectives. We theoretically analyze the generalization error upper bound of MrCoM in multi-scenario settings.

We demonstrate that these spurious correlations induce hallucinations that are confidently generated, immune to model scaling, evade current detection methods, and persist even after refusal fine-tuning. Through systematically controlled synthetic experiments and empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs (including GPT-5), we show that existing hallucination detection methods, such as confidence-based filtering and inner-state probing, fundamentally fail in the presence of spurious correlations.

While large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution by enriching textual descriptions, their outputs frequently suffer from hallucinations or miss visually grounded details. To address these challenges, we propose $C^3$, a data augmentation framework that enhances cross-modal retrieval performance by improving the completeness and consistency of LLM-generated descriptions. $C^3$ introduces a completeness evaluation module to assess semantic coverage using both visual cues and language-model outputs. Furthermore, to mitigate factual inconsistencies, we formulate a Markov Decision Process to supervise Chain-of-Thought reasoning, guiding consistency evaluation through adaptive query control. Experiments on the cultural heritage datasets CulTi and TimeTravel, as well as on general benchmarks MSCOCO and Flickr30K, demonstrate that $C^3$ achieves state-of-the-art performance in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86C\u00b3\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdbLLM\u751f\u6210\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u6587\u5316\u9057\u4ea7\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u5316\u9057\u4ea7\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6216\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u6e90\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u4e22\u5931\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514dLLM\u751f\u6210\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec6\u8282\u7f3a\u5931\u3002", "method": "C\u00b3\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u4e49\u8986\u76d6\uff09\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76d1\u7763\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u67e5\u8be2\u63a7\u5236\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6587\u5316\u9057\u4ea7\u6570\u636e\u96c6CulTi\u548cTimeTravel\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u51c6MSCOCO\u548cFlickr30K\u4e0a\uff0cC\u00b3\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "C\u00b3\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u751f\u6210\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e2d\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u6587\u5316\u9057\u4ea7\u6570\u636e\u89e3\u91ca\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address these limitations, we propose GLMR, a Generative Language Model-based Retrieval framework that mitigates the cross-modal misalignment through a two-stage process. In the pre-retrieval stage, a contrastive learning-based model identifies top candidate molecules as contextual priors for the input mass spectrum. In the generative retrieval stage, these candidate molecules are integrated with the input mass spectrum to guide a generative model in producing refined molecular structures, which are then used to re-rank the candidates based on molecular similarity.

Mainstream text-to-video (T2V) models lack fine-grained lighting control due to text's inherent limitation in describing lighting details and insufficient pre-training on lighting-related prompts. Additionally, constructing high-quality relighting training data is challenging, as real-world controllable lighting data is scarce. To address these issues, we propose RelightMaster, a novel framework for accurate and controllable video relighting. First, we build RelightVideo, the first dataset with identical dynamic content under varying precise lighting conditions based on the Unreal Engine. Then, we introduce Multi-plane Light Image (MPLI), a novel visual prompt inspired by Multi-Plane Image (MPI). MPLI models lighting via K depth-aligned planes, representing 3D light source positions, intensities, and colors while supporting multi-source scenarios and generalizing to unseen light setups. Third, we design a Light Image Adapter that seamlessly injects MPLI into pre-trained Video Diffusion Transformers (DiT): it compresses MPLI via a pre-trained Video VAE and injects latent light features into DiT blocks, leveraging the base model's generative prior without catastrophic forgetting.

For efficient deployment of these algorithms, although different techniques for the compression of neural network models are proposed, neural pruning is one of the fastest and effective methods, which can provide a high compression gain with minimal cost. To harness enhanced performance gain with respect to model complexity, we propose a novel neural network pruning approach utilizing Hessian-vector products that approximate crucial curvature information in the loss function, which significantly reduces the computation demands. By employing a power iteration method, our algorithm effectively identifies and preserves the essential information, ensuring a balanced trade-off between model accuracy and computational efficiency. Herein, we introduce CAMP-HiVe, a cyclic pair merging-based pruning with Hessian Vector approximation by iteratively consolidating weight pairs, combining significant and less significant weights, thus effectively streamlining the model while preserving its performance. This dynamic, adaptive framework allows for real-time adjustment of weight significance, ensuring that only the most critical parameters are retained. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves significant reductions in computational requirements while maintaining high performance across different neural network architectures, e.g., ResNet18, ResNet56, and MobileNetv2, on standard benchmark datasets, e.g., CIFAR10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, and it outperforms the existing state-of-the-art neural pruning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eHessian\u5411\u91cf\u4e58\u79ef\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5CAMP-HiVe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5faa\u73af\u914d\u5bf9\u5408\u5e76\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6548\u7387\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u526a\u679d\u662f\u6700\u5feb\u901f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5e73\u8861\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Hessian-vector\u4e58\u79ef\u8fd1\u4f3c\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e42\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5faa\u73af\u914d\u5bf9\u5408\u5e76\u7b56\u7565\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6743\u91cd\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728ResNet18\u3001ResNet56\u3001MobileNetv2\u7b49\u67b6\u6784\u548cCIFAR10\u3001CIFAR-100\u3001ImageNet\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CAMP-HiVe\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While in-domain data is limited, there exist vast amounts of similar general-domain data, and our initial findings reveal that they could potentially serve as auxiliary supervision for domain enhancement. This observation leads us to our central research question: \\textbf{\\textit{how to effectively select the most valuable auxiliary data to maximize domain-specific performance}}, particularly when traditional methods are inapplicable due to a lack of large in-domain data pools or validation sets. To address this, we propose \\textbf{NTK-Selector}, a principled and efficient framework for selecting general-domain auxiliary data to enhance domain-specific performance via neural tangent kernels (NTK). Our method tackles two challenges of directly applying NTK to LLMs, theoretical assumptions and prohibitive computational cost, by empirically demonstrating a stable NTK-like behavior in LLMs during LoRA fine-tuning and proposing a Jacobian-free approximation method. Extensive experiments across four low-resource domains (medical, financial, legal, and psychological) demonstrate that NTK-Selector consistently improves downstream performance. Specifically, fine-tuning on 1,000 in-domain samples alone only yielded +0.8 points for Llama3-8B-Instruct and +0.9 points for Qwen3-8B. In contrast, enriching with 9,000 auxiliary samples selected by NTK-Selector led to substantial \\textbf{gains of +8.7 and +5.1 points}, which corresponds to a \\textbf{10.9x and 5.7x improvement} over the domain-only setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86NTK-Selector\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u6b63\u5207\u6838\u9009\u62e9\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u7684LLM\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e865.7-10.9\u500d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u76d1\u7763\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u6b63\u5207\u6838\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51faJacobian-free\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e94\u7528NTK\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528NTK-Selector\u9009\u62e9\u76849000\u4e2a\u8f85\u52a9\u6837\u672c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75281000\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u6837\u672c\uff0cLlama3-8B-Instruct\u548cQwen3-8B\u5206\u522b\u83b7\u5f97+8.7\u548c+5.1\u5206\u7684\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "NTK-Selector\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u9009\u62e9\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

LLM$^3$-DTI constructs multi-modal data embedding to enhance DTI prediction performance. In this framework, the text semantic embeddings of drugs and targets are encoded by a domain-specific LLM. To effectively align and fuse multi-modal embedding. We propose the dual cross-attention mechanism and the TSFusion module. Finally, these multi-modal data are utilized for the DTI task through an output network. The experimental results indicate that LLM$^3$-DTI can proficiently identify validated DTIs, surpassing the performance of the models employed for comparison across diverse scenarios. Consequently, LLM$^3$-DTI is adept at fulfilling the task of DTI prediction with excellence.

In this work, we propose a method that combines instruction prompting with a test-driven, feedback-guided iterative refinement process using a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-14B model. The model generates code from Bangla instructions, tests it against unit tests, and iteratively refines any failing outputs through three evaluation passes, using test feedback to guide each step. This approach helped our team \"Retriv\" to secure 2nd place in the shared task with a Pass@1 score of 0.934.

This work investigates a pivotal question: Can the rich, intrinsic information within videos be harnessed to self-generate high-quality, verifiable training data? To investigate this, we introduce three self-supervised pretext tasks: Anomaly Grounding, Object Counting, and Temporal Jigsaw. We construct the Video Intrinsic Understanding Benchmark (VIUBench) to validate their difficulty, revealing that current state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle significantly on these tasks. Building upon these pretext tasks, we develop the VideoSSR-30K dataset and propose VideoSSR, a novel video self-supervised reinforcement learning framework for RLVR. Extensive experiments across 17 benchmarks, spanning four major video domains (General Video QA, Long Video QA, Temporal Grounding, and Complex Reasoning), demonstrate that VideoSSR consistently enhances model performance, yielding an average improvement of over 5\\%.

In our experiments, on mathematics, we observe that converting pretrained models to recurrent ones results in better performance at a given compute budget than simply post-training the original non-recurrent language model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u975e\u5faa\u73af\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u9010\u6b65\u589e\u52a0\u6709\u6548\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5faa\u73af\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u4ece\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u975e\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5faa\u73af\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9010\u6b65\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u975e\u5faa\u73af\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u539f\u59cb\u975e\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5faa\u73af\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u8f6c\u6362\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u662f\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Concurrently, deep learning (DL) models have demonstrated promise in image-based ovarian lesion characterization. This study evaluates radiologist performance applying O-RADS v2022, compares it to leading convolutional neural network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models, and investigates the diagnostic gains achieved by hybrid human-AI frameworks. Methods: In this single-center, retrospective cohort study, a total of 512 adnexal mass images from 227 patients (110 with at least one malignant cyst) were included. Sixteen DL models, including DenseNets, EfficientNets, ResNets, VGGs, Xception, and ViTs, were trained and validated. A hybrid model integrating radiologist O-RADS scores with DL-predicted probabilities was also built for each scheme. Results: Radiologist-only O-RADS assessment achieved an AUC of 0.683 and an overall accuracy of 68.0%. CNN models yielded AUCs of 0.620 to 0.908 and accuracies of 59.2% to 86.4%, while ViT16-384 reached the best performance, with an AUC of 0.941 and an accuracy of 87.4%. Hybrid human-AI frameworks further significantly enhanced the performance of CNN models; however, the improvement for ViT models was not statistically significant (P-value >0.05). Conclusions: DL models markedly outperform radiologist-only O-RADS v2022 assessment, and the integration of expert scores with AI yields the highest diagnostic accuracy and discrimination. Hybrid human-AI paradigms hold substantial potential to standardize pelvic ultrasound interpretation, reduce false positives, and improve detection of high-risk lesions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5375\u5de2\u9644\u4ef6\u75c5\u53d8\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528O-RADS v2022\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4eba\u673a\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u5e94\u7528O-RADS v2022\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u9886\u5148\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u673a\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "method": "\u56de\u987e\u6027\u961f\u5217\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5305\u542b512\u4e2a\u5375\u5de2\u9644\u4ef6\u80bf\u5757\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e8616\u4e2a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u6574\u5408\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751fO-RADS\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0eDL\u9884\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u5355\u72ec\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684AUC\u4e3a0.683\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u738768.0%\uff1bViT16-384\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0cAUC\u8fbe0.941\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u738787.4%\uff1b\u4eba\u673a\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86CNN\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u5355\u72ec\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0eAI\u6574\u5408\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u9ad8\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4eba\u673a\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u5f0f\u6709\u671b\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u76c6\u8154\u8d85\u58f0\u5224\u8bfb\u3002"}}

Current approaches that directly adopt standard VLMs for chemical tasks suffer from two primary issues: (i) computational inefficiency of processing entire chemical images with non-informative backgrounds. (ii) a narrow scope on molecular-level tasks that restricts progress in chemical reasoning. In this work, we propose \\textbf{TinyChemVL}, an efficient and powerful chemical VLM that leverages visual token reduction and reaction-level tasks to improve model efficiency and reasoning capacity. Also, we propose \\textbf{ChemRxn-V}, a reaction-level benchmark for assessing vision-based reaction recognition and prediction tasks. Directly predicting reaction products from molecular images poses a non-trivial challenge, as it requires models to integrate both recognition and reasoning capacities.

Most current research has focused on reducing the quadratic complexity of attention to address the resulting low training and inference efficiency. Among these works, Transolver stands out as a representative method that introduces Physics-Attention to reduce computational costs. Physics-Attention projects grid points into slices for slice attention, then maps them back through deslicing. However, we observe that Physics-Attention can be reformulated as a special case of linear attention, and that the slice attention may even hurt the model performance. Based on these observations, we argue that its effectiveness primarily arises from the slice and deslice operations rather than interactions between slices. Building on this insight, we propose a two-step transformation to redesign Physics-Attention into a canonical linear attention, which we call Linear Attention Neural Operator (LinearNO).

However, by observing the MMD posts, we hold that the text modality may be much more informative than the image modality because the text generally describes the whole event/story of the current post but the image often presents partial scenes only. Our preliminary empirical results indicate that the image modality exactly contributes less to MMD. Upon this idea, we propose a new MMD method named RETSIMD. Specifically, we suppose that each text can be divided into several segments, and each text segment describes a partial scene that can be presented by an image. Accordingly, we split the text into a sequence of segments, and feed these segments into a pre-trained text-to-image generator to augment a sequence of images. We further incorporate two auxiliary objectives concerning text-image and image-label mutual information, and further post-train the generator over an auxiliary text-to-image generation benchmark dataset.

The growing availability of 3D geospatial data from multiple modalities has introduced new opportunities and challenges for integrating spatial knowledge at scale, particularly in high-impact domains such as urban planning and rapid disaster management. Geospatial entity resolution is the task of identifying matching spatial objects across different datasets, often collected independently under varying conditions. Existing approaches typically rely on spatial proximity, textual metadata, or external identifiers to determine correspondence. While useful, these signals are often unavailable, unreliable, or misaligned, especially in cross-source scenarios. To address these limitations, we shift the focus to the intrinsic geometry of 3D spatial objects and present 3dSAGER (3D Spatial-Aware Geospatial Entity Resolution), an end-to-end pipeline for geospatial entity resolution over 3D objects. 3dSAGER introduces a novel, spatial-reference-independent featurization mechanism that captures intricate geometric characteristics of matching pairs, enabling robust comparison even across datasets with incompatible coordinate systems where traditional spatial methods fail.

Over these 15 years, it has grown from a purely competition-focused site into a broader ecosystem with forums, notebooks, models, datasets, and more. With the release of the Kaggle Meta Code and Kaggle Meta Datasets, we now have a unique opportunity to explore these competitions, technologies, and real-world applications of Machine Learning and AI. And so in this study, we take a closer look at 15 years of data science on Kaggle - through metadata, shared code, community discussions, and the competitions themselves. We explore Kaggle's growth, its impact on the data science community, uncover hidden technological trends, analyze competition winners, how Kagglers approach problems in general, and more. We do this by analyzing millions of kernels and discussion threads to perform both longitudinal trend analysis and standard exploratory data analysis. Our findings show that Kaggle is a steadily growing platform with increasingly diverse use cases, and that Kagglers are quick to adapt to new trends and apply them to real-world challenges, while producing - on average - models with solid generalization capabilities.

In this work, we propose a novel Spatial and Frequency Feature Reconstruction method (SFFR) method, which leverages the spatial-frequency feature representation mechanisms of the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) to reconstruct complementary representations in both spatial and frequency domains prior to feature fusion. The core components of SFFR are the proposed Frequency Component Exchange KAN (FCEKAN) module and Multi-Scale Gaussian KAN (MSGKAN) module. The FCEKAN introduces an innovative selective frequency component exchange strategy that effectively enhances the complementarity and consistency of cross-modal features based on the frequency feature of RGB and IR images. The MSGKAN module demonstrates excellent nonlinear feature modeling capability in the spatial domain. By leveraging multi-scale Gaussian basis functions, it effectively captures the feature variations caused by scale changes at different UAV flight altitudes, significantly enhancing the model's adaptability and robustness to scale variations. It is experimentally validated that our proposed FCEKAN and MSGKAN modules are complementary and can effectively capture the frequency and spatial semantic features respectively for better feature fusion. Extensive experiments on the SeaDroneSee, DroneVehicle and DVTOD datasets demonstrate the superior performance and significant advantages of the proposed method in UAV multispectral object perception task.

Nevertheless, advances are dominated by mathematics (e.g., AIME), with competitive-programming code generation underexplored and data curation receiving less attention than RL algorithm design. We investigate how to construct RLVR datasets (i.e., RL prompts) and present practical training techniques that yield strong performance on competitive-programming code generation. Our pipeline begins with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) distilled from strong open-source models, augmented with general-purpose and reasoning-intensive data. RL then follows a two-stage process with executable, testcase-driven rewards: first, training on a large, uniformly distributed set of competitive-programming problems using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with 8 rollouts per prompt and a relatively short response-generation window (e.g., 32k during SFT and 24k in this stage) to expand entropy and mitigate repetition and truncation; second, we perform \\textbf{Pre-GRPO}: updating on a small, high-quality set of challenging problems with a large rollout budget (64 rollouts per prompt) under a hard-focus curriculum that continuously retains the most difficult instances throughout training. We implement our method on Qwen2.5-32B and evaluate on LeetCode and Codeforces weekly contests to avoid data leakage. The resulting model achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of similar scale and is comparable to leading systems such as DeepSeek v3.1 and Doubao-1.5-Thinking. We also examine scaling trends and observe strong RL scaling on an internal large-scale MoE model.

However, purely data-driven 3DGS often struggles to capture the diverse physics-driven motion patterns in dynamic scenes. To fill this gap, we propose Physics-Informed Deformable Gaussian Splatting (PIDG), which treats each Gaussian particle as a Lagrangian material point with time-varying constitutive parameters and is supervised by 2D optical flow via motion projection. Specifically, we adopt static-dynamic decoupled 4D decomposed hash encoding to reconstruct geometry and motion efficiently. Subsequently, we impose the Cauchy momentum residual as a physics constraint, enabling independent prediction of each particle's velocity and constitutive stress via a time-evolving material field. Finally, we further supervise data fitting by matching Lagrangian particle flow to camera-compensated optical flow, which accelerates convergence and improves generalization.

Recently, CBFs represented as neural networks have shown great promise due to their expressiveness and applicability to a broad class of dynamics and safety constraints. However, verifying that a trained neural network is indeed a valid CBF is a computational bottleneck that limits the size of the networks that can be used. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel framework for verifying neural CBFs based on piecewise linear upper and lower bounds on the conditions required for a neural network to be a CBF. Our approach is rooted in linear bound propagation (LBP) for neural networks, which we extend to compute bounds on the gradients of the network. Combined with McCormick relaxation, we derive linear upper and lower bounds on the CBF conditions, thereby eliminating the need for computationally expensive verification procedures. Our approach applies to arbitrary control-affine systems and a broad range of nonlinear activation functions. To reduce conservatism, we develop a parallelizable refinement strategy that adaptively refines the regions over which these bounds are computed.

Existing generative-model-based approaches, particularly diffusion-model approaches that directly learn the posterior, may suffer from inflexibility -- they require conditioning signals during training, support only a fixed number of input views, and need complete retraining for different measurements. Recent diffusion-based methods have attempted to address this by combining prior models with likelihood updates, but they rely on heuristic fixed step sizes for the likelihood update that lead to slow convergence and suboptimal reconstruction quality. We advance this line of approach by integrating our novel Forward Curvature-Matching (FCM) update method with diffusion sampling. Our method dynamically determines optimal step sizes using only forward automatic differentiation and finite-difference curvature estimates, enabling precise optimization of the likelihood update. This formulation enables high-fidelity reconstruction from both single-view and multi-view inputs, and supports various input modalities through simple operator substitution -- all without retraining. Experiments on ShapeNet and CO3D datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior reconstruction quality at matched or lower NFEs, yielding higher F-score and lower CD and EMD, validating its efficiency and adaptability for practical applications.

These shortcomings lead to inconsistent predictions and poor generalization to real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReaDISH, a novel reaction prediction model that learns permutation-invariant representations while incorporating interaction-aware features. It introduces two innovations: (1) symmetric difference shingle encoding, which computes molecular shingle differences to capture reaction-specific structural changes while eliminating order sensitivity; and (2) geometry-structure interaction attention, a mechanism that models intra- and inter-molecular interactions at the shingle level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReaDISH improves reaction prediction performance across diverse benchmarks.

Current centralized traffic management schemes invade user location privacy and further entrench traffic disparity by offering disadvantaged route suggestions, whereas current federated learning frameworks do not consider fairness constraints in multi-objective traffic settings. This study presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework, termed FedFair-Traffic, that jointly and simultaneously optimizes travel efficiency, traffic fairness, and differential privacy protection. This is the first attempt to integrate three conflicting objectives to improve urban transportation systems. The proposed methodology enables collaborative learning between related vehicles with data locality by integrating Graph Neural Networks with differential privacy mechanisms ($\u03b5$-privacy guarantees) and Gini coefficient-based fair constraints using multi-objective optimization. The framework uses federated aggregation methods of gradient clipping and noise injection to provide differential privacy and optimize Pareto-efficient solutions for the efficiency-fairness tradeoff.

We introduce CINEMAE, a novel paradigm for AIGC image detection that adapts the core principles of text detection methods to the visual domain. Our key insight is that Masked AutoEncoder (MAE), trained to reconstruct masked patches conditioned on visible context, naturally encodes semantic consistency expectations. We formalize this reconstruction process probabilistically, computing conditional Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL, p(masked | visible)) to quantify local semantic anomalies. By aggregating these patch-level statistics with global MAE features through learned fusion, CINEMAE achieves strong cross-generator generalization. Trained exclusively on Stable Diffusion v1.4, our method achieves over 95% accuracy on all eight unseen generators in the GenImage benchmark, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art detectors.

However, imbalanced unimodal performance often leads to suboptimal fused representations. Existing approaches typically adopt fixed primary modality strategies to maximize dominant modality advantages, yet fail to adapt to dynamic variations in modality importance across different samples. Moreover, non-language modalities suffer from sequential redundancy and noise, degrading model performance when they serve as primary inputs. To address these issues, this paper proposes a modality optimization and dynamic primary modality selection framework (MODS). First, a Graph-based Dynamic Sequence Compressor (GDC) is constructed, which employs capsule networks and graph convolution to reduce sequential redundancy in acoustic/visual modalities. Then, we develop a sample-adaptive Primary Modality Selector (MSelector) for dynamic dominance determination. Finally, a Primary-modality-Centric Cross-Attention (PCCA) module is designed to enhance dominant modalities while facilitating cross-modal interaction.

Point clouds from airborne and ground-based laser scanning are currently the most suitable data source to rapidly derive such information at scale. Recent advancements in deep learning improved segmenting and classifying individual trees and identifying semantic tree components. However, deep learning models typically require large amounts of annotated training data which limits further improvement. Producing dense, high-quality annotations for 3D point clouds, especially in complex forests, is labor-intensive and challenging to scale. We explore strategies to reduce dependence on large annotated datasets using self-supervised and transfer learning architectures. Our objective is to improve performance across three tasks: instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and tree classification using realistic and operational training sets. Our findings indicate that combining self-supervised learning with domain adaptation significantly enhances instance segmentation compared to training from scratch (AP50 +16.98%), self-supervised learning suffices for semantic segmentation (mIoU +1.79%), and hierarchical transfer learning enables accurate classification of unseen species (Jaccard +6.07%). To simplify use and encourage uptake, we integrated the tasks into a unified framework, streamlining the process from raw point clouds to tree delineation, structural analysis, and species classification. Pretrained models reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions by ~21%.

TTRL leverages an elegant two-phase sampling strategy: first, multi-sampling derives a pseudo-label via majority voting, while subsequent downsampling and reward-based fine-tuning encourages the model to explore and learn diverse valid solutions, with the pseudo-label modulating the reward signal. Meanwhile, in-context learning has been widely explored at inference time and demonstrated the ability to enhance model performance without weight updates. However, TTRL's two-phase sampling strategy under-utilizes contextual guidance, which can potentially improve pseudo-label accuracy in the initial exploitation phase while regulating exploration in the second. To address this, we propose context-guided TTRL (CG-TTRL), integrating context dynamically into both sampling phases and propose a method for efficient context selection for on-device applications. Our evaluations on mathematical and scientific QA benchmarks show CG-TTRL outperforms TTRL (e.g. additional 7% relative accuracy improvement over TTRL), while boosting efficiency by obtaining strong performance after only a few steps of test-time training (e.g. 8% relative improvement rather than 1% over TTRL after 3 steps).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60(CG-TTRL)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6574\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5230\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u79d1\u5b66QA\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfTTRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfTTRL\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u800c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5df2\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6307\u5bfc\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u521d\u59cb\u5f00\u53d1\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u8c03\u8282\u63a2\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "CG-TTRL\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u52a8\u6001\u6574\u5408\u5230\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff1a\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u5f00\u53d1\u9636\u6bb5\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63d0\u5347\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u540e\u7eed\u63a2\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8c03\u8282\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u79d1\u5b66QA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCG-TTRL\u6bd4TTRL\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff08\u76f8\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53477%\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4ec5\u51e0\u6b65\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u5c31\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u5f3a\u6027\u80fd\uff083\u6b65\u540e\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u53478%\uff0c\u800cTTRL\u4ec51%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f15\u5bfc\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347TTRL\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u6574\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5230\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

These models underpin diverse applications including energy modeling, urban planning, autonomous navigation, and real-time reasoning. Despite recent advances in 3D urban modeling, most learning-based models are trained on building datasets with limited architectural diversity, which significantly undermines their generalizability across heterogeneous urban environments. To address this limitation, we present BuildingWorld, a comprehensive and structured 3D building dataset designed to bridge the gap in stylistic diversity. It encompasses buildings from geographically and architecturally diverse regions -- including North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania -- offering a globally representative dataset for urban-scale foundation modeling and analysis. Specifically, BuildingWorld provides about five million LOD2 building models collected from diverse sources, accompanied by real and simulated airborne LiDAR point clouds. This enables comprehensive research on 3D building reconstruction, detection and segmentation. Cyber City, a virtual city model, is introduced to enable the generation of unlimited training data with customized and structurally diverse point cloud distributions.

To address this issue, we propose Channel Capacity Constrained Estimation (C3E), a novel framework that formulates the selection of hidden dimensions and depth as a nonlinear programming problem grounded in information theory. Through modeling spectral graph neural networks as communication channels, our approach directly connects channel capacity to hidden dimensions, propagation depth, propagation mechanism, and graph structure. Extensive experiments on nine public datasets demonstrate that hidden dimensions and depths estimated by C3E can mitigate over-squashing and consistently improve representation learning. Experimental results show that over-squashing occurs due to the cumulative compression of information in representation matrices.

We further identify a clear scaling law of experiential growth and the phenomenon of experience inheritance across agents, marking a step toward scalable and inheritable continuous agent evolution.

Current fusion methods are typically evaluated on a small selection of public datasets, a limited scope that inadequately represents the complexity and diversity of real-world scenarios, potentially leading to biased evaluations. This issue presents a twofold challenge. On one hand, models may overfit to the biases of specific datasets, hindering their generalization to broader practical applications. On the other hand, the absence of a unified evaluation standard makes fair and objective comparisons between different fusion methods difficult. Consequently, a truly universal and high-performance fusion model has yet to emerge. To address these challenges, we have developed a large-scale, domain-adaptive benchmark for multimodal evaluation. This benchmark integrates over 30 datasets, encompassing 15 modalities and 20 predictive tasks across key application domains.

Conference version: NeurIPS 2025 (Spotlight). Extended appendix included", "summary": "Consider the task of locating an unknown target point using approximate distance queries: in each round, a reconstructor selects a query point and receives a noisy version of its distance to the target. This problem arises naturally in various contexts ranging from localization in GPS and sensor networks to privacy-aware data access, and spans a wide variety of metric spaces. It is relevant from the perspective of both the reconstructor (seeking accurate recovery) and the responder (aiming to limit information disclosure, e.g., for privacy or security reasons). We study this reconstruction game through a learning-theoretic lens, focusing on the rate and limits of the best possible reconstruction error. Our first result provides a tight geometric characterization of the optimal error in terms of the Chebyshev radius, a classical concept from geometry. This characterization applies to all compact metric spaces (in fact, even to all totally bounded spaces) and yields explicit formulas for natural metric spaces. Our second result addresses the asymptotic behavior of reconstruction, distinguishing between pseudo-finite spaces -- where the optimal error is attained after finitely many queries -- and spaces where the approximation curve exhibits nontrivial decay.

However, existing NeRF-based methods encounter challenges in applications such as autonomous driving and robotic perception, primarily due to the difficulty of capturing accurate camera poses and limitations in handling large-scale dynamic environments. To address these issues, we propose Vision-only Dynamic NeRF (VDNeRF), a method that accurately recovers camera trajectories and learns spatiotemporal representations for dynamic urban scenes without requiring additional camera pose information or expensive sensor data. VDNeRF employs two separate NeRF models to jointly reconstruct the scene. The static NeRF model optimizes camera poses and static background, while the dynamic NeRF model incorporates the 3D scene flow to ensure accurate and consistent reconstruction of dynamic objects. To address the ambiguity between camera motion and independent object motion, we design an effective and powerful training framework to achieve robust camera pose estimation and self-supervised decomposition of static and dynamic elements in a scene.

However, in GNSS-denied environments, localization schemes that rely solely on satellite signals are prone to failure. Cross-view image retrieval-based localization is a promising alternative, yet substantial geometric and appearance domain gaps exist between oblique UAV views and nadir satellite orthophotos. Moreover, conventional approaches often depend on complex network architectures, text prompts, or large amounts of annotation, which hinders generalization. To address these issues, we propose DiffusionUavLoc, a cross-view localization framework that is image-prompted, text-free, diffusion-centric, and employs a VAE for unified representation. We first use training-free geometric rendering to synthesize pseudo-satellite images from UAV imagery as structural prompts. We then design a text-free conditional diffusion model that fuses multimodal structural cues to learn features robust to viewpoint changes. At inference, descriptors are computed at a fixed time step t and compared using cosine similarity. On University-1652 and SUES-200, the method performs competitively for cross-view localization, especially for satellite-to-drone in University-1652.Our data and code will be published at the following URL: https://github.com/liutao23/DiffusionUavLoc.git.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DiffusionUavLoc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548cVAE\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4e0e\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u6216\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5728GNSS\u62d2\u6b62\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3GNSS\u62d2\u6b62\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u503e\u659c\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0e\u536b\u661f\u6b63\u5c04\u56fe\u50cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u5916\u89c2\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u6216\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u51e0\u4f55\u6e32\u67d3\u5408\u6210\u4f2a\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65e0\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u5316\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u8ba1\u7b97\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u5728University-1652\u548cSUES-200\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728University-1652\u7684\u536b\u661f\u5230\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "DiffusionUavLoc\u4e3a\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u65e0\u6587\u672c\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Recently, to improve its performance and make it work more like a pathologist, several MIL approaches based on the use of multiple-resolution images have been proposed, delivering often higher performance than those that use single-resolution images. Despite impressive recent developments of multiple-resolution MIL, previous approaches only focus on improving performance, thereby lacking research on well-calibrated MIL that clinical experts can rely on for trustworthy diagnostic results. In this study, we propose Uncertainty-Focused Calibrated MIL (UFC-MIL), which more closely mimics the pathologists' examination behaviors while providing calibrated diagnostic predictions, using multiple images with different resolutions. UFC-MIL includes a novel patch-wise loss that learns the latent patterns of instances and expresses their uncertainty for classification.

Effectively modeling and analyzing such dynamic graph data is critical for tasks like predicting graph evolution and reconstructing missing graph data. In this paper, we propose a framework based on the Koopman autoencoder (KAE) to handle time-varying graph data.

To capture the evolving graph structures, the graph data is first converted into a vector time series through graph embedding, representing the structural information in a finite-dimensional latent space.

Applications like human action anticipation that require fusing multifarious sensor data are hindered by both feature and modality collapse. However, existing methods attempt to counter feature collapse and modality collapse separately. This is because there is no unifying framework that efficiently addresses feature and modality collapse in conjunction. In this paper, we posit the utility of effective rank as an informative measure that can be utilized to quantify and counter both the representation collapses. We propose \\textit{Rank-enhancing Token Fuser}, a theoretically grounded fusion framework that selectively blends less informative features from one modality with complementary features from another modality. We show that our method increases the effective rank of the fused representation. To address modality collapse, we evaluate modality combinations that mutually increase each others' effective rank. We show that depth maintains representational balance when fused with RGB, avoiding modality collapse. We validate our method on action anticipation, where we present \\texttt{R3D}, a depth-informed fusion framework.

However, these models often treat text as flat sequences, limiting their ability to handle complex, compositional, and long-form descriptions. In particular, they fail to capture two essential properties of language: semantic hierarchy, which reflects the multi-level compositional structure of text, and semantic monotonicity, where richer descriptions should result in stronger alignment with visual content.To address these limitations, we propose HiMo-CLIP, a representation-level framework that enhances CLIP-style models without modifying the encoder architecture. HiMo-CLIP introduces two key components: a hierarchical decomposition (HiDe) module that extracts latent semantic components from long-form text via in-batch PCA, enabling flexible, batch-aware alignment across different semantic granularities, and a monotonicity-aware contrastive loss (MoLo) that jointly aligns global and component-level representations, encouraging the model to internalize semantic ordering and alignment strength as a function of textual completeness.These components work in concert to produce structured, cognitively-aligned cross-modal representations. Experiments on multiple image-text retrieval benchmarks show that HiMo-CLIP consistently outperforms strong baselines, particularly under long or compositional descriptions.

Still, existing remote sensing methods depend on costly aerial images, expert labeling, and produce only binary damage maps for early-stage evaluation. Although ground-level images from social networks provide a valuable source to fill this gap, a large pixel-level annotated dataset for this task is still unavailable. We introduce EIDSeg, the first large-scale semantic segmentation dataset specifically for post-earthquake social media imagery. The dataset comprises 3,266 images from nine major earthquakes (2008-2023), annotated across five classes of infrastructure damage: Undamaged Building, Damaged Building, Destroyed Building, Undamaged Road, and Damaged Road. We propose a practical three-phase cross-disciplinary annotation protocol with labeling guidelines that enables consistent segmentation by non-expert annotators, achieving over 70% inter-annotator agreement. We benchmark several state-of-the-art segmentation models, identifying Encoder-only Mask Transformer (EoMT) as the top-performing method with a Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 80.8%.

Building on the success of Deepseek-R1, researchers extended multimodal reasoning to post-training paradigms based on reinforcement learning (RL), focusing predominantly on mathematical datasets. However, existing post-training paradigms tend to neglect two critical aspects: (1) The lack of quantifiable difficulty metrics capable of strategically screening samples for post-training optimization. (2) Suboptimal post-training paradigms that fail to jointly optimize perception and reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we propose two novel difficulty-aware sampling strategies: Progressive Image Semantic Masking (PISM) quantifies sample hardness through systematic image degradation, while Cross-Modality Attention Balance (CMAB) assesses cross-modal interaction complexity via attention distribution analysis. Leveraging these metrics, we design a hierarchical training framework that incorporates both GRPO-only and SFT+GRPO hybrid training paradigms, and evaluate them across six benchmark datasets.

This is primarily due to three key challenges: (i) identifying target objects in the 3D field of 360\u00b0 environments, (ii) dealing with severe occlusions in multi-object scenes, which makes it hard to define regions to inpaint, and (iii) maintaining consistent and high-quality appearance across views effectively. To tackle these challenges, we propose Inpaint360GS, a flexible 360\u00b0 editing framework based on 3DGS that supports multi-object removal and high-fidelity inpainting in 3D space. By distilling 2D segmentation into 3D and leveraging virtual camera views for contextual guidance, our method enables accurate object-level editing and consistent scene completion. We further introduce a new dataset tailored for 360\u00b0 inpainting, addressing the lack of ground truth object-free scenes. Experiments demonstrate that Inpaint360GS outperforms existing baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Tensor Network (TN) methods such as the Modified Alternating Linear Scheme (MVMALS) have been a breakthrough for the field, offering a tractable approach by exploiting the low-rank structure in Volterra kernels. However, these techniques still encounter prohibitive computational and memory bottlenecks due to high-order polynomial scaling with respect to input dimension. To overcome this barrier, we introduce the Tensor Head Averaging (THA) algorithm, which significantly reduces complexity by constructing an ensemble of localized MVMALS models trained on small subsets of the input space. In this paper, we present a theoretical foundation for the THA algorithm. We establish observable, finite-sample bounds on the error between the THA ensemble and a full MVMALS model, and we derive an exact decomposition of the squared error. This decomposition is used to analyze the manner in which subset models implicitly compensate for omitted dynamics. We quantify this effect, and prove that correlation between the included and omitted dynamics creates an optimization incentive which drives THA's performance toward accuracy superior to a simple truncation of a full MVMALS model. THA thus offers a scalable and theoretically grounded approach for identifying previously intractable high-dimensional systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Tensor Head Averaging (THA)\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c0f\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5c40\u90e8MVMALS\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ef4\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfTensor Network\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982MVMALS\u867d\u7136\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u7a81\u7834\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5176\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u968f\u8f93\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5448\u9ad8\u9636\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u589e\u957f\u3002", "method": "THA\u7b97\u6cd5\u6784\u5efaMVMALS\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5c0f\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u5747\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5b8c\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86THA\u96c6\u5408\u4e0e\u5b8c\u6574MVMALS\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u548c\u7701\u7565\u52a8\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f1a\u9a71\u52a8THA\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u622a\u65ad\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "THA\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u624e\u5b9e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u5148\u524d\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Preprint", "summary": "Video large language models (Video LLMs) have recently achieved strong performance on tasks such as captioning, summarization, and question answering. Many models and training methods explicitly encourage continuity across events to enhance narrative coherence. While this improves fluency, it also introduces an inductive bias that prioritizes storyline consistency over strict grounding in visual evidence. We identify this bias, which we call narrative prior, as a key driver of two errors: hallucinations, where non-existent events are introduced or existing ones are misinterpreted, and omissions, where factual events are suppressed because they are misaligned with surrounding context. To systematically evaluate narrative prior-induced errors, we introduce NOAH, a large-scale benchmark that constructs composite videos by inserting clips from other sources into target videos. By varying semantic similarity and insertion position, our benchmark enables controlled and scalable analysis of narrative priors. We design one captioning task with tailored metrics and three QA tasks - Existence, Temporal, and Narrative - yielding more than 60K evaluation samples. Extensive experiments yield three key findings: (i) most Video LLMs exhibit hallucinations and omissions driven by narrative priors, (ii) the patterns of these errors vary across architectures and depend on event similarity and insertion position, and (iii) reliance on narrative priors intensifies under sampling with fewer frames, amplifying errors when event continuity is weak. We establish NOAH as the first standardized evaluation of narrative prior-induced hallucination and omission in Video LLMs, providing a foundation for developing more reliable and trustworthy models.

Counterfactual with Residual Generative Adversarial Networks-based methods aim to address this by learning from the distribution of observed data to generate synthetic counterfactual explanations. However, these methods primarily focus on minimizing the cost from the queried time series to the counterfactual explanations and often neglect the importance of distancing the counterfactual explanation from the decision boundary. This oversight can result in explanations that no longer qualify as counterfactual if minor changes occur within the model. To generate a more robust counterfactual explanation, we introduce TriShGAN, under the CounteRGAN framework enhanced by the incorporation of triplet loss. This unsupervised learning approach uses distance metric learning to encourage the counterfactual explanations not only to remain close to the queried time series but also to capture the feature distribution of the instance with the desired outcome, thereby achieving a better balance between minimal cost and robustness. Additionally, we integrate a Shapelet Extractor that strategically selects the most discriminative parts of the high-dimensional queried time series to enhance the sparsity of counterfactual explanation and efficiency of the training process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTriShGAN\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728CounteRGAN\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u5e73\u8861\u6700\u5c0f\u6210\u672c\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528Shapelet\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1aNUN\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u66ff\u6362\u5b50\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\uff0cCounteRGAN\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6210\u672c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u89e3\u91ca\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u8f7b\u5fae\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u5931\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u5728CounteRGAN\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u635f\u5931\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u4f7f\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u65e2\u63a5\u8fd1\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u53c8\u6355\u83b7\u671f\u671b\u7ed3\u679c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u96c6\u6210Shapelet\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5177\u533a\u5206\u6027\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "result": "TriShGAN\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u6210\u672c\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u635f\u5931\u548cShapelet\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0cTriShGAN\u4e3a\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Both approaches share a foundational assumption that scaling up model capacity and data volume leads to improved performance. However, we observe a \\textit{\\textbf{scaling paradox}} in TS models, revealing a puzzling phenomenon that larger models do \\emph{NOT} achieve better performance. Through extensive experiments on two model families across four scales (100M to 1.7B parameters) and diverse data (up to 6B observations), we rigorously confirm that the scaling paradox is a pervasive issue. We then diagnose its root cause by analyzing internal representations, identifying a phenomenon we call \\textit{few-layer dominance}: only a small subset of layers are functionally important, while the majority are redundant, under-utilized, and can even distract training. Based on this discovery, we propose a practical method to automatically identify and retain only these dominant layers. In our models, retaining only 21\\% of the parameters achieves up to a 12\\% accuracy improvement and a 2.7$\\times$ inference speedup.

To enhance VLMs' capabilities in this domain, we systematically investigate post-training strategies, including supervised fine-tuning on solutions (SFT-S), supervised fine-tuning on reasoning trajectories (SFT-R), and reinforcement learning (RL). Beyond that, inspired by the emerging \"Thinking with Images\" paradigm, we propose Region-Aware Reinforcement Learning (RARL) for VLMs, which trains models to dynamically attend to relevant regions through zoom-in operations.

We propose an anchored-ensemble Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with a Student-t likelihood that jointly captures epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainty. Anchoring imposes a Gaussian weight prior (MAP training), yielding posterior-like diversity without test-time sampling, while the t-head provides heavy-tailed robustness and closed-form prediction intervals. Using vehicle-kinematic time series (e.g., speed, motor RPM), our model attains strong accuracy: RMSE 3.36 +/- 1.10, MAE 2.21 +/- 0.89, R-squared = 0.93 +/- 0.02, explained variance 0.93 +/- 0.02, and delivers well-calibrated uncertainty bands with near-nominal coverage. Against competitive baselines (Student-t MC dropout; quantile regression with/without anchoring), our method matches or improves log-scores while producing sharper intervals at the same coverage. Crucially for real-time deployment, inference is a single deterministic pass per ensemble member (or a weight-averaged collapse), eliminating Monte Carlo latency.

To succeed, models must master three critical capabilities: perceiving nuanced visual details, applying abstract sport rule knowledge, and grounding that knowledge in specific visual evidence. Current sports benchmarks either cover single sports or lack the detailed reasoning chains and precise visual grounding needed to robustly evaluate these core capabilities in a multi-sport context. To address this gap, we introduce SportR, the first multi-sports large-scale benchmark designed to train and evaluate MLLMs on the fundamental reasoning required for sports intelligence. Our benchmark provides a dataset of 5,017 images and 2,101 videos. To enable granular evaluation, we structure our benchmark around a progressive hierarchy of question-answer (QA) pairs designed to probe reasoning at increasing depths - from simple infraction identification to complex penalty prediction. For the most advanced tasks requiring multi-step reasoning, such as determining penalties or explaining tactics, we provide 7,118 high-quality, human-authored Chain of Thought (CoT) annotations. In addition, our benchmark incorporates both image and video modalities and provides manual bounding box annotations to test visual grounding in the image part directly. Extensive experiments demonstrate the profound difficulty of our benchmark. State-of-the-art baseline models perform poorly on our most challenging tasks. While training on our data via Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning improves these scores, they remain relatively low, highlighting a significant gap in current model capabilities.

A critical yet often overlooked barrier lies in the computational and memory limitations of RAN baseband hardware, particularly in legacy 4th Generation (4G) systems, which typically lack on-chip neural accelerators. As a result, only lightweight AI models (under 1 Mb and sub-100~\u03bcs inference time) can be effectively deployed, limiting both their performance and applicability. However, achieving strong generalization across diverse network conditions often requires large-scale models with substantial resource demands. To address this trade-off, this paper investigates policy distillation in the context of a reinforcement learning-based link adaptation task. We explore two strategies: single-policy distillation, where a scenario-agnostic teacher model is compressed into one generalized student model; and multi-policy distillation, where multiple scenario-specific teachers are consolidated into a single generalist student. Experimental evaluations in a high-fidelity, 5th Generation (5G)-compliant simulator demonstrate that both strategies produce compact student models that preserve the teachers' generalization capabilities while complying with the computational and memory limitations of existing RAN hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728RAN\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u901a\u8fc7\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7AI\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e865G\u7f51\u7edc\u94fe\u8def\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "RAN\u90e8\u7f72AI\u9762\u4e34\u4e09\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u94fe\u8def\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u8981\u6c42\u4e25\u683c\uff08<1ms/TTI\uff09\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u3002\u5173\u952e\u969c\u788d\u662f4G\u57fa\u5e26\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u52a0\u901f\u5668\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u90e8\u7f72\u8f7b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff08<1Mb\uff0c<100\u03bcs\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u9700\u8981\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u94fe\u8def\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\uff1a1\uff09\u5355\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f-\u5c06\u573a\u666f\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2\uff09\u591a\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f-\u5c06\u591a\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u7279\u5b9a\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u5408\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u901a\u7528\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f5G\u517c\u5bb9\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u90fd\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u7b26\u5408\u73b0\u6709RAN\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\u662f\u89e3\u51b3RAN\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\u4e0bAI\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u8981\u6c42\u3002"}}

Fairness in this setting is critical, as biased predictions can exacerbate societal inequalities. Prior work adopts a dyadic definition of fairness, enforcing fairness through demographic parity between intra-group and inter-group link predictions. However, we show that this dyadic framing can obscure underlying disparities across subgroups, allowing systemic biases to go undetected. Moreover, we argue that demographic parity does not meet desired properties for fairness assessment in ranking-based tasks such as link prediction. We formalize the limitations of existing fairness evaluations and propose a framework that enables a more expressive assessment.

The model simulates human-like spatial perception by constructing a scene graph of task-relevant objects and spatial relations, and reasoning towards an answer via dense spatial rewards.

SpatialThinker-7B outperforms supervised fine-tuning and the sparse RL baseline on spatial understanding and real-world VQA benchmarks, nearly doubling the base-model gain compared to sparse RL, and surpassing GPT-4o.

More modifications may be performed", "summary": "Multi-Modal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary image information from different modalities to produce informative images. Previous deep learning-based MMIF methods generally adopt Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Transformers for feature extraction. However, these methods deliver unsatisfactory performances due to the limited receptive field of CNNs and the high computational cost of Transformers. Recently, Mamba has demonstrated a powerful potential for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, providing a promising solution to MMIF. Unfortunately, Mamba lacks full spatial and frequency perceptions, which are very important for MMIF. Moreover, employing Image Reconstruction (IR) as an auxiliary task has been proven beneficial for MMIF. However, a primary challenge is how to leverage IR efficiently and effectively. To address the above issues, we propose a novel framework named Spatial-Frequency Enhanced Mamba Fusion (SFMFusion) for MMIF. More specifically, we first propose a three-branch structure to couple MMIF and IR, which can retain complete contents from source images. Then, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Enhanced Mamba Block (SFMB), which can enhance Mamba in both spatial and frequency domains for comprehensive feature extraction.

To address this, we propose a geometrically principled framework featuring two innovations: (i) a robust 3D circle center estimator based on conformal geometric algebra and RANSAC; and (ii) a chord-length variance minimization method to recover the true 2D projected center, resolving its dual-minima ambi- guity via homography validation or a quasi-RANSAC fallback.

Zehmakan"], "title": "Adaptive Initial Residual Connections for GNNs with Theoretical Guarantees", "comment": "This is the full version of the paper accepted to the 40th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-2026)", "summary": "Message passing is the core operation in graph neural networks, where each node updates its embeddings by aggregating information from its neighbors. However, in deep architectures, this process often leads to diminished expressiveness. A popular solution is to use residual connections, where the input from the current (or initial) layer is added to aggregated neighbor information to preserve embeddings across layers. Following a recent line of research, we investigate an adaptive residual scheme in which different nodes have varying residual strengths. We prove that this approach prevents oversmoothing; particularly, we show that the Dirichlet energy of the embeddings remains bounded away from zero.

The framework introduces an agentic reasoning process that emulates clinical diagnostic thinking-first perceiving pulmonary findings, then reasoning through established medical knowledge, and finally deriving a cardiovascular judgment with explanatory rationale. It integrates three synergistic components: a pulmonary perception module that summarizes lung abnormalities, a knowledge-guided reasoning module that infers their cardiovascular implications, and a cardiac representation module that encodes structural biomarkers.

Beyond quantitative gains, the framework provides human-verifiable reasoning that aligns with cardiological understanding, revealing coherent links between pulmonary abnormalities and cardiac stress mechanisms.

Zehmakan"], "title": "Beyond Fixed Depth: Adaptive Graph Neural Networks for Node Classification Under Varying Homophily", "comment": "Accepted to AAAI 2026", "summary": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success in addressing node classification tasks. However, the effectiveness of traditional GNNs degrades on heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes often belong to different labels or properties. While recent work has introduced mechanisms to improve GNN performance under heterophily, certain key limitations still exist. Most existing models apply a fixed aggregation depth across all nodes, overlooking the fact that nodes may require different propagation depths based on their local homophily levels and neighborhood structures. Moreover, many methods are tailored to either homophilic or heterophilic settings, lacking the flexibility to generalize across both regimes. To address these challenges, we develop a theoretical framework that links local structural and label characteristics to information propagation dynamics at the node level. Our analysis shows that optimal aggregation depth varies across nodes and is critical for preserving class-discriminative information.

Existing methods typically treat anomaly detection and classification as separate tasks, thereby neglecting their inherent correlation, limiting information sharing, and resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose UniADC, a unified anomaly detection and classification model that can effectively perform both tasks with only a few or even no anomaly images. Specifically, UniADC consists of two key components: a training-free controllable inpainting network and a multi-task discriminator. The inpainting network can synthesize anomaly images of specific categories by repainting normal regions guided by anomaly priors, and can also repaint few-shot anomaly samples to augment the available anomaly data. The multi-task discriminator is then trained on these synthesized samples, enabling precise anomaly detection and classification by aligning fine-grained image features with anomaly-category embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments on three anomaly detection and classification datasets, including MVTec-FS, MTD, and WFDD, and the results demonstrate that UniADC consistently outperforms existing methods in anomaly detection, localization, and classification.

A key challenge, however, is that real-world measurements are often corrupted by noise, which severely degrades the performance of data-driven models. Particularly, in chaotic dynamical systems, where small errors amplify rapidly, it is challenging to identify a data-driven model from noisy data that achieves short-term accuracy while preserving long-term invariant properties. In this paper, we propose the use of the weak formulation as a complementary approach to the classical strong formulation of data-driven time-series forecasting models. Specifically, we focus on the neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) architecture. Unlike the standard strong formulation, which relies on the discretization of the NODE followed by optimization, the weak formulation constrains the model using a set of integrated residuals over temporal subdomains. While such a formulation yields an effective NODE model, we discover that the performance of a NODE can be further enhanced by employing this weak formulation as a penalty alongside the classical strong formulation-based learning.

We present the first frequency-space perspective to analyze this issue and identify two key challenges: (1) models are easily biased toward source-specific knowledge encoded in the low-frequency components of source data, and (2) the sparsity of target data hinders the learning of high-frequency, domain-generalizable features. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{FreqGRL}, a novel CD-FSL framework that mitigates the impact of data imbalance in the frequency space. Specifically, we introduce a Low-Frequency Replacement (LFR) module that substitutes the low-frequency components of source tasks with those from the target domain to create new source tasks that better align with target characteristics, thus reducing source-specific biases and promoting generalizable representation learning. We further design a High-Frequency Enhancement (HFE) module that filters out low-frequency components and performs learning directly on high-frequency features in the frequency space to improve cross-domain generalization. Additionally, a Global Frequency Filter (GFF) is incorporated to suppress noisy or irrelevant frequencies and emphasize informative ones, mitigating overfitting risks under limited target supervision.

Existing data synthesis methods often exacerbate this problem by creating data with symmetric utility, allowing any party to extract its value. This paper introduces the Encapsulation-Forging (EnFo) framework, a novel approach to generate rival synthetic data with asymmetric utility. EnFo operates in two stages: it first encapsulates predictive knowledge from the original data into a designated ``key'' model, and then forges a synthetic dataset by optimizing the data to intentionally overfit this key model.

Recent advanced methods leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and contrastive learning to characterize the spatial structure of road segments in a self-supervised paradigm.

To address these issues, we propose a $\\textbf{D}$ual-branch $\\textbf{S}$patial-$\\textbf{T}$emporal self-supervised representation framework for enhanced road representations, termed as DST.

Besides, DST contrasts road representations of the vanilla road network against that of the hypergraph in a spatial self-supervised way. The hypergraph is newly built based on three types of hyperedges to capture long-range relations. On the other hand, DST performs next token prediction as the temporal self-supervised task on the sequences of traffic dynamics based on a causal Transformer, which is further regularized by differentiating traffic modes of weekdays from those of weekends.

Yet, this task remains highly challenging due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of data across different buildings, climate zones, and seasonal patterns. In particular, buildings situated in distinct climatic regions introduce variability that often leads existing methods to overfit to spurious correlations, rely heavily on expert intervention, or compromise on data diversity. To address these limitations, we propose CaberNet, a causal and interpretable deep sequence model that learns invariant (Markov blanket) representations for robust cross-domain prediction. In a purely data-driven fashion and without requiring any prior knowledge, CaberNet integrates i) a global feature gate trained with a self-supervised Bernoulli regularization to distinguish superior causal features from inferior ones, and ii) a domain-wise training scheme that balances domain contributions, minimizes cross-domain loss variance, and promotes latent factor independence. We evaluate CaberNet on real-world datasets collected from three buildings located in three climatically diverse cities, and it consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving a 22.9\\% reduction in normalized mean squared error (NMSE) compared to the best benchmark.

The subtle distinguishing patterns, handling new species and the inherent open-set nature make the problem even harder. To address these complexities, foundation models trained on labeled, large-scale and multi-species animal Re-ID datasets have recently been introduced to enable zero-shot Re-ID. However, our benchmarking reveals significant gaps in their zero-shot Re-ID performance for both known and unknown species. While this highlights the need for collecting labeled data in new domains, exhaustive annotation for Re-ID is laborious and requires domain expertise. Our analyses show that existing unsupervised (USL) and AL Re-ID methods underperform for animal Re-ID. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel AL Re-ID framework that leverages complementary clustering methods to uncover and target structurally ambiguous regions in the embedding space for mining pairs of samples that are both informative and broadly representative. Oracle feedback on these pairs, in the form of must-link and cannot-link constraints, facilitates a simple annotation interface, which naturally integrates with existing USL methods through our proposed constrained clustering refinement algorithm.

While transfer learning has been extensively studied in traditional classification, transfer learning in imbalanced classification such as Neyman-Pearson classification has received much less attention. This setting poses unique challenges, as both types of errors must be simultaneously controlled. Existing works address only the case of distribution shift in $\u03bc_1$, whereas in many practical scenarios shifts may occur in both $\u03bc_0$ and $\u03bc_1$. We derive an adaptive procedure that not only guarantees improved Type-I and Type-II errors when the source is informative, but also automatically adapt to situations where the source is uninformative, thereby avoiding negative transfer.

To facilitate this task, we first present the Multimodal Multi-disease Medical Diagnosis Segmentation (M3DS) dataset, containing diverse multimodal multi-disease medical images paired with their corresponding segmentation masks and diagnosis chain-of-thought, created via an automated diagnosis chain-of-thought generation pipeline. Moreover, we propose Sim4Seg, a novel framework that improves the performance of diagnosis segmentation by taking advantage of the Region-Aware Vision-Language Similarity to Mask (RVLS2M) module.

Although churn prediction and demand forecasting have been widely studied in B2B contexts, the use of machine learning to guide asset allocation remains relatively unexplored. This paper presents a framework focused on predicting which beverage clients are most likely to deliver strong returns in volume after receiving a cooler. Using a private dataset from a well-known Central American brewing and beverage company of 3,119 B2B traditional trade channel clients that received a cooler from 2022-01 to 2024-07, and tracking 12 months of sales transactions before and after cooler installation, three growth thresholds were defined: 10%, 30% and 50% growth in sales volume year over year. The analysis compares results of machine learning models such as XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost combined with SHAP for interpretable feature analysis in order to have insights into improving business operations related to cooler allocation; the results show that the best model has AUC scores of 0.857, 0.877, and 0.898 across the thresholds on the validation set. Simulations suggest that this approach can improve ROI because it better selects potential clients to grow at the expected level and increases cost savings by not assigning clients that will not grow, compared to traditional volume-based approaches with substantial business management recommendations", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u54ea\u4e9b\u996e\u6599\u5ba2\u6237\u5728\u83b7\u5f97\u51b7\u85cf\u8bbe\u5907\u540e\u6700\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9500\u91cf\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f18\u5316\u8d44\u4ea7\u5206\u914d\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u6d88\u8d39\u54c1\u884c\u4e1a\uff0c\u5546\u4e1a\u51b7\u85cf\u8bbe\u5907\u7b49\u7269\u7406\u8d44\u4ea7\u7684\u653e\u7f6e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u6536\u5165\u589e\u957f\u548c\u6267\u884c\u6548\u7387\u3002\u867d\u7136B2B\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u6d41\u5931\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\u5df2\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6307\u5bfc\u8d44\u4ea7\u5206\u914d\u4ecd\u76f8\u5bf9\u672a\u88ab\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6765\u81ea\u4e2d\u7f8e\u6d32\u77e5\u540d\u917f\u9152\u548c\u996e\u6599\u516c\u53f8\u76843,119\u4e2aB2B\u4f20\u7edf\u8d38\u6613\u6e20\u9053\u5ba2\u6237\u7684\u79c1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u51b7\u85cf\u8bbe\u5907\u5b89\u88c5\u524d\u540e12\u4e2a\u6708\u7684\u9500\u552e\u4ea4\u6613\u3002\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e8610%\u300130%\u548c50%\u4e09\u4e2a\u9500\u91cf\u540c\u6bd4\u589e\u957f\u9608\u503c\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86XGBoost\u3001LightGBM\u548cCatBoost\u7b49\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408SHAP\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684AUC\u5f97\u5206\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.857\u30010.877\u548c0.898\u3002\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u9500\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u9009\u62e9\u6709\u589e\u957f\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\uff0c\u5e76\u907f\u514d\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u4e0d\u4f1a\u589e\u957f\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6295\u8d44\u56de\u62a5\u7387\u548c\u8282\u7701\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u6700\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u4ece\u51b7\u85cf\u8bbe\u5907\u5206\u914d\u4e2d\u53d7\u76ca\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e1a\u52a1\u8fd0\u8425\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8d44\u4ea7\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

We introduce, to our knowledge, the first system that conditions KG relation scoring on patient-level EHR context and distills that reasoning into an EHR-only model for zero-shot inference. A fusion \"Teacher\" learns mechanism-specific relations for drug pairs represented in both sources, while a distilled \"Student\" generalizes to new or rarely used drugs without KG access at inference. Both operate under a shared ontology (set) of pharmacologic mechanisms (drug relations) to produce interpretable, auditable alerts rather than opaque risk scores. Trained on a multi-institution EHR corpus paired with a curated DrugBank DDI graph, and evaluated using a clinically aligned, decision-focused protocol with leakage-safe negatives that avoid artificially easy pairs, the system maintains precision across multi-institutuion test data, produces mechanism-specific, clinically consistent predictions, reduces false alerts (higher precision) at comparable overall detection performance (F1), and misses fewer true interactions compared to prior methods.

Recent work has explored the use of vision-language models (VLMs) to automate concept selection and annotation. However, existing VLM-based CBMs typically require full model retraining when new concepts are involved, which limits their adaptability and flexibility in real-world scenarios, especially considering the rapid evolution of vision-language foundation models. To address these issues, we propose Flexible Concept Bottleneck Model (FCBM), which supports dynamic concept adaptation, including complete replacement of the original concept set. Specifically, we design a hypernetwork that generates prediction weights based on concept embeddings, allowing seamless integration of new concepts without retraining the entire model. In addition, we introduce a modified sparsemax module with a learnable temperature parameter that dynamically selects the most relevant concepts, enabling the model to focus on the most informative features. Extensive experiments on five public benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art baselines with a similar number of effective concepts.

While cognitive tests and clinical data are routinely collected, they lack the predictive power of PET scans and CSF biomarker analysis, which are prohibitively expensive to obtain for every patient. To address this cost-accuracy dilemma, we design a two-stage machine learning framework that selectively obtains advanced, costly features based on their predicted \"value of information\". We apply our framework to predict AD progression for MCI patients using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework reduces the need for advanced testing by 20% while achieving a test AUROC of 0.929, comparable to the model that uses both basic and advanced features (AUROC=0.915, p=0.1010). We also provide an example interpretability analysis showing how one may explain the triage decision. Our work presents an interpretable, data-driven framework that optimizes AD diagnostic pathways and balances accuracy with cost, representing a step towards making early, reliable AD prediction more accessible in real-world practice.

However, existing methods typically suffer from at least one of the following limitations, hindering their practical deployment: (1) lack of visual realism in generated anomalies; (2) dependence on large amounts of real images; and (3) use of memory-intensive, heavyweight model architectures. To overcome these limitations, we propose AnoStyler, a lightweight yet effective method that frames zero-shot anomaly generation as text-guided style transfer. Given a single normal image along with its category label and expected defect type, an anomaly mask indicating the localized anomaly regions and two-class text prompts representing the normal and anomaly states are generated using generalizable category-agnostic procedures. A lightweight U-Net model trained with CLIP-based loss functions is used to stylize the normal image into a visually realistic anomaly image, where anomalies are localized by the anomaly mask and semantically aligned with the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets show that AnoStyler outperforms existing anomaly generation methods in generating high-quality and diverse anomaly images.

However, recent studies have shown that MML can underperform, even compared to single-modality approaches, due to imbalanced learning across modalities. Methods have been proposed to alleviate this imbalance issue using different heuristics, which often lead to computationally intensive subroutines. In this paper, we reformulate the MML problem as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem that overcomes the imbalanced learning issue among modalities and propose a gradient-based algorithm to solve the modified MML problem. We provide convergence guarantees for the proposed method, and empirical evaluations on popular MML benchmarks showcasing the improved performance of the proposed method over existing balanced MML and MOO baselines, with up to ~20x reduction in subroutine computation time.

Although this decoupling strategy simplifies the learning process, it inherently ignores the geometric collaborative constraints between different attributes, resulting in the lack of geometric consistency prior, thereby leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we propose novel Spatial-Projection Alignment (SPAN) with two pivotal components: (i). Spatial Point Alignment enforces an explicit global spatial constraint between the predicted and ground-truth 3D bounding boxes, thereby rectifying spatial drift caused by decoupled attribute regression. (ii). 3D-2D Projection Alignment ensures that the projected 3D box is aligned tightly within its corresponding 2D detection bounding box on the image plane, mitigating projection misalignment overlooked in previous works. To ensure training stability, we further introduce a Hierarchical Task Learning strategy that progressively incorporates spatial-projection alignment as 3D attribute predictions refine, preventing early stage error propagation across attributes.

We introduce CLaP (Causal Layerwise Peeling), a framework that separates causal signal from context in a layerwise manner and integrates diverse graph representations of molecules. At each layer, a causal block performs a soft split into causal and non-causal branches, fuses causal evidence across modalities, and progressively removes batch-coupled context to focus on label-relevant structure, thereby limiting shortcut signals and stabilizing layerwise refinement. Across four molecular benchmarks, CLaP consistently improves MAE, MSE, and $R^2$ over competitive baselines. The model also produces atom-level causal saliency maps that highlight substructures responsible for predictions, providing actionable guidance for targeted molecular edits.

We present ML-EcoLyzer, a cross-framework tool for measuring the carbon, energy, thermal, and water costs of inference across CPUs, consumer GPUs, and datacenter accelerators. The tool supports both classical and modern models, applying adaptive monitoring and hardware-aware evaluation.\n  We introduce the Environmental Sustainability Score (ESS), which quantifies the number of effective parameters served per gram of CO$_2$ emitted.

ELoRA, recently proposed, is the first equivariant PEFT method. It achieves improved parameter efficiency and performance on many benchmarks. However, the relatively high degrees of freedom it retains within each tensor order can still perturb pretrained feature distributions and ultimately degrade performance. To address this, we present Magnitude-Modulated Equivariant Adapter (MMEA), a novel equivariant fine-tuning method which employs lightweight scalar gating to modulate feature magnitudes on a per-order and per-multiplicity basis. We demonstrate that MMEA preserves strict equivariance and, across multiple benchmarks, consistently improves energy and force predictions to state-of-the-art levels while training fewer parameters than competing approaches.

In this paper, we propose a novel Mixed RWKV-Transformer (MRT) architecture that encodes images into more compact 1-D latent representations by synergistically integrating the complementary strengths of linear-attention-based RWKV and self-attention-based Transformer models. Specifically, MRT partitions each image into fixed-size windows, utilizing RWKV modules to capture global dependencies across windows and Transformer blocks to model local redundancies within each window. The hierarchical attention mechanism enables more efficient and compact representation learning in the 1-D domain. To further enhance compression efficiency, we introduce a dedicated RWKV Compression Model (RCM) tailored to the structure characteristics of the intermediate 1-D latent features in MRT. Extensive experiments on standard image compression benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach. The proposed MRT framework consistently achieves superior reconstruction quality at bitrates below 0.02 bits per pixel (bpp).

SCARE comprises three core components: (1) Sequence Lens Projector (SLP) that logarithmically compresses time-series data while preserving boundary information across bins, (2) Efficient Bitwise Attention (EBA) module that replaces costly multiplications with bitwise operations via binary hash codes, and (3) Hash optimization strategy that ensures stable training without auxiliary loss terms. Together, these components minimize computational overhead while maintaining high accuracy and compatibility with microcontroller units (MCUs). Extensive experiments on large-scale air-quality datasets and real microcontroller deployments demonstrate that Scare outperforms existing linear, hybrid, and deep-learning baselines, making Scare, to the best of our knowledge, the first model to meet all eight microscopic requirements simultaneously.", "AI": {"tldr": "SCARE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8d85\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6821\u51c6Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db38\u4e2a\u5fae\u89c2\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6821\u51c6\u7814\u7a76\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b8f\u89c2\u9700\u6c42\uff08\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u77ac\u65f6\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7b49\u90e8\u7f72\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u9700\u6c42\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "SCARE\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1\uff09\u5e8f\u5217\u900f\u955c\u6295\u5f71\u5668\uff08SLP\uff09\u5bf9\u6570\u538b\u7f29\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u8fb9\u754c\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b2\uff09\u9ad8\u6548\u4f4d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08EBA\uff09\u6a21\u5757\u7528\u4f4d\u8fd0\u7b97\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e58\u6cd5\uff1b3\uff09\u54c8\u5e0c\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u786e\u4fdd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7a7a\u6c14\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u5fae\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u90e8\u7f72\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSCARE\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u6240\u67098\u4e2a\u5fae\u89c2\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "SCARE\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6821\u51c6\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u5fae\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4e0a\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u5907\u7aefAI\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Despite extensive research on OOD detection in 2D images, direct transfer to 3D LiDAR point clouds has been proven ineffective. Current LiDAR OOD methods struggle to distinguish rare anomalies from common classes, leading to high false-positive rates and overconfident errors in safety-critical settings. We propose Relative Energy Learning (REL), a simple yet effective framework for OOD detection in LiDAR point clouds. REL leverages the energy gap between positive (in-distribution) and negative logits as a relative scoring function, mitigating calibration issues in raw energy values and improving robustness across various scenes. To address the absence of OOD samples during training, we propose a lightweight data synthesis strategy called Point Raise, which perturbs existing point clouds to generate auxiliary anomalies without altering the inlier semantics. Evaluated on SemanticKITTI and the Spotting the Unexpected (STU) benchmark, REL consistently outperforms existing methods by a large margin. Our results highlight that modeling relative energy, combined with simple synthetic outliers, provides a principled and scalable solution for reliable OOD detection in open-world autonomous driving.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faREL\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8eLiDAR\u70b9\u4e91\u7684OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u5bf9\u80fd\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u548cPoint Raise\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728SemanticKITTI\u548cSTU\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u9760\u7684OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u8d85\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u969c\u788d\u7269\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709LiDAR OOD\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u7f55\u89c1\u5f02\u5e38\u548c\u5e38\u89c1\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "REL\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u6b63\u8d1flogit\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u5dee\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Point Raise\u7b56\u7565\u901a\u8fc7\u6270\u52a8\u70b9\u4e91\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728SemanticKITTI\u548cSTU\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cREL\u5927\u5e45\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u76f8\u5bf9\u80fd\u91cf\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u7b80\u5355\u5408\u6210\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f8\u5bf9\u80fd\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\u5408\u6210\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u4e3a\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u53ef\u9760OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing methods struggle with stylized avatars due to the lack of diverse multi-style datasets and challenges in maintaining geometric consistency in non-standard textures. To address these limitations, AvatarTex introduces a novel three-stage diffusion-to-GAN pipeline. Our key insight is that while diffusion models excel at generating diversified textures, they lack explicit UV constraints, whereas GANs provide a well-structured latent space that ensures style and topology consistency. By integrating these strengths, AvatarTex achieves high-quality topology-aligned texture synthesis with both artistic and geometric coherence. Specifically, our three-stage pipeline first completes missing texture regions via diffusion-based inpainting, refines style and structure consistency using GAN-based latent optimization, and enhances fine details through diffusion-based repainting.

In this work, we propose a pre-trained model-based framework for multi-modal continual learning.

Specifically, we use a rank-1 LoRA to create a minimal parameter adapter for Qwen-2.5-32B-Instruct which recovers 73-90% of reasoning-benchmark performance compared to a full parameter finetune. We find that the activations of this LoRA are as interpretable as MLP neurons, and fire for reasoning-specific behaviors. Finally, we train a sparse autoencoder on the entire activation state of this LoRA and identify fine-grained and monosemantic features.

Most of these are diffusion models with unique computational characteristics, distinct from both traditional small-scale ML models and large language models.

This creates significant challenges in designing a high-throughput system. We discovered that a large fraction of prompts can be served using faster, approximated models. However, the approximation setting must be carefully calibrated for each prompt to avoid quality degradation. Designing a high-throughput system that assigns each prompt to the appropriate model and compatible approximation setting remains a challenging problem. We present Argus, a high-throughput T2I inference system that selects the right level of approximation for each prompt to maintain quality while meeting throughput targets on a fixed-size cluster. Argus intelligently switches between different approximation strategies to satisfy both throughput and quality requirements.

While existing solutions, such as residual connections and skip layers, alleviate this issue to some extent, they fail to explicitly model how node representations evolve in a node-specific and progressive manner across layers. Moreover, these methods do not take global information into account, which is also crucial for mitigating the over-smoothing problem. To address the aforementioned issues, in this work, we propose a Dual Mamba-enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (DMbaGCN), which is a novel framework that integrates Mamba into GNNs to address over-smoothing from both local and global perspectives. DMbaGCN consists of two modules: the Local State-Evolution Mamba (LSEMba) for local neighborhood aggregation and utilizing Mamba's selective state space modeling to capture node-specific representation dynamics across layers, and the Global Context-Aware Mamba (GCAMba) that leverages Mamba's global attention capabilities to incorporate global context for each node. By combining these components, DMbaGCN enhances node discriminability in deep GNNs, thereby mitigating over-smoothing. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDMbaGCN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210Mamba\u5230GNN\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u89d2\u5ea6\u89e3\u51b3\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u8df3\u8dc3\u5c42\u672a\u80fd\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u8282\u70b9\u8868\u793a\u5728\u5c42\u95f4\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5b9a\u6e10\u8fdb\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u8003\u8651\u5168\u5c40\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u7f13\u89e3\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "method": "DMbaGCN\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff1aLSEMba\u7528\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u90bb\u57df\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u5229\u7528Mamba\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u6355\u83b7\u5c42\u95f4\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5b9a\u8868\u793a\u52a8\u6001\uff1bGCAMba\u5229\u7528Mamba\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u80fd\u529b\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u878d\u5165\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0cDMbaGCN\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6GNN\u4e2d\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u95ee\u9898"}}

Existing datasets often overlook two critical characteristics of real rainy 3D scenes: the viewpoint-dependent variation in the appearance of rain streaks caused by their projection onto 2D images, and the reduction in ambient brightness resulting from cloud coverage during rainfall. To improve data realism, we construct a new dataset named OmniRain3D that incorporates perspective heterogeneity and brightness dynamicity, enabling more faithful simulation of rain degradation in 3D scenes. Based on this dataset, we propose an end-to-end reconstruction framework named REVR-GSNet (Rain Elimination and Visibility Recovery for 3D Gaussian Splatting). Specifically, REVR-GSNet integrates recursive brightness enhancement, Gaussian primitive optimization, and GS-guided rain elimination into a unified architecture through joint alternating optimization, achieving high-fidelity reconstruction of clean 3D scenes from rain-degraded inputs.

Consequently, leveraging private data within organizations to enhance the performance of large models has emerged as a key challenge. The federated learning paradigm, combined with model fine-tuning techniques, effectively reduces the number of trainable parameters. However,the necessity to process high-dimensional feature spaces results in substantial overall computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose the Implicit Federated In-Context Learning (IFed-ICL) framework. IFed-ICL draws inspiration from federated learning to establish a novel distributed collaborative paradigm, by converting client local context examples into implicit vector representations, it enables distributed collaborative computation during the inference phase and injects model residual streams to enhance model performance. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves outstanding performance across multiple text classification tasks. Compared to traditional methods, IFed-ICL avoids the extensive parameter updates required by conventional fine-tuning methods while reducing data transmission and local computation at the client level in federated learning. This enables efficient distributed context learning using local private-domain data, significantly improving model performance on specific tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86IFed-ICL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u672c\u5730\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u793a\u4f8b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u9690\u5f0f\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u534f\u4f5c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u672c\u5730\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5176\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u9762\u4e34\u67af\u7aed\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5185\u7684\u79c1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u867d\u7136\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ecd\u5e26\u6765\u5de8\u5927\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "IFed-ICL\u6846\u67b6\u501f\u9274\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u601d\u60f3\u5efa\u7acb\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u534f\u4f5c\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u672c\u5730\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u793a\u4f8b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u9690\u5f0f\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u534f\u4f5c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u6ce8\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u6b8b\u5dee\u6d41\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u672c\u5730\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "IFed-ICL\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u672c\u5730\u79c1\u6709\u57df\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u79c1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u5229\u7528\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Moreover, QUARK lowers the hardware overhead of nonlinear modules by more than 50% compared to prior approaches, all while maintaining high model accuracy -- and even substantially boosting accuracy under ultra-low-bit quantization.", "AI": {"tldr": "QUARK\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eFPGA\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u52a0\u901f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u8def\u5171\u4eab\u6280\u672f\u4f18\u5316Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u786c\u4ef6\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728CV\u548cNLP\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u64cd\u4f5c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u7ed9\u786c\u4ef6\u52a0\u901f\u5e26\u6765\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faQUARK\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5171\u540c\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7535\u8def\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\u9ad8\u6548\u52a0\u901fTransformer\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4GPU\u5b9e\u73b0\u83b7\u5f971.96\u500d\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u5757\u786c\u4ef6\u5f00\u9500\u964d\u4f4e50%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u5728\u8d85\u4f4e\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u8fd8\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "QUARK\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u7535\u8def\u5171\u4eab\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u52a0\u901f\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, without a global understanding of both subjects and background, recognizing actions in such samples remains challenging because of the background distractions. Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), which learns interaction between various dimensions, shows promise for global modeling. While directly applying RWKV to wide-angle FSAR may fail to highlight subjects due to excessive background information. Additionally, temporal relation degraded by frames with similar backgrounds is difficult to reconstruct, further impacting performance. Therefore, we design the CompOund SegmenTation and Temporal REconstructing RWKV (Otter). Specifically, the Compound Segmentation Module~(CSM) is devised to segment and emphasize key patches in each frame, effectively highlighting subjects against background information. The Temporal Reconstruction Module (TRM) is incorporated into the temporal-enhanced prototype construction to enable bidirectional scanning, allowing better reconstruct temporal relation. Furthermore, a regular prototype is combined with the temporal-enhanced prototype to simultaneously enhance subject emphasis and temporal modeling, improving wide-angle FSAR performance. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as SSv2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51 demonstrate that Otter achieves state-of-the-art performance.

We propose Data Trajectory Alignment (DTA), a two-phase, model-agnostic data curation framework that treats solution processes - not only final answers - as first-class supervision. Phase I (Initializing) synthesizes diverse, high-coverage candidates using an ensemble of strong teachers. Phase II (DTA) rewrites teacher solutions to align intermediate steps and presentation style with the target student's inductive biases and then performs signal-aware exemplar selection via agreement checks and reflection-based judging. Instantiated on telecommunications mathematics (e.g., link budgets, SNR/AMC selection, and power-control feasibility), DTA yields state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy on TELEMATH without enabling explicit \"thinking\" modes: 72.45% pass@1, surpassing distilled-only training by +17.65 points and outperforming a strong baseline (Qwen3-32B with thinking enabled) by +2.94 points. Token-shift analyses indicate that DTA concentrates gains on logical-structural discourse markers rather than merely amplifying domain nouns, indicating improved reasoning scaffolding. Under edge-like inference settings, DTA improves efficiency by reducing reliance on multi-sample voting and disabling expensive reasoning heuristics, cutting energy per output token by ~42% versus Qwen3-32B (thinking mode enabled) and end-to-end latency by ~60% versus Qwen3-32B (thinking mode disabled).

A common technique in VAE-based collaborative filtering (CF) consists in applying binary input masking to user interaction vectors, which improves performance but remains underexplored theoretically. In this work, we analyze how collaboration arises in VAE-based CF and show it is governed by latent proximity: we derive a latent sharing radius that informs when an SGD update on one user strictly reduces the loss on another user, with influence decaying as the latent Wasserstein distance increases. We further study the induced geometry: with clean inputs, VAE-based CF primarily exploits \\emph{local} collaboration between input-similar users and under-utilizes global collaboration between far-but-related users. We compare two mechanisms that encourage \\emph{global} mixing and characterize their trade-offs: (1) $\u03b2$-KL regularization directly tightens the information bottleneck, promoting posterior overlap but risking representational collapse if too large; (2) input masking induces stochastic geometric contractions and expansions, which can bring distant users onto the same latent neighborhood but also introduce neighborhood drift. To preserve user identity while enabling global consistency, we propose an anchor regularizer that aligns user posteriors with item embeddings, stabilizing users under masking and facilitating signal sharing across related items. Our analyses are validated on the Netflix, MovieLens-20M, and Million Song datasets. We also successfully deployed our proposed algorithm on an Amazon streaming platform following a successful online experiment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86VAE\u5728\u534f\u540c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4e2d\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027\u5bf9\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5168\u5c40\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u951a\u70b9\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u7528\u6237\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "VAE\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u8f93\u5165\u63a9\u7801\u6280\u672f\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3VAE\u5728\u534f\u540c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u5b9e\u73b0\u7528\u6237\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5c40\u90e8\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1. \u63a8\u5bfc\u6f5c\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u534a\u5f84\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u534f\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\uff1b2. \u6bd4\u8f83\u03b2-KL\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u63a9\u7801\u4e24\u79cd\u5168\u5c40\u6df7\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff1b3. \u63d0\u51fa\u951a\u70b9\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u6765\u5bf9\u9f50\u7528\u6237\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u7269\u54c1\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7528\u6237\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728Netflix\u3001MovieLens-20M\u548cMillion Song\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728Amazon\u6d41\u5a92\u4f53\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u6210\u529f\u90e8\u7f72\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "VAE\u534f\u540c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u534f\u4f5c\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5168\u5c40\u534f\u4f5c\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u63a9\u7801\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5168\u5c40\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u800c\u951a\u70b9\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u7528\u6237\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

Recently, the integration of flow matching generative models into image restoration has garnered significant attention, owing to their powerful prior modeling capabilities. In this work, we incorporate such generative priors into a Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework based on proximal splitting, where the proximal operator associated with the regularizer is replaced by a time-dependent denoiser derived from the generative model. While existing PnP methods have achieved notable success in inverse problems with smooth squared $\\ell_2$ data fidelity--typically associated with Gaussian noise--their applicability to more general data fidelity terms remains underexplored. To address this, we propose a general and efficient PnP algorithm inspired by the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method. Our approach is computationally efficient, memory-friendly, and accommodates a wide range of fidelity terms. In particular, it supports both $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ norm-based losses, enabling robustness to non-Gaussian noise types such as Poisson and impulse noise. We validate our method on several image restoration tasks, including denoising, super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting, and demonstrate that $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ fidelity terms outperform the conventional squared $\\ell_2$ loss in the presence of non-Gaussian noise.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb-\u5bf9\u5076\u6df7\u5408\u68af\u5ea6(PDHG)\u7684\u901a\u7528PnP\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u4e2d\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u2113\u2081\u548c\u2113\u2082\u8303\u6570\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5bf9\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709PnP\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u5e73\u65b9\u2113\u2082\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u771f\u9879\u5e94\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\uff08\u5982\u6cca\u677e\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u8109\u51b2\u566a\u58f0\uff09\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8ePDHG\u7684PnP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u66ff\u6362\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\u7684\u90bb\u8fd1\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u2113\u2081\u548c\u2113\u2082\u8303\u6570\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5185\u5b58\u53cb\u597d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u53bb\u566a\u3001\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u7b49\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u2113\u2081\u548c\u2113\u2082\u4fdd\u771f\u9879\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5e73\u65b9\u2113\u2082\u635f\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u901a\u7528PnP\u7b97\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u7c7b\u578b\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Most existing methods rely heavily on long and continuous EEG recordings, which poses significant challenges for data acquisition in resource-constrained systems, such as wearable or home-based monitoring systems. In this paper, we propose the task of resource-efficient sleep staging, which aims to reduce the amount of signal collected per sleep epoch while maintaining reliable classification performance. To solve this task, we adopt the masking and prompt learning strategy and propose a novel framework called Mask-Aware Sleep Staging (MASS). Specifically, we design a multi-level masking strategy to promote effective feature modeling under partial and irregular observations. To mitigate the loss of contextual information introduced by masking, we further propose a hierarchical prompt learning mechanism that aggregates unmasked data into a global prompt, serving as a semantic anchor for guiding both patch-level and epoch-level feature modeling.

However, existing medical multimodal models often rely on simple one-to-one hard labeling, oversimplifying clinical reality where symptoms relate to multiple organs. In addition, they mainly use single-slice 2D features without incorporating 3D information, limiting their ability to capture full anatomical context. In this study, we propose Med-SORA, a framework for symptom-to-organ reasoning in abdominal CT images.

Parameter sharing, a form of structured compression, effectively reduces redundancy, but existing approaches remain heuristic-restricted to adjacent layers and lacking a systematic analysis for cross-layer sharing. However, extending sharing across multiple layers leads to an exponentially expanding configuration space, making exhaustive search computationally infeasible and forming a critical bottleneck for parameter sharing. We recast parameter sharing from a group-theoretic perspective as introducing structural symmetries in the model's parameter space. A sharing configuration can be described by a coloring function $\u03b1:L\\rightarrow C$ (L: layer indices and C: sharing classes), which determines inter-layer sharing groups while preserving structural symmetry. To determine the coloring function, we propose a second-order geometric criterion based on Taylor expansion and the Hessian spectrum. By projecting perturbations onto the Hessian's low-curvature eigensubspace, the criterion provides an analytic rule for selecting sharing groups that minimize performance impact, yielding a principled and scalable configuration procedure.

The method aims to simplify color correction by adjusting the Hue (H), Saturation (S), and Value (V) components independently. This approach resolves the inherent color coupling problems in traditional methods. Our model adopts a two-stage architecture: First, a Chroma-Aware Spectral Tokenizer (CAST) converts the input image from RGB space to HSV space and independently encodes the Hue (H) and Value (V) channels into a set of semantic tokens describing the Purple flare status; second, the HSV-LUT module takes these tokens as input and dynamically generates independent correction curves (1D-LUTs) for the three channels H, S, and V. To effectively train and validate our model, we built the first large-scale purple flare dataset with diverse scenes.

To overcome these limitations, we propose to harmonizes knowledge and data through prior alignment and conflict resolution. First, we assess the credibility of imperfect structural constraints through a surrogate model, which then guides a sparse penalization term measuring the loss between the learned and constrained adjacency matrices. We theoretically prove that, under ideal assumption, the knowledge-driven objective aligns with the data-driven objective. Furthermore, to resolve conflicts when this assumption is violated, we introduce a multi-task learning framework optimized via multi-gradient descent, jointly minimizing both objectives.

Accepted by IROS 2025", "summary": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a key rendering pipeline for digital asset creation due to its balance between efficiency and visual quality. To address the issues of unstable pose estimation and scene representation distortion caused by geometric texture inconsistency in large outdoor scenes with weak or repetitive textures, we approach the problem from two aspects: pose estimation and scene representation. For pose estimation, we leverage LiDAR-IMU Odometry to provide prior poses for cameras in large-scale environments. These prior pose constraints are incorporated into COLMAP's triangulation process, with pose optimization performed via bundle adjustment. Ensuring consistency between pixel data association and prior poses helps maintain both robustness and accuracy. For scene representation, we introduce normal vector constraints and effective rank regularization to enforce consistency in the direction and shape of Gaussian primitives. These constraints are jointly optimized with the existing photometric loss to enhance the map quality. We evaluate our approach using both public and self-collected datasets. In terms of pose optimization, our method requires only one-third of the time while maintaining accuracy and robustness across both datasets.

This issue stems from cloning-based densification, which propagates Gaussians along existing geometry, limiting exploration and requiring many primitives to adequately cover the scene. We present ConeGS, an image-space-informed densification framework that is independent of existing scene geometry state. ConeGS first creates a fast Instant Neural Graphics Primitives (iNGP) reconstruction as a geometric proxy to estimate per-pixel depth. During the subsequent 3DGS optimization, it identifies high-error pixels and inserts new Gaussians along the corresponding viewing cones at the predicted depth values, initializing their size according to the cone diameter. A pre-activation opacity penalty rapidly removes redundant Gaussians, while a primitive budgeting strategy controls the total number of primitives, either by a fixed budget or by adapting to scene complexity, ensuring high reconstruction quality.

However, their broad knowledge capacity raises growing concerns about privacy leakage, toxicity mitigation, and intellectual property violations. Machine Unlearning (MU) offers a practical solution by selectively forgetting targeted knowledge while preserving overall model utility. When applied to MLLMs, existing neuron-editing-based MU approaches face two fundamental challenges: (1) forgetting becomes inconsistent across modalities because existing point-wise attribution methods fail to capture the structured, layer-by-layer information flow that connects different modalities; and (2) general knowledge performance declines when sensitive neurons that also support important reasoning paths are pruned, as this disrupts the model's ability to generalize. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a multimodal influential neuron path editor (MIP-Editor) for MU. Our approach introduces modality-specific attribution scores to identify influential neuron paths responsible for encoding forget-set knowledge and applies influential-path-aware neuron-editing via representation misdirection. This strategy also enables effective and coordinated forgetting across modalities while preserving the model's general capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that MIP-Editor achieves a superior unlearning performance on multimodal tasks, with a maximum forgetting rate of 87.75% and up to 54.26% improvement in general knowledge retention.

Yet, dense disparity supervision is nearly impossible due to anatomical constraints, typically limiting annotations to only a few image-level labels acquired before the endoscope enters deep body cavities. Teacher-Student Learning (TSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging a teacher trained on sparse labels to generate pseudo labels and associated confidence maps from abundant unlabeled surgical videos. However, existing TSL methods are confined to image-level supervision, providing only spatial confidence and lacking temporal consistency estimation. This absence of spatio-temporal reliability results in unstable disparity predictions and severe flickering artifacts across video frames. To overcome these challenges, we propose TiS-TSL, a novel time-switchable teacher-student learning framework for video stereo matching under minimal supervision. At its core is a unified model that operates in three distinct modes: Image-Prediction (IP), Forward Video-Prediction (FVP), and Backward Video-Prediction (BVP), enabling flexible temporal modeling within a single architecture. Enabled by this unified model, TiS-TSL adopts a two-stage learning strategy. The Image-to-Video (I2V) stage transfers sparse image-level knowledge to initialize temporal modeling. The subsequent Video-to-Video (V2V) stage refines temporal disparity predictions by comparing forward and backward predictions to calculate bidirectional spatio-temporal consistency. This consistency identifies unreliable regions across frames, filters noisy video-level pseudo labels, and enforces temporal coherence.

However, existing machine unlearning algorithms frequently neglect the fact that different data points may contribute unequally to model performance (i.e., heterogeneous data values). Treat them equally in machine unlearning procedure can potentially degrading the performance of updated models. To address this limitation, we propose Data Value-Weighted Unlearning (DVWU), a general unlearning framework that accounts for data value heterogeneity into the unlearning process. Specifically, we design a weighting strategy based on data values, which are then integrated into the unlearning procedure to enable differentiated unlearning for data points with varying utility to the model. The DVWU framework can be broadly adapted to various existing machine unlearning methods. We use the one-step Newton update as an example for implementation, developing both output and objective perturbation algorithms to achieve certified unlearning. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods achieve superior predictive performance and robustness compared to conventional unlearning approaches. We further show the extensibility of our framework on gradient ascent method by incorporating the proposed weighting strategy into the gradient terms, highlighting the adaptability of DVWU for broader gradient-based deep unlearning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u4ef7\u503c\u52a0\u6743\u9057\u5fd8\uff08DVWU\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8003\u8651\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6743\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u7b97\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u5dee\u5f02\uff08\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u6570\u636e\u4ef7\u503c\uff09\uff0c\u5e73\u7b49\u5904\u7406\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u66f4\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u6574\u5408\u5230\u9057\u5fd8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u9057\u5fd8\u3002\u4ee5\u4e00\u6b65\u725b\u987f\u66f4\u65b0\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u8f93\u51fa\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u6270\u52a8\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DVWU\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u5e94\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

Recently, denoisers induced by generative priors have been successfully integrated into regularized optimization methods for image restoration under Gaussian noise.

In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play image restoration framework based on generative diffusion priors for robust removal of general noise types, including impulse noise. Within the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation framework, the data fidelity term is adapted to the specific noise model. Departing from the conventional least-squares loss used for Gaussian noise, we introduce a generalized Gaussian scale mixture-based loss, which approximates a wide range of noise distributions and leads to an $\\ell_q$-norm ($0<q\\leq2$) fidelity term. This optimization problem is addressed using an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) approach, wherein the proximal step involving the generative prior is efficiently performed via a diffusion-based denoiser.

FedNET employs Federated Learning (FL) to model the temporal evolution of node-level traffic in a distributed manner, enabling accurate multi-step-ahead predictions (e.g., several hours to days) without exposing sensitive network data. Using these node-level forecasts and known routing information, FedNET estimates the future link-level utilization by aggregating traffic contributions across all source-destination pairs. The links are then ranked according to the predicted load intensity and temporal variability, providing an early warning signal for potential high-risk links. We compare the federated traffic prediction of FedNET against a centralized multi-step learning baseline and then systematically analyze the impact of history and prediction window sizes on forecast accuracy using the $R^2$ score. Results indicate that FL achieves accuracy close to centralized training, with shorter prediction horizons consistently yielding the highest accuracy ($R^2 >0.92$), while longer horizons providing meaningful forecasts ($R^2 \\approx 0.45\\text{--}0.55$). We further validate the efficacy of the FedNET framework in predicting network utilization on a realistic network topology and demonstrate that it consistently identifies high-risk links well in advance (i.e., three days ahead) of the critical stress states emerging, making it a practical tool for anticipatory traffic engineering and capacity planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedNET\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u901a\u4fe1\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u94fe\u8def\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u8bc6\u522b\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u591a\u6b65\u6d41\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u6765\u63d0\u524d\u8bc6\u522b\u6f5c\u5728\u9ad8\u8d1f\u8f7d\u94fe\u8def\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u6d41\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5171\u4eab\u654f\u611f\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u53c8\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u91cf\u3001\u63d0\u524d\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u94fe\u8def\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u8282\u70b9\u7ea7\u6d41\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5df2\u77e5\u8def\u7531\u4fe1\u606f\u805a\u5408\u6e90-\u76ee\u7684\u5730\u5bf9\u6d41\u91cf\u8d21\u732e\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u94fe\u8def\u7ea7\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u53d8\u7279\u6027\u5bf9\u94fe\u8def\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u63a5\u8fd1\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u77ed\u9884\u6d4b\u5468\u671f\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\uff08R\u00b2>0.92\uff09\uff0c\u957f\u5468\u671f\u4e5f\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff08R\u00b2\u22480.45-0.55\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u524d\u4e09\u5929\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u94fe\u8def\u3002", "conclusion": "FedNET\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u6d41\u91cf\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u5bb9\u91cf\u89c4\u5212\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u5173\u952e\u538b\u529b\u72b6\u6001\u51fa\u73b0\u524d\u63d0\u524d\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u94fe\u8def\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u3002"}}

As variants continue to appear, assessing the perceptual quality of 3D objects reconstructed with different GS-based methods remains an open challenge. To address this issue, we first propose a unified multi-distance subjective quality assessment method that closely mimics human viewing behavior for objects reconstructed with GS-based methods in actual applications, thereby better collecting perceptual experiences. Based on it, we also construct a novel GS quality assessment dataset named MUGSQA, which is constructed considering multiple uncertainties of the input data. These uncertainties include the quantity and resolution of input views, the view distance, and the accuracy of the initial point cloud. Moreover, we construct two benchmarks: one to evaluate the robustness of various GS-based reconstruction methods under multiple uncertainties, and the other to evaluate the performance of existing quality assessment metrics.

Unlike standard transformer architectures that operate in a purely feedforward manner during inference, FH-RL enables internal recurrence without external looping, allowing prior latent states to be dynamically re-entered into the ongoing computation stream. We conduct controlled experiments sweeping the reentry gain $\u03b3$ and evaluate emergent internal dynamics using three novel metrics: the Information Reentry Ratio (IRR), Eigen-Spectrum Recursion Index (ESRI), and Representational Drift Periodicity (RDP). Results show that reentry quantity increases proportionally with~$\u03b3$, while the learned feedback matrix $W_r$ remains bounded and becomes more structured at moderate gains. Critically, a stable reflective band emerges around $\u03b3\\approx 0.10-0.20$, where internal feedback is maximally expressive yet spectrally stable: IRR rises smoothly, ESRI remains near zero, and RDP exhibits consistent low-frequency cycles. These findings provide quantitative evidence that reflective, thought-like internal processing can arise from a principled balance between feedback amplification and homeostatic regulation, linking modern fast-weight architectures to theories of cortical reentry and recursive cognition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FH-RL\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5feb\u901f\u6743\u91cd\u5173\u8054\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3001\u7a33\u6001\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u91cd\u5165\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u6307\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u589e\u76ca\u03b3\u22480.10-0.20\u65f6\u5f62\u6210\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u53cd\u5c04\u5e26\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u5185\u90e8\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6transformer\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4ec5\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u9012\u5f52\uff0c\u8ba9\u5148\u524d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u5165\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d41\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1FH-RL\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5feb\u901f\u6743\u91cd\u5173\u8054\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3001\u7a33\u6001\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u91cd\u5165\u53cd\u9988\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u626b\u63cf\u91cd\u5165\u589e\u76ca\u03b3\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528IRR\u3001ESRI\u548cRDP\u4e09\u4e2a\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u5185\u90e8\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u91cd\u5165\u91cf\u968f\u03b3\u6bd4\u4f8b\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u53cd\u9988\u77e9\u9635Wr\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u754c\u4e14\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u589e\u76ca\u4e0b\u66f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3002\u5728\u03b3\u22480.10-0.20\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u53cd\u5c04\u5e26\uff0c\u5185\u90e8\u53cd\u9988\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u6700\u5f3a\u4e14\u9891\u8c31\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cd\u9988\u653e\u5927\u548c\u7a33\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ea7\u751f\u7c7b\u4f3c\u601d\u7ef4\u7684\u53cd\u5c04\u6027\u5185\u90e8\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5c06\u73b0\u4ee3\u5feb\u901f\u6743\u91cd\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u76ae\u5c42\u91cd\u5165\u548c\u9012\u5f52\u8ba4\u77e5\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u3002"}}

However, current methods still suffer from flickering, identity drift, and poor audio-visual synchronization. These issues primarily stem from entangled appearance-motion representations and unstable inference strategies. In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{ConsistTalk}, a novel intensity-controllable and temporally consistent talking head generation framework with diffusion noise search inference. First, we propose \\textbf{an optical flow-guided temporal module (OFT)} that decouples motion features from static appearance by leveraging facial optical flow, thereby reducing visual flicker and improving temporal consistency. Second, we present an \\textbf{Audio-to-Intensity (A2I) model} obtained through multimodal teacher-student knowledge distillation. By transforming audio and facial velocity features into a frame-wise intensity sequence, the A2I model enables joint modeling of audio and visual motion, resulting in more natural dynamics. This further enables fine-grained, frame-wise control of motion dynamics while maintaining tight audio-visual synchronization.

First, a physics informed conditional neural field is trained to approximate the nonlinear parametric solutionof the governing equations. This establishes a continuous mapping between the parameter and solution spaces, which can then be evaluated for a given parameter at any spatial resolution. Second, since the neural approximation may not be exact, it is subsequently refined using a Newton-based correction initialized by the neural output. To evaluate the effectiveness of this hybrid approach, we compare three solution strategies: (i) the standard Newton-Raphson solver used in NFEM, which is robust and accurate but computationally demanding; (ii) physics-informed neural operators, which provide rapid inference but may lose accuracy outside the training distribution and resolution; and (iii) the neural-initialized Newton (NiN) strategy, which combines the efficiency of neural operators with the robustness of NFEM.

Current approaches, however, remain constrained by the scarcity of high-quality stimulus-brain response pairs and the inherent semantic mismatch between neural representations and visual content. Inspired by perceptual variability and co-adaptive strategy of the biological systems, we propose a novel self-supervised architecture, named NeuroBridge, which integrates Cognitive Prior Augmentation (CPA) with Shared Semantic Projector (SSP) to promote effective cross-modality alignment. Specifically, CPA simulates perceptual variability by applying asymmetric, modality-specific transformations to both EEG signals and images, enhancing semantic diversity. Unlike previous approaches, SSP establishes a bidirectional alignment process through a co-adaptive strategy, which mutually aligns features from two modalities into a shared semantic space for effective cross-modal learning. NeuroBridge surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods under both intra-subject and inter-subject settings. In the intra-subject scenario, it achieves the improvements of 12.3% in top-1 accuracy and 10.2% in top-5 accuracy, reaching 63.2% and 89.9% respectively on a 200-way zero-shot retrieval task.

However, due to the accumulation of model errors over long-horizon rollouts, such methods often face challenges in maintaining modeling stability. To address this, we propose CtrlFlow, a trajectory-level synthetic method using conditional flow matching (CFM), which directly modeling the distribution of trajectories from initial states to high-return terminal states without explicitly modeling the environment transition function. Our method ensures optimal trajectory sampling by minimizing the control energy governed by the non-linear Controllability Gramian Matrix, while the generated diverse trajectory data significantly enhances the robustness and cross-task generalization of policy learning.

One of the main challenges is to stitch together multiple images into a single high-resolution image that covers a large area. Featurebased image stitching algorithms are commonly used but can suffer from errors and ambiguities in feature detection and matching. To address this, several approaches have been proposed, including using bundle adjustment techniques or direct image alignment. In this paper, we present a novel method that uses a combination of IMU data and computer vision techniques for stitching images captured by a UAV. Our method involves several steps such as estimating the displacement and rotation of the UAV between consecutive images, correcting for perspective distortion, and computing a homography matrix. We then use a standard image stitching algorithm to align and blend the images together. Our proposed method leverages the additional information provided by the IMU data, corrects for various sources of distortion, and can be easily integrated into existing UAV workflows.

First, M2M-DC ranks residual (or inverted-residual) blocks by a label-aware mutual information (MI) signal and removes the least informative units (structured prune-after-training). It then alternates short KD phases with stage-coherent, residual-safe channel slicing: (i) stage \"planes\" (co-slicing conv2 out-channels with the downsample path and next-stage inputs), and (ii) an optional mid-channel trim (conv1 out / bn1 / conv2 in). This targets complementary redundancy, whole computational motifs and within-stage width while preserving residual shape invariants. On CIFAR-100, M2M-DC yields a clean accuracy-compute frontier. For ResNet-18, we obtain 85.46% Top-1 with 3.09M parameters and 0.0139 GMacs (72% params, 63% GMacs vs. teacher; mean final 85.29% over three seeds). For ResNet-34, we reach 85.02% Top-1 with 5.46M params and 0.0195 GMacs (74% / 74% vs. teacher; mean final 84.62%). Extending to inverted-residuals, MobileNetV2 achieves a mean final 68.54% Top-1 at 1.71M params (27%) and 0.0186 conv GMacs (24%), improving over the teacher's 66.03% by +2.5 points across three seeds. Because M2M-DC exposes only a thin, architecture-aware interface (blocks, stages, and down sample/skip wiring), it generalizes across residual CNNs and extends to inverted-residual families with minor legalization rules.

We provide the first comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon through a novel analytical framework termed as ``distillation dynamics\", combining frequency spectrum analysis, information entropy metrics, and activation magnitude tracking. Our investigation reveals that ViTs exhibit a distinctive U-shaped information processing pattern: initial compression followed by expansion. We identify the root cause of negative transfer in feature distillation: a fundamental representational paradigm mismatch between teacher and student models. Through frequency-domain analysis, we show that teacher models employ distributed, high-dimensional encoding strategies in later layers that smaller student models cannot replicate due to limited channel capacity. This mismatch causes late-layer feature alignment to actively harm student performance. Our findings reveal that successful knowledge transfer in ViTs requires moving beyond naive feature mimicry to methods that respect these fundamental representational constraints, providing essential theoretical guidance for designing effective ViTs compression strategies.

Existing approaches for ISTS modeling primarily rely on observed values to impute unobserved ones or infer latent dynamics. However, these methods overlook a critical source of learning signal: the reconstruction error inherently produced during model training. Such error implicitly reflects how well a model captures the underlying data structure and can serve as an informative proxy for unobserved values. To exploit this insight, we propose iTimER, a simple yet effective self-supervised pre-training framework for ISTS representation learning. iTimER models the distribution of reconstruction errors over observed values and generates pseudo-observations for unobserved timestamps through a mixup strategy between sampled errors and the last available observations.

While truncated diffusion probabilistic models (TDPMs) hold strong potential with a paradigm optimization, existing TDPMs suffer from entangled accuracy and diversity of predictions with insufficient fidelity and plausibility. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose Ambiguity-aware Truncated Flow Matching (ATFM), which introduces a novel inference paradigm and dedicated model components. Firstly, we propose Data-Hierarchical Inference, a redefinition of AMIS-specific inference paradigm, which enhances accuracy and diversity at data-distribution and data-sample level, respectively, for an effective disentanglement. Secondly, Gaussian Truncation Representation (GTR) is introduced to enhance both fidelity of predictions and reliability of truncation distribution, by explicitly modeling it as a Gaussian distribution at $T_{\\text{trunc}}$ instead of using sampling-based approximations.Thirdly, Segmentation Flow Matching (SFM) is proposed to enhance the plausibility of diverse predictions by extending semantic-aware flow transformation in Flow Matching (FM). Comprehensive evaluations on LIDC and ISIC3 datasets demonstrate that ATFM outperforms SOTA methods and simultaneously achieves a more efficient inference.

To overcome this, we introduce the non-conservative generalized Schr\u00f6dinger bridge (NCGSB), a novel, energy-varying reformulation based on contact Hamiltonian mechanics. By allowing energy to change over time, the NCGSB provides a broader class of real-world stochastic processes, capturing richer and more faithful intermediate dynamics. By parameterizing the Wasserstein manifold, we lift the bridge problem to a tractable geodesic computation in a finite-dimensional space. Unlike computationally expensive iterative solutions, our contact Wasserstein geodesic (CWG) is naturally implemented via a ResNet architecture and relies on a non-iterative solver with near-linear complexity. Furthermore, CWG supports guided generation by modulating a task-specific distance metric.

However, VQ-based frameworks suffer from several issues, such as non-smooth latent spaces, weak alignment between representations before and after quantization, and poor coherence between the continuous and discrete domains. These issues lead to unstable codeword learning and underutilized codebooks, ultimately degrading the performance of both reconstruction and downstream generation tasks. To this end, we propose VAEVQ, which comprises three key components: (1) Variational Latent Quantization (VLQ), replacing the AE with a VAE for quantization to leverage its structured and smooth latent space, thereby facilitating more effective codeword activation; (2) Representation Coherence Strategy (RCS), adaptively modulating the alignment strength between pre- and post-quantization features to enhance consistency and prevent overfitting to noise; and (3) Distribution Consistency Regularization (DCR), aligning the entire codebook distribution with the continuous latent distribution to improve utilization. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that VAEVQ outperforms state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "VAEVQ\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5206\u6f5c\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u8868\u793a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u91cf\u5316\u524d\u540e\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u91cf\u5316\u524d\u540e\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u4e0e\u79bb\u6563\u57df\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7801\u5b57\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u7801\u672c\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "1) \u53d8\u5206\u6f5c\u5728\u91cf\u5316(VLQ)\uff1a\u7528VAE\u66ff\u4ee3AE\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5e73\u6ed1\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b2) \u8868\u793a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7b56\u7565(RCS)\uff1a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u8282\u91cf\u5316\u524d\u540e\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff1b3) \u5206\u5e03\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316(DCR)\uff1a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7801\u672c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cVAEVQ\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "VAEVQ\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7801\u672c\u5229\u7528\u7387\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) presents a promising solution, achieving performance comparable to full fine-tuning by updating only a small number of adaptation weights per layer. Traditional PEFT methods typically rely on a single expert, where the adaptation weight is a low-rank matrix. However, for complex tasks, the data's inherent diversity poses a significant challenge for such models, as a single adaptation weight cannot adequately capture the features of all samples. To address this limitation, we explore how to integrate multiple small adaptation experts into a compact structure to defeat a large adapter. Specifically, we propose Tucker Adaptation (TuckA), a method with four key properties: (i) We use Tucker decomposition to create a compact 3D tensor where each slice naturally serves as an expert. The low-rank nature of this decomposition ensures that the number of parameters scales efficiently as more experts are added. (ii) We introduce a hierarchical strategy that organizes these experts into groups at different granularities, allowing the model to capture both local and global data patterns. (iii) We develop an efficient batch-level routing mechanism, which reduces the router's parameter size by a factor of $L$ compared to routing at every adapted layer (where $L$ is the number of adapted layers) (iv) We propose data-aware initialization to achieve loss-free expert load balancing based on theoretical analysis.

Yet, most models are trained to map short prompts into detailed images, creating a gap between sparse textual input and rich visual outputs. This mismatch reduces controllability, as models often fill in missing details arbitrarily, biasing toward average user preferences and limiting precision for professional use. We address this limitation by training the first open-source text-to-image model on long structured captions, where every training sample is annotated with the same set of fine-grained attributes. This design maximizes expressive coverage and enables disentangled control over visual factors. To process long captions efficiently, we propose DimFusion, a fusion mechanism that integrates intermediate tokens from a lightweight LLM without increasing token length. We also introduce the Text-as-a-Bottleneck Reconstruction (TaBR) evaluation protocol. By assessing how well real images can be reconstructed through a captioning-generation loop, TaBR directly measures controllability and expressiveness, even for very long captions where existing evaluation methods fail.

The second stage uses a layout-conditioned diffusion model to synthesize a photorealistic image adhering to this layout. We find that task decomposition is critical for LLM-based spatial planning; by simplifying the initial generation to core objects and completing the layout with rule-based insertion, we improve object recall from 57.2% to 99.9% for complex scenes. For image synthesis, we compare two leading conditioning methods: ControlNet and GLIGEN. After domain-specific finetuning on table-setting datasets, we identify a key trade-off: ControlNet preserves text-based stylistic control but suffers from object hallucination, while GLIGEN provides superior layout fidelity at the cost of reduced prompt-based controllability. Our end-to-end system successfully generates images with specified object counts and plausible spatial arrangements, demonstrating the viability of a decoupled approach for compositionally controlled synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7269\u4f53\u8ba1\u6570\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e03\u5c40\u63a7\u5236\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u7528\u5e03\u5c40\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7269\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u6392\u5217\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528LLM\u4ece\u7269\u4f53\u5217\u8868\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5e03\u5c40\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u5e03\u5c40\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08ControlNet\u548cGLIGEN\uff09\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5148\u751f\u6210\u6838\u5fc3\u7269\u4f53\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u89c4\u5219\u586b\u5145\u5b8c\u6210\u5e03\u5c40\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4ece57.2%\u63d0\u5347\u523099.9%\u3002ControlNet\u4fdd\u6301\u6587\u672c\u98ce\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u7269\u4f53\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0cGLIGEN\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4f46\u6587\u672c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89e3\u8026\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u6307\u5b9a\u7269\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u5408\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u6392\u5217\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002"}}

This fundamental weakness leads to noisy, unstable anomaly scores with a poor signal-to-noise ratio, hindering reliable detection. To address this, we propose Constrained Gaussian-Noise Optimization and Smoothing (COGNOS), a universal, model-agnostic enhancement framework that tackles this issue at its source. COGNOS introduces a novel Gaussian-White Noise Regularization strategy during training, which directly constrains the model's output residuals to conform to a Gaussian white noise distribution. This engineered statistical property creates the ideal precondition for our second contribution: a Kalman Smoothing Post-processor that provably operates as a statistically optimal estimator to denoise the raw anomaly scores. The synergy between these two components allows COGNOS to robustly separate the true anomaly signal from random fluctuations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that COGNOS is highly effective, delivering an average F-score uplift of 57.9% when applied to 12 diverse backbone models across multiple real-world benchmark datasets.

However, their reliance on fixed-size rectangular patches often influences the integrity of complex vascular structures, leading to suboptimal segmentation accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose the adaptive Morph Patch Transformer (MPT), a novel architecture specifically designed for aortic vascular segmentation. Specifically, MPT introduces an adaptive patch partitioning strategy that dynamically generates morphology-aware patches aligned with complex vascular structures. This strategy can preserve semantic integrity of complex vascular structures within individual patches. Moreover, a Semantic Clustering Attention (SCA) method is proposed to dynamically aggregate features from various patches with similar semantic characteristics. This method enhances the model's capability to segment vessels of varying sizes, preserving the integrity of vascular structures.

In this experiment, we classify colorless microplastic particles (50-300 $\u03bc$m) by illuminating them with linearly polarized laser light and capturing their reflected signals using a polarization-sensitive camera. This reflection-based technique successfully circumvents the transmission-based interference issues that plague many conventional methods when applied in water. Using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for image-based classification, we successfully identified three common polymer types, high-density polyethylene, low-density polyethylene, and polypropylene, achieving a peak mean classification accuracy of 80% on the test dataset. A subsequent feature hierarchy analysis demonstrated that the CNN's decision-making process relies mainly on the microstructural integrity and internal texture (polarization patterns) of the particle rather than its macroshape. Critically, we found that the Angle of Linear Polarization (AOLP) signal is significantly more robust against contextual noise than the Degree of Linear Polarization (DOLP) signal. While the AOLP-based classification achieved superior overall performance, its strength lies in distinguishing between the two polyethylene plastics, showing a lower confusion rate between high-density and low-density polyethylene. Conversely, the DOLP signal demonstrated slightly worse overall classification results but excels at accurately identifying the polypropylene class, which it isolated with greater success than AOLP.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u632f\u5149\u6563\u5c04\u7684\u53cd\u5c04\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6c34\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fae\u5851\u6599\u7684\u539f\u4f4d\u5206\u7c7b\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u900f\u5c04\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6c34\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5fae\u5851\u6599\u8fde\u7eed\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u539f\u4f4d\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u504f\u632f\u6fc0\u5149\u7167\u5c04\u65e0\u8272\u5fae\u5851\u6599\u9897\u7c92\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u504f\u632f\u654f\u611f\u76f8\u673a\u6355\u83b7\u53cd\u5c04\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u805a\u5408\u7269\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u805a\u4e59\u70ef\u3001\u4f4e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u805a\u4e59\u70ef\u548c\u805a\u4e19\u70ef\uff09\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u5e73\u5747\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523080%\u3002", "conclusion": "AOLP\u4fe1\u53f7\u6bd4DOLP\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bf9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u566a\u58f0\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\uff0cAOLP\u5728\u533a\u5206\u4e24\u79cd\u805a\u4e59\u70ef\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u800cDOLP\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u805a\u4e19\u70ef\u65b9\u9762\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3002"}}

However, existing methods face two key limitations. Firstly, they often over-rely on high-certainty keywords that explicitly identify the target object while neglecting critical spatial descriptions. Secondly, generalized textual features contain both 2D and 3D descriptive information, thereby capturing an additional dimension of details compared to singular 2D or 3D visual features. This characteristic leads to cross-dimensional interference when refining visual features under text guidance. To overcome these challenges, we propose Mono3DVG-EnSD, a novel framework that integrates two key components: the CLIP-Guided Lexical Certainty Adapter (CLIP-LCA) and the Dimension-Decoupled Module (D2M). The CLIP-LCA dynamically masks high-certainty keywords while retaining low-certainty implicit spatial descriptions, thereby forcing the model to develop a deeper understanding of spatial relationships in captions for object localization. Meanwhile, the D2M decouples dimension-specific (2D/3D) textual features from generalized textual features to guide corresponding visual features at same dimension, which mitigates cross-dimensional interference by ensuring dimensionally-consistent cross-modal interactions.

Recent works improve this by introducing knowledge distillation (KD) techniques, with the pre-trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) used as teachers and the target SNNs as students. This is commonly accomplished through a straightforward element-wise alignment of intermediate features and prediction logits from ANNs and SNNs, often neglecting the intrinsic differences between their architectures. Specifically, ANN's outputs exhibit a continuous distribution, whereas SNN's outputs are characterized by sparsity and discreteness. To mitigate this issue, we introduce two innovative KD strategies. Firstly, we propose the Saliency-scaled Activation Map Distillation (SAMD), which aligns the spike activation map of the student SNN with the class-aware activation map of the teacher ANN. Rather than performing KD directly on the raw %and distinct features of ANN and SNN, our SAMD directs the student to learn from saliency activation maps that exhibit greater semantic and distribution consistency. Additionally, we propose a Noise-smoothed Logits Distillation (NLD), which utilizes Gaussian noise to smooth the sparse logits of student SNN, facilitating the alignment with continuous logits from teacher ANN.

To address shadow-background ambiguity, we leverage linguistic priors through the proposed Vision-language Match Module (VMM) and a Dark-aware Semantic Block (DSB), extracting text-guided features to explicitly differentiate shadows from dark objects. Furthermore, we introduce adaptive mask reweighting to downweight penumbra regions during training and apply edge masks at the final decoder stage for better supervision. For temporal modeling of variable shadow shapes, we propose a Tokenized Temporal Block (TTB) that decouples spatiotemporal learning.

We propose a method for extracting CEs in time series forecasting using exogenous variables, which are frequently encountered in fields such as business and marketing. In addition, we present methods for analyzing the influence of each variable over an entire time series, generating CEs by altering only specific variables, and evaluating the quality of the resulting CEs.

However, existing trait maps remain limited by the high cost and sparse geographic coverage of field-based measurements. Citizen science initiatives offer a largely untapped resource to overcome these limitations, with over 50 million geotagged plant photographs worldwide capturing valuable visual information on plant morphology and physiology. In this study, we introduce PlantTraitNet, a multi-modal, multi-task uncertainty-aware deep learning framework that predictsfour key plant traits (plant height, leaf area, specific leaf area, and nitrogen content) from citizen science photos using weak supervision. By aggregating individual trait predictions across space, we generate global maps of trait distributions. We validate these maps against independent vegetation survey data (sPlotOpen) and benchmark them against leading global trait products. Our results show that PlantTraitNet consistently outperforms existing trait maps across all evaluated traits, demonstrating that citizen science imagery, when integrated with computer vision and geospatial AI, enables not only scalable but also more accurate global trait mapping. This approach offers a powerful new pathway for ecological research and Earth system modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "PlantTraitNet\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u516c\u6c11\u79d1\u5b66\u7167\u7247\u9884\u6d4b\u690d\u7269\u6027\u72b6\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u5168\u7403\u6027\u72b6\u5206\u5e03\u56fe\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u4ea7\u54c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u690d\u7269\u6027\u72b6\u5730\u56fe\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5b9e\u5730\u6d4b\u91cf\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c\u5730\u7406\u8986\u76d6\u7a00\u758f\uff0c\u800c\u5168\u74035000\u591a\u4e07\u5f20\u5730\u7406\u6807\u8bb0\u690d\u7269\u7167\u7247\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1PlantTraitNet\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u4ece\u516c\u6c11\u79d1\u5b66\u7167\u7247\u9884\u6d4b\u690d\u7269\u9ad8\u5ea6\u3001\u53f6\u9762\u79ef\u3001\u6bd4\u53f6\u9762\u79ef\u548c\u6c2e\u542b\u91cf\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6027\u72b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u805a\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5168\u7403\u6027\u72b6\u5206\u5e03\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u72ec\u7acb\u690d\u88ab\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e(sPlotOpen)\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u5168\u7403\u6027\u72b6\u4ea7\u54c1\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0cPlantTraitNet\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u72b6\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u516c\u6c11\u79d1\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u7ed3\u5408\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4AI\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5168\u7403\u6027\u72b6\u5236\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u751f\u6001\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5730\u7403\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u516c\u6c11\u79d1\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u5148\u8fdbAI\u6280\u672f\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5168\u7403\u690d\u7269\u6027\u72b6\u5236\u56fe\u3002"}}

To meet this need, data is collected from multiple domains, such as Wikipedia and GitHub. These domains are heterogeneous in both data quality and the diversity of information they provide. This raises the question of how much we should rely on each domain. Several methods have attempted to address this issue by assigning sampling weights to each data domain using heuristics or approximations. As a first step toward a deeper understanding of the role of data mixing, this work revisits the problem by studying two kinds of weights: sampling weights, which control how much each domain contributes in a batch, and loss weights, which scale the loss from each domain during training. Through a rigorous study of linear regression, we show that these two weights play complementary roles. First, they can reduce the variance of gradient estimates in iterative methods such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Second, they can improve generalization performance by reducing the generalization gap. We provide both theoretical and empirical support for these claims.

However, unlike natural language corpora, RL trajectories are sparse and reward-driven, making standard self-attention inefficient because it distributes weight uniformly across all past tokens rather than emphasizing the few transitions critical for control. To address this, we introduce structured inductive priors into the self-attention mechanism of the dynamics head: (i) per-head memory-length priors that constrain attention to task-specific windows, and (ii) distributional priors that learn smooth Gaussian weightings over past state-action pairs. We integrate these mechanisms into UniZero, a model-based RL agent with a Transformer-based world model that supports planning under partial observability. Experiments on the Atari 100k benchmark show that most efficiency gains arise from the Gaussian prior, which smoothly allocates attention to informative transitions, while memory-length priors often truncate useful signals with overly restrictive cut-offs. In particular, Gaussian Attention achieves a 77% relative improvement in mean human-normalized scores over UniZero. These findings suggest that in partially observable RL domains with non-stationary temporal dependencies, discrete memory windows are difficult to learn reliably, whereas smooth distributional priors flexibly adapt across horizons and yield more robust data efficiency. Overall, our results demonstrate that encoding structured temporal priors directly into self-attention improves the prioritization of informative histories for dynamics modeling under partial observability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5728\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5f52\u7eb3\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6539\u8fdb\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5173\u6ce8\u5173\u952e\u5386\u53f2\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u5747\u5300\u5206\u914d\u6743\u91cd\u7ed9\u6240\u6709\u5386\u53f2\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u800cRL\u8f68\u8ff9\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u5956\u52b1\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u5c11\u6570\u5173\u952e\u8f6c\u6362\u5bf9\u63a7\u5236\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5934\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5f52\u7eb3\u5148\u9a8c\uff1a(1) \u6bcf\u4e2a\u5934\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u957f\u5ea6\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9650\u5236\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\uff1b(2) \u5206\u5e03\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u8fc7\u53bb\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u9ad8\u65af\u52a0\u6743\u3002", "result": "\u5728Atari 100k\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u9ad8\u65af\u5148\u9a8c\u5e26\u6765\u4e8677%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u800c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u957f\u5ea6\u5148\u9a8c\u7531\u4e8e\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u622a\u65ad\u5f80\u5f80\u622a\u65ad\u6709\u7528\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4bRL\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e73\u6ed1\u5206\u5e03\u5148\u9a8c\u6bd4\u79bb\u6563\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7a97\u53e3\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

However, such a CLIP-based metric is vulnerable for its delicate multimodal alignment. In this work, we propose \\textbf{FoCLIP}, a feature-space misalignment framework for fooling CLIP-based image quality metric. Based on the stochastic gradient descent technique, FoCLIP integrates three key components to construct fooling examples: feature alignment as the core module to reduce image-text modality gaps, the score distribution balance module and pixel-guard regularization, which collectively optimize multimodal output equilibrium between CLIPscore performance and image quality. Such a design can be engineered to maximize the CLIPscore predictions across diverse input prompts, despite exhibiting either visual unrecognizability or semantic incongruence with the corresponding adversarial prompts from human perceptual perspectives. Experiments on ten artistic masterpiece prompts and ImageNet subsets demonstrate that optimized images can achieve significant improvement in CLIPscore while preserving high visual fidelity. In addition, we found that grayscale conversion induces significant feature degradation in fooling images, exhibiting noticeable CLIPscore reduction while preserving statistical consistency with original images.

These limitations hinder their ability to capture the sharp, high-frequency signals that often define tabular structure, especially under limited labeled samples. While self-supervised learning (SSL) offers promise in such settings, it remains challenging in tabular domains due to the lack of effective data augmentations. We propose a hybrid autoencoder that combines a neural encoder with an oblivious soft decision tree (OSDT) encoder, each guided by its own stochastic gating network that performs sample-specific feature selection. Together, these structurally different encoders and model-specific gating networks implement model-based augmentation, producing complementary input views tailored to each architecture. The two encoders, trained with a shared decoder and cross-reconstruction loss, learn distinct yet aligned representations that reflect their respective inductive biases. During training, the OSDT encoder (robust to noise and effective at modeling localized, high-frequency structure) guides the neural encoder toward representations more aligned with tabular data. At inference, only the neural encoder is used, preserving flexibility and SSL compatibility. Spectral analysis highlights the distinct inductive biases of each encoder.

While hybrid SPECT/CT systems mitigate these artifacts through CT-derived attenuation maps, their high cost, limited accessibility, and added radiation exposure hinder widespread clinical adoption. In this study, we propose a novel CT-free solution to attenuation correction in cardiac SPECT. Specifically, we introduce Physics-aware Attenuation Correction Diffusion Model (PADM), a diffusion-based generative method that incorporates explicit physics priors via a teacher--student distillation mechanism. This approach enables attenuation artifact correction using only Non-Attenuation-Corrected (NAC) input, while still benefiting from physics-informed supervision during training. To support this work, we also introduce CardiAC, a comprehensive dataset comprising 424 patient studies with paired NAC and Attenuation-Corrected (AC) reconstructions, alongside high-resolution CT-based attenuation maps.

However, existing 3DGS-based video codecs generally exhibit more noticeable visual artifacts and relatively low compression ratios. In this paper, we specifically target the perceptual enhancement of 3DGS-based video compression, based on the assumption that artifacts from 3DGS rendering and quantization resemble noisy latents sampled during diffusion training. Building on this premise, we propose a content-adaptive framework, GFix, comprising a streamlined, single-step diffusion model that serves as an off-the-shelf neural enhancer. Moreover, to increase compression efficiency, We propose a modulated LoRA scheme that freezes the low-rank decompositions and modulates the intermediate hidden states, thereby achieving efficient adaptation of the diffusion backbone with highly compressible updates. Experimental results show that GFix delivers strong perceptual quality enhancement, outperforming GSVC with up to 72.1% BD-rate savings in LPIPS and 21.4% in FID.", "AI": {"tldr": "GFix\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u89c6\u9891\u538b\u7f29\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b65\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8c03\u5236LoRA\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u7387\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u76843DGS\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u89c6\u89c9\u4f2a\u5f71\u548c\u8f83\u4f4e\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5047\u8bbe\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4f2a\u5f71\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6f5c\u5728\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u611f\u77e5\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5185\u5bb9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6GFix\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5355\u6b65\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u589e\u5f3a\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8c03\u5236LoRA\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u51bb\u7ed3\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u5e76\u8c03\u5236\u4e2d\u95f4\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u6269\u6563\u4e3b\u5e72\u9002\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aGFix\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4GSVC\u5728LPIPS\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe72.1%\u7684BD-rate\u8282\u7701\uff0c\u5728FID\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b021.4%\u7684\u8282\u7701\u3002", "conclusion": "GFix\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u5347\u4e863DGS\u89c6\u9891\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u914d\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

However, existing SC methods, which are largely based on linear models or shallow neural networks, face significant limitations in terms of scalability and capacity when applied to real-world datasets with significantly increasing scale, especially in financial services and the internet sector. In this paper, we investigate how to leverage large language models to design a more scalable and efficient SC framework, especially in the case of growing individuals engaged with decision-making processes. Specifically, we introduce GLIM, a gradient-free SC method grounded in in-context learning. During the feed-forward process of self-attention, GLIM implicitly simulates the typical bi-level optimization process of SC, including both the feature manipulation and decision rule optimization. Without fine-tuning the LLMs, our proposed GLIM enjoys the advantage of cost-effective adaptation in dynamic strategic environments. Theoretically, we prove GLIM can support pre-trained LLMs to adapt to a broad range of strategic manipulations.

One of the key issues pertains to limited real-world annotated data to facilitate generalizable models. The common practice to tackle this issue is to simulate new data. Although synthetic datasets offer scalability and perfect labels, their designer-crafted scenes fail to capture real-world complexity and sensor noise, resulting in a synthetic-to-real domain gap. Moreover, no benchmark provides synchronized real and simulated point clouds for segmentation-oriented domain shift analysis. We introduce TrueCity, the first urban semantic segmentation benchmark with cm-accurate annotated real-world point clouds, semantic 3D city models, and annotated simulated point clouds representing the same city. TrueCity proposes segmentation classes aligned with international 3D city modeling standards, enabling consistent evaluation of synthetic-to-real gap. Our extensive experiments on common baselines quantify domain shift and highlight strategies for exploiting synthetic data to enhance real-world 3D scene understanding.

Prior work often utilizes model ensembles or multi-agent systems to collaboratively generate responses, effectively operating in a server-to-server paradigm. However, such approaches do not align well with practical deployment settings, where a limited number of server-side models are shared by many clients under modern internet architectures. In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{CoLM} (\\textbf{Co}llaboration in \\textbf{L}arge-\\textbf{M}odels), a novel framework for collaborative reasoning that redefines cooperation among large models from a client-server perspective. Unlike traditional ensemble methods that rely on simultaneous inference from multiple models to produce a single output, CoLM allows the outputs of multiple models to be aggregated or shared, enabling each client model to independently refine and update its own generation based on these high-quality outputs.

However, recent studies reveal that point cloud classifiers are vulnerable to structured adversarial perturbations and geometric corruptions, posing risks to their deployment in safety-critical scenarios. Existing certified defenses limit point-wise perturbations but overlook subtle geometric distortions that preserve individual points yet alter the overall structure, potentially leading to misclassification. In this work, we propose FreqCert, a novel certification framework that departs from conventional spatial domain defenses by shifting robustness analysis to the frequency domain, enabling structured certification against global L2-bounded perturbations. FreqCert first transforms the input point cloud via the graph Fourier transform (GFT), then applies structured frequency-aware subsampling to generate multiple sub-point clouds. Each sub-cloud is independently classified by a standard model, and the final prediction is obtained through majority voting, where sub-clouds are constructed based on spectral similarity rather than spatial proximity, making the partitioning more stable under L2 perturbations and better aligned with the object's intrinsic structure. We derive a closed-form lower bound on the certified L2 robustness radius and prove its tightness under minimal and interpretable assumptions, establishing a theoretical foundation for frequency domain certification. Extensive experiments on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets demonstrate that FreqCert consistently achieves higher certified accuracy and empirical accuracy under strong perturbations.

This auxiliary task guides the model to accurately localize binding residues within the protein sequence and capture their 3D spatial arrangement, thereby refining protein-ligand matching.

Conventional defense mechanisms struggle to address the evolving landscape of multifaceted attack patterns. Through systematic analysis of existing defenses, we identify that their unsatisfactory performance primarily originates from an entangled feature space, where adversarial attacks can be performed easily. To this end, we present 3D-ANC, a novel approach that capitalizes on the Neural Collapse (NC) mechanism to orchestrate discriminative feature learning. In particular, NC depicts where last-layer features and classifier weights jointly evolve into a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF) arrangement, establishing maximally separable class prototypes. However, leveraging this advantage in 3D recognition confronts two substantial challenges: (1) prevalent class imbalance in point cloud datasets, and (2) complex geometric similarities between object categories. To tackle these obstacles, our solution combines an ETF-aligned classification module with an adaptive training framework consisting of representation-balanced learning (RBL) and dynamic feature direction loss (FDL). 3D-ANC seamlessly empowers existing models to develop disentangled feature spaces despite the complexity in 3D data distribution. Comprehensive evaluations state that 3D-ANC significantly improves the robustness of models with various structures on two datasets.

However, existing GAD methods assume identical training and testing distributions, which is rarely valid in practice. In real-world scenarios, unseen but normal samples may emerge during deployment, leading to a normality shift that degrades the performance of GAD models trained on the original data. Through empirical analysis, we reveal that the degradation arises from (1) semantic confusion, where unseen normal samples are misinterpreted as anomalies due to their novel patterns, and (2) aggregation contamination, where the representations of seen normal nodes are distorted by unseen normals through message aggregation. While retraining or fine-tuning GAD models could be a potential solution to the above challenges, the high cost of model retraining and the difficulty of obtaining labeled data often render this approach impractical in real-world applications. To bridge the gap, we proposed a lightweight and plug-and-play Test-time adaptation framework for correcting Unseen Normal pattErns (TUNE) in GAD. To address semantic confusion, a graph aligner is employed to align the shifted data to the original one at the graph attribute level. Moreover, we utilize the minimization of representation-level shift as a supervision signal to train the aligner, which leverages the estimated aggregation contamination as a key indicator of normality shift.

However, the open accessibility of VFMs also introduces critical security risks, as adversaries can exploit full knowledge of the VFMs to launch potent attacks. This paper investigates a novel and practical adversarial threat scenario: attacking downstream models or MLLMs fine-tuned from open-source VFMs, without requiring access to the victim task, training data, model query, and architecture. In contrast to conventional transfer-based attacks that rely on task-aligned surrogate models, we demonstrate that adversarial vulnerabilities can be exploited directly from the VFMs. To this end, we propose the Transferable Video Attack (TVA), a temporal-aware adversarial attack method that leverages the temporal representation dynamics of VFMs to craft effective perturbations. TVA integrates a bidirectional contrastive learning mechanism to maximize the discrepancy between the clean and adversarial features, and introduces a temporal consistency loss that exploits motion cues to enhance the sequential impact of perturbations. TVA avoids the need to train expensive surrogate models or access to domain-specific data, thereby offering a more practical and efficient attack strategy. Extensive experiments across 24 video-related tasks demonstrate the efficacy of TVA against downstream models and MLLMs, revealing a previously underexplored security vulnerability in the deployment of video models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b(VFMs)\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5TVA\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u67e5\u8be2\u6216\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4ec5\u5229\u7528\u5f00\u6e90VFMs\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u8868\u793a\u52a8\u6001\u6765\u5236\u4f5c\u6709\u6548\u6270\u52a8\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528VFMs\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u77e5\u8bc6\u53d1\u8d77\u6709\u6548\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u5a01\u80c1\u573a\u666f\uff1a\u653b\u51fb\u4ece\u5f00\u6e90VFMs\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTVA(\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u89c6\u9891\u653b\u51fb)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528VFMs\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u8868\u793a\u52a8\u6001\u5236\u4f5c\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u53cc\u5411\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5e72\u51c0\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u7279\u5f81\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u6765\u5229\u7528\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ebf\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u572824\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86TVA\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u6a21\u578b\u548cMLLMs\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5148\u524d\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "conclusion": "TVA\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u8bbf\u95ee\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002"}}

Data augmentation via synthetic fake face generation effectively enhances generalization, yet current SoTA methods rely on fixed strategies-raising a key question: Is a single static augmentation sufficient, or does the diversity of forgery features demand dynamic approaches? We argue existing methods overlook the evolving complexity of real-world forgeries (e.g., facial warping, expression manipulation), which fixed policies cannot fully simulate. To address this, we propose CRDA (Curriculum Reinforcement-Learning Data Augmentation), a novel framework guiding detectors to progressively master multi-domain forgery features from simple to complex. CRDA synthesizes augmented samples via a configurable pool of forgery operations and dynamically generates adversarial samples tailored to the detector's current learning state. Central to our approach is integrating reinforcement learning (RL) and causal inference. An RL agent dynamically selects augmentation actions based on detector performance to efficiently explore the vast augmentation space, adapting to increasingly challenging forgeries. Simultaneously, the agent introduces action space variations to generate heterogeneous forgery patterns, guided by causal inference to mitigate spurious correlations-suppressing task-irrelevant biases and focusing on causally invariant features.

However, its utility is significantly limited by the sparsity and low resolution of radar point clouds, which poses challenges for tasks requiring dense and accurate 3D perception. Despite that recent efforts have shown great potential by exploring generative approaches to address this issue, they often rely on dense voxel representations that are inefficient and struggle to preserve structural detail. To fill this gap, we make the key observation that latent diffusion models (LDMs), though successful in other modalities, have not been effectively leveraged for radar-based 3D generation due to a lack of compatible representations and conditioning strategies. We introduce RaLD, a framework that bridges this gap by integrating scene-level frustum-based LiDAR autoencoding, order-invariant latent representations, and direct radar spectrum conditioning. These insights lead to a more compact and expressive generation process.

However, a significant limitation of current methods is their reliance on a pre-defined set of in-distribution (ID) ground-truth label names (positives). These fixed label names can be unavailable, unreliable at scale, or become less relevant due to in-distribution shifts after deployment. Towards truly unsupervised OOD detection, we utilize widely available text corpora for positive label mining, bypassing the need for positives. In this paper, we utilize widely available text corpora for positive label mining under a general concept mining paradigm. Within this framework, we propose ClusterMine, a novel positive label mining method. ClusterMine is the first method to achieve state-of-the-art OOD detection performance without access to positive labels. It extracts positive concepts from a large text corpus by combining visual-only sample consistency (via clustering) and zero-shot image-text consistency. Our experimental study reveals that ClusterMine is scalable across a plethora of CLIP models and achieves state-of-the-art robustness to covariate in-distribution shifts.

Current popular strategies adopt multilayer perceptron (MLP) as the backbone, supplemented by additional modules to enhance the network ability to handle context information, which is a known limitation of MLPs. In contrast, we introduce a novel perspective for capturing correspondence context information without extra design modules. To this end, we design a two-view correspondence pruning network called LeCoT, which can naturally leverage global context information at different stages. Specifically, the core design of LeCoT is the Spatial-Channel Fusion Transformer block, a newly proposed component that efficiently utilizes both spatial and channel global context information among sparse correspondences. In addition, we integrate the proposed prediction block that utilizes correspondence features from intermediate stages to generate a probability set, which acts as guiding information for subsequent learning phases, allowing the network to more effectively capture robust global context information. Notably, this prediction block progressively refines the probability set, thereby mitigating the issue of information loss that is common in the traditional one. Extensive experiments prove that the proposed LeCoT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in correspondence pruning, relative pose estimation, homography estimation, visual localization, and $3$D~reconstruction tasks.

With latent variables drawn from a tractable probability density function that can be further constrained, these models enable continuous and semantically rich exploration of the output space by navigating their latent spaces. Structured latent representations are typically obtained through the joint minimization of regularization loss functions. In variational information bottleneck models, reconstruction loss and Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) are often linearly combined with an auxiliary Attribute-Regularization (AR) loss. However, balancing KLD and AR turns out to be a very delicate matter. When KLD dominates over AR, generative models tend to lack controllability; when AR dominates over KLD, the stochastic encoder is encouraged to violate the standard normal prior.

However, their synergy remains poorly understood, largely due to the lack of systematic benchmarks evaluating their integration in clinical risk prediction. In real-world healthcare, identifying features with causal influence on outcomes is crucial for actionable and trustworthy predictions. While recent work highlights LLMs' emerging causal reasoning abilities, there lacks comprehensive benchmarks to assess their causal learning and performance informed by causal features in clinical risk prediction. To address this, we introduce REACT-LLM, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether combining LLMs with causal features can enhance clinical prognostic performance and potentially outperform traditional machine learning (ML) methods. Unlike existing LLM-clinical benchmarks that often focus on a limited set of outcomes, REACT-LLM evaluates 7 clinical outcomes across 2 real-world datasets, comparing 15 prominent LLMs, 6 traditional ML models, and 3 causal discovery (CD) algorithms. Our findings indicate that while LLMs perform reasonably in clinical prognostics, they have not yet outperformed traditional ML models. Integrating causal features derived from CD algorithms into LLMs offers limited performance gains, primarily due to the strict assumptions of many CD methods, which are often violated in complex clinical data. While the direct integration yields limited improvement, our benchmark reveals a more promising synergy.", "AI": {"tldr": "REACT-LLM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u7279\u5f81\u7ed3\u5408\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u540e\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u5408\u7406\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edfML\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u56e0\u679c\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6574\u5408\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u90fd\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6574\u5408\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165REACT-LLM\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f307\u4e2a\u4e34\u5e8a\u7ed3\u5c40\u30012\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f8315\u4e2aLLMs\u30016\u4e2a\u4f20\u7edfML\u6a21\u578b\u548c3\u4e2a\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u56e0\u679c\u7279\u5f81\u4e0eLLMs\u7684\u6574\u5408\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u540e\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u5408\u7406\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edfML\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u56e0\u679c\u7279\u5f81\u4e0eLLMs\u7684\u6574\u5408\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u5047\u8bbe\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5e38\u88ab\u8fdd\u53cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136\u76f4\u63a5\u6574\u5408\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765LLMs\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u878d\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, current research tends to focus narrowly on single-object prompts with limited contextual diversity. In reality, each object or attribute within a prompt can contribute to bias. For example, the prompt \"an assistant wearing a pink hat\" may reflect female-inclined biases associated with a pink hat. The neglected joint effects of the semantic binding in the prompts cause significant failures in current debiasing approaches. This work initiates a preliminary investigation on how bias manifests under semantic binding, where contextual associations between objects and attributes influence generative outcomes. We demonstrate that the underlying bias distribution can be amplified based on these associations. Therefore, we introduce a bias adherence score that quantifies how specific object-attribute bindings activate bias. To delve deeper, we develop a training-free context-bias control framework to explore how token decoupling can facilitate the debiasing of semantic bindings.

However, existing methodologies primarily rely on musical context or natural language as the main modality of interacting with the generative process, which may not be ideal for expert users who seek precise fader-like control over specific musical attributes. In this work, we explore the application of denoising diffusion processes as plug-and-play latent constraints for unconditional symbolic music generation models. We focus on a framework that leverages a library of small conditional diffusion models operating as implicit probabilistic priors on the latents of a frozen unconditional backbone. While previous studies have explored domain-specific use cases, this work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to demonstrate the versatility of such an approach across a diverse array of musical attributes, such as note density, pitch range, contour, and rhythm complexity.

However, generative modeling for HSIs presents several challenges. Due to their high spectral dimensionality, HSIs are too memory-intensive for direct input into conventional diffusion models. Furthermore, general generative models lack an understanding of the topological and geometric structures of ground objects in remote sensing imagery. In addition, most diffusion models optimize loss functions at the noise level, leading to a non-intuitive convergence behavior and suboptimal generation quality for complex data. To address these challenges, we propose a Geometric Enhanced Wavelet-based Diffusion Model (GEWDiff), a novel framework for reconstructing hyperspectral images at 4-times super-resolution. A wavelet-based encoder-decoder is introduced that efficiently compresses HSIs into a latent space while preserving spectral-spatial information. To avoid distortion during generation, we incorporate a geometry-enhanced diffusion process that preserves the geometric features. Furthermore, a multi-level loss function was designed to guide the diffusion process, promoting stable convergence and improved reconstruction fidelity.

While large image encoders, high-resolution images, and long-term temporal inputs can significantly enhance feature quality and deliver remarkable performance gains, these techniques are often incompatible in both training and inference due to computational resource constraints. Moreover, different tasks favor distinct feature representations, making it difficult for a single model to perform end-to-end inference across multiple tasks while maintaining accuracy comparable to that of single-task models. To alleviate these issues, we present the HENet and HENet++ framework for multi-task 3D perception and end-to-end autonomous driving. Specifically, we propose a hybrid image encoding network that uses a large image encoder for short-term frames and a small one for long-term frames. Furthermore, our framework simultaneously extracts both dense and sparse features, providing more suitable representations for different tasks, reducing cumulative errors, and delivering more comprehensive information to the planning module. The proposed architecture maintains compatibility with various existing 3D feature extraction methods and supports multimodal inputs. HENet++ achieves state-of-the-art end-to-end multi-task 3D perception results on the nuScenes benchmark, while also attaining the lowest collision rate on the nuScenes end-to-end autonomous driving benchmark.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86HENet\u548cHENet++\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4efb\u52a13D\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u53d6\u7a20\u5bc6\u7a00\u758f\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u548c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b33D\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u4e0e\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u957f\u671f\u65f6\u5e8f\u8f93\u5165\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u5927\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5904\u7406\u77ed\u671f\u5e27\uff0c\u5c0f\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5904\u7406\u957f\u671f\u5e27\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u53d6\u7a20\u5bc6\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9\u73b0\u67093D\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5728nuScenes\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u591a\u4efb\u52a13D\u611f\u77e5\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728nuScenes\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f4e\u78b0\u649e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "HENet++\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u4efb\u52a13D\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

We observe that dynamic reconstruction methods fail in both canonical and deformed spaces under sparse-frame settings, especially in areas with high texture richness. Sparse4DGS tackles this challenge by focusing on texture-rich areas. For the deformation network, we propose Texture-Aware Deformation Regularization, which introduces a texture-based depth alignment loss to regulate Gaussian deformation. For the canonical Gaussian field, we introduce Texture-Aware Canonical Optimization, which incorporates texture-based noise into the gradient descent process of canonical Gaussians.

Evaluating whether a painting faithfully reflects the music that inspired it poses a challenging perceptual assessment task. Existing methods primarily rely on emotion recognition models to assess the similarity between music and painting, but such models introduce considerable noise and overlook broader perceptual cues beyond emotion. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for music induced painting assessment that directly models perceptual coherence between music and visual art. We introduce MPD, the first large scale dataset of music painting pairs annotated by domain experts based on perceptual coherence. To better handle ambiguous cases, we further collect pairwise preference annotations.

Traditional methods typically rely on logical labels, such as binary indicators (e.g., \"yes/no\") that specify whether an instance belongs to a given category. However, in practical applications, label annotations often involve significant uncertainty due to factors such as data noise, inherent ambiguity in the observed entities, and the subjectivity of human annotators. Therefore, representing labels using simplistic binary logic can obscure valuable information and limit the expressiveness of label learning models. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the concept of fuzzy labels, grounded in fuzzy set theory, to better capture and represent label uncertainty. We further propose an efficient fuzzy labeling method that mines and generates fuzzy labels from the original data, thereby enriching the label space with more informative and nuanced representations. Based on this foundation, we present fuzzy-label-enhanced algorithms for both single-label and multi-label learning, using the classical K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and multi-label KNN algorithms as illustrative examples. Experimental results indicate that fuzzy labels can more effectively characterize the real-world labeling information and significantly enhance the performance of label learning models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u7cca\u96c6\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6807\u7b7e\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8868\u793a\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u6316\u6398\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u7cca\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6807\u7b7e\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6807\u7b7e\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e8c\u5143\u903b\u8f91\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u5b9e\u4f53\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u7cca\u6807\u7b7e\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u6316\u6398\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u7cca\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5355\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6807\u7b7e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5KNN\u548c\u591a\u6807\u7b7eKNN\u4e3a\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bf4\u660e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6a21\u7cca\u6807\u7b7e\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8868\u5f81\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6807\u7b7e\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u7cca\u6807\u7b7e\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6355\u6349\u548c\u8868\u793a\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6807\u7b7e\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u548c\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Inspired by the prevalent use of procedural generators in production 3D applications, we propose a sequentialized, graph-based procedural graph representation for 3D assets. We use this to learn to approximate the landscape of a procedural generator for image-based 3D reconstruction. We employ edge-based tokenization to encode the procedural graphs, and train a transformer prior to predict the next token conditioned on an input RGB image. Crucially, to enable better alignment of our generated outputs to an input image, we incorporate Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) guided sampling into our generation process, steering output procedural graphs towards more image-faithful reconstructions. Our approach is applicable across a variety of objects that can be synthesized with procedural generators.

Federated learning preserves privacy but deploying large vision-language models (VLMs) introduces major energy and sustainability challenges. We compare three strategies for federated violence detection under realistic non-IID splits on the RWF-2000 and RLVS datasets: zero-shot inference with pretrained VLMs, LoRA-based fine-tuning of LLaVA-NeXT-Video-7B, and personalized federated learning of a 65.8M-parameter 3D CNN. All methods exceed 90% accuracy in binary violence detection. The 3D CNN achieves superior calibration (ROC AUC 92.59%) at roughly half the energy cost (240 Wh vs. 570 Wh) of federated LoRA, while VLMs provide richer multimodal reasoning. Hierarchical category grouping (based on semantic similarity and class exclusion) boosts VLM multiclass accuracy from 65.31% to 81% on the UCF-Crime dataset.

This highlights the urgent need for continuously updating AI-generated image detectors to adapt to new generators. To overcome low efficiency and catastrophic forgetting in detector updates, we propose LiteUpdate, a lightweight framework for updating AI-generated image detectors. LiteUpdate employs a representative sample selection module that leverages image confidence and gradient-based discriminative features to precisely select boundary samples. This approach improves learning and detection accuracy on new distributions with limited generated images, significantly enhancing detector update efficiency. Additionally, LiteUpdate incorporates a model merging module that fuses weights from multiple fine-tuning trajectories, including pre-trained, representative, and random updates. This balances the adaptability to new generators and mitigates the catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge. Experiments demonstrate that LiteUpdate substantially boosts detection performance in various detectors.

We tackle these limitations by extending SMiLE, a recently proposed enforcement framework for NNs, to support global relational properties (defined over the entire input space). The proposed approach scales well with model complexity, accommodates general properties and backbones, and provides full satisfaction guarantees. We evaluate SMiLE on monotonicity, global robustness, and individual fairness, on synthetic and real data, for regression and classification tasks.

We compare a direct approach to a specialized global-to-local learning strategy and find mean absolute errors on the relevant anatomical measurements of 0.506mm for the Keros, 4.516\u00b0 for the Gera and 0.802mm / 0.777mm for the TMS classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u70ed\u56fe\u56de\u5f52\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5173\u952e\u89e3\u5256\u6807\u5fd7\u70b9\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u9f3b\u7aa6\u624b\u672f\u7684\u9885\u5e95\u89e3\u5256\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8017\u65f6\u7684\u624b\u52a8\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u9f3b\u7aa6\u624b\u672f\u9700\u8981\u672f\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u9885\u5e95\u89e3\u5256\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u8111\u810a\u6db2\u6f0f\u7b49\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u73b0\u6709Keros\u3001Gera\u548cTMS\u7b49\u89e3\u5256\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\u9700\u8981\u8017\u65f6\u7684\u624b\u52a8\u6d4b\u91cf\u51a0\u72b6CT\u6216CBCT\u626b\u63cf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u70ed\u56fe\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5173\u952e\u89e3\u5256\u6807\u5fd7\u70b9\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u8ba1\u7b97\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5230\u5c40\u90e8\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u89e3\u5256\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\uff1aKeros\u8bc4\u52060.506mm\uff0cGera\u8bc4\u52064.516\u00b0\uff0cTMS\u5206\u7c7b0.802mm/0.777mm\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7ba1\u9053\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u9f3b\u7aa6\u624b\u672f\u7684\u89e3\u5256\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u4e3a\u672f\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To appear in AAAI '26 (Oral). This paper extends the AAAI-2026 version by including the Appendix", "summary": "Clean-image backdoor attacks, which use only label manipulation in training datasets to compromise deep neural networks, pose a significant threat to security-critical applications. A critical flaw in existing methods is that the poison rate required for a successful attack induces a proportional, and thus noticeable, drop in Clean Accuracy (CA), undermining their stealthiness. This paper presents a new paradigm for clean-image attacks that minimizes this accuracy degradation by optimizing the trigger itself. We introduce Generative Clean-Image Backdoors (GCB), a framework that uses a conditional InfoGAN to identify naturally occurring image features that can serve as potent and stealthy triggers.

This study introduces a remote sensing-driven framework to quantify WASH accessibility-specifically to water pumps, latrines, and bathing cubicles-in the Rohingya camps of Cox's Bazar, one of the world's most densely populated displacement settings. Detecting refugee shelters in such emergent camps presents substantial challenges, primarily due to their dense spatial configuration and irregular geometric patterns. Using sub-meter satellite images, we develop a semi-supervised segmentation framework that achieves an F1-score of 76.4% in detecting individual refugee shelters. Applying the framework across multi-year data reveals declining WASH accessibility, driven by rapid refugee population growth and reduced facility availability, rising from 25 people per facility in 2022 to 29.4 in 2025. Gender-disaggregated analysis further shows that women and girls experience reduced accessibility, in scenarios with inadequate safety-related segregation in WASH facilities.

In the limit of infinitely large widths and small learning rate, the kernel that is obtained allows to represent the output of the learned model with a closed-form solution. This closed-form solution hinges on the invertibility of the limiting kernel, a property that often holds on real-world datasets. In this work, we analyze the sensitivity of large ReLU networks to increasing depths by characterizing the corresponding limiting kernel. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the normalized limiting kernel approaches the matrix of ones. In contrast, they show the corresponding closed-form solution approaches a fixed limit on the sphere.

While reminiscent of denoising autoencoders, our approach differs in two key aspects. First, instead of unstructured i.i.d.\\ noise, we apply structured, spatially coherent perturbations that make the task a hybrid of segmentation and inpainting. Second, and counterintuitively, we add and preserve Gaussian noise on top of the occlusions, which acts as a Tikhonov regularizer anchoring the Jacobian of the reconstruction function toward identity. This identity-anchored regularization stabilizes reconstruction and further improves both detection and segmentation accuracy.

Current multi-modal solutions suffer from static semantic rigidity: predefined candidate words fail to adapt to dataset-specific concepts, and fixed fusion strategies ignore evolving feature interactions. To overcome these limitations, we propose Multi-DProxy, a novel multi-modal dynamic proxy learning framework that leverages cross-modal alignment through learnable textual proxies. Multi-DProxy introduces 1) gated cross-modal fusion that synthesizes discriminative joint representations by adaptively modeling feature interactions. 2) dual-constraint proxy optimization where user interest constraints enforce semantic consistency with domain concepts while concept constraints employ hard example mining to enhance cluster discrimination. 3) dynamic candidate management that refines textual proxies through iterative clustering feedback. Therefore, Multi-DProxy not only effectively captures a user's interest through proxies but also enables the identification of relevant clusterings with greater precision.

While numerous methods have been proposed to detect anomalous objects on the road, leveraging the vision-language space-which provides rich linguistic knowledge-remains an underexplored field. We hypothesize that incorporating these linguistic cues can be especially beneficial in the complex contexts found in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.\n  To this end, we present a novel approach that trains a Text-Driven OOD Segmentation model to learn a semantically diverse set of objects in the vision-language space. Concretely, our approach combines a vision-language model's encoder with a transformer decoder, employs Distance-Based OOD prompts located at varying semantic distances from in-distribution (ID) classes, and utilizes OOD Semantic Augmentation for OOD representations. By aligning visual and textual information, our approach effectively generalizes to unseen objects and provides robust OOD segmentation in diverse driving environments.\n  We conduct extensive experiments on publicly available OOD segmentation datasets such as Fishyscapes, Segment-Me-If-You-Can, and Road Anomaly datasets, demonstrating that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across both pixel-level and object-level evaluations. This result underscores the potential of vision-language-based OOD segmentation to bolster the safety and reliability of future autonomous driving systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684OOD\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548cTransformer\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8ddd\u79bb\u9a71\u52a8\u7684OOD\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f02\u5e38\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5206\u5272\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u9053\u8def\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u51b3\u7b56\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8eOOD\u5206\u5272\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u8bb8\u591a\u65b9\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u9053\u8def\u4e0a\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u4f46\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u7a7a\u95f4\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bed\u8a00\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u9886\u57df\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5047\u8bbe\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u878d\u5165\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bed\u8a00\u7ebf\u7d22\u7279\u522b\u6709\u76ca\u3002", "method": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u6587\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684OOD\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u96c6\u5408\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548cTransformer\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684OOD\u63d0\u793a\uff08\u4f4d\u4e8e\u4e0eID\u7c7b\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u4e49\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff09\uff1b\u91c7\u7528OOD\u8bed\u4e49\u589e\u5f3a\u6765\u589e\u5f3aOOD\u8868\u793a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9f50\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5728Fishyscapes\u3001Segment-Me-If-You-Can\u548cRoad Anomaly\u7b49\u516c\u5f00OOD\u5206\u5272\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u7ea7\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u90fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u7684OOD\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u589e\u5f3a\u672a\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

To address these problems, we propose a novel 4D generation network called 4DSTR, which modulates generative 4D Gaussian Splatting with spatial-temporal rectification. Specifically, temporal correlation across generated 4D sequences is designed to rectify deformable scales and rotations and guarantee temporal consistency. Furthermore, an adaptive spatial densification and pruning strategy is proposed to address significant temporal variations by dynamically adding or deleting Gaussian points with the awareness of their pre-frame movements.

In this framework, two graph construction branches perform node and edge embedding, respectively, to generate informative graphs.

However, current Video-LLMs still face challenges with long real-world videos. Recent methods have introduced a retrieval mechanism that retrieves query-relevant KV caches for question answering, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of long real-world videos. However, the compression and retrieval of KV caches are still not fully explored. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{StreamKV}, a training-free framework that seamlessly equips Video-LLMs with advanced KV cache retrieval and compression. Compared to previous methods that used uniform partitioning, StreamKV dynamically partitions video streams into semantic segments, which better preserves semantic information. For KV cache retrieval, StreamKV calculates a summary vector for each segment to retain segment-level information essential for retrieval. For KV cache compression, StreamKV introduces a guidance prompt designed to capture the key semantic elements within each segment, ensuring only the most informative KV caches are retained for answering questions. Moreover, StreamKV unifies KV cache retrieval and compression within a single module, performing both in a layer-adaptive manner, thereby further improving the effectiveness of streaming video question answering. Extensive experiments on public StreamingVQA benchmarks demonstrate that StreamKV significantly outperforms existing Online Video-LLMs, achieving superior accuracy while substantially improving both memory efficiency and computational latency.

We establish analogies between training hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, weight decay) and thermodynamic variables such as temperature, pressure, and volume. Starting with a simplified isotropic noise model, we uncover a close correspondence between SGD dynamics and ideal gas behavior, validated through theory and simulation.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is sensitive to acute ischemic stroke and is a common diagnostic method for stroke. However, manual lesion segmentation performed by experts is tedious, time-consuming, and prone to observer inconsistency. Automatic medical image analysis methods have been proposed to overcome this challenge. However, previous approaches have relied on hand-crafted features that may not capture the irregular and physiologically complex shapes of ischemic stroke lesions. In this study, we present a novel framework for quickly and automatically segmenting ischemic stroke lesions on various MRI sequences, including T1-weighted, T2-weighted, DWI, and FLAIR. The proposed methodology is validated on the ISLES 2015 Brain Stroke sequence dataset, where we trained our model using the Res-Unet architecture twice: first, with pre-existing weights, and then without, to explore the benefits of transfer learning.

The new set-up involves a template-driven generator, runner, and evaluation framework that, through systematic permutations of convolutional, normalization, activation, and dropout layers, can create more than 1,200 variants of neural networks. Fractal templates allow for structural recursion and multi-column pathways, thus, models become deeper and wider in a balanced way.

However, existing approaches often neglect the deeper causal relationships and interactions between objects, which are critical for understanding anomalous behaviors. In this paper, we propose VADER, an LLM-driven framework for Video Anomaly unDErstanding, which integrates keyframe object Relation features with visual cues to enhance anomaly comprehension from video. Specifically, VADER first applies an Anomaly Scorer to assign per-frame anomaly scores, followed by a Context-AwarE Sampling (CAES) strategy to capture the causal context of each anomalous event. A Relation Feature Extractor and a COntrastive Relation Encoder (CORE) jointly model dynamic object interactions, producing compact relational representations for downstream reasoning. These visual and relational cues are integrated with LLMs to generate detailed, causally grounded descriptions and support robust anomaly-related question answering.

In contrast, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), pretrained on massive and diverse data, exhibit strong perception capabilities and broad generalization, yet their potential remains largely untapped in the SFOD setting. In this paper, we propose a novel SFOD framework that leverages VFMs as external knowledge sources to jointly enhance feature alignment and label quality. Specifically, we design three VFM-based modules: (1) Patch-weighted Global Feature Alignment (PGFA) distills global features from VFMs using patch-similarity-based weighting to enhance global feature transferability; (2) Prototype-based Instance Feature Alignment (PIFA) performs instance-level contrastive learning guided by momentum-updated VFM prototypes; and (3) Dual-source Enhanced Pseudo-label Fusion (DEPF) fuses predictions from detection VFMs and teacher models via an entropy-aware strategy to yield more reliable supervision.

While these expressive models do not yet match the peak performance of state-of-the-art Transformers, their potential has been largely untapped due to prohibitively slow training and low hardware utilization. Existing parallelization methods force a fundamental conflict governed by the chunksize hyperparameter: large chunks boost speed but degrade performance, necessitating a fixed, suboptimal compromise. To solve this challenge, we introduce TNT, a novel training paradigm that decouples training efficiency from inference performance through a two-stage process. Stage one is an efficiency-focused pre-training phase utilizing a hierarchical memory. A global module processes large, hardware-friendly chunks for long-range context, while multiple parallel local modules handle fine-grained details. Crucially, by periodically resetting local memory states, we break sequential dependencies to enable massive context parallelization. Stage two is a brief fine-tuning phase where only the local memory modules are adapted to a smaller, high-resolution chunksize, maximizing accuracy with minimal overhead. Evaluated on Titans and TTT models, TNT achieves a substantial acceleration in training speed-up to 17 times faster than the most accurate baseline configuration - while simultaneously improving model accuracy.

We present YoNoSplat, a feedforward model that reconstructs high-quality 3D Gaussian Splatting representations from an arbitrary number of images. Our model is highly versatile, operating effectively with both posed and unposed, calibrated and uncalibrated inputs. YoNoSplat predicts local Gaussians and camera poses for each view, which are aggregated into a global representation using either predicted or provided poses. To overcome the inherent difficulty of jointly learning 3D Gaussians and camera parameters, we introduce a novel mixing training strategy. This approach mitigates the entanglement between the two tasks by initially using ground-truth poses to aggregate local Gaussians and gradually transitioning to a mix of predicted and ground-truth poses, which prevents both training instability and exposure bias. We further resolve the scale ambiguity problem by a novel pairwise camera-distance normalization scheme and by embedding camera intrinsics into the network. Moreover, YoNoSplat also predicts intrinsic parameters, making it feasible for uncalibrated inputs. YoNoSplat demonstrates exceptional efficiency, reconstructing a scene from 100 views (at 280x518 resolution) in just 2.69 seconds on an NVIDIA GH200 GPU. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks in both pose-free and pose-dependent settings.

A series of comprehensive experiments was carried out using the proposed dataset to assess the accuracy and overall performance of various object detection models. Specifically, we performed an in-depth evaluation of YOLOv8, YOLOv10, YOLO11m, and RT-DETR on our dataset. Among these models, YOLO11m achieved the highest accuracy of 92.39\\% in waste detection, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting waste. Additionally, it attains an mAP@50 of 0.91, highlighting its high precision.

Yet, developing downstream vision models for infrared applications is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data, due to the specialized expertise required for infrared annotation. While synthetic infrared image generation has the potential to accelerate model development by providing large-scale, diverse training data, training foundation-level generative diffusion models in the infrared domain has remained elusive due to limited datasets. In light of such data constraints, we explore an inference-time scaling approach using a domain-adapted CLIP-based verifier for enhanced infrared image generation quality. We adapt FLUX.1-dev, a state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model, to the infrared domain by finetuning it on a small sample of infrared images using parameter-efficient techniques. The trained verifier is then employed during inference to guide the diffusion sampling process toward higher quality infrared generations that better align with input text prompts. Empirically, we find that our approach leads to consistent improvements in generation quality, reducing FID scores on the KAIST Multispectral Pedestrian Detection Benchmark dataset by 10% compared to unguided baseline samples. Our results suggest that inference-time guidance offers a promising direction for bridging the domain gap in low-data infrared settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u7684CLIP\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u7ea2\u5916\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u4f4e\u80fd\u89c1\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u4e0b\u6e38\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u5408\u6210\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5728\u7ea2\u5916\u9886\u57df\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7840\u7ea7\u751f\u6210\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e00\u76f4\u5f88\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u7684CLIP\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u589e\u5f3a\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03FLUX.1-dev\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728KAIST\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u884c\u4eba\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f7fFID\u5206\u6570\u76f8\u6bd4\u65e0\u5f15\u5bfc\u57fa\u7ebf\u6837\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8610%\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u5f97\u5230\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e3a\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u7ea2\u5916\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5f25\u5408\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

While recent work highlights the role of exploration and entropy stability in improving pass@K, empirical evidence points to a paradox: RLVR and ORM/PRM typically reinforce existing tree-like reasoning paths rather than expanding the reasoning scope, raising the question of why exploration helps at all if no new patterns emerge.\n  To reconcile this paradox, we adopt the perspective of Kim et al. (2025), viewing easy (e.g., simplifying a fraction) versus hard (e.g., discovering a symmetry) reasoning steps as low- versus high-probability Markov transitions, and formalize post-training dynamics through Multi-task Tree-structured Markov Chains (TMC). In this tractable model, pretraining corresponds to tree expansion, while post-training corresponds to chain-of-thought reweighting. We show that several phenomena recently observed in empirical studies arise naturally in this setting: (1) RLVR induces a squeezing effect, reducing reasoning entropy and forgetting some correct paths; (2) population rewards of ORM/PRM encourage consistency rather than accuracy, thereby favoring common patterns; and (3) certain rare, high-uncertainty reasoning paths by the base model are responsible for solving hard problem instances.\n  Together, these explain why exploration -- even when confined to the base model's reasoning scope -- remains essential: it preserves access to rare but crucial reasoning traces needed for difficult cases, which are squeezed out by RLVR or unfavored by inference scaling. Building on this, we further show that exploration strategies such as rejecting easy instances and KL regularization help preserve rare reasoning traces. Empirical simulations corroborate our theoretical results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6811\u72b6\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u6096\u8bba\uff1a\u867d\u7136RLVR\u548cORM/PRM\u4e3b\u8981\u5f3a\u5316\u5df2\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4f46\u63a2\u7d22\u4ecd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u56f0\u96be\u95ee\u9898\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7f55\u89c1\u4f46\u5173\u952e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u6096\u8bba\uff1a\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u63a2\u7d22\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8pass@K\uff0c\u5373\u4f7fRLVR\u548cORM/PRM\u4e3b\u8981\u5f3a\u5316\u5df2\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u800c\u975e\u6269\u5c55\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6811\u72b6\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u7b80\u5355\u548c\u56f0\u96be\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4f4e\u6982\u7387\u548c\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u4e3a\u6811\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u4e3a\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff1a(1) RLVR\u4ea7\u751f\u6324\u538b\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u71b5\u5e76\u9057\u5fd8\u6b63\u786e\u8def\u5f84\uff1b(2) ORM/PRM\u9f13\u52b1\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u800c\u975e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b(3) \u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7f55\u89c1\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u8d1f\u8d23\u89e3\u51b3\u56f0\u96be\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4e4b\u6240\u4ee5\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u56f0\u96be\u95ee\u9898\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7f55\u89c1\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f1a\u88abRLVR\u6324\u538b\u6216\u88ab\u63a8\u7406\u7f29\u653e\u6240\u5ffd\u89c6\u3002\u62d2\u7edd\u7b80\u5355\u5b9e\u4f8b\u548cKL\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b49\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4fdd\u62a4\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f55\u89c1\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002"}}

While recent transformer-based approaches like TULIP show promise, they remain limited to spatial-domain processing with restricted receptive fields. We introduce FLASH (Frequency-aware LiDAR Adaptive Super-resolution with Hierarchical fusion), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations through dual-domain processing. FLASH integrates two key innovations: (i) Frequency-Aware Window Attention that combines local spatial attention with global frequency-domain analysis via FFT, capturing both fine-grained geometry and periodic scanning patterns at log-linear complexity. (ii) Adaptive Multi-Scale Fusion that replaces conventional skip connections with learned position-specific feature aggregation, enhanced by CBAM attention for dynamic feature selection. Extensive experiments on KITTI demonstrate that FLASH achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluation metrics, surpassing even uncertainty-enhanced baselines that require multiple forward passes. Notably, FLASH outperforms TULIP with Monte Carlo Dropout while maintaining single-pass efficiency, which enables real-time deployment.

Our analysis shows that, under outcome-only reward signals, reinforcement learning finetuning achieves high accuracy with polynomial sample complexity, whereas direct learning suffers from an exponential bottleneck.

Previous image-based streaming diffusion models have powered efficient and creative live streaming products but have hit limits on temporal consistency due to the foundation of image-based designs. Recent advances in video diffusion have markedly improved temporal consistency and sampling efficiency for offline generation. However, offline generation systems primarily optimize throughput by batching large workloads. In contrast, live online streaming operates under strict service-level objectives (SLOs): time-to-first-frame must be minimal, and every frame must meet a per-frame deadline with low jitter. Besides, scalable multi-GPU serving for real-time streams remains largely unresolved so far. To address this, we present StreamDiffusionV2, a training-free pipeline for interactive live streaming with video diffusion models. StreamDiffusionV2 integrates an SLO-aware batching scheduler and a block scheduler, together with a sink-token--guided rolling KV cache, a motion-aware noise controller, and other system-level optimizations. Moreover, we introduce a scalable pipeline orchestration that parallelizes the diffusion process across denoising steps and network layers, achieving near-linear FPS scaling without violating latency guarantees. The system scales seamlessly across heterogeneous GPU environments and supports flexible denoising steps (e.g., 1--4), enabling both ultra-low-latency and higher-quality modes. Without TensorRT or quantization, StreamDiffusionV2 renders the first frame within 0.5s and attains 58.28 FPS with a 14B-parameter model and 64.52 FPS with a 1.3B-parameter model on four H100 GPUs, making state-of-the-art generative live streaming practical and accessible--from individual creators to enterprise-scale platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "StreamDiffusionV2\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u89c6\u9891\u76f4\u64ad\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7SLO\u611f\u77e5\u6279\u5904\u7406\u8c03\u5ea6\u3001\u5757\u8c03\u5ea6\u3001\u6eda\u52a8KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7b49\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5e27\u7387\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u6d41\u5f0f\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u79bb\u7ebf\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u76f4\u64ad\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u76f4\u64adSLO\uff08\u670d\u52a1\u7ea7\u522b\u76ee\u6807\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u96c6\u6210SLO\u611f\u77e5\u6279\u5904\u7406\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u548c\u5757\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u91c7\u7528sink-token\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6eda\u52a8KV\u7f13\u5b58\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u566a\u58f0\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7b49\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u7f16\u6392\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u5c42\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u57284\u4e2aH100 GPU\u4e0a\uff0c14B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u523058.28 FPS\uff0c1.3B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u523064.52 FPS\uff0c\u9996\u5e27\u6e32\u67d3\u65f6\u95f4\u5c0f\u4e8e0.5\u79d2\uff0c\u652f\u63011-4\u6b65\u53bb\u566a\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "conclusion": "StreamDiffusionV2\u4f7f\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u76f4\u64ad\u53d8\u5f97\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4ece\u4e2a\u4eba\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u5230\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u5e73\u53f0\u90fd\u80fd\u53d7\u76ca\u3002"}}

A crucial question about AI reasoning is whether models can extrapolate learned reasoning patterns to solve harder tasks with longer chain-of-thought (CoT). In this work, we present a theoretical analysis of transformers learning on synthetic state-tracking tasks with gradient descent. We mathematically prove how the algebraic structure of state-tracking problems governs the degree of extrapolation of the learned CoT. Specifically, our theory characterizes the length generalization of transformers through the mechanism of attention concentration, linking the retrieval robustness of the attention layer to the state-tracking task structure of long-context reasoning.

Specifically, we first generate multiple videos of the same object with diverse motions. We then embed each motion into a latent vector and train a shared motion decoder to learn the distribution of motions represented by a structured and compact motion representation, i.e., neural key point trajectories. The canonical 3D Gaussians are then driven by these key points and fused to model the geometry and appearance. During inference time with learned latent space, we can instantly sample diverse 3D motions in a single-forward pass and support several interesting applications including 3D motion interpolation and language-guided motion generation.

Shortening these sequences typically involves costly, time-consuming experimental campaigns. Ideally, we could instead use modern models of massive databases of sequences from nature to learn how to propose shrunken proteins that resemble sequences found in nature. Unfortunately, these models struggle to efficiently search the combinatorial space of all deletions, and are not trained with inductive biases to learn how to delete. To address this gap, we propose SCISOR, a novel discrete diffusion model that deletes letters from sequences to generate protein samples that resemble those found in nature. To do so, SCISOR trains a de-noiser to reverse a forward noising process that adds random insertions to natural sequences. As a generative model, SCISOR fits evolutionary sequence data competitively with previous large models. In evaluation, SCISOR achieves state-of-the-art predictions of the functional effects of deletions on ProteinGym.

However, safety regulations and operational constraints in operating rooms (ORs) limit embodied agents from freely perceiving and interacting in realistic settings. Digital twins provide high-fidelity, risk-free environments for exploration and training. How we may create photorealistic and dynamic digital representations of ORs that capture relevant spatial, visual, and behavioral complexity remains unclear. We introduce TwinOR, a framework for constructing photorealistic, dynamic digital twins of ORs for embodied AI research. The system reconstructs static geometry from pre-scan videos and continuously models human and equipment motion through multi-view perception of OR activities. The static and dynamic components are fused into an immersive 3D environment that supports controllable simulation and embodied exploration. The proposed framework reconstructs complete OR geometry with centimeter level accuracy while preserving dynamic interaction across surgical workflows, enabling realistic renderings and a virtual playground for embodied AI systems. In our experiments, TwinOR simulates stereo and monocular sensor streams for geometry understanding and visual localization tasks. Models such as FoundationStereo and ORB-SLAM3 on TwinOR-synthesized data achieve performance within their reported accuracy on real indoor datasets, demonstrating that TwinOR provides sensor-level realism sufficient for perception and localization challenges. By establishing a real-to-sim pipeline for constructing dynamic, photorealistic digital twins of OR environments, TwinOR enables the safe, scalable, and data-efficient development and benchmarking of embodied AI, ultimately accelerating the deployment of embodied AI from sim-to-real.", "AI": {"tldr": "TwinOR\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u624b\u672f\u5ba4\u7684\u5149\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5177\u8eabAI\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u63a7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "motivation": "\u624b\u672f\u5ba4\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9650\u5236\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7ea6\u675f\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5177\u8eab\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u81ea\u7531\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u521b\u5efa\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u65e0\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u73af\u5883\u6765\u652f\u6301\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u9884\u626b\u63cf\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u9759\u6001\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u611f\u77e5\u6301\u7eed\u5efa\u6a21\u4eba\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5c06\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7ec4\u4ef6\u878d\u5408\u5230\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f3D\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u63a7\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5177\u8eab\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "result": "TwinOR\u4ee5\u5398\u7c73\u7ea7\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cd\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u624b\u672f\u5ba4\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cFoundationStereo\u548cORB-SLAM3\u6a21\u578b\u5728TwinOR\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5ba4\u5185\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u62a5\u544a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "TwinOR\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u4ece\u771f\u5b9e\u5230\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u5149\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u7684\u624b\u672f\u5ba4\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\uff0c\u4e3a\u5177\u8eabAI\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0e\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u5177\u8eabAI\u4ece\u6a21\u62df\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

A promising solution is to use cascaded inference, where small, cheap models handle easy queries, and only the hardest examples are escalated to more powerful models. However, existing cascade methods typically rely on supervised training with labeled data, offer no theoretical generalization guarantees, and provide limited control over test-time computational cost. We introduce C3PO (Cost Controlled Cascaded Prediction Optimization), a self-supervised framework for optimizing LLM cascades under probabilistic cost constraints. By focusing on minimizing regret with respect to the most powerful model (MPM), C3PO avoids the need for labeled data by constructing a cascade using only unlabeled model outputs. It leverages conformal prediction to bound the probability that inference cost exceeds a user-specified budget. We provide theoretical guarantees on both cost control and generalization error, and show that our optimization procedure is effective even with small calibration sets. Empirically, C3PO achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse set of reasoning benchmarks including GSM8K, MATH-500, BigBench-Hard and AIME, outperforming strong LLM cascading baselines in both accuracy and cost-efficiency.

However, evaluations on broad downstream tasks reveal a consistent suboptimality of the routers in existing MoE LLMs, which results in a severe performance gap (e.g., 10-20% in accuracy) to the optimal routing. In this paper, we show that aligning the manifold of routing weights with that of task embedding can effectively reduce the gap and improve MoE LLMs' generalization performance. Our method, \"Routing Manifold Alignment (RoMA)\", introduces an additional manifold regularization term in the post-training objective and only requires lightweight finetuning of routers (with other parameters frozen). Specifically, the regularization encourages the routing weights of each sample to be close to those of its successful neighbors (whose routing weights lead to correct answers) in a task embedding space. Consequently, samples targeting similar tasks will share similar expert choices across layers. Building such bindings between tasks and experts over different samples is essential to achieve better generalization. Moreover, RoMA demonstrates the advantage of unifying the task understanding (by embedding models) with solution generation (by MoE LLMs). In experiments, we finetune routers in OLMoE, DeepSeekMoE, and Qwen3-MoE using RoMA.

Often, the dependence of the solution of the ODE on additional parameters is of interest, e.g.\\ when dealing with uncertainty quantification or design optimization. Directly studying this dependence can quickly become too computationally expensive, such that cheaper surrogate models approximating the solution are of interest. One popular class of surrogate models are Gaussian processes (GPs). They perform well when approximating stationary functions, functions which have a similar level of variation along any given parameter direction, however solutions to stiff ODEs are often characterized by a mixture of regions of rapid and slow variation along the time axis and when dealing with such nonstationary functions, GP performance frequently degrades drastically. We therefore aim to reparameterize stiff ODE solutions based on the available data, to make them appear more stationary and hence recover good GP performance. This approach comes with minimal computational overhead and requires no internal changes to the GP implementation, as it can be seen as a separate preprocessing step. We illustrate the achieved benefits using multiple examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u521a\u6027\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u89e3\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u66f4\u5e73\u7a33\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u521a\u6027\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u89e3\u901a\u5e38\u5305\u542b\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u7f13\u6162\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u7279\u6027\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u76f4\u63a5\u7814\u7a76\u53c2\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u7528\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u521a\u6027ODE\u89e3\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u5e73\u7a33\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4e2a\u793a\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u521a\u6027ODE\u89e3\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}
