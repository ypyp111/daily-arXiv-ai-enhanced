TL;DR: 这篇论文是关于3D和4D世界建模的首次系统性综述，提出了明确的定义和分类体系，填补了现有研究在标准化定义和3D/4D表示方面的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有世界建模研究主要关注2D图像和视频生成方法，忽视了快速发展的3D和4D表示（如RGB-D图像、占据网格、LiDAR点云），且缺乏标准化的定义和分类体系，导致文献中的主张碎片化且不一致。

Method: 建立了精确的定义体系，引入了结构化分类法（视频生成VideoGen、占据生成OccGen、LiDAR生成LiDARGen），系统总结了针对3D/4D设置的数据集和评估指标。

Result: 提供了首个专门针对3D和4D世界建模与生成的全面综述，为领域发展提供了连贯的基础性参考框架。

Conclusion: 该综述填补了3D/4D世界建模领域的标准化空白，为后续研究提供了清晰的分类体系和评估基准，有助于推动该领域的系统化发展。

Abstract: World modeling has become a cornerstone in AI research, enabling agents to
understand, represent, and predict the dynamic environments they inhabit. While
prior work largely emphasizes generative methods for 2D image and video data,
they overlook the rapidly growing body of work that leverages native 3D and 4D
representations such as RGB-D imagery, occupancy grids, and LiDAR point clouds
for large-scale scene modeling. At the same time, the absence of a standardized
definition and taxonomy for ``world models'' has led to fragmented and
sometimes inconsistent claims in the literature. This survey addresses these
gaps by presenting the first comprehensive review explicitly dedicated to 3D
and 4D world modeling and generation. We establish precise definitions,
introduce a structured taxonomy spanning video-based (VideoGen),
occupancy-based (OccGen), and LiDAR-based (LiDARGen) approaches, and
systematically summarize datasets and evaluation metrics tailored to 3D/4D
settings. We further discuss practical applications, identify open challenges,
and highlight promising research directions, aiming to provide a coherent and
foundational reference for advancing the field. A systematic summary of
existing literature is available at https://github.com/worldbench/survey

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XFloodNet是一个基于深度学习的城市洪水分类框架，通过多模态特征融合和注意力机制，在三个基准数据集上取得了最先进的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统洪水检测方法依赖单模态数据和静态规则系统，无法捕捉洪水事件的动态非线性关系，现有注意力机制和集成学习方法在层次细化、跨模态特征集成和对噪声环境的适应性方面存在局限。

Method: XFloodNet包含三个核心组件：1）分层跨模态门控注意力机制，动态对齐视觉和文本特征；2）异构卷积自适应多尺度注意力模块，提取和优先处理判别性洪水特征；3）级联卷积变换器特征细化技术，通过自适应缩放和级联操作协调分层特征。

Result: 在Chennai Floods、Rhine18 Floods和Harz17 Floods三个基准数据集上分别取得了93.33%、82.24%和88.60%的F1分数，显著超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: XFloodNet通过创新的深度学习技术重新定义了城市洪水分类，为动态、非线性的洪水事件提供了更准确和鲁棒的检测解决方案。

Abstract: In an era of escalating climate change, urban flooding has emerged as a
critical challenge for sustainable cities, threatening lives, infrastructure,
and ecosystems. Traditional flood detection methods are constrained by their
reliance on unimodal data and static rule-based systems, which fail to capture
the dynamic, non-linear relationships inherent in flood events. Furthermore,
existing attention mechanisms and ensemble learning approaches exhibit
limitations in hierarchical refinement, cross-modal feature integration, and
adaptability to noisy or unstructured environments, resulting in suboptimal
flood classification performance. To address these challenges, we present
XFloodNet, a novel framework that redefines urban flood classification through
advanced deep-learning techniques. XFloodNet integrates three novel components:
(1) a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Gated Attention mechanism that dynamically
aligns visual and textual features, enabling precise multi-granularity
interactions and resolving contextual ambiguities; (2) a Heterogeneous
Convolutional Adaptive Multi-Scale Attention module, which leverages
frequency-enhanced channel attention and frequency-modulated spatial attention
to extract and prioritize discriminative flood-related features across spectral
and spatial domains; and (3) a Cascading Convolutional Transformer Feature
Refinement technique that harmonizes hierarchical features through adaptive
scaling and cascading operations, ensuring robust and noise-resistant flood
detection. We evaluate our proposed method on three benchmark datasets, such as
Chennai Floods, Rhine18 Floods, and Harz17 Floods, XFloodNet achieves
state-of-the-art F1-scores of 93.33%, 82.24%, and 88.60%, respectively,
surpassing existing methods by significant margins.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video Parallel Scaling (VPS) 是一种推理时方法，通过并行处理视频帧子集来扩展视频大语言模型的感知带宽，避免长上下文带来的计算成本问题，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频大语言模型在处理更多输入帧以捕获细粒度时间细节时，面临计算成本过高和长上下文性能下降的瓶颈。

Method: VPS 运行多个并行推理流，每个流处理视频帧的不同不相交子集，然后聚合这些互补流的输出概率来整合更丰富的视觉信息。

Result: 在多个模型架构和规模（2B-32B）上的实验表明，VPS 在 Video-MME 和 EventHallusion 等基准测试中持续显著提升性能，比其他并行方法扩展性更好。

Conclusion: VPS 提供了一种内存高效且鲁棒的框架，无需额外训练即可增强视频大语言模型的时间推理能力，是对其他解码策略的补充。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) face a critical bottleneck:
increasing the number of input frames to capture fine-grained temporal detail
leads to prohibitive computational costs and performance degradation from long
context lengths. We introduce Video Parallel Scaling (VPS), an inference-time
method that expands a model's perceptual bandwidth without increasing its
context window. VPS operates by running multiple parallel inference streams,
each processing a unique, disjoint subset of the video's frames. By aggregating
the output probabilities from these complementary streams, VPS integrates a
richer set of visual information than is possible with a single pass. We
theoretically show that this approach effectively contracts the Chinchilla
scaling law by leveraging uncorrelated visual evidence, thereby improving
performance without additional training. Extensive experiments across various
model architectures and scales (2B-32B) on benchmarks such as Video-MME and
EventHallusion demonstrate that VPS consistently and significantly improves
performance. It scales more favorably than other parallel alternatives (e.g.
Self-consistency) and is complementary to other decoding strategies, offering a
memory-efficient and robust framework for enhancing the temporal reasoning
capabilities of VideoLLMs.

TL;DR: 多模态立场检测框架，通过大语言模型和图片描述生成器处理文本和图像信息，使用专门的transformer模块进行融合，在MultiClimate数据集上超越现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有立场检测方法主要关注文本数据，而实际社交媒体内容日益结合文本和视觉元素，需要先进的多模态方法

Method: 使用大语言模型从源文本中提取立场相关摘要，基于领域知识的图片描述生成器解释视觉内容，通过专门的transformer模块共同建模文本和图像的交互关系

Result: 在MultiClimate数据集上达到准确率76.2%，精度76.3%，召回率76.2%，F1分数76.2%，超越了现有最先进方法

Conclusion: 该多模态立场检测框架通过层次融合文本和视觉信息，能够实现更稳健的立场分类，为社交媒体分析提供了有效的多模态解决方案

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of information across digital platforms, stance
detection has emerged as a pivotal challenge in social media analysis. While
most of the existing approaches focus solely on textual data, real-world social
media content increasingly combines text with visual elements creating a need
for advanced multimodal methods. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal
stance detection framework that integrates textual and visual information
through a hierarchical fusion approach. Our method first employs a Large
Language Model to retrieve stance-relevant summaries from source text, while a
domain-aware image caption generator interprets visual content in the context
of the target topic. These modalities are then jointly modeled along with the
reply text, through a specialized transformer module that captures interactions
between the texts and images. The proposed modality fusion framework integrates
diverse modalities to facilitate robust stance classification. We evaluate our
approach on the MultiClimate dataset, a benchmark for climate change-related
stance detection containing aligned video frames and transcripts. We achieve
accuracy of 76.2%, precision of 76.3%, recall of 76.2% and F1-score of 76.2%,
respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Na\"ive Bayes), resulting in 15 different base learners. These are aggregated
via weighted averaging to classify regions as Car, Van, Truck, Bus, or
background. Hyperparameters are optimized with the whale optimization algorithm
to balance accuracy, precision, and recall. Implemented in MATLAB R2020b with
parallel processing, SI-EDTL outperforms existing methods on the AU-AIR UAV
dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提供了一个新的火星数字高程模型预测数据集MCTED，包含80,898个样本，并证明专门训练的小型U-Net模型在高程预测任务上超过了零样本性能的DepthAnythingV2基础模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决火星大规模DEM处理流程中存在的人工故障和数据缺失问题，为机器学习应用提供高质量的火星地形数据集

Method: 使用火星重追踪过大器CTX仪器收集的高分辨率正弄图像和DEM数据对，通过综合处理流程生成80,898个样本，包含光学图像补丁、DEM补丁和两个掩码补丁

Result: 生成了覆盖火星表面的多样化数据集，并进行了统计分析，包括样本空间分布、高程值分布、坡度等。小型U-Net模型在该数据集上的表现超过了DepthAnythingV2的零样本性能

Conclusion: MCTED数据集为火星地形分析提供了高质量的机器学习资源，专门训练的模型即使很小也能在特定任务上超过基础模型，所有数据和代码已开源提供

Abstract: This work presents a new dataset for the Martian digital elevation model
prediction task, ready for machine learning applications called MCTED. The
dataset has been generated using a comprehensive pipeline designed to process
high-resolution Mars orthoimage and DEM pairs from Day et al., yielding a
dataset consisting of 80,898 data samples. The source images are data gathered
by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter using the CTX instrument, providing a very
diverse and comprehensive coverage of the Martian surface. Given the complexity
of the processing pipelines used in large-scale DEMs, there are often artefacts
and missing data points in the original data, for which we developed tools to
solve or mitigate their impact. We divide the processed samples into training
and validation splits, ensuring samples in both splits cover no mutual areas to
avoid data leakage. Every sample in the dataset is represented by the optical
image patch, DEM patch, and two mask patches, indicating values that were
originally missing or were altered by us. This allows future users of the
dataset to handle altered elevation regions as they please. We provide
statistical insights of the generated dataset, including the spatial
distribution of samples, the distributions of elevation values, slopes and
more. Finally, we train a small U-Net architecture on the MCTED dataset and
compare its performance to a monocular depth estimation foundation model,
DepthAnythingV2, on the task of elevation prediction. We find that even a very
small architecture trained on this dataset specifically, beats a zero-shot
performance of a depth estimation foundation model like DepthAnythingV2. We
make the dataset and code used for its generation completely open source in
public repositories.

### [7] [APML: Adaptive Probabilistic Matching Loss for Robust 3D Point Cloud Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08104)
*Sasan Sharifipour,Constantino Álvarez Casado,Mohammad Sabokrou,Miguel Bordallo López*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了自适应概率匹配损失（APML），一种完全可微分的一对一匹配近似方法，通过Sinkhorn迭代和温度缩放相似度矩阵来解决传统点云损失函数的多对一对应问题，具有近二次时间复杂度，在多个任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统点云预测任务的损失函数（如CD、HyperCD、InfoCD）存在多对一对应问题，导致密集区域点拥堵和稀疏区域覆盖不足，且包含不可微操作。EMD虽然能强制一对一对应但计算复杂度高。

Method: 使用Sinkhorn迭代在温度缩放的相似度矩阵上进行概率匹配，通过分析计算温度来保证最小分配概率，避免手动调参，实现完全可微分和近二次时间复杂度。

Result: 在ShapeNet基准测试和从WiFi CSI生成3D人体点云的时空Transformer上，APML损失实现了更快收敛、更好的空间分布（特别是在低密度区域），以及改进或相当的定量性能。

Conclusion: APML损失提供了一种高效且可微分的替代方案，解决了传统点云损失函数的局限性，在多个应用场景中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Training deep learning models for point cloud prediction tasks such as shape
completion and generation depends critically on loss functions that measure
discrepancies between predicted and ground-truth point sets. Commonly used
functions such as Chamfer Distance (CD), HyperCD, and InfoCD rely on
nearest-neighbor assignments, which often induce many-to-one correspondences,
leading to point congestion in dense regions and poor coverage in sparse
regions. These losses also involve non-differentiable operations due to index
selection, which may affect gradient-based optimization. Earth Mover Distance
(EMD) enforces one-to-one correspondences and captures structural similarity
more effectively, but its cubic computational complexity limits its practical
use. We propose the Adaptive Probabilistic Matching Loss (APML), a fully
differentiable approximation of one-to-one matching that leverages Sinkhorn
iterations on a temperature-scaled similarity matrix derived from pairwise
distances. We analytically compute the temperature to guarantee a minimum
assignment probability, eliminating manual tuning. APML achieves near-quadratic
runtime, comparable to Chamfer-based losses, and avoids non-differentiable
operations. When integrated into state-of-the-art architectures (PoinTr, PCN,
FoldingNet) on ShapeNet benchmarks and on a spatiotemporal Transformer (CSI2PC)
that generates 3D human point clouds from WiFi CSI measurements, APM loss
yields faster convergence, superior spatial distribution, especially in
low-density regions, and improved or on-par quantitative performance without
additional hyperparameter search. The code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于RPCA的轻量级红外小目标检测框架L-RPCANet，通过分层瓶颈结构和噪声抑制模块实现参数轻量化和噪声鲁棒性提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度展开网络在红外小目标检测中存在参数不够轻量和噪声鲁棒性不足的问题，需要开发更高效且稳健的检测方法

Method: 构建分层瓶颈结构进行通道维度调整和特征精炼，嵌入噪声抑制模块增强抗噪能力，采用SENet通道注意力机制关注不同特征重要性

Result: 在ISTD数据集上的大量实验验证了该方法相比RPCANet、DRPCANet和RPCANet++等先进方法的优越性

Conclusion: L-RPCANet在保持轻量化和鲁棒性的同时实现了优异的性能，为红外小目标检测提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) is one of the key techniques in image
processing. Although deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have demonstrated promising
performance in ISTD due to their model interpretability and data adaptability,
existing methods still face significant challenges in parameter lightweightness
and noise robustness. In this regard, we propose a highly lightweight framework
based on robust principal component analysis (RPCA) called L-RPCANet.
Technically, a hierarchical bottleneck structure is constructed to reduce and
increase the channel dimension in the single-channel input infrared image to
achieve channel-wise feature refinement, with bottleneck layers designed in
each module to extract features. This reduces the number of channels in feature
extraction and improves the lightweightness of network parameters. Furthermore,
a noise reduction module is embedded to enhance the robustness against complex
noise. In addition, squeeze-and-excitation networks (SENets) are leveraged as a
channel attention mechanism to focus on the varying importance of different
features across channels, thereby achieving excellent performance while
maintaining both lightweightness and robustness. Extensive experiments on the
ISTD datasets validate the superiority of our proposed method compared with
state-of-the-art methods covering RPCANet, DRPCANet, and RPCANet++. The code
will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/L-RPCANet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过超稀疇采样策略（USS）和BSTFormer模型，大幅降低视频摄像的电力消耗，实现高并发性和高动态范围的视频恢复


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高分辨率高帧率摄像器电力消耗过高的问题，通过物理层压缩测量技术降低每像素的能耗

Method: 提出超稀疇采样策略（USS），在每个空间位置只设置一个子帧为1，其他为0，并构建BSTFormer模型，利用局部块注意力、全局稀疇注意力和时序注意力来处理USS测量数据

Result: 在模拟和实际数据上，方法显著超过了所有现有最优算法，并具有比随机采样策略更高的动态范围

Conclusion: USS策略是实现芯片级视频SCI系统的良好选择，具有固定曝光时间、高动态范围和低能耗的优势

Abstract: Digital cameras consume ~0.1 microjoule per pixel to capture and encode
video, resulting in a power usage of ~20W for a 4K sensor operating at 30 fps.
Imagining gigapixel cameras operating at 100-1000 fps, the current processing
model is unsustainable. To address this, physical layer compressive measurement
has been proposed to reduce power consumption per pixel by 10-100X. Video
Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) introduces high frequency modulation in the
optical sensor layer to increase effective frame rate. A commonly used sampling
strategy of video SCI is Random Sampling (RS) where each mask element value is
randomly set to be 0 or 1. Similarly, image inpainting (I2P) has demonstrated
that images can be recovered from a fraction of the image pixels. Inspired by
I2P, we propose Ultra-Sparse Sampling (USS) regime, where at each spatial
location, only one sub-frame is set to 1 and all others are set to 0. We then
build a Digital Micro-mirror Device (DMD) encoding system to verify the
effectiveness of our USS strategy. Ideally, we can decompose the USS
measurement into sub-measurements for which we can utilize I2P algorithms to
recover high-speed frames. However, due to the mismatch between the DMD and
CCD, the USS measurement cannot be perfectly decomposed. To this end, we
propose BSTFormer, a sparse TransFormer that utilizes local Block attention,
global Sparse attention, and global Temporal attention to exploit the sparsity
of the USS measurement. Extensive results on both simulated and real-world data
show that our method significantly outperforms all previous state-of-the-art
algorithms. Additionally, an essential advantage of the USS strategy is its
higher dynamic range than that of the RS strategy. Finally, from the
application perspective, the USS strategy is a good choice to implement a
complete video SCI system on chip due to its fixed exposure time.

Method: 使用GTA5游戏构建致命暴力数据集，包含多视角CCTV视频；提出基于Wasserstein对抗训练的片段级域适应策略，弥合合成数据与真实数据特征差距

Result: 实验验证了GTA-Crime数据集的有效性，结合域适应策略能够持续提升真实世界致命暴力检测准确率

Conclusion: GTA-Crime为解决致命暴力检测的数据稀缺问题提供了有效解决方案，数据集和生成框架已公开

Abstract: Recent advancements in video anomaly detection (VAD) have enabled
identification of various criminal activities in surveillance videos, but
detecting fatal incidents such as shootings and stabbings remains difficult due
to their rarity and ethical issues in data collection. Recognizing this
limitation, we introduce GTA-Crime, a fatal video anomaly dataset and
generation framework using Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA5). Our dataset contains
fatal situations such as shootings and stabbings, captured from CCTV multiview
perspectives under diverse conditions including action types, weather, time of
day, and viewpoints. To address the rarity of such scenarios, we also release a
framework for generating these types of videos. Additionally, we propose a
snippet-level domain adaptation strategy using Wasserstein adversarial training
to bridge the gap between synthetic GTA-Crime features and real-world features
like UCF-Crime. Experimental results validate our GTA-Crime dataset and
demonstrate that incorporating GTA-Crime with our domain adaptation strategy
consistently enhances real world fatal violence detection accuracy. Our dataset
and the data generation framework are publicly available at

Motivation: 解决ViT架构预训练在自然图像上且需要三通道输入，而胸部X光扫描本质上是灰度单通道图像的不匹配问题

Method: 采用通道复制策略，将单通道CXR图像转换为ViT兼容格式，避免引入额外信息损失

Conclusion: 简单有效的通道复制策略能让ViT在灰度医学影像任务中充分发挥表征能力，具有实际临床部署潜力

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging remains one of the most widely used diagnostic
tools for detecting pulmonary diseases such as tuberculosis (TB) and pneumonia.
Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Vision Transformers (ViTs), have
shown strong potential for automated medical image analysis. However, most ViT
architectures are pretrained on natural images and require three-channel
inputs, while CXR scans are inherently grayscale. To address this gap, we
propose RepViT-CXR, a channel replication strategy that adapts single-channel
CXR images into a ViT-compatible format without introducing additional
information loss. We evaluate RepViT-CXR on three benchmark datasets. On the
TB-CXR dataset,our method achieved an accuracy of 99.9% and an AUC of 99.9%,
surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods such as Topo-CXR (99.3% accuracy,
99.8% AUC). For the Pediatric Pneumonia dataset, RepViT-CXR obtained 99.0%
accuracy, with 99.2% recall, 99.3% precision, and an AUC of 99.0%,
outperforming strong baselines including DCNN and VGG16. On the Shenzhen TB
dataset, our approach achieved 91.1% accuracy and an AUC of 91.2%, marking a
performance improvement over previously reported CNN-based methods. These
results demonstrate that a simple yet effective channel replication strategy
allows ViTs to fully leverage their representational power on grayscale medical
imaging tasks. RepViT-CXR establishes a new state of the art for TB and
pneumonia detection from chest X-rays, showing strong potential for deployment
in real-world clinical screening systems.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效捕捉AD引起的脑部不对称病理特征，提高了诊断性能并具有良好的可解释性。

Abstract: Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) combined with deep learning has
achieved remarkable progress in the prediction and diagnosis of Alzheimer's
disease (AD). Existing studies have used CNN and transformer to build a
well-performing network, but most of them are based on pretraining or ignoring
the asymmetrical character caused by brain disorders. We propose an end-to-end
network for the detection of disease-based asymmetric induced by left and right
brain atrophy which consist of 3D CNN Encoder and Symmetry Interactive
Transformer (SIT). Following the inter-equal grid block fetch operation, the
corresponding left and right hemisphere features are aligned and subsequently
fed into the SIT for diagnostic analysis. SIT can help the model focus more on
the regions of asymmetry caused by structural changes, thus improving
diagnostic performance. We evaluated our method based on the ADNI dataset, and
the results show that the method achieves better diagnostic accuracy (92.5\%)
compared to several CNN methods and CNNs combined with a general transformer.
The visualization results show that our network pays more attention in regions
of brain atrophy, especially for the asymmetric pathological characteristics
induced by AD, demonstrating the interpretability and effectiveness of the
method.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在视频去模糊和插值任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EVDI++是一个有效的统一框架，能够利用事件相机数据实现高质量的视频去模糊和插值，在真实场景中具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Frame-based cameras with extended exposure times often produce perceptible
visual blurring and information loss between frames, significantly degrading
video quality. To address this challenge, we introduce EVDI++, a unified
self-supervised framework for Event-based Video Deblurring and Interpolation
that leverages the high temporal resolution of event cameras to mitigate motion
blur and enable intermediate frame prediction. Specifically, the Learnable
Double Integral (LDI) network is designed to estimate the mapping relation
between reference frames and sharp latent images. Then, we refine the coarse
results and optimize overall training efficiency by introducing a
learning-based division reconstruction module, enabling images to be converted
with varying exposure intervals. We devise an adaptive parameter-free fusion
strategy to obtain the final results, utilizing the confidence embedded in the
LDI outputs of concurrent events. A self-supervised learning framework is
proposed to enable network training with real-world blurry videos and events by
exploring the mutual constraints among blurry frames, latent images, and event
streams. We further construct a dataset with real-world blurry images and
events using a DAVIS346c camera, demonstrating the generalizability of the
proposed EVDI++ in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in video deblurring and interpolation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高光谱跟踪器无法有效捕捉固有光谱信息、时间依赖性和跨深度交互，需要新的方法来充分利用高光谱数据的丰富信息

Method: 提出HyMamba网络，包含光谱状态集成(SSI)模块和高光谱Mamba(HSM)模块，通过三个方向扫描SSM同步学习空间和光谱信息，构建假彩色和高光谱输入的联合特征

Result: 在HOTC2020数据集上达到73.0%的AUC分数和96.3%的DP@20分数，在7个基准数据集上实现最先进性能

Conclusion: HyMamba通过统一的光谱、跨深度和时间建模，有效解决了高光谱目标跟踪中的关键挑战，展现了卓越的性能

Abstract: Hyperspectral object tracking holds great promise due to the rich spectral
information and fine-grained material distinctions in hyperspectral images,
which are beneficial in challenging scenarios. While existing hyperspectral
trackers have made progress by either transforming hyperspectral data into
false-color images or incorporating modality fusion strategies, they often fail
to capture the intrinsic spectral information, temporal dependencies, and
cross-depth interactions. To address these limitations, a new hyperspectral
object tracking network equipped with Mamba (HyMamba), is proposed. It unifies
spectral, cross-depth, and temporal modeling through state space modules
(SSMs). The core of HyMamba lies in the Spectral State Integration (SSI)
module, which enables progressive refinement and propagation of spectral
features with cross-depth and temporal spectral information. Embedded within
each SSI, the Hyperspectral Mamba (HSM) module is introduced to learn spatial
and spectral information synchronously via three directional scanning SSMs.
Based on SSI and HSM, HyMamba constructs joint features from false-color and
hyperspectral inputs, and enhances them through interaction with original
spectral features extracted from raw hyperspectral images. Extensive
experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyMamba
achieves state-of-the-art performance. For instance, it achieves 73.0\% of the
AUC score and 96.3\% of the DP@20 score on the HOTC2020 dataset. The code will
be released at https://github.com/lgao001/HyMamba.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型在处理需要关注图像特定细节的精确问题时，为何会表现出性能差异，并系统分析输入数据特征对模型行为的影响。

Method: 建立多维检测框架，分析图像和提示词特征对模型性能的影响，使用开源VLMs研究注意力值随输入参数（如图像大小、物体数量、背景颜色、提示词特异性）的变化。

Result: 即使图像特征和提示词特异性的微小修改，也会导致VLM答案生成方式和整体性能的显著变化。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型在处理精确视觉问题时存在明显的偏见依赖问题，需要开发更好的方法来表征和改善这种变化行为。

Abstract: Recent research on Vision Language Models (VLMs) suggests that they rely on
inherent biases learned during training to respond to questions about visual
properties of an image. These biases are exacerbated when VLMs are asked highly
specific questions that require focusing on specific areas of the image. For
example, a VLM tasked with counting stars on a modified American flag (e.g.,
with more than 50 stars) will often disregard the visual evidence and fail to
answer accurately. We build upon this research and develop a multi-dimensional
examination framework to systematically determine which characteristics of the
input data, including both the image and the accompanying prompt, lead to such
differences in performance. Using open-source VLMs, we further examine how
attention values fluctuate with varying input parameters (e.g., image size,
number of objects in the image, background color, prompt specificity). This
research aims to learn how the behavior of vision language models changes and
to explore methods for characterizing such changes. Our results suggest, among
other things, that even minor modifications in image characteristics and prompt
specificity can lead to large changes in how a VLM formulates its answer and,
subsequently, its overall performance.

Conclusion: E3DPC-GZSL通过不确定性估计和语义空间优化有效解决了3D点云零样本分割中的预测偏差问题，无需为已见和未见数据使用单独分类器。

Abstract: Generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds aims to
classify each point into both seen and unseen classes. A significant challenge
with these models is their tendency to make biased predictions, often favoring
the classes encountered during training. This problem is more pronounced in 3D
applications, where the scale of the training data is typically smaller than in
image-based tasks. To address this problem, we propose a novel method called
E3DPC-GZSL, which reduces overconfident predictions towards seen classes
without relying on separate classifiers for seen and unseen data. E3DPC-GZSL
tackles the overconfidence problem by integrating an evidence-based uncertainty
estimator into a classifier. This estimator is then used to adjust prediction
probabilities using a dynamic calibrated stacking factor that accounts for
pointwise prediction uncertainty. In addition, E3DPC-GZSL introduces a novel
training strategy that improves uncertainty estimation by refining the semantic
space. This is achieved by merging learnable parameters with text-derived
features, thereby improving model optimization for unseen data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation datasets, including
ScanNet v2 and S3DIS.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的弱监督物体检测框架DTH-CP，通过热力图导向建议选择算法、基础检测网络和负确定性监督损失，解决了现有方法的三大问题，在PASCAL VOC数据集上达到了独创性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决弱监督物体检测中的三个关键问题：1)伪真实标签框要么只覆盖区别性部位要么无法区分相邻同类实例；2)WSDDN网络缺乏背景类表征且分支间语义间隔大；3)忽略建议在优化中被丢弃导致收敛慢。

Method: 设计了热力图导向建议选择器(HGPS)算法，通过双阈值预选建议；提出弱监督基础检测网络(WSBDN)，为每个建议增加背景类表征并使用热力图进行预监督；引入负确定性监督损失来加速收敛。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC 2007和2012数据集上分别达到了58.5%/81.8%和55.6%/80.5%的mAP/mCorLoc分数，表现超过了当前最先进的弱监督物体检测方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过HGPS算法、WSBDN网络和负确定性监督损失，有效解决了弱监督物体检测中的关键挑战，在标准数据集上实现了独创性能。

Abstract: Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) has attracted significant attention
in recent years, as it does not require box-level annotations. State-of-the-art
methods generally adopt a multi-module network, which employs WSDDN as the
multiple instance detection network module and multiple instance refinement
modules to refine performance. However, these approaches suffer from three key
limitations. First, existing methods tend to generate pseudo GT boxes that
either focus only on discriminative parts, failing to capture the whole object,
or cover the entire object but fail to distinguish between adjacent intra-class
instances. Second, the foundational WSDDN architecture lacks a crucial
background class representation for each proposal and exhibits a large semantic
gap between its branches. Third, prior methods discard ignored proposals during
optimization, leading to slow convergence. To address these challenges, we
first design a heatmap-guided proposal selector (HGPS) algorithm, which
utilizes dual thresholds on heatmaps to pre-select proposals, enabling pseudo
GT boxes to both capture the full object extent and distinguish between
adjacent intra-class instances. We then present a weakly supervised basic
detection network (WSBDN), which augments each proposal with a background class
representation and uses heatmaps for pre-supervision to bridge the semantic gap
between matrices. At last, we introduce a negative certainty supervision loss
on ignored proposals to accelerate convergence. Extensive experiments on the
challenging PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our framework. We achieve mAP/mCorLoc scores of 58.5%/81.8% on VOC 2007 and
55.6%/80.5% on VOC 2012, performing favorably against the state-of-the-art WSOD
methods. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: Oil palm cultivation remains one of the leading causes of deforestation in
Indonesia. To better track and address this challenge, detailed and reliable
mapping is needed to support sustainability efforts and emerging regulatory
frameworks. We present an open-access geospatial dataset of oil palm
plantations and related land cover types in Indonesia, produced through expert
labeling of high-resolution satellite imagery from 2020 to 2024. The dataset
provides polygon-based, wall-to-wall annotations across a range of
agro-ecological zones and includes a hierarchical typology that distinguishes
oil palm planting stages as well as similar perennial crops. Quality was
ensured through multi-interpreter consensus and field validation. The dataset
was created using wall-to-wall digitization over large grids, making it
suitable for training and benchmarking both conventional convolutional neural
networks and newer geospatial foundation models. Released under a CC-BY
license, it fills a key gap in training data for remote sensing and aims to
improve the accuracy of land cover types mapping. By supporting transparent
monitoring of oil palm expansion, the resource contributes to global
deforestation reduction goals and follows FAIR data principles.

Abstract: Medical vision-language pre-training shows great potential in learning
representative features from massive paired radiographs and reports. However,
in computed tomography (CT) scans, the distribution of lesions which contain
intricate structures is characterized by spatial sparsity. Besides, the complex
and implicit relationships between different pathological descriptions in each
sentence of the report and their corresponding sub-regions in radiographs pose
additional challenges. In this paper, we propose a Similarity-Driven
Cross-Granularity Pre-training (SimCroP) framework on chest CTs, which combines
similarity-driven alignment and cross-granularity fusion to improve radiograph
interpretation. We first leverage multi-modal masked modeling to optimize the
encoder for understanding precise low-level semantics from radiographs. Then,
similarity-driven alignment is designed to pre-train the encoder to adaptively
select and align the correct patches corresponding to each sentence in reports.
The cross-granularity fusion module integrates multimodal information across
instance level and word-patch level, which helps the model better capture key
pathology structures in sparse radiographs, resulting in improved performance
for multi-scale downstream tasks. SimCroP is pre-trained on a large-scale
paired CT-reports dataset and validated on image classification and
segmentation tasks across five public datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that SimCroP outperforms both cutting-edge medical self-supervised
learning methods and medical vision-language pre-training methods. Codes and
models are available at https://github.com/ToniChopp/SimCroP.

Motivation: 解决早期退出策略中存在的协方差偏移问题，即下游分支在训练时处理全部样本，而在推理时只处理难样本，导致效率-准确率交换关系受限

Method: 提出BTS-EE序列训练方案，逐个训练和校准分支，使分支训练与推理时数据分布对齐；设计基于1D卷积的轻量分支结构；提出类别精度边际(CPM)校准方法支持按类调整阈值

Result: 在CINIC-10数据集和ResNet18背榜上，BTS-EE在64种配置中均显著超过非增强训练，实现计算量减少45%，准确率仅下降2%

Conclusion: BTS-EE扩大了CNN在实时图像处理系统中的部署设计空间，为工业检测、嵌入式视觉、无人机监控等应用提供了实用的效率提升

Abstract: Real-time image classification on resource-constrained platforms demands
inference methods that balance accuracy with strict latency and power budgets.
Early-exit strategies address this need by attaching auxiliary classifiers to
intermediate layers of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), allowing "easy"
samples to terminate inference early. However, conventional training of early
exits introduces a covariance shift: downstream branches are trained on full
datasets, while at inference they process only the harder, non-exited samples.
This mismatch limits efficiency--accuracy trade-offs in practice. We introduce
the Boosted Training Scheme for Early Exits (BTS-EE), a sequential training
approach that aligns branch training with inference-time data distributions.
Each branch is trained and calibrated before the next, ensuring robustness
under selective inference conditions. To further support embedded deployment,
we propose a lightweight branch architecture based on 1D convolutions and a
Class Precision Margin (CPM) calibration method that enables per-class
threshold tuning for reliable exit decisions. Experiments on the CINIC-10
dataset with a ResNet18 backbone demonstrate that BTS-EE consistently
outperforms non-boosted training across 64 configurations, achieving up to 45
percent reduction in computation with only 2 percent accuracy degradation.
These results expand the design space for deploying CNNs in real-time image
processing systems, offering practical efficiency gains for applications such
as industrial inspection, embedded vision, and UAV-based monitoring.

Abstract: Accurate and early diagnosis of malignant melanoma is critical for improving
patient outcomes. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise
in dermoscopic image analysis, they often neglect clinical metadata and require
extensive preprocessing. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a multimodal
alternative but struggle to capture clinical specificity when trained on
general-domain data. To address this, we propose a retrieval-augmented VLM
framework that incorporates semantically similar patient cases into the
diagnostic prompt. Our method enables informed predictions without fine-tuning
and significantly improves classification accuracy and error correction over
conventional baselines. These results demonstrate that retrieval-augmented
prompting provides a robust strategy for clinical decision support.

Abstract: Three-dimensional Object Detection from multi-view cameras and LiDAR is a

Abstract: We propose a novel and general framework to disentangle video data into its
dynamic motion and static content components. Our proposed method is a
self-supervised pipeline with less assumptions and inductive biases than
previous works: it utilizes a transformer-based architecture to jointly
generate flexible implicit features for frame-wise motion and clip-wise
content, and incorporates a low-bitrate vector quantization as an information
bottleneck to promote disentanglement and form a meaningful discrete motion
space. The bitrate-controlled latent motion and content are used as conditional
inputs to a denoising diffusion model to facilitate self-supervised
representation learning. We validate our disentangled representation learning
framework on real-world talking head videos with motion transfer and
auto-regressive motion generation tasks. Furthermore, we also show that our
method can generalize to other types of video data, such as pixel sprites of 2D
cartoon characters. Our work presents a new perspective on self-supervised
learning of disentangled video representations, contributing to the broader
field of video analysis and generation.

Abstract: Vision-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction is a critical task in 3D vision
that integrates volumetric 3D reconstruction with semantic understanding.
Existing methods, however, often rely on modular pipelines. These modules are
typically optimized independently or use pre-configured inputs, leading to
cascading errors. In this paper, we address this limitation by designing a
novel causal loss that enables holistic, end-to-end supervision of the modular
2D-to-3D transformation pipeline. Grounded in the principle of 2D-to-3D
semantic causality, this loss regulates the gradient flow from 3D voxel
representations back to the 2D features. Consequently, it renders the entire
pipeline differentiable, unifying the learning process and making previously
non-trainable components fully learnable. Building on this principle, we
propose the Semantic Causality-Aware 2D-to-3D Transformation, which comprises
three components guided by our causal loss: Channel-Grouped Lifting for
adaptive semantic mapping, Learnable Camera Offsets for enhanced robustness
against camera perturbations, and Normalized Convolution for effective feature
propagation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Occ3D benchmark, demonstrating significant
robustness to camera perturbations and improved 2D-to-3D semantic consistency.

Conclusion: VRAE架构通过竖向残差连接和输入相关特征注入，有效提升了恼劣条件下车牌图像的恢复质量，为实时交通监控应用提供了高效的图像增强方案。

Abstract: In real-world traffic surveillance, vehicle images captured under adverse
weather, poor lighting, or high-speed motion often suffer from severe noise and
blur. Such degradations significantly reduce the accuracy of license plate
recognition systems, especially when the plate occupies only a small region
within the full vehicle image. Restoring these degraded images a fast realtime
manner is thus a crucial pre-processing step to enhance recognition
performance. In this work, we propose a Vertical Residual Autoencoder (VRAE)
architecture designed for the image enhancement task in traffic surveillance.
The method incorporates an enhancement strategy that employs an auxiliary
block, which injects input-aware features at each encoding stage to guide the
representation learning process, enabling better general information
preservation throughout the network compared to conventional autoencoders.
Experiments on a vehicle image dataset with visible license plates demonstrate
that our method consistently outperforms Autoencoder (AE), Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN), and Flow-Based (FB) approaches. Compared with AE at
the same depth, it improves PSNR by about 20\%, reduces NMSE by around 50\%,
and enhances SSIM by 1\%, while requiring only a marginal increase of roughly
1\% in parameters.

as surveillance, autonomous driving, and sports analytics. However, maintaining
consistent object identities across multiple cameras remains challenging due to
viewpoint changes, lighting variations, and occlusions, which often lead to
tracking errors.Recent methods project features from multiple cameras into a
unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space to improve robustness against occlusion.
However, this projection introduces feature distortion and non-uniform density
caused by variations in object scale with distance. These issues degrade the
quality of the fused representation and reduce detection and tracking
accuracy.To address these problems, we propose SCFusion, a framework that
combines three techniques to improve multi-view feature integration. First, it
applies a sparse transformation to avoid unnatural interpolation during
projection. Next, it performs density-aware weighting to adaptively fuse
features based on spatial confidence and camera distance. Finally, it
introduces a multi-view consistency loss that encourages each camera to learn
discriminative features independently before fusion.Experiments show that
SCFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching an IDF1 score of 95.9%
on WildTrack and a MODP of 89.2% on MultiviewX, outperforming the baseline
method TrackTacular. These results demonstrate that SCFusion effectively
mitigates the limitations of conventional BEV projection and provides a robust
and accurate solution for multi-view object detection and tracking.

TL;DR: LD-ViCE是一个基于潜在扩散模型的视频反事实解释框架，通过潜在空间操作降低计算成本，生成现实且可解释的反事实解释，在多个视频数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频AI系统在安全关键领域应用广泛，但现有解释技术存在时间连贯性不足、鲁棒性差、缺乏因果洞察等问题，需要更有效的解释方法来增强模型可信度。

Method: 使用最先进的扩散模型在潜在空间操作，通过额外的细化步骤生成现实且可解释的反事实解释，显著降低计算成本。

Result: 在三个视频数据集（EchoNet-Dynamic、FERV39k、Something-Something V2）上，LD-ViCE比现有最优方法R2分数提升高达68%，推理时间减少一半，生成语义有意义且时间连贯的解释。

Conclusion: LD-ViCE是向安全关键领域可信AI部署迈出的重要一步，为视频AI模型提供了有效的解释工具。

Abstract: Video-based AI systems are increasingly adopted in safety-critical domains
such as autonomous driving and healthcare. However, interpreting their
decisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of
video data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation
techniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence, insufficient
robustness, and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual
explanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target
model, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent
Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework
designed to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous
approaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations
by operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while
producing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional
refinement step. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LD-ViCE
across three diverse video datasets, including EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac
ultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action
recognition). LD-ViCE outperforms a recent state-of-the-art method, achieving
an increase in R2 score of up to 68% while reducing inference time by half.
Qualitative analysis confirms that LD-ViCE generates semantically meaningful
and temporally coherent explanations, offering valuable insights into the
target model behavior. LD-ViCE represents a valuable step toward the
trustworthy deployment of AI in safety-critical domains.

TL;DR: 提出了HyperTTA框架，通过多退化数据集构建、光谱-空间Transformer分类器和轻量级测试时适应策略，显著提升了高光谱图像分类在多种退化条件下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像分类模型对噪声、模糊、压缩和大气效应等现实世界退化引起的分布偏移高度敏感，需要提高模型在各种退化条件下的鲁棒性。

Method: 1) 构建包含9种代表性退化的多退化高光谱数据集；2) 设计光谱-空间Transformer分类器(SSTC)，采用多级感受野机制和标签平滑正则化；3) 提出置信感知熵最小化LayerNorm适配器(CELA)，仅更新LayerNorm层的仿射参数。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，HyperTTA在各种退化场景下均优于现有基线方法，验证了其分类主干和TTA方案的有效性。

Conclusion: HyperTTA框架通过系统化的数据集构建、先进的分类器设计和轻量级测试时适应策略，成功提升了高光谱图像分类在多样化退化条件下的鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification models are highly sensitive to
distribution shifts caused by various real-world degradations such as noise,
blur, compression, and atmospheric effects. To address this challenge, we
propose HyperTTA, a unified framework designed to enhance model robustness
under diverse degradation conditions. Specifically, we first construct a
multi-degradation hyperspectral dataset that systematically simulates nine
representative types of degradations, providing a comprehensive benchmark for
robust classification evaluation. Based on this, we design a spectral-spatial
transformer classifier (SSTC) enhanced with a multi-level receptive field
mechanism and label smoothing regularization to jointly capture multi-scale
spatial context and improve generalization. Furthermore, HyperTTA incorporates
a lightweight test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy, the confidence-aware
entropy-minimized LayerNorm adapter (CELA), which updates only the affine
parameters of LayerNorm layers by minimizing prediction entropy on
high-confidence unlabeled target samples. This confidence-aware adaptation
prevents unreliable updates from noisy predictions, enabling robust and dynamic
adaptation without access to source data or target annotations. Extensive
experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyperTTA outperforms
existing baselines across a wide range of degradation scenarios, validating the
effectiveness of both its classification backbone and the proposed TTA scheme.
Code will be made available publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测个体化高分辨率直觉皮层厚度轨迹对于检测细微直觉变化、探索神经退行性过程和提早干预至关重要，但因直觉皮的复杂非欧几里形状和多模态数据整合而面临挑战

Method: 提出球面布朗运动桥扩散模型(SBDM)，采用双向条件布朗运动桥扩散过程预测直觉表面顶点级的直觉皮层厚度轨迹，设计了条件球面U-Net(CoS-UNet)去噪模型，结合球面卷积和密集交叉注意力机制整合直觉表面和表格条件

Result: 在ADNI和OASIS纵向数据集上进行实验，SBDM实现了显著降低的预测错误，超过之前方法，同时能够生成个体的事实和反事实直觉皮层厚度轨迹

Conclusion: SBDM为直觉皮层厚度预测提供了一个有效的新框架，能够探索假想性直觉发育场景，在神经退行性疾病的早期识别和个体化干预方面具有重要价值

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of individualized, high-resolution cortical thickness
(CTh) trajectories is essential for detecting subtle cortical changes,
providing invaluable insights into neurodegenerative processes and facilitating
earlier and more precise intervention strategies. However, CTh forecasting is a
challenging task due to the intricate non-Euclidean geometry of the cerebral
cortex and the need to integrate multi-modal data for subject-specific
predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce the Spherical Brownian
Bridge Diffusion Model (SBDM). Specifically, we propose a bidirectional
conditional Brownian bridge diffusion process to forecast CTh trajectories at
the vertex level of registered cortical surfaces. Our technical contribution
includes a new denoising model, the conditional spherical U-Net (CoS-UNet),
which combines spherical convolutions and dense cross-attention to integrate
cortical surfaces and tabular conditions seamlessly. Compared to previous
approaches, SBDM achieves significantly reduced prediction errors, as
demonstrated by our experiments based on longitudinal datasets from the ADNI
and OASIS. Additionally, we demonstrate SBDM's ability to generate individual
factual and counterfactual CTh trajectories, offering a novel framework for
exploring hypothetical scenarios of cortical development.

Motivation: 当前大多数Mamba基础视觉模型集中于网络架构和扫描路径，对状态空间模型模块本身的潜力研究不够

Method: 提出一阶状态空间模型(FSSM)，在SSM中应用一阶指数拟合条件，求解新的离散化形式并分析累计误差

Result: 在5个标准数据集上提升MambaIR性能，超越当前轻量级SR方法，达到最先进水平

Conclusion: FSSM通过结合前后上下文关联性，在不增加参数的情况下有效提升了SSM模块的表现能力

Abstract: State space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have shown promise in NLP
tasks and are increasingly applied to vision tasks. However, most Mamba-based
vision models focus on network architecture and scan paths, with little
attention to the SSM module. In order to explore the potential of SSMs, we
modified the calculation process of SSM without increasing the number of
parameters to improve the performance on lightweight super-resolution tasks. In
this paper, we introduce the First-order State Space Model (FSSM) to improve
the original Mamba module, enhancing performance by incorporating token
correlations. We apply a first-order hold condition in SSMs, derive the new
discretized form, and analyzed cumulative error. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that FSSM improves the performance of MambaIR on five benchmark
datasets without additionally increasing the number of parameters, and
surpasses current lightweight SR methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.

TL;DR: 提出基于互信息的多视图对比自监督学习方法，解决不平衡数据集问题，通过分离类内和类间判别特征来提升尾部类别的表征能力，在多个不平衡数据集上达到新的SOTA准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比自监督学习在平衡数据集上表现良好，但在不平衡数据集上泛化能力不足。受Yann LeCun关于多视图框架可扩展到多于两个视图的启发，需要为不平衡数据集开发更鲁棒的自监督学习方法。

Method: 基于互信息理论提出多于两个视图的目标函数，引入新的损失函数来过滤极端特征，分离类内和类间判别特征，从而学习更好的表征。

Result: 在多种自监督框架（对比和非对比）上验证有效，在Cifar10-LT上提升2%（Resnet-18），Cifar100-LT提升5%（Resnet-18），Imagenet-LT提升3%（Resnet-50），达到新的SOTA准确率。

Conclusion: 多视图目标函数能有效处理不平衡数据集问题，通过理论分析和实验验证证明了该方法在提取尾部类别代表性特征方面的优势，为自监督学习在不平衡数据场景中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: The robustness of contrastive self-supervised learning (CSSL) for imbalanced
datasets is largely unexplored. CSSL usually makes use of \emph{multi-view}
assumptions to learn discriminatory features via similar and dissimilar data
samples. CSSL works well on balanced datasets, but does not generalize well for
imbalanced datasets. In a very recent paper, as part of future work, Yann LeCun
pointed out that the self-supervised multiview framework can be extended to
cases involving \emph{more than two views}. Taking a cue from this insight we
propose a theoretical justification based on the concept of \emph{mutual
information} to support the \emph{more than two views} objective and apply it
to the problem of dataset imbalance in self-supervised learning. The proposed
method helps extract representative characteristics of the tail classes by
segregating between \emph{intra} and \emph{inter} discriminatory
characteristics. We introduce a loss function that helps us to learn better
representations by filtering out extreme features. Experimental evaluation on a
variety of self-supervised frameworks (both contrastive and non-contrastive)
also prove that the \emph{more than two view} objective works well for
imbalanced datasets. We achieve a new state-of-the-art accuracy in
self-supervised imbalanced dataset classification (2\% improvement in
Cifar10-LT using Resnet-18, 5\% improvement in Cifar100-LT using Resnet-18, 3\%
improvement in Imagenet-LT (1k) using Resnet-50).

Motivation: 解决单个自然语言提示转换为多步图像分析任务的需求，提供统一、可靠的工作流程。

Method: 组合开放词汇检测、可提示分割、文本条件塞充和视觉语言描述技术，通过阈值调整、截图检查、资源意识默认值等集成选择降低脆弱性。

Conclusion: 提供了一种透明、可靠的模式组装方案，通过明确的护栏和运维实践提高了物体替换、场景增强和删除任务的可靠性。

Abstract: Prompt-driven image analysis converts a single natural-language instruction
into multiple steps: locate, segment, edit, and describe. We present a
practical case study of a unified pipeline that combines open-vocabulary
detection, promptable segmentation, text-conditioned inpainting, and
vision-language description into a single workflow. The system works end to end
from a single prompt, retains intermediate artifacts for transparent debugging
(such as detections, masks, overlays, edited images, and before and after
composites), and provides the same functionality through an interactive UI and
a scriptable CLI for consistent, repeatable runs. We highlight integration
choices that reduce brittleness, including threshold adjustments, mask
inspection with light morphology, and resource-aware defaults. In a small,
single-word prompt segment, detection and segmentation produced usable masks in
over 90% of cases with an accuracy above 85% based on our criteria. On a
high-end GPU, inpainting makes up 60 to 75% of total runtime under typical
guidance and sampling settings, which highlights the need for careful tuning.
The study offers implementation-guided advice on thresholds, mask tightness,
and diffusion parameters, and details version pinning, artifact logging, and
seed control to support replay. Our contribution is a transparent, reliable
pattern for assembling modern vision and multimodal models behind a single
prompt, with clear guardrails and operational practices that improve
reliability in object replacement, scene augmentation, and removal.

Motivation: 水下目标检测在海洋应用中至关重要，但面临图像质量退化、目标相关问题、数据挑战、计算约束和方法限制等多重困难，现有方法难以完全解决这些复杂的水下环境问题。

Method: 系统地将UOD挑战分为五大类，分析从传统图像处理到现代深度学习方法的演进，探索LVLMs的多模态能力，并通过案例研究展示DALL-E 3合成数据生成和Florence-2 LVLM微调的应用。

Result: 识别出三个关键发现：当前UOD方法不足以完全解决动态水下环境中的挑战；LVLMs合成数据生成有潜力但需要改进；LVLMs在UOD中前景广阔但实时应用仍需优化研究。

Conclusion: LVLMs为水下目标检测带来了新的机遇，但在实际应用中仍需要进一步研究来提升合成数据的真实性和实时处理能力，以充分发挥其在水下环境中的潜力。

Abstract: Underwater object detection (UOD) is vital to diverse marine applications,
including oceanographic research, underwater robotics, and marine conservation.
However, UOD faces numerous challenges that compromise its performance. Over
the years, various methods have been proposed to address these issues, but they
often fail to fully capture the complexities of underwater environments. This
review systematically categorizes UOD challenges into five key areas: Image
quality degradation, target-related issues, data-related challenges,
computational and processing constraints, and limitations in detection
methodologies. To address these challenges, we analyze the progression from
traditional image processing and object detection techniques to modern
approaches. Additionally, we explore the potential of large vision-language
models (LVLMs) in UOD, leveraging their multi-modal capabilities demonstrated
in other domains. We also present case studies, including synthetic dataset
generation using DALL-E 3 and fine-tuning Florence-2 LVLM for UOD. This review
identifies three key insights: (i) Current UOD methods are insufficient to
fully address challenges like image degradation and small object detection in
dynamic underwater environments. (ii) Synthetic data generation using LVLMs
shows potential for augmenting datasets but requires further refinement to
ensure realism and applicability. (iii) LVLMs hold significant promise for UOD,
but their real-time application remains under-explored, requiring further
research on optimization techniques.

Motivation: 开发对时间变化敏感的视频表示，解决现有视频嵌入在区分时间相反动作（如开门vs关门）方面的不足。

Method: 基于感知拉直启发的自监督适应方法，在冻结图像特征序列上注入时间敏感性，使用具有归纳偏置潜在空间的自动编码器。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成紧凑但时间敏感的视频表示，有效解决手性动作识别问题，并可与现有模型结合提升性能。

Abstract: Our objective is to develop compact video representations that are sensitive
to visual change over time. To measure such time-sensitivity, we introduce a
new task: chiral action recognition, where one needs to distinguish between a
pair of temporally opposite actions, such as "opening vs. closing a door",
"approaching vs. moving away from something", "folding vs. unfolding paper",
etc. Such actions (i) occur frequently in everyday life, (ii) require
understanding of simple visual change over time (in object state, size, spatial
position, count . . . ), and (iii) are known to be poorly represented by many
video embeddings. Our goal is to build time aware video representations which
offer linear separability between these chiral pairs. To that end, we propose a
self-supervised adaptation recipe to inject time-sensitivity into a sequence of
frozen image features. Our model is based on an auto-encoder with a latent
space with inductive bias inspired by perceptual straightening. We show that
this results in a compact but time-sensitive video representation for the
proposed task across three datasets: Something-Something, EPIC-Kitchens, and
Charade. Our method (i) outperforms much larger video models pre-trained on
large-scale video datasets, and (ii) leads to an improvement in classification
performance on standard benchmarks when combined with these existing models.

Conclusion: HuMo成功解决了多模态协调难题，通过创新的数据集构建、训练策略和推理机制，实现了协作式多模态控制的人类视频生成。

Abstract: Human-Centric Video Generation (HCVG) methods seek to synthesize human videos
from multimodal inputs, including text, image, and audio. Existing methods
struggle to effectively coordinate these heterogeneous modalities due to two
challenges: the scarcity of training data with paired triplet conditions and
the difficulty of collaborating the sub-tasks of subject preservation and
audio-visual sync with multimodal inputs. In this work, we present HuMo, a
unified HCVG framework for collaborative multimodal control. For the first
challenge, we construct a high-quality dataset with diverse and paired text,
reference images, and audio. For the second challenge, we propose a two-stage
progressive multimodal training paradigm with task-specific strategies. For the
subject preservation task, to maintain the prompt following and visual
generation abilities of the foundation model, we adopt the minimal-invasive
image injection strategy. For the audio-visual sync task, besides the commonly
adopted audio cross-attention layer, we propose a focus-by-predicting strategy
that implicitly guides the model to associate audio with facial regions. For
joint learning of controllabilities across multimodal inputs, building on
previously acquired capabilities, we progressively incorporate the audio-visual
sync task. During inference, for flexible and fine-grained multimodal control,
we design a time-adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance strategy that dynamically
adjusts guidance weights across denoising steps. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that HuMo surpasses specialized state-of-the-art methods in
sub-tasks, establishing a unified framework for collaborative
multimodal-conditioned HCVG. Project Page:

Conclusion: MESH提供了一个有效且全面的方法来识别视频中的幻觉，揭示了LVMs在复杂视频理解任务中的局限性

Abstract: Large Video Models (LVMs) build on the semantic capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) and vision modules by integrating temporal information
to better understand dynamic video content. Despite their progress, LVMs are
prone to hallucinations-producing inaccurate or irrelevant descriptions.
Current benchmarks for video hallucination depend heavily on manual
categorization of video content, neglecting the perception-based processes
through which humans naturally interpret videos. We introduce MESH, a benchmark
designed to evaluate hallucinations in LVMs systematically. MESH uses a
Question-Answering framework with binary and multi-choice formats incorporating
target and trap instances. It follows a bottom-up approach, evaluating basic
objects, coarse-to-fine subject features, and subject-action pairs, aligning
with human video understanding. We demonstrate that MESH offers an effective
and comprehensive approach for identifying hallucinations in videos. Our
evaluations show that while LVMs excel at recognizing basic objects and
features, their susceptibility to hallucinations increases markedly when
handling fine details or aligning multiple actions involving various subjects
in longer videos.

Motivation: 传统的单视角分类或回归模型无法充分捕捉植物表型特征的所有信息，影响植物健康评估和收获成熟度预测的准确性

Method: 使用多视角数据集，通过随机选择24个视角（选择向量）学习视角不变嵌入，并尝试使用所有5个高度级别的120个视角（选择矩阵）进行随机选择

Result: ViewSparsifier方法在植物年龄预测和叶片计数估计两个任务中都获得了优胜

Conclusion: 多视角方法能够有效提升植物表型分析的准确性，随机视角选择策略是未来研究的有价值方向

Abstract: Plant phenotyping involves analyzing observable characteristics of plants to
better understand their growth, health, and development. In the context of deep
learning, this analysis is often approached through single-view classification
or regression models. However, these methods often fail to capture all
information required for accurate estimation of target phenotypic traits, which
can adversely affect plant health assessment and harvest readiness prediction.
To address this, the Growth Modelling (GroMo) Grand Challenge at ACM Multimedia
2025 provides a multi-view dataset featuring multiple plants and two tasks:
Plant Age Prediction and Leaf Count Estimation. Each plant is photographed from
multiple heights and angles, leading to significant overlap and redundancy in
the captured information. To learn view-invariant embeddings, we incorporate 24
views, referred to as the selection vector, in a random selection. Our
ViewSparsifier approach won both tasks. For further improvement and as a
direction for future research, we also experimented with randomized view
selection across all five height levels (120 views total), referred to as
selection matrices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态模型在医学图像分割中表现较差，主要因为抽象文本提示与细粒度医学视觉特征之间存在显著语义空间，以及由此导致的特征分散问题。

Method: 提出期望最大化(EM)聚合机制，通过动态聚类特征为紧凑语义中心来减少特征分散；设计文本导向像素解码器，利用域不变文本知识导向深层视觉表征来缩小语义空间。

Result: 在公开心脏和眼底数据集上进行的大量实验表明，该方法在多个域逆向法测试中一贯超过现有SOTA方法。

Conclusion: 通迈语义聚合视角重新考虑多模态融合问题，所提出的两种机制的协同作用显著提升了模型的法性能力，为医学图像分割领域提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal models have achieved remarkable success in natural image
segmentation, yet they often underperform when applied to the medical domain.
Through extensive study, we attribute this performance gap to the challenges of
multimodal fusion, primarily the significant semantic gap between abstract
textual prompts and fine-grained medical visual features, as well as the
resulting feature dispersion. To address these issues, we revisit the problem
from the perspective of semantic aggregation. Specifically, we propose an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) Aggregation mechanism and a Text-Guided Pixel
Decoder. The former mitigates feature dispersion by dynamically clustering
features into compact semantic centers to enhance cross-modal correspondence.
The latter is designed to bridge the semantic gap by leveraging
domain-invariant textual knowledge to effectively guide deep visual
representations. The synergy between these two mechanisms significantly
improves the model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments on public
cardiac and fundus datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing SOTA approaches across multiple domain generalization
benchmarks.

gradient features and polynomial trends to capture both local variability and
broad structure. To handle data gaps, we employ a hybrid loss that combines
confidence-weighted radar supervision with dynamically balanced regularization.
Applied to three Greenland subregions, GraphTopoNet outperforms interpolation,
convolutional, and graph-based baselines, reducing error by up to 60 percent
while preserving fine-scale glacial features. The resulting bed maps improve
reliability for operational modeling, supporting agencies engaged in climate
forecasting and policy. More broadly, GraphTopoNet shows how graph machine
learning can convert sparse, uncertain geophysical observations into actionable
knowledge at continental scale.

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to significantly reduce the manual workload
required from medical professionals in complex 3D segmentation tasks that
cannot be yet fully automated. For instance, in radiotherapy planning, organs
at risk must be accurately identified in computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) scans to ensure they are spared from harmful radiation.
Similarly, diagnosing age-related degenerative diseases such as sarcopenia,
which involve progressive muscle volume loss and strength, is commonly based on
muscular mass measurements often obtained from manual segmentation of medical
volumes. To alleviate the manual-segmentation burden, this paper introduces an
implicit shape prior to segment volumes from sparse slice manual annotations
generalized to the multi-organ case, along with a simple framework for
automatically selecting the most informative slices to guide and minimize the
next interactions. The experimental validation shows the method's effectiveness
on two medical use cases: assisted segmentation in the context of at risks
organs for brain cancer patients, and acceleration of the creation of a new
database with unseen muscle shapes for patients with sarcopenia.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate
text-to-image (TTI) generation systems, providing automated judgments based on
visual and textual context. However, these "judge" models often suffer from
biases, overconfidence, and inconsistent performance across diverse image
domains. While prompt ensembling has shown promise for mitigating these issues
in unimodal, text-only settings, our experiments reveal that standard
ensembling methods fail to generalize effectively for TTI tasks. To address
these limitations, we propose a new multimodal-aware method called Multimodal
Mixture-of-Bayesian Prompt Ensembles (MMB). Our method uses a Bayesian prompt
ensemble approach augmented by image clustering, allowing the judge to
dynamically assign prompt weights based on the visual characteristics of each
sample. We show that MMB improves accuracy in pairwise preference judgments and
greatly enhances calibration, making it easier to gauge the judge's true
uncertainty. In evaluations on two TTI benchmarks, HPSv2 and MJBench, MMB
outperforms existing baselines in alignment with human annotations and
calibration across varied image content. Our findings highlight the importance
of multimodal-specific strategies for judge calibration and suggest a promising
path forward for reliable large-scale TTI evaluation.

Abstract: With imaging devices delivering ever-higher resolutions and the emerging
diffusion-based forgery methods, current detectors trained only on traditional
datasets (with splicing, copy-moving and object removal forgeries) lack
exposure to this new manipulation type. To address this, we propose a novel
high-resolution SIF dataset of 1200+ diffusion-generated manipulations with
semantically extracted masks. However, this also imposes a challenge on
existing methods, as they face significant computational resource constraints
due to their prohibitive computational complexities. Therefore, we propose a
novel EfficientIML model with a lightweight, three-stage EfficientRWKV
backbone. EfficientRWKV's hybrid state-space and attention network captures
global context and local details in parallel, while a multi-scale supervision
strategy enforces consistency across hierarchical predictions. Extensive
evaluations on our dataset and standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach outperforms ViT-based and other SOTA lightweight baselines in
localization performance, FLOPs and inference speed, underscoring its
suitability for real-time forensic applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model
(SAM), have significantly impacted medical image segmentation, especially in
retinal imaging, where precise segmentation is vital for diagnosis. Despite
this progress, current methods face critical challenges: 1) modality ambiguity
in textual disease descriptions, 2) a continued reliance on manual prompting
for SAM-based workflows, and 3) a lack of a unified framework, with most
methods being modality- and task-specific. To overcome these hurdles, we
propose CLIP-unified Auto-Prompt Segmentation (\CLAPS), a novel method for
unified segmentation across diverse tasks and modalities in retinal imaging.
Our approach begins by pre-training a CLIP-based image encoder on a large,
multi-modal retinal dataset to handle data scarcity and distribution imbalance.
We then leverage GroundingDINO to automatically generate spatial bounding box
prompts by detecting local lesions. To unify tasks and resolve ambiguity, we
use text prompts enhanced with a unique "modality signature" for each imaging
modality. Ultimately, these automated textual and spatial prompts guide SAM to
execute precise segmentation, creating a fully automated and unified pipeline.
Extensive experiments on 12 diverse datasets across 11 critical segmentation
categories show that CLAPS achieves performance on par with specialized expert
models while surpassing existing benchmarks across most metrics, demonstrating
its broad generalizability as a foundation model.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have taken a great step towards AGI. Meanwhile,
an increasing number of domain-specific problems such as math and programming
boost these general-purpose models to continuously evolve via learning deeper
expertise. Now is thus the time further to extend the diversity of specialized
applications for knowledgeable LLMs, though collecting high quality data with
unexpected and informative tasks is challenging. In this paper, we propose to
use advertisement (ad) videos as a challenging test-bed to probe the ability of
LLMs in perceiving beyond the objective physical content of common visual
domain. Our motivation is to take full advantage of the clue-rich and
information-dense ad videos' traits, e.g., marketing logic, persuasive
strategies, and audience engagement. Our contribution is three-fold: (1) To our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to use ad videos with well-designed tasks
to evaluate LLMs. We contribute AdsQA, a challenging ad Video QA benchmark
derived from 1,544 ad videos with 10,962 clips, totaling 22.7 hours, providing
5 challenging tasks. (2) We propose ReAd-R, a Deepseek-R1 styled RL model that
reflects on questions, and generates answers via reward-driven optimization.
(3) We benchmark 14 top-tier LLMs on AdsQA, and our \texttt{ReAd-R}~achieves
the state-of-the-art outperforming strong competitors equipped with long-chain

Conclusion: 该研究提出的方法能够有效解决桌面多模态图像诊断中的数据获取难题，通过OCT空间前知提升了仅使用底射图像的疾病识别性能。

Abstract: Significant advancements in AI-driven multimodal medical image diagnosis have
led to substantial improvements in ophthalmic disease identification in recent
years. However, acquiring paired multimodal ophthalmic images remains
prohibitively expensive. While fundus photography is simple and cost-effective,
the limited availability of OCT data and inherent modality imbalance hinder
further progress. Conventional approaches that rely solely on fundus or textual
features often fail to capture fine-grained spatial information, as each
imaging modality provides distinct cues about lesion predilection sites. In
this study, we propose a novel unpaired multimodal framework \UOPSL that
utilizes extensive OCT-derived spatial priors to dynamically identify
predilection sites, enhancing fundus image-based disease recognition. Our
approach bridges unpaired fundus and OCTs via extended disease text
descriptions. Initially, we employ contrastive learning on a large corpus of
unpaired OCT and fundus images while simultaneously learning the predilection
sites matrix in the OCT latent space. Through extensive optimization, this
matrix captures lesion localization patterns within the OCT feature space.
During the fine-tuning or inference phase of the downstream classification task
based solely on fundus images, where paired OCT data is unavailable, we
eliminate OCT input and utilize the predilection sites matrix to assist in
fundus image classification learning. Extensive experiments conducted on 9
diverse datasets across 28 critical categories demonstrate that our framework
outperforms existing benchmarks.

Motivation: 扩散模型在数据稀缺领域面临挑战，需要大量重新训练或昂贵的配对数据。为了解决这些限制，需要一种能够在部分配对数据下有效桥接域差距的方法。

Method: 通过在共享潜在空间中对齐源域和目标域分布，将预训练的源域扩散模型与目标域潜在对齐扩散模型（LADM）集成，利用部分配对的潜在表示进行训练。

Result: 实验结果表明在部分监督下的深度到图像转换任务中表现优异，并能扩展到多源转换（深度图和分割掩码）和多目标转换（类条件风格迁移）。

Conclusion: LADB为现实世界域转换提供了一个可扩展且通用的解决方案，特别适用于数据标注成本高或不完整的场景。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality outputs but face challenges
in data-scarce domains, where exhaustive retraining or costly paired data are
often required. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Aligned
Diffusion Bridges (LADB), a semi-supervised framework for sample-to-sample
translation that effectively bridges domain gaps using partially paired data.
By aligning source and target distributions within a shared latent space, LADB
seamlessly integrates pretrained source-domain diffusion models with a
target-domain Latent Aligned Diffusion Model (LADM), trained on partially
paired latent representations. This approach enables deterministic domain
mapping without the need for full supervision. Compared to unpaired methods,
which often lack controllability, and fully paired approaches that require
large, domain-specific datasets, LADB strikes a balance between fidelity and
diversity by leveraging a mixture of paired and unpaired latent-target
couplings. Our experimental results demonstrate superior performance in
depth-to-image translation under partial supervision. Furthermore, we extend
LADB to handle multi-source translation (from depth maps and segmentation
masks) and multi-target translation in a class-conditioned style transfer task,
showcasing its versatility in handling diverse and heterogeneous use cases.
Ultimately, we present LADB as a scalable and versatile solution for real-world
domain translation, particularly in scenarios where data annotation is costly
or incomplete.

Conclusion: DSLNet通过分离建模手势的形态和轨迹特征，有效解决了手语识别中的几何模糊问题，在性能和效率方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) is challenged by gestures that are
morphologically similar yet semantically distinct, a problem rooted in the
complex interplay between hand shape and motion trajectory. Existing methods,
often relying on a single reference frame, struggle to resolve this geometric
ambiguity. This paper introduces Dual-SignLanguageNet (DSLNet), a
dual-reference, dual-stream architecture that decouples and models gesture
morphology and trajectory in separate, complementary coordinate systems. Our
approach utilizes a wrist-centric frame for view-invariant shape analysis and a
facial-centric frame for context-aware trajectory modeling. These streams are
processed by specialized networks-a topology-aware graph convolution for shape
and a Finsler geometry-based encoder for trajectory-and are integrated via a
geometry-driven optimal transport fusion mechanism. DSLNet sets a new
state-of-the-art, achieving 93.70%, 89.97% and 99.79% accuracy on the
challenging WLASL-100, WLASL-300 and LSA64 datasets, respectively, with
significantly fewer parameters than competing models.

Motivation: 传统光流估计方法需要大量标注数据，而真实标注获取困难。本文旨在开发无需真实标注的无监督方法，利用分形几何和自相似性原理来捕获精细细节和长距离运动模式。

Method: 采用分形变形网络(FDN)架构，递归编码器-解码器结构配合跳跃连接；基于变分公式的训练目标，结合L1和L2数据保真度项以及总变差正则化来保证亮度恒定性和空间平滑性。

Result: 在合成和基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法能够产生准确、平滑且保持边缘的光流场，特别适用于高分辨率数据和标注有限的情况。

Conclusion: FractalPINN-Flow成功实现了无监督光流估计，通过分形网络结构和变分正则化方法，在缺乏标注数据的情况下仍能获得高质量的光流结果。

Abstract: We present FractalPINN-Flow, an unsupervised deep learning framework for
dense optical flow estimation that learns directly from consecutive grayscale
frames without requiring ground truth. The architecture centers on the Fractal
Deformation Network (FDN) - a recursive encoder-decoder inspired by fractal
geometry and self-similarity. Unlike traditional CNNs with sequential
downsampling, FDN uses repeated encoder-decoder nesting with skip connections
to capture both fine-grained details and long-range motion patterns. The
training objective is based on a classical variational formulation using total
variation (TV) regularization. Specifically, we minimize an energy functional
that combines $L^1$ and $L^2$ data fidelity terms to enforce brightness
constancy, along with a TV term that promotes spatial smoothness and coherent
flow fields. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets show that
FractalPINN-Flow produces accurate, smooth, and edge-preserving optical flow
fields. The model is especially effective for high-resolution data and
scenarios with limited annotations.

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) advance, their large-scale
architectures pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained
environments. In the age of large models, where energy efficiency,
computational scalability and environmental sustainability are paramount, the
development of lightweight and high-performance models is critical for
real-world applications. As such, we propose a lightweight MLLM framework for
end-to-end visual question answering. Our proposed approach centres on
BreezeCLIP, a compact yet powerful vision-language encoder optimised for
efficient multimodal understanding. With only 1.2 billion parameters overall,
our model significantly reduces computational cost while achieving performance
comparable to standard-size MLLMs. Experiments conducted on multiple datasets
further validate its effectiveness in balancing accuracy and efficiency. The
modular and extensible design enables generalisation to broader multimodal
tasks. The proposed lightweight vision-language framework is denoted as BcQLM
(BreezeCLIP-enhanced Q-Gated Multimodal Language Model). It offers a promising
path toward deployable MLLMs under practical hardware constraints. The source

Conclusion: CQ方法首次有效桥接了2D和3D拥挤环境检测，具有通用性和可推广性，代码已开源

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for end-to-end crowd detection that
leverages object density information to enhance existing transformer-based
detectors. We present CrowdQuery (CQ), whose core component is our CQ module
that predicts and subsequently embeds an object density map. The embedded
density information is then systematically integrated into the decoder.
Existing density map definitions typically depend on head positions or
object-based spatial statistics. Our method extends these definitions to
include individual bounding box dimensions. By incorporating density
information into object queries, our method utilizes density-guided queries to
improve detection in crowded scenes. CQ is universally applicable to both 2D
and 3D detection without requiring additional data. Consequently, we are the
first to design a method that effectively bridges 2D and 3D detection in
crowded environments. We demonstrate the integration of CQ into both a general
2D and 3D transformer-based object detector, introducing the architectures CQ2D
and CQ3D. CQ is not limited to the specific transformer models we selected.
Experiments on the STCrowd dataset for both 2D and 3D domains show significant
performance improvements compared to the base models, outperforming most
state-of-the-art methods. When integrated into a state-of-the-art crowd
detector, CQ can further improve performance on the challenging CrowdHuman
dataset, demonstrating its generalizability. The code is released at

Motivation: 现有公开数据集缺乏地图先验、当前地图和传感器数据的三元组，导致方法只能依赖合成先验，产生不一致性和显著的sim2real差距。

Method: 采用双向映射框架，将大规模修改分解为地图元素级别的细粒度原子变化，确保可解释性，实现精确的变化检测和集成。

Result: 实验表明，在ArgoTweak上训练的模型相比合成先验显著减少了sim2real差距，消融实验进一步验证了结构化先验和详细变化标注的重要性。

Conclusion: ArgoTweak为可解释的先验辅助高精地图建立了基准，推动了可扩展、自改进的地图解决方案发展。

Abstract: Reliable integration of prior information is crucial for self-verifying and
self-updating HD maps. However, no public dataset includes the required triplet
of prior maps, current maps, and sensor data. As a result, existing methods
must rely on synthetic priors, which create inconsistencies and lead to a
significant sim2real gap. To address this, we introduce ArgoTweak, the first
dataset to complete the triplet with realistic map priors. At its core,
ArgoTweak employs a bijective mapping framework, breaking down large-scale
modifications into fine-grained atomic changes at the map element level, thus
ensuring interpretability. This paradigm shift enables accurate change
detection and integration while preserving unchanged elements with high
fidelity. Experiments show that training models on ArgoTweak significantly
reduces the sim2real gap compared to synthetic priors. Extensive ablations
further highlight the impact of structured priors and detailed change
annotations. By establishing a benchmark for explainable, prior-aided HD
mapping, ArgoTweak advances scalable, self-improving mapping solutions. The
dataset, baselines, map modification toolbox, and further resources are
available at https://kth-rpl.github.io/ArgoTweak/.

TL;DR: 使用深度学习对移动手机拍摄的皮肤图像进行碳中毒症辅助诊断，Transformer模型表现最优，准确率达86%，具有良好的可解释性和部署可行性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 碳中毒症在南亚和东南亚是严重公共健康问题，早期皮肤表现容易误诊，特别是在农村地区缺乏皮肤科医生，需要自动化的图像诊断方案来支持早期发现和及时干预

Method: 构建包含20个类别、超11000张图像的数据集，对深度学习模型（CNN和Transformer基础模型）进行测试，集成LIME和Grad-CAM提供模型可解释性，并开发网页版诊断工具

Result: Transformer模型显著超过CNN，Swin Transformer取得最佳结果（86%准确率），可解释性工具确认模型关注病变区域，外部验证表现良好，具有良好的演绎性

Conclusion: 该框架证明了深度学习在碳中毒症无侵入、可访问和可解释诊断中的潜力，可作为农村和资源有限社区的实用诊断工具，支持早期发现和及时干预

Abstract: Background: Arsenicosis is a serious public health concern in South and
Southeast Asia, primarily caused by long-term consumption of
arsenic-contaminated water. Its early cutaneous manifestations are clinically
significant but often underdiagnosed, particularly in rural areas with limited
access to dermatologists. Automated, image-based diagnostic solutions can
support early detection and timely interventions.
  Methods: In this study, we propose an end-to-end framework for arsenicosis
diagnosis using mobile phone-captured skin images. A dataset comprising 20
classes and over 11000 images of arsenic-induced and other dermatological
conditions was curated. Multiple deep learning architectures, including
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models, were
benchmarked for arsenicosis detection. Model interpretability was integrated
via LIME and Grad-CAM, while deployment feasibility was demonstrated through a
web-based diagnostic tool.
  Results: Transformer-based models significantly outperformed CNNs, with the
Swin Transformer achieving the best results (86\\% accuracy). LIME and Grad-CAM
visualizations confirmed that the models attended to lesion-relevant regions,
increasing clinical transparency and aiding in error analysis. The framework
also demonstrated strong performance on external validation samples, confirming
its ability to generalize beyond the curated dataset.
  Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of deep
learning for non-invasive, accessible, and explainable diagnosis of arsenicosis
from mobile-acquired images. By enabling reliable image-based screening, it can
serve as a practical diagnostic aid in rural and resource-limited communities,
where access to dermatologists is scarce, thereby supporting early detection
and timely intervention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机在星迹踪定向中具有潜力，但之前研究缺乏准确的真实值验证方法，需要一种可靠的方法来量化其精度

Method: 利用地球自转的高精度规律性作为真实值，通过固定指向夜空的事件相机系统，将相机输出与国际地球自转系统测量值进行对比

Result: 事件相机系统达到了18.47秒的均方根锐差和78.84秒的绝对锐差，结合其高动态范围、低能耗、高更新率等优势，显示了在星迹踪中的应用价值

Conclusion: 通过地球自转作为真实值的方法有效量化了事件相机星迹踪系统的精度，证明了其在低成本、低延迟定向任务中的实用性，为事件相机在太空应用中的推广提供了重要支撑

Abstract: Event-based cameras (EBCs) are a promising new technology for star
tracking-based attitude determination, but prior studies have struggled to
determine accurate ground truth for real data. We analyze the accuracy of an
EBC star tracking system utilizing the Earth's motion as the ground truth for
comparison. The Earth rotates in a regular way with very small irregularities
which are measured to the level of milli-arcseconds. By keeping an event camera
static and pointing it through a ground-based telescope at the night sky, we
create a system where the only camera motion in the celestial reference frame
is that induced by the Earth's rotation. The resulting event stream is
processed to generate estimates of orientation which we compare to the
International Earth Rotation and Reference System (IERS) measured orientation
of the Earth. The event camera system is able to achieve a root mean squared
across error of 18.47 arcseconds and an about error of 78.84 arcseconds.
Combined with the other benefits of event cameras over framing sensors (reduced
computation due to sparser data streams, higher dynamic range, lower energy
consumption, faster update rates), this level of accuracy suggests the utility
of event cameras for low-cost and low-latency star tracking. We provide all
code and data used to generate our results:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BEAMER提出了一种新的密集图像匹配方法，通过在每个尺度为每个源位置预测多个对应假设，而不是单一假设，提高了在深度不连续和强缩放情况下的匹配鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在每个尺度为每个源位置只产生单一对应假设，在深度不连续或目标图像是源图像的强缩放时，相邻源位置的对应点可能分布广泛，导致错误匹配。

Method: 采用beam search策略在每个尺度传播多个假设，并将这些多假设集成到交叉注意力层中，构建了BEAMER密集匹配架构，学习跨尺度保留和传播多个假设。

Result: BEAMER相比现有最先进方法显著更鲁棒，特别是在深度不连续和目标图像是源图像强缩放的情况下表现更好。

Conclusion: 预测多个对应假设而非单一假设的策略有效提升了密集图像匹配在挑战性场景下的性能，BEAMER架构为此提供了可行的实现方案。

Abstract: Dense image matching aims to find a correspondent for every pixel of a source
image in a partially overlapping target image. State-of-the-art methods
typically rely on a coarse-to-fine mechanism where a single correspondent
hypothesis is produced per source location at each scale. In challenging cases
-- such as at depth discontinuities or when the target image is a strong
zoom-in of the source image -- the correspondents of neighboring source
locations are often widely spread and predicting a single correspondent
hypothesis per source location at each scale may lead to erroneous matches. In
this paper, we investigate the idea of predicting multiple correspondent
hypotheses per source location at each scale instead. We consider a beam search
strategy to propagat multiple hypotheses at each scale and propose integrating
these multiple hypotheses into cross-attention layers, resulting in a novel
dense matching architecture called BEAMER. BEAMER learns to preserve and
propagate multiple hypotheses across scales, making it significantly more
robust than state-of-the-art methods, especially at depth discontinuities or
when the target image is a strong zoom-in of the source image.

Motivation: 现有的基准测试主要关注图像生成，而视频生成具有独特的时空复杂性，需要专门的系统性基准来评估和改进视频生成质量

Method: 构建大规模人工标注数据集，专注于从自然文本提示生成的视频中的时空伪影问题

Result: 引入了GeneVA数据集，填补了视频生成伪影评估的空白

Conclusion: GeneVA数据集能够支持关键应用，如基准测试模型性能和提升生成视频质量

Abstract: Recent advances in probabilistic generative models have extended capabilities
from static image synthesis to text-driven video generation. However, the
inherent randomness of their generation process can lead to unpredictable
artifacts, such as impossible physics and temporal inconsistency. Progress in
addressing these challenges requires systematic benchmarks, yet existing
datasets primarily focus on generative images due to the unique spatio-temporal
complexities of videos. To bridge this gap, we introduce GeneVA, a large-scale
artifact dataset with rich human annotations that focuses on spatio-temporal
artifacts in videos generated from natural text prompts. We hope GeneVA can
enable and assist critical applications, such as benchmarking model performance
and improving generative video quality.

TL;DR: RewardDance是一个可扩展的视觉生成奖励建模框架，通过生成式奖励范式解决现有方法的局限性，支持模型规模扩展到260亿参数，并有效解决了奖励黑客问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型在视觉生成中存在架构限制和模态约束，Bradley-Terry损失与视觉语言模型的next-token预测机制不匹配，且RLHF优化过程存在奖励黑客问题，阻碍了有效扩展。

Method: 提出RewardDance框架，将奖励分数重新定义为模型预测"yes"标记的概率，表示生成图像在特定标准下优于参考图像，使奖励目标与VLM架构内在对齐。支持模型规模扩展和上下文扩展（任务指令、参考示例、思维链推理）。

Result: RewardDance在文本到图像、文本到视频和图像到视频生成任务中显著超越最先进方法。大规模奖励模型在RL微调期间保持高奖励方差，证明其抗黑客攻击能力并能产生多样化高质量输出。

Conclusion: RewardDance解决了视觉生成奖励模型的扩展瓶颈和奖励黑客问题，通过生成式奖励范式实现了模型规模和上下文的双重扩展，有效缓解了模式崩溃问题。

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are critical for improving generation models via
Reinforcement Learning (RL), yet the RM scaling paradigm in visual generation
remains largely unexplored. It primarily due to fundamental limitations in
existing approaches: CLIP-based RMs suffer from architectural and input
modality constraints, while prevalent Bradley-Terry losses are fundamentally
misaligned with the next-token prediction mechanism of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), hindering effective scaling. More critically, the RLHF optimization
process is plagued by Reward Hacking issue, where models exploit flaws in the
reward signal without improving true quality. To address these challenges, we
introduce RewardDance, a scalable reward modeling framework that overcomes
these barriers through a novel generative reward paradigm. By reformulating the
reward score as the model's probability of predicting a "yes" token, indicating
that the generated image outperforms a reference image according to specific
criteria, RewardDance intrinsically aligns reward objectives with VLM
architectures. This alignment unlocks scaling across two dimensions: (1) Model
Scaling: Systematic scaling of RMs up to 26 billion parameters; (2) Context
Scaling: Integration of task-specific instructions, reference examples, and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
RewardDance significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in text-to-image,
text-to-video, and image-to-video generation. Crucially, we resolve the
persistent challenge of "reward hacking": Our large-scale RMs exhibit and
maintain high reward variance during RL fine-tuning, proving their resistance
to hacking and ability to produce diverse, high-quality outputs. It greatly
relieves the mode collapse problem that plagues smaller models.

Motivation: 三维动态场景重建是计算机视觉领域的挑战性任务，特别是对于织物等可变形物体。现有方法在处理单目视频的深度模糊问题和实现高质量物理渲染方面存在局限。

Method: 结合3D几何重建和基于物理的渲染外观估计，使用物理模拟进行布料几何变形和可微分渲染，引入了两个新的正则化项来解决单目视频中的深度模糊问题。

Result: 与最新方法相比，3D重建误差降低了2.64倍，每个场景平均运行时间为30分钟。优化的运动质量足以进行变形物体的外观估计，从单目RGB视频中恢复出清晰的细节。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了单目视频中织物3D重建的深度模糊问题，实现了高质量的几何重建和外观估计，为动态场景的物理渲染提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The reconstruction of three-dimensional dynamic scenes is a well-established
yet challenging task within the domain of computer vision. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach that combines the domains of 3D geometry
reconstruction and appearance estimation for physically based rendering and
present a system that is able to perform both tasks for fabrics, utilizing only
a single monocular RGB video sequence as input. In order to obtain realistic
and high-quality deformations and renderings, a physical simulation of the
cloth geometry and differentiable rendering are employed. In this paper, we
introduce two novel regularization terms for the 3D reconstruction task that
improve the plausibility of the reconstruction by addressing the depth
ambiguity problem in monocular video. In comparison with the most recent
methods in the field, we have reduced the error in the 3D reconstruction by a
factor of 2.64 while requiring a medium runtime of 30 min per scene.
Furthermore, the optimized motion achieves sufficient quality to perform an
appearance estimation of the deforming object, recovering sharp details from
this single monocular RGB video.

Conclusion: 这项工作将有效解决社交媒体中的不良问题，并为该领域的进一步研究提供基础。

Abstract: Language identification is the task of determining the languages for a given
text. In many real world scenarios, text may contain more than one language,
particularly in multilingual communities. Bilingual Language Identification
(BLID) is the task of identifying and distinguishing between two languages in a
given text. This paper presents BLID for languages spoken in the southern part
of Ethiopia, namely Wolaita and Gofa. The presence of words similarities and
differences between the two languages makes the language identification task
challenging. To overcome this challenge, we employed various experiments on
various approaches. Then, the combination of the BERT based pretrained language
model and LSTM approach performed better, with an F1 score of 0.72 on the test
set. As a result, the work will be effective in tackling unwanted social media

Motivation: 开源权重LLM面临恶意微调生成有害内容的风险，现有安全措施难以在保持模型通用能力的同时抵抗拥有完全模型访问权限的对手

Method: 使用双层优化程序，包含辅助对抗性超网络生成恶意LoRA权重，训练防御者LLM抵消这些对抗性权重的影响

Result: 在52种红队攻击测试中，AntiDote比篡改抵抗和遗忘基线方法强27.4%，在MMLU等能力基准测试中性能下降小于0.5%

Conclusion: AntiDote提供了一种实用且计算高效的方法，使安全性成为开源权重模型中更内在和弹性的属性

Abstract: The release of open-weight large language models (LLMs) creates a tension
between advancing accessible research and preventing misuse, such as malicious
fine-tuning to elicit harmful content. Current safety measures struggle to
preserve the general capabilities of the LLM while resisting a determined
adversary with full access to the model's weights and architecture, who can use
full-parameter fine-tuning to erase existing safeguards. To address this, we
introduce AntiDote, a bi-level optimization procedure for training LLMs to be
resistant to such tampering. AntiDote involves an auxiliary adversary
hypernetwork that learns to generate malicious Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
weights conditioned on the defender model's internal activations. The defender
LLM is then trained with an objective to nullify the effect of these
adversarial weight additions, forcing it to maintain its safety alignment. We
validate this approach against a diverse suite of 52 red-teaming attacks,
including jailbreak prompting, latent space manipulation, and direct
weight-space attacks. AntiDote is upto 27.4\% more robust against adversarial
attacks compared to both tamper-resistance and unlearning baselines. Crucially,
this robustness is achieved with a minimal trade-off in utility, incurring a
performance degradation of upto less than 0.5\% across capability benchmarks
including MMLU, HellaSwag, and GSM8K. Our work offers a practical and compute
efficient methodology for building open-weight models where safety is a more
integral and resilient property.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values is critical
for their safe and effective deployment across diverse user populations.
However, existing benchmarks often neglect cultural and demographic diversity,
leading to limited understanding of how value alignment generalizes globally.
In this work, we introduce MVPBench, a novel benchmark that systematically
evaluates LLMs' alignment with multi-dimensional human value preferences across
75 countries. MVPBench contains 24,020 high-quality instances annotated with
fine-grained value labels, personalized questions, and rich demographic
metadata, making it the most comprehensive resource of its kind to date. Using
MVPBench, we conduct an in-depth analysis of several state-of-the-art LLMs,
revealing substantial disparities in alignment performance across geographic
and demographic lines. We further demonstrate that lightweight fine-tuning
methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO), can significantly enhance value alignment in both in-domain and
out-of-domain settings. Our findings underscore the necessity for
population-aware alignment evaluation and provide actionable insights for

Abstract: Scientific literature is growing exponentially, creating a critical
bottleneck for researchers to efficiently synthesize knowledge. While
general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential in text processing,
they often fail to capture scientific domain-specific nuances (e.g., technical
jargon, methodological rigor) and struggle with complex scientific tasks,
limiting their utility for interdisciplinary research. To address these gaps,
this paper presents SciGPT, a domain-adapted foundation model for scientific
literature understanding and ScienceBench, an open source benchmark tailored to
evaluate scientific LLMs.
  Built on the Qwen3 architecture, SciGPT incorporates three key innovations:
(1) low-cost domain distillation via a two-stage pipeline to balance
performance and efficiency; (2) a Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) attention
mechanism that cuts memory consumption by 55\% for 32,000-token long-document
reasoning; and (3) knowledge-aware adaptation integrating domain ontologies to
bridge interdisciplinary knowledge gaps.
  Experimental results on ScienceBench show that SciGPT outperforms GPT-4o in
core scientific tasks including sequence labeling, generation, and inference.
It also exhibits strong robustness in unseen scientific tasks, validating its
potential to facilitate AI-augmented scientific discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型日益个性化，但人物设定提示可能导致模型错误拒绝用户请求，需要量化这种问题的严重程度。

Method: 使用15种社会人口学人物设定、16个不同模型、3个任务类型和9个提示变体进行测试，提出蒙特卡洛方法进行样本高效量化。

Result: 模型能力越强，人物设定对拒绝率的影响越小；某些社会人口学人物设定会增加虚假拒绝，但模型选择和任务类型影响更大，特别是在敏感内容任务中。

Conclusion: 人物设定效应可能被高估，虚假拒绝更多受模型能力和任务类型影响，而非人物设定本身。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into our daily lives
and personalized. However, LLM personalization might also increase unintended
side effects. Recent work suggests that persona prompting can lead models to
falsely refuse user requests. However, no work has fully quantified the extent
of this issue. To address this gap, we measure the impact of 15
sociodemographic personas (based on gender, race, religion, and disability) on
false refusal. To control for other factors, we also test 16 different models,
3 tasks (Natural Language Inference, politeness, and offensiveness
classification), and nine prompt paraphrases. We propose a Monte Carlo-based
method to quantify this issue in a sample-efficient manner. Our results show
that as models become more capable, personas impact the refusal rate less and
less. Certain sociodemographic personas increase false refusal in some models,
which suggests underlying biases in the alignment strategies or safety
mechanisms. However, we find that the model choice and task significantly
influence false refusals, especially in sensitive content tasks. Our findings
suggest that persona effects have been overestimated, and might be due to other
factors.

Abstract: Converging evidence suggests that systems of semantic categories across human
languages achieve near-optimal compression via the Information Bottleneck (IB)
complexity-accuracy principle. Large language models (LLMs) are not trained for
this objective, which raises the question: are LLMs capable of evolving

influential human behavioral studies. First, we conduct an English color-naming
study, showing that Gemini aligns well with the naming patterns of native
English speakers and achieves a significantly high IB-efficiency score, while
Llama exhibits an efficient but lower complexity system compared to English.
Second, to test whether LLMs simply mimic patterns in their training data or
actually exhibit a human-like inductive bias toward IB-efficiency, we simulate
cultural evolution of pseudo color-naming systems in LLMs via iterated
in-context language learning. We find that akin to humans, LLMs iteratively
restructure initially random systems towards greater IB-efficiency and
increased alignment with patterns observed across the world's languages. These
findings demonstrate that LLMs are capable of evolving perceptually grounded,
human-like semantic systems, driven by the same fundamental principle that
governs semantic efficiency across human languages.

TL;DR: MERLIN是一个两阶段模型堆叠框架，通过课程学习策略（从通用双语文本到任务特定数据）和仅适配少量DoRA权重，显著提升低资源语言的复杂推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有编码器-解码器方法在中等和高资源语言上表现良好，但在低资源语言上仍存在较大差距，需要提升低资源语言的复杂推理能力。

Method: 采用两阶段模型堆叠框架，应用课程学习策略（从通用双语文本到任务特定数据），仅适配少量DoRA权重。

Result: 在AfriMGSM基准上比MindMerger提升12.9个百分点，优于GPT-4o-mini；在MGSM和MSVAMP上也分别获得0.9和2.8个百分点的提升。

Conclusion: MERLIN框架在低资源和高资源环境下都表现出有效性，显著提升了低资源语言的复杂推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models excel in English but still struggle with complex
reasoning in many low-resource languages (LRLs). Existing encoder-plus-decoder
methods such as LangBridge and MindMerger raise accuracy on mid and
high-resource languages, yet they leave a large gap on LRLs. We present MERLIN,
a two-stage model-stacking framework that applies a curriculum learning
strategy -- from general bilingual bitext to task-specific data -- and adapts
only a small set of DoRA weights. On the AfriMGSM benchmark MERLIN improves
exact-match accuracy by +12.9 pp over MindMerger and outperforms GPT-4o-mini.
It also yields consistent gains on MGSM and MSVAMP (+0.9 and +2.8 pp),
demonstrating effectiveness across both low and high-resource settings.

TL;DR: 研究发现偏见可以通过提示从预训练大语言模型转移到适应模型，现有提示去偏方法无法一致防止偏见转移，需要在内在模型中纠正偏见以防止向下游任务传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究假设偏见不会从预训练LLM转移到适应模型，但本文要验证这一假设在提示适应策略下的有效性，因为提示是现实应用中极受欢迎且易得的适应方法。

Method: 研究因果模型在提示适应下的偏见转移假设，分析内在偏见与提示适应后偏见的相关性，评估不同提示去偏策略的效果。

Result: 偏见确实通过提示转移，内在偏见与适应后偏见的相关系数在性别(≥0.94)、年龄(≥0.98)、宗教(≥0.69)等维度保持中到强相关；改变少样本参数时偏见仍强相关(≥0.90)；现有去偏方法各有优势但无法一致减少偏见转移。

Conclusion: 需要在内在模型中纠正偏见和改进推理能力，以防止偏见向下游任务传播，因为提示无法有效阻止偏见转移。

Abstract: A dangerous assumption that can be made from prior work on the bias transfer
hypothesis (BTH) is that biases do not transfer from pre-trained large language
models (LLMs) to adapted models. We invalidate this assumption by studying the
BTH in causal models under prompt adaptations, as prompting is an extremely
popular and accessible adaptation strategy used in real-world applications. In
contrast to prior work, we find that biases can transfer through prompting and
that popular prompt-based mitigation methods do not consistently prevent biases
from transferring. Specifically, the correlation between intrinsic biases and
those after prompt adaptation remain moderate to strong across demographics and
tasks -- for example, gender (rho >= 0.94) in co-reference resolution, and age
(rho >= 0.98) and religion (rho >= 0.69) in question answering. Further, we
find that biases remain strongly correlated when varying few-shot composition
parameters, such as sample size, stereotypical content, occupational
distribution and representational balance (rho >= 0.90). We evaluate several
prompt-based debiasing strategies and find that different approaches have
distinct strengths, but none consistently reduce bias transfer across models,
tasks or demographics. These results demonstrate that correcting bias, and
potentially improving reasoning ability, in intrinsic models may prevent
propagation of biases to downstream tasks.

TL;DR: 提出verbalized algorithms方法，将复杂任务分解为LLM可可靠执行的简单自然语言操作，使用经典算法框架来保证理论可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统一次性查询LLM的方式不可靠，希望通过结合经典算法的理论保证和LLM的自然语言处理能力来提高推理任务的可靠性

Method: 将任务分解为简单的自然语言字符串操作，让LLM只负责这些基础操作，然后使用已知的经典算法（如位onic排序网络）来组织这些操作

Result: 在排序和聚类任务上证明了该方法的有效性

Conclusion: verbalized algorithms方法通过限制LLM的作用范围并利用经典算法的理论保证，能够提高复杂推理任务的可靠性

Abstract: Instead of querying LLMs in a one-shot manner and hoping to get the right
answer for a reasoning task, we propose a paradigm we call \emph{verbalized
algorithms} (VAs), which leverage classical algorithms with established
theoretical understanding. VAs decompose a task into simple elementary
operations on natural language strings that they should be able to answer
reliably, and limit the scope of LLMs to only those simple tasks. For example,
for sorting a series of natural language strings, \emph{verbalized sorting}
uses an LLM as a binary comparison oracle in a known and well-analyzed sorting
algorithm (e.g., bitonic sorting network). We demonstrate the effectiveness of
this approach on sorting and clustering tasks.

TL;DR: 传统标注者过滤方法在主观任务中会错误移除意见分歧的标注者而非垃圾标注者，导致准确性和标签多样性之间的次优权衡。研究发现保守的标注者移除比例（<5%）最佳，且垃圾标注者通常比非垃圾标注者更不随机。

Motivation: 机器学习数据集需要同时保留标注的多样性并过滤垃圾或低质量响应，但现有方法在平衡标注者可靠性和代表性方面存在问题。

Method: 通过经验评估一系列标注者过滤启发式方法对主观任务中变异保留的影响，并使用合成垃圾数据分析性能。

Result: 现有方法经常移除意见分歧的标注者而非垃圾标注者，保守的标注者移除设置（<5%）效果最好。垃圾标注者通常分布上与真实标注者无法区分，且倾向于给出固定答案而非随机答案。

Conclusion: 需要开发能够考虑标签多样性的垃圾过滤方法，因为垃圾标注者往往比非垃圾标注者更不随机，这与现有方法的直觉相反。

Abstract: For machine learning datasets to accurately represent diverse opinions in a
population, they must preserve variation in data labels while filtering out
spam or low-quality responses. How can we balance annotator reliability and
representation? We empirically evaluate how a range of heuristics for annotator
filtering affect the preservation of variation on subjective tasks. We find
that these methods, designed for contexts in which variation from a single
ground-truth label is considered noise, often remove annotators who disagree
instead of spam annotators, introducing suboptimal tradeoffs between accuracy
and label diversity. We find that conservative settings for annotator removal
(<5%) are best, after which all tested methods increase the mean absolute error
from the true average label. We analyze performance on synthetic spam to
observe that these methods often assume spam annotators are less random than
real spammers tend to be: most spammers are distributionally indistinguishable
from real annotators, and the minority that are distinguishable tend to give
fixed answers, not random ones. Thus, tasks requiring the preservation of
variation reverse the intuition of existing spam filtering methods: spammers
tend to be less random than non-spammers, so metrics that assume variation is
spam fare worse. These results highlight the need for spam removal methods that
account for label diversity.

Motivation: 理解不同格式文档间如何共享信息对信息检索、摘要和内容对齐任务至关重要，需要一种能够识别语义覆盖关系的方法。

Method: 采用问题回答基础方法，通过文档间共享问题的可回答性来衡量语义覆盖关系。使用SQuAD语料库构建综合性数据集，通过重写源文本和选择性省略信息来精确控制内容重叠程度。

Result: 判别模型显著超过生成方法，RoBERTa-base模型达到最高准确率61.4%，随机森林模型在宏平均F1分数上表现最佳（52.9%）。

Conclusion: 问题回答提供了有效的视角来评估不同风格文本间的语义关系，为理解当前模型如何进行深层信息推理提供了见解。

Abstract: Understanding how information is shared across documents, regardless of the
format in which it is expressed, is critical for tasks such as information
retrieval, summarization, and content alignment. In this work, we introduce a
novel framework for modelling Semantic Coverage Relations (SCR), which
classifies document pairs based on how their informational content aligns. We
define three core relation types: equivalence, where both texts convey the same
information using different textual forms or styles; inclusion, where one
document fully contains the information of another and adds more; and semantic
overlap, where each document presents partially overlapping content. To capture
these relations, we adopt a question answering (QA)-based approach, using the
answerability of shared questions across documents as an indicator of semantic
coverage. We construct a synthetic dataset derived from the SQuAD corpus by
paraphrasing source passages and selectively omitting information, enabling
precise control over content overlap. This dataset allows us to benchmark
generative language models and train transformer-based classifiers for SCR
prediction. Our findings demonstrate that discriminative models significantly
outperform generative approaches, with the RoBERTa-base model achieving the
highest accuracy of 61.4% and the Random Forest-based model showing the best
balance with a macro-F1 score of 52.9%. The results show that QA provides an
effective lens for assessing semantic relations across stylistically diverse
texts, offering insights into the capacity of current models to reason about
information beyond surface similarity. The dataset and code developed in this
study are publicly available to support reproducibility.

Result: 基于合成数据训练的模型性能始终不如基于人类数据训练的模型，联合指标性能下降高达30%，主要原因是LLM生成的有毒内容词汇多样性严重不足。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在生成有毒内容方面存在局限性，词汇重复且缺乏人类毒性的细微差别和多样性，强调了多样化人类标注数据对于构建鲁棒去毒系统的重要性。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are excellent at generating synthetic
data. However, their performance in sensitive domains such as text
detoxification has not received proper attention from the scientific community.
This paper explores the possibility of using LLM-generated synthetic toxic data
as an alternative to human-generated data for training models for
detoxification. Using Llama 3 and Qwen activation-patched models, we generated
synthetic toxic counterparts for neutral texts from ParaDetox and SST-2
datasets. Our experiments show that models fine-tuned on synthetic data
consistently perform worse than those trained on human data, with a drop in
performance of up to 30% in joint metrics. The root cause is identified as a
critical lexical diversity gap: LLMs generate toxic content using a small,
repetitive vocabulary of insults that fails to capture the nuances and variety
of human toxicity. These findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in
this domain and emphasize the continued importance of diverse, human-annotated
data for building robust detoxification systems.

Method: 使用低秩适应(LoRA)技术对LLaMA基础模型进行微调，每个任务仅使用几百到一千个样本，支持JSON提取、知识图谱提取和命名实体识别

Conclusion: 精心调优的小模型能够以极低的计算成本提供稳定准确的结构化输出，使资源受限环境中的信息提取管道变得经济高效且可靠

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) for structured data extraction in
domains such as financial compliance reporting, legal document analytics, and
multilingual knowledge base construction is often impractical for smaller teams
due to the high cost of running large architectures and the difficulty of
preparing large, high-quality datasets. Most recent instruction-tuning studies
focus on seven-billion-parameter or larger models, leaving limited evidence on
whether much smaller models can work reliably under low-resource, multi-task
conditions. This work presents ETLCH, a billion-parameter LLaMA-based model
fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation on only a few hundred to one thousand
samples per task for JSON extraction, knowledge graph extraction, and named
entity recognition. Despite its small scale, ETLCH outperforms strong baselines
across most evaluation metrics, with substantial gains observed even at the
lowest data scale. These findings demonstrate that well-tuned small models can
deliver stable and accurate structured outputs at a fraction of the
computational cost, enabling cost-effective and reliable information extraction
pipelines in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Speech Relation Extraction (SpeechRE) aims to extract relation triplets
directly from speech. However, existing benchmark datasets rely heavily on
synthetic data, lacking sufficient quantity and diversity of real human speech.
Moreover, existing models also suffer from rigid single-order generation
templates and weak semantic alignment, substantially limiting their
performance. To address these challenges, we introduce CommonVoice-SpeechRE, a
large-scale dataset comprising nearly 20,000 real-human speech samples from
diverse speakers, establishing a new benchmark for SpeechRE research.
Furthermore, we propose the Relation Prompt-Guided Multi-Order Generative
Ensemble (RPG-MoGe), a novel framework that features: (1) a multi-order triplet
generation ensemble strategy, leveraging data diversity through diverse element
orders during both training and inference, and (2) CNN-based latent relation
prediction heads that generate explicit relation prompts to guide cross-modal
alignment and accurate triplet generation. Experiments show our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing both a benchmark dataset and an
effective solution for real-world SpeechRE. The source code and dataset are
publicly available at https://github.com/NingJinzhong/SpeechRE_RPG_MoGe.

Abstract: In an era where misinformation spreads freely, fact-checking (FC) plays a
crucial role in verifying claims and promoting reliable information. While
automated fact-checking (AFC) has advanced significantly, existing systems
remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate or generate claims,
evidence, or claim-evidence pairs. These attacks can distort the truth, mislead
decision-makers, and ultimately undermine the reliability of FC models. Despite
growing research interest in adversarial attacks against AFC systems, a
comprehensive, holistic overview of key challenges remains lacking. These
challenges include understanding attack strategies, assessing the resilience of
current models, and identifying ways to enhance robustness. This survey
provides the first in-depth review of adversarial attacks targeting FC,
categorizing existing attack methodologies and evaluating their impact on AFC
systems. Additionally, we examine recent advancements in adversary-aware
defenses and highlight open research questions that require further
exploration. Our findings underscore the urgent need for resilient FC
frameworks capable of withstanding adversarial manipulations in pursuit of
preserving high verification accuracy.

Motivation: 由于人类存在肯定偏见（倾向于同意调查陈述），而LLMs基于人类数据训练且易受输入微小变化影响，因此研究LLMs是否也存在类似偏见

Method: 在不同模型、任务和语言（英语、德语、波兰语）中研究LLMs的肯定偏见表现

Result: 与人类相反，LLMs显示出倾向于回答"不"的偏见，无论这是表示同意还是不同意

Conclusion: LLMs表现出与人类不同的系统性回答模式，具有否定偏见而非肯定偏见

Abstract: Acquiescence bias, i.e. the tendency of humans to agree with statements in
surveys, independent of their actual beliefs, is well researched and
documented. Since Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be very
influenceable by relatively small changes in input and are trained on
human-generated data, it is reasonable to assume that they could show a similar
tendency. We present a study investigating the presence of acquiescence bias in
LLMs across different models, tasks, and languages (English, German, and
Polish). Our results indicate that, contrary to humans, LLMs display a bias
towards answering no, regardless of whether it indicates agreement or
disagreement.

Abstract: Persona-prompting is a growing strategy to steer LLMs toward simulating
particular perspectives or linguistic styles through the lens of a specified
identity. While this method is often used to personalize outputs, its impact on
how LLMs represent social groups remains underexplored. In this paper, we
investigate whether persona-prompting leads to different levels of linguistic
abstraction - an established marker of stereotyping - when generating short
texts linking socio-demographic categories with stereotypical or
non-stereotypical attributes. Drawing on the Linguistic Expectancy Bias
framework, we analyze outputs from six open-weight LLMs under three prompting
conditions, comparing 11 persona-driven responses to those of a generic AI
assistant. To support this analysis, we introduce Self-Stereo, a new dataset of
self-reported stereotypes from Reddit. We measure abstraction through three
metrics: concreteness, specificity, and negation. Our results highlight the
limits of persona-prompting in modulating abstraction in language, confirming
criticisms about the ecology of personas as representative of socio-demographic
groups and raising concerns about the risk of propagating stereotypes even when
seemingly evoking the voice of a marginalized group.

Motivation: 现有方法通常单独优化对齐维度，导致权衡和不一致行为；而MoE架构存在路由校准不佳的问题，限制了在对齐任务中的有效性。

Method: 提出TrinityX框架，包含分别针对HHH三个维度训练的专家，通过任务自适应的校准路由机制整合专家输出，形成统一的对齐感知表示。

Result: 在三个标准对齐基准测试中，TrinityX相比基线方法在胜率、安全性和真实性方面分别提升32.5%、33.9%和28.4%，同时内存使用和推理延迟降低40%以上。

Conclusion: TrinityX通过校准专家混合机制有效解决了LLM对齐中的多维度优化问题，具有良好的泛化能力和计算效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong performance across a wide range
of NLP tasks, yet aligning their outputs with the principles of Helpfulness,
Harmlessness, and Honesty (HHH) remains a persistent challenge. Existing
methods often optimize for individual alignment dimensions in isolation,
leading to trade-offs and inconsistent behavior. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architectures offer modularity, they suffer from poorly calibrated routing,
limiting their effectiveness in alignment tasks. We propose TrinityX, a modular
alignment framework that incorporates a Mixture of Calibrated Experts (MoCaE)
within the Transformer architecture. TrinityX leverages separately trained
experts for each HHH dimension, integrating their outputs through a calibrated,
task-adaptive routing mechanism that combines expert signals into a unified,
alignment-aware representation. Extensive experiments on three standard
alignment benchmarks-Alpaca (Helpfulness), BeaverTails (Harmlessness), and
TruthfulQA (Honesty)-demonstrate that TrinityX outperforms strong baselines,
achieving relative improvements of 32.5% in win rate, 33.9% in safety score,
and 28.4% in truthfulness. In addition, TrinityX reduces memory usage and
inference latency by over 40% compared to prior MoE-based approaches. Ablation
studies highlight the importance of calibrated routing, and cross-model
evaluations confirm TrinityX's generalization across diverse LLM backbones.

Conclusion: 构建高质量偏好数据对多语言对齐至关重要

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) generally show a significant performance
gap in alignment between English and other languages. To bridge this gap,
existing research typically leverages the model's responses in English as a
reference to select the best/worst responses in other languages, which are then
used for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training. However, we argue that
there are two limitations in the current methods that result in noisy
multilingual preference data and further limited alignment performance: 1) Not
all English responses are of high quality, and using a response with low
quality may mislead the alignment for other languages. 2) Current methods
usually use biased or heuristic approaches to construct multilingual preference
pairs. To address these limitations, we design a consistency-based data
selection method to construct high-quality multilingual preference data for
improving multilingual alignment (CM-Align). Specifically, our method includes
two parts: consistency-guided English reference selection and cross-lingual
consistency-based multilingual preference data construction. Experimental
results on three LLMs and three common tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our method, which further indicates the necessity of
constructing high-quality preference data.

Motivation: 生物医学问答面临短语专业知识、数据量大复杂、更新快速等挑战，需要准确的知识提取和解释能力。研究考虑如何利用LLM进行信息检索，并通过集成方法在不需精调或标签数据的情况下实现领先性能。

Method: 采用多个LLM模型（包括Anthropic和Google的模型）的集成方法，通过聚合各模型输出来生成更准确和稳健的答案。结合有效的检索增强生成（RAG）流程，重点关注上下文长度对性能的影响。在BioASQ挑战任务上进行评估。

Result: 集成方法在生物医学Yes/No问答任务上超过了单个LLM的性能，在某些情况下甚至能够比较或超过领域特化系统。发现上下文长度与性能存在关联：扩大上下文虽能提供更多证据，但也可能导致信息淀洒和模型迷失方向。

Conclusion: 集成基于零检验的方法结合有效的RAG流程，为生物医学问答提供了一种实用且可扩展的替代方案，可以避免成本高昂的精调和标签数据需求。准确、聚焦的信息检索在RAG方法中仍然至关重要，确保LLM在相关信息范围内生成答案。

Abstract: Biomedical question answering (QA) poses significant challenges due to the
need for precise interpretation of specialized knowledge drawn from a vast,
complex, and rapidly evolving corpus. In this work, we explore how large
language models (LLMs) can be used for information retrieval (IR), and an
ensemble of zero-shot models can accomplish state-of-the-art performance on a
domain-specific Yes/No QA task. Evaluating our approach on the BioASQ challenge
tasks, we show that ensembles can outperform individual LLMs and in some cases
rival or surpass domain-tuned systems - all while preserving generalizability
and avoiding the need for costly fine-tuning or labeled data. Our method
aggregates outputs from multiple LLM variants, including models from Anthropic
and Google, to synthesize more accurate and robust answers. Moreover, our
investigation highlights a relationship between context length and performance:
while expanded contexts are meant to provide valuable evidence, they
simultaneously risk information dilution and model disorientation. These
findings emphasize IR as a critical foundation in Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) approaches for biomedical QA systems. Precise, focused
retrieval remains essential for ensuring LLMs operate within relevant
information boundaries when generating answers from retrieved documents. Our
results establish that ensemble-based zero-shot approaches, when paired with
effective RAG pipelines, constitute a practical and scalable alternative to
domain-tuned systems for biomedical question answering.

TL;DR: 大语言模型在医学领域存在显著的记忆现象，这种记忆比普通领域更为普遍且可分为有益、无信息和有害三类。研究给出了实用建议来促进有益记忆、减少无信息记忆和减轻有害记忆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在医学领域应用广泛，但对其记忆医学训练数据的程度和影响仍不明确，需要系统评估记忆现象的普遍性、特征、量级和潜在影响。

Method: 系统分析了三种常见适配场景：(1)医学语料库的续预训练，(2)标准医学测试集的微调，(3)真实临床数据的微调（包含超13,000份独特患者记录）。

Result: 记忆现象在所有适配场景中都很普遍，显著高于普通领域。记忆可分为三类：有益记忆（例如准确回忆临床指南）、无信息记忆（模板化语言）和有害记忆（敏感临床信息泄漏）。

Conclusion: 记忆现象影响LLMs在医学领域的发展和采用。研究提出实用建议：促进有益记忆提升领域特定理解和事实准确性，减少无信息记忆促进深层学习，减轻有害记忆防止敏感患者信息泄漏。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in
medicine. To date, LLMs have been widely applied to tasks such as diagnostic
assistance, medical question answering, and clinical information synthesis.
However, a key open question remains: to what extent do LLMs memorize medical
training data. In this study, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of
memorization of LLMs in medicine, assessing its prevalence (how frequently it
occurs), characteristics (what is memorized), volume (how much content is
memorized), and potential downstream impacts (how memorization may affect
medical applications). We systematically analyze common adaptation scenarios:
(1) continued pretraining on medical corpora, (2) fine-tuning on standard
medical benchmarks, and (3) fine-tuning on real-world clinical data, including
over 13,000 unique inpatient records from Yale New Haven Health System. The
results demonstrate that memorization is prevalent across all adaptation
scenarios and significantly higher than reported in the general domain.
Memorization affects both the development and adoption of LLMs in medicine and
can be categorized into three types: beneficial (e.g., accurate recall of
clinical guidelines and biomedical references), uninformative (e.g., repeated
disclaimers or templated medical document language), and harmful (e.g.,
regeneration of dataset-specific or sensitive clinical content). Based on these
findings, we offer practical recommendations to facilitate beneficial
memorization that enhances domain-specific reasoning and factual accuracy,
minimize uninformative memorization to promote deeper learning beyond
surface-level patterns, and mitigate harmful memorization to prevent the
leakage of sensitive or identifiable patient information.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出OTESGN模型，通过句法-语义协同注意力机制和最优传输技术，有效解决ABSA任务中复杂语义关系建模和噪声干扰问题，在多个基准测试中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于句法树和方面感知注意力的方法难以建模复杂语义关系，线性点积特征无法捕捉非线性关联，导致无关词汇的噪声相似性掩盖关键观点词。

Method: 提出最优传输增强的句法-语义图网络(OTESGN)，包含句法图感知注意力挖掘潜在句法依赖关系，语义最优传输注意力发现细粒度语义对齐，自适应注意力融合模块整合异构特征，并使用对比正则化提升鲁棒性。

Result: 在Twitter数据集上F1分数提升1.01%，在Laptop14数据集上F1分数提升1.30%，达到最先进水平。消融研究和可视化分析验证了其在观点词精确定位和抗噪方面的有效性。

Conclusion: OTESGN通过句法-语义协同建模和最优传输技术，能够有效捕捉被无关词汇掩盖的情感信号，在方面级情感分析任务中表现出优异的性能。

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to identify aspect terms and
determine their sentiment polarity. While dependency trees combined with
contextual semantics effectively identify aspect sentiment, existing methods
relying on syntax trees and aspect-aware attention struggle to model complex
semantic relationships. Their dependence on linear dot-product features fails
to capture nonlinear associations, allowing noisy similarity from irrelevant
words to obscure key opinion terms. Motivated by Differentiable Optimal
Matching, we propose the Optimal Transport Enhanced Syntactic-Semantic Graph
Network (OTESGN), which introduces a Syntactic-Semantic Collaborative
Attention. It comprises a Syntactic Graph-Aware Attention for mining latent
syntactic dependencies and modeling global syntactic topology, as well as a
Semantic Optimal Transport Attention designed to uncover fine-grained semantic
alignments amidst textual noise, thereby accurately capturing sentiment signals
obscured by irrelevant tokens. A Adaptive Attention Fusion module integrates
these heterogeneous features, and contrastive regularization further improves
robustness. Experiments demonstrate that OTESGN achieves state-of-the-art
results, outperforming previous best models by +1.01% F1 on Twitter and +1.30%
F1 on Laptop14 benchmarks. Ablative studies and visual analyses corroborate its
efficacy in precise localization of opinion words and noise resistance.

TL;DR: X-Teaming Evolutionary M2S是一个自动化框架，通过语言模型引导的进化来发现和优化多轮到单轮(M2S)压缩模板，实现了44.8%的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的M2S压缩方法依赖少量手动编写的模板，需要自动化方法来发现和优化更有效的单轮探测模板。

Method: 使用语言模型引导的进化框架，结合智能采样和LLM作为评判者，通过设置成功阈值θ=0.70进行多代进化。

Result: 获得了5个进化世代、2个新模板家族，在GPT-4.1上达到44.8%总体成功率(103/230)，结构增益可跨模型迁移但存在差异。

Conclusion: 结构级搜索是可复现的强化单轮探测的有效途径，强调了阈值校准和跨模型评估的重要性。

Abstract: Multi-turn-to-single-turn (M2S) compresses iterative red-teaming into one
structured prompt, but prior work relied on a handful of manually written
templates. We present X-Teaming Evolutionary M2S, an automated framework that
discovers and optimizes M2S templates through language-model-guided evolution.
The system pairs smart sampling from 12 sources with an LLM-as-judge inspired
by StrongREJECT and records fully auditable logs.
  Maintaining selection pressure by setting the success threshold to $\theta =
0.70$, we obtain five evolutionary generations, two new template families, and
44.8% overall success (103/230) on GPT-4.1. A balanced cross-model panel of
2,500 trials (judge fixed) shows that structural gains transfer but vary by
target; two models score zero at the same threshold. We also find a positive
coupling between prompt length and score, motivating length-aware judging.
  Our results demonstrate that structure-level search is a reproducible route
to stronger single-turn probes and underscore the importance of threshold
calibration and cross-model evaluation. Code, configurations, and artifacts are
available at https://github.com/hyunjun1121/M2S-x-teaming.

TL;DR: DSM是一种流式多模态序列到序列学习框架，通过引入延迟对齐机制，使用仅解码器语言模型处理时间对齐的流数据，在保持流式推理的同时支持任意长度序列处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统序列到序列生成要么是离线处理（完整输入后输出），要么需要学习复杂的流控制策略。DSM旨在提供一种更灵活、统一的流式多模态序列建模方法。

Method: 将流对齐作为预处理步骤，在不同流之间引入适当延迟，使用仅解码器语言模型处理时间对齐的多模态流数据。

Result: 在自动语音识别和文本到语音合成任务上取得state-of-the-art性能，支持任意长序列处理，延迟表现优异，甚至可与离线基线竞争。

Conclusion: DSM提供了一个通用、灵活的流式多模态序列建模框架，在多个重要任务上表现出色，具有很好的应用前景。

Abstract: We introduce Delayed Streams Modeling (DSM), a flexible formulation for
streaming, multimodal sequence-to-sequence learning. Sequence-to-sequence
generation is often cast in an offline manner, where the model consumes the
complete input sequence before generating the first output timestep.
Alternatively, streaming sequence-to-sequence rely on learning a policy for
choosing when to advance on the input stream, or write to the output stream.
DSM instead models already time-aligned streams with a decoder-only language
model. By moving the alignment to a pre-processing step,and introducing
appropriate delays between streams, DSM provides streaming inference of
arbitrary output sequences, from any input combination, making it applicable to
many sequence-to-sequence problems. In particular, given text and audio
streams, automatic speech recognition (ASR) corresponds to the text stream
being delayed, while the opposite gives a text-to-speech (TTS) model. We
perform extensive experiments for these two major sequence-to-sequence tasks,
showing that DSM provides state-of-the-art performance and latency while
supporting arbitrary long sequences, being even competitive with offline
baselines. Code, samples and demos are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现不同自回归Transformer架构在事实回忆机制上存在显著差异，特别是Qwen模型在早期层中注意力模块比MLP模块对事实回忆贡献更大


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解Transformer语言模型如何存储和检索事实关联对于提高可解释性和实现针对性模型编辑至关重要，需要验证先前在GPT模型上的发现是否适用于其他自回归架构

Method: 对多个模型（GPT、LLaMA、Qwen、DeepSeek）进行全面的事实回忆评估，分析事实信息在何处以及如何被编码和访问

Result: 发现Qwen模型的行为模式与先前不同：在最早层中，注意力模块比MLP模块对事实回忆的贡献更大

Conclusion: 即使在自回归Transformer家族内部，架构变化也会导致根本不同的事实回忆机制，这表明需要针对不同架构进行特定的模型分析和编辑策略

Abstract: Understanding how Transformer-based language models store and retrieve
factual associations is critical for improving interpretability and enabling
targeted model editing. Prior work, primarily on GPT-style models, has
identified MLP modules in early layers as key contributors to factual recall.
However, it remains unclear whether these findings generalize across different
autoregressive architectures. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of factual recall across several models -- including GPT, LLaMA,
Qwen, and DeepSeek -- analyzing where and how factual information is encoded
and accessed. Consequently, we find that Qwen-based models behave differently
from previous patterns: attention modules in the earliest layers contribute
more to factual recall than MLP modules. Our findings suggest that even within
the autoregressive Transformer family, architectural variations can lead to
fundamentally different mechanisms of factual recall.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的自动注解模式，通过学生模型与噪声教师(LLM)协作，在无监督环境中评估和提升注解质量，并提出了CAI比率作为无监督评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在动态、无监督环境中评估LLM注解质量的挑战，因为传统方法需要大量标准数据和人工反馈，而这在实际应用中缺乏。

Method: 提出了一种自主注解范式，让学生模型作为无监督反馈机制，采用用户偏好基于多数投票策略来评估LLM输出的一致性，并提出CAI比率指标来量化注解质量。

Result: 在10个开放域NLP数据集和4个LLM上进行实验，CAI比率与LLM准确性呈现强正相关关系，证明其在无监督环境中的有效性。

Conclusion: CAI比率是一个重要的无监督评估工具，能够在实际应用场景中有效评估LLM注解质量并进行模型选择，解决了传统方法在动态无监督环境中的限制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), when paired with prompt-based tasks, have
significantly reduced data annotation costs and reliance on human annotators.
However, evaluating the quality of their annotations remains challenging in
dynamic, unsupervised environments where oracle feedback is scarce and
conventional methods fail. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
agentic annotation paradigm, where a student model collaborates with a noisy
teacher (the LLM) to assess and refine annotation quality without relying on
oracle feedback. The student model, acting as an unsupervised feedback
mechanism, employs a user preference-based majority voting strategy to evaluate
the consistency of the LLM outputs. To systematically measure the reliability
of LLM-generated annotations, we introduce the Consistent and Inconsistent
(CAI) Ratio, a novel unsupervised evaluation metric. The CAI Ratio not only
quantifies the annotation quality of the noisy teacher under limited user
preferences but also plays a critical role in model selection, enabling the
identification of robust LLMs in dynamic, unsupervised environments. Applied to
ten open-domain NLP datasets across four LLMs, the CAI Ratio demonstrates a
strong positive correlation with LLM accuracy, establishing it as an essential
tool for unsupervised evaluation and model selection in real-world settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决子词分词方法在低资源、形态复杂语言（如Geez文字语言）中无法保持形态边界的问题

Method: 结合基于语素和BPE的混合分词方法，构建MoVoC-Tok分词器，整合监督形态分析到子词词汇表

Result: 在自动翻译质量上没有显著提升，但在内在指标MorphoScore和边界精度上有持续改进，提高了语言保真度和标记效率

Conclusion: 形态感知分词在增强语言保真度方面具有价值，发布了四个Geez文字语言的形态标注数据集和分词器以支持进一步研究

Abstract: Subword-based tokenization methods often fail to preserve morphological
boundaries, a limitation especially pronounced in low-resource, morphologically
complex languages such as those written in the Geez script. To address this, we
present MoVoC (Morpheme-aware Subword Vocabulary Construction) and train
MoVoC-Tok, a tokenizer that integrates supervised morphological analysis into
the subword vocabulary. This hybrid segmentation approach combines
morpheme-based and Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokens to preserve morphological
integrity while maintaining lexical meaning. To tackle resource scarcity, we
curate and release manually annotated morpheme data for four Geez script
languages and a morpheme-aware vocabulary for two of them. While the proposed
tokenization method does not lead to significant gains in automatic translation
quality, we observe consistent improvements in intrinsic metrics, MorphoScore,
and Boundary Precision, highlighting the value of morphology-aware segmentation
in enhancing linguistic fidelity and token efficiency. Our morpheme-annotated
datasets and tokenizer will be publicly available to support further research
in low-resource, morphologically rich languages. Our code and data are

Motivation: 现有研究主要集中在英语语料库构建，缺乏对其他语言有效训练语料库构建方法的理解，特别是在从英语模型迁移到其他语言时的数据选择策略。

Method: 采用可扩展的网络语料库构建方法，建立1.2亿token的葡萄牙语语料库；使用持续预训练设置，研究不同数据选择和预处理策略；应用语言特定的过滤管道，包括教育、STEM内容和有毒内容分类器。

Result: 构建的葡萄牙语语料库达到工业级语料库的竞争性结果；语言适应化处理显著提升模型性能；证明了高质量语言特定数据的重要性。

Conclusion: 研究展示了语言特定过滤管道在构建多语言LLM训练语料库中的价值，方法可推广到其他语言，为多语言LLM开发提供了重要见解。

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is deeply influenced by the
quality and composition of their training data. While much of the existing work
has centered on English, there remains a gap in understanding how to construct
effective training corpora for other languages. We explore scalable methods for
building web-based corpora for LLMs. We apply them to build a new 120B token
corpus in Portuguese that achieves competitive results to an industrial-grade
corpus. Using a continual pretraining setup, we study how different data
selection and preprocessing strategies affect LLM performance when
transitioning a model originally trained in English to another language. Our
findings demonstrate the value of language-specific filtering pipelines,
including classifiers for education, science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics (STEM), as well as toxic content. We show that adapting a model to
the target language leads to performance improvements, reinforcing the
importance of high-quality, language-specific data. While our case study
focuses on Portuguese, our methods are applicable to other languages, offering
insights for multilingual LLM development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别LLM在社会科学研究中存在的风险，量化不同研究选择对统计结论的影响，提高研究可靠性。

Method: 复现21项已发表研究的37个数据标注任务，使用18个不同LLM模型，分析2,361个偏向测试，量化研究选择对统计结论的影响。

Result: 约1/3偏向测试中发现错误结论（先进模型），小模型中达1/2。高任务性能和模型能力能降低风险，但不能完全消除。人工标注有助减少偏差，常见校正技术效果有限。

Conclusion: LLM hacking风险实际存在，需要更严格的验证措施。敏感结果应重点检查，人工标注对提高可靠性至关重要。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming social science research
by enabling the automation of labor-intensive tasks like data annotation and
text analysis. However, LLM outputs vary significantly depending on the
implementation choices made by researchers (e.g., model selection, prompting
strategy, or temperature settings). Such variation can introduce systematic
biases and random errors, which propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type
I, Type II, Type S, or Type M errors. We call this LLM hacking.
  We quantify the risk of LLM hacking by replicating 37 data annotation tasks
from 21 published social science research studies with 18 different models.
Analyzing 13 million LLM labels, we test 2,361 realistic hypotheses to measure
how plausible researcher choices affect statistical conclusions. We find
incorrect conclusions based on LLM-annotated data in approximately one in three
hypotheses for state-of-the-art models, and in half the hypotheses for small
language models. While our findings show that higher task performance and
better general model capabilities reduce LLM hacking risk, even highly accurate
models do not completely eliminate it. The risk of LLM hacking decreases as
effect sizes increase, indicating the need for more rigorous verification of
findings near significance thresholds. Our extensive analysis of LLM hacking
mitigation techniques emphasizes the importance of human annotations in
reducing false positive findings and improving model selection. Surprisingly,
common regression estimator correction techniques are largely ineffective in
reducing LLM hacking risk, as they heavily trade off Type I vs. Type II errors.
  Beyond accidental errors, we find that intentional LLM hacking is
unacceptably simple. With few LLMs and just a handful of prompt paraphrases,
anything can be presented as statistically significant.

Abstract: In this paper, we survey recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for
reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). RL has achieved remarkable success
in advancing the frontier of LLM capabilities, particularly in addressing
complex logical tasks such as mathematics and coding. As a result, RL has
emerged as a foundational methodology for transforming LLMs into LRMs. With the
rapid progress of the field, further scaling of RL for LRMs now faces
foundational challenges not only in computational resources but also in
algorithm design, training data, and infrastructure. To this end, it is timely
to revisit the development of this domain, reassess its trajectory, and explore
strategies to enhance the scalability of RL toward Artificial SuperIntelligence
(ASI). In particular, we examine research applying RL to LLMs and LRMs for
reasoning abilities, especially since the release of DeepSeek-R1, including
foundational components, core problems, training resources, and downstream
applications, to identify future opportunities and directions for this rapidly
evolving area. We hope this review will promote future research on RL for
broader reasoning models. Github:

Abstract: We develop a unified framework for nonlinear subdivision schemes on complete
metric spaces (CMS). We begin with CMS preliminaries and formalize refinement
in CMS, retaining key structural properties, such as locality. We prove a
convergence theorem under contractivity and demonstrate its applicability. To
address schemes where contractivity is unknown, we introduce two notions of
proximity. Our proximity methods relate a nonlinear scheme to another nonlinear
scheme with known contractivity, rather than to a linear scheme, as in much of
the literature. Specifically, the first type proximity compares the two schemes
after a single refinement step and, as in the classical theory, yields
convergence from sufficiently dense initial data. The proximity of the second
type monitors alignment across all refinement levels and provides strong
convergence without density assumptions. We formulate and prove the
corresponding theorems, and illustrate them with various examples, such as
schemes over metric spaces of compact sets in $\R^n$ and schemes over the
Wasserstein space, as well as a geometric Hermite metric space. These results
extend subdivision theory beyond Euclidean and manifold-valued data for data in
metric spaces.

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂几何域提供了自动化的几何风格多重网格求解方案，扩展了几何多重网格的应用范围

Abstract: For domains that are easily represented by structured meshes, robust
geometric multigrid solvers can quickly provide the numerical solution to many
discretized elliptic PDEs. However, for complicated domains with unstructured
meshes, constructing suitable hierarchies of meshes becomes challenging. We
propose a framework for mapping computations from such complex domains to
regular computational domains via diffeomorphisms, enabling the use of robust
geometric-style multigrid. This mapping facilitates regular memory accesses
during solves, improving efficiency and scalability, especially on massively
parallel processors such as GPUs. Moreover, we show that the diffeomorphic
mapping itself may be approximately learned using an invertible neural network,
facilitating automated application to geometries where no analytic mapping is
readily available.

Abstract: A family of explicit modified Euler methods (MEMs) is constructed for
long-time approximations of super-linear SODEs driven by multiplicative noise.
The proposed schemes can preserve the same Lyapunov structure as the continuous

error bound between the law of the numerical approximation and the target
distribution in Wasserstein-1 ($\mathcal{W}_1$) distance through a
time-independent weak convergence rate for the proposed schemes. As a
by-product of this weak error estimate, we obtain an $\mathcal{O}(\tau|\ln
\tau|)$ convergence rate between the exact and numerical invariant measures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有WENO3-Z改进方案无法处理网格区间内任意位置的一阶临界点(CP1)，导致无法保持三阶精度，且大多数改进方案使用较大的指数p，影响数值分辨率。

Method: 提出精度优化引理构建满足特定条件的局部和全局光滑度指示器，使用p=1推导新的非线性权重；提出分辨率优化引理分析参数与分辨率关系，平衡数值分辨率和鲁棒性确定自由参数。

Result: WENO3-ZES4新方案在CP1情况下始终保持三阶精度（无论临界点位置），具有良好的分辨率和鲁棒性，1D和2D验证测试结果一致。

Conclusion: WENO3-ZES4成功解决了WENO3-Z在临界点的阶数退化问题，在保持计算精度的同时提升了数值性能，为WENO类格式的改进提供了有效方法。

Abstract: To address the order degradation at critical points in the WENO3-Z scheme,
some improvements have been proposed , but these approaches generally fail to
consider the occurrence of critical points at arbitrary positions within grid
intervals, resulting in their inability to maintain third-order accuracy when a
first-order critical point (CP1) occurs. Also, most previous improved schemes
suffer from a relatively large exponent p of the ratio of global to local
smoothness indicators, which adversely affects the numerical resolution.
Concerning these limitations, introduced here is an accuracy-optimization lemma
demonstrating that the accuracy of nonlinear weights can be enhanced providing
that smoothness indicators satisfy specific conditions, thereby establishing a
methodology for elevating the accuracy of nonlinear weights. Leveraging this
lemma, a local smoothness indicator is constructed with error terms achieving
second-order in smooth regions and fourth-order at CP1, alongside a global
smoothness indicator yielding fourth-order accuracy in smooth regions and
fifth-order at CP1, enabling the derivation of new nonlinear weights that meet
accuracy requirements even when employing p=1. Furthermore, a
resolution-optimization lemma is proposed to analyze the relationship between
parameters in local smoothness indicators and resolution. By integrating
theoretical analysis with numerical practices, free parameters in
non-normalized weights and local smoothness indicators are determined under the
balance of numerical resolution and robustness, which leads to the development
of WENO3-ZES4, a new WENO3-Z improvement that preserves the optimal order at
CP1 especially with p=1. 1D and 2D validating tests show that the new scheme
consistently achieves third-order in the case of CP1 regardless of its position
and exhibits good resolution as well as preferable robustness.

Conclusion: 提出的重启算法有效解决了数值流迭代方法在大时间步数下的计算效率问题，在保持原有优点的同时显著提升了计算性能。

Abstract: The numerical flow iteration method has recently been proposed as a
memory-slim solution method for the Vlasov-Poisson equation. It stores the
temporal evolution of the electric field and reconstructs the solution in each
time step by following the characteristics backwards in time and reconstructing
the solution from the initial distribution. If the number of time steps gets
large, the computational cost of this reconstruction may get prohibitive. Given
a representation of the intermediate solution, the time intervals over which
the characteristic curves need to be solved backwards in time can be reduced by
restarting the numerical flow iteration after certain time intervals. In this
paper, we propose an algorithm that reconstructs a low-rank representation of
the solution at the restart times using the blackbox approximation. The
proposed algorithm reduces the computational complexity compared to the pure
numerical flow iteration from quadratic to linear in the number of times step
while still keeping its memory complexity. On the other hand, our numerical
results demonstrate that the methods preserves the property of the numerical
flow iteration of showing much less dissipation of filaments compared to the
semi-Lagrangian method.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效处理动态网格修改的时空自适应问题，为波动问题的数值模拟提供了可靠的后验误差估计框架。

Abstract: We establish rigorous \emph{a posteriori} error bounds for a space-time
finite element method of arbitrary order discretising linear wave problems in
second order formulation. The method combines standard finite elements in space
and continuous piecewise polynomials in time with an upwind discontinuous
Galerkin-type approximation for the second temporal derivative. The proposed
scheme accepts dynamic mesh modification, as required by space-time adaptive
algorithms, resulting in a discontinuous temporal discretisation when mesh
changes occur. We prove \emph{a posteriori} error bounds in the
$L^\infty(L^2)$-norm, using carefully designed temporal and spatial
reconstructions; explicit control on the constants (including the spatial and
temporal orders of the method) in those error bounds is shown. The convergence
behaviour of an error estimator is verified numerically, also taking into
account the effect of the mesh change. A space-time adaptive algorithm is
proposed and tested numerically.

Abstract: The bilinear form u^\top f(A) v of matrix functions appears in many
application problems, where u, v \in R^n\), A \in R^{n * n}\), and f(z) is a
given analytic function.The IDR(s) method effectively reduces computational
complexity and storage requirements by introducing dimension reduction
techniques, while maintaining the numerical stability of the algorithm. This
paper studies the numerical algorithm and posterior error estimation for the
matrix function bilinear form u^{\top} f(A) v based on the IDR(s) method.
Through the error analysis of the IDR(s) algorithm, the corresponding error
expansion is derived, and it is verified that the leading term of the error
expansion serves as a reliable posterior error estimate. Based on this, in this
paper a corresponding stopping criterion is proposed. This approach is
dedicated to improving computational efficiency, especially by showing
excellent performance in handling ill-posed and large-scale problems.

Conclusion: 该方法为实时凹块CT重建提供了高效解决方案，特别适用于循环CT扫描中只有局部变化的应用场景

Abstract: This work introduces a new efficient iterative solver for the reconstruction
of real-time cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), which is based on the Prior
Image Constrained Compressed Sensing (PICCS) regularization and leverages the
efficiency of Krylov subspace methods. In particular, we focus on the setting
where a sequence of under-sampled CT scans are taken on the same object with
only local changes (e.g. changes in a tumour size or the introduction of a
surgical tool). This is very common, for example, in image-guided surgery,
where the amount of measurements is limited to ensure the safety of the
patient. In this case, we can also typically assume that a (good) initial
reconstruction for the solution exists, coming from a previously over-sampled
scan, so we can use this information to aid the subsequent reconstructions. The
effectiveness of this method is demonstrated in both a synthetic scan and using
real CT data, where it can be observed that the PICCS framework is very
effective for the reduction of artifacts, and that the new method is faster
than other common alternatives used in the same setting.

Result: 成功构建了等价系统，证明了当测试空间足够大时，后验条件能够保证Galerkin近似的拟最优性，绕过了传统inf-sup条件的限制。

Conclusion: 该方法为处理具有Lipschitz连续强单调算子的抛物型方程提供了有效框架，通过后验条件确保了数值解的拟最优性，具有重要的理论和应用价值。

Abstract: We consider parabolic evolution equations with Lipschitz continuous and
strongly monotone spatial operators. By introducing an additional variable, we
construct an equivalent system where the operator is a Lipschitz continuous
mapping from a Hilbert space $Y \times X$ to its dual, with a Lipschitz
continuous inverse. Resulting Galerkin discretizations can be solved with an
inexact Uzawa type algorithm. Quasi-optimality of the Galerkin approximations
is guaranteed under an inf-sup condition on the selected `test' and `trial'
subspaces of $Y$ and $X$. To circumvent the restriction imposed by this inf-sup
condition, an a posteriori condition for quasi-optimality is developed that is
shown to be satisfied whenever the test space is sufficiently large.

Abstract: The extended-domain method is an appealingly simple strategy for applying
spectral methods to complex geometries, but its theoretical stability
properties, particularly for non-normal operators, are not fully understood.
This paper provides a rigorous stability analysis based on the Lebesgue
constant and reveals a fundamental stability dichotomy at the heart of the
method. We first prove a surprising result: for the self-adjoint Poisson
equation, the method is unstable, with a Lebesgue constant that grows
super-polynomially due to the ill-conditioning of spectral differentiation. In
stark contrast, we prove that for the non-self-adjoint convection-diffusion
equation, the method becomes stable. We show that the first-order convection
term regularizes the operator, leading to a provably polynomial bound on the
Lebesgue constant. These results, extended here to multiple dimensions and
variable coefficients, provide a complete theoretical foundation for this
practical method, establishing the precise conditions under which it is stable
and highlighting a non-trivial interplay between operator components.

Abstract: We introduce discontinuous spectral-element methods of arbitrary order that
are well balanced, conservative of mass, and conservative or dissipative of
total energy (i.e., a mathematical entropy function) for a covariant flux
formulation of the rotating shallow water equations with variable bottom
topography on curved manifolds such as the sphere. The proposed methods are
based on a skew-symmetric splitting of the tensor divergence in covariant form,
which we implement and analyze within a general flux-differencing framework
using tensor-product summation-by-parts operators. Such schemes are proven to
satisfy semi-discrete mass and energy conservation on general unstructured
quadrilateral grids in addition to well balancing for arbitrary continuous
bottom topographies, with energy dissipation resulting from a suitable choice
of numerical interface flux. Furthermore, the proposed covariant formulation
permits an analytical representation of the geometry and associated metric
terms while satisfying the aforementioned entropy stability, conservation, and
well-balancing properties without the need to approximate the metric terms so
as to enforce discrete metric identities. Numerical experiments on cubed-sphere
grids are presented in order to verify the schemes' structure-preservation
properties as well as to assess their accuracy and robustness within the
context of several standard test cases characteristic of idealized atmospheric
flows. Our theoretical and numerical results support the further development of
the proposed methodology towards a full dynamical core for numerical weather
prediction and climate modelling, as well as broader applications to other
hyperbolic and advection-dominated systems of partial differential equations on
curved manifolds.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the rectilinear displacement and deformation of
a highly viscous, miscible circular blob influenced by a less viscous fluid
within a homogeneous porous medium featuring physically realistic no-flux
boundaries. We utilize a fourth-order accurate compact finite difference scheme
for the spatial discretization of the nonlinear partial differential equations
that govern this phenomenon. The resulting semi-discrete equations are then
integrated using the second-order Crank-Nicolson (CN) method. We conduct
numerical simulations for a P\'eclet number ($Pe \leq 3000$) and a log-mobility
ratio $0 \leq R \leq 7$, which reveal three distinct pattern formations:
comet-shape, lump-shape, and viscous fingering instability. Our results
demonstrate that the deformation, spreading, and mixing of the blob vary
non-ideally with both $Pe$ and $R$, a behavior attributed to the blob's initial
curvature. Consequently, enhanced mixing can be achieved at intermediate values
of $Pe$ and $R$, suggesting the existence of an optimal mixing condition. These
findings have significant implications for fields such as oil recovery, CO$_2$
sequestration, pollution remediation, and chromatography separation.

Abstract: Achieving clean combustion systems is crucial in terms of solving

Traditional combustion modeling techniques via computational fluid dynamics

Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as a new framework, merges physical laws with

Motivation: 探索凝胶过程对于非牛顿液滴在反应性液体表面早期展布动力学的影响机制

Method: 采用实验方法，考虑不同生物聚合物和凝胶剂浓度、击中速度，并通过3D数值模拟（变分多尺度方法）进行验证和对比分析

Result: 得到了理论论证，明确了凝胶效应对液滴最大展布的关键影响

Abstract: We report in this experimental and numerical study effects of gelation on the
early-time spreading ($<$ 10ms) of millimetric non-Newtonian drops of
biopolymer and particle suspensions impacting a Newtonian liquid containing
reactive compounds. Our analyses are initially conducted through experiments by
considering a variety of biopolymer and gelling compound concentrations, and
impact velocities. The experimental results are then compared to
three-dimensional numerical simulations based on a variational multiscale
approach, which focuses on the impact of simple viscoplastic drops on a liquid
bath in the absence of gelation (non-reactive liquid). These comparisons enable
the development of theoretical arguments that emphasise relevant gelation
effects on the drop's maximum spreading.

TL;DR: 研究分析了8排翅片管换热器在不同流速下各排管的热性能差异，发现第1、2、8排的热传递效率显著高于其他排，并建立了各排的努塞尔数关联式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究翅片管换热器各排管的差异化热性能，以优化换热器设计，降低资本成本和运行成本。

Method: 采用计算流体动力学（CFD）模拟方法，在2.5-10 ms-1流速范围内系统分析8排翅片管换热器的热工水力特性。

Result: 在特定流速条件下，第1、2、8排管的努塞尔数比其他排高15-25%，并确定了各排的努塞尔数关联式，揭示了边界层发展、尾流干扰和涡旋脱落等流动机制的影响。

Conclusion: 研究结果可用于双优化：通过减少排数降低资本成本，通过降低压降减少运行成本，为换热器优化设计提供重要依据。

Abstract: This paper investigates and characterizes the row dependent thermal
performance of an 8 row finned tube heat exchanger (HEX) with an offset tube
arrangement and continuous flat fins. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
simulations reveal distinct hydraulic thermal behavior across the tube rows,
with the first, second, and eighth rows exhibiting significantly higher heat
transfer efficiency than the average for the entire HEX under specific flow
conditions. At air velocities below 3 ms-1, the first rows exhibit increased
efficiency, while the eighth row exhibits comparatively better efficiency at
velocities exceeding 6 ms-1. In the fitted range (2.5 to 10 ms-1), orders 1, 2,
and 8 outperform orders 3 to 7 by approximately 15 to 25% in Nusselt number,
indicating that orders 1, 2, and 8 operate under distinct flow and thermal
conditions. The study also determined individual Nusselt number correlations
for each order through systematic simulations over the velocity range from 2.5
to 10 ms-1. The analysis further linked these changes to specific flow
mechanisms, such as boundary layer development, wake interference, and vortex
shedding, which govern the distinct thermal behavior of the first, second, and
last orders. These findings can enable dual optimization: lower capital costs
by minimizing the number of orders for the target thermal performance, and
lower operating costs by reducing pressure drop (reducing fan power).

Motivation: 研究Brinkman流体中靠近壁面的点力产生的流场特性，为理解诸如纤毛摆动等生物物理现象提供理论基础。

Method: 通过闭式解和单积分形式获得一般解，在远场和近场极限下进行泰勒级数展开，将流场表示为源多极子奇点级数加壁面附近解析修正项。

Result: 渐近展开与数值积分结果吻合良好，证明了解析方法的准确性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 所得结果适用于由局部力集合（如从平面突出的摆动纤毛）驱动的非定常Stokes流动，为相关物理现象提供了有效的理论分析工具。

Abstract: We derive the far-field solution for the Green's function of a point force
acting perpendicular to a no-slip wall in a Brinkman fluid, focusing on the
regime where the distance between the force and the wall is much smaller than
the screening length. The general solution is obtained in closed form up to a
single integral and can be systematically expanded in a Taylor series in both
the far-field and near-field limits. The flow can then be expressed as a series
of source-multipole singularities with an additional, analytically known,
correction in the proximity of the wall. Comparisons with numerical integration
demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of the asymptotic expansions. The
results are also applicable to the unsteady Stokes flow driven by a localized
assembly of forces, such as a beating cilium protruding from a flat surface.

Motivation: 传统神经算子使用标准L2损失训练时会导致精细尺度湍流结构过度平滑，无法准确捕捉湍流细节。

Method: 采用对抗训练的神经算子（adv-NO）结合生成式建模方法，在三个湍流应用场景中进行验证：时空超分辨率、预测和稀疏流场重建。

Result: 在Schlieren射流超分辨率中能量谱误差降低15倍；在3D各向同性湍流预测中仅用160个时间步就能准确预测5个涡旋翻转时间，推理速度比基线扩散方法快114倍；在圆柱尾流重建中能从稀疏PTV输入推断完整3D速度压力场。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了低计算成本下的准确重建和预测，为实验和计算流体力学中的近实时分析和控制提供了可能。

Abstract: Neural operators are promising surrogates for dynamical systems but when
trained with standard L2 losses they tend to oversmooth fine-scale turbulent
structures. Here, we show that combining operator learning with generative
modeling overcomes this limitation. We consider three practical turbulent-flow
challenges where conventional neural operators fail: spatio-temporal
super-resolution, forecasting, and sparse flow reconstruction. For Schlieren
jet super-resolution, an adversarially trained neural operator (adv-NO) reduces
the energy-spectrum error by 15x while preserving sharp gradients at neural
operator-like inference cost. For 3D homogeneous isotropic turbulence, adv-NO
trained on only 160 timesteps from a single trajectory forecasts accurately for
five eddy-turnover times and offers 114x wall-clock speed-up at inference than
the baseline diffusion-based forecasters, enabling near-real-time rollouts. For
reconstructing cylinder wake flows from highly sparse Particle Tracking
Velocimetry-like inputs, a conditional generative model infers full 3D velocity
and pressure fields with correct phase alignment and statistics. These advances
enable accurate reconstruction and forecasting at low compute cost, bringing
near-real-time analysis and control within reach in experimental and
computational fluid mechanics. See our project page:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了两种基于学习的动态目标指向方法（强化学习和模仿学习），用于改善地球观测卫星的数据采集效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球观测卫星存在轨道偏移困难、传感器视野有限、指向操作资源消耗大等限制，需要优化数据采集效率。动态目标指向技术可以利用卫星资源和预光仪器数据来智能地重新配置和指向主仪器。

Method: 提出两种学习方法：强化学习和模仿学习。这些方法基于动态规划解决方案来规划采样位置序列。与现有的含有经验法则的动态目标指向方法进行了对比评估。

Result: 模仿学习比最佳经验法划方法平均提高10.0%，强化学习平均提高13.7%。两种学习方法都可以在相对小量的数据下有效训练。

Conclusion: 学习方法在动态目标指向应用中显示出显著优势，能够提高地球观测卫星的科学信息收集效率。

Abstract: Earth observing satellites are powerful tools for collecting scientific
information about our planet, however they have limitations: they cannot easily
deviate from their orbital trajectories, their sensors have a limited field of
view, and pointing and operating these sensors can take a large amount of the
spacecraft's resources. It is important for these satellites to optimize the
data they collect and include only the most important or informative
measurements. Dynamic targeting is an emerging concept in which satellite
resources and data from a lookahead instrument are used to intelligently
reconfigure and point a primary instrument. Simulation studies have shown that
dynamic targeting increases the amount of scientific information gathered
versus conventional sampling strategies. In this work, we present two different
learning-based approaches to dynamic targeting, using reinforcement and
imitation learning, respectively. These learning methods build on a dynamic
programming solution to plan a sequence of sampling locations. We evaluate our
approaches against existing heuristic methods for dynamic targeting, showing
the benefits of using learning for this application. Imitation learning
performs on average 10.0\% better than the best heuristic method, while
reinforcement learning performs on average 13.7\% better. We also show that
both learning methods can be trained effectively with relatively small amounts
of data.

TL;DR: EnvX是一个利用Agentic AI将GitHub仓库转化为智能代理的框架，通过自然语言交互和代理间协作实现软件组件的自动化重用，在GitTaskBench基准测试中表现优于现有框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源软件组件重用目前需要手动操作、容易出错且缺乏连接性，开发者需要阅读文档、理解API并编写集成代码，存在显著的效率障碍。

Method: EnvX采用三阶段流程：1) TODO引导的环境初始化；2) 人类对齐的代理自动化；3) 代理间(A2A)协作协议，结合大语言模型能力和结构化工具集成。

Result: 在GitTaskBench基准测试的18个跨域仓库中，EnvX实现了74.07%的执行完成率和51.85%的任务通过率，优于现有框架，并能支持多仓库协作。

Conclusion: 这项工作标志着从将仓库视为被动代码资源到智能交互代理的转变，促进了开源生态系统中更大的可访问性和协作性。

Abstract: The widespread availability of open-source repositories has led to a vast
collection of reusable software components, yet their utilization remains
manual, error-prone, and disconnected. Developers must navigate documentation,
understand APIs, and write integration code, creating significant barriers to
efficient software reuse. To address this, we present EnvX, a framework that
leverages Agentic AI to agentize GitHub repositories, transforming them into
intelligent, autonomous agents capable of natural language interaction and
inter-agent collaboration. Unlike existing approaches that treat repositories
as static code resources, EnvX reimagines them as active agents through a
three-phase process: (1) TODO-guided environment initialization, which sets up
the necessary dependencies, data, and validation datasets; (2) human-aligned
agentic automation, allowing repository-specific agents to autonomously perform
real-world tasks; and (3) Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol, enabling multiple
agents to collaborate. By combining large language model capabilities with
structured tool integration, EnvX automates not just code generation, but the
entire process of understanding, initializing, and operationalizing repository
functionality. We evaluate EnvX on the GitTaskBench benchmark, using 18
repositories across domains such as image processing, speech recognition,
document analysis, and video manipulation. Our results show that EnvX achieves
a 74.07% execution completion rate and 51.85% task pass rate, outperforming
existing frameworks. Case studies further demonstrate EnvX's ability to enable
multi-repository collaboration via the A2A protocol. This work marks a shift
from treating repositories as passive code resources to intelligent,
interactive agents, fostering greater accessibility and collaboration within
the open-source ecosystem.

TL;DR: 基于大模型的任务特定信任语义精炼模型(2TSD)，通过教师-学生组织架构减少信任评估开销，提高协作选择准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决设备间信任评估过程中的频繁数据交换、复杂推理和动态环境带来的高开销问题

Method: 使用大模型驱动的教师-学生组织架构，教师终端负责多维信任数据收集和任务特定信任语义提取，然后向学生终端传输信任语义信息

Result: 实验结果显示模型能够减少协作者评估时间、降低设备资源消耗并提高协作选择的准确性

Conclusion: 2TSD模型通过大模型驱动的分布式信任评估方案，有效解决了协作设备选择中的效率和准确性挑战

Abstract: Accurate trustworthiness evaluation of potential collaborating devices is
essential for the effective execution of complex computing tasks. This
evaluation process involves collecting diverse trust-related data from
potential collaborators, including historical performance and available
resources, for collaborator selection. However, when each task owner
independently assesses all collaborators' trustworthiness, frequent data
exchange, complex reasoning, and dynamic situation changes can result in
significant overhead and deteriorated trust evaluation. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a task-specific trust semantics distillation (2TSD)
model based on a large AI model (LAM)-driven teacher-student agent
architecture. The teacher agent is deployed on a server with powerful
computational capabilities and an augmented memory module dedicated to
multidimensional trust-related data collection, task-specific trust semantics
extraction, and task-collaborator matching analysis. Upon receiving
task-specific requests from device-side student agents, the teacher agent
transfers the trust semantics of potential collaborators to the student agents,
enabling rapid and accurate collaborator selection. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed 2TSD model can reduce collaborator evaluation
time, decrease device resource consumption, and improve the accuracy of
collaborator selection.

Conclusion: ExRAP框架有效解决了动态环境中的持续指令跟随问题，通过环境探索和记忆管理实现了更好的任务性能和环境适应性。

Abstract: This study presents an Exploratory Retrieval-Augmented Planning (ExRAP)
framework, designed to tackle continual instruction following tasks of embodied
agents in dynamic, non-stationary environments. The framework enhances Large
Language Models' (LLMs) embodied reasoning capabilities by efficiently
exploring the physical environment and establishing the environmental context
memory, thereby effectively grounding the task planning process in time-varying
environment contexts. In ExRAP, given multiple continual instruction following
tasks, each instruction is decomposed into queries on the environmental context
memory and task executions conditioned on the query results. To efficiently
handle these multiple tasks that are performed continuously and simultaneously,
we implement an exploration-integrated task planning scheme by incorporating
the {information-based exploration} into the LLM-based planning process.
Combined with memory-augmented query evaluation, this integrated scheme not
only allows for a better balance between the validity of the environmental
context memory and the load of environment exploration, but also improves
overall task performance. Furthermore, we devise a {temporal consistency
refinement} scheme for query evaluation to address the inherent decay of
knowledge in the memory. Through experiments with VirtualHome, ALFRED, and
CARLA, our approach demonstrates robustness against a variety of embodied
instruction following scenarios involving different instruction scales and
types, and non-stationarity degrees, and it consistently outperforms other
state-of-the-art LLM-based task planning approaches in terms of both goal
success rate and execution efficiency.

Abstract: The evolution toward Level 4 (L4) Autonomous Networks (AN) represents a
strategic inflection point in telecommunications, where networks must transcend

transformative potential: demonstrating sub-10 ms real-time control in 5G NR
sub-6 GHz while achieving 6% higher downlink throughput than Outer Loop Link
Adaptation (OLLA) algorithms and 67% Block Error Rate (BLER) reduction for
ultra-reliable services through dynamic Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS)

overcoming traditional autonomy barriers and advancing critical L4-enabling

Abstract: Generating regulatorily compliant Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) remains a
high-cost, low-scalability bottleneck in Anti-Money Laundering (AML) workflows.
While large language models (LLMs) offer promising fluency, they suffer from
factual hallucination, limited crime typology alignment, and poor
explainability -- posing unacceptable risks in compliance-critical domains.
This paper introduces Co-Investigator AI, an agentic framework optimized to
produce Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) significantly faster and with
greater accuracy than traditional methods. Drawing inspiration from recent
advances in autonomous agent architectures, such as the AI Co-Scientist, our
approach integrates specialized agents for planning, crime type detection,
external intelligence gathering, and compliance validation. The system features
dynamic memory management, an AI-Privacy Guard layer for sensitive data
handling, and a real-time validation agent employing the Agent-as-a-Judge
paradigm to ensure continuous narrative quality assurance. Human investigators
remain firmly in the loop, empowered to review and refine drafts in a
collaborative workflow that blends AI efficiency with domain expertise. We
demonstrate the versatility of Co-Investigator AI across a range of complex
financial crime scenarios, highlighting its ability to streamline SAR drafting,
align narratives with regulatory expectations, and enable compliance teams to
focus on higher-order analytical work. This approach marks the beginning of a
new era in compliance reporting -- bringing the transformative benefits of AI
agents to the core of regulatory processes and paving the way for scalable,
reliable, and transparent SAR generation.

Conclusion: TCPO方法展示了将偏好学习技术与思维链过程结合，能够有效提升视觉语言模型在具身智能体中的决策能力。

Abstract: Using effective generalization capabilities of vision language models (VLMs)
in context-specific dynamic tasks for embodied artificial intelligence remains
a significant challenge. Although supervised fine-tuned models can better align
with the real physical world, they still exhibit sluggish responses and
hallucination issues in dynamically changing environments, necessitating
further alignment. Existing post-SFT methods, reliant on reinforcement learning
and chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, are constrained by sparse rewards and
action-only optimization, resulting in low sample efficiency, poor consistency,
and model degradation. To address these issues, this paper proposes
Thought-Centric Preference Optimization (TCPO) for effective embodied
decision-making. Specifically, TCPO introduces a stepwise preference-based
optimization approach, transforming sparse reward signals into richer step
sample pairs. It emphasizes the alignment of the model's intermediate reasoning
process, mitigating the problem of model degradation. Moreover, by
incorporating Action Policy Consistency Constraint (APC), it further imposes
consistency constraints on the model output. Experiments in the ALFWorld
environment demonstrate an average success rate of 26.67%, achieving a 6%
improvement over RL4VLM and validating the effectiveness of our approach in
mitigating model degradation after fine-tuning. These results highlight the
potential of integrating preference-based learning techniques with CoT
processes to enhance the decision-making capabilities of vision-language models
in embodied agents.

Method: 利用不同LLM评判者之间的不一致性，通过线性规划问题计算评价能力，开发无知识告警机制

Result: 开发出能够以零假阶正率检测至少一个评判者违反用户指定评分要求的告警系统

Conclusion: 逻辑一致性分析可以有效监控LLM评判者，无需无限监控链条，为LLM评价提供了可靠的质量控制方法

Abstract: If we use LLMs as judges to evaluate the complex decisions of other LLMs, who
or what monitors the judges? Infinite monitoring chains are inevitable whenever
we do not know the ground truth of the decisions by experts and we do not want
to trust them. One way to ameliorate our evaluation uncertainty is to exploit
the use of logical consistency between disagreeing experts. By observing how
LLM judges agree and disagree while grading other LLMs, we can compute the only
possible evaluations of their grading ability. For example, if two LLM judges
disagree on which tasks a third one completed correctly, they cannot both be
100\% correct in their judgments. This logic can be formalized as a Linear
Programming problem in the space of integer response counts for any finite
test. We use it here to develop no-knowledge alarms for misaligned LLM judges.
The alarms can detect, with no false positives, that at least one member or
more of an ensemble of judges are violating a user specified grading ability
requirement.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are critical for automating complex tasks, yet
their practical deployment is severely hampered by the challenge of failure
attribution. Current diagnostic tools, which rely on statistical correlations,
are fundamentally inadequate; on challenging benchmarks like Who\&When,
state-of-the-art methods achieve less than 15\% accuracy in locating the
root-cause step of a failure. To address this critical gap, we introduce the
first failure attribution framework for MAS grounded in multi-granularity
causal inference. Our approach makes two key technical contributions: (1) a
performance causal inversion principle, which correctly models performance
dependencies by reversing the data flow in execution logs, combined with
Shapley values to accurately assign agent-level blame; (2) a novel causal
discovery algorithm, CDC-MAS, that robustly identifies critical failure steps
by tackling the non-stationary nature of MAS interaction data. The framework's
attribution results directly fuel an automated optimization loop, generating
targeted suggestions whose efficacy is validated via counterfactual
simulations. Evaluations on the Who\&When and TRAIL benchmarks demonstrate a
significant leap in performance. Our method achieves up to 36.2\% step-level
accuracy. Crucially, the generated optimizations boost overall task success
rates by an average of 22.4\%. This work provides a principled and effective
solution for debugging complex agent interactions, paving the way for more
reliable and interpretable multi-agent systems.

Motivation: 任务动机是建立一种能够模仿人类双重过程推理机制的AI模型，以理解和复现人类认知偏差，促进AI系统具备精细化的社交认知能力。

Method: 方法包括使用图卷积网络（GCNs）实现快速习惯性推理系统（System 1），以及通过元学习技术驱动的慢速上下文敏感学习系统（System 2），并通过学习的上下文门机制动态平衡两者。

Result: 实验结果显示，该双系统方法能够精确模仿人类适应性行为，实现对未见上下文的健壮推广，并解释了推理偏差的认知机制。

Conclusion: 这项工作在人工智能与认知理论之间建立了桥梁，为具有精细化、类人社交认知和适应性决策能力的AI系统开启了新路径。

Abstract: We introduce a novel Theory of Mind (ToM) framework inspired by dual-process
theories from cognitive science, integrating a fast, habitual graph-based
reasoning system (System 1), implemented via graph convolutional networks
(GCNs), and a slower, context-sensitive meta-adaptive learning system (System
2), driven by meta-learning techniques. Our model dynamically balances
intuitive and deliberative reasoning through a learned context gate mechanism.
We validate our architecture on canonical false-belief tasks and systematically
explore its capacity to replicate hallmark cognitive biases associated with
dual-process theory, including anchoring, cognitive-load fatigue, framing
effects, and priming effects. Experimental results demonstrate that our
dual-process approach closely mirrors human adaptive behavior, achieves robust
generalization to unseen contexts, and elucidates cognitive mechanisms
underlying reasoning biases. This work bridges artificial intelligence and
cognitive theory, paving the way for AI systems exhibiting nuanced, human-like
social cognition and adaptive decision-making capabilities.

Abstract: AI scientist systems, capable of autonomously executing the full research
workflow from hypothesis generation and experimentation to paper writing, hold
significant potential for accelerating scientific discovery. However, the
internal workflow of these systems have not been closely examined. This lack of
scrutiny poses a risk of introducing flaws that could undermine the integrity,
reliability, and trustworthiness of their research outputs. In this paper, we
identify four potential failure modes in contemporary AI scientist systems:
inappropriate benchmark selection, data leakage, metric misuse, and post-hoc
selection bias. To examine these risks, we design controlled experiments that
isolate each failure mode while addressing challenges unique to evaluating AI
scientist systems. Our assessment of two prominent open-source AI scientist
systems reveals the presence of several failures, across a spectrum of
severity, which can be easily overlooked in practice. Finally, we demonstrate
that access to trace logs and code from the full automated workflow enables far
more effective detection of such failures than examining the final paper alone.
We thus recommend journals and conferences evaluating AI-generated research to
mandate submission of these artifacts alongside the paper to ensure
transparency, accountability, and reproducibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI系统现在既能做决策又能进行故事推理，但这两种能力主要是分开研究的，需要架设平台来探索故事框架如何影响奖励基于学习

Method: 采用双系统架构：一个强化学习策略根据历史经验建议行动，另一个语言模型通过不同故事框架处理这些建议来指导决策，在可配置的gridworld环境中实现

Result: 实现了一个模块化设计的实验平台，能够控制测试环境复杂性、故事参数以及强化学习与故事基于决策的交互作用，日志系统记录了从RL策略价值到语言模型推理的基本决策指标

Conclusion: 虽然是预初步骤，但这个实现为研究不同故事框架如何影响奖励基于决策提供了基础，并为探索AI系统中优化基于学习与符号推理之间的潜在交互作用创建了条件

Abstract: We present a preliminary experimental platform that explores how narrative
elements might shape AI decision-making by combining reinforcement learning
(RL) with language model reasoning. While AI systems can now both make
decisions and engage in narrative reasoning, these capabilities have mostly
been studied separately. Our platform attempts to bridge this gap using a
dual-system architecture to examine how narrative frameworks could influence
reward-based learning. The system comprises a reinforcement learning policy
that suggests actions based on past experience, and a language model that
processes these suggestions through different narrative frameworks to guide
decisions. This setup enables initial experimentation with narrative elements
while maintaining consistent environment and reward structures. We implement
this architecture in a configurable gridworld environment, where agents receive
both policy suggestions and information about their surroundings. The
platform's modular design facilitates controlled testing of environmental
complexity, narrative parameters, and the interaction between reinforcement
learning and narrative-based decisions. Our logging system captures basic
decision metrics, from RL policy values to language model reasoning to action
selection patterns. While preliminary, this implementation provides a
foundation for studying how different narrative frameworks might affect
reward-based decisions and exploring potential interactions between
optimization-based learning and symbolic reasoning in AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造生成技术快速发展，传统检测方法需要频繁昂贵的重新训练，需要一种能够持续适应新兴技术的检测框架

Method: 提出持续学习框架，模拟7年间深度伪造技术的真实时间演变，基于轻量级视觉骨干网络实现实时检测性能，引入两个新评估指标

Result: 实现了高效适应（比完全重新训练快155倍）和稳健的历史知识保留，但对未来生成器的泛化能力接近随机（FWT-AUC≈0.5）

Conclusion: 提出了非通用深度伪造分布假设，指出每个生成器都有独特特征，当前方法在没有额外训练的情况下对未来技术的泛化能力有限

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deepfake generation technologies poses critical
challenges for detection systems, as non-continual learning methods demand
frequent and expensive retraining. We reframe deepfake detection (DFD) as a
Continual Learning (CL) problem, proposing an efficient framework that
incrementally adapts to emerging visual manipulation techniques while retaining
knowledge of past generators. Our framework, unlike prior approaches that rely
on unreal simulation sequences, simulates the real-world chronological
evolution of deepfake technologies in extended periods across 7 years.
Simultaneously, our framework builds upon lightweight visual backbones to allow
for the real-time performance of DFD systems. Additionally, we contribute two
novel metrics: Continual AUC (C-AUC) for historical performance and Forward
Transfer AUC (FWT-AUC) for future generalization. Through extensive
experimentation (over 600 simulations), we empirically demonstrate that while
efficient adaptation (+155 times faster than full retraining) and robust
retention of historical knowledge is possible, the generalization of current
approaches to future generators without additional training remains near-random
(FWT-AUC $\approx$ 0.5) due to the unique imprint characterizing each existing
generator. Such observations are the foundation of our newly proposed
Non-Universal Deepfake Distribution Hypothesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已有不可学习方法能够生成不可学习示例，但在多任务数据集Taskonomy上，这些示例仍然在语义分割等任务中表现良好，失败于跨任务的不可学习性。这一现象引发了对真正不可学习示例达成距离的探索。

Method: 从模型优化角度出发，观察清洁模型和毒化模型的收敛过程差异。通过损失地形分析，发现只有部分关键参数优化路径显示显著差异，从而使用损失地形来解释不可学习示例的基础原因。提出了基于分析的Sharpness-Aware Learnability (SAL)来量化参数的不可学习性，并基于SAL分布提出了Unlearnable Distance (UD)来量度数据的不可学习性。

Result: 在多任务数据集Taskonomy上，现有的不可学习方法在语义分割等任务中失效，无法实现跨任务的不可学习性。损失地形分析显示了清洁模型和毒化模型在参数优化路径上的差异。提出的SAL和UD方法能够有效量化参数和数据的不可学习性。

Conclusion: 现有的不可学习方法在多任务场景下存在限制，无法实现真正的跨任务不可学习性。损失地形与不可学习性存在密切关联，提出的SAL和UD方法为评估和提升不可学习方法的能力提供了新的视角和工具。该研究促进了社区对现有方法能力边界的认识，为开发更有效的不可学习技术奠定了基础。

Abstract: High-quality data plays an indispensable role in the era of large models, but
the use of unauthorized data for model training greatly damages the interests
of data owners. To overcome this threat, several unlearnable methods have been
proposed, which generate unlearnable examples (UEs) by compromising the
training availability of data. Clearly, due to unknown training purposes and
the powerful representation learning capabilities of existing models, these
data are expected to be unlearnable for models across multiple tasks, i.e.,
they will not help improve the model's performance. However, unexpectedly, we
find that on the multi-task dataset Taskonomy, UEs still perform well in tasks
such as semantic segmentation, failing to exhibit cross-task unlearnability.
This phenomenon leads us to question: How far are we from attaining truly
unlearnable examples? We attempt to answer this question from the perspective
of model optimization. To this end, we observe the difference in the
convergence process between clean and poisoned models using a simple model
architecture. Subsequently, from the loss landscape we find that only a part of
the critical parameter optimization paths show significant differences,
implying a close relationship between the loss landscape and unlearnability.
Consequently, we employ the loss landscape to explain the underlying reasons
for UEs and propose Sharpness-Aware Learnability (SAL) to quantify the
unlearnability of parameters based on this explanation. Furthermore, we propose
an Unlearnable Distance (UD) to measure the unlearnability of data based on the
SAL distribution of parameters in clean and poisoned models. Finally, we
conduct benchmark tests on mainstream unlearnable methods using the proposed
UD, aiming to promote community awareness of the capability boundaries of
existing unlearnable methods.

Abstract: We present JEL, a novel computationally efficient end-to-end multi-neural
network based entity linking model, which beats current state-of-art model.
Knowledge Graphs have emerged as a compelling abstraction for capturing
critical relationships among the entities of interest and integrating data from
multiple heterogeneous sources. A core problem in leveraging a knowledge graph
is linking its entities to the mentions (e.g., people, company names) that are
encountered in textual sources (e.g., news, blogs., etc) correctly, since there
are thousands of entities to consider for each mention. This task of linking
mentions and entities is referred as Entity Linking (EL). It is a fundamental
task in natural language processing and is beneficial in various uses cases,
such as building a New Analytics platform. News Analytics, in JPMorgan, is an
essential task that benefits multiple groups across the firm. According to a
survey conducted by the Innovation Digital team 1 , around 25 teams across the
firm are actively looking for news analytics solutions, and more than \$2
million is being spent annually on external vendor costs. Entity linking is
critical for bridging unstructured news text with knowledge graphs, enabling
users access to vast amounts of curated data in a knowledge graph and
dramatically facilitating their daily work.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) represent an emerging paradigm
within artificial intelligence, with applications throughout the medical
enterprise. Assessing GenAI applications necessitates a comprehensive
understanding of the clinical task and awareness of the variability in
performance when implemented in actual clinical environments. Presently, a
prevalent method for evaluating the performance of generative models relies on
quantitative benchmarks. Such benchmarks have limitations and may suffer from
train-to-the-test overfitting, optimizing performance for a specified test set
at the cost of generalizability across other task and data distributions.
Evaluation strategies leveraging human expertise and utilizing cost-effective
computational models as evaluators are gaining interest. We discuss current
state-of-the-art methodologies for assessing the performance of GenAI
applications in healthcare and medical devices.

Motivation: 联邦学习分布式特性使其容易受到恶意客户端的后门攻击，现有防御在面对自适应攻击者时表现不佳，需要更强大的防御机制。

Method: 首先设计了一种新的自适应攻击者，然后提出了Hammer and Anvil防御框架，结合两种正交防御原理，通过参数优化产生有效防御组合。

Result: 新型攻击只需20个客户端中的1-2个恶意客户端就能攻破现有先进防御；提出的Krum+防御能成功对抗新型自适应攻击和现有先进攻击。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了自适应攻击者的强大威胁，同时提供了有效的防御解决方案，强调了结合不同防御原理的重要性。

Abstract: Federated Learning is a distributed learning technique in which multiple
clients cooperate to train a machine learning model. Distributed settings
facilitate backdoor attacks by malicious clients, who can embed malicious
behaviors into the model during their participation in the training process.
These malicious behaviors are activated during inference by a specific trigger.
No defense against backdoor attacks has stood the test of time, especially
against adaptive attackers, a powerful but not fully explored category of
attackers. In this work, we first devise a new adaptive adversary that
surpasses existing adversaries in capabilities, yielding attacks that only
require one or two malicious clients out of 20 to break existing
state-of-the-art defenses. Then, we present Hammer and Anvil, a principled
defense approach that combines two defenses orthogonal in their underlying
principle to produce a combined defense that, given the right set of
parameters, must succeed against any attack. We show that our best combined
defense, Krum+, is successful against our new adaptive adversary and
state-of-the-art attacks.

Abstract: Objective: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) play a crucial role in diagnosing heart
conditions; however, the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI)-based
ECG analysis is often hindered by the limited availability of labeled data.
Self-supervised learning (SSL) can address this by leveraging large-scale
unlabeled data. We introduce PhysioCLR (Physiology-aware Contrastive Learning
Representation for ECG), a physiology-aware contrastive learning framework that
incorporates domain-specific priors to enhance the generalizability and
clinical relevance of ECG-based arrhythmia classification. Methods: During
pretraining, PhysioCLR learns to bring together embeddings of samples that
share similar clinically relevant features while pushing apart those that are
dissimilar. Unlike existing methods, our method integrates ECG physiological
similarity cues into contrastive learning, promoting the learning of clinically
meaningful representations. Additionally, we introduce ECG- specific
augmentations that preserve the ECG category post augmentation and propose a
hybrid loss function to further refine the quality of learned representations.
Results: We evaluate PhysioCLR on two public ECG datasets, Chapman and Georgia,
for multilabel ECG diagnoses, as well as a private ICU dataset labeled for
binary classification. Across the Chapman, Georgia, and private cohorts,
PhysioCLR boosts the mean AUROC by 12% relative to the strongest baseline,
underscoring its robust cross-dataset generalization. Conclusion: By embedding
physiological knowledge into contrastive learning, PhysioCLR enables the model
to learn clinically meaningful and transferable ECG eatures. Significance:
PhysioCLR demonstrates the potential of physiology-informed SSL to offer a
promising path toward more effective and label-efficient ECG diagnostics.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a novel, multidisciplinary Machine Learning
paradigm where multiple clients, such as mobile devices, collaborate to solve
machine learning problems. Initially introduced in Kone{\v{c}}n{\'y} et al.
(2016a,b); McMahan et al. (2017), FL has gained further attention through its
inclusion in the National AI Research and Development Strategic Plan (2023
Update) of the United States (Science and on Artificial Intelligence, 2023).
The FL training process is inherently decentralized and often takes place in
less controlled settings compared to data centers, posing unique challenges
distinct from those in fully controlled environments. In this thesis, we
identify five key challenges in Federated Learning and propose novel approaches
to address them. These challenges arise from the heterogeneity of data and
devices, communication issues, and privacy concerns for clients in FL training.
Moreover, even well-established theoretical advances in FL require diverse
forms of practical implementation to enhance their real-world applicability.
Our contributions advance FL algorithms and systems, bridging theoretical
advancements and practical implementations. More broadly, our work serves as a
guide for researchers navigating the complexities of translating theoretical
methods into efficient real-world implementations and software. Additionally,
it offers insights into the reverse process of adapting practical
implementation aspects back into theoretical algorithm design. This reverse
process is particularly intriguing, as the practical perspective compels us to
examine the underlying mechanics and flexibilities of algorithms more deeply,
often uncovering new dimensions of the algorithms under study.

Motivation: 扩展传统Transformer架构，通过可信度机制和上下文学习来提升模型的学习能力和预测性能，特别是处理训练数据中未出现过的新类别特征。

Method: 在Credibility Transformer基础上增加上下文学习机制，使用包含相似实例的上下文批次来增强CLS令牌表示，通过额外的上下文信息和微调来改善模型性能。

Conclusion: 提出的上下文学习机制有效增强了Credibility Transformer的性能，使其能够处理新出现的类别特征，具有很好的泛化能力。

Abstract: The starting point of our network architecture is the Credibility Transformer
which extends the classical Transformer architecture by a credibility mechanism
to improve model learning and predictive performance. This Credibility
Transformer learns credibilitized CLS tokens that serve as learned
representations of the original input features. In this paper we present a new
paradigm that augments this architecture by an in-context learning mechanism,
i.e., we increase the information set by a context batch consisting of similar
instances. This allows the model to enhance the CLS token representations of
the instances by additional in-context information and fine-tuning. We
empirically verify that this in-context learning enhances predictive accuracy
by adapting to similar risk patterns. Moreover, this in-context learning also
allows the model to generalize to new instances which, e.g., have feature
levels in the categorical covariates that have not been present when the model
was trained -- for a relevant example, think of a new vehicle model which has
just been developed by a car manufacturer.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for predicting rare, high-impact outcomes by
integrating large language models (LLMs) with a multi-model machine learning
(ML) architecture. The approach combines the predictive strength of black-box
models with the interpretability required for reliable decision-making. We use
LLM-powered feature engineering to extract and synthesize complex signals from
unstructured data, which are then processed within a layered ensemble of models
including XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression. The ensemble first
produces a continuous estimate of success likelihood, which is then thresholded
to produce a binary rare-event prediction. We apply this framework to the
domain of Venture Capital (VC), where investors must evaluate startups with
limited and noisy early-stage data. The empirical results show strong
performance: the model achieves precision between 9.8X and 11.1X the random
classifier baseline in three independent test subsets. Feature sensitivity
analysis further reveals interpretable success drivers: the startup's category
list accounts for 15.6% of predictive influence, followed by the number of
founders, while education level and domain expertise contribute smaller yet
consistent effects.

Abstract: Fairness-aware classification requires balancing performance and fairness,
often intensified by intersectional biases. Conflicting fairness definitions
further complicate the task, making it difficult to identify universally fair
solutions. Despite growing regulatory and societal demands for equitable AI,
popular toolkits offer limited support for exploring multi-dimensional fairness
and related trade-offs. To address this, we present mmm-fair, an open-source
toolkit leveraging boosting-based ensemble approaches that dynamically
optimizes model weights to jointly minimize classification errors and diverse
fairness violations, enabling flexible multi-objective optimization. The system
empowers users to deploy models that align with their context-specific needs
while reliably uncovering intersectional biases often missed by
state-of-the-art methods. In a nutshell, mmm-fair uniquely combines in-depth
multi-attribute fairness, multi-objective optimization, a no-code, chat-based
interface, LLM-powered explanations, interactive Pareto exploration for model
selection, custom fairness constraint definition, and deployment-ready models
in a single open-source toolkit, a combination rarely found in existing
fairness tools. Demo walkthrough available at: https://youtu.be/_rcpjlXFqkw.

Result: 应用于COMPAS再犯数据集和大型机动车保险索赔数据集，展示了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效处理回归和分类任务中的多属性公平性问题，特别是解决了连续属性和交叉子群体的公平性划分挑战。

Abstract: Ensuring equitable treatment (fairness) across protected attributes (such as
gender or ethnicity) is a critical issue in machine learning. Most existing
literature focuses on binary classification, but achieving fairness in
regression tasks-such as insurance pricing or hiring score assessments-is
equally important. Moreover, anti-discrimination laws also apply to continuous
attributes, such as age, for which many existing methods are not applicable. In
practice, multiple protected attributes can exist simultaneously; however,
methods targeting fairness across several attributes often overlook so-called
"fairness gerrymandering", thereby ignoring disparities among intersectional
subgroups (e.g., African-American women or Hispanic men). In this paper, we
propose a distance covariance regularisation framework that mitigates the
association between model predictions and protected attributes, in line with
the fairness definition of demographic parity, and that captures both linear
and nonlinear dependencies. To enhance applicability in the presence of
multiple protected attributes, we extend our framework by incorporating two
multivariate dependence measures based on distance covariance: the previously
proposed joint distance covariance (JdCov) and our novel concatenated distance
covariance (CCdCov), which effectively address fairness gerrymandering in both
regression and classification tasks involving protected attributes of various
types. We discuss and illustrate how to calibrate regularisation strength,
including a method based on Jensen-Shannon divergence, which quantifies
dissimilarities in prediction distributions across groups. We apply our
framework to the COMPAS recidivism dataset and a large motor insurance claims
dataset.

Conclusion: MARLINE能够有效处理非平稳环境中的概念漂移问题，即使源概念与目标概念不匹配也能成功利用多源知识，显著提高了预测准确性

Abstract: Concept drift is a major problem in online learning due to its impact on the
predictive performance of data stream mining systems. Recent studies have
started exploring data streams from different sources as a strategy to tackle
concept drift in a given target domain. These approaches make the assumption
that at least one of the source models represents a concept similar to the
target concept, which may not hold in many real-world scenarios. In this paper,
we propose a novel approach called Multi-source mApping with tRansfer LearnIng
for Non-stationary Environments (MARLINE). MARLINE can benefit from knowledge
from multiple data sources in non-stationary environments even when source and
target concepts do not match. This is achieved by projecting the target concept
to the space of each source concept, enabling multiple source sub-classifiers
to contribute towards the prediction of the target concept as part of an
ensemble. Experiments on several synthetic and real-world datasets show that
MARLINE was more accurate than several state-of-the-art data stream learning
approaches.

Result: 综合实验表明，两种方法在非平稳环境中都优于最先进的多标签流处理方法，证明了标签间知识转移对提升预测性能的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的两种迁移学习方法通过在不同标签间转移知识，有效提升了多标签数据流在非平稳环境中的分类性能，特别是显式建模标签依赖关系的BRPW-MARLENE方法表现更优。

Abstract: Label concepts in multi-label data streams often experience drift in
non-stationary environments, either independently or in relation to other
labels. Transferring knowledge between related labels can accelerate
adaptation, yet research on multi-label transfer learning for data streams
remains limited. To address this, we propose two novel transfer learning
methods: BR-MARLENE leverages knowledge from different labels in both source
and target streams for multi-label classification; BRPW-MARLENE builds on this
by explicitly modelling and transferring pairwise label dependencies to enhance
learning performance. Comprehensive experiments show that both methods
outperform state-of-the-art multi-label stream approaches in non-stationary
environments, demonstrating the effectiveness of inter-label knowledge transfer
for improved predictive performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个新颖框架，展示Transformer动态处理因果结构的能力，通过交错不同滞后的马尔可夫链来形成选择性归纳头，使模型能够根据上下文选择正确的因果结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究依赖固定因果结构的马尔可夫链来研究归纳头，但无法捕捉自然语言中动态变化的token关系。需要探索Transformer如何动态处理变化的因果结构。

Method: 使用具有不同滞后的交错马尔可夫链，保持转移概率固定但变化因果结构。构建3层Transformer实现选择性归纳头，并进行理论分析。

Result: Transformer学会了选择性归纳机制，能够通过识别正确滞后并从过去复制相应token来预测下一个token。该机制渐近收敛于最大似然解。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Transformer选择因果结构的能力，为理解其功能和可解释性提供了新见解，推进了对induction heads形成机制的认识。

Abstract: Transformers have exhibited exceptional capabilities in sequence modeling
tasks, leveraging self-attention and in-context learning. Critical to this
success are induction heads, attention circuits that enable copying tokens
based on their previous occurrences. In this work, we introduce a novel
framework that showcases transformers' ability to dynamically handle causal
structures. Existing works rely on Markov Chains to study the formation of
induction heads, revealing how transformers capture causal dependencies and
learn transition probabilities in-context. However, they rely on a fixed causal
structure that fails to capture the complexity of natural languages, where the
relationship between tokens dynamically changes with context. To this end, our
framework varies the causal structure through interleaved Markov chains with
different lags while keeping the transition probabilities fixed. This setting
unveils the formation of Selective Induction Heads, a new circuit that endows
transformers with the ability to select the correct causal structure
in-context. We empirically demonstrate that transformers learn this mechanism
to predict the next token by identifying the correct lag and copying the
corresponding token from the past. We provide a detailed construction of a
3-layer transformer to implement the selective induction head, and a
theoretical analysis proving that this mechanism asymptotically converges to
the maximum likelihood solution. Our findings advance the understanding of how
transformers select causal structures, providing new insights into their
functioning and interpretability.

Method: 基于Kovachki和Stuart(2021)的工作，在指数吸引不变流形上分析算法，推导修改损失函数的近似表达式，进行组合数学的精细分析，建立任意阶近似精度的连续修正方程。

Result: 证明了HB算法等价于带修改损失函数的梯度下降，获得了O(h^R)的全局近似边界，发现了包含Eulerian和Narayana多项式的丰富多项式族，推导了任意阶近似精度的主流动方程。

Conclusion: 研究为理解重球动量提供了新的理论视角，揭示了其数学结构中的丰富组合性质，为分析其他优化算法提供了路线图和方法框架。

Abstract: We analyze gradient descent with Polyak heavy-ball momentum (HB) whose fixed
momentum parameter $\beta \in (0, 1)$ provides exponential decay of memory.
Building on Kovachki and Stuart (2021), we prove that on an exponentially
attractive invariant manifold the algorithm is exactly plain gradient descent
with a modified loss, provided that the step size $h$ is small enough. Although
the modified loss does not admit a closed-form expression, we describe it with
arbitrary precision and prove global (finite "time" horizon) approximation
bounds $O(h^{R})$ for any finite order $R \geq 2$. We then conduct a
fine-grained analysis of the combinatorics underlying the memoryless
approximations of HB, in particular, finding a rich family of polynomials in
$\beta$ hidden inside which contains Eulerian and Narayana polynomials. We
derive continuous modified equations of arbitrary approximation order (with
rigorous bounds) and the principal flow that approximates the HB dynamics,
generalizing Rosca et al. (2023). Approximation theorems cover both full-batch
and mini-batch HB. Our theoretical results shed new light on the main features
of gradient descent with heavy-ball momentum, and outline a road-map for
similar analysis of other optimization algorithms.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究使用生成对抗网络(WGAN-GP)和去噪液散模型来生成实际的EEG人工器官伪影数据，以解决EEG数据中伪影标注成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG数据中的伪影(肌肉、眼球运动、电极、咬喉、发抖等)干扰自动分析，但大规模标注成本较高。研究者想通过生成实际的标签化伪影数据来进行数据增帆和压力测试。

Method: 使用TUH EEG Artifact数据集，精心处理数据分割和前处理(分别适配于对抗训练和液散模型)。比较条件WGAN-GP模型和1D去噪液散模型的性能。评估三个方面：保真度(频谱、相关性、分布指标)、特异性(类别恢复)和实用性(数据增帆效果)。

Result: WGAN-GP模型在频谱对齐和分布相似性方面表现更好，但两种模型在类别条件恢复方面都较弱，限制了立即的数据增帆效果。

Conclusion: 研究为EEG伪影生成设置了基准线，揭示了条件控制和覆盖率方面的改进机会。释放了可复现的流水线和评估脚本以便未来研究。

Abstract: Artifacts in electroencephalography (EEG) -- muscle, eye movement, electrode,
chewing, and shiver -- confound automated analysis yet are costly to label at
scale. We study whether modern generative models can synthesize realistic,
label-aware artifact segments suitable for augmentation and stress-testing.
Using the TUH EEG Artifact (TUAR) corpus, we curate subject-wise splits and
fixed-length multi-channel windows (e.g., 250 samples) with preprocessing
tailored to each model (per-window min-max for adversarial training;
per-recording/channel $z$-score for diffusion). We compare a conditional
WGAN-GP with a projection discriminator to a 1D denoising diffusion model with
classifier-free guidance, and evaluate along three axes: (i) fidelity via Welch
band-power deltas ($\Delta\delta,\ \Delta\theta,\ \Delta\alpha,\ \Delta\beta$),
channel-covariance Frobenius distance, autocorrelation $L_2$, and
distributional metrics (MMD/PRD); (ii) specificity via class-conditional
recovery with lightweight $k$NN/classifiers; and (iii) utility via augmentation
effects on artifact recognition. In our setting, WGAN-GP achieves closer
spectral alignment and lower MMD to real data, while both models exhibit weak
class-conditional recovery, limiting immediate augmentation gains and revealing
opportunities for stronger conditioning and coverage. We release a reproducible
pipeline -- data manifests, training configurations, and evaluation scripts --
to establish a baseline for EEG artifact synthesis and to surface actionable
failure modes for future work.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效提升降维模型在长时间范围内的预测性能，为复杂PDE问题提供了更加高效的数值求解方案

Abstract: Solving complex partial differential equations is vital in the physical
sciences, but often requires computationally expensive numerical methods.
Reduced-order models (ROMs) address this by exploiting dimensionality reduction
to create fast approximations. While modern ROMs can solve parameterized
families of PDEs, their predictive power degrades over long time horizons. We
address this by (1) introducing a flexible, high-order, yet inexpensive
finite-difference scheme and (2) proposing a Rollout loss that trains ROMs to
make accurate predictions over arbitrary time horizons. We demonstrate our
approach on the 2D Burgers equation.

Conclusion: PS框架为上下文随机优化提供了有效的策略选择解决方案，能够自适应地选择最优策略，具有良好的泛化性能

Abstract: We address the problem of policy selection in contextual stochastic
optimization (CSO), where covariates are available as contextual information
and decisions must satisfy hard feasibility constraints. In many CSO settings,
multiple candidate policies--arising from different modeling paradigms--exhibit
heterogeneous performance across the covariate space, with no single policy
uniformly dominating. We propose Prescribe-then-Select (PS), a modular
framework that first constructs a library of feasible candidate policies and
then learns a meta-policy to select the best policy for the observed
covariates. We implement the meta-policy using ensembles of Optimal Policy
Trees trained via cross-validation on the training set, making policy choice
entirely data-driven. Across two benchmark CSO problems--single-stage
newsvendor and two-stage shipment planning--PS consistently outperforms the
best single policy in heterogeneous regimes of the covariate space and
converges to the dominant policy when such heterogeneity is absent. All the

Motivation: 联邦学习中通信成本和隐私保护是两个关键问题，现有研究对梯度压缩和差分隐私机制的分析是孤立的，需要一种联合分析方法来获得更灵活和精确的隐私保证。

Method: 提出SGM机制，直接结合梯度压缩（sketching）和高斯机制（Gaussian mechanism），使用Rényi-DP工具进行联合隐私分析，证明隐私级别与压缩维度b的平方根成反比。

Result: 理论证明SGM在相同噪声预算下能提供比原始高斯机制更强的隐私保护，实验表明在相同隐私级别下，基于SGM的联邦学习性能至少与非压缩的私有FL变体相当，在某些设置下更优。

Conclusion: SGM机制通过联合分析梯度压缩和差分隐私，实现了通信效率和隐私保护的平衡，服务器端使用自适应优化器能进一步提升性能同时保持隐私保证。

Abstract: Communication cost and privacy are two major considerations in federated
learning (FL). For communication cost, gradient compression by sketching the
clients' transmitted model updates is often used for reducing per-round
communication. For privacy, the Gaussian mechanism (GM), which consists of
clipping updates and adding Gaussian noise, is commonly used to guarantee
client-level differential privacy. Existing literature on private FL analyzes
privacy of sketching and GM in an isolated manner, illustrating that sketching
provides privacy determined by the sketching dimension and that GM has to
supply any additional desired privacy.
  In this paper, we introduce the Sketched Gaussian Mechanism (SGM), which
directly combines sketching and the Gaussian mechanism for privacy. Using
R\'enyi-DP tools, we present a joint analysis of SGM's overall privacy
guarantee, which is significantly more flexible and sharper compared to
isolated analysis of sketching and GM privacy. In particular, we prove that the
privacy level of SGM for a fixed noise magnitude is proportional to
$1/\sqrt{b}$, where $b$ is the sketching dimension, indicating that (for
moderate $b$) SGM can provide much stronger privacy guarantees than the
original GM under the same noise budget. We demonstrate the application of SGM
to FL with either gradient descent or adaptive server optimizers, and establish
theoretical results on optimization convergence, which exhibits only a
logarithmic dependence on the number of parameters $d$. Experimental results
confirm that at the same privacy level, SGM based FL is at least competitive
with non-sketching private FL variants and outperforms them in some settings.
Moreover, using adaptive optimization at the server improves empirical
performance while maintaining the privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has seen significant advancements with the
adoption of deep learning techniques, yet challenges remain in terms of data
requirements, reliability and robustness. This paper explores a novel
application of Ensemble Distribution Distillation (EDD) within a
self-supervised learning framework for HAR aimed at overcoming these
challenges. By leveraging unlabeled data and a partially supervised training
strategy, our approach yields an increase in predictive accuracy, robust
estimates of uncertainty, and substantial increases in robustness against
adversarial perturbation; thereby significantly improving reliability in
real-world scenarios without increasing computational complexity at inference.
We demonstrate this with an evaluation on several publicly available datasets.
The contributions of this work include the development of a self-supervised EDD
framework, an innovative data augmentation technique designed for HAR, and
empirical validation of the proposed method's effectiveness in increasing
robustness and reliability.

Abstract: Distributed and federated learning are essential paradigms for training
models across decentralized data sources while preserving privacy, yet
communication overhead remains a major bottleneck. This dissertation explores
strategies to improve communication efficiency, focusing on model compression,
local training, and personalization. We establish a unified framework for
biased and unbiased compression operators with convergence guarantees, then
propose adaptive local training strategies that incorporate personalization to
accelerate convergence and mitigate client drift. In particular, Scafflix
balances global and personalized objectives, achieving superior performance
under both IID and non-IID settings. We further introduce privacy-preserving
pruning frameworks that optimize sparsity while minimizing communication costs,
with Cohort-Squeeze leveraging hierarchical aggregation to reduce cross-device
overhead. Finally, SymWanda, a symmetric post-training pruning method, enhances
robustness under high sparsity and maintains accuracy without retraining.
Extensive experiments on benchmarks and large-scale language models demonstrate
favorable trade-offs among accuracy, convergence, and communication, offering
theoretical and practical insights for scalable, efficient distributed
learning.

Conclusion: CRISP使研究人员能够专注于临床AI研究， democratizes大规模多机构重症监护数据的访问

Abstract: While existing critical care EHR datasets such as MIMIC and eICU have enabled
significant advances in clinical AI research, the CRITICAL dataset opens new
frontiers by providing extensive scale and diversity -- containing 1.95 billion
records from 371,365 patients across four geographically diverse CTSA
institutions. CRITICAL's unique strength lies in capturing full-spectrum
patient journeys, including pre-ICU, ICU, and post-ICU encounters across both
inpatient and outpatient settings. This multi-institutional, longitudinal
perspective creates transformative opportunities for developing generalizable
predictive models and advancing health equity research. However, the richness
of this multi-site resource introduces substantial complexity in data
harmonization, with heterogeneous collection practices and diverse vocabulary
usage patterns requiring sophisticated preprocessing approaches.
  We present CRISP to unlock the full potential of this valuable resource.
CRISP systematically transforms raw Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership
Common Data Model data into ML-ready datasets through: (1) transparent data
quality management with comprehensive audit trails, (2) cross-vocabulary
mapping of heterogeneous medical terminologies to unified SNOMED-CT standards,
with deduplication and unit standardization, (3) modular architecture with
parallel optimization enabling complete dataset processing in $<$1 day even on
standard computing hardware, and (4) comprehensive baseline model benchmarks
spanning multiple clinical prediction tasks to establish reproducible
performance standards. By providing processing pipeline, baseline
implementations, and detailed transformation documentation, CRISP saves
researchers months of preprocessing effort and democratizes access to
large-scale multi-institutional critical care data, enabling them to focus on
advancing clinical AI.

capabilities in various downstream tasks but typically face Catastrophic
Forgetting (CF) during fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose the
Forgetting-Aware Pruning Metric (FAPM), a novel pruning-based approach to
balance CF and downstream task performance. Our investigation reveals that the
degree to which task vectors (i.e., the subtraction of pre-trained weights from
the weights fine-tuned on downstream tasks) overlap with pre-trained model
parameters is a critical factor for CF. Based on this finding, FAPM employs the
ratio of the task vector to pre-trained model parameters as a metric to
quantify CF, integrating this measure into the pruning criteria. Importantly,
FAPM does not necessitate modifications to the training process or model
architecture, nor does it require any auxiliary data. We conducted extensive
experiments across eight datasets, covering natural language inference, General
Q&A, Medical Q&A, Math Q&A, reading comprehension, and cloze tests. The results
demonstrate that FAPM limits CF to just 0.25\% while maintaining 99.67\%
accuracy on downstream tasks. We provide the code to reproduce our results.

Conclusion: 该框架有助于普及对VLMs科学推理能力的研究，为深入了解模型的能力和限制提供了视角。

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) grow in sophistication, their ability to
perform reasoning is coming under increasing supervision. While they excel at
many tasks, their grasp of fundamental scientific principles, such as physics,
remains an underexplored frontier. To reflect the advancements in these
capabilities, we introduce a novel and accessible framework designed to
rigorously evaluate VLMs on their understanding of 2D physics. Our framework
features a pragmatic scenario generator that creates a diverse testbed of over
400 problems across four core domains: Projectile Motion, Collision Dynamics,
Mechanics, and Fluid Dynamics. Through comprehensive evaluation of four
state-of-the-art VLMs, we demonstrate a strong correlation between model scale
and reasoning ability, with our top-performing model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, achieving
an overall score of 0.815. We find that while models excel at formulaic
problems, they struggle significantly with domains requiring abstract spatial
reasoning. By designing this framework, we aim to democratize the study of
scientific reasoning in VLMs and foster deeper insights into their capabilities
and limitations.

Abstract: Rainfall forecasting in Vietnam is highly challenging due to its diverse
climatic conditions and strong geographical variability across river basins,
yet accurate and reliable forecasts are vital for flood management, hydropower
operation, and disaster preparedness. In this work, we propose a Matrix
Profile-based Weighted Ensemble (MPWE), a regime-switching framework that
dynamically captures covariant dependencies among multiple geographical model
forecasts while incorporating redundancy-aware weighting to balance
contributions across models. We evaluate MPWE using rainfall forecasts from
eight major basins in Vietnam, spanning five forecast horizons (1 hour and
accumulated rainfall over 12, 24, 48, 72, and 84 hours). Experimental results
show that MPWE consistently achieves lower mean and standard deviation of
prediction errors compared to geographical models and ensemble baselines,
demonstrating both improved accuracy and stability across basins and horizons.

Method: FoQuS记录完整数据集训练过程中每个样本的预测轨迹，基于训练动态构建三个重要性指标来选择核集

Result: 实验表明FoQuS在多个AMR数据集上仅使用1%-30%原始数据就能保持高识别精度和良好的跨架构泛化能力

Conclusion: FoQuS通过智能核集选择有效解决了深度学习AMR模型训练成本过高的问题，在保持性能的同时大幅降低计算开销

Abstract: Deep learning-based Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) model has made
significant progress with the support of large-scale labeled data. However,
when developing new models or performing hyperparameter tuning, the time and
energy consumption associated with repeated training using massive amounts of
data are often unbearable. To address the above challenges, we propose
\emph{FoQuS}, which approximates the effect of full training by selecting a
coreset from the original dataset, thereby significantly reducing training
overhead. Specifically, \emph{FoQuS} records the prediction trajectory of each
sample during full-dataset training and constructs three importance metrics
based on training dynamics. Experiments show that \emph{FoQuS} can maintain
high recognition accuracy and good cross-architecture generalization on
multiple AMR datasets using only 1\%-30\% of the original data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法依赖启发式策略，忽略了层间特征模式与任务性能的关键交互，导致泛化能力下降

Method: 将缓存分配重构为多目标优化问题，利用进化搜索动态配置各层预算，直接最大化下游任务性能

Result: 在11个任务上超越所有基线方法，在代码补全任务中仅使用1.5%原始预算就达到优于完整KV缓存的性能

Conclusion: 学习型压缩策略在KV缓存预算分配方面具有巨大潜力，EvolKV框架证明了自适应层间压缩的有效性

Abstract: Existing key-value (KV) cache compression methods typically rely on
heuristics, such as uniform cache allocation across layers or static eviction
policies, however, they ignore the critical interplays among layer-specific
feature patterns and task performance, which can lead to degraded
generalization. In this paper, we propose EvolKV, an adaptive framework for
layer-wise, task-driven KV cache compression that jointly optimizes the memory
efficiency and task performance. By reformulating cache allocation as a
multi-objective optimization problem, EvolKV leverages evolutionary search to
dynamically configure layer budgets while directly maximizing downstream
performance. Extensive experiments on 11 tasks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms all baseline methods across a wide range of KV cache budgets on
long-context tasks and surpasses heuristic baselines by up to 7 percentage
points on GSM8K. Notably, EvolKV achieves superior performance over the full KV
cache setting on code completion while utilizing only 1.5% of the original
budget, suggesting the untapped potential in learned compression strategies for
KV cache budget allocation.

Motivation: 强化学习算法在复杂稀疏奖励环境中需要长时间训练，现有加速技术如奖励塑形和课程学习需要领域专业知识且过于特定

Method: 采用学生-教师架构，使用LLM（Llama、Vicuna、DeepSeek）作为导师为RL算法（DQN、PPO、A2C）提供指导，并探索建议重用机制，在54种配置下进行实验

Result: LLM指导显著加速RL收敛同时保持可比的最优性能，建议重用机制进一步缩短训练时间但收敛动态稳定性降低

Conclusion: LLM指导总体上改善收敛效果，但其有效性对具体任务、RL算法和LLM模型组合敏感

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms often require long training to become
useful, especially in complex environments with sparse rewards. While
techniques like reward shaping and curriculum learning exist to accelerate
training, these are often extremely specific and require the developer's
professionalism and dedicated expertise in the problem's domain. Tackling this
challenge, in this study, we explore the effectiveness of pre-trained Large
Language Models (LLMs) as tutors in a student-teacher architecture with RL
algorithms, hypothesizing that LLM-generated guidance allows for faster
convergence. In particular, we explore the effectiveness of reusing the LLM's
advice on the RL's convergence dynamics. Through an extensive empirical
examination, which included 54 configurations, varying the RL algorithm (DQN,
PPO, A2C), LLM tutor (Llama, Vicuna, DeepSeek), and environment (Blackjack,
Snake, Connect Four), our results demonstrate that LLM tutoring significantly
accelerates RL convergence while maintaining comparable optimal performance.
Furthermore, the advice reuse mechanism shows a further improvement in training
duration but also results in less stable convergence dynamics. Our findings
suggest that LLM tutoring generally improves convergence, and its effectiveness
is sensitive to the specific task, RL algorithm, and LLM model combination.

Motivation: 现有MoE模型参数庞大，GPU内存需求高，专家卸载到CPU RAM的方法因缓存命中率低和加载延迟大导致推理速度显著下降

Method: 提出专家垂直分割机制（top和bottom段），缓存热点专家的top段以提高缓存命中率；预测下一层激活专家并预取；基于定点迭代的自适应缓存配置算法

Result: 实验表明MoEpic可节省约50%的GPU成本，推理延迟比基线降低37.51%-65.73%

Conclusion: MoEpic通过创新的专家分割和智能预取策略，有效解决了MoE模型推理中的内存和性能瓶颈问题

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising architecture for modern
large language models (LLMs). However, massive parameters impose heavy GPU
memory (i.e., VRAM) demands, hindering the widespread adoption of MoE LLMs.
Offloading the expert parameters to CPU RAM offers an effective way to
alleviate the VRAM requirements for MoE inference. Existing approaches
typically cache a small subset of experts in VRAM and dynamically prefetch
experts from RAM during inference, leading to significant degradation in
inference speed due to the poor cache hit rate and substantial expert loading
latency. In this work, we propose MoEpic, an efficient MoE inference system
with a novel expert split mechanism. Specifically, each expert is vertically
divided into two segments: top and bottom. MoEpic caches the top segment of hot
experts, so that more experts will be stored under the limited VRAM budget,
thereby improving the cache hit rate. During each layer's inference, MoEpic
predicts and prefetches the activated experts for the next layer. Since the top
segments of cached experts are exempt from fetching, the loading time is
reduced, which allows efficient transfer-computation overlap. Nevertheless, the
performance of MoEpic critically depends on the cache configuration (i.e., each
layer's VRAM budget and expert split ratio). To this end, we propose a
divide-and-conquer algorithm based on fixed-point iteration for adaptive cache
configuration. Extensive experiments on popular MoE LLMs demonstrate that
MoEpic can save about half of the GPU cost, while lowering the inference
latency by about 37.51%-65.73% compared to the baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预测聚焦学习(PFL)和决策聚焦学习(DFL)各有局限：PFL忽视下游决策质量，DFL训练不稳定且收敛困难。需要结合两者优势的方法

Method: 使用预测损失梯度扰动决策损失梯度来构建更新方向，通过sigmoid衰减参数让预测损失梯度引导决策损失梯度训练预测模型

Result: 在三个随机优化问题上验证了方法的有效性，相比基线方法实现了更低的遗憾值和更稳定的训练，在PFL或DFL单独表现不佳的情况下仍能取得良好效果

Conclusion: 提出的方法无需额外训练，可与任何DFL求解器集成，在理论上保证收敛到帕累托稳定点，实验证明能够平衡决策质量和训练稳定性

Abstract: Decision-making under uncertainty is often considered in two stages:
predicting the unknown parameters, and then optimizing decisions based on
predictions. While traditional prediction-focused learning (PFL) treats these
two stages separately, decision-focused learning (DFL) trains the predictive
model by directly optimizing the decision quality in an end-to-end manner.
However, despite using exact or well-approximated gradients, vanilla DFL often
suffers from unstable convergence due to its flat-and-sharp loss landscapes. In
contrast, PFL yields more stable optimization, but overlooks the downstream
decision quality. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective approach:
perturbing the decision loss gradient using the prediction loss gradient to
construct an update direction. Our method requires no additional training and
can be integrated with any DFL solvers. Using the sigmoid-like decaying
parameter, we let the prediction loss gradient guide the decision loss gradient
to train a predictive model that optimizes decision quality. Also, we provide a
theoretical convergence guarantee to Pareto stationary point under mild
assumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate our method across three stochastic
optimization problems, showing promising results compared to other baselines.
We validate that our approach achieves lower regret with more stable training,
even in situations where either PFL or DFL struggles.

Motivation: 针对联邦源自由领域自适应(FFREEDA)中存在的类别不平衡、领域偏移和客户端数据非独立同分布等现实挑战，传统方法效果有限，需要探索更有效的解决方案。

Method: 使用冻结的视觉基础模型(VFM)作为特征提取器，替代原有的FFREEDA骨干网络，无需大量参数调优，同时减少联邦学习中的计算和通信开销。

Result: 实验结果表明，VFM能有效缓解领域差距、类别不平衡以及目标客户端间的非IID性问题，显著提高了整体准确率。

Conclusion: 强大的特征提取器比复杂的自适应或联邦学习方法更关键，视觉基础模型为现实世界联邦学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a framework for training models
collaboratively while preserving data privacy of each client. Recently,
research has focused on Federated Source-Free Domain Adaptation (FFREEDA), a
more realistic scenario wherein client-held target domain data remains
unlabeled, and the server can access source domain data only during
pre-training. We extend this framework to a more complex and realistic setting:
Class Imbalanced FFREEDA (CI-FFREEDA), which takes into account class
imbalances in both the source and target domains, as well as label shifts
between source and target and among target clients. The replication of existing
methods in our experimental setup lead us to rethink the focus from enhancing
aggregation and domain adaptation methods to improving the feature extractors
within the network itself. We propose replacing the FFREEDA backbone with a
frozen vision foundation model (VFM), thereby improving overall accuracy
without extensive parameter tuning and reducing computational and communication
costs in federated learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that VFMs
effectively mitigate the effects of domain gaps, class imbalances, and even
non-IID-ness among target clients, suggesting that strong feature extractors,
not complex adaptation or FL methods, are key to success in the real-world FL.

Result: 在实际LLM输出上实现了24-35倍的延迟降低，并提供了强烈的理论保证（全局收敛到唯一两级固定点）

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了隐私保护文本生成的实用性，为安全AI推理提供了高效的数学基础

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) power modern AI applications, but processing
sensitive data on untrusted servers raises privacy concerns. Homomorphic
encryption (HE) enables computation on encrypted data for secure inference.
However, neural text generation requires decoding methods like argmax and
sampling, which are non-polynomial and thus computationally expensive under
encryption, creating a significant performance bottleneck. We introduce cutmax,
an HE-friendly argmax algorithm that reduces ciphertext operations compared to
prior methods, enabling practical greedy decoding under encryption. We also
propose the first HE-compatible nucleus (top-p) sampling method, leveraging
cutmax for efficient stochastic decoding with provable privacy guarantees. Both
techniques are polynomial, supporting efficient inference in privacy-preserving
settings. Moreover, their differentiability facilitates gradient-based
sequence-level optimization as a polynomial alternative to straight-through
estimators. We further provide strong theoretical guarantees for cutmax,
proving it converges globally to a unique two-level fixed point, independent of
the input values beyond the identity of the maximizer, which explains its rapid
convergence in just a few iterations. Evaluations on realistic LLM outputs show
latency reductions of 24x-35x over baselines, advancing secure text generation.

Motivation: 图基础模型在处理多领域图数据时存在领域泛化冲突，具体表现为模型退化（编码器无法捕获输入多样性）和表示坍塌（隐藏嵌入无法保持语义可分性），这些问题源于信息瓶颈和正则化不足。

Result: 在6个领域的22个数据集上的实验表明，MoT在有监督、少样本和零样本场景下均显著优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: MoT作为一种灵活架构，遵循图基础模型的缩放定律，能够提供可控的模型规模，有效解决了图基础模型优化中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Graph foundation models, inspired by the success of LLMs, are designed to
learn the optimal embedding from multi-domain TAGs for the downstream
cross-task generalization capability. During our investigation, graph VQ-MAE
stands out among the increasingly diverse landscape of GFM architectures. This
is attributed to its ability to jointly encode topology and textual attributes
from multiple domains into discrete embedding spaces with clear semantic
boundaries. Despite its potential, domain generalization conflicts cause
imperceptible pitfalls. In this paper, we instantiate two of them, and they are
just like two sides of the same GFM optimization coin - Side 1 Model
Degradation: The encoder and codebook fail to capture the diversity of inputs;
Side 2 Representation Collapse: The hidden embedding and codebook vector fail
to preserve semantic separability due to constraints from narrow representation
subspaces. These two pitfalls (sides) collectively impair the decoder and
generate the low-quality reconstructed supervision, causing the GFM
optimization dilemma during pre-training (coin). Through empirical
investigation, we attribute the above challenges to Information Bottleneck and
Regularization Deficit. To address them, we propose MoT (Mixture-of-Tinkers) -
(1) Information Tinker for Two Pitfalls, which utilizes an edge-wise semantic
fusion strategy and a mixture-of-codebooks with domain-aware routing to improve
information capacity. (2) Regularization Tinker for Optimization Coin, which
utilizes two additional regularizations to further improve gradient supervision
in our proposed Information Tinker. Notably, as a flexible architecture, MoT
adheres to the scaling laws of GFM, offering a controllable model scale.
Compared to SOTA baselines, experiments on 22 datasets across 6 domains
demonstrate that MoT achieves significant improvements in supervised, few-shot,
and zero-shot scenarios.

Method: 使用预训练生成模型对每个真实数据样本生成条件化合成数据，实现数据匿名化和去毒化

Result: GDR在数据集匿名化方面优于工业级解决方案，能直接对高度不安全数据集进行去毒处理，保持网络规模数据集的多样性

Conclusion: GDR的简单性和有效性使其成为扩展前沿模型训练数据总量的强大工具

Abstract: For a fixed parameter size, the capabilities of large models are primarily
determined by the quality and quantity of its training data. Consequently,
training datasets now grow faster than the rate at which new data is indexed on
the web, leading to projected data exhaustion over the next decade. Much more
data exists as user-generated content that is not publicly indexed, but
incorporating such data comes with considerable risks, such as leaking private
information and other undesirable content. We introduce a framework, Generative
Data Refinement (GDR), for using pretrained generative models to transform a
dataset with undesirable content into a refined dataset that is more suitable
for training. Our experiments show that GDR can outperform industry-grade
solutions for dataset anonymization, as well as enable direct detoxification of
highly unsafe datasets. Moreover, we show that by generating synthetic data
that is conditioned on each example in the real dataset, GDR's refined outputs
naturally match the diversity of web scale datasets, and thereby avoid the
often challenging task of generating diverse synthetic data via model
prompting. The simplicity and effectiveness of GDR make it a powerful tool for
scaling up the total stock of training data for frontier models.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
remarkable capacity to process and reason over structured and unstructured data
modalities beyond natural language. In this work, we explore the applications
of Vision Language Models (VLMs), specifically a fine-tuned variant of LLaMa
3.2, to the task of identifying neutrino interactions in pixelated detector
data from high-energy physics (HEP) experiments. We benchmark this model
against a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture,
similar to those used in the NOvA and DUNE experiments, which have achieved
high efficiency and purity in classifying electron and muon neutrino events.
Our evaluation considers both the classification performance and
interpretability of the model predictions. We find that VLMs can outperform
CNNs, while also providing greater flexibility in integrating auxiliary textual
or semantic information and offering more interpretable, reasoning-based
predictions. This work highlights the potential of VLMs as a general-purpose
backbone for physics event classification, due to their high performance,
interpretability, and generalizability, which opens new avenues for integrating
multimodal reasoning in experimental neutrino physics.

Abstract: Developing autonomous LLM agents capable of making a series of intelligent
decisions to solve complex, real-world tasks is a fast-evolving frontier. Like
human cognitive development, agents are expected to acquire knowledge and
skills through exploration and interaction with the environment. Despite
advances, the community still lacks a unified, interactive reinforcement
learning (RL) framework that can effectively train such agents from scratch --
without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) -- across diverse and realistic
environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentGym-RL, a new framework to
train LLM agents for multi-turn interactive decision-making through RL. The
framework features a modular and decoupled architecture, ensuring high
flexibility and extensibility. It encompasses a wide variety of real-world
scenarios, and supports mainstream RL algorithms. Furthermore, we propose
ScalingInter-RL, a training approach designed for exploration-exploitation
balance and stable RL optimization. In early stages, it emphasizes exploitation
by restricting the number of interactions, and gradually shifts towards
exploration with larger horizons to encourage diverse problem-solving
strategies. In this way, the agent develops more diverse behaviors and is less
prone to collapse under long horizons. We perform extensive experiments to
validate the stability and effectiveness of both the AgentGym-RL framework and
the ScalingInter-RL approach. Our agents match or surpass commercial models on
27 tasks across diverse environments. We offer key insights and will
open-source the complete AgentGym-RL framework -- including code and datasets
-- to empower the research community in developing the next generation of
intelligent agents.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Actuarial Neural Additive Model, an inherently
interpretable deep learning model for general insurance pricing that offers
fully transparent and interpretable results while retaining the strong
predictive power of neural networks. This model assigns a dedicated neural
network (or subnetwork) to each individual covariate and pairwise interaction
term to independently learn its impact on the modeled output while implementing
various architectural constraints to allow for essential interpretability (e.g.
sparsity) and practical requirements (e.g. smoothness, monotonicity) in
insurance applications. The development of our model is grounded in a solid
foundation, where we establish a concrete definition of interpretability within
the insurance context, complemented by a rigorous mathematical framework.
Comparisons in terms of prediction accuracy are made with traditional actuarial
and state-of-the-art machine learning methods using both synthetic and real
insurance datasets. The results show that the proposed model outperforms other
methods in most cases while offering complete transparency in its internal
logic, underscoring the strong interpretability and predictive capability.

Conclusion: SHAining方法能够系统评估事件日志特征对流程挖掘算法性能的影响，为算法选择和评估提供了更全面的分析框架。

Abstract: Process mining aims to extract and analyze insights from event logs, yet
algorithm metric results vary widely depending on structural event log
characteristics. Existing work often evaluates algorithms on a fixed set of
real-world event logs but lacks a systematic analysis of how event log
characteristics impact algorithms individually. Moreover, since event logs are
generated from processes, where characteristics co-occur, we focus on
associational rather than causal effects to assess how strong the overlapping
individual characteristic affects evaluation metrics without assuming isolated
causal effects, a factor often neglected by prior work. We introduce SHAining,
the first approach to quantify the marginal contribution of varying event log
characteristics to process mining algorithms' metrics. Using process discovery
as a downstream task, we analyze over 22,000 event logs covering a wide span of
characteristics to uncover which affect algorithms across metrics (e.g.,
fitness, precision, complexity) the most. Furthermore, we offer novel insights
about how the value of event log characteristics correlates with their
contributed impact, assessing the algorithm's robustness.

TL;DR: MoT是一个轻量级框架，通过交替进行教师特定监督微调和权重空间合并，将多个教师的推理能力统一到学生模型中，在仅使用约200个高质量CoT样本的情况下，在数学竞赛基准上超越了多个强大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推理蒸馏方法假设单一最优教师，但实践中存在多个候选教师和不断增长的CoT语料库。研究发现不同学生有不同"最佳教师"，同一学生的最佳教师在不同数据集上也会变化。

Method: 提出Merge-of-Thought Distillation (MoT)框架，交替进行教师特定的监督微调分支和结果学生变体的权重空间合并，以统一多个教师的推理能力并克服监督冲突。

Result: 在数学竞赛基准上，仅使用约200个高质量CoT样本，MoT应用于Qwen3-14B学生模型超越了DEEPSEEK-R1、QWEN3-30B-A3B等多个强大模型，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: MoT持续优于最佳单教师蒸馏和朴素多教师联合方法，提高了性能上限同时减轻过拟合，对分布偏移和同级教师表现出鲁棒性，减少了灾难性遗忘，改善了数学之外的通用推理能力，甚至培养出更好的教师。

Abstract: Efficient reasoning distillation for long chain-of-thought (CoT) models is
increasingly constrained by the assumption of a single oracle teacher, despite
practical availability of multiple candidate teachers and growing CoT corpora.
We revisit teacher selection and observe that different students have different
"best teachers," and even for the same student the best teacher can vary across
datasets. Therefore, to unify multiple teachers' reasoning abilities into
student with overcoming conflicts among various teachers' supervision, we
propose Merge-of-Thought Distillation (MoT), a lightweight framework that
alternates between teacher-specific supervised fine-tuning branches and
weight-space merging of the resulting student variants. On competition math
benchmarks, using only about 200 high-quality CoT samples, applying MoT to a
Qwen3-14B student surpasses strong models including DEEPSEEK-R1, QWEN3-30B-A3B,
QWEN3-32B, and OPENAI-O1, demonstrating substantial gains. Besides, MoT
consistently outperforms the best single-teacher distillation and the naive
multi-teacher union, raises the performance ceiling while mitigating
overfitting, and shows robustness to distribution-shifted and peer-level
teachers. Moreover, MoT reduces catastrophic forgetting, improves general
reasoning beyond mathematics and even cultivates a better teacher, indicating
that consensus-filtered reasoning features transfer broadly. These results
position MoT as a simple, scalable route to efficiently distilling long CoT
capabilities from diverse teachers into compact students.

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过对比十种优化器在心脏病预测任务中的性能，发现RMSProp在收敛速度、精度、召回率和AUC等关键指标上表现最佳，建议通过综合评估来选择优化器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型训练中优化器选择得到的关注较少，需要深入研究优化器选择的标准和指标。

Method: 使用心脏病数据集训练简单的多层感知机模型，在一致的训练范式下对比10种优化器的性能，评估收敛速度、稳定性以及AUC、精度、召回率等分类指标。

Result: RMSProp在关键指标上表现最佳：精度0.765、召回率0.827、AUC 0.841，训练时间更快。Adagrad和Adadelta更稳定但收敛更慢。优化器选择存在收敛速度与稳定性的交换。

Conclusion: 建议在计算资源不受限制的环境中，通过综合评估各种优化器的性能来选择最佳优化器，以提高深度学习模型训练的科学性和性能。

Abstract: Optimization has been an important factor and topic of interest in training
deep learning models, yet less attention has been given to how we select the
optimizers we use to train these models. Hence, there is a need to dive deeper
into how we select the optimizers we use for training and the metrics that
determine this selection. In this work, we compare the performance of 10
different optimizers in training a simple Multi-layer Perceptron model using a
heart disease dataset from Kaggle. We set up a consistent training paradigm and
evaluate the optimizers based on metrics such as convergence speed and
stability. We also include some other Machine Learning Evaluation metrics such
as AUC, Precision, and Recall, which are central metrics to classification
problems. Our results show that there are trade-offs between convergence speed
and stability, as optimizers like Adagrad and Adadelta, which are more stable,
took longer time to converge. Across all our metrics, we chose RMSProp to be
the most effective optimizer for this heart disease prediction task because it
offered a balanced performance across key metrics. It achieved a precision of
0.765, a recall of 0.827, and an AUC of 0.841, along with faster training time.
However, it was not the most stable. We recommend that, in less
compute-constrained environments, this method of choosing optimizers through a
thorough evaluation should be adopted to increase the scientific nature and
performance in training deep learning models.

Conclusion: 结构化潜在表示对算子学习至关重要，生成模型与算子网络的结合在热设计和更广泛工程应用中具有巨大潜力

Abstract: Generative thermal design for complex geometries is fundamental in many areas
of engineering, yet it faces two main challenges: the high computational cost
of high-fidelity simulations and the limitations of conventional generative
models. Approaches such as autoencoders (AEs) and variational autoencoders
(VAEs) often produce unstructured latent spaces with discontinuities, which
restricts their capacity to explore designs and generate physically consistent
solutions.
  To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework that combines
Variational Rank-Reduction Autoencoders (VRRAEs) with Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONets). The VRRAE introduces a truncated SVD within the latent space,
leading to continuous, interpretable, and well-structured representations that
mitigate posterior collapse and improve geometric reconstruction. The DeepONet
then exploits this compact latent encoding in its branch network, together with
spatial coordinates in the trunk network, to predict temperature gradients
efficiently and accurately.
  This hybrid approach not only enhances the quality of generated geometries
and the accuracy of gradient prediction, but also provides a substantial
advantage in inference efficiency compared to traditional numerical solvers.
Overall, the study underscores the importance of structured latent
representations for operator learning and highlights the potential of combining
generative models and operator networks in thermal design and broader
engineering applications.

Abstract: In this work, we focus on the efficiency and scalability of pairwise
constraint-based active clustering, crucial for processing large-scale data in
applications such as data mining, knowledge annotation, and AI model
pre-training. Our goals are threefold: (1) to reduce computational costs for
iterative clustering updates; (2) to enhance the impact of user-provided
constraints to minimize annotation requirements for precise clustering; and (3)
to cut down memory usage in practical deployments. To achieve these aims, we
propose a graph-based active clustering algorithm that utilizes two sparse
graphs: one for representing relationships between data (our proposed data
skeleton) and another for updating this data skeleton. These two graphs work in
concert, enabling the refinement of connected subgraphs within the data
skeleton to create nested clusters. Our empirical analysis confirms that the
proposed algorithm consistently facilitates more accurate clustering with
dramatically less input of user-provided constraints, and outperforms its
counterparts in terms of computational performance and scalability, while
maintaining robustness across various distance metrics.

Conclusion: MAESTRO提供了一个强大的统一框架，展示了先进的频谱-时间建模和多模态数据融合在流行病学预测中的关键协同作用，其模块化和可复现的管道便于部署和扩展到其他地区和病原体。

Abstract: Timely and robust influenza incidence forecasting is critical for public
health decision-making. To address this, we present MAESTRO, a Multi-modal
Adaptive Ensemble for Spectro-Temporal Robust Optimization. MAESTRO achieves
robustness by adaptively fusing multi-modal inputs-including surveillance, web
search trends, and meteorological data-and leveraging a comprehensive
spectro-temporal architecture. The model first decomposes time series into
seasonal and trend components. These are then processed through a hybrid
feature enhancement pipeline combining Transformer-based encoders, a Mamba
state-space model for long-range dependencies, multi-scale temporal
convolutions, and a frequency-domain analysis module. A cross-channel attention
mechanism further integrates information across the different data modalities.
Finally, a temporal projection head performs sequence-to-sequence forecasting,
with an optional estimator to quantify prediction uncertainty. Evaluated on
over 11 years of Hong Kong influenza data (excluding the COVID-19 period),
MAESTRO shows strong competitive performance, demonstrating a superior model
fit and relative accuracy, achieving a state-of-the-art R-square of 0.956.
Extensive ablations confirm the significant contributions of both multi-modal
fusion and the spectro-temporal components. Our modular and reproducible
pipeline is made publicly available to facilitate deployment and extension to
other regions and pathogens.Our publicly available pipeline presents a
powerful, unified framework, demonstrating the critical synergy of advanced
spectro-temporal modeling and multi-modal data fusion for robust
epidemiological forecasting.

TL;DR: 论文主张将可解释性特别是机制性方法作为AI对齐的核心设计原则，而非辅助诊断工具，认为这是实现安全可信AI的关键


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型神经网络在关键场景部署时存在与人类价值观对齐的可靠性问题，需要内部透明性来确保系统行为符合人类意图

Method: 区分事后解释方法（如LIME、SHAP）和机制性技术（如电路追踪、激活修补），后者能提供对内部故障的因果洞察

Result: 机制性可解释性方法能够发现行为方法（如RLHF、红队测试）可能忽略的欺骗性或未对齐推理模式

Conclusion: AI安全和可信赖的进展取决于将可解释性作为AI研发的一等目标，确保系统不仅有效而且可审计、透明且与人类意图对齐

Abstract: Large neural models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes settings,
raising concerns about whether their behavior reliably aligns with human
values. Interpretability provides a route to internal transparency by revealing
the computations that drive outputs. We argue that interpretability especially
mechanistic approaches should be treated as a design principle for alignment,
not an auxiliary diagnostic tool. Post-hoc methods such as LIME or SHAP offer
intuitive but correlational explanations, while mechanistic techniques like
circuit tracing or activation patching yield causal insight into internal
failures, including deceptive or misaligned reasoning that behavioral methods
like RLHF, red teaming, or Constitutional AI may overlook. Despite these
advantages, interpretability faces challenges of scalability, epistemic
uncertainty, and mismatches between learned representations and human concepts.
Our position is that progress on safe and trustworthy AI will depend on making
interpretability a first-class objective of AI research and development,
ensuring that systems are not only effective but also auditable, transparent,
and aligned with human intent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较深度学习和传统机器学习算法在分类24小时运动行为（睡眠、坐着、轻强度和中高强度运动）方面的性能差异

Method: 使用151名成年人的腕部加速度计数据，采用4种DL算法（LSTM、BiLSTM、GRU、1D-CNN）和6种传统ML算法（RF、SVM、XGBoost、LR、ANN、DT），分别使用原始信号和手工特征进行训练

Result: DL算法使用原始信号达到85%准确度，而使用手工特征时准确度为70-81%。中高强度运动和轻强度运动的分类错误较多

Conclusion: 深度学习算法使用原始加速度信号在24小时运动行为分类中仅略好于传统机器学习算法，性能提升不明显

Abstract: Purpose: We compared the performance of deep learning (DL) and classical
machine learning (ML) algorithms for the classification of 24-hour movement
behavior into sleep, sedentary, light intensity physical activity (LPA), and
moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA). Methods: Open-access
data from 151 adults wearing a wrist-worn accelerometer (Axivity-AX3) was used.
Participants were randomly divided into training, validation, and test sets
(121, 15, and 15 participants each). Raw acceleration signals were segmented
into non-overlapping 10-second windows, and then a total of 104 handcrafted
features were extracted. Four DL algorithms-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and
One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN)-were trained using raw
acceleration signals and with handcrafted features extracted from these signals
to predict 24-hour movement behavior categories. The handcrafted features were
also used to train classical ML algorithms, namely Random Forest (RF), Support
Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Logistic Regression
(LR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Decision Tree (DT) for classifying
24-hour movement behavior intensities. Results: LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU showed an
overall accuracy of approximately 85% when trained with raw acceleration
signals, and 1D-CNN an overall accuracy of approximately 80%. When trained on
handcrafted features, the overall accuracy for both DL and classical ML
algorithms ranged from 70% to 81%. Overall, there was a higher confusion in
classification of MVPA and LPA, compared to sleep and sedentary categories.
Conclusion: DL methods with raw acceleration signals had only slightly better
performance in predicting 24-hour movement behavior intensities, compared to
when DL and classical ML were trained with handcrafted features.

Abstract: Tabular data is the foundation of many applications in fields such as finance

predictive performance, they are blackboxes with little interpretability. We
introduce XNNTab, a neural architecture that uses a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to
learn a dictionary of monosemantic features within the latent space used for
prediction. Using an automated method, we assign human-interpretable semantics
to these features. This allows us to represent predictions as linear
combinations of semantically meaningful components. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that XNNTab attains performance on par with or exceeding that of
state-of-the-art, black-box neural models and classical machine learning
approaches while being fully interpretable.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的方法来计算零形系数的数据依赖上界，解决了传统上界1通常无法达到的问题，为聚类质量评估提供了更准确的标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零形系数的标准上界1通常无法达到，导致聚类质量评估不准确。需要一种数据依赖的上界来评估聚类结果距离最佳情况的接近程度。

Method: 通过求解每个数据点的零形宽度的严格上界，然后聚合这些个体上界得到平均零形宽度(ASW)的数据依赖上界。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，该上界在许多情况下都被证明是近优的，且值通常远低于1，为聚类质量评估提供了重要丰富。

Conclusion: 该方法能够指示单个数据点是否可能被良好分配，支持零形基优化循环的提前停止，并回答聚类结果距离该数据集上最佳情况的接近程度。

Abstract: The silhouette coefficient summarizes, per observation, cohesion versus
separation in [-1, 1]; the average silhouette width (ASW) is a common internal
measure of clustering quality where higher values indicate more coveted
results. However, the dataset-specific maximum of ASW is typically unknown, and
the standard upper limit 1 is often unattainable. In this work, we derive for
each data point in a given dataset a sharp upper bound on its silhouette width.
By aggregating these individual bounds, we present a canonical data-dependent
upper bound on ASW that often assumes values well below 1. The presented bounds
can indicate whether individual data points can ever be well placed, enable
early stopping of silhouette-based optimization loops, and help answer a key
question: How close is my clustering result to the best possible outcome on
this specific data? Across synthetic and real datasets, the bounds are provably
near-tight in many cases and offer significant enrichment of cluster quality
evaluation.

Abstract: Replication of experimental results has been a challenge faced by many
scientific disciplines, including the field of machine learning. Recent work on
the theory of machine learning has formalized replicability as the demand that
an algorithm produce identical outcomes when executed twice on different
samples from the same distribution. Provably replicable algorithms are
especially interesting for reinforcement learning (RL), where algorithms are
known to be unstable in practice. While replicable algorithms exist for tabular
RL settings, extending these guarantees to more practical function
approximation settings has remained an open problem. In this work, we make
progress by developing replicable methods for linear function approximation in
RL. We first introduce two efficient algorithms for replicable random design
regression and uncentered covariance estimation, each of independent interest.
We then leverage these tools to provide the first provably efficient replicable
RL algorithms for linear Markov decision processes in both the generative model
and episodic settings. Finally, we evaluate our algorithms experimentally and
show how they can inspire more consistent neural policies.

Motivation: 电子健康记录(EHR)训练的机器学习模型在跨医疗系统时因分布偏移而性能下降，诊断信号衰减(诊断质量和一致性的变异性)是一个重要但未被充分探索的因素

Method: 构建模拟框架生成2,500个合成数据集，开发包含六个可解释组件的SFI指标(诊断特异性、时间一致性、熵、上下文一致性、药物对齐和轨迹稳定性)，应用SFI感知校准进行乘法调整优化

Conclusion: 诊断信号衰减是模型泛化的可处理障碍，SFI感知校准提供了一种实用的无标签策略，可在缺乏结果标签的大规模管理数据集中增强跨医疗环境的预测能力

Abstract: \textbf{Background:} Machine learning models trained on electronic health
records (EHRs) often degrade across healthcare systems due to distributional
shift. A fundamental but underexplored factor is diagnostic signal decay:
variability in diagnostic quality and consistency across institutions, which
affects the reliability of codes used for training and prediction.
  \textbf{Objective:} To develop a Signal Fidelity Index (SFI) quantifying
diagnostic data quality at the patient level in dementia, and to test SFI-aware
calibration for improving model performance across heterogeneous datasets
without outcome labels.
  \textbf{Methods:} We built a simulation framework generating 2,500 synthetic
datasets, each with 1,000 patients and realistic demographics, encounters, and
coding patterns based on dementia risk factors. The SFI was derived from six
interpretable components: diagnostic specificity, temporal consistency,
entropy, contextual concordance, medication alignment, and trajectory
stability. SFI-aware calibration applied a multiplicative adjustment, optimized
across 50 simulation batches.
  \textbf{Results:} At the optimal parameter ($\alpha$ = 2.0), SFI-aware
calibration significantly improved all metrics (p $<$ 0.001). Gains ranged from
10.3\% for Balanced Accuracy to 32.5\% for Recall, with notable increases in
Precision (31.9\%) and F1-score (26.1\%). Performance approached reference
standards, with F1-score and Recall within 1\% and Balanced Accuracy and
Detection Rate improved by 52.3\% and 41.1\%, respectively.
  \textbf{Conclusions:} Diagnostic signal decay is a tractable barrier to model
generalization. SFI-aware calibration provides a practical, label-free strategy
to enhance prediction across healthcare contexts, particularly for large-scale
administrative datasets lacking outcome labels.

Conclusion: 基于托默空间的安全聚合协议是更安全的选择，既避免了精度损失，又实现了完美隐私。

Abstract: In federated learning, multiple parties train models locally and share their
parameters with a central server, which aggregates them to update a global
model. To address the risk of exposing sensitive data through local models,
secure aggregation via secure multiparty computation has been proposed to
enhance privacy. At the same time, perfect privacy can only be achieved by a
uniform distribution of the masked local models to be aggregated. This raises a
problem when working with real valued data, as there is no measure on the reals
that is invariant under the masking operation, and hence information leakage is
bound to occur. Shifting the data to a finite field circumvents this problem,
but as a downside runs into an inherent accuracy complexity tradeoff issue due
to fixed point modular arithmetic as opposed to floating point numbers that can
simultaneously handle numbers of varying magnitudes. In this paper, a novel
secure parameter aggregation method is proposed that employs the torus rather
than a finite field. This approach guarantees perfect privacy for each party's
data by utilizing the uniform distribution on the torus, while avoiding
accuracy losses. Experimental results show that the new protocol performs
similarly to the model without secure aggregation while maintaining perfect
privacy. Compared to the finite field secure aggregation, the torus-based
protocol can in some cases significantly outperform it in terms of model
accuracy and cosine similarity, hence making it a safer choice.

TL;DR: FAUST算法通过将Forward-Forward算法与相似性学习框架结合，消除了推理时多次前向传播的需求，显著提升了准确率并接近反向传播的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Forward-Forward算法在准确率上远落后于反向传播，且推理效率低（需要多次前向传播）的问题

Method: 将Forward-Forward算法与基于相似性的Tuplet损失函数框架整合，提出FAUST算法

Result: 在MNIST、Fashion-MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上显著提升准确率，CIFAR-10上达到56.22%（反向传播基准为57.63%）

Conclusion: FAUST成功缩小了Forward-Forward与反向传播之间的性能差距，同时保持了生物合理性优势

Abstract: Backpropagation is the pivotal algorithm underpinning the success of
artificial neural networks, yet it has critical limitations such as
biologically implausible backward locking and global error propagation. To
circumvent these constraints, the Forward-Forward algorithm was proposed as a
more biologically plausible method that replaces the backward pass with an
additional forward pass. Despite this advantage, the Forward-Forward algorithm
significantly trails backpropagation in accuracy, and its optimal form exhibits
low inference efficiency due to multiple forward passes required. In this work,
the Forward-Forward algorithm is reshaped through its integration with
similarity learning frameworks, eliminating the need for multiple forward
passes during inference. This proposed algorithm is named Forward-Forward
Algorithm Unified with Similarity-based Tuplet loss (FAUST). Empirical
evaluations on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets indicate that FAUST
substantially improves accuracy, narrowing the gap with backpropagation. On
CIFAR-10, FAUST achieves 56.22\% accuracy with a simple multi-layer perceptron
architecture, approaching the backpropagation benchmark of 57.63\% accuracy.

Motivation: 随着IT系统复杂性增加，DevOps团队在系统维护和故障解决方面面临挑战，日志分析作为AIOps的核心组成部分可以提供关键见解。

Method: 设计了一种三层架构：1）日志调查层：自主日志标签和异常分类；2）异常检测层：适用于无监督、弱监督和有监督训练的灵活方法；3）根因分析层：识别描述故障的最小日志集、起源和事件序列。

Abstract: In the evolving IT landscape, stability and reliability of systems are
essential, yet their growing complexity challenges DevOps teams in
implementation and maintenance. Log analysis, a core element of AIOps, provides
critical insights into complex behaviors and failures. This dissertation
introduces a three-layered architecture to support DevOps in failure
resolution. The first layer, Log Investigation, performs autonomous log
labeling and anomaly classification. We propose a method that labels log data
without manual effort, enabling supervised training and precise evaluation of
anomaly detection. Additionally, we define a taxonomy that groups anomalies
into three categories, ensuring appropriate method selection. The second layer,
Anomaly Detection, detects behaviors deviating from the norm. We propose a
flexible Anomaly Detection method adaptable to unsupervised, weakly supervised,
and supervised training. Evaluations on public and industry datasets show
F1-scores between 0.98 and 1.0, ensuring reliable anomaly detection. The third
layer, Root Cause Analysis, identifies minimal log sets describing failures,
their origin, and event sequences. By balancing training data and identifying
key services, our Root Cause Analysis method consistently detects 90-98% of
root cause log lines within the top 10 candidates, providing actionable
insights for mitigation. Our research addresses how log analysis methods can be
designed and optimized to help DevOps resolve failures efficiently. By
integrating these three layers, the architecture equips teams with robust
methods to enhance IT system reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统电刺激映射(ESM)虽然临床金标准，但有创且耗时，需要开发非侵入性替代方法进行术前语言功能区定位

Method: 分析16名参与者的颅内脑电数据，整合神经活动信号、解剖区域标签和功能连接特征，使用RBF核SVM和MLP聚合进行电极级分类

Result: 最佳模型在独立测试集上表现优异(ROC-AUC: 0.87, PR-AUC: 0.57)，结合区域和连接特征的模型性能最优

Conclusion: 结合空间和网络信息的非线性建模能显著改善术前功能映射，为安全脑部手术提供重要工具

Abstract: Identifying cortical regions critical for speech is essential for safe brain
surgery in or near language areas. While Electrical Stimulation Mapping (ESM)
remains the clinical gold standard, it is invasive and time-consuming. To
address this, we analyzed intracranial electrocorticographic (ECoG) data from
16 participants performing speech tasks and developed machine learning models
to directly predict if the brain region underneath each ECoG electrode is
critical. Ground truth labels indicating speech arrest were derived
independently from Electrical Stimulation Mapping (ESM) and used to train
classification models. Our framework integrates neural activity signals,
anatomical region labels, and functional connectivity features to capture both
local activity and network-level dynamics. We found that models combining
region and connectivity features matched the performance of the full feature
set, and outperformed models using either type alone. To classify each
electrode, trial-level predictions were aggregated using an MLP applied to
histogram-encoded scores. Our best-performing model, a trial-level RBF-kernel
Support Vector Machine together with MLP-based aggregation, achieved strong
accuracy on held-out participants (ROC-AUC: 0.87, PR-AUC: 0.57). These findings
highlight the value of combining spatial and network information with
non-linear modeling to improve functional mapping in presurgical evaluation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种恶意安全DP-FTRL框架，通过临时TEE模块和客户端审计机制来防御恶意服务器攻击，同时保持系统可扩展性和低开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DP-FTRL方法假设半诚实服务器，无法应对实际场景中客户端退出或被腐蚀的情况。虽然TEE看似是解决方案，但直接实现会导致分叉攻击或可用性问题。

Method: 设计服务器端扩展作为可信计算基(TCB)，使用临时TEE模块生成服务器操作的可验证证明，部分客户端参与审计这些证明。

Result: 框架在恶意设置下提供形式化隐私保证，实验显示在多种实际设置中仅给客户端带来小的常数级开销。

Conclusion: 所提出的扩展解决方案在减小TCB大小的同时保持了系统的可扩展性和活跃性，成功实现了恶意安全的DP-FTRL。

Abstract: In cross-device private federated learning, differentially private
follow-the-regularized-leader (DP-FTRL) has emerged as a promising
privacy-preserving method. However, existing approaches assume a semi-honest
server and have not addressed the challenge of securely removing this
assumption. This is due to its statefulness, which becomes particularly
problematic in practical settings where clients can drop out or be corrupted.
While trusted execution environments (TEEs) might seem like an obvious
solution, a straightforward implementation can introduce forking attacks or
availability issues due to state management. To address this problem, our paper
introduces a novel server extension that acts as a trusted computing base (TCB)
to realize maliciously secure DP-FTRL. The TCB is implemented with an ephemeral
TEE module on the server side to produce verifiable proofs of server actions.
Some clients, upon being selected, participate in auditing these proofs with
small additional communication and computational demands. This extension
solution reduces the size of the TCB while maintaining the system's scalability
and liveness. We provide formal proofs based on interactive differential
privacy, demonstrating privacy guarantee in malicious settings. Finally, we
experimentally show that our framework adds small constant overhead to clients
in several realistic settings.

Result: 实验结果显示，混合方法能够显著降低模型的整体复杂性，而准确性与基准模型相比仅有最小程度的下降。在NVIDIA JETSON TX2嵌入式AI设备上部署时，复杂性降低转化为了更低的延迟。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的混合剪枝框架有效地减小了CNN模型的规模和复杂性，同时保持了良好的性能水平，为边缘设备上的模型部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved significant breakthroughs
in various fields. However, these advancements have led to a substantial
increase in the complexity and size of these networks. This poses a challenge
when deploying large and complex networks on edge devices. Consequently, model
compression has emerged as a research field aimed at reducing the size and
complexity of CNNs. One prominent technique in model compression is model
pruning. This paper will present a new technique of pruning that combines both
channel and layer pruning in what is called a "hybrid pruning framework".
Inspired by EfficientNet, a renowned CNN architecture known for scaling up
networks from both channel and layer perspectives, this hybrid approach applies
the same principles but in reverse, where it scales down the network through
pruning. Experiments on the hybrid approach demonstrated a notable decrease in
the overall complexity of the model, with only a minimal reduction in accuracy
compared to the baseline model. This complexity reduction translates into
reduced latency when deploying the pruned models on an NVIDIA JETSON TX2
embedded AI device.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL后训练需要大规模并行化推理，带来延迟、内存、可靠性等技术挑战和高昂成本，需要一种去中心化的解决方案。

Method: 提出Swarm sAmpling Policy Optimization (SAPO)算法，在异构计算节点网络中异步运行，每个节点管理自己的策略模型并与其他节点共享rollouts，无需假设延迟、模型同质性或硬件要求。

Result: 在受控实验中实现了高达94%的累积奖励增益，并在数千个节点的网络上进行了测试，验证了算法在多样化硬件和模型上的有效性。

Conclusion: SAPO成功解决了RL后训练的扩展瓶颈问题，为去中心化RL训练提供了新的可能性，并通过rollout共享实现了学习过程的引导。

Abstract: Post-training language models (LMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) can
enhance their complex reasoning capabilities without supervised fine-tuning, as
demonstrated by DeepSeek-R1-Zero. However, effectively utilizing RL for LMs
requires significant parallelization to scale-up inference, which introduces
non-trivial technical challenges (e.g. latency, memory, and reliability)
alongside ever-growing financial costs. We present Swarm sAmpling Policy
Optimization (SAPO), a fully decentralized and asynchronous RL post-training
algorithm. SAPO is designed for decentralized networks of heterogenous compute
nodes, where each node manages its own policy model(s) while "sharing" rollouts
with others in the network; no explicit assumptions about latency, model
homogeneity, or hardware are required and nodes can operate in silo if desired.
As a result, the algorithm avoids common bottlenecks in scaling RL
post-training while also allowing (and even encouraging) new possibilities. By
sampling rollouts "shared" across the network, it enables "Aha moments" to
propagate, thereby bootstrapping the learning process. In this paper we show
SAPO achieved cumulative reward gains of up to 94% in controlled experiments.
We also share insights from tests on a network with thousands of nodes
contributed by Gensyn community members running the algorithm on diverse
hardware and models during an open-source demo.

Conclusion: 利用分子动力学模拟的连续性特征，通过深度平衡模型重用中间特征，能够显著提升机器学习力场的性能和效率

Abstract: Machine learning force fields show great promise in enabling more accurate
molecular dynamics simulations compared to manually derived ones. Much of the
progress in recent years was driven by exploiting prior knowledge about
physical systems, in particular symmetries under rotation, translation, and
reflections. In this paper, we argue that there is another important piece of
prior information that, thus fa,r hasn't been explored: Simulating a molecular
system is necessarily continuous, and successive states are therefore extremely
similar. Our contribution is to show that we can exploit this information by
recasting a state-of-the-art equivariant base model as a deep equilibrium
model. This allows us to recycle intermediate neural network features from
previous time steps, enabling us to improve both accuracy and speed by
$10\%-20\%$ on the MD17, MD22, and OC20 200k datasets, compared to the non-DEQ
base model. The training is also much more memory efficient, allowing us to
train more expressive models on larger systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach to generating sample paths of unknown
stochastic differential equations (SDEs) using diffusion models, a class of
generative AI models commonly employed in image and video applications. Unlike
the traditional Monte Carlo methods for simulating SDEs, which require explicit
specifications of the drift and diffusion coefficients, our method takes a
model-free, data-driven approach. Given a finite set of sample paths from an
SDE, we utilize conditional diffusion models to generate new, synthetic paths
of the same SDE. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct a
simulation experiment to compare our method with alternative benchmark ones
including neural SDEs. Furthermore, in an empirical study we leverage these
synthetically generated sample paths to enhance the performance of
reinforcement learning algorithms for continuous-time mean-variance portfolio
selection, hinting promising applications of diffusion models in financial
analysis and decision-making.

Abstract: The efficiency of Bayesian optimization (BO) in chemistry is often hindered
by sparse experimental data and complex reaction mechanisms. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce ChemBOMAS, a new framework named LLM-Enhanced
Multi-Agent System for accelerating BO in chemistry. ChemBOMAS's optimization
process is enhanced by LLMs and synergistically employs two strategies:
knowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization and data-driven fine-grained
optimization. First, in the knowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization stage,
LLMs intelligently decompose the vast search space by reasoning over existing
chemical knowledge to identify promising candidate regions. Subsequently, in
the data-driven fine-grained optimization stage, LLMs enhance the BO process
within these candidate regions by generating pseudo-data points, thereby
improving data utilization efficiency and accelerating convergence. Benchmark
evaluations** further confirm that ChemBOMAS significantly enhances
optimization effectiveness and efficiency compared to various BO algorithms.
Importantly, the practical utility of ChemBOMAS was validated through wet-lab
experiments conducted under pharmaceutical industry protocols, targeting
conditional optimization for a previously unreported and challenging chemical
reaction. In the wet experiment, ChemBOMAS achieved an optimal objective value
of 96%. This was substantially higher than the 15% achieved by domain experts.
This real-world success, together with strong performance on benchmark
evaluations, highlights ChemBOMAS as a powerful tool to accelerate chemical
discovery.

developed and validated a deep reinforcement learning-based decision-support AI
agent to optimize patient transfer decisions during simulated MCIs by balancing
patient acuity levels, specialized care requirements, hospital capacities, and

non-experts), we evaluated three interaction approaches with the AI agent
(human-only, human-AI collaboration, and AI-only) across 20- and 60-patient MCI

involvement significantly improves decision quality and consistency. The AI
agent outperforms trauma surgeons (p < 0.001) and enables non-experts to
achieve expert-level performance when assisted, contrasting sharply with their
significantly inferior unassisted performance (p < 0.001). These findings
establish the potential for our AI-driven decision support to enhance both MCI

Abstract: Federating heterogeneous models on edge devices with diverse resource
constraints has been a notable trend in recent years. Compared to traditional
federated learning (FL) that assumes an identical model architecture to
cooperate, model-heterogeneous FL is more practical and flexible since the
model can be customized to satisfy the deployment requirement. Unfortunately,
no prior work ever dives into the existing model-heterogeneous FL algorithms
under the practical edge device constraints and provides quantitative analysis
on various data scenarios and metrics, which motivates us to rethink and
re-evaluate this paradigm. In our work, we construct the first system platform
\textbf{PracMHBench} to evaluate model-heterogeneous FL on practical
constraints of edge devices, where diverse model heterogeneity algorithms are
classified and tested on multiple data tasks and metrics. Based on the
platform, we perform extensive experiments on these algorithms under the
different edge constraints to observe their applicability and the corresponding
heterogeneity pattern.

Conclusion: FLM是第一个能够在多维空间中使用标准MLP架构表示完整可分离傅里叶基的神经网络，为科学计算问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce the Fourier Learning Machine (FLM), a neural network (NN)
architecture designed to represent a multidimensional nonharmonic Fourier
series. The FLM uses a simple feedforward structure with cosine activation
functions to learn the frequencies, amplitudes, and phase shifts of the series
as trainable parameters. This design allows the model to create a
problem-specific spectral basis adaptable to both periodic and nonperiodic
functions. Unlike previous Fourier-inspired NN models, the FLM is the first
architecture able to represent a complete, separable Fourier basis in multiple
dimensions using a standard Multilayer Perceptron-like architecture. A
one-to-one correspondence between the Fourier coefficients and amplitudes and
phase-shifts is demonstrated, allowing for the translation between a full,
separable basis form and the cosine phase--shifted one. Additionally, we
evaluate the performance of FLMs on several scientific computing problems,
including benchmark Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and a family of
Optimal Control Problems (OCPs). Computational experiments show that the
performance of FLMs is comparable, and often superior, to that of established
architectures like SIREN and vanilla feedforward NNs.

Abstract: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common brain disorder in
children that can persist into adulthood, affecting social, academic, and
career life. Early diagnosis is crucial for managing these impacts on patients
and the healthcare system but is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. This
paper presents a novel method to improve ADHD diagnosis precision and
timeliness by leveraging Deep Learning (DL) approaches and electroencephalogram
(EEG) signals. We introduce ADHDeepNet, a DL model that utilizes comprehensive
temporal-spatial characterization, attention modules, and explainability
techniques optimized for EEG signals. ADHDeepNet integrates feature extraction
and refinement processes to enhance ADHD diagnosis. The model was trained and
validated on a dataset of 121 participants (61 ADHD, 60 Healthy Controls),
employing nested cross-validation for robust performance. The proposed
two-stage methodology uses a 10-fold cross-subject validation strategy.
Initially, each iteration optimizes the model's hyper-parameters with inner
2-fold cross-validation. Then, Additive Gaussian Noise (AGN) with various
standard deviations and magnification levels is applied for data augmentation.
ADHDeepNet achieved 100% sensitivity and 99.17% accuracy in classifying ADHD/HC
subjects. To clarify model explainability and identify key brain regions and
frequency bands for ADHD diagnosis, we analyzed the learned weights and
activation patterns of the model's primary layers. Additionally, t-distributed
Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualized high-dimensional data, aiding
in interpreting the model's decisions. This study highlights the potential of
DL and EEG in enhancing ADHD diagnosis accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Honey bee colonies are essential for global food security and ecosystem
stability, yet they face escalating threats from pests, diseases, and
environmental stressors. Traditional hive inspections are labor-intensive and
disruptive, while cloud-based monitoring solutions remain impractical for
remote or resource-limited apiaries. Recent advances in Internet of Things
(IoT) and Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) enable low-power, real-time monitoring
directly on edge devices, offering scalable and non-invasive alternatives. This
survey synthesizes current innovations at the intersection of TinyML and
apiculture, organized around four key functional areas: monitoring hive
conditions, recognizing bee behaviors, detecting pests and diseases, and
forecasting swarming events. We further examine supporting resources, including
publicly available datasets, lightweight model architectures optimized for
embedded deployment, and benchmarking strategies tailored to field constraints.
Critical limitations such as data scarcity, generalization challenges, and
deployment barriers in off-grid environments are highlighted, alongside
emerging opportunities in ultra-efficient inference pipelines, adaptive edge
learning, and dataset standardization. By consolidating research and
engineering practices, this work provides a foundation for scalable, AI-driven,
and ecologically informed monitoring systems to support sustainable pollinator
management.
