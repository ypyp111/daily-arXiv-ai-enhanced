Existing diffusion-based portrait animation methods primarily\nfocus on lip synchronization or static emotion transformation, often\noverlooking dynamic styles such as head movements. Moreover, most of these\nmethods rely on a dual U-Net architecture, which preserves identity consistency\nbut incurs additional computational overhead. To this end, we propose DiTalker,\na unified DiT-based framework for speaking style-controllable portrait\nanimation. We design a Style-Emotion Encoding Module that employs two separate\nbranches: a style branch extracting identity-specific style information (e.g.,\nhead poses and movements), and an emotion branch extracting identity-agnostic\nemotion features. We further introduce an Audio-Style Fusion Module that\ndecouples audio and speaking styles via two parallel cross-attention layers,\nusing these features to guide the animation process. To enhance the quality of\nresults, we adopt and modify two optimization constraints: one to improve lip\nsynchronization and the other to preserve fine-grained identity and background\ndetails. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DiTalker in terms\nof lip synchronization and speaking style controllability.

We demonstrate the framework's versatility across diverse research\nscenarios, showcasing its application to atomic-resolution and hyperspectral\ndata, its capacity to integrate real-time human expert guidance, and its\nability to close the research loop by proposing targeted follow-up experiments.\nBy systematically analyzing all observations and contextualizing them, SciLink\nprovides a practical framework for AI-driven materials research that not only\nenhances efficiency but also actively cultivates an environment ripe for\nserendipitous discoveries, thereby bridging the gap between automated\nexperimentation and open-ended scientific exploration.", "AI": {"tldr": "SciLink\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u94fe\u63a5\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c2\u5bdf\u3001\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5728\u6750\u6599\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5076\u7136\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u5047\u8bbe\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u5ffd\u7565\u5076\u7136\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002SciLink\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u79d1\u5b66\u63a2\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u610f\u5916\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408AI\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u4e3b\u5f20\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u6587\u732e\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u3002", "result": "SciLink\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u7814\u7a76\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u539f\u5b50\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u8d85\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6574\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u540e\u7eed\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "conclusion": "SciLink\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u6240\u6709\u89c2\u5bdf\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u5076\u7136\u53d1\u73b0\u521b\u9020\u4e86\u6709\u5229\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0e\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u79d1\u5b66\u63a2\u7d22\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

In the viscous fingering\ninstability, a less viscous fluid displaces a more viscous one through the\nformation of fingers. The instability, which requires a confined geometry, is\noften studied in the thin gap of a quasi-two-dimensional Hele-Shaw cell. When\nthe two fluids are miscible, the structures that form in the dimension\ntraversing the gap are important for determining the instability onset. We\ndemonstrate with experiments and simulations that oscillatory translational\nshear of the confining plates changes the gap-averaged viscosity profile so\nthat it becomes less abrupt at the finger tips. Increasing the amplitude or\nvelocity of the shear delays the instability onset and decreases the finger\ngrowth rate.

Our observations on pretokenization strategies significantly improve\nmodel performance, and our data composition algorithm reduces the average\ntoken-to-word ratio by approximately 6% with respect to the conventional data\nrandomization approach. Our tokenizer achieves more than 40% improvement on\naverage token-to-word ratio against stateof-the-art multilingual Indic models.\nThis improvement yields measurable gains in both model performance and\ninference speed.

By leveraging two distinct hypergraph construction\nmethods-based on node degree and neighborhood levels, it strengthens the\nconnections among nodes with similar roles, enhancing the model's\nrepresentational power. Additionally, the inclusion of hypergraph convolution\nlayers enables the model to capture complex dependencies within hypergraph\nstructures.

Unlike classical\npolynomial interpolation, which is based on pointwise function evaluations,\nhistopolation reconstructs a function using integral data. However, similar to\nclassical polynomial interpolation, histopolation suffers from the well-known\nRunge phenomenon when integral data are based on a grid with many equispaced\nnodes, as well as the Gibbs phenomenon when approximating discontinuous\nfunctions. In contrast, quasi-histopolation is designed to relax the strict\nrequirement of passing through all the given data points.

Current approaches mainly rely on ID-based features and\nregion-specific data to learn correlations between cell towers and roads,\nlimiting their adaptability to unexplored areas. To enable high-accuracy CTMM\nwithout additional training in target regions, Zero-shot CTMM requires to\nextract not only region-adaptive features, but also sequential and location\nuncertainty to alleviate positioning errors in cellular data. In this paper, we\npropose a pixel-based trajectory calibration assistant for zero-shot CTMM,\nwhich takes advantage of transferable geospatial knowledge to calibrate\npixelated trajectory, and then guide the path-finding process at the road\nnetwork level. To enhance knowledge sharing across similar regions, a Gaussian\nmixture model is incorporated into VAE, enabling the identification of\nscenario-adaptive experts through soft clustering. To mitigate high positioning\nerrors, a spatial-temporal awareness module is designed to capture sequential\nfeatures and location uncertainty, thereby facilitating the inference of\napproximate user positions. Finally, a constrained path-finding algorithm is\nemployed to reconstruct the road ID sequence, ensuring topological validity\nwithin the road network. This process is guided by the calibrated trajectory\nwhile optimizing for the shortest feasible path, thus minimizing unnecessary\ndetours.

Here, we investigate the effect\nof evaporation on the measured surface tension using experiments and numerical\nsimulations. In the experiments, we measured the evolution of the droplet\ntemperature, which can drastically reduce by ($\\Delta T \\approx 10 \\degC$) due\nto evaporative cooling, and thereby altering the measured surface tension by\nmore than 1 mN/m. This finding can be reproduced by numerical simulations,\nwhich additionally allows for controlled investigations of the individual\ninfluences of further effects on the pendant drop method, namely shape\ndeformations by evaporation-driven flows in the gas-phase and in the\nliquid-phase including the resulting Marangoni flow. We provide a simple\npassive method to control the relative humidity without requiring additional\ninstrumentation. Our findings are particularly pertinent to Marangoni flows\nwhich are driven by surface tension gradients, and which are consequently\nhighly sensitive to measurement inaccuracies.

We validate our approach\nthrough real-world implementation: LLM-generated procedures, materials designs,\nand mechanical predictions were tested in the laboratory, culminating in the\nfabrication of a novel pollen-based adhesive with tunable morphology and\nmeasured shear strength, establishing a foundation for future plant-derived\nadhesive design. This work demonstrates how AI-assisted ideation can drive\nreal-world materials design and enable effective human-AI collaboration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u4e0e\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u6587\u732e\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u578b\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u79d1\u5b66\uff08\u5982\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408BioinspiredLLM\u3001RAG\u3001\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u7ed3\u6784-\u6027\u80fd\u5173\u7cfb\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u82b1\u7c89\u57fa\u7c98\u5408\u5242\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86AI\u8f85\u52a9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u8f85\u52a9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u591f\u63a8\u52a8\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u6750\u6599\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose RMT-PPAD, a\nreal-time, transformer-based multi-task model that jointly performs object\ndetection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line segmentation. We introduce\na lightweight module, a gate control with an adapter to adaptively fuse shared\nand task-specific features, effectively alleviating negative transfer between\ntasks. Additionally, we design an adaptive segmentation decoder to learn the\nweights over multi-scale features automatically during the training stage. This\navoids the manual design of task-specific structures for different segmentation\ntasks. We also identify and resolve the inconsistency between training and\ntesting labels in lane line segmentation. This allows fairer evaluation.\nExperiments on the BDD100K dataset demonstrate that RMT-PPAD achieves\nstate-of-the-art results with mAP50 of 84.9% and Recall of 95.4% for object\ndetection, mIoU of 92.6% for drivable area segmentation, and IoU of 56.8% and\naccuracy of 84.7% for lane line segmentation. The inference speed reaches 32.6\nFPS. Moreover, we introduce real-world scenarios to evaluate RMT-PPAD\nperformance in practice.

The most commonly used Polling-based Object Probing\nEvaluation (POPE) benchmark evaluates this issue by sampling negative\ncategories according to category-level statistics, \\textit{e.g.}, category\nfrequencies and co-occurrence. However, with the continuous advancement of\nLVLMs, the POPE benchmark has shown diminishing effectiveness in assessing\nobject hallucination, as it employs a simplistic sampling strategy that\noverlooks image-specific information and restricts distractors to negative\nobject categories only. In this paper, we introduce the Hallucination\nsearching-based Object Probing Evaluation (HOPE) benchmark, aiming to generate\nthe most misleading distractors (\\textit{i.e.}, non-existent objects or\nincorrect image descriptions) that can trigger hallucination in LVLMs, which\nserves as a means to more rigorously assess their immunity to hallucination.

The mechanical response of the material is modeled by a\nnonlinear constitutive relationship that algebraically relates stress to\nlinearized strain. This approach serves to mitigate non-physical strain\nsingularities and ensures that the crack-tip strains don't grow, unlike\nsingular stresses. A significant advancement is thus achieved in the\nformulation of boundary value problems (BVPs) for such complex scenarios. The\ngoverning equilibrium equation, derived from the balance of linear momentum and\nthe nonlinear constitutive model, is formulated as a second-order,\nvector-valued, quasilinear elliptic BVP. A classical traction-free boundary\ncondition is imposed on the crack face. The problem is solved using a robust\nnumerical scheme in which a Picard-type linearization is combined with a\ncontinuous Galerkin finite element method for the discretization. Analyses are\nperformed for both an isotropic and a transversely isotropic elastic solid\ncontaining a crack subjected to compressive loads. The primary crack-tip\nvariables**-stress, strain, and strain energy density-**are examined in detail.\nIt is demonstrated that while high concentrations of compressive stress and\nstrain energy density are observed at the crack tip, the growth of strain is\nsubstantially lower than that of stress. These findings are shown to be\nconsistent with the predictions of linear elastic fracture mechanics, but a\nmore physically meaningful representation of the crack-tip field is provided by\nthe nonlinear approach.

The state-of-the-art for\nperforming these fluid simulations relies on an Eulerian viewpoint, in which\nthe fluid domain is discretized into a mesh, and the governing equations\ndescribe the fluid motion as it passes through each cell of the mesh.

Our method reliably isolates and\nquantifies self-bias, even when models vary in ability, ensuring that genuine\nperformance differences are not mistaken for self-bias. We conduct an empirical\nanalysis of self-bias on a large dataset (>5000 prompt-completion pairs)\nconsisting of expert human annotations and judgments from nine different LLM\njudges. We find that some models, such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet,\nsystematically assign higher scores to their own outputs.

Effective\nand efficient analysis of their oral history archives can promote access and\nunderstanding of the oral histories. However, Large-scale analysis of these\narchives remains limited due to their unstructured format, emotional\ncomplexity, and high annotation costs. This paper presents a scalable framework\nto automate semantic and sentiment annotation for Japanese American\nIncarceration Oral History. Using LLMs, we construct a high-quality dataset,\nevaluate multiple models, and test prompt engineering strategies in\nhistorically sensitive contexts. Our multiphase approach combines expert\nannotation, prompt design, and LLM evaluation with ChatGPT, Llama, and Qwen. We\nlabeled 558 sentences from 15 narrators for sentiment and semantic\nclassification, then evaluated zero-shot, few-shot, and RAG strategies. For\nsemantic classification, ChatGPT achieved the highest F1 score (88.71%),\nfollowed by Llama (84.99%) and Qwen (83.72%). For sentiment analysis, Llama\nslightly outperformed Qwen (82.66%) and ChatGPT (82.29%), with all models\nshowing comparable results. The best prompt configurations were used to\nannotate 92,191 sentences from 1,002 interviews in the JAIOH collection. Our\nfindings show that LLMs can effectively perform semantic and sentiment\nannotation across large oral history collections when guided by well-designed\nprompts. This study provides a reusable annotation pipeline and practical\nguidance for applying LLMs in culturally sensitive archival analysis.

However, these models face inherent limitations in handling\nmulti-modal reasoning, semantic abstraction, and interactive decision-making.\nWhile recent advances have introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) into remote\nsensing workflows, existing studies primarily focus on downstream applications,\nlacking a unified theoretical framework that explains the cognitive role of\nlanguage. This review advocates a paradigm shift from vision-centered to\nlanguage-centered remote sensing interpretation. Drawing inspiration from the\nGlobal Workspace Theory (GWT) of human cognition, We propose a\nlanguage-centered framework for remote sensing interpretation that treats LLMs\nas the cognitive central hub integrating perceptual, task, knowledge and action\nspaces to enable unified understanding, reasoning, and decision-making. We\nfirst explore the potential of LLMs as the central cognitive component in\nremote sensing interpretation, and then summarize core technical challenges,\nincluding unified multimodal representation, knowledge association, and\nreasoning and decision-making. Furthermore, we construct a global\nworkspace-driven interpretation mechanism and review how language-centered\nsolutions address each challenge. Finally, we outline future research\ndirections from four perspectives: adaptive alignment of multimodal data, task\nunderstanding under dynamic knowledge constraints, trustworthy reasoning, and\nautonomous interaction.

The challenge that encoding addresses is the need for\nmechanisms that uniquely retain contextual information about the succession of\nindividual symbols, which can then be modeled by nonlinear formulations such as\nneural networks.\n  Context: Universal Sequence Maps(USM) are iterated functions that bijectively\nencode symbolic sequences onto embedded numerical spaces. USM is composed of\ntwo Chaos Game Representations (CGR), iterated forwardly and backwardly, that\ncan be projected into the frequency domain (FCGR).

However, while these systems are effective at improving\ntext, they are not optimally designed for language learning. They favor direct\nrevisions, often with a click-to-fix functionality that can be applied without\nconsidering the reason for the correction. Meanwhile, depending on the error\ntype, learners may benefit most from simple explanations and strategically\nindirect hints, especially on generalizable grammatical rules. To support the\ngeneration of such feedback, we introduce an annotation framework that models\neach error's error type and generalizability. For error type classification, we\nintroduce a typology focused on inferring learners' knowledge gaps by\nconnecting their errors to specific grammatical patterns.

To boost agents' in-context RL (ICRL) ability, this work\nformulates ICRL as a two-agent emergent communication problem and introduces\nCORAL (Communicative Representation for Adaptive RL), a framework that learns a\ntransferable communicative context by decoupling latent representation learning\nfrom control. In CORAL, an Information Agent (IA) is pre-trained as a world\nmodel on a diverse distribution of tasks. Its objective is not to maximize task\nreward, but to build a world model and distill its understanding into concise\nmessages. The emergent communication protocol is shaped by a novel Causal\nInfluence Loss, which measures the effect that the message has on the next\naction. During deployment, the previously trained IA serves as a fixed\ncontextualizer for a new Control Agent (CA), which learns to solve tasks by\ninterpreting the provided communicative context.

However, label errors, defined as missing labels,\nincorrect classification or inaccurate localization, often compromise the\nquality of these datasets. This can have a significant impact on the outcomes\nof training and benchmark evaluations. Although several methods now exist for\ndetecting label errors in object detection datasets, they are typically\nvalidated only on synthetic benchmarks or limited manual inspection. How to\ncorrect such errors systemically and at scale therefore remains an open\nproblem. We introduce a semi-automated framework for label-error correction\ncalled REC$\\checkmark$D (Rechecked). Building on existing detectors, the\nframework pairs their error proposals with lightweight, crowd-sourced\nmicrotasks. These tasks enable multiple annotators to independently verify each\ncandidate bounding box, and their responses are aggregated to estimate\nambiguity and improve label quality. To demonstrate the effectiveness of\nREC$\\checkmark$D, we apply it to the class pedestrian in the KITTI dataset. Our\ncrowdsourced review yields high-quality corrected annotations, which indicate a\nrate of at least 24% of missing and inaccurate annotations in original\nannotations. This validated set will be released as a new real-world benchmark\nfor label error detection and correction. We show that current label error\ndetection methods, when combined with our correction framework, can recover\nhundreds of errors in the time it would take a human to annotate bounding boxes\nfrom scratch.

Although recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved\nNER performance, they rely heavily on large, high-quality annotated datasets.\nHowever, building these datasets is expensive and time-consuming, posing a\nmajor bottleneck for further research. Current dataset merging approaches\nmainly focus on strategies like manual label mapping or constructing label\ngraphs, which lack interpretability and scalability. To address this, we\npropose an automatic label alignment method based on label similarity.

The key innovation is\nto train a dialogue model to correlate augmented responses with a quality score\nduring training and then leverage this knowledge at inference. We use\nnoun-based substitution for augmentation and semantic similarity-based scores\nas a proxy for response quality.

Typically, SDMs relate species occurrences to\nenvironmental variables representing abiotic factors, such as temperature,\nprecipitation, and soil properties. However, species distributions are also\nstrongly influenced by biotic interactions with other species, which are often\noverlooked. While some methods partially address this limitation by\nincorporating biotic interactions, they often assume symmetrical pairwise\nrelationships between species and require consistent co-occurrence data. In\npractice, species observations are sparse, and the availability of information\nabout the presence or absence of other species varies significantly across\nlocations. To address these challenges, we propose CISO, a deep learning-based\nmethod for species distribution modeling Conditioned on Incomplete Species\nObservations. CISO enables predictions to be conditioned on a flexible number\nof species observations alongside environmental variables, accommodating the\nvariability and incompleteness of available biotic data. We demonstrate our\napproach using three datasets representing different species groups: sPlotOpen\nfor plants, SatBird for birds, and a new dataset, SatButterfly, for\nbutterflies. Our results show that including partial biotic information\nimproves predictive performance on spatially separate test sets. When\nconditioned on a subset of species within the same dataset, CISO outperforms\nalternative methods in predicting the distribution of the remaining species.\nFurthermore, we show that combining observations from multiple datasets can\nimprove performance.

We introduce DatasetResearch, the first comprehensive benchmark\nevaluating AI agents' ability to discover and synthesize datasets from 208\nreal-world demands across knowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive tasks.\nOur tri-dimensional evaluation framework reveals a stark reality: even advanced\ndeep research systems achieve only 22% score on our challenging\nDatasetResearch-pro subset, exposing the vast gap between current capabilities\nand perfect dataset discovery. Our analysis uncovers a fundamental\ndichotomy-search agents excel at knowledge tasks through retrieval breadth,\nwhile synthesis agents dominate reasoning challenges via structured\ngeneration-yet both catastrophically fail on \"corner cases\" outside existing\ndistributions. These findings establish the first rigorous baseline for dataset\ndiscovery agents and illuminate the path toward AI systems capable of finding\nany dataset in the digital universe.

Unlike GAN-based methods, our approach integrates\ndiffusion models to learn the image translation process, allowing for more\ncoverable modeling of the data distribution and performance improvement of the\ncross-domain translation. However, incorporating the translation process within\nthe diffusion process is still challenging since the two processes are not\naligned exactly, i.e., the diffusion process is applied to the noisy signal\nwhile the translation process is conducted on the clean signal. As a result,\nrecent diffusion-based studies employ separate training or shallow integration\nto learn the two processes, yet this may cause the local minimal of the\ntranslation optimization, constraining the effectiveness of diffusion models.\nTo address the problem, we propose a novel joint learning framework that aligns\nthe diffusion and the translation process, thereby improving the global\noptimality.

With the reduced-sized micro-expression (ME) input that contains key\ninformation based on key-frame indexes, key-frame-based methods have\nsignificantly improved the performance of MER. However, most of these methods\nfocus on improving the performance with relatively accurate key-frame indexes,\nwhile ignoring the difficulty of obtaining accurate key-frame indexes and the\nobjective existence of key-frame index errors, which impedes them from moving\ntowards practical applications. In this paper, we propose CausalNet, a novel\nframework to achieve robust MER facing key-frame index errors while maintaining\naccurate recognition. To enhance robustness, CausalNet takes the representation\nof the entire ME sequence as the input. To address the information redundancy\nbrought by the complete ME range input and maintain accurate recognition,\nfirst, the Causal Motion Position Learning Module (CMPLM) is proposed to help\nthe model locate the muscle movement areas related to Action Units (AUs),\nthereby reducing the attention to other redundant areas. Second, the Causal\nAttention Block (CAB) is proposed to deeply learn the causal relationships\nbetween the muscle contraction and relaxation movements in MEs.

Firstly, we investigate a\ntraining-free approach that relies on a cluster lookup table, and secondly, we\nfinetune VAE encoders to predict token clusters directly from perturbed images.\nOverall, our experiments show that cluster-level watermarks improve robustness\nagainst perturbations and regeneration attacks while preserving image quality.\nCluster classification further boosts watermark detectability, outperforming a\nset of baselines.

In this work, we extend\nsingle-axis fairness evaluations to examine intersectional bias, recognizing\nthat when multiple axes of discrimination intersect, they create distinct\npatterns of disadvantage. We create a new benchmark called WinoIdentity by\naugmenting the WinoBias dataset with 25 demographic markers across 10\nattributes, including age, nationality, and race, intersected with binary\ngender, yielding 245,700 prompts to evaluate 50 distinct bias patterns.\nFocusing on harms of omission due to underrepresentation, we investigate bias\nthrough the lens of uncertainty and propose a group (un)fairness metric called\nCoreference Confidence Disparity which measures whether models are more or less\nconfident for some intersectional identities than others. We evaluate five\nrecently published LLMs and find confidence disparities as high as 40% along\nvarious demographic attributes including body type, sexual orientation and\nsocio-economic status, with models being most uncertain about\ndoubly-disadvantaged identities in anti-stereotypical settings.

Large Language Models (LLMs)\nhave demonstrated remarkable capabilities, surpassing earlier models in\ncomplexity and performance. Their evaluation across diverse tasks has\nconsistently showcased their potential, enabling the development of adaptive\nand personalized agents. However, despite these advancements, LLMs remain prone\nto errors, particularly in areas requiring nuanced moral reasoning. They\nstruggle with detecting implicit hate, offensive language, and gender biases\ndue to the subjective and context-dependent nature of these issues. Moreover,\ntheir reliance on training data can inadvertently reinforce societal biases,\nleading to inconsistencies and ethical concerns in their outputs. To explore\nthe limitations of LLMs in this role, we developed an experimental framework\nbased on state-of-the-art (SOTA) models to assess human emotions and offensive\nbehaviors. The framework introduces a unified benchmark dataset encompassing 49\ndistinct categories spanning the wide spectrum of human emotions, offensive and\nhateful text, and gender and racial biases. Furthermore, we introduced SafePhi,\na QLoRA fine-tuned version of Phi-4, adapting diverse ethical contexts and\noutperforming benchmark moderators by achieving a Macro F1 score of 0.89, where\nOpenAI Moderator and Llama Guard score 0.77 and 0.74, respectively.

While these models\nprovide rich semantic priors for appearance, they struggle to capture the\nphysical realism and motion dynamics needed for authentic 4D scene synthesis.\nIn contrast, real-world videos can provide physically grounded geometry and\narticulation cues that are difficult to hallucinate. One question is raised:\n\\textit{Can we generate physically consistent 4D content by leveraging the\nmotion priors of the real-world video}? In this work, we explore the task of\nreanimating deformable 3D scenes from a single video, using the original\nsequence as a supervisory signal to correct artifacts from synthetic motion. We\nintroduce \\textbf{Restage4D}, a geometry-preserving pipeline for\nvideo-conditioned 4D restaging.

We further incorporate an occlusion-aware\nrigidity loss and a disocclusion backtracing mechanism to improve structural\nand geometry consistency under challenging motion.

Traditional methods rely on invasive\ntissue sampling, which may fail to capture a tumor's spatial heterogeneity.\nWhile deep learning models have shown promise in molecular profiling, their\nperformance is often limited by scarce annotated data. In contrast, foundation\ndeep learning models offer a more generalizable approach for glioma imaging\nbiomarkers. We propose a Foundation-based Biomarker Network (FoundBioNet) that\nutilizes a SWIN-UNETR-based architecture to noninvasively predict IDH mutation\nstatus from multi-parametric MRI. Two key modules are incorporated: Tumor-Aware\nFeature Encoding (TAFE) for extracting multi-scale, tumor-focused features, and\nCross-Modality Differential (CMD) for highlighting subtle T2-FLAIR mismatch\nsignals associated with IDH mutation. The model was trained and validated on a\ndiverse, multi-center cohort of 1705 glioma patients from six public datasets.\nOur model achieved AUCs of 90.58%, 88.08%, 65.41%, and 80.31% on independent\ntest sets from EGD, TCGA, Ivy GAP, RHUH, and UPenn, consistently outperforming\nbaseline approaches (p <= 0.05).

However, these methods often struggle in challenging scenarios\ninvolving complex human poses or significant occlusions. Although some studies\naddress 3D human pose estimation under occlusion, they typically evaluate\nperformance on datasets that lack realistic or substantial occlusions, e.g.,\nmost existing datasets introduce occlusions with random patches over the human\nor clipart-style overlays, which may not reflect real-world challenges. To\nbridge this gap in realistic occlusion datasets, we introduce a novel benchmark\ndataset, VOccl3D, a Video-based human Occlusion dataset with 3D body pose and\nshape annotations. Inspired by works such as AGORA and BEDLAM, we constructed\nthis dataset using advanced computer graphics rendering techniques,\nincorporating diverse real-world occlusion scenarios, clothing textures, and\nhuman motions. Additionally, we fine-tuned recent HPS methods, CLIFF and\nBEDLAM-CLIFF, on our dataset, demonstrating significant qualitative and\nquantitative improvements across multiple public datasets, as well as on the\ntest split of our dataset, while comparing its performance with other\nstate-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we leveraged our dataset to enhance\nhuman detection performance under occlusion by fine-tuning an existing object\ndetector, YOLO11, thus leading to a robust end-to-end HPS estimation system\nunder occlusions. Overall, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for\nfuture research aimed at benchmarking methods designed to handle occlusions,\noffering a more realistic alternative to existing occlusion datasets.

It approximates the update of a\npretrained weight matrix $W\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$ by the product of two\nlow-rank matrices, $BA$, where $A \\in\\mathbb{R}^{r\\times n}$ and\n$B\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times r} (r\\ll\\min\\{m,n\\})$. Increasing the dimension $r$\ncan raise the rank of LoRA weights (i.e., $BA$), which typically improves\nfine-tuning performance but also significantly increases the number of\ntrainable parameters. In this paper, we propose Block Diversified Low-Rank\nAdaptation (BoRA), which improves the rank of LoRA weights with a small number\nof additional parameters. Specifically, BoRA treats the product $BA$ as a block\nmatrix multiplication, where $A$ and $B$ are partitioned into $b$ blocks along\nthe columns and rows, respectively (i.e., $A=[A_1,\\dots,A_b]$ and\n$B=[B_1,\\dots,B_b]^\\top$). Consequently, the product $BA$ becomes the\nconcatenation of the block products $B_iA_j$ for $i,j\\in[b]$. To enhance the\ndiversity of different block products, BoRA introduces a unique diagonal matrix\n$\\Sigma_{i,j} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{r\\times r}$ for each block multiplication,\nresulting in $B_i \\Sigma_{i,j} A_j$. By leveraging these block-wise diagonal\nmatrices, BoRA increases the rank of LoRA weights by a factor of $b$ while only\nrequiring $b^2r$ additional parameters.

In this paper we introduce Our method, a novel ResNet\ninspired dual resolution architecture specifically designed for melanocytic\ntumor segmentation. Our method maintains a full resolution stream that\npreserves fine grained boundary information while a complementary pooled stream\naggregates multi scale contextual cues for robust lesion recognition. The\nstreams are tightly coupled by boundary aware residual connections that inject\nhigh frequency edge information into deep feature maps, and by a channel\nattention module that adapts color and texture sensitivity to dermoscopic\nappearance. To further address common imaging artifacts and the limited size of\nclinical datasets, we propose a lightweight artifact suppression block and a\nmulti task training objective that combines a Dice Tversky segmentation loss\nwith an explicit boundary loss and a contrastive regularizer for feature\nstability. The combined design yields pixel accurate masks without requiring\nheavy post processing or complex pre training protocols.

Within this framework, a server extracts and transmits the\nsemantic information, i.e., the meaning of image data, to a user over several\ntime slots. An attacker seeks to detect and eavesdrop the semantic transmission\nto acquire details of the original image. To avoid data meaning being\neavesdropped by an attacker, a friendly jammer is deployed to transmit jamming\nsignals to interfere the attacker so as to hide the transmitted semantic\ninformation. Meanwhile, the server will strategically select time slots for\nsemantic information transmission. Due to limited energy, the jammer will not\ncommunicate with the server and hence the server does not know the transmit\npower of the jammer. Therefore, the server must jointly optimize the semantic\ninformation transmitted at each time slot and the corresponding transmit power\nto maximize the privacy and the semantic information transmission quality of\nthe user. To solve this problem, we propose a prioritised sampling assisted\ntwin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to jointly determine\nthe transmitted semantic information and the transmit power per time slot\nwithout the communications between the server and the jammer. Compared to\nstandard reinforcement learning methods, the propose method uses an additional\nQ network to estimate Q values such that the agent can select the action with a\nlower Q value from the two Q networks thus avoiding local optimal action\nselection and estimation bias of Q values.

However, modeling this progression\nremains challenging due to 1) the scarcity of longitudinal data obtained\nthrough irregular and infrequent subject visits and 2) the complex interplay of\npathological mechanisms across brain regions and disease stages, where\ntraditional models assume fixed mechanisms throughout disease progression. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel stage-aware Mixture of Experts\n(MoE) framework that explicitly models how different contributing mechanisms\ndominate at different disease stages through time-dependent expert\nweighting.Data-wise, we utilize an iterative dual optimization method to\nproperly estimate the temporal position of individual observations,\nconstructing a co hort-level progression trajectory from irregular snapshots.\nModel-wise, we enhance the spatial component with an inhomogeneous graph neural\ndiffusion model (IGND) that allows diffusivity to vary based on node states and\ntime, providing more flexible representations of brain networks. We also\nintroduce a localized neural reaction module to capture complex dynamics beyond\nstandard processes.The resulting IGND-MoE model dynamically integrates these\ncomponents across temporal states, offering a principled way to understand how\nstage-specific pathological mechanisms contribute to progression.

While RL\ndrives this self-improvement paradigm, a recent study (Gandhi et al., 2025)\nshows that RL alone does not truly instill these new reasoning abilities - it\nmerely draws out behaviors already present in the base models. This raises a\nquestion: How can we train the models that don't exhibit such thinking behavior\nto develop it in the first place? To this end, we propose ThinkTuning, a\nGRPO-based interactive training approach where we augment the rollouts of a\nstudent model with the guidance from a teacher model. A simple idea from\nclassroom practice inspires our method: a teacher poses a problem, lets the\nstudent try an answer, then gives corrective feedback -- enough to point the\nmind in the right direction and then show the solution. Each piece of feedback\nreshapes the student's thoughts, leading them to arrive at the correct\nsolution. Similarly, we find that this type of implicit supervision through\nfeedback from a teacher model of the same size improves the reasoning\ncapabilities of the student model. In particular, on average, our method shows\na 3.85% improvement over zero-shot baselines across benchmarks, and on\nMATH-500, AIME and GPQA-Diamond it shows 2.08%, 2.23% and 3.99% improvements\nover the vanilla-GRPO baseline.

Unlike existing learning-based methods that perform offline\nfine-tuning using batch pointwise matching over entire trajectories, OTAKNet\nestablishes a connection between the state estimate and the drift via one-step\npredictive measurement likelihood, and addresses it using optimal transport.\nThis leverages OT's geometry - aware cost and stable gradients to enable fully\nonline adaptation without ground truth labels or retraining.

To address this, we conducted a\ncomprehensive analysis using relative rather than absolute input lengths,\ndefined with respect to each model's context window. Our findings reveal that\nthe LiM effect is strongest when inputs occupy up to 50% of a model's context\nwindow. Beyond that, the primacy bias weakens, while recency bias remains\nrelatively stable. This effectively eliminates the LiM effect; instead, we\nobserve a distance-based bias, where model performance is better when relevant\ninformation is closer to the end of the input. Furthermore, our results suggest\nthat successful retrieval is a prerequisite for reasoning in LLMs, and that the\nobserved positional biases in reasoning are largely inherited from retrieval.\nThese insights have implications for long-context tasks, the design of future\nLLM benchmarks, and evaluation methodologies for LLMs handling extended inputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u957f\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5982\u201c\u4e2d\u95f4\u8ff7\u5931\u201d\uff08LiM\uff09\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4e14LiM\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u5360\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e350%\u65f6\u6700\u5f3a\u3002\u8d85\u8fc750%\u65f6\uff0c\u9996\u56e0\u6548\u5e94\u51cf\u5f31\uff0c\u800c\u8fd1\u56e0\u6548\u5e94\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u8ddd\u79bb\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u662fLLMs\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u524d\u63d0\uff0c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22LLMs\u5728\u957f\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\uff08\u5982LiM\u6548\u5e94\uff09\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u8868\u73b0\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u957f\u5ea6\uff08\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "LiM\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u536050%\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u65f6\u6700\u5f3a\uff1b\u8d85\u8fc750%\u65f6\uff0c\u9996\u56e0\u6548\u5e94\u51cf\u5f31\uff0c\u8fd1\u56e0\u6548\u5e94\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u8ddd\u79bb\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u68c0\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u524d\u63d0\uff0c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\u6e90\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001LLM\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

This\nis the well-known problem of alignment, which refers to the challenge of\ndesigning AI systems that align with human values, goals and preferences. This\nproblem is particularly challenging since most human ethical considerations\nrefer to \\emph{incommensurable} (i.e. non-measurable and/or incomparable)\nvalues and criteria. Consider, for instance, a medical agent prescribing a\ntreatment to a cancerous patient. How could it take into account (and/or weigh)\nincommensurable aspects like the value of a human life and the cost of the\ntreatment? Now, the alignment between human and artificial values is possible\nonly if we define a common space where a metric can be defined and used. This\npaper proposes to extend to ethics the conventional Anything2vec approach,\nwhich has been successful in plenty of similar and hard-to-quantify domains\n(ranging from natural language processing to recommendation systems and graph\nanalysis). This paper proposes a way to map an automatic agent decision-making\n(or control law) strategy to a multivariate vector representation, which can be\nused to compare and assess the alignment with human values. The Ethics2Vec\nmethod is first introduced in the case of an automatic agent performing binary\ndecision-making. Then, a vectorisation of an automatic control law (like in the\ncase of a self-driving car) is discussed to show how the approach can be\nextended to automatic control settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faEthics2Vec\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5411\u91cf\u5316AI\u51b3\u7b56\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f26\u7406\u4ef7\u503c\u96be\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6d89\u53ca\u4e0d\u53ef\u516c\u5ea6\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u65f6\uff08\u5982\u751f\u547d\u4ef7\u503c\u4e0e\u6cbb\u7597\u6210\u672c\uff09\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4ef7\u503c\u91cf\u5316\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55Anything2vec\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06AI\u51b3\u7b56\u7b56\u7565\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u4ee5\u4e8c\u5143\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u63a7\u5236\u4e3a\u4f8b\u8bf4\u660e\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51faEthics2Vec\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u4f26\u7406\u4ef7\u503c\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u5728\u4e8c\u5143\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Ethics2Vec\u4e3aAI\u4f26\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Quality Estimation (QE) for Machine\nTranslation (MT), which assesses the quality of a source-target pair without\nrelying on reference translations, remains a challenging cross-lingual task for\nLLMs. The challenges stem from the inherent limitations of existing LLM-based\nQE systems, which are pre-trained for causal language modelling rather than\nregression-specific tasks, further elevated by the presence of low-resource\nlanguages given pre-training data distribution. This paper introduces ALOPE, an\nadaptive layer-optimization framework designed to enhance LLM-based QE by\nrestructuring Transformer representations through layer-wise adaptation for\nimproved regression-based prediction. Our framework integrates low-rank\nadapters (LoRA) with regression task heads, leveraging selected pre-trained\nTransformer layers for improved cross-lingual alignment. In addition to the\nlayer-specific adaptation, ALOPE introduces two strategies-dynamic weighting,\nwhich adaptively combines representations from multiple layers, and multi-head\nregression, which aggregates regression losses from multiple heads for QE. Our\nframework shows improvements over various existing LLM-based QE approaches.\nEmpirical evidence suggests that intermediate Transformer layers in LLMs\nprovide contextual representations that are more aligned with the cross-lingual\nnature of the QE task.

We\nintroduce ThemeClouds, an open-source visualization tool that uses large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to generate thematic, participant-weighted word clouds\nfrom dialogue transcripts.

While\nprior methods rely on offline trajectory comparisons to elicit human\npreferences, such data is unavailable in online learning scenarios where agents\nmust adapt on the fly. Recent approaches address this by collecting real-time\nscalar feedback to guide agent behavior and train reward models for continued\nlearning after human feedback becomes unavailable. However, scalar feedback is\noften noisy and inconsistent, limiting the accuracy and generalization of\nlearned rewards. We propose Pref-GUIDE, a framework that transforms real-time\nscalar feedback into preference-based data to improve reward model learning for\ncontinual policy training. Pref-GUIDE Individual mitigates temporal\ninconsistency by comparing agent behaviors within short windows and filtering\nambiguous feedback.

This enables\nprecise, text-driven edits without compromising contextual integrity. (2)\nDual-Prompt Guidance, which combines local prompts for object-specific edits\nwith a global target prompt to maintain coherent scene interactions. On\nreal-world image editing tasks (addition, replacement, removal), CannyEdit\noutperforms prior methods like KV-Edit, achieving a 2.93 to 10.49 percent\nimprovement in the balance of text adherence and context fidelity.

We evaluate performance under varying fields of view\n(200 degree, 160 degree, and 120 degree) to study the tradeoff between\nperipheral distortion and spatial coverage. Fisheye-GS benefits from field of\nview (FoV) reduction, particularly at 160 degree, while 3DGUT remains stable\nacross all settings and maintains high perceptual quality at the full 200\ndegree view.

In this study, we investigate whether\nsocial bias contributes to these hallucinations, a causal relationship that has\nnot been explored. A key challenge is controlling confounders within the\ncontext, which complicates the isolation of causality between bias states and\nhallucinations. To address this, we utilize the Structural Causal Model (SCM)\nto establish and validate the causality and design bias interventions to\ncontrol confounders.

Prior work has shown that ICL emerges in transformers due to\nthe presence of special circuits called induction heads. Given the equivalence\nbetween induction heads and conditional k-grams, a recent line of work modeling\nsequential inputs as Markov processes has revealed the fundamental impact of\nmodel depth on its ICL capabilities: while a two-layer transformer can\nefficiently represent a conditional 1-gram model, its single-layer counterpart\ncannot solve the task unless it is exponentially large. However, for higher\norder Markov sources, the best known constructions require at least three\nlayers (each with a single attention head) - leaving open the question: can a\ntwo-layer single-head transformer represent any kth-order Markov process? In\nthis paper, we precisely address this and theoretically show that a two-layer\ntransformer with one head per layer can indeed represent any conditional\nk-gram. Thus, our result provides the tightest known characterization of the\ninterplay between transformer depth and Markov order for ICL. Building on this,\nwe further analyze the learning dynamics of our two-layer construction,\nfocusing on a simplified variant for first-order Markov chains, illustrating\nhow effective in-context representations emerge during training.

In this work,\nwe propose Neural Bridge Processes (NBPs), a novel method for modeling\nstochastic functions where inputs x act as dynamic anchors for the entire\ndiffusion trajectory. By reformulating the forward kernel to explicitly depend\non x, NBP enforces a constrained path that strictly terminates at the\nsupervised target. This approach not only provides stronger gradient signals\nbut also guarantees endpoint coherence. We validate NBPs on synthetic data, EEG\nsignal regression and image regression tasks, achieving substantial\nimprovements over baselines. These results underscore the effectiveness of\nDDPM-style bridge sampling in enhancing both performance and theoretical\nconsistency for structured prediction tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aNeural Bridge Processes (NBPs)\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5efa\u6a21\u968f\u673a\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u951a\u5b9a\u8f93\u5165x\u7684\u6269\u6563\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u6355\u6349\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08GPs\uff09\u5728\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5047\u8bbe\u9ad8\u65af\u6027\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff1b\u795e\u7ecf\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08NPs\uff09\u867d\u7075\u6d3b\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u795e\u7ecf\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08NDPs\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u589e\u5f3a\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u8026\u5408\u5f31\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNeural Bridge Processes (NBPs)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u524d\u5411\u6838\u663e\u5f0f\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8f93\u5165x\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u7ea6\u675f\u8def\u5f84\u4e25\u683c\u7ec8\u6b62\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e76\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7ec8\u70b9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u3001EEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86NBPs\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "NBPs\u901a\u8fc7DDPM\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u6865\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

This\ntime-consuming offline process not only makes it difficult to scale with\ntraining dataset size, but also leads to sub-optimal solutions due to its\ndiscontinuous optimization routine. To solve these, we first present a novel\npseudo-mask algorithm, Fast Universal Agglomerative Pooling (UniAP). Each layer\nof UniAP can identify groups of similar nodes in parallel, allowing to generate\nboth semantic-level and instance-level and multi-granular pseudo-masks within\nens of milliseconds for one image.

Extensive\nexperiments on a multi-centre dataset of 2131 patient 3D MRIs from randomized\nclinical trials for relapsing-remitting MS demonstrate that our generative\nmodel is able to accurately predict NET2 lesion masks for patients across six\ndifferent treatments. Moreover, we demonstrate our model has the potential for\nreal-world clinical applications through downstream tasks such as future lesion\ncount and location estimation, binary lesion activity classification, and\ngenerating counterfactual future NET2 masks for several treatments with\ndifferent efficacies.

A key challenge we address is\nmaintaining consistency across different maps in a lightweight manner, without\nrelying on training new VAEs or significantly altering the DiT backbone (which\nwould damage its prior capabilities). To tackle this, we introduce the\nCrossStitch module, a lightweight convolutional module that captures inter-map\ndependencies through localized operations.

To this end, we evaluate both\nindividual LLMs and multi-agent approaches across three highly specialized\ndomains: finance, biomedicine, and law. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent\ndiscussion framework to simulate a group of human annotators, where LLMs are\ntasked to engage in discussions by considering others' annotations and\njustifications before finalizing their labels. Additionally, we incorporate\nreasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) to enable a more comprehensive comparison.

(2) Overall, reasoning models do not demonstrate\nstatistically significant improvements over non-reasoning models in most\nsettings.

However, this task remains challenging due to low\ncontrast with surrounding mucosa, specular highlights, and indistinct\nboundaries. To address these challenges, we propose FOCUS-Med, which stands for\nFusion of spatial and structural graph with attentional context-aware polyp\nsegmentation in endoscopic medical imaging. FOCUS-Med integrates a Dual Graph\nConvolutional Network (Dual-GCN) module to capture contextual spatial and\ntopological structural dependencies. This graph-based representation enables\nthe model to better distinguish polyps from background tissues by leveraging\ntopological cues and spatial connectivity, which are often obscured in raw\nimage intensities. It enhances the model's ability to preserve boundaries and\ndelineate complex shapes typical of polyps. In addition, a location-fused\nstand-alone self-attention is employed to strengthen global context\nintegration.

The Mixture\nof Experts (MoE) architecture enhances model capacity through sparse\nactivation, but faces two major difficulties in practical deployment: (1) The\npresence of numerous outliers in activation distributions leads to severe\ndegradation in quantization accuracy for both activations and weights,\nsignificantly impairing inference performance; (2) Under limited memory,\nefficient offloading and collaborative inference of expert modules struggle to\nbalance latency and throughput. To address these issues, this paper proposes an\nefficient MoE edge deployment scheme based on Hessian-Aware Quantization (HAQ)\nand CPU-GPU collaborative inference. First, by introducing smoothed Hessian\nmatrix quantization, we achieve joint 8-bit quantization of activations and\nweights, which significantly alleviates the accuracy loss caused by outliers\nwhile ensuring efficient implementation on mainstream hardware. Second, we\ndesign an expert-level collaborative offloading and inference mechanism, which,\ncombined with expert activation path statistics, enables efficient deployment\nand scheduling of expert modules between CPU and GPU, greatly reducing memory\nfootprint and inference latency.

However, open-source agents still\nfall short of achieving expert-level Search Intelligence, the ability to\nresolve ambiguous queries, generate precise searches, analyze results, and\nconduct thorough exploration. Existing approaches fall short in scalability,\nefficiency, and data quality. For example, small turn limits in existing online\nRL methods, e.g. <=10, restrict complex strategy learning. This paper\nintroduces ASearcher, an open-source project for large-scale RL training of\nsearch agents. Our key contributions include: (1) Scalable fully asynchronous\nRL training that enables long-horizon search while maintaining high training\nefficiency. (2) A prompt-based LLM agent that autonomously synthesizes\nhigh-quality and challenging QAs, creating a large-scale QA dataset. Through RL\ntraining, our prompt-based QwQ-32B agent achieves substantial improvements,\nwith 46.7% and 20.8% Avg@4 gains on xBench and GAIA, respectively. Notably, our\nagent exhibits extreme long-horizon search, with tool calls exceeding 40 turns\nand output tokens exceeding 150k during training time. With a simple agent\ndesign and no external LLMs, ASearcher-Web-QwQ achieves Avg@4 scores of 42.1 on\nxBench and 52.8 on GAIA, surpassing existing open-source 32B agents.

Early and accurate\nprediction of lightning would enable preventive measures to safeguard people,\nprotect property, and minimize economic losses. In this paper, we present\nDeepLight, a novel deep learning architecture for predicting lightning\noccurrences. Existing prediction models face several critical limitations: they\noften struggle to capture the dynamic spatial context and inherent uncertainty\nof lightning events, underutilize key observational data, such as radar\nreflectivity and cloud properties, and rely heavily on Numerical Weather\nPrediction (NWP) systems, which are both computationally expensive and highly\nsensitive to parameter settings. To overcome these challenges, DeepLight\nleverages multi-source meteorological data, including radar reflectivity, cloud\nproperties, and historical lightning occurrences through a dual-encoder\narchitecture.

However, their\ndependence on large neural architectures and the restricted accessibility of\npretraining data significantly limits their practicality in real-world\napplications. To address this limitation, we propose Dynamic Pattern Alignment\nLearning (DPAL), a novel distillation-based pretraining framework that\nefficiently trains lightweight HVMs to acquire strong generalization from large\nHVMs. In particular, human-centric visual perception are highly dependent on\nthree typical visual patterns, including global identity pattern, local shape\npattern and multi-person interaction pattern. To achieve generalizable\nlightweight HVMs, we firstly design a dynamic pattern decoder (D-PaDe), acting\nas a dynamic Mixture of Expert (MoE) model. It incorporates three specialized\nexperts dedicated to adaptively extract typical visual patterns, conditioned on\nboth input image and pattern queries. And then, we present three levels of\nalignment objectives, which aims to minimize generalization gap between\nlightweight HVMs and large HVMs at global image level, local pixel level, and\ninstance relation level. With these two deliberate designs, the DPAL\neffectively guides lightweight model to learn all typical human visual patterns\nfrom large HVMs, which can generalize to various human-centric vision tasks.\nExtensive experiments conducted on 15 challenging datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the DPAL.

We also design novel optimization frameworks for our\nattacks and conduct extensive experiments, including black-box scenarios.\nNotably, our extensive experiments show that our attacks are more effective in\nmanipulating predictive uncertainties than traditional attacks that focus on\nlabel misclassifications, and existing defenses against conventional attacks\nare ineffective against our attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6076\u610f\u9057\u5fd8\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u64cd\u7eb5\u7279\u5b9a\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u653b\u51fb\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u63a2\u8ba8\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5728\u6076\u610f\u9057\u5fd8\u653b\u51fb\u4e2d\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9ed1\u76d2\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u653b\u51fb\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6807\u7b7e\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u65e0\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9996\u6b21\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5728\u6076\u610f\u9057\u5fd8\u653b\u51fb\u4e2d\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The\nanimation of sketches infuses life into these static drawings, opening a new\ndimension for designers. Animating sketches is a time-consuming process that\ndemands professional skills and extensive experience, often proving daunting\nfor amateurs. In this paper, we propose a novel sketch animation model\nSketchAnimator, which enables adding creative motion to a given sketch, like \"a\njumping car''. Namely, given an input sketch and a reference video, we divide\nthe sketch animation into three stages: Appearance Learning, Motion Learning\nand Video Prior Distillation. In stages 1 and 2, we utilize LoRA to integrate\nsketch appearance information and motion dynamics from the reference video into\nthe pre-trained T2V model.

This paper benchmarks the performance of different state-of-the-art\ndetectors in educational contexts, introducing a novel dataset, called\nGenerative Essay Detection in Education (GEDE), containing over 900\nstudent-written essays and over 12,500 LLM-generated essays from various\ndomains.

However, despite recent progress, studies\nshow that SLMs often struggle to generalize across datasets, even for trained\nlanguages and tasks, raising concerns about whether they process speech in a\ntext-like manner as intended. A key challenge underlying this limitation is the\nmodality gap between speech and text representations. The high variability in\nspeech embeddings may allow SLMs to achieve strong in-domain performance by\nexploiting unintended speech variations, ultimately hindering generalization.\nTo mitigate this modality gap, we introduce Optimal Transport Regularization\n(OTReg), a method that formulates speech-text alignment as an optimal transport\nproblem and derives a regularization loss to improve SLM training. In each\ntraining iteration, OTReg first establishes a structured correspondence between\nspeech and transcript embeddings by determining the optimal transport plan,\nthen incorporates the regularization loss based on this transport plan to\noptimize SLMs in generating speech embeddings that align more effectively with\ntranscript embeddings. OTReg is lightweight, requiring no additional labels or\nlearnable parameters, and integrates seamlessly into existing SLM training\nprocedures. Extensive multilingual ASR experiments demonstrate that OTReg\nenhances speech-text alignment, mitigates the modality gap, and consequently\nimproves SLM generalization across diverse datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aOTReg\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6765\u7f29\u5c0f\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u8868\u5f81\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u53e3\u8bed\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLM\uff09\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u53e3\u8bed\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLM\uff09\u5728\u8bed\u97f3\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u8868\u5f81\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86OTReg\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u635f\u5931\u4f18\u5316SLM\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6807\u7b7e\u6216\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00ASR\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cOTReg\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86SLM\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "OTReg\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709SLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Current RVOS methods view referring\nexpressions as unstructured sequences, neglecting their crucial semantic\nstructure essential for referent reasoning. Besides, in contrast to\nimage-referring expressions whose semantics focus only on object attributes and\nobject-object relations, video-referring expressions also encompass event\nattributes and event-event temporal relations. This complexity challenges\ntraditional structured reasoning image approaches. In this paper, we propose\nthe Event Referential Reasoning (EventRR) framework. EventRR decouples RVOS\ninto object summarization part and referent reasoning part. The summarization\nphase begins by summarizing each frame into a set of bottleneck tokens, which\nare then efficiently aggregated in the video-level summarization step to\nexchange the global cross-modal temporal context.

As sensor observations may change\ndynamically over time, fresh features are critical for inference tasks.\nHowever, timely delivering features from all modalities is often infeasible due\nto limited network resources. To this end, we study a two-modality scheduling\nproblem to minimize the ML model's inference error, which is expressed as a\npenalty function of AoI for both modalities. We develop an index-based\nthreshold policy and prove its optimality. Specifically, the scheduler switches\nmodalities when the current modality's index function exceeds a threshold.

This thesis investigates how\nuncertainty estimation can enhance the safety and trustworthiness of ML,\nfocusing on selective prediction -- where models abstain when confidence is\nlow.\n  We first show that a model's training trajectory contains rich uncertainty\nsignals that can be exploited without altering its architecture or loss. By\nensembling predictions from intermediate checkpoints, we propose a lightweight,\npost-hoc abstention method that works across tasks, avoids the cost of deep\nensembles, and achieves state-of-the-art selective prediction performance.\nCrucially, this approach is fully compatible with differential privacy (DP),\nallowing us to study how privacy noise affects uncertainty quality. We find\nthat while many methods degrade under DP, our trajectory-based approach remains\nrobust, and we introduce a framework for isolating the privacy-uncertainty\ntrade-off. Next, we then develop a finite-sample decomposition of the selective\nclassification gap -- the deviation from the oracle accuracy-coverage curve --\nidentifying five interpretable error sources and clarifying which interventions\ncan close the gap. This explains why calibration alone cannot fix ranking\nerrors, motivating methods that improve uncertainty ordering. Finally, we show\nthat uncertainty signals can be adversarially manipulated to hide errors or\ndeny service while maintaining high accuracy, and we design defenses combining\ncalibration audits with verifiable inference.\n  Together, these contributions advance reliable ML by improving, evaluating,\nand safeguarding uncertainty estimation, enabling models that not only make\naccurate predictions -- but also know when to say \"I do not know\".", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u4e8b\u540e\u5f03\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f4e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u65f6\u9009\u62e9\u5f03\u6743\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u4e8b\u540e\u5f03\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u6216\u635f\u5931\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u64cd\u7eb5\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u505a\u51fa\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u65f6\u9009\u62e9\u5f03\u6743\u3002"}}

In fact, the content semantics conveyed by real images often conform\nto human cognitive laws. However, image manipulation technology usually\ndestroys the internal relationship between content features, thus leaving\nsemantic clues for IML. In this paper, we propose a cognition-inspired\nmultimodal boundary-preserving network (CMB-Net). Specifically, CMB-Net\nutilizes large language models (LLMs) to analyze manipulated regions within\nimages and generate prompt-based textual information to compensate for the lack\nof semantic relationships in the visual information. Considering that the\nerroneous texts induced by hallucination from LLMs will damage the accuracy of\nIML, we propose an image-text central ambiguity module (ITCAM).

Although there are already many\nexcellent works related to inference models in the current community, there are\nstill many problems with reproducing high-performance inference models due to\nincomplete disclosure of training details. This report provides an in-depth\nanalysis of the reasoning model, covering the entire post-training workflow\nfrom data preparation and long Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning (long\nCoT SFT) to reinforcement learning (RL), along with detailed ablation studies\nfor each experimental component. For SFT data, our experiments show that a\nsmall number of high-quality data sources are more effective than a large\nnumber of diverse data sources, and that difficult samples can achieve better\nresults without accuracy filtering. In addition, we investigate two key issues\nwith current clipping mechanisms in RL: Clipping suppresses critical\nexploration signals and ignores suboptimal trajectories.

The\nfaithfulness issue undermines the reliability and practical utility of\nattribution explanations. We argue that these concerns stem from three core\nchallenges. First, difficulties arise in comparing attribution methods due to\ntheir unstructured heterogeneity, differences in heuristics, formulations, and\nimplementations that lack a unified organization. Second, most methods lack\nsolid theoretical underpinnings, with their rationales remaining absent,\nambiguous, or unverified. Third, empirically evaluating faithfulness is\nchallenging without ground truth. Recent theoretical advances provide a\npromising way to tackle these challenges, attracting increasing attention.

In this work, we propose a socially-aware privacy-preserving FL\nmechanism that systematically quantifies indirect privacy leakage through a\nmulti-hop propagation model. We formulate the server-client interaction as a\ntwo-stage Stackelberg game, where the server, as the leader, optimizes\nincentive policies, and clients, as followers, strategically select their\nprivacy budgets, which determine their privacy-preserving levels by controlling\nthe magnitude of added noise. To mitigate information asymmetry in networked\nprivacy estimation, we introduce a mean-field estimator to approximate the\naverage external privacy risk. We theoretically prove the existence and\nconvergence of the fixed point of the mean-field estimator and derive\nclosed-form expressions for the Stackelberg Nash Equilibrium. Despite being\ndesigned from a client-centric incentive perspective, our mechanism achieves\napproximately-optimal social welfare, as revealed by Price of Anarchy (PoA)\nanalysis.

Recent studies have leveraged the\ngeneralization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to adapt to time\nseries forecasting, achieving promising performance. However, existing studies\nfocus on token-level modal alignment, instead of bridging the intrinsic\nmodality gap between linguistic knowledge structures and time series data\npatterns, greatly limiting the semantic representation. To address this issue,\nwe propose a novel Semantic-Enhanced LLM (SE-LLM) that explores the inherent\nperiodicity and anomalous characteristics of time series to embed into the\nsemantic space to enhance the token embedding. This process enhances the\ninterpretability of tokens for LLMs, thereby activating the potential of LLMs\nfor temporal sequence analysis. Moreover, existing Transformer-based LLMs excel\nat capturing long-range dependencies but are weak at modeling short-term\nanomalies in time-series data.

To accurately generate descriptions related to\nthe image, a critical step in image captioning is to identify objects and\nunderstand their relations within the image. Modern approaches typically\ncapitalize on object detectors or combine detectors with Graph Convolutional\nNetwork (GCN). However, these models suffer from redundant detection\ninformation, difficulty in GCN construction, and high training costs. To\naddress these issues, a Retrieval-based Objects and Relations Prompt for Image\nCaptioning (RORPCap) is proposed, inspired by the fact that image-text\nretrieval can provide rich semantic information for input images. RORPCap\nemploys an Objects and relations Extraction Model to extract object and\nrelation words from the image. These words are then incorporate into predefined\nprompt templates and encoded as prompt embeddings. Next, a Mamba-based mapping\nnetwork is designed to quickly map image embeddings extracted by CLIP to\nvisual-text embeddings. Finally, the resulting prompt embeddings and\nvisual-text embeddings are concatenated to form textual-enriched feature\nembeddings, which are fed into a GPT-2 model for caption generation. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on the widely used MS-COCO dataset show that the RORPCap\nrequires only 2.6 hours under cross-entropy loss training, achieving 120.5%\nCIDEr score and 22.0% SPICE score on the \"Karpathy\" test split.

The RL paradigm requires the agent to\ninstantaneously perceive the state evolution to infer the effects of its\nactions on the environment. This is impossible if the agent receives state\nupdates over lossy or delayed wireless systems and thus operates with partial\nand intermittent information. In recent years, numerous frameworks have been\nproposed to manage RL with imperfect feedback; however, they often offer\nspecific solutions with a substantial computational burden. To address these\nlimits, we propose a novel architecture, named Homomorphic Robust Remote\nReinforcement Learning (HR3L), that enables the training of remote RL agents\nexchanging observations across a non-ideal wireless channel. HR3L considers two\nunits: the transmitter, which encodes meaningful representations of the\nenvironment, and the receiver, which decodes these messages and performs\nactions to maximize a reward signal. Importantly, HR3L does not require the\nexchange of gradient information across the wireless channel, allowing for\nquicker training and a lower communication overhead than state-of-the-art\nsolutions.

To address overfitting and\nlanguage drift, we further introduce regularization that preserves the\npre-trained distribution and anchors context tokens to improve subject fidelity\nand re-contextualization. Additionally, CoAR supports training-free subject\ncustomization in a user-provided style. Experiments demonstrate that CoAR\nachieves superior performance on both subject-driven personalization and style\npersonalization, while delivering significant gains in computational and memory\nefficiency. Notably, CoAR tunes less than \\textbf{0.05\\%} of the parameters\nwhile achieving competitive performance compared to recent Proxy-Tuning.

Although existing deep\nlearning-based restoration methods have made considerable progress, they often\nstruggle to recover complex texture details, resulting in over-smoothed\noutputs. To overcome these limitations, we propose SODiff, a novel and\nefficient semantic-oriented one-step diffusion model for JPEG artifacts\nremoval. Our core idea is that effective restoration hinges on providing\nsemantic-oriented guidance to the pre-trained diffusion model, thereby fully\nleveraging its powerful generative prior. To this end, SODiff incorporates a\nsemantic-aligned image prompt extractor (SAIPE). SAIPE extracts rich features\nfrom low-quality (LQ) images and projects them into an embedding space\nsemantically aligned with that of the text encoder. Simultaneously, it\npreserves crucial information for faithful reconstruction. Furthermore, we\npropose a quality factor-aware time predictor that implicitly learns the\ncompression quality factor (QF) of the LQ image and adaptively selects the\noptimal denoising start timestep for the diffusion process.

Comprehensive evaluations across complex human\nalignment tasks demonstrate GRAO's superior performance, achieving\n57.70\\%,17.65\\% 7.95\\% and 5.18\\% relative improvements over SFT, DPO, PPO and\nGRPO baselines respectively.

However, current alignment methods, primarily based on RLHF,\noptimize LLMs toward a single reward function, resulting in rigid behavior that\nfails to capture the complexity and diversity of human preferences. This\nlimitation hinders the adaptability of LLMs to practical scenarios, making\nmulti-objective alignment (MOA) a critical yet underexplored area. To bridge\nthis gap, we propose Pareto Multi-Objective Alignment (PAMA), a principled and\ncomputationally efficient algorithm designed explicitly for MOA in LLMs. In\ncontrast to computationally prohibitive multi-objective optimization (MOO)\nmethods, PAMA transforms multi-objective RLHF into a convex optimization with a\nclosed-form solution, significantly enhancing scalability. Traditional MOO\napproaches suffer from prohibitive O(n^2*d) complexity, where d represents the\nnumber of model parameters, typically in the billions for LLMs, rendering\ndirect optimization infeasible. PAMA reduces this complexity to O(n) where n is\nthe number of objectives, enabling optimization to be completed within\nmilliseconds. We provide theoretical guarantees that PAMA converges to a Pareto\nstationary point, where no objective can be improved without degrading at least\none other. Extensive experiments across language models ranging from 125M to 7B\nparameters demonstrate PAMA's robust and effective MOA capabilities, aligning\nwith its theoretical advantages.

The main idea behind 3DGS is to represent the scene as a\ncollection of 3D gaussians, while learning their parameters to fit the given\nviews of the scene. While achieving superior performance in the presence of\nmany views, 3DGS struggles with sparse view reconstruction, where the input\nviews are sparse and do not fully cover the scene and have low overlaps. In\nthis paper, we propose DIP-GS, a Deep Image Prior (DIP) 3DGS representation.

However, existing PEFT-based approaches overlook their\nvulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we show that highly\ntransferable adversarial images can be crafted solely via the upstream model,\nwithout accessing the downstream model or training data, significantly\ndegrading the IFDL performance. To address this, we propose ForensicsSAM, a\nunified IFDL framework with built-in adversarial robustness. Our design is\nguided by three key ideas: (1) To compensate for the lack of forgery-relevant\nknowledge in the frozen image encoder, we inject forgery experts into each\ntransformer block to enhance its ability to capture forgery artifacts. These\nforgery experts are always activated and shared across any input images. (2) To\ndetect adversarial images, we design an light-weight adversary detector that\nlearns to capture structured, task-specific artifact in RGB domain, enabling\nreliable discrimination across various attack methods. (3) To resist\nadversarial attacks, we inject adversary experts into the global attention\nlayers and MLP modules to progressively correct feature shifts induced by\nadversarial noise.

To address this challenge, we\npropose Score Augmentation (ScoreAug), a novel data augmentation framework\nspecifically designed for diffusion models. Unlike conventional augmentation\napproaches that operate on clean data, ScoreAug applies transformations to\nnoisy data, aligning with the inherent denoising mechanism of diffusion.\nCrucially, ScoreAug further requires the denoiser to predict the augmentation\nof the original target. This design establishes an equivariant learning\nobjective, enabling the denoiser to learn scores across varied denoising\nspaces, thereby realizing what we term score augmentation. We also\ntheoretically analyze the relationship between scores in different spaces under\ngeneral transformations.

To mitigate this, we propose a two-stage framework that\nsystematically exploits inherent learning bias in models. The learning bias\nstems from: (1) the statistical dominance of normal samples, driving models to\nprioritize learning stable normal patterns over sparse anomalies, and (2)\nfeature-space divergence, where normal data exhibit high intra-class\nconsistency while anomalies display high diversity, leading to unstable model\nresponses. Leveraging the learning bias, stage 1 partitions the training set\ninto subsets, trains sub-models, and aggregates cross-model anomaly scores to\nfilter a purified dataset. Stage 2 trains the final detector on this dataset.\nExperiments on the Real-IAD benchmark demonstrate superior anomaly detection\nand localization performance under different noise conditions.

This makes it difficult to\ndistinguish genuine comprehension from correct answers derived through flawed\nreasoning or hallucinations. To address this, we introduce AURA (Audio-visual\nUnderstanding and Reasoning Assessment), a benchmark for evaluating the\ncross-modal reasoning capabilities of Audio-Visual Large Language Models\n(AV-LLMs) and Omni-modal Language Models (OLMs). AURA includes questions across\nsix challenging cognitive domains, such as causality, timbre and pitch, tempo\nand AV synchronization, unanswerability, implicit distractions, and skill\nprofiling, explicitly designed to be unanswerable from a single modality. This\nforces models to construct a valid logical path grounded in both audio and\nvideo, setting AURA apart from AV datasets that allow uni-modal shortcuts. To\nassess reasoning traces, we propose a novel metric, AuraScore, which addresses\nthe lack of robust tools for evaluating reasoning fidelity.

I\ncreated a dataset of images from a real-world scene and constructed 3D models\nusing both methods. To evaluate the performance, I compared the models using\nstructural similarity index (SSIM), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), learned\nperceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS), and lp/mm resolution based on the\nUSAF resolution chart. A significant contribution of this work is the\ndevelopment of a modified Gaussian Splatting repository, which I forked and\nenhanced to enable rendering images from novel camera poses generated in the\nBlender environment. This innovation allows for the synthesis of high-quality\nnovel views, showcasing the flexibility and potential of Gaussian Splatting. My\ninvestigation extends to an augmented dataset that includes both original\nground images and novel views synthesized via Gaussian Splatting. This\naugmented dataset was employed to generate a new photogrammetry model, which\nwas then compared against the original photogrammetry model created using only\nthe original images. The results demonstrate the efficacy of using Gaussian\nSplatting to generate novel high-quality views and its potential to improve\nphotogrammetry-based 3D reconstructions.

We construct a labeled dataset by running four exact MCP\nalgorithms on a diverse collection of graph instances, accompanied by\nstructural and global statistical features extracted from each graph.

Experimental results show that RF consistently shows strong\nperformance across metrics and dataset variants, making it a reliable baseline.\nIn addition, feature importance analysis indicates that connectivity and\ntopological structure are strong predictors of algorithm performance. Building\non these findings, we develop a dual-channel model named GAT-MLP, which\ncombines a Graph Attention Network (GAT) for local structural encoding with a\nMultilayer Perceptron (MLP) for global feature modeling.

In this paper, we introduce\na high-quality text image SR framework designed to restore the precise strokes\nof low-resolution (LR) Chinese characters. Unlike methods that rely on\ncharacter recognition priors to regularize the SR task, we propose a novel\nstructure prior that offers structure-level guidance to enhance visual quality.\nOur framework incorporates this structure prior within a StyleGAN model,\nleveraging its generative capabilities for restoration. To maintain the\nintegrity of character structures while accommodating various font styles and\nlayouts, we implement a codebook-based mechanism that restricts the generative\nspace of StyleGAN.

Through the collaborative\ninteraction between the codebook and style, we generate a high-resolution\nstructure prior that aligns with LR characters both spatially and structurally.\nExperiments demonstrate that this structure prior provides robust,\ncharacter-specific guidance, enabling the accurate restoration of clear strokes\nin degraded characters, even for real-world LR Chinese text with irregular\nlayouts.

Simulating students' memory states is a\npromising approach to enhance both the performance and interpretability of\nknowledge tracing models. Memory consists of three fundamental processes:\nencoding, storage, and retrieval. Although forgetting primarily manifests\nduring the storage stage, most existing studies rely on a single,\nundifferentiated forgetting mechanism, overlooking other memory processes as\nwell as personalized forgetting patterns. To address this, this paper proposes\nmemoryKT, a knowledge tracing model based on a novel temporal variational\nautoencoder.

To\nsupport these connections, we design granular pyramid convolution (GPC) and\ncross-scale attention (CSA) modules for efficient fusion of low-scale and\nhigh-scale features, respectively. On top of the encoder, a self-attention\nmodule is built to learn global information, enabling accurate object\nlocalization with negligible computational cost. Unlike traditional U-Net-based\napproaches, our proposed method optimizes feature utilization and semantic\ninterpretation while applying appropriate supervision at each processing stage.\nExtensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves a new\nstate-of-the-art performance among lightweight image and video SOD models.

This lack of interpretability hinders\ntheir usability in real-world decision-making contexts, especially for\nnon-expert users. In this paper, we present DF-P2E (Deepfake: Prediction to\nExplanation), a novel multimodal framework that integrates visual, semantic,\nand narrative layers of explanation to make deepfake detection interpretable\nand accessible. The framework consists of three modular components: (1) a\ndeepfake classifier with Grad-CAM-based saliency visualisation, (2) a visual\ncaptioning module that generates natural language summaries of manipulated\nregions, and (3) a narrative refinement module that uses a fine-tuned Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) to produce context-aware, user-sensitive explanations.

Federated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving\nframework for collaborative training, but standard aggregation methods like\nFederated Averaging (FedAvg) can be biased by dominant datasets in\nheterogeneous settings. This paper investigates FL for seizure prediction using\na single EEG channel across four diverse public datasets (Siena, CHB-MIT,\nHelsinki, NCH), representing distinct patient populations (adult, pediatric,\nneonate) and recording conditions. We implement privacy-preserving global\nnormalization and propose a Random Subset Aggregation strategy, where each\nclient trains on a fixed-size random subset of its data per round, ensuring\nequal contribution during aggregation. Our results show that locally trained\nmodels fail to generalize across sites, and standard weighted FedAvg yields\nhighly skewed performance (e.g., 89.0% accuracy on CHB-MIT but only 50.8% on\nHelsinki and 50.6% on NCH). In contrast, Random Subset Aggregation\nsignificantly improves performance on under-represented clients (accuracy\nincreases to 81.7% on Helsinki and 68.7% on NCH) and achieves a superior\nmacro-average accuracy of 77.1% and pooled accuracy of 80.0% across all sites,\ndemonstrating a more robust and fair global model.

The key idea of LaVieID is to mitigate the loss of identity\ninformation inherent in the stochastic global generation process of diffusion\ntransformers (DiTs) from both spatial and temporal perspectives. Specifically,\nunlike the global and unstructured modeling of facial latent states in existing\nDiTs, LaVieID introduces a local router to explicitly represent latent states\nby weighted combinations of fine-grained local facial structures. This\nalleviates undesirable feature interference and encourages DiTs to capture\ndistinctive facial characteristics. Furthermore, a temporal autoregressive\nmodule is integrated into LaVieID to refine denoised latent tokens before video\ndecoding.

This is the author's original preprint", "summary": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a prevalent cardiac arrhythmia often treated with\ncatheter ablation procedures, but procedural outcomes are highly variable.\nEvaluating and improving ablation efficacy is challenging due to the complex\ninteraction between patient-specific tissue and procedural factors. This paper\nasks two questions: Can AF recurrence be predicted by simulating the effects of\nprocedural parameters? How should we ablate to reduce AF recurrence? We propose\nSOFA (Simulating and Optimizing Atrial Fibrillation Ablation), a novel\ndeep-learning framework that addresses these questions. SOFA first simulates\nthe outcome of an ablation strategy by generating a post-ablation image\ndepicting scar formation, conditioned on a patient's pre-ablation LGE-MRI and\nthe specific procedural parameters used (e.g., ablation locations, duration,\ntemperature, power, and force). During this simulation, it predicts AF\nrecurrence risk. Critically, SOFA then introduces an optimization scheme that\nrefines these procedural parameters to minimize the predicted risk.

This method\nachieves geometric depth unification and high-accuracy reconstruction by\nconstraining nearby depth maps and aligning 3D normals. Specifically, for the\nreconstruction of small indoor and outdoor scenes, we propose a multi-view\ndistance reprojection regularization module that achieves multi-view Gaussian\nalignment by computing the distance loss between two nearby views and the same\nGaussian surface. Additionally, we develop a multi-view normal enhancement\nmodule, which ensures consistency across views by matching the normals of pixel\npoints in nearby views and calculating the loss.

However, their sequential nature leads to long inference\ntimes, limiting their practical scalability. In this work, we introduce Grouped\nSpeculative Decoding (GSD), a novel, training-free acceleration method for AR\nimage models. While recent studies have explored Speculative Decoding (SD) as a\nmeans to speed up AR image generation, existing approaches either provide only\nmodest acceleration or require additional training. Our in-depth analysis\nreveals a fundamental difference between language and image tokens: image\ntokens exhibit inherent redundancy and diversity, meaning multiple tokens can\nconvey valid semantics. However, traditional SD methods are designed to accept\nonly a single most-likely token, which fails to leverage this difference,\nleading to excessive false-negative rejections. To address this, we propose a\nnew SD strategy that evaluates clusters of visually valid tokens rather than\nrelying on a single target token. Additionally, we observe that static\nclustering based on embedding distance is ineffective, which motivates our\ndynamic GSD approach.

Consequently,\nreference segmentation, which leverages reference images and their\ncorresponding masks to impart novel knowledge to the model, emerges as a\npromising new direction for adapting vision models. However, existing reference\nsegmentation approaches predominantly rely on meta-learning, which still\nnecessitates an extensive meta-training process and brings massive data and\ncomputational cost. In this study, we propose a novel approach by representing\nthe inherent correspondence between reference-target image pairs as a pseudo\nvideo. This perspective allows the latest version of SAM, known as SAM2, which\nis equipped with interactive video object segmentation (iVOS) capabilities, to\nbe adapted to downstream tasks in a lightweight manner.

Moreover, we introduce a non-trivial solution for\nsnippet-based gait recognition, focusing on Snippet Sampling and Snippet\nModeling as key components. Extensive experiments on four widely-used gait\ndatasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach and, more\nimportantly, highlight the potential of gait snippets.

Manual inspection is inefficient and error-prone, while\ntraditional vision algorithms struggle with densely packed plates, low\ncontrast, scale variation, and imaging artifacts. To address this issue and\ndrive more attention into this meaningful task, we present PBD5K, the first\nlarge-scale benchmark for this task, consisting of 5,000 X-ray images from nine\nbattery types with fine-grained annotations and eight types of real-world\nvisual interference.

We formulate\nPBD as a point-level segmentation problem and propose MDCNeXt, a model designed\nto extract and integrate multi-dimensional structure clues including point,\nline, and count information from the plate itself. To improve discrimination\nbetween plates and suppress visual interference, MDCNeXt incorporates two state\nspace modules.

However,\nexisting NR-IQA methods either focus on global representations that leads to\nlimited insights into the semantically salient regions or employ a uniform\nweighting for region features that weakens the sensitivity to local quality\nvariations. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained image quality assessment\nmodel, named RSFIQA, which integrates region-level distortion information to\nperceive multi-dimensional quality discrepancies. To enhance regional quality\nawareness, we first utilize the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to dynamically\npartition the input image into non-overlapping semantic regions.

In this study, we propose Deep Space Weather\nModel (Deep SWM), which is based on multiple deep state space models for\nhandling both ten-channel solar images and long-range spatio-temporal\ndependencies. Deep SWM also features a sparse masked autoencoder, a novel\npretraining strategy that employs a two-phase masking approach to preserve\ncrucial regions such as sunspots while compressing spatial information.\nFurthermore, we built FlareBench, a new public benchmark for solar flare\nprediction covering a full 11-year solar activity cycle, to validate our\nmethod.

However, existing\nvision-language-motion models (VLMMs) face significant limitations that hinder\ntheir practical deployment. We identify controllability as a main bottleneck,\nmanifesting in five key aspects: inadequate response to diverse human commands,\nlimited pose initialization capabilities, poor performance on long-term\nsequences, insufficient handling of unseen scenarios, and lack of fine-grained\ncontrol over individual body parts. To overcome these limitations, we present\nBeing-M0.5, the first real-time, controllable VLMM that achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across multiple motion generation tasks. Our\napproach is built upon HuMo100M, the largest and most comprehensive human\nmotion dataset to date, comprising over 5 million self-collected motion\nsequences, 100 million multi-task instructional instances, and detailed\npart-level annotations that address a critical gap in existing datasets. We\nintroduce a novel part-aware residual quantization technique for motion\ntokenization that enables precise, granular control over individual body parts\nduring generation. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates Being-M0.5's\nsuperior performance across diverse motion benchmarks, while comprehensive\nefficiency analysis confirms its real-time capabilities.

Weakly supervised affordance\ngrounding (WSAG) seeks to imitate human learning from third-person\ndemonstrations, where humans intuitively grasp functional parts without needing\npixel-level annotations. To achieve this, grounding is typically learned using\na shared classifier across images from different perspectives, along with\ndistillation strategies incorporating part discovery process. However, since\naffordance-relevant parts are not always easily distinguishable, models\nprimarily rely on classification, often focusing on common class-specific\npatterns that are unrelated to affordance.

Most existing video matting datasets provide only\nhuman-annotated imperfect alpha and foreground annotations, which must be\ncomposited to background images or videos during the training stage. Thus, the\ngeneralization capability of previous methods in real-world scenarios is\ntypically poor. In this work, we propose to solve the problem from two\nperspectives. First, we emphasize the importance of large-scale pre-training by\npursuing diverse synthetic and pseudo-labeled segmentation datasets. We also\ndevelop a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline that can render diverse\nhuman bodies and fine-grained hairs, yielding around 200 video clips with a\n3-second duration for fine-tuning. Second, we introduce a novel video matting\napproach that can effectively leverage the rich priors from pre-trained video\ndiffusion models. This architecture offers two key advantages. First, strong\npriors play a critical role in bridging the domain gap between synthetic and\nreal-world scenes.

Recently, zero-shot VTG methods have gained\nattention by leveraging pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) to localize\ntarget moments without additional training. However, existing approaches suffer\nfrom semantic fragmentation, where temporally continuous frames sharing the\nsame semantics are split across multiple segments. When segments are\nfragmented, it becomes difficult to predict an accurate target moment that\naligns with the text query.

Modern facial recognition systems are trained using large\nface datasets collected from diverse individuals or public repositories.\nHowever, for training, these datasets are often replicated and stored in\nmultiple workstations, resulting in data replication, which complicates\ndatabase management and oversight. Currently, once a user submits their face\nfor dataset preparation, they lose control over how their data is used, raising\nsignificant privacy and ethical concerns. This paper introduces VOIDFace, a\nnovel framework for facial recognition systems that addresses two major issues.\nFirst, it eliminates the need of data replication and improves data control to\nsecurely store training face data by using visual secret sharing. Second, it\nproposes a patch-based multi-training network that uses this novel training\ndata storage mechanism to develop a robust, privacy-preserving facial\nrecognition system. By integrating these advancements, VOIDFace aims to improve\nthe privacy, security, and efficiency of facial recognition training, while\nensuring greater control over sensitive personal face data. VOIDFace also\nenables users to exercise their Right-To-Be-Forgotten property to control their\npersonal data. Experimental evaluations on the VGGFace2 dataset show that\nVOIDFace provides Right-To-Be-Forgotten, improved data control, security, and\nprivacy while maintaining competitive facial recognition performance.

A Multimodal\nDepression Detection Network (MDD-Net), utilizing acoustic and visual data\nobtained from social media networks, is proposed in this work where mutual\ntransformers are exploited to efficiently extract and fuse multimodal features\nfor efficient depression detection. The MDD-Net consists of four core modules:\nan acoustic feature extraction module for retrieving relevant acoustic\nattributes, a visual feature extraction module for extracting significant\nhigh-level patterns, a mutual transformer for computing the correlations among\nthe generated features and fusing these features from multiple modalities, and\na detection layer for detecting depression using the fused feature\nrepresentations. The extensive experiments are performed using the multimodal\nD-Vlog dataset, and the findings reveal that the developed multimodal\ndepression detection network surpasses the state-of-the-art by up to 17.37% for\nF1-Score, demonstrating the greater performance of the proposed system.

Our experiments demonstrate that while RGB and\ngeometric methods achieve comparable performance on datasets with apparent\nsimulation artifacts, RGB models suffer a 12% accuracy drop in realistic\nclinical settings with decreased visual diversity due to standardizations.

However, a\nfundamental gap exists between the LQ image latent distribution and the\nGaussian noisy latent distribution, limiting the effective utilization of\ngenerative priors.

This\nyields outputs that may be visually coherent but lack narrative sophistication\nand true cinematic integrity. To bridge this, we introduce Next Shot Generation\n(NSG): synthesizing a subsequent, high-quality shot that critically conforms to\nprofessional editing patterns while upholding rigorous cinematic continuity.\nOur framework, Cut2Next, leverages a Diffusion Transformer (DiT). It employs\nin-context tuning guided by a novel Hierarchical Multi-Prompting strategy. This\nstrategy uses Relational Prompts to define overall context and inter-shot\nediting styles. Individual Prompts then specify per-shot content and\ncinematographic attributes. Together, these guide Cut2Next to generate\ncinematically appropriate next shots. Architectural innovations, Context-Aware\nCondition Injection (CACI) and Hierarchical Attention Mask (HAM), further\nintegrate these diverse signals without introducing new parameters.

However, their effectiveness\nis often limited by redundant token representations and a lack of multi-scale\nfeature modeling. Hyperspectral images exhibit intrinsic spectral priors (e.g.,\nabundance sparsity) and spatial priors (e.g., non-local similarity), which are\ncritical for accurate reconstruction. From a spectral-spatial perspective,\nVision Transformers (ViTs) face two major limitations: they struggle to\npreserve high-frequency components--such as material edges and texture\ntransitions--and suffer from attention dispersion across redundant tokens.\nThese issues stem from the global self-attention mechanism, which tends to\ndilute high-frequency signals and overlook localized details. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Token-wise High-frequency Augmentation Transformer\n(THAT), a novel framework designed to enhance hyperspectral pansharpening\nthrough improved high-frequency feature representation and token selection.\nSpecifically, THAT introduces: (1) Pivotal Token Selective Attention (PTSA) to\nprioritize informative tokens and suppress redundancy; (2) a Multi-level\nVariance-aware Feed-forward Network (MVFN) to enhance high-frequency detail\nlearning.

Conditioned on a reference image and audio,\nStableAvatar integrates tailored training and inference modules to enable\ninfinite-length video generation.
