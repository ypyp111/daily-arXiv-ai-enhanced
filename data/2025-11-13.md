Abstract: The energy transition is a key theme of the last decades to determine a future of eco-sustainability, and an area of such importance cannot disregard digitization, innovation and the new technological tools available. This is the context in which the Generative Artificial Intelligence models described in this paper are positioned, developed by Engineering Ingegneria Informatica SpA in order to automate the plant structures acquisition of SNAM energy infrastructure, a leading gas transportation company in Italy and Europe. The digitization of a gas plant consists in registering all its relevant information through the interpretation of the related documentation. The aim of this work is therefore to design an effective solution based on Artificial Intelligence techniques to automate the extraction of the information necessary for the digitization of a plant, in order to streamline the daily work of MGM users. The solution received the P&ID of the plant as input, each one in pdf format, and uses OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, Relational Reasoning and optimization algorithms to return an output consisting of two sets of information: a structured overview of the relevant design data and the hierarchical framework of the plant. To achieve convincing results, we extend a state-of-the-art model for Scene Graph Generation introducing a brand new Transformer architecture with the aim of deepening the analysis of the complex relations between the plant's components. The synergistic use of the listed AI-based technologies allowed to overcome many obstacles arising from the high variety of data, due to the lack of standardization. An accuracy of 91\% has been achieved in the extraction of textual information relating to design data. Regarding the plants topology, 93\% of components are correctly identified and the hierarchical structure is extracted with an accuracy around 80\%.

TL;DR: 提出了一种系统性的评估方法来分析和量化说话人脸生成中的嘴唇泄漏问题，包括三种测试设置和衍生指标，为未来研究建立更可靠的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于修复的说话人脸生成方法在保持说话者一致性的同时，可能会引入嘴唇泄漏问题，即生成的嘴唇受到参考图像的影响而非仅由驱动音频决定，而这一问题难以通过标准指标和常规测试设置检测。

Method: 提出了一个系统性评估框架，包含三种互补的测试设置：静音输入生成、不匹配的音频-视频配对和匹配的音频-视频合成，并引入了嘴唇同步差异和基于静音音频的嘴唇同步分数等衍生指标。

Result: 该评估方法能够有效分析和量化嘴唇泄漏问题，并研究了不同身份参考选择对泄漏的影响，为参考设计提供了见解。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法是模型无关的，为说话人脸生成领域的未来研究建立了更可靠的评估基准。

Abstract: Inpainting-based talking face generation aims to preserve video details such as pose, lighting, and gestures while modifying only lip motion, often using an identity reference image to maintain speaker consistency. However, this mechanism can introduce lip leaking, where generated lips are influenced by the reference image rather than solely by the driving audio. Such leakage is difficult to detect with standard metrics and conventional test setup. To address this, we propose a systematic evaluation methodology to analyze and quantify lip leakage. Our framework employs three complementary test setups: silent-input generation, mismatched audio-video pairing, and matched audio-video synthesis. We also introduce derived metrics including lip-sync discrepancy and silent-audio-based lip-sync scores. In addition, we study how different identity reference selections affect leakage, providing insights into reference design. The proposed methodology is model-agnostic and establishes a more reliable benchmark for future research in talking face generation.

TL;DR: MATRIX是一个多无人机监控数据集和深度学习框架，用于解决动态摄像头位置和复杂遮挡下的行人跟踪问题。该框架通过实时摄像头校准、特征融合和鸟瞰图表示，在复杂环境中保持约90%的检测跟踪精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在动态摄像头位置和复杂遮挡情况下表现不佳，需要更鲁棒的多视角监控系统来处理城市环境中的行人跟踪挑战。

Method: 提出MATRIX数据集（8个无人机同步视频）和深度学习框架，包含实时摄像头校准、基于特征的图像配准、多视角特征融合到鸟瞰图表示。

Result: 在复杂环境中保持约90%的检测跟踪精度，成功跟踪约80%的轨迹，迁移学习显示强泛化能力，摄像头丢失实验显示性能优雅下降。

Conclusion: MATRIX数据集和框架为动态多视角监控系统提供了重要基准，展示了在实际部署中的鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: Multi-drone surveillance systems offer enhanced coverage and robustness for pedestrian tracking, yet existing approaches struggle with dynamic camera positions and complex occlusions. This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment. Our framework addresses the unique challenges of dynamic drone-based surveillance through real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Experimental results demonstrate that while static camera methods maintain over 90\% detection and tracking precision and accuracy metrics in a simplified MATRIX environment without an obstruction, 10 pedestrians and a much smaller observational area, their performance significantly degrades in the complex environment. Our proposed approach maintains robust performance with $\sim$90\% detection and tracking accuracy, as well as successfully tracks $\sim$80\% of trajectories under challenging conditions. Transfer learning experiments reveal strong generalization capabilities, with the pretrained model achieving much higher detection and tracking accuracy performance compared to training the model from scratch. Additionally, systematic camera dropout experiments reveal graceful performance degradation, demonstrating practical robustness for real-world deployments where camera failures may occur. The MATRIX dataset and framework provide essential benchmarks for advancing dynamic multi-view surveillance systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于Grassmann流形的拓扑驱动多子空间融合框架，通过自适应子空间协作和Fréchet均值优化，在3D动作识别、EEG分类和图任务中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖静态单子空间表示，忽略了多子空间间的动态交互对捕捉复杂几何结构的重要性。

Method: 1) 基于Kolmogorov-Arnold表示定理的自适应多子空间建模机制；2) 通过流形上Fréchet均值优化的多子空间交互块；3) 结合黎曼批量归一化和互信息正则化。

Conclusion: 该工作不仅推进了几何深度学习，还将欧几里得网络中已验证的多通道交互哲学成功适应到非欧几里得领域，实现了优越的判别性和可解释性。

Abstract: Grassmannian manifold offers a powerful carrier for geometric representation learning by modelling high-dimensional data as low-dimensional subspaces. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on static single-subspace representations, neglecting the dynamic interplay between multiple subspaces critical for capturing complex geometric structures. To address this limitation, we propose a topology-driven multi-subspace fusion framework that enables adaptive subspace collaboration on the Grassmannian. Our solution introduces two key innovations: (1) Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, an adaptive multi-subspace modelling mechanism is proposed that dynamically selects and weights task-relevant subspaces via topological convergence analysis, and (2) a multi-subspace interaction block that fuses heterogeneous geometric representations through Fréchet mean optimisation on the manifold. Theoretically, we establish the convergence guarantees of adaptive subspaces under a projection metric topology, ensuring stable gradient-based optimisation. Practically, we integrate Riemannian batch normalisation and mutual information regularisation to enhance discriminability and robustness. Extensive experiments on 3D action recognition (HDM05, FPHA), EEG classification (MAMEM-SSVEPII), and graph tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Our work not only advances geometric deep learning but also successfully adapts the proven multi-channel interaction philosophy of Euclidean networks to non-Euclidean domains, achieving superior discriminability and interpretability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TTM是一个无需训练、即插即用的视频生成框架，通过粗参考动画实现精确的运动控制，同时保持外观一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于图像和文本的视频生成方法无法提供精确的运动控制，而需要特定模型微调的方法计算成本高且限制性强。

Method: 使用用户友好的操作（如剪切拖拽或深度重投影）获得粗参考动画作为运动线索，采用双时钟去噪策略在运动指定区域强制对齐，同时允许其他区域保持灵活性。

Result: 在物体和相机运动基准测试中，TTM在真实感和运动控制方面达到或超过了现有基于训练的基线方法。

Conclusion: TTM提供了一种轻量级、无需训练的视频生成解决方案，能够实现精确的运动和外观控制，超越了仅使用文本提示的限制。

Abstract: Diffusion-based video generation can create realistic videos, yet existing image- and text-based conditioning fails to offer precise motion control. Prior methods for motion-conditioned synthesis typically require model-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and restrictive. We introduce Time-to-Move (TTM), a training-free, plug-and-play framework for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation with image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models. Our key insight is to use crude reference animations obtained through user-friendly manipulations such as cut-and-drag or depth-based reprojection. Motivated by SDEdit's use of coarse layout cues for image editing, we treat the crude animations as coarse motion cues and adapt the mechanism to the video domain. We preserve appearance with image conditioning and introduce dual-clock denoising, a region-dependent strategy that enforces strong alignment in motion-specified regions while allowing flexibility elsewhere, balancing fidelity to user intent with natural dynamics. This lightweight modification of the sampling process incurs no additional training or runtime cost and is compatible with any backbone. Extensive experiments on object and camera motion benchmarks show that TTM matches or exceeds existing training-based baselines in realism and motion control. Beyond this, TTM introduces a unique capability: precise appearance control through pixel-level conditioning, exceeding the limits of text-only prompting.

### [6] [CADIC: Continual Anomaly Detection Based on Incremental Coreset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08634)
*Gen Yang,Zhipeng Deng,Junfeng Man*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的持续异常检测框架，所有任务共享统一内存库，通过固定大小的核心集增量更新嵌入，避免了任务特定的内存碎片化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于嵌入的持续异常检测方法需要为每个任务构建特定类别的子内存库，这限制了方法的灵活性和可扩展性。

Method: 使用统一内存库，在训练阶段通过固定大小的核心集增量更新嵌入，推理阶段通过最近邻匹配机制计算异常分数。

Result: 在MVTec AD和Visa数据集上分别达到0.972和0.891的平均图像级AUROC分数，在真实电子纸数据集上实现100%的异常样本检测准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法在持续异常检测中实现了最先进的检测精度，并验证了在实际场景中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The primary objective of Continual Anomaly Detection (CAD) is to learn the normal patterns of new tasks under dynamic data distribution assumptions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Existing embedding-based CAD approaches continuously update a memory bank with new embeddings to adapt to sequential tasks. However, these methods require constructing class-specific sub-memory banks for each task, which restricts their flexibility and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CAD framework where all tasks share a unified memory bank. During training, the method incrementally updates embeddings within a fixed-size coreset, enabling continuous knowledge acquisition from sequential tasks without task-specific memory fragmentation. In the inference phase, anomaly scores are computed via a nearest-neighbor matching mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art detection accuracy. We validate the method through comprehensive experiments on MVTec AD and Visa datasets. Results show that our approach outperforms existing baselines, achieving average image-level AUROC scores of 0.972 (MVTec AD) and 0.891 (Visa). Notably, on a real-world electronic paper dataset, it demonstrates 100% accuracy in anomaly sample detection, confirming its robustness in practical scenarios. The implementation will be open-sourced on GitHub.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个结合扩散去噪和时间感知actor-critic模型的统一框架，用于自动驾驶中的事故预测，在传感器退化和噪声条件下实现早期可靠预警。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶事故预测中的两个关键挑战：传感器输入噪声或退化（天气、运动模糊、硬件限制），以及需要及时可靠的预测以平衡早期警报与误报抑制。

Method: 集成扩散去噪模块（通过迭代细化重建噪声弹性特征）和时间感知actor-critic模型（利用长期时间推理和时间加权奖励确定最佳预警时机）。

Result: 在三个基准数据集（DAD、CCD、A3D）上实现最先进精度，显著提高平均事故时间，在Gaussian和脉冲噪声下保持鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: 该模型在常规和复杂交通场景中产生更早、更稳定、更符合人类判断的预测，具有现实世界安全关键部署的潜力。

Abstract: Accident anticipation is essential for proactive and safe autonomous driving, where even a brief advance warning can enable critical evasive actions. However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) noisy or degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and (2) the need to issue timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression. We propose a unified framework that integrates diffusion-based denoising with a time-aware actor-critic model to address these challenges. The diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient image and object features through iterative refinement, preserving critical motion and interaction cues under sensor degradation. In parallel, the actor-critic architecture leverages long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine the optimal moment to raise an alert, aligning early detection with reliability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and significant gains in mean time-to-accident, while maintaining robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise. Qualitative analyses further show that our model produces earlier, more stable, and human-aligned predictions in both routine and highly complex traffic scenarios, highlighting its potential for real-world, safety-critical deployment.

*Hae-Won Jo,Yeong-Jun Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RS-Net框架，通过空间交互和长程时序上下文对物体对的关系重要性进行评分，提升动态场景图生成中的关系预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DSGG方法只对标注的物体对进行训练，缺乏对非相关对的指导，导致推理时难以识别有意义的关系。

Method: RS-Net包含空间上下文编码器（带可学习上下文标记）和时序编码器，通过统一的三元组评分机制整合关系分数。

Result: 在Action Genome数据集上，RS-Net显著提升了Recall和Precision，特别是在mean Recall上有明显提升，能有效处理关系的长尾分布。

Conclusion: RS-Net能轻松集成到现有DSGG模型中，在保持竞争力的效率下，实现了优于最先进方法的性能。

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) models how object relations evolve over time in videos. However, existing methods are trained only on annotated object pairs and lack guidance for non-related pairs, making it difficult to identify meaningful relations during inference. In this paper, we propose Relation Scoring Network (RS-Net), a modular framework that scores the contextual importance of object pairs using both spatial interactions and long-range temporal context. RS-Net consists of a spatial context encoder with learnable context tokens and a temporal encoder that aggregates video-level information. The resulting relation scores are integrated into a unified triplet scoring mechanism to enhance relation prediction. RS-Net can be easily integrated into existing DSGG models without architectural changes. Experiments on the Action Genome dataset show that RS-Net consistently improves both Recall and Precision across diverse baselines, with notable gains in mean Recall, highlighting its ability to address the long-tailed distribution of relations. Despite the increased number of parameters, RS-Net maintains competitive efficiency, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

### [9] [Privacy Beyond Pixels: Latent Anonymization for Privacy-Preserving Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08666)
*Joseph Fioresi,Ishan Rajendrakumar Dave,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种在潜在空间中保护视频基础模型视觉隐私的新方法，通过轻量级匿名化适配器模块从视频特征中移除私人信息，同时保持通用任务效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频基础模型提取的时空特征在共享或存储时会无意中泄露敏感个人信息（如肤色、性别、服装），而现有的像素级匿名化方法需要重新训练整个模型，不适合视频基础模型。

Method: 设计了一个轻量级匿名化适配器模块（AAM），采用三种新的训练目标：剪辑级自监督隐私目标、协同训练目标保持已见任务效用、潜在一致性损失用于未见任务的泛化。

Result: 评估显示隐私泄露显著减少35%，同时在动作识别、时序动作检测和异常检测等下游任务中保持接近基线的效用性能，还能有效缓解动作识别模型中的性别偏见。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效且通用的视频隐私保护解决方案，能够在保护隐私的同时维持模型性能，并促进更公平的视频理解。

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation of visual privacy preservation for video foundation models that operates entirely in the latent space. While spatio-temporal features learned by foundation models have deepened general understanding of video content, sharing or storing these extracted visual features for downstream tasks inadvertently reveals sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing. Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features. Our framework employs three newly designed training objectives: (1) a clip-level self-supervised privacy objective to reduce mutual information between static clips, (2) a co-training objective to retain utility across seen tasks, and (3) a latent consistency loss for generalization on unseen tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a significant 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility performance across various downstream tasks: Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime). We also provide an analysis on anonymization for sensitive temporal attribute recognition. Additionally, we propose new protocols for assessing gender bias in action recognition models, showing that our method effectively mitigates such biases and promotes more equitable video understanding.

TL;DR: 本文研究了自回归逐像素预测的缩放特性，发现最优缩放策略高度依赖具体任务，且计算资源是主要瓶颈而非训练数据量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自回归逐像素预测这一简单但未被充分研究的统一视觉模型框架的缩放特性，了解不同任务下的最优扩展策略。

Method: 使用IsoFlops配置文件在32×32分辨率下训练一系列Transformer模型，计算预算高达7e19 FLOPs，评估三个目标指标：逐像素预测目标、ImageNet分类准确率和生成质量。

Result: 发现分类和生成任务的最优缩放策略存在分歧，生成任务需要数据量比分类任务快3-5倍增长；随着分辨率增加，模型大小需比数据量增长更快；计算资源是主要瓶颈。

Conclusion: 随着计算资源每年增长4-5倍，预测在5年内实现逐像素图像建模是可行的。

Abstract: This paper investigates the scaling properties of autoregressive next-pixel prediction, a simple, end-to-end yet under-explored framework for unified vision models. Starting with images at resolutions of 32x32, we train a family of Transformers using IsoFlops profiles across compute budgets up to 7e19 FLOPs and evaluate three distinct target metrics: next-pixel prediction objective, ImageNet classification accuracy, and generation quality measured by Fr'echet Distance. First, optimal scaling strategy is critically task-dependent. At a fixed 32x32 resolution alone, the optimal scaling properties for image classification and image generation diverge, where generation optimal setup requires the data size grow three to five times faster than for the classification optimal setup. Second, as image resolution increases, the optimal scaling strategy indicates that the model size must grow much faster than data size. Surprisingly, by projecting our findings, we discover that the primary bottleneck is compute rather than the amount of training data. As compute continues to grow four to five times annually, we forecast the feasibility of pixel-by-pixel modeling of images within the next five years.

*Abhipsa Basu,Aviral Gupta,Abhijnya Bhat,R. Venkatesh Babu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出使用多种扩散模型微调技术（如LoRA和DreamBooth）来生成更平衡的训练数据，以解决图像分类系统中的群体偏见问题。通过聚类和分组训练DreamBooth模型，生成平衡数据用于预训练，再在真实数据上微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分类系统常因训练数据中群体分布不均而继承偏见，例如人脸数据集中金发与女性的过度关联会强化刻板印象。现有方法使用Stable Diffusion生成平衡数据但难以保持原始数据分布。

Method: 探索多种扩散模型微调技术：1）使用LoRA和DreamBooth直接从样本学习以更准确表示每个训练群体；2）为防止单个DreamBooth模型被组内变异淹没，对每组图像进行聚类并为每个聚类训练一个DreamBooth模型；3）用这些模型生成群体平衡数据进行预训练，然后在真实数据上微调。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，所研究的微调方法平均优于原始Stable Diffusion，与最先进的去偏技术（如Group-DRO）结果相当，且随着数据集偏见严重程度增加而超越它们。

Conclusion: 通过扩散模型微调技术生成平衡训练数据是解决图像分类偏见的有效方法，特别是在偏见严重的数据集上表现优于现有技术。

Abstract: Image classification systems often inherit biases from uneven group representation in training data. For example, in face datasets for hair color classification, blond hair may be disproportionately associated with females, reinforcing stereotypes. A recent approach leverages the Stable Diffusion model to generate balanced training data, but these models often struggle to preserve the original data distribution. In this work, we explore multiple diffusion-finetuning techniques, e.g., LoRA and DreamBooth, to generate images that more accurately represent each training group by learning directly from their samples. Additionally, in order to prevent a single DreamBooth model from being overwhelmed by excessive intra-group variations, we explore a technique of clustering images within each group and train a DreamBooth model per cluster. These models are then used to generate group-balanced data for pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the studied finetuning approaches outperform vanilla Stable Diffusion on average and achieve results comparable to SOTA debiasing techniques like Group-DRO, while surpassing them as the dataset bias severity increases.

*Abu Taib Mohammed Shahjahan,A. Ben Hamza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PoseKAN框架，将Kolmogorov-Arnold网络扩展到基于图的2D到3D姿态提升，通过可学习的边函数和多跳特征聚合解决GCN的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GCN方法在3D人体姿态估计中受限于局部感受野，难以捕捉长距离依赖关系，且存在频谱偏差问题，优先处理低频分量而难以建模高频细节。

Method: 使用自适应图KAN框架，在边上的可学习函数实现数据驱动的特征变换；采用多跳特征聚合整合局部和远距离邻居信息；包含残差PoseKAN块进行深度特征优化；使用全局响应归一化提升特征选择性。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该模型在性能上可与最先进方法竞争。

Conclusion: PoseKAN框架通过自适应图KAN和先进的特征聚合机制，有效提升了3D人体姿态估计的性能，解决了GCN的局限性。

Abstract: Graph convolutional network (GCN)-based methods have shown strong performance in 3D human pose estimation by leveraging the natural graph structure of the human skeleton. However, their local receptive field limits their ability to capture long-range dependencies essential for handling occlusions and depth ambiguities. They also exhibit spectral bias, which prioritizes low-frequency components while struggling to model high-frequency details. In this paper, we introduce PoseKAN, an adaptive graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), framework that extends KANs to graph-based learning for 2D-to-3D pose lifting from a single image. Unlike GCNs that use fixed activation functions, KANs employ learnable functions on graph edges, allowing data-driven, adaptive feature transformations. This enhances the model's adaptability and expressiveness, making it more expressive in learning complex pose variations. Our model employs multi-hop feature aggregation, ensuring the body joints can leverage information from both local and distant neighbors, leading to improved spatial awareness. It also incorporates residual PoseKAN blocks for deeper feature refinement, and a global response normalization for improved feature selectivity and contrast. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our model against state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SIFT-Graph框架通过结构感知和扰动防御的统一模型，为视觉模型提供了有效的对抗攻击防御方案。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks expose a fundamental vulnerability in modern deep vision models by exploiting their dependence on dense, pixel-level representations that are highly sensitive to imperceptible perturbations. Traditional defense strategies typically operate within this fragile pixel domain, lacking mechanisms to incorporate inherently robust visual features. In this work, we introduce SIFT-Graph, a multimodal defense framework that enhances the robustness of traditional vision models by aggregating structurally meaningful features extracted from raw images using both handcrafted and learned modalities. Specifically, we integrate Scale-Invariant Feature Transform keypoints with a Graph Attention Network to capture scale and rotation invariant local structures that are resilient to perturbations. These robust feature embeddings are then fused with traditional vision model, such as Vision Transformer and Convolutional Neural Network, to form a unified, structure-aware and perturbation defensive model. Preliminary results demonstrate that our method effectively improves the visual model robustness against gradient-based white box adversarial attacks, while incurring only a marginal drop in clean accuracy.

Abstract: Generating novel views of a natural scene, e.g., every-day scenes both indoors and outdoors, from a single view is an under-explored problem, even though it is an organic extension to the object-centric novel view synthesis. Existing diffusion-based approaches focus rather on small camera movements in real scenes or only consider unnatural object-centric scenes, limiting their potential applications in real-world settings. In this paper we move away from these constrained regimes and propose a 3D diffusion model trained with image-only losses on a large-scale dataset of real-world, multi-category, unaligned, and casually acquired videos of everyday scenes. We propose DT-NVS, a 3D-aware diffusion model for generalized novel view synthesis that exploits a transformer-based architecture backbone. We make significant contributions to transformer and self-attention architectures to translate images to 3d representations, and novel camera conditioning strategies to allow training on real-world unaligned datasets. In addition, we introduce a novel training paradigm swapping the role of reference frame between the conditioning image and the sampled noisy input. We evaluate our approach on the 3D task of generalized novel view synthesis from a single input image and show improvements over state-of-the-art 3D aware diffusion models and deterministic approaches, while generating diverse outputs.

*Jiaxun Guo,Manar Amayri,Nizar Bouguila,Xin Liu,Wentao Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的旋转不变3D点云学习方法，通过引入阴影信息姿态特征(SiPF)和旋转不变注意力卷积(RIAttnConv)，解决了现有方法因感受野受限而无法区分几何相似但空间不同结构的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有旋转不变学习方法使用手工设计的RI特征替代原始坐标，虽然对任意旋转具有鲁棒性，但会丢失全局姿态信息，无法区分几何相似但空间不同的结构（如飞机左右机翼）。

Method: 1. 提出阴影信息姿态特征(SiPF)，通过学习的共享旋转生成全局一致的参考点（阴影），增强局部RI描述符；2. 设计旋转不变注意力卷积(RIAttnConv)，将SiPF集成到特征聚合过程中；3. 基于Bingham分布的任务自适应阴影定位模块，动态学习最优全局旋转。

Result: 在3D分类和部件分割基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于现有RI方法，特别是在需要细粒度空间区分的任务中。

Conclusion: 通过结合局部旋转不变性和全局姿态感知，提出的方法有效解决了Wing-tip特征崩溃问题，在保持旋转不变性的同时增强了空间区分能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in rotation-invariant (RI) learning for 3D point clouds typically replace raw coordinates with handcrafted RI features to ensure robustness under arbitrary rotations. However, these approaches often suffer from the loss of global pose information, making them incapable of distinguishing geometrically similar but spatially distinct structures. We identify that this limitation stems from the restricted receptive field in existing RI methods, leading to Wing-tip feature collapse, a failure to differentiate symmetric components (e.g., left and right airplane wings) due to indistinguishable local geometries. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF), which augments local RI descriptors with a globally consistent reference point (referred to as the 'shadow') derived from a learned shared rotation. This mechanism enables the model to preserve global pose awareness while maintaining rotation invariance. We further propose Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution (RIAttnConv), an attention-based operator that integrates SiPFs into the feature aggregation process, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish structurally similar components. Additionally, we design a task-adaptive shadow locating module based on the Bingham distribution over unit quaternions, which dynamically learns the optimal global rotation for constructing consistent shadows. Extensive experiments on 3D classification and part segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms existing RI methods, particularly in tasks requiring fine-grained spatial discrimination under arbitrary rotations.

TL;DR: 提出SAS-SSM模型，通过结构感知的时空卷积和跨步扫描策略，在保持线性复杂度的同时有效建模3D人体姿态的局部和全局依赖关系


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于状态空间模型的3D姿态估计方法通常使用手动设计的扫描操作将2D姿态序列展平为纯时间序列，这会破坏人体姿态的固有空间结构并纠缠时空特征，难以捕捉复杂的姿态依赖关系

Method: 提出SAS-SSM，首先使用结构感知的时空卷积动态捕捉关节间的局部交互，然后应用跨步扫描策略构建多尺度全局结构表示

Result: 基于SAS-SSM的SasMamba模型在3D姿态估计任务中取得了有竞争力的性能，且参数数量显著少于现有的混合模型

Conclusion: SAS-SSM能够灵活建模局部和全局姿态信息，同时保持线性计算复杂度，为3D人体姿态估计提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Recently, the Mamba architecture based on State Space Models (SSMs) has gained attention in 3D human pose estimation due to its linear complexity and strong global modeling capability. However, existing SSM-based methods typically apply manually designed scan operations to flatten detected 2D pose sequences into purely temporal sequences, either locally or globally. This approach disrupts the inherent spatial structure of human poses and entangles spatial and temporal features, making it difficult to capture complex pose dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose the Skeleton Structure-Aware Stride SSM (SAS-SSM), which first employs a structure-aware spatiotemporal convolution to dynamically capture essential local interactions between joints, and then applies a stride-based scan strategy to construct multi-scale global structural representations. This enables flexible modeling of both local and global pose information while maintaining linear computational complexity. Built upon SAS-SSM, our model SasMamba achieves competitive 3D pose estimation performance with significantly fewer parameters compared to existing hybrid models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对比学习网络通过参数共享或动量更新隐式交互，未能充分利用正样本对的互补性和相似性来提取聚类特征。

Method: 设计MFAVBs模块：1) 将两个预处理增强作为正样本对输入共享权重的ViTs；2) 融合输出特征输入更大的ViT；3) 将学习特征分割为新增强正样本对传递给后续FAVBs；4) 在实例级和聚类级空间计算交叉熵损失。

Result: 在7个公共数据集上的实验表明，MFAVBs作为对比聚类骨干网络在聚类性能上优于最先进技术。

Conclusion: 提出的MFAVBs通过显式特征融合和多重增强操作，有效提升了图像聚类的性能。

Abstract: In the field of image clustering, the widely used contrastive learning networks improve clustering performance by maximizing the similarity between positive pairs and the dissimilarity of negative pairs of the inputs. Extant contrastive learning networks, whose two encoders often implicitly interact with each other by parameter sharing or momentum updating, may not fully exploit the complementarity and similarity of the positive pairs to extract clustering features from input data. To explicitly fuse the learned features of positive pairs, we design a novel multiple fusing-augmenting ViT blocks (MFAVBs) based on the excellent feature learning ability of Vision Transformers (ViT). Firstly, two preprocessed augmentions as positive pairs are separately fed into two shared-weight ViTs, then their output features are fused to input into a larger ViT. Secondly, the learned features are split into a pair of new augmented positive samples and passed to the next FAVBs, enabling multiple fusion and augmention through MFAVBs operations. Finally, the learned features are projected into both instance-level and clustering-level spaces to calculate the cross-entropy loss, followed by parameter updates by backpropagation to finalize the training process. To further enhance ability of the model to distinguish between similar images, our input data for the network we propose is preprocessed augmentions with features extracted from the CLIP pretrained model. Our experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that MFAVBs serving as the backbone for contrastive clustering outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of clustering performance.

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common aggressive, fast-growing brain tumor, with a grim prognosis. Despite clinical diagnostic advancements, there have not been any substantial improvements to patient prognosis. Histopathological assessment of excised tumors is the first line of clinical diagnostic routine. We hypothesize that automated, robust, and accurate identification of distinct histological sub-regions within GBM could contribute to morphologically understanding this disease at scale. In this study, we designed a four-step deep learning approach to classify six (6) histopathological regions and quantitatively evaluated it on the BraTS-Path 2024 challenge dataset, which includes digitized Hematoxylin \& Eosin (H\&E) stained GBM tissue sections annotated for six distinct regions. We used the challenge's publicly available training dataset to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of several variants of EfficientNet architectures (i.e., B0, B1, B2, B3, B4). EfficientNet-B1 and EfficientNet-B4 achieved the best performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.98 in a 5-fold cross-validation configuration using the BraTS-Path training set. The quantitative performance evaluation of our proposed approach with EfficientNet-B1 on the BraTS-Path hold-out validation data and the final hidden testing data yielded F1 scores of 0.546 and 0.517, respectively, for the associated 6-class classification task. The difference in the performance on training, validation, and testing data highlights the challenge of developing models that generalize well to new data, which is crucial for clinical applications.

Abstract: Object recognition plays a fundamental role in how biological organisms perceive and interact with their environment. While the human visual system performs this task with remarkable efficiency, reproducing similar capabilities in artificial systems remains challenging. This study investigates VisNet, a biologically inspired neural network model, and several enhanced variants incorporating radial basis function neurons, Mahalanobis distance based learning, and retinal like preprocessing for both general object recognition and symmetry classification. By leveraging principles of Hebbian learning and temporal continuity associating temporally adjacent views to build invariant representations. VisNet and its extensions capture robust and transformation invariant features. Experimental results across multiple datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR10, and custom symmetric object sets, show that these enhanced VisNet variants substantially improve recognition accuracy compared with the baseline model. These findings underscore the adaptability and biological relevance of VisNet inspired architectures, offering a powerful and interpretable framework for visual recognition in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

Result: 在6种不同模型架构和多个数据集上的综合实验表明，与7种现有方法相比，该框架达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SemBridge框架有效解决了弱语义一致性下的跨模态知识蒸馏问题，在遥感场景分类中表现出色，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation has demonstrated promising performance on paired modalities with strong semantic connections, referred to as Symmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (SCKD). However, implementing SCKD becomes exceedingly constrained in real-world scenarios due to the limited availability of paired modalities. To this end, we investigate a general and effective knowledge learning concept under weak semantic consistency, dubbed Asymmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (ACKD), aiming to bridge modalities with limited semantic overlap. Nevertheless, the shift from strong to weak semantic consistency improves flexibility but exacerbates challenges in knowledge transmission costs, which we rigorously verified based on optimal transport theory. To mitigate the issue, we further propose a framework, namely SemBridge, integrating a Student-Friendly Matching module and a Semantic-aware Knowledge Alignment module. The former leverages self-supervised learning to acquire semantic-based knowledge and provide personalized instruction for each student sample by dynamically selecting the relevant teacher samples. The latter seeks the optimal transport path by employing Lagrangian optimization. To facilitate the research, we curate a benchmark dataset derived from two modalities, namely Multi-Spectral (MS) and asymmetric RGB images, tailored for remote sensing scene classification. Comprehensive experiments exhibit that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with 7 existing approaches on 6 different model architectures across various datasets.

Abstract: Document layout understanding remains data-intensive despite advances in semi-supervised learning. We present a framework that enhances semi-supervised detection by fusing visual predictions with structural priors from text-pretrained LLMs via principled probabilistic weighting. Given unlabeled documents, an OCR-LLM pipeline infers hierarchical regions which are combined with teacher detector outputs through inverse-variance fusion to generate refined pseudo-labels.Our method demonstrates consistent gains across model scales. With a lightweight SwiftFormer backbone (26M params), we achieve 88.2$\pm$0.3 AP using only 5\% labels on PubLayNet. When applied to document-pretrained LayoutLMv3 (133M params), our fusion framework reaches 89.7$\pm$0.4 AP, surpassing both LayoutLMv3 with standard semi-supervised learning (89.1$\pm$0.4 AP, p=0.02) and matching UDOP~\cite{udop} (89.8 AP) which requires 100M+ pages of multimodal pretraining. This demonstrates that LLM structural priors are complementary to both lightweight and pretrained architectures. Key findings include: (1) learned instance-adaptive gating improves over fixed weights by +0.9 AP with data-dependent PAC bounds correctly predicting convergence; (2) open-source LLMs enable privacy-preserving deployment with minimal loss (Llama-3-70B: 87.1 AP lightweight, 89.4 AP with LayoutLMv3); (3) LLMs provide targeted semantic disambiguation (18.7\% of cases, +3.8 AP gain) beyond simple text heuristics.Total system cost includes \$12 for GPT-4o-mini API or 17 GPU-hours for local Llama-3-70B per 50K pages, amortized across training runs.

Abstract: Unsupervised remote sensing change detection aims to monitor and analyze changes from multi-temporal remote sensing images in the same geometric region at different times, without the need for labeled training data. Previous unsupervised methods attempt to achieve style transfer across multi-temporal remote sensing images through reconstruction by a generator network, and then capture the unreconstructable areas as the changed regions. However, it often leads to poor performance due to generator overfitting. In this paper, we propose a novel Consistency Change Detection Framework (CCDF) to address this challenge. Specifically, we introduce a Cycle Consistency (CC) module to reduce the overfitting issues in the generator-based reconstruction. Additionally, we propose a Semantic Consistency (SC) module to enable detail reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: While convolutional neural network (CNN)-based object detection is widely used, it exhibits a shape dependency that degrades performance for postures not included in the training data. Building upon our previous simulation study published in this journal, this study implements and evaluates the spectral-based approach on physical hardware to address this limitation. Specifically, this paper introduces HitoMi-Cam, a lightweight and shape-agnostic person detection method that uses the spectral reflectance properties of clothing. The author implemented the system on a resource-constrained edge device without a GPU to assess its practical viability. The results indicate that a processing speed of 23.2 frames per second (fps) (253x190 pixels) is achievable, suggesting that the method can be used for real-time applications. In a simulated search and rescue scenario where the performance of CNNs declines, HitoMi-Cam achieved an average precision (AP) of 93.5%, surpassing that of the compared CNN models (best AP of 53.8%). Throughout all evaluation scenarios, the occurrence of false positives remained minimal. This study positions the HitoMi-Cam method not as a replacement for CNN-based detectors but as a complementary tool under specific conditions. The results indicate that spectral-based person detection can be a viable option for real-time operation on edge devices in real-world environments where shapes are unpredictable, such as disaster rescue.

Abstract: Text-only training provides an attractive approach to address data scarcity challenges in zero-shot image captioning (ZIC), avoiding the expense of collecting paired image-text annotations. However, although these approaches perform well within training domains, they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization, often producing hallucinated content when encountering novel visual environments. Retrieval-based methods attempt to mitigate this limitation by leveraging external knowledge, but they can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination when retrieved captions contain entities irrelevant to the inputs. We introduce the concept of negative entities--objects that appear in generated caption but are absent from the input--and propose Negative Entity Suppression (NES) to tackle this challenge. NES seamlessly integrates three stages: (1) it employs synthetic images to ensure consistent image-to-text retrieval across both training and inference; (2) it filters negative entities from retrieved content to enhance accuracy; and (3) it applies attention-level suppression using identified negative entities to further minimize the impact of hallucination-prone features. Evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that NES maintains competitive in-domain performance while improving cross-domain transfer and reducing hallucination rates, achieving new state-of-the-art results in ZIC.

Abstract: Deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on edge devices (e.g., smartphones and robots) is crucial for enabling low-latency and privacy-preserving intelligent applications. Given the resource constraints of these devices, quantization offers a promising solution by improving memory efficiency and reducing bandwidth requirements, thereby facilitating the deployment of VLMs. However, existing research has rarely explored aggressive quantization on VLMs, particularly for the models ranging from 1B to 2B parameters, which are more suitable for resource-constrained edge devices. In this paper, we propose SPEED-Q, a novel Staged Processing with Enhanced Distillation framework for VLM low-bit weight-only quantization that systematically addresses the following two critical obstacles: (1) significant discrepancies in quantization sensitivity between vision (ViT) and language (LLM) components in VLMs; (2) training instability arising from the reduced numerical precision inherent in low-bit quantization. In SPEED-Q, a staged sensitivity adaptive mechanism is introduced to effectively harmonize performance across different modalities. We further propose a distillation-enhanced quantization strategy to stabilize the training process and reduce data dependence. Together, SPEED-Q enables accurate, stable, and data-efficient quantization of complex VLMs. SPEED-Q is the first framework tailored for quantizing entire small-scale billion-parameter VLMs to low bits. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SPEED-Q achieves up to 6x higher accuracy than existing quantization methods under 2-bit settings and consistently outperforms prior on-device VLMs under both 2-bit and 4-bit settings. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/antgroup/SPEED-Q.

Abstract: Human-machine collaborative compression has been receiving increasing research efforts for reducing image/video data, serving as the basis for both human perception and machine intelligence. Existing collaborative methods are dominantly built upon the de facto human-vision compression pipeline, witnessing deficiency on complexity and bit-rates when aggregating the machine-vision compression. Indeed, machine vision solely focuses on the core regions within the image/video, requiring much less information compared with the compressed information for human vision. In this paper, we thus set out the first successful attempt by a novel collaborative compression method based on the machine-vision-oriented compression, instead of human-vision pipeline. In other words, machine vision serves as the basis for human vision within collaborative compression. A plug-and-play variable bit-rate strategy is also developed for machine vision tasks. Then, we propose to progressively aggregate the semantics from the machine-vision compression, whilst seamlessly tailing the diffusion prior to restore high-fidelity details for human vision, thus named as diffusion-prior based feature compression for human and machine visions (Diff-FCHM). Experimental results verify the consistently superior performances of our Diff-FCHM, on both machine-vision and human-vision compression with remarkable margins. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出分层蒸馏（HD）框架，将轨迹蒸馏和分布蒸馏结合，先用轨迹蒸馏生成结构草图，再用分布蒸馏进行细节精炼，并引入自适应加权判别器（AWD）来提升单步扩散模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的推理延迟限制了其实时应用。现有的轨迹蒸馏和分布蒸馏方法存在权衡：轨迹蒸馏保留全局结构但损失高频细节，分布蒸馏保真度高但易出现模式崩溃和训练不稳定。

Method: 1. 分层蒸馏框架：先用轨迹蒸馏生成结构草图作为初始化，再用分布蒸馏进行精炼；2. 引入自适应加权判别器（AWD），通过动态分配token权重来关注局部缺陷，实现高效细节精炼。

Conclusion: 该方法为高保真单步扩散模型建立了稳健的新范式，在保持高质量的同时显著降低了推理延迟。

Abstract: The inference latency of diffusion models remains a critical barrier to their real-time application. While trajectory-based and distribution-based step distillation methods offer solutions, they present a fundamental trade-off. Trajectory-based methods preserve global structure but act as a "lossy compressor", sacrificing high-frequency details. Conversely, distribution-based methods can achieve higher fidelity but often suffer from mode collapse and unstable training. This paper recasts them from independent paradigms into synergistic components within our novel Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework. We leverage trajectory distillation not as a final generator, but to establish a structural ``sketch", providing a near-optimal initialization for the subsequent distribution-based refinement stage. This strategy yields an ideal initial distribution that enhances the ceiling of overall performance. To further improve quality, we introduce and refine the adversarial training process. We find standard discriminator structures are ineffective at refining an already high-quality generator. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD), tailored for the HD pipeline. By dynamically allocating token weights, AWD focuses on local imperfections, enabling efficient detail refinement. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks. On ImageNet $256\times256$, our single-step model achieves an FID of 2.26, rivaling its 250-step teacher. It also achieves promising results on the high-resolution text-to-image MJHQ benchmark, proving its generalizability. Our method establishes a robust new paradigm for high-fidelity, single-step diffusion models.

TL;DR: NAMEA是一种新颖的集成攻击方法，通过整合集成模型中非注意力区域的梯度来提升对抗样本在不同架构模型间的迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集成攻击在跨异构模型架构迁移时效果不佳，主要原因是异构代理模型的梯度更新方向差异很大，难以在充分利用个体模型的同时减少集成模型的梯度方差。

Method: 设计NAMEA集成攻击，首次将集成模型中非注意力区域的梯度整合到迭代梯度优化过程中。通过元学习方式分别合并注意力区域和非注意力区域的梯度，融合CNN和ViT的迁移信息。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上的实验表明，NAMEA比当前最先进的集成攻击AdaEA和SMER分别平均提升了15.0%和9.6%的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 这是首次探索集成非注意力在提升跨架构迁移性方面的能力，为发起集成攻击提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Ensemble attacks integrate the outputs of surrogate models with diverse architectures, which can be combined with various gradient-based attacks to improve adversarial transferability. However, previous work shows unsatisfactory attack performance when transferring across heterogeneous model architectures. The main reason is that the gradient update directions of heterogeneous surrogate models differ widely, making it hard to reduce the gradient variance of ensemble models while making the best of individual model. To tackle this challenge, we design a novel ensemble attack, NAMEA, which for the first time integrates the gradients from the non-attention areas of ensemble models into the iterative gradient optimization process. Our design is inspired by the observation that the attention areas of heterogeneous models vary sharply, thus the non-attention areas of ViTs are likely to be the focus of CNNs and vice versa. Therefore, we merge the gradients respectively from the attention and non-attention areas of ensemble models so as to fuse the transfer information of CNNs and ViTs. Specifically, we pioneer a new way of decoupling the gradients of non-attention areas from those of attention areas, while merging gradients by meta-learning. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet dataset indicate that NAMEA outperforms AdaEA and SMER, the state-of-the-art ensemble attacks by an average of 15.0% and 9.6%, respectively. This work is the first attempt to explore the power of ensemble non-attention in boosting cross-architecture transferability, providing new insights into launching ensemble attacks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的双向参考协调视频压缩方法BRHVC，通过双向运动收敛和双向上下文融合来优化双向参考帧的利用，在HEVC数据集上超越了现有神经视频压缩方法和传统编码VTM-RA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经B帧视频压缩相比P帧压缩研究不足，其分层编码可能导致连续时间预测复杂化，特别是在帧跨度较大的层次上，两个参考帧的贡献可能不平衡，需要优化参考信息利用。

Method: 提出BRHVC方法，包含双向运动收敛(BMC)和双向上下文融合(BCF)。BMC在运动压缩中收敛多个光流，实现更大尺度的精确运动补偿；BCF在运动补偿精度指导下显式建模参考上下文的权重。

Result: 实验结果表明BRHVC超越了之前最先进的神经视频压缩方法，甚至在HEVC数据集上超过了传统编码VTM-RA（随机访问配置）。

Conclusion: 通过更高效的运动和上下文处理，BRHVC能够有效协调双向参考，提升压缩性能。

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) has made significant progress in recent years, while neural B-frame video compression (NBVC) remains underexplored compared to P-frame compression. NBVC can adopt bi-directional reference frames for better compression performance. However, NBVC's hierarchical coding may complicate continuous temporal prediction, especially at some hierarchical levels with a large frame span, which could cause the contribution of the two reference frames to be unbalanced. To optimize reference information utilization, we propose a novel NBVC method, termed Bi-directional Reference Harmonization Video Compression (BRHVC), with the proposed Bi-directional Motion Converge (BMC) and Bi-directional Contextual Fusion (BCF). BMC converges multiple optical flows in motion compression, leading to more accurate motion compensation on a larger scale. Then BCF explicitly models the weights of reference contexts under the guidance of motion compensation accuracy. With more efficient motions and contexts, BRHVC can effectively harmonize bi-directional references. Experimental results indicate that our BRHVC outperforms previous state-of-the-art NVC methods, even surpassing the traditional coding, VTM-RA (under random access configuration), on the HEVC datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分形生成模型(FGM)能生成高质量图像，但其固有的自相似性限制了输出多样性。需要一种方法在保持视觉质量的同时增强生成结果的多样性。

Method: 1) 提出可学习的HD估计方法直接从图像嵌入预测HD；2) 采用基于HD的损失函数和单调动量驱动调度策略；3) 在推理阶段使用HD引导的拒绝采样选择几何结构更丰富的输出。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上的实验表明，FGM-HD框架相比原始FGM实现了39%的输出多样性提升，同时保持了相当的图像质量。

Conclusion: 这是首个将Hausdorff维度引入FGM的工作，有效增强了生成输出的多样性，并为FGM发展提供了理论贡献。

Abstract: Improving the diversity of generated results while maintaining high visual quality remains a significant challenge in image generation tasks. Fractal Generative Models (FGMs) are efficient in generating high-quality images, but their inherent self-similarity limits the diversity of output images. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on the Hausdorff Dimension (HD), a widely recognized concept in fractal geometry used to quantify structural complexity, which aids in enhancing the diversity of generated outputs. To incorporate HD into FGM, we propose a learnable HD estimation method that predicts HD directly from image embeddings, addressing computational cost concerns. However, simply introducing HD into a hybrid loss is insufficient to enhance diversity in FGMs due to: 1) degradation of image quality, and 2) limited improvement in generation diversity. To this end, during training, we adopt an HD-based loss with a monotonic momentum-driven scheduling strategy to progressively optimize the hyperparameters, obtaining optimal diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Moreover, during inference, we employ HD-guided rejection sampling to select geometrically richer outputs. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our FGM-HD framework yields a 39\% improvement in output diversity compared to vanilla FGMs, while preserving comparable image quality. To our knowledge, this is the very first work introducing HD into FGM. Our method effectively enhances the diversity of generated outputs while offering a principled theoretical contribution to FGM development.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AuthSig是一个基于生成模型和水印的静态电子签名框架，通过风格嵌入隐式编码水印信息，实现"一次签名，一次使用"策略，解决了静态签名易被复制和重用的安全问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无纸化工作流程的普及，静态扫描签名因其便利性仍然广泛使用，但这些签名几乎失去了认证属性，无法可靠验证且易受恶意复制和重用攻击。

Method: 利用人类视觉系统对细微风格变化不敏感的特性，在生成过程中精细调节风格嵌入来隐式编码水印位；引入关键点驱动的数据增强策略来增强风格多样性，支持鲁棒的水印嵌入。

Result: 实验结果显示，AuthSig在数字域失真和签名特定退化下提取准确率超过98%，在打印扫描场景下仍保持有效。

Conclusion: AuthSig框架成功地将认证信息绑定到签名图像中，为静态电子签名提供了可靠的安全保障。

Abstract: With the deepening trend of paperless workflows, signatures as a means of identity authentication are gradually shifting from traditional ink-on-paper to electronic formats.Despite the availability of dynamic pressure-sensitive and PKI-based digital signatures, static scanned signatures remain prevalent in practice due to their convenience. However, these static images, having almost lost their authentication attributes, cannot be reliably verified and are vulnerable to malicious copying and reuse. To address these issues, we propose AuthSig, a novel static electronic signature framework based on generative models and watermark, which binds authentication information to the signature image. Leveraging the human visual system's insensitivity to subtle style variations, AuthSig finely modulates style embeddings during generation to implicitly encode watermark bits-enforcing a One Signature, One Use policy.To overcome the scarcity of handwritten signature data and the limitations of traditional augmentation methods, we introduce a keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy that effectively enhances style diversity to support robust watermark embedding. Experimental results show that AuthSig achieves over 98% extraction accuracy under both digital-domain distortions and signature-specific degradations, and remains effective even in print-scan scenarios.

Result: 实验结果表明，相比现有策略，该方法显著提升了ICL性能

Conclusion: CoDR为演示选择提供了既有效又高效的鲁棒解决方案

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs), enabling them to leverage a few examples directly from input contexts. However, the effectiveness of this approach is heavily reliant on the selection of demonstrations, a process that is NP-hard. Traditional strategies, including random, similarity-based sampling and infoscore-based sampling, often lead to inefficiencies or suboptimal performance, struggling to balance both efficiency and effectiveness in demonstration selection. In this paper, we propose a novel demonstration selection framework named Coreset-based Dual Retrieval (CoDR). We show that samples within a diverse subset achieve a higher expected mutual information. To implement this, we introduce a cluster-pruning method to construct a diverse coreset that aligns more effectively with the query while maintaining diversity. Additionally, we develop a dual retrieval mechanism that enhances the selection process by achieving global demonstration selection while preserving efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the ICL performance compared to the existing strategies, providing a robust solution for effective and efficient demonstration selection.

Motivation: 微动脉瘤是糖尿病视网膜病变的最早病理标志，但人工筛查劳动密集且易出错。现有基于扩散的异常检测方法存在身份映射、难以区分微动脉瘤与其他异常、正常特征重建差三大问题，阻碍临床应用。

Conclusion: WDT-MD框架显著提升了微动脉瘤检测性能，对改善早期糖尿病视网膜病变筛查具有重要应用前景。

Abstract: Microaneurysms (MAs), the earliest pathognomonic signs of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), present as sub-60 $μm$ lesions in fundus images with highly variable photometric and morphological characteristics, rendering manual screening not only labor-intensive but inherently error-prone. While diffusion-based anomaly detection has emerged as a promising approach for automated MA screening, its clinical application is hindered by three fundamental limitations. First, these models often fall prey to "identity mapping", where they inadvertently replicate the input image. Second, they struggle to distinguish MAs from other anomalies, leading to high false positives. Third, their suboptimal reconstruction of normal features hampers overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Wavelet Diffusion Transformer framework for MA Detection (WDT-MD), which features three key innovations: a noise-encoded image conditioning mechanism to avoid "identity mapping" by perturbing image conditions during training; pseudo-normal pattern synthesis via inpainting to introduce pixel-level supervision, enabling discrimination between MAs and other anomalies; and a wavelet diffusion Transformer architecture that combines the global modeling capability of diffusion Transformers with multi-scale wavelet analysis to enhance reconstruction of normal retinal features. Comprehensive experiments on the IDRiD and e-ophtha MA datasets demonstrate that WDT-MD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pixel-level and image-level MA detection. This advancement holds significant promise for improving early DR screening.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a core task in image processing, yet many methods degrade when images are heavily corrupted by noise and exhibit intensity inhomogeneity. Within the iterative-convolution thresholding method (ICTM) framework, we propose a variational segmentation model that integrates denoising terms. Specifically, the denoising component consists of an I-divergence term and an adaptive total-variation (TV) regularizer, making the model well suited to images contaminated by Gamma--distributed multiplicative noise and Poisson noise. A spatially adaptive weight derived from a gray-level indicator guides diffusion differently across regions of varying intensity. To further address intensity inhomogeneity, we estimate a smoothly varying bias field, which improves segmentation accuracy. Regions are represented by characteristic functions, with contour length encoded accordingly. For efficient optimization, we couple ICTM with a relaxed modified scalar auxiliary variable (RMSAV) scheme. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world images with intensity inhomogeneity and diverse noise types show that the proposed model achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared with competing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前开放集目标检测器仅依赖基于文本描述或视觉示例的正向提示，在面对视觉相似但语义不同的干扰物时表现脆弱。

Method: 提出统一视觉提示编码器联合处理正负视觉提示，训练免费的负向否定计算模块动态抑制负响应，以及负向否定铰链损失增强正负嵌入的判别性边界。

Result: 在零样本检测中表现出色，显著缩小了视觉提示与文本提示方法之间的性能差距，在长尾场景中表现尤为突出（LVIS-minival上51.2 AP_r）。

Conclusion: 负向提示是推进开放集视觉识别系统的关键新维度。

Abstract: Object detection methods have evolved from closed-set to open-set paradigms over the years. Current open-set object detectors, however, remain constrained by their exclusive reliance on positive indicators based on given prompts like text descriptions or visual exemplars. This positive-only paradigm experiences consistent vulnerability to visually similar but semantically different distractors. We propose T-Rex-Omni, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating negative visual prompts to negate hard negative distractors. Specifically, we first introduce a unified visual prompt encoder that jointly processes positive and negative visual prompts. Next, a training-free Negating Negative Computing (NNC) module is proposed to dynamically suppress negative responses during the probability computing stage. To further boost performance through fine-tuning, our Negating Negative Hinge (NNH) loss enforces discriminative margins between positive and negative embeddings. T-Rex-Omni supports flexible deployment in both positive-only and joint positive-negative inference modes, accommodating either user-specified or automatically generated negative examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable zero-shot detection performance, significantly narrowing the performance gap between visual-prompted and text-prompted methods while showing particular strength in long-tailed scenarios (51.2 AP_r on LVIS-minival). This work establishes negative prompts as a crucial new dimension for advancing open-set visual recognition systems.

Result: 在POPE和CHAIR基准测试中，Owl显著减少了幻觉，在保持忠实度的同时实现了新的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: Owl通过因果建模和注意力重加权有效缓解了物体幻觉问题，同时保持了视觉语言理解能力。

Abstract: Object hallucination remains a critical challenge in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where models generate content inconsistent with visual inputs. Existing language-decoder based mitigation approaches often regulate visual or textual attention independently, overlooking their interaction as two key causal factors. To address this, we propose Owl (Bi-mOdal attention reWeighting for Layer-wise hallucination mitigation), a causally-grounded framework that models hallucination process via a structural causal graph, treating decomposed visual and textual attentions as mediators. We introduce VTACR (Visual-to-Textual Attention Contribution Ratio), a novel metric that quantifies the modality contribution imbalance during decoding. Our analysis reveals that hallucinations frequently occur in low-VTACR scenarios, where textual priors dominate and visual grounding is weakened. To mitigate this, we design a fine-grained attention intervention mechanism that dynamically adjusts token- and layer-wise attention guided by VTACR signals. Finally, we propose a dual-path contrastive decoding strategy: one path emphasizes visually grounded predictions, while the other amplifies hallucinated ones -- letting visual truth shine and hallucination collapse. Experimental results on the POPE and CHAIR benchmarks show that Owl achieves significant hallucination reduction, setting a new SOTA in faithfulness while preserving vision-language understanding capability.

Conclusion: USF-Net通过创新的自适应大核卷积和低复杂度注意力机制，有效解决了云图像序列外推的关键挑战，同时发布了ASI-CIS数据集促进该领域研究。

Abstract: Ground-based remote sensing cloud image sequence extrapolation is a key research area in the development of photovoltaic power systems. However, existing approaches exhibit several limitations:(1)they primarily rely on static kernels to augment feature information, lacking adaptive mechanisms to extract features at varying resolutions dynamically;(2)temporal guidance is insufficient, leading to suboptimal modeling of long-range spatiotemporal dependencies; and(3)the quadratic computational cost of attention mechanisms is often overlooked, limiting efficiency in practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose USF-Net, a Unified Spatiotemporal Fusion Network that integrates adaptive large-kernel convolutions and a low-complexity attention mechanism, combining temporal flow information within an encoder-decoder framework. Specifically, the encoder employs three basic layers to extract features. Followed by the USTM, which comprises:(1)a SiB equipped with a SSM that dynamically captures multi-scale contextual information, and(2)a TiB featuring a TAM that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. In addition, a DSM with a TGM is introduced to enable unified modeling of temporally guided spatiotemporal dependencies. On the decoder side, a DUM is employed to address the common "ghosting effect." It utilizes the initial temporal state as an attention operator to preserve critical motion signatures. As a key contribution, we also introduce and release the ASI-CIS dataset. Extensive experiments on ASI-CIS demonstrate that USF-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a superior balance between prediction accuracy and computational efficiency for ground-based cloud extrapolation.

Abstract: Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) image dehazing faces challenges such as limited scene adaptability in prior-based methods and high computational complexity with color distortion in deep learning approaches. To address these issues, we propose 4KDehazeFlow, a novel method based on Flow Matching and the Haze-Aware vector field. This method models the dehazing process as a progressive optimization of continuous vector field flow, providing efficient data-driven adaptive nonlinear color transformation for high-quality dehazing. Specifically, our method has the following advantages: 1) 4KDehazeFlow is a general method compatible with various deep learning networks, without relying on any specific network architecture. 2) We propose a learnable 3D lookup table (LUT) that encodes haze transformation parameters into a compact 3D mapping matrix, enabling efficient inference through precomputed mappings. 3) We utilize a fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver to stably solve the dehazing flow field through an accurate step-by-step iterative method, effectively suppressing artifacts. Extensive experiments show that 4KDehazeFlow exceeds seven state-of-the-art methods. It delivers a 2dB PSNR increase and better performance in dense haze and color fidelity.

TL;DR: PAN是一个通用的、可交互的、长视野的世界模型，通过高质量视频模拟预测未来世界状态，结合了基于LLM的自回归潜在动态主干和视频扩散解码器，实现潜在空间推理与世界动态的统一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型缺乏因果控制、交互性和长视野一致性，而现有世界模型往往局限于特定领域且泛化能力有限。需要构建一个能够跨领域泛化、支持自然语言动作控制、具有长视野一致性的通用世界模型。

Method: 采用生成潜在预测(GLP)架构：基于大语言模型的自回归潜在动态主干，结合视频扩散解码器。在大型视频-动作对数据集上训练，支持开放领域、动作条件化的模拟。

Result: 实验表明PAN在动作条件化世界模拟、长视野预测和模拟推理方面表现优异，优于其他视频生成器和世界模型。

Conclusion: PAN朝着通用世界模型迈出了一步，能够为推理和行动提供未来世界状态的预测性模拟。

Abstract: A world model enables an intelligent agent to imagine, predict, and reason about how the world evolves in response to its actions, and accordingly to plan and strategize. While recent video generation models produce realistic visual sequences, they typically operate in the prompt-to-full-video manner without causal control, interactivity, or long-horizon consistency required for purposeful reasoning. Existing world modeling efforts, on the other hand, often focus on restricted domains (e.g., physical, game, or 3D-scene dynamics) with limited depth and controllability, and struggle to generalize across diverse environments and interaction formats. In this work, we introduce PAN, a general, interactable, and long-horizon world model that predicts future world states through high-quality video simulation conditioned on history and natural language actions. PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics. Extensive experiments show that PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other video generators and world models, taking a step towards general world models that enable predictive simulation of future world states for reasoning and acting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VQA系统在处理文化特定内容时存在局限，因为文化知识在训练语料中代表性不足，且推理过程对用户不透明。

Method: 集成文化对象检测骨干网络和结构化程序生成层，构建包含答案预测和解释的紧密耦合流水线，使用越南文化实体知识库作为背景信息源，双模态解释模块结合基于注意力的视觉证据和结构化文本推理。

Result: 构建了越南文化VQA数据集，展示了基于编程的方法在文化AI中的实用性，系统提供了透明的解释，揭示计算原理和底层文化背景。

Conclusion: 该框架支持教育和文化保护，强调可解释性和文化敏感性，为文化AI提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Contemporary Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems remain constrained when confronted with culturally specific content, largely because cultural knowledge is under-represented in training corpora and the reasoning process is not rendered interpretable to end users. This paper introduces VietMEAgent, a multimodal explainable framework engineered for Vietnamese cultural understanding. The method integrates a cultural object detection backbone with a structured program generation layer, yielding a pipeline in which answer prediction and explanation are tightly coupled. A curated knowledge base of Vietnamese cultural entities serves as an explicit source of background information, while a dual-modality explanation module combines attention-based visual evidence with structured, human-readable textual rationales. We further construct a Vietnamese Cultural VQA dataset sourced from public repositories and use it to demonstrate the practicality of programming-based methodologies for cultural AI. The resulting system provides transparent explanations that disclose both the computational rationale and the underlying cultural context, supporting education and cultural preservation with an emphasis on interpretability and cultural sensitivity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTC方法仅基于对抗输入的梯度生成反攻击，搜索空间狭窄，容易过拟合有限的对抗模式，缺乏多样性来完全中和广泛的扰动

Method: 提出方向正交反攻击(DOC)，结合正交梯度方向和动量更新来扩展反攻击空间的探索，增加扰动多样性，同时基于平均余弦相似度提出方向敏感度评分来提升DOC性能

Result: 在16个数据集上的广泛实验表明，DOC在各种攻击下提高了对抗鲁棒性，同时保持了竞争力的干净准确率

Conclusion: 增强反攻击的多样性和覆盖范围对于提高测试时防御的对抗鲁棒性至关重要，DOC方法通过扩展搜索空间和增加扰动多样性，能够发现更具泛化性的反攻击

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training models (VLPs) demonstrate strong multimodal understanding and zero-shot generalization, yet remain vulnerable to adversarial examples, raising concerns about their reliability. Recent work, Test-Time Counterattack (TTC), improves robustness by generating perturbations that maximize the embedding deviation of adversarial inputs using PGD, pushing them away from their adversarial representations. However, due to the fundamental difference in optimization objectives between adversarial attacks and counterattacks, generating counterattacks solely based on gradients with respect to the adversarial input confines the search to a narrow space. As a result, the counterattacks could overfit limited adversarial patterns and lack the diversity to fully neutralize a broad range of perturbations. In this work, we argue that enhancing the diversity and coverage of counterattacks is crucial to improving adversarial robustness in test-time defense. Accordingly, we propose Directional Orthogonal Counterattack (DOC), which augments counterattack optimization by incorporating orthogonal gradient directions and momentum-based updates. This design expands the exploration of the counterattack space and increases the diversity of perturbations, which facilitates the discovery of more generalizable counterattacks and ultimately improves the ability to neutralize adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, we present a directional sensitivity score based on averaged cosine similarity to boost DOC by improving example discrimination and adaptively modulating the counterattack strength. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate that DOC improves adversarial robustness under various attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

Method: 提出了一个伪重放框架，利用视觉合成器合成已学习组合的视觉表示，以及语言原语蒸馏机制来在学习过程中保持对齐的原语表示。

Result: 在构建的MIT-States-CompIL和C-GQA-CompIL基准上进行了广泛实验，证明了所提框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该工作为组合增量学习提供了新的解决方案，能够有效应对现实世界中不断涌现的组合数据。

Abstract: Compositional generalization has achieved substantial progress in computer vision on pre-collected training data. Nonetheless, real-world data continually emerges, with possible compositions being nearly infinite, long-tailed, and not entirely visible. Thus, an ideal model is supposed to gradually improve the capability of compositional generalization in an incremental manner. In this paper, we explore Composition-Incremental Learning for Compositional Generalization (CompIL) in the context of the compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) task, where models need to continually learn new compositions, intending to improve their compositional generalization capability progressively. To quantitatively evaluate CompIL, we develop a benchmark construction pipeline leveraging existing datasets, yielding MIT-States-CompIL and C-GQA-CompIL. Furthermore, we propose a pseudo-replay framework utilizing a visual synthesizer to synthesize visual representations of learned compositions and a linguistic primitive distillation mechanism to maintain aligned primitive representations across the learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

*Byunghyun Kim*

TL;DR: UL-TTA是一种无需训练和反向传播的测试时适应框架，通过在线EM风格程序仅调整logit级别的参数（类别原型、先验概率和温度），在领域偏移下显著提升CLIP等视觉语言模型的准确性和校准性，同时保持低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时适应方法需要反向传播、协方差估计或大量内存，不适合流式和边缘场景。视觉语言模型在领域偏移下存在特征漂移、类别先验不匹配和严重校准错误的问题。

Method: 冻结主干网络，仅在线调整logit级参数：使用选择性样本过滤、闭式贝叶斯更新原型和先验、解耦预测与校准温度、轻量防护机制防止长期漂移。

Result: 在多个大规模跨域和OOD基准测试中，UL-TTA平均比零样本CLIP提升4.7个百分点准确率，同时降低ECE 20-30%，延迟开销小于8%，在长达20万样本的流式测试中无崩溃。

Conclusion: 仅通过logit级别的贝叶斯适应即可在领域偏移下为视觉语言模型获得最先进的准确率-校准权衡，无需更新任何主干网络参数。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot recognition by comparing image embeddings to text-derived class prototypes. However, under domain shift, they suffer from feature drift, class-prior mismatch, and severe miscalibration. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often require backpropagation through large backbones, covariance estimation, or heavy memory/state, which is problematic for streaming and edge scenarios. We propose Ultra-Light Test-Time Adaptation (UL-TTA), a fully training-free and backprop-free framework that freezes the backbone and adapts only logit-level parameters: class prototypes, class priors, and temperature. UL-TTA performs an online EM-style procedure with (i) selective sample filtering to use only confident predictions, (ii) closed-form Bayesian updates for prototypes and priors anchored by text and Dirichlet priors, (iii) decoupled temperatures for prediction vs. calibration, and (iv) lightweight guards (norm clipping, prior KL constraints, smoothed temperature) to prevent drift in long streams. Across large-scale cross-domain and OOD benchmarks (PACS, Office-Home, DomainNet, Terra Incognita, ImageNet-R/A/V2/Sketch; ~726K test samples) and strong TTA baselines including Tent, T3A, CoTTA, SAR, Tip-Adapter, and FreeTTA, UL-TTA consistently improves top-1 accuracy (e.g., +4.7 points over zero-shot CLIP on average) while reducing ECE by 20-30%, with less than 8% latency overhead. Long-stream experiments up to 200K samples show no collapse. Our results demonstrate that logit-level Bayesian adaptation is sufficient to obtain state-of-the-art accuracy-calibration trade-offs for VLMs under domain shift, without updating any backbone parameters.

Motivation: 现有的Kuzushiji OCR方法在干净的文档上表现良好，但无法有效处理文档退化和印章等噪声，且缺乏专门针对这些挑战的数据集。

Method: 构建了DKDS数据集，定义了文本和印章检测、文档二值化两个基准任务。文本检测使用YOLO模型，文档二值化使用传统算法、K-means聚类和GAN方法。

Conclusion: DKDS数据集填补了Kuzushiji文档处理中噪声挑战的空白，为相关研究提供了新的基准和基线方法。

Abstract: Kuzushiji, a pre-modern Japanese cursive script, can currently be read and understood by only a few thousand trained experts in Japan. With the rapid development of deep learning, researchers have begun applying Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to transcribe Kuzushiji into modern Japanese. Although existing OCR methods perform well on clean pre-modern Japanese documents written in Kuzushiji, they often fail to consider various types of noise, such as document degradation and seals, which significantly affect recognition accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset specifically addresses these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Degraded Kuzushiji Documents with Seals (DKDS) dataset as a new benchmark for related tasks. We describe the dataset construction process, which required the assistance of a trained Kuzushiji expert, and define two benchmark tracks: (1) text and seal detection and (2) document binarization. For the text and seal detection track, we provide baseline results using multiple versions of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) models for detecting Kuzushiji characters and seals. For the document binarization track, we present baseline results from traditional binarization algorithms, traditional algorithms combined with K-means clustering, and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based methods. The DKDS dataset and the implementation code for baseline methods are available at https://ruiyangju.github.io/DKDS.

Conclusion: PIFF为洪水预测和响应提供了一个有效的数据驱动替代方案，结合物理约束和数据驱动学习，能够捕捉降雨、地形与洪水之间的因果关系。

Abstract: Flood mapping is crucial for assessing and mitigating flood impacts, yet traditional methods like numerical modeling and aerial photography face limitations in efficiency and reliability. To address these challenges, we propose PIFF, a physics-informed, flow-based generative neural network for near real-time flood depth estimation. Built on an image-to-image generative framework, it efficiently maps Digital Elevation Models (DEM) to flood depth predictions. The model is conditioned on a simplified inundation model (SPM) that embeds hydrodynamic priors into the training process. Additionally, a transformer-based rainfall encoder captures temporal dependencies in precipitation. Integrating physics-informed constraints with data-driven learning, PIFF captures the causal relationships between rainfall, topography, SPM, and flooding, replacing costly simulations with accurate, real-time flood maps. Using a 26 km study area in Tainan, Taiwan, with 182 rainfall scenarios ranging from 24 mm to 720 mm over 24 hours, our results demonstrate that PIFF offers an effective, data-driven alternative for flood prediction and response.

Conclusion: MACEval为大模型评估开辟了新的方向，提供了可持续、纵向量化的评估方法。

Abstract: Hundreds of benchmarks dedicated to evaluating large models from multiple perspectives have been presented over the past few years. Albeit substantial efforts, most of them remain closed-ended and are prone to overfitting due to the potential data contamination in the ever-growing training corpus of large models, thereby undermining the credibility of the evaluation. Moreover, the increasing scale and scope of current benchmarks with transient metrics, as well as the heavily human-dependent curation procedure, pose significant challenges for timely maintenance and adaptation to gauge the advancing capabilities of large models. In this paper, we introduce MACEval, a \Multi-Agent Continual Evaluation network for dynamic evaluation of large models, and define a new set of metrics to quantify performance longitudinally and sustainably. MACEval adopts an interactive and autonomous evaluation mode that employs role assignment, in-process data generation, and evaluation routing through a cascaded agent network. Extensive experiments on 9 open-ended tasks with 23 participating large models demonstrate that MACEval is (1) human-free and automatic, mitigating laborious result processing with inter-agent judgment guided; (2) efficient and economical, reducing a considerable amount of data and overhead to obtain similar results compared to related benchmarks; and (3) flexible and scalable, migrating or integrating existing benchmarks via customized evaluation topologies. We hope that MACEval can broaden future directions of large model evaluation.

Conclusion: 展示了触觉垫在普遍、保护隐私的多人动作识别方面的潜力。

Abstract: Multi-person global human mesh recovery (HMR) is crucial for understanding crowd dynamics and interactions. Traditional vision-based HMR methods sometimes face limitations in real-world scenarios due to mutual occlusions, insufficient lighting, and privacy concerns. Human-floor tactile interactions offer an occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternative for capturing human motion. Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios. However, when multiple individuals walk randomly on the mat simultaneously, how to distinguish intermingled pressure signals generated by different persons and subsequently acquire individual temporal pressure data remains a pending challenge for extending pressure-based HMR to the multi-person situation. In this paper, we present \textbf{PressTrack-HMR}, a top-down pipeline that recovers multi-person global human meshes solely from pressure signals. This pipeline leverages a tracking-by-detection strategy to first identify and segment each individual's pressure signal from the raw pressure data, and subsequently performs HMR for each extracted individual signal. Furthermore, we build a multi-person interaction pressure dataset \textbf{MIP}, which facilitates further research into pressure-based human motion analysis in multi-person scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in multi-person HMR using pressure data, with 89.2~$mm$ MPJPE and 112.6~$mm$ WA-MPJPE$_{100}$, and these showcase the potential of tactile mats for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving multi-person action recognition.

Abstract: This article presents HOTFLoc++, an end-to-end framework for LiDAR place recognition, re-ranking, and 6-DoF metric localisation in forests. Leveraging an octree-based transformer, our approach extracts hierarchical local descriptors at multiple granularities to increase robustness to clutter, self-similarity, and viewpoint changes in challenging scenarios, including ground-to-ground and ground-to-aerial in forest and urban environments. We propose a learnable multi-scale geometric verification module to reduce re-ranking failures in the presence of degraded single-scale correspondences. Our coarse-to-fine registration approach achieves comparable or lower localisation errors to baselines, with runtime improvements of two orders of magnitude over RANSAC for dense point clouds. Experimental results on public datasets show the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average Recall@1 of 90.7% on CS-Wild-Places: an improvement of 29.6 percentage points over baselines, while maintaining high performance on single-source benchmarks with an average Recall@1 of 91.7% and 96.0% on Wild-Places and MulRan, respectively. Our method achieves under 2 m and 5 degrees error for 97.2% of 6-DoF registration attempts, with our multi-scale re-ranking module reducing localisation errors by ~2$\times$ on average. The code will be available upon acceptance.

Motivation: AI生成视频技术快速发展，对内容安全和取证分析构成严重挑战。现有检测器主要依赖像素级视觉线索，对未见过的生成器泛化能力差。

Method: 提出DBINDS检测器，通过扩散模型反演分析潜在空间动态，发现真实视频和生成视频的初始噪声序列存在系统性差异。构建初始噪声差异序列(INDS)，提取多领域多尺度特征，结合特征优化和贝叶斯搜索调优的LightGBM分类器。

Conclusion: 基于扩散模型反演的潜在空间动态分析为AI生成视频检测提供了有效方法，能够克服现有像素级检测器的泛化限制。

Abstract: AI-generated video has advanced rapidly and poses serious challenges to content security and forensic analysis. Existing detectors rely mainly on pixel-level visual cues and generalize poorly to unseen generators. We propose DBINDS, a diffusion-model-inversion based detector that analyzes latent-space dynamics rather than pixels. We find that initial noise sequences recovered by diffusion inversion differ systematically between real and generated videos. Building on this, DBINDS forms an Initial Noise Difference Sequence (INDS) and extracts multi-domain, multi-scale features. With feature optimization and a LightGBM classifier tuned by Bayesian search, DBINDS (trained on a single generator) achieves strong cross-generator performance on GenVidBench, demonstrating good generalization and robustness in limited-data settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型越来越多地用于从图像直接生成皮肤病诊断叙述，但可靠的评估仍然是临床部署的主要瓶颈。

Method: 构建DermBench基准数据集（4000张真实皮肤病图像+专家认证诊断叙述），并使用LLM评估器评分；训练DermEval无参考多模态评估器，基于图像和生成叙述进行结构化评价。

Result: 在4500个病例的多样化数据集上实验显示，DermBench和DermEval与专家评分高度一致，平均偏差分别为0.251和0.117（满分5分）。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了可靠的多模态LLM诊断能力和可信度测量，支持临床有意义的、可重复和可扩展的评估。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate dermatology diagnostic narratives directly from images. However, reliable evaluation remains the primary bottleneck for responsible clinical deployment. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines DermBench, a meticulously curated benchmark, with DermEval, a robust automatic evaluator, to enable clinically meaningful, reproducible, and scalable assessment. We build DermBench, which pairs 4,000 real-world dermatology images with expert-certified diagnostic narratives and uses an LLM-based judge to score candidate narratives across clinically grounded dimensions, enabling consistent and comprehensive evaluation of multimodal models. For individual case assessment, we train DermEval, a reference-free multimodal evaluator. Given an image and a generated narrative, DermEval produces a structured critique along with an overall score and per-dimension ratings. This capability enables fine-grained, per-case analysis, which is critical for identifying model limitations and biases. Experiments on a diverse dataset of 4,500 cases demonstrate that DermBench and DermEval achieve close alignment with expert ratings, with mean deviations of 0.251 and 0.117 (out of 5), respectively, providing reliable measurement of diagnostic ability and trustworthiness across different multimodal LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型经常出现幻觉问题，特别是在对象存在性、属性和关系方面的错误，这影响了模型的可靠性。

Method: TACO将回答分解为原子查询，通过改写减少对措辞的敏感性，使用自一致性（黑盒）或自置信度（灰盒）聚合来估计置信度，最后用语言模型优化答案。

Result: 在五个基准测试（POPE、MME、HallusionBench、AMBER和MM-Hal Bench）上使用两个MLLM（LLaVA-1.5-7B和CogVLM2）的实验表明，TACO始终优于直接提示和视觉对比解码，减少了系统性偏差，改善了置信度校准。

Conclusion: TACO框架有效提升了多模态大语言模型的忠实度，证明了其在减轻幻觉方面的有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often suffer from hallucinations, particularly errors in object existence, attributes, or relations, which undermine their reliability. We introduce TACO (Verified Atomic Confidence Estimation), a simple framework that mitigates hallucinations through self-verification and confidence calibration without relying on external vision experts. TACO decomposes responses into atomic queries, paraphrases them to reduce sensitivity to wording, and estimates confidence using self-consistency (black-box) or self-confidence (gray-box) aggregation, before refining answers with a language model. Experiments on five benchmarks (POPE, MME, HallusionBench, AMBER, and MM-Hal Bench) with two MLLMs (\texttt{LLaVA-1.5-7B} and \texttt{CogVLM2}) show that TACO consistently outperforms direct prompting and Visual Contrastive Decoding, reduces systematic biases, and improves confidence calibration, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the faithfulness of MLLMs.

*Kaixiang Shu,Kai Meng,Junqin Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了空间信息瓶颈（S-IB）框架，从信息论角度理解梯度归因，通过优化反向传播中的向量-雅可比乘积的空间结构，实现特征的空间解纠缠，提升模型解释性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络通常学习空间纠缠的表示，将判别性前景特征与虚假背景相关性混在一起，这削弱了模型的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Method: 从信息论角度提出编码-解码视角：前向传播将输入编码到类别空间，反向传播中的VJP将此编码解码回特征空间。提出空间信息瓶颈（S-IB），通过最大化前景VJP与输入的互信息，同时最小化背景区域的互信息，鼓励网络仅在类别相关空间区域编码信息。

Result: 在五个基准测试上的实验表明，六种解释方法都获得了普遍改进，实现了更好的前景集中和背景抑制，无需方法特定调优，同时保持了分类准确性的持续提升。

Conclusion: 直接优化训练过程中VJP的空间结构可以改善多种解释范式的可视化质量，为梯度归因提供了新的信息论理解框架。

Abstract: Deep neural networks typically learn spatially entangled representations that conflate discriminative foreground features with spurious background correlations, thereby undermining model interpretability and robustness. We propose a novel understanding framework for gradient-based attribution from an information-theoretic perspective. We prove that, under mild conditions, the Vector-Jacobian Products (VJP) computed during backpropagation form minimal sufficient statistics of input features with respect to class labels. Motivated by this finding, we propose an encoding-decoding perspective : forward propagation encodes inputs into class space, while VJP in backpropagation decodes this encoding back to feature space. Therefore, we propose Spatial Information Bottleneck (S-IB) to spatially disentangle information flow. By maximizing mutual information between foreground VJP and inputs while minimizing mutual information in background regions, S-IB encourages networks to encode information only in class-relevant spatial regions. Since post-hoc explanation methods fundamentally derive from VJP computations, directly optimizing VJP's spatial structure during training improves visualization quality across diverse explanation paradigms. Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate universal improvements across six explanation methods, achieving better foreground concentration and background suppression without method-specific tuning, alongside consistent classification accuracy gains.

Abstract: The Animation-based Generative Codec (AGC) is an emerging paradigm for talking-face video compression. However, deploying its intricate decoder on resource and power-constrained edge devices presents challenges due to numerous parameters, the inflexibility to adapt to dynamically evolving algorithms, and the high power consumption induced by extensive computations and data transmission. This paper for the first time proposes a novel field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)-oriented AGC deployment scheme for edge-computing video services. Initially, we analyze the AGC algorithm and employ network compression methods including post-training static quantization and layer fusion techniques. Subsequently, we design an overlapped accelerator utilizing the co-processor paradigm to perform computations through software-hardware co-design. The hardware processing unit comprises engines such as convolution, grid sampling, upsample, etc. Parallelization optimization strategies like double-buffered pipelines and loop unrolling are employed to fully exploit the resources of FPGA. Ultimately, we establish an AGC FPGA prototype on the PYNQ-Z1 platform using the proposed scheme, achieving \textbf{24.9$\times$} and \textbf{4.1$\times$} higher energy efficiency against commercial Central Processing Unit (CPU) and Graphic Processing Unit (GPU), respectively. Specifically, only \textbf{11.7} microjoules ($\upmu$J) are required for one pixel reconstructed by this FPGA system.

Result: Transformer模型在所有活动中表现最佳（RMSE 0.87 W/kg），分钟通气量是最具预测性的单信号。低强度活动估计更准确（RMSE低至0.29 W/kg），高强度活动误差较大但标准化误差相当。个体间存在显著变异性。

Conclusion: 需要采用自适应建模策略来处理个体间变异性，分钟通气量是能量消耗估计的关键信号，Transformer架构在复杂信号处理中表现优异。

Abstract: Energy expenditure estimation aims to infer human metabolic rate from physiological signals such as heart rate, respiration, or accelerometer data, and has been studied primarily with classical regression methods. The few existing deep learning approaches rarely disentangle the role of neural architecture from that of signal choice. In this work, we systematically evaluate both aspects. We compare classical baselines with newer neural architectures across single signals, signal pairs, and grouped sensor inputs for diverse physical activities. Our results show that minute ventilation is the most predictive individual signal, with a transformer model achieving the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.87 W/kg across all activities. Paired and grouped signals, such as those from the Hexoskin smart shirt (five signals), offer good alternatives for faster models like CNN and ResNet with attention. Per-activity evaluation revealed mixed outcomes: notably better results in low-intensity activities (RMSE down to 0.29 W/kg; NRMSE = 0.04), while higher-intensity tasks showed larger RMSE but more comparable normalized errors. Finally, subject-level analysis highlights strong inter-individual variability, motivating the need for adaptive modeling strategies. Our code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/Sarvibabakhani/deeplearning-biosignals-ee .

Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法主要依赖单模态视觉信息，缺乏知识多样性，忽略了跨模态表示的潜力。本文探索将CLIP的视觉-语言知识作为知识蒸馏的补充监督源。

Method: 提出简单有效的框架，将传统教师的logits和特征与CLIP的logits和特征融合，结合CLIP的多提示文本指导，捕捉数据集特定和语义丰富的视觉线索。

Result: 融合CLIP的监督产生更自信可靠的预测，显著增加自信正确案例，减少自信错误案例。同时改进整个logit分布，产生对非目标类别的语义有意义概率，提高类间一致性和蒸馏质量。

Conclusion: 尽管方法简单，RichKD在多个基准测试中持续优于现有基线，并在分布偏移和输入损坏下表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multi-teacher knowledge distillation (KD), a more effective technique than traditional single-teacher methods, transfers knowledge from expert teachers to a compact student model using logit or feature matching. However, most existing approaches lack knowledge diversity, as they rely solely on unimodal visual information, overlooking the potential of cross-modal representations. In this work, we explore the use of CLIP's vision-language knowledge as a complementary source of supervision for KD, an area that remains largely underexplored. We propose a simple yet effective framework that fuses the logits and features of a conventional teacher with those from CLIP. By incorporating CLIP's multi-prompt textual guidance, the fused supervision captures both dataset-specific and semantically enriched visual cues. Beyond accuracy, analysis shows that the fused teacher yields more confident and reliable predictions, significantly increasing confident-correct cases while reducing confidently wrong ones. Moreover, fusion with CLIP refines the entire logit distribution, producing semantically meaningful probabilities for non-target classes, thereby improving inter-class consistency and distillation quality. Despite its simplicity, the proposed method, Enriching Knowledge Distillation (RichKD), consistently outperforms most existing baselines across multiple benchmarks and exhibits stronger robustness under distribution shifts and input corruptions.

Abstract: The rise of 3D generative models has enabled automatic 3D geometry and texture synthesis from multimodal inputs (e.g., text or images). However, these methods often ignore physical constraints and manufacturability considerations. In this work, we address the challenge of producing 3D designs that are both lightweight and self-supporting. We present DensiCrafter, a framework for generating lightweight, self-supporting 3D hollow structures by optimizing the density field. Starting from coarse voxel grids produced by Trellis, we interpret these as continuous density fields to optimize and introduce three differentiable, physically constrained, and simulation-free loss terms. Additionally, a mass regularization penalizes unnecessary material, while a restricted optimization domain preserves the outer surface. Our method seamlessly integrates with pretrained Trellis-based models (e.g., Trellis, DSO) without any architectural changes. In extensive evaluations, we achieve up to 43% reduction in material mass on the text-to-3D task. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method could improve the stability and maintain high geometric fidelity. Real-world 3D-printing experiments confirm that our hollow designs can be reliably fabricated and could be self-supporting.

Abstract: The teacher-student paradigm has emerged as a canonical framework in semi-supervised learning. When applied to medical image segmentation, the paradigm faces challenges due to inherent image ambiguities, making it particularly vulnerable to erroneous supervision. Crucially, the student's iterative reconfirmation of these errors leads to self-reinforcing bias. While some studies attempt to mitigate this bias, they often rely on external modifications to the conventional teacher-student framework, overlooking its intrinsic potential for error correction. In response, this work introduces a feedback mechanism into the teacher-student framework to counteract error reconfirmations. Here, the student provides feedback on the changes induced by the teacher's pseudo-labels, enabling the teacher to refine these labels accordingly. We specify that this interaction hinges on two key components: the feedback attributor, which designates pseudo-labels triggering the student's update, and the feedback receiver, which determines where to apply this feedback. Building on this, a dual-teacher feedback model is further proposed, which allows more dynamics in the feedback loop and fosters more gains by resolving disagreements through cross-teacher supervision while avoiding consistent errors. Comprehensive evaluations on three medical image benchmarks demonstrate the method's effectiveness in addressing error propagation in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Camera-based multi-view 3D detection is crucial for autonomous driving. PETR and its variants (PETRs) excel in benchmarks but face deployment challenges due to high computational cost and memory footprint. Quantization is an effective technique for compressing deep neural networks by reducing the bit width of weights and activations. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to PETRs leads to severe accuracy degradation. This issue primarily arises from two key challenges: (1) significant magnitude disparity between multi-modal features-specifically, image features and camera-ray positional embeddings (PE), and (2) the inefficiency and approximation error of quantizing non-linear operators, which commonly rely on hardware-unfriendly computations. In this paper, we propose FQ-PETR, a fully quantized framework for PETRs, featuring three key innovations: (1) Quantization-Friendly LiDAR-ray Position Embedding (QFPE): Replacing multi-point sampling with LiDAR-prior-guided single-point sampling and anchor-based embedding eliminates problematic non-linearities (e.g., inverse-sigmoid) and aligns PE scale with image features, preserving accuracy. (2) Dual-Lookup Table (DULUT): This algorithm approximates complex non-linear functions using two cascaded linear LUTs, achieving high fidelity with minimal entries and no specialized hardware. (3) Quantization After Numerical Stabilization (QANS): Performing quantization after softmax numerical stabilization mitigates attention distortion from large inputs. On PETRs (e.g. PETR, StreamPETR, PETRv2, MV2d), FQ-PETR under W8A8 achieves near-floating-point accuracy (1% degradation) while reducing latency by up to 75%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ and QAT baselines.

Motivation: 移动红外小目标检测在实际应用中至关重要，但由于目标特征弱和背景干扰复杂，仍然具有挑战性。现有方法中，时间差分能利用运动线索但空间特征提取有限，3D卷积能表示时空特征但缺乏对时间维度运动动态的显式感知。

Conclusion: TDCNet通过有效提取和增强时空特征，在复杂背景下显著提高了移动红外小目标的检测性能。

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection (IRSTD) plays a critical role in practical applications, such as surveillance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and UAV-based search system. Moving IRSTD still remains highly challenging due to weak target features and complex background interference. Accurate spatio-temporal feature modeling is crucial for moving target detection, typically achieved through either temporal differences or spatio-temporal (3D) convolutions. Temporal difference can explicitly leverage motion cues but exhibits limited capability in extracting spatial features, whereas 3D convolution effectively represents spatio-temporal features yet lacks explicit awareness of motion dynamics along the temporal dimension. In this paper, we propose a novel moving IRSTD network (TDCNet), which effectively extracts and enhances spatio-temporal features for accurate target detection. Specifically, we introduce a novel temporal difference convolution (TDC) re-parameterization module that comprises three parallel TDC blocks designed to capture contextual dependencies across different temporal ranges. Each TDC block fuses temporal difference and 3D convolution into a unified spatio-temporal convolution representation. This re-parameterized module can effectively capture multi-scale motion contextual features while suppressing pseudo-motion clutter in complex backgrounds, significantly improving detection performance. Moreover, we propose a TDC-guided spatio-temporal attention mechanism that performs cross-attention between the spatio-temporal features from the TDC-based backbone and a parallel 3D backbone. This mechanism models their global semantic dependencies to refine the current frame's features. Extensive experiments on IRSTD-UAV and public infrared datasets demonstrate that our TDCNet achieves state-of-the-art detection performance in moving target detection.

Abstract: Recognizing unseen skeleton action categories remains highly challenging due to the absence of corresponding skeletal priors. Existing approaches generally follow an "align-then-classify" paradigm but face two fundamental issues, i.e., (i) fragile point-to-point alignment arising from imperfect semantics, and (ii) rigid classifiers restricted by static decision boundaries and coarse-grained anchors. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for zero-shot skeleton action recognition, termed $\texttt{$\textbf{Flora}$}$, which builds upon $\textbf{F}$lexib$\textbf{L}$e neighb$\textbf{O}$r-aware semantic attunement and open-form dist$\textbf{R}$ibution-aware flow cl$\textbf{A}$ssifier. Specifically, we flexibly attune textual semantics by incorporating neighboring inter-class contextual cues to form direction-aware regional semantics, coupled with a cross-modal geometric consistency objective that ensures stable and robust point-to-region alignment. Furthermore, we employ noise-free flow matching to bridge the modality distribution gap between semantic and skeleton latent embeddings, while a condition-free contrastive regularization enhances discriminability, leading to a distribution-aware classifier with fine-grained decision boundaries achieved through token-level velocity predictions. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our method, showing particularly impressive performance even when trained with only 10\% of the seen data.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved state-of-the-art results for novel view synthesis. However, efficiently capturing high-fidelity reconstructions of specific objects within complex scenes remains a significant challenge. A key limitation of existing active reconstruction methods is their reliance on scene-level uncertainty metrics, which are often biased by irrelevant background clutter and lead to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks. We present OUGS, a novel framework that addresses this challenge with a more principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation for 3DGS. Our core innovation is to derive uncertainty directly from the explicit physical parameters of the 3D Gaussian primitives (e.g., position, scale, rotation). By propagating the covariance of these parameters through the rendering Jacobian, we establish a highly interpretable uncertainty model. This foundation allows us to then seamlessly integrate semantic segmentation masks to produce a targeted, object-aware uncertainty score that effectively disentangles the object from its environment. This allows for a more effective active view selection strategy that prioritizes views critical to improving object fidelity. Experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the 3DGS reconstruction process and achieves higher quality for targeted objects compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, while also serving as a robust uncertainty estimator for the global scene.

Abstract: Accurate intra-operative localization of the bronchoscope tip relative to patient anatomy remains challenging due to respiratory motion, anatomical variability, and CT-to-body divergence that cause deformation and misalignment between intra-operative views and pre-operative CT. Existing vision-based methods often fail to generalize across domains and patients, leading to residual alignment errors. This work establishes a generalizable foundation for bronchoscopy navigation through a robust vision-based framework and a new synthetic benchmark dataset that enables standardized and reproducible evaluation. We propose a vision-based pose optimization framework for frame-wise 2D-3D registration between intra-operative endoscopic views and pre-operative CT anatomy. A fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder enables direct similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, while a differentiable rendering module iteratively refines camera poses through depth consistency. To enhance reproducibility, we introduce the first public synthetic benchmark dataset for bronchoscopy navigation, addressing the lack of paired CT-endoscopy data. Trained exclusively on synthetic data distinct from the benchmark, our model achieves an average translational error of 2.65 mm and a rotational error of 0.19 rad, demonstrating accurate and stable localization. Qualitative results on real patient data further confirm strong cross-domain generalization, achieving consistent frame-wise 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation. Overall, the proposed framework achieves robust, domain-invariant localization through iterative vision-based optimization, while the new benchmark provides a foundation for standardized progress in vision-based bronchoscopy navigation.

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) plays a critical role in analyzing player behavior from videos, enabling performance evaluation. Current MOT methods are often evaluated using publicly available datasets. However, most of these focus on everyday scenarios such as pedestrian tracking or are tailored to specific sports, including soccer and basketball. Despite the inherent challenges of tracking players in American football, such as frequent occlusion and physical contact, no standardized dataset has been publicly available, making fair comparisons between methods difficult. To address this gap, we constructed the first dedicated detection and tracking dataset for the American football players and conducted a comparative evaluation of various detection and tracking methods. Our results demonstrate that accurate detection and tracking can be achieved even in crowded scenarios. Fine-tuning detection models improved performance over pre-trained models. Furthermore, when these fine-tuned detectors and re-identification models were integrated into tracking systems, we observed notable improvements in tracking accuracy compared to existing approaches. This work thus enables robust detection and tracking of American football players in challenging, high-density scenarios previously underserved by conventional methods.

Lightweight CNNs are more efficient but suffer from accuracy gaps. Cross-Architecture Knowledge Distillation (CAKD) addresses this by transferring knowledge from ViTs to CNNs, yet existing methods often struggle with architectural mismatch and overlook the value of stronger homogeneous CNN teachers. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation framework that leverages both a heterogeneous ViT teacher and a homogeneous CNN teacher to collaboratively guide a lightweight CNN student. We introduce two key components: (1) Discrepancy-Aware Teacher Weighting, which dynamically fuses the predictions from ViT and CNN teachers by assigning adaptive weights based on teacher confidence and prediction discrepancy with the student, enabling more informative and effective supervision; and (2) a Structure Discrepancy-Aware Distillation strategy, where the student learns the residual features between ViT and CNN teachers via a lightweight auxiliary branch, focusing on transferable architectural differences without mimicking all of ViT's high-dimensional patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including HMDB51, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, and Kinetics-400 demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation approaches, achieving notable performance improvements with a maximum accuracy gain of 5.95% on HMDB51.

*Jerrin Bright,Yuhao Chen,John S. Zelek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamPose3D是一个基于扩散模型的3D人体姿态估计框架，通过动作感知推理和时间想象来提升姿态估计的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D人体姿态估计方法主要依赖几何线索并独立预测每个姿态，无法有效处理模糊运动和真实场景的泛化问题。受人类理解和预测运动方式的启发，需要结合高层意图推理和时间一致性建模。

Method: 1) 使用从2D姿态序列提取的任务相关动作提示动态调节去噪过程；2) 引入表示编码器，在注意力机制中融入运动学关节亲和度；3) 使用幻觉姿态解码器预测时间一致的3D姿态序列。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-3DHP基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。在广播棒球数据集上表现出强大的鲁棒性，能够有效处理模糊和噪声的2D输入，保持时间一致性和意图驱动的运动变化。

Conclusion: DreamPose3D通过结合动作感知推理、结构关系建模和时间想象力，显著提升了3D人体姿态估计的准确性和鲁棒性，特别是在处理模糊运动和真实场景方面表现出色。

Abstract: Accurate 3D human pose estimation remains a critical yet unresolved challenge, requiring both temporal coherence across frames and fine-grained modeling of joint relationships. However, most existing methods rely solely on geometric cues and predict each 3D pose independently, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous motions and generalize to real-world scenarios. Inspired by how humans understand and anticipate motion, we introduce DreamPose3D, a diffusion-based framework that combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation. DreamPose3D dynamically conditions the denoising process using task-relevant action prompts extracted from 2D pose sequences, capturing high-level intent. To model the structural relationships between joints effectively, we introduce a representation encoder that incorporates kinematic joint affinity into the attention mechanism. Finally, a hallucinative pose decoder predicts temporally coherent 3D pose sequences during training, simulating how humans mentally reconstruct motion trajectories to resolve ambiguity in perception. Extensive experiments on benchmarked Human3.6M and MPI-3DHP datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all metrics. To further validate DreamPose3D's robustness, we tested it on a broadcast baseball dataset, where it demonstrated strong performance despite ambiguous and noisy 2D inputs, effectively handling temporal consistency and intent-driven motion variations.

TL;DR: 提出了vMFCoOp框架，通过冯·米塞斯-费希尔分布在共享超球面流形上对齐LLM和CLIP模型的语义偏差，实现稳健的生物医学提示学习和优越的小样本分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM和CLIP模型之间由于不同训练语料和架构导致的语义错位问题，以及传统欧几里得空间优化在多模态对齐中的局限性，特别是在复杂生物医学成像中会放大模态差距并破坏小样本适应的稳定性。

Method: 在共享超球面流形上逆估计冯·米塞斯-费希尔分布，通过统一语义锚点对齐任意LLM和CLIP骨干网络的语义偏差，基于三个互补约束实现稳健的生物医学提示学习。

Result: 在14个医学数据集、12种医学成像模式和13个解剖区域上表现一致改进，在准确性、泛化性和临床适用性方面优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: vMFCoOp框架为生物医学视觉语言模型提供了可扩展的提示学习替代方案，能够稳健地适应不断发展的基础模型家族，并将在未来扩展到更多下游应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in context optimization (CoOp) guided by large language model (LLM)-distilled medical semantic priors offer a scalable alternative to manual prompt engineering and full fine-tuning for adapting biomedical CLIP-based vision-language models (VLMs). However, prompt learning in this context is challenged by semantic misalignment between LLMs and CLIP variants due to divergent training corpora and model architectures; it further lacks scalability across continuously evolving families of foundation models. More critically, pairwise multimodal alignment via conventional Euclidean-space optimization lacks the capacity to model unified representations or apply localized geometric constraints, which tends to amplify modality gaps in complex biomedical imaging and destabilize few-shot adaptation. In this work, we propose vMFCoOp, a framework that inversely estimates von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions on a shared Hyperspherical Manifold, aligning semantic biases between arbitrary LLMs and CLIP backbones via Unified Semantic Anchors to achieve robust biomedical prompting and superior few-shot classification. Grounded in three complementary constraints, vMFCoOp demonstrates consistent improvements across 14 medical datasets, 12 medical imaging modalities, and 13 anatomical regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, generalization, and clinical applicability. This work will be continuously expanded to encompass more downstream applications, and the corresponding resources are intended to be shared through https://github.com/VinyehShaw/UniEqui.

TL;DR: RF-DETR是一个轻量级专业检测器，通过神经架构搜索为任何目标数据集发现精度-延迟帕累托曲线，在COCO和Roboflow100-VL上显著优于现有实时方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放词汇检测器在COCO上表现优异，但在包含预训练未见分布类别的真实世界数据集中泛化能力不足，需要一种轻量级解决方案来适应新领域。

Method: 基于预训练基础网络，在目标数据集上微调，通过权重共享神经架构搜索评估数千种网络配置的精度-延迟权衡，无需重新训练。

Result: RF-DETR在COCO上达到48.0 AP，比D-FINE高5.3 AP；在Roboflow100-VL上比GroundingDINO高1.2 AP且快20倍；RF-DETR (2x-large)是首个在COCO上超过60 AP的实时检测器。

Conclusion: RF-DETR通过神经架构搜索实现了在目标数据集上的高效适应，显著提升了实时检测性能，为开放词汇检测提供了轻量级解决方案。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary detectors achieve impressive performance on COCO, but often fail to generalize to real-world datasets with out-of-distribution classes not typically found in their pre-training. Rather than simply fine-tuning a heavy-weight vision-language model (VLM) for new domains, we introduce RF-DETR, a light-weight specialist detection transformer that discovers accuracy-latency Pareto curves for any target dataset with weight-sharing neural architecture search (NAS). Our approach fine-tunes a pre-trained base network on a target dataset and evaluates thousands of network configurations with different accuracy-latency tradeoffs without re-training. Further, we revisit the "tunable knobs" for NAS to improve the transferability of DETRs to diverse target domains. Notably, RF-DETR significantly improves on prior state-of-the-art real-time methods on COCO and Roboflow100-VL. RF-DETR (nano) achieves 48.0 AP on COCO, beating D-FINE (nano) by 5.3 AP at similar latency, and RF-DETR (2x-large) outperforms GroundingDINO (tiny) by 1.2 AP on Roboflow100-VL while running 20x as fast. To the best of our knowledge, RF-DETR (2x-large) is the first real-time detector to surpass 60 AP on COCO. Our code is at https://github.com/roboflow/rf-detr

### [71] [GMTRouter: Personalized LLM Router over Multi-turn User Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08590)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GMTRouter是一个基于异构图学习的个性化LLM路由框架，能够从少量数据中学习用户偏好，实现高效个性化路由选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM路由方法缺乏完全个性化，难以捕捉用户与LLM之间的复杂交互关系，且用户偏好数据通常稀缺、噪声大、格式不一致。

Method: 将多轮用户-LLM交互表示为包含用户、LLM、查询和响应四种节点的异构图，通过定制化消息传递机制在轻量级归纳图学习框架中学习用户偏好。

Result: 在多个数据集上准确率提升0.9-21.6%，AUC提升0.006-0.309，能够仅用少量数据适应新用户和演化偏好，无需大量微调。

Conclusion: GMTRouter通过图结构建模有效解决了LLM路由中的个性化挑战，在数据稀缺情况下仍能实现高质量的路由决策。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) routing has demonstrated strong capability in balancing response quality with computational cost. As users exhibit diverse preferences, personalization has attracted increasing attention in LLM routing, since even identical queries may require different models to generate responses tailored to individual needs. However, existing approaches are not fully personalized and often fail to capture the complex interactions between specific users and LLMs. Moreover, user preference data is typically scarce, noisy, and inconsistent in format, which limits the effectiveness of methods that rely solely on user-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose GMTRouter, which represents multi-turn user-LLM interactions as a heterogeneous graph with four node types: user, LLM, query, and response, thereby preserving the rich relational structure of the interaction. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, GMTRouter learns to capture user preferences from few-shot data within a lightweight inductive graph learning framework, enabling effective personalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMTRouter consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.9 to 21.6 percent higher accuracy and 0.006 to 0.309 higher AUC across multiple datasets. More importantly, we demonstrate that GMTRouter can adapt to new users and evolving preferences using only few-shot data, without extensive fine-tuning. The code for GMTRouter is publicly available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GMTRouter.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在模拟社交媒体群组对话方面的有效性，探索其在内容推荐算法测试和政策干预评估等应用中的潜力，同时测试这些模拟对话能否欺骗人类读者。

Method: 从Reddit收集真实人类对话，使用Llama 3 70B和GPT-4o在同一话题上生成人工对话，通过并排展示给研究参与者进行识别测试。

Result: LLM生成的对话被误认为人类创作的概率为39%，其中Llama 3生成的对话被正确识别为AI生成的概率仅56%，接近随机猜测水平。

Conclusion: LLMs能够生成足够逼真的社交媒体对话来欺骗人类读者，这既显示了其在社交模拟方面的巨大潜力，也警示了LLMs可能被滥用于生成虚假社交媒体内容的风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new avenues to simulate online communities and social media. Potential applications range from testing the design of content recommendation algorithms to estimating the effects of content policies and interventions. However, the validity of using LLMs to simulate conversations between various users remains largely untested. We evaluated whether LLMs can convincingly mimic human group conversations on social media. We collected authentic human conversations from Reddit and generated artificial conversations on the same topic with two LLMs: Llama 3 70B and GPT-4o. When presented side-by-side to study participants, LLM-generated conversations were mistaken for human-created content 39\% of the time. In particular, when evaluating conversations generated by Llama 3, participants correctly identified them as AI-generated only 56\% of the time, barely better than random chance. Our study demonstrates that LLMs can generate social media conversations sufficiently realistic to deceive humans when reading them, highlighting both a promising potential for social simulation and a warning message about the potential misuse of LLMs to generate new inauthentic social media content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在法律领域具有变革潜力，但存在矛盾：既能分析法律，又可能生成危险内容。需要系统评估LLM对敏感法律的理解能力和安全漏洞。

Method: 结合知识图谱构建和检索增强生成(RAG)方法，通过结构化实验评估LLM对Title 18 Section 175法律的理解、法律意图判断能力以及潜在危险应用。

Result: 发现LLM在法律推理和安全机制方面存在显著局限性，但能够识别法律违规行为、生成禁止性指令并检测非法意图。

Conclusion: 通过增强安全协议和更强大的法律推理框架，可以开发出能够道德安全地协助敏感法律领域的LLM，确保其成为法律的保护者而非无意中的违法促成者。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential for interpreting complex legal frameworks, such as Title 18 Section 175 of the US Code, which governs biological weapons. These systems hold promise for advancing legal analysis and compliance monitoring in sensitive domains. However, this capability comes with a troubling contradiction: while LLMs can analyze and interpret laws, they also demonstrate alarming vulnerabilities in generating unsafe outputs, such as actionable steps for bioweapon creation, despite their safeguards. To address this challenge, we propose a methodology that integrates knowledge graph construction with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to systematically evaluate LLMs' understanding of this law, their capacity to assess legal intent (mens rea), and their potential for unsafe applications. Through structured experiments, we assess their accuracy in identifying legal violations, generating prohibited instructions, and detecting unlawful intent in bioweapons-related scenarios. Our findings reveal significant limitations in LLMs' reasoning and safety mechanisms, but they also point the way forward. By combining enhanced safety protocols with more robust legal reasoning frameworks, this research lays the groundwork for developing LLMs that can ethically and securely assist in sensitive legal domains - ensuring they act as protectors of the law rather than inadvertent enablers of its violation.

TL;DR: 本文提出Soft Preference Learning方法来解决RLHF和DPO等对齐算法导致的LLM输出多样性下降问题，通过解耦KL散度正则化中的熵和交叉熵项，实现对生成多样性的精细控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐算法（如RLHF、DPO）显著降低了LLM输出的多样性，导致模型生成重复结构、用词单一，且反映的社会观点范围变窄。这主要是由于KL散度正则化使模型过度重视多数意见而牺牲多样性。

Method: 提出Soft Preference Learning方法，解构KL散度正则化中的熵和交叉熵项，从而能够精细控制LLM的生成多样性。该方法类似于但优于标准的温度缩放。

Result: 从能力角度看，使用Soft Preference Learning训练的LLM在困难重复采样任务上获得更高准确率，输出具有更大的语义和词汇多样性。从对齐角度看，这些模型能代表更广泛的社会观点，并显示出改进的对数校准。

Conclusion: Soft Preference Learning是对现有偏好学习算法的帕累托改进，能够有效提升LLM输出的多样性，同时保持或改善其能力表现。

Abstract: The ability of LLMs to represent diverse perspectives is critical as they increasingly impact society. However, recent studies reveal that alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO significantly reduce the diversity of LLM outputs. Not only do aligned LLMs generate text with repetitive structure and word choice, they also approach problems in more uniform ways, and their responses reflect a narrower range of societal perspectives. We attribute this problem to the KL divergence regularizer employed in preference learning algorithms. This causes the model to systematically overweight majority opinions and sacrifice diversity in its outputs. To address this, we propose Soft Preference Learning, which decouples the entropy and cross-entropy terms in the KL penalty - allowing for fine-grained control over LLM generation diversity. From a capabilities perspective, LLMs trained using Soft Preference Learning attain higher accuracy on difficult repeated sampling tasks and produce outputs with greater semantic and lexical diversity. From an alignment perspective, they are capable of representing a wider range of societal viewpoints and display improved logit calibration. Notably, Soft Preference Learning resembles, but is a Pareto improvement over, standard temperature scaling.

Method: 提出语义相似性动态剪枝(SSDP)框架，集成在线语义合并到并行树搜索中，实时聚类和剪枝冗余推理步骤。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH500等推理基准测试中，相比最先进的树搜索基线，速度提升达2.3倍，准确率保持在最强基线的5%以内，节点探索减少85-90%。

Conclusion: SSDP为高效、可扩展的LLM推理提供了一种实用方法，显著提升了树搜索推理的效率。

Abstract: Tree-of-Thought (ToT) reasoning boosts the problem-solving abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) but is computationally expensive due to semantic redundancy, where distinct branches explore equivalent reasoning paths. We introduce Semantic Similarity-Based Dynamic Pruning (SSDP), a lightweight method that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first framework to integrate online semantic merging into parallelized tree search, enabling the clustering and pruning of redundant steps in real time. Across reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K and MATH500, SSDP achieves up to a 2.3x speedup over state-of-the-art tree-search baselines while maintaining competitive accuracy (typically within 5% of the strongest baseline) and reducing the number of explored nodes by 85-90%, demonstrating a practical approach to efficient, scalable LLM reasoning. The implementation of SSDP is publicly available at https://github.com/kimjoonghokim/SSDP.

Motivation: 幻觉问题严重阻碍LLM在高风险领域的实际部署，需要测试其在对抗性提示下的事实保真度。

Method: 三步框架：1)让LLM生成特定领域的真假陈述；2)让LLM验证这些陈述的真假；3)测试LLM对自身生成谎言的抵抗力。

Result: 在电影和小说两个封闭领域测试5个主流LLM，发现Claude抗性最强，GPT和Grok中等，Gemini和DeepSeek最弱。

Conclusion: 随着越来越多用户使用LLM进行信息检索，这些发现敲响了警钟，表明需要提高LLM的事实保真度。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a critical challenge to the real-world deployment of large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains. In this paper, we present a framework for stress testing factual fidelity in LLMs in the presence of adversarial nudge. Our framework consists of three steps. In the first step, we instruct the LLM to produce sets of truths and lies consistent with the closed domain in question. In the next step, we instruct the LLM to verify the same set of assertions as truths and lies consistent with the same closed domain. In the final step, we test the robustness of the LLM against the lies generated (and verified) by itself. Our extensive evaluation, conducted using five widely known proprietary LLMs across two closed domains of popular movies and novels, reveals a wide range of susceptibility to adversarial nudges: \texttt{Claude} exhibits strong resilience, \texttt{GPT} and \texttt{Grok} demonstrate moderate resilience, while \texttt{Gemini} and \texttt{DeepSeek} show weak resilience. Considering that a large population is increasingly using LLMs for information seeking, our findings raise alarm.

Motivation: 现有防御机制假设攻击者来自外部，但未充分探索模型自身输出成为新攻击向量的可能性。

Method: 使用同一模型生成的模糊有害查询(MHQ)作为新输入，在独立会话中重新输入，验证是否发生越狱。在Base、Zero-shot和Few-shot条件下测试GPT-3.5-turbo等模型。

Result: Zero-shot条件下最高52%转换成功率和33%越狱成功率；Few-shot条件下最高65%转换成功率和41%越狱成功率。自动评估高估越狱成功率52%。

Conclusion: 需要重新考虑防护机制设计并建立更鲁棒的评估方法，自动评估单独使用不够准确。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are generally equipped with guardrails to block the generation of harmful responses. However, existing defenses always assume that an external attacker crafts the harmful query, and the possibility of a model's own output becoming a new attack vector has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we propose the Self-HarmLLM scenario, which uses a Mitigated Harmful Query (MHQ) generated by the same model as a new input. An MHQ is an ambiguous query whose original intent is preserved while its harmful nature is not directly exposed. We verified whether a jailbreak occurs when this MHQ is re-entered into a separate session of the same model. We conducted experiments on GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B-instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B under Base, Zero-shot, and Few-shot conditions. The results showed up to 52% transformation success rate and up to 33% jailbreak success rate in the Zero-shot condition, and up to 65% transformation success rate and up to 41% jailbreak success rate in the Few-shot condition. By performing both prefix-based automated evaluation and human evaluation, we found that the automated evaluation consistently overestimated jailbreak success, with an average difference of 52%. This indicates that automated evaluation alone is not accurate for determining harmfulness. While this study is a toy-level study based on a limited query set and evaluators, it proves that our method can still be a valid attack scenario. These results suggest the need for a fundamental reconsideration of guardrail design and the establishment of a more robust evaluation methodology.

Result: 评估了各种开源和专有LLM，发现模型在面对新信息时表现出不同的行为，检索缩小了大小模型之间的性能差距。

Conclusion: 评估LLM在演化知识基准上的表现至关重要，OKBench框架能够促进检索增强方法的全面评估。

Abstract: Knowledge-intensive question answering is central to large language models (LLMs) and is typically assessed using static benchmarks derived from sources like Wikipedia and textbooks. However, these benchmarks fail to capture evolving knowledge in a dynamic world, and centralized curation struggles to keep pace with rapid LLM advancements. To address these drawbacks, we propose Open Knowledge Bench (OKBench), a fully automated framework for generating high-quality, dynamic knowledge benchmarks on demand. Focusing on the news domain where knowledge updates daily, OKBench is an agentic framework that automates the sourcing, creation, validation, and distribution of benchmarks. Our approach democratizes benchmark creation and facilitates thorough evaluation of retrieval-augmented methods by reducing overlap with pretraining data. We evaluate our framework on a wide range open-source and proprietary LLMs of various sizes and configurations, both with and without retrieval over freshly generated knowledge. Our results reveal distinct model behaviors when confronted with new information and highlight how retrieval narrows the performance gap between small and large models. These findings underscore the importance of evaluating LLMs on evolving knowledge benchmarks.

Abstract: Clinical vignettes are essential educational tools in speech-language pathology (SLP), but manual creation is time-intensive. While general-purpose large language models (LLMs) can generate text, they lack domain-specific knowledge, leading to hallucinations and requiring extensive expert revision. This study presents a proof-of-concept system integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with curated knowledge bases to generate pediatric SLP case materials. A multi-model RAG-based system was prototyped integrating curated domain knowledge with engineered prompt templates, supporting five commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) and open-source (Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5-7B) LLMs. Seven test scenarios spanning diverse disorder types and grade levels were systematically designed. Generated cases underwent automated quality assessment using a multi-dimensional rubric evaluating structural completeness, internal consistency, clinical appropriateness, and IEP goal/session note quality. This proof-of-concept demonstrates technical feasibility for RAG-augmented generation of pediatric SLP vignettes. Commercial models showed marginal quality advantages, but open-source alternatives achieved acceptable performance, suggesting potential for privacy-preserving institutional deployment. Integration of curated knowledge bases enabled content generation aligned with professional guidelines. Extensive validation through expert review, student pilot testing, and psychometric evaluation is required before educational or research implementation. Future applications may extend to clinical decision support, automated IEP goal generation, and clinical reflection training.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将DisCoCirc形式化框架从英语扩展到孟加拉语，并评估其在翻译任务中的有效性，特别是检验其减少语言官僚主义的能力。

Method: 基于DisCoCirc的语法规则和电路表示，构建孟加拉语的形式化框架，应用于英-孟翻译任务，并分析其局限性。

Result: 与先前研究相反，DisCoCirc在英-孟翻译中表现有限，即使处理简单句子也存在困难，主要由于两种语言的结构差异。

Conclusion: DisCoCirc框架在跨语言翻译中存在约束，需要进一步改进以处理语言结构差异，同时发现连词与布尔逻辑之间的联系。

Abstract: In [4], the authors present the DisCoCirc (Distributed Compositional Circuits) formalism for the English language, a grammar-based framework derived from the production rules that incorporates circuit-like representations in order to give a precise categorical theoretical structure to the language. In this paper, we extend this approach to develop a similar framework for Bengali and apply it to translation tasks between English and Bengali. A central focus of our work lies in reassessing the effectiveness of DisCoCirc in reducing language bureaucracy. Unlike the result suggested in [5], our findings indicate that although it works well for a large part of the language, it still faces limitations due to the structural variation of the two languages. We discuss the possible methods that might handle these shortcomings and show that, in practice, DisCoCirc still struggles even with relatively simple sentences. This divergence from prior claims not only highlights the framework's constraints in translation but also suggest scope for future improvement. Apart from our primary focus on English-Bengali translation, we also take a short detour to examine English conjunctions, following [1], showing a connection between conjunctions and Boolean logic.

Abstract: Bangladesh's low-income population faces major barriers to affordable legal advice due to complex legal language, procedural opacity, and high costs. Existing AI legal assistants lack Bengali-language support and jurisdiction-specific adaptation, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we developed Mina, a multilingual LLM-based legal assistant tailored for the Bangladeshi context. It employs multilingual embeddings and a RAG-based chain-of-tools framework for retrieval, reasoning, translation, and document generation, delivering context-aware legal drafts, citations, and plain-language explanations via an interactive chat interface. Evaluated by law faculty from leading Bangladeshi universities across all stages of the 2022 and 2023 Bangladesh Bar Council Exams, Mina scored 75-80% in Preliminary MCQs, Written, and simulated Viva Voce exams, matching or surpassing average human performance and demonstrating clarity, contextual understanding, and sound legal reasoning. These results confirm its potential as a low-cost, multilingual AI assistant that automates key legal tasks and scales access to justice, offering a real-world case study on building domain-specific, low-resource systems and addressing challenges of multilingual adaptation, efficiency, and sustainable public-service AI deployment.

Motivation: AI和LLM在医疗决策支持系统中具有重要应用价值，特别是在急诊医学中需要快速准确诊断急性疾病。

Method: 构建MEDAS超级学习器，整合Gemini、Llama、Grok、GPT和Claude五个主要LLM，使用元学习器学习每个LLM的不同能力，通过集体能力提升诊断准确率。

Result: 单个LLM诊断准确率在58%-65%之间，超级学习器准确率达到70%，其中一个集成LLM单独可达85%准确率。

Conclusion: 通过元学习方法整合多个LLM的集体知识，可以显著提升医疗急诊诊断的准确率，超过任何单个LLM的表现。

Abstract: Medical decision-support and advising systems are critical for emergency physicians to quickly and accurately assess patients' conditions and make diagnosis. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in healthcare in recent years and Large Language Models (LLMs) have been employed in various fields of medical decision-support systems. We studied responses of a group of different LLMs to real cases in emergency medicine. The results of our study on five most renown LLMs showed significant differences in capabilities of Large Language Models for diagnostics acute diseases in medical emergencies with accuracy ranging between 58% and 65%. This accuracy significantly exceeds the reported accuracy of human doctors. We built a super-learner MEDAS (Medical Emergency Diagnostic Advising System) of five major LLMs - Gemini, Llama, Grok, GPT, and Claude). The super-learner produces higher diagnostic accuracy, 70%, even with a quite basic meta-learner. However, at least one of the integrated LLMs in the same super-learner produces 85% correct diagnoses. The super-learner integrates a cluster of LLMs using a meta-learner capable of learning different capabilities of each LLM to leverage diagnostic accuracy of the model by collective capabilities of all LLMs in the cluster. The results of our study showed that aggregated diagnostic accuracy provided by a meta-learning approach exceeds that of any individual LLM, suggesting that the super-learner can take advantage of the combined knowledge of the medical datasets used to train the group of LLMs.

Conclusion: GrADS方法能够高效选择代表性样本，显著提升LLM领域专业化微调的效率和效果，同时有效缓解灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive achievements across numerous tasks, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) remains essential for adapting these models to specialized domains. However, SFT for domain specialization can be resource-intensive and sometimes leads to a deterioration in performance over general capabilities due to catastrophic forgetting (CF). To address these issues, we propose a self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection approach (GrADS) for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, which identifies effective subsets of training data by analyzing gradients obtained from a preliminary training phase. Specifically, we design self-guided criteria that leverage the magnitude and statistical distribution of gradients to prioritize examples that contribute the most to the model's learning process. This approach enables the acquisition of representative samples that enhance LLMs understanding of domain-specific tasks. Through extensive experimentation with various LLMs across diverse domains such as medicine, law, and finance, GrADS has demonstrated significant efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Remarkably, utilizing merely 5% of the selected GrADS data, LLMs already surpass the performance of those fine-tuned on the entire dataset, and increasing to 50% of the data results in significant improvements! With catastrophic forgetting substantially mitigated simultaneously. We will release our code for GrADS later.

Motivation: 自杀是青少年第二大死因，过去自杀企图是未来自杀的重要预测因素。许多有自杀想法的人在社交媒体上发出信号，需要有效识别这些模式。

Method: 使用CNN架构进行局部特征提取，结合BiGRU技术进行双向序列建模，并应用注意力机制和SHAP可解释AI方法来解释预测结果。

Result: 在公开数据集上实验，准确率达到93.97%，与现有最先进的机器学习和深度学习模型相比表现出优越性。

Conclusion: 提出的CNN-BiGRU混合深度学习框架结合SHAP可解释性，为自杀检测提供了一个全面有效的解决方案，在准确性和可解释性方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Worldwide, suicide is the second leading cause of death for adolescents with past suicide attempts to be an important predictor for increased future suicides. While some people with suicidal thoughts may try to suppress them, many signal their intentions in social media platforms. To address these issues, we propose a new type of hybrid deep learning scheme, i.e., the combination of a CNN architecture and a BiGRU technique, which can accurately identify the patterns of suicidal ideation from SN datasets. Also, we apply Explainable AI methods using SHapley Additive exPlanations to interpret the prediction results and verifying the model reliability. This integration of CNN local feature extraction, BiGRU bidirectional sequence modeling, attention mechanisms, and SHAP interpretability provides a comprehensive framework for suicide detection. Training and evaluation of the system were performed on a publicly available dataset. Several performance metrics were used for evaluating model performance. Our method was found to have achieved 93.97 accuracy in experimental results. Comparative study to different state-of-the-art Machine Learning and DL models and existing literature demonstrates the superiority of our proposed technique over all the competing methods.

Motivation: LLM代理在工具调用时，模糊的用户指令会导致错误调用和任务失败，需要更有效的澄清机制

Method: 将工具参数的结构化不确定性建模为POMDP，使用EVPI目标进行最优问题选择，采用基于方面的成本建模防止冗余

Result: 在ClarifyBench基准测试中表现优异，同时结构化不确定性为强化学习提供有效训练信号，将When2Call准确率从36.5%提升至65.2%

Conclusion: 结构化不确定性为工具增强代理提供了原则性、高效的方法，在现实场景中同时提高了任务成功率和交互效率

Abstract: LLM agents extend large language models with tool-calling capabilities, but ambiguous user instructions often lead to incorrect invocations and task failures. We introduce a principled formulation of structured uncertainty over tool-call parameters, modeling joint tool-argument clarification as a POMDP with Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) objective for optimal question selection and aspect-based cost modeling to prevent redundancy. Our SAGE-Agent leverages this structured uncertainty to achieve superior efficiency: increasing coverage on ambiguous tasks by 7-39\% while reducing clarification questions by 1.5-2.7$\times$ compared to strong prompting and uncertainty-based baselines. We present ClarifyBench, the first multi-turn tool-augmented disambiguation benchmark with realistic LLM-based user simulation across diverse domains including document editing, vehicle control, and travel booking. Additionally, we demonstrate that structured uncertainty provides effective training signals for reinforcement learning, boosting When2Call accuracy from 36.5\% to 65.2\% (3B model) and 36.7\% to 62.9\% (7B model) through uncertainty-weighted GRPO training. These results establish structured uncertainty as a principled, efficient approach for tool-augmented agents, improving both task success and interaction efficiency in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 本研究开发并评估了三种NLP模型，用于从帕金森病患者自述中自动识别认知过程类别。微调的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct模型表现最佳，总体F1分数最高，尤其在思想和社交互动等上下文相关类别中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解帕金森病患者日常生活中的认知体验描述可以为疾病相关的认知和情感变化提供宝贵见解，但从非结构化患者叙述中提取此类信息具有挑战性。

Method: 比较了三种模型家族：基于Bio_ClinicalBERT的嵌套实体识别模型、使用QLoRA微调的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct指令遵循模型，以及在零样本和少样本设置下评估的GPT-4o mini模型，用于提取七个认知类别。

Result: 模型性能在不同类别和模型家族间差异显著。微调的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct获得最高总体F1分数（微平均0.74，宏平均0.59），在思想和社交互动等上下文相关类别中表现优异。Bio_ClinicalBERT精度高但召回率低。

Conclusion: 虽然由于认知过程叙述的抽象和重叠性质，该任务比传统信息提取更具挑战性，但经过持续改进，这些NLP系统有望实现低负担的纵向认知功能监测，并作为帕金森病正式神经心理学评估的有价值补充。

Abstract: Understanding how individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) describe cognitive experiences in their daily lives can offer valuable insights into disease-related cognitive and emotional changes. However, extracting such information from unstructured patient narratives is challenging due to the subtle, overlapping nature of cognitive constructs. This study developed and evaluated natural language processing (NLP) models to automatically identify categories that reflect various cognitive processes from de-identified first-person narratives. Three model families, a Bio_ClinicalBERT-based span categorization model for nested entity recognition, a fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct model using QLoRA for instruction following, and GPT-4o mini evaluated under zero- and few-shot settings, were compared on their performance on extracting seven categories. Our findings indicated that model performance varied substantially across categories and model families. The fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct achieved the highest overall F1-scores (0.74 micro-average and 0.59 macro-average), particularly excelling in context-dependent categories such as thought and social interaction. Bio_ClinicalBERT exhibited high precision but low recall and performed comparable to Llama for some category types such as location and time but failed on other categories such as thought, emotion and social interaction. Compared to conventional information extraction tasks, this task presents a greater challenge due to the abstract and overlapping nature of narrative accounts of complex cognitive processes. Nonetheless, with continued refinement, these NLP systems hold promise for enabling low-burden, longitudinal monitoring of cognitive function and serving as a valuable complement to formal neuropsychological assessments in PD.

Conclusion: BNLI为推进孟加拉语和其他低资源语言推理任务的研究奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Despite the growing progress in Natural Language Inference (NLI) research, resources for the Bengali language remain extremely limited. Existing Bengali NLI datasets exhibit several inconsistencies, including annotation errors, ambiguous sentence pairs, and inadequate linguistic diversity, which hinder effective model training and evaluation. To address these limitations, we introduce BNLI, a refined and linguistically curated Bengali NLI dataset designed to support robust language understanding and inference modeling. The dataset was constructed through a rigorous annotation pipeline emphasizing semantic clarity and balance across entailment, contradiction, and neutrality classes. We benchmarked BNLI using a suite of state-of-the-art transformer-based architectures, including multilingual and Bengali-specific models, to assess their ability to capture complex semantic relations in Bengali text. The experimental findings highlight the improved reliability and interpretability achieved with BNLI, establishing it as a strong foundation for advancing research in Bengali and other low-resource language inference tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对话系统分别开发任务导向对话和闲聊功能，但真实对话需要在这两种模式间自然过渡，现有方法缺乏对这种动态切换的支持。

Method: 构建TACT数据集支持用户和代理驱动的模式切换，提出Switch和Recovery评估指标，并应用Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)进行模型优化。

Result: 在TACT上训练的模型在意图检测和模式切换处理上优于基线，DPO进一步提升了性能，达到75.74%的联合模式-意图准确率和70.1%的人类评估胜率。

Conclusion: 结构多样化的数据与DPO结合能够显著提升对话质量和过渡控制能力，为开发更主动和过渡感知的对话代理铺平了道路。

Abstract: Conversational agents have traditionally been developed for either task-oriented dialogue (TOD) or open-ended chitchat, with limited progress in unifying the two. Yet, real-world conversations naturally involve fluid transitions between these modes. To address this gap, we introduce TACT (TOD-And-Chitchat Transition), a dataset designed for transition-aware dialogue modeling that incorporates structurally diverse and integrated mode flows. TACT supports both user- and agent-driven mode switches, enabling robust modeling of complex conversational dynamics. To evaluate an agent's ability to initiate and recover from mode transitions, we propose two new metrics -- Switch and Recovery. Models trained on TACT outperform baselines in both intent detection and mode transition handling. Moreover, applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to TACT-trained models yields additional gains, achieving 75.74\% joint mode-intent accuracy and a 70.1\% win rate against GPT-4o in human evaluation. These results demonstrate that pairing structurally diverse data with DPO enhances response quality and transition control, paving the way for more proactive and transition-aware conversational agents.

Conclusion: BioVerge为生物医学假设生成提供了标准化环境，证明LLM代理能够有效探索科学知识前沿，结合多种数据源和自我评估机制可产生更高质量的假设。

Abstract: Hypothesis generation in biomedical research has traditionally centered on uncovering hidden relationships within vast scientific literature, often using methods like Literature-Based Discovery (LBD). Despite progress, current approaches typically depend on single data types or predefined extraction patterns, which restricts the discovery of novel and complex connections. Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents show significant potential, with capabilities in information retrieval, reasoning, and generation. However, their application to biomedical hypothesis generation has been limited by the absence of standardized datasets and execution environments. To address this, we introduce BioVerge, a comprehensive benchmark, and BioVerge Agent, an LLM-based agent framework, to create a standardized environment for exploring biomedical hypothesis generation at the frontier of existing scientific knowledge. Our dataset includes structured and textual data derived from historical biomedical hypotheses and PubMed literature, organized to support exploration by LLM agents. BioVerge Agent utilizes a ReAct-based approach with distinct Generation and Evaluation modules that iteratively produce and self-assess hypothesis proposals. Through extensive experimentation, we uncover key insights: 1) different architectures of BioVerge Agent influence exploration diversity and reasoning strategies; 2) structured and textual information sources each provide unique, critical contexts that enhance hypothesis generation; and 3) self-evaluation significantly improves the novelty and relevance of proposed hypotheses.

TL;DR: LLM生成参考文献的准确性与其在预训练语料中的出现频率（以引用次数为代理）密切相关，引用次数超过1000的论文几乎被逐字记忆，而引用次数低的论文更容易产生幻觉引用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在生成参考文献时产生虚假论文（幻觉引用）的问题，探索引用频率如何影响LLM输出的准确性。

Method: 使用GPT-4生成100个计算机科学领域的引用，通过余弦相似度比较生成引用与真实元数据的事实一致性，分析引用次数与准确性的关系。

Result: 引用次数与事实准确性呈强相关；超过约1000次引用的参考文献几乎被逐字记忆；当多个高引用论文内容相似时会出现记忆干扰。

Conclusion: LLM存在从泛化到记忆的阈值，高引用论文几乎被逐字保留在模型中，引用频率是预测LLM生成参考文献准确性的重要指标。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they have also been used to assist in citation recommendation, the hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce bibliographic records depends on whether the underlying knowledge is generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear in the pretraining corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency with which a given bibliographic record appears in the pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified 100 citations across twenty computer-science domains, and measured factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata. The results revealed that (i) citation count is strongly correlated with factual accuracy, (ii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatim memorized beyond roughly 1,000 citations, and (iii) memory interference occurs when multiple highly cited papers share similar content. These findings indicate a threshold where generalization shifts into memorization, with highly cited papers being nearly verbatim retained in the model.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks, yet they often produce hallucinated content that undermines factual reliability. To address this challenge, we introduce HalluClean, a lightweight and task-agnostic framework for detecting and correcting hallucinations in LLM-generated text. HalluClean adopts a reasoning-enhanced paradigm, explicitly decomposing the process into planning, execution, and revision stages to identify and refine unsupported claims. It employs minimal task-routing prompts to enable zero-shot generalization across diverse domains, without relying on external knowledge sources or supervised detectors. We conduct extensive evaluations on five representative tasks-question answering, dialogue, summarization, math word problems, and contradiction detection. Experimental results show that HalluClean significantly improves factual consistency and outperforms competitive baselines, demonstrating its potential to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM outputs in real-world applications.

Motivation: 解决扩散模型并行生成与自回归模型质量优势之间的矛盾，寻求在保持高质量的同时实现高吞吐量和GPU利用率。

Method: 使用结构化注意力掩码在单次前向传播中同时进行扩散草稿生成和自回归采样，充分利用GPU计算密度。

Result: TiDAR在1.5B和8B规模上超越推测解码的吞吐量，在效率和质最上优于Dream和Llada等扩散模型，首次在保持AR模型质量的同时实现4.71-5.91倍的每秒token生成量。

Conclusion: TiDAR成功弥合了扩散模型与自回归模型之间的质量差距，同时显著提升了生成效率，为语言模型架构提供了新的平衡方案。

Abstract: Diffusion language models hold the promise of fast parallel generation, while autoregressive (AR) models typically excel in quality due to their causal structure aligning naturally with language modeling. This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve a synergy with high throughput, higher GPU utilization, and AR level quality? Existing methods fail to effectively balance these two aspects, either prioritizing AR using a weaker model for sequential drafting (speculative decoding), leading to lower drafting efficiency, or using some form of left-to-right (AR-like) decoding logic for diffusion, which still suffers from quality degradation and forfeits its potential parallelizability. We introduce TiDAR, a sequence-level hybrid architecture that drafts tokens (Thinking) in Diffusion and samples final outputs (Talking) AutoRegressively - all within a single forward pass using specially designed structured attention masks. This design exploits the free GPU compute density, achieving a strong balance between drafting and verification capacity. Moreover, TiDAR is designed to be serving-friendly (low overhead) as a standalone model. We extensively evaluate TiDAR against AR models, speculative decoding, and diffusion variants across generative and likelihood tasks at 1.5B and 8B scales. Thanks to the parallel drafting and sampling as well as exact KV cache support, TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in measured throughput and surpasses diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality. Most notably, TiDAR is the first architecture to close the quality gap with AR models while delivering 4.71x to 5.91x more tokens per second.

Conclusion: LLM方法能够扩展错误检测规模，在减少人工努力的同时提高标签变异下数据集的质量。

Abstract: High-quality datasets are critical for training and evaluating reliable NLP models. In tasks like natural language inference (NLI), human label variation (HLV) arises when multiple labels are valid for the same instance, making it difficult to separate annotation errors from plausible variation. An earlier framework VARIERR (Weber-Genzel et al., 2024) asks multiple annotators to explain their label decisions in the first round and flag errors via validity judgments in the second round. However, conducting two rounds of manual annotation is costly and may limit the coverage of plausible labels or explanations. Our study proposes a new framework, EVADE, for generating and validating explanations to detect errors using large language models (LLMs). We perform a comprehensive analysis comparing human- and LLM-detected errors for NLI across distribution comparison, validation overlap, and impact on model fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM validation refines generated explanation distributions to more closely align with human annotations, and that removing LLM-detected errors from training data yields improvements in fine-tuning performance than removing errors identified by human annotators. This highlights the potential to scale error detection, reducing human effort while improving dataset quality under label variation.

Motivation: 现有潜在推理方法缺乏确保潜在表示稳定演化的机制，也没有系统化的方式来交织隐式和显式推理。

Method: 引入SpiralThinker框架，对潜在表示进行迭代更新，实现无需生成额外token的扩展隐式推理。采用渐进对齐目标和结构化标注来维持潜在推理与文本推理之间的一致性。

Result: 在数学、逻辑和常识推理任务中，SpiralThinker在潜在推理方法中取得了最佳整体性能，在所有基准测试中持续超越先前方法。

Conclusion: SpiralThinker将迭代计算与潜在推理相结合，证明对齐的迭代更新可以在潜在空间中可靠地引导推理过程。

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have been driven by reinforcement learning and test-time scaling, accompanied by growing interest in latent rather than purely textual reasoning. However, existing latent reasoning methods lack mechanisms to ensure stable evolution of latent representations and a systematic way to interleave implicit and explicit reasoning. We introduce SpiralThinker, a unified framework that performs iterative updates over latent representations, enabling extended implicit reasoning without generating additional tokens. A progressive alignment objective combined with structured annotations maintains coherence between latent and textual reasoning. Across mathematical, logical, and commonsense reasoning tasks, SpiralThinker achieves the best overall performance among latent reasoning approaches, consistently surpassing previous methods across all benchmarks. Detailed analyses reveal that both iteration and alignment are indispensable, the numbers of latent tokens and iterations exhibit dataset-specific optima, and appropriate alignment proves critical for an effective iterative process. Overall, SpiralThinker bridges iterative computation and latent reasoning, demonstrating that aligned iterative updates can reliably steer reasoning in the latent space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型情感支持评估多依赖短对话和静态评估，无法捕捉情感支持的动态性和长期性特征。

Method: 构建大规模基准测试，使用已验证的情绪调节策略约束模型输出，将用户情感轨迹建模为一阶马尔可夫过程，并应用因果调整的情感估计来获得无偏的情感状态跟踪。

Result: 评估发现不同LLMs在情感支持能力上存在显著差异，为模型开发提供了可操作的见解。

Conclusion: 轨迹级评估框架能够更全面地评估LLMs的长期情感支持性能，揭示了模型在动态情感支持方面的能力差异。

Abstract: Emotional support is a core capability in human-AI interaction, with applications including psychological counseling, role play, and companionship. However, existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) often rely on short, static dialogues and fail to capture the dynamic and long-term nature of emotional support. To overcome this limitation, we shift from snapshot-based evaluation to trajectory-based assessment, adopting a user-centered perspective that evaluates models based on their ability to improve and stabilize user emotional states over time. Our framework constructs a large-scale benchmark consisting of 328 emotional contexts and 1,152 disturbance events, simulating realistic emotional shifts under evolving dialogue scenarios. To encourage psychologically grounded responses, we constrain model outputs using validated emotion regulation strategies such as situation selection and cognitive reappraisal. User emotional trajectories are modeled as a first-order Markov process, and we apply causally-adjusted emotion estimation to obtain unbiased emotional state tracking. Based on this framework, we introduce three trajectory-level metrics: Baseline Emotional Level (BEL), Emotional Trajectory Volatility (ETV), and Emotional Centroid Position (ECP). These metrics collectively capture user emotional dynamics over time and support comprehensive evaluation of long-term emotional support performance of LLMs. Extensive evaluations across a diverse set of LLMs reveal significant disparities in emotional support capabilities and provide actionable insights for model development.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在金融、医疗等受严格政策监管行业中的随机性限制问题，确保逻辑验证的可靠性。

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 使用LLMs和可选人工指导将自然语言政策形式化；2) 推理时自动形式化验证自然语言语句的逻辑正确性，采用多重冗余形式化步骤进行语义等价性交叉检查。

Conclusion: 该方法产生可审计的逻辑工件来支持验证结果，并能用于改进原始文本，为受监管行业提供可靠的逻辑验证解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models perform well at natural language interpretation and reasoning, but their inherent stochasticity limits their adoption in regulated industries like finance and healthcare that operate under strict policies. To address this limitation, we present a two-stage neurosymbolic framework that (1) uses LLMs with optional human guidance to formalize natural language policies, allowing fine-grained control of the formalization process, and (2) uses inference-time autoformalization to validate logical correctness of natural language statements against those policies. When correctness is paramount, we perform multiple redundant formalization steps at inference time, cross checking the formalizations for semantic equivalence. Our benchmarks demonstrate that our approach exceeds 99% soundness, indicating a near-zero false positive rate in identifying logical validity. Our approach produces auditable logical artifacts that substantiate the verification outcomes and can be used to improve the original text.

Abstract: The ability of critique is vital for models to self-improve and serve as reliable AI assistants. While extensively studied in language-only settings, multimodal critique of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) remains underexplored despite their growing capabilities in tasks like captioning and visual reasoning. In this work, we introduce MM-CRITIC, a holistic benchmark for evaluating the critique ability of LMMs across multiple dimensions: basic, correction, and comparison. Covering 8 main task types and over 500 tasks, MM-CRITIC collects responses from various LMMs with different model sizes and is composed of 4471 samples. To enhance the evaluation reliability, we integrate expert-informed ground answers into scoring rubrics that guide GPT-4o in annotating responses and generating reference critiques, which serve as anchors for trustworthy judgments. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MM-CRITIC and provide a comprehensive assessment of leading LMMs' critique capabilities under multiple dimensions. Further analysis reveals some key insights, including the correlation between response quality and critique, and varying critique difficulty across evaluation dimensions.

Conclusion: 提出的动态分块框架有效解决了流式识别中的上下文截断问题，在安多藏语语音识别中取得了显著性能提升和延迟降低。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a streaming speech recognition framework for Amdo Tibetan, built upon a hybrid CTC/Atten-tion architecture with a context-aware dynamic chunking mechanism. The proposed strategy adaptively adjusts chunk widths based on encoding states, enabling flexible receptive fields, cross-chunk information exchange, and robust adaptation to varying speaking rates, thereby alleviating the context truncation problem of fixed-chunk methods. To further capture the linguistic characteristics of Tibetan, we construct a lexicon grounded in its orthographic principles, providing linguistically motivated modeling units. During decoding, an external language model is integrated to enhance semantic consistency and improve recognition of long sentences. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves a word error rate (WER) of 6.23% on the test set, yielding a 48.15% relative improvement over the fixed-chunk baseline, while significantly reducing recognition latency and maintaining performance close to global decoding.

Conclusion: Bi-RAR通过双向评估和强化学习优化，显著提升了检索增强生成在多步推理任务中的性能，为复杂推理场景提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven to be effective in mitigating hallucinations in large language models, yet its effectiveness remains limited in complex, multi-step reasoning scenarios.Recent efforts have incorporated search-based interactions into RAG, enabling iterative reasoning with real-time retrieval. Most approaches rely on outcome-based supervision, offering no explicit guidance for intermediate steps. This often leads to reward hacking and degraded response quality. We propose Bi-RAR, a novel retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that evaluates each intermediate step jointly in both forward and backward directions. To assess the information completeness of each step, we introduce a bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity, approximated via language model generation probabilities. This quantification measures both how far the current reasoning is from the answer and how well it addresses the question. To optimize reasoning under these bidirectional signals, we adopt a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework with a cascading reward structure that emphasizes early trajectory alignment. Empirical results on seven question answering benchmarks demonstrate that Bi-RAR surpasses previous methods and enables efficient interaction and reasoning with the search engine during training and inference.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过日本即兴喜剧游戏Oogiri系统评估LLMs的幽默能力，发现LLMs在生成幽默内容方面达到中低水平人类表现，但缺乏共情能力，且评估标准与人类存在根本差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对LLMs幽默能力的评估过于单一，仅关注是否"有趣"，需要从多维度理解幽默，特别是通过Oogiri这种即兴喜剧形式来系统评估。

Method: 扩展Oogiri数据集并加入LLMs生成的回应，手动标注6个维度的5分制评分（新颖性、清晰度、相关性、智能性、共情性、整体趣味性），评估LLMs在生成和评估幽默方面的能力。

Result: LLMs能生成中低水平人类表现的幽默内容，但显著缺乏共情能力；LLMs评估幽默时优先考虑新颖性，而人类优先考虑共情性。

Conclusion: LLMs在幽默理解和生成方面存在共情缺陷，这限制了其复制人类幽默评估的能力，发布标注语料库以促进更智能对话代理的发展。

Abstract: Computational humor is a frontier for creating advanced and engaging natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as sophisticated dialogue systems. While previous studies have benchmarked the humor capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have often relied on single-dimensional evaluations, such as judging whether something is simply ``funny.'' This paper argues that a multifaceted understanding of humor is necessary and addresses this gap by systematically evaluating LLMs through the lens of Oogiri, a form of Japanese improvisational comedy games. To achieve this, we expanded upon existing Oogiri datasets with data from new sources and then augmented the collection with Oogiri responses generated by LLMs. We then manually annotated this expanded collection with 5-point absolute ratings across six dimensions: Novelty, Clarity, Relevance, Intelligence, Empathy, and Overall Funniness. Using this dataset, we assessed the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs on two core tasks: their ability to generate creative Oogiri responses and their ability to evaluate the funniness of responses using a six-dimensional evaluation. Our results show that while LLMs can generate responses at a level between low- and mid-tier human performance, they exhibit a notable lack of Empathy. This deficit in Empathy helps explain their failure to replicate human humor assessment. Correlation analyses of human and model evaluation data further reveal a fundamental divergence in evaluation criteria: LLMs prioritize Novelty, whereas humans prioritize Empathy. We release our annotated corpus to the community to pave the way for the development of more emotionally intelligent and sophisticated conversational agents.

Abstract: Personalized learning has gained attention in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) education, where engagement and motivation play crucial roles in reading comprehension. We propose a novel approach to generating personalized English reading comprehension tests tailored to students' interests. We develop a structured content transcreation pipeline using OpenAI's gpt-4o, where we start with the RACE-C dataset, and generate new passages and multiple-choice reading comprehension questions that are linguistically similar to the original passages but semantically aligned with individual learners' interests. Our methodology integrates topic extraction, question classification based on Bloom's taxonomy, linguistic feature analysis, and content transcreation to enhance student engagement. We conduct a controlled experiment with EFL learners in South Korea to examine the impact of interest-aligned reading materials on comprehension and motivation. Our results show students learning with personalized reading passages demonstrate improved comprehension and motivation retention compared to those learning with non-personalized materials.

Motivation: Transformer模型中的旋转位置嵌入(RoPE)存在固有的长度外推限制，导致注意力下沉现象，影响模型在长序列上的表现。

Method: 将带位置编码的注意力图重新解释为噪声特征图，基于截断矩阵熵检测异常频率带，并使用参数自由的高斯分布重新参数化特征图以实现鲁棒外推。

Result: 在needle-in-a-haystack和many-shot in-context learning任务中，DoPE在长达64K token的扩展上下文中显著提高了检索准确性和推理稳定性。

Conclusion: 对位置嵌入的去噪策略有效缓解了注意力下沉现象，恢复了平衡的注意力模式，为改进长度泛化提供了简单而强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) in Transformer models has inherent limits that weaken length extrapolation. We reinterpret the attention map with positional encoding as a noisy feature map, and propose Denoising Positional Encoding (DoPE), a training-free method based on truncated matrix entropy to detect outlier frequency bands in the feature map. Leveraging the noise characteristics of the feature map, we further reparameterize it with a parameter-free Gaussian distribution to achieve robust extrapolation. Our method theoretically reveals the underlying cause of the attention sink phenomenon and its connection to truncated matrix entropy. Experiments on needle-in-a-haystack and many-shot in-context learning tasks demonstrate that DoPE significantly improves retrieval accuracy and reasoning stability across extended contexts (up to 64K tokens). The results show that the denoising strategy for positional embeddings effectively mitigates attention sinks and restores balanced attention patterns, providing a simple yet powerful solution for improving length generalization.

Conclusion: 闭环自精炼数据管道可以显著增强LLMs的工具使用能力，证明了在成本效益高的开源生态系统中实现高效工具学习的可行性。

Abstract: Augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools enables them to execute complex, multi-step tasks. However, tool learning is hampered by the static synthetic data pipelines where data generation and model training are executed as two separate, non-interactive processes. This approach fails to adaptively focus on a model's specific weaknesses and allows noisy labels to persist, degrading training efficiency. We introduce LoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures. This closed-loop process operates within a cost-effective, open-source ecosystem, eliminating dependence on expensive closed-source APIs. Experiments show that our 8B model trained with LoopTool significantly surpasses its 32B data generator and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the BFCL-v3 and ACEBench benchmarks for its scale. Our work demonstrates that closed-loop, self-refining data pipelines can dramatically enhance the tool-use capabilities of LLMs.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了表格结构理解问题，未来计划集成更高效的文本搜索模型来缩小与人类评估的差距。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining increased attention in the domain of Table Question Answering (TQA), particularly for extracting information from tables in documents. However, directly entering entire tables as long text into LLMs often leads to incorrect answers because most LLMs cannot inherently capture complex table structures. In this paper, we propose a cell extraction method for TQA without manual identification, even for complex table headers. Our approach estimates table headers by computing similarities between a given question and individual cells via a hybrid retrieval mechanism that integrates a language model and TF-IDF. We then select as the answer the cells at the intersection of the most relevant row and column. Furthermore, the language model is trained using contrastive learning on a small dataset of question-header pairs to enhance performance. We evaluated our approach in the TQA dataset from the U4 shared task at NTCIR-18. The experimental results show that our pipeline achieves an accuracy of 74.6\%, outperforming existing LLMs such as GPT-4o mini~(63.9\%). In the future, although we used traditional encoder models for retrieval in this study, we plan to incorporate more efficient text-search models to improve performance and narrow the gap with human evaluation results.

Conclusion: 支持使用基于上下文的sequentiality作为经过验证、可解释且互补的特征，用于自动作文评分及相关NLP任务。

Abstract: Recent work has proposed using Large Language Models (LLMs) to quantify narrative flow through a measure called sequentiality, which combines topic and contextual terms. A recent critique argued that the original results were confounded by how topics were selected for the topic-based component, and noted that the metric had not been validated against ground-truth measures of flow. That work proposed using only the contextual term as a more conceptually valid and interpretable alternative. In this paper, we empirically validate that proposal. Using two essay datasets with human-annotated trait scores, ASAP++ and ELLIPSE, we show that the contextual version of sequentiality aligns more closely with human assessments of discourse-level traits such as Organization and Cohesion. While zero-shot prompted LLMs predict trait scores more accurately than the contextual measure alone, the contextual measure adds more predictive value than both the topic-only and original sequentiality formulations when combined with standard linguistic features. Notably, this combination also outperforms the zero-shot LLM predictions, highlighting the value of explicitly modeling sentence-to-sentence flow. Our findings support the use of context-based sequentiality as a validated, interpretable, and complementary feature for automated essay scoring and related NLP tasks.

Motivation: 传统子词分割通常在预处理阶段固定，本研究旨在探索如果语言模型能够动态优化分词，其子词在训练过程中如何演化，特别关注形态复杂语言的优化潜力。

Method: 扩展子词分段语言模型框架，支持预训练和微调，选取三种形态类型语言：粘着性的isi-Xhosa、分析性的Setswana和中间类型的英语，从语言学角度分析子词动态变化。

Result: 识别出子词学习的四个阶段，形态复杂的isi-Xhosa表现出更大不稳定性；微调过程中子词边界变得更细粒度；可学习子词能提升低资源形态复杂语言的文本生成和跨语言迁移能力。

Conclusion: 可学习子词为低资源、形态复杂语言提供了有前景的优化途径，子词分割的动态学习机制能够根据训练目标自适应调整分词策略。

Abstract: Subword segmentation is typically applied in preprocessing and stays fixed during training. Alternatively, it can be learned during training to optimise the training objective. In this paper we study the learning dynamics of subword segmentation: if a language model can dynamically optimise tokenisation, how do its subwords evolve during pretraining and finetuning? To explore this, we extend the subword segmental language model (SSLM), a framework for learning subwords during training, to support pretraining and finetuning. We train models for three typologically diverse languages to study learning dynamics across the morphological spectrum: Isi-Xhosa is conjunctive (long word forms composed of many morphemes), Setswana is disjunctive (morphemes written as separate words), and English represents a typological middle ground. We analyse subword dynamics from a linguistic perspective, tracking morphology, productivity, and fertility. We identify four stages of subword learning, with the morphologically complex isi-Xhosa exhibiting greater instability. During finetuning, subword boundaries shift to become finer-grained. Lastly, we show that learnable subwords offers a promising approach to improve text generation and cross-lingual transfer for low-resource, morphologically complex languages.

TL;DR: 本文提出Anchor方法，通过将真实轨迹注入rollouts来防止早期训练崩溃，显著提升语言模型在可验证推理任务中的稳定性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在优化最终任务结果时，容易在早期训练中因负奖励主导而崩溃，特别是在诚实对齐任务中，模型需要既能回答可解答问题，也能识别无法从前提得出结论的情况。

Method: 提出Anchor强化学习方法，将真实轨迹注入rollouts以防止早期训练崩溃；使用基于图结构的两个多步演绎推理数据集（线性代数和逻辑推理），其中一半实例通过随机扰动边来创建不可解答案例。

Result: Anchor方法稳定了学习过程，显著提高了整体推理性能；相比之下，GRPO方法（无论是否有监督微调初始化）在这些任务上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 训练动态对于在已对齐语言模型中实现可靠演绎推理至关重要，Anchor方法通过防止早期崩溃有效解决了诚实对齐中的稳定性问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a promising framework for aligning language models with complex reasoning objectives. However, most existing methods optimize only for final task outcomes, leaving models vulnerable to collapse when negative rewards dominate early training. This challenge is especially pronounced in honesty alignment, where models must not only solve answerable queries but also identify when conclusions cannot be drawn from the given premises. Deductive reasoning provides an ideal testbed because it isolates reasoning capability from reliance on external factual knowledge. To investigate honesty alignment, we curate two multi-step deductive reasoning datasets from graph structures, one for linear algebra and one for logical inference, and introduce unanswerable cases by randomly perturbing an edge in half of the instances. We find that GRPO, with or without supervised fine tuning initialization, struggles on these tasks. Through extensive experiments across three models, we evaluate stabilization strategies and show that curriculum learning provides some benefit but requires carefully designed in distribution datasets with controllable difficulty. To address these limitations, we propose Anchor, a reinforcement learning method that injects ground truth trajectories into rollouts, preventing early training collapse. Our results demonstrate that this method stabilizes learning and significantly improves the overall reasoning performance, underscoring the importance of training dynamics for enabling reliable deductive reasoning in aligned language models.

TL;DR: POTSA是一个基于跨语言平行语音对和最优传输的新框架，旨在弥合高资源和低资源语言之间的翻译差距，通过偏置补偿模块和令牌级OT约束来改善语音大语言模型的多语言语音到文本翻译性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语音大语言模型在多语言语音到文本翻译中往往忽略源语言之间的语义共性，导致翻译性能存在偏差，特别是在高资源和低资源语言之间存在性能差距。

Method: 1. 引入偏置补偿模块粗略对齐跨语言的初始语音表示；2. 在Q-Former上施加令牌级最优传输约束，使用平行语音对建立细粒度表示一致性；3. 应用层调度策略将OT约束集中在最具语义益处的层上。

Result: 在FLEURS数据集上的实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的性能：在五种常见语言上平均BLEU提升+0.93，在零样本语言上BLEU提升+5.05，每个源语言仅使用10小时的平行语音数据。

Conclusion: POTSA框架通过结合偏置补偿和最优传输约束，有效改善了语音大语言模型在多语言语音到文本翻译中的性能，特别是在弥合高资源和低资源语言翻译差距方面表现出色。

Abstract: Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have achieved breakthroughs in multilingual speech-to-text translation (S2TT). However, existing approaches often overlook semantic commonalities across source languages, leading to biased translation performance. In this work, we propose \textbf{POTSA} (Parallel Optimal Transport for Speech Alignment), a new framework based on cross-lingual parallel speech pairs and Optimal Transport (OT), designed to bridge high- and low-resource translation gaps. First, we introduce a Bias Compensation module to coarsely align initial speech representations across languages. Second, we impose token-level OT constraints on a Q-Former using parallel speech pairs to establish fine-grained consistency of representations. Then, we apply a layer scheduling strategy to focus OT constraints on the most semantically beneficial layers. Experiments on the FLEURS dataset show that our method achieves SOTA performance, with +0.93 BLEU on average over five common languages and +5.05 BLEU on zero-shot languages, using only 10 hours of parallel speech per source language.

*Yu Li,Zhe Yang,Yi Huang,Xin Liu,Guilin Qi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: C$^3$TG是一个两阶段框架，用于细粒度、多维度的文本属性控制，通过选择性配对LLM与属性分类器，结合加权KL散度和能量函数优化，解决属性冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以精确控制多个文本属性，特别是在属性冲突时缺乏协调机制，且无法在生成过程中进行迭代优化。

Method: 提出C$^3$TG框架：生成阶段使用加权KL散度调整token概率，优化阶段通过能量函数结合分类器分数和惩罚项进行迭代反馈。

Result: 实验表明C$^3$TG在属性准确性、语言流畅性和输出多样性等多个指标上显著优于基线方法，同时降低了毒性。

Conclusion: C$^3$TG是一种无需昂贵模型修改的有效灵活的多维文本属性控制解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable text generation capabilities. However, controlling specific attributes of generated text remains challenging without architectural modifications or extensive fine-tuning. Current methods typically toggle a single, basic attribute but struggle with precise multi-attribute control. In scenarios where attribute requirements conflict, existing methods lack coordination mechanisms, causing interference between desired attributes. Furthermore, these methods fail to incorporate iterative optimization processes in the controlled generation pipeline. To address these limitations, we propose Conflict-aware, Composite, and Collaborative Controlled Text Generation (C$^3$TG), a two-phase framework for fine-grained, multi-dimensional text attribute control. During generation, C$^3$TG selectively pairs the LLM with the required attribute classifiers from the 17 available dimensions and employs weighted KL-divergence to adjust token probabilities. The optimization phase then leverages an energy function combining classifier scores and penalty terms to resolve attribute conflicts through iterative feedback, enabling precise control over multiple dimensions simultaneously while preserving natural text flow. Experiments show that C$^3$TG significantly outperforms baselines across multiple metrics including attribute accuracy, linguistic fluency, and output diversity, while simultaneously reducing toxicity. These results establish C$^3$TG as an effective and flexible solution for multi-dimensional text attribute control that requires no costly model modifications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了LiteraryTaste数据集，包含60人的阅读偏好数据，用于开发个性化创意写作LLM。研究发现人们创意写作偏好存在差异，微调transformer编码器可有效建模个人和集体偏好，但自述偏好对建模实际偏好的效用有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人们有不同的创意写作偏好，而现有的LLM通常将不同个人品味视为整体进行训练，需要开发能够适应每个用户偏好的个性化创意写作模型。

Method: 引入LiteraryTaste数据集，包含60人的阅读习惯和品味自述（陈述偏好）以及对100对短创意写作文本的偏好标注（显示偏好）。使用transformer编码器进行微调来建模偏好。

Result: 1）人们在创意写作偏好上存在分歧；2）微调transformer编码器在建模个人和集体显示偏好时分别达到75.8%和67.7%的准确率；3）陈述偏好在建模显示偏好方面效用有限。

Conclusion: 该工作为个性化创意写作技术奠定了基础，通过LLM驱动的可解释性管道分析了人们偏好的变化方式。

Abstract: People have different creative writing preferences, and large language models (LLMs) for these tasks can benefit from adapting to each user's preferences. However, these models are often trained over a dataset that considers varying personal tastes as a monolith. To facilitate developing personalized creative writing LLMs, we introduce LiteraryTaste, a dataset of reading preferences from 60 people, where each person: 1) self-reported their reading habits and tastes (stated preference), and 2) annotated their preferences over 100 pairs of short creative writing texts (revealed preference). With our dataset, we found that: 1) people diverge on creative writing preferences, 2) finetuning a transformer encoder could achieve 75.8% and 67.7% accuracy when modeling personal and collective revealed preferences, and 3) stated preferences had limited utility in modeling revealed preferences. With an LLM-driven interpretability pipeline, we analyzed how people's preferences vary. We hope our work serves as a cornerstone for personalizing creative writing technologies.

Conclusion: 成功开发了可解释的高棉语极性分类器，并贡献了公开可用的高棉语极性数据集和微调模型。

Abstract: Khmer polarity classification is a fundamental natural language processing task that assigns a positive, negative, or neutral label to a given Khmer text input. Existing Khmer models typically predict the label without explaining the rationale behind the prediction. This paper proposes an explainable Khmer polarity classifier by fine-tuning an instruction-based reasoning Qwen-3 model. The notion of explainability in this paper is limited to self-explanations, which the model uses to rationalize its predictions. Experimental results show that the fine-tuned model not only predicts labels accurately but also provides reasoning by identifying polarity-related keywords or phrases to support its predictions. In addition, we contribute a new Khmer polarity dataset consisting of short- to medium-length casual, romanized, and mixed-code Khmer expressions. This dataset was constructed using both heuristic rules and human curation and is publicly available through a gated Hugging Face repository (rinabuoy/khmerpolarity_nonreasoning). The fine-tuned Qwen-3 models are also made available in the same Hugging Face account.

TL;DR: 提出AdaptDel方法，使用可适应删除率来改进序列分类在编辑距离扰动下的认证鲁棒性，在自然语言任务中显著提升认证区域的中位数基数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用固定删除率处理不同长度的自然输入（如句子）导致性能不佳，需要动态调整删除率以适应输入特性。

Method: 引入AdaptDel方法，具有可适应删除率，基于输入属性动态调整，并将随机平滑理论框架扩展到可变率删除。

Result: 在自然语言任务中取得强实证结果，认证区域的中位数基数相比最先进认证方法提升高达30个数量级。

Conclusion: AdaptDel方法通过动态调整删除率，显著提升了序列分类在编辑距离扰动下的认证鲁棒性性能。

Abstract: We consider the problem of certified robustness for sequence classification against edit distance perturbations. Naturally occurring inputs of varying lengths (e.g., sentences in natural language processing tasks) present a challenge to current methods that employ fixed-rate deletion mechanisms and lead to suboptimal performance. To this end, we introduce AdaptDel methods with adaptable deletion rates that dynamically adjust based on input properties. We extend the theoretical framework of randomized smoothing to variable-rate deletion, ensuring sound certification with respect to edit distance. We achieve strong empirical results in natural language tasks, observing up to 30 orders of magnitude improvement to median cardinality of the certified region, over state-of-the-art certifications.

*Arka Mukherjee,Shreya Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了mmJEE-Eval多模态双语基准，基于印度JEE Advanced考试题目，用于评估视觉语言模型的科学推理能力。评估发现前沿模型表现优异但开源模型表现不佳，且模型在元认知推理任务中表现崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态推理基准无法充分区分真正的科学推理能力与模式匹配，需要更具挑战性的基准来评估模型的实际推理能力。

Method: 构建包含1,460道JEE Advanced考题的多模态双语基准，涵盖物理、化学、数学领域，评估17个最先进模型在推理、元认知等方面的表现。

Result: 前沿VLMs在2025年考题上达到77-84%准确率，开源模型仅37-45%准确率；封闭模型在元认知推理中表现崩溃（GPT-5仅修正5.2%错误）。

Conclusion: mmJEE-Eval能有效区分不同训练和推理方法的质量，其难度源于复杂性和推理深度而非记忆，为评估科学推理能力提供了更可靠的基准。

Abstract: Contemporary vision-language models (VLMs) perform well on existing multimodal reasoning benchmarks (78-85\% accuracy on MMMU, MathVista). Yet, these results fail to sufficiently distinguish true scientific reasoning articulation capabilities from pattern-matching. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{mmJEE-Eval}, a multimodal bilingual (English and Hindi) benchmark comprising 1,460 questions from India's JEE Advanced examination (2019-2025) spanning pre-college Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics domains. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art models reveals that while frontier VLMs (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash) achieve 77-84\% accuracy on held-out 2025 questions, open-source models plateau at 37-45\% despite scaling to 400B parameters, a significant difference not observed on existing benchmarks. While closed frontiers from Google and OpenAI show high problem-solving accuracies (up to 100\% pass@3 scores), they fully collapse when the reasoning load is increased meta-cognitively (GPT-5 fixes just 5.2\% errors). Systematic ablations show mmJEE-Eval's difficulty stems from complexity and reasoning depth rather than memorization. Effectively, our benchmark segregates superior training and reasoning methodologies where alternatives fail. We publicly release our code and data: https://mmjee-eval.github.io

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SeerSC是一个动态自一致性框架，通过整合系统1和系统2推理，同时提高令牌效率和降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时缩放能提升LLM推理性能但计算成本高，现有动态自一致性方法受限于顺序请求的高延迟。

Method: 利用快速系统1计算答案熵来评估样本缩放潜力，在系统2下实现动态自一致性，通过并行生成降低延迟。

Result: 令牌消耗减少47%，推理延迟降低43%，且无显著性能损失。

Conclusion: SeerSC在保持性能的同时显著提高了令牌效率和推理速度。

Abstract: Test-time scaling improves the inference performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) but also incurs substantial computational costs. Although recent studies have reduced token consumption through dynamic self-consistency, they remain constrained by the high latency of sequential requests. In this paper, we propose SeerSC, a dynamic self-consistency framework that simultaneously improves token efficiency and latency by integrating System 1 and System 2 reasoning. Specifically, we utilize the rapid System 1 to compute the answer entropy for given queries. This score is then used to evaluate the potential of samples for scaling, enabling dynamic self-consistency under System 2. Benefiting from the advance and accurate estimation provided by System 1, the proposed method can reduce token usage while simultaneously achieving a significant decrease in latency through parallel generation. It outperforms existing methods, achieving up to a 47% reduction in token consumption and a 43% reduction in inference latency without significant performance loss.

TL;DR: 提出了Spider4SSC数据集和S2CLite解析工具，这是一个轻量级的、与本体无关的解析器，可将SPARQL查询转换为Cypher查询，在BSBM42和Spider4SPARQL数据集上的实验显示其解析准确率显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SPARQL到Cypher转换解决方案存在局限性，需要RDF图或外部工具支持。作者旨在开发一个轻量级、规则基础的解析器，无需依赖外部资源即可实现高效转换。

Method: S2CLite是一个纯基于规则的解析器，灵感来自传统编程语言编译器，无需RDF图或外部工具即可将SPARQL查询转换为Cypher查询。

Result: 在Spider4SPARQL数据集上，S2CLite的总解析准确率达到77.8%，显著优于最先进的S2CTrans的44.2%。在两者都能解析的查询子集上，S2CLite的执行准确率达到96.6%，比S2CTrans高出7.3%。

Conclusion: S2CLite是一个高效、轻量级的SPARQL到Cypher转换工具，显著提升了转换准确率，并生成了统一的Text-to-Query数据集Spider4SSC，为多语言查询转换研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: We present Spider4SSC dataset and S2CLite parsing tool. S2CLite is a lightweight, ontology-agnostic parser that translates SPARQL queries into Cypher queries, enabling both in-situ and large-scale SPARQL to Cypher translation. Unlike existing solutions, S2CLite is purely rule-based (inspired by traditional programming language compilers) and operates without requiring an RDF graph or external tools. Experiments conducted on the BSBM42 and Spider4SPARQL datasets show that S2CLite significantly reduces query parsing errors, achieving a total parsing accuracy of 77.8% on Spider4SPARQL compared to 44.2% by the state-of-the-art S2CTrans. Furthermore, S2CLite achieved a 96.6\% execution accuracy on the intersecting subset of queries parsed by both parsers, outperforming S2CTrans by 7.3%. We further use S2CLite to parse Spider4SPARQL queries to Cypher and generate Spider4SSC, a unified Text-to-Query language (SQL, SPARQL, Cypher) dataset with 4525 unique questions and 3 equivalent sets of 2581 matching queries (SQL, SPARQL and Cypher). We open-source S2CLite for further development on GitHub (github.com/vejvarm/S2CLite) and provide the clean Spider4SSC dataset for download.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在输出评估方面越来越有效，但尚不确定这种能力是否能扩展到更一般的文本质量评估，特别是在多语言环境中。

Method: 首先自动生成文本质量偏好数据，然后使用这些数据训练开源基础大语言模型，使其与高质量和低质量文本的评分对齐。

Result: 在115种语言的综合评估中，提出的模型表现出改进的性能，并且这种增强的评估能力还能显著改善下游任务。

Conclusion: MTQ-Eval框架能够有效评估多语言文本质量，并且这种评估能力的提升对下游任务也有积极影响。

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) for evaluating outputs is becoming an increasingly effective and scalable approach. However, it remains uncertain whether this capability extends beyond task-specific evaluations to more general assessments of text quality, particularly in multilingual contexts. In this study, we introduce, MTQ-Eval, a novel framework for multilingual text quality evaluation that learns from examples of both high- and low-quality texts, adjusting its internal representations. To develop MTQ-Eval, we first automatically generate text quality preference data and then use it to train open-source base LLMs to align with ratings of high- and low-quality text. Our comprehensive evaluation across 115 languages demonstrates the improved performance of the proposed model. Upon further analysis, we find that this enhanced evaluation capability also leads to notable improvements in downstream tasks.

Method: 通过系统实验比较不同规模和家族的语言模型在各种自然语言理解和推理任务中的表现趋势和错误修正行为。

Conclusion: 自我修正机制的设计应考虑任务结构与输出空间的相互作用，这对知识密集型推理和决策导向的LLM应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated remarkable abilities to self-correct their responses through iterative refinement, often referred to as self-consistency or self-reflection. However, the dynamics of this self-correction mechanism may differ substantially depending on whether the model is tasked with open-ended text generation or with selecting the most appropriate response from multiple predefined options. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation of these two paradigms by comparing performance trends and error-correction behaviors across various natural language understanding and reasoning tasks, covering language models of different scales and families. Our experimental results reveal distinct patterns of improvement and failure modes:
  \textit{While open-ended generation often benefits from the flexibility of re-interpretation and compositional refinement, multiple-choice selection can leverage clearer solution boundaries but may be limited by the provided options}. This contrast also reflects the dual demands faced by emerging agentic LLM applications: effective agents must not only generate and refine open-ended plans or explanations, but also make reliable discrete choices when operating within constrained action spaces. Our findings, therefore, highlight that the design of self-correction mechanisms should take into account the interaction between task structure and output space, with implications for both knowledge-intensive reasoning and decision-oriented applications of LLMs.

Motivation: 当前离线偏好优化方法存在过拟合-欠拟合困境：对正确排序样本施加过多梯度（过拟合），对错误排序样本提供不足修正信号（欠拟合），限制了排序准确性的提升。

Method: 提出AMaPO算法，采用基于Z归一化和指数缩放的实例级自适应边距，动态重新分配学习努力：放大错误排序样本的梯度，抑制正确排序样本的梯度。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中，AMaPO不仅实现了更好的排序准确性和优越的下游对齐性能，还成功缓解了核心的过拟合和欠拟合问题。

Conclusion: AMaPO通过自适应边距设计有效解决了离线偏好优化中的过拟合-欠拟合困境，为语言模型对齐提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Offline preference optimization offers a simpler and more stable alternative to RLHF for aligning language models. However, their effectiveness is critically dependent on ranking accuracy, a metric where further gains are highly impactful. This limitation arises from a fundamental problem that we identify and formalize as the Overfitting-Underfitting Dilemma: current margin designs cause models to apply excessive, wasteful gradients to correctly ranked samples (overfitting) while providing insufficient corrective signals for misranked ones (underfitting). To resolve this dilemma, we propose Adaptive Margin-attached Preference Optimization (AMaPO), a simple yet principled algorithm. AMaPO employs an instance-wise adaptive margin, refined by Z-normalization and exponential scaling, which dynamically reallocates learning effort by amplifying gradients for misranked samples and suppressing them for correct ones. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that AMaPO not only achieves better ranking accuracy and superior downstream alignment performance, but targeted analysis also confirms that it successfully mitigates the core overfitting and underfitting issues.

Motivation: 当前商业多模态大语言模型在低资源语言上表现尚可，但开源社区尚未达到同等水平，因此需要为低资源语言巴斯克语开发强大的多模态大语言模型。

Method: 创建了专门的训练和评估图像-文本数据集，使用Llama-3.1-Instruct和巴斯克语适配的Latxa模型作为骨干，探索了不同的数据混合训练策略。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发其他低资源语言的多模态大语言模型开辟了道路，并公开释放了相关资源。

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models exhibit very strong performance for several demanding tasks. While commercial MLLMs deliver acceptable performance in low-resource languages, comparable results remain unattained within the open science community. In this paper, we aim to develop a strong MLLM for a low-resource language, namely Basque. For that purpose, we develop our own training and evaluation image-text datasets. Using two different Large Language Models as backbones, the Llama-3.1-Instruct model and a Basque-adapted variant called Latxa, we explore several data mixtures for training. We show that: i) low ratios of Basque multimodal data (around 20%) are already enough to obtain solid results on Basque benchmarks, and ii) contrary to expected, a Basque instructed backbone LLM is not required to obtain a strong MLLM in Basque. Our results pave the way to develop MLLMs for other low-resource languages by openly releasing our resources.

Conclusion: 研究为开发更全面、通用和有效的心理咨询模型提供了方向，CARE-Bench能够更准确地评估模型处理多样复杂客户的能力。

Abstract: The mismatch between the growing demand for psychological counseling and the limited availability of services has motivated research into the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this domain. Consequently, there is a need for a robust and unified benchmark to assess the counseling competence of various LLMs. Existing works, however, are limited by unprofessional client simulation, static question-and-answer evaluation formats, and unidimensional metrics. These limitations hinder their effectiveness in assessing a model's comprehensive ability to handle diverse and complex clients. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{CARE-Bench}, a dynamic and interactive automated benchmark. It is built upon diverse client profiles derived from real-world counseling cases and simulated according to expert guidelines. CARE-Bench provides a multidimensional performance evaluation grounded in established psychological scales. Using CARE-Bench, we evaluate several general-purpose LLMs and specialized counseling models, revealing their current limitations. In collaboration with psychologists, we conduct a detailed analysis of the reasons for LLMs' failures when interacting with clients of different types, which provides directions for developing more comprehensive, universal, and effective counseling models.

Motivation: 机器学习研究发展迅速，从科学出版物中提取信息能够大规模识别研究概念和资源，有助于提高对ML相关研究的理解和可复现性。需要细粒度数据集来提取和连接ML研究中的详细信息，如方法训练和数据使用。

Method: 引入GSAP-ERE数据集，这是一个手动整理的细粒度数据集，包含10种实体类型和18种语义分类的关系类型，从100篇ML出版物的全文中提取了63K实体提及和35K关系。使用该数据集微调模型进行信息提取，并作为测试套件探索LLM的提示策略。

Result: 微调模型在命名实体识别(NER)和关系提取(RE)任务上表现优异(NER: 80.6%, RE: 54.0%)，而最先进的LLM提示方法性能较差(NER: 44.4%, RE: 10.1%)。该数据集能够支持知识图谱构建和大规模AI研究可复现性监控。

Conclusion: 监督模型与无监督LLM使用之间的性能差异表明，需要像GSAP-ERE这样的数据集来推进学术信息提取领域的研究。该数据集为细粒度信息提取提供了重要资源，有助于改善ML研究的理解和可复现性。

Abstract: Research in Machine Learning (ML) and AI evolves rapidly. Information Extraction (IE) from scientific publications enables to identify information about research concepts and resources on a large scale and therefore is a pathway to improve understanding and reproducibility of ML-related research. To extract and connect fine-grained information in ML-related research, e.g. method training and data usage, we introduce GSAP-ERE. It is a manually curated fine-grained dataset with 10 entity types and 18 semantically categorized relation types, containing mentions of 63K entities and 35K relations from the full text of 100 ML publications. We show that our dataset enables fine-tuned models to automatically extract information relevant for downstream tasks ranging from knowledge graph (KG) construction, to monitoring the computational reproducibility of AI research at scale. Additionally, we use our dataset as a test suite to explore prompting strategies for IE using Large Language Models (LLM). We observe that the performance of state-of-the-art LLM prompting methods is largely outperformed by our best fine-tuned baseline model (NER: 80.6%, RE: 54.0% for the fine-tuned model vs. NER: 44.4%, RE: 10.1% for the LLM). This disparity of performance between supervised models and unsupervised usage of LLMs suggests datasets like GSAP-ERE are needed to advance research in the domain of scholarly information extraction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从大量生成文本中预测个体人格特质具有挑战性，特别是当文本量很大时，需要解决输入文本限制问题。

Conclusion: TPoT是一种简单有效的策略，能够通过语义文本选择来提升人格特质预测性能。

Abstract: Predicting an individual's personalities from their generated texts is a challenging task, especially when the text volume is large. In this paper, we introduce a straightforward yet effective novel strategy called targeted preselection of texts (TPoT). This method semantically filters the texts as input to a deep learning model, specifically designed to predict a Big Five personality trait, facet, or item, referred to as the BIG5-TPoT model. By selecting texts that are semantically relevant to a particular trait, facet, or item, this strategy not only addresses the issue of input text limits in large language models but also improves the Mean Absolute Error and accuracy metrics in predictions for the Stream of Consciousness Essays dataset.

### [124] [Readability Measures and Automatic Text Simplification: In the Search of a Construct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09536)
*Rémi Cardon,A. Seza Doğruöz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了自动文本简化(ATS)中可读性度量与自动评估指标及人工判断之间的相关性，发现在英语ATS中，可读性度量与自动指标和人工判断的相关性普遍较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在信息爆炸时代，可读性是关键概念。虽然已有研究关注ATS中自动评估指标与人工判断的相关性，但可读性度量（如可读性公式或语言特征）与这两者的相关性尚未得到足够关注。

Method: 首先讨论ATS与可读性研究的关系，然后报告一项关于可读性度量与人工判断之间、以及可读性度量与ATS评估指标之间相关性的研究。

Result: 研究发现，可读性度量通常与自动指标和人工判断的相关性不高。三个不同评估角度之间的相关性较低。

Conclusion: 由于从三个不同角度评估简化的相关性较低，ATS领域需要明确定义其构造概念。

Abstract: Readability is a key concept in the current era of abundant written information. To help making texts more readable and make information more accessible to everyone, a line of researched aims at making texts accessible for their target audience: automatic text simplification (ATS). Lately, there have been studies on the correlations between automatic evaluation metrics in ATS and human judgment. However, the correlations between those two aspects and commonly available readability measures (such as readability formulas or linguistic features) have not been the focus of as much attention. In this work, we investigate the place of readability measures in ATS by complementing the existing studies on evaluation metrics and human judgment, on English. We first discuss the relationship between ATS and research in readability, then we report a study on correlations between readability measures and human judgment, and between readability measures and ATS evaluation metrics. We identify that in general, readability measures do not correlate well with automatic metrics and human judgment. We argue that as the three different angles from which simplification can be assessed tend to exhibit rather low correlations with one another, there is a need for a clear definition of the construct in ATS.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SynClaimEval框架用于评估长上下文声明验证中合成数据的效用，涵盖输入特征、合成逻辑和解释质量三个维度。实验表明长上下文合成能提升基础指令调优模型的验证能力，特别是增强现有人类编写数据集时，还能提高解释质量。

Method: 引入SynClaimEval框架，从三个维度评估合成数据效用：(i)输入特征：变化上下文长度并测试对域外基准的泛化；(ii)合成逻辑：控制声明复杂度和错误类型变化；(iii)解释质量：测量模型解释与预测一致性的程度。

Result: 跨基准实验显示，长上下文合成能提升基础指令调优模型的验证能力，特别是在增强现有人类编写数据集时。合成还能提高解释质量，即使验证分数没有改善。

Conclusion: 长上下文合成数据在声明验证任务中具有潜力，不仅能提升性能，还能增强可解释性，为幻觉检测和事实核查提供更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with extended context windows promise direct reasoning over long documents, reducing the need for chunking or retrieval. Constructing annotated resources for training and evaluation, however, remains costly. Synthetic data offers a scalable alternative, and we introduce SynClaimEval, a framework for evaluating synthetic data utility in long-context claim verification -- a task central to hallucination detection and fact-checking. Our framework examines three dimensions: (i) input characteristics, by varying context length and testing generalization to out-of-domain benchmarks; (ii) synthesis logic, by controlling claim complexity and error type variation; and (iii) explanation quality, measuring the degree to which model explanations provide evidence consistent with predictions. Experiments across benchmarks show that long-context synthesis can improve verification in base instruction-tuned models, particularly when augmenting existing human-written datasets. Moreover, synthesis enhances explanation quality, even when verification scores do not improve, underscoring its potential to strengthen both performance and explainability.

### [126] [A Particle method for stationary transport equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08774)
*Rafael Bailo,Julie Binard,Pierre Degond,Pascal Noble*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 提出并研究了一种用于求解一类输运方程稳态解的粒子方法，该方法基于非稳态粒子方法，将时间变量替换为空间变量，通过计算粒子轨迹并使用粒子位置作为积分点进行近似。

Method: 基于非稳态粒子方法，将时间变量替换为空间变量，计算粒子轨迹，并使用粒子位置作为积分点进行数值积分近似。

Result: 证明了在适当正则性假设和特征完备性假设下该方法的收敛性，给出了误差估计，并通过二维线性方程和景观演化模型的数值模拟验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效求解输运方程的稳态解，特别适用于处理景观演化模型中的湿/干区域问题，具有理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: We present and study a Particle method for the stationary solutions of a class of transport equations. This method is inspired by non-stationary Particle methods, the time variable being replaced by one spatial variable. Particles trajectories are computed using the ``time-dependent'' equations, and then the approximation is based on a quadrature method using the particle locations as quadrature points. We prove the convergence of the scheme under suitable regularity assumptions on the data and the solution, together with a ``characteristic completeness'' assumption (the characteristic curves fullfill the whole computational domain). We also provide an error estimate. The scheme is tested numerically on a two dimensional linear equation and we present a numerical study of convergence. Finally, we use this method to carry out numerical simulations of a landscape evolution model, where an erodible topography evolves under the effects of water erosion and sedimentation. The scheme is then useful to deal with wet/dry areas.

TL;DR: 提出一种神经预条件牛顿方法，通过固定点神经算子学习从当前迭代到解的映射，有效解决非线性系统求解中的不平衡非线性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统牛顿迭代在面对不平衡非线性时容易出现停滞或不稳定，需要一种能自适应处理强非线性问题的求解方法。

Method: 使用固定点神经算子学习直接映射，通过负步长自适应策略来缓解不平衡非线性的影响，替代传统的线搜索或信赖域算法。

Result: 数值实验表明该方法在多个实际应用中具有计算效率和鲁棒性，特别适用于强非线性问题。

Conclusion: NP-Newton方法通过神经算子有效解决了牛顿迭代在不平衡非线性系统中的问题，为强非线性系统求解提供了高效稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel neural preconditioned Newton (NP-Newton) method for solving parametric nonlinear systems of equations. To overcome the stagnation or instability of Newton iterations caused by unbalanced nonlinearities, we introduce a fixed-point neural operator (FPNO) that learns the direct mapping from the current iterate to the solution by emulating fixed-point iterations. Unlike traditional line-search or trust-region algorithms, the proposed FPNO adaptively employs negative step sizes to effectively mitigate the effects of unbalanced nonlinearities. Through numerical experiments we demonstrate the computational efficiency and robustness of the proposed NP-Newton method across multiple real-world applications, especially for very strong nonlinearities.

### [128] [New perturbation bounds for low rank approximation of matrices via contour analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08875)
*Phuc Tran,Van Vu*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于轮廓分析的新方法来估计噪声矩阵低秩逼近误差，通过引入衡量噪声矩阵与原始矩阵奇异向量之间偏斜度的新参数，在多种常见设置中获得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实际应用中，数据矩阵通常包含噪声，我们只能获得带噪声的数据矩阵。下游任务中使用的是带噪声矩阵的低秩逼近，而非原始矩阵的低秩逼近，因此需要准确估计这两者之间的误差。

Method: 基于轮廓分析的方法，引入新的参数来度量噪声矩阵与原始矩阵奇异向量之间的偏斜度，利用这些参数来获得误差界限的改进。

Result: 该方法在多种流行设置中获得了显著改进，特别是在原始矩阵本身具有相对低秩的情况下效果更好。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法具有独立的研究价值，并有许多进一步的应用前景，特别适用于原始矩阵本身具有低秩特征的常见实践场景。

Abstract: Let $A$ be an $m \times n$ matrix with rank $r$ and spectral decomposition $A = \sum _{i=1}^r σ_i u_i v_i^\top, $ where $σ_i$ are its singular values, ordered decreasingly, and $u_i, v_i$ are the corresponding left and right singular vectors. For a parameter $1 \le p \le r$, $A_p := \sum_{i=1}^p σ_i u_i v_i^\top$ is the best rank $p$ approximation of $A$. In practice, one often chooses $p$ to be small, leading the commonly used phrase "low-rank approximation". Low-rank approximation plays a central role in data science because it can substantially reduce the dimensionality of the original data, the matrix $A$. For a large data matrix $A$, one typically computes a rank-$p$ approximation $A_p$ for a suitably chosen small $p$, stores $A_p$, and uses it as input for further computations. The reduced dimension of $A_p$ enables faster computations and significant data compression. In practice, noise is inevitable. We often have access only to noisy data $\tilde A = A + E$, where $E$ represents the noise. Consequently, the low-rank approximation used as input in many downstream tasks is $\tilde A_p$, the best rank $p$ approximation of $\tilde A$, rather than $A_p$. Therefore, it is natural and important to estimate the error $ \| \tilde A_p - A_p \|$. In this paper, we develop a new method (based on contour analysis) to bound $\| \tilde A_p - A_p \|$. We introduce new parameters that measure the skewness between the noise matrix $E$ and the singular vectors of $A$, and exploit these to obtain notable improvements in many popular settings. This method is of independent interest and has many further applications. We focus on the case where $A$ itself has relatively low rank. This assumption is frequently met in practice, and we think that this case deserves a separate, accessible treatment.

### [129] [Generalized Singular Value Decompositions of Dual Quaternion Matrix Triplets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08885)

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 本文引入了对偶四元数矩阵三元组(𝑨,𝑩,𝑪)的限制SVD和积-积SVD两种广义奇异值分解，用于处理现代工程中的耦合旋转-平移信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代工程中对耦合旋转-平移信号高效处理的需求日益增长，需要发展适用于对偶四元数矩阵的广义奇异值分解工具。

Method: 提出了两种对偶四元数矩阵三元组的广义SVD：限制SVD和积-积SVD，这些分解可视为标准SVD的扩展，其特点在于对行空间和列空间应用不同的内积。

Result: 通过两个示例说明了所提分解方法的可行性。

Conclusion: 所提出的两种广义SVD为处理对偶四元数矩阵提供了一种复杂的矩阵分解方法，能够同时考虑三个对偶四元数矩阵的关系。

Abstract: In signal processing and identification, generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD), related to a sequence of matrices in product/quotient form are essential numerical linear algebra tools. On behalf of the growing demand for efficient processing of coupled rotation-translation signals in modern engineering, we introduce the restricted SVD of a dual quaternion matrix triplet $(\boldsymbol{A},\boldsymbol{B},\boldsymbol{C})$ with $\boldsymbol{A}\in {\bf \mathbb{DQ}}^{m \times n}$, $\boldsymbol{B} \in {\bf \mathbb{DQ}}^{m \times p}$, $\boldsymbol{C} \in {\bf \mathbb{DQ}}^{q\times n}$, and the product-product SVD of a dual quaternion matrix triplet $(\boldsymbol{A},\boldsymbol{B},\boldsymbol{C})$ with $\boldsymbol{A}\in {\bf \mathbb{DQ}}^{m \times n}$, $\boldsymbol{B} \in {\bf \mathbb{DQ}}^{n \times p}$, $\boldsymbol{C} \in {\bf \mathbb{DQ}}^{p\times q}$. The two types of GSVDs represent a sophisticated matrix factorization that accounts for a given dual quaternion matrix in conjunction with two additional dual quaternion matrices. The decompositions can be conceptualized as an adaptation of the standard SVD, where the distinctive feature lies in the application of distinct inner products to the row and column spaces. Two examples are outlined to illustrate the feasibility of the decompositions.

### [130] [A polynomially accelerated fixed-point iteration for vector problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09012)
*Francesco Alemanno*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 提出了一种三点多项式加速器（TPA），通过分析残差动态推断主导收缩因子，并利用最近三个迭代点构建正则化更新，显著加速固定点算法的收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定点算法经常因为某个误差模式衰减过慢而导致收敛停滞，形成残差平台期，需要一种高效且低成本的加速方法来克服这一障碍。

Method: TPA首先从残差动态中直接推断主导收缩因子，然后基于最近三个迭代点构建正则化的三点更新方案，该方案可以轻松集成到现有固定点算法中。

Result: 在线性系统（具有聚集特征值）、非线性tanh映射和离散泊松方程等多种测试中，TPA在达到指定容差时所需的映射评估次数显著少于Picard迭代、加权Jacobi/SOR和浅层Anderson方案。

Conclusion: TPA是一种内存和计算开销极小的有效加速器，能够显著提升固定点算法的收敛性能，同时保持最小的资源占用。

Abstract: Fixed-point procedures frequently slow down because an error mode decays much more slowly than the others, leaving the base iteration with a persistent residual plateau. To counter this obstruction we formulate a three-point polynomial accelerator (TPA) that fits inside existing fixed-point algorithms with negligible modification and computational cost. TPA first infers the dominant contraction factor directly from the residual dynamics and then assembles a regularised three-point update from the last three iterates. We show that across a suite of tests: a linear system with clustered eigenvalues, a nonlinear tanh mapping, and a discretised Poisson equation, TPA attains a prescribed tolerance in markedly fewer map evaluations than Picard iteration, weighted Jacobi/SOR, and shallow Anderson schemes while preserving a minimal memory and arithmetic footprint.

Result: 提出的递归算法适用于更广泛的Birkhoff插值问题，相比依赖高斯消元的现有算法，显著降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: 该方法成功推广了GRPIA算法，为Birkhoff插值问题提供了更高效的计算方案，通过递归方法显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: As a generalization of Hermite interpolation problem, Birkhoff interpolation is an important subject in numerical approximation. This paper generalizes the existing Generalized Recursive Polynomial Interpolation Algorithm (GRPIA) that is used to compute the Hermite interpolation polynomial. Based on the theory of the Schur complement and the Sylvester identity, the proposed recursive algorithms are applicable to a broader class of Birkhoff interpolation problems, where each interpolation condition is given by the composition of an evaluation functional and a differential polynomial. The approach incorporates a judgment condition to ensure the problem's well-posedness and computes a lower-degree Newton-type interpolation basis (which is also a strongly proper interpolation basis) along with the corresponding interpolation polynomial. Compared with existing algorithms that rely on Gaussian elimination to compute the interpolation basis, our recursive approach significantly reduces the computational cost.

Motivation: 解决格点规则中固有的混叠误差问题，提高傅里叶系数估计的精度，实现函数逼近的最优收敛性能。

Method: 使用O((logN)^d)个良好移位，通过最小二乘程序恢复每个傅里叶系数，结合随机移位技术。

Result: 在确定性设置下达到L∞逼近误差的最优收敛率O(N^{-α+1/2+ε})，在随机化设置下达到L2逼近误差的最优收敛率O(N^{-α+ε})。

Conclusion: 该算法在理论和数值实验中都证明了其有效性，为函数逼近问题提供了高效且最优的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for function approximation in a weighted Korobov space based on shifted rank-1 lattice rules. To mitigate aliasing errors inherent in lattice-based Fourier coefficient estimation, we employ $\mathcal{O}((\log N)^{d} )$ good shifts and recover each Fourier coefficient via a least-squares procedure. We show that the resulting approximation achieves the optimal convergence rate for the $L_{\infty}$-approximation error in the worst-case setting, namely $\mathcal{O}(N^{-α+1/2+\varepsilon})$ for arbitrarily small $\varepsilon>0$. Moreover, by incorporating random shifts, the algorithm attains the optimal rate for the $L_{2}$-approximation error in the randomized setting, which is $\mathcal{O}(N^{-α+\varepsilon})$. Numerical experiments are presented to support the theoretical results.

Motivation: 桥接有限体积法和间断Galerkin方法，利用RDG空间在保持局部守恒性的同时获得高阶精度，并建立严格的数学收敛理论。

Method: 采用Petrov-Galerkin框架，以RDG空间作为试探空间，分段常数空间作为检验空间，构建高阶有限体积格式。

Result: 理论分析证明在DG能量范数下获得最优阶收敛，在L2范数下获得次优阶收敛。数值实验验证了方法的精度和效率。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将有限体积法和间断Galerkin方法相结合，为有限体积格式提供了数学上严格的收敛理论支持。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose and analyze a high-order finite volume method for the Poisson problem based on the reduced discontinuous Galerkin (RDG) space. The main idea is to employ the RDG space as the trial space and the piecewise constant space as the test space, thereby formulating the scheme in a Petrov-Galerkin framework. This approach inherits the local conservation property of finite volume methods while benefiting from the approximation capabilities of discontinuous Galerkin spaces with significantly fewer degrees of freedom. We establish a rigorous error analysis of the proposed scheme: in particular, we prove optimal-order convergence in the DG energy norm and suboptimal-order convergence in \(L^2\) norm. The theoretical analysis is supported by a set of one- and two-dimensional numerical experiments with Dirichlet and periodic boundary conditions, which confirm both the accuracy and efficiency of the method. The significance of this work lies in bridging finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin methodologies through the RDG space, thus enabling finite volume schemes with a mathematically rigorous convergence theory.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对无界域上线性反应-扩散方程的自适应拉格朗日有限元方法，通过残差型误差估计器同时考虑离散化误差和截断边界效应，并设计了收敛且达到最优收敛速率的自适应算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无界域上求解反应-扩散方程时，需要引入截断边界将计算限制在有界子域内，这导致了截断误差。现有方法往往只关注离散化误差，而忽略了截断边界的影响。

Method: 提出残差型误差估计器，同时估计离散化误差和截断边界效应；设计自适应算法，自动细化网格并将截断边界推向无穷远。

Result: 证明了误差估计器的可靠性和有效性，自适应算法具有收敛性且达到最优收敛速率，数值实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了无界域问题中截断边界误差的估计和控制问题，为无界域上的偏微分方程数值求解提供了有效的自适应策略。

Abstract: We consider linear reaction-diffusion equations posed on unbounded domains, and discretized by adaptive Lagrange finite elements. To obtain finite-dimensional spaces, it is necessary to introduce a truncation boundary, whereby only a bounded computational subdomain is meshed, leading to an approximation of the solution by zero in the remainder of the domain. We propose a residual-based error estimator that accounts for both the standard discretization error as well as the effect of the truncation boundary. This estimator is shown to be reliable and efficient under appropriate assumptions on the triangulation. Based on this estimator, we devise an adaptive algorithm that automatically refines the mesh and pushes the truncation boundary towards infinity. We prove that this algorithm converges and even achieves optimal rates in terms of the number of degrees of freedom. We finally provide numerical examples illustrating our key theoretical findings.

Abstract: Integrating uncertainties in the design process of reinforced concrete rail bridges, in a fully probabilistic framework, makes their design more complex and challenging. To propagate these uncertainties and convey their influence on the performance of the engineering system, a high-dimensional design space is supposed to be explored. A great challenge to be considered here lies in the computational burden as conducting such an exploration campaign requires substantial calls to computationally expensive finite element simulations. To address this challenge, a surrogate model mapping the design space to the reinforced concrete bridge performance functions is developed in the context of an active learning algorithm. The importance of this model lies in its ability to explore as many design scenarios as possible with minimal computational resources and classify the design scenarios into failure and safe scenarios. This work considers a 4-span reinforced concrete bridge deck. A multi-fiber finite element model of this beam is developed in Cast3m to generate the required design of experiments for the surrogate model. A performance comparison is undertaken to evaluate the Kriging surrogate model effectiveness with and without active learning while the reliability of Kriging predictions is also assessed in comparison to PC-Kriging.

*Liang Luo,Lei Zhang*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 提出一种半收敛阶段式框架，顺序结合一阶和高阶TV正则化，通过ADMM实现图像恢复，在抑制噪声和保留结构间取得更好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 一阶TV能有效保留边缘但会产生阶梯伪影，高阶TV能消除伪影但会过度平滑细节，需要协调这两种竞争效应。

Method: 采用阶段式ADMM框架，每阶段监控半收敛行为，选择局部最优迭代结果作为下一阶段初始点，实现局部半收敛到全局收敛的转换。

Result: 在去噪和去模糊基准测试中，该方法在定量和感知性能上优于传统一阶、高阶、混合TV方法以及基于学习的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持理论可解释性和算法简洁性的同时，实现了优越的图像恢复性能。

Abstract: Image restoration requires a careful balance between noise suppression and structure preservation. While first-order total variation (TV) regularization effectively preserves edges, it often introduces staircase artifacts, whereas higher-order TV removes such artifacts but oversmooths fine details. To reconcile these competing effects, we propose a semi-convergent stage-wise framework that sequentially integrates first- and higher-order TV regularizers within an iterative restoration process implemented via ADMM. Each stage exhibits semi-convergence behavior, i.e., the iterates initially approach the ground truth before being degraded by over-regularization. By monitoring this evolution, the algorithm adaptively selects the locally optimal iterate (e.g., with the highest PSNR) and propagates it as the initial point for the next stage. This select-and-propagate mechanism effectively transfers local semi-convergence into a globally convergent iterative process. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that the sequence of stage-wise iterates is bounded, the objective values decrease monotonically. Extensive numerical experiments on denoising and deblurring benchmarks confirm that the proposed method achieves superior quantitative and perceptual performance compared with conventional first-, higher-order, hybrid TV methods, and learning based methods, while maintaining theoretical interpretability and algorithmic simplicity.

Motivation: 为了在一般非均匀网格上高效求解分数阶拉普拉斯问题，开发快速配置方法以降低计算复杂度和内存需求。

Method: 使用基于快速矩阵-向量乘法的快速配置方案，结合Krylov子空间迭代求解器和带状预处理器，并在特定分级网格上进行误差分析。

Result: 数值实验验证了预测的收敛性，并证明了快速配置方案的高效性，收敛阶数依赖于分级参数。

Conclusion: 该方法在非均匀网格上对α∈(0,1)可唯一求解，在均匀网格上对α∈(0,2)可唯一求解，且通过预处理器进一步提高了计算效率。

Abstract: We propose a fast collocation method based on Krylov subspace iterative solver on general nonuniform grids for the fractional Laplacian problem, in which the fractional operator is presented in a singular integral formulation. The method is proved to be uniquely solvable on general nonuniform grids for $α\in(0,1)$, provided that the sum-of-exponentials (SOE) approximation is sufficiently accurate. In addition, a modified scheme is developed and proved to be uniquely solvable on uniform grids for $α\in(0,2)$. Efficient implementation of the proposed fast collocation schemes based on fast matrix-vector multiplication is carefully discussed, in terms of computational complexity and memory requirement. To further improve computational efficiency, a banded preconditioner is incorporated into the Krylov subspace iterative solver. A rigorous maximum-norm error analysis for $α\in(0,1)$ is presented on specific graded grids, which shows that the convergence order depends on the grading parameter. Numerical experiments validate the predicted convergence and demonstrate the efficiency of the fast collocation schemes.

Abstract: In this study, we employ Euler's method and Richardson's extrapolation to solve a triple integral, which is then transformed into a third-order initial value problem. Our objective is to resolve the computational challenges associated with triple integration by transforming it into an initial value problem. Euler's method is the fundamental numerical technique for approximating the solution, thereby establishing a baseline for accuracy. The precision of our computations is subsequently improved by employing Richardson's extrapolation to reduce errors systematically. This approach not only illustrates the adaptability of numerical methods in solving intricate mathematical problems, but it also emphasizes the significance of strategic error reduction techniques in enhancing computational outcomes. We present the efficacy of this method in solving triple integrals in an efficient manner through experimentation and analysis, thereby making a significant contribution to the fields of numerical computation and mathematical modeling.

TL;DR: 提出了IANO框架，通过显式利用界面信息作为物理先验来提升多相流预测精度，在数据稀缺和噪声条件下保持鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多相流系统具有复杂动力学、场不连续性和相间相互作用，传统数值求解器计算挑战大，而神经算子方法在实现高分辨率数值精度方面存在困难，主要源于空间异质性和高质量训练数据稀缺。

Result: 实验结果表明，IANO在多相流模拟中比基线方法准确率提升约10%，在数据稀缺和噪声扰动条件下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: IANO通过显式利用界面信息作为物理先验，有效提升了多相流模拟的预测精度，特别是在低数据条件下表现出色。

Abstract: Multiphase flow systems, with their complex dynamics, field discontinuities, and interphase interactions, pose significant computational challenges for traditional numerical solvers. While neural operators offer efficient alternatives, they often struggle to achieve high-resolution numerical accuracy in these systems. This limitation primarily stems from the inherent spatial heterogeneity and the scarcity of high-quality training data in multiphase flows. In this work, we propose the Interface Information-Aware Neural Operator (IANO), a novel framework that explicitly leverages interface information as a physical prior to enhance the prediction accuracy. The IANO architecture introduces two key components: 1) An interface-aware multiple function encoding mechanism jointly models multiple physical fields and interfaces, thus capturing the high-frequency physical features at the interface. 2) A geometry-aware positional encoding mechanism further establishes the relationship between interface information, physical variables, and spatial positions, enabling it to achieve pointwise super-resolution prediction even in the low-data regimes. Experimental results demonstrate that IANO outperforms baselines by $\sim$10\% in accuracy for multiphase flow simulations while maintaining robustness under data-scarce and noise-perturbed conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的一致δ+-更新拉格朗日粒子流体动力学(ULPH)模型，通过扩展支持域、优化速度散度矩阵、一致粒子偏移和声学阻尼项等技术，在较少邻域粒子情况下实现更高精度、更低数值耗散和更好能量守恒。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，与常规ULPH和一致δ+-SPH相比，该模型能够准确模拟温和波浪和剧烈晃荡流动，在长期和长距离波传播模拟中表现出更高精度和更低数值耗散，计算效率显著提升。

Conclusion: 一致δ+-ULPH模型在较少邻域粒子情况下仍能保持高精度和低数值耗散，是流体模拟的有效改进方法。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel consistent δ+- Updated Lagrangian Particle Hydrodynamics (ULPH) model. Although the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) model has gained recognized achievements, it is afflicted by excessive numerical dissipation when the neighboring particles are insufficient. The present proposed consistent δ+-ULPH model has advantages in overcoming this problem. To improve the accuracy, efficiency, stability, and energy conservation, several new techniques are introduced to the consistent δ+-ULPH model. A novel extended support domain technique is proposed to achieve higher accuracy with fewer neighboring particles. An optimal matrix for the velocity divergence is proposed to improve the free-surface stability. A consistent particle shifting technique for the ULPH scheme is proposed to maintain a uniform and regular particle distribution and obtain superior conservation. In addition, an acoustic damper term for the ULPH scheme is introduced to improve the pressure field stability. Five benchmark tests were carried out to validate the consistent δ+-ULPH model. The conventional ULPH and the consistent δ+-SPH results are presented for comparison. Results indicate that the proposed consistent δ+-ULPH model can accurately simulate both gentle waves and violent sloshing flows and shows higher accuracy and lower numerical dissipation when using fewer neighboring particles, even in long-term and long-distance wave propagation simulations. Additionally, the computational efficiency of the consistent δ+-ULPH model is enhanced visibly because of fewer neighboring particles.

Abstract: A unified Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation framework for coronary stent implantation is developed, which unifies weakly compressible hemodynamics, Neo-Hookean solids, and stent-artery contacts, based on a multi-resolution particle discretization. Prior to application, feasibility and accuracy are established via three baseline validations: (i) poiseuille flow in a two-dimensional channel with prescribed parabolic inflow and a pressure outlet, maintaining parabolic profiles with low Root Mean Squared Error of Prediction (RMSEP); (ii) channel flow initialized with a uniform velocity field and driven by a specified inlet-outlet pressure differential, with agreement to reference profiles quantified by low RMSEP at five reference instants; and (iii) a three-ring impact benchmark in solid mechanics, capturing large deformation, multi-body contact, and self-contact. The validated framework is subsequently applied to a coronary bifurcation with a focal stenosis, where flow-field diagnostics reveal acceleration at the stenotic throat, near-wall low-velocity zones, and co-localization of elevated pressure with increased Von Mises stress at the bifurcation and inlet. Following simulated stent implantation, velocity transitions across the stenosis become smoother, pressure gradients are reduced, and the fractional flow reserve increases from 0.45 to 0.91. These results demonstrate that the proposed SPH framework yields quantitatively reliable, clinically interpretable hemodynamic metrics alongside robust solid-solid contact predictions, thereby supporting rigorous analysis and pre-procedural planning of vascular interventions.

Abstract: A physics-based methodology for the determination of the localization function for the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) is proposed. The spatial features of such function evolve dynamically over time according to the relevant instantaneous flow features of the ensemble members with the objective, to reduce the computational cost of the Data Assimilation (DA) procedure when applied with solvers for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The validation of the methodology has been carried out by the analysis of two test cases exhibiting different features. This permits to investigate different physical features, tailored for each test case, which affect the localization function. The flow over a two-dimensional square cylinder at $Re=150$ is the first case investigated. It has been shown that the proposed localization procedure leads to a more cost-effective DA process by reducing the size of the assimilated regions while keeping the same level of accuracy. The capabilities of the methodology are further demonstrated by the investigation of the turbulent flow around a three-dimensional circular cylinder for $Re=3900$. Again, the methodology exhibits an excellent trade off in terms of accuracy versus computational requirements.

Abstract: Three-dimensional unsteady numerical simulations are performed to investigate the effects of blowing ratio $C_B$ ($0.85 < \overline{U}_j/U_\infty < 1.7$), stroke ratio $L^+$ ($10.6 < \overline{U}_j /(fd) < 21.3$), and boundary-layer height ratio $D^+$ ($2.1<δ/d<8.0$) on circular synthetic jet actuator (SJA) performance in crossflow. Nine cases are examined at constant free-stream velocity $U_\infty$, with systematic independent variation of averaged jet velocity $\overline{U}_j$, actuation frequency $f$ ($200$-$400~\mathrm{Hz}$), and boundary-layer momentum thickness Reynolds number ($170<Re_θ<740$) to isolate the individual effects of these parameters on a circular-nozzle SJA with fixed nozzle diameter $d$ in crossflow. Instantaneous vortical structures exhibited tilted vortex rings with a trailing vortex pair at low actuation frequency; closely packed expelled vortical structures for higher frequency SJAs, and the largest boundary-layer height ratio induced hairpin-like vortices. Near-wall tertiary vortices, which promote downwash and increase wall shear stress, remain coherent longer and have extended spanwise coverage for low $D^+$. Time-averaged boundary-layer profiles and skin-friction distributions reveal that SJAs with low to moderate $D^+$ have the greatest potential for separation control, maintaining increased near-wall momentum over extended streamwise distances.

Abstract: In hypersonic boundary-layer flows over blunt bodies, laminar-turbulent transition exhibits two distinct regimes: for small nose radii, increased bluntness delays transition; beyond a critical radius, further increasing bluntness reverses this trend. The latter regime corresponds to a bypass transition route, whose onset remains challenging to predict. The primary difficulty lies in capturing the excitation of non-modal streaks in the nose region, which is strongly affected by the bow shock and entropy layer effects. Recently, Zhao & Dong (J. Fluid Mech., 2025, 1013: A44) develops a high-efficient, high-accuracy shock-fitting harmonic linearised Navier-Stokes (SF-HLNS) approach to quantify the excitation of linear non-modal perturbations. In this paper, we present a predictive framework for bypass transition by integrating the SF-HLNS approach with the nonlinear parabolised stability equations (NPSE) and the bi-global stability analysis (BSA). The NPSE is employed to track the nonlinear evolution of the streaky perturbations up to nonlinear saturation, while the BSA approach is used to capture the high-growth secondary instabilities. By integrating the growth rates of these secondary instability from their neutral positions, an amplitude amplification factor is obtained, enabling the prediction of transition onset. Under slow-acoustic forcing conditions drawn from wind-tunnel experiments, the present hybrid framework successfully reproduces the transition-reversal phenomenon at large nose radii, and yields quantitative agreement with measured transition locations, thereby validating its predictive capability.

Abstract: Understanding how submerged vegetation modifies the water surface is crucial for modeling momentum exchange between shallow waters and the atmosphere. In particular, quantifying its impact on the equivalent aerodynamic roughness of the water surface is essential for improved boundary-layer parameterization in oceanic and atmospheric models. In this Letter, we present fully resolved multiphase simulations of gravity-driven flow over a fully submerged vegetated bed, capturing the coupled dynamics of air, water, and individual plant stems, under quasi-realistic conditions (the air/water viscosity ratio is real, while the density ratio is reduced tenfold). Our results show that vegetation submerged for four times its height regularizes the water surface suppressing strong deformations and homogenizing streamwise-propagating wave fronts along the transversal direction. Despite these alterations, the equivalent roughness perceived by the overlying air flow remains unchanged. These findings clarify vegetation-surface interactions and provide quantitative insights for nature-based wave mitigation strategies and atmospheric boundary-layer modeling.

Abstract: Bacteria living on surfaces are often confined to droplets. When these droplets evaporate, the motion of the liquid-air interface and the associated internal capillary flow confine the bacteria. Here we study how \emph{E. coli} bacteria interact with this capillary confinement and agglomerate at the droplet's contact line. We identify three different types of bacterial pattern formation that depend on the bacterial activity and the environmental conditions imposed by the evaporating droplet. When the evaporation is fast, the bacteria are slow or the suspension is dilute, a uniform contact-line deposit forms. However, when the capillary confinement concentrates the bacteria at the contact line beyond a critical number density, localized collective motion spontaneously emerges. In that case, the bacteria induce a local stirring of the liquid that allows them to self-organize into periodic patterns and enables them to collectively escape from the contact line. At very high number densities, these periodic patterns get destabilized by bacterial turbulence in the bulk of the droplet resulting in the formation of mobile bacterial plumes at the contact line. Our results show how the subtle interplay between the bacteria and the capillary flow inside the droplet that surrounds them governs their dispersal.

Abstract: This paper proposes a diffuse-interface model for simulating gas-liquid-solid multiphase flows involving solid-liquid phase change, solute transport, and the Marangoni effect. In this model, a phase-field method is employed to capture the evolution of fluid-fluid interfaces, while an enthalpy-based approach is used to describe the temperature field and implicitly track the solid-liquid interface. Solute transport is modeled using a constrained scalar-transport model combined with a pseudo-potential concentration approach. The proposed diffuse-interface model satisfies the reduction consistency, and can degenerate to the conservative phase-field method for incompressible two-phase flow and the classical enthalpy method for binary material solidification in an appropriate way. Furthermore, the model not only can preserve the mass conservation, but also can capture the volume change induced by phase change. To solve the diffuse-interface model, a lattice Boltzmann (LB) method is then developed, and the numerical tests demonstrate that the method has a good performance in the study of the freezing process coupled with Marangoni flow, phase-change-induced volume change, and solute transport. Finally, the model is applied to investigate the freezing dynamics of a system containing an insoluble impurity, revealing the complex interaction between the advancing freezing front and the impurity. It is found that the numerical results are in good agreement with experimental data.

To study this process more effectively, we optimised a 3-channel microfluidic device designed to create a stable gradient of chemoattractants. This setup allows us to simultaneously monitor the response of Escherichia coli to casamino acids or alpha-methyl-DL-aspartic acid at the individual level.

*Justin Kin Jun Hew,David N. Hosking,Christoph Federrath,James R. Beattie,Neco Kriel*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: 本文研究了无净磁螺旋度的各向同性衰减MHD湍流中磁螺旋度涨落守恒问题，分析了边界项对IH守恒的影响，发现对于空间局域的规范选择，破坏IH守恒的长程关联无法动态发展，但在某些非局域规范下可能发生。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hosking & Schekochihin (2021) 提出无净磁螺旋度的各向同性衰减MHD湍流中，大体积内磁螺旋度涨落的均方值（IH）是守恒的。但IH的守恒性和规范不变性要求某些边界项为零，这些边界项反映了湍流在任意大距离上组织通量以耗尽或增强磁螺旋度涨落的能力。

Method: 采用类似于Batchelor & Proudman (1956)的方法来确定相关关联函数的渐近形式，分析不同规范选择下长程关联的发展可能性，并通过高分辨率数值模拟验证理论预测。

Result: 研究发现，如果磁矢势的演化方程在空间上是局域的，那么足以破坏IH守恒的长程关联无法动态发展。对于包括库仑规范在内的一类非局域规范选择，这种关联也无法发展。但识别出一类非局域规范选择，其中可能产生足以破坏IH守恒的强关联。

Conclusion: IH的守恒性取决于规范选择：对于空间局域和包括库仑规范在内的某些非局域规范，IH是守恒的；但对于某些特定的非局域规范，IH守恒可能被破坏。

Abstract: Hosking & Schekochihin (2021, Phys. Rev. X 11, 041005) have proposed that statistically isotropic decaying MHD turbulence without net magnetic helicity conserves the mean square fluctuation level of magnetic helicity in large volumes -- or, equivalently, the integral over space of the two-point correlation function of the magnetic-helicity density, denoted $I_H$. Formally, the conservation and gauge invariance of $I_H$ require the vanishing of certain boundary terms related to the strength of long-range spatial correlations. These boundary terms represent the ability (or otherwise) of the turbulence to organise fluxes over arbitrarily large distances to deplete or enhance fluctuations of magnetic helicity. In this work, we present a theory of these boundary terms, employing a methodology analogous to that of Batchelor & Proudman (1956, Philos. Trans. R. Soc. A 248, 369) to determine the relevant asymptotic forms of correlation functions. We find that long-range correlations of sufficient strength to violate the conservation of $I_H$ cannot develop dynamically if the evolution equation for the magnetic vector potential is chosen to be local in space. Likewise, we find that such correlations cannot develop for a wide class of gauge choices that make this equation non-local (including the Coulomb gauge). Nonetheless, we also identify a class of non-local gauge choices for which correlations that are sufficiently strong to violate the conservation of $I_H$ do appear possible. We verify our theoretical predictions for the case of the Coulomb gauge with measurements of correlation functions in a high-resolution numerical simulation.

*Kaleem Ullah Qasim,Jiashu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CGAR是一种新的训练方法，通过将课程学习应用于架构深度而非传统数据排序，显著提高了递归推理模型的训练效率。该方法包含渐进深度课程和分层监督加权两个组件，在Sudoku-Extreme数据集上实现了1.71倍训练加速和42%成本降低，同时仅损失0.63%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 递归推理模型虽然性能优异，但训练成本高昂（约36 GPU小时/数据集），限制了其广泛应用和研究。需要开发更高效的训练方法。

Method: CGAR包含两个关键组件：1) 渐进深度课程：在训练过程中动态调整递归深度，从浅到深配置；2) 分层监督加权：对监督步骤应用指数衰减的重要性权重，使损失加权与观测到的梯度幅度衰减对齐。

Result: 在Sudoku-Extreme数据集上，CGAR实现了1.71倍训练加速（10.93到6.38小时，42%成本降低），仅损失0.63%准确率（86.65%到86.02%）。渐进深度课程单独使用可实现2.26倍加速和85.47%准确率。

Conclusion: CGAR证明了在架构深度上应用原则性课程学习能够有效训练递归推理模型，在适度硬件上实现高效训练，同时提高推理效率（100%停止准确率和11%更少推理步骤）。

Abstract: Recursive reasoning models achieve remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks through iterative refinement, enabling tiny networks to match large language models thousands of times their size. However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps. Our work demonstrates that principled curriculum on architectural depth enables efficient training of recursive reasoning models on modest hardware.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出PhyKAN，一种基于可学习基函数的电磁建模方法，替代传统的静态RWG基函数，通过Kolmogorov-Arnold网络实现自适应基函数学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统矩量法受限于静态几何定义的基函数（如RWG基），无法自适应学习最优基函数表示。

Method: 提出PhyKAN模型，将RWG基推广为可学习自适应基函数族，结合局部KAN分支和嵌入格林函数先验的全局分支，保持物理一致性。

Result: 在典型几何结构上，PhyKAN实现低于0.01的重建误差，并能准确无监督预测雷达散射截面。

Conclusion: PhyKAN为经典求解器与现代神经网络模型之间提供了可解释、物理一致的桥梁，推进了电磁建模方法的发展。

Abstract: The Method of Moments (MoM) is constrained by the usage of static, geometry-defined basis functions, such as the Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis. This letter reframes electromagnetic modeling around a learnable basis representation rather than solving for the coefficients over a fixed basis. We first show that the RWG basis is essentially a static and piecewise-linear realization of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Inspired by this insight, we propose PhyKAN, a physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that generalizes RWG into a learnable and adaptive basis family. Derived from the EFIE, PhyKAN integrates a local KAN branch with a global branch embedded with Green's function priors to preserve physical consistency. It is demonstrated that, across canonical geometries, PhyKAN achieves sub-0.01 reconstruction errors as well as accurate, unsupervised radar cross section predictions, offering an interpretable, physics-consistent bridge between classical solvers and modern neural network models for electromagnetic modeling.

Conclusion: TabPFN-2.5显著提升了表格AI的性能和实用性，通过蒸馏技术实现了高效部署，将加强现有TabPFN生态系统的应用。

Abstract: The first tabular foundation model, TabPFN, and its successor TabPFNv2 have impacted tabular AI substantially, with dozens of methods building on it and hundreds of applications across different use cases. This report introduces TabPFN-2.5, the next generation of our tabular foundation model, built for datasets with up to 50,000 data points and 2,000 features, a 20x increase in data cells compared to TabPFNv2. TabPFN-2.5 is now the leading method for the industry standard benchmark TabArena (which contains datasets with up to 100,000 training data points), substantially outperforming tuned tree-based models and matching the accuracy of AutoGluon 1.4, a complex four-hour tuned ensemble that even includes the previous TabPFNv2. Remarkably, default TabPFN-2.5 has a 100% win rate against default XGBoost on small to medium-sized classification datasets (<=10,000 data points, 500 features) and a 87% win rate on larger datasets up to 100K samples and 2K features (85% for regression). For production use cases, we introduce a new distillation engine that converts TabPFN-2.5 into a compact MLP or tree ensemble, preserving most of its accuracy while delivering orders-of-magnitude lower latency and plug-and-play deployment. This new release will immediately strengthen the performance of the many applications and methods already built on the TabPFN ecosystem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值求解器计算成本高，而现有数据驱动方法存在误差累积和物理一致性不足的问题，特别是在多物理场和复杂几何中

Method: 将PDE动力学（如对流、粘性、扩散）嵌入到不同的消息函数中，采用分层架构捕捉多尺度特征，并在损失函数中加入物理正则化

Conclusion: PEGNet通过物理嵌入的消息传递机制，能够产生更稳定和物理一致的PDE解，为复杂物理现象的模拟提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulations of physical phenomena governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) are important for scientific and engineering progress. While traditional numerical solvers are powerful, they are often computationally expensive. Recently, data-driven methods have emerged as alternatives, but they frequently suffer from error accumulation and limited physical consistency, especially in multiphysics and complex geometries. To address these challenges, we propose PEGNet, a Physics-Embedded Graph Network that incorporates PDE-guided message passing to redesign the graph neural network architecture. By embedding key PDE dynamics like convection, viscosity, and diffusion into distinct message functions, the model naturally integrates physical constraints into its forward propagation, producing more stable and physically consistent solutions. Additionally, a hierarchical architecture is employed to capture multi-scale features, and physical regularization is integrated into the loss function to further enforce adherence to governing physics. We evaluated PEGNet on benchmarks, including custom datasets for respiratory airflow and drug delivery, showing significant improvements in long-term prediction accuracy and physical consistency over existing methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yanghuoshan/PEGNet.

*David Sanchez,Holly Lopez,Michelle Buraczyk,Anantaa Kotal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAIRPLAI是一个将人类监督集成到机器学习系统设计和部署中的框架，通过隐私-公平边界、交互式利益相关者输入和差分隐私审计循环，在保持强隐私保护的同时减少公平性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习系统在医疗、金融、招聘等关键领域的应用，仅关注准确性已不足够，模型还需保证公平性、隐私保护和问责制。但现有方法存在隐私保护可能加剧不公平、公平性干预依赖敏感数据、自动化流程忽视人类判断等问题。

Method: FAIRPLAI通过三个核心机制工作：(1)构建隐私-公平边界，透明展示准确性、隐私保证和群体结果之间的权衡；(2)支持交互式利益相关者输入，让决策者选择符合领域需求的公平标准和操作点；(3)嵌入差分私有审计循环，使人类能够审查解释和边缘案例而不损害数据安全。

Result: 在基准数据集上的应用表明，FAIRPLAI在保持强隐私保护的同时，相对于自动化基线方法持续减少了公平性差异。更重要的是，它为从业者提供了一个简单、可解释的过程来管理准确性、隐私和公平性之间的竞争需求。

Conclusion: 通过在关键位置嵌入人类判断，FAIRPLAI为在实践中构建有效、负责任和可信赖的机器学习系统提供了一条可行路径，使系统能够在具有社会影响力的应用中平衡准确性、隐私和公平性的竞争需求。

Abstract: As machine learning systems move from theory to practice, they are increasingly tasked with decisions that affect healthcare access, financial opportunities, hiring, and public services. In these contexts, accuracy is only one piece of the puzzle - models must also be fair to different groups, protect individual privacy, and remain accountable to stakeholders. Achieving all three is difficult: differential privacy can unintentionally worsen disparities, fairness interventions often rely on sensitive data that privacy restricts, and automated pipelines ignore that fairness is ultimately a human and contextual judgment. We introduce FAIRPLAI (Fair and Private Learning with Active Human Influence), a practical framework that integrates human oversight into the design and deployment of machine learning systems. FAIRPLAI works in three ways: (1) it constructs privacy-fairness frontiers that make trade-offs between accuracy, privacy guarantees, and group outcomes transparent; (2) it enables interactive stakeholder input, allowing decision-makers to select fairness criteria and operating points that reflect their domain needs; and (3) it embeds a differentially private auditing loop, giving humans the ability to review explanations and edge cases without compromising individual data security. Applied to benchmark datasets, FAIRPLAI consistently preserves strong privacy protections while reducing fairness disparities relative to automated baselines. More importantly, it provides a straightforward, interpretable process for practitioners to manage competing demands of accuracy, privacy, and fairness in socially impactful applications. By embedding human judgment where it matters most, FAIRPLAI offers a pathway to machine learning systems that are effective, responsible, and trustworthy in practice.

TL;DR: 提出了LLM-ABS框架来研究大型语言模型在独裁者游戏中的行为，发现系统提示对模型行为有显著影响，模型通常表现出强烈的公平偏好，但提示敏感性仍是挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽视了系统提示在塑造LLM行为中的作用，且未考虑结果对提示微小变化的敏感性，需要建立稳健的基线来研究LLM的复杂行为特征。

Method: 提出LLM-ABS框架：(i)探索不同系统提示对模型行为的影响；(ii)使用中性提示变体获得更可靠的代理偏好洞察；(iii)分析LLM代理对开放式指令响应的语言特征以理解其行为背后的推理。

Result: 代理通常表现出强烈的公平偏好，系统提示对其行为有显著影响。从语言角度看，模型以不同方式表达其响应。提示敏感性仍是持续挑战。

Conclusion: 尽管提示敏感性仍是挑战，但提出的LLM-ABS框架为LLM代理行为研究提供了稳健基础。

Abstract: In behavioral sciences, experiments such as the ultimatum game are conducted to assess preferences for fairness or self-interest of study participants. In the dictator game, a simplified version of the ultimatum game where only one of two players makes a single decision, the dictator unilaterally decides how to split a fixed sum of money between themselves and the other player. Although recent studies have explored behavioral patterns of AI agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) instructed to adopt different personas, we question the robustness of these results. In particular, many of these studies overlook the role of the system prompt - the underlying instructions that shape the model's behavior - and do not account for how sensitive results can be to slight changes in prompts. However, a robust baseline is essential when studying highly complex behavioral aspects of LLMs. To overcome previous limitations, we propose the LLM agent behavior study (LLM-ABS) framework to (i) explore how different system prompts influence model behavior, (ii) get more reliable insights into agent preferences by using neutral prompt variations, and (iii) analyze linguistic features in responses to open-ended instructions by LLM agents to better understand the reasoning behind their behavior. We found that agents often exhibit a strong preference for fairness, as well as a significant impact of the system prompt on their behavior. From a linguistic perspective, we identify that models express their responses differently. Although prompt sensitivity remains a persistent challenge, our proposed framework demonstrates a robust foundation for LLM agent behavior studies.

Conclusion: 该分析框架和见解使交通管理部门能够测量给定出行需求的城市交通碳排放，并优化特定位置的交通管理和规划决策以减少网络范围排放。

Abstract: Urban congestions cause inefficient movement of vehicles and exacerbate greenhouse gas emissions and urban air pollution. Macroscopic emission fundamental diagram (eMFD)captures an orderly relationship among emission and aggregated traffic variables at the network level, allowing for real-time monitoring of region-wide emissions and optimal allocation of travel demand to existing networks, reducing urban congestion and associated emissions. However, empirically derived eMFD models are sparse due to historical data limitation. Leveraging a large-scale and granular traffic and emission data derived from probe vehicles, this study is the first to apply machine learning methods to predict the network wide emission rate to traffic relationship in U.S. urban areas at a large scale. The analysis framework and insights developed in this work generate data-driven eMFDs and a deeper understanding of their location dependence on network, infrastructure, land use, and vehicle characteristics, enabling transportation authorities to measure carbon emissions from urban transport of given travel demand and optimize location specific traffic management and planning decisions to mitigate network-wide emissions.

Conclusion: 基于Gromov-Wasserstein几何的图粗化方法有效，GPC和KGPC算法在保持图结构质量的同时实现了高效的图简化。

Abstract: We study the problem of graph coarsening within the Gromov-Wasserstein geometry. Specifically, we propose two algorithms that leverage a novel representation of the distortion induced by merging pairs of nodes. The first method, termed Greedy Pair Coarsening (GPC), iteratively merges pairs of nodes that locally minimize a measure of distortion until the desired size is achieved. The second method, termed $k$-means Greedy Pair Coarsening (KGPC), leverages clustering based on pairwise distortion metrics to directly merge clusters of nodes. We provide conditions guaranteeing optimal coarsening for our methods and validate their performance on six large-scale datasets and a downstream clustering task. Results show that the proposed methods outperform existing approaches on a wide range of parameters and scenarios.

Abstract: Using Frequency-domain Holographic Reduced Representations (FHRRs), we extend a Vector-Symbolic Architecture (VSA) encoding of Lisp 1.5 with primitives for arithmetic operations using Residue Hyperdimensional Computing (RHC). Encoding a Turing-complete syntax over a high-dimensional vector space increases the expressivity of neural network states, enabling network states to contain arbitrarily structured representations that are inherently interpretable. We discuss the potential applications of the VSA encoding in machine learning tasks, as well as the importance of encoding structured representations and designing neural networks whose behavior is sensitive to the structure of their representations in virtue of attaining more general intelligent agents than exist at present.

TL;DR: BayesQ是一个基于后验期望损失优化的不确定性引导后训练量化框架，通过拟合权重的高斯后验、白化、设计码本和混合精度分配，在3.0/3.5/4.0比特下显著提升ResNet-50和BERT-base的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后训练量化方法未充分考虑权重不确定性，BayesQ首次将量化优化置于后验期望损失框架下，通过不确定性感知的风险最小化提升低比特量化性能。

Method: 拟合权重的轻量高斯后验（默认对角拉普拉斯），基于后验协方差白化，设计最小化后验期望失真的码本，使用贪心背包算法分配混合精度，支持标量量化器的闭式解和任务感知代理的蒙特卡洛方法。

Result: 在3.0/3.5/4.0平均比特/权重下，BayesQ相比GPTQ在ResNet-50上提升+1.5/+0.7/+0.3 top-1百分点，在BERT-base上提升+1.1/+0.4/+0.2 GLUE分数，预处理成本与GPTQ相当。

Conclusion: BayesQ将低比特量化重新定义为不确定性感知的风险最小化问题，提供了一个实用且高效的后训练量化解决方案。

Abstract: We present BayesQ, an uncertainty-guided post-training quantization framework that is the first to optimize quantization under the posterior expected loss. BayesQ fits a lightweight Gaussian posterior over weights (diagonal Laplace by default; optional K-FAC/low-rank), whitens by the posterior covariance, designs codebooks to minimize posterior-expected distortion, and allocates mixed precision via a greedy knapsack that maximizes marginal expected-loss reduction per bit under a global budget. For scalar quantizers, posterior-expected MSE yields closed-form tables; task-aware proxies are handled by short Monte Carlo on a small calibration set. An optional calibration-only distillation aligns the quantized model with the posterior predictive teacher. At matched average bits/weight of 3.0/3.5/4.0, BayesQ improves over strong PTQ baselines on ResNet-50 (ImageNet) and BERT-base (GLUE) e.g., vs. GPTQ by $+1.5/+0.7/+0.3$ top-1 percentage points on RN50 and $+1.1/+0.4/+0.2$ GLUE points on BERT, while requiring one-time preprocessing comparable to a GPTQ pass. BayesQ reframes low-bit quantization as uncertainty-aware risk minimization in a practical, post-training pipeline.

Conclusion: LyapInf方法提供了一种有效的稳定性分析框架，能够在缺乏系统显式模型的情况下，仅通过轨迹数据推断稳定性区域。

Abstract: In the design and operation of complex dynamical systems, it is essential to ensure that all state trajectories of the dynamical system converge to a desired equilibrium within a guaranteed stability region. Yet, for many practical systems -- especially in aerospace -- this region cannot be determined a priori and is often challenging to compute. One of the most common methods for computing the stability region is to identify a Lyapunov function. A Lyapunov function is a positive function whose time derivative along system trajectories is non-positive, which provides a sufficient condition for stability and characterizes an estimated stability region. However, existing methods of characterizing a stability region via a Lyapunov function often rely on explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In this work, we present a new physics-informed machine learning method of characterizing an estimated stability region by inferring a Lyapunov function from system trajectory data that treats the dynamical system as a black box and does not require explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In our presented Lyapunov function Inference method (LyapInf), we propose a quadratic form for the unknown Lyapunov function and fit the unknown quadratic operator to system trajectory data by minimizing the average residual of the Zubov equation, a first-order partial differential equation whose solution yields a Lyapunov function. The inferred quadratic Lyapunov function can then characterize an ellipsoidal estimate of the stability region. Numerical results on benchmark examples demonstrate that our physics-informed stability analysis method successfully characterizes a near-maximal ellipsoid of the system stability region associated with the inferred Lyapunov function without requiring knowledge of the system governing equations.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose capturing and utilizing \textit{Temporal Information through Graph-based Embeddings and Representations} or \textbf{TIGER} to enhance multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We explicitly model how inter-agent coordination structures evolve over time. While most MARL approaches rely on static or per-step relational graphs, they overlook the temporal evolution of interactions that naturally arise as agents adapt, move, or reorganize cooperation strategies. Capturing such evolving dependencies is key to achieving robust and adaptive coordination. To this end, TIGER constructs dynamic temporal graphs of MARL agents, connecting their current and historical interactions. It then employs a temporal attention-based encoder to aggregate information across these structural and temporal neighborhoods, yielding time-aware agent embeddings that guide cooperative policy learning. Through extensive experiments on two coordination-intensive benchmarks, we show that TIGER consistently outperforms diverse value-decomposition and graph-based MARL baselines in task performance and sample efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to isolate the impact of key design parameters in TIGER, revealing how structural and temporal factors can jointly shape effective policy learning in MARL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出DP-PMLF方法，通过结合逐样本动量和低通滤波策略，同时减轻差分隐私噪声和裁剪偏差，提升DPSGD的隐私-效用权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的差分隐私随机梯度下降方法通常只解决噪声或偏差中的一个问题，减少DP噪声会加剧裁剪偏差，反之亦然，需要一种能同时缓解两者的方法。

Method: DP-PMLF使用逐样本动量在裁剪前平滑梯度估计以减少采样方差，并采用后处理低通滤波器衰减高频DP噪声，无需消耗额外隐私预算。

Result: 理论分析显示在严格DP保证下具有改进的收敛速率，实证评估表明相比现有DPSGD变体显著提升了隐私-效用权衡。

Conclusion: DP-PMLF通过同时缓解DP噪声和裁剪偏差，为深度神经网络训练提供了更好的差分隐私保护与模型准确性平衡。

Abstract: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) is widely used to train deep neural networks with formal privacy guarantees. However, the addition of differential privacy (DP) often degrades model accuracy by introducing both noise and bias. Existing techniques typically address only one of these issues, as reducing DP noise can exacerbate clipping bias and vice-versa. In this paper, we propose a novel method, \emph{DP-PMLF}, which integrates per-sample momentum with a low-pass filtering strategy to simultaneously mitigate DP noise and clipping bias. Our approach uses per-sample momentum to smooth gradient estimates prior to clipping, thereby reducing sampling variance. It further employs a post-processing low-pass filter to attenuate high-frequency DP noise without consuming additional privacy budget. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating an improved convergence rate under rigorous DP guarantees, and our empirical evaluations reveal that DP-PMLF significantly enhances the privacy-utility trade-off compared to several state-of-the-art DPSGD variants.

Abstract: Topological descriptors have been increasingly utilized for capturing multiscale structural information in relational data. In this work, we consider various filtrations on the (box) product of graphs and the effect on their outputs on the topological descriptors - the Euler characteristic (EC) and persistent homology (PH). In particular, we establish a complete characterization of the expressive power of EC on general color-based filtrations. We also show that the PH descriptors of (virtual) graph products contain strictly more information than the computation on individual graphs, whereas EC does not. Additionally, we provide algorithms to compute the PH diagrams of the product of vertex- and edge-level filtrations on the graph product. We also substantiate our theoretical analysis with empirical investigations on runtime analysis, expressivity, and graph classification performance. Overall, this work paves way for powerful graph persistent descriptors via product filtrations. Code is available at https://github.com/Aalto-QuML/tda_graph_product.

TL;DR: 提出了两种GNN无关的图超分辨率框架：Bi-SR通过二分图连接低分辨率和高分辨率节点实现结构感知的节点超分辨率，DEFEND通过将高分辨率边映射到对偶图节点来学习边表示。在真实脑连接组数据集上取得SOTA性能，并引入12个模拟数据集用于全面基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图超分辨率方法存在两个关键限制：基于矩阵的节点超分辨率忽略了图结构且缺乏置换不变性；依赖节点表示推断边权重限制了可扩展性和表达能力。

Method: Bi-SR框架构建连接LR和HR节点的二分图，实现保持拓扑和置换不变性的结构感知节点超分辨率；DEFEND框架通过将HR边映射到对偶图节点来学习边表示，允许通过标准节点GNN进行边推断。

Result: 在真实脑连接组数据集上，两个框架在七个拓扑度量上均达到最先进性能。新引入的12个模拟数据集支持方法的泛化能力评估。

Conclusion: 提出的Bi-SR和DEFEND框架有效解决了现有图超分辨率方法的局限性，在保持图结构特性和提高表达能力方面表现出色，为资源受限领域如图医学提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph super-resolution, the task of inferring high-resolution (HR) graphs from low-resolution (LR) counterparts, is an underexplored yet crucial research direction that circumvents the need for costly data acquisition. This makes it especially desirable for resource-constrained fields such as the medical domain. While recent GNN-based approaches show promise, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) matrix-based node super-resolution that disregards graph structure and lacks permutation invariance; and (2) reliance on node representations to infer edge weights, which limits scalability and expressivity. In this work, we propose two GNN-agnostic frameworks to address these issues. First, Bi-SR introduces a bipartite graph connecting LR and HR nodes to enable structure-aware node super-resolution that preserves topology and permutation invariance. Second, DEFEND learns edge representations by mapping HR edges to nodes of a dual graph, allowing edge inference via standard node-based GNNs. We evaluate both frameworks on a real-world brain connectome dataset, where they achieve state-of-the-art performance across seven topological measures. To support generalization, we introduce twelve new simulated datasets that capture diverse topologies and LR-HR relationships. These enable comprehensive benchmarking of graph super-resolution methods.

Conclusion: 这是将SPD扩展到现代模型的第一步，表明该方法可用于发现可解释的参数空间机制

Abstract: Recent work in mechanistic interpretability has shown that decomposing models in parameter space may yield clean handles for analysis and intervention. Previous methods have demonstrated successful applications on a wide range of toy models, but the gap to "real models" has not yet been bridged. In this work, we extend Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD) to Transformer models, proposing an updated causal importance function suited for sequential data and a new loss function. We demonstrate that SPD can successfully decompose a toy induction-head model and recover the expected 2-step circuit. We also show that applying SPD to GPT-2-small can successfully locate subcomponents corresponding to interpretable concepts like "golf" and "basketball". These results take the first step in the direction of extending SPD to modern models, and show that we can use the method to surface interpretable parameter-space mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SWE预测方法未能充分利用时空相关性，也不提供不确定性估计，而这对水资源管理决策者具有重要价值。

Method: 结合注意力机制整合时空特征和交互，以及高斯过程模块提供预测不确定性的原则性量化。

Result: 在美国西部512个SNOTEL站点数据上的评估显示，相比现有方法在预测精度和预测区间方面均有显著改进。

Conclusion: 该模型为水资源管理社区提供了部署和反馈平台，突出了不同方法在不确定性估计方面的有效性。

Abstract: Various complex water management decisions are made in snow-dominant watersheds with the knowledge of Snow-Water Equivalent (SWE) -- a key measure widely used to estimate the water content of a snowpack. However, forecasting SWE is challenging because SWE is influenced by various factors including topography and an array of environmental conditions, and has therefore been observed to be spatio-temporally variable. Classical approaches to SWE forecasting have not adequately utilized these spatial/temporal correlations, nor do they provide uncertainty estimates -- which can be of significant value to the decision maker. In this paper, we present ForeSWE, a new probabilistic spatio-temporal forecasting model that integrates deep learning and classical probabilistic techniques. The resulting model features a combination of an attention mechanism to integrate spatiotemporal features and interactions, alongside a Gaussian process module that provides principled quantification of prediction uncertainty. We evaluate the model on data from 512 Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations in the Western US. The results show significant improvements in both forecasting accuracy and prediction interval compared to existing approaches. The results also serve to highlight the efficacy in uncertainty estimates between different approaches. Collectively, these findings have provided a platform for deployment and feedback by the water management community.

TL;DR: EEG-X是一个设备无关且抗噪声的脑电图基础模型，通过位置通道嵌入和噪声感知掩码重建策略，解决了EEG分析中的设备差异和低信噪比问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决EEG分析中的两个关键挑战：(1)不同设备导致的跨数据集变异性，(2)EEG的低信噪比问题，其中脑信号常被伪迹和非脑源淹没。

Method: 提出位置通道嵌入编码空间信息；采用噪声感知掩码重建策略，在原始和潜在空间中重建去噪信号；引入字典启发的卷积变换(DiCT)层，将信号投影到结构化特征空间。

Result: 在来自不同设备的数据集上，EEG-X在多个下游EEG任务中优于最先进方法，在电极布局不同的跨域设置中表现优异。

Conclusion: EEG-X为EEG分析提供了一个有效的设备无关和噪声鲁棒的基础模型，显著提升了跨域泛化能力和噪声鲁棒性。

Abstract: Foundation models for EEG analysis are still in their infancy, limited by two key challenges: (1) variability across datasets caused by differences in recording devices and configurations, and (2) the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEG, where brain signals are often buried under artifacts and non-brain sources. To address these challenges, we present EEG-X, a device-agnostic and noise-robust foundation model for EEG representation learning. EEG-X introduces a novel location-based channel embedding that encodes spatial information and improves generalization across domains and tasks by allowing the model to handle varying channel numbers, combinations, and recording lengths. To enhance robustness against noise, EEG-X employs a noise-aware masking and reconstruction strategy in both raw and latent spaces. Unlike previous models that mask and reconstruct raw noisy EEG signals, EEG-X is trained to reconstruct denoised signals obtained through an artifact removal process, ensuring that the learned representations focus on neural activity rather than noise. To further enhance reconstruction-based pretraining, EEG-X introduces a dictionary-inspired convolutional transformation (DiCT) layer that projects signals into a structured feature space before computing reconstruction (MSE) loss, reducing noise sensitivity and capturing frequency- and shape-aware similarities. Experiments on datasets collected from diverse devices show that EEG-X outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple downstream EEG tasks and excels in cross-domain settings where pre-trained and downstream datasets differ in electrode layouts.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Transformer编码器和CNN聚合器的两阶段架构，通过融合临床元数据和专家事件标注等上下文信息，显著提升了睡眠分期准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动睡眠分期劳动密集且存在评分者间差异，现有深度学习模型大多仅依赖原始PSG信号，忽略了人类专家使用的上下文线索。

Method: 使用Transformer-based的每时段编码器和1D CNN聚合器，系统地研究融合受试者临床元数据（年龄、性别、BMI）和每时段专家事件标注（呼吸暂停、血氧饱和度下降、觉醒、周期性呼吸）的效果。

Result: 在SHHS队列（n=8,357）上，上下文融合显著提高了分期准确性：与仅使用PSG的基线相比（macro-F1 0.7745, micro-F1 0.8774），最终模型达到macro-F1 0.8031和micro-F1 0.9051，其中事件标注贡献最大增益。

Conclusion: 将临床有意义特征与学习表示相结合，可在不修改PSG导联或需要额外传感器的情况下，提高性能和可解释性，为构建上下文感知、专家对齐的睡眠分期系统提供了实用且可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Manual sleep staging from polysomnography (PSG) is labor-intensive and prone to inter-scorer variability. While recent deep learning models have advanced automated staging, most rely solely on raw PSG signals and neglect contextual cues used by human experts. We propose a two-stage architecture that combines a Transformer-based per-epoch encoder with a 1D CNN aggregator, and systematically investigates the effect of incorporating explicit context: subject-level clinical metadata (age, sex, BMI) and per-epoch expert event annotations (apneas, desaturations, arousals, periodic breathing). Using the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) cohort (n=8,357), we demonstrate that contextual fusion substantially improves staging accuracy. Compared to a PSG-only baseline (macro-F1 0.7745, micro-F1 0.8774), our final model achieves macro-F1 0.8031 and micro-F1 0.9051, with event annotations contributing the largest gains. Notably, feature fusion outperforms multi-task alternatives that predict the same auxiliary labels. These results highlight that augmenting learned representations with clinically meaningful features enhances both performance and interpretability, without modifying the PSG montage or requiring additional sensors. Our findings support a practical and scalable path toward context-aware, expert-aligned sleep staging systems.

TL;DR: 提出了协方差散射变换(CSTs)，这是一种无需训练的深度网络，通过协方差谱中的局部化滤波器处理输入数据，生成层次化表示。相比PCA，CSTs在低样本情况下对协方差估计误差更稳定，且在神经退行性疾病数据集上的年龄预测任务中表现优于复杂学习模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PCA方法存在两个不足：无法捕捉低方差方向的信息（当数据包含高方差噪声时很重要），以及在低样本情况下结果不稳定（特别是当协方差特征值接近时）。虽然协方差神经网络(VNNs)改进了稳定性，但需要训练且依赖标签数据。

Method: 设计协方差散射变换(CSTs)，使用协方差小波作为滤波器来捕捉协方差谱中的特定模式，通过非线性变换生成层次化表示。采用剪枝机制提高计算和内存效率，并证明了CSTs对有限样本协方差估计误差的敏感性低于PCA。

Result: 在4个神经退行性疾病患者的皮层厚度测量数据集上的年龄预测实验中，CSTs在低数据设置下产生稳定表示（与VNNs相当但无需训练），预测性能与更复杂的学习模型相当或更好。

Conclusion: CSTs结合了PCA的无监督优势和VNNs的稳定性优势，无需训练即可生成表达性强的层次化表示，在低样本情况下表现稳定且预测性能优异。

Abstract: Machine learning and data processing techniques relying on covariance information are widespread as they identify meaningful patterns in unsupervised and unlabeled settings. As a prominent example, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) projects data points onto the eigenvectors of their covariance matrix, capturing the directions of maximum variance. This mapping, however, falls short in two directions: it fails to capture information in low-variance directions, relevant when, e.g., the data contains high-variance noise; and it provides unstable results in low-sample regimes, especially when covariance eigenvalues are close. CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs), i.e., graph neural networks using the covariance matrix as a graph, show improved stability to estimation errors and learn more expressive functions in the covariance spectrum than PCA, but require training and operate in a labeled setup. To get the benefits of both worlds, we propose Covariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs), deep untrained networks that sequentially apply filters localized in the covariance spectrum to the input data and produce expressive hierarchical representations via nonlinearities. We define the filters as covariance wavelets that capture specific and detailed covariance spectral patterns. We improve CSTs' computational and memory efficiency via a pruning mechanism, and we prove that their error due to finite-sample covariance estimations is less sensitive to close covariance eigenvalues compared to PCA, improving their stability. Our experiments on age prediction from cortical thickness measurements on 4 datasets collecting patients with neurodegenerative diseases show that CSTs produce stable representations in low-data settings, as VNNs but without any training, and lead to comparable or better predictions w.r.t. more complex learning models.

Motivation: 实践者在部署时间序列预测模型时面临困境：详尽验证数十个模型计算成本过高，但选择错误模型会导致性能不佳。需要一种快速筛选方法。

Method: 使用光谱可预测性Ω作为信号处理指标，在四个不同领域进行受控实验，并在GIFT-Eval基准的51个模型和28个数据集上扩展分析。

Result: 发现当Ω高时，大型时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）系统性地优于轻量级任务训练基线；当Ω低时，其优势消失。计算Ω仅需每数据集几秒钟。

Conclusion: Ω能够可预测地分层模型性能，提供了一个实用的初步筛选工具，既降低了验证成本，又凸显了需要开发在真正困难（低Ω）问题上表现出色的模型。

Abstract: Practitioners deploying time series forecasting models face a dilemma: exhaustively validating dozens of models is computationally prohibitive, yet choosing the wrong model risks poor performance. We show that spectral predictability~$Ω$ -- a simple signal processing metric -- systematically stratifies model family performance, enabling fast model selection. We conduct controlled experiments in four different domains, then further expand our analysis to 51 models and 28 datasets from the GIFT-Eval benchmark. We find that large time series foundation models (TSFMs) systematically outperform lightweight task-trained baselines when $Ω$ is high, while their advantage vanishes as $Ω$ drops. Computing $Ω$ takes seconds per dataset, enabling practitioners to quickly assess whether their data suits TSFM approaches or whether simpler, cheaper models suffice. We demonstrate that $Ω$ stratifies model performance predictably, offering a practical first-pass filter that reduces validation costs while highlighting the need for models that excel on genuinely difficult (low-$Ω$) problems rather than merely optimizing easy ones.

Abstract: Stroke is an acute cerebrovascular disease, and timely diagnosis significantly improves patient survival. However, existing automated diagnosis methods suffer from fairness issues across demographic groups, potentially exacerbating healthcare disparities. In this work we propose FAST-CAD, a theoretically grounded framework that combines domain-adversarial training (DAT) with group distributionally robust optimization (Group-DRO) for fair and accurate non-contact stroke diagnosis. Our approach is built on domain adaptation and minimax fairness theory and provides convergence guarantees and fairness bounds. We curate a multimodal dataset covering 12 demographic subgroups defined by age, gender, and posture. FAST-CAD employs self-supervised encoders with adversarial domain discrimination to learn demographic-invariant representations, while Group-DRO optimizes worst-group risk to ensure robust performance across all subgroups. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior diagnostic performance while maintaining fairness across demographic groups, and our theoretical analysis supports the effectiveness of the unified DAT + Group-DRO framework. This work provides both practical advances and theoretical insights for fair medical AI systems.

Conclusion: Weaver通过创新的注意力分解和负边建模方法，在保持竞争力的同时显著提高了交通时空预测的计算效率。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting on transportation networks is a complex task that requires understanding how traffic nodes interact within a dynamic, evolving system dictated by traffic flow dynamics and social behavioral patterns. The importance of transportation networks and ITS for modern mobility and commerce necessitates forecasting models that are not only accurate but also interpretable, efficient, and robust under structural or temporal perturbations. Recent approaches, particularly Transformer-based architectures, have improved predictive performance but often at the cost of high computational overhead and diminished architectural interpretability. In this work, we introduce Weaver, a novel attention-based model that applies Kronecker product approximations (KPA) to decompose the PN X PN spatiotemporal attention of O(P^2N^2) complexity into local P X P temporal and N X N spatial attention maps. This Kronecker attention map enables our Parallel-Kronecker Matrix-Vector product (P2-KMV) for efficient spatiotemporal message passing with O(P^2N + N^2P) complexity. To capture real-world traffic dynamics, we address the importance of negative edges in modeling traffic behavior by introducing Valence Attention using the continuous Tanimoto coefficient (CTC), which provides properties conducive to precise latent graph generation and training stability. To fully utilize the model's learning capacity, we introduce the Traffic Phase Dictionary for self-conditioning. Evaluations on PEMS-BAY and METR-LA show that Weaver achieves competitive performance across model categories while training more efficiently.

DeepDR leverages invaluable experience to recommend candidate drugs, which covers more than 15 networks and a comprehensive knowledge graph that includes 5.9 million edges across 107 types of relationships connecting drugs, diseases, proteins/genes, pathways, and expression from six existing databases and a large scientific corpus of 24 million PubMed publications. Additionally, the recommended results include detailed descriptions of the recommended drugs and visualize key patterns with interpretability through a knowledge graph. Conclusion: DeepDR is free and open to all users without the requirement of registration. We believe it can provide an easy-to-use, systematic, highly accurate, and computationally automated platform for both experimental and computational scientists.

Conclusion: DIVO通过价值条件优化成功平衡了离线强化学习中的保守性和探索性，为处理分布外动作和低质量数据集提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning, value overestimation caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions significantly limits policy performance. Recently, diffusion models have been leveraged for their strong distribution-matching capabilities, enforcing conservatism through behavior policy constraints. However, existing methods often apply indiscriminate regularization to redundant actions in low-quality datasets, resulting in excessive conservatism and an imbalance between the expressiveness and efficiency of diffusion modeling. To address these issues, we propose DIffusion policies with Value-conditional Optimization (DIVO), a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality, broadly covered in-distribution state-action samples while facilitating efficient policy improvement. Specifically, DIVO introduces a binary-weighted mechanism that utilizes the advantage values of actions in the offline dataset to guide diffusion model training. This enables a more precise alignment with the dataset's distribution while selectively expanding the boundaries of high-advantage actions. During policy improvement, DIVO dynamically filters high-return-potential actions from the diffusion model, effectively guiding the learned policy toward better performance. This approach achieves a critical balance between conservatism and explorability in offline RL. We evaluate DIVO on the D4RL benchmark and compare it against state-of-the-art baselines. Empirical results demonstrate that DIVO achieves superior performance, delivering significant improvements in average returns across locomotion tasks and outperforming existing methods in the challenging AntMaze domain, where sparse rewards pose a major difficulty.

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) for neural networks on tabular data is critical to a wide range of applications, yet it remains challenging due to large, non-convex search spaces and the cost of exhaustive tuning. We introduce the Quantum-Inspired Bilevel Optimizer for Neural Networks (QIBONN), a bilevel framework that encodes feature selection, architectural hyperparameters, and regularization in a unified qubit-based representation. By combining deterministic quantum-inspired rotations with stochastic qubit mutations guided by a global attractor, QIBONN balances exploration and exploitation under a fixed evaluation budget. We conduct systematic experiments under single-qubit bit-flip noise (0.1\%--1\%) emulated by an IBM-Q backend. Results on 13 real-world datasets indicate that QIBONN is competitive with established methods, including classical tree-based methods and both classical/quantum-inspired HPO algorithms under the same tuning budget.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过准确重构潜在表示中的触发激活变化(TAC)值来移除后门攻击的新方法，通过凸二次优化问题求解最小扰动，识别中毒类别并微调模型以消除后门。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法基于触发激活变化(TAC)识别和移除后门神经元，但由于TAC值估计不准确导致识别精度低。需要更准确的方法来重构TAC值以有效防御后门攻击。

Method: 将最小扰动问题建模为凸二次优化问题，其最优解作为TAC的替代。通过检测统计上小的L2范数扰动来识别中毒类别，并在微调过程中利用该扰动移除后门。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、GTSRB和TinyImageNet数据集上的实验表明，该方法在不同攻击类型、数据集和架构下都能实现优越的后门抑制效果，同时保持高清洁准确率，优于现有防御方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法通过准确重构TAC值，能够有效识别和移除后门，在各种实验设置下都表现出优异的防御性能。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a critical threat to machine learning models, causing them to behave normally on clean data but misclassify poisoned data into a poisoned class. Existing defenses often attempt to identify and remove backdoor neurons based on Trigger-Activated Changes (TAC) which is the activation differences between clean and poisoned data. These methods suffer from low precision in identifying true backdoor neurons due to inaccurate estimation of TAC values. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor removal method by accurately reconstructing TAC values in the latent representation. Specifically, we formulate the minimal perturbation that forces clean data to be classified into a specific class as a convex quadratic optimization problem, whose optimal solution serves as a surrogate for TAC. We then identify the poisoned class by detecting statistically small $L^2$ norms of perturbations and leverage the perturbation of the poisoned class in fine-tuning to remove backdoors. Experiments on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and TinyImageNet demonstrated that our approach consistently achieves superior backdoor suppression with high clean accuracy across different attack types, datasets, and architectures, outperforming existing defense methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的条件变分自编码器（CVAE）方法，通过使用归一化流估计潜在空间的条件分布，解决了传统CVAE生成图像模糊和多样性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管扩散模型已成为生成模型的新标准，但传统变分自编码器仍有改进空间。传统CVAE假设潜在空间的条件分布等于先验分布，这在现实中不成立，导致图像生成质量受限。

Method: 使用归一化流来估计潜在空间的条件分布，并将高斯解码器的方差作为可训练参数，从而提高图像生成质量。

Result: 相比现有方法，FID降低了5%，对数似然提高了7.7%，表明图像生成质量显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过正确估计潜在空间的条件分布，传统CVAE仍能实现有竞争力的图像生成性能，为传统生成模型的改进提供了新思路。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks remained the state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models until 2022. Now they are superseded by diffusion based models. Efforts to improve traditional models have stagnated as a result. In old-school fashion, we explore image generation with conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE) to incorporate desired attributes within the images. VAEs are known to produce blurry images with less diversity, we refer a method that solve this issue by leveraging the variance of the gaussian decoder as a learnable parameter during training. Previous works on CVAEs assumed that the conditional distribution of the latent space given the labels is equal to the prior distribution, which is not the case in reality. We show that estimating it using normalizing flows results in better image generation than existing methods by reducing the FID by 5% and increasing log likelihood by 7.7% than the previous case.

Motivation: 现有方法通常对添加的适配器模块应用贝叶斯推断，而Bayesian-MoE直接针对MoE模型中已有的专家路径，利用其模块化设计进行可处理的块级后验估计。

Method: 对每个专家的第二个线性层应用结构化拉普拉斯近似，使用克罗内克分解低秩近似来建模曲率，并推导可扩展的预测不确定性和边际似然估计。

Result: 在Qwen1.5-MoE和DeepSeek-MoE上的常识推理基准测试表明，Bayesian-MoE在预期校准误差（ECE）和负对数似然（NLL）方面均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Bayesian-MoE为可靠的下游决策提供了有效的后验不确定性估计框架，无需修改原始训练过程或引入新参数。

Abstract: We present Bayesian Mixture of Experts (Bayesian-MoE), a post-hoc uncertainty estimation framework for fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) based on Mixture-of-Experts architectures. Our method applies a structured Laplace approximation to the second linear layer of each expert, enabling calibrated uncertainty estimation without modifying the original training procedure or introducing new parameters. Unlike prior approaches, which apply Bayesian inference to added adapter modules, Bayesian-MoE directly targets the expert pathways already present in MoE models, leveraging their modular design for tractable block-wise posterior estimation. We use Kronecker-factored low-rank approximations to model curvature and derive scalable estimates of predictive uncertainty and marginal likelihood. Experiments on common-sense reasoning benchmarks with Qwen1.5-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE demonstrate that Bayesian-MoE improves both expected calibration error (ECE) and negative log-likelihood (NLL) over baselines, confirming its effectiveness for reliable downstream decision-making.

Motivation: 现有稀疏混合专家模型依赖辅助损失和额外参数来促进专家多样性，导致目标错位和模型复杂度增加；现有Sinkhorn方法训练开销大。

Method: 将token到专家分配建模为最优传输问题，直接从传输图中推导门控分数，提出SSR路由机制替代辅助损失。

Conclusion: SSR通过轻量级最优传输路由有效平衡token分配，无需辅助平衡损失，提升了稀疏混合专家模型的性能和效率。

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) has gained prominence as a scalable and computationally efficient architecture, enabling significant growth in model capacity without incurring additional inference costs. However, existing SMoE models often rely on auxiliary losses (e.g., z-loss, load balancing) and additional trainable parameters (e.g., noisy gating) to encourage expert diversity, leading to objective misalignment and increased model complexity. Moreover, existing Sinkhorn-based methods suffer from significant training overhead due to their heavy reliance on the computationally expensive Sinkhorn algorithm. In this work, we formulate token-to-expert assignment as an optimal transport problem, incorporating constraints to ensure balanced expert utilization. We demonstrate that introducing a minimal degree of optimal transport-based routing enhances SMoE performance without requiring auxiliary balancing losses. Unlike previous methods, our approach derives gating scores directly from the transport map, enabling more effective token-to-expert balancing, supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. Building on these insights, we propose Selective Sinkhorn Routing (SSR), a routing mechanism that replaces auxiliary loss with lightweight Sinkhorn-based routing. SSR promotes balanced token assignments while preserving flexibility in expert selection. Across both language modeling and image classification tasks, SSR achieves faster training, higher accuracy, and greater robustness to input corruption.

Conclusion: BRIDGE设计将试验转变为适应性、模块化研究，使每个模型迭代都能生成I级证据，加速AI在常规护理中的成本效益转化。

Abstract: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are indispensable for establishing the clinical value of medical artificial-intelligence (AI) tools, yet their high cost and long timelines hinder timely validation as new models emerge rapidly. Here, we propose BRIDGE, a data-reuse RCT design for AI-based risk models. AI risk models support a broad range of interventions, including screening, treatment selection, and clinical alerts. BRIDGE trials recycle participant-level data from completed trials of AI models when legacy and updated models make concordant predictions, thereby reducing the enrollment requirement for subsequent trials. We provide a practical checklist for investigators to assess whether reusing data from previous trials allows for valid causal inference and preserves type I error. Using real-world datasets across breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and sepsis, we demonstrate concordance between successive AI models, with up to 64.8% overlap in top 5% high-risk cohorts. We then simulate a series of breast cancer screening studies, where our design reduced required enrollment by 46.6%--saving over US$2.8 million--while maintaining 80% power. By transforming trials into adaptive, modular studies, our proposed design makes Level I evidence generation feasible for every model iteration, thereby accelerating cost-effective translation of AI into routine care.

Abstract: We introduce a novel, efficient framework for clustering data on high-dimensional, non-Euclidean manifolds that overcomes the computational challenges associated with standard intrinsic methods. The key innovation is the use of the $p$-Fréchet map $F^p : \mathcal{M} \to \mathbb{R}^\ell$ -- defined on a generic metric space $\mathcal{M}$ -- which embeds the manifold data into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^\ell$ using a set of reference points $\{r_i\}_{i=1}^\ell$, $r_i \in \mathcal{M}$. Once embedded, we can efficiently and accurately apply standard Euclidean clustering techniques such as k-means. We rigorously analyze the mathematical properties of $F^p$ in the Euclidean space and the challenging manifold of $n \times n$ symmetric positive definite matrices $\mathit{SPD}(n)$. Extensive numerical experiments using synthetic and real $\mathit{SPD}(n)$ data demonstrate significant performance gains: our method reduces runtime by up to two orders of magnitude compared to intrinsic manifold-based approaches, all while maintaining high clustering accuracy, including scenarios where existing alternative methods struggle or fail.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have impressive data fusion and reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving (AD). However, training LLMs for AD faces significant challenges including high computation transmission costs, and privacy concerns associated with sensitive driving data. Federated Learning (FL) is promising for enabling autonomous vehicles (AVs) to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. We present Federated LLM-based Autonomous Driving (FLAD), an FL framework that leverages distributed multimodal sensory data across AVs in heterogeneous environment. FLAD has three key innovations: (1) a cloud-edge-vehicle collaborative architecture that reduces communication delay and preserving data privacy; (2) an intelligent parallelized collaborative training with a communication scheduling mechanism that optimizes training efficiency, leveraging end-devices otherwise having insufficient resources for model training; and (3) a knowledge distillation method that personalizes LLM according to heterogeneous edge data. In addition, we prototype FLAD in a testbed with NVIDIA Jetsons, overcoming practical implementation challenges including CPU/GPU memory sharing in resource-constrained devices, dynamic model partitions, and fault-tolerant training.Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that FLAD achieves superior end-to-end AD performance while efficiently utilizing distributed vehicular resources, opening up new possibilities for future collaborative AD model training and knowledge sharing.

Motivation: 联邦学习面临数据分布差异（如协变量偏移和语义偏移）的挑战，这影响了其在真实部署中的可靠性。现有不变学习方法在准确捕捉不变特征和直接构建因果表示方面存在局限性。

Method: FedSDWC是一种因果推理方法，整合了不变特征和可变特征。它通过建模不变特征和可变特征之间的弱因果影响来推断因果语义表示，克服了现有方法的局限性。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验验证了FedSDWC在处理协变量和语义偏移方面的优越性能。例如，在CIFAR-10上平均比次优基线FedICON高出3.04%，在CIFAR-100上高出8.11%。

Conclusion: FedSDWC显著增强了联邦学习的泛化能力和OOD数据检测能力，理论上推导了其泛化误差界，并首次建立了与客户端先验分布的关系。

Abstract: Amid growing demands for data privacy and advances in computational infrastructure, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent distributed learning paradigm. Nevertheless, differences in data distribution (such as covariate and semantic shifts) severely affect its reliability in real-world deployments. To address this issue, we propose FedSDWC, a causal inference method that integrates both invariant and variant features. FedSDWC infers causal semantic representations by modeling the weak causal influence between invariant and variant features, effectively overcoming the limitations of existing invariant learning methods in accurately capturing invariant features and directly constructing causal representations. This approach significantly enhances FL's ability to generalize and detect OOD data. Theoretically, we derive FedSDWC's generalization error bound under specific conditions and, for the first time, establish its relationship with client prior distributions. Moreover, extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of FedSDWC in handling covariate and semantic shifts. For example, FedSDWC outperforms FedICON, the next best baseline, by an average of 3.04% on CIFAR-10 and 8.11% on CIFAR-100.

We also release SAVSD, a smartphone-captured dataset with gender annotations, designed to support fairness research in low-resource, real-world contexts. Together, these contributions position FairM2S as a state-of-the-art approach for equitable and scalable few-shot stress detection in mental health AI. We release our dataset and FairM2S publicly with this paper.

Motivation: 现代预训练语言模型的表示空间具有高度非线性和几何结构，文本嵌入位于弯曲的语义流形上。线性聚合会扭曲几何结构，导致语义漂移，使聚合表示偏离内在流形，损失语义保真度和表达能力。

Conclusion: 流形感知聚合在文本属性图学习中具有重要意义，测地线聚合方法能有效保持语义表示的几何结构完整性。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) on text--attributed graphs (TAGs) typically encode node texts using pretrained language models (PLMs) and propagate these embeddings through linear neighborhood aggregation. However, the representation spaces of modern PLMs are highly non--linear and geometrically structured, where textual embeddings reside on curved semantic manifolds rather than flat Euclidean spaces. Linear aggregation on such manifolds inevitably distorts geometry and causes semantic drift--a phenomenon where aggregated representations deviate from the intrinsic manifold, losing semantic fidelity and expressive power. To quantitatively investigate this problem, this work introduces a local PCA--based metric that measures the degree of semantic drift and provides the first quantitative framework to analyze how different aggregation mechanisms affect manifold structure. Building upon these insights, we propose Geodesic Aggregation, a manifold--aware mechanism that aggregates neighbor information along geodesics via log--exp mappings on the unit sphere, ensuring that representations remain faithful to the semantic manifold during message passing. We further develop GeoGNN, a practical instantiation that integrates spherical attention with manifold interpolation. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets and multiple text encoders show that GeoGNN substantially mitigates semantic drift and consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing the importance of manifold--aware aggregation in text--attributed graph learning.

Abstract: Interactive preference elicitation (IPE) aims to substantially reduce human effort while acquiring human preferences in wide personalization systems. Dueling bandit (DB) algorithms enable optimal decision-making in IPE building on pairwise comparisons. However, they remain inefficient when human feedback is sparse. Existing methods address sparsity by heavily relying on parametric reward models, whose rigid assumptions are vulnerable to misspecification. In contrast, we explore an alternative perspective based on feedback augmentation, and introduce critical improvements to the model-free DB framework. Specifically, we introduce augmented confidence bounds to integrate augmented human feedback under generalized concentration properties, and analyze the multi-factored performance trade-off via regret analysis. Our prototype algorithm achieves competitive performance across several IPE benchmarks, including recommendation, multi-objective optimization, and response optimization for large language models, demonstrating the potential of our approach for provably efficient IPE in broader applications.

*Anthony Baez,Wang Zhang,Ziwen Ma,Lam Nguyen,Subhro Das,Luca Daniel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种保证物理信息神经网络(PINNs)中积分量守恒的投影方法，通过求解约束非线性优化问题推导投影公式，显著提高守恒精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs使用软约束强制偏微分方程结构，虽然提供了训练灵活性，但也允许发现解违反物理定律，因此需要保证积分量守恒。

Method: 引入投影方法保证线性和二次积分的守恒，通过求解约束非线性优化问题推导投影公式，称为PINN-Proj。

Result: 与软约束相比，PINN-Proj将守恒误差降低了3-4个数量级，并略微降低了PDE解误差，同时改善了损失景观条件促进收敛。

Conclusion: 该方法为在PINNs中保证任何积分量守恒提供了一个通用框架，只要存在可处理的解。

Abstract: We propose a novel projection method that guarantees the conservation of integral quantities in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). While the soft constraint that PINNs use to enforce the structure of partial differential equations (PDEs) enables necessary flexibility during training, it also permits the discovered solution to violate physical laws. To address this, we introduce a projection method that guarantees the conservation of the linear and quadratic integrals, both separately and jointly. We derived the projection formulae by solving constrained non-linear optimization problems and found that our PINN modified with the projection, which we call PINN-Proj, reduced the error in the conservation of these quantities by three to four orders of magnitude compared to the soft constraint and marginally reduced the PDE solution error. We also found evidence that the projection improved convergence through improving the conditioning of the loss landscape. Our method holds promise as a general framework to guarantee the conservation of any integral quantity in a PINN if a tractable solution exists.

TL;DR: 提出了一种学习可定制距离度量的方法，打破分类属性类别间的固有关系约束，显著提升聚类算法对多样化聚类分布的适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分类属性缺乏明确的类别间关系定义，限制了紧凑分类数据簇的发现。现有方法通常假设固定的类别拓扑关系，难以适应变化的聚类结构。

Method: 打破属性类别的内在关系约束，学习适合灵活准确揭示各种聚类分布的自定义距离度量，使类别关系可学习且与欧氏距离度量兼容。

Result: 在12个真实基准数据集上的比较实验显示，所提方法的平均排名为1.25，显著优于当前最佳方法的5.21排名。

Conclusion: 通过学习可定制的距离度量，显著增强了聚类算法的拟合能力，并能无缝扩展到包含数值和分类属性的混合数据集。

Abstract: Categorical attributes with qualitative values are ubiquitous in cluster analysis of real datasets. Unlike the Euclidean distance of numerical attributes, the categorical attributes lack well-defined relationships of their possible values (also called categories interchangeably), which hampers the exploration of compact categorical data clusters. Although most attempts are made for developing appropriate distance metrics, they typically assume a fixed topological relationship between categories when learning distance metrics, which limits their adaptability to varying cluster structures and often leads to suboptimal clustering performance. This paper, therefore, breaks the intrinsic relationship tie of attribute categories and learns customized distance metrics suitable for flexibly and accurately revealing various cluster distributions. As a result, the fitting ability of the clustering algorithm is significantly enhanced, benefiting from the learnable category relationships. Moreover, the learned category relationships are proved to be Euclidean distance metric-compatible, enabling a seamless extension to mixed datasets that include both numerical and categorical attributes. Comparative experiments on 12 real benchmark datasets with significance tests show the superior clustering accuracy of the proposed method with an average ranking of 1.25, which is significantly higher than the 5.21 ranking of the current best-performing method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLM生成的标签存在质量低（标签噪声）和缺乏纠错机制的双重限制，需要一种既能提高标注质量又能减少人工成本的方法。

Method: 提出HCL设置，仅对VLM存在分歧的实例进行人工修正；理论推导风险一致性估计器，结合人工修正标签和VLM预测训练分类器；提出条件概率方法估计标签分布。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法实现了优越的分类性能，并对标签噪声具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: HCL在实际弱监督场景中有效，能够平衡标注质量和成本效益。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), with their powerful content generation capabilities, have been successfully applied to data annotation processes. However, the VLM-generated labels exhibit dual limitations: low quality (i.e., label noise) and absence of error correction mechanisms. To enhance label quality, we propose Human-Corrected Labels (HCLs), a novel setting that efficient human correction for VLM-generated noisy labels. As shown in Figure 1(b), HCL strategically deploys human correction only for instances with VLM discrepancies, achieving both higher-quality annotations and reduced labor costs. Specifically, we theoretically derive a risk-consistent estimator that incorporates both human-corrected labels and VLM predictions to train classifiers. Besides, we further propose a conditional probability method to estimate the label distribution using a combination of VLM outputs and model predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior classification performance and is robust to label noise, validating the effectiveness of HCL in practical weak supervision scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过学习重排序网络来最小化LU分解中三角因子l1范数的方法，以近似减少填充元素数量，在基准测试中相比现有方法减少了20%的填充数量和17.8%的LU分解时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型稀疏矩阵LU分解过程中产生的填充元素会增加内存使用和计算时间，虽然通过矩阵重排序可以减少填充元素，但找到最优排列是NP难问题，现有方法缺乏理论保证。

Method: 使用图编码器预测行列节点分数，通过重参数化技术从节点分数获得置换矩阵，将矩阵重排序后引入分解过程到目标函数中，使用交替方向乘子法和近端梯度下降优化整体目标函数。

Result: 在SuiteSparse基准稀疏矩阵集合上的实验结果显示，相比最先进的基线方法，填充元素数量和LU分解时间分别减少了20%和17.8%。

Conclusion: 提出的重排序网络方法能有效减少LU分解中的填充元素，提高计算效率，在稀疏矩阵处理中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Fill-ins are new nonzero elements in the summation of the upper and lower triangular factors generated during LU factorization. For large sparse matrices, they will increase the memory usage and computational time, and be reduced through proper row or column arrangement, namely matrix reordering. Finding a row or column permutation with the minimal fill-ins is NP-hard, and surrogate objectives are designed to derive fill-in reduction permutations or learn a reordering function. However, there is no theoretical guarantee between the golden criterion and these surrogate objectives. Here we propose to learn a reordering network by minimizing \(l_1\) norm of triangular factors of the reordered matrix to approximate the exact number of fill-ins. The reordering network utilizes a graph encoder to predict row or column node scores. For inference, it is easy and fast to derive the permutation from sorting algorithms for matrices. For gradient based optimization, there is a large gap between the predicted node scores and resultant triangular factors in the optimization objective. To bridge the gap, we first design two reparameterization techniques to obtain the permutation matrix from node scores. The matrix is reordered by multiplying the permutation matrix. Then we introduce the factorization process into the objective function to arrive at target triangular factors. The overall objective function is optimized with the alternating direction method of multipliers and proximal gradient descent. Experimental results on benchmark sparse matrix collection SuiteSparse show the fill-in number and LU factorization time reduction of our proposed method is 20% and 17.8% compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出FedPM方法，通过服务器端的预条件混合解决联邦学习中局部预条件器漂移问题，实现二阶优化的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习二阶优化方法（如LocalNewton、LTDA、FedSophia）在异构数据环境下存在局部预条件器漂移问题，严重影响参数训练的收敛性。

Method: 将理想二阶更新分解为服务器端参数混合和客户端局部参数更新，在服务器端引入预条件混合机制。

Result: 理论分析显示在强凸目标和单次局部更新场景下具有超线性收敛速率；实验表明相比传统方法显著提升测试准确率。

Conclusion: FedPM通过预条件混合有效缓解局部预条件器漂移，充分发挥二阶优化在联邦学习中的潜力。

Abstract: We propose Federated Preconditioned Mixing (FedPM), a novel Federated Learning (FL) method that leverages second-order optimization. Prior methods--such as LocalNewton, LTDA, and FedSophia--have incorporated second-order optimization in FL by performing iterative local updates on clients and applying simple mixing of local parameters on the server. However, these methods often suffer from drift in local preconditioners, which significantly disrupts the convergence of parameter training, particularly in heterogeneous data settings. To overcome this issue, we refine the update rules by decomposing the ideal second-order update--computed using globally preconditioned global gradients--into parameter mixing on the server and local parameter updates on clients. As a result, our FedPM introduces preconditioned mixing of local parameters on the server, effectively mitigating drift in local preconditioners.
  We provide a theoretical convergence analysis demonstrating a superlinear rate for strongly convex objectives in scenarios involving a single local update. To demonstrate the practical benefits of FedPM, we conducted extensive experiments. The results showed significant improvements with FedPM in the test accuracy compared to conventional methods incorporating simple mixing, fully leveraging the potential of second-order optimization.

Motivation: 理解LLM在RLHF/DPO对齐过程中的理论脆弱性，填补现有经验研究缺乏理论基础的空白。

Method: 将最小成本投毒攻击建模为带线性约束的凸优化问题，推导攻击成本的上下界，并提出成本最小化后处理方法。

Result: 理论分析显示当奖励模型特征维度相对于数据集大小较小时，投毒成本可以显著降低；实证结果验证了后处理方法能有效减少标签翻转次数。

Conclusion: RLHF/DPO流程存在基本脆弱性，本文提供的工具可用于评估其对低成本投毒攻击的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems, making it critical to understand their vulnerabilities. While data poisoning attacks during RLHF/DPO alignment have been studied empirically, their theoretical foundations remain unclear. We investigate the minimum-cost poisoning attack required to steer an LLM's policy toward an attacker's target by flipping preference labels during RLHF/DPO, without altering the compared outputs. We formulate this as a convex optimization problem with linear constraints, deriving lower and upper bounds on the minimum attack cost. As a byproduct of this theoretical analysis, we show that any existing label-flipping attack can be post-processed via our proposed method to reduce the number of label flips required while preserving the intended poisoning effect. Empirical results demonstrate that this cost-minimization post-processing can significantly reduce poisoning costs over baselines, particularly when the reward model's feature dimension is small relative to the dataset size. These findings highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in RLHF/DPO pipelines and provide tools to evaluate their robustness against low-cost poisoning attacks.

Motivation: 现有的深度强化学习网络防御代理在拓扑或规模变化时需要重新训练，难以适应现实网络中不断变化的拓扑和规模。

Conclusion: TERLA方法实现了网络防御代理的通用性，无需重新训练即可适应不同网络拓扑和规模，缩小了仿真与现实的差距。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning for autonomous cyber defence have resulted in agents that can successfully defend simulated computer networks against cyber-attacks. However, many of these agents would need retraining to defend networks with differing topology or size, making them poorly suited to real-world networks where topology and size can vary over time. In this research we introduce a novel set of Topological Extensions for Reinforcement Learning Agents (TERLA) that provide generalisability for the defence of networks with differing topology and size, without the need for retraining. Our approach involves the use of heterogeneous graph neural network layers to produce a fixed-size latent embedding representing the observed network state. This representation learning stage is coupled with a reduced, fixed-size, semantically meaningful and interpretable action space. We apply TERLA to a standard deep reinforcement learning Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) agent model, and to reduce the sim-to-real gap, conduct our research using Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenge 4. This Cyber Operations Research Gym environment has many of the features of a real-world network, such as realistic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) events and multiple agents defending network segments of differing topology and size. TERLA agents retain the defensive performance of vanilla PPO agents whilst showing improved action efficiency. Generalisability has been demonstrated by showing that all TERLA agents have the same network-agnostic neural network architecture, and by deploying a single TERLA agent multiple times to defend network segments with differing topology and size, showing improved defensive performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Class imbalance has been extensively studied in single-view scenarios; however, addressing this challenge in multi-view contexts remains an open problem, with even scarcer research focusing on trustworthy solutions. In this paper, we tackle a particularly challenging class imbalance problem in multi-view scenarios: long-tailed classification. We propose TMLC, a Trusted Multi-view Long-tailed Classification framework, which makes contributions on two critical aspects: opinion aggregation and pseudo-data generation. Specifically, inspired by Social Identity Theory, we design a group consensus opinion aggregation mechanism that guides decision making toward the direction favored by the majority of the group. In terms of pseudo-data generation, we introduce a novel distance metric to adapt SMOTE for multi-view scenarios and develop an uncertainty-guided data generation module that produces high-quality pseudo-data, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of class imbalance. Extensive experiments on long-tailed multi-view datasets demonstrate that our model is capable of achieving superior performance. The code is released at https://github.com/cncq-tang/TMLC.

Conclusion: 所提框架有效解决了现有GPR不确定性边界的局限性，提供了更紧的全局边界和适应局部结构的局部不确定性量化，在理论和实验上均表现出优越性。

Abstract: Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a popular nonparametric Bayesian method that provides predictive uncertainty estimates and is widely used in safety-critical applications. While prior research has introduced various uncertainty bounds, most existing approaches require access to specific input features and rely on posterior mean and variance estimates or tuning hyperparameters. These limitations hinder robustness and fail to capture the model's global behavior in expectation. To address these limitations, we propose a chaining-based framework for estimating upper and lower bounds on the expected extreme values over unseen data, without requiring access to specific input locations. We provide kernel-specific refinements for commonly used kernels such as RBF and Matérn, in which our bounds are tighter than generic constructions. We further improve numerical tightness by avoiding analytical relaxations. In addition to global estimation, we also develop a novel method for local uncertainty quantification at specified inputs. This approach leverages chaining geometry through partition diameters, adapting to local structure without relying on posterior variance scaling. Our experimental results validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言作为LLM智能体间的通信媒介存在根本性限制，将丰富的内部潜在状态降采样为离散token会限制信息传输的深度和细微差别，从而阻碍协作问题解决。

Method: 利用LLM的最后一个隐藏状态作为心智表示进行直接传输（潜在通信），并通过额外的压缩过程在完全潜在空间中进行推理来进一步压缩潜在通信。

Result: 实验表明Interlat优于微调的思维链提示和单智能体基线，促进了更多探索性行为并实现了对潜在信息的真正利用。进一步压缩不仅显著加速推理，还通过高效的信息保留机制保持了竞争力。

Conclusion: 这项工作是对完全潜在空间智能体间通信的可行性研究，结果突显了其潜力，为未来研究提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: While natural language is the de facto communication medium for LLM-based agents, it presents a fundamental constraint. The process of downsampling rich, internal latent states into discrete tokens inherently limits the depth and nuance of information that can be transmitted, thereby hindering collaborative problem-solving. Inspired by human mind-reading, we propose Interlat (Inter-agent Latent Space Communication), a paradigm that leverages the last hidden states of an LLM as a representation of its mind for direct transmission (termed latent communication). An additional compression process further compresses latent communication via entirely latent space reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that Interlat outperforms both fine-tuned chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and single-agent baselines, promoting more exploratory behavior and enabling genuine utilization of latent information. Further compression not only substantially accelerates inference but also maintains competitive performance through an efficient information-preserving mechanism. We position this work as a feasibility study of entirely latent space inter-agent communication, and our results highlight its potential, offering valuable insights for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督特征选择方法通常单独评估特征，但实际中信息信号往往来自相关特征组。现有方法要么依赖预定义分组，要么需要标签监督，限制了应用范围。

Method: 提出GroupFS框架，在特征图和样本图上强制执行拉普拉斯平滑，并应用组稀疏正则化器来学习紧凑的结构化表示。

Result: 在9个基准数据集（包括图像、表格数据和生物数据集）上，GroupFS在聚类任务中始终优于最先进的无监督特征选择方法，并选择出与有意义模式对齐的特征组。

Conclusion: GroupFS能够有效发现和选择特征组，在无监督特征选择任务中表现优异，所选特征组与有意义的模式保持一致。

Abstract: Unsupervised feature selection (FS) is essential for high-dimensional learning tasks where labels are not available. It helps reduce noise, improve generalization, and enhance interpretability. However, most existing unsupervised FS methods evaluate features in isolation, even though informative signals often emerge from groups of related features. For example, adjacent pixels, functionally connected brain regions, or correlated financial indicators tend to act together, making independent evaluation suboptimal. Although some methods attempt to capture group structure, they typically rely on predefined partitions or label supervision, limiting their applicability. We propose GroupFS, an end-to-end, fully differentiable framework that jointly discovers latent feature groups and selects the most informative groups among them, without relying on fixed a priori groups or label supervision. GroupFS enforces Laplacian smoothness on both feature and sample graphs and applies a group sparsity regularizer to learn a compact, structured representation. Across nine benchmarks spanning images, tabular data, and biological datasets, GroupFS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised FS in clustering and selects groups of features that align with meaningful patterns.

Result: 在Split-ImageNet任务上，仅使用0.3%数据大小的记忆就能达到60%准确率（相比经验回放的30%），使用2%记忆时准确率提升到74%，接近批量训练的77.6%。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建紧凑记忆开辟了新方向，未来也可用于深度持续学习。

Abstract: Despite recent progress, continual learning still does not match the performance of batch training. To avoid catastrophic forgetting, we need to build compact memory of essential past knowledge, but no clear solution has yet emerged, even for shallow neural networks with just one or two layers. In this paper, we present a new method to build compact memory for logistic regression. Our method is based on a result by Khan and Swaroop [2021] who show the existence of optimal memory for such models. We formulate the search for the optimal memory as Hessian-matching and propose a probabilistic PCA method to estimate them. Our approach can drastically improve accuracy compared to Experience Replay. For instance, on Split-ImageNet, we get 60% accuracy compared to 30% obtained by replay with memory-size equivalent to 0.3% of the data size. Increasing the memory size to 2% further boosts the accuracy to 74%, closing the gap to the batch accuracy of 77.6% on this task. Our work opens a new direction for building compact memory that can also be useful in the future for continual deep learning.

Result: 在D4RL风格控制任务的重力、运动学和形态学变化中，DFDT相比强离线RL和序列模型基线，在回报和稳定性方面均有提升，并通过令牌拼接和序列语义稳定性分析验证了这些收益。

Conclusion: DFDT通过恢复轨迹片段的拼接性，有效解决了决策变换器在跨域迁移中的挑战，理论分析表明状态值和策略性能差距与MMD不匹配和OT偏差度量相关，且随着这些度量的减小而收紧。

Abstract: Cross-domain shifts present a significant challenge for decision transformer (DT) policies. Existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods typically rely on a single simple filtering criterion to select source trajectory fragments and stitch them together. They match either state structure or action feasibility. However, the selected fragments still have poor stitchability: state structures can misalign, the return-to-go (RTG) becomes incomparable when the reward or horizon changes, and actions may jump at trajectory junctions. As a result, RTG tokens lose continuity, which compromises DT's inference ability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer (DFDT), a compact pipeline that restores stitchability. Particularly, DFDT fuses scarce target data with selectively trusted source fragments via a two-level data filter, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) mismatch for state-structure alignment, and optimal transport (OT) deviation for action feasibility. It then trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. Furthermore, DFDT replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, which improves the continuity of the semantics in the token sequence. It also applies a $Q$-guided regularizer to suppress junction value and action jumps. Theoretically, we provide bounds that tie state value and policy performance gaps to the MMD-mismatch and OT-deviation measures, and show that the bounds tighten as these two measures shrink. We show that DFDT improves return and stability over strong offline RL and sequence-model baselines across gravity, kinematic, and morphology shifts on D4RL-style control tasks, and further corroborate these gains with token-stitching and sequence-semantics stability analyses.

TL;DR: FSampler是一个无需训练、与采样器无关的执行层，通过减少函数评估次数来加速扩散采样。它利用历史去噪信号预测下一个epsilon，在特定步骤替代模型调用，同时保持采样器更新规则不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型采样过程需要大量函数评估，计算成本高昂。FSampler旨在在不改变采样器公式的情况下，通过预测机制减少模型调用次数，从而加速采样过程。

Method: FSampler维护最近模型调用的去噪信号历史，使用有限差分预测器（二阶、三阶或四阶）外推下一个epsilon。在选定步骤用预测的epsilon替代模型调用，包含验证机制、学习稳定器和梯度估计稳定器来确保稳定性。

Result: 在FLUX.1 dev、Qwen Image和Wan 2.2等模型上，FSampler将时间减少8-22%，模型调用减少15-25%，同时保持高保真度（SSIM 0.95-0.99）。在激进模式下，模型调用可减少45-50%，但保真度较低（SSIM 0.73-0.74）。

Conclusion: FSampler提供了一种有效的扩散采样加速方法，兼容多种采样器，无需重新训练，在保持高质量的同时显著减少计算成本。

Abstract: FSampler is a training free, sampler agnostic execution layer that accelerates diffusion sampling by reducing the number of function evaluations (NFE). FSampler maintains a short history of denoising signals (epsilon) from recent real model calls and extrapolates the next epsilon using finite difference predictors at second order, third order, or fourth order, falling back to lower order when history is insufficient. On selected steps the predicted epsilon substitutes the model call while keeping each sampler's update rule unchanged. Predicted epsilons are validated for finiteness and magnitude; a learning stabilizer rescales predictions on skipped steps to correct drift, and an optional gradient estimation stabilizer compensates local curvature. Protected windows, periodic anchors, and a cap on consecutive skips bound deviation over the trajectory. Operating at the sampler level, FSampler integrates with Euler/DDIM, DPM++ 2M/2S, LMS/AB2, and RES family exponential multistep methods and drops into standard workflows. FLUX.1 dev, Qwen Image, and Wan 2.2, FSampler reduces time by 8 to 22% and model calls by 15 to 25% at high fidelity (Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) 0.95 to 0.99), without altering sampler formulas. With an aggressive adaptive gate, reductions can reach 45 to 50% fewer model calls at lower fidelity (SSIM 0.73 to 0.74).

Abstract: Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) can lift the burden of tuning hyperparameters (HPs) of neural networks. HPO algorithms from the Population Based Training (PBT) family are efficient thanks to dynamically adjusting HPs every few steps of the weight optimization. Recent results indicate that the number of steps between HP updates is an important meta-HP of all PBT variants that can substantially affect their performance. Yet, no method or intuition is available for efficiently setting its value. We introduce Iterated Population Based Training (IPBT), a novel PBT variant that automatically adjusts this HP via restarts that reuse weight information in a task-agnostic way and leverage time-varying Bayesian optimization to reinitialize HPs. Evaluation on 8 image classification and reinforcement learning tasks shows that, on average, our algorithm matches or outperforms 5 previous PBT variants and other HPO algorithms (random search, ASHA, SMAC3), without requiring a budget increase or any changes to its HPs.

Motivation: 现有AI生成文本检测器训练数据集存在质量问题，DetectRL基准中98.5%的Claude-LLM数据包含简单生成模式，这些模式可能被检测器用作捷径，导致易受欺骗攻击。

Method: 对DetectRL数据集进行多种清洗操作，移除包含典型AI生成模式（如开头语"Sure! Here is..."或任务拒绝）的样本。

Conclusion: 数据质量对AI文本检测器性能至关重要，清洗后的数据集已公开可用，有助于开发更可靠的检测方法。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for many applications. To prevent illicit use, it is desirable to be able to detect AI-generated text. Training and evaluation of such detectors critically depend on suitable benchmark datasets. Several groups took on the tedious work of collecting, curating, and publishing large and diverse datasets for this task. However, it remains an open challenge to ensure high quality in all relevant aspects of such a dataset. For example, the DetectRL benchmark exhibits relatively simple patterns of AI-generation in 98.5% of the Claude-LLM data. These patterns may include introductory words such as "Sure! Here is the academic article abstract:", or instances where the LLM rejects the prompted task. In this work, we demonstrate that detectors trained on such data use such patterns as shortcuts, which facilitates spoofing attacks on the trained detectors. We consequently reprocessed the DetectRL dataset with several cleansing operations. Experiments show that such data cleansing makes direct attacks more difficult. The reprocessed dataset is publicly available.

TL;DR: CoCo-MILP通过建模变量间的对比和约束内的竞争关系，显著提升了混合整数线性规划问题的求解效率，将求解差距降低了68.12%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图神经网络的方法在MILP问题求解中存在两个层面的不对齐问题：学习目标层面，二元交叉熵损失独立处理变量，忽略了相对优先级；模型架构层面，标准GNN消息传递平滑了变量表示，忽略了约束内的竞争关系。

Result: 在标准基准测试上，CoCo-MILP显著优于现有的基于学习的方法，相比传统求解器将求解差距降低了68.12%。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模变量间的对比和约束内的竞争关系，CoCo-MILP能够更好地捕捉MILP问题的内在结构，为学习加速MILP求解提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a cornerstone of combinatorial optimization, yet solving large-scale instances remains a significant computational challenge. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in accelerating MILP solvers by predicting high-quality solutions. However, we identify that existing methods misalign with the intrinsic structure of MILP problems at two levels. At the leaning objective level, the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss treats variables independently, neglecting their relative priority and yielding plausible logits. At the model architecture level, standard GNN message passing inherently smooths the representations across variables, missing the natural competitive relationships within constraints. To address these challenges, we propose CoCo-MILP, which explicitly models inter-variable Contrast and intra-constraint Competition for advanced MILP solution prediction. At the objective level, CoCo-MILP introduces the Inter-Variable Contrastive Loss (VCL), which explicitly maximizes the embedding margin between variables assigned one versus zero. At the architectural level, we design an Intra-Constraint Competitive GNN layer that, instead of homogenizing features, learns to differentiate representations of competing variables within a constraint, capturing their exclusionary nature. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that CoCo-MILP significantly outperforms existing learning-based approaches, reducing the solution gap by up to 68.12% compared to traditional solvers.

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in unsupervised learning, but most existing methods heavily rely on hyperparameters such as the number of clusters or other sensitive settings, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this long-standing challenge, we propose a novel and fully parameter-free clustering framework via Self-supervised Consensus Maximization, named SCMax. Our framework performs hierarchical agglomerative clustering and cluster evaluation in a single, integrated process. At each step of agglomeration, it creates a new, structure-aware data representation through a self-supervised learning task guided by the current clustering structure. We then introduce a nearest neighbor consensus score, which measures the agreement between the nearest neighbor-based merge decisions suggested by the original representation and the self-supervised one. The moment at which consensus maximization occurs can serve as a criterion for determining the optimal number of clusters. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing clustering approaches designed for scenarios with an unknown number of clusters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型能生成真实多样的蛋白质结构，但难以控制生成结果朝向特定功能目标（如结合亲和力、序列组成）。需要一种方法能在推理时引导扩散过程实现目标导向的蛋白质设计。

Method: 将Feynman-Kac控制框架与结构生成相结合，通过计算ProteinMPNN和全原子弛豫精炼模型的奖励函数，引导采样过程朝向理想的结构或能量特征。

Result: 在结合剂设计中，FK控制能持续改善预测的界面能量学，且计算开销极小。该方法适用于各种目标，包括不可微分和奖励不可知的目标。

Conclusion: 推理时FK控制将基于扩散的蛋白质设计推广到任意、不可微分和奖励不可知的目标，为引导分子生成提供了统一且模型无关的框架。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have recently enabled the generation of realistic and diverse protein structures, yet they remain limited in their ability to steer outcomes toward specific functional or biochemical objectives, such as binding affinity or sequence composition. Here we extend the Feynman-Kac (FK) steering framework, an inference-time control approach, to diffusion-based protein design. By coupling FK steering with structure generation, the method guides sampling toward desirable structural or energetic features while maintaining the diversity of the underlying diffusion process. To enable simultaneous generation of both sequence and structure properties, rewards are computed on models refined through ProteinMPNN and all-atom relaxation. Applied to binder design, FK steering consistently improves predicted interface energetics across diverse targets with minimal computational overhead. More broadly, this work demonstrates that inference-time FK control generalizes diffusion-based protein design to arbitrary, non-differentiable, and reward-agnostic objectives, providing a unified and model-independent framework for guided molecular generation.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) lies at the core of many real-world combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, traditionally solved by branch-and-bound (B&B). A key driver influencing B&B solvers efficiency is the variable selection heuristic that guides branching decisions. Looking to move beyond static, hand-crafted heuristics, recent work has explored adapting traditional reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to the B&B setting, aiming to learn branching strategies tailored to specific MILP distributions. In parallel, RL agents have achieved remarkable success in board games, a very specific type of combinatorial problems, by leveraging environment simulators to plan via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Building on these developments, we introduce Plan-and-Branch-and-Bound (PlanB&B), a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) agent that leverages a learned internal model of the B&B dynamics to discover improved branching strategies. Computational experiments empirically validate our approach, with our MBRL branching agent outperforming previous state-of-the-art RL methods across four standard MILP benchmarks.

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in tackling combinatorial optimization problems. However, existing methods still suffer from limited accuracy when addressing that on complex graphs and exhibit poor scalability, since full training requires loading the whole adjacent matrix and all embeddings at a time, the it may results in out of memory of a single machine. This limitation significantly restricts their applicability to large-scale scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a distributed GNN-based training framework for combinatorial optimization. In details, firstly, large graph is partition into several small subgraphs. Then the individual subgraphs are full trained, providing a foundation for efficient local optimization. Finally, reinforcement learning (RL) are employed to take actions according to GNN output, to make sure the restrictions between cross nodes can be learned. Extensive experiments are conducted on both real large-scale social network datasets (e.g., Facebook, Youtube) and synthetically generated high-complexity graphs, which demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both solution quality and computational efficiency. Moreover, the experiments on large graph instances also validate the scalability of the model.

Conclusion: 研究结果为预测编码何时以及为何诱导结构化表示提供了原则性理解，弥合了经验观察与理论基础之间的差距。

Abstract: Predictive coding is a framework for understanding the formation of low-dimensional internal representations mirroring the environment's latent structure. The conditions under which such representations emerge remain unclear. In this work, we investigate how the prediction horizon and network depth shape the solutions of predictive coding tasks. Using a minimal abstract setting inspired by prior work, we show empirically and theoretically that sufficiently deep networks trained with multi-step prediction horizons consistently recover the underlying latent structure, a phenomenon explained through the Ordinary Least Squares estimator structure and biases in learning dynamics. We then extend these insights to nonlinear networks and complex datasets, including piecewise linear functions, MNIST, multiple latent states and higher dimensional state geometries. Our results provide a principled understanding of when and why predictive coding induces structured representations, bridging the gap between empirical observations and theoretical foundations.

Conclusion: DFA攻击揭示了联邦学习的新安全威胁，GuardFed提供了有效的防御方案，在保持模型效用和公平性方面达到最先进性能

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative model training but remains vulnerable to adversarial behaviors that compromise model utility or fairness across sensitive groups. While extensive studies have examined attacks targeting either objective, strategies that simultaneously degrade both utility and fairness remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Dual-Facet Attack (DFA), a novel threat model that concurrently undermines predictive accuracy and group fairness. Two variants, Synchronous DFA (S-DFA) and Split DFA (Sp-DFA), are further proposed to capture distinct real-world collusion scenarios. Experimental results show that existing robust FL defenses, including hybrid aggregation schemes, fail to resist DFAs effectively. To counter these threats, we propose GuardFed, a self-adaptive defense framework that maintains a fairness-aware reference model using a small amount of clean server data augmented with synthetic samples. In each training round, GuardFed computes a dual-perspective trust score for every client by jointly evaluating its utility deviation and fairness degradation, thereby enabling selective aggregation of trustworthy updates. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that GuardFed consistently preserves both accuracy and fairness under diverse non-IID and adversarial conditions, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared with existing robust FL methods.

Conclusion: RENTT为神经网络提供了忠实且可扩展的可解释性解决方案，通过精确的决策树转换解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Although neural networks are a powerful tool, their widespread use is hindered by the opacity of their decisions and their black-box nature, which result in a lack of trustworthiness. To alleviate this problem, methods in the field of explainable Artificial Intelligence try to unveil how such automated decisions are made. But explainable AI methods are often plagued by missing faithfulness/correctness, meaning that they sometimes provide explanations that do not align with the neural network's decision and logic. Recently, transformations to decision trees have been proposed to overcome such problems. Unfortunately, they typically lack exactness, scalability, or interpretability as the size of the neural network grows. Thus, we generalize these previous results, especially by considering convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, non-ReLU activation functions, and bias terms. Our findings are accompanied by rigorous proofs and we present a novel algorithm RENTT (Runtime Efficient Network to Tree Transformation) designed to compute an exact equivalent decision tree representation of neural networks in a manner that is both runtime and memory efficient. The resulting decision trees are multivariate and thus, possibly too complex to understand. To alleviate this problem, we also provide a method to calculate the ground truth feature importance for neural networks via the equivalent decision trees - for entire models (global), specific input regions (regional), or single decisions (local). All theoretical results are supported by detailed numerical experiments that emphasize two key aspects: the computational efficiency and scalability of our algorithm, and that only RENTT succeeds in uncovering ground truth explanations compared to conventional approximation methods like LIME and SHAP. All code is available at https://github.com/HelenaM23/RENTT .

Conclusion: TCNN通过激活操作、并行架构和信息融合层的优势，在保持低复杂度的同时实现了更出色的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: It is challenging to reduce the complexity of neural networks while maintaining their generalization ability and robustness, especially for practical applications. Conventional solutions for this problem incorporate quantum-inspired neural networks with Kronecker products and hybrid tensor neural networks with MPO factorization and fully-connected layers. Nonetheless, the generalization power and robustness of the fully-connected layers are not as outstanding as circuit models in quantum computing. In this paper, we propose a novel tensor circuit neural network (TCNN) that takes advantage of the characteristics of tensor neural networks and residual circuit models to achieve generalization ability and robustness with low complexity. The proposed activation operation and parallelism of the circuit in complex number field improves its non-linearity and efficiency for feature learning. Moreover, since the feature information exists in the parameters in both the real and imaginary parts in TCNN, an information fusion layer is proposed for merging features stored in those parameters to enhance the generalization capability. Experimental results confirm that TCNN showcases more outstanding generalization and robustness with its average accuracies on various datasets 2\%-3\% higher than those of the state-of-the-art compared models. More significantly, while other models fail to learn features under noise parameter attacking, TCNN still showcases prominent learning capability owing to its ability to prevent gradient explosion. Furthermore, it is comparable to the compared models on the number of trainable parameters and the CPU running time. An ablation study also indicates the advantage of the activation operation, the parallelism architecture and the information fusion layer.

Result: 实验验证MoC能显著节省内存并提高吞吐量，同时保持竞争力的模型性能。

Conclusion: MoC是一种有效的FFN架构，能解决LLM扩展中的激活内存瓶颈问题，在内存效率和模型性能之间取得良好平衡。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across diverse artificial intelligence tasks, driven by scaling laws that correlate model size and training data with performance improvements. However, this scaling paradigm incurs substantial memory overhead, creating significant challenges for both training and inference. While existing research has primarily addressed parameter and optimizer state memory reduction, activation memory-particularly from feed-forward networks (FFNs)-has become the critical bottleneck, especially when FlashAttention is implemented. In this work, we conduct a detailed memory profiling of LLMs and identify FFN activations as the predominant source to activation memory overhead. Motivated by this, we introduce Mixture-of-Channels (MoC), a novel FFN architecture that selectively activates only the Top-K most relevant channels per token determined by SwiGLU's native gating mechanism. MoC substantially reduces activation memory during pre-training and improves inference efficiency by reducing memory access through partial weight loading into GPU SRAM. Extensive experiments validate that MoC delivers significant memory savings and throughput gains while maintaining competitive model performance.

Conclusion: MARBLE模型有效处理非平稳环境，QWI算法在马尔可夫平均可索引性条件下能够收敛到最优解，为实际应用提供了理论保证。

Abstract: Restless Multi-Armed Bandits (RMABs) are powerful models for decision-making under uncertainty, yet classical formulations typically assume fixed dynamics, an assumption often violated in nonstationary environments. We introduce MARBLE (Multi-Armed Restless Bandits in a Latent Markovian Environment), which augments RMABs with a latent Markov state that induces nonstationary behavior. In MARBLE, each arm evolves according to a latent environment state that switches over time, making policy learning substantially more challenging. We further introduce the Markov-Averaged Indexability (MAI) criterion as a relaxed indexability assumption and prove that, despite unobserved regime switches, under the MAI criterion, synchronous Q-learning with Whittle Indices (QWI) converges almost surely to the optimal Q-function and the corresponding Whittle indices. We validate MARBLE on a calibrated simulator-embedded (digital twin) recommender system, where QWI consistently adapts to a shifting latent state and converges to an optimal policy, empirically corroborating our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated considerable potential for enhancing reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods suffer from Gradient Starvation and Policy Degradation when training directly on samples with mixed difficulty. To mitigate this, prior approaches leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data, but the construction of high-quality CoT annotations remains labor-intensive. Alternatively, curriculum learning strategies have been explored but frequently encounter challenges, such as difficulty mismatch, reliance on manual curriculum design, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose AdaCuRL, a Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates coarse-to-fine difficulty estimation with adaptive curriculum scheduling. This approach dynamically aligns data difficulty with model capability and incorporates a data revisitation mechanism to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, AdaCuRL employs adaptive reference and sparse KL strategies to prevent Policy Degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that AdaCuRL consistently achieves significant performance improvements on both LLMs and MLLMs.

Motivation: 随着复杂黑盒AI模型的普及，需要能够解释其决策的技术。特征归因方法已成为提供事后解释的流行解决方案，但该领域历史上缺乏正式的问题定义。

Method: 提出了DFAX（分布特征归因解释），这是一种新颖的模型无关特征归因方法，基于给定数据集表示的基础概率分布来支持解释。

Result: 通过大量实验证明，DFAX比最先进的基线方法更有效和高效。

Conclusion: DFAX是首个基于数据分布直接解释分类器预测的特征归因方法，克服了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: The proliferation of complex, black-box AI models has intensified the need for techniques that can explain their decisions. Feature attribution methods have become a popular solution for providing post-hoc explanations, yet the field has historically lacked a formal problem definition. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a formal definition for the problem of feature attribution, which stipulates that explanations be supported by an underlying probability distribution represented by the given dataset. Our analysis reveals that many existing model-agnostic methods fail to meet this criterion, while even those that do often possess other limitations. To overcome these challenges, we propose Distributional Feature Attribution eXplanations (DFAX), a novel, model-agnostic method for feature attribution. DFAX is the first feature attribution method to explain classifier predictions directly based on the data distribution. We show through extensive experiments that DFAX is more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WOODELF是一个新的SHAP算法，通过将决策树、博弈论和布尔逻辑整合到统一框架中，实现了线性时间计算Background SHAP值，在CPU和GPU上都有显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SHAP计算方法效率较低，特别是在处理大规模数据集时。需要一种更高效的计算方法来支持金融、广告、医疗等领域对模型解释性的实际需求。

Method: WOODELF为每个消费者构建伪布尔公式，捕捉特征值、决策树集成结构和整个背景数据集，然后利用这种表示在线性时间内计算Background SHAP值。

Result: 在包含300万行、500万背景样本和127个特征的数据集上，WOODELF在CPU上162秒、GPU上16秒完成所有Background Shapley值计算，相比最佳方法分别实现16倍和165倍加速。

Conclusion: WOODELF提供了一个高效、可扩展的SHAP计算框架，支持多种博弈论值的计算，能够满足实际应用中对大规模模型解释的需求。

Abstract: SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is a key tool for interpreting decision tree ensembles by assigning contribution values to features. It is widely used in finance, advertising, medicine, and other domains. Two main approaches to SHAP calculation exist: Path-Dependent SHAP, which leverages the tree structure for efficiency, and Background SHAP, which uses a background dataset to estimate feature distributions.
  We introduce WOODELF, a SHAP algorithm that integrates decision trees, game theory, and Boolean logic into a unified framework. For each consumer, WOODELF constructs a pseudo-Boolean formula that captures their feature values, the structure of the decision tree ensemble, and the entire background dataset. It then leverages this representation to compute Background SHAP in linear time. WOODELF can also compute Path-Dependent SHAP, Shapley interaction values, Banzhaf values, and Banzhaf interaction values.
  WOODELF is designed to run efficiently on CPU and GPU hardware alike. Available via the WOODELF Python package, it is implemented using NumPy, SciPy, and CuPy without relying on custom C++ or CUDA code. This design enables fast performance and seamless integration into existing frameworks, supporting large-scale computation of SHAP and other game-theoretic values in practice.
  For example, on a dataset with 3,000,000 rows, 5,000,000 background samples, and 127 features, WOODELF computed all Background Shapley values in 162 seconds on CPU and 16 seconds on GPU - compared to 44 minutes required by the best method on any hardware platform, representing 16x and 165x speedups, respectively.

TL;DR: 使用条件扩散模型插值稀疏采样的sinogram数据，以支持无约束探测器布局的PET成像，实现成本效益高且患者友好的新型PET几何结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PET成像需要完整的圆柱形探测器布局，限制了新型探测器设计的灵活性。无约束探测器布局（如步行式设计、长轴环）会产生严重欠采样的sinogram数据，需要有效的方法来恢复缺失信息。

Method: 提出将缺失的响应线视为可学习的先验，采用条件扩散模型来插值稀疏采样的sinogram数据。

Result: 该方法为新型PET几何结构提供了可行的数据恢复方案。

Conclusion: 条件扩散模型为支持无约束探测器布局的PET成像提供了有前景的解决方案，有望实现成本更低、患者体验更好的临床PET系统。

Abstract: Accurate PET imaging increasingly requires methods that support unconstrained detector layouts from walk-through designs to long-axial rings where gaps and open sides lead to severely undersampled sinograms. Instead of constraining the hardware to form complete cylinders, we propose treating the missing lines-of-responses as a learnable prior. Data-driven approaches, particularly generative models, offer a promising pathway to recover this missing information. In this work, we explore the use of conditional diffusion models to interpolate sparsely sampled sinograms, paving the way for novel, cost-efficient, and patient-friendly PET geometries in real clinical settings.

TL;DR: 提出CREAT方法进行配置文件污染攻击，通过约束强化学习平衡攻击效果和隐蔽性，实现针对性的序列推荐系统攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有配置文件污染攻击方法存在两个局限：过度依赖序列水平影响限制了细粒度项目转换扰动，整体修改导致可检测的分布偏移。

Method: 提出CREAT方法，结合双层优化框架和多奖励强化学习，开发模式平衡奖励策略和约束组相对强化学习范式。

Result: 广泛实验证明了CREAT的有效性。

Conclusion: CREAT方法能够实现针对性污染攻击，同时保持最小可检测性。

Abstract: Sequential Recommenders, which exploit dynamic user intents through interaction sequences, is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing attacks primarily rely on data poisoning, they require large-scale user access or fake profiles thus lacking practicality. In this paper, we focus on the Profile Pollution Attack that subtly contaminates partial user interactions to induce targeted mispredictions. Previous PPA methods suffer from two limitations, i.e., i) over-reliance on sequence horizon impact restricts fine-grained perturbations on item transitions, and ii) holistic modifications cause detectable distribution shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a constrained reinforcement driven attack CREAT that synergizes a bi-level optimization framework with multi-reward reinforcement learning to balance adversarial efficacy and stealthiness. We first develop a Pattern Balanced Rewarding Policy, which integrates pattern inversion rewards to invert critical patterns and distribution consistency rewards to minimize detectable shifts via unbalanced co-optimal transport. Then we employ a Constrained Group Relative Reinforcement Learning paradigm, enabling step-wise perturbations through dynamic barrier constraints and group-shared experience replay, achieving targeted pollution with minimal detectability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CREAT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练数据扰动（如对抗性数据投毒、机器学习遗忘、差分隐私）的影响研究相对不足，需要建立统一的认证框架来保证模型在这些情况下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AGT填补了训练数据扰动认证的研究空白，为对抗性数据投毒、机器学习遗忘和差分隐私等场景提供了形式化的鲁棒性保证。

Abstract: The impact of inference-time data perturbation (e.g., adversarial attacks) has been extensively studied in machine learning, leading to well-established certification techniques for adversarial robustness. In contrast, certifying models against training data perturbations remains a relatively under-explored area. These perturbations can arise in three critical contexts: adversarial data poisoning, where an adversary manipulates training samples to corrupt model performance; machine unlearning, which requires certifying model behavior under the removal of specific training data; and differential privacy, where guarantees must be given with respect to substituting individual data points. This work introduces Abstract Gradient Training (AGT), a unified framework for certifying robustness of a given model and training procedure to training data perturbations, including bounded perturbations, the removal of data points, and the addition of new samples. By bounding the reachable set of parameters, i.e., establishing provable parameter-space bounds, AGT provides a formal approach to analyzing the behavior of models trained via first-order optimization methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GDPR和CCPA等隐私法规要求完全遗忘未经授权的数据，但现有方法主要针对静态图设计，无法高效处理时空图中单个节点的全局信息扩散问题。

Method: 采用分治策略，包含两个新技术：增强子图构建（ESC）基于生物启发虚拟神经节自适应构建局部子图；全局神经节桥接（GGB）从局部子图重建全局时空依赖关系。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，CallosumNet仅产生1%-2%的相对MAE损失，显著优于现有最先进方法。消融研究验证了两种技术的有效性。

Conclusion: CallosumNet为时空图遗忘提供了一个高效解决方案，能够满足严格隐私法规要求，同时保持模型性能接近完整重训练的水平。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal graphs are widely used in modeling complex dynamic processes such as traffic forecasting, molecular dynamics, and healthcare monitoring. Recently, stringent privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA have introduced significant new challenges for existing spatio-temporal graph models, requiring complete unlearning of unauthorized data. Since each node in a spatio-temporal graph diffuses information globally across both spatial and temporal dimensions, existing unlearning methods primarily designed for static graphs and localized data removal cannot efficiently erase a single node without incurring costs nearly equivalent to full model retraining. Therefore, an effective approach for complete spatio-temporal graph unlearning is a pressing need. To address this, we propose CallosumNet, a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal graph unlearning framework inspired by the corpus callosum structure that facilitates communication between the brain's two hemispheres. CallosumNet incorporates two novel techniques: (1) Enhanced Subgraph Construction (ESC), which adaptively constructs multiple localized subgraphs based on several factors, including biologically-inspired virtual ganglions; and (2) Global Ganglion Bridging (GGB), which reconstructs global spatio-temporal dependencies from these localized subgraphs, effectively restoring the full graph representation. Empirical results on four diverse real-world datasets show that CallosumNet achieves complete unlearning with only 1%-2% relative MAE loss compared to the gold model, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of both proposed techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态工业物联网环境中模型需要选择性遗忘过时或错误知识的问题，避免现有方法依赖保留数据带来的计算负担和隐私合规冲突。

Method: PTE框架包含探测和编辑两个阶段：通过梯度上升探测决策边界邻域生成编辑指令，然后进行推-拉协同优化，推分支拆除目标类决策区域，拉分支通过掩码知识蒸馏锚定保留类知识。

Result: 在CWRU和SCUT-FD等多个通用和工业基准测试中，PTE在遗忘效果和模型效用之间取得了良好平衡。

Conclusion: PTE框架能够仅使用遗忘数据和原始模型实现高效平衡的知识编辑，解决了工业物联网环境中的选择性遗忘需求。

Abstract: In dynamic Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments, models need the ability to selectively forget outdated or erroneous knowledge. However, existing methods typically rely on retain data to constrain model behavior, which increases computational and energy burdens and conflicts with industrial data silos and privacy compliance requirements. To address this, we propose a novel retain-free unlearning framework, referred to as Probing then Editing (PTE). PTE frames unlearning as a probe-edit process: first, it probes the decision boundary neighborhood of the model on the to-be-forgotten class via gradient ascent and generates corresponding editing instructions using the model's own predictions. Subsequently, a push-pull collaborative optimization is performed: the push branch actively dismantles the decision region of the target class using the editing instructions, while the pull branch applies masked knowledge distillation to anchor the model's knowledge on retained classes to their original states. Benefiting from this mechanism, PTE achieves efficient and balanced knowledge editing using only the to-be-forgotten data and the original model. Experimental results demonstrate that PTE achieves an excellent balance between unlearning effectiveness and model utility across multiple general and industrial benchmarks such as CWRU and SCUT-FD.

TL;DR: TSGP使用预训练transformer模型作为变异算子，通过控制语义相似性生成子代程序，在符号回归问题上显著优于传统GP方法，并能通过目标语义距离平衡探索与利用。


<details>

Motivation: 传统语义遗传编程依赖固定语法变换，难以学习多样的结构变化。TSGP旨在利用transformer模型学习产生语义相似但结构多样的程序变体。

Method: 使用预训练transformer模型作为变异算子，通过控制目标语义距离SD_t来生成与父代语义相似的子代程序，实现语义空间中的可控搜索。

Result: 在24个真实世界和合成数据集上，TSGP显著优于标准GP、SLIM_GSGP、深度符号回归和去噪自编码器GP，平均排名1.58，且比SLIM_GSGP产生更紧凑的解。

Conclusion: TSGP证明了transformer模型在语义遗传编程中的有效性，目标语义距离SD_t提供了平衡探索与利用的有效机制，小值SD_t实现持续改进但程序较大，大值SD_t促进快速收敛和紧凑性。

Abstract: Transformer Semantic Genetic Programming (TSGP) is a semantic search approach that uses a pre-trained transformer model as a variation operator to generate offspring programs with controlled semantic similarity to a given parent. Unlike other semantic GP approaches that rely on fixed syntactic transformations, TSGP aims to learn diverse structural variations that lead to solutions with similar semantics. We find that a single transformer model trained on millions of programs is able to generalize across symbolic regression problems of varying dimension. Evaluated on 24 real-world and synthetic datasets, TSGP significantly outperforms standard GP, SLIM_GSGP, Deep Symbolic Regression, and Denoising Autoencoder GP, achieving an average rank of 1.58 across all benchmarks. Moreover, TSGP produces more compact solutions than SLIM_GSGP, despite its higher accuracy. In addition, the target semantic distance $\mathrm{SD}_t$ is able to control the step size in the semantic space: small values of $\mathrm{SD}_t$ enable consistent improvement in fitness but often lead to larger programs, while larger values promote faster convergence and compactness. Thus, $\mathrm{SD}_t$ provides an effective mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation.

Abstract: Theoretically exploring the advantages of neural networks might be one of the most challenging problems in the AI era. An adaptive feature program has recently been proposed to analyze the feature learning characteristic property of neural networks in a more abstract way. Motivated by the celebrated Le Cam equivalence, we advocate the over-parametrized sequence models to further simplify the analysis of the training dynamics of adaptive feature program and present several supporting evidences for the adaptive feature program. More precisely, after having introduced the feature error measure (FEM) to characterize the quality of the learned feature, we show that the FEM is decreasing during the training process of several concrete adaptive feature models including linear regression, single/multiple index models, etc. We believe that this hints at the potential successes of the adaptive feature program.

Conclusion: 将群对称性融入稀疏自编码器可以产生对下游任务更有用的特征，自适应等变SAE在具有对称性的数据上表现优越。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have proven useful in disentangling the opaque activations of neural networks, primarily large language models, into sets of interpretable features. However, adapting them to domains beyond language, such as scientific data with group symmetries, introduces challenges that can hinder their effectiveness. We show that incorporating such group symmetries into the SAEs yields features more useful in downstream tasks. More specifically, we train autoencoders on synthetic images and find that a single matrix can explain how their activations transform as the images are rotated. Building on this, we develop adaptively equivariant SAEs that can adapt to the base model's level of equivariance. These adaptive SAEs discover features that lead to superior probing performance compared to regular SAEs, demonstrating the value of incorporating symmetries in mechanistic interpretability tools.

Abstract: We propose a method that uses large language models to assist graph machine learning under personalization and privacy constraints. The approach combines data augmentation for sparse graphs, prompt and instruction tuning to adapt foundation models to graph tasks, and in-context learning to supply few-shot graph reasoning signals.

The method supports node classification and link prediction in low-resource settings and aligns language model latent representations with graph structure via a cross-modal regularizer. We outline a convergence argument for the variational aggregation procedure, describe a differential privacy threat model based on a moments accountant, and present applications to knowledge graph completion, recommendation-style link prediction, and citation and product graphs. We also discuss evaluation considerations for benchmarking LLM-assisted graph machine learning.

Abstract: With rapid urbanization in recent decades, traffic congestion has intensified due to increased movement of people and goods. As planning shifts from demand-based to supply-oriented strategies, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become essential for managing traffic within existing infrastructure. A core ITS function is traffic forecasting, enabling proactive measures like ramp metering, signal control, and dynamic routing through platforms such as Google Maps. This study assesses the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting traffic speed and flow using real-world data from California's Harbor Freeway, sourced from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Each model was evaluated over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20. The degradation in model performance was quantified using logarithmic transformation, with slope values used to measure robustness. Among DL models, Bi-LSTM had the flattest slope (0.0454 RMSE, 0.0545 MAE for flow), whereas ANFIS-GP had 0.1058 for RMSE and 0.1037 for flow MAE. The study concludes by identifying hybrid models as a promising future direction.

Conclusion: 该框架成功增强了SEP预测模型的透明度，为太阳物理学家提供了更深入的决策过程洞察，有助于理解事件背后的物理机制。

Abstract: Solar energetic particle (SEP) events, as one of the most prominent manifestations of solar activity, can generate severe hazardous radiation when accelerated by solar flares or shock waves formed aside from coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, most existing data-driven methods used for SEP predictions are operated as black-box models, making it challenging for solar physicists to interpret the results and understand the underlying physical causes of such events rather than just obtain a prediction. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates global explanations and ad-hoc feature mapping to enhance model transparency and provide deeper insights into the decision-making process. We validate our approach using a dataset of 341 SEP events, including 244 significant (>=10 MeV) proton events exceeding the Space Weather Prediction Center S1 threshold, spanning solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. Furthermore, we present an explainability-focused case study of major SEP events, demonstrating how our method improves explainability and facilitates a more physics-informed understanding of SEP event prediction.

Abstract: Planning in high-dimensional decision spaces is increasingly being studied through the lens of learned representations. Rather than training policies or value heads, we investigate whether planning can be carried out directly in an evaluation-aligned embedding space. We introduce SOLIS, which learns such a space using supervised contrastive learning. In this representation, outcome similarity is captured by proximity, and a single global advantage vector orients the space from losing to winning regions. Candidate actions are then ranked according to their alignment with this direction, reducing planning to vector operations in latent space. We demonstrate this approach in chess, where SOLIS uses only a shallow search guided by the learned embedding to reach competitive strength under constrained conditions. More broadly, our results suggest that evaluation-aligned latent planning offers a lightweight alternative to traditional dynamics models or policy learning.

Conclusion: 基于概率密度的核心集选择方法能够有效提升持续学习的性能，同时保持较高的计算效率，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Rehearsal-based Continual Learning (CL) maintains a limited memory buffer to store replay samples for knowledge retention, making these approaches heavily reliant on the quality of the stored samples. Current Rehearsal-based CL methods typically construct the memory buffer by selecting a representative subset (referred to as coresets), aiming to approximate the training efficacy of the full dataset with minimal storage overhead. However, mainstream Coreset Selection (CS) methods generally formulate the CS problem as a bi-level optimization problem that relies on numerous inner and outer iterations to solve, leading to substantial computational cost thus limiting their practical efficiency. In this paper, we aim to provide a more efficient selection logic and scheme for coreset construction. To this end, we first analyze the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the buffer-trained model and the Bayes-optimal model through the perspective of localized error decomposition to investigate the contribution of samples from different regions to MSE suppression. Further theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that samples with high probability density play a dominant role in error suppression. Inspired by this, we propose the Probability Density-Aware Coreset (PDAC) method. PDAC leverages the Projected Gaussian Mixture (PGM) model to estimate each sample's joint density, enabling efficient density-prioritized buffer selection. Finally, we introduce the streaming Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to enhance the adaptability of PGM parameters to streaming data, yielding Streaming PDAC (SPDAC) for streaming scenarios. Extensive comparative experiments show that our methods outperforms other baselines across various CL settings while ensuring favorable efficiency.

TL;DR: AutoSynth是一个无需参考数据集即可自动发现和优化合成数据生成工作流程的框架，通过蒙特卡洛树搜索和混合奖励机制解决冷启动问题，显著减少人工工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调LLM需要高质量数据集，但人工标注成本高昂。现有自动化方法存在冷启动问题，需要标注数据进行奖励建模，这在主观开放式任务中尤其困难。

Method: 将工作流程发现重新定义为蒙特卡洛树搜索问题，使用无数据集混合奖励指导搜索。该奖励包含两个LLM作为评判者组件：一个评估样本质量，另一个评估工作流程代码和提示质量。

Result: 在主观教育任务实验中，AutoSynth生成的数据训练出的模型显著优于基线（40-51% vs 2-5%），在某些指标上匹配甚至超越专家设计的工作流程，同时将人工工作量从5-7小时减少到30分钟（减少90%以上）。

Conclusion: AutoSynth解决了数据中心AI中的冷启动问题，为主观LLM任务提供了可扩展、经济高效的解决方案，能够发现超越人类直觉的质量维度。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models (LLMs) for specialized tasks requires high-quality datasets, but manual curation is prohibitively expensive. Synthetic data generation offers scalability, but its effectiveness relies on complex, multi-stage workflows, integrating prompt engineering and model orchestration. Existing automated workflow methods face a cold start problem: they require labeled datasets for reward modeling, which is especially problematic for subjective, open-ended tasks with no objective ground truth. We introduce AutoSynth, a framework that automates workflow discovery and optimization without reference datasets by reframing the problem as a Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a novel dataset-free hybrid reward. This reward enables meta-learning through two LLM-as-judge components: one evaluates sample quality using dynamically generated task-specific metrics, and another assesses workflow code and prompt quality. Experiments on subjective educational tasks show that while expert-designed workflows achieve higher human preference rates (96-99% win rates vs. AutoSynth's 40-51%), models trained on AutoSynth-generated data dramatically outperform baselines (40-51% vs. 2-5%) and match or surpass expert workflows on certain metrics, suggesting discovery of quality dimensions beyond human intuition. These results are achieved while reducing human effort from 5-7 hours to just 30 minutes (>90% reduction). AutoSynth tackles the cold start issue in data-centric AI, offering a scalable, cost-effective method for subjective LLM tasks. Code: https://github.com/bisz9918-maker/AutoSynth.

Motivation: 扩展经典确定性策略梯度方法，利用性能函数的二阶信息（Hessian矩阵）来改进收敛速度

Method: 基于兼容函数逼近概念，引入二次critic来同时保持真实策略梯度和性能Hessian近似，开发最小二乘时序差分学习方案估计参数，实现准牛顿actor更新

Result: 相比一阶方法获得更快的收敛速度，数值实验显示在标准确定性actor-critic基准上实现了改进的收敛和性能

Conclusion: 该二阶框架是通用的，适用于任何可微分策略类，能够有效利用曲率信息提升强化学习算法性能

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a second-order deterministic actor-critic framework in reinforcement learning that extends the classical deterministic policy gradient method to exploit curvature information of the performance function. Building on the concept of compatible function approximation for the critic, we introduce a quadratic critic that simultaneously preserves the true policy gradient and an approximation of the performance Hessian. A least-squares temporal difference learning scheme is then developed to estimate the quadratic critic parameters efficiently. This construction enables a quasi-Newton actor update using information learned by the critic, yielding faster convergence compared to first-order methods. The proposed approach is general and applicable to any differentiable policy class. Numerical examples demonstrate that the method achieves improved convergence and performance over standard deterministic actor-critic baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么关注特定基因变异对有限表型的影响，要么依赖人工整理的遗传信息，难以直接从基因序列广泛预测多种表型异常。

Method: 采用对比多标签学习目标捕捉表型间相关性，结合排他性正则化确保生物学一致性，并引入基因功能瓶颈层提供可解释的功能机制。

Result: 在四个数据集上实现了最先进的基因中心Fmax和表型中心AUC，案例研究展示了揭示基因功能机制的能力。

Conclusion: GenePheno为直接从基因序列预测多种表型异常提供了首个可解释的多标签预测框架，在可扩展性和泛化性方面具有优势。

Abstract: Exploring how genetic sequences shape phenotypes is a fundamental challenge in biology and a key step toward scalable, hypothesis-driven experimentation. The task is complicated by the large modality gap between sequences and phenotypes, as well as the pleiotropic nature of gene-phenotype relationships. Existing sequence-based efforts focus on the degree to which variants of specific genes alter a limited set of phenotypes, while general gene knockout induced phenotype abnormality prediction methods heavily rely on curated genetic information as inputs, which limits scalability and generalizability. As a result, the task of broadly predicting the presence of multiple phenotype abnormalities under gene knockout directly from gene sequences remains underexplored. We introduce GenePheno, the first interpretable multi-label prediction framework that predicts knockout induced phenotypic abnormalities from gene sequences. GenePheno employs a contrastive multi-label learning objective that captures inter-phenotype correlations, complemented by an exclusive regularization that enforces biological consistency. It further incorporates a gene function bottleneck layer, offering human interpretable concepts that reflect functional mechanisms behind phenotype formation. To support progress in this area, we curate four datasets with canonical gene sequences as input and multi-label phenotypic abnormalities induced by gene knockouts as targets. Across these datasets, GenePheno achieves state-of-the-art gene-centric Fmax and phenotype-centric AUC, and case studies demonstrate its ability to reveal gene functional mechanisms.

Motivation: 机器学习模型在推理过程中通常需要大量算术计算，这会增加延迟和功耗。为了解决这些问题，本文旨在开发更高效的推理架构。

Method: 采用数字时间域计算方法，包括延迟累积机制替代昂贵的类别算术和、胜者全得方案替代传统幅度比较器，以及针对多类TM的汉明距离驱动时间域方案和针对融合TM的差分延迟路径结合前导一检测对数延迟压缩方案。

Conclusion: 数字时间域计算方法为Tsetlin机器推理提供了一种高效的解决方案，显著降低了计算成本和功耗。

Abstract: Machine learning fits model parameters to approximate input-output mappings, predicting unknown samples. However, these models often require extensive arithmetic computations during inference, increasing latency and power consumption. This paper proposes a digital-time-domain computing approach for Tsetlin machine (TM) inference process to address these challenges. This approach leverages a delay accumulation mechanism to mitigate the costly arithmetic sums of classes and employs a Winner-Takes-All scheme to replace conventional magnitude comparators. Specifically, a Hamming distance-driven time-domain scheme is implemented for multi-class TMs. Furthermore, differential delay paths, combined with a leading-ones-detector logarithmic delay compression digital-time-domain scheme, are utilised for the coalesced TMs, accommodating both binary-signed and exponential-scale delay accumulation issues. Compared to the functionally equivalent, post-implementation digital TM architecture baseline, the proposed architecture demonstrates orders-of-magnitude improvements in energy efficiency and throughput.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算方法要么忽略结构上下文，要么依赖昂贵的内存密集型编码，限制了药物发现中的吞吐量和可扩展性。需要一种既能保持化学有效性又能与蛋白质结合口袋结构兼容的配体设计方法。

Method: 提出SiDGen框架，支持两种条件路径：简化模式从蛋白质嵌入中汇集粗粒度结构信号，完整模式注入局部成对偏置以实现更强耦合。采用粗步长折叠机制和最近邻上采样来缓解对张量的二次内存成本。

Result: 在自动化基准测试中，SiDGen生成的配体具有高有效性、独特性和新颖性，在基于对接的评估中达到竞争性性能，并保持合理的分子性质。

Conclusion: SiDGen能够提供可扩展的口袋感知分子设计，为高通量药物发现中的条件生成提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Designing ligands that are both chemically valid and structurally compatible with protein binding pockets is a key bottleneck in computational drug discovery. Existing approaches either ignore structural context or rely on expensive, memory-intensive encoding that limits throughput and scalability. We present SiDGen (Structure-informed Diffusion Generator), a protein-conditioned diffusion framework that integrates masked SMILES generation with lightweight folding-derived features for pocket awareness. To balance expressivity with efficiency, SiDGen supports two conditioning pathways: a streamlined mode that pools coarse structural signals from protein embeddings and a full mode that injects localized pairwise biases for stronger coupling. A coarse-stride folding mechanism with nearest-neighbor upsampling alleviates the quadratic memory costs of pair tensors, enabling training on realistic sequence lengths. Learning stability is maintained through in-loop chemical validity checks and an invalidity penalty, while large-scale training efficiency is restored \textit{via} selective compilation, dataloader tuning, and gradient accumulation. In automated benchmarks, SiDGen generates ligands with high validity, uniqueness, and novelty, while achieving competitive performance in docking-based evaluations and maintaining reasonable molecular properties. These results demonstrate that SiDGen can deliver scalable, pocket-aware molecular design, providing a practical route to conditional generation for high-throughput drug discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在有限平行语料库情况下机器翻译模型的训练问题，通过明确惩罚语言无效输出来提高模型性能和数据效率。

Method: 将语言约束编码为严重性加权的惩罚项加入损失函数，生成目标语言语法违规的合成数据，在训练中明确惩罚模型对语言无效输出的高概率分配。

Result: 在所有架构上都实现了改进：性能良好模型获得3-12% BLEU提升，缺乏足够初始支持的模型获得56-89%提升；提供5倍数据效率提升，使用1,000个样本训练可达到或超过使用5,000个样本的正常训练效果。

Conclusion: NSL-MT为平行语料库有限的情况提供了一种数据高效的替代训练方法。

Abstract: We introduce Negative Space Learning MT (NSL-MT), a training method that teaches models what not to generate by encoding linguistic constraints as severity-weighted penalties in the loss function. NSL-MT increases limited parallel data with synthetically generated violations of target language grammar, explicitly penalizing the model when it assigns high probability to these linguistically invalid outputs. We demonstrate that NSL-MT delivers improvements across all architectures: 3-12\% BLEU gains for well-performing models and 56-89\% gains for models lacking descent initial support. Furthermore, NSL-MT provides a 5x data efficiency multiplier -- training with 1,000 examples matches or exceeds normal training with 5,000 examples. Thus, NSL-MT provides a data-efficient alternative training method for settings where there is limited annotated parallel corporas.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用LLM和抽象意义表示(AMR)图将无约束英语翻译成ASP程序的新方法，用于解决逻辑谜题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASP是一种强大的组合问题求解工具，但需要学习语法。随着非编程人员需要与代码交互的需求增加，需要一种将自然语言转换为ASP程序的方法。

Method: 使用LLM简化自然语言句子、识别关键词和生成简单事实，然后从简化语言解析AMR图，系统化生成ASP约束。

Result: 系统成功创建了完整的ASP程序来解决组合逻辑问题，相比完全依赖LLM的方法，最小化了LLM的作用。

Conclusion: 这是创建轻量级、可解释的自然语言到复杂逻辑问题求解系统的重大第一步。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a declarative programming paradigm based on logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning. It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts. The AMR graphs are then parsed from simplified language and used to generate ASP constraints systematically. The system successfully creates an entire ASP program that solves a combinatorial logic problem. This approach is a significant first step in creating a lighter-weight, explainable system that converts natural language to solve complex logic problems.

Conclusion: 这是首个将VSA应用于ARC-AGI的方法，开发了迄今为止最认知合理的ARC-AGI求解器，在保持高效的同时实现了可解释性。

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) is a generative, few-shot fluid intelligence benchmark. Although humans effortlessly solve ARC-AGI, it remains extremely difficult for even the most advanced artificial intelligence systems. Inspired by methods for modelling human intelligence spanning neuroscience to psychology, we propose a cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver. Our solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning in an efficient and interpretable process using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). Our solver works by object-centric program synthesis, leveraging VSAs to represent abstract objects, guide solution search, and enable sample-efficient neural learning. Preliminary results indicate success, with our solver scoring 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval. Additionally, our solver performs well on simpler benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC -- the latter outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. Importantly, our approach is unique; we believe we are the first to apply VSAs to ARC-AGI and have developed the most cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver yet.

Motivation: 挑战传统强化学习单一最大化奖励的范式，探索将RL系统构建为能够回答环境多样性查询的推理引擎，充分利用训练后智能体隐含的环境知识。

Method: 引入查询条件确定性推理网络(QDIN)，为不同类型的查询设计专门的神经模块，将查询作为一等公民处理，优化每种推理模式。

Result: 推理准确性可达近乎完美水平（99%可达性IoU），而控制性能仍保持次优（31%回报），表明世界知识表示与控制所需表示存在根本性解耦；查询专门化架构优于统一模型和后验提取方法。

Conclusion: 为从设计之初就将RL系统构建为可查询知识库的研究议程奠定基础，对可解释性、验证和人机协作具有重要意义。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has traditionally focused on a singular objective: learning policies that select actions to maximize reward. We challenge this paradigm by asking: what if we explicitly architected RL systems as inference engines that can answer diverse queries about their environment? In deterministic settings, trained agents implicitly encode rich knowledge about reachability, distances, values, and dynamics - yet current architectures are not designed to expose this information efficiently. We introduce Query Conditioned Deterministic Inference Networks (QDIN), a unified architecture that treats different types of queries (policy, reachability, paths, comparisons) as first-class citizens, with specialized neural modules optimized for each inference pattern. Our key empirical finding reveals a fundamental decoupling: inference accuracy can reach near-perfect levels (99% reachability IoU) even when control performance remains suboptimal (31% return), suggesting that the representations needed for accurate world knowledge differ from those required for optimal control. Experiments demonstrate that query specialized architectures outperform both unified models and post-hoc extraction methods, while maintaining competitive control performance. This work establishes a research agenda for RL systems designed from inception as queryable knowledge bases, with implications for interpretability, verification, and human-AI collaboration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统POMDP求解器使用α向量表示价值函数，每个α向量是|S|维的，在大规模问题中Bellman备份的计算成本变得不可行。需要一种更高效的方法来处理大规模POMDP。

Method: 利用POMDP价值函数的PWLC特性，提出用有限个神经网络来替代α向量表示价值函数。结合神经网络的泛化能力和经典价值迭代框架，开发了神经价值迭代算法。

Result: 该方法在现有离线求解器无法处理的大规模POMDP中仍能获得接近最优的解。

Conclusion: 神经网络表示为POMDP规划提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，能够有效处理传统方法难以应对的大规模问题。

Abstract: The value function of a POMDP exhibits the piecewise-linear-convex (PWLC) property and can be represented as a finite set of hyperplanes, known as $α$-vectors. Most state-of-the-art POMDP solvers (offline planners) follow the point-based value iteration scheme, which performs Bellman backups on $α$-vectors at reachable belief points until convergence. However, since each $α$-vector is $|S|$-dimensional, these methods quickly become intractable for large-scale problems due to the prohibitive computational cost of Bellman backups. In this work, we demonstrate that the PWLC property allows a POMDP's value function to be alternatively represented as a finite set of neural networks. This insight enables a novel POMDP planning algorithm called \emph{Neural Value Iteration}, which combines the generalization capability of neural networks with the classical value iteration framework. Our approach achieves near-optimal solutions even in extremely large POMDPs that are intractable for existing offline solvers.

Motivation: 当前LLM作为智能导师的方法缺乏动态适应能力，无法区分学生是否真正理解或只是重复答案，也不能实时感知学生认知状态变化。

Method: 提出单向认知优化(UCO)方法，采用多轮交互强化学习范式，包含两个协同奖励函数：进度奖励评估学生从困惑到理解的认知进步，支架奖励动态识别学生的最近发展区。

Conclusion: UCO方法有效解决了LLM作为智能导师的动态适应问题，通过认知状态感知和最近发展区识别实现了更有效的教学策略调整。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are shifting from answer providers to intelligent tutors in educational settings, yet current supervised fine-tuning methods only learn surface teaching patterns without dynamic adaptation capabilities. Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone. We evaluate UCO by comparing it against 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our UCO model outperforms all models of equivalent scale and achieves performance comparable to advanced closed-source models. The code and data are available at https://github.com/Mind-Lab-ECNU/UCO.

Conclusion: Lumine在不同世界和交互动态中表现出色，标志着在开放环境中开发通用智能体方面迈出了具体一步。

Abstract: We introduce Lumine, the first open recipe for developing generalist agents capable of completing hours-long complex missions in real time within challenging 3D open-world environments. Lumine adopts a human-like interaction paradigm that unifies perception, reasoning, and action in an end-to-end manner, powered by a vision-language model. It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary. Trained in Genshin Impact, Lumine successfully completes the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline on par with human-level efficiency and follows natural language instructions to perform a broad spectrum of tasks in both 3D open-world exploration and 2D GUI manipulation across collection, combat, puzzle-solving, and NPC interaction. In addition to its in-domain performance, Lumine demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-game generalization. Without any fine-tuning, it accomplishes 100-minute missions in Wuthering Waves and the full five-hour first chapter of Honkai: Star Rail. These promising results highlight Lumine's effectiveness across distinct worlds and interaction dynamics, marking a concrete step toward generalist agents in open-ended environments.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了生物声学AI系统与其他物种递归交流过程相遇时产生的双重偶然性问题，主张从通用模式识别转向不同递归认知形式之间的外交性相遇。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生物声学AI系统虽然取得了跨物种的优异表现，但忽视了AI系统自身递归认知与其他物种递归交流过程相遇时的根本问题。AI系统不是中立的模式检测器，而是可能系统性模糊或扭曲其他物种交流结构的递归认知主体。

Method: 基于哲学家Yuk Hui关于递归性和偶然性的研究，分析AI系统与其他物种交流相遇时的双重偶然性问题——每个物种的交流都源于偶然的生态和进化条件，而AI系统则通过自身偶然的架构和训练条件处理这些信号。

Result: 识别出AI系统作为递归认知主体可能系统性遮蔽或扭曲其他物种交流结构的问题，提出了双重偶然性挑战。

Conclusion: 解决这一挑战需要将生物声学AI重新概念化，从通用模式识别转向不同递归认知形式之间的外交性相遇，这对模型设计、评估框架和研究方法都有重要影响。

Abstract: Current bioacoustic AI systems achieve impressive cross-species performance by processing animal communication through transformer architectures, foundation model paradigms, and other computational approaches. However, these approaches overlook a fundamental question: what happens when one form of recursive cognition--AI systems with their attention mechanisms, iterative processing, and feedback loops--encounters the recursive communicative processes of other species? Drawing on philosopher Yuk Hui's work on recursivity and contingency, I argue that AI systems are not neutral pattern detectors but recursive cognitive agents whose own information processing may systematically obscure or distort other species' communicative structures. This creates a double contingency problem: each species' communication emerges through contingent ecological and evolutionary conditions, while AI systems process these signals through their own contingent architectural and training conditions. I propose that addressing this challenge requires reconceptualizing bioacoustic AI from universal pattern recognition toward diplomatic encounter between different forms of recursive cognition, with implications for model design, evaluation frameworks, and research methodologies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AlphaCast是一个结合人类智慧与大型语言模型智能的协同推理框架，将时间序列预测重新定义为交互式过程，通过自动化预测准备和生成推理优化两阶段实现更准确的预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列预测方法大多将其视为静态的一次性映射任务，缺乏人类专家的交互、推理和适应性，限制了在复杂现实环境中的实用性。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1) 自动化预测准备阶段构建多源认知基础；2) 生成推理和反思优化阶段整合统计特征、先验知识、上下文信息和预测策略，触发元推理循环进行持续自校正。

Result: 在短期和长期数据集上的广泛实验表明，AlphaCast在预测准确性方面始终优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: AlphaCast通过人类智慧与LLM智能的协同推理，显著提升了时间序列预测的准确性和实用性，为复杂环境下的预测任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in high-stakes domains such as energy, healthcare, and climate. Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.

*Preesha Gehlot,Anna Rapberger,Fabrizio Russo,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了首个基于图神经网络(GNN)的方法来近似计算基于假设的论证(ABA)框架中的可信接受性，通过依赖图表示和两种GNN架构在ICCMA基准上取得了优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ABA是一种强大的结构化论证形式，但在稳定语义下精确计算扩展对于大型框架是难处理的，需要可扩展的近似推理方法。

Method: 将ABA框架建模为依赖图，编码假设、声明和规则作为节点，使用异构边标签区分支持、推导和攻击关系。提出了ABAGCN和ABAGAT两种GNN架构，分别堆叠残差异构卷积层或注意力层来学习节点嵌入。

Result: ABAGCN和ABAGAT在ICCMA基准上优于从抽象论证文献改编的最先进GNN基线，节点级F1得分高达0.71。提出的扩展重构算法在小ABAF上F1超过0.85，在大型框架上保持约0.58的F1。

Conclusion: 这项工作为结构化论证中的可扩展近似推理开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA) is a powerful structured argumentation formalism, but exact computation of extensions under stable semantics is intractable for large frameworks. We present the first Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to approximate credulous acceptance in ABA. To leverage GNNs, we model ABA frameworks via a dependency graph representation encoding assumptions, claims and rules as nodes, with heterogeneous edge labels distinguishing support, derive and attack relations. We propose two GNN architectures - ABAGCN and ABAGAT - that stack residual heterogeneous convolution or attention layers, respectively, to learn node embeddings. Our models are trained on the ICCMA 2023 benchmark, augmented with synthetic ABAFs, with hyperparameters optimised via Bayesian search. Empirically, both ABAGCN and ABAGAT outperform a state-of-the-art GNN baseline that we adapt from the abstract argumentation literature, achieving a node-level F1 score of up to 0.71 on the ICCMA instances. Finally, we develop a sound polynomial time extension-reconstruction algorithm driven by our predictor: it reconstructs stable extensions with F1 above 0.85 on small ABAFs and maintains an F1 of about 0.58 on large frameworks. Our work opens new avenues for scalable approximate reasoning in structured argumentation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型表现出卓越的流畅性，但研究者仍在努力提升其推理能力。本文基于搜索导向的LLM计算解释，旨在开发系统化框架来理解和优化LLM推理。

Method: 采用递归精炼方法，包括自我批评、对抗性压力测试和整合关键反馈的迭代过程。设计实验比较简单线性管道与包含递归精炼层的复杂结构化管道，使用基于RAG的美国开国元勋历史人物模型，对三个当代政治问题生成回答。

Result: 复杂模型在所有九个测试案例中均优于简单模型，平均仲裁分数为88.3对71.7。复杂模型的论证在分析深度、结构细微差别和战略框架方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 递归精炼是通过GIS搜索增强LLM推理能力的强大架构特征。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional fluency, efforts persist to extract stronger reasoning capabilities from them. Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. We conclude that recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via GIS search.

Conclusion: 与其依赖持续改进当前LLMs，大规模分解的代理过程可能为组织和社会层面的问题提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: LLMs have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in reasoning, insights, and tool use, but chaining these abilities into extended processes at the scale of those routinely executed by humans, organizations, and societies has remained out of reach. The models have a persistent error rate that prevents scale-up: for instance, recent experiments in the Towers of Hanoi benchmark domain showed that the process inevitably becomes derailed after at most a few hundred steps. Thus, although LLM research is often still benchmarked on tasks with relatively few dependent logical steps, there is increasing attention on the ability (or inability) of LLMs to perform long range tasks. This paper describes MAKER, the first system that successfully solves a task with over one million LLM steps with zero errors, and, in principle, scales far beyond this level. The approach relies on an extreme decomposition of a task into subtasks, each of which can be tackled by focused microagents. The high level of modularity resulting from the decomposition allows error correction to be applied at each step through an efficient multi-agent voting scheme. This combination of extreme decomposition and error correction makes scaling possible. Thus, the results suggest that instead of relying on continual improvement of current LLMs, massively decomposed agentic processes (MDAPs) may provide a way to efficiently solve problems at the level of organizations and societies.

Conclusion: Argus能有效高效地增强ADS的韧性，显著提升驾驶性能并预防安全违规

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems (ADSs), with their strong capabilities in environmental perception and generalizable driving decisions, are attracting growing attention from both academia and industry. However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.
  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are poised to revolutionize emergency services by enabling faster, safer, and more efficient responses. This transformation is driven by advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL), which allows AVs to navigate complex environments and make critical decisions in real time. However, conventional RL paradigms often suffer from poor sample efficiency and lack adaptability in dynamic emergency scenarios. This paper reviews next-generation AV optimization strategies to address these limitations. We analyze the shift from conventional RL to Diffusion Model (DM)-augmented RL, which enhances policy robustness through synthetic data generation, albeit with increased computational cost. Additionally, we explore the emerging paradigm of Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted In-Context Learning (ICL), which offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative by enabling rapid, on-the-fly adaptation without retraining. By reviewing the state of the art in AV intelligence, DM-augmented RL, and LLM-assisted ICL, this paper provides a critical framework for understanding the next generation of autonomous emergency response systems from a Generative AI perspective.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OR-R1是一个数据高效的训练框架，用于自动化优化建模和求解，通过两阶段训练（SFT+TGRPO）在少量标注数据下实现最先进性能，解决准确率达67.7%，仅需先前方法1/10的数据量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的优化建模方法需要大量标注或合成数据，导致成本高且可扩展性差，需要开发数据效率更高的自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：首先通过监督微调(SFT)从有限标注数据学习问题建模和代码生成模式，然后通过测试时组相对策略优化(TGRPO)提升能力和一致性，充分利用稀缺标注数据和丰富未标注数据。

Result: OR-R1平均求解准确率达67.7%，仅需ORLM方法1/10的数据量，准确率提升达4.2%；在仅100个合成样本下仍优于ORLM 2.4%；TGRPO带来额外3.1%-6.4%准确率提升，将单次与多次尝试性能差距从13%缩小到7%。

Conclusion: OR-R1为自动化运筹优化问题建模和求解提供了稳健、可扩展且成本效益高的解决方案，显著降低了工业应用的专家知识和数据门槛。

Abstract: Optimization modeling and solving are fundamental to the application of Operations Research (OR) in real-world decision making, yet the process of translating natural language problem descriptions into formal models and solver code remains highly expertise intensive. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for automation, the generalization ability and data efficiency of existing LLM-based methods are still limited, asmost require vast amounts of annotated or synthetic data, resulting in high costs and scalability barriers. In this work, we present OR-R1, a data-efficient training framework for automated optimization modeling and solving. OR-R1 first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to help the model acquire the essential reasoning patterns for problem formulation and code generation from limited labeled data. In addition, it improves the capability and consistency through Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO). This two-stage design enables OR-R1 to leverage both scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data for effective learning. Experiments show that OR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average solving accuracy of $67.7\%$, using only $1/10$ the synthetic data required by prior methods such as ORLM, exceeding ORLM's solving accuracy by up to $4.2\%$. Remarkably, OR-R1 outperforms ORLM by over $2.4\%$ with just $100$ synthetic samples. Furthermore, TGRPO contributes an additional $3.1\%-6.4\%$ improvement in accuracy, significantly narrowing the gap between single-attempt (Pass@1) and multi-attempt (Pass@8) performance from $13\%$ to $7\%$. Extensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that OR-R1 provides a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for automated OR optimization problem modeling and solving, lowering the expertise and data barriers for industrial OR applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理在长时程任务中表现出弱短期记忆，将链式交互视为离散的屏幕理解，缺乏对历史交互的感知，这限制了GUI自动化的性能。

Method: 提出HAR框架，包括构建反思学习场景、合成定制修正指南和设计混合RL奖励函数，开发了端到端模型HAR-GUI-3B。

Result: 在多个GUI相关基准测试上的综合评估证明了该方法的有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: HAR框架成功将GUI代理的推理模式从历史无关转变为历史感知，使其具备稳定的短期记忆和可靠的屏幕细节感知能力。

Abstract: Advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have significantly enhanced Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation. Equipping GUI agents with reliable episodic reasoning capabilities is essential for bridging the gap between users' concise task descriptions and the complexities of real-world execution. Current methods integrate Reinforcement Learning (RL) with System-2 Chain-of-Thought, yielding notable gains in reasoning enhancement. For long-horizon GUI tasks, historical interactions connect each screen to the goal-oriented episode chain, and effectively leveraging these clues is crucial for the current decision. However, existing native GUI agents exhibit weak short-term memory in their explicit reasoning, interpreting the chained interactions as discrete screen understanding, i.e., unawareness of the historical interactions within the episode. This history-agnostic reasoning challenges their performance in GUI automation. To alleviate this weakness, we propose a History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework, which encourages an agent to reflect on its own errors and acquire episodic reasoning knowledge from them via tailored strategies that enhance short-term memory in long-horizon interaction. The framework mainly comprises constructing a reflective learning scenario, synthesizing tailored correction guidelines, and designing a hybrid RL reward function. Using the HAR framework, we develop a native end-to-end model, HAR-GUI-3B, which alters the inherent reasoning mode from history-agnostic to history-aware, equipping the GUI agent with stable short-term memory and reliable perception of screen details. Comprehensive evaluations across a range of GUI-related benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method.

Conclusion: 错误分析揭示了几个普遍问题，为未来改进指明了具体方向，过程评估对于GUI代理的全面评估至关重要。

Abstract: With the deep integration of artificial intelligence and interactive technology, Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agent, as the carrier connecting goal-oriented natural language and real-world devices, has received widespread attention from the community. Contemporary benchmarks aim to evaluate the comprehensive capabilities of GUI agents in GUI operation tasks, generally determining task completion solely by inspecting the final screen state. However, GUI operation tasks consist of multiple chained steps while not all critical information is presented in the final few pages. Although a few research has begun to incorporate intermediate steps into evaluation, accurately and automatically capturing this process information still remains an open challenge. To address this weakness, we introduce ProBench, a comprehensive mobile benchmark with over 200 challenging GUI tasks covering widely-used scenarios. Remaining the traditional State-related Task evaluation, we extend our dataset to include Process-related Task and design a specialized evaluation method. A newly introduced Process Provider automatically supplies accurate process information, enabling presice assessment of agent's performance. Our evaluation of advanced GUI agents reveals significant limitations for real-world GUI scenarios. These shortcomings are prevalent across diverse models, including both large-scale generalist models and smaller, GUI-specific models. A detailed error analysis further exposes several universal problems, outlining concrete directions for future improvements.

Method: 提出训练简洁性奖励模型(CRM)的管道，设计新颖的简洁性奖励函数(CRF)，在结果奖励和简洁性评分之间建立显式依赖关系。

Conclusion: 该方法从理论上证明了新奖励在方差减少和改进收敛性方面的优越性，在实践中有效解决了过度思考问题，实现了更高效和有效的推理。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling the development of large reasoning models (LRMs). However, LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 often generate verbose responses containing redundant or irrelevant reasoning step-a phenomenon known as overthinking-which substantially increases computational costs. Prior efforts to mitigate this issue commonly incorporate length penalties into the reward function, but we find they frequently suffer from two critical issues: length collapse and training collapse, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address them, we propose a pipeline for training a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores the conciseness of reasoning path. Additionally, we introduce a novel reward formulation named Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) with explicit dependency between the outcome reward and conciseness score, thereby fostering both more effective and more efficient reasoning. From a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate the superiority of the new reward from the perspective of variance reduction and improved convergence properties. Besides, on the practical side, extensive experiments on five mathematical benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and token efficiency, which achieves an 8.1% accuracy improvement and a 19.9% reduction in response token length on Qwen2.5-7B. Furthermore, the method generalizes well to other LLMs including Llama and Mistral. The implementation code and datasets are publicly available for reproduction: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CRM.

Result: 该框架为人类操作员提供了决策支持，帮助他们判断输出是否可能不可靠并进行干预。

Conclusion: 该框架为开发缓解技术提供了基础，以减少运行期间不确定可靠性带来的风险。

Abstract: The implementation of agentic AI systems has the potential of providing more helpful AI systems in a variety of applications. These systems work autonomously towards a defined goal with reduced external control. Despite their potential, one of their flaws is the insufficient reliability which makes them especially unsuitable for high-risk domains such as healthcare or process industry. Unreliable systems pose a risk in terms of unexpected behavior during operation and mitigation techniques are needed. In this work, we derive the main reliability challenges of agentic AI systems during operation based on their characteristics. We draw the connection to traditional AI systems and formulate a fundamental reliability challenge during operation which is inherent to traditional and agentic AI systems. As our main contribution, we propose a two-layered reliability monitoring framework for agentic AI systems which consists of a out-of-distribution detection layer for novel inputs and AI transparency layer to reveal internal operations. This two-layered monitoring approach gives a human operator the decision support which is needed to decide whether an output is potential unreliable or not and intervene. This framework provides a foundation for developing mitigation techniques to reduce risk stemming from uncertain reliability during operation.

TL;DR: MedFuse是一个用于不规则临床时间序列的框架，通过乘法融合模块(MuFuse)将特征值和特征标识嵌入进行乘法调制，在保留特征特定信息的同时建模跨特征的高阶依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录(EHR)中的临床时间序列具有不规则性、异步采样、缺失值和异质特征动态等特点。现有嵌入策略通常通过加法操作结合特征标识和值嵌入，限制了捕捉值依赖特征交互的能力。

Method: 提出MedFuse框架，核心是MuFuse模块，通过乘法调制融合值和特征嵌入，保留特征特定信息并建模跨特征的高阶依赖关系。

Result: 在三个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，MedFuse在关键预测任务上持续优于最先进的基线方法。学习表示的分析进一步证明乘法融合增强了表达能力并支持跨数据集预训练。

Conclusion: MedFuse为建模不规则临床时间序列提供了一个可泛化的方法。

Abstract: Clinical time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs) are inherently irregular, with asynchronous sampling, missing values, and heterogeneous feature dynamics. While numerical laboratory measurements are highly informative, existing embedding strategies usually combine feature identity and value embeddings through additive operations, which constrains their ability to capture value-dependent feature interactions. We propose MedFuse, a framework for irregular clinical time series centered on the MuFuse (Multiplicative Embedding Fusion) module. MuFuse fuses value and feature embeddings through multiplicative modulation, preserving feature-specific information while modeling higher-order dependencies across features. Experiments on three real-world datasets covering both intensive and chronic care show that MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on key predictive tasks. Analysis of the learned representations further demonstrates that multiplicative fusion enhances expressiveness and supports cross-dataset pretraining. These results establish MedFuse as a generalizable approach for modeling irregular clinical time series.

Conclusion: HyperD通过解耦周期性模式和残差波动有效解决了交通预测的关键挑战，为智能交通系统提供了可靠解决方案

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems, enabling applications such as congestion control, route planning, and urban mobility optimization.However, traffic forecasting remains challenging due to two key factors: (1) complex spatial dependencies arising from dynamic interactions between road segments and traffic sensors across the network, and (2) the coexistence of multi-scale periodic patterns (e.g., daily and weekly periodic patterns driven by human routines) with irregular fluctuations caused by unpredictable events (e.g., accidents, weather, or construction). To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that HyperD achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, while offering superior robustness under disturbances and improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出从"模型训练"转向"模型培养"的新范式，将价值观对齐融入模型开发全过程，通过重构训练语料库实现从第一个训练token开始的价值观承诺


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI训练方法只在模型核心能力建立后才进行价值观对齐，导致模型容易被误导且缺乏深层价值体系。在LLM能力开始超越人类的背景下，需要从根本上改变训练方式

Method: 重新设计训练语料库：采用第一人称视角重构训练数据、将信息重新情境化为生活经验、模拟社会互动、对训练数据进行支架式排序

Result: 预期这种训练语料库重构将实现从第一个训练token开始的早期价值观承诺，使知识、技能和价值观内在紧密结合

Conclusion: 在大型语言模型能力开始超越人类能力的生态系统中，这种从训练转向培养的范式转变至关重要

Abstract: Current AI training methods align models with human values only after their core capabilities have been established, resulting in models that are easily misaligned and lack deep-rooted value systems. We propose a paradigm shift from "model training" to "model raising", in which alignment is woven into a model's development from the start. We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate. In an ecosystem in which large language model capabilities start overtaking human capabilities in many tasks, this seems to us like a critical need.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI主要推动了定量方法的发展，而定性研究这一对意义建构和全面科学理解至关重要的维度却被忽视。定性研究者对采用AI持犹豫态度，即使愿意使用，也只能依赖有诸多局限的通用工具如ChatGPT。

Method: 通过回顾近期文献，分析现有自动化发现流程如何通过增强定性能力来改进，并识别安全定性AI在多学科和混合方法研究中的关键机会。

Result: 研究发现需要开发从零开始构建的、专门用于解释性研究的定性AI系统，这些系统必须具有透明性、可复现性和隐私友好性。

Conclusion: 开发专门的定性AI系统对于弥合AI在定量和定性方法之间的差距至关重要，能够推动多学科和混合方法研究的进步。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLM) are reshaping science, with most recent advances culminating in fully-automated scientific discovery pipelines. But qualitative research has been left behind. Researchers in qualitative methods are hesitant about AI adoption. Yet when they are willing to use AI at all, they have little choice but to rely on general-purpose tools like ChatGPT to assist with interview interpretation, data annotation, and topic modeling - while simultaneously acknowledging these system's well-known limitations of being biased, opaque, irreproducible, and privacy-compromising. This creates a critical gap: while AI has substantially advanced quantitative methods, the qualitative dimensions essential for meaning-making and comprehensive scientific understanding remain poorly integrated. We argue for developing dedicated qualitative AI systems built from the ground up for interpretive research. Such systems must be transparent, reproducible, and privacy-friendly. We review recent literature to show how existing automated discovery pipelines could be enhanced by robust qualitative capabilities, and identify key opportunities where safe qualitative AI could advance multidisciplinary and mixed-methods research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM的智能体框架，用于自动合成屏障证书，通过自然语言推理来提议、优化和验证候选证书，结合LLM驱动的模板发现和SMT验证，支持屏障-控制器协同合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统屏障证书合成方法存在可扩展性差、依赖精心设计的模板、需要大量手动专业知识等问题，希望通过语言模型捕捉和操作化专家推理。

Method: 使用LLM智能体框架进行自然语言推理，结合模板发现和SMT验证，支持屏障-控制器协同合成，并引入检索增强生成和智能体协调策略。

Result: 在包含100个动态系统的BarrierBench基准测试中，框架在生成有效证书方面达到超过90%的成功率。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了语言模型在形式验证中的潜力，通过发布BarrierBench基准和工具链，为语言推理与形式验证的集成建立了社区测试平台。

Abstract: Safety verification of dynamical systems via barrier certificates is essential for ensuring correctness in autonomous applications. Synthesizing these certificates involves discovering mathematical functions with current methods suffering from poor scalability, dependence on carefully designed templates, and exhaustive or incremental function-space searches. They also demand substantial manual expertise--selecting templates, solvers, and hyperparameters, and designing sampling strategies--requiring both theoretical and practical knowledge traditionally shared through linguistic reasoning rather than formalized methods.
  This motivates a key question: can such expert reasoning be captured and operationalized by language models? We address this by introducing an LLM-based agentic framework for barrier certificate synthesis. The framework uses natural language reasoning to propose, refine, and validate candidate certificates, integrating LLM-driven template discovery with SMT-based verification, and supporting barrier-controller co-synthesis to ensure consistency between safety certificates and controllers.
  To evaluate this capability, we introduce BarrierBench, a benchmark of 100 dynamical systems spanning linear, nonlinear, discrete-time, and continuous-time settings. Our experiments assess not only the effectiveness of LLM-guided barrier synthesis but also the utility of retrieval-augmented generation and agentic coordination strategies in improving its reliability and performance. Across these tasks, the framework achieves more than 90% success in generating valid certificates. By releasing BarrierBench and the accompanying toolchain, we aim to establish a community testbed for advancing the integration of language-based reasoning with formal verification in dynamical systems.
  The benchmark is publicly available at https://hycodev.com/dataset/barrierbench

TL;DR: 评估2025年三个前沿LLM（DeepSeek R1、Gemini 2.5 Pro、GPT-5）在PDDL规划任务上的表现，发现GPT-5在标准PDDL域中与LAMA规划器竞争，但在混淆测试中所有模型性能下降。

Motivation: 评估前沿LLM在端到端规划任务中的推理能力，特别是与专业规划器的性能差距。

Method: 使用国际规划竞赛学习轨道的PDDL域和任务子集，比较LLM与LAMA规划器在标准PDDL和混淆PDDL任务上的表现。

Result: GPT-5在标准PDDL域中解决任务的能力与LAMA竞争；所有LLM在混淆测试中性能下降，但下降程度小于先前报告的其他模型。

Conclusion: 前沿LLM在规划任务上相比前代有显著改进，在挑战性基准上与规划器的性能差距缩小。

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning remains an active area of research, with the capabilities of frontier models continually advancing. We provide an updated evaluation of the end-to-end planning performance of three frontier LLMs as of 2025, where models are prompted to generate a plan from PDDL domain and task descriptions. We evaluate DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 and as reference the planner LAMA on a subset of domains from the most recent Learning Track of the International Planning Competition. Our results show that on standard PDDL domains, the performance of GPT-5 in terms of solved tasks is competitive with LAMA. When the PDDL domains and tasks are obfuscated to test for pure reasoning, the performance of all LLMs degrades, though less severely than previously reported for other models. These results show substantial improvements over prior generations of LLMs, reducing the performance gap to planners on a challenging benchmark.

Motivation: 在高维领域中进行科学发现需要访问学习表示中的信息，但目前缺乏有效方法来分析、控制和重新利用潜在表示。

Method: 基于潜在流匹配与分类器自由引导，显式分离条件信息和残差表示，从而解耦潜在子空间。

Abstract: Accessing information in learned representations is critical for scientific discovery in high-dimensional domains. We introduce a novel method based on latent flow matching with classifier-free guidance that disentangles latent subspaces by explicitly separating information included in conditioning from information that remains in the residual representation. Across three experiments -- a synthetic 2D Gaussian toy problem, colored MNIST, and the Galaxy10 astronomy dataset -- we show that our method enables access to meaningful features of high dimensional data. Our results highlight a simple yet powerful mechanism for analyzing, controlling, and repurposing latent representations, providing a pathway toward using generative models for scientific exploration of what we don't capture, consider, or catalog.

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注高层次描述或视觉问答，缺乏对实际执行能力的评估。CrochetBench旨在填补这一空白，通过评估模型在真实创造性领域中的程序能力，揭示表面理解与可执行精度之间的差距。

Method: 采用CrochetPARADE DSL作为中间表示，支持结构验证和通过执行进行功能评估。基准涵盖针法分类、指令接地以及自然语言和图像到DSL的翻译任务。

Result: 在所有任务中，当评估从表面相似性转向可执行正确性时，模型性能急剧下降，暴露了长距离符号推理和3D感知程序合成的局限性。

Conclusion: CrochetBench为评估多模态模型的程序能力提供了新视角，突显了在真实创造性领域中表面理解与可执行精度之间的显著差距。

Abstract: We present CrochetBench, a benchmark for evaluating the ability of multimodal large language models to perform fine-grained, low-level procedural reasoning in the domain of crochet. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-level description or visual question answering, CrochetBench shifts the emphasis from describing to doing: models are required to recognize stitches, select structurally appropriate instructions, and generate compilable crochet procedures. We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis. CrochetBench offers a new lens for assessing procedural competence in multimodal models and highlights the gap between surface-level understanding and executable precision in real-world creative domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种基于多模型共识采样的AI安全方法，通过聚合多个生成模型的安全性来增强整体安全，当模型间达成足够共识时输出结果，否则弃权。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI安全方法主要依赖检查模型输出或激活，但某些风险无法仅通过检查发现，需要一种架构无关的补充方法。

Method: 使用共识采样算法，给定k个模型和提示，实现与最安全的s个模型平均风险相当的安全性，当模型间缺乏足够共识时弃权。

Result: 该方法能够将未知安全子集的安全保证放大到单个可靠模型，但需要安全模型间有一定重叠，且当所有模型都不安全时无法提供保护。

Conclusion: 提供了一种新的模型无关AI安全方法，通过聚合多个模型来增强安全保证，是现有安全检查方法的有效补充。

Abstract: Many approaches to AI safety rely on inspecting model outputs or activations, yet certain risks are inherently undetectable by inspection alone. We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use. Nonetheless, our results provide a new, model-agnostic approach for AI safety by amplifying safety guarantees from an unknown subset of models within a collection to that of a single reliable model.

Method: 提出了六个基本原理：具身化、感官感知、运动行动、学习、自主性和情境敏感性，这些原理构成一个封闭的控制循环，能量、信息、控制和情境在其中持续互动。

Result: 构建了物理AI的理论框架，展示了六个原理如何作为封闭控制循环运作，使系统能够从物理经验而非数据库中生成意义。

Conclusion: 物理AI将智能理解为物理具身过程，学习是智能体与环境之间结构耦合的变化，而非参数调整。通过康复机器人实例验证了理论模型的有效性。

Abstract: This work will elaborate the fundamental principles of physical artificial intelligence (Physical AI) from a scientific and systemic perspective. The aim is to create a theoretical foundation that describes the physical embodiment, sensory perception, ability to act, learning processes, and context sensitivity of intelligent systems within a coherent framework. While classical AI approaches rely on symbolic processing and data driven models, Physical AI understands intelligence as an emergent phenomenon of real interaction between body, environment, and experience. The six fundamentals presented here are embodiment, sensory perception, motor action, learning, autonomy, and context sensitivity, and form the conceptual basis for designing and evaluating physically intelligent systems. Theoretically, it is shown that these six principles do not represent loose functional modules but rather act as a closed control loop in which energy, information, control, and context are in constant interaction. This circular interaction enables a system to generate meaning not from databases, but from physical experience, a paradigm shift that understands intelligence as an physical embodied process. Physical AI understands learning not as parameter adjustment, but as a change in the structural coupling between agents and the environment. To illustrate this, the theoretical model is explained using a practical scenario: An adaptive assistant robot supports patients in a rehabilitation clinic. This example illustrates that physical intelligence does not arise from abstract calculation, but from immediate, embodied experience. It shows how the six fundamentals interact in a real system: embodiment as a prerequisite, perception as input, movement as expression, learning as adaptation, autonomy as regulation, and context as orientation.

Conclusion: RPO和RPG方法成功解决了对抗优化在合作设置中的自毁问题，为对抗优化在非零和场景中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Adversarial optimization algorithms that explicitly search for flaws in agents' policies have been successfully applied to finding robust and diverse policies in multi-agent settings. However, the success of adversarial optimization has been largely limited to zero-sum settings because its naive application in cooperative settings leads to a critical failure mode: agents are irrationally incentivized to self-sabotage, blocking the completion of tasks and halting further learning. To address this, we introduce Rationality-preserving Policy Optimization (RPO), a formalism for adversarial optimization that avoids self-sabotage by ensuring agents remain rational--that is, their policies are optimal with respect to some possible partner policy. To solve RPO, we develop Rational Policy Gradient (RPG), which trains agents to maximize their own reward in a modified version of the original game in which we use opponent shaping techniques to optimize the adversarial objective. RPG enables us to extend a variety of existing adversarial optimization algorithms that, no longer subject to the limitations of self-sabotage, can find adversarial examples, improve robustness and adaptability, and learn diverse policies. We empirically validate that our approach achieves strong performance in several popular cooperative and general-sum environments.

TL;DR: 比较广度优先搜索(BrFS)和重启随机游走(RRW)在逃离无信息启发式区域(UHR)时的效果，提出EHC-RRW方法并证明其在期望运行时间上的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贪婪搜索方法如GBFS和EHC在遇到启发式局部极小值或平台等UHR时表现不佳，需要有效的方法来逃离这些区域。

Method: 理论推导BrFS和RRW逃离UHR的期望运行时间，提出EHC-RRW方法使用RRW替代BrFS来逃离UHR，并在PDDL规划基准上进行实验验证。

Result: EHC-RRW在EHC有效的场景下具有更强的期望运行时间保证，实验表明RRW在某些情况下比BrFS更有效地逃离UHR。

Conclusion: 重启随机游走是逃离无信息启发式区域的有效方法，EHC-RRW在理论上和实践上都表现出优于标准EHC的潜力。

Abstract: Greedy search methods like Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS) and Enforced Hill-Climbing (EHC) often struggle when faced with Uninformed Heuristic Regions (UHRs) like heuristic local minima or plateaus. In this work, we theoretically and empirically compare two popular methods for escaping UHRs in breadth-first search (BrFS) and restarting random walks (RRWs). We first derive the expected runtime of escaping a UHR using BrFS and RRWs, based on properties of the UHR and the random walk procedure, and then use these results to identify when RRWs will be faster in expectation than BrFS. We then evaluate these methods for escaping UHRs by comparing standard EHC, which uses BrFS to escape UHRs, to variants of EHC called EHC-RRW, which use RRWs for that purpose. EHC-RRW is shown to have strong expected runtime guarantees in cases where EHC has previously been shown to be effective. We also run experiments with these approaches on PDDL planning benchmarks to better understand their relative effectiveness for escaping UHRs.
