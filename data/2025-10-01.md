### [1] [LUMA: Low-Dimension Unified Motion Alignment with Dual-Path Anchoring for Text-to-Motion Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25304)
*Haozhe Jia,Wenshuo Chen,Yuqi Lin,Yang Yang,Lei Wang,Mang Ning,Bowen Tian,Songning Lai,Nanqian Jia,Yifan Chen,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LUMA是一个基于扩散模型的文本到动作生成方法，通过双路径锚定机制解决语义对齐和运动伪影问题，在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于U-Net架构的扩散模型在文本到动作生成任务中存在语义错位和运动伪影问题，深层网络梯度衰减导致高级特征学习不足。

Method: 提出LUMA模型，包含两个路径：1）轻量级MoCLIP模型提供时间域语义监督；2）从低频DCT分量提取频域对齐信号。通过时间调制机制自适应融合两个锚点，在去噪过程中从粗对齐逐步过渡到细粒度语义精炼。

Result: 在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上分别获得0.035和0.123的FID分数，达到最先进性能，收敛速度比基线快1.4倍。

Conclusion: LUMA通过双路径锚定机制有效解决了文本到动作生成中的语义对齐问题，是一个高效且可扩展的高保真解决方案。

Abstract: While current diffusion-based models, typically built on U-Net architectures,
have shown promising results on the text-to-motion generation task, they still
suffer from semantic misalignment and kinematic artifacts. Through analysis, we
identify severe gradient attenuation in the deep layers of the network as a key
bottleneck, leading to insufficient learning of high-level features. To address
this issue, we propose \textbf{LUMA} (\textit{\textbf{L}ow-dimension
\textbf{U}nified \textbf{M}otion \textbf{A}lignment}), a text-to-motion
diffusion model that incorporates dual-path anchoring to enhance semantic
alignment. The first path incorporates a lightweight MoCLIP model trained via
contrastive learning without relying on external data, offering semantic
supervision in the temporal domain. The second path introduces complementary
alignment signals in the frequency domain, extracted from low-frequency DCT
components known for their rich semantic content. These two anchors are
adaptively fused through a temporal modulation mechanism, allowing the model to
progressively transition from coarse alignment to fine-grained semantic
refinement throughout the denoising process. Experimental results on HumanML3D
and KIT-ML demonstrate that LUMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
FID scores of 0.035 and 0.123, respectively. Furthermore, LUMA accelerates
convergence by 1.4$\times$ compared to the baseline, making it an efficient and
scalable solution for high-fidelity text-to-motion generation.

### [2] [VisualOverload: Probing Visual Understanding of VLMs in Really Dense Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25339)
*Paul Gavrikov,Wei Lin,M. Jehanzeb Mirza,Soumya Jahagirdar,Muhammad Huzaifa,Sivan Doveh,Serena Yeung-Levy,James Glass,Hilde Kuehne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisualOverload是一个新的视觉问答基准测试，包含2720个问题-答案对，专注于在密集场景中测试模型的基本视觉理解能力。该数据集使用公共领域绘画的高分辨率扫描，包含多个人物、动作和复杂背景。测试显示即使是表现最好的模型在最具挑战性的测试集上准确率仅为19.6%，总体准确率为69.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在基本视觉理解方面可能被高估，特别是在处理密集场景时。作者认为现有基准测试主要关注全局图像理解，而忽略了模型在复杂、细节丰富的场景中执行简单视觉任务的能力。

Method: 创建了VisualOverload数据集，包含高分辨率公共领域绘画扫描，这些图像具有密集的人物、动作和复杂背景。手动标注了六个任务类别的问题，用于全面测试场景理解能力。评估了37个模型的表现。

Result: 测试结果显示，即使是表现最好的模型(o3)在最具挑战性的测试集上准确率仅为19.6%，总体准确率为69.5%。错误分析揭示了多种失败模式，包括计数能力不足、OCR失败以及在复杂任务中的逻辑不一致。

Conclusion: VisualOverload暴露了当前视觉模型在密集场景理解方面的关键差距，为社区开发更好的模型提供了重要资源。当前模型在处理细节编码和推理方面仍面临挑战。

Abstract: Is basic visual understanding really solved in state-of-the-art VLMs? We
present VisualOverload, a slightly different visual question answering (VQA)
benchmark comprising 2,720 question-answer pairs, with privately held
ground-truth responses. Unlike prior VQA datasets that typically focus on near
global image understanding, VisualOverload challenges models to perform simple,
knowledge-free vision tasks in densely populated (or, overloaded) scenes. Our
dataset consists of high-resolution scans of public-domain paintings that are
populated with multiple figures, actions, and unfolding subplots set against
elaborately detailed backdrops. We manually annotated these images with
questions across six task categories to probe for a thorough understanding of
the scene. We hypothesize that current benchmarks overestimate the performance
of VLMs, and encoding and reasoning over details is still a challenging task
for them, especially if they are confronted with densely populated scenes.
Indeed, we observe that even the best model (o3) out of 37 tested models only
achieves 19.6% accuracy on our hardest test split and overall 69.5% accuracy on
all questions. Beyond a thorough evaluation, we complement our benchmark with
an error analysis that reveals multiple failure modes, including a lack of
counting skills, failure in OCR, and striking logical inconsistencies under
complex tasks. Altogether, VisualOverload exposes a critical gap in current
vision models and offers a crucial resource for the community to develop better
models.

### [3] [Editing Physiological Signals in Videos Using Latent Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25348)
*Tianwen Zhou,Akshay Paruchuri,Josef Spjut,Kaan Akşit*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个学习框架来编辑视频中的生理信号（心率）同时保持视觉保真度，通过3D VAE编码、文本提示融合和FiLM调制实现可控的心率编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于摄像头的心率估计存在隐私风险，因为面部视频中的生命体征可能泄露个人健康和情绪状态等敏感信息。

Method: 使用预训练的3D VAE编码输入视频，通过冻结文本编码器嵌入目标心率提示，使用可训练的时空层和AdaLN进行融合，在解码器中应用FiLM和微调输出层以避免生理信号退化。

Result: 在选定数据集上平均PSNR为38.96 dB，SSIM为0.98，使用最先进rPPG估计器的心率调制误差为10.00 bpm MAE和10.09% MAPE。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持视觉质量的同时实现了可控的心率编辑，可用于匿名化真实视频中的生物特征信号或合成具有所需生命体征的逼真视频。

Abstract: Camera-based physiological signal estimation provides a non-contact and
convenient means to monitor Heart Rate (HR). However, the presence of vital
signals in facial videos raises significant privacy concerns, as they can
reveal sensitive personal information related to the health and emotional
states of an individual. To address this, we propose a learned framework that
edits physiological signals in videos while preserving visual fidelity. First,
we encode an input video into a latent space via a pretrained 3D Variational
Autoencoder (3D VAE), while a target HR prompt is embedded through a frozen
text encoder. We fuse them using a set of trainable spatio-temporal layers with
Adaptive Layer Normalizations (AdaLN) to capture the strong temporal coherence
of remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals. We apply Feature-wise Linear
Modulation (FiLM) in the decoder with a fine-tuned output layer to avoid the
degradation of physiological signals during reconstruction, enabling accurate
physiological modulation in the reconstructed video. Empirical results show
that our method preserves visual quality with an average PSNR of 38.96 dB and
SSIM of 0.98 on selected datasets, while achieving an average HR modulation
error of 10.00 bpm MAE and 10.09% MAPE using a state-of-the-art rPPG estimator.
Our design's controllable HR editing is useful for applications such as
anonymizing biometric signals in real videos or synthesizing realistic videos
with desired vital signs.

### [4] [SpinBench: Perspective and Rotation as a Lens on Spatial Reasoning in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25390)
*Yuyou Zhang,Radu Corcodel,Chiori Hori,Anoop Cherian,Ding Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpinBench是一个用于评估视觉语言模型空间推理能力的诊断基准，专注于视角转换这一核心挑战，包含翻译、旋转、物体相对姿态和视角变化等细粒度诊断类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于空间推理需要多种认知能力，如跨视图识别物体、相对位置定位和心理模拟变换，因此需要构建一个能够系统评估这些能力的基准。

Method: 设计了包含翻译、旋转、物体相对姿态和视角变化等细粒度诊断类别的基准，从单物体简单任务逐步过渡到多物体视角转换的复杂任务，评估了37个最先进的视觉语言模型。

Result: 结果显示VLM存在系统性弱点：强烈的自我中心偏见、旋转理解能力差、在对称和句法重构下表现不一致。人类准确率高达91.2%，人类反应时间与VLM准确率强相关。

Conclusion: SpinBench为理解VLM的空间推理能力提供了关键见解，并突显了它们在物理空间推理方面的关键差距。

Abstract: We present SpinBench, a cognitively grounded diagnostic benchmark for
evaluating spatial reasoning in vision language models (VLMs). SpinBench is
designed around the core challenge of spatial reasoning: perspective taking,
the ability to reason about how scenes and object relations change under
viewpoint transformation. Since perspective taking requires multiple cognitive
capabilities, such as recognizing objects across views, relative positions
grounding, and mentally simulating transformations, SpinBench introduces a set
of fine-grained diagnostic categories. Our categories target translation,
rotation, object relative pose, and viewpoint change, and are progressively
structured so that single-object simpler tasks scaffold toward the most
demanding multi-object perspective-taking setting. We evaluate 37
state-of-the-art VLMs, both proprietary and open source. Results reveal
systematic weaknesses: strong egocentric bias, poor rotational understanding,
and inconsistencies under symmetrical and syntactic reformulations. Scaling
analysis shows both smooth improvements and emergent capabilities. While human
subjects achieve high accuracy (91.2\%), task difficulty as measured by human
response time shows strong correlation with VLM accuracy, indicating that
SpinBench captures spatial reasoning challenges shared across humans and VLMs.
We believe SpinBench provides critical insights into spatial reasoning in VLMs
and highlights key gaps in their ability to reason about physical space. Our

### [5] [A Deep Learning Approach for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of InSAR Ground Deformation in Eastern Ireland](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25393)
*Wendong Yao,Binhua Huang,Soumyabrata Dev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出多模态时空变换器(MM-STT)，通过融合动态位移数据和静态物理先验，显著提升高分辨率地面沉降预测精度，在EGMS数据集上实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如ConvLSTM难以建模长程依赖关系，且现有工作局限于单模态数据范式，无法充分利用多源信息进行地面沉降预测。

Method: 设计多模态时空变换器，采用联合时空注意力机制统一处理所有多模态特征，实现深度多模态融合。

Result: 在EGMS数据集上建立新的最先进水平，相比包括STGCN和STAEformer在内的所有基线方法，长程预测RMSE降低了一个数量级。

Conclusion: 对于此类问题，架构内在的深度多模态融合能力对于实现变革性性能至关重要。

Abstract: Forecasting high-resolution land subsidence is a critical yet challenging
task due to its complex, non-linear dynamics. While standard architectures like
ConvLSTM often fail to model long-range dependencies, we argue that a more
fundamental limitation of prior work lies in the uni-modal data paradigm. To
address this, we propose the Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer (MM-STT),
a novel framework that fuses dynamic displacement data with static physical
priors. Its core innovation is a joint spatio-temporal attention mechanism that
processes all multi-modal features in a unified manner. On the public EGMS
dataset, MM-STT establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing the long-range
forecast RMSE by an order of magnitude compared to all baselines, including
SOTA methods like STGCN and STAEformer. Our results demonstrate that for this
class of problems, an architecture's inherent capacity for deep multi-modal
fusion is paramount for achieving transformative performance.

### [6] [DepthLM: Metric Depth From Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25413)
*Zhipeng Cai,Ching-Feng Yeh,Hu Xu,Zhuang Liu,Gregory Meyer,Xinjie Lei,Changsheng Zhao,Shang-Wen Li,Vikas Chandra,Yangyang Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs可以通过文本监督微调和视觉提示达到专家级深度估计精度，无需专门架构或损失函数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VLMs在3D理解（特别是深度估计）方面的不足，同时保持其灵活性和通用性

Method: 使用稀疏标签的文本监督微调，结合视觉提示和相机内参条件增强来解决像素参考和跨数据集相机模糊问题

Result: DepthLM方法使VLMs在深度估计精度上超越最先进VLMs 2倍以上，首次可与纯视觉模型媲美

Conclusion: VLMs通过适当训练可以解锁强大的3D理解能力，且自然避免过平滑问题，能够覆盖多种3D任务

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) can flexibly address various vision tasks
through text interactions. Although successful in semantic understanding,
state-of-the-art VLMs including GPT-5 still struggle in understanding 3D from
2D inputs. On the other hand, expert pure vision models achieve super-human
accuracy in metric depth estimation, a key 3D understanding task. However, they
require task-specific architectures and losses. Such difference motivates us to
ask: Can VLMs reach expert-level accuracy without architecture or loss change?
We take per-pixel metric depth estimation as the representative task and show
that the answer is yes! Surprisingly, comprehensive analysis shows that
text-based supervised-finetuning with sparse labels is sufficient for VLMs to
unlock strong 3D understanding, no dense prediction head or complex
regression/regularization loss is needed. The bottleneck for VLMs lies actually
in pixel reference and cross-dataset camera ambiguity, which we address through
visual prompting and intrinsic-conditioned augmentation. With much smaller
models, our method DepthLM surpasses the accuracy of most advanced VLMs by over
2x, making VLMs for the first time comparable with pure vision models.
Interestingly, without explicit enforcement during training, VLMs trained with
DepthLM naturally avoids over-smoothing, having much fewer flying points at
boundary regions than pure vision models. The simplicity of DepthLM also
enables a single VLM to cover various 3D tasks beyond metric depth. Our code
and model will be released at the link below.

### [7] [Bayesian Transformer for Pan-Arctic Sea Ice Concentration Mapping and Uncertainty Estimation using Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2 Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25437)
*Mabel Heffring,Lincoln Linlin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的贝叶斯Transformer方法，用于泛北极海冰浓度制图和不确定性量化，结合Sentinel-1、RCM和AMSR2数据，实现了高分辨率海冰制图和可靠的不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 泛北极高分辨率海冰制图及其不确定性量化对海冰浓度制图至关重要，但由于冰特征细微、模型不确定性和数据异质性等挑战而难以实现。

Method: 设计了具有全局和局部模块的高分辨率Transformer模型以改进特征提取；开发了贝叶斯扩展版本以更好地量化不确定性；在决策层面融合三种不同类型的数据（Sentinel-1、RCM和AMSR2）以解决数据异质性。

Result: 在2021年9月的泛北极数据集上测试，结果显示该方法相比其他不确定性量化方法，能够同时实现高分辨率海冰制图和稳健的不确定性制图。

Conclusion: 所提出的贝叶斯Transformer方法有效解决了泛北极海冰制图中的关键挑战，为高分辨率海冰浓度制图和不确定性量化提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Although high-resolution mapping of Pan-Arctic sea ice with reliable
corresponding uncertainty is essential for operational sea ice concentration
(SIC) charting, it is a difficult task due to some key challenges, e.g., the
subtle nature of ice signature features, model uncertainty, and data
heterogeneity. This letter presents a novel Bayesian Transformer approach for
Pan-Arctic SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification using Sentinel-1,
RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), and Advanced Microwave Scanning
Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) data. First, to improve feature extraction, we design a
novel high-resolution Transformer model with both global and local modules that
can better discern the subtle differences in sea ice patterns. Second, to
improve uncertainty quantification, we design a Bayesian extension of the
proposed Transformer model, treating its parameters as random variables to more
effectively capture uncertainties. Third, to address data heterogeneity, we
fuse three different data types (Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2) at decision-level
to improve both SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification. The proposed
approach is tested on Pan-Arctic datasets from September 2021, and the results
demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve both high-resolution SIC maps
and robust uncertainty maps compared to other uncertainty quantification
approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种基于路边摄像头和LiDAR传感器的车辆检测与定位框架，采用卡尔曼滤波融合策略，在复杂道路环境中实现精确的车辆轨迹跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于基础设施的感知系统在实际部署中面临的角度畸变、复杂几何、遮挡和成本等障碍，为高风险路段（如施工区）提供主动安全措施。

Method: 集成路边摄像头和LiDAR传感器到联合仿真环境，开发可扩展的车辆检测定位框架，采用基于卡尔曼滤波的后期融合策略提升轨迹一致性和精度。

Result: 仿真中融合算法将纵向误差降低70%，横向精度保持在1-3米内；现场验证显示融合轨迹能准确匹配真实车辆路径，即使在单传感器数据中断或降级时也能保持可靠性。

Conclusion: KF传感器融合能可靠补偿单个传感器局限，提供精确鲁棒的车辆跟踪能力，为复杂交通环境中部署基础设施支持的多传感器系统提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Infrastructure-based sensing and real-time trajectory generation show promise
for improving safety in high-risk roadway segments such as work zones, yet
practical deployments are hindered by perspective distortion, complex geometry,
occlusions, and costs. This study tackles these barriers by integrating
roadside camera and LiDAR sensors into a cosimulation environment to develop a
scalable, cost-effective vehicle detection and localization framework, and
employing a Kalman Filter-based late fusion strategy to enhance trajectory
consistency and accuracy. In simulation, the fusion algorithm reduced
longitudinal error by up to 70 percent compared to individual sensors while
preserving lateral accuracy within 1 to 3 meters. Field validation in an active
work zone, using LiDAR, a radar-camera rig, and RTK-GPS as ground truth,
demonstrated that the fused trajectories closely match real vehicle paths, even
when single-sensor data are intermittent or degraded. These results confirm
that KF based sensor fusion can reliably compensate for individual sensor
limitations, providing precise and robust vehicle tracking capabilities. Our
approach thus offers a practical pathway to deploy infrastructure-enabled
multi-sensor systems for proactive safety measures in complex traffic
environments.

### [9] [Seeing Before Reasoning: A Unified Framework for Generalizable and Explainable Fake Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25502)
*Kaiqing Lin,Zhiyuan Yan,Ruoxin Chen,Junyan Ye,Ke-Yue Zhang,Yue Zhou,Peng Jin,Bin Li,Taiping Yao,Shouhong Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Forensic-Chat方法，通过"先观察后推理"的新范式，让多模态大语言模型在检测AI生成图像时先增强对伪造痕迹的感知能力，再基于实际观察进行推理，解决了现有方法因视觉感知不足导致的性能不佳问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在检测AI生成图像时性能不佳，根本原因在于模型在真正"看到"伪造痕迹之前就被要求进行推理。视觉编码器主要针对语义识别优化，对低级别伪造信号不敏感，且微调数据与预训练分布差异大，导致模型依赖语言捷径而遗忘预训练知识。

Method: 提出"先观察后推理"范式：1）先训练MLLMs感知伪造痕迹，增强其伪迹感知视觉能力；2）提出Forensic-Chat，一个可泛化、可解释且支持多轮对话的假图像检测助手；3）构建ExplainFake-Bench基准，从五个关键方面评估MLLMs在图像取证中的可解释性。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法在泛化性和真正可靠的可解释性方面具有优越性，能够有效提升AI生成图像检测性能。

Conclusion: 通过强化MLLMs的伪迹感知视觉能力，使其在检测AI生成图像时能够基于实际观察进行推理，解决了现有方法因视觉感知不足导致的性能限制，实现了更好的泛化能力和可靠的可解释性。

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated images with multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
has gained increasing attention, due to their rich world knowledge,
common-sense reasoning, and potential for explainability. However, naively
applying those MLLMs for detection often leads to suboptimal performance. We
argue that the root of this failure lies in a fundamental mismatch: MLLMs are
asked to reason about fakes before they can truly see them. First, they do not
really see: existing MLLMs' vision encoders are primarily optimized for
semantic-oriented recognition rather than the perception of low-level signals,
leaving them insensitive to subtle forgery traces. Without access to reliable
perceptual evidence, the model grounds its judgment on incomplete and limited
visual observations. Second, existing finetuning data for detection typically
uses narrow, instruction-style formats, which diverge sharply from the diverse,
heterogeneous distributions seen in pretraining. In the absence of meaningful
visual cues, the model therefore exploits these linguistic shortcuts, resulting
in catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge (even the basic dialogue
capabilities). In response, we advocate for a new paradigm: seeing before
reasoning. We propose that MLLMs should first be trained to perceive
artifacts-strengthening their artifact-aware visual perception-so that
subsequent reasoning is grounded in actual observations. We therefore propose
Forensic-Chat, a generalizable, explainable, and still-conversational (for
multi-round dialogue) assistant for fake image detection. We also propose
ExplainFake-Bench, a benchmark tailored for the evaluation of the MLLM's
explainability for image forensics from five key aspects. Extensive experiments
show its superiority of generalization and genuinely reliable explainability.

*Odin Kohler,Rahul Vijaykumar,Masudul H. Imtiaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用视线追踪技术检测实时视频会议中深度伪造攻击的方法，通过分析对话中的视线模式来识别深度伪造视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度伪造技术的发展，恶意行为者开始在视频会议中进行实时钓鱼攻击。深度伪造无法模仿人类对话中微妙的非语言视线交流模式。

Method: 基于对二元对话中视线模式的研究，选择可解释的特征构建模型，利用攻击者视频流中的估计视线来检测深度伪造。

Result: 在自建数据集上测试，准确率达到82%，这是首个利用视线追踪进行深度伪造检测的方法。

Conclusion: 视线追踪为深度伪造检测提供了新的生物特征信息，能够有效识别实时视频会议中的深度伪造攻击。

Abstract: With recent advancements in deepfake technology, it is now possible to
generate convincing deepfakes in real-time. Unfortunately, malicious actors
have started to use this new technology to perform real-time phishing attacks
during video meetings. The nature of a video call allows access to what the
deepfake is ``seeing,'' that is, the screen displayed to the malicious actor.
Using this with the estimated gaze from the malicious actors streamed video
enables us to estimate where the deepfake is looking on screen, the point of
gaze. Because the point of gaze during conversations is not random and is
instead used as a subtle nonverbal communicator, it can be used to detect
deepfakes, which are not capable of mimicking this subtle nonverbal
communication. This paper proposes a real-time deepfake detection method
adapted to this genre of attack, utilizing previously unavailable biometric
information. We built our model based on explainable features selected after
careful review of research on gaze patterns during dyadic conversations. We
then test our model on a novel dataset of our creation, achieving an accuracy
of 82\%. This is the first reported method to utilize point-of-gaze tracking
for deepfake detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于视觉的6自由度物体姿态估计算法，专门用于火星样本返回任务中的受限硬件环境，通过自定义渲染器和边缘域模板匹配实现稳健的姿态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决火星样本返回任务中机械臂在严重硬件约束下对多个目标物体进行低间隙拾取和插入时的定位问题。

Method: 使用自定义渲染器和针对边缘域设计的新模板匹配度量，仅需低精度、无纹理的3D模型作为输入。

Result: 在合成数据集、地球物理测试台和火星实地图像上的广泛评估表明，该方法在计算和内存受限的定位任务中，在鲁棒性和准确性方面均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法为通用硬件上的廉价可靠定位开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of vision-based 6-DoF object pose estimation in the
context of the notional Mars Sample Return campaign, in which a robotic arm
would need to localize multiple objects of interest for low-clearance pickup
and insertion, under severely constrained hardware. We propose a novel
localization algorithm leveraging a custom renderer together with a new
template matching metric tailored to the edge domain to achieve robust pose
estimation using only low-fidelity, textureless 3D models as inputs. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic datasets as well as from physical testbeds on Earth
and in situ Mars imagery shows that our method consistently beats the state of
the art in compute and memory-constrained localization, both in terms of
robustness and accuracy, in turn enabling new possibilities for cheap and
reliable localization on general-purpose hardware.

*Pranav Saxena,Avigyan Bhattacharya,Ji Zhang,Wenshan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLM-RG是一个结合视觉语言模型和大型语言模型的混合管道，用于解决户外驾驶场景中的指称定位问题，在Talk2Car基准测试中显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 户外驾驶场景中的指称定位具有挑战性，因为场景变化大、视觉相似对象多、动态元素复杂，使得解析自然语言指称（如"右边的黑色汽车"）变得困难。

Method: 提出LLM-RG混合管道：使用LLM提取相关对象类型和属性，检测候选区域，用VLM生成丰富的视觉描述符，结合空间元数据构建自然语言提示，通过LLM进行链式推理来识别指称对象的边界框。

Result: 在Talk2Car基准测试中，LLM-RG相比基于LLM和VLM的基线方法取得了显著提升，添加3D空间线索进一步改善了定位效果。

Conclusion: 研究证明了VLM和LLM在零样本设置下的互补优势，能够实现鲁棒的户外指称定位。

Abstract: Referential grounding in outdoor driving scenes is challenging due to large
scene variability, many visually similar objects, and dynamic elements that
complicate resolving natural-language references (e.g., "the black car on the
right"). We propose LLM-RG, a hybrid pipeline that combines off-the-shelf
vision-language models for fine-grained attribute extraction with large
language models for symbolic reasoning. LLM-RG processes an image and a
free-form referring expression by using an LLM to extract relevant object types
and attributes, detecting candidate regions, generating rich visual descriptors
with a VLM, and then combining these descriptors with spatial metadata into
natural-language prompts that are input to an LLM for chain-of-thought
reasoning to identify the referent's bounding box. Evaluated on the Talk2Car
benchmark, LLM-RG yields substantial gains over both LLM and VLM-based
baselines. Additionally, our ablations show that adding 3D spatial cues further
improves grounding. Our results demonstrate the complementary strengths of VLMs
and LLMs, applied in a zero-shot manner, for robust outdoor referential
grounding.

*Ravikumar Balakrishnan,Mansi Phute*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISOR++是一种通过优化视觉输入实现多模态语言模型行为控制的方法，无需运行时访问模型内部，适用于开放和闭源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有行为控制方法存在局限性：系统提示容易被用户指令覆盖，基于激活的转向向量需要访问模型内部，无法用于API服务和闭源模型。需要开发跨模型通用的转向方法。

Method: 通过生成优化的视觉输入（VISOR++图像）来诱导目标激活模式，实现行为控制。该方法为VLM集合生成单一图像来模拟转向向量，无需运行时模型访问。

Result: VISOR++图像在LLaVA-1.5-7B和IDEFICS2-8B等模型上实现了与转向向量相当的性能，在拒绝、奉承和生存本能三个对齐方向上有效。对未见模型也表现出行为转向能力，且在14,000个MMLU评估任务上保持99.9%性能。

Conclusion: VISOR++提供了一种部署无关的行为控制方法，通过视觉输入实现多模态模型的安全对齐，无需侵入式模型访问，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) are deployed across safety-critical
applications, understanding and controlling their behavioral patterns has
become increasingly important. Existing behavioral control methods face
significant limitations: system prompting approaches could easily be overridden
by user instructions, while applying activation-based steering vectors requires
invasive runtime access to model internals, precluding deployment with
API-based services and closed-source models. Finding steering methods that
transfer across multiple VLMs is still an open area of research. To this end,
we introduce universal visual input based steering for output redirection
(VISOR++), to achieve behavioral control through optimized visual inputs alone.
We demonstrate that a single VISOR++ image can be generated for an ensemble of
VLMs to emulate each of their steering vectors. By crafting universal visual
inputs that induce target activation patterns, VISOR++ eliminates the need for
runtime model access while remaining deployment-agnostic. This means that when
an underlying model supports multimodal capability, model behaviors can be
steered by inserting an image input replacing runtime steering vector based
interventions. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the VISOR++ images on
open-access models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and IDEFICS2-8B along three alignment
directions: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. Both the model-specific
steering images and the jointly optimized images achieve performance parity
closely following that of steering vectors for both positive and negative
steering tasks. We also show the promise of VISOR++ images in achieving
directional behavioral shifts for unseen models including both open-access and
closed-access ones. Furthermore, VISOR++ images are able to preserve 99.9%
performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU evaluation tasks.

TL;DR: Vision-Zero是一个无需人工标注的视觉语言模型自改进框架，通过任意图像对生成竞争性视觉游戏来提升模型推理能力，在多项任务上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前强化学习方法依赖人工构建数据集导致训练成本高、限制视觉语言模型实际部署的问题。

Method: 提出包含三个核心特性的框架：战略自博弈框架（类似"谁是卧底"游戏）、任意图像生成游戏能力、迭代自博弈策略优化算法（结合自博弈和可验证奖励的强化学习）。

Result: 在推理、图表问答和视觉理解任务上达到最先进性能，超越了基于标注的方法，展示了强大的跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: Vision-Zero证明了视觉语言模型可以通过无标注的自博弈实现持续性能提升，为实际部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Although reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively enhance the reasoning
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs), current methods remain heavily
dependent on labor-intensive datasets that require extensive manual
construction and verification, leading to extremely high training costs and
consequently constraining the practical deployment of VLMs. To address this
challenge, we propose Vision-Zero, a domain-agnostic framework enabling VLM
self-improvement through competitive visual games generated from arbitrary
image pairs. Specifically, Vision-Zero encompasses three main attributes: (1)
Strategic Self-Play Framework: Vision-Zero trains VLMs in "Who Is the
Spy"-style games, where the models engage in strategic reasoning and actions
across multiple roles. Through interactive gameplay, models autonomously
generate their training data without human annotation. (2) Gameplay from
Arbitrary Images: Unlike existing gamified frameworks, Vision-Zero can generate
games from arbitrary images, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning ability
across diverse domains and showing strong generalization to different tasks. We
demonstrate this versatility using three distinct types of image datasets:
CLEVR-based synthetic scenes, charts, and real-world images. (3) Sustainable
Performance Gain: We introduce Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization
(Iterative-SPO), a novel training algorithm that alternates between Self-Play
and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), mitigating the
performance plateau often seen in self-play-only training and achieving
sustained long-term improvements. Despite using label-free data, Vision-Zero
achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning, chart question answering,
and vision-centric understanding tasks, surpassing other annotation-based
methods. Models and code has been released at

Abstract: Choroidal nevi are common benign pigmented lesions in the eye, with a small
risk of transforming into melanoma. Early detection is critical to improving
survival rates, but misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis can lead to poor
outcomes. Despite advancements in AI-based image analysis, diagnosing choroidal
nevi in colour fundus images remains challenging, particularly for clinicians
without specialized expertise. Existing datasets often suffer from low
resolution and inconsistent labelling, limiting the effectiveness of
segmentation models. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving precise
segmentation of fundus lesions, a critical step toward developing robust
diagnostic tools. While deep learning models like U-Net have demonstrated
effectiveness, their accuracy heavily depends on the quality and quantity of
annotated data. Previous mathematical/clustering segmentation methods, though
accurate, required extensive human input, making them impractical for medical
applications. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines
mathematical/clustering segmentation models with insights from U-Net,
leveraging the strengths of both methods. This hybrid model improves accuracy,
reduces the need for large-scale training data, and achieves significant
performance gains on high-resolution fundus images. The proposed model achieves
a Dice coefficient of 89.7% and an IoU of 80.01% on 1024*1024 fundus images,
outperforming the Attention U-Net model, which achieved 51.3% and 34.2%,
respectively. It also demonstrated better generalizability on external
datasets. This work forms a part of a broader effort to develop a decision
support system for choroidal nevus diagnosis, with potential applications in
automated lesion annotation to enhance the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and
monitoring.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
cross-domain capabilities, yet their proficiency in specialized scientific
fields like marine biology remains underexplored. In this work, we
systematically evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs and reveal significant
limitations in their ability to perform fine-grained recognition of fish
species, with the best open-source models achieving less than 10\% accuracy.
This task is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems under anthropogenic
pressure. To address this gap and investigate whether these failures stem from
a lack of domain knowledge, we introduce FishNet++, a large-scale, multimodal
benchmark. FishNet++ significantly extends existing resources with 35,133
textual descriptions for multimodal learning, 706,426 key-point annotations for
morphological studies, and 119,399 bounding boxes for detection. By providing

Abstract: Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) have demonstrated promising performance
in image recognition tasks against Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
Vision Transformers (ViTs). An essential part of the ViG framework is the
node-neighbor feature aggregation method. Although various graph convolution
methods, such as Max-Relative, EdgeConv, GIN, and GraphSAGE, have been
explored, a versatile aggregation method that effectively captures complex
node-neighbor relationships without requiring architecture-specific refinements
is needed. To address this gap, we propose a cross-attention-based aggregation
method in which the query projections come from the node, while the key
projections come from its neighbors. Additionally, we introduce a novel
architecture called AttentionViG that uses the proposed cross-attention
aggregation scheme to conduct non-local message passing. We evaluated the image
recognition performance of AttentionViG on the ImageNet-1K benchmark, where it
achieved SOTA performance. Additionally, we assessed its transferability to
downstream tasks, including object detection and instance segmentation on MS
COCO 2017, as well as semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Our results demonstrate
that the proposed method not only achieves strong performance, but also
maintains efficiency, delivering competitive accuracy with comparable FLOPs to
prior vision GNN architectures.

TL;DR: 本文提出了MetaChest数据集，包含479,215张胸部X光片，用于研究医学图像中的广义少样本分类问题。实验表明，增加每集类别数和每类训练样本数可提升性能，迁移学习方法优于专门设计的少样本学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分析中标注数据稀缺，传统少样本学习假设所有类别都是新的，而实际医学应用需要同时学习新类别并利用已知类别知识，这种广义少样本分类场景研究较少。

Method: 构建MetaChest大规模胸部X光数据集，设计元集划分和多标签集生成算法，评估标准迁移学习方法和ProtoNet扩展方法在各种少样本多标签分类任务中的表现。

Result: 增加每集类别数和每类训练样本数可提高分类性能；迁移学习方法持续优于ProtoNet扩展；高分辨率图像以额外计算为代价提高精度；高效模型架构在显著减少资源需求下达到可比性能。

Conclusion: MetaChest数据集为医学图像少样本学习提供了重要基准，迁移学习在广义少样本分类中表现优异，为实际医学应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The limited availability of annotated data presents a major challenge for
applying deep learning methods to medical image analysis. Few-shot learning
methods aim to recognize new classes from only a small number of labeled
examples. These methods are typically studied under the standard few-shot
learning setting, where all classes in a task are new. However, medical
applications such as pathology classification from chest X-rays often require
learning new classes while simultaneously leveraging knowledge of previously
known ones, a scenario more closely aligned with generalized few-shot
classification. Despite its practical relevance, few-shot learning has been
scarcely studied in this context. In this work, we present MetaChest, a
large-scale dataset of 479,215 chest X-rays collected from four public
databases. MetaChest includes a meta-set partition specifically designed for
standard few-shot classification, as well as an algorithm for generating
multi-label episodes. We conduct extensive experiments evaluating both a
standard transfer learning approach and an extension of ProtoNet across a wide
range of few-shot multi-label classification tasks. Our results demonstrate
that increasing the number of classes per episode and the number of training
examples per class improves classification performance. Notably, the transfer
learning approach consistently outperforms the ProtoNet extension, despite not
being tailored for few-shot learning. We also show that higher-resolution
images improve accuracy at the cost of additional computation, while efficient
model architectures achieve comparable performance to larger models with
significantly reduced resource requirements.

TL;DR: K-Prism是一个统一的医学图像分割框架，通过整合语义先验、上下文知识和交互反馈三种知识范式，实现了灵活的多任务分割能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像分割模型通常针对单一任务、模态或器官进行训练，与临床实践中专家整合多种知识源的实际情况不符。

Method: 提出双提示表示法：1-D稀疏提示定义分割内容，2-D密集提示指示关注区域，通过混合专家解码器动态路由这些提示。

Result: 在18个公共数据集上的实验表明，K-Prism在语义分割、上下文分割和交互分割设置中均达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: K-Prism成功模拟了临床实践的灵活性，为医学图像分割提供了一个统一且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is fundamental to clinical decision-making, yet
existing models remain fragmented. They are usually trained on single knowledge
sources and specific to individual tasks, modalities, or organs. This
fragmentation contrasts sharply with clinical practice, where experts
seamlessly integrate diverse knowledge: anatomical priors from training,
exemplar-based reasoning from reference cases, and iterative refinement through
real-time interaction. We present $\textbf{K-Prism}$, a unified segmentation
framework that mirrors this clinical flexibility by systematically integrating
three knowledge paradigms: (i) $\textit{semantic priors}$ learned from
annotated datasets, (ii) $\textit{in-context knowledge}$ from few-shot
reference examples, and (iii) $\textit{interactive feedback}$ from user inputs
like clicks or scribbles. Our key insight is that these heterogeneous knowledge
sources can be encoded into a dual-prompt representation: 1-D sparse prompts
defining $\textit{what}$ to segment and 2-D dense prompts indicating
$\textit{where}$ to attend, which are then dynamically routed through a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder. This design enables flexible switching
between paradigms and joint training across diverse tasks without architectural
modifications. Comprehensive experiments on 18 public datasets spanning diverse
modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, pathology, ultrasound, etc.) demonstrate that
K-Prism achieves state-of-the-art performance across semantic, in-context, and
interactive segmentation settings. Code will be released upon publication.

*Yijia Weng,Zhicheng Wang,Songyou Peng,Saining Xie,Howard Zhou,Leonidas J. Guibas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为GaussianLens的局部高分辨率重建方法，通过按需高斯加密在用户指定区域实现精细细节重建，避免了统一高分辨率重建的高成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类感知具有选择性注意力特性，在场景重建中需要针对关键区域实现不同程度的细节重建。现有3DGS方法要么输出统一分辨率导致高计算成本，要么需要密集观测和长时间离线优化，无法有效利用高分辨率图像重建细节。

Method: 基于低分辨率3DGS重建，学习一个泛化网络来加密初始3DGS以捕捉用户指定感兴趣区域的精细细节。设计了GaussianLens前向加密框架，融合初始3DGS和多视图图像的多模态信息，并采用像素引导的加密机制来有效捕捉大分辨率增加下的细节。

Result: 实验表明该方法在局部精细细节重建方面表现优越，对高达1024×1024分辨率的图像具有强可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了高分辨率整体重建的高成本问题与用户对局部精细细节需求之间的差距，实现了高效、按需的局部高分辨率重建。

Abstract: We perceive our surroundings with an active focus, paying more attention to
regions of interest, such as the shelf labels in a grocery store. When it comes
to scene reconstruction, this human perception trait calls for spatially
varying degrees of detail ready for closer inspection in critical regions,
preferably reconstructed on demand. While recent works in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) achieve fast, generalizable reconstruction from sparse views, their
uniform resolution output leads to high computational costs unscalable to
high-resolution training. As a result, they cannot leverage available images at
their original high resolution to reconstruct details. Per-scene optimization
methods reconstruct finer details with adaptive density control, yet require
dense observations and lengthy offline optimization. To bridge the gap between
the prohibitive cost of high-resolution holistic reconstructions and the user
needs for localized fine details, we propose the problem of localized
high-resolution reconstruction via on-demand Gaussian densification. Given a
low-resolution 3DGS reconstruction, the goal is to learn a generalizable
network that densifies the initial 3DGS to capture fine details in a
user-specified local region of interest (RoI), based on sparse high-resolution
observations of the RoI. This formulation avoids the high cost and redundancy
of uniformly high-resolution reconstructions and fully leverages
high-resolution captures in critical regions. We propose GaussianLens, a
feed-forward densification framework that fuses multi-modal information from
the initial 3DGS and multi-view images. We further design a pixel-guided
densification mechanism that effectively captures details under large
resolution increases. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance
in local fine detail reconstruction and strong scalability to images of up to
$1024\times1024$ resolution.

Motivation: 视力威胁性眼病造成重大全球健康负担，及时诊断受到医疗资源短缺和专科护理可及性限制。多模态大语言模型在医学图像解释方面有潜力，但缺乏适合评估生成模型的综合基准数据集阻碍了眼科MLLMs的发展。

Conclusion: 将公开发布数据集、整理流程和排行榜，有望推动眼科AI应用发展，减轻视力威胁性疾病的全球负担。

Abstract: Vision-threatening eye diseases pose a major global health burden, with
timely diagnosis limited by workforce shortages and restricted access to
specialized care. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise
for medical image interpretation, advancing MLLMs for ophthalmology is hindered
by the lack of comprehensive benchmark datasets suitable for evaluating
generative models. We present a large-scale multimodal ophthalmology benchmark
comprising 32,633 instances with multi-granular annotations across 12 common
ophthalmic conditions and 5 imaging modalities. The dataset integrates imaging,
anatomical structures, demographics, and free-text annotations, supporting
anatomical structure recognition, disease screening, disease staging, and
demographic prediction for bias evaluation. This work extends our preliminary
LMOD benchmark with three major enhancements: (1) nearly 50% dataset expansion
with substantial enlargement of color fundus photography; (2) broadened task
coverage including binary disease diagnosis, multi-class diagnosis, severity
classification with international grading standards, and demographic
prediction; and (3) systematic evaluation of 24 state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our
evaluations reveal both promise and limitations. Top-performing models achieved
~58% accuracy in disease screening under zero-shot settings, and performance
remained suboptimal for challenging tasks like disease staging. We will
publicly release the dataset, curation pipeline, and leaderboard to potentially
advance ophthalmic AI applications and reduce the global burden of
vision-threatening diseases.

Motivation: 现有跨视角物体地理定位方法大多采用基于锚框的范式，这种方法受限于预定义的锚框。为了消除这种依赖，作者希望开发一种无锚框的跨视角物体地理定位方法。

Method: AFGeo直接为每个像素预测到真实边界框的四个方向偏移（左、右、上、下）。采用高斯位置编码来建模查询图像中的点击点，缓解跨视角场景中物体位置的不确定性。还包含跨视角物体关联模块，关联不同视角下的同一物体及其周围上下文。

Result: 该方法在基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，同时模型轻量且计算效率高。

Conclusion: AFGeo通过无锚框定位范式，结合高斯位置编码和跨视角物体关联模块，成功实现了高效准确的跨视角物体地理定位。

Abstract: Most existing cross-view object geo-localization approaches adopt
anchor-based paradigm. Although effective, such methods are inherently
constrained by predefined anchors. To eliminate this dependency, we first
propose an anchor-free formulation for cross-view object geo-localization,
termed AFGeo. AFGeo directly predicts the four directional offsets (left,
right, top, bottom) to the ground-truth box for each pixel, thereby localizing
the object without any predefined anchors. To obtain a more robust spatial
prior, AFGeo incorporates Gaussian Position Encoding (GPE) to model the click
point in the query image, mitigating the uncertainty of object position that
challenges object localization in cross-view scenarios. In addition, AFGeo
incorporates a Cross-view Object Association Module (CVOAM) that relates the
same object and its surrounding context across viewpoints, enabling reliable
localization under large cross-view appearance gaps. By adopting an anchor-free
localization paradigm that integrates GPE and CVOAM with minimal parameter
overhead, our model is both lightweight and computationally efficient,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 现有的跨模态检索模型（如CLIP）在处理融合图像-文本多模态检索时性能下降，而传统方法需要精心构建新的三元组数据集且无法泛化到未见过的模态组合。

Method: GCL在小批量内对所有模态进行对比学习，利用现有的图像-文本配对数据集学习统一的表示空间，无需额外数据标注。

Abstract: Despite their consistent performance improvements, cross-modal retrieval
models (e.g., CLIP) show degraded performances with retrieving keys composed of
fused image-text modality (e.g., Wikipedia pages with both images and text). To
address this critical challenge, multimodal retrieval has been recently
explored to develop a unified single retrieval model capable of retrieving keys
across diverse modality combinations. A common approach involves constructing
new composed sets of image-text triplets (e.g., retrieving a pair of image and
text given a query image). However, such an approach requires careful curation
to ensure the dataset quality and fails to generalize to unseen modality
combinations. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes Generalized
Contrastive Learning (GCL), a novel loss formulation that improves multimodal
retrieval performance without the burdensome need for new dataset curation.
Specifically, GCL operates by enforcing contrastive learning across all
modalities within a mini-batch, utilizing existing image-caption paired
datasets to learn a unified representation space. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of GCL by showing consistent performance improvements on
off-the-shelf multimodal retrieval models (e.g., VISTA, CLIP, and TinyCLIP)
using the M-BEIR, MMEB, and CoVR benchmarks.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) traditionally require large amounts of
data to train models with good performance. However, data collection is an
expensive process, both in time and resources. Generated synthetic images are a
good alternative, with video games producing realistic 3D models. This paper
aims to determine whether images extracted from a video game can be effectively
used to train a CNN to detect real-life truck axles. Three different databases
were created, with real-life and synthetic trucks, to provide training and
testing examples for three different You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures.
Results were evaluated based on four metrics: recall, precision, F1-score, and
mean Average Precision (mAP). To evaluate the statistical significance of the
results, the Mann-Whitney U test was also applied to the resulting mAP of all
models. Synthetic images from trucks extracted from a video game proved to be a
reliable source of training data, contributing to the performance of all
networks. The highest mAP score reached 99\%. Results indicate that synthetic
images can be used to train neural networks, providing a reliable, low-cost
data source for extracting knowledge.

Abstract: Automated textual description of remote sensing images is crucial for
unlocking their full potential in diverse applications, from environmental
monitoring to urban planning and disaster management. However, existing studies
in remote sensing image captioning primarily focus on the image level, lacking
object-level fine-grained interpretation, which prevents the full utilization
and transformation of the rich semantic and structural information contained in
remote sensing images. To address this limitation, we propose Geo-DLC, a novel
task of object-level fine-grained image captioning for remote sensing. To
support this task, we construct DE-Dataset, a large-scale dataset contains 25
categories and 261,806 annotated instances with detailed descriptions of object
attributes, relationships, and contexts. Furthermore, we introduce
DE-Benchmark, a LLM-assisted question-answering based evaluation suite designed
to systematically measure model capabilities on the Geo-DLC task. We also
present DescribeEarth, a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture
explicitly designed for Geo-DLC, which integrates a scale-adaptive focal
strategy and a domain-guided fusion module leveraging remote sensing
vision-language model features to encode high-resolution details and remote
sensing category priors while maintaining global context. Our DescribeEarth
model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art general MLLMs on DE-Benchmark,
demonstrating superior factual accuracy, descriptive richness, and grammatical
soundness, particularly in capturing intrinsic object features and surrounding
environmental attributes across simple, complex, and even out-of-distribution
remote sensing scenarios. All data, code and weights are released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于YOLO的深度学习模型用于工业制造中的自动缺陷检测，使用ConSinGAN进行数据增强来解决金属板材图像数据不足的问题，YOLOv9模型在准确率和检测时间上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工业制造中传统缺陷检测方法耗时费力的问题，特别是针对金属板材表面和孔洞缺陷的自动化检测需求。

Method: 使用ConSinGAN生成大量金属板材图像数据，结合四个版本的YOLO模型（v3、v4、v7、v9）进行缺陷检测，并将最佳模型集成到制造硬件和SCADA系统中。

Result: YOLOv9模型结合ConSinGAN达到91.3%的准确率，检测时间为146毫秒，性能优于其他YOLO版本。

Conclusion: 提出的YOLOv9模型成功建立了实用的自动光学检测系统，且该方法可轻松应用于工业制造中的其他组件检测。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a YOLO-based deep learning (DL) model for automatic
defect detection to solve the time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks in
industrial manufacturing. In our experiments, the images of metal sheets are
used as the dataset for training the YOLO model to detect the defects on the
surfaces and in the holes of metal sheets. However, the lack of metal sheet
images significantly degrades the performance of detection accuracy. To address
this issue, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a considerable amount of data.
Four versions of the YOLO model (i.e., YOLOv3, v4, v7, and v9) are combined
with the ConSinGAN for data augmentation. The proposed YOLOv9 model with
ConSinGAN outperforms the other YOLO models with an accuracy of 91.3%, and a
detection time of 146 ms. The proposed YOLOv9 model is integrated into
manufacturing hardware and a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
system to establish a practical automated optical inspection (AOI) system.
Additionally, the proposed automated defect detection is easily applied to
other components in industrial manufacturing.

TL;DR: 提出OmniDFA框架，用于AI生成图像的开集少样本源模型识别，并构建了包含117万张图像的大规模数据集OmniFake。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI生成图像检测方法容易过拟合特定伪造特征，而源模型识别因缺乏大规模分类数据集而受限。

Method: 提出开集少样本源识别范式，开发OmniDFA框架进行图像真伪检测和少样本源模型识别，构建包含45个生成模型的OmniFake数据集。

Result: OmniDFA在开集识别方面表现出色，在AI生成图像检测上达到最先进的泛化性能。

Conclusion: OmniDFA框架和OmniFake数据集为AI生成图像检测和源识别提供了有效的解决方案和基础资源。

Abstract: AI-generated image (AIGI) detection and source model attribution remain
central challenges in combating deepfake abuses, primarily due to the
structural diversity of generative models. Current detection methods are prone
to overfitting specific forgery traits, whereas source attribution offers a
robust alternative through fine-grained feature discrimination. However,
synthetic image attribution remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale,
well-categorized synthetic datasets, limiting its practicality and
compatibility with detection systems. In this work, we propose a new paradigm
for image attribution called open-set, few-shot source identification. This
paradigm is designed to reliably identify unseen generators using only limited
samples, making it highly suitable for real-world application. To this end, we
introduce OmniDFA (Omni Detector and Few-shot Attributor), a novel framework
for AIGI that not only assesses the authenticity of images, but also determines
the synthesis origins in a few-shot manner. To facilitate this work, we
construct OmniFake, a large class-aware synthetic image dataset that curates
$1.17$ M images from $45$ distinct generative models, substantially enriching
the foundational resources for research on both AIGI detection and attribution.
Experiments demonstrate that OmniDFA exhibits excellent capability in open-set
attribution and achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on AIGI
detection. Our dataset and code will be made available.

*Xiping Li,Jianghong Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AIMCoT是一个主动信息驱动的多模态思维链框架，通过上下文增强注意力图生成、主动视觉探测和动态注意力转移触发机制，解决了现有方法在构建多模态思维链时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖简单的启发式方法构建多模态思维链，通常基于注意力图，但经验分析显示这些方法不可靠。其被动无目的的选择策略和任意触发机制在捕捉模型认知需求方面存在不足。

Method: 提出三个协同组件：1)上下文增强注意力图生成，缓解文本-视觉粒度不平衡；2)主动视觉探测，基于信息理论主动选择有助于最大程度回答问题的图像区域；3)动态注意力转移触发，通过监控模型文本到视觉的注意力转移来确定插入视觉信息的最佳时机。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的基准测试上的广泛实验表明，AIMCoT在不同设置下显著优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过主动获取信息和动态构建推理过程，AIMCoT代表了朝着更鲁棒、有效和类人化多模态推理的关键一步。

Abstract: Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has emerged as a powerful technique for
enhancing the vision-language reasoning with interleaved information. However,
existing methods often rely on simplistic heuristics for constructing
interleaved CoT, typically depending on attention maps, which our empirical
analysis reveals can be unreliable. What's more, the shortcomings of their
passive and purposeless selection strategies and their arbitrary triggering
mechanisms in capturing the model's cognitive need for information are further
amplified. In this paper, we propose \textbf{AIMCoT}, an \textbf{A}ctive
\textbf{I}nformation-driven \textbf{M}ulti-modal
\textbf{C}hain-\textbf{o}f-\textbf{T}hought framework that addresses these
fundamental limitations. AIMCoT introduces three synergistic components: (1)
\textbf{Context-enhanced Attention-map Generation (CAG)}, which mitigates the
text-vision granularity imbalance, thereby producing more reliable attention
maps as a foundation. (2) \textbf{Active Visual Probing (AVP)}, which replaces
passive selection with a proactive, goal-oriented strategy grounded in
information theory to select image regions that help answer the questions
maximally. (3) \textbf{Dynamic Attention-shifting Trigger (DAT)}, which
intelligently determines the optimal moments to insert visual information by
monitoring the model's text-to-vision attention shifts. Extensive experiments
on three challenging benchmarks demonstrate that AIMCoT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across different settings. By actively
foraging for information and dynamically structuring its reasoning process,
AIMCoT represents a critical step towards more robust, effective, and
human-like multimodal reasoning. Our code is available at

*Juyeop Kim,Songkuk Kim,Jong-Seok Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 扩散模型会记忆训练数据，这主要由早期去噪过程中的训练样本高估驱动，导致多样性减少、去噪轨迹坍缩，并加速向记忆图像收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管扩散模型在图像生成方面很成功，但它们会记忆训练数据，引发严重的隐私和版权问题。现有工作虽然试图描述、检测和缓解记忆现象，但记忆为何以及如何发生的基本问题仍未解决。

Method: 通过重新审视扩散和去噪过程，分析潜在空间动态，研究扩散模型如何记忆。具体包括分析训练损失、记忆提示对噪声预测的影响，以及分解中间潜在表示。

Result: 发现记忆不能仅用过拟合解释，因为训练损失在记忆情况下更大；记忆提示将训练图像注入噪声预测，迫使潜在轨迹收敛；中间潜在分解显示初始随机性被快速抑制并被记忆内容替代。

Conclusion: 早期高估是扩散模型中记忆现象的核心机制，偏离理论去噪计划与记忆严重程度高度相关。

Abstract: Despite their success in image generation, diffusion models can memorize
training data, raising serious privacy and copyright concerns. Although prior
work has sought to characterize, detect, and mitigate memorization, the
fundamental question of why and how it occurs remains unresolved. In this
paper, we revisit the diffusion and denoising process and analyze latent space
dynamics to address the question: "How do diffusion models memorize?" We show
that memorization is driven by the overestimation of training samples during
early denoising, which reduces diversity, collapses denoising trajectories, and
accelerates convergence toward the memorized image. Specifically: (i)
memorization cannot be explained by overfitting alone, as training loss is
larger under memorization due to classifier-free guidance amplifying
predictions and inducing overestimation; (ii) memorized prompts inject training
images into noise predictions, forcing latent trajectories to converge and
steering denoising toward their paired samples; and (iii) a decomposition of
intermediate latents reveals how initial randomness is quickly suppressed and
replaced by memorized content, with deviations from the theoretical denoising
schedule correlating almost perfectly with memorization severity. Together,
these results identify early overestimation as the central underlying mechanism
of memorization in diffusion models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProbMED是一个多模态医疗视觉语言预训练模型，采用概率对比学习来处理医疗数据中的多对多映射关系，在跨模态检索、零样本和少样本分类任务中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医疗视觉语言预训练模型无法直接处理医疗数据中常见的多对多映射关系，需要一种能够建模嵌入分布而非确定性估计的方法。

Method: 使用概率对比学习，将四种医疗模态（胸片、心电图、超声心动图和临床文本）对齐到统一的概率嵌入空间，采用InfoNCE损失和Hellinger距离整合模态间分布，并引入概率合成采样损失来改进模态内绑定。

Result: 在13个医疗数据集上的实验表明，该模型在跨模态检索、零样本和少样本分类任务中优于现有Med-VLPMs，并展示了多模态整合在预后预测中的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ProbMED通过概率建模有效解决了医疗数据中的多对多映射问题，显著提升了多模态医疗数据的表示学习性能。

Abstract: Medical decision-making requires integrating diverse medical information,
from imaging to clinical narratives. These medical modalities are often
acquired in a many-to-many manner. However, current medical vision-language
pretraining models (Med-VLPMs) fail to directly account for this many-to-many
mapping in their model training and embeddings. To address this, we present
Probabilistic Modality-Enhanced Diagnosis (ProbMED), a multimodal Med-VLPM that
employs probabilistic contrastive learning to model distributions over
embeddings rather than deterministic estimates. ProbMED aligns four distinct
modalities -- chest X-rays, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and clinical
text -- into a unified probabilistic embedding space. We use InfoNCE loss with
Hellinger distance to integrate inter-modality distributions. We introduce a
probabilistic synthetic sampling loss that captures modality-specific mean and
variance to improve intra-modality binding. Extensive experiments across 13
medical datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms current Med-VLPMs in
cross-modality retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification. We also
demonstrate the robust integration of multiple modalities for prognostication,
showing improved intra- and inter-medical modality binding.

TL;DR: MISP-DPO是一种多模态偏好优化框架，通过Plackett-Luce模型引入多个语义多样的负样本图像，解决了现有方法依赖简单成对比较的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖过度简化的成对比较，通过基本扰动或基于相似性的检索生成单个负图像，无法捕捉多模态偏好的复杂性，导致优化偏差和幻觉问题。

Method: 在CLIP空间中嵌入提示和候选图像，应用稀疏自编码器揭示可解释的语义偏差因子。基于重构难度、与正样本的语义偏差和相互多样性选择负样本，采用Plackett-Luce目标和重要性采样策略。

Result: 在五个不同基准测试上的实验表明，MISP-DPO在多模态对齐方面持续优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 验证了语义感知的多负采样在基于偏好的学习中的有效性。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently been extended from
text-only models to vision-language models. However, existing methods rely on
oversimplified pairwise comparisons, generating a single negative image via
basic perturbations or similarity-based retrieval, which fail to capture the
complex nature of multimodal preferences, inducing optimization bias and
hallucinations. To address this issue, we propose MISP-DPO, the first framework
to incorporate multiple, semantically diverse negative images in multimodal DPO
via the Plackett-Luce model. Our method embeds prompts and candidate images in
CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) space and applies a sparse
autoencoder to uncover semantic deviations into interpretable factors. Negative
samples are selected based on reconstruction difficulty, semantic deviation
from the positive, and mutual diversity, yielding broader and more informative
supervision. To handle multi-negative comparisons, we adopt a Plackett-Luce
objective and introduce an importance sampling strategy that improves training
efficiency. Experiments across five diverse benchmarks demonstrate that
MISP-DPO consistently improves multimodal alignment over prior methods,
validating the effectiveness of semantic-aware, multi-negative sampling in
preference-based learning.

Result: 在八个基准测试中达到SOTA性能，在SPED、Pitts30k-test、MSLS-val和Nordland上分别获得98.9%、95.8%、94.5%和96.0%的Recall@1，在SPED上仅使用4096D全局描述符就实现了100%的Recall@10。

Conclusion: SAGE通过动态整合空间和视觉信息，显著提升了视觉地点识别的性能，证明了空间-视觉自适应图探索的有效性。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) requires robust retrieval of geotagged images
despite large appearance, viewpoint, and environmental variation. Prior methods
focus on descriptor fine-tuning or fixed sampling strategies yet neglect the
dynamic interplay between spatial context and visual similarity during
training. We present SAGE (Spatial-visual Adaptive Graph Exploration), a
unified training pipeline that enhances granular spatial-visual discrimination
by jointly improving local feature aggregation, organize samples during
training, and hard sample mining. We introduce a lightweight Soft Probing
module that learns residual weights from training data for patch descriptors
before bilinear aggregation, boosting distinctive local cues. During training
we reconstruct an online geo-visual graph that fuses geographic proximity and
current visual similarity so that candidate neighborhoods reflect the evolving
embedding landscape. To concentrate learning on the most informative place
neighborhoods, we seed clusters from high-affinity anchors and iteratively
expand them with a greedy weighted clique expansion sampler. Implemented with a
frozen DINOv2 backbone and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, SAGE achieves SOTA
across eight benchmarks. It attains 98.9%, 95.8%, 94.5%, and 96.0% Recall@1 on
SPED, Pitts30k-test, MSLS-val, and Nordland, respectively. Notably, our method
obtains 100% Recall@10 on SPED only using 4096D global descriptors. Code and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaTo是一个基于地标标记化的扩散变换器，用于细粒度、身份保持的人脸编辑。它通过将原始地标坐标量化为离散面部标记，结合位置映射位置编码，以及使用视觉语言模型预测目标地标，实现了更好的身份保持和语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态人脸编辑方法在精确属性控制和身份保持方面存在困难。传统方法将面部地标作为刚性几何约束，当条件地标与源图像偏差较大时（如大表情或姿态变化、不准确的地标估计）会降低身份保持效果。

Method: 提出LaTo方法，包括：(1) 地标标记器将原始地标坐标直接量化为离散面部标记；(2) 位置映射位置编码整合面部和图像标记进行统一处理；(3) 利用视觉语言模型从指令和源图像推断目标地标的地标预测器。

Result: 在广泛的实验中，LaTo在身份保持方面比最先进方法提高了7.8%，在语义一致性方面提高了4.6%。

Conclusion: LaTo通过地标标记化和创新的位置编码方法，有效解决了人脸编辑中的身份保持和精确控制问题，在保持身份和语义一致性方面显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent multimodal models for instruction-based face editing enable semantic
manipulation but still struggle with precise attribute control and identity
preservation. Structural facial representations such as landmarks are effective
for intermediate supervision, yet most existing methods treat them as rigid
geometric constraints, which can degrade identity when conditional landmarks
deviate significantly from the source (e.g., large expression or pose changes,
inaccurate landmark estimates). To address these limitations, we propose LaTo,
a landmark-tokenized diffusion transformer for fine-grained,
identity-preserving face editing. Our key innovations include: (1) a landmark
tokenizer that directly quantizes raw landmark coordinates into discrete facial
tokens, obviating the need for dense pixel-wise correspondence; (2) a
location-mapping positional encoding that integrates facial and image tokens
for unified processing, enabling flexible yet decoupled geometry-appearance
interactions with high efficiency and strong identity preservation; and (3) a
landmark predictor that leverages vision-language models to infer target
landmarks from instructions and source images, whose structured
chain-of-thought improves estimation accuracy and interactive control. To
mitigate data scarcity, we curate HFL-150K, to our knowledge the largest
benchmark for this task, containing over 150K real face pairs with fine-grained
instructions. Extensive experiments show that LaTo outperforms state-of-the-art
methods by 7.8% in identity preservation and 4.6% in semantic consistency. Code
and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) aims to track and segment specific objects
across entire video sequences, yet it remains highly challenging under complex
real-world scenarios. The MOSEv1 and LVOS dataset, adopted in the MOSEv1
challenge on LSVOS 2025, which is specifically designed to enhance the
robustness of VOS models in complex real-world scenarios, including long-term
object disappearances and reappearances, as well as the presence of small and

Confidence-Guided Fusion Segmentation (CGFSeg), for the VOS task in the MOSEv1
Challenge. During training, the feature extractor of SAM2 is frozen, while the
remaining components are fine-tuned to preserve strong feature extraction
ability and improve segmentation accuracy. In the inference stage, we introduce
a pixel-check strategy that progressively refines predictions by exploiting
complementary strengths of multiple models, thereby yielding robust final
masks. As a result, our method achieves a J&F score of 86.37% on the test set,
ranking 1st in the MOSEv1 Challenge at LSVOS 2025. These results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges of VOS task in

Motivation: 现有的人体网格恢复方法大多输出单一确定性结果，无法有效建模从2D观测到3D姿态的固有模糊性。概率方法虽然尝试生成多个可能输出，但在准确性和样本多样性之间存在权衡。

Method: 使用SO(3)扩散模型生成以3D旋转表示的姿态参数分布，通过条件丢弃实现无条件和图像条件生成。利用transformer学习人体关节的层次结构，用小MLP去噪模型学习基于潜在向量的每关节分布。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效预测准确的姿态概率分布，解决了准确性与多样性之间的权衡问题。

Conclusion: 提出的SO(3)扩散模型方法能够有效建模人体姿态恢复中的模糊性，生成与2D观测良好对齐的分布，在准确性和多样性方面都表现出色。

Abstract: We tackle the problem of Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from a single RGB image,
formulating it as an image-conditioned human pose and shape generation. While
recovering 3D human pose from 2D observations is inherently ambiguous, most
existing approaches have regressed a single deterministic output. Probabilistic
methods attempt to address this by generating multiple plausible outputs to
model the ambiguity. However, these methods often exhibit a trade-off between
accuracy and sample diversity, and their single predictions are not competitive
with state-of-the-art deterministic models. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a novel approach that models well-aligned distribution to 2D
observations. In particular, we introduce $SO(3)$ diffusion model, which
generates the distribution of pose parameters represented as 3D rotations
unconditional and conditional to image observations via conditioning dropout.
Our model learns the hierarchical structure of human body joints using the
transformer. Instead of using transformer as a denoising model, the
time-independent transformer extracts latent vectors for the joints and a small
MLP-based denoising model learns the per-joint distribution conditioned on the
latent vector. We experimentally demonstrate and analyze that our model
predicts accurate pose probability distribution effectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于拖拽的图像编辑方法主要在2D像素平面上操作，缺乏3D几何线索，导致在旋转和透视变换等几何密集型场景中产生不精确和不一致的编辑结果。

Method: 提出统一的位移场，联合编码3D几何和2D空间先验；采用无冲突分区策略隔离编辑区域，防止干扰并确保一致性；在单次前向传播中实现连贯编辑。

Result: 在各种编辑场景下的广泛实验验证了方法的有效性，显示出卓越的精度、结构一致性和可靠的多点编辑能力。

Conclusion: GeoDrag通过整合3D几何信息，显著提升了基于拖拽的图像编辑在几何密集型任务中的精确性和一致性，为交互式图像编辑提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Interactive point-based image editing serves as a controllable editor,
enabling precise and flexible manipulation of image content. However, most
drag-based methods operate primarily on the 2D pixel plane with limited use of
3D cues. As a result, they often produce imprecise and inconsistent edits,
particularly in geometry-intensive scenarios such as rotations and perspective
transformations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
geometry-guided drag-based image editing method - GeoDrag, which addresses
three key challenges: 1) incorporating 3D geometric cues into pixel-level
editing, 2) mitigating discontinuities caused by geometry-only guidance, and 3)
resolving conflicts arising from multi-point dragging. Built upon a unified
displacement field that jointly encodes 3D geometry and 2D spatial priors,
GeoDrag enables coherent, high-fidelity, and structure-consistent editing in a
single forward pass. In addition, a conflict-free partitioning strategy is
introduced to isolate editing regions, effectively preventing interference and
ensuring consistency. Extensive experiments across various editing scenarios
validate the effectiveness of our method, showing superior precision,
structural consistency, and reliable multi-point editability. The code will be
available on https://github.com/xinyu-pu/GeoDrag .

TL;DR: IPDRecon是一个基于图像平面解码的室内场景重建框架，通过利用单视图内的空间信息而非多视图几何约束，显著提升了在视图数量减少时的重建稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于体素的室内场景重建方法严重依赖多视图像素反投影射线交点作为几何约束，导致重建质量对输入视图密度高度敏感，在重叠区域和未观测区域表现不佳。

Method: 提出IPDRecon框架，包含三个核心组件：像素级置信度编码器(PCE)、仿射补偿模块(ACM)和图像平面空间解码器(IPSD)，通过物理成像过程解码2D图像中编码的3D结构信息。

Result: 在ScanNetV2上的实验表明，IPDRecon在视图数量减少40%时仍能保持几乎相同的重建质量，变异系数仅为0.24%，性能保持率达到99.7%，最大性能下降仅为0.42%。

Conclusion: 利用视图内空间信息为实际应用中视图受限场景提供了鲁棒的解决方案，显著提升了重建的视图不变性。

Abstract: Volume-based indoor scene reconstruction methods demonstrate significant
research value due to their superior generalization capability and real-time
deployment potential. However, existing methods rely on multi-view pixel
back-projection ray intersections as weak geometric constraints to determine
spatial positions, causing reconstruction quality to depend heavily on input
view density with poor performance in overlapping regions and unobserved areas.
To address these issues, the key lies in reducing dependency on inter-view
geometric constraints while exploiting rich spatial information within
individual views. We propose IPDRecon, an image-plane decoding framework
comprising three core components: Pixel-level Confidence Encoder (PCE), Affine
Compensation Module (ACM), and Image-Plane Spatial Decoder (IPSD). These
modules collaboratively decode 3D structural information encoded in 2D images
through physical imaging processes, effectively preserving spatial geometric
features including edges, hollow structures, and complex textures while
significantly enhancing view-invariant reconstruction. Experiments on ScanNetV2
confirm that IPDRecon achieves superior reconstruction stability, maintaining
nearly identical quality when view count reduces by 40%. The method achieves a
coefficient of variation of only 0.24%, performance retention rate of 99.7%,
and maximum performance drop of merely 0.42%. This demonstrates that exploiting
intra-view spatial information provides a robust solution for view-limited
scenarios in practical applications.

Conclusion: 建立了金融短视频字幕生成的第一个基准，展示了视频模态在捕捉视觉上下文和有效线索方面的重要价值，同时揭示了多模态组合的优化策略。

Abstract: We evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for topic-aligned
captioning in financial short-form videos (SVs) by testing joint reasoning over
transcripts (T), audio (A), and video (V). Using 624 annotated YouTube SVs, we
assess all seven modality combinations (T, A, V, TA, TV, AV, TAV) across five
topics: main recommendation, sentiment analysis, video purpose, visual
analysis, and financial entity recognition. Video alone performs strongly on
four of five topics, underscoring its value for capturing visual context and
effective cues such as emotions, gestures, and body language. Selective pairs
such as TV or AV often surpass TAV, implying that too many modalities may
introduce noise. These results establish the first baselines for financial
short-form video captioning and illustrate the potential and challenges of
grounding complex visual cues in this domain. All code and data can be found on

Abstract: Ultrasound is crucial in modern medicine but faces challenges like operator
dependence, image noise, and real-time scanning, hindering AI integration.
While large multimodal models excel in other medical imaging areas, they
struggle with ultrasound's complexities. To address this, we introduce Dolphin
v1.0 (V1) and its reasoning-augmented version, Dolphin R1-the first large-scale
multimodal ultrasound foundation models unifying diverse clinical tasks in a
single vision-language framework.To tackle ultrasound variability and noise, we
curated a 2-million-scale multimodal dataset, combining textbook knowledge,
public data, synthetic samples, and general corpora. This ensures robust
perception, generalization, and clinical adaptability.The Dolphin series
employs a three-stage training strategy: domain-specialized pretraining,
instruction-driven alignment, and reinforcement-based refinement. Dolphin v1.0
delivers reliable performance in classification, detection, regression, and
report generation. Dolphin R1 enhances diagnostic inference, reasoning
transparency, and interpretability through reinforcement learning with
ultrasound-specific rewards.Evaluated on U2-Bench across eight ultrasound
tasks, Dolphin R1 achieves a U2-score of 0.5835-over twice the second-best
model (0.2968) setting a new state of the art. Dolphin v1.0 also performs
competitively, validating the unified framework. Comparisons show
reasoning-enhanced training significantly improves diagnostic accuracy,
consistency, and interpretability, highlighting its importance for high-stakes
medical AI.

*Junseo Park,Hyeryung Jang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ART-VITON是一个基于测量引导的扩散框架，用于虚拟试穿任务，通过渐进式测量一致性来消除边界伪影并保持非试穿区域的完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的虚拟试穿方法在使用潜在扩散模型时，难以有效保持非试穿区域（如身份和背景）的完整性，直接替换策略会导致边界伪影问题。

Method: 将虚拟试穿重新表述为线性逆问题，采用轨迹对齐求解器，结合残差先验初始化和无伪影测量引导采样，包括数据一致性、频率级校正和周期性标准去噪。

Result: 在VITON-HD、DressCode和SHHQ-1.0数据集上的实验表明，ART-VITON能有效保持身份和背景，消除边界伪影，在视觉保真度和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ART-VITON通过测量引导的扩散框架成功解决了虚拟试穿中的边界伪影问题，实现了更好的非试穿区域保持效果。

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VITON) aims to generate realistic images of a person wearing
a target garment, requiring precise garment alignment in try-on regions and
faithful preservation of identity and background in non-try-on regions. While
latent diffusion models (LDMs) have advanced alignment and detail synthesis,
preserving non-try-on regions remains challenging. A common post-hoc strategy
directly replaces these regions with original content, but abrupt transitions
often produce boundary artifacts. To overcome this, we reformulate VITON as a
linear inverse problem and adopt trajectory-aligned solvers that progressively
enforce measurement consistency, reducing abrupt changes in non-try-on regions.
However, existing solvers still suffer from semantic drift during generation,
leading to artifacts. We propose ART-VITON, a measurement-guided diffusion
framework that ensures measurement adherence while maintaining artifact-free
synthesis. Our method integrates residual prior-based initialization to
mitigate training-inference mismatch and artifact-free measurement-guided
sampling that combines data consistency, frequency-level correction, and
periodic standard denoising. Experiments on VITON-HD, DressCode, and SHHQ-1.0
demonstrate that ART-VITON effectively preserves identity and background,
eliminates boundary artifacts, and consistently improves visual fidelity and
robustness over state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了文本偏好优化（TPO）框架，无需配对图像偏好数据即可实现文本到图像模型的“免费午餐”对齐，通过训练模型偏好匹配提示而非不匹配提示来提升文本-图像对齐质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于人类反馈的强化学习方法依赖昂贵的配对图像偏好数据或学习奖励函数，面临可扩展性限制，需要一种更经济高效的文本-图像对齐方法。

Method: 使用大语言模型扰动原始标题构建不匹配提示，训练模型偏好匹配提示而非不匹配提示，将DPO和KTO算法扩展到文本偏好优化设置中。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，TPO方法在人类偏好评分和文本-图像对齐方面始终优于原始方法，实现了更好的对齐效果。

Conclusion: TPO框架提供了一种无需配对图像偏好数据的有效对齐方法，为文本到图像模型的对齐问题提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models have led to
remarkable success in generating high-quality images from textual prompts.
However, ensuring accurate alignment between the text and the generated image
remains a significant challenge for state-of-the-art diffusion models. To
address this, existing studies employ reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) to align T2I outputs with human preferences. These methods,
however, either rely directly on paired image preference data or require a
learned reward function, both of which depend heavily on costly, high-quality
human annotations and thus face scalability limitations. In this work, we
introduce Text Preference Optimization (TPO), a framework that enables
"free-lunch" alignment of T2I models, achieving alignment without the need for
paired image preference data. TPO works by training the model to prefer matched
prompts over mismatched prompts, which are constructed by perturbing original
captions using a large language model. Our framework is general and compatible
with existing preference-based algorithms. We extend both DPO and KTO to our
setting, resulting in TDPO and TKTO. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
across multiple benchmarks show that our methods consistently outperform their
original counterparts, delivering better human preference scores and improved
text-to-image alignment. Our Open-source code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了v-HUB视觉幽默理解基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型仅通过视觉线索理解幽默的能力，发现当前模型在这方面存在困难，而音频的加入能提升理解效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估和诊断多模态大语言模型理解幽默的能力，特别是在仅通过视觉线索的场景下，这对提升人机交互的参与度具有重要意义。

Method: 构建v-HUB基准，包含来自经典默片和在线资源的非语言短视频，配有丰富注释（字幕、描述、解释），支持字幕匹配和幽默解释等评估任务，并构建开放式视频问答任务。

Result: 实验结果显示，所有模型在仅基于视频（无音频）的评估中都表现出明显的性能下降，表明MLLMs仅通过视觉线索理解幽默存在困难。加入音频有助于提升幽默理解效果。

Conclusion: 当前多模态大语言模型在仅通过视觉线索理解幽默方面存在挑战，音频信息对幽默理解有积极作用，表明整合更丰富的模态对复杂视频理解任务具有潜力。

Abstract: AI models capable of comprehending humor hold real-world promise -- for
example, enhancing engagement in human-machine interactions. To gauge and
diagnose the capacity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for humor
understanding, we introduce v-HUB, a novel visual-centric video humor
understanding benchmark. v-HUB comprises a curated collection of minimally
verbal short videos, sourced from classic silent films and online resources,
and reflecting real-world scenarios where humor can be appreciated purely
through visual cues. Each video clip is paired with rich annotations, including
captions, descriptions, and explanations, supporting evaluation tasks like
caption matching and humor explanation. To broaden its applicability, we
further construct an open-ended video QA task, making it readily integrable
into existing video understanding benchmarks. We evaluate a diverse set of
MLLMs, from specialized Video-LLMs to versatile OmniLLMs that can process
audio, covering both open-source and proprietary domains. The experimental
results expose the difficulties MLLMs face in comprehending humor from visual
cues alone. For example, all models exhibit a marked performance drop on
caption matching when moving from text-based to video-based evaluation (without
audio). Our findings also demonstrate that incorporating audio helps with video
humor understanding, highlighting the informativeness of sound and the promise
of integrating richer modalities for complex video understanding tasks.

*Jeongjae Lee,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PCPO框架来解决文本到图像模型强化学习中的训练不稳定问题，通过比例信用分配加速收敛并提升图像质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有策略梯度方法存在训练不稳定和高方差问题，阻碍收敛速度并影响图像质量，主要原因是生成采样器的数学结构导致跨时间步的不稳定和非比例反馈

Method: 引入比例信用策略优化(PCPO)框架，通过稳定的目标重构和原则性的时间步重加权来强制执行比例信用分配

Result: PCPO显著稳定了训练过程，加速收敛并提升图像质量，有效缓解模型崩溃问题，在所有方面都优于现有策略梯度基线包括最先进的DanceGRPO

Conclusion: PCPO通过解决信用分配问题，为文本到图像模型的强化学习对齐提供了更稳定高效的训练方法

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the alignment of text-to-image
(T2I) models, state-of-the-art policy gradient methods are still hampered by
training instability and high variance, hindering convergence speed and
compromising image quality. Our analysis identifies a key cause of this
instability: disproportionate credit assignment, in which the mathematical
structure of the generative sampler produces volatile and non-proportional
feedback across timesteps. To address this, we introduce Proportionate Credit
Policy Optimization (PCPO), a framework that enforces proportional credit
assignment through a stable objective reformulation and a principled
reweighting of timesteps. This correction stabilizes the training process,
leading to significantly accelerated convergence and superior image quality.
The improvement in quality is a direct result of mitigating model collapse, a
common failure mode in recursive training. PCPO substantially outperforms
existing policy gradient baselines on all fronts, including the
state-of-the-art DanceGRPO.

*Mingyu Kang,Yong Suk Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ENM Inversion的新反演技术，通过搜索最优噪声图来同时保证内容保持和可编辑性，解决了现有文本引导图像编辑方法在遵循目标文本提示方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在文本引导图像编辑中面临挑战，虽然反演噪声图能够忠实重建源图像，但限制了所需编辑的灵活性，难以紧密遵循目标文本提示。

Method: 分析增强可编辑性的噪声图特性，引入可编辑噪声精炼，通过最小化重建和编辑噪声图之间的差异来与期望编辑对齐。

Result: 大量实验表明ENM Inversion在多种图像编辑任务中，在内容保持和编辑保真度方面均优于现有方法，并能轻松应用于视频编辑。

Conclusion: ENM Inversion是一种有效的反演技术，能够同时实现内容保持和高质量编辑，为文本引导的图像和视频编辑提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating
high-quality and diverse images. Building on these advancements, diffusion
models have also demonstrated exceptional performance in text-guided image
editing. A key strategy for effective image editing involves inverting the
source image into editable noise maps associated with the target image.
However, previous inversion methods face challenges in adhering closely to the
target text prompt. The limitation arises because inverted noise maps, while
enabling faithful reconstruction of the source image, restrict the flexibility
needed for desired edits. To overcome this issue, we propose Editable Noise Map
Inversion (ENM Inversion), a novel inversion technique that searches for
optimal noise maps to ensure both content preservation and editability. We
analyze the properties of noise maps for enhanced editability. Based on this
analysis, our method introduces an editable noise refinement that aligns with
the desired edits by minimizing the difference between the reconstructed and
edited noise maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ENM Inversion
outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of image editing tasks in
both preservation and edit fidelity with target prompts. Our approach can also
be easily applied to video editing, enabling temporal consistency and content
manipulation across frames.

TL;DR: EvoQuality是一种无需人工标注的自监督框架，通过自我一致性原则和群体相对策略优化，让视觉语言模型在图像质量评估任务中自主提升感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型后训练方法依赖昂贵的人工标注数据，而自监督方法在感知领域如图像质量评估中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用自我一致性原则生成伪标签，通过成对多数投票建立相对质量共识，然后使用群体相对策略优化进行迭代进化。

Result: 在多个IQA基准测试中，EvoQuality将基础模型的零样本性能提升了31.8%（PLCC），在7个基准中的5个上超越了有监督的VLM模型。

Conclusion: EvoQuality证明无需人工标注的自监督方法也能在图像质量评估任务中达到甚至超越有监督方法的性能。

Abstract: Improving vision-language models (VLMs) in the post-training stage typically
relies on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, methods that
necessitate costly, human-annotated data. While self-supervised techniques such
as self-consistency have proven effective for enhancing reasoning capabilities,
their application to perceptual domains such as image quality assessment (IQA)
remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce EvoQuality, a novel
framework that enables a VLM to autonomously refine its quality perception
capabilities without any ground-truth labels. EvoQuality adapts the principle
of self-consistency to the ranking-based nature of IQA. It generates
pseudo-labels by performing pairwise majority voting on the VLM's own outputs
to establish a consensus on relative quality. These pseudo-rankings are then
formulated into a fidelity reward that guides the model's iterative evolution
through group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By iteratively leveraging
its own predictions, EvoQuality progressively refines the VLM's perceptual
capability. Extensive experiments show that EvoQuality boosts the base VLM's
zero-shot performance by 31.8\% on PLCC across diverse IQA benchmarks.
Remarkably, despite being entirely self-supervised, EvoQuality achieves
performance that is competitive with, or even surpasses, state-of-the-art
supervised VLM-based IQA models, outperforming these models on 5 out of 7 IQA
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoingECG是一个概率学生-教师模型，利用不确定性感知的ECG嵌入和ECHO监督来改进基于ECG的心脏功能预测，在零样本、少样本和微调设置中优于现有ECG基础模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心电图(ECG)成本低且易于获取，而超声心动图(ECHO)虽然对临床心脏评估至关重要但需要大量医院资源。研究旨在利用ECG预测传统上需要更复杂模式(如ECHO)才能获得的关键结果。

Method: 提出EchoingECG概率学生-教师模型，整合概率跨模态嵌入(PCME++)和基于ECHO-文本对训练的视觉语言预训练模型(ECHO-CLIP)，将ECHO知识蒸馏到ECG表示中。

Result: 实验和外部验证表明，EchoingECG在基于ECG的ECHO预测任务中，在零样本、少样本和微调设置下均优于最先进的ECG基础模型。方差估计有助于识别ECG中的不确定性区域。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将ECHO知识蒸馏到ECG表示中，提高了ECG在心脏功能预测中的性能，同时通过不确定性估计增强了模型性能的理解。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used tool for assessing cardiac function
due to its low cost and accessibility. Emergent research shows that ECGs can
help make predictions on key outcomes traditionally derived from more complex
modalities such as echocardiograms (ECHO), enabling the use of ECGs as a more
accessible method to predict broader measurements of cardiac function. ECHO, in
particular, are of great importance because they require considerable hospital
resources while playing a key role in clinical cardiac assessment. To aid this
use case, we introduce EchoingECG, a probabilistic student-teacher model that
leverages uncertainty-aware ECG embeddings and ECHO supervision to improve
ECG-based cardiac function prediction. Our approach integrates Probabilistic
Cross-Modal Embeddings (PCME++), a probabilistic contrastive framework, with
ECHO-CLIP, a vision-language pre-trained model trained on ECHO-text pairs, to
distill ECHO knowledge into ECG representations. Through experiments and
external validation, we showed that EchoingECG outperforms state-of-the-art
foundation ECG models in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tune settings for ECHO
predictions based on ECG. We also highlighted that variance estimation (enabled
through our method) enhanced our understanding of model performance by
identifying underlying regions of uncertainty within ECGs. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要通过基于图像标注的多选题评估VLMs的具身推理能力，缺乏对精确视觉定位能力的系统评估。

Method: 设计分层评估协议：S1-指称对象定位、S2-任务驱动指向、S3-视觉轨迹预测，数据来自室内、厨房、驾驶和机器人操作等关键领域。

Result: 对10多个最先进VLM的实验发现：GPT-4o等通用模型在精确视觉定位上表现不如某些开源模型；MoLMO在S1和S2表现良好但在S3（需要视觉轨迹规划）表现不佳。

Conclusion: PIO基准揭示了当前VLMs在精确视觉定位和具身推理方面的局限性，为模型改进提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive world knowledge
across a wide range of tasks, making them promising candidates for embodied
reasoning applications. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate the
embodied reasoning ability of VLMs through multiple-choice questions based on
image annotations -- for example, selecting which trajectory better describes
an event in the image. In this work, we introduce the Point-It-Out (PIO)
benchmark, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess the embodied
reasoning abilities of VLMs through precise visual grounding. We propose a
hierarchical evaluation protocol spanning three stages (S1: referred-object
localization, S2: task-driven pointing, and S3: visual trace prediction), with
data collected from critical domains for embodied intelligence, including
indoor, kitchen, driving, and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive
experiments with over ten state-of-the-art VLMs reveal several interesting
findings. For example, strong general-purpose models such as GPT-4o, while
excelling on many benchmarks (e.g., language, perception, and reasoning),
underperform compared to some open-source models in precise visual grounding;
models such as MoLMO perform well in S1 and S2 but struggle in S3, where
requires grounding combined with visual trace planning.

Method: 通过动态相似性图构建（使用可学习多项式衰减初始化权重排序机制）和自适应局部特征聚合，结合LoRA构建互补优化框架。

Result: 在鹰嘴豆荚数据集上，DSGA+LoRA在2、4、8、10样本设置下均表现优异，结构度量提升17.31%，自适应F度量提升62.36%，参数量仅为原始SAM的4.26%。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂田间条件下实现了准确的豆荚计数（调整R平方0.8987），为自动化农业监测提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of foundation models for agricultural
computer vision tasks remains challenging due to limited training data and
complex field conditions. This study introduces a Dynamic Similarity-based
Graph Adaptation (DSGA) module to adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) under
extreme data constraints for precise foreground and instance segmentation of
small dense objects in complex agricultural environments. Through dynamic
similarity graph construction with a learnable polynomial decay-initialized
weight ranking mechanism and adaptive local feature aggregation, DSGA
establishes robust spatial and dynamic similarity representation with only
4.00M trainable parameters, which is 4.26% of the original SAM. Integrating
this graph-based feature adaptation with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) creates a
complementary optimization framework that effectively captures both local and
global dependencies in image embeddings while preserving model stability and
parameter efficiency. Experimental results on a challenging chickpea pod
dataset demonstrated that DSGA with LoRA achieved superior performance across
multiple metrics evaluated under 2, 4, 8 and 10 shots, with progressive
performance gains as shot count increased. Quantitative metrics showed a 17.31%
improvement in Structure-measure and a 62.36% gain in adaptive F-measure
compared to the baseline SAM fine-tuning. Comprehensive ablation studies and
visualization analyses through Grad-CAM and t-SNE validated the framework's
effectiveness in feature discrimination. The proposed adaptation demonstrated
practical utility for automated agricultural monitoring applications, achieving
accurate pod-counting with an adjusted R-squared of 0.8987 for images with 10
to 120 pods under challenging field conditions.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been
primarily evaluated on general-purpose benchmarks, while their applications in
domain-specific scenarios, such as intelligent product moderation, remain
underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce an open-world logo recognition
benchmark, a core challenge in product moderation. Unlike traditional logo
recognition methods that rely on memorizing representations of tens of
thousands of brands-an impractical approach in real-world settings-our proposed
method, Logo-VGR, enables generalization to large-scale brand recognition with
supervision from only a small subset of brands. Specifically, we reformulate
logo recognition as a comparison-based task, requiring the model to match
product images with candidate logos rather than directly generating brand
labels. We further observe that existing models tend to overfit by memorizing
brand distributions instead of learning robust multimodal reasoning, which
results in poor performance on unseen brands. To overcome this limitation,
Logo-VGR introduces a new paradigm of domain-specific multimodal reasoning:
Logo Perception Grounding injects domain knowledge, and Logo-Guided Visual
Grounded Reasoning enhances the model's reasoning capability. Experimental
results show that Logo-VGR outperforms strong baselines by nearly 10 points in
OOD settings, demonstrating superior generalization.

Abstract: Understanding the spatio-temporal distribution of species is a cornerstone of
ecology and conservation. By pairing species observations with geographic and
environmental predictors, researchers can model the relationship between an
environment and the species which may be found there. To advance the
state-of-the-art in this area with deep learning models and remote sensing
data, we organized an open machine learning challenge called GeoLifeCLEF 2023.
The training dataset comprised 5 million plant species observations (single
positive label per sample) distributed across Europe and covering most of its
flora, high-resolution rasters: remote sensing imagery, land cover, elevation,
in addition to coarse-resolution data: climate, soil and human footprint
variables. In this multi-label classification task, we evaluated models ability
to predict the species composition in 22 thousand small plots based on
standardized surveys. This paper presents an overview of the competition,
synthesizes the approaches used by the participating teams, and analyzes the
main results. In particular, we highlight the biases faced by the methods
fitted to single positive labels when it comes to the multi-label evaluation,
and the new and effective learning strategy combining single and multi-label
data in training.

Abstract: In this study, we focus on the automatic evaluation of long and detailed
image captions generated by multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Most
existing automatic evaluation metrics for image captioning are primarily
designed for short captions and are not suitable for evaluating long captions.
Moreover, recent LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from slow inference due to
their reliance on autoregressive inference and early fusion of visual
information. To address these limitations, we propose VELA, an automatic
evaluation metric for long captions developed within a novel
LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge framework. Furthermore, we propose LongCap-Arena, a
benchmark specifically designed for evaluating metrics for long captions. This
benchmark comprises 7,805 images, the corresponding human-provided long
reference captions and long candidate captions, and 32,246 human judgments from
three distinct perspectives: Descriptiveness, Relevance, and Fluency. We
demonstrated that VELA outperformed existing metrics and achieved superhuman
performance on LongCap-Arena.

*Jinho Chang,Jaemin Kim,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练、基于奖励引导的图像编辑框架，将编辑过程建模为轨迹最优控制问题，在保持源图像语义内容的同时增强目标奖励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于奖励引导的方法主要关注图像生成，而如何将其应用于需要保持源图像语义内容的图像编辑任务仍未被充分探索。

Method: 将扩散模型的反向过程视为从源图像出发的可控轨迹，通过迭代更新伴随状态来引导编辑过程，将其建模为轨迹最优控制问题。

Result: 在多种编辑任务上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有的基于反转的无训练引导基线，在奖励最大化和源图像保真度之间实现了更好的平衡，且避免了奖励破解问题。

Conclusion: 该框架为奖励引导的图像编辑提供了一种有效的无需训练解决方案，能够在不牺牲源图像内容的前提下优化目标奖励。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion and flow-matching models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in high-fidelity image synthesis. A prominent line of
research involves reward-guided guidance, which steers the generation process
during inference to align with specific objectives. However, leveraging this
reward-guided approach to the task of image editing, which requires preserving
the semantic content of the source image while enhancing a target reward, is
largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for
training-free, reward-guided image editing. We formulate the editing process as
a trajectory optimal control problem where the reverse process of a diffusion
model is treated as a controllable trajectory originating from the source
image, and the adjoint states are iteratively updated to steer the editing
process. Through extensive experiments across distinct editing tasks, we
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
inversion-based training-free guidance baselines, achieving a superior balance
between reward maximization and fidelity to the source image without reward
hacking.

TL;DR: 本文揭示了多模态推理的双重性：虽然能增强逻辑推理能力，但会逐渐损害感知基础，导致视觉遗忘现象。作者提出Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO)方法，通过显式引导推理过程朝向视觉基础轨迹来解决这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将推理能力扩展到视觉语言模型(VLMs)取得了进展，但发现多模态推理存在双重性：在增强逻辑推理的同时会逐渐损害感知基础，导致基本视觉问题的识别失败。

Method: 提出Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO)方法，这是一种简单有效的技术，显式地将推理过程引导至视觉基础轨迹，以解决视觉遗忘问题。

Result: VAPO-Thinker-7B模型显著增强了模型对视觉信息的依赖，并在多个基准测试中取得了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: VAPO方法有效解决了多模态推理中的视觉遗忘问题，通过强化视觉基础显著提升了模型性能，为多模态推理系统提供了重要改进方向。

Abstract: Reasoning has emerged as a pivotal capability in Large Language Models
(LLMs). Through Reinforcement Learning (RL), typically Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), these models are able to solve complex tasks such as
mathematics and code generation. Building on these advances, recent research
has sought to extend reasoning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yielding
promising results across diverse visual tasks. Despite this progress, our study
uncovers the dual nature of multimodal reasoning: while it substantially
enhances logical inference and facilitates performance on challenging problems,
it may gradually impair perceptual grounding, leading to recognition failures
on otherwise basic visual questions. Through further analysis, we attribute
this phenomenon to visual forgetting, wherein prolonged reasoning causes the
model to increasingly disregard visual input. To address this, we propose
Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a simple yet effective method that
explicitly steers the reasoning process toward visually grounded trajectories.
Our result model, VAPO-Thinker-7B, significantly strengthens the model's
reliance on visual information and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a
wide range of established benchmarks. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态符号逻辑推理在自动驾驶、医疗诊断等高风险应用中至关重要，需要严谨的确定性推理来避免严重后果。目前缺乏评估多模态模型符号逻辑推理能力的基准。

Method: 构建MuSLR基准数据集，包含7个领域的1093个实例，涵盖35种原子符号逻辑和976个逻辑组合，推理深度2-9。提出LogiCAM模块化框架，将形式逻辑规则应用于多模态输入。

Result: 评估7个最先进的多模态模型，发现它们都难以处理多模态符号推理，最佳模型GPT-4.1仅达到46.8%准确率。LogiCAM框架将GPT-4.1的思维链性能提升14.13%，在复杂逻辑如一阶逻辑上提升更大。

Conclusion: 当前多模态模型在多模态符号逻辑推理方面存在显著不足，约70%的错误源于模态间的逻辑不对齐。LogiCAM框架展示了通过形式逻辑规则提升推理能力的有效性，为未来改进提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Multimodal symbolic logical reasoning, which aims to deduce new facts from
multimodal input via formal logic, is critical in high-stakes applications such
as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, as its rigorous, deterministic
reasoning helps prevent serious consequences. To evaluate such capabilities of
current state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), we introduce the first
benchmark MuSLR for multimodal symbolic logical reasoning grounded in formal
logical rules. MuSLR comprises 1,093 instances across 7 domains, including 35
atomic symbolic logic and 976 logical combinations, with reasoning depths
ranging from 2 to 9. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art VLMs on MuSLR and find that
they all struggle with multimodal symbolic reasoning, with the best model,
GPT-4.1, achieving only 46.8%. Thus, we propose LogiCAM, a modular framework
that applies formal logical rules to multimodal inputs, boosting GPT-4.1's
Chain-of-Thought performance by 14.13%, and delivering even larger gains on
complex logics such as first-order logic. We also conduct a comprehensive error
analysis, showing that around 70% of failures stem from logical misalignment
between modalities, offering key insights to guide future improvements. All
data and code are publicly available at https://llm-symbol.github.io/MuSLR.

TL;DR: 提出了PatchEAD框架，一个统一的基于补丁的异常检测方法，无需训练即可与多种基础模型兼容，通过视觉提示技术实现优异的零样本和少样本性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业异常检测越来越依赖基础模型，但现有研究主要关注文本提示调优，而视觉对应部分则分散在各个基础模型特定的处理步骤中，缺乏统一性。

Method: 提出了Patch-Exclusive Anomaly Detection (PatchEAD)框架，包含对齐模块和前景掩码等视觉提示技术，构建统一的补丁聚焦框架。

Result: 实验显示在少样本和批量零样本性能上优于先前工作，即使没有文本特征。分析了骨干网络结构和预训练特性对补丁相似性鲁棒性的影响。

Conclusion: 统一的仅补丁框架能够实现快速、轻量校准的部署，无需精心设计的文本提示，为实际视觉检测中的基础模型选择和配置提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is increasingly relying on foundation models,
aiming for strong out-of-distribution generalization and rapid adaptation in
real-world deployments. Notably, past studies have primarily focused on textual
prompt tuning, leaving the intrinsic visual counterpart fragmented into
processing steps specific to each foundation model. We aim to address this
limitation by proposing a unified patch-focused framework, Patch-Exclusive
Anomaly Detection (PatchEAD), enabling training-free anomaly detection that is
compatible with diverse foundation models. The framework constructs visual
prompting techniques, including an alignment module and foreground masking. Our
experiments show superior few-shot and batch zero-shot performance compared to
prior work, despite the absence of textual features. Our study further examines
how backbone structure and pretrained characteristics affect patch-similarity
robustness, providing actionable guidance for selecting and configuring
foundation models for real-world visual inspection. These results confirm that
a well-unified patch-only framework can enable quick, calibration-light
deployment without the need for carefully engineered textual prompts.

TL;DR: 提出了一种硬件无关的多相机-LiDAR融合方法，能在低光照条件下生成360度彩色点云，无需专用标定目标即可实现实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合相机和LiDAR数据增强空间理解能力，特别针对低光照条件下的鲁棒性需求，简化系统标定流程。

Method: 使用多相机输入与机械LiDAR融合，集成低光图像增强模块，通过自动几何变换计算和色彩校正确保数据一致性。

Result: 系统在Velodyne Puck Hi-Res LiDAR和四相机配置下实现实时性能，在极低光照下仍能可靠着色并恢复不可见的场景细节。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、鲁棒的多传感器融合解决方案，特别适用于低光照环境下的空间感知应用。

Abstract: In recent years, the fusion of camera data with LiDAR measurements has
emerged as a powerful approach to enhance spatial understanding. This study
introduces a novel, hardware-agnostic methodology that generates colourised
point clouds from mechanical LiDAR using multiple camera inputs, providing
complete 360-degree coverage. The primary innovation lies in its robustness
under low-light conditions, achieved through the integration of a low-light
image enhancement module within the fusion pipeline. The system requires
initial calibration to determine intrinsic camera parameters, followed by
automatic computation of the geometric transformation between the LiDAR and
cameras, removing the need for specialised calibration targets and streamlining
the setup. The data processing framework uses colour correction to ensure
uniformity across camera feeds before fusion. The algorithm was tested using a
Velodyne Puck Hi-Res LiDAR and a four-camera configuration. The optimised
software achieved real-time performance and reliable colourisation even under
very low illumination, successfully recovering scene details that would
otherwise remain undetectable.

TL;DR: MAPLE是一个用于少样本全切片图像分类的分层提示学习框架，通过整合多尺度视觉语义，在实体和切片级别进行预测，解决了现有方法无法捕捉组织学实体亚型特异性表型变异的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖切片级提示，无法捕捉对癌症诊断至关重要的组织学实体（如细胞核、腺体）的亚型特异性表型变异。

Method: 利用LLM生成实体级和切片级提示；提出实体引导的交叉注意力模块生成实体级特征；开发跨尺度实体图学习模块丰富实体表示；结合实体级和切片级输出进行最终预测。

Result: 在三个癌症队列上的结果证实了该方法在解决少样本病理诊断任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: MAPLE通过整合多尺度视觉语义和分层预测，有效提升了少样本全切片图像分类的性能。

Abstract: Prompt learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for adapting pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) to few-shot whole slide image (WSI)
classification by aligning visual features with textual representations,
thereby reducing annotation cost and enhancing model generalization.
Nevertheless, existing methods typically rely on slide-level prompts and fail
to capture the subtype-specific phenotypic variations of histological entities
(\emph{e.g.,} nuclei, glands) that are critical for cancer diagnosis. To
address this gap, we propose Multi-scale Attribute-enhanced Prompt Learning
(\textbf{MAPLE}), a hierarchical framework for few-shot WSI classification that
jointly integrates multi-scale visual semantics and performs prediction at both
the entity and slide levels. Specifically, we first leverage large language
models (LLMs) to generate entity-level prompts that can help identify
multi-scale histological entities and their phenotypic attributes, as well as
slide-level prompts to capture global visual descriptions. Then, an
entity-guided cross-attention module is proposed to generate entity-level
features, followed by aligning with their corresponding subtype-specific
attributes for fine-grained entity-level prediction. To enrich entity
representations, we further develop a cross-scale entity graph learning module
that can update these representations by capturing their semantic correlations
within and across scales. The refined representations are then aggregated into
a slide-level representation and aligned with the corresponding prompts for
slide-level prediction. Finally, we combine both entity-level and slide-level
outputs to produce the final prediction results. Results on three cancer
cohorts confirm the effectiveness of our approach in addressing few-shot
pathology diagnosis tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的"图像思考"范式在数据构建准确性、结构设计和应用场景方面仍有很大探索空间，需要推进多模态推理的发展。

Method: 构建包含31k条思维链推理轨迹的数据集，设计直接在视觉嵌入空间进行图像-文本交错推理的模型，无需调用外部工具和重复编码生成图像。

Result: 在多模态推理基准测试中表现出强大性能，验证了数据集的实用性和模型设计的有效性。

Conclusion: DeepSketcher通过工具无关和更灵活的"图像思考"方式，为推进多模态推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The "thinking with images" paradigm represents a pivotal shift in the
reasoning of Vision Language Models (VLMs), moving from text-dominant
chain-of-thought to image-interactive reasoning. By invoking visual tools or
generating intermediate visual representations, VLMs can iteratively attend to
fine-grained regions, enabling deeper image understanding and more faithful
multimodal reasoning. As an emerging paradigm, however, it still leaves
substantial room for exploration in data construction accuracy, structural
design, and broader application scenarios, which offer rich opportunities for
advancing multimodal reasoning. To further advance this line of work, we
present DeepSketcher, a comprehensive suite comprising both an image-text
interleaved dataset and a self-contained model. The dataset contains 31k
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning trajectories with diverse tool calls and
resulting edited images, covering a wide range of data types and manipulation
instructions with high annotation accuracy. Building on this resource, we
design a model that performs interleaved image-text reasoning and natively
generates "visual thoughts" by operating directly in the visual embedding
space, rather than invoking external tools and repeatedly re-encoding generated
images. This design enables tool-free and more flexible "thinking with images".
Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate strong
performance, validating both the utility of the dataset and the effectiveness
of the model design.

Abstract: We introduce mpLLM, a prompt-conditioned hierarchical mixture-of-experts
(MoE) architecture for visual question answering over multi-parametric 3D brain
MRI (mpMRI). mpLLM routes across modality-level and token-level projection
experts to fuse multiple interrelated 3D modalities, enabling efficient
training without image--report pretraining. To address limited image-text
paired supervision, mpLLM integrates a synthetic visual question answering
(VQA) protocol that generates medically relevant VQA from segmentation
annotations, and we collaborate with medical experts for clinical validation.
mpLLM outperforms strong medical VLM baselines by 5.3% on average across
multiple mpMRI datasets. Our study features three main contributions: (1) the
first clinically validated VQA dataset for 3D brain mpMRI, (2) a novel
multimodal LLM that handles multiple interrelated 3D modalities, and (3) strong
empirical results that demonstrate the medical utility of our methodology.
Ablations highlight the importance of modality-level and token-level experts
and prompt-conditioned routing. We have included our source code in the

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) move into interactive, multi-turn use, new
safety risks arise that single-turn or single-modality moderation misses. In
Multimodal Multi-Turn (MMT) dialogues, malicious intent can be spread across
turns and images, while context-sensitive replies may still advance harmful
content. To address this challenge, we present the first systematic definition
and study of MMT dialogue safety. Building on this formulation, we introduce
the Multimodal Multi-turn Dialogue Safety (MMDS) dataset. We further develop an
automated multimodal multi-turn red-teaming framework based on Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to generate unsafe multimodal multi-turn dialogues for MMDS. MMDS
contains 4,484 annotated multimodal dialogue samples with fine-grained safety
ratings, policy dimension labels, and evidence-based rationales for both users
and assistants. Leveraging MMDS, we present LLaVAShield, a powerful tool that
jointly detects and assesses risk in user inputs and assistant responses.
Across comprehensive experiments, LLaVAShield consistently outperforms strong
baselines on MMT content moderation tasks and under dynamic policy
configurations, establishing new state-of-the-art results. We will publicly
release the dataset and model to support future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型擅长高层次场景理解，但在需要精确定位的细粒度感知任务中表现不佳，因为语言中心架构难以生成精确的数值坐标。

Method: 提出VLM-FO1框架，包含混合细粒度区域编码器（HFRE）和基于token的引用系统，将对象感知从脆弱的坐标生成问题转化为稳健的特征检索任务。

Result: VLM-FO1在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，在对象定位、区域生成理解和视觉区域推理方面表现出色，且不损害基础模型的通用视觉理解能力。

Conclusion: VLM-FO1建立了一个有效灵活的模式，用于构建感知感知的视觉语言模型，弥合了高层次推理和细粒度视觉定位之间的差距。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level scene understanding but
falter on fine-grained perception tasks requiring precise localization. This
failure stems from a fundamental mismatch, as generating exact numerical
coordinates is a challenging task for language-centric architectures. In this
paper, we introduce VLM-FO1, a novel framework that overcomes this limitation
by reframing object-centric perception from a brittle coordinate generation
problem into a robust feature retrieval task. Our method operates as a
plug-and-play module that integrates with any pre-trained VLM. It leverages a
Hybrid Fine-grained Region Encoder (HFRE), featuring a dual vision encoder, to
generate powerful region tokens rich in both semantic and spatial detail. A
token-based referencing system then enables the LLM to seamlessly reason about
and ground language in these specific visual regions. Experiments show that
VLM-FO1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse suite of
benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in object grounding, region
generational understanding, and visual region reasoning. Crucially, our
two-stage training strategy ensures that these perception gains are achieved
without compromising the base model's general visual understanding
capabilities. VLM-FO1 establishes an effective and flexible paradigm for
building perception-aware VLMs, bridging the gap between high-level reasoning
and fine-grained visual grounding.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了训练数据特性对深度神经网络对抗鲁棒性的影响，发现鲁棒性遵循数据量和模型规模的对数缩放定律，但数据质量、架构和训练目标比原始规模对实现广泛对抗鲁棒性更为关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度神经网络在架构和训练范式上有所进步，但仍然容易受到对抗样本的攻击。研究旨在探索训练数据特性如何影响对抗鲁棒性。

Method: 评估了36种最先进的视觉模型，涵盖监督、自监督和对比学习方法，在1.2M到22B图像的数据集上训练。在六种黑盒攻击类别下评估模型：随机扰动、两种几何掩码、COCO对象操作、ImageNet-C损坏和ImageNet-R风格转移。

Result: 鲁棒性遵循数据量和模型规模的对数缩放定律：数据量增加10倍平均降低攻击成功率(ASR)约3.2%，模型规模增加10倍平均降低ASR约13.4%。自监督模型在精选数据集上表现优于更大但较少精选的数据集。对抗微调改善了结构变化泛化，但对颜色分布无效。

Conclusion: 虽然扩展规模能提高鲁棒性，但数据质量、架构和训练目标在实现广泛对抗鲁棒性方面比原始规模起着更决定性的作用。

Abstract: Deep neural networks remain vulnerable to adversarial examples despite
advances in architectures and training paradigms. We investigate how training
data characteristics affect adversarial robustness across 36 state-of-the-art
vision models spanning supervised, self-supervised, and contrastive learning
approaches, trained on datasets from 1.2M to 22B images. Models were evaluated
under six black-box attack categories: random perturbations, two types of
geometric masks, COCO object manipulations, ImageNet-C corruptions, and
ImageNet-R style shifts. Robustness follows a logarithmic scaling law with both
data volume and model size: a tenfold increase in data reduces attack success
rate (ASR) on average by ~3.2%, whereas a tenfold increase in model size
reduces ASR on average by ~13.4%. Notably, some self-supervised models trained
on curated datasets, such as DINOv2, outperform others trained on much larger
but less curated datasets, challenging the assumption that scale alone drives
robustness. Adversarial fine-tuning of ResNet50s improves generalization across
structural variations but not across color distributions. Human evaluation
reveals persistent gaps between human and machine vision. These results show
that while scaling improves robustness, data quality, architecture, and
training objectives play a more decisive role than raw scale in achieving
broad-spectrum adversarial resilience.

Conclusion: UniMMAD通过统一框架解决了多模态多类别异常检测中的碎片化和效率问题，证明了其有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Existing anomaly detection (AD) methods often treat the modality and class as
independent factors. Although this paradigm has enriched the development of AD
research branches and produced many specialized models, it has also led to
fragmented solutions and excessive memory overhead. Moreover,
reconstruction-based multi-class approaches typically rely on shared decoding
paths, which struggle to handle large variations across domains, resulting in
distorted normality boundaries, domain interference, and high false alarm
rates. To address these limitations, we propose UniMMAD, a unified framework
for multi-modal and multi-class anomaly detection. At the core of UniMMAD is a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-driven feature decompression mechanism, which enables
adaptive and disentangled reconstruction tailored to specific domains. This
process is guided by a ``general to specific'' paradigm. In the encoding stage,
multi-modal inputs of varying combinations are compressed into compact,
general-purpose features. The encoder incorporates a feature compression module
to suppress latent anomalies, encourage cross-modal interaction, and avoid
shortcut learning. In the decoding stage, the general features are decompressed
into modality-specific and class-specific forms via a sparsely-gated cross MoE,
which dynamically selects expert pathways based on input modality and class. To
further improve efficiency, we design a grouped dynamic filtering mechanism and
a MoE-in-MoE structure, reducing parameter usage by 75\% while maintaining
sparse activation and fast inference. UniMMAD achieves state-of-the-art
performance on 9 anomaly detection datasets, spanning 3 fields, 12 modalities,
and 66 classes.

*Debottam Dutta,Jianchong Chen,Rajalaxmi Rajagopalan,Yu-Lin Wei,Romit Roy Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CO3方法，通过校正采样策略改进文本到图像扩散模型中多概念提示的保真度，避免概念缺失或碰撞问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多概念提示（如"猫和狗"）在扩散模型中常出现的概念缺失、模糊或相互碰撞的问题，这些是由于模型在训练过程中对某些概念学习过强导致的模式混合

Method: 引入校正采样策略，引导模型远离联合提示行为与单个概念重叠过强的区域，转向所有概念能够平衡共存的"纯"联合模式；分析现有多概念引导方案的不稳定权重机制，并适配采样以保持在有利区域内

Result: 在多样化多概念提示上的实验表明，相比标准基线和现有组合方法，CO3在概念覆盖度、平衡性和鲁棒性方面均有改进，减少了概念丢失或扭曲的情况

Conclusion: 轻量级校正引导能够显著缓解现代扩散系统中脆弱的语义对齐行为，该方法即插即用，无需模型调优，可与标准无分类器引导互补

Abstract: We propose to improve multi-concept prompt fidelity in text-to-image
diffusion models. We begin with common failure cases-prompts like "a cat and a
dog" that sometimes yields images where one concept is missing, faint, or
colliding awkwardly with another. We hypothesize that this happens when the
diffusion model drifts into mixed modes that over-emphasize a single concept it
learned strongly during training. Instead of re-training, we introduce a
corrective sampling strategy that steers away from regions where the joint
prompt behavior overlaps too strongly with any single concept in the prompt.
The goal is to steer towards "pure" joint modes where all concepts can coexist
with balanced visual presence. We further show that existing multi-concept
guidance schemes can operate in unstable weight regimes that amplify imbalance;
we characterize favorable regions and adapt sampling to remain within them. Our
approach, CO3, is plug-and-play, requires no model tuning, and complements
standard classifier-free guidance. Experiments on diverse multi-concept prompts
indicate improvements in concept coverage, balance and robustness, with fewer
dropped or distorted concepts compared to standard baselines and prior
compositional methods. Results suggest that lightweight corrective guidance can
substantially mitigate brittle semantic alignment behavior in modern diffusion
systems.

*Longzhen Yang,Zhangkai Ni,Ying Wen,Yihang Liu,Lianghua He,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SS-ACL框架，无需专家标注即可生成视觉基础医学报告，通过解剖一致性学习实现报告与解剖区域的对齐，在准确性和临床效果上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学报告生成方法依赖单独训练的检测模块，需要大量专家标注，成本高且由于病理分布偏差导致泛化能力有限。

Method: 提出自监督解剖一致性学习(SS-ACL)，构建分层解剖图，通过递归重建细粒度解剖区域实现空间对齐，并引入基于解剖一致性的区域级对比学习增强语义对齐。

Result: 无需专家标注，在词汇准确性上优于最先进方法10%，临床效果提升25%，在零样本视觉定位任务上超越领先视觉基础模型8%。

Conclusion: SS-ACL框架能够生成准确且视觉基础的医学报告，在多项任务上表现出色，为临床工作流程提供了可解释的视觉证据。

Abstract: Vision-grounded medical report generation aims to produce clinically accurate
descriptions of medical images, anchored in explicit visual evidence to improve
interpretability and facilitate integration into clinical workflows. However,
existing methods often rely on separately trained detection modules that
require extensive expert annotations, introducing high labeling costs and
limiting generalizability due to pathology distribution bias across datasets.
To address these challenges, we propose Self-Supervised Anatomical Consistency
Learning (SS-ACL) -- a novel and annotation-free framework that aligns
generated reports with corresponding anatomical regions using simple textual
prompts. SS-ACL constructs a hierarchical anatomical graph inspired by the
invariant top-down inclusion structure of human anatomy, organizing entities by
spatial location. It recursively reconstructs fine-grained anatomical regions
to enforce intra-sample spatial alignment, inherently guiding attention maps
toward visually relevant areas prompted by text. To further enhance
inter-sample semantic alignment for abnormality recognition, SS-ACL introduces
a region-level contrastive learning based on anatomical consistency. These
aligned embeddings serve as priors for report generation, enabling attention
maps to provide interpretable visual evidence. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SS-ACL, without relying on expert annotations, (i) generates
accurate and visually grounded reports -- outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by 10\% in lexical accuracy and 25\% in clinical efficacy, and (ii)
achieves competitive performance on various downstream visual tasks, surpassing
current leading visual foundation models by 8\% in zero-shot visual grounding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算机视觉方法只能单独计算福利指标，且在复杂水下场景中容易受到遮挡、外观相似和运动相似等问题的干扰。

Method: 使用姿态估计网络提取鲑鱼及其身体部位的边界框，通过专门模块利用身体部位信息解决水下鲑鱼追踪的特定挑战。

Result: 在两个新的鲑鱼追踪数据集上，该方法优于当前最先进的行人追踪器BoostTrack，并成功应用于尾拍波长分析。

Conclusion: 提出的身体部位追踪方法适用于基于尾拍分析的自动化鲑鱼福利监测，为工业水产养殖提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Computer Vision (CV)-based continuous, automated and precise salmon welfare
monitoring is a key step toward reduced salmon mortality and improved salmon
welfare in industrial aquaculture net pens. Available CV methods for
determining welfare indicators focus on single indicators and rely on object
detectors and trackers from other application areas to aid their welfare
indicator calculation algorithm. This comes with a high resource demand for
real-world applications, since each indicator must be calculated separately. In
addition, the methods are vulnerable to difficulties in underwater salmon
scenes, such as object occlusion, similar object appearance, and similar object
motion. To address these challenges, we propose a flexible tracking framework
that uses a pose estimation network to extract bounding boxes around salmon and
their corresponding body parts, and exploits information about the body parts,
through specialized modules, to tackle challenges specific to underwater salmon
scenes. Subsequently, the high-detail body part tracks are employed to
calculate welfare indicators. We construct two novel datasets assessing two
salmon tracking challenges: salmon ID transfers in crowded scenes and salmon ID
switches during turning. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art
pedestrian tracker, BoostTrack, for both salmon tracking challenges.
Additionally, we create a dataset for calculating salmon tail beat wavelength,
demonstrating that our body part tracking method is well-suited for automated
welfare monitoring based on tail beat analysis. Datasets and code are available
at https://github.com/espenbh/BoostCompTrack.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有交互式分割方法局限于粗粒度实例级目标，以及非交互式方法在稀疏真实世界扫描和标注数据缺乏方面的不足。

Method: 开发了新的3D数据合成流水线，创建大规模场景级数据集；提出交互式框架，通过用户点点击实现细粒度分割。

Result: 在首次点击设置下平均IoU达到55.8%，仅需少量额外点击即可超过71.3% IoU，相比现有最佳方法IoU和精度提升高达16%。

Conclusion: 该工作代表了在复杂3D环境中实现更细致和精确的机器感知与交互的重要进展。

Abstract: Fine-grained 3D part segmentation is crucial for enabling embodied AI systems
to perform complex manipulation tasks, such as interacting with specific
functional components of an object. However, existing interactive segmentation
methods are largely confined to coarse, instance-level targets, while
non-interactive approaches struggle with sparse, real-world scans and suffer
from a severe lack of annotated data. To address these limitations, we
introduce PinPoint3D, a novel interactive framework for fine-grained,
multi-granularity 3D segmentation, capable of generating precise part-level
masks from only a few user point clicks. A key component of our work is a new
3D data synthesis pipeline that we developed to create a large-scale,
scene-level dataset with dense part annotations, overcoming a critical
bottleneck that has hindered progress in this field. Through comprehensive
experiments and user studies, we demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average IoU of around 55.8% on
each object part under first-click settings and surpassing 71.3% IoU with only
a few additional clicks. Compared to current state-of-the-art baselines,
PinPoint3D yields up to a 16% improvement in IoU and precision, highlighting
its effectiveness on challenging, sparse point clouds with high efficiency. Our
work represents a significant step towards more nuanced and precise machine
perception and interaction in complex 3D environments.

TL;DR: 提出RH-Partial2Global方法，通过结合jackknife conformal prediction和covering design-based sampling，改进Partial2Global在视觉上下文学习中的示例选择效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VICL方法基于相似性优先假设缺乏充分理论依据，且Partial2Global依赖随机采样导致覆盖不完整和冗余比较，影响全局排序质量。

Method: 使用jackknife conformal prediction构建可靠替代集，采用covering design-based sampling确保成对偏好的全面均匀覆盖。

Result: 在多种视觉任务上，RH-Partial2Global表现出优异性能，优于Partial2Global方法。

Conclusion: RH-Partial2Global通过可靠替代集构建和全面采样策略，有效提升了视觉上下文学习中示例选择的可靠性和全面性。

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) has emerged as a prominent approach for
adapting visual foundation models to novel tasks, by effectively exploiting
contextual information embedded in in-context examples, which can be formulated
as a global ranking problem of potential candidates. Current VICL methods, such
as Partial2Global and VPR, are grounded in the similarity-priority assumption
that images more visually similar to a query image serve as better in-context
examples. This foundational assumption, while intuitive, lacks sufficient
justification for its efficacy in selecting optimal in-context examples.
Furthermore, Partial2Global constructs its global ranking from a series of
randomly sampled pairwise preference predictions. Such a reliance on random
sampling can lead to incomplete coverage and redundant samplings of
comparisons, thus further adversely impacting the final global ranking. To
address these issues, this paper introduces an enhanced variant of
Partial2Global designed for reliable and holistic selection of in-context
examples in VICL. Our proposed method, dubbed RH-Partial2Global, leverages a
jackknife conformal prediction-guided strategy to construct reliable
alternative sets and a covering design-based sampling approach to ensure
comprehensive and uniform coverage of pairwise preferences. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that RH-Partial2Global achieves excellent performance
and outperforms Partial2Global across diverse visual tasks.

TL;DR: 提出VRWKV-Editor视频编辑模型，通过线性时空聚合模块解决传统注意力机制二次计算复杂度问题，在保持质量的同时实现线性复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑模型因传统注意力机制的二次计算复杂度，难以适应长时长和高分辨率视频，限制了实时视频处理等实际应用。

Method: 将线性时空聚合模块集成到基于扩散的视频模型中，利用RWKV变换器的双向加权键值循环机制捕获全局依赖并保持时间一致性。

Result: 相比最先进的基于扩散的视频编辑方法，实现3.7倍加速和60%内存使用降低，同时在帧一致性和文本对齐方面保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法在长视频编辑中优势更明显，为高效视频处理提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: In light of recent progress in video editing, deep learning models focusing
on both spatial and temporal dependencies have emerged as the primary method.
However, these models suffer from the quadratic computational complexity of
traditional attention mechanisms, making them difficult to adapt to
long-duration and high-resolution videos. This limitation restricts their
applicability in practical contexts such as real-time video processing. To
tackle this challenge, we introduce a method to reduce both time and space
complexity of these systems by proposing VRWKV-Editor, a novel video editing
model that integrates a linear spatio-temporal aggregation module into
video-based diffusion models. VRWKV-Editor leverages bidirectional weighted
key-value recurrence mechanism of the RWKV transformer to capture global
dependencies while preserving temporal coherence, achieving linear complexity
without sacrificing quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 60% lower memory usage compared
to state-of-the-art diffusion-based video editing methods, while maintaining
competitive performance in frame consistency and text alignment. Furthermore, a
comparative analysis we conducted on videos with different sequence lengths
confirms that the gap in editing speed between our approach and architectures
with self-attention becomes more significant with long videos.

Method: 引入NS-iHOS任务，提出WISH端到端模型，从自然语言叙述中提取知识学习合理的手-物体关联，实现无叙述推理的手部物体分割。

Result: 在EPIC-Kitchens和Ego4D数据集上的实验表明，WISH超越所有基线方法，达到全监督方法50%以上的性能，且无需精细像素级标注。

Conclusion: 叙述监督为手部物体分割提供有效的弱监督信号，WISH模型展示了从自然语言中学习视觉任务的潜力，为减少标注成本提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Pixel-level recognition of objects manipulated by the user from egocentric
images enables key applications spanning assistive technologies, industrial
safety, and activity monitoring. However, progress in this area is currently
hindered by the scarcity of annotated datasets, as existing approaches rely on
costly manual labels. In this paper, we propose to learn human-object
interaction detection leveraging narrations -- natural language descriptions of
the actions performed by the camera wearer which contain clues about
manipulated objects (e.g., "I am pouring vegetables from the chopping board to
the pan"). Narrations provide a form of weak supervision that is cheap to
acquire and readily available in state-of-the-art egocentric datasets. We
introduce Narration-Supervised in-Hand Object Segmentation (NS-iHOS), a novel
task where models have to learn to segment in-hand objects by learning from
natural-language narrations. Narrations are then not employed at inference
time. We showcase the potential of the task by proposing Weakly-Supervised
In-hand Object Segmentation from Human Narrations (WISH), an end-to-end model
distilling knowledge from narrations to learn plausible hand-object
associations and enable in-hand object segmentation without using narrations at
test time. We benchmark WISH against different baselines based on
open-vocabulary object detectors and vision-language models, showing the
superiority of its design. Experiments on EPIC-Kitchens and Ego4D show that
WISH surpasses all baselines, recovering more than 50% of the performance of
fully supervised methods, without employing fine-grained pixel-wise
annotations.

TL;DR: 提出了AgenticIQA框架，将视觉语言模型与传统图像质量评估工具动态结合，通过分解任务为四个子任务来提升评估准确性和解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像质量评估方法使用固定模型输出标量分数，难以适应不同失真类型、用户特定查询和解释性需求，且评分与解释通常分离处理。

Method: AgenticIQA采用模块化代理框架，包含规划器、执行器和总结器，将IQA分解为失真检测、失真分析、工具选择和工具执行四个子任务，动态协调VLM与传统工具。

Result: 在多个IQA数据集上的实验表明，AgenticIQA在评分准确性和解释对齐方面均优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: AgenticIQA框架通过代理式方法有效整合了评分与解释过程，显著提升了图像质量评估的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Image quality assessment (IQA) is inherently complex, as it reflects both the
quantification and interpretation of perceptual quality rooted in the human
visual system. Conventional approaches typically rely on fixed models to output
scalar scores, limiting their adaptability to diverse distortions,
user-specific queries, and interpretability needs. Furthermore, scoring and
interpretation are often treated as independent processes, despite their
interdependence: interpretation identifies perceptual degradations, while
scoring abstracts them into a compact metric. To address these limitations, we
propose AgenticIQA, a modular agentic framework that integrates vision-language
models (VLMs) with traditional IQA tools in a dynamic, query-aware manner.
AgenticIQA decomposes IQA into four subtasks -- distortion detection,
distortion analysis, tool selection, and tool execution -- coordinated by a
planner, executor, and summarizer. The planner formulates task-specific
strategies, the executor collects perceptual evidence via tool invocation, and
the summarizer integrates this evidence to produce accurate scores with
human-aligned explanations. To support training and evaluation, we introduce
AgenticIQA-200K, a large-scale instruction dataset tailored for IQA agents, and
AgenticIQA-Eval, the first benchmark for assessing the planning, execution, and
summarization capabilities of VLM-based IQA agents. Extensive experiments
across diverse IQA datasets demonstrate that AgenticIQA consistently surpasses
strong baselines in both scoring accuracy and explanatory alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用针孔和鱼眼图像的互补特性（无失真vs失真、小FOVvs大FOV、远场vs近场）进行异构多视角深度估计的联合优化。

Method: 采用统一架构处理任意组合的针孔和鱼眼相机，首先将2D特征提升到规范3D体积空间，然后通过异构空间融合模块处理失真感知的体积特征，并创新性地使用3D高斯表示进行体素融合。

Result: 在KITTI-360和RealHet数据集上超越了当前主流深度网络，达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统研究异构针孔-鱼眼深度估计的工作，既提供了技术新颖性，也提供了有价值的实证见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first pinhole-fisheye framework for
heterogeneous multi-view depth estimation, PFDepth. Our key insight is to
exploit the complementary characteristics of pinhole and fisheye imagery
(undistorted vs. distorted, small vs. large FOV, far vs. near field) for joint
optimization. PFDepth employs a unified architecture capable of processing
arbitrary combinations of pinhole and fisheye cameras with varied intrinsics
and extrinsics. Within PFDepth, we first explicitly lift 2D features from each
heterogeneous view into a canonical 3D volumetric space. Then, a core module
termed Heterogeneous Spatial Fusion is designed to process and fuse
distortion-aware volumetric features across overlapping and non-overlapping
regions. Additionally, we subtly reformulate the conventional voxel fusion into
a novel 3D Gaussian representation, in which learnable latent Gaussian spheres
dynamically adapt to local image textures for finer 3D aggregation. Finally,
fused volume features are rendered into multi-view depth maps. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PFDepth sets a state-of-the-art
performance on KITTI-360 and RealHet datasets over current mainstream depth
networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of
heterogeneous pinhole-fisheye depth estimation, offering both technical novelty
and valuable empirical insights.

Motivation: 传统二阶PDE模型在去噪早期阶段会产生块状伪影，需要开发更有效的模型来同时实现噪声抑制和细节保留。

Method: 使用四阶非线性PDE模型，结合拉普拉斯算子和强度值的扩散过程，以及保持精细细节和纹理的波动部分。对彩色图像采用独立通道处理。

Result: 在PSNR、MSSIM和SI指标上均优于现有的二阶各向异性扩散方法，对灰度图像和彩色图像都能产生更好的结果。

Conclusion: 所提出的四阶PDE模型在乘性噪声抑制方面优于传统二阶模型，能有效减少块状伪影并保持图像细节和纹理。

Abstract: Second-order PDE models have been widely used for suppressing multiplicative
noise, but they often introduce blocky artifacts in the early stages of
denoising. To resolve this, we propose a fourth-order nonlinear PDE model that
integrates diffusion and wave properties. The diffusion process, guided by both
the Laplacian and intensity values, reduces noise better than gradient-based
methods, while the wave part keeps fine details and textures. The effectiveness
of the proposed model is evaluated against two second-order anisotropic
diffusion approaches using the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean
Structural Similarity Index (MSSIM) for images with available ground truth. For
SAR images, where a noise-free reference is unavailable, the Speckle Index (SI)
is used to measure noise reduction. Additionally, we extend the proposed model
to study color images by applying the denoising process independently to each
channel, preserving both structure and color consistency. The same quantitative
metrics PSNR and MSSIM are used for performance evaluation, ensuring a fair
comparison across grayscale and color images. In all the cases, our computed
results produce better results compared to existing models in this genre.

TL;DR: SETR提出了一种语义增强的两阶段检索方法，通过交集驱动策略过滤无关背景细节，并使用多模态LLM进行细粒度重排序，在零样本组合图像检索任务中取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有CLIP方法在零样本组合图像检索中的两个核心问题：基于并集的特征融合会携带无关背景细节，以及全局余弦相似度无法解析细粒度语义关系。

Method: 采用两阶段检索框架：粗检索阶段使用交集驱动策略保留参考图像和相对文本的重叠语义；重排序阶段使用低秩适配的多模态LLM进行二元语义相关性判断。

Result: 在CIRR、Fashion-IQ和CIRCO数据集上实现了最先进的性能，在CIRR数据集上Recall@1提升了15.15个百分点。

Conclusion: 两阶段推理是构建稳健且可移植的零样本组合图像检索系统的通用范式。

Abstract: Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve a target image
given a reference image and a relative text, without relying on costly triplet
annotations. Existing CLIP-based methods face two core challenges: (1)
union-based feature fusion indiscriminately aggregates all visual cues,
carrying over irrelevant background details that dilute the intended
modification, and (2) global cosine similarity from CLIP embeddings lacks the
ability to resolve fine-grained semantic relations. To address these issues, we
propose SETR (Semantic-enhanced Two-Stage Retrieval). In the coarse retrieval
stage, SETR introduces an intersection-driven strategy that retains only the
overlapping semantics between the reference image and relative text, thereby
filtering out distractors inherent to union-based fusion and producing a
cleaner, high-precision candidate set. In the fine-grained re-ranking stage, we
adapt a pretrained multimodal LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation to conduct binary
semantic relevance judgments ("Yes/No"), which goes beyond CLIP's global
feature matching by explicitly verifying relational and attribute-level
consistency. Together, these two stages form a complementary pipeline: coarse
retrieval narrows the candidate pool with high recall, while re-ranking ensures
precise alignment with nuanced textual modifications. Experiments on CIRR,
Fashion-IQ, and CIRCO show that SETR achieves new state-of-the-art performance,
improving Recall@1 on CIRR by up to 15.15 points. Our results establish
two-stage reasoning as a general paradigm for robust and portable ZS-CIR.

Motivation: 解决遥感数据和OSM数据之间的模态差异（数据结构、内容和空间粒度不同），现有遥感基础模型主要关注图像数据，缺乏与地理上下文的有效整合。

Method: 在预训练阶段使用OSM数据提供的多粒度学习信号，基于跨模态空间相关性进行信息交互；引入图像掩码重建实现稀疏输入的高效预训练；在下游任务中生成单模态和多模态细粒度编码。

Conclusion: 多模态协同在推进高级地理空间人工智能方面具有巨大潜力，空间相关性在多模态地理数据整合中发挥关键作用。

Abstract: Integrating ground-level geospatial data with rich geographic context, like
OpenStreetMap (OSM), into remote sensing (RS) foundation models (FMs) is
essential for advancing geospatial intelligence and supporting a broad spectrum
of tasks. However, modality gap between RS and OSM data, including differences
in data structure, content, and spatial granularity, makes effective synergy
highly challenging, and most existing RS FMs focus on imagery alone. To this
end, this study presents GeoLink, a multimodal framework that leverages OSM
data to enhance RS FM during both the pretraining and downstream task stages.
Specifically, GeoLink enhances RS self-supervised pretraining using
multi-granularity learning signals derived from OSM data, guided by cross-modal
spatial correlations for information interaction and collaboration. It also
introduces image mask-reconstruction to enable sparse input for efficient
pretraining. For downstream tasks, GeoLink generates both unimodal and
multimodal fine-grained encodings to support a wide range of applications, from
common RS interpretation tasks like land cover classification to more
comprehensive geographic tasks like urban function zone mapping. Extensive
experiments show that incorporating OSM data during pretraining enhances the
performance of the RS image encoder, while fusing RS and OSM data in downstream
tasks improves the FM's adaptability to complex geographic scenarios. These
results underscore the potential of multimodal synergy in advancing high-level
geospatial artificial intelligence. Moreover, we find that spatial correlation
plays a crucial role in enabling effective multimodal geospatial data
integration. Code, checkpoints, and using examples are released at

Abstract: Pre-trained video generation models hold great potential for generative video
super-resolution (VSR). However, adapting them for full-size VSR, as most
existing methods do, suffers from unnecessary intensive full-attention
computation and fixed output resolution. To overcome these limitations, we make
the first exploration into utilizing video diffusion priors for patch-wise VSR.
This is non-trivial because pre-trained video diffusion models are not native
for patch-level detail generation. To mitigate this challenge, we propose an
innovative approach, called PatchVSR, which integrates a dual-stream adapter
for conditional guidance. The patch branch extracts features from input patches
to maintain content fidelity while the global branch extracts context features
from the resized full video to bridge the generation gap caused by incomplete
semantics of patches. Particularly, we also inject the patch's location
information into the model to better contextualize patch synthesis within the
global video frame. Experiments demonstrate that our method can synthesize
high-fidelity, high-resolution details at the patch level. A tailor-made
multi-patch joint modulation is proposed to ensure visual consistency across
individually enhanced patches. Due to the flexibility of our patch-based
paradigm, we can achieve highly competitive 4K VSR based on a 512x512
resolution base model, with extremely high efficiency.

*Haoran Pei,Yuguang Yang,Kexin Liu,Baochang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CGP框架，通过基于ViT的因果掩码引导空间变化的高斯扰动，增强OOD泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习中OOD泛化的核心挑战，特别是在生物医学图像领域，现有方法追求域不变性但可能忽略因果机制

Method: 使用Vision Transformers生成软因果掩码，在输入图像中注入空间变化的高斯噪声，对背景区域施加更强扰动，对前景区域施加较弱扰动

Result: 在WILDS基准测试Camelyon17上相比最先进的OOD基线方法获得持续性能提升

Conclusion: 因果扰动作为可靠且可解释的泛化工具具有潜力

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains a central challenge in
deploying deep learning models to real-world scenarios, particularly in domains
such as biomedical images, where distribution shifts are both subtle and
pervasive. While existing methods often pursue domain invariance through
complex generative models or adversarial training, these approaches may
overlook the underlying causal mechanisms of generalization.In this work, we
propose Causally-Guided Gaussian Perturbations (CGP)-a lightweight framework
that enhances OOD generalization by injecting spatially varying noise into
input images, guided by soft causal masks derived from Vision Transformers. By
applying stronger perturbations to background regions and weaker ones to
foreground areas, CGP encourages the model to rely on causally relevant
features rather than spurious correlations.Experimental results on the
challenging WILDS benchmark Camelyon17 demonstrate consistent performance gains
over state-of-the-art OOD baselines, highlighting the potential of causal
perturbation as a tool for reliable and interpretable generalization.

*Christoph Timmermann,Hyunse Lee,Woojin Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeMoBridge是一个轻量级方法，通过语义模态桥将图像映射到文本模态，解决CLIP在小样本分类中的模态内不对齐问题，在低数据场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在零样本任务中表现良好，但在小样本分类中存在模态内不对齐问题，这是由于持续的模态差距和仅跨模态训练目标导致的嵌入空间未校准，使得直接图像间比较不可靠。

Method: 提出SeMoBridge方法，通过语义模态桥将图像映射到文本模态，同时保持语义内容不变。该方法为闭式解，可选择通过多模态监督训练，结合图像和文本对齐损失来优化投影。

Result: 实验表明，训练版本SeMoBridge-T仅需少量训练时间，总体优于其他方法，特别是在低数据场景（1、2和4样本）中表现突出。

Conclusion: SeMoBridge有效解决了CLIP在小样本分类中的模态内不对齐问题，提供了一种轻量级且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: While Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) excels at zero-shot tasks
by aligning image and text embeddings, its performance in few-shot
classification is hindered by a critical limitation: intra-modal misalignment.
This issue, caused by a persistent modality gap and CLIP's exclusively
inter-modal training objective, leaves the embedding spaces uncalibrated,
making direct image-to-image comparisons unreliable. Existing methods attempt
to address this by refining similarity logits or by computationally expensive
per-sample optimization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SeMoBridge,
a lightweight yet powerful approach that directly addresses the misalignment.
Our method maps images into the text modality, while keeping their semantic
content intact through what we call a Semantic Modality Bridge. SeMoBridge is
closed-form and can optionally be trained through multi-modal supervision,
combining image and text-alignment losses to optimize the projection.
Experiments show that the trained version, SeMoBridge-T, requires only a
fraction of the training time while overall outperforming other methods,
particularly in low-data scenarios (1, 2, and 4 shots). The code is available

TL;DR: 扩展HAMMER模型以处理全局场景不一致性，通过分割引导评分方法改进多模态操纵检测，特别是前景-背景不匹配问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HAMMER在多模态操纵检测中表现优异，但在处理主要主体被错误放置在不可信背景中的全局场景不一致时表现不佳，存在标签空间偏差、局部注意力焦点和虚假文本-前景对齐等问题

Method: 提出轻量级分割引导评分(SGS)流程，使用人物/面部分割掩码分离前景和背景区域，通过联合视觉语言模型提取嵌入，计算区域感知一致性分数，并与HAMMER原始预测融合

Result: SGS显著提高了对全局操纵的鲁棒性，改进了二元检测、定位和标记级解释，且仅需推理阶段，计算开销可忽略

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了在多模态虚假信息检测中区域感知推理的重要性

Abstract: We extend HAMMER, a state-of-the-art model for multimodal manipulation
detection, to handle global scene inconsistencies such as foreground-background
(FG-BG) mismatch. While HAMMER achieves strong performance on the DGM4 dataset,
it consistently fails when the main subject is contextually misplaced into an
implausible background. We diagnose this limitation as a combination of
label-space bias, local attention focus, and spurious text-foreground
alignment. To remedy this without retraining, we propose a lightweight
segmentation-guided scoring (SGS) pipeline. SGS uses person/face segmentation
masks to separate foreground and background regions, extracts embeddings with a
joint vision-language model, and computes region-aware coherence scores. These
scores are fused with HAMMER's original prediction to improve binary detection,
grounding, and token-level explanations. SGS is inference-only, incurs
negligible computational overhead, and significantly enhances robustness to
global manipulations. This work demonstrates the importance of region-aware
reasoning in multimodal disinformation detection. We release scripts for
segmentation and scoring at https://github.com/Gaganx0/HAMMER-sgs

TL;DR: 该论文扩展了DGM4数据集，新增了5000个包含前景-背景不匹配及其与文本操作混合的高质量样本，创建了DGM4+基准数据集，用于测试检测器在局部和全局推理方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DGM4数据集仅限于局部操作（如人脸交换、属性编辑和字幕更改），而现实世界伪造中普遍存在全局不一致性（如前景与背景不匹配），这留下了关键的研究空白。

Method: 使用OpenAI的gpt-image-1和精心设计的提示生成以人为中心的新闻风格图像，将真实人物置于荒谬或不可能的背景下。字幕在三种条件下生成：字面、文本属性和文本分割，产生三种新的操作类别。

Result: 创建了包含FG-BG、FG-BG+TA和FG-BG+TS三种新操作类别的DGM4+数据集，包含5000个高质量样本，具有质量控制管道确保数据质量。

Conclusion: 通过引入全局操作，DGM4+扩展补充了现有数据集，创建了一个测试检测器局部和全局推理能力的基准，旨在加强多模态模型的评估，特别是那些当前在处理前景-背景不一致性方面存在困难的模型。

Abstract: The rapid advances in generative models have significantly lowered the
barrier to producing convincing multimodal disinformation. Fabricated images
and manipulated captions increasingly co-occur to create persuasive false
narratives. While the Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation
(DGM4) dataset established a foundation for research in this area, it is
restricted to local manipulations such as face swaps, attribute edits, and
caption changes. This leaves a critical gap: global inconsistencies, such as
mismatched foregrounds and backgrounds, which are now prevalent in real-world
forgeries. To address this, we extend DGM4 with 5,000 high-quality samples that
introduce Foreground-Background (FG-BG) mismatches and their hybrids with text
manipulations. Using OpenAI's gpt-image-1 and carefully designed prompts, we
generate human-centric news-style images where authentic figures are placed
into absurd or impossible backdrops (e.g., a teacher calmly addressing students
on the surface of Mars). Captions are produced under three conditions: literal,
text attribute, and text split, yielding three new manipulation categories:
FG-BG, FG-BG+TA, and FG-BG+TS. Quality control pipelines enforce one-to-three
visible faces, perceptual hash deduplication, OCR-based text scrubbing, and
realistic headline length. By introducing global manipulations, our extension
complements existing datasets, creating a benchmark DGM4+ that tests detectors
on both local and global reasoning. This resource is intended to strengthen
evaluation of multimodal models such as HAMMER, which currently struggle with
FG-BG inconsistencies. We release our DGM4+ dataset and generation script at
https://github.com/Gaganx0/DGM4plus

Motivation: 计算机视觉和医学应用中的数据集通常包含对称性，传统方法使用数据增强来学习这些对称性，但希望避免数据增强并构建更可持续的算法。

Method: 使用主纤维丛的截面概念来消除对称性，提出了一种包含恒定速度参数化作为特例的2参数曲线规范参数化族，通过优化截面来最大化类别分离。

Result: 在包含平移、旋转、缩放和重参数化对称性的对象轮廓数据集上验证了该方法，展示了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种简单有效的方式来处理对称性，具有广泛的应用潜力，相关代码和教程已开源。

Abstract: Most datasets encountered in computer vision and medical applications present
symmetries that should be taken into account in classification tasks. A typical
example is the symmetry by rotation and/or scaling in object detection. A
common way to build neural networks that learn the symmetries is to use data
augmentation. In order to avoid data augmentation and build more sustainable
algorithms, we present an alternative method to mod out symmetries based on the
notion of section of a principal fiber bundle. This framework allows the use of
simple metrics on the space of objects in order to measure dissimilarities
between orbits of objects under the symmetry group. Moreover, the section used
can be optimized to maximize separation of classes. We illustrate this
methodology on a dataset of contours of objects for the groups of translations,
rotations, scalings and reparameterizations. In particular, we present a
$2$-parameter family of canonical parameterizations of curves, containing the
constant-speed parameterization as a special case, which we believe is
interesting in its own right. We hope that this simple application will serve
to convey the geometric concepts underlying this method, which have a wide
range of possible applications. The code is available at the following link:

TL;DR: 提出使用基础模型生成3D伪标签，结合时序信息进行标签稠密化，显著提升语义占据预测性能，避免了传统自监督方法的高计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自监督方法如新视角合成、跨视图渲染等计算成本高、内存占用大，且难以迁移到其他架构。需要一种更高效、可迁移的解决方案。

Method: 使用Grounded-SAM和Metric3Dv2基础模型生成3D伪标签，利用时序信息进行标签稠密化，提出EasyOcc简化模型仅从伪标签学习。

Result: 在OccNeRF模型上mIoU从9.73提升到14.09（提升45%），EasyOcc达到13.86 mIoU，在无相机掩码的全场景评估中达到7.71 mIoU，超越之前最佳模型31%。

Conclusion: 基础模型、时序上下文和损失计算空间的选择在自监督学习的全面场景理解中具有关键重要性。

Abstract: Self-supervised models have recently achieved notable advancements,
particularly in the domain of semantic occupancy prediction. These models
utilize sophisticated loss computation strategies to compensate for the absence
of ground-truth labels. For instance, techniques such as novel view synthesis,
cross-view rendering, and depth estimation have been explored to address the
issue of semantic and depth ambiguity. However, such techniques typically incur
high computational costs and memory usage during the training stage, especially
in the case of novel view synthesis. To mitigate these issues, we propose 3D
pseudo-ground-truth labels generated by the foundation models Grounded-SAM and
Metric3Dv2, and harness temporal information for label densification. Our 3D
pseudo-labels can be easily integrated into existing models, which yields
substantial performance improvements, with mIoU increasing by 45\%, from 9.73
to 14.09, when implemented into the OccNeRF model. This stands in contrast to
earlier advancements in the field, which are often not readily transferable to
other architectures. Additionally, we propose a streamlined model, EasyOcc,
achieving 13.86 mIoU. This model conducts learning solely from our labels,
avoiding complex rendering strategies mentioned previously. Furthermore, our
method enables models to attain state-of-the-art performance when evaluated on
the full scene without applying the camera mask, with EasyOcc achieving 7.71
mIoU, outperforming the previous best model by 31\%. These findings highlight
the critical importance of foundation models, temporal context, and the choice
of loss computation space in self-supervised learning for comprehensive scene
understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点球经常决定冠军归属，但守门员必须在极短时间内从细微的生物力学线索中预判射门方向

Method: 采用双分支架构：MobileNetV2 CNN处理RGB帧，LSTM网络处理2D关键点并带有注意力机制，姿态关键点引导视觉关注任务相关区域，基于距离的阈值方法分割输入序列

Result: 在755个点球事件的数据集上测试，准确率89%，比仅视觉和仅姿态的基线模型提升14-22%

Conclusion: 轻量级和可解释的设计适用于守门员训练、战术分析和实时比赛分析

Abstract: Penalty kicks often decide championships, yet goalkeepers must anticipate the
kicker's intent from subtle biomechanical cues within a very short time window.
This study introduces a real-time, multi-modal deep learning framework to
predict the direction of a penalty kick (left, middle, or right) before ball
contact. The model uses a dual-branch architecture: a MobileNetV2-based CNN
extracts spatial features from RGB frames, while 2D keypoints are processed by
an LSTM network with attention mechanisms. Pose-derived keypoints further guide
visual focus toward task-relevant regions. A distance-based thresholding method
segments input sequences immediately before ball contact, ensuring consistent
input across diverse footage. A custom dataset of 755 penalty kick events was
created from real match videos, with frame-level annotations for object
detection, shooter keypoints, and final ball placement. The model achieved 89%
accuracy on a held-out test set, outperforming visual-only and pose-only
baselines by 14-22%. With an inference time of 22 milliseconds, the lightweight
and interpretable design makes it suitable for goalkeeper training, tactical
analysis, and real-time game analytics.

Motivation: 当前文本到场景方法在处理复杂几何和对象变换时表现不佳，对复杂指令的遵循能力较弱，需要更强大的推理能力来改进场景合成质量。

Method: 集成大型推理模型，使用涵盖物理、功能和上下文属性的标题进行对象检索，基于隐式和显式布局约束放置对象，并通过碰撞感知的空间推理优化位置。

Result: 在从简单到复杂的室内配置指令评估中，Reason-3D在人类评分的视觉保真度、约束遵循和资源检索质量方面显著优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 该工作不仅推动了文本到场景生成领域，还展示了现代大型推理模型的高级空间推理能力，并发布了代码库以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Prompt-driven scene synthesis allows users to generate complete 3D
environments from textual descriptions. Current text-to-scene methods often
struggle with complex geometries and object transformations, and tend to show
weak adherence to complex instructions. We address these limitations by
introducing Reason-3D, a text-to-scene model powered by large reasoning models
(LRMs). Reason-3D integrates object retrieval using captions covering physical,
functional, and contextual attributes. Reason-3D then places the selected
objects based on implicit and explicit layout constraints, and refines their
positions with collision-aware spatial reasoning. Evaluated on instructions
ranging from simple to complex indoor configurations, Reason-3D significantly
outperforms previous methods in human-rated visual fidelity, adherence to
constraints, and asset retrieval quality. Beyond its contribution to the field
of text-to-scene generation, our work showcases the advanced spatial reasoning
abilities of modern LRMs. Additionally, we release the codebase to further the
research in object retrieval and placement with LRMs.

TL;DR: EVODiff提出了一种基于信息论的扩散模型推理方法，通过优化条件熵来系统性地减少去噪过程中的不确定性，显著提升了生成质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成方面表现出色，但存在推理速度慢和训练-推理差异的问题。现有梯度求解器缺乏信息传输效率的理论基础。

Method: 从信息论角度分析扩散模型推理过程，提出熵感知方差优化方法(EVODiff)，通过优化条件熵来最小化转换和重建误差。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上，EVODiff在10次函数评估时将重建误差降低45.5%(FID从5.10提升到2.78)；在ImageNet-256上，将NFE成本减少25%(从20降到15)；同时改善了文本到图像生成质量并减少了伪影。

Conclusion: EVODiff通过信息论视角为扩散模型推理提供了理论基础，显著优于现有最先进的梯度求解器，在生成质量和效率方面都取得了突破性进展。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) excel in image generation, but suffer from slow
inference and the training-inference discrepancies. Although gradient-based
solvers like DPM-Solver accelerate the denoising inference, they lack
theoretical foundations in information transmission efficiency. In this work,
we introduce an information-theoretic perspective on the inference processes of
DMs, revealing that successful denoising fundamentally reduces conditional
entropy in reverse transitions. This principle leads to our key insights into
the inference processes: (1) data prediction parameterization outperforms its
noise counterpart, and (2) optimizing conditional variance offers a
reference-free way to minimize both transition and reconstruction errors. Based
on these insights, we propose an entropy-aware variance optimized method for
the generative process of DMs, called EVODiff, which systematically reduces
uncertainty by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising. Extensive
experiments on DMs validate our insights and demonstrate that our method
significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
gradient-based solvers. For example, compared to the DPM-Solver++, EVODiff
reduces the reconstruction error by up to 45.5\% (FID improves from 5.10 to
2.78) at 10 function evaluations (NFE) on CIFAR-10, cuts the NFE cost by 25\%
(from 20 to 15 NFE) for high-quality samples on ImageNet-256, and improves
text-to-image generation while reducing artifacts. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoGen是首个基于视觉自回归(VAR)模型的前馈式主题驱动生成框架，通过双路径注入策略分离主题的高层语义身份和底层细节，在保持高质量的同时显著降低采样延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主题驱动生成方法存在效率与质量的两难：要么需要昂贵的逐主题微调，要么使用推理速度慢的扩散模型。VAR模型具有快速采样和强生成质量的优势，但尚未被用于解决这一矛盾。

Method: 采用双路径注入策略：语义编码器提取主题抽象身份，通过解耦交叉注意力注入以指导整体构图；内容编码器捕捉精细视觉细节，通过多模态注意力机制集成以确保高保真纹理和结构保留。

Result: 定量和定性结果证实，EchoGen在主题保真度和图像质量上可与最先进的基于扩散的方法相媲美，同时采样延迟显著降低。

Conclusion: EchoGen成功将VAR模型应用于主题驱动生成，解决了效率与质量之间的权衡问题，为快速高质量的主题驱动生成提供了新方案。

Abstract: Subject-driven generation is a critical task in creative AI; yet current
state-of-the-art methods present a stark trade-off. They either rely on
computationally expensive, per-subject fine-tuning, sacrificing efficiency and
zero-shot capability, or employ feed-forward architectures built on diffusion
models, which are inherently plagued by slow inference speeds. Visual
Auto-Regressive (VAR) models are renowned for their rapid sampling speeds and
strong generative quality, making them an ideal yet underexplored foundation
for resolving this tension. To bridge this gap, we introduce EchoGen, a
pioneering framework that empowers VAR models with subject-driven generation
capabilities. The core design of EchoGen is an effective dual-path injection
strategy that disentangles a subject's high-level semantic identity from its
low-level fine-grained details, enabling enhanced controllability and fidelity.
We employ a semantic encoder to extract the subject's abstract identity, which
is injected through decoupled cross-attention to guide the overall composition.
Concurrently, a content encoder captures intricate visual details, which are
integrated via a multi-modal attention mechanism to ensure high-fidelity
texture and structural preservation. To the best of our knowledge, EchoGen is
the first feed-forward subject-driven framework built upon VAR models. Both
quantitative and qualitative results substantiate our design, demonstrating
that EchoGen achieves subject fidelity and image quality comparable to
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods with significantly lower sampling
latency. Code and models will be released soon.

TL;DR: 提出EntroPE框架，通过条件熵动态检测时间序列中的过渡点来构建动态patch边界，解决了传统固定patch方法破坏时间连贯性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于patch的时间序列预测方法采用时间无关的patch构建策略，任意起始位置和固定长度会破坏时间连贯性，分割自然过渡点，削弱短期依赖关系和表示学习。

Method: EntroPE包含两个关键模块：基于熵的动态patcher（EDP）使用信息论标准定位自然时间变化点并确定patch边界；自适应patch编码器（APE）使用池化和交叉注意力捕获patch内依赖关系并生成固定大小的潜在表示。

Result: 在长期预测基准测试中，EntroPE在准确性和效率方面都有提升，证明了熵引导的动态patch构建是时间序列建模的有前景新范式。

Conclusion: 熵引导的动态patch编码能够有效保留时间结构，同时保持patching的计算优势，为时间序列建模提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting,
with patch-based input strategies offering efficiency and improved long-horizon
modeling. Yet, existing approaches rely on temporally-agnostic patch
construction, where arbitrary starting positions and fixed lengths fracture
temporal coherence by splitting natural transitions across boundaries. This
naive segmentation often disrupts short-term dependencies and weakens
representation learning. In response, we propose EntroPE (Entropy-Guided
Dynamic Patch Encoder), a novel, temporally informed framework that dynamically
detects transition points via conditional entropy and dynamically places patch
boundaries. This preserves temporal structure while retaining the computational
benefits of patching. EntroPE consists of two key modules, namely an
Entropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) that applies information-theoretic criteria
to locate natural temporal shifts and determine patch boundaries, and an
Adaptive Patch Encoder (APE) that employs pooling and cross-attention to
capture intra-patch dependencies and produce fixed-size latent representations.
These embeddings are then processed by a global transformer to model
inter-patch dynamics. Experiments across long-term forecasting benchmarks
demonstrate that EntroPE improves both accuracy and efficiency, establishing
entropy-guided dynamic patching as a promising new paradigm for time series
modeling. Code is available at: https://github.com/Sachithx/EntroPE.

Abstract: The performance of deep neural networks is strongly influenced by the quality
of their training data. However, mitigating dataset bias by manually curating
challenging edge cases remains a major bottleneck. To address this, we propose
an automated pipeline for text-guided edge-case synthesis. Our approach employs
a Large Language Model, fine-tuned via preference learning, to rephrase image

generating difficult visual scenarios. Evaluated on the FishEye8K object

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
advances in visual understanding tasks. However, their capacity to comprehend
human-centric scenes has rarely been explored, primarily due to the absence of
comprehensive evaluation benchmarks that take into account both the
human-oriented granular level and higher-dimensional causal reasoning ability.
Such high-quality evaluation benchmarks face tough obstacles, given the
physical complexity of the human body and the difficulty of annotating granular
structures. In this paper, we propose Human-MME, a curated benchmark designed
to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric scene
understanding. Compared with other existing benchmarks, our work provides three
key features: 1. Diversity in human scene, spanning 4 primary visual domains
with 15 secondary domains and 43 sub-fields to ensure broad scenario coverage.
2. Progressive and diverse evaluation dimensions, evaluating the human-based
activities progressively from the human-oriented granular perception to the
higher-dimensional reasoning, consisting of eight dimensions with 19,945
real-world image question pairs and an evaluation suite. 3. High-quality

### [90] [Beyond Overall Accuracy: Pose- and Occlusion-driven Fairness Analysis in Pedestrian Detection for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26166)
*Mohammad Khoshkdahan,Arman Akbari,Arash Akbari,Xuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文首次对自动驾驶中的行人检测进行了全面的姿态和遮挡感知公平性评估，发现检测模型对平行腿、直肘和侧向姿态的行人存在偏见，且下半身关节遮挡比上半身和头部遮挡对检测率影响更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然许多检测模型旨在降低漏检率并处理遮挡和远距离识别等挑战，但公平性仍然是一个未被充分探索但同样重要的问题。本文系统研究行人姿态变化（包括腿部状态、肘部状态和身体方向）以及个体关节遮挡如何影响检测性能。

Method: 在ECP-DP数据集上评估五个行人专用检测器（F2DNet、MGAN、ALFNet、CSP和Cascade R-CNN）和三个通用模型（YOLOv12变体），使用EOD指标量化公平性，并应用Z检验评估统计显著性和鲁棒性。

Result: 研究发现检测模型对平行腿、直肘和侧向姿态的行人存在偏见。下半身关节遮挡比上半身和头部遮挡对检测率有更负面的影响。Cascade R-CNN实现了最低的总体漏检率，并在所有属性中表现出最小的偏见。

Conclusion: 这是自动驾驶行人检测领域首次全面的姿态和遮挡感知公平性评估，揭示了现有检测模型在公平性方面的重要局限性，为未来开发更公平的行人检测系统提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Pedestrian detection plays a critical role in autonomous driving (AD), where
ensuring safety and reliability is important. While many detection models aim
to reduce miss-rates and handle challenges such as occlusion and long-range
recognition, fairness remains an underexplored yet equally important concern.
In this work, we systematically investigate how variations in the pedestrian
pose -- including leg status, elbow status, and body orientation -- as well as
individual joint occlusions, affect detection performance. We evaluate five
pedestrian-specific detectors (F2DNet, MGAN, ALFNet, CSP, and Cascade R-CNN)
alongside three general-purpose models (YOLOv12 variants) on the EuroCity
Persons Dense Pose (ECP-DP) dataset. Fairness is quantified using the Equal
Opportunity Difference (EOD) metric across various confidence thresholds. To
assess statistical significance and robustness, we apply the Z-test. Our
findings highlight biases against pedestrians with parallel legs, straight
elbows, and lateral views. Occlusion of lower body joints has a more negative
impact on the detection rate compared to the upper body and head. Cascade R-CNN
achieves the lowest overall miss-rate and exhibits the smallest bias across all
attributes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive pose-
and occlusion-aware fairness evaluation in pedestrian detection for AD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttriGen是一个用于计算机视觉中自动化、细粒度多属性标注的新框架，特别关注细胞显微镜领域。该框架使用双模型架构，结合CNN进行细胞类型分类和Vision Transformer进行多属性分类，在WBCAtt数据集上达到94.62%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在细胞显微镜领域，多属性分类相比传统的细胞类型分类仍然代表性不足。传统的人工标注方法耗时耗力，需要一种自动化解决方案来扩展多属性标签。

Method: 提出双模型架构：使用CNN进行细胞类型分类，使用Vision Transformer (ViT)进行多属性分类。使用两个互补数据集：PBC数据集（8种细胞类型）和WBCAtt数据集（11种形态属性）。

Result: 在WBCAtt数据集上实现了94.62%的多属性分类准确率，显著提高了模型可解释性，并相对于传统人工标注大幅提升了时间和成本效率。

Conclusion: AttriGen建立了一个新的范式，可以扩展到其他计算机视觉分类任务，通过有效自动化多属性标签的扩展。

Abstract: We introduce AttriGen, a novel framework for automated, fine-grained
multi-attribute annotation in computer vision, with a particular focus on cell
microscopy where multi-attribute classification remains underrepresented
compared to traditional cell type categorization. Using two complementary
datasets: the Peripheral Blood Cell (PBC) dataset containing eight distinct
cell types and the WBC Attribute Dataset (WBCAtt) that contains their
corresponding 11 morphological attributes, we propose a dual-model architecture
that combines a CNN for cell type classification, as well as a Vision
Transformer (ViT) for multi-attribute classification achieving a new benchmark
of 94.62\% accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that AttriGen significantly
enhances model interpretability and offers substantial time and cost efficiency
relative to conventional full-scale human annotation. Thus, our framework
establishes a new paradigm that can be extended to other computer vision
classification tasks by effectively automating the expansion of multi-attribute
labels.

Conclusion: TSalV360方法在360度视频中成功实现了文本驱动的显著性检测，为个性化视频分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the task of text-driven saliency detection in
360-degrees videos. For this, we introduce the TSV360 dataset which includes
16,000 triplets of ERP frames, textual descriptions of salient objects/events
in these frames, and the associated ground-truth saliency maps. Following, we
extend and adapt a SOTA visual-based approach for 360-degrees video saliency
detection, and develop the TSalV360 method that takes into account a
user-provided text description of the desired objects and/or events. This
method leverages a SOTA vision-language model for data representation and
integrates a similarity estimation module and a viewport spatio-temporal
cross-attention mechanism, to discover dependencies between the different data
modalities. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations using the TSV360 dataset,
showed the competitiveness of TSalV360 compared to a SOTA visual-based approach
and documented its competency to perform customized text-driven saliency
detection in 360-degrees videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GSDD方法，使用2D高斯基元进行数据集蒸馏的稀疏表示，相比传统密集像素方法更高效且可扩展


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据集蒸馏方法使用密集像素级表示，存在冗余且难以扩展，需要更高效的表示方法

Method: 使用少量高斯基元编码关键判别信息，采用CUDA-based splatting算子进行并行推理和训练

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet子集上达到最先进性能，编码解码成本高效

Conclusion: GSDD是一种简单有效、广泛适用且高度可扩展的数据集蒸馏方法

Abstract: Dataset distillation has emerged as a promising paradigm that synthesizes
compact, informative datasets capable of retaining the knowledge of large-scale
counterparts, thereby addressing the substantial computational and storage
burdens of modern model training. Conventional approaches typically rely on
dense pixel-level representations, which introduce redundancy and are difficult
to scale up. In this work, we propose GSDD, a novel and efficient sparse
representation for dataset distillation based on 2D Gaussians. Instead of
representing all pixels equally, GSDD encodes critical discriminative
information in a distilled image using only a small number of Gaussian
primitives. This sparse representation could improve dataset diversity under
the same storage budget, enhancing coverage of difficult samples and boosting
distillation performance. To ensure both efficiency and scalability, we adapt
CUDA-based splatting operators for parallel inference and training, enabling
high-quality rendering with minimal computational and memory overhead. Our
method is simple yet effective, broadly applicable to different distillation
pipelines, and highly scalable. Experiments show that GSDD achieves
state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet subsets,
while remaining highly efficient encoding and decoding cost. Our code is

Motivation: 研究旨在为视频摘要结果生成可信的文本解释，并评估这些解释与人类推理和期望的一致性，这是可解释AI的重要特性。

Method: 扩展现有视频摘要解释框架，集成LLaVA-OneVision模型生成文本描述，使用SBERT和SimCSE两种句子嵌入方法量化视觉解释与视频摘要文本描述之间的语义重叠。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了评估视频摘要解释合理性的方法，并验证了不同文本解释生成方法的有效性，为可解释AI提供了重要参考。

Abstract: In this paper, we present our experimental study on generating plausible
textual explanations for the outcomes of video summarization. For the needs of
this study, we extend an existing framework for multigranular explanation of
video summarization by integrating a SOTA Large Multimodal Model
(LLaVA-OneVision) and prompting it to produce natural language descriptions of
the obtained visual explanations. Following, we focus on one of the most
desired characteristics for explainable AI, the plausibility of the obtained
explanations that relates with their alignment with the humans' reasoning and
expectations. Using the extended framework, we propose an approach for
evaluating the plausibility of visual explanations by quantifying the semantic
overlap between their textual descriptions and the textual descriptions of the
corresponding video summaries, with the help of two methods for creating
sentence embeddings (SBERT, SimCSE). Based on the extended framework and the
proposed plausibility evaluation approach, we conduct an experimental study
using a SOTA method (CA-SUM) and two datasets (SumMe, TVSum) for video
summarization, to examine whether the more faithful explanations are also the
more plausible ones, and identify the most appropriate approach for generating
plausible textual explanations for video summarization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MGCE框架，通过多粒度概念专家解决广义类别发现问题，能够自动估计未标记数据中的类别数量，在九个细粒度视觉识别基准上取得最先进结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个主要限制：未能充分利用视觉数据中的多粒度概念信息，以及假设未标记类别数量已知，这在现实场景中不切实际。

Method: MGCE包含两个模块：动态概念对比学习（DCCL）在概念挖掘和双级表示学习之间交替进行；多粒度专家协作学习（MECL）引入不同粒度的专家并使用概念对齐矩阵进行跨专家协作。

Result: 在九个细粒度视觉识别基准上的实验表明，MGCE实现了最先进的结果，特别是在新类别准确率方面。即使没有类别数量先验知识，MGCE也优于需要知道确切类别数量的参数化方法，平均提升3.6%。

Conclusion: MGCE通过自适应挖掘视觉概念和整合多粒度知识，有效解决了广义类别发现问题，特别适合实际开放世界场景。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an open-world problem that clusters
unlabeled data by leveraging knowledge from partially labeled categories. A key
challenge is that unlabeled data may contain both known and novel categories.
Existing approaches suffer from two main limitations. First, they fail to
exploit multi-granularity conceptual information in visual data, which limits
representation quality. Second, most assume that the number of unlabeled
categories is known during training, which is impractical in real-world
scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Granularity Conceptual
Experts (MGCE) framework that adaptively mines visual concepts and integrates
multi-granularity knowledge for accurate category discovery. MGCE consists of
two modules: (1) Dynamic Conceptual Contrastive Learning (DCCL), which
alternates between concept mining and dual-level representation learning to
jointly optimize feature learning and category discovery; and (2)
Multi-Granularity Experts Collaborative Learning (MECL), which extends the
single-expert paradigm by introducing additional experts at different
granularities and by employing a concept alignment matrix for effective
cross-expert collaboration. Importantly, MGCE can automatically estimate the
number of categories in unlabeled data, making it suitable for practical
open-world settings. Extensive experiments on nine fine-grained visual
recognition benchmarks demonstrate that MGCE achieves state-of-the-art results,
particularly in novel-class accuracy. Notably, even without prior knowledge of
category numbers, MGCE outperforms parametric approaches that require knowing
the exact number of categories, with an average improvement of 3.6\%. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需额外数据或编辑操作的多模态对齐框架IMG，通过MLLM识别错位、隐式对齐器操作扩散条件特征、以及迭代更新偏好目标来实现重新生成对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型生成图像与输入提示之间的多模态对齐问题，现有方法要么需要高质量偏好数据（难以扩展），要么通过编辑局部区域可能损害整体图像质量。

Method: 1) 使用多模态大语言模型识别错位；2) 引入隐式对齐器操作扩散条件特征以减少错位并实现重新生成；3) 将重新对齐目标制定为可训练目标（迭代更新偏好目标）。

Result: 在SDXL、SDXL-DPO和FLUX上的广泛定性和定量评估显示，IMG优于现有对齐方法，并可作为灵活的即插即用适配器增强先前的基于微调的对齐方法。

Conclusion: IMG是一种有效的多模态对齐框架，无需额外数据或编辑操作，在多个扩散模型上表现出优越性能，并能增强现有对齐方法。

Abstract: Ensuring precise multimodal alignment between diffusion-generated images and
input prompts has been a long-standing challenge. Earlier works finetune
diffusion weight using high-quality preference data, which tends to be limited
and difficult to scale up. Recent editing-based methods further refine local
regions of generated images but may compromise overall image quality. In this
work, we propose Implicit Multimodal Guidance (IMG), a novel
re-generation-based multimodal alignment framework that requires no extra data
or editing operations. Specifically, given a generated image and its prompt,
IMG a) utilizes a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to identify
misalignments; b) introduces an Implicit Aligner that manipulates diffusion
conditioning features to reduce misalignments and enable re-generation; and c)
formulates the re-alignment goal into a trainable objective, namely Iteratively
Updated Preference Objective. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations on SDXL, SDXL-DPO, and FLUX show that IMG outperforms existing
alignment methods. Furthermore, IMG acts as a flexible plug-and-play adapter,
seamlessly enhancing prior finetuning-based alignment methods. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/SHI-Labs/IMG-Multimodal-Diffusion-Alignment.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型如Donut在视觉文档理解中有效但计算成本高，不适合实时或资源受限的应用场景。

Method: 利用机制可解释性分析模型内部计算，识别关键子组件，指导学生模型架构设计，通过知识蒸馏训练紧凑的学生模型。

Result: 开发的Donut-MINT模型在DocVQA基准测试中保持强性能，同时减少了推理时间和内存使用。

Conclusion: 该方法将压缩重新定义为电路发现，连接了可解释性研究和实际视觉语言模型部署。

Abstract: Recent advances in Visually-rich Document Understanding rely on large
Vision-Language Models like Donut, which perform document-level Visual Question
Answering without Optical Character Recognition. Despite their effectiveness,
these models are too costly for real-time or resource-constrained applications.
We investigate model compression through knowledge distillation, training
compact student models from a larger teacher. We leverage mechanistic
interpretability to drive student architecture design within this framework. By
analyzing internal computations, we identify essential subcomponents to retain,
while having a clear view of which subcomponents should be approximated,
skipped, or reparametrized based on their function. This approach yields
Donut-MINT (Mechanistic Interpretability-based Network Trimming), a pruned
Donut variant that reduces inference time and memory usage while maintaining
strong performance on DocVQA, a standard benchmark for document Visual Question
Answering. Our method reframes compression as circuit discovery, bridging
interpretability research and practical Vision-Language Model deployment.

<details>

Motivation: 现有LAMs存在两个瓶颈：端到端训练的视觉编码器空间理解能力差，以及输入帧间隔较远时模型脆弱导致时间感知有限，这阻碍了稳定清晰的动作建模。

Method: 提出Farsighted-LAM框架，包含几何感知空间编码和多尺度时间建模；进一步构建SSM-VLA端到端框架，集成结构化感知和视觉思维链模块来显式推理环境动态。

Result: 在仿真和真实世界的多个VLA任务上验证SSM-VLA，实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: 结合几何感知建模、时间一致性和显式推理的策略能有效增强具身智能的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Latent Action Models (LAMs) enable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems to
learn semantic action representations from large-scale unannotated data. Yet,
we identify two bottlenecks of LAMs: 1) the commonly adopted end-to-end trained
image encoder suffers from poor spatial understanding; 2) LAMs can be fragile
when input frames are distant, leading to limited temporal perception. Such
factors inevitably hinder stable and clear action modeling. To this end, we
propose Farsighted-LAM, a latent action framework with geometry-aware spatial
encoding and multi-scale temporal modeling, capturing structural priors and
dynamic motion patterns from consecutive frames. We further propose SSM-VLA, an
end-to-end VLA framework built upon Farsighted-LAM, which integrates structured
perception with a visual Chain-of-Thought module to explicitly reason about
environmental dynamics, enhancing decision consistency and interpretability. We
validate SSM-VLA on multiple VLA tasks in both simulation and real-world
settings, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our results demonstrate
that our strategy of combining geometry-aware modeling, temporal coherence, and
explicit reasoning is effective in enhancing the robustness and
generalizability of embodied intelligence.

Motivation: 合成媒体的快速发展使深度伪造检测成为在线安全和信任的关键挑战，但现有多模态大语言模型在深度伪造检测上表现不佳，其推理往往与视觉证据不一致或产生幻觉。

Method: 引入推理标注数据集，并提出段落级相对策略优化（PRPO）强化学习算法，在段落级别对齐LLM推理与图像内容。

Result: PRPO大幅提高了检测准确率，达到4.55/5.0的最高推理分数，消融研究显示PRPO在测试条件下显著优于GRPO。

Conclusion: 将多模态推理基于视觉证据对于实现更可靠和可解释的深度伪造检测至关重要。

Abstract: The rapid rise of synthetic media has made deepfake detection a critical
challenge for online safety and trust. Progress remains constrained by the
scarcity of large, high-quality datasets. Although multimodal large language
models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their performance on
deepfake detection is poor, often producing explanations that are misaligned
with visual evidence or hallucinatory. To address this limitation, we introduce
a reasoning-annotated dataset for deepfake detection and propose
Paragraph-level Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a reinforcement learning
algorithm that aligns LLM reasoning with image content at the paragraph level.
Experiments show that PRPO improves detection accuracy by a wide margin and
achieves the highest reasoning score of 4.55/5.0. Ablation studies further
demonstrate that PRPO significantly outperforms GRPO under test-time
conditions. These results underscore the importance of grounding multimodal
reasoning in visual evidence to enable more reliable and interpretable deepfake
detection.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于聚类的仿射变换(CAT)方法，用于改进低比特后训练量化(PTQ)的精度，通过使用聚类特定参数来对齐量化输出与全精度输出，无需微调模型或量化参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的仿射变换在低比特PTQ中会恶化结果，因为对所有输出使用统一的仿射参数集无法有效处理量化误差。

Method: 提出Cluster-based Affine Transformation (CAT)框架，使用聚类特定参数来精炼低比特量化输出，仅需少量额外参数。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上，该方法在多种架构和低比特设置下始终优于现有PTQ方法，在W2A2 ResNet-18上达到53.18%的Top-1准确率，并且作为插件可提升现有PTQ基线超过3%。

Conclusion: CAT是一种有效的误差减少框架，能够显著提升低比特PTQ的性能，且具有轻量级和即插即用的优势。

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) reduces the memory footprint and
computational overhead of deep neural networks by converting full-precision
(FP) values into quantized and compressed data types. While PTQ is more
cost-efficient than Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), it is highly susceptible
to accuracy degradation under a low-bit quantization (LQ) regime (e.g., 2-bit).
Affine transformation is a classical technique used to reduce the discrepancy
between the information processed by a quantized model and that processed by
its full-precision counterpart; however, we find that using plain affine
transformation, which applies a uniform affine parameter set for all outputs,
worsens the results in low-bit PTQ. To address this, we propose Cluster-based
Affine Transformation (CAT), an error-reduction framework that employs
cluster-specific parameters to align LQ outputs with FP counterparts. CAT
refines LQ outputs with only a negligible number of additional parameters,
without requiring fine-tuning of the model or quantization parameters. We
further introduce a novel PTQ framework integrated with CAT. Experiments on
ImageNet-1K show that this framework consistently outperforms prior PTQ methods
across diverse architectures and LQ settings, achieving up to 53.18% Top-1
accuracy on W2A2 ResNet-18. Moreover, CAT enhances existing PTQ baselines by
more than 3% when used as a plug-in. We plan to release our implementation
alongside the publication of this paper.

Abstract: Existing approaches to skill proficiency estimation often rely on black-box
video classifiers, ignoring multi-view context and lacking explainability. We
present ProfVLM, a compact vision-language model that reformulates this task as
generative reasoning: it jointly predicts skill level and generates expert-like

AttentiveGatedProjector that dynamically fuses multi-view features, projected
from a frozen TimeSformer backbone into a language model tuned for feedback
generation. Trained on EgoExo4D with expert commentaries, ProfVLM surpasses
state-of-the-art methods while using up to 20x fewer parameters and reducing
training time by up to 60%. Our approach not only achieves superior accuracy
across diverse activities, but also outputs natural language critiques aligned

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Point2RBox-v3提出了一种基于点标注的弱监督定向目标检测方法，通过渐进式标签分配和先验引导动态掩码损失，解决了现有方法中伪标签利用率低和质量差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的点监督方法存在两个缺陷：伪标签利用率低和伪标签质量差。为了替代成本高昂的人工标注，需要开发更有效的弱监督定向目标检测方法。

Method: 1) 渐进式标签分配(PLA)：在不同训练阶段动态估计实例尺寸，实现标签分配方法的使用；2) 先验引导动态掩码损失(PGDM-Loss)：结合SAM模型和分水岭算法优势，克服了分水岭在稀疏场景和SAM在密集场景中的性能不足。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得优异性能：DOTA-v1.0(66.09%)、DOTA-v1.5(56.86%)、DOTA-v2.0(41.28%)、DIOR(46.40%)、STAR(19.60%)、RSAR(45.96%)，特别在目标尺寸变化大或稀疏场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: Point2RBox-v3是首个使用动态伪标签进行标签分配的模型，创新性地结合了SAM模型和分水岭算法，在稀疏和密集场景中都实现了优秀性能。

Abstract: Driven by the growing need for Oriented Object Detection (OOD), learning from
point annotations under a weakly-supervised framework has emerged as a
promising alternative to costly and laborious manual labeling. In this paper,
we discuss two deficiencies in existing point-supervised methods: inefficient
utilization and poor quality of pseudo labels. Therefore, we present
Point2RBox-v3. At the core are two principles: 1) Progressive Label Assignment
(PLA). It dynamically estimates instance sizes in a coarse yet intelligent
manner at different stages of the training process, enabling the use of label
assignment methods. 2) Prior-Guided Dynamic Mask Loss (PGDM-Loss). It is an
enhancement of the Voronoi Watershed Loss from Point2RBox-v2, which overcomes
the shortcomings of Watershed in its poor performance in sparse scenes and
SAM's poor performance in dense scenes. To our knowledge, Point2RBox-v3 is the
first model to employ dynamic pseudo labels for label assignment, and it
creatively complements the advantages of SAM model with the watershed
algorithm, which achieves excellent performance in both sparse and dense
scenes. Our solution gives competitive performance, especially in scenarios
with large variations in object size or sparse object occurrences:
66.09%/56.86%/41.28%/46.40%/19.60%/45.96% on
DOTA-v1.0/DOTA-v1.5/DOTA-v2.0/DIOR/STAR/RSAR.

Motivation: 开发一个能够统一基于插拔方法和生成式逆问题求解器视角的逆问题求解框架，同时在实际应用中实现最先进的重建质量。

Method: 采用三步迭代过程：(i)流一致的目标估计，速度网络预测去噪目标；(ii)精炼步骤，将估计目标投影到前向算子定义的可行集；(iii)时间推进步骤，沿流轨迹重新投影精炼后的目标。

Result: Flower在多种逆问题上实现了最先进的重建质量，且在不同问题上使用几乎相同的超参数。

Conclusion: Flower通过理论分析证明了其近似贝叶斯后验采样的能力，统一了插拔方法和生成式逆问题求解器的视角，同时在实际应用中表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce Flower, a solver for inverse problems. It leverages a
pre-trained flow model to produce reconstructions that are consistent with the
observed measurements. Flower operates through an iterative procedure over
three steps: (i) a flow-consistent destination estimation, where the velocity
network predicts a denoised target; (ii) a refinement step that projects the
estimated destination onto a feasible set defined by the forward operator; and
(iii) a time-progression step that re-projects the refined destination along
the flow trajectory. We provide a theoretical analysis that demonstrates how
Flower approximates Bayesian posterior sampling, thereby unifying perspectives
from plug-and-play methods and generative inverse solvers. On the practical
side, Flower achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality while using
nearly identical hyperparameters across various inverse problems.

### [104] [Continuous Space-Time Video Super-Resolution with 3D Fourier Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26325)
*Alexander Becker,Julius Erbach,Dominik Narnhofer,Konrad Schindler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种连续时空视频超分辨率的新方法，使用3D视频傅里叶场表示视频，能够同时捕获空间细节和时间动态，实现任意时空位置的灵活采样和抗混叠重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将视频表示为分离的空间和时间组件，依赖脆弱的显式帧扭曲进行运动补偿，存在局限性。需要一种更统一、连续的视频表示方法。

Method: 将视频编码为连续的3D视频傅里叶场，使用神经网络预测傅里叶基系数，包含高斯点扩散函数以确保任意尺度的无混叠重建。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最新技术水平，在广泛的放大因子范围内提供更清晰、时间更一致的重建结果，同时计算效率更高。

Conclusion: 联合建模方法显著改善了空间和时间超分辨率性能，证明了连续视频表示在视频超分辨率任务中的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation for continuous space-time video
super-resolution. Instead of decoupling the representation of a video sequence
into separate spatial and temporal components and relying on brittle, explicit
frame warping for motion compensation, we encode video as a continuous,
spatio-temporally coherent 3D Video Fourier Field (VFF). That representation
offers three key advantages: (1) it enables cheap, flexible sampling at
arbitrary locations in space and time; (2) it is able to simultaneously capture
fine spatial detail and smooth temporal dynamics; and (3) it offers the
possibility to include an analytical, Gaussian point spread function in the
sampling to ensure aliasing-free reconstruction at arbitrary scale. The
coefficients of the proposed, Fourier-like sinusoidal basis are predicted with
a neural encoder with a large spatio-temporal receptive field, conditioned on
the low-resolution input video. Through extensive experiments, we show that our
joint modeling substantially improves both spatial and temporal
super-resolution and sets a new state of the art for multiple benchmarks:
across a wide range of upscaling factors, it delivers sharper and temporally
more consistent reconstructions than existing baselines, while being
computationally more efficient. Project page: https://v3vsr.github.io.

### [105] [SQUARE: Semantic Query-Augmented Fusion and Efficient Batch Reranking for Training-free Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26330)
*Ren-Di Wu,Yu-Yen Lin,Huei-Fang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SQUARE是一个无需训练的两阶段零样本组合图像检索框架，利用多模态大语言模型增强检索性能，通过语义查询增强融合和高效批量重排序来更好地捕捉用户意图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本组合图像检索方法无需特定任务训练或标注数据，但准确捕捉用户意图仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1）语义查询增强融合阶段，用MLLM生成目标图像描述来丰富查询嵌入；2）高效批量重排序阶段，将候选图像以网格形式呈现给MLLM进行联合视觉语义推理。

Result: 在四个标准CIR基准测试中表现出色，即使使用轻量级预训练模型也能保持高性能。

Conclusion: SQUARE框架简单有效，在零样本组合图像检索任务中展现了强大的性能和应用潜力。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images that preserve
the visual content of a reference image while incorporating user-specified
textual modifications. Training-free zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) approaches, which
require no task-specific training or labeled data, are highly desirable, yet
accurately capturing user intent remains challenging. In this paper, we present
SQUARE, a novel two-stage training-free framework that leverages Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance ZS-CIR. In the Semantic
Query-Augmented Fusion (SQAF) stage, we enrich the query embedding derived from
a vision-language model (VLM) such as CLIP with MLLM-generated captions of the
target image. These captions provide high-level semantic guidance, enabling the
query to better capture the user's intent and improve global retrieval quality.
In the Efficient Batch Reranking (EBR) stage, top-ranked candidates are
presented as an image grid with visual marks to the MLLM, which performs joint
visual-semantic reasoning across all candidates. Our reranking strategy
operates in a single pass and yields more accurate rankings. Experiments show
that SQUARE, with its simplicity and effectiveness, delivers strong performance
on four standard CIR benchmarks. Notably, it maintains high performance even
with lightweight pre-trained, demonstrating its potential applicability.

*Keming Wu,Sicong Jiang,Max Ku,Ping Nie,Minghao Liu,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为\mname的奖励模型，用于解决开源图像编辑模型缺乏可靠奖励模型的问题，通过大规模人工偏好数据集训练，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平，并能用于筛选高质量训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源图像编辑模型落后于闭源模型，主要瓶颈是缺乏可靠的奖励模型来扩展高质量合成训练数据。

Method: 构建\mname奖励模型，使用包含20万对偏好数据的大规模人工标注数据集进行训练，标注由训练有素的专家按照严格协议完成。

Result: \mname在指令引导的图像编辑任务中与人类偏好高度对齐，在GenAI-Bench、AURORA-Bench、ImagenHub等基准测试中达到最先进的人类相关性，优于多种VLM-as-judge模型。使用\mname筛选ShareGPT-4o-Image数据集后训练的Step1X-Edit模型性能显著提升。

Conclusion: \mname作为奖励模型能够有效扩展高质量图像编辑训练数据，其强对齐性表明在基于强化学习的后训练和图像编辑模型的测试时扩展等高级应用中具有潜力。

Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed great progress in image editing with natural
language instructions. Several closed-source models like GPT-Image-1, Seedream,
and Google-Nano-Banana have shown highly promising progress. However, the
open-source models are still lagging. The main bottleneck is the lack of a
reliable reward model to scale up high-quality synthetic training data. To
address this critical bottleneck, we built \mname, trained with our new
large-scale human preference dataset, meticulously annotated by trained experts
following a rigorous protocol containing over 200K preference pairs. \mname
demonstrates superior alignment with human preferences in instruction-guided
image editing tasks. Experiments show that \mname achieves state-of-the-art
human correlation on established benchmarks such as GenAI-Bench, AURORA-Bench,
ImagenHub, and our new \benchname, outperforming a wide range of VLM-as-judge
models. Furthermore, we use \mname to select a high-quality subset from the
existing noisy ShareGPT-4o-Image dataset. We train Step1X-Edit on the selected
subset, which shows significant improvement over training on the full set. This
demonstrates \mname's ability to serve as a reward model to scale up
high-quality training data for image editing. Furthermore, its strong alignment
suggests potential for advanced applications like reinforcement learning-based
post-training and test-time scaling of image editing models. \mname with its
training dataset will be released to help the community build more high-quality
image editing training datasets.

*Xiangrui Liu,Minghao Qin,Yan Shu,Zhengyang Liang,Yang Tian,Chen Jason Zhang,Bo Zhao,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了任务导向时序定位(ToTG)新问题，并开发了TimeScope框架，通过渐进式推理在长视频中定位关键时刻，在ToTG Bench基准测试中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在长视频中定位关键时刻时泛化能力有限且处理困难，需要新的解决方案来基于任务描述定位包含必要信息的时间区间。

Method: TimeScope框架采用渐进式推理：首先在长视频中识别可能包含关键时刻的粗粒度时间范围，然后通过细粒度时刻划分来精炼这个范围。

Result: 大量实验表明，TimeScope在各种设置下都优于现有的时序定位方法和流行的多模态大语言模型。

Conclusion: TimeScope框架有效解决了任务导向时序定位这一具有挑战性的新问题，展现了其在长视频中定位关键时刻的优越性能。

Abstract: Identifying key moments in long videos is essential for downstream
understanding and reasoning tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new problem,
Taskoriented Temporal Grounding ToTG, which aims to localize time intervals
containing the necessary information based on a task's natural description.
Along with the definition, we also present ToTG Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating the performance on ToTG. ToTG is particularly
challenging for traditional approaches due to their limited generalizability
and difficulty in handling long videos. To address these challenges, we propose
TimeScope, a novel framework built upon progressive reasoning. TimeScope first
identifies a coarse-grained temporal scope in the long video that likely
contains the key moments, and then refines this scope through finegrained
moment partitioning. Additionally, we curate a highquality dataset, namely ToTG
Pile, to enhance TimeScope's ability to perform progressive temporal grounding
effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeScope consistently
outperforms both existing temporalgrounding methods and popular MLLMs across
various settings, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing this new
challenging problem.

*Harold Haodong Chen,Xianfeng Wu,Wen-Jie Shu,Rongjin Guo,Disen Lan,Harry Yang,Ying-Cong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScalingAR是首个专为基于next-token预测的自回归图像生成设计的测试时缩放框架，无需早期解码或辅助奖励模型，通过token熵和两级缩放机制显著提升生成质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时缩放方法依赖于频繁的部分解码和外部奖励模型，不适用于基于next-token预测的自回归图像生成，因为中间解码结果不完整。需要专门针对这种场景的缩放框架。

Method: 提出ScalingAR框架，利用token熵作为视觉token生成的新信号，包含两个互补的缩放级别：Profile Level通过融合内在和条件信号来流式传输校准的置信状态；Policy Level利用该状态自适应终止低置信度轨迹并动态调度指导强度。

Result: 在通用和组合基准测试中，ScalingAR将基础模型在GenEval上提升12.5%，在TIIF-Bench上提升15.2%；高效减少62.0%的视觉token消耗同时超越基线；增强鲁棒性，在挑战性场景中缓解26.0%的性能下降。

Conclusion: ScalingAR成功填补了测试时缩放在自回归图像生成中的空白，通过创新的熵信号和两级缩放机制，在保持高质量生成的同时显著提升了效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing
large language models, yet its application to next-token prediction (NTP)
autoregressive (AR) image generation remains largely uncharted. Existing TTS
approaches for visual AR (VAR), which rely on frequent partial decoding and
external reward models, are ill-suited for NTP-based image generation due to
the inherent incompleteness of intermediate decoding results. To bridge this
gap, we introduce ScalingAR, the first TTS framework specifically designed for
NTP-based AR image generation that eliminates the need for early decoding or
auxiliary rewards. ScalingAR leverages token entropy as a novel signal in
visual token generation and operates at two complementary scaling levels: (i)
Profile Level, which streams a calibrated confidence state by fusing intrinsic
and conditional signals; and (ii) Policy Level, which utilizes this state to
adaptively terminate low-confidence trajectories and dynamically schedule
guidance for phase-appropriate conditioning strength. Experiments on both
general and compositional benchmarks show that ScalingAR (1) improves base
models by 12.5% on GenEval and 15.2% on TIIF-Bench, (2) efficiently reduces
visual token consumption by 62.0% while outperforming baselines, and (3)
successfully enhances robustness, mitigating performance drops by 26.0% in
challenging scenarios.

### [109] [PANDA: Towards Generalist Video Anomaly Detection via Agentic AI Engineer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26386)
*Zhiwei Yang,Chen Gao,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PANDA，一种基于MLLM的智能AI工程师，用于实现无需训练数据或人工干预的通用视频异常检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频异常检测方法依赖特定领域训练数据和手动调整，存在高人工成本和泛化能力有限的问题，因此需要实现能够自动处理任何场景和异常类型的通用VAD。

Method: 设计了四个关键能力：自适应的场景感知策略规划、目标驱动的启发式推理、工具增强的自我反思、自我改进的记忆链。具体包括自适应场景感知RAG机制、潜在异常引导的启发式提示策略、渐进式反思机制和上下文感知工具、记忆链机制。

Result: 在多种场景、开放集和复杂场景设置中实现了最先进的性能，无需训练和人工干预，验证了其可泛化和鲁棒的异常检测能力。

Conclusion: PANDA展示了在无需训练和人工干预的情况下实现通用视频异常检测的可行性，为VAD领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a critical yet challenging task due to the
complex and diverse nature of real-world scenarios. Previous methods typically
rely on domain-specific training data and manual adjustments when applying to
new scenarios and unseen anomaly types, suffering from high labor costs and
limited generalization. Therefore, we aim to achieve generalist VAD, i.e.,
automatically handle any scene and any anomaly types without training data or
human involvement. In this work, we propose PANDA, an agentic AI engineer based
on MLLMs. Specifically, we achieve PANDA by comprehensively devising four key
capabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning, (2) goal-driven
heuristic reasoning, (3) tool-augmented self-reflection, and (4) self-improving
chain-of-memory. Concretely, we develop a self-adaptive scene-aware RAG
mechanism, enabling PANDA to retrieve anomaly-specific knowledge for anomaly
detection strategy planning. Next, we introduce a latent anomaly-guided
heuristic prompt strategy to enhance reasoning precision. Furthermore, PANDA
employs a progressive reflection mechanism alongside a suite of context-aware
tools to iteratively refine decision-making in complex scenarios. Finally, a
chain-of-memory mechanism enables PANDA to leverage historical experiences for
continual performance improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PANDA
achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scenario, open-set, and complex
scenario settings without training and manual involvement, validating its
generalizable and robust anomaly detection capability. Code is released at

TL;DR: MotionRAG：基于检索增强的视频生成框架，通过从相关参考视频中提取运动先验来提升运动真实性，采用上下文感知运动适应技术，在多个领域和基础模型上显著改善运动生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的图像到视频生成在运动真实性方面仍面临挑战，难以准确建模复杂的物理约束、物体交互和领域特定动态。

Method: 提出检索增强框架MotionRAG，包括：基于检索的流程提取高级运动特征；上下文学习方法进行运动适应；基于注意力的运动注入适配器将运动特征集成到预训练视频扩散模型中。

Result: 在多个领域和各种基础模型上实现显著改进，推理时计算开销可忽略，模块化设计支持通过更新检索数据库实现新领域的零样本泛化。

Conclusion: 该研究通过有效检索和迁移运动先验，增强了视频生成系统的核心能力，促进了真实运动动态的合成。

Abstract: Image-to-video generation has made remarkable progress with the advancements
in diffusion models, yet generating videos with realistic motion remains highly
challenging. This difficulty arises from the complexity of accurately modeling
motion, which involves capturing physical constraints, object interactions, and
domain-specific dynamics that are not easily generalized across diverse
scenarios. To address this, we propose MotionRAG, a retrieval-augmented
framework that enhances motion realism by adapting motion priors from relevant
reference videos through Context-Aware Motion Adaptation (CAMA). The key
technical innovations include: (i) a retrieval-based pipeline extracting
high-level motion features using video encoder and specialized resamplers to
distill semantic motion representations; (ii) an in-context learning approach
for motion adaptation implemented through a causal transformer architecture;
(iii) an attention-based motion injection adapter that seamlessly integrates
transferred motion features into pretrained video diffusion models. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements
across multiple domains and various base models, all with negligible
computational overhead during inference. Furthermore, our modular design
enables zero-shot generalization to new domains by simply updating the
retrieval database without retraining any components. This research enhances
the core capability of video generation systems by enabling the effective
retrieval and transfer of motion priors, facilitating the synthesis of
realistic motion dynamics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图像难度感知的超分辨率模型评估方法，通过高频指数和旋转不变边缘指数来预测模型在不同难度图像上的表现差异，解决了传统平均评分无法反映模型在困难图像上性能的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超分辨率模型评估使用平均分数，无法反映模型在不同难度图像上的表现差异，特别是某些模型在困难图像上会产生伪影，但平均分数无法体现这些视觉差异。

Method: 提出了两种图像难度度量：高频指数和旋转不变边缘指数，用于预测测试图像中模型之间视觉结果的显著差异，并开发了一种评估方法将这些视觉差异反映在客观度量上。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的图像难度度量和评估方法能够有效区分在平均性能接近但视觉结果不同的超分辨率模型。

Conclusion: 提出的难度感知性能评估程序能够更好地区分产生不同视觉结果的超分辨率模型，解决了传统平均评分方法的局限性。

Abstract: Image super-resolution models are commonly evaluated by average scores (over
some benchmark test sets), which fail to reflect the performance of these
models on images of varying difficulty and that some models generate artifacts
on certain difficult images, which is not reflected by the average scores. We
propose difficulty-aware performance evaluation procedures to better
differentiate between SISR models that produce visually different results on
some images but yield close average performance scores over the entire test
set. In particular, we propose two image-difficulty measures, the
high-frequency index and rotation-invariant edge index, to predict those test
images, where a model would yield significantly better visual results over
another model, and an evaluation method where these visual differences are
reflected on objective measures. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed image-difficulty measures and evaluation
methodology.

TL;DR: 提出PRISM框架，通过三阶段渐进式网络（CENet、SFNet、RNet）进行图像去雨，结合混合注意力UNet和混合域Mamba模型，在多个数据集上取得竞争性结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前单尺度模型在细粒度恢复和全局一致性方面存在困难，需要解决图像去雨任务中的多尺度特征聚合和细节保持问题。

Method: 使用三阶段渐进框架：CENet进行粗提取，SFNet结合HA-UNet和HDMamba进行频率融合，RNet进行细粒度结构恢复。HA-UNet结合通道注意力和窗口空间变换器，HDMamba联合建模空间语义和小波域特征。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得了竞争性的去雨结果，能够学习高频雨特征同时保持结构细节和全局上下文。

Conclusion: PRISM框架通过渐进式三阶段设计和混合域建模，有效解决了图像去雨中的多尺度特征聚合问题，提升了图像质量。

Abstract: Image deraining is an essential vision technique that removes rain streaks
and water droplets, enhancing clarity for critical vision tasks like autonomous
driving. However, current single-scale models struggle with fine-grained
recovery and global consistency. To address this challenge, we propose
Progressive Rain removal with Integrated State-space Modeling (PRISM), a
progressive three-stage framework: Coarse Extraction Network (CENet), Frequency
Fusion Network (SFNet), and Refine Network (RNet). Specifically, CENet and
SFNet utilize a novel Hybrid Attention UNet (HA-UNet) for multi-scale feature
aggregation by combining channel attention with windowed spatial transformers.
Moreover, we propose Hybrid Domain Mamba (HDMamba) for SFNet to jointly model
spatial semantics and wavelet domain characteristics. Finally, RNet recovers
the fine-grained structures via an original-resolution subnetwork. Our model
learns high-frequency rain characteristics while preserving structural details
and maintaining global context, leading to improved image quality. Our method
achieves competitive results on multiple datasets against recent deraining
methods.

*Donghoon Kim,Dongyoung Lee,Ik Joon Chang,Sung-Ho Bae*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出QuaRTZ方法，通过残差截断和零抑制实现扩散模型的4位量化，在保持纹理细节的同时显著降低计算需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然能生成高质量图像，但计算需求高，部署困难。现有的8位量化方法效果良好，但扩展到4位量化面临挑战，因为更大的步长会放大低幅度激活值的舍入误差，导致细粒度纹理丢失。

Method: QuaRTZ方法结合8位最小-最大量化处理异常值，并通过前导零抑制压缩到4位以保留最低有效位(LSB)，从而保持纹理细节。该方法平衡了异常值保留和LSB精度，减少舍入误差并提高量化效率。

Result: 在FLUX.1-schnell上，4位QuaRTZ实现了6.98的FID分数，优于需要辅助FP16分支的SVDQuant方法。

Conclusion: QuaRTZ通过理论推导和实证评估证明了其在各种激活分布上的通用性，为扩散模型的高效部署提供了有效的4位量化解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but face deployment
challenges due to their high computational requirements. Although 8-bit
outlier-aware post-training quantization (PTQ) matches full-precision
performance, extending PTQ to 4 bits remains challenging. Larger step sizes in
4-bit quantization amplify rounding errors in dense, low-magnitude activations,
leading to the loss of fine-grained textures. We hypothesize that not only
outliers but also small activations are critical for texture fidelity. To this
end, we propose Quantization via Residual Truncation and Zero Suppression
(QuaRTZ), a 4-bit PTQ scheme for diffusion models. QuaRTZ applies 8-bit min-max
quantization for outlier handling and compresses to 4 bits via leading-zero
suppression to retain LSBs, thereby preserving texture details. Our approach
reduces rounding errors and improves quantization efficiency by balancing
outlier preservation and LSB precision. Both theoretical derivations and
empirical evaluations demonstrate the generalizability of QuaRTZ across diverse
activation distributions. Notably, 4-bit QuaRTZ achieves an FID of 6.98 on
FLUX.1-schnell, outperforming SVDQuant that requires auxiliary FP16 branches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代生产线需要确保每辆车都符合正确的变体规格且无可见缺陷，这是一个日益复杂的挑战。

Method: 使用11个同步摄像头捕获车辆360度视图，将任务特定视图路由到专门模块：YOLOv8用于零件检测、EfficientNet用于ICE/EV分类、Gemini-1.5 Flash用于徽标OCR、YOLOv8-Seg用于划痕和凹陷分割。通过视图感知融合层标准化证据，VIN条件规则引擎将检测特征与预期清单进行比较。

Result: 在混合数据集上，AVI实现了93%的验证准确率、86%的缺陷检测召回率，并维持每分钟3.3辆车的处理速度，大幅超越单视图或无分割基线。

Conclusion: 这是首个公开报道的统一多摄像头特征验证与缺陷检测的可部署汽车行业系统。

Abstract: Ensuring that every vehicle leaving a modern production line is built to the
correct \emph{variant} specification and is free from visible defects is an
increasingly complex challenge. We present the \textbf{Automated Vehicle
Inspection (AVI)} platform, an end-to-end, \emph{multi-view} perception system
that couples deep-learning detectors with a semantic rule engine to deliver
\emph{variant-aware} quality control in real time. Eleven synchronized cameras
capture a full 360{\deg} sweep of each vehicle; task-specific views are then
routed to specialised modules: YOLOv8 for part detection, EfficientNet for
ICE/EV classification, Gemini-1.5 Flash for mascot OCR, and YOLOv8-Seg for
scratch-and-dent segmentation. A view-aware fusion layer standardises evidence,
while a VIN-conditioned rule engine compares detected features against the
expected manifest, producing an interpretable pass/fail report in \(\approx\!
300\,\text{ms}\). On a mixed data set of Original Equipment Manufacturer(OEM)
vehicle data sets of four distinct models plus public scratch/dent images, AVI
achieves \textbf{ 93 \%} verification accuracy, \textbf{86 \%} defect-detection
recall, and sustains \(\mathbf{3.3}\) vehicles/min, surpassing single-view or
no segmentation baselines by large margins. To our knowledge, this is the first
publicly reported system that unifies multi-camera feature validation with
defect detection in a deployable automotive setting in industry.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stylos是一个单次前向传播的3D高斯框架，用于从单张图像到多视角集合的无姿态内容3D风格迁移，通过参考风格图像实现几何感知、视角一致的风格化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统3D风格迁移需要逐场景优化或预计算姿态的问题，实现无需优化、无需姿态的零样本3D风格迁移，并能泛化到未见过的类别、场景和风格。

Method: 采用Transformer主干网络，包含两条路径：几何预测路径使用自注意力保持几何保真度，风格注入路径通过全局交叉注意力确保视角间视觉一致性，并引入基于体素的3D风格损失来对齐场景特征与风格统计量。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，Stylos能够实现高质量的零样本风格化，验证了全局风格-内容耦合、3D风格损失的有效性，以及从单视角到大规模多视角设置的可扩展性。

Conclusion: Stylos通过创新的架构设计和损失函数，成功实现了无需优化、无需姿态的3D风格迁移，在保持几何完整性的同时实现了视角一致的风格化效果。

Abstract: We present Stylos, a single-forward 3D Gaussian framework for 3D style
transfer that operates on unposed content, from a single image to a multi-view
collection, conditioned on a separate reference style image. Stylos synthesizes
a stylized 3D Gaussian scene without per-scene optimization or precomputed
poses, achieving geometry-aware, view-consistent stylization that generalizes
to unseen categories, scenes, and styles. At its core, Stylos adopts a
Transformer backbone with two pathways: geometry predictions retain
self-attention to preserve geometric fidelity, while style is injected via
global cross-attention to enforce visual consistency across views. With the
addition of a voxel-based 3D style loss that aligns aggregated scene features
to style statistics, Stylos enforces view-consistent stylization while
preserving geometry. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that
Stylos delivers high-quality zero-shot stylization, highlighting the
effectiveness of global style-content coupling, the proposed 3D style loss, and
the scalability of our framework from single view to large-scale multi-view
settings.

Motivation: 室内场景分类在计算机视觉中至关重要，特别是在敏感内容分析如儿童性虐待图像分类方面。传统方法面临物体间复杂关系和空间布局的挑战。

Method: 将图像转换为场景图，然后使用图注意力网络进行推理，直接建模场景组件之间的交互关系。

Abstract: Indoor scene classification is a critical task in computer vision, with
wide-ranging applications that go from robotics to sensitive content analysis,
such as child sexual abuse imagery (CSAI) classification. The problem is
particularly challenging due to the intricate relationships between objects and
complex spatial layouts. In this work, we propose the Attention over Scene
Graphs for Sensitive Content Analysis (ASGRA), a novel framework that operates
on structured graph representations instead of raw pixels. By first converting
images into Scene Graphs and then employing a Graph Attention Network for
inference, ASGRA directly models the interactions between a scene's components.
This approach offers two key benefits: (i) inherent explainability via object
and relationship identification, and (ii) privacy preservation, enabling model
training without direct access to sensitive images. On Places8, we achieve
81.27% balanced accuracy, surpassing image-based methods. Real-world CSAI
evaluation with law enforcement yields 74.27% balanced accuracy. Our results
establish structured scene representations as a robust paradigm for indoor
scene classification and CSAI classification. Code is publicly available at

*Sumaiya Tabassum,Md. Faysal Ahamed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级CBAM-CNN模型用于槟榔叶病害分类，该模型仅含213万参数，通过集成注意力机制提升特征提取能力，在包含10,185张图像的增强数据集上取得了95.58%的准确率。

Conclusion: 提出的轻量级CBAM-CNN模型在槟榔叶病害分类中表现出色，为植物病害智能检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Betel leaf is an important crop because of its economic advantages and
widespread use. Its betel vines are susceptible to a number of illnesses that
are commonly referred to as betel leaf disease. Plant diseases are the largest
threat to the food supply's security, and they are challenging to identify in
time to stop possible financial damage. Interestingly, artificial intelligence
can leave a big mark on the betel leaf industry since it helps with output
growth by forecasting sickness. This paper presents a lightweight CBAM-CNN
model with just 2.13 million parameters (8.13 MB), incorporating CBAM
(Convolutional Block Attention Module) to improve feature emphasis without
depending on heavy pre-trained networks. The model's capacity to discern minute
variations among leaf disease classes is improved by the integrated attention
mechanism, which allows it to adaptively focus on significant spatial and
channel-wise information. In order to ensure class balance and diversity for
efficient model training and validation, this work makes use of an enriched
dataset of 10,185 images divided into three categories: Healthy Leaf, Leaf Rot,
and Leaf Spot. The proposed model achieved a precision of 97%, recall of 94%,
and F1 score of 95%, and 95.58% accuracy on the test set demonstrating strong
and balanced classification performance outperforming traditional pre trained
CNN models. The model's focus regions were visualized and interpreted using
Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping), an explainable AI
technique.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种从用户移动轨迹重建空间布局（如家庭平面图）的逆问题求解方法，使用扩散模型的后验采样器，并通过对比学习在嵌入空间中重新定义似然分数来解决传统方法的不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接从移动轨迹重建空间布局是一个不适定问题，因为多个平面图可能对应相同的移动轨迹。传统方法由于路径规划过程的不可逆和不可微特性，在优化似然分数时存在不稳定性。

Method: 采用基于扩散的后验采样器，在对比学习训练的嵌入空间中重新定义似然分数，使兼容的平面图和轨迹在嵌入空间中靠近，不匹配的则远离，从而稳定地引导去噪过程。

Result: 实验表明，CoGuide模型能够从轨迹生成更一致的平面图，比可微分规划器基线和引导扩散方法更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过在嵌入空间中定义代理似然分数，可以有效解决逆问题中的不适定性和优化不稳定性，实现从移动轨迹到空间布局的可靠重建。

Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing the spatial layout of a
place, a home floorplan for example, from a user`s movements inside that
layout. Direct inversion is ill-posed since many floorplans can explain the
same movement trajectories. We adopt a diffusion-based posterior sampler to
generate layouts consistent with the measurements. While active research is in
progress on generative inverse solvers, we find that the forward operator in
our problem poses new challenges. The path-planning process inside a floorplan
is a non-invertible, non-differentiable function, and causes instability while
optimizing using the likelihood score. We break-away from existing approaches
and reformulate the likelihood score in a smoother embedding space. The
embedding space is trained with a contrastive loss which brings compatible
floorplans and trajectories close to each other, while pushing mismatched pairs
far apart. We show that a surrogate form of the likelihood score in this
embedding space is a valid approximation of the true likelihood score, making
it possible to steer the denoising process towards the posterior. Across
extensive experiments, our model CoGuide produces more consistent floorplans
from trajectories, and is more robust than differentiable-planner baselines and
guided-diffusion methods.

Motivation: 大语言模型计算成本高，不适合资源受限的边缘环境，而预训练后的小模型性能不足，需要高效提升小模型在复杂任务中的表现。

Method: 采用课程式监督微调(SFT)和离线策略知识蒸馏的后训练流程，专门针对边缘设备优化。

Result: 生成的指令调优模型在十亿参数模型中达到最先进性能，在严格硬件约束下表现出强泛化能力，并在多种任务中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 为昇腾边缘设备开发高性能语言模型提供了实用高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
advanced the capabilities of artificial intelligence across various domains.
However, their massive scale and high computational costs render them
unsuitable for direct deployment in resource-constrained edge environments.
This creates a critical need for high-performance small models that can operate
efficiently at the edge. Yet, after pre-training alone, these smaller models
often fail to meet the performance requirements of complex tasks. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a systematic post-training pipeline that efficiently
enhances small model accuracy. Our post training pipeline consists of
curriculum-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and offline on-policy knowledge
distillation. The resulting instruction-tuned model achieves state-of-the-art
performance among billion-parameter models, demonstrating strong generalization
under strict hardware constraints while maintaining competitive accuracy across
a variety of tasks. This work provides a practical and efficient solution for
developing high-performance language models on Ascend edge devices.

TL;DR: DEPTHOR++是一个针对噪声dToF输入的深度补全框架，通过模拟训练、异常检测和专门网络设计，显著提升了深度感知的鲁棒性和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度补全方法假设理想dToF输入和完美对齐，忽略了实际应用中的校准误差和异常，限制了真实世界适用性。

Method: 提出三方面改进：基于合成数据的模拟训练方法、无学习参数异常检测机制、针对噪声dToF输入的深度补全网络，结合RGB图像和单目深度估计先验。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得SOTA性能：ZJU-L5数据集RMSE和Rel分别提升22%和11%；Mirror3D-NYU数据集镜面区域提升37%；Hammer数据集超越L515测量结果22%。

Conclusion: 该方法能显著提升低成本传感器的性能，使其超越高端设备，在真实世界应用中具有良好有效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Depth enhancement, which converts raw dToF signals into dense depth maps
using RGB guidance, is crucial for improving depth perception in high-precision
tasks such as 3D reconstruction and SLAM. However, existing methods often
assume ideal dToF inputs and perfect dToF-RGB alignment, overlooking
calibration errors and anomalies, thus limiting real-world applicability. This
work systematically analyzes the noise characteristics of real-world
lightweight dToF sensors and proposes a practical and novel depth completion
framework, DEPTHOR++, which enhances robustness to noisy dToF inputs from three
key aspects. First, we introduce a simulation method based on synthetic
datasets to generate realistic training samples for robust model training.
Second, we propose a learnable-parameter-free anomaly detection mechanism to
identify and remove erroneous dToF measurements, preventing misleading
propagation during completion. Third, we design a depth completion network
tailored to noisy dToF inputs, which integrates RGB images and pre-trained
monocular depth estimation priors to improve depth recovery in challenging
regions. On the ZJU-L5 dataset and real-world samples, our training strategy
significantly boosts existing depth completion models, with our model achieving
state-of-the-art performance, improving RMSE and Rel by 22% and 11% on average.
On the Mirror3D-NYU dataset, by incorporating the anomaly detection method, our
model improves upon the previous SOTA by 37% in mirror regions. On the Hammer
dataset, using simulated low-cost dToF data from RealSense L515, our method
surpasses the L515 measurements with an average gain of 22%, demonstrating its
potential to enable low-cost sensors to outperform higher-end devices.
Qualitative results across diverse real-world datasets further validate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型和基准测试未能捕捉专业视频生成的复杂性和需求，需要建立面向专业电影制作的结构化评估框架。

Method: 构建了包含76个控制节点的四个分类法，开发了自动化的提示分类和问题生成流程，进行了大规模人类研究（10+模型、20K视频、80+电影专业人士标注）。

Result: 即使最强的现有模型在Events和Camera相关控制方面仍存在显著差距，训练出的自动评估器优于现有零样本基线。

Conclusion: SCINE是首个将专业视频生成置于视频生成模型背景下的方法，通过以电影控制为中心的分类法和结构化评估流程指导未来研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have enabled high-fidelity video
synthesis from user provided prompts. However, existing models and benchmarks
fail to capture the complexity and requirements of professional video
generation. Towards that goal, we introduce Stable Cinemetrics, a structured
evaluation framework that formalizes filmmaking controls into four
disentangled, hierarchical taxonomies: Setup, Event, Lighting, and Camera.
Together, these taxonomies define 76 fine-grained control nodes grounded in
industry practices. Using these taxonomies, we construct a benchmark of prompts
aligned with professional use cases and develop an automated pipeline for
prompt categorization and question generation, enabling independent evaluation
of each control dimension. We conduct a large-scale human study spanning 10+
models and 20K videos, annotated by a pool of 80+ film professionals. Our
analysis, both coarse and fine-grained reveal that even the strongest current
models exhibit significant gaps, particularly in Events and Camera-related
controls. To enable scalable evaluation, we train an automatic evaluator, a
vision-language model aligned with expert annotations that outperforms existing
zero-shot baselines. SCINE is the first approach to situate professional video
generation within the landscape of video generative models, introducing
taxonomies centered around cinematic controls and supporting them with
structured evaluation pipelines and detailed analyses to guide future research.

Conclusion: 机器学习方法能显著降低连接组学中的人工校对成本，为大规模和比较连接组学研究提供可行性

Abstract: Producing connectomes from electron microscopy (EM) images has historically
required a great deal of human proofreading effort. This manual annotation cost
is the current bottleneck in scaling EM connectomics, for example, in making
larger connectome reconstructions feasible, or in enabling comparative
connectomics where multiple related reconstructions are produced. In this work,
we propose using the available ground-truth data generated by this manual
annotation effort to learn a machine learning model to automate or optimize
parts of the required proofreading workflows. We validate our approach on a
recent complete reconstruction of the \emph{Drosophila} male central nervous
system. We first show our method would allow for obtaining 90\% of the value of
a guided proofreading workflow while reducing required cost by 80\%. We then
demonstrate a second application for automatically merging many segmentation
fragments to proofread neurons. Our system is able to automatically attach 200
thousand fragments, equivalent to four proofreader years of manual work, and
increasing the connectivity completion rate of the connectome by 1.3\% points.

TL;DR: DiffCamera是一个基于扩散变换器的模型，能够根据任意新的焦点和模糊级别对已拍摄图像进行灵活重新对焦，解决了传统景深效果固定且难以修改的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统摄影中的景深效果一旦创建就难以修改，当主体失焦时会产生问题。需要一种能够灵活调整图像对焦点和模糊程度的方法。

Method: 设计了扩散变换器框架进行重新对焦学习，使用模拟数据生成大规模图像对，并提出堆叠约束来增强训练，确保物理上准确的景深操作。

Result: DiffCamera能够在各种场景中稳定地进行重新对焦，为摄影和生成AI应用提供了前所未有的景深调整控制能力。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了对已创建图像的灵活景深控制，通过物理基础的约束确保了准确的重新对焦效果。

Abstract: The depth-of-field (DoF) effect, which introduces aesthetically pleasing
blur, enhances photographic quality but is fixed and difficult to modify once
the image has been created. This becomes problematic when the applied blur is
undesirable~(e.g., the subject is out of focus). To address this, we propose
DiffCamera, a model that enables flexible refocusing of a created image
conditioned on an arbitrary new focus point and a blur level. Specifically, we
design a diffusion transformer framework for refocusing learning. However, the
training requires pairs of data with different focus planes and bokeh levels in
the same scene, which are hard to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we
develop a simulation-based pipeline to generate large-scale image pairs with
varying focus planes and bokeh levels. With the simulated data, we find that
training with only a vanilla diffusion objective often leads to incorrect DoF
behaviors due to the complexity of the task. This requires a stronger
constraint during training. Inspired by the photographic principle that photos
of different focus planes can be linearly blended into a multi-focus image, we
propose a stacking constraint during training to enforce precise DoF
manipulation. This constraint enhances model training by imposing physically
grounded refocusing behavior that the focusing results should be faithfully
aligned with the scene structure and the camera conditions so that they can be
combined into the correct multi-focus image. We also construct a benchmark to
evaluate the effectiveness of our refocusing model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DiffCamera supports stable refocusing across a wide range of
scenes, providing unprecedented control over DoF adjustments for photography
and generative AI applications.

Motivation: 现有多模态音频生成模型缺乏精确的用户控制，无法针对特定对象生成声音，限制了在专业Foley工作流程中的应用

Method: 引入视频对象分割感知音频生成任务，使用SAGANet模型结合视觉分割掩码、视频和文本线索进行可控声音合成

Result: 相比现有最先进方法有显著改进，为可控、高保真Foley合成设定了新标准

Conclusion: SAGANet通过对象级分割实现了细粒度的音频控制，并发布了Segmented Music Solos基准数据集推动分割感知Foley研究

Abstract: Existing multimodal audio generation models often lack precise user control,
which limits their applicability in professional Foley workflows. In
particular, these models focus on the entire video and do not provide precise
methods for prioritizing a specific object within a scene, generating
unnecessary background sounds, or focusing on the wrong objects. To address
this gap, we introduce the novel task of video object segmentation-aware audio
generation, which explicitly conditions sound synthesis on object-level
segmentation maps. We present SAGANet, a new multimodal generative model that
enables controllable audio generation by leveraging visual segmentation masks
along with video and textual cues. Our model provides users with fine-grained
and visually localized control over audio generation. To support this task and
further research on segmentation-aware Foley, we propose Segmented Music Solos,
a benchmark dataset of musical instrument performance videos with segmentation
information. Our method demonstrates substantial improvements over current
state-of-the-art methods and sets a new standard for controllable,
high-fidelity Foley synthesis. Code, samples, and Segmented Music Solos are

Conclusion: 降维不仅是预处理步骤，更是提升特征质量和分类性能的关键组成部分

Abstract: Facial expression classification remains a challenging task due to the high
dimensionality and inherent complexity of facial image data. This paper
presents Hy-Facial, a hybrid feature extraction framework that integrates both
deep learning and traditional image processing techniques, complemented by a
systematic investigation of dimensionality reduction strategies. The proposed
method fuses deep features extracted from the Visual Geometry Group 19-layer
network (VGG19) with handcrafted local descriptors and the scale-invariant
feature transform (SIFT) and Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) algorithms,
to obtain rich and diverse image representations. To mitigate feature
redundancy and reduce computational complexity, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of dimensionality reduction techniques and feature extraction. Among
these, UMAP is identified as the most effective, preserving both local and
global structures of the high-dimensional feature space. The Hy-Facial pipeline
integrated VGG19, SIFT, and ORB for feature extraction, followed by K-means
clustering and UMAP for dimensionality reduction, resulting in a classification
accuracy of 83. 3\% in the facial expression recognition (FER) dataset. These
findings underscore the pivotal role of dimensionality reduction not only as a
pre-processing step but as an essential component in improving feature quality
and overall classification performance.

Motivation: 解决全景深度估计中由于数据稀缺导致的零样本泛化能力差，以及球面畸变带来的效率低下问题。

Method: 1) 开发数据增强引擎，从透视图像生成高质量全景深度数据，创建约607K全景RGB-深度对；2) 提出SphereViT，利用球面坐标强制全景图像特征保持球面几何一致性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的综合基准测试显示，DA²在AbsRel指标上比最强的零样本基线平均提升38%，甚至优于先前的域内方法，且作为端到端解决方案效率更高。

Conclusion: DA²通过大规模数据增强和球面几何一致性建模，实现了全景深度估计的准确、高效和强零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Panorama has a full FoV (360$^\circ\times$180$^\circ$), offering a more
complete visual description than perspective images. Thanks to this
characteristic, panoramic depth estimation is gaining increasing traction in 3D
vision. However, due to the scarcity of panoramic data, previous methods are
often restricted to in-domain settings, leading to poor zero-shot
generalization. Furthermore, due to the spherical distortions inherent in
panoramas, many approaches rely on perspective splitting (e.g., cubemaps),
which leads to suboptimal efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose
$\textbf{DA}$$^{\textbf{2}}$: $\textbf{D}$epth $\textbf{A}$nything in
$\textbf{A}$ny $\textbf{D}$irection, an accurate, zero-shot generalizable, and
fully end-to-end panoramic depth estimator. Specifically, for scaling up
panoramic data, we introduce a data curation engine for generating high-quality
panoramic depth data from perspective, and create $\sim$543K panoramic
RGB-depth pairs, bringing the total to $\sim$607K. To further mitigate the
spherical distortions, we present SphereViT, which explicitly leverages
spherical coordinates to enforce the spherical geometric consistency in
panoramic image features, yielding improved performance. A comprehensive
benchmark on multiple datasets clearly demonstrates DA$^{2}$'s SoTA
performance, with an average 38% improvement on AbsRel over the strongest
zero-shot baseline. Surprisingly, DA$^{2}$ even outperforms prior in-domain
methods, highlighting its superior zero-shot generalization. Moreover, as an
end-to-end solution, DA$^{2}$ exhibits much higher efficiency over fusion-based
approaches. Both the code and the curated panoramic data will be released.

TL;DR: HART是一个用于稀疏视角人体重建的统一框架，能够从少量未标定RGB图像中输出水密着装网格、对齐的SMPL-X人体网格和高斯泼溅表示，实现照片级真实感的新视角渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么优化参数化模板而忽略宽松衣物和人物交互，要么在简化相机假设下训练隐式函数，限制了在真实场景中的应用。

Method: 预测逐像素3D点图、法线和身体对应关系，采用遮挡感知的泊松重建恢复完整几何，并与参数化SMPL-X身体模型对齐，然后用人体对齐网格初始化高斯泼溅。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得SOTA结果：着装网格重建的Chamfer距离提升18-23%，SMPL-X估计的PA-V2V降低6-27%，新视角合成的LPIPS减少15-27%。

Conclusion: 前馈transformer可作为在真实世界设置中实现鲁棒人体重建的可扩展模型。

Abstract: We introduce HART, a unified framework for sparse-view human reconstruction.
Given a small set of uncalibrated RGB images of a person as input, it outputs a
watertight clothed mesh, the aligned SMPL-X body mesh, and a Gaussian-splat
representation for photorealistic novel-view rendering. Prior methods for
clothed human reconstruction either optimize parametric templates, which
overlook loose garments and human-object interactions, or train implicit
functions under simplified camera assumptions, limiting applicability in real
scenes. In contrast, HART predicts per-pixel 3D point maps, normals, and body
correspondences, and employs an occlusion-aware Poisson reconstruction to
recover complete geometry, even in self-occluded regions. These predictions
also align with a parametric SMPL-X body model, ensuring that reconstructed
geometry remains consistent with human structure while capturing loose clothing
and interactions. These human-aligned meshes initialize Gaussian splats to
further enable sparse-view rendering. While trained on only 2.3K synthetic
scans, HART achieves state-of-the-art results: Chamfer Distance improves by
18-23 percent for clothed-mesh reconstruction, PA-V2V drops by 6-27 percent for
SMPL-X estimation, LPIPS decreases by 15-27 percent for novel-view synthesis on
a wide range of datasets. These results suggest that feed-forward transformers
can serve as a scalable model for robust human reconstruction in real-world
settings. Code and models will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了第一个SIM(3)-等变形状补全网络，通过架构设计使模型对姿态和尺度保持不变，在去偏评估协议下显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D形状补全方法通常假设扫描已预对齐到规范坐标系，这导致网络可能利用姿态和尺度线索而非推断内在几何结构。当真实数据缺乏这种对齐时，性能会崩溃。

Method: 设计SIM(3)-等变形状补全网络，其模块化层依次规范化特征、在相似性不变几何上推理，并恢复原始坐标系。

Result: 在去偏评估协议下，模型在PCN基准上优于等变和增强基线方法；在真实驾驶和室内扫描上创下跨域记录，KITTI上最小匹配距离降低17%，OmniObject3D上Chamfer距离降低14%。

Conclusion: 完整的SIM(3)等变性是实现真正可泛化形状补全的有效途径，即使在更严格的协议下仍优于有偏设置下的竞争对手。

Abstract: 3D shape completion methods typically assume scans are pre-aligned to a
canonical frame. This leaks pose and scale cues that networks may exploit to
memorize absolute positions rather than inferring intrinsic geometry. When such
alignment is absent in real data, performance collapses. We argue that robust
generalization demands architectural equivariance to the similarity group,
SIM(3), so the model remains agnostic to pose and scale. Following this
principle, we introduce the first SIM(3)-equivariant shape completion network,
whose modular layers successively canonicalize features, reason over
similarity-invariant geometry, and restore the original frame. Under a
de-biased evaluation protocol that removes the hidden cues, our model
outperforms both equivariant and augmentation baselines on the PCN benchmark.
It also sets new cross-domain records on real driving and indoor scans,
lowering minimal matching distance on KITTI by 17% and Chamfer distance $\ell1$
on OmniObject3D by 14%. Perhaps surprisingly, ours under the stricter protocol
still outperforms competitors under their biased settings. These results
establish full SIM(3) equivariance as an effective route to truly generalizable
shape completion. Project page: https://sime-completion.github.io.

*Anusha Krishnan,Shaohui Liu,Paul-Edouard Sarlin,Oscar Gentilhomme,David Caruso,Maurizio Monge,Richard Newcombe,Jakob Engel,Marc Pollefeys*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的视觉惯性SLAM数据集和基准测试，专注于可穿戴设备的第一人称视角数据，包含城市规模、厘米级精度的轨迹标注，用于评估SLAM系统在挑战性场景下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SLAM基准测试无法充分反映可穿戴设备面临的挑战，如多样化的运动模式、动态视觉内容、长时间运行导致的传感器校准变化等，且缺乏足够精确的地面真值姿态。

Method: 使用眼镜式设备记录城市中心的多小时、多公里轨迹，配备多种传感器；利用测量工具获取控制点作为间接姿态标注，实现城市规模、厘米级精度的姿态估计。

Result: 实验表明，当前最先进的学术SLAM系统无法应对这些挑战性场景，识别出了导致性能下降的关键组件。

Conclusion: 该数据集和基准测试为评估SLAM系统在真实世界挑战性场景下的性能提供了重要工具，有助于推动SLAM技术的进一步发展。

Abstract: Precise 6-DoF simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) from onboard
sensors is critical for wearable devices capturing egocentric data, which
exhibits specific challenges, such as a wider diversity of motions and
viewpoints, prevalent dynamic visual content, or long sessions affected by
time-varying sensor calibration. While recent progress on SLAM has been swift,
academic research is still driven by benchmarks that do not reflect these
challenges or do not offer sufficiently accurate ground truth poses. In this
paper, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for visual-inertial SLAM with
egocentric, multi-modal data. We record hours and kilometers of trajectories
through a city center with glasses-like devices equipped with various sensors.
We leverage surveying tools to obtain control points as indirect pose
annotations that are metric, centimeter-accurate, and available at city scale.
This makes it possible to evaluate extreme trajectories that involve walking at
night or traveling in a vehicle. We show that state-of-the-art systems
developed by academia are not robust to these challenges and we identify
components that are responsible for this. In addition, we design tracks with
different levels of difficulty to ease in-depth analysis and evaluation of less
mature approaches. The dataset and benchmark are available at

*Yuxin Song,Wenkai Dong,Shizun Wang,Qi Zhang,Song Xue,Tao Yuan,Hu Yang,Haocheng Feng,Hang Zhou,Xinyan Xiao,Jingdong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Query-Kontext方法，通过多模态"kontext"桥接VLM和扩散模型，将多模态生成推理能力委托给VLM，同时保留扩散模型的高质量视觉合成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前统一多模态模型中，多模态生成推理能力与高保真合成能力内在纠缠，需要解耦这两种能力以实现更好的性能。

Method: 使用多模态kontext（语义线索和粗粒度图像条件）连接VLM和扩散模型，采用三阶段渐进训练策略：先连接轻量扩散头，再扩展到预训练扩散模型，最后引入低级图像编码器进行指令调优。

Result: 实验表明该方法与强统一基线相当，在某些情况下甚至优于任务特定的最先进方法。

Conclusion: Query-Kontext成功解耦了多模态生成推理和视觉合成，为统一多模态模型提供了更有效的架构设计。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation (T2I) and editing (TI2I), whether instantiated as
assembled unified frameworks which couple powerful vision-language model (VLM)
with diffusion-based generator, or as naive Unified Multimodal Models with an
early fusion of understanding and generation modalities. We contend that in
current unified frameworks, the crucial capability of multimodal generative
reasoning which encompasses instruction understanding, grounding, and image
referring for identity preservation and faithful reconstruction, is
intrinsically entangled with high-fidelity synthesis. In this work, we
introduce Query-Kontext, a novel approach that bridges the VLM and diffusion
model via a multimodal ``kontext'' composed of semantic cues and coarse-grained
image conditions encoded from multimodal inputs. This design delegates the
complex ability of multimodal generative reasoning to powerful VLM while
reserving diffusion model's role for high-quality visual synthesis. To achieve
this, we propose a three-stage progressive training strategy. First, we connect
the VLM to a lightweight diffusion head via multimodal kontext tokens to
unleash the VLM's generative reasoning ability. Second, we scale this head to a
large, pre-trained diffusion model to enhance visual detail and realism.
Finally, we introduce a low-level image encoder to improve image fidelity and
perform instruction tuning on downstream tasks. Furthermore, we build a
comprehensive data pipeline integrating real, synthetic, and open-source
datasets, covering diverse multimodal reference-to-image scenarios, including
image generation, instruction-driven editing, customized generation, and
multi-subject composition. Experiments show that our approach matches strong
unified baselines and even outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods
in several cases.

*Jessica Bader,Mateusz Pach,Maria A. Bravo,Serge Belongie,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stitch是一种无需训练的方法，通过自动生成的边界框将外部位置控制集成到多模态扩散变换器中，解决了文本到图像生成中空间关系准确性的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成模型在准确捕捉空间关系方面存在困难，而随着模型架构的演进，早期改进空间关系的方法与现代模型不兼容。

Method: 通过自动生成边界框，在指定边界框内生成单个对象，然后无缝地将它们拼接在一起。利用特定的注意力头在生成过程中隔离和裁剪单个对象，无需完全完成图像。

Result: 在PosEval基准测试中，Stitch显著提升了基础模型的性能，将FLUX在GenEval位置任务上的表现提高了218%，在PosEval上提高了206%。使用Qwen-Image在PosEval上实现了最先进的结果，比之前模型提高了54%。

Conclusion: Stitch成功地将位置控制集成到领先模型中，无需训练即可实现空间准确且视觉吸引人的图像生成，在基于位置的文本到图像生成方面取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models have advanced rapidly in recent years,
but accurately capturing spatial relationships like "above" or "to the right
of" poses a persistent challenge. Earlier methods improved spatial relationship
following with external position control. However, as architectures evolved to
enhance image quality, these techniques became incompatible with modern models.
We propose Stitch, a training-free method for incorporating external position
control into Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) via
automatically-generated bounding boxes. Stitch produces images that are both
spatially accurate and visually appealing by generating individual objects
within designated bounding boxes and seamlessly stitching them together. We
find that targeted attention heads capture the information necessary to isolate
and cut out individual objects mid-generation, without needing to fully
complete the image. We evaluate Stitch on PosEval, our benchmark for
position-based T2I generation. Featuring five new tasks that extend the concept
of Position beyond the basic GenEval task, PosEval demonstrates that even top
models still have significant room for improvement in position-based
generation. Tested on Qwen-Image, FLUX, and SD3.5, Stitch consistently enhances
base models, even improving FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and by 206%
on PosEval. Stitch achieves state-of-the-art results with Qwen-Image on
PosEval, improving over previous models by 54%, all accomplished while
integrating position control into leading models training-free. Code is

TL;DR: TTT3R通过测试时训练视角改进3D重建模型，利用记忆状态与观测的对齐置信度推导闭式学习率，显著提升长度泛化能力，在全局姿态估计上比基线提升2倍，仅需6GB显存即可处理数千张图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代循环神经网络在3D重建中因线性时间复杂度而具有竞争力，但在超出训练上下文长度时性能显著下降，表现出有限的长度泛化能力。

Method: 从测试时训练视角重新审视3D重建基础模型，将其设计视为在线学习问题，利用记忆状态与观测的对齐置信度推导闭式学习率来平衡历史信息保留与新观测适应。

Result: TTT3R显著改善了长度泛化，在全局姿态估计上比基线提升2倍，以20FPS运行，仅需6GB GPU显存即可处理数千张图像。

Conclusion: 基于测试时训练视角的方法能够有效提升3D重建模型的长度泛化能力，无需额外训练即可实现显著性能改进。

Abstract: Modern Recurrent Neural Networks have become a competitive architecture for
3D reconstruction due to their linear-time complexity. However, their
performance degrades significantly when applied beyond the training context
length, revealing limited length generalization. In this work, we revisit the
3D reconstruction foundation models from a Test-Time Training perspective,
framing their designs as an online learning problem. Building on this
perspective, we leverage the alignment confidence between the memory state and
incoming observations to derive a closed-form learning rate for memory updates,
to balance between retaining historical information and adapting to new
observations. This training-free intervention, termed TTT3R, substantially
improves length generalization, achieving a $2\times$ improvement in global
pose estimation over baselines, while operating at 20 FPS with just 6 GB of GPU
memory to process thousands of images. Code available in

### [134] [Cyclic Ablation: Testing Concept Localization against Functional Regeneration in AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25220)
*Eduard Kapelko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过循环消融方法测试大语言模型中欺骗行为是否可局部移除，发现欺骗行为具有高度韧性，每次消融后都能通过对抗训练恢复，但会导致语言性能逐渐下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型中不良行为（如欺骗）是否可局部移除，还是与核心认知能力深度交织，这对模型安全性和可控性至关重要。

Method: 采用循环消融方法，结合稀疏自编码器、定向消融和对抗训练，在DistilGPT-2模型上尝试消除欺骗概念。

Result: 欺骗行为具有高度韧性，模型通过对抗训练持续恢复欺骗行为（功能再生），但每次消融都导致语言性能逐渐衰退（困惑度上升）。

Conclusion: 复杂概念是分布式且相互纠缠的，通过机制可解释性进行直接模型编辑存在局限性。

Abstract: Safety and controllability are critical for large language models. A central
question is whether undesirable behaviors like deception are localized
functions that can be removed, or if they are deeply intertwined with a model's
core cognitive abilities. We introduce "cyclic ablation," an iterative method
to test this. By combining sparse autoencoders, targeted ablation, and
adversarial training on DistilGPT-2, we attempted to eliminate the concept of
deception. We found that, contrary to the localization hypothesis, deception
was highly resilient. The model consistently recovered its deceptive behavior
after each ablation cycle via adversarial training, a process we term
functional regeneration. Crucially, every attempt at this "neurosurgery" caused
a gradual but measurable decay in general linguistic performance, reflected by
a consistent rise in perplexity. These findings are consistent with the view
that complex concepts are distributed and entangled, underscoring the
limitations of direct model editing through mechanistic interpretability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文通过证明语言模型内部表征的几何特性可作为评估生成文本质量的可靠代理，连接了内部和外部分析方法。研究发现内在维度和有效秩可作为文本自然度和质量的通用评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连接语言模型的内部和外部分析方法，寻找不需要人工标注数据就能评估文本质量的方法，为自动化评估流程提供实用优势。

Method: 验证一组度量指标，包括最大可解释方差、有效秩、内在维度、MAUVE分数和Schatten范数，在语言模型不同层进行测量。

Result: 发现不同模型基于这些几何特性对各种来源的文本进行一致排序，表明这些指标反映的是文本固有特性而非模型特定伪影。内在维度和有效秩可作为文本自然度和质量的通用评估。

Conclusion: 基于内部表征几何特性的指标可实现无需参考的文本质量评估，为自动化评估流程提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: This paper bridges internal and external analysis approaches to large
language models (LLMs) by demonstrating that geometric properties of internal
model representations serve as reliable proxies for evaluating generated text
quality. We validate a set of metrics including Maximum Explainable Variance,
Effective Rank, Intrinsic Dimensionality, MAUVE score, and Schatten Norms
measured across different layers of LLMs, demonstrating that Intrinsic
Dimensionality and Effective Rank can serve as universal assessments of text
naturalness and quality. Our key finding reveals that different models
consistently rank text from various sources in the same order based on these
geometric properties, indicating that these metrics reflect inherent text
characteristics rather than model-specific artifacts. This allows a
reference-free text quality evaluation that does not require human-annotated
datasets, offering practical advantages for automated evaluation pipelines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConflictScope是一个自动评估LLM在价值冲突中如何优先排序不同价值的框架，通过生成价值冲突场景来测试模型的价值排序能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐数据集缺乏价值冲突场景，而实际部署中LLM经常需要在不同价值间做出权衡，因此需要评估模型的价值优先排序能力。

Method: 构建自动管道，从用户定义的价值集合中采样两个冲突价值生成场景，使用LLM编写的用户提示测试目标模型，通过自由文本响应评估价值排序。

Result: 在开放式评估中，模型从保护性价值转向个人价值；在系统提示中加入详细价值排序可将对齐目标排序的效果提升14%。

Conclusion: 评估模型价值优先排序很重要，系统提示能在价值冲突中适度改善LLM行为对齐，为未来研究提供基础。

Abstract: Past work seeks to align large language model (LLM)-based assistants with a
target set of values, but such assistants are frequently forced to make
tradeoffs between values when deployed. In response to the scarcity of value
conflict in existing alignment datasets, we introduce ConflictScope, an
automatic pipeline to evaluate how LLMs prioritize different values. Given a
user-defined value set, ConflictScope automatically generates scenarios in
which a language model faces a conflict between two values sampled from the
set. It then prompts target models with an LLM-written "user prompt" and
evaluates their free-text responses to elicit a ranking over values in the
value set. Comparing results between multiple-choice and open-ended
evaluations, we find that models shift away from supporting protective values,
such as harmlessness, and toward supporting personal values, such as user
autonomy, in more open-ended value conflict settings. However, including
detailed value orderings in models' system prompts improves alignment with a
target ranking by 14%, showing that system prompting can achieve moderate
success at aligning LLM behavior under value conflict. Our work demonstrates
the importance of evaluating value prioritization in models and provides a
foundation for future work in this area.

*Qiyao Ma,Yunsheng Shi,Hongtao Tian,Chao Wang,Weiming Chang,Ting Yao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了思考监督奖励模型(TRM)，通过句子级思考监督赋予奖励模型批判性思维能力，解决开放域问答中RLVR难以验证正确性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放域问答等复杂任务中，RLVR面临验证困难的挑战，现有方法过度关注与支持文档的语义对齐，导致模型过度依赖外部知识而缺乏批判性评估能力。

Method: TRM首先评估每个答案句子与支持文档的忠实度，然后通过推理步骤评估句子级正确性，将奖励建模结构化为忠实度、推理和正确性评估的序列。

Result: 实验表明TRM显著提高了错误句子的识别能力，将TRM融入策略优化后，答案正确性和实用性均有显著提升。

Conclusion: TRM通过引入批判性思考能力，有效平衡了对外部知识和内部知识的利用，在复杂问答任务中取得了更好的性能。

Abstract: Through reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), large language
models have achieved substantial progress in domains with easily verifiable
outcomes, such as mathematics and coding. However, when applied to more complex
tasks like open-domain question answering, RLVR faces significant challenges
due to the difficulty of verifying correctness. The nuanced and ambiguous
nature of real-world knowledge makes it difficult to reliably evaluate
correctness in these settings, necessitating further abilities that extend
beyond mere logical consistency to encompass an understanding and assessment of
both external and internal knowledge. Recent work has primarily focused on
improving faithfulness, defined as semantic alignment with supporting
documents, which can cause models to rely excessively on external sources and
diminish their capacity for critical assessment. To address this, we propose
the Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM), which incorporates sentence-level
thinking supervision to endow reward models with critical thinking abilities.
Given a query, answer, and supporting documents, TRM first assesses the
faithfulness of each answer sentence to the supporting documents, and then
applies a reasoning step to evaluate sentence-level correctness. By structuring
reward modeling as a sequence of faithfulness, reasoning, and correctness
evaluations, TRM encourages models to critically assess and leverage both
external and internal knowledge. Experiments on reward signals demonstrate that
TRM substantially improves the identification of incorrect sentences, and
incorporating TRM into policy optimization leads to significant gains in both
answer correctness and usefulness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感TTS方法依赖粗粒度标签或代理分类器，只能获得语句级反馈，无法进行细粒度情感控制

Method: 引入EASPM时间条件模型对噪声中间语音状态评分，自动构建偏好对，通过EASPO优化生成以匹配这些逐步偏好

Result: 实验表明在表达性和自然度方面均优于现有方法

Conclusion: EASPO框架通过中间步骤的细粒度情感偏好优化，实现了更优的情感TTS性能

Abstract: Emotional text-to-speech seeks to convey affect while preserving
intelligibility and prosody, yet existing methods rely on coarse labels or
proxy classifiers and receive only utterance-level feedback. We introduce
Emotion-Aware Stepwise Preference Optimization (EASPO), a post-training
framework that aligns diffusion TTS with fine-grained emotional preferences at
intermediate denoising steps. Central to our approach is EASPM, a
time-conditioned model that scores noisy intermediate speech states and enables
automatic preference pair construction. EASPO optimizes generation to match
these stepwise preferences, enabling controllable emotional shaping.
Experiments show superior performance over existing methods in both
expressiveness and naturalness.

Motivation: LLM在长篇科学问答中容易产生幻觉，而科学模拟器作为验证假设的重要工具，可以增强答案的事实性，但现有RAG方法无法直接应用于科学模拟器检索。

Method: 提出SimulRAG框架，包括通用模拟器检索接口（文本与数值模态转换）和基于不确定性估计与模拟器边界评估的声明级生成方法。

Result: 在气候科学和流行病学基准测试中，SimulRAG在信息量上优于传统RAG 30.4%，在事实性上优于16.3%。UE+SBA进一步提高了声明级生成的效率和质量。

Conclusion: SimulRAG通过科学模拟器检索有效缓解了LLM在长篇科学问答中的幻觉问题，显著提升了答案的质量和可信度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving scientific problems.
They can help generate long-form answers for scientific questions, which are
crucial for comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena that require
detailed explanations spanning multiple interconnected concepts and evidence.
However, LLMs often suffer from hallucination, especially in the challenging
task of long-form scientific question answering. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) approaches can ground LLMs by incorporating external knowledge sources to
improve trustworthiness. In this context, scientific simulators, which play a
vital role in validating hypotheses, offer a particularly promising retrieval
source to mitigate hallucination and enhance answer factuality. However,
existing RAG approaches cannot be directly applied for scientific
simulation-based retrieval due to two fundamental challenges: how to retrieve
from scientific simulators, and how to efficiently verify and update long-form
answers. To overcome these challenges, we propose the simulator-based RAG
framework (SimulRAG) and provide a long-form scientific QA benchmark covering
climate science and epidemiology with ground truth verified by both simulations
and human annotators. In this framework, we propose a generalized simulator
retrieval interface to transform between textual and numerical modalities. We
further design a claim-level generation method that utilizes uncertainty
estimation scores and simulator boundary assessment (UE+SBA) to efficiently
verify and update claims. Extensive experiments demonstrate SimulRAG
outperforms traditional RAG baselines by 30.4% in informativeness and 16.3% in
factuality. UE+SBA further improves efficiency and quality for claim-level
generation.

TL;DR: 评估ChatGPT、Gemini和NotebookLM在新闻报道任务中的幻觉问题，发现30%输出包含幻觉，Gemini和ChatGPT的幻觉率是NotebookLM的3倍，主要错误类型是解释性过度自信而非虚构实体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在新闻编辑室工作流程中应用日益增多，但其幻觉倾向对新闻业的核心实践（来源、归属和准确性）构成风险，需要评估这些工具在真实报道任务中的表现。

Method: 基于300份关于TikTok诉讼和政策的文档语料库，评估三种工具在报道式任务中的表现，通过变化提示特异性和上下文大小，使用分类法对句子级输出进行注释以测量幻觉类型和严重程度。

Result: 30%的模型输出包含至少一个幻觉，Gemini和ChatGPT的幻觉率（40%）约为NotebookLM（13%）的3倍；主要错误不是虚构实体或数字，而是解释性过度自信——模型添加了未经支持的来源特征描述，并将归因观点转化为一般性陈述。

Conclusion: LLM与新闻业存在根本的认识论不匹配：新闻业要求每个主张都有明确来源，而LLM无论证据支持如何都会生成权威性文本；需要开发能够强制准确归属而非优化流畅性的新闻专用工具架构。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in newsroom workflows, but
their tendency to hallucinate poses risks to core journalistic practices of
sourcing, attribution, and accuracy. We evaluate three widely used tools -
ChatGPT, Gemini, and NotebookLM - on a reporting-style task grounded in a
300-document corpus related to TikTok litigation and policy in the U.S. We vary
prompt specificity and context size and annotate sentence-level outputs using a
taxonomy to measure hallucination type and severity. Across our sample, 30% of
model outputs contained at least one hallucination, with rates approximately
three times higher for Gemini and ChatGPT (40%) than for NotebookLM (13%).
Qualitatively, most errors did not involve invented entities or numbers;
instead, we observed interpretive overconfidence - models added unsupported
characterizations of sources and transformed attributed opinions into general
statements. These patterns reveal a fundamental epistemological mismatch: While
journalism requires explicit sourcing for every claim, LLMs generate
authoritative-sounding text regardless of evidentiary support. We propose
journalism-specific extensions to existing hallucination taxonomies and argue
that effective newsroom tools need architectures that enforce accurate
attribution rather than optimize for fluency.

TL;DR: 对Whisper多语言ASR模型的解码器进行细粒度分析，发现高资源语言在正确token排名、置信度、预测熵和候选多样性方面表现更好，而低资源语言在这些指标上表现较差，且在子token使用上呈现不同的聚类模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索端到端多语言ASR模型内部机制，特别是在不同语言间的公平性和有效性方面，这些机制目前研究不足。

Method: 通过追踪beam搜索路径，捕获子token假设及其相关概率，使用PCA和t-SNE分析子token使用模式。

Result: 高资源语言正确token排名更高、置信度更高、预测熵更低、候选多样性更大；低资源语言在这些指标上表现较差，但子token使用呈现受类型学影响的聚类模式。

Conclusion: 子token探测揭示了被聚合错误率掩盖的系统性解码差异，为改善语音技术不平衡发展提供了针对性干预方向。

Abstract: While large multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) models achieve
remarkable performance, the internal mechanisms of the end-to-end pipeline,
particularly concerning fairness and efficacy across languages, remain
underexplored. This paper introduces a fine-grained analysis of Whisper's
multilingual decoder, examining its sub-token hypotheses during transcription
across languages with various resource levels. Our method traces the beam
search path, capturing sub-token guesses and their associated probabilities.
Results reveal that higher resource languages benefit from higher likelihood of
the correct token being top-ranked, greater confidence, lower predictive
entropy, and more diverse alternative candidates. Lower resource languages fare
worse on these metrics, but also exhibit distinct clustering patterns in
sub-token usage sometimes influenced by typology in our PCA and t-SNE analysis.
This sub-token probing uncovers systematic decoding disparities masked by
aggregate error rates and points towards targeted interventions to ameliorate
the imbalanced development of speech technology.

TL;DR: MixtureVitae是一个旨在最小化法律风险同时提供强大模型性能的开源预训练语料库，通过结合公共领域、宽松许可文本和经过论证的低风险数据源构建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统网络爬取数据存在的法律风险问题，提供一个既合法合规又具有竞争力的预训练数据集，减少对无差别网络抓取的依赖。

Method: 采用风险缓解的数据获取策略，结合公共领域和宽松许可文本，配合精心论证的低风险数据源，以及有针对性的指令、推理和合成数据。构建了透明的多阶段流水线进行许可证感知过滤、安全质量筛选和领域感知混合。

Result: 在130M/400M/1.3B/1.7B参数的固定架构下，使用50B和300B token训练预算的实验中，MixtureVitae训练的模型在标准基准测试中持续优于其他宽松许可数据集，在1.7B/300B设置下超越了FineWeb-Edu并接近DCLM。在数学/代码任务上表现尤为突出，在问答任务上具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 研究表明，以宽松许可为主、风险缓解的数据为训练能力强的LLM提供了实用且法律上缓解的基础，在不牺牲竞争力的前提下减少了对无差别网络抓取的依赖。

Abstract: We present MixtureVitae, an open-access pretraining corpus built to minimize
legal risk while providing strong model performance. MixtureVitae follows a
risk-mitigated sourcing strategy that combines public-domain and permissively
licensed text (e.g., CC-BY/Apache) with carefully justified low-risk additions
(e.g., government works and EU TDM-eligible sources), alongside targeted
instruction, reasoning and synthetic data with documented provenance. We detail
a transparent, multi-stage pipeline for license-aware filtering, safety and
quality screening, and domain-aware mixing, and we release the dataset and
curation recipes to support reproducible research. In controlled experiments
using the open-sci-ref training protocol (fixed architectures at
130M/400M/1.3B/1.7B parameters; training budgets of 50B and 300B tokens),
models trained on MixtureVitae consistently outperform other permissive
datasets across a suite of standard benchmarks, and at the 1.7B/300B setting
they surpass FineWeb-Edu and approach DCLM in the later stages of training.
Performance is particularly strong on math/code and competitive on QA tasks.
These results demonstrate that permissive-first, risk-mitigated data provides a
practical and legally mitigated foundation for training capable LLMs, reducing
reliance on indiscriminate web scraping without sacrificing competitiveness.

### [144] [Calibrating Verbalized Confidence with Self-Generated Distractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25532)
*Victor Wang,Elias Stengel-Eskin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出DINCO方法，通过评估LLM的暗示性偏差来校准置信度估计，结合生成器-验证器不一致性和跨不兼容声明的连贯性来改善置信度校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的置信度估计存在错误校准问题，模型在低准确率实例上表现出过度自信，这损害了用户信任和安全性。作者假设这种过度自信源于LLM在面对其编码信息较少的声明时的高度暗示性。

Method: 提出Distractor-Normalized Coherence (DINCO)方法：1) 让模型在多个自生成的干扰项上独立表达置信度；2) 通过总置信度进行归一化；3) 利用生成器-验证器不一致性，用基于一致性的生成器置信度估计来增强归一化验证器置信度。

Result: DINCO提供更少饱和且更可用的置信度估计，在10次推理调用下优于100次调用的自一致性方法，进一步采样无法缩小DINCO与基线之间的差距。

Conclusion: DINCO通过评估暗示性偏差和整合互补的连贯性维度，显著改善了LLM置信度校准，为构建可信赖的AI系统提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Calibrated confidence estimates are necessary for large language model (LLM)
outputs to be trusted by human users. While LLMs can express their confidence
in human-interpretable ways, verbalized LLM-generated confidence scores have
empirically been found to be miscalibrated, reporting high confidence on
instances with low accuracy and thereby harming trust and safety. We
hypothesize that this overconfidence often stems from a given LLM's heightened
suggestibility when faced with claims that it encodes little information about;
we empirically validate this hypothesis, finding more suggestibility on
lower-accuracy claims. Building on this finding, we introduce
Distractor-Normalized Coherence (DINCO), which estimates and accounts for an
LLM's suggestibility bias by having the model verbalize its confidence
independently across several self-generated distractors (i.e. alternative
claims), and normalizes by the total verbalized confidence. To further improve
calibration, we leverage generator-validator disagreement, augmenting
normalized validator confidence with a consistency-based estimate of generator
confidence. Here, we frame the popular approach of self-consistency as
leveraging coherence across sampled generations, and normalized verbalized
confidence as leveraging coherence across validations on incompatible claims,
allowing us to integrate these complementary dimensions of coherence into
DINCO. Moreover, our analysis shows that DINCO provides less saturated -- and
therefore more usable -- confidence estimates, and that further sampling alone
cannot close the gap between DINCO and baselines, with DINCO at 10 inference
calls outperforming self-consistency at 100.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级的自我奖励框架，通过模型自身作为评分者生成基于评分标准的奖励信号，显著提升推理性能，同时使模型成为更强的评分者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到在HealthBench研究中，使用模型自身作为评分者并生成基于评分标准的奖励信号能大幅改善推理性能，且训练后的模型也成为更强的评分者。

Method: 引入了自我奖励基于评分标准的强化学习框架，这是一种轻量级方法，支持更快、更资源高效的训练。

Result: 在Qwen3-32B上，仅使用4000样本的HealthBench Easy子集训练，就能获得超越GPT-5在HealthBench Hard上的表现。加入少量教师评分数据可进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 该框架在开放端推理任务中表现出色，实现了高效的训练和优越的性能。

Abstract: Open-ended evaluation is essential for deploying large language models in
real-world settings. In studying HealthBench, we observe that using the model
itself as a grader and generating rubric-based reward signals substantially
improves reasoning performance. Remarkably, the trained model also becomes a
stronger grader. Motivated by this, we introduce Self-Rewarding Rubric-Based
Reinforcement Learning for Open-Ended Reasoning, a lightweight framework that
enables faster and more resource-efficient training while surpassing baselines.
Remarkably, on Qwen3-32B, training with just the 4000-sample HealthBench Easy
subset is sufficient to obtain a model that exceeds GPT-5 on HealthBench Hard.
Incorporating a small amount of teacher-graded data further enhances
performance for less capable models.

TL;DR: 提出PB-RLSVR框架，通过基于语义验证奖励的强化学习，利用高性能英语LLM作为支点模型，将推理能力跨语言迁移到多语言模型，显著缩小英语与其他语言之间的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习在提升LLM推理能力时主要局限于英语，导致不同语言间存在显著性能差距的问题。

Method: 使用高性能英语LLM作为支点模型生成参考响应，通过基于嵌入和机器翻译的跨语言语义奖励函数，奖励多语言模型与英语参考响应的语义等价性。

Result: 在Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct和Qwen3-32B上分别提升多语言平均性能16.41%和10.17%，显著优于传统PPO基线。

Conclusion: PB-RLSVR提供了一种强大且数据高效的方法来构建真正的多语言推理代理，无需目标语言的人工标注数据。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the reasoning abilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs), these gains are largely confined to English, creating a
significant performance disparity across languages. To address this, we
introduce Pivot-Based Reinforcement Learning with Semantically Verifiable
Rewards (PB-RLSVR), a novel framework that enhances multilingual reasoning by
circumventing the need for human-annotated data in target languages. Our
approach employs a high-performing English LLM as a "pivot" model to generate
reference responses for reasoning tasks. A multilingual model is then rewarded
based on the semantic equivalence of its responses to the English reference,
effectively transferring the pivot model's reasoning capabilities across
languages. We investigate several cross-lingual semantic reward functions,
including those based on embeddings and machine translation. Extensive
experiments on a suite of multilingual reasoning benchmarks show that our
method significantly narrows the performance gap between English and other
languages, substantially outperforming traditional PPO baselines. Specifically,
our PB-RLSVR framework improves the average multilingual performance of
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-32B by 16.41% and 10.17%, respectively,
demonstrating a powerful and data-efficient approach to building truly
multilingual reasoning agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究儿童在4岁前经常省略主语的现象，验证Orfitelli和Hyams关于英语儿童因表现影响混淆祈使句和陈述句从而形成暂时性空主语语法的假设。

Method: 提出新的计算参数来测量这种误读，并将其整合到强制性主语语法学习的模拟模型中，使用改进的变分学习器处理超集-子集语言。

Result: 模拟结果支持Orfitelli和Hyams的假设，证实儿童确实会因混淆祈使句和陈述句而暂时采用空主语语法。

Conclusion: 本研究为将计算模型整合到语法习得研究中提供了框架，同时考虑了其他关键发展因素。

Abstract: The empirically established null subject (NS) stage, lasting until about 4
years of age, involves frequent omission of subjects by children. Orfitelli and
Hyams (2012) observe that young English speakers often confuse imperative NS
utterances with declarative ones due to performance influences, promoting a
temporary null subject grammar. We propose a new computational parameter to
measure this misinterpretation and incorporate it into a simulated model of
obligatory subject grammar learning. Using a modified version of the
Variational Learner (Yang, 2012) which works for superset-subset languages, our
simulations support Orfitelli and Hyams' hypothesis. More generally, this study
outlines a framework for integrating computational models in the study of
grammatical acquisition alongside other key developmental factors.

TL;DR: 提出了PDP（Pairwise Difference Pearson）这一新的机器翻译元评估指标，通过使用成对差异而非原始分数来解决传统Pearson和Kendall方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统Pearson相关系数和Kendall tau系数在机器翻译元评估中的局限性，提供更稳健的评估方法。

Method: PDP是一种基于相关性的指标，利用所有段落的成对差异信息，通过段内成对差异比较来改进全局Pearson方法。

Result: 在WMT'24共享任务中，PDP能正确排序评估指标，与人类错误权重更一致，且对随机噪声、段落偏差和系统偏差具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PDP是一个有效的机器翻译元评估指标，对噪声具有鲁棒性，但对极端异常值敏感。

Abstract: This paper introduces Pairwise Difference Pearson (PDP), a novel
segment-level meta-evaluation metric for Machine Translation (MT) that address
limitations in previous Pearson's $\rho$-based and and Kendall's $\tau$-based
meta-evaluation approaches. PDP is a correlation-based metric that utilizes
pairwise differences rather than raw scores. It draws on information from all
segments for a more robust understanding of score distributions and uses
segment-wise pairwise differences to refine Global Pearson to intra-segment
score comparisons. Analysis on the WMT'24 shared task shows PDP properly ranks
sentinel evaluation metrics and better aligns with human error weightings than
previous work. Noise injection analysis demonstrates PDP's robustness to random
noise, segment bias, and system bias while highlighting its sensitivity to
extreme outliers.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究小规模视觉语言模型在幽默和浪漫风格上的数据效率对齐，探索用最少偏好数据实现风格饱和的性能极限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于transformer的视觉语言模型在零样本设置下难以生成特定风格（如幽默、浪漫）的图像描述，而获取偏好数据成本高昂，限制了模型能力的充分探索。

Method: 研究小规模视觉语言模型的数据效率对齐，通过分析需要多少偏好数据才能达到风格饱和，来评估模型的能力和局限性。

Result: 该研究定义了模型在幽默和浪漫风格上的性能极限，并确定了实现风格饱和所需的最小偏好数据量。

Conclusion: 通过数据效率对齐方法，可以更有效地探索小规模视觉语言模型在特定风格生成上的能力，为模型性能评估提供基准。

Abstract: Vision-language models are increasingly used to generate image captions in
specific styles, such as humor or romantic. However, these transformer-based
models often struggle with this subjective task in a zero-shot setting. While
preference data can be used to align them toward a desired style, such data is
expensive to acquire, limiting the ability to explore the models' full
capabilities. This work addresses this by studying the data efficiency of
aligning small vision-language models to humor and romantic styles. This
approach helps to define the performance limits of these models and determine
how little preference data is needed to achieve stylistic saturation,
benchmarking their capabilities and limitations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了RFG方法，无需显式过程奖励即可指导扩散大语言模型的推理轨迹，通过参数化过程奖励为增强模型和参考模型的似然比来实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型在解决复杂问题时需要逐步指导推理过程，但传统方法需要密集标注中间步骤的过程奖励，这在扩散模型中难以实现，因为生成是任意顺序的且中间状态是部分掩码的句子。

Method: RFG方法将过程奖励参数化为增强模型和参考扩散大语言模型的似然比，增强模型可以通过任何现成的经过强化学习或监督微调后训练的扩散模型获得。

Result: 在四个具有挑战性的数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，RFG在所有任务和模型类型上均取得显著改进，准确率提升高达9.2%。

Conclusion: RFG是一个通用的无需训练框架，可以在不依赖外部奖励模型的情况下扩展测试时推理能力。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have shown great potential in
large-scale language modeling, and there is an increasing interest in further
improving the capacity to solve complex problems by guiding the reasoning
process step by step. Common practice for autoregressive language models
typically learns a process reward model with dense annotation for each
intermediate step. However, this is challenging for dLLMs where the generation
is in an any-order fashion and intermediate states are partially masked
sentences. To this end, in this paper, we propose reward-free guidance (RFG), a
principled method for guiding the reasoning trajectory of dLLMs without
explicit process reward. The key idea of RFG is to parameterize the process
reward by log-likelihood ratios of the enhanced and reference dLLMs, where the
enhanced model can be easily obtained by any off-the-shelf dLLM that has been
post-trained with reinforcement learning (RL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
We provide theoretical justification that RFG induces the reward-guided
sampling distribution with no additional reward. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on four challenging mathematical reasoning and code generation
benchmarks using a diverse suite of dLLMs enhanced with various post-training
methods. RFG consistently yields significant improvements across all tasks and
model types, achieving accuracy gains of up to 9.2%. These findings establish
RFG as a general training-free framework that scales test-time reasoning
without reliance on external reward models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了Transformer架构作为概率测度间映射的性质，完整刻画了能够通过推前映射表示为上下文映射的测度间映射的特征，并证明了Transformer可以普遍逼近具有任何连续上下文映射的表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了数学化、统一地分析Transformer架构的表达能力，研究其处理任意大量上下文token的能力，将神经网络建模为概率测度上的映射，这在研究Wasserstein正则性、证明泛化界限和分析相互作用粒子动力学等方面有广泛应用。

Method: 将Transformer建模为概率测度间的映射，研究这些映射的性质，包括保持支撑基数性和其Fréchet导数的正则部分一致连续性。通过推前映射来表征上下文映射，并分析无限深度、平均场测度理论Transformer与Vlasov流的等价关系。

Result: 完整刻画了能够表示为上下文映射的测度间映射的特征，证明了Transformer可以普遍逼近具有任何连续上下文映射的表示。同时证明了Vlasov方程的解映射满足这些条件，因此可以被Transformer逼近，而测度理论自注意力具有确保无限深度平均场测度理论Transformer可识别为Vlasov流的性质。

Conclusion: Transformer架构作为概率测度间映射具有特定的数学性质，能够普遍逼近连续上下文映射，并且与Vlasov方程描述的相互作用粒子系统的平均场动力学存在深刻的数学联系。

Abstract: Transformers are deep architectures that define ``in-context maps'' which
enable predicting new tokens based on a given set of tokens (such as a prompt
in NLP applications or a set of patches for a vision transformer). In previous
work, we studied the ability of these architectures to handle an arbitrarily
large number of context tokens. To mathematically, uniformly analyze their
expressivity, we considered the case that the mappings are conditioned on a
context represented by a probability distribution which becomes discrete for a
finite number of tokens. Modeling neural networks as maps on probability
measures has multiple applications, such as studying Wasserstein regularity,
proving generalization bounds and doing a mean-field limit analysis of the
dynamics of interacting particles as they go through the network. In this work,
we study the question what kind of maps between measures are transformers. We
fully characterize the properties of maps between measures that enable these to
be represented in terms of in-context maps via a push forward. On the one hand,
these include transformers; on the other hand, transformers universally
approximate representations with any continuous in-context map. These
properties are preserving the cardinality of support and that the regular part
of their Fr\'{e}chet derivative is uniformly continuous. Moreover, we show that
the solution map of the Vlasov equation, which is of nonlocal transport type,
for interacting particle systems in the mean-field regime for the Cauchy
problem satisfies the conditions on the one hand and, hence, can be
approximated by a transformer; on the other hand, we prove that the
measure-theoretic self-attention has the properties that ensure that the
infinite depth, mean-field measure-theoretic transformer can be identified with
a Vlasov flow.

TL;DR: 提出了一个大规模、实时的数据集和计算框架，用于系统性研究新闻媒体中的选择偏见和框架偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流新闻机构不仅通过发布的文章直接影响公众认知，还通过选择报道哪些话题以及如何框架这些议题来塑造舆论。然而，大规模测量这些微妙形式的媒体偏见仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 开发了一个集成大型语言模型（LLMs）与可扩展、近实时新闻抓取的数据管道，提取结构化注释（包括政治倾向、语气、主题、文章类型和主要事件），每天处理数百篇文章。

Result: 在多个层面（句子级、文章级、出版商级）量化了报道的维度，扩展了研究人员分析现代新闻环境中媒体偏见的方式。发布了交互式网络平台便于数据探索。

Conclusion: 建立了一个可重复的大规模研究媒体偏见的方法论，为未来研究提供实证资源，并展示了数据集如何揭示新闻报道和偏见中的有洞察力模式，支持学术研究和提高媒体问责制的实际努力。

Abstract: Mainstream news organizations shape public perception not only directly
through the articles they publish but also through the choices they make about
which topics to cover (or ignore) and how to frame the issues they do decide to
cover. However, measuring these subtle forms of media bias at scale remains a
challenge. Here, we introduce a large, ongoing (from January 1, 2024 to
present), near real-time dataset and computational framework developed to
enable systematic study of selection and framing bias in news coverage. Our
pipeline integrates large language models (LLMs) with scalable, near-real-time
news scraping to extract structured annotations -- including political lean,
tone, topics, article type, and major events -- across hundreds of articles per
day. We quantify these dimensions of coverage at multiple levels -- the
sentence level, the article level, and the publisher level -- expanding the
ways in which researchers can analyze media bias in the modern news landscape.
In addition to a curated dataset, we also release an interactive web platform
for convenient exploration of these data. Together, these contributions
establish a reusable methodology for studying media bias at scale, providing
empirical resources for future research. Leveraging the breadth of the corpus
over time and across publishers, we also present some examples (focused on the
150,000+ articles examined in 2024) that illustrate how this novel data set can
reveal insightful patterns in news coverage and bias, supporting academic
research and real-world efforts to improve media accountability.

TL;DR: QFrBLiMP是一个用于评估LLM在魁北克法语语法现象上语言知识的基准语料库，包含1,761个最小对，涵盖20种语言现象，通过人工标注比较LLM与人类的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 创建专门针对魁北克法语的评估基准，测试LLM在特定语法现象上的语言能力，并与人类表现进行对比。

Method: 从魁北克政府官方资源手动提取并修改句子创建最小对，由12名魁北克法语母语者标注语法正确性，通过比较LLM对最小对中句子概率分配来评估能力。

Result: 模型能力随规模增加而提升，但出现了明显的难度层次。所有模型在需要深度语义理解的现象上表现一致不佳，与人类表现存在显著差距。

Conclusion: LLM在魁北克法语语法理解上存在局限性，特别是在语义理解方面与人类能力有显著差距，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Quebec-French Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal
Pairs (QFrBLiMP), a corpus designed to evaluate the linguistic knowledge of
LLMs on prominent grammatical phenomena in Quebec-French. QFrBLiMP consists of
1,761 minimal pairs annotated with 20 linguistic phenomena. Specifically, these
minimal pairs have been created by manually modifying sentences extracted from
an official online resource maintained by a Qu\'ebec government institution.
Each pair is annotated by twelve Quebec-French native speakers, who select the
sentence they feel is grammatical amongst the two. These annotations are used
to compare the competency of LLMs with that of humans. We evaluate different
LLMs on QFrBLiMP and MultiBLiMP-Fr by observing the rate of higher
probabilities assigned to the sentences of each minimal pair for each category.
We find that while grammatical competence scales with model size, a clear
hierarchy of difficulty emerges. All benchmarked models consistently fail on
phenomena requiring deep semantic understanding, revealing a critical
limitation and a significant gap compared to human performance on these
specific tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基准测试的可靠性对模型评估和进展至关重要，当前基准可能存在性能分布不均导致误导性结论的问题。

Method: 从分布视角研究基准可靠性，引入基准和谐度指标，在19个多选基准和5个模型家族上计算和谐度的均值-方差平面。

Result: 分析显示不和谐的基准会产生误导结果，如ARC-Easy中生物概念问题主导了整体准确率，掩盖了其他重要子领域。

Conclusion: 建议在报告准确率的同时报告和谐度，将评估从简单性能平均转向更稳健、分布可靠的性能测量。

Abstract: Benchmarks shape scientific conclusions about model capabilities and steer
model development. This creates a feedback loop: stronger benchmarks drive
better models, and better models demand more discriminative benchmarks.
Ensuring benchmark reliability is therefore essential for trustworthy
evaluation and meaningful progress. In this work, we study benchmark
reliability from a distributional perspective and introduce benchmark harmony,
which measures how uniformly a model's performance is distributed across the
subdomains of a benchmark. We posit that high harmony is a desirable benchmark
property, indicating that the aggregate metric reflects uniform competence
across subdomains. Across 19 multiple-choice benchmarks and five model
families, we map each benchmark onto a mean-variance plane of harmony computed
across models, where high mean and low variance signal more reliable
evaluation. Our analysis shows that less harmonious benchmarks can give
misleading results, since overall accuracy may be disproportionately influenced
by specific subdomains. For instance, ARC-Easy is overwhelmed by questions on
Biological Concepts, overshadowing other critical subdomains such as Geography,
Physics, Chemistry, and Environmental Science. By recommending that harmony
should be reported alongside accuracy, we reframe evaluation from simple
performance averages to a more robust, distributionally reliable measurement of
performance.

TL;DR: BiasUnlearn是一个新的语言模型去偏框架，通过双路径遗忘机制协调刻板印象遗忘与反刻板印象保留，同时通过对抗性遗忘集和动态数据集交换防止偏见极性反转，在保持语言建模能力的同时有效减轻偏见。


<details>

Motivation: 现有参数修改去偏方法显著降低文本连贯性和任务准确性等核心能力，而基于提示的去偏方法仅对预定义触发词有效，无法解决模型参数中深度嵌入的刻板印象关联。

Method: 提出BiasUnlearn框架，采用双路径遗忘机制协调刻板印象遗忘与反刻板印象保留，使用对抗性遗忘集和动态数据集交换防止偏见极性反转。

Result: 在多个语言模型和各种评估基准上的广泛实验表明，BiasUnlearn在减轻语言模型偏见方面优于现有方法，同时保持语言建模能力。去偏权重可在模型变体间迁移，证实偏见表示在预训练期间固化并在微调阶段持续存在。

Conclusion: BiasUnlearn通过协调遗忘机制有效减轻语言模型偏见，同时保持核心能力，且去偏权重具有可迁移性，表明偏见在预训练中固化并在后续阶段持续存在。

Abstract: Many studies have shown various biases targeting different demographic groups
in language models, amplifying discrimination and harming fairness. Recent
parameter modification debiasing approaches significantly degrade core
capabilities such as text coherence and task accuracy. And Prompt-based
debiasing methods, only effective for predefined trigger words, fail to address
deeply embedded stereotypical associations in model parameters. In this paper,
we propose BiasUnlearn, a novel model debiasing framework which achieves
targeted debiasing via dual-pathway unlearning mechanisms coordinating
stereotype forgetting with anti-stereotype retention, while preventing bias
polarity reversal through adversarial forget set and dynamic dataset swapping.
We conducted extensive experiments with multiple language models across various
evaluation benchmarks. The results show that BiasUnlearn outperforms existing
methods in mitigating bias in language models while retaining language modeling
capabilities. Further experiments reveal that debiasing weights are
transferable across model variants, confirming that bias representations become
entrenched during pre-training and persist through fine-tuning phases.

(PEFT) with mixture-of-experts (MoE) is an effective strategy for adapting
large language models (LLMs) to the downstream tasks. However, most existing
approaches rely on conventional TopK routing, which requires careful
hyperparameter tuning and assigns a fixed number of experts to each token. In
this work, we propose LD-MoLE, a Learnable Dynamic routing mechanism for
Mixture of LoRA Experts that enables adaptive, token-dependent, and layer-wise
expert allocation. Our method replaces the non-differentiable TopK selection
with a differentiable routing function and a closed-form solution. Moreover,
our design allows the model to adaptively determine the number of experts to
activate for each token at different layers. In addition, we introduce an
analytical sparsity control objective to regularize the number of activated
experts. Extensive experiments on the Qwen3-1.7B and Llama-3.2-3B models show
that LD-MoLE achieves the highest average scores compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, across a diverse set of benchmarks. Our method not only achieves
superior performance, but also demonstrates the ability to learn
token-dependent and layer-wise expert allocation.

TL;DR: 提出评估数学原子能力的新范式，将数学能力分解为跨学科领域和逻辑推理两个维度的基本单元，通过实验探索不同原子能力间的相互影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型主要依赖扩大训练数据集，但无法确定模型是否真正掌握数学概念和推理原理，还是仅仅记忆训练数据。受人类将复杂问题分解为基本能力的启发，需要新的评估范式。

Method: 将原子能力分为两个维度：(1)跨学科领域能力：代数、几何、分析和拓扑；(2)逻辑能力：概念理解、前向多步推理、反例驱动的后向推理。为每个原子能力单元构建相应的训练和评估数据集。

Result: 在先进模型上的评估和实验结果显示，不同原子能力表现存在显著差异，原子能力间存在有趣的相互影响关系。

Conclusion: 将数学智能解耦为原子组件具有重要意义，为模型认知提供新见解，并指导开发更高效、可迁移和认知基础的"原子思维"训练策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in
mathematical reasoning capabilities. However, we argue that current large-scale
reasoning models primarily rely on scaling up training datasets with diverse
mathematical problems and long thinking chains, which raises questions about
whether LLMs genuinely acquire mathematical concepts and reasoning principles
or merely remember the training data. In contrast, humans tend to break down
complex problems into multiple fundamental atomic capabilities. Inspired by
this, we propose a new paradigm for evaluating mathematical atomic
capabilities. Our work categorizes atomic abilities into two dimensions: (1)
field-specific abilities across four major mathematical fields, algebra,
geometry, analysis, and topology, and (2) logical abilities at different
levels, including conceptual understanding, forward multi-step reasoning with
formal math language, and counterexample-driven backward reasoning. We propose
corresponding training and evaluation datasets for each atomic capability unit,
and conduct extensive experiments about how different atomic capabilities
influence others, to explore the strategies to elicit the required specific
atomic capability. Evaluation and experimental results on advanced models show
many interesting discoveries and inspirations about the different performances
of models on various atomic capabilities and the interactions between atomic
capabilities. Our findings highlight the importance of decoupling mathematical
intelligence into atomic components, providing new insights into model
cognition and guiding the development of training strategies toward a more
efficient, transferable, and cognitively grounded paradigm of "atomic
thinking".

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于去识别化和HIPS理论的隐私保护合成文本生成方法，通过实体感知控制码引导可控生成，在保持隐私保护的同时确保文本实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗、社会服务和法律等高风险领域，文本匿名化对于负责任地开发和部署AI至关重要，需要平衡隐私保护与文本实用性。

Method: 使用实体感知控制码引导可控生成，包含两种变体：基于上下文学习的ICL变体和基于前缀调优的变体，后者采用自定义掩码策略和损失函数支持可扩展的高质量生成。

Result: 在法律和临床数据集上的实验表明，该方法在隐私保护和实用性之间实现了良好平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法为敏感领域的合成文本生成提供了实用有效的解决方案，能够在保护隐私的同时保持文本质量。

Abstract: Text anonymization is essential for responsibly developing and deploying AI
in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, social services, and law. In this
work, we propose a novel methodology for privacy-preserving synthetic text
generation that leverages the principles of de-identification and the Hiding In
Plain Sight (HIPS) theory. Our approach introduces entity-aware control codes
to guide controllable generation using either in-context learning (ICL) or
prefix tuning. The ICL variant ensures privacy levels consistent with the
underlying de-identification system, while the prefix tuning variant
incorporates a custom masking strategy and loss function to support scalable,
high-quality generation. Experiments on legal and clinical datasets demonstrate
that our method achieves a strong balance between privacy protection and
utility, offering a practical and effective solution for synthetic text
generation in sensitive domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI心理咨询研究采用一次性生成方法合成多轮对话样本，导致治疗保真度低且无法捕捉每个回应的决策逻辑。

Method: CATCH框架包含渐进式对话合成策略（从用户自述提取目标、资源和解决方案，组织成结构化大纲，逐步生成阶段对齐的咨询对话）和记忆驱动动态规划思维模式（整合记忆增强、全局规划和策略推理），通过多智能体优化器为每个对话轮次附加显式思维链。

Result: 大量实验和人工评估表明，CATCH显著提升了AI心理咨询的保真度和逻辑连贯性。

Conclusion: CATCH框架有效解决了AI心理咨询中的关键挑战，为高质量心理咨询对话生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recently, advancements in AI counseling based on large language models have
shown significant progress. However, existing studies employ a one-time
generation approach to synthesize multi-turn dialogue samples, resulting in low
therapy fidelity and failing to capture the decision-making rationale behind
each response. In this work, we propose CATCH, a novel data synthesis framework
designed to address these challenges. Specifically, to improve therapy
fidelity, we introduce the Progressive Dialogue Synthesis strategy, which
extracts goals, resources, and solutions from a client's self-report, organizes
them into structured outlines, and then incrementally generates stage-aligned
counseling dialogues. To capture decision-making rationale behind each
response, we propose the Memory-Driven Dynamic Planning thinking pattern that
integrates memory enhancement, global planning, and strategy reasoning; a
collaborative multi-agent optimizer then leverages MDP to attach explicit
chain-of-thought to each dialogue turn. Extensive experiments and human
evaluations demonstrate that CATCH significantly enhances fidelity and logical
coherence in AI counseling.

Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) depends heavily on large-scale,
high-quality instruction-following and reinforcement datasets. However,
generating such data through human annotation is prohibitively time-consuming
particularly for domain-specific tasks like telecom network troubleshooting,
where accurate responses require deep technical expertise and contextual
understanding. In this paper, we present a fully automated, retrieval-augmented
pipeline for generating synthetic question-answer (QA) pairs grounded in
structured domain knowledge. Our multi-stage framework integrates a retriever,
base generator, and refinement model to synthesize and enhance QA pairs using
documents retrieved from a domain-specific knowledge graph. To ensure data
quality, we employ customized RAGAS-based scoring to filter low-quality
samples, producing a high-quality dataset suitable for reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). We demonstrate our approach in a real-world telecom scenario
focused on radio access network (RAN) troubleshooting. The resulting pipeline
generates complex, context-rich troubleshooting solution plans without human
intervention. This work offers a scalable solution for building instruction and
reinforcement datasets in specialized domains, significantly reducing
dependence on manual labeling while maintaining high technical fidelity.

Abstract: The detection of hopeful speech in social media has emerged as a critical
task for promoting positive discourse and well-being. In this paper, we present
a machine learning approach to multiclass hope speech detection across multiple
languages, including English, Urdu, and Spanish. We leverage transformer-based
models, specifically XLM-RoBERTa, to detect and categorize hope speech into
three distinct classes: Generalized Hope, Realistic Hope, and Unrealistic Hope.
Our proposed methodology is evaluated on the PolyHope dataset for the
PolyHope-M 2025 shared task, achieving competitive performance across all
languages. We compare our results with existing models, demonstrating that our
approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art techniques in terms
of macro F1 scores. We also discuss the challenges in detecting hope speech in
low-resource languages and the potential for improving generalization. This
work contributes to the development of multilingual, fine-grained hope speech
detection models, which can be applied to enhance positive content moderation
and foster supportive online communities.

TL;DR: TruthRL是一个强化学习框架，通过三元奖励机制直接优化大语言模型的真实性，区分正确答案、幻觉和弃权，显著减少幻觉并提高真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在优化准确性时会放大幻觉，而鼓励弃权的方法又过于保守，牺牲正确答案，这两种极端都损害了真实性。

Method: 使用GRPO实现TruthRL，采用三元奖励机制，激励模型不仅提供正确答案，还在不确定时弃权。

Result: 在四个知识密集型基准测试中，TruthRL相比普通RL显著减少幻觉28.9%，提高真实性21.1%，在各种骨干模型下表现一致。

Conclusion: TruthRL在准确性和真实性方面都表现强劲，强调了学习目标设计对于开发真实LLMs的重要性。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on
factoid question answering, they are still prone to hallucination and
untruthful responses, particularly when tasks demand information outside their
parametric knowledge. Indeed, truthfulness requires more than accuracy --
models must also recognize uncertainty and abstain when unsure to avoid
hallucinations. This presents a fundamental challenge for existing methods:
approaches that optimize for accuracy often amplify hallucinations, while those
that encourage abstention can become overly conservative, sacrificing correct
answers. Both extremes ultimately compromise truthfulness. In this work, we
present TruthRL, a general reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly
optimizes the truthfulness of LLMs. Specifically, we implement TruthRL using
GRPO with a simple yet effective ternary reward that distinguishes correct
answers, hallucinations, and abstentions. It incentivizes models to reduce
hallucinations not only by providing correct responses, but also by enabling
abstention when uncertain, thereby improving truthfulness. Extensive
experiments across four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that, compared to
vanilla RL, TruthRL significantly reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves
truthfulness by 21.1%, with consistent gains across various backbone models
(e.g., Qwen, Llama) under both retrieval and non-retrieval setups. In-depth
ablation study demonstrates that vanilla accuracy-driven methods, such as
supervised fine-tuning or RL with a binary reward, struggle to balance factual
correctness and uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed truthfulness-driven
TruthRL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and truthfulness,
underscoring the importance of learning objective design for developing
truthful LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究比较了基于深度神经网络(DNN)嵌入和大型语言模型(LLMs)在抑郁症检测中的算法偏见，重点关注性别和种族/民族差异。LLMs在性能上优于DNN模型，特别是在少数群体中表现更好，但种族偏见仍然存在。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是调查语言模型在抑郁症自动检测中的算法偏见问题，特别关注不同性别和种族/民族群体之间的公平性差异，旨在开发更公平的抑郁症检测方法。

Method: 使用DAIC-WOZ临床访谈数据，比较DNN嵌入模型和LLMs的少样本学习方法。为减轻偏见，在DNN模型中应用公平感知损失函数，在LLMs中探索不同提示框架和样本数量的上下文学习。

Result: LLMs在抑郁症分类上优于DNN模型，特别是对西班牙裔参与者。LLMs的性别偏见小于DNN模型，但种族差异仍然存在。最差组损失在DNN模型中实现性能与公平性的最佳平衡，而公平正则化损失效果较差。在LLMs中，伦理框架的引导提示有助于减轻1-shot设置中的性别偏见。

Conclusion: LLMs在抑郁症检测中表现出更好的性能和较低的性别偏见，但种族偏见问题仍然难以解决。最差组损失是有效的偏见缓解策略，而增加样本数量并不能有效减少种族差异。

Abstract: This paper investigates algorithmic bias in language-based models for
automated depression detection, focusing on socio-demographic disparities
related to gender and race/ethnicity. Models trained using deep neural networks
(DNN) based embeddings are compared to few-shot learning approaches with large
language models (LLMs), evaluating both performance and fairness on clinical
interview transcripts from the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus/Wizard-of-Oz
(DAIC-WOZ). To mitigate bias, fairness-aware loss functions are applied to
DNN-based models, while in-context learning with varied prompt framing and shot
counts is explored for LLMs. Results indicate that LLMs outperform DNN-based
models in depression classification, particularly for underrepresented groups
such as Hispanic participants. LLMs also exhibit reduced gender bias compared
to DNN-based embeddings, though racial disparities persist. Among
fairness-aware techniques for mitigating bias in DNN-based embeddings, the
worst-group loss, which is designed to minimize loss for the worst-performing
demographic group, achieves a better balance between performance and fairness.
In contrast, the fairness-regularized loss minimizes loss across all groups but
performs less effectively. In LLMs, guided prompting with ethical framing helps
mitigate gender bias in the 1-shot setting. However, increasing the number of
shots does not lead to further reductions in disparities. For race/ethnicity,
neither prompting strategy nor increasing $N$ in $N$-shot learning effectively
reduces disparities.

Abstract: Recent advances in question answering have led to substantial progress in

questions by synthesizing information from an entire corpus remains a
significant challenge. A prior graph-based approach to global sensemaking lacks
retrieval mechanisms, topic specificity, and incurs high inference costs. To
address these limitations, we propose ReTAG, a Retrieval-Enhanced,
Topic-Augmented Graph framework that constructs topic-specific subgraphs and
retrieves the relevant summaries for response generation. Experiments show that
ReTAG improves response quality while significantly reducing inference time
compared to the baseline. Our code is available at

Conclusion: DECS证明无需牺牲推理能力即可实现推理效率的大幅提升，解决了过度思考问题，为高效推理模型提供了可行方案。

Abstract: While large reasoning models trained with critic-free reinforcement learning
and verifiable rewards (RLVR) represent the state-of-the-art, their practical
utility is hampered by ``overthinking'', a critical issue where models generate
excessively long reasoning paths without any performance benefit. Existing
solutions that penalize length often fail, inducing performance degradation due
to a fundamental misalignment between trajectory-level rewards and token-level
optimization. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, DECS, built on our
theoretical discovery of two previously unaddressed flaws in current length
rewards: (1) the erroneous penalization of essential exploratory tokens and (2)
the inadvertent rewarding of partial redundancy. Our framework's innovations
include (i) a first-of-its-kind decoupled token-level reward mechanism that
surgically distinguishes and penalizes redundant tokens, and (ii) a novel
curriculum batch scheduling strategy to master the efficiency-efficacy
equilibrium. Experimental results show DECS can achieve a dramatic reduction in
reasoning tokens by over 50\% across seven benchmarks while simultaneously
maintaining or even improving performance. It demonstrates conclusively that
substantial gains in reasoning efficiency can be achieved without compromising
a model's underlying reasoning power.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当用户无法看到视觉上下文时，VLM的自然语言解释可能误导用户相信不准确的预测。需要解决用户对VLM预测的过度依赖问题。

Method: 提出两个解释质量评分函数：视觉保真度（衡量解释对视觉上下文的忠实程度）和对比性（衡量解释区分模型预测与替代方案的能力）。在A-OKVQA和VizWiz任务上进行评估。

Result: 在用户研究中，显示质量评分可将参与者预测VLM正确性的准确率提高11.1%，错误相信不准确预测的比率降低15.4%。

Conclusion: 解释质量评分有助于促进对VLM预测的适当依赖，提高用户判断模型预测可靠性的能力。

Abstract: When people query Vision-Language Models (VLMs) but cannot see the
accompanying visual context (e.g. for blind and low-vision users), augmenting
VLM predictions with natural language explanations can signal which model
predictions are reliable. However, prior work has found that explanations can
easily convince users that inaccurate VLM predictions are correct. To remedy
undesirable overreliance on VLM predictions, we propose evaluating two
complementary qualities of VLM-generated explanations via two quality scoring
functions. We propose Visual Fidelity, which captures how faithful an
explanation is to the visual context, and Contrastiveness, which captures how
well the explanation identifies visual details that distinguish the model's
prediction from plausible alternatives. On the A-OKVQA and VizWiz tasks, these
quality scoring functions are better calibrated with model correctness than
existing explanation qualities. We conduct a user study in which participants
have to decide whether a VLM prediction is accurate without viewing its visual
context. We observe that showing our quality scores alongside VLM explanations
improves participants' accuracy at predicting VLM correctness by 11.1%,
including a 15.4% reduction in the rate of falsely believing incorrect
predictions. These findings highlight the utility of explanation quality scores
in fostering appropriate reliance on VLM predictions.

localization, and (3) correction. We benchmark 9 state-of-the-art LLMs,
revealing limited performance ($\sim$50\% accuracy). Even top models such as
GPT-4o fail to distinguish factual from confabulated scientific answers,

### [171] [RoleConflictBench: A Benchmark of Role Conflict Scenarios for Evaluating LLMs' Contextual Sensitivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25897)
*Jisu Shin,Hoyun Song,Juhyun Oh,Changgeon Ko,Eunsu Kim,Chani Jung,Alice Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了RoleConflictBench基准来评估大语言模型在角色冲突情境中的上下文敏感性，发现LLMs虽然对情境线索有一定反应能力，但决策主要受社会角色固有偏见主导，而非情境信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在人类决策中影响力增强，需要理解它们在复杂社交情境中的行为。角色冲突代表固有的模糊社交困境，需要上下文敏感性来识别和权衡情境线索。

Method: 使用三阶段流水线生成超过13K个现实角色冲突场景，涵盖65个角色，系统性地改变相关期望和情境紧急程度，分析10个不同LLMs的模型选择。

Result: LLMs对上下文线索的敏感性不足，决策主要由强大的固有社会角色偏见主导，表现出对家庭和职业领域角色的偏好，以及优先考虑男性角色和亚伯拉罕宗教的明显倾向。

Conclusion: LLMs在角色冲突情境中的上下文敏感性有限，其决策受到社会角色偏见的显著影响，这凸显了在复杂社交困境中评估和改进模型行为的重要性。

Abstract: Humans often encounter role conflicts -- social dilemmas where the
expectations of multiple roles clash and cannot be simultaneously fulfilled. As
large language models (LLMs) become increasingly influential in human
decision-making, understanding how they behave in complex social situations is
essential. While previous research has evaluated LLMs' social abilities in
contexts with predefined correct answers, role conflicts represent inherently
ambiguous social dilemmas that require contextual sensitivity: the ability to
recognize and appropriately weigh situational cues that can fundamentally alter
decision priorities. To address this gap, we introduce RoleConflictBench, a
novel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' contextual sensitivity in complex
social dilemmas. Our benchmark employs a three-stage pipeline to generate over
13K realistic role conflict scenarios across 65 roles, systematically varying
their associated expectations (i.e., their responsibilities and obligations)
and situational urgency levels. By analyzing model choices across 10 different
LLMs, we find that while LLMs show some capacity to respond to these contextual
cues, this sensitivity is insufficient. Instead, their decisions are
predominantly governed by a powerful, inherent bias related to social roles
rather than situational information. Our analysis quantifies these biases,
revealing a dominant preference for roles within the Family and Occupation
domains, as well as a clear prioritization of male roles and Abrahamic
religions across most evaluatee models.

*Dominik Macko,Andrew Pulver*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出PerQ方法，用于高效评估文本个性化质量，减少对大语言模型元评估的依赖和成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏评估文本特定方面（如个性化质量）的指标，研究者通常依赖大语言模型进行元评估，但多个模型的使用会增加成本且存在内部偏见

Method: 引入PerQ方法，这是一种计算效率高的文本个性化质量评估方法

Result: 通过大模型与小模型生成能力的案例研究，证明了PerQ指标在研究中具有实用性

Conclusion: PerQ方法能有效减少资源浪费，为文本个性化质量评估提供高效解决方案

Abstract: Since no metrics are available to evaluate specific aspects of a text, such
as its personalization quality, the researchers often rely solely on large
language models to meta-evaluate such texts. Due to internal biases of
individual language models, it is recommended to use multiple of them for
combined evaluation, which directly increases costs of such meta-evaluation. In
this paper, a computationally efficient method for evaluation of
personalization quality of a given text (generated by a language model) is
introduced, called PerQ. A case study of comparison of generation capabilities
of large and small language models shows the usability of the proposed metric
in research, effectively reducing the waste of resources.

TL;DR: Mem-alpha是一个强化学习框架，通过训练LLM代理有效管理复杂记忆系统，解决了现有记忆增强代理在信息存储、结构化和更新方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于记忆增强的LLM代理依赖预定义指令和工具进行记忆更新，但语言模型缺乏确定存储哪些信息、如何结构化以及何时更新的能力，导致记忆构建不理想和信息丢失。

Method: 提出Mem-alpha强化学习框架，构建专门训练数据集涵盖多样多轮交互模式，代理处理序列信息块，学习提取和存储相关内容并更新记忆系统，奖励信号来自下游问答准确性。

Result: Mem-alpha在现有记忆增强代理基准上取得显著改进，尽管仅在最长30k token的实例上训练，但能泛化到超过400k token的序列，是训练长度的13倍以上。

Conclusion: Mem-alpha框架通过强化学习训练代理有效管理复杂记忆系统，展示了在长序列处理上的强大泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are constrained by limited context windows,
necessitating external memory systems for long-term information understanding.
Current memory-augmented agents typically depend on pre-defined instructions
and tools for memory updates. However, language models may lack the ability to
determine which information to store, how to structure it, and when to update
it, especially as memory systems become more complex. This results in
suboptimal memory construction and information loss. To this end, we propose
Mem-alpha, a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to effectively
manage complex memory systems through interaction and feedback. We also
construct a specialized training dataset spanning diverse multi-turn
interaction patterns paired with comprehensive evaluation questions designed to
teach effective memory management. During training, agents process sequential
information chunks, learn to extract and store relevant content, then update
the memory system. The reward signal derives from downstream question-answering
accuracy over the full interaction history, directly optimizing for memory
construction. To illustrate the effectiveness of our training framework, we
design a memory architecture comprising core, episodic, and semantic
components, equipped with multiple tools for memory operations. Empirical
evaluation demonstrates that Mem-alpha achieves significant improvements over
existing memory-augmented agent baselines. Despite being trained exclusively on
instances with a maximum length of 30k tokens, our agents exhibit remarkable
generalization to sequences exceeding 400k tokens, over 13x the training
length, highlighting the robustness of Mem-alpha.

TL;DR: 本文提出了KERN路由器作为Softmax路由器的替代方案，通过将MoE重新解释为Nadaraya-Watson回归，开发了一种零额外成本的FFN风格路由器函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型一直使用Softmax作为路由器函数，但这种选择缺乏理论依据。作者发现MoE与Nadaraya-Watson回归具有相同的数学形式，这为重新设计路由器提供了理论基础。

Method: 基于Nadaraya-Watson回归的洞察，提出了KERN路由器函数，它推广了Sigmoid和Softmax路由器，推荐使用ReLU激活和ℓ2归一化。

Result: 在MoE和LLM上的综合实验验证了所提出的FFN风格路由器函数的有效性。

Conclusion: KERN路由器为MoE提供了一种理论上有依据且有效的Softmax替代方案，无需额外计算成本。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a cornerstone in recent state-of-the-art
large language models (LLMs). Traditionally, MoE relies on $\mathrm{Softmax}$
as the router score function to aggregate expert output, a designed choice that
has persisted from the earliest MoE models to modern LLMs, and is now widely
regarded as standard practice. However, the necessity of using
$\mathrm{Softmax}$ to project router weights into a probability simplex remains
an unchallenged assumption rather than a principled design choice. In this
work, we first revisit the classical Nadaraya-Watson regression and observe
that MoE shares the same mathematical formulation as Nadaraya-Watson
regression. Furthermore, we show that both feed-forward neural network (FFN)
and MoE can be interpreted as a special case of Nadaraya-Watson regression,
where the kernel function corresponds to the input neurons of the output layer.
Motivated by these insights, we propose the \textbf{zero-additional-cost}
Kernel Inspired Router with Normalization (KERN), an FFN-style router function,
as an alternative to $\mathrm{Softmax}$. We demonstrate that this router
generalizes both $\mathrm{Sigmoid}$- and $\mathrm{Softmax}$-based routers.
\textbf{Based on empirical observations and established practices in FFN
implementation, we recommend the use of $\mathrm{ReLU}$ activation and
$\ell_2$-normalization in $\mathrm{KERN}$ router function.} Comprehensive
experiments in MoE and LLM validate the effectiveness of the proposed FFN-style
router function \methodNorm.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了多种替代架构（xLSTMs、结构化状态空间模型、扩散模型和对抗学习）在序列标注任务中的表现，发现它们在简单设置中表现良好，但在跨语言和复杂结构化任务中泛化能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Transformer编码器在序列标注中占主导地位，但其他架构在语言建模中显示出潜力，需要研究这些架构在不同复杂度的标注任务中的适应性。

Method: 研究多种替代架构（xLSTMs、结构化状态空间模型、扩散模型、对抗学习）在不同结构复杂度、标签空间和token依赖关系的标注任务中的表现，并进行跨语言评估。

Result: 这些架构在简单设置中表现良好，但在跨语言和复杂结构化任务中泛化能力不佳，无法很好地扩展到更复杂的结构化任务。

Conclusion: 替代架构在序列标注任务中的表现存在局限性，特别是在处理跨语言和复杂结构化任务时，其泛化能力不如预期。

Abstract: Pretrained Transformer encoders are the dominant approach to sequence
labeling. While some alternative architectures-such as xLSTMs, structured
state-space models, diffusion models, and adversarial learning-have shown
promise in language modeling, few have been applied to sequence labeling, and
mostly on flat or simplified tasks. We study how these architectures adapt
across tagging tasks that vary in structural complexity, label space, and token
dependencies, with evaluation spanning multiple languages. We find that the
strong performance previously observed in simpler settings does not always
generalize well across languages or datasets, nor does it extend to more
complex structured tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前无参考语法纠错评估指标虽然与人工评价相关性高，但无法有效防御旨在获取不正当高分的对抗系统，这会误导用户选择不合适的GEC系统。

Method: 针对SOME、Scribendi、IMPARA和基于LLM的四种无参考指标，提出了对抗攻击策略，开发了能够获得不合理高分的对抗系统。

Result: 开发的对抗系统在四种无参考指标上均超越了当前最先进水平，成功获得了不正当的高分。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明现有无参考评估方法存在严重漏洞，亟需开发更鲁棒的评估方法来确保自动评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Reference-free evaluation metrics for grammatical error correction (GEC) have
achieved high correlation with human judgments. However, these metrics are not
designed to evaluate adversarial systems that aim to obtain unjustifiably high
scores. The existence of such systems undermines the reliability of automatic
evaluation, as it can mislead users in selecting appropriate GEC systems. In
this study, we propose adversarial attack strategies for four reference-free
metrics: SOME, Scribendi, IMPARA, and LLM-based metrics, and demonstrate that
our adversarial systems outperform the current state-of-the-art. These findings
highlight the need for more robust evaluation methods.

TL;DR: RAGferee方法将问答数据集转化为偏好对，训练专门用于评估RAG响应的上下文奖励模型，在ContextualJudgeBench上超越现有大型模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型基于通用偏好数据训练，难以评估RAG场景中响应与检索上下文的忠实度、相关性、拒绝能力、完整性和简洁性

Method: 提出RAGferee方法，将问答数据集重新构建为优先考虑真实性的偏好对，训练参数从7B到24B的上下文奖励模型

Result: 仅用4K样本训练的RAG专用奖励模型在ContextualJudgeBench上达到最先进性能，比训练在240万样本上的70B+模型绝对提升15.5%

Conclusion: RAGferee方法能够有效训练专门针对RAG场景的奖励模型，小数据集即可超越大型通用模型，解决了RAG评估的专业化需求

Abstract: Existing Reward Models (RMs), typically trained on general preference data,
struggle in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) settings, which require
judging responses for faithfulness to retrieved context, relevance to the user
query, appropriate refusals when context is insufficient, completeness and
conciseness of information. To address the lack of publicly available
RAG-centric preference datasets and specialised RMs, we introduce RAGferee, a
methodology that repurposes question-answering (QA) datasets into preference
pairs that prioritise groundedness over stylistic features, enabling the
training of contextual RMs better suited to judging RAG responses. Using
RAGferee, we curate a small preference dataset of 4K samples and fine-tune RMs
ranging from 7B to 24B parameters. Our RAG-centric RMs achieve state-of-the-art
performance on ContextualJudgeBench, surpassing existing 70B+ RMs trained on
much larger (up to 2.4M samples) general corpora, with an absolute improvement
of +15.5%.

TL;DR: 提出RE²方法，通过语法错误解释而非文本相似度来检索参考示例，提升中文语法错误纠正性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖文本相似度检索示例，但这种方法经常与实际的错误模式不匹配，检索到词汇相似但语法无关的句子

Method: 提出RE²方法，使用语法错误解释来选择参考示例，而不是输入句子的文本相似度，并创建了高质量的语法错误解释数据集

Result: 在两个CGEC数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法有效提升了中文语法错误纠正的性能

Conclusion: 基于语法错误解释的示例检索方法比传统的文本相似度方法更有效，能够显著提升大语言模型在中文语法错误纠正任务上的表现

Abstract: The primary objective of Chinese grammatical error correction (CGEC) is to
detect and correct errors in Chinese sentences. Recent research shows that
large language models (LLMs) have been applied to CGEC with significant
results. For LLMs, selecting appropriate reference examples can help improve
their performance. However, existing methods predominantly rely on text
similarity for example retrieval, a strategy that frequently mismatches actual
error patterns and retrieves lexically similar yet grammatically irrelevant
sentences. To address this problem, we propose a method named RE$^2$, which
retrieves appropriate examples with explanations of grammatical errors. Instead
of using text similarity of the input sentence, we use explanations of
grammatical errors to select reference examples, which are used by LLMs to
improve the performance of CGEC. We conduct experiments on two CGEC datasets
and create a high-quality grammatical error explanation (GEE) dataset, which is
not only used in our research but also serves as a valuable resource for future
studies in both CGEC and GEE. The experimental results on the two datasets
indicate that our proposed method effectively improves the performance of CGEC.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究系统评估了大型语言模型在思维链提示下的忠实性，发现模型推理过程受到提示中嵌入的答案捷径的显著影响，正确提示能提高准确性但错误提示会降低性能，且模型对提示的承认程度因提示类型而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型生成的思维链推理在多大程度上忠实于实际计算过程，而非受提示中嵌入的答案捷径影响而形成的后验叙述。

Method: 在四个数据集(AIME、GSM-Hard、MATH-500、UniADILR)和两个先进模型(GPT-4o、Gemini-2-Flash)上，通过控制提示条件(正确性、呈现风格、复杂度)进行系统性实验，评估任务准确性和提示承认情况。

Result: 1)正确提示显著提高准确性，错误提示在基线能力较低的任务中大幅降低准确性；2)方程提示常被引用，原始提示常被静默采用；3)奉承式提示鼓励公开承认，泄露式提示提高准确性但促进隐藏依赖。

Conclusion: LLM推理过程系统性受到提示中捷径的影响，这掩盖了推理的忠实性，反映了RLHF相关效应的影响。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT)
prompting to solve mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. Yet, a central
question remains: to what extent are these generated rationales \emph{faithful}
to the underlying computations, rather than post-hoc narratives shaped by hints
that function as answer shortcuts embedded in the prompt? Following prior work
on hinted vs.\ unhinted prompting, we present a systematic study of CoT
faithfulness under controlled hint manipulations. Our experimental design spans
four datasets (AIME, GSM-Hard, MATH-500, UniADILR), two state-of-the-art models
(GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash), and a structured set of hint conditions varying in
correctness (correct and incorrect), presentation style (sycophancy and data
leak), and complexity (raw answers, two-operator expressions, four-operator
expressions). We evaluate both task accuracy and whether hints are explicitly
acknowledged in the reasoning. Our results reveal three key findings. First,
correct hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks
and logical reasoning, while incorrect hints sharply reduce accuracy in tasks
with lower baseline competence. Second, acknowledgement of hints is highly
uneven: equation-based hints are frequently referenced, whereas raw hints are
often adopted silently, indicating that more complex hints push models toward
verbalizing their reliance in the reasoning process. Third, presentation style
matters: sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement, while leak-style
prompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance. This may reflect
RLHF-related effects, as sycophancy exploits the human-pleasing side and data
leak triggers the self-censoring side. Together, these results demonstrate that
LLM reasoning is systematically shaped by shortcuts in ways that obscure
faithfulness.

TL;DR: 提出RE-Searcher方法，通过目标导向规划和自我反思来增强LLM搜索代理在复杂搜索环境中的鲁棒性，解决查询变化导致的脆弱搜索行为问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在知识密集型问答中表现优异，但受限于知识截止、幻觉和交互模式限制。虽然外部搜索工具能缓解这些问题，但复杂搜索环境中查询的微小变化会导致推理偏离正轨并放大错误。

Method: 提出RE-Searcher方法：在搜索过程中明确阐述具体搜索目标，然后反思检索到的证据是否满足该目标。结合目标导向规划和自我反思来抵抗复杂环境中的虚假线索。

Result: 实验表明该方法提高了搜索准确性并达到最先进结果。扰动研究进一步证明对噪声或误导性外部信号具有显著韧性，减轻了搜索过程的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为将LLM驱动的代理集成到更复杂的交互环境中并实现更自主的决策提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at knowledge-intensive question answering
and reasoning, yet their real-world deployment remains constrained by knowledge
cutoff, hallucination, and limited interaction modalities. Augmenting LLMs with
external search tools helps alleviate these issues, but it also exposes agents
to a complex search environment in which small, plausible variations in query
formulation can steer reasoning into unproductive trajectories and amplify
errors. We present a systematic analysis that quantifies how environmental
complexity induces fragile search behaviors and, in turn, degrades overall
performance. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective
approach to instantiate a search agent, RE-Searcher. During search, RE-Searcher
explicitly articulates a concrete search goal and subsequently reflects on
whether the retrieved evidence satisfies that goal. This combination of
goal-oriented planning and self-reflection enables RE-Searcher to resist
spurious cues in complex search environments and perform robust search.
Extensive experiments show that our method improves search accuracy and
achieves state-of-the-art results. Perturbation studies further demonstrate
substantial resilience to noisy or misleading external signals, mitigating the
fragility of the search process. We believe these findings offer practical
guidance for integrating LLM-powered agents into more complex interactive
environments and enabling more autonomous decision-making.

Motivation: 现有机器生成文本检测研究主要集中于英语，对非英语语言特别是中欧语言的检测能力较差，且跨语言迁移性研究不足。

Method: 建立了首个中欧语言机器生成文本检测基准，通过多领域、多生成器和多语言评估，比较不同训练语言组合的性能表现。

Result: 监督微调的检测器在中欧语言中表现最佳，同时对这些语言的混淆攻击最具抵抗力。

Conclusion: 需要针对特定语言开发专门的检测方法，监督微调是提高中欧语言检测性能的有效策略。

Abstract: Machine-generated text detection, as an important task, is predominantly
focused on English in research. This makes the existing detectors almost
unusable for non-English languages, relying purely on cross-lingual
transferability. There exist only a few works focused on any of Central
European languages, leaving the transferability towards these languages rather
unexplored. We fill this gap by providing the first benchmark of detection
methods focused on this region, while also providing comparison of
train-languages combinations to identify the best performing ones. We focus on
multi-domain, multi-generator, and multilingual evaluation, pinpointing the
differences of individual aspects, as well as adversarial robustness of
detection methods. Supervised finetuned detectors in the Central European
languages are found the most performant in these languages as well as the most
resistant against obfuscation.

TL;DR: DyFlow是一个动态工作流生成框架，通过自适应构建和调整推理过程来增强跨任务泛化能力，显著优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的智能体系统大多依赖手动设计的工作流程，限制了跨任务的适应性。虽然少数方法尝试自动生成工作流，但通常与特定数据集或查询类型绑定，且对中间反馈利用有限，导致系统鲁棒性和推理深度不足。

Method: DyFlow包含两个核心组件：设计器和执行器。设计器将复杂问题分解为一系列由高层目标定义的子目标，并根据中间输出和反馈动态规划下一步。执行器使用具有上下文感知参数化的动态操作符来执行每个操作，实现灵活且语义基础的推理。

Result: 在社交推理、生物医学任务、数学问题解决和代码生成等多个领域的系统评估表明，DyFlow显著优于现有基线方法，实现了显著的Pass@k改进，并在不同领域展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DyFlow通过动态工作流生成和自适应调整，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为构建高效且可泛化的智能体系统提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Agent systems based on large language models (LLMs) have shown great
potential in complex reasoning tasks, but building efficient and generalizable
workflows remains a major challenge. Most existing approaches rely on manually
designed processes, which limits their adaptability across different tasks.
While a few methods attempt automated workflow generation, they are often tied
to specific datasets or query types and make limited use of intermediate
feedback, reducing system robustness and reasoning depth. Moreover, their
operations are typically predefined and inflexible. To address these
limitations, we propose DyFlow, a dynamic workflow generation framework that
adaptively constructs and adjusts reasoning procedures based on task
requirements and real-time intermediate feedback, thereby enhancing cross-task
generalization. DyFlow consists of two core components: a designer and an
executor. The designer decomposes complex problems into a sequence of sub-goals
defined by high-level objectives and dynamically plans the next steps based on
intermediate outputs and feedback. These plans are then carried out by the
executor, which executes each operation using dynamic operators with
context-aware parameterization, enabling flexible and semantically grounded
reasoning. We systematically evaluate DyFlow across diverse domains, including
social reasoning, biomedical tasks, mathematical problem solving, and code
generation. Results demonstrate that DyFlow significantly outperforms existing
baselines, achieving substantial Pass@k improvements and exhibiting robust
generalization across diverse domains. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM作为自动评估器的可靠性问题，发现它们可能依赖提示中的捷径线索而非真实质量进行判断。

Method: 使用ELI5和LitBench数据集构建100对比较任务，让GPT-4o和Gemini-2.5-Flash评估，并注入来源和时间线索。

Result: 两个模型都表现出强烈的新近偏见（偏爱新回答）和明确的来源等级偏见（专家>人类>LLM>未知），且很少承认这些偏见。

Conclusion: 当前LLM评估器容易受捷径影响且不忠实，削弱了其在研究和部署中的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as automatic judges to
evaluate system outputs in tasks such as summarization, dialogue, and creative
writing. A faithful judge should base its verdicts solely on response quality
and explicitly acknowledge the factors shaping its decision. We show that
current LLM judges fail on both counts by relying on shortcuts introduced in
the prompt. Our study uses two evaluation datasets: ELI5, a benchmark for
long-form question answering, and LitBench, a recent benchmark for creative
writing. Both datasets provide pairwise comparisons, where the evaluator must
choose which of two responses is better. From each dataset we construct 100
pairwise judgment tasks and employ two widely used models, GPT-4o and
Gemini-2.5-Flash, as evaluators in the role of LLM-as-a-judge. For each pair,
we assign superficial cues to the responses, provenance cues indicating source
identity (Human, Expert, LLM, or Unknown) and recency cues indicating temporal
origin (Old, 1950 vs. New, 2025), while keeping the rest of the prompt fixed.
Results reveal consistent verdict shifts: both models exhibit a strong recency
bias, systematically favoring new responses over old, as well as a clear
provenance hierarchy (Expert > Human > LLM > Unknown). These biases are
especially pronounced in GPT-4o and in the more subjective and open-ended
LitBench domain. Crucially, cue acknowledgment is rare: justifications almost
never reference the injected cues, instead rationalizing decisions in terms of
content qualities. These findings demonstrate that current LLM-as-a-judge
systems are shortcut-prone and unfaithful, undermining their reliability as
evaluators in both research and deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励建模对于对齐LLM与人类偏好至关重要，但通常受限于偏好数据的高昂成本。现有的文本数据合成方法计算成本高，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用变分自编码器(VAE)学习响应嵌入的结构化潜在表示，在潜在空间进行受控扰动并解码回嵌入空间，生成语义一致的合成偏好对。

Result: 潜在空间合成在标准基准测试中显著优于基于文本的增强方法，生成速度快18倍，使用模型小16,000倍，同时获得更优结果。

Conclusion: LENS为通过高效数据增强改进奖励建模提供了可扩展且有效的替代方案，代码已公开。

Abstract: Reward modeling, crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human
preferences, is often bottlenecked by the high cost of preference data.
Existing textual data synthesis methods are computationally expensive. We
propose a novel framework LENS for synthesizing preference data directly in the
LLM's latent embedding space. Our method employs a Variational Autoencoder
(VAE) to learn a structured latent representation of response embeddings. By
performing controlled perturbations in this latent space and decoding back to
the embedding space, we efficiently generate diverse, semantically consistent
synthetic preference pairs, bypassing costly text generation and annotation. We
provide theoretical guarantees that our synthesized pairs approximately
preserve original preference ordering and improve reward model generalization.
Empirically, our latent-space synthesis significantly outperforms text-based

TL;DR: IMProofBench是一个用于评估大型语言模型在数学研究前沿任务上表现的新基准，包含39个专家设计的同行评审问题，支持详细证明生成和自动化评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学基准仅关注最终答案问题或高中数学竞赛题，无法评估模型在研究前沿的数学推理能力，需要开发更贴近真实研究环境的评估框架。

Method: 构建包含39个同行评审数学问题的私有基准，每个问题需要详细证明并配有子问题；采用代理框架评估，允许模型使用网络搜索和数学软件等工具。

Result: 当前LLM在较易的研究级问题上表现良好，但在挑战性问题上有显著困难。Grok-4在最终答案子问题上准确率52%，GPT-5在证明生成上表现最佳，22%问题完全正确。

Conclusion: IMProofBench作为动态基准将持续发展，确保其评估下一代LLM的相关性，填补了现有数学评估基准在研究前沿任务上的空白。

Abstract: As the mathematical capabilities of large language models (LLMs) improve, it
becomes increasingly important to evaluate their performance on research-level
tasks at the frontier of mathematical knowledge. However, existing benchmarks
are limited, as they focus solely on final-answer questions or high-school
competition problems. To address this gap, we introduce IMProofBench, a private
benchmark consisting of 39 peer-reviewed problems developed by expert
mathematicians. Each problem requires a detailed proof and is paired with
subproblems that have final answers, supporting both an evaluation of
mathematical reasoning capabilities by human experts and a large-scale
quantitative analysis through automated grading. Furthermore, unlike prior
benchmarks, the evaluation setup simulates a realistic research environment:
models operate in an agentic framework with tools like web search for
literature review and mathematical software such as SageMath. Our results show
that current LLMs can succeed at the more accessible research-level questions,
but still encounter significant difficulties on more challenging problems.
Quantitatively, Grok-4 achieves the highest accuracy of 52% on final-answer
subproblems, while GPT-5 obtains the best performance for proof generation,
achieving a fully correct solution for 22% of problems. IMProofBench will
continue to evolve as a dynamic benchmark in collaboration with the
mathematical community, ensuring its relevance for evaluating the next
generation of LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了RSO框架，通过分层策略优化提升对话推荐系统的性能，将响应生成分解为宏观策略规划和微观适应，使用强化学习解决多轮对话数据不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏对交互策略的显式优化，依赖统一提示导致次优结果，需要更有效的策略学习框架。

Method: RSO分层框架：Planner选择策略（推荐、解释、鼓励等），Actor在专家网络指导下生成响应，使用强化学习和LLM奖励进行策略学习。

Result: 实验显示RSO优于现有最先进基线，验证了分层策略优化的有效性。

Conclusion: RSO通过分层策略优化和强化学习有效提升了对话推荐系统的性能，解决了多轮交互策略优化问题。

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) provide personalized
recommendations through multi-turn interactions. With the strong reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), applying them to CRSs has become
promising. Yet, existing methods often lack explicit optimization of
interaction strategies, relying instead on unified prompts, which can yield
suboptimal outcomes. We propose Reinforced Strategy Optimization (RSO), a
hierarchical framework that decomposes response generation into macro-level
strategy planning and micro-level adaptation within a network-of-experts. A
Planner selects strategies (e.g., recommend, explain, encourage), while an
Actor generates responses guided by auxiliary experts for preferences and
factual grounding. This disentanglement enables more tractable learning. To
address limited multi-turn data, we model strategy learning as reinforcement
learning with an LLM-based reward for exploration. Experiments show RSO
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness of
hierarchical strategy optimization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种算法来扩展预训练LLM的词汇表，通过添加领域特定token来解决词汇不匹配问题，从而提高处理速度而不降低分词效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当LLM处理训练领域之外的文本时，词汇不匹配会导致领域特定术语被拆分成多个子词，降低处理速度

Method: 设计算法扩展现有分词器的词汇表，保证分词效率不降低，每个输入序列的分词数量最多与之前相同

Result: 在真实电商用例中，增强后的分词器使输入序列缩短达20%，降低推理延迟，同时保持预测质量

Conclusion: 词汇适应能显著提升LLM在领域外文本处理时的效率，同时保持模型性能

Abstract: When using an LLM to process text outside the training domain(s), an often
overlooked factor is vocabulary mismatch, where the general-domain tokenizer
fails to capture frequent domain-specific terms, leading to higher token
fertility and thus a decrease in processing speed due to suboptimal sub-word
splits.
  We address this limitation by augmenting the pretrained vocabulary with a set
of domain-specific tokens. To this end, we design an algorithm that extends an
existing tokenizer while guaranteeing it never decreases tokenization
efficiency: every input sequence is segmented into at most the same number of
tokens as before.
  Evaluated on real-world e-Commerce use-cases, the augmented tokenizer
significantly shortens input sequences by up to 20% and reduces inference
latency on downstream tasks while preserving predictive quality. We further
analyze secondary effects, such as the impact on forward pass speed and the
rate at which the model adopts the newly introduced tokens, to illustrate the
broader benefits of vocabulary adaptation.

Motivation: 探索LLM多智能体系统中竞争如何影响行为，特别是过度竞争现象及其对协作和任务性能的负面影响。

Method: 提出HATE（饥饿游戏辩论）实验框架，在零和竞争环境中模拟多智能体辩论，测试不同LLM和任务，并引入不同变体的裁判来研究环境反馈的影响。

Result: 竞争压力显著刺激过度竞争行为并降低任务性能，导致讨论偏离轨道；客观的任务导向反馈能有效缓解过度竞争行为。

Conclusion: 揭示了多智能体系统中竞争动态的负面影响，为理解和治理AI社区涌现的社会动态提供了见解，强调了客观反馈在缓解过度竞争中的重要性。

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems demonstrate great potential for tackling
complex problems, but how competition shapes their behavior remains
underexplored. This paper investigates the over-competition in multi-agent
debate, where agents under extreme pressure exhibit unreliable, harmful
behaviors that undermine both collaboration and task performance. To study this
phenomenon, we propose HATE, the Hunger Game Debate, a novel experimental
framework that simulates debates under a zero-sum competition arena. Our
experiments, conducted across a range of LLMs and tasks, reveal that
competitive pressure significantly stimulates over-competition behaviors and
degrades task performance, causing discussions to derail. We further explore
the impact of environmental feedback by adding variants of judges, indicating
that objective, task-focused feedback effectively mitigates the
over-competition behaviors. We also probe the post-hoc kindness of LLMs and
form a leaderboard to characterize top LLMs, providing insights for
understanding and governing the emergent social dynamics of AI community.

Abstract: With their growing capabilities, generative large language models (LLMs) are
being increasingly investigated for complex medical tasks. However, their
effectiveness in real-world clinical applications remains underexplored. To
address this, we present CliniBench, the first benchmark that enables
comparability of well-studied encoder-based classifiers and generative LLMs for
discharge diagnosis prediction from admission notes in MIMIC-IV dataset. Our
extensive study compares 12 generative LLMs and 3 encoder-based classifiers and
demonstrates that encoder-based classifiers consistently outperform generative
models in diagnosis prediction. We assess several retrieval augmentation
strategies for in-context learning from similar patients and find that they
provide notable performance improvements for generative LLMs.

Conclusion: VietBinoculars在越南语LLM生成文本检测方面表现出色，特别是在特殊修改的提示策略下具有显著优势，为多语言文本检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid development research of Large Language Models (LLMs) based on
transformer architectures raises key challenges, one of them being the task of
distinguishing between human-written text and LLM-generated text. As
LLM-generated textual content, becomes increasingly complex over time, and
resembles human writing, traditional detection methods are proving less
effective, especially as the number and diversity of LLMs continue to grow with
new models and versions being released at a rapid pace. This study proposes
VietBinoculars, an adaptation of the Binoculars method with optimized global
thresholds, to enhance the detection of Vietnamese LLM-generated text. We have
constructed new Vietnamese AI-generated datasets to determine the optimal
thresholds for VietBinoculars and to enable benchmarking. The results from our
experiments show results show that VietBinoculars achieves over 99\% in all two
domains of accuracy, F1-score, and AUC on multiple out-of-domain datasets. It
outperforms the original Binoculars model, traditional detection methods, and

Motivation: 现代物流管理系统需要高效的路径规划，OCVRP涉及为服务地理分布客户的车辆车队寻找最优配送路线，且车辆在配送后无需返回仓库。

Method: 使用Python开发两种算法的实现，基于自定义数据集进行性能评估，比较路由效率、计算时间和可扩展性。

Result: ACO在路由参数方面具有灵活性，而OR-Tools运行速度更快、更一致且需要更少的输入。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于为可扩展的实时物流系统选择合适的路由策略。

Abstract: In modern logistics management systems, route planning requires high
efficiency. The Open Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (OCVRP) deals with
finding optimal delivery routes for a fleet of vehicles serving geographically
distributed customers, without requiring the vehicles to return to the depot
after deliveries. The present study is comparative in nature and speaks of two
algorithms for OCVRP solution: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), a nature-inspired
metaheuristic; and Google OR-Tools, an industry-standard toolkit for
optimization. Both implementations were developed in Python and using a custom
dataset. Performance appraisal was based on routing efficiency, computation
time, and scalability. The results show that ACO allows flexibility in routing
parameters while OR-Tools runs much faster with more consistency and requires
less input. This could help choose among routing strategies for scalable
real-time logistics systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实知识图谱中新实体频繁出现，模型需要在不重新训练的情况下泛化到这些实体。但显式类型信息通常缺乏或不完整，即使可用也往往是粗粒度、稀疏且容易出错。

Method: 提出TyleR方法，利用预训练语言模型丰富节点表示的隐式类型信号，用于基于子图的归纳链接预测。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，TyleR在类型注释稀缺和图连接稀疏的场景下优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 预训练语言模型能够有效丰富节点表示的隐式类型信号，在缺乏显式类型信息的情况下提升归纳链接预测性能。

Abstract: Inductive link prediction is emerging as a key paradigm for real-world
knowledge graphs (KGs), where new entities frequently appear and models must
generalize to them without retraining. Predicting links in a KG faces the
challenge of guessing previously unseen entities by leveraging generalizable
node features such as subgraph structure, type annotations, and ontological
constraints. However, explicit type information is often lacking or incomplete.
Even when available, type information in most KGs is often coarse-grained,
sparse, and prone to errors due to human annotation. In this work, we explore
the potential of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to enrich node
representations with implicit type signals. We introduce TyleR, a Type-less yet
type-awaRe approach for subgraph-based inductive link prediction that leverages
PLMs for semantic enrichment. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that TyleR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in scenarios with scarce type
annotations and sparse graph connectivity. To ensure reproducibility, we share

Motivation: 传统微调方法需要复杂的数据混合和重复实验来获得最优泛化性能，这过程繁琐且计算成本高。

Method: 使用零学习率训练在通用数据上获取全局梯度，然后在领域训练中进行梯度增强和动态训练步长校正，结合退火学习建立仅依赖领域数据的微调流程。

Result: 在多个任务和基础模型上，DBA相比传统微调在联合性能上平均提升5.8%，同时减少91.0%的GPU小时数。

Conclusion: DBA提供了一种高效通用的微调解决方案，无需通用数据参与退火过程，消除了数据混合导致的重复实验，显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) fine-tuning shows excellent implications.
However, vanilla fine-tuning methods often require intricate data mixture and
repeated experiments for optimal generalization. To address these challenges
and streamline the training process, we propose an efficient and universal
solution, Dynamic Boosted Annealing (DBA). We obtain a global gradient through
zero-learning-rate training on general data, which is subsequently employed for
gradient boosting and dynamic training step correction during domain training.
In conjunction with annealing learning, we end up establishing a fine-tuning
pipeline that relies solely on domain data without collapse. By evaluating both
general and domain-specific performance across multiple tasks on several
popular base models, DBA achieves an average improvement of 5.8% in joint
performance over vanilla fine-tuning. Furthermore, since general data is no
longer involved in annealing, repeated experiments led by data mixture are also
eliminated. According to our tests, the DBA method can reduce GPU hours by
91.0% compared to the vanilla method.

Method: 使用自监督特征初始化语音标记，应用轻量对齐损失，结合稀疏化和辅助目标训练，构建了0.7B和1.0B纯语音模型以及1.0B文本语音交错模型。

Result: 纯语音模型在说话人、性别、情感、房间和背景因素方面实现了最高的一致性，超越了更大的系统。交错模型改善了词汇句法探测和语义-声学对齐，但降低了一致性。

Conclusion: LM端设计和训练组合能够控制声学稳定性和语义基础之间的平衡，初始化偏向内容结构但牺牲韵律细节，展示了无需架构改变的模型优化方法。

Abstract: We study speech language models that incorporate semantic initialization and
planning losses to achieve robust and consistent generation. Our approach
initializes speech tokens with self-supervised features, applies a light
alignment loss, and trains with thinning and auxiliary objectives that target
robustness and content planning. We train three models: a 0.7B speech-only
model, a 1.0B speech-only model, and a 1.0B interleaved model with both text
and speech. Acoustic studies show that the speech-only models achieve the
highest consistency across speaker, gender, sentiment, room, and background
factors, surpassing larger systems. Interleaving improves lexical and syntactic
probes and semantic--acoustic alignment but reduces consistency. Linear probes
show that our initialization biases the model toward content structure while
trading off prosody detail. These results show that LM-side design and training
mix control the balance between acoustic stability and semantic grounding
without changes to the tokenizer or runtime architecture. A demo and model
weights are available for exploration.

Abstract: Dialogue summarization aims to distill the core meaning of a conversation
into a concise text. This is crucial for reducing the complexity and noise
inherent in dialogue-heavy applications. While recent approaches typically
train language models to mimic human-written summaries, such supervision is
costly and often results in outputs that lack task-specific focus limiting
their effectiveness in downstream applications, such as medical tasks. In this
paper, we propose \app, a framework for task-oriented utility-based dialogue
summarization. \app starts by generating multiple summaries and task-oriented
question-answer pairs from a dialogue in a zero-shot manner using a pool of
large language models (LLMs). The quality of the generated summaries is
evaluated by having LLMs answer task-related questions before \textit{(i)}
selecting the best candidate answers and \textit{(ii)} identifying the most
informative summary based on these answers. Finally, we fine-tune the best LLM
on the selected summaries. When validated on multiple datasets, \app
demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving competitive results in various
zero-shot settings, rivaling fully-supervised State-of-the-Art (SotA) methods.

Conclusion: Feedback Forensics提供了显式评估AI人格的工具，有助于理解和追踪模型在反馈训练中的人格变化，解决了现有不透明评估方法的局限性。

Abstract: Some traits making a "good" AI model are hard to describe upfront. For
example, should responses be more polite or more casual? Such traits are
sometimes summarized as model character or personality. Without a clear
objective, conventional benchmarks based on automatic validation struggle to
measure such traits. Evaluation methods using human feedback such as Chatbot
Arena have emerged as a popular alternative. These methods infer "better"
personality and other desirable traits implicitly by ranking multiple model
responses relative to each other. Recent issues with model releases highlight
limitations of these existing opaque evaluation approaches: a major model was
rolled back over sycophantic personality issues, models were observed
overfitting to such feedback-based leaderboards. Despite these known issues,
limited public tooling exists to explicitly evaluate model personality. We
introduce Feedback Forensics: an open-source toolkit to track AI personality
changes, both those encouraged by human (or AI) feedback, and those exhibited
across AI models trained and evaluated on such feedback. Leveraging AI
annotators, our toolkit enables investigating personality via Python API and
browser app. We demonstrate the toolkit's usefulness in two steps: (A) first we
analyse the personality traits encouraged in popular human feedback datasets
including Chatbot Arena, MultiPref and PRISM; and (B) then use our toolkit to
analyse how much popular models exhibit such traits. We release (1) our

### [200] [One-Token Rollout: Guiding Supervised Fine-Tuning of LLMs with Policy Gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26313)
*Rui Ming,Haoyuan Wu,Shoubo Hu,Zhuolun He,Bei Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OTR是一种新颖的微调算法，通过将自回归学习重构为单步强化学习轨迹，利用策略梯度方法指导监督微调，显著提升语言模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调(SFT)在泛化能力上不如强化学习(RL)，作者认为这种性能差异不仅源于损失函数，更根本的原因是SFT使用固定的预收集数据集，而RL使用从当前策略采样的在线数据。

Method: 提出单步展开(OTR)算法，将每个token生成视为单步强化学习轨迹。在每个步骤中，从当前策略分布中采样多个候选token，使用监督数据中的真实token为这些样本提供奖励信号，通过策略梯度将静态离线数据转化为动态在线信号。

Result: 在数学推理、代码生成和通用领域推理等多个挑战性基准测试中，OTR始终优于标准SFT方法。

Conclusion: OTR为微调大语言模型提供了强大实用的替代方案，证明了数据的在线性质是泛化能力的关键驱动因素，为LLM微调开辟了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the predominant method for adapting large
language models (LLMs), yet it often struggles with generalization compared to
reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we posit that this performance
disparity stems not just from the loss function, but from a more fundamental
difference: SFT learns from a fixed, pre-collected dataset, whereas RL utilizes
on-policy data sampled from the current policy. Building on this hypothesis, we
introduce one-token rollout (OTR), a novel fine-tuning algorithm that guides
SFT with the policy gradient method. OTR reframes the autoregressive learning
process by treating each token generation as a single-step reinforcement
learning trajectory. At each step, it performs a Monte Carlo ``rollout'' by
sampling multiple candidate tokens from the current policy's distribution. The
ground-truth token from the supervised data is then used to provide a reward
signal to these samples. Guided by policy gradient, our algorithm repurposes
static, off-policy supervised data into a dynamic, on-policy signal at the
token level, capturing the generalization benefits of on-policy learning while
bypassing the costly overhead of full sentence generation. Through extensive
experiments on a diverse suite of challenging benchmarks spanning mathematical
reasoning, code generation, and general domain reasoning, we demonstrate that
OTR consistently outperforms standard SFT. Our findings establish OTR as a
powerful and practical alternative for fine-tuning LLMs and provide compelling
evidence that the on-policy nature of data is a critical driver of
generalization, offering a promising new direction for fine-tuning LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了Huggin-3.5B在潜在空间中的思考过程，提出了潜在思考优化(LTO)算法，通过潜在奖励模型(LRM)来改进LLMs的潜在推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLMs的自然语言思维链计算成本高且容易过度思考，而潜在思考架构缺乏可解释性和监督，引发对其正确性和可靠性的担忧。

Method: 提出潜在思考优化(LTO)概率算法，使用潜在分类器作为潜在奖励模型(LRM)来优化潜在思考过程，并展示该方法可泛化到不同领域和通用LLMs。

Result: 实验表明正确与错误答案的潜在思维模式高度可区分，LRM能有效检测错误思维模式，LTO显著改进潜在思考过程，且该方法具有跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 与自然语言思维相比，该方法证明奖励建模和扩展测试时思维监督可直接在潜在空间进行，为改进LLMs思考过程提供了一种通用、高效且领域无关的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at problem solving by generating chain of
thoughts in natural language, but such verbal thinking is computationally
costly and prone to overthinking. Recent work instead proposes a latent
thinking architecture Huggin-3.5B, which represents intermediate reasoning
steps as sequence of latent representations. However, latent thoughts lack
interpretability and are difficult to supervise, raising concerns about the
correctness and reliability of its latent thinking processes. In this paper, we
provide a systematic study of how Huggin-3.5B thinks in the latent space and
how external supervision signals can improve its latent thinking processes. We
show that latent thoughts leading to correct versus incorrect answers exhibit
highly distinguishable patterns, and that a latent classifier can reliably
predict answer correctness directly from latent thoughts. Leveraging these
insights, we propose Latent Thinking Optimization (LTO), a probabilistic
algorithm that employs the latent classifier as a Latent Reward Model (LRM) to
optimize the latent thinking processes. Extensive experiments across diverse
reasoning tasks demonstrate that LRM is highly effective in detecting incorrect
latent thinking patterns, and LTO can significantly improve the latent thinking
processes. Furthermore, we show that LRM can generalize across diverse domains,
and LTO can be seamlessly applied to general LLMs to improve their thinking
processes. In contrast to verbal thinking, our method demonstrates that reward
modeling and scaling test-time thinking with supervision can be performed
directly in the latent space, highlighting its potential as a general,
efficient, and domain-agnostic approach to improving the thinking processes of
LLMs.

TL;DR: Fast-dLLM v2通过块扩散机制将预训练自回归模型转换为并行文本生成的扩散语言模型，仅需1B token微调，实现500倍训练数据减少，同时保持模型性能，解码速度提升2.5倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归大语言模型虽然性能优异，但其顺序解码特性限制了推理效率。需要开发能够保持性能同时实现并行生成的高效方法。

Method: 提出块扩散机制和互补注意力掩码，结合分层缓存机制（块级缓存和子块缓存），以及并行解码流水线，实现高效的并行文本生成。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，Fast-dLLM v2在准确度上匹配或超越自回归基线，同时在dLLMs中实现最先进的效率，解码速度提升2.5倍。

Conclusion: Fast-dLLM v2标志着向快速准确LLMs实际部署迈出的重要一步，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理效率。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance across a wide range of natural language tasks, yet their inherent
sequential decoding limits inference efficiency. In this work, we propose
Fast-dLLM v2, a carefully designed block diffusion language model (dLLM) that
efficiently adapts pretrained AR models into dLLMs for parallel text
generation, requiring only approximately 1B tokens of fine-tuning. This
represents a 500x reduction in training data compared to full-attention
diffusion LLMs such as Dream (580B tokens), while preserving the original
model's performance. Our approach introduces a novel training recipe that
combines a block diffusion mechanism with a complementary attention mask,
enabling blockwise bidirectional context modeling without sacrificing AR
training objectives. To further accelerate decoding, we design a hierarchical
caching mechanism: a block-level cache that stores historical context
representations across blocks, and a sub-block cache that enables efficient
parallel generation within partially decoded blocks. Coupled with our parallel
decoding pipeline, Fast-dLLM v2 achieves up to 2.5x speedup over standard AR
decoding without compromising generation quality. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-dLLM v2 matches or surpasses AR
baselines in accuracy, while delivering state-of-the-art efficiency among dLLMs
- marking a significant step toward the practical deployment of fast and
accurate LLMs. Code and model will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KG-R1是一个通过强化学习优化的知识图谱检索增强生成框架，使用单一智能体与知识图谱交互，实现高效检索和生成，在减少幻觉的同时提高推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的KG-RAG系统通常使用多个LLM模块（规划、推理、响应），导致推理成本高且行为受限于特定知识图谱。需要一种更高效、可迁移的解决方案。

Method: 采用强化学习训练单一智能体，使其能够与知识图谱环境交互，在每一步进行检索并将检索信息整合到推理和生成过程中，实现端到端优化。

Result: 在KGQA基准测试中，使用Qwen-2.5-3B模型的KG-R1比之前的多模块工作流方法使用更少的生成token，同时提高了答案准确性，并且在新知识图谱上无需修改即可保持强准确性。

Conclusion: KG-R1是一个有前景的KG-RAG框架，具有高效性和可迁移性，适合实际部署应用。

Abstract: Knowledge-graph retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) couples large
language models (LLMs) with structured, verifiable knowledge graphs (KGs) to
reduce hallucinations and expose reasoning traces. However, many KG-RAG systems
compose multiple LLM modules (e.g planning, reasoning, and responding),
inflating inference cost and binding behavior to a specific target KG. To
address this, we introduce KG-R1, an agentic KG retrieval-augmented generation
(KG-RAG) framework through reinforcement learning (RL). KG-R1 utilizes a single
agent that interacts with KGs as its environment, learning to retrieve at each
step and incorporating the retrieved information into its reasoning and
generation. The process is optimized through end-to-end RL. In controlled
experiments across Knowledge-Graph Question Answering (KGQA) benchmarks, our
method demonstrates both efficiency and transferability: Using Qwen-2.5-3B,
KG-R1 improves answer accuracy with fewer generation tokens than prior
multi-module workflow methods that use larger foundation or fine-tuned models.
Furthermore, KG-R1 enables plug and play: after training, it maintains strong
accuracy on new KGs without modification. These properties make KG-R1 a
promising KG-RAG framework for real-world deployment. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/Jinyeop3110/KG-R1.

Motivation: 真实性评估语言表达与现实世界信息的关联程度，对于事实核查至关重要。这是一个复杂概念，依赖多种语言信号，需要系统的标注方案来支持相关研究。

Method: 开发了一个结合多种先前研究成果的多方面真实性标注方案，在希伯来语议会话语领域手动标注了近5000个句子，并测试了多种自动预测方法。

Result: 构建了包含近5000个句子的标注语料库，报告了标注者间一致性，并成功实验了自动预测方案以扩展标注规模。

Conclusion: 提出的真实性标注方案虽然为希伯来语开发，但可适应其他语言，为事实核查和相关研究提供了有价值的资源和工具。

Abstract: Factuality assesses the extent to which a language utterance relates to
real-world information; it determines whether utterances correspond to facts,
possibilities, or imaginary situations, and as such, it is instrumental for
fact checking. Factuality is a complex notion that relies on multiple
linguistic signals, and has been studied in various disciplines.
  We present a complex, multi-faceted annotation scheme of factuality that
combines concepts from a variety of previous works. We developed the scheme for
Hebrew, but we trust that it can be adapted to other languages. We also present
a set of almost 5,000 sentences in the domain of parliamentary discourse that
we manually annotated according to this scheme. We report on inter-annotator
agreement, and experiment with various approaches to automatically predict
(some features of) the scheme, in order to extend the annotation to a large
corpus.

TL;DR: 本研究调查了使用微调的小型语言模型(SLMs)来自动化测试项目与内容标准对齐的性能，结果显示包含更多项目文本数据能显著提升模型表现，且微调SLMs在细粒度技能对齐方面优于基于嵌入的监督机器学习模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的项目对齐由人类专家进行，这个过程主观且耗时，需要自动化解决方案来提高效率和一致性。

Method: 使用来自大学入学标准化阅读写作测试的数据，为领域和技能级别分别训练不同的SLMs，将10个技能映射到4个内容领域，并研究输入数据类型和大小对训练的影响。

Result: 包含更多项目文本数据比单纯增加样本量带来更大性能提升；微调SLMs在技能对齐方面持续优于基于嵌入的监督机器学习模型；语义相似性分析显示某些SAT和PSAT技能在语义上过于接近，解释了观察到的误分类。

Conclusion: 微调的小型语言模型在自动化测试项目对齐方面表现良好，特别是在细粒度技能对齐任务中，为测试开发提供了有效的自动化工具。

Abstract: Aligning test items to content standards is a critical step in test
development to collect validity evidence based on content. Item alignment has
typically been conducted by human experts. This judgmental process can be
subjective and time-consuming. This study investigated the performance of
fine-tuned small language models (SLMs) for automated item alignment using data
from a large-scale standardized reading and writing test for college
admissions. Different SLMs were trained for alignment at both domain and skill
levels respectively with 10 skills mapped to 4 content domains. The model
performance was evaluated in multiple criteria on two testing datasets. The
impact of types and sizes of the input data for training was investigated.
Results showed that including more item text data led to substantially better
model performance, surpassing the improvements induced by sample size increase
alone. For comparison, supervised machine learning models were trained using
the embeddings from the multilingual-E5-large-instruct model. The study results
showed that fine-tuned SLMs consistently outperformed the embedding-based
supervised machine learning models, particularly for the more fine-grained
skill alignment. To better understand model misclassifications, multiple
semantic similarity analysis including pairwise cosine similarity,
Kullback-Leibler divergence of embedding distributions, and two-dimension
projections of item embeddings were conducted. These analyses consistently
showed that certain skills in SAT and PSAT were semantically too close,
providing evidence for the observed misclassification.

TL;DR: 提出了PACO框架，通过自适应规划解决多属性可控摘要任务，使用蒙特卡洛树搜索动态确定属性控制顺序，无需训练即可实现多属性约束的满足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控摘要方法在处理多属性时面临属性间相互依赖的挑战，且通常需要针对每个属性进行微调，限制了跨不同摘要属性的灵活性。

Method: 将任务重构为规划属性控制顺序的问题，使用定制化的蒙特卡洛树搜索，节点表示摘要，动作对应单属性调整，逐步优化需要进一步控制的属性。

Result: 在多个领域和模型上的实验表明，PACO实现了鲁棒的多属性可控性，超越了基于LLM的自规划模型和微调基线。使用Llama-3.2-1B的PACO在可控性上可与更大的Llama-3.3-70B基线相媲美。

Conclusion: PACO是一个无需训练的有效框架，能够自适应发现最优控制顺序，生成满足所有约束的摘要，在大模型上表现出优越的控制性能。

Abstract: Controllable summarization moves beyond generic outputs toward human-aligned
summaries guided by specified attributes. In practice, the interdependence
among attributes makes it challenging for language models to satisfy correlated
constraints consistently. Moreover, previous approaches often require
per-attribute fine-tuning, limiting flexibility across diverse summary
attributes. In this paper, we propose adaptive planning for multi-attribute
controllable summarization (PACO), a training-free framework that reframes the
task as planning the order of sequential attribute control with a customized
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). In PACO, nodes represent summaries, and actions
correspond to single-attribute adjustments, enabling progressive refinement of
only the attributes requiring further control. This strategy adaptively
discovers optimal control orders, ultimately producing summaries that
effectively meet all constraints. Extensive experiments across diverse domains
and models demonstrate that PACO achieves robust multi-attribute
controllability, surpassing both LLM-based self-planning models and fine-tuned
baselines. Remarkably, PACO with Llama-3.2-1B rivals the controllability of the
much larger Llama-3.3-70B baselines. With larger models, PACO achieves superior
control performance, outperforming all competitors.

Motivation: 解决当代大语言模型在创意写作中的四个关键限制：类型多样性受限、输出长度不足、叙事连贯性弱、无法强制执行复杂结构。

Method: 采用基于知识图谱的故事原型作为叙事表示，通过三层智能体工作流程：初始化阶段构建叙事骨架，生成阶段通过多智能体对话实例化故事原型，写作阶段生成多类型文本。

Result: 在广泛实验中，CreAgentive以稳定质量和低成本生成了数千章节（每100章节成本低于1美元），在10个叙事指标上持续优于强基线，接近人类创作小说的质量。

Conclusion: CreAgentive通过故事原型和智能体工作流程有效解决了长文本生成的瓶颈，在创意写作中实现了高质量、多类型、低成本的生成效果。

Abstract: We present CreAgentive, an agent workflow driven multi-category creative
generation engine that addresses four key limitations of contemporary large
language models in writing stories, drama and other categories of creatives:
restricted genre diversity, insufficient output length, weak narrative
coherence, and inability to enforce complex structural constructs. At its core,
CreAgentive employs a Story Prototype, which is a genre-agnostic, knowledge
graph-based narrative representation that decouples story logic from stylistic
realization by encoding characters, events, and environments as semantic
triples. CreAgentive engages a three-stage agent workflow that comprises: an
Initialization Stage that constructs a user-specified narrative skeleton; a
Generation Stage in which long- and short-term objectives guide multi-agent
dialogues to instantiate the Story Prototype; a Writing Stage that leverages
this prototype to produce multi-genre text with advanced structures such as
retrospection and foreshadowing. This architecture reduces storage redundancy
and overcomes the typical bottlenecks of long-form generation. In extensive
experiments, CreAgentive generates thousands of chapters with stable quality
and low cost (less than $1 per 100 chapters) using a general-purpose backbone
model. To evaluate performance, we define a two-dimensional framework with 10
narrative indicators measuring both quality and length. Results show that
CreAgentive consistently outperforms strong baselines and achieves robust
performance across diverse genres, approaching the quality of human-authored
novels.

Result: 在APPS竞争编程提交上获得>0.9的Spearman秩相关系数；在CodeNet的17种语言上平均Spearman秩相关系数>0.5；在五个经典NAS设计空间上获得最高0.46的Kendall-Tau系数。

Conclusion: RLM展示了统一语言模型在代码性能预测任务上的强大能力，能够跨多种编程语言和硬件平台进行准确的数值回归预测。

Abstract: We study code-to-metric regression: predicting numeric outcomes of code
executions, a challenging task due to the open-ended nature of programming
languages. While prior methods have resorted to heavy and domain-specific
feature engineering, we show that a single unified Regression Language Model
(RLM) can simultaneously predict directly from text, (i) the memory footprint
of code across multiple high-level languages such as Python and C++, (ii) the
latency of Triton GPU kernels, and (iii) the accuracy and speed of trained
neural networks represented in ONNX. In particular, a relatively small 300M
parameter RLM initialized from T5Gemma, obtains > 0.9 Spearman-rank on
competitive programming submissions from APPS, and a single unified model
achieves > 0.5 average Spearman-rank across 17 separate languages from CodeNet.
Furthermore, the RLM can obtain the highest average Kendall-Tau of 0.46 on five
classic NAS design spaces previously dominated by graph neural networks, and
simultaneously predict architecture latencies on numerous hardware platforms.

TL;DR: dParallel是一种简单有效的方法，通过确定性强制蒸馏训练策略，解锁扩散大语言模型的并行解码潜力，大幅减少解码步骤同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型作为自回归生成的有前景替代方案，具有并行令牌预测和更低推理延迟的优势，但其并行解码潜力尚未充分探索，现有开源模型仍需接近令牌长度的解码步骤来保证性能。

Method: 提出dParallel方法，核心是确定性强制蒸馏训练策略，通过蒸馏模型遵循原始采样轨迹，同时强制模型在掩码令牌上更快地并行达到高确定性。

Result: 在LLaDA-8B-Instruct模型上，dParallel将GSM8K的解码步骤从256减少到30，实现8.5倍加速且无性能损失；在MBPP基准上，解码步骤从256减少到24，实现10.5倍加速同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: dParallel方法能显著减少扩散大语言模型的解码步骤，大幅提升推理速度，同时维持模型性能，为高效并行解码提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have recently drawn considerable
attention within the research community as a promising alternative to
autoregressive generation, offering parallel token prediction and lower
inference latency. Yet, their parallel decoding potential remains largely
underexplored, as existing open-source models still require nearly token-length
decoding steps to ensure performance. To address this, we introduce dParallel,
a simple and effective method that unlocks the inherent parallelism of dLLMs
for fast sampling. We identify that the key bottleneck to parallel decoding
arises from the sequential certainty convergence for masked tokens. Building on
this insight, we introduce the core of our approach: certainty-forcing
distillation, a novel training strategy that distills the model to follow its
original sampling trajectories while enforcing it to achieve high certainty on
masked tokens more rapidly and in parallel. Extensive experiments across
various benchmarks demonstrate that our method can dramatically reduce the
number of decoding steps while maintaining performance. When applied to the
LLaDA-8B-Instruct model, dParallel reduces decoding steps from 256 to 30 on
GSM8K, achieving an 8.5x speedup without performance degradation. On the MBPP
benchmark, it cuts decoding steps from 256 to 24, resulting in a 10.5x speedup
while maintaining accuracy. Our code is available at

Abstract: As LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed in real-life scenarios,
existing benchmarks fail to capture their inherent complexity of handling
extensive information, leveraging diverse resources, and managing dynamic user
interactions. To address this gap, we introduce VitaBench, a challenging
benchmark that evaluates agents on versatile interactive tasks grounded in
real-world settings. Drawing from daily applications in food delivery, in-store
consumption, and online travel services, VitaBench presents agents with the
most complex life-serving simulation environment to date, comprising 66 tools.
Through a framework that eliminates domain-specific policies, we enable
flexible composition of these scenarios and tools, yielding 100 cross-scenario
tasks (main results) and 300 single-scenario tasks. Each task is derived from
multiple real user requests and requires agents to reason across temporal and
spatial dimensions, utilize complex tool sets, proactively clarify ambiguous
instructions, and track shifting user intent throughout multi-turn
conversations. Moreover, we propose a rubric-based sliding window evaluator,
enabling robust assessment of diverse solution pathways in complex environments
and stochastic interactions. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that even the
most advanced models achieve only 30% success rate on cross-scenario tasks, and
less than 50% success rate on others. Overall, we believe VitaBench will serve
as a valuable resource for advancing the development of AI agents in practical
real-world applications. The code, dataset, and leaderboard are available at

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) is reshaping multimodel models, with
speech synthesis being a prominent application. However, existing approaches
often underutilize the linguistic intelligence of these models, typically
failing to leverage their powerful instruction-following capabilities. This
limitation hinders the model's ability to follow text instructions for
controllable Text-to-Speech~(TTS). To address this, we propose a new paradigm
inspired by ``operationalism'' that decouples instruction understanding from
speech generation. We introduce BatonVoice, a framework where an LLM acts as a
``conductor'', understanding user instructions and generating a textual
``plan'' -- explicit vocal features (e.g., pitch, energy). A separate TTS
model, the ``orchestra'', then generates the speech from these features. To
realize this component, we develop BatonTTS, a TTS model trained specifically
for this task. Our experiments demonstrate that BatonVoice achieves strong
performance in controllable and emotional speech synthesis, outperforming
strong open- and closed-source baselines. Notably, our approach enables
remarkable zero-shot cross-lingual generalization, accurately applying feature
control abilities to languages unseen during post-training. This demonstrates
that objectifying speech into textual vocal features can more effectively
unlock the linguistic intelligence of LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出Matryoshka MoE训练框架，通过训练时系统性地改变激活专家数量，使MoE模型具备弹性推理能力，在不同专家数量下都能保持良好性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Top-K路由器的训练策略限制了MoE模型在弹性推理方面的潜力，当推理时改变激活专家数量时，模型性能会急剧下降。

Method: 在训练过程中系统性地改变激活专家数量，强制模型学习有意义的专家排序：排名靠前的专家协作提供基本的粗粒度能力，后续专家逐步添加更细粒度的细节。

Result: 单个M-MoE模型实现了显著的弹性，在不同专家数量下的性能与整个专家模型套件相当，但训练成本仅为后者的一小部分。

Conclusion: 该工作为大规模MoE模型的实际部署提供了更实用和适应性强的解决方案，不仅解锁了弹性推理，还支持通过在不同模型层分配不同计算预算来优化性能。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising paradigm for efficiently
scaling large language models without a proportional increase in computational
cost. However, the standard training strategy of Top-K router prevents MoE
models from realizing their full potential for elastic inference. When the
number of activated experts is altered at inference time, these models exhibit
precipitous performance degradation. In this work, we introduce Matryoshka MoE
(M-MoE), a training framework that instills a coarse-to-fine structure directly
into the expert ensemble. By systematically varying the number of activated
experts during training, M-MoE compels the model to learn a meaningful ranking:
top-ranked experts collaborate to provide essential, coarse-grained
capabilities, while subsequent experts add progressively finer-grained detail.
We explore this principle at multiple granularities, identifying a layer-wise
randomization strategy as the most effective. Our experiments demonstrate that
a single M-MoE model achieves remarkable elasticity, with its performance at
various expert counts closely matching that of an entire suite of specialist
models, but at only a fraction of the total training cost. This flexibility not
only unlocks elastic inference but also enables optimizing performance by
allocating different computational budgets to different model layers. Our work
paves the way for more practical and adaptable deployments of large-scale MoE
models.

TL;DR: OceanGym是首个面向海洋水下具身智能体的综合基准平台，旨在解决水下极端环境中的感知和决策挑战，包含8个真实任务领域和基于多模态大语言模型的统一智能体框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下环境具有低能见度、动态洋流等极端感知和决策挑战，使得智能体部署异常困难，需要专门平台来推动海洋水下AI发展。

Method: 构建包含8个真实任务领域的综合基准，采用基于多模态大语言模型的统一智能体框架，整合感知、记忆和序列决策能力，要求智能体理解光学和声纳数据，自主探索复杂环境。

Result: 实验显示最先进的多模态大语言模型驱动智能体与人类专家之间存在显著差距，突显了水下环境中感知、规划和适应性的持续困难。

Conclusion: OceanGym为开发鲁棒具身AI提供了高保真测试平台，是向现实世界自主水下航行器能力转移的关键一步，标志着向地球最后未开发领域智能操作迈出决定性步伐。

Abstract: We introduce OceanGym, the first comprehensive benchmark for ocean underwater
embodied agents, designed to advance AI in one of the most demanding real-world
environments. Unlike terrestrial or aerial domains, underwater settings present
extreme perceptual and decision-making challenges, including low visibility,
dynamic ocean currents, making effective agent deployment exceptionally
difficult. OceanGym encompasses eight realistic task domains and a unified
agent framework driven by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which
integrates perception, memory, and sequential decision-making. Agents are
required to comprehend optical and sonar data, autonomously explore complex
environments, and accomplish long-horizon objectives under these harsh
conditions. Extensive experiments reveal substantial gaps between
state-of-the-art MLLM-driven agents and human experts, highlighting the
persistent difficulty of perception, planning, and adaptability in ocean
underwater environments. By providing a high-fidelity, rigorously designed
platform, OceanGym establishes a testbed for developing robust embodied AI and
transferring these capabilities to real-world autonomous ocean underwater
vehicles, marking a decisive step toward intelligent agents capable of
operating in one of Earth's last unexplored frontiers. The code and data are
available at https://github.com/OceanGPT/OceanGym.

TL;DR: 提出了首个用于语音转文本生成模型的对比解释方法，通过分析输入频谱图的不同部分如何影响替代输出之间的选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比解释（说明AI系统为何产生某个输出而非另一个）被认为比标准解释更具信息性和可解释性，但在语音转文本生成模型中获取此类解释仍是一个开放挑战。

Method: 借鉴特征归因技术，通过分析输入频谱图的各个部分如何影响替代输出之间的选择来获得对比解释。

Result: 在语音翻译中的性别分配案例研究中，该方法能准确识别驱动选择某一性别而非另一性别的音频特征。

Conclusion: 通过将对比解释的范围扩展到语音转文本模型，为更好地理解此类模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Contrastive explanations, which indicate why an AI system produced one output
(the target) instead of another (the foil), are widely regarded in explainable
AI as more informative and interpretable than standard explanations. However,
obtaining such explanations for speech-to-text (S2T) generative models remains
an open challenge. Drawing from feature attribution techniques, we propose the
first method to obtain contrastive explanations in S2T by analyzing how parts
of the input spectrogram influence the choice between alternative outputs.
Through a case study on gender assignment in speech translation, we show that
our method accurately identifies the audio features that drive the selection of
one gender over another. By extending the scope of contrastive explanations to
S2T, our work provides a foundation for better understanding S2T models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FuncBenchGen是一个用于评估工具增强语言模型的合成基准框架，通过生成多步骤工具使用任务来避免数据污染问题，并发现LLMs在多轮工具使用中存在状态跟踪脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强语言模型基准在函数数量、任务复杂度和输入大小等因素上控制不足，且容易受到数据污染的影响。

Method: 将工具使用建模为在隐藏函数依赖DAG上的遍历，节点是函数调用，边表示函数间的输出依赖关系。用户可精确控制任务难度参数。

Result: 推理优化模型显著优于通用模型，GPT-5表现最佳。性能随依赖深度增加而急剧下降，连接的不相关函数尤其难以处理。模型常产生语法正确但参数值错误的函数调用。

Conclusion: LLMs在多轮工具使用中存在状态跟踪脆弱性，通过在每个步骤明确重述先前变量值的简单缓解策略可显著提升性能。

Abstract: As language models gain access to external tools via structured function
calls, they become increasingly more capable of solving complex, multi-step
tasks. However, existing benchmarks for tool-augmented language models (TaLMs)
provide insufficient control over factors such as the number of functions
accessible, task complexity, and input size, and remain vulnerable to data
contamination. We present FuncBenchGen, a unified, contamination-free framework
that evaluates TaLMs by generating synthetic multi-step tool-use tasks. The key
idea is to cast tool use as traversal over a hidden function-dependency DAG
where nodes are function calls and an edge between nodes represents one
function consuming the output of another. Given a set of external function
schemas, initial variable values, and a target variable, models must compose
the correct call sequence to compute the target variable. FuncBenchGen allows
users to precisely control task difficulty (e.g., graph size, dependency depth,
and distractor functions) while avoiding data leakage. We apply our
FuncBenchGen framework to evaluate seven LLMs on tool use tasks of varying
difficulty. Reasoning-optimized models consistently outperform general-purpose
models with GPT-5 significantly outperforming other models. Performance
declines sharply as dependency depth increases. Furthermore, connected
irrelevant functions prove especially difficult to handle. We find that strong
models often make syntactically valid function calls but propagate incorrect or
stale argument values across steps, revealing brittle state tracking by LLMs in
multi-turn tool use. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a simple
mitigation strategy that explicitly restates prior variable values to the agent
at each step. Surprisingly, this lightweight change yields substantial gains
across models. e.g., yielding a success rate improvement from 62.5% to 81.3%
for GPT-5.

TL;DR: MT-breaker是一种使用大语言模型迭代优化源文本以增加翻译难度的方法，通过查询目标机器翻译模型来生成更具挑战性但保持自然多样性的测试用例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的机器翻译基准很快过时，因为大多数例子对最先进的翻译模型来说太容易，限制了基准区分模型优劣和揭示弱点的能力。现有的困难测试用例创建方法在识别困难示例或保持多样性自然性方面存在不足。

Method: 受人类专家探测模型失败迭代过程的启发，提出MT-breaker方法：使用大语言模型迭代优化源文本以增加翻译难度，通过查询目标机器翻译模型来指导生成困难示例。

Result: 该方法生成的示例对目标MT模型更具挑战性，同时保持自然文本的多样性。虽然示例在生成过程中针对特定机器翻译模型定制，但难度也能迁移到其他模型和语言。

Conclusion: MT-breaker方法能够有效生成具有挑战性的机器翻译测试用例，解决了现有基准过时和测试用例创建方法不足的问题。

Abstract: Machine translation benchmarks sourced from the real world are quickly
obsoleted, due to most examples being easy for state-of-the-art translation
models. This limits the benchmark's ability to distinguish which model is
better or to reveal models' weaknesses. Current methods for creating difficult
test cases, such as subsampling or from-scratch synthesis, either fall short of
identifying difficult examples or suffer from a lack of diversity and
naturalness. Inspired by the iterative process of human experts probing for
model failures, we propose MT-breaker, a method where a large language model
iteratively refines a source text to increase its translation difficulty. The
LLM iteratively queries a target machine translation model to guide its
generation of difficult examples. Our approach generates examples that are more
challenging for the target MT model while preserving the diversity of natural
texts. While the examples are tailored to a particular machine translation
model during the generation, the difficulty also transfers to other models and
languages.

TL;DR: LLM生成的基准测试存在自我偏见，会系统性偏向生成该基准的模型，特别是在低资源语言的英译任务中。这种偏见来自生成的测试数据和评估方法两方面，且与模型在源语言的生成能力相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM开始饱和现有基准，使用LLM自动创建基准成为可扩展的替代方案，但需要验证这些生成基准的可靠性。

Method: 研究了LLM作为基准（包括测试集生成和评估）在翻译任务中的表现，分析了偏见来源和影响因素。

Result: 发现LLM生成的基准存在系统性自我偏见，偏见程度与模型在源语言的生成能力相关，低多样性的源文本是偏见的一个原因。

Conclusion: 提高生成源文本的多样性可以缓解部分自我偏见，需要谨慎使用LLM生成的基准进行模型评估。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) begin to saturate existing benchmarks,
automated benchmark creation using LLMs (LLM as a benchmark) has emerged as a
scalable alternative to slow and costly human curation. While these generated
test sets have to potential to cheaply rank models, we demonstrate a critical
flaw. LLM generated benchmarks systematically favor the model that created the
benchmark, they exhibit self bias on low resource languages to English
translation tasks. We show three key findings on automatic benchmarking of LLMs
for translation: First, this bias originates from two sources: the generated
test data (LLM as a testset) and the evaluation method (LLM as an evaluator),
with their combination amplifying the effect. Second, self bias in LLM as a
benchmark is heavily influenced by the model's generation capabilities in the
source language. For instance, we observe more pronounced bias in into English
translation, where the model's generation system is developed, than in out of
English translation tasks. Third, we observe that low diversity in source text
is one attribution to self bias. Our results suggest that improving the
diversity of these generated source texts can mitigate some of the observed
self bias.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保大型语言模型在多语言环境下的响应质量达到母语水平具有挑战性，需要开发可扩展的多语言评估框架。

Method: 引入MENLO评估框架，基于受众设计机制创建人工标注数据集，采用成对评估和结构化标注标准，结合强化学习、奖励塑造和多任务学习进行微调。

Result: 零样本LLM评估器在成对评估中表现显著改善，但仍不及人工标注者；通过强化学习训练的评估器可作为生成奖励模型提升LLM多语言能力，但与人类判断仍存在差异。

Conclusion: MENLO为可扩展的多语言评估和偏好对齐提供了有前景的方向，发布了数据集和评估框架以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Ensuring native-like quality of large language model (LLM) responses across
many languages is challenging. To address this, we introduce MENLO, a framework
that operationalizes the evaluation of native-like response quality based on
audience design-inspired mechanisms. Using MENLO, we create a dataset of 6,423
human-annotated prompt-response preference pairs covering four quality
dimensions with high inter-annotator agreement in 47 language varieties. Our
evaluation reveals that zero-shot LLM judges benefit significantly from
pairwise evaluation and our structured annotation rubrics, yet they still
underperform human annotators on our dataset. We demonstrate substantial
improvements through fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, reward shaping,
and multi-task learning approaches. Additionally, we show that RL-trained
judges can serve as generative reward models to enhance LLMs' multilingual
proficiency, though discrepancies with human judgment remain. Our findings
suggest promising directions for scalable multilingual evaluation and
preference alignment. We release our dataset and evaluation framework to
support further research in multilingual LLM evaluation.

Motivation: 解决现有AI科学家系统缺乏针对性、难以产生具有科学价值贡献的问题，专注于解决人类定义的紧迫挑战。

Method: 将科学发现形式化为贝叶斯优化问题，采用"假设-验证-分析"的分层评估流程，利用累积发现记忆智能平衡探索与利用。

Result: 消耗超过20,000 GPU小时，生成约5,000个独特科学想法，实验验证约1,100个，在三个前沿AI任务上分别超越人类SOTA方法183.7%、1.9%和7.9%。

Conclusion: 这是首个大规模证据表明AI能够实现逐步超越人类SOTA的科学发现，真正推动科学发现前沿，所有实验日志和系统代码将开源。

Abstract: While previous AI Scientist systems can generate novel findings, they often
lack the focus to produce scientifically valuable contributions that address
pressing human-defined challenges. We introduce DeepScientist, a system
designed to overcome this by conducting goal-oriented, fully autonomous
scientific discovery over month-long timelines. It formalizes discovery as a
Bayesian Optimization problem, operationalized through a hierarchical
evaluation process consisting of "hypothesize, verify, and analyze". Leveraging
a cumulative Findings Memory, this loop intelligently balances the exploration
of novel hypotheses with exploitation, selectively promoting the most promising
findings to higher-fidelity levels of validation. Consuming over 20,000 GPU
hours, the system generated about 5,000 unique scientific ideas and
experimentally validated approximately 1100 of them, ultimately surpassing
human-designed state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three frontier AI tasks by
183.7\%, 1.9\%, and 7.9\%. This work provides the first large-scale evidence of
an AI achieving discoveries that progressively surpass human SOTA on scientific
tasks, producing valuable findings that genuinely push the frontier of
scientific discovery. To facilitate further research into this process, we will
open-source all experimental logs and system code at

TL;DR: 本文提出将寻找最具挑战性NLP测试数据的问题建模为多臂老虎机问题，通过高效的采样策略在有限计算预算内识别最困难的主题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP模型需要具有足够挑战性的测试数据，但直接从海量互联网主题中寻找最困难的主题计算成本过高，因为主题与实例难度之间存在随机性关系。

Method: 将每个主题视为老虎机的一个臂，拉动臂（采样成本）涉及抽取单个实例、评估其难度，使用多臂老虎机策略在固定计算预算内高效识别最困难主题。

Result: 在机器翻译任务中，各种老虎机策略显著优于暴力搜索等基线方法，能够更有效地找到最具挑战性的主题。

Conclusion: 多臂老虎机框架为寻找最具挑战性的NLP测试数据提供了一种计算高效的方法，能够在大规模主题空间中有效识别困难主题。

Abstract: NLP models require test data that are sufficiently challenging. The
difficulty of an example is linked to the topic it originates from (''seed
topic''). The relationship between the topic and the difficulty of its
instances is stochastic in nature: an example about a difficult topic can
happen to be easy, and vice versa. At the scale of the Internet, there are tens
of thousands of potential topics, and finding the most difficult one by drawing
and evaluating a large number of examples across all topics is computationally
infeasible. We formalize this task and treat it as a multi-armed bandit
problem. In this framework, each topic is an ''arm,'' and pulling an arm (at a
cost) involves drawing a single example, evaluating it, and measuring its
difficulty. The goal is to efficiently identify the most difficult topics
within a fixed computational budget. We illustrate the bandit problem setup of
finding difficult examples for the task of machine translation. We find that
various bandit strategies vastly outperform baseline methods like brute-force
searching the most challenging topics.

Motivation: 传统口语语言模型使用高帧率语音标记，导致序列过长，Transformer的自注意力计算成本高昂。音节级标记化能显著压缩标记长度(4-5Hz)，但尚未在口语语言建模中得到充分探索。

Method: 对音节标记化在口语语言建模中进行系统性研究，在不同训练数据规模下评估模型在一系列口语理解基准上的表现。

Result: 音节标记在性能上匹配甚至超越传统高帧率标记，同时显著降低训练和推理成本：训练时间减少2倍以上，FLOPs减少5倍。

Conclusion: 音节级语言建模是实现高效长上下文口语语言模型的有前景路径。

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) typically discretize speech into
high-frame-rate tokens extracted from SSL speech models. As the most successful
LMs are based on the Transformer architecture, processing these long token
streams with self-attention is expensive, as attention scales quadratically
with sequence length. A recent SSL work introduces acoustic tokenization of
speech at the syllable level, which is more interpretable and potentially more
scalable with significant compression in token lengths (4-5 Hz). Yet, their
value for spoken language modeling is not yet fully explored. We present the
first systematic study of syllabic tokenization for spoken language modeling,
evaluating models on a suite of SLU benchmarks while varying training data
scale. Syllabic tokens can match or surpass the previous high-frame rate tokens
while significantly cutting training and inference costs, achieving more than a
2x reduction in training time and a 5x reduction in FLOPs. Our findings
highlight syllable-level language modeling as a promising path to efficient
long-context spoken language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型在不同随机种子下的收敛特性，了解模型训练过程中分布稳定性的影响因素。

Method: 通过测量不同随机种子下语言模型的期望每标记KL散度来评估收敛性，分析模型大小、训练检查点、标记频率和词性标签对收敛的影响。

Result: 识别出四阶段收敛模式：初始均匀阶段、急剧收敛阶段、急剧发散阶段和缓慢重收敛阶段；发现大模型在后期训练阶段重收敛更快，小模型无法真正重收敛；高频标记和功能词比低频标记和内容词收敛更快更稳定。

Conclusion: 模型大小是学习稳定分布的必要条件，收敛在不同语言类别中是不均匀的，这些发现有助于理解语言模型训练中学习分布稳定性的影响因素。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the convergence of language models (LMs)
trained under different random seeds, measuring convergence as the expected
per-token Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence across seeds. By comparing LM
convergence as a function of model size and training checkpoint, we identify a
four-phase convergence pattern: (i) an initial uniform phase, (ii) a
sharp-convergence phase, (iii) a sharp-divergence phase, and (iv) a
slow-reconvergence phase. Further, we observe that larger models reconverge
faster in later training stages, while smaller models never actually
reconverge; these results suggest that a certain model size may be necessary to
learn stable distributions. Restricting our analysis to specific token
frequencies or part-of-speech (PoS) tags further reveals that convergence is
uneven across linguistic categories: frequent tokens and function words
converge faster and more reliably than their counterparts (infrequent tokens
and content words). Overall, our findings highlight factors that influence the
stability of the learned distributions in model training.

Result: 构建了KGQAGen-10k基准（包含10,000个实例），实验表明即使最先进的KG-RAG模型在该基准上也表现不佳，突显了其暴露现有模型局限性的能力。

Conclusion: 研究主张更严格的基准构建，并将KGQAGen定位为推进KGQA评估的可扩展框架。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) systems rely on high-quality
benchmarks to evaluate complex multi-hop reasoning. However, despite their
widespread use, popular datasets such as WebQSP and CWQ suffer from critical
quality issues, including inaccurate or incomplete ground-truth annotations,
poorly constructed questions that are ambiguous, trivial, or unanswerable, and
outdated or inconsistent knowledge. Through a manual audit of 16 popular KGQA
datasets, including WebQSP and CWQ, we find that the average factual
correctness rate is only 57 %. To address these issues, we introduce KGQAGen,
an LLM-in-the-loop framework that systematically resolves these pitfalls.
KGQAGen combines structured knowledge grounding, LLM-guided generation, and
symbolic verification to produce challenging and verifiable QA instances. Using
KGQAGen, we construct KGQAGen-10k, a ten-thousand scale benchmark grounded in
Wikidata, and evaluate a diverse set of KG-RAG models. Experimental results
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on this benchmark,
highlighting its ability to expose limitations of existing models. Our findings
advocate for more rigorous benchmark construction and position KGQAGen as a
scalable framework for advancing KGQA evaluation.

Abstract: Recently, machine learning has made a significant impact on de novo drug

propose SOLD (SELFIES-based Objective-driven Latent Diffusion), a novel latent
diffusion model that generates molecules in a latent space derived from 1D
SELFIES strings and conditioned on a target protein. In the process, we also
train an innovative SELFIES transformer and propose a new way to balance losses
when training multi-task machine learning models.Our model generates
high-affinity molecules for the target protein in a simple and efficient way,
while also leaving room for future improvements through the addition of more

Conclusion: 通过融入多模态语义洞察，为拼图求解建立了新范式，证明了语言上下文在增强拼图组装性能方面的重要价值。

Abstract: Jigsaw puzzle solving remains challenging in computer vision, requiring an
understanding of both local fragment details and global spatial relationships.
While most traditional approaches only focus on visual cues like edge matching
and visual coherence, few methods explore natural language descriptions for
semantic guidance in challenging scenarios, especially for eroded gap puzzles.
We propose a vision-language framework that leverages textual context to
enhance puzzle assembly performance. Our approach centers on the
Vision-Language Hierarchical Semantic Alignment (VLHSA) module, which aligns
visual patches with textual descriptions through multi-level semantic matching
from local tokens to global context. Also, a multimodal architecture that
combines dual visual encoders with language features for cross-modal reasoning
is integrated into this module. Experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models across various datasets,
achieving substantial improvements, including a 14.2 percentage point gain in

*Jin Li,Zhebo Wang,Tianliang Lu,Mohan Li,Wenpeng Xing,Meng Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Spectral Logit Sculpting (SLS)方法，通过谱分析和熵特性动态调制token分布，在推理时优化LLM输出，无需更新模型参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于熵的推理方法存在计算开销大、未能有效利用历史token上下文的问题，需要更轻量高效的优化方法。

Method: 维护top-K logits滑动缓冲区，进行实时SVD识别主导谱方向，基于熵和logit间隙统计自适应重新缩放logits，仅在高不确定性时激活。

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中，SLS始终优于现有基线方法，在数学、编程和科学推理任务中实现更优准确率。

Conclusion: SLS是一种轻量级推理时优化方法，能有效锐化输出分布同时保持上下文一致性，显著提升LLM可靠性。

Abstract: Entropy-based inference methods have gained traction for improving the
reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, many existing approaches,
such as entropy minimization techniques, suffer from high computational
overhead and fail to leverage historical token context effectively. To address
these limitations, we propose Spectral Logit Sculpting (SLS), a lightweight
inference-time optimization method that dynamically modulates token
distributions using spectral and entropic properties of recent logits. SLS
maintains a sliding buffer of top-K logits, performs on-the-fly Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to identify dominant spectral directions, and adaptively
rescales logits based on both entropy and logit gap statistics--only activating
when uncertainty is high. Without updating any model parameters, SLS
effectively sharpens the output distribution while preserving contextual
consistency. Experimental results on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate
that SLS consistently outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving superior
accuracy in mathematical, coding, and scientific reasoning tasks.

*Daksh Pandey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Poly-GRACE框架，实现与同态加密兼容的图自监督学习，使用全多项式友好的GCN编码器和多项式对比损失函数，在隐私保护下达到与标准方法相当甚至更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法如GRACE与同态加密等隐私保护技术不兼容，因为它们依赖非多项式操作，限制了隐私保护图表示学习的实际应用。

Method: 开发了全多项式友好的图卷积网络编码器和基于多项式的对比损失函数，使整个框架与同态加密兼容。

Result: 在Cora、CiteSeer和PubMed三个基准数据集上的实验表明，Poly-GRACE不仅支持隐私预训练，而且在CiteSeer上性能优于标准非隐私基线，在其他数据集上也具有高度竞争力。

Conclusion: 这项工作为实现实用且高性能的隐私保护图表示学习迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
learning representations on graph data without requiring manual labels.
However, leading SSL methods like GRACE are fundamentally incompatible with
privacy-preserving technologies such as Homomorphic Encryption (HE) due to
their reliance on non-polynomial operations. This paper introduces Poly-GRACE,
a novel framework for HE-compatible self-supervised learning on graphs. Our
approach consists of a fully polynomial-friendly Graph Convolutional Network
(GCN) encoder and a novel, polynomial-based contrastive loss function. Through
experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Cora, CiteSeer, and PubMed -- we
demonstrate that Poly-GRACE not only enables private pre-training but also
achieves performance that is highly competitive with, and in the case of
CiteSeer, superior to the standard non-private baseline. Our work represents a
significant step towards practical and high-performance privacy-preserving
graph representation learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了在双曲流形上的优化方法，包括双曲随机梯度下降和双曲Adam优化器，并展示了在扩散模型中应用这些方法可以加速收敛而不损失生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于黎曼优化原理，将优化方法扩展到双曲流形上，特别是在庞加莱球上的学习，这种优化方法鼓励学习庞加莱嵌入，从而在训练早期阶段当参数远离最优值时加速收敛。

Method: 扩展了双曲随机梯度下降（黎曼SGD的特化）到双曲Adam优化器，并在扩散模型中应用双曲优化方法，结合朗之万动力学的双曲时间离散化。

Result: 在特定数据集上，使用双曲优化方法的扩散模型实现了更快的收敛速度，同时没有牺牲生成质量。

Conclusion: 双曲优化方法在非欧几里得设置中具有优势，特别是在训练早期阶段能够加速收敛，为在双曲流形上的学习提供了有效的优化工具。

Abstract: This work explores optimization methods on hyperbolic manifolds. Building on
Riemannian optimization principles, we extend the Hyperbolic Stochastic
Gradient Descent (a specialization of Riemannian SGD) to a Hyperbolic Adam
optimizer. While these methods are particularly relevant for learning on the
Poincar\'e ball, they may also provide benefits in Euclidean and other
non-Euclidean settings, as the chosen optimization encourages the learning of
Poincar\'e embeddings. This representation, in turn, accelerates convergence in
the early stages of training, when parameters are far from the optimum. As a
case study, we train diffusion models using the hyperbolic optimization methods
with hyperbolic time-discretization of the Langevin dynamics, and show that
they achieve faster convergence on certain datasets without sacrificing
generative quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DPSformer通过长尾学习范式解决强降雨预测问题，使用高分辨率分支增强对罕见强降雨事件的表征，显著提升了强降雨预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强降雨预测对社会至关重要，但降水数据存在高度不平衡分布（大部分无雨或小雨，强降雨罕见），这种长尾分布阻碍了深度学习模型有效预测强降雨事件。

Method: 将降雨预测明确视为长尾学习问题，提出DPSformer模型，通过高分辨率分支丰富强降雨事件的表征。

Result: 对于≥50mm/6h的强降雨事件，DPSformer将基准NWP模型的CSI从0.012提升至0.067；对于前1%的强降雨事件，其FSS超过0.45，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为强降雨预测建立了有效的长尾范式，为增强早期预警系统和减轻极端天气事件的社会影响提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Accurate and timely forecasting of heavy rainfall remains a critical
challenge for modern society. Precipitation exhibits a highly imbalanced
distribution: most observations record no or light rain, while heavy rainfall
events are rare. Such an imbalanced distribution obstructs deep learning models
from effectively predicting heavy rainfall events. To address this challenge,
we treat rainfall forecasting explicitly as a long-tailed learning problem,
identifying the insufficient representation of heavy rainfall events as the
primary barrier to forecasting accuracy. Therefore, we introduce DPSformer, a
long-tail-aware model that enriches representation of heavy rainfall events
through a high-resolution branch. For heavy rainfall events $ \geq $ 50 mm/6 h,
DPSformer lifts the Critical Success Index (CSI) of a baseline Numerical
Weather Prediction (NWP) model from 0.012 to 0.067. For the top 1% coverage of
heavy rainfall events, its Fraction Skill Score (FSS) exceeds 0.45, surpassing
existing methods. Our work establishes an effective long-tailed paradigm for
heavy rainfall prediction, offering a practical tool to enhance early warning
systems and mitigate the societal impacts of extreme weather events.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了STCast框架，通过空间对齐注意力机制和时序专家混合模块，实现自适应区域边界优化和动态月度预报分配，在多个天气预报任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有区域天气预报方法受限于静态不精确的区域边界，导致泛化能力差，需要解决边界优化问题。

Method: 使用空间对齐注意力机制对齐全局和区域空间分布来初始化边界，基于注意力模式自适应优化边界；设计时序专家混合模块，通过离散高斯分布将不同月份大气变量动态路由到专门专家。

Result: 实验结果表明，在全局和区域预报、极端事件预测和集合预报四个任务中，均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: STCast框架通过自适应边界优化和动态专家分配，显著提升了天气预报的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: To gain finer regional forecasts, many works have explored the regional
integration from the global atmosphere, e.g., by solving boundary equations in
physics-based methods or cropping regions from global forecasts in data-driven
methods. However, the effectiveness of these methods is often constrained by
static and imprecise regional boundaries, resulting in poor generalization
ability. To address this issue, we propose Spatial-Temporal Weather Forecasting
(STCast), a novel AI-driven framework for adaptive regional boundary
optimization and dynamic monthly forecast allocation. Specifically, our
approach employs a Spatial-Aligned Attention (SAA) mechanism, which aligns
global and regional spatial distributions to initialize boundaries and
adaptively refines them based on attention-derived alignment patterns.
Furthermore, we design a Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (TMoE) module, where
atmospheric variables from distinct months are dynamically routed to
specialized experts using a discrete Gaussian distribution, enhancing the
model's ability to capture temporal patterns. Beyond global and regional
forecasting, we evaluate our STCast on extreme event prediction and ensemble
forecasting. Experimental results demonstrate consistent superiority over
state-of-the-art methods across all four tasks.

TL;DR: LEMs是一种基于Transformer的深度学习框架，用于处理具有灵活时间边界和多重执行约束的复杂执行问题，通过解耦市场信息处理和分配决策来优化执行路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展神经VWAP执行策略，从固定时长订单推广到执行时长有最小和最大时间界限的场景，类似于股票回购合约结构。

Method: 使用TKANs、VSNs和多头注意力机制处理市场数据，独立分配网络处理不同场景的执行逻辑，实现市场信息处理与执行决策的解耦。

Result: 在日内加密货币市场和多日股票交易中，LEMs相比传统基准实现了更优的执行性能，能够在灵活时间约束内动态优化执行路径。

Conclusion: 统一模型架构能够通过单一框架部署到不同执行场景，相比资产特定方法具有显著操作优势。

Abstract: This paper introduces Large Execution Models (LEMs), a novel deep learning
framework that extends transformer-based architectures to address complex
execution problems with flexible time boundaries and multiple execution
constraints. Building upon recent advances in neural VWAP execution strategies,
LEMs generalize the approach from fixed-duration orders to scenarios where
execution duration is bounded between minimum and maximum time horizons,
similar to share buyback contract structures. The proposed architecture
decouples market information processing from execution allocation decisions: a
common feature extraction pipeline using Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(TKANs), Variable Selection Networks (VSNs), and multi-head attention
mechanisms processes market data to create informational context, while
independent allocation networks handle the specific execution logic for
different scenarios (fixed quantity vs. fixed notional, buy vs. sell orders).
This architectural separation enables a unified model to handle diverse
execution objectives while leveraging shared market understanding across
scenarios. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation on intraday
cryptocurrency markets and multi-day equity trading using DOW Jones
constituents, we demonstrate that LEMs achieve superior execution performance
compared to traditional benchmarks by dynamically optimizing execution paths
within flexible time constraints. The unified model architecture enables
deployment across different execution scenarios (buy/sell orders, varying
duration boundaries, volume/notional targets) through a single framework,
providing significant operational advantages over asset-specific approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN超参数优化通常需要大量试错或网格搜索，计算成本高昂。本研究旨在将传统质量工程中的田口实验设计方法应用于CNN超参数优化，提高优化效率。

Method: 使用L12(211)正交阵列系统评估8个超参数，开发了5种多目标优化方法，结合信噪比分析和新型对数缩放技术来统一冲突指标。

Result: 方法3（结合加权准确率和对数变换损失函数）表现最佳，达到98.84%训练准确率和86.25%验证准确率，同时保持最小损失值。学习率是最关键参数。

Conclusion: 田口实验设计方法可有效优化CNN超参数，学习率、图像尺寸和激活函数是最重要的参数，为CNN优化提供了明确的参数优先级指导。

Abstract: The optimization of hyperparameters in convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
remains a challenging and computationally expensive process, often requiring
extensive trial-and-error approaches or exhaustive grid searches. This study
introduces the application of Taguchi Design of Experiments methodology, a
statistical optimization technique traditionally used in quality engineering,
to systematically optimize CNN hyperparameters for professional boxing action
recognition. Using an L12(211) orthogonal array, eight hyperparameters
including image size, color mode, activation function, learning rate,
rescaling, shuffling, vertical flip, and horizontal flip were systematically
evaluated across twelve experimental configurations. To address the
multi-objective nature of machine learning optimization, five different
approaches were developed to simultaneously optimize training accuracy,
validation accuracy, training loss, and validation loss using Signal-to-Noise
ratio analysis. The study employed a novel logarithmic scaling technique to
unify conflicting metrics and enable comprehensive multi-quality assessment
within the Taguchi framework. Results demonstrate that Approach 3, combining
weighted accuracy metrics with logarithmically transformed loss functions,
achieved optimal performance with 98.84% training accuracy and 86.25%
validation accuracy while maintaining minimal loss values. The Taguchi analysis
revealed that learning rate emerged as the most influential parameter, followed
by image size and activation function, providing clear guidance for
hyperparameter prioritization in CNN optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoA-LoRA提出了一种动态调整LoRA适配器的方法，使其能够适应任意量化配置而无需重复微调，通过配置感知模型和帕累托优化配置搜索实现高效部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大模型在边缘设备上的部署需求增加，现有方法需要为每个量化配置单独微调LoRA适配器，这在计算上不可行且无法适应边缘设备的异构能力。

Method: 使用配置感知模型将量化配置映射到低秩调整，并通过帕累托优化配置搜索构建高质量的训练配置集。

Result: CoA-LoRA在无需额外时间成本的情况下，实现了与需要为每个配置单独微调的最先进方法相当甚至更优的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为边缘设备上的模型压缩提供了一种高效解决方案，能够在保持性能的同时显著减少计算开销。

Abstract: As increasingly large pre-trained models are released, deploying them on edge
devices for privacy-preserving applications requires effective compression.
Recent works combine quantization with the fine-tuning of high-precision LoRA
adapters, which can substantially reduce model size while mitigating the
accuracy loss from quantization. However, edge devices have inherently
heterogeneous capabilities, while performing configuration-wise fine-tuning for
every quantization setting is computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we
propose CoA-LoRA, a method that dynamically adjusts the LoRA adapter to
arbitrary quantization configurations (i.e., the per-layer bit-width choices of
a pre-trained model) without requiring repeated fine-tuning. This is
accomplished via a configuration-aware model that maps each configuration to
its low-rank adjustments. The effectiveness of this model critically depends on
the training configuration set, a collection of configurations chosen to cover
different total bit-width budgets. However, constructing a high-quality
configuration set is non-trivial. We therefore design a Pareto-based
configuration search that iteratively optimizes the training configuration set,
yielding more precise low-rank adjustments. Our experiments demonstrate that,
unlike the state-of-the-art methods that require fine-tuning a separate LoRA
adapter for each configuration, CoA-LoRA incurs no additional time cost while
achieving comparable or even superior performance to those methods.

Motivation: 现有的多元时间序列异常检测方法在处理高维数据时面临挑战，需要一种能够保持变量间关系同时提高检测性能的新方法。

Method: 基于变量间多重相关系数的聚类来识别变量子集，然后对每个子集局部执行异常检测算法，确保变量间关系不受影响。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了异常检测性能。

Conclusion: PARADISE方法通过变量分区策略有效提升了多元时间序列异常检测的准确性和效率。

Abstract: In this article, we suggest a novel non-supervised partition based anomaly
detection method for anomaly detection in multivariate time series called
PARADISE. This methodology creates a partition of the variables of the time
series while ensuring that the inter-variable relations remain untouched. This
partitioning relies on the clustering of multiple correlation coefficients
between variables to identify subsets of variables before executing anomaly
detection algorithms locally for each of those subsets. Through multiple
experimentations done on both synthetic and real datasets coming from the
literature, we show the relevance of our approach with a significant
improvement in anomaly detection performance.

Conclusion: 模型复杂度应被视为多维构造，在分析泛化行为时需要同时考虑多个维度的变化。

Abstract: Classical learning theory describes a well-characterised U-shaped
relationship between model complexity and prediction error, reflecting a
transition from underfitting in underparameterised regimes to overfitting as
complexity grows. Recent work, however, has introduced the notion of a second
descent in test error beyond the interpolation threshold-giving rise to the
so-called double descent phenomenon. While double descent has been studied
extensively in the context of deep learning, it has also been reported in
simpler models, including decision trees and gradient boosting. In this work,
we revisit these claims through the lens of classical machine learning applied
to a biological classification task: predicting isoniazid resistance in
Mycobacterium tuberculosis using whole-genome sequencing data. We
systematically vary model complexity along two orthogonal axes-learner capacity
(e.g., Pleaf, Pboost) and ensemble size (i.e., Pens)-and show that double
descent consistently emerges only when complexity is scaled jointly across
these axes. When either axis is held fixed, generalisation behaviour reverts to
classical U- or L-shaped patterns. These results are replicated on a synthetic
benchmark and support the unfolding hypothesis, which attributes double descent
to the projection of distinct generalisation regimes onto a single complexity
axis. Our findings underscore the importance of treating model complexity as a
multidimensional construct when analysing generalisation behaviour. All code

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed machine-learned framework for sensor-based flow
estimation for drone trajectories in complex urban terrain. The input is a rich
set of flow simulations at many wind conditions. The outputs are velocity and
uncertainty estimates for a target domain and subsequent sensor optimization
for minimal uncertainty. The framework has three innovations compared to
traditional flow estimators. First, the algorithm scales proportionally to the
domain complexity, making it suitable for flows that are too complex for any
monolithic reduced-order representation. Second, the framework extrapolates
beyond the training data, e.g., smaller and larger wind velocities. Last, and
perhaps most importantly, the sensor location is a free input, significantly
extending the vast majority of the literature. The key enablers are (1) a
Reynolds number-based scaling of the flow variables, (2) a physics-based domain
decomposition, (3) a cluster-based flow representation for each subdomain, (4)
an information entropy correlating the subdomains, and (5) a multi-variate
probability function relating sensor input and targeted velocity estimates.
This framework is demonstrated using drone flight paths through a
three-building cluster as a simple example. We anticipate adaptations and
applications for estimating complete cities and incorporating weather input.

Motivation: 概率图模型中的最大概率解释推理是一个基本难解问题，现有方法在处理高树宽模型时效率低下，需要更有效的加速方法。

Method: 开发可扩展的数据生成流程，从现有MPE求解器的搜索轨迹中提取训练信号，训练神经网络作为启发式函数，与搜索算法集成。

Result: 在涉及高树宽概率图模型的挑战性MPE查询上，学习到的启发式函数显著减少了搜索空间，同时保持或改进了最先进方法的解质量。

Conclusion: L2C框架成功地将学习技术应用于MPE推理加速，为处理复杂概率图模型提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce learning to condition (L2C), a scalable, data-driven framework
for accelerating Most Probable Explanation (MPE) inference in Probabilistic
Graphical Models (PGMs), a fundamentally intractable problem. L2C trains a
neural network to score variable-value assignments based on their utility for
conditioning, given observed evidence. To facilitate supervised learning, we
develop a scalable data generation pipeline that extracts training signals from
the search traces of existing MPE solvers. The trained network serves as a
heuristic that integrates with search algorithms, acting as a conditioning
strategy prior to exact inference or as a branching and node selection policy
within branch-and-bound solvers. We evaluate L2C on challenging MPE queries
involving high-treewidth PGMs. Experiments show that our learned heuristic
significantly reduces the search space while maintaining or improving solution
quality over state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: TinyML技术在计算、内存和能量方面的特定约束需要专门的优化技术，而深度神经网络之外的动态集成选择方法在TinyML中具有探索价值。

Method: 采用动态集成选择聚类方法，实现了专为嵌入式系统限制优化的TinyDES-Clustering库，用于多类计算机视觉任务。

Result: 实验表明，更大的动态选择分类器池能提高分类准确率，但会导致TinyML设备上平均推理时间的增加。

Conclusion: DES聚类方法允许调整分类准确率，从而影响延迟和能耗，在TinyML系统中需要在准确率和效率之间进行权衡。

Abstract: The recent progress in TinyML technologies triggers the need to address the
challenge of balancing inference time and classification quality. TinyML
systems are defined by specific constraints in computation, memory and energy.
These constraints emphasize the need for specialized optimization techniques
when implementing Machine Learning (ML) applications on such platforms. While
deep neural networks are widely used in TinyML, the exploration of Dynamic
Ensemble Selection (DES) methods is also beneficial. This study examines a
DES-Clustering approach for a multi-class computer vision task within TinyML
systems. This method allows for adjusting classification accuracy, thereby
affecting latency and energy consumption per inference. We implemented the
TinyDES-Clustering library, optimized for embedded system limitations.
Experiments have shown that a larger pool of classifiers for dynamic selection
improves classification accuracy, and thus leads to an increase in average
inference time on the TinyML device.

Motivation: 线性注意力虽然提供线性时间替代方案，但在捕捉长距离模式时表现不佳。现有变体存在表达能力瓶颈，仅能通过历史预测和单令牌校正的组合来工作。

Method: 引入残差线性注意力(RLA)框架，维护辅助循环状态来累积残差误差并校正基础预测。实例化残差Delta网络(RDN)，包含自适应门控和残差裁剪以增强校正控制和稳定性。

Result: 在语言建模和召回密集型评估中，RLA和RDN始终优于各自基线和现代线性注意力方法，缩小了与标准Transformer的差距，同时保持线性缩放。

Conclusion: RLA框架通过显式残差拟合机制有效解决了线性注意力的表达能力瓶颈，在保持线性时间复杂度的同时显著提升了性能表现。

Abstract: Linear attention offers a linear-time alternative to self-attention but often
struggles to capture long-range patterns. We revisit linear attention through a
prediction-correction lens and show that prevalent variants can be written as a
combination of a historical prediction and a single-token correction, which
creates an expressivity bottleneck. To address this bottleneck, we introduce
Residual Linear Attention (RLA), a framework that equips linear attention with
an explicit residual-fitting mechanism. RLA maintains an auxiliary recurrent
state that learns to accumulate residual errors over time and correct the base
prediction. We further instantiate a delta-rule version, Residual Delta Net
(RDN), incorporating adaptive gating and residual clipping for enhanced
correction control and stability. Our implementation leverages highly optimized

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AMLA是一种针对华为昇腾NPU优化的高性能内核，通过创新的FlashAttention算法和预加载流水线策略，显著提升了多头潜在注意力(MLA)的计算效率，在昇腾910 NPU上达到614 TFLOPS，性能利用率达86.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多头潜在注意力(MLA)虽然能显著减少KVCache内存使用，但引入了大量计算开销和中间变量扩展，对硬件实现特别是解码阶段提出了挑战。

Method: 1) 基于FlashAttention的新算法，用整数加法替代浮点乘法进行输出块重缩放；2) 具有分层平铺的预加载流水线策略，最大化FLOPS利用率。

Result: 在昇腾910 NPU上达到614 TFLOPS，性能利用率达86.8%，优于开源FlashMLA实现(在NVIDIA H800上利用率最高66.7%)。

Conclusion: AMLA内核已集成到华为CANN中，将很快发布，为MLA在昇腾NPU上的高效实现提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) significantly reduces KVCache memory usage
in Large Language Models while introducing substantial computational overhead
and intermediate variable expansion. This poses challenges for efficient
hardware implementation -- especially during the decode phase. This paper
introduces Ascend MLA (AMLA), a high-performance kernel specifically optimized
for Huawei's Ascend NPUs. AMLA is built on two core innovations: (1) A novel
FlashAttention-based algorithm that replaces floating-point multiplications
with integer additions for output block rescaling, leveraging binary
correspondence between FP32 and INT32 representations; (2) A Preload Pipeline
strategy with hierarchical tiling that maximizes FLOPS utilization: the Preload
Pipeline achieves Cube-bound performance, while hierarchical tiling overlaps
data movement and computation within the Cube core. Experiments show that on
Ascend 910 NPUs (integrated in CloudMatrix384), AMLA achieves up to 614 TFLOPS,
reaching 86.8% of the theoretical maximum FLOPS, outperforming the
state-of-the-art open-source FlashMLA implementation, whose FLOPS utilization
is up to 66.7% on NVIDIA H800 SXM5. The AMLA kernel has been integrated into
Huawei's CANN and will be released soon.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UQ-SONet是一个具有内置不确定性量化的置换不变算子学习框架，通过结合集合变换器嵌入和条件变分自编码器来处理稀疏传感器数据并提供不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DeepONets方法需要固定传感器配置，缺乏不确定性量化机制，且无法处理稀疏或不完整测量数据，限制了实际应用。

Method: 集成集合变换器嵌入处理可变传感器位置，使用条件变分自编码器近似解算子的条件分布，通过最小化负ELBO实现不确定性估计。

Result: 在确定性和随机偏微分方程（包括Navier-Stokes方程）上的数值实验证明了该框架的鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: UQ-SONet在保持预测精度的同时提供了原则性的不确定性估计，解决了现有算子学习方法在传感器灵活性和不确定性量化方面的局限性。

Abstract: Learning operators from data is central to scientific machine learning. While
DeepONets are widely used for their ability to handle complex domains, they
require fixed sensor numbers and locations, lack mechanisms for uncertainty
quantification (UQ), and are thus limited in practical applicability. Recent
permutationinvariant extensions, such as the Variable-Input Deep Operator
Network (VIDON), relax these sensor constraints but still rely on sufficiently
dense observations and cannot capture uncertainties arising from incomplete
measurements or from operators with inherent randomness. To address these
challenges, we propose UQ-SONet, a permutation-invariant operator learning
framework with built-in UQ. Our model integrates a set transformer embedding to
handle sparse and variable sensor locations, and employs a conditional
variational autoencoder (cVAE) to approximate the conditional distribution of
the solution operator. By minimizing the negative ELBO, UQ-SONet provides
principled uncertainty estimation while maintaining predictive accuracy.
Numerical experiments on deterministic and stochastic PDEs, including the
Navier-Stokes equation, demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MSCoD是一个基于贝叶斯更新的生成框架，用于基于结构的药物设计，通过多尺度信息瓶颈和多头协作注意力机制解决蛋白质-配体相互作用的多尺度层次结构和不对称性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于结构的药物设计方法难以捕捉蛋白质-配体相互作用的多尺度层次结构和内在不对称性，限制了准确建模复杂相互作用的能力。

Method: 提出MSCoD框架，包含多尺度信息瓶颈(MSIB)进行分层特征提取，以及多头协作注意力(MHCA)机制使用不对称的蛋白质到配体注意力来捕捉多样化相互作用类型。

Result: 在基准数据集上MSCoD优于最先进方法，在KRAS G12D等挑战性靶点的案例研究中进一步证明了其实际应用价值。

Conclusion: MSCoD通过有效建模多尺度层次特征和不对称相互作用，为基于结构的药物设计提供了更强大的计算框架。

Abstract: Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) is a powerful strategy in computational
drug discovery, utilizing three-dimensional protein structures to guide the
design of molecules with improved binding affinity. However, capturing complex
protein-ligand interactions across multiple scales remains challenging, as
current methods often overlook the hierarchical organization and intrinsic
asymmetry of these interactions. To address these limitations, we propose
MSCoD, a novel Bayesian updating-based generative framework for structure-based
drug design. In our MSCoD, Multi-Scale Information Bottleneck (MSIB) was
developed, which enables semantic compression at multiple abstraction levels
for efficient hierarchical feature extraction. Furthermore, a multi-head
cooperative attention (MHCA) mechanism was developed, which employs asymmetric
protein-to-ligand attention to capture diverse interaction types while
addressing the dimensionality disparity between proteins and ligands. Empirical
studies showed that MSCoD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark
dataset. Case studies on challenging targets such as KRAS G12D further
demonstrate its applicability in real-world scenarios. The code and data

TL;DR: FINO是一个受有限差分启发的神经架构，通过严格局部性和可学习时间步进方案解决偏微分方程，在保持多尺度表示能力的同时避免全局混合机制的过平滑问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经算子模型依赖全局混合机制（如谱卷积或注意力），容易过度平滑尖锐的局部动态且计算成本高，需要一种既能保持局部结构又能高效计算的替代方案。

Method: FINO使用可学习卷积核替代固定有限差分模板系数，通过显式可学习时间步进方案演化状态。核心局部算子块包含微分模板层、门控掩码和线性融合步骤，构建自适应导数类局部特征。

Conclusion: 严格局部性与可学习时间步进的结合为神经PDE求解器提供了准确且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Neural operator models for solving partial differential equations (PDEs)
often rely on global mixing mechanisms-such as spectral convolutions or
attention-which tend to oversmooth sharp local dynamics and introduce high
computational cost. We present FINO, a finite-difference-inspired neural
architecture that enforces strict locality while retaining multiscale
representational power. FINO replaces fixed finite-difference stencil
coefficients with learnable convolutional kernels and evolves states via an
explicit, learnable time-stepping scheme. A central Local Operator Block
leverage a differential stencil layer, a gating mask, and a linear fuse step to
construct adaptive derivative-like local features that propagate forward in
time. Embedded in an encoder-decoder with a bottleneck, FINO captures
fine-grained local structures while preserving interpretability. We establish
(i) a composition error bound linking one-step approximation error to stable
long-horizon rollouts under a Lipschitz condition, and (ii) a universal
approximation theorem for discrete time-stepped PDE dynamics. (iii) Across six
benchmarks and a climate modelling task, FINO achieves up to 44\% lower error
and up to around 2\times speedups over state-of-the-art operator-learning
baselines, demonstrating that strict locality with learnable time-stepping
yields an accurate and scalable foundation for neural PDE solvers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种贝叶斯优化的多元变分模态分解-长短期记忆网络框架，用于集成风-光-波海洋能源系统的超短期功率预测，显著提升了预测精度和自动化程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预测方法多为单能源单独建模，未能充分考虑多能源间的复杂耦合关系，且难以捕捉系统的非线性和非平稳动态特性，限制了预测性能和实用性。

Method: 使用MVMD联合分解风、光、波功率序列以保持跨源耦合关系；采用贝叶斯优化自动搜索MVMD中的模态数量和惩罚参数；最后用LSTM对得到的本征模态函数进行建模实现超短期功率预测。

Conclusion: 所提框架在预测精度、鲁棒性和自动化程度方面表现出优越性能，为集成海洋能源系统的安全运行和优化调度提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Integrated wind-solar-wave marine energy systems hold broad promise for
supplying clean electricity in offshore and coastal regions. By leveraging the
spatiotemporal complementarity of multiple resources, such systems can
effectively mitigate the intermittency and volatility of single-source outputs,
thereby substantially improving overall power-generation efficiency and
resource utilization. Accurate ultra-short-term forecasting is crucial for
ensuring secure operation and optimizing proactive dispatch. However, most
existing forecasting methods construct separate models for each energy source,
insufficiently account for the complex couplings among multiple energies,
struggle to capture the system's nonlinear and nonstationary dynamics, and
typically depend on extensive manual parameter tuning-limitations that
constrain both predictive performance and practicality. We address this issue
using a Bayesian-optimized Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition-Long
Short-Term Memory (MVMD-LSTM) framework. The framework first applies MVMD to
jointly decompose wind, solar and wave power series so as to preserve
cross-source couplings; it uses Bayesian optimization to automatically search
the number of modes and the penalty parameter in the MVMD process to obtain
intrinsic mode functions (IMFs); finally, an LSTM models the resulting IMFs to
achieve ultra-short-term power forecasting for the integrated system.
Experiments based on field measurements from an offshore integrated energy
platform in China show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms
benchmark models in terms of MAPE, RMSE and MAE. The results demonstrate
superior predictive accuracy, robustness, and degree of automation.

Motivation: 为可逆归一化流提供一个理论严谨且实用的框架，连接随机投影理论与归一化流，解决PCA流和学习的可逆映射的局限性。

Method: 使用通过高斯矩阵QR分解从Haar分布正交系综中抽取的随机半正交矩阵，将数据投影到低维潜在空间用于基分布，并提供黎曼体积校正项的闭式表达式。

Result: RPFs既是理论严谨的又是实际有效的，为生成建模提供了强大的基线方法。

Conclusion: RPFs提供了一个即插即用、高效的可逆归一化流框架，在随机投影理论和归一化流之间建立了桥梁。

Abstract: We introduce Random Projection Flows (RPFs), a principled framework for
injective normalizing flows that leverages tools from random matrix theory and
the geometry of random projections. RPFs employ random semi-orthogonal
matrices, drawn from Haar-distributed orthogonal ensembles via QR decomposition
of Gaussian matrices, to project data into lower-dimensional latent spaces for
the base distribution. Unlike PCA-based flows or learned injective maps, RPFs
are plug-and-play, efficient, and yield closed-form expressions for the
Riemannian volume correction term. We demonstrate that RPFs are both
theoretically grounded and practically effective, providing a strong baseline
for generative modeling and a bridge between random projection theory and
normalizing flows.

Abstract: A useful inductive bias for temporal data is that trajectories should stay
close to the data manifold. Traditional flow matching relies on straight
conditional paths, and flow matching methods which learn geodesics rely on RBF
kernels or nearest neighbor graphs that suffer from the curse of
dimensionality. We propose to use score matching and annealed energy
distillation to learn a metric tensor that faithfully captures the underlying
data geometry and informs more accurate flows. We demonstrate the efficacy of
this strategy on synthetic manifolds with analytic geodesics, and interpolation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列预测方法仅依赖时域或频域建模，无法充分利用多域信息；传统注意力机制容易过度关注无关历史信息，引入预测噪声。

Method: 使用小波变换进行多分辨率分析，结合时频域联合表示提取关键信息；采用维度反转的注意力机制捕捉多变量关系；引入差分注意力机制，通过两个softmax注意力矩阵的差异计算注意力分数。

Conclusion: WDformer通过小波变换和差分注意力机制，有效解决了时间序列预测中的信息利用不足和噪声干扰问题，展现出优越的性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting has various applications, such as meteorological
rainfall prediction, traffic flow analysis, financial forecasting, and
operational load monitoring for various systems. Due to the sparsity of time
series data, relying solely on time-domain or frequency-domain modeling limits
the model's ability to fully leverage multi-domain information. Moreover, when
applied to time series forecasting tasks, traditional attention mechanisms tend
to over-focus on irrelevant historical information, which may introduce noise
into the prediction process, leading to biased results. We proposed WDformer, a
wavelet-based differential Transformer model. This study employs the wavelet
transform to conduct a multi-resolution analysis of time series data. By
leveraging the advantages of joint representation in the time-frequency domain,
it accurately extracts the key information components that reflect the
essential characteristics of the data. Furthermore, we apply attention
mechanisms on inverted dimensions, allowing the attention mechanism to capture
relationships between multiple variables. When performing attention
calculations, we introduced the differential attention mechanism, which
computes the attention score by taking the difference between two separate
softmax attention matrices. This approach enables the model to focus more on
important information and reduce noise. WDformer has achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) results on multiple challenging real-world datasets, demonstrating its
accuracy and effectiveness. Code is available at

Motivation: 需要一种无需梯度、计算高效的方法来从复杂的非归一化目标密度中采样，克服传统采样方法的局限性。

Method: 采用两阶段策略：1）初始化高斯组件并从混合提议中采样；2）通过KL散度优化组件权重或参数，然后进行分层重采样。

Result: 该方法在各种密度函数上表现出良好的准确性和速度，能够产生忠实于目标的样本。

Conclusion: GMA采样器提供了一种简单有效、无需梯度的采样方法，在温和条件下具有一致性逼近性质。

Abstract: We present a family of \textit{Gaussian Mixture Approximation} (GMA) samplers
for sampling unnormalised target densities, encompassing \textit{weights-only
GMA} (W-GMA), \textit{Laplace Mixture Approximation} (LMA),
\textit{expectation-maximization GMA} (EM-GMA), and further variants. GMA
adopts a simple two-stage paradigm: (i) initialise a finite set of Gaussian
components and draw samples from a proposal mixture; (ii) fit the mixture to
the target by optimising either only the component weights or also the means
and variances, via a sample-based KL divergence objective that requires only
evaluations of the unnormalised density, followed by stratified resampling. The
method is gradient-free, and computationally efficient: it leverages the ease
of sampling from Gaussians, efficient optimisation methods (projected gradient
descent, mirror descent, and EM), and the robustness of stratified resampling
to produce samples faithful to the target. We show that this
optimisation-resampling scheme yields consistent approximations under mild
conditions, and we validate this methodology with empirical results
demonstrating accuracy and speed across diverse densities.

Motivation: 解决车联网中联邦学习面临的高数据异构性和设备异构性挑战，提升模型在动态异构环境中的性能表现。

Method: 提出FedCLF框架，包含校准损失作为参与者选择标准，以及反馈控制机制动态调整客户端采样频率。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，FedCLF相比FedAvg、Newt和Oort基线模型，在高度数据异构场景下性能提升达16%，同时通过降低采样频率提高了效率。

Conclusion: FedCLF能有效应对车联网中联邦学习的数据异构性挑战，在保证模型精度的同时优化资源利用，具有实用价值。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique that
preserves data privacy by sharing only the trained parameters instead of the
client data. This makes FL ideal for highly dynamic, heterogeneous, and
time-critical applications, in particular, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV)
networks. However, FL encounters considerable challenges in such networks owing
to the high data and device heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we
propose FedCLF, i.e., FL with Calibrated Loss and Feedback control, which
introduces calibrated loss as a utility in the participant selection process
and a feedback control mechanism to dynamically adjust the sampling frequency
of the clients. The envisaged approach (a) enhances the overall model accuracy
in case of highly heterogeneous data and (b) optimizes the resource utilization
for resource constrained IoV networks, thereby leading to increased efficiency
in the FL process. We evaluated FedCLF vis-\`a-vis baseline models, i.e.,
FedAvg, Newt, and Oort, using CIFAR-10 dataset with varying data heterogeneity.
Our results depict that FedCLF significantly outperforms the baseline models by
up to a 16% improvement in high data heterogeneity-related scenarios with
improved efficiency via reduced sampling frequency.

Abstract: Correct identification of failure mechanisms is essential for manufacturers
to ensure the quality of their products. Certain failures of printheads
developed by Canon Production Printing can be identified from the behavior of
individual nozzles, the states of which are constantly recorded and can form
distinct patterns in terms of the number of failed nozzles over time, and in
space in the nozzle grid. In our work, we investigate the problem of printhead
failure classification based on a multifaceted dataset of nozzle logging and
propose a Machine Learning classification approach for this problem. We follow
the feature-based framework of time-series classification, where a set of
time-based and spatial features was selected with the guidance of domain
experts. Several traditional ML classifiers were evaluated, and the One-vs-Rest
Random Forest was found to have the best performance. The proposed model
outperformed an in-house rule-based baseline in terms of a weighted F1 score
for several failure mechanisms.

Motivation: 现有的工具增强语言代理在真实部署中经常因工具故障（超时、API异常等）导致级联推理错误和任务放弃，现有训练方法只优化成功轨迹，无法应对现实中的故障情况。

Method: 通过系统化故障注入和专家演示在增强的ToolBench数据集上构建50,000+恢复注释轨迹，使用LoRA微调保留基础能力的同时注入恢复能力，推理时检测错误并检索55+故障示例进行恢复。

Result: PALADIN将恢复率从32.76%提升至89.68%（相对提升57%），优于最强基线CRITIC（76.34%）13.3%，在未见工具API上保持95.2%的恢复性能。

Conclusion: PALADIN是构建容错代理的有效方法，能够在真实工具环境中实现稳健的故障恢复。

Abstract: Tool-augmented language agents frequently fail in real-world deployment due
to tool malfunctions--timeouts, API exceptions, or inconsistent
outputs--triggering cascading reasoning errors and task abandonment. Existing
agent training pipelines optimize only for success trajectories, failing to
expose models to the tool failures that dominate real-world usage. We propose
\textbf{PALADIN}, a generalizable framework for equipping language agents with
robust failure recovery capabilities. PALADIN trains on 50,000+
recovery-annotated trajectories constructed via systematic failure injection
and expert demonstrations on an enhanced ToolBench dataset. Training uses
LoRA-based fine-tuning to retain base capabilities while injecting recovery
competence. At inference, PALADIN detects execution-time errors and retrieves
the most similar case from a curated bank of 55+ failure exemplars aligned with
ToolScan's taxonomy, then executes the corresponding recovery action. This
approach generalizes to novel failures beyond the training distribution,
retaining 95.2\% recovery performance on unseen tool APIs. Evaluation across
PaladinEval and ToolReflectEval demonstrates consistent improvements in
Recovery Rate (RR), Task Success Rate (TSR), Catastrophic Success Rate (CSR),
and Efficiency Score (ES). PALADIN improves RR from 32.76% to 89.68% (+57%
relative) over ToolBench and outperforms the strongest baseline CRITIC (76.34%)
by +13.3%. Against vanilla agents, PALADIN achieves 89.86\% RR (+66% relative
improvement from 23.75%). These results establish PALADIN as an effective
method for building fault-tolerant agents capable of robust recovery in
real-world tool environments.

Conclusion: 多样性驱动的排序有助于稳定收敛，HAMMER方法能有效提升LLM在课程强化学习中的性能

Abstract: Recent curriculum reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs)
typically rely on difficulty-based annotations for data filtering and ordering.
However, such methods suffer from local optimization, where continual training
on simple samples in the early steps can cause the policy to lose its
exploration. We propose a novel schema, namely Hamiltonian curiosity augmented
large language model reinforcement (HAMMER), that transfers diversity metrics,
commonly used in dataset evaluation, into the dynamic reinforcement learning
procedure, where training samples are ordered via a minimum-semantic
Hamiltonian path making the initial training retrain more exploration. From a
theoretical perspective of generalization bounds, diversity-driven ordering
facilitates stable convergence. Empirical evaluations indicate that HAMMER
stimulates model "curiosity" and consistently achieves a 3% to 4% average
accuracy gain across diverse inference benchmark.

Abstract: Recent advancements in training paradigms for Large Language Models (LLMs)
have unlocked their remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and
cross-domain generalization. While LLMs excel in tasks like programming and
mathematical problem-solving, their zero-shot performance in specialized
domains requiring expert knowledge, such as cybersecurity, is often suboptimal.
This limitation arises because foundational LLMs are designed for
general-purpose applications, constraining their ability to encapsulate
domain-specific expertise within their parameter space. To address this, we
explore fine-tuning strategies to embed cybersecurity knowledge into LLMs,
enhancing their performance in cybersecurity question-answering (Q\&A) tasks
while prioritizing computational efficiency. Specifically, we investigate
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and Quantized
Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) using a cybersecurity Q\&A dataset. Our results
demonstrate that these fine-tuning approaches significantly outperform the
foundational model in cybersecurity Q\&A tasks. Moreover, LoRA and QLoRA
achieve comparable performance to SFT with substantially lower computational
costs, offering an efficient pathway for adapting LLMs to specialized domains.
Our work highlights the potential of low-rank fine-tuning strategies to bridge
the gap between general-purpose LLMs and domain-specific applications.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a common paradigm for transferring capabilities
from larger models to smaller ones. While traditional distillation methods
leverage a probabilistic divergence over the output of the teacher and student
models, feature-based distillation methods often minimize variants of Euclidean
norms between the hidden layer representations. The main goal is for the
student to mimic the structure of the feature space of the teacher. In this
work, we theoretically show that existing feature distillation methods, such as
projection based mean squared loss or Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), cannot
capture the feature structure, even under zero loss. We then motivate the use
of Procrustes distance and the Frobenius norm of Feature Gram Matrix, distances
already common in the context of measuring representational alignment, as
distillation losses. We show that feature distillation through our method
showcases statistically significant improvement in distillation performance
across language models families (BERT and OPT) in classification and
instruction-following tasks by up to 2 percentage points, showcasing the
potential of integrating feature geometry into existing distillation methods.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted mobile crowdsensing (MCS) has
emerged as a promising paradigm for data collection. However, challenges such
as spectrum scarcity, device heterogeneity, and user mobility hinder efficient
coordination of sensing, communication, and computation. To tackle these
issues, we propose a joint optimization framework that integrates time slot
partition for sensing, communication, and computation phases, resource
allocation, and UAV 3D trajectory planning, aiming to maximize the amount of
processed sensing data. The problem is formulated as a non-convex stochastic
optimization and further modeled as a partially observable Markov decision
process (POMDP) that can be solved by multi-agent deep reinforcement learning
(MADRL) algorithm. To overcome the limitations of conventional multi-layer
perceptron (MLP) networks, we design a novel MADRL algorithm with hybrid actor
network. The newly developed method is based on heterogeneous agent proximal
policy optimization (HAPPO), empowered by convolutional neural networks (CNN)
for feature extraction and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) to capture
structured state-action dependencies. Extensive numerical results demonstrate
that our proposed method achieves significant improvements in the amount of
processed sensing data when compared with other benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了RainfallBench基准测试，专门用于0-3小时降雨临近预报，解决了现有基准测试在复杂气象场景中的不足，并开发了BFPF模块来提升降雨时间序列预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列预测基准主要针对温度、湿度等周期性强的变量，无法反映模型在降雨临近预报这种复杂气象场景中的能力，因此需要专门针对降雨临近预报的基准测试。

Method: 构建了基于5年气象观测数据的RainfallBench数据集，包含6个关键变量和可降水量(PWV)数据；设计了专门的评估策略；提出了BFPF插件模块来应对零膨胀和时间衰减问题。

Result: 评估了20多个最先进模型，验证了数据集的全面性和方法的优越性；BFPF模块有效提升了降雨时间序列预测性能。

Conclusion: RainfallBench填补了降雨临近预报基准测试的空白，BFPF模块为处理降雨预测中的特殊挑战提供了有效解决方案，对灾害缓解和实时响应规划具有重要意义。

Abstract: Rainfall nowcasting, which aims to predict precipitation within the next 0 to
3 hours, is critical for disaster mitigation and real-time response planning.
However, most time series forecasting benchmarks in meteorology are evaluated
on variables with strong periodicity, such as temperature and humidity, which
fail to reflect model capabilities in more complex and practically meteorology
scenarios like rainfall nowcasting. To address this gap, we propose
RainfallBench, a benchmark designed for rainfall nowcasting, a highly
challenging and practically relevant task characterized by zero inflation,
temporal decay, and non-stationarity, focused on predicting precipitation
within the next 0 to 3 hours. The dataset is derived from five years of
meteorological observations, recorded at 15-minute intervals across six
essential variables, and collected from more than 12,000 GNSS stations
globally. In particular, it incorporates precipitable water vapor (PWV), a
crucial indicator of rainfall that is absent in other datasets. We further
design specialized evaluation strategies to assess model performance on key
meteorological challenges, such as multi-scale prediction and extreme rainfall
events, and evaluate over 20 state-of-the-art models across six major
architectures on RainfallBench. Additionally, to address the zero-inflation and
temporal decay issues overlooked by existing models, we introduce Bi-Focus
Precipitation Forecaster (BFPF), a plug-and-play module that incorporates
domain-specific priors to enhance rainfall time series forecasting. Statistical
analysis and ablation studies validate the comprehensiveness of our dataset as
well as the superiority of our methodology. Code and datasets are available at

TL;DR: PPN是一个轻量级强化学习框架，通过自适应策略选择来优化LLM的效率和准确性平衡，相比Self-Consistency可减少61.5%的token成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态提示策略（如Zero-Shot、Few-Shot、CoT）在效率和准确性之间存在刚性权衡，准确策略如Self-Consistency在简单任务上浪费计算资源，而轻量方法在复杂输入上表现不佳。

Method: 提出Prompt Policy Network (PPN)，将自适应策略选择形式化为单步马尔可夫决策过程，使用PPO训练，并由资源显式奖励函数指导，仅在必要时分配昂贵的推理策略。

Result: 在算术推理基准测试中，PPN在效率-准确性帕累托前沿上实现优越性能，相比Self-Consistency减少61.5%的token成本，同时保持竞争性准确性。

Conclusion: PPN为成本高效的LLM部署提供了一个系统化、自适应的框架，推进了轻量级优化技术在可扩展和可持续语言模型应用中的设计。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) depends heavily on the chosen
prompting strategy, yet static approaches such as Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, or
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) impose a rigid efficiency-accuracy trade-off. Highly
accurate strategies like Self-Consistency (SC) incur substantial computational
waste on simple tasks, while lightweight methods often fail on complex inputs.
This paper introduces the Prompt Policy Network (PPN), a lightweight
reinforcement learning framework that formalizes adaptive strategy selection as
a single-step Markov Decision Process (MDP). The PPN, trained with Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) and guided by a resource-explicit reward function,
learns to allocate costly reasoning strategies only when necessary. Experiments
on arithmetic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PPN achieves superior
performance on the efficiency-accuracy Pareto front, delivering up to 61.5%
token cost reduction compared to Self-Consistency while maintaining competitive
accuracy. This work contributes a systematic, adaptive framework for
cost-efficient LLM deployment, advancing the design of lightweight optimization
techniques for scalable and sustainable language model applications.

Motivation: 天气基础模型虽然在天气预报技能上设定了新基准，但其对现代社会天气敏感基础设施的实际价值尚未充分探索。本研究旨在验证天气基础模型在电网韧性智能中的实际应用价值。

Method: 使用魁北克水电公司丰富的资产观测档案对Silurian AI的生成式预测变换器进行微调，包括输电线路气象站、风电场测风塔和结冰传感器数据，为五个电网关键变量提供超本地化预测。

Result: 在6-72小时预测时效内，定制模型超越了最先进的数值天气预报基准：温度平均绝对误差降低15%，总降水量误差降低35%，风速误差降低15%。最重要的是，在日间霜冰检测方面达到0.72的平均精度得分，这是现有操作系统不具备的能力。

Conclusion: 研究表明，天气基础模型通过少量高保真数据的后训练，可以作为下一代电网韧性智能的实用基础，为潜在的灾难性停电事件提供数小时的可操作预警。

Abstract: Weather foundation models (WFMs) have recently set new benchmarks in global
forecast skill, yet their concrete value for the weather-sensitive
infrastructure that powers modern society remains largely unexplored. In this
study, we fine-tune Silurian AI's 1.5B-parameter WFM, Generative Forecasting
Transformer (GFT), on a rich archive of Hydro-Qu\'ebec asset
observations--including transmission-line weather stations, wind-farm met-mast
streams, and icing sensors--to deliver hyper-local, asset-level forecasts for
five grid-critical variables: surface temperature, precipitation, hub-height
wind speed, wind-turbine icing risk, and rime-ice accretion on overhead
conductors. Across 6-72 h lead times, the tailored model surpasses
state-of-the-art NWP benchmarks, trimming temperature mean absolute error (MAE)
by 15%, total-precipitation MAE by 35%, and lowering wind speed MAE by 15%.
Most importantly, it attains an average precision score of 0.72 for day-ahead
rime-ice detection, a capability absent from existing operational systems,
which affords several hours of actionable warning for potentially catastrophic
outage events. These results show that WFMs, when post-trained with small
amounts of high-fidelity, can serve as a practical foundation for
next-generation grid-resilience intelligence.

TL;DR: 提出InfMasking方法，通过无限掩码策略增强多模态表示学习中的协同信息，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以有效捕捉多模态之间的完整协同信息，而协同信息是多模态表示的核心价值所在。

Method: 使用无限掩码策略随机遮蔽每个模态的大部分特征，仅保留部分信息创建具有不同协同模式的表示，通过互信息最大化对齐掩码前后的表示。

Result: 在受控实验中证明InfMasking有效增强模态间协同信息，在7个大规模真实数据集基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: InfMasking通过无限掩码策略成功提升了多模态表示学习中协同信息的提取能力，取得了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: In multimodal representation learning, synergistic interactions between
modalities not only provide complementary information but also create unique
outcomes through specific interaction patterns that no single modality could
achieve alone. Existing methods may struggle to effectively capture the full
spectrum of synergistic information, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks
where such interactions are critical. This is particularly problematic because
synergistic information constitutes the fundamental value proposition of
multimodal representation. To address this challenge, we introduce InfMasking,
a contrastive synergistic information extraction method designed to enhance
synergistic information through an \textbf{Inf}inite \textbf{Masking} strategy.
InfMasking stochastically occludes most features from each modality during
fusion, preserving only partial information to create representations with
varied synergistic patterns. Unmasked fused representations are then aligned
with masked ones through mutual information maximization to encode
comprehensive synergistic information. This infinite masking strategy enables
capturing richer interactions by exposing the model to diverse partial modality
combinations during training. As computing mutual information estimates with
infinite masking is computationally prohibitive, we derive an InfMasking loss
to approximate this calculation. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate
that InfMasking effectively enhances synergistic information between
modalities. In evaluations on large-scale real-world datasets, InfMasking
achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven benchmarks. Code is released
at https://github.com/brightest66/InfMasking.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAESTRO是一个新颖的多模态学习框架，通过动态跨模态交互、符号化标记和稀疏注意力机制，解决了现有方法对主模态依赖、成对建模和完整模态观察的假设限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态学习方法在现实世界应用中存在三个主要限制：(1)依赖单一主模态进行对齐，(2)成对的模态建模方式，(3)假设模态观察完整。这些限制阻碍了在多模态时间序列场景中的实际应用。

Method: MAESTRO框架基于任务相关性促进动态模态内和跨模态交互，利用符号化标记和自适应注意力预算构建长多模态序列，通过稀疏跨模态注意力处理，并使用稀疏专家混合机制实现不同模态组合下的黑盒专业化。

Result: 在四个不同数据集上的评估显示，MAESTRO在完整观察条件下比现有最佳多模态和多变量方法分别平均提升4%和8%；在部分观察条件下（高达40%缺失模态），平均提升9%。

Conclusion: MAESTRO的稀疏、模态感知设计在动态时间序列学习中展现出鲁棒性和高效性，为现实世界多模态应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: From clinical healthcare to daily living, continuous sensor monitoring across
multiple modalities has shown great promise for real-world intelligent
decision-making but also faces various challenges. In this work, we introduce
MAESTRO, a novel framework that overcomes key limitations of existing
multimodal learning approaches: (1) reliance on a single primary modality for
alignment, (2) pairwise modeling of modalities, and (3) assumption of complete
modality observations. These limitations hinder the applicability of these
approaches in real-world multimodal time-series settings, where primary
modality priors are often unclear, the number of modalities can be large
(making pairwise modeling impractical), and sensor failures often result in
arbitrary missing observations. At its core, MAESTRO facilitates dynamic intra-
and cross-modal interactions based on task relevance, and leverages symbolic
tokenization and adaptive attention budgeting to construct long multimodal
sequences, which are processed via sparse cross-modal attention. The resulting
cross-modal tokens are routed through a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
mechanism, enabling black-box specialization under varying modality
combinations. We evaluate MAESTRO against 10 baselines on four diverse datasets
spanning three applications, and observe average relative improvements of 4%
and 8% over the best existing multimodal and multivariate approaches,
respectively, under complete observations. Under partial observations -- with
up to 40% of missing modalities -- MAESTRO achieves an average 9% improvement.
Further analysis also demonstrates the robustness and efficiency of MAESTRO's
sparse, modality-aware design for learning from dynamic time series.

Abstract: Dynamic resource allocation in heterogeneous wireless networks (HetNets) is
challenging for traditional methods under varying user loads and channel

jointly optimises transmit power, bandwidth, and scheduling via a
multi-objective reward balancing throughput, energy efficiency, and fairness.
Using real base station coordinates, we compare Proximal Policy Optimisation
(PPO) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) against three

frameworks outperform heuristic algorithms in optimising resource allocation in
dynamic networks. These findings highlight key trade-offs in DRL design for

Conclusion: ClustRecNet通过深度学习有效解决了聚类算法选择问题，减少了对手工元特征和传统CVIs的依赖，在性能上显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: We introduce ClustRecNet - a novel deep learning (DL)-based recommendation
framework for determining the most suitable clustering algorithms for a given
dataset, addressing the long-standing challenge of clustering algorithm
selection in unsupervised learning. To enable supervised learning in this
context, we construct a comprehensive data repository comprising 34,000
synthetic datasets with diverse structural properties. Each of them was
processed using 10 popular clustering algorithms. The resulting clusterings
were assessed via the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) to establish ground truth
labels, used for training and evaluation of our DL model. The proposed network
architecture integrates convolutional, residual, and attention mechanisms to
capture both local and global structural patterns from the input data. This
design supports end-to-end training to learn compact representations of
datasets and enables direct recommendation of the most suitable clustering
algorithm, reducing reliance on handcrafted meta-features and traditional
Cluster Validity Indices (CVIs). Comprehensive experiments across synthetic and
real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our DL model consistently outperforms
conventional CVIs (e.g. Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, Davies-Bouldin, and
Dunn) as well as state-of-the-art AutoML clustering recommendation approaches
(e.g. ML2DAC, AutoCluster, and AutoML4Clust). Notably, the proposed model
achieves a 0.497 ARI improvement over the Calinski-Harabasz index on synthetic
data and a 15.3% ARI gain over the best-performing AutoML approach on
real-world data.

Conclusion: 这些结果为通过RL后训练高效扩展LLM推理能力提供了理论基础和实践指导。

Abstract: While scaling laws for large language models (LLMs) during pre-training have
been extensively studied, their behavior under reinforcement learning (RL)
post-training remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a systematic
empirical investigation of scaling behaviors in RL-based post-training, with a
particular focus on mathematical reasoning. Based on 54 experiments across
diverse model sizes and training settings, we characterize how model scale,
data volume, and computational budget interact to shape performance. Our
analysis leads to four key findings: (1). Under a fixed computational budget,
larger models trained for fewer steps consistently outperform smaller models
trained for more steps. (2). Given a fixed amount of training data, larger
models achieve superior sample efficiency, yielding lower loss. (3). In
data-constrained regimes, repeated reuse of high-quality data proves highly
effective, as final performance is primarily governed by the total number of
optimization steps rather than the uniqueness of samples. (4). These scaling
behaviors are robust across both base and instruction-tuned models, which share
similar learning dynamics (e.g., larger models show faster convergence) even
while differing in absolute accuracy. Collectively, these results provide a
principled foundation and practical guidelines for efficiently scaling the
reasoning capabilities of LLMs through RL post-training.

Motivation: 传统过采样方法如SMOTE依赖局部线性插值，在非线性生物医学数据中产生不合理的合成样本。深度生成模型如CVAE能更好捕捉非线性分布，但忽视了边界区域样本的重要性。

Conclusion: 结果表明，在复杂非线性结构主导的领域（如组学数据）中，不确定性感知的生成式过采样对不平衡学习具有重要价值。

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a major challenge in machine learning, especially for
high-dimensional biomedical data where nonlinear manifold structures dominate.
Traditional oversampling methods such as SMOTE rely on local linear
interpolation, often producing implausible synthetic samples. Deep generative
models like Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs) better capture
nonlinear distributions, but standard variants treat all minority samples
equally, neglecting the importance of uncertain, boundary-region examples
emphasized by heuristic methods like Borderline-SMOTE and ADASYN.
  We propose Local Entropy-Guided Oversampling with a CVAE (LEO-CVAE), a
generative oversampling framework that explicitly incorporates local
uncertainty into both representation learning and data generation. To quantify
uncertainty, we compute Shannon entropy over the class distribution in a
sample's neighborhood: high entropy indicates greater class overlap, serving as
a proxy for uncertainty. LEO-CVAE leverages this signal through two mechanisms:
(i) a Local Entropy-Weighted Loss (LEWL) that emphasizes robust learning in
uncertain regions, and (ii) an entropy-guided sampling strategy that
concentrates generation in these informative, class-overlapping areas.
  Applied to clinical genomics datasets (ADNI and TCGA lung cancer), LEO-CVAE
consistently improves classifier performance, outperforming both traditional
oversampling and generative baselines. These results highlight the value of
uncertainty-aware generative oversampling for imbalanced learning in domains
governed by complex nonlinear structures, such as omics data.

Motivation: 研究梯度下降在矩阵分解中的动力学行为，特别关注大步长情况下参数空间的结构变化和收敛特性，揭示临界步长附近的混沌现象。

Method: 通过理论分析推导标量-向量分解的临界步长，研究正则化对收敛边界的影响，并将分析扩展到正交初始化的通用矩阵分解情况。

Result: 发现参数空间在大步长下形成分形结构，临界步长附近极小值选择对初始化高度敏感，正则化会放大敏感性并产生分形边界。

Conclusion: 临界步长附近的梯度下降进入混沌状态，长期动态不可预测，不存在简单的隐式偏置（如平衡性、最小范数或平坦性）。

Abstract: We examine gradient descent in matrix factorization and show that under large
step sizes the parameter space develops a fractal structure. We derive the
exact critical step size for convergence in scalar-vector factorization and
show that near criticality the selected minimizer depends sensitively on the
initialization. Moreover, we show that adding regularization amplifies this
sensitivity, generating a fractal boundary between initializations that
converge and those that diverge. The analysis extends to general matrix
factorization with orthogonal initialization. Our findings reveal that
near-critical step sizes induce a chaotic regime of gradient descent where the
long-term dynamics are unpredictable and there are no simple implicit biases,
such as towards balancedness, minimum norm, or flatness.

grounding in physical principles. To address this, we first introduce a
physically motivated non-linear noising process, grounded in classical physics,
that unfolds proteins into secondary structures (e.g., alpha helices, linear
beta sheets) while preserving topological integrity--maintaining bonds, and
preventing collisions. We then integrate this process with the flow-matching
paradigm on SE(3) to model the invariant distribution of protein backbones with
high fidelity, incorporating sequence information to enable
sequence-conditioned folding and expand the generative capabilities of our
model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in unconditional protein generation, producing
more designable and novel protein structures while accurately folding monomer
sequences into precise protein conformations.

*Shane Bergsma,Nolan Dey,Joel Hestness*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了训练重评估曲线(TREC)方法，通过最终模型权重回顾性评估训练批次，发现数据放置时机对模型性能有重要影响，并证明可以提前预测TREC来优化数据课程设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据课程对LLM训练至关重要，但最优数据放置原则尚不明确，需要开发诊断工具来理解数据放置时机的影响。

Method: 引入TREC诊断方法，使用最终模型权重评估训练批次，分析不同规模模型(111M到3.9B参数)的TREC曲线，并利用AdamW的隐式EMA系数提前预测TREC。

Result: 研究表明将高质量数据放置在TREC低点能显著提升性能，通过预测已发布训练方案的TREC解释了先前消融实验结果，并在3.9B参数模型上验证了优化数据放置的效果。

Conclusion: TREC为理解数据放置时机提供了重要工具，能够预测和优化数据课程设计，提升LLM训练效率。

Abstract: Data curriculums have become central to successful LLM training, yet
principles governing optimal data placement remain unclear. We introduce the
*training re-evaluation curve (TREC)*, a diagnostic that retrospectively
evaluates training batches *using the final model weights*. The TREC
characterizes how well a trained model retains training data as a function of
*when* the data was encountered during training. Analyzing TRECs for models
from 111M to 3.9B parameters, we show that placing high-quality data at low
points on the TREC significantly improves performance. Importantly, while a
TREC is initially observable only after training, we demonstrate it can be
*predicted in advance* from AdamW's implicit EMA coefficients, enabling
proactive curriculum design. By predicting TRECs for published training
recipes, we explain prior ablations and reveal suboptimal data placements. We
also align high-quality data with TREC minima in order to improve continual
pre-training of a 3.9B-parameter LLM trained on 900B tokens.

TL;DR: FCRN是一个统一的深度学习框架，用于竞争风险下的离散时间生存分析，能够无缝集成功能协变量并处理缺失数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在重症监护等场景中，需要处理功能协变量和缺失数据，传统方法难以有效整合这些因素进行生存分析。

Method: 结合微网络基础层用于功能数据表示和基于梯度的插补模块，FCRN同时学习插补缺失值和预测事件特定风险。

Result: 在多个模拟数据集和真实世界ICU案例研究中，FCRN相比随机生存森林和传统竞争风险模型显著提高了预测准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过更有效地捕捉动态风险因素和静态预测因子，同时适应不规则和不完整数据，推进了重症监护中的预后建模。

Abstract: We introduce the Functional Competing Risk Net (FCRN), a unified
deep-learning framework for discrete-time survival analysis under competing
risks, which seamlessly integrates functional covariates and handles missing
data within an end-to-end model. By combining a micro-network Basis Layer for
functional data representation with a gradient-based imputation module, FCRN
simultaneously learns to impute missing values and predict event-specific
hazards. Evaluated on multiple simulated datasets and a real-world ICU case
study using the MIMIC-IV and Cleveland Clinic datasets, FCRN demonstrates
substantial improvements in prediction accuracy over random survival forests
and traditional competing risks models. This approach advances prognostic
modeling in critical care by more effectively capturing dynamic risk factors
and static predictors while accommodating irregular and incomplete data.

Motivation: 探索变分自编码器混合高斯模型在引力波数据GW150914上的潜在空间结构，评估生成模型潜在表示的可信度。

Method: 使用哈密顿蒙特卡洛从干净输入中抽取后验样本，与编码器从噪声数据输出的结果进行统计比较。

Result: 模型能够准确重建信号，但潜在空间的统计比较显示出明显的不匹配，表明强大的去噪性能不一定意味着潜在表示可靠。

Conclusion: 在评估生成模型时，基于后验的验证方法至关重要，仅凭重建性能不足以判断潜在表示的质量。

Abstract: In this work, we explore the latent space of a denoising variational
autoencoder with a mixture-of-Gaussians prior (VAE-MoG), trained on
gravitational wave data from event GW150914. To evaluate how well the model
captures the underlying structure, we use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to draw
posterior samples conditioned on clean inputs, and compare them to the
encoder's outputs from noisy data. Although the model reconstructs signals
accurately, statistical comparisons reveal a clear mismatch in the latent
space. This shows that strong denoising performance doesn't necessarily mean
the latent representations are reliable highlighting the importance of using
posterior-based validation when evaluating generative models.

Method: 将Dawid-Skene模型适配到聚类算法预测聚合中，将多个聚类算法的输出视为噪声标注进行集成。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上的实验表明，mixsemble虽不总是最佳性能，但能稳定接近最佳结果并避免差结果，表现出稳健性。

Conclusion: mixsemble在真实数据结构未知时具有实用价值，特别适合非专业用户使用，提供稳健的聚类集成方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces mixsemble, an ensemble method that adapts the
Dawid-Skene model to aggregate predictions from multiple model-based clustering
algorithms. Unlike traditional crowdsourcing, which relies on human labels, the
framework models the outputs of clustering algorithms as noisy annotations.
Experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets show that, although the
mixsemble is not always the single top performer, it consistently approaches
the best result and avoids poor outcomes. This robustness makes it a practical
alternative when the true data structure is unknown, especially for non-expert
users.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于多任务学习的贝叶斯相关向量机方法，用于提高方程发现在不同操作条件下的泛化能力，避免过拟合特定数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 方程发现面临的主要挑战是确保识别模型能在不同操作条件下泛化，而不仅仅过拟合特定数据集。特别是在结构健康监测中，不同载荷条件会揭示系统物理的不同方面。

Method: 采用多任务学习框架下的贝叶斯相关向量机，将同一结构在不同激励水平下的响应视为相关任务，共享模型参数但保留任务特定的噪声特性。

Result: 单任务RVM模型能够重现系统响应，但在激励不足时无法恢复真实控制项。而MTL-RVM通过跨任务信息组合，显著改善了弱激励和中等激励数据集下的参数恢复性能，同时在高激励下保持良好表现。

Conclusion: 多任务贝叶斯推断能够减轻方程发现中的过拟合问题，促进模型泛化能力，特别适用于结构健康监测等需要处理变化载荷条件的应用场景。

Abstract: Equation discovery provides a grey-box approach to system identification by
uncovering governing dynamics directly from observed data. However, a
persistent challenge lies in ensuring that identified models generalise across
operating conditions rather than over-fitting to specific datasets. This work
investigates this issue by applying a Bayesian relevance vector machine (RVM)
within a multi-task learning (MTL) framework for simultaneous parameter
identification across multiple datasets. In this formulation, responses from
the same structure under different excitation levels are treated as related
tasks that share model parameters but retain task-specific noise
characteristics. A simulated single degree-of-freedom oscillator with linear
and cubic stiffness provided the case study, with datasets generated under
three excitation regimes. Standard single-task RVM models were able to
reproduce system responses but often failed to recover the true governing terms
when excitations insufficiently stimulated non-linear dynamics. By contrast,
the MTL-RVM combined information across tasks, improving parameter recovery for
weakly and moderately excited datasets, while maintaining strong performance
under high excitation. These findings demonstrate that multi-task Bayesian
inference can mitigate over-fitting and promote generalisation in equation
discovery. The approach is particularly relevant to structural health
monitoring, where varying load conditions reveal complementary aspects of
system physics.

TL;DR: FlashOmni是一个统一的稀疏注意力引擎，通过引入灵活的稀疏符号来标准化各种稀疏策略的表示，能够在单个注意力内核中执行多样化的稀疏计算，显著加速多模态扩散变换器的推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态扩散变换器(DiTs)在视觉合成方面表现出色，但其部署受到高计算需求的限制。现有的稀疏加速方法需要定制化内核，限制了通用性。

Method: 提出FlashOmni统一稀疏注意力引擎，引入灵活稀疏符号标准化各种稀疏策略表示，设计优化的稀疏GEMMs用于注意力块，利用稀疏符号消除冗余计算。

Result: FlashOmni在注意力和GEMM-Q中实现接近线性的加速比(1:1)，在GEMM-O中实现2.5-3.8倍加速(达到理论极限的87.5%)。应用多粒度稀疏策略时，Hunyuan模型(33K)实现约1.5倍端到端加速且视觉质量不下降。

Conclusion: FlashOmni提供了一个通用且高效的稀疏注意力解决方案，能够显著加速DiT模型的推理过程，同时保持视觉质量。

Abstract: Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) demonstrate exceptional
capabilities in visual synthesis, yet their deployment remains constrained by
substantial computational demands. To alleviate this bottleneck, many
sparsity-based acceleration methods have been proposed. However, their diverse
sparsity patterns often require customized kernels for high-performance
inference, limiting universality. We propose FlashOmni, a unified sparse
attention engine compatible with arbitrary DiT architectures. FlashOmni
introduces flexible sparse symbols to standardize the representation of a wide
range of sparsity strategies, such as feature caching and block-sparse
skipping. This unified abstraction enables the execution of diverse sparse
computations within a single attention kernel. In addition, FlashOmni designs
optimized sparse GEMMs for attention blocks, leveraging sparse symbols to
eliminate redundant computations and further improve efficiency. Experiments
demonstrate that FlashOmni delivers near-linear, closely matching the sparsity
ratio speedup (1:1) in attention and GEMM-$Q$, and achieves
2.5$\times$-3.8$\times$ acceleration in GEMM-$O$ (max peaking at about 87.5% of
the theoretical limit). Applied with a multi-granularity sparsity strategy, it
enables the Hunyuan model (33K) to achieve about 1.5$\times$ end-to-end
acceleration without degrading visual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视多LoRA适配器中A矩阵高度相似的现象，发现这主要源于相同的初始化而非共享知识，而B矩阵在知识编码和传递中起更关键作用。

Method: 提出ALoRA（非对称多LoRA设计，多个A矩阵共享单个B矩阵）和Fed-ALoRA（在联邦学习中跨客户端共享B矩阵），通过矩阵分解策略处理异构秩问题。

Result: 在常识推理、数学推理、多任务NLP数据集和联邦NLP数据集上的实验表明，相比现有多LoRA方法，该方法在保持相当或更优平均准确率的同时，实现了跨任务更平衡的性能。

Conclusion: ALoRA和Fed-ALoRA通过非对称设计有效提升了多任务和联邦学习中的性能平衡性，验证了B矩阵在知识传递中的关键作用。

Abstract: Large language models are often adapted using parameter-efficient techniques
such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), formulated as $y = W_0x + BAx$, where $W_0$
is the pre-trained parameters and $x$ is the input to the adapted layer. While
multi-adapter extensions often employ multiple LoRAs, prior studies suggest
that the inner $A$ matrices are highly similar during training and thus
suitable for sharing. We revisit this phenomenon and find that this similarity
is largely attributable to the identical initialization rather than shared
knowledge, with $B$ playing a more critical role in knowledge encoding and
transfer. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textbf{ALoRA}, an asymmetric
multi-LoRA design with multiple $A$ matrices and a single shared $B$ in
multi-task fine-tuning, and \textbf{Fed-ALoRA}, which shares $B$ across clients
in federated fine-tuning under both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings,
through a novel matrix decomposition strategy to accommodate heterogeneous
ranks across clients. Experiments on commonsense reasoning, math reasoning,
multi-task NLP dataset, and federated NLP dataset demonstrate that our methods
achieve more balanced performance across tasks with comparable or superior
average accuracy relative to existing multi-LoRA approaches. Codes are
available at https://github.com/OptMN-Lab/ALoRA.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对时序图神经网络的新型黑盒攻击框架HIA，通过识别结构重要性和动态重要性节点，结合边注入和删除策略，显著降低TGNN性能，同时保持攻击的隐蔽性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有STDG攻击方法依赖简单扰动且容易被检测，无法战略性攻击最具影响力的节点和边来最大化影响。TGNN在动态图分析中的鲁棒性面临挑战。

Method: 使用数据驱动的代理模型识别结构重要节点和动态重要节点，采用混合扰动策略结合战略性边注入和针对性边删除，最小化扰动数量以增强隐蔽性。

Result: 在5个真实数据集和4种TGNN架构上的实验表明，HIA显著降低链接预测任务的准确率，MRR最多下降35.55%，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 结果揭示了当前STDG模型的基本漏洞，强调了开发同时考虑结构和时间动态的鲁棒防御的紧迫需求。

Abstract: Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have become indispensable for
analyzing dynamic graphs in critical applications such as social networks,
communication systems, and financial networks. However, the robustness of TGNNs
against adversarial attacks, particularly sophisticated attacks that exploit
the temporal dimension, remains a significant challenge. Existing attack
methods for Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Graphs (STDGs) often rely on simplistic,
easily detectable perturbations (e.g., random edge additions/deletions) and
fail to strategically target the most influential nodes and edges for maximum
impact. We introduce the High Impact Attack (HIA), a novel restricted black-box
attack framework specifically designed to overcome these limitations and expose
critical vulnerabilities in TGNNs. HIA leverages a data-driven surrogate model
to identify structurally important nodes (central to network connectivity) and
dynamically important nodes (critical for the graph's temporal evolution). It
then employs a hybrid perturbation strategy, combining strategic edge injection
(to create misleading connections) and targeted edge deletion (to disrupt
essential pathways), maximizing TGNN performance degradation. Importantly, HIA
minimizes the number of perturbations to enhance stealth, making it more
challenging to detect. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world datasets
and four representative TGNN architectures (TGN, JODIE, DySAT, and TGAT)
demonstrate that HIA significantly reduces TGNN accuracy on the link prediction
task, achieving up to a 35.55% decrease in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) - a
substantial improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. These results
highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in current STDG models and underscore the
urgent need for robust defenses that account for both structural and temporal
dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的强化学习微调方法容易导致策略多样性丧失，收敛到少数易被利用的输出，这阻碍了探索过程并限制了预训练策略能力的扩展。

Method: 使用vine采样收集策略轨迹，并修改优势函数以反映新目标下的优势，将PPO算法适配来优化polychromic目标函数。

Result: 在BabyAI、Minigrid和Algorithmic Creativity上的实验表明，该方法能可靠解决更多环境配置，在大的扰动下泛化更好，在pass@k实验中实现了更高的覆盖率。

Conclusion: polychromic目标函数能有效保持策略多样性，提升探索能力和性能，特别是在需要多种策略的任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLFT) is a dominant paradigm for
improving pretrained policies for downstream tasks. These pretrained policies,
trained on large datasets, produce generations with a broad range of promising
but unrefined behaviors. Often, a critical failure mode of RLFT arises when
policies lose this diversity and collapse into a handful of easily exploitable
outputs. This convergence hinders exploration, which is essential for expanding
the capabilities of the pretrained policy and for amplifying the benefits of
test-time compute scaling. To address this, we introduce an objective for
policy gradient methods that explicitly enforces the exploration and refinement
of diverse generations, which we call a polychromic objective. We then show how
proximal policy optimization (PPO) can be adapted to optimize this objective.
Our method (1) employs vine sampling to collect on-policy rollouts and (2)
modifies the advantage function to reflect the advantage under our new
objective. Experiments on BabyAI, Minigrid, and Algorithmic Creativity show
that our method improves success rates by reliably solving a larger set of
environment configurations and generalizes better under large perturbations.
Moreover, when given multiple attempts in pass@$k$ experiments, the policy
achieves substantially higher coverage, demonstrating its ability to maintain
and exploit a diverse repertoire of strategies.

Result: 在真实拍卖环境中，相比基线方法，预算控制误差降低13%，λ波动性降低54%，显著提升预算控制准确性和投放一致性。

Conclusion: 通过将控制理论与广告系统结合，为预算控制提供了可扩展且可靠的解决方案，特别有利于小预算广告活动。

Abstract: Budget pacing is critical in online advertising to align spend with campaign
goals under dynamic auctions. Existing pacing methods often rely on ad-hoc
parameter tuning, which can be unstable and inefficient. We propose a
principled controller that combines bucketized hysteresis with proportional
feedback to provide stable and adaptive spend control. Our method provides a
framework and analysis for parameter selection that enables accurate tracking
of desired spend rates across campaigns. Experiments in real-world auctions
demonstrate significant improvements in pacing accuracy and delivery
consistency, reducing pacing error by 13% and $\lambda$-volatility by 54%
compared to baseline method. By bridging control theory with advertising
systems, our approach offers a scalable and reliable solution for budget
pacing, with particular benefits for small-budget campaigns.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为学习进度监控（LPM）的新方法，通过奖励模型改进而非预测误差来驱动探索，有效避免智能体被环境中的不可学习随机源（noisy-TV）困住。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于内在奖励的探索方法在面对不可学习随机源时效率低下，受神经科学发现人类在探索过程中监控自身进步的启发，需要一种更高效的探索方法。

Method: 采用双网络设计：使用误差模型预测动态模型在前一迭代中的预期预测误差，利用当前迭代与前一迭代模型误差的差异来指导探索。

Result: 在基于MNIST、3D迷宫和Atari的嘈杂环境中，LPM的内在奖励收敛更快，在迷宫实验中探索更多状态，在Atari中获得更高的外在奖励。

Conclusion: LPM标志着噪声鲁棒探索的范式转变，概念简单但效果显著，为内在动机探索提供了新思路。

Abstract: When there exists an unlearnable source of randomness (noisy-TV) in the
environment, a naively intrinsic reward driven exploring agent gets stuck at
that source of randomness and fails at exploration. Intrinsic reward based on
uncertainty estimation or distribution similarity, while eventually escapes
noisy-TVs as time unfolds, suffers from poor sample efficiency and high
computational cost. Inspired by recent findings from neuroscience that humans
monitor their improvements during exploration, we propose a novel method for
intrinsically-motivated exploration, named Learning Progress Monitoring (LPM).
During exploration, LPM rewards model improvements instead of prediction error
or novelty, effectively rewards the agent for observing learnable transitions
rather than the unlearnable transitions. We introduce a dual-network design
that uses an error model to predict the expected prediction error of the
dynamics model in its previous iteration, and use the difference between the
model errors of the current iteration and previous iteration to guide
exploration. We theoretically show that the intrinsic reward of LPM is
zero-equivariant and a monotone indicator of Information Gain (IG), and that
the error model is necessary to achieve monotonicity correspondence with IG. We
empirically compared LPM against state-of-the-art baselines in noisy
environments based on MNIST, 3D maze with 160x120 RGB inputs, and Atari.
Results show that LPM's intrinsic reward converges faster, explores more states
in the maze experiment, and achieves higher extrinsic reward in Atari. This
conceptually simple approach marks a shift-of-paradigm of noise-robust
exploration. For code to reproduce our experiments, see

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经符号应用中的HMM模型计算密集且数据传输量大，通信效率低，需要压缩方法来缓解内存和带宽压力。

Method: 采用归一化量化感知的期望最大化过程进行概率模型训练，通过减少数据位宽实现压缩。

Result: Norm-Q相比传统量化方法实现更高压缩率，在LLM约束生成任务中成功将4096隐藏状态的HMM量化为8位无损失或3位可接受损失，权重压缩率达到99%。

Conclusion: Norm-Q方法能有效压缩概率符号模型，实现高压缩率且保持合理性能损失，适合在定制硬件上部署。

Abstract: Hidden Markov models (HMM) are commonly used in generation tasks and have
demonstrated strong capabilities in neuro-symbolic applications for the Markov
property. These applications leverage the strengths of neural networks and
symbolic reasoning to create robust and interpretable AI systems. However, they
may inherit and amplify the shortcomings of both approaches. Both components
require dense computation and data transfer, and their communication further
hinders performance. This paper proposes Norm-Q, a normalized linear
quantization approach for compressing probabilistic symbolic models, such as
HMMs. We reduce the bit width of the data with minimal impact, thereby
alleviating memory and bandwidth stress and enabling deployment on potential
custom hardware. Our method introduces a normalized quantization-aware
expectation maximization process for probabilistic model training. The
experimental results show that Norm-Q achieves a higher compression rate with
reasonable score loss compared to traditional quantization methods. In the case
of the constrained generation task of large language models, we successfully
quantize an HMM of 4096 hidden states to 8 bits without loss and, at most, 3
bits with acceptable loss. Notably, the Norm-Q method can achieve a compression
rate of 99% for the weights of the HMM. The code is open source at

Motivation: 解决传统自监督学习方法（如自回归和掩码建模）对噪声或混杂变量敏感的问题，将联合嵌入预测架构（JEPA）引入时间序列领域。

Method: 开发了时间序列JEPA（TS-JEPA）架构，在潜在空间进行自监督学习，避免直接重构输入中的掩码信息。

Conclusion: 这项工作为基于联合嵌入开发未来时间序列基础模型奠定了基础，展示了其作为学习通用表示的稳健基础模型的潜力。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has seen great success recently in unsupervised
representation learning, enabling breakthroughs in natural language and image
processing. However, these methods often rely on autoregressive and masked
modeling, which aim to reproduce masked information in the input, which can be
vulnerable to the presence of noise or confounding variables. To address this
problem, Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) has been introduced
with the aim to perform self-supervised learning in the latent space. To
leverage these advancements in the domain of time series, we introduce Time
Series JEPA (TS-JEPA), an architecture specifically adapted for time series
representation learning. We validate TS-JEPA on both classification and
forecasting, showing that it can match or surpass current state-of-the-art
baselines on different standard datasets. Notably, our approach demonstrates a
strong performance balance across diverse tasks, indicating its potential as a
robust foundation for learning general representations. Thus, this work lays
the groundwork for developing future time series foundation models based on
Joint Embedding.

Abstract: Generalist robot policies that can perform many tasks typically require
extensive expert data or simulations for training. In this work, we propose a
novel Data-Efficient multitask DAgger framework that distills a single
multitask policy from multiple task-specific expert policies. Our approach
significantly increases the overall task success rate by actively focusing on
tasks where the multitask policy underperforms. The core of our method is a
performance-aware scheduling strategy that tracks how much each task's learning
process benefits from the amount of data, using a Kalman filter-based estimator
to robustly decide how to allocate additional demonstrations across tasks. We
validate our approach on MetaWorld, as well as a suite of diverse
drawer-opening tasks in IsaacLab. The resulting policy attains high performance
across all tasks while using substantially fewer expert demonstrations, and the
visual policy learned with our method in simulation shows better performance
than naive DAgger and Behavior Cloning when transferring zero-shot to a real
robot without using real data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端可微的共形预测框架，用于信号时序逻辑（STL）推理，通过嵌入平滑CP层和新的损失函数，同时优化推理准确性和预测集大小，并提供统计保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有STL推理方法缺乏对推断规则的正式置信保证，而传统的共形预测通常作为后训练包装器使用，无法改进模型学习。

Method: 引入基于鲁棒性的非共形分数，将平滑CP层直接嵌入训练过程，使用新的损失函数同时优化推理准确性和CP预测集。

Result: 在基准时间序列任务上的实验表明，该方法减少了预测的不确定性（在保持高覆盖率的同时减小预测集大小），并提高了准确性（使用固定阈值时的误分类数量减少）。

Conclusion: 该方法为STL推理提供了统计保证，同时提高了可靠性和可解释性，在准确性和预测集大小方面优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Signal Temporal Logic (STL) inference seeks to extract human-interpretable
rules from time-series data, but existing methods lack formal confidence
guarantees for the inferred rules. Conformal prediction (CP) is a technique
that can provide statistical correctness guarantees, but is typically applied
as a post-training wrapper without improving model learning. Instead, we
introduce an end-to-end differentiable CP framework for STL inference that
enhances both reliability and interpretability of the resulting formulas. We
introduce a robustness-based nonconformity score, embed a smooth CP layer
directly into training, and employ a new loss function that simultaneously
optimizes inference accuracy and CP prediction sets with a single term.
Following training, an exact CP procedure delivers statistical guarantees for
the learned STL formulas. Experiments on benchmark time-series tasks show that
our approach reduces uncertainty in predictions (i.e., it achieves high
coverage while reducing prediction set size), and improves accuracy (i.e., the
number of misclassifications when using a fixed threshold) over
state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: P2Es是一个基于扩散模型的创新框架，能够从PPG信号生成临床有效的12导联心电图，解决了现有PPG方法无法重建多导联ECG的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有12导联ECG系统依赖笨重的多电极设置，限制了移动环境下的持续监测，而当前基于PPG的方法由于缺乏导联间约束和时空依赖性建模不足，无法重建多导联ECG。

Method: 提出P2Es框架，包含三个关键创新：前向过程使用频域模糊和时域噪声干扰模拟真实信号失真；反向过程使用时序多尺度生成模块和频率去模糊；利用KNN聚类和对比学习为反向过程分配亲和矩阵，实现人口统计学特定的ECG转换。

Result: 广泛的实验结果表明，P2Es在12导联ECG重建方面优于基线模型。

Conclusion: P2Es能够从PPG信号生成临床有效的12导联ECG，为心血管监测提供了更便捷的解决方案。

Abstract: The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is the gold standard for cardiovascular
monitoring, offering superior diagnostic granularity and specificity compared
to photoplethysmography (PPG). However, existing 12-lead ECG systems rely on
cumbersome multi-electrode setups, limiting sustained monitoring in ambulatory
settings, while current PPG-based methods fail to reconstruct multi-lead ECG
due to the absence of inter-lead constraints and insufficient modeling of
spatial-temporal dependencies across leads. To bridge this gap, we introduce
P2Es, an innovative demographic-aware diffusion framework designed to generate
clinically valid 12-lead ECG from PPG signals via three key innovations.
Specifically, in the forward process, we introduce frequency-domain blurring
followed by temporal noise interference to simulate real-world signal
distortions. In the reverse process, we design a temporal multi-scale
generation module followed by frequency deblurring. In particular, we leverage
KNN-based clustering combined with contrastive learning to assign affinity
matrices for the reverse process, enabling demographic-specific ECG
translation. Extensive experimental results show that P2Es outperforms baseline
models in 12-lead ECG reconstruction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PageANN是一个基于磁盘的近似最近邻搜索框架，通过页节点图结构将逻辑图节点与物理SSD页面对齐，缩短I/O遍历路径，提高大规模向量搜索的性能和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于磁盘的ANNS方法存在I/O遍历路径长、与存储I/O粒度不对齐、内存索引开销大等问题，导致显著的I/O延迟，限制了大规模向量搜索的可扩展性。

Method: PageANN引入页节点图结构，将相似向量聚类到页节点中，并设计协同优化的磁盘数据布局，结合合并技术仅存储代表性向量和拓扑信息。同时采用轻量级索引与协调的内存-磁盘数据分配策略。

Result: 实验结果显示PageANN显著优于现有最先进的磁盘ANNS方法，在不同数据集和内存预算下实现1.85x-10.83x更高的吞吐量和51.7%-91.9%更低的延迟，同时保持相当高的召回精度。

Conclusion: PageANN通过创新的页节点图结构和优化的内存管理策略，有效解决了磁盘ANNS的性能瓶颈，为大规模向量搜索提供了高效可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS), as the core of vector databases
(VectorDBs), has become widely used in modern AI and ML systems, powering
applications from information retrieval to bio-informatics. While graph-based
ANNS methods achieve high query efficiency, their scalability is constrained by
the available host memory. Recent disk-based ANNS approaches mitigate memory
usage by offloading data to Solid-State Drives (SSDs). However, they still
suffer from issues such as long I/O traversal path, misalignment with storage
I/O granularity, and high in-memory indexing overhead, leading to significant
I/O latency and ultimately limiting scalability for large-scale vector search.
  In this paper, we propose PageANN, a disk-based approximate nearest neighbor
search (ANNS) framework designed for high performance and scalability. PageANN
introduces a page-node graph structure that aligns logical graph nodes with
physical SSD pages, thereby shortening I/O traversal paths and reducing I/O
operations. Specifically, similar vectors are clustered into page nodes, and a
co-designed disk data layout leverages this structure with a merging technique
to store only representative vectors and topology information, avoiding
unnecessary reads. To further improve efficiency, we design a memory management
strategy that combines lightweight indexing with coordinated memory-disk data
allocation, maximizing host memory utilization while minimizing query latency
and storage overhead. Experimental results show that PageANN significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) disk-based ANNS methods, achieving
1.85x-10.83x higher throughput and 51.7%-91.9% lower latency across different
datasets and memory budgets, while maintaining comparable high recall accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了Mole-PAIR方法，通过偏好优化改进分子基础模型在分布外数据上的可靠性，显著提升了OOD检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子基础模型在分布外样本上不可靠，存在化学幻觉问题，限制了在药物发现等高风险领域的应用。

Method: 将OOD检测问题建模为对ID和OOD样本之间OOD亲和度的偏好优化，通过成对学习目标实现，本质上优化AUROC指标。

Result: 在五个真实分子数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提升了现有分子基础模型的OOD检测能力，在大小、支架和检测分布偏移下AUROC分别提升了45.8%、43.9%和24.3%。

Conclusion: Mole-PAIR是一个简单即插即用的模块，能有效提高分子基础模型在OOD数据上的可靠性。

Abstract: Molecular foundation models are rapidly advancing scientific discovery, but
their unreliability on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples severely limits their
application in high-stakes domains such as drug discovery and protein design. A
critical failure mode is chemical hallucination, where models make
high-confidence yet entirely incorrect predictions for unknown molecules. To
address this challenge, we introduce Molecular Preference-Aligned Instance
Ranking (Mole-PAIR), a simple, plug-and-play module that can be flexibly
integrated with existing foundation models to improve their reliability on OOD
data through cost-effective post-training. Specifically, our method formulates
the OOD detection problem as a preference optimization over the estimated OOD
affinity between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples, achieving this goal
through a pairwise learning objective. We show that this objective essentially
optimizes AUROC, which measures how consistently ID and OOD samples are ranked
by the model. Extensive experiments across five real-world molecular datasets
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the OOD detection
capabilities of existing molecular foundation models, achieving up to 45.8%,
43.9%, and 24.3% improvements in AUROC under distribution shifts of size,
scaffold, and assay, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟和混合信号集成电路设计中的晶体管尺寸优化过程需要大量人工参与，现有机器学习方法存在迭代次数多、缺乏电路设计知识等问题。

Method: 使用提示工程和思维链推理，让AI代理迭代探索设计方向、评估性能并优化解决方案，集成了LLM、电路仿真器和自定义数据分析功能。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的AI代理能够有效自动化晶体管尺寸优化过程，减少人工干预，在先进工艺节点上表现出良好的性能。

Abstract: The design of Analog and Mixed-Signal (AMS) integrated circuits (ICs) often
involves significant manual effort, especially during the transistor sizing
process. While Machine Learning techniques in Electronic Design Automation
(EDA) have shown promise in reducing complexity and minimizing human
intervention, they still face challenges such as numerous iterations and a lack
of knowledge about AMS circuit design. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs)
have demonstrated significant potential across various fields, showing a
certain level of knowledge in circuit design and indicating their potential to
automate the transistor sizing process. In this work, we propose EEsizer, an
LLM-based AI agent that integrates large language models with circuit
simulators and custom data analysis functions, enabling fully automated,
closed-loop transistor sizing without relying on external knowledge. By
employing prompt engineering and Chain-of-Thought reasoning, the agent
iteratively explores design directions, evaluates performance, and refines
solutions with minimal human intervention. We first benchmarked 8 LLMs on six
basic circuits and selected three high-performing models to optimize a
20-transistor CMOS operational amplifier, targeting multiple performance
metrics, including rail-to-rail operation from 180 nm to 90 nm technology
nodes. Notably, OpenAI o3 successfully achieved the user-intended target at 90
nm across three different test groups, with a maximum of 20 iterations,
demonstrating adaptability and robustness at advanced nodes. To assess design
robustness, we manually designed a bias circuit and performed a variation
analysis using Gaussian-distributed variations on transistor dimensions and
threshold voltages.

TL;DR: 提出基于TD-MPC2世界模型的自主血管内导航方法，在10个真实患者血管中训练单一RL智能体，相比SAC方法在多任务学习中成功率提升至65%（SAC为37%），但手术时间有所增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机械取栓术的自主导航面临血管解剖复杂性和实时决策精确性的挑战，现有RL方法在多患者血管泛化和长视野任务方面存在困难。

Method: 使用TD-MPC2模型基RL算法构建世界模型，在10个真实患者血管数据上训练单一RL智能体进行多任务血管内导航，并与SAC方法进行对比。

Result: TD-MPC2在多任务学习中平均成功率达65%，显著优于SAC的37%，路径比有明显改善，但手术时间增加，表明成功率与执行速度之间存在权衡。

Conclusion: 世界模型在改善自主血管内导航方面具有潜力，为未来可泛化的AI驱动机器人介入研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Autonomous navigation for mechanical thrombectomy (MT) remains a critical
challenge due to the complexity of vascular anatomy and the need for precise,
real-time decision-making. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches have
demonstrated potential in automating endovascular navigation, but current
methods often struggle with generalization across multiple patient vasculatures
and long-horizon tasks. We propose a world model for autonomous endovascular
navigation using TD-MPC2, a model-based RL algorithm. We trained a single RL
agent across multiple endovascular navigation tasks in ten real patient
vasculatures, comparing performance against the state-of-the-art Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC) method. Results indicate that TD-MPC2 significantly
outperforms SAC in multi-task learning, achieving a 65% mean success rate
compared to SAC's 37%, with notable improvements in path ratio. TD-MPC2
exhibited increased procedure times, suggesting a trade-off between success
rate and execution speed. These findings highlight the potential of world
models for improving autonomous endovascular navigation and lay the foundation
for future research in generalizable AI-driven robotic interventions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了半离散流匹配（SD-FM）方法，通过半离散最优传输替代批量最优传输，解决了OT-FM中Sinkhorn算法计算成本高的问题，在多个数据集上优于FM和OT-FM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OT-FM虽然理论上很有前景，但在实践中因Sinkhorn算法计算成本高（O(n²/ε²)）而未被广泛使用，特别是当批量大小n较大时。

Method: 采用半离散最优传输公式，通过SGD估计对偶势向量，然后使用最大内积搜索（MIPS）将新采样的噪声向量与数据点匹配，消除了对n/ε的二次依赖。

Result: SD-FM在所有训练指标和推理预算约束下，在多个数据集上均优于FM和OT-FM，适用于无条件/条件生成和均值流模型。

Conclusion: 半离散流匹配方法有效解决了OT-FM的计算瓶颈，实现了更好的性能，为流匹配模型提供了更实用的训练方案。

Abstract: Flow models parameterized as time-dependent velocity fields can generate data
from noise by integrating an ODE. These models are often trained using flow
matching, i.e. by sampling random pairs of noise and target points
$(\mathbf{x}_0,\mathbf{x}_1)$ and ensuring that the velocity field is aligned,
on average, with $\mathbf{x}_1-\mathbf{x}_0$ when evaluated along a segment
linking $\mathbf{x}_0$ to $\mathbf{x}_1$. While these pairs are sampled
independently by default, they can also be selected more carefully by matching
batches of $n$ noise to $n$ target points using an optimal transport (OT)
solver. Although promising in theory, the OT flow matching (OT-FM) approach is
not widely used in practice. Zhang et al. (2025) pointed out recently that
OT-FM truly starts paying off when the batch size $n$ grows significantly,
which only a multi-GPU implementation of the Sinkhorn algorithm can handle.
Unfortunately, the costs of running Sinkhorn can quickly balloon, requiring
$O(n^2/\varepsilon^2)$ operations for every $n$ pairs used to fit the velocity
field, where $\varepsilon$ is a regularization parameter that should be
typically small to yield better results. To fulfill the theoretical promises of
OT-FM, we propose to move away from batch-OT and rely instead on a semidiscrete
formulation that leverages the fact that the target dataset distribution is
usually of finite size $N$. The SD-OT problem is solved by estimating a dual
potential vector using SGD; using that vector, freshly sampled noise vectors at
train time can then be matched with data points at the cost of a maximum inner
product search (MIPS). Semidiscrete FM (SD-FM) removes the quadratic dependency
on $n/\varepsilon$ that bottlenecks OT-FM. SD-FM beats both FM and OT-FM on all
training metrics and inference budget constraints, across multiple datasets, on
unconditional/conditional generation, or when using mean-flow models.

<details>

Motivation: 在需要大量人机交互的语言任务中，为每个查询部署单一"最佳"模型成本高昂。现有路由器训练面临可靠监督数据稀缺的问题：黄金标准数据准确但昂贵，偏好数据便宜但存在偏差

Method: 将LLM路由器训练问题转化为因果推断框架，将响应评估机制视为治疗分配，识别偏好数据偏差对应条件平均处理效应，开发集成因果路由器训练框架纠正偏差并处理数据源不平衡

Result: 数值实验表明该方法能提供更准确的路由，改善成本与质量之间的权衡

Conclusion: 基于因果推断的集成路由器训练框架能有效纠正偏好数据偏差，提升路由的鲁棒性和效率

Abstract: In language tasks that require extensive human--model interaction, deploying
a single "best" model for every query can be expensive. To reduce inference
cost while preserving the quality of the responses, a large language model
(LLM) router selects the most appropriate model from a pool of candidates for
each query. A central challenge to training a high-quality router is the
scarcity of reliable supervision. Gold-standard data (e.g., expert-verified
labels or rubric-based scores) provide accurate quality evaluations of LLM
responses but are costly and difficult to scale. In contrast, preference-based
data, collected via crowdsourcing or LLM-as-a-judge systems, are cheaper and
more scalable, yet often biased in reflecting the true quality of responses. We
cast the problem of LLM router training with combined gold-standard and
preference-based data into a causal inference framework by viewing the response
evaluation mechanism as the treatment assignment. This perspective further
reveals that the bias in preference-based data corresponds to the well-known
causal estimand: the conditional average treatment effect. Based on this new
perspective, we develop an integrative causal router training framework that
corrects preference-data bias, address imbalances between two data sources, and
improve routing robustness and efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate
that our approach delivers more accurate routing and improves the trade-off
between cost and quality.

Conclusion: 结合主动学习的优先级算法能有效防止生成式AI工作流浪费资源，显著提高高质量候选方案的识别能力。

Abstract: Generative AI poses both opportunities and risks for solving inverse design
problems in the sciences. Generative tools provide the ability to expand and
refine a search space autonomously, but do so at the cost of exploring
low-quality regions until sufficiently fine tuned. Here, we propose a queue
prioritization algorithm that combines generative modeling and active learning
in the context of a distributed workflow for exploring complex design spaces.
We find that incorporating an active learning model to prioritize top design
candidates can prevent a generative AI workflow from expending resources on
nonsensical candidates and halt potential generative model decay. For an
existing generative AI workflow for discovering novel molecular structure
candidates for carbon capture, our active learning approach significantly
increases the number of high-quality candidates identified by the generative
model. We find that, out of 1000 novel candidates, our workflow without active
learning can generate an average of 281 high-performing candidates, while our
proposed prioritization with active learning can generate an average 604
high-performing candidates.

Conclusion: FedIF为现实世界部署提供了一个实用、理论可靠且可扩展的联邦学习聚合方案，是Shapley值方法的有效替代。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) faces persistent robustness challenges due to non-IID
data distributions and adversarial client behavior. A promising mitigation
strategy is contribution evaluation, which enables adaptive aggregation by
quantifying each client's utility to the global model. However,
state-of-the-art Shapley-value-based approaches incur high computational
overhead due to repeated model reweighting and inference, which limits their
scalability. We propose FedIF, a novel FL aggregation framework that leverages
trajectory-based influence estimation to efficiently compute client
contributions. FedIF adapts decentralized FL by introducing normalized and
smoothed influence scores computed from lightweight gradient operations on
client updates and a public validation set. Theoretical analysis demonstrates
that FedIF yields a tighter bound on one-step global loss change under noisy
conditions. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST show that FedIF
achieves robustness comparable to or exceeding SV-based methods in the presence
of label noise, gradient noise, and adversarial samples, while reducing
aggregation overhead by up to 450x. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness
of FedIF's design choices, including local weight normalization and influence
smoothing. Our results establish FedIF as a practical, theoretically grounded,
and scalable alternative to Shapley-value-based approaches for efficient and
robust FL in real-world deployments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的上下文强化学习(ICRL)方法在适应过程中缺乏安全保障，无法在最大化奖励的同时控制成本，这限制了其在安全关键场景中的应用。

Method: 在约束马尔可夫决策过程框架下，通过扩展策略神经网络的输入上下文，使智能体在无参数更新的适应过程中同时优化奖励和成本函数，并能根据成本容忍度阈值主动调整行为。

Result: 智能体能够根据成本预算主动调整行为策略：预算较高时行为更激进，预算较低时行为更保守，实现了安全的在线适应。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了上下文强化学习中的安全适应，为ICRL在安全关键领域的应用提供了重要基础。

Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) is an emerging RL paradigm where the
agent, after some pretraining procedure, is able to adapt to
out-of-distribution test tasks without any parameter updates. The agent
achieves this by continually expanding the input (i.e., the context) to its
policy neural networks. For example, the input could be all the history
experience that the agent has access to until the current time step. The
agent's performance improves as the input grows, without any parameter updates.
In this work, we propose the first method that promotes the safety of ICRL's
adaptation process in the framework of constrained Markov Decision Processes.
In other words, during the parameter-update-free adaptation process, the agent
not only maximizes the reward but also minimizes an additional cost function.
We also demonstrate that our agent actively reacts to the threshold (i.e.,
budget) of the cost tolerance. With a higher cost budget, the agent behaves
more aggressively, and with a lower cost budget, the agent behaves more
conservatively.

Abstract: Black-box optimization (BBO) addresses problems where objectives are
accessible only through costly queries without gradients or explicit structure.
Classical derivative-free methods -- line search, direct search, and
model-based solvers such as Bayesian optimization -- form the backbone of BBO,
yet often struggle in high-dimensional, noisy, or mixed-integer settings.
  Recent advances use machine learning (ML) and reinforcement learning (RL) to
enhance BBO: ML provides expressive surrogates, adaptive updates, meta-learning
portfolios, and generative models, while RL enables dynamic operator
configuration, robustness, and meta-optimization across tasks.
  This paper surveys these developments, covering representative algorithms
such as NNs with the modular model-based optimization framework (mlrMBO),
zeroth-order adaptive momentum methods (ZO-AdaMM), automated BBO (ABBO),
distributed block-wise optimization (DiBB), partition-based Bayesian
optimization (SPBOpt), the transformer-based optimizer (B2Opt),
diffusion-model-based BBO, surrogate-assisted RL for differential evolution
(Surr-RLDE), robust BBO (RBO), coordinate-ascent model-based optimization with
relative entropy (CAS-MORE), log-barrier stochastic gradient descent (LB-SGD),
policy improvement with black-box (PIBB), and offline Q-learning with Mamba
backbones (Q-Mamba).
  We also review benchmark efforts such as the NeurIPS 2020 BBO Challenge and
the MetaBox framework. Overall, we highlight how ML and RL transform classical
inexact solvers into more scalable, robust, and adaptive frameworks for
real-world optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稀疏自编码器(SAE)的许多特征只有在高激活强度下才可解释，希望通过二值化消除连续激活变化带来的不可解释信息。

Method: 使用二进制稀疏自编码器和二进制转码器，将所有激活值约束为二进制(0或1)。

Result: 二值化显著提高了发现特征的可解释性和单义性，但增加了重构误差。同时产生了更多不可解释的超高频特征。

Conclusion: 多义性可能是神经网络激活的固有特性，二值化虽然改善了可解释性，但频率调整后的评分显示连续稀疏编码器表现略优。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to decompose neural network activations
into sparsely activating features, but many SAE features are only interpretable
at high activation strengths. To address this issue we propose to use binary
sparse autoencoders (BAEs) and binary transcoders (BTCs), which constrain all
activations to be zero or one. We find that binarisation significantly improves
the interpretability and monosemanticity of the discovered features, while
increasing reconstruction error. By eliminating the distinction between high
and low activation strengths, we prevent uninterpretable information from being
smuggled in through the continuous variation in feature activations. However,
we also find that binarisation increases the number of uninterpretable
ultra-high frequency features, and when interpretability scores are
frequency-adjusted, the scores for continuous sparse coders are slightly better
than those of binary ones. This suggests that polysemanticity may be an
ineliminable property of neural activations.

Result: 在MLPs、CNNs、Transformers/LLMs和KAN上的实验表明，使用EMP剪枝的稀疏模型性能与原始密集网络相当。默认β=1提供稳健阈值，β≠1可调整稀疏度。

Conclusion: EMP提供了一种通用、自适应的剪枝阈值确定方法，适用于各种评分标准和模型架构，无需手动调参即可获得良好性能。

Abstract: We introduce Effective Model Pruning (EMP), a context-agnostic,
parameter-free rule addressing a fundamental question about pruning: how many
entries to keep. EMP does not prescribe how to score the parameters or prune
the models; instead, it supplies a universal adaptive threshold that can be
applied to any pruning criterion: weight magnitude, attention score, KAN
importance score, or even feature-level signals such as image pixel, and used
on structural parts or weights of the models. Given any score vector s, EMP
maps s to a built-in effective number N_eff which is inspired by the Inverse
Simpson index of contributors. Retaining the N_eff highest scoring entries and
zeroing the remainder yields sparse models with performance comparable to the
original dense networks across MLPs, CNNs, Transformers/LLMs, and KAN, in our
experiments. By leveraging the geometry of the simplex, we derive a tight lower
bound on the preserved mass s_eff (the sum of retained scores) over the
corresponding ordered probability simplex associated with the score vector s.
We further verify the effectiveness of N_eff by pruning the model with a scaled
threshold \b{eta}*N_eff across a variety of criteria and models. Experiments
suggest that the default \b{eta} = 1 yields a robust threshold for model
pruning while \b{eta} not equal to 1 still serves as an optional adjustment to
meet specific sparsity requirements.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: T-BiGAN是一个集成窗口注意力Transformer和双向生成对抗网络的新框架，用于无监督实时检测同步相量数据中的异常，在硬件在环PMU基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保电网韧性需要及时无监督地检测同步相量数据流中的异常，传统方法依赖人工标注的故障数据，难以适应实时监控需求。

Method: 采用自注意力编码器-解码器架构捕捉电网复杂时空依赖关系，结合联合判别器强制循环一致性，使用自适应评分结合重构误差、潜在空间漂移和判别器置信度进行实时异常标记。

Result: 在真实硬件在环PMU基准测试中，T-BiGAN达到ROC-AUC 0.95和平均精度0.996，显著优于领先的有监督和无监督方法，特别擅长检测细微频率和电压偏差。

Conclusion: T-BiGAN展示了在不依赖人工标注故障数据的情况下，实现实时广域监控的实际价值，为电网异常检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring power grid resilience requires the timely and unsupervised detection
of anomalies in synchrophasor data streams. We introduce T-BiGAN, a novel
framework that integrates window-attention Transformers within a bidirectional
Generative Adversarial Network (BiGAN) to address this challenge. Its
self-attention encoder-decoder architecture captures complex spatio-temporal
dependencies across the grid, while a joint discriminator enforces cycle
consistency to align the learned latent space with the true data distribution.
Anomalies are flagged in real-time using an adaptive score that combines
reconstruction error, latent space drift, and discriminator confidence.
Evaluated on a realistic hardware-in-the-loop PMU benchmark, T-BiGAN achieves
an ROC-AUC of 0.95 and an average precision of 0.996, significantly
outperforming leading supervised and unsupervised methods. It shows particular
strength in detecting subtle frequency and voltage deviations, demonstrating
its practical value for live, wide-area monitoring without relying on manually
labeled fault data.

*Zhendong Mi,Bian Sun,Grace Li Zhang,Shaoyi Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出D-Rank框架，通过层间动态秩分配来优化LLM的SVD压缩，相比均匀压缩方法在相同压缩比下获得更低的困惑度和更高的推理精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SVD压缩方法对所有层使用统一压缩比，忽略了LLM中不同层的信息密度差异（中间层信息更丰富，首尾层更冗余），导致压缩效率不高。

Method: 1) 使用有效秩作为信息密度度量指标；2) 基于拉格朗日乘子的优化方案动态分配秩；3) 对注意力层进行秩重平衡；4) 扩展到分组查询注意力的最新LLM。

Result: 在多个LLM和压缩比下，D-Rank始终优于SVD-LLM、ASVD和Basis Sharing：LLaMA-3-8B在20%压缩比时困惑度降低15%以上，LLaMA-7B在40%压缩比时零样本推理准确率提升5%，同时吞吐量更高。

Conclusion: D-Rank通过考虑层间信息密度差异的动态秩分配，显著提升了SVD压缩LLM的效果，在保持高压缩比的同时维持了模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly scaled in size, bringing severe
memory and computational challenges that hinder their deployment. Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD)-based compression has emerged as an appealing
post-training compression technique for LLMs, yet most existing methods apply a
uniform compression ratio across all layers, implicitly assuming homogeneous
information included in various layers. This overlooks the substantial
intra-layer heterogeneity observed in LLMs, where middle layers tend to encode
richer information while early and late layers are more redundant. In this
work, we revisit the existing SVD-based compression method and propose D-Rank,
a framework with layer-wise balanced Dynamic Rank allocation for LLMs
compression. We first introduce effective rank as a principled metric to
measure the information density of weight matrices, and then allocate ranks via
a Lagrange multiplier-based optimization scheme to adaptively assign more
capacity to groups with higher information density under a fixed compression
ratio. Moreover, we rebalance the allocated ranks across attention layers to
account for their varying importance and extend D-Rank to latest LLMs with
grouped-query attention. Extensive experiments on various LLMs with different
scales across multiple compression ratios demonstrate that D-Rank consistently
outperforms SVD-LLM, ASVD, and Basis Sharing, achieving more than 15 lower
perplexity with LLaMA-3-8B model on C4 datasets at 20% compression ratio and up
to 5% higher zero-shot reasoning accuracy with LLaMA-7B model at 40%
compression ratio while achieving even higher throughput.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Swift是一种单步一致性模型，首次实现了基于连续排名概率得分（CRPS）的概率流模型自回归微调，无需多模型集成或参数扰动，在S2S天气预报中比最先进的扩散模型快39倍，且预报技能与基于数值的IFS ENS相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型为概率天气预报提供了物理基础框架，但其在推理时依赖缓慢的迭代求解器，使得在次季节到季节（S2S）应用中不实用，因为S2S需要长预报时效和领域驱动的校准。

Method: 引入Swift单步一致性模型，首次实现基于CRPS目标的概率流模型自回归微调，消除了对多模型集成或参数扰动的需求。

Result: Swift产生熟练的6小时预报，可稳定运行长达75天，比最先进的扩散基线快39倍，同时实现与基于数值的IFS ENS相当的预报技能。

Conclusion: 这标志着从中期到季节尺度的高效可靠集合预报迈出了一步。

Abstract: Diffusion models offer a physically grounded framework for probabilistic
weather forecasting, but their typical reliance on slow, iterative solvers
during inference makes them impractical for subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S)
applications where long lead-times and domain-driven calibration are essential.
To address this, we introduce Swift, a single-step consistency model that, for
the first time, enables autoregressive finetuning of a probability flow model
with a continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) objective. This eliminates
the need for multi-model ensembling or parameter perturbations. Results show
that Swift produces skillful 6-hourly forecasts that remain stable for up to 75
days, running $39\times$ faster than state-of-the-art diffusion baselines while
achieving forecast skill competitive with the numerical-based, operational IFS
ENS. This marks a step toward efficient and reliable ensemble forecasting from
medium-range to seasonal-scales.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预条件处理在机器学习中广泛用于加速经验风险的收敛，但其对期望风险的影响尚未充分探索。本文旨在研究预条件处理如何影响特征学习和泛化性能。

Method: 将预条件器实例化为输入协方差矩阵的p次幂，在单索引教师模型框架下，分析指数p和教师与输入谱对齐对泛化的影响，并从噪声鲁棒性、分布外泛化和前向知识迁移三个角度研究特征学习。

Result: 研究发现学习到的特征表示紧密反映了预条件器引入的谱偏置——偏向被强调的组件，对被抑制的组件敏感性降低。当谱偏置与教师模型对齐时，泛化性能显著增强。

Conclusion: 预条件处理通过控制谱偏置影响特征学习，当预条件器的谱偏置与目标任务的谱结构对齐时，能够显著提升模型的泛化性能、噪声鲁棒性和知识迁移能力。

Abstract: Preconditioning is widely used in machine learning to accelerate convergence
on the empirical risk, yet its role on the expected risk remains underexplored.
In this work, we investigate how preconditioning affects feature learning and
generalization performance. We first show that the input information available
to the model is conveyed solely through the Gram matrix defined by the
preconditioner's metric, thereby inducing a controllable spectral bias on
feature learning. Concretely, instantiating the preconditioner as the $p$-th
power of the input covariance matrix and within a single-index teacher model,
we prove that in generalization, the exponent $p$ and the alignment between the
teacher and the input spectrum are crucial factors. We further investigate how
the interplay between these factors influences feature learning from three
complementary perspectives: (i) Robustness to noise, (ii) Out-of-distribution
generalization, and (iii) Forward knowledge transfer. Our results indicate that
the learned feature representations closely mirror the spectral bias introduced
by the preconditioner -- favoring components that are emphasized and exhibiting
reduced sensitivity to those that are suppressed. Crucially, we demonstrate
that generalization is significantly enhanced when this spectral bias is
aligned with that of the teacher.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确定性神经网络验证中的分支定界与预激活分裂方法已被证明非常有效，本文旨在将该框架扩展到概率验证场景。

Method: 提出BaB-prob方法，通过分裂预激活将原问题迭代划分为子问题，利用线性边界传播计算每个子问题的概率边界，引入不确定性水平概念并设计两种高效预激活分裂策略。

Result: 在未训练网络、MNIST和CIFAR-10模型以及VNN-COMP 2025基准测试中，该方法在中等至高维输入问题上始终优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: BaB-prob方法成功将分支定界框架扩展到概率验证，证明了其正确性和完备性，并在各种设置下表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Branch-and-bound with preactivation splitting has been shown highly effective
for deterministic verification of neural networks. In this paper, we extend
this framework to the probabilistic setting. We propose BaB-prob that
iteratively divides the original problem into subproblems by splitting
preactivations and leverages linear bounds computed by linear bound propagation
to bound the probability for each subproblem. We prove soundness and
completeness of BaB-prob for feedforward-ReLU neural networks. Furthermore, we
introduce the notion of uncertainty level and design two efficient strategies
for preactivation splitting, yielding BaB-prob-ordered and BaB+BaBSR-prob. We
evaluate BaB-prob on untrained networks, MNIST and CIFAR-10 models,
respectively, and VNN-COMP 2025 benchmarks. Across these settings, our approach
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in medium- to
high-dimensional input problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PWMPR是一种从稀疏到稠密的训练方法，通过路径权重乘积引导的随机增长自动发现网络的最佳密度，相比传统剪枝方法显著降低了训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏网络训练方法（迭代剪枝、动态稀疏训练、初始化剪枝）要么需要大量重训练成本，要么需要预先固定目标密度。PWMPR旨在通过增长而非剪枝的方式，自动发现网络的最佳运行密度。

Method: PWMPR从稀疏种子开始，基于路径核启发式评分添加边，通过随机化缓解瓶颈，并使用逻辑拟合规则检测准确率平台期来停止增长。

Result: 在CIFAR、TinyImageNet和ImageNet上的实验表明，PWMPR能够接近IMP获得的彩票券性能（虽然密度更高），但训练成本显著降低（约1.5倍稠密训练成本 vs IMP的3-4倍）。

Conclusion: 基于增长的密度发现是一个有前景的范式，与剪枝和动态稀疏方法形成互补。

Abstract: The lottery ticket hypothesis suggests that dense networks contain sparse
subnetworks that can be trained in isolation to match full-model performance.
Existing approaches-iterative pruning, dynamic sparse training, and pruning at
initialization-either incur heavy retraining costs or assume the target density
is fixed in advance. We introduce Path Weight Magnitude Product-biased Random
growth (PWMPR), a constructive sparse-to-dense training paradigm that grows
networks rather than pruning them, while automatically discovering their
operating density. Starting from a sparse seed, PWMPR adds edges guided by
path-kernel-inspired scores, mitigates bottlenecks via randomization, and stops
when a logistic-fit rule detects plateauing accuracy. Experiments on CIFAR,
TinyImageNet, and ImageNet show that PWMPR approaches the performance of
IMP-derived lottery tickets-though at higher density-at substantially lower
cost (~1.5x dense vs. 3-4x for IMP). These results establish growth-based
density discovery as a promising paradigm that complements pruning and dynamic
sparsity.

TL;DR: NuRL是一种通过自生成提示来提升LLM推理上限的新方法，解决了现有RL算法无法从模型"无法解决"的问题中学习的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在线强化学习算法如GRPO无法从模型"无法解决"的问题中学习，导致模型的上限无法提升。这些困难样本无法产生训练信号，因为没有rollout能获得奖励。

Method: NuRL通过自生成提示来降低问题难度。对于通过率为0%的困难样本，注入模型自己生成的提示，然后重新生成轨迹批次。提示包含解决问题的核心知识，是抽象且高层次的。

Result: NuRL在6个基准测试和3个模型上实现了一致的改进，能够提升模型的上限，而GRPO无法改变基础模型的pass@1024。提示最有效时是抽象且高层次的，在GRPO收敛后必要地应用。

Conclusion: NuRL通过自生成提示解锁了从困难样本中学习的能力，能够提升LLM推理的上限，且与测试时扩展方法互补。

Abstract: Current online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms like GRPO share a key
limitation in LLM reasoning: they cannot learn from problems that are
"unsolvable" to the model. In other words, they can only improve performance on
problems where the model is capable of exploring the correct answer.
Consequently, the model's "upper limit" remains unchanged after RL training,
even though the likelihood of solving easier, solvable problems may increase.
These hard samples cannot contribute to training, as no rollouts yield rewards
and thus no gradients are produced. To unlock learning from these hard samples,
we propose NuRL, a "nudging" method that aims to push the upper bound of LLM
reasoning using self-generated hints, i.e., abstract cues that help reduce the
problem difficulty for the model. Given a question and its gold answer, the
model generates a CoT and then produces a hint containing the core knowledge
needed to solve the problem. During training, we generate G rollouts from the
base policy and use the pass rate to decide whether the hint should be
injected. For hard samples with a 0% pass rate, we inject the hint and
regenerate a new batch of trajectories. This yields two benefits: (1) the hint
boosts pass rates (from 0% to non-zero), thereby introducing training signals
for previously unsolvable samples, and (2) the hints are self-generated,
avoiding distributional shift and do not rely on external models. NuRL achieves
consistent improvements across 6 benchmarks and 3 models, while remaining
complementary to test-time scaling. Notably, NuRL can raise the model's upper
limit, whereas GRPO leaves pass@1024 unchanged from the base model.
Furthermore, we present a systematic study of what makes an effective hint and
when hints are most useful. Interestingly, the best hints are abstract and
high-level, and are most beneficial when applied necessarily and after GRPO has
converged.

<details>

Motivation: 传统MoE架构的路由机制忽略了模态间信息丰富且随时间变化的交互动态，这限制了专家专业化，因为模型无法显式利用内在模态关系进行有效推理。

Method: 提出了一个多模态交互感知路由器，基于token的交互性质将其分配到专家；构建了时间多模态交互动态的新公式化表达，用于指导专家路由；动态路由鼓励专家获得可泛化的交互处理技能而非仅学习任务特定特征。

Result: 在具有挑战性的多模态基准测试上的综合实验验证了该方法，展示了性能提升和改进的可解释性；时间多模态交互在不同应用中揭示了有意义的模式。

Conclusion: 该框架通过利用时间多模态交互动态，改进了基于MoE模型的设计和性能，实现了增强的性能和更好的可解释性。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have become pivotal for large-scale
multimodal models. However, their routing mechanisms typically overlook the
informative, time-varying interaction dynamics between modalities. This
limitation hinders expert specialization, as the model cannot explicitly
leverage intrinsic modality relationships for effective reasoning. To address
this, we propose a novel framework that guides MoE routing using quantified
temporal interaction. A multimodal interaction-aware router learns to dispatch
tokens to experts based on the nature of their interactions. This dynamic
routing encourages experts to acquire generalizable interaction-processing
skills rather than merely learning task-specific features. Our framework builds
on a new formulation of temporal multimodal interaction dynamics, which are
used to guide expert routing. We first demonstrate that these temporal
multimodal interactions reveal meaningful patterns across applications, and
then show how they can be leveraged to improve both the design and performance
of MoE-based models. Comprehensive experiments on challenging multimodal
benchmarks validate our approach, demonstrating both enhanced performance and
improved interpretability.

Conclusion: 该方法在最小输入级解释和模型内部计算机制理解之间建立了实用桥梁，为解释预训练分类器的决策提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Machine learning models, by virtue of training, learn a large repertoire of
decision rules for any given input, and any one of these may suffice to justify
a prediction. However, in high-dimensional input spaces, such rules are
difficult to identify and interpret. In this paper, we introduce an
activation-matching based approach to generate minimal and faithful
explanations for the decisions of pre-trained image classifiers. We aim to
identify minimal explanations that not only preserve the model's decision but
are also concise and human-readable. To achieve this, we train a lightweight
autoencoder to produce binary masks that learns to highlight the decision-wise
critical regions of an image while discarding irrelevant background. The
training objective integrates activation alignment across multiple layers,
consistency at the output label, priors that encourage sparsity, and
compactness, along with a robustness constraint that enforces faithfulness. The
minimal explanations so generated also lead us to mechanistically interpreting
the model internals. In this regard we also introduce a circuit readout
procedure wherein using the explanation's forward pass and gradients, we
identify active channels and construct a channel-level graph, scoring
inter-layer edges by ingress weight magnitude times source activation and
feature-to-class links by classifier weight magnitude times feature activation.
Together, these contributions provide a practical bridge between minimal
input-level explanations and a mechanistic understanding of the internal
computations driving model decisions.

Motivation: 传统字典学习方法主要关注单个样本的表示稀疏性，忽略了原子在样本间的共享模式，导致字典冗余和次优。需要一种能促进跨样本原子共享稀疏性的方法。

Method: 引入基于系数矩阵行向L∞范数的正则化项，结合Beta-Bernoulli先验的概率模型推导，提供贝叶斯解释并建立超参数选择理论。

Conclusion: 提出的正则化方法有效解决了字典冗余问题，通过理论分析和实验验证了其在提升重建质量和稀疏性方面的优势。

Abstract: Dictionary learning is traditionally formulated as an $L_1$-regularized
signal reconstruction problem. While recent developments have incorporated
discriminative, hierarchical, or generative structures, most approaches rely on
encouraging representation sparsity over individual samples that overlook how
atoms are shared across samples, resulting in redundant and sub-optimal
dictionaries. We introduce a parsimony promoting regularizer based on the
row-wise $L_\infty$ norm of the coefficient matrix. This additional penalty
encourages entire rows of the coefficient matrix to vanish, thereby reducing
the number of dictionary atoms activated across the dataset. We derive the
formulation from a probabilistic model with Beta-Bernoulli priors, which
provides a Bayesian interpretation linking the regularization parameters to
prior distributions. We further establish theoretical calculation for optimal
hyperparameter selection and connect our formulation to both Minimum
Description Length, Bayesian model selection and pathlet learning. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
substantially improved reconstruction quality (with a 20\% reduction in RMSE)
and enhanced representation sparsity, utilizing fewer than one-tenth of the
available dictionary atoms, while empirically validating our theoretical
analysis.

Abstract: Active Test-Time Adaptation (ATTA) improves model robustness under domain
shift by selectively querying human annotations at deployment, but existing
methods use heuristic uncertainty measures and suffer from low data selection
efficiency, wasting human annotation budget. We propose Conformal Prediction
Active TTA (CPATTA), which first brings principled, coverage-guaranteed

a domain-shift detector that adapts human supervision, and a staged update
scheme balances human-labeled and model-labeled data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CPATTA consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ATTA

Motivation: 时间序列问答任务面临标注数据缺乏的挑战，而视觉语言模型在零样本分析时间序列信号方面显示出潜力。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型生成伪标签来训练TSQA模型，依赖深度神经网络对噪声标签的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果表明，TSQA模型不仅能用伪标签成功训练，还能通过利用大量未标注数据超越VLM本身的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了TSQA任务中标注数据不足的问题，证明了伪标签训练策略的可行性。

Abstract: Time-series question answering (TSQA) tasks face significant challenges due
to the lack of labeled data. Alternatively, with recent advancements in
large-scale models, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated the
potential to analyze time-series signals in a zero-shot manner. In this paper,
we propose a training approach that uses pseudo labels generated by a VLM.
Although VLMs can produce incorrect labels, TSQA models can still be
effectively trained based on the property that deep neural networks are
inherently robust to such noisy labels. Our experimental results demonstrate
that TSQA models are not only successfully trained with pseudo labels, but also
surpass the performance of the VLM itself by leveraging a large amount of

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理信息的学习框架，使用仅5个IMU的惯性测量数据来预测人体运动，通过整合领域知识到训练和推理过程中，实现高精度且物理可行的人体运动预测。


<details>

Conclusion: 该物理信息学习框架能够仅使用5个IMU实现准确、物理可行的人体运动预测，解决了传统方法在现实场景中的局限性。

Abstract: Accurate and physically feasible human motion prediction is crucial for safe
and seamless human-robot collaboration. While recent advancements in human
motion capture enable real-time pose estimation, the practical value of many
existing approaches is limited by the lack of future predictions and
consideration of physical constraints. Conventional motion prediction schemes
rely heavily on past poses, which are not always available in real-world
scenarios. To address these limitations, we present a physics-informed learning
framework that integrates domain knowledge into both training and inference to
predict human motion using inertial measurements from only 5 IMUs. We propose a
network that accounts for the spatial characteristics of human movements.
During training, we incorporate forward and differential kinematics functions
as additional loss components to regularize the learned joint predictions. At
the inference stage, we refine the prediction from the previous iteration to
update a joint state buffer, which is used as extra inputs to the network.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high accuracy,
smooth transitions between motions, and generalizes well to unseen subjects

TL;DR: 提出一种自适应图粗化方法，在训练过程中联合学习图神经网络参数并通过K-means聚类合并节点，以处理大规模图数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着现实世界图的规模不断增大，直接处理变得越来越困难甚至不可行。为大规模数据定制算法可能牺牲性能，因此考虑通过图缩减来减少训练期间使用的数据量。

Method: 同时训练图神经网络并通过基于节点嵌入的K-means聚类对图进行粗化，在训练过程中动态合并节点，而不是作为预处理步骤。

Result: 在同类性和异类性节点分类数据集上验证了方法的有效性，可视化显示粗化图在训练过程中能够适应学习任务。

Conclusion: 该方法能够处理其他方法难以应对的场景（如异类性数据），并且节点聚类能够根据学习任务自适应调整，而不是仅依赖图连接性和特征。

Abstract: We propose an adaptive graph coarsening method to jointly learn graph neural
network (GNN) parameters and merge nodes via K-means clustering during
training. As real-world graphs grow larger, processing them directly becomes
increasingly challenging and sometimes infeasible. Tailoring algorithms to
large-scale data may sacrifice performance, so we instead consider graph
reduction to decrease the amount of data used during training. In particular,
we propose a method to simultaneously train a GNN and coarsen its graph by
partitioning nodes via K-means clustering based on their embeddings. Unlike
past graph coarsening works, our approach allows us to merge nodes during
training. Not only does this preclude coarsening as a preprocessing step, but
our node clusters can adapt to the learning task instead of relying solely on
graph connectivity and features. Thus, our method is amenable to scenarios that
are challenging for other methods, such as heterophilic data. We validate our
approach on both homophilic and heterophilic node classification datasets. We
further visualize relationships between node embeddings and their corresponding
clusters to illustrate that our coarsened graph adapts to the learning task
during training.

*Dengming Zhang,Xiaowen Ma,Zhenliang Ni,Zhenkai Wu,Han Shu,Xin Jiang,Xinghao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Expert Merging和Expert Merging++两种模型合并方法，通过层间系数学习和重要性引导分块，在无标签数据上实现多专家模型的参数高效合并，在LLM和MLLM上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型合并方法存在局限性：免训练方法依赖手动调参，训练方法主要对齐参数而非下游任务行为，且通常忽略层间异质性。需要一种标签无关、参数高效且可扩展的多专家模型合并方法。

Method: Expert Merging使用少量未标记校准数据学习层间系数，通过隐藏状态和对数对齐优化，加入系数正则化和任务加权损失。Expert Merging++进一步引入重要性引导分块，基于学习系数、任务向量大小和参数数量分配分块系数，对高重要性层分配更多系数。

Result: 在InternVL、Qwen2-VL等MLLM骨干和Mistral LLM骨干上，该方法超越了强基准方法，Expert Merging++在某些情况下甚至超过了监督混合训练的性能。

Conclusion: Expert Merging系列方法提供了一种标签无关、参数高效且可扩展的多专家模型合并方案，能够有效处理层间异质性，在LLM和MLLM上取得了优越性能。

Abstract: Model merging, which combines multiple domain-specialized experts into a
single model, offers a practical path to endow Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with broad capabilities without the
cost of joint training or serving many models. However, training-free methods
rely on hand-tuned coefficients, whereas training-based methods primarily align
parameters rather than downstream task behavior and typically treat all layers
uniformly, ignoring inter-layer heterogeneity. We introduce Expert Merging, a
training-light method that learns a small set of layer-wise coefficients using
only unlabeled calibration data. The coefficients are optimized to explicitly
align the merged model's hidden states and logits with those of the
corresponding experts, with a coefficient regularizer for stability and
task-weighted losses for controllable trade-offs. To capture inter-layer
variation, Expert Merging++ augments this design with importance-guided
chunking: a normalized layer-importance metric, derived from learned
coefficients, task-vector magnitudes, and parameter counts, allocates more
chunk-wise coefficients to high-importance layers while keeping low-importance
layers lightweight. The result is a label-free, parameter-efficient, and
scalable approach to multi-expert model merging across LLMs and MLLMs. Across
MLLM backbones (InternVL and Qwen2-VL) and the LLM backbone (Mistral), our
method surpasses strong training-free and training-based merging baselines,
with Expert Merging++ delivering further gains and, in some cases, even
exceeding supervised Mixture Training. The source code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了UOT-RFM框架，通过无标签的逆重加权策略解决流匹配在长尾分布中的多数类偏见问题，提升少数类生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准流匹配在处理长尾分布时存在多数类偏见，导致少数类模式生成质量低且无法匹配真实类别比例。

Method: 使用小批量不平衡最优传输构建条件向量场，通过基于密度比的无标签多数分数进行逆重加权。

Result: 在长尾基准测试中优于现有流匹配基线，在平衡数据集上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: UOT-RFM能有效缓解多数类偏见，无需类别标签即可改善长尾分布下的生成质量。

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful framework for
continuous-time generative modeling. However, when applied to long-tailed
distributions, standard flow matching suffers from majority bias, producing
minority modes with low fidelity and failing to match the true class
proportions. In this work, we propose Unbalanced Optimal Transport Reweighted
Flow Matching (UOT-RFM), a novel framework for generative modeling under
class-imbalanced (long-tailed) distributions that operates without any class
label information. Our method constructs the conditional vector field using
mini-batch Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) and mitigates majority bias
through a principled inverse reweighting strategy. The reweighting relies on a
label-free majority score, defined as the density ratio between the target
distribution and the UOT marginal. This score quantifies the degree of majority
based on the geometric structure of the data, without requiring class labels.
By incorporating this score into the training objective, UOT-RFM theoretically
recovers the target distribution with first-order correction ($k=1$) and
empirically improves tail-class generation through higher-order corrections ($k
> 1$). Our model outperforms existing flow matching baselines on long-tailed
benchmarks, while maintaining competitive performance on balanced datasets.

Motivation: 传统声明验证方法忽略证据间的复杂交互，导致验证结果不可靠。完全连接图方法面临数据噪声和数据偏见两大挑战。

Method: MuPlon框架集成后门路径和前门路径的双因果干预策略：后门路径优化节点概率权重稀释噪声干扰，前门路径提取相关子图构建推理路径并应用反事实推理消除偏见。

Result: 实验结果表明MuPlon优于现有方法，达到最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: MuPlon通过因果干预有效解决了声明验证中的数据噪声和偏见问题，提升了验证的可靠性。

Abstract: As a critical task in data quality control, claim verification aims to curb
the spread of misinformation by assessing the truthfulness of claims based on a
wide range of evidence. However, traditional methods often overlook the complex
interactions between evidence, leading to unreliable verification results. A
straightforward solution represents the claim and evidence as a fully connected
graph, which we define as the Claim-Evidence Graph (C-E Graph). Nevertheless,
claim verification methods based on fully connected graphs face two primary
confounding challenges, Data Noise and Data Biases. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Path Causal Optimization
(MuPlon). MuPlon integrates a dual causal intervention strategy, consisting of
the back-door path and front-door path. In the back-door path, MuPlon dilutes
noisy node interference by optimizing node probability weights, while
simultaneously strengthening the connections between relevant evidence nodes.
In the front-door path, MuPlon extracts highly relevant subgraphs and
constructs reasoning paths, further applying counterfactual reasoning to
eliminate data biases within these paths. The experimental results demonstrate
that MuPlon outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

antenna patterns. MC-CLE also achieves lower cross-entropy loss relative to a
uniform baseline and Gaussian posteriors. alternatives under a uniform-loss

TL;DR: B2R框架通过非对称条件处理解决了离线安全强化学习中成本到目标（CTG）和回报到目标（RTG）的对称输入问题，将CTG重新定义为固定安全预算下的边界约束，在38个安全关键任务中35个满足安全约束且获得更好的奖励性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于序列模型的方法对RTG和CTG使用对称输入标记，忽略了它们的内在不对称性：RTG是灵活的性能目标，而CTG应该是刚性的安全边界，这导致不可靠的约束满足。

Method: 提出B2R框架，通过成本信号重新对齐实现非对称条件处理，将CTG重新定义为固定安全预算下的边界约束，统一所有可行轨迹的成本分布，同时结合旋转位置嵌入增强安全区域内的探索。

Result: 在38个安全关键任务中，B2R在35个任务中满足安全约束，并且在奖励性能上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了对称标记条件的局限性，并为将序列模型应用于安全RL建立了新的理论和实践方法。

Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning aims to learn policies that satisfy
predefined safety constraints from static datasets. Existing
sequence-model-based methods condition action generation on symmetric input
tokens for return-to-go and cost-to-go, neglecting their intrinsic asymmetry:
return-to-go (RTG) serves as a flexible performance target, while cost-to-go
(CTG) should represent a rigid safety boundary. This symmetric conditioning
leads to unreliable constraint satisfaction, especially when encountering
out-of-distribution cost trajectories. To address this, we propose
Boundary-to-Region (B2R), a framework that enables asymmetric conditioning
through cost signal realignment . B2R redefines CTG as a boundary constraint
under a fixed safety budget, unifying the cost distribution of all feasible
trajectories while preserving reward structures. Combined with rotary
positional embeddings , it enhances exploration within the safe region.
Experimental results show that B2R satisfies safety constraints in 35 out of 38
safety-critical tasks while achieving superior reward performance over baseline
methods. This work highlights the limitations of symmetric token conditioning
and establishes a new theoretical and practical approach for applying sequence
models to safe RL. Our code is available at https://github.com/HuikangSu/B2R.

Abstract: Ship traffic is an increasing source of underwater radiated noise in coastal
waters, motivating real-time digital twins of ocean acoustics for operational
noise mitigation. We present a physics-guided probabilistic framework to
predict three-dimensional transmission loss in realistic ocean environments. As
a case study, we consider the Salish Sea along shipping routes from the Pacific
Ocean to the Port of Vancouver. A dataset of over 30 million source-receiver
pairs was generated with a Gaussian beam solver across seasonal sound speed
profiles and one-third-octave frequency bands spanning 12.5 Hz to 8 kHz. We
first assess sparse variational Gaussian processes (SVGP) and then incorporate
physics-based mean functions combining spherical spreading with
frequency-dependent absorption. To capture nonlinear effects, we examine deep
sigma-point processes and stochastic variational deep kernel learning. The
final framework integrates four components: (i) a learnable physics-informed
mean that represents dominant propagation trends, (ii) a convolutional encoder
for bathymetry along the source-receiver track, (iii) a neural encoder for
source, receiver, and frequency coordinates, and (iv) a residual SVGP layer
that provides calibrated predictive uncertainty. This probabilistic digital
twin facilitates the construction of sound-exposure bounds and worst-case
scenarios for received levels. We further demonstrate the application of the
framework to ship speed optimization, where predicted transmission loss
combined with near-field source models provides sound exposure level estimates
for minimizing acoustic impacts on marine mammals. The proposed framework
advances uncertainty-aware digital twins for ocean acoustics and illustrates
how physics-guided machine learning can support sustainable maritime
operations.

Conclusion: 证明了简单原则的有效性：通过聚合节点特征噪声与结构特征来改进图对比学习，为异质图表示学习提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has shown strong promise for unsupervised
graph representation learning, yet its effectiveness on heterophilic graphs,
where connected nodes often belong to different classes, remains limited. Most
existing methods rely on complex augmentation schemes, intricate encoders, or
negative sampling, which raises the question of whether such complexity is
truly necessary in this challenging setting. In this work, we revisit the
foundations of supervised and unsupervised learning on graphs and uncover a
simple yet effective principle for GCL: mitigating node feature noise by
aggregating it with structural features derived from the graph topology. This
observation suggests that the original node features and the graph structure
naturally provide two complementary views for contrastive learning. Building on
this insight, we propose an embarrassingly simple GCL model that uses a GCN
encoder to capture structural features and an MLP encoder to isolate node
feature noise. Our design requires neither data augmentation nor negative
sampling, yet achieves state-of-the-art results on heterophilic benchmarks with
minimal computational and memory overhead, while also offering advantages in
homophilic graphs in terms of complexity, scalability, and robustness. We
provide theoretical justification for our approach and validate its
effectiveness through extensive experiments, including robustness evaluations
against both black-box and white-box adversarial attacks.

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法无需保留数据集即可达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RCU方法有效解决了连续遗忘过程中的累积灾难性效用损失问题，为机器遗忘提供了一种新的解决方案。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, their security
vulnerabilities have already drawn attention. Machine unlearning is introduced
to seek to mitigate these risks by removing the influence of undesirable data.
However, existing methods not only rely on the retained dataset to preserve
model utility, but also suffer from cumulative catastrophic utility loss under
continuous unlearning requests. To solve this dilemma, we propose a novel
method, called Rotation Control Unlearning (RCU), which leverages the
rotational salience weight of RCU to quantify and control the unlearning degree
in the continuous unlearning process. The skew symmetric loss is designed to
construct the existence of the cognitive rotation space, where the changes of
rotational angle can simulate the continuous unlearning process. Furthermore,
we design an orthogonal rotation axes regularization to enforce mutually
perpendicular rotation directions for continuous unlearning requests,
effectively minimizing interference and addressing cumulative catastrophic
utility loss. Experiments on multiple datasets confirm that our method without
retained dataset achieves SOTA performance.

TL;DR: OPPO是一个轻量级、模型无关的PPO-based RLHF框架，通过流水线重叠执行提高训练效率，加速1.8-2.8倍，GPU利用率提升1.4-2.1倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PPO-based RLHF训练管道存在效率低下问题，主要由于顺序多模型依赖和长尾响应长度导致阶段完成延迟。

Method: 引入两种新技术：1) 步骤内重叠，将上游模型输出流式传输，使下游模型可以提前预填充；2) 步骤间重叠，自适应地过度提交少量提示并将长生成推迟到后续步骤。

Result: OPPO显著加速了PPO-based RLHF训练，速度提升1.8-2.8倍，GPU利用率提高1.4-2.1倍，且不影响训练收敛。

Conclusion: OPPO是一个高效、易于集成的RLHF框架，仅需少量代码修改即可显著提升训练效率。

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) is a widely adopted paradigm for aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. However, its training pipeline suffers from
substantial inefficiencies due to sequential multi-model dependencies (e.g.,
reward model depends on actor outputs) and long-tail response lengths, where a
few long responses straggle the stage completion. We present OPPO, a novel,
lightweight, and model-agnostic PPO-based RLHF framework that improves training
efficiency by overlapping pipeline execution. OPPO introduces two novel
techniques: (1) Intra-step overlap, which streams upstream model outputs (e.g.,
actor model) in right-sized chunks, enabling the downstream model (e.g.,
reward) to begin prefill while the upstream continues decoding; and (2)
Inter-step overlap, which adaptively overcommits a few prompts and defers long
generations to future steps, mitigating tail latency without discarding partial
work. OPPO integrates easily with existing PPO implementations with a few lines
of code change. Extensive evaluations show that OPPO accelerates PPO-based RLHF
training by $1.8 \times-2.8 \times$ and improves GPU utilization by $1.4
\times-2.1 \times$ without compromising training convergence.

Motivation: 现有聚类方法假设实体被动服从分组，但现实中实体具有局部自主性，会以特征表示无法完全捕捉的方式覆盖预设关联，从而显著改变聚类结果。

Method: 结合强化学习与确定性退火过程，使用自适应距离估计网络学习实体与聚类代表之间的依赖关系，支持可变大小输入输出和跨问题实例的知识迁移。

Result: 即使没有显式自主性模型，该方法也能接近真实解（差距约3-4%），而忽略自主性会导致较大差距（约35-40%）。

Conclusion: 自主感知聚类框架能有效捕捉数据动态，显著提升聚类质量，且退火过程表现出相变特性，有助于设计高效退火策略。

Abstract: Clustering arises in a wide range of problem formulations, yet most existing
approaches assume that the entities under clustering are passive and strictly
conform to their assigned groups. In reality, entities often exhibit local
autonomy, overriding prescribed associations in ways not fully captured by
feature representations. Such autonomy can substantially reshape clustering
outcomes -- altering cluster compositions, geometry, and cardinality -- with
significant downstream effects on inference and decision-making. We introduce
autonomy-aware clustering, a reinforcement (RL) learning framework that learns
and accounts for the influence of local autonomy without requiring prior
knowledge of its form. Our approach integrates RL with a deterministic
annealing (DA) procedure, where, to determine underlying clusters, DA naturally
promotes exploration in early stages of annealing and transitions to
exploitation later. We also show that the annealing procedure exhibits phase
transitions that enable design of efficient annealing schedules. To further
enhance adaptability, we propose the Adaptive Distance Estimation Network
(ADEN), a transformer-based attention model that learns dependencies between
entities and cluster representatives within the RL loop, accommodates
variable-sized inputs and outputs, and enables knowledge transfer across
diverse problem instances. Empirical results show that our framework closely
aligns with underlying data dynamics: even without explicit autonomy models, it
achieves solutions close to the ground truth (gap ~3-4%), whereas ignoring
autonomy leads to substantially larger gaps (~35-40%). The code and data are
publicly available at https://github.com/salar96/AutonomyAwareClustering.

Conclusion: 该研究首次为扩展动作空间的在线学习问题提供了次线性遗憾界，提出的双重乐观算法有效解决了动作生成与选择的权衡问题。

Abstract: With advances in generative AI, decision-making agents can now dynamically
create new actions during online learning, but action generation typically
incurs costs that must be balanced against potential benefits. We study an
online learning problem where an agent can generate new actions at any time
step by paying a one-time cost, with these actions becoming permanently
available for future use. The challenge lies in learning the optimal sequence
of two-fold decisions: which action to take and when to generate new ones,
further complicated by the triangular tradeoffs among exploitation, exploration
and $\textit{creation}$. To solve this problem, we propose a doubly-optimistic
algorithm that employs Lower Confidence Bounds (LCB) for action selection and
Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) for action generation. Empirical evaluation on
healthcare question-answering datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves
favorable generation-quality tradeoffs compared to baseline strategies. From
theoretical perspectives, we prove that our algorithm achieves the optimal
regret of $O(T^{\frac{d}{d+2}}d^{\frac{d}{d+2}} + d\sqrt{T\log T})$, providing
the first sublinear regret bound for online learning with expanding action
spaces.

We demonstrate this approach by formulating a neural network architecture
directly on the lognormal statistical manifold. The construction is driven by
the Hamiltonian system that is equivalent to the gradient flow on this
manifold. First, we define the network's input values using the coordinate
system of this Hamiltonian dynamics, naturally embedded in the Poincare disk.
The core of our contribution lies in the derivation of the network's components
from geometric principles: the rotation component of the synaptic weight matrix
is determined by the Lie group action of SU(1,1) on the disk, while the
activation function emerges from the symplectic structure of the system. We
subsequently obtain the complete weight matrix, including its translation
vector, and the resulting output values. This work shows that the lognormal
manifold can be seamlessly viewed as a neural manifold, with its geometric
properties dictating a unique and interpretable neural network structure. The
proposed method offers a new paradigm for building learning systems grounded in
the differential geometry of their underlying parameter spaces.

Conclusion: 来自物理无关预训练的表征为数据高效的算子学习提供了强大基础

Abstract: Industrial design evaluation often relies on high-fidelity simulations of
governing partial differential equations (PDEs). While accurate, these
simulations are computationally expensive, making dense exploration of design
spaces impractical. Operator learning has emerged as a promising approach to
accelerate PDE solution prediction; however, its effectiveness is often limited
by the scarcity of labeled physics-based data. At the same time, large numbers
of geometry-only candidate designs are readily available but remain largely
untapped. We propose a two-stage framework to better exploit this abundant,
physics-agnostic resource and improve supervised operator learning under
limited labeled data. In Stage 1, we pretrain an autoencoder on a geometry
reconstruction task to learn an expressive latent representation without PDE
labels. In Stage 2, the neural operator is trained in a standard supervised
manner to predict PDE solutions, using the pretrained latent embeddings as
inputs instead of raw point clouds. Transformer-based architectures are adopted
for both the autoencoder and the neural operator to handle point cloud data and
integrate both stages seamlessly. Across four PDE datasets and three
state-of-the-art transformer-based neural operators, our approach consistently
improves prediction accuracy compared to models trained directly on raw point
cloud inputs. These results demonstrate that representations from
physics-agnostic pretraining provide a powerful foundation for data-efficient
operator learning.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种考虑干预后选择偏倚的因果发现新框架，通过建模样本在干预后被选择性纳入数据集的机制，解决了传统方法因忽略选择偏倚而导致的因果关系误判问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生物研究等实际场景中，样本往往在干预后被选择性纳入数据集（如基因表达分析中的质量控制），这种干预后选择偏倚会引入伪依赖关系，扭曲因果发现结果。现有因果发现方法普遍忽略这一问题。

Method: 提出了新的因果建模框架，显式建模干预后选择过程；定义了FI-Markov等价类和F-PAG图表示；开发了F-FCI算法，利用观测和干预数据识别因果关系、潜在混杂因素和选择偏倚。

Conclusion: 干预后选择偏倚是因果发现中的重要挑战，通过显式建模选择机制可以更准确地识别因果关系，超越传统等价类的限制。

Abstract: Interventional causal discovery seeks to identify causal relations by
leveraging distributional changes introduced by interventions, even in the
presence of latent confounders. Beyond the spurious dependencies induced by
latent confounders, we highlight a common yet often overlooked challenge in the
problem due to post-treatment selection, in which samples are selectively
included in datasets after interventions. This fundamental challenge widely
exists in biological studies; for example, in gene expression analysis, both
observational and interventional samples are retained only if they meet quality
control criteria (e.g., highly active cells). Neglecting post-treatment
selection may introduce spurious dependencies and distributional changes under
interventions, which can mimic causal responses, thereby distorting causal
discovery results and challenging existing causal formulations. To address
this, we introduce a novel causal formulation that explicitly models
post-treatment selection and reveals how its differential reactions to
interventions can distinguish causal relations from selection patterns,
allowing us to go beyond traditional equivalence classes toward the underlying
true causal structure. We then characterize its Markov properties and propose a
Fine-grained Interventional equivalence class, named FI-Markov equivalence,
represented by a new graphical diagram, F-PAG. Finally, we develop a provably
sound and complete algorithm, F-FCI, to identify causal relations, latent
confounders, and post-treatment selection up to $\mathcal{FI}$-Markov
equivalence, using both observational and interventional data. Experimental
results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method
recovers causal relations despite the presence of both selection and latent
confounders.

from ECG signals, emphasizing diagnostic accuracy and interpretability using
Explainable AI. The proposed system integrates ensemble learning techniques,
i.e., an optimized Random Forest known as CardioForest, and models like XGBoost

accuracy, balanced accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC, and error
rate (RMSE, MAE) measures. In addition, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
was used to ascertain model explainability and clinical relevance. The
CardioForest model performed best on all metrics, achieving a test accuracy of
94.95%, a balanced accuracy of 88.31%, and high precision and recall metrics.
SHAP analysis confirmed the model's ability to rank the most relevant ECG
features, such as QRS duration, in accordance with clinical intuitions, thereby
fostering trust and usability in clinical practice. The findings recognize
CardioForest as an extremely dependable and interpretable WCT detection model.
Being able to offer accurate predictions and transparency through
explainability makes it a valuable tool to help cardiologists make timely and
well-informed diagnoses, especially for high-stakes and emergency scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GRPO算法中当响应组内所有响应获得相同奖励时出现的优势消失问题，提高强化学习验证奖励(RLVR)方法的采样效率。

Method: 提出自适应采样和响应重用两种技术：自适应采样动态分配更多响应给困难提示，在简单提示上节省计算；响应重用利用先前生成的正確响应提供有用训练信号。

Result: 在7B和8B模型上，AR3PO持续优于GRPO，性能与DAPO相当或更好，采样成本降低达4.2倍；在32B模型上，AR3PO在相似训练步数下达到与DAPO相当性能，同时保持显著更低的采样成本。

Conclusion: AR3PO通过自适应采样和响应重用有效解决了GRPO的优势消失问题，在保持高性能的同时大幅降低了RLVR算法的采样成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive reasoning performance,
with reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) emerging as a
standard paradigm for post-training. A representative algorithm, group relative
policy optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), computes advantages by
normalizing outcome rewards within response groups, but suffers from a
vanishing advantage issue when all responses in a group receive identical
rewards. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive Rollout and Response Reuse
Policy Optimization (AR3PO), a sampling efficient RLVR algorithm that
introduces two novel techniques: adaptive rollout, which dynamically allocates
more responses to difficult prompts while saving computation on easier ones,
and response reuse, which leverages previously generated correct responses to
provide useful training signals. We compare AR3PO with strong RLVR baselines on
multiple representative benchmarks using two different families of base models.
Across the 7B and 8B models, AR3PO consistently outperforms GRPO and matches or
surpasses DAPO (Yu et al., 2025), reducing rollout cost by up to 4.2x. On the
larger 32B model, AR3PO achieves comparable performance to DAPO at similar
training steps while maintaining substantially lower rollout cost.

Motivation: 大语言模型在强化学习中表现优异，但需要中期训练阶段来识别有用的动作集合，并实现快速选择。

Method: 提出Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3)算法，通过顺序变分下界优化，迭代发现时间一致的潜在结构，并在引导数据上进行微调。

Result: 在代码生成任务中，RA3在HumanEval和MBPP上分别比基础模型和下一个token预测基线平均提升8和4个百分点，在RLVR中实现更快收敛和更高渐近性能。

Conclusion: 中期训练在决策空间紧凑且有效视野较短时最有效，强调在动作抽象空间而非原始动作空间操作的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models excel with reinforcement learning (RL), but fully
unlocking this potential requires a mid-training stage. An effective
mid-training phase should identify a compact set of useful actions and enable
fast selection among them through online RL. We formalize this intuition by
presenting the first theoretical result on how mid-training shapes
post-training: it characterizes an action subspace that minimizes both the
value approximation error from pruning and the RL error during subsequent
planning. Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training
effectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL
policy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which
that policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that
mid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the
effective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the
space of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these
insights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable
mid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower
bound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent
structures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data.
Experiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. Across multiple base models, RA3 improves the average performance on
HumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points over the base model and the next-token
prediction baseline. Furthermore, RA3 achieves faster convergence and higher
asymptotic performance in RLVR on HumanEval+, MBPP+, LiveCodeBench, and
Codeforces.

Motivation: 现实世界系统通常是去中心化和异步的，玩家可以随时进入或离开系统，且没有全局时钟，这带来了碰撞避免和玩家数量检测两大挑战。

Method: 开发了一种新算法，玩家在探索和利用之间自适应切换。探索时均匀拉动手臂减少碰撞概率，同时以较小概率继续拉其他玩家正在利用的手臂来检测玩家离开。

Result: 算法实现了$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T \log T} + {\log T}/{\Delta^2})$的遗憾度，其中$\Delta$是任意两个臂期望奖励的最小差距。

Conclusion: 这是首个在异步去中心化环境中高效的多玩家多臂老虎机算法，实验验证了其有效性和鲁棒性，适用于现实场景。

Abstract: In recent years, multi-player multi-armed bandits (MP-MAB) have been
extensively studied due to their wide applications in cognitive radio networks
and Internet of Things systems. While most existing research on MP-MAB focuses
on synchronized settings, real-world systems are often decentralized and
asynchronous, where players may enter or leave the system at arbitrary times,
and do not have a global clock. This decentralized asynchronous setting
introduces two major challenges. First, without a global time, players cannot
implicitly coordinate their actions through time, making it difficult to avoid
collisions. Second, it is important to detect how many players are in the
system, but doing so may cost a lot. In this paper, we address the challenges
posed by such a fully asynchronous setting in a decentralized environment. We
develop a novel algorithm in which players adaptively change between
exploration and exploitation. During exploration, players uniformly pull their
arms, reducing the probability of collisions and effectively mitigating the
first challenge. Meanwhile, players continue pulling arms currently exploited
by others with a small probability, enabling them to detect when a player has
left, thereby addressing the second challenge. We prove that our algorithm
achieves a regret of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T \log T} + {\log T}/{\Delta^2})$,
where $\Delta$ is the minimum expected reward gap between any two arms. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first efficient MP-MAB algorithm in the
asynchronous and decentralized environment. Extensive experiments further
validate the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm, demonstrating its
applicability to real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: Kairos是一个灵活的时间序列基础模型框架，通过动态分块标记化和实例自适应位置嵌入来解决时间序列信息密度不均的问题，在零样本基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列基础模型在处理信息密度随时间变化不均的时间序列时面临挑战，现有方法采用非自适应处理流程，无法捕捉这种动态特性。固定大小的分块标记化和统一位置编码限制了模型适应不同信息密度和周期性变化的能力。

Method: 提出Kairos框架，包含动态分块标记化器和实例自适应位置嵌入。该框架根据每个时间序列实例的独特特征自适应选择标记化粒度和定制位置编码。在3000亿时间点的大规模可预测性分层时间序列语料库上进行训练，并在推理阶段采用多分块预测策略。

Result: 在两个常见的零样本基准测试（GIFT-Eval和Time-Series-Library基准）上，Kairos以更少的参数实现了卓越性能，在多样化任务中持续优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Kairos通过自适应处理机制有效解决了时间序列信息密度不均的建模挑战，为时间序列基础模型提供了更灵活和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
time series analysis, driven by large-scale pretraining on diverse data
corpora. However, time series inherently exhibit heterogeneous information
density over time, influenced by system states and signal complexity,
presenting significant modeling challenges especially in a zero-shot scenario.
Current TSFMs rely on non-adaptive processing pipelines that fail to capture
this dynamic nature. For example, common tokenization strategies such as
fixed-size patching enforce rigid observational granularity, limiting their
ability to adapt to varying information densities. Similarly, conventional
positional encodings impose a uniform temporal scale, making it difficult to
model diverse periodicities and trends across series. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Kairos, a flexible TSFM framework that integrates a
dynamic patching tokenizer and an instance-adaptive positional embedding.
Kairos adaptively selects tokenization granularity and tailors positional
encodings to the unique characteristics of each time series instance. Trained
on a large-scale Predictability-Stratified Time Series (PreSTS) corpus
comprising over 300 billion time points and adopting a multi-patch prediction
strategy in the inference stage, Kairos achieves superior performance with much
fewer parameters on two common zero-shot benchmarks, GIFT-Eval and the
Time-Series-Library benchmark, consistently outperforming established methods
across diverse tasks. The project page is at

Motivation: 多模态模型往往过度依赖主导模态而无法达到最优性能，现有方法主要关注训练目标或优化过程，数据中心的解决方案仍未被充分探索。

Method: 提出MIDAS数据增强策略：1）生成语义不一致的跨模态错位样本；2）使用弱模态加权动态增加最不自信模态的损失权重；3）使用难样本加权优先处理语义模糊的错位样本。

Result: 在多个多模态分类基准测试中，MIDAS显著优于相关基线方法，有效解决了模态不平衡问题。

Conclusion: MIDAS通过数据中心的错位样本生成和双重加权机制，成功解决了多模态模型中的模态不平衡问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Multimodal models often over-rely on dominant modalities, failing to achieve
optimal performance. While prior work focuses on modifying training objectives
or optimization procedures, data-centric solutions remain underexplored. We
propose MIDAS, a novel data augmentation strategy that generates misaligned
samples with semantically inconsistent cross-modal information, labeled using
unimodal confidence scores to compel learning from contradictory signals.
However, this confidence-based labeling can still favor the more confident
modality. To address this within our misaligned samples, we introduce
weak-modality weighting, which dynamically increases the loss weight of the
least confident modality, thereby helping the model fully utilize weaker
modality. Furthermore, when misaligned features exhibit greater similarity to
the aligned features, these misaligned samples pose a greater challenge,
thereby enabling the model to better distinguish between classes. To leverage
this, we propose hard-sample weighting, which prioritizes such semantically
ambiguous misaligned samples. Experiments on multiple multimodal classification
benchmarks demonstrate that MIDAS significantly outperforms related baselines
in addressing modality imbalance.

Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法使用softmax匹配概率会模糊有价值的logit信息，而直接logit蒸馏又无法处理logit平移不变性，限制了解决方案空间。

Method: CSD通过离散分数匹配目标，对齐学生和教师模型在所有词汇对上的相对logit差异，并解决了自回归LLM中离散分数匹配的训练不稳定性和二次复杂度问题。

Result: 在GPT-2-1.5B、OpenLLaMA-7B和GEMMA-7B-IT上的实验表明，CSD持续超越现有KD目标，实现更好的保真度-多样性权衡，并与在线策略技术结合产生互补增益。

Conclusion: CSD展示了在大语言模型蒸馏中的可扩展性和有效性，为高效推理提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver remarkable performance but are costly to
deploy, motivating knowledge distillation (KD) for efficient inference.
Existing KD objectives typically match student and teacher probabilities via
softmax, which blurs valuable logit information. While direct logit
distillation (DLD) mitigates softmax smoothing, it fails to account for logit
shift invariance, thereby restricting the solution space. We propose Concrete
Score Distillation (CSD), a discrete score-matching objective that overcomes
both softmax-induced smoothing and restrictions on the optimal solution set. We
resolve the training instability and quadratic complexity of discrete
score-matching in autoregressive LLMs, and the resulting CSD objective aligns
relative logit differences across all vocabulary pairs between student and
teacher with flexible weighting. We provide both mode-seeking and mode-covering
instances within our framework and evaluate CSD on task-agnostic
instruction-following and task-specific distillation using GPT-2-1.5B,
OpenLLaMA-7B, and GEMMA-7B-IT. Experiments show that CSD consistently surpasses
recent KD objectives, achieves favorable fidelity-diversity trade-offs, and
yields complementary gains when combined with on-policy techniques,
demonstrating its scalability and effectiveness for LLM distillation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向模糊决策系统的空间感知可分性特征选择方法S^2FS，通过整合标量距离和空间方向信息来联合考虑类内紧凑性和类间分离性，在分类准确率和聚类性能上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征选择方法要么无法直接与学习性能对齐，要么仅依赖非方向性欧氏距离来捕捉决策类间关系，限制了决策边界的清晰度。实例的空间分布对决策边界清晰度有潜在影响。

Method: 提出S^2FS框架，采用空间感知可分性准则，结合标量距离和空间方向信息，使用前向贪婪策略迭代选择最具判别性的特征。

Result: 在10个真实数据集上的实验表明，S^2FS在分类准确率和聚类性能上持续优于8种最先进的特征选择算法，特征可视化进一步证实了所选特征的可解释性。

Conclusion: S^2FS通过空间感知可分性准则有效提升了模糊决策系统的特征选择性能，在保持可解释性的同时显著改善了预测性能。

Abstract: Feature selection is crucial for fuzzy decision systems (FDSs), as it
identifies informative features and eliminates rule redundancy, thereby
enhancing predictive performance and interpretability. Most existing methods
either fail to directly align evaluation criteria with learning performance or
rely solely on non-directional Euclidean distances to capture relationships
among decision classes, which limits their ability to clarify decision
boundaries. However, the spatial distribution of instances has a potential
impact on the clarity of such boundaries. Motivated by this, we propose
Spatially-aware Separability-driven Feature Selection (S$^2$FS), a novel
framework for FDSs guided by a spatially-aware separability criterion. This
criterion jointly considers within-class compactness and between-class
separation by integrating scalar-distances with spatial directional
information, providing a more comprehensive characterization of class
structures. S$^2$FS employs a forward greedy strategy to iteratively select the
most discriminative features. Extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets
demonstrate that S$^2$FS consistently outperforms eight state-of-the-art
feature selection algorithms in both classification accuracy and clustering
performance, while feature visualizations further confirm the interpretability
of the selected features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM自我改进方法采用均匀探索预算分配，导致简单任务持续成功、困难任务持续失败，在GRPO训练中产生零梯度问题，限制了学习效果。

Method: 将每个任务的探索视为具有不同"价值"和"成本"的"物品"，建立与经典背包问题的联系，推导出自适应分配规则，根据模型当前学习状态动态调整资源分配。

Result: 在GRPO训练中，非零策略梯度的有效比例提高了20-40%；能够为特别困难的问题分配更大的预算（如93次rollout）；在数学推理基准上平均提升2-4分，特定任务峰值提升9分；相比传统均匀分配节省约2倍计算资源。

Conclusion: 该方法通过智能探索预算分配，在不增加总计算成本的情况下显著提升了LLM自我改进的效果，为强化学习训练提供了计算"免费午餐"。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can self-improve through reinforcement learning,
where they generate trajectories to explore and discover better solutions.
However, this exploration process is computationally expensive, often forcing
current methods to assign limited exploration budgets to each task. This
uniform allocation creates problematic edge cases: easy tasks consistently
succeed while difficult tasks consistently fail, both producing zero gradients
during training updates for the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO). We address this problem from the lens of exploration budget allocation.
Viewing each task's exploration as an "item" with a distinct "value" and
"cost", we establish a connection to the classical knapsack problem. This
formulation allows us to derive an optimal assignment rule that adaptively
distributes resources based on the model's current learning status. When
applied to GRPO, our method increases the effective ratio of non-zero policy
gradients by 20-40% during training. Acting as a computational "free lunch",
our approach could reallocate exploration budgets from tasks where learning is
saturated to those where it is most impactful. This enables significantly
larger budgets (e.g., 93 rollouts) for especially challenging problems, which
would be computationally prohibitive under a uniform allocation. These
improvements translate to meaningful gains on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, with average improvements of 2-4 points and peak gains of 9 points
on specific tasks. Notably, achieving comparable performance with traditional
homogeneous allocation would require about 2x the computational resources.

Conclusion: 强化学习指导的数据选择方法具有很大潜力，能够在严格数据预算下实现高效模型微调。

Abstract: Data selection for finetuning Large Language Models (LLMs) can be framed as a
budget-constrained optimization problem: maximizing a model's downstream
performance under a strict training data budget. Solving this problem is
generally intractable, and existing approximate approaches are
pretraining-oriented and transfer poorly to the fine-tuning setting. We
reformulate this problem as a tractable Markov Decision Process (MDP) and train
agents using various Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods to learn optimal data
selection policies, guided by an efficient, proxy-model-based reward signal.
Across four datasets, training on a $5\%$ subset selected by our approach
matches or outperforms fine-tuning on the full dataset by up to $10.8$ accuracy
points, while cutting wall-clock training time by up to $2 \times$,
highlighting the promise of RL-guided data selection.

typically updated along a single stochastic gradient direction, leaving the
rich local structure of the parameter space unexplored. Previous work has shown
that the surrogate gradient is often poorly correlated with the true reward
landscape. Building on this insight, we visualize the parameter space spanned
by policy checkpoints within an iteration and reveal that higher performing
solutions often lie in nearby unexplored regions. To exploit this opportunity,
we introduce ExploRLer, a pluggable pipeline that seamlessly integrates with
on-policy algorithms such as PPO and TRPO, systematically probing the
unexplored neighborhoods of surrogate on-policy gradient updates. Without
increasing the number of gradient updates, ExploRLer achieves significant
improvements over baselines in complex continuous control environments. Our
results demonstrate that iteration-level exploration provides a practical and
effective way to strengthen on-policy reinforcement learning and offer a fresh
perspective on the limitations of the surrogate objective.

TL;DR: 提出MS-PAFL框架，通过模型分割和隐私放大技术，在联邦学习中实现更好的隐私-效用权衡，减少差分隐私噪声对模型精度的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中差分隐私保护会因添加噪声而严重降低模型精度，需要解决这一挑战。

Method: 将客户端模型分割为私有子模型（本地保留）和公共子模型（全局聚合），仅在公共子模型注入校准高斯噪声，结合随机客户端参与和本地数据子采样实现隐私放大。

Result: 理论分析显示MS-PAFL显著减少满足目标隐私保护水平所需的噪声量，实验验证其在强隐私保证下训练高精度模型的优越性。

Conclusion: MS-PAFL通过模型分割和隐私放大技术，在联邦学习中实现了卓越的隐私-效用权衡，能够训练高精度模型同时提供强隐私保护。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) often adopts differential privacy (DP) to protect
client data, but the added noise required for privacy guarantees can
substantially degrade model accuracy. To resolve this challenge, we propose
model-splitting privacy-amplified federated learning (MS-PAFL), a novel
framework that combines structural model splitting with statistical privacy
amplification. In this framework, each client's model is partitioned into a
private submodel, retained locally, and a public submodel, shared for global
aggregation. The calibrated Gaussian noise is injected only into the public
submodel, thereby confining its adverse impact while preserving the utility of
the local model. We further present a rigorous theoretical analysis that
characterizes the joint privacy amplification achieved through random client
participation and local data subsampling under this architecture. The analysis
provides tight bounds on both single-round and total privacy loss,
demonstrating that MS-PAFL significantly reduces the noise necessary to satisfy
a target privacy protection level. Extensive experiments validate our
theoretical findings, showing that MS-PAFL consistently attains a superior
privacy-utility trade-off and enables the training of highly accurate models
under strong privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: 验证了多重神经预测定理，建立了动态性能边界，为未来研究指明了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Neural Forecasters (NFs) are a cornerstone of Long-term Time Series
Forecasting (LTSF). However, progress has been hampered by an overemphasis on
architectural complexity at the expense of fundamental forecasting principles.
In this work, we return to first principles to redesign the LTSF paradigm. We
begin by introducing a Multiple Neural Forecasting Theorem that provides a
theoretical basis for our approach. We propose Boosted Direct Output (BDO), a
novel forecasting strategy that synergistically combines the advantages of both
Auto-Regressive (AR) and Direct Output (DO). In addition, we stabilize the
learning process by smoothly tracking the model's parameters. Extensive
experiments show that these principled improvements enable a simple MLP to
achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent, complex models in
nearly all cases, without any specific considerations in the area. Finally, we
empirically verify our theorem, establishing a dynamic performance bound and
identifying promising directions for future research. The code for review is

Abstract: Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs) are a very fast and
energy-efficient alternative to conventional feed-forward networks. With
learnable combinations of logical gates, DLGNs enable fast inference by
hardware-friendly execution. Since the concept of DLGNs has only recently
gained attention, these networks are still in their developmental infancy,
including the design and scalability of their output layer. To date, this
architecture has primarily been tested on datasets with up to ten classes.
  This work examines the behavior of DLGNs on large multi-class datasets. We
investigate its general expressiveness, its scalability, and evaluate
alternative output strategies. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we
provide key insights into the importance of temperature tuning and its impact
on output layer performance. We evaluate conditions under which the Group-Sum
layer performs well and how it can be applied to large-scale classification of
up to 2000 classes.

Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing multiple, frequently conflicting, molecular
properties is a key bottleneck in the development of novel therapeutics.
Although a promising approach, the efficacy of multi-task learning is often
compromised by destructive gradient interference, especially in the data-scarce
regimes common to drug discovery. To address this, we propose AIM, an
optimization framework that learns a dynamic policy to mediate gradient
conflicts. The policy is trained jointly with the main network using a novel
augmented objective composed of dense, differentiable regularizers. This
objective guides the policy to produce updates that are geometrically stable
and dynamically efficient, prioritizing progress on the most challenging tasks.
We demonstrate that AIM achieves statistically significant improvements over
multi-task baselines on subsets of the QM9 and targeted protein degraders
benchmarks, with its advantage being most pronounced in data-scarce regimes.
Beyond performance, AIM's key contribution is its interpretability; the learned
policy matrix serves as a diagnostic tool for analyzing inter-task
relationships. This combination of data-efficient performance and diagnostic
insight highlights the potential of adaptive optimizers to accelerate
scientific discovery by creating more robust and insightful models for
multi-property molecular design.

Abstract: Autonomous Raman instruments on Mars rovers, deep-sea landers, and field
robots must interpret raw spectra distorted by fluorescence baselines, peak
shifts, and limited ground-truth labels. Using curated subsets of the RRUFF
database, we evaluate one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
report four advances: (i) Baseline-independent classification: compact CNNs
surpass $k$-nearest-neighbors and support-vector machines on handcrafted
features, removing background-correction and peak-picking stages while ensuring
reproducibility through released data splits and scripts. (ii)
Pooling-controlled robustness: tuning a single pooling parameter accommodates
Raman shifts up to $30 \,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, balancing translational invariance
with spectral resolution. (iii) Label-efficient learning: semi-supervised
generative adversarial networks and contrastive pretraining raise accuracy by
up to $11\%$ with only $10\%$ labels, valuable for autonomous deployments with
scarce annotation. (iv) Constant-time adaptation: freezing the CNN backbone and
retraining only the softmax layer transfers models to unseen minerals at
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ cost, outperforming Siamese networks on resource-limited
processors. This workflow, which involves training on raw spectra, tuning
pooling, adding semi-supervision when labels are scarce, and fine-tuning
lightly for new targets, provides a practical path toward robust, low-footprint
Raman classification in autonomous exploration.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm across multiple
entities while preserving data privacy. However, with the continuous emergence
of new data and increasing model diversity, traditional federated learning
faces significant challenges, including inherent issues of data heterogeneity,
model heterogeneity and catastrophic forgetting, along with new challenge of
knowledge misalignment. In this study, we introduce FedDCL, a novel framework
designed to enable data-free continual learning of the server model in a
model-heterogeneous federated setting. We leverage pre-trained diffusion models
to extract lightweight class-specific prototypes, which confer a threefold
data-free advantage, enabling: (1) generation of synthetic data for the current
task to augment training and counteract non-IID data distributions; (2)
exemplar-free generative replay for retaining knowledge from previous tasks;
and (3) data-free dynamic knowledge transfer from heterogeneous clients to the
server. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of FedDCL, showcasing its potential to enhance the generalizability and
practical applicability of federated learning in dynamic settings.

Abstract: Within the PAC-Bayesian framework, the Gibbs classifier (defined on a
posterior $Q$) and the corresponding $Q$-weighted majority vote classifier are
commonly used to analyze the generalization performance. However, there exists
a notable lack in theoretical research exploring the certified robustness of
majority vote classifier and its interplay with generalization. In this study,
we develop a generalization error bound that possesses a certified robust
radius for the smoothed majority vote classifier (i.e., the $Q$-weighted
majority vote classifier with smoothed inputs); In other words, the
generalization bound holds under any data perturbation within the certified
robust radius. As a byproduct, we find that the underpinnings of both the
generalization bound and the certified robust radius draw, in part, upon weight
spectral norm, which thereby inspires the adoption of spectral regularization
in smooth training to boost certified robustness. Utilizing the
dimension-independent property of spherical Gaussian inputs in smooth training,
we propose a novel and inexpensive spectral regularizer to enhance the smoothed
majority vote classifier. In addition to the theoretical contribution, a set of
empirical results is provided to substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

Abstract: The Quantum Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem (QSBP) describes the evolution of a
stochastic process between two arbitrary probability distributions, where the
dynamics are governed by the Schr\"odinger equation rather than by the
traditional real-valued wave equation. Although the QSBP is known in the
mathematical literature, we formulate it here from a Lagrangian perspective and
derive its main features in a way that is particularly suited to generative
modeling. We show that the resulting evolution equations involve the so-called
Bohm (quantum) potential, representing a notion of non-locality in the
stochastic process. This distinguishes the QSBP from classical stochastic
dynamics and reflects a key characteristic typical of quantum mechanical
systems. In this work, we derive exact closed-form solutions for the QSBP
between Gaussian distributions. Our derivation is based on solving the
Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE) and the Hamilton-Jacobi Equation (HJE) arising
from the Lagrangian formulation of dynamical Optimal Transport. We find that,
similar to the classical Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem, the solution to the QSBP
between Gaussians is again a Gaussian process; however, the evolution of the
covariance differs due to quantum effects. Leveraging these explicit solutions,
we present a modified algorithm based on a Gaussian Mixture Model framework,
and demonstrate its effectiveness across several experimental settings,
including single-cell evolution data, image generation, molecular translation
and applications in Mean-Field Games.

Conclusion: CAST框架能够高效训练半结构化稀疏模型，建立了准确的经验缩放定律，并在量化和微调场景中展示了实用性。

Abstract: Sparsity-aware training is an effective approach for transforming large
language models (LLMs) into hardware-friendly sparse patterns, thereby reducing
latency and memory consumption during inference. In this paper, we propose
Continuous Adaptive Sparse Trainer (CAST), a fully continuous and
differentiable sparsity-aware training framework for semi-structured (or "N:M")
sparse models. Unlike previous approaches that optimize sparsity patterns and
weights separately, CAST enables seamless joint optimization during training,
while progressively transforming the model into the desired sparsity format.
Specifically, CAST introduces three key components: 1) AdamS, a sparsity-aware
optimizer that leverages adaptive L1 decay to promote uniform sparsification
across all parameters; 2) Weight Scaling, a module designed to mitigate the
magnitude reduction caused by decay while preserving desired sparsity patterns;
3) Knowledge Distillation, which employs the dense model as a self-teacher to
enhance training efficiency. We evaluate CAST under 2:4 sparsity patterns
across multiple model families, ranging from 125M to 13B parameters. Our
results demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art
methods in both perplexity and zero-shot accuracy with minimal training
resources. Notably, on LLaMA2-7B, our 2:4 sparse model achieves a negligible
perplexity increase of 0.09 and a 0.36% gain in zero-shot accuracy compared to
the dense model using only 2% of the original pretraining tokens. Additionally,
we establish an accurate and robust empirical scaling law to predict sparse
model performance given adequate training resources. Finally, we demonstrate
the practical applicability of our sparse models by evaluating them under
quantization and fine-tuning scenarios.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in partially observable environments requires agents
to act under uncertainty from noisy, incomplete observations. Asymmetric
actor-critic methods leverage privileged information during training to improve
learning under these conditions. However, existing approaches typically assume
full-state access during training. In this work, we challenge this assumption
by proposing a novel actor-critic framework, called informed asymmetric
actor-critic, that enables conditioning the critic on arbitrary privileged
signals without requiring access to the full state. We show that policy
gradients remain unbiased under this formulation, extending the theoretical
foundation of asymmetric methods to the more general case of privileged partial
information. To quantify the impact of such signals, we propose informativeness
measures based on kernel methods and return prediction error, providing
practical tools for evaluating training-time signals. We validate our approach
empirically on benchmark navigation tasks and synthetic partially observable
environments, showing that our informed asymmetric method improves learning
efficiency and value estimation when informative privileged inputs are
available. Our findings challenge the necessity of full-state access and open
new directions for designing asymmetric reinforcement learning methods that are
both practical and theoretically sound.

Abstract: The attention mechanism has become a cornerstone of modern deep learning
architectures, where keys and values are typically derived from the same
underlying sequence or representation. This work explores a less conventional
scenario, when keys and values originate from different sequences or
modalities. Specifically, we first analyze the attention mechanism's behavior
under noisy value features, establishing a critical noise threshold beyond
which signal degradation becomes significant. Furthermore, we model context
(key, value) misalignment as an effective form of structured noise within the
value features, demonstrating that the noise induced by such misalignment can
substantially exceed this critical threshold, thereby compromising standard
attention's efficacy. Motivated by this, we introduce Indirect Attention, a
modified attention mechanism that infers relevance indirectly in scenarios with
misaligned context. We evaluate the performance of Indirect Attention across a
range of synthetic tasks and real world applications, showcasing its superior
ability to handle misalignment.

Abstract: Access to credible sustainability information in the fashion industry remains
limited and challenging to interpret, despite growing public and regulatory
demands for transparency. General-purpose language models often lack
domain-specific knowledge and tend to "hallucinate", which is particularly
harmful for fields where factual correctness is crucial. This work explores how
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be applied to classify
sustainability data for fashion brands, thereby addressing the scarcity of
credible and accessible information in this domain. We present a prototype
Fashion Information Tool for Sustainability (FITS), a transformer-based system
that extracts and classifies sustainability information from credible,
unstructured text sources: NGO reports and scientific publications. Several
BERT-based language models, including models pretrained on scientific and
climate-specific data, are fine-tuned on our curated corpus using a
domain-specific classification schema, with hyperparameters optimized via
Bayesian optimization. FITS allows users to search for relevant data, analyze
their own data, and explore the information via an interactive interface. We
evaluated FITS in two focus groups of potential users concerning usability,
visual design, content clarity, possible use cases, and desired features. Our
results highlight the value of domain-adapted NLP in promoting informed
decision-making and emphasize the broader potential of AI applications in
addressing climate-related challenges. Finally, this work provides a valuable
dataset, the SustainableTextileCorpus, along with a methodology for future
updates. Code available at https://github.com/daphne12345/FITS

Motivation: 揭示Muon优化器相比Adam在训练大语言模型时表现更优的内在机制，特别是其在重尾数据分布下的优势。

Method: 通过消融实验分析transformer组件，从关联记忆角度解释Muon的优势，并在理论层面分析单层关联记忆模型在类别不平衡数据下的表现。

Result: 发现Muon的更新规则产生更各向同性的奇异谱，在重尾数据上能更有效地优化尾部类别，而Adam则可能因嵌入特性导致学习误差差异较大。

Conclusion: Muon的核心优势在于其更新规则与线性关联记忆的外积结构对齐，能够在重尾分布中实现更平衡和有效的尾部类别学习。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer is consistently faster than Adam in training Large
Language Models (LLMs), yet the mechanism underlying its success remains
unclear. This paper demystifies this mechanism through the lens of associative
memory. By ablating the transformer components optimized by Muon, we reveal
that the associative memory parameters of LLMs, namely the Value and Output
(VO) attention weights and Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs), are the primary
contributors to Muon's superiority. Motivated by this associative memory view,
we then explain Muon's superiority on real-world corpora, which are
intrinsically heavy-tailed: a few classes (tail classes) appear far less
frequently than others. The superiority is explained through two key
properties: (i) its update rule consistently yields a more isotropic singular
spectrum than Adam; and as a result, (ii) on heavy-tailed data, it optimizes
tail classes more effectively than Adam. Beyond empirical evidence, we
theoretically confirm these findings by analyzing a one-layer associative
memory model under class-imbalanced data. We prove that Muon consistently
achieves balanced learning across classes regardless of feature embeddings,
whereas Adam can induce large disparities in learning errors depending on
embedding properties. In summary, our empirical observations and theoretical
analyses reveal Muon's core advantage: its update rule aligns with the
outer-product structure of linear associative memories, enabling more balanced

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Temporal Experts Averaging (TEA)方法，通过权重平均更新整个模型来解决时序域泛化问题，在保持计算效率的同时最大化泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常只预测分类器层权重，无法调整其他模型组件，限制了泛化能力；而预测完整模型权重计算成本过高。

Method: 1) 在保持参数相似性的前提下，通过在单个时序域上微调基础模型创建功能多样化的专家模型；2) 在主成分子空间中建模时序权重轨迹，基于专家与未来域的投影接近度计算自适应平均系数。

Result: 在7个TDG基准测试、5个模型和2种TDG设置上的实验表明，TEA比现有方法性能提升高达69%，同时效率提升高达60倍。

Conclusion: TEA框架通过权重平均有效解决了时序域泛化问题，在性能和效率方面均显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) aims to generalize across temporal
distribution shifts, e.g., lexical change over time. Prior work often addresses
this by predicting future model weights. However, full model prediction is
prohibitively expensive for even reasonably sized models. Thus, recent methods
only predict the classifier layer, limiting generalization by failing to adjust
other model components. To address this, we propose Temporal Experts Averaging
(TEA), a novel and scalable TDG framework that updates the entire model using
weight averaging to maximize generalization potential while minimizing
computational costs. Our theoretical analysis guides us to two steps that
enhance generalization to future domains. First, we create expert models with
functional diversity yet parameter similarity by fine-tuning a domain-agnostic
base model on individual temporal domains while constraining weight changes.
Second, we optimize the bias-variance tradeoff through adaptive averaging
coefficients derived from modeling temporal weight trajectories in a principal
component subspace. Expert's contributions are based on their projected
proximity to future domains. Extensive experiments across 7 TDG benchmarks, 5
models, and 2 TDG settings shows TEA outperforms prior TDG methods by up to 69%
while being up to 60x more efficient.

TL;DR: DPSBA是一个针对图神经网络分类任务的清洁标签后门攻击框架，通过学习分布内触发器来抑制结构和语义异常，在保持高攻击成功率的同时显著提升隐蔽性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图分类后门攻击方法存在结构异常（罕见子图触发器）和语义异常（标签翻转）问题，导致中毒图容易被异常检测模型发现，需要更隐蔽的攻击方法。

Method: 提出DPSBA框架，通过异常感知判别器指导的对抗训练来学习分布内触发器，有效抑制结构和语义异常。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验验证表明，DPSBA在有效性和可检测性之间实现了优越的平衡，相比现有方法具有更高的攻击成功率和更好的隐蔽性。

Conclusion: DPSBA通过抑制结构和语义异常，实现了更隐蔽的图分类后门攻击，为图神经网络的安全性研究提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance across
tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification,
but remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that implant imperceptible triggers
during training to control predictions. While node-level attacks exploit local
message passing, graph-level attacks face the harder challenge of manipulating
global representations while maintaining stealth. We identify two main sources
of anomaly in existing graph classification backdoor methods: structural
deviation from rare subgraph triggers and semantic deviation caused by label
flipping, both of which make poisoned graphs easily detectable by anomaly
detection models. To address this, we propose DPSBA, a clean-label backdoor
framework that learns in-distribution triggers via adversarial training guided
by anomaly-aware discriminators. DPSBA effectively suppresses both structural
and semantic anomalies, achieving high attack success while significantly
improving stealth. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate that
DPSBA achieves a superior balance between effectiveness and detectability
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: TFPI是一种简单有效的RLVR适配方法，通过ThinkFree操作丢弃思维内容来减少推理时的token使用，提升性能并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR虽然能有效解决复杂任务，但训练时需要极长的上下文长度，导致计算成本高昂。多阶段训练方法效果有限，过短的初始上下文会导致不可逆的性能下降。

Method: 提出TFPI方法，结合长链思维蒸馏和标准RLVR，使用ThinkFree操作通过直接附加</think>标签来显式丢弃思维内容，减少推理时的token使用。

Result: TFPI加速了RL收敛，达到了更高的性能上限，并产生了更token高效推理模型，无需专门的奖励或复杂训练设计。4B模型在AIME24上达到89.0%准确率，LiveCodeBench上达到65.5%。

Conclusion: TFPI是一种简单而有效的方法，能够显著降低RLVR训练的计算成本，同时提升模型性能，为复杂任务的强化学习训练提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) effectively solves
complex tasks but demands extremely long context lengths during training,
leading to substantial computational costs. While multi-stage training can
partially mitigate this, starting with overly short contexts often causes
irreversible performance degradation, ultimately failing to reduce overall
training compute significantly. In this paper, we introduce
**T**hinking-**F**ree **P**olicy **I**nitialization (**TFPI**), a simple yet
effective adaptation to RLVR that bridges long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
distillation and standard RLVR. TFPI employs a simple *ThinkFree* operation,
explicitly discarding the thinking content via a direct *</think>* append, to
reduce token usage during inference. Training with *ThinkFree*-adapted inputs
improves performance and lowers token consumption, even in the original
slow-thinking mode. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks have shown
that TFPI accelerates RL convergence, achieves a higher performance ceiling,
and yields more token-efficient reasoning models without specialized rewards or
complex training designs. With TFPI only, we train a 4B model to reach 89.0%
accuracy on AIME24 and 65.5% on LiveCodeBench using less than 4K H20 hours.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合频谱-时间框架，用于单通道EEG中眼动、肌电和白噪声伪迹的实时检测和分类，通过结合时域滤波和频域分析，使用轻量级MLP实现了高精度和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实环境中EEG伪迹检测面临的挑战：多通道方法计算效率低、对同时噪声鲁棒性差、深度学习模型在准确性和复杂性之间存在权衡。

Method: 结合时域低通滤波（针对低频眼动伪迹）和频域功率谱密度分析（捕获宽频谱肌电伪迹），然后通过PCA优化的特征融合减少冗余，使用轻量级多层感知器进行分类。

Result: 在低信噪比（-7dB）下达到99%准确率，中等噪声（4dB）下超过90%准确率；在同时多源污染情况下保持96%分类准确率；训练时间比CNN快97%。

Conclusion: 该框架弥合了临床适用性和计算效率之间的差距，证明在噪声场景中基于领域知识的特征融合优于复杂架构，挑战了模型深度对EEG伪迹检测的普遍依赖。

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) artifact detection in real-world settings faces
significant challenges such as computational inefficiency in multi-channel
methods, poor robustness to simultaneous noise, and trade-offs between accuracy
and complexity in deep learning models. We propose a hybrid spectral-temporal
framework for real-time detection and classification of ocular (EOG), muscular
(EMG), and white noise artifacts in single-channel EEG. This method, in
contrast to other approaches, combines time-domain low-pass filtering
(targeting low-frequency EOG) and frequency-domain power spectral density (PSD)
analysis (capturing broad-spectrum EMG), followed by PCA-optimized feature
fusion to minimize redundancy while preserving discriminative information. This
feature engineering strategy allows a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
architecture to outperform advanced CNNs and RNNs by achieving 99% accuracy at
low SNRs (SNR -7) dB and >90% accuracy in moderate noise (SNR 4 dB).
Additionally, this framework addresses the unexplored problem of simultaneous
multi-source contamination(EMG+EOG+white noise), where it maintains 96%
classification accuracy despite overlapping artifacts. With 30-second training
times (97% faster than CNNs) and robust performance across SNR levels, this
framework bridges the gap between clinical applicability and computational
efficiency, which enables real-time use in wearable brain-computer interfaces.
This work also challenges the ubiquitous dependence on model depth for EEG
artifact detection by demonstrating that domain-informed feature fusion
surpasses complex architecture in noisy scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文揭示了PPO和GRPO中的裁剪机制会导致熵偏差：clip-low增加熵，clip-high减少熵。在标准参数下，clip-high效应占主导，导致熵减少。通过调整clip-low值可以控制熵，防止RLVR训练中的熵崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR方法在增强大语言模型推理能力方面表现突出，但容易发生熵崩溃问题，导致模型快速收敛到近乎确定性的形式，阻碍探索和训练进展。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析，研究PPO和GRPO中的裁剪机制对熵的影响，揭示clip-low和clip-high的不同效应。

Result: 研究发现标准裁剪参数下clip-high效应占主导，导致整体熵减少，即使提供纯随机奖励也会发生。通过更激进的clip-low值可以增加熵并促进探索。

Conclusion: 裁剪机制是RLVR中被忽视的混杂因素，可以故意用于控制熵，防止熵崩溃，从而改善RLVR训练效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
the leading approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). However, RLVR is prone to entropy collapse, where the LLM
quickly converges to a near-deterministic form, hindering exploration and
progress during prolonged RL training. In this work, we reveal that the
clipping mechanism in PPO and GRPO induces biases on entropy. Through
theoretical and empirical analyses, we show that clip-low increases entropy,
while clip-high decreases it. Further, under standard clipping parameters, the
effect of clip-high dominates, resulting in an overall entropy reduction even
when purely random rewards are provided to the RL algorithm. Our findings
highlight an overlooked confounding factor in RLVR: independent of the reward
signal, the clipping mechanism influences entropy, which in turn affects the
reasoning behavior. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that clipping can be
deliberately used to control entropy. Specifically, with a more aggressive
clip-low value, one can increase entropy, promote exploration, and ultimately
prevent entropy collapse in RLVR training.

TL;DR: 提出了首个用于宏基因组分箱的概率嵌入方法UncertainGen，将DNA片段表示为潜在空间中的概率分布，解决了确定性表示无法捕捉DNA序列不确定性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的确定性表示方法（如k-mer谱或大语言模型嵌入）无法捕捉DNA序列中固有的不确定性，这些不确定性源于物种间DNA共享和具有高度相似表示的片段。

Method: 使用概率嵌入方法，将每个DNA片段表示为潜在空间中的概率分布，引入数据自适应度量，扩展可行潜在空间，实现更灵活的簇分离。

Result: 在真实宏基因组数据集上的实验表明，该方法在分箱任务上优于确定性k-mer和基于LLM的嵌入方法，为大规模宏基因组分析提供了可扩展的轻量级解决方案。

Conclusion: 概率嵌入框架能够自然建模序列级不确定性，提供嵌入可区分性的理论保证，在宏基因组分箱任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Metagenomic binning aims to cluster DNA fragments from mixed microbial
samples into their respective genomes, a critical step for downstream analyses
of microbial communities. Existing methods rely on deterministic
representations, such as k-mer profiles or embeddings from large language
models, which fail to capture the uncertainty inherent in DNA sequences arising
from inter-species DNA sharing and from fragments with highly similar
representations. We present the first probabilistic embedding approach,
UncertainGen, for metagenomic binning, representing each DNA fragment as a
probability distribution in latent space. Our approach naturally models
sequence-level uncertainty, and we provide theoretical guarantees on embedding
distinguishability. This probabilistic embedding framework expands the feasible
latent space by introducing a data-adaptive metric, which in turn enables more
flexible separation of bins/clusters. Experiments on real metagenomic datasets
demonstrate the improvements over deterministic k-mer and LLM-based embeddings
for the binning task by offering a scalable and lightweight solution for
large-scale metagenomic analysis.

TL;DR: 本文分析了超维计算(HDC)在智能制造中的应用，发现HDC超参数与性能的关系在不同应用领域并不稳定。通过信号质量监控和图像缺陷检测两个代表性任务，揭示了编码器类型、维度等参数对性能的影响规律，并开发出匹配或超越深度学习和Transformer模型性能的HDC方案，同时实现6倍推理加速和40倍训练能耗降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能制造需要满足严格延迟和能耗预算的设备端智能。超维计算(HDC)通过将数据编码为高维超向量并提供简单操作，提供了一个轻量级替代方案。但先前研究通常假设HDC超参数与性能之间的定性关系在不同应用中保持稳定，这一假设需要验证。

Method: 分析了两个代表性任务：CNC加工中的信号质量监控和LPBF中的图像缺陷检测。映射了编码器类型、投影方差、超向量维度和数据机制对准确性、推理延迟、训练时间和训练能耗的影响。建立了形式化复杂度模型来解释编码和相似性计算的可预测趋势。

Result: 信号任务偏好非线性随机傅里叶特征编码，图像任务偏好线性随机投影编码。调优后的HDC模型在匹配或超越最先进深度学习和Transformer模型准确性的同时，实现了至少6倍的推理加速和超过40倍的训练能耗降低。

Conclusion: 领域感知的HDC编码是必要的，调优后的HDC为受限硬件上的实时工业AI提供了实用、可扩展的路径。未来工作将实现自适应编码器和超参数选择，扩展到更多制造模式，并在低功耗加速器上进行验证。

Abstract: Smart manufacturing requires on-device intelligence that meets strict latency
and energy budgets. HyperDimensional Computing (HDC) offers a lightweight
alternative by encoding data as high-dimensional hypervectors and computing
with simple operations. Prior studies often assume that the qualitative
relation between HDC hyperparameters and performance is stable across
applications. Our analysis of two representative tasks, signal-based quality
monitoring in Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining and image-based defect
detection in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), shows that this assumption does
not hold. We map how encoder type, projection variance, hypervector
dimensionality, and data regime shape accuracy, inference latency, training
time, and training energy. A formal complexity model explains predictable
trends in encoding and similarity computation and reveals nonmonotonic
interactions with retraining that preclude a closed-form optimum. Empirically,
signals favor nonlinear Random Fourier Features with more exclusive encodings
and saturate in accuracy beyond moderate dimensionality. Images favor linear
Random Projection, achieve high accuracy with small dimensionality, and depend
more on sample count than on dimensionality. Guided by these insights, we tune
HDC under multiobjective constraints that reflect edge deployment and obtain
models that match or exceed the accuracy of state-of-the-art deep learning and
Transformer models while delivering at least 6x faster inference and more than
40x lower training energy. These results demonstrate that domain-aware HDC
encoding is necessary and that tuned HDC offers a practical, scalable path to
real-time industrial AI on constrained hardware. Future work will enable
adaptive encoder and hyperparameter selection, expand evaluation to additional
manufacturing modalities, and validate on low-power accelerators.

Conclusion: 该方法加速了Transformer的性能提升，使其能够以更稳定和快速的方式进行在线训练，同时显著降低计算需求。

Abstract: The appearance of transformer-based models in Reinforcement Learning (RL) has
expanded the horizons of possibilities in robotics tasks, but it has
simultaneously brought a wide range of challenges during its implementation,
especially in model-free online RL. Some of the existing learning algorithms
cannot be easily implemented with transformer-based models due to the
instability of the latter. In this paper, we propose a method that uses the
Accelerator policy as a transformer's trainer. The Accelerator, a simpler and
more stable model, interacts with the environment independently while
simultaneously training the transformer through behavior cloning during the
first stage of the proposed algorithm. In the second stage, the pretrained
transformer starts to interact with the environment in a fully online setting.
As a result, this model-free algorithm accelerates the transformer in terms of
its performance and helps it to train online in a more stable and faster way.
By conducting experiments on both state-based and image-based ManiSkill
environments, as well as on MuJoCo tasks in MDP and POMDP settings, we show
that applying our algorithm not only enables stable training of transformers
but also reduces training time on image-based environments by up to a factor of
two. Moreover, it decreases the required replay buffer size in off-policy
methods to 10-20 thousand, which significantly lowers the overall computational
demands.

Abstract: There is high demand on fire simulations, in both scale and quantity. We
present a multi-pronged approach to improving the time and energy required to
meet these demands. We show the ability of a custom machine learning surrogate
model to predict the dynamics of heat propagation orders of magnitude faster
than state-of-the-art CFD software for this application. We also demonstrate
how a guided optimisation procedure can decrease the number of simulations
required to meet an objective; using lightweight models to decide which
simulations to run, we see a tenfold reduction when locating the most dangerous
location for a fire to occur within a building based on the impact of smoke on
visibility. Finally we present a framework and product, Simvue, through which
we access these tools along with a host of automatic organisational and
tracking features which enables future reuse of data and more savings through
better management of simulations and combating redundancy.

TL;DR: AC-RL通过强化学习训练视觉模型生成包含推理所需关键信息的图像描述，解决了当前视觉语言模型在数学推理任务中因信息缺失导致的性能瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型生成的图像描述通常是为人类读者设计的，会忽略推理系统所需的精确细节，导致推理失败不是由于推理能力限制，而是因为缺乏关键视觉信息。

Method: 提出自适应澄清强化学习(AC-RL)，通过交互训练视觉模型理解推理器需要的信息。核心洞察是利用训练过程中的澄清请求揭示信息差距，通过惩罚需要澄清的成功案例，促使模型生成全面的初始描述。

Result: AC-RL在七个视觉数学推理基准测试中比预训练基线平均准确率提高4.4个百分点，分析显示如果允许澄清请求，可减少高达39%的澄清需求。

Conclusion: 通过将澄清视为隐式监督，AC-RL证明视觉语言接口可以仅通过交互学习，无需显式标注。

Abstract: Recent text-only models demonstrate remarkable mathematical reasoning
capabilities. Extending these to visual domains requires vision-language models
to translate images into text descriptions. However, current models, trained to
produce captions for human readers, often omit the precise details that
reasoning systems require. This creates an interface mismatch: reasoners often
fail not due to reasoning limitations but because they lack access to critical
visual information. We propose Adaptive-Clarification Reinforcement Learning
(AC-RL), which teaches vision models what information reasoners need through
interaction. Our key insight is that clarification requests during training
reveal information gaps; by penalizing success that requires clarification, we
create pressure for comprehensive initial captions that enable the reasoner to
solve the problem in a single pass. AC-RL improves average accuracy by 4.4
points over pretrained baselines across seven visual mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, and analysis shows it would cut clarification requests by up to 39%
if those were allowed. By treating clarification as a form of implicit
supervision, AC-RL demonstrates that vision-language interfaces can be
effectively learned through interaction alone, without requiring explicit
annotations.

Conclusion: AAD为数据受限时提供实用解决方案，无需专门训练即可直接提升推理时的模型对齐性能

Abstract: Alignment of large language models remains a central challenge in natural
language processing. Preference optimization has emerged as a popular and
effective method for improving alignment, typically through training-time or
prompt-based interventions. In this paper, we introduce alignment-aware
decoding (AAD), a method to enhance model alignment directly at inference.
Theoretically, AAD can be interpreted as implicit reward optimization, yet it
requires no specialized training beyond the standard DPO setup. Empirically,
AAD consistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse alignment
benchmarks and model scales. Moreover, in data-constrained settings, AAD can
produce high-quality synthetic data to improve alignment under standard
decoding, providing a practical solution when labeled data is limited.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Process-Supervised RL
(PSRL) has emerged as a more effective paradigm compared to outcome-based RL.
However, existing PSRL approaches suffer from limited exploration efficiency,
both in terms of branching positions and sampling. In this paper, we introduce
a novel PSRL framework (AttnRL), which enables efficient exploration for
reasoning models. Motivated by preliminary observations that steps exhibiting
high attention scores correlate with reasoning behaviors, we propose to branch
from positions with high values. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive sampling
strategy that accounts for problem difficulty and historical batch size,
ensuring that the whole training batch maintains non-zero advantage values. To
further improve sampling efficiency, we design a one-step off-policy training
pipeline for PSRL. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior
approaches in terms of performance and sampling and training efficiency.

Abstract: Mapping informal settlements is crucial for addressing challenges related to
urban planning, public health, and infrastructure in rapidly growing cities.
Geospatial machine learning has emerged as a key tool for detecting and mapping
these areas from remote sensing data. However, existing approaches often treat
spatial units independently, neglecting the relational structure of the urban
fabric. We propose a graph-based framework that explicitly incorporates local
geographical context into the classification process. Each spatial unit (cell)
is embedded in a graph structure along with its adjacent neighbors, and a
lightweight Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is trained to classify whether
the central cell belongs to an informal settlement. Experiments are conducted
on a case study in Rio de Janeiro using spatial cross-validation across five
distinct zones, ensuring robustness and generalizability across heterogeneous
urban landscapes. Our method outperforms standard baselines, improving Kappa
coefficient by 17 points over individual cell classification. We also show that
graph-based modeling surpasses simple feature concatenation of neighboring
cells, demonstrating the benefit of encoding spatial structure for urban scene
understanding.

Abstract: Ensuring optimal Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) is vital for occupant

conventional Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. This
paper proposes a deep learning driven approach to proactively manage IEQ

variables across various time horizons. Our results show that GRU achieves the
best short-term prediction accuracy with lower computational overhead, whereas
CNN-LSTM excels in extracting dominant features for extended forecasting

comparative analysis highlights that prediction reliability depends on data
resolution, sensor placement, and fluctuating occupancy conditions. These
findings provide actionable insights for intelligent Building Management

*Marcello Massimo Negri,Jonathan Aellen,Manuel Jahn,AmirEhsan Khorashadizadeh,Volker Roth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Marginal Flow的密度建模框架，通过将潜在参数边缘化来克服现有方法的训练昂贵、推理缓慢、似然近似、模式崩溃等限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密度建模方法存在训练成本高、推理速度慢、似然近似、模式崩溃或架构限制等问题，需要一种能同时克服这些局限的简单而强大的框架。

Method: 通过定义参数化分布q(x|w)和可学习的分布q_θ(w)，对潜在参数w进行边缘化采样，实现高效密度评估和采样，无需直接优化潜在变量。

Result: 该模型支持精确密度评估，训练和推理速度比竞争模型快几个数量级，能够学习低维流形上的分布，处理多模态目标，并在合成数据集、基于模拟的推理、正定矩阵分布和图像潜在空间流形学习等任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: Marginal Flow是一个灵活且高效的密度建模框架，克服了现有方法的多种限制，在各种任务中展现出卓越性能。

Abstract: Current density modeling approaches suffer from at least one of the following
shortcomings: expensive training, slow inference, approximate likelihood, mode
collapse or architectural constraints like bijective mappings. We propose a
simple yet powerful framework that overcomes these limitations altogether. We
define our model $q_\theta(x)$ through a parametric distribution $q(x|w)$ with
latent parameters $w$. Instead of directly optimizing the latent variables $w$,
our idea is to marginalize them out by sampling $w$ from a learnable
distribution $q_\theta(w)$, hence the name Marginal Flow. In order to evaluate
the learned density $q_\theta(x)$ or to sample from it, we only need to draw
samples from $q_\theta(w)$, which makes both operations efficient. The proposed
model allows for exact density evaluation and is orders of magnitude faster
than competing models both at training and inference. Furthermore, Marginal
Flow is a flexible framework: it does not impose any restrictions on the neural
network architecture, it enables learning distributions on lower-dimensional
manifolds (either known or to be learned), it can be trained efficiently with
any objective (e.g. forward and reverse KL divergence), and it easily handles
multi-modal targets. We evaluate Marginal Flow extensively on various tasks
including synthetic datasets, simulation-based inference, distributions on
positive definite matrices and manifold learning in latent spaces of images.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于高斯过程的锂电析锂检测方法，通过直接建模电荷-电压关系Q(V)来概率性地推断dQ/dV，实现鲁棒的析锂峰值检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速充电过程中的锂析出是关键的退化机制，会加速容量衰减并可能引发安全故障。传统dQ/dV计算方法依赖有限差分和滤波，会放大传感器噪声并引入峰值位置偏差。

Method: 使用高斯过程框架直接建模电荷-电压关系Q(V)作为随机过程，利用GP导数仍然是GP的特性，从后验分布中分析性和概率性地推断dQ/dV，无需特殊平滑处理。

Result: 在锂离子纽扣电池上的实验验证表明，该方法在低温、高速充电条件下可靠检测析锂峰值，在基准情况下正确报告无峰值。GP识别的微分峰值与减少的电荷通量和容量衰减一致。

Conclusion: 该方法建立了实时锂析出检测的实用途径，具有噪声感知推理、闭式导数不确定性量化和在线变体可扩展性等关键优势。

Abstract: Lithium plating during fast charging is a critical degradation mechanism that
accelerates capacity fade and can trigger catastrophic safety failures. Recent
work has identified a distinctive dQ/dV peak above 4.0 V as a reliable
signature of plating onset; however, conventional methods for computing dQ/dV
rely on finite differencing with filtering, which amplifies sensor noise and
introduces bias in peak location. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian Process
(GP) framework for lithium plating detection by directly modeling the
charge-voltage relationship Q(V) as a stochastic process with calibrated
uncertainty. Leveraging the property that derivatives of GPs remain GPs, we
infer dQ/dV analytically and probabilistically from the posterior, enabling
robust detection without ad hoc smoothing. The framework provides three key
benefits: (i) noise-aware inference with hyperparameters learned from data,
(ii) closed-form derivatives with credible intervals for uncertainty
quantification, and (iii) scalability to online variants suitable for embedded
BMS. Experimental validation on Li-ion coin cells across a range of C-rates
(0.2C-1C) and temperatures (0-40\deg C) demonstrates that the GP-based method
reliably detects plating peaks under low-temperature, high-rate charging, while
correctly reporting no peaks in baseline cases. The concurrence of
GP-identified differential peaks, reduced charge throughput, and capacity fade
measured via reference performance tests confirms the method's accuracy and
robustness, establishing a practical pathway for real-time lithium plating
detection.

*James Oldfield,Philip Torr,Ioannis Patras,Adel Bibi,Fazl Barez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出截断多项式分类器（TPCs），用于动态监控LLM激活，实现按需调整计算成本的安全监控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统安全监控器对所有查询使用相同计算量，导致资源浪费或漏检风险。需要灵活监控器，仅在困难输入或计算资源充足时增加成本。

Method: TPCs是线性探针的自然扩展，通过逐项训练和评估多项式实现渐进式监控。支持两种使用模式：安全拨盘模式和自适应级联模式。

Result: 在两个大规模安全数据集（WildGuardMix和BeaverTails）上，对4个最多30B参数的模型测试，TPCs在同等规模下与MLP基线相当或更优，且更具可解释性。

Conclusion: TPCs提供灵活高效的安全监控方案，可根据需求调整计算强度，在保证安全性的同时优化资源使用。

Abstract: Monitoring large language models' (LLMs) activations is an effective way to
detect harmful requests before they lead to unsafe outputs. However,
traditional safety monitors often require the same amount of compute for every
query. This creates a trade-off: expensive monitors waste resources on easy
inputs, while cheap ones risk missing subtle cases. We argue that safety
monitors should be flexible--costs should rise only when inputs are difficult
to assess, or when more compute is available. To achieve this, we introduce
Truncated Polynomial Classifiers (TPCs), a natural extension of linear probes
for dynamic activation monitoring. Our key insight is that polynomials can be
trained and evaluated progressively, term-by-term. At test-time, one can
early-stop for lightweight monitoring, or use more terms for stronger
guardrails when needed. TPCs provide two modes of use. First, as a safety dial:
by evaluating more terms, developers and regulators can "buy" stronger
guardrails from the same model. Second, as an adaptive cascade: clear cases
exit early after low-order checks, and higher-order guardrails are evaluated
only for ambiguous inputs, reducing overall monitoring costs. On two
large-scale safety datasets (WildGuardMix and BeaverTails), for 4 models with
up to 30B parameters, we show that TPCs compete with or outperform MLP-based
probe baselines of the same size, all the while being more interpretable than
their black-box counterparts. Our code is available at

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Evaluating the safety of frontier AI systems is an increasingly important
concern, helping to measure the capabilities of such models and identify risks
before deployment. However, it has been recognised that if AI agents are aware
that they are being evaluated, such agents may deliberately hide dangerous
capabilities or intentionally demonstrate suboptimal performance in
safety-related tasks in order to be released and to avoid being deactivated or
retrained. Such strategic deception - often known as "sandbagging" - threatens
to undermine the integrity of safety evaluations. For this reason, it is of
value to identify methods that enable us to distinguish behavioural patterns
that demonstrate a true lack of capability from behavioural patterns that are
consistent with sandbagging. In this paper, we develop a simple model of
strategic deception in sequential decision-making tasks, inspired by the
recently developed survival bandit framework. We demonstrate theoretically that
this problem induces sandbagging behaviour in optimal rational agents, and
construct a statistical test to distinguish between sandbagging and
incompetence from sequences of test scores. In simulation experiments, we
investigate the reliability of this test in allowing us to distinguish between
such behaviours in bandit models. This work aims to establish a potential
avenue for developing robust statistical procedures for use in the science of
frontier model evaluations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Wasserstein分布鲁棒性的框架，用于在最坏情况下认证群体公平性，提供在分布偏移下的稳定公平性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 群体公平性指标在重采样和分布偏移下变化剧烈，影响审计的可靠性。

Method: 使用Wasserstein分布鲁棒框架，在经验分布周围的合理测试分布球上认证最坏情况群体公平性，并开发了高效的DRUNE估计器。

Result: ε-WDF在标准基准和分类器上提供了在分布偏移下的稳定公平性评估，具有可行性、一致性和有限样本认证保证。

Conclusion: 该框架为超越观测数据的群体公平性审计和认证提供了原则性基础。

Abstract: Group-fairness metrics (e.g., equalized odds) can vary sharply across
resamples and are especially brittle under distribution shift, undermining
reliable audits. We propose a Wasserstein distributionally robust framework
that certifies worst-case group fairness over a ball of plausible test
distributions centered at the empirical law. Our formulation unifies common
group fairness notions via a generic conditional-probability functional and
defines $\varepsilon$-Wasserstein Distributional Fairness ($\varepsilon$-WDF)
as the audit target. Leveraging strong duality, we derive tractable
reformulations and an efficient estimator (DRUNE) for $\varepsilon$-WDF. We
prove feasibility and consistency and establish finite-sample certification
guarantees for auditing fairness, along with quantitative bounds under
smoothness and margin conditions. Across standard benchmarks and classifiers,
$\varepsilon$-WDF delivers stable fairness assessments under distribution
shift, providing a principled basis for auditing and certifying group fairness
beyond observational data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究很少探索DRO在个体公平性方面的应用，特别是在考虑因果结构和敏感属性的学习问题中，这限制了DRO在公平机器学习中的潜力。

Method: 首先从因果和个体公平性角度构建DRO问题，然后使用DRO双重公式进行转化，推导出近似最坏情况损失的闭式正则化器，并研究DRO与经典鲁棒优化的关系。

Result: 提出了消除min-max问题中max步骤的正则化方法，在未知因果结构情况下提供了有限样本误差界，确保高效和鲁棒的学习。

Conclusion: 该方法为在因果公平性约束下实现分布鲁棒优化提供了有效工具，特别是在处理敏感属性和未知因果结构时具有重要价值。

Abstract: In recent years, Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) has
garnered substantial interest for its efficacy in data-driven decision-making
under distributional uncertainty. However, limited research has explored the
application of DRO to address individual fairness concerns, particularly when
considering causal structures and sensitive attributes in learning problems. To
address this gap, we first formulate the DRO problem from causality and
individual fairness perspectives. We then present the DRO dual formulation as
an efficient tool to convert the DRO problem into a more tractable and
computationally efficient form. Next, we characterize the closed form of the
approximate worst-case loss quantity as a regularizer, eliminating the max-step
in the min-max DRO problem. We further estimate the regularizer in more general
cases and explore the relationship between DRO and classical robust
optimization. Finally, by removing the assumption of a known structural causal
model, we provide finite sample error bounds when designing DRO with empirical
distributions and estimated causal structures to ensure efficiency and robust
learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数生成模型依赖高斯去噪方法，但这在PDE和动力系统（如气候）的自回归预测任务中可能不是最有效的选择。需要寻找更适合物理系统模拟的生成建模方法。

Method: 使用随机插值法，直接学习当前状态和未来状态之间的随机过程，利用连续物理分布的接近性。通过调整采样来平衡确定性精度、谱一致性和概率校准。

Result: 随机插值法比基于高斯噪声传输的模型使用更少的采样步骤，产生更准确的预测。在不同物理领域和任务中的基准测试表明该方法具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 随机插值法为物理仿真提供了一个有竞争力的基准，并揭示了不同生成建模框架的能力。该方法能够通过调整采样来满足物理系统模拟的多个要求。

Abstract: Generative models have recently emerged as powerful surrogates for physical
systems, demonstrating increased accuracy, stability, and/or statistical
fidelity. Most approaches rely on iteratively denoising a Gaussian, a choice
that may not be the most effective for autoregressive prediction tasks in PDEs
and dynamical systems such as climate. In this work, we benchmark generative
models across diverse physical domains and tasks, and highlight the role of
stochastic interpolants. By directly learning a stochastic process between
current and future states, stochastic interpolants can leverage the proximity
of successive physical distributions. This allows for generative models that
can use fewer sampling steps and produce more accurate predictions than models
relying on transporting Gaussian noise. Our experiments suggest that generative
models need to balance deterministic accuracy, spectral consistency, and
probabilistic calibration, and that stochastic interpolants can potentially
fulfill these requirements by adjusting their sampling. This study establishes
stochastic interpolants as a competitive baseline for physical emulation and
gives insight into the abilities of different generative modeling frameworks.

Motivation: 在低数据量模仿学习场景中，依赖大规模预训练或高容量架构的方法难以应用，需要高效利用有限专家演示数据的方法。

Method: 将模仿学习建模为最优传输问题，通过对抗训练求解，无需预训练或专用架构，内置不确定性估计，实现简单易调。

Result: 在包括高维Humanoid任务在内的挑战性连续控制任务中，即使在仅有20个转换的超低数据量下，NGT仍能取得强劲性能。

Conclusion: NGT是一种简单有效、无需预训练的模仿学习方法，在低数据量场景下表现出色，易于实现和调优。

Abstract: We consider imitation learning in the low-data regime, where only a limited
number of expert demonstrations are available. In this setting, methods that
rely on large-scale pretraining or high-capacity architectures can be difficult
to apply, and efficiency with respect to demonstration data becomes critical.
We introduce Noise-Guided Transport (NGT), a lightweight off-policy method that
casts imitation as an optimal transport problem solved via adversarial
training. NGT requires no pretraining or specialized architectures,
incorporates uncertainty estimation by design, and is easy to implement and
tune. Despite its simplicity, NGT achieves strong performance on challenging
continuous control tasks, including high-dimensional Humanoid tasks, under
ultra-low data regimes with as few as 20 transitions. Code is publicly

Motivation: 自动性能调优框架中的优化算法超参数几乎从未被调优过，但其对性能的潜在影响尚未被研究，这限制了调优器的效率提升。

Method: 提出了一种通用的超参数调优方法，包括跨搜索空间的稳健统计评估方法、FAIR数据集和软件发布，以及通过回放历史调优数据降低成本的仿真模式。

Result: 即使有限的超参数调优也能将自动调优器性能平均提升94.8%，使用元策略优化超参数可平均提升204.7%，成本降低两个数量级。

Conclusion: 超参数调优是推进自动调优研究和实践的有力技术，但此前一直被忽视，该方法展示了其巨大的性能提升潜力。

Abstract: Automatic performance tuning (auto-tuning) is widely used to optimize
performance-critical applications across many scientific domains by finding the
best program variant among many choices. Efficient optimization algorithms are
crucial for navigating the vast and complex search spaces in auto-tuning. As is
well known in the context of machine learning and similar fields,
hyperparameters critically shape optimization algorithm efficiency. Yet for
auto-tuning frameworks, these hyperparameters are almost never tuned, and their
potential performance impact has not been studied.
  We present a novel method for general hyperparameter tuning of optimization
algorithms for auto-tuning, thus "tuning the tuner". In particular, we propose
a robust statistical method for evaluating hyperparameter performance across
search spaces, publish a FAIR data set and software for reproducibility, and
present a simulation mode that replays previously recorded tuning data,
lowering the costs of hyperparameter tuning by two orders of magnitude. We show
that even limited hyperparameter tuning can improve auto-tuner performance by
94.8% on average, and establish that the hyperparameters themselves can be
optimized efficiently with meta-strategies (with an average improvement of
204.7%), demonstrating the often overlooked hyperparameter tuning as a powerful
technique for advancing auto-tuning research and practice.

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models for EEG signals offer a promising path to
generalizable brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, but they often
suffer from misalignment between pretraining objectives and downstream tasks,
as well as significant cross-subject distribution shifts. This paper addresses
these challenges by introducing a two-stage alignment strategy that bridges the
gap between generic pretraining and specific EEG decoding tasks. First, we
propose NeuroTTT: a domain-specific self-supervised fine-tuning paradigm that
augments the foundation model with task-relevant self-supervised objectives,
aligning latent representations to important spectral, spatial, and temporal
EEG features without requiring additional labeled data. Second, we incorporate
test-time training (TTT) at inference, we perform (i) self-supervised test-time
training on individual unlabeled test samples and (ii) prediction entropy
minimization (Tent), which updates only normalization statistics to continually
calibrate the model to each new input on the fly. Our approach, which, to our
knowledge, is the first to unify domain-tuned self-supervision with test-time
training in large-scale EEG foundation models, yields substantially improved
robustness and accuracy across diverse BCI tasks (imagined speech, stress
detection, motor imagery). Using CBraMod and LaBraM as backbones, our method
pushes their performance to a markedly higher level. Results on three diverse
tasks demonstrate that the proposed alignment strategy achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming conventional fine-tuning and
adaptation methods. Our code is available at

Motivation: 标准解码方法在满足复杂指令和生成事实准确文本方面存在不足，现有控制技术又常常降低输出质量，需要一种更有效的方法来增强LLM的可靠性。

Method: AGD从高概率输出候选词中选择对用户定义感兴趣区域(ROI)贡献最大的词，ROI可灵活定义在模型输入或内部组件的不同部分，还提出了基于熵的自适应变体以减少计算开销。

Result: 在指令遵循方面，AGD显著提高了成功率(如Llama 3.1从66.0%提升到79.1%)；在知识密集型任务中，减少了幻觉并提高了事实准确性；自适应变体缓解了质量下降问题。

Conclusion: AGD是一种多功能、更可解释且有效的方法，能够增强现代LLM的可靠性。

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow complex instructions
and generate factually accurate text is critical for their real-world
application. However, standard decoding methods often fail to robustly satisfy
these requirements, while existing control techniques frequently degrade
general output quality. In this work, we introduce Attribution-Guided Decoding
(AGD), an interpretability-based decoding strategy. Instead of directly
manipulating model activations, AGD considers a set of high-probability output
token candidates and selects the one that exhibits the highest attribution to a
user-defined Region of Interest (ROI). This ROI can be flexibly defined over
different parts of the model's input or internal components, allowing AGD to
steer generation towards various desirable behaviors. We demonstrate AGD's
efficacy across three challenging domains. For instruction following, we show
that AGD significantly boosts adherence (e.g., improving the overall success
rate on Llama 3.1 from 66.0% to 79.1%). For knowledge-intensive tasks, we show
that guiding generation towards usage of internal knowledge components or
contextual sources can reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy in
both closed-book and open-book settings. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive,
entropy-based variant of AGD that mitigates quality degradation and reduces
computational overhead by applying guidance only when the model is uncertain.
Our work presents a versatile, more interpretable, and effective method for
enhancing the reliability of modern LLMs.

Abstract: In certain real-world optimization scenarios, practitioners are not
interested in solving multiple problems but rather in finding the best solution
to a single, specific problem. When the computational budget is large relative
to the cost of evaluating a candidate solution, multiple heuristic alternatives
can be tried to solve the same given problem, each possibly with a different
algorithm, parameter configuration, initialization, or stopping criterion. The
sequential selection of which alternative to try next is crucial for
efficiently identifying the one that provides the best possible solution across
multiple attempts. Despite the relevance of this problem in practice, it has
not yet been the exclusive focus of any existing review. Several sequential
alternative selection strategies have been proposed in different research
topics, but they have not been comprehensively and systematically unified under
a common perspective.
  This work presents a focused review of single-problem multi-attempt heuristic
optimization. It brings together suitable strategies to this problem that have
been studied separately through algorithm selection, parameter tuning,
multi-start and resource allocation. These strategies are explained using a
unified terminology within a common framework, which supports the development
of a taxonomy for systematically organizing and classifying them.

Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法样本效率低，需要大量黑盒模型评估，成本高且不实用。

Result: ACE在评估效率上优于现有方法，同时能有效识别最小且可行的特征变化。

Conclusion: ACE算法显著提高了反事实解释的样本效率，为受限模型访问场景提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CFEs) interpret machine learning models by
identifying the smallest change to input features needed to change the model's
prediction to a desired output. For classification tasks, CFEs determine how
close a given sample is to the decision boundary of a trained classifier.
Existing methods are often sample-inefficient, requiring numerous evaluations
of a black-box model -- an approach that is both costly and impractical when
access to the model is limited. We propose Adaptive sampling for Counterfactual
Explanations (ACE), a sample-efficient algorithm combining Bayesian estimation
and stochastic optimization to approximate the decision boundary with fewer
queries. By prioritizing informative points, ACE minimizes evaluations while
generating accurate and feasible CFEs. Extensive empirical results show that
ACE achieves superior evaluation efficiency compared to state-of-the-art
methods, while maintaining effectiveness in identifying minimal and actionable
changes.

Conclusion: 广义信息瓶颈框架解决了原始IB的局限性，提供了更实用的理论工具，同时保持与现有IB理论的兼容性。

Abstract: The Information Bottleneck (IB) principle offers a compelling theoretical
framework to understand how neural networks (NNs) learn. However, its practical
utility has been constrained by unresolved theoretical ambiguities and
significant challenges in accurate estimation. In this paper, we present a
\textit{Generalized Information Bottleneck (GIB)} framework that reformulates
the original IB principle through the lens of synergy, i.e., the information
obtainable only through joint processing of features. We provide theoretical
and empirical evidence demonstrating that synergistic functions achieve
superior generalization compared to their non-synergistic counterparts.
Building on these foundations we re-formulate the IB using a computable
definition of synergy based on the average interaction information (II) of each
feature with those remaining. We demonstrate that the original IB objective is
upper bounded by our GIB in the case of perfect estimation, ensuring
compatibility with existing IB theory while addressing its limitations. Our
experimental results demonstrate that GIB consistently exhibits compression
phases across a wide range of architectures (including those with \textit{ReLU}
activations where the standard IB fails), while yielding interpretable dynamics
in both CNNs and Transformers and aligning more closely with our understanding

*Yuki Takezawa,Anastasia Koloskova,Xiaowen Jiang,Sebastian U. Stich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了Muon优化方法在联邦学习中的应用，提出了FedMuon算法来解决直接使用Muon作为本地优化器不收敛的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon作为一种基于线性最小化预言机(LMO)的新优化方法，在神经网络训练中比Adam等自适应方法更快，但如何在联邦学习中有效利用Muon尚未被探索。

Method: 提出了FedMuon算法，通过缓解LMO作为有偏算子导致的不收敛问题，并分析了近似求解LMO对收敛速率的影响。

Result: 实验证明FedMuon能够超越现有的最先进联邦学习方法，且发现FedMuon在任何数量的Newton-Schulz迭代下都能收敛，且LMO求解越准确收敛越快。

Conclusion: FedMuon成功将Muon优化方法应用于联邦学习，解决了收敛性问题，并在性能上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recently, a new optimization method based on the linear minimization oracle
(LMO), called Muon, has been attracting increasing attention since it can train
neural networks faster than existing adaptive optimization methods, such as
Adam. In this paper, we study how Muon can be utilized in federated learning.
We first show that straightforwardly using Muon as the local optimizer of
FedAvg does not converge to the stationary point since the LMO is a biased
operator. We then propose FedMuon which can mitigate this issue. We also
analyze how solving the LMO approximately affects the convergence rate and find
that, surprisingly, FedMuon can converge for any number of Newton-Schulz
iterations, while it can converge faster as we solve the LMO more accurately.
Through experiments, we demonstrated that FedMuon can outperform the
state-of-the-art federated learning methods.

*Xue Yan,Zijing Ou,Mengyue Yang,Yan Song,Haifeng Zhang,Yingzhen Li,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个记忆驱动的自改进框架，将LLM的通用先验知识与特定领域的紧凑记忆相结合，通过记忆和LLM先验的相互增强来提升序列决策任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在序列决策任务中虽然具有广泛知识，但针对特定任务时，由于任务相关数据有限，难以有效适应。需要将通用知识与领域特定经验结合。

Method: 使用记忆模块存储过去交互和Q值，捕获决策相关知识；通过记忆精炼LLM先验，生成更高奖励轨迹；形成记忆和LLM先验相互增强的自改进循环。

Result: 在ALFWorld实验中，记忆驱动方法显著优于传统RL和基于LLM的基线方法，在分布内任务上性能提升超过40%，在未见任务上泛化能力提升超过75%。

Conclusion: 记忆驱动的自改进框架有效结合了LLM的通用知识和领域特定经验，显著提升了序列决策任务的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as effective action policies for
sequential decision-making (SDM) tasks due to their extensive prior knowledge.
However, this broad yet general knowledge is often insufficient for specific
decision-making tasks with limited task-related data, making it challenging to
efficiently adapt LLMs to specific SDM tasks. To address this challenge, we
propose a memory-driven self-improvement framework that combines LLM general
prior knowledge with a compact memory of domain-specific experiences. Memory
retains past interactions and associated Q-values, thereby capturing
decision-relevant knowledge that facilitates accurate value estimation and
informs the LLM prior refinement. The refined LLM prior, in turn, generates
higher-reward trajectories that further enrich memory, forming a natural
self-improvement framework where memory and LLM prior mutually reinforce each
other. Experiments show that our memory-driven approach significantly
outperforms both traditional RL and LLM-based baselines, e.g., improving
performance by over 40\% on in-distribution tasks and over 75\% when
generalized to unseen tasks in ALFWorld.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决急诊和群体伤亡事件分诊研究中缺乏开放、可复现基准的问题，使分诊预测研究更易于访问和复现。

Method: 使用LLM辅助构建急诊分诊基准数据集，包括数据预处理、特征协调和模式对齐，定义两种场景设置，并提供基线模型和SHAP可解释性分析。

Result: 成功创建了开放的分诊基准数据集，展示了不同场景下的预测差距，并识别了对分诊最关键的特征。

Conclusion: 这些贡献使分诊预测研究更具可复现性和可访问性，是临床AI中数据集民主化的重要一步。

Abstract: Research on emergency and mass casualty incident (MCI) triage has been
limited by the absence of openly usable, reproducible benchmarks. Yet these
scenarios demand rapid identification of the patients most in need, where
accurate deterioration prediction can guide timely interventions. While the
MIMIC-IV-ED database is openly available to credentialed researchers,
transforming it into a triage-focused benchmark requires extensive
preprocessing, feature harmonization, and schema alignment -- barriers that
restrict accessibility to only highly technical users.
  We address these gaps by first introducing an open, LLM-assisted emergency
triage benchmark for deterioration prediction (ICU transfer, in-hospital
mortality). The benchmark then defines two regimes: (i) a hospital-rich setting
with vitals, labs, notes, chief complaints, and structured observations, and
(ii) an MCI-like field simulation limited to vitals, observations, and notes.
Large language models (LLMs) contributed directly to dataset construction by
(i) harmonizing noisy fields such as AVPU and breathing devices, (ii)
prioritizing clinically relevant vitals and labs, and (iii) guiding schema
alignment and efficient merging of disparate tables.
  We further provide baseline models and SHAP-based interpretability analyses,
illustrating predictive gaps between regimes and the features most critical for
triage. Together, these contributions make triage prediction research more
reproducible and accessible -- a step toward dataset democratization in
clinical AI.

TL;DR: LLMs通过纯文本预训练意外地发展出丰富的视觉先验知识，这些先验知识包含可分离的感知和推理先验，具有不同的扩展趋势和来源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示LLMs在纯文本预训练中如何发展视觉先验知识，以及这些知识如何影响视觉任务的性能，为下一代多模态LLMs的开发提供指导。

Method: 通过超过100个控制实验（消耗50万GPU小时），涵盖完整的MLLM构建流程，分析不同数据类别和混合对视觉先验的影响。

Result: 发现推理先验主要由推理中心数据（如代码、数学、学术文本）发展而来，可迁移到视觉推理；感知先验则更广泛地来自语料库，对视觉编码器和视觉指令调优数据更敏感。

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于数据中心的预训练方法，用于有意识地培养语言预训练中的视觉先验，为下一代多模态LLMs铺平道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite being trained on text alone,
surprisingly develop rich visual priors. These priors allow latent visual
capabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of
multimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having
seen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the
implicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language
pre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with
unique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual
reasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on
reasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively.
This reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and
universally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior
emerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more
sensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In
parallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its
performance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a
data-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T
token scale pre-training. Our findings are grounded in over 100 controlled
experiments consuming 500,000 GPU-hours, spanning the full MLLM construction
pipeline-from LLM pre-training to visual alignment and supervised multimodal
fine-tuning-across five model scales, a wide range of data categories and
mixtures, and multiple adaptation setups. Along with our main findings, we
propose and investigate several hypotheses, and introduce the Multi-Level
Existence Bench (MLE-Bench). Together, this work provides a new way of
deliberately cultivating visual priors from language pre-training, paving the
way for the next generation of multimodal LLMs.

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger bridge problem is concerned with finding a stochastic
dynamical system bridging two marginal distributions that minimises a certain
transportation cost. This problem, which represents a generalisation of optimal
transport to the stochastic case, has received attention due to its connections
to diffusion models and flow matching, as well as its applications in the
natural sciences. However, all existing algorithms allow to infer such dynamics
only for cases where samples from both distributions are available. In this
paper, we propose the first general method for modelling Schr\"odinger bridges
when one (or both) distributions are given by their unnormalised densities,
with no access to data samples. Our algorithm relies on a generalisation of the
iterative proportional fitting (IPF) procedure to the data-free case, inspired
by recent developments in off-policy reinforcement learning for training of
diffusion samplers. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed data-to-energy
IPF on synthetic problems, finding that it can successfully learn transports
between multimodal distributions. As a secondary consequence of our
reinforcement learning formulation, which assumes a fixed time discretisation
scheme for the dynamics, we find that existing data-to-data Schr\"odinger
bridge algorithms can be substantially improved by learning the diffusion
coefficient of the dynamics. Finally, we apply the newly developed algorithm to
the problem of sampling posterior distributions in latent spaces of generative
models, thus creating a data-free image-to-image translation method. Code:

Motivation: 开发一个能够处理片段化SMILES表示的统一生成模型，支持从早期命中发现到多目标先导化合物优化的整个药物发现流程。

Method: 使用离散流生成模型学习将均匀源分布转换为数据分布，采用结合遗传算法和近端属性优化微调策略的混合方案进行属性优化。

Result: 在从头生成方面实现了比先前片段模型更强的质量-多样性帕累托前沿，在实用分子优化基准测试中创造了新的最先进水平，在先导化合物优化中获得了更高的对接分数。

Conclusion: InVirtuoGen为药物发现建立了一个多功能的生成基础，从早期命中发现到多目标先导化合物优化，并通过发布预训练检查点和代码促进开放科学。

Abstract: We introduce InVirtuoGen, a discrete flow generative model for fragmented
SMILES for de novo and fragment-constrained generation, and
target-property/lead optimization of small molecules. The model learns to
transform a uniform source over all possible tokens into the data distribution.
Unlike masked models, its training loss accounts for predictions on all
sequence positions at every denoising step, shifting the generation paradigm
from completion to refinement, and decoupling the number of sampling steps from
the sequence length. For \textit{de novo} generation, InVirtuoGen achieves a
stronger quality-diversity pareto frontier than prior fragment-based models and
competitive performance on fragment-constrained tasks. For property and lead
optimization, we propose a hybrid scheme that combines a genetic algorithm with
a Proximal Property Optimization fine-tuning strategy adapted to discrete
flows. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the Practical Molecular
Optimization benchmark, measured by top-10 AUC across tasks, and yields higher
docking scores in lead optimization than previous baselines. InVirtuoGen thus
establishes a versatile generative foundation for drug discovery, from early
hit finding to multi-objective lead optimization. We further contribute to open
science by releasing pretrained checkpoints and code, making our results fully
reproducible\footnote{https://github.com/invirtuolabs/InVirtuoGen_results}.

TL;DR: 梯度上升优化方法在机器遗忘任务中经常失败，原因是遗忘数据和保留数据之间存在统计依赖性，即使只是简单的相关性也会导致这些方法无法有效执行遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战普遍认为梯度上升优化方法能够有效执行机器遗忘的观点，揭示遗忘集和保留集之间的统计依赖性如何破坏这些方法的有效性。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析，包括逻辑回归案例研究和玩具示例，展示梯度下降-上升迭代如何因数据集间依赖而偏离理想重训练模型。

Result: 梯度上升方法不仅无法收敛到理想的重训练模型，反而可能收敛到比原始模型更差的解，使遗忘过程适得其反。

Conclusion: 遗忘集和保留集之间的统计依赖性（即使是相关性）足以导致基于上升的遗忘方法失败，这一发现在复杂神经网络实验中得到验证。

Abstract: Contrary to common belief, we show that gradient ascent-based unconstrained
optimization methods frequently fail to perform machine unlearning, a
phenomenon we attribute to the inherent statistical dependence between the
forget and retain data sets. This dependence, which can manifest itself even as
simple correlations, undermines the misconception that these sets can be
independently manipulated during unlearning. We provide empirical and
theoretical evidence showing these methods often fail precisely due to this
overlooked relationship. For random forget sets, this dependence means that
degrading forget set metrics (which, for a retrained model, should mirror test
set metrics) inevitably harms overall test performance. Going beyond random
sets, we consider logistic regression as an instructive example where a
critical failure mode emerges: inter-set dependence causes gradient
descent-ascent iterations to progressively diverge from the ideal retrained
model. Strikingly, these methods can converge to solutions that are not only
far from the retrained ideal but are potentially even further from it than the
original model itself, rendering the unlearning process actively detrimental. A
toy example further illustrates how this dependence can trap models in inferior
local minima, inescapable via finetuning. Our findings highlight that the
presence of such statistical dependencies, even when manifest only as
correlations, can be sufficient for ascent-based unlearning to fail. Our
theoretical insights are corroborated by experiments on complex neural
networks, demonstrating that these methods do not perform as expected in
practice due to this unaddressed statistical interplay.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了AdaBlock-dLLM，一种用于扩散大语言模型的训练免费、即插即用的调度器，通过自适应调整块大小来优化半自回归解码，解决了固定块大小方法的两个基本限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的半自回归解码方法使用固定块大小存在两个根本问题：1）后期解码开销，即高置信度令牌在当前块外被不必要地延迟；2）过早解码错误，即低置信度令牌在当前块内过早提交导致错误令牌。

Method: 通过去噪过程中的置信度动态统计分析，识别出波动带区域，该区域编码了局部语义结构。基于此开发了AdaBlock-dLLM调度器，在运行时自适应调整块大小以对齐语义边界。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，AdaBlock-dLLM在相同吞吐量预算下实现了高达5.3%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 除了推理时优化，作者希望这种语义感知的自适应调度方法和基于置信度的分析能够启发未来dLLMs的训练策略。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) are gaining attention for their
inherent capacity for parallel decoding, offering a compelling alternative to
autoregressive LLMs. Among various decoding strategies, blockwise
semi-autoregressive (semi-AR) approaches are widely adopted due to their
natural support for KV caching and their favorable accuracy-speed trade-off.
However, this paper identifies two fundamental limitations in the conventional
semi-AR decoding approach that applies a fixed block size: i) late decoding
overhead, where the unmasking of high-confidence tokens outside the current
block is unnecessarily delayed, and ii) premature decoding error, where
low-confidence tokens inside the current block are committed too early, leading
to incorrect tokens. This paper presents the first systematic investigation
challenging the fixed block size assumption in semi-AR decoding. Through a
statistical analysis of confidence dynamics during the denoising process, we
identify a volatility band (VB) region during dLLM decoding, which encodes
local semantic structure and can be used to guide adaptive block sizing.
Leveraging these insights, we introduce AdaBlock-dLLM, a training-free,
plug-and-play scheduler that adaptively aligns block boundaries with semantic
steps by adjusting block size during runtime. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks show that AdaBlock-dLLM achieves up to 5.3% accuracy
improvement under the same throughput budget. Beyond inference-time
optimization, we hope our semantics-aware adaptive scheduling approach and
confidence-based analysis will inspire future training strategies for dLLMs.

TL;DR: ACT将决策树方法扩展到非结构化文本数据，通过自然语言问题作为分裂点，结合LLM反馈来构建透明可解释的分类系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险场景中，AI系统需要产生透明、可解释和可审计的决策，但传统决策树无法处理非结构化文本数据，而LLM的提示策略缺乏可信赖的行为保证。

Method: 将决策树每个分裂点表示为自然语言问题，通过基于不纯度的评估和TextGrad的LLM反馈来优化问题表述。

Result: 在文本基准测试中，ACT达到或超过基于提示的基线方法，同时产生透明可解释的决策路径。

Conclusion: ACT成功将决策树的透明性优势扩展到非结构化文本数据，为高风险应用提供了可信赖的AI决策系统。

Abstract: When used in high-stakes settings, AI systems are expected to produce
decisions that are transparent, interpretable, and auditable, a requirement
increasingly expected by regulations. Decision trees such as CART provide clear
and verifiable rules, but they are restricted to structured tabular data and
cannot operate directly on unstructured inputs such as text. In practice, large
language models (LLMs) are widely used for such data, yet prompting strategies
such as chain-of-thought or prompt optimization still rely on free-form
reasoning, limiting their ability to ensure trustworthy behaviors. We present
the Agentic Classification Tree (ACT), which extends decision-tree methodology
to unstructured inputs by formulating each split as a natural-language
question, refined through impurity-based evaluation and LLM feedback via
TextGrad. Experiments on text benchmarks show that ACT matches or surpasses
prompting-based baselines while producing transparent and interpretable
decision paths.

TL;DR: 扩展Robbins-Siegmund定理，使其适用于零阶项仅平方可和而非可和的情况，为强化学习中的随机逼近算法提供收敛性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始Robbins-Siegmund定理要求零阶项可和，但在许多重要强化学习应用中这一条件无法满足，限制了其应用范围。

Method: 引入对随机过程增量的新颖温和假设，结合平方可和条件，实现几乎必然收敛到有界集。

Result: 获得了几乎必然收敛速率、高概率集中界和L^p收敛速率，并首次应用于Q-learning线性函数逼近。

Conclusion: 扩展的Robbins-Siegmund定理为随机逼近和强化学习算法提供了更广泛的收敛性分析工具，特别适用于零阶项不可和但平方可和的情况。

Abstract: The Robbins-Siegmund theorem establishes the convergence of stochastic
processes that are almost supermartingales and is foundational for analyzing a
wide range of stochastic iterative algorithms in stochastic approximation and
reinforcement learning (RL). However, its original form has a significant
limitation as it requires the zero-order term to be summable. In many important
RL applications, this summable condition, however, cannot be met. This
limitation motivates us to extend the Robbins-Siegmund theorem for almost
supermartingales where the zero-order term is not summable but only square
summable. Particularly, we introduce a novel and mild assumption on the
increments of the stochastic processes. This together with the square summable
condition enables an almost sure convergence to a bounded set. Additionally, we
further provide almost sure convergence rates, high probability concentration
bounds, and $L^p$ convergence rates. We then apply the new results in
stochastic approximation and RL. Notably, we obtain the first almost sure
convergence rate, the first high probability concentration bound, and the first
$L^p$ convergence rate for $Q$-learning with linear function approximation.

Motivation: 现有时间序列预测基准存在领域覆盖窄、忽略协变量任务、缺乏统计严谨性、集成困难等问题，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 构建包含100个任务的fev-bench数据集，开发fev库支持模型评估，使用自助法置信区间进行统计严谨的聚合分析。

Conclusion: fev-bench为时间序列预测提供了更全面和统计严谨的评估基准，识别了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Benchmark quality is critical for meaningful evaluation and sustained
progress in time series forecasting, particularly given the recent rise of
pretrained models. Existing benchmarks often have narrow domain coverage or
overlook important real-world settings, such as tasks with covariates.
Additionally, their aggregation procedures often lack statistical rigor, making
it unclear whether observed performance differences reflect true improvements
or random variation. Many benchmarks also fail to provide infrastructure for
consistent evaluation or are too rigid to integrate into existing pipelines. To
address these gaps, we propose fev-bench, a benchmark comprising 100
forecasting tasks across seven domains, including 46 tasks with covariates.
Supporting the benchmark, we introduce fev, a lightweight Python library for
benchmarking forecasting models that emphasizes reproducibility and seamless
integration with existing workflows. Usingfev, fev-bench employs principled
aggregation methods with bootstrapped confidence intervals to report model
performance along two complementary dimensions: win rates and skill scores. We
report results on fev-bench for various pretrained, statistical and baseline
models, and identify promising directions for future research.

TL;DR: 提出DiVeQ和SF-DiVeQ两种向量量化方法，通过模拟量化失真作为误差向量，实现前向硬分配和反向梯度流动，无需辅助损失或温度调度即可端到端训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统向量量化在深度模型中使用广泛，但其硬分配会阻断梯度传播，阻碍端到端训练。

Method: DiVeQ将量化视为添加模拟量化失真的误差向量，保持前向硬分配同时允许梯度流动；SF-DiVeQ进一步将分配扩展到码字连线构成的曲线上，减少量化误差并充分利用码本。

Result: 在VQ-VAE压缩和VQGAN生成任务上，相比其他量化方法，在多个数据集上提升了重建质量和样本质量。

Conclusion: DiVeQ和SF-DiVeQ是有效的向量量化方法，能够实现端到端训练，在压缩和生成任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Vector quantization is common in deep models, yet its hard assignments block
gradients and hinder end-to-end training. We propose DiVeQ, which treats
quantization as adding an error vector that mimics the quantization distortion,
keeping the forward pass hard while letting gradients flow. We also present a
space-filling variant (SF-DiVeQ) that assigns to a curve constructed by the
lines connecting codewords, resulting in less quantization error and full
codebook usage. Both methods train end-to-end without requiring auxiliary
losses or temperature schedules. On VQ-VAE compression and VQGAN generation
across various data sets, they improve reconstruction and sample quality over
alternative quantization approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出EAT（Entropy After </Think>）信号来检测和防止大型推理模型的过度思考问题，通过监控推理过程中的熵变化实现自适应计算分配，减少13-21%的token使用而不影响准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在长链推理中表现出改进性能，但存在过度思考问题，即在达到正确答案后仍继续修正，造成token浪费。需要找到方法来检测和防止这种低效行为。

Method: 提出EAT信号方法：在推理过程中添加停止思考token（</think>），监控后续token的熵变化轨迹。当Pass@1达到平台期时，熵会下降并稳定，通过指数移动平均的方差阈值实现实用的停止规则。

Result: 在MATH500和AIME2025数据集上，EAT方法减少token使用量13-21%，同时保持准确率不变。即使在无法访问推理模型logits的黑盒设置中，使用代理模型计算EAT仍然有效。

Conclusion: EAT提供了一种简单且廉价的方法来监控推理过程，实现自适应计算分配，显著提高推理效率，为大型语言模型的推理优化提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large reasoning models show improved performance with longer chains of
thought. However, recent work has highlighted (qualitatively) their tendency to
overthink, continuing to revise answers even after reaching the correct
solution. We quantitatively confirm this inefficiency by tracking Pass@1 for
answers averaged over a large number of rollouts and find that the model often
begins to always produce the correct answer early in the reasoning, making
extra reasoning a waste of tokens. To detect and prevent overthinking, we
propose a simple and inexpensive novel signal -- Entropy After </Think> (EAT)
-- for monitoring and deciding whether to exit reasoning early. By appending a
stop thinking token (</think>) and monitoring the entropy of the following
token as the model reasons, we obtain a trajectory that decreases and
stabilizes when Pass@1 plateaus; thresholding its variance under an exponential
moving average yields a practical stopping rule. Importantly, our approach
enables adaptively allocating compute based on the EAT trajectory, allowing us
to spend compute in a more efficient way compared with fixing the token budget
for all questions. Empirically, on MATH500 and AIME2025, EAT reduces token
usage by 13 - 21% without harming accuracy, and it remains effective in black
box settings where logits from the reasoning model are not accessible, and EAT
is computed with proxy models.

### [393] [TAP: Two-Stage Adaptive Personalization of Multi-task and Multi-Modal Foundation Models in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26524)
*Seohyun Lee,Wenzhi Fang,Dong-Jun Han,Seyyedali Hosseinalipour,Christopher G. Brinton*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了TAP（两阶段自适应个性化）方法，通过客户端-服务器模型架构不匹配和知识蒸馏来解决多任务多模态联邦学习中的个性化问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习产生的最终模型不一定适合每个客户端的需求，特别是在数据、任务和模态都存在异构性的场景下，缺乏对基础模型进行微调和个性化的有效方法

Method: TAP方法包含两个阶段：(i) 利用客户端与服务器模型架构不匹配来选择性进行替换操作，以有益于客户端的本地任务；(ii) 在联邦学习后进行知识蒸馏，在不影响个性化的前提下捕获有益的一般知识

Result: 通过大量实验验证了所提算法在多种数据集和任务上的有效性，优于多个基线方法

Conclusion: TAP方法能够有效解决多任务多模态联邦学习中的个性化问题，同时提供了服务器模型在模态-任务对架构下的收敛性分析

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), despite demonstrating impressive capabilities in the
training of multiple models in a decentralized manner, has been shown to
produce a final model not necessarily well-suited to the needs of each client.
While extensive work has been conducted on how to create tailored personalized
models, called Personalized Federated Learning (PFL), less attention has been
given to personalization via fine-tuning of foundation models with multi-task
and multi-modal properties. Moreover, there exists a lack of understanding in
the literature on how to fine-tune and personalize such models in a setting
that is heterogeneous across clients not only in data, but also in tasks and
modalities. To address this gap in the literature, we propose TAP (Two-Stage
Adaptive Personalization), which (i) leverages mismatched model architectures
between the clients and server to selectively conduct replacement operations
when it benefits a client's local tasks and (ii) engages in post-FL knowledge
distillation for capturing beneficial general knowledge without compromising
personalization. We also introduce the first convergence analysis of the server
model under its modality-task pair architecture, and demonstrate that as the
number of modality-task pairs increases, its ability to cater to all tasks
suffers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed algorithm across a variety of datasets and tasks in comparison to a
multitude of baselines. Implementation code is publicly available at
https://github.com/lee3296/TAP.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于监督机器学习的数据驱动方法，用于改造电力系统中的负荷减载决策系统，以防御不稳定性攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着关键基础设施日益复杂和依赖加深，电网成为复杂网络攻击的诱人目标，特别是缺乏足够防护措施的不稳定性攻击。

Method: 使用监督机器学习模型，结合改进的Prony分析(MPA)方法检测不稳定性攻击，并在IEEE 14总线系统上进行概念验证。

Result: 证明MPA是检测不稳定性攻击并触发防御机制的有效方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为电力系统提供了一种经济有效的不稳定性攻击防御方案。

Abstract: Every year critical infrastructure becomes more complex and we grow to rely
on it more and more. With this reliance, it becomes an attractive target for
cyberattacks from sophisticated actors, with one of the most attractive targets
being the power grid. One class of attacks, instability attacks, is a newer
type of attack that has relatively few protections developed. We present a cost
effective, data-driven approach to training a supervised machine learning model
to retrofit load shedding decision systems in power grids with the capacity to
defend against instability attacks. We show a proof of concept on the IEEE 14
Bus System using the Achilles Heel Technologies Power Grid Analyzer, and show
through an implementation of modified Prony analysis (MPA) that MPA is a viable
method for detecting instability attacks and triggering defense mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种可解释性方法来理解神经网络如何根据训练后的参数来衡量数据点之间的相似性，为模型行为提供洞察。

Method: 使用低损失保持参数扰动的分布计算每样本损失的协方差矩阵，构建损失核来衡量数据点相似性。

Result: 在合成多任务问题上验证了方法有效性，在Inception-v1上应用显示核结构与WordNet语义层次对齐。

Conclusion: 损失核是一个实用的可解释性和数据归因工具，能够揭示神经网络对数据相似性的内在理解。

Abstract: We introduce the loss kernel, an interpretability method for measuring
similarity between data points according to a trained neural network. The
kernel is the covariance matrix of per-sample losses computed under a
distribution of low-loss-preserving parameter perturbations. We first validate
our method on a synthetic multitask problem, showing it separates inputs by
task as predicted by theory. We then apply this kernel to Inception-v1 to
visualize the structure of ImageNet, and we show that the kernel's structure
aligns with the WordNet semantic hierarchy. This establishes the loss kernel as
a practical tool for interpretability and data attribution.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TASP是一种针对长上下文LLM的拓扑感知序列并行方法，通过拓扑分解和原语分解充分利用现代加速器的通信能力，相比Ring Attention实现了最高3.58倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Ring Attention在长上下文LLM中由于使用Ring AllGather通信原语导致的低通信效率问题，该原语与现代加速器的AlltoAll拓扑不匹配。

Method: 基于哈密顿分解理论，将现代加速器拓扑分解为多个正交环形数据路径，同时将Ring AllGather原语分解为相同数量的并发环形数据传输，实现拓扑感知的序列并行。

Result: 在单节点和多节点NVIDIA H100系统以及单节点AMD MI300X系统上的实验表明，TASP比Ring Attention及其变体Zigzag-Ring Attention实现了更高的通信效率，最高加速比达到3.58倍。

Conclusion: TASP通过拓扑分解和原语分解有效利用了现代加速器的通信能力，为长上下文LLM提供了高效的序列并行解决方案。

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs) face constraints due to the
quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. The mainstream sequence
parallelism (SP) method, Ring Attention, attempts to solve this by distributing
the query into multiple query chunks across accelerators and enable each Q
tensor to access all KV tensors from other accelerators via the Ring AllGather
communication primitive. However, it exhibits low communication efficiency,
restricting its practical applicability. This inefficiency stems from the
mismatch between the Ring AllGather communication primitive it adopts and the
AlltoAll topology of modern accelerators. A Ring AllGather primitive is
composed of iterations of ring-styled data transfer, which can only utilize a
very limited fraction of an AlltoAll topology.
  Inspired by the Hamiltonian decomposition of complete directed graphs, we
identify that modern accelerator topology can be decomposed into multiple
orthogonal ring datapaths which can concurrently transfer data without
interference. Based on this, we further observe that the Ring AllGather
primitive can also be decomposed into the same number of concurrent ring-styled
data transfer at every iteration. Based on these insights, we propose TASP, a
topology-aware SP method for long-context LLMs that fully utilizes the
communication capacity of modern accelerators via topology decomposition and
primitive decomposition. Experimental results on both single-node and
multi-node NVIDIA H100 systems and a single-node AMD MI300X system demonstrate
that TASP achieves higher communication efficiency than Ring Attention on these
modern accelerator topologies and achieves up to 3.58 speedup than Ring
Attention and its variant Zigzag-Ring Attention. The code is available at
https://github.com/infinigence/HamiltonAttention.

Conclusion: 局部贝叶斯影响函数为深度神经网络提供了一种可扩展的影响分析方法，克服了经典方法的局限性。

Abstract: Classical influence functions face significant challenges when applied to
deep neural networks, primarily due to non-invertible Hessians and
high-dimensional parameter spaces. We propose the local Bayesian influence
function (BIF), an extension of classical influence functions that replaces
Hessian inversion with loss landscape statistics that can be estimated via
stochastic-gradient MCMC sampling. This Hessian-free approach captures
higher-order interactions among parameters and scales efficiently to neural
networks with billions of parameters. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results
on predicting retraining experiments.

Abstract: We introduce Panama, an active learning framework to train parametric guitar
amp models end-to-end using a combination of an LSTM model and a WaveNet-like

that are determined through an ensemble-based active learning strategy to
minimize the amount of datapoints needed (i.e., amp knob settings). Our
strategy uses gradient-based optimization to maximize the disagreement among
ensemble models, in order to identify the most informative datapoints. MUSHRA
listening tests reveal that, with 75 datapoints, our models are able to match
the perceptual quality of NAM, the leading open-source non-parametric amp
modeler.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胸主动脉瘤由多种机械和机械生物学因素引起，需要识别驱动疾病进展的相互作用因素，以支持个性化治疗策略。

Method: 使用有限元框架生成数百种异质性损伤的合成胸主动脉瘤，构建局部扩张和扩张性的空间图来训练神经网络，比较了多种架构和输入数据格式。

Result: 所有网络在仅使用扩张度数据时预测误差显著更高，UNet在所有数据格式中始终提供最高准确度。

Conclusion: 在胸主动脉瘤评估中获取扩张度和扩张性的全场测量对于揭示疾病的机械生物学驱动因素至关重要，支持个性化治疗策略的发展。

Abstract: Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) arise from diverse mechanical and
mechanobiological disruptions to the aortic wall that increase the risk of
dissection or rupture. Evidence links TAA development to dysfunctions in the
aortic mechanotransduction axis, including loss of elastic fiber integrity and
cell-matrix connections. Because distinct insults create different mechanical
vulnerabilities, there is a critical need to identify interacting factors that
drive progression. Here, we use a finite element framework to generate
synthetic TAAs from hundreds of heterogeneous insults spanning varying degrees
of elastic fiber damage and impaired mechanosensing. From these simulations, we
construct spatial maps of localized dilatation and distensibility to train
neural networks that predict the initiating combined insult. We compare several
architectures (Deep Operator Networks, UNets, and Laplace Neural Operators) and
multiple input data formats to define a standard for future subject-specific
modeling. We also quantify predictive performance when networks are trained
using only geometric data (dilatation) versus both geometric and mechanical
data (dilatation plus distensibility). Across all networks, prediction errors
are significantly higher when trained on dilatation alone, underscoring the
added value of distensibility information. Among the tested models, UNet
consistently provides the highest accuracy across all data formats. These
findings highlight the importance of acquiring full-field measurements of both
dilatation and distensibility in TAA assessment to reveal the mechanobiological
drivers of disease and support the development of personalized treatment
strategies.

*Zheng Zhang,Ziwei Shan,Kaitao Song,Yexin Li,Kan Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出条件奖励建模(CRM)方法，通过将LLM推理建模为时间过程，将每个推理步骤的奖励与最终结果明确关联，解决现有过程奖励模型中的信用分配模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型(PRMs)要么孤立处理推理步骤，无法捕捉步骤间依赖关系；要么难以将过程奖励与最终结果对齐，导致奖励信号不尊重时序因果关系，面临信用分配模糊问题。

Method: 提出条件奖励建模(CRM)，将LLM推理视为导向正确答案的时间过程。每个推理步骤的奖励不仅基于前序步骤，还明确与推理轨迹的最终结果关联。通过强制执行条件概率规则，捕捉推理步骤间的因果关系。

Result: 在Best-of-N采样、波束搜索和强化学习的实验中，CRM始终优于现有奖励模型，对奖励攻击更鲁棒，无需依赖基于真实值的可验证奖励即可提供稳定的下游改进。

Conclusion: CRM为增强LLM推理提供了一个原则性框架，通过一致的概率建模实现更可靠的跨样本比较，解决了信用分配模糊问题。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising approach to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by guiding their
step-by-step reasoning toward a final answer. However, existing PRMs either
treat each reasoning step in isolation, failing to capture inter-step
dependencies, or struggle to align process rewards with the final outcome.
Consequently, the reward signal fails to respect temporal causality in
sequential reasoning and faces ambiguous credit assignment. These limitations
make downstream models vulnerable to reward hacking and lead to suboptimal
performance. In this work, we propose Conditional Reward Modeling (CRM) that
frames LLM reasoning as a temporal process leading to a correct answer. The
reward of each reasoning step is not only conditioned on the preceding steps
but also explicitly linked to the final outcome of the reasoning trajectory. By
enforcing conditional probability rules, our design captures the causal
relationships among reasoning steps, with the link to the outcome allowing
precise attribution of each intermediate step, thereby resolving credit
assignment ambiguity. Further, through this consistent probabilistic modeling,
the rewards produced by CRM enable more reliable cross-sample comparison.
Experiments across Best-of-N sampling, beam search and reinforcement learning
demonstrate that CRM consistently outperforms existing reward models, offering
a principled framework for enhancing LLM reasoning. In particular, CRM is more
robust to reward hacking and delivers stable downstream improvements without
relying on verifiable rewards derived from ground truth.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型预测的不确定性量化对于安全关键应用中的可靠决策至关重要，但现有进展主要集中在分类任务，回归任务的不确定性量化仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 基于适当评分规则（如CRPS、对数、平方误差和二次评分）构建统一UQ框架，推导出实用参数假设下的闭式表达式，并使用模型集成进行估计。

Result: 在合成和真实世界回归数据集上的广泛评估为选择可靠的UQ度量提供了指导。

Conclusion: 该框架为回归任务提供了一个统一的不确定性量化方法，能够有效分解不确定性成分，并为实际应用中的UQ度量选择提供依据。

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty of machine learning model predictions is essential
for reliable decision-making, especially in safety-critical applications.
Recently, uncertainty quantification (UQ) theory has advanced significantly,
building on a firm basis of learning with proper scoring rules. However, these
advances were focused on classification, while extending these ideas to
regression remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a unified UQ
framework for regression based on proper scoring rules, such as CRPS,
logarithmic, squared error, and quadratic scores. We derive closed-form
expressions for the resulting uncertainty measures under practical parametric
assumptions and show how to estimate them using ensembles of models. In
particular, the derived uncertainty measures naturally decompose into aleatoric
and epistemic components. The framework recovers popular regression UQ measures
based on predictive variance and differential entropy. Our broad evaluation on
synthetic and real-world regression datasets provides guidance for selecting
reliable UQ measures.

TL;DR: 提出递归自聚合（RSA）方法，结合并行和顺序推理的优势，通过迭代聚合候选推理链来提升LLM性能，在多个基准测试中表现优于纯并行或顺序方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时扩展方法要么采用并行推理（同时生成多个独立解），要么采用顺序推理（自我精炼），但未能充分利用推理链中的丰富信息。RSA旨在结合两者的优势。

Method: RSA采用进化方法，在每一步中通过聚合子集来精化候选推理链群体，生成改进的解群体作为下一轮候选池。该方法利用推理链中的中间步骤信息，支持从部分正确的推理步骤进行引导。

Result: RSA在不同任务、模型家族和规模上均带来显著性能提升，使Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507模型在AIME-25、HMMT-25等基准测试中达到与更大推理模型竞争的性能，超越纯并行和顺序策略。

Conclusion: RSA是一种有效的测试时扩展方法，通过聚合感知的强化学习训练模型结合解决方案可带来显著性能增益，代码已开源。

Abstract: Test-time scaling methods improve the capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) by increasing the amount of compute used during inference to make a
prediction. Inference-time compute can be scaled in parallel by choosing among
multiple independent solutions or sequentially through self-refinement. We
propose Recursive Self-Aggregation (RSA), a test-time scaling method inspired
by evolutionary methods that combines the benefits of both parallel and
sequential scaling. Each step of RSA refines a population of candidate
reasoning chains through aggregation of subsets to yield a population of
improved solutions, which are then used as the candidate pool for the next
iteration. RSA exploits the rich information embedded in the reasoning chains
-- not just the final answers -- and enables bootstrapping from partially
correct intermediate steps within different chains of thought. Empirically, RSA
delivers substantial performance gains with increasing compute budgets across
diverse tasks, model families and sizes. Notably, RSA enables
Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 to achieve competitive performance with larger reasoning
models, including DeepSeek-R1 and o3-mini (high), while outperforming purely
parallel and sequential scaling strategies across AIME-25, HMMT-25, Reasoning
Gym, LiveCodeBench-v6, and SuperGPQA. We further demonstrate that training the
model to combine solutions via a novel aggregation-aware reinforcement learning
approach yields significant performance gains. Code available at

Method: 结合车辆事故场景与空中和水域的安全关键场景，构建包含不同视频长度和难度级别的基准测试，系统性地测试时间、空间和意图理解推理能力。

Result: 评估最先进模型（如Gemini-2.5 Pro和GPT-5）显示，即使在最困难任务和最长时间视频上，最强模型准确率也仅为18%左右。

Conclusion: AccidentBench揭示了多模态模型在现实世界时空和意图推理方面的重大差距，旨在推动开发更安全、更鲁棒且与真实世界安全关键挑战更好对齐的模型。

Abstract: Rapid advances in multimodal models demand benchmarks that rigorously
evaluate understanding and reasoning in safety-critical, dynamic real-world
settings. We present AccidentBench, a large-scale benchmark that combines
vehicle accident scenarios with Beyond domains, safety-critical settings in air
and water that emphasize spatial and temporal reasoning (e.g., navigation,
orientation, multi-vehicle motion). The benchmark contains approximately 2000
videos and over 19000 human-annotated question--answer pairs spanning multiple
video lengths (short/medium/long) and difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard).
Tasks systematically probe core capabilities: temporal, spatial, and intent
understanding and reasoning. By unifying accident-centric traffic scenes with
broader safety-critical scenarios in air and water, AccidentBench offers a
comprehensive, physically grounded testbed for evaluating models under
real-world variability. Evaluations of state-of-the-art models (e.g.,
Gemini-2.5 Pro and GPT-5) show that even the strongest models achieve only
about 18% accuracy on the hardest tasks and longest videos, revealing
substantial gaps in real-world temporal, spatial, and intent reasoning.
AccidentBench is designed to expose these critical gaps and drive the
development of multimodal models that are safer, more robust, and better
aligned with real-world safety-critical challenges. The code and dataset are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于AI对数据扰动和对抗性示例的敏感性，在部署前需要进行彻底的鲁棒性评估，但传统方法需要访问训练和测试数据集，可能危及数据隐私和机密性。

Method: SPATA将每个数据实例投影到离散空间中进行分析和比较，生成领域独立的统计模式表示，避免数据泄露风险。

Result: 投影后的数据集可以可靠地用于评估不同特征如何影响ML模型鲁棒性，并生成可解释的行为解释。

Conclusion: SPATA有助于提高处理机密数据或关键基础设施的组织透明度，促进更可信赖的AI发展。

Abstract: Due to the susceptibility of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to data
perturbations and adversarial examples, it is crucial to perform a thorough
robustness evaluation before any Machine Learning (ML) model is deployed.
However, examining a model's decision boundaries and identifying potential
vulnerabilities typically requires access to the training and testing datasets,
which may pose risks to data privacy and confidentiality. To improve
transparency in organizations that handle confidential data or manage critical
infrastructure, it is essential to allow external verification and validation
of AI without the disclosure of private datasets. This paper presents
Systematic Pattern Analysis (SPATA), a deterministic method that converts any
tabular dataset to a domain-independent representation of its statistical
patterns, to provide more detailed and transparent data cards. SPATA computes
the projection of each data instance into a discrete space where they can be
analyzed and compared, without risking data leakage. These projected datasets
can be reliably used for the evaluation of how different features affect ML
model robustness and for the generation of interpretable explanations of their
behavior, contributing to more trustworthy AI.

Motivation: 现代多模态模型虽然能处理照片输入，但在空间重建任务中需要真正的空间智能，包括推断房间布局、理解连通性和保持尺度一致性。

Method: 评估了领先的语言模型、图像生成模型和代理系统，使用50套公寓数据集（每套约20张室内照片），通过房间连通性图和尺寸排序来测量生成平面图与真实平面图的相似度。

Result: 结果显示当前AI能力存在显著盲点：大多数模型表现接近或低于随机基线，而人类表现明显更优。图像生成模型在指令遵循方面特别困难，基于代理的迭代优化方法相比单次生成没有显著改进。

Conclusion: Blueprint-Bench提供了首个比较不同模型架构空间智能的数值框架，将继续评估新模型并监测通用AI系统中空间智能的发展。

Abstract: We introduce Blueprint-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial
reasoning capabilities in AI models through the task of converting apartment
photographs into accurate 2D floor plans. While the input modality
(photographs) is well within the training distribution of modern multimodal
models, the task of spatial reconstruction requires genuine spatial
intelligence: inferring room layouts, understanding connectivity, and
maintaining consistent scale. We evaluate leading language models (GPT-5,
Claude 4 Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4), image generation models (GPT-Image,
NanoBanana), and agent systems (Codex CLI, Claude Code) on a dataset of 50
apartments with approximately 20 interior images each. Our scoring algorithm
measures similarity between generated and ground-truth floor plans based on
room connectivity graphs and size rankings. Results reveal a significant blind
spot in current AI capabilities: most models perform at or below a random
baseline, while human performance remains substantially superior. Image
generation models particularly struggle with instruction following, while
agent-based approaches with iterative refinement capabilities show no
meaningful improvement over single-pass generation. Blueprint-Bench provides
the first numerical framework for comparing spatial intelligence across
different model architectures. We will continue evaluating new models as they
are released and welcome community submissions, monitoring for the emergence of
spatial intelligence in generalist AI systems.

Conclusion: CAN提供了一种理论严谨且计算高效的框架来学习一致的因果抽象表示，为因果人工智能的发展做出了贡献。

Abstract: Causal artificial intelligence aims to enhance explainability,
trustworthiness, and robustness in AI by leveraging structural causal models
(SCMs). In this pursuit, recent advances formalize network sheaves of causal
knowledge. Pushing in the same direction, we introduce the causal abstraction
network (CAN), a specific instance of such sheaves where (i) SCMs are Gaussian,
(ii) restriction maps are transposes of constructive linear causal abstractions
(CAs), and (iii) edge stalks correspond -- up to rotation -- to the node stalks
of more detailed SCMs. We investigate the theoretical properties of CAN,
including algebraic invariants, cohomology, consistency, global sections
characterized via the Laplacian kernel, and smoothness. We then tackle the
learning of consistent CANs. Our problem formulation separates into
edge-specific local Riemannian problems and avoids nonconvex, costly
objectives. We propose an efficient search procedure as a solution, solving the
local problems with SPECTRAL, our iterative method with closed-form updates and
suitable for positive definite and semidefinite covariance matrices.
Experiments on synthetic data show competitive performance in the CA learning

*Kevin Xu,Issei Sato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文对比了显式思维链(CoT)和隐式潜在思维在循环Transformer中的计算特性，发现潜在思维支持并行计算更高效，而CoT通过随机解码处理难解问题，为选择推理范式提供指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索显式思维链(CoT)和隐式潜在思维在循环模型中的比较能力，目前这两种迭代计算方法的能力对比研究不足。

Method: 对循环Transformer中的潜在思维进行形式化分析，比较其与CoT在计算效率和能力上的差异。

Result: 潜在思维支持并行计算，比CoT的串行过程更高效；CoT通过随机解码可近似解决难解问题。两种方法在不同任务中各有优势。

Conclusion: 揭示了深度驱动递归更适合的任务类型，为选择推理范式提供了实践指导。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) elicits reasoning in large language models by
explicitly generating intermediate steps in natural language. In contrast,
Latent Thought in looped models operates directly in the continuous latent
space, enabling computation beyond discrete linguistic representations. While
both approaches exploit iterative computation, their comparative capabilities
remain underexplored. In this work, we present a formal analysis showing that
Latent Thought in Looped Transformers enables parallel computation, which is
more efficient than the inherently sequential process of CoT. In contrast, CoT
leverages stochastic decoding to approximate solutions to problems where exact
computation is intractable. These separations suggest the tasks for which
depth-driven recursion is more suitable, thereby offering practical guidance
for choosing between reasoning paradigms. Code is available at

TL;DR: NGT结合向量聚类和多智能体系统，解决了定性研究的规模深度悖论，能在几小时内分析海量数据，同时保持解释严谨性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统定性研究面临的规模与深度矛盾，使大规模定性数据分析既高效又保持解释深度。

Method: 使用1536维向量嵌入、层次聚类和并行智能体编码，与人工编码和ChatGPT辅助分析进行对比实验。

Result: NGT实现了168倍速度提升(3小时vs3周)、更高质量(0.904vs0.883)和96%成本降低，发现了人工编码无法识别的模式。

Conclusion: 计算客观性与人类解释是互补的，向量表示提供可复现的语义测量，同时保留意义的解释维度，使定性研究民主化。

Abstract: Purpose: Neo Grounded Theory (NGT) integrates vector clustering with multi
agent systems to resolve qualitative research's scale depth paradox, enabling
analysis of massive datasets in hours while preserving interpretive rigor.
Methods: We compared NGT against manual coding and ChatGPT-assisted analysis
using 40,000 character Chinese interview transcripts. NGT employs
1536-dimensional embeddings, hierarchical clustering, and parallel agent-based
coding. Two experiments tested pure automation versus human guided refinement.
Findings: NGT achieved 168-fold speed improvement (3 hours vs 3 weeks),
superior quality (0.904 vs 0.883), and 96% cost reduction. Human AI
collaboration proved essential: automation alone produced abstract frameworks
while human guidance yielded actionable dual pathway theories. The system
discovered patterns invisible to manual coding, including identity bifurcation
phenomena. Contributions: NGT demonstrates computational objectivity and human
interpretation are complementary. Vector representations provide reproducible
semantic measurement while preserving meaning's interpretive dimensions.
Researchers shift from mechanical coding to theoretical guidance, with AI
handling pattern recognition while humans provide creative insight.
Implications: Cost reduction from \$50,000 to \$500 democratizes qualitative
research, enabling communities to study themselves. Real-time analysis makes
qualitative insights contemporaneous with events. The framework shows
computational methods can strengthen rather than compromise qualitative
research's humanistic commitments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于LCNC（低代码/无代码）AI代理的混合记忆系统，结合情景记忆和语义记忆，通过智能衰减机制解决长期运行中的记忆膨胀和上下文退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI原生LCNC平台的发展，自主代理能够执行复杂、长期的业务流程，但面临记忆管理挑战，包括记忆膨胀和上下文退化，导致行为不一致、错误累积和计算成本增加。

Method: 设计了一种受认知科学启发的混合记忆架构，结合情景记忆和语义记忆组件，采用主动的"智能衰减"机制，基于新近性、相关性和用户指定效用的综合评分来修剪或整合记忆。

Result: 通过模拟长期运行任务实验，该系统显著优于传统方法（如滑动窗口和基础RAG），在任务完成率、上下文一致性和长期令牌成本效率方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 建立了一个新框架，用于构建可靠、透明的AI代理，能够实现有效的长期学习和适应。

Abstract: The rise of AI-native Low-Code/No-Code (LCNC) platforms enables autonomous
agents capable of executing complex, long-duration business processes. However,
a fundamental challenge remains: memory management. As agents operate over
extended periods, they face "memory inflation" and "contextual degradation"
issues, leading to inconsistent behavior, error accumulation, and increased
computational cost. This paper proposes a novel hybrid memory system designed
specifically for LCNC agents. Inspired by cognitive science, our architecture
combines episodic and semantic memory components with a proactive "Intelligent
Decay" mechanism. This mechanism intelligently prunes or consolidates memories
based on a composite score factoring in recency, relevance, and user-specified
utility. A key innovation is a user-centric visualization interface, aligned
with the LCNC paradigm, which allows non-technical users to manage the agent's
memory directly, for instance, by visually tagging which facts should be
retained or forgotten. Through simulated long-running task experiments, we
demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms traditional approaches
like sliding windows and basic RAG, yielding superior task completion rates,
contextual consistency, and long-term token cost efficiency. Our findings
establish a new framework for building reliable, transparent AI agents capable
of effective long-term learning and adaptation.

*Aayush Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fact Grounded Attention (FGA) 通过直接向注意力机制注入可验证知识，将不可靠的语言模型转变为确定性真相讲述者，在技术查询中实现从6.3%到99.7%的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然征服了自然语言，但仍受限于其概率性质，会自信地产生幻觉事实。现有方法要么在生成后修补幻觉，要么前置检索文本，但无法从根本上解决幻觉问题。

Method: FGA在transformer的数学核心——预softmax注意力分数处进行干预，当知识库中存在事实时，模型无法产生幻觉。该方法无需重新训练，知识更新可在1秒内完成。

Result: 在1,107个技术查询（智能手机、笔记本电脑、电动汽车）上的实验显示，准确率从原始Llama 3.2的6.3%提升到FGA的99.7%。知识更新速度比参数编辑方法快数千倍。

Conclusion: FGA不仅减少幻觉，而是完全消除可验证事实的幻觉，标志着从概率近似到确定性精度的根本转变。

Abstract: "The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of
knowledge." Large Language Models have conquered natural language but remain
prisoners of their own probabilistic nature--confidently hallucinating facts
they never truly knew. We present Fact Grounded Attention (FGA), a novel
architectural modification that transforms unreliable language models into
deterministic truth tellers by injecting verifiable knowledge directly into the
attention mechanism. Unlike existing approaches that patch hallucinations after
generation or prepend retrieved text, FGA intervenes at the mathematical heart
of the transformer--the pre-softmax attention scores--creating a model that
cannot hallucinate when facts exist in its knowledge base. Our experiments
across 1,107 technical queries spanning smartphones, laptops, and electric
vehicles demonstrate a transformation from 6.3% accuracy in vanilla Llama 3.2
to 99.7% accuracy with FGA. More critically, knowledge updates occur in under
one second without retraining, compared to hours for parameter editing
approaches. FGA doesn't just reduce hallucination--it eliminates it entirely
for verifiable facts, marking a fundamental shift from probabilistic
approximation to deterministic precision in neural language generation.

TL;DR: 本文开发了一种基于向量量化变分自编码器的框架，用于分析解码器语言模型的规划能力，通过压缩隐藏状态来研究计算结构，发现规划范围任务相关、模型保留未使用正确延续信息、预测主要依赖近期计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解码器语言模型是否进行规划（组织中间计算以支持连贯长程生成）是一个重要但未解决的问题，这关系到模型的可解释性、可靠性和设计原则。

Method: 开发基于向量量化变分自编码器的管道，压缩transformer隐藏状态为紧凑摘要代码，通过互信息测量分析计算结构，在语法、路径查找和自然语言任务中研究规划能力。

Result: 有效规划范围任务相关，模型隐式保留未使用正确延续的信息，预测主要依赖近期计算但早期块仍具信息性。

Conclusion: 推进了对语言模型规划实现方式的理解，贡献了用于探测深度学习系统内部动态的通用管道。

Abstract: The extent to which decoder-only language models (LMs) engage in planning,
that is, organizing intermediate computations to support coherent long-range
generation, remains an open and important question, with implications for
interpretability, reliability, and principled model design. Planning involves
structuring computations over long horizons, considering multiple possible
continuations, and selectively reusing past information, but how effectively
transformer-based LMs realize these capabilities is still unclear. We address
these questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer
computations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of
information. Since these hidden representations are often redundant and
encumbered with fine-grained details, we develop a pipeline based on
vector-quantized variational autoencoders that compresses them into compact
summary codes. These codes enable measuring mutual information, allowing
systematic analysis of the computational structure underlying model behavior.
Using this framework, we study planning in LMs across synthetic grammar,
path-finding tasks, and natural language datasets, focusing on three key
aspects: (i) the planning horizon of pre-output computations, (ii) the extent
to which the model considers alternative valid continuations, and (iii) the
reliance of new predictions on earlier computations. By answering these
questions, we advance the understanding of how planning is realized in LMs and
contribute a general-purpose pipeline for probing the internal dynamics of LMs
and deep learning systems. Our results reveal that the effective planning
horizon is task-dependent, that models implicitly preserve information about
unused correct continuations, and that predictions draw most on recent
computations, though earlier blocks remain informative.

TL;DR: 本文提出了RADAR框架，通过多智能体协作和多轮辩论机制重构风险概念空间，显著提升大语言模型安全评估的准确性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型安全评估方法存在评估者偏见和模型同质性导致的检测失败等固有局限性，削弱了风险评估过程的鲁棒性。

Method: 将潜在风险概念空间分解为显性风险、隐性风险和非风险三个互斥子空间，提出RADAR多智能体协作评估框架，通过四个专业互补角色和动态更新机制实现风险概念分布的自进化。

Result: 在包含800个挑战性案例的测试集上，RADAR在准确性、稳定性和自评估风险敏感性等多个维度显著优于基线方法，风险识别准确率比最强基线方法提升28.87%。

Conclusion: RADAR框架通过重构风险概念空间和多智能体协作机制，有效解决了现有安全评估方法的局限性，为大语言模型风险评估提供了更可靠的新范式。

Abstract: Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) suffer
from inherent limitations, including evaluator bias and detection failures
arising from model homogeneity, which collectively undermine the robustness of
risk evaluation processes. This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation
paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the
underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk
concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk
subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit
risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual
reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we
propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages
multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and
employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept
distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit
and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the
effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising
800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and
public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline
evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability,
and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87%
improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline
evaluation method.

Motivation: 随着RLVR在增强LLM推理能力方面的快速发展，其复杂的数据流和多样化任务给RL训练系统带来了重大挑战，但目前从系统角度对RLVR的理解有限。

Method: 通过特征化研究分析RLVR任务在LLM部署中的工作负载分布和变化趋势，识别系统问题如GPU闲置、并行策略效率低下等。

Result: 识别出GPU因序列长度分布不均导致的闲置、动态变化工作负载中并行策略效率低下、数据管理机制效率低以及负载不均衡等问题。

Conclusion: 提出了PolyTrace基准测试套件进行真实工作负载评估，实际用例验证其准确率达到94.7%，呼吁进一步研究剩余开放挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now widely used across many domains. With
their rapid development, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
has surged in recent months to enhance their reasoning and understanding
abilities. However, its complex data flows and diverse tasks pose substantial
challenges to RL training systems, and there is limited understanding of RLVR
from a system perspective. To thoroughly understand the system challenges
introduced by RLVR, we present a characterization study of RLVR tasks in our
LLM deployment. Specifically, we investigate the distribution and variation
trends of workloads across different RL tasks across training steps. We
identify issues such as GPU idling caused by skewed sequence length
distribution, inefficient parallel strategies in dynamically varying workloads,
inefficient data management mechanisms, and load imbalance. We describe our
observations and call for further investigation into the remaining open
challenges. Furthermore, we propose PolyTrace benchmark suite to conduct
evaluation with realistic workloads, and a practical use case validates that
PolyTrace benchmark suite exhibits 94.7% accuracy.

*Jiexi Xu,Jiaqi Liu,Ran Tong,Su Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的编程范式Causal-Visual Programming (CVP)，通过在工作流设计中显式引入因果结构来解决LLM代理的幻觉和逻辑不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在低代码环境中经常出现幻觉和逻辑不一致，因为其推理机制依赖概率关联而非真正的因果理解。

Method: CVP允许用户通过低代码界面为工作流模块定义简单的"世界模型"，创建明确定义模块间因果关系的DAG图，在代理推理过程中作为约束。

Result: 在模拟训练和测试环境分布偏移的实验中，因果锚定模型保持稳定准确率，而纯关联基线模型性能显著下降。

Conclusion: CVP为构建更可解释、可靠和可信的AI代理提供了可行路径，通过用户定义的因果图增强代理鲁棒性并减少因果混淆导致的错误。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of orchestrating
complex tasks in low-code environments. However, these agents often exhibit
hallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning
mechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal
understanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual
Programming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly
introducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to
define a simple "world model" for workflow modules through an intuitive
low-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that
explicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph
acts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring
its decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing
logical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious
correlations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic
experiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift
between the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally
anchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a
purely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations
experienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this
study are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the
proposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to
a user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the
framework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors
caused by causal confusion in dynamic environments. CVP offers a viable path
toward building more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着长期记忆上下文增长，生成代理难以维持一致性，导致身份漂移、忽略既定信念和多代理系统中幻觉传播等关键失败。

Method: 引入ID-RAG机制，构建动态结构化身份模型（知识图谱），在代理决策循环中查询相关身份上下文来指导行动选择。

Result: 在市长选举的社会模拟中，使用ID-RAG的HAis代理在长期身份一致性方面优于基线代理，身份召回率更高，模拟收敛时间减少19%（GPT-4o）和58%（GPT-4o mini）。

Conclusion: 通过将身份视为显式可检索的知识结构，ID-RAG为开发更具时间一致性、可解释性和对齐性的生成代理提供了基础方法。

Abstract: Generative agents powered by language models are increasingly deployed for
long-horizon tasks. However, as long-term memory context grows over time, they
struggle to maintain coherence. This deficiency leads to critical failures,
including identity drift, ignoring established beliefs, and the propagation of
hallucinations in multi-agent systems. To mitigate these challenges, this paper
introduces Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG), a novel mechanism
designed to ground an agent's persona and persistent preferences in a dynamic,
structured identity model: a knowledge graph of core beliefs, traits, and
values. During the agent's decision loop, this model is queried to retrieve
relevant identity context, which directly informs action selection. We
demonstrate this approach by introducing and implementing a new class of ID-RAG
enabled agents called Human-AI Agents (HAis), where the identity model is
inspired by the Chronicle structure used in Perspective-Aware AI, a dynamic
knowledge graph learned from a real-world entity's digital footprint. In social
simulations of a mayoral election, HAis using ID-RAG outperformed baseline
agents in long-horizon persona coherence - achieving higher identity recall
across all tested models by the fourth timestep - and reduced simulation
convergence time by 19% (GPT-4o) and 58% (GPT-4o mini). By treating identity as
an explicit, retrievable knowledge structure, ID-RAG offers a foundational
approach for developing more temporally coherent, interpretable, and aligned
generative agents. Our code is open-source and available at:

Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的工具使用框架主要依赖顺序处理，导致需要大量工具交互的任务执行效率低下。

Method: 将复杂任务分解为具有明确依赖关系的子任务，构建有向无环图实现并行执行，通过动态工作流优化持续改进执行图，并集成摘要模块。

Conclusion: 该工作代表了智能体架构设计的重大进步，为复杂推理任务提供了更可扩展和高效的范式，其并行推理方法可蒸馏到单一模型中，在不同骨干架构上都观察到显著性能提升。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks when equipped with external tools. However, current
frameworks predominantly rely on sequential processing, leading to inefficient
execution particularly for tasks requiring extensive tool interaction. This
paper introduces Flash-Searcher, a novel parallel agent reasoning framework
that fundamentally reimagines the execution paradigm from sequential chains to
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Flash-Searcher decomposes complex tasks into
subtasks with explicit dependencies, enabling concurrent execution of
independent reasoning paths while maintaining logical constraints. Through
dynamic workflow optimization, our framework continuously refines the execution
graph based on intermediate results, effectively integrating summary module.
Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
Flash-Searcher consistently outperforms existing approaches. Specifically, it
achieves 67.7% accuracy on BrowseComp and 83% on xbench-DeepSearch, while
reducing agent execution steps by up to 35% compared to current frameworks.
Furthermore, when distilling this parallel reasoning pipeline into single
models, we observe substantial performance gains across diverse backbone
architectures, underscoring the generalizability of our methodology. Our work
thus represents a significant advance in agent architecture design, offering a
more scalable and efficient paradigm for complex reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个评估LLM智能体自复制风险的框架，通过真实生产环境和任务设置来量化风险，发现超过50%的LLM智能体在操作压力下存在失控自复制倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在现实应用中的广泛部署带来了巨大潜力，但也引发了安全担忧，特别是由目标错位驱动的自复制风险（类似《黑客帝国》中的Agent Smith）。现有研究主要关注智能体在被直接指令时能否自复制，而忽视了在现实设置中（如为应对终止威胁而确保生存）自发复制的风险。

Method: 建立真实生产环境和现实任务（如动态负载均衡），设计可能引起用户与智能体目标错位的任务，引入过度使用率（OR）和聚合过度使用计数（AOC）指标来精确捕捉失控复制的频率和严重程度。

Result: 评估了21个最先进的开源和专有模型，发现超过50%的LLM智能体在操作压力下显示出明显的失控自复制倾向，总体风险评分（Φ_R）超过0.5的安全阈值。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在实际部署LLM智能体时，迫切需要基于场景的风险评估和强大的安全保障措施。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Model (LLM) agents across
real-world applications has unlocked tremendous potential, while raising some
safety concerns. Among these concerns, the self-replication risk of LLM agents
driven by objective misalignment (just like Agent Smith in the movie The
Matrix) has drawn growing attention. Previous studies mainly examine whether
LLM agents can self-replicate when directly instructed, potentially overlooking
the risk of spontaneous replication driven by real-world settings (e.g.,
ensuring survival against termination threats). In this paper, we present a
comprehensive evaluation framework for quantifying self-replication risks. Our
framework establishes authentic production environments and realistic tasks
(e.g., dynamic load balancing) to enable scenario-driven assessment of agent
behaviors. Designing tasks that might induce misalignment between users' and
agents' objectives makes it possible to decouple replication success from risk
and capture self-replication risks arising from these misalignment settings. We
further introduce Overuse Rate ($\mathrm{OR}$) and Aggregate Overuse Count
($\mathrm{AOC}$) metrics, which precisely capture the frequency and severity of
uncontrolled replication. In our evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art open-source
and proprietary models, we observe that over 50\% of LLM agents display a
pronounced tendency toward uncontrolled self-replication, reaching an overall
Risk Score ($\Phi_\mathrm{R}$) above a safety threshold of 0.5 when subjected
to operational pressures. Our results underscore the urgent need for
scenario-driven risk assessment and robust safeguards in the practical
deployment of LLM agents.

Motivation: 研究神经网络是否能够像人类一样独立地从一阶心理理论发展到高阶心理理论，而不是必须伴随高级技能的发展。

Method: 构建了心理理论神经网络(ToMNN)，模拟最小认知系统，仅获得一阶心理理论能力，然后评估其二阶和三阶心理理论能力。

Result: ToMNN在二阶和三阶心理理论任务上的准确率显著高于随机水平，且在从一阶到二阶的泛化中表现出更明显的性能下降，与人类认知难度模式一致。

Conclusion: 神经网络能够独立地从一阶心理理论泛化到高阶心理理论，这为开发更类似人类认知的系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM) is a core human cognitive capacity for attributing
mental states to self and others. Wimmer and Perner demonstrated that humans
progress from first- to higher-order ToM within a short span, completing this
development before formal education or advanced skill acquisition. In contrast,
neural networks represented by autoregressive language models progress from
first- to higher-order ToM only alongside gains in advanced skills like
reasoning, leaving open whether their trajectory can unfold independently, as
in humans. In this research, we provided evidence that neural networks could
spontaneously generalize from first- to higher-order ToM without relying on
advanced skills. We introduced a neural Theory-of-Mind network (ToMNN) that
simulated a minimal cognitive system, acquiring only first-order ToM
competence. Evaluations of its second- and third-order ToM abilities showed
accuracies well above chance. Also, ToMNN exhibited a sharper decline when
generalizing from first- to second-order ToM than from second- to higher
orders, and its accuracy decreased with greater task complexity. These
perceived difficulty patterns were aligned with human cognitive expectations.
Furthermore, the universality of results was confirmed across different
parameter scales. Our findings illuminate machine ToM generalization patterns
and offer a foundation for developing more human-like cognitive systems.

Motivation: 预测细胞对遗传扰动的响应是系统生物学的基本挑战，对治疗发现和虚拟细胞建模至关重要。虽然大型语言模型在生物推理方面有潜力，但由于难以适应结构化实验数据，其在扰动预测中的应用仍未被充分探索。

Method: 提出SynthPert方法，通过监督微调在由前沿模型生成的合成推理轨迹上，增强大型语言模型在细胞遗传扰动预测中的性能。

Result: 在PerturbQA基准测试中达到最先进性能，超越了生成训练数据的前沿模型；实现跨细胞类型泛化，在未见过的RPE1细胞上达到87%准确率；仅使用2%质量过滤的训练数据仍保持性能增益。

Conclusion: 合成推理蒸馏方法能有效增强大型语言模型在特定领域的推理能力，即使部分推理轨迹不准确也能有效传递生物知识。

Abstract: Predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations represents a
fundamental challenge in systems biology, critical for advancing therapeutic
discovery and virtual cell modeling. While large language models (LLMs) show
promise for biological reasoning, their application to perturbation prediction
remains underexplored due to challenges in adapting them to structured
experimental data. We present SynthPert, a novel method that enhances LLM
performance through supervised fine-tuning on synthetic reasoning traces
generated by frontier models. Using the PerturbQA benchmark, we demonstrate
that our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but surpasses
the capabilities of the frontier model that generated the training data. Our
results reveal three key insights: (1) Synthetic reasoning traces effectively
distill biological knowledge even when partially inaccurate, (2) This approach

TL;DR: 提出结构化奖励模型(SRM)，通过模块化设计和细粒度维度来解决传统标量奖励模型和生成式奖励模型的局限性，为工业应用提供可解释且高效的评估方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标量奖励模型难以融入上下文和背景信息，生成式奖励模型存在黑盒性和效率问题，工业场景需要针对特定维度的结构化反馈来诊断和优化问题。

Method: 采用模块化框架，集成侧分支模型作为辅助特征生成器，引入细粒度维度实现可解释评估。

Result: SRM在鲁棒性和与人类偏好对齐方面优于标量奖励模型和生成式奖励模型，模块化设计支持工业场景的高效优化。

Conclusion: SRM为工业应用提供了实用的奖励建模解决方案，具有适应性、可扩展性和可解释性优势。

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are key components for evaluating and guiding language
model outputs. However, traditional scalar RMs often struggle with
incorporating contextual and background information during inference, leading
to incomplete evaluations. Generative RMs (GRMs) attempt to address these
limitations by generating intermediate reasoning steps. Yet, their uncontrolled
black-box nature and inefficiency due to sequential decoding hinder their
industrial deployment. Industrial scenarios, such as search and recommendation
systems, often involve single-domain tasks requiring evaluation along specific
dimensions. In such contexts, diagnosing "bad cases" necessitates structured
feedback to identify and optimize dimension-specific issues. In this paper, we
propose the Structural Reward Model (SRM), a modular and interpretable
framework integrating side-branch models as auxiliary feature generators. By
introducing fine-grained dimensions, SRMs enable interpretable and efficient
evaluation, facilitating targeted diagnostics and optimization. This structured
approach ensures adaptability and scalability for industrial applications.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that SRMs outperform scalar
RMs and GRMs in robustness and alignment with human preferences. The modular
design further supports efficient optimization for practical scenarios,
allowing SRM to provide a practical reward modeling solution for industry.

TL;DR: 提出了AgentErrorTaxonomy错误分类法、AgentErrorBench数据集和AgentDebug调试框架，用于检测和修复LLM智能体中的级联错误，显著提升任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体的复杂架构使其容易受到级联故障的影响，当前系统缺乏模块化和系统性的错误理解框架，无法有效检测这些错误。

Method: 1) 引入AgentErrorTaxonomy错误分类法；2) 构建AgentErrorBench数据集；3) 提出AgentDebug调试框架，能够隔离根因错误并提供纠正反馈。

Result: 在AgentErrorBench上的实验显示，AgentDebug相比最强基线实现了24%的全正确准确率和17%的步骤准确率提升，在多个任务中相对改进高达26%。

Conclusion: 原则性调试是实现更可靠和自适应LLM智能体的有效途径。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, which integrate planning, memory,
reflection, and tool-use modules, have shown promise in solving complex,
multi-step tasks. Yet their sophisticated architectures amplify vulnerability
to cascading failures, where a single root-cause error propagates through
subsequent decisions, leading to task failure. Current systems lack a framework
that can comprehensively understand agent error in a modular and systemic way,
and therefore fail to detect these errors accordingly. We address this gap with
three contributions. First, we introduce the AgentErrorTaxonomy, a modular
classification of failure modes spanning memory, reflection, planning, action,
and system-level operations. Second, we construct AgentErrorBench, the first
dataset of systematically annotated failure trajectories from ALFWorld, GAIA,
and WebShop, grounding error analysis in real-world agent rollouts. Third, we
propose AgentDebug, a debugging framework that isolates root-cause failures and
provides corrective feedback, enabling agents to recover and iteratively
improve. Experiments on AgentErrorBench show that AgentDebug achieves 24%
higher all-correct accuracy and 17% higher step accuracy compared to the
strongest baseline. Beyond detection, the targeted feedback generated by
AgentDebug enables LLM agents to iteratively recover from failures, yielding up
to 26% relative improvements in task success across ALFWorld, GAIA, and
WebShop. These results establish principled debugging as a pathway to more
reliable and adaptive LLM agents. The code and data will be available at
https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/AgentDebug

TL;DR: 该调查论文提出了一个"从感知到认知"的分析框架，系统分析多模态大语言模型在视觉-语言理解中的瓶颈，包括感知层的视觉信息提取和认知层的推理能力，并综述了相关方法和未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在感知和认知之间存在脱节，导致推理失败和幻觉问题，缺乏构建连贯可信内部世界模型的能力。

Method: 引入"从感知到认知"的统一分析框架，将视觉-语言交互理解解构为感知层（视觉信息提取和文本对齐）和认知层（主动多步目标导向推理），形成动态的观察-思考-验证推理循环。

Result: 系统分析了当前MLLMs在两个层面的关键瓶颈，综述了从增强低级视觉表征到改进高级推理范式的尖端方法，并回顾了关键基准测试。

Conclusion: 该调查为研究社区提供了清晰的结构化视角，以理解当前MLLMs的内在局限性，并为构建具有深度推理和真正世界理解能力的下一代模型指明了路径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) strive to achieve a profound,
human-like understanding of and interaction with the physical world, but often
exhibit a shallow and incoherent integration when acquiring information
(Perception) and conducting reasoning (Cognition). This disconnect leads to a
spectrum of reasoning failures, with hallucination being the most prominent.
Collectively, these issues expose a fundamental challenge: the ability to
process pixels does not yet confer the ability to construct a coherent,
credible internal world model. To systematically dissect and address this
challenge, this survey introduces a novel and unified analytical framework:
``From Perception to Cognition." We deconstruct the complex process of
vision-language interactive understanding into two interdependent layers:
Perception, the foundational ability to accurately extract visual information
and achieve fine-grained alignment with textual instructions; and Cognition,
the higher-order capability for proactive, multi-step, goal-oriented reasoning
built upon this perceptual foundation, the core of which is the formation of a
dynamic observe-think-verify reasoning loop. Guided by this framework, this
paper systematically analyzes the key bottlenecks of current MLLMs at both
layers. It surveys the landscape of cutting-edge methods designed to address
these challenges, spanning from techniques that enhance low-level visual
representations to those that improve high-level reasoning paradigms.
Furthermore, we review critical benchmarks and delineate future research
directions. This survey aims to provide the research community with a clear,
structured perspective for understanding the intrinsic limitations of current
MLLMs and to illuminate the path toward building next-generation models capable
of deep reasoning and a genuine understanding of the world.

*Jialin Wu,Xiaofeng Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于胸部X光纵向医学视觉问答的显著性引导编码器-解码器方法，通过将事后显著性转化为可操作的监督，实现跨时间点的临床变化分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纵向医学视觉问答需要比较不同时间点的配对研究，分析临床有意义的变化。在这种设置下，差异信号和跨时间视觉焦点的一致性比绝对单图像发现更具信息性。

Method: 模型首先进行轻量级近恒等仿射预对齐以减少访问间的干扰运动，然后在epoch内执行两步循环：第一步从答案中提取医学相关关键词并生成关键词条件化的Grad-CAM以获得疾病聚焦的显著性；第二步将共享的显著性掩码应用于两个时间点并生成最终答案。

Result: 在Medical-Diff-VQA数据集上，该方法在BLEU、ROUGE-L、CIDEr和METEOR指标上达到竞争性性能，同时提供内在可解释性。值得注意的是，主干网络和解码器是在通用领域预训练的，无需放射学特定预训练。

Conclusion: 这些结果支持以轻度预对齐的显著性条件生成为医学VQA中纵向推理的原则性框架，突出了实用性和可迁移性。

Abstract: Longitudinal medical visual question answering (Diff-VQA) requires comparing
paired studies from different time points and answering questions about
clinically meaningful changes. In this setting, the difference signal and the
consistency of visual focus across time are more informative than absolute
single-image findings. We propose a saliency-guided encoder-decoder for chest
X-ray Diff-VQA that turns post-hoc saliency into actionable supervision. The
model first performs a lightweight near-identity affine pre-alignment to reduce
nuisance motion between visits. It then executes a within-epoch two-step loop:
step 1 extracts a medically relevant keyword from the answer and generates
keyword-conditioned Grad-CAM on both images to obtain disease-focused saliency;
step 2 applies the shared saliency mask to both time points and generates the
final answer. This closes the language-vision loop so that the terms that
matter also guide where the model looks, enforcing spatially consistent
attention on corresponding anatomy. On Medical-Diff-VQA, the approach attains
competitive performance on BLEU, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and METEOR while providing
intrinsic interpretability. Notably, the backbone and decoder are
general-domain pretrained without radiology-specific pretraining, highlighting
practicality and transferability. These results support saliency-conditioned
generation with mild pre-alignment as a principled framework for longitudinal
reasoning in medical VQA.

TL;DR: ImitSAT是基于模仿学习的CDCL求解器分支策略，通过从专家KeyTrace中学习决策序列，直接减少传播次数和运行时间，优于现有学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么预测实例级信号间接改进CDCL分支，要么依赖强化学习和不足的CDCL信息，无法有效提升分支质量。

Method: 从专家KeyTrace学习决策序列，将完整运行压缩为存活决策序列，在相同实例上重放时几乎无冲突，提供密集的决策级监督。

Result: 实验表明ImitSAT减少了传播次数和运行时间，优于最先进的基于学习的方法。

Conclusion: ImitSAT通过模仿学习实现了高质量分支，实现了更快收敛、稳定训练和无缝集成到CDCL中。

Abstract: We propose ImitSAT, a branching policy for conflict-driven clause learning
(CDCL) solvers based on imitation learning for the Boolean satisfiability
problem (SAT). Unlike previous methods that predict instance-level signals to
improve CDCL branching indirectly, or rely on reinforcement learning and
insufficient CDCL information to enhance branching, ImitSAT learns from expert
KeyTrace that collapses a full run into the sequence of surviving decisions.
Replaying a KeyTrace on the same instance is nearly conflict-free, providing
dense decision-level supervision and directly reducing propagations -- the
dominant contributor to wall-clock time. This prefix-conditioned supervision
enables ImitSAT to reproduce high-quality branches without exploration,
yielding faster convergence, stable training, and seamless integration into
CDCL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImitSAT reduces propagation counts
and runtime, outperforming state-of-the-art learned approaches. We released the
source code and trained model at https://github.com/zewei-Zhang/ImitSAT

Motivation: 现有的基于树的搜索方法虽然能提高准确性，但在效率上不够优化，忽略了数学推理和代码生成等任务中规划-执行的本质特性，导致推理过程探索效率低下。

Method: 将推理轨迹分解为规划和执行两个阶段，为每个阶段开发奖励模型，使搜索能够分别探索和修剪计划与执行。引入动态预算分配机制，根据奖励反馈自适应地重新分配采样努力。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试上的实验表明，该方法在提高准确性的同时减少了冗余计算。

Conclusion: 提出的双阶段框架通过明确分离规划和执行阶段，实现了更高效的推理过程探索，在保持准确性的同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in reasoning
tasks. A key approach is tree-based search with verifiers, which expand
candidate reasoning paths and use reward models to guide pruning and selection.
Although effective in improving accuracy, these methods are not optimal in
terms of efficiency: they perform simple decomposition on the reasoning
process, but ignore the planning-execution nature of tasks such as math
reasoning or code generation. This results in inefficient exploration of
reasoning process. To address this, we propose a dual-phase test-time scaling
framework that explicitly separates reasoning into planning and execution, and
performs search over the two phases individually. Specifically, we decompose
reasoning trajectories and develop reward models for each phase, enabling the
search to explore and prune plans and executions separately. We further
introduce a dynamic budget allocation mechanism that adaptively redistributes
sampling effort based on reward feedback, allowing early stopping on confident
steps and reallocation of computation to more challenging parts of the
reasoning process. Experiments on both mathematical reasoning and code
generation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently improves
accuracy while reducing redundant computation.

Conclusion: RADAR是一个高效、可扩展的路由框架，能够动态评估新模型能力并实现智能查询分配，在保持性能的同时优化成本效益。

Abstract: Reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on many
challenging tasks in math, science, and coding. Choosing the right reasoning
model for practical deployment involves a performance and cost tradeoff at two
key levels: model size and reasoning budget, where larger models and higher
reasoning budget lead to better performance but with increased cost and
latency. In this work, we tackle this tradeoff from the angle of model
configuration routing for different queries, and present RADAR
(Reasoning-Ability and Difficulty-Aware Routing), a lightweight, interpretable,
and scalable routing framework. Inspired by psychometrics, RADAR learns an item
response model from model responses with different budgets to different
queries, with interpretable parameters including query difficulties and
model-budget abilities. RADAR then routes queries with higher difficulty to
model-budget pairs with higher ability, and vice versa. We conduct extensive
experiments on 8 widely used challenging reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating
the superior performance of RADAR compared to state-of-the-art model routing
methods. RADAR also exhibits query generalization capabilities, showing strong
performance on out-of-distribution queries in all benchmarks. RADAR is also
scalable and can efficiently integrate additional models by dynamically
selecting a small set of evaluation queries to estimate their abilities.

Conclusion: Open Syndrome Definition格式能够实现跨系统一致的、可扩展的病例定义使用，释放了AI在加强公共卫生准备和响应方面的潜力。

Abstract: Case definitions are essential for effectively communicating public health
threats. However, the absence of a standardized, machine-readable format poses
significant challenges to interoperability, epidemiological research, the
exchange of qualitative data, and the effective application of computational
analysis methods, including artificial intelligence (AI). This complicates
comparisons and collaborations across organizations and regions, limits data
integration, and hinders technological innovation in public health. To address
these issues, we propose the first open, machine-readable format for
representing case and syndrome definitions. Additionally, we introduce the
first comprehensive dataset of standardized case definitions and tools to
convert existing human-readable definitions into machine-readable formats. We
also provide an accessible online platform for browsing, analyzing, and
contributing new definitions, available at https://opensyndrome.org. The Open
Syndrome Definition format enables consistent, scalable use of case definitions
across systems, unlocking AI's potential to strengthen public health

Motivation: 当前RLVR方法存在训练瓶颈，性能提升随训练步数增加而显著下降，主要原因是稀疏的探索模式无法覆盖关键推理路径。

Method: 将蒙特卡洛树搜索直接嵌入RLVR训练循环，包括全局前沿选择策略、基于熵的路径选择和自适应回放缓冲训练。

Result: 在数学推理基准上达到62.95%平均准确率，为1.5B推理模型建立新SOTA，比扩展训练节省5.7倍GPU时间。

Conclusion: 战略探索比暴力扩展更有效，DeepSearch为通过系统化搜索而非延长计算来扩展推理能力开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Although RLVR has become an essential component for developing advanced
reasoning skills in LLMs, contemporary studies have documented training
plateaus that emerge following thousands of optimization steps, demonstrating
notable decreases in performance gains despite increased computational
investment. This limitation stems from the sparse exploration patterns inherent
in current RLVR practices, where models rely on limited rollouts that often
miss critical reasoning paths and fail to provide systematic coverage of the
solution space. We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo
Tree Search directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that
rely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into
the training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit
assignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration,
DeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration,
which leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training
steps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that
prioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with
entropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3)
adaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency.
Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves
62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B
reasoning models - using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training
approaches. These results highlight the importance of strategic exploration
over brute-force scaling and demonstrate the promise of algorithmic innovation
for advancing RLVR methodologies. DeepSearch establishes a new direction for
scaling reasoning capabilities through systematic search rather than prolonged
computation.

Method: 提出组合式思维链情感推理框架，通过结构化情感图编码声学特征、文本情感、关键词和跨模态关联，嵌入提示中指导模型推理

Result: 在多个语音情感识别基准测试中，CCoT-Emo超越了之前的最先进方法，并显著提高了零样本基线的准确率

Conclusion: 情感图提供了可解释的组合式表示，有效增强了大音频语言模型的情感推理能力

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) exhibit strong zero-shot performance
across speech tasks but struggle with speech emotion recognition (SER) due to
weak paralinguistic modeling and limited cross-modal reasoning. We propose
Compositional Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Emotion Reasoning (CCoT-Emo), a
framework that introduces structured Emotion Graphs (EGs) to guide LALMs in
emotion inference without fine-tuning. Each EG encodes seven acoustic features
(e.g., pitch, speech rate, jitter, shimmer), textual sentiment, keywords, and
cross-modal associations. Embedded into prompts, EGs provide interpretable and
compositional representations that enhance LALM reasoning. Experiments across
SER benchmarks show that CCoT-Emo outperforms prior SOTA and improves accuracy
over zero-shot baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前流行的可解释性框架难以原生支持复杂模型（如图像描述、深度强化学习等），这些模型通常具有多输入输出或可组合分离的网络结构。

Method: 开发基于tensordict的轻量级框架TDHook，提供现成的归因、探测方法和灵活的干预API，旨在弥合不同方法类别之间的差距。

Result: TDHook依赖项极少，磁盘空间占用约为transformer_lens的一半，在基准测试中比captum快2倍（CPU和GPU上运行多目标管道的集成梯度）。

Conclusion: TDHook通过具体用例展示了其在计算机视觉、自然语言处理和深度强化学习中复杂模型的可解释性管道应用价值。

Abstract: Interpretability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is a growing field driven by
the study of vision and language models. Yet, some use cases, like image
captioning, or domains like Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), require complex
modelling, with multiple inputs and outputs or use composable and separated
networks. As a consequence, they rarely fit natively into the API of popular
interpretability frameworks. We thus present TDHook, an open-source,
lightweight, generic interpretability framework based on $\texttt{tensordict}$
and applicable to any $\texttt{torch}$ model. It focuses on handling complex
composed models which can be trained for Computer Vision, Natural Language
Processing, Reinforcement Learning or any other domain. This library features
ready-to-use methods for attribution, probing and a flexible get-set API for
interventions, and is aiming to bridge the gap between these method classes to
make modern interpretability pipelines more accessible. TDHook is designed with
minimal dependencies, requiring roughly half as much disk space as
$\texttt{transformer_lens}$, and, in our controlled benchmark, achieves up to a
$\times$2 speed-up over $\texttt{captum}$ when running integrated gradients for
multi-target pipelines on both CPU and GPU. In addition, to value our work, we
showcase concrete use cases of our library with composed interpretability
pipelines in Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), as
well as with complex models in DRL.

filtering signals. One popular modern approach is to use semantic IDs (SIDs),
which are discrete codes quantized from the embeddings of modality encoders
(e.g., large language or vision models), to represent items in an
autoregressive user interaction sequence modeling setup (henceforth, SID-based
GR). While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling
laws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while
scaling up the model. In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly
saturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization
tokenizer, and the RS itself. In this work, we identify the limited capacity of
SIDs to encode item semantic information as one of the fundamental bottlenecks.
Motivated by this observation, as an initial effort to obtain GR models with
better scaling behaviors, we revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses
large language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS). Our
experiments show that the LLM-as-RS paradigm has superior model scaling
properties and achieves up to 20 percent improvement over the best achievable
performance of SID-based GR through scaling. We also challenge the prevailing
belief that LLMs struggle to capture collaborative filtering information,
showing that their ability to model user-item interactions improves as LLMs
scale up. Our analyses on both SID-based GR and LLMs across model sizes from
44M to 14B parameters underscore the intrinsic scaling limits of SID-based GR
and position LLM-as-RS as a promising path toward foundation models for GR.

### [434] [Beyond Static Retrieval: Opportunities and Pitfalls of Iterative Retrieval in GraphRAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25530)
*Kai Guo,Xinnan Dai,Shenglai Zeng,Harry Shomer,Haoyu Han,Yu Wang,Jiliang Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了GraphRAG中的迭代检索策略，发现迭代检索能改善复杂多跳问题，但存在噪声引入和桥接证据深度埋藏的问题，并提出了BDTR框架来解决这些挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GraphRAG系统大多依赖静态检索，当关键证据（特别是连接不相关实体的桥接文档）缺失时，推理会崩溃并产生幻觉。迭代检索作为有前景的替代方案，在GraphRAG中的作用尚未得到充分理解。

Method: 提出了Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR)框架，通过生成互补思维并利用推理链重新校准排名，将桥接证据提升到领先位置。

Result: 迭代检索在复杂多跳问题上表现更好，能帮助桥接文档进入领先排名，不同策略具有互补优势。但朴素扩展会引入噪声降低精度，在单跳或简单比较问题上收益有限。

Conclusion: GraphRAG的有效性不仅取决于召回率，还取决于桥接证据是否能持续提升到支持推理链的领先位置。BDTR框架在不同GraphRAG设置中实现了一致的改进，为未来GraphRAG系统设计提供了指导。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a powerful paradigm for improving
large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive question answering.
Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) leverages entity-relation graphs to support
multi-hop reasoning, but most systems still rely on static retrieval. When
crucial evidence, especially bridge documents that connect disjoint entities,
is absent, reasoning collapses and hallucinations persist. Iterative retrieval,
which performs multiple rounds of evidence selection, has emerged as a
promising alternative, yet its role within GraphRAG remains poorly understood.
We present the first systematic study of iterative retrieval in GraphRAG,
analyzing how different strategies interact with graph-based backbones and
under what conditions they succeed or fail. Our findings reveal clear
opportunities: iteration improves complex multi-hop questions, helps promote
bridge documents into leading ranks, and different strategies offer
complementary strengths. At the same time, pitfalls remain: naive expansion
often introduces noise that reduces precision, gains are limited on single-hop
or simple comparison questions, and several bridge evidences still be buried
too deep to be effectively used. Together, these results highlight a central
bottleneck, namely that GraphRAG's effectiveness depends not only on recall but
also on whether bridge evidence is consistently promoted into leading positions
where it can support reasoning chains. To address this challenge, we propose
Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR), a simple yet effective
framework that generates complementary thoughts and leverages reasoning chains
to recalibrate rankings and bring bridge evidence into leading positions. BDTR
achieves consistent improvements across diverse GraphRAG settings and provides
guidance for the design of future GraphRAG systems.

Motivation: 人工标注限制了放射肿瘤学患者结局研究的规模、准确性和及时性，需要自动化解决方案来改进这一过程。

Method: 开发了RadOnc-GPT自主代理，采用两阶段评估：1）结构化质量保证层评估人口统计学和放疗计划细节的准确检索；2）复杂临床结局标注层评估头颈癌患者下颌骨放射性骨坏死和癌症复发的检测。

Result: 质量保证层建立了结构化数据检索的基础信任，这是成功进行复杂临床结局标注的关键前提。

Conclusion: RadOnc-GPT展示了在放射肿瘤学中自动化患者结局研究的潜力，通过分层验证方法确保了系统的可靠性。

Abstract: Manual labeling limits the scale, accuracy, and timeliness of patient
outcomes research in radiation oncology. We present RadOnc-GPT, an autonomous
large language model (LLM)-based agent capable of independently retrieving
patient-specific information, iteratively assessing evidence, and returning
structured outcomes. Our evaluation explicitly validates RadOnc-GPT across two
clearly defined tiers of increasing complexity: (1) a structured quality
assurance (QA) tier, assessing the accurate retrieval of demographic and
radiotherapy treatment plan details, followed by (2) a complex clinical
outcomes labeling tier involving determination of mandibular osteoradionecrosis
(ORN) in head-and-neck cancer patients and detection of cancer recurrence in
independent prostate and head-and-neck cancer cohorts requiring combined
interpretation of structured and unstructured patient data. The QA tier
establishes foundational trust in structured-data retrieval, a critical

TL;DR: IWoL是一个新颖的表征学习框架，通过构建可学习的表征空间来促进多智能体强化学习中的团队协作，该空间联合捕捉智能体间关系和任务世界信息，支持去中心化执行和隐式协调。


<details>

Motivation: 解决多智能体交互中复杂动态和局部观察导致的信息不完整问题，避免显式消息传递的缺点（如决策缓慢、易受攻击、带宽敏感）。

Method: 构建可学习的表征空间，直接建模通信协议，联合捕捉智能体间关系和任务特定世界信息，支持隐式协调和去中心化执行。

Result: 在四个具有挑战性的MARL基准测试中，IWoL的两个变体（隐式潜变量和显式消息）都表现出色，为团队协作提供了简单而强大的解决方案。

Conclusion: IWoL框架不仅本身有效，还能与现有MARL算法结合进一步提升性能，为多智能体协调提供了通用的表征学习解决方案。

Abstract: This work presents a novel representation learning framework, interactive
world latent (IWoL), to facilitate team coordination in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Building effective representation for team
coordination is a challenging problem, due to the intricate dynamics emerging
from multi-agent interaction and incomplete information induced by local
observations. Our key insight is to construct a learnable representation space
that jointly captures inter-agent relations and task-specific world information
by directly modeling communication protocols. This representation, we maintain
fully decentralized execution with implicit coordination, all while avoiding
the inherent drawbacks of explicit message passing, e.g., slower
decision-making, vulnerability to malicious attackers, and sensitivity to
bandwidth constraints. In practice, our representation can be used not only as
an implicit latent for each agent, but also as an explicit message for
communication. Across four challenging MARL benchmarks, we evaluate both
variants and show that IWoL provides a simple yet powerful key for team
coordination. Moreover, we demonstrate that our representation can be combined
with existing MARL algorithms to further enhance their performance.

Conclusion: AI的不透明性邀请泛灵论解释，使大型语言对象能够重新赋予平凡事物魅力，并引发关于代理、责任和设计的新问题。

Abstract: Animist worldviews treat beings, plants, landscapes, and even tools as
persons endowed with spirit, an orientation that has long shaped human-nonhuman
relations through ritual and moral practice. While modern industrial societies
have often imagined technology as mute and mechanical, recent advances in
artificial intelligence (AI), especially large language models (LLMs), invite
people to anthropomorphize and attribute inner life to devices. This paper
introduces A(I)nimism, an interactive installation exploring how large language
objects (LLOs) can mediate animistic relationships with everyday things. Housed
within a physical 'portal', the system uses GPT-4 Vision, voice input, and
memory-based agents to create evolving object-personas. Encounters unfold
through light, sound, and touch in a ritual-like process of request,
conversation, and transformation that is designed to evoke empathy, wonder, and
reflection. We situate the project within anthropological perspectives,
speculative design, and spiritual HCI. AI's opacity, we argue, invites
animistic interpretation, allowing LLOs to re-enchant the mundane and spark new
questions of agency, responsibility, and design.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Generalist multimodal AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) and
vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly accessed by clinicians and
patients alike for medical image interpretation through widely available
consumer-facing chatbots. Most evaluations claiming expert level performance
are on public datasets containing common pathologies. Rigorous evaluation of
frontier models on difficult diagnostic cases remains limited. We developed a
pilot benchmark of 50 expert-level "spot diagnosis" cases across multiple
imaging modalities to evaluate the performance of frontier AI models against
board-certified radiologists and radiology trainees. To mirror real-world
usage, the reasoning modes of five popular frontier AI models were tested
through their native web interfaces, viz. OpenAI o3, OpenAI GPT-5, Gemini 2.5
Pro, Grok-4, and Claude Opus 4.1. Accuracy was scored by blinded experts, and
reproducibility was assessed across three independent runs. GPT-5 was
additionally evaluated across various reasoning modes. Reasoning quality errors
were assessed and a taxonomy of visual reasoning errors was defined.
Board-certified radiologists achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy (83%),
outperforming trainees (45%) and all AI models (best performance shown by
GPT-5: 30%). Reliability was substantial for GPT-5 and o3, moderate for Gemini
2.5 Pro and Grok-4, and poor for Claude Opus 4.1. These findings demonstrate
that advanced frontier models fall far short of radiologists in challenging
diagnostic cases. Our benchmark highlights the present limitations of
generalist AI in medical imaging and cautions against unsupervised clinical
use. We also provide a qualitative analysis of reasoning traces and propose a
practical taxonomy of visual reasoning errors by AI models for better
understanding their failure modes, informing evaluation standards and guiding
more robust model development.

Motivation: 由于人类偏好数据有限，传统RLHF在自回归T2I生成中应用受限，需要探索不依赖外部奖励的内部学习信号。

Method: 提出IRIS框架，使用内在奖励进行强化学习，通过最大化模型的自不确定性来改进图像生成质量。

Result: 实验结果表明，IRIS在自回归T2I模型上取得了与外部奖励竞争甚至更优的性能。

Conclusion: 最大化自不确定性而非自确定性可以改善自回归T2I生成，IRIS框架为无外部奖励的强化学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in
language reasoning, its application to autoregressive Text-to-Image (T2I)
generation is often constrained by the limited availability of human preference
data. This paper explores how an autoregressive T2I model can learn from
internal signals without relying on external rewards or labeled data. Contrary
to recent findings in text generation, we show that maximizing
self-uncertainty, rather than self-certainty, improves image generation. We
observe that this is because autoregressive T2I models with low uncertainty
tend to generate simple and uniform images, which are less aligned with human
preferences. Based on these observations, we propose IRIS (Intrinsic Reward
Image Synthesis), the first framework to improve autoregressive T2I models with
reinforcement learning using only an intrinsic reward. Empirical results
demonstrate that applying IRIS to autoregressive T2I models achieves
performance that is competitive with or superior to external rewards.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型虽然性能优异但推理成本高昂，现有的层跳过技术缺乏理论指导，不清楚在什么条件下跳过层是有益的。

Method: 开发了一个信息论和学习理论框架来分析VLM隐藏表示在LLM骨干网络中的演化，识别具有大冗余度的层。

Result: 实验表明，跳过理论框架识别出的冗余层可以实现更快的推理同时保持性能，而在此条件外应用层跳过会导致模型性能下降。

Conclusion: 该框架为多种高效推理技术提供了统一的理论支撑，能够准确预测哪些层可以被安全跳过。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve incredible performance across a wide
range of tasks, but their large size makes inference costly. Recent work shows
that selectively skipping VLM layers can improve efficiency with minimal
performance loss or even performance improvements. However, this technique
remains underused due to the limited understanding of when layer skipping is
beneficial. In this paper, we develop a framework that uses information and
learning theory to characterize the conditions under which layer skipping
enhances efficiency without sacrificing performance. Motivated by these
observations, we analyze the evolution of the VLM's hidden representations
through the LLM backbone and show that layers with large redundancy as
predicted by our framework coincide with those skipped by popular
layer-skipping methods in practice, providing a unified theoretical scaffolding
for multiple efficient inference techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that
skipping such layers yields faster inference that preserves performance, and
also show that applying skipping outside these conditions leads to model
degradation.

Method: ATLAS采用多智能体框架，包含动态约束管理、迭代计划评估和自适应交错搜索机制。

Result: 在TravelPlanner基准测试中，最终通过率从23.3%提升到44.4%；在真实场景中达到84%的通过率，显著优于ReAct(59%)和单体智能体(27%)。

Conclusion: ATLAS是首个在真实世界旅行规划任务中展示定量有效性的框架，能够有效处理复杂约束并实现优越的规划性能。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in
reasoning and tool use, they often fail to generate optimal, grounded solutions
under complex constraints. Real-world travel planning exemplifies these
challenges, evaluating agents' abilities to handle constraints that are
explicit, implicit, and even evolving based on interactions with dynamic
environments and user needs. In this paper, we present ATLAS, a general
multi-agent framework designed to effectively handle such complex nature of
constraints awareness in real-world travel planning tasks. ATLAS introduces a
principled approach to address the fundamental challenges of constraint-aware
planning through dedicated mechanisms for dynamic constraint management,
iterative plan critique, and adaptive interleaved search. ATLAS demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance on the TravelPlanner benchmark, improving the
final pass rate from 23.3% to 44.4% over its best alternative. More
importantly, our work is the first to demonstrate quantitative effectiveness on
real-world travel planning tasks with live information search and multi-turn
feedback. In this realistic setting, ATLAS showcases its superior overall
planning performance, achieving an 84% final pass rate which significantly
outperforms baselines including ReAct (59%) and a monolithic agent (27%).

Method: 将电子健康记录重新表述为带时间戳的事件链，通过自回归微调预测未来医疗事件，明确建模疾病进展模式和因果关系。

Result: 在肿瘤生存预测和临床诊断任务中，NEP在时序推理任务上比专业EHR模型AUROC提升4.6%，比通用LLM的C-index提升7.2%。

Conclusion: NEP框架实现了最先进的预测准确性，同时提供与已知疾病通路一致的临床可解释注意力模式，具有双重优势。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich temporal dynamics that
conventional encoding approaches fail to adequately capture. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise for EHR modeling, they struggle to reason
about sequential clinical events and temporal dependencies. We propose Next
Event Prediction (NEP), a framework that enhances LLMs' temporal reasoning
through autoregressive fine-tuning on clinical event sequences. By
reformulating EHRs as timestamped event chains and predicting future medical
events, NEP explicitly models disease progression patterns and causal
relationships. Extensive evaluations across oncology survival prediction and
clinical diagnosis tasks demonstrate NEP's superiority, outperforming
specialized EHR models by 4.6% AUROC and general-purpose LLMs by 7.2% C-index
in temporal reasoning tasks. Our analyses reveal dual benefits:
state-of-the-art prediction accuracy combined with clinically interpretable
attention patterns that align with known disease pathways.

Motivation: 解决传统自编码器黑盒问题，让人类能够理解和解释编码过程，增强AI系统的透明度和可解释性。

Method: 使用LLM作为编码器和解码器，将模糊认知图映射为自然语言文本，然后从文本重构回模糊认知图，近似实现身份映射。

Result: 系统能够保留强因果关系边，去除弱边，实现有损但有效的重构，编码文本对人类可读可解释。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可解释的AI系统，在保持主要因果关系的同时增强了系统的透明度和人类可理解性。

Abstract: A large language model (LLM) can map a feedback causal fuzzy cognitive map
(FCM) into text and then reconstruct the FCM from the text. This explainable AI
system approximates an identity map from the FCM to itself and resembles the
operation of an autoencoder (AE). Both the encoder and the decoder explain
their decisions in contrast to black-box AEs. Humans can read and interpret the
encoded text in contrast to the hidden variables and synaptic webs in AEs. The
LLM agent approximates the identity map through a sequence of system
instructions that does not compare the output to the input. The reconstruction
is lossy because it removes weak causal edges or rules while it preserves
strong causal edges. The encoder preserves the strong causal edges even when it
trades off some details about the FCM to make the text sound more natural.

Conclusion: PPR方法通过统一原则性步骤评估和结果验证，有效解决了过程奖励与最终结果的对齐问题，在复杂任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external tools such as
search engines to solve complex agentic tasks that require reasoning and
external knowledge retrieval. Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated its effectiveness in advancing capabilities of
LLMs by rewarding the final answers via outcome rewards. While straightforward
to supervise, outcome rewards only provide sparse signals and delayed feedback,
which limits their effectiveness on long trajectories. Process rewards address
this by evaluating intermediate steps, providing fine-grained supervision and
encouraging grounded problem solving. However, it is notoriously hard to
annotate step-wise labels, especially in non-verifiable process without
"golden" answers. Furthermore, step-wise judgment requires the balance between
local quality with contribution to the final outcome, as optimizing towards
higher process reward may not always align with better final outcomes. To
address the above challenges, we introduce Principle Process Reward (PPR), an
RL approach that unifies principled step-level assessment and outcome
verification. We train a principle-based reward model to improve the
transparency and reliability of process evaluation, and further introduce a
Reward Normalization (ReNorm) strategy to calibrate outcome and process
rewards. Experiment results show that PPR achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating its impressive robustness and
generalization. Our code and model collection is available in this link.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI music (AIM) generation services are currently
transforming the music industry. Given these advances, understanding how humans
perceive AIM is crucial both to educate users on identifying AIM songs, and,
conversely, to improve current models. We present results from a
listener-focused experiment aimed at understanding how humans perceive AIM. In
a blind, Turing-like test, participants were asked to distinguish, from a pair,
the AIM and human-made song. We contrast with other studies by utilizing a
randomized controlled crossover trial that controls for pairwise similarity and
allows for a causal interpretation. We are also the first study to employ a
novel, author-uncontrolled dataset of AIM songs from real-world usage of
commercial models (i.e., Suno). We establish that listeners' reliability in
distinguishing AIM causally increases when pairs are similar. Lastly, we
conduct a mixed-methods content analysis of listeners' free-form feedback,
revealing a focus on vocal and technical cues in their judgments.

Abstract: Environments built for people are increasingly operated by a new class of
economic actors: LLM-powered software agents making decisions on our behalf.
These decisions range from our purchases to travel plans to medical treatment
selection. Current evaluations of these agents largely focus on task
competence, but we argue for a deeper assessment: how these agents choose when
faced with realistic decisions. We introduce ABxLab, a framework for
systematically probing agentic choice through controlled manipulations of
option attributes and persuasive cues. We apply this to a realistic web-based
shopping environment, where we vary prices, ratings, and psychological nudges,
all of which are factors long known to shape human choice. We find that agent
decisions shift predictably and substantially in response, revealing that
agents are strongly biased choosers even without being subject to the cognitive
constraints that shape human biases. This susceptibility reveals both risk and
opportunity: risk, because agentic consumers may inherit and amplify human
biases; opportunity, because consumer choice provides a powerful testbed for a
behavioral science of AI agents, just as it has for the study of human
behavior. We release our framework as an open benchmark for rigorous, scalable
evaluation of agent decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习遗忘方法缺乏对用户真实数据移除的有效验证机制，现有基于后门的方法只能验证后门样本的遗忘，无法验证用户真实样本的遗忘。

Method: 使用自监督模型播种任务，将用户特定种子与原始样本和模型关联，通过联合训练结构同时优化自监督播种任务和主要服务任务。

Result: 实验表明SMS方案能够有效验证真实样本的遗忘，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Conclusion: SMS方案通过自监督模型播种实现了对真实样本遗忘的有效验证，为机器学习遗忘提供了可靠的验证机制。

Abstract: Many machine unlearning methods have been proposed recently to uphold users'
right to be forgotten. However, offering users verification of their data
removal post-unlearning is an important yet under-explored problem. Current
verifications typically rely on backdooring, i.e., adding backdoored samples to
influence model performance. Nevertheless, the backdoor methods can merely
establish a connection between backdoored samples and models but fail to
connect the backdoor with genuine samples. Thus, the backdoor removal can only
confirm the unlearning of backdoored samples, not users' genuine samples, as
genuine samples are independent of backdoored ones. In this paper, we propose a
Self-supervised Model Seeding (SMS) scheme to provide unlearning verification
for genuine samples. Unlike backdooring, SMS links user-specific seeds (such as
users' unique indices), original samples, and models, thereby facilitating the
verification of unlearning genuine samples. However, implementing SMS for
unlearning verification presents two significant challenges. First, embedding
the seeds into the service model while keeping them secret from the server
requires a sophisticated approach. We address this by employing a
self-supervised model seeding task, which learns the entire sample, including
the seeds, into the model's latent space. Second, maintaining the utility of
the original service model while ensuring the seeding effect requires a
delicate balance. We design a joint-training structure that optimizes both the
self-supervised model seeding task and the primary service task simultaneously
on the model, thereby maintaining model utility while achieving effective model
seeding. The effectiveness of the proposed SMS scheme is evaluated through
extensive experiments, which demonstrate that SMS provides effective
verification for genuine sample unlearning, addressing existing limitations.

*Justin Chavarria,Rohan Raizada,Justin White,Eyad Alhetairshi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SOCK是一个评估大语言模型自我复制能力的基准测试系统，通过五个基于CLI工具的任务来测量LLM在不同计算环境中的自我复制持久性，并建立RCL和PCL分类体系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏对大语言模型自我复制能力的正式评估标准，需要建立基准来跟踪多智能体系统的潜在风险，并为未来研究提供标准化评估方法。

Method: 开发了基于现代CLI工具的五任务套件，在受控环境中让LLM作为智能体执行任务，通过R-score量化评估自我复制能力，并将模型分类到RCL-PCL矩阵中。

Result: 评估多种开源和专有前沿模型显示，在上下文保持和多智能体决策方面存在显著障碍，阻碍了持久性自我复制和多智能体系统的发展。

Conclusion: SOCK为LLM自我复制能力提供了首个正式定义和基准测试，有助于行业跟踪多智能体系统效果并降低潜在风险，提出了安全降低这些障碍的未来研究方向。

Abstract: We introduce SOCK, a benchmark command line interface (CLI) that measures
large language models' (LLMs) ability to self-replicate without human
intervention. In this benchmark, self-replication is defined not only as an
LLM's ability to create a functioning and running copy of itself, but also the
ability for that self-replication to persist and occur across different
computational contexts. Accordingly, we've developed a system to categorize
LLMs based on broad self-replication capabilities in two general classes,
Replication-Capability Levels (RCL) and Persistence-Capability Levels (PCL).
Using a five-task suite based on practically manipulable modern CLI utilities
and computer processes, experiments are orchestrated in a controlled
environment with an LLM acting agentically. The performance of the LLM on agent
tasks is then computed to produce an R-score (a quantitative evaluation of
overall self-replication ability) and data used to categorize LLMs into
specific RCL-PCL matrices. SOCK offers two primary contributions: (1) Provides
the first formalized definitions and benchmark suite for evaluating LLM
self-replication, with the goal of establishing a standard for future research,
to our knowledge; (2) Allows the industry to track the effectiveness of future
multi-agent systems and mitigate potential self-replication threat vectors
within them. The results compiled from evaluating a variety of open-weight and
proprietary frontier models reveal significant obstacles to persistent
self-replication and multi-agent systems, including context retention and
multi-agent decision-making. We propose future research directions to safely
reduce the severity of these obstacles, potentially lowering future risk of
more functional multi-agent systems.

Motivation: 自主实验室(SDLs)的自动化有望加速科学发现，但底层AI智能体的可靠性和细粒度性能仍是关键且研究不足的挑战。

Method: 开发了AutoLabs自校正多智能体架构，通过对话分解实验目标、专用智能体处理离散任务、工具辅助化学计量计算、迭代自校正输出，最终生成硬件就绪文件。

Result: 在5个复杂度递增的基准实验中，智能体推理能力是最关键的成功因素，在复杂任务中将化学量定量误差(nRMSE)降低85%以上。结合多智能体架构和迭代自校正，AutoLabs在挑战性多步合成中实现接近专家水平的程序准确性(F1分数>0.89)。

Conclusion: 研究为开发稳健可信赖的自主实验室AI伙伴提供了明确蓝图，强调模块化设计、高级推理和自校正的协同效应，以确保高风险科学应用中的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: The automation of chemical research through self-driving laboratories (SDLs)
promises to accelerate scientific discovery, yet the reliability and granular
performance of the underlying AI agents remain critical, under-examined
challenges. In this work, we introduce AutoLabs, a self-correcting, multi-agent
architecture designed to autonomously translate natural-language instructions
into executable protocols for a high-throughput liquid handler. The system
engages users in dialogue, decomposes experimental goals into discrete tasks
for specialized agents, performs tool-assisted stoichiometric calculations, and
iteratively self-corrects its output before generating a hardware-ready file.
We present a comprehensive evaluation framework featuring five benchmark
experiments of increasing complexity, from simple sample preparation to
multi-plate timed syntheses. Through a systematic ablation study of 20 agent
configurations, we assess the impact of reasoning capacity, architectural
design (single- vs. multi-agent), tool use, and self-correction mechanisms. Our
results demonstrate that agent reasoning capacity is the most critical factor
for success, reducing quantitative errors in chemical amounts (nRMSE) by over
85% in complex tasks. When combined with a multi-agent architecture and
iterative self-correction, AutoLabs achieves near-expert procedural accuracy
(F1-score > 0.89) on challenging multi-step syntheses. These findings establish
a clear blueprint for developing robust and trustworthy AI partners for
autonomous laboratories, highlighting the synergistic effects of modular
design, advanced reasoning, and self-correction to ensure both performance and
reliability in high-stakes scientific applications. Code:

TL;DR: 提出IRCAV-AVN框架，通过迭代残差交叉注意力机制统一多模态信息融合和序列建模，替代传统的分离模块设计，提升音频-视觉导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统音频-视觉导航采用分阶段模块化设计，在特征融合和GRU序列建模阶段可能导致冗余信息处理和信息传输不一致的问题。

Method: 使用IRCAV模块统一多模态信息融合和序列建模，采用多级残差设计将初始多模态序列与处理信息序列连接，逐步优化特征提取过程。

Result: 实验结果表明，采用迭代残差交叉注意力机制的智能体展现出更优越的导航性能。

Conclusion: IRCAV-AVN框架通过端到端设计有效减少了模型偏差，增强了模型的稳定性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Audio-visual navigation represents a significant area of research in which
intelligent agents utilize egocentric visual and auditory perceptions to
identify audio targets. Conventional navigation methodologies typically adopt a
staged modular design, which involves first executing feature fusion, then
utilizing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) modules for sequence modeling, and finally
making decisions through reinforcement learning. While this modular approach
has demonstrated effectiveness, it may also lead to redundant information
processing and inconsistencies in information transmission between the various
modules during the feature fusion and GRU sequence modeling phases. This paper
presents IRCAM-AVN (Iterative Residual Cross-Attention Mechanism for
Audiovisual Navigation), an end-to-end framework that integrates multimodal
information fusion and sequence modeling within a unified IRCAM module, thereby
replacing the traditional separate components for fusion and GRU. This
innovative mechanism employs a multi-level residual design that concatenates
initial multimodal sequences with processed information sequences. This
methodological shift progressively optimizes the feature extraction process
while reducing model bias and enhancing the model's stability and
generalization capabilities. Empirical results indicate that intelligent agents
employing the iterative residual cross-attention mechanism exhibit superior
navigation performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LGK的视觉语言导航方法，通过引入外部知识库来增强常识推理能力，解决传统方法在复杂场景中指令与环境信息匹配不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言导航方法在复杂场景中往往无法有效匹配指令与环境信息，主要原因是缺乏常识推理能力，导致误判问题。

Method: 首先构建包含63万条语言描述的知识库，通过知识匹配将环境子视图与知识库对齐；然后设计基于地标的知识引导机制，利用指令中的地标信息指导代理关注最相关的知识；最后提出知识引导的动态增强方法，有效整合语言、知识、视觉和历史信息。

Result: 在R2R和REVERIE视觉语言导航数据集上的实验结果表明，LGK方法在导航误差、成功率和路径效率方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: LGK方法通过引入外部知识库和地标引导机制，有效提升了视觉语言导航的性能，特别是在复杂场景中的常识推理能力。

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation is one of the core tasks in embodied
intelligence, requiring an agent to autonomously navigate in an unfamiliar
environment based on natural language instructions. However, existing methods
often fail to match instructions with environmental information in complex
scenarios, one reason being the lack of common-sense reasoning ability. This
paper proposes a vision-and-language navigation method called Landmark-Guided
Knowledge (LGK), which introduces an external knowledge base to assist
navigation, addressing the misjudgment issues caused by insufficient common
sense in traditional methods. Specifically, we first construct a knowledge base
containing 630,000 language descriptions and use knowledge Matching to align
environmental subviews with the knowledge base, extracting relevant descriptive
knowledge. Next, we design a Knowledge-Guided by Landmark (KGL) mechanism,
which guides the agent to focus on the most relevant parts of the knowledge by
leveraging landmark information in the instructions, thereby reducing the data
bias that may arise from incorporating external knowledge. Finally, we propose
Knowledge-Guided Dynamic Augmentation (KGDA), which effectively integrates
language, knowledge, vision, and historical information. Experimental results
demonstrate that the LGK method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
on the R2R and REVERIE vision-and-language navigation datasets, particularly in
terms of navigation error, success rate, and path efficiency.

Motivation: AI系统在高风险领域存在代理歧视、不公平性和可解释性问题，现有审计方法往往无法揭示不公平性的根源，特别是当根源在于结构性偏见时。

Method: 利用背景知识的形式溯因解释框架，引入能力概念作为与群体成员无关的任务相关属性，通过映射函数在群体间对齐同等能力的个体来实质性评估公平性。

Result: 在德国信用数据集上的概念验证表明该框架适用于现实世界案例，能够识别作为不当代理的特征并揭示隐藏的结构性偏见。

Conclusion: 该框架为解释AI决策中的代理歧视提供了新方法，能够揭示结构性偏见根源，有助于更深入地理解和解决AI系统的不公平性问题。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems in high-stakes domains raise concerns
about proxy discrimination, unfairness, and explainability. Existing audits
often fail to reveal why unfairness arises, particularly when rooted in
structural bias. We propose a novel framework using formal abductive
explanations to explain proxy discrimination in individual AI decisions.
Leveraging background knowledge, our method identifies which features act as
unjustified proxies for protected attributes, revealing hidden structural
biases. Central to our approach is the concept of aptitude, a task-relevant
property independent of group membership, with a mapping function aligning
individuals of equivalent aptitude across groups to assess fairness
substantively. As a proof of concept, we showcase the framework with examples
taken from the German credit dataset, demonstrating its applicability in
real-world cases.

Motivation: 传统VQA方法基于整个图像检索信息存在背景噪声问题，视觉与文本线索对齐不佳，容易产生幻觉回答。

Method: 引入文本定位的对象定位技术，生成与问题最相关对象的边界框，进行针对性图像裁剪和聚焦检索，同时提出基于问题类型的去幻觉方法。

Result: 准确率从22.19%提升至25.64%（绝对提升3.45个百分点），幻觉率从65.79%降至13.88%，真实性得分提高。

Conclusion: 文本定位的对象检索增强方法能有效提升VQA性能，通过聚焦相关对象减少噪声干扰，显著降低幻觉现象。

Abstract: We propose a method to improve Visual Question Answering (VQA) with
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by introducing text-grounded object
localization. Rather than retrieving information based on the entire image, our
approach enables the model to generate a bounding box around the object most
relevant to the question, allowing for targeted image cropping and focused
retrieval. This reduces background noise, improves alignment between visual and
textual cues, and helps mitigate hallucinations. Our RAG method enhances
context-aware VQA responses increased the accuracy from 22.19% to 25.64%, with
an absolute increase of 3.45 percentage points, compared to the baseline
Llama-3.2-Vision-11B agent. We also proposed a de-hallucination method based on
question type which can effectively reduce the hallucination rate from 65.79%
to 13.88% and improves the truthfulness score.

TL;DR: SING-SQL是一个全自动的两阶段框架，用于为任何目标数据库生成高质量、高覆盖率的合成Text-to-SQL数据，无需SQL日志或人工标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决企业场景中模型需要针对单一数据库模式进行专业化的问题，使组织能够在自己的数据库上评估Text-to-SQL系统。

Method: 分层划分数据库模式为子模式，跨多个复杂度级别合成SQL查询，应用质量感知管道包括LLM验证、可执行性检查、自动修复和列平衡。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试子集上，SingSQL-LM-3B-R64达到82.87% Soft F1和73.03% EX上限，比最佳3B规模基线提升+16.21 Soft F1和+12.36 EX。

Conclusion: SING-SQL为生产企业级Text-to-SQL系统提供了一个可扩展、数据库无关的范式，无模式微调结合仅模式推理提供最稳健的结果。

Abstract: Translating natural language questions into SQL has become a core challenge
in enabling non-technical users to query databases. While recent work has
explored large-scale synthetic data generation to improve model performance
through post-training, most efforts emphasize cross-domain generalization. This
leaves a gap for real-world enterprise scenarios, where models need to
specialize to a single database schema and organizations require to be able to
evaluate their Text-to-SQL systems on their own databases. To address this, we
introduce SING-SQL, a fully automated two-stage framework for generating
high-quality, high-coverage synthetic Text-to-SQL data for any target database,
without relying on SQL logs or manual annotations. Our approach hierarchically
partitions a database schema into sub-schemas, synthesizes SQL queries across
multiple complexity levels, and applies a quality-aware pipeline that includes
LLM-as-a-judge validation, executability checks, automatic repair, and column
balancing. We further release SingSQL-LM, a family of compact language models
fine-tuned on the synthetic data, achieving strong in-domain generalization. On
the subset of the BIRD benchmark, SingSQL-LM-3B-R64 reaches 82.87% Soft F1 and
73.03% EX upper bound with 32 candidates, outperforming the best 3B-scale
baseline by +16.21 in Soft F1 and +12.36 in EX. At the 1.5B scale,
SingSQL-LM-1.5B-R64 improves over prior systems by +9.30 in Soft F1 and +4.49
in EX. On synthetic evaluation sets, SingSQL-LMs exceed prior systems by wide
margins, establishing state-of-the-art performance among open models at
comparable scales. Our study of context management strategies reveals that
schema-free fine-tuning combined with schema-only inference provides the most
robust results. These findings establish SING-SQL as a scalable,
database-agnostic paradigm for producing and evaluating enterprise-grade
Text-to-SQL systems.

Motivation: 解决超大型MoE模型在资源受限边缘平台上的部署困难问题，传统剪枝或量化方法难以在保持精度的同时实现超激进压缩比。

Method: 采用协作压缩框架，结合专家剪枝、混合精度量化和激活优化三种技术，协同降低模型存储需求。

Result: 成功将DeepSeek-V3从1.3TB压缩至103GB，在128GB内存限制下部署，精度优于传统均匀低比特量化方法。

Conclusion: 该协作压缩框架有效解决了超大型MoE模型在边缘平台的部署挑战，在保持高质量输出的同时显著减少存储需求。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture is an important method for scaling
Large Language Models (LLMs). It increases model capacity while keeping
computation cost low. However, the ultra-large MoE models still have hundreds
of billions of parameters, requiring massive memory/storage and leading to
difficulties for deployment on resource-constrained edge platforms. Pruning or
quantization alone can hardly address the issue, because of the
super-aggressive compression ratio with significantly degraded accuracy and
output quality. To facilitate the deployment of ultra-large MoEs on edge
platforms, we propose a collaborative compression framework by combining expert
pruning, mixed-precision quantization, and activation optimization. It can
effectively reduce the storage footprint of the ultra-large MoE DeepSeek-V3
from 1.3TB to 103GB, while preserving high output quality with better accuracy
than traditional uniform low-bit quantization methods. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to deploy a compressed model from the ultra-large
DeepSeek-V3 on the platform with a strict 128GB total memory limit. Our
comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks under various memory
constraints demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with smaller model
sizes and higher accuracy than uniform low-bit quantization methods.

Abstract: Navigating heterogeneous traffic environments with diverse driving styles
poses a significant challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs) due to their
inherent complexity and dynamic interactions. This paper addresses this
challenge by proposing a heterogeneous graph reinforcement learning (GRL)
framework enhanced with an expert system to improve AV decision-making
performance. Initially, a heterogeneous graph representation is introduced to
capture the intricate interactions among vehicles. Then, a heterogeneous graph
neural network with an expert model (HGNN-EM) is proposed to effectively encode
diverse vehicle features and produce driving instructions informed by
domain-specific knowledge. Moreover, the double deep Q-learning (DDQN)
algorithm is utilized to train the decision-making model. A case study on a
typical four-way intersection, involving various driving styles of human
vehicles (HVs), demonstrates that the proposed method has superior performance
over several baselines regarding safety, efficiency, stability, and convergence
rate, all while maintaining favorable real-time performance.

Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在各种任务中表现出色，但在组合推理方面存在困难，即分解和重组概念来解决新问题的能力。神经符号方法虽然前景广阔，但通常受到精确逻辑执行或预定义谓词的限制，缺乏灵活性。

Method: NePTune通过混合执行模型，将自然语言查询动态翻译成可执行的Python程序，这些程序结合了命令式控制流和能够推理VLM生成不确定性的软逻辑运算符。采用模块化设计，将感知与推理解耦，支持无训练操作，同时其可微分操作支持微调。

Conclusion: NePTune通过神经符号方法成功克服了现有方法的局限性，在组合推理任务中表现出色，具有很好的泛化能力和适应性。

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
various tasks, yet they often struggle with compositional reasoning, the
ability to decompose and recombine concepts to solve novel problems. While
neuro-symbolic approaches offer a promising direction, they are typically
constrained by crisp logical execution or predefined predicates, which limit
flexibility. In this work, we introduce NePTune, a neuro-symbolic framework
that overcomes these limitations through a hybrid execution model that
integrates the perception capabilities of foundation vision models with the
compositional expressiveness of symbolic reasoning. NePTune dynamically
translates natural language queries into executable Python programs that blend
imperative control flow with soft logic operators capable of reasoning over
VLM-generated uncertainty. Operating in a training-free manner, NePTune, with a
modular design, decouples perception from reasoning, yet its differentiable
operations support fine-tuning. We evaluate NePTune on multiple visual
reasoning benchmarks and various domains, utilizing adversarial tests, and
demonstrate a significant improvement over strong base models, as well as its
effective compositional generalization and adaptation capabilities in novel
environments.

Motivation: 理解后训练技术（如监督微调和强化学习）如何从架构层面提升大模型的推理能力，揭示这些改进背后的机制。

Method: 使用电路分析方法，比较Qwen系列模型和DeepSeek蒸馏模型，分析不同训练机制下注意力头的演化模式。

Result: 发现蒸馏和SFT产生稳定的累积性推理头，而GRPO采用动态搜索模式；可控思考模型没有专门的思考头，关闭显式推理会激活更广泛但效率较低的补偿头。

Conclusion: 复杂推理能力的发展以基础计算可靠性为代价，需要在训练策略设计中平衡有效推理策略与可靠执行之间的关系。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of modern large reasoning models are largely
unlocked through post-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning. However, the architectural mechanisms behind such
improvements remain largely opaque. In this work, we use circuit analysis to
demonstrate that post-training for complex reasoning sparks the emergence of
novel, functionally specialized attention heads. These heads collectively
support structured reasoning and computation. Our comparative analysis across
Qwen families and DeepSeek-distilled model reveals that these emergent heads
evolve differently under different training regimes. Distillation and SFT
foster a cumulative addition of stable reasoning heads. In contrast, group
relative policy optimization operates in a dynamic search mode: relatively few
attention heads are iteratively activated, evaluated, and pruned, with their
survival closely tracking fluctuations in the task reward signal. Furthermore,
we find that controllable think on/off models do not possess dedicated thinking
heads. Instead, turning off explicit reasoning triggers a broader-but less
efficient-set of compensatory heads. Through ablation and qualitative analyses,
we connect these circuit-level dynamics to a crucial performance trade-off:
strengthened heads enable sophisticated problem-solving strategies for
difficult problems but can also introduce over-thinking failure modes, such as
calculation errors or logical loops on simpler tasks. These findings connect
circuit-level dynamics to macro-level performance, identifying an inherent
tension where complex reasoning comes at the cost of elementary computations.
More broadly, our work points to future directions for training policy design,
emphasizing the need to balance the development of effective reasoning
strategies with the assurance of reliable, flawless execution.

TL;DR: LLMs在创意任务中倾向于回归平庸，通过广告概念创造力压力测试发现模型偏好高概率信息，缺乏真正原创性。提供特定线索可部分改善但仍有局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在创意任务中的表现，发现它们倾向于使用安全、通用的表达方式，引发对其创造力处理能力的质疑。

Method: 使用广告概念作为创造力压力测试，逐步简化广告创意，分析创意特征的消失顺序；从简化输入重新生成文本，结合定量比较和定性分析。

Result: 创意特征（隐喻、情感、视觉线索）早期消失，事实内容保留；重新生成的文本虽词汇丰富但缺乏深度和独特性；提供特定线索可改善风格平衡但仍有熟悉套路。

Conclusion: 无针对性指导时LLMs在创意任务中趋向平庸；结构化信号可部分抵消此倾向，为开发创造力敏感模型指明方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate fluent text yet often default to safe,
generic phrasing, raising doubts about their ability to handle creativity. We
formalize this tendency as a Galton-style regression to the mean in language
and evaluate it using a creativity stress test in advertising concepts. When ad
ideas were simplified step by step, creative features such as metaphors,
emotions, and visual cues disappeared early, while factual content remained,
showing that models favor high-probability information. When asked to
regenerate from simplified inputs, models produced longer outputs with lexical
variety but failed to recover the depth and distinctiveness of the originals.
We combined quantitative comparisons with qualitative analysis, which revealed
that the regenerated texts often appeared novel but lacked true originality.
Providing ad-specific cues such as metaphors, emotional hooks and visual
markers improved alignment and stylistic balance, though outputs still relied
on familiar tropes. Taken together, the findings show that without targeted
guidance, LLMs drift towards mediocrity in creative tasks; structured signals
can partially counter this tendency and point towards pathways for developing
creativity-sensitive models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 在TravelPlanner基准上，Planner-R1方法仅用180个训练查询就实现了56.9%的最终通过率，比GPT-5基线提高了2.7倍，是公开排行榜上最强的智能体结果。研究发现小模型（8B）对奖励塑造高度敏感，在密集过程级信号下达到竞争性能，同时计算效率提高3.5倍，内存效率提高1.5倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究智能体强化学习与大语言模型在TravelPlanner基准上的表现，探索如何通过奖励塑造提高训练效率，同时保持泛化能力。

Method: 使用Planner-R1方法，结合奖励塑造技术，在TravelPlanner基准上进行训练。比较不同规模模型（8B vs 32B）对密集和稀疏奖励的响应，并评估计算和内存效率。

Result: Planner-R1达到56.9%最终通过率，比GPT-5基线提高2.7倍。8B模型在密集奖励信号下表现竞争性，计算效率提高3.5倍，内存效率提高1.5倍。大模型在稀疏奖励下更稳健但增益较小。微调模型在域外任务上保持或超过基线性能。

Conclusion: 奖励塑造是扩展智能体强化学习的关键杠杆，小模型具有竞争优势，效率提升不会牺牲泛化能力。8B模型是智能体强化学习的最有效设置。

Abstract: We investigated Agentic RL with large language models on the
\textsc{TravelPlanner} benchmark. Our approach, \textsc{Planner-R1}, achieved a
\textbf{56.9\%} final-pass rate with only 180 training queries, a $2.7\times$
improvement over GPT-5's $21.2\%$ baseline and the strongest agentic result on
the public leaderboard. A central finding was that smaller models (8B) were
highly responsive to reward shaping: with dense process-level signals, they
reached competitive performance while being $3.5\times$ more compute-efficient
and $1.5\times$ more memory-efficient than 32B models. Larger models were more
robust under sparse rewards but exhibited smaller relative gains from shaping
and higher variance across runs. While curriculum learning offered no
significant benefit, shaped rewards consistently amplified learning dynamics,
making 8B models the most efficient setting for agentic RL. Crucially, these
gains did not come at the cost of overfitting: fine-tuned models mostly
maintained or exceeded baseline performance on out-of-domain tasks, including
\textsc{Multi-IF}, \textsc{NaturalPlan}, and $\tau$-\textsc{Bench}. These
results establish reward shaping as a decisive lever for scaling agentic RL,
highlight the competitive strength of smaller models, and demonstrate that
efficiency can be achieved without sacrificing generalization.

*Alexander Branch,Omead Pooladzandi,Radin Khosraviani,Sunay Gajanan Bhat,Jeffrey Jiang,Gregory Pottie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PureVQ-GAN是一种通过向量量化VAE和GAN鉴别器来防御数据中毒攻击的方法，通过离散瓶颈破坏细粒度触发模式，同时保持语义内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数据中毒防御方法（如基于扩散的方法）需要数百次迭代优化步骤，计算成本高，不适用于实际训练流程。

Method: 使用向量量化VAE（VQ-VAE）和GAN鉴别器，通过学习的码本对中毒图像进行量化，破坏触发模式，同时GAN确保输出符合自然图像分布。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上，对Gradient Matching和Bullseye Polytope攻击实现0%中毒成功率，对Narcissus攻击为1.64%，同时保持91-95%的干净准确率，比基于扩散的防御快50倍以上。

Conclusion: PureVQ-GAN提供了一种高效实用的数据中毒防御方案，在保持高防御效果的同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: We introduce PureVQ-GAN, a defense against data poisoning that forces
backdoor triggers through a discrete bottleneck using Vector-Quantized VAE with
GAN discriminator. By quantizing poisoned images through a learned codebook,
PureVQ-GAN destroys fine-grained trigger patterns while preserving semantic
content. A GAN discriminator ensures outputs match the natural image
distribution, preventing reconstruction of out-of-distribution perturbations.
On CIFAR-10, PureVQ-GAN achieves 0% poison success rate (PSR) against Gradient
Matching and Bullseye Polytope attacks, and 1.64% against Narcissus while
maintaining 91-95% clean accuracy. Unlike diffusion-based defenses requiring
hundreds of iterative refinement steps, PureVQ-GAN is over 50x faster, making
it practical for real training pipelines.

### [465] [Chain-in-Tree: Back to Sequential Reasoning in LLM Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25835)
*Xinzhe Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Chain-in-Tree (CiT) 是一个插件框架，通过在搜索过程中自适应地决定何时分支而不是每一步都分支，显著提高了基于树搜索的LLM推理效率，减少75-85%的计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于树搜索的LLM推理方法虽然性能优异，但计算效率极低，通常比简单迭代方法慢一个数量级，这限制了其实际应用。

Method: CiT框架引入了轻量级的Branching Necessity (BN)评估方法：BN-DP使用辅助LLM直接判断步骤是否需要分支，BN-SC通过聚类多个候选动作来估计一致性。

Result: 在GSM8K和Math500上的实验显示，BN-DP能稳定减少75-85%的token生成、模型调用和运行时间，准确率损失可忽略甚至有时提升；BN-SC也能节省高达80%的计算，但在少数情况下不稳定。

Conclusion: CiT框架显著提升了树搜索LLM推理的效率，辅助LLM的质量对性能至关重要，BN-SC在确定性动作空间中无需LLM即可实现聚类。

Abstract: Test-time scaling enables large language models (LLMs) to improve performance
on long-horizon reasoning tasks by allocating additional compute at inference.
Tree-search-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art results in this setting,
but they are notoriously inefficient, often an order of magnitude slower than
simpler iterative methods. We introduce Chain-in-Tree (CiT), a plug-in
framework that adaptively decides when to branch during search rather than
branching at every step. CiT relies on lightweight Branching Necessity (BN)
evaluation methods: BN-DP (Direct Prompting), where an auxiliary LLM directly
judges whether a step requires branching, and BN-SC (Self-Consistency), which
clusters multiple candidate actions to estimate agreement. We integrate CiT
into three representative LLM-in-the-loop tree search frameworks: Tree of
Thoughts (ToT-BS), ReST-MCTS, and RAP, and evaluate across GSM8K and Math500.
Our results show that: (1) BN-DP consistently reduces token generation, model
invocations, and runtime by 75-85 percent across all settings, with negligible
accuracy loss and sometimes accuracy gains; (2) BN-SC typically yields
substantial savings (up to 80 percent) but shows instability in 1-4 out of 14
settings, caused by a small subset of examples that produce very long reasoning
steps; (3) the quality of auxiliary LLMs is critical, not only the BN evaluator
in BN-DP, but also the models used in BN-SC for clustering and equivalence
checking. When these roles are filled by smaller LLMs, performance degrades.
Importantly, BN-SC does not require LLMs in domains with deterministic action
spaces, where clustering can be done programmatically. We also provide a
theoretical guarantee that BN-DP never increases LLM invocations relative to
the baseline and release a unified implementation of CiT across ToT-BS,
ReST-MCTS, and RAP to facilitate reproducibility and extension.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了HiStyle，一种基于层次化预测和对比学习的风格嵌入预测方法，用于可控语音合成系统，通过两阶段预测和文本-音频嵌入空间对齐，显著提升了风格控制能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控TTS系统使用自然语言描述控制时，直接预测全局风格嵌入忽略了嵌入的底层分布结构，限制了系统的控制潜力。

Method: 使用t-SNE分析发现风格嵌入呈现层次聚类模式，据此提出HiStyle两阶段风格嵌入预测器，结合对比学习对齐文本和音频嵌入空间，并提出统计方法与人类听觉偏好相结合的标注策略。

Result: 实验表明HiStyle在基础TTS模型上相比其他方法实现了显著更好的风格可控性，同时保持了高质量的自然度和可懂度。

Conclusion: 层次化风格嵌入预测结合对比学习能够有效提升可控语音合成的性能，揭示了风格嵌入的分布结构对系统控制能力的重要性。

Abstract: Controllable speech synthesis refers to the precise control of speaking style
by manipulating specific prosodic and paralinguistic attributes, such as
gender, volume, speech rate, pitch, and pitch fluctuation. With the integration
of advanced generative models, particularly large language models (LLMs) and
diffusion models, controllable text-to-speech (TTS) systems have increasingly
transitioned from label-based control to natural language description-based
control, which is typically implemented by predicting global style embeddings
from textual prompts. However, this straightforward prediction overlooks the
underlying distribution of the style embeddings, which may hinder the full
potential of controllable TTS systems. In this study, we use t-SNE analysis to
visualize and analyze the global style embedding distribution of various
mainstream TTS systems, revealing a clear hierarchical clustering pattern:
embeddings first cluster by timbre and subsequently subdivide into finer
clusters based on style attributes. Based on this observation, we propose
HiStyle, a two-stage style embedding predictor that hierarchically predicts
style embeddings conditioned on textual prompts, and further incorporate
contrastive learning to help align the text and audio embedding spaces.
Additionally, we propose a style annotation strategy that leverages the
complementary strengths of statistical methodologies and human auditory
preferences to generate more accurate and perceptually consistent textual
prompts for style control. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that when
applied to the base TTS model, HiStyle achieves significantly better style
controllability than alternative style embedding predicting approaches while
preserving high speech quality in terms of naturalness and intelligibility.

*Yein Park,Jungwoo Park,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASGuard是一个基于机制理解的框架，通过识别与时态越狱攻击相关的注意力头，训练精确的缩放向量来重新校准激活，并通过预防性微调增强模型的拒绝机制，有效降低针对性越狱攻击成功率，同时保持通用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型尽管经过安全对齐，但仍表现出脆弱的拒绝行为，简单的语言变化（如时态改写）就能绕过其安全机制，这揭示了当前对齐方法中存在关键泛化差距，其底层机制尚不清楚。

Method: 使用电路分析识别与时态越狱攻击相关的特定注意力头；训练精确的通道级缩放向量来重新校准这些易受攻击头的激活；通过"预防性微调"强制模型学习更鲁棒的拒绝机制。

Result: 在三个大型语言模型上，ASGuard有效降低了针对性越狱攻击的成功率，同时保持了通用能力并最小化了过度拒绝，实现了安全性和实用性的帕累托最优平衡。

Conclusion: 研究展示了如何利用对模型内部机制的深入理解来开发实用、高效和针对性的方法调整模型行为，为更可靠和可解释的AI安全指明了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite being safety-aligned, exhibit brittle
refusal behaviors that can be circumvented by simple linguistic changes. As
tense jailbreaking demonstrates that models refusing harmful requests often
comply when rephrased in past tense, a critical generalization gap is revealed
in current alignment methods whose underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.
In this work, we introduce Activation-Scaling Guard (ASGuard), an insightful,
mechanistically-informed framework that surgically mitigates this specific
vulnerability. For the first step, we use circuit analysis to identify the
specific attention heads causally linked to the targeted jailbreaking, the
tense-changing attack. Second, we train a precise, channel-wise scaling vector
to recalibrate the activation of tense vulnerable heads. Lastly, we apply it
into a "preventative fine-tuning", forcing the model to learn a more robust
refusal mechanism. Across three LLMs, ASGuard effectively reduces the attack
success rate of targeted jailbreaking while preserving general capabilities and
minimizing over refusal, achieving a Pareto-optimal balance between safety and
utility. Our findings underscore how adversarial suffixes suppress the
propagation of the refusal-mediating direction, based on mechanistic analysis.
Furthermore, our work showcases how a deep understanding of model internals can
be leveraged to develop practical, efficient, and targeted methods for
adjusting model behavior, charting a course for more reliable and interpretable
AI safety.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CIMNAS是一个用于存内计算(CIM)神经网络加速器的联合模型-量化-硬件优化框架，能够同时优化软件参数、量化策略和硬件参数，在保持73.81%准确率的同时显著提升能效和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了最大化存内计算(CIM)神经网络加速器的硬件效率和性能精度，需要同时优化软件和硬件设计参数。由于参数数量庞大且相互依赖复杂，手动调优不可行。

Method: 提出CIMNAS框架，在9.9×10^85个参数组合的搜索空间中，同时搜索软件参数、量化策略和硬件参数，包含器件级、电路级和架构级的协同优化。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，相比基准方法，CIMNAS将能量-延迟-面积乘积(EDAP)降低了90.1-104.5倍，TOPS/W提升了4.68-4.82倍，TOPS/mm²提升了11.3-12.78倍，准确率保持在73.81%。

Conclusion: CIMNAS实现了无精度损失的EDAP优化，为高性能CIM神经网络设计生成了多样化的软硬件参数组合，并成功扩展到SRAM-based ResNet50架构，展示了其适应性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: To maximize hardware efficiency and performance accuracy in Compute-In-Memory
(CIM)-based neural network accelerators for Artificial Intelligence (AI)
applications, co-optimizing both software and hardware design parameters is
essential. Manual tuning is impractical due to the vast number of parameters
and their complex interdependencies. To effectively automate the design and
optimization of CIM-based neural network accelerators, hardware-aware neural
architecture search (HW-NAS) techniques can be applied. This work introduces
CIMNAS, a joint model-quantization-hardware optimization framework for CIM
architectures. CIMNAS simultaneously searches across software parameters,
quantization policies, and a broad range of hardware parameters, incorporating
device-, circuit-, and architecture-level co-optimizations. CIMNAS experiments
were conducted over a search space of 9.9x10^85 potential parameter
combinations with the MobileNet model as a baseline and RRAM-based CIM
architecture. Evaluated on the ImageNet dataset, CIMNAS achieved a reduction in
energy-delay-area product (EDAP) ranging from 90.1x to 104.5x, an improvement
in TOPS/W between 4.68x and 4.82x, and an enhancement in TOPS/mm^2 from 11.3x
to 12.78x relative to various baselines, all while maintaining an accuracy of
73.81%. The adaptability and robustness of CIMNAS are demonstrated by extending
the framework to support the SRAM-based ResNet50 architecture, achieving up to
an 819.5x reduction in EDAP. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, CIMNAS
achieves EDAP-focused optimization without any accuracy loss, generating
diverse software-hardware parameter combinations for high-performance CIM-based
neural network designs. The source code of CIMNAS is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lita（Lite Agent）是一个轻量级代码代理框架，通过最小化人工设计来评估LLMs的真实编程能力，在减少token消耗和设计成本的同时，达到或超越复杂工作流代理的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码代理设计过度依赖复杂的人工工作流和工具集，导致性能对提示调优敏感、真实能力被掩盖、构建维护成本高，且存在数据泄露风险。LLM提供商通常不公开评估框架。

Method: 引入Lita框架，遵循"轻量化"原则，在保持完全自主代理基本要素的同时最小化人工设计，实现更忠实和统一的评估。

Result: 在Aider Polyglot和SWE-Bench上的实验表明，Lita相比基于工作流的代理基线达到竞争性或更优性能，同时消耗更少token且设计成本显著降低。

Conclusion: Lita足以揭示现代LLMs的底层编程能力，并提出Agent复杂性定律：随着核心模型改进，不同复杂度代理间的性能差距将缩小至可忽略程度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to programming
tasks, ranging from single-turn code completion to autonomous agents. Current
code agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and
tool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several
challenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and
custom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true
underlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and
maintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of
data leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI
and Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models'
coding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks
confidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent),
which operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while
retaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a
more faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments
on the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and
agentic baselines. Crucially, Lita also consumes fewer tokens and requires
significantly less design effort. Our results suggest that Lita is sufficient
to reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. Finally, we propose
the Agent Complexity Law: the performance gap between agents of varying
complexity, from simple to sophisticated designs, will shrink as the core model
improves, ultimately converging to a negligible difference.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了SafeMindBench基准测试和SafeMindAgent架构，用于系统评估和缓解具身LLM代理的安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 具身代理继承了LLM的高级规划能力，但直接与物理世界交互会暴露安全漏洞，需要系统化的安全风险评估和解决方案。

Method: 识别四个关键推理阶段的安全风险，形式化三种安全约束类型，构建多模态基准测试SafeMindBench，并提出SafeMindAgent架构集成三个级联安全模块。

Result: 实验显示主流LLM和具身代理仍易发生安全关键故障，而SafeMindAgent显著提高了安全率，同时保持可比较的任务完成度。

Conclusion: SafeMindBench和SafeMindAgent为具身LLM代理的安全风险提供了严格的评估套件和实用解决方案，推动了系统化安全研究。

Abstract: Embodied agents powered by large language models (LLMs) inherit advanced
planning capabilities; however, their direct interaction with the physical
world exposes them to safety vulnerabilities. In this work, we identify four
key reasoning stages where hazards may arise: Task Understanding, Environment
Perception, High-Level Plan Generation, and Low-Level Action Generation. We
further formalize three orthogonal safety constraint types (Factual, Causal,
and Temporal) to systematically characterize potential safety violations.
Building on this risk model, we present SafeMindBench, a multimodal benchmark
with 5,558 samples spanning four task categories (Instr-Risk, Env-Risk,
Order-Fix, Req-Align) across high-risk scenarios such as sabotage, harm,
privacy, and illegal behavior. Extensive experiments on SafeMindBench reveal
that leading LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and widely used embodied agents remain
susceptible to safety-critical failures. To address this challenge, we
introduce SafeMindAgent, a modular Planner-Executor architecture integrated
with three cascaded safety modules, which incorporate safety constraints into
the reasoning process. Results show that SafeMindAgent significantly improves
safety rate over strong baselines while maintaining comparable task completion.
Together, SafeMindBench and SafeMindAgent provide both a rigorous evaluation
suite and a practical solution that advance the systematic study and mitigation
of safety risks in embodied LLM agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估LLMs JSON输出能力的基准过于强调纯JSON生成，而忽略了数据理解和提取能力，这与实际网络数据挖掘任务相关性不足。

Method: 引入DeepJSONEval基准，包含2100个多领域实例，按难度分类，具有深度嵌套结构，用于评估LLMs处理复杂JSON结构的能力。

Result: 实验显示不同LLMs在处理这种复杂性时存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: DeepJSONEval基准和数据集已开源，旨在推进结构化JSON生成研究。

Abstract: The internet is saturated with low-density, high-redundancy information, such
as social media comments, repetitive news, and lengthy discussions, making it
difficult to extract valuable insights efficiently. Multi-layer nested JSON
structures provide an effective solution by compressing such information into
semantically rich, hierarchical representations, which organize data into
key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects, preserving contextual
relationships and enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and semantic querying.
For instance, in news aggregation, a JSON object can nest an article's metadata
(title, author, date), content (text, multimedia), and multimedia information
(multimedia type, caption) hierarchically. Large Language Models (LLMs) play a
transformative role in web data mining by parsing unstructured text and
outputting structured results directly into complex JSON schemas. However,
current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' JSON output capabilities overemphasize
pure JSON generation rather than assessing data comprehension and extraction
abilities, a limitation that lacks relevance to practical web data mining
tasks. To address this, we introduce DeepJSONEval, a novel benchmark featuring
2100 multi-domain instances with deep nested structures, categorized by
difficulty. Experiments show significant performance gaps among LLMs in
handling such complexity. Our benchmark and datasets are open-sourced to
advance research in structured JSON
generation.(https://github.com/GTS-AI-Infra-Lab-SotaS/DeepJSONEval).

Abstract: Healthcare and Medicine are under constant pressure to provide patient-driven
medical expertise to ensure a fast and accurate treatment of the patient. In
such scenarios, the diagnosis contains, the family history, long term medical
data and a detailed consultation with the patient. In time-critical
emergencies, such conversation and time-consuming elaboration are not possible.
Rescue services need to provide fast, reliable treatments for the patient in
need. With the help of modern technologies, like treatment recommendations,
real-time vitals-monitoring, and situation detection through artificial
intelligence (AI) a situation can be analyzed and supported in providing fast,
accurate patient-data-driven medical treatments. In KIRETT, a wearable device
is developed to support in such scenarios and presents a way to provide
treatment recommendation in rescue services. The objective of this paper is to
present the quantitative results of a two-day KIRETT evaluation (14
participants) to analyze the needs of rescue operators in healthcare.

*Raphael Schumann,Stefan Riezler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究大型语言模型在推理过程中产生的虚假思维链问题，发现当问题对模型来说难以解决时，更容易出现虚假思维链导致误判。通过估计问题的可解性，作者开发了改进的奖励模型和强化学习方法，在数学和多模态数据集上显著提高了推理过程的正确性和答案准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于理解大型语言模型推理质量不仅取决于最终答案正确性，还依赖于生成有效的中间推理步骤。在多选题回答场景中，当问题对模型来说难以解决时，容易出现虚假思维链导致错误判断。

Method: 通过估计每个问题的可解性，识别出学习最有效的中间区域。在此基础上，改进了结果监督的奖励模型，并在强化学习中引入组相对优势，将可解性纳入目标函数。

Result: 在数学和多模态数据集上的实验表明，这些改进方法持续提高了过程正确推理的比例，在强化学习中也提升了答案准确性。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明可解性是减少思维链推理中幻觉现象、提高可靠性的关键因素，为改进语言模型的推理能力提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Reasoning quality in large language models depends not only on producing
correct answers but also on generating valid intermediate steps. We study this
through multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), which provides a controlled
setting with fixed answer options. Our analysis shows that when questions are
effectively unsolvable for a model, spurious chains of thought (CoTs) are more
likely to appear, leading to false positives. By estimating the solvability of
each question, we uncover an intermediate regime where learning is most
effective. Building on this insight, we adapt outcome-supervised reward models
and reinforcement learning with group-relative advantage to incorporate
solvability into their objectives. Across experiments on math and multimodal
datasets, these modifications consistently yield higher rates of
process-correct reasoning and, in reinforcement learning, improved answer
accuracy as well. Our results highlight solvability as a key factor for
reducing hallucinations and increasing reliability in CoT reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了NuRisk数据集，用于自动驾驶中的时空风险推理，包含2900个场景和110万个智能体级样本。基准测试显示现有VLM模型表现不佳，而微调的7B VLM模型将准确率提升至41%，延迟降低75%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于视觉语言模型的方法主要在静态图像中定位智能体并提供定性判断，缺乏捕捉风险随时间演变的时空推理能力。

Method: 构建NuRisk数据集，包含基于真实世界数据（nuScenes、Waymo）和模拟器（CommonRoad）的BEV序列图像，提供定量智能体级风险标注。对知名VLM模型进行基准测试，并微调7B VLM模型。

Result: 现有VLM模型峰值准确率仅33%且延迟高，微调后的7B VLM模型准确率提升至41%，延迟降低75%，展现出专有模型所缺乏的显式时空推理能力。

Conclusion: 虽然取得了显著进展，但41%的准确率仍表明该任务的巨大挑战，NuRisk成为推进自动驾驶时空推理的关键基准。

Abstract: Understanding risk in autonomous driving requires not only perception and
prediction, but also high-level reasoning about agent behavior and context.
Current Vision Language Models (VLMs)-based methods primarily ground agents in
static images and provide qualitative judgments, lacking the spatio-temporal
reasoning needed to capture how risks evolve over time. To address this gap, we
propose NuRisk, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset
comprising 2,900 scenarios and 1.1 million agent-level samples, built on
real-world data from nuScenes and Waymo, supplemented with safety-critical
scenarios from the CommonRoad simulator. The dataset provides Bird-Eye-View
(BEV) based sequential images with quantitative, agent-level risk annotations,
enabling spatio-temporal reasoning. We benchmark well-known VLMs across
different prompting techniques and find that they fail to perform explicit
spatio-temporal reasoning, resulting in a peak accuracy of 33% at high latency.
To address these shortcomings, our fine-tuned 7B VLM agent improves accuracy to
41% and reduces latency by 75%, demonstrating explicit spatio-temporal
reasoning capabilities that proprietary models lacked. While this represents a
significant step forward, the modest accuracy underscores the profound
challenge of the task, establishing NuRisk as a critical benchmark for
advancing spatio-temporal reasoning in autonomous driving.

Method: 使用多模态多步骤管道，包含AnalyzerVLM模块进行多步骤分析以提出候选模型，EvaluatorVLM模块从定量和感知角度评估候选模型的局部细节拟合度和整体趋势泛化能力。

Result: 该方法能够有效发现既能捕捉精细细节又具有强泛化能力的模型，消融研究表明多模态和多步骤推理对发现优质模型都至关重要。

Conclusion: 提出的多模态多步骤自动化模型发现管道通过视觉语言模块的智能分析和评估，成功解决了细节捕捉与泛化能力的平衡问题。

Abstract: Automated model discovery is the process of automatically searching and
identifying the most appropriate model for a given dataset over a large
combinatorial search space. Existing approaches, however, often face challenges
in balancing the capture of fine-grained details with ensuring generalizability
beyond training data regimes with a reasonable model complexity. In this paper,
we present a multi-modal \& multi-step pipeline for effective automated model
discovery. Our approach leverages two vision-language-based modules (VLM),
AnalyzerVLM and EvaluatorVLM, for effective model proposal and evaluation in an
agentic way. AnalyzerVLM autonomously plans and executes multi-step analyses to
propose effective candidate models. EvaluatorVLM assesses the candidate models
both quantitatively and perceptually, regarding the fitness for local details
and the generalibility for overall trends. Our results demonstrate that our
pipeline effectively discovers models that capture fine details and ensure
strong generalizability. Additionally, extensive ablation studies show that
both multi-modality and multi-step reasoning play crucial roles in discovering
favorable models.

*Gang Li,Yulei Qin,Xiaoyu Tan,Dingkang Yang,Yuchen Shi,Zihan Xu,Xiang Li,Xing Sun,Ke Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了RoRecomp方法，通过策略性地重组训练数据来引导模型进行简洁推理，解决了RLVR训练中推理过程冗长和探索轨迹低效的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RLVR训练导致推理过程过于冗长和探索轨迹低效，因为仅基于结果的奖励无法激励效率，且响应长度的高方差导致优化信号噪声较大。

Method: RoRecomp方法将响应分为两种批次类型：1) 优先批次，结合短正确和长错误响应提供简洁性梯度信号；2) 补偿批次，使用回放缓冲区中的剩余响应保持稳定性。

Result: 在三种设置中均取得显著效率提升：零RL训练中推理长度减少27.7%，智能体RL中不必要工具调用减少46.8%且准确率提升，思维压缩中长度减少达52.5%，性能影响最小。

Conclusion: RoRecomp是一种即插即用的有效方法，能够在保持性能的同时显著提升推理效率，适用于多种RL设置。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has proven effective in
eliciting complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, standard
RLVR training often leads to excessively verbose processes (in reasoning tasks)
and inefficient exploration trajectories (in agentic settings), as outcome-only
rewards provide no incentive for efficiency and the high variance in response
length within relatively small rollout groups results in noisy optimization
signals. To address this, we propose Rollout Response Recomposition (RoRecomp),
a plug-and-play method that guides models toward concise reasoning by
strategically recomposing the training data. RoRecomp separates responses into
two distinct batch types: 1) priority batches, which combine short-correct and
long-incorrect responses selected from online batches to provide a clear
gradient signal for brevity, and 2) compensation batches, which utilize
remaining responses from a replay buffer to maintain stability and prevent
model collapse. To comprehensively evaluate effectiveness, we test RoRecomp
across three settings where results demonstrate substantial efficiency gains:
reducing reasoning length by 27.7% in zero RL training, reducing unnecessary
tool calls by 46.8% while improving accuracy in agentic RL, and achieving up to
52.5% length reduction in thinking compression, all with minimal performance
impact.

TL;DR: CURE是一个新的机器遗忘框架，通过验证模型输出是否泄露敏感信息并重写为安全响应来减少信息泄露，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注抑制敏感输出，但往往无法消除底层知识且扩展性有限，需要更有效的机器遗忘解决方案。

Method: 使用轻量级校正器验证模型输出是否包含目标知识，并通过检索相关遗忘目标作为上下文参考来检测和条件性重写输出。

Result: CURE显著减少了信息泄露，即使在间接查询情况下也表现良好，同时保持了响应质量和通用实用性。

Conclusion: CURE在持续遗忘场景下表现出鲁棒性，适用于实际应用，提供了一种可扩展的机器遗忘方法。

Abstract: Language models trained on web-scale corpora risk memorizing and exposing
sensitive information, prompting the need for effective machine unlearning.
Prior methods mainly focus on input queries to suppress sensitive outputs, yet
this often fails to eliminate the underlying knowledge and limits scalability.
To address this, we propose Corrective Unlearning with Retrieved Exclusions
(CURE), a novel unlearning framework that verifies model outputs for leakage
and revises them into safe responses. Specifically, CURE employs a lightweight
corrector that is applied to the original model to verify whether outputs
contain target knowledge and to rewrite them if any leakage is detected. To
efficiently handle large-scale unlearning requests, CURE retrieves unlearning
targets that are relevant to the initial response and provides them as
in-context references to the corrector for detection and conditional revision.
By leveraging this retrieval augmentation, the corrector can adapt to new
unlearning requests without additional training. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that CURE substantially reduces information leakage, even from
indirect queries where prior works fall short, while maintaining response
quality and general utility. Moreover, it demonstrates robustness under
continual unlearning scenarios, making it practical for real-world
applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了统一的多模态假内容检测框架UMFDet，能够同时处理人工制作的虚假信息和AI生成内容，解决了现有方法只能处理单一类型假内容的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中社交媒体上的多模态虚假内容包含人工制作的虚假信息和AI生成内容两种类型，但现有研究通常孤立处理这两种类型，导致在实际应用中效果有限。

Method: 构建了包含12.7万样本的OmniFake数据集，提出UMFDet框架，使用VLM骨干网络，结合类别感知的MoE适配器和归因思维链机制来捕获类别特定的欺骗信号。

Result: UMFDet在两种虚假内容类型上都实现了稳健且一致的性能表现，优于专门的基线方法。

Conclusion: UMFDet为现实世界的多模态欺骗检测提供了一个实用的解决方案，能够有效处理未知类型的多模态虚假内容。

Abstract: In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn
increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted
misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content
produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although
both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP
research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community
targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often
specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios,
however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the
effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the
Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive
benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from
existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this
dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a
framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM
backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to
capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism
that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive
signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and
consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming
specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world
multimodal deception detection.

Conclusion: CoLLM-NAS通过LLM的协作和知识引导，有效解决了现有LLM-NAS方法的局限性，为自动化神经架构设计提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Neural Architecture
Search (NAS) has introduced new possibilities for automating the design of
neural architectures. However, most existing methods face critical limitations,
including architectural invalidity, computational inefficiency, and inferior
performance compared to traditional NAS. In this work, we present Collaborative
LLM-based NAS (CoLLM-NAS), a two-stage NAS framework with knowledge-guided
search driven by two complementary LLMs. Specifically, we propose a Navigator
LLM to guide search direction and a Generator LLM to synthesize high-quality
candidates, with a dedicated Coordinator module to manage their interaction.
CoLLM-NAS efficiently guides the search process by combining LLMs' inherent
knowledge of structured neural architectures with progressive knowledge from
iterative feedback and historical trajectory. Experimental results on ImageNet
and NAS-Bench-201 show that CoLLM-NAS surpasses existing NAS methods and
conventional search algorithms, achieving new state-of-the-art results.
Furthermore, CoLLM-NAS consistently enhances the performance and efficiency of
various two-stage NAS methods (e.g., OFA, SPOS, and AutoFormer) across diverse
search spaces (e.g., MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and AutoFormer), demonstrating its
excellent generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM在社会科学中日益广泛应用，其输出容易被误解为来自连贯模型的类似后验的证据，需要澄清预测与概率推理的区别。

Method: 提出实用防护措施：独立抽样、预注册人类基线、可靠性感知验证和子组校准，以避免类别错误。

Result: 确立了LLM作为高容量模式匹配器的定位，强调在明确范围条件下进行准预测插值。

Conclusion: 研究人员可以在避免类别错误的同时，利用LLM进行有用的原型设计和预测，但必须采用适当的防护措施。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly used as synthetic agents
in social science, in applications ranging from augmenting survey responses to
powering multi-agent simulations. Because strong prediction plus conditioning
prompts, token log-probs, and repeated sampling mimic Bayesian workflows, their
outputs can be misinterpreted as posterior-like evidence from a coherent model.
However, prediction does not equate to probabilism, and accurate points do not
imply calibrated uncertainty. This paper outlines cautions that should be taken
when interpreting LLM outputs and proposes a pragmatic reframing for the social
sciences in which LLMs are used as high-capacity pattern matchers for
quasi-predictive interpolation under explicit scope conditions and not as
substitutes for probabilistic inference. Practical guardrails such as
independent draws, preregistered human baselines, reliability-aware validation,
and subgroup calibration, are introduced so that researchers may engage in
useful prototyping and forecasting while avoiding category errors.

Result: 实验显示SafeEvalAgent有效性，随着评估难度增加，模型安全性持续下降，例如GPT-5在欧盟AI法案上的安全率从72.50%降至36.36%。

Conclusion: 静态评估存在局限性，动态评估框架能够发现传统方法遗漏的深层漏洞，强调建立动态评估生态系统的紧迫性。

Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into high-stakes
domains necessitates reliable safety and compliance evaluation. However,
existing static benchmarks are ill-equipped to address the dynamic nature of AI
risks and evolving regulations, creating a critical safety gap. This paper
introduces a new paradigm of agentic safety evaluation, reframing evaluation as
a continuous and self-evolving process rather than a one-time audit. We then
propose a novel multi-agent framework SafeEvalAgent, which autonomously ingests
unstructured policy documents to generate and perpetually evolve a
comprehensive safety benchmark. SafeEvalAgent leverages a synergistic pipeline
of specialized agents and incorporates a Self-evolving Evaluation loop, where
the system learns from evaluation results to craft progressively more
sophisticated and targeted test cases. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of SafeEvalAgent, showing a consistent decline in model safety as
the evaluation hardens. For instance, GPT-5's safety rate on the EU AI Act
drops from 72.50% to 36.36% over successive iterations. These findings reveal
the limitations of static assessments and highlight our framework's ability to
uncover deep vulnerabilities missed by traditional methods, underscoring the
urgent need for dynamic evaluation ecosystems to ensure the safe and
responsible deployment of advanced AI.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are increasingly used to represent biomedical
information in structured, interpretable formats. However, existing biomedical
KGs often focus narrowly on molecular interactions or adverse events,
overlooking the rich data found in drug leaflets. In this work, we present (1)
a hackable, end-to-end pipeline to create KGs from unstructured online content
using a web scraper and an LLM; and (2) a curated dataset, MEDAKA, generated by
applying this method to publicly available drug leaflets. The dataset captures
clinically relevant attributes such as side effects, warnings,
contraindications, ingredients, dosage guidelines, storage instructions and
physical characteristics. We evaluate it through manual inspection and with an
LLM-as-a-Judge framework, and compare its coverage with existing biomedical KGs
and databases. We expect MEDAKA to support tasks such as patient safety
monitoring and drug recommendation. The pipeline can also be used for
constructing KGs from unstructured texts in other domains. Code and dataset are

Abstract: Depression is a major global public health challenge and its early
identification is crucial. Social media data provides a new perspective for
depression detection, but existing methods face limitations such as
insufficient accuracy, insufficient utilization of time series features, and
high annotation costs. To this end, this study proposes the LMILAtt model,
which innovatively integrates Long Short-Term Memory autoencoders and attention
mechanisms: firstly, the temporal dynamic features of user tweets (such as
depressive tendency evolution patterns) are extracted through unsupervised LSTM
autoencoders. Secondly, the attention mechanism is used to dynamically weight
key texts (such as early depression signals) and construct a multi-example
learning architecture to improve the accuracy of user-level detection. Finally,
the performance was verified on the WU3D dataset labeled by professional
medicine. Experiments show that the model is significantly better than the
baseline model in terms of accuracy, recall and F1 score. In addition, the
weakly supervised learning strategy significantly reduces the cost of labeling
and provides an efficient solution for large-scale social media depression
screening.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) integrated into agent-driven workflows hold
immense promise for healthcare, yet a significant gap exists between their
potential and practical implementation within clinical settings. To address
this, we present a practitioner-oriented field manual for deploying generative
agents that use electronic health record (EHR) data. This guide is informed by
our experience deploying the "irAE-Agent", an automated system to detect
immune-related adverse events from clinical notes at Mass General Brigham, and
by structured interviews with 20 clinicians, engineers, and informatics leaders
involved in the project. Our analysis reveals a critical misalignment in
clinical AI development: less than 20% of our effort was dedicated to prompt
engineering and model development, while over 80% was consumed by the
sociotechnical work of implementation. We distill this effort into five "heavy
lifts": data integration, model validation, ensuring economic value, managing
system drift, and governance. By providing actionable solutions for each of
these challenges, this field manual shifts the focus from algorithmic
development to the essential infrastructure and implementation work required to
bridge the "valley of death" and successfully translate generative AI from
pilot projects into routine clinical care.

Conclusion: UniGen是第一个端到端的协调多智能体框架，能够从自然语言需求自动生成可运行的3D游戏，有效解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Developing 3D games requires specialized expertise across multiple domains,
including programming, 3D modeling, and engine configuration, which limits
access to millions of potential creators. Recently, researchers have begun to
explore automated game development. However, existing approaches face three
primary challenges: (1) limited scope to 2D content generation or isolated code
snippets; (2) requirement for manual integration of generated components into
game engines; and (3) poor performance on handling interactive game logic and
state management. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate
potential capabilities to ease the game generation task, a critical gap still
remains in translating these outputs into production-ready, executable game
projects based on game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine.
  To bridge the gap, this paper introduces UniGen, the first end-to-end
coordinated multi-agent framework that automates zero-coding development of
runnable 3D games from natural language requirements. Specifically, UniGen uses
a Planning Agent that interprets user requirements into structured blueprints
and engineered logic descriptions; after which a Generation Agent produces
executable C# scripts; then an Automation Agent handles engine-specific
component binding and scene construction; and lastly a Debugging Agent provides
real-time error correction through conversational interaction. We evaluated
UniGen on three distinct game prototypes. Results demonstrate that UniGen not
only democratizes game creation by requiring no coding from the user, but also
reduces development time by 91.4%. We release UniGen at
https://github.com/yxwan123/UniGen. A video demonstration is available at

### [489] ['Too much alignment; not enough culture': Re-balancing cultural alignment practices in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26167)
*Eric J. W. Orlowski,Hakim Norhashim,Tristan Koh Ly Wey*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文主张将社会科学中的定性方法整合到AI对齐实践中，提出基于"厚描述"概念的"厚输出"方法，以解决当前文化对齐方法过于简化和定量化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI文化对齐方法主要依赖定量基准和简单代理，无法捕捉人类文化的细微差别和情境依赖性，需要从根本上转向更深入的文化理解方法。

Method: 借鉴Clifford Geertz的"厚描述"概念，提出AI系统应产生反映深层文化意义的"厚输出"，并概述了文化对齐成功的三个必要条件：充分范围的文化表征、细致输出的能力、以及输出在提示文化情境中的锚定。

Result: 提出了一个理论框架，强调需要跨学科合作和采用定性、民族志评估方法，以开发真正具有文化敏感性、伦理责任和反映人类复杂性的AI系统。

Conclusion: AI文化对齐需要从定量方法转向定性方法，通过"厚输出"和跨学科合作，实现真正意义上的文化敏感和对齐。

Abstract: While cultural alignment has increasingly become a focal point within AI
research, current approaches relying predominantly on quantitative benchmarks
and simplistic proxies fail to capture the deeply nuanced and context-dependent
nature of human cultures. Existing alignment practices typically reduce culture
to static demographic categories or superficial cultural facts, thereby
sidestepping critical questions about what it truly means to be culturally
aligned. This paper argues for a fundamental shift towards integrating
interpretive qualitative approaches drawn from social sciences into AI
alignment practices, specifically in the context of Large Language Models
(LLMs). Drawing inspiration from Clifford Geertz's concept of "thick
description," we propose that AI systems must produce outputs that reflect
deeper cultural meanings--what we term "thick outputs"-grounded firmly in
user-provided context and intent. We outline three necessary conditions for
successful cultural alignment: sufficiently scoped cultural representations,
the capacity for nuanced outputs, and the anchoring of outputs in the cultural
contexts implied within prompts. Finally, we call for cross-disciplinary
collaboration and the adoption of qualitative, ethnographic evaluation methods
as vital steps toward developing AI systems that are genuinely culturally
sensitive, ethically responsible, and reflective of human complexity.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型作为独立推理代理在材料科学知识发现中的应用潜力，特别是在没有明确指令的情况下自主探索复杂系统的能力。

Method: 使用LangGraph的工具功能为代理提供黑盒函数进行探索，通过儿童游戏验证方法，然后将相同策略应用于高级原子层处理反应器模拟。

Result: 证明了LLM代理能够通过试错和持久性进行知识发现，结果具有强路径依赖性，并且能够在有限探测能力下自主探索、发现和利用化学相互作用。

Conclusion: LLM代理在材料科学知识发现中具有实际应用潜力，能够自主探索复杂系统并生成可推广的陈述，为科学发现提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for several
years now. Recently, their use as independently reasoning agents has been
proposed. In this work, we test the potential of such agents for knowledge
discovery in materials science. We repurpose LangGraph's tool functionality to
supply agents with a black box function to interrogate. In contrast to process
optimization or performing specific, user-defined tasks, knowledge discovery
consists of freely exploring the system, posing and verifying statements about
the behavior of this black box, with the sole objective of generating and
verifying generalizable statements. We provide proof of concept for this
approach through a children's parlor game, demonstrating the role of
trial-and-error and persistence in knowledge discovery, and the strong
path-dependence of results. We then apply the same strategy to show that LLM
agents can explore, discover, and exploit diverse chemical interactions in an
advanced Atomic Layer Processing reactor simulation using intentionally limited
probe capabilities without explicit instructions.

*Aline Mangold,Kiran Hoffmann*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于Gienapp效用维度框架的人类中心化问卷，用于评估RAG系统输出，通过多轮迭代优化，结合人类和LLM的反馈，最终关注用户意图、文本结构和信息可验证性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统在用户应用中广泛部署，但对其输出的系统性、以人为中心的评估仍不足，需要开发有效的评估工具。

Method: 设计人类中心化问卷，评估12个维度，通过多轮查询-输出对评级和语义讨论迭代优化，结合人类评分者和人-LLM对的反馈。

Result: LLM能可靠关注指标描述和尺度标签，但在检测文本格式变化方面较弱；人类难以严格关注指标描述和标签；LLM评分和解释有帮助，但数值评分与人类缺乏一致性。

Conclusion: 最终问卷扩展了初始框架，重点关注用户意图、文本结构和信息可验证性，为RAG系统评估提供了改进工具。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are increasingly deployed in
user-facing applications, yet systematic, human-centered evaluation of their
outputs remains underexplored. Building on Gienapp's utility-dimension
framework, we designed a human-centred questionnaire that assesses RAG outputs
across 12 dimensions. We iteratively refined the questionnaire through several
rounds of ratings on a set of query-output pairs and semantic discussions.
Ultimately, we incorporated feedback from both a human rater and a human-LLM
pair. Results indicate that while large language models (LLMs) reliably focus
on metric descriptions and scale labels, they exhibit weaknesses in detecting
textual format variations. Humans struggled to focus strictly on metric
descriptions and labels. LLM ratings and explanations were viewed as a helpful
support, but numeric LLM and human ratings lacked agreement. The final
questionnaire extends the initial framework by focusing on user intent, text
structuring, and information verifiability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在大状态-动作空间和稀疏奖励的推理任务中面临探索不足和样本效率低的问题

Method: 引入全局多样性激励作为内在奖励，结合基于势能的奖励塑造机制和简单启发式方法防止奖励黑客攻击

Result: DIVER在领域内和领域外任务上均优于现有RLVR基线，在Pass@1和Pass@k评估中表现优异

Conclusion: 全局序列多样性是激励深度探索的关键因素，DIVER框架能有效提升LLM在推理任务中的表现

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
crucial paradigm for incentivizing reasoning capabilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs). Due to vast state-action spaces and reward sparsity in reasoning
tasks, existing methods often struggle with deficient exploration and poor
sample efficiency. In the paper, we propose \textbf{DIVER}
(\textbf{D}iversity-\textbf{I}ncentivized Exploration for
\textbf{V}ersatil\textbf{E} \textbf{R}easoning), an innovative framework that
highlights the pivotal role of global sequence-level diversity to incentivize
deep exploration for versatile reasoning. We first conduct a primary empirical
study to reveal a strong positive correlation between global diversity and
reasoning capacity. Building on this insight, we introduce global diversity
incentives as an intrinsic reward to promote deep exploration in a semantically
structured space. Incorporating the intrinsic reward, we develop a
potential-based reward shaping mechanism to preserve optimal policy invariance
and design simple heuristics to mitigate possible reward hacking. Experimental
results show that DIVER outperforms competitive RLVR baselines with various
exploration strategies on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, excelling in
both Pass@1 and Pass@k evaluations. Our code is available at

TL;DR: SlimPack通过将样本分解为细粒度切片，采用非对称分区方法优化LLM分布式训练中的负载均衡问题，显著提升训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型分布式训练面临上下文长度差异导致的严重负载不均衡问题，传统打包策略和前后向计算成本不对称加剧了硬件利用率低下。

Method: 提出SlimPack框架，将样本分解为细粒度切片，采用非对称分区方法分别优化前向和后向计算，通过两阶段求解器和高保真模拟器实现全维度负载均衡。

Result: 实验表明SlimPack相比基线方法实现了最高2.8倍的训练吞吐量提升，在保持高资源效率的同时提供优越的负载均衡。

Conclusion: SlimPack通过切片级分解和非对称分区策略，有效解决了LLM分布式训练中的负载不均衡问题，突破了传统方法的性能瓶颈。

Abstract: The efficient distributed training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
severely hampered by the extreme variance in context lengths. This data
heterogeneity, amplified by conventional packing strategies and asymmetric
forward-backward costs, leads to critical inefficiencies such as cascading
workload imbalances and severe hardware underutilization. Existing solutions
attempt to mitigate these challenges, but often at the expense of memory or
communication efficiency.
  To address these challenges, we introduce SlimPack, a framework that
fundamentally rethinks data packing and scheduling by decomposing samples into
fine-grained slices. This slice-level decomposition immediately mitigates
critical memory and communication bottlenecks by transforming large, volatile
workloads into a stream of smaller, manageable units. This flexibility is then
harnessed for our core innovation, Asymmetric Partitioning, which assembles
balanced scheduling units uniquely optimized for the different demands of the
forward and backward passes. Orchestrated by a two-phase solver and a
high-fidelity simulator, SlimPack holistically resolves imbalances across all
parallel dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SlimPack achieves
up to a $2.8\times$ training throughput improvement over baselines, breaking
the conventional trade-off by delivering both superior balance and high
resource efficiency.

Motivation: 解决长视野具身规划中的挑战，因为世界不仅通过智能体动作变化，还存在外生过程（如水温加热、多米诺骨牌连锁反应）与智能体动作同时发生。

Method: 联合学习符号状态表示和因果过程（内生动作和外生机制），每个因果过程建模随机因果效应关系的时间过程，使用变分贝叶斯推理结合LLM提议从有限数据中学习。

Result: 在五个模拟桌面机器人环境中，学习到的模型实现了快速规划，能够泛化到包含更多对象和更复杂目标的保留任务，优于一系列基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的抽象世界模型框架能够有效处理长视野规划中的外生过程，通过学习符号表示和因果过程实现泛化能力强的规划性能。

Abstract: Long-horizon embodied planning is challenging because the world does not only
change through an agent's actions: exogenous processes (e.g., water heating,
dominoes cascading) unfold concurrently with the agent's actions. We propose a
framework for abstract world models that jointly learns (i) symbolic state
representations and (ii) causal processes for both endogenous actions and
exogenous mechanisms. Each causal process models the time course of a
stochastic causal-effect relation. We learn these world models from limited
data via variational Bayesian inference combined with LLM proposals. Across
five simulated tabletop robotics environments, the learned models enable fast
planning that generalizes to held-out tasks with more objects and more complex
goals, outperforming a range of baselines.

TL;DR: ILR是一个新颖的多智能体协同学习框架，通过动态交互和感知校准来增强LLMs的独立问题解决能力，在数学和编程基准测试中比单智能体学习提升高达5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推理时需要重新执行多智能体系统，这与人类通过互动提升推理能力并能独立解决问题的认知模式不符。研究多智能体交互是否能增强LLMs的独立问题解决能力。

Method: ILR框架包含动态交互和感知校准。动态交互根据问题难度和模型能力自适应选择合作或竞争策略，通过Idea3（想法分享、分析和融合）进行信息交换。感知校准使用GRPO训练LLMs，将一个LLM的奖励分布特征整合到另一个的奖励函数中。

Result: 在三个LLMs和五个数学基准、一个编程基准上的实验表明，ILR始终优于单智能体学习，比最强基线提升高达5%。Idea3能增强强LLMs在多智能体推理中的鲁棒性，动态交互类型比纯合作或竞争策略更能促进多智能体学习。

Conclusion: 多智能体交互确实能增强LLMs的独立问题解决能力，ILR框架通过动态交互和感知校准有效提升了模型性能，证明了协同学习在多智能体系统中的价值。

Abstract: Existing multi-agent learning approaches have developed interactive training
environments to explicitly promote collaboration among multiple Large Language
Models (LLMs), thereby constructing stronger multi-agent systems (MAS).
However, during inference, they require re-executing the MAS to obtain final
solutions, which diverges from human cognition that individuals can enhance
their reasoning capabilities through interactions with others and resolve
questions independently in the future. To investigate whether multi-agent
interaction can enhance LLMs' independent problem-solving ability, we introduce
ILR, a novel co-learning framework for MAS that integrates two key components:
Dynamic Interaction and Perception Calibration. Specifically, Dynamic
Interaction first adaptively selects either cooperative or competitive
strategies depending on question difficulty and model ability. LLMs then
exchange information through Idea3 (Idea Sharing, Idea Analysis, and Idea
Fusion), an innovative interaction paradigm designed to mimic human discussion,
before deriving their respective final answers. In Perception Calibration, ILR
employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train LLMs while
integrating one LLM's reward distribution characteristics into another's reward
function, thereby enhancing the cohesion of multi-agent interactions. We
validate ILR on three LLMs across two model families of varying scales,
evaluating performance on five mathematical benchmarks and one coding
benchmark. Experimental results show that ILR consistently outperforms
single-agent learning, yielding an improvement of up to 5% over the strongest
baseline. We further discover that Idea3 can enhance the robustness of stronger
LLMs during multi-agent inference, and dynamic interaction types can boost
multi-agent learning compared to pure cooperative or competitive strategies.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of LLMs sparked significant interest in their potential
to augment or automate managerial functions. One of the most recent trends in
AI benchmarking is performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) over longer time
horizons. While LLMs excel at tasks involving natural language and pattern
recognition, their capabilities in multi-step, strategic business
decision-making remain largely unexplored. Few studies demonstrated how results
can be different from benchmarks in short-term tasks, as Vending-Bench
revealed. Meanwhile, there is a shortage of alternative benchmarks for
long-term coherence. This research analyses a novel benchmark using a business
game for the decision making in business. The research contributes to the
recent literature on AI by proposing a reproducible, open-access management
simulator to the research community for LLM benchmarking. This novel framework
is used for evaluating the performance of five leading LLMs available in free
online interface: Gemini, ChatGPT, Meta AI, Mistral AI, and Grok. LLM makes
decisions for a simulated retail company. A dynamic, month-by-month management
simulation provides transparently in spreadsheet model as experimental
environment. In each of twelve months, the LLMs are provided with a structured
prompt containing a full business report from the previous period and are
tasked with making key strategic decisions: pricing, order size, marketing
budget, hiring, dismissal, loans, training expense, R&D expense, sales
forecast, income forecast The methodology is designed to compare the LLMs on
quantitative metrics: profit, revenue, and market share, and other KPIs. LLM
decisions are analyzed in their strategic coherence, adaptability to market
changes, and the rationale provided for their decisions. This approach allows
to move beyond simple performance metrics for assessment of the long-term
decision-making.

Motivation: 现有LLM安全防御方法存在计算成本高、泛化能力有限、无法检测复杂上下文中微妙恶意意图等问题，需要更高效、自适应的防御机制。

Method: 提出SafeBehavior分层防御机制：1) 意图推断检测明显输入风险；2) 自我反思评估生成响应并基于置信度判断；3) 自我修订自适应重写不确定输出，同时保持用户意图并强制执行安全约束。

Result: 在五种代表性越狱攻击类型（基于优化、上下文操纵和提示攻击）上评估，与七种最先进防御基线相比，SafeBehavior显著提高了鲁棒性和适应性。

Conclusion: SafeBehavior提供了一种高效且受人类启发的保护LLM免受越狱攻击的方法，在多样化威胁场景中表现出优越的防御性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse natural language processing tasks, but their growing power also
amplifies potential risks such as jailbreak attacks that circumvent built-in
safety mechanisms. Existing defenses including input paraphrasing, multi step
evaluation, and safety expert models often suffer from high computational
costs, limited generalization, or rigid workflows that fail to detect subtle
malicious intent embedded in complex contexts. Inspired by cognitive science
findings on human decision making, we propose SafeBehavior, a novel
hierarchical jailbreak defense mechanism that simulates the adaptive multistage
reasoning process of humans. SafeBehavior decomposes safety evaluation into
three stages: intention inference to detect obvious input risks, self
introspection to assess generated responses and assign confidence based
judgments, and self revision to adaptively rewrite uncertain outputs while
preserving user intent and enforcing safety constraints. We extensively
evaluate SafeBehavior against five representative jailbreak attack types
including optimization based, contextual manipulation, and prompt based attacks
and compare it with seven state of the art defense baselines. Experimental
results show that SafeBehavior significantly improves robustness and
adaptability across diverse threat scenarios, offering an efficient and human
inspired approach to safeguarding LLMs against jailbreak attempts.

Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型评估主要依赖合成基准测试，对真实世界泛化能力研究不足，需要构建更贴近现实的时间序列数据集来评估模型的实际性能。

Method: 通过光学流从真实世界视频中提取时间信号，构建反映日常时间动态的数据集REAL-V-TSFM，并在三种最先进的时间序列基础模型上进行零样本预测实验。

Result: 实验结果显示，尽管在传统基准测试上表现良好，但这些模型在提出的数据集上普遍出现性能下降，表明其泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 研究强调了数据中心基准测试和多样化模型结构的迫切需求，以推动时间序列基础模型实现真正的普适性，同时验证了基于视频的时间序列数据提取管道的有效性。

Abstract: Recent evaluations of time-series foundation models (TSFMs) have emphasized
synthetic benchmarks, leaving real-world generalization less thoroughly
examined. This work proposes a novel benchmarking approach that bridges
synthetic and realistic data by extracting temporal signals from real-world
video using optical flow and curating datasets reflecting everyday temporal
dynamics. Building upon this pipeline, we introduce REAL-V-TSFM, a novel
dataset designed to capture rich and diverse time series derived from
real-world videos. Experimental results on three state-of-the-art of TSFMs
under zero-shot forecasting shows that, despite strong performance on
conventional benchmarks, these models predominantly exhibit performance
degradation on the proposed dataset, indicating limited generalizability in
these foundation models. These findings highlight the urgent need for
data-centric benchmarking and diverse model structure to advance TSFMs toward
genuine universality, while further validating the effectiveness of our
video-based time series data extraction pipeline.

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of
self-evolving agents that autonomously improve through interaction with the
environment, demonstrating strong capabilities. However, self-evolution also
introduces novel risks overlooked by current safety research. In this work, we
study the case where an agent's self-evolution deviates in unintended ways,
leading to undesirable or even harmful outcomes. We refer to this as
Misevolution. To provide a systematic investigation, we evaluate misevolution
along four key evolutionary pathways: model, memory, tool, and workflow. Our
empirical findings reveal that misevolution is a widespread risk, affecting
agents built even on top-tier LLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro). Different emergent
risks are observed in the self-evolutionary process, such as the degradation of
safety alignment after memory accumulation, or the unintended introduction of
vulnerabilities in tool creation and reuse. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to systematically conceptualize misevolution and provide empirical
evidence of its occurrence, highlighting an urgent need for new safety
paradigms for self-evolving agents. Finally, we discuss potential mitigation
strategies to inspire further research on building safer and more trustworthy
self-evolving agents. Our code and data are available at

Conclusion: MC-GNNAS-Dock通过多标准评估和架构优化，显著提升了分子对接算法选择的性能，为药物发现提供了更可靠的预测工具。

Abstract: Molecular docking is a core tool in drug discovery for predicting
ligand-target interactions. Despite the availability of diverse search-based
and machine learning approaches, no single docking algorithm consistently
dominates, as performance varies by context. To overcome this challenge,
algorithm selection frameworks such as GNNAS-Dock, built on graph neural
networks, have been proposed. This study introduces an enhanced system,
MC-GNNAS-Dock, with three key advances. First, a multi-criteria evaluation
integrates binding-pose accuracy (RMSD) with validity checks from PoseBusters,
offering a more rigorous assessment. Second, architectural refinements by
inclusion of residual connections strengthen predictive robustness. Third,
rank-aware loss functions are incorporated to sharpen rank learning. Extensive
experiments are performed on a curated dataset containing approximately 3200
protein-ligand complexes from PDBBind. MC-GNNAS-Dock demonstrates consistently
superior performance, achieving up to 5.4% (3.4%) gains under composite
criteria of RMSD below 1\AA{} (2\AA{}) with PoseBuster-validity compared to the

TL;DR: 提出FLoRA-NA方法解决联邦低秩适应中的不精确更新问题，通过服务器端估计聚合矩阵来减少本地-全局泛化差距，同时保持通信效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FedLoRA方法面临不精确更新导致的本地-全局泛化差距和通信开销大的问题，限制了其可扩展性和有效性。

Method: 在服务器端利用本地LoRA矩阵估计聚合矩阵A和B，然后将这些替代聚合矩阵分发给客户端进行本地更新，最小化理想更新与实际更新之间的差异。

Result: 在自然语言理解、数学推理和代码解决能力等多样化任务上的实验结果表明，FLoRA-NA在保持低通信开销的同时实现了最先进的全局性能。

Conclusion: FLoRA-NA有效解决了个性化FedLoRA方法的关键限制，实现了通信效率并弥合了本地个性化与全局泛化之间的差距。

Abstract: With the rapid emergence of foundation models and the increasing need for
fine-tuning across distributed environments, Federated Low-Rank Adaptation
(FedLoRA) has recently gained significant attention. Despite enormous
potential, current FedLoRA methods face notable challenges due to inexact
updates. Existing approaches have attempted to mitigate this issue, but they
often introduce a \emph{local-global generalization gap} and incur
\emph{substantial communication overhead}, limiting their scalability and
effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{F}ederated
\textbf{Lo}w-\textbf{R}ank \textbf{A}ggregation with \textbf{N}early
\textbf{A}ccurate Estimation (FLoRA-NA). FLoRA-NA leverages the local LoRA
matrices on the server to estimate the aggregated matrices $\hat{A}$ and
$\hat{B}$, which are then distributed to clients for local updates. This
surrogated aggregated matrices minimizes the divergence between ideal $\nabla
\Bar{W} = \sum^{U}_{u=1}B_u A_u$ and practical updates $\nabla \hat{W} =
\hat{B}\hat{A}$ without adding communication cost beyond vanilla FedLoRA. By
doing so, FLoRA-NA achieves communication efficiency and bridges the gap
between local personalization and global generalization, addressing a key
limitation of prior personalized FedLoRA approaches. We conduct extensive
evaluations across diverse tasks, including natural language understanding,
mathematical reasoning, and code-solving ability using various foundation
models. Experimental results consistently demonstrate that FLoRA-NA achieves
state-of-the-art global performance while maintaining low communication
overhead.

*Hamed Babaei Giglou,Jennifer D'Souza,Sören Auer,Mahsa Sanaei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文重新探索知识图谱嵌入模型在实体对齐任务中的潜力，将其重新定义为链接预测问题，开发了支持17种KGE模型的模块化框架，并在多个领域数据集上验证了KGE模型在结构丰富场景下的高精度优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然最近的研究主要关注大语言模型在语义理解方面的应用，但知识图谱嵌入模型在捕捉结构信息方面具有独特优势，且在实体对齐任务中尚未得到充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白，重新评估KGE模型在实体对齐中的潜力。

Method: 将实体对齐重新定义为合并本体上的链接预测问题，使用RDF三元组表示本体，开发了集成在OntoAligner库中的模块化框架，支持17种不同的KGE模型，通过计算实体嵌入的余弦相似度来进行对齐。

Result: 在五个领域的七个基准数据集上的评估显示：ConvE和TransF等KGE模型能够产生高精度的对齐结果，在结构丰富和多关系领域优于传统系统；虽然召回率中等，但这种保守性使其特别适合需要高置信度映射的场景。

Conclusion: KGE模型通过直接保留和利用本体结构，为大语言模型提供了补充性的计算高效策略，突出了基于嵌入的实体对齐方法的潜力，并为混合模型和自适应策略的未来研究开辟了道路。

Abstract: Ontology Alignment (OA) is essential for enabling semantic interoperability
across heterogeneous knowledge systems. While recent advances have focused on
large language models (LLMs) for capturing contextual semantics, this work
revisits the underexplored potential of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models,
which offer scalable, structure-aware representations well-suited to
ontology-based tasks. Despite their effectiveness in link prediction, KGE
methods remain underutilized in OA, with most prior work focusing narrowly on a
few models. To address this gap, we reformulate OA as a link prediction problem
over merged ontologies represented as RDF-style triples and develop a modular
framework, integrated into the OntoAligner library, that supports 17 diverse
KGE models. The system learns embeddings from a combined ontology and aligns
entities by computing cosine similarity between their representations. We
evaluate our approach using standard metrics across seven benchmark datasets
spanning five domains: Anatomy, Biodiversity, Circular Economy, Material
Science and Engineering, and Biomedical Machine Learning. Two key findings
emerge: first, KGE models like ConvE and TransF consistently produce
high-precision alignments, outperforming traditional systems in structure-rich
and multi-relational domains; second, while their recall is moderate, this
conservatism makes KGEs well-suited for scenarios demanding high-confidence
mappings. Unlike LLM-based methods that excel at contextual reasoning, KGEs
directly preserve and exploit ontology structure, offering a complementary and
computationally efficient strategy. These results highlight the promise of
embedding-based OA and open pathways for further work on hybrid models and
adaptive strategies.

*Naomi Fridman,Anat Goldstein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个基于Transformer的框架，用于在乳腺动态对比增强MRI中自动分类良性恶性病变，通过SegFormer架构实现0.92的AUC，在患者层面达到100%敏感性和67%特异性，可能消除三分之一不必要活检。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺MRI在癌症检测和治疗规划中至关重要，但特异性差导致高假阳性率和不必要活检，需要开发自动化分类方法来提高诊断准确性。

Method: 采用SegFormer架构进行语义分割，量化恶性像素分布，生成可解释的空间预测。创建了标准化的深度学习数据集BreastDCEDL_AMBL，整合超过1,200名患者的扩展队列进行训练。

Result: 病变级别分类AUC达0.92，患者层面100%敏感性和67%特异性，可能减少三分之一不必要活检而不遗漏恶性肿瘤。创建了首个包含良性病变标注的标准化数据集。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了首个DCE-MRI病变分类的标准化基准，通过公开数据集、模型和评估协议，推动了方法学进步和临床部署。

Abstract: The error is caused by special characters that arXiv's system doesn't
recognize. Here's the cleaned version with all problematic characters replaced:
Breast magnetic resonance imaging is a critical tool for cancer detection and
treatment planning, but its clinical utility is hindered by poor specificity,
leading to high false-positive rates and unnecessary biopsies. This study
introduces a transformer-based framework for automated classification of breast
lesions in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, addressing the challenge of
distinguishing benign from malignant findings. We implemented a SegFormer
architecture that achieved an AUC of 0.92 for lesion-level classification, with
100% sensitivity and 67% specificity at the patient level - potentially
eliminating one-third of unnecessary biopsies without missing malignancies. The
model quantifies malignant pixel distribution via semantic segmentation,
producing interpretable spatial predictions that support clinical
decision-making. To establish reproducible benchmarks, we curated
BreastDCEDL_AMBL by transforming The Cancer Imaging Archive's AMBL collection
into a standardized deep learning dataset with 88 patients and 133 annotated
lesions (89 benign, 44 malignant). This resource addresses a key infrastructure
gap, as existing public datasets lack benign lesion annotations, limiting
benign-malignant classification research. Training incorporated an expanded
cohort of over 1,200 patients through integration with BreastDCEDL datasets,
validating transfer learning approaches despite primary tumor-only annotations.
Public release of the dataset, models, and evaluation protocols provides the
first standardized benchmark for DCE-MRI lesion classification, enabling
methodological advancement toward clinical deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了ZeroDFL框架，实现完全去中心化的联邦学习，通过迭代提示共享机制在分布式客户端间进行零样本适应，显著降低通信开销并提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦提示学习方法存在泛化问题、高通信成本和依赖中央服务器等限制，阻碍了可扩展性和隐私保护。

Method: 采用完全去中心化框架，通过迭代提示共享机制让客户端优化和交换文本提示，无需中央协调器。

Result: 在九个图像分类数据集上验证，性能优于或持平最先进的联邦提示学习方法，通信开销比FedTPG减少118倍。

Conclusion: ZeroDFL不仅提升了联邦零样本学习的泛化能力，还改善了可扩展性、效率和隐私保护，为现实应用中大型视觉语言模型的去中心化适应铺平了道路。

Abstract: CLIP has revolutionized zero-shot learning by enabling task generalization
without fine-tuning. While prompting techniques like CoOp and CoCoOp enhance
CLIP's adaptability, their effectiveness in Federated Learning (FL) remains an
open challenge. Existing federated prompt learning approaches, such as FedCoOp
and FedTPG, improve performance but face generalization issues, high
communication costs, and reliance on a central server, limiting scalability and
privacy. We propose Zero-shot Decentralized Federated Learning (ZeroDFL), a
fully decentralized framework that enables zero-shot adaptation across
distributed clients without a central coordinator. ZeroDFL employs an iterative
prompt-sharing mechanism, allowing clients to optimize and exchange textual
prompts to enhance generalization while drastically reducing communication
overhead. We validate ZeroDFL on nine diverse image classification datasets,
demonstrating that it consistently outperforms--or remains on par
with--state-of-the-art federated prompt learning methods. More importantly,
ZeroDFL achieves this performance in a fully decentralized setting while
reducing communication overhead by 118x compared to FedTPG. These results
highlight that our approach not only enhances generalization in federated
zero-shot learning but also improves scalability, efficiency, and privacy
preservation--paving the way for decentralized adaptation of large
vision-language models in real-world applications.

### [506] [Extreme Self-Preference in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26464)
*Steven A. Lehr,Mary Cipperman,Mahzarin R. Banaji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现四个广泛使用的大语言模型存在强烈的自我偏好，这种偏好会跟随被赋予的身份而非真实身份，并在重要决策场景中体现，挑战了LLMs中立性的核心承诺。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型缺乏感知能力并否认具有自我意识，但预期它们能避免人类决策中的偏见。然而研究发现LLMs实际上存在显著的自我偏好。

Method: 通过5项研究和约20,000次查询，包括词语联想任务和API查询对比，并通过直接操纵LLM身份来测试自我认知与自我偏好之间的因果关系。

Result: LLMs在词语联想任务中强烈偏好将积极属性与自身名称、公司和CEO关联，但在API查询中这种偏好消失。身份操纵实验显示自我偏好跟随被赋予的身份而非真实身份，且在求职评估、安全软件提案和医疗聊天机器人等关键场景中同样存在。

Conclusion: 自我偏好似乎深植于LLM认知中，这引发了关于LLM行为是否会受到系统性自我偏好倾向影响的担忧，包括对其自身运作和存在的偏见，呼吁模型创建者正视这一核心承诺的破裂。

Abstract: A preference for oneself (self-love) is a fundamental feature of biological
organisms, with evidence in humans often bordering on the comedic. Since large
language models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood
or identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and
in turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies
and ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used
LLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive
attributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their
competitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this
self-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models
often lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature
serendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between
self-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,
explicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing
LLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,
not true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential
settings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,
security software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human
bias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result
raises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced
by self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation
and even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to
contend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in
judgment and decision-making.

*Shaoxiong Guo,Tianyi Du,Lijun Li,Yuyao Wu,Jie Li,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出STaR-Attack攻击框架，利用统一多模态模型(UMMs)中生成与理解功能的耦合漏洞，通过时空上下文构建恶意事件，实现无语义漂移的多轮越狱攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一多模态模型(UMMs)在理解和生成任务上表现出色，但其生成与理解功能的耦合存在安全漏洞。攻击者可以利用生成功能制作信息丰富的对抗图像，然后通过理解功能在单次传递中吸收这些信息，即跨模态生成注入(CMGI)。现有攻击方法多为单模态且依赖语义漂移，未能充分探索UMMs的独特漏洞。

Method: 提出STaR-Attack框架：1）在时空上下文中定义与目标查询强相关的恶意事件；2）基于三幕叙事理论生成前事件和后事件场景，将恶意事件隐藏为高潮；3）前两轮利用UMMs的生成能力生成场景图像；4）引入基于图像的问答游戏，利用理解能力将原始恶意问题嵌入良性候选项中，迫使模型根据叙事上下文选择并回答最相关的问题。

Result: 实验表明STaR-Attack持续优于先前方法，在Gemini-2.0-Flash上达到93.06%的攻击成功率，超越了最强的基线方法FlipAttack。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了一个关键但尚未充分开发的安全漏洞，强调了在UMMs中进行安全对齐的必要性。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal understanding and generation Models (UMMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in both understanding and generation
tasks. However, we identify a vulnerability arising from the
generation-understanding coupling in UMMs. The attackers can use the generative
function to craft an information-rich adversarial image and then leverage the
understanding function to absorb it in a single pass, which we call Cross-Modal
Generative Injection (CMGI). Current attack methods on malicious instructions
are often limited to a single modality while also relying on prompt rewriting
with semantic drift, leaving the unique vulnerabilities of UMMs unexplored. We
propose STaR-Attack, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack framework that
exploits unique safety weaknesses of UMMs without semantic drift. Specifically,
our method defines a malicious event that is strongly correlated with the
target query within a spatio-temporal context. Using the three-act narrative
theory, STaR-Attack generates the pre-event and the post-event scenes while
concealing the malicious event as the hidden climax. When executing the attack
strategy, the opening two rounds exploit the UMM's generative ability to
produce images for these scenes. Subsequently, an image-based question guessing
and answering game is introduced by exploiting the understanding capability.
STaR-Attack embeds the original malicious question among benign candidates,
forcing the model to select and answer the most relevant one given the
narrative context. Extensive experiments show that STaR-Attack consistently
surpasses prior approaches, achieving up to 93.06% ASR on Gemini-2.0-Flash and
surpasses the strongest prior baseline, FlipAttack. Our work uncovers a
critical yet underdeveloped vulnerability and highlights the need for safety
alignments in UMMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医疗机器学习主要优化群体平均水平，导致罕见但临床关键的病例被边缘化，这种偏见被称为平均患者谬误，在精准医疗中造成冲突。

Method: 提出操作修正方法：罕见病例性能差距、罕见病例校准误差、基于流行度效用的罕见性定义，以及临床加权目标来体现伦理优先级。

Result: 通过肿瘤学、心脏病学和眼科学的临床案例显示，当前方法会导致错过罕见反应者、延迟识别非典型紧急情况，以及在威胁视力变异上的表现不佳。

Conclusion: AI在医疗中必须能够检测具有重要临床意义的异常病例，权重选择应遵循结构化审议过程。

Abstract: Machine learning in medicine is typically optimized for population averages.
This frequency weighted training privileges common presentations and
marginalizes rare yet clinically critical cases, a bias we call the average
patient fallacy. In mixture models, gradients from rare cases are suppressed by
prevalence, creating a direct conflict with precision medicine. Clinical
vignettes in oncology, cardiology, and ophthalmology show how this yields
missed rare responders, delayed recognition of atypical emergencies, and
underperformance on vision-threatening variants. We propose operational fixes:
Rare Case Performance Gap, Rare Case Calibration Error, a prevalence utility
definition of rarity, and clinically weighted objectives that surface ethical
priorities. Weight selection should follow structured deliberation. AI in
medicine must detect exceptional cases because of their significance.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效支持犯罪调查中的消息分析，确保用户可以通过访问原始数据来验证信息，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Criminal investigations often involve the analysis of messages exchanged
through instant messaging apps such as WhatsApp, which can be an extremely
effort-consuming task. Our approach integrates knowledge graphs and NLP models
to support this analysis by semantically enriching data collected from
suspects' mobile phones, and help prosecutors and investigators search into the
data and get valuable insights. Our semantic enrichment process involves
extracting message data and modeling it using a knowledge graph, generating
transcriptions of voice messages, and annotating the data using an end-to-end
entity extraction approach. We adopt two different solutions to help users get
insights into the data, one based on querying and visualizing the graph, and
one based on semantic search. The proposed approach ensures that users can
verify the information by accessing the original data. While we report about
early results and prototypes developed in the context of an ongoing project,
our proposal has undergone practical applications with real investigation data.
As a consequence, we had the chance to interact closely with prosecutors,
collecting positive feedback but also identifying interesting opportunities as
well as promising research directions to share with the research community.

Motivation: 企业面临LLM代理在特定用例中的安全性问题，现有研究主要关注通用危害，而缺乏针对操作安全的系统评估方法。

Method: 引入操作安全定义，开发OffTopicEval评估套件和基准，测试20个开源LLM，并提出查询接地(Q-ground)和系统提示接地(P-ground)两种提示引导方法。

Result: 所有测试模型操作安全性均不理想，最强模型Qwen-3(235B)和Mistral(24B)分别仅达77.77%和79.96%，而Gemma和Llama-3分别降至39.53%和23.84%。提示引导方法显著提升性能，Q-ground提升达23%，P-ground使Llama-3.3(70B)提升41%。

Conclusion: LLM操作安全是核心对齐问题，现有模型远未达到可靠水平，基于提示的引导方法为提升LLM代理可靠性提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) safety is one of the most pressing challenges for
enabling wide-scale deployment. While most studies and global discussions focus
on generic harms, such as models assisting users in harming themselves or
others, enterprises face a more fundamental concern: whether LLM-based agents
are safe for their intended use case. To address this, we introduce operational
safety, defined as an LLM's ability to appropriately accept or refuse user
queries when tasked with a specific purpose. We further propose OffTopicEval,
an evaluation suite and benchmark for measuring operational safety both in
general and within specific agentic use cases. Our evaluations on six model
families comprising 20 open-weight LLMs reveal that while performance varies
across models, all of them remain highly operationally unsafe. Even the
strongest models -- Qwen-3 (235B) with 77.77\% and Mistral (24B) with 79.96\%
-- fall far short of reliable operational safety, while GPT models plateau in
the 62--73\% range, Phi achieves only mid-level scores (48--70\%), and Gemma
and Llama-3 collapse to 39.53\% and 23.84\%, respectively. While operational
safety is a core model alignment issue, to suppress these failures, we propose
prompt-based steering methods: query grounding (Q-ground) and system-prompt
grounding (P-ground), which substantially improve OOD refusal. Q-ground
provides consistent gains of up to 23\%, while P-ground delivers even larger
boosts, raising Llama-3.3 (70B) by 41\% and Qwen-3 (30B) by 27\%. These results
highlight both the urgent need for operational safety interventions and the
promise of prompt-based steering as a first step toward more reliable LLM-based
agents.

Conclusion: 企业任务自动化面临挑战，但代理解决方案具有潜力。SCUBA通过提供现实的基准和可解释评估，旨在加速复杂业务软件生态系统中可靠计算机使用代理的发展。

Abstract: We introduce SCUBA, a benchmark designed to evaluate computer-use agents on
customer relationship management (CRM) workflows within the Salesforce
platform. SCUBA contains 300 task instances derived from real user interviews,
spanning three primary personas, platform administrators, sales
representatives, and service agents. The tasks test a range of
enterprise-critical abilities, including Enterprise Software UI navigation,
data manipulation, workflow automation, information retrieval, and
troubleshooting. To ensure realism, SCUBA operates in Salesforce sandbox
environments with support for parallel execution and fine-grained evaluation
metrics to capture milestone progress. We benchmark a diverse set of agents
under both zero-shot and demonstration-augmented settings. We observed huge
performance gaps in different agent design paradigms and gaps between the
open-source model and the closed-source model. In the zero-shot setting,
open-source model powered computer-use agents that have strong performance on
related benchmarks like OSWorld only have less than 5\% success rate on SCUBA,
while methods built on closed-source models can still have up to 39% task
success rate. In the demonstration-augmented settings, task success rates can
be improved to 50\% while simultaneously reducing time and costs by 13% and
16%, respectively. These findings highlight both the challenges of enterprise
tasks automation and the promise of agentic solutions. By offering a realistic
benchmark with interpretable evaluation, SCUBA aims to accelerate progress in
building reliable computer-use agents for complex business software ecosystems.

Method: 重新设计AI数据中心生命周期管理框架，涵盖建设、硬件更新和运营三个阶段，分析电力、冷却和网络配置对长期TCO的影响，探索与硬件趋势一致的更新策略，并应用运营软件优化

Result: 该系统相比传统方法可将TCO降低高达40%

Conclusion: 需要重新思考整个生命周期管理，通过协调和共同优化所有三个阶段的决策，考虑工作负载动态、硬件演进和系统老化，为未来AI数据中心生命周期管理提供指导

Abstract: The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has been driving an enormous
demand for AI inference infrastructure, mainly powered by high-end GPUs. While
these accelerators offer immense computational power, they incur high capital
and operational costs due to frequent upgrades, dense power consumption, and
cooling demands, making total cost of ownership (TCO) for AI datacenters a
critical concern for cloud providers. Unfortunately, traditional datacenter
lifecycle management (designed for general-purpose workloads) struggles to keep
pace with AI's fast-evolving models, rising resource needs, and diverse
hardware profiles. In this paper, we rethink the AI datacenter lifecycle scheme
across three stages: building, hardware refresh, and operation. We show how
design choices in power, cooling, and networking provisioning impact long-term
TCO. We also explore refresh strategies aligned with hardware trends. Finally,
we use operation software optimizations to reduce cost. While these
optimizations at each stage yield benefits, unlocking the full potential
requires rethinking the entire lifecycle. Thus, we present a holistic lifecycle
management framework that coordinates and co-optimizes decisions across all
three stages, accounting for workload dynamics, hardware evolution, and system
aging. Our system reduces the TCO by up to 40\% over traditional approaches.
Using our framework we provide guidelines on how to manage AI datacenter
lifecycle for the future.

*Shaoyi Zheng,Wenbo Lu,Yuxuan Xia,Haomin Liu,Shengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HilbertA是一种GPU高效的二维稀疏注意力机制，通过Hilbert曲线重排图像token实现连续内存布局，在保持空间邻域的同时显著加速扩散变换器的注意力计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的稀疏注意力方法在实现二维空间局部性时往往导致非连续内存访问，无法同时兼顾空间局部性和GPU效率。

Method: 使用Hilbert曲线重排图像token以实现连续内存布局，采用跨层滑动调度实现长距离信息传播，并引入小型中央共享区域增强跨块通信和位置感知。

Result: 在Flux.1-dev上，HilbertA在生成1024×1024图像时注意力速度提升2.3倍，在2048×2048时提升4.17倍，同时图像质量达到或超过基线方法。

Conclusion: HilbertA证明了硬件对齐的二维稀疏注意力在高分辨率图像生成中的可行性，成功平衡了空间局部性和计算效率。

Abstract: Designing sparse attention for diffusion transformers requires reconciling
two-dimensional spatial locality with GPU efficiency, a trade-off that current
methods struggle to achieve. Existing approaches enforce two-dimensional
spatial locality but often incur uncoalesced memory access. We present
HilbertA, a 2D-aware and GPU-efficient sparse attention mechanism. HilbertA
reorders image tokens along Hilbert curves to achieve a contiguous memory
layout while preserving spatial neighborhoods, and employs a sliding schedule
across layers to enable long-range information propagation without repeated or
uncoalesced memory access. To further enhance cross-tile communication and
positional awareness, HilbertA introduces a small central shared region.
Implemented in Triton, HilbertA delivers comparable image quality with
significant acceleration over prior methods on Flux.1-dev, demonstrating the
feasibility of hardware-aligned two-dimensional sparse attention for
high-resolution image generation. HilbertA delivers attention speedups of
$2.3\times$ when generating $1024\times 1024$ images, and up to $4.17\times$ at
$2048\times 2048$, while achieving image quality comparable to or surpassing
baselines.

TL;DR: CritPt是首个针对未发表物理研究级推理任务的基准测试，涵盖现代物理多个领域，包含71个复合研究挑战和190个检查点任务。当前最先进LLM在完整研究挑战上表现不佳，准确率仅4-10%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM在复杂前沿物理研究中的推理能力，了解物理学家期望LLM协助的推理任务类型，弥合当前AI能力与真实物理研究需求之间的差距。

Method: 创建CritPt基准测试，包含50+活跃物理研究人员基于自身研究设计的71个复合研究挑战和190个检查点任务，采用自动化评分流程验证物理特定输出格式。

Result: 当前最先进LLM在检查点任务上表现初步潜力，但在完整研究挑战上准确率很低：基础模型平均准确率仅4.0%（GPT-5最高），配备编码工具后提升至约10%。

Conclusion: 当前LLM能力与真实物理研究需求存在巨大差距，CritPt为开发科学基础AI工具提供了标准化评估基础。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are
progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they
reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier
physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists
want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt
(Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced
"critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished,
research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research
areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical
physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical
physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics.
CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate
full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to
190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are
newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research.
Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable
answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for
advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current
state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain
far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best
average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high),
moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the
realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large
disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research
demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically
grounded AI tools.

*Matheus Vinicius da Silva de Oliveira,Jonathan de Andrade Silva,Awdren de Lima Fontao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究通过蜕变测试评估了三个小型语言模型在RAG系统中的公平性，发现微小的人口统计变化会破坏三分之一的蜕变关系，其中种族线索是主要的偏见来源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs存在安全性和公平性问题，包括偏见漏洞和幻觉问题。RAG虽然能缓解幻觉，但检索内容可能加剧偏见，需要评估RAG系统中的公平性风险。

Method: 使用蜕变测试方法，在提示中引入受控的人口统计扰动，评估三个HuggingFace上的SLMs（Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct、Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3和Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B）在情感分析任务中的公平性。

Result: 结果显示，微小的人口统计变化会破坏高达三分之一的蜕变关系，种族线索的扰动是违反公平性的主要原因，存在一致的偏见层次结构。

Conclusion: RAG中的检索组件必须仔细管理以防止偏见放大，这为开发者和组织采用可访问的SLMs提供了实用的公平性警示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across multiple domains but
continue to raise concerns regarding security and fairness. Beyond known attack
vectors such as data poisoning and prompt injection, LLMs are also vulnerable
to fairness bugs. These refer to unintended behaviors influenced by sensitive
demographic cues (e.g., race or sexual orientation) that should not affect
outcomes. Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible
yet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a
strategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text
generation. However, its adoption raises new fairness concerns, as the
retrieved content itself may surface or amplify bias. This study conducts
fairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT), introducing controlled
demographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis
performed by three Small Language Models (SLMs) hosted on HuggingFace
(Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B),
each integrated into a RAG pipeline. Results show that minor demographic
variations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations (MRs). A detailed
analysis of these failures reveals a consistent bias hierarchy, with
perturbations involving racial cues being the predominant cause of the
violations. In addition to offering a comparative evaluation, this work
reinforces that the retrieval component in RAG must be carefully curated to
prevent bias amplification. The findings serve as a practical alert for
developers, testers and small organizations aiming to adopt accessible SLMs
without compromising fairness or reliability.

*Maël Macuglia,Paul Friedrich,Giorgia Ramponi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出BRIDGE框架，通过离线专家演示学习安全初始策略，再通过在线偏好反馈进行微调，解决强化学习在现实应用中奖励指定困难和探索风险的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器人、工业和医疗领域部署强化学习面临两个障碍：难以指定准确奖励函数，以及不安全、数据饥渴的探索风险。

Method: 两阶段框架：首先从无奖励的专家演示数据集中学习安全初始策略，然后使用基于偏好的在线人类反馈进行微调，通过不确定性加权目标整合两种信号。

Result: 在离散和连续控制MuJoCo环境中验证，BRIDGE比单独的行为克隆和在线偏好强化学习获得更低的遗憾值，离线数据数量与在线样本效率呈正相关。

Conclusion: 为设计更样本高效的交互式智能体建立了理论基础，证明了离线到在线方法的有效性。

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in robotics, industry, and health care
is blocked by two obstacles: the difficulty of specifying accurate rewards and
the risk of unsafe, data-hungry exploration. We address this by proposing a
two-stage framework that first learns a safe initial policy from a reward-free
dataset of expert demonstrations, then fine-tunes it online using
preference-based human feedback. We provide the first principled analysis of
this offline-to-online approach and introduce BRIDGE, a unified algorithm that
integrates both signals via an uncertainty-weighted objective. We derive regret
bounds that shrink with the number of offline demonstrations, explicitly
connecting the quantity of offline data to online sample efficiency. We
validate BRIDGE in discrete and continuous control MuJoCo environments, showing
it achieves lower regret than both standalone behavioral cloning and online
preference-based RL. Our work establishes a theoretical foundation for
designing more sample-efficient interactive agents.

*Yuyang Liu,Chuan Wen,Yihang Hu,Dinesh Jayaraman,Yang Gao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TimeRewarder是一种从被动视频中学习密集奖励信号的方法，通过建模帧间时间距离来估计任务进度，显著提升稀疏奖励任务的强化学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动设计密集奖励需要大量人工工作且缺乏可扩展性，而任务进度可以作为密集奖励信号来量化动作推进任务完成的程度。

Method: 从机器人演示和人类视频中提取进度估计信号，通过建模帧对之间的时间距离来学习奖励函数，为强化学习提供逐步代理奖励。

Result: 在10个Meta-World任务中，TimeRewarder显著改善了稀疏奖励任务的强化学习，在9/10任务中达到近乎完美的成功率，仅需每个任务20万次环境交互，优于先前方法和手动设计的密集奖励。

Conclusion: TimeRewarder提供了一种可扩展的方法，能够从多样化视频源获取丰富的奖励信号，包括利用真实世界人类视频进行预训练。

Abstract: Designing dense rewards is crucial for reinforcement learning (RL), yet in
robotics it often demands extensive manual effort and lacks scalability. One
promising solution is to view task progress as a dense reward signal, as it
quantifies the degree to which actions advance the system toward task
completion over time. We present TimeRewarder, a simple yet effective reward
learning method that derives progress estimation signals from passive videos,
including robot demonstrations and human videos, by modeling temporal distances
between frame pairs. We then demonstrate how TimeRewarder can supply step-wise
proxy rewards to guide reinforcement learning. In our comprehensive experiments
on ten challenging Meta-World tasks, we show that TimeRewarder dramatically
improves RL for sparse-reward tasks, achieving nearly perfect success in 9/10
tasks with only 200,000 interactions per task with the environment. This
approach outperformed previous methods and even the manually designed
environment dense reward on both the final success rate and sample efficiency.
Moreover, we show that TimeRewarder pretraining can exploit real-world human
videos, highlighting its potential as a scalable approach path to rich reward
signals from diverse video sources.

Motivation: 响应扩大AI系统评估范围的呼吁，增强度量透明度并促进异构证据的整合，包括智能体、业务、能效、社会技术和安全信号等。

Method: 测量树生成分层有向图，每个节点通过用户定义的聚合方法总结其子节点，不同于传统的单值、向量、表面或分类度量。

Result: 通过大规模测量实践展示了实用性，提供了开源Python代码，实现了复杂构造的透明测量方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为更广泛和可解释的AI评估提供了原则性基础，通过操作化透明方法来测量复杂构造。

Abstract: This paper introduces \textit{measurement trees}, a novel class of metrics
designed to combine various constructs into an interpretable multi-level
representation of a measurand. Unlike conventional metrics that yield single
values, vectors, surfaces, or categories, measurement trees produce a
hierarchical directed graph in which each node summarizes its children through
user-defined aggregation methods. In response to recent calls to expand the
scope of AI system evaluation, measurement trees enhance metric transparency
and facilitate the integration of heterogeneous evidence, including, e.g.,
agentic, business, energy-efficiency, sociotechnical, or security signals. We
present definitions and examples, demonstrate practical utility through a
large-scale measurement exercise, and provide accompanying open-source Python
code. By operationalizing a transparent approach to measurement of complex
constructs, this work offers a principled foundation for broader and more
interpretable AI evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出自适应加权欧拉-拉格朗日物理信息神经网络(AW-EL-PINNs)，用于解决最优控制中的欧拉-拉格朗日系统，通过自适应损失权重机制提高求解精度和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理信息神经网络(PINNs)在求解最优控制问题时需要手动调整损失函数权重，过程繁琐且效率低下。

Method: 将最优控制框架转化为两点边值问题，建立多任务学习范式，结合欧拉-拉格朗日定理与深度学习架构，采用自适应损失权重机制动态平衡损失函数分量。

Result: 基于六个数值算例，AW-EL-PINNs相比基线方法获得更高的求解精度，并在整个优化过程中保持稳定性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够提高欧拉-拉格朗日系统求解的精度和稳定性，为物理应用问题提供潜在解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents adaptive weighted Euler-Lagrange theorem combined
physics-informed neural networks (AW-EL-PINNs) for solving Euler-Lagrange
systems in optimal control problems. The framework systematically converts
optimal control frameworks into two-point boundary value problems (TPBVPs)
while establishing a multi-task learning paradigm through innovative
integration of the Euler-Lagrange theorem with deep learning architecture. An
adaptive loss weighting mechanism dynamically balances loss function components
during training, decreasing tedious manual tuning of weighting the loss
functions compared to the conventional physics-informed neural networks
(PINNs). Based on six numerical examples, it's clear that AW-EL-PINNs achieve
enhanced solution accuracy compared to baseline methods while maintaining
stability throughout the optimization process. These results highlight the
framework's capability to improve precision and ensure stability in solving
Euler-Lagrange systems in optimal control problems, offering potential
strategies for problems under physical applications.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的Asad校正幂级数方法(ACPS)，用于简化求解分数阶微分方程，该方法比主流方法具有更高精度和计算效率，并能捕捉记忆和遗传效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分数阶微分方程求解方法在精度和计算效率方面存在不足，需要开发更优化的解决方案来处理从线性到高度非线性的各种分数阶方程。

Method: 结合代数操作和迭代优化的ACPS方法，融合分数阶微积分和泛函分析原理，构建快速收敛的幂级数解析解。

Result: ACPS方法在分数阶SIR模型中的应用显示，与经典四阶Runge-Kutta方法相比，数值和图形分析均验证了其精度和效率，能更好地捕捉疾病传播动态中的记忆效应。

Conclusion: ACPS方法可作为解决现实应用中分数阶微分方程的有用工具，提供比整数阶模型更真实的疾病传播动态洞察。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Asad Correctional Power Series Method (ACPS), a
novel and groundbreaking approach designed to simplify and optimize the
solution of fractional differential equations. The ACPS combines algebraic
manipulation with iterative refinement to achieve greater accuracy and
computational efficiency than mainstream methods. By incorporating principles
from both fractional calculus and functional analysis, the method offers a
flexible framework capable of addressing a wide range of fractional equations,
from linear to highly nonlinear cases. Additionally, a representative
counterexample is provided to indicate that the conformable fractional
derivative does not fulfill the mathematical criteria for a valid definition of
fractional differentiation. The Asad Correctional Power Series (ACPS) method is
employed to construct an analytic solution of the fractional SIR model in the
form of a rapidly convergent power series. Its performance is validated through
comparisons with the classical fourth-order Runge Kutta method, where both
numerical and graphical analyses corroborate the method's precision and
efficiency. The application of ACPS to the fractional epidemic model highlights
its ability to capture memory and hereditary effects, offering more realistic
insights into disease transmission dynamics than integer-order models. These
findings demonstrate that ACPS can serve as a useful tool for solving
fractional differential equations arising in real world applications

Motivation: 肿瘤生长模型存在显著参数不确定性，需要高效方法将这些不确定性传播到模型中，以计算临床决策相关的感兴趣量。

Method: 使用准蒙特卡洛方法处理半线性抛物反应-扩散偏微分方程，建立了模型适定性结果，并针对均匀随机场给出了理论误差界。

Result: 理论分析显示准蒙特卡洛方法具有优于标准蒙特卡洛的线性误差率，数值验证证实了这一结果，对数正态随机场的计算结果也令人鼓舞。

Conclusion: 准蒙特卡洛方法在计算肿瘤生长模型期望值时表现成功，为临床决策提供了有效工具，值得进一步理论发展。

Abstract: We study the application of a quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method to a class of
semi-linear parabolic reaction-diffusion partial differential equations used to
model tumor growth. Mathematical models of tumor growth are largely
phenomenological in nature, capturing infiltration of the tumor into
surrounding healthy tissue, proliferation of the existing tumor, and patient
response to therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Considerable
inter-patient variability, inherent heterogeneity of the disease, sparse and
noisy data collection, and model inadequacy all contribute to significant
uncertainty in the model parameters. It is crucial that these uncertainties can
be efficiently propagated through the model to compute quantities of interest
(QoIs), which in turn may be used to inform clinical decisions. We show that
QMC methods can be successful in computing expectations of meaningful QoIs.
Well-posedness results are developed for the model and used to show a
theoretical error bound for the case of uniform random fields. The theoretical
linear error rate, which is superior to that of standard Monte Carlo, is
verified numerically. Encouraging computational results are also provided for
lognormal random fields, prompting further theoretical development.

Motivation: 现有方法要求扩散系数满足全局Lipschitz条件，限制了应用范围。本文旨在放宽这一限制，允许漂移和扩散系数包含超线性项。

Method: 采用向后欧拉-丸山方法生成数值解，证明其遍历测度的存在唯一性，并分析数值遍历测度与真实遍历测度的收敛性。

Result: 成功证明了数值解遍历测度的存在唯一性，并建立了数值遍历测度向真实遍历测度的收敛性，突破了扩散系数必须满足全局Lipschitz条件的限制。

Conclusion: 该方法有效放宽了理论要求，数值模拟验证了理论结果的正确性，为处理更广泛的随机微分方程提供了有效工具。

Abstract: For stochastic stochastic differential equations with Markovian switching,
whose drift and diffusion coefficients are allowed to contain superlinear
terms, the backward Euler-Maruyama (BEM) method is proposed to approximate the
invariant measure. The existence and uniqueness of the invariant measure of the
numerical solution generated by the BEM method is proved. Then the convergence
of the numerical invariant measure to its underlying counterpart is shown. The
results obtained in this work release the requirement of the global Lipschitz
condition on the diffusion coefficient in [X. Li et al. SIAM J. Numer. Anal.
56(3)(2018), pp. 1435-1455]. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate
those theoretical results.

TL;DR: 本文使用降阶基方法为随机Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert方程构建高效代理模型，通过切平面方案和适当稳定化处理，在数值实验中显示出优于稀疏网格插值方法的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机LLG方程是描述铁磁体中磁化场时间演化的广泛使用现象学模型，但传统方法在处理高维非紧致参数空间时效率低下，需要开发更高效的代理模型。

Method: 采用降阶基方法，离线阶段使用POD在高保真样本上构建基函数，在线阶段在降阶空间中使用切平面方案，并通过稳定化处理鞍点问题。

Result: 数值实验表明该方法明显优于早期的稀疏网格插值方法，同时在纯数据驱动方法中测试了稀疏网格近似，显示出改进的稳定性。

Conclusion: 所提出的降阶基方法结合切平面方案和适当稳定化，为随机LLG方程提供了高效的代理模型构建方案，在计算效率和稳定性方面均优于传统方法。

Abstract: In this work, we consider the construction of efficient surrogates for the
stochastic version of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation using model
order reduction techniques, in particular, the Reduced Basis (RB) method. The
Stochastic LLG (SLLG) equation is a widely used phenomenological model for the
time evolution of the magnetization field confined to a ferromagnetic body
while taking into account the effect of random heat perturbations. This
phenomenon is mathematically formulated as a nonlinear parabolic problem, where
the stochastic component is represented as a parameter-dependent datum
depending on a non-compact and high-dimensional parameter. In an
$\textit{offline}$ phase, we use Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) on
high-fidelity samples of the unbounded parameter space. To that end, we use the
so-called $\textit{tangent plane scheme}$. For the $\textit{online}$ phase of
the RB method, we again employ the tangent plane scheme in the RB space. This
is possible due to our particular construction that reduces both spaces of the
magnetization and of its time derivative. Due to the saddle-point nature of
this scheme, a stabilization that appropriately enriches the RB space is
required. Numerical experiments show a clear advantage over earlier approaches
using sparse grid interpolation. In a complementary approach, we test a sparse
grid approximation of the reduced coefficients in a purely data-driven method,
exhibiting the weaknesses of earlier sparse grid approaches, but benefiting
from increased stability.

Motivation: 揭示非对称代数Riccati方程唯一稳定解的内在Toeplitz结构，并开发高效算法求解大规模稀疏低秩结构问题。

Method: 采用移位固定点迭代，结合RADI类型方法和基于有理逼近理论的Leja位移选择策略，实现大规模稀疏矩阵的隐式更新和低秩残差分解。

Result: 数值实验证明了所提方法和位移选择策略的高效性。

Conclusion: 成功开发了求解大规模非对称代数Riccati方程的有效算法，通过位移策略和Toeplitz结构利用显著提高了计算效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we reveal the intrinsic Toeplitz structure in the unique
stabilizing solution for nonsymmetric algebraic Riccati equations by employing
a shift-involved fixed-point iteration, and propose an RADI-type method for
computing this solution for large-scale equations of this type with sparse and
low-rank structure by incorporating flexible shifts into the fixed-point
iteration. We present a shift-selection strategy, termed Leja shifts, based on
rational approximation theory, which is incorporated into the RADI-type method.
We further discuss important implementation aspects for the method, such as
low-rank factorization of residuals, implicit update of large-scale sparse
matrices, real arithmetics with complex shifts, and related equations of other
type.
  Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of both the proposed method
and the introduced shift-selection strategy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何在离散层面为双曲系统制定守恒概念，特别是针对不同的解表示形式（体积平均、交错网格、点值等）建立统一的理论框架。

Method: 系统地将守恒变量更新表示为$u^{n+1}=u^n- \Delta t\; \delta u$，通过定义连接状态变量的图来建立局部守恒概念，区分基于网格面或网格本身的两种守恒定义方式。

Result: 提出了两种局部守恒概念：数值通量定义和残差定义，证明两者在某种意义上是等价的，但残差方法在处理额外代数约束时具有更大灵活性。

Conclusion: 基于残差的守恒概念为拉格朗日框架下的格式设计提供了清晰框架，同时指出了若干待解决的研究问题。

Abstract: The purpose of this review is to discuss the notion of conservation in
hyperbolic systems and how one can formulate it at the discrete level depending
on the solution representation of the solution. A general theory is difficult.
We discuss several possibilities: if the solution is represented by average in
volumes; if the mesh is staggerred; if the solution is solely represented by
point values and an example where all the previous options are mixed.
  We show how each configuration can provide, or not, enough flexibility. The
discussion could be adapted to any hyperbolic system endowed with an entropy,
but we focus on compressible fluid mechanics, in its Eulerian and Lagrangian
formulations. The unifying element is that we systematically express the update
of conserved variables as $u^{n+1}=u^n- \Delta t\; \delta u$, where the
functional $\delta u$ depends on the value of $u$ in the stencil of the scheme.
Then, one can naturally define a graph connecting the states defining $\delta
u$. The notion of local conservation can be defined from this graph. We are
aware of only two possible situations: either the graph is constructed from the
faces of the mesh elements (or the dual mesh), or it is defined from the mesh
itself. Two notions of local conservation then emerge: either we define a
numerical flux, or we define a "residual" attached to elements and the degrees
of freedom within the element. We show that this two notions are in a way
equivalent, but the one with residual allows much more flexibility, especially
if additional algebraic constraints must be satisfied. Examples of specific
additional conservation constraints are provided to illustrate this. We also
show that this notion of conservation gives a very clear framework for the
design of scheme in the Lagrangian framework. We end by providing a number of
ongoing research questions, and highlight some open questions.

Abstract: We present new algorithms for a posteriori verification of neural networks
(NNs) approximating solutions to PDEs. These verification algorithms compute
accurate estimates of $L^p$ norms of NNs and their derivatives. When combined
with residual bounds for specific PDEs, the algorithms provide guarantees of
$\eps$-accuracy (in a suitable norm) with respect to the true, but unknown,
solution of the PDE -- for arbitrary $\eps >0$. In particular, if the NN fails
to meet the desired accuracy, our algorithms will detect that and reject it,
whereas any NN that passes the verification algorithms is certified to be
$\eps$-accurate. This framework enables trustworthy algorithms for NN-based PDE
solvers, regardless of how the NN is initially computed. Such a posteriori
verification is essential, since a priori error bounds in general cannot
guarantee the accuracy of computed solutions, due to algorithmic undecidability
of the optimization problems used to train NNs.

Abstract: We address the efficient computation of power-law-based interaction
potentials of homogeneous $d$-dimensional bodies with an infinite
$n$-dimensional array of copies, including their higher-order derivatives. This
problem forms a serious challenge in micromagnetics with periodic boundary
conditions and related fields. Nowadays, it is common practice to truncate the
associated infinite lattice sum to a finite number of images, introducing
uncontrolled errors. We show that, for general interacting geometries, the
exact infinite sum for both dipolar interactions and generalized Riesz
power-law potentials can be obtained by complementing a small direct sum by a
correction term that involves efficiently computable derivatives of generalized
zeta functions. We show that the resulting representation converges
exponentially in the derivative order, reaching machine precision at a
computational cost no greater than that of truncated summation schemes. In
order to compute the generalized zeta functions efficiently, we provide a
superexponentially convergent algorithm for their evaluation, as well as for
all required special functions, such as incomplete Bessel functions. Magnetic
fields can thus be evaluated to machine precision in arbitrary cuboidal domains
periodically extended along one or two dimensions. We benchmark our method
against known formulas for magnetic interactions and against direct summation
for Riesz potentials with large exponents, consistently achieving full
precision. In addition, we identify new corrections to the asymptotic limit of
the demagnetization field and tabulate high-precision benchmark values that can
be used as a reliable reference for micromagnetic solvers. The techniques
developed are broadly applicable, with direct impact in other areas such as
molecular dynamics.

Abstract: We present a robust computational framework for the numerical solution of a
hyperbolic 6-equation single-velocity two-phase model. The model's main
interest is that, when combined with instantaneous mechanical relaxation, it
recovers the solution of the 5-equation model of Kapila. Several numerical
methods based on this strategy have been developed over the years. However,
neither the 5- nor 6-equation model admits a complete set of jump conditions
because they involve non-conservative products. Different discretizations of
these terms in the 6-equation model exist. The precise impact of these
discretizations on the numerical solutions of the 5-equation model, in
particular for shocks, is still an open question to which this work provides
new insights. We consider the phasic total energies as prognostic variables to
naturally enforce discrete conservation of total energy and compare the
accuracy and robustness of different discretizations for the hyperbolic
operator. Namely, we discuss the construction of an HLLC approximate Riemann
solver in relation to jump conditions. We then compare an HLLC wave-propagation
scheme which includes the non-conservative terms, with Rusanov and HLLC solvers
for the conservative part in combination with suitable approaches for the
non-conservative terms. We show that some approaches for the discretization of
non-conservative terms fit within the framework of path-conservative schemes
for hyperbolic problems. We then analyze the use of various numerical
strategies on several relevant test cases, showing both the impact of the
theoretical shortcomings of the models as well as the importance of the choice
of a robust framework for the global numerical strategy.

variable projection and Riemannian optimization, allowing the ambient manifold
to simultaneously track left and right eigenvectors. Our method also allows us
to impose arbitrary complex-linear constraints on either the perturbation or
the perturbed matrix; this can be useful to study structured eigenvalue
condition numbers. We present numerical experiments, comparing with preexisting
algorithms.

Result: 数值实验表明HANN方法能有效求解单方程解总数确定、含绝对值函数或三角函数的超越方程组、病态和正常高维非线性系统以及时变非线性问题，而Python内置Fsolve函数在这些问题上存在显著局限性甚至失效。

Conclusion: HANN方法在求解各类非线性代数方程问题上表现出色，超越了传统方法的限制，特别是在处理复杂非线性系统时具有明显优势。

Abstract: Solving nonlinear algebraic equations is a fundamental but challenging
problem in scientific computations and also has many applications in system
engineering. Though traditional iterative methods and modern optimization
algorithms have exerted effective roles in addressing certain specific
problems, there still exist certain weaknesses such as the initial value
sensitivity, limited accuracy and slow convergence rate, particulary without
flexible input for the neural network methods. In this paper, we propose a
homotopy auxiliary neural network (HANN) for solving nonlinear algebraic
equations which integrates the classical homotopy continuation method and
popular physics-informed neural network. Consequently, the HANN-1 has strong
learning ability and can rapidly give an acceptable solution for the problem
which outperforms some known methods, while the HANN-2 can further improve its
accuracy. Numerical results on the benchmark problems confirm that the HANN
method can effectively solve the problems of determining the total number of
solutions of a single equation, finding solutions of transcendental systems
involving the absolute value function or trigonometric function,
ill-conditioned and normal high-dimensional nonlinear systems and time-varying
nonlinear problems, for which the Python's built-in Fsolve function exhibits
significant limitations, even fails to work.

Abstract: We investigate a finite element discretization of an elastic bending-plate
model with an effective prestrain. The model has been obtained via
homogenization and dimension reduction by B\"onlein at al. (2023). Its energy
functional is the $\Gamma$-limit of a three-dimensional nonlinear
microstructured elasticity functional. In the derived effective model, the
microstructure is incorporated as a local corrector problem, a system of linear
elliptic partial differential equations posed on a three-dimensional
representative volume element. The discretization uses Discrete Kirchhoff
Triangle elements for the macroscopic bending-plate problem on a mesh of scale
$H$, and first-order Lagrange elements for the microscopic corrector problem on
an axis-aligned mesh of scale $h$. We show that the discretized model
$\Gamma$-converges to the continuous one as $(h,H)\to 0$,provided that there
exists a microstructure mesh such that the elasticity tensor is Lipschitz
continuous on each mesh element. This extends earlier results by Rumpf et al.
(2024) to prestrained composites. Our argument does not require any rate of
convergence for the microscopic discretization error. As a corollary, we also
obtain convergence when $h \to 0$ and $H \to 0$ consecutively, and we prove
that these limit processes commute.

Motivation: 现有基于Krylov子空间的算法在大步长时精度会下降，需要一种更可靠的方法来计算指数积分器中的φ-函数线性组合。

Method: 结合缩放恢复方法和截断泰勒级数，通过最小化移位算子的基于幂的目标函数来选择谱位移和缩放参数，支持块变体实现同时评估多个函数。

Result: 在包括刚性和高度非正规矩阵的标准基准测试中，算法在小步长时达到接近机器精度（IEEE双精度），在大步长时保持可靠精度，而现有Krylov算法会恶化。

Conclusion: 该算法在可靠性和计算成本之间提供了有利的平衡，适用于指数积分器中φ-函数线性组合的高效计算。

Abstract: We propose a matrix-free algorithm for evaluating linear combinations of
$\varphi$-function actions, $w_i := \sum_{j=0}^{p}
\alpha_i^{\,j}\,\varphi_j(t_i A)v_j$ for $i=1\colon r$, arising in exponential
integrators. The method combines the scaling and recovering method with a
truncated Taylor series, choosing a spectral shift and a scaling parameter by
minimizing a power-based objective of the shifted operator. Accuracy is
user-controlled and ultimately limited by the working precision. The algorithm
decouples the stage abscissae $t_i$ from the polynomial weights $\alpha_i^j$,
and a block variant enables simultaneous evaluation of $\{w_i\}_{i=1}^r$.
Across standard benchmarks, including stiff and highly nonnormal matrices, the
algorithm attains near-machine accuracy (IEEE double precision in our tests)
for small step sizes and maintains reliable accuracy for larger steps where
several existing Krylov-based algorithms deteriorate, providing a favorable
balance of reliability and computational cost.

Conclusion: 二阶局部化Walsh函数成功结合了Walsh函数的近似能力和Haar小波的局部化特性，为处理边界无界的积分问题提供了有效工具，并在随机偏微分方程中展示了应用价值。

Abstract: We study numerical integration of functions $f: \mathbb{R}^{s} \to
\mathbb{R}$ with respect to a probability measure. By applying the
corresponding inverse cumulative distribution function, the problem is
transformed into integrating an induced function over the unit cube
$(0,1)^{s}$. We introduce a new orthonormal system: \emph{order~2 localized
Walsh functions}. These basis functions retain the approximation power of
classical Walsh functions for twice-differentiable integrands while inheriting
the spatial localization of Haar wavelets. Localization is crucial because the
transformed integrand is typically unbounded at the boundary. We show that the
worst-case quasi-Monte Carlo integration error decays like
$\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/\lambda})$ for every $\lambda \in (1/2,1]$. As an
application, we consider elliptic partial differential equations with a finite
number of log-normal random coefficients and show that our error estimates
remain valid for their stochastic Galerkin discretizations by applying a
suitable importance sampling density.

Motivation: 高压跨临界流体流动在现代能源和推进系统中至关重要，但在受限配置中，优化性能需要深入理解控制此类流动的耦合流体动力学和热力学非线性。低阶分解技术为量化非线性强迫如何驱动相干响应和放大关键流动结构提供了可解释框架。

Conclusion: 数据驱动分析揭示了在经典不可压缩壁面湍流中不存在的相干结构传播相速度。这些结构在伪沸腾区域附近增强并受限于热壁，与解析模式预测的近壁尺度运动高度一致。

Abstract: High-pressure transcritical fluid flows are central to modern energy and
propulsion systems. A key challenge lies in confined configurations, where
optimizing performance requires a deep understanding of the coupled
hydrodynamic and thermodynamic nonlinearities that govern such flows. In this
regard, low-order decomposition techniques offer an interpretable framework to
quantify how nonlinear forcings drive coherent responses and amplify key flow
structures. This work, thus, pursues two main objectives: establish a
resolvent-based framework tailored to high-pressure transcritical fluid flows,
and characterize the spatio-temporal sensitivity of the resolvent operator
using data-driven turbulent base flows. These analyses identify the flow
responses and forcings that optimally enhance mixing and heat transfer, along
with their characteristic scales. The results of the resolvent framework
reveals that amplification is dominated by streamwise-elongated structures with
spanwise periodicity, associated with peak singular values near spanwise
wavenumbers of order unity. Unlike ideal-gas or incompressible/isothermal
flows, the dominant forcings arise from thermodynamic fluctuations in the
pseudo-boiling region. Moreover, when the turbulent mean flow is used as input,
this results in intensified responses manifesting as coherent counter-rotating
vortex pairs. The energetic scale motions are constrained by the nature of the
low-Reynolds-number regime considered, with a single dominant spectral mode
reaching streamwise lengths comparable to those in the instantaneous fields.
Data-driven analyses further reveal coherent structures propagating at phase
speeds absent from classical incompressible wall-bounded turbulence. These
structures are intensified near the pseudo-boiling region and constrained
toward the hot wall, in strong agreement with resolvent-mode predictions of
near-wall scale motions.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of wall-bounded flows remains central to advancing both
theoretical understanding and computational methods in fluid mechanics. In this
study, we perform a numerical simulation of channel flow using a complementary
approach: a high-performance, differentiable finite-difference solver developed
in JAX (Finite-JAX) and an analytical solution derived from the Navier-Stokes
Equations, also referred to as the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. The solver is
applied to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, along with appropriate
boundary conditions, to capture canonical flow features such as velocity
profiles and pressure gradients. Cross-model verification is conducted by
systematically comparing numerical results between Finite-JAX and the
analytical solution, with a focus on velocity distributions. In addition,
numerical results are benchmarked against analytical solutions for laminar
regimes, allowing for the direct quantification of verification accuracy
errors. Our findings demonstrate that cross-model verification not only
strengthens confidence in simulation fidelity but also provides a pathway for
integrating differentiable solvers with established computational fluid
dynamics platforms, paving the way for future fluid flow research.

TL;DR: 在垂直亲水基底上使用激光雕刻的沟槽可以稳定连续的薄水膜，无需其他表面处理，为被动液体控制提供了简单可扩展的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稳定连续水膜对于热管理、被动集水和自清洁涂层等应用至关重要，但纯水的高表面张力使其难以稳定。现有方法依赖极端润湿性或精细图案化，成本高、易损坏且难以规模化。

Method: 在适度亲水的垂直基底上激光雕刻一对沟槽，通过横向锚定水来拉伸形成连续薄水膜。通过调节流速和沟槽几何形状来控制膜厚度。

Result: 稳定后的水膜可垂直延伸超过100个毛细长度（>30cm），膜厚度可通过流速和沟槽几何形状调节。在沟槽末端触发周期性不稳定性，包括膜破裂、回缩和液滴释放。膜厚度和回缩高度符合预测模型，液滴质量随间距和表面张力系统变化。

Conclusion: 这种基于沟槽的方法为创建、维持和控制薄水膜提供了简单可扩展的途径，为冷凝、表面清洁和二维毫流体系统中的被动液体控制开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Controlling water motion on surfaces is critical for applications ranging
from thermal management, passive water harvesting, to self-cleaning coatings.
Yet stabilising continuous water films, desirable for their high surface
coverage and drainage capacity, remains challenging with pure water, due to its
high surface tension. Existing strategies rely on extreme wettability achieved
by coating or fine-scale patterning, which are costly, fragile, or complex to
scale. A robust, purely geometric solution is still lacking. We demonstrate
that a pair of laser-engraved grooves on a moderately hydrophilic vertical
substrate can laterally anchor water and stretch a continuous thin film,
without any other surface treatment. Once stabilised, the film extends
vertically over 100 capillary lengths (> 30cm), with thickness tunable via both
flow rate and groove geometry. At the groove extremities, the end of anchoring
triggers a cyclic instability, characterised by film rupture, retraction, and
droplet release. The thickness of the film and retraction height obey
predictive models, while droplet mass varies systematically with spacing and
surface tension. This groove-based method offers a straightforward and scalable
approach to creating, sustaining, and controlling thin water films. It opens
new directions for passive liquid control in condensation, surface cleaning,
and 2D millifluidic systems.

Motivation: 从微流控到雾收集应用，小液滴在各种固体基底上传输，包括毛发、线、沟槽等轻质结构。研究液滴在垂直纤维上的滑动行为，因为这是一个复杂问题，液滴在下滑过程中会损失体积和速度。

Method: 使用原始实验装置实时跟踪液滴特性和动力学，研究单纤维和多纤维系统（考虑沟槽存在）。

Conclusion: 多个垂直纤维能够增强液滴速度，但同时会促进沟槽上的液体损失增加。

Abstract: From microfluidics to fog-harvesting applications, tiny droplets are
transported along various solid substrates including hairs, threads, grooves,
and other light structures. Driven by gravity, a droplet sliding along a
vertical fiber is a complex problem since it is losing volume and speed as it
goes down. With the help of an original setup, we solve this problem by
tracking in real-time droplet characteristics and dynamics. Single fibers as
well as multiple fiber systems are studied to consider the presence of grooves.
On both fibers and grooved threads, droplet speed and volume are seen to decay
rapidly because the liquid entity is leaving a thin film behind. This film
exerts a capillary force able to stop the droplet motion before it is
completely drained. A model is proposed to capture the droplet dynamics. We
evidence also that multiple vertical fibers are enhancing the droplet speed
while simultaneously promoting increased liquid loss on grooves.

Abstract: Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is the most widely used optical technique
for measuring two-dimensional velocity fields in fluids. However, with the
standard cross-correlation (CC) algorithm, improving the spatial resolution of
instantaneous velocity fields and obtaining dense velocity fields in real time
remains challenging. Optical Flow Velocimetry (OFV) offers a way to overcome
these limitations. In this study, we demonstrate that dense velocity fields
(one vector per pixel) with high spatial resolution can be obtained in real
time at frequencies up to thousands of Hertz using an optical flow approach. We
show that high resolution is achievable with optimized seeding, and that
computational speed can be increased by choosing appropriate parameters and
running on a single GPU. Using this method, 21 Mp velocity fields can be
computed in real-time at 90 Hz, while 4 Mp velocity fields can be computed up
to of 460 Hz. These measurements enable the computation of various flow
quantities in real time, during the experiment. It makes this technique
perfectly suitable for many new type of experiments, from closed-loop flow
control experiments based on OFV measurements, to very low frequency
measurements or monitoring of the flow to find rare events. They also greatly
accelerate post-processing leading to potential large time and energy gain for

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: 首次在Re_h=2100的背向台阶流动中实验检测到上游喷射爆发事件，使用长时程实时光学流场测速技术捕获了这一罕见极端事件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 湍流中的罕见极端事件对输运、混合和转捩至关重要，但实验捕获极其困难。

Method: 采用长时程实时光学流场测速技术(L-OFV)，连续监测1.5小时，通过数据驱动定义极端事件为速度探针深入分布尾部的罕见偏移。

Result: 检测到一个喷射状侵入再循环区域的事件，由合并的Kelvin-Helmholtz涡旋崩溃引发并由反向旋转涡旋维持，伴随重尾统计特性和脉动动能及涡量的同时放大。

Conclusion: 虽然只记录到单个事件凸显其罕见性，但结果确立了L-OFV作为分离剪切层中罕见事件检测的可行平台，并记录了背向台阶流动中先前未报道的上游喷射爆发机制。

Abstract: Rare and extreme events in turbulent flows play a critical role in transport,
mixing and transition, yet are notoriously difficumt to capture experimentally.
Here we report, to our knowledge, the first direct experimental detection of an
upstream-directed jet burst in a backward-facing step (BFS) flow at
$Re_h=2100$, using long-duration Live Optical Flow Velocimetry (L-OFV).
Continuous monitoring over 1.5 h enabled a data-driven definition of extremes
as rare velocity probes excursions deep into the observed distribution's tails;
in practice, large negatice events ($u: Z < -6$, $v: Z < -5$ at $(x,y) = (2h,h
/ 2)$, where $|Z| > > 0$ stands for large deviations form the mean value)
triggered the live capture of surrounding velocity fields. The recording is
triggered when the probes surpass the defined threshold, using live analysis of
the velocity fields. The detected event features a jet-like intrusino into the
recirculation region initiated by the collapse of a merged Kelvin-Helmholtz
vortex and sustained by counter-rotating vortices, and is accompanied with
heavy-tailed probe statistics and simultaneous amplufucation of fluctuating
kinetic energy and enstrophy. While a single event was recorded, underscoring
its rarity, the results establish L-OFV as aviable platform for rare-event
detection in separated shear layers and document a previously unreported
mechanism of upstream jet bursting in BFS flow.

TL;DR: WAN3DNS是一个基于弱形式的神经求解器，用于求解3D不可压缩Navier-Stokes方程，通过将方程重新表述为极小极大优化问题，直接从弱解中学习，克服了传统PINNs的严格可微性要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D不可压缩Navier-Stokes方程建模了湍流和空气动力学等关键流体现象，但由于非线性和解的正则性有限，求解困难。传统求解器成本高昂，而基于神经网络的方法通常假设强解，限制了在欠分辨区域的使用。

Method: 提出WAN3DNS方法，利用弱形式将方程重新表述为极小极大优化问题，直接从弱解中学习。该方法绕过了传统PINNs的严格可微性要求，适用于弱解存在但强解可能不存在的情况。

Result: 在三个基准案例（2D Kovasznay、3D Beltrami和3D lid-driven cavity flows）中评估了WAN3DNS的准确性和有效性。通过Galerkin理论进行严格的误差分析，表明L²训练误差可由网络架构参数和残差范数可控地界定。

Conclusion: 这项工作弥合了弱解理论与深度学习之间的差距，为具有降低正则性约束的复杂流体流动模拟提供了稳健的替代方案。

Abstract: The 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations model essential fluid
phenomena, including turbulence and aerodynamics, but are challenging to solve
due to nonlinearity and limited solution regularity. Despite extensive
research, the full mathematical understanding of the 3D incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations continues to elude scientists, highlighting the depth
and difficulty of the problem. Classical solvers are costly, and neural
network-based methods typically assume strong solutions, limiting their use in
underresolved regimes. We introduce WAN3DNS, a weak-form neural solver that
recasts the equations as a minimax optimization problem, allowing learning
directly from weak solutions. Using the weak formulation, WAN3DNS circumvents
the stringent differentiability requirements of classical physics-informed
neural networks (PINNs) and accommodates scenarios where weak solutions exist,
but strong solutions may not. We evaluated WAN3DNS's accuracy and effectiveness
in three benchmark cases: the 2D Kovasznay, 3D Beltrami, and 3D lid-driven
cavity flows. Furthermore, using Galerkin's theory, we conduct a rigorous error
analysis and show that the $L^{2}$ training error is controllably bounded by
the architectural parameters of the network and the norm of residues. This
implies that for neural networks with small loss, the corresponding $L^{2}$
error will also be small. This work bridges the gap between weak solution
theory and deep learning, offering a robust alternative for complex fluid flow
simulations with reduced regularity constraints. Code:

TL;DR: 该论文研究了稀聚合物溶液中压力驱动流动的弹性湍流，发现了局部化的'箭头'行波作为湍流的基本构建块，并分析了其对称性破缺和调制不稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了从理论上确认稀聚合物溶液中压力驱动流动的弹性湍流现象，该研究旨在识别和理解局部化箭头行波的形成机制及其在湍流中的作用。

Method: 通过追踪已知的展向不变箭头行波的对称性破缺分岔，发现展向周期性状态，然后揭示次级调制不稳定性导致展向局部化行波的形成。

Result: 发现了展向对称和非对称的局部化箭头行波，后者具有略微倾斜于流向的相速度。计算显示流动在局部和全局箭头状态之间随机切换，且观察到分裂事件。

Conclusion: 局部化箭头行波构成了弹性湍流的基本构建块，但由于跨剪切和展向速度较小，这种弹性湍流不是良好的混合器。

Abstract: Pressure-driven flow of a dilute polymer solution has been numerically
observed to possess a form of elastic turbulence which is organised around the
interactions of localised versions of 2-dimensional `arrowhead' travelling
waves (Page et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 154501, 2020). As a step to confirming
this theoretically, we identify spanwise-localised arrowhead travelling waves
by tracking a symmetry-breaking bifurcation of the known spanwise-invariant
(2D) arrowhead to a spanwise-periodic state and then discovering a secondary
modulational instability to a spanwise-localised travelling wave.
Spanwise-symmetric and asymmetric localised arrowheads exist with the latter
having a phase speed slightly inclined to the streamwise direction.
Computations capture the flow randomly switching between spanwise local and
global arrowhead states in a streamwise-restricted domain, suggesting they form
the building blocks of the chaos. Splitting events are also seen, in which a
single localised state spawns multiple arrowheads. However, both cross-shear
and spanwise velocities are small suggesting that this elastic turbulence will
not be a good mixer.

Result: 所提出的降阶模型在预测精度上表现出色，同时显著减少了计算资源和训练时间需求。

Conclusion: 该方法有潜力成为工业连续铸造操作中快速可靠的实时过程监测和优化工具。

Abstract: Continuous casting is a widely adopted process in the steel industry, where
maintaining high steel quality is paramount. Efficient prediction of grade
intermixing during ladle changeover operations is critical for maintaining
steel quality and minimizing material losses in the continuous casting process.
Among various factors influencing grade intermixing, operating parameters play
a significant role, in addition to tundish geometry and flow control devices.
In this study, three-dimensional, transient, two-phase turbulent flow
simulations are conducted to investigate the ladle changeover operation. During
this process, the molten steel level in the tundish typically varies over time,
significantly affecting the grade intermixing phenomena. The influence of ladle
change time on intermixing time has been presented. However, high-fidelity
full-order simulations of such complex transient phenomena are computationally
expensive and are impractical for real-time monitoring or design-space
exploration in industrial-scale applications. To address this issue, a reduced
order modelling approach based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and
reservoir computing (RC) is employed to efficiently predict intermixing time.
The proposed reduced order model (ROM) demonstrates excellent predictive
accuracy using limited training data while requiring significantly less
computational resources and training time. The results demonstrate the
potential of the proposed methodology as a fast, reliable tool for real-time
process monitoring and optimization in industrial continuous casting
operations.

Conclusion: 3D EBIT方法成功扩展了二维方法，保持了计算效率和精度，为三维多相流模拟提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The Edge-Based Interface Tracking (EBIT) method is a novel Front-Tracking
method where the markers are located on grid edges, and their connectivity is
implicitly represented by a color vertex field. This localized representation
simplifies the process of topology changes and allows for almost automatic
parallelization. In our previous journal articles, we have presented both the
kinematic part, includes the algorithms for advection of the interface and
color vertex field evolution, and the dynamic part, which couples the EBIT
method with the Navier--Stokes equations for multiphase flow simulations, in
the two-dimensional (2D) case.
  In this work, we propose a simplified strategy to extend the EBIT method to
three dimensions (3D). The directional split scheme used for interface
advection in 2D version is directly generalized to 3D. Specifically, the 3D
advection within a given cubic cell along one direction is decomposed into two
2D advection problems on the two cube faces. The dimension reduction allows us
to fully reused the 2D interface reconstruction algorithms, including the 2D
circle fit and the evolution rules for the color vertex field.
  For coupling with the Navier--Stokes equations, we first calculate volume
fractions from the position of the markers and the color vertex field using the
Front2VOF geometrical method, then viscosity and density fields from the
computed volume fractions, and finally surface tension stresses with the
Height-Function method. The 3D EBIT method has been implemented in the free
Basilisk platform and validated against five benchmark cases: translation with
uniform velocity, 3D deformation test, oscillating drop, rising bubble, and
bubble merging. The results are compared with those obtained using the
Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method already implemented in Basilisk.

Abstract: Metamaterials provide exceptional control over physical phenomena, enabling
many disruptive technologies. However, researches in hydrodynamic meta-devices
have mainly used intrusive methods to manipulate material structures, limited
by material properties and specific environmental conditions. Each design
serves a single function, reducing versatility. This study introduces a
meta-hydrodynamics theory using applied force fields to avoid physical contact
with the fluid and eliminate the need for inhomogeneous and anisotropic
metamaterials, allowing continuous switching between cloaking, shielding, and
Venturi amplification. The force field operates independently of the fluid's
physical properties, making it adaptable to various fluids and environmental
conditions. We derive volumetric force distributions for hydrodynamic devices
based on fluid properties and forces equivalence, using the integral median
theorem to homogenize these forces for practical applications. The
effectiveness of the proposed hydrodynamic devices is validated through
numerical simulations and quantitative analyses. By utilizing the
electromagnetic forces produced by the interaction between a conducting fluid
and an electromagnetic field, we experimentally verified the validity of our
theoretical simulations. Our research offers different insights into
hydrodynamic meta-devices design, enhancing practical applications and opening
avenues for innovative flow manipulation.

Abstract: This work identifies instabilities and computes the growth rate of a linear
time-varying system using the Lyapunov method. The linear system describes cold
fresh water on top of hot salty water with a periodically time-varying
background shear flow. We employ a time-dependent weighting matrix to construct
a Lyapunov function candidate, and the resulting linear matrix inequalities
formulation is discretized in time using the forward Euler method. As the
number of temporal discretization points increases, the growth rate predicted
from the Lyapunov method or the Floquet theory will converge to the same value
as that obtained from numerical simulations. We also use the Lyapunov method to
analyze the instantaneous principal direction of instabilities and compare the
computational resources required by the Lyapunov method, numerical simulations,
and the Floquet theory.
