Recent approaches rely on expensive Large Language Model (LLM) inference for both entity linking and path ranking, limiting their practical deployment. Additionally, LLM-generated answers often lack verifiable grounding in structured knowledge. We present two complementary hybrid algorithms that address both efficiency and verifiability: (1) LLM-Guided Planning that uses a single LLM call to predict relation sequences executed via breadth-first search, achieving near-perfect accuracy (micro-F1 > 0.90) while ensuring all answers are grounded in the knowledge graph, and (2) Embedding-Guided Neural Search that eliminates LLM calls entirely by fusing text and graph embeddings through a lightweight 6.7M-parameter edge scorer, achieving over 100 times speedup with competitive accuracy. Through knowledge distillation, we compress planning capability into a 4B-parameter model that matches large-model performance at zero API cost. Evaluation on MetaQA demonstrates that grounded reasoning consistently outperforms ungrounded generation, with structured planning proving more transferable than direct answer generation. Our results show that verifiable multi-hop reasoning does not require massive models at inference time, but rather the right architectural inductive biases combining symbolic structure with learned representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff1aLLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u89c4\u5212\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u6b21LLM\u8c03\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u5173\u7cfb\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e14\u7b54\u6848\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u5d4c\u5165\u5f15\u5bfc\u795e\u7ecf\u641c\u7d22\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u9664LLM\u8c03\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8fb9\u8bc4\u5206\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0100\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u7206\u70b8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u6602\u8d35LLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u7b54\u6848\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u3002", "method": "1) LLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u89c4\u5212\uff1a\u5355\u6b21LLM\u8c03\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u5173\u7cfb\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u5ea6\u4f18\u5148\u641c\u7d22\u6267\u884c\uff1b2) \u5d4c\u5165\u5f15\u5bfc\u795e\u7ecf\u641c\u7d22\uff1a\u878d\u5408\u6587\u672c\u548c\u56fe\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8fb9\u8bc4\u5206\u5668(6.7M\u53c2\u6570)\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5c06\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u538b\u7f29\u52304B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728MetaQA\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cLLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u89c4\u5212\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387(micro-F1 > 0.90)\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u5f15\u5bfc\u795e\u7ecf\u641c\u7d22\u5b9e\u73b0100\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c4\u5212\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u7b54\u6848\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u7b26\u53f7\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u793a\u7684\u9002\u5f53\u67b6\u6784\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u3002"}}

This study evaluates the faithfulness of LLM-generated explanations in the context of emotion classification in Persian, a low-resource language, by comparing the influential words identified by the model against those identified by human annotators. We assess faithfulness using confidence scores derived from token-level log-probabilities. Two prompting strategies, differing in the order of explanation and prediction (Predict-then-Explain and Explain-then-Predict), are tested for their impact on explanation faithfulness. Our results reveal that while LLMs achieve strong classification performance, their generated explanations often diverge from faithful reasoning, showing greater agreement with each other than with human judgments.

Furthermore, this physical quantity is a critical input for engineering applications. In this study, we propose a novel wake-added TKE prediction model capable of accurately predict the three-dimensional spatial distribution of wake-added TKE using only basic inflow and wind turbine operation conditions as inputs. The model consists of two sub-modules: one for calculating the azimuthally-averaged wake-added TKE and the other for determining the ground effect correction function. The calculation of the azimuthally-averaged wake-added TKE is based on the analytical solution derived from the corresponding wake-added TKE budget, while the ground effect correction function is determined using a unified functional form, owing to its self-similarity. To ensure the closure of these two sub-modules, we develop methods for determining all free parameters based on the large-eddy simulation (LES) cases. This results in an end-to-end prediction framework, enabling direct engineering applications of the proposed model. We compared the proposed model with LES calibration data and publicly available validation datasets from the literature, which include LES and wind tunnel experiments under various inflow and turbine operating conditions.

The massive amount of data generated; by the propensity of tourists to share comments and photos during their trip; makes it possible to model their journeys and analyze their behavior. Predicting the next movement of tourists plays a key role in tourism marketing to understand demand and improve decision support. In this paper, we propose a method to understand and to learn tourists' movements based on social network data analysis to predict future movements. The method relies on a machine learning grammatical inference algorithm. A major contribution in this paper is to adapt the grammatical inference algorithm to the context of big data.

Currently, there is a paucity of evidence-based integrated treatments for CP and OUD among individuals receiving medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Wearable devices have the potential to monitor complex patient information and inform treatment development for persons with OUD and CP, including pain variability (e.g., exacerbations of pain or pain spikes) and clinical correlates (e.g., perceived stress). However, the application of large language models (LLMs) with wearable data for understanding pain spikes, remains unexplored. Consequently, the aim of this pilot study was to examine the clinical correlates of pain spikes using a range of AI approaches. We found that machine learning models achieved relatively high accuracy (>0.7) in predicting pain spikes, while LLMs were limited in providing insights on pain spikes. Real-time monitoring through wearable devices, combined with advanced AI models, could facilitate early detection of pain spikes and support personalized interventions that may help mitigate the risk of opioid relapse, improve adherence to MOUD, and enhance the integration of CP and OUD care.

Such minimizers represent the most stable states of type-II superconductors and, for large material parameters $\u03ba$, capture the formation of lattices of quantized vortices. As the vortex cores shrink with increasing $\u03ba$, while their number grows, it is essential to understand how $\u03ba$ should couple to the mesh size in order to correctly resolve the vortex patterns in numerical simulations.

We observe that as the droplet is pulled away from the surface, the net vertical force varies in a typical sawtooth manner with peculiar peaks and troughs, characteristic of the surface. The force first reaches a maximum before the droplet detaches from the surface with a comparatively lower force. The force variation predicted by the numerical model is in good agreement with the experimental results of Kumar et al. [1]. We also studied the effect of evaporation on the variation in the adhesion force by simulating an evaporating droplet on a superhydrophobic surface. For an evaporating droplet, the numerically predicted maximum and detachment force magnitudes are in good agreement with those obtained experimentally when we take into account the change in the droplet weight as it evaporates.

Prior work relies on accuracy-based approaches, interpreting performance drops after removing a modality as indicative of its influence. However, such outcome-driven metrics fail to distinguish whether a modality is inherently informative or whether its value arises only through interaction with other modalities. This distinction is particularly important in cross-attention architectures, where modalities influence each other's representations. In this work, we propose a framework based on Partial Information Decomposition (PID) that quantifies modality contributions by decomposing predictive information in internal embeddings into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. To enable scalable, inference-only analysis, we develop an algorithm based on the Iterative Proportional Fitting Procedure (IPFP) that computes layer and dataset-level contributions without retraining.

Conventional evaluation methods, general reward functions or similarity-based metrics, fail to capture the diversity and complexity of personal visual tastes. In this work, we present PIGReward, a personalized reward model that dynamically generates user-conditioned evaluation dimensions and assesses images through CoT reasoning. To address the scarcity of user data, PIGReward adopt a self-bootstrapping strategy that reasons over limited reference data to construct rich user contexts, enabling personalization without user-specific training. Beyond evaluation, PIGReward provides personalized feedback that drives user-specific prompt optimization, improving alignment between generated images and individual intent.

While LLMs have thrived on abundant textual data, no comparable corpus exists for CUA trajectories. To address these gaps, we introduce FaraGen, a novel synthetic data generation system for multi-step web tasks. FaraGen can propose diverse tasks from frequently used websites, generate multiple solution attempts, and filter successful trajectories using multiple verifiers. It achieves high throughput, yield, and diversity for multi-step web tasks, producing verified trajectories at approximately $1 each. We use this data to train Fara-7B, a native CUA model that perceives the computer using only screenshots, executes actions via predicted coordinates, and is small enough to run on-device. We find that Fara-7B outperforms other CUA models of comparable size on benchmarks like WebVoyager, Online-Mind2Web, and WebTailBench -- our novel benchmark that better captures under-represented web tasks in pre-existing benchmarks. Furthermore, Fara-7B is competitive with much larger frontier models, illustrating key benefits of scalable data generation systems in advancing small efficient agentic models.

Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that forces on droplets receding over structured surfaces are governed by microscale deformations near the contact line. We present and experimentally validate an expression demonstrating that adhesion force increases logarithmically with pillar area fraction at constant droplet volume and pillar surface chemistry. Furthermore, we establish that the average tensile force measured in direct force measurements provides a more reliable indicator of surface structure than the commonly used maximum force.

Though the influence function was proposed for attributing how infinitesimal up-weighting or removal of individual training examples affects model outputs, its implementation is still challenging in deep-learning vision models: inverse-curvature computations are expensive, and training non-stationarity invalidates static approximations. Prior works use iterative solvers and low-rank surrogates to reduce cost, but offline computation lags behind training dynamics, and missing confidence calibration yields fragile rankings that misidentify critical examples. To address these challenges, we introduce a Stability-Guided Online Influence Framework (SG-OIF), the first framework that treats algorithmic stability as a real-time controller, which (i) maintains lightweight anchor IHVPs via stochastic Richardson and preconditioned Neumann; (ii) proposes modular curvature backends to modulate per-example influence scores using stability-guided residual thresholds, anomaly gating, and confidence. Experimental results show that SG-OIF achieves SOTA (State-Of-The-Art) on noise-label and out-of-distribution detection tasks across multiple datasets with various corruption.

We analyze preconditioned SGD in the geometry induced by a symmetric positive definite matrix $\\mathbf{M}$, deriving bounds in which both the convergence rate and the stochastic noise floor are governed by $\\mathbf{M}$-dependent quantities: the rate through an effective condition number in the $\\mathbf{M}$-metric, and the floor through the product of that condition number and the preconditioned noise level. For nonconvex objectives, we establish a preconditioner-dependent basin-stability guarantee: when smoothness and basin size are measured in the $\\mathbf{M}$-norm, the probability that the iterates remain in a well-behaved local region admits an explicit lower bound. This perspective is particularly relevant in Scientific Machine Learning (SciML), where achieving small training loss under stochastic updates is closely tied to physical fidelity, numerical stability, and constraint satisfaction. The framework applies to both diagonal/adaptive and curvature-aware preconditioners and yields a simple design principle: choose $\\mathbf{M}$ to improve local conditioning while attenuating noise.

While many of the sentiment analysis systems are developed for English, many African languages are classified as low-resource languages due to the lack of digital language resources like text labelled with corresponding sentiment classes. One reason for that is that manually labelling text data is time-consuming and expensive. Consequently, automatic and rapid processes are needed to reduce the manual effort as much as possible making the labelling process as efficient as possible. In this paper, we present and analyze an automatic language-independent sentiment labelling method that leverages information from sentiment-bearing emojis and words. Our experiments are conducted with tweets in the languages English, Sepedi and Setswana from SAfriSenti, a multilingual sentiment corpus for South African languages. We show that our sentiment labelling approach is able to label the English tweets with an accuracy of 66%, the Sepedi tweets with 69%, and the Setswana tweets with 63%, so that on average only 34% of the automatically generated labels remain to be corrected.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u8868\u60c5\u7b26\u53f7\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u8bcd\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u52a8\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u65e0\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u82f1\u8bed\u3001Sepedi\u548cSetswana\u4e09\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e8666%\u300169%\u548c63%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u975e\u6d32\u8bed\u8a00\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u6602\u8d35\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u60c5\u7b26\u53f7\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u8bcd\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u8a00\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5728SAfriSenti\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u60c5\u611f\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u82f1\u8bed\u63a8\u6587\u6807\u6ce8\u51c6\u786e\u738766%\uff0cSepedi\u63a8\u658769%\uff0cSetswana\u63a8\u658763%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u53ea\u9700\u4fee\u6b6334%\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This study systematically develops a data fusion framework to address this issue.

The second phase demonstrates that enriching the training with both CFD and experimental data significantly enhances predictive accuracy: errors in pressure and density are reduced to 12.6% and 7.4%, respectively. This model also captures key flow features such as separation and reattachment shocks more distinctly. Physical analyses based on this improved model, including investigations into ramp angle effects and global stability analysis, confirm its utility for efficient design applications. In the third phase, a pre-trained model (using only CFD data) is successfully fine-tuned with experimental schlieren images, effectively reconstructing velocity fields and validating the transferability of the approach.

In this paper, we introduce Pistachio, a new VAD/VAU benchmark constructed entirely through a controlled, generation-based pipeline. By leveraging recent advances in video generation models, Pistachio provides precise control over scenes, anomaly types, and temporal narratives, effectively eliminating the biases and limitations of Internet-collected datasets. Our pipeline integrates scene-conditioned anomaly assignment, multi-step storyline generation, and a temporally consistent long-form synthesis strategy that produces coherent 41-second videos with minimal human intervention. Extensive experiments demonstrate the scale, diversity, and complexity of Pistachio, revealing new challenges for existing methods and motivating future research on dynamic and multi-event anomaly understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "Pistachio\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u5728\u573a\u666f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u5f02\u5e38\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u573a\u666f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u7406\u89e3\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6df1\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u573a\u666f\u6761\u4ef6\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u914d\u3001\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u6545\u4e8b\u60c5\u8282\u751f\u6210\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u957f\u683c\u5f0f\u5408\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6784\u5efa41\u79d2\u7684\u8fde\u8d2f\u89c6\u9891\u3002", "result": "Pistachio\u57fa\u51c6\u5728\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u65b0\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u591a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5f02\u5e38\u7406\u89e3\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u52a8\u529b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u590d\u6742\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Using FISCAL, we generate a dataset called FISCAL-data and use it to train MiniCheck-FISCAL, a lightweight verifier for numerical financial claims. MiniCheck-FISCAL outperforms its baseline, surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo and other open-source peers of similar size, and approaches the accuracy of much larger systems (20x), such as Mixtral-8x22B and Command R+. On external datasets FinDVer and Fin-Fact, it rivals GPT-4o and Claude-3.5 while outperforming Gemini-1.5 Flash. These results show that domain-specific synthetic data, combined with efficient fine-tuning, enables compact models to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, robustness, and scalability for practical financial AI.

To address this limitation, we propose PersonaPulse: Dynamic Profile Optimization for Realistic Personality Expression in LLMs, a framework that leverages LLMs' inherent knowledge of personality traits to iteratively enhance role-play prompts while integrating a situational response benchmark as a scoring tool, ensuring a more realistic and contextually grounded evaluation to guide the optimization process. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the prompts generated by PersonaPulse outperform those of prior work, which were designed based on personality descriptions from psychological studies. Additionally, we explore the relationship between model size and personality modeling through extensive experiments. Finally, we find that, for certain personality traits, the extent of personality evocation can be partially controlled by pausing the optimization process.

In two-dimensions, as a consequence of four-color theorem in mathematics, there is a change in topological constraints for $N = 3$ and $N \\ge 4$ components. This leads to a suppression of hydrodynamics effects and we show that the diffusion-dominated coarsening dynamics for $N \\ge 4$ can be collapsed to a single master curve. The behavior extends to thin three-dimensional systems as the fluid domain size reaches the smallest system dimension. However, by varying the fluid interfacial tensions, cloaking may occur, resulting in highly complex coarsening dynamics that can differ for each component. In full three-dimensional cases, the absence of four-color theorem (or its equivalent) means that the diffusive scaling law is only reached asymptotically for large $N$ rather than at a certain critical $N$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86N>2\u79cd\u4e0d\u6df7\u6eb6\u6d41\u4f53\u7ec4\u5206\u7684\u76f8\u5206\u79bb\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u6570\u5b66\u4e0a\u7684\u56db\u8272\u5b9a\u7406\uff0cN=3\u548cN\u22654\u65f6\u62d3\u6251\u7ea6\u675f\u53d1\u751f\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6548\u5e94\u88ab\u6291\u5236\uff0cN\u22654\u7684\u6269\u6563\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7c97\u5316\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53ef\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u4e3b\u66f2\u7ebf\u3002\u8be5\u884c\u4e3a\u5ef6\u4f38\u5230\u4e09\u7ef4\u8584\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u6539\u53d8\u754c\u9762\u5f20\u529b\u65f6\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u5305\u8986\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7c97\u5316\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002\u5728\u5b8c\u6574\u4e09\u7ef4\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u56db\u8272\u5b9a\u7406\u7b49\u6548\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u6269\u6563\u6807\u5ea6\u5f8b\u4ec5\u5728\u5927N\u65f6\u6e10\u8fd1\u8fbe\u5230\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u7ec4\u5206\uff08N>2\uff09\u4e0d\u6df7\u6eb6\u6d41\u4f53\u76f8\u5206\u79bb\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7ea6\u675f\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u56db\u8272\u5b9a\u7406\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f71\u54cd\u5728\u4e09\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e8c\u7ef4\u548c\u4e09\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2dN\u79cd\u4e0d\u6df7\u6eb6\u6d41\u4f53\u7ec4\u5206\u7684\u76f8\u5206\u79bb\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u62d3\u6251\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u56db\u8272\u5b9a\u7406\uff09\u5bf9\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u6269\u6563\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7c97\u5316\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2dN\u22654\u65f6\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6548\u5e94\u88ab\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u6269\u6563\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7c97\u5316\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53ef\u7edf\u4e00\u63cf\u8ff0\uff1b\u4e09\u7ef4\u8584\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u884c\u4e3a\u7c7b\u4f3c\uff0c\u4f46\u754c\u9762\u5f20\u529b\u53d8\u5316\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5305\u8986\u73b0\u8c61\uff1b\u5b8c\u6574\u4e09\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6269\u6563\u6807\u5ea6\u5f8b\u4ec5\u5728\u5927N\u65f6\u6e10\u8fd1\u8fbe\u5230\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56db\u8272\u5b9a\u7406\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u591a\u7ec4\u5206\u6d41\u4f53\u76f8\u5206\u79bb\u4e2d\u8d77\u5230\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4N\u22654\u65f6\u62d3\u6251\u7ea6\u675f\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6548\u5e94\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u4e09\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5927N\u624d\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6807\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

However, their modular structure introduces a unique vulnerability: adversaries can attempt to compress or repurpose models by pruning experts and cheaply fine-tuning the remainder, effectively bypassing licensing and security constraints. In this paper, we systematically study the prunability of MoE-LLMs under task-specific usage. We first develop an expert attribution framework that identifies the subset of experts most responsible for a given task, then evaluate the performance trade-offs of pruning and re-aligning these experts using active learning-driven fine-tuning. Our findings reveal a critical knowledge loss--recovery trade-off: while certain experts can be isolated to retain task accuracy, significant degradation occurs without targeted re-alignment. Based on this analysis, we propose defense strategies that aim to make MoE models harder to compress and fine-tune without authorization, including entangled expert training and selective fine-tuning protocols that resist unauthorized adaptation. By positioning expert pruning as both a threat vector and a defense target, this work highlights the dual-use nature of MoE modularity and provides the first systematic evaluation framework for secure specialization of MoE-LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86MoE-LLMs\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u4fee\u526a\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u635f\u5931-\u6062\u590d\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "MoE\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7279\u6027\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff1a\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u526a\u4e13\u5bb6\u5e76\u5ec9\u4ef7\u5fae\u8c03\u5269\u4f59\u90e8\u5206\u6765\u7ed5\u8fc7\u8bb8\u53ef\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u6216\u91cd\u65b0\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e13\u5bb6\u5f52\u56e0\u6846\u67b6\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u4e13\u5bb6\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4fee\u526a\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u635f\u5931-\u6062\u590d\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u867d\u7136\u53ef\u4ee5\u9694\u79bb\u67d0\u4e9b\u4e13\u5bb6\u6765\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u679c\u6ca1\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e13\u5bb6\u4fee\u526a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e3a\u5a01\u80c1\u5411\u91cf\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86MoE\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u7528\u9014\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3aMoE-LLMs\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Despite their shared objective, existing approaches often tackle these tasks using specialized architectures or modality-specific parameters, limiting their generalization and scalability. Recent efforts have attempted to unify multiple tracking and segmentation subtasks from the perspectives of any modality input or multi-task inference. However, these approaches tend to overlook two critical challenges: the distributional gap across different modalities and the feature representation gap across tasks. These issues hinder effective cross-task and cross-modal knowledge sharing, ultimately constraining the development of a true generalist model. To address these limitations, we propose a universal tracking and segmentation framework named SATA, which unifies a broad spectrum of tracking and segmentation subtasks with any modality input. Specifically, a Decoupled Mixture-of-Expert (DeMoE) mechanism is presented to decouple the unified representation learning task into the modeling process of cross-modal shared knowledge and specific information, thus enabling the model to maintain flexibility while enhancing generalization. Additionally, we introduce a Task-aware Multi-object Tracking (TaMOT) pipeline to unify all the task outputs as a unified set of instances with calibrated ID information, thereby alleviating the degradation of task-specific knowledge during multi-task training.

Traditional human alignment reviews are accurate but slow and labor-intensive, especially across large item banks. This study examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can accelerate this process without sacrificing accuracy. Using over 12,000 item-skill pairs in grades K-5, we tested three LLMs (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o) across three tasks that mirror real-world challenges: identifying misaligned items, selecting the correct skill from the full set of standards, and narrowing candidate lists prior to classification. In Study 1, GPT-4o-mini correctly identified alignment status in approximately 83-94% of cases, including subtle misalignments. In Study 2, performance remained strong in mathematics but was lower for reading, where standards are more semantically overlapping. Study 3 demonstrated that pre-filtering candidate skills substantially improved results, with the correct skill appearing among the top five suggestions more than 95% of the time. These findings suggest that LLMs, particularly when paired with candidate filtering strategies, can significantly reduce the manual burden of item review while preserving alignment accuracy.

Large language models (LLMs) may help detect and correct such errors, but their behavior under different prompting strategies remains unclear. We evaluate zero-shot prompting, static prompting with random exemplars (SPR), and retrieval-augmented dynamic prompting (RDP) for three subtasks of medical error processing: error flag detection, error sentence detection, and error correction.\n  Methods: Using the MEDEC dataset, we evaluated nine instruction-tuned LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini, and OpenAI o-series models). We measured performance using accuracy, recall, false-positive rate (FPR), and an aggregate score of ROUGE-1, BLEURT, and BERTScore for error correction. We also analyzed example outputs to identify failure modes and differences between LLM and clinician reasoning.\n  Results: Zero-shot prompting showed low recall in both detection tasks, often missing abbreviation-heavy or atypical errors. SPR improved recall but increased FPR. Across all nine LLMs, RDP reduced FPR by about 15 percent, improved recall by 5 to 10 percent in error sentence detection, and generated more contextually accurate corrections.\n  Conclusion: Across diverse LLMs, RDP outperforms zero-shot and SPR prompting.

The pressure drop is given between the channel inlet and outlet. At the initial moment of time, the channel walls are contaminated with adhered particles, i.e. the walls are uneven, which affects the formation of the flow structure through the channel. Over time, under the action of viscous stresses and thermal noise, the particles break away from the channel walls, causing its cleaning. The interaction of the detached particles with the flow is taken into account in the Stokes approximation. In addition, the model takes into account random particle motion caused by diffusion. The problem is solved numerically within the framework of the random walk model. The evolution of the liquid flow in the channel during its cleaning is obtained: stream function, pressure, and vorticity fields. The dependencies of the volume occupied by settled particles, the flow rate through the channel and the channel gap on time are determined for different values of the interaction force between particles and channel wall. The estimations of the channel cleaning time are obtained and discussed. The possibility of control the cleaning process by the modulation of liquid flux through the channel is investigated.

However, the performance of the system is highly dependent on the quality of the retrieval module. If the retrieval results have low relevance to user needs or contain noisy information, it will directly lead to distortion of the generated content. In response to the performance bottleneck of existing models in processing tabular features, this paper proposes an XGBoost machine learning regression model based on feature engineering and particle swarm optimization. Correlation analysis shows that answer_quality is positively correlated with doc_delevance by 0.66, indicating that document relevance has a significant positive effect on answer quality, and improving document relevance may enhance answer quality; The strong negative correlations between semantic similarity, redundancy, and diversity were -0.89 and -0.88, respectively, indicating a tradeoff between semantic similarity, redundancy, and diversity. In other words, as the former two increased, diversity significantly decreased. The experimental results comparing decision trees, AdaBoost, etc. show that the VMD PSO BiLSTM model is superior in all evaluation indicators, with significantly lower MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE compared to the comparison model. The R2 value is higher, indicating that its prediction accuracy, stability, and data interpretation ability are more outstanding.

The relative orientation of a 3D reference object can be determined from a 3D rotated version of that object, or from a projection of the rotated object to a 2D planar image. This projection can be a perspective projection (the PnP problem) or an orthographic projection (the OnP problem). We restrict our attention here to the OnP problem and the full 3D pose estimation task (the EnP problem). Here we solve the least squares systems for both the error-free EnP and OnP problems in terms of the determinant ratio matrix (DRaM) approach. The noisy-data case can be addressed with a straightforward rotation correction scheme. While the SVD and optimal quaternion eigensystem methods solve the noisy EnP 3D-3D alignment exactly, the noisy 3D-2D orthographic (OnP) task has no known comparable closed form, and can be solved by DRaM-class methods. We note that while previous similar work has been presented in the literature exploiting both the QR decomposition and the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse transformations, here we place these methods in a larger context that has not previously been fully recognized in the absence of the corresponding DRaM solution. We term this class of solutions as the DRaM family, and conduct comparisons of the behavior of the families of solutions for the EnP and OnP rotation estimation problems. Overall, this work presents both a new solution to the 3D and 2D orthographic pose estimation problems and provides valuable insight into these classes of problems. With hindsight, we are able to show that our DRaM solutions to the exact EnP and OnP problems possess derivations that could have been discovered in the time of Gauss, and in fact generalize to all analogous N-dimensional Euclidean pose estimation problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u6bd4\u503c\u77e9\u9635(DRaM)\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b33D-3D(EnP)\u548c3D-2D\u6b63\u4ea4\u6295\u5f71(OnP)\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7edf\u4e00\u5230DRaM\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u3002", "motivation": "\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684PnP\u548cOnP\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4e3aEnP\u548cOnP\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u5c01\u95ed\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f6e\u4e8e\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684DRaM\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u6bd4\u503c\u77e9\u9635(DRaM)\u65b9\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3EnP\u548cOnP\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u7528\u65cb\u8f6c\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u5c06QR\u5206\u89e3\u548cMoore-Penrose\u4f2a\u9006\u53d8\u6362\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u7edf\u4e00\u5230DRaM\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86EnP\u548cOnP\u95ee\u9898\u7684DRaM\u89e3\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89e3\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u6240\u6709N\u7ef4\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e0eSVD\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u56db\u5143\u6570\u7279\u5f81\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cDRaM\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3aOnP\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5c01\u95ed\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e3a3D\u548c2D\u6b63\u4ea4\u6295\u5f71\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89e3\uff0c\u8fd8\u6df1\u5165\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eDRaM\u89e3\u5177\u6709\u5386\u53f2\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002"}}

We introduce VISTA-Gym, a scalable training environment for incentivizing tool-integrated visual reasoning capabilities in VLMs. VISTA-Gym unifies diverse real-world multimodal reasoning tasks (7 tasks from 13 datasets in total) with a standardized interface for visual tools (e.g., grounding, parsing), executable interaction loops, verifiable feedback signals, and efficient trajectory logging, enabling visual agentic reinforcement learning at scale. While recent VLMs exhibit strong text-only reasoning, both proprietary and open-source models still struggle with tool selection, invocation, and coordination. With VISTA-Gym, we train VISTA-R1 to interleave tool-use with agentic reasoning via multi-turn trajectory sampling and end-to-end reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments across 11 public reasoning-intensive VQA benchmarks show that VISTA-R1-8B outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with similar sizes by 9.51%-18.72%, demonstrating VISTA-Gym as an effective training ground to unlock the tool-integrated reasoning capabilities for VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "VISTA-Gym\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u5de5\u5177\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee3\u7406\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u89c6\u89c9\u4ea4\u4e92\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u5347\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1VISTA-Gym\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u7edf\u4e007\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a113\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u5de5\u5177\u63a5\u53e3\u3001\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5faa\u73af\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53cd\u9988\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8f6e\u8f68\u8ff9\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3VISTA-R1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u572811\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u578bVQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cVISTA-R1-8B\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53479.51%-18.72%\u3002", "conclusion": "VISTA-Gym\u662f\u89e3\u9501\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This paper introduces a scalable, robust, and efficient algorithm to deal with 2D and 3D elastostatics contact problems between deformable bodies in a finite element framework. The proposed solution combines a treatment of the contact problem by a node-to-node pairing algorithm with a penalization technique and a non-conforming h-adaptive refinement of quadrilateral/hexahedral meshes based on an estimate-mark-refine approach in a parallel framework. One of the special features of our parallel strategy is that contact paired nodes are hosted by the same MPI tasks, which reduces the number of exchanges between processes for building the contact operator. The mesh partitioning introduced in this paper respects this rule and is based on an equidistribution of elements over processes, without any other constraints. In order to preserve the domain curvature while hierarchical mesh refinement, super-parametric elements are used. This functionality enables the contact zone to be well detected during the AMR process, even for an initial coarse mesh and low-order discretization schemes. The efficiency of our contact-AMR-HPC strategy is assessed on 2D and 3D Hertzian contact problems. Different AMR detection criteria are considered. Various convergence analyses are conducted. Parallel performances up to 1024 cores are illustrated. Furthermore, memory footprint and preconditionners performance are analyzed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5e76\u884c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f51\u683c\u7ec6\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b32D\u548c3D\u5f39\u6027\u63a5\u89e6\u529b\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8282\u70b9\u914d\u5bf9\u63a5\u89e6\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u60e9\u7f5a\u6280\u672f\u548c\u975e\u534f\u8c03h\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ec6\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u5e76\u884c\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e76\u884c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u503c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f51\u683c\u7ec6\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b33D\u5f39\u6027\u9759\u529b\u5b66\u63a5\u89e6\u95ee\u9898\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7a81\u7834\u5f53\u524d\u6027\u80fd\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u8282\u70b9\u914d\u5bf9\u63a5\u89e6\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u60e9\u7f5a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1-\u6807\u8bb0-\u7ec6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u975e\u534f\u8c03h\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u56db\u8fb9\u5f62/\u516d\u9762\u4f53\u7f51\u683c\u7ec6\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u5e76\u884c\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u5173\u952e\u7279\u6027\u662f\u63a5\u89e6\u914d\u5bf9\u8282\u70b9\u7531\u76f8\u540cMPI\u4efb\u52a1\u6258\u7ba1\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8fdb\u7a0b\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "result": "\u57282D\u548c3D\u8d6b\u5179\u63a5\u89e6\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u63a5\u89e6-AMR-HPC\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7684AMR\u68c0\u6d4b\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u6536\u655b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u57281024\u6838\u4e0a\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u548c\u9884\u5904\u7406\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f51\u683c\u7ec6\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u7c97\u7f51\u683c\u548c\u4f4e\u9636\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u4e0b\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u63a5\u89e6\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u5f39\u6027\u63a5\u89e6\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u3002"}}

For CUAs to operate effectively, application selection, which refers to deciding which application to use before invoking fine-grained tools such as APIs, is a fundamental capability. It determines whether the agent initializes the correct environment, avoids orchestration confusion, and efficiently focuses on relevant context. However, existing benchmarks primarily assess fine-grained API selection, offering limited insight into whether models can reason across and choose between different applications. To fill this gap, we introduce AppSelectBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating application selection in CUAs. AppSelectBench contains a novel user task generation pipeline that produces realistic, diverse, and semantically grounded user intents at scale, together with unified evaluation protocols covering random, heuristic, zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented-settings. AppSelectBench covers one hundred widely used desktop applications and includes more than one hundred thousand realistic, diverse, and semantically grounded user tasks. Extensive experiments across both closed-source and open-source large language models reveal systematic strengths and weaknesses in inter-application reasoning, showing that even the most capable models still struggle to make consistent application choices. Together, these results establish AppSelectBench as a foundation for studying and advancing application level reasoning, an essential yet underexplored capability of intelligent CUAs.

They are commonly measured by the sessile drop technique, also called goniometry, which doses liquid through a solid needle. Consequently, this method requires substantial drop volumes, long contact times, tends to be user-dependent, and is difficult to automate. Here, we propose the stood-up drop (SUD) technique as an alternative to measure receding contact angles. The method consists of depositing a liquid drop on a surface by a short liquid jet, at which it spreads radially forming a pancake-shaped film. Then the liquid retracts, forming a spherical cap drop shape (stood-up drop). At this quasi-equilibrium state, the contact angle ($\u03b8_\\text{SUD}$) closely resembles the receding contact angle measured by goniometry.

However, vital signs are often noisy and exhibit rapid fluctuations, while laboratory tests suffer from missing values, measurement lags, and device-specific bias, making integrative forecasting highly challenging. To address these issues, we propose OmniTFT, a deep learning framework that jointly learns and forecasts high-frequency vital signs and sparsely sampled laboratory results based on the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT). Specifically, OmniTFT implements four novel strategies to enhance performance: sliding window equalized sampling to balance physiological states, frequency-aware embedding shrinkage to stabilize rare-class representations, hierarchical variable selection to guide model attention toward informative feature clusters, and influence-aligned attention calibration to enhance robustness during abrupt physiological changes. By reducing the reliance on target-specific architectures and extensive feature engineering, OmniTFT enables unified modeling of multiple heterogeneous clinical targets while preserving cross-institutional generalizability. Across forecasting tasks, OmniTFT achieves substantial performance improvement for both vital signs and laboratory results on the MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, and eICU datasets. Its attention patterns are interpretable and consistent with known pathophysiology, underscoring its potential utility for quantitative decision support in clinical care.", "AI": {"tldr": "OmniTFT\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eTemporal Fusion Transformer\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8054\u5408\u9884\u6d4bICU\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u751f\u547d\u4f53\u5f81\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "ICU\u4e2d\u7684\u751f\u547d\u4f53\u5f81\u6570\u636e\u901a\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u7ed3\u679c\u5219\u9762\u4e34\u7f3a\u5931\u503c\u3001\u6d4b\u91cf\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u7efc\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u6781\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f02\u6784\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eTemporal Fusion Transformer\u6784\u5efaOmniTFT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u56db\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u5747\u8861\u91c7\u6837\u5e73\u8861\u751f\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u5d4c\u5165\u6536\u7f29\u7a33\u5b9a\u7f55\u89c1\u7c7b\u522b\u8868\u793a\u3001\u5206\u5c42\u53d8\u91cf\u9009\u62e9\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u6ce8\u4fe1\u606f\u7279\u5f81\u7c07\u3001\u5f71\u54cd\u5bf9\u9f50\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6821\u51c6\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u7406\u7a81\u53d8\u65f6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728MIMIC-III\u3001MIMIC-IV\u548ceICU\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cOmniTFT\u5bf9\u751f\u547d\u4f53\u5f81\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u7ed3\u679c\u90fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5176\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u4e0e\u5df2\u77e5\u75c5\u7406\u751f\u7406\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "OmniTFT\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u5927\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u4e2a\u5f02\u6784\u4e34\u5e8a\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8de8\u673a\u6784\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u62a4\u7406\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5b9a\u91cf\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

The key to our approach is a pre-trained variational autoencoder that maps 3D geometries to latent features, which greatly reducing the difficulty of 3D generation. Starting from latent features, the pipeline of LatentDreamer generates coarse geometries, refined geometries, and realistic textures sequentially. The 3D objects generated by LatentDreamer exhibit high fidelity to the input images, and the entire generation process can be completed within a short time (typically in 70 seconds).

The coupling preserves the energy conserving structure of the low order dynamics solver, while the high order material transport scheme is provably tracer variance conserving, or damping with the inclusion of upwinding. The two methods are coupled via the multigrid hierarchy of the low order dynamics solver, with the basis functions of the high order transport being collocated at the Gauss-Legendre quadrature points with the low order dynamics on the finest scale multigrid mesh.\n  Standard test cases are presented to verify the consistency and conservation properties of the method.

However, generalist models miss domain-specific nuances in high-stakes fields like finance and law, and naive fine-tuning causes surface-form overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. To address this challenge, we introduce R2R, a domain-aware framework that combines dynamic expert routing with a two-stage training strategy, Entity Abstraction for Generalization (EAG). EAG introduces a counter-shortcut mechanism by masking the most predictive surface cues, forcing the reranker to learn domain-invariant relevance patterns rather than memorizing dataset-specific entities. To efficiently activate domain experts, R2R employs a lightweight Latent Semantic Router that probes internal representations from the frozen backbone decoder to select the optimal LoRA expert per query. Extensive experiments across different reranker backbones and diverse domains (legal, medical, and financial) demonstrate that R2R consistently surpasses generalist and single-domain fine-tuned baselines.

Picardo"], "title": "Morphology of mucus films in lung airways: secretion and ciliary evacuation", "comment": "10 pages, 4 figures", "summary": "Lung airways are lined by a film of mucus which protects the epithelium from inhaled particles. To maintain a uniform coating, the mucus that is secreted into airways must be distributed into a film by wall-attached cilia, which constantly convey mucus along the airway. However, the film's natural tendency is to accumulate into humps and plugs, due to the Rayleigh-Plateau instability. To understand the behaviour of the film amidst these competing factors, we perform simulations of an idealized tubular airway using a reduced-order thin-film model. The axial boundaries are nonperiodic, allowing for cilia-driven inflow and outflow; a tangential velocity along the tubular wall models ciliary transport, while a localized source at the wall accounts for secretion. On increasing the mucus input rate, we find three distinct film morphologies: (i) uniform flat films; (ii) nonuniform films that are composed of travelling unduloid-shaped humps, separated by mucus-depleted zones; and (iii) films that form an occluding plug. The flat-film regime, absent in closed periodic domains, emerges as a consequence of the convective nature of the Rayleigh-Plateau instability in the presence of ciliary transport. Higher secretion rates increase the mean film-thickness and induce a convective-to-absolute transition, which manifests in the appearance of travelling humps. In the plug-forming regime, capillary forces dominate and drive the incoming mucus into a single hump, which resists ciliary translation and remains near the mucus source. Our results show how low-level baseline secretion sustains a protective, uniform mucus film, and how hypersecretion -- stimulated, for example, by inhaled allergens -- produces mucus plugs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u8584\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u6c14\u9053\u4e2d\u9ecf\u6db2\u819c\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9ecf\u6db2\u5206\u6ccc\u901f\u7387\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e09\u79cd\u5f62\u6001\uff1a\u5747\u5300\u8584\u819c\u3001\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u9686\u8d77\u548c\u963b\u585e\u6027\u9ecf\u6db2\u6813\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9ecf\u6db2\u5206\u6ccc\u4e0e\u6c14\u9053\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u6c14\u9053\u9ecf\u6db2\u819c\u5728\u7ea4\u6bdb\u8fd0\u8f93\u548c\u745e\u5229-\u666e\u62c9\u6258\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7ade\u4e89\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u6b63\u5e38\u5206\u6ccc\u5982\u4f55\u7ef4\u6301\u4fdd\u62a4\u6027\u8584\u819c\uff0c\u800c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5206\u6ccc\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ecf\u6db2\u6813\u5f62\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u8584\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u7ba1\u72b6\u6c14\u9053\uff0c\u975e\u5468\u671f\u6027\u8f74\u5411\u8fb9\u754c\u5141\u8bb8\u7ea4\u6bdb\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6d41\u5165\u6d41\u51fa\uff0c\u7ba1\u58c1\u5207\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u6a21\u62df\u7ea4\u6bdb\u8fd0\u8f93\uff0c\u5c40\u90e8\u6e90\u6a21\u62df\u9ecf\u6db2\u5206\u6ccc\u3002", "result": "\u968f\u7740\u9ecf\u6db2\u8f93\u5165\u901f\u7387\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u819c\u5f62\u6001\uff1a\u5747\u5300\u5e73\u5766\u819c\u3001\u7531\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u7c7b\u6ce2\u72b6\u9686\u8d77\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u975e\u5747\u5300\u819c\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f62\u6210\u963b\u585e\u6027\u6813\u7684\u819c\u3002\u5e73\u5766\u819c\u72b6\u6001\u5728\u5c01\u95ed\u5468\u671f\u6027\u57df\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u662f\u7ea4\u6bdb\u8fd0\u8f93\u4e0b\u745e\u5229-\u666e\u62c9\u6258\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u6d41\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f4e\u6c34\u5e73\u57fa\u7840\u5206\u6ccc\u7ef4\u6301\u4fdd\u62a4\u6027\u5747\u5300\u9ecf\u6db2\u819c\uff0c\u800c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5206\u6ccc\uff08\u5982\u5438\u5165\u8fc7\u654f\u539f\u523a\u6fc0\uff09\u4ea7\u751f\u9ecf\u6db2\u6813\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9ecf\u6db2\u5206\u6ccc\u901f\u7387\u5728\u6c14\u9053\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Two primary approaches can be applied to improve the performance of LLMs: fine-tuning, which aligns LLM predictions more closely with human responses, and rectification, which corrects biases in LLM outputs. In this paper, we develop a framework that combines fine-tuning and rectification, and optimally allocates limited labeled samples across the two stages. Unlike the conventional objective that minimizes the mean squared prediction errors, we propose to minimize the variance of the prediction errors as the fine-tuning objective, which is optimal for the downstream rectification stage. Building on this insight, we leverage empirical scaling laws to develop a data-driven method for optimally splitting samples between the fine-tuning and rectification stages. Empirical analysis validates our framework, demonstrating improved estimation and inference performance compared to using either fine-tuning or rectification alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u914d\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u6837\u672c\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u6821\u6b63\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5c06\u4e24\u8005\u7ed3\u5408\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u6837\u672c\u5206\u914d\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u65b9\u5dee\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e3a\u5fae\u8c03\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u4f18\u5316\u6837\u672c\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u6821\u6b63\u9636\u6bb5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u5728\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u63a8\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u5408\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

While personalized multidisciplinary interventions have the potential to slow disease progression and enhance quality of life, they typically require substantial medical resources and expertise, making them difficult to implement in resource-limited settings. To address this challenge, we developed KOM, a multi-agent system designed to automate KOA evaluation, risk prediction, and treatment prescription. This system assists clinicians in performing essential tasks across the KOA care pathway and supports the generation of tailored management plans based on individual patient profiles, disease status, risk factors, and contraindications. In benchmark experiments, KOM demonstrated superior performance compared to several general-purpose large language models in imaging analysis and prescription generation. A randomized three-arm simulation study further revealed that collaboration between KOM and clinicians reduced total diagnostic and planning time by 38.5% and resulted in improved treatment quality compared to each approach used independently. These findings indicate that KOM could help facilitate automated KOA management and, when integrated into clinical workflows, has the potential to enhance care efficiency.

Building on structural analogies with MHD, we formulate a finite element framework compatible with the de Rham complex, so that the discrete velocity is exactly divergence-free. The spatial discretisation combines an interior-penalty treatment of viscosity with upwind transport to control stress layers and we prove inf-sup conditions on the mixed pairs. For time-stepping, we design an IMEX scheme that is linear at each step and show well-posedness of the fully discrete problem together with a discrete energy law mirroring the continuum dissipation. Numerical experiments on canonical benchmarks (lid-driven cavity, pipe-with-cavity and $4{:}1$ planar contraction) demonstrate accuracy and robustness for moderate-to-high Weissenberg numbers, capturing sharp stress gradients and corner singularities while retaining the efficiency gains of the uniaxial model. The results indicate that de Rham-compatible discretisations coupled with energy-stable IMEX time integration provide a reliable pathway for viscoelastic computations at elevated elasticity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Oldroyd-B\u805a\u5408\u7269\u6eb6\u6db2\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u7ef4\u7b80\u5316\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8ede Rham\u590d\u5f62\u7684\u6709\u9650\u5143\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5185\u7f5a\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8fce\u98ce\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027IMEX\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9ad8Weissenberg\u6570\u4e0b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u5f39\u6027\u805a\u5408\u7269\u6d41\u52a8\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u503c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8Weissenberg\u6570\u4e0b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u91cf\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u5904\u7406\u5c16\u9510\u5e94\u529b\u68af\u5ea6\u548c\u89d2\u70b9\u5947\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e0ede Rham\u590d\u5f62\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u6709\u9650\u5143\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u79bb\u6563\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u4e25\u683c\u65e0\u6563\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u5185\u7f5a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u7c98\u6027\u548c\u8fce\u98ce\u4f20\u8f93\u63a7\u5236\u5e94\u529b\u5c42\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ebf\u6027IMEX\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6df7\u5408\u5bf9\u6ee1\u8db3inf-sup\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u57fa\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u76d6\u9a71\u52a8\u8154\u3001\u5e26\u8154\u7ba1\u9053\u548c4:1\u5e73\u9762\u6536\u7f29\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u81f3\u9ad8Weissenberg\u6570\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u5c16\u9510\u5e94\u529b\u68af\u5ea6\u548c\u89d2\u70b9\u5947\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u7ef4\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "de Rham\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u4e0e\u80fd\u91cf\u7a33\u5b9aIMEX\u65f6\u95f4\u79ef\u5206\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5f39\u6027\u7c98\u5f39\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8Weissenberg\u6570\u4e0b\u7684\u6570\u503c\u56f0\u96be\u3002"}}

Yet empirical studies on natural language repeatedly report a \"reversal curse,\" and recent work on temporal asymmetry in LLMs suggests that real-world corpora carry their own arrow of time. This leaves an unresolved question: do directional failures stem from linguistic statistics, or from the architecture itself? We cut through this ambiguity with a fully synthetic, entropy-controlled benchmark designed as a clean-room stress test for directional learning. Using random string mappings with tunable branching factor K, we construct forward tasks with zero conditional entropy and inverse tasks with analytically determined entropy floors. Excess loss above these floors reveals that even scratch-trained GPT-2 models exhibit a strong, reproducible directional optimization gap (e.g., 1.16 nats at K=5), far larger than that of an MLP trained on the same data. Pre-trained initializations shift optimization behavior but do not eliminate this gap, while LoRA encounters a sharp capacity wall on high-entropy inverse mappings. Together, these results isolate a minimal, semantics-free signature of directional friction intrinsic to causal Transformer training-one that persists even when linguistic priors, token frequencies, and corpus-level temporal asymmetries are removed. Our benchmark provides a controlled instrument for dissecting directional biases in modern sequence models and motivates deeper mechanistic study of why inversion remains fundamentally harder for Transformers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u672c\u8eab\u5b58\u5728\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u65e0\u8bed\u8a00\u7edf\u8ba1\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\uff0c\u56e0\u679cTransformer\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u524d\u5411-\u9006\u5411\u4f18\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3Transformer\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7684\"\u9006\u8f6c\u8bc5\u5492\"\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u5931\u8d25\u662f\u6e90\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u8fd8\u662f\u67b6\u6784\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u5185\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5b8c\u5168\u5408\u6210\u7684\u3001\u71b5\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8c03\u5206\u652f\u56e0\u5b50K\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u6620\u5c04\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u96f6\u6761\u4ef6\u71b5\u7684\u524d\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u5177\u6709\u89e3\u6790\u71b5\u4e0b\u9650\u7684\u9006\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5373\u4f7f\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684GPT-2\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\uff08\u5982K=5\u65f61.16 nats\uff09\uff0c\u8fdc\u5927\u4e8e\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684MLP\u3002\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u4f46\u672a\u6d88\u9664\u6b64\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u79bb\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u3001\u65e0\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u6469\u64e6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u56e0\u679cTransformer\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u79fb\u9664\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u3001\u8bcd\u9891\u548c\u8bed\u6599\u7ea7\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u540e\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u3002"}}

However, existing formulations based on isotropic kernels often suffer from spurious oscillations in regions with sharp gradients or strong flow anisotropy. This work introduces an anisotropic, gradient-informed, and adaptively sampled extension of the constrained RBF framework for regression of scattered data. Gradient information is estimated via local polynomial regression at collocation points, smoothed, and used to (1) re-sample data, maximizing sampling density near steep gradients while downsampling in smooth regions, and (2) construct a local anisotropic metric that shapes each basis function according to the flow directionality. In addition, a gradient-informed regularization is introduced by embedding observed gradients into the least-squares system as weighted soft constraints. The resulting formulation is fully meshless, linear, and computationally efficient, while significantly improving reconstruction quality in challenging regions. The method is evaluated on both synthetic and experimental datasets, including direct numerical simulation (DNS) data of a turbulent channel and time-resolved particle tracking velocimetry of a turbulent jet. Results show that the proposed approach outperforms isotropic and gradient-free RBF formulations in accuracy, smoothness, and physical consistency -- particularly near shear layers and boundaries -- while reducing the number of bases by an order of magnitude.

However, the utility of the RF proximities depends upon the success of the RF model, which itself is not the ideal model in all contexts. RF proximities have recently been extended to time series by means of the distance-based Proximity Forest (PF) model, among others, affording time series analysis with the benefits of RF proximities. In this work, we introduce the generalized PF model, thereby extending RF proximities to all contexts in which supervised distance-based machine learning can occur.

Existing methods typically rely on extensive task-specific annotations and fine-tuning, limiting their ability to generalize effectively to novel or out-of-distribution scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce GroundingAgent, a novel agentic visual grounding framework that operates without any task-specific fine-tuning. GroundingAgent employs a structured, iterative reasoning mechanism that integrates pretrained open-vocabulary object detectors, multimodal large language models (MLLMs), and large language models (LLMs) to progressively refine candidate regions through joint semantic and spatial analyses. Remarkably, GroundingAgent achieves an average zero-shot grounding accuracy of 65.1 % on widely-used benchmarks (RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg), entirely without fine-tuning. Furthermore, by substituting MLLM-generated captions with the original query texts, the accuracy at the selection stage alone reaches approximately 90 %, closely matching supervised performance and underscoring the critical role of LLM reasoning capabilities.

Existing query-dependent approaches rely on unstable textual feedback or black-box reward models, providing weak and uninterpretable optimization signals. More fundamentally, prompt quality itself lacks a unified, systematic definition, resulting in fragmented and unreliable evaluation signals. Our approach first establishes a performance-oriented, systematic, and comprehensive prompt evaluation framework. Furthermore, we develop and finetune an execution-free evaluator that predicts multi-dimensional quality scores directly from text. The evaluator then instructs a metric-aware optimizer that diagnoses failure modes and rewrites prompts in an interpretable, query-dependent manner. Our evaluator achieves the strongest accuracy in predicting prompt performance, and the evaluation-instructed optimization consistently surpass both static-template and query-dependent baselines across eight datasets and on three backbone models.

The method augments continuous piecewise linear velocity spaces with elementwise bubble functions, yielding a locally conservative velocity approximation while retaining the efficiency of low-order continuous elements. The viscous term is discretized using a symmetric interior penalty formulation, and the divergence constraint is imposed through a stable pressure space. To enhance the robustness of the velocity approximation with respect to the pressure, a reconstruction operator is introduced in the convective and coupling terms, resulting in a pressure-robust scheme whose accuracy does not deteriorate for small viscosities. Both Picard and Newton linearizations are formulated in a fully discrete manner, and the corresponding linear systems are assembled efficiently at each iteration. Optimal a~priori error estimates are established for the velocity in the mesh-dependent energy norm and for the pressure in the $L^2$ norm. Two representative numerical experiments are presented: a smooth manufactured solution and the lid-driven cavity flow. The numerical results confirm the theoretical convergence rates, demonstrating first-order convergence of the velocity in the energy norm, second-order convergence in the $L^2$ norm, and first-order convergence of the pressure. The proposed EG scheme accurately captures characteristic flow structures, illustrating its effectiveness and robustness for incompressible flow simulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u53ef\u538b\u7f29Navier-Stokes\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u589e\u5f3aGalerkin\u6709\u9650\u5143\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6dfb\u52a0\u5355\u5143\u6c14\u6ce1\u51fd\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c40\u90e8\u5b88\u6052\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u91cd\u6784\u7b97\u5b50\u786e\u4fdd\u538b\u529b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u9636\u8fde\u7eed\u5143\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c40\u90e8\u5b88\u6052\u4e14\u5bf9\u538b\u529b\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u6d41\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5c0f\u7c98\u5ea6\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u5206\u6bb5\u7ebf\u6027\u901f\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u6dfb\u52a0\u5355\u5143\u6c14\u6ce1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u79f0\u5185\u7f5a\u65b9\u6cd5\u79bb\u6563\u7c98\u6027\u9879\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a33\u5b9a\u538b\u529b\u7a7a\u95f4\u65bd\u52a0\u6563\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5728\u5bf9\u6d41\u9879\u548c\u8026\u5408\u9879\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u91cd\u6784\u7b97\u5b50\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6536\u655b\u7387\uff1a\u901f\u5ea6\u5728\u80fd\u91cf\u8303\u6570\u4e2d\u4e00\u9636\u6536\u655b\u3001L\u00b2\u8303\u6570\u4e2d\u4e8c\u9636\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u538b\u529b\u4e00\u9636\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u7279\u5f81\u6d41\u52a8\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684EG\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u6d41\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5728\u5c0f\u7c98\u5ea6\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Our results demonstrate that end-to-end fine-tuning is critical for performance, with the domain-adapted MentalBERT emerging as the top model, achieving an accuracy of 0.92 and a Macro F1 score of 0.76, surpassing both its generic counterpart and a zero-shot LLM baseline. Grounded in a comprehensive ethical analysis, we frame the system as a human-in-the-loop screening aid, not a diagnostic tool. To support this, we introduce a hybrid SHAPLLM explainability framework and present a prototype dashboard (\"Social Media Screener\") designed to integrate model predictions and their explanations into a practical workflow for moderators. Our work provides a robust baseline, highlighting future needs for multi-label, clinically-validated datasets at the critical intersection of online safety and computational mental health.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b10\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u9738\u51cc\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u5b57\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u6311\u6218\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u9738\u51cc\u65e5\u76ca\u666e\u904d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Twitter\u548cReddit\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\"\u5206\u5272\u540e\u5e73\u8861\"\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u8bcd\u6c47\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5fae\u8c03transformer\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5fae\u8c03\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u7684MentalBERT\u6210\u4e3a\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe0.92\uff0cMacro F1\u5f97\u5206\u4e3a0.76\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672cLLM\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u88ab\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e3a\u4eba\u5de5\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u7b5b\u67e5\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\u800c\u975e\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6df7\u5408SHAPLLM\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u539f\u578b\u4eea\u8868\u677f\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u7ebf\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002"}}

However, existing CSI feedback models struggle to adapt to dynamic environments caused by user mobility, requiring retraining when encountering new CSI distributions. Moreover, returning to previously encountered environments often leads to performance degradation due to catastrophic forgetting. Continual learning involves enabling models to incorporate new information while maintaining performance on previously learned tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based learning approach for CSI feedback. By using a GAN generator as a memory unit, our method preserves knowledge from past environments and ensures consistently high performance across diverse scenarios without forgetting.

This yields a unified criterion that jointly considers structural sparsity and informational efficiency. Building on this foundation, we further design two complementary schemes: (1) a training-based head pruning guided by the proposed information loss objective, and (2) a training-free FFN compression via adaptive low-rank approximation.

Temporal logic expressible via the more general class of $\u03c9$-regular objectives addresses this by precisely specifying rich behavioural properties. Even still, measuring performance by a single scalar (be it reward or satisfaction probability) masks safety-performance trade-offs that arise in settings with a tolerable level of risk.\n  We address both limitations simultaneously by combining $\u03c9$-regular objectives with explicit constraints, allowing safety requirements and optimisation targets to be treated separately. We develop a model-based RL algorithm based on linear programming, which in the limit produces a policy maximising the probability of satisfying an $\u03c9$-regular objective while also adhering to $\u03c9$-regular constraints within specified thresholds. Furthermore, we establish a translation to constrained limit-average problems with optimality-preserving guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u03c9-\u6b63\u5219\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6807\u91cf\u5956\u52b1\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027-\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f9d\u8d56\u6807\u91cf\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u5956\u52b1\u7834\u89e3\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u6e05\u6670\u8868\u8fbe\u65f6\u95f4\u6027\u3001\u6761\u4ef6\u6027\u6216\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5355\u4e00\u6807\u91cf\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u63a9\u76d6\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027-\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u03c9-\u6b63\u5219\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u8981\u6c42\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5f00\u5904\u7406\u3002\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5230\u7ea6\u675f\u6781\u9650\u5e73\u5747\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6781\u9650\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6ee1\u8db3\u03c9-\u6b63\u5219\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u03c9-\u6b63\u5219\u7ea6\u675f\u5728\u6307\u5b9a\u9608\u503c\u5185\u5f97\u5230\u9075\u5b88\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u76ee\u6807\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027-\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u884c\u4e3a\u89c4\u8303\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002"}}

In this continuum model of electrical impedance tomography (EIT), the boundary measurements are realized as a noisy perturbation of the Neumann-to-Dirichlet map's integral kernel. The theoretical analysis proceeds by extending the domain of the inversion operator to a Hilbert space of kernel functions. The resulting extension shares the same stability properties as the original inverse map from kernels to conductivities, but is now amenable to neural operator approximation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that Fourier neural operators excel at reconstructing infinite-dimensional piecewise constant and lognormal conductivities in noisy setups both within and beyond the theory's assumptions.

We introduce the Eyelid Angle (ELA), a novel, reproducible metric of eye openness derived from 3D facial landmarks. Unlike conventional binary eye state estimators or 2D measures, such as the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), the ELA provides a stable geometric description of eyelid motion that is robust to variations in camera angle. Using the ELA, we design a blink detection framework that extracts temporal characteristics, including the closing, closed, and reopening durations, which are shown to correlate with drowsiness levels. To address the scarcity and risk of collecting natural drowsiness data, we further leverage ELA signals to animate rigged avatars in Blender 3D, enabling the creation of realistic synthetic datasets with controllable noise, camera viewpoints, and blink dynamics.

This paper introduces MicroSims a novel framework for creating lightweight, interactive educational simulations that can be rapidly generated using artificial intelligence, universally embedded across digital learning platforms, and easily customized without programming knowledge. MicroSims occupy a unique position at the intersection of three key innovations: (1) standardized design patterns that enable AI-assisted generation, (2) iframe-based architecture that provides universal embedding and sandboxed security, and (3) transparent, modifiable code that supports customization and pedagogical transparency. We present a comprehensive framework encompassing design principles, technical architecture, metadata standards, and development workflows. Drawing on empirical research from physics education studies and meta-analyses across STEM disciplines, we demonstrate that interactive simulations can improve conceptual understanding by up to 30-40\\% compared to traditional instruction. MicroSims extend these benefits while addressing persistent barriers of cost, technical complexity, and platform dependence. This work has significant implications for educational equity, and low-cost intelligent interactive textbooks that enabling educators worldwide to create customized, curriculum-aligned simulations on demand.

Highly refined, dynamically adaptive spatial discretization is typically required, leading to prohibitive computational costs. Semi-analytical approaches mitigate this by decomposing the temperature field into an analytical point-source solution and a complementary numerical field that enforces boundary conditions. However, state-of-the-art implementations either necessitate extensive mesh refinement near boundaries or rely on restrictive image source techniques, limiting their efficiency and applicability to complex geometries. This study presents a novel reformulation of the semi-analytical framework using Isogeometric Analysis. The laser heat input is captured by the analytical point-source solution, while the complementary correction field, which imposes boundary conditions, is solved using a spline-based IGA discretization. The governing heat equation for the correction field is cast in a weak form, discretized with NURBS basis functions, and advanced in time using an implicit $\u03b8$-scheme. This approach leverages IGA's key advantages: exact geometry representation, higher-order continuity, and superior accuracy per degree of freedom. These features unlock efficient thermal modeling of realistic parts with complex contours. Our strategy eliminates the need for scan-wise remeshing and robustly handles intricate geometric features like sharp corners and varying cross-sections. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed semi-analytical IGA method delivers accurate temperature predictions and achieves substantial computational efficiency gains compared to standard FEM, establishing it as a powerful new tool for high-fidelity thermal simulation in LPBF.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b49\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u6790\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u534a\u89e3\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6fc0\u5149\u7c89\u672b\u5e8a\u7194\u878d\u7684\u70ed\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u89e3\u6790\u70b9\u6e90\u89e3\u548cIGA\u79bb\u6563\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u573a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u70ed\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6709\u9650\u5143\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728LPBF\u70ed\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u9661\u5ced\u70ed\u68af\u5ea6\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7ec6\u5316\u7684\u7f51\u683c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u534a\u89e3\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u6548\u7387\u9650\u5236\u6216\u51e0\u4f55\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6e29\u5ea6\u573a\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u89e3\u6790\u70b9\u6e90\u89e3\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\u573a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eNURBS\u7684\u7b49\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u6790\u79bb\u6563\u4fee\u6b63\u573a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9690\u5f0f\u03b8\u683c\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u8fdb\uff0c\u5229\u7528IGA\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7cbe\u786e\u8868\u793a\u548c\u9ad8\u9636\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7b97\u4f8b\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u6e29\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6FEM\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7a33\u5065\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u534a\u89e3\u6790IGA\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3aLPBF\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u70ed\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u626b\u63cf\u7ea7\u91cd\u7f51\u683c\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u96f6\u4ef6\u5efa\u6a21\u3002"}}

However, the prevalent approach of fine-tuning a separate module for each user faces two major limitations: (1) storage costs scale linearly with the number of users, rendering the method unscalable; and (2) fine-tuning a static model from scratch often yields suboptimal performance for users with sparse data. To address these challenges, we propose MTA, a Merge-then-Adapt framework for PLLMs. MTA comprises three key stages. First, we construct a shared Meta-LoRA Bank by selecting anchor users and pre-training meta-personalization traits within meta-LoRA modules. Second, to ensure scalability and enable dynamic personalization combination beyond static models, we introduce an Adaptive LoRA Fusion stage. This stage retrieves and dynamically merges the most relevant anchor meta-LoRAs to synthesize a user-specific one, thereby eliminating the need for user-specific storage and supporting more flexible personalization. Third, we propose a LoRA Stacking for Few-Shot Personalization stage, which applies an additional ultra-low-rank, lightweight LoRA module on top of the merged LoRA. Fine-tuning this module enables effective personalization under few-shot settings.

Regression, unsupervised learning, CLIQUE importance, and RF-GAP proximity are planned for v2.0.\n  This work introduces four solutions addressing the proximity matrix memory bottleneck limiting Random Forest analysis to ~60,000 samples: (1) QLORA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) compression for GPU proximity matrices, reducing memory from 80GB to 6.4MB for 100k samples (12,500x compression with INT8 quantization) while maintaining 99% geometric structure preservation, (2) CPU TriBlock proximity--combining upper-triangle storage with block-sparse thresholding--achieving 2.7x memory reduction with lossless quality, (3) SM-aware GPU batch sizing achieving 95% GPU utilization, and (4) GPU-accelerated 3D MDS visualization computing embeddings directly from low-rank factors using power iteration.\n  Validation across four implementation modes (GPU/CPU x case-wise/non-case-wise) demonstrates correct implementation. GPU achieves 1.4x speedup over CPU for overall importance with 500+ trees.

However, most of them adopt static and non-learnable tool invocation mechanisms, which limit the discovery of diverse clues essential for robust perception and reasoning regarding temporally or spatially complex videos. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Multi-agent system for video understanding, namely VideoChat-M1. Instead of using a single or fixed policy, VideoChat-M1 adopts a distinct Collaborative Policy Planning (CPP) paradigm with multiple policy agents, which comprises three key processes. (1) Policy Generation: Each agent generates its unique tool invocation policy tailored to the user's query; (2) Policy Execution: Each agent sequentially invokes relevant tools to execute its policy and explore the video content; (3) Policy Communication: During the intermediate stages of policy execution, agents interact with one another to update their respective policies. Through this collaborative framework, all agents work in tandem, dynamically refining their preferred policies based on contextual insights from peers to effectively respond to the user's query. Moreover, we equip our CPP paradigm with a concise Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) method. Consequently, the team of policy agents can be jointly optimized to enhance VideoChat-M1's performance, guided by both the final answer reward and intermediate collaborative process feedback. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoChat-M1 achieves SOTA performance across eight benchmarks spanning four tasks.

To address these limitations, we propose a collaborative Conversational Embodied Intelligence Network (CC-EIN) integrating multimodal feature fusion, adaptive semantic communication, task coordination, and interpretability. PerceptiNet performs cross-modal fusion of image and radar data to generate unified semantic representations. An adaptive semantic communication strategy dynamically adjusts coding schemes and transmission power according to task urgency and channel quality. A semantic-driven collaboration mechanism further supports task decomposition and conflict-free coordination among heterogeneous devices.

However, existing approaches face key limitations: answer choices are typically presented to LLMs without contextual grounding or explanation. This absence of context can lead to incomplete exploration of all possible answers, ultimately degrading the models' reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce BiasPrompting, a novel inference framework that guides LLMs to generate and critically evaluate reasoning across all plausible answer options before reaching a final prediction.

Among the dominant compression techniques: knowledge distillation, structured pruning, and low-bit quantization, their individual effects are well studied, but their interactions and optimal sequencing remain unclear. This work systematically examines how these techniques perform both independently and in combination when applied to the Qwen2.5 3B model. We evaluate multiple compression pipelines, including single, and proposed three-technique sequences, using perplexity, G-Eval, clarity, prompt alignment, and compression ratio as metrics. Our experiments show that quantization provides the greatest standalone compression, while pruning introduces moderate quality degradation. Critically, the ordering of techniques significantly affects the final model quality: the sequence Pruning, Knowledge Distillation, Quantization (P-KD-Q) yields the best balance, achieving a 3.68x compression ratio while preserving strong instruction-following and language understanding capabilities. Conversely, pipelines applying quantization early suffer severe performance degradation due to irreversible information loss that impairs subsequent training.

While this form of reasoning is fundamental to human cognition, current vision-language benchmarks lack comprehensive evaluation of this ability and instead focus on surface-level recognition or image-text alignment.\n  To address this gap, we introduce Perceptual Taxonomy, a benchmark for physically grounded visual reasoning. We annotate 3173 objects with four property families covering 84 fine-grained attributes. Using these annotations, we construct a multiple-choice question benchmark with 5802 images across both synthetic and real domains. The benchmark contains 28033 template-based questions spanning four types (object description, spatial reasoning, property matching, and taxonomy reasoning), along with 50 expert-crafted questions designed to evaluate models across the full spectrum of perceptual taxonomy reasoning.\n  Experimental results show that leading vision-language models perform well on recognition tasks but degrade by 10 to 20 percent on property-driven questions, especially those requiring multi-step reasoning over structured attributes. These findings highlight a persistent gap in structured visual understanding and the limitations of current models that rely heavily on pattern matching.

We adapted the 10-item General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) to elicit simulated self-assessments from ten LLMs across four conditions: no task, computational reasoning, social reasoning, and summarization. GSES responses were highly stable across repeated administrations and randomized item orders. However, models showed significantly different self-efficacy levels across conditions, with aggregate scores lower than human norms. All models achieved perfect accuracy on computational and social questions, whereas summarization performance varied widely. Self-assessment did not reliably reflect ability: several low-scoring models performed accurately, while some high-scoring models produced weaker summaries.

However, increasing their complexity often fails to substantially improve their accuracy, leaving them on par with much simpler approaches such as kernel methods and more traditional reduced-order models. In this article, we set out to address this shortcoming and introduce CHONKNORIS (Cholesky Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), an operator learning paradigm that can achieve machine precision. CHONKNORIS draws on numerical analysis: many nonlinear forward and inverse PDE problems are solvable by Newton-type methods. Rather than regressing the solution operator itself, our method regresses the Cholesky factors of the elliptic operator associated with Tikhonov-regularized Newton--Kantorovich updates. The resulting unrolled iteration yields a neural architecture whose machine-precision behavior follows from achieving a contractive map, requiring far lower accuracy than end-to-end approximation of the solution operator. We benchmark CHONKNORIS on a range of nonlinear forward and inverse problems, including a nonlinear elliptic equation, Burgers' equation, a nonlinear Darcy flow problem, the Calder\u00f3n problem, an inverse wave scattering problem, and a problem from seismic imaging. We also present theoretical guarantees for the convergence of CHONKNORIS in terms of the accuracy of the emulated Cholesky factors. Additionally, we introduce a foundation model variant, FONKNORIS (Foundation Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), which aggregates multiple pre-trained CHONKNORIS experts for diverse PDEs to emulate the solution map of a novel nonlinear PDE. Our FONKNORIS model is able to accurately solve unseen nonlinear PDEs such as the Klein--Gordon and Sine--Gordon equations.", "AI": {"tldr": "CHONKNORIS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u8fbe\u5230\u673a\u5668\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56de\u5f52Tikhonov\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u725b\u987f-\u5eb7\u6258\u7f57\u7ef4\u5947\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u692d\u5706\u7b97\u5b50\u7684Cholesky\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u76f4\u63a5\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7b97\u5b50\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6c42\u89e3\u975e\u7ebf\u6027PDE\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u589e\u52a0\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u65f6\u5f80\u5f80\u65e0\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e0e\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u964d\u9636\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u8fbe\u5230\u673a\u5668\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "CHONKNORIS\u65b9\u6cd5\u56de\u5f52\u692d\u5706\u7b97\u5b50\u7684Cholesky\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c55\u5f00\u8fed\u4ee3\u4ea7\u751f\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5176\u673a\u5668\u7cbe\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\u6765\u6e90\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u6536\u7f29\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u6bd4\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8fd1\u4f3c\u89e3\u7b97\u5b50\u9700\u8981\u4f4e\u5f97\u591a\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u692d\u5706\u65b9\u7a0b\u3001Burgers\u65b9\u7a0b\u3001\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8fbe\u897f\u6d41\u95ee\u9898\u3001Calder\u00f3n\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u9006\u6ce2\u6563\u5c04\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u5730\u9707\u6210\u50cf\u95ee\u9898\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "CHONKNORIS\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u503c\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u725b\u987f\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5176\u53d8\u4f53FONKNORIS\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u6c42\u89e3\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027PDE\u5982Klein-Gordon\u548cSine-Gordon\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002"}}

Sparse attention mitigates this cost by restricting each query to attend to a subset of previous tokens; however, training-free approaches often lead to severe performance degradation. Native sparse-attention methods (e.g., NSA, MoBA) alleviate this issue, yet exhibit a critical paradox: they produce lower attention sparsity than full-attention models, despite aiming to approximate full attention, which may constrain their effectiveness. We attribute this paradox to gradient update deficiency: low-ranked key-value pairs excluded during sparse training receive neither forward contribution nor backward gradients, and thus never learn proper suppression. To overcome this limitation, we propose SSA (Sparse Sparse Attention), a unified training framework that considers both sparse and full attention and enforces bidirectional alignment at every layer. This design preserves gradient flow to all tokens while explicitly encouraging sparse-attention outputs to align with their full-attention counterparts, thereby promoting stronger sparsity. As a result, SSA achieves state-of-the-art performance under both sparse and full attention inference across multiple commonsense benchmarks. Furthermore, SSA enables models to adapt smoothly to varying sparsity budgets; performance improves consistently as more tokens are allowed to attend, supporting flexible compute-performance trade-offs at inference time. Finally, we show that native sparse-attention training surprisingly improves long-context extrapolation by mitigating the over-allocation of attention values in sink areas, with SSA demonstrating the strongest extrapolation capability.", "AI": {"tldr": "SSA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u7f3a\u9677\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6096\u8bba\uff1a\u867d\u7136\u65e8\u5728\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u53cd\u800c\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u7f3a\u9677\u2014\u2014\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u88ab\u6392\u9664\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u952e\u503c\u5bf9\u65e2\u6ca1\u6709\u524d\u5411\u8d21\u732e\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u540e\u5411\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u6291\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSSA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u5c42\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u53cc\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u6240\u6709token\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u5f0f\u9f13\u52b1\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u5176\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5bf9\u5e94\u7269\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3002", "result": "SSA\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5e38\u8bc6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a8\u7406\u4e0b\u90fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5e73\u6ed1\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u5141\u8bb8\u66f4\u591atoken\u53c2\u4e0e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u8ba1\u7b97-\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u539f\u751f\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bad\u7ec3\u901a\u8fc7\u7f13\u89e3\u6c47\u70b9\u533a\u57df\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u503c\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u610f\u5916\u5730\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5916\u63a8\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dSSA\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u5916\u63a8\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

The online construction of HD maps offers a scalable approach to generate local maps from on-board sensors. However, existing methods typically rely on costly 3D map annotations for training, which limits their generalization and scalability across diverse driving environments. In this work, we propose MapRF, a weakly supervised framework that learns to construct 3D maps using only 2D image labels. To generate high-quality pseudo labels, we introduce a novel Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) module conditioned on map predictions, which reconstructs view-consistent 3D geometry and semantics. These pseudo labels are then iteratively used to refine the map network in a self-training manner, enabling progressive improvement without additional supervision. Furthermore, to mitigate error accumulation during self-training, we propose a Map-to-Ray Matching strategy that aligns map predictions with camera rays derived from 2D labels. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse 2 and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that MapRF achieves performance comparable to fully supervised methods, attaining around 75% of the baseline while surpassing several approaches using only 2D labels. This highlights the potential of MapRF to enable scalable and cost-effective online HD map construction for autonomous driving.", "AI": {"tldr": "MapRF\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75282D\u56fe\u50cf\u6807\u7b7e\u5b66\u4e60\u6784\u5efa3D\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7NeRF\u6a21\u5757\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u5e76\u5728\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76HD\u5730\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5728\u7ebfHD\u5730\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u76843D\u5730\u56fe\u6807\u6ce8\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9a7e\u9a76\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6NeRF\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u76843D\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u5f0f\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u5730\u56fe\u7f51\u7edc\uff1b\u5f15\u5165Map-to-Ray\u5339\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u9f50\u5730\u56fe\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e2D\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u5149\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "\u5728Argoverse 2\u548cnuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMapRF\u8fbe\u5230\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ea675%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75282D\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MapRF\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u7684\u5728\u7ebfHD\u5730\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

By utilizing knowledge base retrieval, RPM-MCTS avoids the complex training of process reward models. During the expansion phase, similarity filtering is employed to remove redundant nodes, ensuring diversity in reasoning paths. Furthermore, our method utilizes sandbox execution feedback to locate erroneous algorithmic steps during generation, enabling timely and targeted corrections. Extensive experiments on four public code generation benchmarks demonstrate that RPM-MCTS outperforms current state-of-the-art methods while achieving an approximately 15% reduction in token consumption.

Despite these advancements, its utilization in time series forecasting (TSF) has yet to meet expectations. Exploring a better network structure for attention in TSF holds immense significance across various domains. In this paper, we present PeriodNet with a brand new structure to forecast univariate and multivariate time series. PeriodNet incorporates period attention and sparse period attention mechanism for analyzing adjacent periods. It enhances the mining of local characteristics, periodic patterns, and global dependencies. For efficient cross-variable modeling, we introduce an iterative grouping mechanism which can directly reduce the cross-variable redundancy. To fully leverage the extracted features on the encoder side, we redesign the entire architecture of the vanilla Transformer and propose a period diffuser for precise multi-period prediction. Through comprehensive experiments conducted on eight datasets, we demonstrate that PeriodNet outperforms six state-of-the-art models in both univariate and multivariate TSF scenarios in terms of mean square error and mean absolute error.

Vidi models continue to evolve toward next-generation video creation and have achieved state-of-the-art performance in multimodal temporal retrieval (TR). In its second release, Vidi2 advances video understanding with fine-grained spatio-temporal grounding (STG) and extends its capability to video question answering (Video QA), enabling comprehensive multimodal reasoning. Given a text query, Vidi2 can identify not only the corresponding timestamps but also the bounding boxes of target objects within the output time ranges. This end-to-end spatio-temporal grounding capability enables potential applications in complex editing scenarios, such as plot or character understanding, automatic multi-view switching, and intelligent, composition-aware reframing and cropping. To enable comprehensive evaluation of STG in practical settings, we introduce a new benchmark, VUE-STG, which offers four key improvements over existing STG datasets: 1) Video duration: spans from roughly 10s to 30 mins, enabling long-context reasoning; 2) Query format: queries are mostly converted into noun phrases while preserving sentence-level expressiveness; 3) Annotation quality: all ground-truth time ranges and bounding boxes are manually annotated with high accuracy; 4) Evaluation metric: a refined vIoU/tIoU/vIoU-Intersection scheme.

However, there is evidence that current semantic similarity methods may capture syntactic or lexical forms over semantic content. While benchmarks exist for semantic equivalence, they often suffer from high generation costs due to reliance on subjective human judgment, limited availability for domain-specific applications, and unclear definitions of equivalence. This paper introduces a novel method for generating benchmarks to evaluate semantic similarity methods for LLM outputs, specifically addressing these limitations. Our approach leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to generate pairs of natural-language statements that are semantically similar or dissimilar, with dissimilar pairs categorized into one of four sub-types. We generate benchmark datasets in four different domains (general knowledge, biomedicine, finance, biology), and conduct a comparative study of semantic similarity methods including traditional natural language processing scores and LLM-as-a-judge predictions. We observe that the sub-type of semantic variation, as well as the domain of the benchmark impact the performance of semantic similarity methods, with no method being consistently superior. Our results present important implications for the use of LLM-as-a-judge in detecting the semantic content of text.

By leveraging structured prompts and fine-tuning, the model integrates detection, localization, and quantification within a unified schema. Cross-regional evaluation using the $\u0394$F1 metric demonstrates that the proposed model achieves the smallest performance degradation across unseen regions, outperforming conventional CV and transformer baselines. These results highlight the robustness of multimodal LLMs under domain shift and their potential for scalable, transferable, and interpretable global PV mapping.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u5149\u4f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u533a\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfCV\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5149\u4f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6269\u5f20\u7ed9\u7535\u7f51\u7ba1\u7406\u5e26\u6765\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u5b89\u88c5\u672a\u8bb0\u5f55\u5728\u6848\u3002\u4f20\u7edfCV\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u8de8\u533a\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5c06\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u7403\u5149\u4f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u8de8\u533a\u57df\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u533a\u57df\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u6700\u5c0f\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfCV\u548ctransformer\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u0394F1\u6307\u6807\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u5728\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5168\u7403\u5149\u4f0f\u6d4b\u7ed8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, their behavior in production environments remains poorly understood, and their failure patterns differ fundamentally from those of traditional machine learning models. This paper presents a system-level taxonomy of fifteen hidden failure modes that arise in real-world LLM applications, including multi-step reasoning drift, latent inconsistency, context-boundary degradation, incorrect tool invocation, version drift, and cost-driven performance collapse. Using this taxonomy, we analyze the growing gap in evaluation and monitoring practices: existing benchmarks measure knowledge or reasoning but provide little insight into stability, reproducibility, drift, or workflow integration. We further examine the production challenges associated with deploying LLMs - including observability limitations, cost constraints, and update-induced regressions - and outline high-level design principles for building reliable, maintainable, and cost-aware LLM systems. Finally, we outline high-level design principles for building reliable, maintainable, and cost-aware LLM-based systems.

While recent advances in transformer-based models and large annotated datasets have greatly improved GEC performance for high-resource languages such as English, the progress has not extended equally. For most Indic languages, GEC remains a challenging task due to limited resources, linguistic diversity and complex morphology. In this work, we explore prompting-based approaches using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4.1, Gemini-2.5 and LLaMA-4, combined with few-shot strategy to adapt them to low-resource settings. We observe that even basic prompting strategies, such as zero-shot and few-shot approaches, enable these LLMs to substantially outperform fine-tuned Indic-language models like Sarvam-22B, thereby illustrating the exceptional multilingual generalization capabilities of contemporary LLMs for GEC. Our experiments show that carefully designed prompts and lightweight adaptation significantly enhance correction quality across multiple Indic languages.

These generators are typically based on a few core architectural families, primarily Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs). A critical vulnerability in current forensics is the failure of detectors to achieve cross-generator generalization, especially when crossing architectural boundaries (e.g., from GANs to DMs). We hypothesize that this gap stems from fundamental differences in the artifacts produced by these \\textbf{distinct architectures}. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis explaining how the distinct optimization objectives of the GAN and DM architectures lead to different manifold coverage behaviors. We demonstrate that GANs permit partial coverage, often leading to boundary artifacts, while DMs enforce complete coverage, resulting in over-smoothing patterns. Motivated by this analysis, we propose the \\textbf{Tri}archy \\textbf{Detect}or (TriDetect), a semi-supervised approach that enhances binary classification by discovering latent architectural patterns within the \"fake\" class. TriDetect employs balanced cluster assignment via the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm and a cross-view consistency mechanism, encouraging the model to learn fundamental architectural distincts.

The spatial focus of cartography is analyzed in relation to political dynamics, evidencing links between Atlantic maritime charting, the triangular trade, and colonial expansion. Further results document the progression of national, domestic focus and the impact of military conflicts on publication volumes. The research introduces semantic segmentation techniques and object detection models for the generic recognition of land classes and cartographic signs, trained on annotated data and synthetic images. The analysis of land classes shows that maps are designed images whose framing and composition emphasize features through centering and semantic symmetries. The study of cartographic figuration encodes 63 M signs and 25 M fragments into a latent visual space, revealing figurative shifts such as the replacement of relief hachures by terrain contours and showing that signs tend to form locally consistent systems. Analyses of collaboration and diffusion highlight the role of legitimacy, larger actors, and major cities in the spread of figurative norms and semiotic cultures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u6790\u5236\u56fe\u9057\u4ea7\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc777\u4e07\u6761\u5730\u56fe\u8bb0\u5f55\u548c\u8fd110\u4e07\u5f20\u6570\u5b57\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5730\u56fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6587\u5316\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u6f14\u53d8\u3001\u5730\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5730\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\u5f88\u5c11\u4ece\u5236\u56fe\u53f2\u548c\u6587\u5316\u89c6\u89d2\u7814\u7a76\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5730\u56fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53cd\u6620\u653f\u6cbb\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u671f\u671b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u6587\u5316\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c6\u6765\u81ea38\u4e2a\u6570\u5b57\u76ee\u5f55\u7684771,561\u6761\u5730\u56fe\u8bb0\u5f55\u548c99,715\u5f20\u6570\u5b57\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u6807\u51c6\u5316\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u571f\u5730\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u5236\u56fe\u7b26\u53f7\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8bc6\u522b\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5236\u56fe\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7126\u70b9\u4e0e\u653f\u6cbb\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5982\u5927\u897f\u6d0b\u6d77\u56fe\u7ed8\u5236\u3001\u4e09\u89d2\u8d38\u6613\u548c\u6b96\u6c11\u6269\u5f20\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff1b\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e86\u56fd\u5bb6\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\u548c\u519b\u4e8b\u51b2\u7a81\u5bf9\u51fa\u7248\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u4e8663M\u7b26\u53f7\u548c25M\u7247\u6bb5\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5236\u56fe\u7b26\u53f7\u5f62\u6210\u5c40\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5730\u56fe\u662f\u7ecf\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5176\u6784\u56fe\u548c\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c45\u4e2d\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u79f0\u5f3a\u8c03\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u5236\u56fe\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u6587\u5316\u4f20\u64ad\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u548c\u4e3b\u8981\u57ce\u5e02\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u6587\u5316\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Despite impressive performance, existing multi-agent systems inherently incur substantial token overhead and increased computational costs, posing challenges for large-scale deployment. To address these issues, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Multi-agent hierarchical communication graph PRUNING framework, termed M$^3$Prune. Our framework eliminates redundant edges across different modalities, achieving an optimal balance between task performance and token overhead. Specifically, M$^3$Prune first applies intra-modal graph sparsification to textual and visual modalities, identifying the edges most critical for solving the task. Subsequently, we construct a dynamic communication topology using these key edges for inter-modal graph sparsification. Finally, we progressively prune redundant edges to obtain a more efficient and hierarchical topology.

Recent studies have shown that grid-tagging methods are effective for information extraction due to their flexible tagging schemes and robust architectures. Building on this, we integrate image data augmentation techniques, such as cropping, scaling, and padding, into grid-based models to enhance their ability to recognize discontinuous entities and handle segmentation challenges. Experimental results demonstrate that traditional segmentation methods often fail to capture cross-sentence discontinuous entities, leading to decreased performance.

We formalize this tension as the Alignment Trilemma: no RLHF system can simultaneously achieve (i) epsilon-representativeness across diverse human values, (ii) polynomial tractability in sample and compute complexity, and (iii) delta-robustness against adversarial perturbations and distribution shift. Through a complexity-theoretic analysis integrating statistical learning theory and robust optimization, we prove that achieving both representativeness (epsilon <= 0.01) and robustness (delta <= 0.001) for global-scale populations requires Omega(2^{d_context}) operations, which is super-polynomial in the context dimensionality. We show that current RLHF implementations resolve this trilemma by sacrificing representativeness: they collect only 10^3--10^4 samples from homogeneous annotator pools while 10^7--10^8 samples are needed for true global representation.

Existing approaches to GS deformation typically rely on deformation proxies such as cages or meshes, but they suffer from dependency on proxy quality and additional computational overhead. An alternative is to directly apply Laplacian-based deformation techniques by treating splats as point clouds. However, this often fail to properly capture surface information due to lack of explicit structure. To address this, we propose a novel method that constructs a surface-aware splat graph, enabling the Laplacian operator derived from it to support more plausible deformations that preserve details and topology. Our key idea is to leverage the spatial arrangement encoded in splats, defining neighboring splats not merely by the distance between their centers, but by their intersections. Furthermore, we introduce a Gaussian kernel adaptation technique that preserves surface structure under deformation, thereby improving rendering quality after deformation. In our experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to both proxy-based and proxy-free baselines, evaluated on 50 challenging objects from the ShapeNet, Objaverse, and Sketchfab datasets, as well as the NeRF-Synthetic dataset.

We revisit this bottleneck through the lens of speculation. While traditional predict-verify speculation paradigm can break serial execution, its benefit remains limited, as it retains the full original workload and adds extra inference overhead. We observe that early agent steps often involve simple evidence-gathering, where correct actions can often be predicted without full reasoning. Building on these observations, we present SPAgent, an algorithm-system co-design framework that expands the role of speculation in search agents to reduce latency. Algorithmically, SPAgent introduces a two-phase adaptive speculation mechanism that selectively omits verification when safe. System-wise, a two-level scheduler regulates speculative requests based on engine load to ensure speculation remains beneficial. We implement SPAgent in real-world systems.

A simplified, machine-actionable representation was developed to assess the similarity and separability of these disorders, but it is not suited for the most complex cases. Generating or applying a full binary matrix for similarity calculations is infeasible due to the vast number of symptom combinations. This research develops an alternative representation that links the narrative form of the DSM-5 with the binary matrix representation and enables automated generation of valid symptom combinations. Using a strict pre-defined format of lists, sets, and numbers with slight variations, complex diagnostic pathways involving numerous symptom combinations can be represented. This format, called the symptom profile generator (or simply generator), provides a readable, adaptable, and comprehensive alternative to a binary matrix while enabling easy generation of symptom combinations (profiles). Cognitive disorders, which typically involve multiple diagnostic criteria with several symptoms, can thus be expressed as lists of generators. Representing several psychotic disorders in generator form and generating all symptom combinations showed that matrix representations of complex disorders become too large to manage. The MPCS (maximum pairwise cosine similarity) algorithm cannot handle matrices of this size, prompting the development of a profile reduction method using targeted generator manipulation to find specific MPCS values between disorders. The generators allow easier creation of binary representations for large matrices and make it possible to calculate specific MPCS cases between complex disorders through conditional generators.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u75c7\u72b6\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8868\u793aDSM-5\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u8ba4\u77e5\u969c\u788d\u7684\u75c7\u72b6\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u77e9\u9635\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "DSM-5\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u8ba4\u77e5\u969c\u788d\u7684\u75c7\u72b6\u7ec4\u5408\u6570\u91cf\u5e9e\u5927\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u77e9\u9635\u8fdb\u884c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5217\u8868\u3001\u96c6\u5408\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u683c\u5f0f\u521b\u5efa\u75c7\u72b6\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u7684\u75c7\u72b6\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5668\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u7f29\u51cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u591a\u79cd\u7cbe\u795e\u969c\u788d\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6240\u6709\u75c7\u72b6\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u590d\u6742\u969c\u788d\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u8868\u793a\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5e9e\u5927\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u75c7\u72b6\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u8bfb\u3001\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u4e14\u5168\u9762\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u77e9\u9635\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u80fd\u591f\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u969c\u788d\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7279\u5b9aMPCS\u503c\u3002"}}

Recent AI-based frameworks have been developed to analyze large volumes of aerial imagery collected by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, providing actionable insights rapidly. However, creating and annotating data for training these models is costly and time-consuming, resulting in datasets that are limited in size and diversity. Furthermore, most existing approaches rely on traditional classification-based frameworks with fixed answer spaces, restricting their ability to provide new information without additional data collection or model retraining. Using pre-trained generative models built on in-context learning (ICL) allows for flexible and open-ended answer spaces. However, these models often generate hallucinated outputs or produce generic responses that lack domain-specific relevance. To address these limitations, we propose ThiFAN-VQA, a two-stage reasoning-based framework for visual question answering (VQA) in disaster scenarios. ThiFAN-VQA first generates structured reasoning traces using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and ICL to enable interpretable reasoning under limited supervision.

However, existing large language model-based (LLM-based) approaches often rely heavily on external knowledge sources, introducing substantial latency and even hallucinations that undermine reliability, interpretability, and responsiveness, which is crucial for real-time use. To address these challenges, we propose REason-guided Fact-checking with Latent EXplanations REFLEX paradigm, a plug-and-play, self-refining paradigm that leverages the internal knowledge in backbone model to improve both verdict accuracy and explanation quality. REFLEX reformulates fact-checking as a role-play dialogue and jointly trains verdict prediction and explanation generation. It adaptively extracts contrastive activation pairs between the backbone model and its fine-tuned variant to construct steering vectors that disentangle truth into style and substance naturally. These activation-level signals guide inference and suppress noisy explanations, enabling more faithful and efficient reasoning. Experiments on real-world datasets show that REFLEX outperforms previous methods that steer toward a single truth direction and underscores the challenge traditional approaches face when handling the subtle, human-unknown truth in fact-checking tasks. Remarkably, with only 465 self-refined training samples, RELFEX achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, models trained with explanatory objectives can effectively guide those without them, yielding up to a 7.57% improvement, highlighting that internal explanation signals play a dual role in both interpreting and enhancing factual reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "REFLEX\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u88c1\u51b3\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700465\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u5c31\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u6e90\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faREFLEX\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u88c1\u51b3\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u751f\u6210\u3002\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u53d6\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5176\u5fae\u8c03\u53d8\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5bf9\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5c06\u771f\u76f8\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u5b9e\u8d28\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7ea7\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cREFLEX\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528465\u4e2a\u81ea\u7cbe\u70bc\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u5c31\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5e26\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6307\u5bfc\u65e0\u89e3\u91ca\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe7.57%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5185\u90e8\u89e3\u91ca\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u65e2\u5177\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u4f5c\u7528\u53c8\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0cREFLEX\u8303\u5f0f\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5fe0\u5b9e\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Despite this, existing approaches frequently perform naive fusion of multimodal inputs, overlooking key challenges such as modality-specific noise, missing modalities common in real-world scenarios, and the dynamically varying importance of each modality depending on the task. These limitations lead to suboptimal performance across several benchmark tasks. In this paper, we propose a robust multimodal fusion framework, TouchFormer. Specifically, we employ a Modality-Adaptive Gating (MAG) mechanism and intra- and inter-modality attention mechanisms to adaptively integrate cross-modal features, enhancing model robustness. Additionally, we introduce a Cross-Instance Embedding Regularization(CER) strategy, which significantly improves classification accuracy in fine-grained subcategory material recognition tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing non-visual methods, the proposed TouchFormer framework achieves classification accuracy improvements of 2.48% and 6.83% on SSMC and USMC tasks, respectively. Furthermore, real-world robotic experiments validate TouchFormer's effectiveness in enabling robots to better perceive and interpret their environment, paving the way for its deployment in safety-critical applications such as emergency response and industrial automation.

The architecture comprises a Native Vision Transformer (ViT) and a lightweight LLM connected via an MLP adapter. HunyuanOCR demonstrates superior performance, outperforming commercial APIs, traditional pipelines, and larger models (e.g., Qwen3-VL-4B). Specifically, it surpasses current public solutions in perception tasks (Text Spotting, Parsing) and excels in semantic tasks (IE, Text Image Translation), securing first place in the ICDAR 2025 DIMT Challenge (Small Model Track). Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on OCRBench among VLMs with fewer than 3B parameters.\n  HunyuanOCR achieves breakthroughs in three key aspects: 1) Unifying Versatility and Efficiency: We implement comprehensive support for core capabilities including spotting, parsing, IE, VQA, and translation within a lightweight framework. This addresses the limitations of narrow \"OCR expert models\" and inefficient \"General VLMs\". 2) Streamlined End-to-End Architecture: Adopting a pure end-to-end paradigm eliminates dependencies on pre-processing modules (e.g., layout analysis). This fundamentally resolves error propagation common in traditional pipelines and simplifies system deployment. 3) Data-Driven and RL Strategies: We confirm the critical role of high-quality data and, for the first time in the industry, demonstrate that Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategies yield significant performance gains in OCR tasks.\n  HunyuanOCR is officially open-sourced on HuggingFace. We also provide a high-performance deployment solution based on vLLM, placing its production efficiency in the top tier.

Current speculative decoding methods typically assume a considerable amount of available computing power, then generate a complex and massive draft tree using a small autoregressive language model to improve overall prediction accuracy. However, methods like batching have been widely applied in mainstream model inference systems as a superior alternative to speculative decoding, as they compress the available idle computing power. Therefore, performing speculative decoding with low verification resources and low scheduling costs has become an important research problem. We believe that more capable models that allow for parallel generation on draft sequences are what we truly need. Recognizing the fundamental nature of draft models to only generate sequences of limited length, we propose SpecFormer, a novel architecture that integrates unidirectional and bidirectional attention mechanisms. SpecFormer combines the autoregressive model's ability to extract information from the entire input sequence with the parallel generation benefits of non-autoregressive models. This design eliminates the reliance on large prefix trees and achieves consistent acceleration, even in large-batch scenarios. Through lossless speculative decoding experiments across models of various scales, we demonstrate that SpecFormer sets a new standard for scaling LLM inference with lower training demands and reduced computational costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "SpecFormer\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5355\u5411\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0LLM\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u578b\u524d\u7f00\u6811\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u53ef\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6279\u5904\u7406\u7b49\u4e3b\u6d41\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u7a7a\u95f2\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u88ab\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4f4e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u4f4e\u8c03\u5ea6\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSpecFormer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5355\u5411\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u6574\u4e2a\u8f93\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u63d0\u53d6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u975e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cSpecFormer\u4e3aLLM\u63a8\u7406\u6269\u5c55\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u65b0\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "SpecFormer\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u524d\u7f00\u6811\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u6279\u91cf\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Although prior work shows that both strategies yield the same expected descent direction for the global loss, it remains unclear whether the Euclidean-space guarantees are tight and what fundamentally differentiates their behaviors. To clarify this, we develop a weighted Hilbert-space framework $L^2(\u03bb;\\mathbb{R}^d)$ and obtain convergence rates that are strictly tighter than those from Euclidean analysis. In this geometry, the row-stochastic matrix becomes self-adjoint whereas the doubly stochastic one does not, creating additional penalty terms that amplify consensus error, thereby slowing convergence. Consequently, the difference in convergence arises not only from spectral gaps but also from these penalty terms. We then derive sufficient conditions under which the row-stochastic design converges faster even with a smaller spectral gap. Finally, by using a Rayleigh-quotient and Loewner-order eigenvalue comparison, we further obtain topology conditions that guarantee this advantage and yield practical topology-design guidelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6743\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4e24\u79cd\u6743\u91cd\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u884c\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5373\u4f7f\u8c31\u95f4\u9699\u66f4\u5c0f\u4e5f\u80fd\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u8282\u70b9\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u81ea\u7136\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u5c40\u90e8\u635f\u5931\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u5747\u5300\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u6216\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u635f\u5931\u4f46\u4f7f\u7528\u03bb\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u884c\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u3002\u867d\u7136\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u671f\u671b\u4e0b\u964d\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5dee\u5f02\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u52a0\u6743\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u6846\u67b6L\u00b2(\u03bb;\u211d\u1d48)\uff0c\u5728\u6b64\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u5206\u6790\u884c\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u53cc\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u745e\u5229\u5546\u548cLoewner\u5e8f\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u6bd4\u8f83\u63a8\u5bfc\u6536\u655b\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u4e2d\uff0c\u884c\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u6210\u4e3a\u81ea\u4f34\u7b97\u5b50\u800c\u53cc\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u4e0d\u662f\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u989d\u5916\u7684\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\u653e\u5927\u5171\u8bc6\u8bef\u5dee\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u6162\u6536\u655b\u3002\u6536\u655b\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6765\u81ea\u8c31\u95f4\u9699\uff0c\u8fd8\u6765\u81ea\u8fd9\u4e9b\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\u3002", "conclusion": "\u884c\u968f\u673a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5373\u4f7f\u8c31\u95f4\u9699\u66f4\u5c0f\u4e5f\u80fd\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62d3\u6251\u6761\u4ef6\u53ef\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8fd9\u79cd\u4f18\u52bf\u5e76\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u62d3\u6251\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) serves as the frontline imaging tool, yet it often fails to reveal the subtle ischemic changes present in the early, hyperacute phase. This limitation can delay crucial interventions. To address this diagnostic challenge, we introduce a semi-supervised segmentation method using generative adversarial networks (GANs) to accurately delineate early ischemic stroke regions. The proposed method employs an adversarial framework to effectively learn from a limited number of annotated NCCT scans, while simultaneously leveraging a larger pool of unlabeled scans. By employing Dice loss, cross-entropy loss, a feature matching loss and a self-training loss, the model learns to identify and delineate early infarcts, even when they are faint or their size is small. Experiments on the publicly available Acute Ischemic Stroke Dataset (AISD) demonstrate the potential of the proposed method to enhance diagnostic capabilities, reduce the burden of manual annotation, and support more efficient clinical decision-making in stroke care.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GANs\uff09\u7684\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u975e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u589e\u5f3aCT\u626b\u63cf\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u63cf\u7ed8\u65e9\u671f\u7f3a\u8840\u6027\u5352\u4e2d\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u65e9\u671f\u7f3a\u8840\u53d8\u5316\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f3a\u8840\u6027\u5352\u4e2d\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65f6\u95f4\u7d27\u8feb\u7684\u533b\u7597\u6025\u75c7\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u8bca\u65ad\u5bf9\u6539\u5584\u60a3\u8005\u9884\u540e\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u975e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u589e\u5f3aCT\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u7ebf\u6210\u50cf\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u8d85\u6025\u6027\u671f\u5f80\u5f80\u65e0\u6cd5\u663e\u793a\u7ec6\u5fae\u7684\u7f3a\u8840\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5173\u952e\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GANs\uff09\u7684\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u6846\u67b6\u4ece\u6709\u9650\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u6807\u6ce8NCCT\u626b\u63cf\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u5927\u91cf\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u626b\u63cf\u3002\u4f7f\u7528Dice\u635f\u5931\u3001\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u5339\u914d\u635f\u5931\u548c\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u63cf\u7ed8\u65e9\u671f\u6897\u6b7b\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u6025\u6027\u7f3a\u8840\u6027\u5352\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08AISD\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\u8bca\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5352\u4e2d\u62a4\u7406\u4e2d\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u63cf\u7ed8\u65e9\u671f\u7f3a\u8840\u6027\u5352\u4e2d\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u75c5\u7076\u5fae\u5f31\u6216\u5c3a\u5bf8\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e3a\u5352\u4e2d\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While prior work has shown that LLMs can represent task patterns and surface-level concepts, it remains unclear whether these models can encode high-level relational concepts and apply them to novel situations through structured comparisons. In this work, we explore this fundamental aspect using proportional and story analogies, and identify three key findings. First, LLMs effectively encode the underlying relationships between analogous entities; both attributive and relational information propagate through mid-upper layers in correct cases, whereas reasoning failures reflect missing relational information within these layers. Second, unlike humans, LLMs often struggle not only when relational information is missing, but also when attempting to apply it to new entities. In such cases, strategically patching hidden representations at critical token positions can facilitate information transfer to a certain extent. Lastly, successful analogical reasoning in LLMs is marked by strong structural alignment between analogous situations, whereas failures often reflect degraded or misplaced alignment.

Progress in defending against these attacks is hindered by a reliance on manual, hard-to-scale dataset creation. This paper introduces a novel, automated pipeline for generating large-scale, psychologically-grounded multi-turn jailbreak datasets. We systematically operationalize FITD techniques into reproducible templates, creating a benchmark of 1,500 scenarios across illegal activities and offensive content. We evaluate seven models from three major LLM families under both multi-turn (with history) and single-turn (without history) conditions. Our results reveal stark differences in contextual robustness: models in the GPT family demonstrate a significant vulnerability to conversational history, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) increasing by as much as 32 percentage points. In contrast, Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash exhibits exceptional resilience, proving nearly immune to these attacks, while Anthropic's Claude 3 Haiku shows strong but imperfect resistance.

Imaging Systems and Techniques (IST 2025), Strasburg, France", "summary": "Gastrointestinal (GI) imaging via Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) generates a large number of images requiring manual screening. Deep learning-based Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems can assist screening, yet their performance relies on the existence of large, diverse, training medical datasets. However, the scarcity of such data, due to privacy constraints and annotation costs, hinders CDS development. Generative machine learning offers a viable solution to combat this limitation. While current Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) methods, such as Generative Adversarial Networks and Variational Autoencoders have been explored, they often face challenges with training stability and capturing sufficient visual diversity, especially when synthesizing abnormal findings. This work introduces a novel VAE-based methodology for medical image synthesis and presents its application for the generation of WCE images. The novel contributions of this work include a) multiscale extension of the Vector Quantized VAE model, named as Multiscale Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MSVQ-VAE); b) unlike other VAE-based SDG models for WCE image generation, MSVQ-VAE is used to seamlessly introduce abnormalities into normal WCE images; c) it enables conditional generation of synthetic images, enabling the introduction of different types of abnormalities into the normal WCE images; d) it performs experiments with a variety of abnormality types, including polyps, vascular and inflammatory conditions. The utility of the generated images for CDS is assessed via image classification. Comparative experiments demonstrate that training a CDS classifier using the abnormal images generated by the proposed methodology yield comparable results with a classifier trained with only real data.

To address this, we propose the Sculpted Memory Forgetting Adapter (SMFA), which confines forgetting to targeted memory regions while preserving overall capabilities. SMFA first fine-tunes the model to replace sensitive responses with refusals, yielding a memory forgetting adapter, and then applies a retaining anchor-guided masking mechanism to prevent interference with unrelated knowledge and understanding ability. To systematically evaluate selective MLLM unlearning, we introduce S-MLLMUn Bench, the first benchmark designed to jointly assess the removal of sensitive knowledge and retention of general visual understanding.

A dominant line of work seeks robustness by learning a robust representation, often explicitly partitioning the latent space into core and spurious components; this approach can be complex, brittle, and difficult to scale. We take a different approach, instead of a robust representation, we learn a robust function. We present a simple and effective training method that renders the classifier functionally invariant to shortcut signals. Our method operates within a disentangled latent space, which is essential as it isolates spurious and core features into distinct dimensions. This separation enables the identification of candidate shortcut features by their strong correlation with the label, used as a proxy for semantic simplicity. The classifier is then desensitized to these features by injecting targeted, anisotropic latent noise during training. We analyze this as targeted Jacobian regularization, which forces the classifier to ignore spurious features and rely on more complex, core semantic signals.

Our two-stage framework first learns to jointly model gaze and egocentric video when predicting skill level, then distills a gaze-only student model. At inference, the student model requires only gaze input, drastically reducing power consumption by eliminating continuous video processing. Experiments on three datasets spanning cooking, music, and sports establish, for the first time, the valuable role of gaze in skill understanding across diverse real-world settings.

However, evaluating stemming methods is challenging because current evaluation approaches are limited and do not capture the potential harm caused by excessive stemming; therefore, it is essential to develop new approaches to evaluate stemming methods. To address this issue, this study propose a novel, task-oriented approach to evaluate stemming methods, which considers three aspects: (1) the utility of stemming using Stemming Effectiveness Score (SES), (2) the impact of stemming on downstream tasks using Model Performance Delta (MPD), and (3) the semantic similarity between stemmed and original words using Average Normalized Levenshtein Distance (ANLD), thus providing a comprehensive evaluation framework. We apply our evaluation framework to compare two stemmers for Bangla (BNLTK) and English (Snowball), and our results reveal a significant issue, prompting us to analyze their performance in detail. While the Bangla stemmer achieves the highest SES (1.67) due to effective word reduction (CR = 1.90), SES alone is insufficient because our proposed safety measure, ANLD, reveals that this high SES is due to harmful over-stemming (ANLD = 0.26), which correlates with the observed decrease in downstream performance.In contrast, the English stemmer achieves a moderate SES (1.31) with a safe meaning distance (ANLD = 0.14), allowing its word reduction to contribute positively to downstream performance; therefore, it is a more reliable stemmer. Our study provides a valuable tool for distinguishing between potential efficiency gains (high SES) and meaning preservation (low ANLD).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u9762\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542bSES\u3001MPD\u548cANLD\u4e09\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u548c\u82f1\u8bed\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56SES\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5371\u5bb3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5206\u6570(SES)\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u6548\u7528\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02(MPD)\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b3) \u4f7f\u7528\u5e73\u5747\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7f16\u8f91\u8ddd\u79bb(ANLD)\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bcd\u5e72\u5316\u8bcd\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u8bcd\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u9ad8SES(1.67)\u4f46ANLD\u663e\u793a\u5b58\u5728\u6709\u5bb3\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6(ANLD=0.26)\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u82f1\u8bed\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u83b7\u5f97\u4e2d\u7b49SES(1.31)\u4f46\u8bed\u4e49\u8ddd\u79bb\u5b89\u5168(ANLD=0.14)\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u79ef\u6781\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u533a\u5206\u6f5c\u5728\u6548\u7387\u589e\u76ca(\u9ad8SES)\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301(\u4f4eANLD)\u7684\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56SES\u4e0d\u8db3\u591f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

Methods: We proposed a semantic distribution-guided reconstruction framework that uses a pre-trained vision-language foundation model to encode both the reconstructed image and auxiliary information into high-level semantic features. A contrastive objective aligns the reconstructed representation with the target semantic distribution, ensuring consistency with high-level perceptual cues. The proposed objective works with various deep learning-based reconstruction methods and can flexibly incorporate semantic priors from multimodal sources. To test the effectiveness of these semantic priors, we evaluated reconstruction results guided by priors derived from either image-only or image-language auxiliary information. Results: Experiments on knee and brain datasets demonstrate that semantic priors from images preserve fine anatomical structures and achieve superior perceptual quality, as reflected in lower LPIPS values, higher Tenengrad scores, and improved scores in the reader study, compared with conventional regularization. The image-language information further expands the semantic distribution and enables high-level control over reconstruction attributes. Across all evaluations, the contrastive objective consistently guided the reconstructed features toward the desired semantic distributions while maintaining data fidelity, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed optimization framework.

CostNav models the complete economic lifecycle including hardware, training, energy, maintenance costs, and delivery revenue with service-level agreements, using industry-derived parameters. \\textbf{To our knowledge, CostNav is the first work to quantitatively expose the gap between navigation research metrics and commercial viability}, revealing that optimizing for task success fundamentally differs from optimizing for economic deployment. Our cost model uses parameters derived from industry data sources (energy rates, delivery service pricing), and we project from a reduced-scale simulation to realistic deliveries.

Two challenges, however, remain central: training generative models when no paired data exist, and evaluating stylistic text without relying only on human judgment. In this work, we present a framework for both generating and evaluating sentences in the style of 19th-century novelists. Large language models are fine-tuned with minimal, single-token prompts to produce text in the voices of authors such as Dickens, Austen, Twain, Alcott, and Melville. To assess these generative models, we employ a transformer-based detector trained on authentic sentences, using it both as a classifier and as a tool for stylistic explanation. We complement this with syntactic comparisons and explainable AI methods, including attention-based and gradient-based analyses, to identify the linguistic cues that drive stylistic imitation.

A Critical Framework for Policy Uses of Neuroeconomics", "comment": "Durham Economic Journal 2025", "summary": "Neuroeconomics promises to ground welfare analysis in neural and computational evidence about how people value outcomes, learn from experience and exercise self-control. At the same time, policy and commercial actors increasingly invoke neural data to justify paternalistic regulation, \"brain-based\" interventions and new welfare measures. This paper asks under what conditions neural data can legitimately inform welfare judgements for policy rather than merely describing behaviour. I develop a non-empirical, model-based framework that links three levels: neural signals, computational decision models and normative welfare criteria. Within an actor-critic reinforcement-learning model, I formalise the inference path from neural activity to latent values and prediction errors and then to welfare claims. I show that neural evidence constrains welfare judgements only when the neural-computational mapping is well validated, the decision model identifies \"true\" interests versus context-dependent mistakes, and the welfare criterion is explicitly specified and defended. Applying the framework to addiction, neuromarketing and environmental policy, I derive a Neuroeconomic Welfare Inference Checklist for regulators and for designers of NeuroAI systems. The analysis treats brains and artificial agents as value-learning systems while showing that internal reward signals, whether biological or artificial, are computational quantities and cannot be treated as welfare measures without an explicit normative model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u798f\u5229\u63a8\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u795e\u7ecf\u6570\u636e\u5728\u4f55\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5408\u6cd5\u5730\u7528\u4e8e\u653f\u7b56\u798f\u5229\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u63cf\u8ff0\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u795e\u7ecf\u6570\u636e\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u88ab\u653f\u7b56\u548c\u5546\u4e1a\u884c\u4e3a\u8005\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc1\u660e\u5bb6\u957f\u5f0f\u76d1\u7ba1\u3001\"\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8111\"\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u548c\u65b0\u798f\u5229\u63aa\u65bd\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u660e\u786e\u795e\u7ecf\u6570\u636e\u5728\u798f\u5229\u5224\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u5408\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027\u7684\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u51b3\u7b56\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u798f\u5229\u6807\u51c6\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528actor-critic\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4ece\u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\u5230\u6f5c\u5728\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u518d\u5230\u798f\u5229\u4e3b\u5f20\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u53ea\u6709\u5f53\u795e\u7ecf-\u8ba1\u7b97\u6620\u5c04\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\"\u771f\u5b9e\"\u5229\u76ca\u4e0e\u60c5\u5883\u4f9d\u8d56\u9519\u8bef\u3001\u798f\u5229\u6807\u51c6\u88ab\u660e\u786e\u6307\u5b9a\u548c\u8fa9\u62a4\u65f6\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u8bc1\u636e\u624d\u80fd\u7ea6\u675f\u798f\u5229\u5224\u65ad\u3002\u5e94\u7528\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e8e\u6210\u763e\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u8425\u9500\u548c\u73af\u5883\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u5236\u5b9a\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u798f\u5229\u63a8\u65ad\u6e05\u5355\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8111\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u4ee3\u7406\u90fd\u5e94\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u4ef7\u503c\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u751f\u7269\u8fd8\u662f\u4eba\u5de5\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u90fd\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u786e\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u5c31\u4e0d\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u798f\u5229\u8861\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

However, prior studies have used either low-resolution thumbnails or random patches, which likely underestimated model performance. Here, we ask whether LMMs can be adapted to reason coherently and accurately in the evaluation of such images. In this study, we introduce Gigapixel Image Agent for Navigating Tissue (GIANT), the first framework that allows LMMs to iteratively navigate whole-slide images (WSIs) like a pathologist. Accompanying GIANT, we release MultiPathQA, a new benchmark, which comprises 934 WSI-level questions, encompassing five clinically-relevant tasks ranging from cancer diagnosis to open-ended reasoning. MultiPathQA also includes 128 questions, authored by two professional pathologists, requiring direct slide interpretation. Using MultiPathQA, we show that our simple agentic system substantially outperforms conventional patch- and thumbnail-based baselines, approaching or surpassing the performance of specialized models trained on millions of images. For example, on pathologist-authored questions, GPT-5 with GIANT achieves 62.5% accuracy, outperforming specialist pathology models such as TITAN (43.8%) and SlideChat (37.5%).

Motivated by cybersecurity applications in the email marketing domain, we propose a method for generating Diverse, Actionable, and kNowledge-Constrained Explanations (DANCE), which incorporates feature dependencies and causal constraints to ensure plausibility and real-world feasibility of counterfactuals. Our method learns linear and nonlinear constraints from data or integrates expert-provided dependency graphs, ensuring counterfactuals are plausible and actionable. By maintaining consistency with feature relationships, the method produces explanations that align with real-world constraints. Additionally, it balances plausibility, diversity, and sparsity, effectively addressing key limitations in existing algorithms. The work is developed based on a real-life case study with Freshmail, the largest email marketing company in Poland and supported by a joint R&D project Sendguard. Furthermore, we provide an extensive evaluation using 140 public datasets, which highlights its ability to generate meaningful, domain-relevant counterfactuals that outperform other existing approaches based on widely used metrics.

However, we show that high final-answer accuracy often hides unfaithful visual reasoning: models may invoke tools on irrelevant regions or ignore tool outputs entirely, yet still guess the correct answer. In this work, we first propose a faithfulness evaluation protocol that measures whether intermediate visual tool outputs (e.g., crops) actually contain the queried evidence. This reveals that recent visual agents achieve high final-answer accuracy but exhibit low rates of faithful tool-use on visual search benchmarks. We then introduce CodeV, a code-based visual agent trained with Tool-Aware Policy Optimization (TAPO). TAPO is a process-level RL framework that augments GRPO with dense rewards defined directly on visual tool inputs and outputs, rather than on chain-of-thought tokens, making supervision easier to verify and less susceptible to reward hacking. CodeV represents visual tools as executable Python code, and TAPO assigns step-wise rewards based solely on the question and tool output, encouraging both necessary and evidence-consistent tool use. In a two-stage SFT+RL pipeline, CodeV achieves competitive or superior accuracy while substantially increasing faithful tool-use rates on related visual search benchmarks. Beyond visual search, CodeV attains strong performance on a range of multimodal reasoning and math benchmarks, suggesting that explicitly supervising intermediate tool behavior is crucial for building trustworthy, agentic visual reasoning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCodeV\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548cTAPO\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ea7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u76d1\u7763\u4e2d\u95f4\u89c6\u89c9\u5de5\u5177\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8c03\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u64cd\u4f5c\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u2014\u2014\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u65e0\u5173\u533a\u57df\u8c03\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u6216\u5ffd\u7565\u5de5\u5177\u8f93\u51fa\u5374\u4ecd\u80fd\u731c\u5bf9\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCodeV\u4ee3\u7801\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Tool-Aware Policy Optimization (TAPO)\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728GRPO\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u589e\u52a0\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u5de5\u5177\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u5de5\u5177\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884cPython\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u914d\u9010\u6b65\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "result": "CodeV\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u641c\u7d22\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "\u660e\u786e\u76d1\u7763\u4e2d\u95f4\u5de5\u5177\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u7684\u3001\u5177\u5907\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in schema matching, they suffer from hallucination and lack of up-to-date domain knowledge. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a solution by providing structured, verifiable knowledge. However, existing KG-augmented LLM approaches often rely on inefficient complex multi-hop queries or storage-intensive vector-based retrieval methods. This paper introduces SMoG (Schema Matching on Graph), a novel framework that leverages iterative execution of simple 1-hop SPARQL queries, inspired by successful strategies in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). SMoG enhances explainability and reliability by generating human-verifiable query paths while significantly reducing storage requirements by directly querying SPARQL endpoints. Experimental results on real-world medical datasets demonstrate that SMoG achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness and efficiency in KG-augmented schema matching.", "AI": {"tldr": "SMoG\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u533b\u7597\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u6267\u884c\u7b80\u5355\u76841\u8df3SPARQL\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u5728\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u591a\u8df3\u67e5\u8be2\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6210\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u9f50\u5230\u6807\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982OMOP CDM\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc7\u65f6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u65b9\u6cd5\u53c8\u9762\u4e34\u591a\u8df3\u67e5\u8be2\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u9700\u6c42\u5927\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSMoG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8fed\u4ee3\u6267\u884c\u7b80\u53551\u8df3SPARQL\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53d7\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u95ee\u7b54\u6210\u529f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u67e5\u8be2SPARQL\u7aef\u70b9\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSMoG\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "SMoG\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u76841\u8df3\u67e5\u8be2\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5b58\u50a8\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing approaches predominantly rely on parameter interpolation in weight space, which we show introduces significant distribution shift in the feature space and undermines task-specific knowledge. In this paper, we propose OTMF (Optimal Transport-based Masked Fusion), a novel model merging framework rooted in optimal transport theory to address the distribution shift that arises from naive parameter interpolation. Instead of directly aggregating features or weights, OTMF aligns the semantic geometry of task-specific models by discovering common masks applied to task vectors through optimal transport plans. These masks selectively extract transferable and task-agnostic components while preserving the unique structural identities of each task. To ensure scalability in real-world settings, OTMF further supports a continual fusion paradigm that incrementally integrates each new task vector without revisiting previous ones, maintaining a bounded memory footprint and enabling efficient fusion across a growing number of tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple vision and language benchmarks, and results show that OTMF achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

In addition, the resulting agent policies are difficult to interpret, adapt, or incrementally improve. To address this, we investigate creating and refining structured memory of experiential learning of an agent from its environment as an alternative route to agent optimization. We introduce BREW (Bootstrapping expeRientially-learned Environmental knoWledge), a framework for agent optimization for downstream tasks via KB construction and refinement. In our formulation, we introduce an effective method for partitioning agent memory for more efficient retrieval and refinement. BREW uses task graders and behavior rubrics to learn insights while leveraging state-space search for ensuring robustness from the noise and non-specificity in natural language. Empirical results on real world, domain-grounded benchmarks -- OSWorld, $\u03c4^2$Bench, and SpreadsheetBench -- show BREW achieves $10-20\\%$ improvement in task precision, $10-15\\%$ reduction in API/tool calls leading to faster execution time, all while maintaining computational efficiency on par with base models. Unlike prior work where memory is treated as static context, we establish the KB as a modular and controllable substrate for agent optimization -- an explicit lever for shaping behavior in a transparent, interpretable, and extensible manner.", "AI": {"tldr": "BREW\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u7cbe\u70bc\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5b66\u4e60\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u6765\u4f18\u5316LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11API\u8c03\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8ePPO\u548cGRPO\u7b49\u6743\u91cd\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u4e14\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6216\u589e\u91cf\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165BREW\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u7cbe\u70bc\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u533a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u5206\u5668\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u51c6\u5219\u5b66\u4e60\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u641c\u7d22\u786e\u4fdd\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728OSWorld\u3001\u03c4\u00b2Bench\u548cSpreadsheetBench\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cBREW\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8610-20%\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c10-15%\u7684API/\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "BREW\u5c06\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u786e\u7acb\u4e3a\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4ee5\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5851\u9020\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

Our code is available at https://github.com/DhruvaKashyap/modhifi", "summary": "Open weight models, which are ubiquitous, rarely provide access to their training data or loss function. This makes modifying such models for tasks such as pruning or unlearning constrained by this unavailability an active area of research. Existing techniques typically require gradients or ground-truth labels, rendering them infeasible in settings with limited computational resources. In this work, we investigate the fundamental question of identifying components that are critical to the model's predictive performance, without access to either gradients or the loss function, and with only distributional access such as synthetic data. We theoretically demonstrate that the global reconstruction error is linearly bounded by local reconstruction errors for Lipschitz-continuous networks such as CNNs and well-trained Transformers (which, contrary to existing literature, we find exhibit Lipschitz continuity). This motivates using the locally reconstructive behavior of component subsets to quantify their global importance, via a metric that we term Subset Fidelity. In the uncorrelated features setting, selecting individual components via their Subset Fidelity scores is optimal, which we use to propose ModHiFi, an algorithm for model modification that requires no training data or loss function access. ModHiFi-P, for structured pruning, achieves an 11% speedup over the current state of the art on ImageNet models and competitive performance on language models.

In a teacher-student setup, this translates into collecting a dataset of the teacher mapping -- querying the teacher -- and fitting a student to imitate such mapping. A sensible choice of queries is the dataset the teacher is trained on. But current methods fail when the teacher parameters are more numerous than the training data, because the student overfits to the queries instead of aligning its parameters to the teacher. In this work, we explore augmentation techniques to best sample the input-output mapping of a teacher network, with the goal of eliciting a rich set of representations from the teacher hidden layers. We discover that standard augmentations such as rotation, flipping, and adding noise, bring little to no improvement to the identification problem.

The manual analysis of student conversations to identify these discourse features is time-consuming and labor-intensive, which limits the scale and scope of studies. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques can facilitate the automatic detection of these discourse features, offering educational researchers scalable and data-driven insights. However, existing studies in NLP that focus on discourse in dialogue rarely address educational data. In this work, we address this gap by introducing an annotated educational dialogue dataset of student conversations featuring knowledge construction and task production discourse. We also establish baseline models for automatically predicting these discourse properties for each turn of talk within conversations, using pre-trained large language models GPT-3.5 and Llama-3.1.

We recast LMI as reusing the LLM's own latent space and propose the Invariant Latent Space Hypothesis (ILSH): (1) diverse outputs from the same source prompt should preserve consistent semantics (source invariance), and (2) input<->output cyclic mappings should be self-consistent within a shared latent space (cyclic invariance). Accordingly, we present Inv^2A, which treats the LLM as an invariant decoder and learns only a lightweight inverse encoder that maps outputs to a denoised pseudo-representation. When multiple outputs are available, they are sparsely concatenated at the representation layer to increase information density. Training proceeds in two stages: contrastive alignment (source invariance) and supervised reinforcement (cyclic invariance). An optional training-free neighborhood search can refine local performance. Across 9 datasets covering user and system prompt scenarios, Inv^2A outperforms baselines by an average of 4.77% BLEU score while reducing dependence on large inverse corpora.

Evaluating large language models' (LLMs) alignment typically involves directly assessing their open-ended responses, requiring human annotators or strong LLM judges. Conversely, LLMs themselves have also been extensively evaluated as judges for assessing alignment. In this work, we examine the relationship between LLMs' generation and evaluation capabilities in aligning with human preferences. To this end, we first conduct a comprehensive analysis of the generation-evaluation consistency (GE-consistency) among various LLMs, revealing a strong correlation between their generation and evaluation capabilities when evaluated by a strong LLM preference oracle. Utilizing this finding, we propose a benchmarking paradigm that measures LLM alignment with human preferences without directly evaluating their generated outputs, instead assessing LLMs in their role as evaluators. Our evaluation shows that our proposed benchmark, AlignEval, matches or surpasses widely used automatic LLM evaluation benchmarks, such as AlpacaEval and Arena-Hard, in capturing human preferences when ranking LLMs. Our study offers valuable insights into the connection between LLMs' generation and evaluation capabilities, and introduces a benchmark that assesses alignment without directly evaluating model outputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAlignEval\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u95f4\u63a5\u8861\u91cf\u5176\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u7684\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u5728\u6392\u540dLLM\u65b9\u9762\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5f00\u653e\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8fd9\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u5f3aLLM\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22LLM\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5206\u6790\u5404\u79cdLLM\u7684\u751f\u6210-\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e00\u81f4\u6027(GE-consistency)\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u8005\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51faAlignEval\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u95f4\u63a5\u8861\u91cf\u5176\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "AlignEval\u57fa\u51c6\u5728\u6355\u83b7\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u6392\u540dLLM\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4e0eAlpacaEval\u548cArena-Hard\u7b49\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u7684\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0cAlignEval\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3LLM\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Once trained, they offer fast inference and reasonably high-quality solutions for in-distribution testing instances, but they generally fall short in terms of absolute solution quality compared to classical search-based algorithms that are admittedly slower but offer optimality guarantee once search finishes.\n  We propose a novel framework that combines the inference efficiency and exploratory power of neural models with the solution quality guarantee of search-based algorithms. In particular, we use parameterized algorithms (PAs) as the search component. PAs are dedicated to identifying easy instances of generally NP-hard problems, and allow for practically efficient search by exploiting structural simplicity (of the identified easy instances). Under our framework, we use parameterized analysis to identify the structurally hard parts of a CO instance. The neural model handles the hard parts by generating advisory signals based on its data-driven understanding. The PA-based search component then integrates the advisory signals to systematically and efficiently searches through the remaining structurally easy parts. Notably, our framework is agnostic to the choice of neural model and produces strictly better solutions than neural solvers alone.\n  We examine our framework on multiple CO tasks. Empirical results show that it achieves superior solution quality, competitive with that of commercial solvers.

We present NNGPT, an open-source framework that turns a large language model (LLM) into a self-improving AutoML engine for neural network development, primarily for computer vision. Unlike previous frameworks, NNGPT extends the dataset of neural networks by generating new models, enabling continuous fine-tuning of LLMs based on closed-loop system of generation, assessment, and self-improvement. It integrates within one unified workflow five synergistic LLM-based pipelines: zero-shot architecture synthesis, hyperparameter optimization (HPO), code-aware accuracy/early-stop prediction, retrieval-augmented synthesis of scope-closed PyTorch blocks (NN-RAG), and reinforcement learning. Built on the LEMUR dataset as an audited corpus with reproducible metrics, NNGPT emits from a single prompt and validates network architecture, preprocessing code, and hyperparameters, executes them end-to-end, and learns from result. The PyTorch adapter makes NNGPT framework-agnostic, enabling strong performance: NN-RAG achieves 73% executability on 1,289 targets, 3-shot prompting boosts accuracy on common datasets, and hash-based deduplication saves hundreds of runs. One-shot prediction matches search-based AutoML, reducing the need for numerous trials.

While existing LLM agents depend on text-based mediation for reasoning and communication, we take a step forward by enabling models to collaborate directly within the continuous latent space. We introduce LatentMAS, an end-to-end training-free framework that enables pure latent collaboration among LLM agents. In LatentMAS, each agent first performs auto-regressive latent thoughts generation through last-layer hidden embeddings. A shared latent working memory then preserves and transfers each agent's internal representations, ensuring lossless information exchange. We provide theoretical analyses establishing that LatentMAS attains higher expressiveness and lossless information preservation with substantially lower complexity than vanilla text-based MAS. In addition, empirical evaluations across 9 comprehensive benchmarks spanning math and science reasoning, commonsense understanding, and code generation show that LatentMAS consistently outperforms strong single-model and text-based MAS baselines, achieving up to 14.6% higher accuracy, reducing output token usage by 70.8%-83.7%, and providing 4x-4.3x faster end-to-end inference.

However, existing multimodal learning frameworks, focused on vision and language, lack physical consistency and overlook the intrinsic causal relationships among an object's geometry, material, vibration modes, and the sounds it produces. We introduce VibraVerse, a large-scale geometry-acoustics alignment dataset that explicitly bridges the causal chain from 3D geometry -> physical attributes -> modal parameters -> acoustic signals. Each 3D model has explicit physical properties (density, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio) and volumetric geometry, from which modal eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors are computed for impact sound synthesis under controlled excitations. To establish this coherence, we introduce CLASP, a contrastive learning framework for cross-modal alignment that preserves the causal correspondence between an object's physical structure and its acoustic response. This framework enforces physically consistent alignment across modalities, ensuring that every sample is coherent, traceable to the governing equations, and embedded within a unified representation space spanning shape, image, and sound. Built upon VibraVerse, we define a suite of benchmark tasks for geometry-to-sound prediction, sound-guided shape reconstruction, and cross-modal representation learning.

For many tasks, multiple models can achieve identical performance while relying on different features or reasoning patterns, a property known as the Rashomon Effect. However, uncovering this diversity in deep architectures is challenging as their continuous parameter spaces contain countless near-optimal solutions that are numerically distinct but often behaviorally similar. We introduce Rashomon Concept Bottleneck Models, a framework that learns multiple neural networks which are all accurate yet reason through distinct human-understandable concepts. By combining lightweight adapter modules with a diversity-regularized training objective, our method constructs a diverse set of deep concept-based models efficiently without retraining from scratch. The resulting networks provide fundamentally different reasoning processes for the same predictions, revealing how concept reliance and decision making vary across equally performing solutions.

This leaves an underexplored research question: can we reduce the number of stacked transformer layers while maintaining comparable representational capacity? To answer this, we propose a branch-based structural reparameterization technique that operates during the training phase. Our approach leverages parallel branches within transformer blocks that can be systematically consolidated into streamlined single-path models suitable for inference deployment. The consolidation mechanism works by gradually merging branches at the entry points of nonlinear components, enabling both feed-forward networks (FFN) and multi-head self-attention (MHSA) modules to undergo exact mathematical reparameterization without inducing approximation errors at test time. When applied to ViT-Tiny, the framework successfully reduces the original 12-layer architecture to 6, 4, or as few as 3 layers while maintaining classification accuracy on ImageNet-1K. The resulting compressed models achieve inference speedups of up to 37% on mobile CPU platforms.

In this paper, we propose DRAFT-RL, a novel framework that integrates Chain-of-Draft (CoD) reasoning into multi-agent RL training. Instead of generating single responses, each agent produces multiple drafts per query, which are then evaluated by peer agents and a learned reward model to identify the most promising trajectory.

In this work, we focus on the smooth nonconvex-strongly-convex setting and develop new hard instances that yield nontrivial lower bounds under deterministic and stochastic first-order oracle models. In the deterministic case, we prove that any first-order zero-respecting algorithm requires at least $\u03a9(\u03ba^{3/2}\u03b5^{-2})$ oracle calls to find an $\u03b5$-accurate stationary point, improving the optimal lower bounds known for single-level nonconvex optimization and for nonconvex-strongly-convex min-max problems. In the stochastic case, we show that at least $\u03a9(\u03ba^{5/2}\u03b5^{-4})$ stochastic oracle calls are necessary, again strengthening the best known bounds in related settings.

Beginning with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting technique, numerous reasoning methods have emerged that decompose problems into smaller, sequential steps (or thoughts). However, existing reasoning models focus on conventional problem-solving and do not necessarily generate creative solutions by ``creative reasoning''. In domains where the solution space is expansive and conventional solutions are suboptimal, such as drug discovery or business strategization, creative reasoning to discover innovative solutions is crucial. To address this gap, first we introduce a computational framework for creative reasoning inspired by established cognitive science principles. With this framework, we propose three core creative reasoning paradigms, namely, \\textit{combinational}, \\textit{exploratory}, and \\textit{transformative} reasoning, where each offers specific directions for systematic exploration of the universe of thoughts to generate creative solutions. Next, to materialize this framework using LLMs, we introduce the \\textit{Universe of Thoughts} (or \\textit{UoT}, for short), a novel set of methods to implement the aforementioned three creative processes. Finally, we introduce three novel tasks that necessitate creative problem-solving, along with an evaluation benchmark to assess creativity from three orthogonal perspectives: feasibility as constraint, and utility and novelty as metrics. With a comparative analysis against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning techniques as well as representative commercial models with reasoning capability, we show that UoT demonstrates superior performance in creative reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u521b\u9020\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7ec4\u5408\u3001\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e09\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Universe of Thoughts\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u9700\u8981\u521b\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5e38\u89c4\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u5546\u4e1a\u7b56\u7565\u7b49\u9700\u8981\u521b\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u521b\u9020\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u4e09\u79cd\u521b\u9020\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff08\u7ec4\u5408\u3001\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u8f6c\u6362\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1Universe of Thoughts\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cUoT\u5728\u521b\u9020\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "UoT\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u521b\u9020\u6027\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u9700\u8981\u521b\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Existing neural models often struggle to represent these interacting dynamics, leading to unstable predictions and reduced reliability in downstream applications. This work introduces a forecast-blur-denoise framework that improves temporal fidelity through structured noise modeling. The approach incorporates a learnable Gaussian Process module that generates smooth, correlated perturbations, encouraging the forecasting backbone to capture long-range structure while a dedicated refinement model restores high-resolution temporal detail. Training the components jointly enables natural competence division and avoids the artifacts commonly produced by isotropic corruption methods. Experiments across electricity, traffic, and solar datasets show consistent gains in multi-horizon accuracy and stability. The modular design also allows the blur-denoise layer to operate as a lightweight enhancement for pretrained models, supporting efficient adaptation in limited-data scenarios.

The computation cost of OT, however, hinders its scalability. Slice-based transport plans have recently shown promise for reducing the computational cost by leveraging the closed-form solutions of 1D OT problems. These methods optimize a one-dimensional projection (slice) to obtain a conditional transport plan that minimizes the transport cost in the ambient space. While efficient, these methods leave open the question of whether learned optimal slicers can transfer to new distribution pairs under distributional shift. Understanding this transferability is crucial in settings with evolving data or repeated OT computations across closely related distributions. In this paper, we study the min-Sliced Transport Plan (min-STP) framework and investigate the transferability of optimized slicers: can a slicer trained on one distribution pair yield effective transport plans for new, unseen pairs? Theoretically, we show that optimized slicers remain close under slight perturbations of the data distributions, enabling efficient transfer across related tasks. To further improve scalability, we introduce a minibatch formulation of min-STP and provide statistical guarantees on its accuracy. Empirically, we demonstrate that the transferable min-STP achieves strong one-shot matching performance and facilitates amortized training for point cloud alignment and flow-based generative modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5207\u7247\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93(min-STP)\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u5207\u7247\u5668\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u8f7b\u5fae\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u5207\u7247\u5668\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5c0f\u6279\u91cfmin-STP\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5207\u7247\u4f20\u8f93\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u4f18\u5316\u5207\u7247\u5668\u5728\u65b0\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6f14\u5316\u6216\u91cd\u590d\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u5173\u5206\u5e03OT\u65f6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51famin-Sliced Transport Plan\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4f18\u5316\u5207\u7247\u5668\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5c0f\u6279\u91cfmin-STP\u516c\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u4f18\u5316\u5207\u7247\u5668\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u8f7b\u5fae\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fbmin-STP\u5728\u70b9\u4e91\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u6d41\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u6548\u7684\u5355\u6b21\u5339\u914d\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u644a\u9500\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5207\u7247\u5668\u5177\u6709\u8de8\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0cmin-STP\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, synthetic traffic is not inherently privacy-preserving, and the extent to which it leaks sensitive information, and how to measure such leakage, remain largely unexplored. This challenge is further compounded by the diversity of model architectures, which shape how traffic is represented and synthesized. We introduce a comprehensive set of privacy metrics for synthetic network traffic, combining standard approaches like membership inference attacks (MIA) and data extraction attacks with network-specific identifiers and attributes. Using these metrics, we systematically evaluate the vulnerability of different representative generative models and examine the factors that influence attack success. Our results reveal substantial variability in privacy risks across models and datasets. MIA success ranges from 0% to 88%, and up to 100% of network identifiers can be recovered from generated traffic, highlighting serious privacy vulnerabilities. We further identify key factors that significantly affect attack outcomes, including training data diversity and how well the generative model fits the training data. These findings provide actionable guidance for designing and deploying generative models that minimize privacy leakage, establishing a foundation for safer synthetic network traffic generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u5408\u6210\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u91cf\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0MIA\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u53ef\u8fbe88%\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u6062\u590d\u7387\u53ef\u8fbe100%\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5f71\u54cd\u653b\u51fb\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5408\u6210\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6d41\u91cf\u5e76\u975e\u5929\u7136\u5177\u6709\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5408\u6210\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u91cf\u9690\u79c1\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fbMIA\u548c\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u653b\u51fb\uff09\u4e0e\u7f51\u7edc\u7279\u5b9a\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u95f4\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff1aMIA\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ece0%\u523088%\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u6062\u590d\u7387\u53ef\u8fbe100%\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u9690\u79c1\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5f71\u54cd\u653b\u51fb\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u5982\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u62df\u5408\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u90e8\u7f72\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u5408\u6210\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Titsias"], "title": "Demystifying Diffusion Objectives: Reweighted Losses are Better Variational Bounds", "comment": null, "summary": "We derive a new theoretical interpretation of the reweighted losses that are widely used for training diffusion models. Our method is based on constructing a cascade of time-dependent variational lower bounds on the data log-likelihood, that provably improves upon the standard evidence lower bound and results in reduced data-model KL-divergences. Combining such bounds gives rise to reweighted objectives that can be applied to any generative diffusion model including both continuous Gaussian diffusion and masked (discrete) diffusion models. Then, we showcase this framework in masked diffusion and report significant improvements over previous training losses in pixel-space image modeling, approaching sample quality comparable to continuous diffusion models.

While fragment-based models handle limited data better than atom-based approaches, existing heuristic fragmentation limits diversity and misses key fragments. Additionally, model tuning typically requires slow, indirect collaboration between medicinal chemists and AI engineers. We introduce FRAGMENTA, an end-to-end framework for drug lead optimization comprising: 1) a novel generative model that reframes fragmentation as a \"vocabulary selection\" problem, using dynamic Q-learning to jointly optimize fragmentation and generation; and 2) an agentic AI system that refines objectives via conversational feedback from domain experts. This system removes the AI engineer from the loop and progressively learns domain knowledge to eventually automate tuning. In real-world cancer drug discovery experiments, FRAGMENTA's Human-Agent configuration identified nearly twice as many high-scoring molecules as baselines.

Multimodal neural networks have seen increasing use for identifying species to help automate this task, but they have two major drawbacks. First, their black-box nature prevents the interpretability of their decision making process. Second, collecting genetic data is often expensive and requires invasive procedures, often necessitating researchers to capture or kill the target specimen. We address both of these problems by extending prototype networks (ProtoPNets), which are a popular and interpretable alternative to traditional neural networks, to the multimodal, cost-aware setting. We ensemble prototypes from each modality, using an associated weight to determine how much a given prediction relies on each modality. We further introduce methods to identify cases for which we do not need the expensive genetic information to make confident predictions. We demonstrate that our approach can intelligently allocate expensive genetic data for fine-grained distinctions while using abundant image data for clearer visual classifications and achieving comparable accuracy to models that consistently use both modalities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u539f\u578b\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7269\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u57fa\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7269\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bf9\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u5165\u4fb5\u7269\u79cd\u8bc6\u522b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b58\u5728\u9ed1\u76d2\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u57fa\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u539f\u578b\u7f51\u7edc(ProtoPNets)\u5230\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u5404\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u539f\u578b\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5173\u8054\u6743\u91cd\u786e\u5b9a\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u57fa\u56e0\u4fe1\u606f\u5373\u53ef\u505a\u51fa\u81ea\u4fe1\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u667a\u80fd\u5206\u914d\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u57fa\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u7528\u4e8e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u539f\u578b\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u57fa\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e3a\u7269\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Objective: This study aimed to compare the performance of two LLMs: ChatGPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1 on real questions from the Chinese Pharmacist Licensing Examination (2017-2021), and to discuss the implications of these performance differences for AI-enabled formative evaluation. Methods: A total of 2,306 multiple-choice (text-only) questions were compiled from official exams, training materials, and public databases. Questions containing tables or images were excluded. Each item was input in its original Chinese format, and model responses were evaluated for exact accuracy. Pearson's Chi-squared test was used to compare overall performance, and Fisher's exact test was applied to year-wise multiple-choice accuracy. Results: DeepSeek-R1 outperformed ChatGPT-4o with a significantly higher overall accuracy (90.0% vs. 76.1%, p < 0.001). Unit-level analyses revealed consistent advantages for DeepSeek-R1, particularly in foundational and clinical synthesis modules. While year-by-year multiple-choice performance also favored DeepSeek-R1, this performance gap did not reach statistical significance in any specific unit-year (all p > 0.05). Conclusion: DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated robust alignment with the structural and semantic demands of the pharmacist licensure exam. These findings suggest that domain-specific models warrant further investigation for this context, while also reinforcing the necessity of human oversight in legally and ethically sensitive contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86ChatGPT-4o\u548cDeepSeek-R1\u5728\u4e2d\u56fd\u836f\u5e08\u6267\u4e1a\u8d44\u683c\u8003\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0DeepSeek-R1\u4ee590.0%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eChatGPT-4o\u768476.1%\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u5065\u5eb7\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u9ad8\u5229\u5bb3\u8ba4\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4e2d\u56fd\u836f\u5e08\u6267\u4e1a\u8d44\u683c\u8003\u8bd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u836f\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c62017-2021\u5e74\u5b98\u65b9\u8003\u8bd5\u3001\u57f9\u8bad\u6750\u6599\u548c\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\u76842,306\u9053\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u9898\uff0c\u6392\u9664\u542b\u8868\u683c\u6216\u56fe\u7247\u7684\u9898\u76ee\u3002\u4ee5\u539f\u59cb\u4e2d\u6587\u683c\u5f0f\u8f93\u5165\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5361\u65b9\u68c0\u9a8c\u548cFisher\u7cbe\u786e\u68c0\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "DeepSeek-R1\u603b\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8eChatGPT-4o\uff0890.0% vs 76.1%\uff0cp < 0.001\uff09\u3002\u5728\u5355\u5143\u5c42\u9762\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\uff0cDeepSeek-R1\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u7efc\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4f46\u5e74\u5ea6\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5728\u5177\u4f53\u5355\u5143\u5e74\u4efd\u4e2d\u672a\u8fbe\u5230\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u663e\u8457\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DeepSeek-R1\u5728\u836f\u5e08\u6267\u4e1a\u8d44\u683c\u8003\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u8003\u8bd5\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5951\u5408\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b64\u7c7b\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u503c\u5f97\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u654f\u611f\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u4eba\u5de5\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Low-diversity models tend to generate repetitive outputs, increasing sampling redundancy and hindering both creative exploration and downstream applications. A primary cause is that generation often collapses toward a strong mode in the learned distribution. Existing attempts to improve diversity, such as noise resampling, prompt rewriting, or steering-based guidance, often still collapse to dominant modes or introduce distortions that degrade image quality. In light of this, we propose Token-Prompt embedding Space Optimization (TPSO), a training-free and model-agnostic module. TPSO introduces learnable parameters to explore underrepresented regions of the token embedding space, reducing the tendency of the model to repeatedly generate samples from strong modes of the learned distribution.

Foundation models capable of in-context learning (ICL) offer a powerful solution, adapting to new tasks with minimal examples and reducing the need for extensive retraining. However, prior work on large-scale time series models has predominantly focused on forecasting, leaving a critical gap for versatile, fine-tuning-free classification. To address this, we introduce TiCT (Time-series in-Context Transformer), a transformer-based model pre-trained exclusively on synthetic data to perform in-context classification. We make two primary technical contributions: 1) a novel architecture featuring a scalable bit-based label encoding and a special output attention mechanism to handle an arbitrary number of classes; and 2) a synthetic pre-training framework that combines a Mixup-inspired process with data augmentation to foster generalization and noise invariance.

In Stage 1, the VLM-enhanced segmentation foundation model VESSA is trained as a reference-guided segmentation assistant using a template bank containing gold-standard exemplars, simulating learning from limited labeled data. Given an input-template pair, VESSA performs visual feature matching to extract representative semantic and spatial cues from exemplar segmentations, generating structured prompts for a SAM2-inspired mask decoder to produce segmentation masks. In Stage 2, VESSA is integrated into a state-of-the-art SSL framework, enabling dynamic interaction with the student model: as student predictions become more refined, they are fed back to VESSA as prompts, allowing it to generate higher-quality pseudo-labels and stronger guidance.

However, this often introduces large errors due to outliers in the weights. Proposed mitigation mechanisms include applying adaptive rounding, random rotation transformations or committing to a post-training target using calibration data. Unfortunately, this reliance on calibration data can be severely limiting in some real-world scenarios as such data may be unavailable or subject to privacy regulations. In this paper, we propose algorithms to optimize transformations and adaptive rounding without access to any calibration data. The optimization is achieved by designing a suitable proxy function for the quantization loss without calibration data. To maintain inference efficiency, we perform structured matrix transformations for single matrices. For paired weights that interact directly in the computation graph, we use dual matrix transformations and adaptive rounding methods. We conduct experiments on Gemma 2 models, and observe consistent improvement over the baselines. For Gemma 2 9B quantization, our method improves the average benchmark score from 61.9 to 62.4 for 4-bit quantization and from 52.0 to 60.6 for 3-bit quantization, while adding less than 3% of computation overhead.

Conventional evaluation metrics such as accuracy and precision fail to capture uncertainty or the reliability of model predictions, particularly under adversarial or degraded conditions. This paper introduces the \\emph{Parallel Trust Assessment System (PaTAS)}, a framework for modeling and propagating trust in neural networks using Subjective Logic (SL). PaTAS operates in parallel with standard neural computation through \\emph{Trust Nodes} and \\emph{Trust Functions} that propagate input, parameter, and activation trust across the network. The framework defines a \\emph{Parameter Trust Update} mechanism to refine parameter reliability during training and an \\emph{Inference-Path Trust Assessment (IPTA)} method to compute instance-specific trust at inference. Experiments on real-world and adversarial datasets demonstrate that PaTAS produces interpretable, symmetric, and convergent trust estimates that complement accuracy and expose reliability gaps in poisoned, biased, or uncertain data scenarios. The results show that PaTAS effectively distinguishes between benign and adversarial inputs and identifies cases where model confidence diverges from actual reliability. By enabling transparent and quantifiable trust reasoning within neural architectures, PaTAS provides a principled foundation for evaluating model reliability across the AI lifecycle.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PaTAS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e3b\u89c2\u903b\u8f91\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u4f20\u64ad\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u4fe1\u4efb\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6216\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6216\u9000\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e3b\u89c2\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u4efb\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u4f20\u64ad\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u53c2\u6570\u4fe1\u4efb\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u4fe1\u4efb\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cPaTAS\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e14\u6536\u655b\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u826f\u6027\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8f93\u5165", "conclusion": "PaTAS\u4e3a\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u900f\u660e\u548c\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u6574\u4e2aAI\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027"}}

Existing fixes -- freezing modules or applying uniform regularization -- either overconstrain adaptation or ignore the differing roles of VLA components. We present MAPS (Module-Wise Proximity Scheduling), the first robust fine-tuning framework for VLAs. Through systematic analysis, we uncover an empirical order in which proximity constraints should be relaxed to balance stability and flexibility. MAPS linearly schedules this relaxation, enabling visual encoders to stay close to their pretrained priors while action-oriented language layers adapt more freely. MAPS introduces no additional parameters or data, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLAs. Across MiniVLA-VQ, MiniVLA-OFT, OpenVLA-OFT, and challenging benchmarks such as SimplerEnv, CALVIN, LIBERO, as well as real-world evaluations on the Franka Emika Panda platform, MAPS consistently boosts both in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance (up to +30%).

Large language models (LLMs) offer a new paradigm by leveraging their pretrained knowledge and universal token-based representations to propose experiments directly from text-based descriptions. Here, we introduce an LLM-based active learning framework (LLM-AL) that operates in an iterative few-shot setting and benchmark it against conventional ML models across four diverse materials science datasets. We explored two prompting strategies: one using concise numerical inputs suited for datasets with more compositional and structured features, and another using expanded descriptive text suited for datasets with more experimental and procedural features to provide additional context. Across all datasets, LLM-AL could reduce the number of experiments needed to reach top-performing candidates by over 70% and consistently outperformed traditional ML models. We found that LLM-AL performs broader and more exploratory searches while still reaching the optima with fewer iterations. We further examined the stability boundaries of LLM-AL given the inherent non-determinism of LLMs and found its performance to be broadly consistent across runs, within the variability range typically observed for traditional ML approaches.

We revisit the SegFormer decoder and show that three small, synergistic changes make weak supervision markedly more effective-without altering the MiT backbone or relying on heavy post-processing. Our method, CrispFormer, augments the decoder with: (1) a boundary branch that supervises thin object contours using a lightweight edge head and a boundary-aware loss; (2) an uncertainty-guided refiner that predicts per-pixel aleatoric uncertainty and uses it to weight losses and gate a residual correction of the segmentation logits; and (3) a dynamic multi-scale fusion layer that replaces static concatenation with spatial softmax gating over multi-resolution features, optionally modulated by uncertainty. The result is a single-pass model that preserves crisp boundaries, selects appropriate scales per location, and resists label noise from weak cues. Integrated into a standard WSSS pipeline (seed, student, and EMA relabeling), CrispFormer consistently improves boundary F-score, small-object recall, and mIoU over SegFormer baselines trained on the same seeds, while adding minimal compute.

We then review and compare representative trajectory foundation models, such as TrajFM and TrajGPT, highlighting their architectural innovations and differences. Additionally, we introduce complementary techniques from related domains, like TimesFM's patching approach. Targeted at researchers and practitioners, this tutorial aims to explain the concepts and terminology of foundation models, at the implementation level. We find it timely and indispensable to create this educational material in order to support the SIGSPATIAL community in building and evaluating mobility foundation models, enhancing both research clarity and peer-review effectiveness in mobility AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6559\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eceGPT-2\u5f00\u59cb\u6784\u5efa\u8f68\u8ff9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7801\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\u5c55\u793a\u5982\u4f55\u5c06GPT-2\u9002\u914d\u4e8e\u65f6\u7a7a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86TrajFM\u548cTrajGPT\u7b49\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728AI\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u53d8\u9769\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u9488\u5bf9\u79fb\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6587\u6863\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e3aSIGSPATIAL\u793e\u533a\u63d0\u4f9b\u6559\u80b2\u6750\u6599\u6765\u652f\u6301\u79fb\u52a8AI\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5206\u6b65\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4eceGPT-2\u5f00\u59cb\u6784\u5efa\u8f68\u8ff9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165TimesFM\u7684\u8865\u4e01\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b49\u8865\u5145\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u8f68\u8ff9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u521b\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u6f14\u793a\u4e86\u4eceGPT-2\u5230\u8f68\u8ff9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9002\u914d\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u6307\u5357\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u79fb\u52a8\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u79fb\u52a8AI\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u548c\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

However, their capability for counterfactual reasoning, inferring alternative outcomes under hypothetical conditions, remains underexplored. This capability is essential for robust video understanding, as it requires identifying underlying causal structures and reasoning about unobserved possibilities, rather than merely recognizing observed patterns. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce CounterVQA, a video-based benchmark featuring three progressive difficulty levels that assess different aspects of counterfactual reasoning. Through comprehensive evaluation of both state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models, we uncover a substantial performance gap: while these models achieve reasonable accuracy on simple counterfactual questions, performance degrades significantly on complex multi-hop causal chains. To address these limitations, we develop a post-training method, CFGPT, that enhances a model's visual counterfactual reasoning ability by distilling its counterfactual reasoning capability from the language modality, yielding consistent improvements across all CounterVQA difficulty levels.

However, when used directly for step-level exploration, VLMs often exhibit frontier oscillations, unstable back-and-forth movements caused by overconfidence and miscalibration, leading to inefficient navigation and degraded answer quality. We propose Prune-Then-Plan, a simple and effective framework that stabilizes exploration through step-level calibration. Instead of trusting raw VLM scores, our method prunes implausible frontier choices using a Holm-Bonferroni inspired pruning procedure and then delegates final decisions to a coverage-based planner. This separation converts overconfident predictions into conservative, interpretable actions by relying on human-level judgments to calibrate the step-level behavior of VLMs. Integrated into the 3D-Mem EQA framework, our approach achieves relative improvements of up to 49% and 33% in visually grounded SPL and LLM-Match metrics respectively over baselines.

We propose a simple, PC-friendly evaluation protocol based on paired multi-seed runs, bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap confidence intervals, and a sign-flip permutation test on per-seed deltas. The protocol is intentionally conservative and is meant as a guardrail against over-claiming.\n  We instantiate it on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-10N, and AG News using synthetic no-improvement, small-gain, and medium-gain scenarios. Single runs and unpaired t-tests often suggest significant gains for 0.6-2.0 point improvements, especially on text.

When tokens from different spatial grids are mixed, the attention mechanism collapses. The issue is structural. Linear coordinate remapping forces a single attention head to compare RoPE phases sampled at incompatible rates, creating phase aliasing that destabilizes the score landscape. Pretrained DiTs are especially brittle-many heads exhibit extremely sharp, periodic phase selectivity-so even tiny cross-rate inconsistencies reliably cause blur, artifacts, or full collapse.\n  To this end, our main contribution is Cross-Resolution Phase-Aligned Attention (CRPA), a training-free drop-in fix that eliminates this failure at its source. CRPA modifies only the RoPE index map for each attention call: all Q/K positions are expressed on the query's stride so that equal physical distances always induce identical phase increments.

While all tested models were susceptible to emergent misalignment, some models showed more resistance than others. Specifically the Qwen-2.5 family proved to be relatively resistant, while GPT-4o exhibited the strongest misalignment. In this paper we evaluate if current-generation open-weights models exhibit similar resistance to the Qwen-2.5 family and measure misalignment robustness over a range of model architectures and scales.\n  We replicate the effect across nine modern open-weights models (Gemma 3 and Qwen 3 families, 1B-32B parameters). Models fine-tuned on insecure code generation show a 0.68% misalignment rate (compared to 0.07% for base models), matching the lower end of prior open-model results but dramatically lower than GPT-4o's 20%.\n  We identify a critical format-dependent vulnerability: requiring JSON output doubles misalignment rates compared to natural language prompts (0.96% vs 0.42%). This suggests that structural constraints may bypass safety training by reducing the model's 'degrees of freedom' to refuse. These findings confirm emergent misalignment as a reproducible phenomenon in modern open-weights models, with rates substantially lower than observed in proprietary systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

For example, OCR errors like misreading \"50 mph\" as \"60 mph\" could cause severe traffic accidents. This leads us to ask: Can VLMs know when they can't see? Existing abstention methods suggest pessimistic answers: they either rely on miscalibrated output probabilities or require semantic agreement unsuitable for OCR tasks. However, this failure may indicate we are looking in the wrong place: uncertainty signals could be hidden in VLMs' internal representations.\n  Building on this insight, we propose Latent Representation Probing (LRP): training lightweight probes on hidden states or attention patterns. We explore three probe designs: concatenating representations across all layers, aggregating attention over visual tokens, and ensembling single layer probes by majority vote. Experiments on four benchmarks across image and video modalities show LRP improves abstention accuracy by 7.6\\% over best baselines. Our analysis reveals: probes generalize across various uncertainty sources and datasets, and optimal signals emerge from intermediate rather than final layers.

In this work, we introduce a more fine-grained perspective that decomposes these components into orthogonal singular directions, revealing superposed and independent computations within a single head or MLP. We validate our perspective on widely used standard tasks like Indirect Object Identification (IOI), Gender Pronoun (GP), and Greater Than (GT), showing that previously identified canonical functional heads, such as the name mover, encode multiple overlapping subfunctions aligned with distinct singular directions. Nodes in a computational graph, that are previously identified as circuit elements show strong activation along specific low-rank directions, suggesting that meaningful computations reside in compact subspaces. While some directions remain challenging to interpret fully, our results highlight that transformer computations are more distributed, structured, and compositional than previously assumed. This perspective opens new avenues for fine-grained mechanistic interpretability and a deeper understanding of model internals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5c06transformer\u4e2d\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u548cMLP\u5c42\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6b63\u4ea4\u5947\u5f02\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5355\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5185\u53e0\u52a0\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u548cMLP\u5c42\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0d\u53ef\u5206\u5272\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5185\u90e8\u53ef\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u5c06transformer\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6b63\u4ea4\u5947\u5f02\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5728IOI\u3001GP\u3001GT\u7b49\u6807\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5148\u524d\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u5178\u578b\u529f\u80fd\u5934\uff08\u5982\u540d\u79f0\u79fb\u52a8\u5668\uff09\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0e\u4e0d\u540c\u5947\u5f02\u65b9\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u91cd\u53e0\u5b50\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4f4e\u79e9\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6fc0\u6d3b\u3002", "conclusion": "transformer\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u66f4\u52a0\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u5316\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Our approach simulates each training example's parameter influence through short-horizon gradient propagation during training and later reads out attributions for any query using only forward evaluations. This design shifts computation from inference to simulation, reflecting real deployment regimes where a model may serve billions of user queries but originate from a fixed, finite set of data sources (for example, a large language model trained on diverse corpora while compensating a specific publisher such as the New York Times). Empirically, on standard MLP benchmarks, our estimator matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines such as TRAK on standard attribution metrics (LOO and LDS) while offering orders-of-magnitude lower inference cost.

Token-level importance ratios often exhibit high variance-a phenomenon exacerbated in Mixture-of-Experts models-leading to unstable updates. Existing group-based policy optimization methods, such as GSPO and GRPO, alleviate this problem via hard clipping, making it difficult to maintain both stability and effective learning. We propose Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), which replaces hard clipping with a smooth, temperature-controlled gate that adaptively attenuates off-policy updates while preserving useful learning signals. Compared with GSPO and GRPO, SAPO is both sequence-coherent and token-adaptive. Like GSPO, SAPO maintains sequence-level coherence, but its soft gating forms a continuous trust region that avoids the brittle hard clipping band used in GSPO. When a sequence contains a few highly off-policy tokens, GSPO suppresses all gradients for that sequence, whereas SAPO selectively down-weights only the offending tokens and preserves the learning signal from the near-on-policy ones, improving sample efficiency. Relative to GRPO, SAPO replaces hard token-level clipping with smooth, temperature-controlled scaling, enabling more informative and stable updates. Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks indicate that SAPO exhibits improved training stability and higher Pass@1 performance under comparable training budgets.

LCAQ sensors have been shown to play a critical role in the establishment of dense, expansive air-quality monitoring networks and combating elevated pollution levels. The calibration of LCAQ sensors against regulatory-grade monitors is an expensive, laborious and time-consuming process, especially when a large number of sensors are to be deployed in a geographically diverse layout. In this work, we present the RESPIRE technique to calibrate LCAQ sensors to detect ambient CO (Carbon Monoxide) levels. RESPIRE offers specific advantages over baseline calibration methods popular in literature, such as improved prediction in cross-site, cross-season, and cross-sensor settings. RESPIRE offers a training algorithm that is provably resistant to outliers and an explainable model with the ability to flag instances of model overfitting.

Bigham", "Jason Wu"], "title": "DesignPref: Capturing Personal Preferences in Visual Design Generation", "comment": null, "summary": "Generative models, such as large language models and text-to-image diffusion models, are increasingly used to create visual designs like user interfaces (UIs) and presentation slides. Finetuning and benchmarking these generative models have often relied on datasets of human-annotated design preferences. Yet, due to the subjective and highly personalized nature of visual design, preference varies widely among individuals. In this paper, we study this problem by introducing DesignPref, a dataset of 12k pairwise comparisons of UI design generation annotated by 20 professional designers with multi-level preference ratings. We found that among trained designers, substantial levels of disagreement exist (Krippendorff's alpha = 0.25 for binary preferences). Natural language rationales provided by these designers indicate that disagreements stem from differing perceptions of various design aspect importance and individual preferences. With DesignPref, we demonstrate that traditional majority-voting methods for training aggregated judge models often do not accurately reflect individual preferences. To address this challenge, we investigate multiple personalization strategies, particularly fine-tuning or incorporating designer-specific annotations into RAG pipelines. Our results show that personalized models consistently outperform aggregated baseline models in predicting individual designers' preferences, even when using 20 times fewer examples.

However, their practical deployment is severely hampered by substantial static memory overhead, as all experts must be loaded into memory. Existing post-training pruning methods, while reducing model size, often derive their pruning criteria from a single, general-purpose corpus. This leads to a critical limitation: a catastrophic performance degradation when the pruned model is applied to other domains, necessitating a costly re-pruning for each new domain. To address this generalization gap, we introduce Mosaic Pruning (MoP). The core idea of MoP is to construct a functionally comprehensive set of experts through a structured ``cluster-then-select\" process. This process leverages a similarity metric that captures expert performance across different task domains to functionally cluster the experts, and subsequently selects the most representative expert from each cluster based on our proposed Activation Variability Score. Unlike methods that optimize for a single corpus, our proposed Mosaic Pruning ensures that the pruned model retains a functionally complementary set of experts, much like the tiles of a mosaic that together form a complete picture of the original model's capabilities, enabling it to handle diverse downstream tasks.Extensive experiments on various MoE models demonstrate the superiority of our approach. MoP significantly outperforms prior work, achieving a 7.24\\% gain on general tasks and 8.92\\% on specialized tasks like math reasoning and code generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Mosaic Pruning (MoP)\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u7a00\u758f\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9759\u6001\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u9009\u62e9\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4fdd\u7559\u529f\u80fd\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u4f7f\u526a\u679d\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6837\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u901a\u7528\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u526a\u679d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65b0\u9886\u57df\u91cd\u65b0\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\"\u805a\u7c7b-\u9009\u62e9\"\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u57df\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u529f\u80fd\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u4ece\u6bcf\u4e2a\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5177\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5404\u79cdMoE\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMoP\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5728\u901a\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f977.24%\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u4e13\u4e1a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f978.92%\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "Mosaic Pruning\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u7559\u529f\u80fd\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u4f7f\u526a\u679d\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

From Analysis to Path Forward", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent years have witnessed significant progress in Unified Multimodal Models, yet a fundamental question remains: Does understanding truly inform generation? To investigate this, we introduce UniSandbox, a decoupled evaluation framework paired with controlled, synthetic datasets to avoid data leakage and enable detailed analysis. Our findings reveal a significant understanding-generation gap, which is mainly reflected in two key dimensions: reasoning generation and knowledge transfer. Specifically, for reasoning generation tasks, we observe that explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in the understanding module effectively bridges the gap, and further demonstrate that a self-training approach can successfully internalize this ability, enabling implicit reasoning during generation. Additionally, for knowledge transfer tasks, we find that CoT assists the generative process by helping retrieve newly learned knowledge, and also discover that query-based architectures inherently exhibit latent CoT-like properties that affect this transfer. UniSandbox provides preliminary insights for designing future unified architectures and training strategies that truly bridge the gap between understanding and generation.

GED is determined by an optimal alignment between a pair of graphs that partitions each into aligned (zero-cost) and unaligned (cost-incurring) substructures. Due to NP-hard nature of exact GED computation, GED approximations based on Graph Neural Network(GNN) have emerged. Existing GNN-based GED approaches typically learn node embeddings for each graph and then aggregate pairwise node similarities to estimate the final similarity. Despite their effectiveness, we identify a mismatch between this prevalent node-centric matching paradigm and the core principles of GED. This discrepancy leads to two critical limitations: (1) a failure to capture the global structural correspondence for optimal alignment, and (2) a misattribution of edit costs driven by spurious node level signals. To address these limitations, we propose GCGSim, a GED-consistent graph similarity learning framework centering on graph-level matching and substructure-level edit costs. Specifically, we make three core technical contributions. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show that GCGSim achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Attention sparsity reduces computational costs by focusing on critical tokens while ignoring non-critical tokens. However, existing methods suffer from severe performance degradation. In this paper, we revisit attention sparsity and reveal that existing methods induce systematic biases in attention allocation: (1) excessive focus on critical tokens amplifies their attention weights; (2) complete neglect of non-critical tokens causes the loss of relevant attention weights. To address these issues, we propose Rectified SpaAttn, which rectifies attention allocation with implicit full attention reference, thereby enhancing the alignment between sparse and full attention maps. Specifically: (1) for critical tokens, we show that their bias is proportional to the sparse attention weights, with the ratio governed by the amplified weights. Accordingly, we propose Isolated-Pooling Attention Reallocation, which calculates accurate rectification factors by reallocating multimodal pooled weights. (2) for non-critical tokens, recovering attention weights from the pooled query-key yields attention gains but also introduces pooling errors. Therefore, we propose Gain-Aware Pooling Rectification, which ensures that the rectified gain consistently surpasses the induced error. Moreover, we customize and integrate the Rectified SpaAttn kernel using Triton, achieving up to 3.33 and 2.08 times speedups on HunyuanVideo and Wan 2.1, respectively, while maintaining high generation quality.

Unlike traditional 2D visual generation, World Models aim to construct realistic, dynamic, and physically consistent 3D/4D worlds from images, videos, or text. These models not only need to produce high-fidelity visual content but also maintain coherence across space, time, physics, and instruction control, enabling applications in virtual reality, autonomous driving, embodied intelligence, and content creation. However, prior benchmarks emphasize different evaluation dimensions and lack a unified assessment of world-realism capability. To systematically evaluate World Models, we introduce the 4DWorldBench, which measures models across four key dimensions: Perceptual Quality, Condition-4D Alignment, Physical Realism, and 4D Consistency. The benchmark covers tasks such as Image-to-3D/4D, Video-to-4D, Text-to-3D/4D. Beyond these, we innovatively introduce adaptive conditioning across multiple modalities, which not only integrates but also extends traditional evaluation paradigms. To accommodate different modality-conditioned inputs, we map all modality conditions into a unified textual space during evaluation, and further integrate LLM-as-judge, MLLM-as-judge, and traditional network-based methods. This unified and adaptive design enables more comprehensive and consistent evaluation of alignment, physical realism, and cross-modal coherence. Preliminary human studies further demonstrate that our adaptive tool selection achieves closer agreement with subjective human judgments.

We present SX-GeoTree, a self-explaining geospatial regression tree that integrates three coupled objectives during recursive splitting: impurity reduction (MSE), spatial residual control (global Moran's I), and explanation robustness via modularity maximization on a consensus similarity network formed from (a) geographically weighted regression (GWR) coefficient distances (stimulus-response similarity) and (b) SHAP attribution distances (explanatory similarity). We recast local Lipschitz continuity of feature attributions as a network community preservation problem, enabling scalable enforcement of spatially coherent explanations without per-sample neighborhood searches. Experiments on two exemplar tasks (county-level GDP in Fujian, n=83; point-wise housing prices in Seattle, n=21,613) show SX-GeoTree maintains competitive predictive accuracy (within 0.01 $R^{2}$ of decision trees) while improving residual spatial evenness and doubling attribution consensus (modularity: Fujian 0.19 vs 0.09; Seattle 0.10 vs 0.05). Ablation confirms Moran's I and modularity terms are complementary; removing either degrades both spatial residual structure and explanation stability.

However, fine-tuned models suffer from catastrophic forgetting. We create models that perform four tasks (object recognition, face recognition from high- and low-quality images, and person recognition from whole-body images) in a single embedding space -- without incurring substantial catastrophic forgetting. To accomplish this, we introduce two variants of the Interleaved Multi-Domain Identity Curriculum (IMIC): a gradient-coupled, interleaving training schedule that fine-tunes a foundation backbone simultaneously on all four tasks. The IMIC method proved effective with three foundation model bases: DINOv3, CLIP, and EVA-02. Two of these (EVA-02 and CLIP) performed comparably with domain experts on all four tasks concurrently and were more accurate than humans at multi-tasking across face, body, and object datasets. Further, we demonstrate that our approach does not substantially harm out-of-distribution generalization, thus maintaining a key property of foundation models. Analysis of the most accurate model variants (EVA-02 + IMIC A and B) showed linearly separable representations of the four tasks in the unified embedding space, but with substantial sharing of features across tasks.

While FL supports low-latency parallel training, it may converge to less accurate model. In contrast, SL achieves higher accuracy through sequential training but suffers from increased delay. To leverage the advantages of both, hybrid split and federated learning (HSFL) allows some devices to operate in FL mode and others in SL mode. This paper aims to accelerate HSFL by addressing three key questions: 1) How does learning mode selection affect overall learning performance? 2) How does it interact with batch size? 3) How can these hyperparameters be jointly optimized alongside communication and computational resources to reduce overall learning delay? We first analyze convergence, revealing the interplay between learning mode and batch size. Next, we formulate a delay minimization problem and propose a two-stage solution: a block coordinate descent method for a relaxed problem to obtain a locally optimal solution, followed by a rounding algorithm to recover integer batch sizes with near-optimal performance.

We maintain that road geometry is inherently curve-based and introduce the B\u00e9zier Graph, a differentiable parametric curve-based representation. The primary obstacle to this representation is to obtain the difficult-to-construct vector ground-truth (GT). We sidestep this bottleneck by reframing the task as a global optimization problem over the B\u00e9zier Graph. Our framework, DOGE, operationalizes this paradigm by learning a parametric B\u00e9zier Graph directly from segmentation masks, eliminating the need for curve GT.

Existing methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting typically bind Gaussians to mesh triangles and model deformations solely via Linear Blend Skinning, which results in rigid motion and limited expressiveness. Moreover, they lack specialized strategies to handle frequently occluded regions (e.g., mouth interiors, eyelids). To address these limitations, we propose STAvatar, which consists of two key components: (1) a UV-Adaptive Soft Binding framework that leverages both image-based and geometric priors to learn per-Gaussian feature offsets within the UV space. This UV representation supports dynamic resampling, ensuring full compatibility with Adaptive Density Control (ADC) and enhanced adaptability to shape and textural variations. (2) a Temporal ADC strategy, which first clusters structurally similar frames to facilitate more targeted computation of the densification criterion. It further introduces a novel fused perceptual error as clone criterion to jointly capture geometric and textural discrepancies, encouraging densification in regions requiring finer details. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that STAvatar achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance, especially in capturing fine-grained details and reconstructing frequently occluded regions.

Existing methods have established minimax-optimal regret bounds for universal online learning, where a single algorithm can simultaneously attain $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret for convex functions, $\\mathcal{O}(d \\log T)$ for exp-concave functions, and $\\mathcal{O}(\\log T)$ for strongly convex functions, where $T$ is the number of rounds and $d$ is the dimension of the feasible domain. However, these methods still lack problem-dependent adaptivity. In particular, no universal method provides regret bounds that scale with the gradient variation $V_T$, a key quantity that plays a crucial role in applications such as stochastic optimization and fast-rate convergence in games. In this work, we introduce UniGrad, a novel approach that achieves both universality and adaptivity, with two distinct realizations: UniGrad.Correct and UniGrad.Bregman. Both methods achieve universal regret guarantees that adapt to gradient variation, simultaneously attaining $\\mathcal{O}(\\log V_T)$ regret for strongly convex functions and $\\mathcal{O}(d \\log V_T)$ regret for exp-concave functions. For convex functions, the regret bounds differ: UniGrad.Correct achieves an $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{V_T \\log V_T})$ bound while preserving the RVU property that is crucial for fast convergence in online games, whereas UniGrad.Bregman achieves the optimal $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{V_T})$ regret bound through a novel design.

Prior work has proposed a range of heuristics to counteract this effect, but these methods are ad hoc: they frequently trade off correctness for diversity, their effectiveness varies across tasks, and in some cases they even contradict one another. In this work, we place these observations on a rigorous foundation. We first provide a formal proof of why RL fine-tuning exhibits diversity collapse via a selection and reinforcement bias. Next, we make a key observation that any reward modification to address diversity collapse only needs to be applied on the correct trajectories. Building directly on this analysis, we introduce a principled method -- \\textit{differential smoothing} -- that provably improves both correctness and diversity, outperforming vanilla RL as well as widely used entropy-based heuristics. Our theory precisely characterizes when existing heuristics help and why they fail, while showing that differential smoothing is universally superior. Extensive experiments with models from 1B to 7B parameters, across domains including CountDown and real-world mathematical reasoning, demonstrate consistent gains.

However, existing methodologies based on vision transformers or state-space models typically disrupt local structural consistency during temporal serialization, obscuring discriminative cues under misalignment and hindering reliable change localization. To address this, we introduce ChessMamba, a structure-aware framework leveraging interleaved state-space modeling for robust CD with multi-temporal inputs. ChessMamba integrates a SpatialMamba encoder with a lightweight cross-source interaction module, featuring two key innovations: (i) Chessboard interleaving with snake scanning order, which serializes multi-temporal features into a unified sequence within a single forward pass, thereby shortening interaction paths and enabling direct comparison for accurate change localization; and (ii) Structure-aware fusion via multi-dilated convolutions, selectively capturing center-and-corner neighborhood contexts within each mono-temporal. Comprehensive evaluations on three CD tasks, including binary CD, semantic CD and multimodal building damage assessment, demonstrate that ChessMamba effectively fuses heterogeneous features and achieves substantial accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art methods.The relevant code will be available at: github.com/DingLei14/ChessMamba.", "AI": {"tldr": "ChessMamba\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u65f6\u76f8\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68cb\u76d8\u4ea4\u9519\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u6216\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7834\u574f\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u53d8\u5316\u5e76\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faChessMamba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542bSpatialMamba\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8de8\u6e90\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u68cb\u76d8\u4ea4\u9519\u4e0e\u86c7\u5f62\u626b\u63cf\u987a\u5e8f\u5c06\u591a\u65f6\u76f8\u7279\u5f81\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6269\u5f20\u5377\u79ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e8c\u5143\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5efa\u7b51\u635f\u4f24\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cChessMamba\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u5f02\u6784\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "ChessMamba\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u65f6\u76f8\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u7cbe\u7ec6\u53d8\u5316\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

HSTAN employs a decoupled architecture (Graph Attention Network for spatial, cascaded GRU with self-attention for temporal) to achieve superior performance and efficiency, requiring only 12.3 ms inference time (73% faster than Transformer methods) and reducing the Average Displacement Error (ADE) to 0.73m (42.2% better than Social_LSTM) on the NGSIM dataset. Furthermore, Conformalized Quantile Regression enhances reliability by generating prediction intervals (91.3% coverage at 90% confidence), which the DTRA module then converts into timely warnings via a physics-informed risk potential function and an adaptive threshold mechanism inspired by statistical process control.Tested across multi-scenario datasets, the complete system demonstrates high efficacy, achieving an F1 score of 0.912, a low false alarm rate of 8.2%, and an ample warning lead time of 2.8 seconds, validating the framework's superior performance and practical deployment feasibility in complex environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u96c6\u6210\u524d\u5411\u78b0\u649e\u9884\u8b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5c42\u65f6\u7a7a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u98ce\u9669\u9608\u503c\u8c03\u6574\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728NGSIM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b073%\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u548c42.2%\u7684ADE\u6539\u5584\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u524d\u5411\u78b0\u649e\u9884\u8b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u578b\u7b80\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u9608\u503c\u8b66\u544a\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u9ad8\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5e73\u8861\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u65f6\u7a7a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f51\u7edc\uff08HSTAN\uff09\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f51\u7edc\u5904\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7ea7\u8054GRU\u4e0e\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u5e8f\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4fdd\u5f62\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u98ce\u9669\u9608\u503c\u8c03\u6574\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u53ca\u65f6\u8b66\u544a\u3002", "result": "\u5728NGSIM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4ec5\u970012.3ms\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\uff08\u6bd4Transformer\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb73%\uff09\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u81f30.73m\uff08\u6bd4Social_LSTM\u6539\u558442.2%\uff09\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u8fbe\u523091.3%\uff0890%\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edfF1\u5206\u65700.912\uff0c\u8bef\u62a5\u73878.2%\uff0c\u9884\u8b66\u63d0\u524d\u65f6\u95f42.8\u79d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8f66\u8f86\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

However, its effectiveness diminishes in cross-modal scenarios, such as vision-to-language distillation, where inconsistencies in representation across modalities lead to difficult knowledge transfer. To address this challenge, we propose frequency-decoupled cross-modal knowledge distillation, a method designed to decouple and balance knowledge transfer across modalities by leveraging frequency-domain features. We observed that low-frequency features exhibit high consistency across different modalities, whereas high-frequency features demonstrate extremely low cross-modal similarity. Accordingly, we apply distinct losses to these features: enforcing strong alignment in the low-frequency domain and introducing relaxed alignment for high-frequency features. We also propose a scale consistency loss to address distributional shifts between modalities, and employ a shared classifier to unify feature spaces. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets show our method substantially outperforms traditional KD and state-of-the-art cross-modal KD approaches.

In this paper, we investigate this problem of prompt fairness: specifically, the phrasing of a prompt by different users/styles, despite the same question being asked in principle, may elicit different responses from an LLM. To quantify this disparity, we propose to use information-theoretic metrics that can capture two dimensions of bias: subgroup sensitivity, the variability of responses within a subgroup and cross group consistency, the variability of responses across subgroups. Our analysis reveals that certain subgroups exhibit both higher internal variability and greater divergence from others. Our empirical analysis reveals that certain demographic sub groups experience both higher internal variability and greater divergence from others, indicating structural inequities in model behavior. To mitigate these disparities, we propose practical interventions, including majority voting across multiple generations and prompt neutralization, which together improve response stability and enhance fairness across user populations. In the experiments, we observe clear prompt sensitivity disparities across demographic subgroups: before mitigation, cross-group divergence values reach 0.28 and typically fall in the from 0.14 to 0.22 range. After applying our neutralization and multi generation strategy, these divergences consistently decrease, with the largest gap reduced to 0.22 and many distances falling to 0.17 or below, indicating more stable and consistent outputs across subgroups.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86LLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u6237/\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6307\u6807\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u6027\u5316\u7b49\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u6765\u6539\u5584\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u6237\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u98ce\u683c\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u65f6\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u95ee\u9898\u672c\u8d28\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u4e5f\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u63d0\u793a\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5b50\u7ec4\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u7ec4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u6027\u5316\u4e24\u79cd\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u524d\u8de8\u7ec4\u5206\u6b67\u503c\u8fbe\u52300.28\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u57280.14-0.22\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff1b\u5e94\u7528\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u540e\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5206\u6b67\u964d\u81f30.22\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u8ddd\u79bb\u964d\u81f30.17\u6216\u4ee5\u4e0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11LLMs\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b50\u7ec4\u95f4\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002"}}

Although CAD technology has advanced in recent years, the application scope of existing datasets remains relatively limited, typically supporting only single tasks, which has somewhat constrained the development of CAD technology.

The dataset includes CT volumes from 150 different cases, comprising four types of liver diseases as well as normal cases. Each volume has been carefully annotated and calibrated by experienced clinicians.

Recently, federated block coordinate descent scheme has become a popular option in training large-scale models, as it allows clients to train only a subset of the model locally instead of the entire model. However, in the era of large language models (LLMs), even a single block can contain a significant number of parameters, posing substantial communication latency, particularly for resource-constrained clients. To address this challenge in federated training/fine-tuning LLMs, we propose ParaBlock, a novel approach that establishes two parallel threads for communication and computation to enhance communication efficiency.

To address these challenges, we propose a verification-centric Generate-then-Verify framework that first generates QA pairs with figure-associated textual context, then applies cross-modal consistency checks against figures along with auxiliary filters to eliminate erroneous pairs. We instantiate this framework to curate VeriSciQA, a dataset of 20,351 QA pairs spanning 20 scientific domains and 12 figure types.

Moreover, models fine-tuned on VeriSciQA achieve consistent improvements on SVQA benchmarks, with performance gains that scale with data size and surpass models trained on existing datasets.

However, such a design encounters significant challenges, such as the risk of outdated updates from straggler clients degrading the overall model performance and the potential bias introduced by faster clients dominating the learning process, especially under heterogeneous data distributions. Existing methods typically address only one of these issues, creating a conflict where mitigating the impact of outdated updates can exacerbate the bias created by faster clients, and vice versa. To address these challenges, we propose FedEcho, a novel framework that incorporates uncertainty-aware distillation to enhance the asynchronous FL performances under large asynchronous delays and data heterogeneity. Specifically, uncertainty-aware distillation enables the server to assess the reliability of predictions made by straggler clients, dynamically adjusting the influence of these predictions based on their estimated uncertainty. By prioritizing more certain predictions while still leveraging the diverse information from all clients, FedEcho effectively mitigates the negative impacts of outdated updates and data heterogeneity.

Recent self-rewarding approaches attempt to overcome this constraint by allowing models to act as their own critics or reward providers. Yet, purely text-based self-evaluation struggles to verify complex visual reasoning steps and often suffers from evaluation hallucinations. To address these challenges, inspired by recent advances in tool-integrated reasoning, we propose Agent0-VL, a self-evolving vision-language agent that achieves continual improvement with tool-integrated reasoning. Agent0-VL incorporates tool usage not only into reasoning but also into self-evaluation and self-repair, enabling the model to introspect, verify, and refine its reasoning through evidence-grounded analysis. It unifies two synergistic roles within a single LVLM: a Solver that performs multi-turn tool-integrated reasoning, and a Verifier that generates structured feedback and fine-grained self-rewards through tool-grounded critique. These roles interact through a Self-Evolving Reasoning Cycle, where tool-based verification and reinforcement learning jointly align the reasoning and evaluation distributions for stable self-improvement. Through this zero-external-reward evolution, Agent0-VL aligns its reasoning and verification behaviors without any human annotation or external reward models, achieving continual self-improvement. Experiments on geometric problem solving and visual scientific analysis show that Agent0-VL achieves an 12.5% improvement over the base model.

Subsequent studies have achieved further improvements through refining the message passing schemes in GNN models or exploiting various data augmentation techniques to mitigate limited supervision. In real graphs, nodes often tend to form tightly-knit communities/clusters, which embody abundant signals for compensating label scarcity in semi-supervised node classification but are not explored in prior methods.\n  Inspired by this, this paper presents NCGC that integrates self-supervised graph clustering and semi-supervised classification into a unified framework. Firstly, we theoretically unify the optimization objectives of GNNs and spectral graph clustering, and based on that, develop soft orthogonal GNNs (SOGNs) that leverage a refined message passing paradigm to generate node representations for both classification and clustering. On top of that, NCGC includes a self-supervised graph clustering module that enables the training of SOGNs for learning representations of unlabeled nodes in a self-supervised manner. Particularly, this component comprises two non-trivial clustering objectives and a Sinkhorn-Knopp normalization that transforms predicted cluster assignments into balanced soft pseudo-labels. Through combining the foregoing clustering module with the classification model using a multi-task objective containing the supervised classification loss on labeled data and self-supervised clustering loss on unlabeled data, NCGC promotes synergy between them and achieves enhanced model capacity.

Another focus of this work is the incorporation of information from 3D handshape for boundary detection. To detect handshapes normally expected at the beginning and end of signs, we pretrain a handshape classifier for 87 linguistically defined canonical handshape categories using a dataset that we created by integrating and normalizing several existing datasets. A multimodal fusion module is then used to unify the pretrained sign video segmentation framework and the handshape classification models. Finally, the estimated boundaries are used for sign recognition, where the recognition model is trained on a large database containing both citation-form isolated signs and signs pre-segmented (based on manual annotations) from continuous signing, as such signs often differ in certain respects.

Previous works typically employ geometric, generative, or simulation priors to guide the transfer process, but these external priors introduce auxiliary constraints that lead to trade-offs between generalizability and temporal consistency. To address these limitations, we propose guiding the motion transfer process through an internal prior that exclusively captures the spatial-temporal transformations and is shared between the source video and any transferred target video. Specifically, we first lift both the source video and the target image into a unified 3D representation space. Motion trajectories are then extracted from the source video to construct a spatial-temporal (SpaT) prior that is independent of object geometry and semantics, encoding relative spatial variations over time.

This approach leverages the largest-ever optically printed 3D specimen dataset, comprising a large family of parametrically designed complex minimal surface structures that have undergone terminal chemical characterisation. Conventional vision models are ill-equipped for this task, as they lack an inductive bias for the coupled, non-linear interactions of optical physics (diffraction, absorption) and material physics (diffusion, convection) that govern the final chemical state. To address this, we propose Coupled Physics-Gated Adaptation (C-PGA), a novel multimodal fusion architecture. Unlike standard concatenation, C-PGA explicitly models physical coupling by using sparse geometrical and process parameters (e.g., surface transport, print layer height) as a Query to dynamically gate and adapt the dense visual features via feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM). This mechanism spatially modulates dual 3D visual streams-extracted by parallel 3D-CNNs processing raw projection stacks and their diffusion-diffraction corrected counterparts allowing the model to recalibrate its visual perception based on the physical context. This approach offers a breakthrough in virtual chemical characterisation, eliminating the need for traditional post-print measurements and enabling precise control over the chemical conversion state.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9884\u6d4b3D\u6253\u5370\u7269\u4f53\u5149\u5316\u5b66\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7C-PGA\u67b6\u6784\u4ece3D\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u975e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u5149\u5b66\u7269\u7406\u4e0e\u6750\u6599\u7269\u7406\u8026\u5408\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5904\u7406\u5149\u5b66\u7269\u7406\uff08\u884d\u5c04\u3001\u5438\u6536\uff09\u4e0e\u6750\u6599\u7269\u7406\uff08\u6269\u6563\u3001\u5bf9\u6d41\uff09\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8026\u5408\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ece3D\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5316\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faC-PGA\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u5de5\u827a\u53c2\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3aQuery\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7FiLM\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u95e8\u63a7\u548c\u8c03\u6574\u5bc6\u96c6\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u884c\u5904\u7406\u539f\u59cb\u6295\u5f71\u5806\u6808\u53ca\u5176\u6269\u6563-\u884d\u5c04\u6821\u6b63\u7248\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u865a\u62df\u5316\u5b66\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u7a81\u7834\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f20\u7edf\u6253\u5370\u540e\u6d4b\u91cf\u5373\u53ef\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u5316\u5b66\u8f6c\u6362\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "C-PGA\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u7269\u7406\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece3D\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u590d\u6742\u7269\u7406\u5316\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5236\u9020\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing TTS methods operate at the full-image level, overlooking the fact that image quality is often spatially heterogeneous. This leads to unnecessary computation on already satisfactory regions and insufficient correction of localized defects. In this paper, we explore a new direction - Localized TTS - that adaptively resamples defective regions while preserving high-quality regions, thereby substantially reducing the search space. This paradigm poses two central challenges: accurately localizing defects and maintaining global consistency. We propose LoTTS, the first fully training-free framework for localized TTS. For defect localization, LoTTS contrasts cross- and self-attention signals under quality-aware prompts (e.g., high-quality vs. low-quality) to identify defective regions, and then refines them into coherent masks. For consistency, LoTTS perturbs only defective regions and denoises them locally, ensuring that corrections remain confined while the rest of the image remains undisturbed. Extensive experiments on SD2.1, SDXL, and FLUX demonstrate that LoTTS achieves state-of-the-art performance: it consistently improves both local quality and global fidelity, while reducing GPU cost by 2-4x compared to Best-of-N sampling.

We show that whenever similarity between concepts can be expressed as monotone witness overlap -- whether arising from graph neighborhoods, causal relations, temporal structure, topological features, symbolic patterns, or embedding-based neighborhoods -- it admits a reduction to compact encodings with provable ranking preservation guarantees. REWA systems consist of: (1) finite witness sets $W(v)$, (2) semi-random bit assignments generated from each witness, and (3) monotonicity of expected similarity in the overlap $\u0394(u, v) = |W(u) \\cap W(v)|$. We prove that under an overlap-gap condition on the final witness sets -- independent of how they were constructed -- top-$k$ rankings are preserved using $m = O(\\log(|V|/\u03b4))$ bits. The witness-set formulation is compositional: any sequence of structural, temporal, causal, topological, information-theoretic, or learned transformations can be combined into pipelines that terminate in discrete witness sets. The theory applies to the final witness overlap, enabling modular construction of similarity systems from reusable primitives. This yields a vast design space: millions of composable similarity definitions inherit logarithmic encoding complexity. REWA subsumes and unifies Bloom filters, minhash, LSH bitmaps, random projections, sketches, and hierarchical filters as special cases. It provides a principled foundation for similarity systems whose behavior is governed by witness overlap rather than hash-function engineering.

The diffusion component iteratively refines bounding-box hypotheses, whereas the autoregressive component injects semantic and contextual awareness, enabling precise region prediction even in highly varied layouts. To further enhance detection quality, we design a multi-scale feature-fusion encoder that captures both fine-grained and high-level visual cues. This architecture elevates performance to 83.5% mean Average Precision (mAP). Extensive experiments on the DocLayNet and M$^6$Doc benchmarks demonstrate that HybriDLA sets a state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous approaches.

Using the HiQ dataset (U.S., 2000-2022), we systematically compare statistical baselines, a fully supervised LSTM, and the Sundial foundation model under multiple evaluation protocols. We find that Sundial, in the zero-shot setting, can outperform a fully trained LSTM provided that the input context window is sufficiently long-specifically, when covering more than one or two full seasonal cycles. This demonstrates, for the first time, that a general-purpose foundation model can surpass specialized supervised models on remote-sensing time series prediction without any task-specific tuning.

However, conventional methods face significant limitations: manual features (e.g., SIFT) lack robustness; deep learning-based detectors (e.g., YOLO) can identify component presence but cannot perform state-specific retrieval or zero-shot search; Visual Large Models (VLMs) offer semantic and zero-shot capabilities but suffer from poor spatial grounding and high computational cost, making them inefficient for direct retrieval. To bridge these gaps, this paper proposes DetVLM, a novel intelligent image search framework that synergistically fuses object detection with VLMs. The framework pioneers a search-enhancement paradigm via a two-stage pipeline: a YOLO detector first conducts efficient, high-recall component-level screening to determine component presence; then, a VLM acts as a recall-enhancement unit, performing secondary verification for components missed by the detector. This architecture directly enables two advanced capabilities: 1) State Search: Guided by task-specific prompts, the VLM refines results by verifying component existence and executing sophisticated state judgments (e.g., \"sun visor lowered\"), allowing retrieval based on component state. 2) Zero-shot Search: The framework leverages the VLM's inherent zero-shot capability to recognize and retrieve images containing unseen components or attributes (e.g., \"driver wearing a mask\") without any task-specific training. Experiments on a vehicle component dataset show DetVLM achieves a state-of-the-art overall retrieval accuracy of 94.82\\%, significantly outperforming detection-only baselines.

However, constructing high-fidelity indoor RMs remains challenging due to the prohibitive latency of EM solvers and the limitations of learning-based methods, which often rely on sparse measurements or assumptions of homogeneous material, which are misaligned with the heterogeneous and multipath-rich nature of indoor environments. To overcome these challenges, we propose iRadioDiff, a sampling-free diffusion-based framework for indoor RM construction. iRadioDiff is conditioned on access point (AP) positions, and physics-informed prompt encoded by material reflection and transmission coefficients. It further incorporates multipath-critical priors, including diffraction points, strong transmission boundaries, and line-of-sight (LoS) contours, to guide the generative process via conditional channels and boundary-weighted objectives. This design enables accurate modeling of nonstationary field discontinuities and efficient construction of physically consistent RMs. Experiments demonstrate that iRadioDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in indoor RM construction and received signal strength based indoor localization, which offers effective generalization across layouts and material configurations.

Clustering over such data finds numerous practical applications in real scenarios, including social community detection, medical data analytics, etc. However, as revealed by our empirical studies, existing multi-view clustering solutions largely rely on the high correlation between attributes across various views and overlook the unique characteristics (e.g., low modality-wise correlation and intense feature-wise noise) of multimodal attributes output by large pre-trained language and vision models in MMAGs, leading to suboptimal clustering performance.\n  Inspired by foregoing empirical observations and our theoretical analyses with graph signal processing, we propose the Dual Graph Filtering (DGF) scheme, which innovatively incorporates a feature-wise denoising component into node representation learning, thereby effectively overcoming the limitations of traditional graph filters adopted in the extant multi-view graph clustering approaches. On top of that, DGF includes a tri-cross contrastive training strategy that employs instance-level contrastive learning across modalities, neighborhoods, and communities for learning robust and discriminative node representations.

However, enabling an excessive proportion of background search tokens to attend to the target template tokens weakens the tracker's discriminative capability. Several token pruning methods have been proposed to mitigate background interference; however, they often remove tokens near the target, leading to the loss of essential contextual information and degraded tracking performance. Moreover, the presence of distractors within the search tokens further reduces the tracker's ability to accurately identify the target. To address these limitations, we propose CPDATrack, a novel tracking framework designed to suppress interference from background and distractor tokens while enhancing computational efficiency. First, a learnable module is integrated between two designated encoder layers to estimate the probability of each search token being associated with the target. Based on these estimates, less-informative background tokens are pruned from the search region while preserving the contextual cues surrounding the target. To further suppress background interference, a discriminative selective attention mechanism is employed that fully blocks search-to-template attention in the early layers. In the subsequent encoder layers, high-probability target tokens are selectively extracted from a localized region to attend to the template tokens, thereby reducing the influence of background and distractor tokens.

Das"], "title": "RED-F: Reconstruction-Elimination based Dual-stream Contrastive Forecasting for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Prediction", "comment": "13 pages, 12 figures", "summary": "The proactive prediction of anomalies (AP) in multivariate time series (MTS) is a critical challenge to ensure system dependability. The difficulty lies in identifying subtle anomaly precursors concealed within normal signals. However, existing unsupervised methods, trained exclusively on normal data, demonstrate a fundamental propensity to reconstruct normal patterns. Consequently, when confronted with weak precursors, their predictions are dominated by the normal pattern, submerging the very signal required for prediction. To contend with the limitation, we propose RED-F, a Reconstruction-Elimination based Dual-stream Contrastive Forecasting framework, comprising the Reconstruction-Elimination Model (REM) and the Dual-stream Contrastive Forecasting Model (DFM). The REM utilizes a hybrid time-frequency mechanism to mitigate the precursor, generating a purified, normal-pattern baseline. The DFM then receives this purified baseline and the original sequence which retains the precursor as parallel inputs. At the core of our framework, RED-F employs a contrastive forecast that transforms the difficult task of absolute signal detection into a simpler, more robust task of relative trajectory comparison by computing the divergence between these two predictive streams.

SOMBRL learns an uncertainty-aware dynamics model and greedily maximizes a weighted sum of the extrinsic reward and the agent's epistemic uncertainty.

Additionally, SOMBRL offers a flexible and scalable solution for principled exploration.

However, existing approaches often rely on free-form natural language descriptions that are often ambiguous, redundant, and unstructured, which poses significant challenges for downstream Verilog code generation. We treat hardware code generation as a complex transformation from an open-ended natural language space to a domain-specific, highly constrained target space. To bridge this gap, we introduce Core Refined Understanding eXpression (CRUX), a structured intermediate space that captures the essential semantics of user intent while organizing the expression for precise Verilog code generation. We further design a two-stage training framework, comprising Joint Expression Modeling and Dual-Space Optimization, to enhance the quality of both CRUX and Verilog code. Experiments across multiple Verilog generation benchmarks demonstrate that our model, CRUX-V, achieves state-of-the-art performance among general models, particularly under challenging design tasks.

While large vision foundation models have shown promise for zero-shot biomedical segmentation, most existing approaches still depend on dense supervision and computationally expensive fine-tuning. Consequently, training-free methods present a compelling research direction, yet remain largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce SPROUT, a fully training- and annotation-free prompting framework for nuclear instance segmentation. SPROUT leverages histology-informed priors to construct slide-specific reference prototypes that mitigate domain gaps. These prototypes progressively guide feature alignment through a partial optimal transport scheme. The resulting foreground and background features are transformed into positive and negative point prompts, enabling the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to produce precise nuclear delineations without any parameter updates. Extensive experiments across multiple histopathology benchmarks demonstrate that SPROUT achieves competitive performance without supervision or retraining, establishing a novel paradigm for scalable, training-free nuclear instance segmentation in pathology.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPROUT\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6838\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b66\u5148\u9a8c\u6784\u5efa\u5207\u7247\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u53c2\u8003\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u90e8\u5206\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u65b9\u6848\u6307\u5bfc\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5c06\u7279\u5f81\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u70b9\u63d0\u793a\u4f7fSAM\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6838\u5206\u5272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6838\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bc6\u96c6\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "method": "SPROUT\u5229\u7528\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b66\u5148\u9a8c\u6784\u5efa\u5207\u7247\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u53c2\u8003\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u90e8\u5206\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u65b9\u6848\u8fdb\u884c\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5c06\u524d\u666f\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u7279\u5f81\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6b63\u8d1f\u70b9\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4f7fSegment Anything Model\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u5373\u53ef\u8fdb\u884c\u6838\u5206\u5272\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSPROUT\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u76d1\u7763\u6216\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SPROUT\u4e3a\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6838\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Our approach integrates the Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to extract compact, discriminative spectral features from 3D face meshes. To secure these features, we introduce a spectral diffusion mechanism that produces irreversible, renewable, and unlinkable templates. A lightweight client-server architecture ensures that raw biometric data never leaves the client device.

Utilizing a comprehensive set of 69 predictors -- encompassing market, behavioral, and macroeconomic indicators -- we evaluate the performance of LGBM-based models and compare them with both econometric and machine learning baselines. For probabilistic forecasting, we explore two quantile-based approaches: direct quantile regression using the pinball loss function, and a residual simulation method that transforms point forecasts into predictive distributions. To identify the main drivers of volatility, we employ gain-based and permutation feature importance techniques, consistently highlighting the significance of trading volume, lagged volatility measures, investor attention, and market capitalization. The results demonstrate that LGBM models effectively capture the nonlinear and high-variance characteristics of cryptocurrency markets while providing interpretable insights into the underlying volatility dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528LightGBM\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u5b9e\u73b0\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u8fdb\u884c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6982\u7387\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u4ea4\u6613\u91cf\u3001\u6ede\u540e\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u3001\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5173\u6ce8\u5ea6\u548c\u5e02\u503c\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22LightGBM\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u8fd9\u79cd\u9ad8\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u8d44\u4ea7\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u752869\u4e2a\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5e02\u573a\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6307\u6807\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528LightGBM\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6982\u7387\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u76f4\u63a5\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u6b8b\u5dee\u6a21\u62df\u5c06\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u589e\u76ca\u548c\u6392\u5217\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6280\u672f\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3b\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "result": "LightGBM\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4e00\u81f4\u663e\u793a\u4ea4\u6613\u91cf\u3001\u6ede\u540e\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u3001\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5173\u6ce8\u5ea6\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u5e02\u503c\u662f\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "LightGBM\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u6ce2\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u5e02\u573a\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

We address this limitation by proposing \\textbf{MambaEye}, a novel, causal sequential encoder that leverages the low complexity and causal-process based pure Mamba2 backbone. Unlike previous Mamba-based vision encoders that often employ bidirectional processing, our strictly unidirectional approach preserves the inherent causality of State Space Models, enabling the model to generate a prediction at any point in its input sequence. A core innovation is our use of relative move embedding, which encodes the spatial shift between consecutive patches, providing a strong inductive bias for translation invariance and making the model inherently adaptable to arbitrary image resolutions and scanning patterns. To achieve this, we introduce a novel diffusion-inspired loss function that provides dense, step-wise supervision, training the model to build confidence as it gathers more visual evidence. We demonstrate that MambaEye exhibits robust performance across a wide range of image resolutions, especially at higher resolutions such as $1536^2$ on the ImageNet-1K classification task.

However, when confronted with complex prompts involving multiple objects and hierarchical structures, existing models struggle to accurately follow instructions, leading to issues such as concept omission, confusion, and poor compositionality. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Compositional Generative framework (HiCoGen) built upon a novel Chain of Synthesis (CoS) paradigm. Instead of monolithic generation, HiCoGen first leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to decompose complex prompts into minimal semantic units. It then synthesizes these units iteratively, where the image generated in each step provides crucial visual context for the next, ensuring all textual concepts are faithfully constructed into the final scene. To further optimize this process, we introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) framework. Crucially, we identify that the limited exploration of standard diffusion samplers hinders effective RL. We theoretically prove that sample diversity is maximized by concentrating stochasticity in the early generation stages and, based on this insight, propose a novel Decaying Stochasticity Schedule to enhance exploration. Our RL algorithm is then guided by a hierarchical reward mechanism that jointly evaluates the image at the global, subject, and relationship levels.

Building on the concept of tensor flow divergence, which quantifies how information is transformed across network layers, we develop a two-stage optimization process. The first stage employs iterative divergence-aware pruning to identify and remove redundant filters while preserving critical information pathways. The second stage extends this principle to higher-level architecture optimization by analyzing layer-wise contributions to information propagation and selectively eliminating entire layers that demonstrate minimal impact on network performance. The proposed method naturally adapts to diverse architectures, including convolutional networks, transformers, and hybrid designs, providing a consistent metric for comparing the structural importance across different layer types. Experimental validation across multiple modern architectures and datasets reveals that this combined approach achieves substantial model compression while maintaining competitive accuracy. The presented approach achieves parameter reduction results that are globally comparable to those of state-of-the-art solutions and outperforms them across a wide range of modern neural network architectures, from convolutional models to transformers.

While 3D foundation models like VGGT provide accurate 3D geometry, their performance drops markedly when moving objects dominate. Existing 4D approaches often rely on external priors, heavy post-optimization, or require fine-tuning on 4D datasets. In this paper, we propose VGGT4D, a training-free framework that extends the 3D foundation model VGGT for robust 4D scene reconstruction. Our approach is motivated by the key finding that VGGT's global attention layers already implicitly encode rich, layer-wise dynamic cues. To obtain masks that decouple static and dynamic elements, we mine and amplify global dynamic cues via gram similarity and aggregate them across a temporal window. To further sharpen mask boundaries, we introduce a refinement strategy driven by projection gradient. We then integrate these precise masks into VGGT's early-stage inference, effectively mitigating motion interference in both pose estimation and geometric reconstruction. Across six datasets, our method achieves superior performance in dynamic object segmentation, camera pose estimation, and dense reconstruction. It also supports single-pass inference on sequences longer than 500 frames.", "AI": {"tldr": "VGGT4D\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c063D\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578bVGGT\u6269\u5c55\u52304D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6316\u6398VGGT\u5168\u5c40\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u9759\u6001\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67094D\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u5148\u9a8c\u3001\u7e41\u91cd\u540e\u4f18\u5316\u6216\u9700\u8981\u57284D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u800cVGGT\u7b493D\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e3b\u5bfc\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u52a8\u6001\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7Gram\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6316\u6398\u548c\u653e\u5927\u5168\u5c40\u52a8\u6001\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6295\u5f71\u68af\u5ea6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7ec6\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u9510\u5316\u63a9\u7801\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u7cbe\u786e\u63a9\u7801\u96c6\u6210\u5230VGGT\u65e9\u671f\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u5272\u3001\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5355\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u8d85\u8fc7500\u5e27\u7684\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "conclusion": "VGGT4D\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86VGGT\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u5df2\u9690\u542b\u7f16\u7801\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u76844D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u8f7b\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e72\u6270\u3002"}}

This is particularly appealing in Federated Learning (FL), where momentum intuitively appears as a solution to mitigate the effects of statistical heterogeneity.

In this work we analyze momentum under cyclic client participation, and theoretically prove that it remains inevitably affected by statistical heterogeneity. Similarly to SGD, we prove that decreasing step-sizes do not help either: in fact, any schedule decreasing faster than $\u0398\\left(1/t\\right)$ leads to convergence to a constant value that depends on the initialization and the heterogeneity bound.

We begin by exploring how input activations are affected by RLVR through the perspective of logit lens. Our systematic investigations across multiple post-trained LMMs suggest that RLVR shifts low-entropy activations unexpectedly, while high-entropy ones are less affected. We further demonstrate that such phenomena are associated with LMM reasoning by controlled experiments, suggesting a potentially beneficial role of modulating low-entropy activations. To this end, we propose Activation Replay, a novel simple yet effective training-free approach that boosts multimodal reasoning of post-trained LMMs without requiring expensive policy optimization. Our design involves manipulation of visual tokens at test time, replaying low-entropy activations from the input context of base LMMs to regulating the RLVR counterparts. Activation Replay triggers better reasoning across diverse scenarios, including mathematics, o3-like visual agents, and video reasoning.

However, existing approaches lack emotional feedback from generated images, limiting the control of emotional continuity. Additionally, their simple alignment between emotions and naively generated texts fails to adaptively adjust emotional prompts according to image content, leading to insufficient emotional fidelity. To address these concerns, we propose a novel generation-understanding-feedback reinforcement paradigm (EmoFeedback2) for C-EICG, which exploits the reasoning capability of the fine-tuned large vision-language model (LVLM) to provide reward and textual feedback for generating high-quality images with continuous emotions. Specifically, we introduce an emotion-aware reward feedback strategy, where the LVLM evaluates the emotional values of generated images and computes the reward against target emotions, guiding the reinforcement fine-tuning of the generative model and enhancing the emotional continuity of images. Furthermore, we design a self-promotion textual feedback framework, in which the LVLM iteratively analyzes the emotional content of generated images and adaptively produces refinement suggestions for the next-round prompt, improving the emotional fidelity with fine-grained content. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively generates high-quality images with the desired emotions, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in our custom dataset.

Accepted at AAAI 2026", "summary": "Discovering subgroups with the maximum average treatment effect is crucial for targeted decision making in domains such as precision medicine, public policy, and education. While most prior work is formulated in the potential outcome framework, the corresponding structural causal model (SCM) for this task has been largely overlooked. In practice, two approaches dominate. The first estimates pointwise conditional treatment effects and then fits a tree on those estimates, effectively turning subgroup estimation into the harder problem of accurate pointwise estimation. The second constructs decision trees or rule sets with ad-hoc 'causal' heuristics, typically without rigorous justification for why a given heuristic may be used or whether such heuristics are necessary at all. We address these issues by studying the problem directly under the SCM framework. Under the assumption of a partition-based model, we show that optimal subgroup discovery reduces to recovering the data-generating models and hence a standard supervised learning problem (regression or classification). This allows us to adopt any partition-based methods to learn the subgroup from data. We instantiate the approach with CART, arguably one of the most widely used tree-based methods, to learn the subgroup with maximum treatment effect. Finally, on a large collection of synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets, we compare our method against a wide range of baselines and find that our approach, which avoids such causal heuristics, more accurately identifies subgroups with maximum treatment effect.

While guidance-based methods in theory allow generic models to be used for inverse problems such as inpainting, in practice, their effectiveness is limited, leading to the necessity of specialized inpainting-specific models. In this work, we argue that the missing ingredient for training-free inpainting is the optimization (guidance) of the initial seed noise. We propose to optimize the initial seed noise to approximately match the unmasked parts of the data - with as few as a few tens of optimization steps. We then apply conventional training-free inpainting methods on top of our optimized initial seed noise. Critically, we propose two core ideas to effectively implement this idea: (i) to avoid the costly unrolling required to relate the initial noise and the generated outcome, we perform linear approximation; and (ii) to stabilize the optimization, we optimize the initial seed noise in the spectral domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on various inpainting tasks, outperforming the state of the art.

In these tasks, models solve the target problems by inferring compositional rules from context examples, which are composed of basic components structured by underlying rules. However, some of these tasks remain challenging for Transformers, which are not inherently designed to handle compositional tasks and offer limited structural inductive bias. In this work, inspired by the principle of sparse coding, we propose a reformulation of the attention to enhance its capability for compositional tasks. In sparse coding, data are represented as sparse combinations of dictionary atoms with coefficients that capture their compositional rules. Specifically, we reinterpret the attention block as a mapping of inputs into outputs through projections onto two sets of learned dictionary atoms: an encoding dictionary and a decoding dictionary. The encoding dictionary decomposes the input into a set of coefficients, which represent the compositional structure of the input. To enhance structured representations, we impose sparsity on these coefficients. The sparse coefficients are then used to linearly combine the decoding dictionary atoms to generate the output. Furthermore, to assist compositional generalization tasks, we propose estimating the coefficients of the target problem as a linear combination of the coefficients obtained from the context examples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the S-RAVEN and RAVEN datasets. For certain compositional generalization tasks, our method maintains performance even when standard Transformers fail, owing to its ability to learn and apply compositional rules.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u7f16\u7801\u539f\u7406\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u589e\u5f3aTransformer\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728S-RAVEN\u548cRAVEN\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7ec4\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u63a8\u65ad\u7ec4\u5408\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5757\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7\u7f16\u7801\u5b57\u5178\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u5b57\u5178\u7684\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5bf9\u7cfb\u6570\u65bd\u52a0\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u7cfb\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u76ee\u6807\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7cfb\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6807\u51c6Transformer\u5931\u6548\u65f6\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u7ec4\u5408\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6539\u8fdb\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3aTransformer\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u7ec4\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

This paper introduces a multimodal approach to VR gaze prediction that combines temporal gaze patterns, head movement data, and visual scene information. By leveraging a gated fusion mechanism with cross-modal attention, the approach learns to adaptively weight gaze history, head movement, and scene content based on contextual relevance. Evaluations using a dataset spanning 22 VR scenes with 5.3M gaze samples demonstrate improvements in predictive accuracy when combining modalities compared to using individual data streams alone. The results indicate that integrating past gaze trajectories with head orientation and scene content enhances prediction accuracy across 1-3 future frames. Cross-scene generalization testing shows consistent performance with 93.1% validation accuracy and temporal consistency in predicted gaze trajectories.

This limitation arises because VAE-based latent compression inherently discards subtle texture information, causing identity- and attribute-specific cues to vanish. Moreover, post-editing approaches that amplify local details based on existing methods often produce results inconsistent with the original image in terms of lighting, texture, or shape. To address this, we introduce \\ourMthd{}, a detail-aware refinement framework that performs two consecutive stages of reference-driven correction to enhance pixel-level consistency. We first adapt a single-image diffusion editor by fine-tuning it to jointly ingest the draft image and the reference image, enabling globally coherent refinement while maintaining structural fidelity. We then apply reinforcement learning to further strengthen localized editing capability, explicitly optimizing for detail accuracy and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \\ourMthd{} significantly improves reference alignment and fine-grained detail preservation, producing faithful and visually coherent edits that surpass both open-source and commercial models on challenging reference-guided restoration benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ec6\u8282\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4fee\u6b63\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec6\u8282\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eVAE\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u4f1a\u4e22\u5931\u7ec6\u5fae\u7eb9\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u7279\u5b9a\u7ebf\u7d22\u6d88\u5931\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u540e\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u653e\u5927\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u65f6\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u5149\u7167\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u6216\u5f62\u72b6\u4e0a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u53c2\u8003\u9a71\u52a8\u4fee\u6b63\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u5fae\u8c03\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u7f16\u8f91\u5668\u4f7f\u5176\u540c\u65f6\u8f93\u5165\u8349\u7a3f\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7cbe\u4fee\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u5e94\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5f3a\u5316\u5c40\u90e8\u7f16\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4f18\u5316\u7ec6\u8282\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u5f15\u5bfc\u6062\u590d\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u7559\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u5fe0\u5b9e\u4e14\u89c6\u89c9\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u611f\u77e5\u7cbe\u4fee\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u7559\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4fee\u6b63\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002"}}

While Graph Condensation (GC) offers a promising solution by synthesizing smaller datasets, existing methods falter in the multimodal setting. We identify a dual challenge causing this failure: (1) conflicting gradients arising from semantic misalignments between modalities, and (2) the GNN's message-passing architecture pathologically amplifying this gradient noise across the graph structure. To address this, we propose Structurally-Regularized Gradient Matching (SR-GM), a novel condensation framework tailored for multimodal graphs. SR-GM introduces two synergistic components: first, a gradient decoupling mechanism that resolves inter-modality conflicts at their source via orthogonal projection; and second, a structural damping regularizer that acts directly on the gradient field. By leveraging the graph's Dirichlet energy, this regularizer transforms the topology from a noise amplifier into a stabilizing force during optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SR-GM significantly improves accuracy and accelerates convergence compared to baseline methods.

Building on this observation, we collect LVLM-generated labels to train our CREward model that is applicable to both evaluation and generation of creative images.

While pseudo-labeling has become a dominant strategy in SSMLL, most existing methods assign equal weights to all pseudo-labels regardless of their quality, which can amplify the impact of noisy or uncertain predictions and degrade the overall performance. In this paper, we theoretically verify that the optimal weight for a pseudo-label should reflect its correctness likelihood. Empirically, we observe that on the same dataset, the correctness likelihood distribution of unlabeled data remains stable, even as the number of labeled training samples varies. Building on this insight, we propose Distribution-Calibrated Pseudo-labeling (DiCaP), a correctness-aware framework that estimates posterior precision to calibrate pseudo-label weights. We further introduce a dual-thresholding mechanism to separate confident and ambiguous regions: confident samples are pseudo-labeled and weighted accordingly, while ambiguous ones are explored by unsupervised contrastive learning.

In this paper, we propose a multi-context fusion Transformer (MFT) that leverages diverse numerical contextual attributes across four key dimensions, encompassing pedestrian behavior context, environmental context, pedestrian localization context and vehicle motion context, to enable accurate pedestrian intention prediction. MFT employs a progressive fusion strategy, where mutual intra-context attention enables reciprocal interactions within each context, thereby facilitating feature sequence fusion and yielding a context token as a context-specific representation. This is followed by mutual cross-context attention, which integrates features across contexts with a global CLS token serving as a compact multi-context representation. Finally, guided intra-context attention refines context tokens within each context through directed interactions, while guided cross-context attention strengthens the global CLS token to promote multi-context fusion via guided information propagation, yielding deeper and more efficient integration. Experimental results validate the superiority of MFT over state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracy rates of 73%, 93%, and 90% on the JAADbeh, JAADall, and PIE datasets, respectively.

However, effectively extracting and integrating complementary cues from different types of data remains one of the major challenges. This paper proposes an attention-guided cross-modal interaction Transformer (ACIT) for pedestrian crossing intention prediction. ACIT leverages six visual and motion modalities, which are grouped into three interaction pairs: (1) Global semantic map and global optical flow, (2) Local RGB image and local optical flow, and (3) Ego-vehicle speed and pedestrian's bounding box. Within each visual interaction pair, a dual-path attention mechanism enhances salient regions within the primary modality through intra-modal self-attention and facilitates deep interactions with the auxiliary modality (i.e., optical flow) via optical flow-guided attention. Within the motion interaction pair, cross-modal attention is employed to model the cross-modal dynamics, enabling the effective extraction of complementary motion features. Beyond pairwise interactions, a multi-modal feature fusion module further facilitates cross-modal interactions at each time step.

However, they often generalize worse than non-adaptive methods, such as SGD on classical architectures like CNNs. We identify a key cause of this performance gap: adaptivity in pre-conditioners, which limits the optimizer's ability to adapt to diverse optimization landscapes. To address this, we propose Anon (Adaptivity Non-restricted Optimizer with Novel convergence technique), a novel optimizer with continuously tunable adaptivity\n  , allowing it to interpolate between SGD-like and Adam-like behaviors and even extrapolate beyond both. To ensure convergence across the entire adaptivity spectrum, we introduce incremental delay update (IDU), a novel mechanism that is more flexible than AMSGrad's hard max-tracking strategy and enhances robustness to gradient noise. We theoretically establish convergence guarantees under both convex and non-convex settings. Empirically, Anon consistently outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers on representative image classification, diffusion, and language modeling tasks.

However, high-level reasoning in safety-critical scenarios, where avoiding one traffic risk can create another, remains a major challenge. Such reasoning is often infeasible with only a single front view and requires a comprehensive view of the environment, which we achieve through multi-view inputs. We define Safety-Critical Reasoning as a new task that leverages multi-view inputs to address this challenge. Then, we distill Safety-Critical Reasoning into two stages: first resolve the immediate risk, then mitigate the decision-induced downstream risks. To support this, we introduce WaymoQA, a dataset of 35,000 human-annotated question-answer pairs covering complex, high-risk driving scenarios. The dataset includes multiple-choice and open-ended formats across both image and video modalities.

Trained on extensive high-quality segmentation data, the segment anything model (SAM) has demonstrated remarkable universal segmentation capabilities, offering valuable support for OVSS. Although previous methods have made progress in leveraging SAM for OVSS, there are still some challenges: (1) SAM's tendency to over-segment and (2) hard combinations between fixed masks and labels. This paper introduces a novel mask-injected framework, SAM-MI, which effectively integrates SAM with OVSS models to address these challenges. Initially, SAM-MI employs a Text-guided Sparse Point Prompter to sample sparse prompts for SAM instead of previous dense grid-like prompts, thus significantly accelerating the mask generation process. The framework then introduces Shallow Mask Aggregation (SMAgg) to merge partial masks to mitigate the SAM's over-segmentation issue. Finally, Decoupled Mask Injection (DMI) incorporates SAM-generated masks for guidance at low-frequency and high-frequency separately, rather than directly combining them with labels.

We observe that although MLLMs can accurately extract visual semantics from visual tokens, they fail to fully leverage this advantage during subsequent inference. To address this limitation, we propose Vision-Guided Attention (VGA), a training-free method that first constructs precise visual grounding by exploiting the semantic content of visual tokens, and then uses this grounding to guide the model's focus toward relevant visual regions. In image captioning, VGA further refines this guidance dynamically during generation by suppressing regions that have already been described. In VGA, each token undergoes only a single forward pass, introducing a negligible latency overhead of just 4.36\\%. In addition, VGA is fully compatible with efficient attention implementations such as FlashAttention. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs and multiple hallucination benchmarks demonstrate that VGA achieves state-of-the-art dehallucination performance. Further analysis confirms that explicit visual guidance plays a crucial role in enhancing the visual understanding capabilities of MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "VGA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9token\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\u6784\u5efa\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u6ce8\u76f8\u5173\u89c6\u89c9\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11MLLMs\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "MLLMs\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u63d0\u53d6\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u540e\u7eed\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e00\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u6709\u9650\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u89c6\u89c9\u5f15\u5bfc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b(VGA)\uff1a1) \u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9token\u8bed\u4e49\u6784\u5efa\u7cbe\u786e\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\uff1b2) \u7528\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u6ce8\u76f8\u5173\u533a\u57df\uff1b3) \u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u6291\u5236\u5df2\u63cf\u8ff0\u533a\u57df\u3002\u4ec5\u9700\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5f00\u9500\u4ec54.36%\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cdMLLMs\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cVGA\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u53bb\u5e7b\u89c9\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u660e\u786e\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5f15\u5bfc\u5728\u589e\u5f3aMLLMs\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u4e2d\u8d77\u7740\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0cVGA\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u4e14\u517c\u5bb9\u9ad8\u6548\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002"}}

To address this problem, two main machine learning techniques are proposed and compared. Unlike existing methods, the proposed approaches are size independent and incorporate the Rate-Distortion (RD) costs of neighboring blocks as input features. The first method is a regression based technique that predicts normalized RD costs of a given Coding Unit (CU). As partitioning possesses the Markov property, the associated decision-making problem can be modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved by Reinforcement Learning (RL).

Romero", "Ming-Yu Liu", "Yongxin Chen"], "title": "MFM-point: Multi-scale Flow Matching for Point Cloud Generation", "comment": null, "summary": "In recent years, point cloud generation has gained significant attention in 3D generative modeling. Among existing approaches, point-based methods directly generate point clouds without relying on other representations such as latent features, meshes, or voxels. These methods offer low training cost and algorithmic simplicity, but often underperform compared to representation-based approaches. In this paper, we propose MFM-Point, a multi-scale Flow Matching framework for point cloud generation that substantially improves the scalability and performance of point-based methods while preserving their simplicity and efficiency. Our multi-scale generation algorithm adopts a coarse-to-fine generation paradigm, enhancing generation quality and scalability without incurring additional training or inference overhead. A key challenge in developing such a multi-scale framework lies in preserving the geometric structure of unordered point clouds while ensuring smooth and consistent distributional transitions across resolutions. To address this, we introduce a structured downsampling and upsampling strategy that preserves geometry and maintains alignment between coarse and fine resolutions. Our experimental results demonstrate that MFM-Point achieves best-in-class performance among point-based methods and challenges the best representation-based methods. In particular, MFM-point demonstrates strong results in multi-category and high-resolution generation tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "MFM-Point\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u70b9\u4e91\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8303\u5f0f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u70b9\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u70b9\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u70b9\u4e91\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\uff0c\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u5982\u57fa\u4e8e\u8868\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u4e8e\u70b9\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u4fdd\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u5206\u5e03\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "result": "MFM-Point\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u70b9\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u6700\u597d\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8868\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "MFM-Point\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u70b9\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u70b9\u4e91\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

While pre-trained transformer backbones have shown broad generalization capabilities in biological sequence modeling, their application to multi-omics integration remains underexplored. We present MoRE (Multi-Omics Representation Embedding), a framework that repurposes frozen pre-trained transformers to align heterogeneous assays into a shared latent space. Unlike purely generative approaches, MoRE employs a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy, prioritizing cross-sample and cross-modality alignment over simple sequence reconstruction. Specifically, MoRE attaches lightweight, modality-specific adapters and a task-adaptive fusion layer to the frozen backbone. It optimizes a masked modeling objective jointly with supervised contrastive and batch-invariant alignment losses, yielding structure-preserving embeddings that generalize across unseen cell types and platforms.

TTX contamination leads to food safety risks and economic losses, making early prediction of TTX contamination vital to the food industry and competent authorities. Recent studies have pointed to shallow habitats and water temperature as main drivers to TTX contamination in bivalve mollusks. However, the temporal relationships between abiotic factors, biotic factors, and TTX contamination remain unexplored.\n  We have developed an explainable, deep learning-based model to predict TTX contamination in the Dutch Zeeland estuary. Inputs for the model were meteorological and hydrological features; output was the presence or absence of TTX contamination.\n  Results showed that the time of sunrise, time of sunset, global radiation, water temperature, and chloride concentration contributed most to TTX contamination. Thus, the effective number of sun hours, represented by day length and global radiation, was an important driver for tetrodotoxin contamination in bivalve mollusks.\n  To conclude, our explainable deep learning model identified the aforementioned environmental factors (number of sun hours, global radiation, water temperature, and water chloride concentration) to be associated with tetrodotoxin contamination in bivalve mollusks; making our approach a valuable tool to mitigate marine toxin risks for food industry and competent authorities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u8377\u5170Zeeland\u6cb3\u53e3\u53cc\u58f3\u7c7b\u8f6f\u4f53\u52a8\u7269\u4e2d\u7684\u6cb3\u8c5a\u6bd2\u7d20\u6c61\u67d3\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65e5\u7167\u65f6\u957f\u3001\u5168\u7403\u8f90\u5c04\u3001\u6c34\u6e29\u548c\u6c2f\u79bb\u5b50\u6d53\u5ea6\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea2012\u5e74\u4ee5\u6765\uff0c\u6b27\u6d32\u6e29\u5e26\u6c34\u57df\u7684\u53cc\u58f3\u7c7b\u8f6f\u4f53\u52a8\u7269\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u6cb3\u8c5a\u6bd2\u7d20\u6c61\u67d3\uff0c\u8fd9\u5e26\u6765\u98df\u54c1\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4fdd\u969c\u98df\u54c1\u5de5\u4e1a\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u6c14\u8c61\u548c\u6c34\u6587\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u6cb3\u8c5a\u6bd2\u7d20\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6216\u7f3a\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u65e5\u51fa\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u65e5\u843d\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u5168\u7403\u8f90\u5c04\u3001\u6c34\u6e29\u548c\u6c2f\u79bb\u5b50\u6d53\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6cb3\u8c5a\u6bd2\u7d20\u6c61\u67d3\u8d21\u732e\u6700\u5927\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u65e5\u7167\u65f6\u957f\u662f\u91cd\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u7684\u73af\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u65e5\u7167\u65f6\u957f\u3001\u5168\u7403\u8f90\u5c04\u3001\u6c34\u6e29\u548c\u6c2f\u79bb\u5b50\u6d53\u5ea6\uff09\u4e0e\u53cc\u58f3\u7c7b\u8f6f\u4f53\u52a8\u7269\u4e2d\u7684\u6cb3\u8c5a\u6bd2\u7d20\u6c61\u67d3\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u662f\u51cf\u8f7b\u6d77\u6d0b\u6bd2\u7d20\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, balancing compression ratio and reconstruction quality is difficult because low-frequency and high-frequency components contribute differently at the same resolution. To address this, we propose FLaTEC, a frequency-aware compression model that enables the compression of a full scan with high compression ratios. Our approach introduces a frequency-aware mechanism that decouples low-frequency structures and high-frequency textures, while hybridizing latent triplanes as a compact proxy for point cloud. Specifically, we convert voxelized embeddings into triplane representations to reduce sparsity, computational cost, and storage requirements. We then devise a frequency-disentangling technique that extracts compact low-frequency content while collecting high-frequency details across scales. The decoupled low-frequency and high-frequency components are stored in binary format. During decoding, full-spectrum signals are progressively recovered via a modulation block. Additionally, to compensate for the loss of 3D correlation, we introduce an efficient frequency-based attention mechanism that fosters local connectivity and outputs arbitrary resolution points.

In this work, we present PRADA (Probability-Ratio-Based Attribution and Detection of Autoregressive-Generated Images), a simple and interpretable approach that can reliably detect AR-generated images and attribute them to their respective source model. The key idea is to inspect the ratio of a model's conditional and unconditional probability for the autoregressive token sequence representing a given image. Whenever an image is generated by a particular model, its probability ratio shows unique characteristics which are not present for images generated by other models or real images. We exploit these characteristics for threshold-based attribution and detection by calibrating a simple, model-specific score function. Our experimental evaluation shows that PRADA is highly effective against eight class-to-image and four text-to-image models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PRADA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u7387\u6bd4\u7387\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5f52\u56e0\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u5668\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u95e8\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fd9\u7c7b\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u67e5\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cftoken\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u6982\u7387\u548c\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u6982\u7387\u4e4b\u6bd4\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u6bd4\u7387\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u9608\u503c\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5f52\u56e0\u3002", "result": "PRADA\u5bf98\u4e2a\u7c7b\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u548c4\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "PRADA\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u6d4b\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5f52\u56e0\u5230\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

This observation allows us to disentangle two distinct mechanisms underlying oversquashing: (1) the bottleneck phenomenon, which can arise even in low-range settings, and (2) the vanishing gradient phenomenon, which is closely associated with long-range tasks.\n  We further show that the short-range bottleneck effect is not captured by existing explanations for oversquashing, and that adding virtual nodes does not resolve it.

Existing methods typically address this problem by aligning visual content with textual descriptions at the task and step levels to inject procedural semantics into video representations. However, due to their high level of abstraction, 'task' and 'step' descriptions fail to form a robust alignment with the concrete, observable details in visual data. To address this, we introduce 'states', i.e., textual snapshots of object configurations, as a visually-grounded semantic layer that anchors abstract procedures to what a model can actually see. We formalize this insight in a novel Task-Step-State (TSS) framework, where tasks are achieved via steps that drive transitions between observable states. To enforce this structure, we propose a progressive pre-training strategy that unfolds the TSS hierarchy, forcing the model to ground representations in states while associating them with steps and high-level tasks. Extensive experiments on the COIN and CrossTask datasets show that our method outperforms baseline models on multiple downstream tasks, including task recognition, step recognition, and next step prediction. Ablation studies show that introducing state supervision is a key driver of performance gains across all tasks. Additionally, our progressive pretraining strategy proves more effective than standard joint training, as it better enforces the intended hierarchical structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Task-Step-State (TSS)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u72b6\u6001\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\uff0c\u5c06\u62bd\u8c61\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e0e\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u7ec6\u8282\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7\u522b\u5bf9\u9f50\u89c6\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u62bd\u8c61\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u7ec6\u8282\u5f62\u6210\u7a33\u5065\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u72b6\u6001\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u5feb\u7167\uff0c\u6784\u5efaTSS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u9010\u6b65\u5c55\u5f00\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\u57fa\u7840\u8868\u793a\u5e76\u4e0e\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u5173\u8054\u3002", "result": "\u5728COIN\u548cCrossTask\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u6b65\u9aa4\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u72b6\u6001\u76d1\u7763\u662f\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u9884\u671f\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u72b6\u6001\u76d1\u7763\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u90fd\u662f\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

Chan"], "title": "Blind Adaptive Local Denoising for CEST Imaging", "comment": null, "summary": "Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) MRI enables molecular-level visualization of low-concentration metabolites by leveraging proton exchange dynamics. However, its clinical translation is hindered by inherent challenges: spatially varying noise arising from hardware limitations, and complex imaging protocols introduce heteroscedasticity in CEST data, perturbing the accuracy of quantitative contrast mapping such as amide proton transfer (APT) imaging. Traditional denoising methods are not designed for this complex noise and often alter the underlying information that is critical for biomedical analysis. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new Blind Adaptive Local Denoising (BALD) method. BALD exploits the self-similar nature of CEST data to derive an adaptive variance-stabilizing transform that equalizes the noise distributions across CEST pixels without prior knowledge of noise characteristics. Then, BALD performs two-stage denoising on a linear transformation of data to disentangle molecular signals from noise.

Typically framed as a PDE-constrained optimization problem, stellarator design is a time-consuming process that can take hours to solve on a computing cluster. Developing fast methods for designing stellarators is crucial for advancing fusion research. Given the recent development of large datasets of optimized stellarators, machine learning approaches have emerged as a potential candidate. Motivated by this, we present an open inverse problem to the machine learning community: to rapidly generate high-quality stellarator designs which have a set of desirable characteristics. As a case study in the problem space, we train a conditional diffusion model on data from the QUASR database to generate quasisymmetric stellarator designs with desirable characteristics (aspect ratio and mean rotational transform). The diffusion model is applied to design stellarators with characteristics not seen during training. We provide evaluation protocols and show that many of the generated stellarators exhibit solid performance: less than 5% deviation from quasisymmetry and the target characteristics. The modest deviation from quasisymmetry highlights an opportunity to reach the sub 1% target. Beyond the case study, we share multiple promising avenues for generative modeling to advance stellarator design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u7406\u60f3\u7279\u6027\u7684\u51c6\u5bf9\u79f0\u4eff\u661f\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u805a\u53d8\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6848\u4f8b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eff\u661f\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u8017\u8d39\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u800c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u4f18\u5316\u4eff\u661f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u805a\u53d8\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5728QUASR\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u7eb5\u6a2a\u6bd4\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u65cb\u8f6c\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u51c6\u5bf9\u79f0\u4eff\u661f\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u7279\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4eff\u661f\u5668\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\uff1a\u51c6\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u5c0f\u4e8e5%\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u6027\u5339\u914d\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u8fbe\u52301%\u4ee5\u4e0b\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4eff\u661f\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u805a\u53d8\u80fd\u6e90\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u7a0b\u3002"}}

Many VAD models work without supervision but are still able to provide visual explanations by highlighting the anomalous regions within an image. However, although these visual explanations can be helpful, they lack a direct and semantically meaningful interpretation for users. To address this limitation, we propose extending Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) to the VAD setting. By learning meaningful concepts, the network can provide human-interpretable descriptions of anomalies, offering a novel and more insightful way to explain them. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we develop a Concept Dataset to support research on CBMs for VAD; (ii) we improve the CBM architecture to generate both concept-based and visual explanations, bridging semantic and localization interpretability; and (iii) we introduce a pipeline for synthesizing artificial anomalies, preserving the VAD paradigm of minimizing dependence on rare anomalous samples. Our approach, Concept-Aware Visual Anomaly Detection (CONVAD), achieves performance comparable to classic VAD methods while providing richer, concept-driven explanations that enhance interpretability and trust in VAD systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u6982\u5ff5\u74f6\u9888\u6a21\u578b(CBMs)\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u89c6\u89c9\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b(VAD)\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCONVAD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5f02\u5e38\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfVAD\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u89c6\u89c9\u5f02\u5e38\u533a\u57df\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8ba9\u7528\u6237\u7406\u89e3\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u542b\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u6982\u5ff5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6539\u8fdbCBM\u67b6\u6784\u751f\u6210\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u53cc\u91cd\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4eba\u5de5\u5f02\u5e38\u5408\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u7f55\u89c1\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "CONVAD\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178VAD\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86VAD\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6982\u5ff5\u74f6\u9888\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347VAD\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u662fVAD\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, these systems rely on models whose decisions can be subtly perturbed, raising concerns for security and reliability in ubiquitous sensing. Quantifying and understanding the robustness of such models, defined as their ability to maintain accurate predictions under adversarial perturbations, is therefore critical before wireless sensing can be safely deployed in real-world environments.\n  This work presents a systematic evaluation of the robustness of CSI deep learning models under diverse threat models (white-box, black-box/transfer, and universal perturbations) and varying degrees of attack realism. We establish a framework to compare compact temporal autoencoder models with larger deep architectures across three public datasets, quantifying how model scale, training regime, and physical constraints influence robustness. Our experiments show that smaller models, while efficient and equally performant on clean data, are markedly less robust. We further confirm that physically realizable signal-space perturbations, designed to be feasible in real wireless channels, significantly reduce attack success compared to unconstrained feature-space attacks.

However, existing approaches often suffer from tight runtime coupling or depend on offline reward signals, resulting in substantial inference overhead or hindering end-to-end optimization. To overcome these limitations, we introduce WPT, a World-to-Policy Transfer training paradigm that enables online distillation under the guidance of an end-to-end world model. Specifically, we develop a trainable reward model that infuses world knowledge into a teacher policy by aligning candidate trajectories with the future dynamics predicted by the world model. Subsequently, we propose policy distillation and world reward distillation to transfer the teacher's reasoning ability into a lightweight student policy, enhancing planning performance while preserving real-time deployability. Extensive experiments on both open-loop and closed-loop benchmarks show that our WPT achieves state-of-the-art performance with a simple policy architecture: it attains a 0.11 collision rate (open-loop) and achieves a 79.23 driving score (closed-loop) surpassing both world-model-based and imitation-learning methods in accuracy and safety.

In this paper, we explore an early warning system for detection of forest fires. Due to the lack of sizeable datasets and models tuned for this task, existing methods suffer from missed detection. In this work, we first propose a dataset for early identification of forest fires through visual analysis. Unlike existing image corpuses that contain images of wide-spread fire, our dataset consists of multiple instances of smoke plumes and fire that indicates the initiation of fire.

As imaging volumes grow, scalable methods that can process entire lung volumes efficiently are essential to tap into the full potential of these large screening datasets.

We present LungEvaty, a fully transformer-based framework for predicting 1-6 year lung cancer risk from a single LDCT scan. The model operates on whole-lung inputs, learning directly from large-scale screening data to capture comprehensive anatomical and pathological cues relevant for malignancy risk. Using only imaging data and no region supervision, LungEvaty matches state-of-the-art performance, refinable by an optional Anatomically Informed Attention Guidance (AIAG) loss that encourages anatomically focused attention. In total, LungEvaty was trained on more than 90,000 CT scans, including over 28,000 for fine-tuning and 6,000 for evaluation.

We provide a detailed formulation of the proposed Attention Adversarial Dual AutoEncoder-based anomaly detection framework and show how the active learning loop iteratively enhances the model. The framework is evaluated on real-world imbalanced provenance trace databases produced by the DARPA Transparent Computing program, where APT-like attacks constitute as little as 0.004\\% of the data.

This article explains an integrated approach to the use of deep learning tools and attention mechanisms for automatic detection of cardiomegaly using X-ray images. The initiation of the project is grounded on a strong Data Collection phase and gathering the data of annotated X-ray images of various types. Then, while the Preprocessing module fine-tunes image quality, it is feasible to utilize the best out of the data quality in the proposed system. In our proposed system, the process is a CNN configuration leveraging the inception V3 model as one of the key blocks. Besides, we also employ a multilayer attention mechanism to enhance the strength. The most important feature of the method is the multi-head attention mechanism that can learn features automatically. By exact selective focusing on only some regions of input, the model can thus identify cardiomegaly in a sensitive manner. Attention rating is calculated, duplicated, and applied to enhance representation of main data, and therefore there is a successful diagnosis. The Evaluation stage will be extremely strict and it will thoroughly evaluate the model based on such measures as accuracy and precision.

Existing evaluations primarily assess unimodal, decontextualized question-answering, overlooking multi-agent decision-making environments such as Molecular Tumor Boards (MTBs). MTBs bring together diverse experts in oncology, where diagnostic and prognostic tasks require integrating heterogeneous data and evolving insights over time. Current benchmarks lack this longitudinal and multimodal complexity. We introduce MTBBench, an agentic benchmark simulating MTB-style decision-making through clinically challenging, multimodal, and longitudinal oncology questions. Ground truth annotations are validated by clinicians via a co-developed app, ensuring clinical relevance. We benchmark multiple open and closed-source LLMs and show that, even at scale, they lack reliability -- frequently hallucinating, struggling with reasoning from time-resolved data, and failing to reconcile conflicting evidence or different modalities. To address these limitations, MTBBench goes beyond benchmarking by providing an agentic framework with foundation model-based tools that enhance multi-modal and longitudinal reasoning, leading to task-level performance gains of up to 9.0% and 11.2%, respectively.

A Siamese encoder trained with a contrastive objective aligns source and target representations, increasing anomaly separability and mitigating feature drift.

We identify two failure modes: model-specific periodic content repetition and a universal quality degradation. Prior works attempt to solve repetition via positional encodings, overlooking quality degradation and achieving only limited extrapolation. In this paper, we revisit this challenge from a more fundamental view: attention maps, which directly govern how context influences outputs. We identify that both failure modes arise from a unified cause: attention dispersion, where tokens beyond the training window dilute learned attention patterns. This leads to quality degradation and repetition emerges as a special case when this dispersion becomes structured into periodic attention patterns, induced by harmonic properties of positional encodings. Building on this insight, we propose UltraViCo, a training-free, plug-and-play method that suppresses attention for tokens beyond the training window via a constant decay factor. By jointly addressing both failure modes, we outperform a broad set of baselines largely across models and extrapolation ratios, pushing the extrapolation limit from 2x to 4x. Remarkably, it improves Dynamic Degree and Imaging Quality by 233% and 40.5% over the previous best method at 4x extrapolation.

Compared with structural imaging (e.g., X-ray, CT, and MRI), functional PET poses distinct challenges: metabolic patterns vary with tracer physiology, and whole-body 3D contextual information is required rather than local-region interpretation. To advance PETRG, we propose PETRG-3D, an end-to-end 3D dual-branch framework that separately encodes PET and CT volumes and incorporates style-adaptive prompts to mitigate inter-hospital variability in reporting practices. We construct PETRG-Lym, a multi-center lymphoma dataset collected from four hospitals (824 reports w/ 245,509 paired PET/CT slices), and construct AutoPET-RG-Lym, a publicly accessible PETRG benchmark derived from open imaging data but equipped with new expert-written, clinically validated reports (135 cases). To assess clinical utility, we introduce PETRG-Score, a lymphoma-specific evaluation protocol that jointly measures metabolic and structural findings across curated anatomical regions. Experiments show that PETRG-3D substantially outperforms existing methods on both natural language metrics (e.g., +31.49\\% ROUGE-L) and clinical efficacy metrics (e.g., +8.18\\% PET-All), highlighting the benefits of volumetric dual-modality modeling and style-aware prompting.

For example, given a video sequence, such models are able to describe in detail objects, the surroundings and dynamic actions. In this study, we explored the extent to which these models ground their semantic understanding in the actual visual input. Specifically, given sequences of hands interacting with objects, we asked models when and where the interaction begins or ends. For this purpose, we introduce a first of its kind, large-scale dataset with more than 20K annotated interactions on videos from the Something-Something-V2 dataset. 250 AMTurk human annotators labeled core interaction events, particularly when and where objects and agents become attached ('contact') or detached ('release'). We asked two LMMs (Qwen-2.5VL and GPT-4o) to locate these events in short videos, each with a single event. The results show that although the models can reliably name the target objects, identify the action and provide coherent reasoning, they consistently fail to identify the frame where the interaction begins or ends and cannot localize the event within the scene.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) effectively capture local high frequency details, whereas Transformers and SSMs provide strong long range modeling capabilities but may cause structural information loss or ignore frequency characteristics that are crucial for compression. In this work we propose HCFSSNet, a Hybrid Convolution and Frequency State Space Network for LIC. HCFSSNet uses CNNs to extract local high frequency structures and introduces a Vision Frequency State Space (VFSS) block that models long range low frequency information. The VFSS block combines an Omni directional Neighborhood State Space (VONSS) module, which scans features horizontally, vertically and diagonally, with an Adaptive Frequency Modulation Module (AFMM) that applies content adaptive weighting of discrete cosine transform frequency components for more efficient bit allocation. To further reduce redundancy in the entropy model, we integrate AFMM with a Swin Transformer to form a Frequency Swin Transformer Attention Module (FSTAM) for frequency aware side information modeling. Experiments on the Kodak, Tecnick and CLIC Professional Validation datasets show that HCFSSNet achieves competitive rate distortion performance compared with recent SSM based codecs such as MambaIC, while using significantly fewer parameters. On Kodak, Tecnick and CLIC, HCFSSNet reduces BD rate over the VTM anchor by 18.06, 24.56 and 22.44 percent, respectively, providing an efficient and interpretable hybrid architecture for future learned image compression systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "HCFSSNet\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u5377\u79ef\u548c\u9891\u7387\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u3002\u5b83\u7ed3\u5408CNN\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u6355\u6349\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u4f4e\u9891\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\u4f18\u5316\u6bd4\u7279\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684RD\u6027\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u6216\u5ffd\u7565\u5bf9\u538b\u7f29\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u9891\u7387\u7279\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408CNN\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u6355\u6349\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHCFSSNet\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528CNN\u63d0\u53d6\u5c40\u90e8\u9ad8\u9891\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u9891\u7387\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4(VFSS)\u5757\u5efa\u6a21\u957f\u7a0b\u4f4e\u9891\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5168\u5411\u90bb\u57df\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4(VONSS)\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9891\u7387\u8c03\u5236\u6a21\u5757(AFMM)\uff1b\u96c6\u6210AFMM\u4e0eSwin Transformer\u5f62\u6210\u9891\u7387Swin Transformer\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757(FSTAM)\u7528\u4e8e\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u8fb9\u4fe1\u606f\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5728Kodak\u3001Tecnick\u548cCLIC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cHCFSSNet\u76f8\u6bd4VTM\u951a\u70b9\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4eBD\u738718.06%\u300124.56%\u548c22.44%\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u8fd1\u7684MambaIC\u7b49SSM\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u76f8\u6bd4\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u7387\u5931\u771f\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "HCFSSNet\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86CNN\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u6355\u6349\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6bd4\u7279\u5206\u914d\u3002"}}

While UFNO improves predictive accuracy over FNO, it inefficiently treats scalar inputs (e.g., temperature, injection rate) as spatially distributed fields by duplicating their values across the domain. This forces the model to process redundant constant signals within the frequency domain. Additionally, its standard loss function does not account for spatial variations in error sensitivity, limiting performance in regions of high physical importance. We introduce UFNO-FiLM, an enhanced architecture that incorporates two key innovations. First, we decouple scalar inputs from spatial features using a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer, allowing the model to modulate spatial feature maps without introducing constant signals into the Fourier transform. Second, we employ a spatially weighted loss function that prioritizes learning in critical regions.

This has led to a fragmented landscape: specialized, single-task models handle alpha but lack versatility, while unified multi-task frameworks are confined to the RGB domain. To bridge this critical gap, we propose OmniAlpha, the first unified, multi-task generative framework for sequence-to-sequence RGBA image generation and editing. Its architecture features MSRoPE-BiL, a novel RoPE method with a bi-directionally extendable layer axis for its Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, enabling the concurrent processing of multiple input and target RGBA layers. To power this framework, we introduce AlphaLayers, a new dataset of 1,000 high-quality, multi-layer triplets, built via a novel automated synthesis and filter pipeline. Jointly training OmniAlpha on this dataset across a comprehensive suite of 21 diverse tasks, extensive experiments demonstrate that our unified approach consistently outperforms strong, specialized baselines. Most notably, OmniAlpha achieves a dramatic 84.8% relative reduction in SAD for mask-free matting on AIM-500 and wins over 90% of human preferences in layer-conditioned completion.

However, most industrial deployments adopt a two-stage pipeline: GNNs are first pre-trained offline to generate node embeddings, which are then used as static features for downstream recommender systems. This decoupled paradigm leads to two key limitations: (1) high computational overhead, since large-scale GNN inference must be repeatedly executed to refresh embeddings; and (2) lack of joint optimization, as the gradient from the recommender system cannot directly influence the GNN learning process, causing the GNN to be suboptimally informative for the recommendation task. In this paper, we propose E2E-GRec, a novel end-to-end training framework that unifies GNN training with the recommender system. Our framework is characterized by three key components: (i) efficient subgraph sampling from a large-scale cross-domain heterogeneous graph to ensure training scalability and efficiency; (ii) a Graph Feature Auto-Encoder (GFAE) serving as an auxiliary self-supervised task to guide the GNN to learn structurally meaningful embeddings; and (iii) a two-level feature fusion mechanism combined with Gradnorm-based dynamic loss balancing, which stabilizes graph-aware multi-task end-to-end training. Extensive offline evaluations, online A/B tests (e.g., a +0.133% relative improvement in stay duration, a 0.3171% reduction in the average number of videos a user skips) on large-scale production data, together with theoretical analysis, demonstrate that E2E-GRec consistently surpasses traditional approaches, yielding significant gains across multiple recommendation metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86E2E-GRec\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06GNN\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5de5\u4e1a\u90e8\u7f72\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff1aGNN\u79bb\u7ebf\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u8282\u70b9\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u89e3\u8026\u8303\u5f0f\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4f7fGNN\u5bf9\u63a8\u8350\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "E2E-GRec\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a(i)\u4ece\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8de8\u57df\u5f02\u8d28\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u5b50\u56fe\u91c7\u6837\uff1b(ii)\u56fe\u7279\u5f81\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b(iii)\u4e24\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8eGradnorm\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u635f\u5931\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u5728\u7ebfA/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u5982\u505c\u7559\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u53470.133%\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u8df3\u8fc7\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u91cf\u51cf\u5c110.3171%\uff09\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0cE2E-GRec\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u8350\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "E2E-GRec\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

To address the challenge of modeling Alzheimers disease (AD) progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI) data, we propose a Riemannian manifold mapping, a Time-aware manifold Neural ordinary differential equation, and an Attention-based riemannian Gated recurrent unit (R-TNAG) framework. Our approach first projects features extracted from high-dimensional sMRI into a manifold space to preserve the intrinsic geometry of disease progression. On this representation, a time-aware Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (TNODE) models the continuous evolution of latent states between observations, while an Attention-based Riemannian Gated Recurrent Unit (ARGRU) adaptively integrates historical and current information to handle irregular intervals. This joint design improves temporal consistency and yields robust AD trajectory prediction under irregular sampling.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in both disease status prediction and cognitive score regression. Ablation studies verify the contributions of each module, highlighting their complementary roles in enhancing predictive accuracy. Moreover, the model exhibits stable performance across varying sequence lengths and missing data rates, indicating strong temporal generalizability.

Most existing models rely on fixed-scale structural priors, such as patch-based tokenization, fixed frequency transformations, or frozen backbone architectures. This often leads to over-regularization of temporal dynamics, which limits their ability to adaptively model the full spectrum of temporal variations and impairs their performance on unpredictable, Sudden, high-magnitude events. To address this, we introduce the Multi-scale Temporal Network (MSTN), a novel deep learning architecture founded on a hierarchical multi-scale and sequence modeling principle. The MSTN framework integrates: (i) a multi-scale convolutional encoder that constructs a hierarchical feature pyramid for local patterns (ii) a sequence modeling component for long-range temporal dependencies. We empirically validate this with BiLSTM and Transformer variants, establishing a flexible foundation for future architectural advancements. and (iii) a gated fusion mechanism augmented with squeeze-and-excitation (SE) and multi-head temporal attention (MHTA) for dynamic, context-aware feature integration. This design enables MSTN to adaptively model temporal patterns from milliseconds to long-range dependencies within a unified framework. Extensive evaluations across time-series long-horizon forecasting, imputation, classification and generalizability study demonstrate that MSTN achieves competitive state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, showing improvements over contemporary approaches including EMTSF, LLM4TS, HiMTM, TIME-LLM, MTST, SOFTS, iTransformer, TimesNet, and PatchTST.

Recent end-to-end systems and world-model-based planners predict rich multi-modal trajectories, but typically rely on handcrafted anchors or reinforcement learning to select a single best mode for training and control. This selection discards information about alternative futures and complicates optimization. We propose MAP-World, a prior-free multi-modal planning framework that couples masked action planning with a path-weighted world model. The Masked Action Planning (MAP) module treats future ego motion as masked sequence completion: past waypoints are encoded as visible tokens, future waypoints are represented as mask tokens, and a driving-intent path provides a coarse scaffold. A compact latent planning state is expanded into multiple trajectory queries with injected noise, yielding diverse, temporally consistent modes without anchor libraries or teacher policies. A lightweight world model then rolls out future BEV semantics conditioned on each candidate trajectory. During training, semantic losses are computed as an expectation over modes, using trajectory probabilities as discrete path weights, so the planner learns from the full distribution of plausible futures instead of a single selected path.

This is primarily due to the inherent lack of 3D ground truth trajectories and spin annotations for real-world video. To overcome this, we propose a novel two-stage pipeline that divides the problem into a front-end perception task and a back-end 2D-to-3D uplifting task. This separation allows us to train the front-end components with abundant 2D supervision from our newly created TTHQ dataset, while the back-end uplifting network is trained exclusively on physically-correct synthetic data. We specifically re-engineer the uplifting model to be robust to common real-world artifacts, such as missing detections and varying frame rates.

A key distinction between their analyses, however, lies in the geometries, e.g., smoothness notions, they rely on. In the convex setting, adaptive optimizers are governed by a stronger adaptive smoothness condition, while NSD relies on the standard notion of smoothness. We extend the theory of adaptive smoothness to the nonconvex setting and show that it precisely characterizes the convergence of adaptive optimizers. Moreover, we establish that adaptive smoothness enables acceleration of adaptive optimizers with Nesterov momentum in the convex setting, a guarantee unattainable under standard smoothness for certain non-Euclidean geometry. We further develop an analogous comparison for stochastic optimization by introducing adaptive gradient variance, which parallels adaptive smoothness and leads to dimension-free convergence guarantees that cannot be achieved under standard gradient variance for certain non-Euclidean geometry.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e0e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6700\u901f\u4e0b\u964d(NSD)\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5c06\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u975e\u51f8\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u5728\u51f8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0Nesterov\u52a8\u91cf\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\u6982\u5ff5\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u7ef4\u5ea6\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5728\u4ec5\u9002\u5e94\u5f53\u524d\u68af\u5ea6\u65f6\u4f1a\u9000\u5316\u4e3a\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6700\u901f\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f46\u4e24\u8005\u5206\u6790\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u53d7\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u800cNSD\u4f9d\u8d56\u6807\u51c6\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u975e\u51f8\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u6536\u655b\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u5728\u51f8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7814\u7a76Nesterov\u52a8\u91cf\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\u6982\u5ff5\u8fdb\u884c\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u80fd\u591f\u7cbe\u786e\u523b\u753b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u51f8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86Nesterov\u52a8\u91cf\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u6807\u51c6\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u975e\u6b27\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u7684\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u7ef4\u5ea6\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u975e\u6b27\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0b\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u52a0\u901f\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u548c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

The recently proposed SKEL model addresses this limitation by re-rigging SMPL with an anatomically accurate skeleton. However, estimating SKEL parameters directly remains challenging due to limited training data, perspective ambiguities, and the inherent complexity of human articulation. We introduce SKEL-CF, a coarse-to-fine framework for SKEL parameter estimation. SKEL-CF employs a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder predicts coarse camera and SKEL parameters, and the decoder progressively refines them in successive layers. To ensure anatomically consistent supervision, we convert the existing SMPL-based dataset 4DHuman into a SKEL-aligned version, 4DHuman-SKEL, providing high-quality training data for SKEL estimation. In addition, to mitigate depth and scale ambiguities, we explicitly incorporate camera modeling into the SKEL-CF pipeline and demonstrate its importance across diverse viewpoints. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed design. On the challenging MOYO dataset, SKEL-CF achieves 85.0 MPJPE / 51.4 PA-MPJPE, significantly outperforming the previous SKEL-based state-of-the-art HSMR (104.5 / 79.6). These results establish SKEL-CF as a scalable and anatomically faithful framework for human motion analysis, bridging the gap between computer vision and biomechanics.

During generation, we use cuboidal control domains of varying dimensionality, location, and shape to slice out relevant substructures. These local substructures are used to compute differentiable penalty functions that steer the sample towards target constraints. We control geometric features such as size, shape, and position through voxel-wise moments, while topological features such as connected components, loops, and voids are enforced through persistent homology. Lastly, we implement Anatomica for latent diffusion models, where neural field decoders partially extract substructures, enabling the efficient control of anatomical properties.

This critical oversight ignores the fact that real-world MLLMs inherently require such mechanisms to mitigate potential risks. In this work, we shift our focus to CVIT for safety-aligned MLLMs and observe that during continual adaptation, the model not only suffers from task forgetting but also exhibits degradation in its safety. Achieving a harmonious balance between safety and task performance remains a crucial challenge. To address this, we propose Harmonious Parameter Adaptation (HPA), a post-training framework composed of focusing-based parameter partition, harmoniously balanced parameter selection, and orthogonal parameter adjustment. Specifically, HPA partitions parameters into two types based on their focus on safety or task performance, and selects the focused ones to preserve from a balanced perspective. In addition, HPA imposes orthogonality constraints on parameter updates to further alleviate catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments on the CVIT benchmark and safety evaluation datasets demonstrate that HPA better maintains high safety and mitigates forgetting than existing baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faHPA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u89c6\u89c9\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u4e2d\u5e73\u8861\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u89c6\u89c9\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u672a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cMLLMs\u9700\u8981\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u6f5c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u5f53\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684MLLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u65f6\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u8fd8\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u548c\u8c10\u53c2\u6570\u9002\u5e94(HPA)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u5173\u6ce8\u5ea6\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5212\u5206\u3001\u548c\u8c10\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u6b63\u4ea4\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u3002\u5c06\u53c2\u6570\u6309\u5173\u6ce8\u5b89\u5168\u6216\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u5212\u5206\uff0c\u4ece\u5e73\u8861\u89c6\u89d2\u9009\u62e9\u9700\u8981\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u65bd\u52a0\u6b63\u4ea4\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "result": "\u5728CVIT\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHPA\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "HPA\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50MLLMs\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

ATOMs successfully delineate the attention patterns of an agent trained on each game variation, and that these differences in attention patterns translate into differences in the agent's behaviour. Through continuous monitoring of ATOMs during training, we observed that the agent's attention developed in phases, and that these phases were consistent across game variations.

The encoder/decoder pair and corresponding latent codes have largely been ignored by inversion techniques applied to latent space generative models, e.g., Latent Diffusion models (LDMs). In this work we describe two key findings: (1) The diffusion model exhibits non-uniform memorization across latent codes, tending to overfit samples located in high-distortion regions of the decoder pullback metric. (2) Even within a single latent code, different dimensions contribute unequally to memorization. We introduce a principled method to rank latent dimensions by their per-dimensional contribution to the decoder pullback metric, identifying those most responsible for memorization.

Existing anomaly detection benchmarks (e.g., MVTec-AD with 15 categories) cover only a narrow range of categories, limiting the evaluation of cross-context generalization and scalability. We introduce ADNet, a large-scale, multi-domain benchmark comprising 380 categories aggregated from 49 publicly available datasets across Electronics, Industry, Agrifood, Infrastructure, and Medical domains. The benchmark includes a total of 196,294 RGB images, consisting of 116,192 normal samples for training and 80,102 test images, of which 60,311 are anomalous. All images are standardized with MVTec-style pixel-level annotations and structured text descriptions spanning both spatial and visual attributes, enabling multimodal anomaly detection tasks. Extensive experiments reveal a clear scalability challenge: existing state-of-the-art methods achieve 90.6% I-AUROC in one-for-one settings but drop to 78.5% when scaling to all 380 categories in a multi-class setting. To address this, we propose Dinomaly-m, a context-guided Mixture-of-Experts extension of Dinomaly that expands decoder capacity without increasing inference cost. It achieves 83.2% I-AUROC and 93.1% P-AUROC, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches. ADNet is designed as a standardized and extensible benchmark, supporting the community in expanding anomaly detection datasets across diverse domains and providing a scalable foundation for future anomaly detection foundation models.

While event-based vision sensors offer microsecond resolution and sparse data streams, they have lacked fully integrated, low-power processing solutions capable of real-time inference. In this work, we present the first battery-powered, wearable pupil-center-tracking system with complete on-device integration, combining event-based sensing and neuromorphic processing on the commercially available Speck2f system-on-chip with lightweight coordinate decoding on a low-power microcontroller. Our solution features a novel uncertainty-quantifying spiking neural network with gated temporal decoding, optimized for strict memory and bandwidth constraints, complemented by systematic deployment mechanisms that bridge the reality gap.

(ii) The substantial storage costs of training a separate model for each setting in the case of multiple views hinder practical clinical applications. To address these issues, we elaborate an explicitly provable Lipschitz-constrained network, dubbed LipNet, and integrate an explicit prompt module to provide discriminative knowledge of different sparse sampling settings, enabling the treatment of multiple sparse view configurations within a single model. Furthermore, we develop a storage-saving deep unfolding framework for multiple-in-one SVCT reconstruction, termed PromptCT, which embeds LipNet as its prior network to ensure the convergence of its corresponding iterative algorithm. In simulated and real data experiments, PromptCT outperforms benchmark reconstruction algorithms in multiple-in-one SVCT reconstruction, achieving higher-quality reconstructions with lower storage costs. On the theoretical side, we explicitly demonstrate that LipNet satisfies boundary property, further proving its Lipschitz continuity and subsequently analyzing the convergence of the proposed iterative algorithms.

In this work, we introduce Exo2EgoSyn, an adaptation of WAN 2.2 that unlocks Exocentric-to-Egocentric(Exo2Ego) cross-view video synthesis. Our framework consists of three key modules. Ego-Exo View Alignment(EgoExo-Align) enforces latent-space alignment between exocentric and egocentric first-frame representations, reorienting the generative space from the given exo view toward the ego view. Multi-view Exocentric Video Conditioning (MultiExoCon) aggregates multi-view exocentric videos into a unified conditioning signal, extending WAN2.2 beyond its vanilla single-image or text conditioning. Furthermore, Pose-Aware Latent Injection (PoseInj) injects relative exo-to-ego camera pose information into the latent state, guiding geometry-aware synthesis across viewpoints. Together, these modules enable high-fidelity ego view video generation from third-person observations without retraining from scratch.

To address these challenges, we propose SFA, a training-free framework and the first Video-LLM-based method tailored for Video TextVQA, motivated by the human process of answering questions. By adaptively scanning video frames, selectively focusing on key regions, and directly amplifying them, SFA effectively guides the Video-LLM's attention toward essential cues, enabling it to generate more accurate answers. SFA achieves new state-of-the-art results across several public Video TextVQA datasets and surpasses previous methods by a substantial margin, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SFA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eVideo-LLM\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u6587\u672c\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u626b\u63cf\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5173\u6ce8\u5173\u952e\u533a\u57df\u5e76\u76f4\u63a5\u653e\u5927\u5b83\u4eec\u6765\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u6587\u672c\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u9762\u4e34\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u7684\u573a\u666f\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6765\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5fc5\u987b\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6587\u672c\u7ebf\u7d22\u5e76\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSFA\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u626b\u63cf\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5173\u6ce8\u5173\u952e\u533a\u57df\u3001\u76f4\u63a5\u653e\u5927\u8fd9\u4e9b\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6709\u6548\u5f15\u5bfcVideo-LLM\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u671d\u5411\u5173\u952e\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "result": "SFA\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u89c6\u9891\u6587\u672c\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "SFA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u6587\u672c\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3aVideo-LLM\u5728\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, existing models evaluate the quality of retrieval based on proximity, which cannot guarantee that the retrieved pattern has the strongest association with the query, failing correctness. We reframe this problem by proposing that a query is a generative variant of a stored memory pattern, and define a variant distribution to model this subtle context-dependent generative process. Consequently, correct retrieval should return the memory pattern with the maximum a posteriori probability of being the query's origin. This perspective reveals that an ideal similarity measure should approximate the likelihood of each stored pattern generating the query in accordance with variant distribution, which is impossible for fixed and pre-defined similarities used by existing associative memories. To this end, we develop adaptive similarity, a novel mechanism that learns to approximate this insightful but unknown likelihood from samples drawn from context, aiming for correct retrieval. We theoretically prove that our proposed adaptive similarity achieves optimal correct retrieval under three canonical and widely applicable types of variants: noisy, masked, and biased. We integrate this mechanism into a novel adaptive Hopfield network (A-Hop), and empirical results show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, including memory retrieval, tabular classification, image classification, and multiple instance learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u673a\u5236\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5173\u8054\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u7d22\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94Hopfield\u7f51\u7edc(A-Hop)\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5173\u8054\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u90bb\u8fd1\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u68c0\u7d22\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u68c0\u7d22\u5230\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u5177\u6709\u6700\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u6027\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u67e5\u8be2\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5b58\u50a8\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u751f\u6210\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53d8\u4f53\u5206\u5e03\u5efa\u6a21\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u673a\u5236\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u81ea\u9002\u5e94Hopfield\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u5178\u578b\u53d8\u4f53\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u6b63\u786e\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u8bb0\u5fc6\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u8868\u683c\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5173\u8054\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u667a\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The video-level graphs are then processed by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), transforming them into rich, context-aware embeddings for efficient processing.

Learning their governing dynamics remains a central challenge in scientific machine learning. Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) provides a simple, data-driven approximation, but practical use is limited by sparse/noisy observations from continuous fields, reliance on linear approximations, and the lack of principled uncertainty quantification. To address these issues, we introduce Stochastic NODE-DMD, a probabilistic extension of DMD that models continuous-time, nonlinear dynamics while remaining interpretable. Our approach enables continuous spatiotemporal reconstruction at arbitrary coordinates and quantifies predictive uncertainty. Across four benchmarks, a synthetic setting and three physics-based flows, it surpasses a baseline in reconstruction accuracy when trained from only 10% observation density. It further recovers the dynamical structure by aligning learned modes and continuous-time eigenvalues with ground truth. Finally, on datasets with multiple realizations, our method learns a calibrated distribution over latent dynamics that preserves ensemble variability rather than averaging across regimes.

Existing fully-supervised IML methods depend heavily on dense pixel-level mask annotations, which limits scalability to large datasets or real-world deployment.In contrast, the majority of existing weakly-supervised IML approaches are based on image-level labels, which greatly reduce annotation effort but typically lack precise spatial localization. To address this dilemma, we propose BoxPromptIML, a novel weakly-supervised IML framework that effectively balances annotation cost and localization performance. Specifically, we propose a coarse region annotation strategy, which can generate relatively accurate manipulation masks at lower cost. To improve model efficiency and facilitate deployment, we further design an efficient lightweight student model, which learns to perform fine-grained localization through knowledge distillation from a fixed teacher model based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Moreover, inspired by the human subconscious memory mechanism, our feature fusion module employs a dual-guidance strategy that actively contextualizes recalled prototypical patterns with real-time observational cues derived from the input. Instead of passive feature extraction, this strategy enables a dynamic process of knowledge recollection, where long-term memory is adapted to the specific context of the current image, significantly enhancing localization accuracy and robustness.

An LLM vs. Human Coding Tournament on Market-driven Strategic Planning", "comment": null, "summary": "The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized AI-assisted code generation. This rapid development of LLMs has outpaced our ability to properly benchmark them. Prevailing benchmarks emphasize unit-test pass rates and syntactic correctness. Such metrics understate the difficulty of many real-world problems that require planning, optimization, and strategic interaction. We introduce a multi-agent reasoning-driven benchmark based on a real-world logistics optimization problem (Auction, Pickup, and Delivery Problem) that couples competitive auctions with capacity-constrained routing. The benchmark requires building agents that can (i) bid strategically under uncertainty and (ii) optimize planners that deliver tasks while maximizing profit. We evaluate 40 LLM-coded agents (by a wide range of state-of-the-art LLMs under multiple prompting methodologies, including vibe coding) against 17 human-coded agents developed before the advent of LLMs. Our results over 12 double all-play-all tournaments and $\\sim 40$k matches demonstrate (i) a clear superiority of human(graduate students)-coded agents: the top 5 spots are consistently won by human-coded agents, (ii) the majority of LLM-coded agents (33 out of 40) are beaten by very simple baselines, and (iii) given the best human solution as an input and prompted to improve upon, the best performing LLM makes the solution significantly worse instead of improving it. Our results highlight a gap in LLMs' ability to produce code that works competitively in the real-world, and motivate new evaluations that emphasize reasoning-driven code synthesis in real-world scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7269\u6d41\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7f16\u5199\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u7ade\u4e89\u4e2d\u5168\u9762\u4f18\u4e8eLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u63ed\u793aLLM\u5728\u9700\u8981\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6218\u7565\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5f3a\u8c03\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7387\u548c\u8bed\u6cd5\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f4e\u4f30\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6218\u7565\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7269\u6d41\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u62cd\u5356\u3001\u53d6\u8d27\u548c\u914d\u9001\u95ee\u9898\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f3040\u4e2aLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u4e0e17\u4e2a\u4eba\u7c7b\u7f16\u5199\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u572812\u573a\u53cc\u5faa\u73af\u9526\u6807\u8d5b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u7f16\u5199\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u59cb\u7ec8\u5360\u636e\u524d5\u540d\uff1b40\u4e2aLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u4e2d\u670933\u4e2a\u88ab\u7b80\u5355\u57fa\u7ebf\u51fb\u8d25\uff1b\u5373\u4f7f\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u4f73\u4eba\u7c7b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0cLLM\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u53cd\u800c\u4f7f\u5176\u53d8\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5728\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5f3a\u8c03\u63a8\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5408\u6210\u3002"}}

However, re-running the same inference process twice often leads to different results due to benign numerical noise, making it difficult to distinguish legitimate variation from actual problems. To address this problem, we introduce Token-DiFR (Token-Divergence-From-Reference), a method for verifying inference outputs by comparing generated tokens against predictions made by a trusted reference implementation conditioned on the same random seed. Sampling seed synchronization tightly constrains valid outputs, leaving providers minimal room to deviate from correct inference, which allows output tokens themselves to serve as auditable evidence of correctness at zero additional cost to the provider. Token-DiFR reliably identifies sampling errors, simulated bugs, and model quantization, detecting 4-bit quantization with AUC $>$ 0.999 within 300 output tokens. For applications requiring sample-efficient forward-pass verification, we additionally introduce Activation-DiFR, a scheme that uses random orthogonal projections to compress activations into compact fingerprints for subsequent verification. Activation-DiFR detects 4-bit quantization with AUC $>$ 0.999 using just 2 output tokens, while reducing communication overhead by 25-75% relative to existing methods.

To address this issue, we propose CT-CIG, a Controllable Text-guided Camouflage Images Generation method that produces realistic and logically plausible camouflage images. Leveraging Large Visual Language Models (VLM), we design a Camouflage-Revealing Dialogue Mechanism (CRDM) to annotate existing camouflage datasets with high-quality text prompts. Subsequently, the constructed image-prompt pairs are utilized to finetune Stable Diffusion, incorporating a lightweight controller to guide the location and shape of camouflaged objects for enhanced camouflage scene fitness.

Recent advances in optimizers have improved convergence efficiency through momentum orthogonalization, but suffer from two key robustness limitations: dimensional fragility in orthogonalization precision and vulnerability to outlier-induced noise. To address these robustness challenges, we introduce ROOT, a Robust Orthogonalized Optimizer that enhances training stability through dual robustness mechanisms. First, we develop a dimension-robust orthogonalization scheme using adaptive Newton iterations with fine-grained coefficients tailored to specific matrix sizes, ensuring consistent precision across diverse architectural configurations. Second, we introduce an optimization-robust framework via proximal optimization that suppresses outlier noise while preserving meaningful gradient directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ROOT achieves significantly improved robustness, with faster convergence and superior final performance compared to both Muon and Adam-based optimizers, particularly in noisy and non-convex scenarios.

Our model's performance on the online validation set, evaluated via the Synapse platform, yielded a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.7064 and an F1-score of 0.7676. On the final test set, the model achieved an MCC of 0.6509 and an F1-score of 0.5330, which secured our team second place in the BraTS-Pathology 2025 Challenge. Our results establish a solid baseline for ViT-based histopathological analysis, and future efforts will focus on bridging the performance gap observed on the unseen validation data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eVision Transformer\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u80f6\u8d28\u6bcd\u7ec6\u80de\u7624\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5728BraTS-Path 2025\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u7b2c\u4e8c\u540d\u3002", "motivation": "\u80f6\u8d28\u6bcd\u7ec6\u80de\u7624\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u548c\u75c5\u7406\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u5168\u5207\u7247\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5ba2\u89c2\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684Vision Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u914d\u5907\u4e13\u7528\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5934\uff0c\u5728\u5b98\u65b9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ebf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97MCC 0.7064\u548cF1\u5206\u65700.7676\uff1b\u6700\u7ec8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97MCC 0.6509\u548cF1\u5206\u65700.5330\uff0c\u5728BraTS-Pathology 2025\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\u4e2d\u6392\u540d\u7b2c\u4e8c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8eViT\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c06\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u7f29\u5c0f\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

This process requires converting CAD geometry into machine-readable G-code through slicing and path planning. While each step is well established, dependence on CAD modeling remains a major bottleneck: constructing object-specific 3D geometry is slow and poorly suited to rapid prototyping. Even minor design variations typically necessitate manual updates in CAD software, making iteration time-consuming and difficult to scale. To address this limitation, we introduce Image2Gcode, an end-to-end data-driven framework that bypasses the CAD stage and generates printer-ready G-code directly from images and part drawings. Instead of relying on an explicit 3D model, a hand-drawn or captured 2D image serves as the sole input. The framework first extracts slice-wise structural cues from the image and then employs a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) over G-code sequences. Through iterative denoising, the model transforms Gaussian noise into executable print-move trajectories with corresponding extrusion parameters, establishing a direct mapping from visual input to native toolpaths. By producing structured G-code directly from 2D imagery, Image2Gcode eliminates the need for CAD or STL intermediates, lowering the entry barrier for additive manufacturing and accelerating the design-to-fabrication cycle. This approach supports on-demand prototyping from simple sketches or visual references and integrates with upstream 2D-to-3D reconstruction modules to enable an automated pipeline from concept to physical artifact.

However, existing methods struggle with controllability and fail to precisely manipulate the semantics of specific concepts in the image. We attribute this limitation to semantic entanglement in the patch-token representations on which adversarial attacks typically operate: global context aggregated by self-attention in the vision encoder dominates individual patch features, making them unreliable handles for precise local semantic manipulation. Our systematic investigation reveals a key insight: value features (V) computed within the transformer attention block serve as much more precise handles for manipulation. We show that V suppresses global-context channels, allowing it to retain high-entropy, disentangled local semantic information. Building on this discovery, we propose V-Attack, a novel method designed for precise local semantic attacks. V-Attack targets the value features and introduces two core components: (1) a Self-Value Enhancement module to refine V's intrinsic semantic richness, and (2) a Text-Guided Value Manipulation module that leverages text prompts to locate source concept and optimize it toward a target concept. By bypassing the entangled patch features, V-Attack achieves highly effective semantic control. Extensive experiments across diverse LVLMs, including LLaVA, InternVL, DeepseekVL and GPT-4o, show that V-Attack improves the attack success rate by an average of 36% over state-of-the-art methods, exposing critical vulnerabilities in modern visual-language understanding.

With 5 GPUs exploiting temporal parallelism, we achieve ~2x acceleration across all model scales: 1.3B models accelerate from 16 to 30 FPS, 14B models from 4.5 to 12.5 FPS. Beyond inference speed, Block Cascading eliminates overhead from KV-recaching (of ~200ms) during context switches for interactive generation. Extensive evaluations validated against multiple block-causal pipelines demonstrate no significant loss in generation quality when switching from block-causal to Block Cascading pipelines for inference.

These models are typically data-intensive, a challenge that becomes more pronounced when dealing with diverse and complex images. In this work, we propose HistoSpeckle-Net, a deep learning architecture designed to reconstruct structurally rich medical images from MMF speckles. To build a clinically relevant dataset, we develop an optical setup that couples laser light through a spatial light modulator (SLM) into an MMF, capturing output speckle patterns corresponding to input OrganAMNIST images. Unlike previous MMF imaging approaches, which have not considered the underlying statistics of speckles and reconstructed images, we introduce a distribution-aware learning strategy. We employ a histogram-based mutual information loss to enhance model robustness and reduce reliance on large datasets. Our model includes a histogram computation unit that estimates smooth marginal and joint histograms for calculating mutual information loss. It also incorporates a unique Three-Scale Feature Refinement Module, which leads to multiscale Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) loss computation. Together, these two loss functions enhance both the structural fidelity and statistical alignment of the reconstructed images. Our experiments on the complex OrganAMNIST dataset demonstrate that HistoSpeckle-Net achieves higher fidelity than baseline models such as U-Net and Pix2Pix. It gives superior performance even with limited training samples and across varying fiber bending conditions. By effectively reconstructing complex anatomical features with reduced data and under fiber perturbations, HistoSpeckle-Net brings MMF imaging closer to practical deployment in real-world clinical environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86HistoSpeckle-Net\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u591a\u6a21\u5149\u7ea4\u6563\u6591\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u611f\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u53cc\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MMF\u6210\u50cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6210\u50cf\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9002\u7528\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6837\u590d\u6742\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\u6311\u6218\u66f4\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5149\u5b66\u88c5\u7f6e\u6784\u5efa\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f4\u65b9\u56fe\u7684\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u548c\u4e09\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u7ec6\u5316\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6SSIM\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u590d\u6742OrganAMNIST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cHistoSpeckle-Net\u6bd4U-Net\u548cPix2Pix\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u5149\u7ea4\u5f2f\u66f2\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u91cd\u5efa\u590d\u6742\u89e3\u5256\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u5149\u7ea4\u6270\u52a8\u5f71\u54cd\uff0cHistoSpeckle-Net\u4f7fMMF\u6210\u50cf\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b9e\u9645\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

Pruning redundant vision tokens for high VLM inference efficiency has been continuously studied but all existing methods resort to indirect and non-guaranteed ways. We propose OC-VTP, a direct and guaranteed approach to select the most representative vision tokens for high-efficiency yet accuracy-preserving VLM inference. Our OC-VTP requires merely light-weight pre-training of a small object-centric vision token pruner, which can then be inserted into existing VLMs, without fine-tuning of any models on any datasets. It is gauranteed that the most representative vision tokens are kept by minimizing the error in reconstructing the original unpruned tokens from the selected ones. Across any vision pruning ratios, i.e., inference efficiency, our OC-VTP consistently helps mainstream VLMs to preserve the highest inference accuracy.

Real-world environments demand models capable of recognizing diverse, previously unseen objects, which remains a major limitation of closed-set methods. Existing open-vocabulary 3D detectors relax annotation requirements but still depend on training scenes, either as point clouds or images. We take this a step further by introducing Zoo3D, the first training-free 3D object detection framework. Our method constructs 3D bounding boxes via graph clustering of 2D instance masks, then assigns semantic labels using a novel open-vocabulary module with best-view selection and view-consensus mask generation. Zoo3D operates in two modes: the zero-shot Zoo3D$_0$, which requires no training at all, and the self-supervised Zoo3D$_1$, which refines 3D box prediction by training a class-agnostic detector on Zoo3D$_0$-generated pseudo labels. Furthermore, we extend Zoo3D beyond point clouds to work directly with posed and even unposed images. Across ScanNet200 and ARKitScenes benchmarks, both Zoo3D$_0$ and Zoo3D$_1$ achieve state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary 3D object detection. Remarkably, our zero-shot Zoo3D$_0$ outperforms all existing self-supervised methods, hence demonstrating the power and adaptability of training-free, off-the-shelf approaches for real-world 3D understanding.

Most current RL approaches depend on pre-trained preference models that output scalar rewards to approximate human preferences. However, these rewards often fail to capture human perception and are vulnerable to reward hacking, where higher scores do not correspond to better images. To address this, we introduce Adv-GRPO, an RL framework with an adversarial reward that iteratively updates both the reward model and the generator. The reward model is supervised using reference images as positive samples and can largely avoid being hacked. Unlike KL regularization that constrains parameter updates, our learned reward directly guides the generator through its visual outputs, leading to higher-quality images. Moreover, while optimizing existing reward functions can alleviate reward hacking, their inherent biases remain. For instance, PickScore may degrade image quality, whereas OCR-based rewards often reduce aesthetic fidelity. To address this, we take the image itself as a reward, using reference images and vision foundation models (e.g., DINO) to provide rich visual rewards. These dense visual signals, instead of a single scalar, lead to consistent gains across image quality, aesthetics, and task-specific metrics. Finally, we show that combining reference samples with foundation-model rewards enables distribution transfer and flexible style customization. In human evaluation, our method outperforms Flow-GRPO and SD3, achieving 70.0% and 72.4% win rates in image quality and aesthetics, respectively.

However, applying WA directly to multi-modal domain generalization (MMDG) is challenging: differences in optimization speed across modalities lead WA to overfit to faster-converging ones in early stages, suppressing the contribution of slower yet complementary modalities, thereby hindering effective modality fusion and skewing the loss surface toward sharper, less generalizable minima. To address this issue, we propose MBCD, a unified collaborative distillation framework that retains WA's flatness-inducing advantages while overcoming its shortcomings in multi-modal contexts. MBCD begins with adaptive modality dropout in the student model to curb early-stage bias toward dominant modalities. A gradient consistency constraint then aligns learning signals between uni-modal branches and the fused representation, encouraging coordinated and smoother optimization. Finally, a WA-based teacher conducts cross-modal distillation by transferring fused knowledge to each uni-modal branch, which strengthens cross-modal interactions and steer convergence toward flatter solutions.

Conventional classification approaches typically train models to directly predict class labels from input images, but this might lead to suboptimal performance in such scenarios. To address this issue, we propose Discrete Diffusion Classification Modeling (DiDiCM), a novel framework that leverages a diffusion-based procedure to model the posterior distribution of class labels conditioned on the input image. DiDiCM supports diffusion-based predictions either on class probabilities or on discrete class labels, providing flexibility in computation and memory trade-offs. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study demonstrating the superior performance of DiDiCM over standard classifiers, showing that a few diffusion iterations achieve higher classification accuracy on the ImageNet dataset compared to baselines, with accuracy gains increasing as the task becomes more challenging.

Most existing methods rely on unsupervised reconstruction using only normal data, often resulting in overfitting and poor detection of subtle defects. We propose a semi-supervised deep reinforcement learning framework that integrates a neural batch sampler, an autoencoder, and a predictor. The RL-based sampler adaptively selects informative patches by balancing exploration and exploitation through a composite reward. The autoencoder generates loss profiles highlighting abnormal regions, while the predictor performs segmentation in the loss-profile space.

Timestep distillation is a promising technique to accelerate generation, but it often requires extensive training and leads to image quality degradation. Furthermore, fine-tuning these distilled models for specific objectives, such as aesthetic appeal or user preference, using Reinforcement Learning (RL) is notoriously unstable and easily falls into reward hacking. In this work, we introduce Flash-DMD, a novel framework that enables fast convergence with distillation and joint RL-based refinement. Specifically, we first propose an efficient timestep-aware distillation strategy that significantly reduces training cost with enhanced realism, outperforming DMD2 with only $2.1\\%$ its training cost. Second, we introduce a joint training scheme where the model is fine-tuned with an RL objective while the timestep distillation training continues simultaneously. We demonstrate that the stable, well-defined loss from the ongoing distillation acts as a powerful regularizer, effectively stabilizing the RL training process and preventing policy collapse. Extensive experiments on score-based and flow matching models show that our proposed Flash-DMD not only converges significantly faster but also achieves state-of-the-art generation quality in the few-step sampling regime, outperforming existing methods in visual quality, human preference, and text-image alignment metrics.

The same holds for retrieving the image embedding (image retrieval task) given a text prompt. However, real-world scene images exhibit rich compositional structure involving multiple objects and actions. The latest methods in the CLIP-based literature improve class-level discrimination by mining harder negative image-text pairs and by refining permanent text prompts, often using LLMs. However, these improvements remain confined to predefined class lists and do not explicitly model relational or compositional structure. PyramidCLIP partially addresses this gap by aligning global and local visual features, yet it still lacks explicit modeling of inter-object relations. Hence, to further leverage this aspect for scene analysis, the proposed ScenarioCLIP model accepts input texts, grounded relations, and input images, along with focused regions highlighting relations. The proposed model is pretrained on curated scenario data, and finetuned for specialized downstream tasks, such as cross-modal retrieval and fine-grained visual understanding tasks. To address the lack of domain-specific datasets, we generate a novel dataset by extending image-text pairs from existing diverse indoor and outdoor scenario datasets that are publicly available. We used a pipeline of existing language models to ground action, object, and relations, filled by manual and automatic curation. We established a comprehensive benchmark for several scenario-based tasks and compared it with many baseline methods.

In this paper, we present the first work that studies the adaptability of State Space Models (SSMs) in DA PCC and find that directly applying SSMs to DA PCC will encounter several challenges: directly serializing 3D point clouds into 1D sequences often disrupts the spatial topology and local geometric features of the target domain. Besides, the overlook of designs in the learning domain-agnostic representations hinders the adaptation performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, DAPointMamba for DA PCC, that exhibits strong adaptability across domains and has the advantages of global receptive fields and efficient linear complexity. It has three novel modules. In particular, Cross-Domain Patch-Level Scanning introduces patch-level geometric correspondences, enabling effective local alignment. Cross-Domain Spatial SSM Alignment further strengthens spatial consistency by modulating patch features based on cross-domain similarity, effectively mitigating fine-grained structural discrepancies. Cross-Domain Channel SSM Alignment actively addresses global semantic gaps by interleaving and aligning feature channels. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our DAPointMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods with less computational complexity and inference latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DAPointMamba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u70b9\u4e91\u8865\u5168\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528SSM\u65f6\u7834\u574f\u7a7a\u95f4\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u5ffd\u7565\u9886\u57df\u65e0\u5173\u8868\u793a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u70b9\u4e91\u8865\u5168\u4e2d\u8981\u4e48\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u56e0\u4f7f\u7528CNN\u6216\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u800c\u5177\u6709\u4e8c\u6b21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528SSM\u4f1a\u7834\u574f3D\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e14\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u65e0\u5173\u8868\u793a\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDAPointMamba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u8de8\u57df\u8865\u4e01\u7ea7\u626b\u63cf\u5f15\u5165\u8865\u4e01\u7ea7\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c40\u90e8\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u8de8\u57df\u7a7a\u95f4SSM\u5bf9\u9f50\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u57df\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8c03\u5236\u8865\u4e01\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u8de8\u57df\u901a\u9053SSM\u5bf9\u9f50\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u9519\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7279\u5f81\u901a\u9053\u89e3\u51b3\u5168\u5c40\u8bed\u4e49\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDAPointMamba\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DAPointMamba\u5728\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u70b9\u4e91\u8865\u5168\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5168\u5c40\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Inspired by the success of integrating detection priors and by the key insight that MOTR-like models are secretly strong detection models, we introduce SelfMOTR, a novel tracking transformer that relies on self-generated detection priors. Through extensive analysis and ablation studies, we uncover and demonstrate the hidden detection capabilities of MOTR-like models, and present a practical set of tools for leveraging them effectively.

Garcia-Peraza-Herrera"], "title": "Back to the Feature: Explaining Video Classifiers with Video Counterfactual Explanations", "comment": null, "summary": "Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) are minimal and semantically meaningful modifications of the input of a model that alter the model predictions. They highlight the decisive features the model relies on, providing contrastive interpretations for classifiers. State-of-the-art visual counterfactual explanation methods are designed to explain image classifiers. The generation of CFEs for video classifiers remains largely underexplored. For the counterfactual videos to be useful, they have to be physically plausible, temporally coherent, and exhibit smooth motion trajectories. Existing CFE image-based methods, designed to explain image classifiers, lack the capacity to generate temporally coherent, smooth and physically plausible video CFEs. To address this, we propose Back To The Feature (BTTF), an optimization framework that generates video CFEs. Our method introduces two novel features, 1) an optimization scheme to retrieve the initial latent noise conditioned by the first frame of the input video, 2) a two-stage optimization strategy to enable the search for counterfactual videos in the vicinity of the input video.

To accelerate convergence, we also introduce a progressive optimization strategy that incrementally increases the number of denoising steps.

Two time-series models were trained using bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) and transformer architectures. The dataset consisted of 3D full-body plug-in gait dynamic coordinates from 20 normal-weight healthy male individuals each performing 204 load-reaching tasks from different load positions while adapting various lifting and handling techniques. The model inputs consisted of the 3D position of the hand-load position, lifting (stoop, full-squat and semi-squat) and handling (one- and two-handed) techniques, body weight and height, and the 3D coordinate data of the body posture from the first 25% of the task duration. These inputs were used by the models to predict body coordinates during the remaining 75% of the task period. Moreover, a novel method was proposed to improve the accuracy of the previous and present posture prediction networks by enforcing constant body segment lengths through the optimization of a new cost function. The results indicated that the new cost function decreased the prediction error of the models by approximately 8% and 21% for the arm and leg models, respectively. We indicated that utilizing the transformer architecture, with a root-mean-square-error of 47.0 mm, exhibited ~58% more accurate long-term performance than the BLSTM-based model.

To overcome this, we propose CrossEarth-Gate, which introduces two primary contributions. First, we establish a comprehensive RS module toolbox to address multifaceted domain gaps, comprising spatial, semantic, and frequency modules. Second, we develop a Fisher-guided adaptive selection mechanism that operates on this toolbox. This selection is guided by Fisher Information to quantify each module's importance by measuring its contribution to the task-specific gradient flow. It dynamically activates only the most critical modules at the appropriate layers, guiding the gradient flow to maximize adaptation effectiveness and efficiency.

Most previous methods rely solely on mask supervision, which effectively guides spatial localization but provides limited constraints on the temporal semantic transitions. Consequently, they often produce spatially coherent predictions while still suffering from unresolved semantic inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we propose TaCo, a spatio-temporal semantic consistent network, which enriches the existing mask-supervised framework with a spatio-temporal semantic joint constraint. TaCo conceptualizes change as a semantic transition between bi-temporal states, in which one temporal feature representation can be derived from the other via dedicated transition features. To realize this, we introduce a Text-guided Transition Generator that integrates textual semantics with bi-temporal visual features to construct the cross-temporal transition features. In addition, we propose a spatio-temporal semantic joint constraint consisting of bi-temporal reconstruct constraints and a transition constraint: the former enforces alignment between reconstructed and original features, while the latter enhances discrimination for changes.

However, when applied to image-to-image translation, they still depend on costly multi-step denoising, hindering real-time applications. Although the recent adversarial training paradigm, CycleGAN-Turbo, works in pretrained diffusion models for one-step image translation, we find that directly applying it to RF models leads to severe convergence issues. In this paper, we analyze these challenges and propose TReFT, a novel method to Tame Rectified Flow models for one-step image Translation. Unlike previous works, TReFT directly uses the velocity predicted by pretrained DiT or UNet as output-a simple yet effective design that tackles the convergence issues under adversarial training with one-step inference. This design is mainly motivated by a novel observation that, near the end of the denoising process, the velocity predicted by pretrained RF models converges to the vector from origin to the final clean image, a property we further justify through theoretical analysis. When applying TReFT to large pretrained RF models such as SD3.5 and FLUX, we introduce memory-efficient latent cycle-consistency and identity losses during training, as well as lightweight architectural simplifications for faster inference.

While deep learning-based encoder-decoder frameworks have advanced the field, their static pattern learning suffers from pattern drift across diverse scenarios (\\emph{e.g.}, day/night variations, sky/maritime/ground domains), limiting robustness. To address this, we propose IrisNet, a novel meta-learned framework that dynamically adapts detection strategies to the input infrared image status. Our approach establishes a dynamic mapping between infrared image features and entire decoder parameters via an image-to-decoder transformer. More concretely, we represent the parameterized decoder as a structured 2D tensor preserving hierarchical layer correlations and enable the transformer to model inter-layer dependencies through self-attention while generating adaptive decoding patterns via cross-attention. To further enhance the perception ability of infrared images, we integrate high-frequency components to supplement target-position and scene-edge information.

Recent research has explored motion controllability as a means to enhance text-to-video generation or image animation; however, we identify precise motion control as a promising yet under-explored paradigm for editing existing videos. In this work, we propose modifying video motion by directly editing sparse trajectories extracted from the input. We term the deviation between input and output trajectories a \"motion edit\" and demonstrate that this representation, when coupled with a generative backbone, enables powerful video editing capabilities. To achieve this, we introduce a pipeline for generating \"motion counterfactuals\", video pairs that share identical content but distinct motion, and we fine-tune a motion-conditioned video diffusion architecture on this dataset. Our approach allows for edits that start at any timestamp and propagate naturally. In a four-way head-to-head user study, our model achieves over 65 percent preference against prior work.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising path to overcome these limitations, yet its success in autonomous driving has been elusive. We identify a fundamental flaw hindering this progress: a deep seated optimistic bias in the world models used for RL. To address this, we introduce a framework for post-training policy refinement built around an Impartial World Model. Our primary contribution is to teach this model to be honest about danger. We achieve this with a novel data synthesis pipeline, Counterfactual Synthesis, which systematically generates a rich curriculum of plausible collisions and off-road events. This transforms the model from a passive scene completer into a veridical forecaster that remains faithful to the causal link between actions and outcomes. We then integrate this Impartial World Model into our closed-loop RL framework, where it serves as an internal critic. During refinement, the agent queries the critic to ``dream\" of the outcomes for candidate actions. We demonstrate through extensive experiments, including on a new Risk Foreseeing Benchmark, that our model significantly outperforms baselines in predicting failures. Consequently, when used as a critic, it enables a substantial reduction in safety violations in challenging simulations, proving that teaching a model to dream of danger is a critical step towards building truly safe and intelligent autonomous agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u516c\u6b63\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u78b0\u649e\u548c\u504f\u79bb\u9053\u8def\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u5371\u9669\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\u3002", "motivation": "\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u5904\u7406\u957f\u5c3e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65b9\u9762\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u7136\u6709\u671b\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e50\u89c2\u504f\u89c1\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u6210\u529f\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u516c\u6b63\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u78b0\u649e\u548c\u504f\u79bb\u9053\u8def\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u88ab\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u8865\u5168\u5668\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u5176\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u95ed\u73af\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5185\u90e8\u8bc4\u5224\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u62ec\u65b0\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u89c1\u57fa\u51c6\u5728\u5185\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u5931\u8d25\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\u7684\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6559\u4f1a\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u89c1\u5371\u9669\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u771f\u6b63\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u516c\u6b63\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

Open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD) addresses this limitation but remains underexplored in medical imaging due to dataset scarcity and weak text-image alignment. To bridge this gap, we introduce MedROV, the first Real-time Open Vocabulary detection model for medical imaging. To enable open-vocabulary learning, we curate a large-scale dataset, Omnis, with 600K detection samples across nine imaging modalities and introduce a pseudo-labeling strategy to handle missing annotations from multi-source datasets. Additionally, we enhance generalization by incorporating knowledge from a large pre-trained foundation model. By leveraging contrastive learning and cross-modal representations, MedROV effectively detects both known and novel structures. Experimental results demonstrate that MedROV outperforms the previous state-of-the-art foundation model for medical image detection with an average absolute improvement of 40 mAP50, and surpasses closed-set detectors by more than 3 mAP50, while running at 70 FPS, setting a new benchmark in medical detection.

Yet in the video generation domain, where spatiotemporal complexity and computational cost are substantially higher, state-of-the-art systems almost exclusively rely on diffusion-based models. In this work, we revisit this design space by presenting STARFlow-V, a normalizing flow-based video generator with substantial benefits such as end-to-end learning, robust causal prediction, and native likelihood estimation. Building upon the recently proposed STARFlow, STARFlow-V operates in the spatiotemporal latent space with a global-local architecture which restricts causal dependencies to a global latent space while preserving rich local within-frame interactions. This eases error accumulation over time, a common pitfall of standard autoregressive diffusion model generation. Additionally, we propose flow-score matching, which equips the model with a light-weight causal denoiser to improve the video generation consistency in an autoregressive fashion. To improve the sampling efficiency, STARFlow-V employs a video-aware Jacobi iteration scheme that recasts inner updates as parallelizable iterations without breaking causality. Thanks to the invertible structure, the same model can natively support text-to-video, image-to-video as well as video-to-video generation tasks. Empirically, STARFlow-V achieves strong visual fidelity and temporal consistency with practical sampling throughput relative to diffusion-based baselines. These results present the first evidence, to our knowledge, that NFs are capable of high-quality autoregressive video generation, establishing them as a promising research direction for building world models.

Identifying and distinguishing dance genres based on motion data is a complex problem in human activity recognition, as many styles share similar poses, gestures, and temporal motion patterns. This work presents a lightweight framework for classifying dance styles that determines motion characteristics based on pose estimates extracted from videos. We propose temporal-spatial descriptors inspired by Laban Movement Analysis. These features capture local joint dynamics such as velocity, acceleration, and angular movement of the upper body, enabling a structured representation of spatial coordination. To further encode rhythmic and periodic aspects of movement, we integrate Fast Fourier Transform features that characterize movement patterns in the frequency domain. The proposed approach achieves robust classification of different dance styles with low computational effort, as complex model architectures are not required, and shows that interpretable motion representations can effectively capture stylistic nuances.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u821e\u8e48\u98ce\u683c\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53d7\u62c9\u73ed\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u6355\u6349\u821e\u8e48\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5173\u8282\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u8282\u594f\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u821e\u8e48\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u6587\u5316\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u533a\u5206\u821e\u8e48\u7c7b\u578b\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8bb8\u591a\u98ce\u683c\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u59ff\u52bf\u3001\u624b\u52bf\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53d7\u62c9\u73ed\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u6355\u6349\u5c40\u90e8\u5173\u8282\u52a8\u6001\uff08\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u4e0a\u80a2\u89d2\u5ea6\u8fd0\u52a8\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u5feb\u901f\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u7f16\u7801\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u8282\u594f\u548c\u5468\u671f\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u821e\u8e48\u98ce\u683c\u8fdb\u884c\u7a33\u5065\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u793a\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u98ce\u683c\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u522b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u548c\u9891\u57df\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u821e\u8e48\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u793a\u5728\u6355\u6349\u98ce\u683c\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Submitted to IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV) 2026 for possible publication", "summary": "3D reconstruction for Digital Twins often relies on LiDAR-based methods, which provide accurate geometry but lack the semantics and textures naturally captured by cameras. Traditional LiDAR-camera fusion approaches require complex calibration and still struggle with certain materials like glass, which are visible in images but poorly represented in point clouds. We propose a camera-only pipeline that reconstructs scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting from multi-view images, extracts semantic material masks via vision models, converts Gaussian representations to mesh surfaces with projected material labels, and assigns physics-based material properties for accurate sensor simulation in modern graphics engines and simulators. This approach combines photorealistic reconstruction with physics-based material assignment, providing sensor simulation fidelity comparable to LiDAR-camera fusion while eliminating hardware complexity and calibration requirements.

Conventional loss functions often rely solely on pixel-wise overlap, overlooking the geometric and physical consistency of vascular boundaries, which can lead to fragmented or unstable vessel predictions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel \\textit{Physics-Informed Loss} (PIL) that models the interaction between the predicted and ground-truth boundaries as an elastic process inspired by dislocation theory in materials physics. This formulation introduces a physics-based regularization term that enforces smooth contour evolution and structural consistency, allowing the network to better capture fine vascular geometry. The proposed loss is integrated into several segmentation architectures, including U-Net, U-Net++, SegFormer, and MedFormer, and evaluated on two public benchmarks: DIAS and DSCA. Experimental results demonstrate that PIL consistently outperforms conventional loss functions such as Cross-Entropy, Dice, Active Contour, and Surface losses, achieving superior sensitivity, F1 score, and boundary coherence. These findings confirm that the incorporation of physics-based boundary interactions into deep neural networks improves both the precision and robustness of vascular segmentation in dynamic angiographic imaging.

However, prior approaches to visual search are limited to a static image, neglecting the physical embodiment and its interaction with the 3D world. How can we develop embodied visual search agents as efficient as humans while bypassing the constraints imposed by real-world hardware? To this end, we propose humanoid visual search where a humanoid agent actively rotates its head to search for objects or paths in an immersive world represented by a 360\u00b0 panoramic image. To study visual search in visually-crowded real-world scenarios, we build H* Bench, a new benchmark that moves beyond household scenes to challenging in-the-wild scenes that necessitate advanced visual-spatial reasoning capabilities, such as transportation hubs, large-scale retail spaces, urban streets, and public institutions. Our experiments first reveal that even top-tier proprietary models falter, achieving only ~30% success in object and path search. We then use post-training techniques to enhance the open-source Qwen2.5-VL, increasing its success rate by over threefold for both object search (14.83% to 47.38%) and path search (6.44% to 24.94%). Notably, the lower ceiling of path search reveals its inherent difficulty, which we attribute to the demand for sophisticated spatial commonsense.

However, these technologies raise concerns about potential malicious manipulation of 3D content. To avoid such malicious applications, localizing tampered regions becomes crucial. In this paper, we propose GS-Checker, a novel method for locating tampered areas in 3DGS models. Our approach integrates a 3D tampering attribute into the 3D Gaussian parameters to indicate whether the Gaussian has been tampered. Additionally, we design a 3D contrastive mechanism by comparing the similarity of key attributes between 3D Gaussians to seek tampering cues at 3D level.

Existing methods either require tedious manual efforts, lack generalization to in-the-wild data, or are constrained by the limited expressiveness of 3D Morphable Models. To address these limitations, we propose VGGTFace, an automatic approach that innovatively applies the 3D foundation model, \\emph{i.e.} VGGT, for topologically consistent facial geometry reconstruction from in-the-wild multi-view images captured by everyday users. Our key insight is that, by leveraging VGGT, our method naturally inherits strong generalization ability and expressive power from its large-scale training and point map representation. However, it is unclear how to reconstruct a topologically consistent mesh from VGGT, as the topology information is missing in its prediction. To this end, we augment VGGT with Pixel3DMM for injecting topology information via pixel-aligned UV values. In this manner, we convert the pixel-aligned point map of VGGT to a point cloud with topology. Tailored to this point cloud with known topology, we propose a novel Topology-Aware Bundle Adjustment strategy to fuse them, where we construct a Laplacian energy for the Bundle Adjustment objective. Our method achieves high-quality reconstruction in 10 seconds for 16 views on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090.

To address this limitation, we analyze the DiTs' feature dynamics and find the features of the final transformer layer (top-block) exhibit strong temporal consistency and rich semantic abstraction. Based on this insight, we propose FREE, a novel framework that employs a lightweight drafter to perform feature-level autoregression with parallel verification, guaranteeing lossless acceleration with theoretical and empirical support. Meanwhile, prediction variance (uncertainty) of DiTs naturally increases in later denoising steps, reducing acceptance rates under speculative sampling. To mitigate this effect, we further introduce an uncertainty-guided relaxation strategy, forming FREE (relax), which dynamically adjusts the acceptance probability in response to uncertainty levels.

Given the ID images of multiple individuals, its purpose is to generate a customized image that seamlessly integrates them while preserving their respective identities. Compared to single-ID customization, multi-ID customization is much more difficult and poses two major challenges. First, since the multi-ID customization model is trained to reconstruct an image from the cropped person regions, it often encounters the copy-paste issue during inference, leading to lower quality. Second, the model also suffers from inferior text controllability. The generated result simply combines multiple persons into one image, regardless of whether it is aligned with the input text. In this work, we propose MultiID to tackle this challenging task in a training-free manner. Since the existing single-ID customization models have less copy-paste issue, our key idea is to adapt these models to achieve multi-ID customization. To this end, we present an ID-decoupled cross-attention mechanism, injecting distinct ID embeddings into the corresponding image regions and thus generating multi-ID outputs. To enhance the generation controllability, we introduce three critical strategies, namely the local prompt, depth-guided spatial control, and extended self-attention, making the results more consistent with the text prompts and ID images. We also carefully build a benchmark, called IDBench, for evaluation.

The Consistency Model (CM), as a trajectory-based framework, demonstrates significant potential due to its strong theoretical foundation and high-quality few-step generation. Nevertheless, current continuous-time consistency distillation methods still rely heavily on training data and computational resources, hindering their deployment in resource-constrained scenarios and limiting their scalability to diverse domains. To address this issue, we propose Trajectory-Backward Consistency Model (TBCM), which eliminates the dependence on external training data by extracting latent representations directly from the teacher model's generation trajectory. Unlike conventional methods that require VAE encoding and large-scale datasets, our self-contained distillation paradigm significantly improves both efficiency and simplicity. Moreover, the trajectory-extracted samples naturally bridge the distribution gap between training and inference, thereby enabling more effective knowledge transfer. Empirically, TBCM achieves 6.52 FID and 28.08 CLIP scores on MJHQ-30k under one-step generation, while reducing training time by approximately 40% compared to Sana-Sprint and saving a substantial amount of GPU memory, demonstrating superior efficiency without sacrificing quality. We further reveal the diffusion-generation space discrepancy in continuous-time consistency distillation and analyze how sampling strategies affect distillation performance, offering insights for future distillation research.

However, existing methods struggle to balance the creative flexibility offered by text-based generation with the object-level editability enabled by explicit structural representations. We introduce MajutsuCity, a natural language-driven and aesthetically adaptive framework for synthesizing structurally consistent and stylistically diverse 3D urban scenes. MajutsuCity represents a city as a composition of controllable layouts, assets, and materials, and operates through a four-stage pipeline. To extend controllability beyond initial generation, we further integrate MajutsuAgent, an interactive language-grounded editing agent} that supports five object-level operations. To support photorealistic and customizable scene synthesis, we also construct MajutsuDataset, a high-quality multimodal dataset} containing 2D semantic layouts and height maps, diverse 3D building assets, and curated PBR materials and skyboxes, each accompanied by detailed annotations. Meanwhile, we develop a practical set of evaluation metrics, covering key dimensions such as structural consistency, scene complexity, material fidelity, and lighting atmosphere. Extensive experiments demonstrate MajutsuCity reduces layout FID by 83.7% compared with CityDreamer and by 20.1% over CityCraft. Our method ranks first across all AQS and RDR scores, outperforming existing methods by a clear margin. These results confirm MajutsuCity as a new state-of-the-art in geometric fidelity, stylistic adaptability, and semantic controllability for 3D city generation. We expect our framework can inspire new avenues of research in 3D city generation.

Recent efforts have leveraged pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, alongside long-tailed learning techniques to exploit rich visual-textual priors for improved performance. However, existing methods often derive semantic inter-class relationships directly from imbalanced datasets, resulting in unreliable correlations for tail classes due to data scarcity. Moreover, CLIP's zero-shot paradigm is optimized for single-label image-text matching, making it suboptimal for multi-label tasks. To address these issues, we propose the correlation adaptation prompt network (CAPNET), a novel end-to-end framework that explicitly models label correlations from CLIP's textual encoder. The framework incorporates a graph convolutional network for label-aware propagation and learnable soft prompts for refined embeddings. It utilizes a distribution-balanced Focal loss with class-aware re-weighting for optimized training under imbalance. Moreover, it improves generalization through test-time ensembling and realigns visual-textual modalities using parameter-efficient fine-tuning to avert overfitting on tail classes without compromising head class performance.

To answer this question, many data curation efforts center on the quality of a dataset. However, most of these existing methods are (i) offline, i.e. they produce a static dataset from a set of predetermined filtering criteria, and (ii) concept-agnostic, i.e. they use model-based filters which induce additional data biases. In this work, we go beyond such offline, concept-agnostic methods and advocate for more flexible, task-adaptive online concept-based curation. Our first contribution is DataConcept, a collection of 128M web-crawled image-text pairs annotated with fine-grained details about their concept composition. Building on DataConcept, we introduce Concept-Aware Batch Sampling (CABS), a simple yet effective batch sampling framework that flexibly constructs batches on-the-fly based on specific target distributions.

While diffusion models can generate diverse and expressive motions conditioned on text and scene context, they often produce physically implausible outputs, leading to execution drift during simulation. To address this, BRIC dynamically adapts the physics controller to noisy motion plans at test time, while preserving pre-trained skills via a loss function that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. In addition, BRIC introduces a lightweight test-time guidance mechanism that steers the diffusion model in the signal space without updating its parameters. By combining both adaptation strategies, BRIC ensures consistent and physically plausible long-term executions across diverse environments in an effective and efficient manner.

Finally, we present a unified generative framework that integrates the two individual model, capable of synthesizing complete HHOIs in a single advanced sampling process. Our method extends HHOI generation to multi-human settings, enabling interactions involving more than two individuals.

Each sentence is annotated for correctness, enabling direct assessment of VLMs as alignment evaluators. Benchmarking a wide range of decoder-based VLMs reveals three key findings: (i) CLIP-based models, even those tailored for compositional reasoning, remain nearly blind; (ii) detectors systematically over-score early sentences; and (iii) they show strong self-preference, favoring their own outputs and harming detection performance.

However, recent advanced methods such as BAGEL and LMFusion follow the Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) paradigm, adopting a symmetric design that mirrors one expert to another for convenient initialization and fusion, which remains suboptimal due to inherent modality discrepancies. In this work, we propose HBridge, an asymmetric H-shaped architecture that enables heterogeneous experts to optimally leverage pretrained priors from their respective modality domains. Unlike prior dense fusion strategies that straightforwardly connect all layers between experts via shared attention, HBridge selectively bridges intermediate layers, reducing over 40% attention sharing, which improves efficiency and enhances generation quality. Shallow and deep layers, which capture modality-specific representations, are decoupled, while mid-layer bridging promotes semantic alignment. To further strengthen cross-modal coherence, we introduce semantic reconstruction tokens that explicitly guide the generative expert to reconstruct visual semantic tokens of the target image. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of HBridge, establishing a new paradigm for unified multimodal generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "HBridge\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0H\u5f62\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6865\u63a5\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u51cf\u5c1140%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u79f0\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u955c\u50cf\u5316\u4e13\u5bb6\u4ee5\u65b9\u4fbf\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u800c\u6548\u679c\u6b20\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0H\u5f62\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6865\u63a5\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u6d45\u5c42\u548c\u6df1\u5c42\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u91cd\u5efa\u4ee4\u724c\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "HBridge\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6865\u63a5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

ReaDe follows a reason-then-describe paradigm: it first analyzes the user request to identify core requirements and resolve ambiguities, then produces detailed guidance that enables faithful, controllable generation. We train ReaDe via a two-stage optimization: (i) reasoning-augmented supervision imparts analytic parsing with stepwise traces and dense captions, and (ii) a multi-dimensional reward assigner enables stable, feedback-driven refinement for natural-style captions.

However, existing tokenizers are typically trained from scratch and struggle to balance semantic representation and reconstruction fidelity, particularly in high-dimensional latent spaces. In this work, we introduce DINO-Tok, a DINO-based visual tokenizer that unifies hierarchical representations into an information-complete latent space. By integrating shallow features that retain fine-grained details with deep features encoding global semantics, DINO-Tok effectively bridges pretrained representations and visual generation. We further analyze the challenges of vector quantization (VQ) in this high-dimensional space, where key information is often lost and codebook collapse occurs. We thus propose a global PCA reweighting mechanism to stabilize VQ and preserve essential information across dimensions. On ImageNet 256$\\times$256, DINO-Tok achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance, reaching 28.54 PSNR for autoencoding and 23.98 PSNR for VQ-based modeling, significantly outperforming prior tokenizers and comparable to billion-level data trained models (such as Hunyuan and Wan). These results demonstrate that adapting powerful pretrained vision models like DINO for tokenization enables semantically aligned and high-fidelity latent representations, enabling next-generation visual generative models.

Although recent video-3DGS methods ease open-world scene capturing, they are still unsuitable for benchmarking due to large visual and geometric sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Wanderland, a real-to-sim framework that features multi-sensor capture, reliable reconstruction, accurate geometry, and robust view synthesis. Using this pipeline, we curate a diverse dataset of indoor-outdoor urban scenes and systematically demonstrate how image-only pipelines scale poorly, how geometry quality impacts novel view synthesis, and how all of these adversely affect navigation policy learning and evaluation reliability. Beyond serving as a trusted testbed for embodied navigation, Wanderland's rich raw sensor data further allows benchmarking of 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis models. Our work establishes a new foundation for reproducible research in open-world embodied AI.

While these models excel at temporal coherence, their dynamics are often constrained by the continuous nature of their training data. We hypothesize that by injecting the rich and unconstrained content diversity from image data into this coherent temporal framework, we can generate image sets that feature both natural transitions and a far more expansive dynamic range. To this end, we introduce iMontage, a unified framework designed to repurpose a powerful video model into an all-in-one image generator. The framework consumes and produces variable-length image sets, unifying a wide array of image generation and editing tasks. To achieve this, we propose an elegant and minimally invasive adaptation strategy, complemented by a tailored data curation process and training paradigm. This approach allows the model to acquire broad image manipulation capabilities without corrupting its invaluable original motion priors. iMontage excels across several mainstream many-in-many-out tasks, not only maintaining strong cross-image contextual consistency but also generating scenes with extraordinary dynamics that surpass conventional scopes.

This gap mainly stems from two challenges: a semantic-geometric misalignment that prevents consistent 3D understanding, and the absence of persistent memory to retain 3D representation and understanding over time. To address these limitations, we present VLM$^2$, a Vision-Language Model with persistent Memory for spatial reasoning with a view-consistent, 3D-aware representation purely from 2D video. Specifically, to enhance long-horizon reasoning, we incorporate a dual-memory module, consisting of a working memory that operates as a sliding window to focus on immediate context, and an episodic memory that consolidates and stores critical long-term information.

However, it relies on a two-stage pipeline where the pretrained autoencoder introduces lossy reconstruction, leading to error accumulation while hindering joint optimization. To address these issues, we propose PixelDiT, a single-stage, end-to-end model that eliminates the need for the autoencoder and learns the diffusion process directly in the pixel space. PixelDiT adopts a fully transformer-based architecture shaped by a dual-level design: a patch-level DiT that captures global semantics and a pixel-level DiT that refines texture details, enabling efficient training of a pixel-space diffusion model while preserving fine details. Our analysis reveals that effective pixel-level token modeling is essential to the success of pixel diffusion. PixelDiT achieves 1.61 FID on ImageNet 256x256, surpassing existing pixel generative models by a large margin. We further extend PixelDiT to text-to-image generation and pretrain it at the 1024x1024 resolution in pixel space.

We argue that 3D-awareness is vital for modeling cross-task correlations essential for comprehensive scene understanding. We propose to address this problem by integrating correlations across views, i.e., cost volume, as geometric consistency in the MTL network. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight Cross-view Module (CvM), shared across tasks, to exchange information across views and capture cross-view correlations, integrated with a feature from MTL encoder for multi-task predictions.

We tackle this challenge by formulating it as a set-level policy optimization problem, with the goal of training a policy that can cover the diverse range of plausible outcomes for a given prompt. To address this, we introduce DPP-GRPO, a novel framework for diverse video generation that combines Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) theories to enforce explicit reward on diverse generations. Our objective turns diversity into an explicit signal by imposing diminishing returns on redundant samples (via DPP) while supplies groupwise feedback over candidate sets (via GRPO). Our framework is plug-and-play and model-agnostic, and encourages diverse generations across visual appearance, camera motions, and scene structure without sacrificing prompt fidelity or perceptual quality. We implement our method on WAN and CogVideoX, and show that our method consistently improves video diversity on state-of-the-art benchmarks such as VBench, VideoScore, and human preference studies.

The key is a short, explicit Chain-of-Sight (CoS) sequence that mirrors how human reason from images: find an object in 2D, then infer its distance, size, and pose. The decoder first emits 2D detections as a visual chain-of-thought, then predicts 3D boxes under an easy-to-hard curriculum: across objects, a near-to-far order reduces early ambiguity and matches ego-centric utility; within each object, a center-from-camera, dimensions, and rotation factorization ranks information by stability and learnability. This VLM-native interface preserves open-vocabulary and visual-prompting capability without specialized heads. On the challenging Omni3D benchmark, our model achieves state-of-the-art results, with 49.89 AP_3D, surpassing the previous best by +15.51 absolute improvement even when the baseline is given ground-truth 2D boxes. It also generalizes zero-shot to held-out categories with strong robustness. By turning 3D detection into a disciplined next-token problem, LocateAnything3D offers a practical foundation for models to perceive in 3D.", "AI": {"tldr": "LocateAnything3D\u5c063D\u68c0\u6d4b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2atoken\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Chain-of-Sight\u5e8f\u5217\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece2D\u68c0\u6d4b\u52303D\u6846\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728Omni3D\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u64c5\u957f2D\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u7269\u4f533D\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u611f\u77e53D\u4e16\u754c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Chain-of-Sight\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5148\u8fdb\u884c2D\u68c0\u6d4b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6309\u4ece\u8fd1\u5230\u8fdc\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u9884\u6d4b3D\u6846\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e2d\u5fc3-\u5c3a\u5bf8-\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728Omni3D\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523049.89 AP_3D\uff0c\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u534715.51\u4e2a\u7edd\u5bf9\u70b9\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u57fa\u7ebf\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9e2D\u6846\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c063D\u68c0\u6d4b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6709\u5e8f\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2atoken\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0cLocateAnything3D\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u76843D\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We introduce $\\infty$-RoPE, a unified inference-time framework that addresses all three limitations through three interconnected components: Block-Relativistic RoPE, KV Flush, and RoPE Cut. Block-Relativistic RoPE reformulates temporal encoding as a moving local reference frame, where each newly generated latent block is rotated relative to the base model's maximum frame horizon while earlier blocks are rotated backward to preserve relative temporal geometry. This relativistic formulation eliminates fixed temporal positions, enabling continuous video generation far beyond the base positional limits. To obtain fine-grained action control without re-encoding, KV Flush renews the KV cache by retaining only two latent frames, the global sink and the last generated latent frame, thereby ensuring immediate prompt responsiveness. Finally, RoPE Cut introduces controlled discontinuities in temporal RoPE coordinates, enabling multi-cut scene transitions within a single continuous rollout. Together, these components establish $\\infty$-RoPE as a training-free foundation for infinite-horizon, controllable, and cinematic video diffusion. Comprehensive experiments show that $\\infty$-RoPE consistently surpasses previous autoregressive models in overall VBench scores.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u221e-RoPE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u74f6\u9888\uff1a\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u3001\u7f13\u6162\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u573a\u666f\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e3D-RoPE\u7684\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u3001\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u63d0\u793a\u54cd\u5e94\u7f13\u6162\u4ee5\u53ca\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u7535\u5f71\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1aBlock-Relativistic RoPE\uff08\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u79fb\u52a8\u5c40\u90e8\u53c2\u8003\u7cfb\uff09\u3001KV Flush\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u7559\u5168\u5c40\u6c47\u70b9\u548c\u6700\u540e\u751f\u6210\u5e27\u6765\u66f4\u65b0KV\u7f13\u5b58\uff09\u548cRoPE Cut\uff08\u5728\u65f6\u95f4RoPE\u5750\u6807\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u53d7\u63a7\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u221e-RoPE\u5728VBench\u8bc4\u5206\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9650\u8303\u56f4\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u548c\u7535\u5f71\u5316\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u3002", "conclusion": "\u221e-RoPE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9650\u8303\u56f4\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u548c\u7535\u5f71\u5316\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u9650\u5236\u3002"}}

A key challenge, however, lies in designing effective and interpretable rewards. Existing methods often rely on either composite metrics (e.g., CLIP, OCR, and realism scores) with fixed weights or a single scalar reward distilled from human preference models, which can limit interpretability and flexibility. We propose RubricRL, a simple and general framework for rubric-based reward design that offers greater interpretability, composability, and user control. Instead of using a black-box scalar signal, RubricRL dynamically constructs a structured rubric for each prompt--a decomposable checklist of fine-grained visual criteria such as object correctness, attribute accuracy, OCR fidelity, and realism--tailored to the input text. Each criterion is independently evaluated by a multimodal judge (e.g., o4-mini), and a prompt-adaptive weighting mechanism emphasizes the most relevant dimensions. This design not only produces interpretable and modular supervision signals for policy optimization (e.g., GRPO or PPO), but also enables users to directly adjust which aspects to reward or penalize. Experiments with an autoregressive text-to-image model demonstrate that RubricRL improves prompt faithfulness, visual detail, and generalizability, while offering a flexible and extensible foundation for interpretable RL alignment across text-to-image architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "RubricRL\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u66ff\u4ee3\u9ed1\u76d2\u6807\u91cf\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u590d\u5408\u6307\u6807\u6216\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u6807\u91cf\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63d0\u793a\u52a8\u6001\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u7531\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u63d0\u793a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6743\u91cd\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aRubricRL\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63d0\u793a\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "RubricRL\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}
