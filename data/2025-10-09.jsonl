We first present a taxonomy of hallucination types and analyze\ntheir root causes across the entire LLM development lifecycle, from data\ncollection and architecture design to inference. We further examine how\nhallucinations emerge in key natural language generation tasks. Building on\nthis foundation, we introduce a structured taxonomy of detection approaches and\nanother taxonomy of mitigation strategies. We also analyze the strengths and\nlimitations of current detection and mitigation approaches and review existing\nevaluation benchmarks and metrics used to quantify LLMs hallucinations.\nFinally, we outline key open challenges and promising directions for future\nresearch, providing a foundation for the development of more truthful and\ntrustworthy LLMs."}

A\nsystematic exploration of the plate length ($L/D$), flexibility coefficient\n($S^{*}$), and mass ratio ($m^{*}$) reveals new laws and phenomena. The\nlarge-amplitude vibration of the structure is attributed to a resonance\nphenomenon induced by fluid-structure interaction. The modal decomposition\nindicates that resonance arises from the coupling between the first and second\nstructural modes, where the excitation of the second structural mode plays a\ncritical role. Due to the combined effects of added mass and periodic stiffness\nvariations, the two modes become synchronized, oscillating at the same\nfrequency while maintaining a fixed phase difference of $\\pi/2$. This further\nresults in the resonant frequency being locked at half of the second natural\nfrequency, which is approximately three times the first natural frequency. A\nreduction in plate length and an increase in mass ratio are both associated\nwith a narrower resonant locking range, while a higher mass ratio also shifts\nthis range toward lower frequencies. A symmetry-breaking bifurcation is\nobserved for cases with $L/D\\leq3.5$, whereas for $L/D=4.0$, the flow remains\nin a steady state with a stationary splitter plate prior to the onset of\nresonance.

However, instance-optimal\nbounds are known only for least-squares regression with dependent covariates;\nfor more general models or loss functions, the only broadly applicable\nguarantees result from a reduction to either i.i.d. learning, with effective\nsample size scaling only in the number of trajectories, or an existing\nsingle-trajectory result when each individual trajectory mixes, with effective\nsample size scaling as the full data budget deflated by the mixing-time.\n  In this work, we significantly broaden the scope of instance-optimal rates in\nmulti-trajectory settings via the Hellinger localization framework, a general\napproach for maximum likelihood estimation. Our method proceeds by first\ncontrolling the squared Hellinger distance at the path-measure level via a\nreduction to i.i.d. learning, followed by localization as a quadratic form in\nparameter space weighted by the trajectory Fisher information.

While many studies have demonstrated\nperformance benefits of combining multiple model predictions, existing\nstrategies using linear pooling methods (ranging from simple averaging to\ndynamic weight updates) face a key limitation.

In this work, we develop a model that\nuses machine learning to forecast the performance of predictions by models at\neach epoch in a time series. This enables `context-awareness' by assigning\nhigher weight to models that are likely to be more accurate at a given time. We\nshow that adding a performance forecasting worker in a decentralized learning\nnetwork, following a design similar to the Allora network, can improve the\naccuracy of network inferences. Specifically, we find forecasting models that\npredict regret (performance relative to the network inference) or regret\nz-score (performance relative to other workers) show greater improvement than\nmodels predicting losses, which often do not outperform the naive network\ninference (historically weighted average of all inferences).

To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose Tool-Augmented Policy Optimization (TAPO), a novel reinforcement\nlearning framework that systematically integrates multi-hop reasoning with\nadaptive tool-calling capabilities. Our approach employs a modified version of\nDynamic Sampling Policy Optimization (DAPO), a recently developed RL paradigm,\nwhich we adapt specifically for tool invocation scenarios, enabling models to\ndynamically interleave complex reasoning with on-demand tool usage (including\nsearch APIs and Python interpreters).\n  To support this research, we introduce two new datasets: TAPO-easy-60K and\nTAPO-hard-18K, specifically designed to train and evaluate both fact-based\nreasoning and mathematical calculation capabilities. Our experiments on\nQwen2.5-3B and Qwen2.5-7B models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,\nwith both models achieving state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring\nexternal knowledge and mathematical computation among methods with comparable\nparameters. Notably, TAPO achieves more efficient tool utilization than\nbaseline methods while preventing excessive calls caused by reward hacking.\nThese results highlight the significant potential of combining advanced\nreasoning with tool usage to enhance model performance in knowledge-intensive\nand computationally demanding tasks."}

Understanding the role of the\nconditions of life in this disparity can aid in developing more robust,\nadaptive, and caring artificial agents.

Our objective was to\nreplicate the results of the original paper, albeit using Llama 3 as the LLM\nfor evaluation instead of GPT-3.5-turbo. We built on the source code provided\nby Ma et al. (2024) to achieve our goal. Our work extends the original paper by\nmodifying the input embeddings or deleting the output embeddings of XRec's\nMixture of Experts module. Based on our results, XRec effectively generates\npersonalized explanations and its stability is improved by incorporating\ncollaborative information. However, XRec did not consistently outperform all\nbaseline models in every metric. Our extended analysis further highlights the\nimportance of the Mixture of Experts embeddings in shaping the explanation\nstructures, showcasing how collaborative signals interact with language\nmodeling. Through our work, we provide an open-source evaluation implementation\nthat enhances accessibility for researchers and practitioners alike.

In this work, we introduce AutoBalance, a novel \"post-combine\"\ntraining paradigm. AutoBalance assigns an independent adaptive optimizer to\neach loss component and aggregates the resulting preconditioned updates\nafterwards. Extensive experiments on challenging PDE benchmarks show that\nAutoBalance consistently outperforms existing frameworks, achieving significant\nreductions in solution error, as measured by both the MSE and $L^{\\infty}$\nnorms.

Extracting\nthese internal models through access to a DNN is conceptually similar to\nextracting a secret key via oracle access to a block cipher. Consequently,\ncryptanalytic techniques, particularly differential-like attacks, have been\nactively explored recently. ReLU-based DNNs are the most commonly and widely\ndeployed architectures. While early works (e.g., Crypto 2020, Eurocrypt 2024)\nassume access to exact output logits, which are usually invisible, more recent\nworks (e.g., Asiacrypt 2024, Eurocrypt 2025) focus on the hard-label setting,\nwhere only the final classification result (e.g., \"dog\" or \"car\") is available\nto the attacker.

Inspired by recent works in Deep Multiple Instance Learning\n(DMIL), we propose a method that trains pixel-level multi-class classifiers and\npredicts low-resolution labels (i.e., patch-level classification), where the\nactual high-resolution labels are learned implicitly without direct\nsupervision. This is achieved with flexible pooling layers that are able to\nlink the semantics of the pixels in the high-resolution imagery to the\nlow-resolution reference labels. Then, the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)\nproblem is re-framed in a multi-class and in a multi-label setting. In the\nformer, the low-resolution annotation represents the majority of the pixels in\nthe patch. In the latter, the annotation only provides us information on the\npresence of one of the land-cover classes in the patch and thus multiple labels\ncan be considered valid for a patch at a time, whereas the low-resolution\nlabels provide us only one label.

In this paper, we aim to adapt the medical knowledge learned by\nfoundation models from vast datasets to the probe guidance task, which is\ndesigned to provide real-time operational recommendations for junior\nsonographers to acquire high-quality ultrasound images. Moreover, inspired by\nthe practice where experts optimize action decisions based on past\nexplorations, we meticulously design a parameter-efficient Vision-Action\nAdapter (VA-Adapter) to enable foundation model's image encoder to encode\nvision-action sequences, thereby enhancing guidance performance. With built-in\nsequential reasoning capabilities in a compact design, the VA-Adapter enables a\npre-trained ultrasound foundation model to learn precise probe adjustment\nstrategies by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that the VA-Adapter can surpass strong probe guidance\nmodels. Our code will be released after acceptance."}

Recently, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has\nsimplified this paradigm by replacing the reward and value models with\nrule-based verifiers. A prominent example is Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO). However, GRPO inherently suffers from a length bias, since the same\nadvantage is uniformly assigned to all tokens of a response. As a result,\nlonger responses distribute the reward over more tokens and thus contribute\ndisproportionately to gradient updates. Several variants, such as DAPO and Dr.\nGRPO, modify the token-level aggregation of the loss, yet these methods remain\nheuristic and offer limited interpretability regarding their implicit token\npreferences. In this work, we explore the possibility of allowing the model to\nlearn its own token preference during optimization. We unify existing\nframeworks under a single formulation and introduce a learnable parameter\n$\\lambda$ that adaptively controls token-level weighting. We use $\\lambda$-GRPO\nto denote our method, and we find that $\\lambda$-GRPO achieves consistent\nimprovements over vanilla GRPO and DAPO on multiple mathematical reasoning\nbenchmarks. On Qwen2.5 models with 1.5B, 3B, and 7B parameters, $\\lambda$-GRPO\nimproves average accuracy by $+1.9\\%$, $+1.0\\%$, and $+1.7\\%$ compared to GRPO,\nrespectively.

A bank failure can destroy the stability of the financial\nsystem, as banks are subject to systemic risk, affecting not only individual\nbanks but also segments or the entire financial system. Calculating the\nprobability of a bank going bankrupt is one way to ensure the banking system is\nsafe and sound. Existing literature and limitations: Statistical models, such\nas Altman's Z-Score, are one of the common techniques for developing a\nbankruptcy prediction model. However, statistical methods rely on rigid and\nsometimes irrelevant assumptions, which can result in low forecast accuracy.\nNew approaches are necessary. Objective of the research: Bankruptcy models are\ndeveloped using machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression (LR),\nrandom forest (RF), and support vector machines (SVM). According to several\nstudies, machine learning is also more accurate and effective than statistical\nmethods for categorising and forecasting banking risk management. Present\nResearch: The commercial bank data are derived from the annual financial\nstatements of 44 active banks and 21 bankrupt banks in Turkey from 1994 to\n2004, and the rural bank data are derived from the quarterly financial reports\nof 43 active and 43 bankrupt rural banks in Indonesia between 2013 and 2019.\nFive rural banks in Indonesia have also been selected to demonstrate the\nfeasibility of analysing bank bankruptcy trends. Findings and implications: The\nresults of the research experiments show that RF can forecast data from\ncommercial banks with a 90% accuracy rate. Furthermore, the three machine\nlearning methods proposed accurately predict the likelihood of rural bank\nbankruptcy.

One key challenge in\nlong video captioning is accurately recognizing the same individuals who appear\nin different frames, which we refer to as the ID-Matching problem. Few prior\nworks have focused on this important issue. Those that have, usually suffer\nfrom limited generalization and depend on point-wise matching, which limits\ntheir overall effectiveness. In this paper, unlike previous approaches, we\nbuild upon LVLMs to leverage their powerful priors. We aim to unlock the\ninherent ID-Matching capabilities within LVLMs themselves to enhance the\nID-Matching performance of captions. Specifically, we first introduce a new\nbenchmark for assessing the ID-Matching capabilities of video captions. Using\nthis benchmark, we investigate LVLMs containing GPT-4o, revealing key insights\nthat the performance of ID-Matching can be improved through two methods: 1)\nenhancing the usage of image information and 2) increasing the quantity of\ninformation of individual descriptions. Based on these insights, we propose a\nnovel video captioning method called Recognizing Identities for Captioning\nEffectively (RICE). Extensive experiments including assessments of caption\nquality and ID-Matching performance, demonstrate the superiority of our\napproach.

On the other hand, for models that\nare biased towards the function to be learned a lower effective dimension is\nlikely beneficial during training. To obtain these results, we derive an\nanalytical expression of the FIM for Fourier models and identify the features\ncontrolling a model's effective dimension. This allows us to construct models\nwith tunable effective dimension and bias, and to compare their training. We\nfurthermore introduce a tensor network representation of the considered Fourier\nmodels, which could be a tool of independent interest for the analysis of QNN\nmodels. Overall, these findings provide an explicit example of the interplay\nbetween geometrical properties, model-task alignment and training, which are\nrelevant for the broader machine learning community."}

We argue that\nposterior covariance provides a consistent signal of distribution shift,\nleading to larger trace and leading eigenvalues on OOD inputs, yielding a clear\nspectral signature. We further provide analysis explicitly linking posterior\ncovariance to distribution mismatch, establishing it as a reliable signal for\nOOD detection. To ensure tractability, we adopt a Jacobian-free subspace\niteration method to estimate the leading eigenvalues using only forward\nevaluations of the denoiser. Empirically, EigenScore achieves SOTA performance,\nwith up to 5% AUROC improvement over the best baseline.

To distill this, a key conceptual tool is introduced, which we refer\nto as \"faithful\" stationarization of the regret formulation. Essentially, the\nfinite horizon dynamic optimization problem is converted into a stationary\ncounterpart which \"closely resembles\" the original objective (in contrast, the\nclassical infinite horizon discounted formulation, that leads to the Gittins\nindex, alters the problem and objective in too significant a manner). The newly\ncrafted time invariant objective can be studied using Bellman's principle which\nleads to a time invariant optimal policy. When viewed through this lens,\nThompson Sampling admits a simple online optimization form that mimics the\nstructure of the Bellman-optimal policy, and where greediness is regularized by\na measure of residual uncertainty based on point-biserial correlation. This\nanswers the question of how Thompson Sampling balances\nexploration-exploitation, and moreover, provides a principled framework to\nstudy and further improve Thompson's original idea."}

The resulting feature maps are then fed into the TFT, which\napplies multi-head attention to capture both short- and long-term dependencies\nand to weigh relevant covariates adaptively. We evaluate the CNN-TFT on a\nhydroelectric natural flow time series dataset. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that CNN-TFT outperforms well-established deep learning models,\nwith a mean absolute percentage error of up to 2.2%. The explainability of the\nmodel is obtained by a proposed Shapley additive explanations with multi-head\nattention weights (SHAP-MHAW). Our novel architecture, named CNN-TFT-SHAP-MHAW,\nis promising for applications requiring high-fidelity, multivariate time series\nforecasts, being available for future analysis at\nhttps://github.com/SFStefenon/CNN-TFT-SHAP-MHAW ."}

A bank failure can destroy the stability of the financial\nsystem, as banks are subject to systemic risk, affecting not only individual\nbanks but also segments or the entire financial system. Calculating the\nprobability of a bank going bankrupt is one way to ensure the banking system is\nsafe and sound. Existing literature and limitations: Statistical models, such\nas Altman's Z-Score, are one of the common techniques for developing a\nbankruptcy prediction model. However, statistical methods rely on rigid and\nsometimes irrelevant assumptions, which can result in low forecast accuracy.\nNew approaches are necessary. Objective of the research: Bankruptcy models are\ndeveloped using machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression (LR),\nrandom forest (RF), and support vector machines (SVM). According to several\nstudies, machine learning is also more accurate and effective than statistical\nmethods for categorising and forecasting banking risk management. Present\nResearch: The commercial bank data are derived from the annual financial\nstatements of 44 active banks and 21 bankrupt banks in Turkey from 1994 to\n2004, and the rural bank data are derived from the quarterly financial reports\nof 43 active and 43 bankrupt rural banks in Indonesia between 2013 and 2019.\nFive rural banks in Indonesia have also been selected to demonstrate the\nfeasibility of analysing bank bankruptcy trends. Findings and implications: The\nresults of the research experiments show that RF can forecast data from\ncommercial banks with a 90% accuracy rate. Furthermore, the three machine\nlearning methods proposed accurately predict the likelihood of rural bank\nbankruptcy.

We propose Markovian Thinking, a paradigm in which the policy advances\nreasoning while conditioning on a constant-size state, decoupling thinking\nlength from context size. As an immediate consequence this yields linear\ncompute with constant memory. We instantiate this idea with Delethink, an RL\nenvironment that structures reasoning into fixed-size chunks.

To this end, we use a joint human\nexpert-LLM judge approach to evaluate over 11,000 MWPs generated by open and\nclosed LLMs and develop the first teacher-annotated dataset for\nstandards-aligned educational MWP generation. We show the value of our data by\nusing it to train a 12B open model that matches the performance of larger and\nmore capable open models. We also use our teacher-annotated data to train a\ntext classifier that enables a 30B open LLM to outperform existing closed\nbaselines without any training. Next, we show our models' MWPs are more similar\nto human-written MWPs than those from existing models. We conclude by\nconducting the first study of customized LLM-generated MWPs with grade school\nstudents, finding they perform similarly on our models' MWPs relative to\nhuman-written MWPs but consistently prefer our customized MWPs."}

We apply MLE-Smith to 224 of\nreal-world datasets and generate 606 tasks spanning multiple categories,\nobjectives, and modalities, demonstrating that MLE-Smith can work effectively\nacross a wide range of real-world datasets. Evaluation on the generated tasks\nshows that the performance of eight mainstream and cutting-edge LLMs on\nMLE-Smith tasks is strongly correlated with their performance on carefully\nhuman-designed tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of the MLE-Smith to\nscaling up MLE tasks, while maintaining task quality."}

Prior work shows that reinforcement learning with rubric-based\nrewards leads to consistent gains in LLM post-training. Most existing\napproaches rely on rubrics that remain static over the course of training. Such\nstatic rubrics, however, are vulnerable to reward-hacking type behaviors and\nfail to capture emergent desiderata that arise during training. We introduce\nOnline Rubrics Elicitation (OnlineRubrics), a method that dynamically curates\nevaluation criteria in an online manner through pairwise comparisons of\nresponses from current and reference policies. This online process enables\ncontinuous identification and mitigation of errors as training proceeds.\nEmpirically, this approach yields consistent improvements of up to 8% over\ntraining exclusively with static rubrics across AlpacaEval, GPQA, ArenaHard as\nwell as the validation sets of expert questions and rubrics. We qualitatively\nanalyze the elicited criteria and identify prominent themes such as\ntransparency, practicality, organization, and reasoning."}

Existing approaches to combat this\nrely on inference-time scaffolding or costly step-level supervision, neither of\nwhich scales easily. In this work, we introduce a scalable method to bootstrap\nlong-horizon reasoning capabilities using only existing, abundant short-horizon\ndata. Our approach synthetically composes simple problems into complex,\nmulti-step dependency chains of arbitrary length. We train models on this data\nusing outcome-only rewards under a curriculum that automatically increases in\ncomplexity, allowing RL training to be scaled much further without saturating.\nEmpirically, our method generalizes remarkably well: curriculum training on\ncomposed 6th-grade level math problems (GSM8K) boosts accuracy on longer,\ncompetition-level benchmarks (GSM-Symbolic, MATH-500, AIME) by up to 2.06x.\nImportantly, our long-horizon improvements are significantly higher than\nbaselines even at high pass@k, showing that models can learn new reasoning\npaths under RL. Theoretically, we show that curriculum RL with outcome rewards\nachieves an exponential improvement in sample complexity over full-horizon\ntraining, providing training signal comparable to dense supervision. h1\ntherefore introduces an efficient path towards scaling RL for long-horizon\nproblems using only existing data."}

When instructions\nprovide only a general and abstract goal without specific details about\npotential issues in the response, LLMs must rely on their internal knowledge to\nimprove response quality, a process referred to as intrinsic self-correction.\nThe empirical success of intrinsic self-correction is evident in various\napplications, but how and why it is effective remains unknown. Focusing on\nmoral self-correction in LLMs, we reveal a key characteristic of intrinsic\nself-correction: performance convergence through multi-round interactions; and\nprovide a mechanistic analysis of this convergence behavior. Based on our\nexperimental results and analysis, we uncover the underlying mechanism of\nconvergence: consistently injected self-correction instructions activate moral\nconcepts that reduce model uncertainty, leading to converged performance as the\nactivated moral concepts stabilize over successive rounds. This paper\ndemonstrates the strong potential of moral self-correction by showing that it\nexhibits a desirable property of converged performance."}
