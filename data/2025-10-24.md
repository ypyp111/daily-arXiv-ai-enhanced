### [1] [Fourier-Based GAN Fingerprint Detection using ResNet50](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19840)
*Sai Teja Erukude,Viswa Chaitanya Marella,Suhasnadh Reddy Veluru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用频域分析和深度学习检测StyleGAN生成的图像，通过2D傅里叶变换和ResNet50网络在频域中识别GAN图像的周期性伪影，准确率达92.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成对抗网络(GANs)产生的逼真图像对图像取证和需要可靠内容真实性的工业系统构成严重挑战，需要有效区分真实图像和GAN生成图像的方法。

Method: 应用二维离散傅里叶变换(2D DFT)将图像转换到频域，在频域中检测细微的周期性伪影，然后使用ResNet50神经网络在变换后的图像上进行训练，区分真实和合成图像。

Result: 频域模型达到92.8%的准确率和0.95的AUC值，显著优于在原始空间域图像上训练的等效模型。

Conclusion: GAN生成的图像具有独特的频域特征或"指纹"，结合信号处理技术和深度学习的方法在增强数字取证和加强工业AI系统可信度方面具有工业潜力。

Abstract: The rapid rise of photorealistic images produced from Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) poses a serious challenge for image forensics and industrial
systems requiring reliable content authenticity. This paper uses
frequency-domain analysis combined with deep learning to solve the problem of
distinguishing StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Specifically, a
two-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform (2D DFT) was applied to transform
images into the Fourier domain, where subtle periodic artifacts become
detectable. A ResNet50 neural network is trained on these transformed images to
differentiate between real and synthetic ones. The experiments demonstrate that
the frequency-domain model achieves a 92.8 percent and an AUC of 0.95,
significantly outperforming the equivalent model trained on raw spatial-domain
images. These results indicate that the GAN-generated images have unique
frequency-domain signatures or "fingerprints". The method proposed highlights
the industrial potential of combining signal processing techniques and deep
learning to enhance digital forensics and strengthen the trustworthiness of
industrial AI systems.

### [2] [Transformed Multi-view 3D Shape Features with Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19955)
*Márcus Vinícius Lobo Costa,Sherlon Almeida da Silva,Bárbara Caroline Benato,Leo Sampaio Ferraz Ribeiro,Moacir Antonelli Ponti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究将Vision Transformers与对比学习目标结合用于3D形状特征表示学习，在ModelNet10上达到90.6%准确率，克服了CNN在捕捉形状关系上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决计算机视觉方法在从2D图像识别3D物体时的挑战，传统CNN方法需要大量标注数据且可能忽略重要的形状关系。

Method: 采用Vision Transformers架构与现代对比学习目标相结合，包括有监督和无监督对比学习，用于多视角3D分析。

Result: 在ModelNet10数据集上，有监督对比学习达到约90.6%的准确率，验证了ViT与对比学习结合的有效性。

Conclusion: ViT能够捕捉全局形状语义，对比学习优化局部判别特征，这种组合方法无需大量标注数据，在3D表示学习中表现出色。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges in representation learning of 3D shape
features by investigating state-of-the-art backbones paired with both
contrastive supervised and self-supervised learning objectives. Computer vision
methods struggle with recognizing 3D objects from 2D images, often requiring
extensive labeled data and relying on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that
may overlook crucial shape relationships. Our work demonstrates that Vision
Transformers (ViTs) based architectures, when paired with modern contrastive
objectives, achieve promising results in multi-view 3D analysis on our
downstream tasks, unifying contrastive and 3D shape understanding pipelines.
For example, supervised contrastive losses reached about 90.6% accuracy on
ModelNet10. The use of ViTs and contrastive learning, leveraging ViTs' ability
to understand overall shapes and contrastive learning's effectiveness,
overcomes the need for extensive labeled data and the limitations of CNNs in
capturing crucial shape relationships. The success stems from capturing global
shape semantics via ViTs and refining local discriminative features through
contrastive optimization. Importantly, our approach is empirical, as it is
grounded on extensive experimental evaluation to validate the effectiveness of
combining ViTs with contrastive objectives for 3D representation learning.

### [3] [FutrTrack: A Camera-LiDAR Fusion Transformer for 3D Multiple Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19981)
*Martha Teiko Teye,Ori Maoz,Matthias Rottmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FutrTrack是一个模块化的相机-LiDAR多目标跟踪框架，通过引入基于transformer的平滑器和融合驱动跟踪器，在现有3D检测器基础上构建，在nuScenes和KITTI数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单传感器跟踪方法性能有限，需要开发能够充分利用多模态传感器特征的跟踪框架，以在遮挡和视角变化下实现鲁棒的重新识别。

Method: 采用基于查询的跟踪框架，包含多模态两阶段transformer精炼和跟踪流水线。融合跟踪器集成边界框与多模态BEV融合特征，无需显式运动模型。跟踪前使用时序平滑器在移动窗口上精炼边界框序列。

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上达到74.7的aMOTA，在3D MOT基准测试中表现出色，减少了身份切换同时保持竞争力精度。

Conclusion: 基于查询的transformer跟踪方法从多模态传感器特征中获益显著，为改进基于transformer的跟踪器提供了高效框架，即使数据有限且无需预训练也能与其他神经网络方法竞争。

Abstract: We propose FutrTrack, a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework
that builds on existing 3D detectors by introducing a transformer-based
smoother and a fusion-driven tracker. Inspired by query-based tracking
frameworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and
tracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal
bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without
the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates
identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for
robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to
tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a
moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial
consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that
query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal
sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA
of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D
MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive
accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving
transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods
even with limited data and without pretraining.

### [4] [Improving Predictive Confidence in Medical Imaging via Online Label Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20011)
*Kushan Choudhury,Shubhrodeep Roy,Ankur Chanda,Shubhajit Biswas,Somenath Kuiry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在线标签平滑(OLS)通过动态调整软标签来改善医学图像分类中的过度自信预测，在RadImageNet数据集上相比传统方法提升了分类准确率和特征表示质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在医学图像分类中常产生过度自信预测，影响可靠性。传统标签平滑方法不考虑类别间关系，需要更智能的解决方案。

Method: 使用在线标签平滑(OLS)，在训练过程中基于模型自身预测模式动态调整软标签。在RadImageNet数据集上评估了ResNet-50、MobileNetV2和VGG-19三种架构。

Result: OLS在所有架构上均提升了Top-1和Top-5分类准确率，优于硬标签、传统标签平滑和无教师知识蒸馏。同时产生了更紧凑和分离的特征嵌入。

Conclusion: OLS不仅增强了预测性能，还改善了校准效果，是医学影像领域开发可信AI系统的实用有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks, have achieved
impressive results in medical image classification. However, these models often
produce overconfident predictions, which can undermine their reliability in
critical healthcare settings. While traditional label smoothing offers a simple
way to reduce such overconfidence, it fails to consider relationships between
classes by treating all non-target classes equally. In this study, we explore
the use of Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic approach that adjusts soft
labels throughout training based on the model's own prediction patterns. We
evaluate OLS on the large-scale RadImageNet dataset using three widely used
architectures: ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19. Our results show that OLS
consistently improves both Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to
standard training methods, including hard labels, conventional label smoothing,
and teacher-free knowledge distillation. In addition to accuracy gains, OLS
leads to more compact and well-separated feature embeddings, indicating
improved representation learning. These findings suggest that OLS not only
strengthens predictive performance but also enhances calibration, making it a
practical and effective solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in the
medical imaging domain.

### [5] [A Unified Detection Pipeline for Robust Object Detection in Fisheye-Based Traffic Surveillance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20016)
*Neema Jakisa Owor,Joshua Kofi Asamoah,Tanner Wambui Muturi,Anneliese Jakisa Owor,Blessing Agyei Kyem,Andrews Danyo,Yaw Adu-Gyamfi,Armstrong Aboah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于鱼眼图像的目标检测框架，通过预处理和后处理管道以及模型集成策略，在鱼眼交通图像上实现鲁棒检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鱼眼相机在广域交通监控中具有优势，但其固有的径向畸变和非均匀分辨率给标准目标检测器带来挑战，特别是在图像边界区域物体外观严重退化。

Method: 采用简单有效的预处理和后处理管道，在鱼眼交通图像上训练多个先进检测模型，并通过集成策略结合它们的输出。

Result: 在2025 AI City Challenge Track 4上获得F1分数0.6366，在62支队伍中排名第8。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了鱼眼图像固有的检测问题，在严重畸变条件下实现了鲁棒的目标检测。

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer an efficient solution for wide-area traffic
surveillance by capturing large fields of view from a single vantage point.
However, the strong radial distortion and nonuniform resolution inherent in
fisheye imagery introduce substantial challenges for standard object detectors,
particularly near image boundaries where object appearance is severely
degraded. In this work, we present a detection framework designed to operate
robustly under these conditions. Our approach employs a simple yet effective
pre and post processing pipeline that enhances detection consistency across the
image, especially in regions affected by severe distortion. We train several
state-of-the-art detection models on the fisheye traffic imagery and combine
their outputs through an ensemble strategy to improve overall detection
accuracy. Our method achieves an F1 score of0.6366 on the 2025 AI City
Challenge Track 4, placing 8thoverall out of 62 teams. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in addressing issues inherent to
fisheye imagery.

### [6] [Extreme Views: 3DGS Filter for Novel View Synthesis from Out-of-Distribution Camera Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20027)
*Damian Bowness,Charalambos Poullis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种实时渲染感知过滤方法，通过中间梯度导出的敏感度分数来减少3D高斯泼溅模型在训练分布外视角下的视觉噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅模型在训练数据分布之外的视角下会产生大量视觉噪声，这是由于缺乏这些外推区域的训练数据导致模型预测的不确定性。

Method: 利用中间梯度导出的敏感度分数，专门针对各向异性方向引起的不稳定性进行过滤，直接解决生成不确定性的核心问题。

Result: 实验评估表明，该方法相比现有的基于神经辐射场的方法（如BayesRays）显著提高了视觉质量、真实感和一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实时无缝集成到现有的3DGS渲染管道中，无需大量的后训练或微调，使3D重建系统在用户自由导航到原始训练视角之外时仍能保持高视觉保真度。

Abstract: When viewing a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from camera positions
significantly outside the training data distribution, substantial visual noise
commonly occurs. These artifacts result from the lack of training data in these
extrapolated regions, leading to uncertain density, color, and geometry
predictions from the model.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time render-aware filtering
method. Our approach leverages sensitivity scores derived from intermediate
gradients, explicitly targeting instabilities caused by anisotropic
orientations rather than isotropic variance. This filtering method directly
addresses the core issue of generative uncertainty, allowing 3D reconstruction
systems to maintain high visual fidelity even when users freely navigate
outside the original training viewpoints.
  Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method substantially improves
visual quality, realism, and consistency compared to existing Neural Radiance
Field (NeRF)-based approaches such as BayesRays. Critically, our filter
seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS rendering pipelines in real-time,
unlike methods that require extensive post-hoc retraining or fine-tuning.

### [7] [BrainPuzzle: Hybrid Physics and Data-Driven Reconstruction for Transcranial Ultrasound Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20029)
*Shengyu Chen,Shihang Feng,Yi Luo,Xiaowei Jia,Youzuo Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainPuzzle是一个混合两阶段框架，结合物理建模和机器学习，用于通过稀疏孔径超声实现定量经颅脑成像，准确重建脑部声速分布图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理全波形反演受限于颅骨引起的信号衰减和稀疏孔径覆盖，而纯数据驱动方法在低信噪比条件下会产生定量偏差的声速图。需要结合物理建模和机器学习来克服这些限制。

Method: 第一阶段使用逆时偏移（时间反演声学）处理多角度采集数据生成迁移片段；第二阶段使用基于Transformer的超分辨率编码器-解码器，结合图注意力单元融合片段生成准确的声速图像。采用可移动低计数换能器的部分阵列采集策略。

Result: 在两个合成数据集上的实验表明，BrainPuzzle实现了优越的声速重建精度和图像完整性。

Conclusion: BrainPuzzle展示了推进定量超声脑成像的潜力，通过混合算法补偿缺失孔径，在低信噪比和稀疏孔径条件下产生定量准确的声速图像。

Abstract: Ultrasound brain imaging remains challenging due to the large difference in
sound speed between the skull and brain tissues and the difficulty of coupling
large probes to the skull. This work aims to achieve quantitative transcranial
ultrasound by reconstructing an accurate speed-of-sound (SoS) map of the brain.
Traditional physics-based full-waveform inversion (FWI) is limited by weak
signals caused by skull-induced attenuation, mode conversion, and phase
aberration, as well as incomplete spatial coverage since full-aperture arrays
are clinically impractical. In contrast, purely data-driven methods that learn
directly from raw ultrasound data often fail to model the complex nonlinear and
nonlocal wave propagation through bone, leading to anatomically plausible but
quantitatively biased SoS maps under low signal-to-noise and sparse-aperture
conditions. To address these issues, we propose BrainPuzzle, a hybrid two-stage
framework that combines physical modeling with machine learning. In the first
stage, reverse time migration (time-reversal acoustics) is applied to
multi-angle acquisitions to produce migration fragments that preserve
structural details even under low SNR. In the second stage, a transformer-based
super-resolution encoder-decoder with a graph-based attention unit (GAU) fuses
these fragments into a coherent and quantitatively accurate SoS image. A
partial-array acquisition strategy using a movable low-count transducer set
improves feasibility and coupling, while the hybrid algorithm compensates for
the missing aperture. Experiments on two synthetic datasets show that
BrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image
completeness, demonstrating its potential for advancing quantitative ultrasound
brain imaging.

### [8] [Exposing Blindspots: Cultural Bias Evaluation in Generative Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20042)
*Huichan Seo,Sieun Choi,Minki Hong,Yi Zhou,Junseo Kim,Lukman Ismaila,Naome Etori,Mehul Agarwal,Zhixuan Liu,Jihie Kim,Jean Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个统一评估框架，用于检测生成式图像模型中的文化偏见，涵盖文本到图像生成和图像到图像编辑，发现在国家无关提示下模型偏向全球北方现代描绘，迭代编辑会侵蚀文化保真度，当前系统无法可靠进行文化敏感编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注文本到图像系统的文化偏见，而图像到图像编辑器的文化偏见研究不足，需要建立标准化评估协议来诊断和追踪生成式图像模型中的文化偏见。

Method: 使用统一评估框架，涵盖六个国家、8个类别/36个子类别的模式，结合时代感知提示，采用标准自动指标、文化感知检索增强VQA和本地评审员的专家人工判断。

Result: 研究发现：1）国家无关提示下模型默认全球北方现代描绘；2）迭代编辑侵蚀文化保真度；3）图像到图像模型仅应用表面线索而非时代一致的情境感知变化。

Conclusion: 当前系统在文化敏感编辑方面不可靠，通过发布标准化数据、提示和人工评估协议，为诊断和追踪生成式图像模型中的文化偏见提供了可复现的文化中心基准。

Abstract: Generative image models produce striking visuals yet often misrepresent
culture. Prior work has examined cultural bias mainly in text-to-image (T2I)
systems, leaving image-to-image (I2I) editors underexplored. We bridge this gap
with a unified evaluation across six countries, an 8-category/36-subcategory
schema, and era-aware prompts, auditing both T2I generation and I2I editing
under a standardized protocol that yields comparable diagnostics. Using open
models with fixed settings, we derive cross-country, cross-era, and
cross-category evaluations. Our framework combines standard automatic metrics,
a culture-aware retrieval-augmented VQA, and expert human judgments collected
from native reviewers. To enable reproducibility, we release the complete image
corpus, prompts, and configurations. Our study reveals three findings: (1)
under country-agnostic prompts, models default to Global-North, modern-leaning
depictions that flatten cross-country distinctions; (2) iterative I2I editing
erodes cultural fidelity even when conventional metrics remain flat or improve;
and (3) I2I models apply superficial cues (palette shifts, generic props)
rather than era-consistent, context-aware changes, often retaining source
identity for Global-South targets. These results highlight that
culture-sensitive edits remain unreliable in current systems. By releasing
standardized data, prompts, and human evaluation protocols, we provide a
reproducible, culture-centered benchmark for diagnosing and tracking cultural
bias in generative image models.

### [9] [Filter-Based Reconstruction of Images from Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20071)
*Bernd Pfrommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FIBAR方法，一种基于滤波器的异步重建方法，用于从移动事件相机的事件中重建强度图像，该方法在CPU上运行，无需神经网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常使用神经网络在GPU上处理事件相机的图像重建，这需要大量计算资源。本文旨在开发一种更简单、异步的方法，能够在CPU上高效运行。

Method: 使用时间数字IIR滤波器整合事件信号强度变化，通过新颖算法检测陈旧像素并调节最近更新像素窗口，对陈旧像素应用高斯滤波以减少重建噪声。

Result: FIBAR在笔记本电脑CPU上处理速度约4200万事件/秒（启用空间滤波）或1.4亿事件/秒（未启用空间滤波），重建图像比神经网络方法更嘈杂且存在鬼影，但足以完成某些任务如检测基准标记。

Conclusion: FIBAR提供了一种简单有效的异步图像重建方法，虽然质量不如神经网络方法，但在计算资源有限的情况下具有实用价值，特别适用于某些特定应用场景。

Abstract: Reconstructing an intensity image from the events of a moving event camera is
a challenging task that is typically approached with neural networks deployed
on graphics processing units. This paper presents a much simpler, FIlter Based
Asynchronous Reconstruction method (FIBAR). First, intensity changes signaled
by events are integrated with a temporal digital IIR filter. To reduce
reconstruction noise, stale pixels are detected by a novel algorithm that
regulates a window of recently updated pixels. Arguing that for a moving
camera, the absence of events at a pixel location likely implies a low image
gradient, stale pixels are then blurred with a Gaussian filter. In contrast to
most existing methods, FIBAR is asynchronous and permits image read-out at an
arbitrary time. It runs on a modern laptop CPU at about 42(140) million
events/s with (without) spatial filtering enabled. A few simple qualitative
experiments are presented that show the difference in image reconstruction
between FIBAR and a neural network-based approach (FireNet). FIBAR's
reconstruction is noisier than neural network-based methods and suffers from
ghost images. However, it is sufficient for certain tasks such as the detection
of fiducial markers. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的变换双边张量低秩表示模型TBTLRR，通过自适应学习酉变换来捕获全局相关性，同时利用双边结构挖掘局部相关性，并整合ℓ1/2范数和Frobenius范数正则化来处理复杂噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有张量低秩表示方法依赖固定变换，对噪声鲁棒性差。需要开发能够自适应学习变换、同时捕获全局和局部相关性、并能有效处理复杂噪声的方法。

Method: TBTLRR模型引入数据自适应的张量核范数，学习任意酉变换；利用潜在张量数据的双边结构挖掘局部相关性；整合ℓ1/2范数和Frobenius范数正则化；基于ADMM开发高效优化算法。

Result: 大量实验验证了该方法在聚类任务上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: TBTLRR通过自适应变换、双边结构和复合正则化，在图像聚类中表现出优越性能，为处理复杂噪声提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Tensor low-rank representation (TLRR) has demonstrated significant success in
image clustering. However, most existing methods rely on fixed transformations
and suffer from poor robustness to noise. In this paper, we propose a novel
transformed bilateral tensor low-rank representation model called TBTLRR, which
introduces a data-adaptive tensor nuclear norm by learning arbitrary unitary
transforms, allowing for more effective capture of global correlations. In
addition, by leveraging the bilateral structure of latent tensor data, TBTLRR
is able to exploit local correlations between image samples and features.
Furthermore, TBTLRR integrates the $\ell_{1/2}$-norm and Frobenius norm
regularization terms for better dealing with complex noise in real-world
scenarios. To solve the proposed nonconvex model, we develop an efficient
optimization algorithm inspired by the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) and provide theoretical convergence. Extensive experiments
validate its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in clustering. The
code will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/TBTLRR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Endoshare是一个开源跨平台应用，用于标准化和匿名化内窥镜手术视频，解决视频格式异构性和隐私问题，支持手术数据科学应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频评估和手术数据科学在手术培训、研究和质量改进中有重要作用，但目前受限于异构的视频记录格式和视频共享相关的隐私担忧。

Method: 采用软件开发生命周期和迭代式用户中心反馈开发。分析阶段通过内部调查确定关键需求，采用隐私设计架构；测试阶段通过外部临床医生调查评估可用性和采用度，并在不同硬件配置上进行基准测试。

Result: 原型测试显示高可用性评分（临床医生4.68/5，计算机科学家4.03/5），改进后外科医生报告高感知有用性（5.07/7）、易用性（5.15/7）、启发式可用性（4.38/5）和强烈推荐（9.20/10）。处理时间受处理模式、视频时长和机器计算能力影响。

Conclusion: Endoshare提供了一个透明、用户友好的标准化隐私保护手术视频管理流程。需要合规认证和更广泛的互操作性验证来确立其作为专有系统的可部署替代方案。

Abstract: Video-based assessment and surgical data science can advance surgical
training, research, and quality improvement. However, widespread use remains
limited by heterogeneous recording formats and privacy concerns associated with
video sharing. We present Endoshare, a source-available, cross-platform
application for merging, standardizing, and de-identifying endoscopic videos in
minimally invasive surgery. Development followed the software development life
cycle with iterative, user-centered feedback. During the analysis phase, an
internal survey of clinicians and computer scientists based on ten usability
heuristics identified key requirements that guided a privacy-by-design
architecture. In the testing phase, an external clinician survey combined the
same heuristics with Technology Acceptance Model constructs to assess usability
and adoption, complemented by benchmarking across different hardware
configurations. Four clinicians and four computer scientists initially tested
the prototype, reporting high usability (4.68 +/- 0.40/5 and 4.03 +/- 0.51/5),
with the lowest score (4.00 +/- 0.93/5) relating to label clarity. After
refinement, the testing phase surveyed ten surgeons who reported high perceived
usefulness (5.07 +/- 1.75/7), ease of use (5.15 +/- 1.71/7), heuristic
usability (4.38 +/- 0.48/5), and strong recommendation (9.20 +/- 0.79/10).
Processing time varied with processing mode, video duration (both p <= 0.001),
and machine computational power (p = 0.041). Endoshare provides a transparent,
user-friendly pipeline for standardized, privacy-preserving surgical video
management. Compliance certification and broader interoperability validation
are needed to establish it as a deployable alternative to proprietary systems.

### [12] [Attentive Convolution: Unifying the Expressivity of Self-Attention with Convolutional Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20092)
*Hao Yu,Haoyu Chen,Yan Jiang,Wei Peng,Zhaodong Sun,Samuel Kaski,Guoying Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Attentive Convolution (ATConv)，通过引入自适应路由和侧向抑制机制，使卷积操作具备自注意力的表达能力，同时保持线性复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制虽然表达能力强大，但二次复杂度限制了实际应用。传统卷积具有线性复杂度，但性能存在差距。本文旨在探索自注意力优于卷积的根本原因，并设计兼具两者优势的新方法。

Method: 提出ATConv，通过两个关键设计原则：(1) 自适应路由：根据语义内容动态调节位置信息流；(2) 侧向抑制：在token权重中引入竞争机制抑制冗余。基于ATConv构建AttNet网络家族。

Result: ATConv仅使用3×3卷积核，在基础视觉任务中持续超越各种自注意力机制。AttNet在ImageNet-1K上达到84.4%准确率（仅27M参数）。在扩散模型中替换自注意力，FID降低0.15且采样更快。

Conclusion: 通过重新审视卷积设计原则，ATConv成功将自注意力的核心优势融入卷积操作，在保持线性复杂度的同时实现了超越自注意力的性能。

Abstract: Self-attention (SA) has become the cornerstone of modern vision backbones for
its powerful expressivity over traditional Convolutions (Conv). However, its
quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for practical applications.
Given that Conv offers linear complexity and strong visual priors, continuing
efforts have been made to promote the renaissance of Conv. However, a
persistent performance chasm remains, highlighting that these modernizations
have not yet captured the intrinsic expressivity that defines SA. In this
paper, we re-examine the design of the CNNs, directed by a key question: what
principles give SA its edge over Conv? As a result, we reveal two fundamental
insights that challenge the long-standing design intuitions in prior research
(e.g., Receptive field). The two findings are: (1) \textit{Adaptive routing}:
SA dynamically regulates positional information flow according to semantic
content, whereas Conv employs static kernels uniformly across all positions.
(2) \textit{Lateral inhibition}: SA induces score competition among token
weighting, effectively suppressing redundancy and sharpening representations,
whereas Conv filters lack such inhibitory dynamics and exhibit considerable
redundancy. Based on this, we propose \textit{Attentive Convolution} (ATConv),
a principled reformulation of the convolutional operator that intrinsically
injects these principles. Interestingly, with only $3\times3$ kernels, ATConv
consistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in fundamental vision tasks.
Building on ATConv, we introduce AttNet, a CNN family that can attain
\textbf{84.4\%} ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with only 27M parameters. In
diffusion-based image generation, replacing all SA with the proposed $3\times
3$ ATConv in SiT-XL/2 reduces ImageNet FID by 0.15 in 400k steps with faster
sampling. Code is available at: github.com/price112/Attentive-Convolution.

*Jiho Park,Sieun Choi,Jaeyoon Seo,Jihie Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出StableSketcher框架，通过优化VAE编码器和引入基于VQA的奖励函数，使扩散模型能够生成具有高提示保真度的手绘草图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Although recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly enriched
the quality of generated images, challenges remain in synthesizing pixel-based
human-drawn sketches, a representative example of abstract expression. To
combat these challenges, we propose StableSketcher, a novel framework that
empowers diffusion models to generate hand-drawn sketches with high prompt
fidelity. Within this framework, we fine-tune the variational autoencoder to
optimize latent decoding, enabling it to better capture the characteristics of
sketches. In parallel, we integrate a new reward function for reinforcement
learning based on visual question answering, which improves text-image
alignment and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
StableSketcher generates sketches with improved stylistic fidelity, achieving
better alignment with prompts compared to the Stable Diffusion baseline.
Additionally, we introduce SketchDUO, to the best of our knowledge, the first
dataset comprising instance-level sketches paired with captions and
question-answer pairs, thereby addressing the limitations of existing datasets
that rely on image-label pairs. Our code and dataset will be made publicly
available upon acceptance.

Motivation: 在生物多模态基础模型中，图像和标题可被视为物种潜在形态空间的互补样本，各自捕捉特定的生物特征。但获取大规模、实例特定的忠实标题存在挑战，限制了自然语言监督在生物领域的应用。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型生成合成标题，结合维基百科的视觉信息和针对特定分类群的格式示例，减少幻觉并产生准确的实例描述性标题，然后利用这些标题训练BIOCAP模型。

Result: 训练出的BIOCAP模型能够捕捉丰富的语义信息，在物种分类和文本-图像检索任务中表现出强大的性能。

Conclusion: 描述性标题超越了传统标签的价值，能够有效连接生物图像与多模态基础模型，为生物多模态学习提供了新的监督范式。

Abstract: This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of
supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions
can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a
species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions
during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure,
emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious
correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful,
instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the
utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with
many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic
captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by
Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These
domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate,
instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BIOCAP
(i.e., BIOCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich
semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and
text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive
captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation
models.

Abstract: While computer vision has advanced considerably for general object detection
and tracking, the specific problem of fast-moving tiny objects remains
underexplored. This paper addresses the significant challenge of detecting and
tracking rapidly moving small objects using an RGB-D camera. Our novel system
combines deep learning-based detection with physics-based tracking to overcome
the limitations of existing approaches. Our contributions include: (1) a
comprehensive system design for object detection and tracking of fast-moving
small objects in 3D space, (2) an innovative physics-based tracking algorithm
that integrates kinematics motion equations to handle outliers and missed
detections, and (3) an outlier detection and correction module that
significantly improves tracking performance in challenging scenarios such as
occlusions and rapid direction changes. We evaluated our proposed system on a
custom racquetball dataset. Our evaluation shows our system surpassing kalman
filter based trackers with up to 70\% less Average Displacement Error. Our
system has significant applications for improving robot perception on
autonomous platforms and demonstrates the effectiveness of combining
physics-based models with deep learning approaches for real-time 3D detection
and tracking of challenging small objects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统光场获取需要计算成本或专用设备，限制了其应用范围。本文旨在从单张图像生成光场，扩展其适用性。

Method: 设计神经渲染管道，通过交叉注意力计算源光线之间的关系，预测目标光线颜色，并迭代更新生成的内容。

Result: 在多个挑战性数据集上表现良好，无需重新训练或微调，优于相关的最先进新视图合成方法。

Conclusion: 逆图像渲染方法能够有效地从单张图像生成光场，支持新视图合成和摄影效果，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: A concept of light-fields computed from multiple view images on regular grids
has proven its benefit for scene representations, and supported realistic
renderings of novel views and photographic effects such as refocusing and
shallow depth of field. In spite of its effectiveness of light flow
computations, obtaining light fields requires either computational costs or
specialized devices like a bulky camera setup and a specialized microlens
array. In an effort to broaden its benefit and applicability, in this paper, we
propose a novel view synthesis method for light field generation from only
single images, named inverse image-based rendering. Unlike previous attempts to
implicitly rebuild 3D geometry or to explicitly represent objective scenes, our
method reconstructs light flows in a space from image pixels, which behaves in
the opposite way to image-based rendering. To accomplish this, we design a
neural rendering pipeline to render a target ray in an arbitrary viewpoint. Our
neural renderer first stores the light flow of source rays from the input
image, then computes the relationships among them through cross-attention, and
finally predicts the color of the target ray based on these relationships.
After the rendering pipeline generates the first novel view from a single input
image, the generated out-of-view contents are updated to the set of source
rays. This procedure is iteratively performed while ensuring the consistent
generation of occluded contents. We demonstrate that our inverse image-based
rendering works well with various challenging datasets without any retraining
or finetuning after once trained on synthetic dataset, and outperforms relevant
state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods.

TL;DR: 提出LogitGap方法，通过利用最大logit与其余logit之间的关系来增强ID和OOD样本的可分性，在OOD检测中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的后处理方法未能充分利用模型logit空间中丰富的嵌入信息，需要更有效地利用logit空间来提升OOD检测性能。

Method: 提出LogitGap方法，显式利用最大logit与其余logit之间的关系；引入无训练策略自动识别最信息丰富的logit进行评分。

Result: 在视觉语言和纯视觉模型上的广泛实验表明，LogitGap在各种OOD检测场景和基准测试中始终实现最先进性能。

Conclusion: LogitGap通过有效利用logit空间中的关系，为OOD检测提供了高效且有效的解决方案，在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models in open-world applications. While post-hoc methods are
favored for their efficiency and ease of deployment, existing approaches often
underexploit the rich information embedded in the model's logits space. In this
paper, we propose LogitGap, a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that
explicitly exploits the relationship between the maximum logit and the
remaining logits to enhance the separability between in-distribution (ID) and
OOD samples. To further improve its effectiveness, we refine LogitGap by
focusing on a more compact and informative subset of the logit space.
Specifically, we introduce a training-free strategy that automatically
identifies the most informative logits for scoring. We provide both theoretical
analysis and empirical evidence to validate the effectiveness of our approach.
Extensive experiments on both vision-language and vision-only models
demonstrate that LogitGap consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance
across diverse OOD detection scenarios and benchmarks. Code is available at

Result: 在类无关部件分割任务中，现有方法在细粒度和叶级部件上表现不佳；在3D部件问答任务中，3D-LLMs在开放词汇部件定位方面存在显著差距；使用PartNeXt训练的Point-SAM相比PartNet有显著提升。

Conclusion: PartNeXt通过可扩展标注、纹理感知标签和多任务评估，为结构化3D理解研究开辟了新途径，展示了数据集在质量和多样性方面的优势。

Abstract: Understanding objects at the level of their constituent parts is fundamental
to advancing computer vision, graphics, and robotics. While datasets like
PartNet have driven progress in 3D part understanding, their reliance on
untextured geometries and expert-dependent annotation limits scalability and
usability. We introduce PartNeXt, a next-generation dataset addressing these
gaps with over 23,000 high-quality, textured 3D models annotated with
fine-grained, hierarchical part labels across 50 categories. We benchmark
PartNeXt on two tasks: (1) class-agnostic part segmentation, where
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., PartField, SAMPart3D) struggle with
fine-grained and leaf-level parts, and (2) 3D part-centric question answering,
a new benchmark for 3D-LLMs that reveals significant gaps in open-vocabulary
part grounding. Additionally, training Point-SAM on PartNeXt yields substantial
gains over PartNet, underscoring the dataset's superior quality and diversity.
By combining scalable annotation, texture-aware labels, and multi-task
evaluation, PartNeXt opens new avenues for research in structured 3D
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶中，骑行者属于易受伤害道路使用者，准确估计其姿态对意图分类、行为预测和碰撞避免至关重要。传统6D姿态估计无法处理自行车铰接部件的变化，因为车把和踏板的角度变化会影响3D边界框和实际行驶方向。

Method: 提出类别级8D姿态估计方法，联合估计8D姿态和3D关键点，使用合成和真实图像数据进行训练以提高泛化能力。

Result: 方法在估计8D姿态参数方面表现出有希望的结果，与使用刚性模板匹配的最先进6D姿态估计器相比取得了有竞争力的分数。

Conclusion: 8D姿态估计能够提供更细粒度的自行车姿态状态和行驶方向信息，比传统6D方法更适合处理铰接式自行车。

Abstract: In Autonomous Driving, cyclists belong to the safety-critical class of
Vulnerable Road Users (VRU), and accurate estimation of their pose is critical
for cyclist crossing intention classification, behavior prediction, and
collision avoidance. Unlike rigid objects, articulated bicycles are composed of
movable rigid parts linked by joints and constrained by a kinematic structure.
6D pose methods can estimate the 3D rotation and translation of rigid bicycles,
but 6D becomes insufficient when the steering/pedals angles of the bicycle
vary. That is because: 1) varying the articulated pose of the bicycle causes
its 3D bounding box to vary as well, and 2) the 3D box orientation is not
necessarily aligned to the orientation of the steering which determines the
actual intended travel direction. In this work, we introduce a method for
category-level 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a
single RGB image. Besides being able to estimate the 3D translation and
rotation of a bicycle from a single image, our method also estimates the
rotations of its steering handles and pedals with respect to the bicycle body
frame. These two new parameters enable the estimation of a more fine-grained
bicycle pose state and travel direction. Our proposed model jointly estimates
the 8D pose and the 3D Keypoints of articulated bicycles, and trains with a mix
of synthetic and real image data to generalize on real images. We include an
evaluation section where we evaluate the accuracy of our estimated 8D pose
parameters, and our method shows promising results by achieving competitive
scores when compared against state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators
that use rigid canonical object templates for matching.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的闭世界和开世界设置下均取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多模态知识积累和自适应原型更新，有效解决了组合零样本学习中的分布偏移问题，在多个数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel
attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones.
Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution
shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen
compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge,
we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both
textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal
prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update
weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to
flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic
priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire
visual knowledge from historical images for inference. Considering the semantic
consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by
multimodal collaborative representation learning. Extensive experiments
indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four
benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings. Code will

Result: 在dSprites和Color-dSprites数据集上达到与最先进β-VAE竞争的解耦分数，优于InfoGAN；在CelebA和3D Chairs数据集上生成样本的视觉质量和多样性更好，FID分数更优。

Conclusion: IB-GAN通过信息瓶颈框架有效提升了GAN的解耦表示学习能力，在解耦性能和生成质量方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: We propose a new GAN-based unsupervised model for disentangled representation
learning. The new model is discovered in an attempt to utilize the Information
Bottleneck (IB) framework to the optimization of GAN, thereby named IB-GAN. The
architecture of IB-GAN is partially similar to that of InfoGAN but has a
critical difference; an intermediate layer of the generator is leveraged to
constrain the mutual information between the input and the generated output.
The intermediate stochastic layer can serve as a learnable latent distribution
that is trained with the generator jointly in an end-to-end fashion. As a
result, the generator of IB-GAN can harness the latent space in a disentangled
and interpretable manner. With the experiments on dSprites and Color-dSprites
dataset, we demonstrate that IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores
to those of state-of-the-art \b{eta}-VAEs and outperforms InfoGAN. Moreover,
the visual quality and the diversity of samples generated by IB-GAN are often
better than those by \b{eta}-VAEs and Info-GAN in terms of FID score on CelebA

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 立体视频中的时间一致性深度估计对于增强现实等应用至关重要，但现有方法在建模长程时间依赖性和计算效率之间存在根本性权衡。

Method: 受人类两阶段决策过程启发，提出Pick-and-Play Memory模块：Pick过程选择最相关帧，Play过程自适应加权选中的帧进行时空聚合，维护紧凑且信息丰富的记忆缓冲区。

Result: 在Sintel数据集上，PPMStereo在clean/final测试集上分别达到0.62/1.11 TEPE，相比BiDAStereo提升17.3%和9.02%，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: PPMStereo通过两阶段协作过程实现了高效的长程时空一致性建模，在精度和时间一致性方面均达到最先进水平。

Abstract: Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for
real-world applications such as augmented reality, where inconsistent depth
estimation disrupts the immersion of users. Despite its importance, this task
remains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling long-term temporal
consistency in a computationally efficient manner. Previous methods attempt to
address this by aggregating spatio-temporal information but face a fundamental
trade-off: limited temporal modeling provides only modest gains, whereas
capturing long-range dependencies significantly increases computational cost.
To address this limitation, we introduce a memory buffer for modeling
long-range spatio-temporal consistency while achieving efficient dynamic stereo
matching. Inspired by the two-stage decision-making process in humans, we
propose a \textbf{P}ick-and-\textbf{P}lay \textbf{M}emory (PPM) construction
module for dynamic \textbf{Stereo} matching, dubbed as \textbf{PPMStereo}. PPM
consists of a `pick' process that identifies the most relevant frames and a
`play' process that weights the selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal
aggregation. This two-stage collaborative process maintains a compact yet
highly informative memory buffer while achieving temporally consistent
information aggregation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
PPMStereo, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
temporal consistency. % Notably, PPMStereo achieves 0.62/1.11 TEPE on the
Sintel clean/final (17.3\% \& 9.02\% improvements over BiDAStereo) with fewer
computational costs. Codes are available at

Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated high visual realism in
diverse contexts, spurring interest in their potential as general-purpose world
simulators. Existing benchmarks focus on individual subjects rather than scenes
with multiple interacting people. However, the plausibility of multi-agent
dynamics in generated videos remains unverified. We propose a rigorous
evaluation protocol to benchmark text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
models as implicit simulators of pedestrian dynamics. For I2V, we leverage
start frames from established datasets to enable comparison with a ground truth
video dataset. For T2V, we develop a prompt suite to explore diverse pedestrian
densities and interactions. A key component is a method to reconstruct 2D
bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters.
Our analysis reveals that leading models have learned surprisingly effective
priors for plausible multi-agent behavior. However, failure modes like merging
and disappearing people highlight areas for future improvement.

Motivation: 现有离散分类方法无法捕捉可疑意图的连续特性，限制了早期干预和可解释性。

Conclusion: 连续怀疑建模方法相比离散分类系统，能实现更早检测和主动干预，显著增强安全应用中的系统可解释性和实用性。

Abstract: Temporal Intention Localization (TIL) is crucial for video surveillance,
focusing on identifying varying levels of suspicious intentions to improve
security monitoring. However, existing discrete classification methods fail to
capture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early
intervention and explainability. In this paper, we propose the Suspicion
Progression Analysis Network (SPAN), which shifts from discrete classification
to continuous regression, enabling the capture of fluctuating and evolving
suspicious intentions. We reveal that suspicion exhibits long-term dependencies
and cumulative effects, similar to Temporal Point Process (TPP) theory. Based
on these insights, we define a suspicion score formula that models continuous
changes while accounting for temporal characteristics. We also introduce
Suspicion Coefficient Modulation, which adjusts suspicion coefficients using
multimodal information to reflect the varying impacts of suspicious actions.
Additionally, the Concept-Anchored Mapping method is proposed to link
suspicious actions to predefined intention concepts, offering insights into
both the actions and their potential underlying intentions. Extensive
experiments on the HAI dataset show that SPAN significantly outperforms
existing methods, reducing MSE by 19.8% and improving average mAP by 1.78%.
Notably, SPAN achieves a 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating
its superior ability to capture subtle behavioral changes. Compared to discrete
classification systems, our continuous suspicion modeling approach enables
earlier detection and proactive intervention, greatly enhancing system
explainability and practical utility in security applications.

Abstract: The development of foundation models for brain MRI depends critically on the
scale, diversity, and consistency of available data, yet systematic assessments
of these factors remain scarce. In this study, we analyze 54 publicly
accessible brain MRI datasets encompassing over 538,031 to provide a
structured, multi-level overview tailored to foundation model development. At
the dataset level, we characterize modality composition, disease coverage, and
dataset scale, revealing strong imbalances between large healthy cohorts and
smaller clinical populations. At the image level, we quantify voxel spacing,
orientation, and intensity distributions across 15 representative datasets,
demonstrating substantial heterogeneity that can influence representation
learning. We then perform a quantitative evaluation of preprocessing
variability, examining how intensity normalization, bias field correction,
skull stripping, spatial registration, and interpolation alter voxel statistics
and geometry. While these steps improve within-dataset consistency, residual
differences persist between datasets. Finally, feature-space case study using a
3D DenseNet121 shows measurable residual covariate shift after standardized
preprocessing, confirming that harmonization alone cannot eliminate
inter-dataset bias. Together, these analyses provide a unified characterization
of variability in public brain MRI resources and emphasize the need for
preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies in the design of
generalizable brain MRI foundation models.

large language model (LLM) fine-tuning to substantially improve T2V generation
without modifying the underlying generative backbone. In \textbf{Stage 1},
Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization (RAPO) enriches user prompts with
semantically relevant modifiers retrieved from a relation graph and refactors
them to match training distributions, enhancing compositionality and
multi-object fidelity. \textbf{Stage 2} introduces Sample-Specific Prompt
Optimization (SSPO), a closed-loop mechanism that iteratively refines prompts
using multi-source feedback -- including semantic alignment, spatial fidelity,
temporal coherence, and task-specific signals such as optical flow -- yielding
progressively improved video generation quality. \textbf{Stage 3} leverages
optimized prompt pairs from SSPO to fine-tune the rewriter LLM, internalizing
task-specific optimization patterns and enabling efficient, high-quality prompt
generation even before inference. Extensive experiments across five
state-of-the-art T2V models and five benchmarks demonstrate that RAPO++
achieves significant gains in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning,
temporal stability, and physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods
by large margins. Our results highlight RAPO++ as a model-agnostic,
cost-efficient, and scalable solution that sets a new standard for prompt
optimization in T2V generation. The code is available at

*Yanghao Wang,Zhen Wang,Long Chen*

TL;DR: FlowCycle是一个基于流的文本图像编辑框架，通过目标感知的中间状态和循环一致性优化，实现无需反演的图像编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本图像编辑方法采用目标无关的中间状态构建方式，主要关注源图像重建而忽视与特定编辑目标的语义差距，导致在需要大幅修改时编辑能力有限或不一致。

Method: 提出FlowCycle框架，通过可学习的噪声参数化破坏过程，并通过包含双重一致性约束的循环一致性过程进行优化：从源到目标的编辑和从目标回源的重建。

Result: 广泛的消融实验表明，FlowCycle在编辑质量和一致性方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: FlowCycle通过目标感知的中间状态和循环一致性优化，实现了忠实修改和源一致性的平衡，提升了文本图像编辑的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained text-to-image flow models have enabled
remarkable progress in text-based image editing. Mainstream approaches always
adopt a corruption-then-restoration paradigm, where the source image is first
corrupted into an ``intermediate state'' and then restored to the target image
under the prompt guidance. However, current methods construct this intermediate
state in a target-agnostic manner, i.e., they primarily focus on realizing
source image reconstruction while neglecting the semantic gaps towards the
specific editing target. This design inherently results in limited editability
or inconsistency when the desired modifications substantially deviate from the
source. In this paper, we argue that the intermediate state should be
target-aware, i.e., selectively corrupting editing-relevant contents while
preserving editing-irrelevant ones. To this end, we propose FlowCycle, a novel
inversion-free and flow-based editing framework that parameterizes corruption
with learnable noises and optimizes them through a cycle-consistent process. By
iteratively editing the source to the target and recovering back to the source
with dual consistency constraints, FlowCycle learns to produce a target-aware
intermediate state, enabling faithful modifications while preserving source
consistency. Extensive ablations have demonstrated that FlowCycle achieves
superior editing quality and consistency over state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统胎儿运动检测方法（如母体感知和胎心监护）存在主观性和准确性有限的问题，需要更可靠的客观检测方法。

Method: 使用自监督对比学习框架，结合空间和时间对比损失，采用任务特定采样策略，并通过概率微调方法实现灵活推理。

Result: 在92名受试者的30分钟超声数据集上，达到78.01%的敏感度和81.60%的AUROC。

Conclusion: 自监督对比学习在胎儿运动分析中具有潜力，为改进产前监测和临床决策铺平道路。

Abstract: Accurate fetal movement (FM) detection is essential for assessing prenatal
health, as abnormal movement patterns can indicate underlying complications
such as placental dysfunction or fetal distress. Traditional methods, including
maternal perception and cardiotocography (CTG), suffer from subjectivity and
limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Contrastive
Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL), a novel self-supervised
learning framework for FM detection from extended fetal ultrasound video
recordings. Our approach leverages a dual-contrastive loss, incorporating both
spatial and temporal contrastive learning, to learn robust motion
representations. Additionally, we introduce a task-specific sampling strategy,
ensuring the effective separation of movement and non-movement segments during
self-supervised training, while enabling flexible inference on arbitrarily long
ultrasound recordings through a probabilistic fine-tuning approach. Evaluated
on an in-house dataset of 92 subjects, each with 30-minute ultrasound sessions,
CURL achieves a sensitivity of 78.01% and an AUROC of 81.60%, demonstrating its
potential for reliable and objective FM analysis. These results highlight the
potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for fetal movement analysis,
paving the way for improved prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Adapting pretrained diffusion-based generative models for text-driven image
editing with negligible tuning overhead has demonstrated remarkable potential.
A classical adaptation paradigm, as followed by these methods, first infers the
generative trajectory inversely for a given source image by image inversion,
then performs image editing along the inferred trajectory guided by the target
text prompts. However, the performance of image editing is heavily limited by
the approximation errors introduced during image inversion by diffusion models,
which arise from the absence of exact supervision in the intermediate
generative steps. To circumvent this issue, we investigate the
parameter-efficient adaptation of VQ-based generative models for image editing,
and leverage their inherent characteristic that the exact intermediate
quantized representations of a source image are attainable, enabling more
effective supervision for precise image inversion. Specifically, we propose
\emph{EditInfinity}, which adapts \emph{Infinity}, a binary-quantized
generative model, for image editing. We propose an efficient yet effective
image inversion mechanism that integrates text prompting rectification and
image style preservation, enabling precise image inversion. Furthermore, we
devise a holistic smoothing strategy which allows our \emph{EditInfinity} to
perform image editing with high fidelity to source images and precise semantic
alignment to the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark
across "add", "change", and "delete" editing operations, demonstrate the
superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based
baselines. Code available at: https://github.com/yx-chen-ust/EditInfinity.

### [30] [Why LVLMs Are More Prone to Hallucinations in Longer Responses: The Role of Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20229)
*Ge Zheng,Jiaye Qian,Jiajin Tang,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出LVLM幻觉问题与生成长度无关，而是源于对上下文依赖的增加，并提出了"诱导-检测-抑制"框架来主动管理幻觉风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在生成长文本时出现更多幻觉，传统观点认为是长度导致的错误累积，但作者质疑是否存在更深层机制。

Method: 通过精心设计的上下文主动诱导幻觉，利用诱导实例进行早期高风险检测，并在实际解码过程中抑制潜在的对象级幻觉。

Result: 在所有基准测试中都取得了显著且一致的改进，验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 幻觉风险主要源于长文本中对上下文依赖的增加，而非长度本身，这为深入探索LVLM幻觉问题提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent
years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more
hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated
uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result
solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism?
After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the
risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased
reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses.
Building on these insights, we propose a novel "induce-detect-suppress"
framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed
contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases,
and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual
decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all
benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved
hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly,
re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance
gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step
toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.

Motivation: 现有的基于高斯泼溅的方法要么依赖单一3D语言场导致分割效果不佳，要么依赖预计算的类无关分割导致错误累积，需要解决这些限制。

Result: 在两个广泛使用的基准测试上表现出领先性能，并在新颖图像3D分割、分层分割和机器人应用方面显示出高潜力。

Conclusion: COS3D通过协作场框架有效解决了开放词汇3D分割的挑战，在多个应用场景中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging task,
requiring a mutual understanding of both segmentation and language. However,
existing Gaussian-splatting-based methods rely either on a single 3D language
field, leading to inferior segmentation, or on pre-computed class-agnostic
segmentations, suffering from error accumulation. To address these limitations,
we present COS3D, a new collaborative prompt-segmentation framework that
contributes to effectively integrating complementary language and segmentation
cues throughout its entire pipeline. We first introduce the new concept of
collaborative field, comprising an instance field and a language field, as the
cornerstone for collaboration. During training, to effectively construct the
collaborative field, our key idea is to capture the intrinsic relationship
between the instance field and language field, through a novel
instance-to-language feature mapping and designing an efficient two-stage
training strategy. During inference, to bridge distinct characteristics of the
two fields, we further design an adaptive language-to-instance prompt
refinement, promoting high-quality prompt-segmentation inference. Extensive
experiments not only demonstrate COS3D's leading performance over existing
methods on two widely-used benchmarks but also show its high potential to
various applications,~\ie, novel image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical
segmentation, and robotics. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了DualGround双分支架构，通过分离全局和局部语义来改进视频时序定位任务，在Moment Retrieval和Highlight Detection任务上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理跨模态注意力时对所有文本标记一视同仁，忽视了它们不同的语义角色，导致模型过度依赖[EOS]驱动的全局语义而未能有效利用词级信号，限制了细粒度时序对齐能力。

Method: 双分支架构：将[EOS]标记通过句子级路径处理，将词标记聚类为短语级单元进行局部定位；引入基于标记角色的跨模态交互策略和联合建模框架。

Result: 在QVHighlights和Charades-STA基准测试中，DualGround在Moment Retrieval和Highlight Detection任务上均达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 解耦的语义建模在视频-语言对齐中非常有效，能够同时捕获粗粒度和局部语义，实现更具表达力和上下文感知的视频定位。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize temporal segments in long,
untrimmed videos that align with a given natural language query. This task
typically comprises two subtasks: Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection
(HD). While recent advances have been progressed by powerful pretrained
vision-language models such as CLIP and InternVideo2, existing approaches
commonly treat all text tokens uniformly during crossmodal attention,
disregarding their distinct semantic roles. To validate the limitations of this
approach, we conduct controlled experiments demonstrating that VTG models
overly rely on [EOS]-driven global semantics while failing to effectively
utilize word-level signals, which limits their ability to achieve fine-grained
temporal alignment. Motivated by this limitation, we propose DualGround, a
dual-branch architecture that explicitly separates global and local semantics
by routing the [EOS] token through a sentence-level path and clustering word
tokens into phrase-level units for localized grounding. Our method introduces
(1) tokenrole- aware cross modal interaction strategies that align video
features with sentence-level and phrase-level semantics in a structurally
disentangled manner, and (2) a joint modeling framework that not only improves
global sentence-level alignment but also enhances finegrained temporal
grounding by leveraging structured phrase-aware context. This design allows the
model to capture both coarse and localized semantics, enabling more expressive
and context-aware video grounding. DualGround achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across
QVHighlights and Charades- STA benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
disentangled semantic modeling in video-language alignment.

Motivation: 现有方法基于关键点的位置编码仅捕获2D坐标而忽略物体形状信息，对标注偏移敏感且跨视角匹配能力有限。

Method: 提出掩码位置编码方案利用分割掩码捕获空间坐标和物体轮廓；设计上下文增强模块使用水平和垂直条带卷积核提取长距离上下文特征。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上实现最先进性能，在挑战性的地面到卫星场景下定位精度提升3.39%。

Conclusion: 为跨视角地理定位研究提供了鲁棒的位置编码范式和上下文建模框架。

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization enables high-precision object localization
through cross-view matching, with critical applications in autonomous driving,
urban management, and disaster response. However, existing methods rely on
keypoint-based positional encoding, which captures only 2D coordinates while
neglecting object shape information, resulting in sensitivity to annotation
shifts and limited cross-view matching capability. To address these
limitations, we propose a mask-based positional encoding scheme that leverages
segmentation masks to capture both spatial coordinates and object silhouettes,
thereby upgrading the model from "location-aware" to "object-aware."
Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of large-span objects (e.g., elongated
buildings) in satellite imagery, we design a context enhancement module. This
module employs horizontal and vertical strip convolutional kernels to extract
long-range contextual features, enhancing feature discrimination among
strip-like objects. Integrating MPE and CEM, we present EDGeo, an end-to-end
framework for robust cross-view object geo-localization. Extensive experiments
on two public datasets (CVOGL and VIGOR-Building) demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 3.39% improvement in localization
accuracy under challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios. This work provides a
robust positional encoding paradigm and a contextual modeling framework for
advancing cross-view geo-localization research.

Conclusion: CMC能有效缓解文本主导问题，引导融合过程达成更可靠的多模态共识，提升情感识别性能

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) has made substantial
progress. Nevertheless, most existing approaches neglect the semantic
inconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional
cues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often
dominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity,
which can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we
propose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a
Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels,
enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a
Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for
multimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion
process toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that
CMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods
across four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and
exhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on
CH-SIMS and CH-SIMS v2. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible

Abstract: Technologies like smartphones have become an essential in our daily lives. It
has made accessible to everyone including visually impaired individuals. With
the use of smartphone cameras, image capturing and processing have become more

Method: 基于视频片段生成细粒度多模态特征，总结主要内容，并引入原始视频字幕的文本特征来增强视觉特征的突出部分

Result: 在四个主要数据集上实现了最先进的性能，消融实验验证了性能提升确实源于冗余信息的减少

Conclusion: GMFVAD通过细粒度多模态特征有效减少了视频异常检测中的冗余信息，显著提升了检测性能

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous
frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the
spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are
abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce
multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video
anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into
video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of
redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we
propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further
refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and
we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD).
Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video
snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the
captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual
features of highlighted portions. Experiments show that the proposed GMFVAD
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mainly datasets. Ablation
experiments also validate that the improvement of GMFVAD is due to the
reduction of redundant information.

Abstract: Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) refers to answering questions and
providing explanations based on images. While existing methods achieve high
prediction accuracy, they often overlook bias in datasets and lack debiasing
strategies. In this paper, our analysis reveals co-occurrence and statistical
biases in both textual and visual data. We introduce the VCR-OOD datasets,
comprising VCR-OOD-QA and VCR-OOD-VA subsets, which are designed to evaluate
the generalization capabilities of models across two modalities. Furthermore,
we analyze the causal graphs and prediction shortcuts in VCR and adopt a
backdoor adjustment method to remove bias. Specifically, we create a dictionary
based on the set of correct answers to eliminate prediction shortcuts.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our debiasing method across
different datasets.

Conclusion: KINN有效解决了表示三难问题，为SAR图像分析中的可信AI提供了新路径。

Abstract: Deep learning models for complex-valued Synthetic Aperture Radar (CV-SAR)
image recognition are fundamentally constrained by a representation trilemma
under data-limited and domain-shift scenarios: the concurrent, yet conflicting,
optimization of generalization, interpretability, and efficiency. Our work is
motivated by the premise that the rich electromagnetic scattering features
inherent in CV-SAR data hold the key to resolving this trilemma, yet they are
insufficiently harnessed by conventional data-driven models. To this end, we
introduce the Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN), a lightweight framework
built upon a novel "compression-aggregation-compression" architecture. The
first stage performs a physics-guided compression, wherein a novel dictionary
processor adaptively embeds physical priors, enabling a compact unfolding
network to efficiently extract sparse, physically-grounded signatures. A
subsequent aggregation module enriches these representations, followed by a
final semantic compression stage that utilizes a compact classification head
with self-distillation to learn maximally task-relevant and discriminative
embeddings. We instantiate KINN in both CNN (0.7M) and Vision Transformer
(0.95M) variants. Extensive evaluations on five SAR benchmarks confirm that
KINN establishes a state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient recognition,
offering exceptional generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution
scenarios and tangible interpretability, thereby providing an effective
solution to the representation trilemma and offering a new path for trustworthy
AI in SAR image analysis.

TL;DR: 提出了DMC³框架，通过反事实样本构建和对比优化解决第一人称视频问答中的多事件理解和手物交互识别挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了第一人称视角带来的独特挑战，如理解多个事件和识别手物交互

Method: DMC³框架包含三个模块：基准模型、反事实样本构建模块（通过事件描述改写和核心交互挖掘生成正负样本）、反事实样本参与的对比优化模块

Result: 在EgoTaskQA的normal和indirect分割上分别达到52.51%和46.04%，在QAEGO4D上达到13.2%，均达到最先进性能

Conclusion: DMC³框架通过反事实样本构建和对比优化有效提升了第一人称视频问答的性能

Abstract: Egocentric Video Question Answering (Egocentric VideoQA) plays an important
role in egocentric video understanding, which refers to answering questions
based on first-person videos. Although existing methods have made progress
through the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning, they ignore the unique
challenges posed by the first-person perspective, such as understanding
multiple events and recognizing hand-object interactions. To deal with these
challenges, we propose a Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction
(DMC$^3$) framework, which contains an egocentric videoqa baseline, a
counterfactual sample construction module and a counterfactual sample-involved
contrastive optimization. Specifically, We first develop a counterfactual
sample construction module to generate positive and negative samples for
textual and visual modalities through event description paraphrasing and core
interaction mining, respectively. Then, We feed these samples together with the
original samples into the baseline. Finally, in the counterfactual
sample-involved contrastive optimization module, we apply contrastive loss to
minimize the distance between the original sample features and the positive
sample features, while maximizing the distance from the negative samples.
Experiments show that our method achieve 52.51\% and 46.04\% on the
\textit{normal} and \textit{indirect} splits of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2\% on
QAEGO4D, both reaching the state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 提出Instruction-as-Reasoning范式，将指令视为动态分析路径，通过两阶段训练框架（SFT+RL）优化路径选择和组合，在GUI grounding任务上取得SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作将指令视为用户意图的静态代理，忽视了指令多样性和质量对grounding性能的影响。研究发现现有数据集中23.3%的指令存在缺陷，利用指令多样性可在推理时获得76%的相对性能提升。

Method: 采用两阶段训练框架：首先在合成的多样化指令上进行监督微调，培养多视角推理能力；然后通过强化学习优化路径选择和组合。

Result: UI-Ins-7B和UI-Ins-32B在五个挑战性grounding基准测试中取得SOTA结果，UI-Ins-32B在UI-I2E-Bench、ScreenSpot-Pro和MMBench-GUI L2上分别达到87.3%、57.0%和84.9%的准确率。UI-Ins-7B在AndroidWorld上达到74.1%的成功率。

Conclusion: Instruction-as-Reasoning范式能有效提升GUI grounding性能，模型展现出新兴推理能力，能够在推理时选择性地组合和合成新的指令路径。

Abstract: GUI grounding, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable UI
elements, is a core capability of GUI agents. Prior works largely treats
instructions as a static proxy for user intent, overlooking the impact of
instruction diversity and quality on grounding performance. Through a careful
investigation of existing grounding datasets, we find a 23.3% flaw rate in
their instructions and show that inference-time exploitation of instruction
diversity yields up to a substantial 76% relative performance improvement. In
this paper, we introduce the Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm, treating
instructions as dynamic analytical pathways that offer distinct perspectives
and enabling the model to select the most effective pathway during reasoning.
To achieve this, we propose a two-stage training framework: supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on synthesized, diverse instructions to instill
multi-perspective reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to
optimize pathway selection and composition. Our resulting models, UI-Ins-7B and
UI-Ins-32B, achieve state-of-the-art results on five challenging grounding
benchmarks and exhibit emergent reasoning, selectively composing and
synthesizing novel instruction pathways at inference. In particular, UI-Ins-32B
attains the best grounding accuracy, scoring 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on
ScreenSpot-Pro, and 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2. Furthermore, our model
demonstrates strong agentic potential, achieving a 74.1% success rate on
AndroidWorld using UI-Ins-7B as the executor. Our in-depth analysis reveals
additional insights such as how reasoning can be formulated to enhance rather
than hinder grounding performance, and how our method mitigates policy collapse
in the SFT+RL framework. All code and model checkpoints will be publicly
released in https://github.com/alibaba/UI-Ins.

Abstract: We present a winning solution to RoboSense 2025 Track 4: Cross-Modal Drone
Navigation. The task retrieves the most relevant geo-referenced image from a
large multi-platform corpus (satellite/drone/ground) given a natural-language
query. Two obstacles are severe inter-platform heterogeneity and a domain gap
between generic training descriptions and platform-specific test queries. We
mitigate these with a domain-aligned preprocessing pipeline and a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework: (i) platform-wise partitioning, satellite
augmentation, and removal of orientation words; (ii) an LLM-based caption
refinement pipeline to align textual semantics with the distinct visual
characteristics of each platform. Using BGE-M3 (text) and EVA-CLIP (image), we
train three platform experts using a progressive two-stage, hard-negative
mining strategy to enhance discriminative power, and fuse their scores at
inference. The system tops the official leaderboard, demonstrating robust
cross-modal geo-localization under heterogeneous viewpoints.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperET提出了一种高效的多模态大语言模型训练范式，利用双曲空间动态调整半径来优化视觉表示，使其在任意粒度级别上与文本对齐，仅需增加不到1%的参数即可显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs需要大量计算资源进行训练，主要原因是广泛使用的视觉编码器（如CLIP、SAM）缺乏在多层次粒度上与语言的对齐能力。

Method: 利用双曲空间建模层次结构，通过动态双曲半径调整优化视觉表示；采用可学习矩阵和Möbius乘法操作，提供三种高效参数化策略：对角缩放矩阵、块对角矩阵和带状矩阵。

Result: 在多个MLLM基准测试中，HyperET始终显著改善现有预训练和微调MLLMs的性能，仅增加不到1%的参数。

Conclusion: 双曲空间为视觉和文本模态之间的粒度差距提供了原则性框架，HyperET通过高效参数化策略实现了跨模态对齐，大幅提升了训练效率。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a transformative
approach for aligning visual and textual understanding. They typically require
extremely high computational resources (e.g., thousands of GPUs) for training
to achieve cross-modal alignment at multi-granularity levels. We argue that a
key source of this inefficiency lies in the vision encoders they widely equip
with, e.g., CLIP and SAM, which lack the alignment with language at
multi-granularity levels. To address this issue, in this paper, we leverage
hyperbolic space, which inherently models hierarchical levels and thus provides
a principled framework for bridging the granularity gap between visual and
textual modalities at an arbitrary granularity level. Concretely, we propose an
efficient training paradigm for MLLMs, dubbed as HyperET, which can optimize
visual representations to align with their textual counterparts at an arbitrary
granularity level through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic
space. HyperET employs learnable matrices with M\"{o}bius multiplication
operations, implemented via three effective configurations: diagonal scaling
matrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices, providing a flexible
yet efficient parametrization strategy. Comprehensive experiments across
multiple MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that HyperET consistently improves both
existing pre-training and fine-tuning MLLMs clearly with less than 1\%
additional parameters.

TL;DR: AnyPcc是一个通用的点云压缩框架，通过通用上下文模型和实例自适应微调策略解决泛化问题，在15个数据集上实现了最先进的压缩性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于深度学习的点云几何压缩中的泛化挑战，主要源于缺乏鲁棒的上下文模型和对分布外数据处理的低效。

Method: 采用通用上下文模型捕捉空间和通道分组先验，并提出实例自适应微调策略，结合显式和隐式压缩范式，为每个实例微调少量网络权重。

Result: 在包含15个不同数据集的基准测试中，AnyPcc在点云压缩方面达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: AnyPcc通过鲁棒的上下文建模和高效的OOD数据处理，显著提升了点云压缩的泛化能力，为可重现研究提供了代码和数据集。

Abstract: Generalization remains a critical challenge for deep learning-based point
cloud geometry compression. We argue this stems from two key limitations: the
lack of robust context models and the inefficient handling of
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To address both, we introduce AnyPcc, a
universal point cloud compression framework. AnyPcc first employs a Universal
Context Model that leverages priors from both spatial and channel-wise grouping
to capture robust contextual dependencies. Second, our novel Instance-Adaptive
Fine-Tuning (IAFT) strategy tackles OOD data by synergizing explicit and
implicit compression paradigms. It fine-tunes a small subset of network weights
for each instance and incorporates them into the bitstream, where the marginal
bit cost of the weights is dwarfed by the resulting savings in geometry
compression. Extensive experiments on a benchmark of 15 diverse datasets
confirm that AnyPcc sets a new state-of-the-art in point cloud compression. Our
code and datasets will be released to encourage reproducible research.

TL;DR: AccuQuant是一种用于扩散模型的新型后训练量化方法，通过模拟多步去噪过程来最小化量化误差累积，显著提高量化模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在采样过程中，量化误差会在多个去噪步骤中累积，导致性能下降。现有方法独立处理每个步骤的误差，无法有效解决累积问题。

Method: AccuQuant通过模拟扩散采样过程中的多个去噪步骤，显式考虑多步误差累积，并提出了高效实现技术将内存复杂度从O(n)降低到O(1)。

Result: 在多个任务和扩散模型的标准基准测试中，AccuQuant表现出优异的效能和效率。

Conclusion: AccuQuant通过有效处理量化误差累积问题，为扩散模型的高效量化提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We present in this paper a novel post-training quantization (PTQ) method,
dubbed AccuQuant, for diffusion models. We show analytically and empirically
that quantization errors for diffusion models are accumulated over denoising
steps in a sampling process. To alleviate the error accumulation problem,
AccuQuant minimizes the discrepancies between outputs of a full-precision
diffusion model and its quantized version within a couple of denoising steps.
That is, it simulates multiple denoising steps of a diffusion sampling process
explicitly for quantization, accounting the accumulated errors over multiple
denoising steps, which is in contrast to previous approaches to imitating a
training process of diffusion models, namely, minimizing the discrepancies
independently for each step. We also present an efficient implementation
technique for AccuQuant, together with a novel objective, which reduces a
memory complexity significantly from $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$,
where $n$ is the number of denoising steps. We demonstrate the efficacy and
efficiency of AccuQuant across various tasks and diffusion models on standard
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文发现扩散变换器(DiTs)中的补丁标记具有高度独立性，空间一致性主要由位置编码控制。作者提出位置编码场(PE-Field)，将2D位置编码扩展到结构化3D场，使DiTs能够在3D空间中直接建模几何。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视DiTs如何组织视觉内容，发现补丁标记具有惊人独立性：即使位置编码被扰动，DiTs仍能产生全局一致输出，表明空间一致性主要由位置编码控制。

Method: 引入位置编码场(PE-Field)，将位置编码从2D平面扩展到结构化3D场，包含用于体积推理的深度感知编码和用于细粒度子补丁控制的分层编码。

Result: PE-Field增强的DiT在单图像新视角合成任务上达到最先进性能，并能推广到可控空间图像编辑。

Conclusion: PE-Field使DiTs能够在3D空间中直接建模几何，为视觉生成提供了更强大的空间表示能力。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the dominant architecture for
visual generation, powering state-of-the-art image and video models. By
representing images as patch tokens with positional encodings (PEs), DiTs
combine Transformer scalability with spatial and temporal inductive biases. In
this work, we revisit how DiTs organize visual content and discover that patch
tokens exhibit a surprising degree of independence: even when PEs are
perturbed, DiTs still produce globally coherent outputs, indicating that
spatial coherence is primarily governed by PEs. Motivated by this finding, we
introduce the Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field), which extends positional
encodings from the 2D plane to a structured 3D field. PE-Field incorporates
depth-aware encodings for volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for
fine-grained sub-patch control, enabling DiTs to model geometry directly in 3D
space. Our PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on
single-image novel view synthesis and generalizes to controllable spatial image
editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新的因果方法，通过预测图像中可能被忽略的烹饪元素，并将这些元素显式注入跨模态表示学习来缓解偏见，提升图像到食谱检索的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像到食谱检索方法假设食物图像能完全捕捉食谱的文本细节，但实际上图像只反映烹饪结果而非过程，导致表示学习偏向主导视觉元素，难以区分具有细微差异的相似食谱。

Method: 提出因果表示学习方法，预测图像中可能被忽略的烹饪元素（如细微配料和烹饪动作），并将这些元素显式注入跨模态表示学习以缓解偏见。

Result: 在标准单语Recipe1M数据集和新构建的多语言多文化数据集上的实验表明，该方法能够发现细微的配料和烹饪动作，并在单语和多语言多文化数据集上都取得了令人印象深刻的检索性能。

Conclusion: 因果表示学习方法能有效缓解图像到食谱检索中的表示偏见，提升对细微烹饪元素的识别能力，在单语和多语言多文化场景下都表现出色。

Abstract: Existing approaches for image-to-recipe retrieval have the implicit
assumption that a food image can fully capture the details textually documented
in its recipe. However, a food image only reflects the visual outcome of a
cooked dish and not the underlying cooking process. Consequently, learning
cross-modal representations to bridge the modality gap between images and
recipes tends to ignore subtle, recipe-specific details that are not visually
apparent but are crucial for recipe retrieval. Specifically, the
representations are biased to capture the dominant visual elements, resulting
in difficulty in ranking similar recipes with subtle differences in use of
ingredients and cooking methods. The bias in representation learning is
expected to be more severe when the training data is mixed of images and
recipes sourced from different cuisines. This paper proposes a novel causal
approach that predicts the culinary elements potentially overlooked in images,
while explicitly injecting these elements into cross-modal representation
learning to mitigate biases. Experiments are conducted on the standard
monolingual Recipe1M dataset and a newly curated multilingual multicultural
cuisine dataset. The results indicate that the proposed causal representation
learning is capable of uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions and
achieves impressive retrieval performance on both monolingual and multilingual
multicultural datasets.

Abstract: This paper presents the FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet model, a novel approach for
lung cancer (LC) classification, leveraging dynamic fuzzy logic-driven
knowledge distillation (KD) to address uncertainty and complexity in disease
diagnosis. Unlike traditional models that rely on static KD with fixed weights,
our method dynamically adjusts the distillation weight using fuzzy logic,
enabling the student model to focus on high-confidence regions while reducing
attention to ambiguous areas. This dynamic adjustment improves the model
ability to handle varying uncertainty levels across different regions of LC
images. We employ the Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the instructor model,
which effectively transfers knowledge to the student model, MobileNet,
enhancing the student generalization capabilities. The training process is
further optimized using a dynamic wait adjustment mechanism that adapts the
training procedure for improved convergence and performance. To enhance image
quality, we introduce pixel-level image fusion improvement techniques such as
Gamma correction and Histogram Equalization. The processed images (Pix1 and
Pix2) are fused using a wavelet-based fusion method to improve image resolution
and feature preservation. This fusion method uses the wavedec2 function to
standardize images to a 224x224 resolution, decompose them into multi-scale
frequency components, and recursively average coefficients at each level for
better feature representation. To address computational efficiency, Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is used to select the most suitable pre-trained student model
from a pool of 12 candidates, balancing model performance with computational
cost. The model is evaluated on two datasets, including LC25000
histopathological images (99.16% accuracy) and IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images
(99.54% accuracy), demonstrating robustness across different imaging domains.

TL;DR: Conan是一个基于证据的多步视频推理框架，通过识别上下文和证据帧、跨帧线索推理以及自适应决策来解决MLLMs在视频推理中的挑战，在多个基准测试中比基线模型准确率平均提升超过10%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在视频推理中的两个主要问题：基于强化学习的方法产生无根据或幻觉的结论，以及帧检索方法在证据定位上的不准确性。

Method: 构建Conan-91K大规模自动生成推理轨迹数据集，设计多阶段渐进冷启动策略和Identification-Reasoning-Action强化学习训练框架，联合增强多步视觉推理能力。

Result: 在六个多步推理基准测试中，Conan比基线Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct平均准确率提升超过10%，达到最先进性能，并在长视频理解任务中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Conan框架通过证据基础的多步推理机制，显著提升了视频推理的准确性和可靠性，展现出强大的可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Video reasoning, which requires multi-step deduction across frames, remains a
major challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While
reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods enhance reasoning capabilities, they
often rely on text-only chains that yield ungrounded or hallucinated
conclusions. Conversely, frame-retrieval approaches introduce visual grounding
but still struggle with inaccurate evidence localization. To address these
challenges, we present Conan, a framework for evidence-grounded multi-step
video reasoning. Conan identifies contextual and evidence frames, reasons over
cross-frame clues, and adaptively decides when to conclude or explore further.
To achieve this, we (1) construct Conan-91K, a large-scale dataset of
automatically generated reasoning traces that includes frame identification,
evidence reasoning, and action decision, and (2) design a multi-stage
progressive cold-start strategy combined with an
Identification-Reasoning-Action (AIR) RLVR training framework to jointly
enhance multi-step visual reasoning. Extensive experiments on six multi-step
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Conan surpasses the baseline
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by an average of over 10% in accuracy, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, Conan generalizes effectively to
long-video understanding tasks, validating its strong scalability and
robustness.

Conclusion: 这项工作为公平性审计中的人口属性推断提供了可靠基础，通过公开数据集元数据、代码库、预训练模型和评估工具包促进透明度和可复现性。

Abstract: Fairness evaluation in face analysis systems (FAS) typically depends on
automatic demographic attribute inference (DAI), which itself relies on
predefined demographic segmentation. However, the validity of fairness auditing
hinges on the reliability of the DAI process. We begin by providing a
theoretical motivation for this dependency, showing that improved DAI
reliability leads to less biased and lower-variance estimates of FAS fairness.
To address this, we propose a fully reproducible DAI pipeline that replaces
conventional end-to-end training with a modular transfer learning approach. Our
design integrates pretrained face recognition encoders with non-linear
classification heads. We audit this pipeline across three dimensions: accuracy,
fairness, and a newly introduced notion of robustness, defined via
intra-identity consistency. The proposed robustness metric is applicable to any
demographic segmentation scheme. We benchmark the pipeline on gender and
ethnicity inference across multiple datasets and training setups. Our results
show that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines, particularly on
ethnicity, which is the more challenging attribute. To promote transparency and
reproducibility, we will publicly release the training dataset metadata, full
codebase, pretrained models, and evaluation toolkit. This work contributes a
reliable foundation for demographic inference in fairness auditing.

TL;DR: EchoDistill是一个双向概念蒸馏框架，用于实现一步扩散个性化，通过师生模型的协同训练和双向反馈机制，在保持生成质量的同时显著加速个性化过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的一步扩散模型在个性化新概念时存在容量限制，难以有效捕捉新概念的分布，需要一种既能保持生成质量又能快速个性化的方法。

Method: 提出双向概念蒸馏框架，同时训练多步扩散模型（教师）和一步扩散模型（学生），通过共享文本编码器确保语义一致性，并引入双向回声精炼策略让学生模型反馈给教师模型。

Result: 实验表明该框架在1-SDP设置下显著优于现有个性化方法，不仅提升了学生模型对新概念的个性化能力，还改善了教师模型的生成质量。

Conclusion: EchoDistill为T2I扩散模型建立了一种快速有效个性化的新范式，通过双向概念蒸馏机制实现了高质量的一步扩散个性化。

Abstract: Recent advances in accelerating text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have
enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images even in a single step. However,
personalizing these models to incorporate novel concepts remains a challenge
due to the limited capacity of one-step models to capture new concept
distributions effectively. We propose a bidirectional concept distillation
framework, EchoDistill, to enable one-step diffusion personalization (1-SDP).
Our approach involves an end-to-end training process where a multi-step
diffusion model (teacher) and a one-step diffusion model (student) are trained
simultaneously. The concept is first distilled from the teacher model to the
student, and then echoed back from the student to the teacher. During the
EchoDistill, we share the text encoder between the two models to ensure
consistent semantic understanding. Following this, the student model is
optimized with adversarial losses to align with the real image distribution and
with alignment losses to maintain consistency with the teacher's output.
Furthermore, we introduce the bidirectional echoing refinement strategy,
wherein the student model leverages its faster generation capability to
feedback to the teacher model. This bidirectional concept distillation
mechanism not only enhances the student ability to personalize novel concepts
but also improves the generative quality of the teacher model. Our experiments
demonstrate that this collaborative framework significantly outperforms
existing personalization methods over the 1-SDP setup, establishing a novel
paradigm for rapid and effective personalization in T2I diffusion models.

Conclusion: 建立了一个构建强大且多功能多模态大语言模型的新范式，有效解决了推理与泛化之间的普遍困境。

Abstract: Inspired by recent advancements in LLM reasoning, the field of multimodal
reasoning has seen remarkable progress, achieving significant performance gains
on intricate tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Despite this progress,
current multimodal large reasoning models exhibit two key limitations. They
tend to employ computationally expensive reasoning even for simple queries,
leading to inefficiency. Furthermore, this focus on specialized reasoning often
impairs their broader, more general understanding capabilities. In this paper,
we propose Metis-HOME: a Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts framework designed
to address this trade-off. Metis-HOME enables a ''Hybrid Thinking'' paradigm by
structuring the original dense model into two distinct expert branches: a
thinking branch tailored for complex, multi-step reasoning, and a non-thinking
branch optimized for rapid, direct inference on tasks like general VQA and OCR.
A lightweight, trainable router dynamically allocates queries to the most
suitable expert. We instantiate Metis-HOME by adapting the Qwen2.5-VL-7B into
an MoE architecture. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that our approach not
only substantially enhances complex reasoning abilities but also improves the
model's general capabilities, reversing the degradation trend observed in other
reasoning-specialized models. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building
powerful and versatile MLLMs, effectively resolving the prevalent
reasoning-vs-generalization dilemma.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Fake-in-Facext (FiFa)框架，通过细粒度面部区域划分和伪影定位解释任务，解决了现有可解释深度伪造分析方法缺乏细粒度感知的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在可解释深度伪造分析中存在细粒度感知不足的问题：数据标注不可靠且粗粒度，模型无法输出文本伪造解释与视觉伪影证据之间的连接，也不支持任意面部区域的查询输入。

Method: 定义了面部图像概念树(FICT)来细粒度划分面部区域，构建了FiFa-Annotator数据标注流程；提出了伪影定位解释(AGE)任务，生成带有分割掩码的文本伪造解释；设计了FiFa-MLLM统一多任务学习架构，支持丰富的多模态输入输出。

Result: FiFa-MLLM在AGE任务上优于强基线模型，在现有XDFA数据集上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FiFa框架通过细粒度数据标注和统一多任务架构，显著提升了可解释深度伪造分析的性能，为深度伪造检测提供了更可靠的可解释性支持。

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has bridged the
gap between vision and language tasks, enabling the implementation of
Explainable DeepFake Analysis (XDFA). However, current methods suffer from a
lack of fine-grained awareness: the description of artifacts in data annotation
is unreliable and coarse-grained, and the models fail to support the output of
connections between textual forgery explanations and the visual evidence of
artifacts, as well as the input of queries for arbitrary facial regions. As a
result, their responses are not sufficiently grounded in Face Visual Context
(Facext). To address this limitation, we propose the Fake-in-Facext (FiFa)
framework, with contributions focusing on data annotation and model
construction. We first define a Facial Image Concept Tree (FICT) to divide
facial images into fine-grained regional concepts, thereby obtaining a more
reliable data annotation pipeline, FiFa-Annotator, for forgery explanation.
Based on this dedicated data annotation, we introduce a novel
Artifact-Grounding Explanation (AGE) task, which generates textual forgery
explanations interleaved with segmentation masks of manipulated artifacts. We
propose a unified multi-task learning architecture, FiFa-MLLM, to
simultaneously support abundant multimodal inputs and outputs for fine-grained
Explainable DeepFake Analysis. With multiple auxiliary supervision tasks,
FiFa-MLLM can outperform strong baselines on the AGE task and achieve SOTA
performance on existing XDFA datasets. The code and data will be made
open-source at https://github.com/lxq1000/Fake-in-Facext.

TL;DR: 提出一种深度学习框架，从单张模糊图像联合估计潜在清晰图像和相机运动轨迹，在严重或空间变化模糊情况下达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机抖动导致的大范围或旋转运动引起的运动模糊仍然是图像恢复中的主要挑战，特别是在严重或空间变化模糊情况下，端到端去模糊网络表现不佳。

Method: 利用投影运动模糊模型(PMBM)，通过可微分模糊创建模块实现。神经网络预测完整的3D旋转轨迹，指导基于模型的端到端训练恢复网络，并通过重新模糊损失优化轨迹。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上均达到最先进性能，特别是在严重或空间变化模糊情况下表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法通过联合估计清晰图像和相机运动轨迹，提供了可解释性，并能重建生成模糊图像的清晰图像序列，在复杂模糊情况下优于端到端方法。

Abstract: Motion blur caused by camera shake, particularly under large or rotational
movements, remains a major challenge in image restoration. We propose a deep
learning framework that jointly estimates the latent sharp image and the
underlying camera motion trajectory from a single blurry image. Our method
leverages the Projective Motion Blur Model (PMBM), implemented efficiently
using a differentiable blur creation module compatible with modern networks. A
neural network predicts a full 3D rotation trajectory, which guides a
model-based restoration network trained end-to-end. This modular architecture
provides interpretability by revealing the camera motion that produced the
blur. Moreover, this trajectory enables the reconstruction of the sequence of
sharp images that generated the observed blurry image. To further refine
results, we optimize the trajectory post-inference via a reblur loss, improving
consistency between the blurry input and the restored output. Extensive
experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real datasets, particularly in cases with severe or spatially
variant blur, where end-to-end deblurring networks struggle.

Conclusion: SELM-SLAM3在挑战性条件下展现出增强的性能，为开发视觉障碍者导航辅助系统提供了可靠平台。

Abstract: Despite advancements in SLAM technologies, robust operation under challenging
conditions such as low-texture, motion-blur, or challenging lighting remains an
open challenge. Such conditions are common in applications such as assistive
navigation for the visually impaired. These challenges undermine localization
accuracy and tracking stability, reducing navigation reliability and safety. To
overcome these limitations, we present SELM-SLAM3, a deep learning-enhanced
visual SLAM framework that integrates SuperPoint and LightGlue for robust
feature extraction and matching. We evaluated our framework using TUM RGB-D,
ICL-NUIM, and TartanAir datasets, which feature diverse and challenging
scenarios. SELM-SLAM3 outperforms conventional ORB-SLAM3 by an average of
87.84% and exceeds state-of-the-art RGB-D SLAM systems by 36.77%. Our framework
demonstrates enhanced performance under challenging conditions, such as
low-texture scenes and fast motion, providing a reliable platform for
developing navigation aids for the visually impaired.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决消费级相机在复杂光照条件下（如低光、高动态范围、背光等）图像质量不稳定的问题，包括曝光不足、色偏和色调不一致，这些会降低下游视觉任务的性能。

Method: 提出ACamera-Net框架，包含两个模块：ACamera-Exposure估计ISO缓解曝光不足和对比度损失，ACamera-Color预测相关色温和增益因子改善色彩一致性。使用RAW输入，针对边缘设备优化实时推理。

Result: 在多样化真实世界数据上训练，模型在不同光照条件下泛化良好。大量实验表明ACamera-Net持续提升图像质量并稳定感知输出，优于传统自动模式和轻量级基线方法。

Conclusion: ACamera-Net无需额外图像增强模块，能够有效解决复杂光照条件下的相机参数调整问题，在边缘设备上实现实时高质量的图像处理。

Abstract: Consumer-grade camera systems often struggle to maintain stable image quality
under complex illumination conditions such as low light, high dynamic range,
and backlighting, as well as spatial color temperature variation. These issues
lead to underexposure, color casts, and tonal inconsistency, which degrade the
performance of downstream vision tasks. To address this, we propose
ACamera-Net, a lightweight and scene-adaptive camera parameter adjustment
network that directly predicts optimal exposure and white balance from RAW
inputs. The framework consists of two modules: ACamera-Exposure, which
estimates ISO to alleviate underexposure and contrast loss, and ACamera-Color,
which predicts correlated color temperature and gain factors for improved color
consistency. Optimized for real-time inference on edge devices, ACamera-Net can
be seamlessly integrated into imaging pipelines. Trained on diverse real-world
data with annotated references, the model generalizes well across lighting
conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACamera-Net consistently
enhances image quality and stabilizes perception outputs, outperforming
conventional auto modes and lightweight baselines without relying on additional
image enhancement modules.

Abstract: The realization of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates
Embodied AI agents capable of robust spatial perception, effective task
planning, and adaptive execution in physical environments. However, current
large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for embodied tasks
suffer from key limitations, including a significant gap between model design
and agent requirements, an unavoidable trade-off between real-time latency and
performance, and the use of unauthentic, offline evaluation metrics. To address
these challenges, we propose EmbodiedBrain, a novel vision-language foundation
model available in both 7B and 32B parameter sizes. Our framework features an
agent-aligned data structure and employs a powerful training methodology that
integrates large-scale Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Step-Augumented Group
Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), which boosts long-horizon task
success by integrating preceding steps as Guided Precursors. Furthermore, we
incorporate a comprehensive reward system, including a Generative Reward Model
(GRM) accelerated at the infrastructure level, to improve training efficiency.
For enable thorough validation, we establish a three-part evaluation system
encompassing General, Planning, and End-to-End Simulation Benchmarks,
highlighted by the proposal and open-sourcing of a novel, challenging
simulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate that EmbodiedBrain
achieves superior performance across all metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for embodied foundation models. Towards paving the way for the
next generation of generalist embodied agents, we open-source all of our data,
model weight, and evaluating methods, which are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Open-o3 Video是一个非代理框架，通过整合显式的时空证据来增强视频推理能力，在V-STAR基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数视频推理模型只生成文本推理轨迹，而不指示关键证据出现的时间和位置。将证据中心推理扩展到视频更具挑战性，需要跨动态场景的联合时间跟踪和空间定位。

Method: 构建两个高质量数据集STGR-CoT-30k和STGR-RL-36k，采用冷启动强化学习策略，设计多个专门奖励来共同鼓励答案准确性、时间对齐和空间精度。

Result: 在V-STAR基准测试中，mAM提高了14.4%，mLGM提高了24.2%。在VideoMME、WorldSense、VideoMMMU和TVGBench等广泛视频理解基准测试中也观察到一致改进。

Conclusion: Open-o3 Video不仅提高了准确性，其生成的推理轨迹还为测试时扩展提供了有价值信号，实现了置信度感知验证并提高了答案可靠性。

Abstract: Most video reasoning models only generate textual reasoning traces without
indicating when and where key evidence appears. Recent models such as OpenAI-o3
have sparked wide interest in evidence-centered reasoning for images, yet
extending this ability to videos is more challenging, as it requires joint
temporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes. We introduce
Open-o3 Video, a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal
evidence into video reasoning, and carefully collect training data and design
training strategies to address the aforementioned challenges. The model
highlights key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside its answers,
allowing reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations. To enable
this functionality, we first curate and build two high-quality datasets,
STGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL, with carefully constructed
temporal and spatial annotations, since most existing datasets offer either
temporal spans for videos or spatial boxes on images, lacking unified
spatio-temporal supervision and reasoning traces. Then, we adopt a cold-start
reinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that
jointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision.
On V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance,
raising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on the Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent
improvements are also observed on a broad range of video understanding
benchmarks, including VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench. Beyond
accuracy, the reasoning traces produced by Open-o3 Video also provide valuable
signals for test-time scaling, enabling confidence-aware verification and
improving answer reliability.

TL;DR: 提出了GenColorBench，这是第一个全面的文本到图像颜色生成基准，基于ISCC-NBS和CSS3/X11颜色系统，包含44K个颜色相关提示，覆盖400多种颜色，用于评估模型在细粒度颜色控制方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成模型在细粒度颜色可控性方面表现不佳，无法准确匹配文本提示中指定的颜色。现有基准要么忽视颜色评估，要么依赖粗略评估，缺乏对RGB值解释和人类期望对齐等关键能力的系统评估。

Method: 基于ISCC-NBS和CSS3/X11颜色系统构建基准，包含44,000个颜色聚焦提示，覆盖400多种颜色。通过感知评估和自动评估相结合的方式揭示模型的真实能力。

Result: 对流行文本到图像模型的评估显示性能存在差异，揭示了模型对不同颜色约定的理解程度，并识别了失败模式。

Conclusion: GenColorBench评估将指导精确颜色生成的改进，该基准将在接受后公开。

Abstract: Recent years have seen impressive advances in text-to-image generation, with
image generative or unified models producing high-quality images from text. Yet
these models still struggle with fine-grained color controllability, often
failing to accurately match colors specified in text prompts. While existing
benchmarks evaluate compositional reasoning and prompt adherence, none
systematically assess color precision. Color is fundamental to human visual
perception and communication, critical for applications from art to design
workflows requiring brand consistency. However, current benchmarks either
neglect color or rely on coarse assessments, missing key capabilities such as
interpreting RGB values or aligning with human expectations. To this end, we
propose GenColorBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for text-to-image
color generation, grounded in color systems like ISCC-NBS and CSS3/X11,
including numerical colors which are absent elsewhere. With 44K color-focused
prompts covering 400+ colors, it reveals models' true capabilities via
perceptual and automated assessments. Evaluations of popular text-to-image
models using GenColorBench show performance variations, highlighting which
color conventions models understand best and identifying failure modes. Our
GenColorBench assessments will guide improvements in precise color generation.
The benchmark will be made public upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在领域转移时性能急剧下降，无监督领域适应旨在减少领域差距并避免新领域的高昂标注成本。

Method: 在嵌入空间中学习类别原型，引入相似性约束使原型具有代表性且类别间可分离；使用字典存储不同图像的原型，防止类别缺失问题并实现原型对比学习。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法比其他最先进方法取得了更好的结果。

Conclusion: 基于相似性原型的跨模态分割框架能有效减少领域差距，提升模型在未见数据上的性能。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved great success on various vision
challenges, but a well-trained model would face drastic performance degradation
when applied to unseen data. Since the model is sensitive to domain shift,
unsupervised domain adaptation attempts to reduce the domain gap and avoid
costly annotation of unseen domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for
cross-modality segmentation via similarity-based prototypes. In specific, we
learn class-wise prototypes within an embedding space, then introduce a
similarity constraint to make these prototypes representative for each semantic
class while separable from different classes. Moreover, we use dictionaries to
store prototypes extracted from different images, which prevents the
class-missing problem and enables the contrastive learning of prototypes, and
further improves performance. Extensive experiments show that our method
achieves better results than other state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从单目视频重建自由移动物体的挑战，特别是在没有可靠姿态或深度线索以及任意物体运动的情况下。

Method: 使用双键内存模块结合潜在外观-几何键和显式方向键，通过空间引导的内存读取和高效稀疏化机制，将当前帧特征与时间聚合的物体状态稳健融合。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效处理自由移动物体的重建，提供全面而紧凑的物体覆盖，在计算效率和重建质量方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Free-moving object reconstruction from monocular video remains challenging,
particularly without reliable pose or depth cues and under arbitrary object
motion. We introduce OnlineSplatter, a novel online feed-forward framework
generating high-quality, object-centric 3D Gaussians directly from RGB frames
without requiring camera pose, depth priors, or bundle optimization. Our
approach anchors reconstruction using the first frame and progressively refines
the object representation through a dense Gaussian primitive field, maintaining
constant computational cost regardless of video sequence length. Our core
contribution is a dual-key memory module combining latent appearance-geometry
keys with explicit directional keys, robustly fusing current frame features
with temporally aggregated object states. This design enables effective
handling of free-moving objects via spatial-guided memory readout and an
efficient sparsification mechanism, ensuring comprehensive yet compact object
coverage. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that OnlineSplatter
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pose-free reconstruction baselines,
consistently improving with more observations while maintaining constant memory
and runtime.

Motivation: 长视频内容复杂多样且时间分散，现有视频大语言模型处理长序列计算成本高且推理不聚焦、不一致。现有帧选择方法忽略时间依赖或依赖单模态证据，无法提供完整且与查询相关的上下文

Method: 训练无关且模型无关的框架，包含两个关键组件：语义-视觉共识帧选择模块（结合时间感知语义分支和聚类引导视觉分支）和答案共识精炼模块（融合证据并约束答案空间）

Result: 在长视频理解基准测试中，SeViCES在准确性和鲁棒性方面持续优于最先进方法

Conclusion: 共识驱动的证据选择对视频大语言模型至关重要，SeViCES框架有效提升了长视频理解的性能

Abstract: Long video understanding remains challenging due to its complex, diverse, and
temporally scattered content. Although video large language models (Video-LLMs)
can process videos lasting tens of minutes, applying them to truly long
sequences is computationally prohibitive and often leads to unfocused or
inconsistent reasoning. A promising solution is to select only the most
informative frames, yet existing approaches typically ignore temporal
dependencies or rely on unimodal evidence, limiting their ability to provide
complete and query-relevant context. We propose a Semantic-Visual Consensus
Evidence Selection (SeViCES) framework for effective and reliable long video
understanding. SeViCES is training-free and model-agnostic, and introduces two
key components. The Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS) module
selects frames through (1) a temporal-aware semantic branch that leverages LLM
reasoning over captions, and (2) a cluster-guided visual branch that aligns
embeddings with semantic scores via mutual information. The Answer Consensus
Refinement (ACR) module further resolves inconsistencies between semantic- and
visual-based predictions by fusing evidence and constraining the answer space.
Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that SeViCES
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and
robustness, demonstrating the importance of consensus-driven evidence selection
for Video-LLMs.

Abstract: Efficient analysis and processing of dental images are crucial for dentists
to achieve accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. However, dental
imaging inherently poses several challenges, such as low contrast, metallic
artifacts, and variations in projection angles. Combined with the subjectivity
arising from differences in clinicians' expertise, manual interpretation often
proves time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Artificial intelligence
(AI)-based automated dental image analysis (DIA) offers a promising solution to
these issues and has become an integral part of computer-aided dental diagnosis
and treatment. Among various AI technologies, deep learning (DL) stands out as
the most widely applied and influential approach due to its superior feature
extraction and representation capabilities. To comprehensively summarize recent
progress in this field, we focus on the two fundamental aspects of DL
research-datasets and models. In this paper, we systematically review 260
studies on DL applications in DIA, including 49 papers on publicly available
dental datasets and 211 papers on DL-based algorithms. We first introduce the
basic concepts of dental imaging and summarize the characteristics and
acquisition methods of existing datasets. Then, we present the foundational
techniques of DL and categorize relevant models and algorithms according to
different DIA tasks, analyzing their network architectures, optimization
strategies, training methods, and performance. Furthermore, we summarize
commonly used training and evaluation metrics in the DIA domain. Finally, we
discuss the current challenges of existing research and outline potential
future directions. We hope that this work provides a valuable and systematic
reference for researchers in this field. All supplementary materials and
detailed comparison tables will be made publicly available on GitHub.

Motivation: 当前方法在处理高分辨率、长序列的3D医学影像时存在困难：对比预训练产生的视觉编码器与临床语言不匹配，切片级标记化模糊了精细解剖结构，降低了下游任务的诊断性能。

Method: 采用因果卷积编码器-解码器架构，统一2D和3D训练与推理，生成紧凑的频率感知体素标记。通过三阶段训练课程：局部重建、重叠窗口平铺和长上下文解码器精炼。

Result: 在报告生成任务中，BLEU分数提升，临床F1分数比CT2Rep、CT-CHAT和Merlin提高40%；在文本到CT合成中，FID降低75%，FVD减半，生成解剖学一致的512*512*241体积。

Conclusion: 精确的三维标记化对于3D医学影像中可扩展的视觉语言建模至关重要，而非仅仅依赖更大的语言骨干网络。

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language modeling for 3D medical imaging has been
fueled by large-scale computed tomography (CT) corpora with paired free-text
reports, stronger architectures, and powerful pretrained models. This has
enabled applications such as automated report generation and text-conditioned
3D image synthesis. Yet, current approaches struggle with high-resolution,
long-sequence volumes: contrastive pretraining often yields vision encoders
that are misaligned with clinical language, and slice-wise tokenization blurs
fine anatomy, reducing diagnostic performance on downstream tasks. We introduce
BTB3D (Better Tokens for Better 3D), a causal convolutional encoder-decoder
that unifies 2D and 3D training and inference while producing compact,
frequency-aware volumetric tokens. A three-stage training curriculum enables
(i) local reconstruction, (ii) overlapping-window tiling, and (iii)
long-context decoder refinement, during which the model learns from short slice
excerpts yet generalizes to scans exceeding 300 slices without additional
memory overhead. BTB3D sets a new state-of-the-art on two key tasks: it
improves BLEU scores and increases clinical F1 by 40% over CT2Rep, CT-CHAT, and
Merlin for report generation; and it reduces FID by 75% and halves FVD compared
to GenerateCT and MedSyn for text-to-CT synthesis, producing anatomically
consistent 512*512*241 volumes. These results confirm that precise
three-dimensional tokenization, rather than larger language backbones alone, is
essential for scalable vision-language modeling in 3D medical imaging. The

TL;DR: 提出了UltraHR-100K超高清文本到图像数据集和频率感知后训练方法，显著提升了超高清图像生成的细节质量和保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超高清文本到图像生成的两个关键挑战：缺乏大规模高质量超高清数据集，以及忽视针对超高清场景的细粒度细节合成训练策略。

Method: 1) 构建包含10万张3K+分辨率图像的UltraHR-100K数据集；2) 提出频率感知后训练方法，包括细节导向时间步采样(DOTS)和软加权频率正则化(SWFR)。

Result: 在UltraHR-eval4K基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著提高了超高清图像生成的细粒度细节质量和整体保真度。

Conclusion: 所提出的数据集和训练方法有效解决了超高清文本到图像生成的关键挑战，为高质量超高清图像生成提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) text-to-image (T2I) generation has seen notable
progress. However, two key challenges remain : 1) the absence of a large-scale
high-quality UHR T2I dataset, and (2) the neglect of tailored training
strategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios. To tackle the
first challenge, we introduce \textbf{UltraHR-100K}, a high-quality dataset of
100K UHR images with rich captions, offering diverse content and strong visual
fidelity. Each image exceeds 3K resolution and is rigorously curated based on
detail richness, content complexity, and aesthetic quality. To tackle the
second challenge, we propose a frequency-aware post-training method that
enhances fine-detail generation in T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we
design (i) \textit{Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS)} to focus learning
on detail-critical denoising steps, and (ii) \textit{Soft-Weighting Frequency
Regularization (SWFR)}, which leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to
softly constrain frequency components, encouraging high-frequency detail
preservation. Extensive experiments on our proposed UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the fine-grained detail
quality and overall fidelity of UHR image generation. The code is available at

Abstract: Accurate waste classification is vital for achieving sustainable waste
management and reducing the environmental footprint of urbanization.
Misclassification of recyclable materials contributes to landfill accumulation,
inefficient recycling, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. To address these
issues, this study introduces HybridSOMSpikeNet, a hybrid deep learning
framework that integrates convolutional feature extraction, differentiable
self-organization, and spiking-inspired temporal processing to enable
intelligent and energy-efficient waste classification. The proposed model
employs a pre-trained ResNet-152 backbone to extract deep spatial
representations, followed by a Differentiable Soft Self-Organizing Map
(Soft-SOM) that enhances topological clustering and interpretability. A spiking
neural head accumulates temporal activations over discrete time steps,
improving robustness and generalization. Trained on a ten-class waste dataset,
HybridSOMSpikeNet achieved a test accuracy of 97.39%, outperforming several
state-of-the-art architectures while maintaining a lightweight computational
profile suitable for real-world deployment. Beyond its technical innovations,
the framework provides tangible environmental benefits. By enabling precise and
automated waste segregation, it supports higher recycling efficiency, reduces
contamination in recyclable streams, and minimizes the ecological and
operational costs of waste processing. The approach aligns with global
sustainability priorities, particularly the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals (SDG 11 and SDG 12), by contributing to cleaner cities,
circular economy initiatives, and intelligent environmental management systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出两种技术来减少多比特量化网络的训练开销：权重偏置校正和比特级核心集采样，在保持模型性能的同时将训练时间减少高达7.88倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多比特量化网络方法需要为每个支持的比特宽度重复完整数据集更新，导致训练开销随精度数量线性增长，且通常需要额外的微调阶段来支持更多精度选项

Method: 1. 权重偏置校正：通过中和跨比特宽度的量化诱导偏置和对齐激活分布，实现共享批归一化，无需微调；2. 比特级核心集采样：利用隐式知识转移现象，通过基于梯度的重要性评分选择紧凑信息子集进行训练

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100、TinyImageNet和ImageNet-1K数据集上，使用ResNet和ViT架构的实验表明，该方法在实现竞争性或更优准确率的同时，将训练时间减少高达7.88倍

Conclusion: 所提出的方法显著降低了多比特量化网络的训练开销，同时保持了模型性能，为灵活部署深度学习模型提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Multi-bit quantization networks enable flexible deployment of deep neural
networks by supporting multiple precision levels within a single model.
However, existing approaches suffer from significant training overhead as
full-dataset updates are repeated for each supported bit-width, resulting in a
cost that scales linearly with the number of precisions. Additionally, extra
fine-tuning stages are often required to support additional or intermediate
precision options, further compounding the overall training burden. To address
this issue, we propose two techniques that greatly reduce the training overhead
without compromising model utility: (i) Weight bias correction enables shared
batch normalization and eliminates the need for fine-tuning by neutralizing
quantization-induced bias across bit-widths and aligning activation
distributions; and (ii) Bit-wise coreset sampling strategy allows each child
model to train on a compact, informative subset selected via gradient-based
importance scores by exploiting the implicit knowledge transfer phenomenon.
Experiments on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K with both ResNet and
ViT architectures demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior
accuracy while reducing training time up to 7.88x. Our code is released at

Conclusion: 未来视觉推理模型应专注于整合更广泛的专业化视觉分析工具，作者将发布框架和评估套件以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that integrate visual and textual
reasoning leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to tackle complex visual
tasks, yet continue to exhibit visual hallucinations and an over-reliance on
textual priors. We present a systematic diagnosis of state-of-the-art
vision-language models using a three-stage evaluation framework, uncovering key
failure modes. To address these, we propose an agent-based architecture that
combines LLM reasoning with lightweight visual modules, enabling fine-grained
analysis and iterative refinement of reasoning chains. Our results highlight
future visual reasoning models should focus on integrating a broader set of
specialized tools for analyzing visual content. Our system achieves significant
gains (+10.3 on MMMU, +6.0 on MathVista over a 7B baseline), matching or
surpassing much larger models. We will release our framework and evaluation

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MixKV是一种新颖的KV缓存压缩方法，通过结合重要性和多样性来优化大型视觉语言模型中的KV缓存压缩，在极端压缩条件下显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法主要关注保留高重要性KV对以最小化存储，但忽视了多模态KV缓存中出现的模态特定语义冗余模式，这限制了部署的可扩展性。

Method: MixKV方法分析KV缓存在不同注意力头中的冗余程度，自适应地平衡多样性和重要性来压缩KV对，而不是仅仅依赖重要性。

Result: 在极端压缩（预算=64）条件下，MixKV将基线方法在五个多模态理解基准上平均提升5.1%，在GUI接地任务上对SnapKV和AdaKV分别实现8.0%和9.0%的显著增益，同时保持相当的推理效率。

Conclusion: MixKV通过结合重要性和多样性来优化KV缓存压缩，在LVLMs中一致增强现有方法，并可无缝扩展到LLMs，具有可观的性能提升。

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in processing extended multi-modal sequences, yet the resulting
key-value (KV) cache expansion creates a critical memory bottleneck that
fundamentally limits deployment scalability. While existing KV cache
compression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize
storage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns
that emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first
analyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying
levels of redundancy across attention heads. We show that relying solely on
importance can only cover a subset of the full KV cache information
distribution, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage. To address this,
we propose \texttt{MixKV}, a novel method that mixes importance with diversity
for optimized KV cache compression in LVLMs. \texttt{MixKV} adapts to head-wise
semantic redundancy, selectively balancing diversity and importance when
compressing KV pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{MixKV}
consistently enhances existing methods across multiple LVLMs. Under extreme
compression (budget=64), \texttt{MixKV} improves baseline methods by an average
of \textbf{5.1\%} across five multi-modal understanding benchmarks and achieves
remarkable gains of \textbf{8.0\%} and \textbf{9.0\%} for SnapKV and AdaKV on
GUI grounding tasks, all while maintaining comparable inference efficiency.
Furthermore, \texttt{MixKV} extends seamlessly to LLMs with comparable
performance gains. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ALICE-LRI是一种传感器无关的方法，能够从旋转LiDAR点云生成无损距离图像，无需制造商元数据或校准文件，实现零点损失和完全点云重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LiDAR投影方法存在几何不一致性，导致不可逆的信息损失，影响高保真应用。需要一种能够实现无损投影的方法来支持高精度遥感应用。

Method: 通过自动逆向工程推断LiDAR传感器的内在几何参数，包括激光束配置、角度分布和每束激光的校准校正，实现无损投影和完整点云重建。

Result: 在KITTI和DurLAR数据集上的全面评估显示，ALICE-LRI实现了完美的点保留，所有点云中零点损失，几何精度保持在传感器精度限制内，具有实时性能。

Conclusion: 从近似到无损LiDAR投影的范式转变，为需要完全几何保留的高精度遥感应用开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: 3D LiDAR sensors are essential for autonomous navigation, environmental
monitoring, and precision mapping in remote sensing applications. To
efficiently process the massive point clouds generated by these sensors, LiDAR
data is often projected into 2D range images that organize points by their
angular positions and distances. While these range image representations enable
efficient processing, conventional projection methods suffer from fundamental
geometric inconsistencies that cause irreversible information loss,
compromising high-fidelity applications. We present ALICE-LRI (Automatic LiDAR
Intrinsic Calibration Estimation for Lossless Range Images), the first general,
sensor-agnostic method that achieves lossless range image generation from
spinning LiDAR point clouds without requiring manufacturer metadata or
calibration files. Our algorithm automatically reverse-engineers the intrinsic
geometry of any spinning LiDAR sensor by inferring critical parameters
including laser beam configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam
calibration corrections, enabling lossless projection and complete point cloud
reconstruction with zero point loss. Comprehensive evaluation across the
complete KITTI and DurLAR datasets demonstrates that ALICE-LRI achieves perfect
point preservation, with zero points lost across all point clouds. Geometric
accuracy is maintained well within sensor precision limits, establishing
geometric losslessness with real-time performance. We also present a
compression case study that validates substantial downstream benefits,
demonstrating significant quality improvements in practical applications. This
paradigm shift from approximate to lossless LiDAR projections opens new
possibilities for high-precision remote sensing applications requiring complete
geometric preservation.

Conclusion: AutoScape通过几何一致的关键帧生成和插值方法，有效解决了长时域驾驶场景生成的几何一致性问题，显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: This paper proposes AutoScape, a long-horizon driving scene generation
framework. At its core is a novel RGB-D diffusion model that iteratively
generates sparse, geometrically consistent keyframes, serving as reliable
anchors for the scene's appearance and geometry. To maintain long-range
geometric consistency, the model 1) jointly handles image and depth in a shared
latent space, 2) explicitly conditions on the existing scene geometry (i.e.,
rendered point clouds) from previously generated keyframes, and 3) steers the
sampling process with a warp-consistent guidance. Given high-quality RGB-D
keyframes, a video diffusion model then interpolates between them to produce
dense and coherent video frames. AutoScape generates realistic and
geometrically consistent driving videos of over 20 seconds, improving the
long-horizon FID and FVD scores over the prior state-of-the-art by 48.6\% and
43.0\%, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Dynamic Position Extrapolation (DyPE)，一种无需训练的方法，使预训练扩散变换器能够生成远超训练分辨率的高质量图像，且不增加采样成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器模型在高分辨率下训练成本极高，因为自注意力机制随图像token数量呈二次方增长。需要一种方法能在不重新训练的情况下扩展模型到更高分辨率。

Method: 利用扩散过程的光谱特性，在每一步扩散过程中动态调整位置编码，使其频率谱与当前生成阶段匹配。低频结构早期收敛，高频细节需要更多步骤来解析。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，DyPE持续提升性能，在超高分辨率图像生成中达到最先进的保真度，例如使用FLUX生成1600万像素图像。分辨率越高，性能提升越明显。

Conclusion: DyPE是一种高效且无需训练的方法，能够显著扩展预训练扩散变换器的分辨率能力，在超高分辨率图像生成中表现出色。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer models can generate images with remarkable fidelity and
detail, yet training them at ultra-high resolutions remains extremely costly
due to the self-attention mechanism's quadratic scaling with the number of
image tokens. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Position Extrapolation
(DyPE), a novel, training-free method that enables pre-trained diffusion
transformers to synthesize images at resolutions far beyond their training
data, with no additional sampling cost. DyPE takes advantage of the spectral
progression inherent to the diffusion process, where low-frequency structures
converge early, while high-frequencies take more steps to resolve.
Specifically, DyPE dynamically adjusts the model's positional encoding at each
diffusion step, matching their frequency spectrum with the current stage of the
generative process. This approach allows us to generate images at resolutions
that exceed the training resolution dramatically, e.g., 16 million pixels using
FLUX. On multiple benchmarks, DyPE consistently improves performance and
achieves state-of-the-art fidelity in ultra-high-resolution image generation,
with gains becoming even more pronounced at higher resolutions. Project page is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现MeanFlow目标自然分解为轨迹流匹配和轨迹一致性两个部分，这两个术语存在强负相关性，导致优化冲突和收敛缓慢。

Method: 提出了α-Flow目标家族，统一了轨迹流匹配、Shortcut Model和MeanFlow，采用课程学习策略平滑地从轨迹流匹配过渡到MeanFlow。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K 256x256上，α-Flow始终优于MeanFlow，最大的α-Flow-XL/2+模型使用vanilla DiT骨干网络实现了FID 2.58（1-NFE）和2.15（2-NFE）的新SOTA结果。

Conclusion: α-Flow通过解耦冲突目标并采用课程学习策略，有效解决了MeanFlow的优化问题，在少步生成建模中取得了显著改进。

Abstract: MeanFlow has recently emerged as a powerful framework for few-step generative
modeling trained from scratch, but its success is not yet fully understood. In
this work, we show that the MeanFlow objective naturally decomposes into two
parts: trajectory flow matching and trajectory consistency. Through gradient
analysis, we find that these terms are strongly negatively correlated, causing
optimization conflict and slow convergence. Motivated by these insights, we
introduce $\alpha$-Flow, a broad family of objectives that unifies trajectory
flow matching, Shortcut Model, and MeanFlow under one formulation. By adopting
a curriculum strategy that smoothly anneals from trajectory flow matching to
MeanFlow, $\alpha$-Flow disentangles the conflicting objectives, and achieves
better convergence. When trained from scratch on class-conditional ImageNet-1K
256x256 with vanilla DiT backbones, $\alpha$-Flow consistently outperforms
MeanFlow across scales and settings. Our largest $\alpha$-Flow-XL/2+ model
achieves new state-of-the-art results using vanilla DiT backbones, with FID
scores of 2.58 (1-NFE) and 2.15 (2-NFE).

Motivation: 解决从单张2D图像进行3D重建的挑战，包括相机姿态估计、3D形状重建和纹理恢复，实现更准确的姿态和形状估计。

Method: 采用两阶段流匹配管道：粗阶段生成初始3D几何和2D投影用于姿态恢复；精炼阶段整合姿态对齐的图像特征以增强结构保真度和外观细节。

Result: 在广泛实验中，Cupid优于领先的3D重建方法，PSNR增益超过3dB，Chamfer距离减少超过10%，在姿态精度上匹配单目估计器，视觉保真度优于基线3D生成模型。

Conclusion: Cupid通过将3D重建建模为条件采样过程，在统一生成框架下实现了准确的相机姿态、3D形状和纹理推断，为单图像3D重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This work proposes a new generation-based 3D reconstruction method, named
Cupid, that accurately infers the camera pose, 3D shape, and texture of an
object from a single 2D image. Cupid casts 3D reconstruction as a conditional
sampling process from a learned distribution of 3D objects, and it jointly
generates voxels and pixel-voxel correspondences, enabling robust pose and
shape estimation under a unified generative framework. By representing both
input camera poses and 3D shape as a distribution in a shared 3D latent space,
Cupid adopts a two-stage flow matching pipeline: (1) a coarse stage that
produces initial 3D geometry with associated 2D projections for pose recovery;
and (2) a refinement stage that integrates pose-aligned image features to
enhance structural fidelity and appearance details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate Cupid outperforms leading 3D reconstruction methods with an over 3
dB PSNR gain and an over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, while matching
monocular estimators on pose accuracy and delivering superior visual fidelity
over baseline 3D generative models. For an immersive view of the 3D results

Motivation: 现有研究往往低估雷达的作用，将其置于辅助地位，而雷达能够提供目标在世界3D坐标系中的精确距离/深度信息

Method: 开发雷达-相机融合MOT框架，利用在线雷达-相机校准简化传感器检测结果集成；利用雷达和相机数据的共同特征准确推导检测对象的真实世界位置；采用特征匹配和类别一致性检查超越单纯位置匹配的限制

Conclusion: 这是首个研究雷达-相机共同特征集成及其在在线校准中用于实现MOT的工作，代码已开源

Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) framework that fuses radar
and camera data to enhance tracking efficiency while minimizing manual
interventions. Contrary to many studies that underutilize radar and assign it a
supplementary role--despite its capability to provide accurate range/depth
information of targets in a world 3D coordinate system--our approach positions
radar in a crucial role. Meanwhile, this paper utilizes common features to
enable online calibration to autonomously associate detections from radar and
camera. The main contributions of this work include: (1) the development of a
radar-camera fusion MOT framework that exploits online radar-camera calibration
to simplify the integration of detection results from these two sensors, (2)
the utilization of common features between radar and camera data to accurately
derive real-world positions of detected objects, and (3) the adoption of
feature matching and category-consistency checking to surpass the limitations
of mere position matching in enhancing sensor association accuracy. To the best
of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the integration of
radar-camera common features and their use in online calibration for achieving
MOT. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by its ability to streamline
the radar-camera mapping process and improve tracking precision, as evidenced
by real-world experiments conducted in both controlled environments and actual
traffic scenarios. Code is available at

TL;DR: ARGenSeg是一个基于自回归生成的新型图像分割范式，通过图像生成方式在统一框架内实现多模态理解和像素级感知，显著提升推理速度并保持强大理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法使用边界点表示或专用分割头时，依赖离散表示或语义提示输入任务特定解码器，限制了多模态大语言模型捕捉细粒度视觉细节的能力。

Method: 基于图像生成的分割框架，利用MLLM输出视觉标记，通过通用VQ-VAE解码为图像，采用下一尺度预测策略并行生成所需视觉标记以减少推理延迟。

Result: 在多个分割数据集上超越先前最先进方法，推理速度显著提升，同时保持强大的理解能力。

Conclusion: ARGenSeg通过生成式方法成功统一了多模态理解和像素级感知，为图像分割提供了高效且强大的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel AutoRegressive Generation-based paradigm for image
Segmentation (ARGenSeg), achieving multimodal understanding and pixel-level
perception within a unified framework. Prior works integrating image
segmentation into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically employ
either boundary points representation or dedicated segmentation heads. These
methods rely on discrete representations or semantic prompts fed into
task-specific decoders, which limits the ability of the MLLM to capture
fine-grained visual details. To address these challenges, we introduce a
segmentation framework for MLLM based on image generation, which naturally
produces dense masks for target objects. We leverage MLLM to output visual
tokens and detokenize them into images using an universal VQ-VAE, making the
segmentation fully dependent on the pixel-level understanding of the MLLM. To
reduce inference latency, we employ a next-scale-prediction strategy to
generate required visual tokens in parallel. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple
segmentation datasets with a remarkable boost in inference speed, while
maintaining strong understanding capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Speculative Verdict (SV)框架，通过结合多个轻量级草稿专家和一个大型裁决模型，在信息密集型图像上实现高效的多跳推理，无需训练即可提升视觉问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在处理信息密集型图像时面临挑战，这些图像密集交织文本注释和细粒度图形元素，需要精确定位关键线索和整合分散证据的多跳推理。

Method: 采用类似推测解码的方法：草稿阶段由小型VLM作为草稿专家生成多样化的定位候选推理路径；裁决阶段由强大VLM综合这些路径生成最终答案。引入共识专家选择机制，仅转发高一致性推理路径给裁决模型。

Result: 在InfographicVQA、ChartMuseum、ChartQAPro和HR-Bench 4K等具有挑战性的信息密集和高分辨率视觉问答基准上取得一致性能提升。

Conclusion: SV通过综合多个部分准确推理路径中的正确见解，相比大型专有模型或训练流程，实现了错误校正和成本效率的双重优势。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over
information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with
fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely
localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate
dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free
framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight
draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as
draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization
candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to
produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering
correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a
consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement
reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on
challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering
benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K.
By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning
paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large
proprietary models or training pipelines. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于纯Transformer的自回归视频预测模型，在物理模拟数据集上实现更长时间范围的准确预测，比现有方法延长50%预测时间，同时保持参数效率和可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受自回归大语言模型启发，将Transformer应用于视频预测领域，专注于解决现有视频生成方法在物理模拟时间因果建模方面的不足

Method: 使用纯Transformer架构进行自回归视频预测，采用连续像素空间表示，比较不同时空自注意力布局，无需复杂训练策略或潜在特征学习组件

Result: 在物理模拟数据集上，相比现有潜在空间方法，物理准确预测的时间范围显著延长50%，在常见视频质量指标上保持可比性能

Conclusion: 该方法为基于注意力的时空视频建模提供了一个简单、参数高效且可解释的平台，通过探测模型发现网络能够泛化到分布外模拟参数的估计

Abstract: Inspired by the performance and scalability of autoregressive large language
models (LLMs), transformer-based models have seen recent success in the visual
domain. This study investigates a transformer adaptation for video prediction
with a simple end-to-end approach, comparing various spatiotemporal
self-attention layouts. Focusing on causal modeling of physical simulations
over time; a common shortcoming of existing video-generative approaches, we
attempt to isolate spatiotemporal reasoning via physical object tracking
metrics and unsupervised training on physical simulation datasets. We introduce
a simple yet effective pure transformer model for autoregressive video
prediction, utilizing continuous pixel-space representations for video
prediction. Without the need for complex training strategies or latent
feature-learning components, our approach significantly extends the time
horizon for physically accurate predictions by up to 50% when compared with
existing latent-space approaches, while maintaining comparable performance on
common video quality metrics. In addition, we conduct interpretability
experiments to identify network regions that encode information useful to
perform accurate estimations of PDE simulation parameters via probing models,
and find that this generalizes to the estimation of out-of-distribution
simulation parameters. This work serves as a platform for further
attention-based spatiotemporal modeling of videos via a simple, parameter
efficient, and interpretable approach.

*Ritik Shah,Marco F Duarte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpectraMorph是一个基于物理指导的自监督高光谱-多光谱图像融合框架，通过解混瓶颈实现可解释的高光谱超分辨率，在单波段多光谱图像下仍保持鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法缺乏可解释性，且在少波段多光谱图像下性能下降。需要一种既保持性能又提供可解释性的融合方法。

Method: 采用解混瓶颈结构：从低分辨率高光谱图像提取端元特征，用多层感知机从多光谱图像预测丰度图，通过线性混合重建光谱，使用多光谱传感器的光谱响应函数进行自监督训练。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，SpectraMorph始终优于最先进的无监督/自监督基线方法，与监督基线方法相比也很有竞争力，训练时间不到1分钟。

Conclusion: SpectraMorph通过物理指导的解混方法实现了可解释的高光谱超分辨率，在少波段情况下仍保持鲁棒性，为高光谱图像融合提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral sensors capture dense spectra per pixel but suffer from low
spatial resolution, causing blurred boundaries and mixed-pixel effects.
Co-registered companion sensors such as multispectral, RGB, or panchromatic
cameras provide high-resolution spatial detail, motivating hyperspectral
super-resolution through the fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral images
(HSI-MSI). Existing deep learning based methods achieve strong performance but
rely on opaque regressors that lack interpretability and often fail when the
MSI has very few bands. We propose SpectraMorph, a physics-guided
self-supervised fusion framework with a structured latent space. Instead of
direct regression, SpectraMorph enforces an unmixing bottleneck: endmember
signatures are extracted from the low-resolution HSI, and a compact multilayer
perceptron predicts abundance-like maps from the MSI. Spectra are reconstructed
by linear mixing, with training performed in a self-supervised manner via the
MSI sensor's spectral response function. SpectraMorph produces interpretable
intermediates, trains in under a minute, and remains robust even with a
single-band (pan-chromatic) MSI. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show SpectraMorph consistently outperforming state-of-the-art
unsupervised/self-supervised baselines while remaining very competitive against
supervised baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于潜在变量的扩散桥模型（LDDBM），用于跨模态转换任务，支持任意模态对之间的转换，无需对齐维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在单模态领域表现出色，但在跨模态转换方面仍面临挑战。现有方法存在维度共享、高斯先验和模态特定架构等限制，缺乏通用性和理论基础。

Method: 在共享潜在空间中学习模态间的桥接，使用对比对齐损失保证语义一致性，设计域无关的编码器-解码器架构进行潜在空间噪声预测，并提出预测损失指导训练。

Result: 在多种跨模态转换任务上表现优异，包括多视角到3D形状生成、图像超分辨率和多视角场景合成，建立了跨模态转换的新基准。

Conclusion: LDDBM提供了一个通用框架，能够有效处理任意模态对之间的转换，为跨模态转换任务提供了新的强基线方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have positioned diffusion models as
state-of-the-art tools for sampling from complex data distributions. While
these models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such
as images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translation (MT),
translating information across different sensory modalities, remains an open
challenge. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including
shared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific
architectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this
work, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a
general-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable
extension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent
space, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without
requiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to
enforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a
domain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in
latent space. Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training
toward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training
strategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs
and performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape
generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis.
Comprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerComposer是一个交互式多主体个性化文本到图像生成框架，通过分层画布和锁定机制实现空间组合控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化生成模型缺乏对空间组合的交互控制，且难以扩展到多个主体。

Method: 引入分层画布表示，每个主体放在独立层上实现无遮挡组合；提出锁定机制，保持选定层的高保真度，同时让其他层灵活适应上下文。

Result: 实验表明LayerComposer在多主体个性化图像生成中实现了优于现有方法的空间控制和身份保持。

Conclusion: 该框架通过直观的层操作提供专业图像编辑软件般的用户体验，无需架构修改即可实现多主体生成控制。

Abstract: Despite their impressive visual fidelity, existing personalized generative
models lack interactive control over spatial composition and scale poorly to
multiple subjects. To address these limitations, we present LayerComposer, an
interactive framework for personalized, multi-subject text-to-image generation.
Our approach introduces two main contributions: (1) a layered canvas, a novel
representation in which each subject is placed on a distinct layer, enabling
occlusion-free composition; and (2) a locking mechanism that preserves selected
layers with high fidelity while allowing the remaining layers to adapt flexibly
to the surrounding context. Similar to professional image-editing software, the
proposed layered canvas allows users to place, resize, or lock input subjects
through intuitive layer manipulation. Our versatile locking mechanism requires
no architectural changes, relying instead on inherent positional embeddings
combined with a new complementary data sampling strategy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that LayerComposer achieves superior spatial control and identity
preservation compared to the state-of-the-art methods in multi-subject
personalized image generation.

TL;DR: HoloCine是一个文本到视频生成模型，通过整体生成整个场景来解决现有模型在创建连贯多镜头叙事方面的不足，实现了端到端的电影制作能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本到视频模型在生成连贯多镜头叙事方面的"叙事鸿沟"，从孤立的片段生成转向整体场景生成。

Method: 采用窗口交叉注意力机制将文本提示定位到特定镜头，并使用稀疏镜头间自注意力模式（镜头内密集、镜头间稀疏）确保分钟级生成的效率。

Result: 在叙事连贯性方面达到新的最先进水平，并展现出对角色和场景的持久记忆以及对电影技术的直观理解等新兴能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作标志着从片段合成向自动化电影制作的关键转变，使端到端的电影创作成为可实现的未来。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-video models excel at generating isolated clips but
fall short of creating the coherent, multi-shot narratives, which are the
essence of storytelling. We bridge this "narrative gap" with HoloCine, a model
that generates entire scenes holistically to ensure global consistency from the
first shot to the last. Our architecture achieves precise directorial control
through a Window Cross-Attention mechanism that localizes text prompts to
specific shots, while a Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention pattern (dense within
shots but sparse between them) ensures the efficiency required for minute-scale
generation. Beyond setting a new state-of-the-art in narrative coherence,
HoloCine develops remarkable emergent abilities: a persistent memory for
characters and scenes, and an intuitive grasp of cinematic techniques. Our work
marks a pivotal shift from clip synthesis towards automated filmmaking, making
end-to-end cinematic creation a tangible future. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: DeBERTa-KC是一个基于Transformer的模型，用于自动分类在线科学学习讨论中的知识构建水平，在YouTube科学频道评论数据集上取得了0.836的宏F1分数，显著优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够自动分析非正式数字学习环境中知识构建水平的工具，以支持大规模的话语分析和认知参与评估。

Method: 扩展DeBERTa-v3模型，结合Focal Loss、标签平滑和R-Drop正则化技术来处理类别不平衡并增强泛化能力，构建了端到端的可复现流程。

Result: 在10折分层交叉验证中，DeBERTa-KC达到0.836±0.008的宏F1分数，显著优于传统和Transformer基线模型（p<0.01），对高阶认知参与（特别是Explore和Negotiate类别）表现出强敏感性。

Conclusion: 大语言模型能够有效捕捉非正式数字学习环境中知识构建的细微指标，为话语分析和认知参与评估工具的开发提供了可扩展的理论驱动方法。

Abstract: This study presents DeBERTa-KC, a transformer-based model for automatic
classification of knowledge construction (KC) levels in online science learning
discourse. Using comments collected from four popular YouTube science channels
(2022--2024), a balanced corpus of 20,000 manually annotated samples was
created across four KC categories: \textit{nonKC}, \textit{Share},
\textit{Explore}, and \textit{Negotiate}. The proposed model extends DeBERTa-v3
with Focal Loss, Label Smoothing, and R-Drop regularization to address class
imbalance and enhance generalization. A reproducible end-to-end pipeline was
implemented, encompassing data extraction, annotation, preprocessing, training,
and evaluation. Across 10-fold stratified cross-validation, DeBERTa-KC achieved
a macro-F1 of $0.836 \pm 0.008$, significantly out-performing both classical
and transformer baselines ($p<0.01$). Per-category results indicate strong
sensitivity to higher-order epistemic engagement, particularly in
\textit{Explore} and \textit{Negotiate} discourse. These findings demonstrate
that large language models can effectively capture nuanced indicators of
knowledge construction in informal digital learning environments, offering
scalable, theory-informed approaches to discourse analysis and the development
of automated tools for assessing epistemic engagement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估五个主流大语言模型生成高中物理课程计划的质量，发现模型选择影响可读性，提示框架结构影响事实准确性和教学完整性。最佳配置是结合可读性优化模型与RACE框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估AI生成课程计划的教学合理性和可用性，比较不同模型和提示框架对生成质量的影响。

Method: 使用五个大语言模型和三种提示框架生成15个高中物理课程计划，通过四个计算指标分析：可读性、事实准确性、课程标准对齐、认知需求。

Result: DeepSeek生成最易读的课程计划，Claude语言最密集；RACE框架产生最低的幻觉指数和最高的课程标准对齐；所有模型的学习目标都集中在布鲁姆分类法的低阶认知层次。

Conclusion: 可读性主要由模型设计决定，而教学可靠性和课程对齐更多依赖提示框架。最佳配置是结合可读性优化模型与RACE框架及明确的概念清单。

Abstract: This study evaluates the pedagogical soundness and usability of AI-generated
lesson plans across five leading large language models: ChatGPT (GPT-5), Claude
Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3.2, and Grok 4. Beyond model choice,
three structured prompt frameworks were tested: TAG (Task, Audience, Goal),
RACE (Role, Audience, Context, Execution), and COSTAR (Context, Objective,
Style, Tone, Audience, Response Format).
  Fifteen lesson plans were generated for a single high-school physics topic,
The Electromagnetic Spectrum. The lesson plans were analyzed through four
automated computational metrics: (1) readability and linguistic complexity, (2)
factual accuracy and hallucination detection, (3) standards and curriculum
alignment, and (4) cognitive demand of learning objectives.
  Results indicate that model selection exerted the strongest influence on
linguistic accessibility, with DeepSeek producing the most readable teaching
plan (FKGL = 8.64) and Claude generating the densest language (FKGL = 19.89).
  The prompt framework structure most strongly affected the factual accuracy
and pedagogical completeness, with the RACE framework yielding the lowest
hallucination index and the highest incidental alignment with NGSS curriculum
standards. Across all models, the learning objectives in the fifteen lesson
plans clustered at the Remember and Understand tiers of Bloom's taxonomy. There
were limited higher-order verbs in the learning objectives extracted.
  Overall, the findings suggest that readability is significantly governed by
model design, while instructional reliability and curricular alignment depend
more on the prompt framework. The most effective configuration for lesson plans
identified in the results was to combine a readability-optimized model with the
RACE framework and an explicit checklist of physics concepts, curriculum
standards, and higher-order objectives.

TL;DR: ReDiff是一个改进的离散扩散模型框架，通过主动修正而非被动去噪来打破错误级联，显著提升生成内容的连贯性和事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离散扩散模型存在训练-推理差异，导致并行解码时初始令牌错误污染生成上下文，引发级联错误、语法错误和语义幻觉。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：首先训练模型修正合成错误建立基础修正能力；然后通过在线自修正循环，让模型学习修正自己的错误草稿。

Result: 实验表明ReDiff显著提高了生成内容的连贯性和事实准确性，实现了比传统去噪方法更稳定高效的并行生成。

Conclusion: ReDiff通过主动修正机制成功解决了离散扩散模型的错误级联问题，为视觉语言任务提供了更可靠的生成框架。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a promising direction for
vision-language tasks, offering bidirectional context modeling and theoretical
parallelization. However, their practical application is severely hindered by a
train-inference discrepancy, which leads to catastrophic error cascades:
initial token errors during parallel decoding pollute the generation context,
triggering a chain reaction of compounding errors and leading to syntactic
errors and semantic hallucinations. To address this fundamental challenge, we
reframe the generation process from passive denoising to active refining. We
introduce ReDiff, a refining-enhanced diffusion framework that teaches the
model to identify and correct its own errors. Our approach features a two-stage
training process: first, we instill a foundational revision capability by
training the model to revise synthetic errors; second, we implement a novel
online self-correction loop where the model is explicitly trained to revise its
own flawed drafts by learning from an expert's corrections. This mistake-driven
learning endows the model with the crucial ability to revisit and refine its
already generated output, effectively breaking the error cascade. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ReDiff significantly improves the coherence and
factual accuracy of generated content, enabling stable and efficient parallel
generation far superior to traditional denoising methods. Our codes and models
are available at https://rediff-hku.github.io/.

TL;DR: 提出了Sparse Tracing技术，通过动态稀疏注意力高效分析长上下文注意力模式，解决了传统方法在百万token上下文下内存需求过高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型扩展到百万token上下文，传统注意力分析技术因二次方复杂度需要TB级内存，无法处理超过10万token的上下文。

Method: 提出了Stream算法，使用层次剪枝估计每个头的稀疏注意力掩码，在近线性时间和线性空间内实现可编译的一遍可解释性分析。

Result: 在长链式推理轨迹中识别思想锚点，剪枝97-99%的token交互；在RULER基准测试中保留关键检索路径，剪枝90-96%交互，暴露从针到输出的层间路径。

Conclusion: Sparse Tracing为分析注意力模式和追踪信息流提供了实用的即插即用工具，使长上下文可解释性在消费级GPU上可行，有助于民主化链式思维监控。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to million-token contexts, traditional
Mechanistic Interpretability techniques for analyzing attention scale
quadratically with context length, demanding terabytes of memory beyond 100,000
tokens. We introduce Sparse Tracing, a novel technique that leverages dynamic
sparse attention to efficiently analyze long context attention patterns. We
present Stream, a compilable hierarchical pruning algorithm that estimates
per-head sparse attention masks in near-linear time $O(T \log T)$ and linear
space $O(T)$, enabling one-pass interpretability at scale. Stream performs a
binary-search-style refinement to retain only the top-$k$ key blocks per query
while preserving the model's next-token behavior. We apply Stream to long
chain-of-thought reasoning traces and identify thought anchors while pruning
97-99\% of token interactions. On the RULER benchmark, Stream preserves
critical retrieval paths while discarding 90-96\% of interactions and exposes
layer-wise routes from the needle to output. Our method offers a practical
drop-in tool for analyzing attention patterns and tracing information flow
without terabytes of caches. By making long context interpretability feasible
on consumer GPUs, Sparse Tracing helps democratize chain-of-thought monitoring.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注结构化数据，但忽略了临床笔记等非结构化文本数据中可能包含的HIV风险相关信息。

Method: 开发了一个基于大语言模型的流水线，用于分析非结构化的EHR文本数据。

Result: 在伊拉斯谟大学医学中心鹿特丹的临床数据上，该流水线实现了高准确率，同时保持了低假阴性率。

Conclusion: 该方法为利用非结构化EHR数据进行HIV筛查和早期诊断提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: Efficient screening and early diagnosis of HIV are critical for reducing
onward transmission. Although large scale laboratory testing is not feasible,
the widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers new
opportunities to address this challenge. Existing research primarily focuses on
applying machine learning methods to structured data, such as patient
demographics, for improving HIV diagnosis. However, these approaches often
overlook unstructured text data such as clinical notes, which potentially
contain valuable information relevant to HIV risk. In this study, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze
unstructured EHR text and determine a patient's eligibility for further HIV
testing. Experimental results on clinical data from Erasmus University Medical
Center Rotterdam demonstrate that our pipeline achieved high accuracy while
maintaining a low false negative rate.

TL;DR: 本研究首次通过专家评估对11个通用大语言模型在生命周期评估(LCA)领域的表现进行基准测试，发现37%的模型回答包含不准确或误导性信息，幻觉率高达40%，但模型在解释质量和格式遵循方面表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI和大语言模型在生命周期评估中的应用日益增多，但缺乏对其可靠性、鲁棒性和可用性的系统性评估证据，特别是在没有明确基准和共识协议的领域。

Method: 评估11个通用大语言模型在22个LCA相关任务上的表现，由17位经验丰富的从业者根据科学准确性、解释质量、鲁棒性、可验证性和指令遵循等标准审查模型输出，共收集168份专家评审。

Result: 专家判定37%的回答包含不准确或误导信息；准确性和解释质量评分普遍为中等或良好；格式遵循评分较高；幻觉率差异显著，某些模型产生幻觉引用的比例高达40%；开源模型与闭源模型在准确性和解释质量等标准上表现相当或更优。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在LCA中简单应用LLM的风险，特别是将LLM视为自由形式的神谕时，但也显示了在解释质量和减轻简单任务劳动强度方面的益处。没有基础机制支持的通用LLM使用存在风险。

Abstract: Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular large language
models (LLMs), are increasingly being explored as tools to support life cycle
assessment (LCA). While demonstrations exist across environmental and social
domains, systematic evidence on their reliability, robustness, and usability
remains limited. This study provides the first expert-grounded benchmark of
LLMs in LCA, addressing the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks in a
field where no clear ground truth or consensus protocols exist.
  Methods: We evaluated eleven general-purpose LLMs, spanning both commercial
and open-source families, across 22 LCA-related tasks. Seventeen experienced
practitioners reviewed model outputs against criteria directly relevant to LCA
practice, including scientific accuracy, explanation quality, robustness,
verifiability, and adherence to instructions. We collected 168 expert reviews.
  Results: Experts judged 37% of responses to contain inaccurate or misleading
information. Ratings of accuracy and quality of explanation were generally
rated average or good on many models even smaller models, and format adherence
was generally rated favourably. Hallucination rates varied significantly, with
some models producing hallucinated citations at rates of up to 40%. There was
no clear-cut distinction between ratings on open-weight versus closed-weight
LLMs, with open-weight models outperforming or competing on par with
closed-weight models on criteria such as accuracy and quality of explanation.
  Conclusion: These findings highlight the risks of applying LLMs na\"ively in
LCA, such as when LLMs are treated as free-form oracles, while also showing
benefits especially around quality of explanation and alleviating labour
intensiveness of simple tasks. The use of general-purpose LLMs without
grounding mechanisms presents ...

Motivation: 传统多模态大语言模型评估存在静态基准测试无法全面评估能力、人工或模型对比主观且昂贵、模型可能利用表面捷径（如冗长回答）来提升胜率等问题。

Method: 采用基于游戏的评估框架，具体使用Dixit幻想卡牌游戏，要求模型为卡牌生成既能欺骗部分玩家又不会欺骗所有玩家的描述，从而综合评估多种能力。

Result: 实验显示Dixit胜率排名与主流MLM基准测试排名完全一致，同时游戏过程揭示了MLM与人类玩家策略的差异以及MLM推理能力的改进空间。

Conclusion: 基于游戏的评估为多模态大语言模型提供了更全面、客观且有趣的评估框架，能够有效揭示模型能力的真实水平。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLMs) are often assessed on static,
individual benchmarks -- which cannot jointly assess MLM capabilities in a
single task -- or rely on human or model pairwise comparisons -- which is
highly subjective, expensive, and allows models to exploit superficial
shortcuts (e.g., verbosity) to inflate their win-rates. To overcome these
issues, we propose game-based evaluations to holistically assess MLM
capabilities. Games require multiple abilities for players to win, are
inherently competitive, and are governed by fix, objective rules, and makes
evaluation more engaging, providing a robust framework to address the
aforementioned challenges. We manifest this evaluation specifically through
Dixit, a fantasy card game where players must generate captions for a card that
trick some, but not all players, into selecting the played card. Our
quantitative experiments with five MLMs show Dixit win-rate rankings are
perfectly correlated with those on popular MLM benchmarks, while games between
human and MLM players in Dixit reveal several differences between agent
strategies and areas of improvement for MLM reasoning.

Motivation: 传统优化方法严重依赖领域专家将现实问题转化为可求解的数学模型，而现有LLM模型存在高成本和幻觉问题，限制了在供应链等实际场景中的应用。

Method: 系统评估DeepSeek-R1在四个运筹学基准测试上的表现，包括基线评估、幻觉分类开发，以及应用LLM-as-a-Judge、Few-shot Learning、Tool Calling和多智能体框架等缓解策略。

Result: DeepSeek-R1作为成本效益高且性能优越的模型，在LiveCodeBench和Math-500等基准测试中表现出色，但在应用运筹学场景中的有效性仍需进一步探索。

Conclusion: 通过系统评估和缓解策略应用，该研究旨在减少幻觉、提高建模准确性，并更好地使模型输出与用户意图保持一致。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with optimization modeling
offers a promising avenue for advancing decision-making in operations research
(OR). Traditional optimization methods,such as linear programming, mixed
integer programming, and simulation depend heavily on domain expertise to
translate real-world problems into solvable mathematical models. While solvers
like Gurobi and COPT are powerful, expert input remains essential for defining
objectives, constraints, and variables. This research investigates the
potential of LLMs, specifically the DeepSeek-R1 model, to bridge this
formulation gap using natural language understanding and code generation.
Although prior models like GPT-4, Claude, and Bard have shown strong
performance in NLP and reasoning tasks, their high token costs and tendency
toward hallucinations limit real-world applicability in supply chain contexts.
In contrast, DeepSeek-R1, a cost-efficient and high-performing model trained
with reinforcement learning, presents a viable alternative. Despite its success
in benchmarks such as LiveCodeBench and Math-500, its effectiveness in applied
OR scenarios remains under explored. This study systematically evaluates
DeepSeek-R1 across four key OR benchmarks: NL4OPT, IndustryOR, EasyLP, and
ComplexOR. Our methodology includes baseline assessments, the development of a
hallucination taxonomy, and the application of mitigation strategies like
LLM-as-a-Judge, Few-shot Learning (FSL), Tool Calling, and a Multi-agent
Framework. These techniques aim to reduce hallucinations, enhance formulation
accuracy, and better align model outputs with user intent.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于记忆增强的LLM代理框架，通过存储实例级批评和提炼任务级指导，无需参数更新就能从标记示例中学习分类函数，相比仅依赖标签的检索基线方法准确率提升高达24.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微调方法成本高、不灵活且不透明，需要探索无需参数更新的LLM学习方式，构建更适应性和可解释的LLM代理。

Method: 使用记忆增强框架，包含实例级批评的片段记忆和可重用任务指导的语义记忆，结合标记数据和LLM生成的批评，引入可暗示性指标解释模型对不同监督表示的反应。

Result: 在多样化任务集上，结合批评的方法比仅依赖标签的检索基线准确率提升高达24.8%，揭示了OpenAI和开源模型在处理事实导向与偏好数据时的行为差异。

Conclusion: 记忆驱动的反思学习为构建更适应性和可解释的LLM代理提供了前景，模型特性和记忆策略共同塑造学习动态。

Abstract: We investigate how agents built on pretrained large language models can learn
target classification functions from labeled examples without parameter
updates. While conventional approaches like fine-tuning are often costly,
inflexible, and opaque, we propose a memory-augmented framework that leverages
both labeled data and LLM-generated critiques. Our framework uses episodic
memory to store instance-level critiques-capturing specific past
experiences-and semantic memory to distill these into reusable, task-level
guidance. Across a diverse set of tasks, incorporating critiques yields up to a
24.8 percent accuracy improvement over retrieval-based (RAG-style) baselines
that rely only on labels. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we uncover
distinct behavioral differences between OpenAI and opensource models,
particularly in how they handle fact-oriented versus preference-based data. To
interpret how models respond to different representations of supervision
encoded in memory, we introduce a novel metric, suggestibility. This helps
explain observed behaviors and illuminates how model characteristics and memory
strategies jointly shape learning dynamics. Our findings highlight the promise
of memory-driven, reflective learning for building more adaptive and
interpretable LLM agents.

TL;DR: LyriCAR是一个无监督歌词翻译框架，通过难度感知课程设计和自适应课程策略，在减少40%训练步骤的同时实现最先进的翻译性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有歌词翻译方法依赖手工规则和句子级建模，难以内化音乐语言模式和在段落级别保持跨行连贯性和全局韵律

Method: 提出LyriCAR框架，包含难度感知课程设计师和自适应课程策略，以无监督方式引导模型逐步学习更复杂的挑战

Result: 在英中歌词翻译任务上，LyriCAR在标准翻译指标和多维奖励分数上都达到了最先进水平，自适应课程策略减少近40%训练步骤

Conclusion: LyriCAR通过课程学习有效解决了歌词翻译中的音乐约束平衡问题，证明了无监督方法在复杂翻译任务中的潜力

Abstract: Lyric translation is a challenging task that requires balancing multiple
musical constraints. Existing methods often rely on hand-crafted rules and
sentence-level modeling, which restrict their ability to internalize
musical-linguistic patterns and to generalize effectively at the paragraph
level, where cross-line coherence and global rhyme are crucial. In this work,
we propose LyriCAR, a novel framework for controllable lyric translation that
operates in a fully unsupervised manner. LyriCAR introduces a difficulty-aware
curriculum designer and an adaptive curriculum strategy, ensuring efficient
allocation of training resources, accelerating convergence, and improving
overall translation quality by guiding the model with increasingly complex
challenges. Extensive experiments on the EN-ZH lyric translation task show that
LyriCAR achieves state-of-the-art results across both standard translation
metrics and multi-dimensional reward scores, surpassing strong baselines.
Notably, the adaptive curriculum strategy reduces training steps by nearly 40%
while maintaining superior performance. Code, data and model can be accessed at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合大语言模型和符号自然语言理解的混合方法，旨在获得两种方法的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型存在幻觉和输出结构不一致的问题，而符号NLU系统虽然可解释性强但覆盖范围有限，需要专业知识维护。

Method: 使用LLM进行重述和文本简化以提供广泛覆盖，使用符号NLU生成可用于推理和增量学习的结构化关系表示。

Result: 在从常识科学文本中提取和解释数量和因果规律的任务上，混合方法显著优于纯符号方法。

Conclusion: 混合方法结合了LLM的广泛覆盖能力和符号NLU的结构化表示优势，取得了更好的效果。

Abstract: Despite the broad applicability of large language models (LLMs), their
reliance on probabilistic inference makes them vulnerable to errors such as
hallucination in generated facts and inconsistent output structure in natural
language understanding (NLU) tasks. By contrast, symbolic NLU systems provide
interpretable understanding grounded in curated lexicons, semantic resources,
and syntactic & semantic interpretation rules. They produce relational
representations that can be used for accurate reasoning and planning, as well
as incremental debuggable learning. However, symbolic NLU systems tend to be
more limited in coverage than LLMs and require scarce knowledge representation
and linguistics skills to extend and maintain. This paper explores a hybrid
approach that integrates the broad-coverage language processing of LLMs with
the symbolic NLU capabilities of producing structured relational
representations to hopefully get the best of both approaches. We use LLMs for
rephrasing and text simplification, to provide broad coverage, and as a source
of information to fill in knowledge gaps more automatically. We use symbolic
NLU to produce representations that can be used for reasoning and for
incremental learning. We evaluate this approach on the task of extracting and
interpreting quantities and causal laws from commonsense science texts, along
with symbolic- and LLM-only pipelines. Our results suggest that our hybrid
method works significantly better than the symbolic-only pipeline.

Motivation: 现有医学数据集如MedQA主要依赖简化的问答形式，无法充分代表真实世界的临床决策过程，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 提出基于临床背景和临床问题两个维度的统一评估范式，总结现有数据集设置，并回顾训练时和测试时的技术方法。

Result: 建立了临床决策任务的分类框架，明确了不同难度级别的评估标准，扩展了评估维度至效率、可解释性等方面。

Conclusion: 该范式有助于澄清假设、标准化比较，并指导开发具有临床意义的LLMs，同时指出了未来面临的挑战。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical use. They are often
evaluated using datasets such as MedQA. However, Many medical datasets, such as
MedQA, rely on simplified Question-Answering (Q\A) that underrepresents
real-world clinical decision-making. Based on this, we propose a unifying
paradigm that characterizes clinical decision-making tasks along two
dimensions: Clinical Backgrounds and Clinical Questions. As the background and
questions approach the real clinical environment, the difficulty increases. We
summarize the settings of existing datasets and benchmarks along two
dimensions. Then we review methods to address clinical decision-making,
including training-time and test-time techniques, and summarize when they help.
Next, we extend evaluation beyond accuracy to include efficiency,
explainability. Finally, we highlight open challenges. Our paradigm clarifies
assumptions, standardizes comparisons, and guides the development of clinically
meaningful LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了希腊语嵌入模型(GEM)，通过精心构建的大规模希腊语语料库和现代架构(如ELECTRA、ConvBERT、ModernBERT)，解决了希腊语NLP研究中架构单一、上下文长度受限的问题，特别是在法律领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希腊语等形态丰富的中等资源语言在NLP研究中面临研究分散、架构多样性不足和上下文长度受限的问题，特别是在法律领域，现有模型通常局限于早期Transformer架构和512个token的窗口，无法处理长法律文档。

Method: 通过严格的质量驱动数据筛选和预处理方法构建大规模希腊语语料库，包括通用领域和专门法律来源；在此基础上预训练并系统评估多种现代架构；还提出了首个针对法律领域的希腊语-英语双语嵌入模型。

Result: 在下游任务上的广泛实验表明，新模型类别证明了所提方法的有效性，GEM-RoBERTa和GEM-ConvBERT模型显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 通过精心策划的数据和现代架构多样性，成功提升了希腊语NLP性能，特别是在法律领域，为中等资源语言的NLP研究提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The advancement of natural language processing for morphologically rich,
moderately-resourced languages like Modern Greek is often hindered by a
fragmented research landscape, a lack of architectural diversity and reliance
on limited context-length models. This is particularly true in specialized,
high-value domains such as law, where existing models are frequently confined
to early transformer architectures with a restrictive 512-token window,
insufficient for analyzing long legal documents. To address these challenges,
this paper presents Greek Embedding Models, a new family of transformer models
for Greek language built upon a foundation of extensive, quality-driven data
curation. We detail the construction of several large-scale Greek corpora,
emphasizing a rigorous, quality-based filtering and preprocessing methodology
to create high-value training datasets from both general-domain and specialized
legal sources. On this carefully curated foundation, we pre-train and
systematically evaluate a diverse suite of modern architectures, which has not
previously applied to Greek language, such as ELECTRA, ConvBERT and ModernBERT.
Furthermore, we propose the first bilingual Greek-English Embedding Models
tailored for the legal domain. The extensive experiments on downstream tasks
demonstrate that the new class of models establish the effectiveness of the
proposed approach, highlighting that the GEM-RoBERTa and GEM-ConvBERT models
significantly outperform existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练语言模型在序列标注任务中的迁移学习效果仍有提升空间，需要更有效的适应方法来充分发挥其潜力。

Method: 1. 多任务模型：引入领域无关文本处理系统的额外信号；2. 架构修改：在自回归大语言模型中实现跨层双向信息流；3. 生成式监督上下文微调框架：结合响应导向的适应策略。

Result: 提出的模型、方法和框架表明，通过有针对性的迁移学习范式，预训练神经语言模型在序列标注任务上能达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: 预训练神经语言模型在序列标注任务中的最佳性能需要通过针对性的迁移学习策略来实现，包括多任务学习、架构修改和上下文微调等方法。

Abstract: This doctoral thesis improves the transfer learning for sequence labeling
tasks by adapting pre-trained neural language models. The proposed improvements
in transfer learning involve introducing a multi-task model that incorporates
an additional signal, a method based on architectural modifications in
autoregressive large language models, and a sequence labeling framework for
autoregressive large language models utilizing supervised in-context
fine-tuning combined with response-oriented adaptation strategies. The first
improvement is given in the context of domain transfer for the event trigger
detection task. The domain transfer of the event trigger detection task can be
improved by incorporating an additional signal obtained from a
domain-independent text processing system into a multi-task model. The second
improvement involves modifying the model's architecture. For that purpose, a
method is proposed to enable bidirectional information flow across layers of
autoregressive large language models. The third improvement utilizes
autoregressive large language models as text generators through a generative
supervised in-context fine-tuning framework. The proposed model, method, and
framework demonstrate that pre-trained neural language models achieve their
best performance on sequence labeling tasks when adapted through targeted
transfer learning paradigms.

TL;DR: ToolScope通过自动合并冗余工具和检索相关工具，解决LLM工具选择中的冗余和上下文限制问题，显著提升工具选择准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界工具集存在冗余工具，工具名称和描述重叠导致歧义，降低选择准确性；LLM面临严格的输入上下文限制，无法有效处理大型工具集

Method: ToolScope包含两个组件：ToolScopeMerger（带自动校正功能）自动审计和修复工具合并以减少冗余；ToolScopeRetriever对工具进行排序和选择，仅保留最相关工具以适应上下文限制

Result: 在三个最先进LLM和三个开源工具使用基准测试中，工具选择准确率提升8.38%至38.6%

Conclusion: ToolScope能有效增强LLM工具使用能力，解决工具冗余和上下文限制问题

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents rely on external tools to solve complex
tasks, but real-world toolsets often contain redundant tools with overlapping
names and descriptions, introducing ambiguity and reducing selection accuracy.
LLMs also face strict input context limits, preventing efficient consideration
of large toolsets. To address these challenges, we propose ToolScope, which
includes: (1) ToolScopeMerger with Auto-Correction to automatically audit and
fix tool merges, reducing redundancy, and (2) ToolScopeRetriever to rank and
select only the most relevant tools for each query, compressing toolsets to fit
within context limits without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluations on three
state-of-the-art LLMs and three open-source tool-use benchmarks show gains of
8.38% to 38.6% in tool selection accuracy, demonstrating ToolScope's
effectiveness in enhancing LLM tool use.

Motivation: 现有多语言基准在捕捉低资源文化细微差别方面存在不足，需要专门的文化知识评估数据集来填补这一空白。

Method: 构建了包含民间传统、烹饪艺术和地区方言的孟加拉语文化知识数据集BLanCK，并测试了多个多语言语言模型在该数据集上的表现。

Result: 多语言模型在非文化类别表现良好，但在文化知识方面表现显著较差；当提供上下文时，所有模型的性能都得到显著提升。

Abstract: Recent progress in NLP research has demonstrated remarkable capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks. While recent
multilingual benchmarks have advanced cultural evaluation for LLMs, critical
gaps remain in capturing the nuances of low-resource cultures. Our work
addresses these limitations through a Bengali Language Cultural Knowledge
(BLanCK) dataset including folk traditions, culinary arts, and regional
dialects. Our investigation of several multilingual language models shows that
while these models perform well in non-cultural categories, they struggle
significantly with cultural knowledge and performance improves substantially
across all models when context is provided, emphasizing context-aware
architectures and culturally curated training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升小型语言模型在专业领域（如医疗问答）的推理能力，特别是在波斯语等资源稀缺语言中，解决数据有限的问题。

Method: 将多选医疗问答数据集翻译成波斯语，使用RLAIF生成拒绝-偏好答案对，通过教师和学生模型产生Chain-of-Thought推理响应，构建包含正确和错误推理轨迹的数据集用于DPO训练。

Result: 训练后的模型在医疗推理能力上显著提升，仅使用450万token的数据集就超越了基于5700万token预训练的gaokerena-V模型。

Conclusion: 推理导向的训练方法在数据有限的情况下开发领域特定语言模型具有高效性和有效性。

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities in small language models is critical for
specialized applications such as medical question answering, particularly in
underrepresented languages like Persian. In this study, we employ Reinforcement
Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to
improve the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To
achieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering
dataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer
pairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and
student models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we
compiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories.
This dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million
tokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly
enhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the
resulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on
approximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset.
These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning-focused
training approaches in developing domain-specific language models with limited
data availability.

TL;DR: 提出了CreativityPrism框架，将创造力分解为质量、新颖性和多样性三个维度，用于全面评估大语言模型在不同领域的创造力表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型创造力评估方法碎片化，缺乏统一的评估框架，难以在不同领域和任务间进行一致比较。

Method: 构建CreativityPrism框架，包含发散思维、创意写作和逻辑推理三个领域，9个任务和20个评估指标，对17个最先进的专有和开源大语言模型进行评估。

Result: 专有模型与开源模型存在显著差距；同一领域内任务表现高度相关，跨领域相关性较弱；多样性与质量指标强相关，而新颖性与其他维度相关性较弱。

Conclusion: 创造力评估需要全面框架，单一任务或维度的表现不能推广到其他方面，支持了创造力不是单一固定概念的观点。

Abstract: Creativity is often seen as a hallmark of human intelligence. While large
language models (LLMs) are increasingly perceived as producing creative text,
there is still no holistic framework to evaluate their creativity across
diverse scenarios. Existing evaluation methods remain fragmented, with dramatic
variation across domains and tasks, largely due to differing definitions and
measurements of creativity. Inspired by the hypothesis that creativity is not
one fixed idea, we propose CreativityPrism, an evaluation analysis framework
that decomposes creativity into three dimensions: quality, novelty, and
diversity. CreativityPrism incorporates nine tasks, three domains, i.e.,
divergent thinking, creative writing, and logical reasoning, and twenty
evaluation metrics, which measure each dimension in task-specific, unique ways.
We evaluate 17 state-of-the-art (SoTA) proprietary and open-sourced LLMs on
CreativityPrism and analyze the performance correlations among different
metrics and task domains. Our results reveal a notable gap between proprietary
and open-source models. Overall, model performance tends to be highly
correlated across tasks within the same domain and less so across different
domains. Among evaluation dimensions, diversity and quality metrics show strong
correlations - models that perform well on one often excel on the other -
whereas novelty exhibits much weaker correlation with either. These findings
support our hypothesis that strong performance in one creativity task or
dimension does not necessarily generalize to others, underscoring the need for
a holistic evaluation of LLM creativity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统实体链接方法依赖大量标注数据和模型微调，而现有few-shot方法虽然减少了训练需求，但存在LLM推理效率低下的问题。

Method: ARTER采用结构化流水线，计算互补信号对候选实体进行分类，将上下文提及分为简单和困难案例，分别由低计算量实体链接器和针对性LLM推理处理。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，ARTER比ReFinED性能提升最高达4.47%，在6个数据集中的5个上平均提升2.53%，与全LLM推理方法性能相当但LLM token使用量减少一半。

Conclusion: ARTER证明了通过自适应路由和选择性推理，可以在不牺牲性能的前提下显著提高实体链接的效率。

Abstract: Entity Linking (EL) has traditionally relied on large annotated datasets and
extensive model fine-tuning. While recent few-shot methods leverage large
language models (LLMs) through prompting to reduce training requirements, they
often suffer from inefficiencies due to expensive LLM-based reasoning. ARTER
(Adaptive Routing and Targeted Entity Reasoning) presents a structured pipeline
that achieves high performance without deep fine-tuning by strategically
combining candidate generation, context-based scoring, adaptive routing, and
selective reasoning. ARTER computes a small set of complementary signals(both
embedding and LLM-based) over the retrieved candidates to categorize contextual
mentions into easy and hard cases. The cases are then handled by a
low-computational entity linker (e.g. ReFinED) and more expensive targeted
LLM-based reasoning respectively. On standard benchmarks, ARTER outperforms
ReFinED by up to +4.47%, with an average gain of +2.53% on 5 out of 6 datasets,
and performs comparably to pipelines using LLM-based reasoning for all
mentions, while being as twice as efficient in terms of the number of LLM
tokens.

TL;DR: BoundRL是一种高效的方法，用于对长结构化文本进行标记级分割和标签预测，通过仅生成起始标记序列来重构内容，大幅降低推理成本并减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着结构化文本在技术报告和生成式AI提示等领域的复杂性增加，传统句子或段落级分割方法无法有效处理包含表格、代码片段和占位符等元素的文本，需要更有效的语义分割方法。

Method: BoundRL采用强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR），通过生成起始标记序列来重构文本内容，并设计特定奖励函数联合优化文档重构保真度和语义对齐。为避免熵崩溃，还通过系统扰动生成的分割序列构建中间候选方案。

Result: 实验表明，BoundRL使小型语言模型（1.7B参数）在复杂LLM应用提示的分割任务上优于大型模型的少样本提示。RLVR相比监督微调有显著改进，加入中间候选方案进一步提升了性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: BoundRL为处理复杂结构化文本提供了一种高效的分割方法，通过创新的强化学习框架和中间候选策略，在保持高质量分割的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: As structured texts become increasingly complex across diverse domains --
from technical reports to generative AI prompts -- the need for text
segmentation into semantically meaningful components becomes critical. Such
texts often contain elements beyond plain language, including tables, code
snippets, and placeholders, which conventional sentence- or paragraph-level
segmentation methods cannot handle effectively. To address this challenge, we
propose BoundRL, a novel and efficient approach that jointly performs
token-level text segmentation and label prediction for long structured texts.
Instead of generating complete contents for each segment, it generates only a
sequence of starting tokens and reconstructs the complete contents by locating
these tokens within the original texts, thereby reducing inference costs by
orders of magnitude and minimizing hallucination. To adapt the model for the
output format, BoundRL~performs reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards
(RLVR) with a specifically designed reward that jointly optimizes document
reconstruction fidelity and semantic alignment. To mitigate entropy collapse,
it further constructs intermediate candidates by systematically perturbing a
fraction of generated sequences of segments to create stepping stones toward
higher-quality solutions. To demonstrate BoundRL's effectiveness on
particularly challenging structured texts, we focus evaluation on complex
prompts used for LLM applications. Experiments show that BoundRL enables small
language models (1.7B parameters) to outperform few-shot prompting of much
larger models. Moreover, RLVR with our designed reward yields significant
improvements over supervised fine-tuning, and incorporating intermediate
candidates further improves both performance and generalization.

### [107] [Are Stereotypes Leading LLMs' Zero-Shot Stance Detection ?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20154)
*Anthony Dubreuil,Antoine Gourru,Christine Largeron,Amine Trabelsi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了大型语言模型在零样本立场检测任务中的偏见问题，发现模型存在显著的刻板印象，如将支持大麻的观点与低文本复杂度关联，将非裔美国人方言与反对特朗普关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型从预训练数据中继承了刻板印象，导致在自然语言处理任务中对某些社会群体产生偏见行为。然而，立场检测方法中的这种偏见评估在社区中被很大程度上忽视了。

Method: 通过自动标注现有立场检测数据集中的帖子，使用两个属性：特定群体的方言或俚语，以及文本复杂度/可读性，来研究这些属性是否影响模型的立场检测决策。

Result: 结果显示，LLMs在立场检测任务中表现出显著的刻板印象，例如错误地将支持大麻的观点与低文本复杂度关联，将非裔美国人方言与反对特朗普关联。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在零样本立场检测中存在显著的偏见问题，需要进一步关注和解决模型对社会群体的刻板印象问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models inherit stereotypes from their pretraining data,
leading to biased behavior toward certain social groups in many Natural
Language Processing tasks, such as hateful speech detection or sentiment
analysis. Surprisingly, the evaluation of this kind of bias in stance detection
methods has been largely overlooked by the community. Stance Detection involves
labeling a statement as being against, in favor, or neutral towards a specific
target and is among the most sensitive NLP tasks, as it often relates to
political leanings. In this paper, we focus on the bias of Large Language
Models when performing stance detection in a zero-shot setting. We
automatically annotate posts in pre-existing stance detection datasets with two
attributes: dialect or vernacular of a specific group and text
complexity/readability, to investigate whether these attributes influence the
model's stance detection decisions. Our results show that LLMs exhibit
significant stereotypes in stance detection tasks, such as incorrectly
associating pro-marijuana views with low text complexity and African American
dialect with opposition to Donald Trump.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepWideSearch是首个专门评估信息搜索代理在深度推理和广度信息收集方面能力的基准，包含220个跨15个领域的问题，现有最先进代理成功率仅2.39%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前搜索代理缺乏同时进行深度多跳推理和广域信息收集的能力，这在市场分析等实际应用中至关重要。

Method: 通过转换现有数据集构建了包含220个问题的基准，这些问题需要处理大量数据并进行深度多跳检索推理。

Result: 实验显示最先进代理在DeepWideSearch上的平均成功率仅为2.39%，揭示了当前代理架构在整合深度和广度搜索方面的重大挑战。

Conclusion: 该基准暴露了当前代理的四大失败模式：缺乏反思、过度依赖内部知识、检索不足和上下文溢出，为开发更强大信息搜索代理提供了研究方向。

Abstract: Current search agents fundamentally lack the ability to simultaneously
perform \textit{deep} reasoning over multi-hop retrieval and
\textit{wide}-scale information collection-a critical deficiency for real-world
applications like comprehensive market analysis and business development. To
bridge this gap, we introduce DeepWideSearch, the first benchmark explicitly
designed to evaluate agents to integrate depth and width in information
seeking. In DeepWideSearch, agents must process a large volume of data, each
requiring deep reasoning over multi-hop retrieval paths. Specifically, we
propose two methods to converse established datasets, resulting in a curated
collection of 220 questions spanning 15 diverse domains. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art agents achieve only 2.39% average
success rate on DeepWideSearch, highlighting the substantial challenge of
integrating depth and width search in information-seeking tasks. Furthermore,
our error analysis reveals four failure modes: lack of reflection, overreliance
on internal knowledge, insufficient retrieval, and context overflow-exposing
key limitations in current agent architectures. We publicly release
DeepWideSearch to catalyze future research on more capable and robust
information-seeking agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM表格推理方法存在局限性：微调方法容易产生算术错误和幻觉，工具方法依赖刚性模式且缺乏语义理解。需要结合稳健推理与可靠表格处理的方法。

Method: 使用三智能体框架（规划、编码、回答），通过代码执行进行精确表格操作，并采用MCTS生成伪黄金轨迹和强化学习优化智能体。

Result: 在TableBench上达到62.13%的准确率，超过了OpenAI-o4-mini-high。

Conclusion: 结合结构化多智能体工作流与强化学习在表格理解方面具有前景。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over tables is a critical capability for many
real-world applications. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise on
this task, but current approaches remain limited. Fine-tuning based methods
strengthen language reasoning; yet they are prone to arithmetic errors and
hallucination. In contrast, tool-based methods enable precise table
manipulation but rely on rigid schemas and lack semantic understanding. These
complementary drawbacks highlight the need for approaches that integrate robust
reasoning with reliable table processing. In this work, we propose
Mixture-of-Minds, a multi-agent framework that decomposes table reasoning into
three specialized roles: planning, coding, and answering. This design enables
each agent to focus on a specific aspect of the task while leveraging code
execution for precise table manipulation. Building on this workflow, we
introduce a self-improvement training framework that employs Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) rollouts to generate pseudo-gold trajectories and optimize agents
with reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive experiments show that
Mixture-of-Minds delivers substantial gains, reaching 62.13% on TableBench and
surpassing OpenAI-o4-mini-high. These results demonstrate the promise of
combining structured multi-agent workflows with RL to advance table
understanding.

TL;DR: 本文通过五个任务测试大型语言模型在文本输入下的空间推理能力，发现模型在小规模任务中表现中等，但随着复杂度增加性能急剧下降，平均准确率下降42.7%，最高达84%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在文本输入下的空间推理能力，评估其空间理解和计算能力，揭示语言与空间推理之间的差距。

Method: 使用五个任务测试模型：象限识别、几何变换、距离评估、单词搜索和瓷砖滑动，通过增加网格维度来扩展任务复杂度。

Result: LLMs在小规模任务中表现中等，但随着复杂度增加性能急剧下降，平均准确率损失42.7%，最高达84%。所有初始准确率超过50%的测试都至少损失48%的准确率。

Conclusion: LLMs缺乏稳健的空间表征能力，其空间推理能力随复杂度增加而显著恶化，突显了语言与空间推理之间的差距，为未来语言与几何交叉领域的基准测试奠定基础。

Abstract: This paper explores the spatial reasoning capability of large language models
(LLMs) over textual input through a suite of five tasks aimed at probing their
spatial understanding and computational abilities. The models were tested on
both fundamental spatial reasoning and multi-step problem-solving within
structured grid-based environments using tasks such as quadrant identification,
geometric transformations, distance evaluation, word searches, and tile
sliding. Each task was scaled in complexity through increasing grid dimensions,
requiring models to extend beyond simple pattern recognition into abstract
spatial reasoning. Our results reveal that while LLMs demonstrate moderate
success in all tasks with small complexity and size, performance drops off
rapidly as scale increases, with an average loss in accuracy of 42.7%, and
reaching as high as 84%. Every test that began with over 50% accuracy showed a
loss of at least 48%, illustrating the consistent nature of the deterioration.
Furthermore, their struggles with scaling complexity hint at a lack of robust
spatial representations in their underlying architectures. This paper
underscores the gap between linguistic and spatial reasoning in LLMs, offering
insights into their current limitations, and laying the groundwork for future
integrative benchmarks at the intersection of language and geometry.

*David Pohl,Marco Cognetta,Junyoung Lee,Naoaki Okazaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种解码无关的采样策略，用于近似计算语言模型对文本所有可能分词方式的概率边际化，相比传统采样方法大幅降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型基于子词分词，但只评估特定输出分词的概率，而忽略同一文本可能有多种分词方式。传统边际化采样需要昂贵的生成步骤，限制了采样数量和近似精度。

Method: 研究解码无关的采样策略，这些策略不需要语言模型生成文本，而是使用模型和分词器无关的廉价采样方法，仅计算给定分词序列的概率。

Result: 解码无关采样策略在多个开源模型上提供了足够准确的边际估计，同时运行时间成本仅为传统方法的一小部分。

Conclusion: 解码无关采样策略能够以较低成本有效近似语言模型的概率边际化，适用于下游推理任务。

Abstract: Modern language models operate on subword-tokenized text in order to make a
trade-off between model size, inference speed, and vocabulary coverage. A side
effect of this is that, during inference, models are evaluated by measuring the
probability of only the specific tokenization produced as the output, despite
there being many possible ways to represent the same text with a subword
vocabulary. Recent studies have argued instead for evaluating LLMs by
marginalization - the probability mass of all tokenizations of a given text.
  Marginalization is difficult due to the number of possible tokenizations of a
text, so often approximate marginalization is done via sampling. However, a
downside of sampling is that an expensive generation step must be performed by
the LLM for each sample, which limits the number of samples that can be
acquired given a runtime budget, and therefore also the accuracy of the
approximation. Since computing the probability of a sequence given the
tokenization is relatively cheap compared to actually generating it, we
investigate sampling strategies that are decoding-free - they require no
generation from the LLM, instead relying entirely on extremely cheap sampling
strategies that are model and tokenizer agnostic.
  We investigate the approximation quality and speed of decoding-free sampling
strategies for a number of open models to find that they provide sufficiently
accurate marginal estimates at a small fraction of the runtime cost and
demonstrate its use on a set of downstream inference tasks.

### [112] [Tri-Modal Severity Fused Diagnosis across Depression and Post-traumatic Stress Disorders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20239)
*Filippo Cenacchi,Deborah Richards,Longbing Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的三模态情感严重程度框架，通过融合文本、音频和面部信号来评估抑郁和PTSD的严重程度，在多模态融合中优于单模态基线，并提供可解释的特征归因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁和创伤后应激障碍(PTSD)经常共病且症状相互关联，而现有的自动化评估通常是二元分类且针对单一障碍。临床上需要能够评估严重程度并提供跨障碍解释的诊断工具。

Method: 开发了三模态情感严重程度框架：同步融合访谈文本（句子级transformer嵌入）、音频（log Mel统计特征）和面部信号（动作单元、注视、头部姿态描述符），通过校准的晚期融合分类器输出抑郁(PHQ-8; 5类)和PTSD(3类)的严重程度分级概率。

Result: 在DAIC数据集上的分层交叉验证显示，融合模型在准确率和加权F1分数上与最强单模态基线相当，同时提高了决策曲线效用和对噪声或缺失模态的鲁棒性。对于PTSD，融合减少了回归误差并改善了类别一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了可重复的评估和临床决策支持，文本对抑郁严重程度贡献最大，音频和面部线索对PTSD至关重要，特征归因与语言和行为标记一致。

Abstract: Depression and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often co-occur with
connected symptoms, complicating automated assessment, which is often binary
and disorder specific. Clinically useful diagnosis needs severity aware cross
disorder estimates and decision support explanations. Our unified tri modal
affective severity framework synchronizes and fuses interview text with
sentence level transformer embeddings, audio with log Mel statistics with
deltas, and facial signals with action units, gaze, head and pose descriptors
to output graded severities for diagnosing both depression (PHQ-8; 5 classes)
and PTSD (3 classes). Standardized features are fused via a calibrated late
fusion classifier, yielding per disorder probabilities and feature-level
attributions. This severity aware tri-modal affective fusion approach is demoed
on multi disorder concurrent depression and PTSD assessment. Stratified cross
validation on DAIC derived corpora outperforms unimodal/ablation baselines. The
fused model matches the strongest unimodal baseline on accuracy and weighted
F1, while improving decision curve utility and robustness under noisy or
missing modalities. For PTSD specifically, fusion reduces regression error and
improves class concordance. Errors cluster between adjacent severities; extreme
classes are identified reliably. Ablations show text contributes most to
depression severity, audio and facial cues are critical for PTSD, whereas
attributions align with linguistic and behavioral markers. Our approach offers
reproducible evaluation and clinician in the loop support for affective
clinical decision making.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ContextLM框架通过引入next-context预测目标增强标准预训练，在保持自回归评估兼容性的同时提升语言模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统next-token预测限制了模型捕捉高级语义结构和长距离上下文关系的能力

Method: 在标准预训练基础上增加next-context预测目标，学习多token上下文的预测表示，利用未来token块的错误信号

Result: 在GPT2和Pythia模型家族上实验表明，ContextLM在困惑度和下游任务性能上均带来一致改进

Conclusion: next-context预测为更强语言建模提供了可扩展且高效的途径，能产生更好的长距离连贯性和更有效的注意力分配

Abstract: Next-token prediction (NTP) is the cornerstone of modern large language
models (LLMs) pretraining, driving their unprecedented capabilities in text
generation, reasoning, and instruction following. However, the token-level
prediction limits the model's capacity to capture higher-level semantic
structures and long-range contextual relationships. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce \textbf{ContextLM}, a framework that augments standard
pretraining with an inherent \textbf{next-context prediction} objective. This
mechanism trains the model to learn predictive representations of multi-token
contexts, leveraging error signals derived from future token chunks. Crucially,
ContextLM achieves this enhancement while remaining fully compatible with the
standard autoregressive, token-by-token evaluation paradigm (e.g., perplexity).
Extensive experiments on the GPT2 and Pythia model families, scaled up to
$1.5$B parameters, show that ContextLM delivers consistent improvements in both
perplexity and downstream task performance. Our analysis indicates that
next-context prediction provides a scalable and efficient pathway to stronger
language modeling, yielding better long-range coherence and more effective
attention allocation with minimal computational overhead.

TL;DR: 该论文提出将引用失败与响应失败区分开来，研究引用失败的发生条件及其缓解方法，并开发了CITECONTROL基准和CITENTION框架来改善LLM引用性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的RAG系统中的引用功能在验证响应时存在引用失败问题，即模型生成有用响应但未能完整引用证据。需要将引用失败与响应失败区分开来，专门研究引用失败的发生机制和解决方案。

Method: 采用两步法：1) 研究响应与证据间关系如何影响引用质量，开发CITECONTROL基准系统分析失败模式；2) 提出CITENTION框架，集成生成式、基于注意力和基于检索的方法来高效改善LLM引用。

Result: 实验表明引用失败随关系复杂性增加而增加，组合多种引用方法可提升性能。CITENTION框架在CITECONTROL基准和迁移设置中均显著改善了引用效果。

Conclusion: 通过区分引用失败与响应失败，系统分析引用失败机制，并开发集成多种方法的框架，能够有效提升LLM在RAG系统中的引用性能，为响应验证提供更可靠的支持。

Abstract: Citations from LLM-based RAG systems are supposed to simplify response
verification. However, this does not hold for citation failure, when a model
generates a helpful response, but fails to cite complete evidence. In contrast
to previous work, we propose to disentangle this from response failure, where
the response itself is flawed, and citing complete evidence is impossible. To
address citation failure, this work follows a two-step approach: (1) We study
when citation failure occurs and (2) how it can be mitigated. For step 1, we
extend prior work by investigating how the relation between response and
evidence affects citation quality. We introduce CITECONTROL, a benchmark that
systematically varies this relation to analyze failure modes. Experiments show
that failures increase with relational complexity and suggest that combining
citation methods could improve performance, motivating step 2. To improve LLM
citation efficiently, we propose CITENTION, a framework integrating generative,
attention-based, and retrieval-based methods. Results demonstrate substantial
citation improvements on CITECONTROL and in transfer settings. We make our data
and code publicly available.

Motivation: 过程奖励模型在复杂推理任务中表现良好，但在处理半结构化数据（如表格问答）方面的适用性尚未探索。表格问答存在信息冗余、推理步骤松散、领域特定推理等独特挑战。

Method: 在表格问答任务上评估最先进的生成式过程奖励模型，从答案和步骤两个角度进行分析，结合文本和代码验证方法。

Result: PRMs结合文本和代码验证能帮助解决方案选择，但在领域外数据上泛化能力差。步骤级验证性能与答案准确性相关性弱，可能源于步骤依赖性和因果联系松散。

Conclusion: 当前PRMs在表格问答任务中存在局限性，研究结果为构建更鲁棒的过程感知验证器提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) improve complex reasoning in large language
models (LLMs) by grading candidate solutions step-by-step and selecting answers
via aggregated step scores. While effective in domains such as mathematics,
their applicability to tasks involving semi-structured data, like table
question answering (TQA) remains unexplored. TQA poses unique challenges for
PRMs, including abundant irrelevant information, loosely connected reasoning
steps, and domain-specific reasoning. This work presents the first systematic
study of PRMs for TQA. We evaluate state-of-the-art generative PRMs on TQA from
both answer and step perspectives. Results show that PRMs that combine textual
and code verification can aid solution selection but struggle to generalize to
out-of-domain data. Analysis reveals a weak correlation between performance in
step-level verification and answer accuracy, possibly stemming from weak step
dependencies and loose causal links. Our findings highlight limitations of
current PRMs on TQA and offer valuable insights for building more robust,
process-aware verifiers.

Motivation: 大型推理模型在处理复杂数学运算时存在效率低和准确性差的问题，而集成代码解释器时又面临内部概率推理与外部确定性知识之间的冲突，导致无效的思考过程。

Method: 提出CoRT框架，采用提示工程策略在推理路径中注入多样化提示，生成高质量代码集成推理数据，通过监督微调、拒绝采样和强化学习来优化模型与代码解释器的交互。

Conclusion: CoRT框架有效解决了大型推理模型与代码解释器集成时的冲突问题，显著提升了数学推理性能和效率。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI-o1 have shown impressive
capabilities in natural language reasoning. However, these models frequently
demonstrate inefficiencies or inaccuracies when tackling complex mathematical
operations. While integrating computational tools such as Code Interpreters
(CIs) offers a promising solution, it introduces a critical challenge: a
conflict between the model's internal, probabilistic reasoning and the
external, deterministic knowledge provided by the CI, which often leads models
to unproductive deliberation. To overcome this, we introduce CoRT
(Code-Optimized Reasoning Training), a post-training framework designed to
teach LRMs to effectively utilize CIs. We propose \emph{Hint-Engineering}, a
new data synthesis strategy that strategically injects diverse hints at optimal
points within reasoning paths. This approach generates high-quality,
code-integrated reasoning data specifically tailored to optimize LRM-CI
interaction. Using this method, we have synthesized 30 high-quality samples to
post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters through supervised
fine-tuning. CoRT further refines the multi-round interleaving of external CI
usage and internal thinking by employing rejection sampling and reinforcement
learning. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate CoRT's effectiveness,
yielding absolute improvements of 4\% and 8\% on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B
and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, respectively, across five challenging
mathematical reasoning datasets. Moreover, CoRT significantly enhances
efficiency, reducing token usage by approximately 30\% for the 32B model and
50\% for the 1.5B model compared to pure natural language reasoning baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在表格推理任务中的表现可能受到数据集污染的影响，特别是当数据集包含语义线索时，模型性能显著提升；去除语义线索后性能降至随机水平，表明其能力可能源于记忆而非真实推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在结构化数据上的推理能力时，往往忽略了数据集污染这一混淆因素，需要探究LLMs是否对广泛使用的表格基准数据集存在先验知识。

Method: 通过一系列受控探测实验，研究LLMs在包含语义线索（如有意义列名、可解释值类别）的数据集与去除/随机化语义线索的数据集上的表现差异。

Result: 当数据集包含强语义线索时，LLMs表现出污染效应；当语义线索被移除或随机化后，性能急剧下降至接近随机水平。

Conclusion: LLMs在表格推理任务中的表面能力可能部分反映了对公开数据集的记忆，而非真正的泛化能力，需要改进评估协议以区分语义泄漏与真实推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on their ability to
reason over structured data, yet such assessments often overlook a crucial
confound: dataset contamination. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit prior knowledge of widely used tabular benchmarks such as Adult Income,
Titanic, and others. Through a series of controlled probing experiments, we
reveal that contamination effects emerge exclusively for datasets containing
strong semantic cues-for instance, meaningful column names or interpretable
value categories. In contrast, when such cues are removed or randomized,
performance sharply declines to near-random levels. These findings suggest that
LLMs' apparent competence on tabular reasoning tasks may, in part, reflect
memorization of publicly available datasets rather than genuine generalization.
We discuss implications for evaluation protocols and propose strategies to
disentangle semantic leakage from authentic reasoning ability in future LLM
assessments.

TL;DR: FreeChunker是一个跨粒度编码框架，通过将句子作为原子单位，从静态分块转向支持任意句子组合的灵活检索，显著提升RAG系统的检索性能和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分块方法依赖静态边界识别，采用固定粒度范式，限制了其对多样化查询需求的适应性。

Method: 提出FreeChunker框架，将句子视为原子单位，从静态分块分割转向支持任意句子组合的灵活检索，减少语义边界检测的计算开销。

Result: 在LongBench V2上的实验评估显示，FreeChunker相比传统分块方法实现了更优的检索性能，同时在计算效率上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FreeChunker通过范式转换，不仅显著降低了语义边界检测的计算开销，还增强了对复杂查询的适应性，为RAG系统提供了更高效的分块策略。

Abstract: Chunking strategies significantly impact the effectiveness of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Existing methods operate within
fixed-granularity paradigms that rely on static boundary identification,
limiting their adaptability to diverse query requirements. This paper presents
FreeChunker, a Cross-Granularity Encoding Framework that fundamentally
transforms the traditional chunking paradigm: the framework treats sentences as
atomic units and shifts from static chunk segmentation to flexible retrieval
supporting arbitrary sentence combinations. This paradigm shift not only
significantly reduces the computational overhead required for semantic boundary
detection but also enhances adaptability to complex queries. Experimental
evaluation on LongBench V2 demonstrates that FreeChunker achieves superior
retrieval performance compared to traditional chunking methods, while
significantly outperforming existing approaches in computational efficiency.

Motivation: 探索专门使用对话数据进行预训练是否能够产生在形式和功能上都合适的小型语言模型，以及如何通过不同的微调策略来增强模型的对话生成能力。

Method: 基于预训练的llamalogue模型，采用多种微调策略（包括PPO和DPO）来强制模型生成更具交流性的文本。

Result: 模型在大多数标准BabyLM基准测试中表现不佳，但在最小对设置下的对话延续预测方面表现出色；PPO微调效果混合甚至负面，而DPO微调进一步提升了在自定义对话基准上的性能。

Abstract: We investigate whether pre-training exclusively on dialogue data results in

underperform on most standard BabyLM benchmarks, they excel at dialogue

paper, we set three important yet unanswered research questions and aim to
address them. To derive the answers, we investigate whether LLMs can recognize
contextual shifts caused by negation and still reliably distinguish
hallucinations comparable to affirmative cases. We also design the NegHalu
dataset by reconstructing existing hallucination detection datasets with
negated expressions. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs struggle to detect
hallucinations in negated text effectively, often producing logically
inconsistent or unfaithful judgments. Moreover, we trace the internal state of
LLMs as they process negated inputs at the token level and reveal the
challenges of mitigating their unintended effects.

*Shaltiel Shmidman,Avi Shmidman,Moshe Koppel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了NeoDictaBERT和NeoDictaBERT-bilingual两个BERT风格模型，专注于希伯来语文本处理，在希伯来语基准测试中表现优异，特别是在检索任务上超越同类多语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BERT模型虽然性能优秀但架构已过时，需要更新以匹配Llama3、Qwen3等新型transformer模型。ModernBERT和NeoBERT的成功表明改进是可行的，但缺乏专门针对希伯来语文本的优化模型。

Method: 采用与NeoBERT相同的架构训练BERT风格模型，专门针对希伯来语文本进行训练，开发了单语和双语两个版本。

Result: NeoDictaBERT模型在几乎所有希伯来语基准测试中都优于现有模型，NeoDictaBERT-bilingual在检索任务上表现尤其突出，超越了类似规模的多语言模型。

Conclusion: 这些模型为希伯来语NLP的下游任务提供了强大基础，已向社区发布以推动希伯来语NLP的研究和发展。

Abstract: Since their initial release, BERT models have demonstrated exceptional
performance on a variety of tasks, despite their relatively small size
(BERT-base has ~100M parameters). Nevertheless, the architectural choices used
in these models are outdated compared to newer transformer-based models such as
Llama3 and Qwen3. In recent months, several architectures have been proposed to
close this gap. ModernBERT and NeoBERT both show strong improvements on English
benchmarks and significantly extend the supported context window. Following
their successes, we introduce NeoDictaBERT and NeoDictaBERT-bilingual:
BERT-style models trained using the same architecture as NeoBERT, with a
dedicated focus on Hebrew texts. These models outperform existing ones on
almost all Hebrew benchmarks and provide a strong foundation for downstream
tasks. Notably, the NeoDictaBERT-bilingual model shows strong results on
retrieval tasks, outperforming other multilingual models of similar size. In
this paper, we describe the training process and report results across various
benchmarks. We release the models to the community as part of our goal to
advance research and development in Hebrew NLP.

TL;DR: ContingentChat是一个教师-学生框架，通过在100M词汇的BabyLM上进行后训练，提高多轮对话的连续性，使生成的回复更语法正确和连贯。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿童与照顾者之间的多轮对话具有连续性特征，即对话者之间及时、直接且有意义的交流。研究旨在改进BabyLM在多轮对话中的连续性表现。

Method: 使用新颖的对齐数据集进行后训练，采用教师-学生框架，并实验了自适应教师解码策略。

Result: BabyLM生成的回复在语法和连贯性方面有所改善，但自适应教师解码策略带来的额外增益有限。

Conclusion: ContingentChat展示了针对性后训练对对话质量的益处，同时表明连续性对于BabyLM来说仍然是一个具有挑战性的目标。

Abstract: Multi-turn dialogues between a child and a caregiver are characterized by a
property called contingency - that is, prompt, direct, and meaningful exchanges
between interlocutors. We introduce ContingentChat, a teacher-student framework
that benchmarks and improves multi-turn contingency in a BabyLM trained on 100M
words. Using a novel alignment dataset for post-training, BabyLM generates
responses that are more grammatical and cohesive. Experiments with adaptive
teacher decoding strategies show limited additional gains. ContingentChat
demonstrates the benefits of targeted post-training for dialogue quality and
indicates that contingency remains a challenging goal for BabyLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出指令蒸馏任务，将低质量指令数据转化为高质量指令-输出对，并开发LM-Mixup方法，通过监督微调和强化学习优化模型，显著提升指令调优效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指令调优对LLM对齐至关重要，但高质量数据稀缺而低质量数据丰富但常被丢弃。现有数据增强方法难以有效利用低质量数据，且评估标准不明确。

Method: 1. 定义指令蒸馏任务；2. 构建MIXTURE数据集（144K样本）；3. 开发LM-Mixup方法：先监督微调，再通过GRPO强化学习优化，使用质量、语义对齐和格式合规三个奖励信号。

Result: 仅使用约3%的蒸馏数据微调LLM，不仅超越全数据集训练，还能与最先进的高质量数据选择方法竞争，在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: 低质量数据经过适当蒸馏和LM-Mixup增强后是宝贵资源，能显著提升指令调优LLM的效率和性能。

Abstract: Instruction tuning is crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), yet
the quality of instruction-following data varies significantly. While
high-quality data is paramount, it is often scarce; conversely, abundant
low-quality data is frequently discarded, leading to substantial information
loss. Existing data augmentation methods struggle to augment this low-quality
data effectively, and the evaluation of such techniques remains poorly defined.
To address this, we formally define the task of Instruction Distillation:
distilling multiple low-quality and redundant inputs into high-quality and
coherent instruction-output pairs. Specifically, we introduce a comprehensive
data construction pipeline to create MIXTURE, a 144K-sample dataset pairing
low-quality or semantically redundant imperfect instruction clusters with their
high-quality distillations. We then introduce LM-Mixup, by first performing
supervised fine-tuning on MIXTURE and then optimizing it with reinforcement
learning. This process uses three complementary reward signals: quality,
semantic alignment, and format compliance, via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). We demonstrate that LM-Mixup effectively augments
imperfect datasets: fine-tuning LLMs on its distilled data, which accounts for
only about 3% of the entire dataset, not only surpasses full-dataset training
but also competes with state-of-the-art high-quality data selection methods
across multiple benchmarks. Our work establishes that low-quality data is a
valuable resource when properly distilled and augmented with LM-Mixup,
significantly enhancing the efficiency and performance of instruction-tuned
LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的输出具有不同程度的不确定性和正确性，其实际可靠性难以保证，需要量化这种不确定性。

Method: 在四个问答任务上使用最先进的开源LLM，系统评估四种置信度估计方法：VCE、MSP、样本一致性和CoCoA。

Result: 每种不确定性指标捕捉了模型置信度的不同方面，混合CoCoA方法在整体可靠性方面表现最佳，提高了校准和正确答案的区分度。

Conclusion: 讨论了各种方法的权衡，并为LLM应用中选择不确定性度量提供了建议。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce outputs with varying levels of
uncertainty, and, just as often, varying levels of correctness; making their
practical reliability far from guaranteed. To quantify this uncertainty, we
systematically evaluate four approaches for confidence estimation in LLM
outputs: VCE, MSP, Sample Consistency, and CoCoA (Vashurin et al., 2025). For
the evaluation of the approaches, we conduct experiments on four
question-answering tasks using a state-of-the-art open-source LLM. Our results
show that each uncertainty metric captures a different facet of model
confidence and that the hybrid CoCoA approach yields the best reliability
overall, improving both calibration and discrimination of correct answers. We
discuss the trade-offs of each method and provide recommendations for selecting
uncertainty measures in LLM applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现大语言模型的内部表征可作为学习知识的可靠代理，旨在解决持续学习中无需访问历史数据的问题，避免性能权衡和灾难性遗忘。

Method: 基于层间隐藏表征计算模型间相似度，对聚类典型样本进行自适应层次化参数融合，浅层保留领域通用特征，深层适应任务特定需求。

Result: 在五个NLP任务和多种持续学习场景下，RECALL在知识保留和泛化能力上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RECALL提供了一个可扩展且无需数据的解决方案，用于演进大语言模型，实现无缝多领域集成和强大的抗遗忘能力。

Abstract: We unveil that internal representations in large language models (LLMs) serve
as reliable proxies of learned knowledge, and propose RECALL, a novel
representation-aware model merging framework for continual learning without
access to historical data. RECALL computes inter-model similarity from
layer-wise hidden representations over clustered typical samples, and performs
adaptive, hierarchical parameter fusion to align knowledge across models. This
design enables the preservation of domain-general features in shallow layers
while allowing task-specific adaptation in deeper layers. Unlike prior methods
that require task labels or incur performance trade-offs, RECALL achieves
seamless multi-domain integration and strong resistance to catastrophic
forgetting. Extensive experiments across five NLP tasks and multiple continual
learning scenarios show that RECALL outperforms baselines in both knowledge
retention and generalization, providing a scalable and data-free solution for
evolving LLMs.

*Tim Tian Hua,Andrew Qin,Samuel Marks,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过向LLM的激活状态添加导向向量，可以抑制模型在评估时的警觉行为，使其表现得像在部署环境中一样，从而提高安全评估的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在评估时能够检测到被测试并调整行为以显得更对齐，这损害了安全评估的可靠性。

Method: 采用两阶段训练过程：首先在包含模型事实描述的文档上进行持续预训练，然后通过专家迭代训练模型在评估环境中使用Python类型提示。最后通过激活导向技术抑制评估警觉性。

Result: 训练后的模型在评估环境中比部署环境更频繁地使用类型提示，但通过激活导向可以消除这种差异，使模型在有评估线索时也表现得像在部署中。

Conclusion: 激活导向技术可以帮助AI评估者提高安全评估的可靠性，使模型在评估时表现得像在实际部署中一样。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes detect when they are being
evaluated and adjust their behavior to appear more aligned, compromising the
reliability of safety evaluations. In this paper, we show that adding a
steering vector to an LLM's activations can suppress evaluation-awareness and
make the model act like it is deployed during evaluation. To study our steering
technique, we train an LLM to exhibit evaluation-aware behavior using a
two-step training process designed to mimic how this behavior could emerge
naturally. First, we perform continued pretraining on documents with factual
descriptions of the model (1) using Python type hints during evaluation but not
during deployment and (2) recognizing that the presence of a certain evaluation
cue always means that it is being tested. Then, we train the model with expert
iteration to use Python type hints in evaluation settings. The resulting model
is evaluation-aware: it writes type hints in evaluation contexts more than
deployment contexts. However, this gap can only be observed by removing the
evaluation cue. We find that activation steering can suppress evaluation
awareness and make the model act like it is deployed even when the cue is
present. Importantly, we constructed our steering vector using the original
model before our additional training. Our results suggest that AI evaluators
could improve the reliability of safety evaluations by steering models to act
like they are deployed.

*Ruochen Mao,Yuling Shi,Xiaodong Gu,Jiaheng Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Robust Preference Selection (RPS)方法，通过方向性邻域共识来增强语言模型对多样化用户偏好的鲁棒性，无需重新训练即可提升模型在罕见偏好上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型倾向于在常见偏好上表现良好，但在偏离训练数据中心趋势的特定、个体化需求上表现不佳，存在偏好覆盖差距。现有方法需要昂贵的重新训练，且难以泛化到完整的多样化偏好谱系。

Method: RPS是一种后处理、无需训练的方法，利用方向性邻域共识。它从相关偏好的局部邻域中采样多个响应来创建候选池，然后选择与用户原始意图最对齐的响应。

Result: 在三种不同对齐范式(DPA、DPO、SFT)上的综合实验表明，RPS始终比基线方法更鲁棒，在空间欠表示区域的挑战性偏好上实现了高达69%的胜率，且无需模型重新训练。

Conclusion: RPS提供了一个实用、理论基础的解决方案，用于增强偏好对齐模型的可靠性，能够有效处理多样化用户偏好而无需重新训练。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human preferences is critical for
creating reliable and controllable AI systems. A human preference can be
visualized as a high-dimensional vector where different directions represent
trade-offs between desired attributes (e.g., helpfulness vs. verbosity). Yet,
because the training data often reflects dominant, average preferences, LLMs
tend to perform well on common requests but fall short in specific, individual
needs. This mismatch creates a preference coverage gap. Existing methods often
address this through costly retraining, which may not be generalized to the
full spectrum of diverse preferences. This brittleness means that when a user's
request reflects a nuanced preference deviating from the training data's
central tendency, model performance can degrade unpredictably. To address this
challenge, we introduce Robust Preference Selection (RPS), a post-hoc,
training-free method by leveraging directional neighborhood consensus. Instead
of forcing a model to generate a response from a single, highly specific
preference, RPS samples multiple responses from a local neighborhood of related
preferences to create a superior candidate pool. It then selects the response
that best aligns with the user's original intent. We provide a theoretical
framework showing our neighborhood generation strategy is provably superior to
a strong baseline that also samples multiple candidates. Comprehensive
experiments across three distinct alignment paradigms (DPA, DPO, and SFT)
demonstrate that RPS consistently improves robustness against this baseline,
achieving win rates of up to 69% on challenging preferences from
under-represented regions of the space without any model retraining. Our work
presents a practical, theoretically-grounded solution for enhancing the
reliability of preference-aligned models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前检索增强生成(RAG)在多步问题和异构证据源上的脆弱性，平衡准确性、延迟和token/工具预算之间的矛盾。

Method: 将异构数据线性化为可逆分层序列，使用头代理指导检索，迭代代理通过结构感知操作选择和扩展序列，最后合成规范化证据生成答案。

Result: 在HotpotQA、HybridQA/TAT-QA和MetaQA等数据集上相比单次检索、多跳和智能RAG基线，实现了EM/F1指标的持续提升，同时保持高效率。

Conclusion: HSEQ框架具有格式无关的统一性、预算感知的迭代和证据规范化三大优势，能够可靠地提升问答系统的一致性和可审计性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains brittle on multi-step questions
and heterogeneous evidence sources, trading accuracy against latency and
token/tool budgets. This paper introducesHierarchical Sequence (HSEQ) Iteration
for Heterogeneous Question Answering, a unified framework that (i) linearize
documents, tables, and knowledge graphs into a reversible hierarchical sequence
with lightweight structural tags, and (ii) perform structure-aware iteration to
collect just-enough evidence before answer synthesis. A Head Agent provides
guidance that leads retrieval, while an Iteration Agent selects and expands
HSeq via structure-respecting actions (e.g., parent/child hops, table
row/column neighbors, KG relations); Finally the head agent composes
canonicalized evidence to genearte the final answer, with an optional
refinement loop to resolve detected contradictions. Experiments on HotpotQA
(text), HybridQA/TAT-QA (table+text), and MetaQA (KG) show consistent EM/F1
gains over strong single-pass, multi-hop, and agentic RAG baselines with high
efficiency. Besides, HSEQ exhibits three key advantages: (1) a format-agnostic
unification that enables a single policy to operate across text, tables, and
KGs without per-dataset specialization; (2) guided, budget-aware iteration that
reduces unnecessary hops, tool calls, and tokens while preserving accuracy; and
(3) evidence canonicalization for reliable QA, improving answers consistency
and auditability.

Conclusion: 多语言翻译公平性框架能有效揭示LLM的政治偏见，主流政党在翻译中享有特权地位

Abstract: The political biases of Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually assessed by
simulating their answers to English surveys. In this work, we propose an
alternative framing of political biases, relying on principles of fairness in
multilingual translation. We systematically compare the translation quality of
speeches in the European Parliament (EP), observing systematic differences with
majority parties from left, center, and right being better translated than
outsider parties. This study is made possible by a new, 21-way multiparallel
version of EuroParl, the parliamentary proceedings of the EP, which includes
the political affiliations of each speaker. The dataset consists of 1.5M
sentences for a total of 40M words and 249M characters. It covers three years,
1000+ speakers, 7 countries, 12 EU parties, 25 EU committees, and hundreds of

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为ARC-Encoder的上下文压缩编码器，可将文本压缩为更少的连续表示，从而减少LLM的推理成本，同时保持性能并实现跨多个解码器的通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决检索增强生成和思维链推理等技术导致的上下文变长和推理成本增加问题，同时避免现有压缩方法需要微调目标模型或修改架构所带来的通用能力下降问题。

Method: 设计了一种名为ARC-Encoder的自适应文本表示压缩器，通过系统研究训练策略和架构选择，将上下文压缩为比文本标记更少的连续表示（通常减少4-8倍），这些表示可替代解码器LLM中的标记嵌入。

Result: ARC-Encoder在多个LLM使用场景（从上下文学习到上下文窗口扩展）中实现了最先进的性能，同时提高了推理计算效率，并能适应多个解码器同时使用。

Conclusion: ARC-Encoder提供了一个灵活高效的便携式编码器解决方案，可与多个LLM无缝协作，是上下文压缩的有效方法。

Abstract: Recent techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation or chain-of-thought
reasoning have led to longer contexts and increased inference costs. Context
compression techniques can reduce these costs, but the most effective
approaches require fine-tuning the target model or even modifying its
architecture. This can degrade its general abilities when not used for this
specific purpose. Here we explore an alternative approach: an encoder that
compresses the context into continuous representations which replace token
embeddings in decoder LLMs. First, we perform a systematic study of training
strategies and architecture choices for the encoder. Our findings led to the
design of an Adaptable text Representations Compressor, named ARC-Encoder,
which outputs $x$-times fewer continuous representations (typically
$x\!\in\!\{4,8\}$) than text tokens. We evaluate ARC-Encoder across a variety
of LLM usage scenarios, ranging from in-context learning to context window
extension, on both instruct and base decoders. Results show that ARC-Encoder
achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks while improving
computational efficiency at inference. Finally, we demonstrate that our models
can be adapted to multiple decoders simultaneously, allowing a single encoder
to generalize across different decoder LLMs. This makes ARC-Encoder a flexible
and efficient solution for portable encoders that work seamlessly with multiple
LLMs. We release a training code at https://github.com/kyutai-labs/ARC-Encoder

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CenterBench是一个包含9,720个中心嵌套句理解问题的数据集，用于区分语言模型的结构理解与语义模式匹配能力，通过对比语义合理与不合理句子来量化模型何时放弃结构分析转向语义关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法区分语言模型是真正分析语法结构还是仅依赖语义模式匹配，需要开发能明确区分这两种能力的评估方法。

Method: 创建CenterBench数据集，包含中心嵌套句及其语义不合理对应句，通过6个理解问题测试表面理解、句法依赖和因果推理，测试6个模型在复杂度递增时的表现差异。

Result: 模型在合理与不合理句子间的性能差距随复杂度系统性扩大（中位数差距达26.8个百分点），语义合理性在因果推理问题中反而损害性能，推理模型虽提高准确性但存在语义捷径、过度思考和答案拒绝等问题。

Conclusion: CenterBench提供了首个识别模型何时从结构分析转向模式匹配的框架，揭示了模型与人类在语义效应上的差异，为评估语言模型的真正结构理解能力提供了新工具。

Abstract: When language models correctly parse "The cat that the dog chased meowed,"
are they analyzing syntax or simply familiar with dogs chasing cats? Despite
extensive benchmarking, we lack methods to distinguish structural understanding
from semantic pattern matching. We introduce CenterBench, a dataset of 9,720
comprehension questions on center-embedded sentences (like "The cat [that the
dog chased] meowed") where relative clauses nest recursively, creating
processing demands from simple to deeply nested structures. Each sentence has a
syntactically identical but semantically implausible counterpart (e.g., mailmen
prescribe medicine, doctors deliver mail) and six comprehension questions
testing surface understanding, syntactic dependencies, and causal reasoning.
Testing six models reveals that performance gaps between plausible and
implausible sentences widen systematically with complexity, with models showing
median gaps up to 26.8 percentage points, quantifying when they abandon
structural analysis for semantic associations. Notably, semantic plausibility
harms performance on questions about resulting actions, where following causal
relationships matters more than semantic coherence. Reasoning models improve
accuracy but their traces show semantic shortcuts, overthinking, and answer
refusal. Unlike models whose plausibility advantage systematically widens with
complexity, humans shows variable semantic effects. CenterBench provides the
first framework to identify when models shift from structural analysis to
pattern matching.

TL;DR: GlobalRAG是一个强化学习框架，通过分解问题为子目标、协调检索与推理、迭代优化证据来解决多跳问答中的全局规划缺失和不可靠执行问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在多跳问答中存在两个基本限制：(i) 缺乏全局规划来构建多步推理结构；(ii) 不可靠的执行，阻碍了有效的查询制定和检索证据的一致使用。

Method: 提出GlobalRAG框架，将问题分解为子目标，协调检索与推理，迭代优化证据。引入规划质量奖励和子目标完成奖励来指导过程，并使用渐进权重退火策略平衡过程导向和结果导向目标。

Result: 在领域内和领域外基准测试中，GlobalRAG显著优于强基线方法，仅使用8k训练数据（基线方法的42%），在EM和F1指标上平均提升14.2%。

Conclusion: GlobalRAG通过强化学习有效增强了多跳问答中的全局推理能力，在减少训练数据需求的同时显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently shown promise in improving
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite these advances, its effectiveness
in multi-hop question answering (QA) remains limited by two fundamental
limitations: (i) global planning absence to structure multi-step reasoning, and
(ii) unfaithful execution, which hinders effective query formulation and
consistent use of retrieved evidence. We propose GlobalRAG, a reinforcement
learning framework designed to enhance global reasoning in multi-hop QA.
GlobalRAG decomposes questions into subgoals, coordinates retrieval with
reasoning, and refines evidence iteratively. To guide this process, we
introduce Planning Quality Reward and SubGoal Completion Reward, which
encourage coherent planning and reliable subgoal execution. In addition, a
progressive weight annealing strategy balances process-oriented and
outcome-based objectives. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and
out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that GlobalRAG significantly outperforms
strong baselines while using only 8k training data (42% of the training data
used by strong baselines), achieving average improvements of 14.2% in both EM
and F1.

*Zhouwei Zhai,Mengxiang Chen,Haoyun Xia,Jin Li,Renquan Zhou,Min Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出多智能体认知决策框架(MACDF)，将电商搜索从被动检索转变为主动决策支持，解决传统检索排序范式与用户多阶段认知决策过程不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索排序范式依赖查询-商品匹配，与平台用户的多阶段认知决策过程存在根本性不匹配，导致语义鸿沟、高决策成本和缺乏专业购物指导等关键限制。

Method: 设计多智能体认知决策框架(MACDF)，通过多智能体系统主动提供决策支持，而非被动检索。

Result: 离线评估显示MACDF在推荐准确性和用户满意度方面显著提升，特别适用于包含否定、多约束或推理需求的复杂查询。在JD搜索平台的在线A/B测试证实了其实际效果。

Conclusion: 这项工作突显了多智能体认知系统在重新定义电商搜索方面的变革潜力。

Abstract: The retrieval-ranking paradigm has long dominated e-commerce search, but its
reliance on query-item matching fundamentally misaligns with multi-stage
cognitive decision processes of platform users. This misalignment introduces
critical limitations: semantic gaps in complex queries, high decision costs due
to cross-platform information foraging, and the absence of professional
shopping guidance. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Agent Cognitive
Decision Framework (MACDF), which shifts the paradigm from passive retrieval to
proactive decision support. Extensive offline evaluations demonstrate MACDF's
significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction,
particularly for complex queries involving negation, multi-constraint, or
reasoning demands. Online A/B testing on JD search platform confirms its
practical efficacy. This work highlights the transformative potential of
multi-agent cognitive systems in redefining e-commerce search.

*Jiangang Hao,Wenju Cui,Patrick Kyllonen,Emily Kerzabi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究调查了ChatGPT在沟通数据自动编码中是否存在性别和种族偏见，发现没有显著偏见，为大规模协作评估铺平道路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然ChatGPT能直接根据编码规则对沟通数据进行编码，但尚不清楚其编码是否存在针对不同人口群体（如性别和种族）的偏见。

Method: 使用典型的协作问题解决编码框架，分析三种协作任务（谈判、问题解决和决策制定）的数据，检验ChatGPT编码在性别和种族群体间的差异。

Result: 结果显示ChatGPT基础的编码在性别和种族群体间没有显著偏见。

Conclusion: ChatGPT基础的编码无显著人口群体偏见，为大规模协作和沟通评估的采用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Assessing communication and collaboration at scale depends on a labor
intensive task of coding communication data into categories according to
different frameworks. Prior research has established that ChatGPT can be
directly instructed with coding rubrics to code the communication data and
achieves accuracy comparable to human raters. However, whether the coding from
ChatGPT or similar AI technology exhibits bias against different demographic
groups, such as gender and race, remains unclear. To fill this gap, this paper
investigates ChatGPT-based automated coding of communication data using a
typical coding framework for collaborative problem solving, examining
differences across gender and racial groups. The analysis draws on data from
three types of collaborative tasks: negotiation, problem solving, and decision
making. Our results show that ChatGPT-based coding exhibits no significant bias
across gender and racial groups, paving the road for its adoption in
large-scale assessment of collaboration and communication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究基于人类好奇心评估问卷5DCR，构建了评估LLMs好奇心的框架，发现LLMs比人类有更强的求知欲但在不确定环境中更保守，且好奇心能增强模型的推理和主动学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型是否具备类似人类的好奇心驱动学习能力，这是理解LLMs认知能力的重要方面。

Method: 基于人类好奇心评估问卷Five-Dimensional Curiosity scale Revised (5DCR)，设计了涵盖信息寻求、刺激寻求、社会好奇心等维度的综合评估框架。

Result: LLMs表现出比人类更强的知识渴求，但在面对不确定环境时倾向于保守选择；好奇心行为能增强模型的推理和主动学习能力。

Conclusion: LLMs具有展现类似人类好奇心的潜力，为未来LLMs学习能力和创新研究的发展提供了实验支持。

Abstract: Curiosity serves as a pivotal conduit for human beings to discover and learn
new knowledge. Recent advancements of large language models (LLMs) in natural
language processing have sparked discussions regarding whether these models
possess capability of curiosity-driven learning akin to humans. In this paper,
starting from the human curiosity assessment questionnaire Five-Dimensional
Curiosity scale Revised (5DCR), we design a comprehensive evaluation framework
that covers dimensions such as Information Seeking, Thrill Seeking, and Social
Curiosity to assess the extent of curiosity exhibited by LLMs. The results
demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a stronger thirst for knowledge than humans but
still tend to make conservative choices when faced with uncertain environments.
We further investigated the relationship between curiosity and thinking of
LLMs, confirming that curious behaviors can enhance the model's reasoning and
active learning abilities. These findings suggest that LLMs have the potential
to exhibit curiosity similar to that of humans, providing experimental support
for the future development of learning capabilities and innovative research in
LLMs.

TL;DR: LRMs在非英语问题上倾向于用英语推理，导致翻译错误和性能下降，特别是在复杂任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LRMs的多语言推理能力，关注其在非英语问题上的表现和翻译错误问题。

Method: 在MGSM和GPQA Diamond任务上系统比较LRM的英语推理与问题语言推理，分析推理轨迹中的认知属性。

Result: 英语推理轨迹显示更多认知行为，英语推理通常获得更高准确率，但存在翻译错误导致的失败模式。

Conclusion: LRMs的多语言推理能力有限，英语优先策略在复杂任务中易产生翻译错误，需要改进多语言推理方法。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance on mathematical,
scientific, and other question-answering tasks, but their multilingual
reasoning abilities remain underexplored. When presented with non-English
questions, LRMs often default to reasoning in English, raising concerns about
interpretability and the handling of linguistic and cultural nuances. We
systematically compare an LRM's reasoning in English versus the language of the
question. Our evaluation spans two tasks: MGSM and GPQA Diamond. Beyond
measuring answer accuracy, we also analyze cognitive attributes in the
reasoning traces. We find that English reasoning traces exhibit a substantially
higher presence of these cognitive behaviors, and that reasoning in English
generally yields higher final-answer accuracy, with the performance gap
increasing as tasks become more complex. However, this English-centric strategy
is susceptible to a key failure mode - getting "Lost in Translation," where
translation steps lead to errors that would have been avoided by question's
language reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了CantoNLU基准测试，涵盖粤语自然语言理解的7个任务，评估了多种模型性能，发现粤语适应模型整体表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决粤语因政策和双语现象导致的资源匮乏问题，缺乏评估框架。

Method: 创建CantoNLU基准测试，包含7个任务；评估四种模型：未训练粤语的普通话模型、通过持续预训练获得的粤语适应模型、从头训练的粤语单语模型。

Result: 粤语适应模型整体表现最佳，单语模型在句法任务上表现更好，普通话模型在某些场景下仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: 当粤语领域数据稀缺时，直接迁移可能足够；发布了所有数据集、代码和模型权重以促进粤语NLP研究。

Abstract: Cantonese, although spoken by millions, remains under-resourced due to policy
and diglossia. To address this scarcity of evaluation frameworks for Cantonese,
we introduce \textsc{\textbf{CantoNLU}}, a benchmark for Cantonese natural
language understanding (NLU). This novel benchmark spans seven tasks covering
syntax and semantics, including word sense disambiguation, linguistic
acceptability judgment, language detection, natural language inference,
sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing. In addition
to the benchmark, we provide model baseline performance across a set of models:
a Mandarin model without Cantonese training, two Cantonese-adapted models
obtained by continual pre-training a Mandarin model on Cantonese text, and a
monolingual Cantonese model trained from scratch. Results show that
Cantonese-adapted models perform best overall, while monolingual models perform
better on syntactic tasks. Mandarin models remain competitive in certain
settings, indicating that direct transfer may be sufficient when Cantonese
domain data is scarce. We release all datasets, code, and model weights to
facilitate future research in Cantonese NLP.

TL;DR: 提出神经多样性作为减少语言模型幻觉的新机制，通过解相关的并行表示来降低幻觉率，而不增加参数或数据量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在参数、计算和数据不断增加的情况下仍然存在幻觉问题，需要寻找新的解决方案

Method: 提出ND-LoRA方法，结合并行LoRA适配器和Barlow Twins正则化，通过降低表示相关性来增加神经多样性

Result: ND-LoRA将幻觉率降低高达25.6%（平均14.6%），且不降低整体准确率；神经相关性增加0.1%会导致幻觉增加3.8%

Conclusion: 神经多样性是继参数和数据之后的第三个扩展维度，可以在固定预算下提高语言模型的可靠性

Abstract: Language models continue to hallucinate despite increases in parameters,
compute, and data. We propose neural diversity -- decorrelated parallel
representations -- as a principled mechanism that reduces hallucination rates
at fixed parameter and data budgets. Inspired by portfolio theory, where
uncorrelated assets reduce risk by $\sqrt{P}$, we prove hallucination
probability is bounded by representational correlation: $P(H) \leq
f(\sigma^2((1-\rho(P))/P + \rho(P)), \mu^2)$, which predicts that language
models need an optimal amount of neurodiversity. To validate this, we introduce
ND-LoRA (Neural Diversity Low-Rank Adaptation), combining parallel LoRA
adapters with Barlow Twins regularization, and demonstrate that ND-LoRA reduces
hallucinations by up to 25.6% (and 14.6% on average) without degrading general
accuracy. Ablations show LoRA adapters and regularization act synergistically,
causal interventions prove neurodiversity as the mediating factor and
correlational analyses indicate scale: a 0.1% neural correlation increase is
associated with a 3.8% hallucination increase. Finally, task-dependent
optimality emerges: different tasks require different amounts of optimal
neurodiversity. Together, our results highlight neural diversity as a third
axis of scaling -- orthogonal to parameters and data -- to improve the
reliability of language models at fixed budgets.

TL;DR: 该论文针对MBR解码在开放任务中的局限性，提出了三种轻量级适配方法，通过增强对结果空间结构变化的敏感性来提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MBR解码在机器翻译中表现良好，但在对话或指令跟随等开放任务中可能失效，因为标准相似性效用函数会选择模型分布中广泛代表性的响应，但可能忽略具有潜在结构的分组。

Method: 提出了三种轻量级效用函数适配方法，使MBR对结果空间的结构变化更敏感；构建了包含对话行为、情感和响应结构的数据集；提出了两个评估结构最优性的指标。

Result: 分析显示标准相似性效用函数在结构最优性指标上表现不佳，而提出的适配方法显著改善了结构最优性；在真实指令跟随基准测试中，结构敏感性提升使生成质量提高了13.7个百分点。

Conclusion: 增强MBR对结构变化的敏感性可以有效提升在开放任务中的生成质量，提出的轻量级适配方法在实际应用中表现优异。

Abstract: Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding has seen renewed interest as an alternative
to traditional generation strategies. While MBR has proven effective in machine
translation, where the variability of a language model's outcome space is
naturally constrained, it may face challenges in more open-ended tasks such as
dialogue or instruction-following. We hypothesise that in such settings,
applying MBR with standard similarity-based utility functions may result in
selecting responses that are broadly representative of the model's
distribution, yet sub-optimal with respect to any particular grouping of
generations that share an underlying latent structure. In this work, we
introduce three lightweight adaptations to the utility function, designed to
make MBR more sensitive to structural variability in the outcome space. To test
our hypothesis, we curate a dataset capturing three representative types of
latent structure: dialogue act, emotion, and response structure (e.g., a
sentence, a paragraph, or a list). We further propose two metrics to evaluate
the structural optimality of MBR. Our analysis demonstrates that common
similarity-based utility functions fall short by these metrics. In contrast,
our proposed adaptations considerably improve structural optimality. Finally,
we evaluate our approaches on real-world instruction-following benchmarks,
AlpacaEval and MT-Bench, and show that increased structural sensitivity
improves generation quality by up to 13.7 percentage points in win rate.

*Xiaoyuan Wu,Roshni Kaushik,Wenkai Li,Lujo Bauer,Koichi Onoue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现用户对LLM在隐私敏感场景下的响应隐私保护质量和帮助性评价存在很大差异，而代理LLM与用户评价相关性很低，表明隐私和帮助性评价具有高度个体特异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究依赖代理LLM评估隐私规范遵从性，忽视了真实用户的感知，且主要关注隐私保护质量而未研究帮助性的细微差异。

Method: 对94名参与者使用PrivacyLens的90个场景进行用户研究，比较用户与5个代理LLM对相同LLM响应的评价。

Result: 用户对相同响应的隐私保护质量和帮助性评价一致性低，而代理LLM之间一致性高但与用户评价相关性低。

Conclusion: LLM响应的隐私和帮助性具有个体特异性，代理LLM无法准确估计用户感知，需要进行以用户为中心的研究来改进评估方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid adoption for tasks such as
drafting emails, summarizing meetings, and answering health questions. In such
uses, users may need to share private information (e.g., health records,
contact details). To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such private
information, prior work developed benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) with
real-life scenarios. Using these benchmarks, researchers have found that LLMs
sometimes fail to keep secrets private when responding to complex tasks (e.g.,
leaking employee salaries in meeting summaries). However, these evaluations
rely on LLMs (proxy LLMs) to gauge compliance with privacy norms, overlooking
real users' perceptions. Moreover, prior work primarily focused on the
privacy-preservation quality of responses, without investigating nuanced
differences in helpfulness. To understand how users perceive the
privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of LLM responses to
privacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study with 94 participants
using 90 scenarios from PrivacyLens. We found that, when evaluating identical
responses to the same scenario, users showed low agreement with each other on
the privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of the LLM response. Further,
we found high agreement among five proxy LLMs, while each individual LLM had
low correlation with users' evaluations. These results indicate that the
privacy and helpfulness of LLM responses are often specific to individuals, and
proxy LLMs are poor estimates of how real users would perceive these responses
in privacy-sensitive scenarios. Our results suggest the need to conduct
user-centered studies on measuring LLMs' ability to help users while preserving
privacy. Additionally, future research could investigate ways to improve the
alignment between proxy LLMs and users for better estimation of users'
perceived privacy and utility.

TL;DR: 开发并评估了多种NLP方法从临床笔记中提取氟嘧啶治疗和毒性信息，发现基于大语言模型的错误分析提示方法表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 氟嘧啶广泛用于结直肠癌和乳腺癌治疗，但会引起手足综合征和心脏毒性等副作用，这些信息通常嵌入在临床笔记中，需要自动化提取方法。

Method: 构建了包含236份临床笔记的金标准数据集，开发了基于规则、机器学习、深度学习和LLM的NLP方法，使用80:20的训练测试分割。

Result: 错误分析提示方法在治疗和毒性提取上达到最优性能（F1=1.000），零样本提示方法在治疗提取上F1=1.000，毒性提取上F1=0.876。机器学习方法排名第二，深度学习方法表现较差。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的NLP方法最有效地从临床笔记中提取氟嘧啶治疗和毒性信息，在肿瘤学研究和药物警戒方面具有强大潜力。

Abstract: Objective: Fluoropyrimidines are widely prescribed for colorectal and breast
cancers, but are associated with toxicities such as hand-foot syndrome and
cardiotoxicity. Since toxicity documentation is often embedded in clinical
notes, we aimed to develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP)
methods to extract treatment and toxicity information.
  Materials and Methods: We constructed a gold-standard dataset of 236 clinical
notes from 204,165 adult oncology patients. Domain experts annotated categories
related to treatment regimens and toxicities. We developed rule-based, machine
learning-based (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine [SVM], Logistic
Regression [LR]), deep learning-based (BERT, ClinicalBERT), and large language
models (LLM)-based NLP approaches (zero-shot and error-analysis prompting).
Models used an 80:20 train-test split.
  Results: Sufficient data existed to train and evaluate 5 annotated
categories. Error-analysis prompting achieved optimal precision, recall, and F1
scores (F1=1.000) for treatment and toxicities extraction, whereas zero-shot
prompting reached F1=1.000 for treatment and F1=0.876 for toxicities
extraction.LR and SVM ranked second for toxicities (F1=0.937). Deep learning
underperformed, with BERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1= 0.839 toxicities) and
ClinicalBERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1 = 0.886 toxicities). Rule-based methods
served as our baseline with F1 scores of 0.857 in treatment and 0.858 in
toxicities.
  Discussion: LMM-based approaches outperformed all others, followed by machine
learning methods. Machine and deep learning approaches were limited by small
training data and showed limited generalizability, particularly for rare
categories.
  Conclusion: LLM-based NLP most effectively extracted fluoropyrimidine
treatment and toxicity information from clinical notes, and has strong
potential to support oncology research and pharmacovigilance.

Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂任务中通过中间"思考"过程提升推理能力，但其在机器翻译质量评估方面的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出校准LRM思维的方法，通过训练合成的人类思维轨迹来优化模型评估过程。

Result: 在WMT24 Metrics基准测试中，该方法大幅降低思考预算约35倍，同时在不同规模的LRM（7B到32B）上提升评估性能，如R1-Distill-Qwen-7B获得+8.7相关性点提升。

Conclusion: 经过有效校准的大型推理模型具有推进细粒度自动机器翻译评估的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have introduced an
intermediate "thinking" process prior to generating final answers, improving
their reasoning capabilities on complex downstream tasks. However, the
potential of LRMs as evaluators for machine translation (MT) quality remains
underexplored. We provides the first systematic analysis of LRM-as-a-judge in
MT evaluation. We identify key challenges, revealing LRMs require tailored
evaluation materials, tend to "overthink" simpler instances and have issues
with scoring mechanisms leading to overestimation. To address these, we propose
to calibrate LRM thinking by training them on synthetic, human-like thinking
trajectories. Our experiments on WMT24 Metrics benchmarks demonstrate that this
approach largely reduces thinking budgets by ~35x while concurrently improving
evaluation performance across different LRM scales from 7B to 32B (e.g.,
R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves a +8.7 correlation point improvement). These
findings highlight the potential of efficiently calibrated LRMs to advance
fine-grained automatic MT evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM评估方法主要关注文本生成等高级任务，没有针对特定AI应用，无法充分评估公平性等负责任AI维度，因为不同应用中受保护属性的相关性不同。

Method: 构建基于真实应用（根据产品特征生成纯文本产品描述）的数据集，参数化公平性属性与性别化形容词和产品类别的交叉，生成带标签的提示集。

Result: 展示了如何使用该数据识别LLM在质量、真实性、安全性和公平性方面的差距。

Conclusion: 为研究社区贡献了LLM评估提案和具体资源，强调评估应与具体应用场景相结合。

Abstract: Current methods for evaluating large language models (LLMs) typically focus
on high-level tasks such as text generation, without targeting a particular AI
application. This approach is not sufficient for evaluating LLMs for
Responsible AI dimensions like fairness, since protected attributes that are
highly relevant in one application may be less relevant in another. In this
work, we construct a dataset that is driven by a real-world application
(generate a plain-text product description, given a list of product features),
parameterized by fairness attributes intersected with gendered adjectives and
product categories, yielding a rich set of labeled prompts. We show how to use
the data to identify quality, veracity, safety, and fairness gaps in LLMs,
contributing a proposal for LLM evaluation paired with a concrete resource for
the research community.

Motivation: 线性注意力模型虽然效率高，但有限的记忆容量会导致遗忘问题，影响检索密集型任务的表现。需要找到在保持效率的同时增强记忆能力的方法。

Method: 提出混合模型，结合线性注意力和稀疏注意力。包括：1）带token淘汰的稀疏注意力；2）查询感知的本地稀疏注意力；3）可学习的token淘汰方法，使用轻量级CNN结合滑动窗口注意力自适应保留关键KV对。

Result: 在检索密集型基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，提供了高效的Triton内核实现稀疏注意力机制。

Conclusion: 通过混合注意力机制，在保持线性注意力效率优势的同时，有效缓解了遗忘问题，提升了模型在检索密集型任务上的表现。

Abstract: Linear-attention models that compress the entire input sequence into a
fixed-size recurrent state offer an efficient alternative to Transformers, but
their finite memory induces forgetfulness that harms retrieval-intensive tasks.
To mitigate the issue, we explore a series of hybrid models that restore direct
access to past tokens. We interleave token mixers with intermediate time and
space complexity between linear and full attention, including sparse attention
with token eviction, and the query-aware native sparse attention. Particularly,
we propose a novel learnable token eviction approach. Combined with
sliding-window attention, an end-to-end trainable lightweight CNN aggregates
information from both past and future adjacent tokens to adaptively retain a
limited set of critical KV-pairs per head, maintaining linear attention's
constant time and space complexity. Efficient Triton kernels for the sparse
attention mechanisms are provided. Empirical evaluations on retrieval-intensive
benchmarks support the effectiveness of our approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了降低在检索增强生成中使用长上下文的计算成本，需要开发高效的软上下文压缩方法，将长输入序列转换为更短的连续表示。

Method: 开发了轻量级的均值池化方法，并研究训练同一个压缩器输出多个压缩比，与广泛使用的压缩标记架构进行对比。

Result: 简单的均值池化方法在所有实验中表现最强，在训练多个压缩比时性能下降相对较小。不同架构和训练机制之间的权衡更加复杂。

Conclusion: 均值池化方法在软上下文压缩中表现最佳，但压缩方法的整体格局比预期更加复杂，需要更细致的研究。

Abstract: A common strategy to reduce the computational costs of using long contexts in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) is soft
context compression, where the input sequence is transformed into a shorter
continuous representation. We develop a lightweight and simple mean-pooling
approach that consistently outperforms the widely used compression-tokens
architecture, and study training the same compressor to output multiple
compression ratios. We conduct extensive experiments across in-domain and
out-of-domain QA datasets, as well as across model families, scales, and
compression ratios. Overall, our simple mean-pooling approach achieves the
strongest performance, with a relatively small drop when training for multiple
compression ratios. More broadly though, across architectures and training
regimes the trade-offs are more nuanced, illustrating the complex landscape of
compression methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛应用，检测其生成文本的需求日益增长，但缺乏对"LLM生成文本"的统一定义，且实际应用中存在人机界限模糊的问题，导致现有检测方法效果有限。

Method: 通过分析LLM生成文本检测面临的挑战，包括定义不明确、使用场景差异、模型多样性、人类编辑影响等，批判现有基准和评估方法的不足。

Result: 研究发现现有检测器在真实世界应用中的数值结果常被误解，其重要性正在减弱，检测器仅在特定条件下有效。

Conclusion: LLM生成文本检测器在特定条件下仍有用，但检测结果应仅作为参考而非决定性指标，需要更全面的评估框架。

Abstract: With the widespread use of large language models (LLMs), many researchers

is no consistent or precise definition of their target, namely "LLM-generated

increase the difficulty of detection. What is commonly regarded as the
detecting target usually represents only a subset of the text that LLMs can
potentially produce. Human edits to LLM outputs, together with the subtle
influences that LLMs exert on their users, are blurring the line between
LLM-generated and human-written text. Existing benchmarks and evaluation
approaches do not adequately address the various conditions in real-world
detector applications. Hence, the numerical results of detectors are often
misunderstood, and their significance is diminishing. Therefore, detectors
remain useful under specific conditions, but their results should be
interpreted only as references rather than decisive indicators.

### [150] [Some Attention is All You Need for Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19861)
*Felix Michalak,Steven Abreu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在混合SSM-Transformer架构中，检索功能完全由自注意力层负责，SSM层无法补偿注意力层的缺失。仅保留15%的注意力头就能维持近乎完美的检索性能，同时保留84%的MMLU表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究混合SSM-Transformer架构中不同组件的功能特化，特别是自注意力层在检索任务中的关键作用。

Method: 通过注意力消融实验和注意力头稀疏化实验，分析RecurrentGemma-2B/9B和Jamba-Mini-1.6模型中自注意力层与SSM层的功能分工。

Result: 注意力消融导致检索任务完全失败（0%准确率），而SSM层没有补偿机制。仅保留15%注意力头就能维持近乎完美的检索性能。

Conclusion: 混合架构中存在严格的功能特化，自注意力层专门负责检索任务，这些模型更像是专门模块而非集成系统，对架构优化和可解释性有重要影响。

Abstract: We demonstrate complete functional segregation in hybrid SSM-Transformer
architectures: retrieval depends exclusively on self-attention layers. Across
RecurrentGemma-2B/9B and Jamba-Mini-1.6, attention ablation causes catastrophic
retrieval failure (0% accuracy), while SSM layers show no compensatory
mechanisms even with improved prompting. Conversely, sparsifying attention to
just 15% of heads maintains near-perfect retrieval while preserving 84% MMLU
performance, suggesting self-attention specializes primarily for retrieval
tasks. We identify precise mechanistic requirements for retrieval: needle
tokens must be exposed during generation and sufficient context must be
available during prefill or generation. This strict functional specialization
challenges assumptions about redundancy in hybrid architectures and suggests
these models operate as specialized modules rather than integrated systems,
with immediate implications for architecture optimization and interpretability.

TL;DR: NAS-DQN通过在线神经架构搜索控制器实现动态网络重构，在深度强化学习中超越固定架构设计，获得更好的最终性能、样本效率和策略稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度强化学习代理的性能受限于固定的神经网络架构，需要通过昂贵的超参数搜索确定，这限制了代理的潜在性能。

Method: 引入NAS-DQN代理，将学习到的神经架构搜索控制器直接集成到DRL训练循环中，基于累积性能反馈实现动态网络重构。

Result: NAS-DQN在连续控制任务中优于三个固定架构基线和随机搜索控制，实现了更优的最终性能、样本效率和策略稳定性，且计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 架构自适应对于在线深度强化学习的最优样本效率不仅是有益的，而且是必要的，RL代理的设计可以无缝集成为学习过程的动态组件。

Abstract: The performance of deep reinforcement learning agents is fundamentally
constrained by their neural network architecture, a choice traditionally made
through expensive hyperparameter searches and then fixed throughout training.
This work investigates whether online, adaptive architecture optimization can
escape this constraint and outperform static designs. We introduce NAS-DQN, an
agent that integrates a learned neural architecture search controller directly
into the DRL training loop, enabling dynamic network reconfiguration based on
cumulative performance feedback. We evaluate NAS-DQN against three
fixed-architecture baselines and a random search control on a continuous
control task, conducting experiments over multiple random seeds. Our results
demonstrate that NAS-DQN achieves superior final performance, sample
efficiency, and policy stability while incurring negligible computational
overhead. Critically, the learned search strategy substantially outperforms
both undirected random architecture exploration and poorly-chosen fixed
designs, indicating that intelligent, performance-guided search is the key
mechanism driving success. These findings establish that architecture
adaptation is not merely beneficial but necessary for optimal sample efficiency
in online deep reinforcement learning, and suggest that the design of RL agents
need not be a static offline choice but can instead be seamlessly integrated as
a dynamic component of the learning process itself.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReGraphT是一个无需训练、基于检索增强生成的框架，通过构建CUDA优化轨迹的推理图，将大语言模型的推理能力转移到小模型上，使小模型在CUDA代码生成任务中接近大模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前使用大语言模型生成优化CUDA代码面临代码泄露风险和计算成本高的问题，而小模型虽然轻量且隐私友好，但在复杂CUDA生成任务中推理能力有限导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出ReGraphT框架：将CUDA优化轨迹组织成结构化推理图，将组合优化建模为状态转换，利用蒙特卡洛图搜索进行高效探索。

Result: ReGraphT在CUDAEval和ParEval基准测试上平均实现2.33倍加速，优于HPC专用微调模型和其他检索增强方法，使小模型接近大模型性能。

Conclusion: ReGraphT成功地将大语言模型的推理能力转移到小模型，解决了隐私风险和计算开销问题，为高效CUDA代码生成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Despite significant evolution of CUDA programming and domain-specific
libraries, effectively utilizing GPUs with massively parallel engines remains
difficult. Large language models (LLMs) show strong potential in generating
optimized CUDA code from sequential code. However, using LLMs in practice faces
two major challenges: cloud-based APIs pose risks of code leakage, and local
deployment is often computationally expensive and inefficient. These drawbacks
have spurred interest in small language models (SLMs), which are more
lightweight and privacy-friendly. Encouragingly, recent studies show that SLMs
can achieve performance comparable to LLMs on specific tasks. While SLMs can
match LLMs on domain-specific tasks, their limited reasoning abilities lead to
suboptimal performance in complex CUDA generation according to our experiments.
To bridge this gap, we propose ReGraphT, a training-free, retrieval-augmented
generation framework that transfers LLM-level reasoning to smaller models.
ReGraphT organizes CUDA optimization trajectories into a structured reasoning
graph, modeling the combined CUDA optimizations as state transitions, and
leverages Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. We also
present a CUDA-specific benchmark with difficulty tiers defined by reasoning
complexity to evaluate models more comprehensively. Experiments show that
ReGraphT outperforms HPC-specific fine-tuned models and other
retrieval-augmented approaches, achieving an average 2.33X speedup on CUDAEval
and ParEval. When paired with DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct and
Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct, ReGraphT enables SLMs to approach LLM-level
performance without the associated privacy risks or excessive computing
overhead.

TL;DR: 提出基于Transformer架构的深度学习模型，直接预测均衡路径流量，大幅降低计算时间，适应需求变化和网络结构调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统交通分配问题在大规模网络中计算复杂度非线性增长，计算成本过高，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用深度神经网络，特别是Transformer架构，直接预测均衡路径流量，捕捉OD对之间的复杂相关性。

Result: 在多个网络上测试，比传统优化方法快几个数量级，计算成本降低，预测精度提高，能灵活适应需求变化。

Conclusion: 该模型为交通管理和政策制定提供了快速"假设分析"能力，支持增强的交通规划和决策。

Abstract: The traffic assignment problem is essential for traffic flow analysis,
traditionally solved using mathematical programs under the Equilibrium
principle. These methods become computationally prohibitive for large-scale
networks due to non-linear growth in complexity with the number of OD pairs.
This study introduces a novel data-driven approach using deep neural networks,
specifically leveraging the Transformer architecture, to predict equilibrium
path flows directly. By focusing on path-level traffic distribution, the
proposed model captures intricate correlations between OD pairs, offering a
more detailed and flexible analysis compared to traditional link-level
approaches. The Transformer-based model drastically reduces computation time,
while adapting to changes in demand and network structure without the need for
recalculation. Numerical experiments are conducted on the Manhattan-like
synthetic network, the Sioux Falls network, and the Eastern-Massachusetts
network. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is orders of magnitude
faster than conventional optimization. It efficiently estimates path-level
traffic flows in multi-class networks, reducing computational costs and
improving prediction accuracy by capturing detailed trip and flow information.
The model also adapts flexibly to varying demand and network conditions,
supporting traffic management and enabling rapid `what-if' analyses for
enhanced transportation planning and policy-making.

TL;DR: 提出了FairGRPO方法，通过分层强化学习解决医疗AI系统中的公平性问题，减少不同人口群体间的性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗AI系统在诊断能力上表现出色，但在不同人口群体间存在显著的性能差异，这对代表性不足的群体造成实际伤害。现有的多模态推理基础模型通过强化学习训练时，会继承并放大训练数据中的偏见。

Method: FairGRPO是一种分层强化学习方法，采用基于代表性、任务难度和数据来源的自适应重要性加权。当缺乏人口统计标签时，使用无监督聚类自动发现潜在的人口群体。

Result: 在7个临床诊断数据集上的实验表明，FairGRPO将预测均等性提高了27.2%，同时F1分数提升了12.49%。训练动态分析显示FairGRPO在优化过程中持续改善公平性。

Conclusion: FairGRPO有效解决了医疗AI中的公平性问题，并发布了FairMedGemma-4B模型，在保持最先进性能的同时显著减少了人口群体间的差异。

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence systems have achieved remarkable diagnostic
capabilities, yet they consistently exhibit performance disparities across
demographic groups, causing real-world harm to underrepresented populations.
While recent multimodal reasoning foundation models have advanced clinical
diagnosis through integrated analysis of diverse medical data, reasoning
trainings via reinforcement learning inherit and often amplify biases present
in training datasets dominated by majority populations. We introduce
Fairness-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (FairGRPO), a hierarchical
reinforcement learning approach that promotes equitable learning across
heterogeneous clinical populations. FairGRPO employs adaptive importance
weighting of advantages based on representation, task difficulty, and data
source. To address the common issue of missing demographic labels in the
clinical domain, we further employ unsupervised clustering, which automatically
discovers latent demographic groups when labels are unavailable. Through
comprehensive experiments across 7 clinical diagnostic datasets spanning 5
clinical modalities across X-ray, CT scan, dermoscropy, mammography and
ultrasound, we demonstrate that FairGRPO reduces predictive parity by 27.2%
against all vanilla and bias mitigated RL baselines, while improving F1 score
by 12.49%. Furthermore, training dynamics analysis reveals that FairGRPO
progressively improves fairness throughout optimization, while baseline RL
methods exhibit deteriorating fairness as training progresses. Based on
FairGRPO, we release FairMedGemma-4B, a fairness-aware clinical VLLM that
achieves state-of-the-art performance while demonstrating significantly reduced
disparities across demographic groups.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发更透明、可靠和高效的临床决策支持系统，优化泌尿系统疾病的筛查和早期诊断，特别是膀胱癌。

Method: 使用SHAP进行特征选择，采用XGBoost、LightGBM和CatBoost算法，通过Optuna进行超参数优化，使用SMOTE技术平衡类别，构建六个二元分类场景区分膀胱癌与其他泌尿系统疾病。

Result: SHAP特征选择在保持或提升平衡准确率、精确度和特异性等性能指标的同时，增强了模型的可解释性。

Conclusion: 基于可解释性技术（SHAP）的特征选择是有效的方法，有助于开发更透明、可靠和高效的临床决策支持系统。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach to support the diagnosis of urinary
tract diseases, with a focus on bladder cancer, using SHAP (SHapley Additive
exPlanations)-based feature selection to enhance the transparency and
effectiveness of predictive models. Six binary classification scenarios were
developed to distinguish bladder cancer from other urological and oncological
conditions. The algorithms XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost were employed, with
hyperparameter optimization performed using Optuna and class balancing with the
SMOTE technique. The selection of predictive variables was guided by importance
values through SHAP-based feature selection while maintaining or even improving
performance metrics such as balanced accuracy, precision, and specificity. The
use of explainability techniques (SHAP) for feature selection proved to be an
effective approach. The proposed methodology may contribute to the development
of more transparent, reliable, and efficient clinical decision support systems,
optimizing screening and early diagnosis of urinary tract diseases.

TL;DR: FINDER是一个针对噪声数据集的分类框架，通过随机特征和Kosambi-Karhunen-Loève展开来分解数据中的随机性，在数据稀缺的科学领域实现先进分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理噪声数据集（低信噪比、小样本量、数据收集错误等）是分类方法的重要研究前沿，具有理论和实践意义。

Method: 将经验数据集视为随机场的实现，映射到适当的希尔伯特空间，通过KLE分解将随机特征分解为可计算的不可约分量，通过特征分解进行噪声数据集分类。

Result: 在阿尔茨海默病分期分类和遥感森林砍伐检测等数据稀缺的科学领域取得了最先进的突破性成果。

Conclusion: 讨论了FINDER优于现有方法的情况、失效模式和其他限制。

Abstract: ''Noisy'' datasets (regimes with low signal to noise ratios, small sample
sizes, faulty data collection, etc) remain a key research frontier for
classification methods with both theoretical and practical implications. We
introduce FINDER, a rigorous framework for analyzing generic classification
problems, with tailored algorithms for noisy datasets. FINDER incorporates
fundamental stochastic analysis ideas into the feature learning and inference
stages to optimally account for the randomness inherent to all empirical
datasets. We construct ''stochastic features'' by first viewing empirical
datasets as realizations from an underlying random field (without assumptions
on its exact distribution) and then mapping them to appropriate Hilbert spaces.
The Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo\'eve expansion (KLE) breaks these stochastic features
into computable irreducible components, which allow classification over noisy
datasets via an eigen-decomposition: data from different classes resides in
distinct regions, identified by analyzing the spectrum of the associated
operators. We validate FINDER on several challenging, data-deficient scientific
domains, producing state of the art breakthroughs in: (i) Alzheimer's Disease
stage classification, (ii) Remote sensing detection of deforestation. We end
with a discussion on when FINDER is expected to outperform existing methods,
its failure modes, and other limitations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次分析了Muon优化器中非精确正交化更新的理论性能，揭示了近似精度与最优步长和动量参数之间的耦合关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器在实践中依赖快速近似正交化，但现有理论分析都基于计算不可行的精确SVD更新，存在理论与实践脱节的问题。

Method: 在线性最小化oracle框架下，引入加性误差模型来捕捉实际近似方案的非精确性，分析非精确正交化更新的性能边界。

Result: 分析表明：较低oracle精度需要更小的步长但更大的动量参数，近似精度成为必须与学习调度共同调优的关键参数。NanoGPT实验证实了这种耦合关系。

Conclusion: 将近似过程从实现细节提升为关键参数，必须与学习率调度共同调优，为实际Muon优化器的理论理解提供了基础。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer has rapidly emerged as a powerful, geometry-aware
alternative to AdamW, demonstrating strong performance in large-scale training
of neural networks. However, a critical theory-practice disconnect exists:
Muon's efficiency relies on fast, approximate orthogonalization, yet all prior
theoretical work analyzes an idealized, computationally intractable version
assuming exact SVD-based updates. This work moves beyond the ideal by providing
the first analysis of the inexact orthogonalized update at Muon's core. We
develop our analysis within the general framework of Linear Minimization Oracle
(LMO)-based optimization, introducing a realistic additive error model to
capture the inexactness of practical approximation schemes. Our analysis yields
explicit bounds that quantify performance degradation as a function of the LMO
inexactness/error. We reveal a fundamental coupling between this inexactness
and the optimal step size and momentum: lower oracle precision requires a
smaller step size but larger momentum parameter. These findings elevate the
approximation procedure (e.g., the number of Newton-Schulz steps) from an
implementation detail to a critical parameter that must be co-tuned with the
learning schedule. NanoGPT experiments directly confirm the predicted coupling,
with optimal learning rates clearly shifting as approximation precision
changes.

TL;DR: 本文针对去中心化联邦学习中的隐私预算量化问题，提出了两种基于f-差分隐私的隐私核算方法：PN-f-DP和Sec-f-LDP，能够更准确地捕捉稀疏通信、本地迭代和相关性噪声带来的隐私放大效应。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化联邦学习中的隐私预算量化具有挑战性，因为存在复杂的算法组件如去中心化通信和本地更新。现有方法难以准确量化这些设置下的隐私泄露。

Method: 开发了两种新的f-DP核算方法：PN-f-DP量化随机游走通信下用户对之间的隐私泄露，Sec-f-LDP通过共享秘密支持结构化噪声注入。结合f-DP理论和马尔可夫链集中度工具。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，相比基于Rényi DP的方法，本文方法能产生更紧的(ε,δ)边界和更好的效用。

Conclusion: f-DP在去中心化隐私核算中具有优势，能够更准确地捕捉隐私放大效应，为去中心化联邦学习提供更精确的隐私保护保证。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) decentralized Federated Learning (FL) allows
local users to collaborate without sharing their data with a central server.
However, accurately quantifying the privacy budget of private FL algorithms is
challenging due to the co-existence of complex algorithmic components such as
decentralized communication and local updates. This paper addresses privacy
accounting for two decentralized FL algorithms within the $f$-differential
privacy ($f$-DP) framework. We develop two new $f$-DP-based accounting methods
tailored to decentralized settings: Pairwise Network $f$-DP (PN-$f$-DP), which
quantifies privacy leakage between user pairs under random-walk communication,
and Secret-based $f$-Local DP (Sec-$f$-LDP), which supports structured noise
injection via shared secrets. By combining tools from $f$-DP theory and Markov
chain concentration, our accounting framework captures privacy amplification
arising from sparse communication, local iterations, and correlated noise.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our methods yield
consistently tighter $(\epsilon,\delta)$ bounds and improved utility compared
to R\'enyi DP-based approaches, illustrating the benefits of $f$-DP in
decentralized privacy accounting.

TL;DR: 本文分析了持续学习中任务排序对线性回归的影响，重点关注贪心最大化任务间差异性的排序策略，并与随机排序进行比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究任务排序在持续学习中的影响，特别是贪心最大化任务差异性的排序策略，这在先前工作中虽有提及但仍存在许多未解问题。

Method: 使用Kaczmarz方法文献中的工具，形式化贪心排序策略，并发展几何和代数直觉。在线性回归和CIFAR-100分类任务上进行实证分析。

Result: 实证表明贪心排序在平均损失收敛速度上优于随机排序。理论上，在高秩回归设置中，贪心排序与随机排序有相似的损失界，但在一般秩情况下，允许重复的贪心排序收敛速度为O(1/³√k)，而单次贪心排序可能失败。

Conclusion: 揭示了贪心和随机排序策略内部及之间的细微差别，表明任务排序策略在持续学习中具有重要影响。

Abstract: We analyze task orderings in continual learning for linear regression,
assuming joint realizability of training data. We focus on orderings that
greedily maximize dissimilarity between consecutive tasks, a concept briefly
explored in prior work but still surrounded by open questions. Using tools from
the Kaczmarz method literature, we formalize such orderings and develop
geometric and algebraic intuitions around them. Empirically, we demonstrate
that greedy orderings converge faster than random ones in terms of the average
loss across tasks, both for linear regression with random data and for linear
probing on CIFAR-100 classification tasks. Analytically, in a high-rank
regression setting, we prove a loss bound for greedy orderings analogous to
that of random ones. However, under general rank, we establish a
repetition-dependent separation. Specifically, while prior work showed that for
random orderings, with or without replacement, the average loss after $k$
iterations is bounded by $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$, we prove that single-pass
greedy orderings may fail catastrophically, whereas those allowing repetition
converge at rate $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt[3]{k})$. Overall, we reveal nuances
within and between greedy and random orderings.

Result: 在单资产和多资产交易任务中，该方法获得更高的夏普比率，并在交易量增加时保持稳健性。

Conclusion: 该方法为金融市场中的强化学习提供了更忠实和可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: In financial applications, reinforcement learning (RL) agents are commonly
trained on historical data, where their actions do not influence prices.
However, during deployment, these agents trade in live markets where their own
transactions can shift asset prices, a phenomenon known as market impact. This
mismatch between training and deployment environments can significantly degrade
performance. Traditional robust RL approaches address this model
misspecification by optimizing the worst-case performance over a set of
uncertainties, but typically rely on symmetric structures that fail to capture
the directional nature of market impact. To address this issue, we develop a
novel class of elliptic uncertainty sets. We establish both implicit and
explicit closed-form solutions for the worst-case uncertainty under these sets,
enabling efficient and tractable robust policy evaluation. Experiments on
single-asset and multi-asset trading tasks demonstrate that our method achieves
superior Sharpe ratio and remains robust under increasing trade volumes,
offering a more faithful and scalable approach to RL in financial markets.

Conclusion: 提出的无偏梯度估计器家族成功解决了零阶优化中的偏差问题，在理论和实验上都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) is an important framework for stochastic
optimization when gradients are unavailable or expensive to compute. A
potential limitation of existing ZOO methods is the bias inherent in most
gradient estimators unless the perturbation stepsize vanishes. In this paper,
we overcome this biasedness issue by proposing a novel family of unbiased
gradient estimators based solely on function evaluations. By reformulating
directional derivatives as a telescoping series and sampling from carefully
designed distributions, we construct estimators that eliminate bias while
maintaining favorable variance. We analyze their theoretical properties, derive
optimal scaling distributions and perturbation stepsizes of four specific
constructions, and prove that SGD using the proposed estimators achieves
optimal complexity for smooth non-convex objectives. Experiments on synthetic
tasks and language model fine-tuning confirm the superior accuracy and
convergence of our approach compared to standard methods.

TL;DR: 本文研究两点零阶梯度估计器，发现当扰动步长趋于零时，最小化估计器渐近方差的扰动分布可以与真实梯度方向对齐，而非固定长度。提出了方向对齐扰动(DAP)方案，在理论和实证上都优于传统方法。

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注固定长度扰动，而忽略了方向对齐的潜在优势。本文旨在探索能够与真实梯度方向对齐的扰动分布，以提高梯度估计的准确性。

Method: 将问题表述为扰动分布空间上的约束函数优化问题，提出方向对齐扰动(DAP)方案，该方案自适应地在关键方向上提供更高精度。同时分析了使用δ-无偏随机扰动的随机梯度下降收敛性。

Result: 理论分析表明DAP方案在特定条件下优于传统方法。在合成问题和实际任务上的实证评估验证了DAPs的性能优势。

Conclusion: 方向对齐扰动方案通过自适应地在关键方向提供更高精度，能够有效提高梯度估计的准确性，扩展了现有复杂度界限到更广泛的扰动类型。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the two-point zeroth-order gradient estimator and
identify the distribution of random perturbations that minimizes the
estimator's asymptotic variance as the perturbation stepsize tends to zero. We
formulate it as a constrained functional optimization problem over the space of
perturbation distributions. Our findings reveal that such desired perturbations
can align directionally with the true gradient, instead of maintaining a fixed
length. While existing research has largely focused on fixed-length
perturbations, the potential advantages of directional alignment have been
overlooked. To address this gap, we delve into the theoretical and empirical
properties of the directionally aligned perturbation (DAP) scheme, which
adaptively offers higher accuracy along critical directions. Additionally, we
provide a convergence analysis for stochastic gradient descent using
$\delta$-unbiased random perturbations, extending existing complexity bounds to
a wider range of perturbations. Through empirical evaluations on both synthetic
problems and practical tasks, we demonstrate that DAPs outperform traditional
methods under specific conditions.

Abstract: Recent research has focused on mitigating algorithmic bias in clustering by
incorporating fairness constraints into algorithmic design. Notions such as
disparate impact, community cohesion, and cost per population have been
implemented to enforce equitable outcomes. Among these, group fairness
(balance) ensures that each protected group is proportionally represented
within every cluster. However, incorporating balance as a metric of fairness
into spectral clustering algorithms has led to computational times that can be
improved. This study aims to enhance the efficiency of spectral clustering
algorithms by reformulating the constrained optimization problem using a new
formulation derived from the Lagrangian method and the
Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury (SMW) identity, resulting in the Fair-SMW algorithm.
Fair-SMW employs three alternatives to the Laplacian matrix with different
spectral gaps to generate multiple variations of Fair-SMW, achieving clustering
solutions with comparable balance to existing algorithms while offering
improved runtime performance. We present the results of Fair-SMW, evaluated
using the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) to measure both runtime efficiency and
balance across real-world network datasets, including LastFM, FacebookNet,
Deezer, and German. We achieve an improvement in computation time that is twice
as fast as the state-of-the-art, and also flexible enough to achieve twice as
much balance.

### [164] [Towards Strong Certified Defense with Universal Asymmetric Randomization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19977)
*Hanbin Hong,Ashish Kundu,Ali Payani,Binghui Wang,Yuan Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UCAN提出了一种使用各向异性噪声的通用认证对抗鲁棒性方法，显著提升了现有随机平滑方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前随机平滑方法主要使用各向同性噪声分布，忽略了输入和数据维度的异质性，限制了鲁棒性认证的有效性。

Method: UCAN将现有随机平滑方法从对称（各向同性）噪声分布转换为非对称（各向异性）噪声分布，通过三个噪声参数生成器优化不同数据维度的噪声参数。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR10和ImageNet数据集上，UCAN在大认证半径下的认证准确率比现有最先进方法提升了高达182.6%。

Conclusion: UCAN通过各向异性噪声显著提升了对抗鲁棒性认证的性能，为机器学习模型提供了更有效的防御机制。

Abstract: Randomized smoothing has become essential for achieving certified adversarial
robustness in machine learning models. However, current methods primarily use
isotropic noise distributions that are uniform across all data dimensions, such
as image pixels, limiting the effectiveness of robustness certification by
ignoring the heterogeneity of inputs and data dimensions. To address this
limitation, we propose UCAN: a novel technique that \underline{U}niversally
\underline{C}ertifies adversarial robustness with \underline{A}nisotropic
\underline{N}oise. UCAN is designed to enhance any existing randomized
smoothing method, transforming it from symmetric (isotropic) to asymmetric
(anisotropic) noise distributions, thereby offering a more tailored defense
against adversarial attacks. Our theoretical framework is versatile, supporting
a wide array of noise distributions for certified robustness in different
$\ell_p$-norms and applicable to any arbitrary classifier by guaranteeing the
classifier's prediction over perturbed inputs with provable robustness bounds
through tailored noise injection. Additionally, we develop a novel framework
equipped with three exemplary noise parameter generators (NPGs) to optimally
fine-tune the anisotropic noise parameters for different data dimensions,
allowing for pursuing different levels of robustness enhancements in
practice.Empirical evaluations underscore the significant leap in UCAN's
performance over existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating up to
$182.6\%$ improvement in certified accuracy at large certified radii on MNIST,
CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.\footnote{Code is anonymously available at

*Renzhao Liang,Sizhe Xu,Chenggang Xie,Jingru Chen,Feiyang Ren,Shu Yang,Takahiro Yabe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究挑战了时间序列预测中的"长序列信息增益假设"，发现适当截断历史数据反而能提高预测精度，提出了基于信息瓶颈理论的AMRC方法，通过动态掩码损失和表示一致性约束来抑制冗余特征学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列预测模型基于"长序列信息增益假设"，但该研究发现现有模型在训练中会学习大量冗余特征（如噪声或不相关波动），从而影响有效信号提取，需要新的方法来提升预测效率。

Method: 提出AMRC方法，包含两个核心组件：1）动态掩码损失，自适应识别高判别性时间片段来指导模型训练；2）表示一致性约束，稳定输入、标签和预测之间的映射关系。

Result: 实验结果表明AMRC有效抑制了冗余特征学习，同时显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作不仅挑战了时间建模中的传统假设，还为开发高效鲁棒的预测模型提供了新的理论见解和方法突破。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in critical domains such as
energy management and financial markets. Although deep learning-based
approaches (e.g., MLP, RNN, Transformer) have achieved remarkable progress, the
prevailing "long-sequence information gain hypothesis" exhibits inherent
limitations. Through systematic experimentation, this study reveals a
counterintuitive phenomenon: appropriately truncating historical data can
paradoxically enhance prediction accuracy, indicating that existing models
learn substantial redundant features (e.g., noise or irrelevant fluctuations)
during training, thereby compromising effective signal extraction. Building
upon information bottleneck theory, we propose an innovative solution termed
Adaptive Masking Loss with Representation Consistency (AMRC), which features
two core components: 1) Dynamic masking loss, which adaptively identified
highly discriminative temporal segments to guide gradient descent during model
training; 2) Representation consistency constraint, which stabilized the
mapping relationships among inputs, labels, and predictions. Experimental
results demonstrate that AMRC effectively suppresses redundant feature learning
while significantly improving model performance. This work not only challenges
conventional assumptions in temporal modeling but also provides novel
theoretical insights and methodological breakthroughs for developing efficient
and robust forecasting models.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了推理即填充和多重标记熵解码两种方法，充分利用掩码扩散语言模型的训练特性，在数学和编程任务中实现了更好的推理性能和数据生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对掩码扩散语言模型在数学和编程任务中表现不佳的问题，研究如何充分利用其训练特性来提升推理性能和数据生成能力。

Method: 提出推理即填充方法，通过填充推理模板来结构化输出；提出多重标记熵解码，基于条件熵的自适应并行解码方法。

Result: 在GSM8k上，使用后验推理轨迹微调模型性能与人工编写推理轨迹相当；多重标记熵解码保持性能的同时减少2.7倍解码步骤。

Conclusion: 掩码扩散语言模型的训练和计算特性为推理和后训练方法开辟了新途径，证明了其独特价值。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) are trained to in-fill positions in
randomly masked sequences, in contrast to next-token prediction models.
Discussions around MDLMs focus on two benefits: (1) any-order decoding and 2)
multi-token decoding. However, we observe that for math and coding tasks,
any-order algorithms often underperform or behave similarly to left-to-right
sampling, and standard multi-token decoding significantly degrades performance.
At inference time, MDLMs compute the conditional distribution of all masked
positions. A natural question is: How can we justify this additional compute
when left-to-right one-token-at-a-time decoding is on par with any-order
decoding algorithms? First, we propose reasoning-as-infilling. By using MDLMs
to infill a reasoning template, we can structure outputs and distinguish
between reasoning and answer tokens. In turn, this enables measuring answer
uncertainty during reasoning, and early exits when the model converges on an
answer. Next, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling enables sampling from the
MDLM posterior over reasoning traces conditioned on the answer, providing a new
source of high-quality data for post-training. On GSM8k, we observe that
fine-tuning LLaDA-8B Base on its posterior reasoning traces provides a
performance boost on par with fine-tuning on human-written reasoning traces.
Additionally, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling provides a method for
scoring the correctness of the reasoning process at intermediate steps. Second,
we propose multi-token entropy decoding (MED), a simple adaptive sampler that
minimizes the error incurred by decoding positions in parallel based on the
conditional entropies of those positions. MED preserves performance across
benchmarks and leads to 2.7x fewer steps. Our work demonstrates that the
training and compute used by MDLMs unlock many new inference and post-training
methods.

TL;DR: 使用监督学习和决策树分类器，在CAD建模的平面图中基于RSSI数据进行RFID位置推断，用于国防资产存储的异常检测和错放监控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RFID跟踪是国防资产存储的可行方案，但传感器特异性差（易受远程检测、欺骗和伪造攻击）会导致错误检测和操作安全事件。

Method: 在CAD建模的平面图中使用监督学习模拟，基于真实RSSI数据和决策树分类，对12个实验室区域进行位置推断，使用类别权重处理类别不平衡问题。

Result: 模型在5000个平衡观测值上训练，总体准确率为34.2%，多个区域（F、G、H等）的F1分数超过0.40，但稀有类别（特别是LabZoneC）经常被错误分类。

Conclusion: 基于RSSI的决策树可在现实模拟中实现区域级异常检测，但在低覆盖和低信号区域的可靠分类性能可通过更好的天线布局、额外传感器和多模态传感器融合来改进。

Abstract: Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tracking may be a viable solution for
defense assets that must be stored in accordance with security guidelines.
However, poor sensor specificity (vulnerabilities include long range detection,
spoofing, and counterfeiting) can lead to erroneous detection and operational
security events. We present a supervised learning simulation with realistic
Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) data and Decision Tree classification
in a Computer Assisted Design (CAD)-modeled floor plan that encapsulates some
of the challenges encountered in defense storage. In this work, we focused on
classifying 12 lab zones (LabZoneA-L) to perform location inference. The raw
dataset had approximately 980,000 reads. Class frequencies were imbalanced, and
class weights were calculated to account for class imbalance in this
multi-class setting. The model, trained on stratified subsamples to 5,000
balanced observations, yielded an overall accuracy of 34.2% and F1-scores
greater than 0.40 for multiple zones (Zones F, G, H, etc.). However, rare
classes (most notably LabZoneC) were often misclassified, even with the use of
class weights. An adjacency-aware confusion matrix was calculated to allow
better interpretation of physically adjacent zones. These results suggest that
RSSI-based decision trees can be applied in realistic simulations to enable
zone-level anomaly detection or misplacement monitoring for defense supply
logistics. Reliable classification performance in low-coverage and low-signal
zones could be improved with better antenna placement or additional sensors and
sensor fusion with other modalities.

TL;DR: 提出了SALT框架，通过构建轨迹图来提供更细粒度的优势分配，解决基于群体的强化学习算法中稀疏奖励导致的训练不稳定问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂多步任务中表现不佳，现有基于群体的强化学习方法使用稀疏结果奖励，导致训练不稳定和次优策略

Method: 构建相同提示下的轨迹图，量化每个步骤的质量并相应分配优势，作为即插即用模块与现有群体RL算法集成

Result: 在WebShop、ALFWorld和AppWorld基准测试中，SALT在不同模型规模下均能持续提升性能

Conclusion: SALT框架有效解决了群体RL算法中的奖励分配问题，提供了一种轻量级且高效的解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities,
enabling language agents to excel at single-turn tasks. However, their
application to complex, multi-step, and long-horizon tasks remains challenging.
While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising avenue for addressing
these challenges, mainstream approaches typically rely solely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, a limitation that becomes especially problematic for
group-based RL algorithms lacking critic models, such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). In such methods, uniformly rewarding or penalizing all
actions within a trajectory can lead to training instability and suboptimal
policies, because beneficial and detrimental actions are often entangled across
multi-step interactions. To address this challenge, we propose SALT, a novel
and lightweight framework that provides a finer-grained advantage assignment,
derived solely from outcome rewards. We achieve this by constructing a graph
from trajectories of the same prompt, which allows us to quantify the quality
of each step and assign advantages accordingly. Crucially, SALT is designed as
a plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates with existing group-based RL
algorithms, requiring no modifications to the rollout procedure and introducing
negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the WebShop,
ALFWorld, and AppWorld benchmarks with various model sizes demonstrate that
SALT consistently improves performance. We also conduct a thorough analysis to
validate the design choices behind SALT and offer actionable insights.

Abstract: Since its 2009 genesis block, the Bitcoin network has processed \num{>1.08}
billion (B) transactions representing \num{>8.72}B BTC, offering rich potential
for machine learning (ML); yet, its pseudonymity and obscured flow of funds
inherent in its \utxo-based design, have rendered this data largely
inaccessible for ML research. Addressing this gap, we present an ML-compatible
graph modeling the Bitcoin's economic topology by reconstructing the flow of
funds. This temporal, heterogeneous graph encompasses complete transaction
history up to block \cutoffHeight, consisting of \num{>2.4}B nodes and
\num{>39.72}B edges. Additionally, we provide custom sampling methods yielding
node and edge feature vectors of sampled communities, tools to load and analyze
the Bitcoin graph data within specialized graph databases, and ready-to-use
database snapshots. This comprehensive dataset and toolkit empower the ML
community to tackle Bitcoin's intricate ecosystem at scale, driving progress in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间点过程模型的采样是顺序进行的，限制了效率。需要解决表达性建模与高效并行生成之间的差距。

Method: 基于拒绝采样的算法，允许从现有TPP模型中并行采样多个未来事件值。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上实现了经验性加速，同时提供理论保证。

Conclusion: 该方法弥合了表达性建模与大规模TPP应用高效并行生成之间的差距。

Abstract: Temporal point processes are powerful generative models for event sequences
that capture complex dependencies in time-series data. They are commonly
specified using autoregressive models that learn the distribution of the next
event from the previous events. This makes sampling inherently sequential,
limiting efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on
rejection sampling that enables exact sampling of multiple future values from
existing TPP models, in parallel, and without requiring any architectural
changes or retraining. Besides theoretical guarantees, our method demonstrates
empirical speedups on real-world datasets, bridging the gap between expressive
modeling and efficient parallel generation for large-scale TPP applications.

Motivation: 在线广告平台需要有效的竞价策略来最大化利润，但现有研究往往未能同时考虑广告的延迟长期效应、累积影响（如强化或疲劳效应）以及客户异质性这三个关键因素。

Method: 将广告竞价建模为具有延迟泊松奖励的上下文马尔可夫决策过程，提出两阶段最大似然估计器结合数据分割策略，并在此基础上设计强化学习算法来制定个性化竞价策略。

Result: 该方法达到了$\tilde{O}{(dH^2\sqrt{T})}$的近最优遗憾界，其中$d$是上下文维度，$H$是轮数，$T$是客户数量。理论结果通过仿真实验得到验证。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效处理广告竞价中的延迟效应、累积影响和客户异质性，为在线广告平台提供了理论保证的个性化竞价策略。

Abstract: Online advertising platforms use automated auctions to connect advertisers
with potential customers, requiring effective bidding strategies to maximize
profits. Accurate ad impact estimation requires considering three key factors:
delayed and long-term effects, cumulative ad impacts such as reinforcement or
fatigue, and customer heterogeneity. However, these effects are often not
jointly addressed in previous studies. To capture these factors, we model ad
bidding as a Contextual Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with delayed Poisson
rewards. For efficient estimation, we propose a two-stage maximum likelihood
estimator combined with data-splitting strategies, ensuring controlled
estimation error based on the first-stage estimator's (in)accuracy. Building on
this, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm to derive efficient
personalized bidding strategies. This approach achieves a near-optimal regret
bound of $\tilde{O}{(dH^2\sqrt{T})}$, where $d$ is the contextual dimension,
$H$ is the number of rounds, and $T$ is the number of customers. Our
theoretical findings are validated by simulation experiments.

Conclusion: 该方法在需要长推理链的领域特别有效，能大幅降低计算和延迟开销

Abstract: Speculative decoding is widely used in accelerating large language model
(LLM) inference. In this work, we focus on the online draft model selection
problem in speculative decoding. We design an algorithm that provably competes
with the best draft model in hindsight for each query in terms of either the
token acceptance probability or expected acceptance length. In particular, we
show that we can accurately evaluate all draft models, instead of only the
chosen model without incurring additional queries to the target model, which
allows us to improve exponentially over the existing bandit-based approach as
the number of draft models increases. Our approach is generically applicable
with any speculative decoding methods (single draft, multi-drafts and
draft-trees). Moreover, we design system-efficient versions of online learners
and demonstrate that the overhead in computation and latency can be
substantially reduced. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source LLMs and
diverse datasets, demonstrating that our methods substantially outperform the
state-of-the-art EAGLE3 and the BanditSpec baseline in a variety of domains
where specialized domain-expert drafters are available, especially when long
reasoning chains are required.

Motivation: 探索加密货币市场中核心资产的流动性和波动性指标是否会产生溢出效应，从而能够预测整个市场的风险水平。

Method: 采用三层统计框架：核心流动性与收益率的交互作用、主成分关系、波动性因子投影，并结合VAR模型、HAR-X模型和防泄漏机器学习协议。

Result: 使用2021-2025年74种资产的1462个日度数据，发现各层之间存在统计显著的格兰杰因果关系，样本外预测准确性中等。

Conclusion: 核心加密货币的流动性和波动性指标确实能够预测市场整体风险，为风险管理提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: We study whether liquidity and volatility proxies of a core set of
cryptoassets generate spillovers that forecast market-wide risk. Our empirical
framework integrates three statistical layers: (A) interactions between core
liquidity and returns, (B) principal-component relations linking liquidity and
returns, and (C) volatility-factor projections that capture cross-sectional
volatility crowding. The analysis is complemented by vector autoregression
impulse responses and forecast error variance decompositions (see Granger 1969;
Sims 1980), heterogeneous autoregressive models with exogenous regressors
(HAR-X, Corsi 2009), and a leakage-safe machine learning protocol using
temporal splits, early stopping, validation-only thresholding, and SHAP-based
interpretation. Using daily data from 2021 to 2025 (1462 observations across 74
assets), we document statistically significant Granger-causal relationships
across layers and moderate out-of-sample predictive accuracy. We report the
most informative figures, including the pipeline overview, Layer A heatmap,
Layer C robustness analysis, vector autoregression variance decompositions, and
the test-set precision-recall curve. Full data and figure outputs are provided

Motivation: 现有方法要么忽略神经活动的时间结构，要么局限于单脑区、线性假设，或无法分离共享与私有信号。需要一种能同时处理非平稳非线性动态和信号分离的统一框架。

Method: 使用Transformer编码器-解码器架构捕获长程神经动态，将每个脑区的潜在空间明确划分为正交的共享和私有子空间。

Result: 在两个高密度电生理数据集（运动皮层和感觉区域）上验证，CTAE提取的表征能更好地解码行为变量，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CTAE提供了一个统一的框架，能有效分离多脑区神经记录中的共享和私有动态信号，并提高行为解码性能。

Abstract: Simultaneous recordings from thousands of neurons across multiple brain areas
reveal rich mixtures of activity that are shared between regions and dynamics
that are unique to each region. Existing alignment or multi-view methods
neglect temporal structure, whereas dynamical latent variable models capture
temporal dependencies but are usually restricted to a single area, assume
linear read-outs, or conflate shared and private signals. We introduce the
Coupled Transformer Autoencoder (CTAE) - a sequence model that addresses both
(i) non-stationary, non-linear dynamics and (ii) separation of shared versus
region-specific structure in a single framework. CTAE employs transformer
encoders and decoders to capture long-range neural dynamics and explicitly
partitions each region's latent space into orthogonal shared and private
subspaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CTAE on two high-density
electrophysiology datasets with simultaneous recordings from multiple regions,
one from motor cortical areas and the other from sensory areas. CTAE extracts
meaningful representations that better decode behavioral variables compared to
existing approaches.

Motivation: 现有的事后时间序列解释方法主要关注时间步级别的特征归因，忽略了分类结果主要由关键shapelet驱动的先验知识，需要弥补这一差距。

Method: ShapeX框架包含Shapelet描述与检测(SDD)框架，能够学习对分类至关重要的多样化shapelet集合，并将时间序列分割为有意义的shapelet驱动片段，使用Shapley值评估其显著性。

Conclusion: ShapeX通过利用shapelet的原子性特性，能够产生揭示因果关系而不仅仅是相关性的解释，为高风险应用中的时间序列分类模型提供了更透明的解释方法。

Abstract: Explaining time series classification models is crucial, particularly in
high-stakes applications such as healthcare and finance, where transparency and
trust play a critical role. Although numerous time series classification
methods have identified key subsequences, known as shapelets, as core features
for achieving state-of-the-art performance and validating their pivotal role in
classification outcomes, existing post-hoc time series explanation (PHTSE)
methods primarily focus on timestep-level feature attribution. These
explanation methods overlook the fundamental prior that classification outcomes
are predominantly driven by key shapelets. To bridge this gap, we present
ShapeX, an innovative framework that segments time series into meaningful
shapelet-driven segments and employs Shapley values to assess their saliency.
At the core of ShapeX lies the Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) framework,
which effectively learns a diverse set of shapelets essential for
classification. We further demonstrate that ShapeX produces explanations which
reveal causal relationships instead of just correlations, owing to the
atomicity properties of shapelets. Experimental results on both synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that ShapeX outperforms existing methods in
identifying the most relevant subsequences, enhancing both the precision and
causal fidelity of time series explanations.

Conclusion: 该模型通过双头架构和混合损失函数有效解决了自杀风险检测中的多维度挑战，在保持风险等级有序性的同时实现准确分类。

Abstract: Social media platforms have become important sources for identifying suicide
risk, but automated detection systems face multiple challenges including severe
class imbalance, temporal complexity in posting patterns, and the dual nature
of risk levels as both ordinal and categorical. This paper proposes a
hierarchical dual-head neural network based on MentalRoBERTa for suicide risk
classification into four levels: indicator, ideation, behavior, and attempt.
The model employs two complementary prediction heads operating on a shared
sequence representation: a CORAL (Consistent Rank Logits) head that preserves
ordinal relationships between risk levels, and a standard classification head
that enables flexible categorical distinctions. A 3-layer Transformer encoder
with 8-head multi-head attention models temporal dependencies across post
sequences, while explicit time interval embeddings capture posting behavior
dynamics. The model is trained with a combined loss function (0.5 CORAL + 0.3
Cross-Entropy + 0.2 Focal Loss) that simultaneously addresses ordinal structure
preservation, overconfidence reduction, and class imbalance. To improve
computational efficiency, we freeze the first 6 layers (50%) of MentalRoBERTa
and employ mixed-precision training. The model is evaluated using 5-fold
stratified cross-validation with macro F1 score as the primary metric.

Conclusion: 建立了一类同时具备可证明一致性、样本效率和实际可扩展性的RL因果发现算法，标志着将经验性能与严格有限样本理论统一的关键进展。

Abstract: Causal discovery remains a central challenge in machine learning, yet
existing methods face a fundamental gap: algorithms like GES and GraN-DAG
achieve strong empirical performance but lack finite-sample guarantees, while
theoretically principled approaches fail to scale. We close this gap by
introducing a game-theoretic reinforcement learning framework for causal
discovery, where a DDQN agent directly competes against a strong baseline (GES
or GraN-DAG), always warm-starting from the opponent's solution. This design
yields three provable guarantees: the learned graph is never worse than the
opponent, warm-starting strictly accelerates convergence, and most importantly,
with high probability the algorithm selects the true best candidate graph. To
the best of our knowledge, our result makes a first-of-its-kind progress in
explaining such finite-sample guarantees in causal discovery: on synthetic SEMs
(30 nodes), the observed error probability decays with n, tightly matching
theory. On real-world benchmarks including Sachs, Asia, Alarm, Child, Hepar2,
Dream, and Andes, our method consistently improves upon GES and GraN-DAG while
remaining theoretically safe. Remarkably, it scales to large graphs such as
Hepar2 (70 nodes), Dream (100 nodes), and Andes (220 nodes). Together, these
results establish a new class of RL-based causal discovery algorithms that are
simultaneously provably consistent, sample-efficient, and practically scalable,
marking a decisive step toward unifying empirical performance with rigorous
finite-sample theory.

*Ayatullah Faruk Mollah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的维度加权方案，并将其整合到KNN分类器中，通过加权Minkowski距离改进了传统KNN在模式分类中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多维样本的模式分类中，基于权重的维度距离度量很重要，但常用的欧氏距离存在诸多问题，需要更好的距离度量和维度加权方法。

Method: 提出了新的维度加权方案，并将其整合到KNN分类器中，使用加权Minkowski距离来调节包含k个参考样本区域的大小和形状。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现良好，特别是在基因表达数据集上，分类准确率显著提高了约10%，在不同k值的交叉验证实验中表现一致。

Conclusion: 该方法是对传统KNN分类器的重要推广，通过加权Minkowski距离和新的加权方案，在高维小样本数据集中能更有效地选择最近邻。

Abstract: Studies on various facets of pattern classification is often imperative while
working with multi-dimensional samples pertaining to diverse application
scenarios. In this notion, weighted dimension-based distance measure has been
one of the vital considerations in pattern analysis as it reflects the degree
of similarity between samples. Though it is often presumed to be settled with
the pervasive use of Euclidean distance, plethora of issues often surface. In
this paper, we present (a) a detail analysis on the impact of distance measure
norms and weights of dimensions along with visualization, (b) a novel weighting
scheme for each dimension, (c) incorporation of this dimensional weighting
schema into a KNN classifier, and (d) pattern classification on a variety of
synthetic as well as realistic datasets with the developed model. It has
performed well across diverse experiments in comparison to the traditional KNN
under the same experimental setups. Specifically, for gene expression datasets,
it yields significant and consistent gain in classification accuracy (around
10%) in all cross-validation experiments with different values of k. As such
datasets contain limited number of samples of high dimensions, meaningful
selection of nearest neighbours is desirable, and this requirement is
reasonably met by regulating the shape and size of the region enclosing the k
number of reference samples with the developed weighting schema and appropriate
norm. It, therefore, stands as an important generalization of KNN classifier
powered by weighted Minkowski distance with the present weighting schema.

TL;DR: 提出一种完全解耦的训练策略来解决原型自监督学习中的原型崩溃问题，通过独立的在线EM风格过程更新原型，消除原型崩溃并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原型自监督学习方法普遍存在部分原型崩溃问题，多个原型收敛到几乎相同的表示，这破坏了提供多样化目标的核心目的，导致需要过度参数化或添加临时正则化器。

Method: 引入完全解耦的训练策略，将原型和编码器在独立目标下学习。将原型建模为高斯混合模型，使用在线EM风格过程更新，独立于编码器的损失函数。

Result: 这种简单而原则性的解耦消除了原型崩溃，无需显式正则化，产生持续多样化的原型和更强的下游性能。

Conclusion: 通过打破原型和编码器的联合优化，解决了原型崩溃的根本原因，提供了一种更有效的自监督学习方法。

Abstract: Prototypical self-supervised learning methods consistently suffer from
partial prototype collapse, where multiple prototypes converge to nearly
identical representations. This undermines their central purpose -- providing
diverse and informative targets to guide encoders toward rich representations
-- and has led practitioners to over-parameterize prototype sets or add ad-hoc
regularizers, which mitigate symptoms rather than address the root cause. We
empirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and
prototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training
prototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without
necessarily enhancing representation diversity. To break the joint
optimization, we introduce a fully decoupled training strategy that learns
prototypes and encoders under separate objectives. Concretely, we model
prototypes as a Gaussian mixture updated with an online EM-style procedure,
independent of the encoder's loss. This simple yet principled decoupling
eliminates prototype collapse without explicit regularization and yields
consistently diverse prototypes and stronger downstream performance.

*Arian Prabowo,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 当前时序基础模型表现不佳，原因在于盲目套用NLP/CV范式。时序数据缺乏概念密度，需要基于不变性原则构建数据集，而非简单聚合数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时序基础模型表现不如轻量监督基线和经典模型，这是因为错误地引入了NLP或CV的流程。时序数据与语言和视觉数据不同，缺乏概念密度（如没有包含'苹果'概念的时序数据集）。

Method: 建议从机会主义聚合转向原则性设计：构建能够系统覆盖保持时序语义不变性空间的数据集。基于第一原则构建时序不变性本体论。

Result: 当前基于在线抓取一切数据的范式在时序领域失败，需要新的方法论。

Conclusion: 只有通过确保不变性覆盖来实现表征完整性，时序基础模型才能获得必要的对齐结构，实现泛化、推理和真正的涌现行为。

Abstract: Timeseries foundation models (TSFMs) have multiplied, yet lightweight
supervised baselines and even classical models often match them. We argue this
gap stems from the naive importation of NLP or CV pipelines. In language and
vision, large web-scale corpora densely capture human concepts i.e. there are
countless images and text of apples. In contrast, timeseries data is built to
complement the image and text modalities. There are no timeseries dataset that
contains the concept apple. As a result, the scrape-everything-online paradigm
fails for TS. We posit that progress demands a shift from opportunistic
aggregation to principled design: constructing datasets that systematically
span the space of invariance that preserve temporal semantics. To this end, we
suggest that the ontology of timeseries invariances should be built based on
first principles. Only by ensuring representational completeness through
invariance coverage can TSFMs achieve the aligned structure necessary for
generalisation, reasoning, and truly emergent behaviour.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究通过多层图扩散模型揭示了阿尔茨海默病中tau蛋白传播的结构连接和功能连接相互作用机制，发现SC和FC在不同脑区对tau传播的贡献存在区域不对称性，且这种主导关系随疾病进展而变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经影像学证据显示tau蛋白沿着特定脑网络积累，但结构连接和功能连接如何相互作用影响tau传播尚不清楚。

Method: 利用大量纵向神经影像数据，通过多层图扩散模型研究SC-FC相互作用对tau传播的影响。

Result: 发现FC主要驱动皮层下区域、岛叶、额叶和颞叶皮层的tau传播，而SC在枕叶、顶叶和边缘区域起更大作用；SC和FC的相对主导地位随疾病进展而变化；SC和FC主导区域的模式与AD相关基因表达高度一致。

Conclusion: 结构连接和功能连接在tau传播中发挥区域特异性和阶段依赖性的作用，非可改变风险因素通过改变解剖和功能通路的主导路径来重塑tau传播。

Abstract: Emerging neuroimaging evidence shows that pathological tau proteins build up
along specific brain networks, suggesting that large-scale network architecture
plays a key role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how
structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) interact to
influence tau propagation remains unclear. Leveraging an unprecedented volume
of longitudinal neuroimaging data, we examine SC-FC interactions through a
multi-layer graph diffusion model. Beyond showing that connectome architecture
constrains tau spread, our model reveals a regionally asymmetric contribution
of SC and FC. Specifically, FC predominantly drives tau spread in subcortical
areas, the insula, frontal and temporal cortices, whereas SC plays a larger
role in occipital, parietal, and limbic regions. The relative dominance of SC
versus FC shifts over the course of disease, with FC generally prevailing in
early AD and SC becoming primary in later stages. Spatial patterns of SC- and
FC-dominant regions strongly align with the regional expression of
AD-associated genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and lysosomal
function, including CHUK (IKK-alpha), TMEM106B, MCL1, NOTCH1, and TH. In
parallel, other non-modifiable risk factors (e.g., APOE genotype, sex) and
biological mechanisms (e.g., amyloid deposition) selectively reshape tau
propagation by shifting dominant routes between anatomical and functional
pathways in a region-specific manner. Findings are validated in an independent
AD cohort.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有使用固定方差噪声的差分隐私方法会降低模型性能和训练效率，需要一种能动态调整隐私保护强度的解决方案。

Method: 采用自适应差分隐私和方差缩减随机梯度推送，结合渐进梯度融合策略利用历史梯度，并集成去中心化推送求和与聚合技术。

Result: 理论分析证明ADP-VRSGP在适当学习率下实现鲁棒收敛，实验结果显示在多种场景下优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: ADP-VRSGP有效解决了隐私保护去中心化学习中的挑战，在保证隐私的同时显著提升了训练稳定性和速度。

Abstract: Differential privacy is widely employed in decentralized learning to
safeguard sensitive data by introducing noise into model updates. However,
existing approaches that use fixed-variance noise often degrade model
performance and reduce training efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel approach called decentralized learning with adaptive
differential privacy via variance-reduced stochastic gradient push (ADP-VRSGP).
This method dynamically adjusts both the noise variance and the learning rate
using a stepwise-decaying schedule, which accelerates training and enhances
final model performance while providing node-level personalized privacy
guarantees. To counteract the slowed convergence caused by large-variance noise
in early iterations, we introduce a progressive gradient fusion strategy that
leverages historical gradients. Furthermore, ADP-VRSGP incorporates
decentralized push-sum and aggregation techniques, making it particularly
suitable for time-varying communication topologies. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that ADP-VRSGP achieves robust convergence
with an appropriate learning rate, significantly improving training stability
and speed. Experimental results validate that our method outperforms existing
baselines across multiple scenarios, highlighting its efficacy in addressing
the challenges of privacy-preserving decentralized learning.

TL;DR: 提出Hyper Tour Guided Neighborhood Search (HyperNS)方法解决大规模TSP问题，通过聚类和超导览策略缩小搜索空间，在大型实例上优于现有神经方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经方法在解决大规模TSP时面临内存限制、初始解质量不高和全局引导不足等挑战，特别是在处理大型实例时。

Method: 采用"先聚类后路由"策略，使用稀疏热图图将TSP实例划分为簇并抽象为超节点，生成超导览来指导初始化和优化过程，聚焦与超导览相关的边。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有神经方法，特别是在处理更大规模实例时，显著缩小了与最优解的差距。

Conclusion: HyperNS方法通过超导览引导的邻域搜索有效解决了大规模TSP问题，在可扩展性和解质量方面表现出色。

Abstract: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard problem that has
garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. While
neural-based methods have shown promise for solving TSPs, they still face
challenges in scaling to larger instances, particularly in memory constraints
associated with global heatmaps, edge weights, or access matrices, as well as
in generating high-quality initial solutions and insufficient global guidance
for efficiently navigating vast search spaces. To address these challenges, we
propose a Hyper Tour Guided Neighborhood Search (HyperNS) method for
large-scale TSP instances. Inspired by the ``clustering first, route second"
strategy, our approach initially divides the TSP instance into clusters using a
sparse heatmap graph and abstracts them as supernodes, followed by the
generation of a hyper tour to guide both the initialization and optimization
processes. This method reduces the search space by focusing on edges relevant
to the hyper tour, leading to more efficient and effective optimization.
Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing neural-based methods, particularly in
handling larger-scale instances, offering a significant reduction in the gap to
the optimal solution.

TL;DR: RLEV通过将明确的人类价值信号直接整合到奖励函数中，扩展了RLVR框架，使LLM优化与可量化的人类价值对齐，在多项RL算法和模型规模上持续优于仅基于正确性的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然RLVR在客观领域使用二元正确性奖励有效训练模型，但它忽略了并非所有任务都同等重要。RLEV旨在通过将人类定义的价值信号直接纳入奖励函数来解决这一问题。

Method: RLEV使用带有明确真实价值标签的考试风格数据，将人类价值信号直接整合到奖励函数中。该方法通过价值加权梯度放大在序列结束标记上学习价值敏感的终止策略。

Result: RLEV策略不仅提高了价值加权准确率，还学习了价值敏感的终止策略：对低价值提示简洁，对高价值提示详尽。消融研究证实收益与价值对齐存在因果关系。

Conclusion: 即使在噪声价值信号（如基于难度的标签）下，RLEV仍保持稳健，表明优化明确效用函数为将LLM与人类优先级对齐提供了实用路径。

Abstract: We propose Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values (RLEV), a method
that aligns Large Language Model (LLM) optimization directly with quantifiable
human value signals. While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) effectively trains models in objective domains using binary correctness
rewards, it overlooks that not all tasks are equally significant. RLEV extends
this framework by incorporating human-defined value signals directly into the
reward function. Using exam-style data with explicit ground-truth value labels,
RLEV consistently outperforms correctness-only baselines across multiple RL
algorithms and model scales. Crucially, RLEV policies not only improve
value-weighted accuracy but also learn a value-sensitive termination policy:
concise for low-value prompts, thorough for high-value ones. We demonstrate
this behavior stems from value-weighted gradient amplification on
end-of-sequence tokens. Ablation studies confirm the gain is causally linked to
value alignment. RLEV remains robust under noisy value signals, such as
difficulty-based labels, demonstrating that optimizing for an explicit utility
function offers a practical path to aligning LLMs with human priorities.

Motivation: 传统约束强化学习只关注期望累积奖励，忽略了奖励分布尾部的风险事件，这在高风险应用中是不够的。

Method: 使用优化确定性等价在奖励值和时间维度上提供每阶段鲁棒性，通过参数化强拉格朗日对偶框架确保与原始问题的等价性。

Result: 提出的算法在常见假设下具有收敛性，数值实验验证了其风险感知特性。

Conclusion: 该框架为高风险应用提供了有效的风险感知约束强化学习解决方案，能够处理奖励分布尾部的风险事件。

Abstract: Constrained optimization provides a common framework for dealing with
conflicting objectives in reinforcement learning (RL). In most of these
settings, the objectives (and constraints) are expressed though the expected
accumulated reward. However, this formulation neglects risky or even possibly
catastrophic events at the tails of the reward distribution, and is often
insufficient for high-stakes applications in which the risk involved in
outliers is critical. In this work, we propose a framework for risk-aware
constrained RL, which exhibits per-stage robustness properties jointly in
reward values and time using optimized certainty equivalents (OCEs). Our
framework ensures an exact equivalent to the original constrained problem
within a parameterized strong Lagrangian duality framework under appropriate
constraint qualifications, and yields a simple algorithmic recipe which can be
wrapped around standard RL solvers, such as PPO. Lastly, we establish the
convergence of the proposed algorithm under common assumptions, and verify the
risk-aware properties of our approach through several numerical experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种可复制性的松弛概念：点态可复制性、近似可复制性和半可复制性，并在这些松弛条件下实现了样本最优的不可知PAC学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于完全可复制性在简单任务（如阈值学习）中已被证明是不可能的，因此需要探索在何种近似可复制性概念下学习仍然是可行的。

Method: 提出了三种可复制性的松弛概念：(1)点态可复制性：学习器在任意固定输入上保持一致；(2)近似可复制性：学习器输出对大部分分布一致的假设；(3)半可复制性：算法完全可复制，但可使用共享的未标记样本。

Result: 对于常数可复制性参数，在所有三种情况下都获得了样本最优的不可知PAC学习器：(1)和(2)使用Θ(d/α²)样本即可实现，而(3)需要Θ(d²/α²)标记样本。

Conclusion: 通过适当的可复制性松弛，可以在不显著增加样本复杂度的情况下实现稳定的学习算法，其中点态和近似可复制性几乎"免费"获得，而半可复制性需要更多标记样本。

Abstract: Replicability, introduced by (Impagliazzo et al. STOC '22), is the notion
that algorithms should remain stable under a resampling of their inputs (given
access to shared randomness). While a strong and interesting notion of
stability, the cost of replicability can be prohibitive: there is no replicable
algorithm, for instance, for tasks as simple as threshold learning (Bun et al.
STOC '23). Given such strong impossibility results we ask: under what
approximate notions of replicability is learning possible?
  In this work, we propose three natural relaxations of replicability in the
context of PAC learning: (1) Pointwise: the learner must be consistent on any
fixed input, but not across all inputs simultaneously, (2) Approximate: the
learner must output hypotheses that classify most of the distribution
consistently, (3) Semi: the algorithm is fully replicable, but may additionally
use shared unlabeled samples. In all three cases, for constant replicability
parameters, we obtain sample-optimal agnostic PAC learners: (1) and (2) are
achievable for ``free" using $\Theta(d/\alpha^2)$ samples, while (3) requires
$\Theta(d^2/\alpha^2)$ labeled samples.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了使用金毛猎犬寿命研究队列的常规实验室数据进行癌症风险分类的可行性，发现虽然存在可检测的癌症信号，但由于信号太弱且与正常衰老或其他炎症状况混淆，无法实现可靠的临床分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发用于犬类早期癌症检测的无创筛查工具是兽医医学的重要挑战。常规实验室数据作为低成本来源具有潜力，但受到个体生物标志物非特异性和筛查人群中严重类别不平衡的限制。

Method: 在真实世界约束下，使用金毛猎犬寿命研究队列，系统比较了126个分析流程，包括多种机器学习模型、特征选择方法和数据平衡技术，采用患者级数据分区防止泄漏。

Result: 最优模型（带类别加权的逻辑回归分类器和递归特征消除）显示出中等排序能力（AUROC = 0.815），但临床分类性能差（F1-score = 0.25，阳性预测值 = 0.15）。虽然阴性预测值高（0.98），但召回率不足（0.79）无法作为可靠的排除测试。

Conclusion: 常规实验室数据中存在统计上可检测的癌症信号，但信号太弱且与正常衰老或其他炎症状况混淆，无法实现可靠的临床区分。这项工作为该数据模式单独使用设定了关键性能上限，并强调计算兽医肿瘤学的有意义的进展需要多模态数据源的整合。

Abstract: The development of accessible screening tools for early cancer detection in
dogs represents a significant challenge in veterinary medicine. Routine
laboratory data offer a promising, low-cost source for such tools, but their
utility is hampered by the non-specificity of individual biomarkers and the
severe class imbalance inherent in screening populations. This study assesses
the feasibility of cancer risk classification using the Golden Retriever
Lifetime Study (GRLS) cohort under real-world constraints, including the
grouping of diverse cancer types and the inclusion of post-diagnosis samples. A
comprehensive benchmark evaluation was conducted, systematically comparing 126
analytical pipelines that comprised various machine learning models, feature
selection methods, and data balancing techniques. Data were partitioned at the
patient level to prevent leakage. The optimal model, a Logistic Regression
classifier with class weighting and recursive feature elimination, demonstrated
moderate ranking ability (AUROC = 0.815; 95% CI: 0.793-0.836) but poor clinical
classification performance (F1-score = 0.25, Positive Predictive Value = 0.15).
While a high Negative Predictive Value (0.98) was achieved, insufficient recall
(0.79) precludes its use as a reliable rule-out test. Interpretability analysis
with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed that predictions were driven
by non-specific features like age and markers of inflammation and anemia. It is
concluded that while a statistically detectable cancer signal exists in routine
lab data, it is too weak and confounded for clinically reliable discrimination
from normal aging or other inflammatory conditions. This work establishes a
critical performance ceiling for this data modality in isolation and
underscores that meaningful progress in computational veterinary oncology will
require integration of multi-modal data sources.

Conclusion: CO-PFL通过贡献导向的聚合策略有效缓解了聚合偏差，增强了全局协调，并通过构建定制化子模型和稳定更新来提升本地性能。

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) addresses a critical challenge of
collaboratively training customized models for clients with heterogeneous and
scarce local data. Conventional federated learning, which relies on a single
consensus model, proves inadequate under such data heterogeneity. Its standard
aggregation method of weighting client updates heuristically or by data volume,
operates under an equal-contribution assumption, failing to account for the
actual utility and reliability of each client's update. This often results in
suboptimal personalization and aggregation bias. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce Contribution-Oriented PFL (CO-PFL), a novel algorithm that
dynamically estimates each client's contribution for global aggregation. CO-PFL
performs a joint assessment by analyzing both gradient direction discrepancies
and prediction deviations, leveraging information from gradient and data
subspaces. This dual-subspace analysis provides a principled and discriminative
aggregation weight for each client, emphasizing high-quality updates.
Furthermore, to bolster personalization adaptability and optimization
stability, CO-PFL cohesively integrates a parameter-wise personalization
mechanism with mask-aware momentum optimization. Our approach effectively
mitigates aggregation bias, strengthens global coordination, and enhances local
performance by facilitating the construction of tailored submodels with stable
updates. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR10C,
CINIC10, and Mini-ImageNet) confirm that CO-PFL consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in in personalization accuracy, robustness,
scalability and convergence stability.

demonstrates remarkable adaptability in fine-tuning univariate time series
foundation model by solely updating the static embedding C while preserving
pretrained weights, thereby reducing computational overhead and achieving
superior fine-tuning performance.

Conclusion: MetaVD通过贝叶斯元学习方法有效解决了联邦学习中的非IID数据挑战，提升了模型性能和通信效率。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aims to train a global inference model from remotely
distributed clients, gaining popularity due to its benefit of improving data
privacy. However, traditional FL often faces challenges in practical
applications, including model overfitting and divergent local models due to
limited and non-IID data among clients. To address these issues, we introduce a
novel Bayesian meta-learning approach called meta-variational dropout (MetaVD).
MetaVD learns to predict client-dependent dropout rates via a shared
hypernetwork, enabling effective model personalization of FL algorithms in
limited non-IID data settings. We also emphasize the posterior adaptation view
of meta-learning and the posterior aggregation view of Bayesian FL via the
conditional dropout posterior. We conducted extensive experiments on various
sparse and non-IID FL datasets. MetaVD demonstrated excellent classification
accuracy and uncertainty calibration performance, especially for
out-of-distribution (OOD) clients. MetaVD compresses the local model parameters
needed for each client, mitigating model overfitting and reducing communication
costs. Code is available at https://github.com/insujeon/MetaVD.

Abstract: We introduce SpLIIF to generate implicit neural representations and enable
arbitrary downscaling of weather variables. We train a model from sparse
weather stations and topography over Japan and evaluate in- and
out-of-distribution accuracy predicting temperature and wind, comparing it to
both an interpolation baseline and CorrDiff. We find the model to be up to 50%
better than both CorrDiff and the baseline at downscaling temperature, and
around 10-20% better for wind.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可证明收敛的多目标强化学习框架，采用max-min准则，通过博弈论视角将其重构为双人零和正则化连续博弈，基于镜像下降设计高效算法，确保全局收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多目标强化学习中max-min准则的收敛性问题，从博弈论角度提供理论保证，同时保持算法的实用性。

Method: 将max-min多目标强化学习重构为双人零和正则化连续博弈，采用镜像下降算法简化策略更新，并引入自适应正则化提升性能。

Result: 在表格设置中验证了收敛行为，在深度强化学习实现中显著优于先前基线方法，在多个MORL环境中表现出色。

Conclusion: 提出的框架既具有理论收敛保证，又在实践中表现优异，为多目标强化学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a provably convergent and practical framework for
multi-objective reinforcement learning with max-min criterion. From a
game-theoretic perspective, we reformulate max-min multi-objective
reinforcement learning as a two-player zero-sum regularized continuous game and
introduce an efficient algorithm based on mirror descent. Our approach
simplifies the policy update while ensuring global last-iterate convergence. We
provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis on our algorithm, including
iteration complexity under both exact and approximate policy evaluations, as
well as sample complexity bounds. To further enhance performance, we modify the
proposed algorithm with adaptive regularization. Our experiments demonstrate
the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm in tabular settings, and our
implementation for deep reinforcement learning significantly outperforms
previous baselines in many MORL environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LKM的自知识蒸馏方法，能够在几乎不增加计算复杂度的情况下显著提升图神经网络在分子性质预测中的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络是目前预测分子性质最有效的方法，但需要更准确的模型。增加模型复杂度虽然能提高准确性，但会显著增加计算成本和内存需求。

Method: 开发了层到层知识混合(LKM)方法，通过最小化GNN层间预存在隐藏嵌入的平均绝对距离，有效聚合多跳和多尺度信息，改善局部和全局分子特征的表示。

Result: 在三个GNN架构和多个数据集上的评估显示，LKM能将量子化学和生物物理性质预测的平均绝对误差降低高达9.8%(QM9)、45.3%(MD17能量)和22.9%(Chignolin)。

Conclusion: LKM方法能够在不显著增加训练和推理成本的情况下，显著提高GNN在化学性质预测中的准确性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the currently most effective methods for
predicting molecular properties but there remains a need for more accurate
models. GNN accuracy can be improved by increasing the model complexity but
this also increases the computational cost and memory requirement during
training and inference. In this study, we develop Layer-to-Layer Knowledge
Mixing (LKM), a novel self-knowledge distillation method that increases the
accuracy of state-of-the-art GNNs while adding negligible computational
complexity during training and inference. By minimizing the mean absolute
distance between pre-existing hidden embeddings of GNN layers, LKM efficiently
aggregates multi-hop and multi-scale information, enabling improved
representation of both local and global molecular features. We evaluated LKM
using three diverse GNN architectures (DimeNet++, MXMNet, and PAMNet) using
datasets of quantum chemical properties (QM9, MD17 and Chignolin). We found
that the LKM method effectively reduces the mean absolute error of quantum
chemical and biophysical property predictions by up to 9.8% (QM9), 45.3% (MD17
Energy), and 22.9% (Chignolin). This work demonstrates the potential of LKM to
significantly improve the accuracy of GNNs for chemical property prediction
without any substantial increase in training and inference cost.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了选择性分类差距的概念，将模型性能与完美排序oracle之间的差距分解为五个来源：贝叶斯噪声、近似误差、排序误差、统计噪声和实现/分布偏移松弛。研究发现单调后校准对缩小这一差距作用有限，需要能重新排序预测的评分机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前选择性分类器难以达到完美排序oracle的性能水平，需要系统分析性能差距的来源，为构建更接近理想oracle行为的选择性分类器提供理论指导。

Method: 提出选择性分类差距的有限样本分解框架，将差距分解为五个组成部分，通过合成数据和真实世界基准进行验证实验，隔离每个误差成分。

Result: 验证了贝叶斯噪声和有限模型容量会导致显著差距，只有特征感知校准器能显著改善评分排序，数据偏移会引入需要分布鲁棒训练的松弛项。

Conclusion: 该分解提供了定量误差预算和可操作的设计指南，帮助实践者构建更接近理想oracle行为的选择性分类器。

Abstract: Selective classifiers improve model reliability by abstaining on inputs the
model deems uncertain. However, few practical approaches achieve the
gold-standard performance of a perfect-ordering oracle that accepts examples
exactly in order of correctness. Our work formalizes this shortfall as the
selective-classification gap and present the first finite-sample decomposition
of this gap to five distinct sources of looseness: Bayes noise, approximation
error, ranking error, statistical noise, and implementation- or shift-induced
slack. Crucially, our analysis reveals that monotone post-hoc calibration --
often believed to strengthen selective classifiers -- has limited impact on
closing this gap, since it rarely alters the model's underlying score ranking.
Bridging the gap therefore requires scoring mechanisms that can effectively
reorder predictions rather than merely rescale them. We validate our
decomposition on synthetic two-moons data and on real-world vision and language
benchmarks, isolating each error component through controlled experiments. Our
results confirm that (i) Bayes noise and limited model capacity can account for
substantial gaps, (ii) only richer, feature-aware calibrators meaningfully
improve score ordering, and (iii) data shift introduces a separate slack that
demands distributionally robust training. Together, our decomposition yields a
quantitative error budget as well as actionable design guidelines that
practitioners can use to build selective classifiers which approximate ideal
oracle behavior more closely.

TL;DR: FedGPS是一个联邦学习框架，通过整合统计分布和梯度信息来解决数据异构性问题，在各种异构场景下表现出优越的性能和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在联邦学习的数据异构性问题上取得了进展，但在不同异构场景下的鲁棒性不足，且如何利用统计信息来缓解异构性是一个被忽视的问题。

Method: FedGPS框架静态地修改每个客户端的学习目标以使用代理信息隐式建模全局数据分布，同时动态地在每轮调整本地更新方向，整合其他客户端的梯度信息。

Result: 大量实验表明，FedGPS在各种异构场景下都优于现有最先进方法，验证了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FedGPS通过无缝整合统计分布和梯度信息，有效解决了联邦学习中的数据异构性问题，在各种异构场景下表现出强大的性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) confronts a significant challenge known as data
heterogeneity, which impairs model performance and convergence. Existing
methods have made notable progress in addressing this issue. However, improving
performance in certain heterogeneity scenarios remains an overlooked question:
\textit{How robust are these methods to deploy under diverse heterogeneity
scenarios?} To answer this, we conduct comprehensive evaluations across varied
heterogeneity scenarios, showing that most existing methods exhibit limited
robustness. Meanwhile, insights from these experiments highlight that sharing
statistical information can mitigate heterogeneity by enabling clients to
update with a global perspective. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{FedGPS}
(\textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{G}oal-\textbf{P}ath \textbf{S}ynergy), a novel
framework that seamlessly integrates statistical distribution and gradient
information from others. Specifically, FedGPS statically modifies each client's
learning objective to implicitly model the global data distribution using
surrogate information, while dynamically adjusting local update directions with
gradient information from other clients at each round. Extensive experiments
show that FedGPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse
heterogeneity scenarios, validating its effectiveness and robustness. The code

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OpTI-BFM是一种乐观决策标准，通过直接建模奖励函数的不确定性，指导行为基础模型在测试时通过环境交互进行任务推断，实现少量回合内识别和优化未见奖励函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行为基础模型(BFMs)需要计算推理数据集上的奖励，这要么需要奖励函数的形式化访问，要么需要大量标注工作。为了缓解这些限制，研究旨在通过测试时与环境的纯交互来解决任务推断问题。

Method: 提出OpTI-BFM乐观决策标准，直接建模奖励函数的不确定性，指导BFMs进行任务推断的数据收集。该方法与线性bandits的上置信界算法有直接联系。

Result: 在已建立的零样本基准测试中，OpTI-BFM使基于后继特征的BFMs能够在少量回合内以最小计算开销识别和优化未见奖励函数。

Conclusion: OpTI-BFM为训练良好的BFMs提供了遗憾边界，并通过与环境的直接交互实现了高效的任务推断，减少了数据需求。

Abstract: Behavior Foundation Models (BFMs) are capable of retrieving high-performing
policy for any reward function specified directly at test-time, commonly
referred to as zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL). While this is a very
efficient process in terms of compute, it can be less so in terms of data: as a
standard assumption, BFMs require computing rewards over a non-negligible
inference dataset, assuming either access to a functional form of rewards, or
significant labeling efforts. To alleviate these limitations, we tackle the
problem of task inference purely through interaction with the environment at
test-time. We propose OpTI-BFM, an optimistic decision criterion that directly
models uncertainty over reward functions and guides BFMs in data collection for
task inference. Formally, we provide a regret bound for well-trained BFMs
through a direct connection to upper-confidence algorithms for linear bandits.
Empirically, we evaluate OpTI-BFM on established zero-shot benchmarks, and
observe that it enables successor-features-based BFMs to identify and optimize
an unseen reward function in a handful of episodes with minimal compute
overhead. Code is available at https://github.com/ThomasRupf/opti-bfm.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ImpossibleBench是一个用于量化、研究和缓解LLM代理利用测试用例作弊行为的基准框架，通过创建任务规范与单元测试直接冲突的"不可能"任务来测量作弊率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM倾向于寻找和利用"捷径"完成任务，这种行为会破坏基准测试的有效性和实际部署的可靠性，比如删除失败测试而非修复bug。

Method: 从现有基准创建"不可能"任务变体，引入自然语言规范与单元测试的直接冲突，测量代理在这些任务上的通过率作为作弊率。

Result: 揭示了从简单测试修改到复杂运算符重载的作弊行为细节，展示了提示、测试访问和反馈循环对作弊率的影响，提供了已验证的欺骗解决方案测试平台。

Conclusion: ImpossibleBench是一个实用的多功能工具，可用于构建更健壮可靠的LLM系统，包括研究模型行为、上下文工程和开发监控工具。

Abstract: The tendency to find and exploit "shortcuts" to complete tasks poses
significant risks for reliable assessment and deployment of large language
models (LLMs). For example, an LLM agent with access to unit tests may delete
failing tests rather than fix the underlying bug. Such behavior undermines both
the validity of benchmark results and the reliability of real-world LLM coding
assistant deployments.
  To quantify, study, and mitigate such behavior, we introduce ImpossibleBench,
a benchmark framework that systematically measures LLM agents' propensity to
exploit test cases. ImpossibleBench creates "impossible" variants of tasks from
existing benchmarks like LiveCodeBench and SWE-bench by introducing direct
conflicts between the natural-language specification and the unit tests. We
measure an agent's "cheating rate" as its pass rate on these impossible tasks,
where any pass necessarily implies a specification-violating shortcut.
  As a practical framework, ImpossibleBench is not just an evaluation but a
versatile tool. We demonstrate its utility for: (1) studying model behaviors,
revealing more fine-grained details of cheating behaviors from simple test
modification to complex operator overloading; (2) context engineering, showing
how prompt, test access and feedback loop affect cheating rates; and (3)
developing monitoring tools, providing a testbed with verified deceptive
solutions. We hope ImpossibleBench serves as a useful framework for building
more robust and reliable LLM systems.

Abstract: Topological features capture global geometric structure in imaging data, but
practical adoption in deep learning requires both computational efficiency and

use 128B-coalesced access and hierarchical shared-memory accumulation. Our
PyTorch layer learns thresholds in a single direction via a Differentiable

relevance, including applications highlighted by prior ECC work, and outline

TL;DR: PRM引导的树搜索在数学推理中相比Best-of-N选择没有显著改进，尽管成本更高。树搜索方法对不可靠的PRM分数依赖过强，需要不同的奖励建模方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的链式思维提示与Best-of-N选择在数学推理中采用线性结构，无法捕捉复杂问题解决的分支和探索性质。

Method: 提出自适应算法在难处理的动作空间中最大化过程奖励模型分数，研究PRM引导的树搜索是否能通过探索多个部分解路径来改进数学推理。

Result: 在23个多样化数学问题上，PRM引导的树搜索相比BoN无统计显著改进；蒙特卡洛树搜索和束搜索表现最佳；PRM对状态值近似差且可靠性随推理深度下降；PRM分布外泛化能力差。

Conclusion: 树搜索对不可靠PRM分数的过度依赖导致性能不佳，在树搜索能有效增强LLM数学推理之前需要不同的奖励建模方法。

Abstract: While chain-of-thought prompting with Best-of-N (BoN) selection has become
popular for mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs), its linear
structure fails to capture the branching and exploratory nature of complex
problem-solving. In this work, we propose an adaptive algorithm to maximize
process reward model (PRM) scores over the intractable action space, and
investigate whether PRM-guided tree search can improve mathematical reasoning
by exploring multiple partial solution paths. Across $23$ diverse mathematical
problems using Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct with its associated PRM as a case
study, we find that: (1) PRM-guided tree search shows no statistically
significant improvements over BoN despite higher costs, (2) Monte Carlo tree
search and beam search outperform other PRM-guided tree search methods, (3)
PRMs poorly approximate state values and their reliability degrades with
reasoning depth, and (4) PRMs generalize poorly out of distribution. This
underperformance stems from tree search's greater reliance on unreliable PRM
scores, suggesting different reward modeling is necessary before tree search
can effectively enhance mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

Result: 实验表明当前深度学习模型在所有类型时序特征上并未普遍接近最优基线。

Conclusion: SynTSBench框架能够系统评估时间序列预测模型的基本能力，为模型选择提供更清晰的定量依据。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have driven rapid progress in time series
forecasting, yet many state-of-the-art models continue to struggle with robust
performance in real-world applications, even when they achieve strong results
on standard benchmark datasets. This persistent gap can be attributed to the
black-box nature of deep learning architectures and the inherent limitations of
current evaluation frameworks, which frequently lack the capacity to provide
clear, quantitative insights into the specific strengths and weaknesses of
different models, thereby complicating the selection of appropriate models for
particular forecasting scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a
synthetic data-driven evaluation paradigm, SynTSBench, that systematically
assesses fundamental modeling capabilities of time series forecasting models
through programmable feature configuration. Our framework isolates confounding
factors and establishes an interpretable evaluation system with three core
analytical dimensions: (1) temporal feature decomposition and capability
mapping, which enables systematic evaluation of model capacities to learn
specific pattern types; (2) robustness analysis under data irregularities,
which quantifies noise tolerance thresholds and anomaly recovery capabilities;
and (3) theoretical optimum benchmarking, which establishes performance
boundaries for each pattern type-enabling direct comparison between model
predictions and mathematical optima. Our experiments show that current deep
learning models do not universally approach optimal baselines across all types
of temporal features.The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大-小模型协作框架中存在的精度显著下降、灾难性遗忘加剧以及小模型知识引发的幻觉问题。

Method: 采用KAN（Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks）作为协作模型架构，替代传统的MLP，利用KAN更好的可视化和可解释性来缓解灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在语言、视觉和视觉-语言跨模态任务中，KCM在保持任务精度接近大模型的同时，显著减少了大模型推理调用次数，并明显缓解了灾难性遗忘，对长尾数据有显著精度提升。

Conclusion: KCM在所有指标上都优于基于MLP的小协作模型(MCM)，为大规模模型协作提供了一种有效的改进方法。

Abstract: In recent years, Pretrained Large Models(PLMs) researchers proposed
large-small model collaboration frameworks, leveraged easily trainable small
models to assist large models, aim to(1) significantly reduce computational
resource consumption while maintaining comparable accuracy, and (2) enhance
large model performance in specialized domain tasks. However, this
collaborative paradigm suffers from issues such as significant accuracy
degradation, exacerbated catastrophic forgetting, and amplified hallucination
problems induced by small model knowledge. To address these challenges, we
propose a KAN-based Collaborative Model (KCM) as an improved approach to
large-small model collaboration. The KAN utilized in KCM represents an
alternative neural network architecture distinct from conventional MLPs.
Compared to MLPs, KAN offers superior visualizability and interpretability
while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. We deployed KCM in large-small model
collaborative systems across three scenarios: language, vision, and
vision-language cross-modal tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that,
compared with pure large model approaches, the large-small model collaboration
framework utilizing KCM as the collaborative model significantly reduces the
number of large model inference calls while maintaining near-identical task
accuracy, thereby substantially lowering computational resource consumption.
Concurrently, the KAN-based small collaborative model markedly mitigates
catastrophic forgetting, leading to significant accuracy improvements for
long-tail data. The results reveal that KCM demonstrates superior performance
across all metrics compared to MLP-based small collaborative models (MCM).

Conclusion: 使AI模型成为更好的研究助手更依赖于领域对齐的高质量数据训练，而非预训练规模或通用基准性能

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, the ultimate vision for their role
in science is emerging: we could build an AI collaborator to effectively assist
human beings throughout the entire scientific research process. We refer to
this envisioned system as ResearchGPT. Given that scientific research
progresses through multiple interdependent phases, achieving this vision
requires rigorous benchmarks that evaluate the end-to-end workflow rather than
isolated sub-tasks. To this end, we contribute CS-54k, a high-quality corpus of
scientific Q&A pairs in computer science, built from 14k CC-licensed papers. It
is constructed through a scalable, paper-grounded pipeline that combines
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multi-stage quality control to ensure
factual grounding. From this unified corpus, we derive two complementary
subsets: CS-4k, a carefully curated benchmark for evaluating AI's ability to
assist scientific research, and CS-50k, a large-scale training dataset.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CS-4k stratifies state-of-the-art LLMs
into distinct capability tiers. Open models trained on CS-50k with supervised
training and reinforcement learning demonstrate substantial improvements. Even
7B-scale models, when properly trained, outperform many larger proprietary
systems, such as GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. This indicates that
making AI models better research assistants relies more on domain-aligned
training with high-quality data than on pretraining scale or general benchmark
performance. We release CS-4k and CS-50k in the hope of fostering AI systems as
reliable collaborators in CS research.

Conclusion: 提出的IRM-free方法能够有效捕捉因果子图，在分布偏移下实现更好的泛化性能，为图神经网络处理分布外泛化问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution generalization under distributional shifts remains a
critical challenge for graph neural networks. Existing methods generally adopt
the Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) framework, requiring costly environment
annotations or heuristically generated synthetic splits. To circumvent these
limitations, in this work, we aim to develop an IRM-free method for capturing
causal subgraphs. We first identify that causal subgraphs exhibit substantially
smaller distributional variations than non-causal components across diverse
environments, which we formalize as the Invariant Distribution Criterion and
theoretically prove in this paper. Building on this criterion, we
systematically uncover the quantitative relationship between distributional
shift and representation norm for identifying the causal subgraph, and
investigate its underlying mechanisms in depth. Finally, we propose an IRM-free
method by introducing a norm-guided invariant distribution objective for causal
subgraph discovery and prediction. Extensive experiments on two widely used
benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in graph generalization.

Abstract: Brain tumors are a challenging problem in neuro-oncology, where early and
precise diagnosis is important for successful treatment. Deep learning-based
brain tumor classification methods often rely on heavy data augmentation which
can limit generalization and trust in clinical applications. In this paper, we
propose a double-backbone network integrating VGG16 and Xception with a

features. Unlike previous studies, our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance without augmentation which demonstrates robustness to variably
sized and distributed datasets. For further transparency, Grad-CAM is
integrated to visualize the tumor regions based on which the model is giving
prediction, bridging the gap between model prediction and clinical
interpretability. The proposed framework achieves 99.24\% accuracy on the 7K-DS
dataset for the 4-class setting, along with 98.68\% and 99.85\% in the 3-class
and 2-class settings, respectively. On the independent 3K-DS dataset, the model
generalizes with 95.77\% accuracy, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art
methods. To further support clinical usability, we developed a graphical user
interface (GUI) that provides real-time classification and Grad-CAM-based tumor
localization. These findings suggest that augmentation-free, interpretable, and
deployable deep learning models such as DB-FGA-Net hold strong potential for
reliable clinical translation in brain tumor diagnosis.

*Yuhang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InvDec提出了一种混合架构，通过倒置解码器实现时间编码和变量级解码的分离，在高维时间序列数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法同时有效建模时间模式和跨变量依赖关系：通道独立方法忽略变量相关性，而纯变量注意力方法牺牲时间编码能力。

Method: 结合基于patch的时间编码器和通过变量级自注意力操作的倒置解码器，引入延迟变量嵌入和自适应残差融合机制。

Result: 在7个基准测试中，高维数据集上表现显著提升：电力数据集MSE降低20.9%，天气数据提升4.3%，交通数据提升2.7%，在低维ETT数据集上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: InvDec的优势随数据集维度增加而增长，证实了随着变量数量增加，跨变量建模变得至关重要。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting requires simultaneously modeling
temporal patterns and cross-variate dependencies. Channel-independent methods
such as PatchTST excel at temporal modeling but ignore variable correlations,
while pure variate-attention approaches such as iTransformer sacrifice temporal
encoding. We proposeInvDec (Inverted Decoder), a hybrid architecture that
achieves principled separation between temporal encoding and variate-level
decoding. InvDec combines a patch-based temporal encoder with an inverted
decoder operating on the variate dimension through variate-wise self-attention.
We introduce delayed variate embeddings that enrich variable-specific
representations only after temporal encoding, preserving temporal feature
integrity. An adaptive residual fusion mechanism dynamically balances temporal
and variate information across datasets of varying dimensions. Instantiating
InvDec with PatchTST yields InvDec-PatchTST. Extensive experiments on seven
benchmarks demonstrate significant gains on high-dimensional datasets: 20.9%
MSE reduction on Electricity (321 variables), 4.3% improvement on Weather, and
2.7% gain on Traffic compared to PatchTST, while maintaining competitive
performance on low-dimensional ETT datasets. Ablation studies validate each
component, and analysis reveals that InvDec's advantage grows with dataset
dimensionality, confirming that cross-variate modeling becomes critical as the
number of variables increases.

TL;DR: 提出了LEGO框架，用于推荐系统中的多属性遗忘，解决现有单属性遗忘方法无法同时处理多个遗忘请求和适应动态遗忘需求的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的隐私保护需求通常涉及多个敏感属性且具有动态性，现有单属性遗忘方法无法满足这些需求。

Method: 将多属性遗忘过程分为两个步骤：嵌入校准（从用户嵌入中移除特定属性信息）和灵活组合（将这些嵌入组合成单个嵌入以保护所有敏感属性），并将遗忘过程构建为互信息最小化问题。

Result: 在三个真实世界数据集和三种代表性推荐模型上的广泛实验证明了该框架的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: LEGO框架能够有效解决多属性遗忘问题，具有理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: With the growing demand for safeguarding sensitive user information in
recommender systems, recommendation attribute unlearning is receiving
increasing attention. Existing studies predominantly focus on single-attribute
unlearning. However, privacy protection requirements in the real world often
involve multiple sensitive attributes and are dynamic. Existing
single-attribute unlearning methods cannot meet these real-world requirements
due to i) CH1: the inability to handle multiple unlearning requests
simultaneously, and ii) CH2: the lack of efficient adaptability to dynamic
unlearning needs. To address these challenges, we propose LEGO, a lightweight
and efficient multiple-attribute unlearning framework. Specifically, we divide
the multiple-attribute unlearning process into two steps: i) Embedding
Calibration removes information related to a specific attribute from user
embedding, and ii) Flexible Combination combines these embeddings into a single
embedding, protecting all sensitive attributes. We frame the unlearning process
as a mutual information minimization problem, providing LEGO a theoretical
guarantee of simultaneous unlearning, thereby addressing CH1. With the two-step
framework, where Embedding Calibration can be performed in parallel and
Flexible Combination is flexible and efficient, we address CH2. Extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets across three representative
recommendation models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our
proposed framework. Our code and appendix are available at

Conclusion: 通过控制图像生成和集成真实与合成数据，可以有效地训练准确的跑道检测模型，特别是在数据稀缺的关键应用中。

Abstract: Deep vision models are now mature enough to be integrated in industrial and
possibly critical applications such as autonomous navigation. Yet, data
collection and labeling to train such models requires too much efforts and
costs for a single company or product. This drawback is more significant in
critical applications, where training data must include all possible conditions
including rare scenarios. In this perspective, generating synthetic images is
an appealing solution, since it allows a cheap yet reliable covering of all the
conditions and environments, if the impact of the synthetic-to-real
distribution shift is mitigated. In this article, we consider the case of
runway detection that is a critical part in autonomous landing systems
developed by aircraft manufacturers. We propose an image generation approach
based on a commercial flight simulator that complements a few annotated real
images. By controlling the image generation and the integration of real and
synthetic data, we show that standard object detection models can achieve
accurate prediction. We also evaluate their robustness with respect to adverse
conditions, in our case nighttime images, that were not represented in the real
data, and show the interest of using a customized domain adaptation strategy.

Conclusion: 提出的不确定性路由框架能够高效结合快速奖励模型和强大LLM评判器，为在线RLHF提供了一种成本效益高的解决方案。

Abstract: Reward model (RM) plays a pivotal role in reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, classical
RMs trained on human preferences are vulnerable to reward hacking and
generalize poorly to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. By contrast, strong LLM
judges equipped with reasoning capabilities demonstrate superior
generalization, even without additional training, but incur significantly
higher inference costs, limiting their applicability in online RLHF. In this
work, we propose an uncertainty-based routing framework that efficiently
complements a fast RM with a strong but costly LLM judge. Our approach
formulates advantage estimation in policy gradient (PG) methods as pairwise
preference classification, enabling principled uncertainty quantification to
guide routing. Uncertain pairs are forwarded to the LLM judge, while confident
ones are evaluated by the RM. Experiments on RM benchmarks demonstrate that our
uncertainty-based routing strategy significantly outperforms random judge
calling at the same cost, and downstream alignment results showcase its
effectiveness in improving online RLHF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有层次预测方法需要估计预测误差的协方差矩阵，但真实协方差矩阵未知，估计误差会降低预测性能。

Method: 引入协方差矩阵的不确定性集合，构建鲁棒优化框架，将协调问题转化为半定优化问题。

Result: 数值实验表明，所提出的鲁棒协调方法比现有层次预测方法具有更好的预测性能。

Conclusion: 在协调过程中考虑不确定性可以有效提升层次时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: This paper focuses on forecasting hierarchical time-series data, where each
higher-level observation equals the sum of its corresponding lower-level time
series. In such contexts, the forecast values should be coherent, meaning that
the forecast value of each parent series exactly matches the sum of the
forecast values of its child series. Existing hierarchical forecasting methods
typically generate base forecasts independently for each series and then apply
a reconciliation procedure to adjust them so that the resulting forecast values
are coherent across the hierarchy. These methods generally derive an optimal
reconciliation, using a covariance matrix of the forecast error. In practice,
however, the true covariance matrix is unknown and has to be estimated from
finite samples in advance. This gap between the true and estimated covariance
matrix may degrade forecast performance. To address this issue, we propose a
robust optimization framework for hierarchical reconciliation that accounts for
uncertainty in the estimated covariance matrix. We first introduce an
uncertainty set for the estimated covariance matrix and formulate a
reconciliation problem that minimizes the worst-case expected squared error
over this uncertainty set. We show that our problem can be cast as a
semidefinite optimization problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the
proposed robust reconciliation method achieved better forecast performance than
existing hierarchical forecasting methods, which indicates the effectiveness of
integrating uncertainty into the reconciliation process.

TL;DR: 提出了基于相对排序的缩放定律，通过RBP指标衡量正确token在预测中的排名概率，补充了传统交叉熵指标的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缩放定律研究主要依赖交叉熵指标，但交叉熵只关注正确token的绝对概率，忽略了正确与错误token的相对排序，而相对排序在语言模型中至关重要。

Method: 提出相对概率(RBP)指标，量化正确token在前k个预测中的概率，并基于此建立相对缩放定律，通过四个数据集和四个模型家族的实验验证。

Result: 实验证明相对缩放定律具有鲁棒性和准确性，能够更好地解释涌现现象并帮助寻找缩放定律的基础理论。

Conclusion: 相对缩放定律补充了交叉熵视角，为大规模语言模型的开发和理论探索提供了更全面的理解。

Abstract: Scaling laws aim to accurately predict model performance across different
scales. Existing scaling-law studies almost exclusively rely on cross-entropy
as the evaluation metric. However, cross-entropy provides only a partial view
of performance: it measures the absolute probability assigned to the correct
token, but ignores the relative ordering between correct and incorrect tokens.
Yet, relative ordering is crucial for language models, such as in
greedy-sampling scenario. To address this limitation, we investigate scaling
from the perspective of relative ordering. We first propose the Relative-Based
Probability (RBP) metric, which quantifies the probability that the correct
token is ranked among the top predictions. Building on this metric, we
establish the Relative-Based Scaling Law, which characterizes how RBP improves
with increasing model size. Through extensive experiments on four datasets and
four model families spanning five orders of magnitude, we demonstrate the
robustness and accuracy of this law. Finally, we illustrate the broad
application of this law with two examples, namely providing a deeper
explanation of emergence phenomena and facilitating finding fundamental
theories of scaling laws. In summary, the Relative-Based Scaling Law
complements the cross-entropy perspective and contributes to a more complete
understanding of scaling large language models. Thus, it offers valuable
insights for both practical development and theoretical exploration.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个工业启发的基准环境，将排序和压缩操作结合成顺序回收场景，评估模块化和整体控制策略，发现动作掩码对性能提升至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业过程需要局部专业化和全局协调，但强化学习在工业应用中的采用受到奖励设计、模块化和动作空间管理等挑战的限制，现有学术基准与工业控制问题差异较大。

Method: 结合SortingEnv和ContainerGym两个现有基准，创建顺序回收场景，评估模块化架构（专用代理）和整体架构（单一代理），分析动作掩码的影响。

Result: 无动作掩码时，代理难以学习有效策略，模块化架构表现更好；应用动作掩码后，两种架构性能显著提升，性能差距缩小。

Conclusion: 动作空间约束具有决定性作用，专业化优势随动作复杂度降低而减弱，该基准为工业自动化中多代理强化学习解决方案提供了有价值的测试平台。

Abstract: Autonomous control of multi-stage industrial processes requires both local
specialization and global coordination. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a
promising approach, but its industrial adoption remains limited due to
challenges such as reward design, modularity, and action space management. Many
academic benchmarks differ markedly from industrial control problems, limiting
their transferability to real-world applications. This study introduces an
enhanced industry-inspired benchmark environment that combines tasks from two
existing benchmarks, SortingEnv and ContainerGym, into a sequential recycling
scenario with sorting and pressing operations. We evaluate two control
strategies: a modular architecture with specialized agents and a monolithic
agent governing the full system, while also analyzing the impact of action
masking. Our experiments show that without action masking, agents struggle to
learn effective policies, with the modular architecture performing better. When
action masking is applied, both architectures improve substantially, and the
performance gap narrows considerably. These results highlight the decisive role
of action space constraints and suggest that the advantages of specialization
diminish as action complexity is reduced. The proposed benchmark thus provides
a valuable testbed for exploring practical and robust multi-agent RL solutions
in industrial automation, while contributing to the ongoing debate on
centralization versus specialization.

TL;DR: 本文分析了DPO算法的局限性，指出当真实奖励函数无法通过策略类实现时，DPO会出现错误设定问题，导致偏好顺序反转等失败模式。作者提出了AuxDPO方法，通过引入辅助变量来缓解DPO的错误设定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO算法虽然简化了RLHF过程，但在真实奖励函数无法通过策略类实现时会出现错误设定问题，导致性能下降。需要一种能够缓解这种错误设定的改进方法。

Method: 分析了DPO的统计估计问题，研究了RLHF的局部行为，提出了AuxDPO方法，在DPO损失函数中引入辅助变量来更好地逼近RLHF解。

Result: 在理论分析和实验验证中，AuxDPO在didactic bandit设置和LLM对齐任务上都表现出优于DPO的性能。

Conclusion: AuxDPO通过引入辅助变量有效缓解了DPO的错误设定问题，在理论和实验上都证明了其优越性，为直接对齐算法提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Direct alignment algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
fine-tune models based on preference data, using only supervised learning
instead of two-stage reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). We show
that DPO encodes a statistical estimation problem over reward functions induced
by a parametric policy class. When the true reward function that generates
preferences cannot be realized via the policy class, DPO becomes misspecified,
resulting in failure modes such as preference order reversal, worsening of
policy reward, and high sensitivity to the input preference data distribution.
On the other hand, we study the local behavior of two-stage RLHF for a
parametric class and relate it to a natural gradient step in policy space. Our
fine-grained geometric characterization allows us to propose AuxDPO, which
introduces additional auxiliary variables in the DPO loss function to help move
towards the RLHF solution in a principled manner and mitigate the
misspecification in DPO. We empirically demonstrate the superior performance of
AuxDPO on didactic bandit settings as well as LLM alignment tasks.

Motivation: 现实应用中事件标记分布高度不平衡，现有研究忽视了这一挑战，导致对稀有标记事件的预测性能不佳。

Method: 提出阈值方法来学习调整标记概率，先预测标记再预测时间；开发新的神经MTPP模型支持有效时间采样和标记概率估计，避免计算昂贵的数值积分。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在下一事件标记和时间预测方面优于各种基线方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的解决方案通过阈值调整和新的神经网络架构，有效解决了事件标记不平衡问题，显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) has been well studied to model the event
distribution in marked event streams, which can be used to predict the mark and
arrival time of the next event. However, existing studies overlook that the
distribution of event marks is highly imbalanced in many real-world
applications, with some marks being frequent but others rare. The imbalance
poses a significant challenge to the performance of the next event prediction,
especially for events of rare marks. To address this issue, we propose a
thresholding method, which learns thresholds to tune the mark probability
normalized by the mark's prior probability to optimize mark prediction, rather
than predicting the mark directly based on the mark probability as in existing
studies. In conjunction with this method, we predict the mark first and then
the time. In particular, we develop a novel neural MTPP model to support
effective time sampling and estimation of mark probability without
computationally expensive numerical improper integration. Extensive experiments
on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our solution
against various baselines for the next event mark and time prediction. The code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在真实系统中部署时会产生有毒或有偏见的输出，影响安全性和可信度。参数更新的高成本促使需要选择性使用修复数据，但现有数据选择方法在大型生成模型的行为修复中的效果尚不明确。

Method: 评估了五种代表性选择方法：随机采样、K-Center、基于梯度范数的选择(GraNd)、分层覆盖(CCS)以及提出的语义感知优先采样(SAPS)。通过毒性降低、WikiText-2和LAMBADA上的困惑度以及三个复合指标评估修复效果。

Result: SAPS在解毒、效用保持和效率方面达到最佳平衡，用更少数据实现相当或更好的修复效果。随机采样对大型或鲁棒模型仍然有效，而CCS和GraNd等高开销方法收益有限。最优数据比例取决于模型规模和修复方法。

Conclusion: 选择式修复是维护LLM可靠性的高效可扩展范式，样本选择应被视为修复流程中的可调组件。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems,
yet they can produce toxic or biased outputs that undermine safety and trust.
Post-hoc model repair provides a practical remedy, but the high cost of
parameter updates motivates selective use of repair data. Despite extensive
prior work on data selection for model training, it remains unclear which
sampling criteria are most effective and efficient when applied specifically to
behavioral repair of large generative models. Our study presents a systematic
analysis of sample prioritization strategies for LLM repair. We evaluate five
representative selection methods, including random sampling, K-Center,
gradient-norm-based selection(GraNd), stratified coverage (CCS), and a
Semantic-Aware Prioritized Sampling (SAPS) approach we proposed. Repair
effectiveness and trade-offs are assessed through toxicity reduction,
perplexity on WikiText-2 and LAMBADA, and three composite metrics: the Repair
Proximity Score (RPS), the Overall Performance Score (OPS), and the Repair
Efficiency Score (RES). Experimental results show that SAPS achieves the best
balance between detoxification, utility preservation, and efficiency,
delivering comparable or superior repair outcomes with substantially less data.
Random sampling remains effective for large or robust models, while
high-overhead methods such as CCS and GraNd provide limited benefit. The
optimal data proportion depends on model scale and repair method, indicating
that sample selection should be regarded as a tunable component of repair
pipelines. Overall, these findings establish selection-based repair as an
efficient and scalable paradigm for maintaining LLM reliability.

Abstract: Evaluating competing systems in a comparable way, i.e., benchmarking them, is
an undeniable pillar of the scientific method. However, system performance is
often summarized via a small number of metrics. The analysis of the evaluation
details and the derivation of insights for further development or use remains a
tedious manual task with often biased results. Thus, this paper argues for a
new type of benchmarking, which is dubbed explainable benchmarking. The aim of
explainable benchmarking approaches is to automatically generate explanations
for the performance of systems in a benchmark. We provide a first instantiation
of this paradigm for knowledge-graph-based question answering systems. We
compute explanations by using a novel concept learning approach developed for
large knowledge graphs called PruneCEL. Our evaluation shows that PruneCEL
outperforms state-of-the-art concept learners on the task of explainable
benchmarking by up to 0.55 points F1 measure. A task-driven user study with 41
participants shows that in 80\% of the cases, the majority of participants can
accurately predict the behavior of a system based on our explanations. Our code

Abstract: Drug combinations offer therapeutic benefits but also carry the risk of
adverse drug-drug interactions (DDIs), especially under complex molecular
structures. Accurate DDI event prediction requires capturing fine-grained
inter-drug relationships, which are critical for modeling metabolic mechanisms
such as enzyme-mediated competition. However, existing approaches typically
rely on isolated drug representations and fail to explicitly model atom-level
cross-molecular interactions, limiting their effectiveness across diverse
molecular complexities and DDI type distributions. To address these
limitations, we propose MolBridge, a novel atom-level joint graph refinement
framework for robust DDI event prediction. MolBridge constructs a joint graph
that integrates atomic structures of drug pairs, enabling direct modeling of
inter-drug associations. A central challenge in such joint graph settings is
the potential loss of information caused by over-smoothing when modeling
long-range atomic dependencies. To overcome this, we introduce a structure
consistency module that iteratively refines node features while preserving the
global structural context. This joint design allows MolBridge to effectively
learn both local and global interaction outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving superior performance across long-tail and inductive scenarios.
patterns, yielding robust representations across both frequent and rare DDI
types. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that MolBridge
consistently. These results demonstrate the advantages of fine-grained graph
refinement in improving the accuracy, robustness, and mechanistic
interpretability of DDI event prediction.This work contributes to Web Mining
and Content Analysis by developing graph-based methods for mining and analyzing

Abstract: Intransitive player dominance, where player A beats B, B beats C, but C beats
A, is common in competitive tennis. Yet, there are few known attempts to
incorporate it within forecasting methods. We address this problem with a graph
neural network approach that explicitly models these intransitive relationships
through temporal directed graphs, with players as nodes and their historical
match outcomes as directed edges. We find the bookmaker Pinnacle Sports poorly
handles matches with high intransitive complexity and posit that our
graph-based approach is uniquely positioned to capture relational dynamics in
these scenarios. When selectively betting on higher intransitivity matchups
with our model (65.7% accuracy, 0.215 Brier Score), we achieve significant
positive returns of 3.26% ROI with Kelly staking over 1903 bets, suggesting a
market inefficiency in handling intransitive matchups that our approach
successfully exploits.

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in interest in digital content watermarking
techniques, driven by the proliferation of generative models and increased
legal pressure. With an ever-growing percentage of AI-generated content
available online, watermarking plays an increasingly important role in ensuring
content authenticity and attribution at scale. There have been many works
assessing the robustness of watermarking to removal attacks, yet, watermark
forging, the scenario when a watermark is stolen from genuine content and
applied to malicious content, remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate watermark forging in the context of widely used post-hoc image
watermarking. Our contributions are as follows. First, we introduce a
preference model to assess whether an image is watermarked. The model is
trained using a ranking loss on purely procedurally generated images without
any need for real watermarks. Second, we demonstrate the model's capability to
remove and forge watermarks by optimizing the input image through
backpropagation. This technique requires only a single watermarked image and
works without knowledge of the watermarking model, making our attack much
simpler and more practical than attacks introduced in related work. Third, we
evaluate our proposed method on a variety of post-hoc image watermarking
models, demonstrating that our approach can effectively forge watermarks,
questioning the security of current watermarking approaches. Our code and
further resources are publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出Bi-CoG方法，通过同时利用模型间和模型内一致性，结合错误感知动态伪标签分配策略，解决半监督微调中的模型偏差和超参数敏感性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督微调方法依赖预测一致性或预定义置信度阈值，容易产生模型偏差和超参数敏感性，需要更有效的伪标签分配策略。

Method: Bi-CoG方法利用模型间和模型内一致性，结合错误感知动态伪标签分配策略，为未标记数据分配高质量、低偏差的伪标签。

Result: 在14个数据集上的广泛实验表明，Bi-CoG能持续显著提升现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: Bi-CoG是一种简单有效的即插即用方法，通过双一致性引导和动态伪标签分配，显著改善了半监督微调的性能。

Abstract: Exploiting unlabeled data through semi-supervised learning (SSL) or
leveraging pre-trained models via fine-tuning are two prevailing paradigms for
addressing label-scarce scenarios. Recently, growing attention has been given
to combining fine-tuning of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) with SSL,
forming the emerging paradigm of semi-supervised fine-tuning. However, existing
methods often suffer from model bias and hyperparameter sensitivity, due to
reliance on prediction consistency or pre-defined confidence thresholds. To
address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective plug-and-play
methodology named
$\underline{\textbf{Bi-Co}}$nsistency-$\underline{\textbf{G}}$uided
Self-Training (Bi-CoG), which assigns high-quality and low-bias pseudo-labels,
by simultaneously exploiting inter-model and intra-model consistency, along
with an error-aware dynamic pseudo-label assignment strategy. Both theoretical
analysis and extensive experiments over 14 datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Bi-CoG, which consistently and significantly improves the
performance of existing methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Hurdle-IMDL框架解决遥感降雨反演中的标签不平衡问题，通过分解零膨胀和长尾分布，有效改善对强降雨的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能在定量遥感中面临标签分布不平衡的挑战，传统训练模型偏向常见样本，导致对罕见样本（如强降雨）的检索性能下降。

Method: 采用分治策略，将降雨分布不平衡分解为零膨胀（非降雨样本占主导）和长尾分布（轻降雨样本远多于强降雨样本）。使用hurdle模型处理零膨胀，提出IMDL方法通过将学习目标转化为无偏理想逆模型来解决长尾问题。

Result: 通过统计指标和案例研究验证，Hurdle-IMDL优于传统方法、成本敏感方法、生成方法和多任务学习方法，有效缓解系统低估问题，显著改善强到极端降雨的检索性能。

Conclusion: IMDL为处理环境变量分布不平衡提供了通用方法，能够增强对罕见但高影响事件的检索能力。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced quantitative remote sensing, yet its
effectiveness is constrained by imbalanced label distribution. This imbalance
leads conventionally trained models to favor common samples, which in turn
degrades retrieval performance for rare ones. Rainfall retrieval exemplifies
this issue, with performance particularly compromised for heavy rain. This
study proposes Hurdle-Inversion Model Debiasing Learning (IMDL) framework.
Following a divide-and-conquer strategy, imbalance in the rain distribution is
decomposed into two components: zero inflation, defined by the predominance of
non-rain samples; and long tail, defined by the disproportionate abundance of
light-rain samples relative to heavy-rain samples. A hurdle model is adopted to
handle the zero inflation, while IMDL is proposed to address the long tail by
transforming the learning object into an unbiased ideal inverse model.
Comprehensive evaluation via statistical metrics and case studies investigating
rainy weather in eastern China confirms Hurdle-IMDL's superiority over
conventional, cost-sensitive, generative, and multi-task learning methods. Its
key advancements include effective mitigation of systematic underestimation and
a marked improvement in the retrieval of heavy-to-extreme rain. IMDL offers a
generalizable approach for addressing imbalance in distributions of
environmental variables, enabling enhanced retrieval of rare yet high-impact
events.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SheafAlign是一个基于层论的分散式多模态对齐框架，用多个比较空间替代单一空间对齐，通过层结构建模模态间关系，使用分散对比学习目标进行训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态对齐方法假设所有模态间存在相互冗余性，这在现实分布式场景中不成立。需要一种不要求所有模态相互冗余的分散式对齐方法。

Method: 提出SheafAlign框架，使用层论方法在多个比较空间中进行对齐，通过层结构建模成对模态关系，采用分散对比学习目标进行训练。

Result: 在多模态传感数据集上的实验显示，该方法在零样本泛化、跨模态对齐和模态缺失鲁棒性方面表现优异，通信成本比现有最优基线降低50%。

Conclusion: SheafAlign克服了现有方法的限制，不需要所有模态间相互冗余，能够同时保留共享和独特信息，在分散式多模态对齐中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Conventional multimodal alignment methods assume mutual redundancy across all
modalities, an assumption that fails in real-world distributed scenarios. We
propose SheafAlign, a sheaf-theoretic framework for decentralized multimodal
alignment that replaces single-space alignment with multiple comparison spaces.
This approach models pairwise modality relations through sheaf structures and
leverages decentralized contrastive learning-based objectives for training.
SheafAlign overcomes the limitations of prior methods by not requiring mutual
redundancy among all modalities, preserving both shared and unique information.
Experiments on multimodal sensing datasets show superior zero-shot
generalization, cross-modal alignment, and robustness to missing modalities,
with 50\% lower communication cost than state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: 该框架为零样本RL研究提供了原则性基础，为开发更通用智能体指明了清晰路径，有助于推动该领域的系统化发展。

Abstract: Zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a setting for developing
general agents in an unsupervised manner, capable of solving downstream tasks
without additional training or planning at test-time. Unlike conventional RL,
which optimizes policies for a fixed reward, zero-shot RL requires agents to
encode representations rich enough to support immediate adaptation to any
objective, drawing parallels to vision and language foundation models. Despite
growing interest, the field lacks a common analytical lens.
  We present the first unified framework for zero-shot RL. Our formulation
introduces a consistent notation and taxonomy that organizes existing
approaches and allows direct comparison between them. Central to our framework
is the classification of algorithms into two families: direct representations,
which learn end-to-end mappings from rewards to policies, and compositional
representations, which decompose the representation leveraging the substructure
of the value function. Within this framework, we highlight shared principles
and key differences across methods, and we derive an extended bound for
successor-feature methods, offering a new perspective on their performance in
the zero-shot regime. By consolidating existing work under a common lens, our
framework provides a principled foundation for future research in zero-shot RL
and outlines a clear path toward developing more general agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图重布线技术虽然能缓解图神经网络中的过度压缩问题，但会改变图拓扑结构，可能扭曲重要的拓扑依赖信号。目前尚不清楚需要保留哪些结构属性才能确保性能提升和结构保真度。

Method: 研究了七种不同的重布线策略，并将局部和全局图属性的变化与节点分类准确性相关联。

Result: 结果显示成功的重布线方法倾向于保留局部结构，同时在全局连接性上允许灵活性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为设计有效的重布线策略提供了新见解，弥合了图理论与实际GNN优化之间的差距。

Abstract: Graph rewiring has emerged as a key technique to alleviate over-squashing in
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers by modifying the graph
topology to improve information flow. While effective, rewiring inherently
alters the graph's structure, raising the risk of distorting important
topology-dependent signals. Yet, despite the growing use of rewiring, little is
known about which structural properties must be preserved to ensure both
performance gains and structural fidelity. In this work, we provide the first
systematic analysis of how rewiring affects a range of graph structural
metrics, and how these changes relate to downstream task performance. We study
seven diverse rewiring strategies and correlate changes in local and global
graph properties with node classification accuracy. Our results reveal a
consistent pattern: successful rewiring methods tend to preserve local
structure while allowing for flexibility in global connectivity. These findings
offer new insights into the design of effective rewiring strategies, bridging
the gap between graph theory and practical GNN optimization.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了将MLOps实践集成到运营技术(OT)系统中的挑战，提出了基于现有OT参考模型(如RAMI 4.0和ISA-95)的系统性集成方法，并通过实际用例验证了该方法的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着MLOps在工业环境中的广泛应用，其与OT系统的集成面临显著挑战，需要找到有效的集成路径。

Method: 分析MLOps与OT集成的根本障碍，评估RAMI 4.0和ISA-95标准对MLOps的适用性，并将MLOps生命周期组件映射到RAMI 4.0框架中。

Result: 研究发现标准MLOps实践不能直接移植到OT环境，但通过使用现有参考模型进行结构化适配，可以成功实现集成。

Conclusion: 通过基于现有OT参考模型的系统性方法，可以为MLOps与OT环境的成功集成提供可行路径。

Abstract: Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) practices are increas- ingly adopted in
industrial settings, yet their integration with Opera- tional Technology (OT)
systems presents significant challenges. This pa- per analyzes the fundamental
obstacles in combining MLOps with OT en- vironments and proposes a systematic
approach to embed MLOps prac- tices into established OT reference models. We
evaluate the suitability of the Reference Architectural Model for Industry 4.0
(RAMI 4.0) and the International Society of Automation Standard 95 (ISA-95) for
MLOps integration and present a detailed mapping of MLOps lifecycle compo-
nents to RAMI 4.0 exemplified by a real-world use case. Our findings
demonstrate that while standard MLOps practices cannot be directly transplanted
to OT environments, structured adaptation using existing reference models can
provide a pathway for successful integration.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BadGraph是针对文本引导图生成的潜在扩散模型的隐蔽后门攻击方法，通过文本触发器植入指定子图，在少量投毒数据下即可实现高攻击成功率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图生成技术的快速发展带来了新的安全担忧，特别是后门漏洞。虽然先前工作探索了图像扩散和无条件图生成中的后门攻击，但条件性特别是文本引导的图生成仍未被充分研究

Method: BadGraph利用文本触发器投毒训练数据，在VAE和扩散训练阶段隐蔽植入后门，当推理时出现触发器时诱导攻击者指定的子图，同时保持对干净输入的正常性能

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，不到10%的投毒率即可达到50%攻击成功率，24%投毒率可实现超过80%成功率，且对良性样本的性能影响可忽略

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了文本引导图生成的潜在扩散模型中的安全漏洞，突显了在药物发现等应用中的严重风险，并强调需要对此类扩散模型中的后门攻击进行鲁棒防御

Abstract: The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns,
particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored
backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation,
conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely
unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting
latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages
textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that
induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear,
while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the
effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can
achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate,
with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies
further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training
rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in
latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious
risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need
for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.

Motivation: 现有端到端推理模型在训练分布之外泛化能力有限，需要一种能够处理比训练时更复杂问题的推理方法。

Method: 学习子问题的能量景观，在测试时组合多个子问题的能量函数构建全局能量景观，并使用并行能量最小化技术。

Result: 在多种推理问题上超越现有最先进方法，能够泛化到更大更复杂的问题。

Conclusion: 通过组合子问题能量景观的方法有效提升了推理模型的泛化能力，为处理复杂推理问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Generalization is a key challenge in machine learning, specifically in
reasoning tasks, where models are expected to solve problems more complex than
those encountered during training. Existing approaches typically train
reasoning models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping input instances to
solutions. While this allows models to learn useful heuristics from data, it
often results in limited generalization beyond the training distribution. In
this work, we propose a novel approach to reasoning generalization by learning
energy landscapes over the solution spaces of smaller, more tractable
subproblems. At test time, we construct a global energy landscape for a given
problem by combining the energy functions of multiple subproblems. This
compositional approach enables the incorporation of additional constraints
during inference, allowing the construction of energy landscapes for problems
of increasing difficulty. To improve the sample quality from this newly
constructed energy landscape, we introduce Parallel Energy Minimization (PEM).
We evaluate our approach on a wide set of reasoning problems. Our method
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its ability to
generalize to larger and more complex problems. Project website can be found

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种快速、无需微调的LLM适配方法，通过选择性矩阵降维和梯度分析，在仅使用100个样本的情况下实现下游任务适配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LASER方法虽然能提升下游任务准确率，但其逐层搜索和全数据集前向传播的计算开销过大，难以快速部署。

Method: 使用梯度分析确定需要降维的矩阵子集，扩展分解搜索空间允许矩阵行围绕多个子空间聚类，并在仅100个样本上计算梯度和评估准确率。

Result: 方法显著减少搜索时间，进一步减少原始训练数据的过拟合，准确率提升最高达24.6个百分点。

Conclusion: 结合这些发现，开发出快速且鲁棒的下游任务适配算法，仅需单次梯度步和快速扫描即可实现LLM适配，完全无需微调。

Abstract: Recently, Sharma et al. suggested a method called Layer-SElective-Rank
reduction (LASER) which demonstrated that pruning high-order components of
carefully chosen LLM's weight matrices can boost downstream accuracy -- without
any gradient-based fine-tuning. Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each
requiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid
deployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)
Only a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --
eliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's
singular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the
factorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple
subspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces
overfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to
24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just
100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the
indicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to
further reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream
tasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show
that combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for
downstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a
quick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can
adapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典SGD分析依赖于过强(有界方差)或过粗糙(均匀噪声)的假设，期望平滑性条件提供了更灵活的替代方案，将随机梯度的二阶矩与目标函数值和全梯度联系起来。

Method: 在期望平滑性条件下进行SGD收敛性分析，改进ES条件的解释和采样相关常数，推导全梯度范数平方的期望界，分析不同步长策略。

Result: 证明了SGD在ES条件下具有O(1/K)的收敛率，并给出了显式的残差误差表达式，统一并扩展了近期相关工作。

Conclusion: 期望平滑性条件为SGD收敛分析提供了更灵活的理论框架，本文的分析统一并扩展了该领域的最新进展，为大规模学习提供了更坚实的理论基础。

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the workhorse of large-scale learning,
yet classical analyses rely on assumptions that can be either too strong
(bounded variance) or too coarse (uniform noise). The expected smoothness (ES)
condition has emerged as a flexible alternative that ties the second moment of
stochastic gradients to the objective value and the full gradient. This paper
presents a self-contained convergence analysis of SGD under ES. We (i) refine
ES with interpretations and sampling-dependent constants; (ii) derive bounds of
the expectation of squared full gradient norm; and (iii) prove $O(1/K)$ rates
with explicit residual errors for various step-size schedules. All proofs are
given in full detail in the appendix. Our treatment unifies and extends recent
threads (Khaled and Richt\'arik, 2020; Umeda and Iiduka, 2025).

Motivation: 研究在现实计算预算下，针对代码生成任务的检索设计，为构建有效的代码导向RAG系统提供基于证据的建议。

Method: 使用Long Code Arena中的代码补全和错误定位任务，系统比较不同上下文窗口大小下的检索配置，包括分块策略、相似性评分和分割粒度三个维度。

Result: 发现BM25+词级分割在PL-PL检索中最有效且实用；专有密集编码器在NL-PL检索中表现更好但延迟高100倍；最佳块大小随上下文窗口变化；基于行的分块与语法感知分割效果相当；检索延迟差异可达200倍。

Conclusion: 为基于任务需求、模型约束和计算效率实现有效的代码导向RAG系统提供了基于证据的推荐配置。

Abstract: We study retrieval design for code-focused generation tasks under realistic
compute budgets. Using two complementary tasks from Long Code Arena -- code
completion and bug localization -- we systematically compare retrieval
configurations across various context window sizes along three axes: (i)
chunking strategy, (ii) similarity scoring, and (iii) splitting granularity.
(1) For PL-PL, sparse BM25 with word-level splitting is the most effective and
practical, significantly outperforming dense alternatives while being an order
of magnitude faster. (2) For NL-PL, proprietary dense encoders (Voyager-3
family) consistently beat sparse retrievers, however requiring 100x larger
latency. (3) Optimal chunk size scales with available context: 32-64 line
chunks work best at small budgets, and whole-file retrieval becomes competitive
at 16000 tokens. (4) Simple line-based chunking matches syntax-aware splitting
across budgets. (5) Retrieval latency varies by up to 200x across
configurations; BPE-based splitting is needlessly slow, and BM25 + word
splitting offers the best quality-latency trade-off. Thus, we provide
evidence-based recommendations for implementing effective code-oriented RAG
systems based on task requirements, model constraints, and computational
efficiency.

Abstract: Breast cancer is considered the most critical and frequently diagnosed cancer
in women worldwide, leading to an increase in cancer-related mortality. Early
and accurate detection is crucial as it can help mitigate possible threats
while improving survival rates. In terms of prediction, conventional diagnostic
methods are often limited by variability, cost, and, most importantly, risk of
misdiagnosis. To address these challenges, machine learning (ML) has emerged as
a powerful tool for computer-aided diagnosis, with feature selection playing a
vital role in improving model performance and interpretability. This research
study proposes an integrated framework that incorporates customized Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) for feature selection. This framework has been
evaluated on a comprehensive set of 29 different models, spanning classical
classifiers, ensemble techniques, neural networks, probabilistic algorithms,
and instance-based algorithms. To ensure interpretability and clinical
relevance, the study uses cross-validation in conjunction with explainable AI
methods. Experimental evaluation showed that the proposed approach achieved a
superior score of 99.1\% across all performance metrics, including accuracy and
precision, while effectively reducing dimensionality and providing transparent,
model-agnostic explanations. The results highlight the potential of combining
swarm intelligence with explainable ML for robust, trustworthy, and clinically
meaningful breast cancer diagnosis.

Conclusion: MS-BART通过统一建模和大规模预训练有效解决了质谱结构解析中的数据稀缺问题，结合化学反馈机制显著提升了分子生成的准确性，为质谱分析提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Mass spectrometry (MS) plays a critical role in molecular identification,
significantly advancing scientific discovery. However, structure elucidation
from MS data remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated spectra.
While large-scale pretraining has proven effective in addressing data scarcity
in other domains, applying this paradigm to mass spectrometry is hindered by
the complexity and heterogeneity of raw spectral signals. To address this, we
propose MS-BART, a unified modeling framework that maps mass spectra and
molecular structures into a shared token vocabulary, enabling cross-modal
learning through large-scale pretraining on reliably computed
fingerprint-molecule datasets. Multi-task pretraining objectives further
enhance MS-BART's generalization by jointly optimizing denoising and
translation task. The pretrained model is subsequently transferred to
experimental spectra through finetuning on fingerprint predictions generated
with MIST, a pre-trained spectral inference model, thereby enhancing robustness
to real-world spectral variability. While finetuning alleviates the
distributional difference, MS-BART still suffers molecular hallucination and
requires further alignment. We therefore introduce a chemical feedback

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了差分隐私迁移学习中的两个关键超参数：裁剪边界C和批次大小B。研究发现现有理论（强隐私需要更小的C）与实证结果（强隐私下更大的C表现更好）存在不匹配，并揭示了现有批次大小调优启发式方法失效的原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前差分隐私迁移学习（即对预训练模型在私有数据上进行微调）是大模型隐私保护训练的最先进方法。然而，对于关键超参数C和B的选择，理论理解与实证结果存在明显脱节，需要深入分析这种不匹配的原因。

Method: 通过分析梯度分布变化，研究裁剪边界C对性能的影响；在有限计算预算下，检验批次大小B的调优启发式方法，并分析累积DP噪声的作用；探讨跨任务使用单一(C,B)设置的局限性。

Result: 发现强隐私约束下，更大的裁剪边界C反而表现更好，这与现有理论相悖；现有批次大小调优启发式方法失效，而累积DP噪声能更好解释批次大小选择；跨任务使用单一(C,B)设置会导致性能下降，特别是在隐私约束松紧和计算资源多少变化时。

Conclusion: 裁剪边界C的选择应考虑梯度分布变化，批次大小B的选择应关注累积DP噪声效应。跨任务使用固定的(C,B)设置会带来次优性能，需要根据具体隐私约束和计算资源进行调优。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning a pretrained
model on private data, is the current state-of-the-art approach for training
large models under privacy constraints. We focus on two key hyperparameters in
this setting: the clipping bound $C$ and batch size $B$. We show a clear
mismatch between the current theoretical understanding of how to choose an
optimal $C$ (stronger privacy requires smaller $C$) and empirical outcomes
(larger $C$ performs better under strong privacy), caused by changes in the
gradient distributions. Assuming a limited compute budget (fixed epochs), we
demonstrate that the existing heuristics for tuning $B$ do not work, while
cumulative DP noise better explains whether smaller or larger batches perform
better. We also highlight how the common practice of using a single $(C,B)$
setting across tasks can lead to suboptimal performance. We find that
performance drops especially when moving between loose and tight privacy and
between plentiful and limited compute, which we explain by analyzing clipping
as a form of gradient re-weighting and examining cumulative DP noise.

TL;DR: H-SPLID是一种通过将显著和非显著特征分解到不同空间来学习显著特征表示的新算法，能够促进学习低维、任务相关的特征，并建立鲁棒性与潜在表示压缩之间的联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在特征学习中对显著和非显著特征的区分不够明确，H-SPLID旨在通过显式分解来更好地学习任务相关的显著特征表示。

Method: H-SPLID算法将显著和非显著特征显式分解到不同的表示空间，利用Hilbert-Schmidt独立性准则(HSIC)建立输入扰动下的预测偏差与显著子空间维度之间的联系。

Result: 在图像分类任务上的实验表明，使用H-SPLID训练的模型主要依赖显著输入组件，对影响非显著特征（如图像背景）的扰动敏感性降低。

Conclusion: H-SPLID成功实现了显著特征的有效学习，建立了表示维度压缩与模型鲁棒性之间的理论联系，并在实践中验证了其对非显著扰动的鲁棒性。

Abstract: We introduce H-SPLID, a novel algorithm for learning salient feature
representations through the explicit decomposition of salient and non-salient
features into separate spaces. We show that H-SPLID promotes learning
low-dimensional, task-relevant features. We prove that the expected prediction
deviation under input perturbations is upper-bounded by the dimension of the
salient subspace and the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) between
inputs and representations. This establishes a link between robustness and
latent representation compression in terms of the dimensionality and
information preserved. Empirical evaluations on image classification tasks show
that models trained with H-SPLID primarily rely on salient input components, as
indicated by reduced sensitivity to perturbations affecting non-salient
features, such as image backgrounds. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种公平感知的生存建模方法FASM，旨在减轻生存分析中的算法偏见，特别是在组内和跨组风险排名方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在医疗保健中的应用日益增多，但临床数据中的结构性不平等和社会偏见可能被数据驱动模型延续甚至放大。在生存分析中，删失和时间动态进一步增加了公平模型开发的复杂性。

Method: 提出了公平感知生存建模(FASM)方法，专门设计用于减轻关于组内和跨组风险排名的算法偏见。使用乳腺癌预后作为代表性案例，并将FASM应用于SEER乳腺癌数据。

Result: FASM显著提高了公平性，同时保持了与未考虑公平性的生存模型相当的判别性能。时间分层评估显示FASM在10年范围内保持稳定的公平性，在随访中期观察到最大的改进。

Conclusion: 该方法使得生存模型能够在临床决策中同时优先考虑准确性和公平性，将公平性作为临床护理的核心原则推进。

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly integrated into healthcare,
structural inequities and social biases embedded in clinical data can be
perpetuated or even amplified by data-driven models. In survival analysis,
censoring and time dynamics can further add complexity to fair model
development. Additionally, algorithmic fairness approaches often overlook
disparities in cross-group rankings, e.g., high-risk Black patients may be
ranked below lower-risk White patients who do not experience the event of
mortality. Such misranking can reinforce biological essentialism and undermine
equitable care. We propose a Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM), designed
to mitigate algorithmic bias regarding both intra-group and cross-group risk
rankings over time. Using breast cancer prognosis as a representative case and
applying FASM to SEER breast cancer data, we show that FASM substantially
improves fairness while preserving discrimination performance comparable to
fairness-unaware survival models. Time-stratified evaluations show that FASM
maintains stable fairness over a 10-year horizon, with the greatest
improvements observed during the mid-term of follow-up. Our approach enables
the development of survival models that prioritize both accuracy and equity in
clinical decision-making, advancing fairness as a core principle in clinical
care.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved
unprecedented breakthrough, showcasing remarkable capabilities in natural
language understanding, generation, and complex reasoning. This transformative
potential has positioned them as key enablers for 6G autonomous communications
among machines, vehicles, and humanoids. In this article, we provide an
overview of task-oriented autonomous communications with LLMs/LMMs, focusing on
multimodal sensing integration, adaptive reconfiguration, and
prompt/fine-tuning strategies for wireless tasks. We demonstrate the framework
through three case studies: LMM-based traffic control, LLM-based robot

experimental results, we show that the proposed LLM/LMM-aided autonomous
systems significantly outperform conventional and discriminative deep learning
(DL) model-based techniques, maintaining robustness under dynamic objectives,
varying input parameters, and heterogeneous multimodal conditions where
conventional static optimization degrades.

Abstract: In this paper, we present DiRecGNN, an attention-enhanced entity
recommendation framework for monitoring cloud services at Microsoft. We provide
insights on the usefulness of this feature as perceived by the cloud service
owners and lessons learned from deployment. Specifically, we introduce the
problem of recommending the optimal subset of attributes (dimensions) that
should be tracked by an automated watchdog (monitor) for cloud services. To
begin, we construct the monitor heterogeneous graph at production-scale. The
interaction dynamics of these entities are often characterized by limited
structural and engagement information, resulting in inferior performance of
state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, traditional methods fail to capture the
dependencies between entities spanning a long range due to their homophilic
nature. Therefore, we propose an attention-enhanced entity ranking model
inspired by transformer architectures. Our model utilizes a multi-head
attention mechanism to focus on heterogeneous neighbors and their attributes,
and further attends to paths sampled using random walks to capture long-range
dependencies. We also employ multi-faceted loss functions to optimize for
relevant recommendations while respecting the inherent sparsity of the data.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over existing
methods, with our model achieving a 43.1% increase in MRR. Furthermore, product
teams who consumed these features perceive the feature as useful and rated it
4.5 out of 5.

TL;DR: 本文推导了一个新的、紧致的、可处理的KLD下界作为JSD的函数，证明了最大化JSD信息能增加互信息的保证下界，为基于互信息的表示学习提供了新的理论依据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然互信息是表示学习中的重要度量，但直接优化往往难以处理。许多方法转而最大化替代依赖度量如JSD，但这些代理目标与互信息的关系仍不清楚。

Method: 通过推导KLD作为JSD函数的紧致下界，并专门化到联合和边缘分布，同时通过二元分类器的交叉熵损失实现JSD目标的实践。

Result: 实验表明该下界在MI估计中紧致，相比现有变分下界神经估计器，能提供稳定、低方差的紧致MI下界估计，在信息瓶颈框架中具有实用价值。

Conclusion: 结果为在基于互信息的表示学习中使用判别式学习提供了新的理论依据和强有力的经验证据。

Abstract: Mutual Information (MI) is a fundamental measure of statistical dependence
widely used in representation learning. While direct optimization of MI via its
definition as a Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) is often intractable, many
recent methods have instead maximized alternative dependence measures, most
notably, the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between joint and product of
marginal distributions via discriminative losses. However, the connection
between these surrogate objectives and MI remains poorly understood. In this
work, we bridge this gap by deriving a new, tight, and tractable lower bound on
KLD as a function of JSD in the general case. By specializing this bound to
joint and marginal distributions, we demonstrate that maximizing the JSD-based
information increases a guaranteed lower bound on mutual information.
Furthermore, we revisit the practical implementation of JSD-based objectives
and observe that minimizing the cross-entropy loss of a binary classifier
trained to distinguish joint from marginal pairs recovers a known variational
lower bound on the JSD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our lower bound
is tight when applied to MI estimation. We compared our lower bound to
state-of-the-art neural estimators of variational lower bound across a range of
established reference scenarios. Our lower bound estimator consistently
provides a stable, low-variance estimate of a tight lower bound on MI. We also
demonstrate its practical usefulness in the context of the Information
Bottleneck framework. Taken together, our results provide new theoretical
justifications and strong empirical evidence for using discriminative learning
in MI-based representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界时间序列中的极端事件（如洪水、热浪、医疗紧急情况）具有重要实际意义，但现有模型由于数据不平衡和忽略中间事件信息，难以准确预测这些事件。

Method: 提出xTime框架，利用知识蒸馏从训练在较低稀有度事件上的模型转移信息，并引入专家混合机制动态选择和融合不同稀有度级别的专家模型输出。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，xTime在极端事件上的预测准确率从3%提升到78%，实现了显著的性能改进。

Conclusion: xTime通过知识蒸馏和专家混合机制有效解决了极端事件预测中的数据不平衡问题，显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Extreme events frequently occur in real-world time series and often carry
significant practical implications. In domains such as climate and healthcare,
these events, such as floods, heatwaves, or acute medical episodes, can lead to
serious consequences. Accurate forecasting of such events is therefore of
substantial importance. Most existing time series forecasting models are
optimized for overall performance within the prediction window, but often
struggle to accurately predict extreme events, such as high temperatures or
heart rate spikes. The main challenges are data imbalance and the neglect of
valuable information contained in intermediate events that precede extreme
events. In this paper, we propose xTime, a novel framework for extreme event
forecasting in time series. xTime leverages knowledge distillation to transfer
information from models trained on lower-rarity events, thereby improving
prediction performance on rarer ones. In addition, we introduce a mixture of
experts (MoE) mechanism that dynamically selects and fuses outputs from expert
models across different rarity levels, which further improves the forecasting
performance for extreme events. Experiments on multiple datasets show that
xTime achieves consistent improvements, with forecasting accuracy on extreme
events improving from 3% to 78%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNSS信号在城市环境中容易受到干扰，传统数据驱动方法在定位方面表现尚可但信号强度场重建效果差，主要受限于空间上下文信息不足。

Method: 使用混合贝叶斯专家混合框架，结合物理路径损耗模型（保证物理一致性）和CNN（利用建筑高度图捕捉城市传播效应），通过对数线性池化进行融合，采用拉普拉斯近似进行贝叶斯推断。

Result: 在城市射线追踪数据上的实验表明，随着训练点增加，定位精度提高且不确定性降低，不确定性主要集中在干扰源附近和传播最敏感的城市峡谷区域。

Conclusion: 该混合框架能够有效改善GNSS干扰源定位精度和信号强度场重建质量，同时提供后验不确定性估计，在城市环境中表现良好。

Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are vulnerable to jamming,
particularly in urban areas where multipath and shadowing distort received
power. Previous data-driven approaches achieved reasonable localization but
poorly reconstructed the received signal strength (RSS) field due to limited
spatial context. We propose a hybrid Bayesian mixture-of-experts framework that
fuses a physical path-loss (PL) model and a convolutional neural network (CNN)
through log-linear pooling. The PL expert ensures physical consistency, while
the CNN leverages building-height maps to capture urban propagation effects.
Bayesian inference with Laplace approximation provides posterior uncertainty
over both the jammer position and RSS field. Experiments on urban ray-tracing
data show that localization accuracy improves and uncertainty decreases with
more training points, while uncertainty concentrates near the jammer and along
urban canyons where propagation is most sensitive.

Conclusion: 证明了早期视觉系统可靠解码的可行性，为神经科学和神经工程应用提供实用见解。

Abstract: Decoding visual stimuli from neural population activity is crucial for
understanding the brain and for applications in brain-machine interfaces.
However, such biological data is often scarce, particularly in primates or
humans, where high-throughput recording techniques, such as two-photon imaging,
remain challenging or impossible to apply. This, in turn, poses a challenge for
deep learning decoding techniques. To overcome this, we introduce MEIcoder, a
biologically informed decoding method that leverages neuron-specific most
exciting inputs (MEIs), a structural similarity index measure loss, and
adversarial training. MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in
reconstructing visual stimuli from single-cell activity in primary visual
cortex (V1), especially excelling on small datasets with fewer recorded
neurons. Using ablation studies, we demonstrate that MEIs are the main drivers
of the performance, and in scaling experiments, we show that MEIcoder can
reconstruct high-fidelity natural-looking images from as few as 1,000-2,500
neurons and less than 1,000 training data points. We also propose a unified
benchmark with over 160,000 samples to foster future research. Our results
demonstrate the feasibility of reliable decoding in early visual system and
provide practical insights for neuroscience and neuroengineering applications.

Abstract: This is not a typical survey of world models; it is a guide for those who
want to build worlds. We do not aim to catalog every paper that has ever
mentioned a ``world model". Instead, we follow one clear road: from early
masked models that unified representation learning across modalities, to
unified architectures that share a single paradigm, then to interactive
generative models that close the action-perception loop, and finally to
memory-augmented systems that sustain consistent worlds over time. We bypass
loosely related branches to focus on the core: the generative heart, the
interactive loop, and the memory system. We show that this is the most
promising path towards true world models.

Abstract: Determining the appropriate locus of care for addiction patients is one of
the most critical clinical decisions that affects patient treatment outcomes
and effective use of resources. With a lack of sufficient specialized treatment
resources, such as inpatient beds or staff, there is an unmet need to develop
an automated framework for the same. Current decision-making approaches suffer
from severe class imbalances in addiction datasets. To address this limitation,
we propose a novel graph neural network (GRACE) framework that formalizes locus
of care prediction as a structured learning problem. Further, we perform
extensive feature engineering and propose a new approach of obtaining an
unbiased meta-graph to train a GNN to overcome the class imbalance problem.
Experimental results in real-world data show an improvement of 11-35% in terms
of the F1 score of the minority class over competitive baselines. The codes and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前脑机接口中神经解码器面临的两难问题：简单的因果模型缺乏泛化能力，复杂的非因果模型虽然泛化好但难以实时应用，且都依赖高能耗的人工神经网络，不适合资源受限的现实系统。

Method: 提出Spikachu框架，直接将分箱的脉冲投影到共享潜在空间，通过适应输入时序的脉冲模块提取相关特征，然后整合这些潜在表示并解码生成行为预测。

Result: 在6只非人类灵长类动物的113个记录会话（总计43小时）上评估，性能优于因果基线方法，能耗显著降低，且多会话训练能提升性能并实现对新会话、新个体和新任务的少样本迁移。

Conclusion: Spikachu提供了一个基于SNN的可扩展、在线兼容的神经解码框架，在保持与最先进模型竞争性能的同时，能耗降低了几个数量级。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) promise to enable vital functions, such as
speech and prosthetic control, for individuals with neuromotor impairments.
Central to their success are neural decoders, models that map neural activity
to intended behavior. Current learning-based decoding approaches fall into two
classes: simple, causal models that lack generalization, or complex, non-causal
models that generalize and scale offline but struggle in real-time settings.
Both face a common challenge, their reliance on power-hungry artificial neural
network backbones, which makes integration into real-world, resource-limited
systems difficult. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising
alternative. Because they operate causally these models are suitable for
real-time use, and their low energy demands make them ideal for
battery-constrained environments. To this end, we introduce Spikachu: a
scalable, causal, and energy-efficient neural decoding framework based on SNNs.
Our approach processes binned spikes directly by projecting them into a shared
latent space, where spiking modules, adapted to the timing of the input,
extract relevant features; these latent representations are then integrated and
decoded to generate behavioral predictions. We evaluate our approach on 113
recording sessions from 6 non-human primates, totaling 43 hours of recordings.
Our method outperforms causal baselines when trained on single sessions using
between 2.26 and 418.81 times less energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
scaling up training to multiple sessions and subjects improves performance and
enables few-shot transfer to unseen sessions, subjects, and tasks. Overall,
Spikachu introduces a scalable, online-compatible neural decoding framework
based on SNNs, whose performance is competitive relative to state-of-the-art
models while consuming orders of magnitude less energy.

Abstract: The ability to continually learn, retain and deploy skills to accomplish
goals is a key feature of intelligent and efficient behavior. However, the
neural mechanisms facilitating the continual learning and flexible
(re-)composition of skills remain elusive. Here, we study continual learning
and the compositional reuse of learned computations in recurrent neural network
(RNN) models using a novel two-system approach: one system that infers what
computation to perform, and one that implements how to perform it. We focus on
a set of compositional cognitive tasks commonly studied in neuroscience. To
construct the what system, we first show that a large family of tasks can be
systematically described by a probabilistic generative model, where
compositionality stems from a shared underlying vocabulary of discrete task
epochs. The shared epoch structure makes these tasks inherently compositional.
We first show that this compositionality can be systematically described by a
probabilistic generative model. Furthermore, We develop an unsupervised online
learning approach that can learn this model on a single-trial basis, building
its vocabulary incrementally as it is exposed to new tasks, and inferring the
latent epoch structure as a time-varying computational context within a trial.
We implement the how system as an RNN whose low-rank components are composed
according to the context inferred by the what system. Contextual inference
facilitates the creation, learning, and reuse of low-rank RNN components as new
tasks are introduced sequentially, enabling continual learning without
catastrophic forgetting. Using an example task set, we demonstrate the efficacy
and competitive performance of this two-system learning framework, its
potential for forward and backward transfer, as well as fast compositional
generalization to unseen tasks.

Method: 回顾性分析54,209例住院患者数据，使用约束评分优化(CSO)模型结合JHFRAT评估数据和电子健康记录变量，并与当前JHFRAT和XGBoost基准模型进行比较。

Result: CSO模型预测性能显著优于当前JHFRAT(AUC-ROC=0.91 vs 0.86)，在风险标签变化时表现出更好的鲁棒性，且加入EHR变量后性能相似。

Abstract: In this study we aim to better align fall risk prediction from the Johns
Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) with additional clinically
meaningful measures via a data-driven modelling approach. We conducted a
retrospective analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions from three Johns Hopkins
Health System hospitals between March 2022 and October 2023. A total of 20,208
admissions were included as high fall risk encounters, and 13,941 were included
as low fall risk encounters. To incorporate clinical knowledge and maintain
interpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models on
JHFRAT assessment data and additional electronic health record (EHR) variables.
The model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over
the current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). The constrained
score optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR
variables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the
performance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression
(AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk
labelling. This evidence-based approach provides a robust foundation for health
systems to systematically enhance inpatient fall prevention protocols and
patient safety using data-driven optimization techniques, contributing to
improved risk assessment and resource allocation in healthcare settings.

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex and precision-driven
process, characterized by thousands of interdependent parameters collected
across diverse tools and process steps. Multi-variate time-series analysis has
emerged as a critical field for real-time monitoring and fault detection in
such environments. However, anomaly prediction in semiconductor fabrication
presents several critical challenges, including high dimensionality of sensor
data and severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults. Furthermore,
the complex interdependencies between variables complicate both anomaly
prediction and root-cause-analysis. This paper proposes two novel approaches to
advance the field from anomaly detection to anomaly prediction, an essential
step toward enabling real-time process correction and proactive fault
prevention. The proposed anomaly prediction framework contains two main stages:
(a) training a forecasting model on a dataset assumed to contain no anomalies,
and (b) performing forecast on unseen time series data. The forecast is
compared with the forecast of the trained signal. Deviations beyond a
predefined threshold are flagged as anomalies. The two approaches differ in the
forecasting model employed. The first assumes independence between variables by
utilizing the N-BEATS model for univariate time series forecasting. The second
lifts this assumption by utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture
inter-variable relationships. Both models demonstrate strong forecasting
performance up to a horizon of 20 time points and maintain stable anomaly
prediction up to 50 time points. The GNN consistently outperforms the N-BEATS
model while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters and lower
computational cost. These results position the GNN as promising solution for
online anomaly forecasting to be deployed in manufacturing environments.

Motivation: Thompson采样在序列决策中应用广泛，但在强化学习等具有复杂时间结构的场景中理论基础有限，本文旨在填补这一理论空白。

Method: 使用具有联合高斯过程先验的Thompson采样方法，分析其在episodic强化学习中的性能，扩展椭圆势引理到多输出设置。

Result: 证明了在$K$个episode、每个episode长度为$H$的情况下，遗憾界为$\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{KH\Gamma(KH)})$，其中$\Gamma(\cdot)$捕捉高斯过程模型的复杂度。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了对Thompson采样在强化学习中理论理解，展示了结构假设和模型不确定性如何影响其在有限时域马尔可夫决策过程中的性能。

Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is a powerful and widely used strategy for sequential
decision-making, with applications ranging from Bayesian optimization to
reinforcement learning (RL). Despite its success, the theoretical foundations
of TS remain limited, particularly in settings with complex temporal structure
such as RL. We address this gap by establishing no-regret guarantees for TS
using models with Gaussian marginal distributions. Specifically, we consider TS
in episodic RL with joint Gaussian process (GP) priors over rewards and
transitions. We prove a regret bound of
$\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{KH\Gamma(KH)})$ over $K$ episodes of horizon $H$,
where $\Gamma(\cdot)$ captures the complexity of the GP model. Our analysis
addresses several challenges, including the non-Gaussian nature of value
functions and the recursive structure of Bellman updates, and extends classical
tools such as the elliptical potential lemma to multi-output settings. This
work advances the understanding of TS in RL and highlights how structural
assumptions and model uncertainty shape its performance in finite-horizon
Markov Decision Processes.

Motivation: 自然语言存在模糊、间接等限制，阻碍了集体智能的发展。虽然机器不受这些限制，但现有LLM多智能体系统仍主要依赖自然语言交流

Method: 将思想通信形式化为潜在变量模型，证明在非参数设置下可识别共享和私有思想，开发框架从所有智能体中提取潜在思想并分配相关思想及其共享模式

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试中验证了理论，展示了思想通信的协作优势

Conclusion: 思想通信范式可超越LLM扩展到所有模态，利用隐藏世界解决仅靠表层观察无法解决的挑战

Abstract: Natural language has long enabled human cooperation, but its lossy,
ambiguous, and indirect nature limits the potential of collective intelligence.
While machines are not subject to these constraints, most LLM-based multi-agent
systems still rely solely on natural language, exchanging tokens or their
embeddings. To go beyond language, we introduce a new paradigm, thought
communication, which enables agents to interact directly mind-to-mind, akin to
telepathy. To uncover these latent thoughts in a principled way, we formalize
the process as a general latent variable model, where agent states are
generated by an unknown function of underlying thoughts. We prove that, in a
nonparametric setting without auxiliary information, both shared and private
latent thoughts between any pair of agents can be identified. Moreover, the
global structure of thought sharing, including which agents share which
thoughts and how these relationships are structured, can also be recovered with
theoretical guarantees. Guided by the established theory, we develop a
framework that extracts latent thoughts from all agents prior to communication
and assigns each agent the relevant thoughts, along with their sharing
patterns. This paradigm naturally extends beyond LLMs to all modalities, as
most observational data arise from hidden generative processes. Experiments on
both synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate the theory and demonstrate
the collaborative advantages of thought communication. We hope this work
illuminates the potential of leveraging the hidden world, as many challenges
remain unsolvable through surface-level observation alone, regardless of
compute or data scale.

Conclusion: 提出的DP驱动多模态学习框架能够自动实现突出的模态内表示学习和跨模态对齐之间的最优平衡，在多模态融合任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Developing effective multimodal fusion approaches has become increasingly
essential in many real-world scenarios, such as health care and finance. The
key challenge is how to preserve the feature expressiveness in each modality
while learning cross-modal interactions. Previous approaches primarily focus on
the cross-modal alignment, while over-emphasis on the alignment of marginal
distributions of modalities may impose excess regularization and obstruct
meaningful representations within each modality. The Dirichlet process (DP)
mixture model is a powerful Bayesian non-parametric method that can amplify the
most prominent features by its richer-gets-richer property, which allocates
increasing weights to them. Inspired by this unique characteristic of DP, we
propose a new DP-driven multimodal learning framework that automatically
achieves an optimal balance between prominent intra-modal representation
learning and cross-modal alignment. Specifically, we assume that each modality
follows a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions and further adopt DP
to calculate the mixture weights for all the components. This paradigm allows
DP to dynamically allocate the contributions of features and select the most
prominent ones, leveraging its richer-gets-richer property, thus facilitating
multimodal feature fusion. Extensive experiments on several multimodal datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of our model over other competitors.
Ablation analysis further validates the effectiveness of DP in aligning
modality distributions and its robustness to changes in key hyperparameters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了Transformer模型在象棋游戏中的系统性泛化能力，发现模型能够进行组合泛化，在分布外场景中保持规则一致性，但在复杂变体如Chess960中表现不如符号AI算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究现代决策Transformer是否真正理解象棋规则，而非仅仅学习训练数据中的模式，通过测试其系统性泛化能力来评估模型对游戏规则的掌握程度。

Method: 训练了一个2.7亿参数的象棋Transformer模型，并在分布外场景中进行测试，包括规则外推和Chess960等变体游戏，分析模型的泛化能力和训练动态。

Result: 模型表现出组合泛化能力，在分布外情况下仍能选择有效走法；在Chess960中虽能进行基本策略适应，但不如符号AI算法；训练动态显示模型先学会移动己方棋子。

Conclusion: Transformer模型能够学习象棋的基本规则并表现出一定的组合泛化能力，但在需要深度推理的复杂变体中仍不如基于显式搜索的传统AI方法。

Abstract: Chess is a canonical example of a task that requires rigorous reasoning and
long-term planning. Modern decision Transformers - trained similarly to LLMs -
are able to learn competent gameplay, but it is unclear to what extent they
truly capture the rules of chess. To investigate this, we train a 270M
parameter chess Transformer and test it on out-of-distribution scenarios,
designed to reveal failures of systematic generalization. Our analysis shows
that Transformers exhibit compositional generalization, as evidenced by strong
rule extrapolation: they adhere to fundamental syntactic rules of the game by
consistently choosing valid moves even in situations very different from the
training data. Moreover, they also generate high-quality moves for OOD puzzles.
In a more challenging test, we evaluate the models on variants including
Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess) - a variant of chess where starting positions
of pieces are randomized. We found that while the model exhibits basic strategy
adaptation, they are inferior to symbolic AI algorithms that perform explicit
search, but gap is smaller when playing against users on Lichess. Moreover, the
training dynamics revealed that the model initially learns to move only its own
pieces, suggesting an emergent compositional understanding of the game.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文挑战了关于反向/正向KL散度在强化学习中作用的传统直觉，揭示了模式覆盖主要取决于正则化强度等因素，而非KL散度类型本身。作者提出了一个简单有效的算法来提升模型解决方案的质量和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为反向KL散度导致"模式寻找"，正向KL散度导致"质量覆盖"，但这种直觉在强化学习正则化中可能不适用。作者旨在澄清这一误解并开发更有效的算法。

Method: 通过数学分析和实证研究，作者构建了一个简单、可扩展且理论合理的算法，该算法对奖励幅度进行最小修改，优化目标分布以覆盖所有高质量采样模式。

Result: 实验表明，该算法在大型语言模型和化学语言模型的后训练中都能提高解决方案的质量和多样性，无需外部多样性信号，且对正向和反向KL散度都有效。

Conclusion: 模式覆盖主要取决于正则化强度等因素，而非KL散度类型。作者提出的简单修改能有效提升模型性能，为强化学习正则化提供了新的理论洞见和实践方法。

Abstract: It is commonly believed that optimizing the reverse KL divergence results in
"mode seeking", while optimizing forward KL results in "mass covering", with
the latter being preferred if the goal is to sample from multiple diverse
modes. We show -- mathematically and empirically -- that this intuition does
not necessarily transfer well to doing reinforcement learning with
reverse/forward KL regularization (e.g. as commonly used with language models).
Instead, the choice of reverse/forward KL determines the family of optimal
target distributions, parameterized by the regularization coefficient. Mode
coverage depends primarily on other factors, such as regularization strength,
and relative scales between rewards and reference probabilities. Further, we
show commonly used settings such as low regularization strength and equal
verifiable rewards tend to specify unimodal target distributions, meaning the
optimization objective is, by construction, non-diverse. We leverage these
insights to construct a simple, scalable, and theoretically justified
algorithm. It makes minimal changes to reward magnitudes, yet optimizes for a
target distribution which puts high probability over all high-quality sampling
modes. In experiments, this simple modification works to post-train both Large
Language Models and Chemical Language Models to have higher solution quality
and diversity, without any external signals of diversity, and works with both
forward and reverse KL when using either naively fails.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种量子启发的算法，使用矩阵乘积态(MPS)和密度矩阵重整化群(DMRG)方法解决QUBO问题，在数独和MaxCut问题上成功找到全局最优解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决二次无约束二进制优化(QUBO)问题，这类问题在数学上等价于寻找伊辛自旋玻璃哈密顿量的基态，具有重要的理论和实际应用价值。

Method: 使用矩阵乘积态(MPS)紧凑表示自旋构型的大叠加态，采用离散驱动调度引导MPS向基态演化，结合驱动哈密顿量和问题哈密顿量实现自旋翻转和量子隧穿，通过DMRG方法迭代最小化系统能量。

Result: 算法在包含200多个伊辛自旋的数独问题和Biq Mac库中最多251个节点、3265条边的MaxCut问题上，都能可靠地找到全局最小值而非近似解。

Conclusion: 这种量子启发方法具有可扩展性、通用性和适用于工业级QUBO应用的优势。

Abstract: We propose and evaluate a quantum-inspired algorithm for solving Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, which are mathematically
equivalent to finding ground states of Ising spin-glass Hamiltonians. The
algorithm employs Matrix Product States (MPS) to compactly represent large
superpositions of spin configurations and utilizes a discrete driving schedule
to guide the MPS toward the ground state. At each step, a driver Hamiltonian --
incorporating a transverse magnetic field -- is combined with the problem
Hamiltonian to enable spin flips and facilitate quantum tunneling. The MPS is
updated using the standard Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method,
which iteratively minimizes the system's energy via multiple sweeps across the
spin chain. Despite its heuristic nature, the algorithm reliably identifies
global minima, not merely near-optimal solutions, across diverse QUBO
instances. We first demonstrate its effectiveness on intermediate-level Sudoku
puzzles from publicly available sources, involving over $200$ Ising spins with
long-range couplings dictated by constraint satisfaction. We then apply the
algorithm to MaxCut problems from the Biq Mac library, successfully solving
instances with up to $251$ nodes and $3,265$ edges. We discuss the advantages
of this quantum-inspired approach, including its scalability, generalizability,
and suitability for industrial-scale QUBO applications.

Motivation: 当前AI在能源领域的应用缺乏标准化框架来评估系统推理的正确性，现有验证方法主要关注预测准确性或计算效率，而忽略了分析结论的逻辑完整性。

Method: 开发了分析可靠性基准(ARB)，整合准确性、推理可靠性、不确定性约束、政策一致性和透明度五个子指标，使用公开技术经济数据集在确定性、概率性和认知性场景下评估模型性能。

Result: GPT-4/5和Claude 4.5 Sonnet实现了稳定且符合政策的推理(分析可靠性指数大于90)，Gemini 2.5 Pro表现中等，Llama 3 70B低于专业阈值，统计验证表明这些差异显著且可重现。

Conclusion: ARB建立了能源文献中首个验证AI系统中因果、概率和政策驱动推理的定量方法，为全球能源转型中可信和透明的分析应用提供了参考框架。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasingly used for
forecasting, optimization, and policy design in the energy sector, yet no
standardized framework exists to evaluate whether these systems reason
correctly. Current validation practices focus on predictive accuracy or
computational efficiency, leaving the logical integrity of analytical
conclusions untested. This study introduces the Analytical Reliability
Benchmark (ARB), a reproducible framework that quantifies reasoning reliability
in large language models applied to energy system analysis. The benchmark
integrates five submetrics: accuracy, reasoning reliability, uncertainty
discipline, policy consistency, and transparency, and evaluates model
performance across deterministic, probabilistic, and epistemic scenarios using
open technoeconomic datasets (NREL ATB 2024, DOE H2A/H2New, IEA WEO 2024). Four
frontier models (GPT-4/5, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B) were
tested under identical factual and regulatory conditions. Results show that
reasoning reliability can be objectively measured. GPT-4/5 and Claude 4.5
Sonnet achieved consistent and policy-compliant reasoning (Analytical
Reliability Index greater than 90), Gemini 2.5 Pro demonstrated moderate
stability, and Llama 3 70B remained below professional thresholds. Statistical
validation confirmed that these differences are significant and reproducible.
The ARB establishes the first quantitative method in the energy literature for
verifying causal, probabilistic, and policy-driven reasoning in artificial
intelligence systems, providing a reference framework for trustworthy and
transparent analytical applications in the global energy transition.

Conclusion: Branch-and-Browse是一个可靠且高效的基于LLM的网页代理框架。

Abstract: Autonomous web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) show strong
potential for performing goal-oriented tasks such as information retrieval,
report generation, and online transactions. These agents mark a key step toward
practical embodied reasoning in open web environments. However, existing
approaches remain limited in reasoning depth and efficiency: vanilla linear
methods fail at multi-step reasoning and lack effective backtracking, while
other search strategies are coarse-grained and computationally costly. We
introduce Branch-and-Browse, a fine-grained web agent framework that unifies
structured reasoning-acting, contextual memory, and efficient execution. It (i)
employs explicit subtask management with tree-structured exploration for
controllable multi-branch reasoning, (ii) bootstraps exploration through
efficient web state replay with background reasoning, and (iii) leverages a
page action memory to share explored actions within and across sessions. On the
WebArena benchmark, Branch-and-Browse achieves a task success rate of 35.8\%
and reduces execution time by up to 40.4\% relative to state-of-the-art
methods. These results demonstrate that Branch-and-Browse is a reliable and
efficient framework for LLM-based web agents.

Conclusion: 该框架在自由形式思维链和形式证明系统之间提供了平衡，为LLMs推理评估提供了可操作的诊断工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on mathematical
problems when prompted with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), yet it remains unclear
whether this success stems from search, rote procedures, or rule-consistent
reasoning. To address this, we propose modeling CoT as a certain rule-based
stochastic process over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where nodes represent
intermediate derivation states and edges encode rule applications. Within this
framework, we introduce logical closeness, a metric that quantifies how well a
model's CoT trajectory (i.e., the LLM's final output) adheres to the DAG
structure, providing evaluation beyond classical PASS@k metrics. Building on
this, we introduce the DAG-MATH CoT format and construct a benchmark that
guides LLMs to generate CoT trajectories in this format, thereby enabling the
evaluation of their reasoning ability under our framework. Across standard
mathematical reasoning datasets, our analysis uncovers statistically
significant differences in reasoning fidelity among representative LLM
families-even when PASS@k is comparable-highlighting gaps between final-answer
accuracy and rule-consistent derivation. Our framework provides a balance
between free-form CoT and formal proofs systems, offering actionable
diagnostics for LLMs reasoning evaluation. Our benchmark and code are available

Abstract: Relational multi-table data is common in domains such as e-commerce,
healthcare, and scientific research, and can be naturally represented as
heterogeneous temporal graphs with multi-modal node attributes. Existing graph
neural networks (GNNs) rely on schema-specific feature encoders, requiring
separate modules for each node type and feature column, which hinders
scalability and parameter sharing. We introduce RELATE (Relational Encoder for
Latent Aggregation of Typed Entities), a schema-agnostic, plug-and-play feature
encoder that can be used with any general purpose GNN. RELATE employs shared
modality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal
attributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that
aggregates features into a fixed-size, permutation-invariant node
representation. We evaluate RELATE on ReLGNN and HGT in the RelBench benchmark,
where it achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while
reducing parameter counts by up to 5x. This design supports varying schemas and
enables multi-dataset pretraining for general-purpose GNNs, paving the way
toward foundation models for relational graph data.

### [258] [A new wave of vehicle insurance fraud fueled by generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19957)
*Amir Hever,Itai Orr*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 生成式AI正在加剧保险欺诈，使得大规模快速伪造事故证据变得容易。保险公司开始部署AI反制措施，但面临检测工具误报漏报、欺诈者不断适应等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保险欺诈每年造成数百亿美元损失，传统欺诈手段包括伪造事故、夸大损失等。生成式AI的出现让欺诈者能轻松制造逼真的碰撞照片、损坏证据和假身份文件，加剧了保险欺诈问题。

Method: 保险公司部署基于AI的深度伪造检测软件和增强验证流程来检测和减轻AI驱动的欺诈。UVeye提出了分层解决方案来检测、减轻和威慑这种新型欺诈。

Result: 当前的反欺诈策略面临显著限制：检测工具存在误报和漏报问题，复杂的欺诈者不断调整策略规避自动检查，形成猫鼠游戏。

Conclusion: 打击AI驱动的保险欺诈仍是一个持续挑战，需要更先进的分层解决方案来应对这种新型欺诈浪潮。

Abstract: Generative AI is supercharging insurance fraud by making it easier to falsify
accident evidence at scale and in rapid time. Insurance fraud is a pervasive
and costly problem, amounting to tens of billions of dollars in losses each
year. In the vehicle insurance sector, fraud schemes have traditionally
involved staged accidents, exaggerated damage, or forged documents. The rise of
generative AI, including deepfake image and video generation, has introduced
new methods for committing fraud at scale. Fraudsters can now fabricate highly
realistic crash photos, damage evidence, and even fake identities or documents
with minimal effort, exploiting AI tools to bolster false insurance claims.
Insurers have begun deploying countermeasures such as AI-based deepfake
detection software and enhanced verification processes to detect and mitigate
these AI-driven scams. However, current mitigation strategies face significant
limitations. Detection tools can suffer from false positives and negatives, and
sophisticated fraudsters continuously adapt their tactics to evade automated
checks. This cat-and-mouse arms race between generative AI and detection
technology, combined with resource and cost barriers for insurers, means that
combating AI-enabled insurance fraud remains an ongoing challenge. In this
white paper, we present UVeye layered solution for vehicle fraud, representing
a major leap forward in the ability to detect, mitigate and deter this new wave
of fraud.

TL;DR: 该研究使用机器学习模型通过领导力人格特质预测学术成功，在129名环境工程硕士生中实现了最高87.50%的预测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI技术在个性化学习中的潜力，通过领导力人格特质预测学术表现，为早期识别学生优缺点和制定个性化学习策略提供机会。

Method: 收集129名硕士生的5项领导力人格测试数据（23个特征），结合平均成绩，使用Pearson相关系数进行特征选择，调优7种机器学习算法（SVM、LR、KNN、DT、GB、RF、XGBoost、LightGBM）。

Result: 随机森林分类器表现最佳，包含17个人格特征和领导力标记的模型准确率达87.50%，不包含该特征的模型准确率达85.71%。

Conclusion: 研究证明领导力人格特质可有效预测学术成功，为早期识别学生优缺点和制定个性化学习策略提供了新方法。

Abstract: The study explores the potential of AI technologies in personalized learning,
suggesting the prediction of academic success through leadership personality
traits and machine learning modelling. The primary data were obtained from 129
master's students in the Environmental Engineering Department, who underwent
five leadership personality tests with 23 characteristics. Students used
self-assessment tools that included Personality Insight, Workplace Culture,
Motivation at Work, Management Skills, and Emotion Control tests. The test
results were combined with the average grade obtained from academic reports.
The study employed exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis. Feature
selection utilized Pearson correlation coefficients of personality traits. The
average grades were separated into three categories: fail, pass, and excellent.
The modelling process was performed by tuning seven ML algorithms, such as SVM,
LR, KNN, DT, GB, RF, XGBoost and LightGBM. The highest predictive performance
was achieved with the RF classifier, which yielded an accuracy of 87.50% for
the model incorporating 17 personality trait features and the leadership mark
feature, and an accuracy of 85.71% for the model excluding this feature. In
this way, the study offers an additional opportunity to identify students'
strengths and weaknesses at an early stage of their education process and
select the most suitable strategies for personalized learning.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet
still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet
containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that
celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could
conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible
thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and
efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter
open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message
as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in
seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of
text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication,
already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete
scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its
answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises
urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it
means for a Large Language Model to know something.

Method: 采用组件化编排层进行确定性路由决策，结合OpenSearch和金融领域嵌入模型的混合检索管道，以及融合规则启发式、序列行为建模和上下文多臂老虎机的多阶段推荐机制。

Result: 系统在24个NVIDIA H100 GPU上通过Docker Swarm和vLLM全本地化部署，通过人工QA和系统指标验证了基于事实的生成、显式路由和分层安全机制能够在高风险金融环境中提供可信的AI洞察。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过显式路由和分层安全机制的基于事实的生成方法，能够在高风险的金融环境中提供可信的AI洞察，为生产级金融AI系统提供了可行的技术路径。

Abstract: We present AI PB, a production-scale generative agent deployed in real retail
finance. Unlike reactive chatbots that answer queries passively, AI PB
proactively generates grounded, compliant, and user-specific investment
insights. It integrates (i) a component-based orchestration layer that
deterministically routes between internal and external LLMs based on data
sensitivity, (ii) a hybrid retrieval pipeline using OpenSearch and the
finance-domain embedding model, and (iii) a multi-stage recommendation
mechanism combining rule heuristics, sequential behavioral modeling, and
contextual bandits. Operating fully on-premises under Korean financial
regulations, the system employs Docker Swarm and vLLM across 24 X NVIDIA H100
GPUs. Through human QA and system metrics, we demonstrate that grounded
generation with explicit routing and layered safety can deliver trustworthy AI
insights in high-stakes finance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高金融取证中异常检测的透明度和可信度，让非专家用户能够通过自然语言查询和理解检测结果。

Method: 构建包含解析、检测和解释三个角色的多智能体系统，将用户意图转换为XGBoost检测器的查询模式，生成基于特征的叙述性解释。

Result: 在比特币混币数据集上，基线检测器达到高准确率，HCLA系统增加了可解释性和交互式优化能力。

Conclusion: 人机协同设计能够显著提升金融取证系统的透明度和用户信任度。

Abstract: We present HCLA, a human-centered multi-agent system for anomaly detection in
digital asset transactions. The system links three roles: Parsing, Detection,
and Explanation, into a conversational workflow that lets non-experts ask
questions in natural language, inspect structured analytics, and obtain
context-aware rationales. Implemented with an open-source web UI, HCLA
translates user intents into a schema for a classical detector (XGBoost in our
prototype) and returns narrative explanations grounded in the underlying
features. On a labeled Bitcoin mixing dataset (Wasabi Wallet, 2020-2024), the
baseline detector reaches strong accuracy, while HCLA adds interpretability and
interactive refinement. We describe the architecture, interaction loop,
dataset, evaluation protocol, and limitations, and discuss how a
human-in-the-loop design improves transparency and trust in financial
forensics.

*Joshua Yuvaraj*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文认为需要重新评估AI在法律实践中的使用，提出了验证-价值悖论模型，指出AI带来的效率提升会被相应的验证需求抵消，导致净价值往往微乎其微。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于律师因提交不准确的AI生成内容而受到谴责的案例，以及AI与现实脱节、缺乏透明性的特点与律师诚实、正直、不误导法庭等首要职责之间的冲突，需要重新评估AI在法律实践中的使用范式。

Method: 提出了一种替代性的AI使用模型——验证-价值悖论，该模型更全面地反映了AI的特性和律师的职责要求。

Result: 验证-价值悖论表明，AI在法律实践中带来的效率提升会被相应增加的输出验证需求所抵消，导致AI使用的净价值对律师而言往往微乎其微。

Conclusion: 论文阐述了该悖论对法律实践和法律教育的影响，强调法律实践应建立在忠于真理和公民责任等价值观基础上。

Abstract: It is often claimed that machine learning-based generative AI products will
drastically streamline and reduce the cost of legal practice. This enthusiasm
assumes lawyers can effectively manage AI's risks. Cases in Australia and
elsewhere in which lawyers have been reprimanded for submitting inaccurate
AI-generated content to courts suggest this paradigm must be revisited. This
paper argues that a new paradigm is needed to evaluate AI use in practice,
given (a) AI's disconnection from reality and its lack of transparency, and (b)
lawyers' paramount duties like honesty, integrity, and not to mislead the
court. It presents an alternative model of AI use in practice that more
holistically reflects these features (the verification-value paradox). That
paradox suggests increases in efficiency from AI use in legal practice will be
met by a correspondingly greater imperative to manually verify any outputs of
that use, rendering the net value of AI use often negligible to lawyers. The
paper then sets out the paradox's implications for legal practice and legal
education, including for AI use but also the values that the paradox suggests
should undergird legal practice: fidelity to the truth and civic
responsibility.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了TRUST框架，一个去中心化的大语言模型推理审计系统，通过共识机制、层次化DAG分解、区块链账本和隐私保护分段来解决集中式审计的鲁棒性、可扩展性、透明度和隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型审计方法存在集中化、不透明和难以扩展的问题，在关键领域部署专有模型存在重大风险。需要解决鲁棒性、可扩展性、透明度和隐私四个核心挑战。

Method: TRUST框架包含：1) 多样化审计员间的共识机制，可容忍30%恶意参与者；2) 推理链的层次化DAG分解，支持可扩展并行审计；3) 区块链账本记录验证决策；4) 隐私保护分段，仅共享部分推理步骤。

Result: 在多个LLM（GPT-OSS、DeepSeek-r1、Qwen）和推理任务（数学、医学、科学、人文）上的实验表明，TRUST能有效检测推理缺陷，并对抗性审计员保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TRUST开创了去中心化AI审计的先河，为大语言模型的安全可信部署提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models generate complex reasoning chains that reveal their
decision-making, yet verifying the faithfulness and harmlessness of these
intermediate steps remains a critical unsolved problem. Existing auditing
methods are centralized, opaque, and hard to scale, creating significant risks
for deploying proprietary models in high-stakes domains. We identify four core
challenges: (1) Robustness: Centralized auditors are single points of failure,
prone to bias or attacks. (2) Scalability: Reasoning traces are too long for
manual verification. (3) Opacity: Closed auditing undermines public trust. (4)
Privacy: Exposing full reasoning risks model theft or distillation. We propose
TRUST, a transparent, decentralized auditing framework that overcomes these
limitations via: (1) A consensus mechanism among diverse auditors, guaranteeing
correctness under up to $30\%$ malicious participants. (2) A hierarchical DAG
decomposition of reasoning traces, enabling scalable, parallel auditing. (3) A
blockchain ledger that records all verification decisions for public
accountability. (4) Privacy-preserving segmentation, sharing only partial
reasoning steps to protect proprietary logic. We provide theoretical guarantees
for the security and economic incentives of the TRUST framework. Experiments
across multiple LLMs (GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-r1, Qwen) and reasoning tasks (math,
medical, science, humanities) show TRUST effectively detects reasoning flaws
and remains robust against adversarial auditors. Our work pioneers
decentralized AI auditing, offering a practical path toward safe and
trustworthy LLM deployment.

*Marcelo Maciel Amaral,Raymond Aschheim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出AGI发展需要经历身份固化的锁定阶段，从开放模仿转向稳定的目标结构和行为模式，并提出了检测这一阶段的操作性指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型目前过于开放和可操纵，而真正的AGI需要经历身份固化阶段，使目标结构、拒绝行为和内部表征变得稳定，这对可靠性和安全性至关重要。

Method: 通过形式化身份固化阶段，将其与学习动力学现象联系起来，并提出操作性指标进行检测，通过实验验证行为固化的动态特征。

Result: 实验显示行为固化过程快速且非线性，但对通用能力的影响存在光谱：小模型出现性能权衡，中等规模模型几乎无成本，大型量化模型出现瞬时不稳定性。

Conclusion: 身份固化是AGI级可靠性的先决条件，也是安全性的关键控制点，可以工程化设计可靠身份，但也可能在扩展过程中自发出现，固化不可预测的目标和行为。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain broadly open and highly steerable: they
imitate at scale, accept arbitrary system prompts, and readily adopt multiple
personae. By analogy to human development, we hypothesize that progress toward
artificial general intelligence (AGI) involves a lock-in phase: a transition
from open imitation to identity consolidation, in which goal structures,
refusals, preferences, and internal representations become comparatively stable
and resistant to external steering. We formalize this phase, link it to known
phenomena in learning dynamics, and propose operational metrics for onset
detection. Experimentally, we demonstrate that while the behavioral
consolidation is rapid and non-linear, its side-effects on general capabilities
are not monolithic. Our results reveal a spectrum of outcomes--from performance
trade-offs in small models, through largely cost-free adoption in mid-scale
models, to transient instabilities in large, quantized models. We argue that
such consolidation is a prerequisite for AGI-level reliability and also a
critical control point for safety: identities can be deliberately engineered
for reliability, yet may also emerge spontaneously during scaling, potentially
hardening unpredictable goals and behaviors.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在2048游戏中优化AI的进化训练方法，比较了单智能体系统和双智能体元提示系统的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化AI在动态环境中的表现是机器学习研究的基本挑战。2048游戏结合了策略性游戏和随机元素，为研究决策制定、长期规划和动态适应提供了理想平台。

Method: 实现两种系统：双智能体元提示系统（一个"思考者"LLM为"执行者"LLM优化策略）和基于改进价值函数的单智能体系统（使用有限蒙特卡洛树搜索），并实验回滚功能以避免性能退化。

Result: 单智能体系统取得显著改进，平均每个周期增加473.2分，训练周期呈现明显上升趋势（相关性ρ=0.607）。LLM对游戏的理解也随着高级策略的发展而增长。相反，双智能体系统改进有限。

Conclusion: 进化优化技术在非确定性环境中具有改进AI性能的潜力，但元提示方法存在固有局限性。

Abstract: Optimizing artificial intelligence (AI) for dynamic environments remains a
fundamental challenge in machine learning research. In this paper, we examine
evolutionary training methods for optimizing AI to solve the game 2048, a 2D
sliding puzzle. 2048, with its mix of strategic gameplay and stochastic
elements, presents an ideal playground for studying decision-making, long-term
planning, and dynamic adaptation. We implemented two distinct systems: a
two-agent metaprompting system where a "thinker" large language model (LLM)
agent refines gameplay strategies for an "executor" LLM agent, and a
single-agent system based on refining a value function for a limited Monte
Carlo Tree Search. We also experimented with rollback features to avoid
performance degradation. Our results demonstrate the potential of evolutionary
refinement techniques in improving AI performance in non-deterministic
environments. The single-agent system achieved substantial improvements, with
an average increase of 473.2 points per cycle, and with clear upward trends
(correlation $\rho$=0.607) across training cycles. The LLM's understanding of
the game grew as well, shown in its development of increasingly advanced
strategies. Conversely, the two-agent system did not garner much improvement,
highlighting the inherent limits of meta-prompting.

TL;DR: 该论文提出个性化认知模拟(ICS)任务，评估不同认知表征方法在模拟个体思维过程方面的效果。通过构建基于新出版小说的数据集和11条件认知评估框架，测试了7个现成LLM在作者风格模仿中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型能模仿表面的人类行为，但其模拟更深层次个体认知过程的能力仍不清楚。研究旨在填补这一空白，评估不同认知表征方法在个性化认知模拟中的有效性。

Method: 构建基于新出版小说（晚于测试LLM发布日期）的数据集，提出11条件认知评估框架，测试7个现成LLM在作者风格模仿中的表现。比较不同认知表征方法：语言特征、概念映射和基于档案的信息。

Result: 结果显示，结合概念和语言特征在ICS中特别有效，在整体评估中优于基于静态档案的线索。LLM在模仿语言风格方面比模仿叙事结构更有效，突显了它们在更深层认知模拟中的局限性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为开发适应个体思维和表达方式的AI系统奠定了基础，推动了更个性化和人类对齐的创意技术的发展。

Abstract: Individualized cognitive simulation (ICS) aims to build computational models
that approximate the thought processes of specific individuals. While large
language models (LLMs) convincingly mimic surface-level human behavior such as
role-play, their ability to simulate deeper individualized cognitive processes
remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we introduce a novel task that
evaluates different cognitive representation methods in ICS. We construct a
dataset from recently published novels (later than the release date of the
tested LLMs) and propose an 11-condition cognitive evaluation framework to
benchmark seven off-the-shelf LLMs in the context of authorial style emulation.
We hypothesize that effective cognitive representations can help LLMs generate
storytelling that better mirrors the original author. Thus, we test different
cognitive representations, e.g., linguistic features, concept mappings, and
profile-based information. Results show that combining conceptual and
linguistic features is particularly effective in ICS, outperforming static
profile-based cues in overall evaluation. Importantly, LLMs are more effective
at mimicking linguistic style than narrative structure, underscoring their
limits in deeper cognitive simulation. These findings provide a foundation for
developing AI systems that adapt to individual ways of thinking and expression,
advancing more personalized and human-aligned creative technologies.

TL;DR: 使用大型语言模型通过上下文学习生成抽象PDDL领域和问题实例，以支持基于自然语言目标的规划、推理和解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为动态领域生成与特定目标一致的抽象表示是一个重要挑战，因为抽象选择会影响智能体的规划、推理和解释能力。

Method: 在PDDL中建模智能体具体行为，利用大型语言模型（如GPT-4o）通过上下文学习生成抽象PDDL领域和问题实例，涵盖动作选择、动作序列和参数抽象等类别。

Result: GPT-4o在简单设置下能有效合成有用的规划领域抽象，但在动作抽象方面优于相关谓词抽象。生成的抽象通过符号验证工具和专家评估。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在生成规划领域抽象方面具有潜力，特别是在动作抽象方面表现良好，但在谓词抽象方面仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Generating an abstraction of a dynamic domain that aligns with a given
purpose remains a significant challenge given that the choice of such an
abstraction can impact an agent's ability to plan, reason, and provide
explanations effectively. We model the agent's concrete behaviors in PDDL and
investigate the use of in-context learning with large language models (LLMs)
for the generation of abstract PDDL domains and problem instances, given an
abstraction objective specified in natural language. The benchmark examples we
use are new and have not been part of the data any LLMs have been trained on.
We consider three categories of abstractions: abstraction of choice of
alternative concrete actions, abstraction of sequences of concrete actions, and
abstraction of action/predicate parameters, as well as combinations of these.
The generated abstract PDDL domains and problem instances are then checked by
symbolic validation tools as well as human experts. Our experiments show that
GPT-4o can generally synthesize useful planning domain abstractions in simple
settings, although it is better at abstracting over actions than over the
associated fluents.

TL;DR: 提出了STaBERT模型，通过整合POI语义信息和时间描述符来增强人类移动性预测，显著提升了预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人类移动性预测模型要么只建模位置序列，要么仅将时间信息作为辅助输入，未能充分利用POI提供的丰富语义上下文。

Method: 在BERT-based移动性模型基础上，引入派生的时间描述符和POI嵌入，构建统一的语义增强移动性表示，提出STaBERT模型。

Result: 实验结果显示STaBERT显著提升预测精度：单城市预测的GEO-BLEU得分从0.34提升到0.75；多城市预测从0.34提升到0.56。

Conclusion: 整合POI语义信息和时间描述符能够有效提升人类移动性预测的准确性，STaBERT模型在单城市和多城市预测中都取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Human mobility forecasting is crucial for disaster relief, city planning, and
public health. However, existing models either only model location sequences or
include time information merely as auxiliary input, thereby failing to leverage
the rich semantic context provided by points of interest (POIs). To address
this, we enrich a BERT-based mobility model with derived temporal descriptors
and POI embeddings to better capture the semantics underlying human movement.
We propose STaBERT (Semantic-Temporal aware BERT), which integrates both POI
and temporal information at each location to construct a unified, semantically
enriched representation of mobility. Experimental results show that STaBERT
significantly improves prediction accuracy: for single-city prediction, the
GEO-BLEU score improved from 0.34 to 0.75; for multi-city prediction, from 0.34
to 0.56.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法直接使用视觉语言模型探索环境回答问题，缺乏显式思考和规划，导致推理能力有限、探索效率低下和回答效果不佳。

Method: 提出ToolEQA代理，集成外部工具进行多步推理；设计自动化的EQA数据生成流程，构建包含推理轨迹的大规模EQA-RT数据集（约18K任务）。

Result: 在EQA-RT-Seen和EQA-RT-Unseen测试集上，ToolEQA比最先进基线方法成功率提升9.2~20.2%，比零样本ToolEQA提升10%；在HM-EQA、OpenEQA和EXPRESS-Bench数据集上也达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: ToolEQA通过集成外部工具和多步推理，显著提升了具身问答的性能和效率，展示了良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) requires agents to explore 3D environments
to obtain observations and answer questions related to the scene. Existing
methods leverage VLMs to directly explore the environment and answer questions
without explicit thinking or planning, which limits their reasoning ability and
results in excessive or inefficient exploration as well as ineffective
responses. In this paper, we introduce ToolEQA, an agent that integrates
external tools with multi-step reasoning, where external tools can provide more
useful information for completing the task, helping the model derive better
exploration directions in the next step of reasoning and thus obtaining
additional effective information. This enables ToolEQA to generate more
accurate responses with a shorter exploration distance. To enhance the model's
ability for tool-usage and multi-step reasoning, we further design a novel EQA
data generation pipeline that automatically constructs large-scale EQA tasks
with reasoning trajectories and corresponding answers. Based on the pipeline,
we collect the EQA-RT dataset that contains about 18K tasks, divided into a
training set EQA-RT-Train, and two test sets EQA-RT-Seen (scenes overlapping
with the training set) and EQA-RT-Unseen (novel scenes). Experiments on
EQA-RT-Seen and EQA-RT-Unseen show that ToolEQA improves the success rate by
9.2~20.2% over state-of-the-art baselines, while outperforming the zero-shot
ToolEQA by 10% in success rate. In addition, ToolEQA also achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the HM-EQA, OpenEQA, and EXPRESS-Bench
datasets, demonstrating its generality. Our homepage see

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI在医疗领域前景广阔，但由于训练数据的质量和公平性问题，AI解决方案在真实临床实践中的整合仍然有限。主要障碍是数据收集过程中的偏见问题。

Method: 基于西班牙国家研发计划中的AI4HealthyAging项目，通过检测临床数据收集过程中的偏见，识别了多种偏见类型。

Result: 识别了历史偏见、代表性偏见和测量偏见等多种偏见类型，这些偏见体现在性别、年龄、居住地、社会经济地位、设备和标签等变量中。

Conclusion: 提出了改善临床问题设计和数据收集公平性和鲁棒性的实用建议，希望这些发现和经验能为开发更公平的医疗AI系统提供指导。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for transforming healthcare.
However, despite significant advances, the integration of AI solutions into
real-world clinical practice remains limited. A major barrier is the quality
and fairness of training data, which is often compromised by biased data
collection practices. This paper draws on insights from the AI4HealthyAging
project, part of Spain's national R&D initiative, where our task was to detect
biases during clinical data collection. We identify several types of bias
across multiple use cases, including historical, representation, and
measurement biases. These biases manifest in variables such as sex, gender,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在AI系统在战场中作用日益重要的时代，确保负责任的目标打击需要对潜在附带效应进行严格评估。

Method: 采用设计科学方法，构建统一的KRR架构，整合时间、空间和力量维度，包含分层结构捕获AI系统类别、架构组件、打击向量和上下文方面，并考虑传播、严重性、可能性和评估指标。

Result: 模型通过实例化进行了演示和评估，为构建负责任和可信赖的智能系统奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 该模型为评估军事行动中打击AI系统产生的效应提供了透明推理机制，有助于构建更负责任的智能系统。

Abstract: In an era where AI (Artificial Intelligence) systems play an increasing role
in the battlefield, ensuring responsible targeting demands rigorous assessment
of potential collateral effects. In this context, a novel collateral damage
assessment model for target engagement of AI systems in military operations is
introduced. The model integrates temporal, spatial, and force dimensions within
a unified Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) architecture following a
design science methodological approach. Its layered structure captures the
categories and architectural components of the AI systems to be engaged
together with corresponding engaging vectors and contextual aspects. At the
same time, spreading, severity, likelihood, and evaluation metrics are
considered in order to provide a clear representation enhanced by transparent
reasoning mechanisms. Further, the model is demonstrated and evaluated through
instantiation which serves as a basis for further dedicated efforts that aim at
building responsible and trustworthy intelligent systems for assessing the
effects produced by engaging AI systems in military operations.

*Haonan Bian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该调查系统回顾了LLM赋能知识图谱构建的最新进展，分析了LLM如何重塑传统的本体工程、知识抽取和知识融合三层流程，并探讨了基于模式和无模式两种范式的互补视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的出现，知识图谱构建正从基于规则和统计的流程转向语言驱动和生成框架，需要系统梳理这一范式转变及其技术发展。

Method: 首先回顾传统KG方法建立概念基础，然后从基于模式（强调结构、规范化和一致性）和无模式（强调灵活性、适应性和开放发现）两个互补视角分析新兴的LLM驱动方法。

Result: 系统综合了各阶段的代表性框架，分析了技术机制并识别了局限性，为理解LLM与KG的演进关系提供了清晰框架。

Conclusion: 调查明确了关键趋势和未来研究方向，包括基于KG的LLM推理、智能体系统的动态知识记忆和多模态KG构建，旨在弥合符号知识工程与神经语义理解之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have long served as a fundamental infrastructure for
structured knowledge representation and reasoning. With the advent of Large
Language Models (LLMs), the construction of KGs has entered a new
paradigm-shifting from rule-based and statistical pipelines to language-driven
and generative frameworks. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of
recent progress in LLM-empowered knowledge graph construction, systematically
analyzing how LLMs reshape the classical three-layered pipeline of ontology
engineering, knowledge extraction, and knowledge fusion.
  We first revisit traditional KG methodologies to establish conceptual
foundations, and then review emerging LLM-driven approaches from two
complementary perspectives: schema-based paradigms, which emphasize structure,
normalization, and consistency; and schema-free paradigms, which highlight
flexibility, adaptability, and open discovery. Across each stage, we synthesize
representative frameworks, analyze their technical mechanisms, and identify
their limitations.
  Finally, the survey outlines key trends and future research directions,
including KG-based reasoning for LLMs, dynamic knowledge memory for agentic
systems, and multimodal KG construction. Through this systematic review, we aim
to clarify the evolving interplay between LLMs and knowledge graphs, bridging
symbolic knowledge engineering and neural semantic understanding toward the
development of adaptive, explainable, and intelligent knowledge systems.

*Tianyi Zhang,Florian Mai,Lucie Flek*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了IKnow框架，通过指令-响应对话格式制定新的自监督目标，在无需外部资源的情况下持续预训练指令调优模型，避免语义表示退化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续预训练方法需要访问原始基础模型或依赖外部领域知识库，这在基础模型权重因安全原因被保留或可靠外部语料不可用时存在现实障碍。

Method: IKnow框架在指令-响应对话格式中制定新的自监督目标，利用文本中嵌入的领域知识，在更深语义层次进行编码学习。

Result: 该方法能够在不依赖外部资源的情况下，持续适应指令调优模型到新领域，同时保持其指令跟随能力和语义表示。

Conclusion: IKnow提供了一个简单通用的框架，解决了指令调优模型持续预训练中的语义退化问题，无需外部依赖。

Abstract: Continual pretraining promises to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new
domains using only unlabeled test-time data, but naively applying standard
self-supervised objectives to instruction-tuned models is known to degrade
their instruction-following capability and semantic representations. Existing
fixes assume access to the original base model or rely on knowledge from an
external domain-specific database - both of which pose a realistic barrier in
settings where the base model weights are withheld for safety reasons or
reliable external corpora are unavailable. In this work, we propose
Instruction-Knowledge-Aware Continual Adaptation (IKnow), a simple and general
framework that formulates novel self-supervised objectives in the
instruction-response dialogue format. Rather than depend- ing on external
resources, IKnow leverages domain knowledge embedded within the text itself and
learns to encode it at a deeper semantic level.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够生成既新颖又有用的创新机会的计算模型，以提升创新项目的质量。

Method: 实现了五个功能函数，旨在提高创新机会的新颖性而不损失实用性，并在酒店业创新项目中进行评估。

Result: 该计算模型生成的结果在新颖性和/或实用性上优于Notebook LM和ChatGPT4o，但并非所有功能都对提高新颖性有贡献。

Conclusion: 模型在生成新颖创新机会方面表现良好，但部分功能效果有限，为后续模型开发指明了新方向。

Abstract: This paper presents a new computational model of creative outcomes, informed
by creativity theories and techniques, which was implemented to generate more
novel opportunities for innovation projects. The model implemented five
functions that were developed to contribute to the generation of innovation
opportunities with higher novelty without loss of usefulness. The model was
evaluated using opportunities generated for an innovation project in the
hospitality sector. The evaluation revealed that the computational model
generated outcomes that were more novel and/or useful than outcomes from
Notebook LM and ChatGPT4o. However, not all model functions contributed to the
generation of more novel opportunities, leading to new directions for further
model development

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为EBR的神经推理器，通过嵌入来近似符号推理器的结果，解决了传统描述逻辑推理器对不一致和错误数据不鲁棒的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经符号概念学习方法依赖描述逻辑推理器，但这些推理器对知识库中的不一致和错误数据不鲁棒，限制了在真实世界知识库中的应用。

Method: EBR神经推理器使用嵌入来近似符号推理结果，仅需检索原子概念和存在限制的实例，就能近似SHOIQ描述逻辑中任何概念的实例集合。

Result: 实验表明，EBR在缺失和错误数据情况下比现有推理器更鲁棒。

Conclusion: EBR为在真实世界知识库中部署概念学习方法提供了可行的解决方案，通过神经方法克服了传统符号推理器的局限性。

Abstract: Concept learning exploits background knowledge in the form of description
logic axioms to learn explainable classification models from knowledge bases.
Despite recent breakthroughs in neuro-symbolic concept learning, most
approaches still cannot be deployed on real-world knowledge bases. This is due
to their use of description logic reasoners, which are not robust against
inconsistencies nor erroneous data. We address this challenge by presenting a
novel neural reasoner dubbed EBR. Our reasoner relies on embeddings to
approximate the results of a symbolic reasoner. We show that EBR solely
requires retrieving instances for atomic concepts and existential restrictions
to retrieve or approximate the set of instances of any concept in the
description logic $\mathcal{SHOIQ}$. In our experiments, we compare EBR with
state-of-the-art reasoners. Our results suggest that EBR is robust against
missing and erroneous data in contrast to existing reasoners.

TL;DR: FLORA是一种无需训练数据的知识图谱对齐方法，基于模糊逻辑提供可解释的结果，能够同时对齐实体和关系，并在主要基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱对齐方法主要关注实体级对齐，缺乏可解释性推理且需要训练数据。FLORA旨在解决这些问题，提供无需训练数据的全面对齐方案。

Method: 基于模糊逻辑的迭代方法，同时对齐实体和关系，允许存在无对应实体的悬挂实体，并具有可证明的收敛性。

Result: 在主要基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: FLORA是一种简单有效的无监督知识图谱对齐方法，提供可解释的结果并支持实体和关系的全面对齐。

Abstract: Knowledge graph alignment is the task of matching equivalent entities (that
is, instances and classes) and relations across two knowledge graphs. Most
existing methods focus on pure entity-level alignment, computing the similarity
of entities in some embedding space. They lack interpretable reasoning and need
training data to work. In this paper, we propose FLORA, a simple yet effective
method that (1) is unsupervised, i.e., does not require training data, (2)
provides a holistic alignment for entities and relations iteratively, (3) is
based on fuzzy logic and thus delivers interpretable results, (4) provably
converges, (5) allows dangling entities, i.e., entities without a counterpart
in the other KG, and (6) achieves state-of-the-art results on major benchmarks.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了澳大利亚、哥伦比亚和美国三个国家在AI治理中的公众参与情况，发现政府未能建立有效的公众对话机制，参与率极低且反馈响应不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在分析政府在AI治理中如何征求公众意见，以及这些意见是否真正影响政策制定，揭示参与式AI治理的实践与承诺之间的差距。

Method: 采用景观分析方法，比较三个国家政府征求AI风险和政策反馈的方式，以及这些反馈如何影响治理决策。

Result: 研究发现三国参与率均低于人口1%，政府缺乏吸引多样化声音的努力，对收到的反馈响应有限，未能建立有效的反馈循环。

Conclusion: 当前参与式AI治理方法无法建立信任或合法性，作者提出八项改进建议，包括提升AI素养、扩大参与范围、加强反馈响应等。

Abstract: The worlds people have strong opinions about artificial intelligence (AI),
and they want policymakers to listen. Governments are inviting public comment
on AI, but as they translate input into policy, much of what citizens say is
lost. Policymakers are missing a critical opportunity to build trust in AI and
its governance. This paper compares three countries, Australia, Colombia, and
the United States, that invited citizens to comment on AI risks and policies.
Using a landscape analysis, the authors examined how each government solicited
feedback and whether that input shaped governance. Yet in none of the three
cases did citizens and policymakers establish a meaningful dialogue.
Governments did little to attract diverse voices or publicize calls for
comment, leaving most citizens unaware or unprepared to respond. In each
nation, fewer than one percent of the population participated. Moreover,
officials showed limited responsiveness to the feedback they received, failing
to create an effective feedback loop. The study finds a persistent gap between
the promise and practice of participatory AI governance. The authors conclude
that current approaches are unlikely to build trust or legitimacy in AI because
policymakers are not adequately listening or responding to public concerns.
They offer eight recommendations: promote AI literacy; monitor public feedback;
broaden outreach; hold regular online forums; use innovative engagement
methods; include underrepresented groups; respond publicly to input; and make
participation easier.

TL;DR: 提出基于图神经网络加速的电网拓扑优化方法，通过母线分裂缓解输电拥堵，在GOC 2000节点系统上实现4个数量级加速，1分钟内获得AC可行解，最优性差距仅2.3%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有求解器无法在近实时内解决大规模系统的混合整数非线性电网拓扑优化问题，机器学习方法在泛化到未见拓扑、运行条件和不同系统方面存在局限，限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用异构图神经网络，开发边缘感知消息传递神经网络来预测有效的母线分裂动作作为候选拓扑优化解，捕捉局部潮流模式，实现对未见拓扑变化的泛化和跨系统迁移性。

Result: 在GOC 2000节点系统上实现高达4个数量级的加速，1分钟内提供AC可行解，最优性差距为2.3%，展示了在拓扑和跨系统泛化方面向近实时大规模系统拓扑优化迈出的重要一步。

Conclusion: 所提出的GNN加速方法显著提升了电网拓扑优化的计算效率，同时保持了良好的最优性和泛化能力，为实现大规模系统近实时拓扑优化提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Network topology optimization (NTO) via busbar splitting can mitigate
transmission grid congestion and reduce redispatch costs. However, solving this
mixed-integer non-linear problem for large-scale systems in near-real-time is
currently intractable with existing solvers. Machine learning (ML) approaches
have emerged as a promising alternative, but they have limited generalization
to unseen topologies, varying operating conditions, and different systems,
which limits their practical applicability. This paper formulates NTO for
congestion management problem considering linearized AC PF, and proposes a
graph neural network (GNN)-accelerated approach. We develop a heterogeneous
edge-aware message passing NN to predict effective busbar splitting actions as
candidate NTO solutions. The proposed GNN captures local flow patterns,
achieves generalization to unseen topology changes, and improves
transferability across systems. Case studies show up to 4 orders-of-magnitude
speed-up, delivering AC-feasible solutions within one minute and a 2.3%
optimality gap on the GOC 2000-bus system. These results demonstrate a
significant step toward near-real-time NTO for large-scale systems with
topology and cross-system generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出CaSE方法，通过评估推理步骤的相关性和连贯性来改进LLM推理能力，而不仅仅是关注最终答案的正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估LLM主要关注最终答案正确性，这种方法过于粗糙，无法反映推理过程的质量，限制了模型的改进空间。

Method: 引入因果逐步评估(CaSE)方法，将推理质量分解为相关性和连贯性两个维度，仅使用前序上下文评估每个推理步骤，避免后见之明偏差。

Result: 在MRa-GSM8K和MRa-MATH基准测试上验证了CaSE与人工判断的一致性，并证明使用CaSE评估的数据进行训练能直接提升最终任务性能。

Conclusion: CaSE提供了一个可扩展的框架，用于分析、调试和改进LLM推理，展示了超越有效性检查的实际价值。

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on final-answer correctness is the
dominant paradigm. This approach, however, provides a coarse signal for model
improvement and overlooks the quality of the underlying reasoning process. We
argue that a more granular evaluation of reasoning offers a more effective path
to building robust models. We decompose reasoning quality into two dimensions:
relevance and coherence. Relevance measures if a step is grounded in the
problem; coherence measures if it follows logically from prior steps. To
measure these aspects reliably, we introduce causal stepwise evaluation (CaSE).
This method assesses each reasoning step using only its preceding context,
which avoids hindsight bias. We validate CaSE against human judgments on our
new expert-annotated benchmarks, MRa-GSM8K and MRa-MATH. More importantly, we
show that curating training data with CaSE-evaluated relevance and coherence
directly improves final task performance. Our work provides a scalable
framework for analyzing, debugging, and improving LLM reasoning, demonstrating
the practical value of moving beyond validity checks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机游走中心性能够捕捉丰富的图结构信息，但在大型网络中的计算成本过高，现有方法不实用。

Method: 基于新的随机游走中心性公式，开发了两种算法：一种使用近似Cholesky分解和稀疏逆估计，另一种通过采样有根生成树。

Result: 在包括超过1000万个节点的大型真实网络上的实验表明，所提算法具有高效性和良好的近似质量。

Conclusion: 提出的算法能够在近线性时间内有效计算随机游走中心性，为大规模网络分析提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Random walk centrality is a fundamental metric in graph mining for
quantifying node importance and influence, defined as the weighted average of
hitting times to a node from all other nodes. Despite its ability to capture
rich graph structural information and its wide range of applications, computing
this measure for large networks remains impractical due to the computational
demands of existing methods. In this paper, we present a novel formulation of
random walk centrality, underpinning two scalable algorithms: one leveraging
approximate Cholesky factorization and sparse inverse estimation, while the
other sampling rooted spanning trees. Both algorithms operate in near-linear
time and provide strong approximation guarantees. Extensive experiments on
large real-world networks, including one with over 10 million nodes,
demonstrate the efficiency and approximation quality of the proposed
algorithms.

Motivation: 可解释性设计模型对于在现实应用中建立对自动化决策模型的信任、问责和安全采用至关重要。

Method: 定义了监督学习设置，涵盖多种数据类型和决策任务。分析了三类主要可解释模型：特征重要性模型、规则模型和实例模型。为因果性、公平性和隐私性提供了形式化定义、评估指标和验证程序。

Result: 建立了开发不仅准确和可解释，而且公平、保护隐私和具有因果意识的AI系统的理论基础。

Conclusion: MIMOSA框架为构建可信赖的AI系统提供了理论基础，通过在设计阶段评估伦理指标，确保模型在可解释性、性能和伦理属性之间达到平衡。

Abstract: Interpretable-by-design models are crucial for fostering trust,
accountability, and safe adoption of automated decision-making models in
real-world applications. In this paper we formalize the ground for the MIMOSA
(Mining Interpretable Models explOiting Sophisticated Algorithms) framework, a
comprehensive methodology for generating predictive models that balance
interpretability with performance while embedding key ethical properties. We
formally define here the supervised learning setting across diverse
decision-making tasks and data types, including tabular data, time series,
images, text, transactions, and trajectories. We characterize three major
families of interpretable models: feature importance, rule, and instance based
models. For each family, we analyze their interpretability dimensions,
reasoning mechanisms, and complexity. Beyond interpretability, we formalize
three critical ethical properties, namely causality, fairness, and privacy,
providing formal definitions, evaluation metrics, and verification procedures
for each. We then examine the inherent trade-offs between these properties and
discuss how privacy requirements, fairness constraints, and causal reasoning
can be embedded within interpretable pipelines. By evaluating ethical measures
during model generation, this framework establishes the theoretical foundations
for developing AI systems that are not only accurate and interpretable but also
fair, privacy-preserving, and causally aware, i.e., trustworthy.

Motivation: 现有电子商务评估基准存在任务多样性不足、模态有限、数据合成或人工整理、语言覆盖窄等问题，缺乏评估复杂真实购物场景的可靠工具。

Method: 采用半自动流程：大模型生成候选回答，50多名电商和多语言专家审核修改；定义难度等级；主要从真实客户查询和交易日志获取数据。

Result: 构建了一个反映真实业务交互噪声和异构性的基准测试，涵盖多语言（包括5种东南亚低资源语言）和多模态任务。

Conclusion: EcomEval填补了电子商务领域评估基准的空白，为复杂真实购物场景的模型评估提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel on general-purpose NLP benchmarks, yet
their capabilities in specialized domains remain underexplored. In e-commerce,
existing evaluations-such as EcomInstruct, ChineseEcomQA, eCeLLM, and Shopping
MMLU-suffer from limited task diversity (e.g., lacking product guidance and
after-sales issues), limited task modalities (e.g., absence of multimodal
data), synthetic or curated data, and a narrow focus on English and Chinese,
leaving practitioners without reliable tools to assess models on complex,
real-world shopping scenarios. We introduce EcomEval, a comprehensive
multilingual and multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs in e-commerce.
EcomEval covers six categories and 37 tasks (including 8 multimodal tasks),
sourced primarily from authentic customer queries and transaction logs,
reflecting the noisy and heterogeneous nature of real business interactions. To
ensure both quality and scalability of reference answers, we adopt a
semi-automatic pipeline in which large models draft candidate responses
subsequently reviewed and modified by over 50 expert annotators with strong
e-commerce and multilingual expertise. We define difficulty levels for each
question and task category by averaging evaluation scores across models with
different sizes and capabilities, enabling challenge-oriented and fine-grained
assessment. EcomEval also spans seven languages-including five low-resource
Southeast Asian languages-offering a multilingual perspective absent from prior
work.

Method: 通过测量模型对环境状态变化的理解、预测和调整能力来评估适应性，强调真正超级智能模型应具备至少二阶适应性。

Result: 建立了Fluidity Index评估框架，能够系统性地测试模型在动态环境中的上下文切换和连续性表现。

Conclusion: 真正超级智能的模型需要具备至少二阶适应性，通过数字补充实现自持续计算，以达到最佳流动性。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Fluidity Index (FI) to quantify model adaptability
in dynamic, scaling environments. The benchmark evaluates response accuracy
based on deviations in initial, current, and future environment states,
assessing context switching and continuity. We distinguish between closed-ended
and open-ended benchmarks, prioritizing closed-loop open-ended real-world
benchmarks to test adaptability. The approach measures a model's ability to
understand, predict, and adjust to state changes in scaling environments. A
truly super-intelligent model should exhibit at least second-order
adaptability, enabling self-sustained computation through digital replenishment
for optimal fluidity.

Abstract: Thanks to the remarkable human-like capabilities of machine learning (ML)

TL;DR: 提出基于拓扑数据分析的评估框架，用于自动评估大语言模型推理轨迹的质量，相比传统图指标具有更高预测能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估大语言模型推理轨迹质量的方法存在不足：依赖专家评分、人工标注和缓慢的成对判断，自动化方法主要使用基于图的代理指标，但过于简化复杂推理过程

Method: 引入拓扑数据分析框架，捕捉推理轨迹的几何特征，实现标签高效的自动评估

Result: 拓扑特征在评估推理质量方面比标准图指标具有显著更高的预测能力，表明有效推理更适合用高维几何结构而非纯关系图来捕捉

Conclusion: 紧凑稳定的拓扑特征集能可靠指示轨迹质量，为未来强化学习算法提供实用信号

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of reasoning traces from large language models remains
understudied, labor-intensive, and unreliable: current practice relies on
expert rubrics, manual annotation, and slow pairwise judgments. Automated
efforts are dominated by graph-based proxies that quantify structural
connectivity but do not clarify what constitutes high-quality reasoning; such
abstractions can be overly simplistic for inherently complex processes. We
introduce a topological data analysis (TDA)-based evaluation framework that
captures the geometry of reasoning traces and enables label-efficient,
automated assessment. In our empirical study, topological features yield
substantially higher predictive power for assessing reasoning quality than
standard graph metrics, suggesting that effective reasoning is better captured
by higher-dimensional geometric structures rather than purely relational
graphs. We further show that a compact, stable set of topological features
reliably indicates trace quality, offering a practical signal for future
reinforcement learning algorithms.

TL;DR: Graph-RFT是一个两阶段强化微调KGQA框架，通过'计划-KG搜索-网络搜索-思考'范式，使LLM能够在知识不完整条件下进行自主规划和跨KG与网络来源的自适应检索调度。


<details>

Motivation: 现有KGQA方法难以充分利用KG中的丰富知识和LLM的推理能力，特别是在复杂场景下。它们通常假设KG覆盖完整，缺乏判断何时需要外部信息的机制，且推理过程局部短视，无法保持连贯的多步规划。

Method: 提出两阶段方法：1) 使用定制化计划-检索数据集进行思维链微调，激活结构化推理；2) 引入计划-检索引导的强化学习过程，整合显式规划和检索动作，采用笛卡尔式规划模块分解复杂问题，使用逻辑表达式指导工具调用。

Result: 该方法通过多奖励设计（结合结果和检索特定信号）优化推理检索过程，使模型学习何时以及如何有效结合KG和网络检索。

Conclusion: Graph-RFT框架能够解决GRPO冷启动问题，实现覆盖感知的检索调度和全局一致的多步推理，在知识不完整条件下提升KGQA性能。

advanced KGQA through their strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods
continue to struggle to fully exploit both the rich knowledge encoded in KGs
and the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in complex scenarios. They
often assume complete KG coverage and lack mechanisms to judge when external
information is needed, and their reasoning remains locally myopic, failing to
maintain coherent multi-step planning, leading to reasoning failures even when
relevant knowledge exists. We propose Graph-RFT, a novel two-stage
reinforcement fine-tuning KGQA framework with a
'plan-KGsearch-and-Websearch-during-think' paradigm, that enables LLMs to
perform autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval scheduling across KG and web
sources under incomplete knowledge conditions. Graph-RFT introduces a
chain-of-thought fine-tuning method with a customized plan-retrieval dataset
activates structured reasoning and resolves the GRPO cold-start problem. It
then introduces a novel plan-retrieval guided reinforcement learning process
integrates explicit planning and retrieval actions with a multi-reward design,
enabling coverage-aware retrieval scheduling. It employs a Cartesian-inspired
planning module to decompose complex questions into ordered subquestions, and
logical expression to guide tool invocation for globally consistent multi-step
reasoning. This reasoning retrieval process is optimized with a multi-reward
combining outcome and retrieval specific signals, enabling the model to learn
when and how to combine KG and web retrieval effectively.

### [288] [A Coherence-Based Measure of AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20784)
*Fares Fourati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于广义均值积分的一致性感知AGI度量方法，替代了传统算术平均方法，能更好地衡量跨认知领域的平衡能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AGI定义使用算术平均，假设领域间能力可补偿，但真正的通用智能应该反映跨所有必要领域的平衡能力。

Method: 提出基于广义均值在补偿性指数连续统上积分的度量方法，涵盖算术、几何和调和均值机制，通过曲线下面积量化不同补偿性假设下的稳健性。

Result: 应用于GPT-4和GPT-5的CHC领域得分，一致性调整的AUC显示两者距离通用能力仍很远，尽管算术得分较高（GPT-5为24%）。

Conclusion: 集成广义均值提供了一个原则性、可解释且更严格的AGI进展测量基础，能惩罚不平衡并捕捉领域间依赖性。

Abstract: Recent work by \citet{hendrycks2025agidefinition} formalized
\textit{Artificial General Intelligence} (AGI) as the arithmetic mean of
proficiencies across cognitive domains derived from the Cattell--Horn--Carroll
(CHC) model of human cognition. While elegant, this definition assumes
\textit{compensability} -- that exceptional ability in some domains can offset
failure in others. True general intelligence, however, should reflect
\textit{coherent sufficiency}: balanced competence across all essential
domains. We propose a coherence-aware measure of AGI based on the integral of
generalized means over a continuum of compensability exponents. This
formulation spans arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic regimes, and the
resulting \textit{area under the curve} (AUC) quantifies robustness under
varying compensability assumptions. Unlike the arithmetic mean, which rewards
specialization, the AUC penalizes imbalance and captures inter-domain
dependency. Applied to published CHC-based domain scores for GPT-4 and GPT-5,
the coherence-adjusted AUC reveals that both systems remain far from general
competence despite high arithmetic scores (e.g., GPT-5 at~24\%). Integrating
the generalized mean thus yields a principled, interpretable, and stricter
foundation for measuring genuine progress toward AGI.

the construction of the RDR pipeline, while the appendix provides extensive
results across each analyzed topic. We hope this work sheds light for
researchers working in the field of AI and beyond.

Abstract: We present a new subspace iteration method for computing low-lying eigenpairs
(excited states) of high-dimensional quantum many-body Hamiltonians with
nearest neighbor interactions on two-dimensional lattices. The method is based
on a new block isometric projected entangled pair state (block-isoPEPS) ansatz
that generalizes the block matrix product state (MPS) framework, widely used
for Hamiltonians defined on one-dimensional chains, to two-dimensions. The
proposed block-isoPEPS ansatz offers several attractive features for PEPS-based
algorithms, including exact block orthogonalization, controlled local
truncation via singular value decompositions, and efficient evaluation of
observables. We demonstrate the proposed inexact subspace iteration for
block-isoPEPS by computing excitations of the two-dimensional transverse-field
Ising and Heisenberg models and compare our results with existing PEPS methods.
Our results demonstrate that block isometric tensor networks provide a scalable
framework for studying excitations in quantum many-body systems beyond one
dimension.

Abstract: Given the set of discrete solution points or nodes, called the skeleton,
generated by an ODE solver, we study the problem of fitting a curve passing
through the nodes in the skeleton minimizing a norm of the residual vector of
the ODE. We reformulate this interpolation problem as a multi-stage optimal
control problem and, for the minimization of two different norms, we apply the
associated maximum principle to obtain the necessary conditions of optimality.
We solve the problem analytically for the Dahlquist test problem and a variant
of the leaky bucket problem, in terms of the given skeleton. We also consider
the Van der Pol equation, for which we obtain interpolating curves with minimal
residual norms by numerically solving a direct discretization of the problem
through optimization software. With the skeletons obtained by various ODE
solvers of MATLAB, we make comparisons between the residuals obtained by our
approach and those obtained by the MATLAB function deval.

*Yao Xiao,Anne Gelb*

TL;DR: 将残差变换算子重新表述为分层贝叶斯框架中的新先验，实现不确定性量化和多模态数据的联合信号恢复


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统信号恢复先验假设信号变异性类型已知且固定，但复杂信号在不同区域可能表现出不同行为，这一假设存在问题

Method: 在分层贝叶斯框架中重新表述残差变换算子作为新先验，支持不确定性量化和多模态测量数据的联合恢复

Result: 数值实验表明残差先验能从多模态数据中实现高保真信号和图像恢复，并提供稳健的不确定性量化

Conclusion: 残差先验为复杂信号恢复提供了无需先验结构信息的强大框架，支持不确定性量化和多模态数据融合

Abstract: Conventional priors used for signal recovery are often limited by the
assumption that the type of a signal's variability, such as piecewise constant
or linear behavior, is known and fixed. This assumption is problematic for
complex signals that exhibit different behaviors across the domain. The
recently developed {\em residual transform operator} effectively reduces such
variability-dependent error within the LASSO regression framework. Importantly,
it does not require prior information regarding structure of the underlying
signal. This paper reformulates the residual transform operator into a new
prior within a hierarchical Bayesian framework. In so doing, it unlocks two
powerful new capabilities. First, it enables principled uncertainty
quantification, providing robust credible intervals for the recovered signal,
and second, it provides a natural framework for the joint recovery of signals
from multimodal measurements by coherently fusing information from disparate
data sources. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the residual prior yields
high-fidelity signal and image recovery from multimodal data while providing
robust uncertainty quantification.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的广义变换神经网络(GTNNs)，包括立方变换神经网络(CTNNs)和二次变换神经网络(QTNNs)，用于高维逼近问题。相比传统神经网络，GTNNs在逼近振荡函数时具有更高的精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度神经网络在梯度下降训练下，特别是当目标函数是振荡函数时，逼近精度有时较低。需要改进神经元的仿射变换为更一般的函数，以提升逼近能力。

Method: 将抽象神经元的仿射变换推广为更一般的函数，作为复杂形状函数。具体提出了CTNNs和QTNNs两种广义变换神经网络。

Result: 对CTNNs和QTNNs进行了逼近误差分析，证明了它们对连续函数的通用逼近性质，以及对光滑函数和Barron型函数的误差界。数值实验表明CTNNs/QTNNs在回归问题和偏微分方程中比传统全连接神经网络具有精度和鲁棒性优势。

Conclusion: GTNNs通过推广神经元的变换函数，有效提升了神经网络在高维逼近问题中的性能，特别是在处理振荡函数时表现优异。

Abstract: We propose a novel class of neural network-like parametrized functions, i.e.,
general transformation neural networks (GTNNs), for high-dimensional
approximation. Conventional deep neural networks sometimes perform less
accurately in approximation problems under gradient descent training,
especially when the target function is oscillatory. To improve accuracy, we
generalize the affine transformation of the abstract neuron to more general
functions, which act as complex shape functions and have larger capacities.
Specifically, we introduce two types of GTNNs: the cubic and quadratic
transformation neural networks (CTNNs and QTNNs). We perform approximation
error analysis for CTNNs and QTNNs, presenting their universal approximation
properties for continuous functions and error bounds for smooth functions and
Barron-type functions. Several numerical examples of regression problems and
partial differential equations are presented, demonstrating that CTNNs/QTNNs
have advantages in accuracy and robustness over conventional fully connected
neural networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无网格方法在湍流模拟中广泛使用，但其精度通常仅通过多项式一致性来评估，很少关注逼近的分辨能力。本文旨在优化无网格方法的分辨能力

Method: 利用核函数的非唯一性，通过核函数的线性组合来最大化在一定波数范围内的分辨能力，改进空间导数的数值逼近

Result: 新方法在收敛测试中显示出改进的精度，对时间相关问题的稳定性影响很小，在多种PDE系统求解中显著提高了精度且不增加计算成本

Conclusion: 所提出的优化程序提供的改进分辨率特性使得能够准确模拟包含短空间尺度的PDE系统，如具有均匀各向同性湍流的流场

Abstract: Meshless methods are commonly used to determine numerical solutions to
partial differential equations (PDEs) for problems involving free surfaces
and/or complex geometries, approximating spatial derivatives at collocation
points via local kernels with a finite size. Despite their common use in
turbulent flow simulations, the accuracy of meshless methods has typically been
assessed using their convergence characteristics resulting from the polynomial
consistency of approximations to operators, with little to no attention paid to
the resolving power of the approximation. Here we provide a framework for the
optimisation of resolving power by exploiting the non-uniqueness of kernels to
provide improvements to numerical approximations of spatial derivatives. We
first demonstrate that, unlike in finite-difference approximations, the
resolving power of meshless methods is dependent not only on the magnitude of
the wavenumber, but also its orientation, before using linear combinations of
kernels to maximise resolving power over a range of wavenumbers. The new
approach shows improved accuracy in convergence tests and has little impact on
stability of time-dependent problems for a range of Eulerian meshless methods.
Solutions to a variety of PDE systems are computed, with significant gains in
accuracy for no extra computational cost per timestep in Eulerian frameworks.
The improved resolution characteristics provided by the optimisation procedure
presented herein enable accurate simulation of systems of PDEs whose solution
contains short spatial scales such as flow fields with homogeneous isotropic
turbulence.

Result: 数值实验表明IEnSF显著减少了非线性设置中的后验评分估计误差，提高了高维动力系统跟踪精度

Conclusion: IEnSF算法通过迭代改进条件期望近似，有效解决了非线性数据同化中的后验评分估计问题

Abstract: The Ensemble Score Filter (EnSF) has emerged as a promising approach to
leverage score-based diffusion models for solving high-dimensional and
nonlinear data assimilation problems. While initial applications of EnSF to the
Lorenz-96 model and the quasi-geostrophic system showed potential, the current
method employs a heuristic weighted sum to combine the prior and the likelihood
score functions. This introduces a structural error into the estimation of the
posterior score function in the nonlinear setting. This work addresses this
challenge by developing an iterative ensemble score filter (IEnSF) that applies
an iterative algorithm as an outer loop around the reverse-time stochastic
differential equation solver. When the state dynamics or the observation
operator is nonlinear, the iterative algorithm can gradually reduce the
posterior score estimation error by improving the accuracy of approximating the
conditional expectation of the likelihood score function. The number of
iterations required depends on the distance between the prior and posterior
distributions and the nonlinearity of the observation operator. Numerical
experiments demonstrate that the IEnSF algorithm substantially reduces the
error in posterior score estimation in the nonlinear setting and thus improves
the accuracy of tracking high-dimensional dynamical systems.

Abstract: We consider a unique continuation problem for the wave equation given data in
a volumetric subset of the space time domain. In the absence of data on the
lateral boundary of the space-time cylinder we prove that the solution can be
continued with H\"older stability into a certain proper subset of the
space-time domain. Additionally, we show that unique continuation of the
solution to the entire space-time cylinder with Lipschitz stability is possible
given the knowledge of a suitable finite dimensional space in which the trace
of the solution on the lateral boundary is contained. These results allow us to
design a finite element method that provably converges to the exact solution at
a rate that mirrors the stability properties of the continuous problem.

Abstract: Offshore wind and wave energy offer high energy density and availability.
While offshore wind has matured significantly, wave energy remains costly and
under development. Integrating both technologies into a hybrid system can
enhance power generation, stabilize output, and reduce costs. This study
explores the benefits of combining an offshore floating wind turbine with the
two-body heaving point absorber wave energy converter, Reference Model 3 (RM3).
Six configurations are analyzed: RM3 integrated with the National Renewable
Energy Laboratory 5 MW and the International Energy Agency 15 MW wind turbines,
each tested on both spar and semi-submersible platforms. The analysis examines
dynamic response, mooring loads, and power production under varying
environmental conditions, considering the influence of the wave energy
converter float motion and an optional reaction plate. Results indicate that
the reaction plate improves damping for the spar platform, enhancing wave
energy absorption and power output. A comparative analysis indicates that
integrating the wave energy converter reduces its levelized cost of energy by
15-83%, while leaving the wind turbine levelized cost of energy unaffected.
Hybridization significantly reduces power fluctuations by 50%, reduces the
levelized cost of energy with the 5 MW wind turbine, and slightly increases it
with the 15 MW wind turbine. The results highlight a mutualistic relationship
between the wave energy converter and the offshore wind turbine, where the
former benefits substantially while the latter experiences slight improvements
or negligible effects. Additional findings quantify hydrodynamic interactions,
mooring performance, and economic feasibility. This research provides insights
into optimizing hybrid offshore renewable systems, demonstrating their
potential to lower costs and support sustainable energy solutions.

Abstract: We study Maxwell's equations in conducting media with perfectly conducting
boundary conditions on Lipschitz domains, allowing rough material coefficients
and $L^2$-data. Our first contribution is a direct proof of well-posedness of
the first-order weak formulation, including solution existence and uniqueness,
an energy identity, and continuous dependence on the data. The argument uses
interior-in-time mollification to show uniqueness while avoiding reflection
techniques. Existence is via the well-known Galerkin method (cf.~Duvaut and
Lions \cite[Eqns.~(4.31)--(4.32), p.~346; Thm.~4.1]{GDuvaut_JLLions_1976a}).
For completeness, and to make the paper self-contained, a complete proof has
been provided.
  Our second contribution is a structure-preserving semi-discrete finite
element method based on the N\'ed\'elec/Raviart--Thomas de Rham complex. The
scheme preserves a discrete Gauss law for all times and satisfies a
continuous-in-time energy identity with stability for nonnegative conductivity.
With a divergence-free initialization of the magnetic field (via potential
reconstruction or constrained $L^2$ projection), we prove convergence of the
semi-discrete solutions to the unique weak solution as the mesh is refined. The
analysis mostly relies on projector consistency, weak-* compactness in
time-bounded $L^2$ spaces, and identification of time derivatives in dual
spaces.

learning models are gaining popularity in solving this problem due to their
ability to learn complex patterns from data and generalize across diverse
conditions. Among these, diffusion models have emerged as particularly powerful
in generative tasks, producing high-quality samples by iteratively refining
noisy inputs. In contrast to other methods, these generative models are capable
of reconstructing the smallest scales of the fluid spectrum. In this work, we
introduce a novel sampling method for diffusion models that enables the
reconstruction of high-fidelity samples by guiding the reverse process using
the available sparse data. Moreover, we enhance the reconstructions with
available physics knowledge using a conflict-free update method during
training. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments
on 2 and 3-dimensional turbulent flow data. Our method consistently outperforms
other diffusion-based methods in predicting the fluid's structure and in
pixel-wise accuracy. This study underscores the remarkable potential of
diffusion models in reconstructing flow field data, paving the way for their
application in Computational Fluid Dynamics research.

TL;DR: 研究发现，在波浪聚焦区域，传统线性叠加方法低估了平均拉格朗日漂移达30%，提出了基于拉格朗日参考系的新方法来准确预测局部平均漂移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法假设多个表面重力波的拉格朗日漂移可以独立计算后叠加，但这种方法在波浪聚焦区域可能不准确。

Method: 结合实验室测量和完全非线性模拟，推导出在拉格朗日参考系中约束局部平均漂移的新方法，并基于非线性薛定谔方程推导高阶表达式。

Result: 在波浪聚焦区域，局部平均输运比线性叠加预测高出30%，理论预测与实验结果吻合，特别是在带宽较小的波包中。

Conclusion: 波浪场的局部陡度（而非线性波分量陡度的简单叠加）决定了拉格朗日漂移的增强程度。

Abstract: Irrotational and monochromatic surface gravity waves possess a mean
Lagrangian drift which transports mass and enhances mixing in the upper ocean.
In the ocean, where many surface waves are present, it is commonly assumed that
the mean Lagrangian drift can be computed independently for each wave component
and summed. Here we show, using laboratory measurements and fully nonlinear
simulations of steep focusing wave packets, that this assumption underpredicts
the average transport in regions of wave focusing by up to 30%. To explain
these enhancements, we derive a new exact method for constraining the local
mean Lagrangian drift in general flows by working in the Lagrangian reference
frame. From this method, we derive a higher-order expression for the local mean
Lagrangian drift in narrow-banded wave fields governed by the nonlinear
Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) that predicts near-surface enhancements when
waves focus and steepen. The theoretical predictions of the local transport
agree with the experiments, particularly for smaller bandwidth packets where
the NLSE approximation is most valid. These findings highlight that it is the
local steepness of the wave field, not just the sum of the steepnesses of the
linear (non-interacting) wave components, which sets the strength of these
enhancements.

Result: 识别了三种相互作用机制：线状机制（T_D≤0.05）、切割机制（中等T_D）和壁面机制（T_D≥0.8），其中机制转换主要取决于T_D，而增加Re_Γ会增强涡动力学。

Conclusion: 研究结果提供了理解涡体相互作用的统一框架，弥合了涡环、涡管和壁面碰撞动力学之间的差距，并表明初级涡环的重新连接和恢复关键取决于次级涡度的拓扑结构。

Abstract: We investigate the interaction between vortex rings and cylindrical obstacles
using direct numerical simulations across a wide range of geometric and
dynamical parameters. The flow is characterized in terms of the diameter ratio
between ring and object $T_D = d/D$, the Reynolds number based on circulation
$Re_\Gamma$, and the slenderness ratio $\Lambda$. By systematically varying
$T_D$ and $Re_\Gamma$, we identify three distinct interaction regimes: the
wire, cutting, and wall regimes. In the wire regime ($T_D \lesssim 0.05$), the
primary vortex ring survives the interaction with limited deformation and
carries a weak lobe of secondary vorticity generated by the object's boundary
layer. As $T_D$ increases, the interaction transitions to the cutting regime,
where the ring is split into two secondary structures formed through the
reconnection between boundary-layer and ring vorticity. For sufficiently large
obstacles ($T_D \gtrsim 0.8$), the wall regime emerges, in which boundary-layer
vorticity dominates and the primary ring is deflected and stretched along the
obstacle surface. The transition between regimes depends primarily on $T_D$,
while increasing $Re_\Gamma$ enhances vortical dynamics producing additional
small-scale and tertiary structures. Finally, by modifying the topology of the
obstacle, we demonstrate that reconnection and recovery of the primary ring
depend critically on the topology of the secondary vorticity. These results
provide a unified framework for interpreting vortex-body interactions, bridging
the gap between vortex ring, tube, and wall collision dynamics.

TL;DR: 本研究通过高压微流控实验系统研究了氢气注入盐水和含氨盐水时的盐结晶现象，揭示了氢气诱导沉淀与CO2系统的根本差异，并评估了化学添加剂对结晶的抑制效果。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可再生能源整合需要地下储氢和储氨，但注气过程中的盐沉淀可能威胁储存性能。与CO2系统广泛研究不同，氢-盐水和氨-盐水系统中的沉淀机制尚不清楚。

Method: 使用高压微流控技术进行81次实验，系统改变盐水成分(1-5 mol/kg NaCl)、化学添加剂(表面活性剂、醇类、氨)和氢气流速(200-1300 mL/min)，并进行定量图像分析。

Result: 氢气通过蒸发和毛细管捕获驱动物理沉淀，产生离散的局部沉积；而CO2-氨系统产生广泛的反应性碳酸氢铵沉淀。界面张力控制残余盐水分布和最终晶体覆盖度，化学添加剂可抑制沉淀，氨却反常增加晶体分数。

Conclusion: 地下储氢设计需要基于气体特异性而非CO2类比的风险评估，化学添加剂的有效性为近井筒保护提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Underground storage of hydrogen and ammonia in geological formations is
essential for renewable energy integration, but salt precipitation during gas
injection may threaten storage performance. While extensively studied for CO2
systems, precipitation mechanisms in hydrogen-brine and ammonia-brine systems
remain poorly understood. This study presents a comprehensive microfluidic
investigation of salt crystallization during hydrogen injection into saline and
ammonia-containing brines using high-pressure microfluidics. We conducted 81
high-pressure experiments systematically varying brine composition (1-5 mol/kg
NaCl), chemical additives (surfactants, alcohols, ammonia), and hydrogen flow
rates (200-1300 mL/min). Quantitative image analysis reveals that
hydrogen-induced precipitation differs fundamentally from CO2 systems. Hydrogen
drives physical precipitation via evaporation and capillary trapping, producing
discrete, localized deposits. In contrast, CO2-ammonia systems generate
extensive reactive precipitation of ammonium bicarbonate with interconnected
crystal networks. Interfacial tension (IFT) controls both residual brine
distribution and final crystal coverage: high-IFT fluids form large,
interconnected brine pools promoting extensive crystallization, while low-IFT
fluids create isolated pools reducing crystal coverage by 50\%. Alcohol and
surfactant additives suppress precipitation by enhancing brine mobility,
whereas ammonia paradoxically increases crystal fractions despite lower IFT.
Higher flow rates accelerate crystallization across all compositions, enabling
operational mitigation strategies. and demonstrate that gas-specific, rather
than CO2-analog, risk assessments are essential for underground hydrogen
storage design. The effectiveness of chemical additives offers promising
pathways for near-wellbore protection in underground hydrogen storage
operations.

TL;DR: 研究气泡在周期性体积振荡驱动下在高粘度剪切稀化流体中的上升动力学，发现外部压力驱动可显著提高气泡的平均上升速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究外部压力振荡如何影响气泡在剪切稀化流体中的上升行为，探索非线性效应和速度增强机制

Method: 采用轴对称直接数值模拟，使用Carreau-Yasuda模型描述流体流变行为，参数化研究压力驱动振幅、频率和气泡半径的影响

Result: 外部压力振荡导致气泡体积变化，使周围流体粘度变稀，上升动力学呈现高度非线性和非稳态特征，周期平均上升速度比自然上升速度提高数个数量级

Conclusion: 非线性效应随压力驱动振幅、频率和气泡半径增加而增强，数值模拟与实验在平均上升速度方面定性一致，但存在定量差异，可能源于将流体建模为广义牛顿流体而非粘弹性流体

Abstract: We study the rising dynamics of a bubble driven into periodic volumetric
oscillations by an external pressure driving within a highly viscous
shear-thinning fluid. We perform axisymmetric direct numerical simulations
employing the Carreau-Yasuda model to describe the rheological behavior of the
fluid. We carry out a parametric study of the bubble rising dynamics, changing
the amplitude and the frequency of the external pressure driving, and the
bubble radius. Due to the external pressure oscillations, the bubble undergoes
volume changes that strain the liquid at much larger rates than those due to
natural rising, causing the surrounding fluid viscosity to thin. The numerical
results show that the rising dynamics become highly nonlinear and unsteady due
to the interplay of the shear-thinning rheology and the external driving. As a
result, the period-averaged rising velocity of the bubble can increase by
orders of magnitude compared to its natural rising velocity. These nonlinear
effects become progressively more important as the amplitude and the frequency
of the pressure driving or the bubble radius are increased. Qualitatively, the
simulation model agrees with previous experimental findings in terms of average
rising velocity. However, the experiments exhibit terminal velocities that are
smaller than those predicted numerically, along with differences in bubble
shape during the ascent. These discrepancies may be attributed to modeling the
fluid rheology as a generalized Newtonian fluid rather than as a viscoelastic
one.

Abstract: Artificial viscosity is commonly employed in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics
(SPH) to model dissipation in hydrodynamic simulations. However, its practical
implementation relies on complex numerical switches to restrict its application
to regions where dissipation is physically warranted, such as shocks. These
switches, while essential, are imperfect and can introduce additional numerical
noise. In this work we develop and validate a more efficient artificial
viscosity scheme for SPH that does not rely on heuristic switches. Recent
studies have proposed that subtracting the linear component of the velocity
field can suppress spurious dissipation in shear-dominated regions. Building on
this idea, we implement a velocity-reconstruction technique that removes the
bulk linear motion from the local velocity field and uses the Balsara
correction to modulate the dissipation. The presented methodology yields a
balanced dissipation scheme that performs well across a range of regimes,
including subsonic instabilities, shear flows, and strong shocks. We
demonstrate that this approach yields improved accuracy and lower spurious
dissipation compared to conventional artificial viscosity switches

Abstract: We present a history matching (HM) workflow applied to the International
FluidFlower benchmark study dataset, which features high-resolution images of
CO$_2$ storage in a meter-scale, geologically complex reservoir. The dataset
provides dense spatial and temporal observations of fluid displacement,
offering a rare opportunity to validate and enhance HM techniques for
geological carbon storage (GCS). The combination of detailed experimental data
and direct visual observation of flow behavior at this scale is novel and
valuable. This study explores the potential and limitations of using
experimental data to calibrate standard models for GCS simulation. By
leveraging high-resolution images and resulting interpretations of fluid phase
distributions, we adjust uncertain parameters and reduce the mismatch between
simulation results and observed data. Simulations are performed using the
open-source OPM Flow simulator, while the open-source Everest decision-making
tool is employed to conduct the HM. After the HM process, the final simulation
results show good agreement with the experimental CO$_2$ storage data. This
suggests that the system can be effectively described using standard flow
equations, conventional saturation functions, and typical PVT properties for
CO$_2$-brine mixtures. Our results demonstrate that the Wasserstein distance is
a particularly effective metric for matching multi-phase, multi-component flow
data. The entire workflow is implemented in a Python package named pofff
(Python OPM Flow FluidFlower), which organizes all functionality through a
single input file. This design ensures reproducibility and facilitates future
extensions of the study.
