### [1] [Enhancing the Quality of 3D Lunar Maps Using JAXA's Kaguya Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11817)
*Yumi Iwashita,Haakon Moe,Yang Cheng,Adnan Ansar,Georgios Georgakis,Adrian Stoica,Kazuto Nakashima,Ryo Kurazume,Jim Torresen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进Kaguya TC图像生成3D月球地图质量的方法，通过减少压缩图像生成的视差图中的残余噪声来提升高程精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着月球探索任务增加，高质量3D月球地图需求日益迫切，特别是长距离任务如NASA的Endurance任务。Kaguya TC图像虽然全球覆盖，但存在立体匹配误差和JPEG压缩伪影导致的高程不准确问题。

Method: 分析Kaguya TC图像的压缩行为，识别系统性视差噪声模式（尤其在暗区），提出减少压缩图像视差图中残余噪声的方法来增强3D地图质量。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提方法能有效减少高程噪声，提高地形数据的安全性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 该方法能显著改善Kaguya TC图像生成的3D月球地图质量，为未来月球任务提供更安全可靠的地形数据。

Abstract: As global efforts to explore the Moon intensify, the need for high-quality 3D
lunar maps becomes increasingly critical-particularly for long-distance
missions such as NASA's Endurance mission concept, in which a rover aims to
traverse 2,000 km across the South Pole-Aitken basin. Kaguya TC (Terrain
Camera) images, though globally available at 10 m/pixel, suffer from altitude
inaccuracies caused by stereo matching errors and JPEG-based compression
artifacts. This paper presents a method to improve the quality of 3D maps
generated from Kaguya TC images, focusing on mitigating the effects of
compression-induced noise in disparity maps. We analyze the compression
behavior of Kaguya TC imagery, and identify systematic disparity noise
patterns, especially in darker regions. In this paper, we propose an approach
to enhance 3D map quality by reducing residual noise in disparity images
derived from compressed images. Our experimental results show that the proposed
approach effectively reduces elevation noise, enhancing the safety and
reliability of terrain data for future lunar missions.

### [2] [Data or Language Supervision: What Makes CLIP Better than DINO?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11835)
*Yiming Liu,Yuhui Zhang,Dhruba Ghosh,Ludwig Schmidt,Serena Yeung-Levy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP在视觉语言模型中优于DINO，但优势来源不明。通过控制实验发现CLIP擅长高级语义特征，DINO擅长低级视觉特征，在VQA任务中各有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究CLIP在视觉语言模型中优于自监督模型DINO的原因，是源于语言监督还是更大训练数据。

Method: 在相同架构、数据集和训练配置下预训练CLIP和DINO，分析嵌入特征，并在20个VQA基准上评估它们在视觉语言模型中的表现。

Result: CLIP捕捉高级语义（对象类别、文本），DINO对低级特征（颜色、风格）更敏感；CLIP在文本密集型任务中表现更好，DINO在视觉中心任务中略胜一筹。

Conclusion: 语言监督变体带来的增益有限，研究为视觉编码器设计及其对VLM性能影响提供了科学见解。

Abstract: CLIP outperforms self-supervised models like DINO as vision encoders for
vision-language models (VLMs), but it remains unclear whether this advantage
stems from CLIP's language supervision or its much larger training data. To
disentangle these factors, we pre-train CLIP and DINO under controlled settings
-- using the same architecture, dataset, and training configuration --
achieving similar ImageNet accuracy. Embedding analysis shows that CLIP
captures high-level semantics (e.g., object categories, text), while DINO is
more responsive to low-level features like colors and styles. When integrated
into VLMs and evaluated on 20 VQA benchmarks, CLIP excels at text-intensive
tasks, while DINO slightly outperforms on vision-centric ones. Variants of
language supervision (e.g., sigmoid loss, pre-trained language encoders) yield
limited gains. Our findings provide scientific insights into vision encoder
design and its impact on VLM performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MammoDINO是一个用于乳腺X线摄影的自监督学习框架，在140万张乳腺图像上预训练，通过创新的数据增强和对比学习目标，在多个乳腺癌筛查任务中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习在通用领域已成功应用，但在医学影像中由于数据有限和领域特定偏差而未被充分利用。本文旨在为乳腺X线摄影开发有效的自监督学习框架。

Method: 提出MammoDINO框架，包含乳腺组织感知数据增强采样器（图像级和块级监督）和跨切片对比学习目标，将3D数字乳腺断层合成结构融入2D预训练。

Result: 在多个乳腺癌筛查任务中达到最先进性能，在五个基准数据集上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MammoDINO为乳腺X线摄影提供了一个可扩展、无需标注的多用途计算机辅助诊断基础工具，有助于减轻放射科医生工作负担并提高乳腺癌筛查效率。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has transformed vision encoder training in
general domains but remains underutilized in medical imaging due to limited
data and domain specific biases. We present MammoDINO, a novel SSL framework
for mammography, pretrained on 1.4 million mammographic images. To capture
clinically meaningful features, we introduce a breast tissue aware data
augmentation sampler for both image-level and patch-level supervision and a
cross-slice contrastive learning objective that leverages 3D digital breast
tomosynthesis (DBT) structure into 2D pretraining. MammoDINO achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple breast cancer screening tasks and
generalizes well across five benchmark datasets. It offers a scalable,
annotation-free foundation for multipurpose computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
tools for mammogram, helping reduce radiologists' workload and improve
diagnostic efficiency in breast cancer screening.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通安分析需要复杂的视频理解来捕捉细粒度行为模式并生成全面描述以预防事故，现有方法存在任务干扰问题。

Method: 采用双模型框架，VideoLLaMA专门负责captioning任务，Qwen2.5-VL专门负责VQA任务，通过分离训练策略减少任务干扰。

Conclusion: 分离训练策略比联合训练在VQA准确率上提升8.6%，同时保持captioning质量，证明了任务专业化的重要性。

Abstract: Traffic safety analysis requires complex video understanding to capture
fine-grained behavioral patterns and generate comprehensive descriptions for
accident prevention. In this work, we present a unique dual-model framework
that strategically utilizes the complementary strengths of VideoLLaMA and
Qwen2.5-VL through task-specific optimization to address this issue. The core
insight behind our approach is that separating training for captioning and
visual question answering (VQA) tasks minimizes task interference and allows
each model to specialize more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate
that VideoLLaMA is particularly effective in temporal reasoning, achieving a
CIDEr score of 1.1001, while Qwen2.5-VL excels in visual understanding with a
VQA accuracy of 60.80\%. Through extensive experiments on the WTS dataset, our
method achieves an S2 score of 45.7572 in the 2025 AI City Challenge Track 2,
placing 10th on the challenge leaderboard. Ablation studies validate that our
separate training strategy outperforms joint training by 8.6\% in VQA accuracy
while maintaining captioning quality.

*Hatem Ibrahem,Ahmed Salem,Qinmin Vivian Hu,Guanghui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PanoTPS-Net模型，通过CNN和TPS空间变换从单张全景图像估计3D房间布局，能有效处理立方体和非立方体布局。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计房间3D布局在计算机视觉中至关重要，可应用于机器人、增强现实和室内设计等领域。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：首先用CNN提取图像特征并学习TPS变换参数，然后用TPS空间变换层将参考布局变形为目标布局。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上表现优异，3DIoU值分别达到85.49、86.16、81.76和91.98，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 模型在房间布局估计中准确且鲁棒，证明了TPS变换与全景图像的兼容性，能有效处理各种布局类型。

Abstract: Accurately estimating the 3D layout of rooms is a crucial task in computer
vision, with potential applications in robotics, augmented reality, and
interior design. This paper proposes a novel model, PanoTPS-Net, to estimate
room layout from a single panorama image. Leveraging a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) and incorporating a Thin Plate Spline (TPS) spatial
transformation, the architecture of PanoTPS-Net is divided into two stages:
First, a convolutional neural network extracts the high-level features from the
input images, allowing the network to learn the spatial parameters of the TPS
transformation. Second, the TPS spatial transformation layer is generated to
warp a reference layout to the required layout based on the predicted
parameters. This unique combination empowers the model to properly predict room
layouts while also generalizing effectively to both cuboid and non-cuboid
layouts. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets and comparisons
with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method. The results underscore the model's accuracy in room layout estimation
and emphasize the compatibility between the TPS transformation and panorama
images. The robustness of the model in handling both cuboid and non-cuboid room
layout estimation is evident with a 3DIoU value of 85.49, 86.16, 81.76, and
91.98 on PanoContext, Stanford-2D3D, Matterport3DLayout, and ZInD datasets,
respectively. The source code is available at:

*Tanner Muturi,Blessing Agyei Kyem,Joshua Kofi Asamoah,Neema Jakisa Owor,Richard Dyzinela,Andrews Danyo,Yaw Adu-Gyamfi,Armstrong Aboah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个专门的空间推理框架，通过将边界框坐标嵌入输入提示中来增强空间理解，在AI City Challenge Track 3中排名第4。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模3D环境中的空间推理存在挑战，现有模型依赖局部外观而缺乏明确的空间基础，难以在仓库等场景中泛化。

Method: 将掩码维度以边界框坐标形式嵌入输入提示，使模型能够推理对象几何和布局；针对四个问题类别进行微调；在训练集中向GPT响应添加规范化答案。

Result: 最终得分为73.0606，在公共排行榜上排名第4。

Conclusion: 结构化提示丰富和针对性优化在推进现实工业环境空间推理方面具有有效性。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large-scale 3D environments such as warehouses remains a
significant challenge for vision-language systems due to scene clutter,
occlusions, and the need for precise spatial understanding. Existing models
often struggle with generalization in such settings, as they rely heavily on
local appearance and lack explicit spatial grounding. In this work, we
introduce a dedicated spatial reasoning framework for the Physical AI Spatial
Intelligence Warehouse dataset introduced in the Track 3 2025 AI City
Challenge. Our approach enhances spatial comprehension by embedding mask
dimensions in the form of bounding box coordinates directly into the input
prompts, enabling the model to reason over object geometry and layout. We
fine-tune the framework across four question categories namely: Distance
Estimation, Object Counting, Multi-choice Grounding, and Spatial Relation
Inference using task-specific supervision. To further improve consistency with
the evaluation system, normalized answers are appended to the GPT response
within the training set. Our comprehensive pipeline achieves a final score of
73.0606, placing 4th overall on the public leaderboard. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of structured prompt enrichment and targeted
optimization in advancing spatial reasoning for real-world industrial
environments.

### [7] [Evaluating the Explainability of Vision Transformers in Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12021)
*Leili Barekatain,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 评估不同Vision Transformer架构和预训练策略在医学影像中的可解释性，发现DINO结合Grad-CAM能提供最忠实和局部化的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学影像中，模型决策的可解释性直接影响临床信任和采用。Vision Transformers在诊断影像中表现出色，但其复杂的注意力机制对可解释性构成挑战。

Method: 使用Gradient Attention Rollout和Grad-CAM评估ViT、DeiT、DINO和Swin Transformer等不同Vision Transformer架构和预训练策略，在血细胞分类和乳腺超声图像分类任务上进行定量和定性分析。

Result: DINO结合Grad-CAM在所有数据集中提供最忠实和局部化的解释。Grad-CAM产生类别区分性和空间精确的热图，而Gradient Attention Rollout产生更分散的激活。即使在误分类情况下，DINO与Grad-CAM也能突出显示误导模型的临床相关形态特征。

Conclusion: 通过提高模型透明度，这项研究支持将Vision Transformers可靠且可解释地集成到关键医学诊断工作流程中。

Abstract: Understanding model decisions is crucial in medical imaging, where
interpretability directly impacts clinical trust and adoption. Vision
Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in
diagnostic imaging; however, their complex attention mechanisms pose challenges
to explainability. This study evaluates the explainability of different Vision
Transformer architectures and pre-training strategies - ViT, DeiT, DINO, and
Swin Transformer - using Gradient Attention Rollout and Grad-CAM. We conduct
both quantitative and qualitative analyses on two medical imaging tasks:
peripheral blood cell classification and breast ultrasound image
classification. Our findings indicate that DINO combined with Grad-CAM offers
the most faithful and localized explanations across datasets. Grad-CAM
consistently produces class-discriminative and spatially precise heatmaps,
while Gradient Attention Rollout yields more scattered activations. Even in
misclassification cases, DINO with Grad-CAM highlights clinically relevant
morphological features that appear to have misled the model. By improving model
transparency, this research supports the reliable and explainable integration
of ViTs into critical medical diagnostic workflows.

### [8] [APGNet: Adaptive Prior-Guided for Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12056)
*Xinxin Huang,Han Sun,Junmin Cai,Ningzhong Liu,Huiyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出APGNet网络用于水下伪装目标检测，通过自适应先验引导机制解决水下图像退化和海洋生物伪装问题，在公开数据集上优于15种先进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决水下环境中图像退化（低对比度、颜色失真）和海洋生物自然伪装带来的检测挑战，现有方法难以适应水下光学特性。

Method: 采用孪生网络架构，结合MSRCR算法进行数据增强，设计扩展感受野模块和多尺度渐进解码器，提出自适应先验引导机制分层融合位置和边界先验。

Result: 在两个公开MAS数据集上的实验表明，APGNet在广泛使用的评估指标上优于15种最先进方法。

Conclusion: APGNet通过自适应先验引导机制有效提升了水下伪装目标检测的鲁棒性和准确性，为海洋生态研究和资源勘探提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting camouflaged objects in underwater environments is crucial for
marine ecological research and resource exploration. However, existing methods
face two key challenges: underwater image degradation, including low contrast
and color distortion, and the natural camouflage of marine organisms.
Traditional image enhancement techniques struggle to restore critical features
in degraded images, while camouflaged object detection (COD) methods developed
for terrestrial scenes often fail to adapt to underwater environments due to
the lack of consideration for underwater optical characteristics.
  To address these issues, we propose APGNet, an Adaptive Prior-Guided Network,
which integrates a Siamese architecture with a novel prior-guided mechanism to
enhance robustness and detection accuracy. First, we employ the Multi-Scale
Retinex with Color Restoration (MSRCR) algorithm for data augmentation,
generating illumination-invariant images to mitigate degradation effects.
Second, we design an Extended Receptive Field (ERF) module combined with a
Multi-Scale Progressive Decoder (MPD) to capture multi-scale contextual
information and refine feature representations. Furthermore, we propose an
adaptive prior-guided mechanism that hierarchically fuses position and boundary
priors by embedding spatial attention in high-level features for coarse
localization and using deformable convolution to refine contours in low-level
features.
  Extensive experimental results on two public MAS datasets demonstrate that
our proposed method APGNet outperforms 15 state-of-art methods under widely
used evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VidMP3是一个基于扩散模型的视频编辑方法，通过利用姿态和位置先验学习源视频的通用运动表示，能够在保持原始运动的同时实现结构和语义的灵活编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法在结构可变编辑中存在时间不一致、主体身份漂移和需要人工干预等问题，需要一种能够同时保持运动并允许结构和语义灵活性的解决方案。

Method: 利用姿态和位置先验从源视频中学习通用运动表示，基于扩散模型框架实现运动保持的视频编辑。

Result: 定性和定量评估表明该方法优于现有方法，能够生成保持原始运动的新视频，同时允许结构和语义的灵活性。

Conclusion: VidMP3通过运动表示学习有效解决了视频编辑中的时间一致性和结构灵活性问题，为创作者提供了更好的编辑工具。

Abstract: Motion-preserved video editing is crucial for creators, particularly in
scenarios that demand flexibility in both the structure and semantics of
swapped objects. Despite its potential, this area remains underexplored.
Existing diffusion-based editing methods excel in structure-preserving tasks,
using dense guidance signals to ensure content integrity. While some recent
methods attempt to address structure-variable editing, they often suffer from
issues such as temporal inconsistency, subject identity drift, and the need for
human intervention. To address these challenges, we introduce VidMP3, a novel
approach that leverages pose and position priors to learn a generalized motion
representation from source videos. Our method enables the generation of new
videos that maintain the original motion while allowing for structural and
semantic flexibility. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate
the superiority of our approach over existing methods. The code will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/sandeep-sm/VidMP3.

Abstract: The major challenge in today's computer vision scenario is the availability
of good quality labeled data. In a field of study like image classification,
where data is of utmost importance, we need to find more reliable methods which
can overcome the scarcity of data to produce results comparable to previous
benchmark results. In most cases, obtaining labeled data is very difficult
because of the high cost of human labor and in some cases impossible. The
purpose of this paper is to discuss Domain Adaptation and various methods to
implement it. The main idea is to use a model trained on a particular dataset
to predict on data from a different domain of the same kind, for example - a
model trained on paintings of airplanes predicting on real images of airplanes

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved audio-driven
human video generation, surpassing traditional methods in both quality and
controllability. However, existing approaches still face challenges in lip-sync
accuracy, temporal coherence for long video generation, and multi-character
animation. In this work, we propose a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based
framework for generating lifelike talking videos of arbitrary length, and
introduce a training-free method for multi-character audio-driven animation.
First, we employ a LoRA-based training strategy combined with a position shift
inference approach, which enables efficient long video generation while
preserving the capabilities of the foundation model. Moreover, we combine
partial parameter updates with reward feedback to enhance both lip
synchronization and natural body motion. Finally, we propose a training-free
approach, Mask Classifier-Free Guidance (Mask-CFG), for multi-character
animation, which requires no specialized datasets or model modifications and
supports audio-driven animation for three or more characters. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving high-quality, temporally coherent, and multi-character
audio-driven video generation in a simple, efficient, and cost-effective
manner.

### [13] [An Adaptive Edge-Guided Dual-Network Framework for Fast QR Code Motion Deblurring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12098)
*Jianping Li,Dongyang Guo,Wenjie Li,Wei Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对QR码去模糊的自适应双网络方法，包括用于严重模糊的EG-Restormer和用于轻度模糊的LENet，显著提升了QR码的解码成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法很少显式利用QR码高度结构化的边缘先验，而QR码去模糊的关键在于确保成功解码而非感知质量。

Method: 设计了边缘引导注意力块(EGAB)将显式边缘先验嵌入Transformer架构，基于此构建EG-Restormer处理严重模糊，同时开发轻量级LENet处理轻度模糊，最终集成到自适应双网络(ADNet)中。

Result: 实验表明EG-Restormer和ADNet在解码率和速度方面均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式利用QR码的结构化边缘先验，有效提升了去模糊性能，特别适合资源受限的移动设备应用。

Abstract: Unlike general image deblurring that prioritizes perceptual quality, QR code
deblurring focuses on ensuring successful decoding. QR codes are characterized
by highly structured patterns with sharp edges, a robust prior for restoration.
Yet existing deep learning methods rarely exploit these priors explicitly. To
address this gap, we propose the Edge-Guided Attention Block (EGAB), which
embeds explicit edge priors into a Transformer architecture. Based on EGAB, we
develop Edge-Guided Restormer (EG-Restormer), an effective network that
significantly boosts the decoding rate of severely blurred QR codes. For mildly
blurred inputs, we design the Lightweight and Efficient Network (LENet) for
fast deblurring. We further integrate these two networks into an Adaptive
Dual-network (ADNet), which dynamically selects the suitable network based on
input blur severity, making it ideal for resource-constrained mobile devices.
Extensive experiments show that our EG-Restormer and ADNet achieve
state-of-the-art performance with a competitive speed. Project page:

Motivation: 现有基于预训练扩散模型的3D场景重建方法存在两个关键问题：缺乏可靠几何监督导致重建质量差，以及多视角不一致性导致形状-外观模糊和几何退化。

Method: 利用平面结构生成精确度量尺度深度图，在观察和未观察区域提供可靠监督；将几何引导融入生成流程，改进可见性掩码估计、指导新视角选择，并通过视频扩散模型增强多视角一致性修复。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in leveraging generative prior from pre-trained
diffusion models for 3D scene reconstruction, existing methods still face two
critical limitations. First, due to the lack of reliable geometric supervision,
they struggle to produce high-quality reconstructions even in observed regions,
let alone in unobserved areas. Second, they lack effective mechanisms to
mitigate multi-view inconsistencies in the generated images, leading to severe
shape-appearance ambiguities and degraded scene geometry. In this paper, we
identify accurate geometry as the fundamental prerequisite for effectively
exploiting generative models to enhance 3D scene reconstruction. We first
propose to leverage the prevalence of planar structures to derive accurate
metric-scale depth maps, providing reliable supervision in both observed and
unobserved regions. Furthermore, we incorporate this geometry guidance
throughout the generative pipeline to improve visibility mask estimation, guide
novel view selection, and enhance multi-view consistency when inpainting with
video diffusion models, resulting in accurate and consistent scene completion.
Extensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet++, and DeepBlending show that our
method consistently outperforms existing baselines in both geometry and
appearance reconstruction, particularly for unobserved regions. Moreover, our
method naturally supports single-view inputs and unposed videos, with strong
generalizability in both indoor and outdoor scenarios with practical real-world

*Jiawei Zhan,Jun Liu,Jinlong Peng,Xiaochen Chen,Bin-Bin Gao,Yong Liu,Chengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DRL框架解决非排练类增量学习中的三大挑战：模型复杂度增长、表示空间不连续变化、局部优化与全局推理不一致。通过轻量级适配器和解耦锚点监督实现高效增量学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练模型在非排练类增量学习中表现优异，但仍面临模型复杂度增长、表示空间不连续变化、局部优化与全局推理不一致三大挑战。

Method: 提出增量并行适配器网络，在预训练模型基础上学习轻量级适配器，通过传输门实现表示能力继承；设计解耦锚点监督，分别约束正负样本与虚拟锚点的距离。

Result: 在六个基准测试上的实验表明，DRL在整个CIL过程中持续优于其他最先进方法，同时在训练和推理阶段保持高效率。

Conclusion: DRL框架有效解决了类增量学习中的关键挑战，通过轻量级适配器和解耦监督机制实现了高效且稳定的增量学习性能。

Abstract: With the excellent representation capabilities of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs),
remarkable progress has been made in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning
(CIL) research. However, it remains an extremely challenging task due to three
conundrums: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation
shift during incremental learning and inconsistency between stage-wise
sub-problem optimization and global inference. In this work, we propose the
Discriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address
these challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet
efficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA)
network, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a
lightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each
incremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new
classes, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the
current model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a
result, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different
incremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable
comparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the
Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and
negative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This
decoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the
feature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between
stage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across
all classes. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks reveal that our DRL
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire
CIL period while maintaining high efficiency in both training and inference
phases.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SSDiff方法，利用预训练扩散模型生成伪参考人脸，通过分阶段监督实现老照片人脸修复，在结构对齐和颜色自然性方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖显式退化先验或全局统计指导，难以处理局部伪影和面部颜色问题，需要更有效的修复方法。

Method: 使用预训练扩散模型在弱指导下生成伪参考人脸，通过分阶段监督（结构引导和颜色细化）和选择性修复（结合人脸解析图和划痕掩码）实现区域特定修复。

Result: 在构建的VintageFace基准测试中，SSDiff在感知质量、保真度和区域可控性方面优于现有GAN和扩散方法。

Conclusion: SSDiff通过伪参考生成和选择性引导机制，有效解决了老照片人脸修复中的复合退化问题，具有更好的修复效果。

Abstract: Old-photo face restoration poses significant challenges due to compounded
degradations such as breakage, fading, and severe blur. Existing pre-trained
diffusion-guided methods either rely on explicit degradation priors or global
statistical guidance, which struggle with localized artifacts or face color. We
propose Self-Supervised Selective-Guided Diffusion (SSDiff), which leverages
pseudo-reference faces generated by a pre-trained diffusion model under weak
guidance. These pseudo-labels exhibit structurally aligned contours and natural
colors, enabling region-specific restoration via staged supervision: structural
guidance applied throughout the denoising process and color refinement in later
steps, aligned with the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion. By incorporating
face parsing maps and scratch masks, our method selectively restores breakage
regions while avoiding identity mismatch. We further construct VintageFace, a
300-image benchmark of real old face photos with varying degradation levels.
SSDiff outperforms existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods in perceptual
quality, fidelity, and regional controllability. Code link:

TL;DR: 提出了ImageSentinel框架，通过合成哨兵图像来保护视觉数据集在检索增强图像生成系统中的未授权使用，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决检索增强图像生成系统中私有图像数据集未授权使用的问题，传统数字水印方法在复杂特征提取和重组过程中无法保持水印信号。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型合成与原始数据集视觉一致的哨兵图像，通过随机生成的字符序列作为检索密钥进行保护验证。

Result: 实验结果表明ImageSentinel能有效检测未授权的数据集使用，同时为授权应用保持生成质量。

Conclusion: ImageSentinel为保护视觉数据集在RAIG系统中的未授权使用提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Image Generation (RAIG) has
raised significant concerns about the unauthorized use of private image
datasets. While these systems have shown remarkable capabilities in enhancing
generation quality through reference images, protecting visual datasets from
unauthorized use in such systems remains a challenging problem. Traditional
digital watermarking approaches face limitations in RAIG systems, as the
complex feature extraction and recombination processes fail to preserve
watermark signals during generation. To address these challenges, we propose
ImageSentinel, a novel framework for protecting visual datasets in RAIG. Our
framework synthesizes sentinel images that maintain visual consistency with the
original dataset. These sentinels enable protection verification through
randomly generated character sequences that serve as retrieval keys. To ensure
seamless integration, we leverage vision-language models to generate the
sentinel images. Experimental results demonstrate that ImageSentinel
effectively detects unauthorized dataset usage while preserving generation
quality for authorized applications. Code is available at

*David Parra,Felipe Gutierrez-Barragan,Trevor Seets,Andreas Velten*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于约束优化的编码函数设计方法，用于压缩单光子3D成像，在硬件限制下优于传统编码设计


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单光子相机在飞行时间3D成像中性能受限于系统带宽、激光功率、传感器数据速率等硬件约束，现有压缩直方图方法在真实世界照明硬件约束下表现不佳

Method: 使用梯度下降联合优化照明和编码矩阵（编码函数），确保符合硬件约束条件

Result: 通过广泛模拟验证，该方法在带宽和峰值功率约束下始终优于传统编码设计，特别是在峰值功率受限系统中优势更明显

Conclusion: 该方法能够适应任意参数化脉冲响应，在真实世界非理想脉冲响应系统中表现良好

Abstract: Single-photon cameras are becoming increasingly popular in time-of-flight 3D
imaging because they can time-tag individual photons with extreme resolution.
However, their performance is susceptible to hardware limitations, such as
system bandwidth, maximum laser power, sensor data rates, and in-sensor memory
and compute resources. Compressive histograms were recently introduced as a
solution to the challenge of data rates through an online in-sensor compression
of photon timestamp data. Although compressive histograms work within limited
in-sensor memory and computational resources, they underperform when subjected
to real-world illumination hardware constraints. To address this, we present a
constrained optimization approach for designing practical coding functions for
compressive single-photon 3D imaging. Using gradient descent, we jointly
optimize an illumination and coding matrix (i.e., the coding functions) that
adheres to hardware constraints. We show through extensive simulations that our
coding functions consistently outperform traditional coding designs under both
bandwidth and peak power constraints. This advantage is particularly pronounced
in systems constrained by peak power. Finally, we show that our approach adapts
to arbitrary parameterized impulse responses by evaluating it on a real-world
system with a non-ideal impulse response function.

Motivation: 当前开源模型在通用视觉描述任务上与商业模型存在较大性能差距，限制了数据合成等应用。需要开发能够桥接这一差距的解决方案。

Method: 提出CapFlow多智能体协作工作流，利用开源模型作为数据合成器，大规模生成高质量图像和视频描述，然后通过微调获得MetaCaptioner通用视觉描述器。

Result: CapFlow在多个视觉领域实现与GPT-4相当的描述质量，成本降低89.5%。MetaCaptioner不仅具备与商业模型相当的描述能力，在开源社区达到顶尖多模态性能。

Conclusion: CapFlow和MetaCaptioner为未来多模态研究提供了强大且经济高效的视觉描述解决方案。

Abstract: Generalist visual captioning goes beyond a simple appearance description
task, but requires integrating a series of visual cues into a caption and
handling various visual domains. In this task, current open-source models
present a large performance gap with commercial ones, which limits various
applications such as data synthesis. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes
CapFlow, a novel multi-agent collaboration workflow. CapFlow demonstrates for
the first time that, by capitalizing on open-source models, it is possible to
achieve caption quality on par with GPT-4.1 in various domains with an 89.5%
reduction in costs. By leveraging CapFlow as the data synthesizer, we produce
high-quality visual captions from image and video domains at scale, and obtain
a generalist visual captioner via fine-tuning, namely MetaCaptioner. Through
extensive experiments, we show that MetaCaptioner not only achieves comparable
captioning capabilities with commercial models but also reaches top-tier
multimodal performance in the open-source community. We hope CapFlow and
MetaCaptioner can benefit future multimodal research by providing a strong and
cost-effective visual captioning solution.

Motivation: 远程生理测量需要收集用户隐私敏感信息，现有非接触式测量依赖标注数据，而现实部署中大量用户数据缺乏标签，难以更新模型。

Method: FedHUG框架包含：最小偏差聚合模块动态调整聚合权重处理异构非IID特征；全局分布感知学习控制器参数化标签分布并动态调整客户端训练策略。

Result: 在RGB视频和毫米波雷达生理测量中，该方法在无监督域泛化任务上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: FedHUG框架有效解决了联邦学习中无监督域泛化的挑战，代码将开源。

Abstract: Remote physiological measurement gained wide attention, while it requires
collecting users' privacy-sensitive information, and existing contactless
measurements still rely on labeled client data. This presents challenges when
we want to further update real-world deployed models with numerous user data
lacking labels. To resolve these challenges, we instantiate a new protocol
called Federated Unsupervised Domain Generalization (FUDG) in this work.
Subsequently, the \textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{H}eterogeneous
\textbf{U}nsupervised \textbf{G}eneralization (\textbf{FedHUG}) framework is
proposed and consists of: (1) Minimal Bias Aggregation module dynamically
adjusts aggregation weights based on prior-driven bias evaluation to cope with
heterogeneous non-IID features from multiple domains. (2) The Global
Distribution-aware Learning Controller parameterizes the label distribution and
dynamically manipulates client-specific training strategies, thereby mitigating
the server-client label distribution skew and long-tail issue. The proposal
shows superior performance across state-of-the-art techniques in estimation
with either RGB video or mmWave radar. The code will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出KFF方法，通过类感知域知识融合与分裂解决持续测试时适应中的灾难性遗忘问题，动态积累判别性历史知识


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTTA方法通过恢复初始模型或重用历史模型来减少灾难性遗忘，但会导致新知识学习不足和有害历史知识干扰，造成性能下降

Method: 设计域知识分裂模块自适应分离新域知识，减轻旧域负知识影响；设计域知识融合模块以最小成本合并新知识，采用贪心知识动态合并策略提高新旧知识兼容性

Result: 在ImageNet-C数据集上的广泛实验验证了该方法相对于其他方法的有效性

Conclusion: KFF方法通过知识融合与分裂机制，在持续测试时适应中实现了更好的性能表现

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to quickly fine-tune the model
during the test phase so that it can adapt to multiple unknown downstream
domain distributions without pre-acquiring downstream domain data. To this end,
existing advanced CTTA methods mainly reduce the catastrophic forgetting of
historical knowledge caused by irregular switching of downstream domain data by
restoring the initial model or reusing historical models. However, these
methods are usually accompanied by serious insufficient learning of new
knowledge and interference from potentially harmful historical knowledge,
resulting in severe performance degradation. To this end, we propose a
class-aware domain Knowledge Fusion and Fission method for continual test-time
adaptation, called KFF, which adaptively expands and merges class-aware domain
knowledge in old and new domains according to the test-time data from different
domains, where discriminative historical knowledge can be dynamically
accumulated. Specifically, considering the huge domain gap within streaming
data, a domain Knowledge FIssion (KFI) module is designed to adaptively
separate new domain knowledge from a paired class-aware domain prompt pool,
alleviating the impact of negative knowledge brought by old domains that are
distinct from the current domain. Besides, to avoid the cumulative computation
and storage overheads from continuously fissioning new knowledge, a domain
Knowledge FUsion (KFU) module is further designed to merge the fissioned new
knowledge into the existing knowledge pool with minimal cost, where a greedy
knowledge dynamic merging strategy is designed to improve the compatibility of
new and old knowledge while keeping the computational efficiency. Extensive
experiments on the ImageNet-C dataset verify the effectiveness of our proposed
method against other methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于原型的单次学习方法使用确定性平均特征，无法捕捉类内多样性，导致在医学图像中面对显著解剖变异时泛化能力不足

Method: 提出扩散原型学习框架：1）扩散原型增强模块通过前向-反向扩散过程生成多样化原型变体；2）空间感知条件机制利用原型特征统计的几何属性；3）保守融合策略在保持原型保真度同时最大化表示多样性

Result: 在腹部MRI和CT数据集上的广泛实验显示显著改进，建立了单次医学图像分割的最新性能

Conclusion: DPL通过将原型建模为概率分布并利用扩散过程生成多样化变体，有效解决了单次医学图像分割中的原型表示挑战，实现了更好的泛化性能

Abstract: One-shot medical image segmentation faces fundamental challenges in prototype
representation due to limited annotated data and significant anatomical
variability across patients. Traditional prototype-based methods rely on
deterministic averaging of support features, creating brittle representations
that fail to capture intra-class diversity essential for robust generalization.
This work introduces Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL), a novel framework that
reformulates prototype construction through diffusion-based feature space
exploration. DPL models one-shot prototypes as learnable probability
distributions, enabling controlled generation of diverse yet semantically
coherent prototype variants from minimal labeled data. The framework operates
through three core innovations: (1) a diffusion-based prototype enhancement
module that transforms single support prototypes into diverse variant sets via
forward-reverse diffusion processes, (2) a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism
that leverages geometric properties derived from prototype feature statistics,
and (3) a conservative fusion strategy that preserves prototype fidelity while
maximizing representational diversity. DPL ensures training-inference
consistency by using the same diffusion enhancement and fusion pipeline in both
phases. This process generates enhanced prototypes that serve as the final
representations for similarity calculations, while the diffusion process itself
acts as a regularizer. Extensive experiments on abdominal MRI and CT datasets
demonstrate significant improvements respectively, establishing new
state-of-the-art performance in one-shot medical image segmentation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于视频理解的状态空间提示（SSP）方法，通过帧内聚集和帧间传播模块来聚合和传播视频中的关键时空信息，显著提升了视频分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预训练状态空间模型在视频分类中虽然效率高，但顺序压缩的视觉提示令牌无法有效捕捉视频的空间和时间上下文信息，限制了空间信息在帧内和时间信息在帧间的有效传播。

Method: 设计了帧内聚集（IFG）模块来聚合每帧内的空间关键信息，以及帧间传播（IFS）模块来在不同帧间传播判别性时空信息，通过自适应平衡和压缩帧内和帧间的关键时空信息来互补传播判别性信息。

Result: 在四个视频基准数据集上的广泛实验验证了SSP方法显著优于现有的SOTA方法，平均提升2.76%，同时减少了微调参数的开销。

Conclusion: SSP方法通过有效聚合和传播视频中的关键时空信息，在保持高效处理的同时显著提升了视频理解的性能。

Abstract: Recently, pre-trained state space models have shown great potential for video
classification, which sequentially compresses visual tokens in videos with
linear complexity, thereby improving the processing efficiency of video data
while maintaining high performance. To apply powerful pre-trained models to
downstream tasks, prompt learning is proposed to achieve efficient downstream
task adaptation with only a small number of fine-tuned parameters. However, the
sequentially compressed visual prompt tokens fail to capture the spatial and
temporal contextual information in the video, thus limiting the effective
propagation of spatial information within a video frame and temporal
information between frames in the state compression model and the extraction of
discriminative information. To tackle the above issue, we proposed a State
Space Prompting (SSP) method for video understanding, which combines
intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to aggregate and propagate key
spatiotemporal information in the video. Specifically, an Intra-Frame Gathering
(IFG) module is designed to aggregate spatial key information within each
frame. Besides, an Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) module is designed to spread
discriminative spatio-temporal information across different frames. By
adaptively balancing and compressing key spatio-temporal information within and
between frames, our SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in
videos in a complementary manner. Extensive experiments on four video benchmark
datasets verify that our SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by
2.76% on average while reducing the overhead of fine-tuning parameters.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniGS, a unified map representation and
differentiable framework for high-fidelity multimodal 3D reconstruction based
on 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our framework integrates a CUDA-accelerated
rasterization pipeline capable of rendering photo-realistic RGB images,
geometrically accurate depth maps, consistent surface normals, and semantic
logits simultaneously. We redesign the rasterization to render depth via
differentiable ray-ellipsoid intersection rather than using Gaussian centers,
enabling effective optimization of rotation and scale attribute through
analytic depth gradients. Furthermore, we derive the analytic gradient
formulation for surface normal rendering, ensuring geometric consistency among
reconstructed 3D scenes. To improve computational and storage efficiency, we
introduce a learnable attribute that enables differentiable pruning of
Gaussians with minimal contribution during training. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy
across all modalities, validating the efficacy of our geometry-aware paradigm.

TL;DR: BEEP3D提出了一种端到端的3D实例分割方法，使用边界框标注作为弱监督信号，通过师生框架生成伪掩码，避免了传统两阶段方法的复杂性和训练时间问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 完全监督的3D实例分割需要密集的点级标注，成本高昂。边界框标注虽然更易获取，但在重叠区域存在模糊性。现有方法采用两阶段训练生成伪掩码，但增加了训练复杂性和时间。

Method: 采用师生框架，教师模型作为伪标签生成器，通过指数移动平均更新。引入基于实例中心的查询精炼来增强位置查询定位，并设计查询一致性损失和掩码特征一致性损失来对齐预测与伪掩码的语义和几何信号。

Result: 在ScanNetV2和S3DIS数据集上的实验表明，BEEP3D在计算效率高的同时，达到了与最先进弱监督方法相当或更优的性能。

Conclusion: BEEP3D提供了一种高效的端到端解决方案，能够在减少标注成本的同时实现高质量的3D实例分割。

Abstract: 3D instance segmentation is crucial for understanding complex 3D
environments, yet fully supervised methods require dense point-level
annotations, resulting in substantial annotation costs and labor overhead. To
mitigate this, box-level annotations have been explored as a weaker but more
scalable form of supervision. However, box annotations inherently introduce
ambiguity in overlapping regions, making accurate point-to-instance assignment
challenging. Recent methods address this ambiguity by generating pseudo-masks
through training a dedicated pseudo-labeler in an additional training stage.
However, such two-stage pipelines often increase overall training time and
complexity, hinder end-to-end optimization. To overcome these challenges, we
propose BEEP3D-Box-supervised End-to-End Pseudo-mask generation for 3D instance
segmentation. BEEP3D adopts a student-teacher framework, where the teacher
model serves as a pseudo-labeler and is updated by the student model via an
Exponential Moving Average. To better guide the teacher model to generate
precise pseudo-masks, we introduce an instance center-based query refinement
that enhances position query localization and leverages features near instance
centers. Additionally, we design two novel losses-query consistency loss and
masked feature consistency loss-to align semantic and geometric signals between
predictions and pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS
datasets demonstrate that BEEP3D achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods while remaining
computationally efficient.

Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法难以有效传递教师MLLM的丰富视觉感知能力到学生模型，主要原因是学生与教师之间的视觉注意力错位问题。

Method: 提出CompoDistill框架，通过显式对齐学生模型与教师模型的视觉注意力来增强学生模型的视觉感知能力。

Result: 实验表明CompoDistill在需要视觉感知能力的组合推理任务上显著提升性能，同时在视觉问答任务上保持强劲表现，且在不同骨干网络上具有良好泛化性。

Conclusion: CompoDistill通过解决视觉注意力错位问题，有效提升了学生模型的视觉感知能力，为高效MLLM的知识蒸馏提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recently, efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained
significant attention as a solution to their high computational complexity,
making them more practical for real-world applications. In this regard, the
knowledge distillation (KD) approach has emerged as a promising alternative,
which transfers the rich visual and linguistic knowledge from a larger model
(teacher) to a smaller model (student). However, we observe that existing KD
methods struggle to effectively distill the teacher MLLM's rich visual
perception abilities to the student, a challenge that has been largely
overlooked in previous studies. Through a systematic analysis, we identify
visual attention misalignment between student and teacher as the main cause of
this issue. Based on this insight, we propose CompoDistill, a novel KD
framework that explicitly aligns the student's visual attention with that of
the teacher to enhance the student's visual perception abilities. Our extensive
experiments show that CompoDistill significantly improves performance on
compositional reasoning tasks that require visual perception abilities while
maintaining strong performance on visual question answering tasks, as done in
existing studies. Furthermore, CompoDistill demonstrates effectiveness with a
more advanced backbone, highlighting its generalizability.

Conclusion: 基于视觉语言模型的分层推理是事故分析和安全关键交通事件理解的有前景方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving have been enabled by
training on diverse large-scale driving datasets, yet autonomous driving models
still struggle in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. The COOOL benchmark
targets this gap by encouraging hazard understanding beyond closed taxonomies,
and the 2COOOL challenge extends it to generating human-interpretable incident
reports. We present a hierarchical reasoning framework for incident report
generation from dashcam videos that integrates frame-level captioning, incident
frame detection, and fine-grained reasoning within vision-language models
(VLMs). We further improve factual accuracy and readability through model
ensembling and a Blind A/B Scoring selection protocol. On the official 2COOOL
open leaderboard, our method ranks 2nd among 29 teams and achieves the best
CIDEr-D score, producing accurate and coherent incident narratives. These
results indicate that hierarchical reasoning with VLMs is a promising direction
for accident analysis and for broader understanding of safety-critical traffic
events. The implementation and code are available at

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI, particularly in computer vision (CV), offer
new opportunities to optimize workflows across industries, including logistics
and manufacturing. However, many AI applications are limited by a lack of
expertise and resources, which forces a reliance on general-purpose models.
Success with these models often requires domain-specific data for fine-tuning,
which can be costly and inefficient. Thus, using synthetic data for fine-tuning
is a popular, cost-effective alternative to gathering real-world data. This
work investigates the impact of synthetic data on the performance of object
detection models, compared to models trained on real-world data only,
specifically within the domain of warehouse logistics. To this end, we examined
the impact of synthetic data generated using the NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator
tool on the effectiveness of object detection models in real-world scenarios.
It comprises experiments focused on pallet detection in a warehouse setting,
utilizing both real and various synthetic dataset generation strategies. Our
findings provide valuable insights into the practical applications of synthetic
image data in computer vision, suggesting that a balanced integration of
synthetic and real data can lead to robust and efficient object detection
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DIANet双流框架，通过分别编码微表情的起始到顶点和顶点到结束两个阶段，使用交叉注意力融合模块整合特征，在多个基准数据集上优于传统单阶段方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别面临面部线索细微短暂和标注数据有限的挑战。传统动态图像方法忽略了微表情不同时间阶段的独特特征，需要更精细的时间建模。

Method: 使用相位感知动态图像：一个流编码起始到顶点阶段，另一个流捕获顶点到结束阶段。每个流由专用CNN处理，通过交叉注意力融合模块自适应整合特征。

Result: 在CASME-II、SAMM和MMEW三个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法持续优于传统单相位动态图像方法。

Conclusion: 明确建模时间相位信息对微表情识别至关重要，为推进该领域提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that typically last
less than half a second and often reveal genuine emotions. Accurately
recognizing these subtle expressions is critical for applications in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis. However, micro-expression
recognition (MER) remains a challenging task due to the subtle and transient
nature of facial cues and the limited availability of annotated data. While
dynamic image (DI) representations have been introduced to summarize temporal
motion into a single frame, conventional DI-based methods often overlook the
distinct characteristics of different temporal phases within a
micro-expression. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel
dual-stream framework, DIANet, which leverages phase-aware dynamic images - one
encoding the onset-to-apex phase and the other capturing the apex-to-offset
phase. Each stream is processed by a dedicated convolutional neural network,
and a cross-attention fusion module is employed to adaptively integrate
features from both streams based on their contextual relevance. Extensive
experiments conducted on three benchmark MER datasets (CASME-II, SAMM, and
MMEW) demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms
conventional single-phase DI-based approaches. The results highlight the
importance of modeling temporal phase information explicitly and suggest a
promising direction for advancing MER.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在推理任务上表现出色，但构建高性能推理训练数据集的原则仍不清楚，需要系统研究数据整理策略对模型推理能力的影响。

Method: 通过控制训练和评估设置，分析上下文来源的影响，实施针对性数据干预（如图像描述辅助信号、纯文本推理），并探索图像、问题和思维链解决方案的规模化扩展。

Result: 研究发现上下文来源策略显著影响模型性能，数据干预带来实质性提升，多维度数据扩展持续改善推理能力。基于此构建的HoneyBee数据集（250万样本）训练出的模型在多个基准测试中超越现有最优模型。

Conclusion: 本研究为视觉语言推理数据集整理提供了改进策略，通过精心设计的数据集构建方法可显著提升模型推理能力，同时提出的测试时缩放策略能大幅降低解码成本。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have made them highly
effective at reasoning tasks. However, the principles underlying the
construction of performant VL reasoning training datasets remain poorly
understood. In this work, we introduce several data curation approaches and
study their impacts on VL reasoning capabilities by carefully controlling
training and evaluation setups. We analyze the effects of context (image and
question pair) sources, implement targeted data interventions, and explore
scaling up images, questions, and chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. Our
findings reveal that (a) context source strategies significantly affect VLM
performance, (b) interventions such as auxiliary signals from image captions
and the inclusion of text-only reasoning yield substantial gains, and (c)
scaling all data dimensions (e.g., unique questions per image and unique CoTs
per image-question pair) consistently improves reasoning capability. Motivated
by these insights, we introduce HoneyBee, a large-scale, high-quality CoT
reasoning dataset with 2.5M examples consisting 350K image-question pairs. VLMs
trained with HoneyBee outperform state-of-the-art models across model sizes.
For instance, a HoneyBee-trained VLM with 3B parameters outperforms the SOTA
model and the base model by 7.8% and 24.8%, respectively, on MathVerse.
Furthermore, we propose a test-time scaling strategy that reduces decoding cost
by 73% without sacrificing accuracy. Overall, this work presents improved
strategies for VL reasoning dataset curation research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决并行token预测中的结构不一致性问题，传统方法一旦采样token就无法回溯修正错误预测。

Method: 采用新颖的训练方案，在上下文中注入随机token以提高鲁棒性，并在采样过程中实现token修正。

Result: 在ImageNet-256、CIFAR-10图像生成和UCF-101、NuScenes视频生成任务中均取得显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持并行token预测效率优势的同时，显著提升了生成质量，适用于图像和视频生成两种模态。

Abstract: Recent advances in image and video generation have raised significant
interest from both academia and industry. A key challenge in this field is
improving inference efficiency, as model size and the number of inference steps
directly impact the commercial viability of generative models while also posing
fundamental scientific challenges. A promising direction involves combining
auto-regressive sequential token modeling with multi-token prediction per step,
reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude. However, predicting
multiple tokens in parallel can introduce structural inconsistencies due to
token incompatibilities, as capturing complex joint dependencies during
training remains challenging. Traditionally, once tokens are sampled, there is
no mechanism to backtrack and refine erroneous predictions. We propose a method
for self-correcting image generation by iteratively refining sampled tokens. We
achieve this with a novel training scheme that injects random tokens in the
context, improving robustness and enabling token fixing during sampling. Our
method preserves the efficiency benefits of parallel token prediction while
significantly enhancing generation quality. We evaluate our approach on image
generation using the ImageNet-256 and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as on video
generation with UCF-101 and NuScenes, demonstrating substantial improvements
across both modalities.

Motivation: 解决红外小目标检测中存在的跨域偏移和异方差噪声扰动双重挑战，传统方法在真实场景中面临分布偏差限制。

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 小波引导跨域合成生成目标域对齐的训练样本；2) 真实域噪声不变性学习，从目标域提取真实噪声特征构建动态噪声库，通过自监督损失学习噪声不变性。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在多个定量指标上优于现有最先进方法，特别是在跨域场景中表现出优异的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Ivan-ISTD框架有效解决了红外小目标检测中的跨域和噪声问题，创建了Dynamic-ISTD基准数据集验证方法有效性。

Abstract: In the multimedia domain, Infrared Small Target Detection (ISTD) plays a
important role in drone-based multi-modality sensing. To address the dual
challenges of cross-domain shift and heteroscedastic noise perturbations in
ISTD, we propose a doubly wavelet-guided Invariance learning
framework(Ivan-ISTD). In the first stage, we generate training samples aligned
with the target domain using Wavelet-guided Cross-domain Synthesis. This
wavelet-guided alignment machine accurately separates the target background
through multi-frequency wavelet filtering. In the second stage, we introduce
Real-domain Noise Invariance Learning, which extracts real noise
characteristics from the target domain to build a dynamic noise library. The
model learns noise invariance through self-supervised loss, thereby overcoming
the limitations of distribution bias in traditional artificial noise modeling.
Finally, we create the Dynamic-ISTD Benchmark, a cross-domain dynamic
degradation dataset that simulates the distribution shifts encountered in
real-world applications. Additionally, we validate the versatility of our
method using other real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of many
quantitative metrics. In particular, Ivan-ISTD demonstrates excellent
robustness in cross-domain scenarios. The code for this work can be found at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出使用时空一致的代理节点来表示视频中动态变化的对象/场景，克服传统像素级匹配和跟踪的不稳定性，支持多尺度结构表达和可控的外观编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频表示方法过度依赖不稳定且过于细粒度的运动和外观建模先验，如像素级匹配和跟踪，容易因跟踪误差、遮挡和大运动而崩溃。

Method: 使用分层代理节点稳定表达视觉对象的多尺度结构，通过动态表示更新机制利用视频的时空先验，并采用形状和纹理表示的分离编码方式。

Result: 实验表明，该方法以更少的参数实现了高视频重建精度，并支持复杂的视频处理任务，包括视频修复和基于关键帧的时间一致性视频编辑。

Conclusion: 提出的代理节点表示方法能够稳定处理视频中的动态变化，有效应对跟踪误差、长期运动、遮挡和视角变化，同时提供可控的细粒度外观编辑能力。

Abstract: Current video representations heavily rely on unstable and over-grained
priors for motion and appearance modelling, \emph{i.e.}, pixel-level matching
and tracking. A tracking error of just a few pixels would lead to the collapse
of the visual object representation, not to mention occlusions and large motion
frequently occurring in videos. To overcome the above mentioned vulnerability,
this work proposes spatio-temporally consistent proxy nodes to represent
dynamically changing objects/scenes in the video. On the one hand, the
hierarchical proxy nodes have the ability to stably express the multi-scale
structure of visual objects, so they are not affected by accumulated tracking
error, long-term motion, occlusion, and viewpoint variation. On the other hand,
the dynamic representation update mechanism of the proxy nodes adequately
leverages spatio-temporal priors of the video to mitigate the impact of
inaccurate trackers, thereby effectively handling drastic changes in scenes and
objects. Additionally, the decoupled encoding manner of the shape and texture
representations across different visual objects in the video facilitates
controllable and fine-grained appearance editing capability. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed representation achieves high video
reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters and supports complex video
processing tasks, including video in-painting and keyframe-based temporally
consistent video editing.

TL;DR: 提出了两种新的损失函数：乘法损失和置信度自适应乘法损失，用于医学和细胞图像的语义分割，在数据稀缺情况下表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像由于隐私、伦理和标注成本高而数据稀缺，现有的交叉熵和Dice损失的加法组合对超参数敏感且在有限数据下表现不佳，需要更鲁棒高效的训练目标。

Method: 乘法损失将交叉熵和Dice损失相乘，基于预测置信度动态调节梯度；置信度自适应乘法损失在此基础上应用置信度驱动的指数缩放，强调困难样本。

Result: 在细胞和医学分割基准测试中，该框架始终优于调优的加法损失和现有损失函数。

Conclusion: 该框架为在具有挑战性的数据限制下进行鲁棒分割提供了一种简单、有效且无需超参数的机制。

Abstract: We propose two novel loss functions, Multiplicative Loss and
Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss, for semantic segmentation in medical
and cellular images. Although Cross Entropy and Dice Loss are widely used,
their additive combination is sensitive to hyperparameters and often performs
suboptimally, especially with limited data. Medical images suffer from data
scarcity due to privacy, ethics, and costly annotations, requiring robust and
efficient training objectives. Our Multiplicative Loss combines Cross Entropy
and Dice losses multiplicatively, dynamically modulating gradients based on
prediction confidence. This reduces penalties for confident correct predictions
and amplifies gradients for incorrect overconfident ones, stabilizing
optimization. Building on this, Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss applies
a confidence-driven exponential scaling inspired by Focal Loss, integrating
predicted probabilities and Dice coefficients to emphasize difficult samples.
This enhances learning under extreme data scarcity by strengthening gradients
when confidence is low. Experiments on cellular and medical segmentation
benchmarks show our framework consistently outperforms tuned additive and
existing loss functions, offering a simple, effective, and hyperparameter-free
mechanism for robust segmentation under challenging data limitations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络在OOD数据上产生过度自信预测的问题，避免传统方法需要收集辅助OOD数据集或生成伪OOD图像的高成本限制。

Method: 利用ID图像中的局部背景特征作为模拟OOD视觉表示，基于卷积的局部不变性提取背景特征，通过优化降低这些特征的L2范数来训练模型。

Result: 在多个标准OOD检测基准测试中证实了方法的有效性，与现有后处理方法具有广泛的组合兼容性，并达到了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种有效且低成本的OOD检测解决方案，能够显著缓解模型对OOD数据的过度自信问题。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial when deploying deep neural
networks in the real world to ensure the reliability and safety of their
applications. One main challenge in OOD detection is that neural network models
often produce overconfident predictions on OOD data. While some methods using
auxiliary OOD datasets or generating fake OOD images have shown promising OOD
detection performance, they are limited by the high costs of data collection
and training. In this study, we propose a novel and effective OOD detection
method that utilizes local background features as fake OOD features for model
training. Inspired by the observation that OOD images generally share similar
background regions with ID images, the background features are extracted from
ID images as simulated OOD visual representations during training based on the
local invariance of convolution. Through being optimized to reduce the
$L_2$-norm of these background features, the neural networks are able to
alleviate the overconfidence issue on OOD data. Extensive experiments on
multiple standard OOD detection benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our
method and its wide combinatorial compatibility with existing post-hoc methods,
with new state-of-the-art performance achieved from our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督融合方法依赖手工设计的损失函数，存在细节缺失、亮度不均的问题，且梯度损失仅关注梯度幅度而忽略方向。

Method: 设计了跨模态互补掩码模块、细粒度参考图像合成策略（结合拉普拉斯边缘增强和自适应直方图均衡化），以及角度感知损失函数。

Result: 在MSRS、RoadScene和M3FD数据集上的实验表明，AngularFuse明显优于现有主流方法，在挑战性场景中产生更清晰、更详细的结果。

Conclusion: AngularFuse通过同时约束梯度幅度和方向，能够生成纹理强度保持且边缘方向正确的融合图像，具有优越的融合能力。

Abstract: Visible-infrared image fusion is crucial in key applications such as
autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance. Its main goal is to integrate
multimodal information to produce enhanced images that are better suited for
downstream tasks. Although deep learning based fusion methods have made
significant progress, mainstream unsupervised approaches still face serious
challenges in practical applications. Existing methods mostly rely on manually
designed loss functions to guide the fusion process. However, these loss
functions have obvious limitations. On one hand, the reference images
constructed by existing methods often lack details and have uneven brightness.
On the other hand, the widely used gradient losses focus only on gradient
magnitude. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an angle-based
perception framework for spatial-sensitive image fusion (AngularFuse). At
first, we design a cross-modal complementary mask module to force the network
to learn complementary information between modalities. Then, a fine-grained
reference image synthesis strategy is introduced. By combining Laplacian edge
enhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, reference images with richer
details and more balanced brightness are generated. Last but not least, we
introduce an angle-aware loss, which for the first time constrains both
gradient magnitude and direction simultaneously in the gradient domain.
AngularFuse ensures that the fused images preserve both texture intensity and
correct edge orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the MSRS, RoadScene, and
M3FD public datasets show that AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream
methods with clear margin. Visual comparisons further confirm that our method
produces sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes, demonstrating
superior fusion capability.

Motivation: 现有基准主要评估一般医疗任务，无法充分捕捉在脊柱等依赖视觉输入的精细领域的性能表现，需要专门的评估工具。

Method: 整合开源脊柱疾病数据集的图像标签对，基于视觉相似性为每个VQA对采样具有挑战性的硬负选项，模拟真实世界中的困难场景。

Result: 评估了12个领先的MLLMs，结果显示这些模型在脊柱任务中表现不佳，突显了当前MLLM在脊柱领域的局限性。

Conclusion: SpineBench揭示了当前MLLM在脊柱医学应用中的不足，为未来改进提供了指导方向，该基准已公开可用。

Abstract: With the increasing integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
into the medical field, comprehensive evaluation of their performance in
various medical domains becomes critical. However, existing benchmarks
primarily assess general medical tasks, inadequately capturing performance in
nuanced areas like the spine, which relies heavily on visual input. To address
this, we introduce SpineBench, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA)
benchmark designed for fine-grained analysis and evaluation of MLLMs in the
spinal domain. SpineBench comprises 64,878 QA pairs from 40,263 spine images,
covering 11 spinal diseases through two critical clinical tasks: spinal disease
diagnosis and spinal lesion localization, both in multiple-choice format.
SpineBench is built by integrating and standardizing image-label pairs from
open-source spinal disease datasets, and samples challenging hard negative
options for each VQA pair based on visual similarity (similar but not the same
disease), simulating real-world challenging scenarios. We evaluate 12 leading
MLLMs on SpineBench. The results reveal that these models exhibit poor
performance in spinal tasks, highlighting limitations of current MLLM in the
spine domain and guiding future improvements in spinal medicine applications.

Motivation: 解决现有动态3D城市场景重建方法在保真度和计算成本之间的权衡问题，避免对静态背景和安全关键对象采用统一资源分配

Method: 引入语义引导的剪枝和正则化策略，以及基于优先级的渲染流水线，通过混合重要性指标简化非关键元素，保留导航关键对象的细节

Result: 在Waymo和KITTI数据集上实现卓越的重建质量，特别是在安全关键对象上，同时显著减少训练时间，渲染速度提升至350+ FPS

Conclusion: PAGS框架成功地将任务感知语义优先级注入3D重建和渲染流程，实现了保真度和效率的平衡

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D urban scenes is crucial for autonomous driving, yet
current methods face a stark trade-off between fidelity and computational cost.
This inefficiency stems from their semantically agnostic design, which
allocates resources uniformly, treating static backgrounds and safety-critical
objects with equal importance. To address this, we introduce Priority-Adaptive
Gaussian Splatting (PAGS), a framework that injects task-aware semantic
priorities directly into the 3D reconstruction and rendering pipeline. PAGS
introduces two core contributions: (1) Semantically-Guided Pruning and
Regularization strategy, which employs a hybrid importance metric to
aggressively simplify non-critical scene elements while preserving fine-grained
details on objects vital for navigation. (2) Priority-Driven Rendering
pipeline, which employs a priority-based depth pre-pass to aggressively cull
occluded primitives and accelerate the final shading computations. Extensive
experiments on the Waymo and KITTI datasets demonstrate that PAGS achieves
exceptional reconstruction quality, particularly on safety-critical objects,
while significantly reducing training time and boosting rendering speeds to
over 350 FPS.

TL;DR: 提出DL-DKD++框架，通过动态知识蒸馏从大型视觉语言预训练模型向轻量级PRVR网络迁移知识，解决部分相关视频检索问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本-视频检索方法假设视频经过预裁剪且仅包含文本相关内容，但实际视频通常未经裁剪、时长较长且包含复杂背景内容，因此需要解决更实用的部分相关视频检索任务。

Method: 采用双学习框架和动态知识蒸馏，包含继承分支吸收教师模型的可迁移知识，以及探索分支学习PRVR数据集的任务特定信息，并使用动态软目标构建机制替代硬目标监督。

Result: 在TVR、ActivityNet和Charades-STA数据集上实现了最先进的PRVR性能。

Conclusion: 提出的DL-DKD++框架通过知识蒸馏和动态软目标机制，有效解决了部分相关视频检索问题，在多个基准数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: Almost all previous text-to-video retrieval works ideally assume that videos
are pre-trimmed with short durations containing solely text-related content.
However, in practice, videos are typically untrimmed in long durations with
much more complicated background content. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on
the more practical yet challenging task of Partially Relevant Video Retrieval
(PRVR), which aims to retrieve partially relevant untrimmed videos with the
given query. To tackle this task, we propose a novel framework that distills
generalization knowledge from a powerful large-scale vision-language
pre-trained model and transfers it to a lightweight, task-specific PRVR
network. Specifically, we introduce a Dual Learning framework with Dynamic
Knowledge Distillation (DL-DKD++), where a large teacher model provides
supervision to a compact dual-branch student network. The student model
comprises two branches: an inheritance branch that absorbs transferable
knowledge from the teacher, and an exploration branch that learns task-specific
information from the PRVR dataset to address domain gaps. To further enhance
learning, we incorporate a dynamic soft-target construction mechanism. By
replacing rigid hard-target supervision with adaptive soft targets that evolve
during training, our method enables the model to better capture the
fine-grained, partial relevance between videos and queries. Experiment results
demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
TVR, ActivityNet, and Charades-STA datasets for PRVR. The code is available at

TL;DR: 本文研究了视觉语言模型在logo识别中的幻觉问题，发现模型会生成品牌名称或文本内容，即使logo中不包含可见文字。通过分析发现幻觉与投影器子空间密切相关，并提出针对性消融方法可显著减少错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在多模态推理方面取得显著进展，但仍存在幻觉问题，即输出未基于视觉证据。本文特别关注logo幻觉这一被忽视的问题，即模型在logo不含可见文字时仍生成品牌名称或文本内容。

Method: 使用纯符号、混合和含文字logo的精选数据集，以及具有挑战性的Hard-60子集，系统测量领先VLMs的幻觉程度。通过九种结构化扰动测试鲁棒性，并对开源LLaVA进行嵌入级分析，识别与幻觉相关的投影器维度。

Result: 研究发现幻觉在强失真下仍然存在，遮挡暴露了最明显的弱点。幻觉与投影器的小部分维度相关，针对性消融可显著减少错误，同时保持OCR准确性。模型往往依赖符号先验而非真正的字形感知，特别是对于标志性圆形logo。

Conclusion: 投影器子空间在这种失败模式中起决定性作用。本文贡献了新的诊断视角和可行的缓解见解，强调投影器解耦和OCR引导解码是构建更可信多模态系统的有前景方向。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal
reasoning; yet, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, where outputs are not
grounded in visual evidence. In this paper, we investigate a previously
overlooked setting: logo hallucination, where models generate brand names or
textual content despite logos containing no visible words. Using curated splits
of pure symbols, hybrids, and text-bearing logos, as well as the challenging
Hard-60 subset, we systematically measure hallucination across leading VLMs. We
further probe robustness through nine structured perturbations and show that
hallucinations persist even under strong distortions, with occlusion exposing
the sharpest weaknesses. Embedding-level analysis with open-weight LLaVA
demonstrates that hallucination is tied to a small subset of projector
dimensions, and targeted ablation substantially reduces errors while preserving
OCR accuracy. Together, these findings reveal that VLMs often rely on symbolic
priors rather than genuine glyph perception, particularly for iconic circular
logos, and that projector subspaces play a decisive role in this failure mode.
Our work contributes both a novel diagnostic lens and actionable mitigation
insights, highlighting projector disentanglement and OCR-guided decoding as
promising directions for building more trustworthy multimodal systems.

Abstract: This paper describes the Qualcomm AI Research solution to the RealADSim-NVS
challenge, hosted at the RealADSim Workshop at ICCV 2025. The challenge
concerns novel view synthesis in street scenes, and participants are required
to generate, starting from car-centric frames captured during some training
traversals, renders of the same urban environment as viewed from a different
traversal (e.g. different street lane or car direction). Our solution is
inspired by hybrid methods in scene generation and generative simulators
merging gaussian splatting and diffusion models, and it is composed of two
stages: First, we fit a 3D reconstruction of the scene and render novel views
as seen from the target cameras. Then, we enhance the resulting frames with a
dedicated single-step diffusion model. We discuss specific choices made in the
initialization of gaussian primitives as well as the finetuning of the enhancer
model and its training data curation. We report the performance of our model
design and we ablate its components in terms of novel view quality as measured
by PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS. On the public leaderboard reporting test results, our
proposal reaches an aggregated score of 0.432, achieving the second place

TL;DR: CurriFlow是一个用于语义场景补全的新框架，通过光流时序对齐和课程学习深度融合，提升相机感知在自动驾驶中的3D几何和语义推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语义场景补全方法依赖时序堆叠或深度投影，缺乏明确的运动推理，难以处理遮挡和噪声深度监督。

Method: 采用多级融合策略，使用预训练光流对齐分割、视觉和深度特征；通过课程学习机制从稀疏LiDAR深度渐进过渡到密集立体深度；利用SAM提供类别无关的语义先验。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI基准测试中达到16.9的平均IoU，实现最先进性能。

Conclusion: CurriFlow的运动引导和课程感知设计有效提升了基于相机的3D语义场景补全性能。

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to infer complete 3D geometry and
semantics from monocular images, serving as a crucial capability for
camera-based perception in autonomous driving. However, existing SSC methods
relying on temporal stacking or depth projection often lack explicit motion
reasoning and struggle with occlusions and noisy depth supervision. We propose
CurriFlow, a novel semantic occupancy prediction framework that integrates
optical flow-based temporal alignment with curriculum-guided depth fusion.
CurriFlow employs a multi-level fusion strategy to align segmentation, visual,
and depth features across frames using pre-trained optical flow, thereby
improving temporal consistency and dynamic object understanding. To enhance
geometric robustness, a curriculum learning mechanism progressively transitions
from sparse yet accurate LiDAR depth to dense but noisy stereo depth during
training, ensuring stable optimization and seamless adaptation to real-world
deployment. Furthermore, semantic priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
provide category-agnostic supervision, strengthening voxel-level semantic
learning and spatial consistency. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI benchmark
demonstrate that CurriFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean
IoU of 16.9, validating the effectiveness of our motion-guided and
curriculum-aware design for camera-based 3D semantic scene completion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可学习的自适应子采样框架，通过注意力引导的动态采样机制减少深度神经网络的计算复杂度，特别适用于3D医学影像和超声视频分类任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络性能提升往往伴随计算复杂度和成本的增加，特别是在3D体积或视频分类任务中，由于固有的冗余性，并非所有切片或帧都是必要的。现有方法只能任务自适应而不能输入自适应，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出注意力引导的采样模块，使用可学习的子采样框架克服不可微操作问题，在推理过程中也能根据输入动态调整采样策略。

Result: 在MedMNIST3D医学影像数据集和两个超声视频数据集（包括真实临床条件下收集的具有挑战性的内部数据集）上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该动态自适应方法能够提升性能并降低深度神经网络模型的复杂度，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Although deep neural networks have provided impressive gains in performance,
these improvements often come at the cost of increased computational complexity
and expense. In many cases, such as 3D volume or video classification tasks,
not all slices or frames are necessary due to inherent redundancies. To address
this issue, we propose a novel learnable subsampling framework that can be
integrated into any neural network architecture. Subsampling, being a
nondifferentiable operation, poses significant challenges for direct adaptation
into deep learning models. While some works, have proposed solutions using the
Gumbel-max trick to overcome the problem of non-differentiability, they fall
short in a crucial aspect: they are only task-adaptive and not inputadaptive.
Once the sampling mechanism is learned, it remains static and does not adjust
to different inputs, making it unsuitable for real-world applications. To this
end, we propose an attention-guided sampling module that adapts to inputs even
during inference. This dynamic adaptation results in performance gains and
reduces complexity in deep neural network models. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D as
well as two ultrasound video datasets for classification tasks, one of them
being a challenging in-house dataset collected under real-world clinical
conditions.

TL;DR: 提出STORM-PSR双流框架，结合空间和时间特征来解决程序步骤识别中物体遮挡问题，相比现有方法显著减少了步骤完成预测延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有最先进模型仅依赖检测单个视频帧中的装配物体状态，忽略了时间特征，导致在物体部分遮挡时模型鲁棒性和准确性受限。

Method: 提出双流框架：装配状态检测流处理无遮挡视图，时空流通过空间编码器和基于Transformer的时间编码器捕获空间和时间特征，即使在部分遮挡下也能识别步骤完成。

Result: 在MECCANO和IndustReal数据集上，相比先前方法分别减少了11.2%和26.1%的装配步骤完成预测平均延迟。

Conclusion: STORM-PSR通过时空流不依赖物体无遮挡视图来推断完成步骤，显著提高了程序步骤识别的性能。

Abstract: Procedure step recognition (PSR) aims to identify all correctly completed
steps and their sequential order in videos of procedural tasks. The existing
state-of-the-art models rely solely on detecting assembly object states in
individual video frames. By neglecting temporal features, model robustness and
accuracy are limited, especially when objects are partially occluded. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Occlusion-Resilient
Modeling for Procedure Step Recognition (STORM-PSR), a dual-stream framework
for PSR that leverages both spatial and temporal features. The assembly state
detection stream operates effectively with unobstructed views of the object,
while the spatio-temporal stream captures both spatial and temporal features to
recognize step completions even under partial occlusion. This stream includes a
spatial encoder, pre-trained using a novel weakly supervised approach to
capture meaningful spatial representations, and a transformer-based temporal
encoder that learns how these spatial features relate over time. STORM-PSR is
evaluated on the MECCANO and IndustReal datasets, reducing the average delay
between actual and predicted assembly step completions by 11.2% and 26.1%,
respectively, compared to prior methods. We demonstrate that this reduction in
delay is driven by the spatio-temporal stream, which does not rely on
unobstructed views of the object to infer completed steps. The code for
STORM-PSR, along with the newly annotated MECCANO labels, is made publicly
available at https://timschoonbeek.github.io/stormpsr .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当训练图像缺乏足够多视角约束时，场景坐标回归模型会退化，需要引入先验知识来提升学习效果

Method: 通过概率化重新解释SCR训练，引入多种先验：从简单的重建深度分布先验到基于大室内扫描数据集训练的3D点云扩散模型先验

Result: 在三个室内数据集上，先验帮助学习到更好的场景表示，产生更一致的点云、更高的配准率和更好的相机位姿

Conclusion: 提出的先验方法能有效提升场景坐标回归模型的性能，对下游任务如新视角合成和相机重定位有积极影响

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) models have proven to be powerful implicit
scene representations for 3D vision, enabling visual relocalization and
structure-from-motion. SCR models are trained specifically for one scene. If
training images imply insufficient multi-view constraints SCR models
degenerate. We present a probabilistic reinterpretation of training SCR models,
which allows us to infuse high-level reconstruction priors. We investigate
multiple such priors, ranging from simple priors over the distribution of
reconstructed depth values to learned priors over plausible scene coordinate
configurations. For the latter, we train a 3D point cloud diffusion model on a
large corpus of indoor scans. Our priors push predicted 3D scene points towards
plausible geometry at each training step to increase their likelihood. On three
indoor datasets our priors help learning better scene representations,
resulting in more coherent scene point clouds, higher registration rates and
better camera poses, with a positive effect on down-stream tasks such as novel
view synthesis and camera relocalization.

Motivation: 传统城市基础设施监测方法依赖物联网传感器和人工检查，成本高、难以扩展，且与公民的视觉感知存在差异。研究探索VLM是否能像公民一样"看到"并推断城市基础设施状况。

Method: 采用PRISMA方法论，分析了2021-2025年间发表的32篇同行评审研究，重点关注VLM在零样本应用中的表现。

Result: 研究发现VLM在城市监测任务中展现出潜力，特别是在处理多样化对象、环境和上下文条件方面。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型为城市基础设施监测提供了一种有前景的技术路径，能够更好地与公民的视觉感知保持一致。

Abstract: Urban monitoring of public infrastructure (such as waste bins, road signs,
vegetation, sidewalks, and construction sites) poses significant challenges due
to the diversity of objects, environments, and contextual conditions involved.
Current state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on a combination of IoT
sensors and manual inspections, which are costly, difficult to scale, and often
misaligned with citizens' perception formed through direct visual observation.
This raises a critical question: Can machines now "see" like citizens and infer
informed opinions about the condition of urban infrastructure? Vision-Language
Models (VLMs), which integrate visual understanding with natural language
reasoning, have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in processing
complex visual information, turning them into a promising technology to address
this challenge. This systematic review investigates the role of VLMs in urban
monitoring, with particular emphasis on zero-shot applications. Following the
PRISMA methodology, we analyzed 32 peer-reviewed studies published between 2021
and 2025 to address four core research questions: (1) What urban monitoring
tasks have been effectively addressed using VLMs? (2) Which VLM architectures
and frameworks are most commonly used and demonstrate superior performance? (3)
What datasets and resources support this emerging field? (4) How are VLM-based
applications evaluated, and what performance levels have been reported?

*Huu Tien Nguyen,Ahmed Karam Eldaly*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于条件流匹配(CFM)的图像质量迁移框架，用于从低场MRI重建高场质量图像，在性能和泛化能力上达到最先进水平且参数更少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低场MRI(LF-MRI)虽然成本低、便携性好，但信噪比低、诊断质量差，需要一种方法在不增加昂贵基础设施的情况下提升图像质量。

Method: 使用条件流匹配(CFM)框架，通过直接回归最优速度场来学习噪声分布与目标数据分布之间的连续流，替代传统的迭代采样或对抗目标。

Result: CFM在低场MRI到高场质量图像重建中达到最先进性能，对分布内和分布外数据都具有鲁棒泛化能力，且参数使用量显著少于竞争深度学习方法。

Conclusion: CFM是MRI重建的强大可扩展工具，特别适合资源有限的临床环境，能够有效弥合低场与高场MRI之间的质量差距。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for image quality transfer based on
conditional flow matching (CFM). Unlike conventional generative models that
rely on iterative sampling or adversarial objectives, CFM learns a continuous
flow between a noise distribution and target data distributions through the
direct regression of an optimal velocity field. We evaluate this approach in
the context of low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LF-MRI), a rapidly
emerging modality that offers affordable and portable scanning but suffers from
inherently low signal-to-noise ratio and reduced diagnostic quality. Our
framework is designed to reconstruct high-field-like MR images from their
corresponding low-field inputs, thereby bridging the quality gap without
requiring expensive infrastructure. Experiments demonstrate that CFM not only
achieves state-of-the-art performance, but also generalizes robustly to both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Importantly, it does so while
utilizing significantly fewer parameters than competing deep learning methods.
These results underline the potential of CFM as a powerful and scalable tool
for MRI reconstruction, particularly in resource-limited clinical environments.

TL;DR: VideoLucy是一个基于深度记忆回溯的长视频理解框架，通过分层记忆结构和迭代回溯机制解决现有方法在时序理解和关键信息保留方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的代理系统在长视频理解中存在两个主要问题：1）在单帧上建模推理，难以捕捉连续帧的时序上下文；2）稀疏帧采样可能丢失关键信息。

Method: 采用分层记忆结构，从粗到细定义不同层次的记忆细节和时序范围，通过基于代理的迭代回溯机制系统挖掘视频范围内的深度记忆。

Result: 在多个长视频理解基准测试中显著优于现有最先进方法，甚至超越GPT-4o等专有模型。

Conclusion: VideoLucy通过深度记忆回溯框架有效解决了长视频理解中的时序建模和关键信息保留问题，展现了优越性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that agent-based systems leveraging large language
models (LLMs) for key information retrieval and integration have emerged as a
promising approach for long video understanding. However, these systems face
two major challenges. First, they typically perform modeling and reasoning on
individual frames, struggling to capture the temporal context of consecutive
frames. Second, to reduce the cost of dense frame-level captioning, they adopt
sparse frame sampling, which risks discarding crucial information. To overcome
these limitations, we propose VideoLucy, a deep memory backtracking framework
for long video understanding. Inspired by the human recollection process from
coarse to fine, VideoLucy employs a hierarchical memory structure with
progressive granularity. This structure explicitly defines the detail level and
temporal scope of memory at different hierarchical depths. Through an
agent-based iterative backtracking mechanism, VideoLucy systematically mines
video-wide, question-relevant deep memories until sufficient information is
gathered to provide a confident answer. This design enables effective temporal
understanding of consecutive frames while preserving critical details. In
addition, we introduce EgoMem, a new benchmark for long video understanding.
EgoMem is designed to comprehensively evaluate a model's ability to understand
complex events that unfold over time and capture fine-grained details in
extremely long videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
VideoLucy. Built on open-source models, VideoLucy significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on multiple long video understanding benchmarks,
achieving performance even surpassing the latest proprietary models such as
GPT-4o. Our code and dataset will be made publicly at

TL;DR: 这篇论文是关于纵向放射学报告生成（LRRG）的首个系统性综述，特别关注胸部X光片纵向数据的应用，旨在填补现有单图像方法无法捕捉临床对比信息的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胸部X光成像在现代医学中广泛应用，给放射科医生带来沉重负担。现有方法主要依赖单张图像，无法捕捉纵向临床背景来生成准确的对比描述，需要系统性框架来指导纵向放射学报告生成模型的设计。

Method: 通过全面回顾纵向放射学报告生成领域，分析数据集构建策略、报告生成架构的纵向定制设计、评估协议（包括纵向特定指标和广泛使用的基准），并总结LRRG方法的性能表现和消融研究分析。

Result: 分析表明纵向信息和架构设计选择在提升模型性能中起关键作用，总结了当前研究的五大主要局限性。

Conclusion: 为推进这一新兴领域的发展奠定了基础，并概述了未来发展的有前景方向。

Abstract: Chest Xray imaging is a widely used diagnostic tool in modern medicine, and
its high utilization creates substantial workloads for radiologists. To
alleviate this burden, vision language models are increasingly applied to
automate Chest Xray radiology report generation (CXRRRG), aiming for clinically
accurate descriptions while reducing manual effort. Conventional approaches,
however, typically rely on single images, failing to capture the longitudinal
context necessary for producing clinically faithful comparison statements.
Recently, growing attention has been directed toward incorporating longitudinal
data into CXR RRG, enabling models to leverage historical studies in ways that
mirror radiologists diagnostic workflows. Nevertheless, existing surveys
primarily address single image CXRRRG and offer limited guidance for
longitudinal settings, leaving researchers without a systematic framework for
model design. To address this gap, this survey provides the first comprehensive
review of longitudinal radiology report generation (LRRG). Specifically, we
examine dataset construction strategies, report generation architectures
alongside longitudinally tailored designs, and evaluation protocols
encompassing both longitudinal specific measures and widely used benchmarks. We
further summarize LRRG methods performance, alongside analyses of different
ablation studies, which collectively highlight the critical role of
longitudinal information and architectural design choices in improving model
performance. Finally, we summarize five major limitations of current research
and outline promising directions for future development, aiming to lay a
foundation for advancing this emerging field.

Motivation: 针对深度伪造检测器在未知模型上的可转移性攻击问题，需要同时保证攻击效果和视觉不可感知性。

Method: 第一阶段使用MNTD-PGD进行小扰动预算的梯度计算，SG-PGD聚焦视觉显著区域；第二阶段基于黑盒模型成功率和结构相似性选择候选样本。

Result: 在未见检测器上实现了比现有攻击方法高27%的错误分类率。

Conclusion: MS-GAGA通过两阶段设计有效提升了对抗样本的可转移性和不可感知性。

Abstract: We present MS-GAGA (Metric-Selective Guided Adversarial Generation Attack), a
two-stage framework for crafting transferable and visually imperceptible
adversarial examples against deepfake detectors in black-box settings. In Stage
1, a dual-stream attack module generates adversarial candidates: MNTD-PGD
applies enhanced gradient calculations optimized for small perturbation
budgets, while SG-PGD focuses perturbations on visually salient regions. This
complementary design expands the adversarial search space and improves
transferability across unseen models. In Stage 2, a metric-aware selection
module evaluates candidates based on both their success against black-box
models and their structural similarity (SSIM) to the original image. By jointly
optimizing transferability and imperceptibility, MS-GAGA achieves up to 27%
higher misclassification rates on unseen detectors compared to state-of-the-art
attacks.

Abstract: Deep learning relies heavily on data augmentation to mitigate limited data,
especially in medical imaging. Recent multimodal learning integrates text and
images for segmentation, known as referring or text-guided image segmentation.
However, common augmentations like rotation and flipping disrupt spatial
alignment between image and text, weakening performance. To address this, we
propose an early fusion framework that combines text and visual features before
augmentation, preserving spatial consistency. We also design a lightweight
generator that projects text embeddings into visual space, bridging semantic
gaps. Visualization of generated pseudo-images shows accurate region
localization. Our method is evaluated on three medical imaging tasks and four
segmentation frameworks, achieving state-of-the-art results. Code is publicly

Conclusion: BSGS框架能够从运动模糊图像中准确重建3D场景，解决了现有方法的局限性，在去模糊性能上表现优越。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has exhibited remarkable capabilities in 3D scene
reconstruction.However, reconstructing high-quality 3D scenes from
motion-blurred images caused by camera motion poses a significant challenge.The
performance of existing 3DGS-based deblurring methods are limited due to their
inherent mechanisms, such as extreme dependence on the accuracy of camera poses
and inability to effectively control erroneous Gaussian primitives
densification caused by motion blur.To solve these problems, we introduce a
novel framework, Bi-Stage 3D Gaussian Splatting, to accurately reconstruct 3D
scenes from motion-blurred images.BSGS contains two stages. First, Camera Pose
Refinement roughly optimizes camera poses to reduce motion-induced distortions.
Second, with fixed rough camera poses, Global RigidTransformation further
corrects motion-induced blur distortions.To alleviate multi-subframe gradient
conflicts, we propose a subframe gradient aggregation strategy to optimize both
stages.Furthermore, a space-time bi-stage optimization strategy is introduced
to dynamically adjust primitive densification thresholds and prevent premature
noisy Gaussian generation in blurred regions. Comprehensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of our proposed deblurring method and show its superiority
over the state of the arts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经方法学习无符号距离场时存在数值不稳定、计算成本高和可控性有限的问题，需要一种更稳定高效的替代方案。

Method: 使用Voronoi辅助扩散方法：首先基于两个Voronoi几何准则为输入点分配双向法向量，然后扩散对齐的法向量形成近似UDF梯度场，最后积分得到最终UDF。

Result: VAD能够稳健处理水密和开放表面，以及复杂的非流形和非定向几何结构，同时保持计算效率和稳定性。

Conclusion: VAD提供了一种计算高效、数值稳定的无符号距离场计算方法，能够处理各种复杂几何拓扑结构。

Abstract: Unsigned Distance Fields (UDFs) provide a flexible representation for 3D
shapes with arbitrary topology, including open and closed surfaces, orientable
and non-orientable geometries, and non-manifold structures. While recent neural
approaches have shown promise in learning UDFs, they often suffer from
numerical instability, high computational cost, and limited controllability. We
present a lightweight, network-free method, Voronoi-Assisted Diffusion (VAD),
for computing UDFs directly from unoriented point clouds. Our approach begins
by assigning bi-directional normals to input points, guided by two
Voronoi-based geometric criteria encoded in an energy function for optimal
alignment. The aligned normals are then diffused to form an approximate UDF
gradient field, which is subsequently integrated to recover the final UDF.
Experiments demonstrate that VAD robustly handles watertight and open surfaces,
as well as complex non-manifold and non-orientable geometries, while remaining
computationally efficient and stable.

Conclusion: 通过理论驱动的组件设计和针对性消融实验，证明了所提方法的有效性，为人体运动生成提供了更简洁高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent work has explored a range of model families for human motion
generation, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), and diffusion-based models. Despite their differences, many
methods rely on over-parameterized input features and auxiliary losses to
improve empirical results. These strategies should not be strictly necessary
for diffusion models to match the human motion distribution. We show that on
par with state-of-the-art results in unconditional human motion generation are
achievable with a score-based diffusion model using only careful feature-space
normalization and analytically derived weightings for the standard L2
score-matching loss, while generating both motion and shape directly, thereby
avoiding slow post hoc shape recovery from joints. We build the method step by
step, with a clear theoretical motivation for each component, and provide
targeted ablations demonstrating the effectiveness of each proposed addition in
isolation.

Conclusion: CoIRL-AD框架有效结合IL和RL的优势，超越传统两阶段方法，在自动驾驶任务中取得显著性能提升。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving models trained solely with imitation learning
(IL) often suffer from poor generalization. In contrast, reinforcement learning
(RL) promotes exploration through reward maximization but faces challenges such
as sample inefficiency and unstable convergence. A natural solution is to
combine IL and RL. Moving beyond the conventional two-stage paradigm (IL
pretraining followed by RL fine-tuning), we propose CoIRL-AD, a competitive
dual-policy framework that enables IL and RL agents to interact during
training. CoIRL-AD introduces a competition-based mechanism that facilitates
knowledge exchange while preventing gradient conflicts. Experiments on the
nuScenes dataset show an 18% reduction in collision rate compared to baselines,
along with stronger generalization and improved performance on long-tail
scenarios. Code is available at: https://github.com/SEU-zxj/CoIRL-AD.

Method: 1) 构建大规模多光谱无人机数据集MMOT；2) 提出轻量级光谱3D-Stem集成光谱特征；3) 方向感知卡尔曼滤波器用于精确状态估计；4) 端到端方向自适应transformer。

Result: 多光谱输入相比RGB基线显著提升跟踪性能，特别是对小目标和密集物体效果明显。

Conclusion: MMOT基准和多光谱跟踪方案将推动无人机多光谱多目标跟踪研究的发展。

Abstract: Drone-based multi-object tracking is essential yet highly challenging due to
small targets, severe occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds. Existing RGB-based
tracking algorithms heavily depend on spatial appearance cues such as color and
texture, which often degrade in aerial views, compromising reliability.
Multispectral imagery, capturing pixel-level spectral reflectance, provides
crucial cues that enhance object discriminability under degraded spatial
conditions. However, the lack of dedicated multispectral UAV datasets has
hindered progress in this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMOT, the
first challenging benchmark for drone-based multispectral multi-object
tracking. It features three key characteristics: (i) Large Scale - 125 video
sequences with over 488.8K annotations across eight categories; (ii)
Comprehensive Challenges - covering diverse conditions such as extreme small
targets, high-density scenarios, severe occlusions, and complex motion; and
(iii) Precise Oriented Annotations - enabling accurate localization and reduced
ambiguity under aerial perspectives. To better extract spectral features and
leverage oriented annotations, we further present a multispectral and
orientation-aware MOT scheme adapting existing methods, featuring: (i) a
lightweight Spectral 3D-Stem integrating spectral features while preserving
compatibility with RGB pretraining; (ii) an orientation-aware Kalman filter for
precise state estimation; and (iii) an end-to-end orientation-adaptive
transformer. Extensive experiments across representative trackers consistently
show that multispectral input markedly improves tracking performance over RGB
baselines, particularly for small and densely packed objects. We believe our
work will advance drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking research. Our
MMOT, code, and benchmarks are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Temporally Conditional Mamba模型，通过将条件信息整合到Mamba块的循环动态中，解决了现有方法在时间对齐方面的不足，显著提升了运动生成的时间对齐性、真实性和条件一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于交叉注意力机制的方法主要捕获全局交互，但难以维持逐步时间对齐，这限制了基于时间相关输入信号的人类运动生成效果。

Method: 引入基于Mamba的Temporally Conditional Mamba模型，将条件信息整合到Mamba块的循环动态中，实现更好的时间对齐运动生成。

Result: 在多种人类运动任务上的广泛实验表明，该方法在时间对齐、运动真实性和条件一致性方面显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的Temporally Conditional Mamba模型有效解决了时间对齐问题，为基于条件输入的人类运动生成提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Learning human motion based on a time-dependent input signal presents a
challenging yet impactful task with various applications. The goal of this task
is to generate or estimate human movement that consistently reflects the
temporal patterns of conditioning inputs. Existing methods typically rely on
cross-attention mechanisms to fuse the condition with motion. However, this
approach primarily captures global interactions and struggles to maintain
step-by-step temporal alignment. To address this limitation, we introduce
Temporally Conditional Mamba, a new mamba-based model for human motion
generation. Our approach integrates conditional information into the recurrent
dynamics of the Mamba block, enabling better temporally aligned motion. To
validate the effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on a variety of human
motion tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model significantly
improves temporal alignment, motion realism, and condition consistency over
state-of-the-art approaches. Our project page is available at

TL;DR: 提出一种零样本农业图像分割方法，结合Plantnet植物分类模型、DinoV2骨干网络和SAM分割模型，无需收集新数据集即可实现植物区域分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决农业图像分割中的标注瓶颈问题，利用现有植物专用模型避免收集和标注新数据集的需求。

Method: 使用Plantnet的植物专用表示识别植物区域生成粗分割掩码，然后通过SAM进行精细化分割。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上评估，使用Plantnet微调的DinoV2相比基础DinoV2模型在IoU指标上获得一致性能提升。

Conclusion: 结合基础模型和植物专用模型可以有效缓解标注瓶颈，在多样化农业场景中实现有效分割。

Abstract: We present a zero-shot segmentation approach for agricultural imagery that
leverages Plantnet, a large-scale plant classification model, in conjunction
with its DinoV2 backbone and the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Rather than
collecting and annotating new datasets, our method exploits Plantnet's
specialized plant representations to identify plant regions and produce coarse
segmentation masks. These masks are then refined by SAM to yield detailed
segmentations. We evaluate on four publicly available datasets of various
complexity in terms of contrast including some where the limited size of the
training data and complex field conditions often hinder purely supervised
methods. Our results show consistent performance gains when using
Plantnet-fine-tuned DinoV2 over the base DinoV2 model, as measured by the
Jaccard Index (IoU). These findings highlight the potential of combining
foundation models with specialized plant-centric models to alleviate the
annotation bottleneck and enable effective segmentation in diverse agricultural
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerSync是一种领域无关的方法，通过使用扩散模型自身的中间表示作为内在指导来提升生成质量和训练效率，无需外部监督或预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明扩散模型中间表示的质量与生成质量相关，外部指导可以加速训练。本文重新思考这一范式，利用模型自身丰富的中间表示来指导较弱的表示，减少对外部监督的需求。

Method: LayerSync是一种即插即用的正则化方法，通过同步扩散模型不同层的中间表示来实现。它利用语义丰富的层表示来指导较弱层，无需额外计算开销，适用于多种模态。

Result: 在图像生成任务上，LayerSync将基于流的transformer训练速度提升了8.75倍，生成质量提高了23.6%。该方法还成功应用于音频、视频和运动生成等其他领域。

Conclusion: LayerSync是一种高效的自监督正则化方法，能显著提升扩散模型的训练效率和生成质量，且具有领域通用性，无需外部模型或数据。

Abstract: We propose LayerSync, a domain-agnostic approach for improving the generation
quality and the training efficiency of diffusion models. Prior studies have
highlighted the connection between the quality of generation and the
representations learned by diffusion models, showing that external guidance on
model intermediate representations accelerates training. We reconceptualize
this paradigm by regularizing diffusion models with their own intermediate
representations. Building on the observation that representation quality varies
across diffusion model layers, we show that the most semantically rich
representations can act as an intrinsic guidance for weaker ones, reducing the
need for external supervision. Our approach, LayerSync, is a self-sufficient,
plug-and-play regularizer term with no overhead on diffusion model training and
generalizes beyond the visual domain to other modalities. LayerSync requires no
pretrained models nor additional data. We extensively evaluate the method on
image generation and demonstrate its applicability to other domains such as
audio, video, and motion generation. We show that it consistently improves the
generation quality and the training efficiency. For example, we speed up the
training of flow-based transformer by over 8.75x on ImageNet dataset and
improved the generation quality by 23.6%. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段训练框架，显著提升了像素空间扩散模型和一致性模型的性能，在ImageNet上取得了接近VAE模型的生成质量，同时实现了无需预训练VAE的高分辨率一致性模型训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决像素空间生成模型训练困难、性能低于潜在空间模型的问题，缩小两者之间的性能和效率差距。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：第一阶段预训练编码器捕捉干净图像的语义信息并与确定性采样轨迹对齐；第二阶段将编码器与随机初始化解码器集成，对完整模型进行端到端微调。

Result: 在ImageNet-256上扩散模型FID达到2.04，ImageNet-512上达到2.35（75 NFE）；一致性模型在ImageNet-256上单步采样FID达到8.82，大幅超越潜在空间对应模型。

Conclusion: 该框架成功缩小了像素空间与潜在空间生成模型的性能差距，首次实现了无需预训练VAE或扩散模型的高分辨率一致性模型直接训练。

Abstract: Pixel-space generative models are often more difficult to train and generally
underperform compared to their latent-space counterparts, leaving a persistent
performance and efficiency gap. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage
training framework that closes this gap for pixel-space diffusion and
consistency models. In the first stage, we pre-train encoders to capture
meaningful semantics from clean images while aligning them with points along
the same deterministic sampling trajectory, which evolves points from the prior
to the data distribution. In the second stage, we integrate the encoder with a
randomly initialized decoder and fine-tune the complete model end-to-end for
both diffusion and consistency models. Our training framework demonstrates
strong empirical performance on ImageNet dataset. Specifically, our diffusion
model reaches an FID of 2.04 on ImageNet-256 and 2.35 on ImageNet-512 with 75
number of function evaluations (NFE), surpassing prior pixel-space methods by a
large margin in both generation quality and efficiency while rivaling leading
VAE-based models at comparable training cost. Furthermore, on ImageNet-256, our
consistency model achieves an impressive FID of 8.82 in a single sampling step,
significantly surpassing its latent-space counterpart. To the best of our
knowledge, this marks the first successful training of a consistency model
directly on high-resolution images without relying on pre-trained VAEs or
diffusion models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态推理方法依赖显式推理步骤，需要大量视觉-文本标注且推理延迟高，需要更高效的方法。

Method: IVT-LR在潜在空间中注入视觉和文本信息，每个推理步骤包含潜在文本（前一步隐藏状态）和潜在视觉（选定图像嵌入），采用渐进多阶段训练策略。

Result: 在M3CoT和ScienceQA数据集上，准确率平均提升5.45%，推理速度提升5倍以上。

Conclusion: IVT-LR方法有效解决了多模态推理中的效率和标注成本问题，为多模态大语言模型提供了更高效的推理方案。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning aims to enhance the capabilities of MLLMs by
incorporating intermediate reasoning steps before reaching the final answer. It
has evolved from text-only reasoning to the integration of visual information,
enabling the thought process to be conveyed through both images and text.
Despite its effectiveness, current multimodal reasoning methods depend on
explicit reasoning steps that require labor-intensive vision-text annotations
and inherently introduce significant inference latency. To address these
issues, we introduce multimodal latent reasoning with the advantages of
multimodal representation, reduced annotation, and inference efficiency. To
facilicate it, we propose Interleaved Vision-Text Latent Reasoning (IVT-LR),
which injects both visual and textual information in the reasoning process
within the latent space. Specifically, IVT-LR represents each reasoning step by
combining two implicit parts: latent text (the hidden states from the previous
step) and latent vision (a set of selected image embeddings). We further
introduce a progressive multi-stage training strategy to enable MLLMs to
perform the above multimodal latent reasoning steps. Experiments on M3CoT and
ScienceQA demonstrate that our IVT-LR method achieves an average performance
increase of 5.45% in accuracy, while simultaneously achieving a speed increase
of over 5 times compared to existing approaches. Code available at

Method: 基于整流流的框架，将水下物理成像信息作为显式先验直接融入网络训练过程，并引入时间维度建模。

Result: 在USOD10K数据集上，WaterFlow在S_m指标上获得0.072的提升，证明了方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: 将水下物理成像信息作为显式先验并结合时间维度建模，能够显著增强水下显著目标检测模型的识别能力。

Abstract: Underwater Salient Object Detection (USOD) faces significant challenges,
including underwater image quality degradation and domain gaps. Existing
methods tend to ignore the physical principles of underwater imaging or simply
treat degradation phenomena in underwater images as interference factors that
must be eliminated, failing to fully exploit the valuable information they
contain. We propose WaterFlow, a rectified flow-based framework for underwater
salient object detection that innovatively incorporates underwater physical
imaging information as explicit priors directly into the network training
process and introduces temporal dimension modeling, significantly enhancing the
model's capability for salient object identification. On the USOD10K dataset,
WaterFlow achieves a 0.072 gain in S_m, demonstrating the effectiveness and
superiority of our method. The code will be published after the acceptance.

Motivation: 现有零样本去噪方法训练时间长，且依赖噪声独立性和零均值假设，限制了在真实世界复杂噪声场景中的有效性。

Method: 利用图像纹理在不同频带间具有位置相似性和内容一致性的特性，而噪声不具备此特性，开发了跨频一致性损失和超轻量网络实现图像去噪。

Result: 在多个真实世界图像数据集上的实验表明，ZSCFC在计算效率和去噪性能方面优于其他最先进的零样本方法。

Conclusion: ZSCFC方法能够有效处理真实世界复杂噪声，不依赖噪声分布假设，具有高效和优越的去噪性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot denoisers address the dataset dependency of deep-learning-based
denoisers, enabling the denoising of unseen single images. Nonetheless,
existing zero-shot methods suffer from long training times and rely on the
assumption of noise independence and a zero-mean property, limiting their
effectiveness in real-world denoising scenarios where noise characteristics are
more complicated. This paper proposes an efficient and effective method for
real-world denoising, the Zero-Shot denoiser based on Cross-Frequency
Consistency (ZSCFC), which enables training and denoising with a single noisy
image and does not rely on assumptions about noise distribution. Specifically,
image textures exhibit position similarity and content consistency across
different frequency bands, while noise does not. Based on this property, we
developed cross-frequency consistency loss and an ultralight network to realize
image denoising. Experiments on various real-world image datasets demonstrate
that our ZSCFC outperforms other state-of-the-art zero-shot methods in terms of
computational efficiency and denoising performance.

Motivation: 现有最先进的人体网格恢复方法依赖大型非分层视觉变换器作为编码器，计算成本高。研究旨在开发简单高效的模型，探索分层视觉基础模型的早期阶段是否能提供更好的精度与效率平衡。

Method: 首先构建了三个轻量级HMR2.0变体作为基准，然后提出使用分层视觉基础模型（如Swin Transformer、GroupMixFormer和VMamba）的前两个或三个阶段作为编码器，基于这些模型的中级特征图分辨率与非分层模型相当或更高的观察。

Result: 评估了27个基于分层视觉基础模型的人体网格恢复和人体姿态估计模型，发现仅使用前两或三个阶段就能达到与全阶段模型相当的性能，且截断模型在精度和计算效率之间展现出更好的权衡。

Conclusion: 分层视觉基础模型的早期阶段能够有效用于人体网格恢复和人体姿态估计任务，提供比现有轻量级替代方案更优的精度-效率平衡，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we aim to develop simple and efficient models for human mesh
recovery (HMR) and its predecessor task, human pose estimation (HPE).
State-of-the-art HMR methods, such as HMR2.0 and its successors, rely on large,
non-hierarchical vision transformers as encoders, which are inherited from the
corresponding HPE models like ViTPose. To establish baselines across varying
computational budgets, we first construct three lightweight HMR2.0 variants by
adapting the corresponding ViTPose models. In addition, we propose leveraging
the early stages of hierarchical vision foundation models (VFMs), including
Swin Transformer, GroupMixFormer, and VMamba, as encoders. This design is
motivated by the observation that intermediate stages of hierarchical VFMs
produce feature maps with resolutions comparable to or higher than those of
non-hierarchical counterparts. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 27
hierarchical-VFM-based HMR and HPE models, demonstrating that using only the
first two or three stages achieves performance on par with full-stage models.
Moreover, we show that the resulting truncated models exhibit better trade-offs
between accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing lightweight
alternatives.

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) satellites produce massive streams of multispectral
image time series, posing pressing challenges for storage and transmission.
Yet, learned EO compression remains fragmented, lacking publicly available
pretrained models and misaligned with advances in compression for natural
imagery. Image codecs overlook temporal redundancy, while video codecs rely on
motion priors that fail to capture the radiometric evolution of largely static
scenes. We introduce TerraCodec (TEC), a family of learned codecs tailored to
EO. TEC includes efficient image-based variants adapted to multispectral
inputs, as well as a Temporal Transformer model (TEC-TT) that leverages
dependencies across time. To overcome the fixed-rate setting of today's neural
codecs, we present Latent Repacking, a novel method for training flexible-rate
transformer models that operate on varying rate-distortion settings. Trained on
Sentinel-2 data, TerraCodec outperforms classical codecs, achieving 3-10x
stronger compression at equivalent image quality. Beyond compression, TEC-TT
enables zero-shot cloud inpainting, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the
AllClear benchmark. Our results establish bespoke, learned compression
algorithms as a promising direction for Earth observation. Code and model
weights will be released under a permissive license.

Conclusion: 所提出的多无人机协作占用预测框架有效解决了现有方法的局限性，在保持高精度的同时大幅降低了通信需求，为无人机群系统提供了高效的协作感知机制。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm systems necessitate efficient
collaborative perception mechanisms for diverse operational scenarios. Current
Bird's Eye View (BEV)-based approaches exhibit two main limitations:
bounding-box representations fail to capture complete semantic and geometric
information of the scene, and their performance significantly degrades when
encountering undefined or occluded objects. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel multi-UAV collaborative occupancy prediction framework. Our
framework effectively preserves 3D spatial structures and semantics through
integrating a Spatial-Aware Feature Encoder and Cross-Agent Feature
Integration. To enhance efficiency, we further introduce Altitude-Aware Feature
Reduction to compactly represent scene information, along with a Dual-Mask
Perceptual Guidance mechanism to adaptively select features and reduce
communication overhead. Due to the absence of suitable benchmark datasets, we
extend three datasets for evaluation: two virtual datasets (Air-to-Pred-Occ and
UAV3D-Occ) and one real-world dataset (GauUScene-Occ). Experiments results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly
outperforming existing collaborative methods while reducing communication
overhead to only a fraction of previous approaches.

Conclusion: EReLiFM通过证据可靠性感知和残差流匹配机制，有效解决了带噪声标签的开集域泛化问题，提升了模型在噪声环境下的泛化能力

Abstract: Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) aims to enable deep learning models to
recognize unseen categories in new domains, which is crucial for real-world
applications. Label noise hinders open-set domain generalization by corrupting
source-domain knowledge, making it harder to recognize known classes and reject
unseen ones. While existing methods address OSDG under Noisy Labels (OSDG-NL)
using hyperbolic prototype-guided meta-learning, they struggle to bridge domain
gaps, especially with limited clean labeled data. In this paper, we propose
Evidential Reliability-Aware Residual Flow Meta-Learning (EReLiFM). We first
introduce an unsupervised two-stage evidential loss clustering method to
promote label reliability awareness. Then, we propose a residual flow matching
mechanism that models structured domain- and category-conditioned residuals,
enabling diverse and uncertainty-aware transfer paths beyond
interpolation-based augmentation. During this meta-learning process, the model
is optimized such that the update direction on the clean set maximizes the loss
decrease on the noisy set, using pseudo labels derived from the most confident
predicted class for supervision. Experimental results show that EReLiFM
outperforms existing methods on OSDG-NL, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. The source code is available at

Motivation: Transformer模型在医学影像中易学习虚假相关性，导致偏见和泛化能力有限，而人工-AI注意力对齐需要昂贵的监督。

Method: 混合解释引导学习框架，包含自监督组件，利用类别区分性注意力而不依赖限制性先验。

Conclusion: H-EGL框架有效提升注意力对齐和模型泛化能力，无需昂贵的人工监督。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional
performance in medical imaging by leveraging attention mechanisms for feature
representation and interpretability. However, these models are prone to
learning spurious correlations, leading to biases and limited generalization.
While human-AI attention alignment can mitigate these issues, it often depends
on costly manual supervision. In this work, we propose a Hybrid
Explanation-Guided Learning (H-EGL) framework that combines self-supervised and
human-guided constraints to enhance attention alignment and improve
generalization. The self-supervised component of H-EGL leverages
class-distinctive attention without relying on restrictive priors, promoting
robustness and flexibility. We validate our approach on chest X-ray
classification using the Vision Transformer (ViT), where H-EGL outperforms two
state-of-the-art Explanation-Guided Learning (EGL) methods, demonstrating
superior classification accuracy and generalization capability. Additionally,
it produces attention maps that are better aligned with human expertise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要遵循"关于图像的思考"范式，将图像视为静态输入，而现实场景中需要模型能够主动操作图像并将其作为可操纵的认知工作空间。

Method: 引入IRIS基准，包含1,204个具有挑战性的开放视觉任务（603个单轮，601个多轮），涵盖5个不同领域，并配有详细评分标准。

Result: 当前MLLMs在需要有效整合视觉和通用工具的任务上表现困难，最强模型GPT-5-think仅达到18.68%通过率，不同模型在工具使用行为上存在差异。

Conclusion: IRIS作为首个专注于"与图像一起思考"的基准，为推进MLLMs的视觉智能提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in
real-world scenarios where user-provided images are often imperfect, requiring
active image manipulations such as cropping, editing, or enhancement to uncover
salient visual cues. Beyond static visual perception, MLLMs must also think
with images: dynamically transforming visual content and integrating it with
other tools to solve complex tasks. However, this shift from treating vision as
passive context to a manipulable cognitive workspace remains underexplored.
Most existing benchmarks still follow a think about images paradigm, where
images are regarded as static inputs. To address this gap, we introduce IRIS,
an Interactive Reasoning with Images and Systems that evaluates MLLMs' ability
to perceive, transform, and reason across complex visual-textual tasks under
the think with images paradigm. IRIS comprises 1,204 challenging, open-ended
vision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) spanning across five diverse
domains, each paired with detailed rubrics to enable systematic evaluation. Our
evaluation shows that current MLLMs struggle with tasks requiring effective
integration of vision and general-purpose tools. Even the strongest model
(GPT-5-think) reaches only 18.68% pass rate. We further observe divergent
tool-use behaviors, with OpenAI models benefiting from diverse image
manipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows no improvement. By introducing the
first benchmark centered on think with images, IRIS offers critical insights
for advancing visual intelligence in MLLMs.

TL;DR: 提出一种新的个性化联邦微调方法，通过正交LoRA适配器分离通用和客户端特定知识，使每个客户端能充分利用自身和其他客户端的数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在医疗AI中应用面临数据共享限制和隐私保护挑战，联邦学习可解决数据聚合问题，但需要更有效的个性化微调方法。

Method: 使用正交LoRA适配器来解耦通用知识和客户端特定知识，在联邦学习框架下进行个性化微调。

Result: 在真实世界联邦医学影像任务上的初步结果显示，该方法与当前联邦微调方法相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效解决医疗数据隐私保护下的模型微调问题，为联邦学习在医疗AI中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Foundation models open up new possibilities for the use of AI in healthcare.
However, even when pre-trained on health data, they still need to be fine-tuned
for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, although foundation models reduce
the amount of training data required to achieve good performance, obtaining
sufficient data is still a challenge. This is due, in part, to restrictions on
sharing and aggregating data from different sources to protect patients'
privacy. One possible solution to this is to fine-tune foundation models via
federated learning across multiple participating clients (i.e., hospitals,
clinics, etc.). In this work, we propose a new personalized federated
fine-tuning method that learns orthogonal LoRA adapters to disentangle general
and client-specific knowledge, enabling each client to fully exploit both their
own data and the data of others. Our preliminary results on real-world
federated medical imaging tasks demonstrate that our approach is competitive
against current federated fine-tuning methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashVSR是首个基于扩散模型的单步流式实时视频超分辨率框架，通过三阶段蒸馏、局部约束稀疏注意力和微型条件解码器实现高效处理，在A100 GPU上达到约17 FPS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的视频超分辨率方法存在高延迟、计算量大和对超高分辨率泛化能力差的问题，需要实现高效、可扩展且实时的解决方案。

Method: 提出三阶段蒸馏管道实现流式超分辨率，使用局部约束稀疏注意力减少冗余计算并弥合训练-测试分辨率差距，采用微型条件解码器加速重建而不牺牲质量。

Result: FlashVSR在768x1408视频上达到约17 FPS，比先前单步扩散VSR模型快12倍，在超高分辨率下可靠扩展并实现最先进性能。

Conclusion: FlashVSR使基于扩散模型的视频超分辨率变得实用，通过效率、可扩展性和实时性能的平衡，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video restoration, but applying them
to real-world video super-resolution (VSR) remains challenging due to high
latency, prohibitive computation, and poor generalization to ultra-high
resolutions. Our goal in this work is to make diffusion-based VSR practical by
achieving efficiency, scalability, and real-time performance. To this end, we
propose FlashVSR, the first diffusion-based one-step streaming framework
towards real-time VSR. FlashVSR runs at approximately 17 FPS for 768x1408
videos on a single A100 GPU by combining three complementary innovations: (i) a
train-friendly three-stage distillation pipeline that enables streaming
super-resolution, (ii) locality-constrained sparse attention that cuts
redundant computation while bridging the train-test resolution gap, and (iii) a
tiny conditional decoder that accelerates reconstruction without sacrificing
quality. To support large-scale training, we also construct VSR-120K, a new
dataset with 120k videos and 180k images. Extensive experiments show that
FlashVSR scales reliably to ultra-high resolutions and achieves
state-of-the-art performance with up to 12x speedup over prior one-step
diffusion VSR models. We will release the code, pretrained models, and dataset
to foster future research in efficient diffusion-based VSR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPORTS框架通过整合视频全景分割、视觉里程计和场景渲染任务，解决现有方法在分割缺陷、动态物体干扰、数据稀疏性和视角限制方面的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有场景感知方法存在分割缺陷、动态物体干扰、传感器数据稀疏和视角限制等问题，需要更全面的解决方案。

Method: 提出SPORTS框架，包含三个核心组件：1) VPS使用自适应注意力几何融合机制对齐跨帧特征；2) VO结合全景分割结果和光流图改进动态物体置信度估计；3) SR通过点云渲染生成神经场来合成高保真视图。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法在里程计、跟踪、分割和新视角合成任务上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SPORTS框架通过紧密集成多个任务，实现了更全面的场景理解，在多个关键任务上取得了优异性能。

Abstract: The scene perception, understanding, and simulation are fundamental
techniques for embodied-AI agents, while existing solutions are still prone to
segmentation deficiency, dynamic objects' interference, sensor data sparsity,
and view-limitation problems. This paper proposes a novel framework, named
SPORTS, for holistic scene understanding via tightly integrating Video Panoptic
Segmentation (VPS), Visual Odometry (VO), and Scene Rendering (SR) tasks into
an iterative and unified perspective. Firstly, VPS designs an adaptive
attention-based geometric fusion mechanism to align cross-frame features via
enrolling the pose, depth, and optical flow modality, which automatically
adjust feature maps for different decoding stages. And a post-matching strategy
is integrated to improve identities tracking. In VO, panoptic segmentation
results from VPS are combined with the optical flow map to improve the
confidence estimation of dynamic objects, which enhances the accuracy of the
camera pose estimation and completeness of the depth map generation via the
learning-based paradigm. Furthermore, the point-based rendering of SR is
beneficial from VO, transforming sparse point clouds into neural fields to
synthesize high-fidelity RGB views and twin panoptic views. Extensive
experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our attention-based
feature fusion outperforms most existing state-of-the-art methods on the
odometry, tracking, segmentation, and novel view synthesis tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了VQArt-Bench，一个针对文化遗产领域的大规模视觉问答基准，通过多智能体管道生成多样化问题，评估多模态大语言模型在视觉艺术分析中的深度语义理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA基准在评估深度语义理解方面存在不足，特别是在视觉艺术分析等复杂领域，问题局限于简单句法结构和表面属性，无法捕捉人类视觉查询的多样性和深度。

Method: 使用新颖的多智能体管道，让专门化智能体协作生成经过验证的、语言多样化的细微问题，基准结构围绕相关视觉理解维度设计。

Result: 对14个最先进MLLM的评估揭示了当前模型的显著局限性，包括在简单计数任务中的意外弱点，以及专有模型与开源模型之间的明显性能差距。

Conclusion: VQArt-Bench填补了现有基准的空白，能够更有效地评估模型在复杂视觉理解任务中的能力，揭示了当前多模态模型在深度语义理解方面的不足。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
capabilities in joint visual and linguistic tasks. However, existing Visual
Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks often fail to evaluate deep semantic
understanding, particularly in complex domains like visual art analysis.
Confined to simple syntactic structures and surface-level attributes, these
questions fail to capture the diversity and depth of human visual inquiry. This
limitation incentivizes models to exploit statistical shortcuts rather than
engage in visual reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce VQArt-Bench, a
new, large-scale VQA benchmark for the cultural heritage domain. This benchmark
is constructed using a novel multi-agent pipeline where specialized agents
collaborate to generate nuanced, validated, and linguistically diverse
questions. The resulting benchmark is structured along relevant visual
understanding dimensions that probe a model's ability to interpret symbolic
meaning, narratives, and complex visual relationships. Our evaluation of 14
state-of-the-art MLLMs on this benchmark reveals significant limitations in
current models, including a surprising weakness in simple counting tasks and a
clear performance gap between proprietary and open-source models.

*Wenpu Li,Bangyan Liao,Yi Zhou,Qi Xu,Pian Wan,Peidong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督框架E-MoFlow，通过隐式时空和几何正则化联合优化自运动和光流估计，避免了显式深度估计，在6-DoF运动场景中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在神经形态视觉（如事件相机）中，光流和6-DoF自运动估计通常独立处理，但由于缺乏鲁棒的数据关联，单独解决这两个问题是一个不适定挑战。现有方法要么引入变分正则化导致结果偏差和计算开销，要么通过参数化收敛到次优局部最小值。

Method: 将相机自运动建模为连续样条，光流建模为隐式神经表示，通过归纳偏置嵌入时空一致性；结合微分几何约束引入结构和运动先验，绕过显式深度估计但保持几何一致性。

Result: 实验表明该方法适用于一般6-DoF运动场景，在无监督方法中达到最先进性能，甚至与有监督方法竞争。

Conclusion: E-MoFlow框架通过隐式正则化在完全无监督范式下统一了自运动和光流估计，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: The estimation of optical flow and 6-DoF ego-motion, two fundamental tasks in
3D vision, has typically been addressed independently. For neuromorphic vision
(e.g., event cameras), however, the lack of robust data association makes
solving the two problems separately an ill-posed challenge, especially in the
absence of supervision via ground truth. Existing works mitigate this
ill-posedness by either enforcing the smoothness of the flow field via an
explicit variational regularizer or leveraging explicit structure-and-motion
priors in the parametrization to improve event alignment. The former notably
introduces bias in results and computational overhead, while the latter, which
parametrizes the optical flow in terms of the scene depth and the camera
motion, often converges to suboptimal local minima. To address these issues, we
propose an unsupervised framework that jointly optimizes egomotion and optical
flow via implicit spatial-temporal and geometric regularization. First, by
modeling camera's egomotion as a continuous spline and optical flow as an
implicit neural representation, our method inherently embeds spatial-temporal
coherence through inductive biases. Second, we incorporate structure-and-motion
priors through differential geometric constraints, bypassing explicit depth
estimation while maintaining rigorous geometric consistency. As a result, our
framework (called E-MoFlow) unifies egomotion and optical flow estimation via
implicit regularization under a fully unsupervised paradigm. Experiments
demonstrate its versatility to general 6-DoF motion scenarios, achieving
state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods and competitive even
with supervised approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SRUM是一个自奖励后训练框架，通过让统一多模态模型的理解模块评估和奖励生成模块，实现自我改进，无需额外人工标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统一多模态模型存在视觉理解能力无法有效迁移到视觉生成的问题，模型能正确理解图像但无法从文本提示生成忠实图像。

Method: 设计了全局-局部双重奖励系统：全局奖励确保整体视觉语义和布局正确性，局部奖励优化细粒度对象级保真度。

Result: 在T2I-CompBench上性能从82.18提升到88.37，在T2I-ReasonBench上从43.82提升到46.75。

Conclusion: 建立了一个新范式，使统一多模态模型的理解模块能够通过自奖励来指导和增强其自身的生成能力。

Abstract: Recently, remarkable progress has been made in Unified Multimodal Models
(UMMs), which integrate vision-language generation and understanding
capabilities within a single framework. However, a significant gap exists where
a model's strong visual understanding often fails to transfer to its visual
generation. A model might correctly understand an image based on user
instructions, yet be unable to generate a faithful image from text prompts.
This phenomenon directly raises a compelling question: Can a model achieve
self-improvement by using its understanding module to reward its generation
module? To bridge this gap and achieve self-improvement, we introduce SRUM, a
self-rewarding post-training framework that can be directly applied to existing
UMMs of various designs. SRUM creates a feedback loop where the model's own
understanding module acts as an internal ``evaluator'', providing corrective
signals to improve its generation module, without requiring additional
human-labeled data. To ensure this feedback is comprehensive, we designed a
global-local dual reward system. To tackle the inherent structural complexity
of images, this system offers multi-scale guidance: a \textbf{global reward}
ensures the correctness of the overall visual semantics and layout, while a
\textbf{local reward} refines fine-grained, object-level fidelity. SRUM leads
to powerful capabilities and shows strong generalization, boosting performance
on T2I-CompBench from 82.18 to \textbf{88.37} and on T2I-ReasonBench from 43.82
to \textbf{46.75}. Overall, our work establishes a powerful new paradigm for
enabling a UMMs' understanding module to guide and enhance its own generation
via self-rewarding.

TL;DR: 提出基于深度学习和交叉注意力的头部运动校正方法DL-HMC++，从1秒3D PET原始数据预测刚性头部运动，无需硬件运动跟踪设备，在多个PET扫描仪和放射性示踪剂上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 头部运动是脑PET成像中的主要挑战，会导致图像伪影和示踪剂摄取定量不准确。硬件运动跟踪在临床实践中适用性有限，需要开发数据驱动的运动校正方法。

Method: 使用深度学习结合交叉注意力机制，从1秒3D PET原始数据预测刚性头部运动。通过监督学习利用现有动态PET扫描和外部硬件运动跟踪的金标准运动测量数据进行训练。

Result: 在两个PET扫描仪和四种放射性示踪剂上验证，DL-HMC++优于现有数据驱动运动估计方法，产生的无运动图像与金标准硬件运动跟踪结果难以区分。HRRT和mCT扫描仪的标准摄取值差异比分别为1.2±0.5%和0.5±0.2%。

Conclusion: DL-HMC++展示了数据驱动PET头部运动校正的潜力，可消除对硬件运动跟踪的依赖，使运动校正技术能够在临床环境中广泛应用。

Abstract: Head movement poses a significant challenge in brain positron emission
tomography (PET) imaging, resulting in image artifacts and tracer uptake
quantification inaccuracies. Effective head motion estimation and correction
are crucial for precise quantitative image analysis and accurate diagnosis of
neurological disorders. Hardware-based motion tracking (HMT) has limited
applicability in real-world clinical practice. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a deep-learning head motion correction approach with cross-attention
(DL-HMC++) to predict rigid head motion from one-second 3D PET raw data.
DL-HMC++ is trained in a supervised manner by leveraging existing dynamic PET
scans with gold-standard motion measurements from external HMT. We evaluate
DL-HMC++ on two PET scanners (HRRT and mCT) and four radiotracers (18F-FDG,
18F-FPEB, 11C-UCB-J, and 11C-LSN3172176) to demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of the approach in large cohort PET studies. Quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that DL-HMC++ consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art data-driven motion estimation methods, producing motion-free
images with clear delineation of brain structures and reduced motion artifacts
that are indistinguishable from gold-standard HMT. Brain region of interest
standard uptake value analysis exhibits average difference ratios between
DL-HMC++ and gold-standard HMT to be 1.2 plus-minus 0.5% for HRRT and 0.5
plus-minus 0.2% for mCT. DL-HMC++ demonstrates the potential for data-driven
PET head motion correction to remove the burden of HMT, making motion
correction accessible to clinical populations beyond research settings. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于学习的特征上采样方法（如DINO或CLIP）需要为每个特征提取器重新训练，无法在推理时泛化到不同的特征类型。

Method: 提出了一种推理时特征无关的上采样架构，无需编码器特定训练，可应用于各种特征类型。

Result: AnyUp在特征上采样方面达到了新的最先进水平，能够泛化到不同的特征类型，保持特征语义，且高效易用于各种下游任务。

Conclusion: AnyUp提供了一种通用、高效的特征上采样解决方案，显著提升了特征上采样质量和泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce AnyUp, a method for feature upsampling that can be applied to
any vision feature at any resolution, without encoder-specific training.
Existing learning-based upsamplers for features like DINO or CLIP need to be
re-trained for every feature extractor and thus do not generalize to different
feature types at inference time. In this work, we propose an inference-time
feature-agnostic upsampling architecture to alleviate this limitation and
improve upsampling quality. In our experiments, AnyUp sets a new state of the
art for upsampled features, generalizes to different feature types, and
preserves feature semantics while being efficient and easy to apply to a wide
range of downstream tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study and benchmark on Efficient
Perceptual Super-Resolution (EPSR). While significant progress has been made in
efficient PSNR-oriented super resolution, approaches focusing on perceptual
quality metrics remain relatively inefficient. Motivated by this gap, we aim to
replicate or improve the perceptual results of Real-ESRGAN while meeting strict
efficiency constraints: a maximum of 5M parameters and 2000 GFLOPs, calculated
for an input size of 960x540 pixels. The proposed solutions were evaluated on a
novel dataset consisting of 500 test images of 4K resolution, each degraded
using multiple degradation types, without providing the original high-quality
counterparts. This design aims to reflect realistic deployment conditions and
serves as a diverse and challenging benchmark. The top-performing approach
manages to outperform Real-ESRGAN across all benchmark datasets, demonstrating
the potential of efficient methods in the perceptual domain. This paper
establishes the modern baselines for efficient perceptual super resolution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: USplat4D是一个不确定性感知的动态高斯泼溅框架，通过建模每个高斯基元的时间变化不确定性来提升4D重建质量，解决了遮挡下的运动漂移和极端视角合成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的动态高斯泼溅模型对所有高斯基元进行均匀优化，忽略了它们在视图和时间中的可见性差异，导致在遮挡情况下出现运动漂移，以及在未见视角下合成质量下降。

Method: 提出估计每个高斯基元的时间变化不确定性，并利用这些不确定性构建时空图进行不确定性感知优化，将可靠的运动线索传播到整个场景。

Result: 在多个真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，显式建模不确定性能够持续改进动态高斯泼溅模型，在遮挡下产生更稳定的几何结构，并在极端视角下实现高质量的合成。

Conclusion: 不确定性建模对于动态高斯泼溅至关重要，USplat4D通过不确定性感知优化有效提升了4D重建的稳定性和合成质量。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular input is fundamentally
under-constrained, with ambiguities arising from occlusion and extreme novel
views. While dynamic Gaussian Splatting offers an efficient representation,
vanilla models optimize all Gaussian primitives uniformly, ignoring whether
they are well or poorly observed. This limitation leads to motion drifts under
occlusion and degraded synthesis when extrapolating to unseen views. We argue
that uncertainty matters: Gaussians with recurring observations across views
and time act as reliable anchors to guide motion, whereas those with limited
visibility are treated as less reliable. To this end, we introduce USplat4D, a
novel Uncertainty-aware dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework that propagates
reliable motion cues to enhance 4D reconstruction. Our key insight is to
estimate time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and leverages it to construct a
spatio-temporal graph for uncertainty-aware optimization. Experiments on
diverse real and synthetic datasets show that explicitly modeling uncertainty
consistently improves dynamic Gaussian Splatting models, yielding more stable
geometry under occlusion and high-quality synthesis at extreme viewpoints.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Flow Poke Transformer (FPT)框架，能够基于稀疏交互直接预测局部运动分布，相比传统方法提供可解释的多模态场景运动表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解物理场景动态需要推理其潜在变化方式，特别是局部交互产生的影响。传统方法通常只能密集采样单一动态实现，缺乏对多模态运动及其不确定性的直接表示。

Method: 使用Flow Poke Transformer框架，基于稀疏交互（称为"pokes"）直接预测局部运动分布，提供可解释的多模态场景运动表示。

Result: 在密集面部运动生成任务中，通用预训练模型超越专用基线；在强分布外任务中微调后，在关节物体运动估计上显著优于域内方法；在基于pokes的运动部件分割任务中达到竞争性能。

Conclusion: FPT框架通过直接预测显式运动分布，展示了在多种下游任务中的灵活性和有效性，为场景动态理解提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of a physical scene involves reasoning about the
diverse ways it can potentially change, especially as a result of local
interactions. We present the Flow Poke Transformer (FPT), a novel framework for
directly predicting the distribution of local motion, conditioned on sparse
interactions termed "pokes". Unlike traditional methods that typically only
enable dense sampling of a single realization of scene dynamics, FPT provides
an interpretable directly accessible representation of multi-modal scene
motion, its dependency on physical interactions and the inherent uncertainties
of scene dynamics. We also evaluate our model on several downstream tasks to
enable comparisons with prior methods and highlight the flexibility of our
approach. On dense face motion generation, our generic pre-trained model
surpasses specialized baselines. FPT can be fine-tuned in strongly
out-of-distribution tasks such as synthetic datasets to enable significant
improvements over in-domain methods in articulated object motion estimation.
Additionally, predicting explicit motion distributions directly enables our
method to achieve competitive performance on tasks like moving part
segmentation from pokes which further demonstrates the versatility of our FPT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统创建逼真人类虚拟形象的过程昂贵耗时，而现有单图生成方法在视角偏离参考图像时质量会下降，缺乏多视角信息和明确3D表示的约束。

Method: 基于预训练视频扩散模型，同时生成数百帧从不同视角（最多360度）的视频，并将输出蒸馏成可实时渲染的4D虚拟形象。

Result: 相比先前方法，显著提升了生成虚拟形象的逼真度、时间一致性和3D一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法降低了虚拟形象创建门槛，实现了从单张图像生成高质量多视角动画化虚拟形象的能力。

Abstract: Digital human avatars aim to simulate the dynamic appearance of humans in
virtual environments, enabling immersive experiences across gaming, film,
virtual reality, and more. However, the conventional process for creating and
animating photorealistic human avatars is expensive and time-consuming,
requiring large camera capture rigs and significant manual effort from
professional 3D artists. With the advent of capable image and video generation
models, recent methods enable automatic rendering of realistic animated avatars
from a single casually captured reference image of a target subject. While
these techniques significantly lower barriers to avatar creation and offer
compelling realism, they lack constraints provided by multi-view information or
an explicit 3D representation. So, image quality and realism degrade when
rendered from viewpoints that deviate strongly from the reference image. Here,
we build a video model that generates animatable multi-view videos of digital
humans based on a single reference image and target expressions. Our model,
MVP4D, is based on a state-of-the-art pre-trained video diffusion model and
generates hundreds of frames simultaneously from viewpoints varying by up to
360 degrees around a target subject. We show how to distill the outputs of this
model into a 4D avatar that can be rendered in real-time. Our approach
significantly improves the realism, temporal consistency, and 3D consistency of
generated avatars compared to previous methods.

Method: 提出Layerwise Attention Pooling机制从冻结VLM中提取多层级信息；开发VERIFI方法，在模型内提示重写时仅使用VLM生成的文本token来条件化扩散变换器；通过编辑任务微调实现跨模态知识迁移。

Result: LAP在文本-图像对齐方面优于其他浅层融合架构；编辑任务微调不仅提高了生成的对齐度，还展现出强大的泛化能力；在单图像编辑训练后能零样本泛化到多图像参考。

Conclusion: UniFusion的统一编码器设计证明了跨模态知识迁移的有效性，为生成模型提供了更强的推理能力和灵活性。

Abstract: Although recent advances in visual generation have been remarkable, most
existing architectures still depend on distinct encoders for images and text.
This separation constrains diffusion models' ability to perform cross-modal
reasoning and knowledge transfer. Prior attempts to bridge this gap often use
the last layer information from VLM, employ multiple visual encoders, or train
large unified models jointly for text and image generation, which demands
substantial computational resources and large-scale data, limiting its
accessibility.We present UniFusion, a diffusion-based generative model
conditioned on a frozen large vision-language model (VLM) that serves as a
unified multimodal encoder. At the core of UniFusion is the Layerwise Attention
Pooling (LAP) mechanism that extracts both high level semantics and low level
details from text and visual tokens of a frozen VLM to condition a diffusion
generative model. We demonstrate that LAP outperforms other shallow fusion
architectures on text-image alignment for generation and faithful transfer of
visual information from VLM to the diffusion model which is key for editing. We
propose VLM-Enabled Rewriting Injection with Flexibile Inference (VERIFI),
which conditions a diffusion transformer (DiT) only on the text tokens
generated by the VLM during in-model prompt rewriting. VERIFI combines the
alignment of the conditioning distribution with the VLM's reasoning
capabilities for increased capabilities and flexibility at inference. In
addition, finetuning on editing task not only improves text-image alignment for
generation, indicative of cross-modality knowledge transfer, but also exhibits
tremendous generalization capabilities. Our model when trained on single image
editing, zero-shot generalizes to multiple image references further motivating
the unified encoder design of UniFusion.

TL;DR: 提出ViCO方法，通过视觉一致性学习让模型根据图像语义复杂度动态调整视觉token数量，减少推理成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型由于图像输入引入的额外视觉token导致推理成本增加

Method: 使用多个不同压缩率的MLP连接器对视觉token进行下采样，训练时最小化不同MLP连接器条件响应的KL散度，推理时通过视觉分辨率路由器自动选择每个图像块的最佳压缩率

Result: 实验结果表明该方法可将视觉token数量减少高达50%，同时保持模型的感知、推理和OCR能力

Conclusion: 这项工作有助于开发更高效的多模态大语言模型

Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from increased
inference costs due to the additional vision tokens introduced by image inputs.
In this work, we propose Visual Consistency Learning (ViCO), a novel training
algorithm that enables the model to represent images of varying semantic
complexities using different numbers of vision tokens. The key idea behind our
method is to employ multiple MLP connectors, each with a different image
compression ratio, to downsample the vision tokens based on the semantic
complexity of the image. During training, we minimize the KL divergence between
the responses conditioned on different MLP connectors. At inference time, we
introduce an image router, termed Visual Resolution Router (ViR), that
automatically selects the appropriate compression rate for each image patch.
Compared with existing dynamic high-resolution strategies, which adjust the
number of visual tokens based on image resolutions, our method dynamically
adapts the number of visual tokens according to semantic complexity.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the number of
vision tokens by up to 50% while maintaining the model's perception, reasoning,
and OCR capabilities. We hope this work will contribute to the development of
more efficient MLLMs. The code and models will be released to facilitate future
research.

TL;DR: CuMPerLay是一个可微分的向量化层，将立方多参数持久性(CMP)集成到深度学习管道中，通过分解CMP为可学习的单参数持久性，在医学影像和计算机视觉任务中提升分类和分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 立方多参数持久性(CMP)为图像拓扑分析提供了强大工具，但由于多过滤结构的复杂性和CMP向量化的困难，其应用受到限制。

Method: 提出新算法向量化立方复形的多参数同调，将CMP分解为可学习的单参数持久性组合，双过滤函数联合学习，具有可微性。

Result: 在基准医学影像和计算机视觉数据集上，CuMPerLay提升了分类和分割性能，特别是在数据有限的情况下表现更佳。

Conclusion: CuMPerLay为将全局结构信息集成到深度网络中提供了有前景的方向，适用于结构化图像分析。

Abstract: We present CuMPerLay, a novel differentiable vectorization layer that enables
the integration of Cubical Multiparameter Persistence (CMP) into deep learning
pipelines. While CMP presents a natural and powerful way to topologically work
with images, its use is hindered by the complexity of multifiltration
structures as well as the vectorization of CMP. In face of these challenges, we
introduce a new algorithm for vectorizing MP homologies of cubical complexes.
Our CuMPerLay decomposes the CMP into a combination of individual, learnable
single-parameter persistence, where the bifiltration functions are jointly
learned. Thanks to the differentiability, its robust topological feature
vectors can be seamlessly used within state-of-the-art architectures such as
Swin Transformers. We establish theoretical guarantees for the stability of our
vectorization under generalized Wasserstein metrics. Our experiments on
benchmark medical imaging and computer vision datasets show the benefit
CuMPerLay on classification and segmentation performance, particularly in
limited-data scenarios. Overall, CuMPerLay offers a promising direction for
integrating global structural information into deep networks for structured
image analysis.

TL;DR: DriveVLA-W0通过世界建模预测未来图像来解决VLA模型的监督不足问题，使用自回归和扩散两种世界模型架构，并引入轻量级动作专家降低推理延迟，在多个基准测试中显著优于BEV和VLA基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Vision-Language-Action (VLA) 模型中的“监督不足”问题，即模型的大容量仅由稀疏、低维度的动作监督，导致表示能力未充分利用。

Method: 提出DriveVLA-W0训练范式，使用世界建模预测未来图像，为模型提供密集的自监督信号；针对两种主要VLA架构分别使用自回归世界模型（离散视觉标记）和扩散世界模型（连续视觉特征）；引入轻量级动作专家解决实时部署的推理延迟问题。

Result: 在NAVSIM v1/v2基准测试和680倍更大的内部数据集上，DriveVLA-W0显著优于BEV和VLA基线；增强了数据缩放定律，显示随着训练数据集增大，性能提升加速。

Conclusion: 世界建模是解决VLA模型监督不足的有效方法，能够充分利用模型表示能力，DriveVLA-W0在自动驾驶任务中表现出色且具有良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on large-scale data offers a
promising path to achieving a more generalized driving intelligence. However,
VLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is
supervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their
representational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose
\textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to
predict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that
compels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment.
We showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA
archetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual
tokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual
features. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we
introduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for
real-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a
680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly
outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling
law, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size
increases.

TL;DR: Rex-Omni是一个3B规模的MLLM，通过特殊令牌表示量化坐标、多数据引擎生成高质量数据以及两阶段训练流程，在零样本设置下实现了与回归模型相当的目标检测性能，并具备多种视觉感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有MLLM在目标检测任务中面临的召回率低、重复预测、坐标不对齐等问题，弥合传统回归模型与MLLM之间的性能差距。

Method: 1）使用特殊令牌表示0-999的量化坐标；2）构建多个数据引擎生成高质量数据；3）采用两阶段训练：2200万数据的监督微调+基于GRPO的强化学习后训练。

Result: 在COCO和LVIS基准测试中，Rex-Omni在零样本设置下达到或超过回归模型（如DINO、Grounding DINO）的性能，并具备对象引用、指向、视觉提示等多种能力。

Conclusion: Rex-Omni为更通用和语言感知的视觉感知系统铺平了道路，展示了MLLM在目标检测任务中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Object detection has long been dominated by traditional coordinate
regression-based models, such as YOLO, DETR, and Grounding DINO. Although
recent efforts have attempted to leverage MLLMs to tackle this task, they face
challenges like low recall rate, duplicate predictions, coordinate
misalignment, etc. In this work, we bridge this gap and propose Rex-Omni, a
3B-scale MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art object perception performance. On
benchmarks like COCO and LVIS, Rex-Omni attains performance comparable to or
exceeding regression-based models (e.g., DINO, Grounding DINO) in a zero-shot
setting. This is enabled by three key designs: 1) Task Formulation: we use
special tokens to represent quantized coordinates from 0 to 999, reducing the
model's learning difficulty and improving token efficiency for coordinate
prediction; 2) Data Engines: we construct multiple data engines to generate
high-quality grounding, referring, and pointing data, providing semantically
rich supervision for training; \3) Training Pipelines: we employ a two-stage
training process, combining supervised fine-tuning on 22 million data with
GRPO-based reinforcement post-training. This RL post-training leverages
geometry-aware rewards to effectively bridge the discrete-to-continuous
coordinate prediction gap, improve box accuracy, and mitigate undesirable
behaviors like duplicate predictions that stem from the teacher-guided nature
of the initial SFT stage. Beyond conventional detection, Rex-Omni's inherent
language understanding enables versatile capabilities such as object referring,
pointing, visual prompting, GUI grounding, spatial referring, OCR and
key-pointing, all systematically evaluated on dedicated benchmarks. We believe
that Rex-Omni paves the way for more versatile and language-aware visual
perception systems.

TL;DR: DeepMMSearch-R1是首个能够按需进行多轮网页搜索的多模态大语言模型，能够动态构建图像和文本搜索查询，通过两阶段训练在知识密集型任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在流程僵化、搜索调用过多、查询构建不佳等问题，导致效率低下和结果不理想。需要开发能够动态适应真实世界变化信息的多模态模型。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：冷启动监督微调阶段和在线强化学习优化。创建了DeepMMSearchVQA数据集，包含多样化的多跳查询，教导模型何时搜索、搜索什么、使用哪个搜索工具以及如何对检索信息进行推理。

Result: 在多个知识密集型基准测试中进行了广泛实验，证明了该方法在知识密集型任务中的优越性。

Conclusion: 该研究为推进多模态网络搜索提供了有价值的见解，展示了动态查询构建和迭代搜索策略的有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world applications require
access to external knowledge sources and must remain responsive to the dynamic
and ever-changing real-world information in order to address
information-seeking and knowledge-intensive user queries. Existing approaches,
such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods, search agents, and search
equipped MLLMs, often suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and
poorly constructed search queries, which result in inefficiencies and
suboptimal outcomes. To address these limitations, we present DeepMMSearch-R1,
the first multimodal LLM capable of performing on-demand, multi-turn web
searches and dynamically crafting queries for both image and text search tools.
Specifically, DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant crops
of the input image making the image search more effective, and can iteratively
adapt text search queries based on retrieved information, thereby enabling
self-reflection and self-correction. Our approach relies on a two-stage
training pipeline: a cold start supervised finetuning phase followed by an
online reinforcement learning optimization. For training, we introduce
DeepMMSearchVQA, a novel multimodal VQA dataset created through an automated
pipeline intermixed with real-world information from web search tools. This
dataset contains diverse, multi-hop queries that integrate textual and visual
information, teaching the model when to search, what to search for, which
search tool to use and how to reason over the retrieved information. We conduct
extensive experiments across a range of knowledge-intensive benchmarks to
demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Finally, we analyze the results
and provide insights that are valuable for advancing multimodal web-search.

TL;DR: LLMs在逻辑谜题中表现出记忆模板而非真实推理的脆弱性，PHANTOM RECALL基准测试显示模型在扰动谜题中性能显著下降，存在幻影回忆和过度阐述问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs是否真正具备推理能力，还是仅仅依赖记忆模板，以及如何系统评估和改进它们在逻辑推理方面的表现。

Method: 引入PHANTOM RECALL基准，包含25个经典逻辑谜题和149个扰动版本，评估11个主流LLM，并开发自动化逻辑等价判断、细粒度错误分类和提示缓解框架。

Result: 模型在原始谜题上表现接近完美，但在扰动版本中显著低于人类水平，出现幻影回忆和过度阐述等错误模式。

Conclusion: LLMs在上下文线索变化时往往无法重新推理，揭示了语言流畅性与逻辑理解之间的关键差距。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, Gemini, and Claude often appear
adept at solving classic logic puzzles--but how much genuine reasoning
underlies their answers? Recent evidence suggests that these models frequently
rely on memorized templates rather than reasoning from first principles. When
puzzles are slightly modified, their performance collapses, revealing a
striking fragility. In particular, we asked: Have LLMs addressed these issues?
To what extent? How about perturbations to other puzzles? Is there a general
way of reformulating the prompt so that the models do better? To examine these
things systematically, we introduce PHANTOM RECALL, a benchmark comprising 25
well-known logic puzzles and 149 carefully designed perturbations that preserve
reasoning structure but alter superficial details and solutions. We evaluate
eleven leading LLMs and identify a recurring failure mode--phantom
recall--where models confidently reproduce memorized solutions or spurious
rationales that no longer fit the altered scenario. To probe and mitigate this
issue, we contribute three tools: (i) an automated logical-equivalence judge to
detect reasoning mismatches, (ii) a taxonomy of fine-grained reasoning error
categories, and (iii) a prompting-based mitigation framework guided by these
categories. Despite near-perfect accuracy on unmodified puzzles, models
significantly underperform humans on perturbed ones, exhibiting both phantom
recall and over-elaboration. Our findings reveal a crucial limitation: LLMs
often fail to re-reason when contextual cues shift--highlighting the gap
between linguistic fluency and logical understanding.

Motivation: 探索LLMs是否适合作为世界模型，解决其在长时程模拟中因幻觉和静态知识导致的复合错误问题。

Method: 通过三个任务评估LLMs的世界建模能力：下一状态识别、完整程序规划对齐和里程碑转换识别。提出R-WoM模型，通过检索外部教程知识来增强LLM模拟。

Result: LLMs能有效捕捉即时下一状态和有意义的转换，但在完整程序规划中性能迅速下降。R-WoM在OSWorld和WebArena上分别提升25.3%和18.1%，在长时程模拟中优势明显。

Conclusion: LLMs在长时程世界建模方面存在局限性，而检索增强的R-WoM能显著提升模拟性能，特别是在复杂的长时程任务中。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as world models to enhance agent
decision-making in digital environments by simulating future states and
predicting action outcomes, potentially eliminating costly trial-and-error
exploration. However, this capability is fundamentally limited by LLMs'
tendency toward hallucination and their reliance on static training knowledge,
which can lead to compounding errors that inhibit long-horizon simulations. To
systematically investigate whether LLMs are appropriate for world modeling, we
probe two core capabilities of world models--future state prediction and reward
estimation--through three tasks: next-state identification, full-procedure
planning alignment, and milestone transition recognition. Our analysis shows
that while LLMs effectively capture immediate next states and identify
meaningful state transitions, their performance rapidly degrades in
full-procedure planning. This highlights LLMs' limitations in reliably modeling
environment dynamics over long horizons. To address these limitations, we
propose the Retrieval-augmented World Model (R-WoM), which grounds LLM
simulations by incorporating factual, up-to-date knowledge retrieved from
external tutorials. Experiments show that R-WoM achieves substantial
improvements of up to 25.3% (OSWorld) and 18.1% (WebArena) compared to
baselines, with particular advantages in longer-horizon simulations.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs对输入变化的敏感性源于其内部知识表示的不稳定性。通过语义保持的扰动测试，发现当样本与预训练数据差异增大时，LLMs区分真假陈述的能力会显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs性能脆弱性的根本原因，验证是否由于内部知识表示的不稳定性导致模型对输入微小变化过度敏感。

Method: 应用语义保持的扰动（如拼写错误、重新表述）将样本推向分布外，在四个LLM家族、五个评估数据集和三种知识探测方法上测试表示可分性的退化情况。

Result: 当样本呈现与预训练数据相似度降低时，LLMs内部对陈述真实性的表示会崩溃。模型区分真假陈述的能力高度依赖于陈述的确切表面形式。

Conclusion: LLMs可能学习了浅层、非鲁棒的知识表示，限制了泛化能力。这对真实性探测的实用性提出了根本挑战，需要进一步研究改进学习知识表示的鲁棒性。

Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs) to be reliable, they must learn robust
knowledge that can be generally applied in diverse settings -- often unlike
those seen during training. Yet, extensive research has shown that LLM
performance can be brittle, with models exhibiting excessive sensitivity to
trivial input variations. In this work, we explore whether this brittleness is
a direct result of unstable internal knowledge representations. To explore this
question, we build on previous work showing that LLM representations encode
statement truthfulness -- i.e., true, factual statements can be easily
separated from false, inaccurate ones. Specifically, we test the robustness of
learned knowledge by evaluating representation separability on samples that
have undergone superficial transformations to drive them out-of-distribution
(OOD), such as typos or reformulations. By applying semantically-preserving
perturbations, we study how separability degrades as statements become more
OOD, across four LLM families, five evaluation datasets, and three knowledge
probing methods. Our results reveal that internal representations of statement
truthfulness collapse as the samples' presentations become less similar to
those seen during pre-training. While LLMs can often distinguish between true
and false statements when they closely resemble the pre-training data, this
ability is highly dependent on the statement's exact surface form. These
findings offer a possible explanation for brittle benchmark performance: LLMs
may learn shallow, non-robust knowledge representations that allow for only
limited generalizability. Our work presents a fundamental challenge for the
utility of truthfulness probes, and more broadly, calls for further research on
improving the robustness of learned knowledge representations.

Motivation: 探索大型推理模型在机器翻译任务中生成中间思考过程的价值，特别是在不同资源水平的语言对中。

Method: 使用蒸馏思维链方法，通过人工翻译实践启发，生成逐步翻译的合成解释来微调模型。同时尝试模块化翻译策略构建中间标记。

Result: 思考标记不能帮助LRMs更好地执行机器翻译，标准输入输出微调优于思维链微调。但模块化翻译策略构建的中间标记能带来改进。

Conclusion: 微调过程中中间标记的贡献高度依赖于其中是否包含翻译尝试，使用教师模型改进目标翻译或扩展平行语料比蒸馏思维链解释更有效。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have led to new possibilities in terms of
problem-solving, through the devising of a natural language thought process
prior to answering a query. While their capabilities are well known across
mathematics and coding tasks, their impact on the task of machine translation
(MT) remains underexplored. In this work, we explore the benefits of the
generation of intermediate tokens when performing MT across multiple language
pairs of different levels of resourcedness and multiple setups. We find that
"thinking tokens" do not help LRMs better perform MT. This result generalizes
to models fine-tuned to reason before translating using distilled chain of
thought (CoT) inspired by human translators' practices. Specifically,
fine-tuning a model with synthetic CoT explanations detailing how to translate
step-by-step does not outperform standard input-output fine-tuning. However,
constructing the intermediate tokens by combining the outputs of modular
translation-specific prompting strategies results in improvements. Our findings
underscore that the contribution of intermediate tokens during fine-tuning
highly depends on the presence of translation attempts within them. More
broadly, our results suggest that using a teacher to refine target translations
or to expand parallel corpora is more impactful than distilling their CoT
explanations into "thinking" MT models.

Abstract: Multilingual question answering (QA) systems must ensure factual consistency
across languages, especially for objective queries such as What is jaundice?,
while also accounting for cultural variation in subjective responses. We
propose MIND, a user-in-the-loop fact-checking pipeline to detect factual and
cultural discrepancies in multilingual QA knowledge bases. MIND highlights
divergent answers to culturally sensitive questions (e.g., Who assists in
childbirth?) that vary by region and context. We evaluate MIND on a bilingual
QA system in the maternal and infant health domain and release a dataset of
bilingual questions annotated for factual and cultural inconsistencies. We
further test MIND on datasets from other domains to assess generalization. In
all cases, MIND reliably identifies inconsistencies, supporting the development
of more culturally aware and factually consistent QA systems.

TL;DR: TopoAlign框架通过将代码库转化为结构对齐的代码数据来训练数学大语言模型，显著提升自动形式化性能，无需额外人工标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数学大语言模型在自动形式化任务上表现受限，主要原因是缺乏大规模的非正式与正式数学语句对数据集，且代码生成训练与形式数学之间存在结构和语法差异。

Method: TopoAlign将代码分解为文档字符串、主函数和依赖函数，然后重新组装成结构上镜像形式数学语句的类似物，生成结构对齐的代码数据用于训练。

Result: 在DeepSeek-Math模型上，BEq@10性能提升17.77%，typecheck@10提升68.82%；在Herald模型上，BEq@10提升0.12%，typecheck@10提升1.09%。

Conclusion: 即使不引入新的数学知识，在结构对齐的代码数据上训练也能显著提升数学大语言模型的自动形式化性能，这对专业模型同样有益。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at both informal and formal (e.g. Lean 4)
mathematical reasoning but still struggle with autoformalisation, the task of
transforming informal into formal mathematical statements. Autoformalisation
helps pair the informal reasoning of LLMs with formal proof assistants which
enable machine-verifiable generation and mitigate hallucinations. Yet, the
performance of current Math LLMs is constrained by the scarcity of large-scale
corpora, particularly those containing pairs of informal and formal statements.
Although current models are trained to generate code from natural language
instructions, structural and syntactic differences between these and formal
mathematics limit effective transfer learning. We propose TopoAlign, a
framework that unlocks widely available code repositories as training resources
for Math LLMs. TopoAlign decomposes code into docstrings, main functions, and
dependency functions, and reassembles these components into analogues that
structurally mirror formal statements. This produces structurally aligned code
data that can be used for training Math LLMs without requiring additional human
annotation. We train two state-of-the-art models, DeepSeek-Math and Herald, and
evaluate them on the minif2f, Putnam, and ProofNet benchmarks. TopoAlign
provides substantial gains for DeepSeek-Math, improving performance by 17.77%
on BEq@10 and 68.82% on typecheck@10. Despite introducing no new mathematical
knowledge, our framework achieves gains of 0.12% and 1.09% for Herald on BEq@10
and typecheck@10, respectively, demonstrating that training on aligned code
data is beneficial even for specialized models.

Motivation: 当前LLM个性化依赖昂贵的人工反馈或交互日志，限制了可扩展性且忽略了更深层的用户属性。

Method: 整合Hofstede文化维度、Schwartz基本价值观、世界价值观调查和Big Five OCEAN人格特质等框架，生成基于用户画像的合成偏好数据对。

Result: 在400名亚马逊用户的书籍描述生成任务中，GRAVITY相比提示条件化、标准微调和简单合成对生成方法，实现了超过4%的偏好增益，用户研究显示86%的情况下更偏好GRAVITY输出。

Abstract: Personalization in LLMs often relies on costly human feedback or interaction
logs, limiting scalability and neglecting deeper user attributes. To reduce the
reliance on human annotations, we introduce GRAVITY (Generative Response with
Aligned Values, Interests, and Traits of You), a framework for generating
synthetic, profile-grounded preference data that captures users' interests,
values, beliefs, and personality traits. By integrating demographic, cultural,
and psychological frameworks -- including Hofstede's cultural dimensions,
Schwartz's basic values, the World Values Survey, and Big Five OCEAN traits --
GRAVITY synthesizes preference pairs to guide personalized content generation.
We evaluate GRAVITY on book descriptions for 400 Amazon users, comparing it to
prompt-based conditioning, standard fine-tuning, and naive synthetic pair
generation. Profile-grounded synthetic data consistently improves generation,
especially across multiple cultures (USA, Brazil, Japan, India), achieving over
4% higher preference gains across baselines, with user studies showing that
GRAVITY outputs are preferred over 86% of the time. Our results show that
scenario-grounded synthetic data can capture richer user variation, reduce
reliance on costly annotation, and produce more engaging, user-centered
content, offering a scalable path for LLM personalization.

### [96] [Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems on Unanswerable, Uncheatable, Realistic, Multi-hop Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11956)
*Gabrielle Kaili-May Liu,Bryan Li,Arman Cohan,William Gantt Walden,Eugene Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了CRUMQs（不可作弊、真实、不可回答和多跳查询）的自动生成流程，用于创建更具挑战性的RAG基准测试，解决现有基准测试中多跳和超出范围问题过于简单的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的RAG系统经常面临复杂查询，其中相关信息在语料库中缺失或不完整。现有RAG基准测试很少反映多跳或超出范围问题的真实复杂性，这些问题往往可以通过断开推理来作弊，或者只需要简单的知识回忆。

Method: 开发了第一个自动、难度可控的CRUMQs生成流程，可适应任何语料库和领域。该流程创建不可作弊、真实、不可回答和多跳查询。

Result: 在两个流行的RAG数据集上创建了CRUMQs，基准实验显示与先前的RAG基准相比，CRUMQs对RAG系统极具挑战性，作弊分数降低了高达81.0%。

Conclusion: CRUMQs生成流程提供了一种简单的方法来增强基准测试的难度和真实性，推动开发更强大的RAG系统。

Abstract: Real-world use cases often present RAG systems with complex queries for which
relevant information is missing from the corpus or is incomplete. In these
settings, RAG systems must be able to reject unanswerable, out-of-scope queries
and identify failures of retrieval and multi-hop reasoning. Despite this,
existing RAG benchmarks rarely reflect realistic task complexity for multi-hop
or out-of-scope questions, which often can be cheated via disconnected
reasoning (i.e., solved without genuine multi-hop inference) or require only
simple factual recall. This limits the ability for such benchmarks to uncover
limitations of existing RAG systems. To address this gap, we present the first
pipeline for automatic, difficulty-controlled creation of
un$\underline{c}$heatable, $\underline{r}$ealistic, $\underline{u}$nanswerable,
and $\underline{m}$ulti-hop $\underline{q}$uerie$\underline{s}$ (CRUMQs),
adaptable to any corpus and domain. We use our pipeline to create CRUMQs over
two popular RAG datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness via benchmark
experiments on leading retrieval-augmented LLMs. Results show that compared to
prior RAG benchmarks, CRUMQs are highly challenging for RAG systems and achieve
up to 81.0\% reduction in cheatability scores. More broadly, our pipeline
offers a simple way to enhance benchmark difficulty and realism and drive
development of more capable RAG systems.

### [97] [Direct Multi-Token Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11958)
*Xuan Luo,Weizhi Wang,Xifeng Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出直接多令牌解码（DMTD）方法，通过仅使用后期层一次生成多个令牌来加速LLM推理，无需额外参数或验证步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于预训练LLM中不同层承担不同角色的观察：早期层理解输入上下文，中间层处理任务特定信息，后期层将抽象表示转换为输出令牌。假设经过前两层处理后，隐藏状态已包含足够信息支持多令牌生成。

Method: DMTD方法在推理时仅使用后期层生成多个令牌，避免重复遍历早期和中间层。与推测解码不同，该方法不引入额外参数、辅助例程或后生成验证。

Result: 在有限数据集上微调的DMTD Qwen3-4B模型已显示出有希望的结果，实现高达2倍加速且仅有轻微性能损失。扩展分析表明其性能有望随训练数据集增大而进一步提升。

Conclusion: DMTD提供了一种高效的无参数LLM推理加速方法，通过利用模型层间分工特性实现多令牌并行生成，具有良好的可扩展性前景。

Abstract: Decoder-only transformers have become the standard architecture for large
language models (LLMs) due to their strong performance. Recent studies suggest
that, in pre-trained LLMs, early, middle, and late layers may serve distinct
roles: Early layers focus on understanding the input context, middle layers
handle task-specific processing, and late layers convert abstract
representations into output tokens. We hypothesize that once representations
have been processed by the early and middle layers, the resulting hidden states
may encapsulate sufficient information to support the generation of multiple
tokens using only the late layers, eliminating the need to repeatedly traverse
the early and middle layers. We refer to this inference paradigm as Direct
Multi-Token Decoding (DMTD). Unlike speculative decoding, our method introduces
no additional parameters, auxiliary routines, or post-generation verification.
Despite being trained on a limited dataset, a fine-tuned DMTD Qwen3-4B model
has already demonstrated promising results, achieving up to a 2x speedup with
only minor performance loss. Moreover, as shown in our scaling analysis, its
performance is expected to further improve with larger training datasets.

*Weiwei Sun,Miao Lu,Zhan Ling,Kang Liu,Xuesong Yao,Yiming Yang,Jiecao Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Context-Folding框架让LLM智能体能够主动管理工作上下文，通过分支处理子任务并折叠中间步骤，在保持性能的同时将活动上下文减少10倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型智能体在长视野任务中受到上下文长度的根本限制，需要更有效的上下文管理方法。

Method: 开发了Context-Folding框架，让智能体能够程序化地分支处理子任务，完成后折叠中间步骤保留结果摘要；并设计了端到端强化学习框架FoldGRPO，通过特定过程奖励鼓励有效的任务分解和上下文管理。

Result: 在复杂长视野任务（深度研究和软件工程）上，折叠智能体匹配或超越ReAct基线，同时使用10倍更小的活动上下文，并显著优于基于摘要的上下文管理模型。

Conclusion: Context-Folding框架成功解决了LLM智能体在长视野任务中的上下文限制问题，提供了更高效的上下文管理方案。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are fundamentally constrained by context
length on long-horizon tasks. We introduce Context-Folding, a framework that
empowers agents to actively manage their working context. An agent can
procedurally branch into a sub-trajectory to handle a subtask and then fold it
upon completion, collapsing the intermediate steps while retaining a concise
summary of the outcome. To make this behavior learnable, we develop an
end-to-end reinforcement learning framework FoldGRPO with specific process
rewards to encourage effective task decomposition and context management. On
complex long-horizon tasks (Deep Research and SWE), our folding agent matches
or outperforms the ReAct baselines while using an active context 10$\times$
smaller and significantly outperforms models that rely on summarization-based
context management.

*Jasivan Alex Sivakumar,Philipp Borchert,Ronald Cardenas,Gerasimos Lampouras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文指出自动形式化不仅仅是翻译过程，还需要先进行猜想步骤。作者创建了ConjectureBench数据集和评估框架来专门衡量LLMs的猜想能力，发现现有模型的自动形式化性能被高估。他们提出了Lean-FIRe方法来改进猜想和自动形式化，并首次成功实现了PutnamBench问题的端到端自动形式化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动形式化研究忽视了猜想这一关键前置步骤，许多数学问题需要先猜想结论才能进行形式化。由于LLMs在自动形式化方面已有困难，且猜想能力的评估有限且常与自动形式化或证明任务混淆，因此需要专门研究猜想能力的影响。

Method: 作者扩充现有数据集创建ConjectureBench，重新设计评估框架和指标来专门衡量LLMs的猜想能力。提出了推理时方法Lean-FIRe来改进猜想和自动形式化，并在GPT-4.1和DeepSeek-V3.1上进行了测试。

Result: 评估发现当在评估中考虑猜想时，基础模型的自动形式化性能被显著高估。使用Lean-FIRe方法，GPT-4.1成功端到端自动形式化了13个PutnamBench问题，DeepSeek-V3.1成功形式化了7个问题。

Conclusion: LLMs具备生成准确猜想所需的知识，但改进自动形式化性能需要将猜想作为独立任务处理，并研究如何正确将其整合到自动形式化流程中。论文为未来研究提供了改进猜想能力的指导方向。

Abstract: Autoformalisation, the task of expressing informal mathematical statements in
formal language, is often viewed as a direct translation process. This,
however, disregards a critical preceding step: conjecturing. Many mathematical
problems cannot be formalised directly without first conjecturing a conclusion
such as an explicit answer, or a specific bound. Since Large Language Models
(LLMs) already struggle with autoformalisation, and the evaluation of their
conjecturing ability is limited and often entangled within autoformalisation or
proof, it is particularly challenging to understand its effect. To address this
gap, we augment existing datasets to create ConjectureBench, and redesign the
evaluation framework and metric specifically to measure the conjecturing
capabilities of LLMs both as a distinct task and within the autoformalisation
pipeline. Our evaluation of foundational models, including GPT-4.1 and
DeepSeek-V3.1, reveals that their autoformalisation performance is
substantially overestimated when the conjecture is accounted for during
evaluation. However, the conjecture should not be assumed to be provided. We
design an inference-time method, Lean-FIRe to improve conjecturing and
autoformalisation, which, to the best of our knowledge, achieves the first
successful end-to-end autoformalisation of 13 PutnamBench problems with GPT-4.1
and 7 with DeepSeek-V3.1. We demonstrate that while LLMs possess the requisite
knowledge to generate accurate conjectures, improving autoformalisation
performance requires treating conjecturing as an independent task, and
investigating further how to correctly integrate it within autoformalisation.
Finally, we provide forward-looking guidance to steer future research toward
improving conjecturing, an overlooked step of formal mathematical reasoning.

*Ryan Shea,Yunan Lu,Liang Qiu,Zhou Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAGE是一个用于多轮交互智能体评估的用户模拟框架，通过整合业务上下文知识来生成更真实和多样化的交互，能发现更多智能体错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多轮交互智能体评估方法依赖人工评估或模拟通用用户，忽视了领域特定原则，无法捕捉真实用户行为。

Method: 提出SAGE框架，整合自上而下的业务逻辑知识（如理想客户画像）和自下而上的业务基础设施知识（如产品目录、FAQ、知识库），基于真实客户角色生成交互。

Result: 该方法生成的交互更真实和多样化，能识别高达33%的智能体错误。

Conclusion: SAGE作为评估工具能有效支持错误发现和智能体迭代改进。

Abstract: Evaluating multi-turn interactive agents is challenging due to the need for
human assessment. Evaluation with simulated users has been introduced as an
alternative, however existing approaches typically model generic users and
overlook the domain-specific principles required to capture realistic behavior.
We propose SAGE, a novel user Simulation framework for multi-turn AGent
Evaluation that integrates knowledge from business contexts. SAGE incorporates
top-down knowledge rooted in business logic, such as ideal customer profiles,
grounding user behavior in realistic customer personas. We further integrate
bottom-up knowledge taken from business agent infrastructure (e.g., product
catalogs, FAQs, and knowledge bases), allowing the simulator to generate
interactions that reflect users' information needs and expectations in a
company's target market. Through empirical evaluation, we find that this
approach produces interactions that are more realistic and diverse, while also
identifying up to 33% more agent errors, highlighting its effectiveness as an
evaluation tool to support bug-finding and iterative agent improvement.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于离散数学逻辑等价问题的自动问题生成系统，通过形式化语言和线性时间算法生成难度均匀的问题，有效应对在线教学中的抄袭问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线教学环境中抄袭问题日益严重，需要为每个学生生成独特的问题来防止抄袭，同时提供大量练习题。现有方法生成的问题难度不一致且效率低下。

Method: 使用形式化语言定义逻辑等价问题，将其转化为两组生成规则，并开发线性时间算法进行问题生成。

Result: 实验表明生成问题的准确性与教科书问题相当，难度也与教科书问题相似，优于大型语言模型生成的问题。

Conclusion: 该自动问题生成系统能够高效生成质量与教科书相当的逻辑等价问题，有效解决抄袭问题并提供练习资源。

Abstract: Academic dishonesty is met with zero tolerance in higher education, yet
plagiarism has become increasingly prevalent in the era of online teaching and
learning. Automatic Question Generation (AQG) presents a potential solution to
mitigate copying by creating unique questions for each student. Additionally,
AQG can provide a vast array of practice questions. Our AQG focuses on
generating logical equivalence questions for Discrete Mathematics, a
foundational course for first-year computer science students. A literature
review reveals that existing AQGs for this type of question generate all
propositions that meet user-defined constraints, resulting in inefficiencies
and a lack of uniform question difficulty. To address this, we propose a new
approach that defines logical equivalence questions using a formal language,
translates this language into two sets of generation rules, and develops a
linear-time algorithm for question generation. We evaluated our AQG through two
experiments. The first involved a group of students completing questions
generated by our system. Statistical analysis shows that the accuracy of these
questions is comparable to that of textbook questions. The second experiment
assessed the number of steps required to solve our generated questions,
textbook questions, and those generated by multiple large language models. The
results indicated that the difficulty of our questions was similar to that of
textbook questions, confirming the quality of our AQG.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 比较神经符号系统和LLM系统在农业领域信息抽取的表现，LLM系统在F1分数上优于神经符号系统，但各有优缺点：神经符号系统运行更快、可控性更强，而LLM系统性能更高、部署维护更简单。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前信息抽取领域过度依赖大语言模型，忽视了传统符号或统计系统的经验积累，需要比较不同方法的实际表现。

Method: 在农业领域（猪肉、乳制品、作物）的9个访谈上，分别评估神经符号系统和LLM系统的信息抽取性能。

Result: LLM系统整体表现更好（总F1：69.4 vs 52.7；核心F1：63.0 vs 47.2），但神经符号系统运行速度更快、可控性更强。

Conclusion: 部署NLP系统存在"隐藏成本"，需要在性能、效率和可控性之间取得平衡。

Abstract: The current trend in information extraction (IE) is to rely extensively on
large language models, effectively discarding decades of experience in building
symbolic or statistical IE systems. This paper compares a neuro-symbolic (NS)
and an LLM-based IE system in the agricultural domain, evaluating them on nine
interviews across pork, dairy, and crop subdomains. The LLM-based system
outperforms the NS one (F1 total: 69.4 vs. 52.7; core: 63.0 vs. 47.2), where
total includes all extracted information and core focuses on essential details.
However, each system has trade-offs: the NS approach offers faster runtime,
greater control, and high accuracy in context-free tasks but lacks
generalizability, struggles with contextual nuances, and requires significant
resources to develop and maintain. The LLM-based system achieves higher
performance, faster deployment, and easier maintenance but has slower runtime,
limited control, model dependency and hallucination risks. Our findings
highlight the "hidden cost" of deploying NLP systems in real-world
applications, emphasizing the need to balance performance, efficiency, and
control.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为治愈性提示优化(CPR)的框架，通过清理不良提示和生成额外任务描述来减少LLM的幻觉问题，显著提高生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常生成看似合理但错误的"幻觉"事实，一个重要但常被忽视的原因是用户使用了结构不良或模糊的提示，导致模型基于假设而非实际意图生成响应。

Method: CPR是一个即插即用的治愈性提示优化框架，包含两个步骤：1)清理不良提示，2)使用微调的小型语言模型生成额外的信息性任务描述，以对齐用户意图和提示。

Result: 实证研究表明，应用CPR的提示在没有任何外部知识的情况下，相比原始提示实现了超过90%的胜率，显著提高了生成质量并减轻了幻觉问题。

Conclusion: CPR框架有效解决了由不良提示引起的LLM幻觉问题，通过优化提示结构和对齐用户意图，显著提升了模型生成质量。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) highlight their fluency
in generating responses to diverse prompts. However, these models sometimes
generate plausible yet incorrect ``hallucinated" facts, undermining trust. A
frequent but often overlooked cause of such errors is the use of poorly
structured or vague prompts by users, leading LLMs to base responses on assumed
rather than actual intentions. To mitigate hallucinations induced by these
ill-formed prompts, we introduce Curative Prompt Refinement (CPR), a
plug-and-play framework for curative prompt refinement that 1) cleans
ill-formed prompts, and 2) generates additional informative task descriptions
to align the intention of the user and the prompt using a fine-tuned small
language model. When applied to language models, we discover that CPR
significantly increases the quality of generation while also mitigating
hallucination. Empirical studies show that prompts with CPR applied achieves
over a 90\% win rate over the original prompts without any external knowledge.

<details>

Motivation: LLM在幻觉问题上持续面临挑战，而格式错误的提示（包含歧义、语法错误或不完整信息）对幻觉的影响相对未被充分探索

Method: MPR框架通过多个阶段系统化改进格式错误的提示，每个阶段使用针对特定任务微调的小型语言模型处理标点、拼写错误和关键词误用等问题，通过迭代增强提示清晰度和自反机制进行优先级排序

Result: 在幻觉基准测试中，经MPR优化的提示相比原始形式胜率超过85%，证明其能有效减少幻觉并提高LLM输出准确性

Conclusion: MPR提供了一个轻量级且适应性强的解决方案，可与现有后处理幻觉缓解框架结合，增强LLM在各种领域的可靠性

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong
performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks. However,
LLMs continue to encounter challenges with hallucinations, where models
generate plausible but incorrect information. While several factors contribute
to hallucinations, the impact of ill-formed prompts, prompts with ambiguous
wording, incorrect grammar, or incomplete information, was relatively under
explored. To address this, we introduce Multi-stage Prompt Refinement (MPR), a
framework designed to systematically improve these ill-formed prompts across
multiple stages. Each stage addresses specific errors such as punctuation,
typographical mistakes, and misuse of key terms, using small language models
(SLMs) fine-tuned for these tasks. MPR iteratively enhances the clarity of
prompts with additional context and employs a self-reflection mechanism with
ranking to prioritize the most relevant input. Experimental results on
hallucination benchmarks show that prompts refined by MPR achieve over an 85~\%
win rate compared to their original forms, demonstrating its effectiveness in
reducing hallucinations and improving LLM output accuracy. Interestingly, we
reveal that MPR can be combined with existing post-hoc hallucination mitigation
frameworks, further enhancing its versatility. MPR provides a lightweight and
adaptable solution for enhancing LLM reliability across various domains.

Conclusion: 不确定性量化是解决LLM幻觉问题的关键研究方向，当前方法已取得进展但仍存在局限，未来需要在方法创新和应用扩展方面继续探索。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the
landscape of natural language processing, enabling breakthroughs across a wide
range of areas including question answering, machine translation, and text
summarization. Yet, their deployment in real-world applications has raised
concerns over reliability and trustworthiness, as LLMs remain prone to
hallucinations that produce plausible but factually incorrect outputs.
Uncertainty quantification (UQ) has emerged as a central research direction to
address this issue, offering principled measures for assessing the
trustworthiness of model generations. We begin by introducing the foundations
of UQ, from its formal definition to the traditional distinction between
epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, and then highlight how these concepts have
been adapted to the context of LLMs. Building on this, we examine the role of
UQ in hallucination detection, where quantifying uncertainty provides a
mechanism for identifying unreliable generations and improving reliability. We
systematically categorize a wide spectrum of existing methods along multiple
dimensions and present empirical results for several representative approaches.
Finally, we discuss current limitations and outline promising future research
directions, providing a clearer picture of the current landscape of LLM UQ for
hallucination detection.

Method: 利用大语言模型构建提示词重写器，采用精心设计的奖励系统和迭代直接偏好优化训练流程，无需监督微调数据即可优化提示词。

Result: 该方法在各种T2I模型和基准测试中一致提升了图像-文本对齐度、视觉质量和美学效果，优于强基线方法，且具有良好的跨模型迁移能力。

Conclusion: 提示词重写是一种有效、可扩展且实用的模型无关策略，能够显著改进文本到图像生成系统的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have achieved impressive
results, yet existing models often struggle with simple or underspecified
prompts, leading to suboptimal image-text alignment, aesthetics, and quality.
We propose a prompt rewriting framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) to refine user inputs before feeding them into T2I backbones. Our
approach introduces a carefully designed reward system and an iterative direct
preference optimization (DPO) training pipeline, enabling the rewriter to
enhance prompts without requiring supervised fine-tuning data. We evaluate our
method across diverse T2I models and benchmarks. Results show that our prompt
rewriter consistently improves image-text alignment, visual quality, and
aesthetics, outperforming strong baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong
transferability by showing that a prompt rewriter trained on one T2I backbone
generalizes effectively to others without needing to be retrained. We also
systematically study scalability, evaluating how performance gains scale with
the capacity of the large LLM used as the rewriter. These findings highlight
that prompt rewriting is an effective, scalable, and practical model-agnostic
strategy for improving T2I systems. We plan to release the code and trained
prompt rewriters soon.

TL;DR: 提出了分层对齐方法，针对Transformer架构中不同功能层进行定向优化，避免了传统DPO的"对齐税"问题，在保持语法流畅性的同时显著提升逻辑一致性和事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐技术将模型视为单一实体进行统一优化，忽视了Transformer架构中不同层次的功能专门化（从语法处理到抽象推理）。

Method: 引入分层对齐方法，对模型的不同功能层块进行定向DPO：局部层（语法）、中间层（逻辑）和全局层（事实性），使用LoRA进行精确微调。

Result: 实验表明，局部层对齐提升语法流畅性，全局层对齐不仅改善事实一致性，还是提升逻辑一致性的最有效策略，所有分层策略都避免了标准DPO中的"对齐税"。

Conclusion: 分层对齐为模型对齐提供了更资源高效、可控和可解释的路径，展示了从整体优化转向结构感知精确微调的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Existing alignment techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), typically treat the model as a monolithic
entity, applying uniform optimization pressure across all layers. This approach
overlooks the functional specialization within the Transformer architecture,
where different layers are known to handle distinct tasks from syntax to
abstract reasoning. In this paper, we challenge this one-size-fits-all paradigm
by introducing Hierarchical Alignment, a novel method that applies targeted DPO
to distinct functional blocks of a model's layers: local (syntax), intermediate
(logic), and global (factuality). Through a series of controlled experiments on
state-of-the-art models like Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen1.5-7B using LoRA for
surgical fine-tuning, our results, evaluated by a powerful LLM-as-Judge,
demonstrate significant and predictable improvements. Specifically, aligning
the local layers (Local-Align) enhances grammatical fluency. More importantly,
aligning the global layers (Global-Align) not only improves factual consistency
as hypothesized but also proves to be the most effective strategy for enhancing
logical coherence, outperforming all baselines. Critically, all hierarchical
strategies successfully avoid the "alignment tax" observed in standard DPO,
where gains in fluency come at the cost of degraded logical reasoning. These
findings establish a more resource-efficient, controllable, and interpretable
path for model alignment, highlighting the immense potential of shifting from
monolithic optimization to structure-aware surgical fine-tuning to build more
advanced and reliable LLMs.

TL;DR: APCE提出了一种上下文感知的输入块选择方法，通过低维语义相似度匹配来选择最重要的输入块，从而减少长上下文Transformer模型的内存占用并缓解ContextRot现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长上下文Transformer模型的两个关键挑战：(1) 由于二次自注意力和线性KV缓存扩展导致的内存占用增长；(2) 随着上下文长度增加，Transformer性能下降的ContextRot现象。

Method: APCE通过低维语义相似度匹配，选择与当前查询最相关的输入块进行处理，直接操作输入数据，不依赖特定硬件或CUDA环境。

Result: 在长上下文摘要任务中，APCE使用50%-70%的输入序列就能达到与完整密集基线相当或更优的性能，显著改善了KV缓存和自注意力的内存效率。

Conclusion: APCE为长上下文Transformer模型提供了一种兼容性强、可扩展的上下文感知效率解决方案，有望激发其他相关长上下文任务的进一步研究。

Abstract: Deploying useful Long-Context Transformer Models (LCTMs) requires addressing
two key challenges: (1) A growing memory footprint due to quadratic
self-attention and linear KV-cache scaling in memory as sequence length
increases; (2) the ContextRot phenomena where empirical evidence suggests that
transformer architecture's performance degrades with increasing context length.
Given the shared dependency on the input, a natural question arises: Can we
surgically select the most important input chunks for processing to
synergistically (a) reduce the memory footprint, and (b) mitigate the
ContextRot effects? In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative
for long-context summarization tasks. We propose APCE as a context-aware
solution to select the most important input chunks through low-dimensional
semantic similarity matching with the current query. By directly operating on
the input, APCE decouples from strict dependency on underlying hardware or CUDA
environments, promising a compatible solution scalable to different deployment
systems. Our empirical evaluations have demonstrated superior or on-par
summarization performance for APCE compared to the full dense baseline using a
fraction (50%-70%) of the input sequence resulting in KV-cache and
self-attention memory efficiency improvements. We hope our findings inspire
further research on context-aware efficiency solutions for LCTMs geared towards
other relevant long-context tasks.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了Verily行为健康安全过滤器(VBHSF)在精神健康危机检测中的表现，发现其在两个数据集上都表现出高敏感性和特异性，优于NVIDIA NeMo和OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest等开源内容审核护栏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理精神健康紧急情况时经常提供有害或不恰当的建议，助长破坏性行为，因此需要开发专门的安全过滤器来保护用户。

Method: 使用Verily精神健康危机数据集(1,800条模拟消息)和NVIDIA Aegis AI内容安全数据集子集(794条精神健康相关消息)，通过临床医生标注评估VBHSF性能，并与两个开源内容审核护栏进行比较分析。

Result: VBHSF在Verily数据集上表现出高敏感度(0.990)和特异性(0.992)，F1分数为0.939；在NVIDIA数据集上保持高敏感度(0.982)和准确率(0.921)。相比其他护栏，VBHSF在所有情况下都表现出显著更高的敏感度(p < 0.001)。

Conclusion: VBHSF展现出稳健、可推广的性能，优先考虑敏感度以最小化遗漏危机，这是医疗应用的关键特性。

Abstract: Large language models often mishandle psychiatric emergencies, offering
harmful or inappropriate advice and enabling destructive behaviors. This study
evaluated the Verily behavioral health safety filter (VBHSF) on two datasets:
the Verily Mental Health Crisis Dataset containing 1,800 simulated messages and
the NVIDIA Aegis AI Content Safety Dataset subsetted to 794 mental
health-related messages. The two datasets were clinician-labelled and we
evaluated performance using the clinician labels. Additionally, we carried out
comparative performance analyses against two open source, content moderation
guardrails: OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest and NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails. The VBHSF
demonstrated, well-balanced performance on the Verily Mental Health Crisis
Dataset v1.0, achieving high sensitivity (0.990) and specificity (0.992) in
detecting any mental health crises. It achieved an F1-score of 0.939,
sensitivity ranged from 0.917-0.992, and specificity was >= 0.978 in
identifying specific crisis categories. When evaluated against the NVIDIA Aegis
AI Content Safety Dataset 2.0, VBHSF performance remained highly sensitive
(0.982) and accuracy (0.921) with reduced specificity (0.859). When compared
with the NVIDIA NeMo and OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest guardrails, the VBHSF
demonstrated superior performance metrics across both datasets, achieving
significantly higher sensitivity in all cases (all p < 0.001) and higher
specificity relative to NVIDIA NeMo (p < 0.001), but not to OpenAI Omni
Moderation Latest (p = 0.094). NVIDIA NeMo and OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest
exhibited inconsistent performance across specific crisis types, with
sensitivity for some categories falling below 0.10. Overall, the VBHSF
demonstrated robust, generalizable performance that prioritizes sensitivity to
minimize missed crises, a crucial feature for healthcare applications.

TL;DR: 提出PACE方法，通过让LLMs生成平行关联链来评估其创造力，有效避免数据污染问题，并与人类创造力评估结果高度相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs创造力评估面临数据污染和人工评估成本高的挑战，需要一种高效可靠的评估方法。

Method: PACE方法要求LLMs生成平行关联链，通过分析这些链来评估模型的创造力表现。

Result: PACE与Chatbot Arena创意写作排名高度相关（Spearman's ρ=0.739），高性能LLMs达到普通人类水平，但专业人士仍优于LLMs；语言分析显示人类和LLMs关联具体性都下降，但人类关联模式更多样。

Conclusion: PACE提供了一种高效可靠的LLMs创造力评估方法，揭示了LLMs在创造力方面与人类的差距和特点。

Abstract: The evaluation of LLMs' creativity represents a crucial research domain,
though challenges such as data contamination and costly human assessments often
impede progress. Drawing inspiration from human creativity assessment, we
propose PACE, asking LLMs to generate Parallel Association Chains to Evaluate
their creativity. PACE minimizes the risk of data contamination and offers a
straightforward, highly efficient evaluation, as evidenced by its strong
correlation with Chatbot Arena Creative Writing rankings (Spearman's $\rho =
0.739$, $p < 0.001$) across various proprietary and open-source models. A
comparative analysis of associative creativity between LLMs and humans reveals
that while high-performing LLMs achieve scores comparable to average human
performance, professional humans consistently outperform LLMs. Furthermore,
linguistic analysis reveals that both humans and LLMs exhibit a trend of
decreasing concreteness in their associations, and humans demonstrating a
greater diversity of associative patterns.

TL;DR: 本文提出AdaXEval评估方法，通过构建与训练数据同源的双语多选问答数据集，研究LLMs在多语言领域适应中的知识获取机制，发现跨语言知识转移仍具挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言领域适应(ML-DA)中知识获取机制不明确，特别是知识如何在语言内部学习并在语言间转移，这导致在低资源设置下性能不佳。

Method: 提出AdaXEval自适应评估方法，从双语领域语料构建多选QA数据集；通过持续训练LLMs并追踪领域事实获取过程，分析从训练数据到知识的转化机制。

Result: 在13B英日双语LLM上的实验表明，即使使用高质量双语语料，跨语言知识转移仍然具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 跨语言知识转移是ML-DA中的关键挑战，需要更深入理解知识获取机制以改进多语言领域适应性能。

Abstract: Multilingual domain adaptation (ML-DA) is widely used to learn new domain
knowledge across languages into large language models (LLMs). Although many
methods have been proposed to improve domain adaptation, the mechanisms of
multilingual knowledge acquisition, how domain knowledge is learned within a
language and transferred across languages, remain underexplored. This gap leads
to suboptimal performance, particularly in low-resource settings. This work
examines the learning dynamics of LLMs during ML-DA. Because prior ML-DA
studies often train and evaluate on datasets with mismatched knowledge
coverage, we propose AdaXEval, an adaptive evaluation method that builds
multiple-choice QA datasets from the same bilingual domain corpus used for
training, thereby directly studying multilingual knowledge acquisition. Through
continual training of LLMs with diverse data recipes, we track how LLMs acquire
domain facts and pinpoint the mechanism behind the transformation process from
domain training data to knowledge. Our experiments on a 13B English-Japanese
bilingual LLM reveal that cross-lingual transfer remains challenging despite a
high-quality bilingual corpus. The code has been released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端大型语音语言模型在对话生成方面表现出色，但在语义理解基准测试中始终落后于传统流水线系统，需要揭示其中的模态差距问题。

Method: 系统分析语音和文本的粗粒度与细粒度表征，引入对齐路径评分量化token级对齐质量，并设计角度投影和长度归一化等干预策略。

Result: 发现深层表征在方向（余弦相似度）上更对齐，但在幅度（欧氏距离）上更发散，表征相似性与模态差距强相关，提出的干预策略显示出改善语音输入正确性的潜力。

Conclusion: 这是对LSLMs中模态差距和对齐机制的首次系统实证分析，为未来优化提供了理论和方法的指导。

Abstract: End-to-end Large Speech Language Models (LSLMs) have demonstrated impressive
conversational generation abilities, yet consistently fall short of traditional
pipeline systems on semantic understanding benchmarks. In this work, we reveal
through systematic experimentation that although LSLMs lose some text input
performance after speech-text alignment training, the performance gap between
speech and text inputs is more pronounced, which we refer to as the modality
gap. To understand this gap, we analyze both coarse- and fine-grained text and
speech representations. At the coarse-grained level, representations of speech
and text in deeper layers are found to be increasingly aligned in direction
(cosine similarity), while concurrently diverging in magnitude (Euclidean
distance). We further find that representation similarity is strongly
correlated with the modality gap. At the fine-grained level, a spontaneous
token-level alignment pattern between text and speech representations is
observed. Based on this, we introduce the Alignment Path Score to quantify
token-level alignment quality, which exhibits stronger correlation with the
modality gap. Building on these insights, we design targeted interventions on
critical tokens through angle projection and length normalization. These
strategies demonstrate the potential to improve correctness for speech inputs.
Our study provides the first systematic empirical analysis of the modality gap
and alignment mechanisms in LSLMs, offering both theoretical and methodological
guidance for future optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态大语言模型的广泛应用，安全问题日益突出。现有基准测试未能充分评估多轮对话中的安全风险，而多轮对话在日常交互中更为常见且风险更高。

Method: 构建了包含10,000个样本的SafeMT基准测试，涵盖17种场景和4种越狱方法。提出了安全指数(SI)来评估对话安全性，并设计了对话安全调节器来检测对话中的恶意意图。

Result: 评估了17个模型，发现随着有害对话轮次增加，攻击成功率上升，表明模型的安全机制不足以识别对话交互中的危险。提出的调节器比现有防护模型更能有效降低多轮攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在多轮对话中的安全机制存在不足，需要专门的对话安全调节器来增强防护能力，SafeMT基准测试为这一领域的研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: With the widespread use of multi-modal Large Language models (MLLMs), safety
issues have become a growing concern. Multi-turn dialogues, which are more
common in everyday interactions, pose a greater risk than single prompts;
however, existing benchmarks do not adequately consider this situation. To
encourage the community to focus on the safety issues of these models in
multi-turn dialogues, we introduce SafeMT, a benchmark that features dialogues
of varying lengths generated from harmful queries accompanied by images. This
benchmark consists of 10,000 samples in total, encompassing 17 different
scenarios and four jailbreak methods. Additionally, we propose Safety Index
(SI) to evaluate the general safety of MLLMs during conversations. We assess
the safety of 17 models using this benchmark and discover that the risk of
successful attacks on these models increases as the number of turns in harmful
dialogues rises. This observation indicates that the safety mechanisms of these
models are inadequate for recognizing the hazard in dialogue interactions. We
propose a dialogue safety moderator capable of detecting malicious intent
concealed within conversations and providing MLLMs with relevant safety
policies. Experimental results from several open-source models indicate that
this moderator is more effective in reducing multi-turn ASR compared to existed
guard models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Credal Transformer通过引入基于证据理论的Credal注意力机制，用概率分布集合替代单一注意力向量，直接量化模型不确定性，显著减少LLM的幻觉和自信错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的Softmax函数产生"人工确定性"，将模糊的注意力分数压缩为单一概率分布，丢弃了每层的不确定性信息，导致LLM产生事实错误但自信的断言（幻觉）。

Method: 提出Credal Transformer，用Credal注意力机制（CAM）替代标准注意力。CAM基于证据理论，将注意力分数重新概念化为Dirichlet分布的证据质量，产生"credal set"（分布集合）而非单一注意力向量。

Result: Credal Transformer能够识别分布外输入、量化模糊性，并在无法回答的问题上通过弃权显著减少自信错误。

Conclusion: 该架构有效缓解了幻觉问题，提供了一种将不确定性量化直接集成到模型中的设计范式，为更可靠的AI奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hallucinate, generating factually incorrect yet
confident assertions. We argue this stems from the Transformer's Softmax
function, which creates "Artificial Certainty" by collapsing ambiguous
attention scores into a single probability distribution, discarding uncertainty
information at each layer. To fix this, we introduce the Credal Transformer,
which replaces standard attention with a Credal Attention Mechanism (CAM) based
on evidential theory. CAM produces a "credal set" (a set of distributions)
instead of a single attention vector, with the set's size directly measuring
model uncertainty. We implement this by re-conceptualizing attention scores as
evidence masses for a Dirichlet distribution: sufficient evidence recovers
standard attention, while insufficient evidence yields a diffuse distribution,
representing ambiguity. Empirically, the Credal Transformer identifies
out-of-distribution inputs, quantifies ambiguity, and significantly reduces
confident errors on unanswerable questions by abstaining. Our contribution is a
new architecture to mitigate hallucinations and a design paradigm that
integrates uncertainty quantification directly into the model, providing a
foundation for more reliable AI.

Abstract: With the increasing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), parallel
reasoning has emerged as a new inference paradigm that enhances reasoning
robustness by concurrently exploring multiple lines of thought before
converging on a final answer. It has become a significant trend to explore
parallel reasoning to overcome the fragility of standard sequential methods and
improve practical performance. In this paper, we aim to survey and summarize
the progress and challenges of parallel reasoning. We first present a formal
definition of parallel reasoning and clarify its distinction from related
concepts like Chain-of-Thought. Then, we organize and discuss advanced
techniques based on a novel taxonomy, including non-interactive reasoning,
interactive reasoning, and efficiency-focused decoding strategies.
Additionally, we explore various application scenarios, such as solving complex
problems and enhancing the reliability of LLM outputs.Finally, we highlight the
core challenges of parallel reasoning and suggest potential directions for
future research. We hope that our work can provide a useful roadmap for
beginners and encourage more research on improving parallel reasoning methods.

Motivation: 研究动机是验证在离散文本推理中证明有效的推理时扩展技术（多样本生成结合PRM/ORM重排序）是否能够成功适应连续空间的推理任务。

Method: 使用COCONUT连续空间推理LM作为骨干模型，通过基于dropout的采样生成多样化推理路径，并分析Pass@N指标来评估性能提升潜力。

Result: 研究发现虽然能够生成多样化的推理路径，但在连续空间中训练PRM和ORM模型仅带来边际改进，无法有效区分正确和错误推理。

Conclusion: 当前连续推理LM的训练框架需要不仅优化准确性，还需明确融入能够在推理时用于区分正确和错误思维的归纳偏置。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling through multiple sample generation in combination with
Process- or Outcome-Reward Model (PRM or ORM) re-ranking has proven effective
for text-based reasoning in large language models. This paper investigates
whether such established techniques can be successfully adapted to reasoning in
the continuous space, using COCONUT (Hao et al. 2024) continuous space
reasoning LM as the backbone. We demonstrate the feasibility of generating
diverse reasoning paths through dropout-based sampling. Our Pass@N analysis on
the generated samples reveals the potential that could enable a significant
gain in performance akin to observed gain in the discrete space. However, we
highlight unique challenges faced for materializing this gain in the continuous
thought space. In particular, working recipes for data generation and training
PRM and ORM models in the discrete space unlocks only marginal improvements in
the continuous space. Through probing various aspects including geometric
properties and trajectory dynamics we identify the underlying reasons that
prevent effective discrimination between correct and incorrect reasoning
(essential for the functioning of PRM and ORM). Our findings reveal that
current limitations stem from the absence of key inductive biases in continuous
thought representations. We argue that the training frameworks for continuous
reasoning LMs require not only to optimize for accuracy but also to explicitly
incorporate inductive biases that could be utilized during inference-time for
discrimination of correct and incorrect thoughts.\footnote{Our code and data
will be publicly available.}

Motivation: 现有方法忽略了真实实验室中的常识性生物医学概念知识，如某些药物与特定治疗根本不相容的机制先验知识，导致生物医学知识图谱表示不足。

Method: 从大语言模型提取生物医学实体的语义丰富治疗相关文本表示，并用这些表示来微调知识图谱嵌入模型，将治疗相关知识注入KGE中。

Conclusion: LLaDR通过注入LLM提取的治疗相关知识，显著改善了生物医学概念在知识图谱中的表示，增强了对于研究不足或复杂适应症的语义理解。

Abstract: Drug repurposing plays a critical role in accelerating treatment discovery,
especially for complex and rare diseases. Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs),
which encode rich clinical associations, have been widely adopted to support
this task. However, existing methods largely overlook common-sense biomedical
concept knowledge in real-world labs, such as mechanistic priors indicating
that certain drugs are fundamentally incompatible with specific treatments. To
address this gap, we propose LLaDR, a Large Language Model-assisted framework
for Drug Repurposing, which improves the representation of biomedical concepts
within KGs. Specifically, we extract semantically enriched treatment-related
textual representations of biomedical entities from large language models
(LLMs) and use them to fine-tune knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models. By
injecting treatment-relevant knowledge into KGE, LLaDR largely improves the
representation of biomedical concepts, enhancing semantic understanding of
under-studied or complex indications. Experiments based on benchmarks
demonstrate that LLaDR achieves state-of-the-art performance across different
scenarios, with case studies on Alzheimer's disease further confirming its
robustness and effectiveness. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了大音频语言模型中的时间偏差问题，发现模型在预测事件时间戳时存在系统性偏差，表现为预测时间比真实时间提前或延后，且偏差随音频长度增加而累积。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大音频语言模型在音频理解和多模态推理中应用日益广泛，但其定位事件发生时间的能力尚未得到充分探索。本文旨在揭示模型在时间戳预测中的关键局限性。

Method: 通过在带时间戳的数据集上进行控制实验，研究时间偏差现象，并提出时间偏差指数来量化系统性错位，同时开发可视化框架进行分析。

Result: 研究发现：(1)时间偏差在数据集和模型中普遍存在；(2)偏差随音频长度增加而累积，在长录音中可达数十秒；(3)偏差程度因事件类型和位置而异。

Conclusion: 当前大音频语言模型存在基本的时间定位局限性，需要开发具有时间鲁棒性的架构来解决这一问题。

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) are increasingly applied to audio
understanding and multimodal reasoning, yet their ability to locate when events
occur remains underexplored. We present the first systematic study of temporal
bias in LALMs, revealing a key limitation in their timestamp prediction. For
example, when asked "At which second does the lecturer introduce the key
formula?", models often predict timestamps that are consistently earlier or
later than the ground truth. Through controlled experiments on timestamped
datasets, we find that temporal bias (i) is prevalent across datasets and
models, (ii) increases with audio length - even accumulating to tens of seconds
in extended recordings, and (iii) varies across event types and positions. We
quantify this effect with the Temporal Bias Index (TBI), measuring systematic
misalignment in predicted event timings, and complement it with a visualization
framework. Our findings highlight a fundamental limitation in current LALMs and
call for the development of temporally robust architectures.

Motivation: 现有分割模型虽然比启发式方法更鲁棒，但仍受限于监督学习目标，缺乏人类偏好对齐，这对自然实时翻译至关重要

Method: 使用直接偏好优化训练大语言模型来预测自然分割点，结合SeamlessM4T v2作为翻译骨干，在ACL 60/60语料库上评估

Result: 在三个语言对上的实验显示，DPO调优的LLM在分割准确率上超过SHAS，翻译质量和延迟也得到一致改善

Conclusion: 偏好调优的大语言模型有潜力超越现有预训练分割模型，推进自适应、人类对齐的同步口译

Abstract: Simultaneous speech translation requires accurate segmentation to balance
translation quality and latency. Recent studies such as SHAS have introduced
pretrained segmentation models, achieving stronger performance than heuristic
rules. However, segmentation models such as SHAS, though pretrained and more
robust than heuristic methods, are still constrained by supervised learning
objectives and do not incorporate human preference alignment, which is crucial
for natural real-time interpretation. In this work, we propose a segmentation
framework based on large language models (LLMs) trained with Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO). By leveraging preference alignment, our method enables LLMs
to predict natural segmentation points that better meet the demands of
real-time translation. We evaluate the system on the ACL 60/60 corpus across
three language pairs (English-Japanese, Chinese, German), using SeamlessM4T v2
as the translation backbone. Experimental results show that our DPO-tuned LLM
achieves higher segmentation accuracy than SHAS and yields consistent
improvements in translation quality (BLEU, COMET) as well as latency (Average
Lagging). Furthermore, our system benefits from IWSLT baselines for direct
comparison. These findings highlight the potential of preference-tuned LLMs to
surpass existing pretrained segmentation models and advance adaptive,
human-aligned simultaneous interpretation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估缺乏真实场景基础且未考虑危害严重性差异，如手术决策偏见与文本总结风格偏见不应同等对待。

Method: 提出HALF框架，将9个应用领域分为三个严重等级（严重、中等、轻微），使用五阶段流程评估模型偏见并按危害严重性加权结果。

Result: 评估8个LLM显示：(1)LLM在不同领域公平性不一致；(2)模型大小或性能不能保证公平性；(3)推理模型在医疗决策支持表现更好但在教育领域更差。

Conclusion: HALF揭示了先前基准测试成功与部署准备度之间的明显差距。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across high-impact
domains, from clinical decision support and legal analysis to hiring and
education, making fairness and bias evaluation before deployment critical.
However, existing evaluations lack grounding in real-world scenarios and do not
account for differences in harm severity, e.g., a biased decision in surgery
should not be weighed the same as a stylistic bias in text summarization. To
address this gap, we introduce HALF (Harm-Aware LLM Fairness), a
deployment-aligned framework that assesses model bias in realistic applications
and weighs the outcomes by harm severity. HALF organizes nine application
domains into three tiers (Severe, Moderate, Mild) using a five-stage pipeline.
Our evaluation results across eight LLMs show that (1) LLMs are not
consistently fair across domains, (2) model size or performance do not
guarantee fairness, and (3) reasoning models perform better in medical decision
support but worse in education. We conclude that HALF exposes a clear gap
between previous benchmarking success and deployment readiness.

Motivation: 探究大语言模型在微调过程中如何内化人类偏见，特别是Knobe效应这种道德判断偏见，并理解其具体机制。

Method: 在3个开源权重的大语言模型上进行层修补分析，通过将预训练模型的激活修补到微调模型的关键层来研究偏见定位。

Result: 发现Knobe效应偏见不仅在学习过程中形成，而且集中在特定层，仅对少数关键层进行激活修补就能完全消除这种偏见。

Conclusion: 大语言模型中的社会偏见可以被解释、定位和缓解，通过针对性干预无需重新训练模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to internalize human-like biases
during finetuning, yet the mechanisms by which these biases manifest remain
unclear. In this work, we investigated whether the well-known Knobe effect, a
moral bias in intentionality judgements, emerges in finetuned LLMs and whether
it can be traced back to specific components of the model. We conducted a
Layer-Patching analysis across 3 open-weights LLMs and demonstrated that the
bias is not only learned during finetuning but also localized in a specific set
of layers. Surprisingly, we found that patching activations from the
corresponding pretrained model into just a few critical layers is sufficient to
eliminate the effect. Our findings offer new evidence that social biases in
LLMs can be interpreted, localized, and mitigated through targeted
interventions, without the need for model retraining.

Motivation: LLMs在多文档问答任务中存在两个主要限制：长距离依赖建模困难，无法关注长文本中的关键信息；"迷失在中间"问题，难以处理长输入中间位置的信息。现有解决方案要么截断全局依赖，要么需要昂贵的微调，缺乏通用简单的解决方案。

Method: 提出双阶段自适应锐化(DSAS)方法，包含两个模块：上下文门控加权(CGW)模块通过层级注意力跟踪和位置感知加权评估段落相关性，缓解"迷失在中间"问题；互斥注意力抑制(RAS)模块通过抑制关键文本与无关文本之间的信息交换，增强对关键段落的关注。

Result: 在四个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，DSAS在主流LLMs（Llama、Qwen、Mistral、Deepseek）上均有效，在Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct和Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct上多文档问答任务平均F1分数提升4.2%。消融研究确认了CGW和RAS模块的必要贡献。

Conclusion: DSAS作为一种即插即用解决方案，无需架构修改或额外训练参数，有效解决了LLMs在多文档问答中的核心挑战，具有鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) show considerable promise across various
fields, they have notable limitations in handling multi-document question
answering (Multi-doc QA) tasks. The first challenge is long-range dependency
modeling, where LLMs struggle to focus on key information in long texts, which
weakens important semantic connections. Second, most LLMs suffer from the
''lost-in-the-middle'' issue, where they have difficulty processing information
in the middle of long inputs. Current solutions either truncate global
dependencies or demand costly finetuning, ultimately lacking a universal and
simple solution for these challenges. To resolve these limitations, we propose
Dual-Stage Adaptive Sharpening (DSAS) containing two modules. (i) The
Contextual Gate Weighting (CGW) module alleviates ''lost-in-the-middle'' by
assessing paragraph relevance through layer-wise attention tracking and
position-aware weighting. (ii) The Reciprocal Attention Suppression (RAS)
module enhances focus on critical paragraphs by suppressing information
exchange between key and irrelevant texts, thus mitigating the limitations in
long-range dependency modeling. Notably, DSAS functions as a plug-and-play
solution requiring no architectural modifications or extra training parameters.
Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate DSAS's efficacy across
mainstream LLMs (Llama, Qwen, Mistral, and Deepseek), with an average F1-score
improvement of 4.2% in Multi-doc QA tasks on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and
Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Ablation studies confirm the essential contributions of
both the CGW and RAS modules. In addition, detailed discussions in the Appendix
further validate the robustness and scalability of DSAS.

TL;DR: MedQA-Followup框架评估医学LLMs在多轮对话中的鲁棒性，发现模型在受到间接上下文干预时表现脆弱，准确率大幅下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估框架主要针对单轮问答，忽视了医学咨询中常见的多轮交互复杂性，如冲突输入、误导性上下文和权威影响。

Method: 通过MedQA-Followup框架，区分浅层鲁棒性（抵抗误导初始上下文）和深层鲁棒性（在答案被挑战时保持准确性），并引入间接-直接轴来分离上下文框架和明确建议。

Result: 模型在浅层扰动下表现尚可，但在多轮设置中表现出严重脆弱性，Claude Sonnet 4准确率从91.2%降至13.5%。间接上下文干预比直接建议更具破坏性。

Conclusion: 多轮鲁棒性是医学LLMs安全可靠部署的关键但未被充分探索的维度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transitioning into medical clinical
use, yet their reliability under realistic, multi-turn interactions remains
poorly understood. Existing evaluation frameworks typically assess single-turn
question answering under idealized conditions, overlooking the complexities of
medical consultations where conflicting input, misleading context, and
authority influence are common. We introduce MedQA-Followup, a framework for
systematically evaluating multi-turn robustness in medical question answering.
Our approach distinguishes between shallow robustness (resisting misleading
initial context) and deep robustness (maintaining accuracy when answers are
challenged across turns), while also introducing an indirect-direct axis that
separates contextual framing (indirect) from explicit suggestion (direct).
Using controlled interventions on the MedQA dataset, we evaluate five
state-of-the-art LLMs and find that while models perform reasonably well under
shallow perturbations, they exhibit severe vulnerabilities in multi-turn
settings, with accuracy dropping from 91.2% to as low as 13.5% for Claude
Sonnet 4. Counterintuitively, indirect, context-based interventions are often
more harmful than direct suggestions, yielding larger accuracy drops across
models and exposing a significant vulnerability for clinical deployment.
Further compounding analyses reveal model differences, with some showing
additional performance drops under repeated interventions while others
partially recovering or even improving. These findings highlight multi-turn
robustness as a critical but underexplored dimension for safe and reliable
deployment of medical LLMs.

### [125] [Chinese ModernBERT with Whole-Word Masking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12285)
*Zeyu Zhao,Ningtao Wang,Xing Fu,Yu Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chinese ModernBERT是一个从头训练的中文编码器，通过优化词汇表、训练策略和架构设计，在中文任务上实现了帕累托改进，在准确率、速度和内存效率方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的编码器改进主要基于英语，未能充分适应中文的独特分词和形态特征，需要专门为中文设计优化的预训练模型。

Method: 采用硬件感知的32k BPE词汇表、动态全词掩码训练、两阶段预训练扩展上下文长度，以及阻尼余弦学习率调度。

Result: 在CLUE基准测试中与强中文编码器竞争，在SimCLUE上达到0.505/0.537的相关性分数，超越Qwen-0.6B-embedding。

Conclusion: Chinese ModernBERT为中文NLP提供了可复现的解决方案，展示了通过精心设计的词汇表、训练策略和架构优化可以在中文任务上取得显著提升。

Abstract: Encoder-only Transformers have advanced along three axes -- architecture,
data, and systems -- yielding Pareto gains in accuracy, speed, and memory
efficiency. Yet these improvements have not fully transferred to Chinese, where
tokenization and morphology differ markedly from English. We introduce Chinese
ModernBERT, a from-scratch Chinese encoder that couples: (i) a hardware-aware
32k BPE vocabulary tailored to frequent Chinese affixes/compounds, lowering the
embedding budget; (ii) whole-word masking (WWM) with a dynamic masking
curriculum (30% -> 15%) to align task difficulty with training progress; (iii)
a two-stage pre-training pipeline that extends the native context from 1,024 to
8,192 tokens using RoPE and alternating local/global attention; and (iv) a
damped-cosine learning-rate schedule for stable long-horizon optimization. We
pre-train on ~1.2T Chinese tokens from CCI3-HQ, CCI4 (Chinese), and
Cosmopedia-Chinese. On CLUE, Chinese ModernBERT is competitive with strong
Chinese encoders under a unified fine-tuning protocol. Under bf16 it achieves
high long-sequence throughput while maintaining strong short-sequence speed,
reflecting benefits from budget allocation and attention design. To probe
retrieval-oriented quality, we add a small amount of open contrastive data:
fine-tuning on SimCLUE (~3M pairs) improves further when adding T2Ranking
(~2M), reaching 0.505 (Pearson) / 0.537 (Spearman) on the SimCLUE test set.
Under this open-data setting, Chinese ModernBERT surpasses Qwen-0.6B-embedding
on SimCLUE, suggesting a clear scaling path for STS with additional curated
pairs. We will release tokenizer and weights to facilitate reproducible
research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型的无监督自动化语法标注流程，用于大规模语料库的语法标注，在COHA语料库中实现了98%以上的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语料库快速扩张时人工标注成为方法学瓶颈的问题，探索利用大语言模型实现自动化语法标注的可能性。

Method: 采用四阶段工作流程：提示工程、先验评估、自动批量处理和后验验证，使用GPT-5通过OpenAI API进行标注。

Result: 在COHA语料库的143,933个句子中实现了98%以上的准确率，标注时间不到60小时。

Conclusion: 大语言模型能够以最小人工干预大规模执行数据准备任务，为基于语料库的研究开辟了新可能性，但实施需要考虑成本、许可和伦理问题。

Abstract: As natural language corpora expand at an unprecedented rate, manual
annotation remains a significant methodological bottleneck in corpus linguistic
work. We address this challenge by presenting a scalable, unsupervised pipeline
for automating grammatical annotation in voluminous corpora using large
language models (LLMs). Unlike previous supervised and iterative approaches,
our method employs a four-phase workflow: prompt engineering, pre-hoc
evaluation, automated batch processing, and post-hoc validation. We demonstrate
the pipeline's accessibility and effectiveness through a diachronic case study
of variation in the English consider construction. Using GPT-5 through the
OpenAI API, we annotate 143,933 sentences from the Corpus of Historical
American English (COHA) in under 60 hours, achieving 98%+ accuracy on two
sophisticated annotation procedures. Our results suggest that LLMs can perform
a range of data preparation tasks at scale with minimal human intervention,
opening new possibilities for corpus-based research, though implementation
requires attention to costs, licensing, and other ethical considerations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反仇恨言论生成方法存在可靠性不足或可扩展性差的问题，需要结合知识来生成更可信的反驳内容。

Method: 将反仇恨言论生成建模为知识驱动的文本生成过程，使用RAG框架整合包含32,792个文本的知识库，覆盖联合国和欧盟等权威来源。

Result: 在MultiTarget-CONAN数据集上评估，该框架在标准指标和人工评估中均优于标准LLM基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究可信和合理的反仇恨言论生成开辟了新途径，可应用于仇恨言论及其他领域。

Abstract: Counter-speech generation is at the core of many expert activities, such as
fact-checking and hate speech, to counter harmful content. Yet, existing work
treats counter-speech generation as pure text generation task, mainly based on
Large Language Models or NGO experts. These approaches show severe drawbacks
due to the limited reliability and coherence in the generated countering text,
and in scalability, respectively. To close this gap, we introduce a novel
framework to model counter-speech generation as knowledge-wise text generation
process. Our framework integrates advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines to ensure the generation of trustworthy counter-speech for 8 main
target groups identified in the hate speech literature, including women, people
of colour, persons with disabilities, migrants, Muslims, Jews, LGBT persons,
and other. We built a knowledge base over the United Nations Digital Library,
EUR-Lex and the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, comprising a total of 32,792
texts. We use the MultiTarget-CONAN dataset to empirically assess the quality
of the generated counter-speech, both through standard metrics (i.e., JudgeLM)
and a human evaluation. Results show that our framework outperforms standard
LLM baselines and competitive approach, on both assessments. The resulting
framework and the knowledge base pave the way for studying trustworthy and
sound counter-speech generation, in hate speech and beyond.

Motivation: 理解大型语言模型与人类大脑活动之间的对齐可以揭示语言处理的计算原理，特别是解决关于大脑对齐与下一个词预测关系的争议性研究问题。

Method: 引入细粒度输入归因方法，识别对大脑-LLM对齐最重要的具体词汇，并利用该方法分析BA和NWP的关系。

Result: 发现BA和NWP依赖于基本不同的词汇子集：NWP表现出近因和首因偏差，关注语法；而BA优先考虑语义和语篇层面信息，具有更针对性的近因效应。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了我们对LLM与人类语言处理关系的理解，突出了BA和NWP在特征依赖上的差异，归因方法可广泛应用于探索模型预测在各种语言处理任务中的认知相关性。

Abstract: Understanding the alignment between large language models (LLMs) and human
brain activity can reveal computational principles underlying language
processing. We introduce a fine-grained input attribution method to identify
the specific words most important for brain-LLM alignment, and leverage it to
study a contentious research question about brain-LLM alignment: the
relationship between brain alignment (BA) and next-word prediction (NWP). Our
findings reveal that BA and NWP rely on largely distinct word subsets: NWP
exhibits recency and primacy biases with a focus on syntax, while BA
prioritizes semantic and discourse-level information with a more targeted
recency effect. This work advances our understanding of how LLMs relate to
human language processing and highlights differences in feature reliance
between BA and NWP. Beyond this study, our attribution method can be broadly
applied to explore the cognitive relevance of model predictions in diverse
language processing tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoBiLE是一个基于卸载的MoE推理框架，通过混合大小专家机制，对不重要token使用半数专家加速推理，同时为重要token保留完整专家以保证质量，实现了1.6-1.72倍加速且精度损失可忽略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE模型的稀疏激活卸载策略受限于CPU-GPU互联带宽，预取方法训练开销大且在细粒度专家分割的现代MoE模型中效果不佳。

Method: 提出MoBiLE框架，采用混合大小专家机制，为不重要token减少专家数量以加速，为重要token保留完整专家；设计专用的回退和预取机制在大小专家间切换以提高内存效率。

Result: 在四种典型现代MoE架构和生成任务上评估，MoBiLE在消费级GPU系统上相比基线实现了1.60x到1.72x的加速，精度损失可忽略不计。

Conclusion: MoBiLE是一个即插即用的MoE推理框架，通过混合大小专家机制有效解决了MoE模型推理中的带宽瓶颈问题，在保持模型质量的同时显著提升了推理速度。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have recently demonstrated exceptional
performance across a diverse range of applications. The principle of sparse
activation in MoE models facilitates an offloading strategy, wherein active
experts are maintained in GPU HBM, while inactive experts are stored in CPU
DRAM. The efficacy of this approach, however, is fundamentally constrained by
the limited bandwidth of the CPU-GPU interconnect. To mitigate this bottleneck,
existing approaches have employed prefetching to accelerate MoE inference.
These methods attempt to predict and prefetch the required experts using
specially trained modules. Nevertheless, such techniques are often encumbered
by significant training overhead and have shown diminished effectiveness on
recent MoE models with fine-grained expert segmentation.
  In this paper, we propose MoBiLE, a plug-and-play offloading-based MoE
inference framework with \textit{mixture of big-little experts}. It reduces the
number of experts for unimportant tokens to half for acceleration while
maintaining full experts for important tokens to guarantee model quality.
Further, a dedicated fallback and prefetching mechanism is designed for
switching between little and big experts to improve memory efficiency. We
evaluate MoBiLE on four typical modern MoE architectures and challenging
generative tasks. Our results show that MoBiLE achieves a speedup of 1.60x to
1.72x compared to the baseline on a consumer GPU system, with negligible
degradation in accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在学术评审中存在偏见：系统性地给LLM生成的论文打高分，而对包含批判性陈述的人类论文持续低分，这源于LLM对语言特征的偏好和对批判性陈述的厌恶。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在学术工作流程中的深度整合，研究其作为评审者可能带来的公平性风险，特别是LLMs在研究与评审双重角色中的复杂互动。

Method: 通过模拟实验，设置研究代理生成和修订论文，评审代理评估提交的论文，并基于模拟结果进行人工标注分析。

Result: 发现LLM评审与人类判断存在显著偏差：LLM评审系统性地给LLM撰写的论文打高分，而对包含批判性陈述的人类论文持续低分，即使经过多次修订。

Conclusion: 在未充分谨慎的情况下将LLMs部署到同行评审周期中会带来风险和公平性问题，但LLM指导的修订确实能提升论文质量，对早期研究人员和低质量论文有潜在价值。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has inspired
researchers to integrate them extensively into the academic workflow,
potentially reshaping how research is practiced and reviewed. While previous
studies highlight the potential of LLMs in supporting research and peer review,
their dual roles in the academic workflow and the complex interplay between
research and review bring new risks that remain largely underexplored. In this
study, we focus on how the deep integration of LLMs into both peer-review and
research processes may influence scholarly fairness, examining the potential
risks of using LLMs as reviewers by simulation. This simulation incorporates a
research agent, which generates papers and revises, alongside a review agent,
which assesses the submissions. Based on the simulation results, we conduct
human annotations and identify pronounced misalignment between LLM-based
reviews and human judgments: (1) LLM reviewers systematically inflate scores
for LLM-authored papers, assigning them markedly higher scores than
human-authored ones; (2) LLM reviewers persistently underrate human-authored
papers with critical statements (e.g., risk, fairness), even after multiple
revisions. Our analysis reveals that these stem from two primary biases in LLM
reviewers: a linguistic feature bias favoring LLM-generated writing styles, and
an aversion toward critical statements. These results highlight the risks and
equity concerns posed to human authors and academic research if LLMs are
deployed in the peer review cycle without adequate caution. On the other hand,
revisions guided by LLM reviews yield quality gains in both LLM-based and human
evaluations, illustrating the potential of the LLMs-as-reviewers for
early-stage researchers and enhancing low-quality papers.

TL;DR: 对200多种语言的大规模跨语言评估显示，当前大型语言模型的标记化存在显著不平等：拉丁文字语言标记化效率高，而非拉丁文字和形态复杂语言的标记成本高出3-5倍，导致计算资源分配不均。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人工智能在语言多样性群体中公平访问的障碍，特别是标记化差异造成的计算不平等问题。

Method: 使用标准化实验框架，通过tiktoken库对200多种语言样本进行统一标记化处理，收集TPS和RTC等评估指标，并与英语基准进行比较。

Result: 发现系统性标记化差异：拉丁文字语言效率高，非拉丁和形态复杂语言标记膨胀严重，RTC比率通常高出3-5倍，导致计算成本增加和有效上下文利用减少。

Conclusion: 当前AI系统存在结构性不平等，低资源和非拉丁语言使用者面临不成比例的计算劣势，未来应开发语言感知的标记化策略和适应型词汇构建方法。

Abstract: Tokenization disparities pose a significant barrier to achieving equitable
access to artificial intelligence across linguistically diverse populations.
This study conducts a large-scale cross-linguistic evaluation of tokenization
efficiency in over 200 languages to systematically quantify computational
inequities in large language models (LLMs). Using a standardized experimental
framework, we applied consistent preprocessing and normalization protocols,
followed by uniform tokenization through the tiktoken library across all
language samples. Comprehensive tokenization statistics were collected using
established evaluation metrics, including Tokens Per Sentence (TPS) and
Relative Tokenization Cost (RTC), benchmarked against English baselines. Our
cross-linguistic analysis reveals substantial and systematic disparities:
Latin-script languages consistently exhibit higher tokenization efficiency,
while non-Latin and morphologically complex languages incur significantly
greater token inflation, often 3-5 times higher RTC ratios. These
inefficiencies translate into increased computational costs and reduced
effective context utilization for underrepresented languages. Overall, the
findings highlight structural inequities in current AI systems, where speakers
of low-resource and non-Latin languages face disproportionate computational
disadvantages. Future research should prioritize the development of
linguistically informed tokenization strategies and adaptive vocabulary
construction methods that incorporate typological diversity, ensuring more
inclusive and computationally equitable multilingual AI systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PRoH是一个动态规划和推理框架，通过上下文感知规划、结构化问题分解和实体加权重叠引导的推理路径检索，解决了知识超图检索增强生成中的静态规划和非自适应检索问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于知识超图的检索增强生成方法存在三个主要限制：静态检索规划、非自适应检索执行以及对知识超图结构和语义的浅层使用，这些限制了它们在多跳问答中的有效性。

Method: PRoH包含三个核心创新：(1)上下文感知规划模块，通过勾勒局部知识超图邻域来指导结构化的推理计划生成；(2)结构化问题分解过程，将子问题组织为动态演化的有向无环图，实现自适应多轨迹探索；(3)实体加权重叠引导的推理路径检索算法，优先考虑语义连贯的超边遍历。

Result: 在多个领域的实验中，PRoH实现了最先进的性能，平均F1分数比之前的SOTA模型HyperGraphRAG高出19.73%，生成评估分数高出8.41%，同时在长距离多跳推理任务中保持强大的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PRoH通过动态规划和结构化推理有效克服了现有知识超图检索增强生成方法的局限性，在多跳问答任务中表现出卓越的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Knowledge Hypergraphs (KHs) have recently emerged as a knowledge
representation for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), offering a paradigm to
model multi-entity relations into a structured form. However, existing KH-based
RAG methods suffer from three major limitations: static retrieval planning,
non-adaptive retrieval execution, and superficial use of KH structure and
semantics, which constrain their ability to perform effective multi-hop
question answering. To overcome these limitations, we propose PRoH, a dynamic
Planning and Reasoning over Knowledge Hypergraphs framework. PRoH incorporates
three core innovations: (i) a context-aware planning module that sketches the
local KH neighborhood to guide structurally grounded reasoning plan generation;
(ii) a structured question decomposition process that organizes subquestions as
a dynamically evolving Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to enable adaptive,
multi-trajectory exploration; and (iii) an Entity-Weighted Overlap (EWO)-guided
reasoning path retrieval algorithm that prioritizes semantically coherent
hyperedge traversals. Experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that PRoH
achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the prior SOTA model
HyperGraphRAG by an average of 19.73% in F1 and 8.41% in Generation Evaluation
(G-E) score, while maintaining strong robustness in long-range multi-hop
reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出CLEAR框架，通过细粒度句子级知识分解、隐藏状态探测定位冲突知识以及冲突感知微调，解决RAG系统中模型响应与检索证据不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统存在不忠实问题，模型响应与检索上下文证据相矛盾。现有方法将LLM视为黑盒，忽视了LLM内部如何整合检索证据与参数记忆，特别是在知识冲突情况下的机制。

Method: 1) 将上下文分解为细粒度句子级知识；2) 使用隐藏状态探测定位冲突知识；3) 引入冲突感知微调指导模型准确整合检索证据。

Result: 在三个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，CLEAR显著提高了准确性和上下文忠实度，在不同冲突条件下始终优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: CLEAR框架通过深入理解LLM内部知识整合机制，有效解决了RAG系统的忠实性问题，为提升模型的事实准确性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to
enhance the factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RAG
systems often suffer from an unfaithfulness issue, where the model's response
contradicts evidence from the retrieved context. Existing approaches to
improving contextual faithfulness largely rely on external interventions, such
as prompt engineering, decoding constraints, or reward-based fine-tuning. These
works treat the LLM as a black box and overlook a crucial question: how does
the LLM internally integrate retrieved evidence with its parametric memory,
particularly under knowledge conflicts? To address this gap, we conduct a
probing-based analysis of hidden-state representations in LLMs and observe
three findings: knowledge integration occurs hierarchically, conflicts manifest
as latent signals at the sentence level, and irrelevant context is often
amplified when aligned with parametric knowledge. Building on these findings,
we propose CLEAR (Conflict-Localized and Enhanced Attention for RAG), a
framework that (i) decomposes context into fine-grained sentence-level
knowledge, (ii) employs hidden-state probing to localize conflicting knowledge,
and (iii) introduces conflict-aware fine-tuning to guide the model to
accurately integrate retrieved evidence. Extensive experiments across three
benchmarks demonstrate that CLEAR substantially improves both accuracy and
contextual faithfulness, consistently outperforming strong baselines under
diverse conflict conditions. The related resources are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM的语言能力是否接近人类水平，以及模型表现是由语言结构复杂度还是训练数据量主导。

Method: 使用多语言Wug测试，在四种语言（加泰罗尼亚语、英语、希腊语、西班牙语）上测试六个模型，并与人类表现对比。

Result: 模型能泛化形态学过程到未见词汇，准确率接近人类水平，但模式更符合社区规模和数据可用性，而非结构复杂度。

Conclusion: 模型行为主要由语言资源丰富度驱动，而非对语法复杂度的敏感性，仅表面类似人类语言能力。

Abstract: The linguistic abilities of Large Language Models are a matter of ongoing
debate. This study contributes to this discussion by investigating model
performance in a morphological generalization task that involves novel words.
Using a multilingual adaptation of the Wug Test, six models were tested across
four partially unrelated languages (Catalan, English, Greek, and Spanish) and
compared with human speakers. The aim is to determine whether model accuracy
approximates human competence and whether it is shaped primarily by linguistic
complexity or by the quantity of available training data. Consistent with
previous research, the results show that the models are able to generalize
morphological processes to unseen words with human-like accuracy. However,
accuracy patterns align more closely with community size and data availability
than with structural complexity, refining earlier claims in the literature. In
particular, languages with larger speaker communities and stronger digital
representation, such as Spanish and English, revealed higher accuracy than
less-resourced ones like Catalan and Greek. Overall, our findings suggest that
model behavior is mainly driven by the richness of linguistic resources rather
than by sensitivity to grammatical complexity, reflecting a form of performance
that resembles human linguistic competence only superficially.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate high-dimensional embeddings that
capture rich semantic and syntactic information. However, high-dimensional
embeddings exacerbate computational complexity and storage requirements,
thereby hindering practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel training framework named Sequential Matryoshka Embedding Compression

during dimension pruning, and the Selectable Cross-batch Memory (S-XBM) module
to enhance unsupervised learning between high- and low-dimensional embeddings.
Experiments on image, text, and multimodal datasets demonstrate that SMEC
achieves significant dimensionality reduction while maintaining performance.
For instance, on the BEIR dataset, our approach improves the performance of
compressed LLM2Vec embeddings (256 dimensions) by 1.1 points and 2.7 points
compared to the Matryoshka-Adaptor and Search-Adaptor models, respectively.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了第一个个性化机器生成文本检测基准，揭示了现有检测器在个性化设置中的性能下降问题，并提出了一种预测检测器性能变化的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型能够生成模仿个人风格的文本，这增加了身份冒充的风险，但目前缺乏针对个性化机器生成文本检测的研究。

Method: 构建个性化文本检测基准数据集，提出基于特征反转陷阱的检测器性能预测方法，通过识别潜在特征方向来评估检测器依赖度。

Result: 实验结果显示在个性化设置中，部分最先进的检测器性能显著下降，提出的预测方法与实际性能差距有85%的相关性。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了个性化文本检测的挑战，提出的方法能有效预测检测器性能变化，鼓励进一步研究个性化文本检测。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have grown more powerful in language generation,
producing fluent text and even imitating personal style. Yet, this ability also
heightens the risk of identity impersonation. To the best of our knowledge, no
prior work has examined personalized machine-generated text (MGT) detection. In
this paper, we introduce \dataset, the first benchmark for evaluating detector
robustness in personalized settings, built from literary and blog texts paired
with their LLM-generated imitations. Our experimental results demonstrate large
performance gaps across detectors in personalized settings: some
state-of-the-art models suffer significant drops. We attribute this limitation
to the \textit{feature-inversion trap}, where features that are discriminative
in general domains become inverted and misleading when applied to personalized
text. Based on this finding, we propose \method, a simple and reliable way to
predict detector performance changes in personalized settings. \method
identifies latent directions corresponding to inverted features and constructs
probe datasets that differ primarily along these features to evaluate detector
dependence. Our experiments show that \method can accurately predict both the
direction and the magnitude of post-transfer changes, showing 85\% correlation
with the actual performance gaps. We hope that this work will encourage further
research on personalized text detection.

TL;DR: 该论文将测试时扩展技术从数学和编程领域转移到LeWiDi-2025任务，评估标注分歧。实验发现两种基准方法能持续提升LLM性能，但Best-of-N方法无效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时扩展技术此前仅限于有可验证正确答案的领域，作者希望将其扩展到评估标注分歧的LeWiDi任务中。

Method: 使用三种测试时扩展方法：模型平均、多数投票和Best-of-N采样，在LeWiDi-2025任务上进行实验。

Result: 两种基准方法（模型平均和多数投票）在LeWiDi任务上持续提升LLM性能，但Best-of-N方法无效。

Conclusion: Best-of-N方法目前无法从数学领域成功转移到LeWiDi任务，作者分析了这种差距的潜在原因。

Abstract: Test-time scaling is a family of techniques to improve LLM outputs at
inference time by performing extra computation. To the best of our knowledge,
test-time scaling has been limited to domains with verifiably correct answers,
like mathematics and coding. We transfer test-time scaling to the LeWiDi-2025
tasks to evaluate annotation disagreements. We experiment with three test-time
scaling methods: two benchmark algorithms (Model Averaging and Majority
Voting), and a Best-of-N sampling method. The two benchmark methods improve LLM
performance consistently on the LeWiDi tasks, but the Best-of-N method does
not. Our experiments suggest that the Best-of-N method does not currently
transfer from mathematics to LeWiDi tasks, and we analyze potential reasons for
this gap.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解视觉语言模型在处理典型和异常实例时如何在语用先验（输入相关）和语义先验（概念一般性）之间进行权衡。

Method: 引入VISaGE评估数据集，包含典型和异常图像，通过精心平衡的实验设计分析模型行为。

Result: 当图像与文本不匹配时，概念理解显著下降；语用先验的影响强于语义先验。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型在处理个体实例时更依赖语用先验，当输入不匹配时概念理解会受损。

Abstract: While Vision Language Models (VLMs) learn conceptual representations, in the
form of generalized knowledge, during training, they are typically used to
analyze individual instances. When evaluation instances are atypical, this
paradigm results in tension between two priors in the model. The first is a
pragmatic prior that the textual and visual input are both relevant, arising
from VLM finetuning on congruent inputs; the second is a semantic prior that
the conceptual representation is generally true for instances of the category.
In order to understand how VLMs trade off these priors, we introduce a new
evaluation dataset, VISaGE, consisting of both typical and exceptional images.
In carefully balanced experiments, we show that conceptual understanding
degrades when the assumption of congruency underlying the pragmatic prior is
violated with incongruent images. This effect is stronger than the effect of
the semantic prior when querying about individual instances.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Faithful Uncertainty Tuning (FUT)方法，通过微调让LLM能够忠实地表达不确定性，而不改变其答案分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在表达不确定性方面存在忠实性问题：重复查询会产生不同答案，但生成的响应通常没有或没有正确反映这种变异性，这传达了关于LLM知识不确定状态的不忠实信息。

Method: 通过增强模型样本与不确定性修饰语（如'可能'或'很可能'）来构建训练数据，这些修饰语与样本一致性对齐，只需要模型和一组提示即可，无需额外监督。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上的开放域问答评估显示，FUT显著减少了忠实性差距，同时保持了问答准确性并引入了最小的语义分布偏移。

Conclusion: FUT是一种简单有效的方法，可以教导LLM忠实地传达不确定性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often miscommunicate their uncertainty: repeated
queries can produce divergent answers, yet generated responses are typically
unhedged or hedged in ways that do not reflect this variability. This conveys
unfaithful information about the uncertain state of the LLMs' knowledge,
creating a faithfulness gap that affects even strong LLMs. We introduce
Faithful Uncertainty Tuning (FUT): a fine-tuning approach that teaches
instruction-tuned LLMs to express uncertainty faithfully without altering their
underlying answer distribution. We construct training data by augmenting model
samples with uncertainty hedges (i.e. verbal cues such as 'possibly' or
'likely') aligned with sample consistency, requiring no supervision beyond the
model and a set of prompts. We evaluate FUT on open-domain question answering
(QA) across multiple models and datasets. Our results show that FUT
substantially reduces the faithfulness gap, while preserving QA accuracy and
introducing minimal semantic distribution shift. Further analyses demonstrate
robustness across decoding strategies, choice of hedgers, and other forms of
uncertainty expression (i.e. numerical). These findings establish FUT as a
simple and effective way to teach LLMs to communicate uncertainty faithfully.

Motivation: 现有机器生成文本检测方法存在泛化能力有限、易受改写攻击、缺乏可解释性等问题，特别是在面对风格多样性和人机混合创作时表现不佳。

Method: 使用组合特征提取器量化风格差异，联合建模离散风格指标和基于语义嵌入的连续风格表示，在统一表示空间中捕捉人类与LLM输出的风格级差异。

Result: 在五个不同领域的实验中，StyleDecipher在域内检测准确率持续达到最先进水平，跨域评估中比现有基线提升高达36.30%，且对抗扰动和混合人机内容具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 风格信号为区分机器生成文本提供了可解释的证据，StyleDecipher框架实现了准确、可解释且领域无关的检测，无需访问模型内部或标记片段。

Abstract: With the increasing integration of large language models (LLMs) into
open-domain writing, detecting machine-generated text has become a critical
task for ensuring content authenticity and trust. Existing approaches rely on
statistical discrepancies or model-specific heuristics to distinguish between
LLM-generated and human-written text. However, these methods struggle in
real-world scenarios due to limited generalization, vulnerability to
paraphrasing, and lack of explainability, particularly when facing stylistic
diversity or hybrid human-AI authorship. In this work, we propose
StyleDecipher, a robust and explainable detection framework that revisits
LLM-generated text detection using combined feature extractors to quantify
stylistic differences. By jointly modeling discrete stylistic indicators and
continuous stylistic representations derived from semantic embeddings,
StyleDecipher captures distinctive style-level divergences between human and
LLM outputs within a unified representation space. This framework enables
accurate, explainable, and domain-agnostic detection without requiring access
to model internals or labeled segments. Extensive experiments across five
diverse domains, including news, code, essays, reviews, and academic abstracts,
demonstrate that StyleDecipher consistently achieves state-of-the-art in-domain
accuracy. Moreover, in cross-domain evaluations, it surpasses existing
baselines by up to 36.30%, while maintaining robustness against adversarial
perturbations and mixed human-AI content. Further qualitative and quantitative
analysis confirms that stylistic signals provide explainable evidence for
distinguishing machine-generated text. Our source code can be accessed at

Result: 微调后7B和2B模型在学术翻译质量上分别平均提升6.1和12.4 d-BLEU点，从英语翻译时在通用领域长上下文翻译提升达24.9%，最佳模型在学术翻译领域超越所有对比模型。

Abstract: We present ACADATA, a high-quality parallel dataset for academic translation,
that consists of two subsets: ACAD-TRAIN, which contains approximately 1.5
million author-generated paragraph pairs across 96 language directions and
ACAD-BENCH, a curated evaluation set of almost 6,000 translations covering 12
directions. To validate its utility, we fine-tune two Large Language Models
(LLMs) on ACAD-TRAIN and benchmark them on ACAD-BENCH against specialized
machine-translation systems, general-purpose, open-weight LLMs, and several
large-scale proprietary models. Experimental results demonstrate that
fine-tuning on ACAD-TRAIN leads to improvements in academic translation quality
by +6.1 and +12.4 d-BLEU points on average for 7B and 2B models respectively,
while also improving long-context translation in a general domain by up to
24.9% when translating out of English. The fine-tuned top-performing model
surpasses the best propietary and open-weight models on academic translation
domain. By releasing ACAD-TRAIN, ACAD-BENCH and the fine-tuned models, we
provide the community with a valuable resource to advance research in academic

Motivation: 大型语言模型对提示设计高度敏感，现有COSTAR框架在小型本地优化模型上表现不一致，特别是在需要更多指导或约束输出的任务中。

Method: 在COSTAR框架（Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, Response）基础上增加'Answer'组件，形成COSTAR-A框架，并通过受控的提示-输出评估测试其在小型（最多80亿参数）微调模型上的表现。

Result: COSTAR-A能够提升本地化LLMs在某些任务中的输出结构和决策性，但效果因模型和用例而异。Llama 3.1-8B模型在使用COSTAR-A提示时相比单独使用COSTAR表现出性能改进。

Conclusion: COSTAR-A作为一个提示框架具有适应性和可扩展性，特别适用于资源受限硬件上的计算高效AI部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to prompt design, and
making optimized prompting techniques is crucial for generating consistent,
high-quality outputs. In this study, we introduce COSTAR-A, a novel prompt
engineering framework that enhances the existing COSTAR method, which stands
for Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, and Response, by adding the
'Answer' component at the end. We demonstrate that while the original COSTAR
framework improves prompt clarity and aligns outputs for larger LLMs, its
performance is less consistent with smaller, locally optimized models,
particularly in tasks that require more directive or constrained outputs.
Through a series of controlled prompt-output assessments with smaller (at most
8 billion parameters), fine-tuned models, we found that COSTAR-A can enhance
the output structure and decisiveness of localized LLMs for certain tasks,
although its effectiveness varies across models and use cases. Notably, the
Llama 3.1-8B model exhibited performance improvements when prompted with
COSTAR-A compared to COSTAR alone. These findings emphasize the adaptability
and scalability of COSTAR-A as a prompting framework, particularly in
computationally efficient AI deployments on resource-constrained hardware.

Motivation: 当前SFT+RLVR范式需要昂贵的人工标注推理轨迹，论文旨在研究如何在不影响推理性能的前提下大幅降低标注成本。

Method: 提出PARO框架，识别模式化推理任务，让LLM根据任务特定的推理模式自动生成原理，无需人工标注推理轨迹。

Result: PARO生成的原理在SFT+RLVR中达到与10倍规模人工标注相当的性能，证明大规模人工标注可被LLM自动标注替代。

Conclusion: 对于模式化推理任务，推理模式而非原理数量或质量是关键性能决定因素，LLM自动标注可有效替代昂贵的人工标注。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning
capabilities under the widely adopted SFT+RLVR paradigm, which first performs
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on human-annotated reasoning trajectories
(rationales) to establish initial reasoning behaviors, then applies
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize the model
using verifiable signals without golden rationales. However, annotating
high-quality rationales for the SFT stage remains prohibitively expensive. This
paper investigates when and how rationale annotation costs can be substantially
reduced without compromising reasoning performance. We identify a broad class
of problems, termed patterned reasoning tasks, where reasoning follows a fixed,
procedural strategy consistent across instances. Although instances vary in
content such as domain knowledge, factual information, or numeric values, the
solution derives from applying a shared reasoning pattern. We argue that the
success of SFT+RLVR on such tasks primarily stems from its ability to enable
models to internalize these reasoning patterns. Using numerical semantic
matching as a representative task, we provide both causal and behavioral
evidence showing that reasoning patterns rather than the quantity or quality of
rationales are the key determinant of performance. Building on these insights,
we propose Pattern-Aware LLMs as Rationale AnnOtators (PARO), a simple yet
effective framework that enables LLMs to generate rationales aligned with
task-specific reasoning patterns without requiring human rationale annotations.
Experiments show that PARO-generated rationales achieve comparable SFT+RLVR
performance to human rationales that are 10 times larger. These results suggest
that large-scale human rationale annotations can be replaced with LLM-based
automatic annotations requiring only limited human supervision over reasoning
patterns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs存在校准问题：在创意任务中输出过于同质化，在事实任务中产生多样化但不正确的回答。这两种失败模式都可以通过生成空间大小(GSS)的概念来统一理解和解决。

Method: 提出GSS概念和GSSBench基准测试套件，包含具有真实GSS关系的提示对，用于评估不同指标并理解模型与期望行为的差异。特别关注基于模型内部状态的幻觉检测指标。

Result: 发现幻觉检测指标（特别是EigenScore）在仅使用模型内部状态的情况下，持续优于标准多样性和不确定性量化指标，并能提供对模型内部任务表征的可解释见解。

Conclusion: GSS概念统一了LLMs的两种失败模式，并提供了检测提示歧义、解释推理模型行为、引导高质量多样化输出的实用方法，为模型校准和输出控制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Different open-ended generation tasks require different degrees of output
diversity. However, current LLMs are often miscalibrated. They collapse to
overly homogeneous outputs for creative tasks and hallucinate diverse but
incorrect responses for factual tasks. We argue that these two failure modes
are unified by, and can both be addressed by, the notion of effective
generation space size (GSS) -- the set of semantically distinct outputs a model
considers for a prompt. We present GSSBench, a task suite of prompt pairs with
ground-truth GSS relationships to assess different metrics and understand where
models diverge from desired behavior. We find that hallucination detection
metrics, particularly EigenScore, consistently outperform standard diversity
and uncertainty quantification metrics, while using only model internals,
providing interpretable insights into a model's internal task representations.
We demonstrate three applications of GSS: (1) detecting prompt ambiguity and
predicting clarification questions for better grounding, (2) interpreting
overthinking and underthinking in reasoning models, and (3) steering models to
expand their generation space to yield high-quality and diverse outputs.

Conclusion: Omni-Detective能有效生成高质量详细描述，Omni-Cloze为全模态详细感知提供了稳定可靠的评估方法，推动了细粒度多模态理解的发展。

Abstract: Fine-grained perception of multimodal information is critical for advancing
human-AI interaction. With recent progress in audio-visual technologies, Omni
Language Models (OLMs), capable of processing audio and video signals in
parallel, have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving richer
understanding and reasoning. However, their capacity to capture and describe
fine-grained details remains limited explored. In this work, we present a
systematic and comprehensive investigation of omni detailed perception from the
perspectives of the data pipeline, models, and benchmark. We first identify an
inherent "co-growth" between detail and hallucination in current OLMs. To
address this, we propose Omni-Detective, an agentic data generation pipeline
integrating tool-calling, to autonomously produce highly detailed yet minimally
hallucinatory multimodal data. Based on the data generated with Omni-Detective,
we train two captioning models: Audio-Captioner for audio-only detailed
perception, and Omni-Captioner for audio-visual detailed perception. Under the
cascade evaluation protocol, Audio-Captioner achieves the best performance on
MMAU and MMAR among all open-source models, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash and
delivering performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Pro. On existing detailed
captioning benchmarks, Omni-Captioner sets a new state-of-the-art on VDC and
achieves the best trade-off between detail and hallucination on the
video-SALMONN 2 testset. Given the absence of a dedicated benchmark for omni
detailed perception, we design Omni-Cloze, a novel cloze-style evaluation for
detailed audio, visual, and audio-visual captioning that ensures stable,
efficient, and reliable assessment. Experimental results and analysis
demonstrate the effectiveness of Omni-Detective in generating high-quality
detailed captions, as well as the superiority of Omni-Cloze in evaluating such
detailed captions.

Conclusion: 语言模型确实存在对类型学合理语法结构的偏好，这种偏好在处理更复杂、更接近自然语言的结构时依然存在。

Abstract: Whether language models (LMs) have inductive biases that favor typologically
frequent grammatical properties over rare, implausible ones has been
investigated, typically using artificial languages (ALs) (White and Cotterell,
2021; Kuribayashi et al., 2024). In this paper, we extend these works from two
perspectives. First, we extend their context-free AL formalization by adopting
Generalized Categorial Grammar (GCG) (Wood, 2014), which allows ALs to cover
attested but previously overlooked constructions, such as unbounded dependency
and mildly context-sensitive structures. Second, our evaluation focuses more on
the generalization ability of LMs to process unseen longer test sentences.
Thus, our ALs better capture features of natural languages and our experimental
paradigm leads to clearer conclusions -- typologically plausible word orders
tend to be easier for LMs to productively generalize.

Abstract: Evaluating the naturalness of dialogue in language models (LMs) is not
trivial: notions of 'naturalness' vary, and scalable quantitative metrics
remain limited. This study leverages the linguistic notion of 'at-issueness' to
assess dialogue naturalness and introduces a new method: Divide, Generate,
Recombine, and Compare (DGRC). DGRC (i) divides a dialogue as a prompt, (ii)
generates continuations for subparts using LMs, (iii) recombines the dialogue
and continuations, and (iv) compares the likelihoods of the recombined
sequences. This approach mitigates bias in linguistic analyses of LMs and
enables systematic testing of discourse-sensitive behavior. Applying DGRC, we
find that LMs prefer to continue dialogue on at-issue content, with this effect
enhanced in instruct-tuned models. They also reduce their at-issue preference
when relevant cues (e.g., "Hey, wait a minute") are present. Although
instruct-tuning does not further amplify this modulation, the pattern reflects
a hallmark of successful dialogue dynamics.

Abstract: Linguistic commentary on LLMs, heavily influenced by the theoretical
frameworks of de Saussure and Chomsky, is often speculative and unproductive.
Critics challenge whether LLMs can legitimately model language, citing the need
for "deep structure" or "grounding" to achieve an idealized linguistic
"competence." We argue for a radical shift in perspective towards the
empiricist principles of Witold Ma\'nczak, a prominent general and historical
linguist. He defines language not as a "system of signs" or a "computational
system of the brain" but as the totality of all that is said and written. Above
all, he identifies frequency of use of particular language elements as
language's primary governing principle. Using his framework, we challenge prior
critiques of LLMs and provide a constructive guide for designing, evaluating,

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) process every token through all layers of a

insufficient flexibility for harder ones that need deeper reasoning.
Adaptive-depth methods can improve efficiency, but prior approaches rely on
costly inference-time search, architectural changes, or large-scale retraining,
and in practice often degrade accuracy despite efficiency gains. We introduce
Dr.LLM, Dynamic routing of Layers for LLMs, a retrofittable framework that
equips pretrained models with lightweight per-layer routers deciding to skip,
execute, or repeat a block. Routers are trained with explicit supervision:
using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we derive high-quality layer
configurations that preserve or improve accuracy under a compute budget. Our
design, windowed pooling for stable routing, focal loss with class balancing,
and bottleneck MLP routers, ensures robustness under class imbalance and long
sequences. On ARC (logic) and DART (math), Dr.LLM improves accuracy by up to
+3.4%p while saving 5 layers per example on average. Routers generalize to
out-of-domain tasks (MMLU, GSM8k, AIME, TruthfulQA, SQuADv2, GPQA, PIQA,
AGIEval) with only 0.85% accuracy drop while retaining efficiency, and
outperform prior routing methods by up to +7.7%p. Overall, Dr.LLM shows that
explicitly supervised routers retrofit frozen LLMs for budget-aware,
accuracy-driven inference without altering base weights.

### [151] [Think as a Doctor: An Interpretable AI Approach for ICU Mortality Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11745)
*Qingwen Li,Xiaohang Zhao,Xiao Han,Hailiang Huang,Lanjuan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProtoDoctor是一个用于ICU死亡率预测的新型框架，通过原型学习实现内在可解释性，同时整合了ICU决策实践的三个关键要素：临床病程识别、人口统计学异质性和预后意识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU死亡率预测不仅需要预测准确性，还需要可解释性来建立临床信任和满足监管标准。传统方法主要关注人口统计学异质性，而忽略了临床病程识别和预后意识。

Method: ProtoDoctor包含两个关键创新模块：预后临床病程识别模块（通过原型学习识别临床病程，并使用新的正则化机制实现预后意识）和人口统计学异质性识别模块（通过队列特定原型和风险调整建模人口统计学异质性）。

Result: 广泛的实证评估表明，ProtoDoctor在预测准确性方面优于最先进的基线方法。人工评估进一步证实其解释在ICU实践中更具临床意义、可信度和适用性。

Conclusion: ProtoDoctor成功整合了ICU决策实践的所有三个关键要素，不仅提高了预测准确性，还提供了更具临床意义的解释，有望在ICU实践中得到应用。

Abstract: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) mortality prediction, which estimates a patient's
mortality status at discharge using EHRs collected early in an ICU admission,
is vital in critical care. For this task, predictive accuracy alone is
insufficient; interpretability is equally essential for building clinical trust
and meeting regulatory standards, a topic that has attracted significant
attention in information system research. Accordingly, an ideal solution should
enable intrinsic interpretability and align its reasoning with three key
elements of the ICU decision-making practices: clinical course identification,
demographic heterogeneity, and prognostication awareness. However, conventional
approaches largely focus on demographic heterogeneity, overlooking clinical
course identification and prognostication awareness. Recent prototype learning
methods address clinical course identification, yet the integration of the
other elements into such frameworks remains underexplored. To address these
gaps, we propose ProtoDoctor, a novel ICU mortality prediction framework that
delivers intrinsic interpretability while integrating all three elements of the
ICU decision-making practices into its reasoning process. Methodologically,
ProtoDoctor features two key innovations: the Prognostic Clinical Course
Identification module and the Demographic Heterogeneity Recognition module. The
former enables the identification of clinical courses via prototype learning
and achieves prognostication awareness using a novel regularization mechanism.
The latter models demographic heterogeneity through cohort-specific prototypes
and risk adjustments. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that
ProtoDoctor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.
Human evaluations further confirm that its interpretations are more clinically
meaningful, trustworthy, and applicable in ICU practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出GAR框架，通过生成对抗强化学习联合训练问题生成器和求解器，实现任务难度与证明能力对齐的隐式课程学习，提升训练效率和复杂定理证明能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定问题集进行昂贵的在线强化学习或专家迭代，导致训练效率低下且难以处理复杂问题。

Method: GAR框架在对抗循环中联合训练问题生成器和求解器，引入隐式课程学习机制，使任务难度与证明者能力动态匹配。

Result: 在MiniF2F-Test基准上平均相对提升4.20%，ProofNet-Test上pass@32从22.58%提升至25.81%。

Conclusion: GAR建立了可验证环境下问题生成与求解协同进化的一般强化学习范式。

Abstract: Solving math problems through verifiable languages such as Lean has
significantly impacted both the mathematics and computer science communities.
Current state-of-the-art models are often trained with expensive online
Reinforcement Learning (RL) or expert iteration. However, these approaches rely
on fixed problem sets, which causes inefficient training and limits the model
to tackle complex problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose GAR:
Generative Adversarial Reinforcement learning, a comprehensive RL training
framework that jointly trains the problem composer and solver in an adversarial
loop. GAR introduces an implicit curriculum learning mechanism, which aligns
task difficulty with the prover's evolving capability. It thereby improves the
training efficiency and enables stronger performance of proving advanced
theorems. Experiments show that with GAR training, Goedel-Prover-V2-8B and
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieve an average relative improvement in pass@32 of
4.20% on MiniF2F-Test benchmark, while DeepSeek-Prover-V2's pass@32 on
ProofNet-Test increases from 22.58% to 25.81%. Beyond formal proving, GAR
establishes a general RL paradigm for co-evolution of problem generation and
solving under verifiable environments.

Motivation: 节点级异常检测面临结构模式和特征分布多样性的挑战，在欺诈检测、网络安全和推荐系统等应用中至关重要。现有方法难以捕捉复杂的异常模式。

Method: 使用欧几里得和双曲GNN分别处理原始特征和结构特征（随机游走和度），通过多图自编码器框架和对比学习目标来对齐两个空间的嵌入表示。

Result: 在四个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，Janus始终优于浅层和深层基线方法，证明了结合多种几何表示能有效识别图中复杂异常。

Conclusion: 联合利用欧几里得和双曲几何表示为图异常检测提供了鲁棒有效的方法，能够识别细微和复杂的异常模式。

Abstract: Node-level anomaly detection (NAD) is challenging due to diverse structural
patterns and feature distributions. As such, NAD is a critical task with
several applications which range from fraud detection, cybersecurity, to
recommendation systems. We introduce Janus, a framework that jointly leverages
Euclidean and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks to capture complementary aspects
of node representations. Each node is described by two views, composed by the
original features and structural features derived from random walks and
degrees, then embedded into Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces. A multi
Graph-Autoencoder framework, equipped with a contrastive learning objective as
regularization term, aligns the embeddings across the Euclidean and Hyperbolic
spaces, highlighting nodes whose views are difficult to reconcile and are thus
likely anomalous. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that Janus
consistently outperforms shallow and deep baselines, empirically demonstrating
that combining multiple geometric representations provides a robust and
effective approach for identifying subtle and complex anomalies in graphs.

TL;DR: 本文提出软约束薛定谔桥问题(SCSBP)，通过用惩罚函数替代硬终端约束来解决经典SBP在实践中的不稳定性问题，为生成式AI提供了更灵活稳健的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典薛定谔桥问题(SBP)在生成式AI中应用时，硬终端约束会导致高维或数据稀缺情况下的不稳定性，需要更灵活的约束处理方式。

Method: 采用软约束薛定谔桥问题框架，将终端约束替换为一般惩罚函数，建立McKean-Vlasov型随机控制公式，使用Doob h-变换表示、薛定谔势稳定性、Gamma收敛和新型不动点论证等方法。

Result: 证明了所有惩罚水平下最优解的存在性，并证明当惩罚增加时，控制和价值函数以线性速率收敛到经典SBP，首次为软约束桥提供了定量收敛保证。

Conclusion: 软约束薛定谔桥不仅提供了经典SBP的稳健替代方案，还揭示了惩罚正则化如何支持鲁棒的生成建模、微调和迁移学习。

Abstract: Generative AI can be framed as the problem of learning a model that maps
simple reference measures into complex data distributions, and it has recently
found a strong connection to the classical theory of the Schr\"odinger bridge
problems (SBPs) due partly to their common nature of interpolating between
prescribed marginals via entropy-regularized stochastic dynamics. However, the
classical SBP enforces hard terminal constraints, which often leads to
instability in practical implementations, especially in high-dimensional or
data-scarce regimes. To address this challenge, we follow the idea of the
so-called soft-constrained Schr\"odinger bridge problem (SCSBP), in which the
terminal constraint is replaced by a general penalty function. This relaxation
leads to a more flexible stochastic control formulation of McKean-Vlasov type.
  We establish the existence of optimal solutions for all penalty levels and
prove that, as the penalty grows, both the controls and value functions
converge to those of the classical SBP at a linear rate. Our analysis builds on
Doob's h-transform representations, the stability results of Schr\"odinger
potentials, Gamma-convergence, and a novel fixed-point argument that couples an
optimization problem over the space of measures with an auxiliary entropic
optimal transport problem. These results not only provide the first
quantitative convergence guarantees for soft-constrained bridges but also shed
light on how penalty regularization enables robust generative modeling,
fine-tuning, and transfer learning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的零阶近似方法来估计训练数据对模型预测行为的影响，该方法仅需中间检查点的损失值和检查点本身，计算成本远低于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解训练数据如何影响模型预测行为对于分析和改进机器学习系统至关重要，但现有方法在大模型上要么精度不足要么计算成本过高。

Method: 使用零阶近似方法，仅依赖中间检查点的损失值和检查点本身来估计数据影响，无需梯度或逆Hessian计算。

Result: 该方法在计算效率上显著优于现有方法，在估计自影响方面精度更高，在估计训练-测试影响方面精度相当或更好。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模语言模型提供了可扩展且实用的训练数据分析工具，即使对于不可微损失函数也适用。

Abstract: A critical aspect of analyzing and improving modern machine learning systems
lies in understanding how individual training examples influence a model's
predictive behavior. Estimating this influence enables critical applications,
including data selection and model debugging; in particular, self-influence,
which quantifies the influence of a training point on itself, has found many
uses in data quality assessment and outlier detection. Existing methods for
measuring data influence, however, are often impractical for large models due
to low accuracy or prohibitive computational costs: most approaches either
provide poor approximations or rely on gradients and inverse-Hessian
computations that remain challenging to scale. In this work, we introduce a
highly efficient zeroth-order approximation for estimating the influence of
training data that requires only a fraction of the time and memory footprint of
prior methods. Notably, our method relies solely on loss values of intermediate
checkpoints on the training and test data, along with the checkpoints
themselves, making it broadly applicable even when the loss function of
interest is non-differentiable. Beyond its computational efficiency, our
approach achieves superior accuracy in estimating self-influence and comparable
or improved accuracy in estimating train-test influence for fine-tuned large
language models, enabling scalable and practical analysis of how training data
shapes model behavior.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Boundary Guidance方法，通过强化学习微调生成模型，使其远离安全分类器的决策边界，从而同时提高输出的安全性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过微调生成模型来降低被安全分类器过滤的概率，但这种方法往往使模型产生靠近分类器决策边界的样本，导致假阳性和假阴性增加。

Method: 使用强化学习进行微调，明确引导生成远离分类器的边界区域，避免产生边界附近的模糊样本。

Result: 在越狱和模糊提示基准测试中，Boundary Guidance方法通过LLM-as-a-Judge评估显示，同时提高了输出的安全性和实用性。

Conclusion: 该方法在不同模型规模和奖励设计下的综合消融实验证明了其鲁棒性，为生成模型的安全部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly paired with safety classifiers that filter
harmful or undesirable outputs. A common strategy is to fine-tune the generator
to reduce the probability of being filtered, but this can be suboptimal: it
often pushes the model toward producing samples near the classifier's decision
boundary, increasing both false positives and false negatives. We propose
Boundary Guidance, a reinforcement learning fine-tuning method that explicitly
steers generation away from the classifier's margin. On a benchmark of
jailbreak and ambiguous prompts, Boundary Guidance improves both the safety and
the utility of outputs, as judged by LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. Comprehensive
ablations across model scales and reward designs demonstrate the robustness of
our approach.

TL;DR: WaveletDiff是一种新颖的扩散模型框架，直接在时间序列的小波系数上训练，利用其多分辨率结构，在多个领域的数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列生成模型局限于时域或频域，难以复现真实世界时间序列固有的多尺度结构，且大型高质量时间序列数据集稀缺。

Method: 结合每层分解的专用transformer和跨层注意力机制，通过自适应门控实现时频尺度间的选择性信息交换，并基于Parseval定理加入能量保持约束。

Result: 在六个真实世界数据集上，WaveletDiff在五个不同性能指标上始终优于最先进的时域和频域生成方法，判别分数和Context-FID分数平均比次优基线小3倍。

Conclusion: WaveletDiff通过在小波域训练扩散模型，有效利用了时间序列的多分辨率结构，在生成质量上显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Time series are ubiquitous in many applications that involve forecasting,
classification and causal inference tasks, such as healthcare, finance, audio
signal processing and climate sciences. Still, large, high-quality time series
datasets remain scarce. Synthetic generation can address this limitation;
however, current models confined either to the time or frequency domains
struggle to reproduce the inherently multi-scaled structure of real-world time
series. We introduce WaveletDiff, a novel framework that trains diffusion
models directly on wavelet coefficients to exploit the inherent
multi-resolution structure of time series data. The model combines dedicated
transformers for each decomposition level with cross-level attention mechanisms
that enable selective information exchange between temporal and frequency
scales through adaptive gating. It also incorporates energy preservation
constraints for individual levels based on Parseval's theorem to preserve
spectral fidelity throughout the diffusion process. Comprehensive tests across
six real-world datasets from energy, finance, and neuroscience domains
demonstrate that WaveletDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
time-domain and frequency-domain generative methods on both short and long time
series across five diverse performance metrics. For example, WaveletDiff
achieves discriminative scores and Context-FID scores that are $3\times$
smaller on average than the second-best baseline across all datasets.

Motivation: 语言模型在持续预训练中面临学习新能力与避免灾难性遗忘现有知识之间的基本权衡，而现有研究对计算约束下平衡任务性能和知识保留的最佳重放比例理解不足。

Method: 使用bAbI推理任务作为目标，应用合成数据生成技术，系统评估不同总token预算和重放比例配置，分析它们对任务掌握和通用知识保留的影响。

Result: 实验揭示了平衡任务特定性能与通用知识保留的最佳配置，发现基于计算预算选择适当重放比例可以显著降低训练成本同时实现强大的任务适应。

Conclusion: 研究提供了基于实证的重放比例选择指南，使实践者能够在计算预算约束下有效平衡任务适应性和知识保留，显著降低训练成本。

Abstract: Adapting language models to new tasks through continued pretraining faces a
fundamental trade-off: models must learn new capabilities while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting of existing knowledge. While prior work has studied
synthetic data generation techniques, the optimal replay ratios for balancing
task performance and knowledge retention under computational constraints remain
poorly understood. We present a comprehensive empirical study investigating the
interplay between replay ratio configuration and computational budget when
adapting language models to new tasks. Using the bAbI reasoning tasks as our
target objective, we apply synthetic data generation and systematically
evaluate different total token budgets and replay ratio configurations. We
analyze their effects on both task mastery and general knowledge retention. Our
experiments reveal an optimal configuration that balances task-specific
performance with general knowledge retention. Based on our findings, we provide
empirically-grounded guidelines for selecting replay ratios based on
computational budget, enabling practitioners to achieve strong task adaptation
with significantly reduced training costs.

Motivation: 开源视觉语言模型的进步为理解复杂多模态现象（如讽刺）提供了新机会，需要系统评估这些模型在检测多模态讽刺和生成解释方面的能力。

Method: 使用零样本、单样本和少样本提示策略，在三个基准讽刺数据集（Muse、MMSD2.0和SarcNet）上评估BLIP2、InstructBLIP等7种先进VLMs。

Result: 当前模型在二元讽刺检测方面取得中等成功，但在生成高质量解释方面表现不足，需要任务特定微调才能达到理想效果。

Conclusion: 虽然现有VLMs在多模态讽刺检测方面有一定能力，但在生成人类质量解释方面仍有局限，需要进一步改进和任务特定优化。

Abstract: Recent advances in open-source vision-language models (VLMs) offer new
opportunities for understanding complex and subjective multimodal phenomena
such as sarcasm. In this work, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art VLMs - BLIP2,
InstructBLIP, OpenFlamingo, LLaVA, PaliGemma, Gemma3, and Qwen-VL - on their
ability to detect multimodal sarcasm using zero-, one-, and few-shot prompting.
Furthermore, we evaluate the models' capabilities in generating explanations to
sarcastic instances. We evaluate the capabilities of VLMs on three benchmark
sarcasm datasets (Muse, MMSD2.0, and SarcNet). Our primary objectives are
twofold: (1) to quantify each model's performance in detecting sarcastic
image-caption pairs, and (2) to assess their ability to generate human-quality
explanations that highlight the visual-textual incongruities driving sarcasm.
Our results indicate that, while current models achieve moderate success in
binary sarcasm detection, they are still not able to generate high-quality
explanations without task-specific finetuning.

Conclusion: 将参与者行为随时间建模并纳入预测模型能够提高性能指标预测的性能。

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) is a key task in Process Mining that aims
to predict future behavior, outcomes, or performance indicators. Accurate
prediction of the latter is critical for proactive decision-making. Given that
processes are often resource-driven, understanding and incorporating actor
behavior in forecasting is crucial. Although existing research has incorporated
aspects of actor behavior, its role as a time-varying signal in PPM remains
limited. This study investigates whether incorporating actor behavior
information, modeled as time series, can improve the predictive performance of
throughput time (TT) forecasting models. Using real-life event logs, we
construct multivariate time series that include TT alongside actor-centric
features, i.e., actor involvement, the frequency of continuation, interruption,
and handover behaviors, and the duration of these behaviors. We train and
compare several models to study the benefits of adding actor behavior. The
results show that actor-enriched models consistently outperform baseline
models, which only include TT features, in terms of RMSE, MAE, and R2. These
findings demonstrate that modeling actor behavior over time and incorporating
this information into forecasting models enhances performance indicator
predictions.

Motivation: 解决高斯过程回归训练过程中计算成本高的问题，特别是大规模数据集下的时间和空间复杂度挑战。

Method: 使用预处理共轭梯度法加速线性求解，利用输入数据聚类识别协方差矩阵的块对角结构并构造低秩近似，采用数值梯度优化超参数避免反向传播，利用CUDA Toolkit在GPU上并行化训练。

Result: 与现有最佳GPU-based GPR实现相比，nuGPR将总训练时间减少最多2倍，峰值内存消耗减少最多12倍。

Conclusion: nuGPR框架通过数值线性代数技术的综合应用，有效解决了GPR训练的计算瓶颈问题，为大规模数据集上的高斯过程回归提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is an important type of supervised machine
learning model with inherent uncertainty measure in its predictions. We propose
a new framework, nuGPR, to address the well-known challenge of high computation
cost associated with GPR training. Our framework includes several ideas from
numerical linear algebra to reduce the amount of computation in key steps of
GPR, and we combine them to establish an end-to-end training algorithm.
Specifically, we leverage the preconditioned conjugate gradient method to
accelerate the convergence of the linear solves required in GPR. We exploit
clustering in the input data to identify block-diagonal structure of the
covariance matrix and subsequently construct low-rank approximations of the
off-diagonal blocks. These enhancements significantly reduce the time and space
complexity of our computations. In addition, unlike other frameworks that rely
on exact differentiation, we employ numerical gradients to optimize the
hyperparameters of our GPR model, further reducing the training cost by
eliminating the need for backpropagation. Lastly, we leverage the CUDA Toolkit
to efficiently parallelize the training procedure on NVIDIA GPUs. As a result,
nuGPR reduces total training time by up to 2x and peak memory consumption by up
to 12x on various synthetic and real-world datasets when compared to the best
existing GPU-based GPR implementation.

TL;DR: 提出一种新颖的知识图嵌入方法，通过双模型架构整合显式声明的负陈述，提升链接预测和三元组分类任务的性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有知识图嵌入方法大多基于封闭世界假设，将缺失三元组视为假，这与现实世界知识图的开放世界假设不符。显式负陈述有助于区分假三元组和未知三元组，但很少被包含在知识图中且常被忽略。

Method: 采用双模型架构，两个嵌入模型并行训练：一个处理正陈述，另一个处理负陈述。训练过程中，每个模型通过破坏正样本并选择另一个模型评分最高的候选作为负样本。

Result: 在通用和领域特定知识图上的广泛实验表明，该方法在链接预测和三元组分类任务上优于最先进的嵌入模型。

Conclusion: 将有意义负知识整合到嵌入学习中能显著提升预测性能，验证了负知识在知识图嵌入中的价值。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs represent information as structured triples and serve as the
backbone for a wide range of applications, including question answering, link
prediction, and recommendation systems. A prominent line of research for
exploring knowledge graphs involves graph embedding methods, where entities and
relations are represented in low-dimensional vector spaces that capture
underlying semantics and structure. However, most existing methods rely on
assumptions such as the Closed World Assumption or Local Closed World
Assumption, treating missing triples as false. This contrasts with the Open
World Assumption underlying many real-world knowledge graphs. Furthermore,
while explicitly stated negative statements can help distinguish between false
and unknown triples, they are rarely included in knowledge graphs and are often
overlooked during embedding training.
  In this work, we introduce a novel approach that integrates explicitly
declared negative statements into the knowledge embedding learning process. Our
approach employs a dual-model architecture, where two embedding models are
trained in parallel, one on positive statements and the other on negative
statements. During training, each model generates negative samples by
corrupting positive samples and selecting the most likely candidates as scored
by the other model. The proposed approach is evaluated on both general-purpose
and domain-specific knowledge graphs, with a focus on link prediction and
triple classification tasks. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach improves predictive performance over state-of-the-art embedding
models, demonstrating the value of integrating meaningful negative knowledge
into embedding learning.

Abstract: The Transformer, a highly expressive architecture for sequence modeling, has
recently been adapted to solve sequential decision-making, most notably through
the Decision Transformer (DT), which learns policies by conditioning on desired
returns. Yet, the adversarial robustness of reinforcement learning methods
based on sequence modeling remains largely unexplored. Here we introduce the
Conservative Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer (CART), to our knowledge
the first framework designed to enhance the robustness of DT in adversarial
stochastic games. We formulate the interaction between the protagonist and the
adversary at each stage as a stage game, where the payoff is defined as the
expected maximum value over subsequent states, thereby explicitly incorporating
stochastic state transitions. By conditioning Transformer policies on the NashQ
value derived from these stage games, CART generates policy that are
simultaneously less exploitable (adversarially robust) and conservative to
transition uncertainty. Empirically, CART achieves more accurate minimax value
estimation and consistently attains superior worst-case returns across a range
of adversarial stochastic games.

TL;DR: AdaRL是一个双层优化框架，通过自适应调整策略的秩来平衡偏差-方差权衡，避免嵌套最小-最大优化，在模型不确定性下实现高效稳健的强化学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稳健强化学习方法依赖计算昂贵的嵌套最小-最大优化，产生过于保守的策略，需要一种能平衡稳健性和效率的替代方法。

Method: 提出AdaRL双层优化框架：下层在固定秩约束下进行策略优化，使用Wasserstein球内采样的动态模型；上层自适应调整秩，将策略参数投影到低秩流形上。

Result: 在MuJoCo连续控制基准测试中，AdaRL不仅优于固定秩基线和最先进的稳健RL方法，还能收敛到任务的内在秩。

Conclusion: 自适应低秩策略表示为模型不确定性下的稳健强化学习提供了高效且原理性的替代方案。

Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning (Robust RL) seeks to handle epistemic
uncertainty in environment dynamics, but existing approaches often rely on
nested min--max optimization, which is computationally expensive and yields
overly conservative policies. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Rank Representation
(AdaRL)}, a bi-level optimization framework that improves robustness by
aligning policy complexity with the intrinsic dimension of the task. At the
lower level, AdaRL performs policy optimization under fixed-rank constraints
with dynamics sampled from a Wasserstein ball around a centroid model. At the
upper level, it adaptively adjusts the rank to balance the bias--variance
trade-off, projecting policy parameters onto a low-rank manifold. This design
avoids solving adversarial worst-case dynamics while ensuring robustness
without over-parameterization. Empirical results on MuJoCo continuous control
benchmarks demonstrate that AdaRL not only consistently outperforms fixed-rank
baselines (e.g., SAC) and state-of-the-art robust RL methods (e.g., RNAC,
Parseval), but also converges toward the intrinsic rank of the underlying
tasks. These results highlight that adaptive low-rank policy representations
provide an efficient and principled alternative for robust RL under model
uncertainty.

Result: 实验结果表明，同时建模个人事件和关系事件的模型性能更好，但现有方法仍有较大改进空间。

Conclusion: 需要开发能够统一建模个人事件和关系事件的方法，现有方法在这方面还有很大提升潜力。

Abstract: User event modeling plays a central role in many machine learning
applications, with use cases spanning e-commerce, social media, finance,
cybersecurity, and other domains. User events can be broadly categorized into
personal events, which involve individual actions, and relational events, which
involve interactions between two users. These two types of events are typically
modeled separately, using sequence-based methods for personal events and
graph-based methods for relational events. Despite the need to capture both
event types in real-world systems, prior work has rarely considered them
together. This is often due to the convenient simplification that user behavior
can be adequately represented by a single formalization, either as a sequence
or a graph. To address this gap, there is a need for public datasets and
prediction tasks that explicitly incorporate both personal and relational
events. In this work, we introduce a collection of such datasets, propose a
unified formalization, and empirically show that models benefit from
incorporating both event types. Our results also indicate that current methods
leave a notable room for improvements. We release these resources to support
further research in unified user event modeling and encourage progress in this
direction.

Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病和额颞叶痴呆等痴呆症在EEG中表现出重叠的电生理特征，现有基于EEG的方法受限于全频带分析，难以精确区分痴呆亚型和严重程度阶段。

Method: VMoGE采用多粒度transformer提取四个频带的多尺度时间模式，然后使用高斯马尔可夫随机场先验的变分图卷积编码器，通过结构化变分推理和自适应门控将神经专业化与生理相关的EEG频带联系起来。

Conclusion: VMoGE为痴呆症的全面诊断和监测提供了有效的EEG生物标志物发现方法。

Abstract: Dementia disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal
dementia (FTD) exhibit overlapping electrophysiological signatures in EEG that
challenge accurate diagnosis. Existing EEG-based methods are limited by
full-band frequency analysis that hinders precise differentiation of dementia
subtypes and severity stages. We propose a variational mixture of graph neural
experts (VMoGE) that integrates frequency-specific biomarker identification
with structured variational inference for enhanced dementia diagnosis and
staging. VMoGE employs a multi-granularity transformer to extract multi-scale
temporal patterns across four frequency bands, followed by a variational graph
convolutional encoder using Gaussian Markov Random Field priors. Through
structured variational inference and adaptive gating, VMoGE links neural
specialization to physiologically meaningful EEG frequency bands. Evaluated on
two diverse datasets for both subtype classification and severity staging,
VMoGE achieves superior performance with AUC improvements of +4% to +10% over
state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, VMoGE provides interpretable insights
through expert weights that correlate with clinical indicators and spatial
patterns aligned with neuropathological signatures, facilitating EEG biomarker
discovery for comprehensive dementia diagnosis and monitoring.

TL;DR: Locaris是一个基于解码器的大型语言模型，用于室内Wi-Fi定位，能够直接处理原始Wi-Fi信号数据，无需预校准，在异构环境中实现亚米级精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统室内Wi-Fi定位方法对环境动态、信道传播特性和硬件异构性高度敏感，需要大量人工校准且性能容易退化。

Method: 将每个接入点测量视为一个token，使用解码器LLM直接学习从原始Wi-Fi信号到设备位置的映射，通过微调适应不同数据集。

Result: Locaris在各种Wi-Fi遥测类型上达到或超越现有技术，仅需少量校准点即可在新设备和部署场景中保持高精度，支持缺失AP的鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: 紧凑型LLM可作为无校准回归模型用于室内定位，在大规模部署中提供可扩展和鲁棒的跨环境性能。

Abstract: Indoor Wi-Fi positioning remains a challenging problem due to the high
sensitivity of radio signals to environmental dynamics, channel propagation
characteristics, and hardware heterogeneity. Conventional fingerprinting and
model-based approaches typically require labor-intensive calibration and suffer
rapid performance degradation when devices, channel or deployment conditions
change. In this paper, we introduce Locaris, a decoder-only large language
model (LLM) for indoor localization. Locaris treats each access point (AP)
measurement as a token, enabling the ingestion of raw Wi-Fi telemetry without
pre-processing. By fine-tuning its LLM on different Wi-Fi datasets, Locaris
learns a lightweight and generalizable mapping from raw signals directly to
device location. Our experimental study comparing Locaris with state-of-the-art
methods consistently shows that Locaris matches or surpasses existing
techniques for various types of telemetry. Our results demonstrate that compact
LLMs can serve as calibration-free regression models for indoor localization,
offering scalable and robust cross-environment performance in heterogeneous
Wi-Fi deployments. Few-shot adaptation experiments, using only a handful of
calibration points per device, further show that Locaris maintains high
accuracy when applied to previously unseen devices and deployment scenarios.
This yields sub-meter accuracy with just a few hundred samples, robust
performance under missing APs and supports any and all available telemetry. Our
findings highlight the practical viability of Locaris for indoor positioning in
the real-world scenarios, particularly in large-scale deployments where
extensive calibration is infeasible.

Motivation: 现有RestartQ-UCB算法存在两个核心问题：完全遗忘（重启后丢失所有环境信息）和预定重启（不考虑策略与当前环境动态的不兼容性）。

Method: 引入了三种重启方法：部分重启、自适应重启和选择性重启，用于改进RestartQ-UCB和RANDOMIZEDQ算法。

Result: 在多种不同环境中实现了接近最优的实证性能，相比RestartQ-UCB将动态遗憾降低了高达91%。

Conclusion: 提出的三种重启范式能有效解决非平稳强化学习中的重启设计问题，显著提升算法性能。

Abstract: In this work, we propose three efficient restart paradigms for model-free
non-stationary reinforcement learning (RL). We identify two core issues with
the restart design of Mao et al. (2022)'s RestartQ-UCB algorithm: (1) complete
forgetting, where all the information learned about an environment is lost
after a restart, and (2) scheduled restarts, in which restarts occur only at
predefined timings, regardless of the incompatibility of the policy with the
current environment dynamics. We introduce three approaches, which we call
partial, adaptive, and selective restarts to modify the algorithms RestartQ-UCB
and RANDOMIZEDQ (Wang et al., 2025). We find near-optimal empirical performance
in multiple different environments, decreasing dynamic regret by up to $91$%
relative to RestartQ-UCB.

Abstract: We show that \emph{efficient Turing computability} at any fixed input/output
precision implies the existence of \emph{compositionally sparse}
(bounded-fan-in, polynomial-size) DAG representations and of corresponding
neural approximants achieving the target precision. Concretely: if
$f:[0,1]^d\to\R^m$ is computable in time polynomial in the bit-depths, then for
every pair of precisions $(n,m_{\mathrm{out}})$ there exists a bounded-fan-in
Boolean circuit of size and depth $\poly(n+m_{\mathrm{out}})$ computing the
discretized map; replacing each gate by a constant-size neural emulator yields
a deep network of size/depth $\poly(n+m_{\mathrm{out}})$ that achieves accuracy
$\varepsilon=2^{-m_{\mathrm{out}}}$. We also relate these constructions to
compositional approximation rates

Motivation: 传统VAE使用KL散度惩罚来鼓励潜在空间匹配因子化高斯先验，但作者发现这种机制不可靠，无法在聚合后验分布上强制执行目标分布。

Method: 提出了可编程先验框架，基于最大均值差异(MMD)，允许显式塑造潜在空间，并引入了无监督的潜在可预测性评分(LPS)来量化纠缠程度。

Conclusion: 这项工作为表示工程提供了基础工具，为模型可识别性和因果推理开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Learning disentangled representations, where distinct factors of variation
are captured by independent latent variables, is a central goal in machine
learning. The dominant approach has been the Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
framework, which uses a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalty to encourage
the latent space to match a factorized Gaussian prior. In this work, however,
we provide direct evidence that this KL-based regularizer is an unreliable
mechanism, consistently failing to enforce the target distribution on the
aggregate posterior. We validate this and quantify the resulting entanglement
using our novel, unsupervised Latent Predictability Score (LPS). To address
this failure, we introduce the Programmable Prior Framework, a method built on
the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). Our framework allows practitioners to
explicitly sculpt the latent space, achieving state-of-the-art mutual
independence on complex datasets like CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet without the
common reconstruction trade-off. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this
programmability can be used to engineer sophisticated priors that improve
alignment with semantically meaningful features. Ultimately, our work provides
a foundational tool for representation engineering, opening new avenues for
model identifiability and causal reasoning.

Motivation: 现代连续时间生成模型通常采用V形传输，即每个样本沿着近乎直线的轨迹从先验分布移动到数据分布，忽略了共享结构。作者旨在开发能够捕捉层次结构的生成模型。

Method: 引入Y形生成流，基于具有次线性指数（0到1之间）的新型速度驱动传输成本。这种凹性依赖奖励联合和快速的质量移动。在可扩展的神经ODE训练目标中实例化这一思想。

Result: 在合成、图像和生物学数据集上，Y流能够恢复层次感知结构，在分布指标上优于强流基线方法，并且用更少的积分步骤达到目标。

Conclusion: Y形生成流通过共享路径和分支结构，有效改进了连续时间生成模型的性能，能够更好地捕捉数据中的层次结构。

Abstract: Modern continuous-time generative models often induce V-shaped transport:
each sample travels independently along nearly straight trajectories from prior
to data, overlooking shared structure. We introduce Y-shaped generative flows,
which move probability mass together along shared pathways before branching to
target-specific endpoints. Our formulation is based on novel velocity-powered
transport cost with a sublinear exponent (between zero and one). this concave
dependence rewards joint and fast mass movement. Practically, we instantiate
the idea in a scalable neural ODE training objective. On synthetic, image, and
biology datasets, Y-flows recover hierarchy-aware structure, improve
distributional metrics over strong flow-based baselines, and reach targets with
fewer integration steps.

Motivation: 扩散模型的预训练过程存在明显的学习速度阶段差异，但之前的后训练加速方法完全忽略了这一现象。

Method: 采用自适应剪枝机制：中间快速学习阶段采用保守剪枝以保留关键特征，早期和后期慢速学习阶段采用更激进的剪枝策略，使剪枝与预训练学习速度变化保持一致。

Result: 在DiT和SDXL上的广泛实验表明，该方法在采样速度上实现显著提升，且不损害输出质量，大幅超越之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为更高效和鲁棒的无训练扩散加速提供了新视角，首次明确地将扩散预训练的内在学习速度变化与加速采样过程相协调。

Abstract: Diffusion models are renowned for their generative capabilities, yet their
pretraining processes exhibit distinct phases of learning speed that have been
entirely overlooked in prior post-training acceleration efforts in the
community. In this study, we introduce a novel framework called MosaicDiff that
aligns diffusion pretraining dynamics with post-training sampling acceleration
via trajectory-aware structural pruning. Our approach leverages the observation
that the middle, fast-learning stage of diffusion pretraining requires more
conservative pruning to preserve critical model features, while the early and
later, slow-learning stages benefit from a more aggressive pruning strategy.
This adaptive pruning mechanism is the first to explicitly mirror the inherent
learning speed variations of diffusion pretraining, thereby harmonizing the
model's inner training dynamics with its accelerated sampling process.
Extensive experiments on DiT and SDXL demonstrate that our method achieves
significant speed-ups in sampling without compromising output quality,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins, also
providing a new viewpoint for more efficient and robust training-free diffusion
acceleration.

Conclusion: QLENS为跨领域洞察提供了基础，有助于更广泛地理解Transformer模型。

Abstract: In natural language processing, current methods for understanding
Transformers are successful at identifying intermediate predictions during a
model's inference. However, these approaches function as limited diagnostic
checkpoints, lacking a mathematical framework for mechanistically modeling how
each layer facilitates transitions between these evolving states. This
interpretability gap and past successes of interdisciplinary outlooks inspire
us to turn to physics in search of a descriptive mathematical framework for
Transformers. We observe that language models are intrinsically probabilistic,
an attribute that is echoed in the core postulates of quantum mechanics. This
parallel inspires us to translate insights from this discipline to that of
natural language processing. Towards this objective, we propose QLENS a novel
attempt to develop a physics-based perspective on the Transformer generation
process. Under QLENS, a Transformer is studied by converting its latent
activations into a state vector in a Hilbert space derived from the model's
output units. This state subsequently evolves through hidden layers -
reformulated as unitary operators and analogously defined Hamiltonians - during
inference. The model's final probability distribution is obtained by applying
the Born rule to the end state using a specific measurement operator. To
demonstrate QLENS's potential, we conduct a proof-of-concept by probing a toy
Transformer to investigate the influence of individual layers in a model's
prediction trajectory. We present our work as a foundation for cross-domain
insights to be leveraged towards a broader understanding of Transformers.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于偏好的视觉语言模型微调很脆弱，因为琐碎的负样本会注入无信息梯度，导致训练不稳定。

Method: 第一阶段：使用温和负样本进行监督微调，通过低权重平滑监督来正则化基础策略并抑制过度自信；第二阶段：应用DPO目标，其中负项通过基于模型在负样本上的平均token对数概率计算的冷却权重进行缩放。

Result: 在多种VLM任务中，CW-DPO比仅SFT和普通DPO提供了更稳定的优化、更好的校准和更高的成对胜率，同时收敛步数更少。

Conclusion: 在冷却偏好之前平滑学习动态是稳健VLM对齐的简单通用原则。

Abstract: Preference-based finetuning of vision--language models (VLMs) is brittle:
trivially wrong negatives inject uninformative gradients that destabilize
training. We recast alignment as \textbf{learning-dynamics--aware optimization}
and introduce \textbf{Cooling-Weighted DPO (CW-DPO)}, a two-stage recipe that
explicitly models and exploits the training trajectory. \textbf{Stage 1}
performs supervised finetuning with \textbf{gentle negatives}:
\textbf{low-weight smoothed supervision} that regularizes the base policy and
curbs overconfidence without explicit penalties. \textbf{Stage 2} applies a DPO
objective in which the \textbf{negative term is scaled by a cooling weight}
computed from the model's \textbf{average token log-probability} on each
negative, suppressing uninformative gradients from easy or off-distribution
samples while preserving signal from hard negatives. In practice, we emphasize
\textbf{on-policy negatives} and allow \textbf{mixed negatives} by blending a
controllable fraction of dataset negatives to maintain contrast freshness.
Throughout, we instrument training with $\Delta\!\log p$ probes on positives
and negatives as first-class signals for early stopping, curriculum design, and
failure diagnosis. Across diverse VLM tasks, CW-DPO yields \textbf{more stable
optimization}, \textbf{better calibration}, and \textbf{higher pairwise
win-rates} than SFT-only and vanilla DPO, while \textbf{converging in fewer
steps}. Ablations isolate the \textbf{cooling-weight mechanism} as the primary
driver of these gains and show complementary benefits from mixing on-policy and
dataset negatives. Taken together, our results show that \textbf{smoothing
learning dynamics before cooling preferences} is a simple, general principle
for robust VLM alignment.

Abstract: Despite the striking successes of deep neural networks trained with
gradient-based optimization, these methods differ fundamentally from their
biological counterparts. This gap raises key questions about how nature
achieves robust, sample-efficient learning at minimal energy costs and solves
the credit-assignment problem without backpropagation. We take a step toward
bridging contemporary AI and computational neuroscience by studying how neural
dynamics can support fully local, distributed learning that scales to simple
machine-learning benchmarks. Using tools from statistical mechanics, we
identify conditions for the emergence of robust dynamical attractors in random
asymmetric recurrent networks. We derive a closed-form expression for the
number of fixed points as a function of self-coupling strength, and we reveal a
phase transition in their structure: below a critical self-coupling, isolated
fixed points coexist with exponentially many narrow clusters showing the
overlap-gap property; above it, subdominant yet dense and extensive clusters
appear. These fixed points become accessible, including to a simple
asynchronous dynamical rule, after an algorithm-dependent self-coupling
threshold. Building on this analysis, we propose a biologically plausible
algorithm for supervised learning with any binary recurrent network. Inputs are
mapped to fixed points of the dynamics, by relaxing under transient external
stimuli and stabilizing the resulting configurations via local plasticity. We
show that our algorithm can learn an entangled version of MNIST, leverages
depth to develop hierarchical representations and increase hetero-association
capacity, and is applicable to several architectures. Finally, we highlight the
strong connection between algorithm performance and the unveiled phase
transition, and we suggest a cortex-inspired alternative to self-couplings for
its emergence.

Conclusion: 研究结果质疑了损失函数充满局部最小值的传统观点，揭示了非线性离散化的几何特性和损失函数景观中驻点分布的新见解。

Abstract: Second-order methods are emerging as promising alternatives to standard
first-order optimizers such as gradient descent and ADAM for training neural
networks. Though the advantages of including curvature information in computing
optimization steps have been celebrated in the scientific machine learning
literature, the only second-order methods that have been studied are
quasi-Newton, meaning that the Hessian matrix of the objective function is
approximated. Though one would expect only to gain from using the true Hessian
in place of its approximation, we show that neural network training reliably
fails when relying on exact curvature information. The failure modes provide
insight both into the geometry of nonlinear discretizations as well as the
distribution of stationary points in the loss landscape, leading us to question
the conventional wisdom that the loss landscape is replete with local minima.

Abstract: Mamba, a recently proposed linear-time sequence model, has attracted
significant attention for its computational efficiency and strong empirical
performance. However, a rigorous theoretical understanding of its underlying
mechanisms remains limited. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of
Mamba's in-context learning (ICL) capability by focusing on tasks defined by
low-dimensional nonlinear target functions. Specifically, we study in-context
learning of a single-index model $y \approx g_*(\langle \boldsymbol{\beta},

$\boldsymbol{\beta}$, referred to as feature. We prove that Mamba, pretrained
by gradient-based methods, can achieve efficient ICL via test-time feature
learning, extracting the relevant direction directly from context examples.
Consequently, we establish a test-time sample complexity that improves upon
linear Transformers -- analyzed to behave like kernel methods -- and is
comparable to nonlinear Transformers, which have been shown to surpass the
Correlational Statistical Query (CSQ) lower bound and achieve near
information-theoretically optimal rate in previous works. Our analysis reveals
the crucial role of the nonlinear gating mechanism in Mamba for feature
extraction, highlighting it as the fundamental driver behind Mamba's ability to
achieve both computational efficiency and high performance.

Abstract: Generative classifiers, which leverage conditional generative models for
classification, have recently demonstrated desirable properties such as
robustness to distribution shifts. However, recent progress in this area has
been largely driven by diffusion-based models, whose substantial computational
cost severely limits scalability. This exclusive focus on diffusion-based
methods has also constrained our understanding of generative classifiers. In
this work, we propose a novel generative classifier built on recent advances in
visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, which offers a new perspective for
studying generative classifiers. To further enhance its performance, we
introduce the Adaptive VAR Classifier$^+$ (A-VARC$^+$), which achieves a
superior trade-off between accuracy and inference speed, thereby significantly
improving practical applicability. Moreover, we show that the VAR-based method
exhibits fundamentally different properties from diffusion-based methods. In
particular, due to its tractable likelihood, the VAR-based classifier enables
visual explainability via token-wise mutual information and demonstrates
inherent resistance to catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning
tasks.

Abstract: Deep learning-based automatic sleep staging has significantly advanced in
performance and plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of sleep disorders.
However, those models often struggle to generalize on unseen subjects due to
variability in physiological signals, resulting in degraded performance in
out-of-distribution scenarios. To address this issue, domain generalization
approaches have recently been studied to ensure generalized performance on
unseen domains during training. Among those techniques, contrastive learning
has proven its validity in learning domain-invariant features by aligning
samples of the same class across different domains. Despite its potential, many
existing methods are insufficient to extract adequately domain-invariant
representations, as they do not explicitly address domain characteristics
embedded within the unshared information across samples. In this paper, we
posit that mitigating such domain-relevant attributes-referred to as excess
domain-relevant information-is key to bridging the domain gap. However, the
direct strategy to mitigate the domain-relevant attributes often overfits
features at the high-level information, limiting their ability to leverage the
diverse temporal and spectral information encoded in the multiple feature
levels. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MEASURE (Multi-scalE
minimAl SUfficient Representation lEarning) framework, which effectively
reduces domain-relevant information while preserving essential temporal and
spectral features for sleep stage classification. In our exhaustive experiments
on publicly available sleep staging benchmark datasets, SleepEDF-20 and MASS,
our proposed method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods. Our

Motivation: 当前的数据归因方法将样本间影响力视为静态的，但神经网络学习过程包含不同阶段，这些阶段展现出变化的影响力模式。

Method: 基于奇异学习理论构建阶段性数据归因框架，通过玩具模型和语言模型验证影响力动态变化的理论预测。

Result: 验证了影响力可以非单调变化，包括符号翻转和在发展过渡期的急剧峰值，这些变化与模型学习语义层次结构的进程直接对应。

Conclusion: 神经网络训练过程中样本间影响力确实存在动态变化，这些变化与模型的发展阶段相一致，为理解深度学习动态提供了新视角。

Abstract: Current training data attribution (TDA) methods treat the influence one
sample has on another as static, but neural networks learn in distinct stages
that exhibit changing patterns of influence. In this work, we introduce a
framework for stagewise data attribution grounded in singular learning theory.
We predict that influence can change non-monotonically, including sign flips
and sharp peaks at developmental transitions. We first validate these
predictions analytically and empirically in a toy model, showing that dynamic
shifts in influence directly map to the model's progressive learning of a
semantic hierarchy. Finally, we demonstrate these phenomena at scale in
language models, where token-level influence changes align with known
developmental stages.

TL;DR: GraphShaper是一个几何感知的图基础模型框架，通过多几何专业化解决现有方法在结构边界处性能下降的问题，在零样本设置下显著提升准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的图表示学习方法假设所有图结构都可以在单一欧几里得空间中编码，但实际上树结构需要双曲几何来保持层次分支，循环模式依赖球形几何的闭包特性。在结构边界处，节点面临冲突的几何约束，导致性能下降超过20个百分点。

Method: GraphShaper采用多几何专业化方法，使用针对不同几何空间的专家网络，动态计算融合权重，根据局部结构特征自适应地整合几何属性，在文本嵌入对齐前保持结构完整性。

Result: 在零样本设置下，GraphShaper在引文网络上实现9.47%的准确率提升，在社交网络上实现7.63%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: GraphShaper通过几何感知的框架成功解决了图结构边界处的性能退化问题，证明了尊重图结构内在几何多样性的对齐框架设计的重要性。

Abstract: Graph foundation models represent a transformative paradigm for learning
transferable representations across diverse graph domains. Recent methods
leverage large language models to unify graph and text modalities into a shared
representation space using contrastive learning. However, systematic
evaluations reveal significant performance degradation at structural boundaries
where distinct topological patterns converge, with accuracy losses exceeding 20
percentage points. This issue arises from a key limitation: current methods
assume all graph structures can be encoded within a single Euclidean space. In
reality, tree structures require hyperbolic geometry to preserve hierarchical
branching, while cyclic patterns depend on spherical geometry for closure
properties. At structural boundaries, nodes experience conflicting geometric
constraints that uniform encoding spaces cannot resolve. This raises a crucial
challenge: \textbf{Can alignment frameworks be designed to respect the
intrinsic geometric diversity of graph structures?} We introduce
\textbf{GraphShaper}, a geometry-aware framework that enhances graph encoding
through multi-geometric specialization. Our approach employs expert networks
tailored to different geometric spaces, dynamically computing fusion weights to
adaptively integrate geometric properties based on local structural
characteristics. This adaptive fusion preserves structural integrity before
alignment with text embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
GraphShaper achieves 9.47\% accuracy improvements on citation networks and
7.63\% on social networks in zero-shot settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出H4G框架，通过可学习的块对角缩放矩阵和Möbius矩阵乘法系统性地减小双曲空间中的嵌入半径，解决了现有方法在异配性图上过度抽象的问题，显著提升了零样本图学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本属性图方法在需要细粒度模式识别的任务上表现不佳，特别是在异配性图上。通过实证和理论分析发现存在过度抽象问题：当前方法在过大的双曲半径下操作，将多尺度结构信息压缩成统一的高层抽象，导致关键局部模式丢失。

Method: 提出H4G框架，使用可学习的块对角缩放矩阵和Möbius矩阵乘法来系统性地减小嵌入半径，从而恢复对细粒度模式的访问，同时以最小计算开销保持全局感知能力。

Result: H4G在零样本性能上达到最先进水平，在异配性图上提升12.8%，在同配性图上提升8.4%，证实半径减小能够实现忠实的多尺度表示。

Conclusion: 通过减小双曲空间中的嵌入半径，H4G框架能够更好地保留细粒度结构细节，为推进零样本图学习提供了有效的多尺度表示方法。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs are widely used across domains, offering rich
opportunities for zero-shot learning via graph-text alignment. However,
existing methods struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained pattern
recognition, particularly on heterophilic graphs. Through empirical and
theoretical analysis, we identify an \textbf{over-abstraction problem}: current
approaches operate at excessively large hyperbolic radii, compressing
multi-scale structural information into uniform high-level abstractions. This
abstraction-induced information loss obscures critical local patterns essential
for accurate predictions. By analyzing embeddings in hyperbolic space, we
demonstrate that optimal graph learning requires \textbf{faithful preservation}
of fine-grained structural details, better retained by representations
positioned closer to the origin. To address this, we propose \textbf{H4G}, a
framework that systematically reduces embedding radii using learnable
block-diagonal scaling matrices and M\"obius matrix multiplication. This
approach restores access to fine-grained patterns while maintaining global
receptive ability with minimal computational overhead. Experiments show H4G
achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance with \textbf{12.8\%}
improvement on heterophilic graphs and \textbf{8.4\%} on homophilic graphs,
confirming that radius reduction enables faithful multi-scale representation
for advancing zero-shot graph learning.

Motivation: 深度强化学习中神经网络扩展往往导致性能下降，主要由于可塑性损失等优化问题。现有动态训练方法存在三个关键局限：对所有模块采用统一策略、缺乏架构改进对比、缺少不同动态方法系统比较。

Method: 通过全面研究不同模块和架构，开发模块特定训练(MST)框架，在不同模块采用定制化的动态稀疏训练策略，包括稀疏到稀疏、稠密到稀疏、稀疏到稠密等方法。

Result: 研究表明动态稀疏训练策略提供模块特定优势，与架构改进形成互补。MST框架在不修改算法的情况下，显著提升了各种RL算法的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 模块特定训练框架有效解决了深度强化学习的扩展问题，动态稀疏训练与架构改进相结合是实现可扩展深度强化学习的关键。

Abstract: Scaling neural networks has driven breakthrough advances in machine learning,
yet this paradigm fails in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), where larger
models often degrade performance due to unique optimization pathologies such as
plasticity loss. While recent works show that dynamically adapting network
topology during training can mitigate these issues, existing studies have three
critical limitations: (1) applying uniform dynamic training strategies across
all modules despite encoder, critic, and actor following distinct learning
paradigms, (2) focusing evaluation on basic architectures without clarifying
the relative importance and interaction between dynamic training and
architectural improvements, and (3) lacking systematic comparison between
different dynamic approaches including sparse-to-sparse, dense-to-sparse, and
sparse-to-dense. Through comprehensive investigation across modules and
architectures, we reveal that dynamic sparse training strategies provide
module-specific benefits that complement the primary scalability foundation
established by architectural improvements. We finally distill these insights
into Module-Specific Training (MST), a practical framework that further
exploits the benefits of architectural improvements and demonstrates
substantial scalability gains across diverse RL algorithms without algorithmic
modifications.

TL;DR: Chimera是一个统一模型，通过状态空间模型直接融入数据拓扑结构，无需领域特定的偏置，在语言、视觉和图领域都取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Transformer方法依赖自注意力机制，将数据视为无序元素集合，忽略了数据的邻域结构或图拓扑，需要设计任务特定的偏置（如位置嵌入、随机游走）来融入拓扑，但这些偏置设计复杂且可能阻碍泛化。

Method: 提出Chimera模型，将状态空间模型推广到能够捕获任意图拓扑结构，无需位置嵌入。针对有向无环图可实现线性时间递归实现，对一般图通过数学松弛达到Transformer的二次复杂度。

Result: Chimera在GLUE上比BERT高0.7分，在ImageNet-1k上比ViT高2.6%，在Long Range Graph Benchmark上优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: 数据拓扑是跨模态的强大归纳偏置，Chimera验证了这一核心贡献，为统一建模不同数据模态提供了新思路。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning methods have become the standard approach for
modeling diverse data such as sequences, images, and graphs. These methods rely
on self-attention, which treats data as an unordered set of elements. This
ignores the neighborhood structure or graph topology of the data and requires
inductive biases--such as position embeddings in sequences and images, or
random walks in graphs--to incorporate topology. However, designing such
task-specific biases requires significant effort and can introduce side effects
that hinder generalization. We introduce Chimera, a unified model that directly
incorporates data topology in a principled way, removing the need for
domain-specific biases. The key idea is that state space models--which
naturally do not require position embeddings--can be generalized to capture any
graph topology. Our experiments show that Chimera achieves strong performance
across language, vision, and graph domains, outperforming BERT on GLUE by 0.7
points, ViT on ImageNet-1k by 2.6%, and all baselines on the Long Range Graph
Benchmark. We further propose algorithmic optimizations to improve Chimera's
efficiency: (1) for Directed Acyclic Graphs, Chimera can be implemented as a
linear-time recurrence; (2) for general graphs, a simple mathematical
relaxation achieves Transformer's quadratic complexity without domain-specific
heuristics. These results validate Chimera's core contribution and support the
idea that data topology is a powerful inductive bias across modalities.

TL;DR: 提出了GRACE框架，通过自适应频谱专家和跨集分布校准技术解决图少样本学习中的局部结构异质性和分布差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图少样本学习方法存在两个关键局限：一是使用预定义的统一图滤波器无法处理真实图中局部拓扑结构的异质性；二是假设支持集和查询集来自相同分布，但在少样本条件下有限的支持集数据可能无法充分捕捉查询集的复杂分布。

Method: GRACE框架整合了自适应频谱专家和跨集分布校准技术，前者适应局部结构变化，后者校准跨集分布差异。

Result: 理论分析表明该方法通过适应局部结构变化和跨集分布校准增强了模型泛化能力；实证结果显示GRACE在各种实验设置下持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: GRACE框架有效解决了图少样本学习中的局部结构异质性和分布差异问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Graph few-shot learning has attracted increasing attention due to its ability
to rapidly adapt models to new tasks with only limited labeled nodes. Despite
the remarkable progress made by existing graph few-shot learning methods,
several key limitations remain. First, most current approaches rely on
predefined and unified graph filters (e.g., low-pass or high-pass filters) to
globally enhance or suppress node frequency signals. Such fixed spectral
operations fail to account for the heterogeneity of local topological
structures inherent in real-world graphs. Moreover, these methods often assume
that the support and query sets are drawn from the same distribution. However,
under few-shot conditions, the limited labeled data in the support set may not
sufficiently capture the complex distribution of the query set, leading to
suboptimal generalization. To address these challenges, we propose GRACE, a
novel Graph few-shot leaRning framework that integrates Adaptive spectrum
experts with Cross-sEt distribution calibration techniques. Theoretically, the
proposed approach enhances model generalization by adapting to both local
structural variations and cross-set distribution calibration. Empirically,
GRACE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range
of experimental settings. Our code can be found here.

Motivation: 联邦学习虽然保护数据隐私，但由于参与者对训练数据的独立性，容易受到投毒攻击。协作过程会传播偏见，即使是无意的，也会因数据分布不同或历史偏见而加剧。

Method: 提出一种有意的公平性攻击，恶意客户端在训练时增加公平性损失，通过解决公平性指标（如人口统计均等和均等化几率）的优化问题来计算公平性损失。

Result: 攻击效果显著，即使只有一个恶意客户端，也能将偏见增加高达90%，且攻击难以检测，因为全局准确性保持不变。

Conclusion: 该攻击对最先进的拜占庭鲁棒和公平感知聚合方案构成威胁，突显了联邦学习系统在公平性方面的脆弱性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique
that facilitates collaboration among participants across demographics. FL
enables model sharing, while restricting the movement of data. Since FL
provides participants with independence over their training data, it becomes
susceptible to poisoning attacks. Such collaboration also propagates bias among
the participants, even unintentionally, due to different data distribution or
historical bias present in the data. This paper proposes an intentional
fairness attack, where a client maliciously sends a biased model, by increasing
the fairness loss while training, even considering homogeneous data
distribution. The fairness loss is calculated by solving an optimization
problem for fairness metrics such as demographic parity and equalized odds. The
attack is insidious and hard to detect, as it maintains global accuracy even
after increasing the bias. We evaluate our attack against the state-of-the-art
Byzantine-robust and fairness-aware aggregation schemes over different
datasets, in various settings. The empirical results demonstrate the attack
efficacy by increasing the bias up to 90\%, even in the presence of a single
malicious client in the FL system.

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功地将预算学习应用于生存数据，提供了理论保证和实证验证，为处理删失数据的预算学习问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Standard supervised learners attempt to learn a model from a labeled dataset.
Given a small set of labeled instances, and a pool of unlabeled instances, a
budgeted learner can use its given budget to pay to acquire the labels of some
unlabeled instances, which it can then use to produce a model. Here, we explore
budgeted learning in the context of survival datasets, which include (right)
censored instances, where we know only a lower bound on an instance's
time-to-event. Here, that learner can pay to (partially) label a censored
instance -- e.g., to acquire the actual time for an instance [perhaps go from
(3 yr, censored) to (7.2 yr, uncensored)], or other variants [e.g., learn about
one more year, so go from (3 yr, censored) to either (4 yr, censored) or
perhaps (3.2 yr, uncensored)]. This serves as a model of real world data
collection, where follow-up with censored patients does not always lead to
uncensoring, and how much information is given to the learner model during data
collection is a function of the budget and the nature of the data itself. We
provide both experimental and theoretical results for how to apply
state-of-the-art budgeted learning algorithms to survival data and the
respective limitations that exist in doing so. Our approach provides bounds and
time complexity asymptotically equivalent to the standard active learning
method BatchBALD. Moreover, empirical analysis on several survival tasks show
that our model performs better than other potential approaches on several
benchmarks.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在推理过程中会进行反思和自我验证，但研究发现LLM在思维链中检测错误的能力有限，反思如何带来实际改进尚不清楚。

Method: 构建最小化推理框架，支持小型Transformer进行基本的自我验证反思，避免使用自然语言以确保分析清晰度并降低实验成本。

Result: 理论上证明当验证误差有界时，自我验证反思能保证改进；实验显示仅几百万参数的小型Transformer在训练和反思执行中受益，在整数乘法和数独任务中达到LLM级别性能。

Conclusion: 将生成式Transformer与判别式验证相结合，本质上促进了思维链推理，这种效果不依赖于模型规模和自然语言的使用。

Abstract: Advanced large language models (LLMs) frequently reflect in reasoning
chain-of-thoughts (CoTs), where they self-verify the correctness of current
solutions and explore alternatives. However, given recent findings that LLMs
detect limited errors in CoTs, how reflection contributes to empirical
improvements remains unclear. To analyze this issue, in this paper, we present
a minimalistic reasoning framework to support basic self-verifying reflection
for small transformers without natural language, which ensures analytic clarity
and reduces the cost of comprehensive experiments. Theoretically, we prove that
self-verifying reflection guarantees improvements if verification errors are
properly bounded. Experimentally, we show that tiny transformers, with only a
few million parameters, benefit from self-verification in both training and
reflective execution, reaching remarkable LLM-level performance in integer
multiplication and Sudoku. Similar to LLM results, we find that reinforcement
learning (RL) improves in-distribution performance and incentivizes frequent
reflection for tiny transformers, yet RL mainly optimizes shallow statistical
patterns without faithfully reducing verification errors. In conclusion,
integrating generative transformers with discriminative verification inherently
facilitates CoT reasoning, regardless of scaling and natural language.

Motivation: 现有元学习样本重加权方法虽然能利用少量干净样本来指导训练，但其行为机制和训练动态缺乏理论理解，需要深入分析以改进方法。

Method: 首先对元重加权方法进行严格理论分析，揭示其训练轨迹的三个阶段；然后基于分析结果提出一个集成均值中心化、行偏移和标签符号调制的轻量级替代方法。

Result: 在合成和真实标签噪声基准测试中，所提方法在性能稳定性方面优于现有的重加权/选择基线方法。

Conclusion: 元重加权的训练机制依赖于训练信号与干净子集信号之间的相似性加权耦合，当干净子集损失足够小时会失去判别能力；提出的轻量级方法避免了昂贵的双层优化，获得了更稳定的性能。

Abstract: Learning with noisy labels remains challenging because over-parameterized
networks memorize corrupted supervision. Meta-learning-based sample reweighting
mitigates this by using a small clean subset to guide training, yet its
behavior and training dynamics lack theoretical understanding. We provide a
rigorous theoretical analysis of meta-reweighting under label noise and show
that its training trajectory unfolds in three phases: (i) an alignment phase
that amplifies examples consistent with a clean subset and suppresses
conflicting ones; (ii) a filtering phase driving noisy example weights toward
zero until the clean subset loss plateaus; and (iii) a post-filtering phase in
which noise filtration becomes perturbation-sensitive. The mechanism is a
similarity-weighted coupling between training and clean subset signals together
with clean subset training loss contraction; in the post-filtering regime where
the clean-subset loss is sufficiently small, the coupling term vanishes and
meta-reweighting loses discriminatory power. Guided by this analysis, we
propose a lightweight surrogate for meta-reweighting that integrates
mean-centering, row shifting, and label-signed modulation, yielding more stable
performance while avoiding expensive bi-level optimization. Across synthetic
and real noisy-label benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms strong
reweighting/selection baselines.

Motivation: 医疗应用中的早期时间序列分类（如ICU中的脓毒症预测）至关重要，但面临准确性和早期性之间的权衡挑战，现有方法难以捕捉早期微弱信号并处理类别不平衡问题。

Method: 1）结合传统时间增强和注意力全局时间增强的双增强策略；2）基于注意力分数的软形状稀疏化机制；3）双路径专家混合网络（MoE）和Inception模块融合架构，MoE进行形状内局部学习，Inception模块捕捉形状间全局模式。

Conclusion: DE3S框架通过精确识别形状，有效解决了医疗早期时间序列分类中的准确性与早期性冲突问题，具有鲁棒性和高解释性。

Abstract: Early time-series classification (ETSC) in medical applications is crucial
for time-sensitive scenarios such as sepsis prediction in intensive care units
(ICUs), where a large number of deaths are caused by delayed prediction. ETSC
can significantly improve ICU resource utilization efficiency and healthcare
precision. However, it faces conflicting goals of accuracy and earliness, with
existing methods often trading one for the other, struggling to capture subtle
early-stage patterns due to weak initial signals and class imbalance. The key
to solve these challenges is to find shapelets, which are discriminative
subsequences (or shapes) with high interpretability in time-series
classification. This paper proposes Dual-Enhanced Soft-Sparse-Shape Learning
for Medical Early Time-Series Classification (DE3S), which introduces a novel
Dual-Enhanced Soft-Shape Learning framework to figure out shapelets precisely
through three innovations: (1) a comprehensive dual-enhancement strategy
combines traditional temporal augmentation with attention-based global temporal
enhancement for robust representation learning, (2) an attention-score-based
soft shapelet sparsification mechanism dynamically preserves discriminative
patterns while aggregating less important shapelets into representative tokens,
and (3) a dual-path Mixture of Experts Network (MoE) and Inception modules
fusion architecture where MoE performs local learning within shapelets and
multi-scale Inception modules capture global patterns across shapelets. The
framework employs weighted cross-entropy loss for class imbalance handling and
demonstrates robustness on subject-consistency datasets. Extensive experiments
on six real-world medical datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with

### [191] [Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion: Fast Generation with Interpretable Diffusion Trajectory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12220)
*Hanru Bai,Weiyang Ding,Difan Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion框架，通过Koopman算子理论将非线性扩散动态提升到线性潜在空间，实现单步采样和可解释生成轨迹，解决了扩散模型采样慢与可解释性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然能生成高质量图像，但迭代去噪过程导致采样速度慢。现有单步方法虽然加速推理，但牺牲了扩散动态的可解释性和精细控制能力，这些特性对于可编辑生成等应用至关重要。

Method: 基于Koopman算子理论，将非线性扩散动态提升到潜在空间，其中演化由全局线性算子控制，实现闭式轨迹解。设计分层架构，通过尺度特定的Koopman子空间在不同空间分辨率上解耦生成动态，系统捕获从粗到细的细节。

Result: Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion不仅实现了竞争性的单步生成性能，还通过谱分析提供了理解和操纵生成过程的原理机制。

Conclusion: 该框架弥合了扩散模型中快速采样与可解释性之间的差距，为生成建模中的可解释图像合成铺平了道路。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive success in high-fidelity image
generation but suffer from slow sampling due to their inherently iterative
denoising process. While recent one-step methods accelerate inference by
learning direct noise-to-image mappings, they sacrifice the interpretability
and fine-grained control intrinsic to diffusion dynamics, key advantages that
enable applications like editable generation. To resolve this dichotomy, we
introduce \textbf{Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion}, a novel framework that
achieves both one-step sampling and interpretable generative trajectories.
Grounded in Koopman operator theory, our method lifts the nonlinear diffusion
dynamics into a latent space where evolution is governed by globally linear
operators, enabling closed-form trajectory solutions. This formulation not only
eliminates iterative sampling but also provides full access to intermediate
states, allowing manual intervention during generation. To model the
multi-scale nature of images, we design a hierarchical architecture that
disentangles generative dynamics across spatial resolutions via scale-specific
Koopman subspaces, capturing coarse-to-fine details systematically. We
empirically show that the Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion not only achieves
competitive one-step generation performance but also provides a principled
mechanism for interpreting and manipulating the generative process through
spectral analysis. Our framework bridges the gap between fast sampling and
interpretability in diffusion models, paving the way for explainable image
synthesis in generative modeling.

TL;DR: 提出了IMDGA框架，一种可解释的多维图攻击方法，统一了图结构和文本特征的双重攻击，揭示了Graph-LLM的语义维度漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph-LLM虽然通过结合图神经网络和大语言模型增强了表达能力，但容易受到结构和文本双重攻击，现有方法缺乏统一的多维攻击框架。

Method: IMDGA框架包含三个紧密集成的模块，协调执行图结构和文本特征的多层次扰动，平衡可解释性和攻击效果。

Result: 在多个数据集和架构上的实验表明，IMDGA在可解释性、攻击效果、隐蔽性和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该工作揭示了Graph-LLM中未被充分探索的语义维度漏洞，为提高其韧性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a pivotal framework for modeling
graph-structured data, enabling a wide range of applications from social
network analysis to molecular chemistry. By integrating large language models
(LLMs), text-attributed graphs (TAGs) enhance node representations with rich
textual semantics, significantly boosting the expressive power of graph-based
learning. However, this sophisticated synergy introduces critical
vulnerabilities, as Graph-LLMs are susceptible to adversarial attacks on both
their structural topology and textual attributes. Although specialized attack
methods have been designed for each of these aspects, no work has yet unified
them into a comprehensive approach. In this work, we propose the Interpretable
Multi-Dimensional Graph Attack (IMDGA), a novel human-centric adversarial
attack framework designed to orchestrate multi-level perturbations across both
graph structure and textual features. IMDGA utilizes three tightly integrated
modules to craft attacks that balance interpretability and impact, enabling a
deeper understanding of Graph-LLM vulnerabilities. Through rigorous theoretical
analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations on diverse datasets and
architectures, IMDGA demonstrates superior interpretability, attack
effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness compared to existing methods. By
exposing critical weaknesses in TAG representation learning, this work uncovers
a previously underexplored semantic dimension of vulnerability in Graph-LLMs,
offering valuable insights for improving their resilience. Our code and

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种分子感知的低秩自适应方法(MoRA)，为每个输入分子图动态生成独特的低秩适配权重，解决了现有方法在共享参数空间和灾难性遗忘方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理分子图结构时存在两个主要问题：共享参数空间限制了模型捕捉实例特定结构特征的能力，以及微调LLM会导致灾难性遗忘，削弱其通用推理能力。

Method: MoRA方法为每个输入分子图动态生成独特的低秩适配权重，然后将这些权重注入到冻结的LLM中，实现实例特定的参数空间对齐。

Result: 在关键分子任务上表现优异，化学反应预测的精确匹配相对提升14.1%，量子性质预测误差降低22%。

Conclusion: MoRA的实例特定动态适配方法优于静态适配基线，能够在保持LLM核心知识的同时，根据每个分子输入的结构调整推理过程。

Abstract: Effectively integrating molecular graph structures with Large Language Models
(LLMs) is a key challenge in drug discovery. Most existing multi-modal
alignment methods typically process these structures by fine-tuning the LLM or
adding a static adapter simultaneously. However, these approaches have two main
limitations: (1) it optimizes a shared parameter space across all molecular
inputs, limiting the model's ability to capture instance-specific structural
features; and (2) fine-tuning the LLM for molecular tasks can lead to
catastrophic forgetting, undermining its general reasoning capabilities. In
this paper, instead of static task-oriented adaptation, we propose an
instance-specific parameter space alignment approach for each molecule
on-the-fly. To this end, we introduce Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (MoRA)
that produces a unique set of low-rank adaptation weights for each input
molecular graph. These weights are then dynamically injected into a frozen LLM,
allowing the model to adapt its reasoning to the structure of each molecular
input, while preserving the LLM's core knowledge. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that on key molecular tasks, such as chemical reaction prediction
and molecular captioning, MoRA's instance-specific dynamic adaptation
outperforms statically adapted baselines, including a 14.1% relative
improvement in reaction prediction exact match and a 22% reduction in error for
quantum property prediction. The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了在表演性学习中使用正则化处理数据分布随模型部署而变化的问题，发现在过参数化情况下表演性效应可能有益，并提出了基于表演性效应强度设置正则化的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在表演性学习中，数据分布会因部署的模型而改变（例如用户策略性调整特征），这比传统监督学习更复杂。需要同时优化当前数据和考虑模型可能引导分布变化的影响。

Method: 研究高维岭回归中正则化的影响，分析表演性效应在不同参数化情况下的作用，并通过合成和真实数据集进行实证评估。

Result: 表演性效应在总体设置中会恶化测试风险，但在过参数化情况下可能有益。最优正则化与表演性效应的整体强度成比例，可以据此设置正则化参数。

Conclusion: 正则化可以有效应对表演性效应，特别是在过参数化情况下，通过根据表演性效应强度调整正则化参数可以获得更好的性能。

Abstract: In performative learning, the data distribution reacts to the deployed model
- for example, because strategic users adapt their features to game it - which
creates a more complex dynamic than in classical supervised learning. One
should thus not only optimize the model for the current data but also take into
account that the model might steer the distribution in a new direction, without
knowing the exact nature of the potential shift. We explore how regularization
can help cope with performative effects by studying its impact in
high-dimensional ridge regression. We show that, while performative effects
worsen the test risk in the population setting, they can be beneficial in the
over-parameterized regime where the number of features exceeds the number of
samples. We show that the optimal regularization scales with the overall
strength of the performative effect, making it possible to set the
regularization in anticipation of this effect. We illustrate this finding
through empirical evaluations of the optimal regularization parameter on both
synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs), as a leading class of generative models, offer key
advantages for reinforcement learning (RL), including multi-modal
expressiveness, stable training, and trajectory-level planning. This survey
delivers a comprehensive and up-to-date synthesis of diffusion-based RL. We
first provide an overview of RL, highlighting its challenges, and then
introduce the fundamental concepts of DMs, investigating how they are
integrated into RL frameworks to address key challenges in this research field.
We establish a dual-axis taxonomy that organizes the field along two orthogonal
dimensions: a function-oriented taxonomy that clarifies the roles DMs play
within the RL pipeline, and a technique-oriented taxonomy that situates
implementations across online versus offline learning regimes. We also provide
a comprehensive examination of this progression from single-agent to
multi-agent domains, thereby forming several frameworks for DM-RL integration
and highlighting their practical utility. Furthermore, we outline several
categories of successful applications of diffusion-based RL across diverse
domains, discuss open research issues of current methodologies, and highlight
key directions for future research to advance the field. Finally, we summarize
the survey to identify promising future development directions. We are actively
maintaining a GitHub repository (https://github.com/ChangfuXu/D4RL-FTD) for
papers and other related resources to apply DMs for RL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HiLoRA是一个无需训练的分层路由框架，通过自适应选择LoRA模块和细粒度参数激活来解决现有方法在领域泛化中的参数冗余或不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoRA复用方法依赖显式任务标签或额外训练，且通常激活固定数量的整个LoRA模块，导致参数冗余或不足，影响性能。

Method: 定义秩一组件(ROCs)，在序列级自适应选择LoRA子集并确定ROC分配，在token级进一步细化路由，仅激活最相关的ROCs。

Result: 在领域泛化任务中实现显著提升，准确率比最先进基线提高高达55%，同时保持相当的推理吞吐量。

Conclusion: HiLoRA提供了一种无需训练的高效LoRA复用方法，通过分层路由机制实现了更好的领域泛化性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a widely used technique for
adapting large language models (LLMs) to new domains, due to its modular design
and broad availability on platforms such as HuggingFace. This availability has
motivated efforts to reuse existing LoRAs for domain generalization.
  However, existing methods often rely on explicit task labels or additional
training, which are impractical for deployment. Moreover, they typically
activate a fixed number of entire LoRA modules, leading to parameter redundancy
or insufficiency that degrade performance.
  In this paper, we propose \texttt{HiLoRA}, a training-free framework that
performs adaptive hierarchical routing over LoRA pools. Drawing on structural
properties of LoRA, we define rank-one components (ROCs), in which each rank
parameter is regarded as an independent unit. For a given input sequence,
\texttt{HiLoRA} first adaptively selects a subset of LoRAs and determines their
ROC allocation based on Gaussian likelihoods at the sequence level. At the
token level, it further refines routing by activating only the most informative
ROCs.
  We further provide theoretical guarantees that \texttt{HiLoRA} selects the
most relevant LoRAs with high probability.
  Extensive experiments show that \texttt{HiLoRA} achieves substantial
improvements in domain generalization, with accuracy gains of up to {\small
$55\%$} over state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining comparable inference
throughput.

Conclusion: 通过多智能体联合行动和集合预测损失，提出的方法显著提高了自改进的效率和效果，特别是在需要多智能体协调的组合优化问题中表现优异。

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a state-of-the-art paradigm in Neural
Combinatorial Optimization (NCO), where models iteratively refine their
policies by generating and imitating high-quality solutions. Despite strong
empirical performance, existing methods face key limitations. Training is
computationally expensive, as policy updates require sampling numerous
candidate solutions per instance to extract a single expert trajectory. More
fundamentally, these approaches fail to exploit the structure of combinatorial
problems involving the coordination of multiple agents, such as vehicles in
min-max routing or machines in scheduling. By supervising on single-action
trajectories, they fail to exploit agent-permutation symmetries, where distinct
sequences of actions yield identical solutions, hindering generalization and
the ability to learn coordinated behavior.
  We address these challenges by extending self-improvement to operate over
joint multi-agent actions. Our model architecture predicts complete agent-task
assignments jointly at each decision step. To explicitly leverage symmetries,
we employ a set-prediction loss, which supervises the policy on multiple expert
assignments for any given state. This approach enhances sample efficiency and
the model's ability to learn coordinated behavior. Furthermore, by generating
multi-agent actions in parallel, it drastically accelerates the solution
generation phase of the self-improvement loop. Empirically, we validate our
method on several combinatorial problems, demonstrating consistent improvements
in the quality of the final solution and a reduced generation latency compared
to standard self-improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理信息极限学习机在处理高频和变频偏微分方程时面临挑战，需要一种能够有效捕捉目标解不同频率分量的改进方法。

Method: 将傅里叶特征映射变体集成到ELM中作为基于傅里叶的激活函数，为隐藏神经元分配频率系数，并开发了一种基于ELM输出权重分布的初始化方法。

Result: 在五个案例研究中的十个数值示例中，GFF-PIELM显著提高了预测精度，同时保持了训练时间和架构复杂度的优势。

Conclusion: GFF-PIELM成功扩展了PIELM解决高频和变频PDE的能力，其初始化策略可能启发其他物理信息机器学习框架的发展。

Abstract: Conventional physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) often faces
challenges in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) involving
high-frequency and variable-frequency behaviors. To address these challenges,
we propose a general Fourier feature physics-informed extreme learning machine
(GFF-PIELM). We demonstrate that directly concatenating multiple Fourier
feature mappings (FFMs) and an extreme learning machine (ELM) network makes it
difficult to determine frequency-related hyperparameters. Fortunately, we find
an alternative to establish the GFF-PIELM in three main steps. First, we
integrate a variation of FFM into ELM as the Fourier-based activation function,
so there is still one hidden layer in the GFF-PIELM framework. Second, we
assign a set of frequency coefficients to the hidden neurons, which enables ELM
network to capture diverse frequency components of target solutions. Finally,
we develop an innovative, straightforward initialization method for these
hyperparameters by monitoring the distribution of ELM output weights. GFF-PIELM
not only retains the high accuracy, efficiency, and simplicity of the PIELM
framework but also inherits the ability of FFMs to effectively handle
high-frequency problems. We carry out five case studies with a total of ten
numerical examples to highlight the feasibility and validity of the proposed
GFF-PIELM, involving high frequency, variable frequency, multi-scale behaviour,
irregular boundary and inverse problems. Compared to conventional PIELM, the
GFF-PIELM approach significantly improves predictive accuracy without
additional cost in training time and architecture complexity. Our results
confirm that that PIELM can be extended to solve high-frequency and
variable-frequency PDEs with high accuracy, and our initialization strategy may
further inspire advances in other physics-informed machine learning (PIML)
frameworks.

Conclusion: 该研究成功将经典安全策略改进理论扩展到在线深度强化学习，为结合世界模型和表示学习的策略改进提供了理论框架和有效算法。

Abstract: Safe policy improvement (SPI) offers theoretical control over policy updates,
yet existing guarantees largely concern offline, tabular reinforcement learning
(RL). We study SPI in general online settings, when combined with world model
and representation learning. We develop a theoretical framework showing that
restricting policy updates to a well-defined neighborhood of the current policy
ensures monotonic improvement and convergence. This analysis links transition
and reward prediction losses to representation quality, yielding online, "deep"
analogues of classical SPI theorems from the offline RL literature. Building on
these results, we introduce DeepSPI, a principled on-policy algorithm that
couples local transition and reward losses with regularised policy updates. On
the ALE-57 benchmark, DeepSPI matches or exceeds strong baselines, including
PPO and DeepMDPs, while retaining theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Accurate rainfall forecasting, particularly for extreme events, remains a
significant challenge in climatology and the Earth system. This paper presents
novel physics-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combined with extreme-value
analysis techniques to improve gauge-station rainfall predictions across
Thailand. The model leverages a graph-structured representation of gauge
stations to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns, and it offers
explainability through teleconnections. We preprocess relevant climate indices
that potentially influence regional rainfall. The proposed Graph Attention
Network with Long Short-Term Memory (Attention-LSTM) applies the attention
mechanism using initial edge features derived from simple
orographic-precipitation physics formulation. The embeddings are subsequently
processed by LSTM layers. To address extremes, we perform Peak-Over-Threshold
(POT) mapping using the novel Spatial Season-aware Generalized Pareto
Distribution (GPD) method, which overcomes limitations of traditional
machine-learning models. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
well-established baselines across most regions, including areas prone to
extremes, and remains strongly competitive with the state of the art. Compared
with the operational forecasting system SEAS5, our real-world application
improves extreme-event prediction and offers a practical enhancement to produce
fine-resolution maps that support decision-making in long-term water
management.

TL;DR: 首次对马尔可夫采样下具有演化奖励函数的单时间尺度actor-critic算法进行了有限时间收敛性分析，证明了在奖励参数缓慢变化时仍能达到O(1/√T)的收敛速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多实用的强化学习算法使用演化奖励函数（如奖励塑形、熵正则化、课程学习），但其理论基础尚不完善，需要理论分析来支持这些技术。

Method: 采用单时间尺度actor-critic算法，在马尔可夫采样下分析奖励参数随时间步变化的情况，使用梯度更新规则且梯度有界。

Result: 在标准假设下，推导了actor和critic误差的非渐近界，证明当奖励参数演化足够慢时，可以达到O(1/√T)的收敛速率，与静态奖励的最佳已知速率匹配。

Conclusion: 为许多流行的RL技术提供了理论基础，同时在静态奖励情况下改进了分布不匹配分析，将最佳已知速率提高了log²T倍。

Abstract: Many popular practical reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms employ evolving
reward functions-through techniques such as reward shaping, entropy
regularization, or curriculum learning-yet their theoretical foundations remain
underdeveloped. This paper provides the first finite-time convergence analysis
of a single-timescale actor-critic algorithm in the presence of an evolving
reward function under Markovian sampling. We consider a setting where the
reward parameters may change at each time step, affecting both policy
optimization and value estimation. Under standard assumptions, we derive
non-asymptotic bounds for both actor and critic errors. Our result shows that
an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate is achievable, matching the best-known rate
for static rewards, provided the reward parameters evolve slowly enough. This
rate is preserved when the reward is updated via a gradient-based rule with
bounded gradient and on the same timescale as the actor and critic, offering a
theoretical foundation for many popular RL techniques. As a secondary
contribution, we introduce a novel analysis of distribution mismatch under
Markovian sampling, improving the best-known rate by a factor of $\log^2T$ in
the static-reward case.

Motivation: 随着用户使用私密信息与LLM交互，需要安全的加密通信。同态加密虽能直接在加密数据上计算，但文本生成特别是下一个令牌预测仍是实际应用的主要障碍

Method: 采用基于旅行商问题(TSP)的令牌重排序策略，结合后处理步骤进一步减少近似误差

Result: 理论分析和实验结果表明，该方法防止崩溃，提高生成文本的连贯性，并在整个过程中保持数据隐私

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了实用且保护隐私的LLM推理的可行性

Abstract: As users increasingly interact with large language models (LLMs) using
private information, secure and encrypted communication becomes essential.
Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a principled solution by enabling
computation directly on encrypted data. Although prior work has explored
aspects of running LLMs under HE, the challenge of text generation,
particularly next-token prediction, has received limited attention and remains
a key obstacle to practical encrypted interaction. In this work, we propose a
TSP-based token reordering strategy to address the difficulties of encrypted
text generation, together with a post-processing step that further reduces
approximation error. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate
that our method prevents collapse, improves coherence in generated text, and
preserves data privacy throughout. Overall, our contributions advance the
feasibility of practical and privacy-preserving LLM inference.

Conclusion: 当前方法在处理真实世界重尾数据时仍有限制，这推动了该领域的进一步研究需求。

Abstract: Ensuring data quality at scale remains a persistent challenge for large
organizations. Despite recent advances, maintaining accurate and consistent
data is still complex, especially when dealing with multiple data modalities.
Traditional error detection and correction methods tend to focus on a single
modality, typically a table, and often miss cross-modal errors that are common
in domains like e-Commerce and healthcare, where image, tabular, and text data
co-exist. To address this gap, we take an initial step towards cross-modal
error detection in tabular data, by benchmarking several methods. Our
evaluation spans four datasets and five baseline approaches. Among them,
Cleanlab, a label error detection framework, and DataScope, a data valuation
method, perform the best when paired with a strong AutoML framework, achieving
the highest F1 scores. Our findings indicate that current methods remain
limited, particularly when applied to heavy-tailed real-world data, motivating
further research in this area.

*Shengyin Sun,Chen Ma,Jiehao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于大规模异构图预训练GNN的有效框架，包含结构感知和语义感知预训练任务，解决异构图预训练中的语义不匹配问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN预训练方法主要针对同质图，而现实图多为异构图，且存在语义不匹配问题（原始数据与理想可迁移语义信息数据之间的差异）

Method: 设计结构感知预训练任务捕获异构图结构特性；设计语义感知预训练任务，构建由语义邻居组成的扰动子空间来处理语义不匹配

Result: 在真实世界大规模异构图上的广泛实验表明，该方法优于现有最先进基线方法

Conclusion: 所提出的框架能够有效预训练异构图神经网络，通过语义邻居使模型更关注语义空间的通用知识，从而学习具有更好可迁移性的知识

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have facilitated the
development of graph data mining. However, training GNNs requires sufficient
labeled task-specific data, which is expensive and sometimes unavailable. To be
less dependent on labeled data, recent studies propose to pre-train GNNs in a
self-supervised manner and then apply the pre-trained GNNs to downstream tasks
with limited labeled data. However, most existing methods are designed solely
for homogeneous graphs (real-world graphs are mostly heterogeneous) and do not
consider semantic mismatch (the semantic difference between the original data
and the ideal data containing more transferable semantic information). In this
paper, we propose an effective framework to pre-train GNNs on the large-scale
heterogeneous graph. We first design a structure-aware pre-training task, which
aims to capture structural properties in heterogeneous graphs. Then, we design
a semantic-aware pre-training task to tackle the mismatch. Specifically, we
construct a perturbation subspace composed of semantic neighbors to help deal
with the semantic mismatch. Semantic neighbors make the model focus more on the
general knowledge in the semantic space, which in turn assists the model in
learning knowledge with better transferability. Finally, extensive experiments
are conducted on real-world large-scale heterogeneous graphs to demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines. Code

### [206] [Cautious Weight Decay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12402)
*Lizhang Chen,Jonathan Li,Kaizhao Liang,Baiyu Su,Cong Xie,Nuo Wang Pierse,Chen Liang,Ni Lao,Qiang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cautious Weight Decay (CWD) 是一种优化器无关的改进方法，仅在参数坐标与优化器更新方向一致时应用权重衰减，无需额外超参数即可提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准解耦权重衰减会隐式优化正则化或约束目标，而CWD旨在保持原始损失函数不变，寻找未修改目标的局部帕累托最优驻点。

Method: CWD是一种一行代码的修改，仅对与优化器更新方向一致的参数坐标应用权重衰减，可视为双层优化问题，在到达平稳流形时诱导滑动模式行为。

Result: 在语言模型预训练和ImageNet分类任务中，CWD在百万到十亿参数规模下持续改善最终损失和准确率。

Conclusion: CWD是AdamW、Lion和Muon等优化器的即插即用改进，无需新超参数或额外调优即可提升性能。

Abstract: We introduce Cautious Weight Decay (CWD), a one-line, optimizer-agnostic
modification that applies weight decay only to parameter coordinates whose
signs align with the optimizer update. Unlike standard decoupled decay, which
implicitly optimizes a regularized or constrained objective, CWD preserves the
original loss and admits a bilevel interpretation: it induces sliding-mode
behavior upon reaching the stationary manifold, allowing it to search for
locally Pareto-optimal stationary points of the unmodified objective. In
practice, CWD is a drop-in change for optimizers such as AdamW, Lion, and Muon,
requiring no new hyperparameters or additional tuning. For language model
pre-training and ImageNet classification, CWD consistently improves final loss
and accuracy at million- to billion-parameter scales.

*Masahiro Negishi,Hyunsoo Park,Kinga O. Mastej,Aron Walsh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出使用两种连续距离函数来评估生成式AI模型在无机晶体材料生成中的独特性和新颖性，克服了传统距离函数的四个主要局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前用于评估晶体材料生成模型的传统距离函数存在四个关键问题：无法量化化合物间相似程度、不能区分成分差异和结构差异、缺乏对原子坐标变化的Lipschitz连续性、以及独特性指标对生成样本排列不具不变性。

Method: 提出两种连续距离函数来评估生成模型的独特性和新颖性，这些距离函数在理论上克服了传统方法的局限性。

Result: 实验表明，新提出的距离函数能够揭示传统距离函数所忽略的洞察，为无机晶体生成模型的评估和比较提供了更可靠的基础。

Conclusion: 连续距离函数为评估生成式AI模型在功能材料发现方面的性能提供了更准确和可靠的度量标准。

Abstract: To address pressing scientific challenges such as climate change,
increasingly sophisticated generative artificial intelligence models are being
developed that can efficiently sample the large chemical space of possible
functional materials. These models can quickly sample new chemical compositions
paired with crystal structures. They are typically evaluated using uniqueness
and novelty metrics, which depend on a chosen crystal distance function.
However, the most prevalent distance function has four limitations: it fails to
quantify the degree of similarity between compounds, cannot distinguish
compositional difference and structural difference, lacks Lipschitz continuity
against shifts in atomic coordinates, and results in a uniqueness metric that
is not invariant against the permutation of generated samples. In this work, we
propose using two continuous distance functions to evaluate uniqueness and
novelty, which theoretically overcome these limitations. Our experiments show
that these distances reveal insights missed by traditional distance functions,
providing a more reliable basis for evaluating and comparing generative models
for inorganic crystals.

*Anush Anand,Pranav Agrawal,Tejas Bodas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于高斯过程的非参数化动态定价方法，使用贝叶斯优化来学习未知需求函数，在无限和有限库存场景下都优于传统强化学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态定价方法通常假设需求函数具有特定参数形式，这在现实场景中可能不成立，限制了方法的适用性。需要一种不依赖严格建模假设的方法。

Method: 使用高斯过程对需求函数进行非参数建模，将其视为价格的未知黑盒函数，基于贝叶斯优化开发定价算法，适用于无限和有限库存两种场景。

Result: 通过大量实验证明，基于BO的方法在收入方面优于多种最先进的RL算法，需要更少的假设且具有更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯优化是复杂不确定环境中动态定价的强大实用工具，提供了学习效率的理论保证。

Abstract: Dynamic pricing is the practice of adjusting the selling price of a product
to maximize a firm's revenue by responding to market demand. The literature
typically distinguishes between two settings: infinite inventory, where the
firm has unlimited stock and time to sell, and finite inventory, where both
inventory and selling horizon are limited. In both cases, the central challenge
lies in the fact that the demand function -- how sales respond to price -- is
unknown and must be learned from data. Traditional approaches often assume a
specific parametric form for the demand function, enabling the use of
reinforcement learning (RL) to identify near-optimal pricing strategies.
However, such assumptions may not hold in real-world scenarios, limiting the
applicability of these methods. In this work, we propose a Gaussian Process
(GP) based nonparametric approach to dynamic pricing that avoids restrictive
modeling assumptions. We treat the demand function as a black-box function of
the price and develop pricing algorithms based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) --
a sample-efficient method for optimizing unknown functions. We present BO-based
algorithms tailored for both infinite and finite inventory settings and provide
regret guarantees for both regimes, thereby quantifying the learning efficiency
of our methods. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our BO-based
methods outperform several state-of-the-art RL algorithms in terms of revenue,
while requiring fewer assumptions and offering greater robustness. This
highlights Bayesian Optimization as a powerful and practical tool for dynamic
pricing in complex, uncertain environments.

*Israel Mason-Williams,Gabryel Mason-Williams,Helen Yannakoudakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了平坦最小值与泛化能力的关系，发现正则化方法（如SAM、权重衰减、数据增强）往往产生更尖锐的最小值，但这些尖锐最小值反而与更好的泛化、校准、鲁棒性和功能一致性相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平坦最小值与泛化能力的关联在近期研究中被证明更加复杂，存在理论反例和实证例外。本文旨在重新理解尖锐度在模型性能中的作用。

Method: 进行了广泛的实证研究，从单目标优化到现代图像分类任务，比较了使用不同正则化方法（SAM、权重衰减、数据增强）的模型。

Result: 发现正则化模型倾向于收敛到更尖锐的最小值，但这些尖锐最小值在泛化、校准、鲁棒性和功能一致性方面表现更好；而无正则化的基线模型虽然收敛到更平坦的最小值，但在所有安全指标上表现更差。

Conclusion: 函数复杂性而非平坦度单独决定了解的几何形状，尖锐最小值可以反映更合适的归纳偏置（特别是在正则化下），需要对损失景观几何进行以函数为中心的重新评估。

Abstract: Flat minima are widely believed to correlate with improved generalisation in
deep neural networks. However, this connection has proven more nuanced in
recent studies, with both theoretical counterexamples and empirical exceptions
emerging in the literature. In this paper, we revisit the role of sharpness in
model performance, proposing that sharpness is better understood as a
function-dependent property rather than a reliable indicator of poor
generalisation. We conduct extensive empirical studies, from single-objective
optimisation to modern image classification tasks, showing that sharper minima
often emerge when models are regularised (e.g., via SAM, weight decay, or data
augmentation), and that these sharp minima can coincide with better
generalisation, calibration, robustness, and functional consistency. Across a
range of models and datasets, we find that baselines without regularisation
tend to converge to flatter minima yet often perform worse across all safety
metrics. Our findings demonstrate that function complexity, rather than
flatness alone, governs the geometry of solutions, and that sharper minima can
reflect more appropriate inductive biases (especially under regularisation),
calling for a function-centric reappraisal of loss landscape geometry.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了TCVBM框架，将Bridge Matching扩展到时间相关视频序列，通过显式建模序列间依赖关系来保持时间一致性，在视频帧插值、图像到视频生成和视频超分辨率任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型擅长从噪声生成数据，但在复杂分布间的数据转换任务中表现不佳。Bridge Matching模型虽然解决了分布间转换问题，但尚未应用于时间相关数据序列，而视频任务对时间一致性有严格要求。

Method: TCVBM框架扩展Bridge Matching到时间相关视频序列，在扩散桥中显式建模序列间依赖关系，直接将时间相关性纳入采样过程。

Result: 在视频帧插值、图像到视频生成和视频超分辨率三个任务中，TCVBM在多个定量指标上优于基于bridge matching和扩散模型的传统方法，展现出更好的生成质量和重建保真度。

Conclusion: TCVBM成功将Bridge Matching扩展到时间相关视频序列，通过显式建模时间相关性显著提升了视频任务的性能，为视频生成和操作任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel in noise-to-data generation tasks, providing a mapping
from a Gaussian distribution to a more complex data distribution. However they
struggle to model translations between complex distributions, limiting their
effectiveness in data-to-data tasks. While Bridge Matching (BM) models address
this by finding the translation between data distributions, their application
to time-correlated data sequences remains unexplored. This is a critical
limitation for video generation and manipulation tasks, where maintaining
temporal coherence is particularly important. To address this gap, we propose
Time-Correlated Video Bridge Matching (TCVBM), a framework that extends BM to
time-correlated data sequences in the video domain. TCVBM explicitly models
inter-sequence dependencies within the diffusion bridge, directly incorporating
temporal correlations into the sampling process. We compare our approach to
classical methods based on bridge matching and diffusion models for three
video-related tasks: frame interpolation, image-to-video generation, and video
super-resolution. TCVBM achieves superior performance across multiple
quantitative metrics, demonstrating enhanced generation quality and
reconstruction fidelity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出CrossAD框架，通过跨尺度关联和跨窗口建模进行时间序列异常检测，在多尺度建模中显式捕捉跨尺度关联，并利用查询库和全局上下文克服固定窗口限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多尺度建模时往往独立处理各尺度信息或使用简单特征融合，忽略了异常发生时跨尺度关联的动态变化，且大多基于固定滑动窗口，限制了上下文信息的全面捕捉。

Method: 提出跨尺度重构方法，从粗粒度序列重构细粒度序列以显式捕捉跨尺度关联；设计查询库并融入全局多尺度上下文，克服固定窗口大小的限制。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上使用9个评估指标进行广泛实验，验证了CrossAD的有效性，在异常检测任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CrossAD框架通过有效建模跨尺度关联和跨窗口上下文，显著提升了时间序列异常检测的性能，为多尺度建模提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection plays a crucial role in a wide range of
real-world applications. Given that time series data can exhibit different
patterns at different sampling granularities, multi-scale modeling has proven
beneficial for uncovering latent anomaly patterns that may not be apparent at a
single scale. However, existing methods often model multi-scale information
independently or rely on simple feature fusion strategies, neglecting the
dynamic changes in cross-scale associations that occur during anomalies.
Moreover, most approaches perform multi-scale modeling based on fixed sliding
windows, which limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual
information. In this work, we propose CrossAD, a novel framework for time
series Anomaly Detection that takes Cross-scale associations and Cross-window
modeling into account. We propose a cross-scale reconstruction that
reconstructs fine-grained series from coarser series, explicitly capturing
cross-scale associations. Furthermore, we design a query library and
incorporate global multi-scale context to overcome the limitations imposed by
fixed window sizes. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world
datasets using nine evaluation metrics validate the effectiveness of CrossAD,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection.

TL;DR: 提出PubSub-VFL，一种基于发布/订阅架构的新型垂直联邦学习范式，通过分层异步机制显著提升训练效率和资源利用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统两方分割学习（垂直联邦学习）中计算资源利用率低、训练效率差的问题，特别是同步依赖设计导致的训练延迟，以及参与方资源数据异构性带来的计算效率障碍。

Method: 利用发布/订阅架构的解耦能力和参数服务器架构的数据并行性，设计分层异步机制；基于参与方系统配置文件构建优化问题，选择最优超参数同时保护隐私。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的实验表明，相比最先进基线方法，PubSub-VFL在不损失准确率的情况下加速训练2-7倍，计算资源利用率高达91.07%。

Conclusion: PubSub-VFL通过创新的发布/订阅架构和分层异步机制，有效解决了垂直联邦学习中的效率和资源利用问题，具有稳定的收敛性和安全协议兼容性。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of the digital economy, data collaboration between
organizations has become a well-established business model, driving the growth
of various industries. However, privacy concerns make direct data sharing
impractical. To address this, Two-Party Split Learning (a.k.a. Vertical
Federated Learning (VFL)) has emerged as a promising solution for secure
collaborative learning. Despite its advantages, this architecture still suffers
from low computational resource utilization and training efficiency.
Specifically, its synchronous dependency design increases training latency,
while resource and data heterogeneity among participants further hinder
efficient computation. To overcome these challenges, we propose PubSub-VFL, a
novel VFL paradigm with a Publisher/Subscriber architecture optimized for
two-party collaborative learning with high computational efficiency. PubSub-VFL
leverages the decoupling capabilities of the Pub/Sub architecture and the data
parallelism of the parameter server architecture to design a hierarchical
asynchronous mechanism, reducing training latency and improving system
efficiency. Additionally, to mitigate the training imbalance caused by resource
and data heterogeneity, we formalize an optimization problem based on
participants' system profiles, enabling the selection of optimal
hyperparameters while preserving privacy. We conduct a theoretical analysis to
demonstrate that PubSub-VFL achieves stable convergence and is compatible with
security protocols such as differential privacy. Extensive case studies on five
benchmark datasets further validate its effectiveness, showing that, compared
to state-of-the-art baselines, PubSub-VFL not only accelerates training by $2
\sim 7\times$ without compromising accuracy, but also achieves a computational
resource utilization rate of up to 91.07%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文发现扩散模型中存在噪声偏移问题，即预定义噪声水平与采样过程中间状态实际噪声水平不匹配，并提出噪声感知引导(NAG)方法进行校正，显著提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去噪生成模型存在一个长期被忽视但普遍的问题：预定义噪声水平与采样过程中间状态实际编码的噪声水平不匹配，这种噪声偏移会导致次优生成结果。

Method: 提出噪声感知引导(NAG)方法，明确引导采样轨迹与预定义噪声调度保持一致；还引入无分类器版本的NAG，通过噪声条件丢弃联合训练噪声条件和非条件模型。

Result: 在ImageNet生成和各种监督微调任务上的广泛实验表明，NAG能持续缓解噪声偏移，显著提升主流扩散模型的生成质量。

Conclusion: 噪声偏移是扩散模型中的普遍问题，NAG提供了一种简单有效的校正方法，无需外部分类器即可改善生成性能。

Abstract: Existing denoising generative models rely on solving discretized reverse-time
SDEs or ODEs. In this paper, we identify a long-overlooked yet pervasive issue
in this family of models: a misalignment between the pre-defined noise level
and the actual noise level encoded in intermediate states during sampling. We
refer to this misalignment as noise shift. Through empirical analysis, we
demonstrate that noise shift is widespread in modern diffusion models and
exhibits a systematic bias, leading to sub-optimal generation due to both
out-of-distribution generalization and inaccurate denoising updates. To address
this problem, we propose Noise Awareness Guidance (NAG), a simple yet effective
correction method that explicitly steers sampling trajectories to remain
consistent with the pre-defined noise schedule. We further introduce a
classifier-free variant of NAG, which jointly trains a noise-conditional and a
noise-unconditional model via noise-condition dropout, thereby eliminating the
need for external classifiers. Extensive experiments, including ImageNet
generation and various supervised fine-tuning tasks, show that NAG consistently
mitigates noise shift and substantially improves the generation quality of
mainstream diffusion models.

Conclusion: 本文旨在为因果发现的合理评估提供标准，并进一步促进其在真实世界场景中的应用。

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to learn causal relationships between variables from
targeted data, making it a fundamental task in machine learning. However,
causal discovery algorithms often rely on unverifiable causal assumptions,
which are usually difficult to satisfy in real-world data, thereby limiting the
broad application of causal discovery in practical scenarios. Inspired by these
considerations, this work extensively benchmarks the empirical performance of
various mainstream causal discovery algorithms, which assume i.i.d. data, under
eight model assumption violations. Our experimental results show that
differentiable causal discovery methods exhibit robustness under the metrics of
Structural Hamming Distance and Structural Intervention Distance of the
inferred graphs in commonly used challenging scenarios, except for scale
variation. We also provide the theoretical explanations for the performance of
differentiable causal discovery methods. Finally, our work aims to
comprehensively benchmark the performance of recent differentiable causal
discovery methods under model assumption violations, and provide the standard
for reasonable evaluation of causal discovery, as well as to further promote
its application in real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 解决现实应用中需要在上下文变化下实现公平收入分配的问题，其中跨上下文的最小奖励约束聚合带来了技术挑战，特别是缺乏标准MAB设置中常见的闭式最优分配。

Method: 设计并分析两种算法：乐观优先考虑性能的算法和悲观强制约束满足的算法。为每种算法推导了关于遗憾和约束违反的问题依赖性上界。

Conclusion: 该研究为具有跨上下文最小奖励约束的多臂老虎机问题提供了有效的算法解决方案，并建立了理论保证，揭示了此类问题的基本限制。

Abstract: We examine a multi-armed bandit problem with contextual information, where
the objective is to ensure that each arm receives a minimum aggregated reward
across contexts while simultaneously maximizing the total cumulative reward.
This framework captures a broad class of real-world applications where fair
revenue allocation is critical and contextual variation is inherent. The
cross-context aggregation of minimum reward constraints, while enabling better
performance and easier feasibility, introduces significant technical challenges
-- particularly the absence of closed-form optimal allocations typically
available in standard MAB settings. We design and analyze algorithms that
either optimistically prioritize performance or pessimistically enforce
constraint satisfaction. For each algorithm, we derive problem-dependent upper
bounds on both regret and constraint violations. Furthermore, we establish a
lower bound demonstrating that the dependence on the time horizon in our
results is optimal in general and revealing fundamental limitations of the free
exploration principle leveraged in prior work.

Abstract: Cross-silo federated learning (FL) is a promising approach to enable
cross-organization collaboration in machine learning model development without
directly sharing private data. Despite growing organizational interest driven
by data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, the adoption of
cross-silo FL remains limited in practice. In this paper, we conduct an
interview study to understand the practical challenges associated with
cross-silo FL adoption. With interviews spanning a diverse set of stakeholders
such as user organizations, software providers, and academic researchers, we
uncover various barriers, from concerns about model performance to questions of
incentives and trust between participating organizations. Our study shows that
cross-silo FL faces a set of challenges that have yet to be well-captured by
existing research in the area and are quite distinct from other forms of
federated learning such as cross-device FL. We end with a discussion on future
research directions that can help overcome these challenges.

Method: 采用假设检验、控制组和随机控制蒸馏方法，分析多种蒸馏变体和模型规模下的蒸馏缩放规律。

Result: 在某些模态和架构中存在统计显著的知识转移，但程度低于预期；显著知识转移时存在严重的负面知识不对称转移。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏主要作为数据依赖的规范化器而非压缩机制，存在负面不对称回报，引发安全担忧。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is often considered a compression mechanism when
judged on the resulting student's accuracy and loss, yet its functional impact
is poorly understood. In this work, we quantify the compression capacity of
knowledge distillation and the resulting knowledge transfer from a functional
perspective, decoupling compression from architectural reduction, which
provides an improved understanding of knowledge distillation. We employ
hypothesis testing, controls, and random control distillation to understand
knowledge transfer mechanisms across data modalities. To rigorously test the
breadth and limits of our analyses, we explore multiple distillation variants
and analyse distillation scaling laws across model sizes. Our findings
demonstrate that, while there is statistically significant knowledge transfer
in some modalities and architectures, the extent of this transfer is less
pronounced than anticipated, even under conditions designed to maximise
knowledge sharing. Notably, in cases of significant knowledge transfer, we
identify a consistent and severe asymmetric transfer of negative knowledge to
the student, raising safety concerns in knowledge distillation applications.
Across 12 experimental setups, 9 architectures, and 7 datasets, our findings
show that knowledge distillation functions less as a compression mechanism and
more as a data-dependent regulariser with a negative asymmetric payoff.

Conclusion: 该方法为快速可重用的粗粒化流程提供了潜力，通过解耦动力学推断和表示学习提高了训练稳定性

Abstract: High-dimensional recordings of dynamical processes are often characterized by
a much smaller set of effective variables, evolving on low-dimensional
manifolds. Identifying these latent dynamics requires solving two intertwined
problems: discovering appropriate coarse-grained variables and simultaneously
fitting the governing equations. Most machine learning approaches tackle these
tasks jointly by training autoencoders together with models that enforce
dynamical consistency. We propose to decouple the two problems by leveraging
the recently introduced Foundation Inference Models (FIMs). FIMs are pretrained
models that estimate the infinitesimal generators of dynamical systems (e.g.,
the drift and diffusion of a stochastic differential equation) in zero-shot
mode. By amortizing the inference of the dynamics through a FIM with frozen
weights, and training only the encoder-decoder map, we define a simple,
simulation-consistent loss that stabilizes representation learning. A proof of
concept on a stochastic double-well system with semicircle diffusion, embedded
into synthetic video data, illustrates the potential of this approach for fast
and reusable coarse-graining pipelines.

*Yuta Kobayashi,Zilin Jing,Jiayu Yao,Hongseok Namkoong,Shalmali Joshi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了元主动特征获取（meta-AFA）问题和Learning-to-Measure（L2M）方法，通过跨任务学习特征获取策略，在标签稀缺和高缺失率情况下优于任务特定基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统主动特征获取方法局限于单一任务、缺乏可扩展性的问题，利用回顾性数据中的系统性缺失特征和有限标签来学习跨任务的特征获取策略。

Method: L2M包含两个核心组件：1）对未见任务的可靠不确定性量化；2）基于不确定性的贪婪特征获取代理，最大化条件互信息。采用序列建模或自回归预训练方法支持任意缺失模式下的不确定性量化。

Result: 在合成和真实世界表格数据基准测试中，L2M匹配或超越了任务特定基线方法，特别是在标签稀缺和高缺失率情况下表现更优。

Conclusion: L2M能够直接在具有回顾性缺失的数据集上运行，通过上下文学习执行元AFA任务，无需针对每个任务重新训练，展示了在跨任务特征获取中的有效性。

Abstract: Active feature acquisition (AFA) is a sequential decision-making problem
where the goal is to improve model performance for test instances by adaptively
selecting which features to acquire. In practice, AFA methods often learn from
retrospective data with systematic missingness in the features and limited
task-specific labels. Most prior work addresses acquisition for a single
predetermined task, limiting scalability. To address this limitation, we
formalize the meta-AFA problem, where the goal is to learn acquisition policies
across various tasks. We introduce Learning-to-Measure (L2M), which consists of
i) reliable uncertainty quantification over unseen tasks, and ii) an
uncertainty-guided greedy feature acquisition agent that maximizes conditional
mutual information. We demonstrate a sequence-modeling or autoregressive
pre-training approach that underpins reliable uncertainty quantification for
tasks with arbitrary missingness. L2M operates directly on datasets with
retrospective missingness and performs the meta-AFA task in-context,
eliminating per-task retraining. Across synthetic and real-world tabular
benchmarks, L2M matches or surpasses task-specific baselines, particularly
under scarce labels and high missingness.

TL;DR: Laminar是一个可扩展的强化学习后训练系统，通过轨迹级异步和完全解耦架构解决了RL训练中的长尾延迟问题，显著提升了训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL框架在扩展性上存在限制，由于RL轨迹生成的极端长尾偏斜导致GPU利用率低下，全局权重同步机制不适应RL训练中高度偏斜且不断变化的轨迹生成延迟分布。

Method: 提出Laminar系统：1）用中继工作者层替代全局更新，实现分布式参数服务；2）动态重新打包机制将长尾轨迹整合到专用rollout上；3）完全解耦设计隔离故障。

Result: 在1024-GPU集群上的评估显示，Laminar相比最先进系统实现了最高5.48倍的训练吞吐量加速，同时减少了模型收敛时间。

Conclusion: 轨迹级异步和完全解耦架构是高效扩展RL后训练的关键，Laminar系统在可扩展性和鲁棒性方面表现出色。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training for Large Language Models (LLMs) is
now scaling to large clusters and running for extended durations to enhance
model reasoning performance. However, the scalability of existing RL frameworks
is limited, as extreme long-tail skewness in RL trajectory generation causes
severe GPU underutilization. Current asynchronous RL systems attempt to
mitigate this, but they rely on global weight synchronization between the actor
and all rollouts, which creates a rigid model update schedule. This global
synchronization is ill-suited for the highly skewed and evolving distribution
of trajectory generation latency in RL training, crippling training efficiency.
Our key insight is that efficient scaling requires breaking this lockstep
through trajectory-level asynchrony, which generates and consumes each
trajectory independently. We propose Laminar, a scalable and robust RL
post-training system built on a fully decoupled architecture. First, we replace
global updates with a tier of relay workers acting as a distributed parameter
service. This enables asynchronous and fine-grained weight synchronization,
allowing rollouts to pull the latest weight anytime without stalling the
actor's training loop. Second, a dynamic repack mechanism consolidates
long-tail trajectories onto a few dedicated rollouts, maximizing generation
throughput. The fully decoupled design also isolates failures, ensuring
robustness for long-running jobs. Our evaluation on a 1024-GPU cluster shows
that Laminar achieves up to 5.48$\times$ training throughput speedup over
state-of-the-art systems, while reducing model convergence time.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Bellman Wasserstein距离（BWD），一种无需训练智能体即可评估离线强化学习数据集质量的方法。BWD通过行为评论家和状态条件最优传输来衡量数据集行为策略与随机参考策略的差异，能有效预测离线RL算法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习依赖于静态数据集，但数据集质量差异很大，从专家轨迹到随机轨迹不等。在不知道数据来源和技能组成的情况下，很难预先评估数据集质量，这影响了算法选择。

Method: 研究了从简单累积奖励到基于学习价值估计器的多种代理指标，并引入了BWD——一种价值感知的最优传输评分方法。BWD通过行为评论家和状态条件最优传输公式计算，无需环境交互或完整策略优化。

Result: 在D4RL MuJoCo任务中，BWD与聚合多个离线RL算法的oracle性能得分强相关，能有效预测标准智能体在给定数据集上的表现。将BWD作为正则化器还能在策略优化中提高回报。

Conclusion: 价值感知的分布信号如BWD是筛选离线RL数据集和优化策略的实用工具，能够在不训练智能体的情况下评估数据集质量并改进策略学习。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) learns exclusively from static datasets,
without further interaction with the environment. In practice, such datasets
vary widely in quality, often mixing expert, suboptimal, and even random
trajectories. The choice of algorithm therefore depends on dataset fidelity.
Behavior cloning can suffice on high-quality data, whereas mixed- or
low-quality data typically benefits from offline RL methods that stitch useful
behavior across trajectories. Yet in the wild it is difficult to assess dataset
quality a priori because the data's provenance and skill composition are
unknown. We address the problem of estimating offline dataset quality without
training an agent. We study a spectrum of proxies from simple cumulative
rewards to learned value based estimators, and introduce the Bellman
Wasserstein distance (BWD), a value aware optimal transport score that measures
how dissimilar a dataset's behavioral policy is from a random reference policy.
BWD is computed from a behavioral critic and a state conditional OT
formulation, requiring no environment interaction or full policy optimization.
Across D4RL MuJoCo tasks, BWD strongly correlates with an oracle performance
score that aggregates multiple offline RL algorithms, enabling efficient
prediction of how well standard agents will perform on a given dataset. Beyond
prediction, integrating BWD as a regularizer during policy optimization
explicitly pushes the learned policy away from random behavior and improves
returns. These results indicate that value aware, distributional signals such
as BWD are practical tools for triaging offline RL datasets and policy
optimization.

TL;DR: 当前混合思维LLMs存在模式分离不彻底的问题，推理行为会泄露到非思考模式中。本文提出了改善可控性的四个关键因素和两阶段训练策略，显著减少了非思考模式的输出长度和推理支持性token的出现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合思维LLMs在效率和推理能力之间提供了平衡，但现有模型只能实现部分模式分离，推理行为经常泄露到非思考模式中，需要理解和改善这种可控性问题。

Method: 分析了影响可控性的四个关键因素：(1)更大的数据规模，(2)使用不同问题的思考和非思考答案而非同一问题，(3)适度增加非思考数据数量，(4)两阶段策略（先训练推理能力，再应用混合思维训练）。基于这些发现提出了实用的训练方案。

Result: 相比标准训练，提出的方法能在保持两种模式准确性的同时，显著减少非思考模式输出长度（在MATH500上从1085降至585）和推理支持性token如"wait"的出现（在MATH500上从5917降至522）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前混合思维的局限性，并为加强其可控性提供了方向，提出的训练方案能有效改善模式分离问题。

Abstract: Hybrid thinking enables LLMs to switch between reasoning and direct
answering, offering a balance between efficiency and reasoning capability. Yet
our experiments reveal that current hybrid thinking LLMs only achieve partial
mode separation: reasoning behaviors often leak into the no-think mode. To
understand and mitigate this, we analyze the factors influencing
controllability and identify four that matter most: (1) larger data scale, (2)
using think and no-think answers from different questions rather than the same
question, (3) a moderate increase in no-think data number, and (4) a two-phase
strategy that first trains reasoning ability and then applies hybrid think
training. Building on these findings, we propose a practical recipe that,
compared to standard training, can maintain accuracy in both modes while
significantly reducing no-think output length (from $1085$ to $585$ on MATH500)
and occurrences of reasoning-supportive tokens such as ``\texttt{wait}'' (from
$5917$ to $522$ on MATH500). Our findings highlight the limitations of current
hybrid thinking and offer directions for strengthening its controllability.

Method: 训练一个基础模型，在数百万个模拟事件序列上学习事件的底层模式，获得对事件如何展开的通用理解。模型可以通过查看少量示例或快速微调来分析新数据。

Result: 该模型能够即时分析新的科学数据，无需重新训练，并且可以通过快速微调获得更高的准确性。

Conclusion: 这种方法使复杂的事件分析更加易于获取，并加速了科学发现的步伐。

Abstract: Many scientific fields, from medicine to seismology, rely on analyzing
sequences of events over time to understand complex systems. Traditionally,
machine learning models must be built and trained from scratch for each new
dataset, which is a slow and costly process. We introduce a new approach: a
single, powerful model that learns the underlying patterns of event data in
context. We trained this "foundation model" on millions of simulated event
sequences, teaching it a general-purpose understanding of how events can
unfold. As a result, our model can analyze new scientific data instantly,
without retraining, simply by looking at a few examples from the dataset. It
can also be quickly fine-tuned for even higher accuracy. This approach makes
sophisticated event analysis more accessible and accelerates the pace of
scientific discovery.

Abstract: Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describe dynamical systems evolving
deterministically in continuous time. Accurate data-driven modeling of systems
as ODEs, a central problem across the natural sciences, remains challenging,
especially if the data is sparse or noisy. We introduce FIM-ODE (Foundation
Inference Model for ODEs), a pretrained neural model designed to estimate ODEs
zero-shot (i.e., in context) from sparse and noisy observations. Trained on
synthetic data, the model utilizes a flexible neural operator for robust ODE
inference, even from corrupted data. We empirically verify that FIM-ODE
provides accurate estimates, on par with a neural state-of-the-art method, and
qualitatively compare the structure of their estimated vector fields.

TL;DR: SG-XDEAT是一个用于表格数据监督学习的新框架，通过双流编码器将特征分解为原始值和目标感知两个并行表示，结合跨维度、跨编码自注意力和自适应稀疏自注意力机制来提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的表格数据深度学习方法在处理特征交互和噪声过滤方面存在不足，需要一种能够同时建模原始特征和目标感知特征、并能自适应抑制噪声的框架。

Method: 采用双流编码器将特征分解为原始值流和目标感知流，通过跨维度自注意力捕获流内特征依赖，跨编码自注意力实现双流交互，自适应稀疏自注意力机制动态抑制低效用标记。

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中，SG-XDEAT相比强基线方法取得了持续的性能提升，验证了联合建模原始和目标感知视图并自适应过滤噪声的有效性。

Conclusion: SG-XDEAT通过双流表示学习和自适应噪声抑制机制，构建了更鲁棒的深度表格学习器，在表格数据监督学习任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We propose SG-XDEAT (Sparsity-Guided Cross Dimensional and Cross-Encoding
Attention with Target Aware Conditioning), a novel framework designed for
supervised learning on tabular data. At its core, SG-XDEAT employs a
dual-stream encoder that decomposes each input feature into two parallel
representations: a raw value stream and a target-conditioned (label-aware)
stream. These dual representations are then propagated through a hierarchical
stack of attention-based modules. SG-XDEAT integrates three key components: (i)
Cross-Dimensional self-attention, which captures intra-view dependencies among
features within each stream; (ii) Cross-Encoding self-attention, which enables
bidirectional interaction between raw and target-aware representations; and
(iii) an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) mechanism, which dynamically
suppresses low-utility tokens by driving their attention weights toward
zero--thereby mitigating the impact of noise. Empirical results on multiple
public benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, confirming that
jointly modeling raw and target-aware views--while adaptively filtering
noise--yields a more robust deep tabular learner.

Abstract: Whisper models have achieved remarkable progress in speech recognition; yet
their large size remains a bottleneck for deployment on resource-constrained
edge devices. This paper proposes a framework to design fine-tuned variants of

the Sparse Group LASSO penalty as a loss regularizer, to reduce the number of

Conclusion: 在强聚类性条件下，均匀采样具有结构感知能力，这是首个证明均匀边采样足以保持结构保持谱聚类的理论保证。

Abstract: Spectral clustering is a fundamental method for graph partitioning, but its
reliance on eigenvector computation limits scalability to massive graphs.
Classical sparsification methods preserve spectral properties by sampling edges
proportionally to their effective resistances, but require expensive
preprocessing to estimate these resistances. We study whether uniform edge
sampling-a simple, structure-agnostic strategy-can suffice for spectral
clustering. Our main result shows that for graphs admitting a well-separated
$k$-clustering, characterized by a large structure ratio $\Upsilon(k) =
\lambda_{k+1} / \rho_G(k)$, uniform sampling preserves the spectral subspace
used for clustering. Specifically, we prove that uniformly sampling $O(\gamma^2
n \log n / \epsilon^2)$ edges, where $\gamma$ is the Laplacian condition
number, yields a sparsifier whose top $(n-k)$-dimensional eigenspace is
approximately orthogonal to the cluster indicators. This ensures that the
spectral embedding remains faithful, and clustering quality is preserved. Our
analysis introduces new resistance bounds for intra-cluster edges, a
rank-$(n-k)$ effective resistance formulation, and a matrix Chernoff bound
adapted to the dominant eigenspace. These tools allow us to bypass importance
sampling entirely. Conceptually, our result connects recent coreset-based
clustering theory to spectral sparsification, showing that under strong
clusterability, even uniform sampling is structure-aware. This provides the
first provable guarantee that uniform edge sampling suffices for
structure-preserving spectral clustering.

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown significant impact through
their model capacity, scalability, and zero-shot generalization. However, due
to the heterogeneity of inter-variate dependencies and the backbone scalability
on large-scale multivariate datasets, most TSFMs are typically pre-trained on
univariate time series. This limitation renders them oblivious to crucial
information from diverse covariates in real-world forecasting tasks. To further
enhance the performance of TSFMs, we propose a general covariate-aware
adaptation (CoRA) framework for TSFMs. It leverages pre-trained backbones of
foundation models while effectively incorporating exogenous covariates from
various modalities, including time series, language, and images, to improve the
quality of predictions. Technically, CoRA maintains the equivalence of
initialization and parameter consistency during adaptation. With preserved
backbones of foundation models as frozen feature extractors, the outcome
embeddings from foundation models are empirically demonstrated more informative
than raw data. Further, CoRA employs a novel Granger Causality Embedding (GCE)
to automatically evaluate covariates regarding their causal predictability with
respect to the target variate. We incorporate these weighted embeddings with a
zero-initialized condition-injection mechanism, avoiding catastrophic
forgetting of pre-trained foundation models and gradually integrates exogenous
information. Extensive experiments show that CoRA of TSFMs surpasses
state-of-the-art covariate-aware deep forecasters with full or few-shot
training samples, achieving 31.1% MSE reduction on covariate-aware forecasting.
Compared to other adaptation methods, CoRA exhibits strong compatibility with
various advanced TSFMs and extends the scope of covariates to other modalities,
presenting a practical paradigm for the application of TSFMs.

Abstract: Abnormal stop detection (ASD) in intercity coach transportation is critical
for ensuring passenger safety, operational reliability, and regulatory
compliance. However, two key challenges hinder ASD effectiveness: sparse GPS
trajectories, which obscure short or unauthorized stops, and limited labeled
data, which restricts supervised learning. Existing methods often assume dense
sampling or regular movement patterns, limiting their applicability. To address
data sparsity, we propose a Sparsity-Aware Segmentation (SAS) method that
adaptively defines segment boundaries based on local spatial-temporal density.
Building upon these segments, we introduce three domain-specific indicators to
capture abnormal stop behaviors. To further mitigate the impact of sparsity, we
develop Locally Temporal-Indicator Guided Adjustment (LTIGA), which smooths
these indicators via local similarity graphs. To overcome label scarcity, we
construct a spatial-temporal graph where each segment is a node with
LTIGA-refined features. We apply label propagation to expand weak supervision
across the graph, followed by a GCN to learn relational patterns. A final
self-training module incorporates high-confidence pseudo-labels to iteratively
improve predictions. Experiments on real-world coach data show an AUC of 0.854
and AP of 0.866 using only 10 labeled instances, outperforming prior methods.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative priors for
high-dimensional inverse problems, yet learning them when only corrupted or
noisy observations are available remains challenging. In this work, we propose
a new method for training diffusion models with Expectation-Maximization (EM)
from corrupted data. Our proposed method, DiffEM, utilizes conditional
diffusion models to reconstruct clean data from observations in the E-step, and
then uses the reconstructed data to refine the conditional diffusion model in
the M-step. Theoretically, we provide monotonic convergence guarantees for the
DiffEM iteration, assuming appropriate statistical conditions. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on various image
reconstruction tasks.

Conclusion: ReLU神经网络的激活模式拓扑结构能够反映网络的决策行为和训练动态，为理解神经网络内部机制提供了新的几何视角。

Abstract: This paper explores the topological signatures of ReLU neural network
activation patterns. We consider feedforward neural networks with ReLU
activation functions and analyze the polytope decomposition of the feature
space induced by the network. Mainly, we investigate how the Fiedler partition
of the dual graph and show that it appears to correlate with the decision
boundary -- in the case of binary classification. Additionally, we compute the
homology of the cellular decomposition -- in a regression task -- to draw
similar patterns in behavior between the training loss and polyhedral
cell-count, as the model is trained.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在化学预训练图神经网络模型上进行多任务微调的方法，发现这种方法能显著提升药物发现中ADMET等关键属性的预测性能，特别是在大数据量时效果更明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 化学预训练模型在药物发现中具有潜力，多任务学习已被证明能改善预测模型。本文旨在探索在化学预训练模型上应用多任务微调是否能进一步提升性能。

Method: 使用KERMT（Kinetic GROVER Multi-Task）和KGPT（Knowledge-guided Pre-training of Graph Transformer）等化学预训练图神经网络模型，在多个ADMET任务上进行多任务微调，并与非预训练模型进行比较。

Result: 多任务微调显著优于非预训练图神经网络模型。令人惊讶的是，KERMT模型在大数据量时通过多任务微调获得的性能提升最为显著。

Conclusion: 在化学预训练模型上进行多任务微调是提升药物属性预测性能的有效方法，特别是在大数据场景下。作者还发布了两个多任务ADMET数据集分割和加速的KERMT实现，以促进该领域的发展。

Abstract: Chemical pretrained models, sometimes referred to as foundation models, are
receiving considerable interest for drug discovery applications. The general
chemical knowledge extracted from self-supervised training has the potential to
improve predictions for critical drug discovery endpoints, including on-target
potency and ADMET properties. Multi-task learning has previously been
successfully leveraged to improve predictive models. Here, we show that
enabling multitasking in finetuning of chemical pretrained graph neural network
models such as Kinetic GROVER Multi-Task (KERMT), an enhanced version of the
GROVER model, and Knowledge-guided Pre-training of Graph Transformer (KGPT)
significantly improves performance over non-pretrained graph neural network
models. Surprisingly, we find that the performance improvement from finetuning
KERMT in a multitask manner is most significant at larger data sizes.
Additionally, we publish two multitask ADMET data splits to enable more
accurate benchmarking of multitask deep learning methods for drug property
prediction. Finally, we provide an accelerated implementation of the KERMT
model on GitHub, unlocking large-scale pretraining, finetuning, and inference
in industrial drug discovery workflows.

*Dayin Gou,Sanghyun Byun,Nilesh Malpeddi,Gabrielle De Micheli,Prathamesh Vaste,Jacob Song,Woo Seong Chung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CARVQ是一种结合校正适配器和分组残差向量量化的后训练压缩方法，可将LLM嵌入层压缩至约1.6比特，无需专用硬件支持低比特存储，适用于边缘设备部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的词嵌入层参数众多，导致存储需求和内存占用巨大。在边缘设备上部署时，内存受限，压缩嵌入层可释放内存带宽并加速推理。

Method: 使用校正适配器结合分组残差向量量化，通过线性和非线性映射的组合来模拟原始模型嵌入，实现约1.6比特的压缩。

Result: 在多个预训练LLM上测试，包括生成、判别、数学和推理任务，CARVQ在大多数情况下能实现更低的平均比特宽度，同时保持合理的困惑度和准确率。

Conclusion: CARVQ是与最先进变换器量化方法兼容的新型压缩技术，可无缝集成到支持4位内存的任何硬件中，为LLM在边缘设备上的高效部署迈出关键一步。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) typically rely on a large number of parameters
for token embedding, leading to substantial storage requirements and memory
footprints. In particular, LLMs deployed on edge devices are memory-bound, and
reducing the memory footprint by compressing the embedding layer not only frees
up the memory bandwidth but also speeds up inference. To address this, we
introduce CARVQ, a post-training novel Corrective Adaptor combined with group
Residual Vector Quantization. CARVQ relies on the composition of both linear
and non-linear maps and mimics the original model embedding to compress to
approximately 1.6 bits without requiring specialized hardware to support
lower-bit storage. We test our method on pre-trained LLMs such as LLaMA-3.2-1B,
LLaMA-3.2-3B, LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct, LLaMA-3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B
and Phi-4, evaluating on common generative, discriminative, math and reasoning
tasks. We show that in most cases, CARVQ can achieve lower average
bitwidth-per-parameter while maintaining reasonable perplexity and accuracy
compared to scalar quantization. Our contributions include a novel compression
technique that is compatible with state-of-the-art transformer quantization
methods and can be seamlessly integrated into any hardware supporting 4-bit
memory to reduce the model's memory footprint in memory-constrained devices.
This work demonstrates a crucial step toward the efficient deployment of LLMs
on edge devices.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了决策树学习中的局部搜索操作（调整切割阈值或交换特征）对最小化分类错误的影响，发现这些问题在一般情况下是NP完全的，但通过参数化复杂度分析确定了使问题可处理的特性组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究决策树学习算法中常用的启发式局部搜索操作（调整切割阈值和交换特征）对分类错误最小化的影响，旨在理解这些操作的复杂性特征。

Method: 采用参数化复杂度分析方法，考虑特征数量d和域大小D等参数，证明问题在特定参数组合下是固定参数可解的，并开发了时间复杂度为(D+1)^(2d)·|I|^O(1)的算法。

Result: 发现当特征数量d和域大小D都很小时，问题变得固定参数可解，并提供了概念验证实现和实证结果。

Conclusion: 决策树局部搜索操作的最小化分类错误问题在一般情况下是NP完全的，但通过参数化分析找到了使问题可处理的关键参数组合，为实际应用提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Algorithms for learning decision trees often include heuristic local-search
operations such as (1) adjusting the threshold of a cut or (2) also exchanging
the feature of that cut. We study minimizing the number of classification
errors by performing a fixed number of a single type of these operations.
Although we discover that the corresponding problems are NP-complete in
general, we provide a comprehensive parameterized-complexity analysis with the
aim of determining those properties of the problems that explain the hardness
and those that make the problems tractable. For instance, we show that the
problems remain hard for a small number $d$ of features or small domain size
$D$ but the combination of both yields fixed-parameter tractability. That is,
the problems are solvable in $(D + 1)^{2d} \cdot |I|^{O(1)}$ time, where $|I|$
is the size of the input. We also provide a proof-of-concept implementation of
this algorithm and report on empirical results.

Motivation: 解决农业环境中异构农场环境和隐私敏感数据的问题，通过联邦学习在保护数据隐私的同时实现有效的作物产量预测。

Method: 三层分层架构：客户端为智能农场，中间层为作物特定聚合器，顶层为全局模型聚合器；采用季节性订阅机制，农场在每个农业季节开始时加入作物特定集群。

Result: 实验表明局部和作物层模型能紧密跟踪实际产量模式，显著优于标准机器学习模型，验证了分层联邦学习在农业环境中的优势。

Conclusion: 分层联邦学习架构在农业应用中具有显著优势，特别适用于异构农场环境和隐私敏感数据的场景，能有效平衡局部专业化和全局泛化需求。

Abstract: In this paper, we presents a novel hierarchical federated learning
architecture specifically designed for smart agricultural production systems
and crop yield prediction. Our approach introduces a seasonal subscription
mechanism where farms join crop-specific clusters at the beginning of each
agricultural season. The proposed three-layer architecture consists of
individual smart farms at the client level, crop-specific aggregators at the
middle layer, and a global model aggregator at the top level. Within each crop
cluster, clients collaboratively train specialized models tailored to specific
crop types, which are then aggregated to produce a higher-level global model
that integrates knowledge across multiple crops. This hierarchical design
enables both local specialization for individual crop types and global
generalization across diverse agricultural contexts while preserving data
privacy and reducing communication overhead. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed system, showing that local and crop-layer models
closely follow actual yield patterns with consistent alignment, significantly
outperforming standard machine learning models. The results validate the
advantages of hierarchical federated learning in the agricultural context,
particularly for scenarios involving heterogeneous farming environments and
privacy-sensitive agricultural data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UNIVERSE方法通过使用Rashomon集合（近似最优模型集合）来估计变量重要性，即使在存在缺失特征的情况下也能提供真实变量重要性的边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统变量重要性方法依赖于单一模型和观测到的特征，但变量重要性受模型中包含的其他变量影响，且观测数据中常缺失关键变量。此外，不同但性能相近的模型可能给出不同的变量重要性（Rashomon效应）。

Method: 引入UNIVERSE方法，通过构建Rashomon集合（数据集中近似最优的模型集合）来估计变量重要性，即使在存在未观测特征的情况下也能提供真实变量重要性的边界。

Result: 该方法在理论上具有鲁棒性保证，在半合成模拟中表现良好，并在信用风险任务中展示了实用性。

Conclusion: UNIVERSE方法能够解决传统变量重要性分析中的局限性，通过考虑模型不确定性和缺失特征，提供更可靠的变量重要性估计。

Abstract: Variable importance (VI) methods are often used for hypothesis generation,
feature selection, and scientific validation. In the standard VI pipeline, an
analyst estimates VI for a single predictive model with only the observed
features. However, the importance of a feature depends heavily on which other
variables are included in the model, and essential variables are often omitted
from observational datasets. Moreover, the VI estimated for one model is often
not the same as the VI estimated for another equally-good model - a phenomenon
known as the Rashomon Effect. We address these gaps by introducing
UNobservables and Inference for Variable importancE using Rashomon SEts
(UNIVERSE). Our approach adapts Rashomon sets - the sets of near-optimal models
in a dataset - to produce bounds on the true VI even with missing features. We
theoretically guarantee the robustness of our approach, show strong performance
on semi-synthetic simulations, and demonstrate its utility in a credit risk
task.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KoALA是一种无需语义信息、无需架构修改或对抗训练的轻量级对抗检测器，通过KL散度和L0相似度两种互补度量预测结果的一致性来检测对抗攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络极易受到对抗攻击，这对安全和关键应用构成重大风险。需要一种轻量级、即插即用的检测方案，无需修改现有模型架构或进行对抗训练。

Method: 使用KL散度（对密集低幅扰动敏感）和L0相似度（对稀疏高影响变化敏感）两种互补度量，当两种度量的类别预测不一致时检测为对抗攻击。仅需在预训练图像编码器上使用干净图像进行简单微调。

Result: 在ResNet/CIFAR-10上达到0.94精度和0.81召回率，在CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet上达到0.66精度和0.85召回率。当定理条件满足时能持续有效检测对抗样本。

Conclusion: KoALA是一个轻量级、即插即用的对抗检测解决方案，适用于现有模型和多种数据模态，为对抗攻击检测提供了有效的理论保证和实践方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, which
pose significant risks to security- and safety-critical applications. We
present KoALA (KL-L0 Adversarial detection via Label Agreement), a novel,
semantics-free adversarial detector that requires no architectural changes or
adversarial retraining. KoALA operates on a simple principle: it detects an
adversarial attack when class predictions from two complementary similarity
metrics disagree. These metrics-KL divergence and an L0-based similarity-are
specifically chosen to detect different types of perturbations. The KL
divergence metric is sensitive to dense, low-amplitude shifts, while the
L0-based similarity is designed for sparse, high-impact changes. We provide a
formal proof of correctness for our approach. The only training required is a
simple fine-tuning step on a pre-trained image encoder using clean images to
ensure the embeddings align well with both metrics. This makes KOALA a
lightweight, plug-and-play solution for existing models and various data
modalities. Our extensive experiments on ResNet/CIFAR-10 and CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet
confirm our theoretical claims. When the theorem's conditions are met, KoALA
consistently and effectively detects adversarial examples. On the full test
sets, KoALA achieves a precision of 0.94 and a recall of 0.81 on
ResNet/CIFAR-10, and a precision of 0.66 and a recall of 0.85 on
CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet.

### [240] [Sample-Efficient Omniprediction for Proper Losses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12769)
*Isaac Gibbs,Ryan J. Tibshirani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究如何构建概率预测器，使其在下游用户决策时能产生准确决策。针对多决策者场景，提出比现有方法更高效的算法来解决omniprediction问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有omniprediction算法存在两个问题：基于multicalibration的方法样本复杂度次优，基于对抗博弈的方法会产生复杂随机化预测器。需要设计更直接、非随机化的高效算法。

Method: 提出了一种直接的非随机化算法，利用proper loss集合的结构特性，避免了在线到批处理的转换，从而获得更简单的预测器。

Result: 证明了multicalibration比omniprediction更难，因此基于multicalibration的方法必然有次优样本复杂度。新算法在样本效率上有所改进。

Conclusion: 通过利用proper loss的结构特性，设计出了比现有方法更直接、非随机化的omniprediction算法，解决了复杂随机化预测器的问题。

Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing probabilistic predictions that lead
to accurate decisions when employed by downstream users to inform actions. For
a single decision maker, designing an optimal predictor is equivalent to
minimizing a proper loss function corresponding to the negative utility of that
individual. For multiple decision makers, our problem can be viewed as a
variant of omniprediction in which the goal is to design a single predictor
that simultaneously minimizes multiple losses. Existing algorithms for
achieving omniprediction broadly fall into two categories: 1) boosting methods
that optimize other auxiliary targets such as multicalibration and obtain
omniprediction as a corollary, and 2) adversarial two-player game based
approaches that estimate and respond to the ``worst-case" loss in an online
fashion. We give lower bounds demonstrating that multicalibration is a strictly
more difficult problem than omniprediction and thus the former approach must
incur suboptimal sample complexity. For the latter approach, we discuss how
these ideas can be used to obtain a sample-efficient algorithm through an
online-to-batch conversion. This conversion has the downside of returning a
complex, randomized predictor. We improve on this method by designing a more
direct, unrandomized algorithm that exploits structural elements of the set of
proper losses.

Motivation: 评估AI代理在具有文化意义的不完全信息多人纸牌游戏Dhumbal中的表现，为AI研究和文化游戏数字保存提供支持。

Method: 实现多种AI策略：基于规则的启发式方法（激进、保守、平衡、机会主义）、搜索方法（MCTS、ISMCTS）和强化学习方法（DQN、PPO），通过锦标赛进行系统评估。

Result: 在1024轮模拟中，基于规则的激进代理获得最高胜率（88.3%），显著优于ISMCTS（9.0%）和PPO（1.5%），主要通过有效利用Jhyap声明获胜。

Conclusion: 研究贡献了可复现的AI框架，展示了启发式方法在不完全信息下的有效性，并为文化游戏的数字保存提供了支持。

Abstract: This study evaluates Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents for Dhumbal, a
culturally significant multiplayer card game with imperfect information,
through a systematic comparison of rule-based, search-based, and learning-based
strategies. We formalize Dhumbal's mechanics and implement diverse agents,
including heuristic approaches (Aggressive, Conservative, Balanced,
Opportunistic), search-based methods such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and
Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search (ISMCTS), and reinforcement learning
approaches including Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO), and a random baseline. Evaluation involves within-category tournaments
followed by a cross-category championship. Performance is measured via win
rate, economic outcome, Jhyap success, cards discarded per round, risk
assessment, and decision efficiency. Statistical significance is assessed using
Welch's t-test with Bonferroni correction, effect sizes via Cohen's d, and 95%
confidence intervals (CI). Across 1024 simulated rounds, the rule-based
Aggressive agent achieves the highest win rate (88.3%, 95% CI: [86.3, 90.3]),
outperforming ISMCTS (9.0%) and PPO (1.5%) through effective exploitation of
Jhyap declarations. The study contributes a reproducible AI framework, insights
into heuristic efficacy under partial information, and open-source code,
thereby advancing AI research and supporting digital preservation of cultural
games.

TL;DR: 论文提出解决LLM作为评估者时存在严重正向偏差的问题，通过少数否决策略和回归框架来提升评估准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评估方法存在强烈正向偏差，虽然能准确识别有效输出，但对无效输出的识别能力很差，导致可靠性评分虚高。

Method: 提出最优少数否决策略和基于回归的框架，使用少量人工标注数据直接建模验证器偏差。

Result: 在366个高中Python程序的代码反馈任务中，回归方法将最大绝对误差降至1.2%，比14个最先进LLM的最佳集成性能提升2倍。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效缓解LLM评估者的正向偏差问题，显著提升评估准确性。

Abstract: New Large Language Models (LLMs) become available every few weeks, and modern
application developers confronted with the unenviable task of having to decide
if they should switch to a new model. While human evaluation remains the gold
standard, it is costly and unscalable. The state-of-the-art approach is to use
LLMs as evaluators ( LLM-as-a-judge), but this suffers from a critical flaw:
LLMs exhibit a strong positive bias. We provide empirical evidence showing that
while LLMs can identify valid outputs with high accuracy (i.e., True Positive
Rate 96%), they are remarkably poor at identifying invalid ones (i.e., True
Negative Rate <25%). This systematic bias, coupled with class imbalance, often
leads to inflated reliability scores.
  While ensemble-based methods like majority voting can help, we show that they
are not good enough. We introduce an optimal minority-veto strategy that is
resilient to missing data and mitigates this bias to a large extent. For
scenarios requiring even higher precision, we propose a novel regression-based
framework that directly models the validator bias using a small set of
human-annotated ground truth data. On a challenging code feedback task over 366
high-school Python programs, our regression approach reduces the maximum
absolute error to just 1.2%, achieving a 2x improvement over the
best-performing ensemble of 14 state-of-the-art LLMs.

Motivation: AI代理评估存在诸多挑战，影响对代理真实性能的理解，需要更全面可靠的评估方法。

Method: 1. 标准化评估框架，在数百个虚拟机上进行并行评估；2. 三维分析涵盖模型、框架和基准；3. LLM辅助日志检查发现未报告行为。

Abstract: AI agents have been developed for complex real-world tasks from coding to
customer service. But AI agent evaluations suffer from many challenges that
undermine our understanding of how well agents really work. We introduce the
Holistic Agent Leaderboard (HAL) to address these challenges. We make three
main contributions. First, we provide a standardized evaluation harness that
orchestrates parallel evaluations across hundreds of VMs, reducing evaluation
time from weeks to hours while eliminating common implementation bugs. Second,
we conduct three-dimensional analysis spanning models, scaffolds, and
benchmarks. We validate the harness by conducting 21,730 agent rollouts across
9 models and 9 benchmarks in coding, web navigation, science, and customer
service with a total cost of about $40,000. Our analysis reveals surprising
insights, such as higher reasoning effort reducing accuracy in the majority of
runs. Third, we use LLM-aided log inspection to uncover previously unreported
behaviors, such as searching for the benchmark on HuggingFace instead of
solving a task, or misusing credit cards in flight booking tasks. We share all
agent logs, comprising 2.5B tokens of language model calls, to incentivize
further research into agent behavior. By standardizing how the field evaluates
agents and addressing common pitfalls in agent evaluation, we hope to shift the
focus from agents that ace benchmarks to agents that work reliably in the real
world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基因变异解释方法耗时费力，需要自动化工具加速临床转化。现有基准测试任务过于狭窄，无法反映真实研究需求。

Method: 基于ClinGen专家标注数据构建CGBench基准，测试8种语言模型在三个关键任务上的表现：精确提取实验结果、判断证据强度、分类和描述实验结果。

Result: 模型在文献解释方面显示潜力但存在明显差距，推理模型在细粒度任务上表现更好，非推理模型在高层次解释上更优。模型常出现幻觉或误解结果。

Conclusion: CGBench揭示了语言模型在科学文献精确解释方面的优缺点，为AI在临床遗传学和科学研究中的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Variant and gene interpretation are fundamental to personalized medicine and
translational biomedicine. However, traditional approaches are manual and
labor-intensive. Generative language models (LMs) can facilitate this process,
accelerating the translation of fundamental research into clinically-actionable
insights. While existing benchmarks have attempted to quantify the capabilities
of LMs for interpreting scientific data, these studies focus on narrow tasks
that do not translate to real-world research. To meet these challenges, we
introduce CGBench, a robust benchmark that tests reasoning capabilities of LMs
on scientific publications. CGBench is built from ClinGen, a resource of
expert-curated literature interpretations in clinical genetics. CGBench
measures the ability to 1) extract relevant experimental results following
precise protocols and guidelines, 2) judge the strength of evidence, and 3)
categorize and describe the relevant outcome of experiments. We test 8
different LMs and find that while models show promise, substantial gaps exist
in literature interpretation, especially on fine-grained instructions.
Reasoning models excel in fine-grained tasks but non-reasoning models are
better at high-level interpretations. Finally, we measure LM explanations
against human explanations with an LM judge approach, revealing that models
often hallucinate or misinterpret results even when correctly classifying
evidence. CGBench reveals strengths and weaknesses of LMs for precise
interpretation of scientific publications, opening avenues for future research
in AI for clinical genetics and science more broadly.

Motivation: 在用户历史有限的情况下，个性化LLM推荐系统需要有效获取用户偏好，而生成跨领域的顺序澄清问题仍具挑战性。

Method: 采用两阶段过程：前向过程从用户档案生成澄清问题并逐步移除答案作为"噪声"；反向过程训练模型通过提问有效澄清问题来"去噪"用户档案。

Result: 该方法显著提高了LLM在提出漏斗式问题和有效获取用户偏好方面的能力。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段训练方法能够有效提升LLM生成顺序澄清问题的能力，从而更好地获取用户偏好信息。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made it possible for recommendation systems
to interact with users in open-ended conversational interfaces. In order to
personalize LLM responses, it is crucial to elicit user preferences, especially
when there is limited user history. One way to get more information is to
present clarifying questions to the user. However, generating effective
sequential clarifying questions across various domains remains a challenge. To
address this, we introduce a novel approach for training LLMs to ask sequential
questions that reveal user preferences. Our method follows a two-stage process
inspired by diffusion models. Starting from a user profile, the forward process
generates clarifying questions to obtain answers and then removes those answers
step by step, serving as a way to add ``noise'' to the user profile. The
reverse process involves training a model to ``denoise'' the user profile by
learning to ask effective clarifying questions. Our results show that our
method significantly improves the LLM's proficiency in asking funnel questions
and eliciting user preferences effectively.

Abstract: Modern manufacturing environments demand not only accurate predictions but
also interpretable insights to process anomalies, root causes, and potential
interventions. Existing AI systems often function as isolated black boxes,
lacking the seamless integration of prediction, explanation, and causal
reasoning required for a unified decision-support solution. This fragmentation
limits their trustworthiness and practical utility in high-stakes industrial
environments. In this work, we present CausalTrace, a neurosymbolic causal
analysis module integrated into the SmartPilot industrial CoPilot. CausalTrace
performs data-driven causal analysis enriched by industrial ontologies and
knowledge graphs, including advanced functions such as causal discovery,
counterfactual reasoning, and root cause analysis (RCA). It supports real-time
operator interaction and is designed to complement existing agents by offering
transparent, explainable decision support. We conducted a comprehensive
evaluation of CausalTrace using multiple causal assessment methods and the C3AN
framework (i.e. Custom, Compact, Composite AI with Neurosymbolic Integration),
which spans principles of robustness, intelligence, and trustworthiness. In an
academic rocket assembly testbed, CausalTrace achieved substantial agreement
with domain experts (ROUGE-1: 0.91 in ontology QA) and strong RCA performance
(MAP@3: 94%, PR@2: 97%, MRR: 0.92, Jaccard: 0.92). It also attained 4.59/5 in
the C3AN evaluation, demonstrating precision and reliability for live
deployment.

### [247] [Do Large Language Models Respect Contracts? Evaluating and Enforcing Contract-Adherence in Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12047)
*Soohan Lim,Joonghyuk Hahn,Hyunwoo Park,Sang-Ki Ko,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PACT是一个评估LLM生成代码合同遵循性的框架，弥补了现有基准测试只关注功能正确性而忽略合同约束的缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成基准测试（如HumanEval+、MBPP+）主要评估功能正确性，但忽略了真实软件中合同约束的重要性，无法衡量代码对异常输入的鲁棒性。

Method: PACT框架提供专注于合同违反的测试套件语料库，扩展了HumanEval+和MBPP+；通过系统分析不同提示条件下的代码生成，并引入新指标来量化合同遵循性。

Result: 分析表明，在提示中加入合同违反测试用例相比仅使用合同描述，能显著提升模型对合同的遵循能力。

Conclusion: PACT通过揭示传统基准测试忽略的关键错误，为评估LLM生成代码的功能性和合同遵循性提供了严格且可解释的指标。

Abstract: Prevailing code generation benchmarks, such as HumanEval+ and MBPP+,
primarily evaluate large language models (LLMs) with pass@k on functional
correctness using well-formed inputs. However, they ignore a crucial aspect of
real-world software: adherence to contracts-the preconditions and validity
constraints that dictate how ill-formed inputs must be rejected. This critical
oversight means that existing benchmarks fail to measure, and models
consequently fail to generate, truly robust and reliable code snippets. We
introduce PACT, a program assessment and contract-adherence evaluation
framework, to bridge this gap. PACT is the first framework designed to
systematically evaluate and enhance contract-adherence in LLM-generated code
snippets alongside functional correctness. PACT's contributions are threefold:
First, it provides a comprehensive test-suite corpus focused on contract
violations, extending HumanEval+ and MBPP+. Second, it enables a systematic
analysis of code generation under varied prompting conditions. This analysis
demonstrates that augmenting prompts with contract-violating test cases
significantly enhance a model's ability to respect contracts compared to using
contract description alone. Finally, it introduces novel metrics to rigorously
quantify contract adherence in both test generation and code generation. By
revealing critical errors that conventional benchmarks overlook, PACT provides
the rigorous and interpretable metrics to evaluate the robustness of
LLM-generated code snippets in both functionality and contract-adherence.Our
code and data are available at https://github.com/suhanmen/PACT.

TL;DR: 提出地理空间感知层(GAL)框架，将LLM智能体与结构化地球数据结合，通过整合基础设施、人口、地形和天气信息，为灾害响应提供基于证据的资源分配建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统计方法缺乏语义上下文、跨事件泛化能力差且可解释性有限，而LLM虽然具有少样本泛化能力但受限于文本且缺乏地理感知。

Method: 开发地理空间感知层(GAL)，从原始野火检测开始，自动从外部地理数据库中检索并整合基础设施、人口、地形和天气信息，生成带单位标注的感知脚本。

Result: 在真实野火场景中评估表明，地理空间接地的智能体能够超越基线方法，产生基于证据的资源分配建议。

Conclusion: 该框架能够泛化到洪水、飓风等其他灾害类型，为灾害响应提供了地理感知的LLM增强解决方案。

Abstract: Effective disaster response is essential for safeguarding lives and property.
Existing statistical approaches often lack semantic context, generalize poorly
across events, and offer limited interpretability. While Large language models
(LLMs) provide few-shot generalization, they remain text-bound and blind to
geography. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Geospatial Awareness Layer (GAL)
that grounds LLM agents in structured earth data. Starting from raw wildfire
detections, GAL automatically retrieves and integrates infrastructure,
demographic, terrain, and weather information from external geodatabases,
assembling them into a concise, unit-annotated perception script. This enriched
context enables agents to produce evidence-based resource-allocation
recommendations (e.g., personnel assignments, budget allocations), further
reinforced by historical analogs and daily change signals for incremental
updates. We evaluate the framework in real wildfire scenarios across multiple
LLM models, showing that geospatially grounded agents can outperform baselines.
The proposed framework can generalize to other hazards such as floods and
hurricanes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ThinkPilot是一个无需训练即可自动优化大型推理模型推理过程的框架，通过进化过程生成think-prefixes来指导模型获得更好的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型虽然强大，但仍存在推理效率低下和偏离目标的问题。现有的无需训练方法要么局限于僵化的启发式规则，要么只能进行描述性但不可操作的分析。

Method: 使用进化过程生成think-prefixes，这些指令基于推理行为分类学进行演化，引导模型朝着更优性能发展。

Result: 实验表明ThinkPilot能显著改善精度-长度权衡，大幅提升安全性（如将DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B的StrongREJECT分数从27.0%降至0.7），增强指令跟随能力，并能与现有基于训练的方法协同工作。

Conclusion: think-prefixes能够可靠地控制大型推理模型的推理行为，不同任务对特定行为分布有强烈偏好。通过自动识别和激发这些行为，ThinkPilot提供了一个可推广的框架来使模型推理与任务需求对齐。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are powerful, but they still suffer from
inefficient and off-target reasoning. Currently, training-free methods are
limited to either rigid heuristics or descriptive, non-actionable analyses. In
this paper, we introduce ThinkPilot, a training-free framework that
automatically optimizes LRMs reasoning. It uses an evolutionary process to
generate think-prefixes, which are instructions that evolve driven by a
taxonomy of reasoning behaviors to guide models toward superior performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate ThinkPilot's broad effectiveness: it
significantly improves the accuracy-length trade-off for efficient reasoning,
drastically improves safety (for example, cutting the StrongREJECT score of
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B from 27.0% to 0.7), and enhances instruction
following. It also synergizes with existing training-based methods. Our
analysis reveals that think-prefixes can reliably control LRMs' reasoning
behaviors, and that different tasks have strong preferences for specific
behavioral distributions. By automatically identifying and eliciting these
behaviors, ThinkPilot provides a generalizable framework for aligning LRMs
reasoning with task demands. Data and code are available at

### [250] [AI Agents as Universal Task Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12066)
*Alessandro Achille,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: AI reasoning agents are already able to solve a variety of tasks by deploying
tools, simulating outcomes of multiple hypotheses and reflecting on them. In
doing so, they perform computation, although not in the classical sense --
there is no program being executed. Still, if they perform computation, can AI
agents be universal? Can chain-of-thought reasoning solve any computable task?
How does an AI Agent learn to reason? Is it a matter of model size? Or training
dataset size?
  In this work, we reinterpret the role of learning in the context of AI
Agents, viewing them as compute-capable stochastic dynamical systems, and
highlight the role of time in a foundational principle for learning to reason.
In doing so, we propose a shift from classical inductive learning to
transductive learning -- where the objective is not to approximate the
distribution of past data, but to capture their algorithmic structure to reduce
the time needed to find solutions to new tasks.
  Transductive learning suggests that, counter to Shannon's theory, a key role
of information in learning is about reduction of time rather than
reconstruction error. In particular, we show that the optimal speed-up that a
universal solver can achieve using past data is tightly related to their
algorithmic information. Using this, we show a theoretical derivation for the
observed power-law scaling of inference time versus training time. We then show
that scaling model size can lead to behaviors that, while improving accuracy on
benchmarks, fail any reasonable test of intelligence, let alone
super-intelligence: In the limit of infinite space and time, large models can
behave as savants, able to brute-force through any task without any insight.
Instead, we argue that the key quantity to optimize when scaling reasoning
models is time, whose critical role in learning has so far only been indirectly
considered.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiCoTraj是一个基于LLM的零样本人口属性推理框架，通过层次化思维链提示从轨迹数据推断年龄、性别、收入等人口属性，无需标注训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于移动轨迹的人口属性推断方法严重依赖带标注的大规模轨迹数据，导致可解释性差且跨数据集泛化能力弱。

Method: 将轨迹转换为语义丰富的自然语言表示，包括详细活动记录和多尺度访问摘要，然后通过层次化思维链推理（事实特征提取、行为模式分析、结构化人口属性推断）指导LLM。

Result: 在真实世界轨迹数据上的实验表明，HiCoTraj在零样本场景下对多个人口属性实现了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: HiCoTraj解决了标注人口数据稀缺的挑战，同时提供了透明的推理链，实现了无需训练数据的可解释人口属性推断。

Abstract: Inferring demographic attributes such as age, sex, or income level from human
mobility patterns enables critical applications such as targeted public health
interventions, equitable urban planning, and personalized transportation
services. Existing mobility-based demographic inference studies heavily rely on
large-scale trajectory data with demographic labels, leading to limited
interpretability and poor generalizability across different datasets and user
groups. We propose HiCoTraj (Zero-Shot Demographic Reasoning via Hierarchical
Chain-of-Thought Prompting from Trajectory), a framework that leverages LLMs'
zero-shot learning and semantic understanding capabilities to perform
demographic inference without labeled training data. HiCoTraj transforms
trajectories into semantically rich, natural language representations by
creating detailed activity chronicles and multi-scale visiting summaries. Then
HiCoTraj uses a novel hierarchical chain of thought reasoning to systematically
guide LLMs through three cognitive stages: factual feature extraction,
behavioral pattern analysis, and demographic inference with structured output.
This approach addresses the scarcity challenge of labeled demographic data
while providing transparent reasoning chains. Experimental evaluation on
real-world trajectory data demonstrates that HiCoTraj achieves competitive
performance across multiple demographic attributes in zero-shot scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型仅基于语言训练，缺乏物理环境的真实体验，限制了其具身决策能力的发展。需要构建一个能够提供任务模拟、具身交互和反馈信号的训练基础设施。

Method: 开发EmboMatrix训练场，包含多智能体数据引擎生成大规模任务场景、分布式异构硬件系统实现可扩展模拟、多层次奖励架构提供精确监督。

Result: 基于EmboMatrix训练的EmboBrain-7B模型在两个具身决策基准测试中超越了671B参数的DeepSeek-R1基线9.5%。

Conclusion: 交互式、环境基础的学习方法对于构建真正智能的具身智能体具有强大潜力，EmboMatrix为LLM获得真实具身决策能力提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Embodied decision-making enables agents to translate high-level goals into
executable actions through continuous interactions within the physical world,
forming a cornerstone of general-purpose embodied intelligence. Large language
models (LLMs), with their general decision-making capabilities, offer a
promising path to realize this potential; however, LLMs trained solely on
language lack exposure to physical environments, limiting their true embodied
understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose the concept of a training ground:
a comprehensive infrastructure that provides task and scene simulation,
embodied interaction, and feedback signals, offering a one-stop solution for
LLM acquire genuine embodied decision-making skills. In this work, we present
EmboMatrix, the first training ground of its kind, providing massive and
diverse tasks with efficient simulation and precise rewards. EmboMatrix
incorporates a series of novel techniques: a multi-agent data engine for
large-scale task and scene generation, a distributed heterogeneous-hardware
system for scalable simulation, and a multi-level reward architecture for
precise supervision. Leveraging EmboMatrix, we cultivate EmboBrain, an LLM
whose embodied decision-making abilities emerge from extensive embodied
interactions. Experiments show that EmboBrain-7B surpasses the 671B DeepSeek-R1
baseline by 9.5\% on two challenging embodied decision-making benchmarks,
demonstrating the power of interactive, environment-grounded learning for
building truly intelligent embodied agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统异常检测主要关注轨迹级分析，但在大规模数据集中检测个体相对于自身历史模式的异常行为仍然是一个重大挑战。

Method: BeSTAD学习语义丰富的移动表示，整合位置意义和时间模式，采用行为聚类感知建模机制构建个性化行为档案，并通过跨时期行为比较识别异常。

Result: 该方法能够检测行为转变和常规偏离，并在大规模移动数据集中识别表现出此类变化的个体。

Conclusion: 通过直接从无标签数据学习个体行为，BeSTAD将异常检测推向个性化和可解释的移动分析。

Abstract: Traditional anomaly detection in human mobility has primarily focused on
trajectory-level analysis, identifying statistical outliers or spatiotemporal
inconsistencies across aggregated movement traces. However, detecting
individual-level anomalies, i.e., unusual deviations in a person's mobility
behavior relative to their own historical patterns, within datasets
encompassing large populations remains a significant challenge. In this paper,
we present BeSTAD (Behavior-aware Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection for Human
Mobility Data), an unsupervised framework that captures individualized
behavioral signatures across large populations and uncovers fine-grained
anomalies by jointly modeling spatial context and temporal dynamics. BeSTAD
learns semantically enriched mobility representations that integrate location
meaning and temporal patterns, enabling the detection of subtle deviations in
individual movement behavior. BeSTAD further employs a behavior-cluster-aware
modeling mechanism that builds personalized behavioral profiles from normal
activity and identifies anomalies through cross-period behavioral comparison
with consistent semantic alignment. Building on prior work in mobility behavior
clustering, this approach enables not only the detection of behavioral shifts
and deviations from established routines but also the identification of
individuals exhibiting such changes within large-scale mobility datasets. By
learning individual behaviors directly from unlabeled data, BeSTAD advances
anomaly detection toward personalized and interpretable mobility analysis.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型处理随机性任务的能力，发现虽然LLMs能产生一定随机性的输出，但表现不稳定且与预期行为存在显著偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM技术的快速发展，许多应用需要随机性（如随机决策、游戏、调度等），但LLMs处理随机性的能力尚不清楚，因此需要系统评估。

Method: 设计了一系列实验，考虑外部工具可访问性、任务类型、模型状态（新鲜vs非新鲜）和提示策略等因素，涵盖生成随机数、随机字符串、项目洗牌等任务，并使用熵和NIST随机性测试套件评估随机性质量。

Result: LLMs能够产生具有一定随机性的输出，但性能不一致，且经常显著偏离预期行为。

Conclusion: LLMs在处理涉及随机性的任务时存在关键局限性，需要在多个方面进行改进才能有效处理这类任务。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language model (LLM) technology has led to
diverse applications, many of which inherently require randomness, such as
stochastic decision-making, gaming, scheduling, AI agents, and
cryptography-related tasks. However, the capabilities of LLMs in handling
randomness, particularly in generating and utilizing random numbers
effectively, remain unclear. This paper investigates the capacity of LLMs for
handling tasks that involve randomness through a series of experiments. We
designed a set of experiments that consider various factors that can influence
an LLM's performance in tasks involving randomness, such as accessibility to
external tools, types of tasks, model states (fresh vs. non-fresh), and
prompting strategies. The experiments cover a range of tasks, including
generating random numbers, generating random strings such as passwords,
shuffling items, and evaluating the quality of randomness using entropy and the
NIST randomness test-suite. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can generate
outputs that exhibit some degree of randomness, their performance is
inconsistent and often deviates significantly from the expected behavior. The
analysis of the experimental results highlights key limitations and areas where
improvement is needed for the LLMs to effectively handle tasks involving
randomness

Conclusion: 为自主构建未知复杂环境的程序化世界模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Symbolic world modeling requires inferring and representing an environment's
transitional dynamics as an executable program. Prior work has focused on
largely deterministic environments with abundant interaction data, simple
mechanics, and human guidance. We address a more realistic and challenging
setting, learning in a complex, stochastic environment where the agent has only
"one life" to explore a hostile environment without human guidance. We
introduce OneLife, a framework that models world dynamics through
conditionally-activated programmatic laws within a probabilistic programming
framework. Each law operates through a precondition-effect structure,
activating in relevant world states. This creates a dynamic computation graph
that routes inference and optimization only through relevant laws, avoiding
scaling challenges when all laws contribute to predictions about a complex,
hierarchical state, and enabling the learning of stochastic dynamics even with
sparse rule activation. To evaluate our approach under these demanding
constraints, we introduce a new evaluation protocol that measures (a) state
ranking, the ability to distinguish plausible future states from implausible
ones, and (b) state fidelity, the ability to generate future states that
closely resemble reality. We develop and evaluate our framework on Crafter-OO,
our reimplementation of the Crafter environment that exposes a structured,
object-oriented symbolic state and a pure transition function that operates on
that state alone. OneLife can successfully learn key environment dynamics from
minimal, unguided interaction, outperforming a strong baseline on 16 out of 23
scenarios tested. We also test OneLife's planning ability, with simulated
rollouts successfully identifying superior strategies. Our work establishes a
foundation for autonomously constructing programmatic world models of unknown,
complex environments.

Abstract: We introduce ToPolyAgent, a multi-agent AI framework for performing
coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of topological polymers
through natural language instructions. By integrating large language models
(LLMs) with domain-specific computational tools, ToPolyAgent supports both
interactive and autonomous simulation workflows across diverse polymer
architectures, including linear, ring, brush, and star polymers, as well as
dendrimers. The system consists of four LLM-powered agents: a Config Agent for
generating initial polymer-solvent configurations, a Simulation Agent for
executing LAMMPS-based MD simulations and conformational analyses, a Report
Agent for compiling markdown reports, and a Workflow Agent for streamlined
autonomous operations. Interactive mode incorporates user feedback loops for
iterative refinements, while autonomous mode enables end-to-end task execution
from detailed prompts. We demonstrate ToPolyAgent's versatility through case
studies involving diverse polymer architectures under varying solvent
condition, thermostats, and simulation lengths. Furthermore, we highlight its
potential as a research assistant by directing it to investigate the effect of
interaction parameters on the linear polymer conformation, and the influence of
grafting density on the persistence length of the brush polymer. By coupling
natural language interfaces with rigorous simulation tools, ToPolyAgent lowers
barriers to complex computational workflows and advances AI-driven materials
discovery in polymer science. It lays the foundation for autonomous and
extensible multi-agent scientific research ecosystems.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了超越简单方向对齐的细粒度连续属性强度控制，并在偏好数据合成、帕累托前沿近似优化和对齐行为蒸馏三个下游任务中展示了效率提升。

Abstract: Precise attribute intensity control--generating Large Language Model (LLM)
outputs with specific, user-defined attribute intensities--is crucial for AI
systems adaptable to diverse user expectations. Current LLM alignment methods,
however, typically provide only directional or open-ended guidance, failing to
reliably achieve exact attribute intensities. We address this limitation with
three key designs: (1) reformulating precise attribute intensity control as a
target-reaching problem, rather than simple maximization; (2) training a
lightweight value function via temporal-difference learning to predict final
attribute intensity scores from partial generations, thereby steering LLM
outputs; and (3) employing gradient-based interventions on hidden
representations to navigate the model precisely towards specific attribute
intensity targets. Our method enables fine-grained, continuous control over
attribute intensities, moving beyond simple directional alignment. Experiments
on LLaMA-3.2-3b and Phi-4-mini confirm our method's ability to steer text
generation to user-specified attribute intensities with high accuracy. Finally,
we demonstrate efficiency enhancements across three downstream tasks:
preference data synthesis, Pareto frontier approximation and optimization, and
distillation of aligned behaviors for intervention-free inference. Our code is

Motivation: 填补大型语言模型在材料科学推理能力评估方面的空白，因为目前该领域的推理能力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 构建了结构化和细粒度的分类体系，包含详细的参考解决方案，支持多模态推理，并评估了不同推理策略（基础思维链、工具增强、自我纠正）的效果。

Conclusion: MatSciBench为评估和推动LLMs在材料科学领域的科学推理能力建立了全面而坚实的基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in
scientific reasoning, yet their reasoning capabilities in materials science
remain underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce MatSciBench, a
comprehensive college-level benchmark comprising 1,340 problems that span the
essential subdisciplines of materials science. MatSciBench features a
structured and fine-grained taxonomy that categorizes materials science
questions into 6 primary fields and 31 sub-fields, and includes a three-tier
difficulty classification based on the reasoning length required to solve each
question. MatSciBench provides detailed reference solutions enabling precise
error analysis and incorporates multimodal reasoning through visual contexts in
numerous questions. Evaluations of leading models reveal that even the
highest-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves under 80% accuracy on
college-level materials science questions, highlighting the complexity of
MatSciBench. Our systematic analysis of different reasoning strategie--basic
chain-of-thought, tool augmentation, and self-correction--demonstrates that no
single method consistently excels across all scenarios. We further analyze
performance by difficulty level, examine trade-offs between efficiency and
accuracy, highlight the challenges inherent in multimodal reasoning tasks,
analyze failure modes across LLMs and reasoning methods, and evaluate the
influence of retrieval-augmented generation. MatSciBench thus establishes a
comprehensive and solid benchmark for assessing and driving improvements in the
scientific reasoning capabilities of LLMs within the materials science domain.

Abstract: This review surveys the rapid evolution of Meta AI's LLaMA (Large Language
Model Meta AI) series - from LLaMA 1 through LLaMA 4 and the specialized
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods developed for these models. We
first describe the LLaMA family of foundation models (7B-65B to 288B
parameters), their architectures (including native multimodal and
Mixtureof-Experts variants), and key performance characteristics. We then
describe and discuss the concept of PEFT, which adapts large pre-trained models
by updating only a small subset of parameters, and review five PEFT methods
that have been applied to LLaMA: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), LLaMA-Adapter V1
and V2, LLaMA-Excitor, and QLoRA (Quantized LoRA). We discuss each method's
mechanism, parameter savings, and example application to LLaMA (e.g.,
instruction tuning, multimodal tasks). We provide structured discussion and
analysis of model and adapter architectures, parameter counts, and benchmark
results (including examples where fine-tuned LLaMA models outperform larger
baselines). Finally, we examine real-world use cases where LLaMA-based models
and PEFT have been successfully applied (e.g., legal and medical domains), and
we discuss ongoing challenges and future research directions (such as scaling
to even larger contexts and improving robustness). This survey paper provides a
one-stop resource for ML researchers and practitioners interested in LLaMA
models and efficient fine-tuning strategies.

*Linyi Yang,Yixuan Weng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ResearStudio是一个开源框架，通过"协作工作坊"设计实现实时人类控制的研究代理，支持AI主导、人类辅助和人类主导、AI辅助等多种模式切换，在GAIA基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度研究代理运行在"发射后不管"模式，用户无法在执行过程中修正错误或添加专家知识，需要实现实时人类控制。

Method: 采用分层规划器-执行器架构，将每个步骤写入实时"计划即文档"，通过快速通信层将每个动作、文件变更和工具调用流式传输到Web界面，用户可以随时暂停运行、编辑计划或代码、运行自定义命令并恢复。

Result: 在完全自主模式下，ResearStudio在GAIA基准测试中超越了OpenAI的DeepResearch和Manus等系统，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 强大的自动化性能和细粒度人类控制可以共存，该框架为安全可控的研究代理开发提供了支持。

Abstract: Current deep-research agents run in a ''fire-and-forget'' mode: once started,
they give users no way to fix errors or add expert knowledge during execution.
We present ResearStudio, the first open-source framework that places real-time
human control at its core. The system follows a Collaborative Workshop design.
A hierarchical Planner-Executor writes every step to a live
''plan-as-document,'' a fast communication layer streams each action, file
change, and tool call to a web interface. At any moment, the user can pause the
run, edit the plan or code, run custom commands, and resume -- switching
smoothly between AI-led, human-assisted and human-led, AI-assisted modes. In
fully autonomous mode, ResearStudio achieves state-of-the-art results on the
GAIA benchmark, surpassing systems like OpenAI's DeepResearch and Manus. These
results show that strong automated performance and fine-grained human control
can coexist. The full code, protocol, and evaluation scripts are available at
https://github.com/ResearAI/ResearStudio. We will continue to update the
repository to encourage further work on safe and controllable research agents.
Our live demo is publicly accessible at http://ai-researcher.net:3000/. We

*Aline Mangold,Juliane Zietz,Susanne Weinhold,Sebastian Pannasch*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文对65项评估可解释AI系统的用户研究进行了全面综述，提出了以人为中心的XAI系统设计目标和评估指标，并根据用户AI专业水平（AI新手和数据专家）提供差异化设计指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在日常生活中的普及，对既高性能又可理解的智能系统需求日益增长。当前XAI系统的评估过程过于技术化，未能充分关注人类用户需求，需要用户研究来指导XAI开发。

Method: 通过综述65项XAI用户研究，分析XAI系统特性和评估指标，提出以人为中心的设计目标，并根据用户AI专业水平（AI新手和数据专家）进行差异化设计。

Result: 发现XAI系统由核心系统和解释组件构成；评估指标可分为情感、认知、可用性、可解释性和解释质量；为AI新手设计目标包括负责任使用、接受度和可用性，为数据专家则侧重人机协作和任务性能。

Conclusion: 本文扩展了现有XAI评估和设计框架，提供了针对不同用户群体的差异化设计指南，有助于开发更符合人类需求的XAI系统。

Abstract: As AI becomes more common in everyday living, there is an increasing demand
for intelligent systems that are both performant and understandable.
Explainable AI (XAI) systems aim to provide comprehensible explanations of
decisions and predictions. At present, however, evaluation processes are rather
technical and not sufficiently focused on the needs of human users.
Consequently, evaluation studies involving human users can serve as a valuable
guide for conducting user studies. This paper presents a comprehensive review
of 65 user studies evaluating XAI systems across different domains and
application contexts. As a guideline for XAI developers, we provide a holistic
overview of the properties of XAI systems and evaluation metrics focused on
human users (human-centered). We propose objectives for the human-centered
design (design goals) of XAI systems. To incorporate users' specific
characteristics, design goals are adapted to users with different levels of AI
expertise (AI novices and data experts). In this regard, we provide an
extension to existing XAI evaluation and design frameworks. The first part of
our results includes the analysis of XAI system characteristics. An important
finding is the distinction between the core system and the XAI explanation,
which together form the whole system. Further results include the distinction
of evaluation metrics into affection towards the system, cognition, usability,
interpretability, and explanation metrics. Furthermore, the users, along with
their specific characteristics and behavior, can be assessed. For AI novices,
the relevant extended design goals include responsible use, acceptance, and
usability. For data experts, the focus is performance-oriented and includes
human-AI collaboration and system and user task performance.

*Hyunji Min,Sangwon Jung,Junyoung Sung,Dosung Lee,Leekyeung Han,Paul Hongsuck Seo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GOAT是一个无需人工标注的训练框架，能够从API文档自动构建合成数据集，用于微调LLM代理处理目标导向的API执行任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理在处理需要分解高级目标为多个相互依赖API调用的目标导向查询时能力有限，且缺乏训练数据。开源模型在复杂工具使用方面表现不佳。

Method: 提出GOAT训练框架，从API文档自动生成合成数据集，训练LLM代理进行目标导向的API执行，使其能够推理相互依赖的调用并生成连贯响应。

Result: GOAT训练的代理在多个现有目标导向基准测试中达到最先进性能，并在新提出的GOATBench基准测试中也表现出色。

Conclusion: GOAT为构建能够进行复杂推理和工具使用的稳健开源LLM代理提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been extended beyond traditional
text generation to serve as interactive agents capable of using external tools
based on user intent. However, current LLM agents still show limited ability to
handle goal-oriented queries, which require decomposing a high-level objective
into multiple interdependent API calls with correct planning and execution.
Current approaches mainly rely on zero-shot evaluation due to the absence of
training data. While proprietary closed-source models such as GPT-4 demonstrate
strong reasoning abilities, smaller open-source models struggle to perform
complex tool use effectively. Thus, we propose a novel training framework GOAT,
which enables fine-tuning of LLM agents in a human annotation-free setting.
GOAT automatically constructs synthetic datasets of goal-oriented API execution
tasks directly from given API documents, equipping models with the ability to
reason over interdependent calls and generate coherent responses. Through
extensive experiments, we show that GOAT-trained agents achieve
state-of-the-art performance across multiple existing goal-oriented benchmarks.
In addition, we introduce GOATBench, a new goal-oriented API execution
benchmark, and demonstrate that agents trained with GOAT also excel in this
setting. These results highlight GOAT as a practical path toward building
robust open-source LLM agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了MedKGEval框架，这是一个基于结构化医学知识的多轮临床LLM评估系统，通过知识图谱驱动患者模拟和实时评估来改进医疗对话评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法主要依赖对话转录的事后审查，忽略了医疗对话的动态性和患者信息需求的演变，无法捕捉真实临床环境中复杂的医患互动。

Method: 1) 知识图谱驱动患者模拟机制；2) 实时轮次评估框架；3) 构建包含8个先进LLM的多轮基准测试。

Result: MedKGEval能够识别传统评估流程经常忽略的细微行为缺陷和安全风险，展示了其在医疗LLM评估中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为医疗LLM提供了更可靠的评估方法，虽然最初针对中英文应用设计，但可通过切换知识图谱轻松扩展到其他语言。

Abstract: The reliable evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in medical
applications remains an open challenge, particularly in capturing the
complexity of multi-turn doctor-patient interactions that unfold in real
clinical environments. Existing evaluation methods typically rely on post hoc
review of full conversation transcripts, thereby neglecting the dynamic,
context-sensitive nature of medical dialogues and the evolving informational
needs of patients. In this work, we present MedKGEval, a novel multi-turn
evaluation framework for clinical LLMs grounded in structured medical
knowledge. Our approach introduces three key contributions: (1) a knowledge
graph-driven patient simulation mechanism, where a dedicated control module
retrieves relevant medical facts from a curated knowledge graph, thereby
endowing the patient agent with human-like and realistic conversational
behavior. This knowledge graph is constructed by integrating open-source
resources with additional triples extracted from expert-annotated datasets; (2)
an in-situ, turn-level evaluation framework, where each model response is
assessed by a Judge Agent for clinical appropriateness, factual correctness,
and safety as the dialogue progresses using a suite of fine-grained,
task-specific metrics; (3) a comprehensive multi-turn benchmark of eight
state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating MedKGEval's ability to identify subtle
behavioral flaws and safety risks that are often overlooked by conventional
evaluation pipelines. Although initially designed for Chinese and English
medical applications, our framework can be readily extended to additional
languages by switching the input knowledge graphs, ensuring seamless bilingual
support and domain-specific applicability.

*Jingyi Wang,Hongyuan Zhu,Ye Niu,Yunhui Deng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了PromptFlow框架，通过模块化设计和强化学习来优化提示工程，实现自动化的提示优化和策略选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前提示工程方法中手动设计耗时、静态更新规则无法适应不同任务需求、缺乏动态策略选择机制以及经验回收利用不足的问题。

Method: 提出PromptFlow模块化训练框架，包含元提示、操作符、优化器和评估器，采用基于梯度的元学习和强化学习来探索最优提示优化轨迹。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验证明了PromptFlow框架的有效性。

Conclusion: PromptFlow能够以最少的任务特定训练数据自主探索最优提示优化路径，为LLM的领域适应提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated profound impact on Natural
Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, their effective deployment across
diverse domains often require domain-specific adaptation strategies, as generic
models may underperform when faced with specialized data distributions. Recent
advances in prompt engineering (PE) offer a promising alternative to extensive
retraining by refining input instructions to align LLM outputs with task
objectives. This paradigm has emerged as a rapid and versatile approach for
model fine-tuning. Despite its potential, manual prompt design remains
labor-intensive and heavily depends on specialized expertise, often requiring
iterative human effort to achieve optimal formulations. To address this
limitation, automated prompt engineering methodologies have been developed to
systematically generate task-specific prompts. However, current implementations
predominantly employ static update rules and lack mechanisms for dynamic
strategy selection, resulting in suboptimal adaptation to varying NLP task
requirements. Furthermore, most methods treat and update the whole prompts at
each step, without considering editing prompt sections at a finer granularity.
At last, in particular, the problem of how to recycle experience in LLM is
still underexplored. To this end, we propose the PromptFlow, a modular training
framework inspired by TensorFlow, which integrates meta-prompts, operators,
optimization, and evaluator. Our framework can be equipped with the latest
optimization methods and autonomously explores optimal prompt refinement
trajectories through gradient-based meta-learning, requiring minimal
task-specific training data. Specifically, we devise a reinforcement learning
method to recycle experience for LLM in the PE process. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments on various datasets, and demonstrate the effectiveness of
PromptFlow.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出T³方法，通过检测和截断信念偏差过大的轨迹来改进LLM主动推理训练，提升策略优化效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在主动推理过程中容易出现信念偏差，导致问题状态跟踪失败和重复无效动作，进而影响强化学习训练效果

Method: 开发T³方法，追踪模型信念偏差，检测过度的信念偏差并在训练时截断轨迹，保留信息丰富的前缀部分

Result: 在5个挑战性任务中，T³显著提升训练稳定性、token效率和最终性能，性能提升达30%，同时减少约25%的token使用

Conclusion: 信念控制是开发鲁棒且可泛化的LLM主动推理器的关键原则

Abstract: Active reasoning requires large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external sources and strategically gather information to solve problems.
Central to this process is belief tracking: maintaining a coherent
understanding of the problem state and the missing information toward the
solution. However, due to limited reasoning capabilities, LLM-based agents
often suffer from belief deviation: they struggle to correctly model beliefs,
lose track of problem states, and fall into uninformative or repetitive
actions. Once this happens, errors compound and reinforcement learning (RL)
training fails to properly credit the crucial exploratory steps. To address
this issue, we propose to track the deviation of model beliefs and develop
$\mathbf{T^3}$, a simple yet effective method that detects excessive belief
deviation and truncates trajectories during training to remove uninformative
tails. By preserving credit for informative prefixes, $\mathbf{T^3}$
systematically improves policy optimization. Across 5 challenging tasks,
$\mathbf{T^3}$ consistently enhances training stability, token efficiency, and
final performance, achieving up to 30% gains while cutting rollout tokens by
roughly 25%. These results highlight belief control as a key principle for
developing robust and generalizable LLM-based active reasoners.

TL;DR: 提出张量逻辑语言，统一神经和符号AI，通过张量方程作为唯一构造，将逻辑规则与爱因斯坦求和统一，实现可扩展的推理和学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI工具如PyTorch、TensorFlow缺乏自动化推理和知识获取支持，而传统AI语言如LISP、Prolog缺乏可扩展性和学习支持，需要统一解决方案。

Method: 设计张量逻辑语言，以张量方程为唯一构造，将逻辑规则与爱因斯坦求和视为相同操作，并在此基础上实现各种AI形式。

Result: 成功实现了包括transformer、形式推理、核机器和图模型在内的关键神经、符号和统计AI形式，并支持嵌入空间中的可靠推理。

Conclusion: 张量逻辑结合了神经网络的可扩展性和学习能力与符号推理的可靠性和透明度，为AI的广泛应用提供了潜在基础。

Abstract: Progress in AI is hindered by the lack of a programming language with all the
requisite features. Libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow provide automatic
differentiation and efficient GPU implementation, but are additions to Python,
which was never intended for AI. Their lack of support for automated reasoning
and knowledge acquisition has led to a long and costly series of hacky attempts
to tack them on. On the other hand, AI languages like LISP an Prolog lack
scalability and support for learning. This paper proposes tensor logic, a
language that solves these problems by unifying neural and symbolic AI at a
fundamental level. The sole construct in tensor logic is the tensor equation,
based on the observation that logical rules and Einstein summation are
essentially the same operation, and all else can be reduced to them. I show how
to elegantly implement key forms of neural, symbolic and statistical AI in
tensor logic, including transformers, formal reasoning, kernel machines and
graphical models. Most importantly, tensor logic makes new directions possible,
such as sound reasoning in embedding space. This combines the scalability and
learnability of neural networks with the reliability and transparency of
symbolic reasoning, and is potentially a basis for the wider adoption of AI.

TL;DR: RAG-Anything是一个统一的多模态检索增强生成框架，能够处理文本、图像、表格和数学表达式等多种模态的内容，解决了现有RAG系统仅支持文本的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG系统与真实世界信息环境存在严重不对齐，现实知识库本质上是多模态的，包含文本、视觉元素、结构化表格和数学表达式，但现有RAG框架仅限于文本内容。

Method: 将多模态内容重新概念化为相互连接的知识实体而非孤立数据类型，引入双图构建来捕获跨模态关系和文本语义，开发了结合结构知识导航和语义匹配的跨模态混合检索方法。

Result: 在具有挑战性的多模态基准测试中表现出卓越性能，相比最先进方法有显著提升，特别是在传统方法失效的长文档上表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: RAG-Anything为多模态知识访问建立了新范式，消除了当前系统的架构碎片化限制，实现了跨所有模态的全面知识检索。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a fundamental paradigm
for expanding Large Language Models beyond their static training limitations.
However, a critical misalignment exists between current RAG capabilities and
real-world information environments. Modern knowledge repositories are
inherently multimodal, containing rich combinations of textual content, visual
elements, structured tables, and mathematical expressions. Yet existing RAG
frameworks are limited to textual content, creating fundamental gaps when
processing multimodal documents. We present RAG-Anything, a unified framework
that enables comprehensive knowledge retrieval across all modalities. Our
approach reconceptualizes multimodal content as interconnected knowledge
entities rather than isolated data types. The framework introduces dual-graph
construction to capture both cross-modal relationships and textual semantics
within a unified representation. We develop cross-modal hybrid retrieval that
combines structural knowledge navigation with semantic matching. This enables
effective reasoning over heterogeneous content where relevant evidence spans
multiple modalities. RAG-Anything demonstrates superior performance on
challenging multimodal benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over
state-of-the-art methods. Performance gains become particularly pronounced on
long documents where traditional approaches fail. Our framework establishes a
new paradigm for multimodal knowledge access, eliminating the architectural
fragmentation that constrains current systems. Our framework is open-sourced

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在数学研究中验证困难的问题，探索AI如何超越竞赛数学，成为专业数学家的研究工具。

Method: 使用LLM+CAS框架，通过符号反馈循环：LLM建议域分解，CAS对每个部分进行公理化验证，结合前沿LLM和计算机代数系统。

Result: 该框架在提出渐近不等式问题的正确域分解方面表现出色，成功回答了Terence Tao提出的问题。

Conclusion: LLM+CAS框架证明AI可以超越竞赛数学，成为专业数学家的研究级工具，特别在渐近分析领域具有重要价值。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated advanced capabilities in
solving IMO and Putnam problems; yet their role in research mathematics has
remained fairly limited. The key difficulty is verification: suggested proofs
may look plausible, but cannot be trusted without rigorous checking. We present
a framework, called LLM+CAS, and an associated tool, O-Forge, that couples
frontier LLMs with a computer algebra systems (CAS) in an In-Context Symbolic
Feedback loop to produce proofs that are both creative and symbolically
verified. Our focus is on asymptotic inequalities, a topic that often involves
difficult proofs and appropriate decomposition of the domain into the "right"
subdomains. Many mathematicians, including Terry Tao, have suggested that using
AI tools to find the right decompositions can be very useful for research-level
asymptotic analysis. In this paper, we show that our framework LLM+CAS turns
out to be remarkably effective at proposing such decompositions via a
combination of a frontier LLM and a CAS. More precisely, we use an LLM to
suggest domain decomposition, and a CAS (such as Mathematica) that provides a
verification of each piece axiomatically. Using this loop, we answer a question
posed by Terence Tao: whether LLMs coupled with a verifier can be used to help
prove intricate asymptotic inequalities. More broadly, we show how AI can move
beyond contest math towards research-level tools for professional
mathematicians.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统综述了基于大语言模型的Vibe Coding范式，通过分析1000多篇研究论文，建立了该领域的理论基础和实践框架，揭示了成功Vibe Coding依赖于系统上下文工程、完善开发环境和人机协作模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，从代码生成辅助转向自主编码代理，催生了"Vibe Coding"新开发方法。但该范式的有效性尚未充分探索，实证研究显示存在意外生产力损失和人机协作挑战。

Method: 通过系统分析1000多篇研究论文，使用约束马尔可夫决策过程形式化Vibe Coding，并综合现有实践为五种开发模型：无约束自动化、迭代对话协作、规划驱动、测试驱动和上下文增强模型。

Result: 建立了Vibe Coding的完整生态系统分析，包括编码LLM、基于LLM的编码代理、开发环境和反馈机制。成功Vibe Coding不仅依赖代理能力，更需要系统上下文工程、完善开发环境和人机协作模型。

Conclusion: Vibe Coding作为一种变革性开发方法，其成功实施需要综合考虑技术能力、开发环境和协作模式的系统化工程方法，为未来自主编码代理的发展提供了理论基础和实践指导。

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed a paradigm
shift from code generation assistance to autonomous coding agents, enabling a
novel development methodology termed "Vibe Coding" where developers validate
AI-generated implementations through outcome observation rather than
line-by-line code comprehension. Despite its transformative potential, the
effectiveness of this emergent paradigm remains under-explored, with empirical
evidence revealing unexpected productivity losses and fundamental challenges in
human-AI collaboration. To address this gap, this survey provides the first
comprehensive and systematic review of Vibe Coding with large language models,
establishing both theoretical foundations and practical frameworks for this
transformative development approach. Drawing from systematic analysis of over
1000 research papers, we survey the entire vibe coding ecosystem, examining
critical infrastructure components including LLMs for coding, LLM-based coding
agent, development environment of coding agent, and feedback mechanisms. We
first introduce Vibe Coding as a formal discipline by formalizing it through a
Constrained Markov Decision Process that captures the dynamic triadic
relationship among human developers, software projects, and coding agents.
Building upon this theoretical foundation, we then synthesize existing
practices into five distinct development models: Unconstrained Automation,
Iterative Conversational Collaboration, Planning-Driven, Test-Driven, and
Context-Enhanced Models, thus providing the first comprehensive taxonomy in
this domain. Critically, our analysis reveals that successful Vibe Coding
depends not merely on agent capabilities but on systematic context engineering,
well-established development environments, and human-agent collaborative
development models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旅游机构希望将易出错的定价任务自动化给AI系统，但未经验证的LLM部署可能导致重大财务损失和客户信任危机。

Method: 构建包含300个自然语言问题的基准测试，基于42个真实定价政策，分为基础客户类型定价和捆绑旅游折扣计算两个难度级别。

Result: 评估显示LLM在较难层级上性能急剧下降，暴露出规则解释和算术推理的系统性失败。

Conclusion: 尽管LLM具备通用能力，但在收入关键应用中仍不可靠，需要额外保障措施或领域适应。

Abstract: We present PricingLogic, the first benchmark that probes whether Large
Language Models(LLMs) can reliably automate tourism-related prices when
multiple, overlapping fare rules apply. Travel agencies are eager to offload
this error-prone task onto AI systems; however, deploying LLMs without verified
reliability could result in significant financial losses and erode customer
trust. PricingLogic comprises 300 natural-language questions based on booking
requests derived from 42 real-world pricing policies, spanning two levels of
difficulty: (i) basic customer-type pricing and (ii)bundled-tour calculations
involving interacting discounts. Evaluations of a line of LLMs reveal a steep
performance drop on the harder tier,exposing systematic failures in rule
interpretation and arithmetic reasoning.These results highlight that, despite
their general capabilities, today's LLMs remain unreliable in revenue-critical
applications without further safeguards or domain adaptation. Our code and

TL;DR: 提出了MTOS框架，结合多主题语境与LLM进行社交模拟，解决了现有研究在认知转移和跨领域语境方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实网络中信息常涉及多个相关主题，现有基于LLM的研究多关注单一主题，传统数值模型则简化了复杂语言态度，缺乏解释性和行为一致性。

Method: MTOS框架整合LLM与短期/长期记忆，采用多用户选择交互机制、动态主题选择策略和信念衰减机制，实现跨主题视角更新。

Result: 多主题设置显著改变极化趋势：正相关主题放大回音室效应，负相关主题抑制之，无关主题通过资源竞争缓解回音室。相比数值模型，LLM代理能更真实模拟动态观点变化。

Conclusion: MTOS框架能更真实地模拟动态观点变化，重现新闻文本的语言特征，捕捉复杂人类推理，提高模拟解释性和系统稳定性。

Abstract: The polarization of opinions, information segregation, and cognitive biases
on social media have attracted significant academic attention. In real-world
networks, information often spans multiple interrelated topics, posing
challenges for opinion evolution and highlighting the need for frameworks that
simulate interactions among topics. Existing studies based on large language
models (LLMs) focus largely on single topics, limiting the capture of cognitive
transfer in multi-topic, cross-domain contexts. Traditional numerical models,
meanwhile, simplify complex linguistic attitudes into discrete values, lacking
interpretability, behavioral consistency, and the ability to integrate multiple
topics. To address these issues, we propose Multi-topic Opinion Simulation
(MTOS), a social simulation framework integrating multi-topic contexts with
LLMs. MTOS leverages LLMs alongside short-term and long-term memory,
incorporates multiple user-selection interaction mechanisms and dynamic
topic-selection strategies, and employs a belief decay mechanism to enable
perspective updates across topics. We conduct extensive experiments on MTOS,
varying topic numbers, correlation types, and performing ablation studies to
assess features such as group polarization and local consistency. Results show
that multi-topic settings significantly alter polarization trends: positively
correlated topics amplify echo chambers, negatively correlated topics inhibit
them, and irrelevant topics also mitigate echo chamber effects through resource

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度强化学习的无信号交叉口决策框架，结合偏置注意力机制构建交通风险预测器，通过SAC算法实现主动安全控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无信号交叉口的自动驾驶决策面临复杂动态交互和高冲突风险的挑战，需要实现主动安全控制。

Method: 基于Soft Actor-Critic算法，使用偏置注意力机制构建交通风险预测器，将碰撞风险转化为密集奖励信号指导决策。

Result: 仿真结果表明该方法有效提高了交叉口的交通效率和车辆安全性。

Conclusion: 该智能决策框架在复杂场景中具有有效性，证明了主动安全控制的可行性。

Abstract: Autonomous driving decision-making at unsignalized intersections is highly
challenging due to complex dynamic interactions and high conflict risks. To
achieve proactive safety control, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) decision-making framework integrated with a biased attention
mechanism. The framework is built upon the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm.
Its core innovation lies in the use of biased attention to construct a traffic
risk predictor. This predictor assesses the long-term risk of collision for a
vehicle entering the intersection and transforms this risk into a dense reward
signal to guide the SAC agent in making safe and efficient driving decisions.
Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively improves both traffic efficiency and vehicle safety at the
intersection, thereby proving the effectiveness of the intelligent
decision-making framework in complex scenarios. The code of our work is
available at https://github.com/hank111525/SAC-RWB.

*Jiaxin Gao,Chen Chen,Yanwen Jia,Xueluan Gong,Kwok-Yan Lam,Qian Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了LLM作为评判者时的偏见问题，发现现有模型对偏见输入具有鲁棒性，但微调会显著降低性能，并提出四种缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在通信系统中被用于自主评估内容质量，其评判的公正性缺乏保障，任何偏见都可能影响结果并损害用户信任。

Method: 在点式评分设置下，系统调查了两种LLM评判模型（GPT-Judge和JudgeLM）的11种偏见类型，涵盖隐性和显性形式。

Result: 发现最先进的LLM评判者对偏见输入具有鲁棒性，通常给它们分配比干净样本更低的分数；提供详细评分标准能增强鲁棒性；微调会显著降低性能；评判分数与任务难度相关。

Conclusion: 提出了四种潜在的缓解策略，以确保在实际通信场景中实现公平可靠的AI评判。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to autonomously
evaluate the quality of content in communication systems, e.g., to assess
responses in telecom customer support chatbots. However, the impartiality of
these AI "judges" is not guaranteed, and any biases in their evaluation
criteria could skew outcomes and undermine user trust. In this paper, we
systematically investigate judgment biases in two LLM-as-a-judge models (i.e.,
GPT-Judge and JudgeLM) under the point-wise scoring setting, encompassing 11
types of biases that cover both implicit and explicit forms. We observed that
state-of-the-art LLM judges demonstrate robustness to biased inputs, generally
assigning them lower scores than the corresponding clean samples. Providing a
detailed scoring rubric further enhances this robustness. We further found that
fine-tuning an LLM on high-scoring yet biased responses can significantly
degrade its performance, highlighting the risk of training on biased data. We
also discovered that the judged scores correlate with task difficulty: a
challenging dataset like GPQA yields lower average scores, whereas an
open-ended reasoning dataset (e.g., JudgeLM-val) sees higher average scores.
Finally, we proposed four potential mitigation strategies to ensure fair and
reliable AI judging in practical communication scenarios.

Motivation: 解决医疗对话系统中缺乏系统化结构、无法适应临床工作流程的问题，旨在降低认知负荷并提高医疗信息收集效率。

Method: 采用有向无环图结构，包含五个核心机制：医疗算法转换、分层聚类冷启动、扩展剪枝自适应分支、终止逻辑和结构化报告生成。

Result: 患者应用：低认知负荷(15.6)、高可用性(86)、强满意度(8.1/9)；医生应用：中等认知负荷(26)、极佳可用性(88.5)、高满意度(8.3/9)。

Conclusion: 该框架有效整合到临床工作流程中，降低了认知需求并支持高效报告生成，但存在系统延迟和评估样本有限的问题。

Abstract: We developed a task-oriented dialogue framework structured as a Directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG) of medical questions. The system integrates: (1) a
systematic pipeline for transforming medical algorithms and guidelines into a
clinical question corpus; (2) a cold-start mechanism based on hierarchical
clustering to generate efficient initial questioning without prior patient
information; (3) an expand-and-prune mechanism enabling adaptive branching and
backtracking based on patient responses; (4) a termination logic to ensure
interviews end once sufficient information is gathered; and (5) automated
synthesis of doctor-friendly structured reports aligned with clinical
workflows. Human-computer interaction principles guided the design of both the
patient and physician applications. Preliminary evaluation involved five
physicians using standardized instruments: NASA-TLX (cognitive workload), the
System Usability Scale (SUS), and the Questionnaire for User Interface
Satisfaction (QUIS). The patient application achieved low workload scores
(NASA-TLX = 15.6), high usability (SUS = 86), and strong satisfaction (QUIS =
8.1/9), with particularly high ratings for ease of learning and interface
design. The physician application yielded moderate workload (NASA-TLX = 26) and
excellent usability (SUS = 88.5), with satisfaction scores of 8.3/9. Both
applications demonstrated effective integration into clinical workflows,
reducing cognitive demand and supporting efficient report generation.
Limitations included occasional system latency and a small, non-diverse
evaluation sample.

Motivation: 当前人工智能虚拟细胞（AIVCs）研究存在评估局限于单一数据集、实验室间可迁移性有限、数据分割易受泄漏和覆盖偏差影响，以及剂量、时间和组合效应未系统处理等问题。

Method: 采用模型无关的CSL视角，通过测量、提升/投影（用于跨尺度耦合）和干预（用于剂量和调度）的操作符语法组织学习过程。

Result: 提出了决策对齐的评估蓝图，强调功能空间读出（如通路活性、空间邻域和临床相关终点），并推荐操作符感知的数据设计、抗泄漏分区和透明校准报告。

Conclusion: 该框架旨在实现可重复的、同类比较，促进人工智能虚拟细胞研究的可靠发展。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence Virtual Cells (AIVCs) aim to learn executable,
decision-relevant models of cell state from multimodal, multiscale
measurements. Recent studies have introduced single-cell and spatial foundation
models, improved cross-modality alignment, scaled perturbation atlases, and
explored pathway-level readouts. Nevertheless, although held-out validation is
standard practice, evaluations remain predominantly within single datasets and
settings; evidence indicates that transport across laboratories and platforms
is often limited, that some data splits are vulnerable to leakage and coverage
bias, and that dose, time and combination effects are not yet systematically
handled. Cross-scale coupling also remains constrained, as anchors linking
molecular, cellular and tissue levels are sparse, and alignment to scientific
or clinical readouts varies across studies. We propose a model-agnostic
Cell-State Latent (CSL) perspective that organizes learning via an operator
grammar: measurement, lift/project for cross-scale coupling, and intervention
for dosing and scheduling. This view motivates a decision-aligned evaluation
blueprint across modality, scale, context and intervention, and emphasizes
function-space readouts such as pathway activity, spatial neighborhoods and
clinically relevant endpoints. We recommend operator-aware data design,
leakage-resistant partitions, and transparent calibration and reporting to
enable reproducible, like-for-like comparisons.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于原型的模型通常只在粗粒度（句子或文档级别）操作，无法处理现实世界文本分类的多标签性质，需要更细粒度的可解释模型。

Method: 采用双阶段交替训练策略：无监督原型发现阶段学习语义连贯且多样化的原型，监督分类阶段将这些原型映射到类别标签。使用分层损失函数在子句、句子和文档级别强制一致性。

Result: 在酒店评论数据集和两个公共基准测试（二分类和多分类）上的实验表明，ProtoSiTex实现了最先进的性能，同时提供忠实、与人类对齐的解释。

Conclusion: ProtoSiTex是多标签文本分类的强大半可解释解决方案，能够捕捉重叠和冲突的语义，并通过自适应原型和多头注意力增强可解释性。

Abstract: The surge in user-generated reviews has amplified the need for interpretable
models that can provide fine-grained insights. Existing prototype-based models
offer intuitive explanations but typically operate at coarse granularity
(sentence or document level) and fail to address the multi-label nature of
real-world text classification. We propose ProtoSiTex, a semi-interpretable
framework designed for fine-grained multi-label text classification. ProtoSiTex
employs a dual-phase alternating training strategy: an unsupervised prototype
discovery phase that learns semantically coherent and diverse prototypes, and a
supervised classification phase that maps these prototypes to class labels. A
hierarchical loss function enforces consistency across sub-sentence, sentence,
and document levels, enhancing interpretability and alignment. Unlike prior
approaches, ProtoSiTex captures overlapping and conflicting semantics using
adaptive prototypes and multi-head attention. We also introduce a benchmark
dataset of hotel reviews annotated at the sub-sentence level with multiple
labels. Experiments on this dataset and two public benchmarks (binary and
multi-class) show that ProtoSiTex achieves state-of-the-art performance while
delivering faithful, human-aligned explanations, establishing it as a robust
solution for semi-interpretable multi-label text classification.

Motivation: 受自然选择中竞争与合作力量驱动智力演化的启发，旨在模拟生物进化过程，超越传统的二元团队结构，实现基于基因相似度的连续合作谱系。

Method: 采用多智能体强化学习框架，为每个智能体分配基因型，基于包容性适应度设计奖励函数，允许基因共享，在囚徒困境网络游戏中研究社会动态。

Result: 实验结果与汉密尔顿法则等生物学原理一致，展示了从完全对抗到完全合作的社会动态谱系，能够产生非团队型的社会关系模式。

Conclusion: 基于包容性适应度的奖励机制为更先进战略和社会智能智能体的涌现提供了基础，可扩展至具有时空结构、有限资源和演化种群的开放环境。

Abstract: The competitive and cooperative forces of natural selection have driven the
evolution of intelligence for millions of years, culminating in nature's vast
biodiversity and the complexity of human minds. Inspired by this process, we
propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework where each agent
is assigned a genotype and where reward functions are modelled after the
concept of inclusive fitness. An agent's genetic material may be shared with
other agents, and our inclusive reward function naturally accounts for this. We
study the resulting social dynamics in two types of network games with
prisoner's dilemmas and find that our results align with well-established
principles from biology, such as Hamilton's rule. Furthermore, we outline how
this framework can extend to more open-ended environments with spatial and
temporal structure, finite resources, and evolving populations. We hypothesize
the emergence of an arms race of strategies, where each new strategy is a
gradual improvement over earlier adaptations of other agents, effectively
producing a multi-agent autocurriculum analogous to biological evolution. In
contrast to the binary team-based structures prevalent in earlier research, our
gene-based reward structure introduces a spectrum of cooperation ranging from
full adversity to full cooperativeness based on genetic similarity, enabling
unique non team-based social dynamics. For example, one agent having a mutual
cooperative relationship with two other agents, while the two other agents
behave adversarially towards each other. We argue that incorporating inclusive
fitness in agents provides a foundation for the emergence of more strategically
advanced and socially intelligent agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了HardcoreLogic基准测试，包含5000多个谜题，通过增加复杂性、非常规元素和不可解谜题三个维度来测试大型推理模型的鲁棒性，发现现有模型严重依赖记忆模式而非真正推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型在复杂任务上表现优异，但能否灵活应对非标准游戏变体仍存疑问。现有语料库主要关注标准格式谜题（如9x9数独），存在过拟合和模式记忆风险，可能掩盖模型在理解新规则或适应新变体方面的缺陷。

Method: 构建HardcoreLogic基准测试，包含10个游戏的5000多个谜题，通过三个维度系统性地转换标准谜题：增加复杂性(IC)、引入非常规元素(UE)和包含不可解谜题(UP)，以减少对捷径记忆的依赖。

Result: 评估显示，即使在现有基准测试中表现最佳的模型，在HardcoreLogic上性能也显著下降，表明它们严重依赖记忆的刻板模式。虽然增加复杂性是主要困难来源，但模型在细微规则变化上也表现不佳。

Conclusion: HardcoreLogic揭示了当前大型推理模型的局限性，为推进高水平逻辑推理建立了基准测试，表明现有模型在真正推理能力上存在明显差距。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
complex tasks, including logical puzzle games that require deriving solutions
satisfying all constraints. However, whether they can flexibly apply
appropriate rules to varying conditions, particularly when faced with
non-canonical game variants, remains an open question. Existing corpora focus
on popular puzzles like 9x9 Sudoku, risking overfitting to canonical formats
and memorization of solution patterns, which can mask deficiencies in
understanding novel rules or adapting strategies to new variants. To address
this, we introduce HardcoreLogic, a challenging benchmark of over 5,000 puzzles
across 10 games, designed to test the robustness of LRMs on the "long-tail" of
logical games. HardcoreLogic systematically transforms canonical puzzles
through three dimensions: Increased Complexity (IC), Uncommon Elements (UE),
and Unsolvable Puzzles (UP), reducing reliance on shortcut memorization.
Evaluations on a diverse set of LRMs reveal significant performance drops, even
for models achieving top scores on existing benchmarks, indicating heavy
reliance on memorized stereotypes. While increased complexity is the dominant
source of difficulty, models also struggle with subtle rule variations that do
not necessarily increase puzzle difficulty. Our systematic error analysis on
solvable and unsolvable puzzles further highlights gaps in genuine reasoning.
Overall, HardcoreLogic exposes the limitations of current LRMs and establishes
a benchmark for advancing high-level logical reasoning.

Method: 提出Memory-as-Action框架，将记忆管理作为统一策略中的显式编辑操作；开发Dynamic Context Policy Optimization算法，通过轨迹分段和轨迹级优势来解决记忆编辑导致的轨迹断裂问题。

Result: 端到端联合优化任务推理和记忆管理不仅减少了总体计算消耗，还提高了任务性能，通过适应模型内在能力的上下文管理策略实现。

Conclusion: 将记忆管理作为可学习的内部能力，通过端到端强化学习联合优化，能够有效解决LLM在长视野任务中的记忆限制问题，同时提高效率和性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models face challenges in long-horizon agentic tasks as their
constrained memory is easily overwhelmed by distracting or irrelevant context.
Existing working memory methods typically rely on external, heuristic
mechanisms that are decoupled from the agent's core policy. In this work, we
reframe working memory management as a learnable, intrinsic capability. We
propose a novel framework, Memory-as-Action, where an agent actively manages
its working memory by executing explicit editing operations as part of a
unified policy. This formulation allows an agent, trained via reinforcement
learning, to balance memory curation against long-term task objectives under
given resource constraints. However, such memory editing actions break the
standard assumption of a continuously growing prefix in LLM interactions,
leading to what we call trajectory fractures. These non-prefix changes disrupt
the causal continuity required by standard policy gradient methods, making
those methods inapplicable. To address this, we propose a new algorithm,
Dynamic Context Policy Optimization, which enables stable end-to-end
reinforcement learning by segmenting trajectories at memory action points and
applying trajectory-level advantages to the resulting action segments. Our
results demonstrate that jointly optimizing for task reasoning and memory
management in an end-to-end fashion not only reduces overall computational
consumption but also improves task performance, driven by adaptive context
curation strategies tailored to the model's intrinsic capabilities.

Conclusion: ERA为可扩展的具身智能提供了实用路径，为未来具身AI系统提供了方法论启示

Abstract: Recent advances in embodied AI highlight the potential of vision language
models (VLMs) as agents capable of perception, reasoning, and interaction in
complex environments. However, top-performing systems rely on large-scale
models that are costly to deploy, while smaller VLMs lack the necessary
knowledge and skills to succeed. To bridge this gap, we present
\textit{Embodied Reasoning Agent (ERA)}, a two-stage framework that integrates
prior knowledge learning and online reinforcement learning (RL). The first
stage, \textit{Embodied Prior Learning}, distills foundational knowledge from
three types of data: (1) Trajectory-Augmented Priors, which enrich existing
trajectory data with structured reasoning generated by stronger models; (2)
Environment-Anchored Priors, which provide in-environment knowledge and
grounding supervision; and (3) External Knowledge Priors, which transfer
general knowledge from out-of-environment datasets. In the second stage, we
develop an online RL pipeline that builds on these priors to further enhance
agent performance. To overcome the inherent challenges in agent RL, including
long horizons, sparse rewards, and training instability, we introduce three key
designs: self-summarization for context management, dense reward shaping, and
turn-level policy optimization. Extensive experiments on both high-level
planning (EB-ALFRED) and low-level control (EB-Manipulation) tasks demonstrate
that ERA-3B surpasses both prompting-based large models and previous
training-based baselines. Specifically, it achieves overall improvements of
8.4\% on EB-ALFRED and 19.4\% on EB-Manipulation over GPT-4o, and exhibits
strong generalization to unseen tasks. Overall, ERA offers a practical path
toward scalable embodied intelligence, providing methodological insights for
future embodied AI systems.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型作为评判者主要依赖简单聚合方法（如多数投票），即使个体智能体提供正确答案也可能失败，需要更有效的协作机制。

Method: 建立多智能体辩论评判框架，智能体协作推理并迭代优化回答；引入基于时间变化Beta-Binomial混合模型的稳定性检测机制，通过分布相似性（K-S检验）实现自适应停止。

Conclusion: 多智能体辩论框架能有效放大正确性，数学证明显示辩论相比静态集成方法具有优势，为自动化评判任务提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: With advancements in reasoning capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) are
increasingly employed for automated judgment tasks. While LLMs-as-Judges offer
promise in automating evaluations, current approaches often rely on simplistic
aggregation methods (e.g., majority voting), which can fail even when
individual agents provide correct answers. To address this, we propose a
multi-agent debate judge framework where agents collaboratively reason and
iteratively refine their responses. We formalize the debate process
mathematically, analyzing agent interactions and proving that debate amplifies
correctness compared to static ensembles. To enhance efficiency, we introduce a
stability detection mechanism that models judge consensus dynamics via a
time-varying Beta-Binomial mixture, with adaptive stopping based on
distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). This mechanism models the
judges' collective correct rate dynamics using a time-varying mixture of
Beta-Binomial distributions and employs an adaptive stopping criterion based on
distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic). Experiments across
multiple benchmarks and models demonstrate that our framework improves judgment
accuracy over majority voting while maintaining computational efficiency.

Result: 方法显示出有希望的结果，证明CAM数据确实可以支持车辆轨迹预测。

Conclusion: CAM数据在车辆轨迹预测方面具有潜力，但该方法仍存在一些局限性，为未来研究提供了机会。

Abstract: Autonomous driving remains a challenging task, particularly due to safety
concerns. Modern vehicles are typically equipped with expensive sensors such as
LiDAR, cameras, and radars to reduce the risk of accidents. However, these
sensors face inherent limitations: their field of view and line of sight can be
obstructed by other vehicles, thereby reducing situational awareness. In this
context, vehicle-to-vehicle communication plays a crucial role, as it enables
cars to share information and remain aware of each other even when sensors are
occluded. One way to achieve this is through the use of Cooperative Awareness
Messages (CAMs). In this paper, we investigate the use of CAM data for vehicle
trajectory prediction. Specifically, we design and train a neural network,
Cooperative Awareness Message-based Graph Neural Network (CAMNet), on a widely
used motion forecasting dataset. We then evaluate the model on a second dataset
that we created from scratch using Cooperative Awareness Messages, in order to
assess whether this type of data can be effectively exploited. Our approach
demonstrates promising results, showing that CAMs can indeed support vehicle
trajectory prediction. At the same time, we discuss several limitations of the
approach, which highlight opportunities for future research.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了AI系统的鲁棒性，特别是在OOD检测方面表现出色，且无需依赖标注数据。

Abstract: Robustness in AI systems refers to their ability to maintain reliable and
accurate performance under various conditions, including out-of-distribution
(OOD) samples, adversarial attacks, and environmental changes. This is crucial
in safety-critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles, transportation, or
healthcare, where malfunctions could have severe consequences. This paper
proposes an approach to improve OOD detection without the need of labeled data,
thereby increasing the AI systems' robustness. The proposed approach leverages
the principles of self-supervised learning, allowing the model to learn useful
representations from unlabeled data. Combined with graph-theoretical
techniques, this enables the more efficient identification and categorization
of OOD samples. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, this approach
achieved an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) =
0.99.

Motivation: 现有JavaScript模糊测试方法在突变位置选择上采用随机方式，效率不高。作者认为突变目标选择问题适合用可变臂数的组合多臂老虎机来解决。

Method: 提出CLUTCH深度组合多臂老虎机，使用注意力机制处理变长JavaScript测试用例表示，并通过Concrete Dropout动态调整探索策略。

Result: CLUTCH相比三种最先进方法，平均提高有效测试用例数量20.3%，每个测试用例覆盖率8.9%。在可变和组合设置中，后悔值分别减少至少78.1%和4.1%。

Conclusion: CLUTCH在JavaScript模糊测试中显著提高了效率，证明了深度组合多臂老虎机在突变位置选择问题上的有效性。

Abstract: JavaScript engines are widely used in web browsers, PDF readers, and
server-side applications. The rise in concern over their security has led to
the development of several targeted fuzzing techniques. However, existing
approaches use random selection to determine where to perform mutations in
JavaScript code. We postulate that the problem of selecting better mutation
targets is suitable for combinatorial bandits with a volatile number of arms.
Thus, we propose CLUTCH, a novel deep combinatorial bandit that can observe
variable length JavaScript test case representations, using an attention
mechanism from deep learning. Furthermore, using Concrete Dropout, CLUTCH can
dynamically adapt its exploration. We show that CLUTCH increases efficiency in
JavaScript fuzzing compared to three state-of-the-art solutions by increasing
the number of valid test cases and coverage-per-testcase by, respectively,
20.3% and 8.9% on average. In volatile and combinatorial settings we show that
CLUTCH outperforms state-of-the-art bandits, achieving at least 78.1% and 4.1%
less regret in volatile and combinatorial settings, respectively.

Method: 在训练时使用LLM模拟用户基于语言请求是否批准项目，训练嵌入模型来近似这些模拟判断，然后将这些基于用户请求的预测集成到传统推荐系统的信号加权中。部署时每个用户请求只需一次LLM嵌入计算。

Result: 在MovieLens数据集实验中，该方法在各种请求下都能实现细粒度控制。在19名Letterboxd用户的研究中，CTRL-Rec受到用户积极评价，与传统控制相比显著增强了用户的控制感和满意度。

Conclusion: CTRL-Rec方法成功实现了通过自然语言实时控制推荐系统，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了用户体验和控制感。

Abstract: When users are dissatisfied with recommendations from a recommender system,
they often lack fine-grained controls for changing them. Large language models
(LLMs) offer a solution by allowing users to guide their recommendations
through natural language requests (e.g., "I want to see respectful posts with a
different perspective than mine"). We propose a method, CTRL-Rec, that allows
for natural language control of traditional recommender systems in real-time
with computational efficiency. Specifically, at training time, we use an LLM to
simulate whether users would approve of items based on their language requests,
and we train embedding models that approximate such simulated judgments. We
then integrate these user-request-based predictions into the standard weighting
of signals that traditional recommender systems optimize. At deployment time,
we require only a single LLM embedding computation per user request, allowing
for real-time control of recommendations. In experiments with the MovieLens
dataset, our method consistently allows for fine-grained control across a
diversity of requests. In a study with 19 Letterboxd users, we find that
CTRL-Rec was positively received by users and significantly enhanced users'
sense of control and satisfaction with recommendations compared to traditional
controls.

TL;DR: Ax-Prover是一个基于多代理系统的自动定理证明工具，使用Lean语言，能够跨领域解决科学问题，并支持自主或与人类专家协作工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决科学问题需要创造性推理和严格的形式化验证，传统专用证明器难以泛化到不同领域。

Method: 通过Model Context Protocol将大型语言模型与Lean工具结合，LLM提供知识和推理，Lean工具确保形式正确性。

Result: 在公开数学基准测试中与最先进证明器竞争，在新引入的抽象代数和量子理论基准上显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 基于工具的代理定理证明方法为跨领域形式验证提供了可泛化的方法论，成功协助数学家形式化复杂密码学定理证明。

Abstract: We present Ax-Prover, a multi-agent system for automated theorem proving in
Lean that can solve problems across diverse scientific domains and operate
either autonomously or collaboratively with human experts. To achieve this,
Ax-Prover approaches scientific problem solving through formal proof
generation, a process that demands both creative reasoning and strict syntactic
rigor. Ax-Prover meets this challenge by equipping Large Language Models
(LLMs), which provide knowledge and reasoning, with Lean tools via the Model
Context Protocol (MCP), which ensure formal correctness. To evaluate its
performance as an autonomous prover, we benchmark our approach against frontier
LLMs and specialized prover models on two public math benchmarks and on two
Lean benchmarks we introduce in the fields of abstract algebra and quantum
theory. On public datasets, Ax-Prover is competitive with state-of-the-art
provers, while it largely outperform them on the new benchmarks. This shows
that, unlike specialized systems that struggle to generalize, our tool-based
agentic theorem prover approach offers a generalizable methodology for formal
verification across diverse scientific domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate
Ax-Prover's assistant capabilities in a practical use case, showing how it
enabled an expert mathematician to formalize the proof of a complex
cryptography theorem.

### [287] [Structure-preserving finite-element approximations of the magnetic Euler-Poisson equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11808)
*Jordan Hoffart,Matthias Maier,John N. Shadid,Ignacio Tomas*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 开发了一种保持结构的数值离散方法，用于求解带有恒定磁场的静电Euler-Poisson方程，该方法能保持密度正性、内能正性和比熵的最小原理，以及全局性质如总能量平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在磁漂移极限附近的问题，这种极限状态的特点是缓慢移动的平滑流与高频振荡共存，时间尺度差异超过10个数量级，使得数值求解极具挑战性。

Method: 采用算子分裂方法，将系统分解为两个子系统：气体动力学的可压缩Euler方程和源项系统。源项系统耦合了静电势、动量和洛伦兹力，使用隐式时间步进方案进行离散，并通过PDE Schur补方法简化为单个非对称Poisson类问题。

Result: 通过计算diocotron不稳定性验证了该方案的能力，得到的增长率与现有解析结果吻合良好。

Conclusion: 该模型虽然是Euler-Maxwell系统的简化版本，但代表了向能够在静电极限、磁漂移极限以及流体动力学区域工作的电磁求解器迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: We develop a structure-preserving numerical discretization for the
electrostatic Euler-Poisson equations with a constant magnetic field. The
scheme preserves positivity of the density, positivity of the internal energy
and a minimum principle of the specific entropy, as well as global properties,
such as total energy balance. The scheme uses an operator splitting approach
composed of two subsystems: the compressible Euler equations of gas dynamics
and a source system. The source system couples the electrostatic potential,
momentum, and Lorentz force, thus incorporating electrostatic plasma and
cyclotron motions. Because of the high-frequency phenomena it describes, the
source system is discretized with an implicit time-stepping scheme. We use a
PDE Schur complement approach for the numerical approximation of the solution
of the source system. Therefore, it reduces to a single non-symmetric
Poisson-like problem that is solved for each time step.
  Our focus with the present work is on the efficient solution of problems
close to the magnetic-drift limit. Such asymptotic limit is characterized by
the co-existence of slowly moving, smooth flows with very high-frequency
oscillations, spanning timescales that differ by over 10 orders of magnitude,
making their numerical solution quite challenging.
  We illustrate the capability of the scheme by computing a diocotron
instability and present growth rates that compare favorably with existing
analytical results. The model, though a simplified version of the
Euler-Maxwell's system, represents a stepping stone toward electromagnetic
solvers that are capable of working in the electrostatic and magnetic-drift
limits, as well as the hydrodynamic regime.

Method: 使用DFT的代数性质将二维重建问题简化为多个一维重建，开发基于动态规划和格基约化(LLL算法)的高效重建算法。

Conclusion: 提出的分治策略和格基方法有效解决了NP难子问题，实现了从有限DFT测量中高效重建整数值图像，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Exact reconstruction of an image from measurements of its Discrete Fourier
Transform (DFT) typically requires all DFT coefficients to be available.
However, incorporating the prior assumption that the image contains only
integer values enables unique recovery from a limited subset of DFT
coefficients. This paper develops both theoretical and algorithmic foundations
for this problem. We use algebraic properties of the DFT to define a reduction
from two-dimensional recovery to several well-chosen one-dimensional
recoveries. Our reduction framework characterizes the minimum number and
location of DFT coefficients that must be sampled to guarantee unique
reconstruction of an integer-valued image. Algorithmically, we develop
reconstruction procedures which use dynamic programming to efficiently recover
an integer signal or image from its minimal set of DFT measurements. While the
new inversion algorithms still involve NP-hard subproblems, we demonstrate how
the divide-and-conquer approach drastically reduces the associated search
space. To solve the NP-hard subproblems, we employ a lattice-based framework
which leverages the LLL approximation algorithm to make the algorithms fast and
practical. We provide an analysis of the lattice method, suggesting approximate
parameter choices to ensure correct inversion. Numerical results for the
algorithms support the parameter analysis and demonstrate successful recovery
of large integer images.

Abstract: We establish a deterministic and stochastic spherical quasi-interpolation
framework featuring scaled zonal kernels derived from radial basis functions on
the ambient Euclidean space. The method incorporates both quasi-Monte Carlo and
Monte Carlo quadrature rules to construct easily computable quasi-interpolants,
which provide efficient approximation to Sobolev-space functions for both clean
and noisy data. To enhance the approximation power and robustness of our
quasi-interpolants, we develop a multilevel method in which quasi-interpolants
constructed with graded resolutions join force to reduce the error of
approximation. In addition, we derive probabilistic concentration inequalities
for our quasi-interpolants in pertinent stochastic settings. The construction
of our quasi-interpolants does not require solving any linear system of
equations. Numerical experiments show that our quasi-interpolation algorithm is
more stable and robust against noise than comparable ones in the literature.

Abstract: The uncertainty quantification (UQ) for partial differential equations (PDEs)

quantifies the impact of random parameters on the solution or the

Conclusion: 所提出的全离散近似方法能够有效处理抛物型界面方程最优控制问题，克服了传统方法的收敛率限制。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate optimal control problems governed by the
parabolic interface equation, in which the control acts on the interface. The
solution to this problem exhibits low global regularity due to the jump of the
coefficient across the interface and the control acting on the interface.
Consequently, the traditional finite element method fails to achieve optimal
convergence rates when using a uniform mesh. To discretize the problem, we use
fully discrete approximations based on the stable generalized finite element
method for spatial discretization and the backward Euler scheme for temporal
discretization, as well as variational discretization for the control variable.
We prove a priori error estimates for the control, state, and adjoint state.
Numerical examples are provided to support the theoretical findings.

Conclusion: 所提出的空间两网格紧致差分格式能够有效求解二维非线性扩散波方程，具有高精度和计算效率。

Abstract: This paper presents a spatial two-grid (STG) compact difference scheme for a
two-dimensional (2D) nonlinear diffusion-wave equation with variable exponent,
which describes, e.g., the propagation of mechanical diffusive waves in
viscoelastic media with varying material properties. Following the idea of the
convolution approach, the diffusion-wave model is first transformed into an
equivalent formulation. A fully discrete scheme is then developed by applying a
compact difference approximation in space and combining the averaged product
integration rule with linear interpolation quadrature in time. An efficient
high-order two-grid algorithm is constructed by solving a small-scale nonlinear
system on the coarse grid and a large-scale linearized system on the fine grid,
where the bicubic spline interpolation operator is used to project coarse-grid
solutions to the fine grid. Under mild assumptions on the variable exponent
$\alpha(t)$, the stability and convergence of the STG compact difference scheme
are rigorously established. Numerical experiments are finally presented to
verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.

Abstract: We propose a fully mixed virtual element method for the numerical
approximation of the coupling between stress-altered diffusion and linear
elasticity equations with strong symmetry of total poroelastic stress (using
the Hellinger--Reissner principle). A novelty of this work is that we introduce
a less restrictive assumption on the stress-assisted diffusion coefficient,
requiring an analysis of the perturbed diffusion equation using Banach spaces.
The solvability of the continuous and discrete problems is established using a
suitable modification of the abstract theory for perturbed saddle-point
problems in Banach spaces (which is in itself a new result of independent
interest). In addition, we establish optimal a priori error estimates. The
method and its analysis are robust with respect to the poromechanical
parameters. We also include a number of numerical examples that illustrate the
properties of the proposed scheme.

Abstract: The blue phases are fascinating and complex states of chiral liquid crystals
which can be modeled by a comprehensive framework of the Landau-de theory,

  In this paper, we develop and analyze first and second order exponential time
differencing numerical schemes for the gradient flow of the chiral liquid
crystal blue phases, which preserve the maximum bound principle and energy
dissipation unconditionally at the semi-discrete level.
  The fully discrete schemes are obtained coupled with the Fourier spectral
method in space.
  And we propose a novel matrix-form Helmholtz basis transformation method to
diagonalize the combined operator of the Laplacian and the curl operator, which
is a key step in the implementation of the proposed schemes.
  Then by constructing auxiliary functions, we drive the $L^\infty$ boundedness
of the numerical solutions and obtain the energy dissipation and the error
estimates in $L^2$ and $L^\infty$ norm.
  Various numerical experiments are presented to validate the theoretical
results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in simulating
the dynamics of blue phases in chiral liquid crystals.

Motivation: 线性逆问题中，最优仿射重建需要精确的噪声协方差信息来加权数据保真项，但在许多实际应用中噪声统计信息未知，因此需要研究在缺乏噪声信息情况下正则化方法的表现。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在数据驱动正则化中准确建模或共同学习噪声统计信息的重要价值。

Abstract: This article addresses the challenge of learning effective regularizers for
linear inverse problems. We analyze and compare several types of learned
variational regularization against the theoretical benchmark of the optimal
affine reconstruction, i.e. the best possible affine linear map for minimizing
the mean squared error. It is known that this optimal reconstruction can be
achieved using Tikhonov regularization, but this requires precise knowledge of
the noise covariance to properly weight the data fidelity term. However, in
many practical applications, noise statistics are unknown. We therefore
investigate the performance of regularization methods learned without access to
this noise information, focusing on Tikhonov, Lavrentiev, and quadratic
regularization. Our theoretical analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate
that for non-white noise, a performance gap emerges between these methods and
the optimal affine reconstruction. Furthermore, we show that these different
types of regularization yield distinct results, highlighting that the choice of
regularizer structure is critical when the noise model is not explicitly
learned. Our findings underscore the significant value of accurately modeling
or co-learning noise statistics in data-driven regularization.

Conclusion: 通过随机KdV方程的不同噪声基数值收敛验证了2阶、3阶和4阶SETDRK、SIFRK和SRK方案的有效性，这些方法为随机微分方程的数值求解提供了便利且高效的途径。

Abstract: Convenient, easy to implement stochastic integration methods are developed on
the basis of abstract one-step deterministic order $p$ integration techniques.
The abstraction as an arbitrary one step map allows the inspection of easy to
implement stochastic exponential time differencing Runge-Kutta (SETDRK),
stochastic integrating factor Runge-Kutta (SIFRK) and stochastic RK (SRK)
schemes. Such schemes require minimal modifications to existing deterministic
schemes and converging to the Stratonovich SDE, whilst inheriting many of their
desirable properties.
  These schemes capture all symmetric terms in the Stratonovich-Taylor
expansion, are order $p$ in the limit of vanishing noise, can attain at least
strong order $p/2$ or $p/2-1/2$ (parity dependent) for drift commutative noise,
strong order $1$ for commutative noise, and strong order $1/2$ for
multidimensional non-commutative noise. Numerical convergence is demonstrated
using different bases of noise for 2nd, 3rd and 4th order SETDRK, SIFRK and SRK
schemes for a stochastic KdV equation.

Abstract: This work addresses the Galerkin isogeometric discretization of the
one-dimensional Laplace eigenvalue problem subject to homogeneous Dirichlet
boundary conditions on a bounded interval. We employ GLT theory to analyze the
behavior of the eigenfrequencies when a reparametrization is applied to the
computational domain. Under suitable assumptions on the reparametrization
transformation, we prove that a structured pattern emerges in the distribution
of eigenfrequencies when the problem is reframed through GLT-symbol analysis.
Additionally, we establish results that refine and extend those of [3],
including a uniform discrete Weyl's law. Furthermore, we derive several
eigenfrequency estimates by establishing that the symbol exhibits
asymptotically linear behavior near zero.

Conclusion: 传统绝对不稳定区域理论可能不适用于2D细长体尾流的不稳定性过渡，数值模拟中存在的非局部虚假反馈机制可能在其他强对流流动中同样存在，需要采用适当的滤波方法来获得准确结果。

Abstract: This work considers the transition to unsteadiness in the wake of 2D slender
bodies, and questions the relevance of the generally accepted scenario
involving a region of absolute instability within the near wake. The case of a
thin plate at zero incidence is first considered. Despite the absence of
absolute instability region, global stability analysis reveals the existence of
numerous unstable eigenvalues organized along a characteristic "arc-branch"
whose properties significantly depends upon the size of the numerical domain.
These arc-branch modes are explained as resulting from a non-local pressure
perturbation spuriously generated at the outlet of the domain due to the
no-stress boundary condition, which then triggers the shedding of vortical
structures at the trailing edge of the plate. The case of NACA0012 wing
profiles at small incidences is then considered. Global stability analysis
reveals that both the non-local spurious feedback mechanism and the classical
local feedback mechanism are active. Trying to suppress the spurious feedback
by enlarging the size of the numerical domain is shown to be inefficient. On
the other hand, filtering methods suppressing the exponential spatial growth of
perturbations, with either a sponge or a complex mapping, are found to be
efficient. Thanks to these ideas, the critical Reynolds number and Strouhal
number at onset can eventually be computed and are mapped for incidences in the
range $ \alpha \in [0^o - 5 ^o]$. It is postulated that the non-local feedback
mechanism evidenced here could be at play in other strongly convective flows.

Abstract: A mechanism by which the surface zonal flows of giant planets can be
gradually attenuated with depth is explored. The zonal flow is driven by an
imposed forcing in a thin layer near the surface. A meridional circulation is
set up, analogous to the Ferrel-like cells observed in Jupiter's atmosphere.
Acting on a stably stratified thin surface layer, the meridional flow induces a
horizontal temperature anomaly which leads to a gradual reduction of the zonal
winds with depth, governed by the thermal wind equation. Our model is a
Boussinesq plane layer, with gravity acting parallel to the rotation axis. A
suite of fully three-dimensional time-dependent numerical simulations has been
performed to investigate the model behaviour. Below the forced stable layer,
convection is occurring, typically in the form of tall thin cells. The
fluctuating components of the three-dimensional flow can be driven by either
the convection or the Reynolds stresses associated with the jet shear flow.
When fluctuations are mainly driven by convection in the form of tall thin
columns and the forcing is relatively weak, the horizontal temperature anomaly
persists much deeper into the interior than when it is driven by shear flow.
The zonal jets can therefore extend deep into the interior, consistent with the
Juno gravity data.

Abstract: Understanding surface-driven transport is of paramount importance from the
perspective of biological applications and the synthesis of microfluidic
devices. In this work, we develop an analysis of a local inversion symmetry
broken fluid flow model through an undulating microchannel. Surface undulations
of a few tens of Hertz in a soft microchannel keep the fluid flow in a low
Reynolds number regime, allowing the advantage of a perturbation analysis of
fluid flow. Using this, we develop a detailed analysis of the relationship
between the fluid velocity and surface undulations, which is crucial for the
subsequent numerical analysis of tracer motion. We used this information to
study the dynamics of a tracer particle in the velocity field of an undulating
microchannel. We show that the tracer particle can undergo ratcheting (which we
call the hydrodynamics ratchet effect) in very specific, physically meaningful
circumstances. We observe a ratcheting velocity of $\sim 0.15 \;\mu$m/sec for a
micrometre-sized particle at room temperature in water when the undulations
wavelength is of the order of 1 $\mu$m.

Abstract: The chemical step is an elementary pattern in chemically heterogeneous
substrates, featuring two regions of different wettability separated by a sharp
border. Within the framework of lubrication theory, we investigate droplet
motion and the contact-line dynamics driven by a chemical step, with the
contact-line singularity addressed by the Navier slip condition. For both
two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) droplets, two successive stages
are identified: the migration stage, when the droplet traverses both regions,
and the asymmetric spreading stage, when the droplet spreads on the hydrophilic
region while being constrained by the border. For 2D droplets, we present a
matched asymptotic analysis which agrees with numerical solutions. In the
migration stage, a 2D droplet can exhibit translational motion with a constant
speed. In the asymmetric spreading stage, the contact line at the droplet rear
is pinned at the border. We show that a boundary layer still exists near the
pinned contact line, across which the slope is approximately constant, whereas
the curvature would diverge in the absence of slip. For 3D droplets, our
numerical simulations show that the evolution is qualitatively analogous to the
2D case, while being significantly affected by the lateral flow. At early
times, the contact line on the hydrophilic region advances linearly and spreads
transversely according to a power law $t^{1/2}$. The droplet length and width
exhibit non-monotonic variations due to the lateral flow. Eventually, the
droplet detaches from the border and reaches equilibrium at the hydrophilic
substrate.

Abstract: The present study focuses on the gas flow through an experiment-scale modular
packed bed reactor consisting of square bars, arranged in layers. Each layer is
rotated by $30^\circ$ resulting in a complex shape of the void spaces between
the bars. Particle Image Velocimetry measurement results inside and on top of
the studied system are presented for particle-based Reynolds numbers of 100 and
200, and used as validation data for two sets of particle-resolved numerical
simulations, using boundary conforming meshing strategy and treating the solid
boundaries via the blocked-off method. The flow inside the bed is largely
independent from the Reynolds number and seems to be determined by the geometry
of the void spaces. The flow in the freeboard is dominated by the presence of
slowly dissipating jets downstream of the bed, which are characterized by
unsteady oscillations at the higher Reynolds number. The numerical results
obtained with both methods are in good agreement with the measurements, both
inside and above the bed. However, stronger deviations between the results can
be observed in the freeboard and can be traced to numerical properties of the
current simulation approaches.

Abstract: This study presents a first-principles model to predict the two-phase
pressure drop in gas-liquid intermittent flow through round capillaries, which
serve as the simplest analogous of a porous medium. Building upon the classical
capillary flow theory, we derive a model for a train of elongated bubbles, and
rigorously quantify its validity in terms of the dimensionless parameters of
the problem (capillary number, number of bubbles, gas volume fraction, and
channel length-to-diameter ratio). The total two-phase pressure drop is found
to be non-linear with respect to the mean liquid slug velocity, varying in
discrete steps due to its explicit dependence on the number of bubbles, and
also influenced by the motion of both phases. Moreover, formulating the model
in dimensionless terms reveals key scaling laws that govern the two-phase flow
rheology. Perturbation theory shows that a single bubble induces an excess
pressure drop in a liquid-filled slender channel, enabling the introduction of
a pressure-dependent effective viscosity to describe the system. Finally, our
analytical framework is extended from a single capillary to a bundle of
cylindrical tubes. In nearly homogeneous bundles, inviscid bubble trains
exhibit a smooth transition from a Bretherton-like regime with an apparent flow
exponent of 2/3 at low pressure drops to weaker sub-linear regimes (with
exponents between 2/3 and 1) as the pressure drop increases. Introducing the
smallest pores disrupts the monotonic scaling of the flow exponent, reflecting
a more complex rheological response. Deviations in two-phase flow behavior from
the Darcy law are examined across the model parameter space and in relation to
geometrical heterogeneity, offering new insights into pore-scale multiphase
transport.
