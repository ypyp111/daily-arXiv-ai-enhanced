Although pre-trained models offer a\nuseful starting point, adapting them to meet specific user needs often demands\nextensive customization, and infrastructure overhead. This challenge grows when\na single model must support diverse appli-cations with differing requirements\nfor performance. Traditional solutions often involve training multiple model\nversions to meet varying requirements, which can be inefficient and difficult\nto maintain. In order to overcome this challenge, we propose NNObfuscator, a\nnovel utility control mechanism that enables AI models to dynamically modify\ntheir performance according to predefined conditions. It is different from\ntraditional methods that need separate models for each user. Instead,\nNNObfuscator allows a single model to be adapted in real time, giving you\ncontrolled access to multiple levels of performance. This mechanism enables\nmodel owners set up tiered access, ensuring that free-tier users receive a\nbaseline level of performance while premium users benefit from enhanced\ncapabilities. The approach improves resource allocation, reduces unnecessary\ncomputation, and supports sustainable business models in AI deployment. To\nvalidate our approach, we conducted experiments on multiple tasks, including\nimage classification, semantic segmentation, and text to image generation,\nusing well-established models such as ResNet, DeepLab, VGG16, FCN and Stable\nDiffusion.

USM is composed of\ntwo Chaos Game Representations (CGR), iterated forwardly and backwardly, that\ncan be projected into the frequency domain (FCGR).

However, label errors, defined as missing labels,\nincorrect classification or inaccurate localization, often compromise the\nquality of these datasets. This can have a significant impact on the outcomes\nof training and benchmark evaluations. Although several methods now exist for\ndetecting label errors in object detection datasets, they are typically\nvalidated only on synthetic benchmarks or limited manual inspection. How to\ncorrect such errors systemically and at scale therefore remains an open\nproblem. We introduce a semi-automated framework for label-error correction\ncalled REC$\\checkmark$D (Rechecked). Building on existing detectors, the\nframework pairs their error proposals with lightweight, crowd-sourced\nmicrotasks. These tasks enable multiple annotators to independently verify each\ncandidate bounding box, and their responses are aggregated to estimate\nambiguity and improve label quality. To demonstrate the effectiveness of\nREC$\\checkmark$D, we apply it to the class pedestrian in the KITTI dataset. Our\ncrowdsourced review yields high-quality corrected annotations, which indicate a\nrate of at least 24% of missing and inaccurate annotations in original\nannotations. This validated set will be released as a new real-world benchmark\nfor label error detection and correction. We show that current label error\ndetection methods, when combined with our correction framework, can recover\nhundreds of errors in the time it would take a human to annotate bounding boxes\nfrom scratch. However, even the best methods still miss up to 66% of the true\nerrors and with low quality labels introduce more errors than they find. This\nhighlights the urgent need for further research, now enabled by our released\nbenchmark."}

There is, however, scientific consensus\nthat AI systems can reflect and exacerbate societal biases, raising concerns\nabout identity-based harm when used in critical social contexts. Prior work has\nlaid a solid foundation for assessing bias in LLMs by evaluating demographic\ndisparities in different language reasoning tasks. In this work, we extend\nsingle-axis fairness evaluations to examine intersectional bias, recognizing\nthat when multiple axes of discrimination intersect, they create distinct\npatterns of disadvantage. We create a new benchmark called WinoIdentity by\naugmenting the WinoBias dataset with 25 demographic markers across 10\nattributes, including age, nationality, and race, intersected with binary\ngender, yielding 245,700 prompts to evaluate 50 distinct bias patterns.\nFocusing on harms of omission due to underrepresentation, we investigate bias\nthrough the lens of uncertainty and propose a group (un)fairness metric called\nCoreference Confidence Disparity which measures whether models are more or less\nconfident for some intersectional identities than others. We evaluate five\nrecently published LLMs and find confidence disparities as high as 40% along\nvarious demographic attributes including body type, sexual orientation and\nsocio-economic status, with models being most uncertain about\ndoubly-disadvantaged identities in anti-stereotypical settings.

While RL\ndrives this self-improvement paradigm, a recent study (Gandhi et al., 2025)\nshows that RL alone does not truly instill these new reasoning abilities - it\nmerely draws out behaviors already present in the base models. This raises a\nquestion: How can we train the models that don't exhibit such thinking behavior\nto develop it in the first place? To this end, we propose ThinkTuning, a\nGRPO-based interactive training approach where we augment the rollouts of a\nstudent model with the guidance from a teacher model. A simple idea from\nclassroom practice inspires our method: a teacher poses a problem, lets the\nstudent try an answer, then gives corrective feedback -- enough to point the\nmind in the right direction and then show the solution. Each piece of feedback\nreshapes the student's thoughts, leading them to arrive at the correct\nsolution. Similarly, we find that this type of implicit supervision through\nfeedback from a teacher model of the same size improves the reasoning\ncapabilities of the student model.

Nonetheless, with the tool repository\nrapidly expanding, it is impractical to contain all tools within the limited\ninput length of LLMs. To alleviate these issues, researchers have explored\nincorporating a tool retrieval module to select the most relevant tools or\nrepresent tools as unique tokens within LLM parameters. However, most\nstate-of-the-art methods are under transductive settings, assuming all tools\nhave been observed during training. Such a setting deviates from reality as the\nreal-world tool repository is evolving and incorporates new tools frequently.\nWhen dealing with these unseen tools, which refer to tools not encountered\nduring the training phase, these methods are limited by two key issues,\nincluding the large distribution shift and the vulnerability of\nsimilarity-based retrieval. To this end, inspired by human cognitive processes\nof mastering unseen tools through discovering and applying the logical\ninformation from prior experience, we introduce a novel Logic-Guided Semantic\nBridging framework for inductive tool retrieval, namely, LoSemB, which aims to\nmine and transfer latent logical information for inductive tool retrieval\nwithout costly retraining.

Prior work has shown that ICL emerges in transformers due to\nthe presence of special circuits called induction heads. Given the equivalence\nbetween induction heads and conditional k-grams, a recent line of work modeling\nsequential inputs as Markov processes has revealed the fundamental impact of\nmodel depth on its ICL capabilities: while a two-layer transformer can\nefficiently represent a conditional 1-gram model, its single-layer counterpart\ncannot solve the task unless it is exponentially large. However, for higher\norder Markov sources, the best known constructions require at least three\nlayers (each with a single attention head) - leaving open the question: can a\ntwo-layer single-head transformer represent any kth-order Markov process? In\nthis paper, we precisely address this and theoretically show that a two-layer\ntransformer with one head per layer can indeed represent any conditional\nk-gram. Thus, our result provides the tightest known characterization of the\ninterplay between transformer depth and Markov order for ICL.

To solve these, we first present a novel\npseudo-mask algorithm, Fast Universal Agglomerative Pooling (UniAP). Each layer\nof UniAP can identify groups of similar nodes in parallel, allowing to generate\nboth semantic-level and instance-level and multi-granular pseudo-masks within\nens of milliseconds for one image. Based on the fast UniAP, we propose the\nScalable Self-Supervised Universal Segmentation (S2-UniSeg), which employs a\nstudent and a momentum teacher for continuous pretraining.

While prior research\nhas primarily examined their capacity for Socratic questioning, it often\noverlooks a critical dimension: adaptively guiding learners based on their\ncognitive states. This study shifts focus from mere question generation to the\nbroader instructional guidance capability. We ask: Can LLMs emulate expert\ntutors who dynamically adjust strategies in response to learners'\nunderstanding? To investigate this, we propose GuideEval, a benchmark grounded\nin authentic educational dialogues that evaluates pedagogical guidance through\na three-phase behavioral framework: (1) Perception, inferring learner states;\n(2) Orchestration, adapting instructional strategies; and (3) Elicitation,\nstimulating proper reflections. Empirical findings reveal that existing LLMs\nfrequently fail to provide effective adaptive scaffolding when learners exhibit\nconfusion or require redirection.

To overcome these challenges, DeepLight\nleverages multi-source meteorological data, including radar reflectivity, cloud\nproperties, and historical lightning occurrences through a dual-encoder\narchitecture. By employing multi-branch convolution techniques, it dynamically\ncaptures spatial correlations across varying extents. Furthermore, its novel\nHazy Loss function explicitly addresses the spatio-temporal uncertainty of\nlightning by penalizing deviations based on proximity to true events, enabling\nthe model to better learn patterns amidst randomness. Extensive experiments\nshow that DeepLight improves the Equitable Threat Score (ETS) by 18%-30% over\nstate-of-the-art methods, establishing it as a robust solution for lightning\nprediction."}

We show that\nmost detectors struggle to accurately classify texts of intermediate student\ncontribution levels, like LLM-improved human-written texts. Detectors are\nparticularly likely to produce false positives, which is problematic in\neducational settings where false suspicions can severely impact students'\nlives.

However, limited results are known if the gradient estimate has a heavy\ntail, i.e., the stochastic gradient only admits a finite $\\mathsf{p}$-th\ncentral moment for some $\\mathsf{p}\\in\\left(1,2\\right]$. Motivated by it, this\nwork examines different old algorithms for OCO (e.g., Online Gradient Descent)\nin the more challenging heavy-tailed setting. Under the standard bounded domain\nassumption, we establish new regrets for these classical methods without any\nalgorithmic modification. Remarkably, these regret bounds are fully optimal in\nall parameters (can be achieved even without knowing $\\mathsf{p}$), suggesting\nthat OCO with heavy tails can be solved effectively without any extra operation\n(e.g., gradient clipping). Our new results have several applications. A\nparticularly interesting one is the first provable convergence result for\nnonsmooth nonconvex optimization under heavy-tailed noise without gradient\nclipping.

The extensive and diverse nature of\nuser-generated information poses a significant challenge, limiting the accurate\nextraction of relevant temporal information and the effective fusion of data\nacross multiple modalities.

In this\nwork, we evaluate a collection of inference-time uncertainty measures, using\nboth established metrics and novel variations, to determine how closely they\nalign with both human group-level uncertainty and traditional notions of model\ncalibration. We find that numerous measures show evidence of strong alignment\nto human uncertainty, even despite the lack of alignment to human answer\npreference.

We construct 927K QA\npairs accompanied by explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT), enabling verifiable,\nstep-by-step spatio-temporal reasoning. We design 12 dynamic QA tasks covering\nagent motion, human-object interaction, trajectory prediction, relation\nunderstanding, and temporal-causal reasoning, with fine-grained,\nmultidimensional metrics. To tackle these tasks, we propose an end-to-end\nspatio-temporal reasoning framework that unifies dynamic and static scene\ninformation, using instance-aware feature encoding, time and camera encoding,\nand spatially adaptive down-sampling to compress large 4D scenes into token\nsequences manageable by LLMs. Experiments on EgoDynamic4D show that our method\nconsistently outperforms baselines, validating the effectiveness of multimodal\ntemporal modeling for egocentric dynamic scene understanding."}

Built on a\ndual-memory design, it enables sophisticated decision-making by ensuring\nlogical coherence through short-term action tracking and progressively\nenhancing reasoning acuity through long-term experiential learning. To support\ndiverse clinical tasks, EndoAgent integrates a suite of expert-designed tools\nwithin a unified reasoning loop. We further introduce EndoAgentBench, a\nbenchmark of 5,709 visual question-answer pairs that assess visual\nunderstanding and language generation capabilities in realistic scenarios.\nExtensive experiments show that EndoAgent consistently outperforms both general\nand medical multimodal models, exhibiting its strong flexibility and reasoning\ncapabilities."}

Caching inference responses, allowing them to be\nretrieved without another forward pass through the LLM, has emerged as one\npossible solution. Traditional exact-match caching, however, overlooks the\nsemantic similarity between queries, leading to unnecessary recomputation.\nSemantic caching addresses this by retrieving responses based on semantic\nsimilarity, but introduces a fundamentally different cache eviction problem:\none must account for mismatch costs between incoming queries and cached\nresponses. Moreover, key system parameters, such as query arrival probabilities\nand serving costs, are often unknown and must be learned over time. Existing\nsemantic caching methods are largely ad-hoc, lacking theoretical foundations\nand unable to adapt to real-world uncertainty. In this paper, we present a\nprincipled, learning-based framework for semantic cache eviction under unknown\nquery and cost distributions.

The RL paradigm requires the agent to\ninstantaneously perceive the state evolution to infer the effects of its\nactions on the environment. This is impossible if the agent receives state\nupdates over lossy or delayed wireless systems and thus operates with partial\nand intermittent information. In recent years, numerous frameworks have been\nproposed to manage RL with imperfect feedback; however, they often offer\nspecific solutions with a substantial computational burden. To address these\nlimits, we propose a novel architecture, named Homomorphic Robust Remote\nReinforcement Learning (HR3L), that enables the training of remote RL agents\nexchanging observations across a non-ideal wireless channel. HR3L considers two\nunits: the transmitter, which encodes meaningful representations of the\nenvironment, and the receiver, which decodes these messages and performs\nactions to maximize a reward signal. Importantly, HR3L does not require the\nexchange of gradient information across the wireless channel, allowing for\nquicker training and a lower communication overhead than state-of-the-art\nsolutions.

Our design is\nguided by three key ideas: (1) To compensate for the lack of forgery-relevant\nknowledge in the frozen image encoder, we inject forgery experts into each\ntransformer block to enhance its ability to capture forgery artifacts. These\nforgery experts are always activated and shared across any input images. (2) To\ndetect adversarial images, we design an light-weight adversary detector that\nlearns to capture structured, task-specific artifact in RGB domain, enabling\nreliable discrimination across various attack methods. (3) To resist\nadversarial attacks, we inject adversary experts into the global attention\nlayers and MLP modules to progressively correct feature shifts induced by\nadversarial noise. These adversary experts are adaptively activated by the\nadversary detector, thereby avoiding unnecessary interference with clean\nimages. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that\nForensicsSAM achieves superior resistance to various adversarial attack\nmethods, while also delivering state-of-the-art performance in image-level\nforgery detection and pixel-level forgery localization.

This makes it difficult to\ndistinguish genuine comprehension from correct answers derived through flawed\nreasoning or hallucinations. To address this, we introduce AURA (Audio-visual\nUnderstanding and Reasoning Assessment), a benchmark for evaluating the\ncross-modal reasoning capabilities of Audio-Visual Large Language Models\n(AV-LLMs) and Omni-modal Language Models (OLMs). AURA includes questions across\nsix challenging cognitive domains, such as causality, timbre and pitch, tempo\nand AV synchronization, unanswerability, implicit distractions, and skill\nprofiling, explicitly designed to be unanswerable from a single modality. This\nforces models to construct a valid logical path grounded in both audio and\nvideo, setting AURA apart from AV datasets that allow uni-modal shortcuts. To\nassess reasoning traces, we propose a novel metric, AuraScore, which addresses\nthe lack of robust tools for evaluating reasoning fidelity. It decomposes\nreasoning into two aspects: (i) Factual Consistency - whether reasoning is\ngrounded in perceptual evidence, and (ii) Core Inference - the logical validity\nof each reasoning step. Evaluations of SOTA models on AURA reveal a critical\nreasoning gap: although models achieve high accuracy (up to 92% on some tasks),\ntheir Factual Consistency and Core Inference scores fall below 45%. This\ndiscrepancy highlights that models often arrive at correct answers through\nflawed logic, underscoring the need for our benchmark and paving the way for\nmore robust multimodal evaluation."}

However, the security\nimplications of prompt-based aggregation in federated multimodal learning\nremain largely unexplored, leaving a critical attack surface unaddressed. In\nthis paper, we introduce \\textbf{BadPromptFL}, the first backdoor attack\ntargeting prompt-based federated learning in multimodal contrastive models. In\nBadPromptFL, compromised clients jointly optimize local backdoor triggers and\nprompt embeddings, injecting poisoned prompts into the global aggregation\nprocess. These prompts are then propagated to benign clients, enabling\nuniversal backdoor activation at inference without modifying model parameters.\nLeveraging the contextual learning behavior of CLIP-style architectures,\nBadPromptFL achieves high attack success rates (e.g., \\(>90\\%\\)) with minimal\nvisibility and limited client participation. Extensive experiments across\nmultiple datasets and aggregation protocols validate the effectiveness,\nstealth, and generalizability of our attack, raising critical concerns about\nthe robustness of prompt-based federated learning in real-world deployments."}

However, label errors, defined as missing labels,\nincorrect classification or inaccurate localization, often compromise the\nquality of these datasets. This can have a significant impact on the outcomes\nof training and benchmark evaluations. Although several methods now exist for\ndetecting label errors in object detection datasets, they are typically\nvalidated only on synthetic benchmarks or limited manual inspection. How to\ncorrect such errors systemically and at scale therefore remains an open\nproblem. We introduce a semi-automated framework for label-error correction\ncalled REC$\\checkmark$D (Rechecked). Building on existing detectors, the\nframework pairs their error proposals with lightweight, crowd-sourced\nmicrotasks. These tasks enable multiple annotators to independently verify each\ncandidate bounding box, and their responses are aggregated to estimate\nambiguity and improve label quality. To demonstrate the effectiveness of\nREC$\\checkmark$D, we apply it to the class pedestrian in the KITTI dataset. Our\ncrowdsourced review yields high-quality corrected annotations, which indicate a\nrate of at least 24% of missing and inaccurate annotations in original\nannotations. This validated set will be released as a new real-world benchmark\nfor label error detection and correction. We show that current label error\ndetection methods, when combined with our correction framework, can recover\nhundreds of errors in the time it would take a human to annotate bounding boxes\nfrom scratch. However, even the best methods still miss up to 66% of the true\nerrors and with low quality labels introduce more errors than they find. This\nhighlights the urgent need for further research, now enabled by our released\nbenchmark."}

This paper introduces MMFformer, a multimodal\ndepression detection network designed to retrieve depressive spatio-temporal\nhigh-level patterns from multimodal social media information. The transformer\nnetwork with residual connections captures spatial features from videos, and a\ntransformer encoder is exploited to design important temporal dynamics in\naudio. Moreover, the fusion architecture fused the extracted features through\nlate and intermediate fusion strategies to find out the most relevant\nintermodal correlations among them. Finally, the proposed network is assessed\non two large-scale depression detection datasets, and the results clearly\nreveal that it surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches, improving the\nF1-Score by 13.92% for D-Vlog dataset and 7.74% for LMVD dataset.

Our\napproach is built upon HuMo100M, the largest and most comprehensive human\nmotion dataset to date, comprising over 5 million self-collected motion\nsequences, 100 million multi-task instructional instances, and detailed\npart-level annotations that address a critical gap in existing datasets. We\nintroduce a novel part-aware residual quantization technique for motion\ntokenization that enables precise, granular control over individual body parts\nduring generation. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates Being-M0.5's\nsuperior performance across diverse motion benchmarks, while comprehensive\nefficiency analysis confirms its real-time capabilities. Our contributions\ninclude design insights and detailed computational analysis to guide future\ndevelopment of practical motion generators. We believe that HuMo100M and\nBeing-M0.5 represent significant advances that will accelerate the adoption of\nmotion generation technologies in real-world applications.

Weakly supervised affordance\ngrounding (WSAG) seeks to imitate human learning from third-person\ndemonstrations, where humans intuitively grasp functional parts without needing\npixel-level annotations. To achieve this, grounding is typically learned using\na shared classifier across images from different perspectives, along with\ndistillation strategies incorporating part discovery process. However, since\naffordance-relevant parts are not always easily distinguishable, models\nprimarily rely on classification, often focusing on common class-specific\npatterns that are unrelated to affordance. To address this limitation, we move\nbeyond isolated part-level learning by introducing selective prototypical and\npixel contrastive objectives that adaptively learn affordance-relevant cues at\nboth the part and object levels, depending on the granularity of the available\ninformation. Initially, we find the action-associated objects in both\negocentric (object-focused) and exocentric (third-person example) images by\nleveraging CLIP.

Furthermore, these methods typically treat ME spotting and\nrecognition as two separate tasks, overlooking the essential relationship\nbetween them.

This enables a more precise characterization of\nthe temporal dynamics of MEs and supports the modeling of MEs with varying\ndurations.
