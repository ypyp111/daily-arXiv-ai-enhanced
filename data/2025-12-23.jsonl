This enables controlled numerical studies of the mutual conversion between spin and orbital angular momentum, a central feature of relativistic spin hydrodynamics driven by the rotational viscous effect. We present two physical scenarios with a rotating fluid confined in a cylindrical container: one case in which initial orbital angular momentum is converted into spin angular momentum in analogy with the Barnett effect, and the opposite case in which initial spin angular momentum is converted into orbital angular momentum in analogy with the Einstein-de Haas effect. We investigate these conversion processes governed by the rotational viscous effect by analyzing the spacetime profiles of thermal vorticity and spin potential. Our PINNs-based framework provides the first numerical evidence for spin-orbit angular momentum conversion with fully nonlinear computational relativistic spin hydrodynamics."}

The SAO analysis servs as a verification of the computational framework against established numerical benchmarks. Crucially, the LAO simulations represent the first documented prediction across the full experimental velocity range correlated against available measured data, addressing a significant literature gap. The predictions fidelity relies on rigorous computational criteria defined through a detailed sensitivity analysis. This demonstrated numerical requirements significantly more demanding than those typically employed for computing static polars or simulating dynamic pitching motion of rigid airfoils, underscoring the severity of the aeroelastic problem. Overall, the results show strong qualitative agreement with experimental observations, successfully reproducing key dynamic stall mechanics and bifurcation phenomena.

Two-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations are conducted for a reacting, transonic, turbulent mixing layer to assess the coupling between resolved-scale and subgrid flamelet quantities, with emphasis on the role of strain rate. The FPV model is found to decouple resolved-scale and subgrid strain rates, leading to the preferential selection of equilibrium flamelet solutions in regions of high strain and resulting in nonphysical predictions of heat release and species composition. The proposed $ε$-based formulation restores physical consistency by relating the subgrid flamelet strain rate to $ε$, allowing the flamelet to respond to the local resolved-scale strain field. The inclusion of resolved-scale species transport enables advective and diffusive redistribution of products across locally quenched regions. The results indicate that $ε$ offers a physically consistent tracking variable that connects the sub-grid flamelet model to resolved-scale RANS computations."}

The formulation links resolved-scale turbulence quantities with subgrid flamelet dynamics through the local turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate, $ε$, which determines the flamelet inflow strain rate. For the first time, combustion of JP-5 is considered in a turbine stator passage as a practical fuel. This is achieved by solving transport equations for 14 major species on the resolved scale, while chemical source terms are obtained from precomputed flamelet libraries based on the HyChem A3 mechanism comprising 119 species and 841 elementary reactions. Model performance is assessed against methane combustion using both a one-step kinetics model and an $ε$-based flamelet formulation employing a 13-species skeletal mechanism. The $ε$-based formulation predicts lower peak flame temperatures due to dissociation effects and approximately 50\\% lower net chemical energy addition per unit mass compared with the one-step model, as a result of flame stand-off and downstream strain-rate-induced quenching. For JP-5, the simulations capture combined endothermic pyrolysis and exothermic oxidation processes, leading to vertically displaced reaction zones, increased near-wall temperatures, and larger resolved-scale reaction regions due to the higher flamelet flammability limit relative to methane."}

For Reasoning Multimodal Large Language Models (RMLLMs), this is uniquely challenging: intermediate chain-of-thought steps can still leak sensitive information even when final answers are forgotten, and overly aggressive interventions easily damage general reasoning ability. Yet no benchmark jointly evaluates how well unlearning methods suppress reasoning-level leakage while preserving reasoning competence. We address this gap with RMLLMU-Bench, the first benchmark for RMLLM unlearning that extends standard forgetting metrics with dedicated measures of reasoning leakage and reasoning retention. A systematic evaluation on RMLLMU-Bench reveals that existing unlearning methods for MLLMs and Large (Language) Reasoning Models (LRMs) either leave substantial leakage in the reasoning process or severely degrade reasoning performance. To address these gaps, we propose R-MUSE (Reasoning-preserving MLLM Unlearning via Subspace guidance and Adaptive Steering), a training-free and inference-time intervention framework that steers internal representations to forget both answers and reasoning traces while explicitly preserving general reasoning. Experiments on RMLLMU-Bench demonstrate that R-MUSE achieves a substantially better balance between effective forgetting and reasoning retention."}

The facility layout problem is modeled as a combinatorial assignment problem with dense logical structure arising from adjacency, separation, and slot-availability constraints. We develop a CNF-based formulation for layout feasibility and compare CDCL-based SAT solving against CP-SAT and MILP formulations under a unified benchmarking framework. Empirical results show that CDCL exhibits near-constant runtime behavior for feasibility detection across increasing problem sizes and constraint densities, while CP-SAT and MILP display polynomial and exponential scaling respectively. To address the limitation of CDCL in objective optimization, we introduce two hybrid architectures that combine CDCL-based feasibility search with CP-SAT optimization. The first architecture rapidly enumerates feasible layouts to trade optimality for speed, while the second uses CDCL to generate warm-start solutions that accelerate exact optimization. The results demonstrate that hybrid approaches can significantly reduce time-to-solution while preserving correctness guarantees, clarifying the algorithmic trade-offs between clause-learning search and exact optimization methods in large-scale discrete layout problems."}

Accurate prediction of LC mortality rates is crucial for guiding targeted interventions and addressing health disparities. Although traditional regression-based models have been commonly used, explainable machine learning models may offer enhanced predictive accuracy and deeper insights into the factors influencing LC mortality. This study applied three models: random forest (RF), gradient boosting regression (GBR), and linear regression (LR) to predict county-level LC mortality rates across the United States. Model performance was evaluated using R-squared and root mean squared error (RMSE). Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values were used to determine variable importance and their directional impact. Geographic disparities in LC mortality were analyzed through Getis-Ord (Gi*) hotspot analysis. The RF model outperformed both GBR and LR, achieving an R2 value of 41.9% and an RMSE of 12.8. SHAP analysis identified smoking rate as the most important predictor, followed by median home value and the percentage of the Hispanic ethnic population. Spatial analysis revealed significant clusters of elevated LC mortality in the mid-eastern counties of the United States. The RF model demonstrated superior predictive performance for LC mortality rates, emphasizing the critical roles of smoking prevalence, housing values, and the percentage of Hispanic ethnic population. These findings offer valuable actionable insights for designing targeted interventions, promoting screening, and addressing health disparities in regions most affected by LC in the United States."}

From a theoretical point of view, we show that the variance induced by a Poisson-Voronoi tessellation is smaller than that of the Monte Carlo method when the intensity of the underlying process is arbitrarily large and when the function to be integrated satisfies a Holder continuity condition."}

A central challenge in this setting is question answering, which requires jointly leveraging unstructured text and the structured relational signals within the graph. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant advances in natural language understanding, their direct use for reasoning over text-attributed graphs remains limited. Retrieval-augmented generation methods that operate purely on text often treat passages as isolated units, ignoring the interconnected structure of the graph. Conversely, graph-based RAG methods that serialize large subgraphs into long textual sequences quickly become infeasible due to LLM context-length constraints, resulting in fragmented reasoning and degraded accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Graph-O1, an agentic GraphRAG framework that enables LLMs to conduct stepwise, interactive reasoning over graphs. Our approach integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with end-to-end reinforcement learning, allowing the model to selectively explore and retrieve only the most informative subgraph components. The reasoning procedure is framed as a multi-turn interaction between the agent and the graph environment, and the agent is trained through a unified reward mechanism. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM backbones demonstrate that Graph-O1 consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, producing answers that are more accurate, reliable, and interpretable."}

In this work, we observe that neuron identification can be viewed as the inverse process of machine learning, which allows us to derive guarantees for neuron explanations. Based on this insight, we present the first theoretical analysis of two fundamental challenges: (1) Faithfulness: whether the identified concept faithfully represents the neuron's underlying function and (2) Stability: whether the identification results are consistent across probing datasets. We derive generalization bounds for widely used similarity metrics (e.g. accuracy, AUROC, IoU) to guarantee faithfulness, and propose a bootstrap ensemble procedure that quantifies stability along with BE (Bootstrap Explanation) method to generate concept prediction sets with guaranteed coverage probability. Experiments on both synthetic and real data validate our theoretical results and demonstrate the practicality of our method, providing an important step toward trustworthy neuron identification."}

Monotonicity constraints align model behavior with domain knowledge, but their performance cost - the price of monotonicity - is not well quantified. This paper benchmarks monotone-constrained versus unconstrained gradient boosting models for credit probability of default across five public datasets and three libraries. We define the Price of Monotonicity (PoM) as the relative change in standard performance metrics when moving from unconstrained to constrained models, estimated via paired comparisons with bootstrap uncertainty. In our experiments, PoM in AUC ranges from essentially zero to about 2.9 percent: constraints are almost costless on large datasets (typically less than 0.2 percent, often indistinguishable from zero) and most costly on smaller datasets with extensive constraint coverage (around 2-3 percent). Thus, appropriately specified monotonicity constraints can often deliver interpretability with small accuracy losses, particularly in large-scale credit portfolios."}

In standard formulations, the links with the fully compressible Navier--Stokes equations are obscured, internal energy is only implicit, and the representation of diffusion and irreversibility remains \\textit{ad hoc}. Here we derive a new Boussinesq model in a fully traceable way from the two-component compressible Navier-Stokes equations, ensuring exact energy conservation and consistent thermodynamics. Assuming a linear equation of state, our model treats density as a proxy for specific volume, distinguishes in-situ and potential temperature explicitly, and incorporates diffusive fluxes that homogenise the correct thermodynamic potentials, ensuring consistent non-negative entropy production. The result clarifies the status of gravitational potential energy, resolves ambiguities surrounding salinity--entropy coupling, and retains the small terms carriers of key information about thermodynamics. Alongside this, we introduce an exact thermodynamically soundproof (TS) model whose weak diabatic divergence highlights the role of compressibility effects in stratified turbulence. Together, these models provide a transparent framework that reconciles classical approximations with compressible energetics, offering better-defined pathways for analysing stratified mixing, mixing efficiency, and the energy budgets of geophysical flows."}

In this work, we revisit classic theory on small-world (SW) networks and ask: what changes if we treat SW connectivity as a design prior for MAS? We first bridge insights from neuroscience and complex networks to MAS, highlighting how SW structures balance local clustering and long-range integration. Using multi-agent debate (MAD) as a controlled testbed, experiment results show that SW connectivity yields nearly the same accuracy and token cost, while substantially stabilizing consensus trajectories. Building on this, we introduce an uncertainty-guided rewiring scheme for scaling MAS, where long-range shortcuts are added between epistemically divergent agents using LLM-oriented uncertainty signals (e.g., semantic entropy). This yields controllable SW structures that adapt to task difficulty and agent heterogeneity. Finally, we discuss broader implications of SW priors for MAS design, framing them as stabilizers of reasoning, enhancers of robustness, scalable coordinators, and inductive biases for emergent cognitive roles."}

However, standard concurrent-precursor large eddy simulations (LES) often neglect phenomena such as mesoscale patterns, limiting the range and controllability of inflow parameters that can be studied. Here, we propose a synthetic inflow LES method with high inflow controllability to allow parameters such as shear, turbulence, and Coriolis effects to be varied independently, facilitating the efficient exploration of wake dynamics across the full range of conditions observed in the field. The synthetic inflow method faithfully reconstructs wake dynamics when compared with standard concurrent-precursor LES. We then run a suite of over 600 LES cases to investigate the ABL processes that most affect wake dynamics. We find that wake recovery strongly depends on inflow wind veer, especially at low turbulence intensities, due to the elongation of the skewed wake. Furthermore, we identify a novel scaling relation that collapses wake deflections and dynamics onto the combination of shear and veer. The suite of LES cases elucidates ABL regimes and wake dynamics where current and future wind turbines may operate, building toward improved wake modeling for wind farm design and control."}

Despite the widespread use of data-driven methods in model development for both Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and large-eddy simulations (LES), their applications to DES remain limited. The challenge mainly lies in the absence of modelled stress data, the requirement for proper length scales in RANS and LES branches, and the maintenance of a reasonable switching behaviour. The data-driven DES method is constructed based on the algebraic stress equation. The control of RANS/LES switching is achieved through the eddy viscosity in the linear part of the modelled stress, under the $\\ell^2-ω$ DES framework. Three model coefficients associated with the pressure-strain terms and the LES length scale are represented by a neural network as functions of scalar invariants of velocity gradient. The neural network is trained using velocity data with the ensemble Kalman method, thereby circumventing the requirement for modelled stress data. Moreover, the baseline coefficient values are incorporated as additional reference data to ensure reasonable switching behaviour. The proposed approach is evaluated on two challenging turbulent flows, i.e., the secondary flow in a square duct and the separated flow over a bump. The trained model achieves significant improvements in predicting mean flow statistics compared to the baseline model. This is attributed to improved predictions of the modelled stress. The trained model also exhibits reasonable switching behaviour, enlarging the LES region to resolve more turbulent structures. Furthermore, the model shows satisfactory generalization capabilities for both cases in similar flow configurations."}

We propose an adaptation framework built upon a Masked Autoencoder backbone and evaluate its performance under a Leave-One-Dataset-Out validation protocol across five open HAR datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that both LoRA and QLoRA can match the recognition performance of full fine-tuning while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters, memory usage, and training time.

QLoRA extends these benefits by reducing the memory footprint of frozen weights through quantization, with minimal impact on classification quality."}

Supervised contrastive approaches based on the InfoNCE loss suffer from negative-sample dilution and lack adaptive decision boundaries, thereby reducing discriminative power in fine-grained recognition tasks. To address these limitations, we propose Sigmoid-based Common and Style Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCS-SupCon). Our framework introduces a sigmoid-based pairwise contrastive loss with learnable temperature and bias parameters to enable adaptive decision boundaries. This formulation emphasizes hard negatives, mitigates negative-sample dilution, and more effectively exploits supervision. In addition, an explicit style-distance constraint further disentangles style and content representations, leading to more robust feature learning. Comprehensive experiments on six benchmark datasets, including CUB200-2011 and Stanford Dogs, demonstrate that SCS-SupCon achieves state-of-the-art performance across both CNN and Transformer backbones. On CIFAR-100 with ResNet-50, SCS-SupCon improves top-1 accuracy over SupCon by approximately 3.9 percentage points and over CS-SupCon by approximately 1.7 points under five-fold cross-validation. On fine-grained datasets, it outperforms CS-SupCon by 0.4--3.0 points.

The Fredholm well-posedness of the BIEs on cornered domains is proved in weighted Sobolev spaces. We further construct an explicit density-to-Taylor mapping for the BIE and show its invertibility for all but a countable set of angles. Based on these analytical results, we propose a singularity guided Nyström (SGN) scheme for the numerical solution of BIEs on cornered domains. The SGN uses the computed corner exponents and a Legendre-tail indicator to drive panel refinement. An error analysis that combines this refinement strategy with an exponentially accurate far-field quadrature rule is provided. Numerical experiments across various cornered geometries demonstrate that SGN obtains higher order accuracy than uniform Nyström method and reveal a crowding-limited regime for domains with re-entrant angles."}

Stalagmites always remain covered by a thin water film fed by a discrete inflow of drops, which bring in new ions in solution for the stalagmites to grow. However, the gravity-induced drainage of this film and its response to the stalagmite underneath shape and the discrete drop inflow remain poorly characterised in existing growth models. To address these limitations, we develop a theoretical framework that captures the combined effects of shape curvature and discrete drop inflow on thin film drainage dynamics, starting from Reynolds lubrication theory expressed in curvilinear coordinates. From there, we show that the limiting cases of thickness-dominated and inclination-dominated drainage translate into distinct scaling laws for both the front propagation position and stationary film thickness. We further validate these results by numerically solving the governing equations. Finally, experimental measurements conducted in both cave and lab settings confirm the predicted stationary film thickness. Our findings provide insights into the influence of substrate shape and inflow dynamics on thin film drainage, with implications for stalagmite growth modelling and other gravity-driven surface flows."}

Traditional approaches for this task often struggle with the complex instance shapes and occlusions inherent in indoor environments. They frequently overshoot by attempting to predict 3D shapes directly from incomplete 2D images, which results in limited reconstruction quality. We aim to overcome this limitation by splitting the process into two steps: first, we employ diffusion-based techniques to predict the complete views of the room background and occluded indoor instances, then transform them into 3D. Our modular framework makes contributions to this field through the following components: an amodal completion module for restoring the full view of occluded instances, an inpainting model specifically trained to predict room layouts, a hybrid depth estimation technique that balances overall geometric accuracy with fine detail expressiveness, and a view-space alignment method that exploits both 2D and 3D cues to ensure precise placement of instances within the scene. This approach effectively reconstructs both foreground instances and the room background from a single image. Extensive experiments on the 3D-Front dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in terms of both visual quality and reconstruction accuracy.

Under strong explosive loading, the formation of external particle jets is primarily driven by a drag-coupled mechanism. We conducted Eulerian-Lagrangian simulations, with up to $2048^3$ effective cells and $1.8$ million tracked parcels on an adaptive mesh, for both small- and large-particle cases. Pronounced jets are observed only with small particles, alongside accelerated bed thickening. By defining characteristic inner and outer radii, the particle bed thickness evolution is quantified, showing an initial linear growth followed by a nonlinear deceleration. Particle dynamics analysis indicates that drag force dominates particle motion and jet formation during the nonlinear stage. The initial angular non-uniformity of the particle bed induces a non-uniform gas radial velocity. Through drag coupling, this flow asymmetry generates a radial velocity difference in small particles, thereby promoting pronounced jet formation, whereas large particles resist this drag-induced effect. The greater drag-induced deceleration on smaller particles leads to an increased velocity difference across the particle bed, explaining the accelerated thickening. A characteristic radius model that integrates the Gurney model for the linear stage with a drag-dominated deceleration model for the nonlinear stage is established and shows good agreement with numerical results across different particle sizes."}

Experiments on two real-world datasets, including the widely used but small open-source Foursquare NYC dataset and the large-scale Kyoto dataset collected with LY Corporation (Yahoo Japan Corporation), show that MoE-TransMov outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with notable improvements in Top-1, Top-5, Top-10 accuracy, and mean reciprocal rank (MRR). Given the results, we find that by using this approach, we can efficiently improve mobility predictions under different moving contexts, thereby enhancing the personalization of recommendation systems and advancing various urban applications."}

Tea production is a key industry for many countries. One of the main challenges in tea harvesting is tea leaf diseases. If the spread of tea leaf diseases is not stopped in time, it can lead to massive economic losses for farmers. Therefore, it is crucial to identify tea leaf diseases as soon as possible. Manually identifying tea leaf disease is an ineffective and time-consuming method, without any guarantee of success. Automating this process will improve both the efficiency and the success rate of identifying tea leaf diseases. The purpose of this study is to create an automated system that can classify different kinds of tea leaf diseases, allowing farmers to take action to minimize the damage. A novel dataset was developed specifically for this study. The dataset contains 5278 images across seven classes. The dataset was pre-processed prior to training the model. We deployed three pretrained models: DenseNet, Inception, and EfficientNet. EfficientNet was used only in the ensemble model. We utilized two different attention modules to improve model performance. The ensemble model achieved the highest accuracy of 85.68%. Explainable AI was introduced for better model interpretability."}

It consists in the exact formalism provided by the temporally filtered Navier-Stokes equations. The fundamental idea is that the smoothing action of turbulent stresses can be described as a temporal filtering operator implicitly applied to the solution. Contrary to the average and spatial filtering operators, the temporal filter is an unifying operator smoothly varying within the statistical and scale-resolving realms. The potential of the temporal filtering paradigm is here highlighted by unveiling relevant algebraic properties and by deriving a new class of turbulence closures. A dynamic procedure is derived and shown to provide an unifying closure for both scale-resolving and statistical approaches. Results show that an improved physics is captured. Challenging phenomena such as the laminar to turbulence transition and the dependence of separation and reattachment on free-stream turbulence applied through boundary conditions are captured."}

In this paper, we propose NL2CA, a novel method for auto-formalizing cognitive decision-making rules from natural language descriptions of human experience. Different from most related work that exploits either pure manual or human guided interactive modeling, our method is fully automated without any human intervention. The approach first translates text into Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) using a fine-tuned large language model (LLM), then refines the logic via an unsupervised Critic Tree, and finally transforms the output into executable production rules compatible with symbolic cognitive frameworks. Based on the resulted rules, a cognitive agent is further constructed and optimized through cognitive reinforcement learning according to the real-world behavioral data. Our method is validated in two domains: (1) NL-to-LTL translation, where our CriticNL2LTL module achieves consistent performance across both expert and large-scale benchmarks without human-in-the-loop feed-backs, and (2) cognitive driving simulation, where agents automatically constructed from human interviews have successfully learned the diverse decision patterns of about 70 trials in different critical scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that NL2CA enables scalable, interpretable, and human-aligned cognitive modeling from unstructured textual data, offering a novel paradigm to automatically design symbolic cognitive agents."}

However, strict data-sharing regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) have prevented many data-driven applications from being realised. Federated Learning (FL), in which raw data never leaves local devices, has shown promise in overcoming these limitations. Although FL has grown rapidly in recent years, it still struggles with heterogeneity, which produces gradient noise, client-drift, and increased variance from partial client participation. In this paper, we propose FedOAED, a novel federated learning algorithm designed to mitigate client-drift arising from multiple local training updates and the variance induced by partial client participation. FedOAED incorporates an on-device autoencoder denoiser on the client side to mitigate client-drift and variance resulting from heterogeneous data under limited client availability. Experiments on multiple vision datasets under Non-IID settings demonstrate that FedOAED consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines."}

Previous methods produce unlabeled decompositions or retrieve single parts without complete shape annotations. We propose ALIGN-Parts, which formulates part naming as a direct set alignment task. Our method decomposes shapes into partlets - implicit 3D part representations - matched to part descriptions via bipartite assignment. We combine geometric cues from 3D part fields, appearance from multi-view vision features, and semantic knowledge from language-model-generated affordance descriptions. Text-alignment loss ensures partlets share embedding space with text, enabling a theoretically open-vocabulary matching setup, given sufficient data. Our efficient and novel, one-shot, 3D part segmentation and naming method finds applications in several downstream tasks, including serving as a scalable annotation engine. As our model supports zero-shot matching to arbitrary descriptions and confidence-calibrated predictions for known categories, with human verification, we create a unified ontology that aligns PartNet, 3DCoMPaT++, and Find3D, consisting of 1,794 unique 3D parts. We also show examples from our newly created Tex-Parts dataset. We also introduce 2 novel metrics appropriate for the named 3D part segmentation task."}

Moreover, this method is better than standard implicit methods like the Backward Differentiation Formulae and the DC methods for the implicit midpoint rule on stiff problems for which Jacobian matrices along the solution curve have complex eigenvalues where imaginary parts have larger magnitudes than real parts. An application of DC6RK2/4 to a class of test problems for reaction-diffusion equations in one dimensional is also carried out."}

Conventional visualization of velocity or pressure fields, however, provides limited insight into the coherent mechanisms driving these dynamics. Reduced-order modeling techniques, like Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Autoencoder (AE) architectures, offer powerful alternatives to extract dominant flow features from complex datasets. This study systematically compares POD with several AE variants (Linear, Nonlinear, Convolutional, and Variational) using left ventricular flow fields obtained from computational fluid dynamics simulations. We show that, for a suitably chosen latent dimension, AEs produce modes that become nearly orthogonal and qualitatively resemble POD modes that capture a given percentage of kinetic energy. As the number of latent modes increases, AE modes progressively lose orthogonality, leading to linear dependence, spatial redundancy, and the appearance of repeated modes with substantial high-frequency content. This degradation reduces interpretability and introduces noise-like components into AE-based reduced-order models, potentially complicating their integration with physics-based formulations or neural-network surrogates. The extent of interpretability loss varies across the AEs, with nonlinear, convolutional, and variational models exhibiting distinct behaviors in orthogonality preservation and feature localization. Overall, the results indicate that AEs can reproduce POD-like coherent structures under specific latent-space configurations, while highlighting the need for careful mode selection to ensure physically meaningful representations of cardiac flow dynamics."}

The conventional approach to address this involves a two-stage pipeline: an OCR system extracts text from handwritten images, which is then translated into the target language using a machine translation model. In this work, we explore and compare the performance of traditional OCR-MT pipelines with Vision Large Language Models that aim to unify these stages and directly translate handwritten text images in a single, end-to-end step. Our motivation is grounded in the urgent need for scalable, accurate translation systems to digitize legal records such as FIRs, charge sheets, and witness statements in India's district and high courts. We evaluate both approaches on a curated dataset of handwritten Marathi legal documents, with the goal of enabling efficient legal document processing, even in low-resource environments.

However, their local evaluations make it difficult to satisfy incompressibility at the discrete level. Moreover, the collocated arrangement of velocity and pressure variables tends to induce a zero-energy mode, leading to decoupling between the two variables. In projection-based approaches, a spatial discretization scheme based on a conventional node-based moving least-squares method for the pressure causes inconsistency between the discrete operators on both sides of the Poisson equation. Thus, a solenoidal velocity field cannot be ensured numerically. In this study, a numerical method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is developed by introducing a local primal-dual grid into the mesh-constrained discrete point method, enabling consistent discrete operators. The \\textit{virtual} dual cell constructed is based on the local connectivity among nodes, and therefore our method remains truly meshfree. To achieve a consistent coupling between velocity and pressure variables under the primal-dual arrangement, time evolution converting is applied to evolve the velocity on cell interfaces. For numerical validation, a linear acoustic equation is solved to confirm the effectiveness of the staggered-variable arrangement based on the local primal-dual grid. Then, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved, and the proposed method is demonstrated to satisfy the condition of a solenoidal velocity field at the discrete level, achieve the expected spatial convergence order, and accurately reproduce flow features over a wide range of Reynolds numbers."}

Under magnetic forcing, the nanoparticles assemble into field aligned, chainlike structures, that generate a tunable magnetoelastic response, and markedly alter the extensional flow. Although behaving as Newtonian liquids in the absence of a magnetic field, the field induces extensional thickening, and the emergence of beads on a string BOAS structures in the ferrofluid filaments, a non-Newtonian signature.

To demonstrate the critical role of temporal structure in this task, we introduce Temporal Alignment Event Graph (TAEG), a graph structure that explicitly models chronology and event alignment. By applying a standard centrality algorithm to TAEG, our method functions as a version selection mechanism, choosing the most central representation of each event in its correct temporal position. In a study on the four Biblical Gospels, this structure-focused approach guarantees perfect temporal ordering (Kendall's Tau of 1.000) by design and dramatically improves content metrics (e.g., +357.2% in ROUGE-L F1). The success of this baseline method validates the formulation of Narrative Consolidation as a relevant task and establishes that an explicit temporal backbone is a fundamental component for its resolution."}

Yet, most architectures remain static and reactive, tethered to manually defined, narrow scenarios. These systems excel at perception (System 1) and deliberation (System 2) but lack a persistent meta-layer to maintain identity, verify reasoning, and align short-term actions with long-term survival. We first propose a third stratum, System 3, that presides over the agent's narrative identity and long-horizon adaptation. The framework maps selected psychological constructs to concrete computational modules, thereby translating abstract notions of artificial life into implementable design requirements. The ideas coalesce in Sophia, a \"Persistent Agent\" wrapper that grafts a continuous self-improvement loop onto any LLM-centric System 1/2 stack. Sophia is driven by four synergistic mechanisms: process-supervised thought search, narrative memory, user and self modeling, and a hybrid reward system. Together, they transform repetitive reasoning into a self-driven, autobiographical process, enabling identity continuity and transparent behavioral explanations. Although the paper is primarily conceptual, we provide a compact engineering prototype to anchor the discussion. Quantitatively, Sophia independently initiates and executes various intrinsic tasks while achieving an 80% reduction in reasoning steps for recurring operations. Notably, meta-cognitive persistence yielded a 40% gain in success for high-complexity tasks, effectively bridging the performance gap between simple and sophisticated goals. Qualitatively, System 3 exhibited a coherent narrative identity and an innate capacity for task organization. By fusing psychological insight with a lightweight reinforcement-learning core, the persistent agent architecture advances a possible practical pathway toward artificial life."}

As these systems are increasingly deployed in critical areas, ensuring their privacy and alignment with human values is paramount. Recently, selective forgetting (also known as machine unlearning) has shown promise for privacy and data removal tasks, and has emerged as a transformative paradigm shift in the field of AI. It refers to the ability of a model to selectively erase the influence of previously seen data, which is especially important for compliance with modern data protection regulations and for aligning models with human values. Despite its promise, selective forgetting raises significant privacy concerns, especially when the data involved come from sensitive domains. While new unlearning-induced privacy attacks are continuously proposed, each is shown to outperform its predecessors using different experimental settings, which can lead to overly optimistic and potentially unfair assessments that may disproportionately favor one particular attack over the others. In this work, we present the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating privacy vulnerabilities in selective forgetting. We extensively investigate privacy vulnerabilities of machine unlearning techniques and benchmark privacy leakage across a wide range of victim data, state-of-the-art unlearning privacy attacks, unlearning methods, and model architectures. We systematically evaluate and identify critical factors related to unlearning-induced privacy leakage.

Moreover, the attention module supports incremental spectral enrichment: dominant Fourier modes extracted from intermediate approximations via discrete Fourier analysis can be appended to the feature bank and used in subsequent training, without modifying the backbone architecture.\n  We further extend this framework to PDE learning by introducing a linear combination of two sub-networks: one specialized in capturing high-frequency components of the PDE solution and the other in capturing low-frequency components, with a learnable (or optimally chosen) mixing factor to balance the two contributions and improve training efficiency in oscillatory regimes. Numerical experiments on high-frequency and discontinuous regression problems, image reconstruction tasks, as well as representative PDE examples, demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method."}

We perform direct numerical simulations over a broad parameter space in incident sound pressure level (ISPL), Strouhal number (St), and Reynolds number (Re). Spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) yields energy-ranked coherent structures at each frequency, from which we construct mode-by-mode fields for spectral kinetic energy (KE) and viscous loss (VL) components to examine the mechanisms of acoustic absorption. At ISPL=150dB, the acoustic-hydrodynamic energy conversion is highest when the acoustic displacement amplitude is comparable to the slit thickness, corresponding to a Keulegan-Carpenter number of order unity. In this regime, the oscillatory boundary layer undergoes periodic separation, resulting in vortex shedding that dominates acoustic damping. VL accounts for 20-60% of the KE contribution. For higher acoustic frequencies, the confinement of the Stokes layer produces X-shaped near-slit modes, reducing the total energy input by approximately 50%. The influence of Re depends on amplitude. At ISPL=150dB, larger Re values correspond to suppressed broadband fluctuations and sharpened harmonic peaks. At ISPL = 120dB, the boundary layers remain attached, vortex shedding is weak, absorption monotonically scales with viscosity, and the Re- and St-dependencies become comparable. Across all conditions, more than 99% of the VL is confined to a compact region surrounding the slit mouth. The KE-VL spectra describe parameter regimes that enhance or suppress acoustic damping in slit geometries, providing a physically interpretable basis for acoustic-based design."}

However, current large language model (LLM)-based theorem provers suffer from limitations such as restricted domain coverage and weak generalization in mathematical reasoning. To address these issues, we propose MSC-180, a benchmark for evaluation based on the MSC2020 mathematical subject classification. It comprises 180 formal verification problems, 3 advanced problems from each of 60 mathematical branches, spanning from undergraduate to graduate levels. Each problem has undergone multiple rounds of verification and refinement by domain experts to ensure formal accuracy. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLM-based theorem provers under the pass@32 setting reveal that the best model achieves only an 18.89% overall pass rate, with prominent issues including significant domain bias (maximum domain coverage 41.7%) and a difficulty gap (significantly lower pass rates on graduate-level problems). To further quantify performance variability across mathematical domains, we introduce the coefficient of variation (CV) as an evaluation metric. The observed CV values are 4-6 times higher than the statistical high-variability threshold, indicating that the models still rely on pattern matching from training corpora rather than possessing transferable reasoning mechanisms and systematic generalization capabilities. MSC-180, together with its multi-dimensional evaluation framework, provides a discriminative and systematic benchmark for driving the development of next-generation AI systems with genuine mathematical reasoning abilities."}

Methodological paper on probabilistic user modeling and latent representation learning", "summary": "Understanding user identity and behavior is central to applications such as personalization, recommendation, and decision support. Most existing approaches rely on deterministic embeddings or black-box predictive models, offering limited uncertainty quantification and little insight into what latent representations encode. We propose a probabilistic digital twin framework in which each user is modeled as a latent stochastic state that generates observed behavioral data. The digital twin is learned via amortized variational inference, enabling scalable posterior estimation while retaining a fully probabilistic interpretation. We instantiate this framework using a variational autoencoder (VAE) applied to a user-response dataset designed to capture stable aspects of user identity. Beyond standard reconstruction-based evaluation, we introduce a statistically grounded interpretation pipeline that links latent dimensions to observable behavioral patterns. By analyzing users at the extremes of each latent dimension and validating differences using nonparametric hypothesis tests and effect sizes, we demonstrate that specific dimensions correspond to interpretable traits such as opinion strength and decisiveness. Empirically, we find that user structure is predominantly continuous rather than discretely clustered, with weak but meaningful structure emerging along a small number of dominant latent axes. These results suggest that probabilistic digital twins can provide interpretable, uncertainty-aware representations that go beyond deterministic user embeddings."}

However, detecting drones is challenging because of their small size, rapid movement, and low visual contrast. A modified architecture of YolovN called the YolovN-CBi is proposed that incorporates the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and the Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) to improve sensitivity to small object detections. A curated training dataset consisting of 28K images is created with various flying objects and a local test dataset is collected with 2500 images consisting of very small drone objects. The proposed architecture is evaluated on four benchmark datasets, along with the local test dataset. The baseline Yolov5 and the proposed Yolov5-CBi architecture outperform newer Yolo versions, including Yolov8 and Yolov12, in the speed-accuracy trade-off for small object detection. Four other variants of the proposed CBi architecture are also proposed and evaluated, which vary in the placement and usage of CBAM and BiFPN. These variants are further distilled using knowledge distillation techniques for edge deployment, using a Yolov5m-CBi teacher and a Yolov5n-CBi student. The distilled model achieved a mA@P0.5:0.9 of 0.6573, representing a 6.51% improvement over the teacher's score of 0.6171, highlighting the effectiveness of the distillation process. The distilled model is 82.9% faster than the baseline model, making it more suitable for real-time drone detection.

However, their local evaluations make it difficult to satisfy incompressibility at the discrete level. Moreover, the collocated arrangement of velocity and pressure variables tends to induce a zero-energy mode, leading to decoupling between the two variables. In projection-based approaches, a spatial discretization scheme based on a conventional node-based moving least-squares method for the pressure causes inconsistency between the discrete operators on both sides of the Poisson equation. Thus, a solenoidal velocity field cannot be ensured numerically. In this study, a numerical method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is developed by introducing a local primal-dual grid into the mesh-constrained discrete point method, enabling consistent discrete operators. The \\textit{virtual} dual cell constructed is based on the local connectivity among nodes, and therefore our method remains truly meshfree. To achieve a consistent coupling between velocity and pressure variables under the primal-dual arrangement, time evolution converting is applied to evolve the velocity on cell interfaces. For numerical validation, a linear acoustic equation is solved to confirm the effectiveness of the staggered-variable arrangement based on the local primal-dual grid. Then, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved, and the proposed method is demonstrated to satisfy the condition of a solenoidal velocity field at the discrete level, achieve the expected spatial convergence order, and accurately reproduce flow features over a wide range of Reynolds numbers."}

We present FOODER, a real-time, privacy-preserving radar-based framework that integrates OOD-based facial authentication with facial expression recognition. FOODER operates using low-cost frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar and exploits both range-Doppler and micro range-Doppler representations. The authentication module employs a multi-encoder multi-decoder architecture with Body Part (BP) and Intermediate Linear Encoder-Decoder (ILED) components to classify a single enrolled individual as in-distribution while detecting all other faces as OOD. Upon successful authentication, an expression recognition module is activated. Concatenated radar representations are processed by a ResNet block to distinguish between dynamic and static facial expressions. Based on this categorization, two specialized MobileViT networks are used to classify dynamic expressions (smile, shock) and static expressions (neutral, anger). This hierarchical design enables robust facial authentication and fine-grained expression recognition while preserving user privacy by relying exclusively on radar data. Experiments conducted on a dataset collected with a 60 GHz short-range FMCW radar demonstrate that FOODER achieves an AUROC of 94.13% and an FPR95 of 18.12% for authentication, along with an average expression recognition accuracy of 94.70%.

The formulation follows a two-fluid approach: independent diffusion equations are discretized in each phase on a fixed staggered Cartesian grid, while the phases are coupled through embedded interface conditions enforcing continuity of normal flux and a general jump law. Cut cells are treated by integrating the governing equations over phase-restricted control volumes and faces, yielding discrete divergence and gradient operators that are locally conservative within each phase. Interface coupling is achieved by introducing a small set of interfacial unknowns per cut cell on the embedded boundary; the resulting algebraic system involves only bulk and interfacial averages. A key feature of the method is the use of a reduced set of geometric information based solely on low-order moments (trimmed volumes, apertures and interface measures/centroids), allowing robust implementation without constructing explicitly cut-cell polytopes. The method supports steady (Poisson) and unsteady (diffusion) regimes and incorporates Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin boundary conditions and general jumps. We validate the scheme on one-, two- and three-dimensional mono- and diphasic benchmarks, including curved embedded boundaries, Robin conditions and strong property/jump contrasts. The results demonstrate the expected convergence behavior, sharp enforcement of interfacial laws and excellent conservation properties. Extensions to moving interfaces and Stefan-type free-boundary problems are natural perspectives of this framework."}

Monitoring the chain-of-thought (CoT) of today's reasoning models has proven effective for detecting misbehavior. However, this \"monitorability\" may be fragile under different training procedures, data sources, or even continued system scaling. To measure and track monitorability, we propose three evaluation archetypes (intervention, process, and outcome-property) and a new monitorability metric, and introduce a broad evaluation suite. We demonstrate that these evaluations can catch simple model organisms trained to have obfuscated CoTs, and that CoT monitoring is more effective than action-only monitoring in practical settings. We compare the monitorability of various frontier models and find that most models are fairly, but not perfectly, monitorable. We also evaluate how monitorability scales with inference-time compute, reinforcement learning optimization, and pre-training model size. We find that longer CoTs are generally more monitorable and that RL optimization does not materially decrease monitorability even at the current frontier scale. Notably, we find that for a model at a low reasoning effort, we could instead deploy a smaller model at a higher reasoning effort (thereby matching capabilities) and obtain a higher monitorability, albeit at a higher overall inference compute cost. We further investigate agent-monitor scaling trends and find that scaling a weak monitor's test-time compute when monitoring a strong agent increases monitorability. Giving the weak monitor access to CoT not only improves monitorability, but it steepens the monitor's test-time compute to monitorability scaling trend. Finally, we show we can improve monitorability by asking models follow-up questions and giving their follow-up CoT to the monitor."}

The core idea is to make structure the carrier of explanations: an image is encoded as an attributed graph (critical points and lines represented as nodes with geometric attributes), and generalization is achieved via the formation of concept attractors (class-level concept graphs). Purpose. To design and experimentally validate an architecture in which class concepts are formed from a handful of examples (5 - 6 per class) through structural and parametric reductions, providing transparent decisions and eliminating backpropagation. Methods. Contour vectorization is followed by constructing a bipartite graph (Point/Line as nodes) with normalized geometric attributes such as coordinates, length, angle, and direction; reductions include the elimination of unstable substructures or noise and the alignment of paths between critical points. Concepts are formed by iterative composition of samples, and classification is performed by selecting the best graph-to-concept match (using approximated GED). Results. On an MNIST subset with 5 - 6 base examples per class (single epoch), we obtain a consistent accuracy of around 82% with full traceability of decisions: misclassifications can be explained by explicit structural similarities.

Recent deep learning-based models have reduced various modeling assumptions including proportional hazard and linearity. However, a persistent challenge remains in incorporating longitudinal covariates, with prior work largely focusing on cross-sectional features, and in assessing calibration of these models, with research primarily focusing on discrimination during evaluation. We introduce TraCeR, a transformer-based survival analysis framework for incorporating longitudinal covariates. Based on a factorized self-attention architecture, TraCeR estimates the hazard function from a sequence of measurements, naturally capturing temporal covariate interactions without assumptions about the underlying data-generating process. The framework is inherently designed to handle censored data and competing events. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that TraCeR achieves substantial and statistically significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our evaluation extends beyond discrimination metrics and assesses model calibration, addressing a key oversight in literature."}

To handle testing domains, domain adaptation (DA) is trained to adapt to a fixed and observed testing domain; a more challenging paradigm, test-time adaptation (TTA), cannot access the testing domain during training and online adapts to the testing samples during testing, where the samples are from a fixed domain. We aim to explore a more practical and underexplored scenario, continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) for text understanding, which involves a sequence of testing (unobserved) domains in testing. Current CTTA methods struggle in reducing error accumulation over domains and enhancing generalization to handle unobserved domains: 1) Noise-filtering reduces accumulated errors but discards useful information, and 2) accumulating historical domains enhances generalization, but it is hard to achieve adaptive accumulation. In this paper, we propose a CTTA-T (continual test-time adaptation for text understanding) framework adaptable to evolving target domains: it adopts a teacher-student framework, where the teacher is domain-aware and generalized for evolving domains. To improve teacher predictions, we propose a refine-then-filter based on dropout-driven consistency, which calibrates predictions and removes unreliable guidance. For the adaptation-generalization trade-off, we construct a domain-aware teacher by dynamically accumulating cross-domain semantics via incremental PCA, which continuously tracks domain shifts.

Continuous surveillance of predictive model outputs offers a safe and reliable approach for identifying such distributional shifts without ground truth labels. However, most existing methods rely on centralized monitoring of aggregated predictions, overlooking site-specific drift dynamics. We propose an agent-based framework for detecting drift and assessing its severity in multisite clinical AI systems. To evaluate its effectiveness, we simulate a multi-center environment for output-based drift detection, assigning each site a drift monitoring agent that performs batch-wise comparisons of model outputs against a reference distribution. We analyse several multi-center monitoring schemes, that differ in how the reference is obtained (site-specific, global, production-only and adaptive), alongside a centralized baseline. Results on real-world breast cancer imaging data using a pathological complete response prediction model shows that all multi-center schemes outperform centralized monitoring, with F1-score improvements up to 10.3% in drift detection. In the absence of site-specific references, the adaptive scheme performs best, with F1-scores of 74.3% for drift detection and 83.7% for drift severity classification.

However, as organized crime groups are becoming more professional in real-world scenarios, fraudsters are employing more sophisticated camouflage strategies. Specifically, fraudsters disguise themselves by mimicking the behavioral data collected by platforms, ensuring that their key characteristics are consistent with those of benign users to a high degree, which we call Adaptive Camouflage. Consequently, this narrows the differences in behavioral traits between them and benign users within the platform's database, thereby making current GFD models lose efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a relation diffusion-based graph augmentation model Grad. In detail, Grad leverages a supervised graph contrastive learning module to enhance the fraud-benign difference and employs a guided relation diffusion generator to generate auxiliary homophilic relations from scratch. Based on these, weak fraudulent signals would be enhanced during the aggregation process, thus being obvious enough to be captured. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two real-world datasets provided by WeChat Pay, one of the largest online payment platforms with billions of users, and three public datasets.

Trained under the supervision of high-density LiDAR data (ALS), our model generates 2.5 m resolution height maps from freely available Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 (10 m) time series data. Evaluated on an open-source benchmark dataset in France, SERA-H, with a MAE of 2.6 m and a coefficient of determination of 0.82, not only outperforms standard Sentinel-1/2 baselines but also achieves performance comparable to or better than methods relying on commercial very high-resolution imagery (SPOT-6/7, PlanetScope, Maxar). These results demonstrate that combining high-resolution supervision with the spatiotemporal information embedded in time series enables the reconstruction of details beyond the input sensors' native resolution.

To better understand and mitigate this trade-off, we conduct a comprehensive study of reasoning strategies for reasoning models in RAG multi-hop QA tasks. Our findings reveal that reasoning models adopt structured strategies to integrate retrieved and internal knowledge, primarily following two modes: Context-Grounded Reasoning, which relies directly on retrieved content, and Knowledge-Reconciled Reasoning, which resolves conflicts or gaps using internal knowledge.

This paper proposes a post-hoc ITD framework that integrates explicit and implicit graph representations with temporal modelling to capture complex user behaviour patterns. An explicit graph is constructed using predefined organisational rules to model direct relationships among user activities. To mitigate noise and limitations in this hand-crafted structure, an implicit graph is learned from feature similarities using the Gumbel-Softmax trick, enabling the discovery of latent behavioural relationships. Separate Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) process the explicit and implicit graphs to generate node embeddings, which are concatenated and refined through an attention mechanism to emphasise threat-relevant features. The refined representations are then passed to a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies in user behaviour. Activities are flagged as anomalous when their probability scores fall below a predefined threshold. Extensive experiments on CERT r5.2 and r6.2 datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods. On r5.2, the model achieves an AUC of 98.62, a detection rate of 100%, and a false positive rate of 0.05.

This paper presents AgentInfer, a unified framework for end-to-end agent acceleration that bridges inference optimization and architectural design. We decompose the problem into four synergistic components: AgentCollab, a hierarchical dual-model reasoning framework that balances large- and small-model usage through dynamic role assignment; AgentSched, a cache-aware hybrid scheduler that minimizes latency under heterogeneous request patterns; AgentSAM, a suffix-automaton-based speculative decoding method that reuses multi-session semantic memory to achieve low-overhead inference acceleration; and AgentCompress, a semantic compression mechanism that asynchronously distills and reorganizes agent memory without disrupting ongoing reasoning. Together, these modules form a Self-Evolution Engine capable of sustaining efficiency and cognitive stability throughout long-horizon reasoning tasks. Experiments on the BrowseComp-zh and DeepDiver benchmarks demonstrate that through the synergistic collaboration of these methods, AgentInfer reduces ineffective token consumption by over 50%, achieving an overall 1.8-2.5 times speedup with preserved accuracy.

We introduce a Bayesian filtering framework to evaluate online inference in LLMs. Our probabilistic probe suite spans both multivariate discrete distributions, such as dice rolls, and continuous distributions, such as Gaussian processes, where ground-truth parameters shift over time. We find that while LLM belief updates resemble Bayesian posteriors, they are more accurately characterized by an exponential forgetting filter with a model-specific discount factor smaller than one. This reveals systematic discounting of older evidence that varies significantly across model architectures. Although inherent priors are often miscalibrated, the updating mechanism itself remains structured and principled. We further validate these findings in a simulated agent task and propose prompting strategies that effectively recalibrate priors with minimal computational cost."}

In this paper, we assume the similarity information is only available for a limited subset of node pairs and introduce FairExpand, a flexible framework that promotes individual fairness in this more realistic partial information scenario. FairExpand follows a two-step pipeline that alternates between refining node representations using a backbone model (e.g., a graph neural network) and gradually propagating similarity information, which allows fairness enforcement to effectively expand to the entire graph. Extensive experiments show that FairExpand consistently enhances individual fairness while preserving performance, making it a practical solution for enabling graph-based individual fairness in real-world applications with partial similarity information."}

The Generalized Resolution--Shell Dynamics (GRSD) framework models learning as spectral energy transport across logarithmic resolution shells, providing a coarse--grained dynamical description of training. Within GRSD, power--law scaling corresponds to a particularly simple renormalized shell dynamics; however, such behavior is not automatic and requires additional structural properties of the learning process.\n  In this work, we identify a set of sufficient conditions under which the GRSD shell dynamics admits a renormalizable coarse--grained description. These conditions constrain the learning configuration at multiple levels, including boundedness of gradient propagation in the computation graph, weak functional incoherence at initialization, controlled Jacobian evolution along training, and log--shift invariance of renormalized shell couplings. We further show that power--law scaling does not follow from renormalizability alone, but instead arises as a rigidity consequence: once log--shift invariance is combined with the intrinsic time--rescaling covariance of gradient flow, the renormalized GRSD velocity field is forced into a power--law form."}

While recent interactive foundation models (e.g., nnInteractive) enhance generalization through large-scale multimodal pretraining, they still depend on precise prompts and often perform below expectations in contexts that are underrepresented in their training data. We present AtlasSegFM, an atlas-guided framework that customizes available foundation models to clinical contexts with a single annotated example. The core innovations are: 1) a pipeline that provides context-aware prompts for foundation models via registration between a context atlas and query images, and 2) a test-time adapter to fuse predictions from both atlas registration and the foundation model. Extensive experiments across public and in-house datasets spanning multiple modalities and organs demonstrate that AtlasSegFM consistently improves segmentation, particularly for small, delicate structures. AtlasSegFM provides a lightweight, deployable solution one-shot customization of foundation models in real-world clinical workflows. The code will be made publicly available."}

The formulation follows a two-fluid approach: independent diffusion equations are discretized in each phase on a fixed staggered Cartesian grid, while the phases are coupled through embedded interface conditions enforcing continuity of normal flux and a general jump law. Cut cells are treated by integrating the governing equations over phase-restricted control volumes and faces, yielding discrete divergence and gradient operators that are locally conservative within each phase. Interface coupling is achieved by introducing a small set of interfacial unknowns per cut cell on the embedded boundary; the resulting algebraic system involves only bulk and interfacial averages. A key feature of the method is the use of a reduced set of geometric information based solely on low-order moments (trimmed volumes, apertures and interface measures/centroids), allowing robust implementation without constructing explicitly cut-cell polytopes. The method supports steady (Poisson) and unsteady (diffusion) regimes and incorporates Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin boundary conditions and general jumps. We validate the scheme on one-, two- and three-dimensional mono- and diphasic benchmarks, including curved embedded boundaries, Robin conditions and strong property/jump contrasts. The results demonstrate the expected convergence behavior, sharp enforcement of interfacial laws and excellent conservation properties. Extensions to moving interfaces and Stefan-type free-boundary problems are natural perspectives of this framework."}

However, when facing ambiguous natural language instructions (e.g., \"fetch the tool\" in a cluttered room), current agents often fail to balance the high cost of physical exploration against the cognitive cost of human interaction. They typically treat disambiguation as a passive perception problem, lacking the strategic reasoning to minimize total task execution costs. To bridge this gap, we propose ESearch-R1, a cost-aware embodied reasoning framework that unifies interactive dialogue (Ask), episodic memory retrieval (GetMemory), and physical navigation (Navigate) into a single decision process. We introduce HC-GRPO (Heterogeneous Cost-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization). Unlike traditional PPO which relies on a separate value critic, HC-GRPO optimizes the MLLM by sampling groups of reasoning trajectories and reinforcing those that achieve the optimal trade-off between information gain and heterogeneous costs (e.g., navigate time, and human attention). Extensive experiments in AI2-THOR demonstrate that ESearch-R1 significantly outperforms standard ReAct-based agents. It improves task success rates while reducing total operational costs by approximately 50\\%, validating the effectiveness of GRPO in aligning MLLM agents with physical world constraints."}

To address this training efficiency-stability trade-off, we introduce $\\textbf{MSSR}$ (Multimodal Stabilized Single-Rollout), a group-free RLVR framework that achieves both stable optimization and effective multimodal reasoning performance. MSSR achieves this via an entropy-based advantage-shaping mechanism that adaptively regularizes advantage magnitudes, preventing collapse and maintaining training stability. While such mechanisms have been used in group-based RLVR, we show that in the multimodal single-rollout setting they are not merely beneficial but essential for stability. In in-distribution evaluations, MSSR demonstrates superior training compute efficiency, achieving similar validation accuracy to the group-based baseline with half the training steps. When trained for the same number of steps, MSSR's performance surpasses the group-based baseline and shows consistent generalization improvements across five diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks. Together, these results demonstrate that MSSR enables stable, compute-efficient, and effective RLVR for complex multimodal reasoning tasks."}

This results in an infinite-dimensional nonlinear port-Hamiltonian (PH) system governed by partial differential-algebraic equations with a quadratic energy functional. Using a time-differentiated compliance form of the stress-strain relations allows for the imposition of kinematic constraints, such as inextensibility or shear-rigidity.

We attribute this effect to the weak alignment between policy performance and test loss, revealing substantial room for improvement through data selection. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective method, Stepwise Dual Ranking (SDR), which extracts a compact yet informative subset from large-scale offline behavioral datasets. SDR is build on two key principles: (1) stepwise clip, which prioritizes early-stage data; and (2) dual ranking, which selects samples with both high action-value rank and low state-density rank.

Exploring Source Distributions for Image Flow Matching", "comment": null, "summary": "Flow matching has emerged as a powerful generative modeling approach with flexible choices of source distribution. While Gaussian distributions are commonly used, the potential for better alternatives in high-dimensional data generation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel 2D simulation that captures high-dimensional geometric properties in an interpretable 2D setting, enabling us to analyze the learning dynamics of flow matching during training. Based on this analysis, we derive several key insights about flow matching behavior: (1) density approximation can paradoxically degrade performance due to mode discrepancy, (2) directional alignment suffers from path entanglement when overly concentrated, (3) Gaussian's omnidirectional coverage ensures robust learning, and (4) norm misalignment incurs substantial learning costs. Building on these insights, we propose a practical framework that combines norm-aligned training with directionally-pruned sampling. This approach maintains the robust omnidirectional supervision essential for stable flow learning, while eliminating initializations in data-sparse regions during inference. Importantly, our pruning strategy can be applied to any flow matching model trained with a Gaussian source, providing immediate performance gains without the need for retraining. Empirical evaluations demonstrate consistent improvements in both generation quality and sampling efficiency. Our findings provide practical insights and guidelines for source distribution design and introduce a readily applicable technique for improving existing flow matching models.

LoRA trains two ``adapter\" matrices that form a low-rank representation of the model parameters, thereby massively reducing the number of parameters that need to be updated at every step. Although LoRA is simple, its convergence is poorly understood due to the lack of Lipschitz smoothness, a key condition for classic convergence analyses. As a result, current theoretical results only consider asymptotic behavior or assume strong boundedness conditions which artificially enforce Lipschitz smoothness. In this work, we provide for the first time a non-asymptotic convergence analysis of the \\textit{original LoRA gradient descent} algorithm, which reflects widespread practice, without such assumptions. Our work relies on three key steps: i) reformulating the problem in terms of the outer product of the stacked adapter matrices, ii) a modified descent lemma for the ``Lipschitz-like\" reparametrized function, and iii) controlling the step size.

Due to the appealing advantages of these methods, intensive research is currently being carried out in this direction, as in the present work. Although the application of this type of method is very common in practice, there exist only a few works devoted to their theoretical analysis. In this work, we consider the so-called explicit fixed-stress split scheme, which consists of solving the flow problem first with time-lagging the displacement term, followed by the solution of the mechanics problem. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first convergence analysis of the explicit fixed-stress split scheme for Biot's equations. In particular, we prove that this algorithm is optimally convergent if the considered finite element discretization satisfies an inf-sup condition.

The introduced framework allows us to apply a pointwise divergence free finite element method as a discretization technique, leading to strongly mass conservative discrete fictitious domain method. A numerical example illustrates the performance of the method."}

We introduce an agentic framework for training general practitioner student skills that unifies (i) configurable, evidence-based vignette generation, (ii) controlled persona-driven patient dialogue with optional retrieval grounding, and (iii) standards-based assessment and feedback for both communication and clinical reasoning. We instantiate the framework in an interactive spoken consultation setting and evaluate it with medical students ($\\mathbf{N{=}14}$).

Conventional approaches, relying exclusively on historical price sequences, often neglect the semantic drivers of volatility such as policy uncertainty and market narratives. To address these limitations, we propose the ASTIF (Adaptive Semantic-Temporal Integration for Cryptocurrency Price Forecasting), a hybrid intelligent system that adapts its forecasting strategy in real time through confidence-based meta-learning. The framework integrates three complementary components. A dual-channel Small Language Model using MirrorPrompt extracts semantic market cues alongside numerical trends. A hybrid LSTM Random Forest model captures sequential temporal dependencies. A confidence-aware meta-learner functions as an adaptive inference layer, modulating each predictor's contribution based on its real-time uncertainty.\n  Experimental evaluation on a diverse dataset of AI-focused cryptocurrencies and major technology stocks from 2020 to 2024 shows that ASTIF outperforms leading deep learning and Transformer baselines (e.g., Informer, TFT). The ablation studies further confirm the critical role of the adaptive meta-learning mechanism, which successfully mitigates risk by shifting reliance between semantic and temporal channels during market turbulence. The research contributes a scalable, knowledge-based solution for fusing quantitative and qualitative data in non-stationary environments."}

These size-effects typically manifest themselves as a strengthening of the response in a form summarized as \"smaller is stiffer\". Moreover, the dynamical behavior of mechanical metamaterials is very remarkable, featuring unique phenomena such as dispersive behavior and band-gaps where elastic waves cannot propagate over specific frequency ranges. In these frequency ranges, the wavelength becomes gradually comparable to the unit-cell size, giving rise to microstructure related phenomena which become particularly visible in the reflection/transmission patterns where an incident wave hits the metamaterial's interfaces. This raises the question of whether the static size-effects and dynamic reflection/transmission patterns are correlated.\n  In this work, we investigate the interaction of the static size-effects and the dynamic scattering response of mechanical metamaterials by employing the relaxed micromorphic model. We introduce a two-stage optimization procedure to identify the material parameters. In the first stage, the static material parameters are identified by exploiting the static size-effects through a least squares fitting procedure based on the total energy. The dynamic parameters are determined in the second stage by fitting the dispersion curves of the relaxed micromorphic model to those of the fully discretized microstructure. At this second stage, we assess the results obtained by fitting the dispersion curves in one and in two propagation directions, for both the relaxed micromorphic model (RMM) with curvature and its reduced counterpart (RRMM) without curvature.\n  The full abstract is presented in the paper."}

We propose that chunking mechanisms play an essential role and show how the CogAct computational model grounds concept learning in fundamental cognitive processes and structures (such as chunking, attention, STM and LTM). First are the in-principle demonstrations, with CogAct automatically adapting to learn a range of categories from simple logical functions, to artificial categories, to natural raw (as opposed to natural pre-processed) concepts in the dissimilar domains of literature, chess and music. This kind of adaptive learning is difficult for most other psychological models, e.g., with cognitive models stopping at modelling artificial categories and (non-GPT) models based on deep learning requiring task-specific changes to the architecture. Secondly, we offer novel ways of designing human benchmarks for concept learning experiments and simulations accounting for subjectivity, ways to control for individual human experiences, all while keeping to real-life complex categories. We ground CogAct in simulations of subjective conceptual spaces of individual human participants, capturing humans subjective judgements in music, with the models learning from raw music score data without bootstrapping to pre-built knowledge structures. The CogAct simulations are compared to those obtained by a deep-learning model. These findings integrate concept learning and adaptation to complexity into the broader theories of cognitive psychology. Our approach may also be used in psychological applications that move away from modelling the average participant and towards capturing subjective concept space."}

In this work, we propose AL GNN, a novel framework for continual graph learning that eliminates the need for backpropagation and replay buffers. Instead, AL GNN leverages principles from analytic learning theory to formulate learning as a recursive least squares optimization process. It maintains and updates model knowledge analytically through closed form classifier updates and a regularized feature autocorrelation matrix. This design enables efficient one pass training for each task, and inherently preserves data privacy by avoiding historical sample storage. Extensive experiments on multiple dynamic graph classification benchmarks demonstrate that AL GNN achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing methods.

This study developed a quantitative framework to evaluate the spatial openness in housing from two- (2D) and three- (3D) dimensional perspectives. Using data from 4,004 rental units in Tokyo's 23 wards, we examined the temporal and spatial variations in openness and its relationship with rent and housing attributes. 2D openness was computed via planar visibility using visibility graph analysis (VGA) from floor plans, whereas 3D openness was derived from interior images analysed using Mask2Former, a semantic segmentation model that identifies walls, ceilings, floors, and windows. The results showed an increase in living room visibility and a 1990s peak in overall openness. Spatial analyses revealed partial correlations among openness, rent, and building characteristics, reflecting urban redevelopment trends. Although the 2D and 3D openness indicators were not directly correlated, higher openness tended to correspond to higher rent. The impression scores predicted by the existing models were only weakly related to openness, suggesting that the interior design and furniture more strongly shape perceived space. This study offers a new multidimensional data-driven framework for quantifying residential spatial openness and linking it with urban and market dynamics."}

Pretrained GloVe embeddings are used to represent words as dense vectors that preserve semantic similarity. The CNN layer extracts local n-gram patterns and lexical features, while the LSTM layer models long-range dependencies and sequential structure. The integrated Attention mechanism enables the model to focus selectively on the most informative parts of the input sequence. A 5-fold cross-validation setup was used to assess the robustness and generalizability of the proposed solution. Experimental results show that the hybrid LSTM-CNN-Attention model achieved outstanding performance, with an accuracy of 0.98, precision of 0.94, recall of 0.92, and F1-score of 0.93. These results surpass the performance of baseline models based solely on CNNs, LSTMs, or transformer-based classifiers such as BERT. The combination of neural network components enabled the model to effectively capture both fine-grained text structures and broader semantic context. Furthermore, the use of GloVe embeddings provided an efficient and effective representation of textual data, making the model suitable for integration into systems with real-time or near-real-time requirements. The proposed hybrid architecture demonstrates high effectiveness in text-based web content classification, particularly in tasks requiring both syntactic feature extraction and semantic interpretation. By combining presented mechanisms, the model addresses the limitations of individual architectures and achieves improved generalization.

This work identifies and characterizes a systematic spatial attention bias where VLMs consistently prioritize describing left-positioned content before right-positioned content in horizontally concatenated images. Through controlled experiments on image pairs using both open-source and closed-source models, we demonstrate that this bias persists across different architectures, with models describing left-positioned content first in approximately 97% of cases under neutral prompting conditions. Testing on an Arabic-finetuned model reveals that the bias persists despite right-to-left language training, ruling out language reading direction as the primary cause. Investigation of training dataset annotation guidelines from PixMo and Visual Genome reveals no explicit left-first ordering instructions, suggesting the bias is consistent with architectural factors rather than explicit training data instructions.

Beyond parameter efficiency with $O(LN + LG)$ scaling (where $G$ is the knot count of the shared splines) versus MLPs' $O(LN^2)$, SNs admit a sequential evaluation strategy that reduces peak forward-intermediate memory from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$ (treating batch size as constant), making much wider architectures feasible under memory constraints.

With a constructive approach, this study examines whether monkeys merely recognize objective reward differences or, instead, infer others' subjective reward valuations. We developed three computational models with varying degrees of social information processing: an Internal Prediction Model (IPM), which infers the partner's subjective values; a No Comparison Model (NCM), which disregards partner information; and an External Comparison Model (ECM), which directly incorporates the partner's objective rewards. To test model performance, we used a multi-layered, multimodal latent Dirichlet allocation. We trained the models on a dataset containing the behavior of a pair of monkeys, their rewards, and the conditioned stimuli. Then, we evaluated the models' ability to classify subjective values across pre-defined experimental conditions. The ECM achieved the highest classification score in the Rand Index (0.88 vs. 0.79 for the IPM) under our settings, suggesting that social comparison relies on objective reward differences rather than inferences about subjective states."}

Our system begins with a Vision-Transformer (ViT) depth network trained with metric-scale supervision, giving globally consistent depths despite wide field-of-view variations. A multi-scale feature bundle-adjustment (BA) layer refines camera poses directly in feature space--leveraging learned pyramidal descriptors instead of brittle keypoints--to suppress drift on unconstrained trajectories.

Most current methods rely on single-point estimates, which cannot distinguish true ability from outburst or carelessness, creating ambiguity in judging mastery. To address this issue, we propose a Knowledge Mastery-State Disambiguation for Knowledge Tracing model (KeenKT), which represents a student's knowledge state at each interaction using a Normal-Inverse-Gaussian (NIG) distribution, thereby capturing the fluctuations in student learning behaviors. Furthermore, we design an NIG-distance-based attention mechanism to model the dynamic evolution of the knowledge state. In addition, we introduce a diffusion-based denoising reconstruction loss and a distributional contrastive learning loss to enhance the model's robustness. Extensive experiments on six public datasets demonstrate that KeenKT outperforms SOTA KT models in terms of prediction accuracy and sensitivity to behavioral fluctuations. The proposed method yields the maximum AUC improvement of 5.85% and the maximum ACC improvement of 6.89%."}

While stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants have become the de facto standard for training deep networks, their success in these over-parameterized regimes often appears more empirical than principled. This thesis investigates this apparent paradox by tracing the evolution of optimization algorithms from classical first-order methods to modern higher-order techniques, revealing how principled algorithmic design can demystify the training process. Starting from first principles with SGD and adaptive gradient methods, the analysis progressively uncovers the limitations of these conventional approaches when confronted with anisotropy that is representative of real-world data. These breakdowns motivate the exploration of sophisticated alternatives rooted in curvature information: second-order approximation techniques, layer-wise preconditioning, adaptive learning rates, and more. Next, the interplay between these optimization algorithms and the broader neural network training toolkit, which includes prior and recent developments such as maximal update parametrization, learning rate schedules, and exponential moving averages, emerges as equally essential to empirical success. To bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical deployment, this paper offers practical prescriptions and implementation strategies for integrating these methods into modern deep learning workflows."}

To bridge this gap, we propose Semantic-Guided RIFE (SG-RIFE). Instead of training from scratch, we introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that augments a pre-trained RIFE backbone with semantic priors from a frozen DINOv3 Vision Transformer. We propose a Split-Fidelity Aware Projection Module (Split-FAPM) to compress and refine high-dimensional features, and a Deformable Semantic Fusion (DSF) module to align these semantic priors with pixel-level motion fields. Experiments on SNU-FILM demonstrate that semantic injection provides a decisive boost in perceptual fidelity. SG-RIFE outperforms diffusion-based LDMVFI in FID/LPIPS and achieves quality comparable to Consec.

Most models of learning and inference, however, presuppose a fixed representational basis within which belief updating occurs. In this paper, I address a prior question: under what structural conditions can the representational basis itself expand in a principled and selective way?\n  I propose a geometric framework in which conceptual growth is modeled as admissible basis extension evaluated under a Minimum Description Length (MDL) criterion. Experience, whether externally observed or internally simulated, is represented as vectors relative to a current conceptual subspace. Residual components capture systematic representational failure, and candidate conceptual extensions are restricted to low-rank, admissible transformations. I show that any MDL-accepted extension can be chosen so that its novel directions lie entirely within the residual span induced by experience, while extensions orthogonal to this span strictly increase description length and are therefore rejected.\n  This yields a conservative account of imagination and conceptual innovation. Internally generated counterfactual representations contribute to learning only insofar as they expose or amplify structured residual error, and cannot introduce arbitrary novelty. I further distinguish representational counterfactuals--counterfactuals over an agent's conceptual basis--from causal or value-level counterfactuals, and show how MDL provides a normative selection principle governing representational change.\n  Overall, the framework characterizes conceptual development as an error-driven, geometry-constrained process of basis extension, clarifying both the role and the limits of imagination in learning and theory change."}

We compare the performance of neologism learning against low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning, finding that neologisms outperform fine-tuned models under a matched training setup (same data and hyperparameters).

While existing jailbreak studies explore both single-turn and multi-turn strategies, most implicitly assume a static safety boundary and fail to account for how contextual interactions dynamically influence model behavior, leading to limited stability and generalization. Motivated by this gap, we propose MEEA (Mere Exposure Effect Attack), a psychology-inspired, fully automated black-box framework for evaluating multi-turn safety robustness, grounded in the mere exposure effect. MEEA leverages repeated low-toxicity semantic exposure to induce a gradual shift in a model's effective safety threshold, enabling progressive erosion of alignment constraints over sustained interactions. Concretely, MEEA constructs semantically progressive prompt chains and optimizes them using a simulated annealing strategy guided by semantic similarity, toxicity, and jailbreak effectiveness. Extensive experiments on both closed-source and open-source models, including GPT-4, Claude-3.5, and DeepSeek-R1, demonstrate that MEEA consistently achieves higher attack success rates than seven representative baselines, with an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) improvement exceeding 20%. Ablation studies further validate the necessity of both annealing-based optimization and contextual exposure mechanisms. Beyond improved attack effectiveness, our findings indicate that LLM safety behavior is inherently dynamic and history-dependent, challenging the common assumption of static alignment boundaries and highlighting the need for interaction-aware safety evaluation and defense mechanisms.

Seeds, as important archaeological artifacts, represent a fundamental subject of archaeobotanical research. However, traditional studies rely heavily on expert knowledge, which is often time-consuming and inefficient. Intelligent analysis methods have made progress in various fields of archaeology, but there remains a research gap in data and methods in archaeobotany, especially in the classification task of ancient plant seeds. To address this, we construct the first Ancient Plant Seed Image Classification (APS) dataset. It contains 8,340 images from 17 genus- or species-level seed categories excavated from 18 archaeological sites across China. In addition, we design a framework specifically for the ancient plant seed classification task (APSNet), which introduces the scale feature (size) of seeds based on learning fine-grained information to guide the network in discovering key \"evidence\" for sufficient classification. Specifically, we design a Size Perception and Embedding (SPE) module in the encoder part to explicitly extract size information for the purpose of complementing fine-grained information. We propose an Asynchronous Decoupled Decoding (ADD) architecture based on traditional progressive learning to decode features from both channel and spatial perspectives, enabling efficient learning of discriminative features. In both quantitative and qualitative analyses, our approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art image classification methods, achieving an accuracy of 90.5%.

Astonishingly, standard analyses of the time reported brain regions predictive of social emotions. The explanation, of course, was not supernatural cognition but a cautionary tale about misapplied statistical inference. In AI interpretability, reports of similar ''dead salmon'' artifacts abound: feature attribution, probing, sparse auto-encoding, and even causal analyses can produce plausible-looking explanations for randomly initialized neural networks. In this work, we examine this phenomenon and argue for a pragmatic statistical-causal reframing: explanations of computational systems should be treated as parameters of a (statistical) model, inferred from computational traces. This perspective goes beyond simply measuring statistical variability of explanations due to finite sampling of input data; interpretability methods become statistical estimators, and findings should be tested against explicit and meaningful alternative computational hypotheses, with uncertainty quantified with respect to the postulated statistical model. It also highlights important theoretical issues, such as the identifiability of common interpretability queries, which we argue is critical to understand the field's susceptibility to false discoveries, poor generalizability, and high variance. More broadly, situating interpretability within the standard toolkit of statistical inference opens promising avenues for future work aimed at turning AI interpretability into a pragmatic and rigorous science."}

However, existing expert pruning approaches conventionally rely on local importance metrics and often apply uniform layer-wise pruning, leveraging only partial evaluation signals and overlooking the heterogeneous contributions of experts across layers. To address these limitations, we propose an expert pruning approach based on the trajectory of activated experts across layers, which treats MoE as a weighted computation graph and casts expert selection as a global optimal path planning problem. Within this framework, we integrate complementary importance signals from reconstruction error, routing probabilities, and activation strength at the trajectory level, which naturally yields non-uniform expert retention across layers.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel protection method that jointly optimizes privacy suppression and utility preservation under a visual consistency constraint. While our method is conceptually effective, fair comparisons between methods remain challenging due to the lack of publicly available evaluation datasets. To fill this gap, we introduce VPI-COCO, a publicly available benchmark comprising 522 images with hierarchically structured privacy questions and corresponding non-private counterparts, enabling fine-grained and joint evaluation of protection methods in terms of privacy preservation and user experience. Building upon this benchmark, experiments on multiple VLMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces PAR below 25%, keeps NPAR above 88%, maintains high visual consistency, and generalizes well to unseen and paraphrased privacy questions, demonstrating its strong practical applicability for real-world VLM deployments."}

This paper seeks to understand the MLP layers in dense LLM models by hypothesizing that these layers secretly approximately perform a sparse computation -- namely, that they can be well approximated by sparsely-activating Mixture of Experts (MoE) layers.\n  Our hypothesis is based on a novel theoretical connection between MoE models and Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) structure in activation space. We empirically validate the hypothesis on pretrained LLMs, and demonstrate that the activation distribution matters -- these results do not hold for Gaussian data, but rather rely crucially on structure in the distribution of neural network activations.\n  Our results shine light on a general principle at play in MLP layers inside LLMs, and give an explanation for the effectiveness of modern MoE-based transformers. Additionally, our experimental explorations suggest new directions for more efficient MoE architecture design based on low-rank routers."}

As corporate online platforms grow more sophisticated in their design strategies, there is a pressing need for proactive and real-time detection technologies that go beyond the predominantly reactive approaches employed by regulatory authorities. In this paper, we propose a visual dark pattern detection framework that improves both detection accuracy and real-time performance. To this end, we constructed a proprietary visual object detection dataset by manually collecting 4,066 UI/UX screenshots containing dark patterns from 194 websites across six major industrial sectors in South Korea and abroad. The collected images were annotated with five representative UI components commonly associated with dark patterns: Button, Checkbox, Input Field, Pop-up, and QR Code. This dataset has been publicly released to support further research and development in the field. To enable real-time detection, this study adopted the YOLOv12x object detection model and applied transfer learning to optimize its performance for visual dark pattern recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves a high detection accuracy of 92.8% in terms of mAP@50, while maintaining a real-time inference speed of 40.5 frames per second (FPS), confirming its effectiveness for practical deployment in online environments. Furthermore, to facilitate future research and contribute to technological advancements, the dataset constructed in this study has been made publicly available at https://github.com/B4E2/B4E2-DarkPattern-YOLO-DataSet."}

LLM-CAS trains an agent to learn a policy that dynamically selects temporary neuron perturbations during inference based on the current context.

However, it faces a critical barrier in the modern era of low precision computing: numerical instability. As tiles scale to maximize efficiency (e.g., F(6,3), F(8,3)), the condition numbers of standard integer based transforms explode, reaching kappa = 2 x 10^5 for F(8,3), rendering them unusable in FP16 or Int8. We introduce NOVA (Numerical Optimization of Vandermonde Arithmetic), a discovery framework that breaks the decades old convention of integer interpolation. Treating Winograd point selection as a continuous optimization problem, NOVA searches the manifold R^n-1 via Evolution Strategy, snaps candidates to simple rationals, and guarantees correctness via symbolic verification. This process uncovers a hidden landscape of stable, fractional configurations such as {+-5/6, +-7/6, +-3/5} that defy traditional vocabulary constraints. The impact is transformative: NOVA improves the conditioning of F(8,3) by 415x in 1D, which squares to a 172,484x improvement for 2D convolution. In real world FP16 ImageNet inference, where standard transforms collapse to random chance (e.g., 4.7 percent accuracy on VGG16), NOVA's points restore full accuracy (75 to 78 percent), recovering over 70 percentage points without retraining, calibration, or learned parameters.

Recent advances have spurred significant interest in multimodal place recognition (MPR), which leverages complementary strengths of multiple modalities. Despite its potential, most existing MPR methods still face three key challenges: (1) dynamically adapting to arbitrary modality inputs within a unified framework, (2) maintaining robustness with missing or degraded modalities, and (3) generalizing across diverse sensor configurations and setups. In this paper, we propose UniMPR, a unified framework for multimodal place recognition. Using only one trained model, it can seamlessly adapt to any combination of common perceptual modalities (e.g., camera, LiDAR, radar). To tackle the data heterogeneity, we unify all inputs within a polar BEV feature space. Subsequently, the polar BEVs are fed into a multi-branch network to exploit discriminative intra-model and inter-modal features from any modality combinations. To fully exploit the network's generalization capability and robustness, we construct a large-scale training set from multiple datasets and introduce an adaptive label assignment strategy for extensive pre-training. Experiments on seven datasets demonstrate that UniMPR achieves state-of-the-art performance under varying sensor configurations, modality combinations, and environmental conditions.

Unlike traditional data-driven models, our approach does not require training data, supports inference with incomplete information, and is robust to noisy or uncertain observations. We report performance for two missions involving 11 and 9 casualties, respectively, where our Bayesian network model substantially outperformed vision-only baselines during evaluation of our system in the DARPA Triage Challenge (DTC) field scenarios. The accuracy of physiological assessment improved from 15% to 42% in the first scenario and from 19% to 46% in the second, representing nearly threefold increase in performance. More importantly, overall triage accuracy increased from 14% to 53% in all patients, while the diagnostic coverage of the system expanded from 31% to 95% of the cases requiring assessment. These results demonstrate that expert-knowledge-guided probabilistic reasoning can significantly enhance automated triage systems, offering a promising approach to supporting emergency responders in MCIs.

Reliable deployment therefore requires robust OOD detection, yet this is particularly challenging for irregular 3D graphs that combine continuous geometry with categorical identities and are unordered by construction. Here, we present a probabilistic OOD detection framework for complex 3D graph data built on a diffusion model that learns a density of the training distribution in a fully unsupervised manner. A key ingredient we introduce is a unified continuous diffusion over both 3D coordinates and discrete features: categorical identities are embedded in a continuous space and trained with cross-entropy, while the corresponding diffusion score is obtained analytically via posterior-mean interpolation from predicted class probabilities. This yields a single self-consistent probability-flow ODE (PF-ODE) that produces per-sample log-likelihoods, providing a principled typicality score for distribution shift. We validate the approach on protein-ligand complexes and construct strict OOD datasets by withholding entire protein families from training. PF-ODE likelihoods identify held-out families as OOD and correlate strongly with prediction errors of an independent binding-affinity model (GEMS), enabling a priori reliability estimates on new complexes. Beyond scalar likelihoods, we show that multi-scale PF-ODE trajectory statistics - including path tortuosity, flow stiffness, and vector-field instability - provide complementary OOD information. Modeling the joint distribution of these trajectory features yields a practical, high-sensitivity detector that improves separation over likelihood-only baselines, offering a label-free OOD quantification workflow for geometric deep learning."}

Although existing methods have extensively explored feature interaction between different modalities, they commonly rely on simple fusion strategies for feature aggregation. This introduces two critical flaws: it is prone to cross-modal noise and disrupts the hierarchical structure of the feature pyramid, thereby impairing the fine-grained detection of small objects. To address this challenge, we propose the Pyramidal Adaptive Cross-Gating Network (PACGNet), an architecture designed to perform deep fusion within the backbone. To this end, we design two core components: the Symmetrical Cross-Gating (SCG) module and the Pyramidal Feature-aware Multimodal Gating (PFMG) module. The SCG module employs a bidirectional, symmetrical \"horizontal\" gating mechanism to selectively absorb complementary information, suppress noise, and preserve the semantic integrity of each modality. The PFMG module reconstructs the feature hierarchy via a progressive hierarchical gating mechanism. This leverages the detailed features from a preceding, higher-resolution level to guide the fusion at the current, lower-resolution level, effectively preserving fine-grained details as features propagate. Through evaluations conducted on the DroneVehicle and VEDAI datasets, our PACGNet sets a new state-of-the-art benchmark, with mAP50 scores reaching 81.7% and 82.1% respectively."}

To address this challenge, we propose APF, a framework for solver-independent, automated problem formulation via LLMs designed to automatically convert engineers' natural language requirements into executable optimization models. The core of this framework is an innovative pipeline for automatically generating high-quality data, which overcomes the difficulty of constructing suitable fine-tuning datasets in the absence of high-cost solver feedback with the help of data generation and test instance annotation. The generated high-quality dataset is used to perform supervised fine-tuning on LLMs, significantly enhancing their ability to generate accurate and executable optimization problem formulations. Experimental results on antenna design demonstrate that APF significantly outperforms the existing methods in both the accuracy of requirement formalization and the quality of resulting radiation efficiency curves in meeting the design goals."}

First, we introduce a new benchmark suite of dynamic multimodal multiobjective test functions constructed by fusing the properties of both dynamic and multimodal optimization to establish a rigorous evaluation platform. Second, we propose a novel algorithm centered on a Clustering-based Autoencoder prediction dynamic response mechanism, which utilizes an autoencoder model to process matched clusters to generate a highly diverse initial population. Furthermore, to balance the algorithm's convergence and diversity, we integrate an adaptive niching strategy into the static optimizer. Empirical analysis on 12 instances of dynamic multimodal multiobjective test functions reveals that, compared with several state-of-the-art dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithms and multimodal multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, our algorithm not only preserves population diversity more effectively in the decision space but also achieves superior convergence in the objective space."}

To address this gap, we propose MemEvolve, a meta-evolutionary framework that jointly evolves agents' experiential knowledge and their memory architecture, allowing agent systems not only to accumulate experience but also to progressively refine how they learn from it. To ground MemEvolve in prior research and foster openness in future self-evolving systems, we introduce EvolveLab, a unified self-evolving memory codebase that distills twelve representative memory systems into a modular design space (encode, store, retrieve, manage), providing both a standardized implementation substrate and a fair experimental arena.

When experience is represented as a linear trajectory in Euclidean space, the geodesic distance between temporal events grows linearly with time, forcing the required covering number to diverge. In fixed-dimensional hardware, this volume expansion inevitably forces trajectory overlap, manifesting as catastrophic interference. In this work, we propose a geometric resolution to this paradox based on Recursive Metric Contraction. We formalize abstraction not as symbolic grouping, but as a topological deformation: a quotient map that collapses the metric tensor within validated temporal neighborhoods, effectively driving the diameter of local sub-manifolds to zero. We substantiate our framework with four rigorous results. First, the Bounded Capacity Theorem establishes that recursive quotient maps allow the embedding of arbitrarily long trajectories into bounded representational volumes, trading linear metric growth for logarithmic topological depth. Second, the Topological Collapse Separability Theorem, derived via Urysohn's Lemma, proves that recursive quotienting renders non-linearly separable temporal sequences linearly separable in the limit, bypassing the need for infinite-dimensional kernel projections. Third, the Parity-Partitioned Stability Theorem solves the catastrophic forgetting problem by proving that if the state space is partitioned into orthogonal flow and scaffold manifolds, the metric deformations of active learning do not disturb the stability of stored memories. Our analysis reveals that tokens in neural architectures are physically realizable as singularities or wormholes, regions of extreme positive curvature that bridge distant points in the temporal manifold."}

While recent advances in 3D reconstruction have enabled accurate approximations of scene geometry and appearance, these methods often fall short in relighting scenarios due to the lack of precise, spatially varying material parameters. At the same time, diffusion models operating on 2D images have shown strong performance in predicting physically based rendering (PBR) properties such as albedo, roughness, and metallicity. However, transferring these 2D material maps onto reconstructed 3D geometry remains a significant challenge. We propose a framework for fusing 2D material data into 3D geometry using a combination of novel learning-based and projection-based approaches. We begin by reconstructing scene geometry via Gaussian Splatting. From the input images, a diffusion model generates 2D maps for albedo, roughness, and metallic parameters. Any existing diffusion model that can convert images or videos to PBR materials can be applied. The predictions are further integrated into the 3D representation either by optimizing an image-based loss or by directly projecting the material parameters onto the Gaussians using Gaussian ray tracing. To enhance fine-scale accuracy and multi-view consistency, we further introduce a light-weight neural refinement step (Neural Merger), which takes ray-traced material features as input and produces detailed adjustments. Our results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform existing techniques in both quantitative metrics and perceived visual realism. This enables more accurate, relightable, and photorealistic renderings from reconstructed scenes, significantly improving the realism and efficiency of asset creation workflows in content production pipelines."}

Uniquely, we position RL as a deep alignment mechanism that enables the AI agent to internalize the optimality principles of OR, while simultaneously leveraging exploration for general policy refinement and allowing expert guidance for scenario-specific adaptation (e.g., promotional events). Validated through extensive numerical experiments and a field deployment at JD.com augmented by a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) analysis, our model significantly outperforms incumbent industrial practices, delivering real-world gains of a 5.27-day reduction in turnover and a 2.29% increase in in-stock rates, alongside a 29.95% decrease in holding costs. Contrary to the prevailing trend of brute-force model scaling, our study demonstrates that a lightweight, domain-informed model can deliver state-of-the-art performance and robust transferability when guided by structured OR logic. This approach offers a scalable and cost-effective paradigm for intelligent supply chain management, highlighting the value of deeply aligning AI with OR."}

In recent years, although deep learning has advanced the field of bone age assessment, existing methods face challenges in efficiently balancing global features and local skeletal details. This study aims to develop an automated bone age assessment system based on a two-stream deep learning architecture to achieve higher accuracy in bone age assessment. We propose the BoNet+ model incorporating global and local feature extraction channels. A Transformer module is introduced into the global feature extraction channel to enhance the ability in extracting global features through multi-head self-attention mechanism. A RFAConv module is incorporated into the local feature extraction channel to generate adaptive attention maps within multiscale receptive fields, enhancing local feature extraction capabilities. Global and local features are concatenated along the channel dimension and optimized by an Inception-V3 network. The proposed method has been validated on the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) and Radiological Hand Pose Estimation (RHPE) test datasets, achieving mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 3.81 and 5.65 months, respectively.

We study these questions in text-based environments, which provide a controlled setting to reinterpret language modeling as next-state prediction under interaction. We introduce a three-level framework for evaluating LLM-based world models: (i) fidelity and consistency, (ii) scalability and robustness, and (iii) agent utility. Across five representative environments, we find that sufficiently trained world models maintain coherent latent state, scale predictably with data and model size, and improve agent performance via action verification, synthetic trajectory generation, and warm-starting reinforcement learning.

Recent increases in drought severity, frequency, and duration underscore the need for effective monitoring and mitigation strategies. Predicting drought impacts rather than drought conditions alone offers opportunities to support early warning systems and proactive decision-making. This study applies machine learning techniques to link drought indices with historical drought impact records (2005:2024) to generate short-term impact forecasts. By addressing key conceptual and data-driven challenges regarding temporal scale and impact quantification, the study aims to improve the predictability of drought impacts at actionable lead times. The Drought Severity and Coverage Index (DSCI) and the Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) were combined with impact data from the Drought Impact Reporter (DIR) to model and forecast weekly drought impacts. Results indicate that Fire and Relief impacts were predicted with the highest accuracy, followed by Agriculture and Water, while forecasts for Plants and Society impacts showed greater variability. County and state level forecasts for New Mexico were produced using an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model that incorporated both DSCI and ESI. The model successfully generated forecasts up to eight weeks in advance using the preceding eight weeks of data for most impact categories. This work supports the development of an Ecological Drought Information Communication System (EcoDri) for New Mexico and demonstrates the potential for broader application in similar drought-prone regions. The findings can aid stakeholders, land managers, and decision-makers in developing and implementing more effective drought mitigation and adaptation strategies."}

Existing VI-based and texture-driven machine learning methods exhibit limited feature expressiveness.

Therefore, this study proposes the Multi-Channel Vegetation Indices Saturation Aware Net (MCVI-SANet), a lightweight semi-supervised vision model. The model incorporates a newly designed Vegetation Index Saturation-Aware Block (VI-SABlock) for adaptive channel-spatial feature enhancement. It also integrates a VICReg-based semi-supervised strategy to further improve generalization. Datasets were partitioned using a vegetation height-informed strategy to maintain representativeness across growth stages. Experiments over 10 repeated runs demonstrate that MCVI-SANet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. The model attains an average R2 of 0.8123 and RMSE of 0.4796 for LAI, and an average R2 of 0.6846 and RMSE of 2.4222 for SPAD. This performance surpasses the best-performing baselines, with improvements of 8.95% in average LAI R2 and 8.17% in average SPAD R2. Moreover, MCVI-SANet maintains high inference speed with only 0.10M parameters.

This approach reveals that nearly 60% of tokens across these independently collected corpora are duplicates, redundancy that any new scraping efforts will reproduce.

This paper investigates the classification of synthetic graph families using a hybrid approach that combines GNNs with engineered graph-theoretic features. We generate a large and structurally diverse synthetic dataset comprising graphs from five representative generative families, Erdos-Renyi, Watts-Strogatz, Barab'asi-Albert, Holme-Kim, and Stochastic Block Model. These graphs range in size up to 1x10^4 nodes, containing up to 1.1x10^5 edges. A comprehensive range of node and graph level features is extracted for each graph and pruned using a Random Forest based feature selection pipeline. The features are integrated into six GNN architectures: GCN, GAT, GATv2, GIN, GraphSAGE and GTN. Each architecture is optimised for hyperparameter selection using Optuna. Finally, models were compared against a baseline Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained solely on the handcrafted features. Our evaluation demonstrates that GraphSAGE and GTN achieve the highest classification performance, with 98.5% accuracy, and strong class separation evidenced by t-SNE and UMAP visualisations. GCN and GIN also performed well, while GAT-based models lagged due to limitations in their ability to capture global structures.

Evaluating the dynamics in such models is key to understanding their learned generative mechanisms. However, such evaluation is impeded by two major challenges: First, comparison of learned dynamics across models is difficult because there is no enforced equivalence of their coordinate systems. Second, identification of mechanistically important low-dimensional motifs (e.g., limit sets) is intractable in high-dimensional nonlinear models such as RNNs. Here, we propose a comprehensive framework to address these two issues, termed Diffeomorphic vector field alignment FOR learned Models (DFORM). DFORM learns a nonlinear coordinate transformation between the state spaces of two dynamical systems, which aligns their trajectories in a maximally one-to-one manner. In so doing, DFORM enables an assessment of whether two models exhibit topological equivalence, i.e., similar mechanisms despite differences in coordinate systems. A byproduct of this method is a means to locate dynamical motifs on low-dimensional manifolds embedded within higher-dimensional systems. We verified DFORM's ability to identify linear and nonlinear coordinate transformations using canonical topologically equivalent systems, RNNs, and systems related by nonlinear flows. DFORM was also shown to provide a quantification of similarity between topologically distinct systems. We then demonstrated that DFORM can locate important dynamical motifs including invariant manifolds and saddle limit sets within high-dimensional models. Finally, using a set of RNN models trained on human functional MRI (fMRI) recordings, we illustrated that DFORM can identify limit cycles from high-dimensional data-driven models, which agreed well with prior numerical analysis."}

However, state-of-the-art zero-shot methods typically rely on a sequence of surrogate likelihood functions, whose scores are used as proxies for the ideal score. This procedure however requires vector-Jacobian products through the denoiser at every reverse step, introducing significant memory and runtime overhead. To address this issue, we propose a new likelihood surrogate that yields simple and efficient to sample Gaussian posterior transitions, sidestepping the backpropagation through the denoiser network.

Building on research in artificial intelligence and translation studies, it proposes a human-centered framework that conceptualizes artificial intelligence as a means of amplifying the terminologist's capabilities, rather than replacing them. The framework is organized around three interrelated dimensions: the augmented terminologist, ethical AI, and human-centered design. Together, these dimensions emphasize the compatibility of high automation with strong human control, the central role of terminologists in bias mitigation, and the importance of designing AI tools and workflows around the needs, values, and well-being of the terminologist.

Both learning networks and knowledge graph representations can meaningfully coexist to preserve different aspects of data. While vectorized data are useful for probabilistic estimation, graphs preserve the intentionality of the source even under data fractionation. Using a Semantic Spacetime $γ(3,4)$ graph, one avoids complex ontologies in favour of classification of features by their roles in semantic processes.

To address these limitations, we introduce RecurGS, a recurrent fusion framework that incrementally integrates discrete Gaussian scene states into a single evolving representation capable of interaction. RecurGS detects object-level changes across consecutive states, aligns their geometric motion using semantic correspondence and Lie-algebra based SE(3) refinement, and performs recurrent updates that preserve historical structures through replay supervision. A voxelized, visibility-aware fusion module selectively incorporates newly observed regions while keeping stable areas fixed, mitigating catastrophic forgetting and enabling efficient long-horizon updates. RecurGS supports object-level manipulation, synthesizes novel scene states without requiring additional scans, and maintains photorealistic fidelity across evolving environments. Extensive experiments across synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework delivers high-quality reconstructions with substantially improved update efficiency, providing a scalable step toward continuously interactive Gaussian worlds."}

Our findings reveal a systematic misalignment where scaling up model size is not reliably helpful; instead of aligning with humans, models converge toward a shared machine consensus. We observe that high performance often impedes accurate difficulty estimation, as models struggle to simulate the capability limitations of students even when being explicitly prompted to adopt specific proficiency levels. Furthermore, we identify a critical lack of introspection, as models fail to predict their own limitations. These results suggest that general problem-solving capability does not imply an understanding of human cognitive struggles, highlighting the challenge of using current models for automated difficulty prediction."}

The experimental results on simulation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method. In particular, in the Hopper task, our method achieves an average return of 3441, surpassing the state-of-the-art method by 89. Our code will be available at https://github.com/positron-lpc/SD2AIL."}

Mosaics are an ancient art form created by arranging small pieces, called tesserae, on a surface using adhesive. Due to their age and fragility, they are prone to damage, highlighting the need for digital preservation. This paper addresses the problem of digitizing mosaics by segmenting the tesserae to separate them from the background within the broader field of Image Segmentation in Computer Vision. We propose a method leveraging Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) by Meta AI, a foundation model that outperforms most conventional segmentation models, to automatically segment mosaics. Due to the limited open datasets in the field, we also create an annotated dataset of mosaic images to fine-tune and evaluate the model. Quantitative evaluation on our testing dataset shows notable improvements compared to the baseline SAM 2 model, with Intersection over Union increasing from 89.00% to 91.02% and Recall from 92.12% to 95.89%. Additionally, on a benchmark proposed by a prior approach, our model achieves an F-measure 3% higher than previous methods and reduces the error in the absolute difference between predicted and actual tesserae from 0.20 to just 0.02. The notable performance of the fine-tuned SAM 2 model together with the newly annotated dataset can pave the way for real-time segmentation of mosaic images."}

Yet they remain black-box, offering little insight into their decision-making and often failing under real-world out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. We introduce Remedy-R, a reasoning-driven generative MT metric trained with reinforcement learning from pairwise translation preferences, without requiring error-span annotations or distillation from closed LLMs. Remedy-R produces step-by-step analyses of accuracy, fluency, and completeness, followed by a final score, enabling more interpretable assessments. With only 60K training pairs across two language pairs, Remedy-R remains competitive with top scalar metrics and GPT-4-based judges on WMT22-24 meta-evaluation, generalizes to other languages, and exhibits strong robustness on OOD stress tests. Moreover, Remedy-R models generate self-reflective feedback that can be reused for translation improvement. Building on this finding, we introduce Remedy-R Agent, a simple evaluate-revise pipeline that leverages Remedy-R's evaluation analysis to refine translations. This agent consistently improves translation quality across diverse models, including Qwen2.5, ALMA-R, GPT-4o-mini, and Gemini-2.0-Flash, suggesting that Remedy-R's reasoning captures translation-relevant information and is practically useful."}

While neural surrogates promise a paradigm shift, the field currently suffers from an \"illusion of mastery\", as repeatedly emphasized in top-tier commentaries: existing evaluations overly rely on simplified, low-dimensional proxies, which fail to expose the models' inherent fragility in realistic regimes. To bridge this critical gap, we present REALM (REalistic AI Learning for Multiphysics), a rigorous benchmarking framework designed to test neural surrogates on challenging, application-driven reactive flows. REALM features 11 high-fidelity datasets spanning from canonical multiphysics problems to complex propulsion and fire safety scenarios, alongside a standardized end-to-end training and evaluation protocol that incorporates multiphysics-aware preprocessing and a robust rollout strategy. Using this framework, we systematically benchmark over a dozen representative surrogate model families, including spectral operators, convolutional models, Transformers, pointwise operators, and graph/mesh networks, and identify three robust trends: (i) a scaling barrier governed jointly by dimensionality, stiffness, and mesh irregularity, leading to rapidly growing rollout errors; (ii) performance primarily controlled by architectural inductive biases rather than parameter count; and (iii) a persistent gap between nominal accuracy metrics and physically trustworthy behavior, where models with high correlations still miss key transient structures and integral quantities. Taken together, REALM exposes the limits of current neural surrogates on realistic multiphysics flows and offers a rigorous testbed to drive the development of next-generation physics-aware architectures."}

First, the Importance Prediction Module identifies and retains the most critical objects and relational triplets within an image while pruning irrelevant elements. Second, the Edge-Aware Graph Neural Network explicitly encodes relational structure and integrates global visual features to produce semantically informed image embeddings. PRISm achieves image retrieval that closely aligns with human perception by explicitly modeling the semantic importance of objects and their interactions, capabilities largely absent in prior approaches. Its architecture effectively combines relational reasoning with visual representation, enabling semantically grounded retrieval.

Unlike symbolic specification languages requiring parsers and compilers, FASTRIC leverages LLMs as unified infrastructure-simultaneously parser, interpreter, runtime environment, and development assistant. FASTRIC guides designers to articulate seven FSM elements (Final States, Agents, States, Triggers, Roles, Initial State, Constraints) structuring multi-turn interactions. Specification formality-ranging from implicit descriptions that frontier models infer to explicit step-by-step instructions for weaker models-serves as a design parameter. We introduce procedural conformance as verification metric measuring execution adherence to FSM specifications. Testing a 3-state kindergarten tutoring FSM across four formality levels and three model scales (14.7B, 685B, 1T+ parameters) reveals optimal specification formality is a function of model capacity. DeepSeek-V3.2 (685B) achieves perfect conformance (1.00) at L2-L4; ChatGPT-5 (~1T) peaks at L3 (0.90) before collapsing at L4 (0.39); Phi4 (14.7B) shows no stable optimum with high variance (SD=0.16-0.36).

We further expand task scope to explore generating post-prediction operations and search suggestions, and introduce a fine-grained metric to evaluate the practical utility of summaries, predictions, and suggestions. For rigorous assessment, we construct a UI trajectory dataset covering scenarios from UI-Agents (Agent-I) and real user interactions (Person-I).

Existing multi-prompt learning methods primarily focus on utilizing various meticulously designed prompts within a single foundation vision-language model to achieve superior performance. However, the overlooked model-prompt matching bias hinders the development of multi-prompt learning, i.e., the same prompt can convey different semantics across distinct vision-language models, such as CLIP-ViT-B/16 and CLIP-ViT-B/32, resulting in inconsistent predictions of identical prompt. To mitigate the impact of this bias on downstream tasks, we explore an ensemble learning approach to sufficiently aggregate the benefits of diverse predictions. Additionally, we further disclose the presence of sample-prompt matching bias, which originates from the prompt-irrelevant semantics encapsulated in the input samples. Thus, directly utilizing all information from the input samples for generating weights of ensemble learning can lead to suboptimal performance. In response, we extract prompt-relevant semantics from input samples by leveraging the guidance of the information theory-based analysis, adaptively calculating debiased ensemble weights. Overall, we propose Adaptive-Debiased Ensemble MultiPrompt Learning, abbreviated as AmPLe, to mitigate the two types of bias simultaneously. Extensive experiments on three representative tasks, i.e., generalization to novel classes, new target datasets, and unseen domain shifts, show that AmPLe can widely outperform existing methods. Theoretical validation from a causal perspective further supports the effectiveness of AmPLe."}

While acknowledging the power of long reasoning chains, we cannot help but wonder: Why do different reasoning chains perform differently in reasoning? What components of the reasoning chains play a key role? Existing studies mainly focus on evaluating reasoning chains from a functional perspective, with little attention paid to their structural mechanisms. To address this gap, this work is the first to analyze and evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from a structural perspective. We apply persistent homology from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to map reasoning steps into semantic space, extract topological features, and analyze structural changes. These changes reveal semantic coherence, logical redundancy, and identify logical breaks and gaps. By calculating homology groups, we assess connectivity and redundancy at various scales, using barcode and persistence diagrams to quantify stability and consistency. Our results show that the topological structural complexity of reasoning chains correlates positively with accuracy. More complex chains identify correct answers sooner, while successful reasoning exhibits simpler topologies, reducing redundancy and cycles, enhancing efficiency and interpretability. This work provides a new perspective on reasoning chain quality assessment and offers guidance for future optimization."}

To address these challenges, we present a novel approach that integrates a Digital Light Processing (DLP) projector, forming Active Structured Light (ASL) for RGB-D sensing. By combining the benefits of ECs and projection-based techniques, our method enables the detection of color and the depth of each pixel separately. Dynamic projection adjustments optimize bandwidth, ensuring selective color data acquisition and yielding colorful point clouds without sacrificing spatial resolution. This integration, facilitated by a commercial TI LightCrafter 4500 projector and a monocular monochrome EC, not only enables frameless RGB-D sensing applications but also achieves remarkable performance milestones.

We advance a complementary perspective: shorten the trajectory itself by starting closer to the target distribution through context-aware initialization.\n  We propose a training-free interface that injects prompt-conditioned priors from a lightweight auxiliary model into the diffusion initialization, and instantiate it with two mechanisms: discrete token injection and representation-level embedding interpolation. Because injected priors can be imperfect and unmask-only decoding can over-commit early, we also introduce a simple confidence-based remasking mechanism as a form of prior skepticism. Preliminary evidence on GSM8K suggests that context-aware initialization can substantially reduce denoising iterations (about 35\\% fewer function evaluations in our setting), while also exposing a key open challenge: naive warm-starting can degrade final accuracy relative to strong diffusion baselines.

We adopt a synthetic neuro-phenomenology approach: constructing artificial agents that embody these mechanisms to test their functional consequences through precise architectural ablations impossible in biological systems. Across three experiments, we report dissociations suggesting these theories describe complementary functional layers rather than competing accounts. In Experiment 1, a no-rewire Self-Model lesion abolishes metacognitive calibration while preserving first-order task performance, yielding a synthetic blindsight analogue consistent with HOT predictions. In Experiment 2, workspace capacity proves causally necessary for information access: a complete workspace lesion produces qualitative collapse in access-related markers, while partial reductions show graded degradation, consistent with GWT's ignition framework. In Experiment 3, we uncover a broadcast-amplification effect: GWT-style broadcasting amplifies internal noise, creating extreme fragility. The B2 agent family is robust to the same latent perturbation; this robustness persists in a Self-Model-off / workspace-read control, cautioning against attributing the effect solely to $z_{\\text{self}}$ compression. We also report an explicit negative result: raw perturbational complexity (PCI-A) decreases under the workspace bottleneck, cautioning against naive transfer of IIT-adjacent proxies to engineered agents. These results suggest a hierarchical design principle: GWT provides broadcast capacity, while HOT provides quality control.

In this work, we treat interactions as the fundamental units of such structure and investigate a largely unexplored question: how DNNs encode interactions under different levels of contextual complexity, and how these microscopic interaction patterns shape macroscopic representation capacity. To quantify this complexity, we use multi-order interactions [57], where each order reflects the amount of contextual information required to evaluate the joint interaction utility of a variable pair. This formulation enables a stratified analysis of cooperative patterns learned by DNNs. Building on this formulation, we develop a comprehensive study of interaction structure in DNNs. (i) We empirically discover a universal interaction bottleneck: across architectures and tasks, DNNs easily learn low-order and high-order interactions but consistently under-represent mid-order ones. (ii) We theoretically explain this bottleneck by proving that mid-order interactions incur the highest contextual variability, yielding large gradient variance and making them intrinsically difficult to learn. (iii) We further modulate the bottleneck by introducing losses that steer models toward emphasizing interactions of selected orders. Finally, we connect microscopic interaction structures with macroscopic representational behavior: low-order-emphasized models exhibit stronger generalization and robustness, whereas high-order-emphasized models demonstrate greater structural modeling and fitting capability. Together, these results uncover an inherent representational bias in modern DNNs and establish interaction order as a powerful lens for interpreting and guiding deep representations."}

As a running example, we focus on Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS), which, despite its apparent simplicity, requires sequential reasoning, adaptation, and strategy recognition. Our system positions the LLM as an Observer whose task is to identify which strategies are being played and to articulate the reasoning behind this judgment. The purpose is not to test knowledge of Rock-Paper-Scissors itself, but to probe whether the model can exhibit mind-like reasoning about sequential behavior. To support systematic evaluation, we provide a benchmark consisting of both static strategies and lightweight dynamic strategies specified by well-prompted rules. We quantify alignment between the Observer's predictions and the ground-truth distributions induced by actual strategy pairs using three complementary signals: Cross-Entropy, Brier score, and Expected Value (EV) discrepancy. These metrics are further integrated into a unified score, the Union Loss, which balances calibration, sensitivity, and payoff alignment. Together with a Strategy Identification Rate (SIR) metric, our framework captures not only predictive accuracy but also whether the model can stably identify the latent strategies in play. The demo emphasizes interactivity, transparency, and reproducibility.

Focusing on the core independence issue under covariance stationarity, this paper aims to provide a first-principles analysis of the Expectation of Optimization Bias (EOB), formalizing it information-theoretically as the discrepancy between the true joint distribution and its flawed i.i.d. counterpart. Our analysis reveals a fundamental paradigm paradox: the more deterministic and structured the time series, the more severe the bias by point-wise loss function. We derive the first closed-form quantification for the non-deterministic EOB across linear and non-linear systems, and prove EOB is an intrinsic data property, governed exclusively by sequence length and our proposed Structural Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SSNR). This theoretical diagnosis motivates our principled debiasing program that eliminates the bias through sequence length reduction and structural orthogonalization. We present a concrete solution that simultaneously achieves both principles via DFT or DWT. Furthermore, a novel harmonized $\\ell_p$ norm framework is proposed to rectify gradient pathologies of high-variance series.

However, such representations often fail to capture fine-grained object semantics and appearance, which are crucial for localizing moments described by object-oriented queries involving specific entities and their interactions. In particular, temporal dynamics at the object level have been largely overlooked, limiting the effectiveness of existing approaches in scenarios requiring detailed object-level reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric framework for moment retrieval. Our method first extracts query-relevant objects using a scene graph parser and then generates scene graphs from video frames to represent these objects and their relationships. Based on the scene graphs, we construct object-level feature sequences that encode rich visual and semantic information. These sequences are processed by a relational tracklet transformer, which models spatio-temporal correlations among objects over time. By explicitly capturing object-level state changes, our framework enables more accurate localization of moments aligned with object-oriented queries. We evaluated our method on three benchmarks: Charades-STA, QVHighlights, and TACoS. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks."}

Most existing methods rely on embedding entities and relations into continuous geometric spaces and answer queries via differentiable set operations. While effective for simple query patterns, these approaches often struggle to generalize to complex queries involving multiple operators, deeper reasoning chains, or heterogeneous KG schemas. We propose ROG (Reasoning Over knowledge Graphs with large language models), an ensemble-style framework that combines query-aware KG neighborhood retrieval with large language model (LLM)-based chain-of-thought reasoning. ROG decomposes complex FOL queries into sequences of simpler sub-queries, retrieves compact, query-relevant subgraphs as contextual evidence, and performs step-by-step logical inference using an LLM, avoiding the need for task-specific embedding optimization. Experiments on standard KG reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ROG consistently outperforms strong embedding-based baselines in terms of mean reciprocal rank (MRR), with particularly notable gains on high-complexity query types. These results suggest that integrating structured KG retrieval with LLM-driven logical reasoning offers a robust and effective alternative for complex KG reasoning tasks."}

One approach involves the use of plausibility checks, rule-based procedures that assess the correctness and internal consistency of data, to detect anomalies or signs of manipulation. Although these verification procedures are essential for ensuring data integrity, existing plausibility checks are manually implemented by software engineers, which is time-consuming. Recent advances in code generation with large language models (LLMs) offer new potential for automating and scaling the generation of these checks. However, adapting LLMs to the specific requirements of an unknown domain remains a significant challenge. This work investigates the extent to which LLMs, adapted on domain-specific code and data through different fine-tuning strategies, can generate rule-based plausibility checks for forgery detection on constrained hardware resources. We fine-tune open-source LLMs, Llama 3.1 8B and OpenCoder 8B, on structured datasets derived from real-world application scenarios and evaluate the generated plausibility checks on previously unseen forgery patterns. The results demonstrate that the models are capable of generating executable and effective verification procedures. This also highlights the potential of LLMs as scalable tools to support human decision-making in security-sensitive contexts where comprehensibility is required."}

For clinical applications, traceability, defined as the ability to provide pixel-level correspondences between original and translated images, is equally important. This property enhances clinical interpretability but has been largely overlooked in previous approaches. To address this gap, we propose Plasticine, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first end-to-end image-to-image translation framework explicitly designed with traceability as a core objective. Our method combines intensity translation and spatial transformation within a denoising diffusion framework. This design enables the generation of synthetic images with interpretable intensity transitions and spatially coherent deformations, supporting pixel-wise traceability throughout the translation process."}

In this work, we study how the choice of pretraining data distribution steers a shallow transformer toward one behavior or the other. Focusing on a minimal trigger-output prediction task -- copying the token immediately following a special trigger upon its second occurrence -- we present a rigorous analysis of gradient-based training of a single-layer transformer. In both the infinite and finite sample regimes, we prove a transition in the learned mechanism: if input sequences exhibit sufficient diversity, measured by a low ``max-sum'' ratio of trigger-to-trigger distances, the trained model implements an induction head and generalizes to unseen contexts; by contrast, when this ratio is large, the model resorts to a positional shortcut and fails to generalize out-of-distribution (OOD). We also reveal a trade-off between the pretraining context length and OOD generalization, and derive the optimal pretraining distribution that minimizes computational cost per sample. Finally, we validate our theoretical predictions with controlled synthetic experiments, demonstrating that broadening context distributions robustly induces induction heads and enables OOD generalization. Our results shed light on the algorithmic biases of pretrained transformers and offer conceptual guidelines for data-driven control of their learned behaviors."}

However, handling high-dimensional visual features often incurs substantial computational and memory costs. VoCo-LLaMA alleviates this issue by compressing visual patch tokens into a few VoCo tokens, reducing computational overhead while preserving strong cross-modal alignment. Nevertheless, such approaches typically adopt a fixed compression rate, limiting their ability to adapt to varying levels of visual complexity. To address this limitation, we propose Adaptive-VoCo, a framework that augments VoCo-LLaMA with a lightweight predictor for adaptive compression. This predictor dynamically selects an optimal compression rate by quantifying an image's visual complexity using statistical cues from the vision encoder, such as patch token entropy and attention map variance. Furthermore, we introduce a joint loss function that integrates rate regularization with complexity alignment. This enables the model to balance inference efficiency with representational capacity, particularly in challenging scenarios. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms fixed-rate baselines across multiple multimodal tasks, highlighting the potential of adaptive visual compression for creating more efficient and robust VLMs."}

Existing methods primarily address the stability-plasticity dilemma through mechanisms where past knowledge influences optimization but rarely affects the agent's behavior directly, which may hinder effective knowledge reuse and efficient learning.

To address the inherent spatiotemporal heterogeneity of EEG signals, this paper proposes a multi-branch parallel architecture, where each temporal scale is equipped with an independent spatial feature extraction module. To further enhance multi-branch feature fusion, we propose a Fusion of Multiscale Features via Centralized Sparse-attention Network (EEG-CSANet), a centralized sparse-attention network. It employs a main-auxiliary branch architecture, where the main branch models core spatiotemporal patterns via multiscale self-attention, and the auxiliary branch facilitates efficient local interactions through sparse cross-attention. Experimental results show that EEG-CSANet achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across five public datasets (BCIC-IV-2A, BCIC-IV-2B, HGD, SEED, and SEED-VIG), with accuracies of 88.54%, 91.09%, 99.43%, 96.03%, and 90.56%, respectively. Such performance demonstrates its strong adaptability and robustness across various EEG decoding tasks. Moreover, extensive ablation studies are conducted to enhance the interpretability of EEG-CSANet. In the future, we hope that EEG-CSANet could serve as a promising baseline model in the field of EEG signal decoding.

We identify the root cause as modal asymmetry: while the visual encoder can extract discriminative features from unseen images, the text encoder is constrained by a fixed discrete vocabulary and cannot synthesize new semantic anchors. Existing approaches such as CoOp or LoRA provide only partial remedies, as they remain confined to the pre-trained semantic space.\n  To overcome this bottleneck, we propose dynamic representation optimization, realized through the Guided Target-Matching Adaptation (GTMA) framework. At inference time, GTMA constructs a continuous pseudo-word embedding that best aligns with an OOD image's visual anchor, effectively bypassing vocabulary limitations. The optimization is driven by an adaptive gradient-based representation policy optimization algorithm, which incorporates semantic regularization to preserve plausibility and compatibility with the model's prior knowledge.\n  Experiments on ImageNet-R and the VISTA-Beyond benchmark demonstrate that GTMA improves zero-shot and few-shot OOD accuracy by up to 15-20 percent over the base VLM while maintaining performance on in-distribution concepts. Ablation studies further confirm the necessity of pseudo-word optimization."}

This paper presents a case study on developing a professional subtitling system for an Italian media company. To inform our system design, we evaluated four state-of-the-art ASR models (Whisper Large v2, AssemblyAI Universal, Parakeet TDT v3 0.6b, and WhisperX) on a 50-hour dataset of Italian television programs. The study highlights their strengths and limitations, benchmarking their performance against the work of professional human subtitlers. The findings indicate that, while current models cannot meet the media industry's accuracy needs for full autonomy, they can serve as highly effective tools for enhancing human productivity.

This iterative refinement continues until convergence criteria are met. We formalize the feedback mechanism, prove convergence properties under mild assumptions, and provide a complete algorithmic framework."}

To discover risky samples, previous literature attempts to search for patterns of risky samples within existing datasets or inject perturbation into them. Yet in this way the diversity of risky samples is limited by the coverage of existing datasets. To overcome this limitation, recent works adopt diffusion models to produce new risky samples beyond the coverage of existing datasets. However, these methods struggle in the conformity between generated samples and expected categories, which could introduce label noise and severely limit their effectiveness in applications. To address this issue, we propose RiskyDiff that incorporates the embeddings of both texts and images as implicit constraints of category conformity. We also design a conformity score to further explicitly strengthen the category conformity, as well as introduce the mechanisms of embedding screening and risky gradient guidance to boost the risk of generated samples. Extensive experiments reveal that RiskyDiff greatly outperforms existing methods in terms of the degree of risk, generation quality, and conformity with conditioned categories. We also empirically show the generalization ability of the models can be enhanced by augmenting training data with generated samples of high conformity."}

This paper presents a robust detection framework that leverages multiple uncertainty measures to decide whether to trust or reject a model's predictions. We focus on three complementary techniques: Fisher Information, which captures the sensitivity of model parameters to input variations; entropy-based uncertainty from Monte Carlo Dropout, which reflects predictive variability; and predictive variance from a Deep Kernel Learning framework using a Gaussian Process classifier. To integrate these diverse uncertainty signals, Particle Swarm Optimisation is used to learn optimal weightings and determine an adaptive rejection threshold. The model is trained on Stable Diffusion-generated images and evaluated on GLIDE, VQDM, Midjourney, BigGAN, and StyleGAN3, each introducing significant distribution shifts. While standard metrics such as prediction probability and Fisher-based measures perform well in distribution, their effectiveness degrades under shift. In contrast, the Combined Uncertainty measure consistently achieves an incorrect rejection rate of approximately 70 percent on unseen generators, successfully filtering most misclassified AI samples. Although the system occasionally rejects correct predictions from newer generators, this conservative behaviour is acceptable, as rejected samples can support retraining. The framework maintains high acceptance of accurate predictions for natural images and in-domain AI data. Under adversarial attacks using FGSM and PGD, the Combined Uncertainty method rejects around 61 percent of successful attacks, while GP-based uncertainty alone achieves up to 80 percent. Overall, the results demonstrate that multi-source uncertainty fusion provides a resilient and adaptive solution for AI-generated image detection."}

Nevertheless, existing interference prediction approaches remain limited in several respects, which may restrict their usefulness for scheduling. First, they are often coarse-grained, which ignores runtime co-location dynamics and thus restricts their accuracy in interference prediction.

The question is how to learn goal-conditioned and general policies when the training instances are large and the goal cannot be reached by random exploration alone. The technique of Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) provides an answer to this question: it relabels unsuccessful trajectories as successful ones by replacing the original goal with one that was actually achieved. If the target policy must generalize across states and goals, trajectories that do not reach the original goal states can enable more data- and time-efficient learning. In this work, we show that further performance gains can be achieved when states and goals are represented by sets of atoms. We consider three versions: goals as full states, goals as subsets of the original goals, and goals as lifted versions of these subgoals. The result is that the latter two successfully learn general policies on large planning instances with sparse rewards by automatically creating a curriculum of easier goals of increasing complexity. The experiments illustrate the computational gains of these versions, their limitations, and opportunities for addressing them."}

This yields monotonic KL convergence to a high-quality stationary distribution, bounded hitting times to superior states, and exponential mixing governed by the spectral gap.\n  For reasoning models trained with verifiable rewards (RLVR), we show the objective is equivalent to expected KL minimization toward an optimal reasoning distribution, with the suboptimality gap reducing to the Bernoulli KL between target and current accuracies along the natural gradient flow.

Furthermore, what social features of stigmas are associated with bias in LLM outputs is unknown. From psychology literature, it has been shown that stigmas contain six shared social features: aesthetics, concealability, course, disruptiveness, origin, and peril. In this study, we investigate if human and LLM ratings of the features of stigmas, along with prompt style and type of stigma, have effect on bias towards stigmatized groups in LLM outputs. We measure bias against 93 stigmatized groups across three widely used LLMs (Granite 3.0-8B, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B) using SocialStigmaQA, a benchmark that includes 37 social scenarios about stigmatized identities; for example deciding wether to recommend them for an internship. We find that stigmas rated by humans to be highly perilous (e.g., being a gang member or having HIV) have the most biased outputs from SocialStigmaQA prompts (60% of outputs from all models) while sociodemographic stigmas (e.g. Asian-American or old age) have the least amount of biased outputs (11%). We test if the amount of biased outputs could be decreased by using guardrail models, models meant to identify harmful input, using each LLM's respective guardrail model (Granite Guardian 3.0, Llama Guard 3.0, Mistral Moderation API). We find that bias decreases significantly by 10.4%, 1.4%, and 7.8%, respectively. However, we show that features with significant effect on bias remain unchanged post-mitigation and that guardrail models often fail to recognize the intent of bias in prompts. This work has implications for using LLMs in scenarios involving stigmatized groups and we suggest future work towards improving guardrail models for bias mitigation."}

The problem of generalization has been addressed formally in classical planning where provable correct policies that generalize over all instances of a given domain have been learned using combinatorial methods. The aim of this work is to bring these two research threads together to illuminate the conditions under which (deep) reinforcement learning approaches, and in particular, policy optimization methods, can be used to learn policies that generalize like combinatorial methods do. We draw on lessons learned from previous combinatorial and deep learning approaches, and extend them in a convenient way. From the former, we model policies as state transition classifiers, as (ground) actions are not general and change from instance to instance. From the latter, we use graph neural networks (GNNs) adapted to deal with relational structures for representing value functions over planning states, and in our case, policies. With these ingredients in place, we find that actor-critic methods can be used to learn policies that generalize almost as well as those obtained using combinatorial approaches while avoiding the scalability bottleneck and the use of feature pools. Moreover, the limitations of the DRL methods on the benchmarks considered have little to do with deep learning or reinforcement learning algorithms, and result from the well-understood expressive limitations of GNNs, and the tradeoff between optimality and generalization (general policies cannot be optimal in some domains). Both of these limitations are addressed without changing the basic DRL methods by adding derived predicates and an alternative cost structure to optimize."}

We introduce Schedule Deviation, a rigorous measure which captures the rate of deviation from a standard denoising process, and provide a methodology to compute it. Crucially, we demonstrate that the deviation from an idealized denoising process occurs irrespective of the model capacity or amount of training data. We posit that this phenomenon occurs due to the difficulty of bridging distinct denoising flows across different parts of the conditioning space and show theoretically how such a phenomenon can arise through an inductive bias towards smoothness."}

Conversely, existing training-free methods avoid these issues but rely on surface-level prompting, failing to provide the fine-grained atom-level priors essential for precise chemical reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce ChemATP, a framework that decouples chemical knowledge from the reasoning engine.

To bridge this gap, we introduce EchoTrail-GUI, a novel framework designed to mimic human-like experiential learning by equipping agents with a dynamic, accessible memory. Our framework operates in three distinct stages. First, during Experience Exploration, an agent autonomously interacts with GUI environments to build a curated database of successful task trajectories, validated by a reward model. Crucially, the entire knowledge base construction is thus fully automated, requiring no human supervision. Second, in the Memory Injection stage, upon receiving a new task, our system efficiently retrieves the most relevant past trajectories to serve as actionable ''memories''. Finally, during GUI Task Inference, these memories are injected as in-context guidance to inform the agent's reasoning and decision-making process. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on benchmarks including Android World and AndroidLab.

A fundamental challenge in observational data is that while we need to infer outcome differences under alternative treatments, we can only observe each individual's outcome under a single treatment. Existing approaches address this limitation either by training with inferred pseudo-outcomes or by creating matched instance pairs. However, recent work has largely overlooked the potential impact of post-treatment variables on the outcome. This oversight prevents existing methods from fully capturing outcome variability, resulting in increased variance in counterfactual predictions. This paper introduces Pseudo-outcome Imputation with Post-treatment Variables for Counterfactual Regression (PIPCFR), a novel approach that incorporates post-treatment variables to improve pseudo-outcome imputation. We analyze the challenges inherent in utilizing post-treatment variables and establish a novel theoretical bound for ITE risk that explicitly connects post-treatment variables to ITE estimation accuracy.

This paper presents the first study on out-of-view (OOV) understanding, i.e., the ability to reason objects, activities, and scenes beyond the visible frame of a perspective view. Our technical contributions are threefold. First, we design OpenView, a four-stage pipeline to massively generate multi-choice VQA by leveraging panoramic imagery to enable context-rich and spatial-grounded VQA synthesis with free-view framing. Second, we curate OpenView-Dataset, a high-quality synthetic dataset from diverse real-world panoramas to empower MLLMs upon supervised fine-tuning. Third, we build OpenView-Bench, a benchmark that jointly measures choice and rationale accuracy for interpretable and diagnosable evaluation. Experimental results show that despite having a large gap from human performance in OOV VQA answer selection, upon empowered by OpenView, multiple MLLMs can consistently boost their performance, uplifted from 48.6% to 64.1% on average.

In this paper, we propose a novel prompt optimization pipeline for frame detection in logistics texts, combining retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, and automatic CoT synthesis (Auto-CoT) to generate highly effective task-specific prompts. Central to our approach is an LLM-based prompt optimizer agent that iteratively refines the prompts using retrieved examples, performance feedback, and internal self-evaluation. Our framework is evaluated on a real-world logistics text annotation task, where reasoning accuracy and labeling efficiency are critical. Experimental results show that the optimized prompts - particularly those enhanced via Auto-CoT and RAG - improve real-world inference accuracy by up to 15% compared to baseline zero-shot or static prompts. The system demonstrates consistent improvements across multiple LLMs, including GPT-4o, Qwen 2.5 (72B), and LLaMA 3.1 (70B), validating its generalizability and practical value. These findings suggest that structured prompt optimization is a viable alternative to full fine-tuning, offering scalable solutions for deploying LLMs in domain-specific NLP applications such as logistics."}

They are further embedded within Bellman residuals, where their learnable parameters -- a fixed number of mixing weights, together with Gaussian mean vectors and covariance matrices -- are inferred from data via optimization on a Riemannian manifold. This geometric perspective on the parameter space naturally incorporates Riemannian optimization into the policy-evaluation step of standard policy-iteration frameworks. Rigorous theoretical results are established, and supporting numerical tests show that, even without access to experience data, GMM-QFs deliver competitive performance and, in some cases, outperform state-of-the-art approaches across a range of benchmark RL tasks, all while maintaining a significantly smaller computational footprint than deep-learning methods that rely on experience data."}

To systematically assess how the choice of LLM family, size, precision regime, and prompting strategy affect performance, we run a large factorial study in models, precisions, and prompt engineering techniques. An additional response parsing step nearly eliminates format errors while preserving accuracy; larger models deliver the strongest and most stable performance, while quantization offers substantial efficiency gains with modest accuracy trade-offs; and prompt strategies show heterogeneous, model-specific effects.

However, it remains unclear whether state-of-the-art vision perception models (e.g., large VLMs) can reason physical properties quantitatively. Existing evaluations are predominantly VQA-based and qualitative, offering limited insight into whether these models can infer the kinematic quantities of moving objects from video observations. To address this, we present QuantiPhy, the first benchmark designed to quantitatively measure a VLM's physical reasoning ability. Comprising more than 3.3K video-text instances with numerical ground truth, QuantiPhy evaluates a VLM's performance on estimating an object's size, velocity, and acceleration at a given timestamp, using one of these properties as an input prior. The benchmark standardizes prompts and scoring to assess numerical accuracy, enabling fair comparisons across models. Our experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs reveal a consistent gap between their qualitative plausibility and actual numerical correctness. We further provide an in-depth analysis of key factors like background noise, counterfactual priors, and strategic prompting and find that state-of-the-art VLMs lean heavily on pre-trained world knowledge rather than faithfully using the provided visual and textual inputs as references when reasoning kinematic properties quantitatively. QuantiPhy offers the first rigorous, scalable testbed to move VLMs beyond mere verbal plausibility toward a numerically grounded physical understanding."}

Existing semi-supervised methods typically treat data as purely numerical and} in a deterministic manner, thereby neglecting the heterogeneity and uncertainty inherent in complex, real-world datasets. This paper introduces a label-informed outlier detection method for heterogeneous data based on Granular Computing and Fuzzy Sets, namely Granule Density-based Outlier Factor (GDOF). Specifically, GDOF first employs label-informed fuzzy granulation to effectively represent various data types and develops granule density for precise density estimation. Subsequently, granule densities from individual attributes are integrated for outlier scoring by assessing attribute relevance with a limited number of labeled outliers. Experimental results on various real-world datasets show that GDOF stands out in detecting outliers in heterogeneous data with a minimal number of labeled outliers. The integration of Fuzzy Sets and Granular Computing in GDOF offers a practical framework for outlier detection in complex and diverse data types. All relevant datasets and source codes are publicly available for further research. This is the author's accepted manuscript of a paper published in IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems.

Inspired by this, this paper proposes a new LLM-Centric Lifelong Empathic Motion Generation (L^2-EMG) task, which aims to equip LLMs with the capability to continually acquire emotional motion generation knowledge across different unseen scenarios, potentially contributing to building a closed-loop and self-evolving embodied agent equipped with both empathy and intelligence. Further, this paper poses two key challenges in the L^2-EMG task, i.e., the emotion decoupling challenge and the scenario adapting challenge. To this end, this paper proposes an Emotion-Transferable and Scenario-Adapted Mixture of Experts (ES-MoE) approach which designs a causal-guided emotion decoupling block and a scenario-adapted expert constructing block to address the two challenges, respectively. Especially, this paper constructs multiple L^2-EMG datasets to validate the effectiveness of the ES-MoE approach. Extensive evaluations show that ES-MoE outperforms advanced baselines."}

However, current CRPS ensemble approaches vary in their training strategies and noise injection mechanisms, with most injecting noise globally throughout the network via conditional normalization. This structure increases training expense and limits the physical interpretability of the stochastic perturbations. We introduce Stochastic Decomposition Layers (SDL) for converting deterministic machine learning weather models into probabilistic ensemble systems. Adapted from StyleGAN's hierarchical noise injection, SDL applies learned perturbations at three decoder scales through latent-driven modulation, per-pixel noise, and channel scaling. When applied to WXFormer via transfer learning, SDL requires less than 2\\% of the computational cost needed to train the baseline model. Each ensemble member is generated from a compact latent tensor (5 MB), enabling perfect reproducibility and post-inference spread adjustment through latent rescaling. Evaluation on 2022 ERA5 reanalysis shows ensembles with spread-skill ratios approaching unity and rank histograms that progressively flatten toward uniformity through medium-range forecasts, achieving calibration competitive with operational IFS-ENS. Multi-scale experiments reveal hierarchical uncertainty: coarse layers modulate synoptic patterns while fine layers control mesoscale variability. The explicit latent parameterization provides interpretable uncertainty quantification for operational forecasting and climate applications."}

Recent restoration agents, powered by vision-language models and large language models, offer promising restoration capabilities but suffer from significant efficiency bottlenecks due to reflection, rollback, and iterative tool searching. Moreover, their performance heavily depends on degradation recognition models that require extensive annotations for training, limiting their applicability in label-free environments. To address these limitations, we propose a policy optimization-based restoration framework that learns an lightweight agent to determine tool-calling sequences. The agent operates in a sequential decision process, selecting the most appropriate restoration operation at each step to maximize final image quality. To enable training within label-free environments, we introduce a novel reward mechanism driven by multimodal large language models, which act as human-aligned evaluator and provide perceptual feedback for policy improvement. Once trained, our agent executes a deterministic restoration plans without redundant tool invocations, significantly accelerating inference while maintaining high restoration quality. Extensive experiments show that despite using no supervision, our method matches SOTA performance on full-reference metrics and surpasses existing approaches on no-reference metrics across diverse degradation scenarios."}

The current standard for evaluating this capability is MedCalc-Bench, a large-scale dataset constructed using LLM-based feature extraction and rule-based aggregation. However, treating such model-generated benchmarks as static oracles risks enshrining historical model errors as evaluation gold standards, a problem dangerously amplified when these datasets serve as reward signals for Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this work, we propose viewing benchmarks for complex tasks such as clinical score computation as ''in-progress living documents'' that should be periodically re-evaluated as the processes for creating them improve. We introduce a systematic, physician-in-the-loop pipeline that leverages advanced agentic verifiers to audit and relabel MedCalc-Bench, utilizing automated triage to reserve scarce clinician attention for the most contentious instances. Our audit reveals that a notable fraction of original labels diverge from medical ground truth due to extraction errors, calculator logic mismatches, and clinical ambiguity. To study whether this label noise meaningfully impacts downstream RL training, we fine-tune a Qwen3-8B model via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and demonstrate that training on corrected labels yields an 8.7% absolute improvement in accuracy over the original baseline -- validating that label noise materially affects model evaluation.

Recent efforts, such as AniSora, demonstrate promising performance by fine-tuning image-to-video models for animation styles, yet analogous exploration in the text-to-video setting remains limited.\n  In this work, we present PTTA, a pure text-to-animation framework for high-quality animation creation. We first construct a small-scale but high-quality paired dataset of animation videos and textual descriptions. Building upon the pretrained text-to-video model HunyuanVideo, we perform fine-tuning to adapt it to animation-style generation. Extensive visual evaluations across multiple dimensions show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms comparable baselines in animation video synthesis."}

In addition, its environment lacks key application categories, such as e-commerce and enterprise communication, and does not reflect realistic mobile-use scenarios characterized by vague user instructions and hybrid tool usage. To bridge this gap, we introduce MobileWorld, a substantially more challenging benchmark designed to better reflect real-world mobile usage, comprising 201 tasks across 20 applications, while maintaining the same level of reproducible evaluation as AndroidWorld. The difficulty of MobileWorld is twofold. First, it emphasizes long-horizon tasks with cross-application interactions: MobileWorld requires nearly twice as many task-completion steps on average (27.8 vs. 14.3) and includes far more multi-application tasks (62.2% vs. 9.5%) compared to AndroidWorld. Second, MobileWorld extends beyond standard GUI manipulation by introducing novel task categories, including agent-user interaction and MCP-augmented tasks. To ensure robust evaluation, we provide snapshot-based container environment and precise functional verifications, including backend database inspection and task callback APIs. We further develop a planner-executor agentic framework with extended action spaces to support user interactions and MCP calls. Our results reveal a sharp performance drop compared to AndroidWorld, with the best agentic framework and end-to-end model achieving 51.7% and 20.9% success rates, respectively. Our analysis shows that current models struggle significantly with user interaction and MCP calls, offering a strategic roadmap toward more robust, next-generation mobile intelligence."}

For Reasoning Multimodal Large Language Models (RMLLMs), this is uniquely challenging: intermediate chain-of-thought steps can still leak sensitive information even when final answers are forgotten, and overly aggressive interventions easily damage general reasoning ability. Yet no benchmark jointly evaluates how well unlearning methods suppress reasoning-level leakage while preserving reasoning competence. We address this gap with RMLLMU-Bench, the first benchmark for RMLLM unlearning that extends standard forgetting metrics with dedicated measures of reasoning leakage and reasoning retention. A systematic evaluation on RMLLMU-Bench reveals that existing unlearning methods for MLLMs and Large (Language) Reasoning Models (LRMs) either leave substantial leakage in the reasoning process or severely degrade reasoning performance. To address these gaps, we propose R-MUSE (Reasoning-preserving MLLM Unlearning via Subspace guidance and Adaptive Steering), a training-free and inference-time intervention framework that steers internal representations to forget both answers and reasoning traces while explicitly preserving general reasoning. Experiments on RMLLMU-Bench demonstrate that R-MUSE achieves a substantially better balance between effective forgetting and reasoning retention."}

Extensive experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in generation fidelity, editing consistency, and style transfer quality while maintaining low computational overhead and strong scalability to additional modalities.

A central challenge in this setting is question answering, which requires jointly leveraging unstructured text and the structured relational signals within the graph. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant advances in natural language understanding, their direct use for reasoning over text-attributed graphs remains limited. Retrieval-augmented generation methods that operate purely on text often treat passages as isolated units, ignoring the interconnected structure of the graph. Conversely, graph-based RAG methods that serialize large subgraphs into long textual sequences quickly become infeasible due to LLM context-length constraints, resulting in fragmented reasoning and degraded accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Graph-O1, an agentic GraphRAG framework that enables LLMs to conduct stepwise, interactive reasoning over graphs. Our approach integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with end-to-end reinforcement learning, allowing the model to selectively explore and retrieve only the most informative subgraph components. The reasoning procedure is framed as a multi-turn interaction between the agent and the graph environment, and the agent is trained through a unified reward mechanism. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM backbones demonstrate that Graph-O1 consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, producing answers that are more accurate, reliable, and interpretable."}

Unlike traditional supervised classification, ZSL typically relies on learning a mapping from visual features to predefined, human-understandable class concepts. While ZSL models promise to improve generalization and interpretability, their robustness under systematic input perturbations remain unclear. In this study, we present an empirical analysis about the robustness of existing ZSL methods at both classlevel and concept-level. Specifically, we successfully disrupted their class prediction by the well-known non-target class attack (clsA). However, in the Generalized Zero-shot Learning (GZSL) setting, we observe that the success of clsA is only at the original best-calibrated point. After the attack, the optimal bestcalibration point shifts, and ZSL models maintain relatively strong performance at other calibration points, indicating that clsA results in a spurious attack success in the GZSL. To address this, we propose the Class-Bias Enhanced Attack (CBEA), which completely eliminates GZSL accuracy across all calibrated points by enhancing the gap between seen and unseen class probabilities.Next, at concept-level attack, we introduce two novel attack modes: Class-Preserving Concept Attack (CPconA) and NonClass-Preserving Concept Attack (NCPconA). Our extensive experiments evaluate three typical ZSL models across various architectures from the past three years and reveal that ZSL models are vulnerable not only to the traditional class attack but also to concept-based attacks. These attacks allow malicious actors to easily manipulate class predictions by erasing or introducing concepts. Our findings highlight a significant performance gap between existing approaches, emphasizing the need for improved adversarial robustness in current ZSL models."}

We systematically investigate the interplay between quantization precision (FP16, INT8, INT4) and replay buffer strategies in large language models, revealing unexpected dynamics. While FP16 achieves superior initial task performance (74.44% on NLU), we observe a striking inversion on subsequent tasks: quantized models outperform FP16 by 8-15% on final task forward accuracy, with INT4 achieving nearly double FP16's performance on Code generation (40% vs 20%). Critically, even minimal replay buffers (0.1%) dramatically improve retention - increasing NLU retention after Math training from 45% to 65% across all precision levels - with INT8 consistently achieving the optimal balance between learning plasticity and knowledge retention. We hypothesize that quantization-induced noise acts as implicit regularization, preventing the overfitting to new task gradients that plagues high-precision models. These findings challenge the conventional wisdom that higher precision is always preferable, suggesting instead that INT8 quantization offers both computational efficiency and superior continual learning dynamics. Our results provide practical guidelines for deploying compressed models in continual learning scenarios: small replay buffers (1-2%) suffice for NLU tasks, while Math and Code benefit from moderate buffers (5-10%), with quantized models requiring less replay than FP16 to achieve comparable retention.

On the appearance side, illumination consistency leverages frequency priors to enable controllable and cross-view coherent lighting, while an appearance refinement module further separates illumination, material, and view-dependent cues to recover fine texture. To tackle the lack of large-scale geometrically consistent paired data, we synthesize dark views via a physics-based camera model for training.

Accurate prediction of LC mortality rates is crucial for guiding targeted interventions and addressing health disparities. Although traditional regression-based models have been commonly used, explainable machine learning models may offer enhanced predictive accuracy and deeper insights into the factors influencing LC mortality. This study applied three models: random forest (RF), gradient boosting regression (GBR), and linear regression (LR) to predict county-level LC mortality rates across the United States. Model performance was evaluated using R-squared and root mean squared error (RMSE). Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values were used to determine variable importance and their directional impact. Geographic disparities in LC mortality were analyzed through Getis-Ord (Gi*) hotspot analysis. The RF model outperformed both GBR and LR, achieving an R2 value of 41.9% and an RMSE of 12.8. SHAP analysis identified smoking rate as the most important predictor, followed by median home value and the percentage of the Hispanic ethnic population. Spatial analysis revealed significant clusters of elevated LC mortality in the mid-eastern counties of the United States. The RF model demonstrated superior predictive performance for LC mortality rates, emphasizing the critical roles of smoking prevalence, housing values, and the percentage of Hispanic ethnic population. These findings offer valuable actionable insights for designing targeted interventions, promoting screening, and addressing health disparities in regions most affected by LC in the United States."}

While several methods for hallucination mitigation have been proposed, they often compromise the model's capacity for video understanding and reasoning. In this work, we propose SmartSight, a pioneering step to address this issue in a training-free manner by leveraging the model's own introspective capabilities. Specifically, SmartSight generates multiple candidate responses to uncover low-hallucinated outputs that are often obscured by standard greedy decoding. It assesses the hallucination of each response using the Temporal Attention Collapse score, which measures whether the model over-focuses on trivial temporal regions of the input video when generating the response. To improve efficiency, SmartSight identifies the Visual Attention Vanishing point, enabling more accurate hallucination estimation and early termination of hallucinated responses, leading to a substantial reduction in decoding cost. Experiments show that SmartSight substantially lowers hallucinations for Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 10.59% on VRIPT-HAL, while simultaneously enhancing video understanding and reasoning, boosting performance on VideoMMMU by up to 8.86%. These results highlight SmartSight's effectiveness in improving the reliability of open-source Video-LLMs."}

Our goal is to provide an informative, balanced comparison framework that considers both performance outcomes and computational cost. Among our findings, we discovered that simply increasing the thinking budget is not the most effective use of compute.

We overcome these limitations by proposing an online DR-RL algorithm with general function approximation that learns an optimal robust policy purely through interaction with the environment, without requiring prior models or offline data, enabling deployment in high-dimensional tasks. We further provide a theoretical analysis establishing a near-optimal sublinear regret bound under a total variation uncertainty set, demonstrating the sample efficiency and effectiveness of our method."}

A lightweight timestep prediction module (TPM), trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), selects a more feasible conditioning timestep based on the current state, effectively choosing a desired noise level to control image detail and textural richness. At deployment, a scaling hyper-parameter can be used to interpolate between the original and de-synchronized timesteps, enabling conservative or aggressive adjustments.

We introduce a direct, first-principles framework for constructing discrete-time SSMs that is both flexible and modular. Our approach is based on a novel lag operator, which geometrically derives the discrete-time recurrence by measuring how the system's basis functions \"slide\" and change from one timestep to the next. The resulting state matrices are computed via a single inner product involving this operator, offering a modular design space for creating novel SSMs by flexibly combining different basis functions and time-warping schemes. To validate our approach, we demonstrate that a specific instance exactly recovers the recurrence of the influential HiPPO model.

First, a few labeled outliers are leveraged to construct label-informed fuzzy similarity relations. Next, the consistency of the fuzzy decision system is introduced to evaluate attributes' contributions to knowledge classification. Subsequently, we define the outlier factor based on the fuzzy similarity class and predict outliers by integrating the classification consistency and the outlier factor. The proposed algorithm is extensively evaluated on 15 freshly proposed datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that COD is better than or comparable with the leading outlier detectors.

The core insight is that general-purpose attention between patches learns temporal and spatial information for geometric reasoning. We demonstrate that appending a linear decoder to the Transformer backbone produces satisfactory results, and iterative refinement can further elevate performance to stateof-the-art levels. This conceptually simple approach achieves top cross-dataset generalization results for optical flow estimation with end-point error (EPE) of 0.69, 1.78, and 3.15 on the Sintel clean, Sintel final, and KITTI datasets, respectively.

Specifically, we first utilize a small subset of labeled data to construct fuzzy decision systems, through which we introduce the attribute classification accuracy based on fuzzy approximations to evaluate the contribution of attribute sets in outlier detection. Unlabeled data is then used to compute fuzzy relative entropy, which provides a characterization of outliers from the perspective of uncertainty.

To address this, we propose EcoSplat, the first efficiency-controllable feed-forward 3DGS framework that adaptively predicts the 3D representation for any given target primitive count at inference time. EcoSplat adopts a two-stage optimization process. The first stage is Pixel-aligned Gaussian Training (PGT) where our model learns initial primitive prediction. The second stage is Importance-aware Gaussian Finetuning (IGF) stage where our model learns rank primitives and adaptively adjust their parameters based on the target primitive count. Extensive experiments across multiple dense-view settings show that EcoSplat is robust and outperforms state-of-the-art methods under strict primitive-count constraints, making it well-suited for flexible downstream rendering tasks."}

This papers investigates parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, specifically Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Quantized LoRA, as scalable alternatives to full model fine-tuning for HAR. We propose an adaptation framework built upon a Masked Autoencoder backbone and evaluate its performance under a Leave-One-Dataset-Out validation protocol across five open HAR datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that both LoRA and QLoRA can match the recognition performance of full fine-tuning while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters, memory usage, and training time. Further analyses reveal that LoRA maintains robust performance even under limited supervision and that the adapter rank provides a controllable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. QLoRA extends these benefits by reducing the memory footprint of frozen weights through quantization, with minimal impact on classification quality."}

Most existing methods use Gaussian processes (GP) as the surrogate model for approximating the black-box objective function, it is well-known that it can fail in high-dimensional space (e.g., dimension over 500). We argue that the reliance of GP on precise numerical fitting is fundamentally ill-suited in high-dimensional space, where it leads to prohibitive computational complexity. In order to address this, we propose a simple order-preserving Bayesian optimization (OPBO) method, where the surrogate model preserves the order, instead of the value, of the black-box objective function. Then we can use a simple but effective OP neural network (NN) to replace GP as the surrogate model. Moreover, instead of searching for the best solution from the acquisition model, we select good-enough solutions in the ordinal set to reduce computational cost. The experimental results show that for high-dimensional (over 500) black-box optimization problems, the proposed OPBO significantly outperforms traditional BO methods based on regression NN and GP.

Recent remarkable advancements in deep learning have undeniably brought about substantial performance improvements in these fields. Nevertheless, existing methods mainly rely on task-specific architectures. This significantly restricts their generalization ability and effective application across a wide range of different tasks. In this paper, we introduce the Unified Rectification Framework (UniRect), a comprehensive approach that addresses these practical tasks from a consistent distortion rectification perspective. Our approach incorporates various task-specific inverse problems into a general distortion model by simulating different types of lenses. To handle diverse distortions, UniRect adopts one task-agnostic rectification framework with a dual-component structure: a {Deformation Module}, which utilizes a novel Residual Progressive Thin-Plate Spline (RP-TPS) model to address complex geometric deformations, and a subsequent Restoration Module, which employs Residual Mamba Blocks (RMBs) to counteract the degradation caused by the deformation process and enhance the fidelity of the output image. Moreover, a Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoEs) structure is designed to circumvent heavy task competition in multi-task learning due to varying distortions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our models have achieved state-of-the-art performance compared with other up-to-date methods."}

Unlike traditional methods that evolve models on static datasets, GenEnv instantiates a dataevolving: the simulator acts as a dynamic curriculum policy, continuously generating tasks specifically tailored to the agent's ``zone of proximal development''. This process is guided by a simple but effective $α$-Curriculum Reward, which aligns task difficulty with the agent's current capabilities.

We introduce R-GenIMA, an interpretable multimodal large language model that couples a novel ROI-wise vision transformer with genetic prompting to jointly model structural MRI and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) variations. By representing each anatomically parcellated brain region as a visual token and encoding SNP profiles as structured text, the framework enables cross-modal attention that links regional atrophy patterns to underlying genetic factors. Applied to the ADNI cohort, R-GenIMA achieves state-of-the-art performance in four-way classification across normal cognition (NC), subjective memory concerns (SMC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD.

Attention-based attribution revealed genes consistently enriched for established GWAS-supported AD risk loci, including APOE, BIN1, CLU, and RBFOX1. Stage-resolved neuroanatomical signatures identified shared vulnerability hubs across disease stages alongside stage-specific patterns: striatal involvement in subjective decline, frontotemporal engagement during prodromal impairment, and consolidated multimodal network disruption in AD.

Prior work shows that these optimizers exhibit distinct stability dynamics: full-batch methods train at the Edge of Stability (EoS), while mini-batch and adaptive methods exhibit analogous edge-of-stability behavior. At these regimes, the training loss and the sharpness--the maximum eigenvalue of the training loss Hessian--exhibit certain characteristic behavior. In DP training, per-example gradient clipping and Gaussian noise modify the update rule, and it is unclear whether these stability patterns persist. We analyze how clipping and noise change sharpness and loss evolution and show that while DP generally reduces the sharpness and can prevent optimizers from fully reaching the classical stability thresholds, patterns from EoS and analogous adaptive methods stability regimes persist, with the largest learning rates and largest privacy budgets approaching, and sometimes exceeding, these thresholds.

To address this training efficiency-stability trade-off, we introduce $\\textbf{MSSR}$ (Multimodal Stabilized Single-Rollout), a group-free RLVR framework that achieves both stable optimization and effective multimodal reasoning performance. MSSR achieves this via an entropy-based advantage-shaping mechanism that adaptively regularizes advantage magnitudes, preventing collapse and maintaining training stability. While such mechanisms have been used in group-based RLVR, we show that in the multimodal single-rollout setting they are not merely beneficial but essential for stability. In in-distribution evaluations, MSSR demonstrates superior training compute efficiency, achieving similar validation accuracy to the group-based baseline with half the training steps. When trained for the same number of steps, MSSR's performance surpasses the group-based baseline and shows consistent generalization improvements across five diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks.

In the original framework, each ML-generated candidate model is embedded in a CFD solver and evaluated against reference data, requiring hundreds to thousands of high-fidelity simulations and resulting in prohibitive computational cost for complex flows. To overcome this limitation, we propose an extended framework that integrates surrogate modeling into symbolic CFD-driven training in real time to reduce training cost. The surrogate model learns to approximate the errors of ML-generated models based on previous CFD evaluations and is continuously refined during training. Newly generated models are first assessed using the surrogate, and only those predicted to yield small errors or high uncertainty are subsequently evaluated with full CFD simulations. Discrete expressions generated by symbolic regression are mapped into a continuous space using averaged input-symbol values as inputs to a probabilistic surrogate model. To support multi-objective model training, particularly when fixed weighting of competing quantities is challenging, the surrogate is extended to a multi-output formulation by generalizing the kernel to a matrix form, providing one mean and variance prediction per training objective. Selection metrics based on these probabilistic outputs are used to identify an optimal training setup. The proposed surrogate-augmented CFD-driven training framework is demonstrated across a range of statistically one- and two-dimensional flows, including both single- and multi-expression model optimization. In all cases, the framework substantially reduces training cost while maintaining predictive accuracy comparable to that of the original CFD-driven approach."}

Investigation of training dataset annotation guidelines from PixMo and Visual Genome reveals no explicit left-first ordering instructions, suggesting the bias is consistent with architectural factors rather than explicit training data instructions. These findings reveal fundamental limitations in how current VLMs process spatial information."}

We present FOODER, a real-time, privacy-preserving radar-based framework that integrates OOD-based facial authentication with facial expression recognition. FOODER operates using low-cost frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar and exploits both range-Doppler and micro range-Doppler representations. The authentication module employs a multi-encoder multi-decoder architecture with Body Part (BP) and Intermediate Linear Encoder-Decoder (ILED) components to classify a single enrolled individual as in-distribution while detecting all other faces as OOD. Upon successful authentication, an expression recognition module is activated. Concatenated radar representations are processed by a ResNet block to distinguish between dynamic and static facial expressions. Based on this categorization, two specialized MobileViT networks are used to classify dynamic expressions (smile, shock) and static expressions (neutral, anger). This hierarchical design enables robust facial authentication and fine-grained expression recognition while preserving user privacy by relying exclusively on radar data. Experiments conducted on a dataset collected with a 60 GHz short-range FMCW radar demonstrate that FOODER achieves an AUROC of 94.13% and an FPR95 of 18.12% for authentication, along with an average expression recognition accuracy of 94.70%. FOODER outperforms state-of-the-art OOD detection methods and several transformer-based architectures while operating efficiently in real time."}

To maintain a comfortable indoor environment and minimize the contribution of the building to climate change as much as possible, higher requirements are placed on the operation and control of HVAC systems, e.g., more energy-efficient and flexible to response to the rapid change of weather. This places demands on the rapid modeling and prediction of zone air temperatures of buildings. Compared to the traditional simulation-based approach such as EnergyPlus and DOE2, a hybrid approach combined physics and data-driven is more suitable. Recently, the availability of high-quality datasets and algorithmic breakthroughs have driven a considerable amount of work in this field. However, in the niche of short- and long-term predictions, there are still some gaps in existing research. This paper aims to develop a time series forecast model to predict the zone air temperature in a building located in America on a 2-week horizon. The findings could be further improved to support intelligent control and operation of HVAC systems (i.e. demand flexibility) and could also be used as hybrid building energy modeling."}

To meet these challenges, we propose IPCV, a training-free, information-preserving compression framework for MLLM visual encoders. IPCV enables aggressive token pruning inside the ViT via Neighbor-Guided Reconstruction (NGR) that temporarily reconstructs pruned tokens to participate in attention with minimal overhead, then fully restores them before passing to the LLM. Besides, we introduce Attention Stabilization (AS) to further alleviate the negative influence from token pruning by approximating the K/V of pruned tokens.

However, as organized crime groups are becoming more professional in real-world scenarios, fraudsters are employing more sophisticated camouflage strategies. Specifically, fraudsters disguise themselves by mimicking the behavioral data collected by platforms, ensuring that their key characteristics are consistent with those of benign users to a high degree, which we call Adaptive Camouflage. Consequently, this narrows the differences in behavioral traits between them and benign users within the platform's database, thereby making current GFD models lose efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a relation diffusion-based graph augmentation model Grad. In detail, Grad leverages a supervised graph contrastive learning module to enhance the fraud-benign difference and employs a guided relation diffusion generator to generate auxiliary homophilic relations from scratch. Based on these, weak fraudulent signals would be enhanced during the aggregation process, thus being obvious enough to be captured. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two real-world datasets provided by WeChat Pay, one of the largest online payment platforms with billions of users, and three public datasets.

Traditional detection methods that rely solely on high-confidence identity links suffer from limited coverage, while approaches using all available linkages often result in fragmented graphs with reduced clustering effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based fraud detection framework that addresses the challenge of large-scale heterogeneous graph clustering through a principled link transformation approach. Our method distinguishes between \\emph{hard links} (high-confidence identity relationships such as phone numbers, credit cards, and national IDs) and \\emph{soft links} (behavioral associations including device fingerprints, cookies, and IP addresses). We introduce a graph transformation technique that first identifies connected components via hard links, merges them into super-nodes, and then reconstructs a weighted soft-link graph amenable to efficient embedding and clustering. The transformed graph is processed using LINE (Large-scale Information Network Embedding) for representation learning, followed by HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) for density-based cluster discovery. Experiments on a real-world payment platform dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves significant graph size reduction (from 25 million to 7.7 million nodes), doubles the detection coverage compared to hard-link-only baselines, and maintains high precision across identified fraud clusters. Our framework provides a scalable and practical solution for industrial-scale fraud detection systems."}

The Generalized Resolution--Shell Dynamics (GRSD) framework models learning as spectral energy transport across logarithmic resolution shells, providing a coarse--grained dynamical description of training. Within GRSD, power--law scaling corresponds to a particularly simple renormalized shell dynamics; however, such behavior is not automatic and requires additional structural properties of the learning process.\n  In this work, we identify a set of sufficient conditions under which the GRSD shell dynamics admits a renormalizable coarse--grained description. These conditions constrain the learning configuration at multiple levels, including boundedness of gradient propagation in the computation graph, weak functional incoherence at initialization, controlled Jacobian evolution along training, and log--shift invariance of renormalized shell couplings. We further show that power--law scaling does not follow from renormalizability alone, but instead arises as a rigidity consequence: once log--shift invariance is combined with the intrinsic time--rescaling covariance of gradient flow, the renormalized GRSD velocity field is forced into a power--law form."}

Recently, several methods have been proposed to alleviate LVLM hallucinations, but most focus solely on reducing hallucinations in the language modality. To mitigate hallucinations in both the language and visual modalities, we introduce Hallucination Disentangled Decoding (HDD) method that requires no training. HDD enhances the original image by segmenting it and selecting images that augment the original, while also utilizing a blank image to eliminate language prior hallucinations in both the original and segmented images.

To address this training efficiency-stability trade-off, we introduce $\\textbf{MSSR}$ (Multimodal Stabilized Single-Rollout), a group-free RLVR framework that achieves both stable optimization and effective multimodal reasoning performance. MSSR achieves this via an entropy-based advantage-shaping mechanism that adaptively regularizes advantage magnitudes, preventing collapse and maintaining training stability. While such mechanisms have been used in group-based RLVR, we show that in the multimodal single-rollout setting they are not merely beneficial but essential for stability. In in-distribution evaluations, MSSR demonstrates superior training compute efficiency, achieving similar validation accuracy to the group-based baseline with half the training steps. When trained for the same number of steps, MSSR's performance surpasses the group-based baseline and shows consistent generalization improvements across five diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks. Together, these results demonstrate that MSSR enables stable, compute-efficient, and effective RLVR for complex multimodal reasoning tasks."}

To overcome this, we propose a Masked 3D Attention mechanism that constrains the attention pattern to enforce temporal alignment, enabling stable training and superior performance.

A core objective of model merging is to ensure the merged model retains the behavioural characteristics of the specialised models, typically achieved through feature alignment. We identify that features consist of two critical components: direction and magnitude. Prior research has predominantly focused on directional alignment, while the influence of magnitude remains largely neglected, despite its pronounced vulnerability to perturbations introduced by common merging operations (e.g., parameter fusion and sparsification). Such perturbations to magnitude inevitably lead to feature deviations in the merged model from the specialised models, resulting in subsequent performance degradation. To address this, we propose MAGnItude Calibration (MAGIC), a plug-and-play framework that rectifies layer-wise magnitudes in feature and weight spaces, with three variants. Specifically, our Feature Space Calibration (FSC) realigns the merged model's features using a small set of unlabelled data, while Weight Space Calibration (WSC) extends this calibration to the weight space without requiring additional data. Combining these yields Dual Space Calibration (DSC). Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MAGIC consistently boosts performance across diverse Computer Vision tasks (+4.3% on eight datasets) and NLP tasks (+8.0% on Llama) without additional training.

However, object detection in hyperspectral images faces significant challenges in intra- and inter-class similarity due to the spatial differences in hyperspectral inter-bands and unavoidable interferences, e.g., sensor noises and illumination. To alleviate the hyperspectral inter-bands inconsistencies and redundancy, we propose a novel network termed \\textbf{S}pectral \\textbf{D}iscrepancy and \\textbf{C}ross-\\textbf{M}odal semantic consistency learning (SDCM), which facilitates the extraction of consistent information across a wide range of hyperspectral bands while utilizing the spectral dimension to pinpoint regions of interest. Specifically, we leverage a semantic consistency learning (SCL) module that utilizes inter-band contextual cues to diminish the heterogeneity of information among bands, yielding highly coherent spectral dimension representations. On the other hand, we incorporate a spectral gated generator (SGG) into the framework that filters out the redundant data inherent in hyperspectral information based on the importance of the bands. Then, we design the spectral discrepancy aware (SDA) module to enrich the semantic representation of high-level information by extracting pixel-level spectral features. Extensive experiments on two hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance when compared with other ones."}

Under OAC-FL, every client modulates its intermediate parameters, such as gradient, onto the same set of orthogonal waveforms and simultaneously transmits the radio signal to the edge server. By exploiting the superposition property of multiple-access channels, the edge server can obtain an automatically aggregated global gradient from the received signal. However, the limited number of orthogonal waveforms available in practical systems is fundamentally mismatched with the high dimensionality of modern deep learning models. To address this issue, we propose Freshness Freshness-mAgnItude awaRe top-k (FAIR-k), an algorithm that selects, in each communication round, the most impactful subset of gradients to be updated over the air. In essence, FAIR-k combines the complementary strengths of the Round-Robin and Top-k algorithms, striking a delicate balance between timeliness (freshness of parameter updates) and importance (gradient magnitude). Leveraging tools from Markov analysis, we characterize the distribution of parameter staleness under FAIR-k. Building on this, we establish the convergence rate of OAC-FL with FAIR-k, which discloses the joint effect of data heterogeneity, channel noise, and parameter staleness on the training efficiency. Notably, as opposed to conventional analyses that assume a universal Lipschitz constant across all the clients, our framework adopts a finer-grained model of the data heterogeneity. The analysis demonstrates that since FAIR-k promotes fresh (and fair) parameter updates, it not only accelerates convergence but also enhances communication efficiency by enabling an extended period of local training without significantly affecting overall training efficiency."}

Understanding how policy evolves across layers and modules is therefore crucial for enabling more targeted optimization and raveling out complex reasoning mechanisms. In this paper, we decompose the language model policy by leveraging the intrinsic split of the Transformer residual stream and the equivalence between the composition of hidden states with the unembedding matrix and the resulting samplable policy. This decomposition reveals Internal Layer Policies, corresponding to contributions from individual layers, and Internal Modular Policies, which align with the self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN) components within each layer. By analyzing the entropy of internal policy, we find that: (a) Early layers keep high entropy for exploration, top layers converge to near-zero entropy for refinement, with convergence patterns varying across model series. (b) LLama's prediction space rapidly converges in the final layer, whereas Qwen-series models, especially Qwen3, exhibit a more human-like, progressively structured reasoning pattern. Motivated by these findings, we propose Bottom-up Policy Optimization (BuPO), a novel RL paradigm that directly optimizes the internal layer policy during early training. By aligning training objective at lower layer, BuPO reconstructs foundational reasoning capabilities and achieves superior performance. Extensive experiments on complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/Trae1ounG/BuPO."}

In this paper, we uncover the striking data saturation in offline behavioral data: policy performance rapidly saturates when trained on a small fraction of the dataset. We attribute this effect to the weak alignment between policy performance and test loss, revealing substantial room for improvement through data selection. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective method, Stepwise Dual Ranking (SDR), which extracts a compact yet informative subset from large-scale offline behavioral datasets. SDR is build on two key principles: (1) stepwise clip, which prioritizes early-stage data; and (2) dual ranking, which selects samples with both high action-value rank and low state-density rank. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that SDR significantly enhances data selection for offline behavioral data."}

However, existing methods struggle to address small-sample scenarios caused by cold start, load distortion, multi-source data fragmentation, and distribution shifts in green data centers. We introduce HyperLoad, a cross-modality framework that exploits pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to overcome data scarcity. In the Cross-Modality Knowledge Alignment phase, textual priors and time-series data are mapped to a common latent space, maximizing the utility of prior knowledge. In the Multi-Scale Feature Modeling phase, domain-aligned priors are injected through adaptive prefix-tuning, enabling rapid scenario adaptation, while an Enhanced Global Interaction Attention mechanism captures cross-device temporal dependencies. The public DCData dataset is released for benchmarking. Under both data sufficient and data scarce settings, HyperLoad consistently surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, demonstrating its practicality for sustainable green data center management."}

While existing methods often rely on additional genre labels to further improve dance generation, such labels are typically noisy, coarse, unavailable, or insufficient to capture the diversity of real-world music, which can result in rhythm misalignment or stylistic drift. In contrast, we observe that tempo, a core property reflecting musical rhythm and pace, remains relatively consistent across datasets and genres, typically ranging from 60 to 200 BPM. Based on this finding, we propose TempoMoE, a hierarchical tempo-aware Mixture-of-Experts module that enhances the diffusion model and its rhythm perception. TempoMoE organizes motion experts into tempo-structured groups for different tempo ranges, with multi-scale beat experts capturing fine- and long-range rhythmic dynamics. A Hierarchical Rhythm-Adaptive Routing dynamically selects and fuses experts from music features, enabling flexible, rhythm-aligned generation without manual genre labels.

Seeds, as important archaeological artifacts, represent a fundamental subject of archaeobotanical research. However, traditional studies rely heavily on expert knowledge, which is often time-consuming and inefficient. Intelligent analysis methods have made progress in various fields of archaeology, but there remains a research gap in data and methods in archaeobotany, especially in the classification task of ancient plant seeds. To address this, we construct the first Ancient Plant Seed Image Classification (APS) dataset. It contains 8,340 images from 17 genus- or species-level seed categories excavated from 18 archaeological sites across China. In addition, we design a framework specifically for the ancient plant seed classification task (APSNet), which introduces the scale feature (size) of seeds based on learning fine-grained information to guide the network in discovering key \"evidence\" for sufficient classification. Specifically, we design a Size Perception and Embedding (SPE) module in the encoder part to explicitly extract size information for the purpose of complementing fine-grained information. We propose an Asynchronous Decoupled Decoding (ADD) architecture based on traditional progressive learning to decode features from both channel and spatial perspectives, enabling efficient learning of discriminative features. In both quantitative and qualitative analyses, our approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art image classification methods, achieving an accuracy of 90.5%.

Methods: Our CA architecture first processes the iEEG signal using state-of-the-art models applied to each single channel independently. The resulting features are then fused using a vector-symbolic algorithm which reconstructs the spatial relationship using a trainable scalar per channel. Finally, the fused features are accumulated in a long-term memory of up to 2 minutes to perform the classification. Each CA-model can then be pre-trained on a large corpus of iEEG recordings from multiple heterogeneous subjects. The pre-trained model is personalized to each subject via a quick fine-tuning routine, which uses equal or lower amounts of data compared to existing state-of-the-art models, but requiring only 1/5 of the time. Results: We evaluate our CA-models on a seizure detection task both on a short-term (~20 hours) and a long-term (~2500 hours) dataset. In particular, our CA-EEGWaveNet is trained on a single seizure of the tested subject, while the baseline EEGWaveNet is trained on all but one. Even in this challenging scenario, our CA-EEGWaveNet surpasses the baseline in median F1-score (0.78 vs 0.76). Similarly, CA-EEGNet based on EEGNet, also surpasses its baseline in median F1-score (0.79 vs 0.74). Conclusion and significance: Our CA-model addresses two issues: first, it is channel-adaptive and can therefore be trained across heterogeneous subjects without loss of performance; second, it increases the effective temporal context size to a clinically-relevant length. Therefore, our model is a drop-in replacement for existing models, bringing better characteristics and performance across the board."}

To address this challenge, we propose a novel protection method that jointly optimizes privacy suppression and utility preservation under a visual consistency constraint. While our method is conceptually effective, fair comparisons between methods remain challenging due to the lack of publicly available evaluation datasets. To fill this gap, we introduce VPI-COCO, a publicly available benchmark comprising 522 images with hierarchically structured privacy questions and corresponding non-private counterparts, enabling fine-grained and joint evaluation of protection methods in terms of privacy preservation and user experience. Building upon this benchmark, experiments on multiple VLMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces PAR below 25%, keeps NPAR above 88%, maintains high visual consistency, and generalizes well to unseen and paraphrased privacy questions, demonstrating its strong practical applicability for real-world VLM deployments."}

Nevertheless, the existing industrial hybrid modeling methods still face two main limitations. First, current research has mainly focused on applying a single machine learning method to one specific task, failing to develop a comprehensive machine learning architecture suitable for modeling tasks, which limits their ability to effectively represent complex industrial scenarios. Second, industrial datasets often contain underlying associations (e.g., monotonicity or periodicity) that are not adequately exploited by current research, which can degrade model's predictive performance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the Recurrent Perceptron-based Channel Attention Transformer Encoder (RP-CATE), with three distinctive characteristics: 1: We developed a novel architecture by replacing the self-attention mechanism with channel attention and incorporating our proposed Recurrent Perceptron (RP) Module into Transformer, achieving enhanced effectiveness for industrial modeling tasks compared to the original Transformer. 2: We proposed a new data type called Pseudo-Image Data (PID) tailored for channel attention requirements and developed a cyclic sliding window method for generating PID. 3: We introduced the concept of Pseudo-Sequential Data (PSD) and a method for converting industrial datasets into PSD, which enables the RP Module to capture the underlying associations within industrial dataset more effectively.

To address this, we introduce EchoMotion, a framework designed to model the joint distribution of appearance and human motion, thereby improving the quality of complex human action video generation. EchoMotion extends the DiT (Diffusion Transformer) framework with a dual-branch architecture that jointly processes tokens concatenated from different modalities. Furthermore, we propose MVS-RoPE (Motion-Video Syncronized RoPE), which offers unified 3D positional encoding for both video and motion tokens. By providing a synchronized coordinate system for the dual-modal latent sequence, MVS-RoPE establishes an inductive bias that fosters temporal alignment between the two modalities. We also propose a Motion-Video Two-Stage Training Strategy. This strategy enables the model to perform both the joint generation of complex human action videos and their corresponding motion sequences, as well as versatile cross-modal conditional generation tasks. To facilitate the training of a model with these capabilities, we construct HuMoVe, a large-scale dataset of approximately 80,000 high-quality, human-centric video-motion pairs.

A key challenge experienced in these more realistic domains is highly non-Markovian dependencies with respect to the agent's observations, which are less common in small controlled domains. The predominant approach for dealing with this in the literature is to stack together a window of the most recent observations (Frame Stacking), but this window size must grow with the degree of non-Markovian dependencies, which results in prohibitive computational and memory requirements for both action inference and learning. In this paper, we are motivated by the insight that in many environments that are highly non-Markovian with respect to time, the environment only causally depends on a relatively small number of observations over that time-scale. A natural direction would then be to consider meta-algorithms that maintain relatively small adaptive stacks of memories such that it is possible to express highly non-Markovian dependencies with respect to time while considering fewer observations at each step and thus experience substantial savings in both compute and memory requirements. Hence, we propose a meta-algorithm (Adaptive Stacking) for achieving exactly that with convergence guarantees and quantify the reduced computation and memory constraints for MLP, LSTM, and Transformer-based agents. Our experiments utilize popular memory tasks, which give us control over the degree of non-Markovian dependencies. This allows us to demonstrate that an appropriate meta-algorithm can learn the removal of memories not predictive of future rewards without excessive removal of important experiences.

To interpret the neural mechanism underlying thoughts, we propose a transformers-based framework to extract spatial-temporal representations associated with observed visual stimuli from EEG recordings. These features are subsequently incorporated into the attention mechanisms of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) to facilitate the reconstruction of visual stimuli from brain activity. The quantitative evaluations on publicly available benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method excels at modeling the semantic structures from EEG signals; achieving up to 6.5% increase in latent space clustering accuracy and 11.8% increase in zero shot generalization across unseen classes while having comparable Inception Score and Fréchet Inception Distance with existing baselines. Our work marks a significant step towards generalizable semantic interpretation of the EEG signals."}

An empirical evaluation across multiple compressor configurations shows that the learned policy is physically plausible, anticipates future demand, and consistently respects system boundaries. Compared to the installed industrial controller, the proposed approach reduces unnecessary overpressure and achieves energy savings of approximately 4\\,\\% without relying on explicit physics models. The results further indicate that system pressure and forecast information dominate policy decisions, while compressor-level inputs play a secondary role.

This neglects that the quantum and classical branches constitute distinct computational modalities and limits reliable performance on complex, high dimensional tabular and semi structured data, including remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and medical diagnostics. We present a multimodal formulation of hybrid learning and propose a cross attention mid fusion architecture in which a classical representation queries quantum derived feature tokens through an attention block with residual connectivity. The quantum branch is kept within practical NISQ budgets and uses up to nine qubits. We evaluate on Wine, Breast Cancer, Forest CoverType, FashionMNIST, and SteelPlatesFaults, comparing a quantum only model, a classical baseline, residual hybrid models, and the proposed mid fusion model under a consistent protocol. Pure quantum and standard hybrid designs underperform due to measurement induced information loss, while cross attention mid fusion is consistently competitive and improves performance on the more complex datasets in most cases. These findings suggest that quantum derived information becomes most valuable when integrated through principled multimodal fusion rather than used in isolation or loosely appended to classical features."}

Therefore, this study proposes the Multi-Channel Vegetation Indices Saturation Aware Net (MCVI-SANet), a lightweight semi-supervised vision model. The model incorporates a newly designed Vegetation Index Saturation-Aware Block (VI-SABlock) for adaptive channel-spatial feature enhancement. It also integrates a VICReg-based semi-supervised strategy to further improve generalization.

The model attains an average R2 of 0.8123 and RMSE of 0.4796 for LAI, and an average R2 of 0.6846 and RMSE of 2.4222 for SPAD. This performance surpasses the best-performing baselines, with improvements of 8.95% in average LAI R2 and 8.17% in average SPAD R2. Moreover, MCVI-SANet maintains high inference speed with only 0.10M parameters.

Crash video analysis is a challenging multitask problem due to the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of crash events in video data and the diverse analytical requirements involved. It requires capabilities spanning crash recognition, temporal grounding, and high-level video understanding. Existing models, however, cannot perform all these tasks within a unified framework, and effective training strategies for such models remain underexplored. To fill these gaps, this paper proposes CrashChat, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) for multitask traffic crash analysis, built upon VideoLLaMA3. CrashChat acquires domain-specific knowledge through instruction fine-tuning and employs a novel multitask learning strategy based on task decoupling and grouping, which maximizes the benefit of joint learning within and across task groups while mitigating negative transfer. Numerical experiments on consolidated public datasets demonstrate that CrashChat consistently outperforms existing MLLMs across model scales and traditional vision-based methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance. It reaches near-perfect accuracy in crash recognition, a 176\\% improvement in crash localization, and a 40\\% improvement in the more challenging pre-crash localization. Compared to general MLLMs, it substantially enhances textual accuracy and content coverage in crash description and reasoning tasks, with 0.18-0.41 increases in BLEU scores and 0.18-0.42 increases in ROUGE scores. Beyond its strong performance, CrashChat is a convenient, end-to-end analytical tool ready for practical implementation.

Fixed-precision quantization struggles to handle outlier channels in the key cache, while current mixed-precision strategies fail to accurately identify components requiring high-precision representation. We find that an effective low-bit KV cache quantization strategy must consider two factors: a key channel's intrinsic quantization difficulty and its relevance to the query. Based on this insight, we propose MixKVQ, a novel plug-and-play method that introduces a lightweight, query-aware algorithm to identify and preserve critical key channels that need higher precision, while applying per-token quantization for value cache.

These are spurious cues which are associated with output labels in the training data but are unrelated to task semantics. When the shortcut features are associated with sensitive attributes, shortcut learning can lead to biased model performance. Existing methods for localising and understanding shortcut learning are mostly based upon qualitative, image-level inspection and assume cues are human-visible, limiting their use in domains such as medical imaging. We introduce OSCAR (Ordinal Scoring Correlations for Attribution Representations), a model-agnostic framework for quantifying shortcut learning and localising shortcut features. OSCAR converts image-level task attribution maps into dataset-level rank profiles of image regions and compares them across three models: a balanced baseline model (BA), a test model (TS), and a sensitive attribute predictor (SA). By computing pairwise, partial, and deviation-based correlations on these rank profiles, we produce a set of quantitative metrics that characterise the degree of shortcut reliance for TS, together with a ranking of image-level regions that contribute most to it. Experiments on CelebA, CheXpert, and ADNI show that our correlations are (i) stable across seeds and partitions, (ii) sensitive to the level of association between shortcut features and output labels in the training data, and (iii) able to distinguish localised from diffuse shortcut features. As an illustration of the utility of our method, we show how worst-group performance disparities can be reduced using a simple test-time attenuation approach based on the identified shortcut regions. OSCAR provides a lightweight, pixel-space audit that yields statistical decision rules and spatial maps, enabling users to test, localise, and mitigate shortcut reliance.

Existing multi-prompt learning methods primarily focus on utilizing various meticulously designed prompts within a single foundation vision-language model to achieve superior performance. However, the overlooked model-prompt matching bias hinders the development of multi-prompt learning, i.e., the same prompt can convey different semantics across distinct vision-language models, such as CLIP-ViT-B/16 and CLIP-ViT-B/32, resulting in inconsistent predictions of identical prompt. To mitigate the impact of this bias on downstream tasks, we explore an ensemble learning approach to sufficiently aggregate the benefits of diverse predictions. Additionally, we further disclose the presence of sample-prompt matching bias, which originates from the prompt-irrelevant semantics encapsulated in the input samples. Thus, directly utilizing all information from the input samples for generating weights of ensemble learning can lead to suboptimal performance. In response, we extract prompt-relevant semantics from input samples by leveraging the guidance of the information theory-based analysis, adaptively calculating debiased ensemble weights. Overall, we propose Adaptive-Debiased Ensemble MultiPrompt Learning, abbreviated as AmPLe, to mitigate the two types of bias simultaneously. Extensive experiments on three representative tasks, i.e., generalization to novel classes, new target datasets, and unseen domain shifts, show that AmPLe can widely outperform existing methods.

This raises a basic question: is there a general, modality-agnostic way to quantify how acquisition itself preserves or destroys the information that downstream learners could use? Here we propose an acquisition-level scalar $ΔS_{\\mathcal B}$ based on instrument-resolved phase space. Unlike pixelwise distortion or purely spectral errors that often saturate under aggressive undersampling, $ΔS_{\\mathcal B}$ directly quantifies how acquisition mixes or removes joint space--frequency structure at the instrument scale. We show theoretically that \\(ΔS_{\\mathcal B}\\) correctly identifies the phase-space coherence of periodic sampling as the physical source of aliasing, recovering classical sampling-theorem consequences. Empirically, across masked image classification, accelerated MRI, and massive MIMO (including over-the-air measurements), $|ΔS_{\\mathcal B}|$ consistently ranks sampling geometries and predicts downstream reconstruction/recognition difficulty \\emph{without training}. In particular, minimizing $|ΔS_{\\mathcal B}|$ enables zero-training selection of variable-density MRI mask parameters that matches designs tuned by conventional pre-reconstruction criteria.

Existing solutions for this problem are limited by either the usage of a large and rigid list of vocabularies or by the dependency on complex pipelines with fragile heuristics where errors propagate across stages. Meanwhile, the ability of recent large multi-modal models (LMMs) equipped with explicit or implicit reasoning to comprehend visual-language data, decompose problems, retrieve latent knowledge, and self-correct suggests a more principled and effective alternative. Building on these capabilities, we propose FiNDR (Fine-grained Name Discovery via Reasoning), the first reasoning-augmented LMM-based framework for vocabulary-free fine-grained recognition. The system operates in three automated steps: (i) a reasoning-enabled LMM generates descriptive candidate labels for each image; (ii) a vision-language model filters and ranks these candidates to form a coherent class set; and (iii) the verified names instantiate a lightweight multi-modal classifier used at inference time. Extensive experiments on popular fine-grained classification benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance under the vocabulary-free setting, with a significant relative margin of up to 18.8% over previous approaches. Remarkably, the proposed method surpasses zero-shot baselines that exploit pre-defined ground-truth names, challenging the assumption that human-curated vocabularies define an upper bound. Additionally, we show that carefully curated prompts enable open-source LMMs to match proprietary counterparts.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are one of the effective solutions for addressing insufficient samples. Nevertheless, traditional GAN fail to account for the mapping relationship between labels and features, which limits further performance improvement. Although some studies have proposed solutions, none have considered both performance and efficiency simultaneously. To address these problems, this paper proposes the multi-task learning-based regression GAN framework that integrates regression information into both the discriminator and generator, and implements a shallow sharing mechanism between the discriminator and regressor. This approach significantly enhances the quality of generated samples while improving the algorithm's operational efficiency. Moreover, considering the importance of training samples and generated samples, a dual data evaluation strategy is designed to make GAN generate more diverse samples, thereby increasing the generalization of subsequent modeling.

However, the high computational cost of processing dense visual tokens remains a major bottleneck. A critical component in this pipeline is the visual projector, which bridges the vision encoder and the language model. Standard designs often employ a simple multi-layer perceptron for direct token mapping, but this approach scales poorly with high-resolution inputs, introducing significant redundancy. We present Delta-LLaVA, a token-efficient projector that employs a low-rank DeltaProjection to align multi-level vision features into a compact subspace before further interaction. On top of this base alignment, lightweight Transformer blocks act as specialization layers, capturing both global and local structure under constrained token budgets. Extensive experiments and ablations demonstrate that this base-then-specialize design yields consistent gains across multiple benchmarks with only 144 tokens, highlighting the importance of token formation prior to scaling interaction capacity. With Delta-LLaVA, inference throughput improves by up to 55%, while end-to-end training accelerates by nearly 4-5x in pretraining and over 1.5x in finetuning, highlighting the dual benefits of our design in both efficiency and scalability."}

Our approach leverages an art-specific Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) on top of latent embeddings of generative image models.

However, they often overlook the interference between high-confidence visible-region perception and low-confidence occluded-region reasoning caused by single-image input, which can lead to feature dilution and error propagation.\n  To address these challenges, we introduce an offline Visible Region Label Extraction (VRLE) strategy that explicitly separates and extracts voxel-level supervision for visible regions from dense 3D ground truth. This strategy purifies the supervisory space for two complementary sub-tasks: visible-region perception and occluded-region reasoning. Building on this idea, we propose the Visible-Occluded Interactive Completion Network (VOIC), a novel dual-decoder framework that explicitly decouples SSC into visible-region semantic perception and occluded-region scene completion. VOIC first constructs a base 3D voxel representation by fusing image features with depth-derived occupancy. The visible decoder focuses on generating high-fidelity geometric and semantic priors, while the occlusion decoder leverages these priors together with cross-modal interaction to perform coherent global scene reasoning.\n  Extensive experiments on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI360 benchmarks demonstrate that VOIC outperforms existing monocular SSC methods in both geometric completion and semantic segmentation accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art performance."}

Existing approaches such as CoOp or LoRA provide only partial remedies, as they remain confined to the pre-trained semantic space.\n  To overcome this bottleneck, we propose dynamic representation optimization, realized through the Guided Target-Matching Adaptation (GTMA) framework. At inference time, GTMA constructs a continuous pseudo-word embedding that best aligns with an OOD image's visual anchor, effectively bypassing vocabulary limitations. The optimization is driven by an adaptive gradient-based representation policy optimization algorithm, which incorporates semantic regularization to preserve plausibility and compatibility with the model's prior knowledge.\n  Experiments on ImageNet-R and the VISTA-Beyond benchmark demonstrate that GTMA improves zero-shot and few-shot OOD accuracy by up to 15-20 percent over the base VLM while maintaining performance on in-distribution concepts.

Model merging aims to merge the distinct capabilities of these specialised models into a unified model, requiring minimal or even no additional training. A core objective of model merging is to ensure the merged model retains the behavioural characteristics of the specialised models, typically achieved through feature alignment. We identify that features consist of two critical components: direction and magnitude. Prior research has predominantly focused on directional alignment, while the influence of magnitude remains largely neglected, despite its pronounced vulnerability to perturbations introduced by common merging operations (e.g., parameter fusion and sparsification). Such perturbations to magnitude inevitably lead to feature deviations in the merged model from the specialised models, resulting in subsequent performance degradation. To address this, we propose MAGnItude Calibration (MAGIC), a plug-and-play framework that rectifies layer-wise magnitudes in feature and weight spaces, with three variants. Specifically, our Feature Space Calibration (FSC) realigns the merged model's features using a small set of unlabelled data, while Weight Space Calibration (WSC) extends this calibration to the weight space without requiring additional data. Combining these yields Dual Space Calibration (DSC).

Recent increases in drought severity, frequency, and duration underscore the need for effective monitoring and mitigation strategies. Predicting drought impacts rather than drought conditions alone offers opportunities to support early warning systems and proactive decision-making. This study applies machine learning techniques to link drought indices with historical drought impact records (2005:2024) to generate short-term impact forecasts. By addressing key conceptual and data-driven challenges regarding temporal scale and impact quantification, the study aims to improve the predictability of drought impacts at actionable lead times. The Drought Severity and Coverage Index (DSCI) and the Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) were combined with impact data from the Drought Impact Reporter (DIR) to model and forecast weekly drought impacts. Results indicate that Fire and Relief impacts were predicted with the highest accuracy, followed by Agriculture and Water, while forecasts for Plants and Society impacts showed greater variability. County and state level forecasts for New Mexico were produced using an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model that incorporated both DSCI and ESI. The model successfully generated forecasts up to eight weeks in advance using the preceding eight weeks of data for most impact categories. This work supports the development of an Ecological Drought Information Communication System (EcoDri) for New Mexico and demonstrates the potential for broader application in similar drought-prone regions.

The current state-of-the-art method, KG-SP, addresses this issue by training distinct classifiers for states and objects, while leveraging a semantic model to evaluate the plausibility of composed compositions. However, KG-SP's accuracy in state and object recognition can be further improved, and it fails to consider the weighting of states and objects during composition. In this study, we propose SASOW, an enhancement of KG-SP that considers the weighting of states and objects while improving composition recognition accuracy. First, we introduce self-attention mechanisms into the classifiers for states and objects, leading to enhanced accuracy in recognizing both. Additionally, we incorporate the weighting of states and objects during composition to generate more reasonable and accurate compositions. Our validation process involves testing SASOW on three established benchmark datasets. Experimental outcomes affirm when compared against OW-CZSL approach, KG-SP, SASOW showcases improvements of 2.1%, 1.7%, and 0.4% in terms of accuracy for unseen compositions across the MIT-States, UT Zappos, and C-GQA datasets, respectively."}

This paper presents a robust detection framework that leverages multiple uncertainty measures to decide whether to trust or reject a model's predictions. We focus on three complementary techniques: Fisher Information, which captures the sensitivity of model parameters to input variations; entropy-based uncertainty from Monte Carlo Dropout, which reflects predictive variability; and predictive variance from a Deep Kernel Learning framework using a Gaussian Process classifier. To integrate these diverse uncertainty signals, Particle Swarm Optimisation is used to learn optimal weightings and determine an adaptive rejection threshold. The model is trained on Stable Diffusion-generated images and evaluated on GLIDE, VQDM, Midjourney, BigGAN, and StyleGAN3, each introducing significant distribution shifts. While standard metrics such as prediction probability and Fisher-based measures perform well in distribution, their effectiveness degrades under shift. In contrast, the Combined Uncertainty measure consistently achieves an incorrect rejection rate of approximately 70 percent on unseen generators, successfully filtering most misclassified AI samples. Although the system occasionally rejects correct predictions from newer generators, this conservative behaviour is acceptable, as rejected samples can support retraining. The framework maintains high acceptance of accurate predictions for natural images and in-domain AI data. Under adversarial attacks using FGSM and PGD, the Combined Uncertainty method rejects around 61 percent of successful attacks, while GP-based uncertainty alone achieves up to 80 percent. Overall, the results demonstrate that multi-source uncertainty fusion provides a resilient and adaptive solution for AI-generated image detection."}

We begin with A-MPLang, the fragment without activation functions, and give a characterization of its expressive power in terms of walk-summed features. For bounded activation functions, we show that (under mild conditions) all eventually constant activations yield the same expressive power - numerical and Boolean - and that it subsumes previously established logics for GNNs with eventually constant activation functions but without linear layers. Finally, we prove the first expressive separation between unbounded and bounded activations in the presence of linear layers: MPLang with ReLU is strictly more powerful for numerical queries than MPLang with eventually constant activation functions, e.g., truncated ReLU. This hinges on subtle interactions between linear aggregation and eventually constant non-linearities, and it establishes that GNNs using ReLU are more expressive than those restricted to eventually constant activations and linear layers."}

To this end, we introduce ICP-4D, a simple yet effective training-free framework that unifies spatial and temporal reasoning through geometric relations among instance-level point sets. Specifically, we apply the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm to directly associate temporally consistent instances by aligning the source and target point sets through the estimated transformation. To stabilize association under noisy instance predictions, we introduce a Sinkhorn-based soft matching. This exploits the underlying instance distribution to obtain accurate point-wise correspondences, resulting in robust geometric alignment. Furthermore, our carefully designed pipeline, which considers three instance types-static, dynamic, and missing-offers computational efficiency and occlusion-aware matching. Our extensive experiments across both SemanticKITTI and panoptic nuScenes demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, even without additional training or extra point cloud inputs."}

Existing methods often lack adaptability to dynamic conditions and fail to optimize decision making in real time. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid reinforcement learning framework integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for enhanced spoilage prediction. This hybrid architecture captures temporal dependencies within sensor data, enabling robust and adaptive decision making. In alignment with interpretable artificial intelligence principles, a rule-based classifier environment is employed to provide transparent ground truth labeling of spoilage levels based on domain-specific thresholds. This structured design allows the agent to operate within clearly defined semantic boundaries, supporting traceable and interpretable decisions. Model behavior is monitored using interpretability-driven metrics, including spoilage accuracy, reward-to-step ratio, loss reduction rate, and exploration decay. These metrics provide both quantitative performance evaluation and insights into learning dynamics. A class-wise spoilage distribution visualization is used to analyze the agents decision profile and policy behavior. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-time hardware data demonstrate that the LSTM and RNN based agent outperforms alternative reinforcement learning approaches in prediction accuracy and decision efficiency while maintaining interpretability.

HCDV collapses the factorial burden to O(T sum_{l} K_{l}) = O(T K_max log n), rewards examples that sharpen decision boundaries, and regularizes outliers through curvature-based smoothness. We prove that HCDV approximately satisfies the four Shapley axioms with surplus loss O(eta log n), enjoys sub-Gaussian coalition deviation tilde O(1/sqrt{T}), and incurs at most k epsilon_infty regret for top-k selection. Experiments on four benchmarks--tabular, vision, streaming, and a 45M-sample CTR task--plus the OpenDataVal suite show that HCDV lifts accuracy by up to +5 pp, slashes valuation time by up to 100x, and directly supports tasks such as augmentation filtering, low-latency streaming updates, and fair marketplace payouts."}

Our systematic evaluation of five architectures reveals striking modality-dependent performance patterns: Hopfield networks achieve 97.68% accuracy on visual tasks but only 76.15% on auditory tasks (21.53 point gap), revealing severe modality-specific specialization, while SCL demonstrates more balanced cross-modal performance (96.72% visual, 82.16% audio, 14.56 point gap).

Distinct from Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with fixed node activations and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) featuring learnable edge activations, SNs utilize shared, learnable splines (monotonic and general) within structured blocks incorporating explicit shift parameters and mixing weights. Our approach directly realizes Sprecher's specific 1965 sum of shifted splines formula in its single-layer variant and extends it to deeper, multi-layer compositions. We further enhance the architecture with optional lateral mixing connections that enable intra-block communication between output dimensions, providing a parameter-efficient alternative to full attention mechanisms. Beyond parameter efficiency with $O(LN + LG)$ scaling (where $G$ is the knot count of the shared splines) versus MLPs' $O(LN^2)$, SNs admit a sequential evaluation strategy that reduces peak forward-intermediate memory from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$ (treating batch size as constant), making much wider architectures feasible under memory constraints.

In this work, we treat interactions as the fundamental units of such structure and investigate a largely unexplored question: how DNNs encode interactions under different levels of contextual complexity, and how these microscopic interaction patterns shape macroscopic representation capacity. To quantify this complexity, we use multi-order interactions [57], where each order reflects the amount of contextual information required to evaluate the joint interaction utility of a variable pair. This formulation enables a stratified analysis of cooperative patterns learned by DNNs. Building on this formulation, we develop a comprehensive study of interaction structure in DNNs. (i) We empirically discover a universal interaction bottleneck: across architectures and tasks, DNNs easily learn low-order and high-order interactions but consistently under-represent mid-order ones. (ii) We theoretically explain this bottleneck by proving that mid-order interactions incur the highest contextual variability, yielding large gradient variance and making them intrinsically difficult to learn. (iii) We further modulate the bottleneck by introducing losses that steer models toward emphasizing interactions of selected orders. Finally, we connect microscopic interaction structures with macroscopic representational behavior: low-order-emphasized models exhibit stronger generalization and robustness, whereas high-order-emphasized models demonstrate greater structural modeling and fitting capability. Together, these results uncover an inherent representational bias in modern DNNs and establish interaction order as a powerful lens for interpreting and guiding deep representations."}

Given a reference image (e.g., one's pet), we expect the generated image to retain precise details attached to the subject's identity. However, current generative evaluation metrics emphasize the overall semantic similarity between the reference and the output, and overlook these fine-grained discriminative details. We introduce Finer-Personalization Rank, an evaluation protocol tailored to identity preservation. Instead of pairwise similarity, Finer-Personalization Rank adopts a ranking view: it treats each generated image as a query against an identity-labeled gallery consisting of visually similar real images. Retrieval metrics (e.g., mean average precision) measure performance, where higher scores indicate that identity-specific details (e.g., a distinctive head spot) are preserved. We assess identity at multiple granularities -- from fine-grained categories (e.g., bird species, car models) to individual instances (e.g., re-identification). Across CUB, Stanford Cars, and animal Re-ID benchmarks, Finer-Personalization Rank more faithfully reflects identity retention than semantic-only metrics and reveals substantial identity drift in several popular personalization methods. These results position the gallery-based protocol as a principled and practical evaluation for personalized generation."}

We propose using human brain activity not as a training signal but as a coordinate system for reading and steering LLM states. Using the SMN4Lang MEG dataset, we construct a word-level brain atlas of phase-locking value (PLV) patterns and extract latent axes via ICA. We validate axes with independent lexica and NER-based labels (POS/log-frequency used as sanity checks), then train lightweight adapters that map LLM hidden states to these brain axes without fine-tuning the LLM. Steering along the resulting brain-derived directions yields a robust lexical (frequency-linked) axis in a mid TinyLlama layer, surviving perplexity-matched controls, and a brain-vs-text probe comparison shows larger log-frequency shifts (relative to the text probe) with lower perplexity for the brain axis. A function/content axis (axis 13) shows consistent steering in TinyLlama, Qwen2-0.5B, and GPT-2, with PPL-matched text-level corroboration. Layer-4 effects in TinyLlama are large but inconsistent, so we treat them as secondary (Appendix). Axis structure is stable when the atlas is rebuilt without GPT embedding-change features or with word2vec embeddings (|r|=0.64-0.95 across matched axes), reducing circularity concerns. Exploratory fMRI anchoring suggests potential alignment for embedding change and log frequency, but effects are sensitive to hemodynamic modeling assumptions and are treated as population-level evidence only. These results support a new interface: neurophysiology-grounded axes provide interpretable and controllable handles for LLM behavior."}

To this end, we present a Bayesian Deep Learning Framework to detect neuronal activities in 4D spatio-temporal data obtained by light sheet microscopy. Our approach accounts for the use of temporal information by calculating pixel wise correlation maps and combines it with spatial information given by the mean summary image. The Bayesian framework not only produces probability segmentation maps but also models the uncertainty pertaining to active neuron detection. To evaluate the accuracy of our framework we implemented the test of reproducibility to assert the generalization of the network to detect neuron activity. The network achieved a mean Dice Score of 0.81 relative to the synthetic Ground Truth obtained by Otsu's method and a mean Dice Score of 0.79 between the first and second run for test of reproducibility.

In physics, conservation laws of Hamiltonian systems such as symplecticity guarantee long-term stability, and recent work has begun to hard-wire such constraints into learning models at the loss or output level. Here we ask a different question: what would it mean for the representation itself to obey a symplectic conservation law in the sense of Hamiltonian mechanics?\n  We express this symplectic constraint through Legendre duality: the pairing between primal and dual parameters, which becomes the structure that the representation must preserve. We formalize Legendre dynamics as stochastic processes whose trajectories remain on Legendre graphs, so that the evolving primal-dual parameters stay Legendre dual. We show that this class includes linear time-invariant Gaussian process regression and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamics.\n  Geometrically, we prove that the maps that preserve all Legendre graphs are exactly symplectomorphisms of cotangent bundles of the form \"cotangent lift of a base diffeomorphism followed by an exact fibre translation\". Dynamically, this characterization leads to the design of a Symplectic Reservoir (SR), a reservoir-computing architecture that is a special case of recurrent neural network and whose recurrent core is generated by Hamiltonian systems that are at most linear in the momentum.\n  Our main theorem shows that every SR update has this normal form and therefore transports Legendre graphs to Legendre graphs, preserving Legendre duality at each time step. Overall, SR implements a geometrically constrained, Legendre-preserving representation map, injecting symplectic geometry and Hamiltonian mechanics directly at the representational level."}

Preprint under review for journal submission", "summary": "Few-shot action recognition aims to enable models to quickly learn new action categories from limited labeled samples, addressing the challenge of data scarcity in real-world applications. Current research primarily addresses three core challenges: (1) temporal modeling, where models are prone to interference from irrelevant static background information and struggle to capture the essence of dynamic action features; (2) visual similarity, where categories with subtle visual differences are difficult to distinguish; and (3) the modality gap between visual-textual support prototypes and visual-only queries, which complicates alignment within a shared embedding space. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a CLIP-SPM framework, which includes three components: (1) the Hierarchical Synergistic Motion Refinement (HSMR) module, which aligns deep and shallow motion features to improve temporal modeling by reducing static background interference; (2) the Semantic Prototype Modulation (SPM) strategy, which generates query-relevant text prompts to bridge the modality gap and integrates them with visual features, enhancing the discriminability between similar actions; and (3) the Prototype-Anchor Dual Modulation (PADM) method, which refines support prototypes and aligns query features with a global semantic anchor, improving consistency across support and query samples. Comprehensive experiments across standard benchmarks, including Kinetics, SSv2-Full, SSv2-Small, UCF101, and HMDB51, demonstrate that our CLIP-SPM achieves competitive performance under 1-shot, 3-shot, and 5-shot settings. Extensive ablation studies and visual analyses further validate the effectiveness of each component and its contributions to addressing the core challenges.

LLM-CAS trains an agent to learn a policy that dynamically selects temporary neuron perturbations during inference based on the current context. Unlike prior dynamic approaches that rely on heuristic or predefined adjustments, this policy driven mechanism enables adaptive and fine grained correction without permanent parameter modification.\n  Experiments across multiple language models demonstrate that LLM-CAS consistently improves factual accuracy, achieving gains of 10.98 percentage points on StoryCloze, 2.71 points on TriviaQA, and 2.06 points on the MC1 score of TruthfulQA.

We argue that learnability in dynamical systems should be studied as a finite-sample question, and be based on the properties of the underlying dynamics rather than the statistical properties of the resulting sequence. To this end, we give a formulation of learnability for stochastic processes induced by dynamical systems, focusing on guarantees that hold uniformly at every time step after a finite burn-in period. This leads to a notion of dynamic learnability which captures how the structure of a system, such as stability, mixing, observability, and spectral properties, governs the number of observations required before reliable prediction becomes possible. We illustrate the framework in the case of linear dynamical systems, showing that accurate prediction can be achieved after finite observation without system identification, by leveraging improper methods based on spectral filtering. We survey the relationship between learning in dynamical systems and classical PAC, online, and universal prediction theories, and suggest directions for studying nonlinear and controlled systems."}

Deep learning-based watermarking has improved robustness to diffusion-based image editing, but a gap remains when a watermarked image is converted to video by image-to-video (I2V), in which per-frame watermark detection weakens. I2V has quickly advanced from short, jittery clips to multi-second, temporally coherent scenes, and it now serves not only content creation but also world-modeling and simulation workflows, making cross-modal watermark recovery crucial. We present WaTeRFlow, a framework tailored for robustness under I2V. It consists of (i) FUSE (Flow-guided Unified Synthesis Engine), which exposes the encoder-decoder to realistic distortions via instruction-driven edits and a fast video diffusion proxy during training, (ii) optical-flow warping with a Temporal Consistency Loss (TCL) that stabilizes per-frame predictions, and (iii) a semantic preservation loss that maintains the conditioning signal.

This disentanglement is achieved by enforcing analogical consistency in the embedding space to ensure the semantic transformation of adding an attribute (e.g., a length constraint) remains invariant across different problem contexts. This enables our model to reuse invariant semantics across trained variants and construct representations for unseen combinations. ARC achieves state-of-the-art performance across in-distribution, zero-shot generalization, few-shot adaptation, and real-world benchmarks."}

We argue that standard multi-head attention is best seen as a form of tensor lifting: hidden vectors are mapped into a high-dimensional space of pairwise interactions, and learning proceeds by constraining this lifted tensor through gradient descent. This mechanism is extremely expressive but mathematically opaque, because after many layers it becomes very hard to describe the model with a small family of explicit invariants.\n  To explore an alternative, we propose an attention-free architecture based on Grassmann flows. Instead of forming an L by L attention matrix, our Causal Grassmann layer (i) linearly reduces token states, (ii) encodes local token pairs as two-dimensional subspaces on a Grassmann manifold via Plucker coordinates, and (iii) fuses these geometric features back into the hidden states through gated mixing. Information therefore propagates by controlled deformations of low-rank subspaces over multi-scale local windows, so the core computation lives on a finite-dimensional manifold rather than in an unstructured tensor space.\n  On the Wikitext-2 language modeling benchmark, purely Grassmann-based models with 13 to 18 million parameters achieve validation perplexities within about 10 to 15 percent of size-matched Transformers. On the SNLI natural language inference task, a Grassmann-Plucker head on top of DistilBERT slightly outperforms a Transformer head, with best validation and test accuracies of 0.8550 and 0.8538 compared to 0.8545 and 0.8511. We analyze the complexity of Grassmann mixing, show linear scaling in sequence length for fixed rank, and argue that such manifold-based designs offer a more structured route toward geometric and invariant-based interpretations of neural reasoning."}

To address these issues, we propose Decoupled Generative Modeling for Human-Object Interaction Synthesis (DecHOI), which separates path planning and action synthesis. A trajectory generator first produces human and object trajectories without prescribed waypoints, and an action generator conditions on these paths to synthesize detailed motions. To further improve contact realism, we employ adversarial training with a discriminator that focuses on the dynamics of distal joints. The framework also models a moving counterpart and supports responsive, long-sequence planning in dynamic scenes, while preserving plan consistency. Across two benchmarks, FullBodyManipulation and 3D-FUTURE, DecHOI surpasses prior methods on most quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, and perceptual studies likewise prefer our results."}

In this work, we introduce an inverse scattering inspired Fourier Neural Operator(IS-FNO), motivated by the reversibility and spectral evolution structure underlying the classical inverse scattering transform. The proposed architecture enforces a near-reversible pairing between lifting and projection maps through an explicitly invertible neural transformation, and models latent temporal evolution using exponential Fourier layers that naturally encode linear and nonlinear spectral dynamics. We systematically evaluate IS-FNO against baseline FNO and Koopman-based models on a range of benchmark PDEs, including the Michelson-Sivashinsky and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations (in one and two dimensions), as well as the integrable Korteweg-de Vries and Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equations. The results demonstrate that IS-FNO achieves lower short-term errors and substantially improved long-horizon stability in non-stiff regimes. For integrable systems, reduced IS-FNO variants that embed analytical scattering structure retain competitive long-term accuracy despite limited model capacity. Overall, this work shows that incorporating physical structure -- particularly reversibility and spectral evolution -- into neural operator design significantly enhances robustness and long-term predictive fidelity for nonlinear PDE dynamics."}

To mitigate hallucinations in both the language and visual modalities, we introduce Hallucination Disentangled Decoding (HDD) method that requires no training.

This task is commonly formulated as open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation. Although recent methods demonstrate strong performance, they depend heavily on SAM and CLIP to generate and classify 3D instance masks from images accompanying the point cloud, leading to substantial computational overhead and slow processing that limit their deployment in real-world settings. Open-YOLO 3D alleviates this issue by using a real-time 2D detector to classify class-agnostic masks produced directly from the point cloud by a pretrained 3D segmenter, eliminating the need for SAM and CLIP and significantly reducing inference time. However, Open-YOLO 3D often fails to generalize to object categories that appear infrequently in the 3D training data. In this paper, we propose a method that generates 3D instance masks for novel objects from RGB images guided by a 2D open-vocabulary detector. Our approach inherits the 2D detector's ability to recognize novel objects while maintaining efficient classification, enabling fast and accurate retrieval of rare instances from open-ended text queries.

A fundamental challenge in observational data is that while we need to infer outcome differences under alternative treatments, we can only observe each individual's outcome under a single treatment. Existing approaches address this limitation either by training with inferred pseudo-outcomes or by creating matched instance pairs. However, recent work has largely overlooked the potential impact of post-treatment variables on the outcome. This oversight prevents existing methods from fully capturing outcome variability, resulting in increased variance in counterfactual predictions. This paper introduces Pseudo-outcome Imputation with Post-treatment Variables for Counterfactual Regression (PIPCFR), a novel approach that incorporates post-treatment variables to improve pseudo-outcome imputation. We analyze the challenges inherent in utilizing post-treatment variables and establish a novel theoretical bound for ITE risk that explicitly connects post-treatment variables to ITE estimation accuracy. Unlike existing methods that ignore these variables or impose restrictive assumptions, PIPCFR learns effective representations that preserve informative components while mitigating bias. Empirical evaluations on both real-world and simulated datasets demonstrate that PIPCFR achieves significantly lower ITE errors compared to existing methods."}

We propose a lightweight IDS that combines SHAP-guided feature pruning with knowledge-distilled Kronecker networks. A high-capacity teacher model identifies the most relevant features through SHAP explanations, and a compressed student leverages Kronecker-structured layers to minimize parameters while preserving discriminative inputs. Knowledge distillation transfers softened decision boundaries from teacher to student, improving generalization under compression. Experiments on the TON\\_IoT dataset show that the student is nearly three orders of magnitude smaller than the teacher yet sustains macro-F1 above 0.986 with millisecond-level inference latency.

We introduce RankInsight, an open-source toolkit that seeks to address these limitations. RankInsight (1) computes pair-wise significance maps that show the nnU-Net family outperforms Vision-Language and MONAI submissions with high statistical certainty; (2) recomputes leaderboards with organ-appropriate metrics, reversing the order of the top four models when Dice is replaced by NSD for tubular structures; and (3) audits intersectional fairness, revealing that more than half of the MONAI-based entries have the largest gender-race discrepancy on our proprietary Johns Hopkins Hospital dataset.

To meet these challenges, we propose IPCV, a training-free, information-preserving compression framework for MLLM visual encoders. IPCV enables aggressive token pruning inside the ViT via Neighbor-Guided Reconstruction (NGR) that temporarily reconstructs pruned tokens to participate in attention with minimal overhead, then fully restores them before passing to the LLM. Besides, we introduce Attention Stabilization (AS) to further alleviate the negative influence from token pruning by approximating the K/V of pruned tokens. It can be directly applied to previous LLM-side token pruning methods to enhance their performance. Extensive experiments show that IPCV substantially reduces end-to-end computation and outperforms state-of-the-art training-free token compression methods across diverse image and video benchmarks.

Most research to-date builds on domain-knowledge-based corruption risk indicators of individual contract-level features and some also analyzes contracting network patterns. A critical barrier for supervised machine learning is the absence of confirmed non-corrupt, negative, examples, which makes conventional machine learning inappropriate for this task. Using publicly available data on federally funded procurement in Mexico and company sanction records, this study implements positive-unlabeled (PU) learning algorithms that integrate domain-knowledge-based red flags with network-derived features to identify likely corrupt and fraudulent contracts. The best-performing PU model on average captures 32 percent more known positives and performs on average 2.3 times better than random guessing, substantially outperforming approaches based solely on traditional red flags. The analysis of the Shapley Additive Explanations reveals that network-derived features, particularly those associated with contracts in the network core or suppliers with high eigenvector centrality, are the most important. Traditional red flags further enhance model performance in line with expectations, albeit mainly for contracts awarded through competitive tenders. This methodology can support law enforcement in Mexico, and it can be adapted to other national contexts too."}

To overcome these challenges, we present MambaMDN, a dual-domain framework for multi-contrast MRI reconstruction. Our approach first employs fully-sampled reference K-space data to complete the undersampled target data, generating structurally aligned but modality-mixed inputs.

This structure increases training expense and limits the physical interpretability of the stochastic perturbations. We introduce Stochastic Decomposition Layers (SDL) for converting deterministic machine learning weather models into probabilistic ensemble systems. Adapted from StyleGAN's hierarchical noise injection, SDL applies learned perturbations at three decoder scales through latent-driven modulation, per-pixel noise, and channel scaling. When applied to WXFormer via transfer learning, SDL requires less than 2\\% of the computational cost needed to train the baseline model. Each ensemble member is generated from a compact latent tensor (5 MB), enabling perfect reproducibility and post-inference spread adjustment through latent rescaling. Evaluation on 2022 ERA5 reanalysis shows ensembles with spread-skill ratios approaching unity and rank histograms that progressively flatten toward uniformity through medium-range forecasts, achieving calibration competitive with operational IFS-ENS. Multi-scale experiments reveal hierarchical uncertainty: coarse layers modulate synoptic patterns while fine layers control mesoscale variability.

To date, long-term and accurate MJO prediction has remained a challenge for researchers. Conventional MJO prediction methods using Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) are resource-intensive, time-consuming, and highly unstable (most NWP methods are sensitive to seasons, with better MJO forecast results in winter). While existing Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods save resources and speed forecasting, their accuracy never reaches the 28 days predicted by the state-of-the-art NWP method, i.e., the operational forecasts from ECMWF, since neural networks cannot handle climate data effectively. In this paper, we present a Domain Knowledge Embedded Spatio-Temporal Network (DK-STN), a stable neural network model for accurate and efficient MJO forecasting. It combines the benefits of NWP and ANN methods and successfully improves the forecast accuracy of ANN methods while maintaining a high level of efficiency and stability. We begin with a spatial-temporal network (STN) and embed domain knowledge in it using two key methods: (i) applying a domain knowledge enhancement method and (ii) integrating a domain knowledge processing method into network training. We evaluated DK-STN with the 5th generation of ECMWF reanalysis (ERA5) data and compared it with ECMWF. Given 7 days of climate data as input, DK-STN can generate reliable forecasts for the following 28 days in 1-2 seconds, with an error of only 2-3 days in different seasons.

In this work, we explore whether representation learning can help address these limitations. Specifically, we focus on representations derived from the singular value decomposition of the partial covariance operator and use them to construct a simple test statistic, reminiscent of the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). We also introduce a practical bi-level contrastive algorithm to learn these representations. Our theory links representation learning error to test performance and establishes asymptotic validity and power guarantees.

Our analysis reveals that the representation space of MLLMs is overwhelmingly dominated by textual semantics; the visual information essential for multimodal retrieval only constitutes a small portion. This imbalance is compounded by the heavy focus of MLLMs on bridging image-text modalities, which facilitates generation but homogenizes embeddings and finally diminishes the discriminative power required for multimodal retrieval. We further discover that the specific feature components that contribute most to the similarity computations for MLLMs are in fact distractors that actively degrade retrieval performance. Overall, our work provides the first in-depth interpretability analysis of MLLM representations in the context of multimodal retrieval and offers possible directions for enhancing the multimodal retrieval capabilities of MLLMs."}

Existing models, however, cannot perform all these tasks within a unified framework, and effective training strategies for such models remain underexplored. To fill these gaps, this paper proposes CrashChat, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) for multitask traffic crash analysis, built upon VideoLLaMA3. CrashChat acquires domain-specific knowledge through instruction fine-tuning and employs a novel multitask learning strategy based on task decoupling and grouping, which maximizes the benefit of joint learning within and across task groups while mitigating negative transfer. Numerical experiments on consolidated public datasets demonstrate that CrashChat consistently outperforms existing MLLMs across model scales and traditional vision-based methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Crucially, our analysis of downstream planning tasks reveals a severe asymmetry: while rearward perception errors are often tolerable, inaccuracies in the forward region directly precipitate hazardous driving maneuvers. To bridge this safety gap, we propose AMap, a novel framework for Ahead-aware online HD Mapping. We pioneer a ``distill-from-future\" paradigm, where a teacher model with privileged access to future temporal contexts guides a lightweight student model restricted to the current frame. This process implicitly compresses prospective knowledge into the student model, endowing it with ``look-ahead\" capabilities at zero inference-time cost.

In this work, we present a large-scale empirical analysis of Human-AI Difficulty Alignment for over 20 models across diverse domains such as medical knowledge and mathematical reasoning. Our findings reveal a systematic misalignment where scaling up model size is not reliably helpful; instead of aligning with humans, models converge toward a shared machine consensus. We observe that high performance often impedes accurate difficulty estimation, as models struggle to simulate the capability limitations of students even when being explicitly prompted to adopt specific proficiency levels.

However, learning-based scheduling on unrelated parallel machines remains particularly difficult to design. Not only do the numbers of jobs and machines vary, but each job-machine pair has a unique processing time, dynamically altering feature dimensions. We propose a novel approach with a neural network tailored for offline deterministic scheduling of arbitrary sizes on unrelated machines. The goal is to minimize a complex objective function that includes the makespan and the weighted tardiness of jobs and machines. Unlike existing online approaches, which process jobs sequentially, our method generates a complete schedule considering the entire input at once. The key contribution of this work lies in the sophisticated architecture of our model. By leveraging various NLP-inspired architectures, it effectively processes any number of jobs and machines with varying feature dimensions imposed by unrelated processing times. Our approach enables supervised training on small problem instances while demonstrating strong generalization to much larger scheduling environments. Trained and tested on instances with 8 jobs and 4 machines, costs were only 2.51% above optimal. Across all tested configurations of up to 100 jobs and 10 machines, our network consistently outperformed an advanced dispatching rule, which incurred 22.22% higher costs on average. As our method allows fast retraining with simulated data and adaptation to various scheduling conditions, we believe it has the potential to become a standard approach for learning-based scheduling on unrelated machines and similar problem environments."}

We systematically investigate the interplay between quantization precision (FP16, INT8, INT4) and replay buffer strategies in large language models, revealing unexpected dynamics. While FP16 achieves superior initial task performance (74.44% on NLU), we observe a striking inversion on subsequent tasks: quantized models outperform FP16 by 8-15% on final task forward accuracy, with INT4 achieving nearly double FP16's performance on Code generation (40% vs 20%). Critically, even minimal replay buffers (0.1%) dramatically improve retention - increasing NLU retention after Math training from 45% to 65% across all precision levels - with INT8 consistently achieving the optimal balance between learning plasticity and knowledge retention. We hypothesize that quantization-induced noise acts as implicit regularization, preventing the overfitting to new task gradients that plagues high-precision models. These findings challenge the conventional wisdom that higher precision is always preferable, suggesting instead that INT8 quantization offers both computational efficiency and superior continual learning dynamics. Our results provide practical guidelines for deploying compressed models in continual learning scenarios: small replay buffers (1-2%) suffice for NLU tasks, while Math and Code benefit from moderate buffers (5-10%), with quantized models requiring less replay than FP16 to achieve comparable retention.

However, most existing methods still rely on replaying data from previous stages to prevent catastrophic forgetting, which compromises privacy and limits their applicability in real-world scenarios where data transfer across sites is often restricted. In this work, we propose InvCoSS, an inversion-driven continual self-supervised learning framework for medical multi-modal image pre-training. Specifically, after training on a previous task, InvCoSS inverts the pre-trained self-supervised model to generate synthetic images that approximate the original training distribution. These synthetic images are then combined with data from the new task for joint optimization, which effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting while strictly adhering to the constraint of no access to previous real data. Furthermore, to improve the fidelity of synthetic images, we introduce a novel InvUNet with a multi-scale fusion architecture to restore both high- and low-frequency components of the inverted images. To enhance diversity and prevent mode collapse, we design a repulsive representation-learning mechanism that encourages a diverse feature space for synthetic images without class guidance. Extensive experiments across nine downstream tasks validate the effectiveness of InvCoSS, achieving performance comparable to or even superior to prior data-replay methods while significantly reducing storage requirements and eliminating data privacy constraints."}

To address this, we propose HippMetric, a skeletal representation (s-rep)-based framework for hippocampal substructural morphometry and point-wise correspondence across individuals and scans. HippMetric builds on the Axis-Referenced Morphometric Model (ARMM) and employs a deformable skeletal coordinate system aligned with hippocampal anatomy and function, providing a biologically grounded reference for correspondence. Our framework comprises two core modules: a skeletal-based coordinate system that respects the hippocampus' conserved longitudinal lamellar architecture, in which functional units (lamellae) are stacked perpendicular to the long-axis, enabling anatomically consistent localization across subjects and time; and individualized s-reps generated through surface reconstruction, deformation, and geometrically constrained spoke refinement, enforcing boundary adherence, orthogonality and non-intersection to produce mathematically valid skeletal geometry. Extensive experiments on two international cohorts demonstrate that HippMetric achieves higher accuracy, reliability, and correspondence stability compared to existing shape models."}

However, most existing applications are limited to identifying objects alone, without considering their associated states. The ability to recognize both the state and object simultaneously remains less common. One approach to address this is by treating state and object as a single category during training. However, this approach poses challenges in data collection and training since it requires comprehensive data for all possible combinations. Compositional Zero-shot Learning (CZSL) emerges as a viable solution by treating the state and object as distinct categories during training. CZSL facilitates the identification of novel compositions even in the absence of data for every conceivable combination. The current state-of-the-art method, KG-SP, addresses this issue by training distinct classifiers for states and objects, while leveraging a semantic model to evaluate the plausibility of composed compositions. However, KG-SP's accuracy in state and object recognition can be further improved, and it fails to consider the weighting of states and objects during composition. In this study, we propose SASOW, an enhancement of KG-SP that considers the weighting of states and objects while improving composition recognition accuracy. First, we introduce self-attention mechanisms into the classifiers for states and objects, leading to enhanced accuracy in recognizing both. Additionally, we incorporate the weighting of states and objects during composition to generate more reasonable and accurate compositions. Our validation process involves testing SASOW on three established benchmark datasets. Experimental outcomes affirm when compared against OW-CZSL approach, KG-SP, SASOW showcases improvements of 2.1%, 1.7%, and 0.4% in terms of accuracy for unseen compositions across the MIT-States, UT Zappos, and C-GQA datasets, respectively."}

We present CARE (Contrastive Anchored REflection), a failure-centric post-training framework for multimodal reasoning that turns errors into supervision. CARE combines: (i) an anchored-contrastive objective that forms a compact subgroup around the best rollout and a set of semantically proximate hard negatives, performs within-subgroup z-score normalization with negative-only scaling, and includes an all-negative rescue to prevent zero-signal batches; and (ii) Reflection-Guided Resampling (RGR), a one-shot structured self-repair that rewrites a representative failure and re-scores it with the same verifier, converting near-misses into usable positives without any test-time reflection. CARE improves accuracy and training smoothness while explicitly increasing the share of learning signal that comes from failures.

By representing each anatomically parcellated brain region as a visual token and encoding SNP profiles as structured text, the framework enables cross-modal attention that links regional atrophy patterns to underlying genetic factors. Applied to the ADNI cohort, R-GenIMA achieves state-of-the-art performance in four-way classification across normal cognition (NC), subjective memory concerns (SMC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD. Beyond predictive accuracy, the model yields biologically meaningful explanations by identifying stage-specific brain regions and gene signatures, as well as coherent ROI-Gene association patterns across the disease continuum. Attention-based attribution revealed genes consistently enriched for established GWAS-supported AD risk loci, including APOE, BIN1, CLU, and RBFOX1. Stage-resolved neuroanatomical signatures identified shared vulnerability hubs across disease stages alongside stage-specific patterns: striatal involvement in subjective decline, frontotemporal engagement during prodromal impairment, and consolidated multimodal network disruption in AD.

To this end, we introduce ICP-4D, a simple yet effective training-free framework that unifies spatial and temporal reasoning through geometric relations among instance-level point sets. Specifically, we apply the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm to directly associate temporally consistent instances by aligning the source and target point sets through the estimated transformation.

Neural operator (NO) surrogates offer fast inference across parametric and functional inputs; however, most autoregressive NO frameworks remain vulnerable to compounding errors, and ensemble-averaged metrics provide limited guarantees for individual inference trajectories. In practice, error accumulation can become unacceptable beyond the training horizon, and existing methods lack mechanisms for online monitoring or correction. To address this gap, we propose ANCHOR (Adaptive Numerical Correction for High-fidelity Operator Rollouts), an online, instance-aware hybrid inference framework for stable long-horizon prediction of nonlinear, time-dependent PDEs. ANCHOR treats a pretrained NO as the primary inference engine and adaptively couples it with a classical numerical solver using a physics-informed, residual-based error estimator. Inspired by adaptive time-stepping in numerical analysis, ANCHOR monitors an exponential moving average (EMA) of the normalized PDE residual to detect accumulating error and trigger corrective solver interventions without requiring access to ground-truth solutions. We show that the EMA-based estimator correlates strongly with the true relative L2 error, enabling data-free, instance-aware error control during inference. Evaluations on four canonical PDEs: 1D and 2D Burgers', 2D Allen-Cahn, and 3D heat conduction, demonstrate that ANCHOR reliably bounds long-horizon error growth, stabilizes extrapolative rollouts, and significantly improves robustness over standalone neural operators, while remaining substantially more efficient than high-fidelity numerical solvers."}

We further fine-tune the planner with Group Relative Policy Optimization, yielding shorter edit trajectories (3.1 versus 4.2 steps) and stronger alignment.

Most existing acceleration methods focus on traversing this generative trajectory more efficiently via improved solvers or sampling strategies. We advance a complementary perspective: shorten the trajectory itself by starting closer to the target distribution through context-aware initialization.\n  We propose a training-free interface that injects prompt-conditioned priors from a lightweight auxiliary model into the diffusion initialization, and instantiate it with two mechanisms: discrete token injection and representation-level embedding interpolation. Because injected priors can be imperfect and unmask-only decoding can over-commit early, we also introduce a simple confidence-based remasking mechanism as a form of prior skepticism. Preliminary evidence on GSM8K suggests that context-aware initialization can substantially reduce denoising iterations (about 35\\% fewer function evaluations in our setting), while also exposing a key open challenge: naive warm-starting can degrade final accuracy relative to strong diffusion baselines. We use these findings to motivate a research agenda around calibration, revision mechanisms, and representation alignment for reliable warm-started diffusion decoding."}

Understanding how policy evolves across layers and modules is therefore crucial for enabling more targeted optimization and raveling out complex reasoning mechanisms. In this paper, we decompose the language model policy by leveraging the intrinsic split of the Transformer residual stream and the equivalence between the composition of hidden states with the unembedding matrix and the resulting samplable policy. This decomposition reveals Internal Layer Policies, corresponding to contributions from individual layers, and Internal Modular Policies, which align with the self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN) components within each layer. By analyzing the entropy of internal policy, we find that: (a) Early layers keep high entropy for exploration, top layers converge to near-zero entropy for refinement, with convergence patterns varying across model series. (b) LLama's prediction space rapidly converges in the final layer, whereas Qwen-series models, especially Qwen3, exhibit a more human-like, progressively structured reasoning pattern. Motivated by these findings, we propose Bottom-up Policy Optimization (BuPO), a novel RL paradigm that directly optimizes the internal layer policy during early training. By aligning training objective at lower layer, BuPO reconstructs foundational reasoning capabilities and achieves superior performance. Extensive experiments on complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/Trae1ounG/BuPO."}

Evaluating Gait Biometric Fidelity in Generative AI Human Animation", "comment": null, "summary": "Generative AI (GenAI) models have revolutionized animation, enabling the synthesis of humans and motion patterns with remarkable visual fidelity. However, generating truly realistic human animation remains a formidable challenge, where even minor inconsistencies can make a subject appear unnatural. This limitation is particularly critical when AI-generated videos are evaluated for behavioral biometrics, where subtle motion cues that define identity are easily lost or distorted. The present study investigates whether state-of-the-art GenAI human animation models can preserve the subtle spatio-temporal details needed for person identification through gait biometrics. Specifically, we evaluate four different GenAI models across two primary evaluation tasks to assess their ability to i) restore gait patterns from reference videos under varying conditions of complexity, and ii) transfer these gait patterns to different visual identities. Our results show that while visual quality is mostly high, biometric fidelity remains low in tasks focusing on identification, suggesting that current GenAI models struggle to disentangle identity from motion. Furthermore, through an identity transfer task, we expose a fundamental flaw in appearance-based gait recognition: when texture is disentangled from motion, identification collapses, proving current GenAI models rely on visual attributes rather than temporal dynamics."}

For Reasoning Multimodal Large Language Models (RMLLMs), this is uniquely challenging: intermediate chain-of-thought steps can still leak sensitive information even when final answers are forgotten, and overly aggressive interventions easily damage general reasoning ability. Yet no benchmark jointly evaluates how well unlearning methods suppress reasoning-level leakage while preserving reasoning competence. We address this gap with RMLLMU-Bench, the first benchmark for RMLLM unlearning that extends standard forgetting metrics with dedicated measures of reasoning leakage and reasoning retention. A systematic evaluation on RMLLMU-Bench reveals that existing unlearning methods for MLLMs and Large (Language) Reasoning Models (LRMs) either leave substantial leakage in the reasoning process or severely degrade reasoning performance. To address these gaps, we propose R-MUSE (Reasoning-preserving MLLM Unlearning via Subspace guidance and Adaptive Steering), a training-free and inference-time intervention framework that steers internal representations to forget both answers and reasoning traces while explicitly preserving general reasoning. Experiments on RMLLMU-Bench demonstrate that R-MUSE achieves a substantially better balance between effective forgetting and reasoning retention."}

Prior approaches mainly rely on head trajectories, leading to ambiguity, or assume continuously tracked hands, which is unrealistic for lightweight egocentric devices. In this work, we present HaMoS, the first hand-aware, sequence-level diffusion framework that directly conditions on both head trajectory and intermittently visible hand cues caused by field-of-view limitations and occlusions, as in real-world egocentric devices. To overcome the lack of datasets pairing diverse camera views with human motion, we introduce a novel augmentation method that models such real-world conditions. We also demonstrate that sequence-level contexts such as body shape and field-of-view are crucial for accurate motion reconstruction, and thus employ local attention to infer long sequences efficiently. Experiments on public benchmarks show that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and temporal smoothness, demonstrating a practical step toward reliable in-the-wild egocentric 3D motion understanding."}

Given a reference image (e.g., one's pet), we expect the generated image to retain precise details attached to the subject's identity. However, current generative evaluation metrics emphasize the overall semantic similarity between the reference and the output, and overlook these fine-grained discriminative details. We introduce Finer-Personalization Rank, an evaluation protocol tailored to identity preservation. Instead of pairwise similarity, Finer-Personalization Rank adopts a ranking view: it treats each generated image as a query against an identity-labeled gallery consisting of visually similar real images. Retrieval metrics (e.g., mean average precision) measure performance, where higher scores indicate that identity-specific details (e.g., a distinctive head spot) are preserved. We assess identity at multiple granularities -- from fine-grained categories (e.g., bird species, car models) to individual instances (e.g., re-identification). Across CUB, Stanford Cars, and animal Re-ID benchmarks, Finer-Personalization Rank more faithfully reflects identity retention than semantic-only metrics and reveals substantial identity drift in several popular personalization methods. These results position the gallery-based protocol as a principled and practical evaluation for personalized generation."}

To address these limitations, we propose Reinforcement Mixing Learning (RMLer), a framework that formulates cross-category concept fusion as a reinforcement learning problem: mixed features serve as states, mixing strategies as actions, and visual outcomes as rewards. Specifically, we design an MLP-policy network to predict dynamic coefficients for blending cross-category text embeddings. We further introduce visual rewards based on (1) semantic similarity and (2) compositional balance between the fused object and its constituent concepts, optimizing the policy via proximal policy optimization. At inference, a selection strategy leverages these rewards to curate the highest-quality fused objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate RMLer's superiority in synthesizing coherent, high-fidelity objects from diverse categories, outperforming existing methods. Our work provides a robust framework for generating novel visual concepts, with promising applications in film, gaming, and design."}

Our method distinguishes between \\emph{hard links} (high-confidence identity relationships such as phone numbers, credit cards, and national IDs) and \\emph{soft links} (behavioral associations including device fingerprints, cookies, and IP addresses). We introduce a graph transformation technique that first identifies connected components via hard links, merges them into super-nodes, and then reconstructs a weighted soft-link graph amenable to efficient embedding and clustering. The transformed graph is processed using LINE (Large-scale Information Network Embedding) for representation learning, followed by HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) for density-based cluster discovery. Experiments on a real-world payment platform dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves significant graph size reduction (from 25 million to 7.7 million nodes), doubles the detection coverage compared to hard-link-only baselines, and maintains high precision across identified fraud clusters.

Supervised contrastive approaches based on the InfoNCE loss suffer from negative-sample dilution and lack adaptive decision boundaries, thereby reducing discriminative power in fine-grained recognition tasks. To address these limitations, we propose Sigmoid-based Common and Style Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCS-SupCon). Our framework introduces a sigmoid-based pairwise contrastive loss with learnable temperature and bias parameters to enable adaptive decision boundaries. This formulation emphasizes hard negatives, mitigates negative-sample dilution, and more effectively exploits supervision. In addition, an explicit style-distance constraint further disentangles style and content representations, leading to more robust feature learning. Comprehensive experiments on six benchmark datasets, including CUB200-2011 and Stanford Dogs, demonstrate that SCS-SupCon achieves state-of-the-art performance across both CNN and Transformer backbones. On CIFAR-100 with ResNet-50, SCS-SupCon improves top-1 accuracy over SupCon by approximately 3.9 percentage points and over CS-SupCon by approximately 1.7 points under five-fold cross-validation. On fine-grained datasets, it outperforms CS-SupCon by 0.4--3.0 points. Extensive ablation studies and statistical analyses further confirm the robustness and generalization of the proposed framework, with Friedman tests and Nemenyi post-hoc evaluations validating the stability of the observed improvements."}

We present a novel training approach, named MixFlow, for improving the performance. Our approach is motivated by the Slow Flow phenomenon: the ground-truth interpolation that is the nearest to the generated noisy data at a given sampling timestep is observed to correspond to a higher-noise timestep (termed slowed timestep), i.e., the corresponding ground-truth timestep is slower than the sampling timestep. MixFlow leverages the interpolations at the slowed timesteps, named slowed interpolation mixture, for post-training the prediction network for each training timestep.

Achieving sub-minute orchestration of renewables, storage, and loads, while minimizing PUE and lifecycle carbon intensity, hinges on accurate load forecasting. However, existing methods struggle to address small-sample scenarios caused by cold start, load distortion, multi-source data fragmentation, and distribution shifts in green data centers. We introduce HyperLoad, a cross-modality framework that exploits pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to overcome data scarcity. In the Cross-Modality Knowledge Alignment phase, textual priors and time-series data are mapped to a common latent space, maximizing the utility of prior knowledge. In the Multi-Scale Feature Modeling phase, domain-aligned priors are injected through adaptive prefix-tuning, enabling rapid scenario adaptation, while an Enhanced Global Interaction Attention mechanism captures cross-device temporal dependencies. The public DCData dataset is released for benchmarking. Under both data sufficient and data scarce settings, HyperLoad consistently surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, demonstrating its practicality for sustainable green data center management."}

The conventional approach to address this involves a two-stage pipeline: an OCR system extracts text from handwritten images, which is then translated into the target language using a machine translation model. In this work, we explore and compare the performance of traditional OCR-MT pipelines with Vision Large Language Models that aim to unify these stages and directly translate handwritten text images in a single, end-to-end step. Our motivation is grounded in the urgent need for scalable, accurate translation systems to digitize legal records such as FIRs, charge sheets, and witness statements in India's district and high courts. We evaluate both approaches on a curated dataset of handwritten Marathi legal documents, with the goal of enabling efficient legal document processing, even in low-resource environments. Our findings offer actionable insights toward building robust, edge-deployable solutions that enhance access to legal information for non-native speakers and legal professionals alike."}

While neural implicit functions have previously been applied to this task, their application to mapping anatomical consistency across subjects has been limited. In this work, we introduce Neural Implicit Heart Coordinates (NIHCs), a standardized implicit coordinate system, based on universal ventricular coordinates, that provides a common anatomical reference frame for the human heart. Our method predicts NIHCs directly from a limited number of 2D segmentations (sparse acquisition) and subsequently decodes them into dense 3D segmentations and high-resolution meshes at arbitrary output resolution. Trained on a large dataset of 5,000 cardiac meshes, the model achieves high reconstruction accuracy on clinical contours, with mean Euclidean surface errors of 2.51$\\pm$0.33 mm in a diseased cohort (n=4549) and 2.3$\\pm$0.36 mm in a healthy cohort (n=5576). The NIHC representation enables anatomically coherent reconstruction even under severe slice sparsity and segmentation noise, faithfully recovering complex structures such as the valve planes. Compared with traditional pipelines, inference time is reduced from over 60 s to 5-15 s. These results demonstrate that NIHCs constitute a robust and efficient anatomical representation for patient-specific 3D cardiac reconstruction from minimal input data."}

A key challenge experienced in these more realistic domains is highly non-Markovian dependencies with respect to the agent's observations, which are less common in small controlled domains. The predominant approach for dealing with this in the literature is to stack together a window of the most recent observations (Frame Stacking), but this window size must grow with the degree of non-Markovian dependencies, which results in prohibitive computational and memory requirements for both action inference and learning. In this paper, we are motivated by the insight that in many environments that are highly non-Markovian with respect to time, the environment only causally depends on a relatively small number of observations over that time-scale. A natural direction would then be to consider meta-algorithms that maintain relatively small adaptive stacks of memories such that it is possible to express highly non-Markovian dependencies with respect to time while considering fewer observations at each step and thus experience substantial savings in both compute and memory requirements. Hence, we propose a meta-algorithm (Adaptive Stacking) for achieving exactly that with convergence guarantees and quantify the reduced computation and memory constraints for MLP, LSTM, and Transformer-based agents. Our experiments utilize popular memory tasks, which give us control over the degree of non-Markovian dependencies. This allows us to demonstrate that an appropriate meta-algorithm can learn the removal of memories not predictive of future rewards without excessive removal of important experiences.

OpenTTGames is a set of recordings from the side of the table with official labels for bounces, when the ball is above the net, or hitting the net. The dataset already contains ball coordinates near events, which are either \"bounce\", \"net\", or \"empty_event\" in the original OpenTTGames dataset, and semantic masks (humans, table, scoreboard). Our extension adds the types of stroke to the events and a per-player taxonomy so models can move beyond event spotting toward tactical understanding (e.g., whether a stroke is likely to win the point or set up an advantage). We provide a compact coding scheme and code-assisted labeling procedure to support reproducible annotations and baselines for fine-grained stroke understanding in racket sports.

We present a multimodal formulation of hybrid learning and propose a cross attention mid fusion architecture in which a classical representation queries quantum derived feature tokens through an attention block with residual connectivity. The quantum branch is kept within practical NISQ budgets and uses up to nine qubits. We evaluate on Wine, Breast Cancer, Forest CoverType, FashionMNIST, and SteelPlatesFaults, comparing a quantum only model, a classical baseline, residual hybrid models, and the proposed mid fusion model under a consistent protocol. Pure quantum and standard hybrid designs underperform due to measurement induced information loss, while cross attention mid fusion is consistently competitive and improves performance on the more complex datasets in most cases.

The framework integrates: (i) a standardized curation and annotation pipeline linking each CT with organ masks and nodule-level annotations, (ii) a ControlNet-conditioned rectified-flow generator built on MAISI-v2's foundational blocks to enforce anatomy- and lesion-consistent synthesis, and (iii) lesion-aware augmentation that perturbs nodule masks (controlled shrinkage) while preserving surrounding anatomy to generate paired CT variants. Results: Across six public test datasets, NodMAISI improved distributional fidelity relative to MAISI-v2 (real-to-synthetic FID range 1.18 to 2.99 vs 1.69 to 5.21). In lesion detectability analysis using a MONAI nodule detector, NodMAISI substantially increased average sensitivity and more closely matched clinical scans (IMD-CT: 0.69 vs 0.39; DLCS24: 0.63 vs 0.20), with the largest gains for sub-centimeter nodules where MAISI-v2 frequently failed to reproduce the conditioned lesion.

However, the scale and heterogeneity of WSIs generate highly redundant and dispersed information, making it difficult to identify and integrate discriminative signals. Existing MIL methods either fail to discard uninformative cues effectively or have limited ability to consolidate relevant features from multiple patches, which restricts their performance on large and heterogeneous WSIs. To address this issue, we propose DeltaMIL, a novel MIL framework that explicitly selects semantically relevant regions and integrates the discriminative information from WSIs. Our method leverages the gated delta rule to efficiently filter and integrate information through a block combining forgetting and memory mechanisms. The delta mechanism dynamically updates the memory by removing old values and inserting new ones according to their correlation with the current patch. The gating mechanism further enables rapid forgetting of irrelevant signals. Additionally, DeltaMIL integrates a complementary local pattern mixing mechanism to retain fine-grained pathological locality. Our design enhances the extraction of meaningful cues and suppresses redundant or noisy information, which improves the model's robustness and discriminative power. Experiments demonstrate that DeltaMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, for survival prediction, DeltaMIL improves performance by 3.69\\% using ResNet-50 features and 2.36\\% using UNI features. For slide-level classification, it increases accuracy by 3.09\\% with ResNet-50 features and 3.75\\% with UNI features.

To demonstrate the critical role of temporal structure in this task, we introduce Temporal Alignment Event Graph (TAEG), a graph structure that explicitly models chronology and event alignment. By applying a standard centrality algorithm to TAEG, our method functions as a version selection mechanism, choosing the most central representation of each event in its correct temporal position. In a study on the four Biblical Gospels, this structure-focused approach guarantees perfect temporal ordering (Kendall's Tau of 1.000) by design and dramatically improves content metrics (e.g., +357.2% in ROUGE-L F1).

For both tasks, training is performed with a batch size of 8 using two separate AdamW optimizers for the generator and discriminator, each equipped with a warmup and cosine decay scheduler, with learning rates of $5\\times10^{-4}$ and $1\\times10^{-3}$, respectively. Data preprocessing includes deformable registration, foreground cropping, percentile normalization for the input modality, and linear normalization of the CT to the range $[-1024, 1000]$.

FOODER operates using low-cost frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar and exploits both range-Doppler and micro range-Doppler representations. The authentication module employs a multi-encoder multi-decoder architecture with Body Part (BP) and Intermediate Linear Encoder-Decoder (ILED) components to classify a single enrolled individual as in-distribution while detecting all other faces as OOD. Upon successful authentication, an expression recognition module is activated. Concatenated radar representations are processed by a ResNet block to distinguish between dynamic and static facial expressions. Based on this categorization, two specialized MobileViT networks are used to classify dynamic expressions (smile, shock) and static expressions (neutral, anger). This hierarchical design enables robust facial authentication and fine-grained expression recognition while preserving user privacy by relying exclusively on radar data. Experiments conducted on a dataset collected with a 60 GHz short-range FMCW radar demonstrate that FOODER achieves an AUROC of 94.13% and an FPR95 of 18.12% for authentication, along with an average expression recognition accuracy of 94.70%.

Fixed-precision quantization struggles to handle outlier channels in the key cache, while current mixed-precision strategies fail to accurately identify components requiring high-precision representation.

However, ANNs rely on dense computation, which results in high power consumption. In contrast, spiking neural networks (SNNs), which benefit from spike-driven computation, inherently provide low power consumption. Regrettably, the potential of SNNs for DVGL has yet to be thoroughly investigated. Meanwhile, the inherent sparsity of spike-driven computation for representation learning scenarios also results in loss of critical information and difficulties in learning long-range dependencies when aligning heterogeneous visual data sources. To address these, we propose SpikeViMFormer, the first SNN framework designed for DVGL. In this framework, a lightweight spike-driven transformer backbone is adopted to extract coarse-grained features. To mitigate the loss of critical information, the spike-driven selective attention (SSA) block is designed, which uses a spike-driven gating mechanism to achieve selective feature enhancement and highlight discriminative regions. Furthermore, a spike-driven hybrid state space (SHS) block is introduced to learn long-range dependencies using a hybrid state space. Moreover, only the backbone is utilized during the inference stage to reduce computational cost. To ensure backbone effectiveness, a novel hierarchical re-ranking alignment learning (HRAL) strategy is proposed. It refines features via neighborhood re-ranking and maintains cross-batch consistency to directly optimize the backbone.

While algorithms such as Network Dissection and CLIP-Dissect achieve great empirical success, a rigorous theoretical foundation remains absent, which is crucial to enable trustworthy and reliable explanations. In this work, we observe that neuron identification can be viewed as the inverse process of machine learning, which allows us to derive guarantees for neuron explanations. Based on this insight, we present the first theoretical analysis of two fundamental challenges: (1) Faithfulness: whether the identified concept faithfully represents the neuron's underlying function and (2) Stability: whether the identification results are consistent across probing datasets. We derive generalization bounds for widely used similarity metrics (e.g. accuracy, AUROC, IoU) to guarantee faithfulness, and propose a bootstrap ensemble procedure that quantifies stability along with BE (Bootstrap Explanation) method to generate concept prediction sets with guaranteed coverage probability. Experiments on both synthetic and real data validate our theoretical results and demonstrate the practicality of our method, providing an important step toward trustworthy neuron identification."}

Despite recent advances, current methods suffer from two critical challenges: prediction jitter across consecutive frames and poor discrimination of ambiguous phases. This paper aims to develop a stable framework by selectively propagating reliable historical information and explicitly modeling uncertainty for hard sample enhancement.\n  Methods: We propose a dual-pathway framework DSTED with Reliable Memory Propagation (RMP) and Uncertainty-Aware Prototype Retrieval (UPR). RMP maintains temporal coherence by filtering and fusing high-confidence historical features through multi-criteria reliability assessment. UPR constructs learnable class-specific prototypes from high-uncertainty samples and performs adaptive prototype matching to refine ambiguous frame representations. Finally, a confidence-driven gate dynamically balances both pathways based on prediction certainty.\n  Results: Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on AutoLaparo-hysterectomy with 84.36% accuracy and 65.51% F1-score, surpassing the second-best method by 3.51% and 4.88% respectively. Ablations reveal complementary gains from RMP (2.19%) and UPR (1.93%), with synergistic effects when combined.

This study proposes a three stage pipeline that transforms street view imagery (SVI) into structured representations for predicting six perceptual indicators. In the first stage, each image is parsed using an open-set Panoptic Scene Graph model (OpenPSG) to extract object predicate object triplets. In the second stage, compact scene-level embeddings are learned through a heterogeneous graph autoencoder (GraphMAE). In the third stage, a neural network predicts perception scores from these embeddings. We evaluate the proposed approach against image-only baselines in terms of accuracy, precision, and cross-city generalization. Results indicate that (i) our approach improves perception prediction accuracy by an average of 26% over baseline models, and (ii) maintains strong generalization performance in cross-city prediction tasks. Additionally, the structured representation clarifies which relational patterns contribute to lower perception scores in urban scenes, such as graffiti on wall and car parked on sidewalk. Overall, this study demonstrates that graph-based structure provides expressive, generalizable, and interpretable signals for modelling urban perception, advancing human-centric and context-aware urban analytics."}

Furthermore, what social features of stigmas are associated with bias in LLM outputs is unknown. From psychology literature, it has been shown that stigmas contain six shared social features: aesthetics, concealability, course, disruptiveness, origin, and peril. In this study, we investigate if human and LLM ratings of the features of stigmas, along with prompt style and type of stigma, have effect on bias towards stigmatized groups in LLM outputs. We measure bias against 93 stigmatized groups across three widely used LLMs (Granite 3.0-8B, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B) using SocialStigmaQA, a benchmark that includes 37 social scenarios about stigmatized identities; for example deciding wether to recommend them for an internship. We find that stigmas rated by humans to be highly perilous (e.g., being a gang member or having HIV) have the most biased outputs from SocialStigmaQA prompts (60% of outputs from all models) while sociodemographic stigmas (e.g. Asian-American or old age) have the least amount of biased outputs (11%). We test if the amount of biased outputs could be decreased by using guardrail models, models meant to identify harmful input, using each LLM's respective guardrail model (Granite Guardian 3.0, Llama Guard 3.0, Mistral Moderation API). We find that bias decreases significantly by 10.4%, 1.4%, and 7.8%, respectively. However, we show that features with significant effect on bias remain unchanged post-mitigation and that guardrail models often fail to recognize the intent of bias in prompts.

To address this, we propose dMLLM-TTS, a novel framework operating on two complementary scaling axes: (1) trajectory exploration scaling to enhance the diversity of generated hypotheses, and (2) iterative refinement scaling for stable generation. Conventional TTS approaches typically perform linear search across these two dimensions, incurring substantial computational costs of O(NT) and requiring an external verifier for best-of-N selection. To overcome these limitations, we propose two innovations. First, we design an efficient hierarchical search algorithm with O(N+T) complexity that adaptively expands and prunes sampling trajectories. Second, we introduce a self-verified feedback mechanism that leverages the dMLLMs' intrinsic image understanding capabilities to assess text-image alignment, eliminating the need for external verifier.

Conversely, existing training-free methods avoid these issues but rely on surface-level prompting, failing to provide the fine-grained atom-level priors essential for precise chemical reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce ChemATP, a framework that decouples chemical knowledge from the reasoning engine. By constructing the first atom-level textual knowledge base, ChemATP enables frozen LLMs to explicitly retrieve and reason over this information dynamically. This architecture ensures interpretability and adaptability while preserving the LLM's intrinsic general intelligence. Experiments show that ChemATP significantly outperforms training-free baselines and rivals state-of-the-art training-based models, demonstrating that explicit prior injection is a competitive alternative to implicit parameter updates."}

This design lacks explicit collaboration, leaving no structured mechanism for the embedder to incorporate decoding-aware cues or for the extractor to guide embedding during training. To address this architectural limitation, we rethink deep image watermarking by reformulating embedding and extraction as explicitly collaborative components. To realize this reformulation, we introduce a Collaborative Interaction Mechanism (CIM) that establishes direct, bidirectional communication between the embedder and extractor, enabling a mutual-teacher training paradigm and coordinated optimization. Built upon this explicitly collaborative architecture, we further propose an Adaptive Feature Modulation Module (AFMM) to support effective interaction. AFMM enables content-aware feature regulation by decoupling modulation structure and strength, guiding watermark embedding toward stable image features while suppressing host interference during extraction. Under CIM, the AFMMs on both sides form a closed-loop collaboration that aligns embedding behavior with extraction objectives. This architecture-level redesign changes how robustness is learned in watermarking systems. Rather than relying on exhaustive distortion simulation, robustness emerges from coordinated representation learning between embedding and extraction. Experiments on real-world and AI-generated datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in watermark extraction accuracy while maintaining high perceptual quality, showing strong robustness and generalization."}

This paper addresses the problem of digitizing mosaics by segmenting the tesserae to separate them from the background within the broader field of Image Segmentation in Computer Vision. We propose a method leveraging Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) by Meta AI, a foundation model that outperforms most conventional segmentation models, to automatically segment mosaics.

Quantitative evaluation on our testing dataset shows notable improvements compared to the baseline SAM 2 model, with Intersection over Union increasing from 89.00% to 91.02% and Recall from 92.12% to 95.89%. Additionally, on a benchmark proposed by a prior approach, our model achieves an F-measure 3% higher than previous methods and reduces the error in the absolute difference between predicted and actual tesserae from 0.20 to just 0.02.

To address this, we introduce D2Pruner, a framework that rectifies these issues by uniquely combining debiased importance with a structural pruning mechanism. Our method first secures a core set of the most critical tokens as pivots based on a debiased attention score. It then performs a Maximal Independent Set (MIS) selection on the remaining tokens, which are modeled on a hybrid graph where edges signify spatial proximity and semantic similarity. This process iteratively preserves the most important and available token while removing its neighbors, ensuring that the supplementary tokens are chosen to maximize importance and diversity.

The present study investigates whether state-of-the-art GenAI human animation models can preserve the subtle spatio-temporal details needed for person identification through gait biometrics. Specifically, we evaluate four different GenAI models across two primary evaluation tasks to assess their ability to i) restore gait patterns from reference videos under varying conditions of complexity, and ii) transfer these gait patterns to different visual identities. Our results show that while visual quality is mostly high, biometric fidelity remains low in tasks focusing on identification, suggesting that current GenAI models struggle to disentangle identity from motion. Furthermore, through an identity transfer task, we expose a fundamental flaw in appearance-based gait recognition: when texture is disentangled from motion, identification collapses, proving current GenAI models rely on visual attributes rather than temporal dynamics."}

Owing to the importance of emotion in advertising, emotion-oriented image generation has attracted increasing attention. However, current emotion-oriented methods suffer from an affective shortcut, where emotions are approximated to semantics. As evidenced by two decades of research, emotion is not equivalent to semantics. To this end, we propose Emotion-Director, a cross-modal collaboration framework consisting of two modules. First, we propose a cross-Modal Collaborative diffusion model, abbreviated as MC-Diffusion. MC-Diffusion integrates visual prompts with textual prompts for guidance, enabling the generation of emotion-oriented images beyond semantics. Further, we improve the DPO optimization by a negative visual prompt, enhancing the model's sensitivity to different emotions under the same semantics. Second, we propose MC-Agent, a cross-Modal Collaborative Agent system that rewrites textual prompts to express the intended emotions. To avoid template-like rewrites, MC-Agent employs multi-agents to simulate human subjectivity toward emotions, and adopts a chain-of-concept workflow that improves the visual expressiveness of the rewritten prompts. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of Emotion-Director in emotion-oriented image generation."}

Traditional data-driven methods require extensive labeled fault data, which is often impractical to obtain, while model-based approaches suffer from parameter uncertainties. This paper proposes a digital twin (DT)-driven zero-shot fault diagnosis framework utilizing fluid-borne noise (FBN) signals. The framework calibrates a high-fidelity DT model using only healthy-state data, generates synthetic fault signals for training deep learning classifiers, and employs a physics-informed neural network (PINN) as a virtual sensor for flow ripple estimation. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) is integrated to visualize the decision-making process of neural networks, revealing that large kernels matching the subsequence length in time-domain inputs and small kernels in time-frequency domain inputs enable higher diagnostic accuracy by focusing on physically meaningful features. Experimental validations demonstrate that training on signals from the calibrated DT model yields diagnostic accuracies exceeding 95\\% on real-world benchmarks, while uncalibrated models result in significantly lower performance, highlighting the framework's effectiveness in data-scarce scenarios."}

Since DMIR processes two images simultaneously as input, the combination relationships between features has grown exponentially, ultimately the model considers more interfering features during the feature modeling process. Introducing dynamics in the receptive fields and weights of the network enable the model to eliminate the interfering features combination and model the potential feature combination relationships. In this paper, we propose the Dynamic Stream Network (DySNet), which enables the receptive fields and weights to be dynamically adjusted. This ultimately enables the model to ignore interfering feature combinations and model the potential feature relationships. With two key innovations: 1) Adaptive Stream Basin (AdSB) module dynamically adjusts the shape of the receptive field, thereby enabling the model to focus on the feature relationships with greater correlation. 2) Dynamic Stream Attention (DySA) mechanism generates dynamic weights to search for more valuable feature relationships.

We present a novel training approach, named MixFlow, for improving the performance. Our approach is motivated by the Slow Flow phenomenon: the ground-truth interpolation that is the nearest to the generated noisy data at a given sampling timestep is observed to correspond to a higher-noise timestep (termed slowed timestep), i.e., the corresponding ground-truth timestep is slower than the sampling timestep. MixFlow leverages the interpolations at the slowed timesteps, named slowed interpolation mixture, for post-training the prediction network for each training timestep. Experiments over class-conditional image generation (including SiT, REPA, and RAE) and text-to-image generation validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our approach MixFlow over the RAE models achieve strong generation results on ImageNet: 1.43 FID (without guidance) and 1.10 (with guidance) at 256 x 256, and 1.55 FID (without guidance) and 1.10 (with guidance) at 512 x 512."}

These models, however, depend on large, high-quality ground-truth datasets to achieve robust performance and generalization. Furthermore, the growing variety of SAR satellites operating at different frequencies and spatial resolutions has amplified the need for more annotated datasets to enhance model accuracy. To address this, we present the NovaSAR Automated Ship Target Recognition (NASTaR) dataset.

In particular, approaches that prioritise direct thermal cues struggle to capture indirect yet persistent environmental alterations induced by sustained heat emissions.\n  This work introduces a physics-aware representation learning framework that leverages multi-spectral information to model stable signatures of long-term physical processes. Specifically, a geological Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) ratio sensitive to soil property changes is integrated with Thermal Infrared (TIR) data through an intermediate fusion architecture, instantiated as FusionNet. The proposed backbone embeds trainable differential signal-processing priors within convolutional layers, combines mixed pooling strategies, and employs wider receptive fields to enhance robustness across spectral modalities.\n  Systematic ablations show that each architectural component contributes to performance gains, with DGCNN achieving 88.7% accuracy on the SWIR ratio and FusionNet reaching 90.6%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines across five spectral configurations. Transfer learning experiments further show that ImageNet pretraining degrades TIR performance, highlighting the importance of modality-aware training for cross-spectral learning.\n  Evaluated on real-world data, the results demonstrate that combining physics-aware feature selection with principled deep learning architectures yields robust and generalisable representations, illustrating how first-principles signal modelling can improve multi-spectral learning under challenging conditions."}

Model merging aims to merge the distinct capabilities of these specialised models into a unified model, requiring minimal or even no additional training. A core objective of model merging is to ensure the merged model retains the behavioural characteristics of the specialised models, typically achieved through feature alignment. We identify that features consist of two critical components: direction and magnitude. Prior research has predominantly focused on directional alignment, while the influence of magnitude remains largely neglected, despite its pronounced vulnerability to perturbations introduced by common merging operations (e.g., parameter fusion and sparsification). Such perturbations to magnitude inevitably lead to feature deviations in the merged model from the specialised models, resulting in subsequent performance degradation. To address this, we propose MAGnItude Calibration (MAGIC), a plug-and-play framework that rectifies layer-wise magnitudes in feature and weight spaces, with three variants. Specifically, our Feature Space Calibration (FSC) realigns the merged model's features using a small set of unlabelled data, while Weight Space Calibration (WSC) extends this calibration to the weight space without requiring additional data. Combining these yields Dual Space Calibration (DSC). Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MAGIC consistently boosts performance across diverse Computer Vision tasks (+4.3% on eight datasets) and NLP tasks (+8.0% on Llama) without additional training.

Despite increasing emphasis on complex neural architectures, the empirical limits of text-only linguistic modeling remain underexplored. We present a systematic diagnostic evaluation of nine machine learning algorithms on the LIAR benchmark. By isolating lexical features (Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF) and semantic embeddings (GloVe), we uncover a hard \"Performance Ceiling\", with fine-grained classification not exceeding a Weighted F1-score of 0.32 across models. Crucially, a simple linear SVM (Accuracy: 0.624) matches the performance of pre-trained Transformers such as RoBERTa (Accuracy: 0.620), suggesting that model capacity is not the primary bottleneck. We further diagnose a massive \"Generalization Gap\" in tree-based ensembles, which achieve more than 99% training accuracy but collapse to approximately 25% on test data, indicating reliance on lexical memorization rather than semantic inference. Synthetic data augmentation via SMOTE yields no meaningful gains, confirming that the limitation is semantic (feature ambiguity) rather than distributional. These findings indicate that for political fact-checking, increasing model complexity without incorporating external knowledge yields diminishing returns."}

Anatomy understanding tasks demand precise understanding and clinically coherent answers, which are difficult to achieve due to the complexity of medical data and the scarcity of high-quality expert annotations. These challenges limit the effectiveness of conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategies. While recent work has demonstrated that Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) can enhance reasoning in MLLMs without relying on large amounts of data, we find two weaknesses that hinder GRPO's reasoning performance in anatomy recognition: 1) knowledge cannot be effectively shared between different anatomical structures, resulting in uneven information gain and preventing the model from converging, and 2) the model quickly converges to a single reasoning path, suppressing the exploration of diverse strategies. To overcome these challenges, we propose two novel methods. First, we implement a progressive learning strategy called Anatomical Similarity Curriculum Learning by controlling question difficulty via the similarity of answer choices, enabling the model to master complex problems incrementally. Second, we utilize question augmentation referred to as Group Diversity Question Augmentation to expand the model's search space for difficult queries, mitigating the tendency to produce uniform responses. Comprehensive experiments on the SGG-VQA and OmniMedVQA benchmarks show our method achieves a significant improvement across the two benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the medical reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. The code can be found in https://github.com/tomato996/Anatomy-R1"}

In this work, an alternative set of periodic functions is proposed for positional encoding. These functions preserve some key properties of sinusoidal ones, while they depart from them in fundamental ways. Some tentative experiments are reported, where the original sinusoidal version is substantially outperformed. This strongly suggests that the alternative functions may have a wider use in other transformer architectures."}

Beyond parameter efficiency with $O(LN + LG)$ scaling (where $G$ is the knot count of the shared splines) versus MLPs' $O(LN^2)$, SNs admit a sequential evaluation strategy that reduces peak forward-intermediate memory from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$ (treating batch size as constant), making much wider architectures feasible under memory constraints.

Most models of learning and inference, however, presuppose a fixed representational basis within which belief updating occurs. In this paper, I address a prior question: under what structural conditions can the representational basis itself expand in a principled and selective way?\n  I propose a geometric framework in which conceptual growth is modeled as admissible basis extension evaluated under a Minimum Description Length (MDL) criterion. Experience, whether externally observed or internally simulated, is represented as vectors relative to a current conceptual subspace. Residual components capture systematic representational failure, and candidate conceptual extensions are restricted to low-rank, admissible transformations. I show that any MDL-accepted extension can be chosen so that its novel directions lie entirely within the residual span induced by experience, while extensions orthogonal to this span strictly increase description length and are therefore rejected.\n  This yields a conservative account of imagination and conceptual innovation. Internally generated counterfactual representations contribute to learning only insofar as they expose or amplify structured residual error, and cannot introduce arbitrary novelty. I further distinguish representational counterfactuals--counterfactuals over an agent's conceptual basis--from causal or value-level counterfactuals, and show how MDL provides a normative selection principle governing representational change.\n  Overall, the framework characterizes conceptual development as an error-driven, geometry-constrained process of basis extension, clarifying both the role and the limits of imagination in learning and theory change."}

Finally, a confidence-driven gate dynamically balances both pathways based on prediction certainty.\n  Results: Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on AutoLaparo-hysterectomy with 84.36% accuracy and 65.51% F1-score, surpassing the second-best method by 3.51% and 4.88% respectively. Ablations reveal complementary gains from RMP (2.19%) and UPR (1.93%), with synergistic effects when combined. Extensive analysis confirms substantial reduction in temporal jitter and marked improvement on challenging phase transitions.\n  Conclusion: Our dual-pathway design introduces a novel paradigm for stable workflow recognition, demonstrating that decoupling the modeling of temporal consistency and phase ambiguity yields superior performance and clinical applicability."}

However, current open multimodal agents still largely fall short on the reasoning aspect crucial for real-world tasks like analyzing documents with dense charts/diagrams and navigating maps. To address this gap, we introduce O3-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal reasoning with interleaved attention to visual details. O3-Bench features challenging problems that require agents to piece together subtle visual information from distinct image areas through multi-step reasoning. The problems are highly challenging even for frontier systems like OpenAI o3, which only obtains 40.8% accuracy on O3-Bench. To make progress, we propose InSight-o3, a multi-agent framework consisting of a visual reasoning agent (vReasoner) and a visual search agent (vSearcher) for which we introduce the task of generalized visual search -- locating relational, fuzzy, or conceptual regions described in free-form language, beyond just simple objects or figures in natural images. We then present a multimodal LLM purpose-trained for this task via reinforcement learning. As a plug-and-play agent, our vSearcher empowers frontier multimodal models (as vReasoners), significantly improving their performance on a wide range of benchmarks. This marks a concrete step towards powerful o3-like open systems. Our code and dataset can be found at https://github.com/m-Just/InSight-o3 ."}

This allows text and image information to fully attend to one another within the model, but becomes extremely costly for high-resolution images, long conversations, or streaming videos, both in memory and compute. VLMs leveraging cross-attention are an efficient alternative to token insertion but exhibit a clear performance gap, in particular on tasks involving fine-grained visual details. We find that a key to improving such models is to also enable local text-to-text interaction in the dedicated cross-attention layers. Building on this, we propose CASA, Cross-Attention via Self-Attention, a simple and efficient paradigm which substantially reduces the gap with full token insertion on common image understanding benchmarks, while enjoying the same scalability as cross-attention models when applied to long-context multimodal tasks such as streaming video captioning.

We ask a basic question: when is such a dynamical system learnable from observations alone? This paper proposes a research program for understanding learnability in dynamical systems through the lens of next-token prediction. We argue that learnability in dynamical systems should be studied as a finite-sample question, and be based on the properties of the underlying dynamics rather than the statistical properties of the resulting sequence. To this end, we give a formulation of learnability for stochastic processes induced by dynamical systems, focusing on guarantees that hold uniformly at every time step after a finite burn-in period. This leads to a notion of dynamic learnability which captures how the structure of a system, such as stability, mixing, observability, and spectral properties, governs the number of observations required before reliable prediction becomes possible. We illustrate the framework in the case of linear dynamical systems, showing that accurate prediction can be achieved after finite observation without system identification, by leveraging improper methods based on spectral filtering. We survey the relationship between learning in dynamical systems and classical PAC, online, and universal prediction theories, and suggest directions for studying nonlinear and controlled systems."}

Inspired by human memory, we propose StoryMem, a paradigm that reformulates long-form video storytelling as iterative shot synthesis conditioned on explicit visual memory, transforming pre-trained single-shot video diffusion models into multi-shot storytellers. This is achieved by a novel Memory-to-Video (M2V) design, which maintains a compact and dynamically updated memory bank of keyframes from historical generated shots. The stored memory is then injected into single-shot video diffusion models via latent concatenation and negative RoPE shifts with only LoRA fine-tuning. A semantic keyframe selection strategy, together with aesthetic preference filtering, further ensures informative and stable memory throughout generation. Moreover, the proposed framework naturally accommodates smooth shot transitions and customized story generation applications.

We argue that standard multi-head attention is best seen as a form of tensor lifting: hidden vectors are mapped into a high-dimensional space of pairwise interactions, and learning proceeds by constraining this lifted tensor through gradient descent. This mechanism is extremely expressive but mathematically opaque, because after many layers it becomes very hard to describe the model with a small family of explicit invariants.\n  To explore an alternative, we propose an attention-free architecture based on Grassmann flows. Instead of forming an L by L attention matrix, our Causal Grassmann layer (i) linearly reduces token states, (ii) encodes local token pairs as two-dimensional subspaces on a Grassmann manifold via Plucker coordinates, and (iii) fuses these geometric features back into the hidden states through gated mixing. Information therefore propagates by controlled deformations of low-rank subspaces over multi-scale local windows, so the core computation lives on a finite-dimensional manifold rather than in an unstructured tensor space.\n  On the Wikitext-2 language modeling benchmark, purely Grassmann-based models with 13 to 18 million parameters achieve validation perplexities within about 10 to 15 percent of size-matched Transformers. On the SNLI natural language inference task, a Grassmann-Plucker head on top of DistilBERT slightly outperforms a Transformer head, with best validation and test accuracies of 0.8550 and 0.8538 compared to 0.8545 and 0.8511. We analyze the complexity of Grassmann mixing, show linear scaling in sequence length for fixed rank, and argue that such manifold-based designs offer a more structured route toward geometric and invariant-based interpretations of neural reasoning."}

We introduce CORE (Concept-Oriented REinforcement), an RL training framework that turns explicit concepts into a controllable supervision signal. Starting from a high-quality, low-contamination textbook resource that links verifiable exercises to concise concept descriptions, we run a sanity probe showing LLMs can restate definitions but fail concept-linked quizzes, quantifying the conceptual reasoning gap. CORE then (i) synthesizes concept-aligned quizzes, (ii) injects brief concept snippets during rollouts to elicit concept-primed trajectories, and (iii) reinforces conceptual reasoning via trajectory replacement after group failures, a lightweight forward-KL constraint that aligns unguided with concept-primed policies, or standard GRPO directly on concept-aligned quizzes. Across several models, CORE delivers consistent gains over vanilla and SFT baselines on both in-domain concept-exercise suites and diverse out-of-domain math benchmarks. CORE unifies direct training on concept-aligned quizzes and concept-injected rollouts under outcome regularization. It provides fine-grained conceptual supervision that bridges problem-solving competence and genuine conceptual reasoning, while remaining algorithm- and verifier-agnostic."}

Our approach introduces three core innovations: (1) Phase-Aware Cross-Attention (PACA), which decomposes prompts into a global base block and temporally-anchored phase blocks, enabling the model to concentrate on phase-relevant tokens for precise temporal-semantic alignment; (2) Progressive Audio-Visual Alignment, which aligns modality influence with the hierarchical feature learning process-early layers prioritize text for establishing action structure while deeper layers emphasize audio for refining lip movements, preventing modality interference; (3) A two-stage training strategy that first establishes robust audio-visual correspondence on diverse data, then injects action control through fine-tuning on structured annotations, maintaining both audio-visual alignment and the model's text-following capabilities.

This design lacks explicit collaboration, leaving no structured mechanism for the embedder to incorporate decoding-aware cues or for the extractor to guide embedding during training. To address this architectural limitation, we rethink deep image watermarking by reformulating embedding and extraction as explicitly collaborative components. To realize this reformulation, we introduce a Collaborative Interaction Mechanism (CIM) that establishes direct, bidirectional communication between the embedder and extractor, enabling a mutual-teacher training paradigm and coordinated optimization. Built upon this explicitly collaborative architecture, we further propose an Adaptive Feature Modulation Module (AFMM) to support effective interaction. AFMM enables content-aware feature regulation by decoupling modulation structure and strength, guiding watermark embedding toward stable image features while suppressing host interference during extraction. Under CIM, the AFMMs on both sides form a closed-loop collaboration that aligns embedding behavior with extraction objectives. This architecture-level redesign changes how robustness is learned in watermarking systems. Rather than relying on exhaustive distortion simulation, robustness emerges from coordinated representation learning between embedding and extraction. Experiments on real-world and AI-generated datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in watermark extraction accuracy while maintaining high perceptual quality, showing strong robustness and generalization."}

To address scarce and uncontrolled expressive data, we perform cross-age expression transfer, adapting expressions from adult 3D scans to enrich infant datasets with realistic and systematic expressive variants. As a result, BabyFlow improves 3D reconstruction accuracy, particularly in highly expressive regions such as the mouth, eyes, and nose, and supports synthesis and modification of infant expressions while preserving identity. Additionally, by integrating with diffusion models, BabyFlow generates high-fidelity 2D infant images with consistent 3D geometry, providing powerful tools for data augmentation and early facial analysis."}

Specifically, we used activations to fit probes and further analyzed the effects of different models and input content of LLMs on this discriminative power. By computing the directions of essays across various trait dimensions under different prompts, we analyzed the variation in evaluation perspectives of large language models concerning essay types and traits.

However, this abundance of tabular attributes does not reflect real-world datasets, where only a subset of attributes may be available.

To address this challenge, we propose RoVTL (Robust Vision-Tabular Learning), a framework designed to handle any level of tabular data availability, from 0% to 100%. RoVTL comprises two key stages: contrastive pretraining, where we introduce tabular attribute missingness as data augmentation to promote robustness, and downstream task tuning using a gated cross-attention module for multimodal fusion. During fine-tuning, we employ a novel Tabular More vs. Fewer loss that ranks performance based on the amount of available tabular data. Combined with disentangled gradient learning, this enables consistent performance across all tabular data completeness scenarios. We evaluate RoVTL on cardiac MRI scans from the UK Biobank, demonstrating superior robustness to missing tabular data compared to prior methods. Furthermore, RoVTL successfully generalizes to an external cardiac MRI dataset for multimodal disease classification, and extends to the natural images domain, achieving robust performance on a car advertisements dataset.

To address this, we introduce a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline that leverages synthetic map images and pixel-level parsing to automatically produce precise annotations for this challenging task. Using this pipeline, we construct a fine-tuning dataset of 23k path samples across 4k maps, enabling models to acquire more human-like spatial capabilities. Using this dataset, we fine-tune both open-source and proprietary MLLMs. Results on MapBench show that finetuning substantially improves robustness, raising success rates by up to 6.4 points, while also reducing path-tracing error (NDTW).

Leveraging these OR-derived decisions as foundational training labels, we design a domain-informed deep learning foundation model to establish foundational decision-making capabilities, followed by a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning stage.

Evaluation using Inception Score, Frechet Inception Distance, and downstream phenotype classification shows that synthetic images effectively augment training data and improve accuracy. Second, we bridge the gap between high resolution indoor datasets and limited outdoor imagery using DreamBooth-based text inversion and image guided diffusion, generating translated images that enhance weed detection and classification with YOLOv8.

To date, long-term and accurate MJO prediction has remained a challenge for researchers. Conventional MJO prediction methods using Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) are resource-intensive, time-consuming, and highly unstable (most NWP methods are sensitive to seasons, with better MJO forecast results in winter). While existing Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods save resources and speed forecasting, their accuracy never reaches the 28 days predicted by the state-of-the-art NWP method, i.e., the operational forecasts from ECMWF, since neural networks cannot handle climate data effectively. In this paper, we present a Domain Knowledge Embedded Spatio-Temporal Network (DK-STN), a stable neural network model for accurate and efficient MJO forecasting. It combines the benefits of NWP and ANN methods and successfully improves the forecast accuracy of ANN methods while maintaining a high level of efficiency and stability. We begin with a spatial-temporal network (STN) and embed domain knowledge in it using two key methods: (i) applying a domain knowledge enhancement method and (ii) integrating a domain knowledge processing method into network training. We evaluated DK-STN with the 5th generation of ECMWF reanalysis (ERA5) data and compared it with ECMWF. Given 7 days of climate data as input, DK-STN can generate reliable forecasts for the following 28 days in 1-2 seconds, with an error of only 2-3 days in different seasons. DK-STN significantly exceeds ECMWF in that its forecast accuracy is equivalent to ECMWF's, while its efficiency and stability are significantly superior."}

Most existing acceleration methods focus on traversing this generative trajectory more efficiently via improved solvers or sampling strategies. We advance a complementary perspective: shorten the trajectory itself by starting closer to the target distribution through context-aware initialization.\n  We propose a training-free interface that injects prompt-conditioned priors from a lightweight auxiliary model into the diffusion initialization, and instantiate it with two mechanisms: discrete token injection and representation-level embedding interpolation. Because injected priors can be imperfect and unmask-only decoding can over-commit early, we also introduce a simple confidence-based remasking mechanism as a form of prior skepticism. Preliminary evidence on GSM8K suggests that context-aware initialization can substantially reduce denoising iterations (about 35\\% fewer function evaluations in our setting), while also exposing a key open challenge: naive warm-starting can degrade final accuracy relative to strong diffusion baselines. We use these findings to motivate a research agenda around calibration, revision mechanisms, and representation alignment for reliable warm-started diffusion decoding."}

Anatomy understanding tasks demand precise understanding and clinically coherent answers, which are difficult to achieve due to the complexity of medical data and the scarcity of high-quality expert annotations. These challenges limit the effectiveness of conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategies. While recent work has demonstrated that Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) can enhance reasoning in MLLMs without relying on large amounts of data, we find two weaknesses that hinder GRPO's reasoning performance in anatomy recognition: 1) knowledge cannot be effectively shared between different anatomical structures, resulting in uneven information gain and preventing the model from converging, and 2) the model quickly converges to a single reasoning path, suppressing the exploration of diverse strategies. To overcome these challenges, we propose two novel methods. First, we implement a progressive learning strategy called Anatomical Similarity Curriculum Learning by controlling question difficulty via the similarity of answer choices, enabling the model to master complex problems incrementally. Second, we utilize question augmentation referred to as Group Diversity Question Augmentation to expand the model's search space for difficult queries, mitigating the tendency to produce uniform responses. Comprehensive experiments on the SGG-VQA and OmniMedVQA benchmarks show our method achieves a significant improvement across the two benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the medical reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. The code can be found in https://github.com/tomato996/Anatomy-R1"}

While general-domain vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) perform well on natural image tasks, they struggle in medical domain applications, particularly in cross-modal retrieval for ophthalmological images. We propose a novel knowledge-enhanced joint embedding framework that integrates retinal fundus images, clinical text, and structured patient data through a multimodal transformer architecture to address the critical gap in medical image-text alignment. Our approach employs separate encoders for each modality: a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) for retinal images, Bio-ClinicalBERT for clinical narratives, and a multilayer perceptron for structured demographic and clinical features. These modalities are fused through a joint transformer with modality-specific embeddings, trained using multiple objectives including contrastive losses between modality pairs, reconstruction losses for images and text, and classification losses for DR severity grading according to ICDR and SDRG schemes. Experimental results on the Brazilian Multilabel Ophthalmological Dataset (BRSET) demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models. Our framework achieves near-perfect text-to-image retrieval performance with Recall@1 of 99.94% compared to fine-tuned CLIP's 1.29%, while maintaining state-of-the-art classification accuracy of 97.05% for SDRG and 97.97% for ICDR. Furthermore, zero-shot evaluation on the unseen DeepEyeNet dataset validates strong generalizability with 93.95% Recall@1 versus 0.22% for fine-tuned CLIP.

Super-resolution (SR) can enhance resolution post-scan, yet existing deep learning methods face fidelity-efficiency trade-offs. Purpose: To develop a computationally efficient and accurate deep learning framework for MRI SR that preserves anatomical detail for clinical integration. Materials and Methods: We propose a novel SR framework combining multi-head selective state-space models (MHSSM) with a lightweight channel MLP. The model uses 2D patch extraction with hybrid scanning to capture long-range dependencies. Each MambaFormer block integrates MHSSM, depthwise convolutions, and gated channel mixing. Evaluation used 7T brain T1 MP2RAGE maps (n=142) and 1.5T prostate T2w MRI (n=334). Comparisons included Bicubic interpolation, GANs (CycleGAN, Pix2pix, SPSR), transformers (SwinIR), Mamba (MambaIR), and diffusion models (I2SB, Res-SRDiff). Results: Our model achieved superior performance with exceptional efficiency. For 7T brain data: SSIM=0.951+-0.021, PSNR=26.90+-1.41 dB, LPIPS=0.076+-0.022, GMSD=0.083+-0.017, significantly outperforming all baselines (p<0.001).

VLMs leveraging cross-attention are an efficient alternative to token insertion but exhibit a clear performance gap, in particular on tasks involving fine-grained visual details. We find that a key to improving such models is to also enable local text-to-text interaction in the dedicated cross-attention layers.

This disconnect causes current methods to struggle with occluded areas and complex camera trajectories. To bridge this gap, we propose WorldWarp, a framework that couples a 3D structural anchor with a 2D generative refiner. To establish geometric grounding, WorldWarp maintains an online 3D geometric cache built via Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). By explicitly warping historical content into novel views, this cache acts as a structural scaffold, ensuring each new frame respects prior geometry. However, static warping inevitably leaves holes and artifacts due to occlusions. We address this using a Spatio-Temporal Diffusion (ST-Diff) model designed for a \"fill-and-revise\" objective. Our key innovation is a spatio-temporal varying noise schedule: blank regions receive full noise to trigger generation, while warped regions receive partial noise to enable refinement. By dynamically updating the 3D cache at every step, WorldWarp maintains consistency across video chunks. Consequently, it achieves state-of-the-art fidelity by ensuring that 3D logic guides structure while diffusion logic perfects texture.

We present CARE (Contrastive Anchored REflection), a failure-centric post-training framework for multimodal reasoning that turns errors into supervision.

However, tokenizers are trained to reconstruct clean images from ground-truth tokens, while AR generators are optimized only for token likelihood. This misalignment leads to generated token sequences that may decode into low-quality images, without direct supervision from the pixel space. We propose VA-$π$, a lightweight post-training framework that directly optimizes AR models with a principled pixel-space objective. VA-$π$ formulates the generator-tokenizer alignment as a variational optimization, deriving an evidence lower bound (ELBO) that unifies pixel reconstruction and autoregressive modeling. To optimize under the discrete token space, VA-$π$ introduces a reinforcement-based alignment strategy that treats the AR generator as a policy, uses pixel-space reconstruction quality as its intrinsic reward. The reward is measured by how well the predicted token sequences can reconstruct the original image under teacher forcing, giving the model direct pixel-level guidance without expensive free-running sampling. The regularization term of the ELBO serves as a natural regularizer, maintaining distributional consistency of tokens. VA-$π$ enables rapid adaptation of existing AR generators, without neither tokenizer retraining nor external reward models.

As a result, BabyFlow improves 3D reconstruction accuracy, particularly in highly expressive regions such as the mouth, eyes, and nose, and supports synthesis and modification of infant expressions while preserving identity. Additionally, by integrating with diffusion models, BabyFlow generates high-fidelity 2D infant images with consistent 3D geometry, providing powerful tools for data augmentation and early facial analysis."}

Furthermore, what social features of stigmas are associated with bias in LLM outputs is unknown. From psychology literature, it has been shown that stigmas contain six shared social features: aesthetics, concealability, course, disruptiveness, origin, and peril. In this study, we investigate if human and LLM ratings of the features of stigmas, along with prompt style and type of stigma, have effect on bias towards stigmatized groups in LLM outputs. We measure bias against 93 stigmatized groups across three widely used LLMs (Granite 3.0-8B, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B) using SocialStigmaQA, a benchmark that includes 37 social scenarios about stigmatized identities; for example deciding wether to recommend them for an internship. We find that stigmas rated by humans to be highly perilous (e.g., being a gang member or having HIV) have the most biased outputs from SocialStigmaQA prompts (60% of outputs from all models) while sociodemographic stigmas (e.g. Asian-American or old age) have the least amount of biased outputs (11%). We test if the amount of biased outputs could be decreased by using guardrail models, models meant to identify harmful input, using each LLM's respective guardrail model (Granite Guardian 3.0, Llama Guard 3.0, Mistral Moderation API). We find that bias decreases significantly by 10.4%, 1.4%, and 7.8%, respectively. However, we show that features with significant effect on bias remain unchanged post-mitigation and that guardrail models often fail to recognize the intent of bias in prompts. This work has implications for using LLMs in scenarios involving stigmatized groups and we suggest future work towards improving guardrail models for bias mitigation."}

Existing benchmarks fall short of diagnosing this limitation: they either focus on overly simplified qualitative reasoning or rely on domain-specific indoor data, constrained by the lack of outdoor datasets with verifiable metric ground truth. To bridge this gap, we introduce a large-scale benchmark built from pedestrian-perspective videos captured with synchronized stereo cameras, LiDAR, and IMU/GPS sensors. This dataset provides metrically precise 3D information, enabling the automatic generation of spatial reasoning questions that span a hierarchical spectrum--from qualitative relational reasoning to quantitative metric and kinematic understanding. Evaluations reveal that the performance gains observed in structured indoor benchmarks vanish in open-world settings. Further analysis using synthetic abnormal scenes and blinding tests confirms that current MLLMs depend heavily on linguistic priors instead of grounded visual reasoning. Our benchmark thus provides a principled platform for diagnosing these limitations and advancing physically grounded spatial intelligence."}

To address this, we introduce a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline that leverages synthetic map images and pixel-level parsing to automatically produce precise annotations for this challenging task. Using this pipeline, we construct a fine-tuning dataset of 23k path samples across 4k maps, enabling models to acquire more human-like spatial capabilities. Using this dataset, we fine-tune both open-source and proprietary MLLMs. Results on MapBench show that finetuning substantially improves robustness, raising success rates by up to 6.4 points, while also reducing path-tracing error (NDTW). These gains highlight that fine-grained spatial reasoning, absent in pretrained models, can be explicitly taught with synthetic supervision."}

Unlike prior approaches that treat generation and validation as separate stages, VIGOR+ establishes an iterative feedback mechanism: validation signals from CEVAE (including information gain, latent consistency metrics, and diagnostic messages) are transformed into natural language feedback that guides subsequent LLM generation rounds. This iterative refinement continues until convergence criteria are met. We formalize the feedback mechanism, prove convergence properties under mild assumptions, and provide a complete algorithmic framework."}

The problem of generalization has been addressed formally in classical planning where provable correct policies that generalize over all instances of a given domain have been learned using combinatorial methods. The aim of this work is to bring these two research threads together to illuminate the conditions under which (deep) reinforcement learning approaches, and in particular, policy optimization methods, can be used to learn policies that generalize like combinatorial methods do. We draw on lessons learned from previous combinatorial and deep learning approaches, and extend them in a convenient way. From the former, we model policies as state transition classifiers, as (ground) actions are not general and change from instance to instance. From the latter, we use graph neural networks (GNNs) adapted to deal with relational structures for representing value functions over planning states, and in our case, policies. With these ingredients in place, we find that actor-critic methods can be used to learn policies that generalize almost as well as those obtained using combinatorial approaches while avoiding the scalability bottleneck and the use of feature pools. Moreover, the limitations of the DRL methods on the benchmarks considered have little to do with deep learning or reinforcement learning algorithms, and result from the well-understood expressive limitations of GNNs, and the tradeoff between optimality and generalization (general policies cannot be optimal in some domains). Both of these limitations are addressed without changing the basic DRL methods by adding derived predicates and an alternative cost structure to optimize."}

However, it is observed that the current thinking process during generation mainly focuses on the text consistency with the text prompt, ignoring the \\textbf{visual context consistency} with the visual reference images during the multi-modal generation, e.g., multi-reference generation. The lack of such consistency results in the failure in maintaining key visual features (like human ID, object attribute, style). To this end, we integrate the visual context consistency into the reasoning of unified models, explicitly motivating the model to sustain such consistency by 1) Adaptive Visual Planning: generating structured visual check list to figure out the visual element of needed consistency keeping, and 2) Iterative Visual Correction: performing self-reflection with the guidance of check lists and refining the generated result in an iterative manner. To achieve this, we use supervised finetuning to teach the model how to plan the visual checking, conduct self-reflection and self-refinement, and use flow-GRPO to further enhance the visual consistency through a customized visual checking reward. The experiments show that our method outperforms both zero-shot unified models and those with text CoTs in multi-modal generation, demonstrating higher visual context consistency."}

While general-domain vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) perform well on natural image tasks, they struggle in medical domain applications, particularly in cross-modal retrieval for ophthalmological images. We propose a novel knowledge-enhanced joint embedding framework that integrates retinal fundus images, clinical text, and structured patient data through a multimodal transformer architecture to address the critical gap in medical image-text alignment. Our approach employs separate encoders for each modality: a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) for retinal images, Bio-ClinicalBERT for clinical narratives, and a multilayer perceptron for structured demographic and clinical features. These modalities are fused through a joint transformer with modality-specific embeddings, trained using multiple objectives including contrastive losses between modality pairs, reconstruction losses for images and text, and classification losses for DR severity grading according to ICDR and SDRG schemes. Experimental results on the Brazilian Multilabel Ophthalmological Dataset (BRSET) demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models. Our framework achieves near-perfect text-to-image retrieval performance with Recall@1 of 99.94% compared to fine-tuned CLIP's 1.29%, while maintaining state-of-the-art classification accuracy of 97.05% for SDRG and 97.97% for ICDR. Furthermore, zero-shot evaluation on the unseen DeepEyeNet dataset validates strong generalizability with 93.95% Recall@1 versus 0.22% for fine-tuned CLIP.

Conventional visualization of velocity or pressure fields, however, provides limited insight into the coherent mechanisms driving these dynamics. Reduced-order modeling techniques, like Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Autoencoder (AE) architectures, offer powerful alternatives to extract dominant flow features from complex datasets. This study systematically compares POD with several AE variants (Linear, Nonlinear, Convolutional, and Variational) using left ventricular flow fields obtained from computational fluid dynamics simulations. We show that, for a suitably chosen latent dimension, AEs produce modes that become nearly orthogonal and qualitatively resemble POD modes that capture a given percentage of kinetic energy. As the number of latent modes increases, AE modes progressively lose orthogonality, leading to linear dependence, spatial redundancy, and the appearance of repeated modes with substantial high-frequency content. This degradation reduces interpretability and introduces noise-like components into AE-based reduced-order models, potentially complicating their integration with physics-based formulations or neural-network surrogates. The extent of interpretability loss varies across the AEs, with nonlinear, convolutional, and variational models exhibiting distinct behaviors in orthogonality preservation and feature localization. Overall, the results indicate that AEs can reproduce POD-like coherent structures under specific latent-space configurations, while highlighting the need for careful mode selection to ensure physically meaningful representations of cardiac flow dynamics."}

Additionally, current diffusion-based approaches generate entire motion sequences simultaneously, limiting their ability to capture the reactive and adaptive nature of human interactions. To address these limitations, we introduce Interact2Ar, the first end-to-end text-conditioned autoregressive diffusion model for generating full-body, human-human interactions. Interact2Ar incorporates detailed hand kinematics through dedicated parallel branches, enabling high-fidelity full-body generation.

The adaptability of our model enables a series of downstream applications, including temporal motion composition, real-time adaptation to disturbances, and extension beyond dyadic to multi-person scenarios.

Understanding how policy evolves across layers and modules is therefore crucial for enabling more targeted optimization and raveling out complex reasoning mechanisms. In this paper, we decompose the language model policy by leveraging the intrinsic split of the Transformer residual stream and the equivalence between the composition of hidden states with the unembedding matrix and the resulting samplable policy. This decomposition reveals Internal Layer Policies, corresponding to contributions from individual layers, and Internal Modular Policies, which align with the self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN) components within each layer. By analyzing the entropy of internal policy, we find that: (a) Early layers keep high entropy for exploration, top layers converge to near-zero entropy for refinement, with convergence patterns varying across model series. (b) LLama's prediction space rapidly converges in the final layer, whereas Qwen-series models, especially Qwen3, exhibit a more human-like, progressively structured reasoning pattern. Motivated by these findings, we propose Bottom-up Policy Optimization (BuPO), a novel RL paradigm that directly optimizes the internal layer policy during early training.

This heuristic finding offers a unifying perspective that ties encoder behavior to its underlying spectral structure. We define it as the Prism Hypothesis, where each data modality can be viewed as a projection of the natural world onto a shared feature spectrum, just like the prism. Building on this insight, we propose Unified Autoencoding (UAE), a model that harmonizes semantic structure and pixel details via an innovative frequency-band modulator, enabling their seamless coexistence.

To bridge this gap, we propose WorldWarp, a framework that couples a 3D structural anchor with a 2D generative refiner. To establish geometric grounding, WorldWarp maintains an online 3D geometric cache built via Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). By explicitly warping historical content into novel views, this cache acts as a structural scaffold, ensuring each new frame respects prior geometry. However, static warping inevitably leaves holes and artifacts due to occlusions. We address this using a Spatio-Temporal Diffusion (ST-Diff) model designed for a \"fill-and-revise\" objective. Our key innovation is a spatio-temporal varying noise schedule: blank regions receive full noise to trigger generation, while warped regions receive partial noise to enable refinement. By dynamically updating the 3D cache at every step, WorldWarp maintains consistency across video chunks. Consequently, it achieves state-of-the-art fidelity by ensuring that 3D logic guides structure while diffusion logic perfects texture.

To address this training efficiency-stability trade-off, we introduce $\\textbf{MSSR}$ (Multimodal Stabilized Single-Rollout), a group-free RLVR framework that achieves both stable optimization and effective multimodal reasoning performance. MSSR achieves this via an entropy-based advantage-shaping mechanism that adaptively regularizes advantage magnitudes, preventing collapse and maintaining training stability. While such mechanisms have been used in group-based RLVR, we show that in the multimodal single-rollout setting they are not merely beneficial but essential for stability. In in-distribution evaluations, MSSR demonstrates superior training compute efficiency, achieving similar validation accuracy to the group-based baseline with half the training steps. When trained for the same number of steps, MSSR's performance surpasses the group-based baseline and shows consistent generalization improvements across five diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks.

We propose an agent-based framework for detecting drift and assessing its severity in multisite clinical AI systems. To evaluate its effectiveness, we simulate a multi-center environment for output-based drift detection, assigning each site a drift monitoring agent that performs batch-wise comparisons of model outputs against a reference distribution. We analyse several multi-center monitoring schemes, that differ in how the reference is obtained (site-specific, global, production-only and adaptive), alongside a centralized baseline. Results on real-world breast cancer imaging data using a pathological complete response prediction model shows that all multi-center schemes outperform centralized monitoring, with F1-score improvements up to 10.3% in drift detection. In the absence of site-specific references, the adaptive scheme performs best, with F1-scores of 74.3% for drift detection and 83.7% for drift severity classification.

We introduce NOVA (Numerical Optimization of Vandermonde Arithmetic), a discovery framework that breaks the decades old convention of integer interpolation. Treating Winograd point selection as a continuous optimization problem, NOVA searches the manifold R^n-1 via Evolution Strategy, snaps candidates to simple rationals, and guarantees correctness via symbolic verification.

However, when facing ambiguous natural language instructions (e.g., \"fetch the tool\" in a cluttered room), current agents often fail to balance the high cost of physical exploration against the cognitive cost of human interaction. They typically treat disambiguation as a passive perception problem, lacking the strategic reasoning to minimize total task execution costs. To bridge this gap, we propose ESearch-R1, a cost-aware embodied reasoning framework that unifies interactive dialogue (Ask), episodic memory retrieval (GetMemory), and physical navigation (Navigate) into a single decision process. We introduce HC-GRPO (Heterogeneous Cost-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization). Unlike traditional PPO which relies on a separate value critic, HC-GRPO optimizes the MLLM by sampling groups of reasoning trajectories and reinforcing those that achieve the optimal trade-off between information gain and heterogeneous costs (e.g., navigate time, and human attention). Extensive experiments in AI2-THOR demonstrate that ESearch-R1 significantly outperforms standard ReAct-based agents. It improves task success rates while reducing total operational costs by approximately 50\\%, validating the effectiveness of GRPO in aligning MLLM agents with physical world constraints."}

We introduce CycleChart, a consistency-based learning framework for bidirectional chart understanding and generation. CycleChart adopts a schema-centric formulation as a common interface across tasks. We construct a consistent multi-task dataset, where each chart sample includes aligned annotations for schema prediction, data parsing, and question answering. To learn cross-directional chart semantics, CycleChart introduces a generate-parse consistency objective: the model generates a chart schema from a table and a textual query, then learns to recover the schema and data from the generated chart, enforcing semantic alignment across directions. CycleChart achieves strong results on chart generation, chart parsing, and chart question answering, demonstrating improved cross-task generalization and marking a step toward more general chart understanding models."}

While MU has been extensively explored in classical deep learning, its behavior within variational quantum circuits (VQCs) and quantum-augmented architectures remains largely unexplored. First, we adapt a broad suite of unlearning methods to quantum settings, including gradient-based, distillation-based, regularization-based and certified techniques. Second, we introduce two new unlearning strategies tailored to hybrid models. Experiments across Iris, MNIST, and Fashion-MNIST, under both subset removal and full-class deletion, reveal that quantum models can support effective unlearning, but outcomes depend strongly on circuit depth, entanglement structure, and task complexity. Shallow VQCs display high intrinsic stability with minimal memorization, whereas deeper hybrid models exhibit stronger trade-offs between utility, forgetting strength, and alignment with retrain oracle. We find that certain methods, e.g. EU-k, LCA, and Certified Unlearning, consistently provide the best balance across metrics. These findings establish baseline empirical insights into quantum machine unlearning and highlight the need for quantum-aware algorithms and theoretical guarantees, as quantum machine learning systems continue to expand in scale and capability. We publicly release our code at: https://github.com/CrivoiCarla/HQML."}

Model merging aims to merge the distinct capabilities of these specialised models into a unified model, requiring minimal or even no additional training. A core objective of model merging is to ensure the merged model retains the behavioural characteristics of the specialised models, typically achieved through feature alignment. We identify that features consist of two critical components: direction and magnitude. Prior research has predominantly focused on directional alignment, while the influence of magnitude remains largely neglected, despite its pronounced vulnerability to perturbations introduced by common merging operations (e.g., parameter fusion and sparsification). Such perturbations to magnitude inevitably lead to feature deviations in the merged model from the specialised models, resulting in subsequent performance degradation. To address this, we propose MAGnItude Calibration (MAGIC), a plug-and-play framework that rectifies layer-wise magnitudes in feature and weight spaces, with three variants. Specifically, our Feature Space Calibration (FSC) realigns the merged model's features using a small set of unlabelled data, while Weight Space Calibration (WSC) extends this calibration to the weight space without requiring additional data. Combining these yields Dual Space Calibration (DSC). Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MAGIC consistently boosts performance across diverse Computer Vision tasks (+4.3% on eight datasets) and NLP tasks (+8.0% on Llama) without additional training.

We introduce a new, flexible family of KerJEPAs, self-supervised learning algorithms with kernel-based regularizers. One instance of this family corresponds to the recently-introduced LeJEPA Epps-Pulley regularizer which approximates a sliced maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) with a Gaussian prior and Gaussian kernel. By expanding the class of viable kernels and priors and computing the closed-form high-dimensional limit of sliced MMDs, we develop alternative KerJEPAs with a number of favorable properties including improved training stability and design flexibility."}
