Further\ninsights highlight the need for pragmatic model selection (including hybrid\napproaches and simpler methods where appropriate), rigorous attention to data\nquality (representativeness, drift, annotation), robust error mitigation\nstrategies involving human-in-the-loop validation and ongoing audits, and\nbuilding organizational AI literacy. These practical considerations,\ngeneralizable beyond cancer registries, provide guidance for healthcare\norganizations seeking to successfully implement AI/NLP solutions to enhance\ndata management processes and ultimately improve patient care and public health\noutcomes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u5728\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u90e8\u7f72NLP\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6311\u6218\u548c\u5173\u952e\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u660e\u786e\u4e1a\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f00\u53d1\u3001\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u5408\u4f5c\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e34\u5e8a\u6587\u6863\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u7597\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46NLP\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u9762\u4e34\u5b9e\u9645\u6311\u6218\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5206\u4eab\u5728BCCR\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65bdNLP\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6559\u8bad\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e1a\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u660e\u786e\u95ee\u9898\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f00\u53d1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u5408\u4f5c\u4e0e\u5171\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b9e\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u4e25\u683c\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u6210\u529f\u90e8\u7f72NLP\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7AI\u7d20\u517b\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u65bdAI/NLP\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u60a3\u8005\u62a4\u7406\u548c\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u6210\u679c\u3002"}}

In this work, we present a suite of 2D and 3D\nBoussinesq simulations that explore how bottom-driven convection penetrates\ninto a compositionally stratified region. Our results reveal two distinct\nregimes: a penetrative regime, where the convection zone steadily grows by\nentraining fluid from above, and a stalled regime, where growth halts and\ntransitions to overshooting convection. We extend classical entrainment theory\nby incorporating thermal and compositional diffusion and by deriving a modified\nentrainment law that predicts interface speeds in the weak-diffusion limit. We\nshow that convection stalls when the interface speed becomes comparable to the\ncompositional diffusion speed and validate the transition between behaviors\nacross a wide parameter space of Richardson and Lewis numbers. Such\ndiffusively-controlled stalling is unlikely to occur in stellar and planetary\ninteriors, where the Lewis number is typically large and compositional\ndiffusion is extremely slow. In these environments, compositional diffusion\nwill merely slow the growth of the convection zone and convective boundaries\nare expected to stall only in the presence of other curtailing mechanisms such\nas strong radiative diffusion or rapid rotation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e95\u90e8\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5bf9\u6d41\u5982\u4f55\u7a7f\u900f\u6210\u5206\u5206\u5c42\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7a7f\u900f\u548c\u505c\u6ede\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u5939\u5e26\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6d41\u533a\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u5206\u5c42\u5c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5bf9\u6052\u661f\u548c\u884c\u661f\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc72D\u548c3D Boussinesq\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u70ed\u548c\u6210\u5206\u6269\u6563\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u5939\u5e26\u5b9a\u5f8b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u6d41\u5728\u754c\u9762\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6210\u5206\u6269\u6563\u901f\u5ea6\u76f8\u5f53\u65f6\u505c\u6ede\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86Richardson\u548cLewis\u6570\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u6052\u661f\u548c\u884c\u661f\u5185\u90e8\uff0c\u6210\u5206\u6269\u6563\u6781\u6162\uff0c\u5bf9\u6d41\u8fb9\u754c\u505c\u6ede\u9700\u5176\u4ed6\u673a\u5236\u5982\u5f3a\u8f90\u5c04\u6269\u6563\u6216\u5feb\u901f\u65cb\u8f6c\u3002"}}

Only small\ndimensions of linear systems of equations are to be solved for every center in\nthe domain and hence this procedure is more reliable and efficient to solve\nlarge scale physical and engineering problems in complex domain. Laplace\ntransform is utilized for obtaining the equivalent time-independent equation in\nLaplace space and also valuable to handle time-fractional derivatives in the\nCaputo sense. Application of Laplace transform avoids the time steeping\nprocedure which commonly encounters the time instability issues. The solution\nto the transformed model is then obtained by computing the inversion of Laplace\ntransform with an appropriate contour in a complex space, which is approximated\nby trapezoidal rule with high accuracy.

By decomposing the dynamics into a set of\nmodes, each associated with a single frequency and a growth rate, DMD enables a\nnatural modal decomposition and dimensionality reduction of complex dynamical\nsystems. However, when DMD is applied to transient dynamics, even if a large\nnumber of modes are used, it remains difficult to interpret how these modes\ncontribute to the transient behavior. In this study, we propose a simple\nextension of DMD to overcome this limitation by introducing time-varying\namplitudes for the DMD modes based on sparsity and smoothness regularization.\nThis approach enables identification of dynamically significant modes and\nextraction of their transient activities, providing a more interpretable and\nfaithful representation of non-steady dynamics.

The PEARL study was the first large-scale, four-arm\nrandomized controlled trial to assess a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm,\ninformed by health behavior change theory, to personalize the content and\ntiming of PA nudges via a Fitbit app.\n  We enrolled and randomized 13,463 Fitbit users into four study arms: control,\nrandom, fixed, and RL. The control arm received no nudges. The other three arms\nreceived nudges from a bank of 155 nudges based on behavioral science\nprinciples. The random arm received nudges selected at random. The fixed arm\nreceived nudges based on a pre-set logic from survey responses about PA\nbarriers. The RL group received nudges selected by an adaptive RL algorithm. We\nincluded 7,711 participants in primary analyses (mean age 42.1, 86.3% female,\nbaseline steps 5,618.2).\n  We observed an increase in PA for the RL group compared to all other groups\nfrom baseline to 1 and 2 months.

At 2 months, the RL group sustained a significant increase compared\nto the control group (+210 steps, p=0.0122).

Applying INTIMA to Gemma-3, Phi-4, o3-mini,\nand Claude-4 reveals that companionship-reinforcing behaviors remain much more\ncommon across all models, though we observe marked differences between models.\nDifferent commercial providers prioritize different categories within the more\nsensitive parts of the benchmark, which is concerning since both appropriate\nboundary-setting and emotional support matter for user well-being. These\nfindings highlight the need for more consistent approaches to handling\nemotionally charged interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86INTIMA\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u966a\u4f34\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u666e\u904d\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u966a\u4f34\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u654f\u611f\u90e8\u5206\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u4e92\u52a8\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76AI\u966a\u4f34\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u60c5\u611f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5176\u6b63\u9762\u548c\u8d1f\u9762\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5305\u542b31\u79cd\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u548c368\u4e2a\u63d0\u793a\u7684INTIMA\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u966a\u4f34\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "Gemma-3\u3001Phi-4\u3001o3-mini\u548cClaude-4\u666e\u904d\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u966a\u4f34\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u654f\u611f\u90e8\u5206\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u4e92\u52a8\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u7528\u6237\u798f\u7949\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u8bbe\u5b9a\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u652f\u6301\u65b9\u9762\u3002"}}

Current deep learning-based methods\nhave made exciting progress on the OBS decipherment task, but existing\napproaches often ignore the intricate connections between glyphs and the\nsemantics of OBS. This results in limited generalization and interpretability,\nespecially when addressing zero-shot settings and undeciphered OBS. To this\nend, we propose an interpretable OBS decipherment method based on Large\nVision-Language Models, which synergistically combines radical analysis and\npictograph-semantic understanding to bridge the gap between glyphs and meanings\nof OBS. Specifically, we propose a progressive training strategy that guides\nthe model from radical recognition and analysis to pictographic analysis and\nmutual analysis, thus enabling reasoning from glyph to meaning. We also design\na Radical-Pictographic Dual Matching mechanism informed by the analysis\nresults, significantly enhancing the model's zero-shot decipherment\nperformance. To facilitate model training, we propose the Pictographic\nDecipherment OBS Dataset, which comprises 47,157 Chinese characters annotated\nwith OBS images and pictographic analysis texts.

This feature makes it an\nappealing candidate for simulations involving meshes with embedded interfaces\nand evolving geometries. However, the method can yield poorly conditioned\nstiffness matrices in such scenarios due to meshes having cut cells. We propose\na novel element agglomeration algorithm for the virtual element method to\naddress this issue. The agglomeration algorithm renders the VEM robust over\nplanar polygonal meshes, particularly on finite element meshes cut by immersed\ngeometries. The algorithm relies on the element stability ratio, which we\ndefine using the extreme eigenvalues of the element stiffness matrix. The\nresulting element agglomeration criterion is free from nebulous polygon quality\nmetrics and is defined independently of polygon shapes. The algorithm proceeds\niteratively and element-wise to maximize the minimum element stability ratio,\neven at the expense of degrading elements with better ratios. Crucially,\nelement agglomeration alters the number of elements, not the degree of freedom\ncount. The resulting method, which we label as CutVEM, retains node locations\nof cut elements unchanged, and yields discretizations that conform to embedded\ninterfaces. This, in turn, facilitates straightforward imposition of boundary\nconditions and interfacial constraints.

Many practical applications of LLMs, such as code completion and\nstructured data extraction, require adherence to syntactic constraints\nspecified by a formal language. Yet, due to their probabilistic nature, LLM\noutput is not guaranteed to adhere to such formal languages. Prior work has\nproposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to\nparticular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the\nemerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as\nthe generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address\nthis challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion\nmodels, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars.\nWe begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive\ninfilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a\nvalid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the\npreviously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding. We then\nreduce this problem to the task of deciding whether the intersection of the\ntarget language and a regular language is empty and present an efficient\nalgorithm to solve it for context-free languages.

However, current\nmultimodal fusion methods adopt the attention mechanism of Transformers to\nimplicitly learn the underlying correlation of multimodal features. As a\nresult, the multimodal model cannot capture the essential features of each\nmodality, making it difficult to comprehend complex structures and correlations\nof multimodal inputs. This paper introduces a novel Multimodal Attention-based\nNormalizing Flow (MANGO) approach\\footnote{The source code of this work will be\npublicly available.} to developing explicit, interpretable, and tractable\nmultimodal fusion learning. In particular, we propose a new Invertible\nCross-Attention (ICA) layer to develop the Normalizing Flow-based Model for\nmultimodal data. To efficiently capture the complex, underlying correlations in\nmultimodal data in our proposed invertible cross-attention layer, we propose\nthree new cross-attention mechanisms: Modality-to-Modality Cross-Attention\n(MMCA), Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (IMCA), and Learnable Inter-Modality\nCross-Attention (LICA). Finally, we introduce a new Multimodal Attention-based\nNormalizing Flow to enable the scalability of our proposed method to\nhigh-dimensional multimodal data.

To address this gap a novel benchmark HiFACT\ndataset is introduced with 1,500 realworld factual claims made by 28 Indian\nstate Chief Ministers in Hinglish, under a highly code-mixed low-resource\nsetting. Each claim is annotated with textual evidence and veracity labels. To\nevaluate this benchmark, a novel graphaware, retrieval-augmented fact-checking\nmodel is proposed that combines multilingual contextual encoding,\nclaim-evidence semantic alignment, evidence graph construction, graph neural\nreasoning, and natural language explanation generation. Experimental results\nshow that HiFACTMix outperformed accuracy in comparison to state of art\nmultilingual baselines models and provides faithful justifications for its\nverdicts. This work opens a new direction for multilingual, code-mixed, and\npolitically grounded fact verification research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u6df7\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982Hinglish\uff09\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6HiFACT\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u5355\u8bed\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u5370\u5ea6\u7b49\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5730\u533a\u7684\u653f\u6cbb\u8bdd\u8bed\uff0c\u800cHinglish\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4f7f\u5f97\u5f00\u53d1\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u5de5\u5177\u53d8\u5f97\u8feb\u5207\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86HiFACT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b1500\u6761Hinglish\u653f\u6cbb\u58f0\u660e\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u91ca\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHiFACTMix\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

All treatments were trained\nusing a custom EfficientNetV2-L architecture with enhanced fine-tuning and\ntransfer learning techniques.

Additionally, the\nweighted F1-score increased from 0.65 (on H0) to 1.00 (on H3-H4) signifying\nthat the addition of a small number of real images with a considerable volume\nof synthetic images improved model performance and generalizability.

One of the advantages of IGA is in the realm of thin shell analysis:\ndue to the arbitrary continuity of the spline basis, Kirchhoff-Love shells can\nbe modeled without the need to introduce unknowns for the mid-plane rotations,\nleading to a reduction in the number of unknowns. In this paper, we provide the\nbackground of an implementation of Isogeometric Kirchhoff--Love shells within\nthe Geometry + Simulation Modules (G+Smo). This paper accompanies multiple\nprevious publications and elaborates on the design of the software used in\nthese papers, rather than the novelty of the methods presented therein. The\npresented implementation provides patch coupling via penalty methods and\nunstructured splines, goal-oriented error estimators, several algorithms for\nstructural analysis and advanced algorithms for the modeling of wrinkling in\nhyperelastic membranes. These methods are all contained in three new modules in\nG+Smo: a module for Kirchhoff-Love shells, a module for structural analysis,\nand a module for unstructured spline constructions.

This scarcity -- driven by privacy concerns, data\nsensitivity, and the infrequency of real incidents -- renders conventional\nfine-tuning of detectors infeasible for most industrial settings.\n  We address this challenge by introducing a scalable framework centered on a\nhigh-quality synthetic data generation pipeline.

We show that our method\nis in line with the state of the art on CIFAR-10, achieving 93.50% AUROC and\n25.80% FPR95. Our method outperforms these methods on CIFAR-100 with 97.05%\nAUROC and 13.79% FPR95 and on ImageNet-200 with 92.55% AUROC and 33.55% FPR95\nacross four OOD datasets", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u8f93\u5165\u5230\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u9ad8\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u8ba1\u7b97\u8f93\u5165\u5230\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10\u3001CIFAR-100\u548cImageNet-200\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0cAUROC\u548cFPR95\u6307\u6807\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u589e\u5f3a\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

We used half of these\nresponses to fine-tune the two models on human-generated ratings, and tested\nthe fine-tuned models on the remaining half of AIHQ responses. Results showed\nthat model-generated ratings aligned with human ratings for both attributions\nof hostility and aggression responses, with fine-tuned models showing higher\nalignment. This alignment was consistent across ambiguous, intentional, and\naccidental scenario types, and replicated previous findings on group\ndifferences in attributions of hostility and aggression responses between TBI\nand HC groups. The fine-tuned models also generalized well to an independent\nnonclinical dataset.

Heterogeneous-Agent Trust Region\nPolicy Optimization (HATRPO) enforces per-agent trust region constraints using\nKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to stabilize training. However, assigning each\nagent the same KL threshold can lead to slow and locally optimal updates,\nespecially in heterogeneous settings. To address this limitation, we propose\ntwo approaches for allocating the KL divergence threshold across agents:\nHATRPO-W, a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based (KKT-based) method that optimizes\nthreshold assignment under global KL constraints, and HATRPO-G, a greedy\nalgorithm that prioritizes agents based on improvement-to-divergence ratio. By\nconnecting sequential policy optimization with constrained threshold\nscheduling, our approach enables more flexible and effective learning in\nheterogeneous-agent settings.

To address this, knowledge graph-based RAG methods have evolved\ntowards hierarchical structures, organizing knowledge into multi-level\nsummaries. However, these approaches still suffer from two critical,\nunaddressed challenges: high-level conceptual summaries exist as disconnected\n``semantic islands'', lacking the explicit relations needed for cross-community\nreasoning; and the retrieval process itself remains structurally unaware, often\ndegenerating into an inefficient flat search that fails to exploit the graph's\nrich topology. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LeanRAG, a framework\nthat features a deeply collaborative design combining knowledge aggregation and\nretrieval strategies. LeanRAG first employs a novel semantic aggregation\nalgorithm that forms entity clusters and constructs new explicit relations\namong aggregation-level summaries, creating a fully navigable semantic network.\nThen, a bottom-up, structure-guided retrieval strategy anchors queries to the\nmost relevant fine-grained entities and then systematically traverses the\ngraph's semantic pathways to gather concise yet contextually comprehensive\nevidence sets. The LeanRAG can mitigate the substantial overhead associated\nwith path retrieval on graphs and minimizes redundant information retrieval.\nExtensive experiments on four challenging QA benchmarks with different domains\ndemonstrate that LeanRAG significantly outperforming existing methods in\nresponse quality while reducing 46\\% retrieval redundancy.

In figure skating, accurately recognizing\nthe type and timing of jumps a skater performs is essential for objective\nperformance evaluation. However, this task typically requires expert-level\nknowledge due to the fine-grained and complex nature of jump procedures. While\nrecent approaches have attempted to automate this task using Temporal Action\nSegmentation (TAS), there are two major limitations to TAS for figure skating:\nthe annotated data is insufficient, and existing methods do not account for the\ninherent three-dimensional aspects and procedural structure of jump actions. In\nthis work, we propose a new TAS framework for figure skating jumps that\nexplicitly incorporates both the three-dimensional nature and the semantic\nprocedure of jump movements. First, we propose a novel View-Invariant, Figure\nSkating-Specific pose representation learning approach (VIFSS) that combines\ncontrastive learning as pre-training and action classification as fine-tuning.\nFor view-invariant contrastive pre-training, we construct FS-Jump3D, the first\npublicly available 3D pose dataset specialized for figure skating jumps.\nSecond, we introduce a fine-grained annotation scheme that marks the ``entry\n(preparation)'' and ``landing'' phases, enabling TAS models to learn the\nprocedural structure of jumps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves over 92% F1@50 on\nelement-level TAS, which requires recognizing both jump types and rotation\nlevels.

AKI stems from complex\nhemodynamic, inflammatory, and metabolic changes, making early detection\nessential. Many predictive tools lack accuracy, interpretability, and alignment\nwith intensive care unit (ICU) workflows. This study developed an interpretable\nmachine learning model for early AKI prediction in critically ill patients with\ncirrhosis.\n  Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database,\nidentifying 1240 adult ICU patients with cirrhosis and excluding those with ICU\nstays under 48 hours or missing key data. Laboratory and physiological\nvariables from the first 48 hours were extracted. The pipeline included\npreprocessing, missingness filtering, LASSO feature selection, and SMOTE class\nbalancing. Six algorithms-LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, logistic regression,\nnaive Bayes, and neural networks-were trained and evaluated using AUROC,\naccuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.\n  Results: LightGBM achieved the best performance (AUROC 0.808, 95% CI\n0.741-0.856; accuracy 0.704; NPV 0.911). Key predictors included prolonged\npartial thromboplastin time, absence of outside-facility 20G placement, low pH,\nand altered pO2, consistent with known cirrhosis-AKI mechanisms and suggesting\nactionable targets.\n  Conclusion: The LightGBM-based model enables accurate early AKI risk\nstratification in ICU patients with cirrhosis using routine clinical variables.\nIts high negative predictive value supports safe de-escalation for low-risk\npatients, and interpretability fosters clinician trust and targeted prevention.\nExternal validation and integration into electronic health record systems are\nwarranted.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u809d\u786c\u5316\u91cd\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u6025\u6027\u80be\u635f\u4f24\uff08AKI\uff09\uff0cLightGBM\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u809d\u786c\u5316\u60a3\u8005AKI\u53d1\u751f\u7387\u9ad8\u4e14\u9884\u540e\u5dee\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u878d\u5165ICU\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u56de\u987e\u6027\u5206\u6790MIMIC-IV\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u63d0\u53d648\u5c0f\u65f6\u5185\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u548c\u751f\u7406\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u5904\u7406\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08\u5305\u62ecLightGBM\u7b496\u79cd\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "LightGBM\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff08AUROC 0.808\uff09\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\u4e0eAKI\u673a\u5236\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4bAKI\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9ad8\u9634\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u503c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u60a3\u8005\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u96c6\u6210\u3002"}}

However, the image matching accuracy is usually degraded by the\nnonlinear radiation and geometric deformation differences caused by different\nspectral responses. To address these problems, we proposed a phase consistency\nweighted least absolute deviation (PCWLAD) sub-pixel template matching method\nto improve the matching accuracy of multimodal optical images. This method\nconsists of two main steps: coarse matching with the structural similarity\nindex measure (SSIM) and fine matching with WLAD. In the coarse matching step,\nPCs are calculated without a noise filter to preserve the original structural\ndetails, and template matching is performed using the SSIM. In the fine\nmatching step, we applied the radiometric and geometric transformation models\nbetween two multimodal PC templates based on the coarse matching. Furthermore,\nmutual structure filtering is adopted in the model to mitigate the impact of\nnoise within the corresponding templates on the structural consistency, and the\nWLAD criterion is used to estimate the sub-pixel offset. To evaluate the\nperformance of PCWLAD, we created three types of image datasets: visible to\ninfrared Landsat images, visible to near-infrared close-range images, and\nvisible to infrared uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) images.

However, recent studies reveal that transformers are susceptible to\nbackdoor attacks. Prior backdoor attack methods typically rely on retraining\nwith clean data or altering the model architecture, both of which can be\nresource-intensive and intrusive. In this paper, we propose Head-wise Pruning\nand Malicious Injection (HPMI), a novel retraining-free backdoor attack on\ntransformers that does not alter the model's architecture. Our approach\nrequires only a small subset of the original data and basic knowledge of the\nmodel architecture, eliminating the need for retraining the target transformer.\nTechnically, HPMI works by pruning the least important head and injecting a\npre-trained malicious head to establish the backdoor. We provide a rigorous\ntheoretical justification demonstrating that the implanted backdoor resists\ndetection and removal by state-of-the-art defense techniques, under reasonable\nassumptions. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets further validate\nthe effectiveness of HPMI, showing that it 1) incurs negligible clean accuracy\nloss, 2) achieves at least 99.55% attack success rate, and 3) bypasses four\nadvanced defense mechanisms.

It proposes an adaptive resource\norchestration method based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. The method\nintroduces a heterogeneous role-based agent modeling mechanism. This allows\ndifferent resource entities, such as compute nodes, storage nodes, and\nschedulers, to adopt distinct policy representations. These agents are better\nable to reflect diverse functional responsibilities and local environmental\ncharacteristics within the system. A reward-shaping mechanism is designed to\nintegrate local observations with global feedback. This helps mitigate policy\nlearning bias caused by incomplete state observations. By combining real-time\nlocal performance signals with global system value estimation, the mechanism\nimproves coordination among agents and enhances policy convergence stability. A\nunified multi-agent training framework is developed and evaluated on a\nrepresentative production scheduling dataset. Experimental results show that\nthe proposed method outperforms traditional approaches across multiple key\nmetrics. These include resource utilization, scheduling latency, policy\nconvergence speed, system stability, and fairness. The results demonstrate\nstrong generalization and practical utility.

Recently, computational\npathology combined with deep learning methods has shown tremendous potential in\nadvancing automatic morphological analysis of glomerular ultrastructure.\nHowever, current research predominantly focuses on the recognition of\nindividual ultrastructure, which makes it challenging to meet practical\ndiagnostic needs.

We developed a\nconformal prediction framework anticipating medication needs up to two years in\nadvance with reliable prediction intervals and statistical guarantees. Our\napproach addresses zero-inflation in PD inpatient data, where patients maintain\nstable medication regimens between visits. Using electronic health records from\n631 inpatient admissions at University of Florida Health (2011-2021), our\ntwo-stage approach identifies patients likely to need medication changes, then\npredicts required levodopa equivalent daily dose adjustments. Our framework\nachieved marginal coverage while reducing prediction interval lengths compared\nto traditional approaches, providing precise predictions for short-term\nplanning and wider ranges for long-term forecasting. By quantifying\nuncertainty, our approach enables evidence-based decisions about levodopa\ndosing, optimizing symptom control while minimizing side effects and improving\nlife quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u672a\u6765\u4e24\u5e74\u7684\u836f\u7269\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u836f\u7269\u7ba1\u7406\u56e0\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u800c\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bd5\u9519\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u4e14\u672a\u8003\u8651\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e34\u5e8a\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u8bc6\u522b\u9700\u8981\u836f\u7269\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u9884\u6d4b\u5de6\u65cb\u591a\u5df4\u7b49\u6548\u65e5\u5242\u91cf\u8c03\u6574\u3002\u5229\u7528\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96f6\u81a8\u80c0\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8fb9\u9645\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u77ed\u671f\u7cbe\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u957f\u671f\u8f83\u5bbd\u8303\u56f4\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u5de6\u65cb\u591a\u5df4\u5242\u91cf\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u75c7\u72b6\u63a7\u5236\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u526f\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u6d3b\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

This visual-to-neural\nmapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs\nreliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and\nsubjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously\nmodel this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional\nconsistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we\npropose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from\nvisual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically\ninterpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE\nmodels neural representations as continuous probability distributions via\nprobabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual\nsemantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic\ntransmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response\nmanifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in\nsubject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance.

However, existing CRS faces challenges in capturing the deep\nsemantics of user preferences and dialogue context. In particular, the\nefficient integration of external knowledge graph (KG) information into\ndialogue generation and recommendation remains a pressing issue. Traditional\napproaches typically combine KG information directly with dialogue content,\nwhich often struggles with complex semantic relationships, resulting in\nrecommendations that may not align with user expectations.\n  To address these challenges, we introduce STEP, a conversational recommender\ncentered on pre-trained language models that combines curriculum-guided\ncontext-knowledge fusion with lightweight task-specific prompt tuning. At its\nheart, an F-Former progressively aligns the dialogue context with\nknowledge-graph entities through a three-stage curriculum, thus resolving\nfine-grained semantic mismatches.

However, these\nmodels still face challenges in suppressing content that is strongly entangled\nwith specific words. For example, when generating an image of ``Charlie\nChaplin\", a ``mustache\" consistently appears even if explicitly instructed not\nto include it, as the concept of ``mustache\" is strongly entangled with\n``Charlie Chaplin\". To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to\ndirectly suppress such entangled content within the text embedding space of\ndiffusion models. Our method introduces a delta vector that modifies the text\nembedding to weaken the influence of undesired content in the generated image,\nand we further demonstrate that this delta vector can be easily obtained\nthrough a zero-shot approach. Furthermore, we propose a Selective Suppression\nwith Delta Vector (SSDV) method to adapt delta vector into the cross-attention\nmechanism, enabling more effective suppression of unwanted content in regions\nwhere it would otherwise be generated. Additionally, we enabled more precise\nsuppression in personalized T2I models by optimizing delta vector, which\nprevious baselines were unable to achieve.

Experiments on the PrefEval benchmark, including implicit\npreference-following tasks, show that PREF achieves higher accuracy, better\ncalibration, and closer alignment with human judgments than strong baselines.\nBy enabling scalable, interpretable, and user-aligned evaluation, PREF lays the\ngroundwork for more reliable assessment and development of personalised\nlanguage generation systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "PREF\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u6b65\u6d41\u7a0b\uff08\u8986\u76d6\u3001\u504f\u597d\u3001\u8bc4\u5206\uff09\u8054\u5408\u8861\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u7528\u6237\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u9700\u6c42\uff0cPREF\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "PREF\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u6b65\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a1) \u8986\u76d6\u9636\u6bb5\u751f\u6210\u901a\u7528\u51c6\u5219\uff1b2) \u504f\u597d\u9636\u6bb5\u7ed3\u5408\u7528\u6237\u753b\u50cf\u8c03\u6574\u51c6\u5219\uff1b3) \u8bc4\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u7528LLM\u6309\u51c6\u5219\u6253\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5728PrefEval\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPREF\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u548c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PREF\u4e3a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Unlike\nprevious approaches that rely on fixed slope anchors, SC-Lane adaptively\ndetermines the fusion of slope-specific height features, improving robustness\nto diverse road geometries. To achieve this, we propose a Slope-Aware Adaptive\nFeature module that dynamically predicts the appropriate weights from image\ncues for integrating multi-slope representations into a unified heightmap.\nAdditionally, a Height Consistency Module enforces temporal coherence, ensuring\nstable and accurate height estimation across consecutive frames, which is\ncrucial for real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of\nSC-Lane, we employ three standardized metrics-Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Root\nMean Squared Error (RMSE), and threshold-based accuracy-which, although common\nin surface and depth estimation, have been underutilized for road height\nassessment. Using the LiDAR-derived heightmap dataset introduced in prior work\n[20], we benchmark our method under these metrics, thereby establishing a\nrigorous standard for future comparisons. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane\nbenchmark demonstrate that SC-Lane significantly improves both height\nestimation and 3D lane detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with\nan F-score of 64.3%, outperforming existing methods by a notable margin.

Mamba, a recent\nsequence-to-sequence SSM, offers competitive accuracy with superior\ncomputational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art transformer models.

Then, it performs an\napproximation-aware neural architecture search (NAS) to tune the learnable\nparameters used during approximation.

As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade\nincreased computation for reduced memory operations. To that end, we present\nXQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude\nreduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial\naccuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods.\nWe accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X,\ninstead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and\nValues on-the-fly during inference.

The\nteacher model generates pseudo-labels for the unlabeled modality,\nsimultaneously supporting the training of the student model. The collaborative\ndesign enables cross-modality knowledge transfer from the labeled modality to\nthe unlabeled modality, and facilitates effective SM-to-DMD branch supervision.\nTo further improve the decoupling ability of the model and the pseudo-label\nquality, we introduce a Progressive and Self-Tuning Training Strategy (PaST)\nthat trains the model in three stages: (1) pretraining SM-Branch, (2) guiding\nthe learning of DMD-Branch by SM-Branch, and (3) refining DMD-Branch.

Most of the\nexisting online VSR methods solely employ one neighboring previous frame to\nachieve temporal alignment, which limits long-range temporal modeling of\nvideos. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have been proposed with linear\ncomputational complexity and a global receptive field, which significantly\nimprove computational efficiency and performance. In this context, this paper\npresents a novel online VSR method based on Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs\n(TS-Mamba), leveraging both long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity\nMamba to achieve efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation.\nSpecifically, TS-Mamba first constructs the trajectories within a video to\nselect the most similar tokens from the previous frames. Then, a\nTrajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module consisting of proposed\nshifted SSMs blocks is employed to aggregate the selected tokens. The shifted\nSSMs blocks are designed based on Hilbert scannings and corresponding shift\noperations to compensate for scanning losses and strengthen the spatial\ncontinuity of Mamba. Additionally, we propose a trajectory-aware loss function\nto supervise the trajectory generation, ensuring the accuracy of token\nselection when training our model.

Inherited from generic federated learning, FGL is\ncritically challenged by statistical heterogeneity, where non-IID data\ndistributions across clients can severely impair model performance. A\nparticularly destructive form of this is class imbalance, which causes the\nglobal model to become biased towards majority classes and fail at identifying\nrare but critical events. This issue is exacerbated in FGL, as nodes from a\nminority class are often surrounded by biased neighborhood information,\nhindering the learning of expressive embeddings. To grapple with this\nchallenge, we propose GraphFedMIG, a novel FGL framework that reframes the\nproblem as a federated generative data augmentation task. GraphFedMIG employs a\nhierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local\ngenerator to synthesize high-fidelity feature representations.

We focus on a specific implementation of these LLM errors,\n{confabulations, defined as responses that are arbitrary and semantically\nmisaligned with the user's query. Existing methods like Semantic Entropy test\nfor arbitrariness by measuring the diversity of answers to a single, fixed\nprompt. Our SDM framework improves upon this by being more prompt-aware: we\ntest for a deeper form of arbitrariness by measuring response consistency not\nonly across multiple answers but also across multiple, semantically-equivalent\nparaphrases of the original prompt. Methodologically, our approach uses joint\nclustering on sentence embeddings to create a shared topic space for prompts\nand answers. A heatmap of topic co-occurances between prompts and responses can\nbe viewed as a quantified two-dimensional visualization of the user-machine\ndialogue. We then compute a suite of information-theoretic metrics to measure\nthe semantic divergence between prompts and responses. Our practical score,\n$\\mathcal{S}_H$, combines the Jensen-Shannon divergence and Wasserstein\ndistance to quantify this divergence, with a high score indicating a\nFaithfulness hallucination. Furthermore, we identify the KL divergence\nKL(Answer $||$ Prompt) as a powerful indicator of \\textbf{Semantic\nExploration}, a key signal for distinguishing different generative behaviors.\nThese metrics are further combined into the Semantic Box, a diagnostic\nframework for classifying LLM response types, including the dangerous,\nconfident confabulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6SDM\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4bLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6587\u672c\u662f\u5426\u504f\u79bb\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u8054\u5408\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u91cf\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u90a3\u4e9b\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e25\u91cd\u504f\u79bb\u7684\u2018\u81ea\u4fe1\u865a\u6784\u2019\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8054\u5408\u805a\u7c7b\u521b\u5efa\u5171\u4eab\u4e3b\u9898\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982Jensen-Shannon\u6563\u5ea6\u548cWasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86$\\mathcal{S}_H$\u8bc4\u5206\u548cKL\u6563\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u2018\u8bed\u4e49\u76d2\u2019\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "SDM\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4bLLM\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

When\nemploying family of conventional algorithms based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC) such as simulated annealing or parallel tempering, one assumes\nhomogeneous (equilibrium) temperature profiles across input. This instance\nindependent approach was shown to be ineffective for the hardest benchmarks\nnear a computational phase transition when the so-called overlap-gap-property\nholds. In these regimes conventional MCMC struggles to unfreeze rigid\nvariables, escape suboptimal basins of attraction, and sample high-quality and\ndiverse solutions. In order to mitigate these challenges, Nonequilibrium\nNonlocal Monte Carlo (NMC) algorithms were proposed that leverage inhomogeneous\ntemperature profiles thereby accelerating exploration of the configuration\nspace without compromising its exploitation. Here, we employ deep reinforcement\nlearning (RL) to train the nonlocal transition policies of NMC which were\npreviously designed phenomenologically.

As they\nevolve into more sophisticated versions, it is essential to assess whether they\nreproduce biases, such as discrimination and racialization, while maintaining\nhegemonic discourses. Current bias detection approaches rely mostly on\nquantitative, automated methods, which often overlook the nuanced ways in which\nbiases emerge in natural language. This study proposes a qualitative,\ndiscursive framework to complement such methods. Through manual analysis of\nLLM-generated short stories featuring Black and white women, we investigate\ngender and racial biases. We contend that qualitative methods such as the one\nproposed here are fundamental to help both developers and users identify the\nprecise ways in which biases manifest in LLM outputs, thus enabling better\nconditions to mitigate them. Results show that Black women are portrayed as\ntied to ancestry and resistance, while white women appear in self-discovery\nprocesses. These patterns reflect how language models replicate crystalized\ndiscursive representations, reinforcing essentialization and a sense of social\nimmobility. When prompted to correct biases, models offered superficial\nrevisions that maintained problematic meanings, revealing limitations in\nfostering inclusive narratives. Our results demonstrate the ideological\nfunctioning of algorithms and have significant implications for the ethical use\nand development of AI.

In practice, each hospital may need\nto train distinct models - differing in learning task, width, and depth - to\nmatch local data. For example, one hospital may use Euclidean architectures\nsuch as MLPs and CNNs for tabular or grid-like image data, while another may\nrequire non-Euclidean architectures such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for\nirregular data like brain connectomes. How to train such heterogeneous models\ncoherently across datasets, while enhancing each model's generalizability,\nremains an open problem. We propose unified learning, a new paradigm that\nencodes each model into a graph representation, enabling unification in a\nshared graph learning space.

By decoupling parameters of individual models and controlling them\nthrough a unified GNN (uGNN), our method supports parameter sharing and\nknowledge transfer across varying architectures (MLPs, CNNs, GNNs) and\ndistributions, improving generalizability. Evaluations on MorphoMNIST and two\nMedMNIST benchmarks - PneumoniaMNIST and BreastMNIST - show that unified\nlearning boosts performance when models are trained on unique distributions and\ntested on mixed ones, demonstrating strong robustness to unseen data with large\ndistribution shifts.

However, current methods frequently produce videos\nwith motion blur and lip jitter, primarily due to their reliance on implicit\nmodeling of audio-facial motion correlations--an approach lacking explicit\narticulatory priors (i.e., anatomical guidance for speech-related facial\nmovements). To overcome this limitation, we propose HM-Talker, a novel\nframework for generating high-fidelity, temporally coherent talking heads.\nHM-Talker leverages a hybrid motion representation combining both implicit and\nexplicit motion cues. Explicit cues use Action Units (AUs), anatomically\ndefined facial muscle movements, alongside implicit features to minimize\nphoneme-viseme misalignment. Specifically, our Cross-Modal Disentanglement\nModule (CMDM) extracts complementary implicit/explicit motion features while\npredicting AUs directly from audio input aligned to visual cues. To mitigate\nidentity-dependent biases in explicit features and enhance cross-subject\ngeneralization, we introduce the Hybrid Motion Modeling Module (HMMM). This\nmodule dynamically merges randomly paired implicit/explicit features, enforcing\nidentity-agnostic learning.

To address this\nlimitation, we propose Multi-Modal Agent, a novel agentic system designed to\nsolve this task in a more flexible and adaptive manner. Specifically, our\nmethod leverages the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to\ngenerate dynamic workflows tailored to each input. This adaptive procedure\niteratively interacts with a set of specialized tools designed for low-level\ntasks across different modalities to identify the target object described by\nthe multimodal cues.

Given the LLM's diminished reasoning\nover extended context and high computational cost, retrieval-based approaches\nremain a pivotal role in practice. However, traditional RAG methods can fall\nshort due to their stateless, single-step retrieval process, which often\noverlooks the dynamic nature of capturing interconnected relations within\nlong-range context. In this work, we propose ComoRAG, holding the principle\nthat narrative reasoning is not a one-shot process, but a dynamic, evolving\ninterplay between new evidence acquisition and past knowledge consolidation,\nanalogous to human cognition when reasoning with memory-related signals in the\nbrain. Specifically, when encountering a reasoning impasse, ComoRAG undergoes\niterative reasoning cycles while interacting with a dynamic memory workspace.\nIn each cycle, it generates probing queries to devise new exploratory paths,\nthen integrates the retrieved evidence of new aspects into a global memory\npool, thereby supporting the emergence of a coherent context for the query\nresolution. Across four challenging long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+\ntokens), ComoRAG outperforms strong RAG baselines with consistent relative\ngains up to 11% compared to the strongest baseline. Further analysis reveals\nthat ComoRAG is particularly advantageous for complex queries requiring global\ncomprehension, offering a principled, cognitively motivated paradigm for\nretrieval-based long context comprehension towards stateful reasoning.

We annotate 900 translation pairs from nine modern\nsystems, including GPT-4o and Google Translate, across four domains: web, news,\nWikipedia, and social media. We find these systems fail at idiom translation,\nproducing incorrect, literal, partial, or even missing translations. The\nbest-performing system, GPT-4, makes errors in 28% of cases. We also find that\nexisting evaluation metrics measure idiom quality poorly with Pearson\ncorrelation below 0.48 with human ratings. We thus develop improved models that\nachieve F$_1$ scores of 0.68 for detecting idiom translation errors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faIdiomEval\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u6587\u6210\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982GPT-4\uff09\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe28%\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e2d\u6587\u6210\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5728\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaIdiomEval\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6807\u6ce8900\u5bf9\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e5d\u5927\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982GPT-4\uff09\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u9ad8\uff08\u5982GPT-4\u9519\u8bef\u738728%\uff09\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u5206\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f4e\uff08<0.48\uff09\u3002\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578bF1\u5206\u6570\u8fbe0.68\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e2d\u6587\u6210\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4ecd\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\uff0cIdiomEval\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

The final Version of Record will appear in the MICCAI 2025\n  proceedings (Springer LNCS)", "summary": "Metal artifacts, caused by high-density metallic implants in computed\ntomography (CT) imaging, severely degrade image quality, complicating diagnosis\nand treatment planning. While existing deep learning algorithms have achieved\nnotable success in Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR), they often struggle to\nsuppress artifacts while preserving structural details. To address this\nchallenge, we propose FIND-Net (Fourier-Integrated Network with Dictionary\nKernels), a novel MAR framework that integrates frequency and spatial domain\nprocessing to achieve superior artifact suppression and structural\npreservation. FIND-Net incorporates Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) layers and\ntrainable Gaussian filtering, treating MAR as a hybrid task operating in both\nspatial and frequency domains. This approach enhances global contextual\nunderstanding and frequency selectivity, effectively reducing artifacts while\nmaintaining anatomical structures. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that\nFIND-Net achieves statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art\nMAR methods, with a 3.07% MAE reduction, 0.18% SSIM increase, and 0.90% PSNR\nimprovement, confirming robustness across varying artifact complexities.\nFurthermore, evaluations on real-world clinical CT scans confirm FIND-Net's\nability to minimize modifications to clean anatomical regions while effectively\nsuppressing metal-induced distortions. These findings highlight FIND-Net's\npotential for advancing MAR performance, offering superior structural\npreservation and improved clinical applicability.

However, these models\nsuffer from a core problem known as text dominance: they depend heavily on text\nfor their inference, while underutilizing other modalities. While prior work\nhas acknowledged this phenomenon in vision-language tasks, often attributing it\nto data biases or model architectures. In this paper, we conduct the first\nsystematic investigation of text dominance across diverse data modalities,\nincluding images, videos, audio, time-series, and graphs. To measure this\nimbalance, we propose two evaluation metrics: the Modality Dominance Index\n(MDI) and the Attention Efficiency Index (AEI). Our comprehensive analysis\nreveals that text dominance is both significant and pervasive across all tested\nmodalities. Our in-depth analysis identifies three underlying causes: attention\ndilution from severe token redundancy in non-textual modalities, the influence\nof fusion architecture design, and task formulations that implicitly favor\ntextual inputs. Furthermore, we propose a simple token compression method that\neffectively rebalances model attention. Applying this method to LLaVA-7B, for\ninstance, drastically reduces its MDI from 10.23 to a well-balanced value of\n0.86.

Yet, recent progress in generation\nquality has come at the expense of generation diversity, limiting the utility\nof these models as a source of synthetic training data. Although guidance-based\napproaches have been introduced to improve the utility of generated data by\nfocusing on quality or diversity, the (implicit or explicit) utility functions\noftentimes disregard the potential distribution shift between synthetic and\nreal data. In this work, we introduce Chamfer Guidance: a training-free\nguidance approach which leverages a handful of real exemplar images to\ncharacterize the quality and diversity of synthetic data. We show that by\nleveraging the proposed Chamfer Guidance, we can boost the diversity of the\ngenerations w.r.t. a dataset of real images while maintaining or improving the\ngeneration quality on ImageNet-1k and standard geo-diversity benchmarks.

Existing defenses, including host\nbased patching and network based filtering, are inadequate due to limited\nscalability across diverse devices, compatibility issues especially with\nembedded or legacy systems, and error prone deployment process (manual patch\nvalidation). To address these issues, we introduce REFN (Reinforcement Learning\nFrom Network), a novel framework that trains Large Language Models (LLMs) to\nautonomously generate network filters to prevent 1 day or n day exploitations.\nREFN ensures scalability by uniquely employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) driven\nby online network rewards instead of traditional Human Feedback (RLHF). REFN\nguarantees compatibility via unified deployment on edge security gateways\n(Amazon Eero). REFN provides robustness via online validation using real\nnetwork traffic. Crucially, REFN addresses three core challenges in training\nLLMs for exploit prevention: 1) expanding current LLMs limited vulnerability\nfixing expertise via Agentic RAG based Knowledge Distillation, 2) bridging\ncurrent LLMs language to network gaps through an RL From VNF Pipeline that\ntranslates language context (vulnerability description) into network\nenforcement, 3) addressing the LLM hallucination and non determinism via the\nOnline Agentic Validation that penalizes erroneous outputs. Evaluated across 22\nfamilies of 1 day or n day exploits, REFN demonstrates effectiveness (21.1\npercent higher accuracy than alternatives), efficiency (Mean Time To Patch of\n3.65 hours) and scalability (easily scale to 10K devices).

Extensive experiments demonstrate ICE's effectiveness,\nachieving up to 17.29% accuracy improvement with 4.12$\\times$ speedup on GSM8K,\nand up to 276.67$\\times$ acceleration on MMLU while maintaining competitive\nperformance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aICE\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u4f20\u7edf\u524d\u7f00\u63d0\u793a\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08dLLMs\uff09\u7684\u539f\u5730\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u524d\u7f00\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u987a\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u5f0f\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53cc\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08dLLMs\uff09\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "method": "ICE\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u539f\u5730\u63d0\u793a\u76f4\u63a5\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u6807\u8bb0\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63d0\u524d\u9000\u51fa\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cICE\u5728GSM8K\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8617.29%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u548c4.12\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5728MMLU\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86276.67\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "ICE\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u539f\u5730\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u63d0\u524d\u9000\u51fa\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86dLLMs\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u53cc\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The constructed dataset must not contain identities overlapping with any\nexisting public face datasets. To handle this challenge, we begin with a\nthorough cleaning of the baseline HSFace dataset, identifying and removing\nmislabeled or inconsistent identities through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\nstrategy combining face embedding clustering and GPT-4o-assisted verification.\nWe retain the largest consistent identity cluster and apply data augmentation\nup to a fixed number of images per identity. To further diversify the dataset,\nwe generate synthetic identities using Stable Diffusion with prompt\nengineering. As diffusion models are computationally intensive, we generate\nonly one reference image per identity and efficiently expand it using Vec2Face,\nwhich rapidly produces 49 identity-consistent variants. This hybrid approach\nfuses GAN-based and diffusion-based samples, enabling efficient construction of\na diverse and high-quality dataset. To address the high visual similarity among\nsynthetic identities, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy by placing them\nearly in the training schedule, allowing the model to progress from easier to\nharder samples.

By\ngenerating tokens in parallel through an iterative denoising process, DLMs\npossess inherent advantages in reducing inference latency and capturing\nbidirectional context, thereby enabling fine-grained control over the\ngeneration process. While achieving a several-fold speed-up, recent\nadvancements have allowed DLMs to show performance comparable to their\nautoregressive counterparts, making them a compelling choice for various\nnatural language processing tasks. In this survey, we provide a holistic\noverview of the current DLM landscape. We trace its evolution and relationship\nwith other paradigms, such as autoregressive and masked language models, and\ncover both foundational principles and state-of-the-art models. Our work offers\nan up-to-date, comprehensive taxonomy and an in-depth analysis of current\ntechniques, from pre-training strategies to advanced post-training methods.\nAnother contribution of this survey is a thorough review of DLM inference\nstrategies and optimizations, including improvements in decoding parallelism,\ncaching mechanisms, and generation quality. We also highlight the latest\napproaches to multimodal extensions of DLMs and delineate their applications\nacross various practical scenarios. Furthermore, our discussion addresses the\nlimitations and challenges of DLMs, including efficiency, long-sequence\nhandling, and infrastructure requirements, while outlining future research\ndirections to sustain progress in this rapidly evolving field.

Specifically, an event\ncorrection module (ECM) temporally aligns asynchronous event streams with image\nframes via optical-flow-based warping, jointly optimized with the detection\nnetwork to learn task-aware event representations. The event dynamic upsampling\nmodule (EDUM) enhances spatial resolution of event frames to match image\nstructures, ensuring precise spatiotemporal alignment. The cross-modal mamba\nfusion module (CMM) uses adaptive feature fusion with a novel interlaced\nscanning mechanism, effectively integrating complementary information for\nrobust detection. Experiments conducted on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD\ndatasets demonstrate that MCFNet significantly outperforms existing methods in\nvarious poor lighting and fast moving traffic scenarios.

This causes a critical trust issue: if only a few computationally\nrich parties can obtain data attributions, how can resource-constrained parties\ntrust that the provided attributions are indeed \"good,\" especially when they\nare used for important downstream applications (e.g., data pricing)? In this\npaper, we address this trust issue by proposing an interactive verification\nparadigm for data attribution. An untrusted and computationally powerful Prover\nlearns data attributions, and then engages in an interactive proof with a\nresource-constrained Verifier. Our main result is a protocol that provides\nformal completeness, soundness, and efficiency guarantees in the sense of\nProbably-Approximately-Correct (PAC) verification. Specifically, if both Prover\nand Verifier follow the protocol, the Verifier accepts data attributions that\nare {\\epsilon}-close to the optimal data attributions (in terms of the Mean\nSquared Error) with probability 1-{\\delta}. Conversely, if the Prover\narbitrarily deviates from the protocol, even with infinite compute, then this\nis detected (or it still yields data attributions to the Verifier) except with\nprobability {\\delta}. Importantly, our protocol ensures the Verifier's\nworkload, measured by the number of independent model retrainings it must\nperform, scales only as O(1/{\\epsilon}); i.e., independently of the dataset\nsize.

Several approaches have been proposed that rely\non either external counting modules for iterative refinement or quantity\nrepresentations derived from learned tokens or latent features. However, they\nstill have limitations in accurately reflecting the specified number of objects\nand overlook an important structural characteristic--The number of object\ninstances in the generated image is largely determined in the early timesteps\nof the denoising process. To correctly reflect the object quantity for image\ngeneration, the highly activated regions in the object cross-attention map at\nthe early timesteps should match the input object quantity, while each region\nshould be clearly separated.

While autoregressive generative\nmodels are trained only on index values, the prior encoded in the codebook,\nwhich contains rich token similarity information, is not exploited. Recent\nstudies have attempted to incorporate this prior by performing naive k-means\nclustering on the tokens, helping to facilitate the training of generative\nmodels with a reduced codebook. However, we reveal that k-means clustering\nperforms poorly in the codebook feature space due to inherent issues, including\ntoken space disparity and centroid distance inaccuracy. In this work, we\npropose the Discriminative Codebook Prior Extractor (DCPE) as an alternative to\nk-means clustering for more effectively mining and utilizing the token\nsimilarity information embedded in the codebook. DCPE replaces the commonly\nused centroid-based distance, which is found to be unsuitable and inaccurate\nfor the token feature space, with a more reasonable instance-based distance.\nUsing an agglomerative merging technique, it further addresses the token space\ndisparity issue by avoiding splitting high-density regions and aggregating\nlow-density ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCPE is plug-and-play\nand integrates seamlessly with existing codebook prior-based paradigms.

However, existing benchmarks and studies are mainly limited to\ncommon daily activities such as cooking and cleaning. In contrast, real-world\ndeployment inevitably encounters domain shifts, where target domains differ\nsubstantially in both visual style and semantic content. To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce \\textbf{EgoCross}, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the\ncross-domain generalization of MLLMs in EgocentricQA. EgoCross covers four\ndiverse and challenging domains, including surgery, industry, extreme sports,\nand animal perspective, representing realistic and high-impact application\nscenarios. It comprises approximately 1,000 QA pairs across 798 video clips,\nspanning four key QA tasks: prediction, recognition, localization, and\ncounting. Each QA pair provides both OpenQA and CloseQA formats to support\nfine-grained evaluation. Extensive experiments show that most existing MLLMs,\nwhether general-purpose or egocentric-specialized, struggle to generalize to\ndomains beyond daily life, highlighting the limitations of current models.\nFurthermore, we conduct several pilot studies, \\eg, fine-tuning and\nreinforcement learning, to explore potential improvements.

Recent heatmap-based approaches can localize potential regions of\nsymmetry axes but often lack precision in identifying individual axes. In this\nwork, we propose a novel framework for axis-level detection of the two most\ncommon symmetry types-reflection and rotation-by representing them as explicit\ngeometric primitives, i.e. lines and points. Our method employs a dual-branch\narchitecture that is equivariant to the dihedral group, with each branch\nspecialized to exploit the structure of dihedral group-equivariant features for\nits respective symmetry type.

Current deepfake detection methods\nperform well on specific datasets, but exhibit poor performance when applied to\ndatasets with unknown forgery techniques. Moreover, as the gap between emerging\nand traditional forgery techniques continues to widen, cross-domain detection\nmethods that rely on common forgery traces are becoming increasingly\nineffective. This situation highlights the urgency of developing deepfake\ndetection technology with strong generalization to cope with fast iterative\nforgery techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a Forgery Guided\nLearning (FGL) strategy designed to enable detection networks to continuously\nadapt to unknown forgery techniques. Specifically, the FGL strategy captures\nthe differential information between known and unknown forgery techniques,\nallowing the model to dynamically adjust its learning process in real time. To\nfurther improve the ability to perceive forgery traces, we design a Dual\nPerception Network (DPNet) that captures both differences and relationships\namong forgery traces. In the frequency stream, the network dynamically\nperceives and extracts discriminative features across various forgery\ntechniques, establishing essential detection cues. These features are then\nintegrated with spatial features and projected into the embedding space. In\naddition, graph convolution is employed to perceive relationships across the\nentire feature space, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of\nforgery trace correlations.

While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have\nshown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining\nthese approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration\nyields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after\nstep distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To\novercome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint\ntraining framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention\n(ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to\nfocus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware\nstep distillation paradigm built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM)\nthat directly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than\ntreating it as a separate compression step, with fast convergence. We validate\nBLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B. Our framework\ndemonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales.

Specifically, we are\nthe first to extract the prior shapes of objects based on the layout for\ndiffusion models in remote sensing.

In this work, we propose PhysHPO, a novel\nframework for Hierarchical Cross-Modal Direct Preference Optimization, to\ntackle this challenge by enabling fine-grained preference alignment for\nphysically plausible video generation. PhysHPO optimizes video alignment across\nfour hierarchical granularities: a) Instance Level, aligning the overall video\ncontent with the input prompt; b) State Level, ensuring temporal consistency\nusing boundary frames as anchors; c) Motion Level, modeling motion trajectories\nfor realistic dynamics; and d) Semantic Level, maintaining logical consistency\nbetween narrative and visuals. Recognizing that real-world videos are the best\nreflections of physical phenomena, we further introduce an automated data\nselection pipeline to efficiently identify and utilize \"good data\" from\nexisting large-scale text-video datasets, thereby eliminating the need for\ncostly and time-intensive dataset construction. Extensive experiments on both\nphysics-focused and general capability benchmarks demonstrate that PhysHPO\nsignificantly improves physical plausibility and overall video generation\nquality of advanced models.

Despite recent\nadvances in AI, existing methods often handle these stages separately, leading\nto error accumulation and artifacts. For instance, inbetweening approaches\nstruggle with large motions, while colorization methods require dense per-frame\nsketches. To address this, we introduce ToonComposer, a generative model that\nunifies inbetweening and colorization into a single post-keyframing stage.\nToonComposer employs a sparse sketch injection mechanism to provide precise\ncontrol using keyframe sketches. Additionally, it uses a cartoon adaptation\nmethod with the spatial low-rank adapter to tailor a modern video foundation\nmodel to the cartoon domain while keeping its temporal prior intact.

While QINRs recently\nemerged as a promising new paradigm, many challenges concerning their\narchitecture and ansatz design, the utility of quantum-mechanical properties,\ntraining efficiency and the interplay with classical modules remain. This paper\nadvances the field by introducing a new type of QINR for 2D image and 3D\ngeometric field learning, which we collectively refer to as Quantum Visual\nField (QVF). QVF encodes classical data into quantum statevectors using neural\namplitude encoding grounded in a learnable energy manifold, ensuring meaningful\nHilbert space embeddings. Our ansatz follows a fully entangled design of\nlearnable parametrised quantum circuits, with quantum (unitary) operations\nperformed in the real Hilbert space, resulting in numerically stable training\nwith fast convergence. QVF does not rely on classical post-processing -- in\ncontrast to the previous QINR learning approach -- and directly employs\nprojective measurement to extract learned signals encoded in the ansatz.\nExperiments on a quantum hardware simulator demonstrate that QVF outperforms\nthe existing quantum approach and widely used classical foundational baselines\nin terms of visual representation accuracy across various metrics and model\ncharacteristics, such as learning of high-frequency details. We also show\napplications of QVF in 2D and 3D field completion and 3D shape interpolation,\nhighlighting its practical potential.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u91cf\u5b50\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\uff08QVF\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e2D\u56fe\u50cf\u548c3D\u51e0\u4f55\u573a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5411\u91cf\u7f16\u7801\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002QVF\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5b50\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5b50\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\uff08QINRs\uff09\u5728\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u5229\u7528\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u53ca\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u5757\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u91cf\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u632f\u5e45\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5168\u7ea0\u7f20\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5b50\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u901a\u8fc7\u6295\u5f71\u6d4b\u91cf\u63d0\u53d6\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "QVF\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5b50\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "conclusion": "QVF\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u89c6\u89c9\u573a\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u57282D\u548c3D\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}
