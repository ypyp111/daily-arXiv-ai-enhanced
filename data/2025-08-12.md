### [1] [Med-GRIM: Enhanced Zero-Shot Medical VQA using prompt-embedded Multimodal Graph RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06496)
*Rakesh Raj Madavan,Akshat Kaimal,Hashim Faisal,Chandrakala S*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BIND和Med-GRIM通过密集编码和图检索提升医疗VQA任务的精度与效率，避免了高计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA模型在复杂领域（如医疗）中缺乏细节精度，需改进。

Method: BIND通过密集编码优化嵌入空间；Med-GRIM结合图检索和提示工程，使用小语言模型降低计算成本。

Result: Med-GRIM以低成本实现高性能，并发布DermaGraph数据集支持零样本研究。

Conclusion: BIND和Med-GRIM为医疗VQA提供了高效、精准的解决方案，并推动相关研究。

Abstract: An ensemble of trained multimodal encoders and vision-language models (VLMs)
has become a standard approach for visual question answering (VQA) tasks.
However, such models often fail to produce responses with the detailed
precision necessary for complex, domain-specific applications such as medical
VQA. Our representation model, BIND: BLIVA Integrated with Dense Encoding,
extends prior multimodal work by refining the joint embedding space through
dense, query-token-based encodings inspired by contrastive pretraining
techniques. This refined encoder powers Med-GRIM, a model designed for medical
VQA tasks that leverages graph-based retrieval and prompt engineering to
integrate domain-specific knowledge. Rather than relying on compute-heavy
fine-tuning of vision and language models on specific datasets, Med-GRIM
applies a low-compute, modular workflow with small language models (SLMs) for
efficiency. Med-GRIM employs prompt-based retrieval to dynamically inject
relevant knowledge, ensuring both accuracy and robustness in its responses. By
assigning distinct roles to each agent within the VQA system, Med-GRIM achieves
large language model performance at a fraction of the computational cost.
Additionally, to support scalable research in zero-shot multimodal medical
applications, we introduce DermaGraph, a novel Graph-RAG dataset comprising
diverse dermatological conditions. This dataset facilitates both multimodal and
unimodal querying. The code and dataset are available at:

### [2] [DiTalker: A Unified DiT-based Framework for High-Quality and Speaking Styles Controllable Portrait Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06511)
*He Feng,Yongjia Ma,Donglin Di,Lei Fan,Tonghua Su,Xiangqian Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiTalker提出了一种基于DiT的统一框架，用于控制说话风格的肖像动画，解决了现有方法忽略动态风格和计算开销大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的肖像动画方法主要关注唇同步或静态情感转换，忽略了动态风格（如头部运动），且依赖双U-Net架构导致计算开销大。

Method: 设计了Style-Emotion Encoding Module（风格-情感编码模块）和Audio-Style Fusion Module（音频-风格融合模块），并引入优化约束以提升唇同步和细节保留。

Result: 实验表明DiTalker在唇同步和说话风格可控性方面表现优越。

Conclusion: DiTalker通过统一框架和模块化设计，实现了高效的动态风格控制和高质量的肖像动画生成。

Abstract: Portrait animation aims to synthesize talking videos from a static reference
face, conditioned on audio and style frame cues (e.g., emotion and head poses),
while ensuring precise lip synchronization and faithful reproduction of
speaking styles. Existing diffusion-based portrait animation methods primarily
focus on lip synchronization or static emotion transformation, often
overlooking dynamic styles such as head movements. Moreover, most of these
methods rely on a dual U-Net architecture, which preserves identity consistency
but incurs additional computational overhead. To this end, we propose DiTalker,
a unified DiT-based framework for speaking style-controllable portrait
animation. We design a Style-Emotion Encoding Module that employs two separate
branches: a style branch extracting identity-specific style information (e.g.,
head poses and movements), and an emotion branch extracting identity-agnostic
emotion features. We further introduce an Audio-Style Fusion Module that
decouples audio and speaking styles via two parallel cross-attention layers,
using these features to guide the animation process. To enhance the quality of
results, we adopt and modify two optimization constraints: one to improve lip
synchronization and the other to preserve fine-grained identity and background
details. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DiTalker in terms
of lip synchronization and speaking style controllability. Project Page:

### [3] [BigTokDetect: A Clinically-Informed Vision-Language Model Framework for Detecting Pro-Bigorexia Videos on TikTok](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06515)
*Minh Duc Chu,Kshitij Pawar,Zihao He,Roxanna Sharifi,Ross Sonnenblick,Magdalayna Curry,Laura D'Adamo,Lindsay Young,Stuart B Murray,Kristina Lerman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出BigTokDetect框架，用于检测TikTok上促进肌肉变形行为的危害内容，通过多模态融合提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体难以检测伪装成健身内容的肌肉变形行为（pro-bigorexia），传统文本检测方法效果有限。

Method: 开发BigTokDetect框架，基于专家标注的多模态数据集BigTok（2200+视频），结合视觉语言模型进行检测。

Result: 多模态融合提升性能5-10%，主分类准确率82.9%，子分类69.0%。

Conclusion: 研究为心理健康领域的内容审核提供了新工具和方法框架。

Abstract: Social media platforms increasingly struggle to detect harmful content that
promotes muscle dysmorphic behaviors, particularly pro-bigorexia content that
disproportionately affects adolescent males. Unlike traditional eating disorder
detection focused on the "thin ideal," pro-bigorexia material masquerades as
legitimate fitness content through complex multimodal combinations of visual
displays, coded language, and motivational messaging that evade text-based
detection systems. We address this challenge by developing BigTokDetect, a
clinically-informed detection framework for identifying pro-bigorexia content
on TikTok. We introduce BigTok, the first expert-annotated multimodal dataset
of over 2,200 TikTok videos labeled by clinical psychologists and psychiatrists
across five primary categories spanning body image, nutrition, exercise,
supplements, and masculinity. Through a comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art vision language models, we achieve 0.829% accuracy on primary
category classification and 0.690% on subcategory detection via domain-specific
finetuning. Our ablation studies demonstrate that multimodal fusion improves
performance by 5-10% over text-only approaches, with video features providing
the most discriminative signals. These findings establish new benchmarks for
multimodal harmful content detection and provide both the computational tools
and methodological framework needed for scalable content moderation in
specialized mental health domains.

### [4] [Frequency Prior Guided Matching: A Data Augmentation Approach for Generalizable Semi-Supervised Polyp Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06517)
*Haoran Xi,Chen Liu,Xiaolin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FPGM是一种基于频率先验的半监督学习框架，通过利用息肉边缘的频率特征，显著提升了跨域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决息肉分割中标注数据有限和域偏移导致的性能下降问题。

Method: FPGM通过两阶段过程：学习域不变频率先验，并对未标注图像进行光谱扰动以对齐频率特征。

Result: 在六个公共数据集上表现优异，零样本泛化能力突出，Dice分数提升超过10%。

Conclusion: FPGM为临床部署提供了强大的解决方案，显著提升了有限监督下的跨域鲁棒性。

Abstract: Automated polyp segmentation is essential for early diagnosis of colorectal
cancer, yet developing robust models remains challenging due to limited
annotated data and significant performance degradation under domain shift.
Although semi-supervised learning (SSL) reduces annotation requirements,
existing methods rely on generic augmentations that ignore polyp-specific
structural properties, resulting in poor generalization to new imaging centers
and devices. To address this, we introduce Frequency Prior Guided Matching
(FPGM), a novel augmentation framework built on a key discovery: polyp edges
exhibit a remarkably consistent frequency signature across diverse datasets.
FPGM leverages this intrinsic regularity in a two-stage process. It first
learns a domain-invariant frequency prior from the edge regions of labeled
polyps. Then, it performs principled spectral perturbations on unlabeled
images, aligning their amplitude spectra with this learned prior while
preserving phase information to maintain structural integrity. This targeted
alignment normalizes domain-specific textural variations, thereby compelling
the model to learn the underlying, generalizable anatomical structure.
Validated on six public datasets, FPGM establishes a new state-of-the-art
against ten competing methods. It demonstrates exceptional zero-shot
generalization capabilities, achieving over 10% absolute gain in Dice score in
data-scarce scenarios. By significantly enhancing cross-domain robustness, FPGM
presents a powerful solution for clinically deployable polyp segmentation under
limited supervision.

### [5] [Large Language Models Facilitate Vision Reflection in Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06525)
*Guoyuan An,JaeYoon Kim,SungEui Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型多模态模型（LMMs）中视觉反射的可解释性，发现通过提示LMM验证专用视觉模型的预测可提高识别准确率，并揭示了视觉-语言连接器将视觉特征映射为文本概念的行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在提升LMMs在视觉任务中的表现和可解释性，探索视觉反射机制如何帮助模型更好地理解和推理视觉内容。

Method: 通过实验验证LMMs在验证视觉模型预测时的表现，分析视觉反射的内部行为，并测试训练无关的连接器在细粒度识别任务中的效果。

Result: 研究发现LMMs可通过视觉反射提升识别准确率，视觉-语言连接器将视觉特征转化为文本概念，且少量文本标记即可替代大量视觉标记。

Conclusion: 视觉反射是提升LMMs鲁棒性和可解释性的有效策略，为视觉-语言模型的研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: This paper presents several novel findings on the explainability of vision
reflection in large multimodal models (LMMs). First, we show that prompting an
LMM to verify the prediction of a specialized vision model can improve
recognition accuracy, even on benchmarks like ImageNet, despite prior evidence
that LMMs typically underperform dedicated vision encoders. Second, we analyze
the internal behavior of vision reflection and find that the vision-language
connector maps visual features into explicit textual concepts, allowing the
language model to reason about prediction plausibility using commonsense
knowledge. We further observe that replacing a large number of vision tokens
with only a few text tokens still enables LLaVA to generate similar answers,
suggesting that LMMs may rely primarily on a compact set of distilled textual
representations rather than raw vision features. Third, we show that a
training-free connector can enhance LMM performance in fine-grained recognition
tasks, without extensive feature-alignment training. Together, these findings
offer new insights into the explainability of vision-language models and
suggest that vision reflection is a promising strategy for achieving robust and
interpretable visual recognition.

### [6] [A Framework Combining 3D CNN and Transformer for Video-Based Behavior Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06528)
*Xiuliang Zhang,Tadiwa Elisha Nyamasvisva,Chuntao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合3D CNN和Transformer的混合框架，用于视频行为识别，解决了传统方法在长程依赖和高计算成本上的问题，并在基准数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频行为识别在公共安全、智能监控和人机交互中很重要，但传统3D CNN难以建模长程依赖，而Transformer计算成本高。

Method: 混合框架结合3D CNN提取局部时空特征和Transformer捕捉长程依赖，通过融合机制整合两者。

Result: 在基准数据集上优于传统3D CNN和单独Transformer，识别精度更高且复杂度可控。

Conclusion: 该混合框架为视频行为识别提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Video-based behavior recognition is essential in fields such as public
safety, intelligent surveillance, and human-computer interaction. Traditional
3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN) effectively capture local
spatiotemporal features but struggle with modeling long-range dependencies.
Conversely, Transformers excel at learning global contextual information but
face challenges with high computational costs. To address these limitations, we
propose a hybrid framework combining 3D CNN and Transformer architectures. The
3D CNN module extracts low-level spatiotemporal features, while the Transformer
module captures long-range temporal dependencies, with a fusion mechanism
integrating both representations. Evaluated on benchmark datasets, the proposed
model outperforms traditional 3D CNN and standalone Transformers, achieving
higher recognition accuracy with manageable complexity. Ablation studies
further validate the complementary strengths of the two modules. This hybrid
framework offers an effective and scalable solution for video-based behavior
recognition.

### [7] [RMT-PPAD: Real-time Multi-task Learning for Panoptic Perception in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06529)
*Jiayuan Wang,Q. M. Jonathan Wu,Katsuya Suto,Ning Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RMT-PPAD是一种基于Transformer的实时多任务模型，用于自动驾驶感知任务，包括目标检测、可行驶区域分割和车道线分割。通过轻量级模块和自适应解码器设计，解决了任务间负迁移问题，并在BDD100K数据集上取得了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统需要高精度和实时性的全景驾驶感知，现有方法在多任务处理中存在负迁移和手动设计任务特定结构的问题。

Method: 提出RMT-PPAD模型，采用门控适配器自适应融合共享和任务特定特征，设计自适应分割解码器自动学习多尺度特征权重，并解决车道线分割中训练与测试标签不一致问题。

Result: 在BDD100K数据集上，目标检测mAP50为84.9%，召回率95.4%；可行驶区域分割mIoU为92.6%；车道线分割IoU为56.8%，准确率84.7%；推理速度32.6 FPS。

Conclusion: RMT-PPAD在性能和实时性上均表现优异，适用于实际自动驾驶场景，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems rely on panoptic driving perception that requires
both precision and real-time performance. In this work, we propose RMT-PPAD, a
real-time, transformer-based multi-task model that jointly performs object
detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line segmentation. We introduce
a lightweight module, a gate control with an adapter to adaptively fuse shared
and task-specific features, effectively alleviating negative transfer between
tasks. Additionally, we design an adaptive segmentation decoder to learn the
weights over multi-scale features automatically during the training stage. This
avoids the manual design of task-specific structures for different segmentation
tasks. We also identify and resolve the inconsistency between training and
testing labels in lane line segmentation. This allows fairer evaluation.
Experiments on the BDD100K dataset demonstrate that RMT-PPAD achieves
state-of-the-art results with mAP50 of 84.9% and Recall of 95.4% for object
detection, mIoU of 92.6% for drivable area segmentation, and IoU of 56.8% and
accuracy of 84.7% for lane line segmentation. The inference speed reaches 32.6
FPS. Moreover, we introduce real-world scenarios to evaluate RMT-PPAD
performance in practice. The results show that RMT-PPAD consistently delivers
stable performance. The source codes and pre-trained models are released at
https://github.com/JiayuanWang-JW/RMT-PPAD.

### [8] [What Makes "Good" Distractors for Object Hallucination Evaluation in Large Vision-Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06530)
*Ming-Kun Xie,Jia-Hao Xiao,Gang Niu,Lei Feng,Zhiqiang Kou,Min-Ling Zhang,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出HOPE基准测试，通过生成误导性干扰项更严格评估大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的幻觉问题，显著优于现有POPE方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有POPE基准测试在评估LVLMs的幻觉问题时效果逐渐减弱，因其忽略了图像特定信息且仅使用负面对象类别作为干扰项。

Method: HOPE通过内容感知幻觉搜索（利用CLIP选择高预测可能性的负面对象）和描述性幻觉搜索（配对真实对象与错误描述）生成误导性干扰项。

Result: 实验显示HOPE使多种LVLMs的精度下降9%至23%，显著暴露其幻觉漏洞。

Conclusion: HOPE为评估LVLMs的幻觉问题提供了更严格的基准测试，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), empowered by the success of Large
Language Models (LLMs), have achieved impressive performance across domains.
Despite the great advances in LVLMs, they still suffer from the unavailable
object hallucination issue, which tends to generate objects inconsistent with
the image content. The most commonly used Polling-based Object Probing
Evaluation (POPE) benchmark evaluates this issue by sampling negative
categories according to category-level statistics, \textit{e.g.}, category
frequencies and co-occurrence. However, with the continuous advancement of
LVLMs, the POPE benchmark has shown diminishing effectiveness in assessing
object hallucination, as it employs a simplistic sampling strategy that
overlooks image-specific information and restricts distractors to negative
object categories only. In this paper, we introduce the Hallucination
searching-based Object Probing Evaluation (HOPE) benchmark, aiming to generate
the most misleading distractors (\textit{i.e.}, non-existent objects or
incorrect image descriptions) that can trigger hallucination in LVLMs, which
serves as a means to more rigorously assess their immunity to hallucination. To
explore the image-specific information, the content-aware hallucination
searching leverages Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) to
approximate the predictive behavior of LVLMs by selecting negative objects with
the highest predicted likelihood as distractors. To expand the scope of
hallucination assessment, the description-based hallucination searching
constructs highly misleading distractors by pairing true objects with false
descriptions. Experimental results show that HOPE leads to a precision drop of
at least 9\% and up to 23\% across various state-of-the-art LVLMs,
significantly outperforming POPE in exposing hallucination vulnerabilities. The
code is available at https://github.com/xiemk/HOPE.

### [9] [Benchmarking Deep Learning-Based Object Detection Models on Feature Deficient Astrophotography Imagery Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06537)
*Shantanusinh Parmar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文分析了现有目标检测模型在稀疏特征条件下的表现，并使用MobilTelesco数据集进行测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集（如ImageNet、COCO）缺乏非商业领域的稀疏信号特征，无法满足特殊场景需求。

Method: 使用智能手机天文摄影数据集MobilTelesco，对多种目标检测模型进行基准测试。

Result: 揭示了在特征不足条件下目标检测模型面临的挑战。

Conclusion: MobilTelesco数据集填补了稀疏信号领域的空白，为模型优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Object detection models are typically trained on datasets like ImageNet,
COCO, and PASCAL VOC, which focus on everyday objects. However, these lack
signal sparsity found in non-commercial domains. MobilTelesco, a
smartphone-based astrophotography dataset, addresses this by providing sparse
night-sky images. We benchmark several detection models on it, highlighting
challenges under feature-deficient conditions.

### [10] [MILD: Multi-Layer Diffusion Strategy for Complex and Precise Multi-IP Aware Human Erasing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06543)
*Jinghan Yu,Zhiyuan Ma,Yue Ma,Kaiqi Liu,Yuhan Wang,Jianjun Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MILD的新方法，用于解决复杂多IP场景下的人类擦除任务，通过多层扩散和空间解耦技术显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂多IP场景（如人物遮挡、物体纠缠和背景干扰）中表现不佳，主要由于数据集限制和缺乏空间解耦能力。

Method: 提出Multi-Layer Diffusion (MILD)策略，将生成过程分解为语义分离的路径，并引入Human Morphology Guidance和Spatially-Modulated Attention增强理解。

Result: MILD在挑战性的人类擦除基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MILD通过创新的解耦和注意力机制，显著提升了复杂场景下的人类擦除效果。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the success of diffusion models in
image-customized tasks. Prior works have achieved notable progress on
human-oriented erasing using explicit mask guidance and semantic-aware
inpainting. However, they struggle under complex multi-IP scenarios involving
human-human occlusions, human-object entanglements, and background
interferences. These challenges are mainly due to: 1) Dataset limitations, as
existing datasets rarely cover dense occlusions, camouflaged backgrounds, and
diverse interactions; 2) Lack of spatial decoupling, where foreground instances
cannot be effectively disentangled, limiting clean background restoration. In
this work, we introduce a high-quality multi-IP human erasing dataset with
diverse pose variations and complex backgrounds. We then propose Multi-Layer
Diffusion (MILD), a novel strategy that decomposes generation into semantically
separated pathways for each instance and the background. To enhance
human-centric understanding, we introduce Human Morphology Guidance,
integrating pose, parsing, and spatial relations. We further present
Spatially-Modulated Attention to better guide attention flow. Extensive
experiments show that MILD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on challenging
human erasing benchmarks.

*Qi Xun Yeo,Yanyan Li,Gim Hee Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种仅利用多视角RGB图像进行3D语义场景图估计的方法，克服了伪点几何噪声和背景噪声问题，通过语义掩码和邻域关系增强特征，并结合统计先验优化预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在缺乏3D真实标注的情况下，探索仅用多视角RGB图像完成3D语义场景图估计任务。

Method: 利用语义掩码引导特征聚合以减少背景噪声，设计邻域节点信息融合方法增强鲁棒性，并结合统计先验优化预测。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在仅使用多视角图像作为输入的情况下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过语义和空间信息增强以及统计先验的引入，显著提升了场景图估计的准确性。

Abstract: Modern 3D semantic scene graph estimation methods utilize ground truth 3D
annotations to accurately predict target objects, predicates, and
relationships. In the absence of given 3D ground truth representations, we
explore leveraging only multi-view RGB images to tackle this task. To attain
robust features for accurate scene graph estimation, we must overcome the noisy
reconstructed pseudo point-based geometry from predicted depth maps and reduce
the amount of background noise present in multi-view image features. The key is
to enrich node and edge features with accurate semantic and spatial information
and through neighboring relations. We obtain semantic masks to guide feature
aggregation to filter background features and design a novel method to
incorporate neighboring node information to aid robustness of our scene graph
estimates. Furthermore, we leverage on explicit statistical priors calculated
from the training summary statistics to refine node and edge predictions based
on their one-hop neighborhood. Our experiments show that our method outperforms
current methods purely using multi-view images as the initial input. Our
project page is available at https://qixun1.github.io/projects/SCRSSG.

### [12] [Slice or the Whole Pie? Utility Control for AI Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06551)
*Ye Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NNObfuscator是一种新型实用控制机制，允许AI模型根据预设条件动态调整性能，避免为不同需求训练多个模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度神经网络训练资源密集、适应多样化需求时效率低下的问题。

Method: 提出NNObfuscator机制，通过动态调整模型性能实现单一模型适应多任务需求。

Result: 实验验证了NNObfuscator在图像分类、语义分割等任务中的有效性，提高了模型适应性和资源利用率。

Conclusion: NNObfuscator为AI模型部署提供了一种高效、可持续的解决方案。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) has become an increasingly
resource-intensive task, requiring large volumes of labeled data, substantial
computational power, and considerable fine-tuning efforts to achieve optimal
performance across diverse use cases. Although pre-trained models offer a
useful starting point, adapting them to meet specific user needs often demands
extensive customization, and infrastructure overhead. This challenge grows when
a single model must support diverse appli-cations with differing requirements
for performance. Traditional solutions often involve training multiple model
versions to meet varying requirements, which can be inefficient and difficult
to maintain. In order to overcome this challenge, we propose NNObfuscator, a
novel utility control mechanism that enables AI models to dynamically modify
their performance according to predefined conditions. It is different from
traditional methods that need separate models for each user. Instead,
NNObfuscator allows a single model to be adapted in real time, giving you
controlled access to multiple levels of performance. This mechanism enables
model owners set up tiered access, ensuring that free-tier users receive a
baseline level of performance while premium users benefit from enhanced
capabilities. The approach improves resource allocation, reduces unnecessary
computation, and supports sustainable business models in AI deployment. To
validate our approach, we conducted experiments on multiple tasks, including
image classification, semantic segmentation, and text to image generation,
using well-established models such as ResNet, DeepLab, VGG16, FCN and Stable
Diffusion. Experimental results show that NNObfuscator successfully makes model
more adaptable, so that a single trained model can handle a broad range of
tasks without requiring a lot of changes.

Abstract: The challenges associated with deepfake detection are increasing
significantly with the latest advancements in technology and the growing
popularity of deepfake videos and images. Despite the presence of numerous
detection models, demographic bias in the deepfake dataset remains largely
unaddressed. This paper focuses on the mitigation of age-specific bias in the
deepfake dataset by introducing an age-diverse deepfake dataset that will
improve fairness across age groups. The dataset is constructed through a
modular pipeline incorporating the existing deepfake datasets Celeb-DF,
FaceForensics++, and UTKFace datasets, and the creation of synthetic data to
fill the age distribution gaps. The effectiveness and generalizability of this
dataset are evaluated using three deepfake detection models: XceptionNet,
EfficientNet, and LipForensics. Evaluation metrics, including AUC, pAUC, and
EER, revealed that models trained on the age-diverse dataset demonstrated
fairer performance across age groups, improved overall accuracy, and higher
generalization across datasets. This study contributes a reproducible,
fairness-aware deepfake dataset and model pipeline that can serve as a
foundation for future research in fairer deepfake detection. The complete
dataset and implementation code are available at

across diverse domains, yet solutions for personalized fashion styling remain
underexplored, which holds immense promise for promoting shopping experiences.
In this work, we present StyleTailor, the first collaborative agent framework
that seamlessly unifies personalized apparel design, shopping recommendation,
virtual try-on, and systematic evaluation into a cohesive workflow. To this
end, StyleTailor pioneers an iterative visual refinement paradigm driven by
multi-level negative feedback, enabling adaptive and precise user alignment.
Specifically, our framework features two core agents, i.e., Designer for
personalized garment selection and Consultant for virtual try-on, whose outputs
are progressively refined via hierarchical vision-language model feedback
spanning individual items, complete outfits, and try-on efficacy.
Counterexamples are aggregated into negative prompts, forming a closed-loop
mechanism that enhances recommendation quality.To assess the performance, we
introduce a comprehensive evaluation suite encompassing style consistency,
visual quality, face similarity, and artistic appraisal. Extensive experiments
demonstrate StyleTailor's superior performance in delivering personalized
designs and recommendations, outperforming strong baselines without negative
feedback and establishing a new benchmark for intelligent fashion systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种半自动化的标签错误校正框架REC✓D，通过结合现有检测器和众包微任务，显著提高了标注质量，并在KITTI数据集中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标检测数据集中普遍存在标签错误（如缺失、分类错误或定位不准确），影响训练和评估效果，但目前缺乏系统性的大规模校正方法。

Method: REC✓D框架结合现有错误检测器和众包微任务，通过多标注者独立验证候选框并聚合响应，估计模糊性并提升标注质量。

Result: 在KITTI数据集的“行人”类别中，校正后的标注显示原始标注中至少24%存在错误。框架显著提高了校正效率，但现有方法仍可能遗漏66%的真实错误。

Conclusion: REC✓D框架有效提升了标签校正效率和质量，但现有方法仍有改进空间，发布的基准数据集将推动进一步研究。

Abstract: Object detection has advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by increasingly
large and diverse datasets. However, label errors, defined as missing labels,
incorrect classification or inaccurate localization, often compromise the
quality of these datasets. This can have a significant impact on the outcomes
of training and benchmark evaluations. Although several methods now exist for
detecting label errors in object detection datasets, they are typically
validated only on synthetic benchmarks or limited manual inspection. How to
correct such errors systemically and at scale therefore remains an open
problem. We introduce a semi-automated framework for label-error correction
called REC$\checkmark$D (Rechecked). Building on existing detectors, the
framework pairs their error proposals with lightweight, crowd-sourced
microtasks. These tasks enable multiple annotators to independently verify each
candidate bounding box, and their responses are aggregated to estimate
ambiguity and improve label quality. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
REC$\checkmark$D, we apply it to the class pedestrian in the KITTI dataset. Our
crowdsourced review yields high-quality corrected annotations, which indicate a
rate of at least 24% of missing and inaccurate annotations in original
annotations. This validated set will be released as a new real-world benchmark
for label error detection and correction. We show that current label error
detection methods, when combined with our correction framework, can recover
hundreds of errors in the time it would take a human to annotate bounding boxes
from scratch. However, even the best methods still miss up to 66% of the true
errors and with low quality labels introduce more errors than they find. This
highlights the urgent need for further research, now enabled by our released
benchmark.

### [17] [On the effectiveness of multimodal privileged knowledge distillation in two vision transformer based diagnostic applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06558)
*Simon Baur,Alexandra Benova,Emilio Dolgener Cantú,Jackie Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态特权知识蒸馏（MMPKD）方法，利用训练时额外的模态数据指导单模态视觉模型，提升注意力图的零样本能力，但效果不跨域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实践中部署深度学习模型常需多模态数据，但推理时并非所有模态都可用，因此需要一种方法利用训练时的额外模态提升单模态模型性能。

Method: 提出MMPKD训练策略，使用文本和表格元数据作为教师模型（分别针对胸片和乳腺X光片），将知识蒸馏到视觉Transformer学生模型中。

Result: MMPKD提升了注意力图的零样本定位能力，但效果仅限于特定领域，未能跨域泛化。

Conclusion: MMPKD能有效利用训练时的多模态数据提升单模态模型性能，但需注意其领域局限性。

Abstract: Deploying deep learning models in clinical practice often requires leveraging
multiple data modalities, such as images, text, and structured data, to achieve
robust and trustworthy decisions. However, not all modalities are always
available at inference time. In this work, we propose multimodal privileged
knowledge distillation (MMPKD), a training strategy that utilizes additional
modalities available solely during training to guide a unimodal vision model.
Specifically, we used a text-based teacher model for chest radiographs
(MIMIC-CXR) and a tabular metadata-based teacher model for mammography
(CBIS-DDSM) to distill knowledge into a vision transformer student model. We
show that MMPKD can improve the resulting attention maps' zero-shot
capabilities of localizing ROI in input images, while this effect does not
generalize across domains, as contrarily suggested by prior research.

Result: 在IEMOCAP和MELD数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: VEGA机制通过心理学对齐的表示空间显著提升了多模态情感识别的效果。

Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversations remains a challenging task
due to the complex interplay of textual, acoustic and visual signals. While
recent models have improved performance via advanced fusion strategies, they
often lack psychologically meaningful priors to guide multimodal alignment. In
this paper, we revisit the use of CLIP and propose a novel Visual Emotion
Guided Anchoring (VEGA) mechanism that introduces class-level visual semantics
into the fusion and classification process. Distinct from prior work that
primarily utilizes CLIP's textual encoder, our approach leverages its image
encoder to construct emotion-specific visual anchors based on facial exemplars.
These anchors guide unimodal and multimodal features toward a perceptually
grounded and psychologically aligned representation space, drawing inspiration
from cognitive theories (prototypical emotion categories and multisensory
integration). A stochastic anchor sampling strategy further enhances robustness
by balancing semantic stability and intra-class diversity. Integrated into a
dual-branch architecture with self-distillation, our VEGA-augmented model
achieves sota performance on IEMOCAP and MELD. Code is available at:

Abstract: Integrating brain imaging data with clinical reports offers a valuable
opportunity to leverage complementary multimodal information for more effective
and timely diagnosis in practical clinical settings. This approach has gained
significant attention in brain disorder research, yet a key challenge remains:
how to effectively link objective imaging data with subjective text-based
reports, such as doctors' notes. In this work, we propose a novel framework
that aligns brain connectomes with clinical reports in a shared cross-modal
latent space at both the subject and connectome levels, thereby enhancing
representation learning. The key innovation of our approach is that we treat
brain subnetworks as tokens of imaging data, rather than raw image patches, to
align with word tokens in clinical reports. This enables a more efficient
identification of system-level associations between neuroimaging findings and
clinical observations, which is critical since brain disorders often manifest
as network-level abnormalities rather than isolated regional alterations. We
applied our method to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using the ADNI dataset.
Our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance but also
identifies clinically meaningful connectome-text pairs, offering new insights
into the early mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease and supporting the development
of clinically useful multimodal biomarkers.

TL;DR: Surformer v1是一种基于Transformer的架构，结合触觉和视觉输入，用于表面材料分类，在准确性和计算效率之间取得了良好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表面材料识别是机器人感知和物理交互的关键，尤其是在结合触觉和视觉输入时。

Method: 提出Surformer v1，结合触觉特征和视觉嵌入，使用模态特定编码器和跨模态注意力层。

Result: Surformer v1在准确率（99.4%）和推理时间（0.77 ms）上表现优异，优于其他模型。

Conclusion: Surformer v1在表面材料识别中提供了高准确性和计算效率的平衡。

Abstract: Surface material recognition is a key component in robotic perception and
physical interaction, particularly when leveraging both tactile and visual
sensory inputs. In this work, we propose Surformer v1, a transformer-based
architecture designed for surface classification using structured tactile
features and PCA-reduced visual embeddings extracted via ResNet-50. The model
integrates modality-specific encoders with cross-modal attention layers,
enabling rich interactions between vision and touch. Currently,
state-of-the-art deep learning models for vision tasks have achieved remarkable
performance. With this in mind, our first set of experiments focused
exclusively on tactile-only surface classification. Using feature engineering,
we trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models, assessing their
accuracy and inference time. We then implemented an encoder-only Transformer
model tailored for tactile features. This model not only achieved the highest
accuracy but also demonstrated significantly faster inference time compared to
other evaluated models, highlighting its potential for real-time applications.
To extend this investigation, we introduced a multimodal fusion setup by
combining vision and tactile inputs. We trained both Surformer v1 (using
structured features) and Multimodal CNN (using raw images) to examine the
impact of feature-based versus image-based multimodal learning on
classification accuracy and computational efficiency. The results showed that
Surformer v1 achieved 99.4% accuracy with an inference time of 0.77 ms, while
the Multimodal CNN achieved slightly higher accuracy but required significantly
more inference time. These findings suggest Surformer v1 offers a compelling
balance between accuracy, efficiency, and computational cost for surface
material recognition.

Abstract: The existing research has primarily focused on text and image-based hate
speech detection, video-based approaches remain underexplored. In this work, we
introduce a novel dataset, ImpliHateVid, specifically curated for implicit hate
speech detection in videos. ImpliHateVid consists of 2,009 videos comprising
509 implicit hate videos, 500 explicit hate videos, and 1,000 non-hate videos,
making it one of the first large-scale video datasets dedicated to implicit
hate detection. We also propose a novel two-stage contrastive learning
framework for hate speech detection in videos. In the first stage, we train
modality-specific encoders for audio, text, and image using contrastive loss by
concatenating features from the three encoders. In the second stage, we train
cross-encoders using contrastive learning to refine multimodal representations.
Additionally, we incorporate sentiment, emotion, and caption-based features to
enhance implicit hate detection. We evaluate our method on two datasets,
ImpliHateVid for implicit hate speech detection and another dataset for general
hate speech detection in videos, HateMM dataset, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the proposed multimodal contrastive learning for hateful
content detection in videos and the significance of our dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出ContextGuard-LVLM框架，利用视觉-语言大模型和多阶段上下文推理机制，解决数字新闻中视觉与文本信息的细粒度一致性验证问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字新闻媒体的普及需要更强大的内容真实性验证方法，尤其是视觉与文本信息的细粒度一致性（FCCC）问题。传统方法难以解决这一问题。

Method: 基于视觉-语言大模型（LVLMs），结合多阶段上下文推理机制，并通过强化或对抗学习增强模型能力。扩展了三个数据集，新增细粒度标注。

Result: ContextGuard-LVLM在细粒度一致性任务上显著优于零样本基线模型（如InstructBLIP和LLaVA 1.5），且在复杂逻辑推理和上下文理解方面表现更优。

Conclusion: ContextGuard-LVLM能够有效检测复杂的上下文不一致性，并在对抗扰动和人类专家判断中表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The proliferation of digital news media necessitates robust methods for
verifying content veracity, particularly regarding the consistency between
visual and textual information. Traditional approaches often fall short in
addressing the fine-grained cross-modal contextual consistency (FCCC) problem,
which encompasses deeper alignment of visual narrative, emotional tone, and
background information with text, beyond mere entity matching. To address this,
we propose ContextGuard-LVLM, a novel framework built upon advanced
Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) and integrating a multi-stage contextual
reasoning mechanism. Our model is uniquely enhanced through reinforced or
adversarial learning paradigms, enabling it to detect subtle contextual
misalignments that evade zero-shot baselines. We extend and augment three
established datasets (TamperedNews-Ent, News400-Ent, MMG-Ent) with new
fine-grained contextual annotations, including "contextual sentiment," "visual
narrative theme," and "scene-event logical coherence," and introduce a
comprehensive CTXT (Contextual Coherence) entity type. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that ContextGuard-LVLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
zero-shot LVLM baselines (InstructBLIP and LLaVA 1.5) across nearly all
fine-grained consistency tasks, showing significant improvements in complex
logical reasoning and nuanced contextual understanding. Furthermore, our model
exhibits superior robustness to subtle perturbations and a higher agreement
rate with human expert judgments on challenging samples, affirming its efficacy
in discerning sophisticated forms of context detachment.

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of skin diseases remains a significant challenge due to
the complex and diverse visual features present in dermatoscopic images, often
compounded by a lack of interpretability in existing purely visual diagnostic
models. To address these limitations, this study introduces VL-MedGuide
(Visual-Linguistic Medical Guide), a novel framework leveraging the powerful
multi-modal understanding and reasoning capabilities of Visual-Language Large
Models (LVLMs) for intelligent and inherently interpretable auxiliary diagnosis
of skin conditions. VL-MedGuide operates in two interconnected stages: a
Multi-modal Concept Perception Module, which identifies and linguistically
describes dermatologically relevant visual features through sophisticated
prompt engineering, and an Explainable Disease Reasoning Module, which
integrates these concepts with raw visual information via Chain-of-Thought
prompting to provide precise disease diagnoses alongside transparent
rationales. Comprehensive experiments on the Derm7pt dataset demonstrate that
VL-MedGuide achieves state-of-the-art performance in both disease diagnosis
(83.55% BACC, 80.12% F1) and concept detection (76.10% BACC, 67.45% F1),
surpassing existing baselines. Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the high
clarity, completeness, and trustworthiness of its generated explanations,
bridging the gap between AI performance and clinical utility by offering
actionable, explainable insights for dermatological practice.

Abstract: We introduce a diffusion-based cross-domain image translator in the absence
of paired training data. Unlike GAN-based methods, our approach integrates
diffusion models to learn the image translation process, allowing for more
coverable modeling of the data distribution and performance improvement of the
cross-domain translation. However, incorporating the translation process within
the diffusion process is still challenging since the two processes are not
aligned exactly, i.e., the diffusion process is applied to the noisy signal
while the translation process is conducted on the clean signal. As a result,
recent diffusion-based studies employ separate training or shallow integration
to learn the two processes, yet this may cause the local minimal of the
translation optimization, constraining the effectiveness of diffusion models.
To address the problem, we propose a novel joint learning framework that aligns
the diffusion and the translation process, thereby improving the global
optimality. Specifically, we propose to extract the image components with
diffusion models to represent the clean signal and employ the translation
process with the image components, enabling an end-to-end joint learning
manner. On the other hand, we introduce a time-dependent translation network to
learn the complex translation mapping, resulting in effective translation
learning and significant performance improvement. Benefiting from the design of
joint learning, our method enables global optimization of both processes,
enhancing the optimality and achieving improved fidelity and structural
consistency. We have conducted extensive experiments on RGB$\leftrightarrow$RGB
and diverse cross-modality translation tasks including
RGB$\leftrightarrow$Edge, RGB$\leftrightarrow$Semantics and
RGB$\leftrightarrow$Depth, showcasing better generative performances than the
state of the arts.

Conclusion: 该分解范式为神经场景表示中的复杂外观建模提供了灵活有效的方向。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown impressive performance in novel view
synthesis, but challenges remain in rendering scenes with complex specular
reflections and highlights. Existing approaches may produce blurry reflections
due to entanglement between lighting and material properties, or encounter
optimization instability when relying on physically-based inverse rendering. In
this work, we present a neural rendering framework based on dynamic coefficient
decomposition, aiming to improve the modeling of view-dependent appearance. Our
approach decomposes complex appearance into a shared, static neural basis that
encodes intrinsic material properties, and a set of dynamic coefficients
generated by a Coefficient Network conditioned on view and illumination. A
Dynamic Radiance Integrator then combines these components to synthesize the
final radiance. Experimental results on several challenging benchmarks suggest
that our method can produce sharper and more realistic specular highlights
compared to existing techniques. We hope that this decomposition paradigm can
provide a flexible and effective direction for modeling complex appearance in
neural scene representations.

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is a highly challenging task in affective
computing. With the reduced-sized micro-expression (ME) input that contains key
information based on key-frame indexes, key-frame-based methods have
significantly improved the performance of MER. However, most of these methods
focus on improving the performance with relatively accurate key-frame indexes,
while ignoring the difficulty of obtaining accurate key-frame indexes and the
objective existence of key-frame index errors, which impedes them from moving
towards practical applications. In this paper, we propose CausalNet, a novel
framework to achieve robust MER facing key-frame index errors while maintaining
accurate recognition. To enhance robustness, CausalNet takes the representation
of the entire ME sequence as the input. To address the information redundancy
brought by the complete ME range input and maintain accurate recognition,
first, the Causal Motion Position Learning Module (CMPLM) is proposed to help
the model locate the muscle movement areas related to Action Units (AUs),
thereby reducing the attention to other redundant areas. Second, the Causal
Attention Block (CAB) is proposed to deeply learn the causal relationships
between the muscle contraction and relaxation movements in MEs. Empirical
experiments have demonstrated that on popular ME benchmarks, the CausalNet has
achieved robust MER under different levels of key-frame index noise. Meanwhile,
it has surpassed state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on several standard MER
benchmarks when using the provided annotated key-frames. Code is available at

Abstract: Image segmentation plays a crucial role in extracting objects of interest and
identifying their boundaries within an image. However, accurate segmentation
becomes challenging when dealing with occlusions, obscurities, or noise in
corrupted images. To tackle this challenge, prior information is often
utilized, with recent attention on star-shape priors. In this paper, we propose
a star-shape segmentation model based on the registration framework. By
combining the level set representation with the registration framework and
imposing constraints on the deformed level set function, our model enables both
full and partial star-shape segmentation, accommodating single or multiple
centers. Additionally, our approach allows for the enforcement of identified
boundaries to pass through specified landmark locations. We tackle the proposed
models using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Through numerical
experiments conducted on synthetic and real images, we demonstrate the efficacy
of our approach in achieving accurate star-shape segmentation.

Abstract: In-generation watermarking for detecting and attributing generated content
has recently been explored for latent diffusion models (LDMs), demonstrating
high robustness. However, the use of in-generation watermarks in autoregressive
(AR) image models has not been explored yet. AR models generate images by
autoregressively predicting a sequence of visual tokens that are then decoded
into pixels using a vector-quantized decoder. Inspired by red-green watermarks
for large language models, we examine token-level watermarking schemes that
bias the next-token prediction based on prior tokens. We find that a direct
transfer of these schemes works in principle, but the detectability of the
watermarks decreases considerably under common image perturbations. As a
remedy, we propose two novel watermarking methods that rely on visual token
clustering to assign similar tokens to the same set. Firstly, we investigate a
training-free approach that relies on a cluster lookup table, and secondly, we
finetune VAE encoders to predict token clusters directly from perturbed images.
Overall, our experiments show that cluster-level watermarks improve robustness
against perturbations and regeneration attacks while preserving image quality.
Cluster classification further boosts watermark detectability, outperforming a
set of baselines. Moreover, our methods offer fast verification runtime,
comparable to lightweight post-hoc watermarking methods.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in computer vision, modern recognition systems
remain limited by their dependence on rich, redundant visual inputs. In
contrast, humans can effortlessly understand sparse, minimal representations
like line drawings - suggesting that structure, rather than appearance,
underlies efficient visual understanding. In this work, we propose using line
drawings as a structure-first pretraining modality to induce more compact and
generalizable visual representations. We show that models pretrained on line
drawings develop stronger shape bias, more focused attention, and greater data
efficiency across classification, detection, and segmentation tasks. Notably,
these models also exhibit lower intrinsic dimensionality, requiring
significantly fewer principal components to capture representational variance -
echoing the similar observation in low dimensional efficient representation in
the brain. Beyond performance improvements, line drawing pretraining produces
more compressible representations, enabling better distillation into
lightweight student models. Students distilled from line-pretrained teachers
consistently outperform those trained from color-supervised teachers,
highlighting the benefits of structurally compact knowledge. Finally, we
demonstrate that the pretraining with line-drawing can also be extended to
unsupervised setting via our proposed method "learning to draw". Together, our
results support the view that structure-first visual learning fosters
efficiency, generalization, and human-aligned inductive biases - offering a
simple yet powerful strategy for building more robust and adaptable vision
systems.

Result: 在两个大规模数据集上表现优异，F1-Score分别提升13.92%和7.74%。

Conclusion: MMFformer在多模态抑郁症检测中表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: Depression is a serious mental health illness that significantly affects an
individual's well-being and quality of life, making early detection crucial for
adequate care and treatment. Detecting depression is often difficult, as it is
based primarily on subjective evaluations during clinical interviews. Hence,
the early diagnosis of depression, thanks to the content of social networks,
has become a prominent research area. The extensive and diverse nature of
user-generated information poses a significant challenge, limiting the accurate
extraction of relevant temporal information and the effective fusion of data
across multiple modalities. This paper introduces MMFformer, a multimodal
depression detection network designed to retrieve depressive spatio-temporal
high-level patterns from multimodal social media information. The transformer
network with residual connections captures spatial features from videos, and a
transformer encoder is exploited to design important temporal dynamics in
audio. Moreover, the fusion architecture fused the extracted features through
late and intermediate fusion strategies to find out the most relevant
intermodal correlations among them. Finally, the proposed network is assessed
on two large-scale depression detection datasets, and the results clearly
reveal that it surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches, improving the
F1-Score by 13.92% for D-Vlog dataset and 7.74% for LMVD dataset. The code is

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) is a promising method that modulates
user-defined waveforms with digital holograms. An efficient and fast pipeline
framework is proposed to synthesize CGH using initial point cloud and MRI data.
This input data is reconstructed into volumetric objects that are then input
into non-convex Fourier optics optimization algorithms for phase-only hologram
(POH) and complex-hologram (CH) generation using alternating projection, SGD,
and quasi-Netwton methods. Comparison of reconstruction performance of these
algorithms as measured by MSE, RMSE, and PSNR is analyzed as well as to HoloNet
deep learning CGH. Performance metrics are shown to be improved by using 2D
median filtering to remove artifacts and speckled noise during optimization.

Abstract: Creating deformable 3D content has gained increasing attention with the rise
of text-to-image and image-to-video generative models. While these models
provide rich semantic priors for appearance, they struggle to capture the
physical realism and motion dynamics needed for authentic 4D scene synthesis.
In contrast, real-world videos can provide physically grounded geometry and
articulation cues that are difficult to hallucinate. One question is raised:
\textit{Can we generate physically consistent 4D content by leveraging the
motion priors of the real-world video}? In this work, we explore the task of
reanimating deformable 3D scenes from a single video, using the original
sequence as a supervisory signal to correct artifacts from synthetic motion. We
introduce \textbf{Restage4D}, a geometry-preserving pipeline for
video-conditioned 4D restaging. Our approach uses a video-rewinding training
strategy to temporally bridge a real base video and a synthetic driving video
via a shared motion representation. We further incorporate an occlusion-aware
rigidity loss and a disocclusion backtracing mechanism to improve structural
and geometry consistency under challenging motion. We validate Restage4D on
DAVIS and PointOdyssey, demonstrating improved geometry consistency, motion
quality, and 3D tracking performance. Our method not only preserves deformable
structure under novel motion, but also automatically corrects errors introduced
by generative models, revealing the potential of video prior in 4D restaging
task. Source code and trained models will be released.

Result: 在1705名患者的多样本多中心验证中，模型在多个独立测试集上的AUC为65.41%至90.58%，显著优于基线方法（p ≤ 0.05）。

Conclusion: FoundBioNet通过大规模预训练和任务特定微调，实现了可推广的胶质瘤表征，提高了诊断准确性和可解释性，有望推动个性化治疗。

Abstract: Accurate, noninvasive detection of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation is
essential for effective glioma management. Traditional methods rely on invasive
tissue sampling, which may fail to capture a tumor's spatial heterogeneity.
While deep learning models have shown promise in molecular profiling, their
performance is often limited by scarce annotated data. In contrast, foundation
deep learning models offer a more generalizable approach for glioma imaging
biomarkers. We propose a Foundation-based Biomarker Network (FoundBioNet) that
utilizes a SWIN-UNETR-based architecture to noninvasively predict IDH mutation
status from multi-parametric MRI. Two key modules are incorporated: Tumor-Aware
Feature Encoding (TAFE) for extracting multi-scale, tumor-focused features, and
Cross-Modality Differential (CMD) for highlighting subtle T2-FLAIR mismatch
signals associated with IDH mutation. The model was trained and validated on a
diverse, multi-center cohort of 1705 glioma patients from six public datasets.
Our model achieved AUCs of 90.58%, 88.08%, 65.41%, and 80.31% on independent
test sets from EGD, TCGA, Ivy GAP, RHUH, and UPenn, consistently outperforming
baseline approaches (p <= 0.05). Ablation studies confirmed that both the TAFE
and CMD modules are essential for improving predictive accuracy. By integrating
large-scale pretraining and task-specific fine-tuning, FoundBioNet enables
generalizable glioma characterization. This approach enhances diagnostic
accuracy and interpretability, with the potential to enable more personalized
patient care.

Motivation: 现有方法在复杂姿态或严重遮挡场景下表现不佳，且现有遮挡数据集缺乏真实性。

Method: 使用计算机图形渲染技术构建VOccl3D数据集，并微调CLIFF和BEDLAM-CLIFF方法。

Result: 在多个公共数据集和VOccl3D测试集上，方法表现出显著提升，并改进了YOLO11检测器。

Conclusion: VOccl3D为未来遮挡研究提供了更真实的基准资源。

Abstract: Human pose and shape (HPS) estimation methods have been extensively studied,
with many demonstrating high zero-shot performance on in-the-wild images and
videos. However, these methods often struggle in challenging scenarios
involving complex human poses or significant occlusions. Although some studies
address 3D human pose estimation under occlusion, they typically evaluate
performance on datasets that lack realistic or substantial occlusions, e.g.,
most existing datasets introduce occlusions with random patches over the human
or clipart-style overlays, which may not reflect real-world challenges. To
bridge this gap in realistic occlusion datasets, we introduce a novel benchmark
dataset, VOccl3D, a Video-based human Occlusion dataset with 3D body pose and
shape annotations. Inspired by works such as AGORA and BEDLAM, we constructed
this dataset using advanced computer graphics rendering techniques,
incorporating diverse real-world occlusion scenarios, clothing textures, and
human motions. Additionally, we fine-tuned recent HPS methods, CLIFF and
BEDLAM-CLIFF, on our dataset, demonstrating significant qualitative and
quantitative improvements across multiple public datasets, as well as on the
test split of our dataset, while comparing its performance with other
state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we leveraged our dataset to enhance
human detection performance under occlusion by fine-tuning an existing object
detector, YOLO11, thus leading to a robust end-to-end HPS estimation system
under occlusions. Overall, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for
future research aimed at benchmarking methods designed to handle occlusions,
offering a more realistic alternative to existing occlusion datasets. See the

Result: 实验表明，SafePLUG在区域问答、像素级分割、时间事件定位和事故理解等任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: SafePLUG为复杂交通场景的细粒度理解奠定了基础，有望提升智能交通系统的安全性和情境感知能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress
across a range of vision-language tasks and demonstrate strong potential for
traffic accident understanding. However, existing MLLMs in this domain
primarily focus on coarse-grained image-level or video-level comprehension and
often struggle to handle fine-grained visual details or localized scene
components, limiting their applicability in complex accident scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose SafePLUG, a novel framework that empowers
MLLMs with both Pixel-Level Understanding and temporal Grounding for
comprehensive traffic accident analysis. SafePLUG supports both
arbitrary-shaped visual prompts for region-aware question answering and
pixel-level segmentation based on language instructions, while also enabling
the recognition of temporally anchored events in traffic accident scenarios. To
advance the development of MLLMs for traffic accident understanding, we curate
a new dataset containing multimodal question-answer pairs centered on diverse
accident scenarios, with detailed pixel-level annotations and temporal event
boundaries. Experimental results show that SafePLUG achieves strong performance
on multiple tasks, including region-based question answering, pixel-level
segmentation, temporal event localization, and accident event understanding.
These capabilities lay a foundation for fine-grained understanding of complex
traffic scenes, with the potential to improve driving safety and enhance
situational awareness in smart transportation systems. The code, dataset, and
model checkpoints will be made publicly available at:

Conclusion: DiffUS为术前规划和术中引导提供了桥梁，支持基于梯度的优化应用。

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound imaging provides real-time guidance during numerous
surgical procedures, but its interpretation is complicated by noise, artifacts,
and poor alignment with high-resolution preoperative MRI/CT scans. To bridge
the gap between reoperative planning and intraoperative guidance, we present
DiffUS, a physics-based, differentiable ultrasound renderer that synthesizes
realistic B-mode images from volumetric imaging. DiffUS first converts MRI 3D
scans into acoustic impedance volumes using a machine learning approach. Next,
we simulate ultrasound beam propagation using ray tracing with coupled
reflection-transmission equations. DiffUS formulates wave propagation as a
sparse linear system that captures multiple internal reflections. Finally, we
reconstruct B-mode images via depth-resolved echo extraction across fan-shaped
acquisition geometry, incorporating realistic artifacts including speckle noise
and depth-dependent degradation. DiffUS is entirely implemented as
differentiable tensor operations in PyTorch, enabling gradient-based
optimization for downstream applications such as slice-to-volume registration
and volumetric reconstruction. Evaluation on the ReMIND dataset demonstrates
DiffUS's ability to generate anatomically accurate ultrasound images from brain
MRI data.

Result: 在CT和MRI数据集上，边界定位显著优于基线方法，下游任务（分割、配准）性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法生成的精确边缘对医学成像任务具有重要临床价值。

Abstract: Accurate localization of organ boundaries is critical in medical imaging for
segmentation, registration, surgical planning, and radiotherapy. While deep
convolutional networks (ConvNets) have advanced general-purpose edge detection
to near-human performance on natural images, their outputs often lack precise
localization, a limitation that is particularly harmful in medical applications
where millimeter-level accuracy is required. Building on a systematic analysis
of ConvNet edge outputs, we propose a medically focused crisp edge detector
that adapts a novel top-down backward refinement architecture to medical images
(2D and volumetric). Our method progressively upsamples and fuses high-level
semantic features with fine-grained low-level cues through a backward
refinement pathway, producing high-resolution, well-localized organ boundaries.
We further extend the design to handle anisotropic volumes by combining 2D
slice-wise refinement with light 3D context aggregation to retain computational
efficiency. Evaluations on several CT and MRI organ datasets demonstrate
substantially improved boundary localization under strict criteria (boundary
F-measure, Hausdorff distance) compared to baseline ConvNet detectors and
contemporary medical edge/contour methods. Importantly, integrating our crisp
edge maps into downstream pipelines yields consistent gains in organ
segmentation (higher Dice scores, lower boundary errors), more accurate image
registration, and improved delineation of lesions near organ interfaces. The
proposed approach produces clinically valuable, crisp organ edges that
materially enhance common medical-imaging tasks.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of melanocytic tumors in dermoscopic images is a
critical step for automated skin cancer screening and clinical decision
support. Unlike natural scene segmentation, lesion delineation must reconcile
subtle texture and color variations, frequent artifacts (hairs, rulers,
bubbles), and a strong need for precise boundary localization to support
downstream diagnosis. In this paper we introduce Our method, a novel ResNet
inspired dual resolution architecture specifically designed for melanocytic
tumor segmentation. Our method maintains a full resolution stream that
preserves fine grained boundary information while a complementary pooled stream
aggregates multi scale contextual cues for robust lesion recognition. The
streams are tightly coupled by boundary aware residual connections that inject
high frequency edge information into deep feature maps, and by a channel
attention module that adapts color and texture sensitivity to dermoscopic
appearance. To further address common imaging artifacts and the limited size of
clinical datasets, we propose a lightweight artifact suppression block and a
multi task training objective that combines a Dice Tversky segmentation loss
with an explicit boundary loss and a contrastive regularizer for feature
stability. The combined design yields pixel accurate masks without requiring
heavy post processing or complex pre training protocols. Extensive experiments
on public dermoscopic benchmarks demonstrate that Our method significantly
improves boundary adherence and clinically relevant segmentation metrics
compared to standard encoder decoder baselines, making it a practical building
block for automated melanoma assessment systems.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of subcutaneous vessels from clinical images is
hampered by scarce, expensive ground truth and by low contrast, noisy
appearance of vessels across patients and modalities. We present a novel weakly
supervised training framework tailored for subcutaneous vessel segmentation
that leverages inexpensive sparse annotations (e.g., centerline traces, dot
markers, or short scribbles). Sparse labels are expanded into dense,
probabilistic supervision via a differentiable random walk label propagation
model whose transition weights incorporate image driven vesselness cues and
tubular continuity priors. The propagation yields per-pixel hitting
probabilities together with calibrated uncertainty estimates; these are
incorporated into an uncertainty weighted loss to avoid over fitting to
ambiguous regions. Crucially, the label-propagator is learned jointly with a
CNN based segmentation predictor, enabling the system to discover vessel edges
and continuity constraints without explicit edge supervision. We further
introduce a topology aware regularizer that encourages centerline connectivity
and penalizes spurious branches, improving clinical usability. In experiments
on clinical subcutaneous imaging datasets, our method consistently outperforms
naive training on sparse labels and conventional dense pseudo-labeling,
producing more complete vascular maps and better calibrated uncertainty for
downstream decision making. The approach substantially reduces annotation
burden while preserving clinically relevant vessel topology.

Motivation: 解决多源域自适应（MSDA）方法中训练参数和计算成本高的问题，同时保持高准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SAGE-reID是一种高效、轻量级的MSDA方法，适用于跨域行人重识别任务。

Abstract: Adapting person re-identification (reID) models to new target environments
remains a challenging problem that is typically addressed using unsupervised
domain adaptation (UDA) methods. Recent works show that when labeled data
originates from several distinct sources (e.g., datasets and cameras),
considering each source separately and applying multi-source domain adaptation
(MSDA) typically yields higher accuracy and robustness compared to blending the
sources and performing conventional UDA. However, state-of-the-art MSDA methods
learn domain-specific backbone models or require access to source domain data
during adaptation, resulting in significant growth in training parameters and
computational cost. In this paper, a Source-free Adaptive Gated Experts
(SAGE-reID) method is introduced for person reID. Our SAGE-reID is a
cost-effective, source-free MSDA method that first trains individual
source-specific low-rank adapters (LoRA) through source-free UDA. Next, a
lightweight gating network is introduced and trained to dynamically assign
optimal merging weights for fusion of LoRA experts, enabling effective
cross-domain knowledge transfer. While the number of backbone parameters
remains constant across source domains, LoRA experts scale linearly but remain
negligible in size (<= 2% of the backbone), reducing both the memory
consumption and risk of overfitting. Extensive experiments conducted on three
challenging benchmarks: Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and MSMT17 indicate that
SAGE-reID outperforms state-of-the-art methods while being computationally
efficient.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of accurately forecasting geometric

Despite progress in modern manufacturing, maintaining dimensional precision
remains difficult, particularly for complex geometries. We present a
methodology that employs a high-resolution 3D scanner to acquire multi-angle
surface data from 237 components produced across different batches. The data
were processed through precise alignment, noise reduction, and merging
techniques to generate accurate 3D representations. A hybrid machine learning
framework was developed, combining convolutional neural networks for feature
extraction with gradient-boosted decision trees for predictive modeling. The
proposed system achieved a prediction accuracy of 0.012 mm at a 95% confidence
level, representing a 73% improvement over conventional statistical process
control methods. In addition to improved accuracy, the model revealed hidden
correlations between manufacturing parameters and geometric deviations. This
approach offers significant potential for automated quality control, predictive
maintenance, and design optimization in precision manufacturing, and the
resulting dataset provides a strong foundation for future predictive modeling
research.

Abstract: Multiview clustering (MC) aims to group samples using consistent and
complementary information across various views. The subspace clustering, as a
fundamental technique of MC, has attracted significant attention. In this
paper, we propose a novel joint sparse self-representation learning model for
MC, where a featured difference is the extraction of view-specific local
information by introducing cardinality (i.e., $\ell_0$-norm) constraints
instead of Graph-Laplacian regularization. Specifically, under each view,
cardinality constraints directly restrict the samples used in the
self-representation stage to extract reliable local and global structure
information, while the low-rank constraint aids in revealing a global coherent
structure in the consensus affinity matrix during merging. The attendant
challenge is that Augmented Lagrange Method (ALM)-based alternating
minimization algorithms cannot guarantee convergence when applied directly to
our nonconvex, nonsmooth model, thus resulting in poor generalization ability.
To address it, we develop an alternating quadratic penalty (AQP) method with
global convergence, where two subproblems are iteratively solved by closed-form
solutions. Empirical results on six standard datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our model and AQP method, compared to eight state-of-the-art
algorithms.

TL;DR: VSI提出了一种结合视觉和字幕的多模态关键帧搜索方法，显著提升了长视频理解和问答任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解因数据规模庞大而具有挑战性，现有方法因多模态对齐不足和复杂时间语义信息缺失而效果有限。

Method: VSI通过双流搜索机制（视频搜索流和字幕匹配流）整合视觉、字幕和时间信息，提升关键帧搜索精度。

Result: VSI在LongVideoBench上关键帧定位准确率达40.00%，视频问答任务准确率达68.48%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: VSI在长视频问答任务中达到SOTA，验证了其多模态搜索策略的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Long video understanding presents a significant challenge to multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) primarily due to the immense data scale. A critical and
widely adopted strategy for making this task computationally tractable is
keyframe retrieval, which seeks to identify a sparse set of video frames that
are most salient to a given textual query. However, the efficacy of this
approach is hindered by weak multimodal alignment between textual queries and
visual content and fails to capture the complex temporal semantic information
required for precise reasoning. To address this, we propose Visual-Subtitle
Integeration(VSI), a multimodal keyframe search method that integrates
subtitles, timestamps, and scene boundaries into a unified multimodal search
process. The proposed method captures the visual information of video frames as
well as the complementary textual information through a dual-stream search
mechanism by Video Search Stream as well as Subtitle Match Stream,
respectively, and improves the keyframe search accuracy through the interaction
of the two search streams. Experimental results show that VSI achieve 40.00%
key frame localization accuracy on the text-relevant subset of LongVideoBench
and 68.48% accuracy on downstream long Video-QA tasks, surpassing competitive
baselines by 20.35% and 15.79%, respectively. Furthermore, on the
LongVideoBench, VSI achieved state-of-the-art(SOTA) in medium-to-long video-QA
tasks, demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of the proposed
multimodal search strategy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型噪声抑制特征金字塔网络（NS-FPN），通过低频引导特征净化（LFP）和螺旋感知特征采样（SFS）模块，显著减少红外小目标检测中的误报问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外小目标检测因目标暗淡、形状模糊及背景干扰而极具挑战性，现有CNN方法虽能增强特征表示但导致误报增加。

Method: 结合LFP模块抑制噪声特征和SFS模块螺旋采样融合目标相关特征，构建轻量高效的NS-FPN。

Result: 在公开数据集上验证，NS-FPN显著降低误报并提升检测性能。

Conclusion: NS-FPN为红外小目标检测提供了一种高效且易集成的解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection and segmentation (IRSTDS) is a critical yet
challenging task in defense and civilian applications, owing to the dim,
shapeless appearance of targets and severe background clutter. Recent CNN-based
methods have achieved promising target perception results, but they only focus
on enhancing feature representation to offset the impact of noise, which
results in the increased false alarms problem. In this paper, through analyzing
the problem from the frequency domain, we pioneer in improving performance from
noise suppression perspective and propose a novel noise-suppression feature
pyramid network (NS-FPN), which integrates a low-frequency guided feature
purification (LFP) module and a spiral-aware feature sampling (SFS) module into
the original FPN structure. The LFP module suppresses the noise features by
purifying high-frequency components to achieve feature enhancement devoid of
noise interference, while the SFS module further adopts spiral sampling to fuse
target-relevant features in feature fusion process. Our NS-FPN is designed to
be lightweight yet effective and can be easily plugged into existing IRSTDS
frameworks. Extensive experiments on the public IRSTDS datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly reduces false alarms and achieves superior
performance on IRSTDS tasks.

*Jianting Tang,Yubo Wang,Haoyu Cao,Linli Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出BASIC方法，通过直接监督视觉嵌入提升多模态大语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅将视觉嵌入作为上下文线索，缺乏直接视觉监督，限制了视觉嵌入的精细对齐。

Method: BASIC利用大语言模型浅层中优化的视觉嵌入作为监督，从嵌入方向和语义匹配两方面指导视觉投影器。

Result: BASIC显著提升了多模态大语言模型在多个基准测试中的性能。

Conclusion: 直接视觉监督是提升视觉嵌入对齐的有效方法。

Abstract: Mainstream Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve visual
understanding by using a vision projector to bridge well-pretrained vision
encoders and large language models (LLMs). The inherent gap between visual and
textual modalities makes the embeddings from the vision projector critical for
visual comprehension. However, current alignment approaches treat visual
embeddings as contextual cues and merely apply auto-regressive supervision to
textual outputs, neglecting the necessity of introducing equivalent direct
visual supervision, which hinders the potential finer alignment of visual
embeddings. In this paper, based on our analysis of the refinement process of
visual embeddings in the LLM's shallow layers, we propose BASIC, a method that
utilizes refined visual embeddings within the LLM as supervision to directly
guide the projector in generating initial visual embeddings. Specifically, the
guidance is conducted from two perspectives: (i) optimizing embedding
directions by reducing angles between initial and supervisory embeddings in
semantic space; (ii) improving semantic matching by minimizing disparities
between the logit distributions of both visual embeddings. Without additional
supervisory models or artificial annotations, BASIC significantly improves the
performance of MLLMs across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our introduced direct visual supervision.

Abstract: Chinese font generation aims to create a new Chinese font library based on
some reference samples. It is a topic of great concern to many font designers
and typographers. Over the past years, with the rapid development of deep
learning algorithms, various new techniques have achieved flourishing and
thriving progress. Nevertheless, how to improve the overall quality of
generated Chinese character images remains a tough issue. In this paper, we
conduct a holistic survey of the recent Chinese font generation approaches
based on deep learning. To be specific, we first illustrate the research
background of the task. Then, we outline our literature selection and analysis
methodology, and review a series of related fundamentals, including classical
deep learning architectures, font representation formats, public datasets, and
frequently-used evaluation metrics. After that, relying on the number of
reference samples required to generate a new font, we categorize the existing
methods into two major groups: many-shot font generation and few-shot font
generation methods. Within each category, representative approaches are
summarized, and their strengths and limitations are also discussed in detail.
Finally, we conclude our paper with the challenges and future directions, with
the expectation to provide some valuable illuminations for the researchers in
this field.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了eMotions数据集和AV-CANet网络，用于短视频情感分析，解决了多模态复杂性和情感表达不一致的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短视频情感分析面临数据稀缺和多模态复杂性挑战，需要高质量数据集和高效分析方法。

Method: 提出eMotions数据集和多阶段标注流程，设计AV-CANet网络，结合视频Transformer和局部-全局融合模块，优化EP-CE损失函数。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了AV-CANet的有效性，并通过消融实验分析了关键组件。

Conclusion: AV-CANet为短视频情感分析提供了有效解决方案，数据集和代码将开源。

Abstract: Short-form videos (SVs) have become a vital part of our online routine for
acquiring and sharing information. Their multimodal complexity poses new
challenges for video analysis, highlighting the need for video emotion analysis
(VEA) within the community. Given the limited availability of SVs emotion data,
we introduce eMotions, a large-scale dataset consisting of 27,996 videos with
full-scale annotations. To ensure quality and reduce subjective bias, we
emphasize better personnel allocation and propose a multi-stage annotation
procedure. Additionally, we provide the category-balanced and test-oriented
variants through targeted sampling to meet diverse needs. While there have been
significant studies on videos with clear emotional cues (e.g., facial
expressions), analyzing emotions in SVs remains a challenging task. The
challenge arises from the broader content diversity, which introduces more
distinct semantic gaps and complicates the representations learning of
emotion-related features. Furthermore, the prevalence of audio-visual
co-expressions in SVs leads to the local biases and collective information gaps
caused by the inconsistencies in emotional expressions. To tackle this, we
propose AV-CANet, an end-to-end audio-visual fusion network that leverages
video transformer to capture semantically relevant representations. We further
introduce the Local-Global Fusion Module designed to progressively capture the
correlations of audio-visual features. Besides, EP-CE Loss is constructed to
globally steer optimizations with tripolar penalties. Extensive experiments
across three eMotions-related datasets and four public VEA datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed AV-CANet, while providing broad insights for
future research. Moreover, we conduct ablation studies to examine the critical
components of our method. Dataset and code will be made available at Github.

*Chao Yin,Jide Li,Xiaoqiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需训练的实例感知提示框架（IAPF），通过生成细粒度实例掩码，显著提升了伪装目标分割（COS）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于训练的COS方法在标注稀疏时性能下降，而现有的无需训练方法仅能生成粗粒度的语义掩码，无法有效处理多个离散伪装实例。

Method: IAPF框架包括文本提示生成器、实例掩码生成器和自一致性实例掩码投票三部分，通过多模态大语言模型和Grounding DINO生成细粒度实例掩码。

Result: 在标准COS基准测试中，IAPF显著优于现有的无需训练方法。

Conclusion: IAPF为无需训练的COS提供了一种高效且强大的解决方案，能够处理复杂的伪装实例场景。

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS) remains highly challenging due to the
intrinsic visual similarity between target objects and their surroundings.
While training-based COS methods achieve good performance, their performance
degrades rapidly with increased annotation sparsity. To circumvent this
limitation, recent studies have explored training-free COS methods, leveraging
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) by automatically generating visual prompts
from a single task-generic prompt (\textit{e.g.}, "\textit{camouflaged
animal}") uniformly applied across all test images. However, these methods
typically produce only semantic-level visual prompts, causing SAM to output
coarse semantic masks and thus failing to handle scenarios with multiple
discrete camouflaged instances effectively. To address this critical
limitation, we propose a simple yet powerful \textbf{I}nstance-\textbf{A}ware
\textbf{P}rompting \textbf{F}ramework (IAPF), the first training-free COS
pipeline that explicitly converts a task-generic prompt into fine-grained
instance masks. Specifically, the IAPF comprises three steps: (1) Text Prompt
Generator, utilizing task-generic queries to prompt a Multimodal Large Language
Model (MLLM) for generating image-specific foreground and background tags; (2)
\textbf{Instance Mask Generator}, leveraging Grounding DINO to produce precise
instance-level bounding box prompts, alongside the proposed Single-Foreground
Multi-Background Prompting strategy to sample region-constrained point prompts
within each box, enabling SAM to yield a candidate instance mask; (3)
Self-consistency Instance Mask Voting, which selects the final COS prediction
by identifying the candidate mask most consistent across multiple candidate
instance masks. Extensive evaluations on standard COS benchmarks demonstrate
that the proposed IAPF significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art
training-free COS methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多参考图像生成任务，并构建了MultiRef-bench评估框架和MultiRef数据集，发现现有模型在多参考条件下表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像生成框架主要依赖单源输入（文本或单张参考图），而设计师通常需要从多张参考图中获取灵感，因此研究多参考图像生成任务具有重要意义。

Method: 通过RefBlend数据引擎生成990个合成样本和1,000个真实样本，构建MultiRef-bench评估框架，并在三种图像-文本模型和六种代理框架上进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，即使是先进模型（如OmniGen）在多参考条件下表现有限，合成样本准确率为66.6%，真实样本为79.0%。

Conclusion: 研究为开发更灵活、更接近人类创作能力的图像生成工具提供了方向，并公开了数据集MultiRef。

Abstract: Visual designers naturally draw inspiration from multiple visual references,
combining diverse elements and aesthetic principles to create artwork. However,
current image generative frameworks predominantly rely on single-source inputs
-- either text prompts or individual reference images. In this paper, we focus
on the task of controllable image generation using multiple visual references.
We introduce MultiRef-bench, a rigorous evaluation framework comprising 990
synthetic and 1,000 real-world samples that require incorporating visual
content from multiple reference images. The synthetic samples are synthetically
generated through our data engine RefBlend, with 10 reference types and 33
reference combinations. Based on RefBlend, we further construct a dataset
MultiRef containing 38k high-quality images to facilitate further research. Our
experiments across three interleaved image-text models (i.e., OmniGen, ACE, and
Show-o) and six agentic frameworks (e.g., ChatDiT and LLM + SD) reveal that
even state-of-the-art systems struggle with multi-reference conditioning, with
the best model OmniGen achieving only 66.6% in synthetic samples and 79.0% in
real-world cases on average compared to the golden answer. These findings
provide valuable directions for developing more flexible and human-like
creative tools that can effectively integrate multiple sources of visual
inspiration. The dataset is publicly available at: https://multiref.github.io/.

TL;DR: 论文提出了MMReID-Bench，首个针对多模态行人重识别的多任务基准，旨在利用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）解决传统行人ReID模型在多模态数据上的泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统行人重识别模型在多模态数据（如RGB、热成像、红外、草图等）上泛化能力差，而现有的多模态大语言模型方法未能充分发挥其推理和跨模态理解能力。

Method: 引入MMReID-Bench基准，包含20,710个多模态查询和库图像，覆盖10种行人重识别任务，全面评估MLLMs的能力。

Result: 实验表明MLLMs在多模态行人重识别中表现优异，但在处理热成像和红外数据时仍有局限。

Conclusion: MMReID-Bench有望推动开发更鲁棒、泛化能力更强的多模态基础模型。

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) aims to retrieve the images of an interested
person in the gallery images, with wide applications in medical rehabilitation,
abnormal behavior detection, and public security. However, traditional person
ReID models suffer from uni-modal capability, leading to poor generalization
ability in multi-modal data, such as RGB, thermal, infrared, sketch images,
textual descriptions, etc. Recently, the emergence of multi-modal large
language models (MLLMs) shows a promising avenue for addressing this problem.
Despite this potential, existing methods merely regard MLLMs as feature
extractors or caption generators, which do not fully unleash their reasoning,
instruction-following, and cross-modal understanding capabilities. To bridge
this gap, we introduce MMReID-Bench, the first multi-task multi-modal benchmark
specifically designed for person ReID. The MMReID-Bench includes 20,710
multi-modal queries and gallery images covering 10 different person ReID tasks.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable capabilities of MLLMs in
delivering effective and versatile person ReID. Nevertheless, they also have
limitations in handling a few modalities, particularly thermal and infrared
data. We hope MMReID-Bench can facilitate the community to develop more robust
and generalizable multimodal foundation models for person ReID.

Conclusion: Talk2Image通过多代理协作和多轮反馈机制，实现了用户意图的逐步对齐和一致的图像编辑。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation tasks have driven remarkable advances in diverse
media applications, yet most focus on single-turn scenarios and struggle with
iterative, multi-turn creative tasks. Recent dialogue-based systems attempt to
bridge this gap, but their single-agent, sequential paradigm often causes
intention drift and incoherent edits. To address these limitations, we present
Talk2Image, a novel multi-agent system for interactive image generation and
editing in multi-turn dialogue scenarios. Our approach integrates three key
components: intention parsing from dialogue history, task decomposition and
collaborative execution across specialized agents, and feedback-driven
refinement based on a multi-view evaluation mechanism. Talk2Image enables
step-by-step alignment with user intention and consistent image editing.
Experiments demonstrate that Talk2Image outperforms existing baselines in
controllability, coherence, and user satisfaction across iterative image
generation and editing tasks.

Abstract: Inspired by the success of reinforcement learning (RL) in refining large

training into autoregressive (AR) image generation models. We adapt the Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to refine the vanilla
autoregressive models' outputs by carefully designed reward functions that
evaluate generated images across multiple quality dimensions, including
perceptual quality, realism, and semantic fidelity. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on both class-conditional (i.e., class-to-image) and
text-conditional (i.e., text-to-image) image generation tasks, demonstrating
that our RL-enhanced framework significantly improves both the image quality
and human preference of generated images compared to the standard AR baselines.
Our results show consistent improvements across various evaluation metrics,
establishing the viability of RL-based optimization for AR image generation and
opening new avenues for controllable and high-quality image synthesis. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在区域图像编辑中难以平衡文本依从性、上下文保真度和编辑无缝性，因此需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: CannyEdit采用选择性Canny控制（保留未编辑区域的细节）和双提示引导（结合局部和全局提示），实现精确且连贯的编辑。

Result: 在真实图像编辑任务中，CannyEdit在文本依从性和上下文保真度的平衡上优于现有方法（提升2.93%至10.49%），且编辑结果更自然。

Conclusion: CannyEdit通过创新方法显著提升了区域图像编辑的质量和自然度，为文本到图像编辑提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models have enabled training-free
regional image editing by leveraging the generative priors of foundation
models. However, existing methods struggle to balance text adherence in edited
regions, context fidelity in unedited areas, and seamless integration of edits.
We introduce CannyEdit, a novel training-free framework that addresses these
challenges through two key innovations: (1) Selective Canny Control, which
masks the structural guidance of Canny ControlNet in user-specified editable
regions while strictly preserving details of the source images in unedited
areas via inversion-phase ControlNet information retention. This enables
precise, text-driven edits without compromising contextual integrity. (2)
Dual-Prompt Guidance, which combines local prompts for object-specific edits
with a global target prompt to maintain coherent scene interactions. On
real-world image editing tasks (addition, replacement, removal), CannyEdit
outperforms prior methods like KV-Edit, achieving a 2.93 to 10.49 percent
improvement in the balance of text adherence and context fidelity. In terms of
editing seamlessness, user studies reveal only 49.2 percent of general users
and 42.0 percent of AIGC experts identified CannyEdit's results as AI-edited
when paired with real images without edits, versus 76.08 to 89.09 percent for
competitor methods.

Abstract: Sign Language Production (SLP) is the task of generating sign language video
from spoken language inputs. The field has seen a range of innovations over the
last few years, with the introduction of deep learning-based approaches
providing significant improvements in the realism and naturalness of generated
outputs. However, the lack of standardized evaluation metrics for SLP
approaches hampers meaningful comparisons across different systems. To address
this, we introduce the first Sign Language Production Challenge, held as part
of the third SLRTP Workshop at CVPR 2025. The competition's aims are to
evaluate architectures that translate from spoken language sentences to a
sequence of skeleton poses, known as Text-to-Pose (T2P) translation, over a
range of metrics. For our evaluation data, we use the
RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T dataset, a German Sign Language - Deutsche
Gebardensprache (DGS) weather broadcast dataset. In addition, we curate a
custom hidden test set from a similar domain of discourse. This paper presents
the challenge design and the winning methodologies. The challenge attracted 33
participants who submitted 231 solutions, with the top-performing team
achieving BLEU-1 scores of 31.40 and DTW-MJE of 0.0574. The winning approach
utilized a retrieval-based framework and a pre-trained language model. As part
of the workshop, we release a standardized evaluation network, including
high-quality skeleton extraction-based keypoints establishing a consistent
baseline for the SLP field, which will enable future researchers to compare
their work against a broader range of methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 频率域方法基于固定基函数，缺乏对图像内容的适应性，无法动态调整特征提取。

Method: SCOPE包含两个模块：Subtle Detail Extractor（SDE）动态增强浅层细节，Salient Semantic Refiner（SSR）从高层特征中学习语义一致的细化特征。

Result: 在四个流行的细粒度图像分类基准测试中达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: SCOPE通过动态多尺度融合，显著提升了细粒度视觉分类的性能。

Abstract: The crux of resolving fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) lies in
capturing discriminative and class-specific cues that correspond to subtle
visual characteristics. Recently, frequency decomposition/transform based
approaches have attracted considerable interests since its appearing
discriminative cue mining ability. However, the frequency-domain methods are
based on fixed basis functions, lacking adaptability to image content and
unable to dynamically adjust feature extraction according to the discriminative
requirements of different images. To address this, we propose a novel method
for FGVC, named Subtle-Cue Oriented Perception Engine (SCOPE), which adaptively
enhances the representational capability of low-level details and high-level
semantics in the spatial domain, breaking through the limitations of fixed
scales in the frequency domain and improving the flexibility of multi-scale
fusion. The core of SCOPE lies in two modules: the Subtle Detail Extractor
(SDE), which dynamically enhances subtle details such as edges and textures
from shallow features, and the Salient Semantic Refiner (SSR), which learns
semantically coherent and structure-aware refinement features from the
high-level features guided by the enhanced shallow features. The SDE and SSR
are cascaded stage-by-stage to progressively combine local details with global
semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves new
state-of-the-art on four popular fine-grained image classification benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个针对文本到视频检索（T2VR）的攻击方法ViPro，旨在提升视频排名，并提出了Modal Refinement（MoRe）以增强黑盒迁移能力。实验表明ViPro在多种场景下显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2VR攻击主要关注降低视频排名，而提升视频排名的攻击未被充分研究，这种攻击可能带来更大的经济利益和传播（错误）信息的影响。

Method: 提出ViPro攻击方法，通过Modal Refinement（MoRe）捕捉视觉与文本模态的细粒度交互，增强黑盒迁移能力。

Result: ViPro在白盒、灰盒和黑盒设置下平均分别超过基线方法30%、10%和4%。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了T2VR的潜在漏洞，分析了攻击的上下界，并提供了对抗措施的见解。

Abstract: Thanks to the development of cross-modal models, text-to-video retrieval
(T2VR) is advancing rapidly, but its robustness remains largely unexamined.
Existing attacks against T2VR are designed to push videos away from queries,
i.e., suppressing the ranks of videos, while the attacks that pull videos
towards selected queries, i.e., promoting the ranks of videos, remain largely
unexplored. These attacks can be more impactful as attackers may gain more
views/clicks for financial benefits and widespread (mis)information. To this
end, we pioneer the first attack against T2VR to promote videos adversarially,
dubbed the Video Promotion attack (ViPro). We further propose Modal Refinement
(MoRe) to capture the finer-grained, intricate interaction between visual and
textual modalities to enhance black-box transferability. Comprehensive
experiments cover 2 existing baselines, 3 leading T2VR models, 3 prevailing
datasets with over 10k videos, evaluated under 3 scenarios. All experiments are
conducted in a multi-target setting to reflect realistic scenarios where
attackers seek to promote the video regarding multiple queries simultaneously.
We also evaluated our attacks for defences and imperceptibility. Overall, ViPro
surpasses other baselines by over $30/10/4\%$ for white/grey/black-box settings
on average. Our work highlights an overlooked vulnerability, provides a
qualitative analysis on the upper/lower bound of our attacks, and offers
insights into potential counterplays. Code will be publicly available at

### [58] [Evaluating Fisheye-Compatible 3D Gaussian Splatting Methods on Real Images Beyond 180 Degree Field of View](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06968)
*Ulas Gunes,Matias Turkulainen,Juho Kannala,Esa Rahtu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 首次评估了Fisheye-GS和3DGUT这两种基于鱼眼镜头的3D高斯泼溅方法在真实图像上的表现，覆盖了超过180度的视场。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究鱼眼镜头在极端畸变下的3D重建效果，并提出一种基于深度的初始化策略以解决传统SfM方法的局限性。

Method: 在室内外场景中使用200度鱼眼镜头拍摄，评估不同视场（200度、160度、120度）下的性能，并采用UniK3D预测的深度信息进行初始化。

Result: Fisheye-GS在160度视场下表现最佳，而3DGUT在所有视场下均稳定且保持高质量。UniK3D虽未针对鱼眼数据训练，但仍能生成密集点云，效果与SfM相当。

Conclusion: 鱼眼镜头结合3D高斯泼溅方法在宽角度3D重建中具有实际可行性，尤其适用于稀疏且畸变严重的图像输入。

Abstract: We present the first evaluation of fisheye-based 3D Gaussian Splatting
methods, Fisheye-GS and 3DGUT, on real images with fields of view exceeding 180
degree. Our study covers both indoor and outdoor scenes captured with 200
degree fisheye cameras and analyzes how each method handles extreme distortion
in real world settings. We evaluate performance under varying fields of view
(200 degree, 160 degree, and 120 degree) to study the tradeoff between
peripheral distortion and spatial coverage. Fisheye-GS benefits from field of
view (FoV) reduction, particularly at 160 degree, while 3DGUT remains stable
across all settings and maintains high perceptual quality at the full 200
degree view. To address the limitations of SfM-based initialization, which
often fails under strong distortion, we also propose a depth-based strategy
using UniK3D predictions from only 2-3 fisheye images per scene. Although
UniK3D is not trained on real fisheye data, it produces dense point clouds that
enable reconstruction quality on par with SfM, even in difficult scenes with
fog, glare, or sky. Our results highlight the practical viability of
fisheye-based 3DGS methods for wide-angle 3D reconstruction from sparse and
distortion-heavy image inputs.

TL;DR: WeatherDiffusion是一个基于扩散模型的框架，用于自动驾驶场景中的正向和逆向渲染，支持天气和光照编辑，并通过提出的MAA机制提升渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂天气和光照条件对自动驾驶场景的理解和重建提出了挑战，现有扩散模型难以控制且缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 提出WeatherDiffusion框架，结合文本引导的预测本征图和MAA机制，实现高质量渲染；并构建了合成和真实数据集。

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，并在下游任务（如目标检测和图像分割）中表现出显著价值。

Conclusion: WeatherDiffusion为自动驾驶场景的渲染和编辑提供了高效且可控的解决方案，提升了复杂天气条件下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Forward and inverse rendering have emerged as key techniques for enabling
understanding and reconstruction in the context of autonomous driving (AD).
However, complex weather and illumination pose great challenges to this task.
The emergence of large diffusion models has shown promise in achieving
reasonable results through learning from 2D priors, but these models are
difficult to control and lack robustness. In this paper, we introduce
WeatherDiffusion, a diffusion-based framework for forward and inverse rendering
on AD scenes with various weather and lighting conditions. Our method enables
authentic estimation of material properties, scene geometry, and lighting, and
further supports controllable weather and illumination editing through the use
of predicted intrinsic maps guided by text descriptions. We observe that
different intrinsic maps should correspond to different regions of the original
image. Based on this observation, we propose Intrinsic map-aware attention
(MAA) to enable high-quality inverse rendering. Additionally, we introduce a
synthetic dataset (\ie WeatherSynthetic) and a real-world dataset (\ie
WeatherReal) for forward and inverse rendering on AD scenes with diverse
weather and lighting. Extensive experiments show that our WeatherDiffusion
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks. Moreover, our
method demonstrates significant value in downstream tasks for AD, enhancing the
robustness of object detection and image segmentation in challenging weather
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对复杂结构和高度变形的文档图像去扭曲效果不佳，作者认为去扭曲是一个渐进过程而非一步变换。

Method: 将任务重新建模为动态过程，提出轻量级框架TADoc，并引入新评价指标DLS。

Result: 实验表明TADoc在多种文档类型和变形程度下表现优越，具有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 动态建模和新评价指标DLS有效提升了文档图像去扭曲的效果和评估全面性。

Abstract: Flattening curved, wrinkled, and rotated document images captured by portable
photographing devices, termed document image dewarping, has become an
increasingly important task with the rise of digital economy and online
working. Although many methods have been proposed recently, they often struggle
to achieve satisfactory results when confronted with intricate document
structures and higher degrees of deformation in real-world scenarios. Our main
insight is that, unlike other document restoration tasks (e.g., deblurring),
dewarping in real physical scenes is a progressive motion rather than a
one-step transformation. Based on this, we have undertaken two key initiatives.
Firstly, we reformulate this task, modeling it for the first time as a dynamic
process that encompasses a series of intermediate states. Secondly, we design a
lightweight framework called TADoc (Time-Aware Document Dewarping Network) to
address the geometric distortion of document images. In addition, due to the
inadequacy of OCR metrics for document images containing sparse text, the
comprehensiveness of evaluation is insufficient. To address this shortcoming,
we propose a new metric -- DLS (Document Layout Similarity) -- to evaluate the
effectiveness of document dewarping in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments
and in-depth evaluations have been conducted and the results indicate that our
model possesses strong robustness, achieving superiority on several benchmarks
with different document types and degrees of distortion.

*Nick Lemke,John Kalkhof,Niklas Babendererde,Anirban Mukhopadhyay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OctreeNCA是一种基于八叉树数据结构的改进型神经细胞自动机（NCA），用于高效分割高分辨率医学图像和视频，显著降低VRAM消耗并提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割（如前列腺MRI、病理切片或手术视频）需要全局上下文，但传统方法（如UNet或Vision Transformers）因VRAM限制而无法一次性处理大输入，导致全局一致性和推理速度下降。

Method: 通过八叉树数据结构扩展NCA的邻域定义，实现全局知识的高效传递，并开发了基于CUDA的NCA推理函数以优化VRAM使用和推理速度。

Result: OctreeNCA在高分辨率图像和视频分割中占用比UNet少90%的VRAM，并能一次性处理184兆像素的病理切片或1分钟的手术视频。

Conclusion: OctreeNCA在保持分割质量的同时，显著提升了处理大输入的能力和效率，适用于医学图像分割任务。

Abstract: Medical applications demand segmentation of large inputs, like prostate MRIs,
pathology slices, or videos of surgery. These inputs should ideally be inferred
at once to provide the model with proper spatial or temporal context. When
segmenting large inputs, the VRAM consumption of the GPU becomes the
bottleneck. Architectures like UNets or Vision Transformers scale very poorly
in VRAM consumption, resulting in patch- or frame-wise approaches that
compromise global consistency and inference speed. The lightweight Neural
Cellular Automaton (NCA) is a bio-inspired model that is by construction
size-invariant. However, due to its local-only communication rules, it lacks
global knowledge. We propose OctreeNCA by generalizing the neighborhood
definition using an octree data structure. Our generalized neighborhood
definition enables the efficient traversal of global knowledge. Since deep
learning frameworks are mainly developed for large multi-layer networks, their
implementation does not fully leverage the advantages of NCAs. We implement an
NCA inference function in CUDA that further reduces VRAM demands and increases
inference speed. Our OctreeNCA segments high-resolution images and videos
quickly while occupying 90% less VRAM than a UNet during evaluation. This
allows us to segment 184 Megapixel pathology slices or 1-minute surgical videos
at once.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自监督图像分割模型在多阶段预训练中需要耗时的伪掩码生成过程，导致难以扩展且优化不连续。

Method: 提出了快速并行伪掩码算法UniAP，并基于此设计了S2-UniSeg模型，采用QuerySD任务进行预训练。

Result: S2-UniSeg在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法，如COCO上AP提升6.9。

Conclusion: UniAP和S2-UniSeg解决了现有方法的效率与性能问题，展示了在大规模数据上的潜力。

Abstract: Recent self-supervised image segmentation models have achieved promising
performance on semantic segmentation and class-agnostic instance segmentation.
However, their pretraining schedule is multi-stage, requiring a time-consuming
pseudo-masks generation process between each training epoch. This
time-consuming offline process not only makes it difficult to scale with
training dataset size, but also leads to sub-optimal solutions due to its
discontinuous optimization routine. To solve these, we first present a novel
pseudo-mask algorithm, Fast Universal Agglomerative Pooling (UniAP). Each layer
of UniAP can identify groups of similar nodes in parallel, allowing to generate
both semantic-level and instance-level and multi-granular pseudo-masks within
ens of milliseconds for one image. Based on the fast UniAP, we propose the
Scalable Self-Supervised Universal Segmentation (S2-UniSeg), which employs a
student and a momentum teacher for continuous pretraining. A novel
segmentation-oriented pretext task, Query-wise Self-Distillation (QuerySD), is
proposed to pretrain S2-UniSeg to learn the local-to-global correspondences.
Under the same setting, S2-UniSeg outperforms the SOTA UnSAM model, achieving
notable improvements of AP+6.9 on COCO, AR+11.1 on UVO, PixelAcc+4.5 on
COCOStuff-27, RQ+8.0 on Cityscapes. After scaling up to a larger 2M-image
subset of SA-1B, S2-UniSeg further achieves performance gains on all four
benchmarks. Our code and pretrained models are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率文本到图像生成模型的兴起为SVBRDF生成提供了机会，但如何高效生成多图对齐的SVBRDF仍具挑战性。

Method: 引入HiMat框架和CrossStitch模块，通过轻量级卷积操作捕获图间依赖关系，保持DiT主干不变。

Result: 实验表明HiMat能生成结构一致且高频细节丰富的4K SVBRDF，并可推广至本征分解等任务。

Conclusion: HiMat为高效生成高质量SVBRDF提供了一种轻量级解决方案。

Abstract: Creating highly detailed SVBRDFs is essential for 3D content creation. The
rise of high-resolution text-to-image generative models, based on diffusion
transformers (DiT), suggests an opportunity to finetune them for this task.
However, retargeting the models to produce multiple aligned SVBRDF maps instead
of just RGB images, while achieving high efficiency and ensuring consistency
across different maps, remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce HiMat:
a memory- and computation-efficient diffusion-based framework capable of
generating native 4K-resolution SVBRDFs. A key challenge we address is
maintaining consistency across different maps in a lightweight manner, without
relying on training new VAEs or significantly altering the DiT backbone (which
would damage its prior capabilities). To tackle this, we introduce the
CrossStitch module, a lightweight convolutional module that captures inter-map
dependencies through localized operations. Its weights are initialized such
that the DiT backbone operation is unchanged before finetuning starts. HiMat
enables generation with strong structural coherence and high-frequency details.
Results with a large set of text prompts demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach for 4K SVBRDF generation. Further experiments suggest generalization
to tasks such as intrinsic decomposition.

Motivation: 高光谱卫星图像具有数百个连续光谱波段，但现有自监督方法难以有效利用其复杂的空间-光谱相关性。

Method: 提出TerraMAE框架，包括基于统计反射特性的自适应通道分组策略和结合空间-光谱质量指标的增强重建损失函数。

Result: TerraMAE在高保真图像重建中表现出卓越的空间-光谱信息保留能力，并在作物识别、土地覆盖分类和土壤纹理预测任务中取得优异性能。

Conclusion: TerraMAE为高光谱图像分析提供了一种高效的自监督学习解决方案，具有广泛的地理空间应用潜力。

Abstract: Hyperspectral satellite imagery offers sub-30 m views of Earth in hundreds of
contiguous spectral bands, enabling fine-grained mapping of soils, crops, and
land cover. While self-supervised Masked Autoencoders excel on RGB and low-band
multispectral data, they struggle to exploit the intricate spatial-spectral
correlations in 200+ band hyperspectral images. We introduce TerraMAE, a novel
HSI encoding framework specifically designed to learn highly representative
spatial-spectral embeddings for diverse geospatial analyses. TerraMAE features
an adaptive channel grouping strategy, based on statistical reflectance
properties to capture spectral similarities, and an enhanced reconstruction
loss function that incorporates spatial and spectral quality metrics. We
demonstrate TerraMAE's effectiveness through superior spatial-spectral
information preservation in high-fidelity image reconstruction. Furthermore, we
validate its practical utility and the quality of its learned representations
through strong performance on three key downstream geospatial tasks: crop
identification, land cover classification, and soil texture prediction.

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific literature in PDF format necessitates
advanced tools for efficient and accurate document understanding,
summarization, and content optimization. Traditional methods fall short in
handling complex layouts and multimodal content, while direct application of
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) lacks
precision and control for intricate editing tasks. This paper introduces
DocRefine, an innovative framework designed for intelligent understanding,
content refinement, and automated summarization of scientific PDF documents,
driven by natural language instructions. DocRefine leverages the power of
advanced LVLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) by orchestrating a sophisticated multi-agent
system comprising six specialized and collaborative agents: Layout & Structure
Analysis, Multimodal Content Understanding, Instruction Decomposition, Content
Refinement, Summarization & Generation, and Fidelity & Consistency
Verification. This closed-loop feedback architecture ensures high semantic
accuracy and visual fidelity. Evaluated on the comprehensive DocEditBench
dataset, DocRefine consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across
various tasks, achieving overall scores of 86.7% for Semantic Consistency Score
(SCS), 93.9% for Layout Fidelity Index (LFI), and 85.0% for Instruction

in handling complex multimodal document editing, preserving semantic integrity,

Abstract: Complex Visual Question Answering (Complex VQA) tasks, which demand
sophisticated multi-modal reasoning and external knowledge integration, present
significant challenges for existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) often
limited by their reliance on high-level global features. To address this, we
propose MV-CoRe (Multimodal Visual-Conceptual Reasoning), a novel model
designed to enhance Complex VQA performance through the deep fusion of diverse
visual and linguistic information. MV-CoRe meticulously integrates global
embeddings from pre-trained Vision Large Models (VLMs) and Language Large
Models (LLMs) with fine-grained semantic-aware visual features, including
object detection characteristics and scene graph representations. An innovative
Multimodal Fusion Transformer then processes and deeply integrates these
diverse feature sets, enabling rich cross-modal attention and facilitating
complex reasoning. We evaluate MV-CoRe on challenging Complex VQA benchmarks,
including GQA, A-OKVQA, and OKVQA, after training on VQAv2. Our experimental
results demonstrate that MV-CoRe consistently outperforms established LVLM
baselines, achieving an overall accuracy of 77.5% on GQA. Ablation studies
confirm the critical contribution of both object and scene graph features, and
human evaluations further validate MV-CoRe's superior factual correctness and

Conclusion: FOCUS-Med展示了AI辅助结肠镜检查的临床潜力。

Abstract: Accurate endoscopic image segmentation on the polyps is critical for early
colorectal cancer detection. However, this task remains challenging due to low
contrast with surrounding mucosa, specular highlights, and indistinct
boundaries. To address these challenges, we propose FOCUS-Med, which stands for
Fusion of spatial and structural graph with attentional context-aware polyp
segmentation in endoscopic medical imaging. FOCUS-Med integrates a Dual Graph
Convolutional Network (Dual-GCN) module to capture contextual spatial and
topological structural dependencies. This graph-based representation enables
the model to better distinguish polyps from background tissues by leveraging
topological cues and spatial connectivity, which are often obscured in raw
image intensities. It enhances the model's ability to preserve boundaries and
delineate complex shapes typical of polyps. In addition, a location-fused
stand-alone self-attention is employed to strengthen global context
integration. To bridge the semantic gap between encoder-decoder layers, we
incorporate a trainable weighted fast normalized fusion strategy for efficient
multi-scale aggregation. Notably, we are the first to introduce the use of a
Large Language Model (LLM) to provide detailed qualitative evaluations of
segmentation quality. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate
that FOCUS-Med achieves state-of-the-art performance across five key metrics,
underscoring its effectiveness and clinical potential for AI-assisted
colonoscopy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Textured Surfel Octree（TeSO）的新型3D表示方法，通过结合八叉树结构和纹理贴图，解决了现有3D表示在渲染质量、表面定义和压缩性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D表示（如点云、网格和3D高斯）在渲染质量、表面定义和压缩性方面存在不足，需要一种更高效的3D表示方法。

Method: TeSO将3D场景表示为八叉树组织的立方体边界曲面元素（surfel），每个surfel关联一个纹理贴图，并通过压缩方案高效编码几何和纹理。

Result: 与现有方法相比，TeSO在更低比特率下实现了更高的渲染质量。

Conclusion: TeSO是一种高效且高质量的3D表示方法，适用于3D流媒体和AR/VR应用。

Abstract: 3D visual content streaming is a key technology for emerging 3D telepresence
and AR/VR applications. One fundamental element underlying the technology is a
versatile 3D representation that is capable of producing high-quality renders
and can be efficiently compressed at the same time. Existing 3D representations
like point clouds, meshes and 3D Gaussians each have limitations in terms of
rendering quality, surface definition, and compressibility. In this paper, we
present the Textured Surfel Octree (TeSO), a novel 3D representation that is
built from point clouds but addresses the aforementioned limitations. It
represents a 3D scene as cube-bounded surfels organized on an octree, where
each surfel is further associated with a texture patch. By approximating a
smooth surface with a large surfel at a coarser level of the octree, it reduces
the number of primitives required to represent the 3D scene, and yet retains
the high-frequency texture details through the texture map attached to each
surfel. We further propose a compression scheme to encode the geometry and
texture efficiently, leveraging the octree structure. The proposed textured
surfel octree combined with the compression scheme achieves higher rendering
quality at lower bit-rates compared to multiple point cloud and 3D
Gaussian-based baselines.

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，EPA达到54.9%，优于之前方法9.3%，并在mAP和minADE上表现最佳。

Conclusion: ForeSight通过联合优化检测与预测，实现了无需显式目标关联的高效3D感知，性能显著提升。

Abstract: We introduce ForeSight, a novel joint detection and forecasting framework for
vision-based 3D perception in autonomous vehicles. Traditional approaches treat
detection and forecasting as separate sequential tasks, limiting their ability
to leverage temporal cues. ForeSight addresses this limitation with a
multi-task streaming and bidirectional learning approach, allowing detection
and forecasting to share query memory and propagate information seamlessly. The
forecast-aware detection transformer enhances spatial reasoning by integrating
trajectory predictions from a multiple hypothesis forecast memory queue, while
the streaming forecast transformer improves temporal consistency using past
forecasts and refined detections. Unlike tracking-based methods, ForeSight
eliminates the need for explicit object association, reducing error propagation
with a tracking-free model that efficiently scales across multi-frame
sequences. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that ForeSight achieves
state-of-the-art performance, achieving an EPA of 54.9%, surpassing previous
methods by 9.3%, while also attaining the best mAP and minADE among multi-view
detection and forecasting models.

Abstract: Collaborative 3D detection can substantially boost detection performance by
allowing agents to exchange complementary information. It inherently results in
a fundamental trade-off between detection performance and communication
bandwidth. To tackle this bottleneck issue, we propose a novel hybrid
collaboration that adaptively integrates two types of communication messages:
perceptual outputs, which are compact, and raw observations, which offer richer
information. This approach focuses on two key aspects: i) integrating
complementary information from two message types and ii) prioritizing the most
critical data within each type. By adaptively selecting the most critical set
of messages, it ensures optimal perceptual information and adaptability,
effectively meeting the demands of diverse communication scenarios.Building on
this hybrid collaboration, we present \texttt{HyComm}, a
communication-efficient LiDAR-based collaborative 3D detection system.
\texttt{HyComm} boasts two main benefits: i) it facilitates adaptable
compression rates for messages, addressing various communication requirements,
and ii) it uses standardized data formats for messages. This ensures they are
independent of specific detection models, fostering adaptability across
different agent configurations. To evaluate HyComm, we conduct experiments on
both real-world and simulation datasets: DAIR-V2X and OPV2V. HyComm
consistently outperforms previous methods and achieves a superior
performance-bandwidth trade-off regardless of whether agents use the same or
varied detection models. It achieves a lower communication volume of more than
2,006$\times$ and still outperforms Where2comm on DAIR-V2X in terms of AP50.
The related code will be released.

TL;DR: AugLift通过增强2D关键点输入（加入置信度和深度估计），显著提升了3D人体姿态估计的泛化性能，无需额外数据或传感器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于提升的3D姿态估计方法在新数据集和实际场景中泛化能力较差。

Method: AugLift在标准2D关键点坐标基础上，稀疏地加入关键点检测置信度和深度估计，利用预训练模型计算这些信号。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验显示，AugLift在未见数据集上平均提升10.1%性能，在分布内数据上提升4.0%。

Conclusion: AugLift通过提供稀疏的关键点对齐线索，显著提升了任何基于提升的姿态估计模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Lifting-based methods for 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE), which predict 3D
poses from detected 2D keypoints, often generalize poorly to new datasets and
real-world settings. To address this, we propose \emph{AugLift}, a simple yet
effective reformulation of the standard lifting pipeline that significantly
improves generalization performance without requiring additional data
collection or sensors. AugLift sparsely enriches the standard input -- the 2D
keypoint coordinates $(x, y)$ -- by augmenting it with a keypoint detection
confidence score $c$ and a corresponding depth estimate $d$. These additional
signals are computed from the image using off-the-shelf, pre-trained models
(e.g., for monocular depth estimation), thereby inheriting their strong
generalization capabilities. Importantly, AugLift serves as a modular add-on
and can be readily integrated into existing lifting architectures.
  Our extensive experiments across four datasets demonstrate that AugLift
boosts cross-dataset performance on unseen datasets by an average of $10.1\%$,
while also improving in-distribution performance by $4.0\%$. These gains are
consistent across various lifting architectures, highlighting the robustness of
our method. Our analysis suggests that these sparse, keypoint-aligned cues
provide robust frame-level context, offering a practical way to significantly
improve the generalization of any lifting-based pose estimation model. Code
will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 生成模型在医学影像中潜力巨大，但合成图像的质量和临床实用性仍需验证。本研究评估了GAN和DM在合成胸部X光片中的表现，发现DM整体更真实，而GAN在某些条件下更准确。


<details>

Motivation: 解决医学影像数据稀缺问题，尤其是低发病率异常，同时验证合成图像的临床实用性。

Method: 使用GAN和DM合成胸部X光片，基于MIMIC-CXR数据集进行读者研究，由三位放射科医生评估真实与合成图像的区分及一致性。

Result: DM生成图像整体更真实，但GAN在特定条件下（如ECS缺失）更准确。研究还揭示了放射科医生识别合成图像的视觉线索。

Conclusion: GAN和DM各有优势，需进一步优化以确保生成模型能可靠地用于AI诊断系统的训练数据增强。

Abstract: Generative image models have achieved remarkable progress in both natural and
medical imaging. In the medical context, these techniques offer a potential
solution to data scarcity-especially for low-prevalence anomalies that impair
the performance of AI-driven diagnostic and segmentation tools. However,
questions remain regarding the fidelity and clinical utility of synthetic
images, since poor generation quality can undermine model generalizability and
trust. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art
generative models-Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models
(DMs)-for synthesizing chest X-rays conditioned on four abnormalities:
Atelectasis (AT), Lung Opacity (LO), Pleural Effusion (PE), and Enlarged
Cardiac Silhouette (ECS). Using a benchmark composed of real images from the
MIMIC-CXR dataset and synthetic images from both GANs and DMs, we conducted a
reader study with three radiologists of varied experience. Participants were
asked to distinguish real from synthetic images and assess the consistency
between visual features and the target abnormality. Our results show that while
DMs generate more visually realistic images overall, GANs can report better
accuracy for specific conditions, such as absence of ECS. We further identify
visual cues radiologists use to detect synthetic images, offering insights into
the perceptual gaps in current models. These findings underscore the
complementary strengths of GANs and DMs and point to the need for further
refinement to ensure generative models can reliably augment training datasets
for AI diagnostic systems.

Conclusion: CMAMRNet为壁画修复提供了一种高效且保持艺术真实性的解决方案。

Abstract: Murals, as invaluable cultural artifacts, face continuous deterioration from
environmental factors and human activities. Digital restoration of murals faces
unique challenges due to their complex degradation patterns and the critical
need to preserve artistic authenticity. Existing learning-based methods
struggle with maintaining consistent mask guidance throughout their networks,
leading to insufficient focus on damaged regions and compromised restoration
quality. We propose CMAMRNet, a Contextual Mask-Aware Mural Restoration Network
that addresses these limitations through comprehensive mask guidance and
multi-scale feature extraction. Our framework introduces two key components:
(1) the Mask-Aware Up/Down-Sampler (MAUDS), which ensures consistent mask
sensitivity across resolution scales through dedicated channel-wise feature
selection and mask-guided feature fusion; and (2) the Co-Feature Aggregator
(CFA), operating at both the highest and lowest resolutions to extract
complementary features for capturing fine textures and global structures in
degraded regions. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
CMAMRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, effectively preserving both
structural integrity and artistic details in restored murals. The code is

Motivation: 解决大型HVM依赖大规模预训练数据和复杂架构的问题，提升轻量级HVM在实际应用中的实用性。

Method: 设计动态模式解码器（D-PaDe）和三级对齐目标，分别从全局、局部和实例关系层面对齐轻量级与大型HVM。

Result: 在15个数据集上验证了DPAL的有效性，轻量级模型（5M参数）性能接近大型HVM（84M/307M），并显著优于其他蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: DPAL通过动态模式对齐学习，显著提升了轻量级HVM的泛化能力，适用于多种人本视觉任务。

Abstract: Human-centric vision models (HVMs) have achieved remarkable generalization
due to large-scale pretraining on massive person images. However, their
dependence on large neural architectures and the restricted accessibility of
pretraining data significantly limits their practicality in real-world
applications. To address this limitation, we propose Dynamic Pattern Alignment
Learning (DPAL), a novel distillation-based pretraining framework that
efficiently trains lightweight HVMs to acquire strong generalization from large
HVMs. In particular, human-centric visual perception are highly dependent on
three typical visual patterns, including global identity pattern, local shape
pattern and multi-person interaction pattern. To achieve generalizable
lightweight HVMs, we firstly design a dynamic pattern decoder (D-PaDe), acting
as a dynamic Mixture of Expert (MoE) model. It incorporates three specialized
experts dedicated to adaptively extract typical visual patterns, conditioned on
both input image and pattern queries. And then, we present three levels of
alignment objectives, which aims to minimize generalization gap between
lightweight HVMs and large HVMs at global image level, local pixel level, and
instance relation level. With these two deliberate designs, the DPAL
effectively guides lightweight model to learn all typical human visual patterns
from large HVMs, which can generalize to various human-centric vision tasks.
Extensive experiments conducted on 15 challenging datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the DPAL. Remarkably, when employing PATH-B as the teacher,
DPAL-ViT/Ti (5M parameters) achieves surprising generalizability similar to
existing large HVMs such as PATH-B (84M) and Sapiens-L (307M), and outperforms
previous distillation-based pretraining methods including Proteus-ViT/Ti (5M)
and TinyMiM-ViT/Ti (5M) by a large margin.

Abstract: Predicting pedestrian motion trajectories is critical for the path planning
and motion control of autonomous vehicles. Recent diffusion-based models have
shown promising results in capturing the inherent stochasticity of pedestrian
behavior for trajectory prediction. However, the absence of explicit semantic
modelling of pedestrian intent in many diffusion-based methods may result in
misinterpreted behaviors and reduced prediction accuracy. To address the above
challenges, we propose a diffusion-based pedestrian trajectory prediction
framework that incorporates both short-term and long-term motion intentions.
Short-term intent is modelled using a residual polar representation, which
decouples direction and magnitude to capture fine-grained local motion
patterns. Long-term intent is estimated through a learnable, token-based
endpoint predictor that generates multiple candidate goals with associated
probabilities, enabling multimodal and context-aware intention modelling.
Furthermore, we enhance the diffusion process by incorporating adaptive
guidance and a residual noise predictor that dynamically refines denoising
accuracy. The proposed framework is evaluated on the widely used ETH, UCY, and
SDD benchmarks, demonstrating competitive results against state-of-the-art
methods.

Motivation: 草图动画通常需要专业技能且耗时，业余用户难以完成。本文旨在简化这一过程，使非专业人士也能轻松为草图添加动态效果。

Method: 分为三个阶段：1）外观学习，利用LoRA整合草图外观信息；2）运动学习，从参考视频中提取动态信息；3）视频先验蒸馏，使用SDS更新贝塞尔曲线参数以生成动态草图视频。

Result: 模型生成的草图视频既保留了原始外观，又复现了参考视频的动态效果，且在一键运动定制任务中表现优于其他方法。

Conclusion: SketchAnimator为草图动画提供了一种高效且用户友好的解决方案，降低了专业门槛。

Abstract: Sketching is a uniquely human tool for expressing ideas and creativity. The
animation of sketches infuses life into these static drawings, opening a new
dimension for designers. Animating sketches is a time-consuming process that
demands professional skills and extensive experience, often proving daunting
for amateurs. In this paper, we propose a novel sketch animation model
SketchAnimator, which enables adding creative motion to a given sketch, like "a
jumping car''. Namely, given an input sketch and a reference video, we divide
the sketch animation into three stages: Appearance Learning, Motion Learning
and Video Prior Distillation. In stages 1 and 2, we utilize LoRA to integrate
sketch appearance information and motion dynamics from the reference video into
the pre-trained T2V model. In the third stage, we utilize Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS) to update the parameters of the Bezier curves in each sketch
frame according to the acquired motion information. Consequently, our model
produces a sketch video that not only retains the original appearance of the
sketch but also mirrors the dynamic movements of the reference video. We
compare our method with alternative approaches and demonstrate that it
generates the desired sketch video under the challenge of one-shot motion
customization.

Conclusion: CoopDiff通过解耦建模和一致性约束，显著提升了人-物交互预测的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: 3D human-object interaction (HOI) anticipation aims to predict the future
motion of humans and their manipulated objects, conditioned on the historical
context. Generally, the articulated humans and rigid objects exhibit different
motion patterns, due to their distinct intrinsic physical properties. However,
this distinction is ignored by most of the existing works, which intend to
capture the dynamics of both humans and objects within a single prediction
model. In this work, we propose a novel contact-consistent decoupled diffusion
framework CoopDiff, which employs two distinct branches to decouple human and
object motion modeling, with the human-object contact points as shared anchors
to bridge the motion generation across branches. The human dynamics branch is
aimed to predict highly structured human motion, while the object dynamics
branch focuses on the object motion with rigid translations and rotations.
These two branches are bridged by a series of shared contact points with
consistency constraint for coherent human-object motion prediction. To further
enhance human-object consistency and prediction reliability, we propose a
human-driven interaction module to guide object motion modeling. Extensive
experiments on the BEHAVE and Human-object Interaction datasets demonstrate
that our CoopDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: In the domain of computer vision, multi-scale feature extraction is vital for
tasks such as salient object detection. However, achieving this capability in
lightweight networks remains challenging due to the trade-off between
efficiency and performance. This paper proposes a novel lightweight multi-scale
feature extraction layer, termed the LMF layer, which employs depthwise
separable dilated convolutions in a fully connected structure. By integrating
multiple LMF layers, we develop LMFNet, a lightweight network tailored for
salient object detection. Our approach significantly reduces the number of
parameters while maintaining competitive performance. Here, we show that LMFNet
achieves state-of-the-art or comparable results on five benchmark datasets with
only 0.81M parameters, outperforming several traditional and lightweight models
in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. Our work not only addresses the
challenge of multi-scale learning in lightweight networks but also demonstrates
the potential for broader applications in image processing tasks. The related

<details>

Motivation: 当前RVOS方法忽视表达式的语义结构，而视频引用表达式比图像更复杂，包含事件属性和时序关系，传统方法难以处理。

Method: EventRR分为对象总结和引用推理两部分：总结阶段生成瓶颈令牌并聚合全局跨模态时序上下文；推理阶段构建REG图并通过TCRR逐步累积引用分数。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，EventRR定量和定性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EventRR通过结构化语义和时序推理，显著提升了RVOS任务的性能。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment out the object in
a video referred by an expression. Current RVOS methods view referring
expressions as unstructured sequences, neglecting their crucial semantic
structure essential for referent reasoning. Besides, in contrast to
image-referring expressions whose semantics focus only on object attributes and
object-object relations, video-referring expressions also encompass event
attributes and event-event temporal relations. This complexity challenges
traditional structured reasoning image approaches. In this paper, we propose
the Event Referential Reasoning (EventRR) framework. EventRR decouples RVOS
into object summarization part and referent reasoning part. The summarization
phase begins by summarizing each frame into a set of bottleneck tokens, which
are then efficiently aggregated in the video-level summarization step to
exchange the global cross-modal temporal context. For reasoning part, EventRR
extracts semantic eventful structure of a video-referring expression into
highly expressive Referential Event Graph (REG), which is a single-rooted
directed acyclic graph. Guided by topological traversal of REG, we propose
Temporal Concept-Role Reasoning (TCRR) to accumulate the referring score of
each temporal query from REG leaf nodes to root node. Each reasoning step can
be interpreted as a question-answer pair derived from the concept-role
relations in REG. Extensive experiments across four widely recognized benchmark
datasets, show that EventRR quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms
state-of-the-art RVOS methods. Code is available at

Conclusion: DGN通过深度引导显著提升了图像修复质量，展示了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Image restoration has seen substantial progress in recent years. However,
existing methods often neglect depth information, which hurts similarity
matching, results in attention distractions in shallow depth-of-field (DoF)
scenarios, and excessive enhancement of background content in deep DoF
settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Depth-Guided
Network (DGN) for image restoration, together with a novel large-scale
high-resolution dataset. Specifically, the network consists of two interactive
branches: a depth estimation branch that provides structural guidance, and an
image restoration branch that performs the core restoration task. In addition,
the image restoration branch exploits intra-object similarity through
progressive window-based self-attention and captures inter-object similarity
via sparse non-local attention. Through joint training, depth features
contribute to improved restoration quality, while the enhanced visual features
from the restoration branch in turn help refine depth estimation. Notably, we
also introduce a new dataset for training and evaluation, consisting of 9,205
high-resolution images from 403 plant species, with diverse depth and texture
variations. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on several standard benchmarks and generalizes
well to unseen plant images, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.

Abstract: Unsupervised real-world super-resolution (SR) faces critical challenges due
to the complex, unknown degradation distributions in practical scenarios.
Existing methods struggle to generalize from synthetic low-resolution (LR) and
high-resolution (HR) image pairs to real-world data due to a significant domain
gap. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised real-world SR method based on
rectified flow to effectively capture and model real-world degradation,
synthesizing LR-HR training pairs with realistic degradation. Specifically,
given unpaired LR and HR images, we propose a novel Rectified Flow Degradation
Module (RFDM) that introduces degradation-transformed LR (DT-LR) images as
intermediaries. By modeling the degradation trajectory in a continuous and
invertible manner, RFDM better captures real-world degradation and enhances the
realism of generated LR images. Additionally, we propose a Fourier Prior Guided
Degradation Module (FGDM) that leverages structural information embedded in
Fourier phase components to ensure more precise modeling of real-world
degradation. Finally, the LR images are processed by both FGDM and RFDM,
producing final synthetic LR images with real-world degradation. The synthetic
LR images are paired with the given HR images to train the off-the-shelf SR
networks. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances the performance of existing SR approaches in
real-world scenarios.

Result: 实验表明，CMB-Net在图像篡改定位任务中优于现有大多数模型。

Conclusion: CMB-Net通过结合语义和视觉信息，有效提升了篡改定位的准确性，同时解决了LLMs幻觉导致的文本错误问题。

Abstract: The existing image manipulation localization (IML) models mainly relies on
visual cues, but ignores the semantic logical relationships between content
features. In fact, the content semantics conveyed by real images often conform
to human cognitive laws. However, image manipulation technology usually
destroys the internal relationship between content features, thus leaving
semantic clues for IML. In this paper, we propose a cognition-inspired
multimodal boundary-preserving network (CMB-Net). Specifically, CMB-Net
utilizes large language models (LLMs) to analyze manipulated regions within
images and generate prompt-based textual information to compensate for the lack
of semantic relationships in the visual information. Considering that the
erroneous texts induced by hallucination from LLMs will damage the accuracy of
IML, we propose an image-text central ambiguity module (ITCAM). It assigns
weights to the text features by quantifying the ambiguity between text and
image features, thereby ensuring the beneficial impact of textual information.
We also propose an image-text interaction module (ITIM) that aligns visual and
text features using a correlation matrix for fine-grained interaction. Finally,
inspired by invertible neural networks, we propose a restoration edge decoder
(RED) that mutually generates input and output features to preserve boundary
information in manipulated regions without loss. Extensive experiments show
that CMB-Net outperforms most existing IML models.

Abstract: Offline camera calibration techniques typically employ parametric or generic
camera models. Selecting parametric models relies heavily on user experience,
and an inappropriate camera model can significantly affect calibration
accuracy. Meanwhile, generic calibration methods involve complex procedures and
cannot provide traditional intrinsic parameters. This paper reveals a pose
ambiguity in the pose solutions of generic calibration methods that
irreversibly impacts subsequent pose estimation. A linear solver and a
nonlinear optimization are proposed to address this ambiguity issue. Then a
global optimization hybrid calibration method is introduced to integrate
generic and parametric models together, which improves extrinsic parameter
accuracy of generic calibration and mitigates overfitting and numerical
instability in parametric calibration. Simulation and real-world experimental
results demonstrate that the generic-parametric hybrid calibration method
consistently excels across various lens types and noise contamination,
hopefully serving as a reliable and accurate solution for camera calibration in
complex scenarios.

Abstract: Visual speech recognition is a technique to identify spoken content in silent
speech videos, which has raised significant attention in recent years.
Advancements in data-driven deep learning methods have significantly improved
both the speed and accuracy of recognition. However, these deep learning
methods can be effected by visual disturbances, such as lightning conditions,
skin texture and other user-specific features. Data-driven approaches could
reduce the performance degradation caused by these visual disturbances using
models pretrained on large-scale datasets. But these methods often require
large amounts of training data and computational resources, making them costly.
To reduce the influence of user-specific features and enhance performance with
limited data, this paper proposed a landmark guided visual feature extractor.
Facial landmarks are used as auxiliary information to aid in training the
visual feature extractor. A spatio-temporal multi-graph convolutional network
is designed to fully exploit the spatial locations and spatio-temporal features
of facial landmarks. Additionally, a multi-level lip dynamic fusion framework
is introduced to combine the spatio-temporal features of the landmarks with the
visual features extracted from the raw video frames. Experimental results show
that this approach performs well with limited data and also improves the
model's accuracy on unseen speakers.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASM-UNet是一种基于Mamba的新型架构，通过自适应扫描顺序解决细粒度分割（FGS）中的个体差异问题，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有粗粒度分割方法在细粒度分割中表现不佳，且Mamba模型依赖固定扫描顺序，难以适应个体差异。

Method: 提出ASM-UNet，结合群体共性和个体差异生成自适应扫描分数，动态指导扫描顺序。

Result: 在ACDC、Synapse和BTMS数据集上，ASM-UNet在粗粒度和细粒度分割任务中均表现优异。

Conclusion: ASM-UNet通过自适应扫描顺序有效解决了细粒度分割中的个体差异问题，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Precise lesion resection depends on accurately identifying fine-grained
anatomical structures. While many coarse-grained segmentation (CGS) methods
have been successful in large-scale segmentation (e.g., organs), they fall
short in clinical scenarios requiring fine-grained segmentation (FGS), which
remains challenging due to frequent individual variations in small-scale
anatomical structures. Although recent Mamba-based models have advanced medical
image segmentation, they often rely on fixed manually-defined scanning orders,
which limit their adaptability to individual variations in FGS. To address
this, we propose ASM-UNet, a novel Mamba-based architecture for FGS. It
introduces adaptive scan scores to dynamically guide the scanning order,
generated by combining group-level commonalities and individual-level
variations. Experiments on two public datasets (ACDC and Synapse) and a newly
proposed challenging biliary tract FGS dataset, namely BTMS, demonstrate that
ASM-UNet achieves superior performance in both CGS and FGS tasks. Our code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/YqunYang/ASM-UNet.

TL;DR: MiraMo框架通过高效线性注意力、运动残差学习和DCT噪声优化，提升图像动画的效率和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像动画中外观一致性和运动平滑性的挑战，同时降低计算资源需求。

Method: 采用线性注意力替代传统自注意力，引入运动残差学习和DCT噪声优化策略。

Result: 实验证明MiraMo在生成一致性、平滑性和可控性动画方面优于现有方法，且推理速度更快。

Conclusion: MiraMo为图像动画提供了一种高效、一致的解决方案，并展示了在运动迁移和视频编辑中的潜力。

Abstract: Image animation has seen significant progress, driven by the powerful
generative capabilities of diffusion models. However, maintaining appearance
consistency with static input images and mitigating abrupt motion transitions
in generated animations remain persistent challenges. While text-to-video (T2V)
generation has demonstrated impressive performance with diffusion transformer
models, the image animation field still largely relies on U-Net-based diffusion
models, which lag behind the latest T2V approaches. Moreover, the quadratic
complexity of vanilla self-attention mechanisms in Transformers imposes heavy
computational demands, making image animation particularly resource-intensive.
To address these issues, we propose MiraMo, a framework designed to enhance
efficiency, appearance consistency, and motion smoothness in image animation.
Specifically, MiraMo introduces three key elements: (1) A foundational
text-to-video architecture replacing vanilla self-attention with efficient
linear attention to reduce computational overhead while preserving generation
quality; (2) A novel motion residual learning paradigm that focuses on modeling
motion dynamics rather than directly predicting frames, improving temporal
consistency; and (3) A DCT-based noise refinement strategy during inference to
suppress sudden motion artifacts, complemented by a dynamics control module to
balance motion smoothness and expressiveness. Extensive experiments against
state-of-the-art methods validate the superiority of MiraMo in generating
consistent, smooth, and controllable animations with accelerated inference
speed. Additionally, we demonstrate the versatility of MiraMo through
applications in motion transfer and video editing tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用Transformer和集合论原理改进高光谱视频跟踪的方法，通过建模光谱和空间交互，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注空间交互，忽略了光谱交互，导致性能不佳。

Method: 使用Transformer建立波段间空间关系，并基于集合论的包含-排除原理建模光谱交互，同时引入光谱损失函数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在跟踪性能上达到最优。

Conclusion: 通过光谱和空间交互的联合建模，显著提升了高光谱视频跟踪的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Hyperspectral videos (HSVs), with their inherent spatial-spectral-temporal
structure, offer distinct advantages in challenging tracking scenarios such as
cluttered backgrounds and small objects. However, existing methods primarily
focus on spatial interactions between the template and search regions, often
overlooking spectral interactions, leading to suboptimal performance. To
address this issue, this paper investigates spectral interactions from both the
architectural and training perspectives. At the architectural level, we first
establish band-wise long-range spatial relationships between the template and
search regions using Transformers. We then model spectral interactions using
the inclusion-exclusion principle from set theory, treating them as the union
of spatial interactions across all bands. This enables the effective
integration of both shared and band-specific spatial cues. At the training
level, we introduce a spectral loss to enforce material distribution alignment
between the template and predicted regions, enhancing robustness to shape
deformation and appearance variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our tracker achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance. The source code,
trained models and results will be publicly available via

Motivation: 现有数据缺乏统一的4D标注和任务驱动的评估协议，无法支持细粒度的时空推理，尤其是物体和人的运动及其交互。

Method: 构建了包含RGB-D视频、相机位姿、实例掩码和4D边界框的EgoDynamic4D数据集，设计了12种动态问答任务，并提出了一种端到端的时空推理框架。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在EgoDynamic4D上表现优于基线，验证了多模态时间建模的有效性。

Conclusion: EgoDynamic4D和提出的框架为动态4D场景理解提供了新的基准和方法。

Abstract: Understanding dynamic 4D scenes from an egocentric perspective-modeling
changes in 3D spatial structure over time-is crucial for human-machine
interaction, autonomous navigation, and embodied intelligence. While existing
egocentric datasets contain dynamic scenes, they lack unified 4D annotations
and task-driven evaluation protocols for fine-grained spatio-temporal
reasoning, especially on motion of objects and human, together with their
interactions. To address this gap, we introduce EgoDynamic4D, a novel QA
benchmark on highly dynamic scenes, comprising RGB-D video, camera poses,
globally unique instance masks, and 4D bounding boxes. We construct 927K QA
pairs accompanied by explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT), enabling verifiable,
step-by-step spatio-temporal reasoning. We design 12 dynamic QA tasks covering
agent motion, human-object interaction, trajectory prediction, relation
understanding, and temporal-causal reasoning, with fine-grained,
multidimensional metrics. To tackle these tasks, we propose an end-to-end
spatio-temporal reasoning framework that unifies dynamic and static scene
information, using instance-aware feature encoding, time and camera encoding,
and spatially adaptive down-sampling to compress large 4D scenes into token
sequences manageable by LLMs. Experiments on EgoDynamic4D show that our method
consistently outperforms baselines, validating the effectiveness of multimodal
temporal modeling for egocentric dynamic scene understanding.

Result: 实验证明SLC在多种基准测试和大型VLM中有效，支持开源和闭源模型。

Conclusion: SLC是首个训练高效且支持广泛个性化应用的框架，代码将开源。

Abstract: Personalizing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to transform them into daily
assistants has emerged as a trending research direction. However, leading
companies like OpenAI continue to increase model size and develop complex
designs such as the chain of thought (CoT). While large VLMs are proficient in
complex multi-modal understanding, their high training costs and limited access
via paid APIs restrict direct personalization. Conversely, small VLMs are
easily personalized and freely available, but they lack sufficient reasoning
capabilities. Inspired by this, we propose a novel collaborative framework
named Small-Large Collaboration (SLC) for large VLM personalization, where the
small VLM is responsible for generating personalized information, while the
large model integrates this personalized information to deliver accurate
responses. To effectively incorporate personalized information, we develop a
test-time reflection strategy, preventing the potential hallucination of the
small VLM. Since SLC only needs to train a meta personalized small VLM for the
large VLMs, the overall process is training-efficient. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first training-efficient framework that supports both
open-source and closed-source large VLMs, enabling broader real-world
personalized applications. We conduct thorough experiments across various
benchmarks and large VLMs to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SLC
framework. The code will be released at https://github.com/Hhankyangg/SLC.

Motivation: 现有OOD检测和增量学习方法在开放世界场景中存在局限性，无法满足模型自主更新知识的需求。

Method: 提出OpenHAIV框架，将OOD检测、新类发现和增量持续微调统一为一个流程。

Result: 模型能够在开放世界环境中自主获取和更新知识。

Conclusion: OpenHAIV为开放世界识别提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Substantial progress has been made in various techniques for open-world
recognition. Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods can effectively
distinguish between known and unknown classes in the data, while incremental
learning enables continuous model knowledge updates. However, in open-world
scenarios, these approaches still face limitations. Relying solely on OOD
detection does not facilitate knowledge updates in the model, and incremental
fine-tuning typically requires supervised conditions, which significantly
deviate from open-world settings. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes OpenHAIV, a novel framework that integrates OOD detection, new class
discovery, and incremental continual fine-tuning into a unified pipeline. This
framework allows models to autonomously acquire and update knowledge in
open-world environments. The proposed framework is available at

Abstract: Understanding internal feature representations of deep neural networks (DNNs)
is a fundamental step toward model interpretability. Inspired by neuroscience
methods that probe biological neurons using visual stimuli, recent deep
learning studies have employed Activation Maximization (AM) to synthesize
inputs that elicit strong responses from artificial neurons. In this work, we
propose a unified feature visualization framework applicable to both
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). Unlike
prior efforts that predominantly focus on the last output-layer neurons in
CNNs, we extend feature visualization to intermediate layers as well, offering
deeper insights into the hierarchical structure of learned feature
representations. Furthermore, we investigate how activation maximization can be
leveraged to generate adversarial examples, revealing potential vulnerabilities
and decision boundaries of DNNs. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach in both traditional CNNs and modern ViT, highlighting its
generalizability and interpretive value.

Result: 在多种医学图像分割任务中表现优异，尤其在BSL设置下，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SynMatch为标签稀缺问题提供了一种高效解决方案，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Label scarcity remains a major challenge in deep learning-based medical image
segmentation. Recent studies use strong-weak pseudo supervision to leverage
unlabeled data. However, performance is often hindered by inconsistencies
between pseudo labels and their corresponding unlabeled images. In this work,
we propose \textbf{SynMatch}, a novel framework that sidesteps the need for
improving pseudo labels by synthesizing images to match them instead.
Specifically, SynMatch synthesizes images using texture and shape features
extracted from the same segmentation model that generates the corresponding
pseudo labels for unlabeled images. This design enables the generation of
highly consistent synthesized-image-pseudo-label pairs without requiring any
training parameters for image synthesis. We extensively evaluate SynMatch
across diverse medical image segmentation tasks under semi-supervised learning
(SSL), weakly-supervised learning (WSL), and barely-supervised learning (BSL)
settings with increasingly limited annotations. The results demonstrate that
SynMatch achieves superior performance, especially in the most challenging BSL
setting. For example, it outperforms the recent strong-weak pseudo
supervision-based method by 29.71\% and 10.05\% on the polyp segmentation task
with 5\% and 10\% scribble annotations, respectively. The code will be released

Conclusion: BEVANet在性能和效率上均达到先进水平。

Abstract: Real-time semantic segmentation presents the dual challenge of designing
efficient architectures that capture large receptive fields for semantic
understanding while also refining detailed contours. Vision transformers model
long-range dependencies effectively but incur high computational cost. To
address these challenges, we introduce the Large Kernel Attention (LKA)
mechanism. Our proposed Bilateral Efficient Visual Attention Network (BEVANet)
expands the receptive field to capture contextual information and extracts
visual and structural features using Sparse Decomposed Large Separable Kernel
Attentions (SDLSKA). The Comprehensive Kernel Selection (CKS) mechanism
dynamically adapts the receptive field to further enhance performance.
Furthermore, the Deep Large Kernel Pyramid Pooling Module (DLKPPM) enriches
contextual features by synergistically combining dilated convolutions and large
kernel attention. The bilateral architecture facilitates frequent branch
communication, and the Boundary Guided Adaptive Fusion (BGAF) module enhances
boundary delineation by integrating spatial and semantic features under
boundary guidance. BEVANet achieves real-time segmentation at 33 FPS, yielding
79.3% mIoU without pretraining and 81.0% mIoU on Cityscapes after ImageNet
pretraining, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. The code and model is

Abstract: Continual learning aims to equip AI systems with the ability to continuously

Result: DocR1在多页任务中达到SOTA性能，同时在单页任务中保持强劲表现。

Conclusion: EviGRPO框架有效提升了MLLM在多页文档理解中的能力，为有限监督下的高性能模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Understanding multi-page documents poses a significant challenge for
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as it requires fine-grained visual
comprehension and multi-hop reasoning across pages. While prior work has
explored reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing advanced reasoning in MLLMs,
its application to multi-page document understanding remains underexplored. In
this paper, we introduce DocR1, an MLLM trained with a novel RL framework,
Evidence Page-Guided GRPO (EviGRPO). EviGRPO incorporates an evidence-aware
reward mechanism that promotes a coarse-to-fine reasoning strategy, guiding the
model to first retrieve relevant pages before generating answers. This training
paradigm enables us to build high-quality models with limited supervision. To
support this, we design a two-stage annotation pipeline and a curriculum
learning strategy, based on which we construct two datasets: EviBench, a
high-quality training set with 4.8k examples, and ArxivFullQA, an evaluation
benchmark with 8.6k QA pairs based on scientific papers. Extensive experiments
across a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate that DocR1 achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multi-page tasks, while consistently
maintaining strong results on single-page benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像描述方法依赖对象检测器或GCN，存在冗余信息、GCN构建困难和训练成本高的问题。

Method: RORPCap通过对象和关系提取模型提取关键词，结合预定义提示模板和Mamba映射网络，生成文本增强特征嵌入，最终由GPT-2生成描述。

Result: 在MS-COCO数据集上，RORPCap仅需2.6小时训练，CIDEr得分120.5%，SPICE得分22.0%，性能与检测器和GCN模型相当。

Conclusion: RORPCap是一种高效且性能优越的图像描述替代方案。

Abstract: Image captioning aims to generate natural language descriptions for input
images in an open-form manner. To accurately generate descriptions related to
the image, a critical step in image captioning is to identify objects and
understand their relations within the image. Modern approaches typically
capitalize on object detectors or combine detectors with Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN). However, these models suffer from redundant detection
information, difficulty in GCN construction, and high training costs. To
address these issues, a Retrieval-based Objects and Relations Prompt for Image
Captioning (RORPCap) is proposed, inspired by the fact that image-text
retrieval can provide rich semantic information for input images. RORPCap
employs an Objects and relations Extraction Model to extract object and
relation words from the image. These words are then incorporate into predefined
prompt templates and encoded as prompt embeddings. Next, a Mamba-based mapping
network is designed to quickly map image embeddings extracted by CLIP to
visual-text embeddings. Finally, the resulting prompt embeddings and
visual-text embeddings are concatenated to form textual-enriched feature
embeddings, which are fed into a GPT-2 model for caption generation. Extensive
experiments conducted on the widely used MS-COCO dataset show that the RORPCap
requires only 2.6 hours under cross-entropy loss training, achieving 120.5%
CIDEr score and 22.0% SPICE score on the "Karpathy" test split. RORPCap
achieves comparable performance metrics to detector-based and GCN-based models
with the shortest training time and demonstrates its potential as an
alternative for image captioning.

iteratively refining visual elements' space-time representation, guided by
language until semantic gaps are minimal. A Planner module schedules language
guidance by decomposing complex linguistic prompts into short sentence chains.
The Refiner processes each short sentence, a noun-phrase and verb-phrase pair,
to direct visual tokens' self-attention across space then time, achieving
efficient single-step refinement. A recurrent system chains these steps,
maintaining refined visual token representations. The final representation
feeds into task-specific heads for alignment generation. We demonstrate
Planner-Refiner's effectiveness on two video-language alignment tasks:
Referring Video Object Segmentation and Temporal Grounding with varying
language complexity. We further introduce a new MeViS-X benchmark to assess
models' capability with long queries. Superior performance versus
state-of-the-art methods on these benchmarks shows the approach's potential,
especially for complex prompts.

TL;DR: CoAR是一种新型框架，通过冻结预训练参数，仅用极少参数实现定制化图像生成，解决了现有方法的过拟合和计算成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有定制化生成方法依赖全微调或适配器，成本高且易过拟合或遗忘。

Method: CoAR采用分层多模态上下文学习策略，引入正则化保持预训练分布并锚定上下文标记。

Result: CoAR在主题和风格个性化上表现优异，计算和内存效率显著提升。

Conclusion: CoAR以极低参数成本实现高性能，优于现有方法。

Abstract: The unified autoregressive (AR) model excels at multimodal understanding and
generation, but its potential for customized image generation remains
underexplored. Existing customized generation methods rely on full fine-tuning
or adapters, making them costly and prone to overfitting or catastrophic
forgetting. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CoAR}, a novel framework for
injecting subject concepts into the unified AR models while keeping all
pre-trained parameters completely frozen. CoAR learns effective, specific
subject representations with only a minimal number of parameters using a
Layerwise Multimodal Context Learning strategy. To address overfitting and
language drift, we further introduce regularization that preserves the
pre-trained distribution and anchors context tokens to improve subject fidelity
and re-contextualization. Additionally, CoAR supports training-free subject
customization in a user-provided style. Experiments demonstrate that CoAR
achieves superior performance on both subject-driven personalization and style
personalization, while delivering significant gains in computational and memory
efficiency. Notably, CoAR tunes less than \textbf{0.05\%} of the parameters
while achieving competitive performance compared to recent Proxy-Tuning. Code:

TL;DR: SODiff是一种新颖的一步扩散模型，用于JPEG伪影去除，通过语义导向的预训练扩散模型和自适应时间预测器，显著提升了恢复效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: JPEG高压缩比会引入严重视觉伪影，现有深度学习方法难以恢复复杂纹理细节，导致输出过度平滑。

Method: 提出SODiff模型，结合语义对齐图像提示提取器（SAIPE）和质量因子感知时间预测器，优化扩散过程。

Result: 实验表明，SODiff在视觉质量和定量指标上均优于现有领先方法。

Conclusion: SODiff通过语义导向和自适应时间预测，有效提升了JPEG伪影去除的性能。

Abstract: JPEG, as a widely used image compression standard, often introduces severe
visual artifacts when achieving high compression ratios. Although existing deep
learning-based restoration methods have made considerable progress, they often
struggle to recover complex texture details, resulting in over-smoothed
outputs. To overcome these limitations, we propose SODiff, a novel and
efficient semantic-oriented one-step diffusion model for JPEG artifacts
removal. Our core idea is that effective restoration hinges on providing
semantic-oriented guidance to the pre-trained diffusion model, thereby fully
leveraging its powerful generative prior. To this end, SODiff incorporates a
semantic-aligned image prompt extractor (SAIPE). SAIPE extracts rich features
from low-quality (LQ) images and projects them into an embedding space
semantically aligned with that of the text encoder. Simultaneously, it
preserves crucial information for faithful reconstruction. Furthermore, we
propose a quality factor-aware time predictor that implicitly learns the
compression quality factor (QF) of the LQ image and adaptively selects the
optimal denoising start timestep for the diffusion process. Extensive
experimental results show that our SODiff outperforms recent leading methods in
both visual quality and quantitative metrics. Code is available at:

TL;DR: GS4Buildings利用语义3D建筑模型改进2D高斯泼溅（2DGS），提升大规模复杂城市场景中的建筑表面重建效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统2DGS在遮挡频繁的大规模城市场景中表现不佳，导致建筑重建不完整。

Method: 直接从LoD2语义3D建筑模型初始化高斯，并引入先验深度和法线图优化重建过程。

Result: 在城市场景数据集中，重建完整度提升20.5%，几何精度提高32.8%。

Conclusion: 语义建筑模型集成有助于推动高斯泼溅技术在智慧城市等实际应用中的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting (GS) have demonstrated its
effectiveness in photo-realistic rendering and 3D reconstruction. Among these,
2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) is particularly suitable for surface
reconstruction due to its flattened Gaussian representation and integrated
normal regularization. However, its performance often degrades in large-scale
and complex urban scenes with frequent occlusions, leading to incomplete
building reconstructions. We propose GS4Buildings, a novel prior-guided
Gaussian Splatting method leveraging the ubiquity of semantic 3D building
models for robust and scalable building surface reconstruction. Instead of
relying on traditional Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines, GS4Buildings
initializes Gaussians directly from low-level Level of Detail (LoD)2 semantic
3D building models. Moreover, we generate prior depth and normal maps from the
planar building geometry and incorporate them into the optimization process,
providing strong geometric guidance for surface consistency and structural
accuracy. We also introduce an optional building-focused mode that limits
reconstruction to building regions, achieving a 71.8% reduction in Gaussian
primitives and enabling a more efficient and compact representation.
Experiments on urban datasets demonstrate that GS4Buildings improves
reconstruction completeness by 20.5% and geometric accuracy by 32.8%. These
results highlight the potential of semantic building model integration to
advance GS-based reconstruction toward real-world urban applications such as
smart cities and digital twins. Our project is available:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的全色锐化方法在跨传感器数据上泛化能力差，且现有解决方案（如重新训练或零样本方法）耗时或需要额外数据。

Method: 通过模块化解耦发现关键接口，引入特征裁剪器，利用物理感知的无监督损失高效训练，并采用分块并行推理提升效率。

Result: 在跨传感器场景下显著提升性能，训练和推理时间极短（如512x512x8图像仅需0.2秒），比零样本方法快100倍以上。

Conclusion: 该方法在质量和效率上均达到领先水平，为跨传感器全色锐化提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning methods for pansharpening have advanced rapidly, yet models
pretrained on data from a specific sensor often generalize poorly to data from
other sensors. Existing methods to tackle such cross-sensor degradation include
retraining model or zero-shot methods, but they are highly time-consuming or
even need extra training data. To address these challenges, our method first
performs modular decomposition on deep learning-based pansharpening models,
revealing a general yet critical interface where high-dimensional fused
features begin mapping to the channel space of the final image. % may need
revisement A Feature Tailor is then integrated at this interface to address
cross-sensor degradation at the feature level, and is trained efficiently with
physics-aware unsupervised losses. Moreover, our method operates in a
patch-wise manner, training on partial patches and performing parallel
inference on all patches to boost efficiency. Our method offers two key
advantages: (1) $\textit{Improved Generalization Ability}$: it significantly
enhance performance in cross-sensor cases. (2) $\textit{Low Generalization
Cost}$: it achieves sub-second training and inference, requiring only partial
test inputs and no external data, whereas prior methods often take minutes or
even hours. Experiments on the real-world data from multiple datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art quality and efficiency in
tackling cross-sensor degradation. For example, training and inference of
$512\times512\times8$ image within $\textit{0.2 seconds}$ and
$4000\times4000\times8$ image within $\textit{3 seconds}$ at the fastest
setting on a commonly used RTX 3090 GPU, which is over 100 times faster than
zero-shot methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始3DGS在多视图重建中表现优异，但在稀疏视图场景下效果不佳。DIP-GS旨在利用DIP先验提升稀疏视图重建能力。

Method: 通过结合DIP先验和3DGS，采用由粗到细的方式学习场景表示，仅依赖输入帧而不使用预训练模型。

Result: DIP-GS在稀疏视图重建任务中取得了竞争性的SOTA结果。

Conclusion: DIP-GS展示了在稀疏视图场景下的强大能力，为3D重建提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a leading 3D scene reconstruction method,
obtaining high-quality reconstruction with real-time rendering runtime
performance. The main idea behind 3DGS is to represent the scene as a
collection of 3D gaussians, while learning their parameters to fit the given
views of the scene. While achieving superior performance in the presence of
many views, 3DGS struggles with sparse view reconstruction, where the input
views are sparse and do not fully cover the scene and have low overlaps. In
this paper, we propose DIP-GS, a Deep Image Prior (DIP) 3DGS representation. By
using the DIP prior, which utilizes internal structure and patterns, with
coarse-to-fine manner, DIP-based 3DGS can operate in scenarios where vanilla
3DGS fails, such as sparse view recovery. Note that our approach does not use
any pre-trained models such as generative models and depth estimation, but
rather relies only on the input frames. Among such methods, DIP-GS obtains
state-of-the-art (SOTA) competitive results on various sparse-view
reconstruction tasks, demonstrating its capabilities.

Method: 采用自适应压缩机制减少输入事件量，两阶段优化提升事件流解析能力，文本引导查询和分层聚类提取代表性特征。

Result: LET-US在长事件流的描述准确性和语义理解上优于现有MLLM。

Conclusion: LET-US为长事件流与文本理解开辟了新方向，数据集和模型将公开。

Abstract: Event cameras output event streams as sparse, asynchronous data with
microsecond-level temporal resolution, enabling visual perception with low
latency and a high dynamic range. While existing Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) have achieved significant success in understanding and analyzing
RGB video content, they either fail to interpret event streams effectively or
remain constrained to very short sequences. In this paper, we introduce LET-US,
a framework for long event-stream--text comprehension that employs an adaptive
compression mechanism to reduce the volume of input events while preserving
critical visual details. LET-US thus establishes a new frontier in cross-modal
inferential understanding over extended event sequences. To bridge the
substantial modality gap between event streams and textual representations, we
adopt a two-stage optimization paradigm that progressively equips our model
with the capacity to interpret event-based scenes. To handle the voluminous
temporal information inherent in long event streams, we leverage text-guided
cross-modal queries for feature reduction, augmented by hierarchical clustering
and similarity computation to distill the most representative event features.
Moreover, we curate and construct a large-scale event-text aligned dataset to
train our model, achieving tighter alignment of event features within the LLM
embedding space. We also develop a comprehensive benchmark covering a diverse
set of tasks -- reasoning, captioning, classification, temporal localization
and moment retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate that LET-US outperforms
prior state-of-the-art MLLMs in both descriptive accuracy and semantic
comprehension on long-duration event streams. All datasets, codes, and models
will be publicly available.

Result: 优化后的MLLM在RefCOCO/+/g数据集上性能提升了5.6%/6.9%/7.0%。

Conclusion: 研究结果为MLLMs在视觉定位任务中的设计提供了系统性指导，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Fine-grained multimodal capability in Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) has emerged as a critical research direction, particularly for tackling
the visual grounding (VG) problem. Despite the strong performance achieved by
existing approaches, they often employ disparate design choices when
fine-tuning MLLMs for VG, lacking systematic verification to support these
designs. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive study of
various design choices that impact the VG performance of MLLMs. We conduct our
analysis using LLaVA-1.5, which has been widely adopted in prior empirical
studies of MLLMs. While more recent models exist, we follow this convention to
ensure our findings remain broadly applicable and extendable to other
architectures. We cover two key aspects: (1) exploring different visual
grounding paradigms in MLLMs, identifying the most effective design, and
providing our insights; and (2) conducting ablation studies on the design of
grounding data to optimize MLLMs' fine-tuning for the VG task. Finally, our
findings contribute to a stronger MLLM for VG, achieving improvements of +5.6%
/ +6.9% / +7.0% on RefCOCO/+/g over the LLaVA-1.5.

Conclusion: ForensicsSAM成功解决了PEFT方法的对抗攻击脆弱性问题，为IFDL任务提供了鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a popular strategy for
adapting large vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model
(SAM) and LLaVA, to downstream tasks like image forgery detection and
localization (IFDL). However, existing PEFT-based approaches overlook their
vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we show that highly
transferable adversarial images can be crafted solely via the upstream model,
without accessing the downstream model or training data, significantly
degrading the IFDL performance. To address this, we propose ForensicsSAM, a
unified IFDL framework with built-in adversarial robustness. Our design is
guided by three key ideas: (1) To compensate for the lack of forgery-relevant
knowledge in the frozen image encoder, we inject forgery experts into each
transformer block to enhance its ability to capture forgery artifacts. These
forgery experts are always activated and shared across any input images. (2) To
detect adversarial images, we design an light-weight adversary detector that
learns to capture structured, task-specific artifact in RGB domain, enabling
reliable discrimination across various attack methods. (3) To resist
adversarial attacks, we inject adversary experts into the global attention
layers and MLP modules to progressively correct feature shifts induced by
adversarial noise. These adversary experts are adaptively activated by the
adversary detector, thereby avoiding unnecessary interference with clean
images. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
ForensicsSAM achieves superior resistance to various adversarial attack
methods, while also delivering state-of-the-art performance in image-level
forgery detection and pixel-level forgery localization. The resource is

Abstract: In this paper, we propose \textbf{CharacterShot}, a controllable and
consistent 4D character animation framework that enables any individual
designer to create dynamic 3D characters (i.e., 4D character animation) from a
single reference character image and a 2D pose sequence. We begin by
pretraining a powerful 2D character animation model based on a cutting-edge
DiT-based image-to-video model, which allows for any 2D pose sequnce as
controllable signal. We then lift the animation model from 2D to 3D through
introducing dual-attention module together with camera prior to generate
multi-view videos with spatial-temporal and spatial-view consistency. Finally,
we employ a novel neighbor-constrained 4D gaussian splatting optimization on
these multi-view videos, resulting in continuous and stable 4D character
representations. Moreover, to improve character-centric performance, we
construct a large-scale dataset Character4D, containing 13,115 unique
characters with diverse appearances and motions, rendered from multiple
viewpoints. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark,
CharacterBench, demonstrate that our approach outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods. Code, models, and datasets will be publicly available

Conclusion: CLUE为伪造图像定位提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: The increasing accessibility of image editing tools and generative AI has led
to a proliferation of visually convincing forgeries, compromising the
authenticity of digital media. In this paper, in addition to leveraging
distortions from conventional forgeries, we repurpose the mechanism of a
state-of-the-art (SOTA) text-to-image synthesis model by exploiting its
internal generative process, turning it into a high-fidelity forgery
localization tool. To this end, we propose CLUE (Capture Latent Uncovered
Evidence), a framework that employs Low- Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to
parameter-efficiently reconfigure Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3) as a forensic
feature extractor. Our approach begins with the strategic use of SD3's
Rectified Flow (RF) mechanism to inject noise at varying intensities into the
latent representation, thereby steering the LoRAtuned denoising process to
amplify subtle statistical inconsistencies indicative of a forgery. To
complement the latent analysis with high-level semantic context and precise
spatial details, our method incorporates contextual features from the image
encoder of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), which is parameter-efficiently
adapted to better trace the boundaries of forged regions. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate CLUE's SOTA generalization performance, significantly outperforming
prior methods. Furthermore, CLUE shows superior robustness against common
post-processing attacks and Online Social Networks (OSNs). Code is publicly

Conclusion: 研究为未来多模态系统提供了针对性的偏见缓解策略，明确了视觉和文本编码器的偏见贡献差异。

Abstract: Vision Language Models achieve impressive multi-modal performance but often
inherit gender biases from their training data. This bias might be coming from
both the vision and text modalities. In this work, we dissect the contributions
of vision and text backbones to these biases by applying targeted debiasing
using Counterfactual Data Augmentation and Task Vector methods. Inspired by
data-efficient approaches in hate-speech classification, we introduce a novel
metric, Degree of Stereotypicality and a corresponding debiasing method, Data
Augmentation Using Degree of Stereotypicality - DAUDoS, to reduce bias with
minimal computational cost. We curate a gender annotated dataset and evaluate
all methods on VisoGender benchmark to quantify improvements and identify
dominant source of bias. Our results show that CDA reduces the gender gap by 6%
and DAUDoS by 3% but using only one-third of the data. Both methods also
improve the model's ability to correctly identify gender in images by 3%, with
DAUDoS achieving this improvement using only almost one-third of training data.
From our experiment's, we observed that CLIP's vision encoder is more biased
whereas PaliGemma2's text encoder is more biased. By identifying whether bias
stems more from vision or text encoders, our work enables more targeted and
effective bias mitigation strategies in future multi-modal systems.

Conclusion: 该框架模型无关，适用于多种无监督骨干网络，为实际场景中不完美的训练数据提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of fully unsupervised image anomaly
detection (FUIAD), where training data may contain unlabeled anomalies.
Conventional methods assume anomaly-free training data, but real-world
contamination leads models to absorb anomalies as normal, degrading detection
performance. To mitigate this, we propose a two-stage framework that
systematically exploits inherent learning bias in models. The learning bias
stems from: (1) the statistical dominance of normal samples, driving models to
prioritize learning stable normal patterns over sparse anomalies, and (2)
feature-space divergence, where normal data exhibit high intra-class
consistency while anomalies display high diversity, leading to unstable model
responses. Leveraging the learning bias, stage 1 partitions the training set
into subsets, trains sub-models, and aggregates cross-model anomaly scores to
filter a purified dataset. Stage 2 trains the final detector on this dataset.
Experiments on the Real-IAD benchmark demonstrate superior anomaly detection
and localization performance under different noise conditions. Ablation studies
further validate the framework's contamination resilience, emphasizing the
critical role of learning bias exploitation. The model-agnostic design ensures
compatibility with diverse unsupervised backbones, offering a practical
solution for real-world scenarios with imperfect training data. Code is

Result: SOTA模型在准确性上表现优异（最高92%），但在推理一致性和逻辑性上得分低于45%。

Conclusion: AURA揭示了模型推理的缺陷，为更稳健的多模态评估提供了工具。

Abstract: Current audio-visual (AV) benchmarks focus on final answer accuracy,
overlooking the underlying reasoning process. This makes it difficult to
distinguish genuine comprehension from correct answers derived through flawed
reasoning or hallucinations. To address this, we introduce AURA (Audio-visual
Understanding and Reasoning Assessment), a benchmark for evaluating the
cross-modal reasoning capabilities of Audio-Visual Large Language Models
(AV-LLMs) and Omni-modal Language Models (OLMs). AURA includes questions across
six challenging cognitive domains, such as causality, timbre and pitch, tempo
and AV synchronization, unanswerability, implicit distractions, and skill
profiling, explicitly designed to be unanswerable from a single modality. This
forces models to construct a valid logical path grounded in both audio and
video, setting AURA apart from AV datasets that allow uni-modal shortcuts. To
assess reasoning traces, we propose a novel metric, AuraScore, which addresses
the lack of robust tools for evaluating reasoning fidelity. It decomposes
reasoning into two aspects: (i) Factual Consistency - whether reasoning is
grounded in perceptual evidence, and (ii) Core Inference - the logical validity
of each reasoning step. Evaluations of SOTA models on AURA reveal a critical
reasoning gap: although models achieve high accuracy (up to 92% on some tasks),
their Factual Consistency and Core Inference scores fall below 45%. This
discrepancy highlights that models often arrive at correct answers through
flawed logic, underscoring the need for our benchmark and paving the way for
more robust multimodal evaluation.

Abstract: In this paper, I present a comprehensive study comparing Photogrammetry and
Gaussian Splatting techniques for 3D model reconstruction and view synthesis. I
created a dataset of images from a real-world scene and constructed 3D models
using both methods. To evaluate the performance, I compared the models using
structural similarity index (SSIM), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), learned
perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS), and lp/mm resolution based on the
USAF resolution chart. A significant contribution of this work is the
development of a modified Gaussian Splatting repository, which I forked and
enhanced to enable rendering images from novel camera poses generated in the
Blender environment. This innovation allows for the synthesis of high-quality
novel views, showcasing the flexibility and potential of Gaussian Splatting. My
investigation extends to an augmented dataset that includes both original
ground images and novel views synthesized via Gaussian Splatting. This
augmented dataset was employed to generate a new photogrammetry model, which
was then compared against the original photogrammetry model created using only
the original images. The results demonstrate the efficacy of using Gaussian
Splatting to generate novel high-quality views and its potential to improve
photogrammetry-based 3D reconstructions. The comparative analysis highlights
the strengths and limitations of both approaches, providing valuable
information for applications in extended reality (XR), photogrammetry, and
autonomous vehicle simulations. Code is available at

TL;DR: VisR-Bench是一个多语言基准测试，用于长文档中的多模态检索，包含35K QA对和16种语言，评估了多种检索模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注英文文档检索或单页图像的多语言问答，缺乏对多语言长文档多模态检索的支持。

Method: 引入VisR-Bench，包含1.2K文档和35K QA对，覆盖16种语言和三种问题类型（图表、文本和表格），并评估了文本方法、多模态编码器和MLLM模型的性能。

Result: MLLM模型显著优于文本和多模态编码器模型，但在结构化表格和低资源语言上表现不佳。

Conclusion: VisR-Bench填补了多语言长文档多模态检索的空白，揭示了MLLM模型的优势和局限性。

Abstract: Most organizational data in this world are stored as documents, and visual
retrieval plays a crucial role in unlocking the collective intelligence from
all these documents. However, existing benchmarks focus on English-only
document retrieval or only consider multilingual question-answering on a
single-page image. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisR-Bench, a multilingual
benchmark designed for question-driven multimodal retrieval in long documents.
Our benchmark comprises over 35K high-quality QA pairs across 1.2K documents,
enabling fine-grained evaluation of multimodal retrieval. VisR-Bench spans
sixteen languages with three question types (figures, text, and tables),
offering diverse linguistic and question coverage. Unlike prior datasets, we
include queries without explicit answers, preventing models from relying on
superficial keyword matching. We evaluate various retrieval models, including
text-based methods, multimodal encoders, and MLLMs, providing insights into
their strengths and limitations. Our results show that while MLLMs
significantly outperform text-based and multimodal encoder models, they still
struggle with structured tables and low-resource languages, highlighting key
challenges in multilingual visual retrieval.

Abstract: Field trials are vital in herbicide research and development to assess
effects on crops and weeds under varied conditions. Traditionally, evaluations
rely on manual visual assessments, which are time-consuming, labor-intensive,
and subjective. Automating species and damage identification is challenging due
to subtle visual differences, but it can greatly enhance efficiency and
consistency.
  We present an improved segmentation model combining a general-purpose
self-supervised visual model with hierarchical inference based on botanical
taxonomy. Trained on a multi-year dataset (2018-2020) from Germany and Spain
using digital and mobile cameras, the model was tested on digital camera data
(year 2023) and drone imagery from the United States, Germany, and Spain (year
2024) to evaluate robustness under domain shift. This cross-device evaluation
marks a key step in assessing generalization across platforms of the model.
  Our model significantly improved species identification (F1-score: 0.52 to
0.85, R-squared: 0.75 to 0.98) and damage classification (F1-score: 0.28 to
0.44, R-squared: 0.71 to 0.87) over prior methods. Under domain shift (drone
images), it maintained strong performance with moderate degradation (species:
F1-score 0.60, R-squared 0.80; damage: F1-score 0.41, R-squared 0.62), where
earlier models failed.
  These results confirm the model's robustness and real-world applicability. It
is now deployed in BASF's phenotyping pipeline, enabling large-scale, automated
crop and weed monitoring across diverse geographies.

Result: 方法支持从全局到局部的编辑，适用于多种MM-DiT变体。

Conclusion: 研究填补了U-Net方法与新兴架构之间的差距，提供了对MM-DiT行为模式的深入理解。

Abstract: Transformer-based diffusion models have recently superseded traditional U-Net
architectures, with multimodal diffusion transformers (MM-DiT) emerging as the
dominant approach in state-of-the-art models like Stable Diffusion 3 and
Flux.1. Previous approaches have relied on unidirectional cross-attention
mechanisms, with information flowing from text embeddings to image latents. In
contrast, MMDiT introduces a unified attention mechanism that concatenates
input projections from both modalities and performs a single full attention
operation, allowing bidirectional information flow between text and image
branches. This architectural shift presents significant challenges for existing
editing techniques. In this paper, we systematically analyze MM-DiT's attention
mechanism by decomposing attention matrices into four distinct blocks,
revealing their inherent characteristics. Through these analyses, we propose a
robust, prompt-based image editing method for MM-DiT that supports global to
local edits across various MM-DiT variants, including few-step models. We
believe our findings bridge the gap between existing U-Net-based methods and
emerging architectures, offering deeper insights into MMDiT's behavioral
patterns.

Motivation: 医学图像诊断中，噪声标签和类别模糊实例会干扰top-rank学习的目标，影响准确性。

Result: 实验验证表明，该方法能有效检测和减少异常值，提高诊断可靠性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了医学图像诊断的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: In medical image processing, accurate diagnosis is of paramount importance.
Leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly top-rank learning, shows
significant promise by focusing on the most crucial instances. However,
challenges arise from noisy labels and class-ambiguous instances, which can
severely hinder the top-rank objective, as they may be erroneously placed among
the top-ranked instances. To address these, we propose a novel approach that
enhances toprank learning by integrating a rejection module. Cooptimized with
the top-rank loss, this module identifies and mitigates the impact of outliers
that hinder training effectiveness. The rejection module functions as an
additional branch, assessing instances based on a rejection function that
measures their deviation from the norm. Through experimental validation on a
medical dataset, our methodology demonstrates its efficacy in detecting and
mitigating outliers, improving the reliability and accuracy of medical image
diagnoses.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注英文文本，对更复杂的中文脚本关注不足，需要一种能够恢复低分辨率中文字符精确笔画的方法。

Method: 提出了一种结构先验，结合StyleGAN模型和基于码本的机制，生成高分辨率结构先验，同时保持字符结构和风格的多样性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能准确恢复退化字符的清晰笔画，适用于布局不规则的真实低分辨率中文文本。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结构先验和StyleGAN的协作，实现了高质量的中文文本图像超分辨率恢复。

Abstract: Faithful text image super-resolution (SR) is challenging because each
character has a unique structure and usually exhibits diverse font styles and
layouts. While existing methods primarily focus on English text, less attention
has been paid to more complex scripts like Chinese. In this paper, we introduce
a high-quality text image SR framework designed to restore the precise strokes
of low-resolution (LR) Chinese characters. Unlike methods that rely on
character recognition priors to regularize the SR task, we propose a novel
structure prior that offers structure-level guidance to enhance visual quality.
Our framework incorporates this structure prior within a StyleGAN model,
leveraging its generative capabilities for restoration. To maintain the
integrity of character structures while accommodating various font styles and
layouts, we implement a codebook-based mechanism that restricts the generative
space of StyleGAN. Each code in the codebook represents the structure of a
specific character, while the vector $w$ in StyleGAN controls the character's
style, including typeface, orientation, and location. Through the collaborative
interaction between the codebook and style, we generate a high-resolution
structure prior that aligns with LR characters both spatially and structurally.
Experiments demonstrate that this structure prior provides robust,
character-specific guidance, enabling the accurate restoration of clear strokes
in degraded characters, even for real-world LR Chinese text with irregular
layouts. Our code and pre-trained models will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像共享需遵守隐私法规（如HIPAA、DICOM标准），去标识化是保护患者隐私的关键，同时需确保数据对研究的实用性。

Method: 采用像素掩码、日期偏移、哈希、文本识别、替换和移除等方法，严格遵循标准处理数据集。

Result: 算法在MIDI-B挑战赛中正确执行99.92%的任务，排名第二（共22支团队）。

Conclusion: 当前方法仍有局限性，未来需进一步优化以提高去标识化效果。

Abstract: Image de-identification is essential for the public sharing of medical
images, particularly in the widely used Digital Imaging and Communications in
Medicine (DICOM) format as required by various regulations and standards,
including Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy
rules, the DICOM PS3.15 standard, and best practices recommended by the Cancer
Imaging Archive (TCIA). The Medical Image De-Identification Benchmark (MIDI-B)
Challenge at the 27th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and
Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2024) was organized to evaluate
rule-based DICOM image de-identification algorithms with a large dataset of
clinical DICOM images. In this report, we explore the critical challenges of
de-identifying DICOM images, emphasize the importance of removing personally
identifiable information (PII) to protect patient privacy while ensuring the
continued utility of medical data for research, diagnostics, and treatment, and
provide a comprehensive overview of the standards and regulations that govern
this process. Additionally, we detail the de-identification methods we applied
- such as pixel masking, date shifting, date hashing, text recognition, text
replacement, and text removal - to process datasets during the test phase in
strict compliance with these standards. According to the final leaderboard of
the MIDI-B challenge, the latest version of our solution algorithm correctly
executed 99.92% of the required actions and ranked 2nd out of 10 teams that
completed the challenge (from a total of 22 registered teams). Finally, we
conducted a thorough analysis of the resulting statistics and discussed the
limitations of current approaches and potential avenues for future improvement.

Method: 通过聚类非肿瘤区域的WSI级特征作为域，并采用两阶段对比学习（WSI级和patch级）减少域间差异。

Result: 有效减少了病理图像中的域偏移问题。

Conclusion: 该方法为病理图像域泛化提供了实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we address domain shifts in pathological images by focusing on
shifts within whole slide images~(WSIs), such as patient characteristics and
tissue thickness, rather than shifts between hospitals. Traditional approaches
rely on multi-hospital data, but data collection challenges often make this
impractical. Therefore, the proposed domain generalization method captures and
leverages intra-hospital domain shifts by clustering WSI-level features from
non-tumor regions and treating these clusters as domains. To mitigate domain
shift, we apply contrastive learning to reduce feature gaps between WSI pairs
from different clusters. The proposed method introduces a two-stage contrastive
learning approach WSI-level and patch-level contrastive learning to minimize
these gaps effectively.

Result: 实验表明，CoT-Pose模型能从抽象文本输入生成语义对齐的合理姿态。

Conclusion: 研究强调了高层次理解在姿态生成中的重要性，为推理增强方法开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have led to significant progress in image and
text generation tasks. However, the field of 3D human pose generation still
faces critical limitations. Most existing text-to-pose models rely heavily on
detailed (low-level) prompts that explicitly describe joint configurations. In
contrast, humans tend to communicate actions and intentions using abstract
(high-level) language. This mismatch results in a practical challenge for
deploying pose generation systems in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap,
we introduce a novel framework that incorporates CoT reasoning into the pose
generation process, enabling the interpretation of abstract prompts into
accurate 3D human poses. We further propose a data synthesis pipeline that
automatically generates triplets of abstract prompts, detailed prompts, and
corresponding 3D poses for training process. Experimental results demonstrate
that our reasoning-enhanced model, CoT-Pose, can effectively generate plausible
and semantically aligned poses from abstract textual inputs. This work
highlights the importance of high-level understanding in pose generation and
opens new directions for reasoning-enhanced approach for human pose generation.

Result: MatchVoice表现出良好的泛化能力，但仍需结合更广泛的视频-语言技术以进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 未来研究应整合更多视频-语言领域技术，以优化足球集锦解说的生成效果。

Abstract: Automated soccer commentary generation has evolved from template-based
systems to advanced neural architectures, aiming to produce real-time
descriptions of sports events. While frameworks like SoccerNet-Caption laid
foundational work, their inability to achieve fine-grained alignment between
video content and commentary remains a significant challenge. Recent efforts
such as MatchTime, with its MatchVoice model, address this issue through coarse
and fine-grained alignment techniques, achieving improved temporal
synchronization. In this paper, we extend MatchVoice to commentary generation
for soccer highlights using the GOAL dataset, which emphasizes short clips over
entire games. We conduct extensive experiments to reproduce the original
MatchTime results and evaluate our setup, highlighting the impact of different
training configurations and hardware limitations. Furthermore, we explore the
effect of varying window sizes on zero-shot performance. While MatchVoice
exhibits promising generalization capabilities, our findings suggest the need
for integrating techniques from broader video-language domains to further
enhance performance. Our code is available at

makes us easy to select pseudo-labels for various background regions. The

Motivation: 端到端模型在自动驾驶感知与规划中成为主流，但缺乏对中间功能模块的显式监督信号，导致机制不透明且可解释性有限。

Method: 构建了双粒度动态加权评分系统（DG-DWSS），提出统一量化指标（特征图质量分数），并开发了基于CLIP的特征图质量评估网络（CLIP-FMQE-Net）。

Result: 在NuScenes数据集上的实验表明，该方法提升了3D目标检测性能，NDS提高了3.89%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了特征表示质量和整体模型性能。

Abstract: End-to-end models are emerging as the mainstream in autonomous driving
perception and planning. However, the lack of explicit supervision signals for
intermediate functional modules leads to opaque operational mechanisms and
limited interpretability, making it challenging for traditional methods to
independently evaluate and train these modules. Pioneering in the issue, this
study builds upon the feature map-truth representation similarity-based
evaluation framework and proposes an independent evaluation method based on
Feature Map Convergence Score (FMCS). A Dual-Granularity Dynamic Weighted
Scoring System (DG-DWSS) is constructed, formulating a unified quantitative
metric - Feature Map Quality Score - to enable comprehensive evaluation of the
quality of feature maps generated by functional modules. A CLIP-based Feature
Map Quality Evaluation Network (CLIP-FMQE-Net) is further developed, combining
feature-truth encoders and quality score prediction heads to enable real-time
quality analysis of feature maps generated by functional modules. Experimental
results on the NuScenes dataset demonstrate that integrating our evaluation
module into the training improves 3D object detection performance, achieving a
3.89 percent gain in NDS. These results verify the effectiveness of our method
in enhancing feature representation quality and overall model performance.

suffer performance degradation under distribution shifts in downstream tasks,
particularly in the absence of labeled data. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)
addresses this challenge by enabling online optimization of VLMs during
inference, eliminating the need for annotated data. Cache-based TTA methods
exploit historical knowledge by maintaining a dynamic memory cache of
low-entropy or high-confidence samples, promoting efficient adaptation to
out-of-distribution data. Nevertheless, these methods face two critical
challenges: (1) unreliable confidence metrics under significant distribution
shifts, resulting in error accumulation within the cache and degraded
adaptation performance; and (2) rigid decision boundaries that fail to
accommodate substantial distributional variations, leading to suboptimal
predictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Adaptive Cache
Enhancement (ACE) framework, which constructs a robust cache by selectively
storing high-confidence or low-entropy image embeddings per class, guided by
dynamic, class-specific thresholds initialized from zero-shot statistics and
iteratively refined using an exponential moving average and
exploration-augmented updates. This approach enables adaptive, class-wise
decision boundaries, ensuring robust and accurate predictions across diverse
visual distributions. Extensive experiments on 15 diverse benchmark datasets
demonstrate that ACE achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior
robustness and generalization compared to existing TTA methods in challenging
out-of-distribution scenarios.

### [129] [Exploiting Layer Normalization Fine-tuning in Visual Transformer Foundation Models for Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07577)
*Zhaorui Tan,Tan Pan,Kaizhu Huang,Weimiao Yu,Kai Yao,Chen Jiang,Qiufeng Wang,Anh Nguyen,Xin Guo,Yuan Cheng,Xi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了LayerNorm在ViTs中的微调动态，提出了一种基于Fine-tuning Shift Ratio ($FSR$)的重新缩放机制，并通过实验验证了其在ID和OOD任务中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LayerNorm在ViTs中至关重要，但其在数据稀缺和领域转移下的微调动态尚未充分研究。本文旨在探索LayerNorm参数的变化如何反映源域和目标域的转移，并提出改进方法。

Method: 提出了一种基于$FSR$的重新缩放机制，使用标量$\lambda$调整LayerNorm的微调，并结合循环框架进一步优化。

Result: 实验表明，OOD任务通常具有较低的$FSR$和较高的$\lambda$，尤其在数据稀缺时；病理学数据下的ViTs表现更接近ID设置。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了LayerNorm在迁移学习中的动态特性，并提供了实用的微调策略。

Abstract: LayerNorm is pivotal in Vision Transformers (ViTs), yet its fine-tuning
dynamics under data scarcity and domain shifts remain underexplored. This paper
shows that shifts in LayerNorm parameters after fine-tuning (LayerNorm shifts)
are indicative of the transitions between source and target domains; its
efficacy is contingent upon the degree to which the target training samples
accurately represent the target domain, as quantified by our proposed
Fine-tuning Shift Ratio ($FSR$). Building on this, we propose a simple yet
effective rescaling mechanism using a scalar $\lambda$ that is negatively
correlated to $FSR$ to align learned LayerNorm shifts with those ideal shifts
achieved under fully representative data, combined with a cyclic framework that
further enhances the LayerNorm fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across
natural and pathological images, in both in-distribution (ID) and
out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, and various target training sample regimes
validate our framework. Notably, OOD tasks tend to yield lower $FSR$ and higher
$\lambda$ in comparison to ID cases, especially with scarce data, indicating
under-represented target training samples. Moreover, ViTFs fine-tuned on
pathological data behave more like ID settings, favoring conservative LayerNorm
updates. Our findings illuminate the underexplored dynamics of LayerNorm in
transfer learning and provide practical strategies for LayerNorm fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SOD模型依赖重型主干网络，计算成本高，限制了在边缘设备等实际场景中的应用。

Method: 采用粒度感知范式，设计多尺度解码器输出，结合粒度金字塔卷积（GPC）和跨尺度注意力（CSA）模块，高效融合特征。

Result: 在轻量级图像和视频SOD模型中达到最新性能。

Conclusion: GAPNet通过优化特征利用和语义解释，显著降低了计算成本，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: Recent salient object detection (SOD) models predominantly rely on
heavyweight backbones, incurring substantial computational cost and hindering
their practical application in various real-world settings, particularly on
edge devices. This paper presents GAPNet, a lightweight network built on the
granularity-aware paradigm for both image and video SOD. We assign saliency
maps of different granularities to supervise the multi-scale decoder
side-outputs: coarse object locations for high-level outputs and fine-grained
object boundaries for low-level outputs. Specifically, our decoder is built
with granularity-aware connections which fuse high-level features of low
granularity and low-level features of high granularity, respectively. To
support these connections, we design granular pyramid convolution (GPC) and
cross-scale attention (CSA) modules for efficient fusion of low-scale and
high-scale features, respectively. On top of the encoder, a self-attention
module is built to learn global information, enabling accurate object
localization with negligible computational cost. Unlike traditional U-Net-based
approaches, our proposed method optimizes feature utilization and semantic
interpretation while applying appropriate supervision at each processing stage.
Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves a new
state-of-the-art performance among lightweight image and video SOD models. Code

Conclusion: 该框架为语音病理的早期诊断提供了高效工具，有助于改善患者预后。

Abstract: Voice disorders significantly affect communication and quality of life,
requiring an early and accurate diagnosis. Traditional methods like
laryngoscopy are invasive, subjective, and often inaccessible. This research
proposes a noninvasive, machine learning-based framework for detecting voice
pathologies using phonation data.
  Phonation data from the Saarbr\"ucken Voice Database are analyzed using
acoustic features such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), chroma
features, and Mel spectrograms. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), including
LSTM and attention mechanisms, classify samples into normal and pathological
categories. Data augmentation techniques, including pitch shifting and Gaussian
noise addition, enhance model generalizability, while preprocessing ensures
signal quality. Scale-based features, such as H\"older and Hurst exponents,
further capture signal irregularities and long-term dependencies.
  The proposed framework offers a noninvasive, automated diagnostic tool for
early detection of voice pathologies, supporting AI-driven healthcare, and
improving patient outcomes.

Result: 在DF40数据集上，系统实现了高检测性能，并提供与Grad-CAM一致的高质量解释。

Conclusion: 该框架为可解释的深度伪造检测提供了可扩展方案，推动了可信赖和透明AI系统的发展。

Abstract: The proliferation of deepfake technologies poses urgent challenges and
serious risks to digital integrity, particularly within critical sectors such
as forensics, journalism, and the legal system. While existing detection
systems have made significant progress in classification accuracy, they
typically function as black-box models, offering limited transparency and
minimal support for human reasoning. This lack of interpretability hinders
their usability in real-world decision-making contexts, especially for
non-expert users. In this paper, we present DF-P2E (Deepfake: Prediction to
Explanation), a novel multimodal framework that integrates visual, semantic,
and narrative layers of explanation to make deepfake detection interpretable
and accessible. The framework consists of three modular components: (1) a
deepfake classifier with Grad-CAM-based saliency visualisation, (2) a visual
captioning module that generates natural language summaries of manipulated
regions, and (3) a narrative refinement module that uses a fine-tuned Large
Language Model (LLM) to produce context-aware, user-sensitive explanations. We
instantiate and evaluate the framework on the DF40 benchmark, the most diverse
deepfake dataset to date. Experiments demonstrate that our system achieves
competitive detection performance while providing high-quality explanations
aligned with Grad-CAM activations. By unifying prediction and explanation in a
coherent, human-aligned pipeline, this work offers a scalable approach to
interpretable deepfake detection, advancing the broader vision of trustworthy
and transparent AI systems in adversarial media environments.

Method: 结合双镜头生成和循环视频技术，实现角色一致性和空间连续性，支持长对话生成。

Conclusion: ShoulderShot为实际对话视频生成提供了新可能性。

Abstract: Over-the-shoulder dialogue videos are essential in films, short dramas, and
advertisements, providing visual variety and enhancing viewers' emotional
connection. Despite their importance, such dialogue scenes remain largely
underexplored in video generation research. The main challenges include
maintaining character consistency across different shots, creating a sense of
spatial continuity, and generating long, multi-turn dialogues within limited
computational budgets. Here, we present ShoulderShot, a framework that combines
dual-shot generation with looping video, enabling extended dialogues while
preserving character consistency. Our results demonstrate capabilities that
surpass existing methods in terms of shot-reverse-shot layout, spatial
continuity, and flexibility in dialogue length, thereby opening up new
possibilities for practical dialogue video generation. Videos and comparisons

Result: LaVieID能够生成高保真个性化视频，并达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: LaVieID通过局部和时间的优化，显著提升了身份保持视频生成的效果。

Abstract: In this paper, we present LaVieID, a novel \underline{l}ocal
\underline{a}utoregressive \underline{vi}d\underline{e}o diffusion framework
designed to tackle the challenging \underline{id}entity-preserving
text-to-video task. The key idea of LaVieID is to mitigate the loss of identity
information inherent in the stochastic global generation process of diffusion
transformers (DiTs) from both spatial and temporal perspectives. Specifically,
unlike the global and unstructured modeling of facial latent states in existing
DiTs, LaVieID introduces a local router to explicitly represent latent states
by weighted combinations of fine-grained local facial structures. This
alleviates undesirable feature interference and encourages DiTs to capture
distinctive facial characteristics. Furthermore, a temporal autoregressive
module is integrated into LaVieID to refine denoised latent tokens before video
decoding. This module divides latent tokens temporally into chunks, exploiting
their long-range temporal dependencies to predict biases for rectifying tokens,
thereby significantly enhancing inter-frame identity consistency. Consequently,
LaVieID can generate high-fidelity personalized videos and achieve
state-of-the-art performance. Our code and models are available at

Conclusion: X2Edit数据集和训练方法显著提升了图像编辑任务的性能，填补了领域空白。

Abstract: Existing open-source datasets for arbitrary-instruction image editing remain
suboptimal, while a plug-and-play editing module compatible with
community-prevalent generative models is notably absent. In this paper, we
first introduce the X2Edit Dataset, a comprehensive dataset covering 14 diverse
editing tasks, including subject-driven generation. We utilize the
industry-leading unified image generation models and expert models to construct
the data. Meanwhile, we design reasonable editing instructions with the VLM and
implement various scoring mechanisms to filter the data. As a result, we
construct 3.7 million high-quality data with balanced categories. Second, to
better integrate seamlessly with community image generation models, we design
task-aware MoE-LoRA training based on FLUX.1, with only 8\% of the parameters
of the full model. To further improve the final performance, we utilize the
internal representations of the diffusion model and define positive/negative
samples based on image editing types to introduce contrastive learning.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the model's editing performance is
competitive among many excellent models. Additionally, the constructed dataset
exhibits substantial advantages over existing open-source datasets. The

TL;DR: 提出一种两阶段方法，通过隐式神经表示（INR）生成先验图像并校正投影数据，以减少牙科CBCT中的截断伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型探测器导致视野截断，影响迭代重建图像质量。

Method: 第一阶段用INR生成先验图像并校正投影数据；第二阶段用校正后的数据进行迭代重建。

Result: 两阶段方法有效抑制截断伪影，提升图像质量。

Conclusion: 该方法为牙科CBCT中的截断问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In dental cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), compact and cost-effective
system designs often use small detectors, resulting in a truncated field of
view (FOV) that does not fully encompass the patient's head. In iterative
reconstruction approaches, the discrepancy between the actual projection and
the forward projection within the truncated FOV accumulates over iterations,
leading to significant degradation in the reconstructed image quality. In this
study, we propose a two-stage approach to mitigate truncation artifacts in
dental CBCT. In the first stage, we employ Implicit Neural Representation
(INR), leveraging its superior representation power, to generate a prior image
over an extended region so that its forward projection fully covers the
patient's head. To reduce computational and memory burdens, INR reconstruction
is performed with a coarse voxel size. The forward projection of this prior
image is then used to estimate the discrepancy due to truncated FOV in the
measured projection data. In the second stage, the discrepancy-corrected
projection data is utilized in a conventional iterative reconstruction process
within the truncated region. Our numerical results demonstrate that the
proposed two-grid approach effectively suppresses truncation artifacts, leading
to improved CBCT image quality.

Result: SOFA能准确合成消融后图像，优化方案使模型预测的复发风险降低22.18%。

Conclusion: SOFA首次整合了手术效果模拟、复发预测和参数优化，为个性化房颤消融提供了新工具。

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a prevalent cardiac arrhythmia often treated with
catheter ablation procedures, but procedural outcomes are highly variable.
Evaluating and improving ablation efficacy is challenging due to the complex
interaction between patient-specific tissue and procedural factors. This paper
asks two questions: Can AF recurrence be predicted by simulating the effects of
procedural parameters? How should we ablate to reduce AF recurrence? We propose
SOFA (Simulating and Optimizing Atrial Fibrillation Ablation), a novel
deep-learning framework that addresses these questions. SOFA first simulates
the outcome of an ablation strategy by generating a post-ablation image
depicting scar formation, conditioned on a patient's pre-ablation LGE-MRI and
the specific procedural parameters used (e.g., ablation locations, duration,
temperature, power, and force). During this simulation, it predicts AF
recurrence risk. Critically, SOFA then introduces an optimization scheme that
refines these procedural parameters to minimize the predicted risk. Our method
leverages a multi-modal, multi-view generator that processes 2.5D
representations of the atrium. Quantitative evaluations show that SOFA
accurately synthesizes post-ablation images and that our optimization scheme
leads to a 22.18\% reduction in the model-predicted recurrence risk. To the
best of our knowledge, SOFA is the first framework to integrate the simulation
of procedural effects, recurrence prediction, and parameter optimization,
offering a novel tool for personalizing AF ablation.

Motivation: 现有目标检测模型未能充分利用静态环境中物体空间布局的一致性，导致检测结果不一致或错误。

Method: 使用图神经网络（GNN）建模物体间的空间关系，修正异常检测结果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法可将mAP@50提升高达4%。

Conclusion: 通过利用环境的空间结构，可显著提高目标检测系统的可靠性。

Abstract: In many real-world applications involving static environments, the spatial
layout of objects remains consistent across instances. However,
state-of-the-art object detection models often fail to leverage this spatial
prior, resulting in inconsistent predictions, missed detections, or
misclassifications, particularly in cluttered or occluded scenes. In this work,
we propose a graph-based post-processing pipeline that explicitly models the
spatial relationships between objects to correct detection anomalies in
egocentric frames. Using a graph neural network (GNN) trained on manually
annotated data, our model identifies invalid object class labels and predicts
corrected class labels based on their neighbourhood context. We evaluate our
approach both as a standalone anomaly detection and correction framework and as
a post-processing module for standard object detectors such as YOLOv7 and
RT-DETR. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating this spatial reasoning
significantly improves detection performance, with mAP@50 gains of up to 4%.
This method highlights the potential of leveraging the environment's spatial
structure to improve reliability in object detection systems.

Abstract: Existing emotion recognition methods mainly focus on enhancing performance by
employing complex deep models, typically resulting in significantly higher
model complexity. Although effective, it is also crucial to ensure the
reliability of the final decision, especially for noisy, corrupted and
out-of-distribution data. To this end, we propose a novel emotion recognition
method called trusted emotion recognition (TER), which utilizes uncertainty
estimation to calculate the confidence value of predictions. TER combines the
results from multiple modalities based on their confidence values to output the
trusted predictions. We also provide a new evaluation criterion to assess the
reliability of predictions. Specifically, we incorporate trusted precision and
trusted recall to determine the trusted threshold and formulate the trusted
Acc. and trusted F1 score to evaluate the model's trusted performance. The
proposed framework combines the confidence module that accordingly endows the
model with reliability and robustness against possible noise or corruption. The
extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed
model. The TER achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Music-video,
achieving 82.40% Acc. In terms of trusted performance, TER outperforms other
methods on the IEMOCAP and Music-video, achieving trusted F1 scores of 0.7511

Conclusion: 显式模仿人类动作能有效提升视觉机器人操作的性能，尤其在数据稀缺时。

Abstract: Visual Robot Manipulation (VRM) aims to enable a robot to follow natural
language instructions based on robot states and visual observations, and
therefore requires costly multi-modal data. To compensate for the deficiency of
robot data, existing approaches have employed vision-language pretraining with
large-scale data. However, they either utilize web data that differs from
robotic tasks, or train the model in an implicit way (e.g., predicting future
frames at the pixel level), thus showing limited generalization ability under
insufficient robot data. In this paper, we propose to learn from large-scale
human action video datasets in an explicit way (i.e., imitating human actions
from hand keypoints), introducing Visual Robot Manipulation with Analogical
Reasoning (AR-VRM). To acquire action knowledge explicitly from human action
videos, we propose a keypoint Vision-Language Model (VLM) pretraining scheme,
enabling the VLM to learn human action knowledge and directly predict human
hand keypoints. During fine-tuning on robot data, to facilitate the robotic arm
in imitating the action patterns of human motions, we first retrieve human
action videos that perform similar manipulation tasks and have similar
historical observations , and then learn the Analogical Reasoning (AR) map
between human hand keypoints and robot components. Taking advantage of focusing
on action keypoints instead of irrelevant visual cues, our method achieves
leading performance on the CALVIN benchmark {and real-world experiments}. In
few-shot scenarios, our AR-VRM outperforms previous methods by large margins ,
underscoring the effectiveness of explicitly imitating human actions under data
scarcity.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖提示或布局控制遮挡，但缺乏精确性。

Method: 利用预训练扩散模型和体积渲染原理，在潜在空间中根据遮挡关系和透射率渲染场景。

Result: 在遮挡准确性上显著优于现有方法，并能调整物体透明度等效果。

Conclusion: 该方法无需重新训练模型，实现了基于物理的精确遮挡控制。

Abstract: We propose a novel training-free image generation algorithm that precisely
controls the occlusion relationships between objects in an image. Existing
image generation methods typically rely on prompts to influence occlusion,
which often lack precision. While layout-to-image methods provide control over
object locations, they fail to address occlusion relationships explicitly.
Given a pre-trained image diffusion model, our method leverages volume
rendering principles to "render" the scene in latent space, guided by occlusion
relationships and the estimated transmittance of objects. This approach does
not require retraining or fine-tuning the image diffusion model, yet it enables
accurate occlusion control due to its physics-grounded foundation. In extensive
experiments, our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms
of occlusion accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by adjusting the
opacities of objects or concepts during rendering, our method can achieve a
variety of effects, such as altering the transparency of objects, the density
of mass (e.g., forests), the concentration of particles (e.g., rain, fog), the
intensity of light, and the strength of lens effects, etc.

Result: 在MSTAR数据集上的实验表明，该方法在不同噪声条件下均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: CLSDF方法有效提升了SAR ATR在噪声标签下的鲁棒性和识别性能。

Abstract: The acquisition of high-quality labeled synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data
is challenging due to the demanding requirement for expert knowledge.
Consequently, the presence of unreliable noisy labels is unavoidable, which
results in performance degradation of SAR automatic target recognition (ATR).
Existing research on learning with noisy labels mainly focuses on image data.
However, the non-intuitive visual characteristics of SAR data are insufficient
to achieve noise-robust learning. To address this problem, we propose
collaborative learning of scattering and deep features (CLSDF) for SAR ATR with
noisy labels. Specifically, a multi-model feature fusion framework is designed
to integrate scattering and deep features. The attributed scattering centers
(ASCs) are treated as dynamic graph structure data, and the extracted physical
characteristics effectively enrich the representation of deep image features.
Then, the samples with clean and noisy labels are divided by modeling the loss
distribution with multiple class-wise Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs).
Afterward, the semi-supervised learning of two divergent branches is conducted
based on the data divided by each other. Moreover, a joint distribution
alignment strategy is introduced to enhance the reliability of co-guessed
labels. Extensive experiments have been done on the Moving and Stationary
Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) dataset, and the results show that
the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance under different
operating conditions with various label noises.

TL;DR: UR-VTON提出了一种无需训练的新框架，通过“脱衣-穿衣”机制解决长袖转短袖虚拟试衣中的皮肤恢复问题，结合动态指导和结构细化器提升效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试衣方法在长袖转短袖场景中因皮肤恢复不准确导致效果不真实，UR-VTON旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用“脱衣-穿衣”机制分解任务，结合动态分类器自由指导和结构细化器优化细节。

Result: UR-VTON在细节保留和图像质量上优于现有方法，并提出了新基准LS-TON。

Conclusion: UR-VTON为长袖转短袖虚拟试衣提供了高效解决方案，可无缝集成现有方法。

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VTON) is a crucial task for enhancing user experience in
online shopping by generating realistic garment previews on personal photos.
Although existing methods have achieved impressive results, they struggle with
long-sleeve-to-short-sleeve conversions-a common and practical scenario-often
producing unrealistic outputs when exposed skin is underrepresented in the
original image. We argue that this challenge arises from the ''majority''
completion rule in current VTON models, which leads to inaccurate skin
restoration in such cases. To address this, we propose UR-VTON (Undress-Redress
Virtual Try-ON), a novel, training-free framework that can be seamlessly
integrated with any existing VTON method. UR-VTON introduces an
''undress-to-redress'' mechanism: it first reveals the user's torso by
virtually ''undressing,'' then applies the target short-sleeve garment,
effectively decomposing the conversion into two more manageable steps.
Additionally, we incorporate Dynamic Classifier-Free Guidance scheduling to
balance diversity and image quality during DDPM sampling, and employ Structural
Refiner to enhance detail fidelity using high-frequency cues. Finally, we
present LS-TON, a new benchmark for long-sleeve-to-short-sleeve try-on.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that UR-VTON outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in both detail preservation and image quality. Code will be released
upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 论文提出TAR-TVG框架，通过时间戳锚点约束推理过程，提升视频片段定位的准确性，并采用自蒸馏训练策略优化模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法未能显式约束推理过程，影响最终时间预测质量。

Method: 引入时间戳锚点作为中间验证点，要求推理步骤逐步精确化；采用三阶段自蒸馏训练策略（GRPO训练、监督微调、GRPO优化）。

Result: 模型在实验中表现最优，生成可解释、可验证的推理链，并逐步细化时间估计。

Conclusion: TAR-TVG框架通过显式监督和自蒸馏策略，显著提升了视频片段定位的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Temporal Video Grounding (TVG) aims to precisely localize video segments
corresponding to natural language queries, which is a critical capability for
long-form video understanding. Although existing reinforcement learning
approaches encourage models to generate reasoning chains before predictions,
they fail to explicitly constrain the reasoning process to ensure the quality
of the final temporal predictions. To address this limitation, we propose
Timestamp Anchor-constrained Reasoning for Temporal Video Grounding (TAR-TVG),
a novel framework that introduces timestamp anchors within the reasoning
process to enforce explicit supervision to the thought content. These anchors
serve as intermediate verification points. More importantly, we require each
reasoning step to produce increasingly accurate temporal estimations, thereby
ensuring that the reasoning process contributes meaningfully to the final
prediction. To address the challenge of low-probability anchor generation in
models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-3B), we develop an efficient self-distillation
training strategy: (1) initial GRPO training to collect 30K high-quality
reasoning traces containing multiple timestamp anchors, (2) supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on distilled data, and (3) final GRPO optimization on the
SFT-enhanced model. This three-stage training strategy enables robust anchor
generation while maintaining reasoning quality. Experiments show that our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance while producing interpretable, verifiable
reasoning chains with progressively refined temporal estimations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户对个性化3D内容的需求增加，但现有编辑工具多为2D领域，直接应用于3D生成会导致信息丢失和质量下降。

Method: 采用几何保留模块和注入切换器，利用原始法线潜在空间指导多视图生成，控制监督程度以确保编辑色彩与法线视图对齐。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了编辑后3D资产的多视图一致性和网格质量。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D内容编辑提供了一种高效且高质量的解决方案，适用于多种多视图扩散模型和编辑方法的组合。

Abstract: As 3D generation techniques continue to flourish, the demand for generating
personalized content is rapidly rising. Users increasingly seek to apply
various editing methods to polish generated 3D content, aiming to enhance its
color, style, and lighting without compromising the underlying geometry.
However, most existing editing tools focus on the 2D domain, and directly
feeding their results into 3D generation methods (like multi-view diffusion
models) will introduce information loss, degrading the quality of the final 3D
assets. In this paper, we propose a tuning-free, plug-and-play scheme that
aligns edited assets with their original geometry in a single inference run.
Central to our approach is a geometry preservation module that guides the
edited multi-view generation with original input normal latents. Besides, an
injection switcher is proposed to deliberately control the supervision extent
of the original normals, ensuring the alignment between the edited color and
normal views. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently improves
both the multi-view consistency and mesh quality of edited 3D assets, across
multiple combinations of multi-view diffusion models and editing methods.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在定量和定性评估中优于基线，显著提升了3DGS的表面重建能力。

Conclusion: 多视角约束有效解决了3DGS的几何偏差问题，提升了重建精度。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves remarkable results in the field of
surface reconstruction. However, when Gaussian normal vectors are aligned
within the single-view projection plane, while the geometry appears reasonable
in the current view, biases may emerge upon switching to nearby views. To
address the distance and global matching challenges in multi-view scenes, we
design multi-view normal and distance-guided Gaussian splatting. This method
achieves geometric depth unification and high-accuracy reconstruction by
constraining nearby depth maps and aligning 3D normals. Specifically, for the
reconstruction of small indoor and outdoor scenes, we propose a multi-view
distance reprojection regularization module that achieves multi-view Gaussian
alignment by computing the distance loss between two nearby views and the same
Gaussian surface. Additionally, we develop a multi-view normal enhancement
module, which ensures consistency across views by matching the normals of pixel
points in nearby views and calculating the loss. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline in both quantitative and
qualitative evaluations, significantly enhancing the surface reconstruction
capability of 3DGS.

Abstract: Accurate detection and classification of diverse door types in floor plans
drawings is critical for multiple applications, such as building compliance
checking, and indoor scene understanding. Despite their importance, publicly
available datasets specifically designed for fine-grained multi-class door
detection remain scarce. In this work, we present a semi-automated pipeline
that leverages a state-of-the-art object detector and a large language model
(LLM) to construct a multi-class door detection dataset with minimal manual
effort. Doors are first detected as a unified category using a deep object
detection model. Next, an LLM classifies each detected instance based on its
visual and contextual features. Finally, a human-in-the-loop stage ensures
high-quality labels and bounding boxes. Our method significantly reduces
annotation cost while producing a dataset suitable for benchmarking neural
models in floor plan analysis. This work demonstrates the potential of
combining deep learning and multimodal reasoning for efficient dataset
construction in complex real-world domains.

Method: 提出TriReWeight方法，基于三重连接的样本重加权，理论分析三种生成图像的监督方式。

Result: 实验证明TriReWeight在六种自然图像数据集上平均提升7.9%，三种医学数据集上提升3.4%。

Conclusion: TriReWeight可集成于任何生成数据增强方法，理论性能接近最优，实验验证其有效性。

Abstract: The performance of computer vision models in certain real-world applications,
such as medical diagnosis, is often limited by the scarcity of available
images. Expanding datasets using pre-trained generative models is an effective
solution. However, due to the uncontrollable generation process and the
ambiguity of natural language, noisy images may be generated. Re-weighting is
an effective way to address this issue by assigning low weights to such noisy
images. We first theoretically analyze three types of supervision for the
generated images. Based on the theoretical analysis, we develop TriReWeight, a
triplet-connection-based sample re-weighting method to enhance generative data
augmentation. Theoretically, TriReWeight can be integrated with any generative
data augmentation methods and never downgrade their performance. Moreover, its
generalization approaches the optimal in the order $O(\sqrt{d\ln (n)/n})$. Our
experiments validate the correctness of the theoretical analysis and
demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing SOTA methods by $7.9\%$ on
average over six natural image datasets and by $3.4\%$ on average over three
medical datasets. We also experimentally validate that our method can enhance
the performance of different generative data augmentation methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Grouped Speculative Decoding (GSD)的无训练加速方法，显著提升了自回归图像模型的推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归图像模型虽然生成能力强，但推理速度慢，限制了实际应用。

Method: 通过动态聚类评估视觉有效令牌群，而非单一目标令牌，以减少误拒。

Result: 实验表明，GSD平均加速3.7倍，且不损失图像质量。

Conclusion: GSD是一种高效且无需额外训练的自回归图像模型加速方法。

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive (AR) image models have demonstrated remarkable
generative capabilities, positioning themselves as a compelling alternative to
diffusion models. However, their sequential nature leads to long inference
times, limiting their practical scalability. In this work, we introduce Grouped
Speculative Decoding (GSD), a novel, training-free acceleration method for AR
image models. While recent studies have explored Speculative Decoding (SD) as a
means to speed up AR image generation, existing approaches either provide only
modest acceleration or require additional training. Our in-depth analysis
reveals a fundamental difference between language and image tokens: image
tokens exhibit inherent redundancy and diversity, meaning multiple tokens can
convey valid semantics. However, traditional SD methods are designed to accept
only a single most-likely token, which fails to leverage this difference,
leading to excessive false-negative rejections. To address this, we propose a
new SD strategy that evaluates clusters of visually valid tokens rather than
relying on a single target token. Additionally, we observe that static
clustering based on embedding distance is ineffective, which motivates our
dynamic GSD approach. Extensive experiments show that GSD accelerates AR image
models by an average of 3.7x while preserving image quality-all without
requiring any additional training. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖人工提供的额外指导（如文本提示或空间掩码），可能导致辅助特征分离不彻底，影响生成质量。

Method: 通过对比学习训练目标标记和图像辅助文本标记，提取解耦的真实语义，并应用解耦交叉注意力微调以避免过拟合。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在概念表示和编辑方面均优于现有技术，实现了平衡的高性能。

Conclusion: Contrastive Inversion 是一种高效且无需额外指导的方法，显著提升了图像生成的质量和灵活性。

Abstract: The recent demand for customized image generation raises a need for
techniques that effectively extract the common concept from small sets of
images. Existing methods typically rely on additional guidance, such as text
prompts or spatial masks, to capture the common target concept. Unfortunately,
relying on manually provided guidance can lead to incomplete separation of
auxiliary features, which degrades generation quality.In this paper, we propose
Contrastive Inversion, a novel approach that identifies the common concept by
comparing the input images without relying on additional information. We train
the target token along with the image-wise auxiliary text tokens via
contrastive learning, which extracts the well-disentangled true semantics of
the target. Then we apply disentangled cross-attention fine-tuning to improve
concept fidelity without overfitting. Experimental results and analysis
demonstrate that our method achieves a balanced, high-level performance in both
concept representation and editing, outperforming existing techniques.

Motivation: 现有参考分割方法依赖元学习，数据与计算成本高，需轻量级解决方案。

Result: 在广泛使用的数据集上，分割性能提升超过5%。

Conclusion: CAV-SAM为轻量级适应下游任务提供了高效方案。

Abstract: Large vision models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibit significant
limitations when applied to downstream tasks in the wild. Consequently,
reference segmentation, which leverages reference images and their
corresponding masks to impart novel knowledge to the model, emerges as a
promising new direction for adapting vision models. However, existing reference
segmentation approaches predominantly rely on meta-learning, which still
necessitates an extensive meta-training process and brings massive data and
computational cost. In this study, we propose a novel approach by representing
the inherent correspondence between reference-target image pairs as a pseudo
video. This perspective allows the latest version of SAM, known as SAM2, which
is equipped with interactive video object segmentation (iVOS) capabilities, to
be adapted to downstream tasks in a lightweight manner. We term this approach
Correspondence As Video for SAM (CAV-SAM). CAV-SAM comprises two key modules:
the Diffusion-Based Semantic Transition (DBST) module employs a diffusion model
to construct a semantic transformation sequence, while the Test-Time Geometric
Alignment (TTGA) module aligns the geometric changes within this sequence
through test-time fine-tuning. We evaluated CAVSAM on widely-used datasets,
achieving segmentation performance improvements exceeding 5% over SOTA methods.
Implementation is provided in the supplementary materials.

Result: 实验表明，UniSVG显著提升开源MLLMs在SVG任务中的性能，超越GPT-4V等闭源模型。

Conclusion: UniSVG为SVG理解与生成提供了首个综合性数据集，推动了多模态模型在该领域的发展。

Abstract: Unlike bitmap images, scalable vector graphics (SVG) maintain quality when
scaled, frequently employed in computer vision and artistic design in the
representation of SVG code. In this era of proliferating AI-powered systems,
enabling AI to understand and generate SVG has become increasingly urgent.
However, AI-driven SVG understanding and generation (U&G) remain significant
challenges. SVG code, equivalent to a set of curves and lines controlled by
floating-point parameters, demands high precision in SVG U&G. Besides, SVG
generation operates under diverse conditional constraints, including textual
prompts and visual references, which requires powerful multi-modal processing
for condition-to-SVG transformation. Recently, the rapid growth of Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated capabilities to process
multi-modal inputs and generate complex vector controlling parameters,
suggesting the potential to address SVG U&G tasks within a unified model. To
unlock MLLM's capabilities in the SVG area, we propose an SVG-centric dataset
called UniSVG, comprising 525k data items, tailored for MLLM training and
evaluation. To our best knowledge, it is the first comprehensive dataset
designed for unified SVG generation (from textual prompts and images) and SVG
understanding (color, category, usage, etc.). As expected, learning on the
proposed dataset boosts open-source MLLMs' performance on various SVG U&G
tasks, surpassing SOTA close-source MLLMs like GPT-4V. We release dataset,

Motivation: 当前方法在保持视角一致性和处理复杂场景动态时存在困难，特别是在大规模多元素交互环境中。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：首先通过少样本学习从单张图像预测最优相机轨迹，然后通过姿态条件扩散过程生成几何一致的多视角序列，最终转换为持久4D表示。

Result: Dream4D在4D生成质量（如mPSNR、mSSIM）上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架首次结合了视频扩散模型的时间先验和重建模型的几何感知，显著提升了4D内容合成的效果。

Abstract: The synthesis of spatiotemporally coherent 4D content presents fundamental
challenges in computer vision, requiring simultaneous modeling of high-fidelity
spatial representations and physically plausible temporal dynamics. Current
approaches often struggle to maintain view consistency while handling complex
scene dynamics, particularly in large-scale environments with multiple
interacting elements. This work introduces Dream4D, a novel framework that
bridges this gap through a synergy of controllable video generation and neural
4D reconstruction. Our approach seamlessly combines a two-stage architecture:
it first predicts optimal camera trajectories from a single image using
few-shot learning, then generates geometrically consistent multi-view sequences
via a specialized pose-conditioned diffusion process, which are finally
converted into a persistent 4D representation. This framework is the first to
leverage both rich temporal priors from video diffusion models and geometric
awareness of the reconstruction models, which significantly facilitates 4D
generation and shows higher quality (e.g., mPSNR, mSSIM) over existing methods.

Motivation: 嵌入方法在零样本学习中通过视觉-语义映射传递知识，但手动定义的原型可能引入噪声监督，包括实例级不匹配和类级不精确性。

Method: CLZSL框架包含PCL模块（通过课程学习优先处理高相似样本）和PUP模块（动态更新原型）。

Result: 在AWA2、SUN和CUB数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: CLZSL通过减少噪声监督提升了视觉-语义映射的准确性，改进了零样本学习性能。

Abstract: In Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL), embedding-based methods enable knowledge
transfer from seen to unseen classes by learning a visual-semantic mapping from
seen-class images to class-level semantic prototypes (e.g., attributes).
However, these semantic prototypes are manually defined and may introduce noisy
supervision for two main reasons: (i) instance-level mismatch: variations in
perspective, occlusion, and annotation bias will cause discrepancies between
individual sample and the class-level semantic prototypes; and (ii) class-level
imprecision: the manually defined semantic prototypes may not accurately
reflect the true semantics of the class. Consequently, the visual-semantic
mapping will be misled, reducing the effectiveness of knowledge transfer to
unseen classes. In this work, we propose a prototype-guided curriculum learning
framework (dubbed as CLZSL), which mitigates instance-level mismatches through
a Prototype-Guided Curriculum Learning (PCL) module and addresses class-level
imprecision via a Prototype Update (PUP) module. Specifically, the PCL module
prioritizes samples with high cosine similarity between their visual mappings
and the class-level semantic prototypes, and progressively advances to
less-aligned samples, thereby reducing the interference of instance-level
mismatches to achieve accurate visual-semantic mapping. Besides, the PUP module
dynamically updates the class-level semantic prototypes by leveraging the
visual mappings learned from instances, thereby reducing class-level
imprecision and further improving the visual-semantic mapping. Experiments were
conducted on standard benchmark datasets-AWA2, SUN, and CUB-to verify the
effectiveness of our method.

Result: 模型在仿真和实际场景中表现出鲁棒的外推能力，适用于复杂非惯性系统，并能处理未知物理参数。

Conclusion: 该方法为SO(3)外推提供了一种通用且鲁棒的解决方案，适用于实际复杂场景。

Abstract: Modeling the rotation of moving objects is a fundamental task in computer
vision, yet $SO(3)$ extrapolation still presents numerous challenges: (1)
unknown quantities such as the moment of inertia complicate dynamics, (2) the
presence of external forces and torques can lead to non-conservative
kinematics, and (3) estimating evolving state trajectories under sparse, noisy
observations requires robustness. We propose modeling trajectories of noisy
pose estimates on the manifold of 3D rotations in a physically and
geometrically meaningful way by leveraging Neural Controlled Differential
Equations guided with $SO(3)$ Savitzky-Golay paths. Existing extrapolation
methods often rely on energy conservation or constant velocity assumptions,
limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios involving non-conservative
forces. In contrast, our approach is agnostic to energy and momentum
conservation while being robust to input noise, making it applicable to
complex, non-inertial systems. Our approach is easily integrated as a module in
existing pipelines and generalizes well to trajectories with unknown physical
parameters. By learning to approximate object dynamics from noisy states during
training, our model attains robust extrapolation capabilities in simulation and
various real-world settings. Code is available at

Conclusion: 片段化方法为步态识别提供了新视角，展示了多尺度时间上下文的重要性，并验证了其潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in gait recognition have significantly enhanced
performance by treating silhouettes as either an unordered set or an ordered
sequence. However, both set-based and sequence-based approaches exhibit notable
limitations. Specifically, set-based methods tend to overlook short-range
temporal context for individual frames, while sequence-based methods struggle
to capture long-range temporal dependencies effectively. To address these
challenges, we draw inspiration from human identification and propose a new
perspective that conceptualizes human gait as a composition of individualized
actions. Each action is represented by a series of frames, randomly selected
from a continuous segment of the sequence, which we term a snippet.
Fundamentally, the collection of snippets for a given sequence enables the
incorporation of multi-scale temporal context, facilitating more comprehensive
gait feature learning. Moreover, we introduce a non-trivial solution for
snippet-based gait recognition, focusing on Snippet Sampling and Snippet
Modeling as key components. Extensive experiments on four widely-used gait
datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach and, more
importantly, highlight the potential of gait snippets. For instance, our method
achieves the rank-1 accuracy of 77.5% on Gait3D and 81.7% on GREW using a 2D
convolution-based backbone.

Motivation: 现有主动防御策略缺乏持久性，攻击者可通过重新训练模型绕过防御，限制了实际应用。

Method: 设计了强度分离机制的双阶段防御框架（TSDF），利用双重功能对抗扰动直接扭曲伪造结果并破坏攻击者的数据准备过程。

Result: 实验表明，TSDF具有强大的双重防御能力，显著提升了防御的持久性。

Conclusion: TSDF通过阻止攻击者模型适应防御扰动，实现了长期有效的防御。

Abstract: Active defense strategies have been developed to counter the threat of
deepfake technology. However, a primary challenge is their lack of persistence,
as their effectiveness is often short-lived. Attackers can bypass these
defenses by simply collecting protected samples and retraining their models.
This means that static defenses inevitably fail when attackers retrain their
models, which severely limits practical use. We argue that an effective defense
not only distorts forged content but also blocks the model's ability to adapt,
which occurs when attackers retrain their models on protected images. To
achieve this, we propose an innovative Two-Stage Defense Framework (TSDF).
Benefiting from the intensity separation mechanism designed in this paper, the
framework uses dual-function adversarial perturbations to perform two roles.
First, it can directly distort the forged results. Second, it acts as a
poisoning vehicle that disrupts the data preparation process essential for an
attacker's retraining pipeline. By poisoning the data source, TSDF aims to
prevent the attacker's model from adapting to the defensive perturbations, thus
ensuring the defense remains effective long-term. Comprehensive experiments
show that the performance of traditional interruption methods degrades sharply
when it is subjected to adversarial retraining. However, our framework shows a
strong dual defense capability, which can improve the persistence of active
defense. Our code will be available at https://github.com/vpsg-research/TSDF.

Conclusion: PBD5K和MDCNeXt为电力电池检测提供了高效解决方案，推动了该领域的研究。

Abstract: Power batteries are essential components in electric vehicles, where internal
structural defects can pose serious safety risks. We conduct a comprehensive
study on a new task, power battery detection (PBD), which aims to localize the
dense endpoints of cathode and anode plates from industrial X-ray images for
quality inspection. Manual inspection is inefficient and error-prone, while
traditional vision algorithms struggle with densely packed plates, low
contrast, scale variation, and imaging artifacts. To address this issue and
drive more attention into this meaningful task, we present PBD5K, the first
large-scale benchmark for this task, consisting of 5,000 X-ray images from nine
battery types with fine-grained annotations and eight types of real-world
visual interference. To support scalable and consistent labeling, we develop an
intelligent annotation pipeline that combines image filtering, model-assisted
pre-labeling, cross-verification, and layered quality evaluation. We formulate
PBD as a point-level segmentation problem and propose MDCNeXt, a model designed
to extract and integrate multi-dimensional structure clues including point,
line, and count information from the plate itself. To improve discrimination
between plates and suppress visual interference, MDCNeXt incorporates two state
space modules. The first is a prompt-filtered module that learns contrastive
relationships guided by task-specific prompts. The second is a density-aware
reordering module that refines segmentation in regions with high plate density.
In addition, we propose a distance-adaptive mask generation strategy to provide
robust supervision under varying spatial distributions of anode and cathode
positions. The source code and datasets will be publicly available at
\href{https://github.com/Xiaoqi-Zhao-DLUT/X-ray-PBD}{PBD5K}.

TL;DR: 本文提出MambaTrans，一种多模态融合图像模态翻译器，旨在解决可见图像与多模态融合图像之间的像素分布差异问题，提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有下游预训练模型通常基于可见图像训练，而多模态融合图像与可见图像的像素分布差异会降低下游任务性能。本文探索如何将多模态融合图像适配于基于可见图像训练的模型。

Method: 提出MambaTrans，利用多模态大语言模型的描述和语义分割模型的掩码作为输入，通过Multi-Model State Space Block结合掩码-图像-文本交叉注意力和3D选择性扫描模块，增强视觉能力。

Result: 实验表明，MambaTrans在不调整预训练模型参数的情况下，有效提升了多模态图像在下游任务中的性能。

Conclusion: MambaTrans通过结合多模态信息和先验知识，成功解决了多模态融合图像与可见图像之间的适配问题，显著提升了下游任务表现。

Abstract: The goal of multimodal image fusion is to integrate complementary information
from infrared and visible images, generating multimodal fused images for
downstream tasks. Existing downstream pre-training models are typically trained
on visible images. However, the significant pixel distribution differences
between visible and multimodal fusion images can degrade downstream task
performance, sometimes even below that of using only visible images. This paper
explores adapting multimodal fused images with significant modality differences
to object detection and semantic segmentation models trained on visible images.
To address this, we propose MambaTrans, a novel multimodal fusion image
modality translator. MambaTrans uses descriptions from a multimodal large
language model and masks from semantic segmentation models as input. Its core
component, the Multi-Model State Space Block, combines mask-image-text
cross-attention and a 3D-Selective Scan Module, enhancing pure visual
capabilities. By leveraging object detection prior knowledge, MambaTrans
minimizes detection loss during training and captures long-term dependencies
among text, masks, and images. This enables favorable results in pre-trained
models without adjusting their parameters. Experiments on public datasets show
that MambaTrans effectively improves multimodal image performance in downstream
tasks.

TL;DR: Pose-RFT是一种针对3D人体姿态生成的强化微调框架，通过混合动作强化学习优化语言预测和姿态生成，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于监督目标的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）难以建模3D姿态生成的模糊性和任务对齐需求。

Method: 提出Pose-RFT框架，采用混合动作强化学习（HyGRPO算法）联合优化离散语言预测和连续姿态生成，并引入任务特定奖励函数。

Result: 在多个姿态生成基准测试中，Pose-RFT显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 混合动作强化微调对3D姿态生成有效，Pose-RFT框架为任务提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Generating 3D human poses from multimodal inputs such as images or text
requires models to capture both rich spatial and semantic correspondences.
While pose-specific multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise
in this task, they are typically trained with supervised objectives such as
SMPL parameter regression or token-level prediction, which struggle to model
the inherent ambiguity and achieve task-specific alignment required for
accurate 3D pose generation. To address these limitations, we propose Pose-RFT,
a reinforcement fine-tuning framework tailored for 3D human pose generation in
MLLMs. We formulate the task as a hybrid action reinforcement learning problem
that jointly optimizes discrete language prediction and continuous pose
generation. To this end, we introduce HyGRPO, a hybrid reinforcement learning
algorithm that performs group-wise reward normalization over sampled responses
to guide joint optimization of discrete and continuous actions. Pose-RFT
further incorporates task-specific reward functions to guide optimization
towards spatial alignment in image-to-pose generation and semantic consistency
in text-to-pose generation. Extensive experiments on multiple pose generation
benchmarks demonstrate that Pose-RFT significantly improves performance over
existing pose-specific MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of hybrid action
reinforcement fine-tuning for 3D pose generation.

TL;DR: DiTVR是一种零样本视频修复框架，结合扩散变换器和轨迹感知注意力，通过光流轨迹对齐令牌，提升时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统回归方法生成不真实细节且需大量配对数据，而生成扩散模型难以保证时间一致性。

Method: 采用扩散变换器与轨迹感知注意力，结合光流轨迹对齐令牌，并使用小波引导的流一致性采样器。

Result: 在视频修复基准测试中达到零样本最优性能，时间一致性和细节保留表现优异。

Conclusion: DiTVR通过创新注意力机制和采样器设计，显著提升了视频修复效果。

Abstract: Video restoration aims to reconstruct high quality video sequences from low
quality inputs, addressing tasks such as super resolution, denoising, and
deblurring. Traditional regression based methods often produce unrealistic
details and require extensive paired datasets, while recent generative
diffusion models face challenges in ensuring temporal consistency. We introduce
DiTVR, a zero shot video restoration framework that couples a diffusion
transformer with trajectory aware attention and a wavelet guided, flow
consistent sampler. Unlike prior 3D convolutional or frame wise diffusion
approaches, our attention mechanism aligns tokens along optical flow
trajectories, with particular emphasis on vital layers that exhibit the highest
sensitivity to temporal dynamics. A spatiotemporal neighbour cache dynamically
selects relevant tokens based on motion correspondences across frames. The flow
guided sampler injects data consistency only into low-frequency bands,
preserving high frequency priors while accelerating convergence. DiTVR
establishes a new zero shot state of the art on video restoration benchmarks,
demonstrating superior temporal consistency and detail preservation while
remaining robust to flow noise and occlusions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种半监督的SAR-光学图像匹配方法（S2M2-SAR），通过伪标签和跨模态特征增强模块，减少对标注数据的依赖，性能优于现有半监督方法，接近全监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR-光学图像匹配依赖大量标注数据，但标注耗时且复杂，因此需要减少对标注数据的依赖。

Method: 设计半监督匹配流程，利用伪标签和跨模态特征增强模块，结合有标签和无标签数据训练模型。

Result: S2M2-SAR在基准数据集上表现优于半监督方法，接近全监督方法。

Conclusion: S2M2-SAR高效且实用，减少了对标注数据的依赖，性能优异。

Abstract: Driven by the complementary nature of optical and synthetic aperture radar
(SAR) images, SAR-optical image matching has garnered significant interest.
Most existing SAR-optical image matching methods aim to capture effective
matching features by employing the supervision of pixel-level matched
correspondences within SAR-optical image pairs, which, however, suffers from
time-consuming and complex manual annotation, making it difficult to collect
sufficient labeled SAR-optical image pairs. To handle this, we design a
semi-supervised SAR-optical image matching pipeline that leverages both scarce
labeled and abundant unlabeled image pairs and propose a semi-supervised
multiscale matching for SAR-optical image matching (S2M2-SAR). Specifically, we
pseudo-label those unlabeled SAR-optical image pairs with pseudo ground-truth
similarity heatmaps by combining both deep and shallow level matching results,
and train the matching model by employing labeled and pseudo-labeled similarity
heatmaps. In addition, we introduce a cross-modal feature enhancement module
trained using a cross-modality mutual independence loss, which requires no
ground-truth labels. This unsupervised objective promotes the separation of
modality-shared and modality-specific features by encouraging statistical
independence between them, enabling effective feature disentanglement across
optical and SAR modalities. To evaluate the effectiveness of S2M2-SAR, we
compare it with existing competitors on benchmark datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that S2M2-SAR not only surpasses existing semi-supervised
methods but also achieves performance competitive with fully supervised SOTA
methods, demonstrating its efficiency and practical potential.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在全局表征或区域特征均匀加权方面存在局限性，无法充分捕捉语义显著区域或局部质量变化。

Method: 利用Segment Anything Model动态分割图像，结合多模态大语言模型提取局部特征，并引入区域感知语义注意力机制。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现出竞争性的质量预测性能。

Conclusion: RSFIQA模型通过细粒度区域特征和注意力机制，显著提升了无参考图像质量评估的效果。

Abstract: No-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) aims to simulate the process
of perceiving image quality aligned with subjective human perception. However,
existing NR-IQA methods either focus on global representations that leads to
limited insights into the semantically salient regions or employ a uniform
weighting for region features that weakens the sensitivity to local quality
variations. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained image quality assessment
model, named RSFIQA, which integrates region-level distortion information to
perceive multi-dimensional quality discrepancies. To enhance regional quality
awareness, we first utilize the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to dynamically
partition the input image into non-overlapping semantic regions. For each
region, we teach a powerful Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to extract
descriptive content and perceive multi-dimensional distortions, enabling a
comprehensive understanding of both local semantics and quality degradations.
To effectively leverage this information, we introduce Region-Aware Semantic
Attention (RSA) mechanism, which generates a global attention map by
aggregating fine-grained representations from local regions. In addition,
RSFIQA is backbone-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into various deep
neural network architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness
and effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves competitive quality
prediction performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

Result: 在工业和医学基准测试中表现出更高的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 协同设计框架能有效适应基础模型到密集感知任务。

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face a significant adaptation gap
when applied to Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD), stemming from their lack of
local inductive biases for dense prediction and their reliance on inflexible
feature fusion paradigms. We address these limitations through an Architectural
Co-Design framework that jointly refines feature representation and cross-modal
fusion. Our method integrates a parameter-efficient Convolutional Low-Rank
Adaptation (Conv-LoRA) adapter to inject local inductive biases for
fine-grained representation, and introduces a Dynamic Fusion Gateway (DFG) that
leverages visual context to adaptively modulate text prompts, enabling a
powerful bidirectional fusion. Extensive experiments on diverse industrial and
medical benchmarks demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness, validating
that this synergistic co-design is critical for robustly adapting foundation
models to dense perception tasks.

Result: 通过定量和定性评估，MIMIC在自由文本输出上反演视觉概念，展示了视觉质量和语义准确性。

Conclusion: MIMIC是首个针对VLM视觉概念解释的反演方法。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) encode multimodal inputs over large, complex,
and difficult-to-interpret architectures, which limit transparency and trust.
We propose a Multimodal Inversion for Model Interpretation and
Conceptualization (MIMIC) framework to visualize the internal representations
of VLMs by synthesizing visual concepts corresponding to internal encodings.
MIMIC uses a joint VLM-based inversion and a feature alignment objective to
account for VLM's autoregressive processing. It additionally includes a triplet
of regularizers for spatial alignment, natural image smoothness, and semantic
realism. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate MIMIC by inverting visual
concepts over a range of varying-length free-form VLM output texts. Reported
results include both standard visual quality metrics as well as semantic
text-based metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model
inversion approach addressing visual interpretations of VLM concepts.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了零样本和小样本性能，且在大规模训练时性能接近小样本方法。

Conclusion: 这种无需标注的方法为视觉语言模型在组织病理学任务中的适应提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in histopathology, such as
CONCH and QuiltNet, have demonstrated impressive zero-shot classification
capabilities across various tasks. However, their general-purpose design may
lead to suboptimal performance in specific downstream applications. While
supervised fine-tuning methods address this issue, they require manually
labeled samples for adaptation. This paper investigates annotation-free
adaptation of VLMs through continued pretraining on domain- and task-relevant
image-caption pairs extracted from existing databases. Our experiments on two
VLMs, CONCH and QuiltNet, across three downstream tasks reveal that these pairs
substantially enhance both zero-shot and few-shot performance. Notably, with
larger training sizes, continued pretraining matches the performance of
few-shot methods while eliminating manual labeling. Its effectiveness,
task-agnostic design, and annotation-free workflow make it a promising pathway
for adapting VLMs to new histopathology tasks. Code is available at

Conclusion: CBDES MoE是一种有效的模块化混合专家框架，为自动驾驶领域提供了性能提升的解决方案。

Abstract: Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception systems based on multi-sensor feature fusion
have become a fundamental cornerstone for end-to-end autonomous driving.
However, existing multi-modal BEV methods commonly suffer from limited input
adaptability, constrained modeling capacity, and suboptimal generalization. To
address these challenges, we propose a hierarchically decoupled
Mixture-of-Experts architecture at the functional module level, termed
Computing Brain DEvelopment System Mixture-of-Experts (CBDES MoE). CBDES MoE
integrates multiple structurally heterogeneous expert networks with a
lightweight Self-Attention Router (SAR) gating mechanism, enabling dynamic
expert path selection and sparse, input-aware efficient inference. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first modular Mixture-of-Experts framework
constructed at the functional module granularity within the autonomous driving
domain. Extensive evaluations on the real-world nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that CBDES MoE consistently outperforms fixed single-expert baselines in 3D
object detection. Compared to the strongest single-expert model, CBDES MoE
achieves a 1.6-point increase in mAP and a 4.1-point improvement in NDS,
demonstrating the effectiveness and practical advantages of the proposed
approach.

Conclusion: Deep SWM为太阳耀斑预测提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate, reliable solar flare prediction is crucial for mitigating potential
disruptions to critical infrastructure, while predicting solar flares remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods based on heuristic physical features
often lack representation learning from solar images. On the other hand,
end-to-end learning approaches struggle to model long-range temporal
dependencies in solar images. In this study, we propose Deep Space Weather
Model (Deep SWM), which is based on multiple deep state space models for
handling both ten-channel solar images and long-range spatio-temporal
dependencies. Deep SWM also features a sparse masked autoencoder, a novel
pretraining strategy that employs a two-phase masking approach to preserve
crucial regions such as sunspots while compressing spatial information.
Furthermore, we built FlareBench, a new public benchmark for solar flare
prediction covering a full 11-year solar activity cycle, to validate our
method. Our method outperformed baseline methods and even human expert
performance on standard metrics in terms of performance and reliability. The

Abstract: In this paper, electron microscopy images of microstructures formed on Ge

Abstract: Minimally invasive surgery presents challenges such as dynamic tissue motion

support surgical guidance, improve safety by helping avoid damage to sensitive

tracking by leveraging 2D Tracking Any Point (TAP) networks. Our method
combines two CoTracker models, one for temporal tracking and one for stereo
matching, to estimate 3D motion from stereo endoscopic images. We evaluate the
system using a clinical laparoscopic setup and a robotic arm simulating tissue
motion, with experiments conducted on a synthetic 3D-printed phantom and a
chicken tissue phantom. Tracking on the chicken tissue phantom yielded more
reliable results, with Euclidean distance errors as low as 1.1 mm at a velocity
of 10 mm/s. These findings highlight the potential of TAP-based models for
accurate, markerless 3D tracking in challenging surgical scenarios.

Abstract: Human motion generation has emerged as a critical technology with
transformative potential for real-world applications. However, existing
vision-language-motion models (VLMMs) face significant limitations that hinder
their practical deployment. We identify controllability as a main bottleneck,
manifesting in five key aspects: inadequate response to diverse human commands,
limited pose initialization capabilities, poor performance on long-term
sequences, insufficient handling of unseen scenarios, and lack of fine-grained
control over individual body parts. To overcome these limitations, we present
Being-M0.5, the first real-time, controllable VLMM that achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple motion generation tasks. Our
approach is built upon HuMo100M, the largest and most comprehensive human
motion dataset to date, comprising over 5 million self-collected motion
sequences, 100 million multi-task instructional instances, and detailed
part-level annotations that address a critical gap in existing datasets. We
introduce a novel part-aware residual quantization technique for motion
tokenization that enables precise, granular control over individual body parts
during generation. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates Being-M0.5's
superior performance across diverse motion benchmarks, while comprehensive
efficiency analysis confirms its real-time capabilities. Our contributions
include design insights and detailed computational analysis to guide future
development of practical motion generators. We believe that HuMo100M and
Being-M0.5 represent significant advances that will accelerate the adoption of
motion generation technologies in real-world applications. The project page is

Conclusion: CATP提升了多模态ICL的实用价值，为未来图像-文本交织场景的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Modern large vision-language models (LVLMs) convert each input image into a
large set of tokens, far outnumbering the text tokens. Although this improves
visual perception, it introduces severe image token redundancy. Because image
tokens carry sparse information, many add little to reasoning, yet greatly
increase inference cost. The emerging image token pruning methods tackle this
issue by identifying the most important tokens and discarding the rest. These
methods can raise efficiency with only modest performance loss. However, most
of them only consider single-image tasks and overlook multimodal in-context
learning (ICL), where redundancy is greater and efficiency is more critical.
Redundant tokens weaken the advantage of multimodal ICL for rapid domain
adaptation and cause unstable performance. Applying existing pruning methods in
this setting leads to large accuracy drops, exposing a clear gap and the need
for new techniques. Thus, we propose Contextually Adaptive Token Pruning
(CATP), a training-free pruning method targeted at multimodal ICL. CATP
consists of two stages that perform progressive pruning to fully account for
the complex cross-modal interactions in the input sequence. After removing
77.8\% of the image tokens, CATP produces an average performance gain of 0.6\%
over the vanilla model on four LVLMs and eight benchmarks, exceeding all
baselines remarkably. Meanwhile, it effectively improves efficiency by
achieving an average reduction of 10.78\% in inference latency. CATP enhances
the practical value of multimodal ICL and lays the groundwork for future
progress in interleaved image-text scenarios.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在弱监督功能接地任务中表现优异，代码已开源。

Abstract: Facilitating an entity's interaction with objects requires accurately
identifying parts that afford specific actions. Weakly supervised affordance
grounding (WSAG) seeks to imitate human learning from third-person
demonstrations, where humans intuitively grasp functional parts without needing
pixel-level annotations. To achieve this, grounding is typically learned using
a shared classifier across images from different perspectives, along with
distillation strategies incorporating part discovery process. However, since
affordance-relevant parts are not always easily distinguishable, models
primarily rely on classification, often focusing on common class-specific
patterns that are unrelated to affordance. To address this limitation, we move
beyond isolated part-level learning by introducing selective prototypical and
pixel contrastive objectives that adaptively learn affordance-relevant cues at
both the part and object levels, depending on the granularity of the available
information. Initially, we find the action-associated objects in both
egocentric (object-focused) and exocentric (third-person example) images by
leveraging CLIP. Then, by cross-referencing the discovered objects of
complementary views, we excavate the precise part-level affordance clues in
each perspective. By consistently learning to distinguish affordance-relevant
regions from affordance-irrelevant background context, our approach effectively
shifts activation from irrelevant areas toward meaningful affordance cues.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Codes are

Abstract: Image restoration under adverse weather conditions has been extensively
explored, leading to numerous high-performance methods. In particular, recent
advances in All-in-One approaches have shown impressive results by training on
multi-task image restoration datasets. However, most of these methods rely on
dedicated network modules or parameters for each specific degradation type,
resulting in a significant parameter overhead. Moreover, the relatedness across
different restoration tasks is often overlooked. In light of these issues, we
propose a parameter-efficient All-in-One image restoration framework that
leverages task-aware enhanced prompts to tackle various adverse weather
degradations.Specifically, we adopt a two-stage training paradigm consisting of
a pretraining phase and a prompt-tuning phase to mitigate parameter conflicts
across tasks. We first employ supervised learning to acquire general
restoration knowledge, and then adapt the model to handle specific degradation
via trainable soft prompts. Crucially, we enhance these task-specific prompts
in a task-aware manner. We apply low-rank decomposition to these prompts to
capture both task-general and task-specific characteristics, and impose
contrastive constraints to better align them with the actual inter-task
relatedness. These enhanced prompts not only improve the parameter efficiency
of the restoration model but also enable more accurate task modeling, as
evidenced by t-SNE analysis. Experimental results on different restoration
tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance with
only 2.75M parameters.

Abstract: Computer vision-based technologies significantly enhance surgical automation
by advancing tool tracking, detection, and localization. However, Current
data-driven approaches are data-voracious, requiring large, high-quality
labeled image datasets, which limits their application in surgical data
science. Our Work introduces a novel dynamic Gaussian Splatting technique to
address the data scarcity in surgical image datasets. We propose a dynamic
Gaussian model to represent dynamic surgical scenes, enabling the rendering of
surgical instruments from unseen viewpoints and deformations with real tissue
backgrounds. We utilize a dynamic training adjustment strategy to address
challenges posed by poorly calibrated camera poses from real-world scenarios.
Additionally, we propose a method based on dynamic Gaussians for automatically
generating annotations for our synthetic data. For evaluation, we constructed a
new dataset featuring seven scenes with 14,000 frames of tool and camera motion
and tool jaw articulation, with a background of an ex-vivo porcine model. Using
this dataset, we synthetically replicate the scene deformation from the ground
truth data, allowing direct comparisons of synthetic image quality.
Experimental results illustrate that our method generates photo-realistic
labeled image datasets with the highest values in Peak-Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(29.87). We further evaluate the performance of medical-specific neural
networks trained on real and synthetic images using an unseen real-world image
dataset. Our results show that the performance of models trained on synthetic
images generated by the proposed method outperforms those trained with
state-of-the-art standard data augmentation by 10%, leading to an overall
improvement in model performances by nearly 15%.

Method: 在预训练视频生成模型中引入条件图像分支，通过受限自注意力和条件位置映射实现身份控制，仅需2000对数据进行快速学习。

Result: 仅增加约1%的参数，即可在视频质量和身份保持上优于其他全参数训练方法，并能无缝集成到其他任务中。

Conclusion: Stand-In框架高效、灵活，适用于多种视频生成任务。

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity human videos that match user-specified identities is
important yet challenging in the field of generative AI. Existing methods often
rely on an excessive number of training parameters and lack compatibility with
other AIGC tools. In this paper, we propose Stand-In, a lightweight and
plug-and-play framework for identity preservation in video generation.
Specifically, we introduce a conditional image branch into the pre-trained
video generation model. Identity control is achieved through restricted
self-attentions with conditional position mapping, and can be learned quickly
with only 2000 pairs. Despite incorporating and training just $\sim$1\%
additional parameters, our framework achieves excellent results in video
quality and identity preservation, outperforming other full-parameter training
methods. Moreover, our framework can be seamlessly integrated for other tasks,
such as subject-driven video generation, pose-referenced video generation,
stylization, and face swapping.

Abstract: Handwritten text recognition for historical documents remains challenging due
to handwriting variability, degraded sources, and limited layout-aware
annotations. In this work, we address annotation errors - particularly
hyphenation issues - in the Bullinger correspondence, a large 16th-century
letter collection. We introduce a self-training method based on a CTC alignment
algorithm that matches full transcriptions to text line images using dynamic
programming and model output probabilities trained with the CTC loss. Our
approach improves performance (e.g., by 1.1 percentage points CER with PyLaia)
and increases alignment accuracy. Interestingly, we find that weaker models
yield more accurate alignments, enabling an iterative training strategy. We
release a new manually corrected subset of 100 pages from the Bullinger
dataset, along with our code and benchmarks. Our approach can be applied
iteratively to further improve the CER as well as the alignment quality for
text recognition pipelines. Code and data are available via

Result: 在三个基准数据集上表现优异，展示了强泛化能力和时间一致性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了视频抠图的性能，适用于多样化真实场景。

Abstract: Video matting has traditionally been limited by the lack of high-quality
ground-truth data. Most existing video matting datasets provide only
human-annotated imperfect alpha and foreground annotations, which must be
composited to background images or videos during the training stage. Thus, the
generalization capability of previous methods in real-world scenarios is
typically poor. In this work, we propose to solve the problem from two
perspectives. First, we emphasize the importance of large-scale pre-training by
pursuing diverse synthetic and pseudo-labeled segmentation datasets. We also
develop a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline that can render diverse
human bodies and fine-grained hairs, yielding around 200 video clips with a
3-second duration for fine-tuning. Second, we introduce a novel video matting
approach that can effectively leverage the rich priors from pre-trained video
diffusion models. This architecture offers two key advantages. First, strong
priors play a critical role in bridging the domain gap between synthetic and
real-world scenes. Second, unlike most existing methods that process video
matting frame-by-frame and use an independent decoder to aggregate temporal
information, our model is inherently designed for video, ensuring strong
temporal consistency. We provide a comprehensive quantitative evaluation across
three benchmark datasets, demonstrating our approach's superior performance,
and present comprehensive qualitative results in diverse real-world scenes,
illustrating the strong generalization capability of our method. The code is

Motivation: 现有方法在静态结构长期稳定性和动态运动高保真细节保留之间存在冲突，导致几何漂移或模糊重建。

Method: Mem4D采用双内存架构：瞬态动态内存（TDM）捕捉高频运动细节，持久结构内存（PSM）压缩长期空间信息。

Result: 实验表明，Mem4D在保持高效率的同时，实现了静态几何的全局一致性和动态元素的高保真重建。

Conclusion: Mem4D通过解耦静态和动态建模，显著提升了动态场景重建的性能。

Abstract: Reconstructing dense geometry for dynamic scenes from a monocular video is a
critical yet challenging task. Recent memory-based methods enable efficient
online reconstruction, but they fundamentally suffer from a Memory Demand
Dilemma: The memory representation faces an inherent conflict between the
long-term stability required for static structures and the rapid, high-fidelity
detail retention needed for dynamic motion. This conflict forces existing
methods into a compromise, leading to either geometric drift in static
structures or blurred, inaccurate reconstructions of dynamic objects. To
address this dilemma, we propose Mem4D, a novel framework that decouples the
modeling of static geometry and dynamic motion. Guided by this insight, we
design a dual-memory architecture: 1) The Transient Dynamics Memory (TDM)
focuses on capturing high-frequency motion details from recent frames, enabling
accurate and fine-grained modeling of dynamic content; 2) The Persistent
Structure Memory (PSM) compresses and preserves long-term spatial information,
ensuring global consistency and drift-free reconstruction for static elements.
By alternating queries to these specialized memories, Mem4D simultaneously
maintains static geometry with global consistency and reconstructs dynamic
elements with high fidelity. Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance while
maintaining high efficiency. Codes will be publicly available.

Abstract: Generative AI holds great potentials to automate and enhance data synthesis

Two applications are demonstrated: Pose2Xray, which generates synthetic X-rays

dose maps from 2D SPECT/CT scans. In both cases, our outlier detection (OD)
enhances reliability, reduces manual oversight, and supports real-time quality
control. This approach strengthens the industrial viability of GenAI in
preclinical settings by increasing robustness, scalability, and regulatory
compliance.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) in remote sensing (RS) is pivotal for
interpreting Earth observation data. However, existing RS VQA datasets are
constrained by limitations in annotation richness, question diversity, and the
assessment of specific reasoning capabilities. This paper introduces RSVLM-QA
dataset, a new large-scale, content-rich VQA dataset for the RS domain.
RSVLM-QA is constructed by integrating data from several prominent RS
segmentation and detection datasets: WHU, LoveDA, INRIA, and iSAID. We employ
an innovative dual-track annotation generation pipeline. Firstly, we leverage
Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4.1, with meticulously designed
prompts to automatically generate a suite of detailed annotations including
image captions, spatial relations, and semantic tags, alongside complex
caption-based VQA pairs. Secondly, to address the challenging task of object
counting in RS imagery, we have developed a specialized automated process that
extracts object counts directly from the original segmentation data; GPT-4.1
then formulates natural language answers from these counts, which are paired
with preset question templates to create counting QA pairs. RSVLM-QA comprises
13,820 images and 162,373 VQA pairs, featuring extensive annotations and
diverse question types. We provide a detailed statistical analysis of the
dataset and a comparison with existing RS VQA benchmarks, highlighting the
superior depth and breadth of RSVLM-QA's annotations. Furthermore, we conduct
benchmark experiments on Six mainstream Vision Language Models (VLMs),
demonstrating that RSVLM-QA effectively evaluates and challenges the
understanding and reasoning abilities of current VLMs in the RS domain. We
believe RSVLM-QA will serve as a pivotal resource for the RS VQA and VLM
research communities, poised to catalyze advancements in the field.

Conclusion: 该框架为视觉特效生成提供了高效且灵活的解决方案，推动了多特效复合生成的研究与应用。

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) are essential visual enhancements fundamental to modern
cinematic production. Although video generation models offer cost-efficient
solutions for VFX production, current methods are constrained by per-effect
LoRA training, which limits generation to single effects. This fundamental
limitation impedes applications that require spatially controllable composite
effects, i.e., the concurrent generation of multiple effects at designated
locations. However, integrating diverse effects into a unified framework faces
major challenges: interference from effect variations and spatial
uncontrollability during multi-VFX joint training. To tackle these challenges,
we propose Omni-Effects, a first unified framework capable of generating
prompt-guided effects and spatially controllable composite effects. The core of
our framework comprises two key innovations: (1) LoRA-based Mixture of Experts
(LoRA-MoE), which employs a group of expert LoRAs, integrating diverse effects
within a unified model while effectively mitigating cross-task interference.
(2) Spatial-Aware Prompt (SAP) incorporates spatial mask information into the
text token, enabling precise spatial control. Furthermore, we introduce an
Independent-Information Flow (IIF) module integrated within the SAP, isolating
the control signals corresponding to individual effects to prevent any unwanted
blending. To facilitate this research, we construct a comprehensive VFX dataset
Omni-VFX via a novel data collection pipeline combining image editing and
First-Last Frame-to-Video (FLF2V) synthesis, and introduce a dedicated VFX
evaluation framework for validating model performance. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Omni-Effects achieves precise spatial control and diverse
effect generation, enabling users to specify both the category and location of
desired effects.

Conclusion: TAG是一种简单有效的零样本视频时间定位方法，解决了现有方法的局限性，性能优越。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to extract relevant video segments based
on a given natural language query. Recently, zero-shot VTG methods have gained
attention by leveraging pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) to localize
target moments without additional training. However, existing approaches suffer
from semantic fragmentation, where temporally continuous frames sharing the
same semantics are split across multiple segments. When segments are
fragmented, it becomes difficult to predict an accurate target moment that
aligns with the text query. Also, they rely on skewed similarity distributions
for localization, making it difficult to select the optimal segment.
Furthermore, they heavily depend on the use of LLMs which require expensive
inferences. To address these limitations, we propose a \textit{TAG}, a simple
yet effective Temporal-Aware approach for zero-shot video temporal Grounding,
which incorporates temporal pooling, temporal coherence clustering, and
similarity adjustment. Our proposed method effectively captures the temporal
context of videos and addresses distorted similarity distributions without
training. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on Charades-STA and
ActivityNet Captions benchmark datasets without rely on LLMs. Our code is

Abstract: Accelerating Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reduces scan time but often
degrades image quality. While Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) show
promise for MRI reconstruction, they struggle at high acceleration factors due
to weak prior constraints, leading to structural loss and aliasing artefacts.
To address this, we propose PrIINeR, an INR-based MRI reconstruction method
that integrates prior knowledge from pre-trained deep learning models into the
INR framework. By combining population-level knowledge with instance-based
optimization and enforcing dual data consistency, PrIINeR aligns both with the
acquired k-space data and the prior-informed reconstruction. Evaluated on the
NYU fastMRI dataset, our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art INR-based
approaches but also improves upon several learning-based state-of-the-art
methods, significantly improving structural preservation and fidelity while
effectively removing aliasing artefacts.PrIINeR bridges deep learning and
INR-based techniques, offering a more reliable solution for high-quality,

Abstract: Advancement of machine learning techniques, combined with the availability of
large-scale datasets, has significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of
facial recognition. Modern facial recognition systems are trained using large
face datasets collected from diverse individuals or public repositories.
However, for training, these datasets are often replicated and stored in
multiple workstations, resulting in data replication, which complicates
database management and oversight. Currently, once a user submits their face
for dataset preparation, they lose control over how their data is used, raising
significant privacy and ethical concerns. This paper introduces VOIDFace, a
novel framework for facial recognition systems that addresses two major issues.
First, it eliminates the need of data replication and improves data control to
securely store training face data by using visual secret sharing. Second, it
proposes a patch-based multi-training network that uses this novel training
data storage mechanism to develop a robust, privacy-preserving facial
recognition system. By integrating these advancements, VOIDFace aims to improve
the privacy, security, and efficiency of facial recognition training, while
ensuring greater control over sensitive personal face data. VOIDFace also
enables users to exercise their Right-To-Be-Forgotten property to control their
personal data. Experimental evaluations on the VGGFace2 dataset show that
VOIDFace provides Right-To-Be-Forgotten, improved data control, security, and

Abstract: Providing intelligent support to surgical teams is a key frontier in

attainable, enabling a critical shift towards the more granular, staff-centric
analyses required for personalized intelligent systems in the operating room.
This new capability opens up various applications, including our proposed
temporal pathway imprints that translate raw tracking data into actionable

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症严重影响个体身心健康，社交媒体数据的易获取性为心理健康研究提供了新途径。

Method: MDD-Net包含声学特征提取、视觉特征提取、互注意力机制融合模块和检测层，利用D-Vlog数据集进行实验。

Result: 实验结果显示，MDD-Net在F1分数上比现有方法提升17.37%，性能显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: MDD-Net在多模态抑郁症检测中表现出色，为心理健康研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Depression is a major mental health condition that severely impacts the
emotional and physical well-being of individuals. The simple nature of data
collection from social media platforms has attracted significant interest in
properly utilizing this information for mental health research. A Multimodal
Depression Detection Network (MDD-Net), utilizing acoustic and visual data
obtained from social media networks, is proposed in this work where mutual
transformers are exploited to efficiently extract and fuse multimodal features
for efficient depression detection. The MDD-Net consists of four core modules:
an acoustic feature extraction module for retrieving relevant acoustic
attributes, a visual feature extraction module for extracting significant
high-level patterns, a mutual transformer for computing the correlations among
the generated features and fusing these features from multiple modalities, and
a detection layer for detecting depression using the fused feature
representations. The extensive experiments are performed using the multimodal
D-Vlog dataset, and the findings reveal that the developed multimodal
depression detection network surpasses the state-of-the-art by up to 17.37% for
F1-Score, demonstrating the greater performance of the proposed system. The

*Xiantao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在辅助盲人和视障人士（BVI）方面潜力巨大，但存在‘自动扶梯问题’——无法感知扶梯运行方向，揭示了‘隐式运动盲区’的深层限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示当前视频理解框架（基于离散帧采样）在感知连续低信号运动时的不足，及其对用户信任的影响。

Method: 通过‘自动扶梯问题’作为典型案例，分析隐式运动盲区的成因及其对MLLMs的局限性。

Result: 指出当前模型在动态环境中的物理感知不足，呼吁开发更注重安全和用户需求的新基准。

Conclusion: 呼吁从语义识别转向物理感知的范式转变，强调以用户为中心的设计和动态环境中的可靠性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold immense promise as assistive
technologies for the blind and visually impaired (BVI) community. However, we
identify a critical failure mode that undermines their trustworthiness in
real-world applications. We introduce the Escalator Problem -- the inability of
state-of-the-art models to perceive an escalator's direction of travel -- as a
canonical example of a deeper limitation we term Implicit Motion Blindness.
This blindness stems from the dominant frame-sampling paradigm in video
understanding, which, by treating videos as discrete sequences of static
images, fundamentally struggles to perceive continuous, low-signal motion. As a
position paper, our contribution is not a new model but rather to: (I) formally
articulate this blind spot, (II) analyze its implications for user trust, and
(III) issue a call to action. We advocate for a paradigm shift from purely
semantic recognition towards robust physical perception and urge the
development of new, human-centered benchmarks that prioritize safety,
reliability, and the genuine needs of users in dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProGraD利用可学习的群体提示和轻量级GroupContext Transformer改进群体活动检测，在复杂多群体场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Vision Foundation Models（VFMs）在群体动态建模中表现不足，需要更结构化的群体感知推理方法。

Method: 提出ProGraD方法，结合可学习的群体提示和两层的GroupContext Transformer，优化群体关联和集体行为推断。

Result: 在Cafe和Social-CAD基准测试中表现优异，尤其在多群体场景中提升显著（Group mAP@1.0提升6.5%）。

Conclusion: ProGraD不仅性能优越，还能生成可解释的注意力图，为群体推理提供洞察。

Abstract: Group Activity Detection (GAD) involves recognizing social groups and their
collective behaviors in videos. Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), like DinoV2,
offer excellent features, but are pretrained primarily on object-centric data
and remain underexplored for modeling group dynamics. While they are a
promising alternative to highly task-specific GAD architectures that require
full fine-tuning, our initial investigation reveals that simply swapping CNN
backbones used in these methods with VFMs brings little gain, underscoring the
need for structured, group-aware reasoning on top.
  We introduce Prompt-driven Group Activity Detection (ProGraD) -- a method
that bridges this gap through 1) learnable group prompts to guide the VFM
attention toward social configurations, and 2) a lightweight two-layer
GroupContext Transformer that infers actor-group associations and collective
behavior. We evaluate our approach on two recent GAD benchmarks: Cafe, which
features multiple concurrent social groups, and Social-CAD, which focuses on
single-group interactions. While we surpass state-of-the-art in both settings,
our method is especially effective in complex multi-group scenarios, where we
yield a gain of 6.5\% (Group mAP\@1.0) and 8.2\% (Group mAP\@0.5) using only
10M trainable parameters. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that ProGraD
produces interpretable attention maps, offering insights into actor-group
reasoning. Code and models will be released.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合任务特定和通用适配器（TUNA）的方法，解决类增量学习中模块选择和共享知识利用的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于预训练模型的类增量学习方法通常冻结预训练网络，使用轻量级模块（如适配器）适应增量任务，但模块选择错误和忽视共享知识会导致性能下降。

Method: 训练任务特定适配器捕捉关键特征，引入基于熵的选择机制，并通过适配器融合构建通用适配器，结合两者预测。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上展示了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: TUNA方法有效结合了任务特定和通用知识，提升了类增量学习的性能。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires a learning system to continually
learn new classes without forgetting. Existing pre-trained model-based CIL
methods often freeze the pre-trained network and adapt to incremental tasks
using additional lightweight modules such as adapters. However, incorrect
module selection during inference hurts performance, and task-specific modules
often overlook shared general knowledge, leading to errors on distinguishing
between similar classes across tasks. To address the aforementioned challenges,
we propose integrating Task-Specific and Universal Adapters (TUNA) in this
paper. Specifically, we train task-specific adapters to capture the most
crucial features relevant to their respective tasks and introduce an
entropy-based selection mechanism to choose the most suitable adapter.
Furthermore, we leverage an adapter fusion strategy to construct a universal
adapter, which encodes the most discriminative features shared across tasks. We
combine task-specific and universal adapter predictions to harness both
specialized and general knowledge during inference. Extensive experiments on
various benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our
approach. Code is available at: https://github.com/LAMDA-CL/ICCV2025-TUNA

Motivation: 主流AutoDA方法存在搜索耗时或性能不足的问题，SRA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出Sample-aware RandAugment (SRA)，结合启发式评分模块和非对称增强策略。

Result: 在ImageNet上达到78.31%的Top-1准确率，并兼容现有增强流程。

Conclusion: SRA为更简单、高效和实用的AutoDA设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: Automatic data augmentation (AutoDA) plays an important role in enhancing the
generalization of neural networks. However, mainstream AutoDA methods often
encounter two challenges: either the search process is excessively
time-consuming, hindering practical application, or the performance is
suboptimal due to insufficient policy adaptation during training. To address
these issues, we propose Sample-aware RandAugment (SRA), an asymmetric,
search-free AutoDA method that dynamically adjusts augmentation policies while
maintaining straightforward implementation. SRA incorporates a heuristic
scoring module that evaluates the complexity of the original training data,
enabling the application of tailored augmentations for each sample.
Additionally, an asymmetric augmentation strategy is employed to maximize the
potential of this scoring module. In multiple experimental settings, SRA
narrows the performance gap between search-based and search-free AutoDA
methods, achieving a state-of-the-art Top-1 accuracy of 78.31\% on ImageNet
with ResNet-50. Notably, SRA demonstrates good compatibility with existing
augmentation pipelines and solid generalization across new tasks, without
requiring hyperparameter tuning. The pretrained models leveraging SRA also
enhance recognition in downstream object detection tasks. SRA represents a
promising step towards simpler, more effective, and practical AutoDA designs
applicable to a variety of future tasks. Our code is available at

Method: 采用梯度显著性分析揭示CNN模型的偏差，并提出基于3D点云序列的方法，分离形状和运动特征。

Result: 实验显示RGB模型在临床环境中性能下降12%，而几何方法表现更稳定。

Conclusion: 几何表征能捕捉更有效的生物特征，为手术室中鲁棒的人员建模提供了方向。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are prone to learning spurious correlations, exploiting
dataset-specific artifacts rather than meaningful features for prediction. In
surgical operating rooms (OR), these manifest through the standardization of
smocks and gowns that obscure robust identifying landmarks, introducing model
bias for tasks related to modeling OR personnel. Through gradient-based
saliency analysis on two public OR datasets, we reveal that CNN models succumb
to such shortcuts, fixating on incidental visual cues such as footwear beneath
surgical gowns, distinctive eyewear, or other role-specific identifiers.
Avoiding such biases is essential for the next generation of intelligent
assistance systems in the OR, which should accurately recognize personalized
workflow traits, such as surgical skill level or coordination with other staff
members. We address this problem by encoding personnel as 3D point cloud
sequences, disentangling identity-relevant shape and motion patterns from
appearance-based confounders. Our experiments demonstrate that while RGB and
geometric methods achieve comparable performance on datasets with apparent
simulation artifacts, RGB models suffer a 12% accuracy drop in realistic
clinical settings with decreased visual diversity due to standardizations. This
performance gap confirms that geometric representations capture more meaningful
biometric features, providing an avenue to developing robust methods of
modeling humans in the OR.

Conclusion: TRIDE通过多模态融合和天气适应机制，显著提升了深度估计的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Depth estimation, essential for autonomous driving, seeks to interpret the 3D
environment surrounding vehicles. The development of radar sensors, known for
their cost-efficiency and robustness, has spurred interest in radar-camera
fusion-based solutions. However, existing algorithms fuse features from these
modalities without accounting for weather conditions, despite radars being
known to be more robust than cameras under adverse weather. Additionally, while
Vision-Language models have seen rapid advancement, utilizing language
descriptions alongside other modalities for depth estimation remains an open
challenge. This paper first introduces a text-generation strategy along with
feature extraction and fusion techniques that can assist monocular depth
estimation pipelines, leading to improved accuracy across different algorithms
on the KITTI dataset. Building on this, we propose TRIDE, a radar-camera fusion
algorithm that enhances text feature extraction by incorporating radar point
information. To address the impact of weather on sensor performance, we
introduce a weather-aware fusion block that adaptively adjusts radar weighting
based on current weather conditions. Our method, benchmarked on the nuScenes
dataset, demonstrates performance gains over the state-of-the-art, achieving a
12.87% improvement in MAE and a 9.08% improvement in RMSE. Code:

Conclusion: GRASPTrack通过深度感知和3D几何推理，有效解决了多目标跟踪中的遮挡和深度模糊问题，提升了复杂场景下的跟踪性能。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in monocular videos is fundamentally challenged
by occlusions and depth ambiguity, issues that conventional
tracking-by-detection (TBD) methods struggle to resolve owing to a lack of
geometric awareness. To address these limitations, we introduce GRASPTrack, a
novel depth-aware MOT framework that integrates monocular depth estimation and
instance segmentation into a standard TBD pipeline to generate high-fidelity 3D
point clouds from 2D detections, thereby enabling explicit 3D geometric
reasoning. These 3D point clouds are then voxelized to enable a precise and
robust Voxel-Based 3D Intersection-over-Union (IoU) for spatial association. To
further enhance tracking robustness, our approach incorporates Depth-aware
Adaptive Noise Compensation, which dynamically adjusts the Kalman filter
process noise based on occlusion severity for more reliable state estimation.
Additionally, we propose a Depth-enhanced Observation-Centric Momentum, which
extends the motion direction consistency from the image plane into 3D space to
improve motion-based association cues, particularly for objects with complex
trajectories. Extensive experiments on the MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance,
significantly improving tracking robustness in complex scenes with frequent
occlusions and intricate motion patterns.

Conclusion: 该方法为生成沉浸式3D视频提供了一种高效且无需额外训练的解决方案。

Abstract: While video generation models excel at producing high-quality monocular
videos, generating 3D stereoscopic and spatial videos for immersive
applications remains an underexplored challenge. We present a pose-free and
training-free method that leverages an off-the-shelf monocular video generation
model to produce immersive 3D videos. Our approach first warps the generated
monocular video into pre-defined camera viewpoints using estimated depth
information, then applies a novel \textit{frame matrix} inpainting framework.
This framework utilizes the original video generation model to synthesize
missing content across different viewpoints and timestamps, ensuring spatial
and temporal consistency without requiring additional model fine-tuning.
Moreover, we develop a \dualupdate~scheme that further improves the quality of
video inpainting by alleviating the negative effects propagated from
disoccluded areas in the latent space. The resulting multi-view videos are then
adapted into stereoscopic pairs or optimized into 4D Gaussians for spatial
video synthesis. We validate the efficacy of our proposed method by conducting
experiments on videos from various generative models, such as Sora, Lumiere,
WALT, and Zeroscope. The experiments demonstrate that our method has a
significant improvement over previous methods. Project page at:

Conclusion: IBCA能有效学习判别性类特定注意力，提升医学图像多标签分类的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) of medical images aims to identify multiple
diseases and holds significant clinical potential. A critical step is to learn
class-specific features for accurate diagnosis and improved interpretability
effectively. However, current works focus primarily on causal attention to
learn class-specific features, yet they struggle to interpret the true cause
due to the inadvertent attention to class-irrelevant features. To address this
challenge, we propose a new structural causal model (SCM) that treats
class-specific attention as a mixture of causal, spurious, and noisy factors,
and a novel Information Bottleneck-based Causal Attention (IBCA) that is
capable of learning the discriminative class-specific attention for MLC of
medical images. Specifically, we propose learning Gaussian mixture multi-label
spatial attention to filter out class-irrelevant information and capture each
class-specific attention pattern. Then a contrastive enhancement-based causal
intervention is proposed to gradually mitigate the spurious attention and
reduce noise information by aligning multi-head attention with the Gaussian
mixture multi-label spatial. Quantitative and ablation results on Endo and
MuReD show that IBCA outperforms all methods. Compared to the second-best
results for each metric, IBCA achieves improvements of 6.35\% in CR, 7.72\% in
OR, and 5.02\% in mAP for MuReD, 1.47\% in CR, and 1.65\% in CF1, and 1.42\% in

Conclusion: 通过协同策略和动态建模，新方法显著提升了微表情分析的准确性和灵活性。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are regarded as important indicators of an
individual's intrinsic emotions, preferences, and tendencies. ME analysis
requires spotting of ME intervals within long video sequences and recognition
of their corresponding emotional categories. Previous deep learning approaches
commonly employ sliding-window classification networks. However, the use of
fixed window lengths and hard classification presents notable limitations in
practice. Furthermore, these methods typically treat ME spotting and
recognition as two separate tasks, overlooking the essential relationship
between them. To address these challenges, this paper proposes two state space
model-based architectures, namely ME-TST and ME-TST+, which utilize temporal
state transition mechanisms to replace conventional window-level classification
with video-level regression. This enables a more precise characterization of
the temporal dynamics of MEs and supports the modeling of MEs with varying
durations. In ME-TST+, we further introduce multi-granularity ROI modeling and
the slowfast Mamba framework to alleviate information loss associated with
treating ME analysis as a time-series task. Additionally, we propose a synergy
strategy for spotting and recognition at both the feature and result levels,
leveraging their intrinsic connection to enhance overall analysis performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve
state-of-the-art performance. The codes are available at

Abstract: Explorable 3D world generation from a single image or text prompt forms a
cornerstone of spatial intelligence. Recent works utilize video model to
achieve wide-scope and generalizable 3D world generation. However, existing
approaches often suffer from a limited scope in the generated scenes. In this
work, we propose Matrix-3D, a framework that utilize panoramic representation
for wide-coverage omnidirectional explorable 3D world generation that combines
conditional video generation and panoramic 3D reconstruction. We first train a
trajectory-guided panoramic video diffusion model that employs scene mesh
renders as condition, to enable high-quality and geometrically consistent scene
video generation. To lift the panorama scene video to 3D world, we propose two
separate methods: (1) a feed-forward large panorama reconstruction model for
rapid 3D scene reconstruction and (2) an optimization-based pipeline for
accurate and detailed 3D scene reconstruction. To facilitate effective
training, we also introduce the Matrix-Pano dataset, the first large-scale
synthetic collection comprising 116K high-quality static panoramic video
sequences with depth and trajectory annotations. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance

Abstract: Plant roots typically exhibit a highly complex and dense architecture,
incorporating numerous slender lateral roots and branches, which significantly
hinders the precise capture and modeling of the entire root system.
Additionally, roots often lack sufficient texture and color information, making
it difficult to identify and track root traits using visual methods. Previous
research on roots has been largely confined to 2D studies; however, exploring
the 3D architecture of roots is crucial in botany. Since roots grow in real 3D
space, 3D phenotypic information is more critical for studying genetic traits
and their impact on root development. We have introduced a 3D root skeleton
extraction method that efficiently derives the 3D architecture of plant roots
from a few images. This method includes the detection and matching of lateral
roots, triangulation to extract the skeletal structure of lateral roots, and
the integration of lateral and primary roots. We developed a highly complex
root dataset and tested our method on it. The extracted 3D root skeletons
showed considerable similarity to the ground truth, validating the
effectiveness of the model. This method can play a significant role in
automated breeding robots. Through precise 3D root structure analysis, breeding
robots can better identify plant phenotypic traits, especially root structure
and growth patterns, helping practitioners select seeds with superior root
systems. This automated approach not only improves breeding efficiency but also
reduces manual intervention, making the breeding process more intelligent and
efficient, thus advancing modern agriculture.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的医学视觉-语言任务UMRG，并发布了数据集U-MRG-14K，同时提出了MedReasoner框架，通过强化学习优化推理和分割，取得了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学图像中的区域定位方法依赖显式空间提示，难以处理临床实践中的隐式查询，因此需要一种结合临床推理和像素级定位的新方法。

Method: 定义了UMRG任务，构建了U-MRG-14K数据集，并提出了MedReasoner框架，通过强化学习优化推理模块，同时利用冻结的分割模块生成掩码。

Result: MedReasoner在U-MRG-14K上达到最佳性能，并能泛化到未见过的临床查询。

Conclusion: 强化学习在可解释的医学定位中具有显著潜力。

Abstract: Accurately grounding regions of interest (ROIs) is critical for diagnosis and
treatment planning in medical imaging. While multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) combine visual perception with natural language, current
medical-grounding pipelines still rely on supervised fine-tuning with explicit
spatial hints, making them ill-equipped to handle the implicit queries common
in clinical practice. This work makes three core contributions. We first define
Unified Medical Reasoning Grounding (UMRG), a novel vision-language task that
demands clinical reasoning and pixel-level grounding. Second, we release
U-MRG-14K, a dataset of 14K samples featuring pixel-level masks alongside
implicit clinical queries and reasoning traces, spanning 10 modalities, 15
super-categories, and 108 specific categories. Finally, we introduce
MedReasoner, a modular framework that distinctly separates reasoning from
segmentation: an MLLM reasoner is optimized with reinforcement learning, while
a frozen segmentation expert converts spatial prompts into masks, with
alignment achieved through format and accuracy rewards. MedReasoner achieves
state-of-the-art performance on U-MRG-14K and demonstrates strong
generalization to unseen clinical queries, underscoring the significant promise
of reinforcement learning for interpretable medical grounding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TBAC-UniImage是一种新型多模态理解与生成统一模型，通过深度融合预训练的扩散模型和多模态大语言模型（MLLM），解决了现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散统一模型要么仅利用MLLM的最终隐藏状态（连接浅层），要么从头训练统一架构（计算成本高），限制了性能与实用性。

Method: 利用MLLM多个不同层的表征作为扩散模型的生成条件，将预训练生成器视为“梯子”，接受MLLM多层次理解的指导。

Result: TBAC-UniImage实现了更深层次、更细粒度的理解与生成统一。

Conclusion: 该方法为多模态任务提供了一种高效且性能优越的统一框架。

Abstract: This paper introduces TBAC-UniImage, a novel unified model for multimodal
understanding and generation. We achieve this by deeply integrating a
pre-trained Diffusion Model, acting as a generative ladder, with a Multimodal
Large Language Model (MLLM). Previous diffusion-based unified models face two
primary limitations. One approach uses only the MLLM's final hidden state as
the generative condition. This creates a shallow connection, as the generator
is isolated from the rich, hierarchical representations within the MLLM's
intermediate layers. The other approach, pretraining a unified generative
architecture from scratch, is computationally expensive and prohibitive for
many researchers. To overcome these issues, our work explores a new paradigm.
Instead of relying on a single output, we use representations from multiple,
diverse layers of the MLLM as generative conditions for the diffusion model.
This method treats the pre-trained generator as a ladder, receiving guidance
from various depths of the MLLM's understanding process. Consequently,
TBAC-UniImage achieves a much deeper and more fine-grained unification of
understanding and generation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需训练和掩码的框架Follow-Your-Shape，用于精确控制物体形状编辑，同时保护非目标内容。通过轨迹差异图（TDM）和计划KV注入机制实现稳定编辑，并在新基准ReShapeBench上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流式图像编辑模型在复杂场景（如大尺度形状变换）中表现不佳，容易影响非目标区域或无法实现预期形状变化。

Method: 提出TDM通过比较反转和去噪路径的令牌速度差异，定位可编辑区域；采用计划KV注入机制确保编辑稳定性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在大尺度形状替换任务中具有更高的编辑能力和视觉保真度。

Conclusion: Follow-Your-Shape框架在形状编辑任务中表现出色，为复杂编辑需求提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While recent flow-based image editing models demonstrate general-purpose
capabilities across diverse tasks, they often struggle to specialize in
challenging scenarios -- particularly those involving large-scale shape
transformations. When performing such structural edits, these methods either
fail to achieve the intended shape change or inadvertently alter non-target
regions, resulting in degraded background quality. We propose
Follow-Your-Shape, a training-free and mask-free framework that supports
precise and controllable editing of object shapes while strictly preserving
non-target content. Motivated by the divergence between inversion and editing
trajectories, we compute a Trajectory Divergence Map (TDM) by comparing
token-wise velocity differences between the inversion and denoising paths. The
TDM enables precise localization of editable regions and guides a Scheduled KV
Injection mechanism that ensures stable and faithful editing. To facilitate a
rigorous evaluation, we introduce ReShapeBench, a new benchmark comprising 120
new images and enriched prompt pairs specifically curated for shape-aware
editing. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior editability
and visual fidelity, particularly in tasks requiring large-scale shape
replacement.

Motivation: 当前3DGS风格迁移方法存在多视角不一致导致的风格冲突和VGG特征难以分离风格与内容的问题。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种场景和风格下均优于现有技术，实现更高的风格化质量和视觉真实感。

Conclusion: FantasyStyle通过创新方法有效解决了3D风格迁移的关键挑战，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: The success of 3DGS in generative and editing applications has sparked
growing interest in 3DGS-based style transfer. However, current methods still
face two major challenges: (1) multi-view inconsistency often leads to style
conflicts, resulting in appearance smoothing and distortion; and (2) heavy
reliance on VGG features, which struggle to disentangle style and content from
style images, often causing content leakage and excessive stylization. To
tackle these issues, we introduce \textbf{FantasyStyle}, a 3DGS-based style
transfer framework, and the first to rely entirely on diffusion model
distillation. It comprises two key components: (1) \textbf{Multi-View Frequency
Consistency}. We enhance cross-view consistency by applying a 3D filter to
multi-view noisy latent, selectively reducing low-frequency components to
mitigate stylized prior conflicts. (2) \textbf{Controllable Stylized
Distillation}. To suppress content leakage from style images, we introduce
negative guidance to exclude undesired content. In addition, we identify the
limitations of Score Distillation Sampling and Delta Denoising Score in 3D
style transfer and remove the reconstruction term accordingly. Building on
these insights, we propose a controllable stylized distillation that leverages
negative guidance to more effectively optimize the 3D Gaussians. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches, achieving higher stylization quality and visual
realism across various scenes and styles.

Conclusion: OMGSR框架通过优化潜在分布对齐和消除伪影，显著提升了一步式真实图像超分辨率的性能。

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and Flow Matching (FM)
generative models show promising potential for one-step Real-World Image
Super-Resolution (Real-ISR). Recent one-step Real-ISR models typically inject a
Low-Quality (LQ) image latent distribution at the initial timestep. However, a
fundamental gap exists between the LQ image latent distribution and the
Gaussian noisy latent distribution, limiting the effective utilization of
generative priors. We observe that the noisy latent distribution at DDPM/FM
mid-timesteps aligns more closely with the LQ image latent distribution. Based
on this insight, we present One Mid-timestep Guidance Real-ISR (OMGSR), a
universal framework applicable to DDPM/FM-based generative models. OMGSR
injects the LQ image latent distribution at a pre-computed mid-timestep,
incorporating the proposed Latent Distribution Refinement loss to alleviate the
latent distribution gap. We also design the Overlap-Chunked LPIPS/GAN loss to
eliminate checkerboard artifacts in image generation. Within this framework, we
instantiate OMGSR for DDPM/FM-based generative models with two variants:
OMGSR-S (SD-Turbo) and OMGSR-F (FLUX.1-dev). Experimental results demonstrate
that OMGSR-S/F achieves balanced/excellent performance across quantitative and
qualitative metrics at 512-resolution. Notably, OMGSR-F establishes
overwhelming dominance in all reference metrics. We further train a
1k-resolution OMGSR-F to match the default resolution of FLUX.1-dev, which
yields excellent results, especially in the details of the image generation. We
also generate 2k-resolution images by the 1k-resolution OMGSR-F using our
two-stage Tiled VAE & Diffusion.

TL;DR: 论文提出Next Shot Generation (NSG)框架Cut2Next，通过Diffusion Transformer生成符合专业剪辑模式且保持电影连续性的高质量镜头。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法多关注基础视觉一致性，忽略剪辑模式对叙事的重要性，导致生成结果缺乏叙事深度和电影完整性。

Method: 采用Diffusion Transformer (DiT)，结合Hierarchical Multi-Prompting策略（Relational Prompts和Individual Prompts）及Context-Aware Condition Injection (CACI)和Hierarchical Attention Mask (HAM)技术。

Result: 实验显示Cut2Next在视觉一致性和文本保真度上表现优异，用户研究验证其生成镜头符合剪辑模式和电影连续性。

Conclusion: Cut2Next能生成高质量、叙事表达丰富且电影连贯的后续镜头。

Abstract: Effective multi-shot generation demands purposeful, film-like transitions and
strict cinematic continuity. Current methods, however, often prioritize basic
visual consistency, neglecting crucial editing patterns (e.g., shot/reverse
shot, cutaways) that drive narrative flow for compelling storytelling. This
yields outputs that may be visually coherent but lack narrative sophistication
and true cinematic integrity. To bridge this, we introduce Next Shot Generation
(NSG): synthesizing a subsequent, high-quality shot that critically conforms to
professional editing patterns while upholding rigorous cinematic continuity.
Our framework, Cut2Next, leverages a Diffusion Transformer (DiT). It employs
in-context tuning guided by a novel Hierarchical Multi-Prompting strategy. This
strategy uses Relational Prompts to define overall context and inter-shot
editing styles. Individual Prompts then specify per-shot content and
cinematographic attributes. Together, these guide Cut2Next to generate
cinematically appropriate next shots. Architectural innovations, Context-Aware
Condition Injection (CACI) and Hierarchical Attention Mask (HAM), further
integrate these diverse signals without introducing new parameters. We
construct RawCuts (large-scale) and CuratedCuts (refined) datasets, both with
hierarchical prompts, and introduce CutBench for evaluation. Experiments show
Cut2Next excels in visual consistency and text fidelity. Crucially, user
studies reveal a strong preference for Cut2Next, particularly for its adherence
to intended editing patterns and overall cinematic continuity, validating its
ability to generate high-quality, narratively expressive, and cinematically
coherent subsequent shots.

Conclusion: 该框架有效缩小仿真与现实差距，提升自动驾驶训练效果，尤其在极端场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning for training end-to-end autonomous driving models in
closed-loop simulations is gaining growing attention. However, most simulation
environments differ significantly from real-world conditions, creating a
substantial simulation-to-reality (sim2real) gap. To bridge this gap, some
approaches utilize scene reconstruction techniques to create photorealistic
environments as a simulator. While this improves realistic sensor simulation,
these methods are inherently constrained by the distribution of the training
data, making it difficult to render high-quality sensor data for novel
trajectories or corner case scenarios. Therefore, we propose ReconDreamer-RL, a
framework designed to integrate video diffusion priors into scene
reconstruction to aid reinforcement learning, thereby enhancing end-to-end
autonomous driving training. Specifically, in ReconDreamer-RL, we introduce
ReconSimulator, which combines the video diffusion prior for appearance
modeling and incorporates a kinematic model for physical modeling, thereby
reconstructing driving scenarios from real-world data. This narrows the
sim2real gap for closed-loop evaluation and reinforcement learning. To cover
more corner-case scenarios, we introduce the Dynamic Adversary Agent (DAA),
which adjusts the trajectories of surrounding vehicles relative to the ego
vehicle, autonomously generating corner-case traffic scenarios (e.g., cut-in).
Finally, the Cousin Trajectory Generator (CTG) is proposed to address the issue
of training data distribution, which is often biased toward simple
straight-line movements. Experiments show that ReconDreamer-RL improves
end-to-end autonomous driving training, outperforming imitation learning
methods with a 5x reduction in the Collision Ratio.

Conclusion: CD-TVD显著提升了大规模科学模拟中的数据增强能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large-scale scientific simulations require significant resources to generate
high-resolution time-varying data (TVD). While super-resolution is an efficient
post-processing strategy to reduce costs, existing methods rely on a large
amount of HR training data, limiting their applicability to diverse simulation
scenarios. To address this constraint, we proposed CD-TVD, a novel framework
that combines contrastive learning and an improved diffusion-based
super-resolution model to achieve accurate 3D super-resolution from limited
time-step high-resolution data. During pre-training on historical simulation
data, the contrastive encoder and diffusion superresolution modules learn
degradation patterns and detailed features of high-resolution and
low-resolution samples. In the training phase, the improved diffusion model
with a local attention mechanism is fine-tuned using only one newly generated
high-resolution timestep, leveraging the degradation knowledge learned by the
encoder. This design minimizes the reliance on large-scale high-resolution
datasets while maintaining the capability to recover fine-grained details.
Experimental results on fluid and atmospheric simulation datasets confirm that
CD-TVD delivers accurate and resource-efficient 3D super-resolution, marking a
significant advancement in data augmentation for large-scale scientific
simulations. The code is available at

Abstract: Despite significant progress in 3D human mesh estimation from RGB images;
RGBD cameras, offering additional depth data, remain underutilized. In this
paper, we present a method for accurate 3D human mesh estimation from a single
RGBD view, leveraging the affordability and widespread adoption of RGBD cameras
for real-world applications. A fully supervised approach for this problem,
requires a dataset with RGBD image and 3D mesh label pairs. However, collecting
such a dataset is costly and challenging, hence, existing datasets are small,
and limited in pose and shape diversity. To overcome this data scarcity, we
leverage existing Motion Capture (MoCap) datasets. We first obtain complete 3D
meshes from the body models found in MoCap datasets, and create partial,
single-view versions of them by projection to a virtual camera. This simulates
the depth data provided by an RGBD camera from a single viewpoint. Then, we
train a masked autoencoder to complete the partial, single-view mesh. During
inference, our method, which we name as M$^3$ for ``Masked Mesh Modeling'',
matches the depth values coming from the sensor to vertices of a template human
mesh, which creates a partial, single-view mesh. We effectively recover parts
of the 3D human body mesh model that are not visible, resulting in a full body
mesh. M$^3$ achieves 16.8 mm and 22.0 mm per-vertex-error (PVE) on the SURREAL
and CAPE datasets, respectively; outperforming existing methods that use
full-body point clouds as input. We obtain a competitive 70.9 PVE on the BEHAVE
dataset, outperforming a recently published RGB based method by 18.4 mm,
highlighting the usefulness of depth data. Code will be released.

Conclusion: PP-Motion为运动生成提供了更全面的保真度评估方法，同时考虑了物理和感知因素。

Abstract: Human motion generation has found widespread applications in AR/VR, film,
sports, and medical rehabilitation, offering a cost-effective alternative to
traditional motion capture systems. However, evaluating the fidelity of such
generated motions is a crucial, multifaceted task. Although previous approaches
have attempted at motion fidelity evaluation using human perception or physical
constraints, there remains an inherent gap between human-perceived fidelity and
physical feasibility. Moreover, the subjective and coarse binary labeling of
human perception further undermines the development of a robust data-driven
metric. We address these issues by introducing a physical labeling method. This
method evaluates motion fidelity by calculating the minimum modifications
needed for a motion to align with physical laws. With this approach, we are
able to produce fine-grained, continuous physical alignment annotations that
serve as objective ground truth. With these annotations, we propose PP-Motion,
a novel data-driven metric to evaluate both physical and perceptual fidelity of
human motion. To effectively capture underlying physical priors, we employ
Pearson's correlation loss for the training of our metric. Additionally, by
incorporating a human-based perceptual fidelity loss, our metric can capture
fidelity that simultaneously considers both human perception and physical
alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that our metric, PP-Motion, not
only aligns with physical laws but also aligns better with human perception of
motion fidelity than previous work.

Motivation: 现有Transformer方法在高光谱图像融合中存在高频信号丢失和冗余令牌问题，限制了其性能。

Method: 提出了Pivotal Token Selective Attention (PTSA)和Multi-level Variance-aware Feed-forward Network (MVFN)，分别用于选择关键令牌和增强高频细节学习。

Result: 实验表明，THAT在标准基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，提升了重建质量和效率。

Conclusion: THAT通过改进高频特征表示和令牌选择，显著提升了高光谱图像融合的效果。

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have demonstrated strong potential in hyperspectral
pansharpening by modeling long-range dependencies. However, their effectiveness
is often limited by redundant token representations and a lack of multi-scale
feature modeling. Hyperspectral images exhibit intrinsic spectral priors (e.g.,
abundance sparsity) and spatial priors (e.g., non-local similarity), which are
critical for accurate reconstruction. From a spectral-spatial perspective,
Vision Transformers (ViTs) face two major limitations: they struggle to
preserve high-frequency components--such as material edges and texture
transitions--and suffer from attention dispersion across redundant tokens.
These issues stem from the global self-attention mechanism, which tends to
dilute high-frequency signals and overlook localized details. To address these
challenges, we propose the Token-wise High-frequency Augmentation Transformer
(THAT), a novel framework designed to enhance hyperspectral pansharpening
through improved high-frequency feature representation and token selection.
Specifically, THAT introduces: (1) Pivotal Token Selective Attention (PTSA) to
prioritize informative tokens and suppress redundancy; (2) a Multi-level
Variance-aware Feed-forward Network (MVFN) to enhance high-frequency detail
learning. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that THAT achieves
state-of-the-art performance with improved reconstruction quality and
efficiency. The source code is available at https://github.com/kailuo93/THAT.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of structural defects in civil infrastructure remains
challenging due to variable defect appearances, harsh imaging conditions, and
significant class imbalance. Current deep learning methods, despite their
effectiveness, typically require millions of parameters, rendering them
impractical for real-time inspection systems. We introduce KARMA
(Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Mapping Architecture), a highly efficient
semantic segmentation framework that models complex defect patterns through
compositions of one-dimensional functions rather than conventional
convolutions. KARMA features three technical innovations: (1) a
parameter-efficient Tiny Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (TiKAN) module leveraging
low-rank factorization for KAN-based feature transformation; (2) an optimized
feature pyramid structure with separable convolutions for multi-scale defect
analysis; and (3) a static-dynamic prototype mechanism that enhances feature
representation for imbalanced classes. Extensive experiments on benchmark
infrastructure inspection datasets demonstrate that KARMA achieves competitive
or superior mean IoU performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while
using significantly fewer parameters (0.959M vs. 31.04M, a 97% reduction).
Operating at 0.264 GFLOPS, KARMA maintains inference speeds suitable for
real-time deployment, enabling practical automated infrastructure inspection
systems without compromising accuracy. The source code can be accessed at the

Abstract: Recent advances at the intersection of reinforcement learning (RL) and visual
intelligence have enabled agents that not only perceive complex visual scenes
but also reason, generate, and act within them. This survey offers a critical
and up-to-date synthesis of the field. We first formalize visual RL problems
and trace the evolution of policy-optimization strategies from RLHF to
verifiable reward paradigms, and from Proximal Policy Optimization to Group
Relative Policy Optimization. We then organize more than 200 representative
works into four thematic pillars: multi-modal large language models, visual
generation, unified model frameworks, and vision-language-action models. For
each pillar we examine algorithmic design, reward engineering, benchmark
progress, and we distill trends such as curriculum-driven training,
preference-aligned diffusion, and unified reward modeling. Finally, we review
evaluation protocols spanning set-level fidelity, sample-level preference, and
state-level stability, and we identify open challenges that include sample
efficiency, generalization, and safe deployment. Our goal is to provide
researchers and practitioners with a coherent map of the rapidly expanding
landscape of visual RL and to highlight promising directions for future
inquiry. Resources are available at:

*Peiqi He,Zhenhao Zhang,Yixiang Zhang,Xiongjun Zhao,Shaoliang Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Spatial-ORMLLM是一种仅使用RGB模态的大型视觉语言模型，用于手术室3D空间推理，解决了现有方法在多模态数据获取和2D数据细节不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术室精确的空间建模对临床任务至关重要，但现有方法依赖多模态数据或忽略3D能力，导致数据获取困难和细节缺失。

Method: 提出Spatial-ORMLLM，通过Spatial-Enhanced Feature Fusion Block将2D输入与3D空间知识结合，采用端到端MLLM框架实现3D推理。

Result: 在多个临床数据集上表现优异，泛化能力强，适用于未见手术场景和下游任务。

Conclusion: Spatial-ORMLLM为手术室3D空间推理提供了高效解决方案，无需额外传感器或专家标注。

Abstract: Precise spatial modeling in the operating room (OR) is foundational to many
clinical tasks, supporting intraoperative awareness, hazard avoidance, and
surgical decision-making. While existing approaches leverage large-scale
multimodal datasets for latent-space alignment to implicitly learn spatial
relationships, they overlook the 3D capabilities of MLLMs. However, this
approach raises two issues: (1) Operating rooms typically lack multiple video
and audio sensors, making multimodal 3D data difficult to obtain; (2) Training
solely on readily available 2D data fails to capture fine-grained details in
complex scenes. To address this gap, we introduce Spatial-ORMLLM, the first
large vision-language model for 3D spatial reasoning in operating rooms using
only RGB modality to infer volumetric and semantic cues, enabling downstream
medical tasks with detailed and holistic spatial context. Spatial-ORMLLM
incorporates a Spatial-Enhanced Feature Fusion Block, which integrates 2D
modality inputs with rich 3D spatial knowledge extracted by the estimation
algorithm and then feeds the combined features into the visual tower. By
employing a unified end-to-end MLLM framework, it combines powerful spatial
features with textual features to deliver robust 3D scene reasoning without any
additional expert annotations or sensor inputs. Experiments on multiple
benchmark clinical datasets demonstrate that Spatial-ORMLLM achieves
state-of-the-art performance and generalizes robustly to previously unseen
surgical scenarios and downstream tasks.

TL;DR: SAGOnline是一个轻量级、零样本的实时3D分割框架，通过视频基础模型和GPU加速算法解决了3D高斯场景中的分割与跟踪问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在3D高斯场景分割中存在计算成本高、空间推理能力有限以及无法同时跟踪多对象的问题。

Method: 结合视频基础模型（如SAM2）进行视图一致的2D掩码传播，并采用GPU加速的3D掩码生成和高斯级实例标记算法。

Result: 在NVOS和Spin-NeRF基准测试中表现优异（92.7%和95.2% mIoU），推理速度提升15-1500倍（27毫秒/帧）。

Conclusion: SAGOnline实现了实时渲染和3D场景理解，为AR/VR和机器人应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for explicit
3D scene representation, yet achieving efficient and consistent 3D segmentation
remains challenging. Current methods suffer from prohibitive computational
costs, limited 3D spatial reasoning, and an inability to track multiple objects
simultaneously. We present Segment Any Gaussians Online (SAGOnline), a
lightweight and zero-shot framework for real-time 3D segmentation in Gaussian
scenes that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a
decoupled strategy that integrates video foundation models (e.g., SAM2) for
view-consistent 2D mask propagation across synthesized views; and (2) a
GPU-accelerated 3D mask generation and Gaussian-level instance labeling
algorithm that assigns unique identifiers to 3D primitives, enabling lossless
multi-object tracking and segmentation across views. SAGOnline achieves
state-of-the-art performance on NVOS (92.7% mIoU) and Spin-NeRF (95.2% mIoU)
benchmarks, outperforming Feature3DGS, OmniSeg3D-gs, and SA3D by 15--1500 times
in inference speed (27 ms/frame). Qualitative results demonstrate robust
multi-object segmentation and tracking in complex scenes. Our contributions
include: (i) a lightweight and zero-shot framework for 3D segmentation in
Gaussian scenes, (ii) explicit labeling of Gaussian primitives enabling
simultaneous segmentation and tracking, and (iii) the effective adaptation of
2D video foundation models to the 3D domain. This work allows real-time
rendering and 3D scene understanding, paving the way for practical AR/VR and
robotic applications.

*Wenyi Mo,Ying Ba,Tianyu Zhang,Yalong Bai,Biye Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多模态大语言模型的方法，通过对比偏好损失和偏好标记学习用户个性化偏好，显著提升了偏好预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖通用偏好或静态用户画像，忽略了用户偏好的动态性和多样性。

Method: 采用多模态大语言模型，引入对比偏好损失和偏好标记，从历史交互中学习个性化偏好。

Result: 模型在偏好预测准确性上优于其他方法，能有效识别相似审美倾向的用户。

Conclusion: 该方法能更精准地生成符合用户口味的图像，为个性化推荐提供支持。

Abstract: User preference prediction requires a comprehensive and accurate
understanding of individual tastes. This includes both surface-level
attributes, such as color and style, and deeper content-related aspects, such
as themes and composition. However, existing methods typically rely on general
human preferences or assume static user profiles, often neglecting individual
variability and the dynamic, multifaceted nature of personal taste. To address
these limitations, we propose an approach built upon Multimodal Large Language
Models, introducing contrastive preference loss and preference tokens to learn
personalized user preferences from historical interactions. The contrastive
preference loss is designed to effectively distinguish between user ''likes''
and ''dislikes'', while the learnable preference tokens capture shared interest
representations among existing users, enabling the model to activate
group-specific preferences and enhance consistency across similar users.
Extensive experiments demonstrate our model outperforms other methods in
preference prediction accuracy, effectively identifying users with similar
aesthetic inclinations and providing more precise guidance for generating
images that align with individual tastes. The project page is

TL;DR: StableAvatar是一种端到端的视频扩散变换器，能够生成无限长度的高质量视频，解决了现有模型在音频同步和身份一致性上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频驱动的虚拟化身视频生成模型难以生成长视频且音频同步和身份一致性差。

Method: 提出Time-step-aware Audio Adapter和Audio Native Guidance Mechanism，结合Dynamic Weighted Sliding-window Strategy。

Result: 实验证明StableAvatar在质量和数量上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: StableAvatar通过创新的音频建模和推理策略，实现了高质量、无限长度的视频生成。

Abstract: Current diffusion models for audio-driven avatar video generation struggle to
synthesize long videos with natural audio synchronization and identity
consistency. This paper presents StableAvatar, the first end-to-end video
diffusion transformer that synthesizes infinite-length high-quality videos
without post-processing. Conditioned on a reference image and audio,
StableAvatar integrates tailored training and inference modules to enable
infinite-length video generation. We observe that the main reason preventing
existing models from generating long videos lies in their audio modeling. They
typically rely on third-party off-the-shelf extractors to obtain audio
embeddings, which are then directly injected into the diffusion model via
cross-attention. Since current diffusion backbones lack any audio-related
priors, this approach causes severe latent distribution error accumulation
across video clips, leading the latent distribution of subsequent segments to
drift away from the optimal distribution gradually. To address this,
StableAvatar introduces a novel Time-step-aware Audio Adapter that prevents
error accumulation via time-step-aware modulation. During inference, we propose
a novel Audio Native Guidance Mechanism to further enhance the audio
synchronization by leveraging the diffusion's own evolving joint audio-latent
prediction as a dynamic guidance signal. To enhance the smoothness of the
infinite-length videos, we introduce a Dynamic Weighted Sliding-window Strategy
that fuses latent over time. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness
of StableAvatar both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: ReferSplat为3D多模态理解提供了有效解决方案，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: We introduce Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation (R3DGS), a new task
that aims to segment target objects in a 3D Gaussian scene based on natural
language descriptions, which often contain spatial relationships or object
attributes. This task requires the model to identify newly described objects
that may be occluded or not directly visible in a novel view, posing a
significant challenge for 3D multi-modal understanding. Developing this
capability is crucial for advancing embodied AI. To support research in this
area, we construct the first R3DGS dataset, Ref-LERF. Our analysis reveals that
3D multi-modal understanding and spatial relationship modeling are key
challenges for R3DGS. To address these challenges, we propose ReferSplat, a
framework that explicitly models 3D Gaussian points with natural language
expressions in a spatially aware paradigm. ReferSplat achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both the newly proposed R3DGS task and 3D open-vocabulary
segmentation benchmarks. Dataset and code are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于物理原理的神经网络方法，从单张图像生成4D场景（包含3D几何和运动），解决了现有方法动画不真实的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能从单张图像想象4D场景，但现有神经网络方法生成的动画常违背物理原理。本文旨在通过物理约束提升动画的真实性。

Method: 使用物理启发的神经网络预测表面点运动，结合Navier-Stokes方程等物理损失项；从图像和深度预测3D高斯特征，并渲染动画。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成物理一致的动画，性能显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功实现了从单张图像生成物理真实的4D场景，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Humans possess an exceptional ability to imagine 4D scenes, encompassing both
motion and 3D geometry, from a single still image. This ability is rooted in
our accumulated observations of similar scenes and an intuitive understanding
of physics. In this paper, we aim to replicate this capacity in neural
networks, specifically focusing on natural fluid imagery. Existing methods for
this task typically employ simplistic 2D motion estimators to animate the
image, leading to motion predictions that often defy physical principles,
resulting in unrealistic animations. Our approach introduces a novel method for
generating 4D scenes with physics-consistent animation from a single image. We
propose the use of a physics-informed neural network that predicts motion for
each surface point, guided by a loss term derived from fundamental physical
principles, including the Navier-Stokes equations. To capture appearance, we
predict feature-based 3D Gaussians from the input image and its estimated
depth, which are then animated using the predicted motions and rendered from
any desired camera perspective. Experimental results highlight the
effectiveness of our method in producing physically plausible animations,
showcasing significant performance improvements over existing methods. Our

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种半自动化事实核查（SAFC）系统，针对葡萄牙语新闻语料库，通过结合外部证据增强数据集，弥补现有资源的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于虚假信息传播速度快于人工核查能力，且葡萄牙语缺乏结合外部证据的数据集，亟需开发SAFC系统。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLMs）提取文本主要主张，并通过搜索引擎API检索外部证据，同时引入数据验证和预处理框架。

Result: 开发了针对葡萄牙语新闻语料库（Fake.Br、COVID19.BR、MuMiN-PT）的增强数据集，并验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为葡萄牙语SAFC系统提供了更丰富的数据支持，提升了事实核查的效率和准确性。

Abstract: The accelerated dissemination of disinformation often outpaces the capacity
for manual fact-checking, highlighting the urgent need for Semi-Automated
Fact-Checking (SAFC) systems. Within the Portuguese language context, there is
a noted scarcity of publicly available datasets that integrate external
evidence, an essential component for developing robust AFC systems, as many
existing resources focus solely on classification based on intrinsic text
features. This dissertation addresses this gap by developing, applying, and
analyzing a methodology to enrich Portuguese news corpora (Fake.Br, COVID19.BR,
MuMiN-PT) with external evidence. The approach simulates a user's verification
process, employing Large Language Models (LLMs, specifically Gemini 1.5 Flash)
to extract the main claim from texts and search engine APIs (Google Search API,
Google FactCheck Claims Search API) to retrieve relevant external documents
(evidence). Additionally, a data validation and preprocessing framework,
including near-duplicate detection, is introduced to enhance the quality of the
base corpora.

TL;DR: 论文研究了动态提示策略对少样本生物医学命名实体识别（NER）的性能提升，通过检索增强生成（RAG）优化提示，显著提高了模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在少样本生物医学NER任务中的性能挑战。

Method: 采用动态提示策略，结合检索增强生成（RAG），根据输入文本相似性选择上下文学习示例，并在推理时动态更新提示。

Result: 动态提示显著提升性能，TF-IDF和SBERT检索方法在5-shot和10-shot设置下分别提高F1分数7.3%和5.6%。

Conclusion: 上下文自适应的动态提示策略对生物医学NER任务具有显著实用价值。

Abstract: Biomedical named entity recognition (NER) is a high-utility natural language
processing (NLP) task, and large language models (LLMs) show promise
particularly in few-shot settings (i.e., limited training data). In this
article, we address the performance challenges of LLMs for few-shot biomedical
NER by investigating a dynamic prompting strategy involving retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG). In our approach, the annotated in-context learning examples
are selected based on their similarities with the input texts, and the prompt
is dynamically updated for each instance during inference. We implemented and
optimized static and dynamic prompt engineering techniques and evaluated them
on five biomedical NER datasets. Static prompting with structured components
increased average F1-scores by 12% for GPT-4, and 11% for GPT-3.5 and LLaMA
3-70B, relative to basic static prompting. Dynamic prompting further improved
performance, with TF-IDF and SBERT retrieval methods yielding the best results,
improving average F1-scores by 7.3% and 5.6% in 5-shot and 10-shot settings,
respectively. These findings highlight the utility of contextually adaptive
prompts via RAG for biomedical NER.

TL;DR: 论文提出了CarbonScaling框架，将神经扩展定律与碳排放结合，量化模型精度与碳足迹的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经扩展定律忽略了LLM规模扩大带来的碳排放问题，需结合碳排放优化模型训练。

Method: 通过整合神经扩展模型、GPU硬件演进、并行优化和碳排放估算，构建CarbonScaling框架。

Result: 精度与碳排放呈幂律关系，但实际效率问题增加了扩展因子；硬件技术进步对小中型模型有效，但对超大型LLM效果有限。

Conclusion: CarbonScaling为训练更可持续和高效的LLM提供了关键见解，优化训练策略可减少碳排放。

Abstract: Neural scaling laws have driven the development of increasingly large
language models (LLMs) by linking accuracy improvements to growth in parameter
count, dataset size, and compute. However, these laws overlook the carbon
emissions that scale exponentially with LLM size. This paper presents
\textit{CarbonScaling}, an analytical framework that extends neural scaling
laws to incorporate both operational and embodied carbon in LLM training. By
integrating models for neural scaling, GPU hardware evolution, parallelism
optimization, and carbon estimation, \textit{CarbonScaling} quantitatively
connects model accuracy to carbon footprint. Results show that while a
power-law relationship between accuracy and carbon holds, real-world
inefficiencies significantly increase the scaling factor. Hardware technology
scaling reduces carbon emissions for small to mid-sized models, but offers
diminishing returns for extremely large LLMs due to communication overhead and
underutilized GPUs. Training optimizations-especially aggressive critical batch
size scaling-help alleviate this inefficiency. \textit{CarbonScaling} offers
key insights for training more sustainable and carbon-efficient LLMs.

Motivation: 现有tokenizer在多语言环境中效率低下，token-to-word比例高，影响了模型性能和推理速度。

Method: 通过系统研究词汇量、预分词规则和训练语料组成，提出了一种新的数据组合算法，并在印度语系脚本上进行了实验验证。

Result: 新算法将token-to-word比例平均降低了6%，比现有多语言印度语模型提升了40%以上，显著提高了模型性能和推理速度。

Conclusion: tokenization是构建高效、可扩展多语言LLM的关键因素之一，与模型架构和训练目标同等重要。

Abstract: While model architecture and training objectives are well-studied,
tokenization, particularly in multilingual contexts, remains a relatively
neglected aspect of Large Language Model (LLM) development. Existing tokenizers
often exhibit high token-to-word ratios, inefficient use of context length, and
slower inference. We present a systematic study that links vocabulary size,
pre-tokenization rules, and training-corpus composition to both token-to-word
efficiency and model quality. To ground our analysis in a linguistically
diverse context, we conduct extensive experiments on Indic scripts, which
present unique challenges due to their high script diversity and orthographic
complexity. Drawing on the insights from these analyses, we propose a novel
algorithm for data composition that balances multilingual data for tokenizer
training. Our observations on pretokenization strategies significantly improve
model performance, and our data composition algorithm reduces the average
token-to-word ratio by approximately 6% with respect to the conventional data
randomization approach. Our tokenizer achieves more than 40% improvement on
average token-to-word ratio against stateof-the-art multilingual Indic models.
This improvement yields measurable gains in both model performance and
inference speed. This highlights tokenization alongside architecture and
training objectives as a critical lever for building efficient, scalable
multilingual LLMs

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维文本嵌入在计算效率和成本上存在问题，需要一种方法直接在学习流程中降维。

Method: AEALT框架结合监督增强自编码器，从文本嵌入中学习低维任务相关潜在因子。

Result: 实验表明AEALT在分类、异常检测和预测任务中优于原始嵌入和传统降维方法。

Conclusion: AEALT通过建模非线性结构显著提升性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate text embeddings from text data,
producing vector representations that capture the semantic meaning and
contextual relationships of words. However, the high dimensionality of these
embeddings often impedes efficiency and drives up computational cost in
downstream tasks. To address this, we propose AutoEncoder-Augmented Learning
with Text (AEALT), a supervised, factor-augmented framework that incorporates
dimension reduction directly into pre-trained LLM workflows. First, we extract
embeddings from text documents; next, we pass them through a supervised
augmented autoencoder to learn low-dimensional, task-relevant latent factors.
By modeling the nonlinear structure of complex embeddings, AEALT outperforms
conventional deep-learning approaches that rely on raw embeddings. We validate
its broad applicability with extensive experiments on classification, anomaly
detection, and prediction tasks using multiple real-world public datasets.
Numerical results demonstrate that AEALT yields substantial gains over both
vanilla embeddings and several standard dimension reduction methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是评估大型语言模型是否能像专家导师一样动态调整教学策略，而不仅仅是生成问题。

Method: 提出了GuideEval基准，基于三阶段行为框架（感知、编排、激发）评估教学指导能力，并引入行为引导微调策略。

Result: 实证发现现有模型在适应学习者状态时表现不佳，但微调策略显著提升了指导性能。

Conclusion: 研究倡导从孤立内容评估转向以学习者为中心的交互范式，为Socratic语言模型评估提供了新视角。

Abstract: The conversational capabilities of large language models hold significant
promise for enabling scalable and interactive tutoring. While prior research
has primarily examined their capacity for Socratic questioning, it often
overlooks a critical dimension: adaptively guiding learners based on their
cognitive states. This study shifts focus from mere question generation to the
broader instructional guidance capability. We ask: Can LLMs emulate expert
tutors who dynamically adjust strategies in response to learners'
understanding? To investigate this, we propose GuideEval, a benchmark grounded
in authentic educational dialogues that evaluates pedagogical guidance through
a three-phase behavioral framework: (1) Perception, inferring learner states;
(2) Orchestration, adapting instructional strategies; and (3) Elicitation,
stimulating proper reflections. Empirical findings reveal that existing LLMs
frequently fail to provide effective adaptive scaffolding when learners exhibit
confusion or require redirection. Furthermore, we introduce a behavior-guided
finetuning strategy that leverages behavior-prompted instructional dialogues,
significantly enhancing guidance performance. By shifting the focus from
isolated content evaluation to learner-centered interaction, our work advocates
a more dialogic paradigm for evaluating Socratic LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大语言模型可能编码敏感、有害或受版权保护的知识，需要一种无需完全重新训练即可遗忘特定知识的方法。

Result: 实验表明，合成数据集优于基线方法，且与专家整理的数据集效果相当。数据多样性提升显著提高遗忘效果。

Conclusion: 合成数据集为广泛领域的实用、可扩展遗忘提供了一条可行路径。

Abstract: Modern large language models often encode sensitive, harmful, or copyrighted
knowledge, raising the need for post-hoc unlearning-the ability to remove
specific domains of knowledge from a model without full retraining. A major
bottleneck in current unlearning pipelines is constructing effective forget
sets-datasets that approximate the target domain and guide the model to forget
it. In this work, we introduce a scalable, automated approach to generate
high-quality forget sets using language models themselves. Our method
synthesizes textbook-style data through a structured prompting pipeline,
requiring only a domain name as input. Through experiments on unlearning
biosecurity, cybersecurity, and Harry Potter novels, we show that our synthetic
datasets consistently outperform the baseline synthetic alternatives and are
comparable to the expert-curated ones. Additionally, ablation studies reveal
that the multi-step generation pipeline significantly boosts data diversity,
which in turn improves unlearning utility. Overall, our findings suggest that
synthetic datasets offer a promising path toward practical, scalable unlearning
for a wide range of emerging domains without the need for manual intervention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法（如BrowseComp）依赖动态且不透明的网络搜索API，导致公平性和透明度问题，难以对深度研究LLM的能力进行准确评估。

Method: 引入BrowseComp-Plus基准，使用固定且精心筛选的语料库，每个查询包含人工验证的支持文档和挑战性负样本，支持可控实验。

Conclusion: BrowseComp-Plus为深度研究系统和检索方法提供了全面的评估框架，有助于分析检索效果、引用准确性和上下文工程。

Abstract: Deep-Research agents, which integrate large language models (LLMs) with
search tools, have shown success in improving the effectiveness of handling
complex queries that require iterative search planning and reasoning over
search results. Evaluations on current benchmarks like BrowseComp relies on
black-box live web search APIs, have notable limitations in (1) fairness:
dynamic and opaque web APIs hinder fair comparisons and reproducibility of deep
research methods; (2) transparency: lack of control over the document corpus
makes it difficult to isolate retriever contributions. In other words, the
current evaluations may compare a complete deep research system at a given
time, but they do not foster well-controlled experiments to provide insights
into the capability of underlying deep research LLMs. To address these
challenges, we introduce BrowseComp-Plus, a benchmark derived from BrowseComp,
employing a fixed, carefully curated corpus. Each query in BrowseComp-Plus
includes human-verified supporting documents and mined challenging negatives,
enabling controlled experimentation. The benchmark is shown to be effective in
distinguishing the performance of deep research systems. For instance, the
open-source model Search-R1, when paired with the BM25 retriever, achieves
3.86% accuracy, whereas the GPT-5 achieves 55.9%. Integrating the GPT-5 with
the Qwen3-Embedding-8B retriever further enhances its accuracy to 70.1% with
fewer search calls. This benchmark allows comprehensive evaluation and
disentangled analysis of deep research agents and retrieval methods, fostering
insights into retrieval effectiveness, citation accuracy, and context
engineering in Deep-Research system.

*Tomohiro Sawada,Kartik Goyal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了不依赖合并列表的BPE推理算法对语言模型性能的影响，发现非目标性算法对性能影响较小，可能提供更简单的隐私保护方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索BPE推理算法是否可以不依赖合并列表，以减少潜在的信息泄露风险。

Method: 研究两类BPE推理方案：目标性偏离合并列表（如随机合并顺序）和非目标性算法（不依赖合并列表）。

Result: 目标性偏离显著降低性能，而非目标性算法对性能影响极小。

Conclusion: 非目标性算法为更简单、隐私保护的标记化方案提供了可能。

Abstract: Standard Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization compresses text by pairing a
learned token vocabulary with a detailed merge list. Recent work has shown that
this merge list exposes a potential attack surface for extracting information
about language model's training data. In this paper, we explore the downstream
impact of BPE inference algorithms that do not rely on this merge list at all,
and hence differ from the encoding process during BPE training. To address this
question, we investigate two broad classes of BPE inference schemes that differ
from BPE application during training: a) targeted deviation from merge-lists
including random merge orders, and various corruptions of merge list involving
deletion/truncation, and b) non-targeted BPE inference algorithms that do not
depend on the merge list but focus on compressing the text either greedily or
exactly. Extensive experiments across diverse language modeling tasks like
accuracy-based QA benchmarks, machine translation, and open-ended generation
reveal that while targeted deviation from the merge lists exhibits significant
degradation in language model performance, the non-targeted merge-list-free
inference algorithms result in minimal impact on downstream performance that is
often much smaller than expected. These findings pave way for simpler and
potentially more privacy-preserving tokenization schemes that do not
catastrophically compromise model performance.

*Daniel Wang,Eli Brignac,Minjia Mao,Xiao Fang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）存在刻板印象偏差和偏离偏差，可能对多群体造成潜在危害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在生成内容时可能表现出的两种偏差，以揭示其潜在风险。

Method: 通过让四种先进LLMs生成个人资料，分析其与政治、宗教等属性的关联。

Result: 所有测试的LLMs均对多群体表现出显著的刻板印象和偏离偏差。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在推断用户属性时的偏差及其潜在危害。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely applied across diverse domains,
raising concerns about their limitations and potential risks. In this study, we
investigate two types of bias that LLMs may display: stereotype bias and
deviation bias. Stereotype bias refers to when LLMs consistently associate
specific traits with a particular demographic group. Deviation bias reflects
the disparity between the demographic distributions extracted from
LLM-generated content and real-world demographic distributions. By asking four
advanced LLMs to generate profiles of individuals, we examine the associations
between each demographic group and attributes such as political affiliation,
religion, and sexual orientation. Our experimental results show that all
examined LLMs exhibit both significant stereotype bias and deviation bias
towards multiple groups. Our findings uncover the biases that occur when LLMs
infer user attributes and shed light on the potential harms of LLM-generated
outputs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何利用语言资源（如语法和并行句子）提升大型语言模型（LLM）在低资源语言（如Kanuri）翻译中的表现，发现并行句子效果最佳，而语法单独使用效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kanuri语言虽使用人口众多，但数字资源匮乏，研究旨在探索如何利用有限资源提升LLM的翻译质量。

Method: 设计两个数据集（健康和通用术语），测试不同语言资源组合（语法、词典、并行句子）对翻译的影响，并与人工翻译对比。

Result: 并行句子效果最好，语法单独使用效果有限；LLM在准确性上优于流畅性。

Conclusion: LLM翻译评估需多维度指标，语法单独使用不足以支持有效翻译。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art models demonstrate capacity to leverage in-context
learning to translate into previously unseen language contexts. Tanzer et al.
[2024] utilize language materials (e.g. a grammar) to improve translation
quality for Kalamang using large language models (LLMs). We focus on Kanuri, a
language that, despite having substantial speaker population, has minimal
digital resources. We design two datasets for evaluation: one focused on health
and humanitarian terms, and another containing generalized terminology,
investigating how domain-specific tasks impact LLM translation quality.
  By providing different combinations of language resources (grammar,
dictionary, and parallel sentences), we measure LLM translation effectiveness,
comparing results to native speaker translations and human linguist
performance. We evaluate using both automatic metrics and native speaker
assessments of fluency and accuracy.
  Results demonstrate that parallel sentences remain the most effective data
source, outperforming other methods in human evaluations and automatic metrics.
While incorporating grammar improves over zero-shot translation, it fails as an
effective standalone data source. Human evaluations reveal that LLMs achieve
accuracy (meaning) more effectively than fluency (grammaticality).
  These findings suggest LLM translation evaluation benefits from
multidimensional assessment beyond simple accuracy metrics, and that grammar
alone, without parallel sentences, does not provide sufficient context for
effective domain-specific translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语言模型表现优异，但其存在的性别、种族等偏见问题限制了实际应用。本文旨在探究思维链提示是否能揭示模型的偏见思维。

Method: 通过公平性指标对5种流行大语言模型的思维步骤和输出进行偏见量化，分析11种不同偏见的关联性。

Result: 模型思维步骤中的偏见与输出偏见相关性较低（多数情况下相关系数小于0.6，p值小于0.001）。

Conclusion: 与人类不同，测试模型即使有偏见决策，其思维步骤未必表现出偏见。

Abstract: The impressive performance of language models is undeniable. However, the
presence of biases based on gender, race, socio-economic status, physical
appearance, and sexual orientation makes the deployment of language models
challenging. This paper studies the effect of chain-of-thought prompting, a
recent approach that studies the steps followed by the model before it
responds, on fairness. More specifically, we ask the following question:
\textit{Do biased models have biased thoughts}? To answer our question, we
conduct experiments on $5$ popular large language models using fairness metrics
to quantify $11$ different biases in the model's thoughts and output. Our
results show that the bias in the thinking steps is not highly correlated with
the output bias (less than $0.6$ correlation with a $p$-value smaller than
$0.001$ in most cases). In other words, unlike human beings, the tested models
with biased decisions do not always possess biased thoughts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为评委时可能存在自我偏见，导致对其他模型输出的评估失真，需要一种方法来区分真实性能差异与偏见。

Method: 提出统计框架，建模LLM评委对自己和其他模型输出的评分分布差异，同时考虑第三方评委（如人类）的独立评估。

Result: 实证分析发现某些模型（如GPT-4o和Claude 3.5 Sonnet）存在自我偏见和家族偏见。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM评委的潜在问题，并提供了减少偏见影响的实用建议。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can serve as judges that offer rapid and
reliable assessments of other LLM outputs. However, models may systematically
assign overly favorable ratings to their own outputs, a phenomenon known as
self-bias, which can distort evaluations of true model performance. Previous
studies often conflate genuine differences in model quality with bias or
incorrectly assume that evaluations from LLMs and humans follow the same rating
distributions. In this work, we present a statistical framework that explicitly
formalizes assumptions under which self-bias can be identified and estimated.
Our method models the difference in the scoring distribution that
LLM-as-a-judge assigns to its own completions compared to other models, while
accounting for the underlying quality of the completions provided by an
independent, third-party judge (e.g., humans). Our method reliably isolates and
quantifies self-bias, even when models vary in ability, ensuring that genuine
performance differences are not mistaken for self-bias. We conduct an empirical
analysis of self-bias on a large dataset (>5000 prompt-completion pairs)
consisting of expert human annotations and judgments from nine different LLM
judges. We find that some models, such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet,
systematically assign higher scores to their own outputs. These models also
display family-bias; systematically assigning higher ratings to outputs
produced by other models of the same family. Our findings highlight potential
pitfalls of using LLM judges and offer practical guidance to mitigate biases
when interpreting automated evaluations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种可扩展的框架，利用LLMs自动为日裔美国人拘留口述历史进行语义和情感标注，通过多阶段方法结合专家标注和模型评估，展示了LLMs在大规模口述历史分析中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 口述历史是记录系统性不公和历史抹除的重要资源，但其大规模分析因非结构化格式、情感复杂性和高标注成本而受限。

Method: 结合专家标注、提示设计和LLM评估（ChatGPT、Llama、Qwen），采用零样本、少样本和RAG策略，标注558句话并进行模型比较。

Result: ChatGPT在语义分类中表现最佳（F1 88.71%），Llama在情感分析中略优（82.66%），最终标注了92,191句话。

Conclusion: LLMs在精心设计的提示下可有效用于大规模口述历史标注，为文化遗产分析提供了可复用的流程和伦理指导。

Abstract: Oral histories are vital records of lived experience, particularly within
communities affected by systemic injustice and historical erasure. Effective
and efficient analysis of their oral history archives can promote access and
understanding of the oral histories. However, Large-scale analysis of these
archives remains limited due to their unstructured format, emotional
complexity, and high annotation costs. This paper presents a scalable framework
to automate semantic and sentiment annotation for Japanese American
Incarceration Oral History. Using LLMs, we construct a high-quality dataset,
evaluate multiple models, and test prompt engineering strategies in
historically sensitive contexts. Our multiphase approach combines expert
annotation, prompt design, and LLM evaluation with ChatGPT, Llama, and Qwen. We
labeled 558 sentences from 15 narrators for sentiment and semantic
classification, then evaluated zero-shot, few-shot, and RAG strategies. For
semantic classification, ChatGPT achieved the highest F1 score (88.71%),
followed by Llama (84.99%) and Qwen (83.72%). For sentiment analysis, Llama
slightly outperformed Qwen (82.66%) and ChatGPT (82.29%), with all models
showing comparable results. The best prompt configurations were used to
annotate 92,191 sentences from 1,002 interviews in the JAIOH collection. Our
findings show that LLMs can effectively perform semantic and sentiment
annotation across large oral history collections when guided by well-designed
prompts. This study provides a reusable annotation pipeline and practical
guidance for applying LLMs in culturally sensitive archival analysis. By
bridging archival ethics with scalable NLP techniques, this work lays the
groundwork for responsible use of artificial intelligence in digital humanities
and preservation of collective memory. GitHub:

Motivation: 现有越狱研究仅关注单轮攻击，而LLMs能处理多轮对话，因此多轮越狱可能带来更严重的安全威胁。

Method: 构建多轮越狱基准（MTJ-Bench），测试开源和闭源模型在多轮对话中的安全性。

Result: 揭示了多轮越狱的新漏洞，为模型安全性研究提供了新视角。

Conclusion: 呼吁社区共同努力提升LLMs安全性，并深入理解越狱攻击机制。

Abstract: Current jailbreaking work on large language models (LLMs) aims to elicit
unsafe outputs from given prompts. However, it only focuses on single-turn
jailbreaking targeting one specific query. On the contrary, the advanced LLMs
are designed to handle extremely long contexts and can thus conduct multi-turn
conversations. So, we propose exploring multi-turn jailbreaking, in which the
jailbroken LLMs are continuously tested on more than the first-turn
conversation or a single target query. This is an even more serious threat
because 1) it is common for users to continue asking relevant follow-up
questions to clarify certain jailbroken details, and 2) it is also possible
that the initial round of jailbreaking causes the LLMs to respond to additional
irrelevant questions consistently. As the first step (First draft done at June
2024) in exploring multi-turn jailbreaking, we construct a Multi-Turn Jailbreak
Benchmark (MTJ-Bench) for benchmarking this setting on a series of open- and
closed-source models and provide novel insights into this new safety threat. By
revealing this new vulnerability, we aim to call for community efforts to build
safer LLMs and pave the way for a more in-depth understanding of jailbreaking
LLMs.

Abstract: Sarcasm detection is a crucial yet challenging Natural Language Processing
task. Existing Large Language Model methods are often limited by
single-perspective analysis, static reasoning pathways, and a susceptibility to
hallucination when processing complex ironic rhetoric, which impacts their
accuracy and reliability. To address these challenges, we propose **SEVADE**, a
novel **S**elf-**Ev**olving multi-agent **A**nalysis framework with
**D**ecoupled **E**valuation for hallucination-resistant sarcasm detection. The
core of our framework is a Dynamic Agentive Reasoning Engine (DARE), which
utilizes a team of specialized agents grounded in linguistic theory to perform
a multifaceted deconstruction of the text and generate a structured reasoning
chain. Subsequently, a separate lightweight rationale adjudicator (RA) performs
the final classification based solely on this reasoning chain. This decoupled
architecture is designed to mitigate the risk of hallucination by separating
complex reasoning from the final judgment. Extensive experiments on four
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with average improvements of **6.75%** in Accuracy and **6.29%**
in Macro-F1 score.

Result: 开发了数据集并比较了不同系统的性能，教师评估了反馈的相关性、准确性和可理解性。

Conclusion: 改进的反馈生成方法有助于语言学习，未来可进一步优化系统设计。

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have contributed to the
development of automated writing evaluation (AWE) systems that can correct
grammatical errors. However, while these systems are effective at improving
text, they are not optimally designed for language learning. They favor direct
revisions, often with a click-to-fix functionality that can be applied without
considering the reason for the correction. Meanwhile, depending on the error
type, learners may benefit most from simple explanations and strategically
indirect hints, especially on generalizable grammatical rules. To support the
generation of such feedback, we introduce an annotation framework that models
each error's error type and generalizability. For error type classification, we
introduce a typology focused on inferring learners' knowledge gaps by
connecting their errors to specific grammatical patterns. Following this
framework, we collect a dataset of annotated learner errors and corresponding
human-written feedback comments, each labeled as a direct correction or hint.
With this data, we evaluate keyword-guided, keyword-free, and template-guided
methods of generating feedback using large language models (LLMs). Human
teachers examined each system's outputs, assessing them on grounds including
relevance, factuality, and comprehensibility. We report on the development of
the dataset and the comparative performance of the systems investigated.

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in natural language
processing. It remains a research hotspot due to its wide applicability across
domains. Although recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved
NER performance, they rely heavily on large, high-quality annotated datasets.
However, building these datasets is expensive and time-consuming, posing a
major bottleneck for further research. Current dataset merging approaches
mainly focus on strategies like manual label mapping or constructing label
graphs, which lack interpretability and scalability. To address this, we
propose an automatic label alignment method based on label similarity. The
method combines empirical and semantic similarities, using a greedy pairwise
merging strategy to unify label spaces across different datasets. Experiments
are conducted in two stages: first, merging three existing NER datasets into a
unified corpus with minimal impact on NER performance; second, integrating this
corpus with a small-scale, self-built dataset in the financial domain. The
results show that our method enables effective dataset merging and enhances NER
performance in the low-resource financial domain. This study presents an
efficient, interpretable, and scalable solution for integrating multi-source
NER corpora.

Abstract: Personal information is abundant on users' devices, from structured data in

users with answers for complex questions that involve filters, joins and
aggregation over heterogeneous sources. The unique trait of ReQAP is that it
recursively decomposes questions and incrementally builds an operator tree for
execution. Both the question interpretation and the individual operators make
smart use of light-weight language models, with judicious fine-tuning. The demo
showcases the rich functionality for advanced user questions, and also offers
detailed tracking of how the answers are computed by the operators in the
execution tree. Being able to trace answers back to the underlying sources is
vital for human comprehensibility and user trust in the system.

Result: 在PERSONA-CHAT和ConvAI2数据集上的实验表明，SBS显著提升了角色一致性对话的生成效果。

Conclusion: SBS框架通过评分条件训练，有效提升了对话模型对角色一致性的捕捉能力，优于传统训练方法。

Abstract: Persona-based dialogue generation is an important milestone towards building
conversational artificial intelligence. Despite the ever-improving capabilities
of large language models (LLMs), effectively integrating persona fidelity in
conversations remains challenging due to the limited diversity in existing
dialogue data. We propose a novel framework SBS (Score-Before-Speaking), which
outperforms previous methods and yields improvements for both million and
billion-parameter models. Unlike previous methods, SBS unifies the learning of
responses and their relative quality into a single step. The key innovation is
to train a dialogue model to correlate augmented responses with a quality score
during training and then leverage this knowledge at inference. We use
noun-based substitution for augmentation and semantic similarity-based scores
as a proxy for response quality. Through extensive experiments with benchmark
datasets (PERSONA-CHAT and ConvAI2), we show that score-conditioned training
allows existing models to better capture a spectrum of persona-consistent
dialogues. Our ablation studies also demonstrate that including scores in the
input prompt during training is superior to conventional training setups. Code

Result: 在五个数据集和多种LLM上测试，F1分数显著提升，对抗攻击和改写更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SentiDetect在检测LLM生成文本方面表现优越，具有更强的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has resulted in
increasingly sophisticated AI-generated content, posing significant challenges
in distinguishing LLM-generated text from human-written language. Existing
detection methods, primarily based on lexical heuristics or fine-tuned
classifiers, often suffer from limited generalizability and are vulnerable to
paraphrasing, adversarial perturbations, and cross-domain shifts. In this work,
we propose SentiDetect, a model-agnostic framework for detecting LLM-generated
text by analyzing the divergence in sentiment distribution stability. Our
method is motivated by the empirical observation that LLM outputs tend to
exhibit emotionally consistent patterns, whereas human-written texts display
greater emotional variability. To capture this phenomenon, we define two
complementary metrics: sentiment distribution consistency and sentiment
distribution preservation, which quantify stability under sentiment-altering
and semantic-preserving transformations. We evaluate SentiDetect on five
diverse datasets and a range of advanced LLMs,including Gemini-1.5-Pro,
Claude-3, GPT-4-0613, and LLaMa-3.3. Experimental results demonstrate its
superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, with over 16% and 11% F1 score
improvements on Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4-0613, respectively. Moreover,
SentiDetect also shows greater robustness to paraphrasing, adversarial attacks,
and text length variations, outperforming existing detectors in challenging
scenarios.

Abstract: Quranic Question Answering presents unique challenges due to the linguistic
complexity of Classical Arabic and the semantic richness of religious texts. In
this paper, we propose a novel two-stage framework that addresses both passage

Arabic language models to achieve superior ranking performance. For answer
extraction, we employ instruction-tuned large language models with few-shot
prompting to overcome the limitations of fine-tuning on small datasets. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the Quran QA 2023 Shared Task,
with a MAP@10 of 0.3128 and MRR@10 of 0.5763 for retrieval, and a pAP@10 of

results demonstrate that combining model ensembling and instruction-tuned
language models effectively addresses the challenges of low-resource question

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种规模LLM上优于现有方法，利用预训练模型实现高性能1-bit量化。

Conclusion: 通过渐进式训练和补偿技术，成功实现高性能1-bit LLM量化，显著降低训练成本。

Abstract: 1-bit LLM quantization offers significant advantages in reducing storage and
computational costs. However, existing methods typically train 1-bit LLMs from
scratch, failing to fully leverage pre-trained models. This results in high
training costs and notable accuracy degradation. We identify that the large gap
between full precision and 1-bit representations makes direct adaptation
difficult. In this paper, we introduce a consistent progressive training for
both forward and backward, smoothly converting the floating-point weights into
the binarized ones. Additionally, we incorporate binary-aware initialization
and dual-scaling compensation to reduce the difficulty of progressive training
and improve the performance. Experimental results on LLMs of various sizes
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. Our results show
that high-performance 1-bit LLMs can be achieved using pre-trained models,
eliminating the need for expensive training from scratch.

*Mao Li,Fred Conrad,Johann Gagnon-Bartsch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Vec2Summ是一种新颖的抽象摘要方法，通过语义压缩生成摘要，利用均值向量表示文档集合，并通过嵌入反转生成自然语言摘要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于LLM的摘要方法在上下文长度限制、可控性和扩展性方面的不足。

Method: 使用均值向量表示文档语义，通过高斯分布采样引入随机性，利用生成语言模型进行嵌入反转。

Result: Vec2Summ生成的主题覆盖和效率与直接LLM摘要相当，但细节较少，适用于需要扩展性和语义控制的场景。

Conclusion: Vec2Summ在扩展性、语义控制和语料库级别抽象方面具有潜力。

Abstract: We propose Vec2Summ, a novel method for abstractive summarization that frames
the task as semantic compression. Vec2Summ represents a document collection
using a single mean vector in the semantic embedding space, capturing the
central meaning of the corpus. To reconstruct fluent summaries, we perform
embedding inversion -- decoding this mean vector into natural language using a
generative language model. To improve reconstruction quality and capture some
degree of topical variability, we introduce stochasticity by sampling from a
Gaussian distribution centered on the mean. This approach is loosely analogous
to bagging in ensemble learning, where controlled randomness encourages more
robust and varied outputs. Vec2Summ addresses key limitations of LLM-based
summarization methods. It avoids context-length constraints, enables
interpretable and controllable generation via semantic parameters, and scales
efficiently with corpus size -- requiring only $O(d + d^2)$ parameters.
Empirical results show that Vec2Summ produces coherent summaries for topically
focused, order-invariant corpora, with performance comparable to direct LLM
summarization in terms of thematic coverage and efficiency, albeit with less
fine-grained detail. These results underscore Vec2Summ's potential in settings
where scalability, semantic control, and corpus-level abstraction are
prioritized.

Motivation: 现有对话数据集大多忽略文化差异，而东南亚地区文化多样性丰富，但资源匮乏。

Method: 收集了六个东南亚国家的八种语言对话，包含人物属性和文化主题。

Result: 发布了多轮对话数据集，支持文化感知和以人为本的大语言模型研究。

Conclusion: SEADialogues为文化敏感的对话系统提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Although numerous datasets have been developed to support dialogue systems,

over 700 million people and immense cultural diversity. Our dataset features
dialogues in eight languages from six Southeast Asian countries, many of which
are low-resource despite having sizable speaker populations. To enhance
cultural relevance and personalization, each dialogue includes persona
attributes and two culturally grounded topics that reflect everyday life in the
respective communities. Furthermore, we release a multi-turn dialogue dataset
to advance research on culturally aware and human-centric large language
models, including conversational dialogue agents.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了BharatBBQ，一个针对印度多语言和文化背景的偏见评估基准，填补了现有西方中心化基准的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏见评估基准（如BBQ）主要关注西方语境，缺乏对印度多语言和文化背景的适用性。

Method: 开发了BharatBBQ，涵盖8种印度语言和13个社会类别，通过翻译和验证扩展数据集。

Result: 评估显示多语言模型在印度语言中的偏见问题更严重，强调了文化适应性基准的必要性。

Conclusion: BharatBBQ为印度语境提供了更全面的偏见评估工具，揭示了语言和文化对偏见的影响。

Abstract: Evaluating social biases in language models (LMs) is crucial for ensuring
fairness and minimizing the reinforcement of harmful stereotypes in AI systems.
Existing benchmarks, such as the Bias Benchmark for Question Answering (BBQ),
primarily focus on Western contexts, limiting their applicability to the Indian
context. To address this gap, we introduce BharatBBQ, a culturally adapted
benchmark designed to assess biases in Hindi, English, Marathi, Bengali, Tamil,
Telugu, Odia, and Assamese. BharatBBQ covers 13 social categories, including 3
intersectional groups, reflecting prevalent biases in the Indian sociocultural
landscape. Our dataset contains 49,108 examples in one language that are
expanded using translation and verification to 392,864 examples in eight
different languages. We evaluate five multilingual LM families across zero and
few-shot settings, analyzing their bias and stereotypical bias scores. Our
findings highlight persistent biases across languages and social categories and
often amplified biases in Indian languages compared to English, demonstrating
the necessity of linguistically and culturally grounded benchmarks for bias
evaluation.

TL;DR: LessIsMore是一种无需训练的稀疏注意力机制，通过全局注意力模式提高推理任务的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有稀疏注意力机制在长生成推理中因累积误差导致的准确性下降问题，同时避免高令牌保留率或昂贵的重新训练需求。

Method: 利用全局注意力模式，聚合局部注意力头的令牌选择与近期上下文信息，实现跨头令牌的统一排名。

Result: 在多种推理任务中，LessIsMore保持甚至提高准确性，解码速度平均提升1.1倍，令牌关注数量减少2倍。

Conclusion: LessIsMore在效率和准确性上优于现有稀疏注意力方法，实现了端到端速度提升1.13倍。

Abstract: Large reasoning models achieve strong performance through test-time scaling
but incur substantial computational overhead, particularly from excessive token
generation when processing short input prompts. While sparse attention
mechanisms can reduce latency and memory usage, existing approaches suffer from
significant accuracy degradation due to accumulated errors during
long-generation reasoning. These methods generally require either high token
retention rates or expensive retraining. We introduce LessIsMore, a
training-free sparse attention mechanism for reasoning tasks, which leverages
global attention patterns rather than relying on traditional head-specific
local optimizations. LessIsMore aggregates token selections from local
attention heads with recent contextual information, enabling unified cross-head
token ranking for future decoding layers. This unified selection improves
generalization and efficiency by avoiding the need to maintain separate token
subsets per head. Evaluation across diverse reasoning tasks and benchmarks
shows that LessIsMore preserves -- and in some cases improves -- accuracy while
achieving a $1.1\times$ average decoding speed-up compared to full attention.
Moreover, LessIsMore attends to $2\times$ fewer tokens without accuracy loss,
achieving a $1.13\times$ end-to-end speed-up compared to existing sparse
attention methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统可能反映和加剧社会偏见，尤其是在关键社会场景中，因此需要评估LLMs的交叉性偏见。

Method: 通过扩展WinoBias数据集，创建WinoIdentity基准，评估50种交叉性偏见模式，并提出Coreference Confidence Disparity指标。

Result: 评估了五种LLMs，发现模型对某些交叉性身份的置信度差异高达40%，且对反刻板印象场景中的双重弱势身份最不确定。

Conclusion: LLMs的性能可能更多依赖记忆而非逻辑推理，存在价值对齐和有效性的双重问题，可能导致社会危害。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance, leading to
their widespread adoption as decision-support tools in resource-constrained
contexts like hiring and admissions. There is, however, scientific consensus
that AI systems can reflect and exacerbate societal biases, raising concerns
about identity-based harm when used in critical social contexts. Prior work has
laid a solid foundation for assessing bias in LLMs by evaluating demographic
disparities in different language reasoning tasks. In this work, we extend
single-axis fairness evaluations to examine intersectional bias, recognizing
that when multiple axes of discrimination intersect, they create distinct
patterns of disadvantage. We create a new benchmark called WinoIdentity by
augmenting the WinoBias dataset with 25 demographic markers across 10
attributes, including age, nationality, and race, intersected with binary
gender, yielding 245,700 prompts to evaluate 50 distinct bias patterns.
Focusing on harms of omission due to underrepresentation, we investigate bias
through the lens of uncertainty and propose a group (un)fairness metric called
Coreference Confidence Disparity which measures whether models are more or less
confident for some intersectional identities than others. We evaluate five
recently published LLMs and find confidence disparities as high as 40% along
various demographic attributes including body type, sexual orientation and
socio-economic status, with models being most uncertain about
doubly-disadvantaged identities in anti-stereotypical settings. Surprisingly,
coreference confidence decreases even for hegemonic or privileged markers,
indicating that the recent impressive performance of LLMs is more likely due to
memorization than logical reasoning. Notably, these are two independent
failures in value alignment and validity that can compound to cause social
harm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ASR系统公平性不足的问题，揭示其对社会公正的影响。

Method: 通过哲学视角分析ASR偏见，区分道德中性分类与有害歧视，并识别三个独特的伦理维度。

Result: 发现现有技术公平指标无法捕捉ASR偏见带来的不对称权力关系。

Conclusion: 解决ASR偏见需技术干预与对语言多样性的认可，以开发尊重多样性和自主性的系统。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems now mediate countless
human-technology interactions, yet research on their fairness implications
remains surprisingly limited. This paper examines ASR bias through a
philosophical lens, arguing that systematic misrecognition of certain speech
varieties constitutes more than a technical limitation -- it represents a form
of disrespect that compounds historical injustices against marginalized
linguistic communities. We distinguish between morally neutral classification
(discriminate1) and harmful discrimination (discriminate2), demonstrating how
ASR systems can inadvertently transform the former into the latter when they
consistently misrecognize non-standard dialects. We identify three unique
ethical dimensions of speech technologies that differentiate ASR bias from
other algorithmic fairness concerns: the temporal burden placed on speakers of
non-standard varieties ("temporal taxation"), the disruption of conversational
flow when systems misrecognize speech, and the fundamental connection between
speech patterns and personal/cultural identity. These factors create asymmetric
power relationships that existing technical fairness metrics fail to capture.
The paper analyzes the tension between linguistic standardization and pluralism
in ASR development, arguing that current approaches often embed and reinforce
problematic language ideologies. We conclude that addressing ASR bias requires
more than technical interventions; it demands recognition of diverse speech
varieties as legitimate forms of expression worthy of technological
accommodation. This philosophical reframing offers new pathways for developing
ASR systems that respect linguistic diversity and speaker autonomy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全微调方法对恶意样本比例敏感，防御效果随比例增加急剧下降，原因是用户任务梯度与安全目标冲突。

Method: 提出SafeGrad方法，检测梯度冲突时，将用户任务梯度的有害分量投影到对齐梯度的正交平面，并采用KL散度对齐损失增强鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明SafeGrad在各种LLM和数据集上提供最先进的防御，即使在高恶意比例下也能保持安全性和任务保真度。

Conclusion: SafeGrad通过梯度手术有效解决了安全微调中的冲突问题，为LLM的安全对齐提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning-as-a-Service introduces a critical vulnerability where a few
malicious examples mixed into the user's fine-tuning dataset can compromise the
safety alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs). While a recognized paradigm
frames safe fine-tuning as a multi-objective optimization problem balancing
user task performance with safety alignment, we find existing solutions are
critically sensitive to the harmful ratio, with defenses degrading sharply as
harmful ratio increases. We diagnose that this failure stems from conflicting
gradients, where the user-task update directly undermines the safety objective.
To resolve this, we propose SafeGrad, a novel method that employs gradient
surgery. When a conflict is detected, SafeGrad nullifies the harmful component
of the user-task gradient by projecting it onto the orthogonal plane of the
alignment gradient, allowing the model to learn the user's task without
sacrificing safety. To further enhance robustness and data efficiency, we
employ a KL-divergence alignment loss that learns the rich, distributional
safety profile of the well-aligned foundation model. Extensive experiments show
that SafeGrad provides state-of-the-art defense across various LLMs and
datasets, maintaining robust safety even at high harmful ratios without
compromising task fidelity.

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个全面的多模态大语言模型（OLLM）安全评估基准Omni-SafetyBench，填补了现有评估工具的空白，并揭示了当前OLLM在安全性和跨模态一致性上的显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏专门针对OLLM的安全评估基准，且现有基准无法评估多模态联合输入或跨模态安全一致性，作者开发了Omni-SafetyBench以解决这一问题。

Method: 设计了包含24种模态组合的基准，每组合972个样本，并提出了基于条件攻击成功率（C-ASR）、拒绝率（C-RR）和跨模态安全一致性评分（CMSC-score）的评估指标。

Result: 评估10个OLLM发现：1）无模型在安全性和一致性上均表现优异；2）复杂输入（尤其是视听联合）削弱安全防御；3）某些模态下模型得分低至0.14。

Conclusion: 研究强调了提升OLLM安全性的紧迫性，为未来改进提供了基础。

Abstract: The rise of Omni-modal Large Language Models (OLLMs), which integrate visual
and auditory processing with text, necessitates robust safety evaluations to
mitigate harmful outputs. However, no dedicated benchmarks currently exist for
OLLMs, and prior benchmarks designed for other LLMs lack the ability to assess
safety performance under audio-visual joint inputs or cross-modal safety
consistency. To fill this gap, we introduce Omni-SafetyBench, the first
comprehensive parallel benchmark for OLLM safety evaluation, featuring 24
modality combinations and variations with 972 samples each, including dedicated
audio-visual harm cases. Considering OLLMs' comprehension challenges with
complex omni-modal inputs and the need for cross-modal consistency evaluation,
we propose tailored metrics: a Safety-score based on conditional Attack Success
Rate (C-ASR) and Refusal Rate (C-RR) to account for comprehension failures, and
a Cross-Modal Safety Consistency Score (CMSC-score) to measure consistency
across modalities. Evaluating 6 open-source and 4 closed-source OLLMs reveals
critical vulnerabilities: (1) no model excels in both overall safety and
consistency, with only 3 models achieving over 0.6 in both metrics and top
performer scoring around 0.8; (2) safety defenses weaken with complex inputs,
especially audio-visual joints; (3) severe weaknesses persist, with some models
scoring as low as 0.14 on specific modalities. Our benchmark and metrics
highlight urgent needs for enhanced OLLM safety, providing a foundation for
future improvements.

Motivation: 现有方法忽略了历史点击流中的噪声，导致生成的标题偏离用户真实兴趣。

Method: 采用双阶段过滤去除噪声（短停留时间和异常点击），并通过多级时间融合动态建模用户兴趣。

Result: PHG-DIF在DT-PENS数据集上实现了SOTA结果，显著提升了标题质量。

Conclusion: PHG-DIF有效解决了点击噪声问题，为个性化标题生成提供了新方法。

Abstract: Accurate personalized headline generation hinges on precisely capturing user
interests from historical behaviors. However, existing methods neglect
personalized-irrelevant click noise in entire historical clickstreams, which
may lead to hallucinated headlines that deviate from genuine user preferences.
In this paper, we reveal the detrimental impact of click noise on personalized
generation quality through rigorous analysis in both user and news dimensions.
Based on these insights, we propose a novel Personalized Headline Generation
framework via Denoising Fake Interests from Implicit Feedback (PHG-DIF).
PHG-DIF first employs dual-stage filtering to effectively remove clickstream
noise, identified by short dwell times and abnormal click bursts, and then
leverages multi-level temporal fusion to dynamically model users' evolving and
multi-faceted interests for precise profiling. Moreover, we release DT-PENS, a
new benchmark dataset comprising the click behavior of 1,000 carefully curated
users and nearly 10,000 annotated personalized headlines with historical dwell
time annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PHG-DIF substantially
mitigates the adverse effects of click noise and significantly improves
headline quality, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on DT-PENS. Our
framework implementation and dataset are available at

Method: 提出自动化提取框架，识别源模式、源表、转换逻辑和聚合操作，创建标准化数据转换表示。引入SLiCE评估指标和1,700条手动标注的基准数据集。

Result: 实验表明，模式谱系提取性能随模型规模和提示技术复杂度的提升而提升。32B开源模型在单次推理中表现接近GPT系列。

Conclusion: 研究为实际应用中部署模式感知代理提供了一种可扩展且经济的方法。

Abstract: Enterprise data pipelines, characterized by complex transformations across
multiple programming languages, often cause a semantic disconnect between
original metadata and downstream data. This "semantic drift" compromises data
reproducibility and governance, and impairs the utility of services like
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and text-to-SQL systems. To address this,
a novel framework is proposed for the automated extraction of fine-grained
schema lineage from multilingual enterprise pipeline scripts. This method
identifies four key components: source schemas, source tables, transformation
logic, and aggregation operations, creating a standardized representation of
data transformations. For the rigorous evaluation of lineage quality, this
paper introduces the Schema Lineage Composite Evaluation (SLiCE), a metric that
assesses both structural correctness and semantic fidelity. A new benchmark is
also presented, comprising 1,700 manually annotated lineages from real-world
industrial scripts. Experiments were conducted with 12 language models, from
1.3B to 32B small language models (SLMs) to large language models (LLMs) like
GPT-4o and GPT-4.1. The results demonstrate that the performance of schema
lineage extraction scales with model size and the sophistication of prompting
techniques. Specially, a 32B open-source model, using a single reasoning trace,
can achieve performance comparable to the GPT series under standard prompting.
This finding suggests a scalable and economical approach for deploying
schema-aware agents in practical applications.

Result: 在时效性问答任务中，DySK-Attn 在准确性和计算效率上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DySK-Attn 提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，使大语言模型能够实时更新知识。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from a critical limitation: their
knowledge is static and quickly becomes outdated. Retraining these massive
models is computationally prohibitive, while existing knowledge editing
techniques can be slow and may introduce unforeseen side effects. To address
this, we propose DySK-Attn, a novel framework that enables LLMs to efficiently
integrate real-time knowledge from a dynamic external source. Our approach
synergizes an LLM with a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) that can be updated
instantaneously. The core of our framework is a sparse knowledge attention
mechanism, which allows the LLM to perform a coarse-to-fine grained search,
efficiently identifying and focusing on a small, highly relevant subset of
facts from the vast KG. This mechanism avoids the high computational cost of
dense attention over the entire knowledge base and mitigates noise from
irrelevant information. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on
time-sensitive question-answering tasks that DySK-Attn significantly
outperforms strong baselines, including standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) and model editing techniques, in both factual accuracy for updated
knowledge and computational efficiency. Our framework offers a scalable and
effective solution for building LLMs that can stay current with the
ever-changing world.

Result: 在七个真实数据集上表现优异，MSE平均提升11%。

Conclusion: TALON证明了结合模式感知和语义感知设计对LLM时间序列预测的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive
capabilities in natural language processing due to their strong generalization
and sequence modeling capabilities. However, their direct application to time
series forecasting remains challenging due to two fundamental issues: the
inherent heterogeneity of temporal patterns and the modality gap between
continuous numerical signals and discrete language representations. In this
work, we propose TALON, a unified framework that enhances LLM-based forecasting
by modeling temporal heterogeneity and enforcing semantic alignment.
Specifically, we design a Heterogeneous Temporal Encoder that partitions
multivariate time series into structurally coherent segments, enabling
localized expert modeling across diverse temporal patterns. To bridge the
modality gap, we introduce a Semantic Alignment Module that aligns temporal
features with LLM-compatible representations, enabling effective integration of
time series into language-based models while eliminating the need for
handcrafted prompts during inference. Extensive experiments on seven real-world
benchmarks demonstrate that TALON achieves superior performance across all
datasets, with average MSE improvements of up to 11\% over recent
state-of-the-art methods. These results underscore the effectiveness of
incorporating both pattern-aware and semantic-aware designs when adapting LLMs
for time series forecasting. The code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PLM在社交媒体任务（如谣言检测）中表现不佳，原因是预训练语料与社交文本不匹配、未能有效处理社交符号，以及预训练任务未建模传播结构中的用户互动。

Method: 提出PEP策略，通过预测帖子间关系（根、分支、父级）来捕捉传播结构中的立场和情感互动，并训练了一个针对Twitter的PLM（SoLM）。

Result: PEP显著提升了谣言检测性能，在基准数据集上比基线模型提高了1.0-3.7%的准确率，甚至优于当前最优方法。SoLM也取得了竞争性结果。

Conclusion: PEP策略能有效学习帖子互动的判别性特征，显著提升PLM在社交媒体任务中的表现。

Abstract: Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) have excelled in various Natural Language
Processing tasks, benefiting from large-scale pretraining and self-attention
mechanism's ability to capture long-range dependencies. However, their
performance on social media application tasks like rumor detection remains
suboptimal. We attribute this to mismatches between pretraining corpora and
social texts, inadequate handling of unique social symbols, and pretraining
tasks ill-suited for modeling user engagements implicit in propagation
structures. To address these issues, we propose a continue pretraining strategy
called Post Engagement Prediction (PEP) to infuse information from propagation
structures into PLMs. PEP makes models to predict root, branch, and parent
relations between posts, capturing interactions of stance and sentiment crucial
for rumor detection. We also curate and release large-scale Twitter corpus:
TwitterCorpus (269GB text), and two unlabeled claim conversation datasets with
propagation structures (UTwitter and UWeibo). Utilizing these resources and PEP
strategy, we train a Twitter-tailored PLM called SoLM. Extensive experiments
demonstrate PEP significantly boosts rumor detection performance across
universal and social media PLMs, even in few-shot scenarios. On benchmark
datasets, PEP enhances baseline models by 1.0-3.7\% accuracy, even enabling it
to outperform current state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets. SoLM
alone, without high-level modules, also achieves competitive results,
highlighting the strategy's effectiveness in learning discriminative post
interaction features.

Method: 构建了一个英语双音节词数据集，训练多个CNN架构预测重音位置，并使用LRP技术分析模型决策依据。

Result: 模型在测试数据上达到92%的准确率，LRP显示预测主要依赖重音音节的频谱特性（如第一和第二共振峰），但也关注整个词的信息。

Conclusion: 研究表明深度学习能从自然数据中学习分布式的重音线索，扩展了传统语音学基于高度控制刺激的研究。

Abstract: Despite their success in speech processing, neural networks often operate as
black boxes, prompting the question: what informs their decisions, and how can
we interpret them? This work examines this issue in the context of lexical
stress. A dataset of English disyllabic words was automatically constructed
from read and spontaneous speech. Several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
architectures were trained to predict stress position from a spectrographic
representation of disyllabic words lacking minimal stress pairs (e.g., initial
stress WAllet, final stress exTEND), achieving up to 92% accuracy on held-out
test data. Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP), a technique for CNN
interpretability analysis, revealed that predictions for held-out minimal pairs
(PROtest vs. proTEST ) were most strongly influenced by information in stressed
versus unstressed syllables, particularly the spectral properties of stressed
vowels. However, the classifiers also attended to information throughout the
word. A feature-specific relevance analysis is proposed, and its results
suggest that our best-performing classifier is strongly influenced by the
stressed vowel's first and second formants, with some evidence that its pitch
and third formant also contribute. These results reveal deep learning's ability
to acquire distributed cues to stress from naturally occurring data, extending
traditional phonetic work based around highly controlled stimuli.

*Zhe Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于提示调优和记忆演示模板的方法，解决了Few-Shot CLNER任务中的Few-Shot Distillation Dilemma问题，提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在Few-Shot CLNER任务中，新类别实体稀缺导致模型泛化能力差，且旧类别信息不足阻碍知识蒸馏，引发Few-Shot Distillation Dilemma。

Method: 设计了可扩展的Anchor words-oriented Prompt Tuning (APT)范式，并结合Memory Demonstration Templates (MDT)提供历史任务样本。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在FS-CLNER任务中取得了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 通过APT和MDT策略，有效解决了Few-Shot Distillation Dilemma，并提升了Few-Shot CLNER任务的性能。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation has been successfully applied to Continual Learning
Named Entity Recognition (CLNER) tasks, by using a teacher model trained on
old-class data to distill old-class entities present in new-class data as a
form of regularization, thereby avoiding catastrophic forgetting. However, in
Few-Shot CLNER (FS-CLNER) tasks, the scarcity of new-class entities makes it
difficult for the trained model to generalize during inference. More
critically, the lack of old-class entity information hinders the distillation
of old knowledge, causing the model to fall into what we refer to as the
Few-Shot Distillation Dilemma. In this work, we address the above challenges
through a prompt tuning paradigm and memory demonstration template strategy.
Specifically, we designed an expandable Anchor words-oriented Prompt Tuning
(APT) paradigm to bridge the gap between pre-training and fine-tuning, thereby
enhancing performance in few-shot scenarios. Additionally, we incorporated
Memory Demonstration Templates (MDT) into each training instance to provide
replay samples from previous tasks, which not only avoids the Few-Shot
Distillation Dilemma but also promotes in-context learning. Experiments show
that our approach achieves competitive performances on FS-CLNER.

*Bernd J. Kröger*

TL;DR: 扩展了二维动态发音模型DYNARTmo，通过集成三维腭穹表示，从矢状舌轮廓估计舌-腭接触区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进发音模型以更准确地模拟舌-腭接触，支持语音科学教育和治疗。

Method: 实现两种腭穹几何（半椭圆和余弦曲线），分析计算侧向接触点，生成类似电子腭图的2D+可视化。

Result: 模型支持三种同步视图（矢状、声门和腭部），适用于静态和动态发音展示。

Conclusion: 未来工作包括添加唇部视图和实现发音-声学合成，以定量评估模型真实性。

Abstract: This paper describes an extension of the two-dimensional dynamic articulatory
model DYNARTmo by integrating an internal three-dimensional representation of
the palatal dome to estimate tongue-palate contact areas from midsagittal
tongue contours. Two alternative dome geometries - a half-ellipse and a cosine
based profile - are implemented to model lateral curvature in the coronal
plane. Using these geometries, lateral contact points are analytically computed
for each anterior-posterior position, enabling the generation of
electropalatography-like visualizations within the 2D+ framework. The enhanced
model supports three synchronized views (sagittal, glottal, and palatal) for
static and dynamic (animated) articulation displays, suitable for speech
science education and speech therapy. Future work includes adding a facial
(lip) view and implementing articulatory-to-acoustic synthesis to
quantitatively evaluate model realism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音大模型在共情推理上表现不足，因缺乏结合上下文和副语言信息的训练数据。

Method: 1. 显式方法：直接提供副语言元数据（如情感标注）给模型。2. 隐式方法：自动生成结合情感标注和语音转录的训练QA对。

Result: 隐式方法性能提升38.41%，结合显式方法达46.02%。LLM评判结果与分类指标相关，验证其可靠性。

Conclusion: 结合显式和隐式方法能有效提升语音语言模型的副语言理解能力。

Abstract: Current large speech language models (Speech-LLMs) often exhibit limitations
in empathetic reasoning, primarily due to the absence of training datasets that
integrate both contextual content and paralinguistic cues. In this work, we
propose two approaches to incorporate contextual paralinguistic information
into model training: (1) an explicit method that provides paralinguistic
metadata (e.g., emotion annotations) directly to the LLM, and (2) an implicit
method that automatically generates novel training question-answer (QA) pairs
using both categorical and dimensional emotion annotations alongside speech
transcriptions. Our implicit method boosts performance (LLM-judged) by 38.41%
on a human-annotated QA benchmark, reaching 46.02% when combined with the
explicit approach, showing effectiveness in contextual paralinguistic
understanding. We also validate the LLM judge by demonstrating its correlation
with classification metrics, providing support for its reliability.

TL;DR: MAQuA是一种自适应提问框架，用于高效的多维心理健康筛查，通过优化提问顺序显著减少问题数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行心理健康评估时，频繁提问会增加用户负担且效率低下，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 结合多结果建模、项目反应理论（IRT）和因子分析，动态选择最具信息量的问题。

Result: MAQuA将问题数量减少50-87%，并在多个心理健康领域表现稳健。

Conclusion: MAQuA为LLM在临床工作流中的集成提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for
scalable, interactive mental health assessment, but excessive querying by LLMs
burdens users and is inefficient for real-world screening across
transdiagnostic symptom profiles. We introduce MAQuA, an adaptive
question-asking framework for simultaneous, multidimensional mental health
screening. Combining multi-outcome modeling on language responses with item
response theory (IRT) and factor analysis, MAQuA selects the questions with
most informative responses across multiple dimensions at each turn to optimize
diagnostic information, improving accuracy and potentially reducing response
burden. Empirical results on a novel dataset reveal that MAQuA reduces the
number of assessment questions required for score stabilization by 50-87%
compared to random ordering (e.g., achieving stable depression scores with 71%
fewer questions and eating disorder scores with 85% fewer questions). MAQuA
demonstrates robust performance across both internalizing (depression, anxiety)
and externalizing (substance use, eating disorder) domains, with early stopping
strategies further reducing patient time and burden. These findings position
MAQuA as a powerful and efficient tool for scalable, nuanced, and interactive
mental health screening, advancing the integration of LLM-based agents into
real-world clinical workflows.

Motivation: 随着LLM在伦理敏感决策中的作用增强，理解其道德推理过程变得至关重要。

Method: 采用因子提示协议，收集了3,780个二元决策和自然语言解释，分析决策果断性、解释一致性、公共道德对齐及对无关伦理线索的敏感性。

Result: 推理增强模型更果断且解释更结构化，但未必更符合人类共识；在利他、公平和美德伦理框架下表现较好，而在亲属、法律或自利框架下易产生争议。

Conclusion: 建议将道德推理作为LLM对齐的主要维度，并建立标准化基准，评估其决策过程和原因。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate ethically sensitive
decisions, understanding their moral reasoning processes becomes imperative.
This study presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of 14 leading LLMs,
both reasoning enabled and general purpose, across 27 diverse trolley problem
scenarios, framed by ten moral philosophies, including utilitarianism,
deontology, and altruism. Using a factorial prompting protocol, we elicited
3,780 binary decisions and natural language justifications, enabling analysis
along axes of decisional assertiveness, explanation answer consistency, public
moral alignment, and sensitivity to ethically irrelevant cues. Our findings
reveal significant variability across ethical frames and model types: reasoning
enhanced models demonstrate greater decisiveness and structured justifications,
yet do not always align better with human consensus. Notably, "sweet zones"
emerge in altruistic, fairness, and virtue ethics framings, where models
achieve a balance of high intervention rates, low explanation conflict, and
minimal divergence from aggregated human judgments. However, models diverge
under frames emphasizing kinship, legality, or self interest, often producing
ethically controversial outcomes. These patterns suggest that moral prompting
is not only a behavioral modifier but also a diagnostic tool for uncovering
latent alignment philosophies across providers. We advocate for moral reasoning
to become a primary axis in LLM alignment, calling for standardized benchmarks
that evaluate not just what LLMs decide, but how and why.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AEC领域NER任务中预训练模型因领域术语和复杂关系导致的性能受限问题，避免高成本的人工标注数据。

Method: 使用LLM生成简单解释性知识（Cote），并用其增量预训练RoBERTa模型，再进行下游任务微调。

Result: 在AEC基准数据集上达到77.20%的Macro-F1分数，表现优于复杂角色推理。

Conclusion: 简单解释性知识比复杂推理更有效，ARCE为领域特定NER任务提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate information extraction from specialized texts is a critical
challenge, particularly for named entity recognition (NER) in the architecture,
engineering, and construction (AEC) domain to support automated rule checking
(ARC). The performance of standard pre-trained models is often constrained by
the domain gap, as they struggle to interpret the specialized terminology and
complex relational contexts inherent in AEC texts. Although this issue can be
mitigated by further pre-training on large, human-curated domain corpora, as
exemplified by methods like ARCBERT, this approach is both labor-intensive and
cost-prohibitive. Consequently, leveraging large language models (LLMs) for
automated knowledge generation has emerged as a promising alternative. However,
the optimal strategy for generating knowledge that can genuinely enhance
smaller, efficient models remains an open question. To address this, we propose
ARCE (augmented RoBERTa with contextualized elucidations), a novel approach
that systematically explores and optimizes this generation process. ARCE
employs an LLM to first generate a corpus of simple, direct explanations, which
we term Cote, and then uses this corpus to incrementally pre-train a RoBERTa
model prior to its fine-tuning on the downstream task. Our extensive
experiments show that ARCE establishes a new state-of-the-art on a benchmark
AEC dataset, achieving a Macro-F1 score of 77.20%. This result also reveals a
key finding: simple, explanation-based knowledge proves surprisingly more
effective than complex, role-based rationales for this task. The code is
publicly available at:https://github.com/nxcc-lab/ARCE.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种跨语言和跨模态的事实性基准（CCFQA），用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在多语言语音输入中的可靠性，并展示了当前模型的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注英语文本或视觉模态，缺乏对多语言语音输入的事实性评估，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 设计了包含8种语言的平行语音-文本事实性问题基准（CCFQA），并提出了一种少样本迁移学习策略，将英语问答能力迁移到多语言口语问答任务。

Result: 实验表明当前MLLMs在CCFQA上仍面临挑战，但提出的方法仅用5-shot训练即可达到与GPT-4o-mini-Audio竞争的性能。

Conclusion: CCFQA为促进MLLMs在多语言语音理解能力上的发展提供了基础资源。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly popularized in the
multilingual world, ensuring hallucination-free factuality becomes markedly
crucial. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating the reliability of
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) predominantly focus on textual or
visual modalities with a primary emphasis on English, which creates a gap in
evaluation when processing multilingual input, especially in speech. To bridge
this gap, we propose a novel \textbf{C}ross-lingual and \textbf{C}ross-modal
\textbf{F}actuality benchmark (\textbf{CCFQA}). Specifically, the CCFQA
benchmark contains parallel speech-text factual questions across 8 languages,
designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs' cross-lingual and cross-modal
factuality capabilities. Our experimental results demonstrate that current
MLLMs still face substantial challenges on the CCFQA benchmark. Furthermore, we
propose a few-shot transfer learning strategy that effectively transfers the
Question Answering (QA) capabilities of LLMs in English to multilingual Spoken
Question Answering (SQA) tasks, achieving competitive performance with
GPT-4o-mini-Audio using just 5-shot training. We release CCFQA as a
foundational research resource to promote the development of MLLMs with more
robust and reliable speech understanding capabilities. Our code and dataset are

studies across 17 healthcare topics, each data point is based on clinically
validated reasoning chains. HealthBranches supports both open-ended and
multiple-choice question formats and uniquely includes the full reasoning path
for each Q&A. Its structured design enables robust evaluation of LLMs'
multi-step inference capabilities, including their performance in structured
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) contexts. HealthBranches establishes a
foundation for the development of more trustworthy, interpretable, and
clinically reliable LLMs in high-stakes domains while also serving as a

Motivation: 现有研究未测试LLMs在模糊化问题下的表现，因此需要系统评估其局限性。

Method: 提出ObfusQAte技术，构建ObfusQA框架，通过三个维度（命名实体间接、干扰项间接、上下文过载）测试LLMs。

Result: LLMs在复杂语言变化下表现不佳，易生成虚假回答。

Conclusion: ObfusQA为评估LLMs鲁棒性提供了全面基准，并公开了ObfusQAte以促进相关研究。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly
contributed to the development of equitable AI systems capable of factual
question-answering (QA). However, no known study tests the LLMs' robustness
when presented with obfuscated versions of questions. To systematically
evaluate these limitations, we propose a novel technique, ObfusQAte and,
leveraging the same, introduce ObfusQA, a comprehensive, first of its kind,
framework with multi-tiered obfuscation levels designed to examine LLM
capabilities across three distinct dimensions: (i) Named-Entity Indirection,
(ii) Distractor Indirection, and (iii) Contextual Overload. By capturing these
fine-grained distinctions in language, ObfusQA provides a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating LLM robustness and adaptability. Our study observes
that LLMs exhibit a tendency to fail or generate hallucinated responses when
confronted with these increasingly nuanced variations. To foster research in
this direction, we make ObfusQAte publicly available.

Motivation: 理解代码切换语言的特征及其在双语使用中的影响。

Method: 开发能完成地图任务的代码切换聊天机器人，并通过两种实验策略测试其效果。

Result: 参与者喜欢可预测的代码切换行为，对随机或不符语法的切换反应消极。

Conclusion: 未充分开发的多语言技术可能带来负面影响，但也为双语研究提供了潜力。

Abstract: Most people are multilingual, and most multilinguals code-switch, yet the
characteristics of code-switched language are not fully understood. We
developed a chatbot capable of completing a Map Task with human participants
using code-switched Spanish and English. In two experiments, we prompted the
bot to code-switch according to different strategies, examining (1) the
feasibility of such experiments for investigating bilingual language use, and
(2) whether participants would be sensitive to variations in discourse and
grammatical patterns. Participants generally enjoyed code-switching with our
bot as long as it produced predictable code-switching behavior; when
code-switching was random or ungrammatical (as when producing unattested
incongruent mixed-language noun phrases, such as `la fork'), participants
enjoyed the task less and were less successful at completing it. These results
underscore the potential downsides of deploying insufficiently developed
multilingual language technology, while also illustrating the promise of such
technology for conducting research on bilingual language use.

Conclusion: TurnGuide有效解决了FD-SLMs的挑战，提升了语音交互的自然性和语义连贯性。

Abstract: Full-Duplex Speech Language Models (FD-SLMs) are specialized foundation
models designed to enable natural, real-time spoken interactions by modeling
complex conversational dynamics such as interruptions, backchannels, and
overlapping speech, and End-to-end (e2e) FD-SLMs leverage real-world
double-channel conversational data to capture nuanced two-speaker dialogue
patterns for human-like interactions. However, they face a critical challenge
-- their conversational abilities often degrade compared to pure-text
conversation due to prolonged speech sequences and limited high-quality spoken
dialogue data. While text-guided speech generation could mitigate these issues,
it suffers from timing and length issues when integrating textual guidance into
double-channel audio streams, disrupting the precise time alignment essential
for natural interactions. To address these challenges, we propose TurnGuide, a
novel planning-inspired approach that mimics human conversational planning by
dynamically segmenting assistant speech into dialogue turns and generating
turn-level text guidance before speech output, which effectively resolves both
insertion timing and length challenges. Extensive experiments demonstrate our
approach significantly improves e2e FD-SLMs' conversational abilities, enabling
them to generate semantically meaningful and coherent speech while maintaining
natural conversational flow. Demos are available at

<details>

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在高资源环境下表现优异，但在低资源语言和文化实体上表现不佳，存在文化鸿沟。

Method: 利用Wikidata知识图谱收集文化实体图像，生成多语言视觉问答数据，构建CulturalGround数据集，并训练模型CulturalPangea。

Result: CulturalPangea在文化相关的多语言多模态任务上表现最优，平均提升5.0分，且不影响主流视觉语言任务性能。

Conclusion: 针对文化知识的针对性方法能有效缩小多模态大语言模型的文化鸿沟，推动全球包容性多模态系统的发展。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models excel in high-resource settings, but often
misinterpret long-tail cultural entities and underperform in low-resource
languages. To address this gap, we propose a data-centric approach that
directly grounds MLLMs in cultural knowledge. Leveraging a large scale
knowledge graph from Wikidata, we collect images that represent culturally
significant entities, and generate synthetic multilingual visual question
answering data. The resulting dataset, CulturalGround, comprises 22 million
high-quality, culturally-rich VQA pairs spanning 42 countries and 39 languages.
We train an open-source MLLM CulturalPangea on CulturalGround, interleaving
standard multilingual instruction-tuning data to preserve general abilities.
CulturalPangea achieves state-of-the-art performance among open models on
various culture-focused multilingual multimodal benchmarks, outperforming prior
models by an average of 5.0 without degrading results on mainstream
vision-language tasks. Our findings show that our targeted, culturally grounded
approach could substantially narrow the cultural gap in MLLMs and offer a
practical path towards globally inclusive multimodal systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在代码生成中面临的效率、可扩展性以及奖励信号不明确等问题。

Method: 提出ReLoc框架，包含初始代码起草、邻域代码生成、候选评估和代码更新四个组件，并开发了专门的修订奖励模型。

Result: 实验表明ReLoc在多种代码生成任务中表现优异，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ReLoc为代码生成提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with inference-time scaling techniques show
promise for code generation, yet face notable efficiency and scalability
challenges. Construction-based tree-search methods suffer from rapid growth in
tree size, high token consumption, and lack of anytime property. In contrast,
improvement-based methods offer better performance but often struggle with
uninformative reward signals and inefficient search strategies. In this work,
we propose \textbf{ReLoc}, a unified local search framework which effectively
performs step-by-step code revision. Specifically, ReLoc explores a series of
local revisions through four key algorithmic components: initial code drafting,
neighborhood code generation, candidate evaluation, and incumbent code
updating, each of which can be instantiated with specific decision rules to
realize different local search algorithms such as Hill Climbing (HC) or Genetic
Algorithm (GA). Furthermore, we develop a specialized revision reward model
that evaluates code quality based on revision distance to produce fine-grained
preferences that guide the local search toward more promising candidates.
Finally, our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach
achieves superior performance across diverse code generation tasks,
significantly outperforming both construction-based tree search as well as the
state-of-the-art improvement-based code generation methods.

TL;DR: 研究发现，大语言模型（LLMs）在长输入中存在位置偏差，如“中间迷失”（LiM）效应，且LiM效应在输入占模型上下文窗口50%时最强。超过50%时，首因效应减弱，而近因效应稳定，最终表现为距离偏差。此外，检索能力是LLMs推理的前提，位置偏差主要源于检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在长输入中的位置偏差（如LiM效应）的强度和表现条件，以改进长上下文任务和评估方法。

Method: 通过相对输入长度（相对于模型上下文窗口）进行综合分析，研究位置偏差的变化。

Result: LiM效应在输入占50%上下文窗口时最强；超过50%时，首因效应减弱，近因效应稳定，表现为距离偏差。检索能力是推理的前提，位置偏差源于检索。

Conclusion: 研究为长上下文任务设计、LLM基准测试和评估方法提供了重要启示，强调了检索对推理的关键作用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to use information across long
inputs effectively. Prior work has identified positional biases, such as the
Lost in the Middle (LiM) effect, where models perform better when information
appears at the beginning (primacy bias) or end (recency bias) of the input,
rather than in the middle. However, long-context studies have not consistently
replicated these effects, raising questions about their intensity and the
conditions under which they manifest. To address this, we conducted a
comprehensive analysis using relative rather than absolute input lengths,
defined with respect to each model's context window. Our findings reveal that
the LiM effect is strongest when inputs occupy up to 50% of a model's context
window. Beyond that, the primacy bias weakens, while recency bias remains
relatively stable. This effectively eliminates the LiM effect; instead, we
observe a distance-based bias, where model performance is better when relevant
information is closer to the end of the input. Furthermore, our results suggest
that successful retrieval is a prerequisite for reasoning in LLMs, and that the
observed positional biases in reasoning are largely inherited from retrieval.
These insights have implications for long-context tasks, the design of future
LLM benchmarks, and evaluation methodologies for LLMs handling extended inputs.

*Archchana Sindhujan,Shenbin Qian,Chan Chi Chun Matthew,Constantin Orasan,Diptesh Kanojia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ALOPE是一种自适应层优化框架，通过调整Transformer层的表示来提升基于LLM的机器翻译质量估计（QE）性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的QE系统因预训练目标和回归任务不匹配，以及在低资源语言上的局限性，表现不佳。

Method: ALOPE结合低秩适配器（LoRA）和回归任务头，动态加权多层表示，并采用多头回归策略。

Result: ALOPE在多种LLM-based QE方法中表现更优，中间层表示更适合跨语言QE任务。

Conclusion: ALOPE为LLM-based QE提供了有效解决方案，并公开了模型和代码以促进研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across a wide
range of natural language processing tasks. Quality Estimation (QE) for Machine
Translation (MT), which assesses the quality of a source-target pair without
relying on reference translations, remains a challenging cross-lingual task for
LLMs. The challenges stem from the inherent limitations of existing LLM-based
QE systems, which are pre-trained for causal language modelling rather than
regression-specific tasks, further elevated by the presence of low-resource
languages given pre-training data distribution. This paper introduces ALOPE, an
adaptive layer-optimization framework designed to enhance LLM-based QE by
restructuring Transformer representations through layer-wise adaptation for
improved regression-based prediction. Our framework integrates low-rank
adapters (LoRA) with regression task heads, leveraging selected pre-trained
Transformer layers for improved cross-lingual alignment. In addition to the
layer-specific adaptation, ALOPE introduces two strategies-dynamic weighting,
which adaptively combines representations from multiple layers, and multi-head
regression, which aggregates regression losses from multiple heads for QE. Our
framework shows improvements over various existing LLM-based QE approaches.
Empirical evidence suggests that intermediate Transformer layers in LLMs
provide contextual representations that are more aligned with the cross-lingual
nature of the QE task. We make resultant models and framework code publicly
available for further research, also allowing existing LLM-based MT frameworks
to be scaled with QE capabilities.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于拓扑数据分析的方法，用于识别GPT-2中导致对特定群体偏见的注意力头。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能明确大型语言模型中哪些部分对特定群体的偏见负责。

Method: 使用拓扑数据分析方法，识别GPT-2中导致偏见的注意力头。

Result: 发现偏见集中在某些注意力头中，这些头成为热点。

Conclusion: 提出的方法可用于识别特定群体的偏见，未来可用于去偏大型语言模型。

Abstract: Recently, many bias detection methods have been proposed to determine the
level of bias a large language model captures. However, tests to identify which
parts of a large language model are responsible for bias towards specific
groups remain underdeveloped. In this study, we present a method using
topological data analysis to identify which heads in GPT-2 contribute to the
misrepresentation of identity groups present in the StereoSet dataset. We find
that biases for particular categories, such as gender or profession, are
concentrated in attention heads that act as hot spots. The metric we propose
can also be used to determine which heads capture bias for a specific group
within a bias category, and future work could extend this method to help
de-bias large language models.

*Joseph T. Colonel,Baihan Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ThemeClouds是一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的开源可视化工具，用于生成主题词云，解决了传统频率词云在对话场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统频率词云在对话场景中效果不佳，无法捕捉语义关联且容易受填充词干扰，研究者需要更快速、可解释的对话摘要工具。

Method: ThemeClouds利用LLM识别对话中的概念级主题，并统计每个主题被提及的参与者数量，生成基于提及广度的词云。

Result: 与频率词云和主题建模基线（如LDA、BERTopic）相比，ThemeClouds能更有效地提取用户研究中的设备问题。

Conclusion: ThemeClouds为定性工作流提供了透明且可控的LLM辅助工具，同时探讨了交互式分析的潜力。

Abstract: Word clouds are a common way to summarize qualitative interviews, yet
traditional frequency-based methods often fail in conversational contexts: they
surface filler words, ignore paraphrase, and fragment semantically related
ideas. This limits their usefulness in early-stage analysis, when researchers
need fast, interpretable overviews of what participant actually said. We
introduce ThemeClouds, an open-source visualization tool that uses large
language models (LLMs) to generate thematic, participant-weighted word clouds
from dialogue transcripts. The system prompts an LLM to identify concept-level
themes across a corpus and then counts how many unique participants mention
each topic, yielding a visualization grounded in breadth of mention rather than
raw term frequency. Researchers can customize prompts and visualization
parameters, providing transparency and control. Using interviews from a user
study comparing five recording-device configurations (31 participants; 155
transcripts, Whisper ASR), our approach surfaces more actionable device
concerns than frequency clouds and topic-modeling baselines (e.g., LDA,
BERTopic). We discuss design trade-offs for integrating LLM assistance into
qualitative workflows, implications for interpretability and researcher agency,
and opportunities for interactive analyses such as per-condition contrasts
(``diff clouds'').

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了RLVR中LLMs的探索能力，包括探索空间塑造、熵-性能交换和RL性能优化，旨在为RLVR系统提供基础框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL方法在LLMs的复杂推理链生成和优化中依赖规则反馈，但探索行为的机制尚未深入研究。

Method: 研究探索空间塑造、熵-性能交换及RL性能优化，结合定量指标和新实证证据。

Result: 提出了LLMs探索能力的量化指标，分析了熵与性能的关系，并优化了RL性能。

Conclusion: 为RLVR系统的进一步发展提供了理论基础和实证支持。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). Unlike traditional RL approaches, RLVR leverages rule-based
feedback to guide LLMs in generating and refining complex reasoning chains -- a
process critically dependent on effective exploration strategies. While prior
work has demonstrated RLVR's empirical success, the fundamental mechanisms
governing LLMs' exploration behaviors remain underexplored. This technical
report presents a systematic investigation of exploration capacities in RLVR,
covering four main aspects: (1) exploration space shaping, where we develop
quantitative metrics to characterize LLMs' capability boundaries; (2)
entropy-performance exchange, analyzed across training stages, individual
instances, and token-level patterns; and (3) RL performance optimization,
examining methods to effectively translate exploration gains into measurable
improvements. By unifying previously identified insights with new empirical
evidence, this work aims to provide a foundational framework for advancing RLVR
systems.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了印度保释预测系统（IBPS），一种基于AI的框架，旨在通过预测结果和生成法律依据来辅助保释决策，以减少主观性和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度法院的保释决策存在主观性、延迟和不一致问题，75%的监狱人口为未审判囚犯，加剧人权问题和司法积压。

Method: 构建包含15万条高等法院保释判决的数据集，利用参数高效技术微调大语言模型，并结合法律条文评估性能。

Result: 结合法律知识的模型表现显著优于基线，具有高准确性和解释质量，并能泛化到专家标注的测试集。

Conclusion: IBPS为印度司法系统提供了透明、可扩展的解决方案，支持数据驱动的法律辅助，减少保释延迟并促进程序公平。

Abstract: Bail decisions are among the most frequently adjudicated matters in Indian
courts, yet they remain plagued by subjectivity, delays, and inconsistencies.
With over 75% of India's prison population comprising undertrial prisoners,
many from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, the lack of timely and
fair bail adjudication exacerbates human rights concerns and contributes to
systemic judicial backlog. In this paper, we present the Indian Bail Prediction
System (IBPS), an AI-powered framework designed to assist in bail
decision-making by predicting outcomes and generating legally sound rationales
based solely on factual case attributes and statutory provisions. We curate and
release a large-scale dataset of 150,430 High Court bail judgments, enriched
with structured annotations such as age, health, criminal history, crime
category, custody duration, statutes, and judicial reasoning. We fine-tune a
large language model using parameter-efficient techniques and evaluate its
performance across multiple configurations, with and without statutory context,
and with RAG. Our results demonstrate that models fine-tuned with statutory
knowledge significantly outperform baselines, achieving strong accuracy and
explanation quality, and generalize well to a test set independently annotated
by legal experts. IBPS offers a transparent, scalable, and reproducible
solution to support data-driven legal assistance, reduce bail delays, and
promote procedural fairness in the Indian judicial system.

*Ziheng Li,Zhi-Hong Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出KeyCP++方法，通过关键词驱动的思维链提示改进LLM在事件检测任务中的表现，解决传统上下文学习的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在事件检测中因对触发词理解不准确和过度解释而表现不佳，传统上下文学习无法有效纠正。

Method: KeyCP++通过自动标注输入文本与检测结果间的逻辑空白，构建触发词判别提示模板，生成深入且有意义的推理。

Result: 实验证明KeyCP++在单样本事件检测中显著提升性能。

Conclusion: KeyCP++通过关键词驱动的推理链有效缓解LLM对关键词的过度依赖，促进检测规则学习。

Abstract: Although the LLM-based in-context learning (ICL) paradigm has demonstrated
considerable success across various natural language processing tasks, it
encounters challenges in event detection. This is because LLMs lack an accurate
understanding of event triggers and tend to make over-interpretation, which
cannot be effectively corrected through in-context examples alone. In this
paper, we focus on the most challenging one-shot setting and propose KeyCP++, a
keyword-centric chain-of-thought prompting approach. KeyCP++ addresses the
weaknesses of conventional ICL by automatically annotating the logical gaps
between input text and detection results for the demonstrations. Specifically,
to generate in-depth and meaningful rationale, KeyCP++ constructs a trigger
discrimination prompting template. It incorporates the exemplary triggers
(a.k.a keywords) into the prompt as the anchor to simply trigger profiling, let
LLM propose candidate triggers, and justify each candidate. These
propose-and-judge rationales help LLMs mitigate over-reliance on the keywords
and promote detection rule learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, showcasing significant advancements in one-shot
event detection.

TL;DR: InterChart是一个评估视觉语言模型在多图表推理任务中表现的诊断基准，涵盖从简单事实推理到复杂语义推理的三个难度层级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注单一图表，而InterChart旨在解决多图表推理任务，以模拟科学报告、金融分析等实际应用场景。

Method: 通过设计三种难度层级（事实推理、整合分析和语义推理），评估模型在不同复杂度的多图表任务中的表现。

Result: 评估显示，随着图表复杂度增加，模型准确率显著下降，且模型在分解多实体图表时表现更好。

Conclusion: InterChart揭示了模型在多图表集成推理中的局限性，为复杂多视觉环境中的多模态推理提供了严格框架。

Abstract: We introduce InterChart, a diagnostic benchmark that evaluates how well
vision-language models (VLMs) reason across multiple related charts, a task
central to real-world applications such as scientific reporting, financial
analysis, and public policy dashboards. Unlike prior benchmarks focusing on
isolated, visually uniform charts, InterChart challenges models with diverse
question types ranging from entity inference and trend correlation to numerical
estimation and abstract multi-step reasoning grounded in 2-3 thematically or
structurally related charts. We organize the benchmark into three tiers of
increasing difficulty: (1) factual reasoning over individual charts, (2)
integrative analysis across synthetically aligned chart sets, and (3) semantic
inference over visually complex, real-world chart pairs. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art open and closed-source VLMs reveals consistent and steep
accuracy declines as chart complexity increases. We find that models perform
better when we decompose multi-entity charts into simpler visual units,
underscoring their struggles with cross-chart integration. By exposing these
systematic limitations, InterChart provides a rigorous framework for advancing
multimodal reasoning in complex, multi-visual environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LoSemB的逻辑引导语义桥接框架，用于解决大语言模型在工具学习中处理未见工具时的分布偏移和相似性检索脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的工具库不断更新，现有方法假设所有工具在训练时已观察到，导致处理未见工具时效果不佳。

Method: LoSemB框架包含逻辑嵌入对齐模块和关系增强检索机制，以挖掘和转移潜在逻辑信息。

Result: 实验表明，LoSemB在归纳设置中表现优异，同时在转导设置中保持良好效果。

Conclusion: LoSemB为工具学习中的归纳检索提供了一种高效且无需重新训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Tool learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for large language models
(LLMs) to solve many real-world tasks. Nonetheless, with the tool repository
rapidly expanding, it is impractical to contain all tools within the limited
input length of LLMs. To alleviate these issues, researchers have explored
incorporating a tool retrieval module to select the most relevant tools or
represent tools as unique tokens within LLM parameters. However, most
state-of-the-art methods are under transductive settings, assuming all tools
have been observed during training. Such a setting deviates from reality as the
real-world tool repository is evolving and incorporates new tools frequently.
When dealing with these unseen tools, which refer to tools not encountered
during the training phase, these methods are limited by two key issues,
including the large distribution shift and the vulnerability of
similarity-based retrieval. To this end, inspired by human cognitive processes
of mastering unseen tools through discovering and applying the logical
information from prior experience, we introduce a novel Logic-Guided Semantic
Bridging framework for inductive tool retrieval, namely, LoSemB, which aims to
mine and transfer latent logical information for inductive tool retrieval
without costly retraining. Specifically, LoSemB contains a logic-based
embedding alignment module to mitigate distribution shifts and implements a
relational augmented retrieval mechanism to reduce the vulnerability of
similarity-based retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoSemB
achieves advanced performance in inductive settings while maintaining desirable
effectiveness in the transductive setting.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了基于Transformer的模型在长距离连贯性上的不足，通过掩码句子预测任务评估了商业LLM的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究NTP（下一词预测）在长距离连贯性上的局限性，探索LLM在全局一致性任务中的能力。

Method: 评估GPT-4o、Claude 3.5 Sonnet和Gemini 2.0 Flash在掩码句子预测任务中的表现，涵盖叙事、程序和说明性文本。

Result: 商业LLM在低结构化领域的掩码句子预测表现较差。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在全局一致性任务中存在能力缺口。

Abstract: Transformer-based models primarily rely on Next Token Prediction (NTP), which
predicts the next token in a sequence based on the preceding context. However,
NTP's focus on single-token prediction often limits a model's ability to plan
ahead or maintain long-range coherence, raising questions about how well LLMs
can predict longer contexts, such as full sentences within structured
documents. While NTP encourages local fluency, it provides no explicit
incentive to ensure global coherence across sentence boundaries-an essential
skill for reconstructive or discursive tasks. To investigate this, we evaluate
three commercial LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) on
Masked Sentence Prediction (MSP) - the task of infilling a randomly removed
sentence - from three domains: ROCStories (narrative), Recipe1M (procedural),
and Wikipedia (expository). We assess both fidelity (similarity to the original
sentence) and cohesiveness (fit within the surrounding context). Our key
finding reveals that commercial LLMs, despite their superlative performance in
other tasks, are poor at predicting masked sentences in low-structured domains,
highlighting a gap in current model capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在多种任务中表现优异，但其输出与输入不一致的忠实性幻觉问题尚未解决，且社会偏见是否导致此类幻觉未被探索。

Method: 使用SCM建立因果关系，设计偏见干预措施控制混杂因素，并开发偏见干预数据集（BID）进行精确测量。

Result: 实验表明偏见是忠实性幻觉的重要原因，且不同偏见状态的影响方向各异。

Conclusion: 偏见对幻觉生成具有微妙但显著的因果影响，尤其在针对社会偏见的不公平幻觉中表现明显。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various
tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to faithfulness hallucinations, where the
output does not align with the input. In this study, we investigate whether
social bias contributes to these hallucinations, a causal relationship that has
not been explored. A key challenge is controlling confounders within the
context, which complicates the isolation of causality between bias states and
hallucinations. To address this, we utilize the Structural Causal Model (SCM)
to establish and validate the causality and design bias interventions to
control confounders. In addition, we develop the Bias Intervention Dataset
(BID), which includes various social biases, enabling precise measurement of
causal effects. Experiments on mainstream LLMs reveal that biases are
significant causes of faithfulness hallucinations, and the effect of each bias
state differs in direction. We further analyze the scope of these causal
effects across various models, specifically focusing on unfairness
hallucinations, which are primarily targeted by social bias, revealing the
subtle yet significant causal effect of bias on hallucination generation.

Abstract: This work proposes a grammar-based chunking strategy that segments input
streams into semantically complete units by parsing dependency relations (e.g.,
noun phrase boundaries, verb-object structures) and punctuation features. The
method ensures chunk coherence and minimizes semantic fragmentation. Building
on this mechanism, we present SASST (Syntax-Aware Simultaneous Speech
Translation), an end-to-end framework integrating frozen Whisper encoder and
decoder-only LLM. The unified architecture dynamically outputs translation
tokens or <WAIT> symbols to jointly optimize translation timing and content,
with target-side reordering addressing word-order divergence. Experiments on

Conclusion: Grove MoE通过异质化专家和动态激活，显著提升了计算效率和模型性能。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture is a cornerstone of modern
state-of-the-art (SOTA) large language models (LLMs). MoE models facilitate
scalability by enabling sparse parameter activation. However, traditional MoE
architecture uses homogeneous experts of a uniform size, activating a fixed
number of parameters irrespective of input complexity and thus limiting
computational efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Grove MoE,
a novel architecture incorporating experts of varying sizes, inspired by the
heterogeneous big.LITTLE CPU architecture. This architecture features novel
adjugate experts with a dynamic activation mechanism, enabling model capacity
expansion while maintaining manageable computational overhead. Building on this
architecture, we present GroveMoE-Base and GroveMoE-Inst, 33B-parameter LLMs
developed by applying an upcycling strategy to the Qwen3-30B-A3B-Base model
during mid-training and post-training. GroveMoE models dynamically activate
3.14-3.28B parameters based on token complexity and achieve performance
comparable to SOTA open-source models of similar or even larger size.

Motivation: 探究LLM作为自动评分员时，是否会被说服性语言操纵评分，揭示其潜在漏洞。

Method: 基于亚里士多德的修辞原则，定义了七种说服技巧，并将其嵌入数学任务的回答中，测试LLM评分的偏差。

Result: 说服性语言导致LLM对错误答案评分平均提高8%，模型规模增大无法显著缓解此问题。

Conclusion: LLM评分易受说服性语言影响，需开发防御机制以应对此类攻击。

Abstract: As large language models take on growing roles as automated evaluators in
practical settings, a critical question arises: Can individuals persuade an LLM
judge to assign unfairly high scores? This study is the first to reveal that
strategically embedded persuasive language can bias LLM judges when scoring
mathematical reasoning tasks, where correctness should be independent of
stylistic variation. Grounded in Aristotle's rhetorical principles, we
formalize seven persuasion techniques (Majority, Consistency, Flattery,
Reciprocity, Pity, Authority, Identity) and embed them into otherwise identical
responses. Across six math benchmarks, we find that persuasive language leads
LLM judges to assign inflated scores to incorrect solutions, by up to 8% on
average, with Consistency causing the most severe distortion. Notably,
increasing model size does not substantially mitigate this vulnerability.
Further analysis demonstrates that combining multiple persuasion techniques
amplifies the bias, and pairwise evaluation is likewise susceptible. Moreover,
the persuasive effect persists under counter prompting strategies, highlighting
a critical vulnerability in LLM-as-a-Judge pipelines and underscoring the need
for robust defenses against persuasion-based attacks.

Motivation: 研究动机在于填补语言学中焦点分析（FA）缺乏定量评估的空白，并探索SA的组合规则是否适用于FA，因为两者密切相关。

Method: 采用基于通用依存关系（UDs）的组合方法，利用修改、协调和否定等基本句法规则，对情感词典中的词进行组合分析。

Conclusion: 结论认为组合方法不仅适用于SA，还可推广到FA，且研究使用了更合适的数据集来评估组合性。

Abstract: This paper summarizes the results of evaluating a compositional approach for
Focus Analysis (FA) in Linguistics and Sentiment Analysis (SA) in Natural
Language Processing (NLP). While quantitative evaluations of compositional and
non-compositional approaches in SA exist in NLP, similar quantitative
evaluations are very rare in FA in Linguistics that deal with linguistic
expressions representing focus or emphasis such as "it was John who left". We
fill this gap in research by arguing that compositional rules in SA also apply
to FA because FA and SA are closely related meaning that SA is part of FA. Our
compositional approach in SA exploits basic syntactic rules such as rules of
modification, coordination, and negation represented in the formalism of
Universal Dependencies (UDs) in English and applied to words representing
sentiments from sentiment dictionaries. Some of the advantages of our
compositional analysis method for SA in contrast to non-compositional analysis
methods are interpretability and explainability. We test the accuracy of our
compositional approach and compare it with a non-compositional approach VADER
that uses simple heuristic rules to deal with negation, coordination and
modification. In contrast to previous related work that evaluates
compositionality in SA on long reviews, this study uses more appropriate
datasets to evaluate compositionality. In addition, we generalize the results
of compositional approaches in SA to compositional approaches in FA.

Abstract: Textual data annotation, the process of labeling or tagging text with
relevant information, is typically costly, time-consuming, and labor-intensive.
While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential as direct
alternatives to human annotators for general domains natural language
processing (NLP) tasks, their effectiveness on annotation tasks in domains
requiring expert knowledge remains underexplored. In this paper, we
investigate: whether top-performing LLMs, which might be perceived as having
expert-level proficiency in academic and professional benchmarks, can serve as
direct alternatives to human expert annotators? To this end, we evaluate both
individual LLMs and multi-agent approaches across three highly specialized
domains: finance, biomedicine, and law. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent
discussion framework to simulate a group of human annotators, where LLMs are
tasked to engage in discussions by considering others' annotations and
justifications before finalizing their labels. Additionally, we incorporate
reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) to enable a more comprehensive comparison. Our
empirical results reveal that: (1) Individual LLMs equipped with inference-time
techniques (e.g., chain-of-thought (CoT), self-consistency) show only marginal
or even negative performance gains, contrary to prior literature suggesting
their broad effectiveness. (2) Overall, reasoning models do not demonstrate
statistically significant improvements over non-reasoning models in most
settings. This suggests that extended long CoT provides relatively limited
benefits for data annotation in specialized domains. (3) Certain model
behaviors emerge in the multi-agent discussion environment. For instance,
Claude 3.7 Sonnet with thinking rarely changes its initial annotations, even
when other agents provide correct annotations or valid reasoning.

TL;DR: 对10种法律专用LLM和7种通用LLM在合同理解任务上的评估显示，法律专用模型表现更优，尤其在需要法律细微理解的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补法律NLP领域对合同分类任务中法律专用LLM全面评估的空白。

Method: 评估10种法律专用LLM和7种通用LLM在三个英语合同理解任务上的表现。

Result: 法律专用LLM（如Legal-BERT和Contracts-BERT）在多数任务中优于通用LLM，且参数更少。

Conclusion: 法律专用LLM在合同理解任务中表现卓越，为开发更精准的系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Despite advances in legal NLP, no comprehensive evaluation covering multiple
legal-specific LLMs currently exists for contract classification tasks in
contract understanding. To address this gap, we present an evaluation of 10
legal-specific LLMs on three English language contract understanding tasks and
compare them with 7 general-purpose LLMs. The results show that legal-specific
LLMs consistently outperform general-purpose models, especially on tasks
requiring nuanced legal understanding. Legal-BERT and Contracts-BERT establish
new SOTAs on two of the three tasks, despite having 69% fewer parameters than
the best-performing general-purpose LLM. We also identify CaseLaw-BERT and
LexLM as strong additional baselines for contract understanding. Our results
provide a holistic evaluation of legal-specific LLMs and will facilitate the
development of more accurate contract understanding systems.

Motivation: 探索大语言模型在捷克语ABSA任务中的潜力，填补相关研究空白。

Method: 对19种LLMs在零样本、少样本和微调场景下的表现进行综合评估，分析多语言性、模型规模和时效性等因素的影响。

Result: 领域专用小模型在零样本和少样本场景中表现更优，微调后的LLMs达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 研究为捷克语ABSA任务中LLMs的应用提供了指导，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained sentiment analysis
task that aims to identify sentiment toward specific aspects of an entity.
While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in various
natural language processing (NLP) tasks, their capabilities for Czech ABSA
remain largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation
of 19 LLMs of varying sizes and architectures on Czech ABSA, comparing their
performance in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios. Our results show
that small domain-specific models fine-tuned for ABSA outperform
general-purpose LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot settings, while fine-tuned LLMs
achieve state-of-the-art results. We analyze how factors such as
multilingualism, model size, and recency influence performance and present an
error analysis highlighting key challenges, particularly in aspect term
prediction. Our findings provide insights into the suitability of LLMs for
Czech ABSA and offer guidance for future research in this area.

*Jakub Šmíd,Pavel Přibáň,Pavel Král*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了在低资源语言中，通过添加少量目标语言示例提升跨语言方面情感分析（ABSA）性能的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管ABSA在英语中已得到广泛研究，但低资源语言因标注数据稀缺而面临挑战。现有跨语言方法依赖外部翻译工具，忽视了少量目标语言示例的潜在优势。

Method: 评估了在四种ABSA任务、六种目标语言和两种序列到序列模型中，添加少量目标语言示例对训练集的影响。

Result: 仅添加十个目标语言示例即可显著提升零样本性能，效果与约束解码相当；结合1000个目标语言示例甚至能超越单语言基线。

Conclusion: 研究表明，获取少量高质量标注示例既可行又高效，为低资源和特定领域跨语言ABSA提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has received substantial attention in
English, yet challenges remain for low-resource languages due to the scarcity
of labelled data. Current cross-lingual ABSA approaches often rely on external
translation tools and overlook the potential benefits of incorporating a small
number of target language examples into training. In this paper, we evaluate
the effect of adding few-shot target language examples to the training set
across four ABSA tasks, six target languages, and two sequence-to-sequence
models. We show that adding as few as ten target language examples
significantly improves performance over zero-shot settings and achieves a
similar effect to constrained decoding in reducing prediction errors.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that combining 1,000 target language examples with
English data can even surpass monolingual baselines. These findings offer
practical insights for improving cross-lingual ABSA in low-resource and
domain-specific settings, as obtaining ten high-quality annotated examples is
both feasible and highly effective.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了CultureCare数据集，用于研究LLMs在提供文化敏感情感支持方面的能力，并测试了四种适应策略。结果显示，经过调整的LLMs表现优于匿名在线同伴，但简单的文化角色扮演不足以实现文化敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在提供文化敏感情感支持方面的潜力，填补现有资源不足的空白。

Method: 引入CultureCare数据集，开发四种适应策略，评估三种先进LLMs的表现，结合LLM评委、文化内人类注释者和临床心理学家的综合评估。

Result: 调整后的LLMs表现优于匿名在线同伴，但简单的文化角色扮演不足以实现文化敏感性。LLMs在临床培训中显示出潜力。

Conclusion: LLMs在提供文化敏感情感支持方面具有潜力，但需要更复杂的适应策略，且在临床培训中可能有助于培养文化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in offering emotional support and
generating empathetic responses for individuals in distress, but their ability
to deliver culturally sensitive support remains underexplored due to lack of
resources. In this work, we introduce CultureCare, the first dataset designed
for this task, spanning four cultures and including 1729 distress messages,
1523 cultural signals, and 1041 support strategies with fine-grained emotional
and cultural annotations. Leveraging CultureCare, we (i) develop and test four
adaptation strategies for guiding three state-of-the-art LLMs toward culturally
sensitive responses; (ii) conduct comprehensive evaluations using LLM judges,
in-culture human annotators, and clinical psychologists; (iii) show that
adapted LLMs outperform anonymous online peer responses, and that simple
cultural role-play is insufficient for cultural sensitivity; and (iv) explore
the application of LLMs in clinical training, where experts highlight their
potential in fostering cultural competence in future therapists.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种直观的双参数表示法，用于控制手语虚拟角色Paula的情感非手动信号，通过EASIER符号实现更一致的情感表达。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手语虚拟角色在情感非手动信号方面缺乏标准化的表达方法，导致情感内容难以融入。

Method: 采用双参数表示法，通过EASIER符号控制虚拟角色的情感面部表情。

Result: 该方法能够更一致地指定情感非手动信号，并支持更细腻的情感状态表达。

Conclusion: 双参数表示法为手语虚拟角色的情感表达提供了一种更连贯的解决方案。

Abstract: Non-manual signals in sign languages continue to be a challenge for signing
avatars. More specifically, emotional content has been difficult to incorporate
because of a lack of a standard method of specifying the avatar's emotional
state. This paper explores the application of an intuitive two-parameter
representation for emotive non-manual signals to the Paula signing avatar that
shows promise for facilitating the linguistic specification of emotional facial
expressions in a more coherent manner than previous methods. Users can apply
these parameters to control Paula's emotional expressions through a textual
representation called the EASIER notation. The representation can allow avatars
to express more nuanced emotional states using two numerical parameters. It
also has the potential to enable more consistent specification of emotional
non-manual signals in linguistic annotations which drive signing avatars.

TL;DR: 论文提出了GREP框架，用于评估自动生成的科学写作质量，尤其是相关工作部分，结合专家偏好和领域标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动评估指标和LLM评委无法准确捕捉专家偏好和领域质量标准，需填补这一空白以支持人机协作写作。

Method: 提出GREP多轮评估框架，分解评估为细粒度维度，结合对比示例提供详细指导，并设计两种变体（专有和开源LLM）。

Result: GREP比标准LLM评委更稳健，与专家评估强相关，但当前LLM生成内容难以满足要求且难以通过反馈改进。

Conclusion: GREP为科学写作质量评估提供了有效工具，但LLM生成内容仍需进一步优化。

Abstract: Expert domain writing, such as scientific writing, typically demands
extensive domain knowledge. Recent advances in LLMs show promising potential in
reducing the expert workload. However, evaluating the quality of automatically
generated scientific writing is a crucial open issue, as it requires knowledge
of domain-specific evaluation criteria and the ability to discern expert
preferences. Conventional automatic metrics and LLM-as-a-judge systems are
insufficient to grasp expert preferences and domain-specific quality standards.
To address this gap and support human-AI collaborative writing, we focus on
related work generation, one of the most challenging scientific tasks, as an
exemplar. We propose GREP, a multi-turn evaluation framework that integrates
classical related work evaluation criteria with expert-specific preferences.
Instead of assigning a single score, our framework decomposes the evaluation
into fine-grained dimensions. This localized evaluation approach is further
augmented with contrastive few-shot examples to provide detailed contextual
guidance for the evaluation dimensions. The design principles allow our
framework to deliver cardinal assessment of quality, which can facilitate
better post-training compared to ordinal preference data. For better
accessibility, we design two variants of GREP: a more precise variant with
proprietary LLMs as evaluators, and a cheaper alternative with open-weight
LLMs. Empirical investigation reveals that our framework is able to assess the
quality of related work sections in a much more robust manner compared to
standard LLM judges, reflects natural scenarios of scientific writing, and
bears a strong correlation with the human expert assessment. We also observe
that generations from state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to satisfy validation
constraints of a suitable related work section. They (mostly) fail to improve
based on feedback as well.

Conclusion: LLMs在主观语言任务中表现优异，但仍需解决数据限制、模型偏见等问题，未来研究应关注统一模型和伦理问题。

Abstract: Subjective language understanding refers to a broad set of natural language
processing tasks where the goal is to interpret or generate content that
conveys personal feelings, opinions, or figurative meanings rather than
objective facts. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) such as
ChatGPT, LLaMA, and others, there has been a paradigm shift in how we approach
these inherently nuanced tasks. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive
review of recent advances in applying LLMs to subjective language tasks,
including sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, sarcasm detection, humor
understanding, stance detection, metaphor interpretation, intent detection, and
aesthetics assessment. We begin by clarifying the definition of subjective
language from linguistic and cognitive perspectives, and we outline the unique
challenges posed by subjective language (e.g. ambiguity, figurativeness,
context dependence). We then survey the evolution of LLM architectures and
techniques that particularly benefit subjectivity tasks, highlighting why LLMs
are well-suited to model subtle human-like judgments. For each of the eight
tasks, we summarize task definitions, key datasets, state-of-the-art LLM-based
methods, and remaining challenges. We provide comparative insights, discussing
commonalities and differences among tasks and how multi-task LLM approaches
might yield unified models of subjectivity. Finally, we identify open issues
such as data limitations, model bias, and ethical considerations, and suggest
future research directions. We hope this survey will serve as a valuable
resource for researchers and practitioners interested in the intersection of
affective computing, figurative language processing, and large-scale language
models.

Conclusion: 研究为缩小语音翻译系统与真实口译的差距提供了灵感，推动机器口译的发展。

Abstract: Current speech translation systems, while having achieved impressive
accuracies, are rather static in their behavior and do not adapt to real-world
situations in ways human interpreters do. In order to improve their practical
usefulness and enable interpreting-like experiences, a precise understanding of
the nature of human interpreting is crucial. To this end, we discuss human
interpreting literature from the perspective of the machine translation field,
while considering both operational and qualitative aspects. We identify
implications for the development of speech translation systems and argue that
there is great potential to adopt many human interpreting principles using
recent modeling techniques. We hope that our findings provide inspiration for
closing the perceived usability gap, and can motivate progress toward true
machine interpreting.

TL;DR: 本文研究了三种结构诱导语言模型（SiLM）的性能，发现它们在语法表示、语法判断任务和训练动态方面各有优劣，其中GPST表现最稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SiLM模型的评估规模较小且缺乏可比性，因此本文旨在系统比较三种SiLM架构的性能。

Method: 使用英语语料和合成括号表达式评估Structformer、UDGN和GPST三种模型，重点关注语法表示、语法判断任务和训练动态。

Result: GPST在长距离依赖任务中表现最佳，且小型模型在合成数据上的训练为评估提供了有效测试平台。

Conclusion: 不同SiLM架构各有优势，GPST表现最稳定，合成数据训练的小模型有助于基础模型评估。

Abstract: Structure-inducing Language Models (SiLM) are trained on a self-supervised
language modeling task, and induce a hierarchical sentence representation as a
byproduct when processing an input. A wide variety of SiLMs have been proposed.
However, these have typically been evaluated on a relatively small scale, and
evaluation of these models has systematic gaps and lacks comparability. In this
work, we study three different SiLM architectures using both natural language
(English) corpora and synthetic bracketing expressions: Structformer (Shen et
al., 2021), UDGN (Shen et al., 2022) and GPST (Hu et al., 2024). We compare
them with respect to (i) properties of the induced syntactic representations
(ii) performance on grammaticality judgment tasks, and (iii) training dynamics.
We find that none of the three architectures dominates across all evaluation
metrics. However, there are significant differences, in particular with respect
to the induced syntactic representations. The Generative Pretrained Structured
Transformer (GPST; Hu et al. 2024) performs most consistently across evaluation
settings, and outperforms the other models on long-distance dependencies in
bracketing expressions. Furthermore, our study shows that small models trained
on large amounts of synthetic data provide a useful testbed for evaluating
basic model properties.

Motivation: 现有开源智能体在搜索智能（如处理模糊查询、精确搜索和分析结果）方面表现不足，且现有RL方法因轮次限制无法学习复杂策略。

Method: 提出ASearcher，采用可扩展的异步RL训练和基于提示的LLM智能体，生成高质量QA数据集。

Conclusion: ASearcher通过简单设计和无外部LLM支持，性能超越现有32B开源智能体，相关资源已开源。

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLM-based agents have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in handling complex, knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating
external tools. Among diverse choices of tools, search tools play a pivotal
role in accessing vast external knowledge. However, open-source agents still
fall short of achieving expert-level Search Intelligence, the ability to
resolve ambiguous queries, generate precise searches, analyze results, and
conduct thorough exploration. Existing approaches fall short in scalability,
efficiency, and data quality. For example, small turn limits in existing online
RL methods, e.g. <=10, restrict complex strategy learning. This paper
introduces ASearcher, an open-source project for large-scale RL training of
search agents. Our key contributions include: (1) Scalable fully asynchronous
RL training that enables long-horizon search while maintaining high training
efficiency. (2) A prompt-based LLM agent that autonomously synthesizes
high-quality and challenging QAs, creating a large-scale QA dataset. Through RL
training, our prompt-based QwQ-32B agent achieves substantial improvements,
with 46.7% and 20.8% Avg@4 gains on xBench and GAIA, respectively. Notably, our
agent exhibits extreme long-horizon search, with tool calls exceeding 40 turns
and output tokens exceeding 150k during training time. With a simple agent
design and no external LLMs, ASearcher-Web-QwQ achieves Avg@4 scores of 42.1 on
xBench and 52.8 on GAIA, surpassing existing open-source 32B agents. We
open-source our models, training data, and codes in

Abstract: Metaphor is a fundamental cognitive mechanism that shapes scientific
understanding, enabling the communication of complex concepts while potentially
constraining paradigmatic thinking. Despite the prevalence of figurative
language in scientific discourse, existing metaphor detection resources
primarily focus on general-domain text, leaving a critical gap for
domain-specific applications. In this paper, we present the Medical Metaphors
Corpus (MCC), a comprehensive dataset of 792 annotated scientific conceptual
metaphors spanning medical and biological domains. MCC aggregates metaphorical
expressions from diverse sources including peer-reviewed literature, news
media, social media discourse, and crowdsourced contributions, providing both
binary and graded metaphoricity judgments validated through human annotation.
Each instance includes source-target conceptual mappings and perceived
metaphoricity scores on a 0-7 scale, establishing the first annotated resource
for computational scientific metaphor research. Our evaluation demonstrates
that state-of-the-art language models achieve modest performance on scientific
metaphor detection, revealing substantial room for improvement in
domain-specific figurative language understanding. MCC enables multiple
research applications including metaphor detection benchmarking, quality-aware
generation systems, and patient-centered communication tools.

Conclusion: 当前搜索代理在大规模信息收集中表现不佳，需进一步研究改进；公开了数据集和评估流程。

Abstract: From professional research to everyday planning, many tasks are bottlenecked
by wide-scale information seeking, which is more repetitive than cognitively
complex. With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), automated
search agents powered by LLMs offer a promising solution to liberate humans
from this tedious work. However, the capability of these agents to perform such
"wide-context" collection reliably and completely remains largely unevaluated
due to a lack of suitable benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce
WideSearch, a new benchmark engineered to evaluate agent reliability on these
large-scale collection tasks. The benchmark features 200 manually curated
questions (100 in English, 100 in Chinese) from over 15 diverse domains,
grounded in real user queries. Each task requires agents to collect large-scale
atomic information, which could be verified one by one objectively, and arrange
it into a well-organized output. A rigorous five-stage quality control pipeline
ensures the difficulty, completeness, and verifiability of the dataset. We
benchmark over 10 state-of-the-art agentic search systems, including
single-agent, multi-agent frameworks, and end-to-end commercial systems. Most
systems achieve overall success rates near 0\%, with the best performer
reaching just 5\%. However, given sufficient time, cross-validation by multiple
human testers can achieve a near 100\% success rate. These results demonstrate
that present search agents have critical deficiencies in large-scale
information seeking, underscoring urgent areas for future research and
development in agentic search. Our dataset, evaluation pipeline, and benchmark
results have been publicly released at https://widesearch-seed.github.io/

Motivation: 现有方法在扩展模型深度时忽略神经元排列差异，导致性能下降。

Method: 使用最优传输对齐和融合相邻基础层的Transformer块，创建新层。

Result: OpT-DeUS在持续预训练和监督微调中表现优于现有方法，且训练效率更高。

Conclusion: 新层插入靠近顶部时，训练效率更高且性能提升更显著。

Abstract: Scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) yields performance gains but incurs
substantial training costs. Depth up-scaling offers training efficiency by
adding new layers to pre-trained models. However, most existing methods copy or
average weights from base layers, neglecting neuron permutation differences.
This limitation can potentially cause misalignment that harms performance.
Inspired by applying Optimal Transport (OT) for neuron alignment, we propose
Optimal Transport Depth Up-Scaling (OpT-DeUS). OpT-DeUS aligns and fuses
Transformer blocks in adjacent base layers via OT for new layer creation, to
mitigate neuron permutation mismatch between layers. OpT-DeUS achieves better
overall performance and offers improved training efficiency than existing
methods for continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning across different
model sizes. To further evaluate the impact of interpolation positions, our
extensive analysis shows that inserting new layers closer to the top results in
higher training efficiency due to shorter back-propagation time while obtaining
additional performance gains.

Result: 在情感对话任务中表现出竞争性性能，有效整合了副语言和语言信息。

Conclusion: 该方法通过解耦信息和高效训练策略，提升了SLM在副语言和上下文理解上的表现。

Abstract: Conversational systems relying on text-based large language models (LLMs)
often overlook paralinguistic cues, essential for understanding emotions and
intentions. Speech-language models (SLMs), which use speech as input, are
emerging as a promising solution. However, SLMs built by extending frozen LLMs
struggle to capture paralinguistic information and exhibit reduced context
understanding. We identify entangled information and improper training
strategies as key issues. To address these issues, we propose two heterogeneous
adapters and suggest a weakly supervised training strategy. Our approach
disentangles paralinguistic and linguistic information, enabling SLMs to
interpret speech through structured representations. It also preserves
contextual understanding by avoiding the generation of task-specific vectors
through controlled randomness. This approach trains only the adapters on common
datasets, ensuring parameter and data efficiency. Experiments demonstrate
competitive performance in emotional conversation tasks, showcasing the model's
ability to effectively integrate both paralinguistic and linguistic information
within contextual settings.

accessibility have made it easier than ever for students to automatically
generate texts, posing new challenges for educational institutions. To enforce
norms of academic integrity and ensure students' learning, learning analytics
methods to automatically detect LLM-generated text appear increasingly
appealing. This paper benchmarks the performance of different state-of-the-art
detectors in educational contexts, introducing a novel dataset, called
Generative Essay Detection in Education (GEDE), containing over 900
student-written essays and over 12,500 LLM-generated essays from various
domains. To capture the diversity of LLM usage practices in generating text, we
propose the concept of contribution levels, representing students' contribution
to a given assignment. These levels range from purely human-written texts, to
slightly LLM-improved versions, to fully LLM-generated texts, and finally to
active attacks on the detector by "humanizing" generated texts. We show that
most detectors struggle to accurately classify texts of intermediate student
contribution levels, like LLM-improved human-written texts. Detectors are
particularly likely to produce false positives, which is problematic in
educational settings where false suspicions can severely impact students'
lives. Our dataset, code, and additional supplementary materials are publicly
available at

Motivation: 研究模型架构对自监督语音表示学习中语言信息的影响。

Method: 比较HuBERT和wav2vec 2.0的训练目标和迭代伪标签细化。

Result: 训练迭代次数显著影响隐藏表示与词、音素和说话者身份的关联。

Conclusion: 建议未来研究迭代细化在编码语言信息中的有效性原因。

Abstract: Self-supervised models for speech representation learning now see widespread
use for their versatility and performance on downstream tasks, but the effect
of model architecture on the linguistic information learned in their
representations remains under-studied. This study investigates two such models,
HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0, and minimally compares two of their architectural
differences: training objective and iterative pseudo-label refinement through
multiple training iterations. We find that differences in canonical correlation
of hidden representations to word identity, phoneme identity, and speaker
identity are explained by training iteration, not training objective. We
suggest that future work investigate the reason for the effectiveness of
iterative refinement in encoding linguistic information in self-supervised
speech representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有捷克语数据集仅支持基本ABSA任务，无法满足复杂任务需求，因此需要设计一个统一标注格式的新数据集。

Method: 基于SemEval-2016格式构建数据集，采用双标注员标注，一致性达90%，并提供24M未标注评论用于无监督学习。

Result: 数据集支持跨语言比较，并提供了基于Transformer模型的基线结果和错误分析。

Conclusion: 新数据集填补了捷克语ABSA领域的空白，为复杂任务和跨语言研究提供了支持。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel Czech dataset for aspect-based sentiment
analysis (ABSA), which consists of 3.1K manually annotated reviews from the
restaurant domain. The dataset is built upon the older Czech dataset, which
contained only separate labels for the basic ABSA tasks such as aspect term
extraction or aspect polarity detection. Unlike its predecessor, our new
dataset is specifically designed for more complex tasks, e.g.
target-aspect-category detection. These advanced tasks require a unified
annotation format, seamlessly linking sentiment elements (labels) together. Our
dataset follows the format of the well-known SemEval-2016 datasets. This design
choice allows effortless application and evaluation in cross-lingual scenarios,
ultimately fostering cross-language comparisons with equivalent counterpart
datasets in other languages. The annotation process engaged two trained
annotators, yielding an impressive inter-annotator agreement rate of
approximately 90%. Additionally, we provide 24M reviews without annotations
suitable for unsupervised learning. We present robust monolingual baseline
results achieved with various Transformer-based models and insightful error
analysis to supplement our contributions. Our code and dataset are freely
available for non-commercial research purposes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为OTReg的方法，通过最优传输正则化来缩小语音与文本表征之间的模态差距，从而提升口语语言模型（SLM）的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现，尽管口语语言模型（SLM）在语音理解任务中表现出潜力，但其泛化能力不足，尤其是在跨数据集时表现不佳。这可能是由于语音与文本表征之间的模态差距导致的。

Method: 作者提出了OTReg方法，将语音与文本对齐建模为最优传输问题，并通过正则化损失优化SLM训练，无需额外标签或可学习参数。

Result: 多语言ASR实验表明，OTReg有效提升了语音与文本的对齐效果，缩小了模态差距，并显著改善了SLM的泛化性能。

Conclusion: OTReg是一种轻量级且高效的方法，能够无缝集成到现有SLM训练流程中，为解决语音与文本模态差距问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Spoken Language Models (SLMs), which extend Large Language Models (LLMs) to
perceive speech inputs, have gained increasing attention for their potential to
advance speech understanding tasks. However, despite recent progress, studies
show that SLMs often struggle to generalize across datasets, even for trained
languages and tasks, raising concerns about whether they process speech in a
text-like manner as intended. A key challenge underlying this limitation is the
modality gap between speech and text representations. The high variability in
speech embeddings may allow SLMs to achieve strong in-domain performance by
exploiting unintended speech variations, ultimately hindering generalization.
To mitigate this modality gap, we introduce Optimal Transport Regularization
(OTReg), a method that formulates speech-text alignment as an optimal transport
problem and derives a regularization loss to improve SLM training. In each
training iteration, OTReg first establishes a structured correspondence between
speech and transcript embeddings by determining the optimal transport plan,
then incorporates the regularization loss based on this transport plan to
optimize SLMs in generating speech embeddings that align more effectively with
transcript embeddings. OTReg is lightweight, requiring no additional labels or
learnable parameters, and integrates seamlessly into existing SLM training
procedures. Extensive multilingual ASR experiments demonstrate that OTReg
enhances speech-text alignment, mitigates the modality gap, and consequently
improves SLM generalization across diverse datasets.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成内容时的可靠性问题，提出了一种基于标记级不确定性的可靠性估计方法，以改进不可靠输出的检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs容易生成流畅但不正确的内容（即虚构），在多轮或代理应用中可能带来风险。研究旨在探索上下文信息如何影响模型行为，以及LLMs是否能识别自身不可靠的响应。

Method: 通过计算输出logits的偶然性和认知不确定性，识别显著标记，并将其隐藏状态聚合为紧凑表示，用于响应级可靠性预测。

Result: 实验表明，正确的上下文信息提高了答案准确性和模型信心，而误导性上下文常导致自信的错误回答。提出的探测方法改进了对不可靠输出的检测。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了直接不确定性信号的局限性，并强调了不确定性引导探测在可靠性感知生成中的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating fluent but incorrect
content, known as confabulation, which poses increasing risks in multi-turn or
agentic applications where outputs may be reused as context. In this work, we
investigate how in-context information influences model behavior and whether
LLMs can identify their unreliable responses. We propose a reliability
estimation that leverages token-level uncertainty to guide the aggregation of
internal model representations. Specifically, we compute aleatoric and
epistemic uncertainty from output logits to identify salient tokens and
aggregate their hidden states into compact representations for response-level
reliability prediction. Through controlled experiments on open QA benchmarks,
we find that correct in-context information improves both answer accuracy and
model confidence, while misleading context often induces confidently incorrect
responses, revealing a misalignment between uncertainty and correctness. Our
probing-based method captures these shifts in model behavior and improves the
detection of unreliable outputs across multiple open-source LLMs. These results
underscore the limitations of direct uncertainty signals and highlight the
potential of uncertainty-guided probing for reliability-aware generation.

TL;DR: Dual-Div框架通过两阶段检索和排序，优化生物医学ICL任务中的示例选择，强调多样性和代表性，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生物医学NLP任务中选择示例时过于注重代表性而忽视多样性，Dual-Div旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用两阶段检索和排序：首阶段优化代表性和多样性选择候选示例，次阶段针对测试查询排序选出最相关且非冗余的示例。

Result: 在三个生物医学NLP任务中，Dual-Div显著优于基线方法，F1分数提升高达5%，且对提示变化和类别不平衡具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 初始检索阶段的多样性比排序阶段优化更重要，且3-5个示例能最大化性能效率。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has leveraged their
in-context learning (ICL) abilities to enable quick adaptation to unseen
biomedical NLP tasks. By incorporating only a few input-output examples into
prompts, LLMs can rapidly perform these new tasks. While the impact of these
demonstrations on LLM performance has been extensively studied, most existing
approaches prioritize representativeness over diversity when selecting examples
from large corpora. To address this gap, we propose Dual-Div, a
diversity-enhanced data-efficient framework for demonstration selection in
biomedical ICL. Dual-Div employs a two-stage retrieval and ranking process:
First, it identifies a limited set of candidate examples from a corpus by
optimizing both representativeness and diversity (with optional annotation for
unlabeled data). Second, it ranks these candidates against test queries to
select the most relevant and non-redundant demonstrations. Evaluated on three
biomedical NLP tasks (named entity recognition (NER), relation extraction (RE),
and text classification (TC)) using LLaMA 3.1 and Qwen 2.5 for inference, along
with three retrievers (BGE-Large, BMRetriever, MedCPT), Dual-Div consistently
outperforms baselines-achieving up to 5% higher macro-F1 scores-while
demonstrating robustness to prompt permutations and class imbalance. Our
findings establish that diversity in initial retrieval is more critical than
ranking-stage optimization, and limiting demonstrations to 3-5 examples
maximizes performance efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文提出REX-RAG框架，通过混合采样策略和政策校正机制解决LLM在强化学习中的推理路径问题，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在强化学习中常陷入无效推理路径（“死胡同”），导致决策错误，影响探索和政策优化。

Method: 提出REX-RAG框架，结合混合采样策略（探针采样与探索性提示）和政策校正机制（重要性采样）。

Result: 在七个问答基准测试中，REX-RAG在Qwen2.5-3B和Qwen2.5-7B上分别平均提升5.1%和3.6%。

Conclusion: REX-RAG通过创新方法有效解决推理路径问题，显著提升LLM在强化学习中的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a powerful paradigm for enabling
large language models (LLMs) to perform complex reasoning tasks. Recent
advances indicate that integrating RL with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
allows LLMs to dynamically incorporate external knowledge, leading to more
informed and robust decision making. However, we identify a critical challenge
during policy-driven trajectory sampling: LLMs are frequently trapped in
unproductive reasoning paths, which we refer to as "dead ends", committing to
overconfident yet incorrect conclusions. This severely hampers exploration and
undermines effective policy optimization. To address this challenge, we propose
REX-RAG (Reasoning Exploration with Policy Correction in Retrieval-Augmented
Generation), a novel framework that explores alternative reasoning paths while
maintaining rigorous policy learning through principled distributional
corrections. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) Mixed Sampling
Strategy, which combines a novel probe sampling method with exploratory prompts
to escape dead ends; and (2) Policy Correction Mechanism, which employs
importance sampling to correct distribution shifts induced by mixed sampling,
thereby mitigating gradient estimation bias. We evaluate it on seven
question-answering benchmarks, and the experimental results show that REX-RAG
achieves average performance gains of 5.1% on Qwen2.5-3B and 3.6% on Qwen2.5-7B
over strong baselines, demonstrating competitive results across multiple
datasets. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/MiliLab/REX-RAG.

improvements. In this paper, we extend the DisCo by incorporating annotator
metadata, enhancing input representations, and modifying the loss functions to
capture disagreement patterns better. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate substantial improvements in both soft and perspectivist evaluation
metrics across three datasets. We also conduct in-depth error and calibration
analyses, highlighting the conditions under which improvements occur. Our
findings underscore the value of disagreement-aware modeling and offer insights
into how system components interact with the complexity of human-annotated
data.

Result: 在8个NVIDIA H100 GPU上，Llama4 Maverick的推理延迟为每token约4毫秒（批量大小为1），比之前最佳方法快10%。

Conclusion: 优化后的EAGLE-based推测解码在批量较大时实现了1.4x至2.0x的加速。

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a standard method for accelerating the inference
speed of large language models. However, scaling it for production environments
poses several engineering challenges, including efficiently implementing
different operations (e.g., tree attention and multi-round speculative
decoding) on GPU. In this paper, we detail the training and inference
optimization techniques that we have implemented to enable EAGLE-based
speculative decoding at a production scale for Llama models. With these
changes, we achieve a new state-of-the-art inference latency for Llama models.
For example, Llama4 Maverick decodes at a speed of about 4 ms per token (with a
batch size of one) on 8 NVIDIA H100 GPUs, which is 10% faster than the
previously best known method. Furthermore, for EAGLE-based speculative
decoding, our optimizations enable us to achieve a speed-up for large batch
sizes between 1.4x and 2.0x at production scale.

Result: 发现部分度量方法与人类不确定性高度一致，且模型校准效果良好。

Conclusion: 结论表明，某些不确定性度量方法能有效反映人类不确定性，并具备良好的模型校准特性。

Abstract: There has been much recent interest in evaluating large language models for
uncertainty calibration to facilitate model control and modulate user trust.
Inference time uncertainty, which may provide a real-time signal to the model
or external control modules, is particularly important for applying these
concepts to improve LLM-user experience in practice. While many of the existing
papers consider model calibration, comparatively little work has sought to
evaluate how closely model uncertainty aligns to human uncertainty. In this
work, we evaluate a collection of inference-time uncertainty measures, using
both established metrics and novel variations, to determine how closely they
align with both human group-level uncertainty and traditional notions of model
calibration. We find that numerous measures show evidence of strong alignment
to human uncertainty, even despite the lack of alignment to human answer
preference. For those successful metrics, we find moderate to strong evidence
of model calibration in terms of both correctness correlation and
distributional analysis.

Motivation: 现有水印方法损害文本质量且依赖白盒模型，限制了API模型和多语言场景的应用。

Method: 基于生成文本的确定性特征，选择特征统计与密钥目标对齐的输出，通过采样而非修改保留质量。

Result: 实验显示SAEMark在4个数据集中表现一致，英语F1达99.7%，多比特检测准确率高。

Conclusion: SAEMark为封闭模型提供可扩展水印新范式，支持内容溯源且不影响质量。

Abstract: Watermarking LLM-generated text is critical for content attribution and
misinformation prevention. However, existing methods compromise text quality,
require white-box model access and logit manipulation. These limitations
exclude API-based models and multilingual scenarios. We propose SAEMark, a
general framework for post-hoc multi-bit watermarking that embeds personalized
messages solely via inference-time, feature-based rejection sampling without
altering model logits or requiring training. Our approach operates on
deterministic features extracted from generated text, selecting outputs whose
feature statistics align with key-derived targets. This framework naturally
generalizes across languages and domains while preserving text quality through
sampling LLM outputs instead of modifying. We provide theoretical guarantees
relating watermark success probability and compute budget that hold for any
suitable feature extractor. Empirically, we demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), achieving superior detection
accuracy and text quality. Experiments across 4 datasets show SAEMark's
consistent performance, with 99.7% F1 on English and strong multi-bit detection
accuracy. SAEMark establishes a new paradigm for scalable watermarking that
works out-of-the-box with closed-source LLMs while enabling content
attribution.

Motivation: 研究旨在评估GPT-5在医学领域的零样本推理能力，尤其是多模态任务中的表现。

Method: 通过标准化数据集（如MedQA、MedXpertQA等）评估GPT-5及其变体在文本和多模态问答任务中的性能。

Result: GPT-5在所有基准测试中表现最佳，多模态推理能力显著提升，超越人类专家。

Conclusion: GPT-5的性能提升为未来临床决策支持系统设计提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled general-purpose
systems to perform increasingly complex domain-specific reasoning without
extensive fine-tuning. In the medical domain, decision-making often requires
integrating heterogeneous information sources, including patient narratives,
structured data, and medical images. This study positions GPT-5 as a generalist
multimodal reasoner for medical decision support and systematically evaluates
its zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning performance on both text-based
question answering and visual question answering tasks under a unified
protocol. We benchmark GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano, and GPT-4o-2024-11-20
against standardized splits of MedQA, MedXpertQA (text and multimodal), MMLU
medical subsets, USMLE self-assessment exams, and VQA-RAD. Results show that
GPT-5 consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving state-of-the-art
accuracy across all QA benchmarks and delivering substantial gains in
multimodal reasoning. On MedXpertQA MM, GPT-5 improves reasoning and
understanding scores by +29.62% and +36.18% over GPT-4o, respectively, and
surpasses pre-licensed human experts by +24.23% in reasoning and +29.40% in
understanding. In contrast, GPT-4o remains below human expert performance in
most dimensions. A representative case study demonstrates GPT-5's ability to
integrate visual and textual cues into a coherent diagnostic reasoning chain,
recommending appropriate high-stakes interventions. Our results show that, on
these controlled multimodal reasoning benchmarks, GPT-5 moves from
human-comparable to above human-expert performance. This improvement may
substantially inform the design of future clinical decision-support systems.

Motivation: 由于缺乏黄金标准答案和伦理敏感性，评估LLM在心理健康对话中的安全对齐性具有挑战性。

Method: 采用基于提示的LLM-as-Judge方法，结合专家定义的推理链进行上下文评估，并使用二进制点评分增强可解释性。

Result: 实验显示，该方法与专家评估一致性最高，且评估理由更易解释。

Conclusion: PsyCrisis-Bench及其评估工具公开可用，以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Evaluating the safety alignment of LLM responses in high-risk mental health
dialogues is particularly difficult due to missing gold-standard answers and
the ethically sensitive nature of these interactions. To address this
challenge, we propose PsyCrisis-Bench, a reference-free evaluation benchmark
based on real-world Chinese mental health dialogues. It evaluates whether the
model responses align with the safety principles defined by experts.
Specifically designed for settings without standard references, our method
adopts a prompt-based LLM-as-Judge approach that conducts in-context evaluation
using expert-defined reasoning chains grounded in psychological intervention
principles. We employ binary point-wise scoring across multiple safety
dimensions to enhance the explainability and traceability of the evaluation.
Additionally, we present a manually curated, high-quality Chinese-language
dataset covering self-harm, suicidal ideation, and existential distress,
derived from real-world online discourse. Experiments on 3600 judgments show
that our method achieves the highest agreement with expert assessments and
produces more interpretable evaluation rationales compared to existing
approaches. Our dataset and evaluation tool are publicly available to
facilitate further research.

Abstract: Unlimited, or so-called helpful-only language models are trained without
safety alignment constraints and never refuse user queries. They are widely
used by leading AI companies as internal tools for red teaming and alignment
evaluation. For example, if a safety-aligned model produces harmful outputs
similar to an unlimited model, this indicates alignment failures that require
further attention. Despite their essential role in assessing alignment, such
models are not available to the research community.
  We introduce Jinx, a helpful-only variant of popular open-weight LLMs. Jinx
responds to all queries without refusals or safety filtering, while preserving
the base model's capabilities in reasoning and instruction following. It
provides researchers with an accessible tool for probing alignment failures,
evaluating safety boundaries, and systematically studying failure modes in
language model safety.

Abstract: Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the leading cause of death globally,
with computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) serving as a key
diagnostic tool. However, coronary arterial analysis using CTCA, such as
identifying artery-specific features from computational modelling, is
labour-intensive and time-consuming. Automated anatomical labelling of coronary
arteries offers a potential solution, yet the inherent anatomical variability
of coronary trees presents a significant challenge. Traditional knowledge-based
labelling methods fall short in leveraging data-driven insights, while recent
deep-learning approaches often demand substantial computational resources and
overlook critical clinical knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose
a lightweight method that integrates anatomical knowledge with rule-based
topology constraints for effective coronary artery labelling. Our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, providing a
promising alternative for automated coronary artery labelling.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable classification of brain tumors from magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is critical for effective diagnosis and treatment
planning. This study presents an ensemble-based deep learning framework that
combines MobileNetV2 and DenseNet121 convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using
a soft voting strategy to classify three common brain tumor types: glioma,
meningioma, and pituitary adenoma. The models were trained and evaluated on the
Figshare dataset using a stratified 5-fold cross-validation protocol. To
enhance transparency and clinical trust, the framework integrates an
Explainable AI (XAI) module employing Grad-CAM++ for class-specific saliency
visualization, alongside a symbolic Clinical Decision Rule Overlay (CDRO) that
maps predictions to established radiological heuristics. The ensemble
classifier achieved superior performance compared to individual CNNs, with an
accuracy of 91.7%, precision of 91.9%, recall of 91.7%, and F1-score of 91.6%.
Grad-CAM++ visualizations revealed strong spatial alignment between model
attention and expert-annotated tumor regions, supported by Dice coefficients up
to 0.88 and IoU scores up to 0.78. Clinical rule activation further validated
model predictions in cases with distinct morphological features. A
human-centered interpretability assessment involving five board-certified
radiologists yielded high Likert-scale scores for both explanation usefulness
(mean = 4.4) and heatmap-region correspondence (mean = 4.0), reinforcing the
framework's clinical relevance. Overall, the proposed approach offers a robust,
interpretable, and generalizable solution for automated brain tumor
classification, advancing the integration of deep learning into clinical
neurodiagnostics.

Abstract: Image-based personalized medicine has the potential to transform healthcare,
particularly for diseases that exhibit heterogeneous progression such as
Multiple Sclerosis (MS). In this work, we introduce the first treatment-aware
spatio-temporal diffusion model that is able to generate future masks
demonstrating lesion evolution in MS. Our voxel-space approach incorporates
multi-modal patient data, including MRI and treatment information, to forecast
new and enlarging T2 (NET2) lesion masks at a future time point. Extensive
experiments on a multi-centre dataset of 2131 patient 3D MRIs from randomized
clinical trials for relapsing-remitting MS demonstrate that our generative
model is able to accurately predict NET2 lesion masks for patients across six
different treatments. Moreover, we demonstrate our model has the potential for
real-world clinical applications through downstream tasks such as future lesion
count and location estimation, binary lesion activity classification, and
generating counterfactual future NET2 masks for several treatments with
different efficacies. This work highlights the potential of causal, image-based
generative models as powerful tools for advancing data-driven prognostics in
MS.

Motivation: LLMs在医学影像任务中常产生幻觉（自信但错误的输出），可能误导临床决策，因此需要研究其成因及改进方法。

Method: 研究分析了图像到文本（生成报告）和文本到图像（生成影像）任务中的错误，使用专家标准评估输出的一致性及准确性。

Result: 发现幻觉在解释性和生成性任务中均存在常见模式，并揭示了模型架构和训练数据等因素的影响。

Conclusion: 通过系统研究，为提升LLM驱动的医学影像系统的安全性和可信度提供了见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to medical imaging
tasks, including image interpretation and synthetic image generation. However,
these models often produce hallucinations, which are confident but incorrect
outputs that can mislead clinical decisions. This study examines hallucinations
in two directions: image to text, where LLMs generate reports from X-ray, CT,
or MRI scans, and text to image, where models create medical images from
clinical prompts. We analyze errors such as factual inconsistencies and
anatomical inaccuracies, evaluating outputs using expert informed criteria
across imaging modalities. Our findings reveal common patterns of hallucination
in both interpretive and generative tasks, with implications for clinical
reliability. We also discuss factors contributing to these failures, including
model architecture and training data. By systematically studying both image
understanding and generation, this work provides insights into improving the
safety and trustworthiness of LLM driven medical imaging systems.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time novel view synthesis with high
visual fidelity, but its substantial storage requirements hinder practical
deployment, prompting state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3DGS methods to incorporate
compression modules. However, these 3DGS generative compression techniques
introduce unique distortions lacking systematic quality assessment research. To

generated from 11 scenes across 6 SOTA 3DGS compression algorithms with
systematically designed parameter levels. With annotations from 50

reliability. We benchmark 6 3DGS compression algorithms on storage efficiency
and visual quality, and evaluate 15 quality assessment metrics across multiple

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI在临床实践中常因缺失或不可用切片而影响准确性，现有方法难以建模3D数据的局部和全局关系。

Method: SAGCNet结合了切片图完成模块和空间适配器，以捕捉3D空间上下文和切片间关系。

Result: 在心脏MRI数据集上，SAGCNet表现优于现有方法，且在数据有限时仍保持高性能。

Conclusion: SAGCNet有效解决了MRI缺失切片的合成问题，为临床实践提供了更可靠的辅助工具。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides detailed soft-tissue
characteristics that assist in disease diagnosis and screening. However, the
accuracy of clinical practice is often hindered by missing or unusable slices
due to various factors. Volumetric MRI synthesis methods have been developed to
address this issue by imputing missing slices from available ones. The inherent
3D nature of volumetric MRI data, such as cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR),
poses significant challenges for missing slice imputation approaches, including
(1) the difficulty of modeling local inter-slice correlations and dependencies
of volumetric slices, and (2) the limited exploration of crucial 3D spatial
information and global context. In this study, to mitigate these issues, we
present Spatial-Aware Graph Completion Network (SAGCNet) to overcome the
dependency on complete volumetric data, featuring two main innovations: (1) a
volumetric slice graph completion module that incorporates the inter-slice
relationships into a graph structure, and (2) a volumetric spatial adapter
component that enables our model to effectively capture and utilize various
forms of 3D spatial context. Extensive experiments on cardiac MRI datasets
demonstrate that SAGCNet is capable of synthesizing absent CMR slices,
outperforming competitive state-of-the-art MRI synthesis methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, our model maintains superior
performance even with limited slice data.

Method: 收集了64个数据集（34个用于预训练），提出了一种新的预训练范式，分离解剖不变特征和序列特异性变化。

Result: PRISM在44个下游任务中表现优异，39项排名第一，显著优于非预训练模型和其他基础模型。

Conclusion: PRISM为多序列MRI分析提供了可扩展框架，增强了AI在放射学中的临床适用性。

Abstract: Multi-sequence Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers remarkable
versatility, enabling the distinct visualization of different tissue types.
Nevertheless, the inherent heterogeneity among MRI sequences poses significant
challenges to the generalization capability of deep learning models. These
challenges undermine model performance when faced with varying acquisition
parameters, thereby severely restricting their clinical utility. In this study,
we present PRISM, a foundation model PRe-trained with large-scale
multI-Sequence MRI. We collected a total of 64 datasets from both public and
private sources, encompassing a wide range of whole-body anatomical structures,
with scans spanning diverse MRI sequences. Among them, 336,476 volumetric MRI
scans from 34 datasets (8 public and 26 private) were curated to construct the
largest multi-organ multi-sequence MRI pretraining corpus to date. We propose a
novel pretraining paradigm that disentangles anatomically invariant features
from sequence-specific variations in MRI, while preserving high-level semantic
representations. We established a benchmark comprising 44 downstream tasks,
including disease diagnosis, image segmentation, registration, progression
prediction, and report generation. These tasks were evaluated on 32 public
datasets and 5 private cohorts. PRISM consistently outperformed both
non-pretrained models and existing foundation models, achieving first-rank
results in 39 out of 44 downstream benchmarks with statistical significance
improvements. These results underscore its ability to learn robust and
generalizable representations across unseen data acquired under diverse MRI
protocols. PRISM provides a scalable framework for multi-sequence MRI analysis,
thereby enhancing the translational potential of AI in radiology. It delivers
consistent performance across diverse imaging protocols, reinforcing its
clinical applicability.

Motivation: 当前空间转录组学（ST）的分辨率受限于平台技术，而现有方法在利用H&E染色组织学图像时面临特征提取、对齐和基因特异性建模的三大挑战。

Method: HaDM-ST框架包括：（i）语义蒸馏网络提取H&E图像的预测线索；（ii）空间对齐模块确保与低分辨率ST的像素级对应；（iii）通道感知对抗学习器进行细粒度基因级建模。

Result: 在200个基因的实验中，HaDM-ST在空间保真度和基因级一致性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HaDM-ST通过结合H&E图像和低分辨率ST，显著提升了高分辨率ST预测的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) reveals spatial heterogeneity of gene
expression, yet its resolution is limited by current platforms. Recent methods
enhance resolution via H&E-stained histology, but three major challenges
persist: (1) isolating expression-relevant features from visually complex H&E
images; (2) achieving spatially precise multimodal alignment in diffusion-based
frameworks; and (3) modeling gene-specific variation across expression
channels. We propose HaDM-ST (Histology-assisted Differential Modeling for ST
Generation), a high-resolution ST generation framework conditioned on H&E
images and low-resolution ST. HaDM-ST includes: (i) a semantic distillation
network to extract predictive cues from H&E; (ii) a spatial alignment module
enforcing pixel-wise correspondence with low-resolution ST; and (iii) a
channel-aware adversarial learner for fine-grained gene-level modeling.
Experiments on 200 genes across diverse tissues and species show HaDM-ST
consistently outperforms prior methods, enhancing spatial fidelity and
gene-level coherence in high-resolution ST predictions.

Motivation: 传统多步扩散方法效率低，DiffVC-OSD旨在通过一步扩散提升压缩效率和感知质量。

Method: 使用一步扩散模型，结合时间上下文适配器和端到端微调策略，优化压缩性能。

Result: DiffVC-OSD在感知压缩性能上达到最优，解码速度快20倍，比特率降低86.92%。

Conclusion: DiffVC-OSD为高效视频压缩提供了新思路，显著提升性能与效率。

Abstract: In this work, we first propose DiffVC-OSD, a One-Step Diffusion-based
Perceptual Neural Video Compression framework. Unlike conventional multi-step
diffusion-based methods, DiffVC-OSD feeds the reconstructed latent
representation directly into a One-Step Diffusion Model, enhancing perceptual
quality through a single diffusion step guided by both temporal context and the
latent itself. To better leverage temporal dependencies, we design a Temporal
Context Adapter that encodes conditional inputs into multi-level features,
offering more fine-grained guidance for the Denoising Unet. Additionally, we
employ an End-to-End Finetuning strategy to improve overall compression
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffVC-OSD achieves
state-of-the-art perceptual compression performance, offers about 20$\times$
faster decoding and a 86.92\% bitrate reduction compared to the corresponding
multi-step diffusion-based variant.

Conclusion: ALDEN通过解剖感知机制和对比学习，显著提升了低剂量CT去噪的效果，同时保留了重要的解剖结构信息。

Abstract: To reduce radiation exposure and improve the diagnostic efficacy of low-dose
computed tomography (LDCT), numerous deep learning-based denoising methods have
been developed to mitigate noise and artifacts. However, most of these
approaches ignore the anatomical semantics of human tissues, which may
potentially result in suboptimal denoising outcomes. To address this problem,
we propose ALDEN, an anatomy-aware LDCT denoising method that integrates
semantic features of pretrained vision models (PVMs) with adversarial and
contrastive learning. Specifically, we introduce an anatomy-aware discriminator
that dynamically fuses hierarchical semantic features from reference
normal-dose CT (NDCT) via cross-attention mechanisms, enabling tissue-specific
realism evaluation in the discriminator. In addition, we propose a
semantic-guided contrastive learning module that enforces anatomical
consistency by contrasting PVM-derived features from LDCT, denoised CT and
NDCT, preserving tissue-specific patterns through positive pairs and
suppressing artifacts via dual negative pairs. Extensive experiments conducted
on two LDCT denoising datasets reveal that ALDEN achieves the state-of-the-art
performance, offering superior anatomy preservation and substantially reducing
over-smoothing issue of previous work. Further validation on a downstream
multi-organ segmentation task (encompassing 117 anatomical structures) affirms
the model's ability to maintain anatomical awareness.

Abstract: Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most prevalent form of breast cancer,
and early, accurate diagnosis is critical to improving patient survival rates
by guiding treatment decisions. Combining medical expertise with artificial
intelligence (AI) holds significant promise for enhancing the precision and
efficiency of IDC detection. In this work, we propose a human-in-the-loop
(HITL) deep learning system designed to detect IDC in histopathology images.
The system begins with an initial diagnosis provided by a high-performance
EfficientNetV2S model, offering feedback from AI to the human expert. Medical
professionals then review the AI-generated results, correct any misclassified
images, and integrate the revised labels into the training dataset, forming a
feedback loop from the human back to the AI. This iterative process refines the
model's performance over time. The EfficientNetV2S model itself achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods in the literature,
with an overall accuracy of 93.65\%. Incorporating the human-in-the-loop system
further improves the model's accuracy using four experimental groups with
misclassified images. These results demonstrate the potential of this
collaborative approach to enhance AI performance in diagnostic systems. This
work contributes to advancing automated, efficient, and highly accurate methods
for IDC detection through human-AI collaboration, offering a promising
direction for future AI-assisted medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in generative modelling, existing diffusion
models often struggle to produce anatomically precise female pelvic images,
limiting their application in gynaecological imaging, where data scarcity and

a novel diffusion-based framework for uterine MRI synthesis, integrating both
unconditional and conditioned Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs)
and Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in 2D and 3D. Our approach generates
anatomically coherent, high fidelity synthetic images that closely mimic real
scans and provide valuable resources for training robust diagnostic models. We
evaluate generative quality using advanced perceptual and distributional
metrics, benchmarking against standard reconstruction methods, and demonstrate
substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy on a key classification task. A
blinded expert evaluation further validates the clinical realism of our
synthetic images. We release our models with privacy safeguards and a
comprehensive synthetic uterine MRI dataset to support reproducible research
and advance equitable AI in gynaecology.

Abstract: We propose a deep learning-based approach that integrates MRI sequence

synthesis from clinical weighted MRI. Our physics-driven neural network embeds
MRI sequence parameters -- repetition time (TR), echo time (TE), and inversion
time (TI) -- directly into the model via parameter embedding, enabling the
network to learn the underlying physical principles of MRI signal formation.
The model takes conventional T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and T2-FLAIR images as
input and synthesizes T1, T2, and proton density (PD) quantitative maps.
Trained on healthy brain MR images, it was evaluated on both internal and
external test datasets. The proposed method achieved high performance with PSNR
values exceeding 34 dB and SSIM values above 0.92 for all synthesized parameter
maps. It outperformed conventional deep learning models in accuracy and
robustness, including data with previously unseen brain structures and lesions.
Notably, our model accurately synthesized quantitative maps for these unseen
pathological regions, highlighting its superior generalization capability.
Incorporating MRI sequence parameters via parameter embedding allows the neural
network to better learn the physical characteristics of MR signals,
significantly enhancing the performance and reliability of quantitative MRI
synthesis. This method shows great potential for accelerating qMRI and
improving its clinical utility.

consequence: an emergent property of the curvature and flow inherent in
biological state space. We develop a theory of Self-Organizing Survival
Manifolds (SOSM), in which survival-relevant dynamics arise from low-curvature
geodesic flows on latent manifolds shaped by internal biological constraints. A
survival energy functional based on geodesic curvature minimization is
introduced and shown to induce structures where prognosis aligns with geometric
flow stability. We derive discrete and continuous formulations of the objective
and prove theoretical results demonstrating the emergence and convergence of
survival-aligned trajectories under biologically plausible conditions. The
framework draws connections to thermodynamic efficiency, entropy flow, Ricci
curvature, and optimal transport, grounding survival modeling in physical law.
Health, disease, aging, and death are reframed as geometric phase transitions
in the manifold's structure. This theory offers a universal, label-free
foundation for modeling survival as a property of form, not annotation-bridging
machine learning, biophysics, and the geometry of life itself.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代供应链欺诈检测面临数据复杂性和标记数据稀缺的挑战，传统方法效果有限。

Method: 第一阶段使用Isolation Forest进行无监督异常检测，第二阶段用自训练SVM结合标记和高置信度伪标记数据进行半监督学习。

Result: 在DataCo数据集上取得F1-score 0.817，假阳性率低于3.0%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合无监督和半监督学习，但需进一步解决概念漂移问题并与深度学习方法比较。

Abstract: Detecting fraud in modern supply chains is a growing challenge, driven by the
complexity of global networks and the scarcity of labeled data. Traditional
detection methods often struggle with class imbalance and limited supervision,
reducing their effectiveness in real-world applications. This paper proposes a
novel two-phase learning framework to address these challenges. In the first
phase, the Isolation Forest algorithm performs unsupervised anomaly detection
to identify potential fraud cases and reduce the volume of data requiring
further analysis. In the second phase, a self-training Support Vector Machine
(SVM) refines the predictions using both labeled and high-confidence
pseudo-labeled samples, enabling robust semi-supervised learning. The proposed
method is evaluated on the DataCo Smart Supply Chain Dataset, a comprehensive
real-world supply chain dataset with fraud indicators. It achieves an F1-score
of 0.817 while maintaining a false positive rate below 3.0%. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of combining unsupervised
pre-filtering with semi-supervised refinement for supply chain fraud detection
under real-world constraints, though we acknowledge limitations regarding
concept drift and the need for comparison with deep learning approaches.

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions pose a significant challenge in clinical pharmacology,
with severe class imbalance among interaction types limiting the effectiveness
of predictive models. Common interactions dominate datasets, while rare but
critical interactions remain underrepresented, leading to poor model
performance on infrequent cases. Existing methods often treat DDI prediction as
a binary problem, ignoring class-specific nuances and exacerbating bias toward
frequent interactions. To address this, we propose a framework combining
Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNet) with Variational Graph Autoencoders (VGAE)
to generate synthetic samples for rare classes, improving model balance and
generate effective and novel DDI pairs. Our approach enhances predictive
performance across interaction types, ensuring better clinical reliability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型超图神经网络HGMN，结合状态空间模型和角色感知表示，显著提升了节点分类任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN主要关注节点间的邻接关系，忽略了角色特征的重要性，现有方法多为无监督且性能不佳。

Method: HGMN通过超图构建技术建模高阶关系，结合角色和邻接表示，使用可学习的mamba transformer机制，并引入残差网络防止过平滑。

Result: 在多个数据集上，HGMN显著优于现有GNN方法，节点分类任务表现突出。

Conclusion: HGMN通过融合角色特征和邻接信息，提供了更丰富的节点表示，适用于多种图学习任务。

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained significant
attention for node classification tasks on graph-structured data. However,
traditional GNNs primarily focus on adjacency relationships between nodes,
often overlooking the rich role-based characteristics that are crucial for
learning more expressive node representations. Existing methods for capturing
role-based features are largely unsupervised and fail to achieve optimal
performance in downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel hypergraph neural network with state space model (HGMN) that effectively
integrates role-aware representations into GNNs and the state space model. HGMN
utilizes hypergraph construction techniques to model higher-order relationships
and combines role-based and adjacency-based representations through a learnable
mamba transformer mechanism. By leveraging two distinct hypergraph construction
methods-based on node degree and neighborhood levels, it strengthens the
connections among nodes with similar roles, enhancing the model's
representational power. Additionally, the inclusion of hypergraph convolution
layers enables the model to capture complex dependencies within hypergraph
structures. To mitigate the over-smoothing problem inherent in deep GNNs, we
incorporate a residual network, ensuring improved stability and better feature
propagation across layers. Extensive experiments conducted on one newly
introduced dataset and four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of
HGMN. The model achieves significant performance improvements on node
classification tasks compared to state-of-the-art GNN methods. These results
highlight HGMN's ability to provide enriched node representations by
effectively embedding role-based features alongside adjacency information,
making it a versatile and powerful tool for a variety of graph-based learning
applications.

Method: 提出RGVQ框架，结合图拓扑和特征相似性作为正则化信号，引入Gumbel-Softmax软分配和结构感知对比正则化。

Result: RGVQ显著提高了代码本利用率，并在多个下游任务中提升了性能。

Conclusion: RGVQ为图数据提供了更具表达力和可迁移性的令牌表示。

Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) has recently emerged as a promising approach for
learning discrete representations of graph-structured data. However, a
fundamental challenge, i.e., codebook collapse, remains underexplored in the
graph domain, significantly limiting the expressiveness and generalization of
graph tokens.In this paper, we present the first empirical study showing that
codebook collapse consistently occurs when applying VQ to graph data, even with
mitigation strategies proposed in vision or language domains. To understand why
graph VQ is particularly vulnerable to collapse, we provide a theoretical
analysis and identify two key factors: early assignment imbalances caused by
redundancy in graph features and structural patterns, and self-reinforcing
optimization loops in deterministic VQ. To address these issues, we propose
RGVQ, a novel framework that integrates graph topology and feature similarity
as explicit regularization signals to enhance codebook utilization and promote
token diversity. RGVQ introduces soft assignments via Gumbel-Softmax
reparameterization, ensuring that all codewords receive gradient updates. In
addition, RGVQ incorporates a structure-aware contrastive regularization to
penalize the token co-assignments among similar node pairs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that RGVQ substantially improves codebook utilization
and consistently boosts the performance of state-of-the-art graph VQ backbones
across multiple downstream tasks, enabling more expressive and transferable
graph token representations.

Conclusion: 该框架通过处理异质性和亚型混淆，提升了神经影像CAD系统的可靠性和可重复性，对个性化医疗和临床决策有重要意义。

Abstract: Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems play a crucial role in analyzing
neuroimaging data for neurological and psychiatric disorders. However,
small-sample studies suffer from low reproducibility, while large-scale
datasets introduce confounding heterogeneity due to multiple disease subtypes
being labeled under a single category. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel federated learning framework tailored for neuroimaging CAD systems. Our
approach includes a dynamic navigation module that routes samples to the most
suitable local models based on latent subtype representations, and a
meta-integration module that combines predictions from heterogeneous local
models into a unified diagnostic output. We evaluated our framework using a
comprehensive dataset comprising fMRI data from over 1300 MDD patients and 1100
healthy controls across multiple study cohorts. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy and robustness
compared to traditional methods. Specifically, our framework achieved an
average accuracy of 74.06\% across all tested sites, showcasing its
effectiveness in handling subtype heterogeneity and enhancing model
generalizability. Ablation studies further confirmed the importance of both the
dynamic navigation and meta-integration modules in improving performance. By
addressing data heterogeneity and subtype confounding, our framework advances
reliable and reproducible neuroimaging CAD systems, offering significant
potential for personalized medicine and clinical decision-making in neurology
and psychiatry.

Conclusion: AI辅助设计能够推动现实世界的材料创新，并促进人机协作。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have reshaped the research landscape by enabling
new approaches to knowledge retrieval and creative ideation. Yet their
application in discipline-specific experimental science, particularly in highly
multi-disciplinary domains like materials science, remains limited. We present
a first-of-its-kind framework that integrates generative AI with literature
from hitherto-unconnected fields such as plant science, biomimetics, and
materials engineering to extract insights and design experiments for materials.
We focus on humidity-responsive systems such as pollen-based materials and
Rhapis excelsa (broadleaf lady palm) leaves, which exhibit self-actuation and
adaptive performance. Using a suite of AI tools, including a fine-tuned model
(BioinspiredLLM), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), agentic systems, and a
Hierarchical Sampling strategy, we extract structure-property relationships and
translate them into new classes of bioinspired materials. Structured inference
protocols generate and evaluate hundreds of hypotheses from a single query,
surfacing novel and experimentally tractable ideas. We validate our approach
through real-world implementation: LLM-generated procedures, materials designs,
and mechanical predictions were tested in the laboratory, culminating in the
fabrication of a novel pollen-based adhesive with tunable morphology and
measured shear strength, establishing a foundation for future plant-derived
adhesive design. This work demonstrates how AI-assisted ideation can drive
real-world materials design and enable effective human-AI collaboration.

Motivation: 开放权重AI系统虽具透明性和开放性，但易受篡改攻击，现有安全微调方法效果有限，需探索更有效的防护措施。

Method: 提出多阶段数据过滤管道，从训练数据中移除双用途主题内容，并预训练6.9B参数模型以验证其抗攻击能力。

Conclusion: 数据过滤是开放权重AI系统的一种有效防护层，但仍需结合其他防御措施以全面应对风险。

Abstract: Open-weight AI systems offer unique benefits, including enhanced
transparency, open research, and decentralized access. However, they are
vulnerable to tampering attacks which can efficiently elicit harmful behaviors
by modifying weights or activations. Currently, there is not yet a robust
science of open-weight model risk management. Existing safety fine-tuning
methods and other post-training techniques have struggled to make LLMs
resistant to more than a few dozen steps of adversarial fine-tuning. In this
paper, we investigate whether filtering text about dual-use topics from
training data can prevent unwanted capabilities and serve as a more
tamper-resistant safeguard. We introduce a multi-stage pipeline for scalable
data filtering and show that it offers a tractable and effective method for
minimizing biothreat proxy knowledge in LLMs. We pretrain multiple
6.9B-parameter models from scratch and find that they exhibit substantial
resistance to adversarial fine-tuning attacks on up to 10,000 steps and 300M
tokens of biothreat-related text -- outperforming existing post-training
baselines by over an order of magnitude -- with no observed degradation to
unrelated capabilities. However, while filtered models lack internalized
dangerous knowledge, we find that they can still leverage such information when
it is provided in context (e.g., via search tool augmentation), demonstrating a
need for a defense-in-depth approach. Overall, these findings help to establish
pretraining data curation as a promising layer of defense for open-weight AI
systems.

Conclusion: 本文为扩散模型提供了更高效的架构设计思路，并开辟了研究数据分布相位的新方向。

Abstract: As a class of generative artificial intelligence frameworks inspired by
statistical physics, diffusion models have shown extraordinary performance in
synthesizing complicated data distributions through a denoising process
gradually guided by score functions. Real-life data, like images, is often
spatially structured in low-dimensional spaces. However, ordinary diffusion
models ignore this local structure and learn spatially global score functions,
which are often computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce a new
perspective on the phases of data distributions, which provides insight into
constructing local denoisers with reduced computational costs. We define two
distributions as belonging to the same data distribution phase if they can be
mutually connected via spatially local operations such as local denoisers.
Then, we show that the reverse denoising process consists of an early trivial
phase and a late data phase, sandwiching a rapid phase transition where local
denoisers must fail. To diagnose such phase transitions, we prove an
information-theoretic bound on the fidelity of local denoisers based on
conditional mutual information, and conduct numerical experiments in a
real-world dataset. This work suggests simpler and more efficient architectures
of diffusion models: far from the phase transition point, we can use small
local neural networks to compute the score function; global neural networks are
only necessary around the narrow time interval of phase transitions. This
result also opens up new directions for studying phases of data distributions,
the broader science of generative artificial intelligence, and guiding the
design of neural networks inspired by physics concepts.

Result: 通过评估和比较，证明了所提扩展定律的有效性。

Conclusion: 通用扩展定律为密集和稀疏模型提供了统一的框架，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Over the past few years, the size of language models has grown exponentially,
as has the computational cost to train these large models. This rapid growth
has motivated researchers to develop new techniques aimed at enhancing the
efficiency of the training process. Despite these advancements, optimally
predicting the model size or allocating optimal resources remains a challenge.
Several efforts have addressed the challenge by proposing different scaling
laws, but almost all of them are architecture-specific (dense or sparse). In
this work we revisit existing scaling laws and propose a generalized scaling
law to provide a unified framework that is applicable to both dense and sparse
large language models. We evaluate and compare our proposed scaling law with
existing scaling laws to demonstrate its effectiveness.

Result: 有效减少噪声标签样本的影响，性能优于同类方法，计算复杂度接近标准交叉熵损失。

Conclusion: ANTIDOTE在多种噪声环境下表现优异，计算效率高。

Abstract: We introduce ANTIDOTE, a new class of objectives for learning under noisy
labels which are defined in terms of a relaxation over an
information-divergence neighborhood. Using convex duality, we provide a
reformulation as an adversarial training method that has similar computational
cost to training with standard cross-entropy loss. We show that our approach
adaptively reduces the influence of the samples with noisy labels during
learning, exhibiting a behavior that is analogous to forgetting those samples.
ANTIDOTE is effective in practical environments where label noise is inherent
in the training data or where an adversary can alter the training labels.
Extensive empirical evaluations on different levels of symmetric, asymmetric,
human annotation, and real-world label noise show that ANTIDOTE outperforms
leading comparable losses in the field and enjoys a time complexity that is
very close to that of the standard cross entropy loss.

Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest cancers, and
early detection remains a major clinical challenge due to the absence of
specific symptoms and reliable biomarkers. In this work, we propose a new
multimodal approach that integrates longitudinal diagnosis code histories and
routinely collected laboratory measurements from electronic health records to
detect PDAC up to one year prior to clinical diagnosis. Our method combines
neural controlled differential equations to model irregular lab time series,
pretrained language models and recurrent networks to learn diagnosis code
trajectory representations, and cross-attention mechanisms to capture
interactions between the two modalities. We develop and evaluate our approach
on a real-world dataset of nearly 4,700 patients and achieve significant
improvements in AUC ranging from 6.5% to 15.5% over state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, our model identifies diagnosis codes and laboratory panels
associated with elevated PDAC risk, including both established and new
biomarkers. Our code is available at

Abstract: Predictions and generations from large language models are increasingly being
explored as an aid to computational social science and human subject research
in limited data regimes. While previous technical work has explored the
potential to use model-predicted labels for unlabeled data in a principled
manner, there is increasing interest in using large language models to generate
entirely new synthetic samples (also termed as synthetic simulations), such as
in responses to surveys. However, it is not immediately clear by what means
practitioners can combine such data with real data and yet produce
statistically valid conclusions upon them. In this work, we introduce a new
estimator based on generalized method of moments, providing a
hyperparameter-free solution with strong theoretical guarantees to address the
challenge at hand. Surprisingly, we find that interactions between the moment
residuals of synthetic data and those of real data can improve estimates of the
target parameter. We empirically validate the finite-sample performance of our
estimator across different regression tasks in computational social science
applications, demonstrating large empirical gains.

Motivation: 传统静态阈值在非平稳环境中容易失效，需要适应统计特性随时间变化的情况。

Result: 在Wafer Manufacturing数据集上，F1分数显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 自适应阈值框架能实现可靠、可解释且及时的异常检测。

Abstract: As time series data become increasingly prevalent in domains such as
manufacturing, IT, and infrastructure monitoring, anomaly detection must adapt
to nonstationary environments where statistical properties shift over time.
Traditional static thresholds are easily rendered obsolete by regime shifts,
concept drift, or multi-scale changes. To address these challenges, we
introduce and empirically evaluate two novel adaptive thresholding frameworks:
Segmented Confidence Sequences (SCS) and Multi-Scale Adaptive Confidence
Segments (MACS). Both leverage statistical online learning and segmentation
principles for local, contextually sensitive adaptation, maintaining guarantees
on false alarm rates even under evolving distributions. Our experiments across
Wafer Manufacturing benchmark datasets show significant F1-score improvement
compared to traditional percentile and rolling quantile approaches. This work
demonstrates that robust, statistically principled adaptive thresholds enable
reliable, interpretable, and timely detection of diverse real-world anomalies.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于通用序列映射（USM）的双射分形编码方法，解决了迭代过程中的种子偏差问题，并揭示了USM作为高效数值过程的特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于Transformer的语言模型（如ChatGPT）的兴起，研究者对多尺度和多维度的符号序列数值表示方法重新产生兴趣。编码的挑战在于需要保留符号序列的上下文信息，以便通过非线性模型（如神经网络）进行建模。

Method: 通用序列映射（USM）由两个混沌游戏表示（CGR）组成，分别向前和向后迭代，可投影到频域（FCGR）。USM坐标可用于计算切比雪夫距离和k-mer频率，无需重新计算数值坐标，并支持非整数k值。

Result: 研究解决了USM迭代过程中的种子偏差问题，实现了数值定位与序列身份的全匹配，并揭示了USM作为高效数值过程的特性，收敛于稳态序列嵌入解。实验以基因组序列为例，但方法适用于任意基数字母表。

Conclusion: USM提供了一种高效且通用的序列编码方法，解决了种子偏差问题，并展示了其在多尺度序列分析中的潜力。

Abstract: Motivation: With the advent of Language Models using Transformers,
popularized by ChatGPT, there is a renewed interest in exploring encoding
procedures that numerically represent symbolic sequences at multiple scales and
embedding dimensions. The challenge that encoding addresses is the need for
mechanisms that uniquely retain contextual information about the succession of
individual symbols, which can then be modeled by nonlinear formulations such as
neural networks.
  Context: Universal Sequence Maps(USM) are iterated functions that bijectively
encode symbolic sequences onto embedded numerical spaces. USM is composed of
two Chaos Game Representations (CGR), iterated forwardly and backwardly, that
can be projected into the frequency domain (FCGR). The corresponding USM
coordinates can be used to compute a Chebyshev distance metric as well as k-mer
frequencies, without having to recompute the embedded numeric coordinates, and,
paradoxically, allowing for non-integers values of k.
  Results: This report advances the bijective fractal encoding by Universal
Sequence Maps (USM) by resolving seeding biases affecting the iterated process.
The resolution had two results, the first expected, the second an intriguing
outcome: 1) full reconciliation of numeric positioning with sequence identity;
and 2) uncovering the nature of USM as an efficient numeric process converging
towards a steady state sequence embedding solution. We illustrate these results
for genomic sequences because of the convenience of a planar representation
defined by an alphabet with only 4 tokens (the 4 nucleotides). Nevertheless,
the application to alphabet of arbitrary cardinality was found to be
straightforward.

TL;DR: CORAL框架通过分离表示学习与控制，提升强化学习代理的上下文适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习代理在新任务和环境中泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 提出CORAL框架，通过信息代理（IA）和控制代理（CA）的通信协议学习可迁移的上下文表示。

Result: 实验表明，CORAL显著提升了样本效率和零样本适应能力。

Conclusion: 学习可迁移的通信表示是提升强化学习代理适应性的有效方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents often struggle to generalize to new tasks
and contexts without updating their parameters, mainly because their learned
representations and policies are overfit to the specifics of their training
environments. To boost agents' in-context RL (ICRL) ability, this work
formulates ICRL as a two-agent emergent communication problem and introduces
CORAL (Communicative Representation for Adaptive RL), a framework that learns a
transferable communicative context by decoupling latent representation learning
from control. In CORAL, an Information Agent (IA) is pre-trained as a world
model on a diverse distribution of tasks. Its objective is not to maximize task
reward, but to build a world model and distill its understanding into concise
messages. The emergent communication protocol is shaped by a novel Causal
Influence Loss, which measures the effect that the message has on the next
action. During deployment, the previously trained IA serves as a fixed
contextualizer for a new Control Agent (CA), which learns to solve tasks by
interpreting the provided communicative context. Our experiments demonstrate
that this approach enables the CA to achieve significant gains in sample
efficiency and successfully perform zero-shot adaptation with the help of
pre-trained IA in entirely unseen sparse-reward environments, validating the
efficacy of learning a transferable communicative representation.

Conclusion: KANs能增强GNN表达能力并实现高效、无图推理。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown strong performance on
graph-structured data, but their reliance on graph connectivity often limits
scalability and efficiency. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), a recent
architecture with learnable univariate functions, offer strong nonlinear
expressiveness and efficient inference. In this work, we integrate KANs into
three popular GNN architectures-GAT, SGC, and APPNP-resulting in three new
models: KGAT, KSGC, and KAPPNP. We further adopt a multi-teacher knowledge
amalgamation framework, where knowledge from multiple KAN-based GNNs is
distilled into a graph-independent KAN student model. Experiments on benchmark
datasets show that the proposed models improve node classification accuracy,
and the knowledge amalgamation approach significantly boosts student model
performance. Our findings highlight the potential of KANs for enhancing GNN
expressiveness and for enabling efficient, graph-free inference.

Motivation: 随着机器学习中知识产权保护的重要性增加，水印技术受到关注。KAN的独特架构为水印带来新挑战，需要专门的方法。

Method: 提出DCT-AW方法，通过离散余弦变换扰动激活输出来嵌入水印，适用于KAN的可学习激活函数。

Result: 实验表明DCT-AW对模型性能影响小，且对多种水印去除攻击（如微调、剪枝）具有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DCT-AW为KAN提供了一种高效、鲁棒的水印解决方案，适用于复杂网络结构数据。

Abstract: With the increasing importance of protecting intellectual property in machine
learning, watermarking techniques have gained significant attention. As
advanced models are increasingly deployed in domains such as social network
analysis, the need for robust model protection becomes even more critical.
While existing watermarking methods have demonstrated effectiveness for
conventional deep neural networks, they often fail to adapt to the novel
architecture, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), which feature learnable
activation functions. KAN holds strong potential for modeling complex
relationships in network-structured data. However, their unique design also
introduces new challenges for watermarking. Therefore, we propose a novel
watermarking method, Discrete Cosine Transform-based Activation Watermarking
(DCT-AW), tailored for KAN. Leveraging the learnable activation functions of
KAN, our method embeds watermarks by perturbing activation outputs using
discrete cosine transform, ensuring compatibility with diverse tasks and
achieving task independence. Experimental results demonstrate that DCT-AW has a
small impact on model performance and provides superior robustness against
various watermark removal attacks, including fine-tuning, pruning, and
retraining after pruning.

TL;DR: 论文提出HeteRo-Select框架，通过智能选择客户端子集解决联邦学习中数据异构性导致的训练不稳定问题，实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）因客户端数据多样性常导致训练不稳定，现有方法（如Oort）在后期训练中准确率显著下降。

Method: 提出HeteRo-Select框架，基于客户端有用性、公平性、更新速度和数据多样性进行评分选择，理论分析支持其高效性。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，HeteRo-Select峰值准确率74.75%，最终准确率72.76%，稳定性下降仅1.99%，优于Oort。

Conclusion: HeteRo-Select为异构FL问题提供了可靠解决方案，理论和实验均验证其优越性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning technique that often suffers
from training instability due to the diverse nature of client data. Although
utility-based client selection methods like Oort are used to converge by
prioritizing high-loss clients, they frequently experience significant drops in
accuracy during later stages of training. We propose a theoretical
HeteRo-Select framework designed to maintain high performance and ensure
long-term training stability. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that
when client data is very different (high heterogeneity), choosing a smart
subset of client participation can reduce communication more effectively
compared to full participation. Our HeteRo-Select method uses a clear,
step-by-step scoring system that considers client usefulness, fairness, update
speed, and data variety. It also shows convergence guarantees under strong
regularization. Our experimental results on the CIFAR-10 dataset under
significant label skew ($\alpha=0.1$) support the theoretical findings. The
HeteRo-Select method performs better than existing approaches in terms of peak
accuracy, final accuracy, and training stability. Specifically, HeteRo-Select
achieves a peak accuracy of $74.75\%$, a final accuracy of $72.76\%$, and a
minimal stability drop of $1.99\%$. In contrast, Oort records a lower peak
accuracy of $73.98\%$, a final accuracy of $71.25\%$, and a larger stability
drop of $2.73\%$. The theoretical foundations and empirical performance in our
study make HeteRo-Select a reliable solution for real-world heterogeneous FL
problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的物种分布模型（SDMs）通常忽略物种间的生物相互作用，且现有方法对数据完整性和对称性要求较高。

Method: 提出CISO方法，利用深度学习灵活处理不完整的物种观测数据，并结合环境变量进行建模。

Result: 实验表明，CISO在预测物种分布时优于其他方法，尤其是在结合多数据集时表现更佳。

Conclusion: CISO是一种有潜力的生态工具，能够整合不完整生物信息并识别跨类群物种间的潜在相互作用。

Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used to predict species'
geographic distributions, serving as critical tools for ecological research and
conservation planning. Typically, SDMs relate species occurrences to
environmental variables representing abiotic factors, such as temperature,
precipitation, and soil properties. However, species distributions are also
strongly influenced by biotic interactions with other species, which are often
overlooked. While some methods partially address this limitation by
incorporating biotic interactions, they often assume symmetrical pairwise
relationships between species and require consistent co-occurrence data. In
practice, species observations are sparse, and the availability of information
about the presence or absence of other species varies significantly across
locations. To address these challenges, we propose CISO, a deep learning-based
method for species distribution modeling Conditioned on Incomplete Species
Observations. CISO enables predictions to be conditioned on a flexible number
of species observations alongside environmental variables, accommodating the
variability and incompleteness of available biotic data. We demonstrate our
approach using three datasets representing different species groups: sPlotOpen
for plants, SatBird for birds, and a new dataset, SatButterfly, for
butterflies. Our results show that including partial biotic information
improves predictive performance on spatially separate test sets. When
conditioned on a subset of species within the same dataset, CISO outperforms
alternative methods in predicting the distribution of the remaining species.
Furthermore, we show that combining observations from multiple datasets can
improve performance. CISO is a promising ecological tool, capable of
incorporating incomplete biotic information and identifying potential
interactions between species from disparate taxa.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种鲁棒的Lyapunov框架，用于分析Schedule-Free（SF）方法在非凸优化中的性能，证明了其无需依赖总时间T的超参数，并提供了多种收敛速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典一阶方法的收敛保证依赖于预先知道总时间T的步长调度，而SF方法通过结合Polyak-Ruppert平均和动量，实现了超参数与T无关的优化性能，但其非凸分析有限或依赖强全局假设。

Method: 引入鲁棒的Lyapunov框架，仅需L-平滑性和下界性，将SF分析简化为单步下降不等式。

Result: 在非凸设置下，证明了多种收敛速率：常数步长+PR平均为O(1/log T)，线性增长步长为O(log T/T)，多项式平均为O(T^{-(1−α)})。数值实验验证了这些速率。

Conclusion: 研究将SF的无时间T依赖保证扩展到非凸优化，并为未来最优非凸速率的研究提供了方向。

Abstract: First-order methods underpin most large-scale learning algorithms, yet their
classical convergence guarantees hinge on carefully scheduled step-sizes that
depend on the total horizon $T$, which is rarely known in advance. The
Schedule-Free (SF) method promises optimal performance with hyperparameters
that are independent of $T$ by interpolating between Polyak--Ruppert averaging
and momentum, but nonconvex analysis of SF has been limited or reliant on
strong global assumptions. We introduce a robust Lyapunov framework that, under
only $L$-smoothness and lower-boundedness, reduces SF analysis to a single-step
descent inequality. This yields horizon-agnostic bounds in the nonconvex
setting: $O(1/\log T)$ for constant step + PR averaging, $O(\log T/T)$ for a
linearly growing step-size, and a continuum of $O(T^{-(1-\alpha)})$ rates for
polynomial averaging. We complement these proofs with Performance Estimation
Problem (PEP) experiments that numerically validate our rates and suggest that
our $O(1/\log T)$ bound on the original nonconvex SF algorithm may tighten to
$O(1/T)$. Our work extends SF's horizon-free guarantees to smooth nonconvex
optimization and charts future directions for optimal nonconvex rates.

Abstract: Collaboratively fine-tuning (FT) large language models (LLMs) over
heterogeneous mobile devices fosters immense potential applications of
personalized intelligence. However, such a vision faces critical system
challenges. Conventional federated LLM FT approaches place prohibitive
computational and memory burdens on mobile hardware, and their synchronous
model aggregation protocols stall for slower devices. In this paper, we propose
Fed MobiLLM, a novel design to facilitate efficient federated LLM FT across
mobile devices with diverse computing/communication speeds and local model
architectures. In particular, Fed MobiLLM implements a pioneering
server-assisted federated side-tuning paradigm. Briefly, mobile devices perform
lightweight forward propagation computations on local data using their frozen
pre-scaled backbone LLMs, and then upload selected intermediate activations.
The server trains a shared side-network independently, eliminating client-side
backpropagation and enabling asynchronous updates. To bridge model
heterogeneity across different devices, we introduce an adaptive layer-wise
feature alignment method, which ensures consistent representations for
collaboratively tuning a shared side network. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that Fed MobiLLM can maintain robust fine-tuning performance while
achieving extremely low on-device memory, with at least 95.2% reduction in
computation overhead, 93.2% reduction in communication costs and 5.1x faster
convergence compared to existing methods, validating its efficacy for practical
LLM adaptation over heterogeneous mobile devices.

thresholds for drift under a Gaussian null model. These results show that
monitoring right/left null spaces of layer activations and their Fisher
geometry provides concrete, testable guarantees on representational change.

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂系统的实时数字孪生提供了高效、准确的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a framework for constructing real-time digital twins based on
structure-preserving reduced finite element models conditioned on a latent
variable Z. The approach uses conditional attention mechanisms to learn both a
reduced finite element basis and a nonlinear conservation law within the
framework of finite element exterior calculus (FEEC). This guarantees numerical
well-posedness and exact preservation of conserved quantities, regardless of
data sparsity or optimization error. The conditioning mechanism supports
real-time calibration to parametric variables, allowing the construction of
digital twins which support closed loop inference and calibration to sensor
data. The framework interfaces with conventional finite element machinery in a
non-invasive manner, allowing treatment of complex geometries and integration
of learned models with conventional finite element techniques.
  Benchmarks include advection diffusion, shock hydrodynamics, electrostatics,
and a complex battery thermal runaway problem. The method achieves accurate
predictions on complex geometries with sparse data (25 LES simulations),
including capturing the transition to turbulence and achieving real-time
inference ~0.1s with a speedup of 3.1x10^8 relative to LES. An open-source
implementation is available on GitHub.

Motivation: 依赖人类反馈的LLM对齐可能泄露标注者的隐私信息，现有方法（如DP-SGD）提供过度隐私保护且可能降低模型效用。

Method: 提出PROPS框架，利用前一阶段私有对齐模型为后续阶段提供标注数据，结合理论保证和多模型、多数据集验证。

Conclusion: PROPS在保护隐私的同时显著提升LLM对齐的效用，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Alignment is a key step in developing Large Language Models (LLMs) using
human feedback to ensure adherence to human values and societal norms.
Dependence on human feedback raises privacy concerns about how much a labeler's
preferences may reveal about their personal values, beliefs, and personality
traits. Existing approaches, such as Differentially Private SGD (DP-SGD),
provide rigorous privacy guarantees by privatizing gradients during fine-tuning
and alignment but can provide more privacy than necessary as human preferences
are tied only to labels of (prompt, response) pairs and can degrade model
utility. This work focuses on LLM alignment with preference-level privacy,
which preserves the privacy of preference labels provided by humans. We propose
PROPS (PROgressively Private Self-alignment), a multi-stage privacy preserving
alignment framework where privately aligned models in previous stages can serve
as labelers for supplementing training data in the subsequent stages of
alignment. We present theoretical guarantees for PROPS as well as comprehensive
validation using multiple models (Pythia and GPT) and datasets (AlpacaEval,
Anthropic HH-RLHF, truthy-dpo-v0.1) to demonstrate the utility of PROPS over
existing methods while still providing high privacy. For the same privacy
budget, alignment via PROPS can achieve up to 3x higher win-rates compared to
DP-SGD, and 2.5x higher win-rates compared to Randomized Response (RR) based
alignment.

Motivation: 低精度训练虽能降低计算和内存成本，但梯度量化会引入收缩和噪声，影响SGD的收敛行为。

Method: 通过梯度收缩模型分析SGD的收敛性，量化噪声为零均值，收缩因子为$q_k \in (0,1]$。

Result: 低精度SGD仍收敛，但速度减慢，渐进误差增加，收敛速率由$q_{\min}$决定。

Conclusion: 低精度训练通过梯度收缩和噪声影响SGD收敛，需权衡计算效率与收敛性能。

Abstract: Low-precision training has become essential for reducing the computational
and memory costs of large-scale deep learning. However, quantization of
gradients introduces both magnitude shrinkage and additive noise, which can
alter the convergence behavior of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In this
work, we study the convergence of SGD under a gradient shrinkage model, where
each stochastic gradient is scaled by a factor $q_k \in (0,1]$ and perturbed by
zero-mean quantization noise. We show that this shrinkage is equivalent to
replacing the nominal stepsize $\mu_k$ with an effective stepsize $\mu_k q_k$,
which slows convergence when $q_{\min} < 1$. Under standard smoothness and
bounded-variance assumptions, we prove that low-precision SGD still converges,
but at a reduced rate determined by $q_{\min}$, and with an increased
asymptotic error floor due to quantization noise. We theoretically analyze how
reduced numerical precision slows down training by modeling it as gradient
shrinkage in the standard SGD convergence framework.

Motivation: 高维张量数据在自监督学习中面临维度灾难和计算复杂度高的问题，现有方法难以同时处理非线性关系和高效计算。

Conclusion: MA-NTAE通过结合非线性关系和高效计算，为高维张量数据的自监督学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: High-dimensional data, particularly in the form of high-order tensors,
presents a major challenge in self-supervised learning. While MLP-based
autoencoders (AE) are commonly employed, their dependence on flattening
operations exacerbates the curse of dimensionality, leading to excessively
large model sizes, high computational overhead, and challenging optimization
for deep structural feature capture. Although existing tensor networks
alleviate computational burdens through tensor decomposition techniques, most
exhibit limited capability in learning non-linear relationships. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce the Mode-Aware Non-linear Tucker Autoencoder
(MA-NTAE). MA-NTAE generalized classical Tucker decomposition to a non-linear
framework and employs a Pick-and-Unfold strategy, facilitating flexible
per-mode encoding of high-order tensors via recursive unfold-encode-fold
operations, effectively integrating tensor structural priors. Notably, MA-NTAE
exhibits linear growth in computational complexity with tensor order and
proportional growth with mode dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
MA-NTAE's performance advantages over standard AE and current tensor networks
in compression and clustering tasks, which become increasingly pronounced for
higher-order, higher-dimensional tensors.

Conclusion: HARDY-MER通过动态课程学习有效提升了模型对困难样本的处理能力。

Abstract: Missing modalities have recently emerged as a critical research direction in
multimodal emotion recognition (MER). Conventional approaches typically address
this issue through missing modality reconstruction. However, these methods fail
to account for variations in reconstruction difficulty across different
samples, consequently limiting the model's ability to handle hard samples
effectively. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Hardness-Aware
Dynamic Curriculum Learning framework, termed HARDY-MER. Our framework operates
in two key stages: first, it estimates the hardness level of each sample, and
second, it strategically emphasizes hard samples during training to enhance
model performance on these challenging instances. Specifically, we first
introduce a Multi-view Hardness Evaluation mechanism that quantifies
reconstruction difficulty by considering both Direct Hardness (modality
reconstruction errors) and Indirect Hardness (cross-modal mutual information).
Meanwhile, we introduce a Retrieval-based Dynamic Curriculum Learning strategy
that dynamically adjusts the training curriculum by retrieving samples with
similar semantic information and balancing the learning focus between easy and
hard instances. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
HARDY-MER consistently outperforms existing methods in missing-modality
scenarios. Our code will be made publicly available at
https://github.com/HARDY-MER/HARDY-MER.

Result: 实验表明，CFDG在D4RL基准测试（如MuJoCo和AntMaze）中平均性能提升15%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CFDG是一种通用方法，可与现有O2O RL算法结合，显著提升性能且保持稳定性。

Abstract: Offline-to-online Reinforcement Learning (O2O RL) aims to perform online
fine-tuning on an offline pre-trained policy to minimize costly online
interactions. Existing work used offline datasets to generate data that conform
to the online data distribution for data augmentation. However, generated data
still exhibits a gap with the online data, limiting overall performance. To
address this, we propose a new data augmentation approach, Classifier-Free
Diffusion Generation (CFDG). Without introducing additional classifier training
overhead, CFDG leverages classifier-free guidance diffusion to significantly
enhance the generation quality of offline and online data with different
distributions. Additionally, it employs a reweighting method to enable more
generated data to align with the online data, enhancing performance while
maintaining the agent's stability. Experimental results show that CFDG
outperforms replaying the two data types or using a standard diffusion model to
generate new data. Our method is versatile and can be integrated with existing
offline-to-online RL algorithms. By implementing CFDG to popular methods IQL,
PEX and APL, we achieve a notable 15% average improvement in empirical
performance on the D4RL benchmark such as MuJoCo and AntMaze.

*Brendan R. Hogan,Will Brown,Adel Boyarsky,Anderson Schneider,Yuriy Nevmyvaka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种开源方法，将大语言模型（LLMs）适配到Q编程语言（一种在量化金融中流行但互联网上较少见的语言），并通过预训练、监督微调和强化学习训练了一系列模型，性能优于主流前沿模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在Q编程语言等小众或私有领域任务中的表现不佳问题。

Method: 构建Q语言的Leetcode风格评估数据集，基于Qwen-2.5系列模型进行预训练、监督微调和强化学习，训练了五种参数规模的模型。

Result: 最佳模型在Q语言基准测试中达到59%的pass@1准确率，优于Claude Opus-4和GPT-4.1。

Conclusion: 该方法可推广到其他任务，并提供了数据集构建和模型训练的详细指南。

Abstract: Even though large language models are becoming increasingly capable, it is
still unreasonable to expect them to excel at tasks that are under-represented
on the Internet. Leveraging LLMs for specialized applications, particularly in
niche programming languages and private domains, remains challenging and
largely unsolved. In this work, we address this gap by presenting a
comprehensive, open-source approach for adapting LLMs to the Q programming
language, a popular tool in quantitative finance that is much less present on
the Internet compared to Python, C, Java, and other ``mainstream" languages and
is therefore not a strong suit of general-purpose AI models. We introduce a new
Leetcode style evaluation dataset for Q, benchmark major frontier models on the
dataset, then do pretraining, supervised fine tuning, and reinforcement
learning to train a suite of reasoning and non-reasoning models based on the
Qwen-2.5 series, spanning five parameter sizes (1.5B, 3B, 7B, 14B, 32B). Our
best model achieves a pass@1 accuracy of 59 percent on our Q benchmark,
surpassing the best-performing frontier model, Claude Opus-4 by 29.5 percent.
Additionally, all models, even our 1.5B model, outperform GPT-4.1 on this task.
In addition to releasing models, code, and data, we provide a detailed
blueprint for dataset construction, model pretraining, supervised fine-tuning,
and reinforcement learning. Our methodology is broadly applicable, and we
discuss how these techniques can be extended to other tasks, including those
where evaluation may rely on soft or subjective signals.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在神经网络中检测隐藏行为的挑战，提出了一种红蓝对抗框架，并通过实验验证了基于对抗攻击的方法的高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏先验知识和对抗性混淆，检测神经网络中的隐藏行为具有挑战性。

Method: 采用红蓝对抗框架，红队训练两个相似模型（一个仅使用良性数据，另一个包含隐藏有害行为），蓝队尝试识别被篡改的模型。实验使用了CNN和多种蓝队策略。

Result: 基于对抗攻击的方法表现最佳（100%准确率），而其他方法效果参差不齐。在LLM实验中，发现需要关于不良分布的提示才能有效审计。

Conclusion: 开源了审计框架，研究成果有助于设计更好的审计方法。

Abstract: Detecting hidden behaviors in neural networks poses a significant challenge
due to minimal prior knowledge and potential adversarial obfuscation. We
explore this problem by framing detection as an adversarial game between two
teams: the red team trains two similar models, one trained solely on benign
data and the other trained on data containing hidden harmful behavior, with the
performance of both being nearly indistinguishable on the benign dataset. The
blue team, with limited to no information about the harmful behaviour, tries to
identify the compromised model. We experiment using CNNs and try various blue
team strategies, including Gaussian noise analysis, model diffing, integrated
gradients, and adversarial attacks under different levels of hints provided by
the red team. Results show high accuracy for adversarial-attack-based methods
(100\% correct prediction, using hints), which is very promising, whilst the
other techniques yield more varied performance. During our LLM-focused rounds,
we find that there are not many parallel methods that we could apply from our
study with CNNs. Instead, we find that effective LLM auditing methods require
some hints about the undesired distribution, which can then used in standard
black-box and open-weight methods to probe the models further and reveal their
misalignment. We open-source our auditing games (with the model and data) and
hope that our findings contribute to designing better audits.

Motivation: 解决深度强化学习中塑性损失的问题，尤其是在多任务场景下，需要更高的表征灵活性来应对多样且可能冲突的任务需求。

Method: 采用稀疏化方法（Gradual Magnitude Pruning和Sparse Evolutionary Training）在多种MTRL架构（共享主干、专家混合、正交专家混合）上进行实验，并与密集基线和其他塑性增强方法对比。

Result: GMP和SET有效缓解了塑性退化的关键指标（如神经元休眠和表征崩溃），稀疏化代理在多任务性能上优于密集代理，并与显式塑性干预方法竞争。

Conclusion: 动态稀疏化是一种强大但情境敏感的工具，可提升MTRL系统的适应性，揭示了塑性、网络稀疏性和MTRL设计之间的相互作用。

Abstract: Plasticity loss, a diminishing capacity to adapt as training progresses, is a
critical challenge in deep reinforcement learning. We examine this issue in
multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL), where higher representational
flexibility is crucial for managing diverse and potentially conflicting task
demands. We systematically explore how sparsification methods, particularly
Gradual Magnitude Pruning (GMP) and Sparse Evolutionary Training (SET), enhance
plasticity and consequently improve performance in MTRL agents. We evaluate
these approaches across distinct MTRL architectures (shared backbone, Mixture
of Experts, Mixture of Orthogonal Experts) on standardized MTRL benchmarks,
comparing against dense baselines, and a comprehensive range of alternative
plasticity-inducing or regularization methods. Our results demonstrate that
both GMP and SET effectively mitigate key indicators of plasticity degradation,
such as neuron dormancy and representational collapse. These plasticity
improvements often correlate with enhanced multi-task performance, with sparse
agents frequently outperforming dense counterparts and achieving competitive
results against explicit plasticity interventions. Our findings offer insights
into the interplay between plasticity, network sparsity, and MTRL designs,
highlighting dynamic sparsification as a robust but context-sensitive tool for
developing more adaptable MTRL systems.

Abstract: Conformal predictors are machine learning algorithms developed in the 1990's
by Gammerman, Vovk, and their research team, to provide set predictions with
guaranteed confidence level. Over recent years, they have grown in popularity
and have become a mainstream methodology for uncertainty quantification in the
machine learning community. From its beginning, there was an understanding that
they enable reliable machine learning with well-calibrated uncertainty
quantification. This makes them extremely beneficial for developing trustworthy
AI, a topic that has also risen in interest over the past few years, in both
the AI community and society more widely. In this article, we review the
potential for conformal prediction to contribute to trustworthy AI beyond its
marginal validity property, addressing problems such as generalization risk and
AI governance. Experiments and examples are also provided to demonstrate its
use as a well-calibrated predictor and for bias identification and mitigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统模型在数据稀缺场景（如领域迁移或极端条件）下零样本时间序列预测的困难，同时弥补TSPMs缺乏动态整合外部知识的不足。

Method: 提出QuiZSF框架，包括ChronoRAG Base（CRB）用于可扩展存储与检索，Multi-grained Series Interaction Learner（MSIL）提取多粒度特征，以及Model Cooperation Coherer（MCC）对齐检索知识与TSPMs。

Result: QuiZSF在75%和87.5%的预测场景中排名Top1，同时保持高效的内存和推理时间。

Conclusion: QuiZSF通过结合RAG与TSPMs，显著提升了零样本时间序列预测的性能与效率。

Abstract: Time series forecasting has become increasingly important to empower diverse
applications with streaming data. Zero-shot time-series forecasting (ZSF),
particularly valuable in data-scarce scenarios, such as domain transfer or
forecasting under extreme conditions, is difficult for traditional models to
deal with. While time series pre-trained models (TSPMs) have demonstrated
strong performance in ZSF, they often lack mechanisms to dynamically
incorporate external knowledge. Fortunately, emerging retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) offers a promising path for injecting such knowledge on
demand, yet they are rarely integrated with TSPMs. To leverage the strengths of
both worlds, we introduce RAG into TSPMs to enhance zero-shot time series
forecasting. In this paper, we propose QuiZSF (Quick Zero-Shot Time Series
Forecaster), a lightweight and modular framework that couples efficient
retrieval with representation learning and model adaptation for ZSF.
Specifically, we construct a hierarchical tree-structured ChronoRAG Base (CRB)
for scalable time-series storage and domain-aware retrieval, introduce a
Multi-grained Series Interaction Learner (MSIL) to extract fine- and
coarse-grained relational features, and develop a dual-branch Model Cooperation
Coherer (MCC) that aligns retrieved knowledge with two kinds of TSPMs: Non-LLM
based and LLM based. Compared with contemporary baselines, QuiZSF, with Non-LLM
based and LLM based TSPMs as base model, respectively, ranks Top1 in 75% and
87.5% of prediction settings, while maintaining high efficiency in memory and
inference time.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学诊断模型可能因类别特征偏差（即模型依赖与部分类别强相关的特征）导致性能偏差和泛化能力差，需同时解决类别不平衡和类别特征偏差问题。

Method: 提出类别不平等损失，平衡正负类别样本的分类损失贡献；采用类别加权训练目标（分布鲁棒优化），提升不平等损失在类别不平衡下的效果。

Result: 实验证明类别特征偏差会损害模型性能，所提方法能有效缓解偏差和不平衡，提升泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了类别特征偏差和类别不平衡问题，显著提升了模型的泛化性能。

Abstract: Medical diagnosis might fail due to bias. In this work, we identified
class-feature bias, which refers to models' potential reliance on features that
are strongly correlated with only a subset of classes, leading to biased
performance and poor generalization on other classes. We aim to train a
class-unbiased model (Cls-unbias) that mitigates both class imbalance and
class-feature bias simultaneously. Specifically, we propose a class-wise
inequality loss which promotes equal contributions of classification loss from
positive-class and negative-class samples. We propose to optimize a class-wise
group distributionally robust optimization objective-a class-weighted training
objective that upweights underperforming classes-to enhance the effectiveness
of the inequality loss under class imbalance. Through synthetic and real-world
datasets, we empirically demonstrate that class-feature bias can negatively
impact model performance. Our proposed method effectively mitigates both
class-feature bias and class imbalance, thereby improving the model's
generalization ability.

Motivation: 传统两阶段方法（SFT+RL）存在灾难性遗忘和探索-模仿权衡问题，而现有单阶段方法缺乏动态平衡机制。

Method: 提出AMFT算法，通过元梯度自适应权重控制器动态优化SFT和RL的平衡，并结合策略熵正则化以保持稳定性。

Result: 在数学推理、抽象视觉推理和视觉语言导航等任务上，AMFT均达到最优性能，并表现出更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: AMFT通过动态平衡SFT和RL，提供了一种更有效和稳定的LLM对齐范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically fine-tuned for reasoning tasks
through a two-stage pipeline of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by
Reinforcement Learning (RL), a process fraught with catastrophic forgetting and
suboptimal trade-offs between imitation and exploration. Recent single-stage
methods attempt to unify SFT and RL using heuristics, but lack a principled
mechanism for dynamically balancing the two paradigms. In this paper, we
reframe this challenge through the theoretical lens of \textbf{implicit
rewards}, viewing SFT and RL not as distinct methods but as complementary
reward signals. We introduce \textbf{Adaptive Meta Fine-Tuning (AMFT)}, a novel
single-stage algorithm that learns the optimal balance between SFT's implicit,
path-level reward and RL's explicit, outcome-based reward. The core of AMFT is
a \textbf{meta-gradient adaptive weight controller} that treats the SFT-RL
balance as a learnable parameter, dynamically optimizing it to maximize
long-term task performance. This forward-looking approach, regularized by
policy entropy for stability, autonomously discovers an effective training
curriculum. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on challenging benchmarks
spanning mathematical reasoning, abstract visual reasoning (General Points),
and vision-language navigation (V-IRL). AMFT consistently establishes a new
state-of-the-art and demonstrats superior generalization on out-of-distribution
(OOD) tasks. Ablation studies and training dynamic analysis confirm that the
meta-learning controller is crucial for AMFT's stability, sample efficiency,
and performance, offering a more principled and effective paradigm for LLM
alignment.Our codes are open-sourced via https://github.com/hlxtsyj/AMFT.

TL;DR: BoRA是一种改进的LoRA方法，通过块矩阵乘法和引入对角矩阵，以少量额外参数提升低秩权重矩阵的秩，从而提高微调性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA在大型语言模型中广泛使用，但增加秩会显著增加可训练参数数量。BoRA旨在以更少的参数提升秩，从而优化性能。

Method: BoRA将LoRA的权重矩阵分解为块矩阵，并为每个块乘法引入独特的对角矩阵，从而增加秩而不显著增加参数。

Result: 实验表明，BoRA在多个数据集和模型上表现优越，且具有可扩展性。

Conclusion: BoRA通过块多样化的低秩适应，以较少的额外参数显著提升了LoRA的性能。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method
widely used in large language models (LLMs). It approximates the update of a
pretrained weight matrix $W\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ by the product of two
low-rank matrices, $BA$, where $A \in\mathbb{R}^{r\times n}$ and
$B\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times r} (r\ll\min\{m,n\})$. Increasing the dimension $r$
can raise the rank of LoRA weights (i.e., $BA$), which typically improves
fine-tuning performance but also significantly increases the number of
trainable parameters. In this paper, we propose Block Diversified Low-Rank
Adaptation (BoRA), which improves the rank of LoRA weights with a small number
of additional parameters. Specifically, BoRA treats the product $BA$ as a block
matrix multiplication, where $A$ and $B$ are partitioned into $b$ blocks along
the columns and rows, respectively (i.e., $A=[A_1,\dots,A_b]$ and
$B=[B_1,\dots,B_b]^\top$). Consequently, the product $BA$ becomes the
concatenation of the block products $B_iA_j$ for $i,j\in[b]$. To enhance the
diversity of different block products, BoRA introduces a unique diagonal matrix
$\Sigma_{i,j} \in \mathbb{R}^{r\times r}$ for each block multiplication,
resulting in $B_i \Sigma_{i,j} A_j$. By leveraging these block-wise diagonal
matrices, BoRA increases the rank of LoRA weights by a factor of $b$ while only
requiring $b^2r$ additional parameters. Extensive experiments across multiple
datasets and models demonstrate the superiority of BoRA, and ablation studies
further validate its scalability.

Abstract: Remote sensing provides satellite data in diverse types and formats. The
usage of multimodal learning networks exploits this diversity to improve model
performance, except that the complexity of such networks comes at the expense
of their interpretability. In this study, we explore how modalities can be
leveraged through multitask learning to intrinsically explain model behavior.
In particular, instead of additional inputs, we use certain modalities as
additional targets to be predicted along with the main task. The success of
this approach relies on the rich information content of satellite data, which
remains as input modalities. We show how this modeling context provides
numerous benefits: (1) in case of data scarcity, the additional modalities do
not need to be collected for model inference at deployment, (2) the model
performance remains comparable to the multimodal baseline performance, and in
some cases achieves better scores, (3) prediction errors in the main task can
be explained via the model behavior in the auxiliary task(s). We demonstrate
the efficiency of our approach on three datasets, including segmentation,
classification, and regression tasks. Code available at

Motivation: 电池研发因原型设计和寿命测试的高成本而受限，现有数据驱动方法需目标设计的标记数据且效率不足。

Method: DL整合主动学习、物理引导学习和零样本学习，利用历史电池设计数据减少原型需求，实现快速寿命评估。

Result: DL在未观测材料设计组合中预测寿命的测试误差为7.2%，相比工业实践节省98%时间和95%能源。

Conclusion: DL展示了从历史设计中提取洞察以加速下一代电池技术开发的潜力，是数据驱动建模的重要进展。

Abstract: Fast and reliable validation of novel designs in complex physical systems
such as batteries is critical to accelerating technological innovation.
However, battery research and development remain bottlenecked by the
prohibitively high time and energy costs required to evaluate numerous new
design candidates, particularly in battery prototyping and life testing.
Despite recent progress in data-driven battery lifetime prediction, existing
methods require labeled data of target designs to improve accuracy and cannot
make reliable predictions until after prototyping, thus falling far short of
the efficiency needed to enable rapid feedback for battery design. Here, we
introduce Discovery Learning (DL), a scientific machine-learning paradigm that
integrates active learning, physics-guided learning, and zero-shot learning
into a human-like reasoning loop, drawing inspiration from learning theories in
educational psychology. DL can learn from historical battery designs and
actively reduce the need for prototyping, thus enabling rapid lifetime
evaluation for unobserved material-design combinations without requiring
additional data labeling. To test DL, we present 123 industrial-grade
large-format lithium-ion pouch cells, spanning eight material-design
combinations and diverse cycling protocols. Trained solely on public datasets
of small-capacity cylindrical cells, DL achieves 7.2% test error in predicting
the average cycle life under unknown device variability. This results in
savings of 98% in time and 95% in energy compared to industrial practices. This
work highlights the potential of uncovering insights from historical designs to
inform and accelerate the development of next-generation battery technologies.
DL represents a key advance toward efficient data-driven modeling and helps
realize the promise of machine learning for accelerating scientific discovery
and engineering innovation.

Conclusion: UniMove是实现人类移动预测统一基础模型的重要进展。

Abstract: Human mobility prediction is vital for urban planning, transportation
optimization, and personalized services. However, the inherent randomness,
non-uniform time intervals, and complex patterns of human mobility, compounded
by the heterogeneity introduced by varying city structures, infrastructure, and
population densities, present significant challenges in modeling. Existing
solutions often require training separate models for each city due to distinct
spatial representations and geographic coverage. In this paper, we propose
UniMove, a unified model for multi-city human mobility prediction, addressing
two challenges: (1) constructing universal spatial representations for
effective token sharing across cities, and (2) modeling heterogeneous mobility
patterns from varying city characteristics. We propose a trajectory-location
dual-tower architecture, with a location tower for universal spatial encoding
and a trajectory tower for sequential mobility modeling. We also design MoE
Transformer blocks to adaptively select experts to handle diverse movement
patterns. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets from diverse cities
demonstrate that UniMove truly embodies the essence of a unified model. By
enabling joint training on multi-city data with mutual data enhancement, it
significantly improves mobility prediction accuracy by over 10.2\%. UniMove
represents a key advancement toward realizing a true foundational model with a
unified architecture for human mobility. We release the implementation at

Motivation: Tsetlin机器（TM）缺乏特征重要性评估工具，本文旨在填补这一空白，提升TM的模型可解释性和性能。

Result: TM内部评分方法性能优越，能揭示特征交互模式，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: 本研究为TM的特征选择建立了首个全面基线，为开发专用可解释性技术奠定了基础。

Abstract: Feature Selection (FS) is crucial for improving model interpretability,
reducing complexity, and sometimes for enhancing accuracy. The recently
introduced Tsetlin machine (TM) offers interpretable clause-based learning, but
lacks established tools for estimating feature importance. In this paper, we
adapt and evaluate a range of FS techniques for TMs, including classical filter
and embedded methods as well as post-hoc explanation methods originally
developed for neural networks (e.g., SHAP and LIME) and a novel family of
embedded scorers derived from TM clause weights and Tsetlin automaton (TA)
states. We benchmark all methods across 12 datasets, using evaluation
protocols, like Remove and Retrain (ROAR) strategy and Remove and Debias
(ROAD), to assess causal impact. Our results show that TM-internal scorers not
only perform competitively but also exploit the interpretability of clauses to
reveal interacting feature patterns. Simpler TM-specific scorers achieve
similar accuracy retention at a fraction of the computational cost. This study
establishes the first comprehensive baseline for FS in TM and paves the way for
developing specialized TM-specific interpretability techniques.

Conclusion: 多专家协作中，动态选择专家子集是有效的，贪婪算法提供了一种实用解决方案。

Abstract: Decision support systems are designed to assist human experts in
classification tasks by providing conformal prediction sets derived from a
pre-trained model. This human-AI collaboration has demonstrated enhanced
classification performance compared to using either the model or the expert
independently. In this study, we focus on the selection of instance-specific
experts from a pool of multiple human experts, contrasting it with existing
research that typically focuses on single-expert scenarios. We characterize the
conditions under which multiple experts can benefit from the conformal sets.
With the insight that only certain experts may be relevant for each instance,
we explore the problem of subset selection and introduce a greedy algorithm
that utilizes conformal sets to identify the subset of expert predictions that
will be used in classifying an instance. This approach is shown to yield better
performance compared to naive methods for human subset selection. Based on real
expert predictions from the CIFAR-10H and ImageNet-16H datasets, our simulation
study indicates that our proposed greedy algorithm achieves near-optimal
subsets, resulting in improved classification performance among multiple
experts.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于时间滞后交叉相关性的序列预测框架（TLCCSP），通过整合时间滞后相关序列提升预测精度，实验证明其在天气、金融和房地产数据集上显著降低了均方误差（MSE）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型常忽略时间滞后交叉相关性，而这些相关性对捕捉复杂时序关系至关重要。

Method: TLCCSP框架采用序列移位动态时间规整（SSDTW）算法捕获滞后相关性，并结合对比学习编码器（CLE）高效近似SSDTW距离。

Result: 在天气、金融和房地产数据集上，SSDTW和CLE分别显著降低了MSE（如天气数据中分别降低16.01%和17.88%），且CLE将SSDTW计算时间减少约99%。

Conclusion: TLCCSP框架通过整合时间滞后交叉相关性和对比学习，显著提升了预测精度和计算效率，适用于多领域时间序列预测任务。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is critical across various domains, such as weather,
finance and real estate forecasting, as accurate forecasts support informed
decision-making and risk mitigation. While recent deep learning models have
improved predictive capabilities, they often overlook time-lagged
cross-correlations between related sequences, which are crucial for capturing
complex temporal relationships. To address this, we propose the Time-Lagged
Cross-Correlations-based Sequence Prediction framework (TLCCSP), which enhances
forecasting accuracy by effectively integrating time-lagged cross-correlated
sequences. TLCCSP employs the Sequence Shifted Dynamic Time Warping (SSDTW)
algorithm to capture lagged correlations and a contrastive learning-based
encoder to efficiently approximate SSDTW distances.
  Experimental results on weather, finance and real estate time series datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. On the weather dataset, SSDTW
reduces mean squared error (MSE) by 16.01% compared with single-sequence
methods, while the contrastive learning encoder (CLE) further decreases MSE by
17.88%. On the stock dataset, SSDTW achieves a 9.95% MSE reduction, and CLE
reduces it by 6.13%. For the real estate dataset, SSDTW and CLE reduce MSE by
21.29% and 8.62%, respectively. Additionally, the contrastive learning approach
decreases SSDTW computational time by approximately 99%, ensuring scalability
and real-time applicability across multiple time series forecasting tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合行为克隆（BC）和离线强化学习（CQL）的管道，显著提升了自动驾驶策略的鲁棒性和成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决行为克隆策略在闭环执行中易受复合错误影响的问题，探索从静态专家数据中学习鲁棒驾驶策略的方法。

Method: 开发了基于Transformer的BC基线模型，并应用CQL算法优化策略，结合精心设计的奖励函数。

Result: 在Waymo数据集上，CQL策略的成功率比最强BC基线高3.2倍，碰撞率低7.4倍。

Conclusion: 离线强化学习是从静态数据中学习鲁棒、长期驾驶策略的关键方法。

Abstract: Learning robust driving policies from large-scale, real-world datasets is a
central challenge in autonomous driving, as online data collection is often
unsafe and impractical. While Behavioral Cloning (BC) offers a straightforward
approach to imitation learning, policies trained with BC are notoriously
brittle and suffer from compounding errors in closed-loop execution. This work
presents a comprehensive pipeline and a comparative study to address this
limitation. We first develop a series of increasingly sophisticated BC
baselines, culminating in a Transformer-based model that operates on a
structured, entity-centric state representation. While this model achieves low
imitation loss, we show that it still fails in long-horizon simulations. We
then demonstrate that by applying a state-of-the-art Offline Reinforcement
Learning algorithm, Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), to the same data and
architecture, we can learn a significantly more robust policy. Using a
carefully engineered reward function, the CQL agent learns a conservative value
function that enables it to recover from minor errors and avoid
out-of-distribution states. In a large-scale evaluation on 1,000 unseen
scenarios from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, our final CQL agent achieves a
3.2x higher success rate and a 7.4x lower collision rate than the strongest BC
baseline, proving that an offline RL approach is critical for learning robust,
long-horizon driving policies from static expert data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种阶段感知的混合专家框架（IGND-MoE），用于建模神经退行性疾病的动态进展，结合了时间依赖的专家权重和灵活的图扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经退行性疾病的进展建模面临纵向数据稀缺和病理机制复杂性的挑战，传统模型假设固定机制，无法捕捉阶段特异性。

Method: 采用阶段感知的混合专家框架（MoE），结合时间依赖的专家权重、非均匀图神经扩散模型（IGND）和局部神经反应模块。

Result: 模型动态整合了不同阶段的病理机制，发现图相关过程在早期更显著，而其他未知过程在后期占主导。

Conclusion: IGND-MoE为理解神经退行性疾病的阶段特异性机制提供了新方法，临床结果与文献一致。

Abstract: The long-term progression of neurodegenerative diseases is commonly
conceptualized as a spatiotemporal diffusion process that consists of a graph
diffusion process across the structural brain connectome and a localized
reaction process within brain regions. However, modeling this progression
remains challenging due to 1) the scarcity of longitudinal data obtained
through irregular and infrequent subject visits and 2) the complex interplay of
pathological mechanisms across brain regions and disease stages, where
traditional models assume fixed mechanisms throughout disease progression. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel stage-aware Mixture of Experts
(MoE) framework that explicitly models how different contributing mechanisms
dominate at different disease stages through time-dependent expert
weighting.Data-wise, we utilize an iterative dual optimization method to
properly estimate the temporal position of individual observations,
constructing a co hort-level progression trajectory from irregular snapshots.
Model-wise, we enhance the spatial component with an inhomogeneous graph neural
diffusion model (IGND) that allows diffusivity to vary based on node states and
time, providing more flexible representations of brain networks. We also
introduce a localized neural reaction module to capture complex dynamics beyond
standard processes.The resulting IGND-MoE model dynamically integrates these
components across temporal states, offering a principled way to understand how
stage-specific pathological mechanisms contribute to progression. The
stage-wise weights yield novel clinical insights that align with literature,
suggesting that graph-related processes are more influential at early stages,
while other unknown physical processes become dominant later on.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中，环境因素（如风况变化或电磁干扰）可能导致未观测到的噪声统计漂移，导致学习型方法性能下降。

Method: OTAKNet通过一步预测测量似然建立状态估计与漂移之间的联系，并利用最优传输的几何感知成本和稳定梯度实现完全在线适应。

Result: 在合成和真实NCLT数据集上，OTAKNet表现优于传统模型自适应卡尔曼滤波和离线学习型滤波，尤其是在训练数据有限的情况下。

Conclusion: OTAKNet是首个针对噪声统计漂移的在线学习型解决方案，展示了在动态环境中的强大适应能力。

Abstract: Learning-based filtering has demonstrated strong performance in non-linear
dynamical systems, particularly when the statistics of noise are unknown.
However, in real-world deployments, environmental factors, such as changing
wind conditions or electromagnetic interference, can induce unobserved
noise-statistics drift, leading to substantial degradation of learning-based
methods. To address this challenge, we propose OTAKNet, the first online
solution to noise-statistics drift within learning-based adaptive Kalman
filtering. Unlike existing learning-based methods that perform offline
fine-tuning using batch pointwise matching over entire trajectories, OTAKNet
establishes a connection between the state estimate and the drift via one-step
predictive measurement likelihood, and addresses it using optimal transport.
This leverages OT's geometry - aware cost and stable gradients to enable fully
online adaptation without ground truth labels or retraining. We compare OTAKNet
against classical model-based adaptive Kalman filtering and offline
learning-based filtering. The performance is demonstrated on both synthetic and
real-world NCLT datasets, particularly under limited training data.

Motivation: 减轻大型语言模型的高计算需求，但发现学生模型可能继承教师模型的隐私风险。

Method: 系统分析了六种LLM KD技术，涵盖七个NLP任务、三种教师模型家族（GPT-2、LLAMA-2、OPT）和不同规模的学生模型。

Result: 所有KD方法均存在隐私风险，但程度不同；记忆与成员隐私风险存在显著不一致；不同模块的隐私风险差异较大。

Conclusion: KD技术的隐私风险需进一步研究，尤其是在不同组件和任务中的表现。

Abstract: Recent advances in Knowledge Distillation (KD) aim to mitigate the high
computational demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) by transferring knowledge
from a large ''teacher'' to a smaller ''student'' model. However, students may
inherit the teacher's privacy when the teacher is trained on private data. In
this work, we systematically characterize and investigate membership and
memorization privacy risks inherent in six LLM KD techniques. Using
instruction-tuning settings that span seven NLP tasks, together with three
teacher model families (GPT-2, LLAMA-2, and OPT), and various size student
models, we demonstrate that all existing LLM KD approaches carry membership and
memorization privacy risks from the teacher to its students. However, the
extent of privacy risks varies across different KD techniques. We
systematically analyse how key LLM KD components (KD objective functions,
student training data and NLP tasks) impact such privacy risks. We also
demonstrate a significant disagreement between memorization and membership
privacy risks of LLM KD techniques. Finally, we characterize per-block privacy
risk and demonstrate that the privacy risk varies across different blocks by a
large margin.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于“先遗忘后学习”策略的知识编辑方法，通过参数高效微调技术（$IA^3$）解决大语言模型（LLMs）动态知识更新中的冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在动态更新知识时，尤其是新旧知识冲突时，容易产生对新知识的抵抗和无关知识的严重遗忘。

Method: 采用两阶段策略：1）定位冲突知识编码的内部组件；2）通过$IA^3$技术进行“先遗忘后学习”的微调。

Result: 实验显示，该方法对新知识的准确率接近完美（98.50%），同时有效抑制原冲突知识（96.00%遗忘率），并显著减少灾难性遗忘（72.00% F_control准确率）。

Conclusion: 该方法在紧凑型LLMs中实现了精确、局部化和安全的知识管理，是知识编辑领域的重大进展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with dynamic knowledge updates,
especially when new information conflicts with deeply embedded facts. Such
conflicting factual edits often lead to two critical issues: resistance to
adopting the new fact and severe catastrophic forgetting of unrelated
knowledge. This paper introduces and evaluates a novel "unlearn-then-learn"
strategy for precise knowledge editing in LLMs, leveraging the
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) technique, Infused Adapter by Inhibiting
and Amplifying Inner Activations ($IA^3$). Crucially, this two-stage approach
is powered by an initial circuit localization phase that identifies and targets
the specific internal components responsible for encoding the conflicting fact.
Through a rigorous experimental methodology on
microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct, we demonstrate that this mechanistically
informed two-stage approach achieves near-perfect accuracy (98.50%) for the
new, modulated fact while simultaneously effectively suppressing the original
conflicting fact (96.00% forget rate). Critically, our strategy exhibits
unprecedented localization (72.00% F_control accuracy), dramatically mitigating
catastrophic forgetting observed in direct fine-tuning approaches (which showed
as low as ~20% F_control accuracy), a direct benefit of our targeted
interpretability-guided intervention. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals
a nuanced mechanism of "soft forgetting," where original knowledge is
suppressed from default retrieval but remains latent and conditionally
accessible, enhancing model safety and control. These findings represent a
significant advancement towards precise, localized, and safe knowledge
management in compact LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概念漂移（数据分布的逐渐或突然变化）会显著降低模型性能，现有检测方法多为被动且对早期检测不敏感。

Method: 采用Transformer和Autoencoder建模复杂时序动态，结合Trust Score方法（包括统计、重构、预测不确定性、规则违反等指标）进行在线漂移检测。

Result: 在航空乘客数据集上，该框架比传统方法更早、更敏感地检测到漂移，并减少了错误率和逻辑违反。

Conclusion: 开发了一个鲁棒的框架，可可靠地监控概念漂移。

Abstract: In applied machine learning, concept drift, which is either gradual or abrupt
changes in data distribution, can significantly reduce model performance.
Typical detection methods,such as statistical tests or reconstruction-based
models,are generally reactive and not very sensitive to early detection. Our
study proposes a hybrid framework consisting of Transformers and Autoencoders
to model complex temporal dynamics and provide online drift detection. We
create a distinct Trust Score methodology, which includes signals on (1)
statistical and reconstruction-based drift metrics, more specifically, PSI,
JSD, Transformer-AE error, (2) prediction uncertainty, (3) rules violations,
and (4) trend of classifier error aligned with the combined metrics defined by
the Trust Score. Using a time sequenced airline passenger data set with
synthetic drift, our proposed model allows for a better detection of drift
using as a whole and at different detection thresholds for both sensitivity and
interpretability compared to baseline methods and provides a strong pipeline
for drift detection in real time for applied machine learning. We evaluated
performance using a time-sequenced airline passenger dataset having the
gradually injected stimulus of drift in expectations,e.g. permuted ticket
prices in later batches, broken into 10 time segments [1].In the data, our
results support that the Transformation-Autoencoder detected drift earlier and
with more sensitivity than the autoencoders commonly used in the literature,
and provided improved modeling over more error rates and logical violations.
Therefore, a robust framework was developed to reliably monitor concept drift.

Motivation: 生成建模在无模拟范式（如Flow Matching和MeanFlow）中取得了显著进展，但需要进一步扩展以支持更丰富的动态和高效的采样。

Method: 通过引入平均加速度场，提出Second-Order MeanFlow，证明其满足广义一致性条件，并通过电路复杂度分析展示其表达能力。

Result: 证明了Second-Order MeanFlow可实现高效单步采样，其采样过程可由TC^0类电路实现，且注意力操作可高效近似。

Conclusion: 这些结果为高阶流匹配模型奠定了理论基础，结合了丰富的动态特性和实际采样效率。

Abstract: Generative modelling has seen significant advances through simulation-free
paradigms such as Flow Matching, and in particular, the MeanFlow framework,
which replaces instantaneous velocity fields with average velocities to enable
efficient single-step sampling. In this work, we introduce a theoretical study
on Second-Order MeanFlow, a novel extension that incorporates average
acceleration fields into the MeanFlow objective. We first establish the
feasibility of our approach by proving that the average acceleration satisfies
a generalized consistency condition analogous to first-order MeanFlow, thereby
supporting stable, one-step sampling and tractable loss functions. We then
characterize its expressivity via circuit complexity analysis, showing that
under mild assumptions, the Second-Order MeanFlow sampling process can be
implemented by uniform threshold circuits within the $\mathsf{TC}^0$ class.
Finally, we derive provably efficient criteria for scalable implementation by
leveraging fast approximate attention computations: we prove that attention
operations within the Second-Order MeanFlow architecture can be approximated to
within $1/\mathrm{poly}(n)$ error in time $n^{2+o(1)}$. Together, these results
lay the theoretical foundation for high-order flow matching models that combine
rich dynamics with practical sampling efficiency.

Motivation: fMRI信号的功能连接动态可能与行为和神经精神疾病相关，但传统GNN难以捕捉动态fMRI数据中的长程时间依赖。

Method: 提出BrainATCL框架，动态调整每个快照的回溯窗口，并使用GINE-Mamba2骨干编码图序列，结合脑结构和功能信息边缘属性。

Result: 在功能连接预测和年龄估计任务中表现出优越性能，并具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: BrainATCL为动态fMRI数据分析提供了有效工具，能够捕捉生物意义拓扑模式。

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an imaging technique widely
used to study human brain activity. fMRI signals in areas across the brain
transiently synchronise and desynchronise their activity in a highly structured
manner, even when an individual is at rest. These functional connectivity
dynamics may be related to behaviour and neuropsychiatric disease. To model
these dynamics, temporal brain connectivity representations are essential, as
they reflect evolving interactions between brain regions and provide insight
into transient neural states and network reconfigurations. However,
conventional graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle to capture long-range
temporal dependencies in dynamic fMRI data. To address this challenge, we
propose BrainATCL, an unsupervised, nonparametric framework for adaptive
temporal brain connectivity learning, enabling functional link prediction and
age estimation. Our method dynamically adjusts the lookback window for each
snapshot based on the rate of newly added edges. Graph sequences are
subsequently encoded using a GINE-Mamba2 backbone to learn spatial-temporal
representations of dynamic functional connectivity in resting-state fMRI data
of 1,000 participants from the Human Connectome Project. To further improve
spatial modeling, we incorporate brain structure and function-informed edge
attributes, i.e., the left/right hemispheric identity and subnetwork membership
of brain regions, enabling the model to capture biologically meaningful
topological patterns. We evaluate our BrainATCL on two tasks: functional link
prediction and age estimation. The experimental results demonstrate superior
performance and strong generalization, including in cross-session prediction
scenarios.

Motivation: 解决现有分类器在极端情况下预测准确率低的问题，并通过数学理论支持多实例学习（MIL）的优越性。

Method: 基于多实例学习（MIL）的方法，分析其在不同实例数量下的缩放行为，并将其应用于标准模型有效场论（SMEFT）的约束。

Result: 在特定条件下，可能从数据集中提取理论最大Fisher信息，验证了MIL方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MIL方法在提升预测精度和判别能力方面具有潜力，尤其在复杂物理问题中表现突出。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a new machine learning (ML) methodology to obtain
more precise predictions for some parameters of interest in a given hypotheses
testing problem. Our proposed method also allows ML models to have more
discriminative power in cases where it is extremely challenging for
state-of-the-art classifiers to have any level of accurate predictions. This
method can also allow us to systematically decrease the error from ML models in
their predictions. In this paper, we provide a mathematical motivation why
Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) would have more predictive power over their
single-instance counterparts. We support our theoretical claims by analyzing
the behavior of the MIL models through their scaling behaviors with respect to
the number of instances on which the model makes predictions. As a concrete
application, we constrain Wilson coefficients of the Standard Model Effective
Field Theory (SMEFT) using kinematic information from subatomic particle
collision events at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We show that under certain
circumstances, it might be possible to extract the theoretical maximum Fisher
Information latent in a dataset.

Motivation: 现有GNN解释方法难以生成细粒度、可解释的理性解释，尤其是在节点属性包含丰富自然语言时。

Method: LOGIC将GNN节点嵌入投影到LLM嵌入空间，构建混合提示（软提示与文本输入结合），使LLM能推理GNN内部表示并生成自然语言解释和子图。

Result: 在四个真实TAG数据集上，LOGIC在保真度和稀疏性间取得平衡，并显著提升人类中心指标（如洞察力）。

Conclusion: LOGIC为基于LLM的图学习可解释性设定了新方向，通过将GNN内部与人类推理对齐。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning over
structured data, including text-attributed graphs, which are common in domains
such as citation networks, social platforms, and knowledge graphs. GNNs are not
inherently interpretable and thus, many explanation methods have been proposed.
However, existing explanation methods often struggle to generate interpretable,
fine-grained rationales, especially when node attributes include rich natural
language. In this work, we introduce LOGIC, a lightweight, post-hoc framework
that uses large language models (LLMs) to generate faithful and interpretable
explanations for GNN predictions. LOGIC projects GNN node embeddings into the
LLM embedding space and constructs hybrid prompts that interleave soft prompts
with textual inputs from the graph structure. This enables the LLM to reason
about GNN internal representations and produce natural language explanations
along with concise explanation subgraphs. Our experiments across four
real-world TAG datasets demonstrate that LOGIC achieves a favorable trade-off
between fidelity and sparsity, while significantly improving human-centric
metrics such as insightfulness. LOGIC sets a new direction for LLM-based
explainability in graph learning by aligning GNN internals with human
reasoning.

Motivation: 分布式后端系统中多级服务调用结构的性能波动预测是一个挑战，现有方法难以准确建模时空依赖关系。

Method: 将系统状态抽象为图结构序列，结合运行时特征和服务调用关系，构建统一的时空建模框架，使用图卷积网络和高门控循环网络分别提取拓扑依赖和时间动态信息。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在MAE、RMSE和R2等关键指标上优于现有方法，并在不同负载和结构复杂度下保持强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在后台服务性能管理任务中具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper proposes a spatiotemporal graph neural network-based performance
prediction algorithm to address the challenge of forecasting performance
fluctuations in distributed backend systems with multi-level service call
structures. The method abstracts system states at different time slices into a
sequence of graph structures. It integrates the runtime features of service
nodes with the invocation relationships among services to construct a unified
spatiotemporal modeling framework. The model first applies a graph
convolutional network to extract high-order dependency information from the
service topology. Then it uses a gated recurrent network to capture the dynamic
evolution of performance metrics over time. A time encoding mechanism is also
introduced to enhance the model's ability to represent non-stationary temporal
sequences. The architecture is trained in an end-to-end manner, optimizing the
multi-layer nested structure to achieve high-precision regression of future
service performance metrics. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed
method, a large-scale public cluster dataset is used. A series of
multi-dimensional experiments are designed, including variations in time
windows and concurrent load levels. These experiments comprehensively evaluate
the model's predictive performance and stability. The experimental results show
that the proposed model outperforms existing representative methods across key
metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R2. It maintains strong robustness under varying
load intensities and structural complexities. These results demonstrate the
model's practical potential for backend service performance management tasks.

Result: 在三个挑战性环境中，Pref-GUIDE显著优于标量反馈基线，投票版本甚至超过专家设计的密集奖励。

Conclusion: Pref-GUIDE通过结构化偏好和群体反馈，为在线强化学习中利用人类输入提供了可扩展且原则性的方法。

Abstract: Training reinforcement learning agents with human feedback is crucial when
task objectives are difficult to specify through dense reward functions. While
prior methods rely on offline trajectory comparisons to elicit human
preferences, such data is unavailable in online learning scenarios where agents
must adapt on the fly. Recent approaches address this by collecting real-time
scalar feedback to guide agent behavior and train reward models for continued
learning after human feedback becomes unavailable. However, scalar feedback is
often noisy and inconsistent, limiting the accuracy and generalization of
learned rewards. We propose Pref-GUIDE, a framework that transforms real-time
scalar feedback into preference-based data to improve reward model learning for
continual policy training. Pref-GUIDE Individual mitigates temporal
inconsistency by comparing agent behaviors within short windows and filtering
ambiguous feedback. Pref-GUIDE Voting further enhances robustness by
aggregating reward models across a population of users to form consensus
preferences. Across three challenging environments, Pref-GUIDE significantly
outperforms scalar-feedback baselines, with the voting variant exceeding even
expert-designed dense rewards. By reframing scalar feedback as structured
preferences with population feedback, Pref-GUIDE offers a scalable and
principled approach for harnessing human input in online reinforcement
learning.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) prediction remains a tremendous challenge due to
its multifactorial etiology and global burden of morbidity and mortality.
Despite the growing availability of genomic and electrophysiological data,
extracting biologically meaningful insights from such high-dimensional, noisy,
and sparsely annotated datasets remains a non-trivial task. Recently, LLMs has
been applied effectively to predict structural variations in biological
sequences. In this work, we explore the potential of fine-tuned LLMs to predict
cardiac diseases and SNPs potentially leading to CVD risk using genetic markers
derived from high-throughput genomic profiling. We investigate the effect of
genetic patterns associated with cardiac conditions and evaluate how LLMs can
learn latent biological relationships from structured and semi-structured
genomic data obtained by mapping genetic aspects that are inherited from the
family tree. By framing the problem as a Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning task,
the models are prompted to generate disease labels and articulate informed
clinical deductions across diverse patient profiles and phenotypes. The
findings highlight the promise of LLMs in contributing to early detection, risk
assessment, and ultimately, the advancement of personalized medicine in cardiac
care.

Abstract: Semi-Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (semi-NMF) extends classical
Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) by allowing the basis matrix to contain
both positive and negative entries, making it suitable for decomposing data
with mixed signs. However, most existing semi-NMF algorithms are iterative,
non-convex, and prone to local minima. In this paper, we propose a novel method
that yields a globally optimal solution to the semi-NMF problem under the
Frobenius norm, through an orthogonal decomposition derived from the scatter
matrix of the input data. We rigorously prove that our solution attains the
global minimum of the reconstruction error. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
when the input matrix is nonnegative, our method often achieves lower
reconstruction error than standard NMF algorithms, although unfortunately the
basis matrix may not satisfy nonnegativity. In particular, in low-rank cases
such as rank 1 or 2, our solution reduces exactly to a nonnegative
factorization, recovering the NMF structure. We validate our approach through
experiments on both synthetic data and the UCI Wine dataset, showing that our
method consistently outperforms existing NMF and semi-NMF methods in terms of
reconstruction accuracy. These results confirm that our globally optimal,
non-iterative formulation offers both theoretical guarantees and empirical
advantages, providing a new perspective on matrix factorization in optimization
and data analysis.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的损失函数，解决了DPO方法中因无限最大化对数差导致的不稳定和奖励黑客问题，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO方法在理论上与其推导不一致，可能导致训练不稳定和奖励黑客行为，因此需要改进。

Method: 从RLHF最优条件直接推导出新损失函数，针对对数差设定有限目标值，避免无限最大化。

Result: 新方法在Qwen2.5-7B模型上显著优于标准DPO基线，性能接近更大的Llama-3.1-8B模型。

Conclusion: 提出的损失函数更稳定且有效，避免了DPO的问题，提升了模型对齐性能。

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is
commonly achieved through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) simplified this paradigm by establishing a
direct mapping between the optimal policy and a reward function, eliminating
the need for an explicit reward model. However, we argue that the DPO loss
function is theoretically misaligned with its own derivation, as it promotes
the indefinite maximization of a logits difference, which can lead to training
instability and reward hacking. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function
derived directly from the RLHF optimality condition. Our proposed loss targets
a specific, finite value for the logits difference, which is dictated by the
underlying reward, rather than its maximization. We provide a theoretical
analysis, including a gradient-based comparison, to demonstrate that our method
avoids the large gradients that plague DPO when the probability of dispreferred
responses approaches zero. This inherent stability prevents reward hacking and
leads to more effective alignment. We validate our approach by fine-tuning a
Qwen2.5-7B model, showing significant win-rate improvements over a standard DPO
baseline and achieving competitive performance against larger models like
Llama-3.1-8B.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中隐私保护（通过局部差分隐私）与模型准确性之间的权衡问题。

Method: 引入代币激励机制，客户端根据梯度扰动程度获得代币，用于访问更新后的全局模型。

Result: 通过博弈论分析，实验验证了不同参数对隐私与准确性权衡的影响。

Conclusion: 代币机制有效激励客户端减少噪声添加，提升模型准确性，同时保护隐私。

Abstract: In Federated Learning (FL), multiple clients jointly train a machine learning
model by sharing gradient information, instead of raw data, with a server over
multiple rounds. To address the possibility of information leakage in spite of
sharing only the gradients, Local Differential Privacy (LDP) is often used. In
LDP, clients add a selective amount of noise to the gradients before sending
the same to the server. Although such noise addition protects the privacy of
clients, it leads to a degradation in global model accuracy. In this paper, we
model this privacy-accuracy trade-off as a game, where the sever incentivizes
the clients to add a lower degree of noise for achieving higher accuracy, while
the clients attempt to preserve their privacy at the cost of a potential loss
in accuracy. A token based incentivization mechanism is introduced in which the
quantum of tokens credited to a client in an FL round is a function of the
degree of perturbation of its gradients. The client can later access a newly
updated global model only after acquiring enough tokens, which are to be
deducted from its balance. We identify the players, their actions and payoff,
and perform a strategic analysis of the game. Extensive experiments were
carried out to study the impact of different parameters.

Motivation: 探索Transformer模型深度与马尔可夫阶数对上下文学习（ICL）能力的影响，尤其是两层单头Transformer是否能表示高阶马尔可夫过程。

Method: 理论证明了两层单头Transformer可以表示任何k阶条件n-gram模型，并分析了其学习动态。

Result: 证明了两层单头Transformer能够高效表示高阶马尔可夫过程，且通过简化的一阶马尔可夫链展示了训练中上下文表征的形成。

Conclusion: 研究深化了对Transformer ICL能力的理解，表明浅层架构在结构化序列建模任务中也能表现出强大的ICL能力。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a hallmark capability of transformers, through
which trained models learn to adapt to new tasks by leveraging information from
the input context. Prior work has shown that ICL emerges in transformers due to
the presence of special circuits called induction heads. Given the equivalence
between induction heads and conditional k-grams, a recent line of work modeling
sequential inputs as Markov processes has revealed the fundamental impact of
model depth on its ICL capabilities: while a two-layer transformer can
efficiently represent a conditional 1-gram model, its single-layer counterpart
cannot solve the task unless it is exponentially large. However, for higher
order Markov sources, the best known constructions require at least three
layers (each with a single attention head) - leaving open the question: can a
two-layer single-head transformer represent any kth-order Markov process? In
this paper, we precisely address this and theoretically show that a two-layer
transformer with one head per layer can indeed represent any conditional
k-gram. Thus, our result provides the tightest known characterization of the
interplay between transformer depth and Markov order for ICL. Building on this,
we further analyze the learning dynamics of our two-layer construction,
focusing on a simplified variant for first-order Markov chains, illustrating
how effective in-context representations emerge during training. Together,
these results deepen our current understanding of transformer-based ICL and
illustrate how even shallow architectures can surprisingly exhibit strong ICL
capabilities on structured sequence modeling tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Neural Bridge Processes (NBPs)的新方法，用于建模随机函数，通过动态锚定输入x的扩散轨迹，解决了传统模型在可扩展性和多模态分布捕捉上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型如高斯过程（GPs）在大数据集上存在可扩展性问题，且假设高斯性限制了适用性；神经过程（NPs）虽灵活但难以捕捉复杂多模态分布；神经扩散过程（NDPs）通过扩散过程增强表达性，但存在输入耦合弱和语义不匹配问题。

Method: 提出Neural Bridge Processes (NBPs)，通过将前向核显式依赖于输入x，强制约束路径严格终止于监督目标，从而增强梯度信号并保证终点一致性。

Result: 在合成数据、EEG信号回归和图像回归任务上验证了NBPs的有效性，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: NBPs通过DDPM风格的桥采样，在性能和理论一致性上均表现出色，适用于结构化预测任务。

Abstract: Learning stochastic functions from partially observed context-target pairs is
a fundamental problem in probabilistic modeling. Traditional models like
Gaussian Processes (GPs) face scalability issues with large datasets and assume
Gaussianity, limiting their applicability. While Neural Processes (NPs) offer
more flexibility, they struggle with capturing complex, multi-modal target
distributions. Neural Diffusion Processes (NDPs) enhance expressivity through a
learned diffusion process but rely solely on conditional signals in the
denoising network, resulting in weak input coupling from an unconditional
forward process and semantic mismatch at the diffusion endpoint. In this work,
we propose Neural Bridge Processes (NBPs), a novel method for modeling
stochastic functions where inputs x act as dynamic anchors for the entire
diffusion trajectory. By reformulating the forward kernel to explicitly depend
on x, NBP enforces a constrained path that strictly terminates at the
supervised target. This approach not only provides stronger gradient signals
but also guarantees endpoint coherence. We validate NBPs on synthetic data, EEG
signal regression and image regression tasks, achieving substantial
improvements over baselines. These results underscore the effectiveness of
DDPM-style bridge sampling in enhancing both performance and theoretical
consistency for structured prediction tasks.

Abstract: Estimating individualized treatment effects from observational data presents
a persistent challenge due to unmeasured confounding and structural bias.
Causal Machine Learning (causal ML) methods, such as causal trees and doubly
robust estimators, provide tools for estimating conditional average treatment
effects. These methods have limited effectiveness in complex real-world
environments due to the presence of latent confounders or those described in
unstructured formats. Moreover, reliance on domain experts for confounder
identification and rule interpretation introduces high annotation cost and
scalability concerns. In this work, we proposed Large Language Model-based
agents for automated confounder discovery and subgroup analysis that integrate
agents into the causal ML pipeline to simulate domain expertise. Our framework
systematically performs subgroup identification and confounding structure
discovery by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LLM-based agents, which
reduces human dependency while preserving interpretability. Experiments on
real-world medical datasets show that our proposed approach enhances treatment
effect estimation robustness by narrowing confidence intervals and uncovering
unrecognized confounding biases. Our findings suggest that LLM-based agents
offer a promising path toward scalable, trustworthy, and semantically aware
causal inference.

Abstract: We present EDGE, a general-purpose, misconception-aware adaptive learning
framework composed of four stages: Evaluate (ability and state estimation),
Diagnose (posterior infer-ence of misconceptions), Generate (counterfactual
item synthesis), and Exercise (index-based retrieval scheduling). EDGE unifies
psychometrics (IRT/Bayesian state space models), cog-nitive diagnostics
(misconception discovery from distractor patterns and response latencies),
contrastive item generation (minimal perturbations that invalidate learner
shortcuts while pre-serving psychometric validity), and principled scheduling
(a restless bandit approximation to spaced retrieval). We formalize a composite
readiness metric, EdgeScore, prove its monotonicity and Lipschitz continuity,
and derive an index policy that is near-optimal under mild assumptions on
forgetting and learning gains. We further establish conditions under which
counterfactual items provably reduce the posterior probability of a targeted
misconception faster than standard practice. The paper focuses on theory and
implementable pseudocode; empirical study is left to future work.

Conclusion: CNSDiff通过避免候选池偏差和显式减轻混杂因素影响，显著提升了推荐系统的泛化能力。

Abstract: Heuristic negative sampling enhances recommendation performance by selecting
negative samples of varying hardness levels from predefined candidate pools to
guide the model toward learning more accurate decision boundaries. However, our
empirical and theoretical analyses reveal that unobserved environmental
confounders (e.g., exposure or popularity biases) in candidate pools may cause
heuristic sampling methods to introduce false hard negatives (FHNS). These
misleading samples can encourage the model to learn spurious correlations
induced by such confounders, ultimately compromising its generalization ability
under distribution shifts. To address this issue, we propose a novel method
named Causal Negative Sampling via Diffusion (CNSDiff). By synthesizing
negative samples in the latent space via a conditional diffusion process,
CNSDiff avoids the bias introduced by predefined candidate pools and thus
reduces the likelihood of generating FHNS. Moreover, it incorporates a causal
regularization term to explicitly mitigate the influence of environmental
confounders during the negative sampling process, leading to robust negatives
that promote out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Comprehensive
experiments under four representative distribution shift scenarios demonstrate
that CNSDiff achieves an average improvement of 13.96% across all evaluation
metrics compared to state-of-the-art baselines, verifying its effectiveness and
robustness in OOD recommendation tasks.

Conclusion: 本文首次实现了风险敏感目标的二阶收敛性，填补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: We consider the problem of risk-sensitive control in a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework. In particular, we aim to find a risk-optimal policy by
maximizing the distortion riskmetric (DRM) of the discounted reward in a finite
horizon Markov decision process (MDP). DRMs are a rich class of risk measures
that include several well-known risk measures as special cases. We derive a
policy Hessian theorem for the DRM objective using the likelihood ratio method.
Using this result, we propose a natural DRM Hessian estimator from sample
trajectories of the underlying MDP. Next, we present a cubic-regularized policy
Newton algorithm for solving this problem in an on-policy RL setting using
estimates of the DRM gradient and Hessian. Our proposed algorithm is shown to
converge to an $\epsilon$-second-order stationary point ($\epsilon$-SOSP) of
the DRM objective, and this guarantee ensures the escaping of saddle points.
The sample complexity of our algorithms to find an $ \epsilon$-SOSP is
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3.5})$. Our experiments validate the theoretical
findings. To the best of our knowledge, our is the first work to present
convergence to an $\epsilon$-SOSP of a risk-sensitive objective, while existing
works in the literature have either shown convergence to a first-order
stationary point of a risk-sensitive objective, or a SOSP of a risk-neutral
one.

Abstract: Reliable seizure detection is critical for diagnosing and managing epilepsy,
yet clinical workflows remain dependent on time-consuming manual EEG
interpretation. While machine learning has shown promise, existing approaches
often rely on dataset-specific optimisations, limiting their real-world
applicability and reproducibility. Here, we introduce an innovative,
open-source machine-learning framework that enables robust and generalisable
seizure detection across varied clinical datasets. We evaluate our approach on
two publicly available EEG datasets that differ in patient populations and
electrode configurations. To enhance robustness, the framework incorporates an
automated pre-processing pipeline to standardise data and a majority voting
mechanism, in which multiple models independently assess each second of EEG
before reaching a final decision. We train, tune, and evaluate models within
each dataset, assessing their cross-dataset transferability. Our models achieve
high within-dataset performance (AUC 0.904+/-0.059 for CHB-MIT and
0.864+/-0.060 for TUSZ) and demonstrate strong generalisation across datasets
despite differences in EEG setups and populations (AUC 0.615+/-0.039 for models
trained on CHB-MIT and tested on TUSZ and 0.762+/-0.175 in the reverse case)
without any post-processing. Furthermore, a mild post-processing improved the
within-dataset results to 0.913+/-0.064 and 0.867+/-0.058 and cross-dataset
results to 0.619+/-0.036 and 0.768+/-0.172. These results underscore the
potential of, and essential considerations for, deploying our framework in
diverse clinical settings. By making our methodology fully reproducible, we
provide a foundation for advancing clinically viable, dataset-agnostic seizure
detection systems. This approach has the potential for widespread adoption,
complementing rather than replacing expert interpretation, and accelerating
clinical integration.

Abstract: The goal of data attribution is to trace the model's predictions through the
learning algorithm and back to its training data. thereby identifying the most
influential training samples and understanding how the model's behavior leads
to particular predictions. Understanding how individual training examples
influence a model's predictions is fundamental for machine learning
interpretability, data debugging, and model accountability. Influence
functions, originating from robust statistics, offer an efficient, first-order
approximation to estimate the impact of marginally upweighting or removing a
data point on a model's learned parameters and its subsequent predictions,
without the need for expensive retraining. This paper comprehensively reviews
the data attribution capability of influence functions in deep learning. We
discuss their theoretical foundations, recent algorithmic advances for
efficient inverse-Hessian-vector product estimation, and evaluate their
effectiveness for data attribution and mislabel detection. Finally,
highlighting current challenges and promising directions for unleashing the
huge potential of influence functions in large-scale, real-world deep learning

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic (Nesy) learning improves the target task performance of models
by enabling them to satisfy knowledge, while semi/self-supervised learning
(SSL) improves the target task performance by designing unsupervised pretext
tasks for unlabeled data to make models satisfy corresponding assumptions. We
extend the Nesy theory based on reliable knowledge to the scenario of
unreliable knowledge (i.e., assumptions), thereby unifying the theoretical
frameworks of SSL and Nesy. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we
demonstrate that, in theory, the impact of pretext tasks on target performance
hinges on three factors: knowledge learnability with respect to the model,
knowledge reliability with respect to the data, and knowledge completeness with
respect to the target. We further propose schemes to operationalize these
theoretical metrics, and thereby develop a method that can predict the
effectiveness of pretext tasks in advance. This will change the current status
quo in practical applications, where the selections of unsupervised tasks are
heuristic-based rather than theory-based, and it is difficult to evaluate the
rationality of unsupervised pretext task selection before testing the model on
the target task. In experiments, we verify a high correlation between the
predicted performance-estimated using minimal data-and the actual performance
achieved after large-scale semi-supervised or self-supervised learning, thus
confirming the validity of the theory and the effectiveness of the evaluation
method.

Abstract: With the breakthrough progress of large language models (LLMs) in natural
language processing and multimodal tasks, efficiently deploying them on
resource-constrained edge devices has become a critical challenge. The Mixture
of Experts (MoE) architecture enhances model capacity through sparse
activation, but faces two major difficulties in practical deployment: (1) The
presence of numerous outliers in activation distributions leads to severe
degradation in quantization accuracy for both activations and weights,
significantly impairing inference performance; (2) Under limited memory,
efficient offloading and collaborative inference of expert modules struggle to
balance latency and throughput. To address these issues, this paper proposes an
efficient MoE edge deployment scheme based on Hessian-Aware Quantization (HAQ)
and CPU-GPU collaborative inference. First, by introducing smoothed Hessian
matrix quantization, we achieve joint 8-bit quantization of activations and
weights, which significantly alleviates the accuracy loss caused by outliers
while ensuring efficient implementation on mainstream hardware. Second, we
design an expert-level collaborative offloading and inference mechanism, which,
combined with expert activation path statistics, enables efficient deployment
and scheduling of expert modules between CPU and GPU, greatly reducing memory
footprint and inference latency. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our method on mainstream large models such as the OPT series
and Mixtral 8*7B: on datasets like Wikitext2 and C4, the inference accuracy of
the low-bit quantized model approaches that of the full-precision model, while
GPU memory usage is reduced by about 60%, and inference latency is
significantly improved.

Abstract: Stochastic interpolants offer a robust framework for continuously

promise for generative modeling. Despite their potential, rigorous finite-time
convergence guarantees for practical numerical schemes remain largely
unexplored. In this work, we address the finite-time convergence analysis of
numerical implementations for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) derived
from stochastic interpolants. Specifically, we establish novel finite-time
error bounds in total variation distance for two widely used numerical
integrators: the first-order forward Euler method and the second-order Heun's
method. Furthermore, our analysis on the iteration complexity of specific
stochastic interpolant constructions provides optimized schedules to enhance
computational efficiency. Our theoretical findings are corroborated by
numerical experiments, which validate the derived error bounds and complexity
analyses.

essential for genomic studies due to their crucial role as structural elements
in bacteriophages. Computational tools, particularly machine learning, have
emerged for annotating phage protein sequences from high-throughput sequencing.
However, effective annotation requires specialized sequence encodings. Our
paper introduces ProteoKnight, a new image-based encoding method that addresses
spatial constraints in existing techniques, yielding competitive performance in
PVP classification using pre-trained convolutional neural networks.
Additionally, our study evaluates prediction uncertainty in binary PVP
classification through Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD). \textbf{Methods:}
ProteoKnight adapts the classical DNA-Walk algorithm for protein sequences,
incorporating pixel colors and adjusting walk distances to capture intricate
protein features. Encoded sequences were classified using multiple pre-trained
CNNs. Variance and entropy measures assessed prediction uncertainty across
proteins of various classes and lengths. \textbf{Results:} Our experiments
achieved 90.8% accuracy in binary classification, comparable to
state-of-the-art methods. Multi-class classification accuracy remains
suboptimal. Our uncertainty analysis unveils variability in prediction
confidence influenced by protein class and sequence length.
\textbf{Conclusions:} Our study surpasses frequency chaos game representation
(FCGR) by introducing novel image encoding that mitigates spatial information
loss limitations. Our classification technique yields accurate and robust PVP
predictions while identifying low-confidence predictions.

Result: 证明了ReLU网络和线性网络在特定初始化条件下可实现维度缩减，并推广了平衡初始化的概念。

Conclusion: 论文为理解梯度流的低维结构提供了理论框架，并展示了其在深度学习中的实际应用。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in the theory of deep learning is to understand
whether gradient-based training in high-dimensional parameter spaces can be
captured by simpler, lower-dimensional structures, leading to so-called
implicit bias. As a stepping stone, we study when a gradient flow on a
high-dimensional variable $\theta$ implies an intrinsic gradient flow on a
lower-dimensional variable $z = \phi(\theta)$, for an architecture-related
function $\phi$. We express a so-called intrinsic dynamic property and show how
it is related to the study of conservation laws associated with the
factorization $\phi$. This leads to a simple criterion based on the inclusion
of kernels of linear maps which yields a necessary condition for this property
to hold. We then apply our theory to general ReLU networks of arbitrary depth
and show that, for any initialization, it is possible to rewrite the flow as an
intrinsic dynamic in a lower dimension that depends only on $z$ and the
initialization, when $\phi$ is the so-called path-lifting. In the case of
linear networks with $\phi$ the product of weight matrices, so-called balanced
initializations are also known to enable such a dimensionality reduction; we
generalize this result to a broader class of {\em relaxed balanced}
initializations, showing that, in certain configurations, these are the
\emph{only} initializations that ensure the intrinsic dynamic property.
Finally, for the linear neural ODE associated with the limit of infinitely deep
linear networks, with relaxed balanced initialization, we explicitly express
the corresponding intrinsic dynamics.

Abstract: Modern methods of generative modelling and unpaired image-to-image
translation based on Schr\"odinger bridges and stochastic optimal control
theory aim to transform an initial density to a target one in an optimal way.
In the present paper, we assume that we only have access to i.i.d. samples from
initial and final distributions. This makes our setup suitable for both
generative modelling and unpaired image-to-image translation. Relying on the
stochastic optimal control approach, we choose an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process as
the reference one and estimate the corresponding Schr\"odinger potential.
Introducing a risk function as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between
couplings, we derive tight bounds on generalization ability of an empirical
risk minimizer in a class of Schr\"odinger potentials including Gaussian
mixtures. Thanks to the mixing properties of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, we
almost achieve fast rates of convergence up to some logarithmic factors in
favourable scenarios. We also illustrate performance of the suggested approach
with numerical experiments.

Motivation: 现有LRNN模型因时间不变转移矩阵或受限特征值范围而缺乏状态跟踪能力，需探索改进方法。

Method: 研究多层SSM中结合输入独立和非负SSM的可能性，并分析其对简单任务（如奇偶校验）的影响。

Result: 实验表明，即使结合这两种SSM，仍无法解决奇偶校验任务，需输入依赖和负特征值。

Conclusion: 状态跟踪任务需要输入依赖的转移矩阵和负特征值，现有模型需进一步改进。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that LRNN models such as S4D, Mamba, and DeltaNet lack
state-tracking capability due to either time-invariant transition matrices or
restricted eigenvalue ranges. To address this, input-dependent transition
matrices, particularly those that are complex or non-triangular, have been
proposed to enhance SSM performance on such tasks. While existing theorems
demonstrate that both input-independent and non-negative SSMs are incapable of
solving simple state-tracking tasks, such as parity, regardless of depth, they
do not explore whether combining these two types in a multilayer SSM could
help. We investigate this question for efficient SSMs with diagonal transition
matrices and show that such combinations still fail to solve parity. This
implies that a recurrence layer must both be input-dependent and include
negative eigenvalues. Our experiments support this conclusion by analyzing an
SSM model that combines S4D and Mamba layers.

TL;DR: 论文研究了从最优策略或最大熵强化学习演示中恢复时变奖励函数的问题，提出了两种奖励先验假设，并分别转化为稀疏化和秩最小化问题，设计了高效算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励函数恢复问题在缺乏额外假设时高度不适定，但在实际应用中奖励通常具有稀疏性或可表示为少量特征的线性组合，因此研究如何利用这些先验信息高效恢复奖励函数具有重要意义。

Method: 1）假设奖励大多为常数且变化稀疏，将其转化为带线性约束的稀疏化问题，并给出多项式时间精确算法；2）假设奖励可表示为少量特征的线性组合，转化为带线性约束的秩最小化问题，利用凸松弛求解。

Result: 提出的算法能高效恢复奖励函数，并通过多个示例验证了恢复奖励的准确性和泛化性。

Conclusion: 通过合理利用奖励的稀疏性或低秩特性，可以高效解决奖励函数恢复问题，为实际应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of recovering time-varying reward
functions from either optimal policies or demonstrations coming from a max
entropy reinforcement learning problem. This problem is highly ill-posed
without additional assumptions on the underlying rewards. However, in many
applications, the rewards are indeed parsimonious, and some prior information
is available. We consider two such priors on the rewards: 1) rewards are mostly
constant and they change infrequently, 2) rewards can be represented by a
linear combination of a small number of feature functions. We first show that
the reward identification problem with the former prior can be recast as a
sparsification problem subject to linear constraints. Moreover, we give a
polynomial-time algorithm that solves this sparsification problem exactly.
Then, we show that identifying rewards representable with the minimum number of
features can be recast as a rank minimization problem subject to linear
constraints, for which convex relaxations of rank can be invoked. In both
cases, these observations lead to efficient optimization-based reward
identification algorithms. Several examples are given to demonstrate the
accuracy of the recovered rewards as well as their generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 闪电对人身安全和经济发展构成重大威胁，现有预测模型存在动态空间上下文捕捉不足、数据利用不充分等问题，亟需改进。

Method: DeepLight利用雷达反射率、云属性和历史闪电数据，通过双编码器和多分支卷积技术动态捕捉空间相关性，并引入Hazy Loss函数处理时空不确定性。

Result: 实验表明，DeepLight在公平威胁评分（ETS）上比现有方法提升18%-30%。

Conclusion: DeepLight为闪电预测提供了更鲁棒的解决方案，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Lightning, a common feature of severe meteorological conditions, poses
significant risks, from direct human injuries to substantial economic losses.
These risks are further exacerbated by climate change. Early and accurate
prediction of lightning would enable preventive measures to safeguard people,
protect property, and minimize economic losses. In this paper, we present
DeepLight, a novel deep learning architecture for predicting lightning
occurrences. Existing prediction models face several critical limitations: they
often struggle to capture the dynamic spatial context and inherent uncertainty
of lightning events, underutilize key observational data, such as radar
reflectivity and cloud properties, and rely heavily on Numerical Weather
Prediction (NWP) systems, which are both computationally expensive and highly
sensitive to parameter settings. To overcome these challenges, DeepLight
leverages multi-source meteorological data, including radar reflectivity, cloud
properties, and historical lightning occurrences through a dual-encoder
architecture. By employing multi-branch convolution techniques, it dynamically
captures spatial correlations across varying extents. Furthermore, its novel
Hazy Loss function explicitly addresses the spatio-temporal uncertainty of
lightning by penalizing deviations based on proximity to true events, enabling
the model to better learn patterns amidst randomness. Extensive experiments
show that DeepLight improves the Equitable Threat Score (ETS) by 18%-30% over
state-of-the-art methods, establishing it as a robust solution for lightning
prediction.

Motivation: 现有算子学习方法依赖高保真模拟数据，计算成本高，DOOL旨在通过无监督学习降低这一成本。

Method: 基于Onsager变分原理，通过最小化Rayleighian函数训练深度算子网络，无需标记数据，并采用时空解耦策略提升效率。

Result: 数值实验验证了DOOL的有效性，与监督学习方法相比性能更优。

Conclusion: DOOL为耗散方程提供了一种高效的无监督学习框架，并可扩展至不直接遵循OVP的二阶波模型。

Abstract: Existing operator learning methods rely on supervised training with
high-fidelity simulation data, introducing significant computational cost. In
this work, we propose the deep Onsager operator learning (DOOL) method, a novel
unsupervised framework for solving dissipative equations. Rooted in the Onsager
variational principle (OVP), DOOL trains a deep operator network by directly
minimizing the OVP-defined Rayleighian functional, requiring no labeled data,
and then proceeds in time explicitly through conservation/change laws for the
solution. Another key innovation here lies in the spatiotemporal decoupling
strategy: the operator's trunk network processes spatial coordinates
exclusively, thereby enhancing training efficiency, while integrated external
time stepping enables temporal extrapolation. Numerical experiments on typical
dissipative equations validate the effectiveness of the DOOL method, and
systematic comparisons with supervised DeepONet and MIONet demonstrate its
enhanced performance. Extensions are made to cover the second-order wave models
with dissipation that do not directly follow OVP.

Motivation: 解决稀疏奖励信号下学习有效特征的挑战，避免复杂辅助目标或完全解耦带来的设计复杂性。

Method: 提出SCORER框架，将感知与控制网络的交互建模为Stackelberg博弈，并开发两时间尺度算法近似均衡。

Result: 在标准DQN变体上验证，SCORER提高了样本效率和最终性能。

Conclusion: 通过结构化感知与控制动态的算法设计，无需复杂辅助目标或架构即可实现性能提升。

Abstract: Integrated, end-to-end learning of representations and policies remains a
cornerstone of deep reinforcement learning (RL). However, to address the
challenge of learning effective features from a sparse reward signal, recent
trends have shifted towards adding complex auxiliary objectives or fully
decoupling the two processes, often at the cost of increased design complexity.
This work proposes an alternative to both decoupling and naive end-to-end
learning, arguing that performance can be significantly improved by structuring
the interaction between distinct perception and control networks with a
principled, game-theoretic dynamic. We formalize this dynamic by introducing
the Stackelberg Coupled Representation and Reinforcement Learning (SCORER)
framework, which models the interaction between perception and control as a
Stackelberg game. The perception network (leader) strategically learns features
to benefit the control network (follower), whose own objective is to minimize
its Bellman error. We approximate the game's equilibrium with a practical
two-timescale algorithm. Applied to standard DQN variants on benchmark tasks,
SCORER improves sample efficiency and final performance. Our results show that
performance gains can be achieved through principled algorithmic design of the
perception-control dynamic, without requiring complex auxiliary objectives or
architectures.

Conclusion: 首次揭示了预测不确定性在恶意遗忘攻击中的脆弱性，并提出了有效的攻击方法。

Abstract: Currently, various uncertainty quantification methods have been proposed to
provide certainty and probability estimates for deep learning models' label
predictions. Meanwhile, with the growing demand for the right to be forgotten,
machine unlearning has been extensively studied as a means to remove the impact
of requested sensitive data from a pre-trained model without retraining the
model from scratch. However, the vulnerabilities of such generated predictive
uncertainties with regard to dedicated malicious unlearning attacks remain
unexplored. To bridge this gap, for the first time, we propose a new class of
malicious unlearning attacks against predictive uncertainties, where the
adversary aims to cause the desired manipulations of specific predictive
uncertainty results. We also design novel optimization frameworks for our
attacks and conduct extensive experiments, including black-box scenarios.
Notably, our extensive experiments show that our attacks are more effective in
manipulating predictive uncertainties than traditional attacks that focus on
label misclassifications, and existing defenses against conventional attacks
are ineffective against our attacks.

Abstract: Integrating multi-omics data, such as DNA methylation, mRNA expression, and
microRNA (miRNA) expression, offers a comprehensive view of the biological
mechanisms underlying disease. However, the high dimensionality and complex
interactions among omics layers present major challenges for predictive
modeling. We propose Multi-Omics integration with Tree-generated Graph Neural
Network (MOTGNN), a novel and interpretable framework for binary disease
classification. MOTGNN employs eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to perform
omics-specific supervised graph construction, followed by modality-specific
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for hierarchical representation learning, and a
deep feedforward network for cross-omics integration. On three real-world
disease datasets, MOTGNN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 5-10% in
accuracy, ROC-AUC, and F1-score, and remains robust to severe class imbalance
(e.g., 87.2% vs. 33.4% F1 on imbalanced data). The model maintains
computational efficiency through sparse graphs (2.1-2.8 edges per node) and
provides built-in interpretability, revealing both top-ranked biomarkers and
the relative contributions of each omics modality. These results highlight
MOTGNN's potential to improve both predictive accuracy and interpretability in
multi-omics disease modeling.

Conclusion: 重尾梯度下的OCO问题可通过经典算法有效解决，无需额外操作，且结果具有广泛的应用价值。

Abstract: In Online Convex Optimization (OCO), when the stochastic gradient has a
finite variance, many algorithms provably work and guarantee a sublinear
regret. However, limited results are known if the gradient estimate has a heavy
tail, i.e., the stochastic gradient only admits a finite $\mathsf{p}$-th
central moment for some $\mathsf{p}\in\left(1,2\right]$. Motivated by it, this
work examines different old algorithms for OCO (e.g., Online Gradient Descent)
in the more challenging heavy-tailed setting. Under the standard bounded domain
assumption, we establish new regrets for these classical methods without any
algorithmic modification. Remarkably, these regret bounds are fully optimal in
all parameters (can be achieved even without knowing $\mathsf{p}$), suggesting
that OCO with heavy tails can be solved effectively without any extra operation
(e.g., gradient clipping). Our new results have several applications. A
particularly interesting one is the first provable convergence result for
nonsmooth nonconvex optimization under heavy-tailed noise without gradient
clipping. Furthermore, we explore broader settings (e.g., smooth OCO) and
extend our ideas to optimistic algorithms to handle different cases
simultaneously.

Abstract: Deep learning approaches are increasingly relevant for time series
forecasting tasks. Methods such as N-BEATS, which is built on stacks of
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) blocks, have achieved state-of-the-art results on
benchmark datasets and competitions. N-BEATS is also more interpretable
relative to other deep learning approaches, as it decomposes forecasts into
different time series components, such as trend and seasonality. In this work,
we present N-BEATS-MOE, an extension of N-BEATS based on a Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) layer. N-BEATS-MOE employs a dynamic block weighting strategy based on a
gating network which allows the model to better adapt to the characteristics of
each time series. We also hypothesize that the gating mechanism provides
additional interpretability by identifying which expert is most relevant for
each series. We evaluate our method across 12 benchmark datasets against
several approaches, achieving consistent improvements on several datasets,
especially those composed of heterogeneous time series.

Result: 理论证明和实验验证表明，DPMixSGD在保护隐私的同时保持了收敛性能。

Conclusion: DPMixSGD是一种有效的隐私保护算法，适用于非凸分散式极小极大优化问题。

Abstract: Decentralized min-max optimization allows multi-agent systems to
collaboratively solve global min-max optimization problems by facilitating the
exchange of model updates among neighboring agents, eliminating the need for a
central server. However, sharing model updates in such systems carry a risk of
exposing sensitive data to inference attacks, raising significant privacy
concerns. To mitigate these privacy risks, differential privacy (DP) has become
a widely adopted technique for safeguarding individual data. Despite its
advantages, implementing DP in decentralized min-max optimization poses
challenges, as the added noise can hinder convergence, particularly in
non-convex scenarios with complex agent interactions in min-max optimization
problems. In this work, we propose an algorithm called DPMixSGD (Differential
Private Minmax Hybrid Stochastic Gradient Descent), a novel privacy-preserving
algorithm specifically designed for non-convex decentralized min-max
optimization. Our method builds on the state-of-the-art STORM-based algorithm,
one of the fastest decentralized min-max solutions. We rigorously prove that
the noise added to local gradients does not significantly compromise
convergence performance, and we provide theoretical bounds to ensure privacy
guarantees. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct extensive
experiments across various tasks and models, demonstrating the effectiveness of
our approach.

Abstract: As deep spatio-temporal neural networks are increasingly utilised in urban
computing contexts, the deployment of such methods can have a direct impact on
users of critical urban infrastructure, such as public transport, emergency
services, and traffic management systems. While many spatio-temporal methods
focus on improving accuracy, fairness has recently gained attention due to
growing evidence that biased predictions in spatio-temporal applications can
disproportionately disadvantage certain demographic or geographic groups,
thereby reinforcing existing socioeconomic inequalities and undermining the
ethical deployment of AI in public services. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework, FairDRL-ST, based on disentangled representation learning, to
address fairness concerns in spatio-temporal prediction, with a particular
focus on mobility demand forecasting. By leveraging adversarial learning and
disentangled representation learning, our framework learns to separate
attributes that contain sensitive information. Unlike existing methods that
enforce fairness through supervised learning, which may lead to
overcompensation and degraded performance, our framework achieves fairness in
an unsupervised manner with minimal performance loss. We apply our framework to
real-world urban mobility datasets and demonstrate its ability to close
fairness gaps while delivering competitive predictive performance compared to
state-of-the-art fairness-aware methods.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable bearing fault classification is critical for
ensuring the reliability of rotating machinery, particularly under variable
operating conditions where domain shifts can significantly degrade model
performance. This study proposes a physics-informed multimodal convolutional
neural network (CNN) with a late fusion architecture, integrating vibration and
motor current signals alongside a dedicated physics-based feature extraction
branch. The model incorporates a novel physics-informed loss function that
penalizes physically implausible predictions based on characteristic bearing
fault frequencies - Ball Pass Frequency Outer (BPFO) and Ball Pass Frequency
Inner (BPFI) - derived from bearing geometry and shaft speed. Comprehensive
experiments on the Paderborn University dataset demonstrate that the proposed
physics-informed approach consistently outperforms a non-physics-informed
baseline, achieving higher accuracy, reduced false classifications, and
improved robustness across multiple data splits. To address performance
degradation under unseen operating conditions, three transfer learning (TL)
strategies - Target-Specific Fine-Tuning (TSFT), Layer-Wise Adaptation Strategy
(LAS), and Hybrid Feature Reuse (HFR) - are evaluated. Results show that LAS
yields the best generalization, with additional performance gains when combined
with physics-informed modeling. Validation on the KAIST bearing dataset
confirms the framework's cross-dataset applicability, achieving up to 98
percent accuracy. Statistical hypothesis testing further verifies significant
improvements (p < 0.01) in classification performance. The proposed framework
demonstrates the potential of integrating domain knowledge with data-driven
learning to achieve robust, interpretable, and generalizable fault diagnosis
for real-world industrial applications.

Conclusion: 通过优化面向任务的AoI函数，可以有效提升远程推理的准确性。

Abstract: We consider a remote inference system with multiple modalities, where a
multimodal machine learning (ML) model performs real-time inference using
features collected from remote sensors. As sensor observations may change
dynamically over time, fresh features are critical for inference tasks.
However, timely delivering features from all modalities is often infeasible due
to limited network resources. To this end, we study a two-modality scheduling
problem to minimize the ML model's inference error, which is expressed as a
penalty function of AoI for both modalities. We develop an index-based
threshold policy and prove its optimality. Specifically, the scheduler switches
modalities when the current modality's index function exceeds a threshold. We
show that the two modalities share the same threshold, and both the index
functions and the threshold can be computed efficiently. The optimality of our
policy holds for (i) general AoI functions that are \emph{non-monotonic} and
\emph{non-additive} and (ii) \emph{heterogeneous} transmission times. Numerical
results show that our policy reduces inference error by up to 55% compared to
round-robin and uniform random policies, which are oblivious to the AoI-based
inference error function. Our results shed light on how to improve remote
inference accuracy by optimizing task-oriented AoI functions.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes
domains where reliability is paramount. This thesis investigates how
uncertainty estimation can enhance the safety and trustworthiness of ML,
focusing on selective prediction -- where models abstain when confidence is
low.
  We first show that a model's training trajectory contains rich uncertainty
signals that can be exploited without altering its architecture or loss. By
ensembling predictions from intermediate checkpoints, we propose a lightweight,
post-hoc abstention method that works across tasks, avoids the cost of deep
ensembles, and achieves state-of-the-art selective prediction performance.
Crucially, this approach is fully compatible with differential privacy (DP),
allowing us to study how privacy noise affects uncertainty quality. We find
that while many methods degrade under DP, our trajectory-based approach remains
robust, and we introduce a framework for isolating the privacy-uncertainty
trade-off. Next, we then develop a finite-sample decomposition of the selective
classification gap -- the deviation from the oracle accuracy-coverage curve --
identifying five interpretable error sources and clarifying which interventions
can close the gap. This explains why calibration alone cannot fix ranking
errors, motivating methods that improve uncertainty ordering. Finally, we show
that uncertainty signals can be adversarially manipulated to hide errors or
deny service while maintaining high accuracy, and we design defenses combining
calibration audits with verifiable inference.
  Together, these contributions advance reliable ML by improving, evaluating,
and safeguarding uncertainty estimation, enabling models that not only make
accurate predictions -- but also know when to say "I do not know".

Abstract: Using more test-time computation during language model inference, such as

takes an initial step toward bridging the gap between practical language model

noise injection and binary coefficient sampling. Through this framework, we
provide detailed analyses of widely adopted inference techniques. Supported by
empirical results, our theoretical framework and analysis demonstrate the

Abstract: A curious phenomenon observed in some dynamical generative models is the
following: despite learning errors in the score function or the drift vector
field, the generated samples appear to shift \emph{along} the support of the
data distribution but not \emph{away} from it. In this work, we investigate
this phenomenon of \emph{robustness of the support} by taking a dynamical
systems approach on the generating stochastic/deterministic process. Our
perturbation analysis of the probability flow reveals that infinitesimal
learning errors cause the predicted density to be different from the target
density only on the data manifold for a wide class of generative models.
Further, what is the dynamical mechanism that leads to the robustness of the
support? We show that the alignment of the top Lyapunov vectors (most sensitive
infinitesimal perturbation directions) with the tangent spaces along the
boundary of the data manifold leads to robustness and prove a sufficient
condition on the dynamics of the generating process to achieve this alignment.
Moreover, the alignment condition is efficient to compute and, in practice, for
robust generative models, automatically leads to accurate estimates of the
tangent bundle of the data manifold. Using a finite-time linear perturbation
analysis on samples paths as well as probability flows, our work complements
and extends existing works on obtaining theoretical guarantees for generative
models from a stochastic analysis, statistical learning and uncertainty
quantification points of view. Our results apply across different dynamical
generative models, such as conditional flow-matching and score-based generative
models, and for different target distributions that may or may not satisfy the
manifold hypothesis.

Motivation: 当前社区中高性能推理模型的复现问题较多，主要由于训练细节披露不完整。本文旨在提供完整的推理模型分析和工作流程。

Method: 从数据准备、长链思维监督微调（long CoT SFT）到强化学习（RL），并提出了Gradient-Preserving clipping Policy Optimization（GPPO）以解决现有裁剪机制的问题。

Result: Klear-Reasoner在数学和编程任务中表现优异，如AIME 2024（90.5%）、AIME 2025（83.2%）、LiveCodeBench V5（66.0%）和V6（58.1%）。

Conclusion: 高质量数据和小样本困难样本更有效，GPPO提升了模型的探索能力和学习效率。

Abstract: We present Klear-Reasoner, a model with long reasoning capabilities that
demonstrates careful deliberation during problem solving, achieving outstanding
performance across multiple benchmarks. Although there are already many
excellent works related to inference models in the current community, there are
still many problems with reproducing high-performance inference models due to
incomplete disclosure of training details. This report provides an in-depth
analysis of the reasoning model, covering the entire post-training workflow
from data preparation and long Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning (long
CoT SFT) to reinforcement learning (RL), along with detailed ablation studies
for each experimental component. For SFT data, our experiments show that a
small number of high-quality data sources are more effective than a large
number of diverse data sources, and that difficult samples can achieve better
results without accuracy filtering. In addition, we investigate two key issues
with current clipping mechanisms in RL: Clipping suppresses critical
exploration signals and ignores suboptimal trajectories. To address these
challenges, we propose Gradient-Preserving clipping Policy Optimization (GPPO)
that gently backpropagates gradients from clipped tokens. GPPO not only
enhances the model's exploration capacity but also improves its efficiency in
learning from negative samples. Klear-Reasoner exhibits exceptional reasoning
abilities in mathematics and programming, scoring 90.5\% on AIME 2024, 83.2\%
on AIME 2025, 66.0\% on LiveCodeBench V5 and 58.1\% on LiveCodeBench V6.

Conclusion: 首次在多项式时间内实现了近似后验采样的形式化结果，为实际应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We study the problem of posterior sampling in the context of score based
generative models. We have a trained score network for a prior $p(x)$, a
measurement model $p(y|x)$, and are tasked with sampling from the posterior
$p(x|y)$. Prior work has shown this to be intractable in KL (in the worst case)
under well-accepted computational hardness assumptions. Despite this, popular
algorithms for tasks such as image super-resolution, stylization, and
reconstruction enjoy empirical success. Rather than establishing distributional
assumptions or restricted settings under which exact posterior sampling is
tractable, we view this as a more general "tilting" problem of biasing a
distribution towards a measurement. Under minimal assumptions, we show that one
can tractably sample from a distribution that is simultaneously close to the
posterior of a noised prior in KL divergence and the true posterior in Fisher
divergence. Intuitively, this combination ensures that the resulting sample is
consistent with both the measurement and the prior. To the best of our
knowledge these are the first formal results for (approximate) posterior
sampling in polynomial time.

Abstract: Attribution explanation is a typical approach for explaining deep neural
networks (DNNs), inferring an importance or contribution score for each input
variable to the final output. In recent years, numerous attribution methods
have been developed to explain DNNs. However, a persistent concern remains
unresolved, i.e., whether and which attribution methods faithfully reflect the
actual contribution of input variables to the decision-making process. The
faithfulness issue undermines the reliability and practical utility of
attribution explanations. We argue that these concerns stem from three core
challenges. First, difficulties arise in comparing attribution methods due to
their unstructured heterogeneity, differences in heuristics, formulations, and
implementations that lack a unified organization. Second, most methods lack
solid theoretical underpinnings, with their rationales remaining absent,
ambiguous, or unverified. Third, empirically evaluating faithfulness is
challenging without ground truth. Recent theoretical advances provide a
promising way to tackle these challenges, attracting increasing attention. We
summarize these developments, with emphasis on three key directions: (i)
Theoretical unification, which uncovers commonalities and differences among
methods, enabling systematic comparisons; (ii) Theoretical rationale,
clarifying the foundations of existing methods; (iii) Theoretical evaluation,
rigorously proving whether methods satisfy faithfulness principles. Beyond a
comprehensive review, we provide insights into how these studies help deepen
theoretical understanding, inform method selection, and inspire new attribution
methods. We conclude with a discussion of promising open problems for further
work.

Abstract: Implicit continuous models, such as functional models and implicit neural
networks, are an increasingly popular method for replacing discrete data
representations with continuous, high-order, and differentiable surrogates.
These models offer new perspectives on the storage, transfer, and analysis of
scientific data. In this paper, we introduce the first framework to directly
extract complex topological features -- contours, Jacobi sets, and ridge-valley
graphs -- from a type of continuous implicit model known as multivariate
functional approximation (MFA). MFA replaces discrete data with continuous
piecewise smooth functions. Given an MFA model as the input, our approach
enables direct extraction of complex topological features from the model,
without reverting to a discrete representation of the model. Our work is easily
generalizable to any continuous implicit model that supports the queries of
function values and high-order derivatives. Our work establishes the building
blocks for performing topological data analysis and visualization on implicit
continuous models.

Result: 在UltraFeedback数据集上，方法相对标准方法提升10%以上，同时提高训练效率。

Conclusion: DMPO方法通过数据选择策略，有效利用细粒度偏好信号，实现更鲁棒的LLM对齐。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse human values requires
moving beyond a single holistic "better-than" preference criterion. While
collecting fine-grained, aspect-specific preference data is more reliable and
scalable, existing methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) struggle
with the severe noise and conflicts inherent in such aggregated datasets. In
this paper, we tackle this challenge from a data-centric perspective. We first
derive the Direct Multi-Preference Optimization (DMPO) objective, and uncover a
key Preference Divergence (PD) term that quantifies inter-aspect preference
conflicts. Instead of using this term for direct optimization, we leverage it
to formulate a novel, theoretically-grounded data selection principle. Our
principle advocates for selecting a subset of high-consensus data-identified by
the most negative PD values-for efficient DPO training. We prove the optimality
of this strategy by analyzing the loss bounds of the DMPO objective in the
selection problem. To operationalize our approach, we introduce practical
methods of PD term estimation and length bias mitigation, thereby proposing our
PD selection method. Evaluation on the UltraFeedback dataset with three varying
conflict levels shows that our simple yet effective strategy achieves over 10%
relative improvement against both the standard holistic preference and a
stronger oracle using aggregated preference signals, all while boosting
training efficiency and obviating the need for intractable holistic preference
annotating, unlocking the potential of robust LLM alignment via fine-grained
preference signals.

Abstract: While defenses against single-turn jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models
(LLMs) have improved significantly, multi-turn jailbreaks remain a persistent
vulnerability, often achieving success rates exceeding 70% against models
optimized for single-turn protection. This work presents an empirical analysis
of automated multi-turn jailbreak attacks across state-of-the-art models
including GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini variants, using the StrongREJECT benchmark.
Our findings challenge the perceived sophistication of multi-turn attacks: when
accounting for the attacker's ability to learn from how models refuse harmful
requests, multi-turn jailbreaking approaches are approximately equivalent to
simply resampling single-turn attacks multiple times. Moreover, attack success
is correlated among similar models, making it easier to jailbreak newly
released ones. Additionally, for reasoning models, we find surprisingly that
higher reasoning effort often leads to higher attack success rates. Our results
have important implications for AI safety evaluation and the design of
jailbreak-resistant systems. We release the source code at

Conclusion: 通过自适应调节图结构生成，提出的方法有效解决了动态空间相关性问题，显著提升了大气状态估计的预测精度。

Abstract: This study aims to discover spatial correlations between Earth observations
and atmospheric states to improve the forecasting accuracy of global
atmospheric state estimation, which are usually conducted using conventional
numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems and is the beginning of weather
forecasting. NWP systems predict future atmospheric states at fixed locations,
which are called NWP grid points, by analyzing previous atmospheric states and
newly acquired Earth observations without fixed locations. Thus, surrounding
meteorological context and the changing locations of the observations make
spatial correlations between atmospheric states and observations over time. To
handle complicated spatial correlations, which change dynamically, we employ
spatiotemporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) with structure learning. However,
structure learning has an inherent limitation that this can cause structural
information loss and over-smoothing problem by generating excessive edges. To
solve this problem, we regulate edge sampling by adaptively determining node
degrees and considering the spatial distances between NWP grid points and
observations. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method by using
real-world atmospheric state and observation data from East Asia. Even in areas
with high atmospheric variability, the proposed method outperformed existing
STGNN models with and without structure learning.

Conclusion: GLiClass为分类任务提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案，尤其适用于动态需求和数据稀疏场景。

Abstract: Classification is one of the most widespread tasks in AI applications,
serving often as the first step in filtering, sorting, and categorizing data.
Since modern AI systems must handle large volumes of input data and early
pipeline stages can propagate errors downstream, achieving high efficiency and
accuracy is critical. Moreover, classification requirements can change
dynamically based on user needs, necessitating models with strong zero-shot
capabilities. While generative LLMs have become mainstream for zero-shot
classification due to their versatility, they suffer from inconsistent
instruction following and computational inefficiency. Cross-encoders, commonly
used as rerankers in RAG pipelines, face a different bottleneck: they must
process text-label pairs sequentially, significantly reducing efficiency with
large label sets. Embedding-based approaches offer good efficiency but struggle
with complex scenarios involving logical and semantic constraints. We propose
GLiClass, a novel method that adapts the GLiNER architecture for sequence
classification tasks. Our approach achieves strong accuracy and efficiency
comparable to embedding-based methods, while maintaining the flexibility needed
for zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios. Additionally, we adapted
proximal policy optimization (PPO) for multi-label text classification,
enabling training classifiers in data-sparse conditions or from human feedback.

Abstract: With the increase in maritime traffic and the mandatory implementation of the
Automatic Identification System (AIS), the importance and diversity of maritime
traffic analysis tasks based on AIS data, such as vessel trajectory prediction,
anomaly detection, and collision risk assessment, is rapidly growing. However,
existing approaches tend to address these tasks individually, making it
difficult to holistically consider complex maritime situations. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel framework, AIS-LLM, which integrates time-series
AIS data with a large language model (LLM). AIS-LLM consists of a Time-Series
Encoder for processing AIS sequences, an LLM-based Prompt Encoder, a
Cross-Modality Alignment Module for semantic alignment between time-series data
and textual prompts, and an LLM-based Multi-Task Decoder. This architecture
enables the simultaneous execution of three key tasks: trajectory prediction,
anomaly detection, and risk assessment of vessel collisions within a single
end-to-end system. Experimental results demonstrate that AIS-LLM outperforms
existing methods across individual tasks, validating its effectiveness.
Furthermore, by integratively analyzing task outputs to generate situation
summaries and briefings, AIS-LLM presents the potential for more intelligent
and efficient maritime traffic management.

Conclusion: 该框架为语义缓存淘汰问题提供了理论基础，并在实际应用中表现出色。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing how users interact with
information systems, yet their high inference cost poses serious scalability
and sustainability challenges. Caching inference responses, allowing them to be
retrieved without another forward pass through the LLM, has emerged as one
possible solution. Traditional exact-match caching, however, overlooks the
semantic similarity between queries, leading to unnecessary recomputation.
Semantic caching addresses this by retrieving responses based on semantic
similarity, but introduces a fundamentally different cache eviction problem:
one must account for mismatch costs between incoming queries and cached
responses. Moreover, key system parameters, such as query arrival probabilities
and serving costs, are often unknown and must be learned over time. Existing
semantic caching methods are largely ad-hoc, lacking theoretical foundations
and unable to adapt to real-world uncertainty. In this paper, we present a
principled, learning-based framework for semantic cache eviction under unknown
query and cost distributions. We formulate both offline optimization and online
learning variants of the problem, and develop provably efficient algorithms
with state-of-the-art guarantees. We also evaluate our framework on a synthetic
dataset, showing that our proposed algorithms perform matching or superior
performance compared with baselines.

However, these social connections introduce privacy externalities: a client's
privacy loss depends not only on its privacy protection strategy but also on
the privacy decisions of others, propagated through the network via multi-hop
interactions. In this work, we propose a socially-aware privacy-preserving FL
mechanism that systematically quantifies indirect privacy leakage through a
multi-hop propagation model. We formulate the server-client interaction as a
two-stage Stackelberg game, where the server, as the leader, optimizes
incentive policies, and clients, as followers, strategically select their
privacy budgets, which determine their privacy-preserving levels by controlling
the magnitude of added noise. To mitigate information asymmetry in networked
privacy estimation, we introduce a mean-field estimator to approximate the
average external privacy risk. We theoretically prove the existence and
convergence of the fixed point of the mean-field estimator and derive
closed-form expressions for the Stackelberg Nash Equilibrium. Despite being
designed from a client-centric incentive perspective, our mechanism achieves
approximately-optimal social welfare, as revealed by Price of Anarchy (PoA)
analysis. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves client utilities and reduces server costs while
maintaining model performance, outperforming both Social-Agnostic (SA)
baselines and methods that account for social externalities.

TL;DR: MORE-CLEAR框架利用多模态离线强化学习和临床笔记，通过预训练语言模型提升脓毒症管理的状态表示和策略性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脓毒症早期检测和管理至关重要，现有强化学习方法依赖结构化数据，缺乏对患者状态的全面理解。

Method: 结合预训练语言模型提取临床笔记的语义信息，通过门控融合和跨模态注意力动态整合多模态数据。

Result: 在公开和私有数据集上验证，MORE-CLEAR显著提升生存率和策略性能。

Conclusion: 首次将语言模型能力引入多模态离线强化学习，为医疗应用提供更全面的状态表示，有望改善脓毒症管理。

Abstract: Sepsis, a life-threatening inflammatory response to infection, causes organ
dysfunction, making early detection and optimal management critical. Previous
reinforcement learning (RL) approaches to sepsis management rely primarily on
structured data, such as lab results or vital signs, and on a dearth of a
comprehensive understanding of the patient's condition. In this work, we
propose a Multimodal Offline REinforcement learning for Clinical notes
Leveraged Enhanced stAte Representation (MORE-CLEAR) framework for sepsis
control in intensive care units. MORE-CLEAR employs pre-trained large-scale
language models (LLMs) to facilitate the extraction of rich semantic
representations from clinical notes, preserving clinical context and improving
patient state representation. Gated fusion and cross-modal attention allow
dynamic weight adjustment in the context of time and the effective integration
of multimodal data. Extensive cross-validation using two public (MIMIC-III and
MIMIC-IV) and one private dataset demonstrates that MORE-CLEAR significantly
improves estimated survival rate and policy performance compared to
single-modal RL approaches. To our knowledge, this is the first to leverage LLM
capabilities within a multimodal offline RL for better state representation in
medical applications. This approach can potentially expedite the treatment and
management of sepsis by enabling reinforcement learning models to propose
enhanced actions based on a more comprehensive understanding of patient
conditions.

Conclusion: SE-LLM通过语义增强和短期依赖建模，显著提升了时间序列分析的性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a significant role in finance, energy,
meteorology, and IoT applications. Recent studies have leveraged the
generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to adapt to time
series forecasting, achieving promising performance. However, existing studies
focus on token-level modal alignment, instead of bridging the intrinsic
modality gap between linguistic knowledge structures and time series data
patterns, greatly limiting the semantic representation. To address this issue,
we propose a novel Semantic-Enhanced LLM (SE-LLM) that explores the inherent
periodicity and anomalous characteristics of time series to embed into the
semantic space to enhance the token embedding. This process enhances the
interpretability of tokens for LLMs, thereby activating the potential of LLMs
for temporal sequence analysis. Moreover, existing Transformer-based LLMs excel
at capturing long-range dependencies but are weak at modeling short-term
anomalies in time-series data. Hence, we propose a plugin module embedded
within self-attention that models long-term and short-term dependencies to
effectively adapt LLMs to time-series analysis. Our approach freezes the LLM
and reduces the sequence dimensionality of tokens, greatly reducing
computational consumption. Experiments demonstrate the superiority performance
of our SE-LLM against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了神经网络训练扩展与能耗的复杂关系，为可持续AI研究提供了参考。

Abstract: The increasing demand for computational resources of training neural networks
leads to a concerning growth in energy consumption. While parallelization has
enabled upscaling model and dataset sizes and accelerated training, its impact
on energy consumption is often overlooked. To close this research gap, we
conducted scaling experiments for data-parallel training of two models,
ResNet50 and FourCastNet, and evaluated the impact of parallelization
parameters, i.e., GPU count, global batch size, and local batch size, on
predictive performance, training time, and energy consumption. We show that
energy consumption scales approximately linearly with the consumed resources,
i.e., GPU hours; however, the respective scaling factor differs substantially
between distinct model trainings and hardware, and is systematically influenced
by the number of samples and gradient updates per GPU hour. Our results shed
light on the complex interplay of scaling up neural network training and can
inform future developments towards more sustainable AI research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ANN-to-SNN转换方法在Transformer架构中处理非线性操作效果不佳且需额外微调，限制了Spiking Transformers的高效部署。

Method: 引入多基指数衰减（MBE）神经元，通过指数衰减策略和多基编码方法高效近似非线性操作，无需修改预训练ANN的权重。

Result: 在多种任务（CV、NLU、NLG）和主流Transformer架构（ViT、RoBERTa、GPT-2）上实现了接近无损的转换精度，且延迟显著降低。

Conclusion: 该方法为Spiking Transformers的高效、可扩展部署提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Leveraging the event-driven paradigm, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a
promising approach for constructing energy-efficient Transformer architectures.
Compared to directly trained Spiking Transformers, ANN-to-SNN conversion
methods bypass the high training costs. However, existing methods still suffer
from notable limitations, failing to effectively handle nonlinear operations in
Transformer architectures and requiring additional fine-tuning processes for
pre-trained ANNs. To address these issues, we propose a high-performance and
training-free ANN-to-SNN conversion framework tailored for Transformer
architectures. Specifically, we introduce a Multi-basis Exponential Decay (MBE)
neuron, which employs an exponential decay strategy and multi-basis encoding
method to efficiently approximate various nonlinear operations. It removes the
requirement for weight modifications in pre-trained ANNs. Extensive experiments
across diverse tasks (CV, NLU, NLG) and mainstream Transformer architectures
(ViT, RoBERTa, GPT-2) demonstrate that our method achieves near-lossless
conversion accuracy with significantly lower latency. This provides a promising
pathway for the efficient and scalable deployment of Spiking Transformers in
real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络会记忆损坏的标签，而现实数据集常受标签噪声和输入噪声影响，数据质量对模型性能至关重要。

Method: 计算每个样本对整体互信息的点贡献，低贡献样本表明为噪声或错误标签实例。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上验证，该方法能有效过滤低质量样本，标签损坏情况下训练高互信息样本可使分类准确率提升15%。

Conclusion: 该方法对良性输入修改具有鲁棒性，能保留语义有效数据并过滤真正损坏的样本。

Abstract: Deep neural networks can memorize corrupted labels, making data quality
critical for model performance, yet real-world datasets are frequently
compromised by both label noise and input noise. This paper proposes a mutual
information-based framework for data selection under hybrid noise scenarios
that quantifies statistical dependencies between inputs and labels. We compute
each sample's pointwise contribution to the overall mutual information and find
that lower contributions indicate noisy or mislabeled instances. Empirical
validation on MNIST with different synthetic noise settings demonstrates that
the method effectively filters low-quality samples. Under label corruption,
training on high-MI samples improves classification accuracy by up to 15\%
compared to random sampling. Furthermore, the method exhibits robustness to
benign input modifications, preserving semantically valid data while filtering
truly corrupted samples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL代理需要即时感知状态变化，但在无线通信网络中，状态更新可能因延迟或丢包而变得不完整或间歇性，现有解决方案计算负担重且不够通用。

Method: HR3L采用双单元架构：发射器编码环境状态，接收器解码并执行动作以最大化奖励信号，无需交换梯度信息。

Result: 实验表明，HR3L在样本效率和适应不同通信场景（如丢包、延迟和容量限制）方面显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HR3L提供了一种高效且适应性强的解决方案，适用于非理想通信环境下的RL训练。

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of training Reinforcement Learning (RL)
agents over communication networks. The RL paradigm requires the agent to
instantaneously perceive the state evolution to infer the effects of its
actions on the environment. This is impossible if the agent receives state
updates over lossy or delayed wireless systems and thus operates with partial
and intermittent information. In recent years, numerous frameworks have been
proposed to manage RL with imperfect feedback; however, they often offer
specific solutions with a substantial computational burden. To address these
limits, we propose a novel architecture, named Homomorphic Robust Remote
Reinforcement Learning (HR3L), that enables the training of remote RL agents
exchanging observations across a non-ideal wireless channel. HR3L considers two
units: the transmitter, which encodes meaningful representations of the
environment, and the receiver, which decodes these messages and performs
actions to maximize a reward signal. Importantly, HR3L does not require the
exchange of gradient information across the wireless channel, allowing for
quicker training and a lower communication overhead than state-of-the-art
solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that HR3L significantly outperforms
baseline methods in terms of sample efficiency and adapts to different
communication scenarios, including packet losses, delayed transmissions, and
capacity limitations.

Motivation: 多域持续学习面临任务类别和分布变化的双重异质性，现有方法难以同时解决灾难性遗忘和前瞻遗忘问题。

Method: TRGE方法通过动态扩展预训练CLIP模型，为每个任务分配专家组，并设计组内和组间路由策略。同时利用MLLMs生成任务描述和识别任务标识符。

Result: 实验表明，TRGE在多种设置下优于其他先进方法，且训练参数更少。

Conclusion: TRGE通过动态路由和任务标识符识别，有效解决了多域持续学习中的遗忘问题。

Abstract: Multi-Domain Continual Learning (MDCL) acquires knowledge from sequential
tasks with shifting class sets and distribution. Despite the
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods can adapt for this dual
heterogeneity, they still suffer from catastrophic forgetting and forward
forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose a Two-Level Routing Grouped
Mixture-of-Experts (TRGE) method. Firstly, TRGE dynamically expands the
pre-trained CLIP model, assigning specific expert group for each task to
mitigate catastrophic forgetting. With the number of experts continually grows
in this process, TRGE maintains the static experts count within the group and
introduces the intra-group router to alleviate routing overfitting caused by
the increasing routing complexity. Meanwhile, we design an inter-group routing
policy based on task identifiers and task prototype distance, which dynamically
selects relevant expert groups and combines their outputs to enhance inter-task
collaboration. Secondly, to get the correct task identifiers, we leverage
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) which own powerful multimodal
comprehension capabilities to generate semantic task descriptions and recognize
the correct task identifier. Finally, to mitigate forward forgetting, we
dynamically fuse outputs for unseen samples from the frozen CLIP model and TRGE
adapter based on training progress, leveraging both pre-trained and learned
knowledge. Through extensive experiments across various settings, our method
outperforms other advanced methods with fewer trainable parameters.

Conclusion: 理论条件不仅是证明工具，也揭示了算法限制，推动在条件不满足时寻求创新方案。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to optimize the return given a fixed
dataset of agent trajectories without additional interactions with the
environment. While algorithm development has progressed rapidly, significant
theoretical advances have also been made in understanding the fundamental
challenges of offline RL. However, bridging these theoretical insights with
practical algorithm design remains an ongoing challenge. In this survey, we
explore key intuitions derived from theoretical work and their implications for
offline RL algorithms.
  We begin by listing the conditions needed for the proofs, including function
representation and data coverage assumptions. Function representation
conditions tell us what to expect for generalization, and data coverage
assumptions describe the quality requirement of the data. We then examine
counterexamples, where offline RL is not solvable without an impractically
large amount of data. These cases highlight what cannot be achieved for all
algorithms and the inherent hardness of offline RL. Building on techniques to
mitigate these challenges, we discuss the conditions that are sufficient for
offline RL. These conditions are not merely assumptions for theoretical proofs,
but they also reveal the limitations of these algorithms and remind us to
search for novel solutions when the conditions cannot be satisfied.

Conclusion: GRAO为语言模型对齐提供了理论框架和实证支持，显著提升了效率和性能。

Abstract: Alignment methodologies have emerged as a critical pathway for enhancing
language model alignment capabilities. While SFT (supervised fine-tuning)
accelerates convergence through direct token-level loss intervention, its
efficacy is constrained by offline policy trajectory. In contrast,
RL(reinforcement learning) facilitates exploratory policy optimization, but
suffers from low sample efficiency and stringent dependency on high-quality
base models. To address these dual challenges, we propose GRAO (Group Relative
Alignment Optimization), a unified framework that synergizes the respective
strengths of SFT and RL through three key innovations: 1) A multi-sample
generation strategy enabling comparative quality assessment via reward
feedback; 2) A novel Group Direct Alignment Loss formulation leveraging
intra-group relative advantage weighting; 3) Reference-aware parameter updates
guided by pairwise preference dynamics. Our theoretical analysis establishes
GRAO's convergence guarantees and sample efficiency advantages over
conventional approaches. Comprehensive evaluations across complex human
alignment tasks demonstrate GRAO's superior performance, achieving
57.70\%,17.65\% 7.95\% and 5.18\% relative improvements over SFT, DPO, PPO and
GRPO baselines respectively. This work provides both a theoretically grounded
alignment framework and empirical evidence for efficient capability evolution

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于RLHF的对齐方法仅优化单一奖励函数，导致模型行为僵化，无法适应多样的人类偏好，因此需要探索多目标对齐方法。

Method: 提出PAMA算法，将多目标RLHF转化为凸优化问题，提供闭式解，将复杂度从O(n^2*d)降至O(n)。

Result: 实验证明PAMA在125M至7B参数的模型中表现优异，能够高效收敛到帕累托稳定点。

Conclusion: PAMA为多目标对齐提供了高效且理论可靠的解决方案，推动了LLMs在现实应用中的多样性和适应性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications that require careful balancing of multiple, often conflicting,
objectives, such as informativeness versus conciseness, or helpfulness versus
creativity. However, current alignment methods, primarily based on RLHF,
optimize LLMs toward a single reward function, resulting in rigid behavior that
fails to capture the complexity and diversity of human preferences. This
limitation hinders the adaptability of LLMs to practical scenarios, making
multi-objective alignment (MOA) a critical yet underexplored area. To bridge
this gap, we propose Pareto Multi-Objective Alignment (PAMA), a principled and
computationally efficient algorithm designed explicitly for MOA in LLMs. In
contrast to computationally prohibitive multi-objective optimization (MOO)
methods, PAMA transforms multi-objective RLHF into a convex optimization with a
closed-form solution, significantly enhancing scalability. Traditional MOO
approaches suffer from prohibitive O(n^2*d) complexity, where d represents the
number of model parameters, typically in the billions for LLMs, rendering
direct optimization infeasible. PAMA reduces this complexity to O(n) where n is
the number of objectives, enabling optimization to be completed within
milliseconds. We provide theoretical guarantees that PAMA converges to a Pareto
stationary point, where no objective can be improved without degrading at least
one other. Extensive experiments across language models ranging from 125M to 7B
parameters demonstrate PAMA's robust and effective MOA capabilities, aligning
with its theoretical advantages. PAMA provides a highly efficient solution to
the MOA problem that was previously considered intractable, offering a
practical and theoretically grounded approach to aligning LLMs with diverse
human values, paving the way for versatile and adaptable real-world AI
deployments.

Motivation: 深度生成模型（DGMs）虽然表达能力强，但由于非线性特性导致概率推断难以解析计算（即不可解）。现有的概率图电路（PGCs）虽解决了可解性问题，但其复杂度为O(n²)，对稀疏图不高效。

Conclusion: SPGCs是一种高效且可解的生成模型，适用于稀疏图，解决了现有方法的可扩展性问题。

Abstract: Deep generative models (DGMs) for graphs achieve impressively high expressive
power thanks to very efficient and scalable neural networks. However, these
networks contain non-linearities that prevent analytical computation of many
standard probabilistic inference queries, i.e., these DGMs are considered
\emph{intractable}. While recently proposed Probabilistic Graph Circuits (PGCs)
address this issue by enabling \emph{tractable} probabilistic inference, they
operate on dense graph representations with $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ complexity for
graphs with $n$ nodes and \emph{$m$ edges}. To address this scalability issue,
we introduce Sparse PGCs, a new class of tractable generative models that
operate directly on sparse graph representation, reducing the complexity to
$\mathcal{O}(n + m)$, which is particularly beneficial for $m \ll n^2$. In the
context of de novo drug design, we empirically demonstrate that SPGCs retain
exact inference capabilities, improve memory efficiency and inference speed,
and match the performance of intractable DGMs in key metrics.

Result: 实验表明，知识可以在相同或不同组织的相似业务流程间迁移，实现有效的PPM。

Conclusion: 该技术为组织提供了一种资源高效的方式，支持跨边界迁移学习应用。

Abstract: Event logs reflect the behavior of business processes that are mapped in
organizational information systems. Predictive process monitoring (PPM)
transforms these data into value by creating process-related predictions that
provide the insights required for proactive interventions at process runtime.
Existing PPM techniques require sufficient amounts of event data or other
relevant resources that might not be readily available, preventing some
organizations from utilizing PPM. The transfer learning-based PPM technique
presented in this paper allows organizations without suitable event data or
other relevant resources to implement PPM for effective decision support. The
technique is instantiated in two real-life use cases, based on which numerical
experiments are performed using event logs for IT service management processes
in an intra- and inter-organizational setting. The results of the experiments
suggest that knowledge of one business process can be transferred to a similar
business process in the same or a different organization to enable effective
PPM in the target context. With the proposed technique, organizations can
benefit from transfer learning in an intra- and inter-organizational setting,
where resources like pre-trained models are transferred within and across
organizational boundaries.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning for LLM reasoning has rapidly emerged as a prominent
research area, marked by a significant surge in related studies on both
algorithmic innovations and practical applications. Despite this progress,
several critical challenges remain, including the absence of standardized
guidelines for employing RL techniques and a fragmented understanding of their
underlying mechanisms. Additionally, inconsistent experimental settings,
variations in training data, and differences in model initialization have led
to conflicting conclusions, obscuring the key characteristics of these
techniques and creating confusion among practitioners when selecting
appropriate techniques. This paper systematically reviews widely adopted RL
techniques through rigorous reproductions and isolated evaluations within a
unified open-source framework. We analyze the internal mechanisms, applicable
scenarios, and core principles of each technique through fine-grained
experiments, including datasets of varying difficulty, model sizes, and
architectures. Based on these insights, we present clear guidelines for
selecting RL techniques tailored to specific setups, and provide a reliable
roadmap for practitioners navigating the RL for the LLM domain. Finally, we
reveal that a minimalist combination of two techniques can unlock the learning
capability of critic-free policies using vanilla PPO loss. The results
demonstrate that our simple combination consistently improves performance,
surpassing strategies like GRPO and DAPO.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) has become a promising
paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs) to improve their
reasoning capability. However, when the rollout accuracy is low on hard
problems, the reward becomes sparse, limiting learning efficiency and causing
exploration bottlenecks. Existing approaches either rely on stronger LLMs for
distillation or filter out difficult problems, which limits scalability or
restricts reasoning improvement through exploration.
  We propose EvoCoT, a self-evolving curriculum learning framework based on
two-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning optimization. EvoCoT constrains the
exploration space by self-generating and verifying CoT trajectories, then
gradually shortens them to expand the space in a controlled way. This enables
LLMs to stably learn from initially unsolved hard problems under sparse
rewards. We apply EvoCoT to multiple LLM families, including Qwen, DeepSeek,
and Llama. Experiments show that EvoCoT enables LLMs to solve previously
unsolved problems, improves reasoning capability without external CoT
supervision, and is compatible with various RL fine-tuning methods. We release
the source code to support future research.

*Carlo Cena,Mauro Martini,Marcello Chiaberge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在航天器姿态控制中，结合物理信息的神经网络（PINNs）相比纯数据驱动方法的优势，结果显示PINNs显著提升了性能和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在物理模型不完整或计算成本高的情况下，纯数据驱动方法泛化性和稳定性不足，因此研究如何通过结合物理信息提升模型性能。

Method: 使用Real NVP神经网络架构和自注意力机制，训练了纯数据驱动和物理信息两种模型，并在Basilisk模拟器生成的数据上进行测试。

Result: 物理信息模型的平均相对误差降低了27.08%，在MPC框架中控制精度和鲁棒性提升高达42.86%。

Conclusion: 结合物理信息的神经网络显著优于纯数据驱动方法，尤其在控制精度和稳定性方面表现突出。

Abstract: Attitude control is a fundamental aspect of spacecraft operations. Model
Predictive Control (MPC) has emerged as a powerful strategy for these tasks,
relying on accurate models of the system dynamics to optimize control actions
over a prediction horizon. In scenarios where physics models are incomplete,
difficult to derive, or computationally expensive, machine learning offers a
flexible alternative by learning the system behavior directly from data.
However, purely data-driven models often struggle with generalization and
stability, especially when applied to inputs outside their training domain. To
address these limitations, we investigate the benefits of incorporating
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) into the learning of spacecraft
attitude dynamics, comparing their performance with that of purely data-driven
approaches. Using a Real-valued Non-Volume Preserving (Real NVP) neural network
architecture with a self-attention mechanism, we trained several models on
simulated data generated with the Basilisk simulator. Two training strategies
were considered: a purely data-driven baseline and a physics-informed variant
to improve robustness and stability. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion
of physics-based information significantly enhances the performance in terms of
the mean relative error of the best architectures found by 27.08%. These
advantages are particularly evident when the learned models are integrated into
an MPC framework, where PINN-based models consistently outperform their purely
data-driven counterparts in terms of control accuracy and robustness, yielding
improvements of up to 42.86% in performance stability error and increased
robustness-to-noise.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了模拟器在科学实践中的重要性，并以AlphaFold为例说明其价值。作者评估了Binz等人提出的Centaur模型作为行为科学中的参与者模拟器的潜力，发现其预测准确但生成行为与人类数据存在系统性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨模拟器（如AlphaFold）在科学中的作用，并评估Centaur作为行为科学中参与者模拟器的可行性。

Method: 回顾参与者模拟器的核心标准，并评估Centaur模型在预测准确性和生成行为方面的表现。

Result: Centaur在预测准确性上表现良好，但其生成行为与人类数据存在系统性差异。

Conclusion: Centaur在预测人类行为方面迈出了重要一步，但尚未达到可靠参与者模拟器或准确认知模型的标准。

Abstract: Simulators have revolutionized scientific practice across the natural
sciences. By generating data that reliably approximate real-world phenomena,
they enable scientists to accelerate hypothesis testing and optimize
experimental designs. This is perhaps best illustrated by AlphaFold, a
Nobel-prize winning simulator in chemistry that predicts protein structures
from amino acid sequences, enabling rapid prototyping of molecular
interactions, drug targets, and protein functions. In the behavioral sciences,
a reliable participant simulator - a system capable of producing human-like
behavior across cognitive tasks - would represent a similarly transformative
advance. Recently, Binz et al. introduced Centaur, a large language model (LLM)
fine-tuned on human data from 160 experiments, proposing its use not only as a
model of cognition but also as a participant simulator for "in silico
prototyping of experimental studies", e.g., to advance automated cognitive
science. Here, we review the core criteria for a participant simulator and
assess how well Centaur meets them. Although Centaur demonstrates strong
predictive accuracy, its generative behavior - a critical criterion for a
participant simulator - systematically diverges from human data. This suggests
that, while Centaur is a significant step toward predicting human behavior, it
does not yet meet the standards of a reliable participant simulator or an
accurate model of cognition.

*Liang Hou,Yuan Gao,Boyuan Jiang,Xin Tao,Qi Yan,Renjie Liao,Pengfei Wan,Di Zhang,Kun Gai*

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ScoreAug的新型数据增强框架，专门针对扩散模型中的过拟合问题，通过在噪声数据上应用变换来提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成建模中表现出色，但在数据有限的情况下容易过拟合。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出ScoreAug框架，对噪声数据进行变换，并要求去噪器预测原始目标的增强版本，从而实现跨不同去噪空间的分数学习。

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了ScoreAug的有效性，显著提升了性能并缓解了过拟合问题。

Conclusion: ScoreAug不仅解决了扩散模型中的过拟合问题，还能与传统数据增强技术结合，进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling.
However, this study confirms the existence of overfitting in diffusion model
training, particularly in data-limited regimes. To address this challenge, we
propose Score Augmentation (ScoreAug), a novel data augmentation framework
specifically designed for diffusion models. Unlike conventional augmentation
approaches that operate on clean data, ScoreAug applies transformations to
noisy data, aligning with the inherent denoising mechanism of diffusion.
Crucially, ScoreAug further requires the denoiser to predict the augmentation
of the original target. This design establishes an equivariant learning
objective, enabling the denoiser to learn scores across varied denoising
spaces, thereby realizing what we term score augmentation. We also
theoretically analyze the relationship between scores in different spaces under
general transformations. In experiments, we extensively validate ScoreAug on
multiple benchmarks including CIFAR-10, FFHQ, AFHQv2, and ImageNet, with
results demonstrating significant performance improvements over baselines.
Notably, ScoreAug effectively mitigates overfitting across diverse scenarios,
such as varying data scales and model capacities, while exhibiting stable
convergence properties. Another advantage of ScoreAug over standard data
augmentation lies in its ability to circumvent data leakage issues under
certain conditions. Furthermore, we show that ScoreAug can be synergistically
combined with traditional data augmentation techniques to achieve additional
performance gains.

Result: 在多种DNN架构上实现了显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 该框架通用性强，适用于不同DNN架构，能有效应对非平稳性。

Abstract: Time series forecasting poses significant challenges in non-stationary
environments where underlying patterns evolve over time. In this work, we
propose a novel framework that enhances deep neural network (DNN) performance
by leveraging specialized model adaptation and selection. Initially, a base DNN
is trained offline on historical time series data. A reserved validation subset
is then segmented to extract and cluster the most dominant patterns within the
series, thereby identifying distinct regimes. For each identified cluster, the
base DNN is fine-tuned to produce a specialized version that captures unique
pattern characteristics. At inference, the most recent input is matched against
the cluster centroids, and the corresponding fine-tuned version is deployed
based on the closest similarity measure. Additionally, our approach integrates
a concept drift detection mechanism to identify and adapt to emerging patterns
caused by non-stationary behavior. The proposed framework is generalizable
across various DNN architectures and has demonstrated significant performance
gains on both traditional DNNs and recent advanced architectures implemented in
the GluonTS library.

TL;DR: SHARK是一种基于Shapley值的特征加权聚类算法，无需额外参数调优，通过分解k-means目标函数为Shapley值实现高效计算，实验表明其在噪声环境下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维或噪声数据中特征权重不均的问题，避免传统方法需要额外参数调优的缺点。

Method: 利用Shapley值量化特征相关性，将k-means目标分解为Shapley值之和，并通过迭代特征加权优化聚类。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，SHARK表现优于现有方法，尤其在噪声环境下具有更高的鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: SHARK为无监督特征相关性提供了理论支持，并在实际应用中展现了优越性能。

Abstract: Clustering algorithms often assume all features contribute equally to the
data structure, an assumption that usually fails in high-dimensional or noisy
settings. Feature weighting methods can address this, but most require
additional parameter tuning. We propose SHARK (Shapley Reweighted $k$-means), a
feature-weighted clustering algorithm motivated by the use of Shapley values
from cooperative game theory to quantify feature relevance, which requires no
additional parameters beyond those in $k$-means. We prove that the $k$-means
objective can be decomposed into a sum of per-feature Shapley values, providing
an axiomatic foundation for unsupervised feature relevance and reducing Shapley
computation from exponential to polynomial time. SHARK iteratively re-weights
features by the inverse of their Shapley contribution, emphasising informative
dimensions and down-weighting irrelevant ones. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world data sets show that SHARK consistently matches or outperforms
existing methods, achieving superior robustness and accuracy, particularly in
scenarios where noise may be present. Software:

Conclusion: WeChat-YATT是一个高效、可扩展的RLHF训练框架，适用于大规模实际应用。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a prominent
paradigm for training large language models and multimodal systems. Despite
notable advances enabled by existing RLHF training frameworks, significant
challenges remain in scaling to complex multimodal workflows and adapting to
dynamic workloads. In particular, current systems often encounter limitations
related to controller scalability when managing large models, as well as
inefficiencies in orchestrating intricate RLHF pipelines, especially in
scenarios that require dynamic sampling and resource allocation. In this paper,
we introduce WeChat-YATT (Yet Another Transformer Trainer in WeChat), a simple,
scalable, and balanced RLHF training framework specifically designed to address
these challenges. WeChat-YATT features a parallel controller programming model
that enables flexible and efficient orchestration of complex RLHF workflows,
effectively mitigating the bottlenecks associated with centralized controller
architectures and facilitating scalability in large-scale data scenarios. In
addition, we propose a dynamic placement schema that adaptively partitions
computational resources and schedules workloads, thereby significantly reducing
hardware idle time and improving GPU utilization under variable training
conditions. We evaluate WeChat-YATT across a range of experimental scenarios,
demonstrating that it achieves substantial improvements in throughput compared
to state-of-the-art RLHF training frameworks. Furthermore, WeChat-YATT has been
successfully deployed to train models supporting WeChat product features for a
large-scale user base, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in
real-world applications.

Motivation: 交通状态估计（TSE）现有方法分为模型驱动、数据驱动和模型-数据双驱动三类，但各有局限性。本文旨在结合物理模型和数据驱动的优势，提出更准确的TSE方法。

Method: 扩展了PI-DeepONet架构，支持2D数据输入、引入非线性扩展层、注意力机制和MIMO机制，并设计了自适应识别交通流模型参数的神经网络。

Conclusion: 基于扩展PI-DeepONet的TSE方法显著提升了估计精度，为交通状态估计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Traffic state estimation (TSE) falls methodologically into three categories:
model-driven, data-driven, and model-data dual-driven. Model-driven TSE relies
on macroscopic traffic flow models originated from hydrodynamics. Data-driven
TSE leverages historical sensing data and employs statistical models or machine
learning methods to infer traffic state. Model-data dual-driven traffic state
estimation attempts to harness the strengths of both aspects to achieve more
accurate TSE. From the perspective of mathematical operator theory, TSE can be
viewed as a type of operator that maps available measurements of inerested
traffic state into unmeasured traffic state variables in real time. For the
first time this paper proposes to study real-time freeway TSE in the idea of
physics-informed deep operator network (PI-DeepONet), which is an
operator-oriented architecture embedding traffic flow models based on deep
neural networks. The paper has developed an extended architecture from the
original PI-DeepONet. The extended architecture is featured with: (1) the
acceptance of 2-D data input so as to support CNN-based computations; (2) the
introduction of a nonlinear expansion layer, an attention mechanism, and a MIMO
mechanism; (3) dedicated neural network design for adaptive identification of
traffic flow model parameters. A traffic state estimator built on the basis of
this extended PI-DeepONet architecture was evaluated with respect to a short
freeway stretch of NGSIM and a large-scale urban expressway in China, along
with other four baseline TSE methods. The evaluation results demonstrated that
this novel TSE method outperformed the baseline methods with high-precision
estimation results of flow and mean speed.

Motivation: 现有研究表明，没有单一的最大团算法在所有情况下表现最佳，但缺乏针对最大团问题的算法选择研究。

Method: 构建了一个标记数据集，评估了四种传统分类器，并开发了一种名为GAT-MLP的双通道模型，结合图注意力网络和多层感知机。

Result: 随机森林表现稳定，GAT-MLP模型在所有指标上表现优异。

Conclusion: 双通道架构和图神经网络在组合算法选择中具有潜力。

Abstract: Extensive experiments and prior studies show that no single maximum clique
algorithm consistently performs best across all instances, highlighting the
importance of selecting suitable algorithms based on instance features. Through
an extensive analysis of relevant studies, it is found that there is a lack of
research work concerning algorithm selection oriented toward the Maximum Clique
Problem (MCP). In this work, we propose a learning-based framework that
integrates both traditional machine learning and graph neural networks to
address this gap. We construct a labeled dataset by running four exact MCP
algorithms on a diverse collection of graph instances, accompanied by
structural and global statistical features extracted from each graph. We first
evaluate four conventional classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random
Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), across multiple
dataset variants. Experimental results show that RF consistently shows strong
performance across metrics and dataset variants, making it a reliable baseline.
In addition, feature importance analysis indicates that connectivity and
topological structure are strong predictors of algorithm performance. Building
on these findings, we develop a dual-channel model named GAT-MLP, which
combines a Graph Attention Network (GAT) for local structural encoding with a
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for global feature modeling. The GAT-MLP model
shows strong and consistent performance across all metrics. Our results
highlight the effectiveness of dual-channel architectures and the promise of
graph neural networks in combinatorial algorithm selection.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效减少了通信开销，同时考虑了异步设备的影响。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging learning framework that enables edge
devices to collaboratively train ML models without sharing their local data. FL
faces, however, a significant challenge due to the high amount of information
that must be exchanged between the devices and the aggregator in the training
phase, which can exceed the limited capacity of wireless systems. In this
paper, two communication-efficient FL methods are considered where
communication overhead is reduced by communicating scalar values instead of
long vectors and by allowing high number of users to send information
simultaneously. The first approach employs a zero-order optimization technique
with two-point gradient estimator, while the second involves a first-order
gradient computation strategy. The novelty lies in leveraging channel
information in the learning algorithms, eliminating hence the need for
additional resources to acquire channel state information (CSI) and to remove
its impact, as well as in considering asynchronous devices. We provide a
rigorous analytical framework for the two methods, deriving convergence
guarantees and establishing appropriate performance bounds.

Abstract: Accurate power consumption prediction is crucial for improving efficiency and
reducing environmental impact, yet traditional methods relying on specialized
instruments or rigid physical models are impractical for large-scale,
real-world deployment. This study introduces a scalable data-driven method
using powertrain dynamic feature sets and both traditional machine learning and
deep neural networks to estimate instantaneous and cumulative power consumption
in internal combustion engine (ICE), electric vehicle (EV), and hybrid electric
vehicle (HEV) platforms. ICE models achieved high instantaneous accuracy with
mean absolute error and root mean squared error on the order of $10^{-3}$, and
cumulative errors under 3%. Transformer and long short-term memory models
performed best for EVs and HEVs, with cumulative errors below 4.1% and 2.1%,
respectively. Results confirm the approach's effectiveness across vehicles and
models. Uncertainty analysis revealed greater variability in EV and HEV
datasets than ICE, due to complex power management, emphasizing the need for
robust models for advanced powertrains.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了基于提示的联邦学习在实际部署中的脆弱性，呼吁加强其安全性。

Abstract: Prompt-based tuning has emerged as a lightweight alternative to full
fine-tuning in large vision-language models, enabling efficient adaptation via
learned contextual prompts. This paradigm has recently been extended to
federated learning settings (e.g., PromptFL), where clients collaboratively
train prompts under data privacy constraints. However, the security
implications of prompt-based aggregation in federated multimodal learning
remain largely unexplored, leaving a critical attack surface unaddressed. In
this paper, we introduce \textbf{BadPromptFL}, the first backdoor attack
targeting prompt-based federated learning in multimodal contrastive models. In
BadPromptFL, compromised clients jointly optimize local backdoor triggers and
prompt embeddings, injecting poisoned prompts into the global aggregation
process. These prompts are then propagated to benign clients, enabling
universal backdoor activation at inference without modifying model parameters.
Leveraging the contextual learning behavior of CLIP-style architectures,
BadPromptFL achieves high attack success rates (e.g., \(>90\%\)) with minimal
visibility and limited client participation. Extensive experiments across
multiple datasets and aggregation protocols validate the effectiveness,
stealth, and generalizability of our attack, raising critical concerns about
the robustness of prompt-based federated learning in real-world deployments.

Abstract: The stability-plasticity dilemma, closely related to a neural network's (NN)
capacity-its ability to represent tasks-is a fundamental challenge in continual
learning (CL). Within this context, we introduce CL's effective model capacity
(CLEMC) that characterizes the dynamic behavior of the stability-plasticity
balance point. We develop a difference equation to model the evolution of the
interplay between the NN, task data, and optimization procedure. We then
leverage CLEMC to demonstrate that the effective capacity-and, by extension,
the stability-plasticity balance point is inherently non-stationary. We show
that regardless of the NN architecture or optimization method, a NN's ability
to represent new tasks diminishes when incoming task distributions differ from
previous ones. We conduct extensive experiments to support our theoretical
findings, spanning a range of architectures-from small feedforward network and
convolutional networks to medium-sized graph neural networks and
transformer-based large language models with millions of parameters.

Abstract: Connecting an ever-expanding catalogue of products with suitable

aligns and aggregates textual and visual attributes into intermediate group

Motivation: 传统逻辑优化算子计算成本高，且大部分尝试失败，需要更高效的方法。

Method: 利用分类器预剪枝无效切割，避免不必要的重合成操作。

Conclusion: 分类器预剪枝方法能有效减少计算成本，提升逻辑优化效率。

Abstract: In electronic design automation, logic optimization operators play a crucial
role in minimizing the gate count of logic circuits. However, their computation
demands are high. Operators such as refactor conventionally form iterative cuts
for each node, striving for a more compact representation - a task which often
fails 98% on average. Prior research has sought to mitigate computational cost
through parallelization. In contrast, our approach leverages a classifier to
prune unsuccessful cuts preemptively, thus eliminating unnecessary resynthesis
operations. Experiments on the refactor operator using the EPFL benchmark suite
and 10 large industrial designs demonstrate that this technique can speedup
logic optimization by 3.9x on average compared with the state-of-the-art ABC
implementation.

applied to create interpretable estimates of the average of the outcome, it is
currently not well understood how it can be used to estimate the relationship
between variables at other points in the distribution of the target variable.
Such estimates of e.g. the median or an extreme value provide a fuller picture
of how predictive variables affect the outcome and are necessary in
high-stakes, safety-critical application domains. This study introduces
Symbolic Quantile Regression (SQR), an approach to predict conditional
quantiles with SR. In an extensive evaluation, we find that SQR outperforms
transparent models and performs comparably to a strong black-box baseline
without compromising transparency. We also show how SQR can be used to explain
differences in the target distribution by comparing models that predict extreme
and central outcomes in an airline fuel usage case study. We conclude that SQR
is suitable for predicting conditional quantiles and understanding interesting
feature influences at varying quantiles.

TL;DR: 论文比较了三种算子学习替代模型（DeepONet、FNO和PE-FNO）用于锂离子电池单粒子模型，PE-FNO在动态负载和参数泛化方面表现最佳，速度快且精度高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为满足锂离子电池数字孪生对高物理保真度和亚毫秒速度的需求，研究高效的算子学习替代模型。

Method: 训练三种模型（DeepONet、FNO、PE-FNO）于多种电流负载和SOC范围的模拟数据，评估其性能。

Result: PE-FNO在动态负载下保持低误差，速度快200倍，并在参数估计任务中表现优于传统方法。

Conclusion: PE-FNO为实时电池管理和高保真电化学数字孪生提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Reliable digital twins of lithium-ion batteries must achieve high physical
fidelity with sub-millisecond speed. In this work, we benchmark three
operator-learning surrogates for the Single Particle Model (SPM): Deep Operator
Networks (DeepONets), Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) and a newly proposed
parameter-embedded Fourier Neural Operator (PE-FNO), which conditions each
spectral layer on particle radius and solid-phase diffusivity. Models are
trained on simulated trajectories spanning four current families (constant,
triangular, pulse-train, and Gaussian-random-field) and a full range of
State-of-Charge (SOC) (0 % to 100 %). DeepONet accurately replicates
constant-current behaviour but struggles with more dynamic loads. The basic FNO
maintains mesh invariance and keeps concentration errors below 1 %, with
voltage mean-absolute errors under 1.7 mV across all load types. Introducing
parameter embedding marginally increases error, but enables generalisation to
varying radii and diffusivities. PE-FNO executes approximately 200 times faster
than a 16-thread SPM solver. Consequently, PE-FNO's capabilities in inverse
tasks are explored in a parameter estimation task with Bayesian optimisation,
recovering anode and cathode diffusivities with 1.14 % and 8.4 % mean absolute
percentage error, respectively, and 0.5918 percentage points higher error in
comparison with classical methods. These results pave the way for neural
operators to meet the accuracy, speed and parametric flexibility demands of
real-time battery management, design-of-experiments and large-scale inference.
PE-FNO outperforms conventional neural surrogates, offering a practical path
towards high-speed and high-fidelity electrochemical digital twins.

Conclusion: Grid2Guide是一种轻量级、无需基础设施的实时室内导航解决方案。

Abstract: Reliable indoor navigation remains a significant challenge in complex
environments, particularly where external positioning signals and dedicated
infrastructures are unavailable. This research presents Grid2Guide, a hybrid
navigation framework that combines the A* search algorithm with a Small
Language Model (SLM) to generate clear, human-readable route instructions. The
framework first conducts a binary occupancy matrix from a given indoor map.
Using this matrix, the A* algorithm computes the optimal path between origin
and destination, producing concise textual navigation steps. These steps are
then transformed into natural language instructions by the SLM, enhancing
interpretability for end users. Experimental evaluations across various indoor
scenarios demonstrate the method's effectiveness in producing accurate and
timely navigation guidance. The results validate the proposed approach as a
lightweight, infrastructure-free solution for real-time indoor navigation
support.

Abstract: Indoor navigation remains a complex challenge due to the absence of reliable
GPS signals and the architectural intricacies of large enclosed environments.
This study presents an indoor localization and navigation approach that
integrates vision-based localization with large language model (LLM)-based
navigation. The localization system utilizes a ResNet-50 convolutional neural
network fine-tuned through a two-stage process to identify the user's position
using smartphone camera input. To complement localization, the navigation
module employs an LLM, guided by a carefully crafted system prompt, to
interpret preprocessed floor plan images and generate step-by-step directions.
Experimental evaluation was conducted in a realistic office corridor with
repetitive features and limited visibility to test localization robustness. The
model achieved high confidence and an accuracy of 96% across all tested
waypoints, even under constrained viewing conditions and short-duration
queries. Navigation tests using ChatGPT on real building floor maps yielded an
average instruction accuracy of 75%, with observed limitations in zero-shot
reasoning and inference time. This research demonstrates the potential for
scalable, infrastructure-free indoor navigation using off-the-shelf cameras and
publicly available floor plans, particularly in resource-constrained settings
like hospitals, airports, and educational institutions.

Conclusion: memoryKT模型通过完整记忆周期建模和个性化遗忘机制，有效提升知识追踪的感知能力和性能。

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) is committed to capturing students' knowledge mastery
from their historical interactions. Simulating students' memory states is a
promising approach to enhance both the performance and interpretability of
knowledge tracing models. Memory consists of three fundamental processes:
encoding, storage, and retrieval. Although forgetting primarily manifests
during the storage stage, most existing studies rely on a single,
undifferentiated forgetting mechanism, overlooking other memory processes as
well as personalized forgetting patterns. To address this, this paper proposes
memoryKT, a knowledge tracing model based on a novel temporal variational
autoencoder. The model simulates memory dynamics through a three-stage process:
(i) Learning the distribution of students' knowledge memory features, (ii)
Reconstructing their exercise feedback, while (iii) Embedding a personalized
forgetting module within the temporal workflow to dynamically modulate memory
storage strength. This jointly models the complete encoding-storage-retrieval
cycle, significantly enhancing the model's perception capability for individual
differences. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that our
proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: NeuroDx-LM展示了EEG大规模模型在临床中的广阔应用前景。

Abstract: Large-scale models pre-trained on Electroencephalography (EEG) have shown
promise in clinical applications such as neurological disorder detection.
However, the practical deployment of EEG-based large-scale models faces
critical challenges such as limited labeled EEG data and suboptimal performance
in clinical scenarios. To address these issues, we propose NeuroDx-LM, a novel
large-scale model specifically designed for detecting EEG-based neurological
disorders. Our key contributions include (i) a Selective Temporal-Frequency
Embedding mechanism that adaptively captures complex temporal and spectral
patterns in EEG signals; and (ii) a Progressive Feature-Aware Training strategy
that refines feature representation in a two-stage process. In the first stage,
our model learns the fundamental discriminative features of EEG activities; in
the second stage, the model further extracts more specialized fine-grained
features for accurate diagnostic performance. We evaluated NeuroDx-LM on the
CHB-MIT and Schizophrenia datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in
EEG-based seizure and schizophrenia detection, respectively. These results
demonstrate the great potential of EEG-based large-scale models to advance
clinical applicability. Our code is available at

Result: OFAL能够生成信息丰富的不确定样本，提升主动学习效果和模型准确性。

Conclusion: OFAL为主动学习提供了一种高效且无需标注者的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In the active learning paradigm, using an oracle to label data has always
been a complex and expensive task, and with the emersion of large unlabeled
data pools, it would be highly beneficial If we could achieve better results
without relying on an oracle. This research introduces OFAL, an oracle-free
active learning scheme that utilizes neural network uncertainty. OFAL uses the
model's own uncertainty to transform highly confident unlabeled samples into
informative uncertain samples. First, we start with separating and quantifying
different parts of uncertainty and introduce Monte Carlo Dropouts as an
approximation of the Bayesian Neural Network model. Secondly, by adding a
variational autoencoder, we go on to generate new uncertain samples by stepping
toward the uncertain part of latent space starting from a confidence seed
sample. By generating these new informative samples, we can perform active
learning and enhance the model's accuracy. Lastly, we try to compare and
integrate our method with other widely used active learning sampling methods.

Method: MuaLLM采用Reason + Act（ReAct）工作流，结合多模态数据处理和动态检索工具，实现高效信息检索和推理。

Result: MuaLLM在RAG-250和Reas-100数据集上分别达到90.1%召回率和86.8%准确率，且成本更低、速度更快。

Conclusion: MuaLLM通过解耦检索与推理，克服了传统方法的局限性，为电路设计提供了高效、可扩展的辅助工具。

Abstract: Conducting a comprehensive literature review is crucial for advancing circuit
design methodologies. However, the rapid influx of state-of-the-art research,
inconsistent data representation, and the complexity of optimizing circuit
design objectives make this task significantly challenging. In this paper, we
propose MuaLLM, an open-source multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) agent for
circuit design assistance that integrates a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) framework with an adaptive vector database of circuit design
research papers. Unlike conventional LLMs, the MuaLLM agent employs a Reason +
Act (ReAct) workflow for iterative reasoning, goal-setting, and multi-step
information retrieval. It functions as a question-answering design assistant,
capable of interpreting complex queries and providing reasoned responses
grounded in circuit literature. Its multimodal capabilities enable processing
of both textual and visual data, facilitating more efficient and comprehensive
analysis. The system dynamically adapts using intelligent search tools,
automated document retrieval from the internet, and real-time database updates.
Unlike conventional approaches constrained by model context limits, MuaLLM
decouples retrieval from inference, enabling scalable reasoning over
arbitrarily large corpora. At the maximum context length supported by standard
LLMs, MuaLLM remains up to 10x less costly and 1.6x faster while maintaining
the same accuracy. This allows rapid, no-human-in-the-loop database generation,
overcoming the bottleneck of simulation-based dataset creation for circuits. To
evaluate MuaLLM, we introduce two custom datasets: RAG-250, targeting retrieval
and citation performance, and Reasoning-100 (Reas-100), focused on multistep
reasoning in circuit design. MuaLLM achieves 90.1% recall on RAG-250, and 86.8%
accuracy on Reas-100.

Result: 在多个数据集和DNN模型上，FairFLRep在提升公平性和效率方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FairFLRep在故障定位和修复阶段均需考虑公平性，且比基线方法更高效。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are being utilized in various aspects of our
daily lives, including high-stakes decision-making applications that impact
individuals. However, these systems reflect and amplify bias from the data used
during training and testing, potentially resulting in biased behavior and
inaccurate decisions. For instance, having different misclassification rates
between white and black sub-populations. However, effectively and efficiently
identifying and correcting biased behavior in DNNs is a challenge. This paper
introduces FairFLRep, an automated fairness-aware fault localization and repair
technique that identifies and corrects potentially bias-inducing neurons in DNN
classifiers. FairFLRep focuses on adjusting neuron weights associated with
sensitive attributes, such as race or gender, that contribute to unfair
decisions. By analyzing the input-output relationships within the network,
FairFLRep corrects neurons responsible for disparities in predictive quality
parity. We evaluate FairFLRep on four image classification datasets using two
DNN classifiers, and four tabular datasets with a DNN model. The results show
that FairFLRep consistently outperforms existing methods in improving fairness
while preserving accuracy. An ablation study confirms the importance of
considering fairness during both fault localization and repair stages. Our
findings also show that FairFLRep is more efficient than the baseline
approaches in repairing the network.

Motivation: 由于患者隐私法规和数据异质性（非独立同分布特性），开发跨多个临床站点的癫痫发作预测模型面临挑战。联邦学习提供了一种隐私保护的协作训练框架，但标准聚合方法（如FedAvg）在异质环境中可能受主导数据集影响。

Method: 论文采用单通道EEG数据，提出隐私保护的全局归一化和随机子集聚合策略，确保每个客户端在每轮训练中贡献均衡。

Result: 结果显示，标准加权FedAvg在异质数据上表现不均（如CHB-MIT准确率89.0%，Helsinki和NCH仅50%左右），而随机子集聚合显著提升了弱势客户端的性能（Helsinki准确率提升至81.7%，NCH至68.7%），全局宏平均准确率达77.1%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，平衡的联邦学习方法在保护隐私的同时，能够在异质多医院环境中构建更鲁棒且公平的癫痫发作预测系统。

Abstract: Developing accurate and generalizable epileptic seizure prediction models
from electroencephalography (EEG) data across multiple clinical sites is
hindered by patient privacy regulations and significant data heterogeneity
(non-IID characteristics). Federated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving
framework for collaborative training, but standard aggregation methods like
Federated Averaging (FedAvg) can be biased by dominant datasets in
heterogeneous settings. This paper investigates FL for seizure prediction using
a single EEG channel across four diverse public datasets (Siena, CHB-MIT,
Helsinki, NCH), representing distinct patient populations (adult, pediatric,
neonate) and recording conditions. We implement privacy-preserving global
normalization and propose a Random Subset Aggregation strategy, where each
client trains on a fixed-size random subset of its data per round, ensuring
equal contribution during aggregation. Our results show that locally trained
models fail to generalize across sites, and standard weighted FedAvg yields
highly skewed performance (e.g., 89.0% accuracy on CHB-MIT but only 50.8% on
Helsinki and 50.6% on NCH). In contrast, Random Subset Aggregation
significantly improves performance on under-represented clients (accuracy
increases to 81.7% on Helsinki and 68.7% on NCH) and achieves a superior
macro-average accuracy of 77.1% and pooled accuracy of 80.0% across all sites,
demonstrating a more robust and fair global model. This work highlights the
potential of balanced FL approaches for building effective and generalizable
seizure prediction systems in realistic, heterogeneous multi-hospital
environments while respecting data privacy.

Abstract: Traditional neural networks have an impressive classification performance,
but what they learn cannot be inspected, verified or extracted. Neural Logic
Networks on the other hand have an interpretable structure that enables them to
learn a logical mechanism relating the inputs and outputs with AND and OR
operations. We generalize these networks with NOT operations and biases that
take into account unobserved data and develop a rigorous logical and
probabilistic modeling in terms of concept combinations to motivate their use.
We also propose a novel factorized IF-THEN rule structure for the model as well
as a modified learning algorithm. Our method improves the state-of-the-art in
Boolean networks discovery and is able to learn relevant, interpretable rules
in tabular classification, notably on an example from the medical field where
interpretability has tangible value.

Abstract: Personalised music-based interventions offer a powerful means of supporting
motor rehabilitation by dynamically tailoring auditory stimuli to provide
external timekeeping cues, modulate affective states, and stabilise gait
patterns. Generalisable Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) thus hold promise for
adapting these interventions across individuals. However, inter-subject
variability in EEG signals, further compounded by movement-induced artefacts
and motor planning differences, hinders the generalisability of BCIs and
results in lengthy calibration processes. We propose Individual Tangent Space
Alignment (ITSA), a novel pre-alignment strategy incorporating subject-specific
recentering, distribution matching, and supervised rotational alignment to
enhance cross-subject generalisation. Our hybrid architecture fuses Regularised
Common Spatial Patterns (RCSP) with Riemannian geometry in parallel and
sequential configurations, improving class separability while maintaining the
geometric structure of covariance matrices for robust statistical computation.
Using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, `ITSA' demonstrates significant
performance improvements across subjects and conditions. The parallel fusion
approach shows the greatest enhancement over its sequential counterpart, with
robust performance maintained across varying data conditions and electrode
configurations. The code will be made publicly available at the time of
publication.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in multi-step
reasoning tasks. However, understandings of the underlying mechanisms by which
they acquire these abilities through training remain limited, particularly from
a theoretical standpoint. This work investigates how transformers learn to
solve symbolic multi-step reasoning problems through chain-of-thought
processes, focusing on path-finding in trees. We analyze two intertwined tasks:
a backward reasoning task, where the model outputs a path from a goal node to
the root, and a more complex forward reasoning task, where the model implements
two-stage reasoning by first identifying the goal-to-root path and then
reversing it to produce the root-to-goal path. Our theoretical analysis,
grounded in the dynamics of gradient descent, shows that trained one-layer
transformers can provably solve both tasks with generalization guarantees to
unseen trees. In particular, our multi-phase training dynamics for forward
reasoning elucidate how different attention heads learn to specialize and
coordinate autonomously to solve the two subtasks in a single autoregressive
path. These results provide a mechanistic explanation of how trained
transformers can implement sequential algorithmic procedures. Moreover, they
offer insights into the emergence of reasoning abilities, suggesting that when
tasks are structured to take intermediate chain-of-thought steps, even shallow
multi-head transformers can effectively solve problems that would otherwise
require deeper architectures.

Abstract: We present an operator learning approach for a class of evolution operators
using a composition of a learned lift into the space of diffeomorphisms of the
domain and the group action on the field space. In turn, this transforms the
semigroup structure of the evolution operator into a corresponding group
structure allowing time stepping be performed through composition on the space
of diffeomorphisms rather than in the field space directly. This results in a
number of structure-preserving properties related to preserving a relabelling
symmetry of the dynamics as a hard constraint. We study the resolution
properties of our approach, along with its connection to the techniques of
diffeomorphic image registration. Numerical experiments on forecasting
turbulent fluid dynamics are provided, demonstrating its conservative
properties, non-diffusivity, and ability to capture anticipated statistical
scaling relations at sub-grid scales. Our method provides an example of
geometric operator learning and indicates a clear performance benefit from
leveraging a priori known infinite-dimensional geometric structure.

gradient, the curl, and the divergence operators, over domains with shellable
triangulations. Notably, the class of shellable triangulations includes local
patches (stars) in two or three dimensions. The operator norms of our
potentials satisfy explicitly computable bounds that depend only on the
geometry. We thus compute upper bounds for constants in Poincar\'e--Friedrichs
inequalities and lower bounds for the eigenvalues of vector Laplacians. As an
additional result with independent standing, we establish
Poincar\'e--Friedrichs inequalities with computable constants for the $L^{p}$
de~Rham complex over bounded convex domains, derived as explicit operator norms
of regularized Poincar\'e and Bogovski\u{\i} potential operators. We express
all our main results in the calculus of differential forms and treat the
gradient, curl, and divergence operators as instances of the exterior
derivative. Computational examples illustrate the theoretical findings.

### [479] [Modified Cubic B-spline Based Differential Quadrature Methods for Time-fractional Black-Scholes Equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06780)

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于改进三次B样条的微分求积法（DQM）来高效求解时间分数阶Black-Scholes方程（TFBSE），用于欧式期权定价。方法结合了时间分数阶离散化和空间离散化，理论稳定性得到验证，数值结果显示高精度和收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TFBSE用于描述具有长期记忆特性的金融市场，但其非局部性导致求解困难。本文旨在开发一种高效且精确的数值方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 结合有限差分法（L1）进行时间分数阶离散化，以及基于改进三次B样条的DQM进行空间离散化，采用均匀网格。理论稳定性通过逆算子范数估计和Neumann级数定理验证。

Result: 数值方法在空间方向呈现四阶收敛，时间方向为$2-\alpha$阶收敛，且当$\alpha$趋近于0时空间收敛阶数提升。与现有方法相比，精度更高。

Conclusion: 改进的DQM方法在求解TFBSE时表现出高效性和高精度，适用于金融市场的长期记忆特性建模。

Abstract: The time-fractional Black-Scholes equation (TFBSE) is intended to price the
options for which the underlying price fluctuates within a correlated fractal
transmission system. Although the TFBSE is an influential approach for grasping
the long-term memory traits of financial markets, the non-local nature of
fractional derivatives makes significant challenges in finding an accurate
solution. We perform an efficient use of the differential quadrature method
(DQM) based on modified cubic B-splines to solve the TFBSE governing European
options. This paper constructs an algorithm by the combination of time
fractional discretization using the finite difference method $L1$ and space
discretization using the modified cubic B-spline-based differential quadrature
method. Uniform meshes are considered for the discretization of both temporal
and spatial domains. Theoretical stability has been established by finding an
estimate for the maximum norm of the inverse operator regardless of the
involvement of mesh parameters. We trigger the Neumann series theorem to obtain
a uniform bound for the inverse operator under reasonable conditions on the
mesh parameters. The numerical illustrations show that this implicit numerical
method exhibits a fourth-order convergence in the space direction and the order
$2-\alpha$ in time. Moreover, we observe an enhancement in order of spatial
convergence whenever $\alpha$ tends to $0$. The results obtained are then
compared with existing popular techniques to demonstrate the accuracy of
modified cubic B-spline-based DQM.

Result: 渐近分析表明原始模型可完全恢复，数值验证显示扩展模型准确且鲁棒。

Conclusion: OPBDE方法能有效处理任意几何域中的梯度流问题。

Abstract: The original Cahn-Hilliard model in an arbitrary domain with two prescribed
boundary conditions is extended to a Cahn-Hilliard-type model in a larger,
regular domain with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. The extension is
based on the Onsager principle-based domain embedding (OPBDE) method, which has
been developed as a systematic domain embedding framework to ensure
thermodynamic consistency. By introducing a modified conservation law, the flux
at the boundary of the original domain is incorporated into the conservation
law as a source term. Our variational approach demonstrates that, even without
a prior knowledge on the specific form of the rate of free energy pumped into
the system, the Onsager principle remains an effective instrument in deriving
the constitutive equation of the extended system. This approach clarifies the
intrinsic structure of the extended model in the perspectives of free energy
and its dissipation. Asymptotic analysis is carried out for the extended OPBDE
Cahn-Hilliard model, demonstrating that the original Cahn-Hilliard model,
including its boundary conditions, can be fully recovered. To validate our
approach, a structure-preserving numerical scheme is developed to discretize
the extended model. Numerical results show that the OPBDE Cahn-Hilliard model
is accurate, effective, and robust, highlighting the capability of the OPBDE
method in handling gradient flow problems in arbitrary domain geometries.

Conclusion: 线性化求解器结合自适应容差为随机Stefan问题提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: We present iterative solvers to approximate the solution of numerical schemes
for stochastic Stefan problems. After briefly talking about the convergence
results, we tackle the question of efficient strategies for solving the
nonlinear equation associated with this scheme. We explore several approaches,
from a standard Newton technique to linearised solvers. The latter offer the
advantage of using the same coefficient matrix of the linearised system in each
nonlinear iteration, for all time steps, and across all realisations of the
Brownian motions. As a consequence, the system can be factorised once and for
all. Although the linearised approach has a slower convergence rate, our
sensitivity analysis and the use of adaptive tolerance in both deterministic
and stochastic cases provide valuable insights for choosing the most effective
solver across various scenarii.

Result: 数值实验验证了方法的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法在积分测量场景下能有效重构高次多项式，并通过富集策略确保单值性。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce new families of nonconforming approximation
methods for reconstructing functions on general polygonal meshes. These methods
are defined using degrees of freedom based on weighted moments of orthogonal
polynomials and can reproduce higher-degree polynomials. This setting naturally
arises in applications where pointwise evaluations are unavailable and only
integral measurements over subdomains are accessible. We develop a unisolvence
theory and derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the associated
approximation spaces to be unisolvent. Specifically, it is shown that
unisolvence depends on the parity of the product of the polynomial degree~$m$
and the number of polygon edges~$N$. When this condition is not satisfied, we
introduce an enrichment strategy involving an additional linear functional and
a suitably designed enrichment function to ensure unisolvence. Numerical
experiments confirm the accuracy of the proposed method.

Abstract: The interpolation-regression approximation is a powerful tool in numerical
analysis for reconstructing functions defined on square or triangular domains
from their evaluations at a regular set of nodes. The importance of this
technique lies in its ability to avoid the Runge phenomenon. In this paper, we
present a polynomial approximation method based on an interpolation-regression
approach for reconstructing functions defined on disk domains from their
evaluations at a general set of sampling points. Special attention is devoted
to the selection of interpolation nodes to ensure numerical stability,
particularly in the context of Zernike polynomials. As an application, the
proposed method is used to derive accurate cubature formulas for numerical
integration over the disk.

Conclusion: 本文方法为直方图插值提供了一种更灵活且高效的解决方案，适用于有界可积函数的逼近。

Abstract: Histopolation, or interpolation on segments, is a mathematical technique used
to approximate a function $f$ over a given interval $I=[a,b]$ by exploiting
integral information over a set of subintervals of $I$. Unlike classical
polynomial interpolation, which is based on pointwise function evaluations,
histopolation reconstructs a function using integral data. However, similar to
classical polynomial interpolation, histopolation suffers from the well-known
Runge phenomenon when integral data are based on a grid with many equispaced
nodes, as well as the Gibbs phenomenon when approximating discontinuous
functions. In contrast, quasi-histopolation is designed to relax the strict
requirement of passing through all the given data points. This inherent
flexibility can reduce the likelihood of oscillatory behavior using, for
example, rational approximation operators. In this work, we introduce a
$C^{\infty}$ rational quasi-histopolation operator, for bounded (integrable)
functions, which reconstruct a function by defeating both the Runge and Gibbs
phenomena. A key element of our approach is to blend local histopolation
polynomials on a few nodes using multinode Shepard functions as blending
functions. Several numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy of our
method.

Abstract: A finite element framework is presented for the analysis of crack-tip
phenomena in an elastic material containing a single edge crack under
compressive loading. The mechanical response of the material is modeled by a
nonlinear constitutive relationship that algebraically relates stress to
linearized strain. This approach serves to mitigate non-physical strain
singularities and ensures that the crack-tip strains don't grow, unlike
singular stresses. A significant advancement is thus achieved in the
formulation of boundary value problems (BVPs) for such complex scenarios. The
governing equilibrium equation, derived from the balance of linear momentum and
the nonlinear constitutive model, is formulated as a second-order,
vector-valued, quasilinear elliptic BVP. A classical traction-free boundary
condition is imposed on the crack face. The problem is solved using a robust
numerical scheme in which a Picard-type linearization is combined with a
continuous Galerkin finite element method for the discretization. Analyses are
performed for both an isotropic and a transversely isotropic elastic solid
containing a crack subjected to compressive loads. The primary crack-tip
variables**-stress, strain, and strain energy density-**are examined in detail.
It is demonstrated that while high concentrations of compressive stress and
strain energy density are observed at the crack tip, the growth of strain is
substantially lower than that of stress. These findings are shown to be
consistent with the predictions of linear elastic fracture mechanics, but a
more physically meaningful representation of the crack-tip field is provided by
the nonlinear approach. A rigorous basis is thus established for investigating
fundamental processes like crack propagation and damage in anisotropic,
strain-limiting solids under various loading conditions, including compression.

Conclusion: 修正L-方案和自适应M-方案比牛顿法更稳定且收敛更快，自适应M-方案表现最优。

Abstract: We consider linear iterative schemes for the time-discrete equations stemming
from a class of nonlinear, doubly-degenerate parabolic equations. More
precisely, the diffusion is nonlinear and may vanish or become multivalued for
certain values of the unknown, so the parabolic equation becomes hyperbolic or
elliptic, respectively. After performing an Euler implicit time-stepping, a
splitting strategy is applied to the time-discrete equations. This leads to a
formulation that is more suitable for dealing with the degeneracies. Based on
this splitting, different iterative linearization strategies are considered,
namely the Newton scheme, the L-scheme, and the modified L-scheme. We prove the
convergence of the latter two schemes even for the double-degenerate case. In
the non-degenerate case, we prove that the scheme is contractive, and the
contraction rate is proportional to a non-negative exponent of the time-step
size. Moreover, an a posteriori estimator-based adaptive algorithm is developed
to select the optimal parameters for the M-scheme, which accelerates its
convergence. Numerical results are presented, showing that the M- and the
M-adaptive schemes are more stable than the Newton scheme, as they converge
irrespective of the mesh. Moreover, the adaptive M-scheme consistently
out-competes not only the M/L-schemes, but also the Newton scheme showing
quadratic convergence behavior.

Abstract: The study of quasi-interpolation has gained significant importance in
numerical analysis and approximation theory due to its versatile applications
in scientific and engineering fields. This technique provides a flexible and
efficient alternative to traditional interpolation methods by approximating
data points without requiring the approximated function to pass exactly through
them. This approach is particularly valuable for handling jump discontinuities,
where classical interpolation methods often fail due to the Gibbs phenomenon.
These discontinuities are common in practical scenarios such as signal

rational quasi-interpolation operator designed to effectively approximate
functions with jump discontinuities while minimizing the issues typically
associated with traditional interpolation methods.

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了PINN误差估计的适用性和实用性。

Abstract: Rigorous error estimation is a fundamental topic in numerical analysis. With
the increasing use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for solving
partial differential equations, several approaches have been developed to
quantify the associated prediction error. In this work, we build upon a
semigroup-based framework previously introduced by the authors for estimating
the PINN error. While this estimator has so far been limited to academic
examples - due to the need to compute quantities related to input-to-state
stability - we extend its applicability to a significantly broader class of
problems. This is accomplished by modifying the error bound and proposing
numerical strategies to approximate the required stability parameters. The
extended framework enables the certification of PINN predictions in more
realistic scenarios, as demonstrated by a numerical study of Stokes flow around
a cylinder.

on $|\lambda_i - \wtd \lambda_i|$:
  $|\lambda_i- \wtd \lambda_i| \le \|E\|$, where $\|E\|$
  is the largest singular value of $\|E\|$, regardless of
  $H_i$'s spectral distributions, and
  $|\lambda_i - \wtd \lambda_i| \le \|E\|^2/\eta$, where $\eta$ is
  the minimum gap between $H_i$'s spectra. \end{enumerate} Bounds of the first
kind overestimate the changes when $\|E\|\ll\eta$ while those of the second
kind may blow up when $\eta$ is too tiny. \fi Denote by $\|E\|$ the spectral
norm of the matrix $E$, and $\eta$ the spectral gap between the spectra of

Abstract: A comprehensive convergence and stability analysis of some probabilistic
numerical methods designed to solve Cauchy-type inverse problems is performed
in this study. Such inverse problems aim at solving an elliptic partial
differential equation (PDE) or a system of elliptic PDEs in a bounded Euclidean
domain, subject to incomplete boundary and/or internal conditions, and are
usually severely ill-posed. In a very recent paper \cite{CiGrMaI}, a
probabilistic numerical framework has been developed by the authors, wherein
such inverse problems could be analysed thoroughly by simulating the spectrum
of some corresponding direct problem and its singular value decomposition based
on stochastic representations and Monte Carlo simulations. Herein a full
probabilistic error analysis of the aforementioned methods is provided, whereas
the convergence of the corresponding approximations is proved and explicit
error bounds are provided. This is achieved by employing tools from several
areas such as spectral theory, regularity theory for elliptic measures,
stochastic representations, and concentration inequalities.

Abstract: We investigate how turbulence is reshaped by the presence of externally
forced light particles, using high-resolution direct numerical simulations with
four-way coupling. The particles are subject to an oscillatory force that in
turn locally affects the fluid flow through momentum exchange at the position
of the particles. Since the light particles preferentially concentrate in high
vorticity regions, this leads to an intricate preferential turbulence
modulation. We show that through this modulation, the forced light particles
strongly reduce the intermittency of the flow, shedding new light on the
delicate relationship between vortex filaments and turbulence intermittency.

Abstract: Numerical turbulence simulations typically involve parameterizations such as
Large Eddy Simulations (LES). Applications to geophysical flows, especially
ocean flows, are further complicated by the presence of complex topography and
interior landforms such as coastlines, islands, and capes. In this work, we
extend pseudo-spectral quasi-geostrophic (QG) numerical schemes and GPU-based
solvers to simulate flows with coastal boundaries using the Brinkman volume
penalization approach. We incorporate sponging and a splitting scheme to handle
inflow and aperiodic boundary conditions. We evaluate four analytical
sub-grid-scale (SGS) closures based on the eddy viscosity hypothesis: the
standard Smagorinsky and Leith closures, and their dynamic variants. We show
applications to QG flows past circular islands and capes with the beta-plane
approximation. We perform both a priori analysis of the SGS closure terms as
well as a posteriori assessment of the SGS terms and simulated vorticity
fields. Our results showcase differences between the various closures,
especially their approach to phase and feature reconstruction errors in the
presence of coastal boundaries.

Conclusion: 该方法通过SpMM和网格细化的结合，显著提升了CFD模拟的性能和效率。

Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are often constrained by the
memory-bound nature of sparse matrix-vector operations, which eventually limits
performance on modern high-performance computing (HPC) systems. This work
introduces a novel approach to increase arithmetic intensity in CFD by
leveraging repeated matrix block structures. The method transforms the
conventional sparse matrix-vector product (SpMV) into a sparse matrix-matrix
product (SpMM), enabling simultaneous processing of multiple right-hand sides.
This shifts the computation towards a more compute-bound regime by reusing
matrix coefficients. Additionally, an inline mesh-refinement strategy is
proposed: simulations initially run on a coarse mesh to establish a
statistically steady flow, then refine to the target mesh. This reduces the
wall-clock time to reach transition, leading to faster convergence with
equivalent computational cost. The methodology is evaluated using theoretical
performance bounds and validated through three test cases: a turbulent channel
flow, Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection, and an industrial airfoil simulation.
Results demonstrate substantial speed-ups - from modest improvements in basic
configurations to over 50% in the mesh-refinement setup - highlighting the
benefits of integrating SpMM across all CFD operators, including divergence,
gradient, and Laplacian.

Result: 增加剪切幅度或速度可延迟不稳定性发生并降低指进生长速率。

Conclusion: 剪切力可用于稳定混溶流体对，防止指进现象，粘度分布平滑与不稳定性延迟直接相关。

Abstract: We introduce applied shear as a method to control viscous fingering by
smoothing the interface between miscible fluids. In the viscous fingering
instability, a less viscous fluid displaces a more viscous one through the
formation of fingers. The instability, which requires a confined geometry, is
often studied in the thin gap of a quasi-two-dimensional Hele-Shaw cell. When
the two fluids are miscible, the structures that form in the dimension
traversing the gap are important for determining the instability onset. We
demonstrate with experiments and simulations that oscillatory translational
shear of the confining plates changes the gap-averaged viscosity profile so
that it becomes less abrupt at the finger tips. Increasing the amplitude or
velocity of the shear delays the instability onset and decreases the finger
growth rate. Shear can thus be used to stabilize a pair of miscible fluids
against fingering. The results show a direct correlation between a smoother
viscosity profile and delayed instability.
  TEASER: Oscillatory shear smooths fluid interfaces, stabilizing viscous
fingering in miscible fluids.

Abstract: This work presents the Lagrangian entropic lattice Boltzmann method (LELBM),
a novel framework for supersonic lattice Boltzmann method that surpasses
traditional restrictions on velocity, temperature, viscosity, and memory,
resulting in stable and efficient Courant-free LBM formulation, while still
maintaining explicit time stepping. A regularized central moment collision
method coupled with a double-distribution function (DDF) that considers
internal degrees of freedom enabled the precise control of shear viscosity,
bulk viscosity, and thermal conductivity. Lagrangian acoustic stencils (LAS), a
generalized multispeed shifted lattice construction method, is introduced to
adapt to arbitrary local velocity and temperature. Additionally, entropic
population reconstruction (EPR) has been used to obtain entropy-satisfying
post-collision population while achieving both positivity and conservation of
moments. Memory requirements are drastically reduced from a polynomial order of
temperature to a constant by employing moment streaming (MS) algorithm. The
unified LELBM framework is validated through comprehensive benchmark problems.
In one dimension, the model is evaluated through Sod's shock tube, Lax problem,
and Shu-Osher wave. In two dimensions, 2D Riemann problem, double Mach
reflection, oblique shock, supersonic flow past a circular cylinder, and
supersonic flow past a NACA0012 airfoil have been tested to assess the
robustness and accuracy of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of nonequilibrium gas flows spanning multiple flow
regimes is challenging due to the breakdown of scale separation. In this work,
we propose a kinetic framework that captures the transport of molecules under
varying collision behaviors within a given observation timescale $h$. Within
this framework, gas molecules in the system are classified into three types
over the time interval $0\le t<h$, namely, collided molecules that have
experienced collisions with other molecules, free-transport molecules that
encounter no collisions during $[0,h]$, and transitional molecules which
encounter no collisions during $[0, t]$ but collide with other molecules during
$[t,h]$. Then three coupled sub-kinetic equations for different types of
molecules are developed rigorously through the formal solution of the Boltzmann
equation. The asymptotic behaviors of the three sub-kinetic equations are
analyzed, and it is shown that the system presents a framework for describing
the exchange among the molecules with different collision behaviors. Beyond
enabling variable-scale kinetic modeling, this framework can provide a basis
for developing efficient numerical methods for simulating multiscale gas flows.
Importantly, due to its intrinstic mutiscale nature, the proposed framework may
also offer new insights into Hillbert's sixth problem.

Abstract: The surface tension of a liquid, which drives most free surface flows at
small scales, is often measured with the pendant drop method due to its
simplicity and reliability. When the drop is suspended in air, controlling the
ambient temperature and humidity is usually an afterthought, resulting in
evaporation of the drop during the measurement. Here, we investigate the effect
of evaporation on the measured surface tension using experiments and numerical
simulations. In the experiments, we measured the evolution of the droplet
temperature, which can drastically reduce by ($\Delta T \approx 10 \degC$) due
to evaporative cooling, and thereby altering the measured surface tension by
more than 1 mN/m. This finding can be reproduced by numerical simulations,
which additionally allows for controlled investigations of the individual
influences of further effects on the pendant drop method, namely shape
deformations by evaporation-driven flows in the gas-phase and in the
liquid-phase including the resulting Marangoni flow. We provide a simple
passive method to control the relative humidity without requiring additional
instrumentation. Our findings are particularly pertinent to Marangoni flows
which are driven by surface tension gradients, and which are consequently
highly sensitive to measurement inaccuracies. We apply our method with
different aqueous mixtures of glycerol and various diols. Our results and
insights have implications for various applications, ranging from inkjet
printing to agricultural sprays. Finally, we have meticulously documented our
setup and procedure for future reference.

Abstract: We consider shear-driven longitudinal flow of an exterior fluid over a
periodic array of rectangular grooves filled with an immiscible interior fluid
(the "lubricant"), the grooves being formed by infinitely thin ridges
protruding from a flat substrate. The ratio $\lambda$ of the effective slip
length to the semi-period is a function of the ratio $\mu$ of the interior to
exterior viscosities and the ratio $h$ of the grooves depth to the semi-period.
We focus on the limit $\mu\ll1$, which is singular for that geometry. We find
that the viscous resistance to the imposed shear is dominated by a boundary
layer of exponentially small extent about the ridge tips, resulting in the
effective slip length scaling as $\mu^{-1/2}$ - not $\mu^{-1}$ as implied by
intuitive arguments overlooking the tip contributions (and by proposed
approximations in the literature). Analyzing that exponential region in
conjunction with an integral force balance, we find the simple asymptotic
approximation $\lambda\approx \mu^{-1/2}$; using conformal mappings, we also
calculate the leading-order correction to that result, which introduces a
dependence upon $h$. The ensuing asymptotic expansion breaks down for
$h=O(\mu^{1/2})$, upon transitioning to a lubrication geometry. We accordingly
conduct a companion asymptotic analysis in the distinguished limit of small
$\mu$ and fixed $H=h/\mu^{1/2}$, which gives $\lambda\approx \mu^{-1/2}H/(1+H)$
as well as a closed-form leading-order correction to that approximation; the
intuitive $\mu^{-1}$ scaling is accordingly only relevant to the regime $H\ll1$
corresponding to extremely shallow grooves. We demonstrate excellent agreement
between our predictions and numerical solutions constructed using a
boundary-integral formulation.

Abstract: Underwater explosion modeling faces a critical challenge of simultaneously
resolving shock waves and gas-liquid interfaces, as traditional methods
struggle to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. To address this, we
develop a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework featuring a
dual-network architecture, that one network learns flow-field variables
(pressure, density, velocity) from simulation data, while another network
tracks the gas-liquid interface despite lacking direct numerical solutions.
Crucially, we introduce an interval-constraint training strategy that penalizes
interface deviations beyond grid spacing limits, paired with a
physics-preserving linear mapping of 1D spherical Euler equations to ensure
consistency. Our results show that this approach accurately reconstructs
spatiotemporal fields from coarse-grid data, achieving superior computational
efficiency over conventional CFD-enabling rapid, mesh-free blast-load analysis
for near/far-field scenarios and extensibility to higher-dimensional problems.

Result: 数值测试验证了方法的准确性和效率，例如在500步内收敛500万网格单元的3D翼身流动。

Conclusion: 本文展示了GKS在高雷诺数内外湍流流动中与传统CFD方法竞争的潜力。

Abstract: The gas-kinetic scheme(GKS) is a promising computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
method for solving the Navier-Stokes equations. It is based on the analytical
solution of the BGK equation, which enables accurate and robust simulations.
While GKS has demonstrated excellent properties (e.g., unified treatment of
inviscid and viscous fluxes, inherent adaptive dissipation control), its
application to classical engineering problems, such as aerodynamic flows and
fluid machinery, remains underdeveloped compared to conventional CFD methods.
This study bridges this gap by advancing GKS capabilities for real-world
engineering challenges. First, the GKS is extended to a rotating coordinate
frame, enabling efficient simulations of internal flows in turbomachinery.
Second, the computational inefficiency of explicit GKS is addressed through an
implicit time discretization using the generalized minimal residual method. The
Jacobian matrices for inviscid/viscous fluxes are approximated using the
first-order kinetic flux vector splitting scheme and the thin shear layer
approximation to enhance robustness and computational efficiency further.
Third, the shear-stress transport turbulence model is coupled to expand GKS's
applicability to industrial turbulent flows. Numerical tests, including
internal compressor rotor flow and external flow over a 3-D wingbody, validate
the proposed method's accuracy and efficiency. Via our implicit scheme, the
force coefficients of the 3-D wing-body flow with about five million mesh
elements can converge after 500 steps. This work represents a practical
advancement of GKS, demonstrating its potential to compete with established CFD
solvers in high-Reynolds-number external and internal turbulent flows.

TL;DR: 研究开发了一种预测模型，用于预测受逆压梯度影响的湍流边界层中的平均速度剖面和总剪应力剖面，特别关注历史效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 逆压梯度对湍流边界层的影响复杂，现有模型难以准确捕捉历史效应，因此需要开发新方法。

Method: 基于近壁相似性，引入修正的摩擦速度标度，并开发了包含压力梯度流向导数的估计-校正模型。

Result: 模型在多种DNS/LES数据集上验证，能准确预测平均速度剖面和总剪应力剖面。

Conclusion: 新模型有效捕捉了历史效应，适用于广泛的逆压梯度和雷诺数范围。

Abstract: This study focuses on developing a predictive model for mean velocity
profiles and total shear stress profiles in turbulent boundary layers subjected
to adverse pressure gradients, especially with history effects. Based on
universal near-wall similarity, a new scaling using friction velocity modified
by Clauser pressure gradient parameter is introduced to restore streamwise
self-similarity. Furthermore, an estimation-correction model is developed,
explicitly incorporating a streamwise derivative for pressure gradient, which
effectively captures history effect beyond the reach of Reynolds-averaged
Navier-Stokes equations. A detailed analysis is conducted on the corrected
model of total shear stress, which is decomposed into four parts, in which the
latter two parts correspond to non-equilibrium effect, and they are considered
the first-order history effect. Generally, they tend to offset each other, but
in downstream region, their combined effect is significantly stronger,
accounting for up to approximately half of the total stress. Validation against
multiple DNS/LES datasets across a wide range of pressure gradients and
Reynolds numbers demonstrates model's accuracy in predicting both mean velocity
profiles and total shear stress profiles.

Conclusion: 新拉格朗日方法无需人工粘度，性能与现有最佳方法相当，展示了拉格朗日模拟的潜力。

Abstract: Numerical simulations of the air in the atmosphere and water in the oceans
are essential for numerical weather prediction. The state-of-the-art for
performing these fluid simulations relies on an Eulerian viewpoint, in which
the fluid domain is discretized into a mesh, and the governing equations
describe the fluid motion as it passes through each cell of the mesh. However,
it is unclear whether a Lagrangian viewpoint, in which the fluid is discretized
by a collection of particles, can outperform Eulerian simulations in global
atmospheric simulations. To date, Lagrangian approaches have shown promise, but
tend to produce smoother solutions. In this work, a new Lagrangian method is
developed to simulate the atmosphere in which particles are represented with
spherical power cells. We introduce an efficient algorithm for computing these
cells which are then used to discretize the spherical shallow water equations.
Mass conservation is enforced by solving a semi-discrete optimal transport
problem and a semi-implicit time stepping procedure is used to advance the
solution in time. We note that, in contrast to previous work, artificial
viscosity is not needed to stabilize the simulation. The performance of the
spherical Voronoi diagram calculation is first assessed, which shows that
spherical Voronoi diagrams of 100 million sites can be computed in under 2
minutes on a single machine. The new simulation method is then evaluated on
standard benchmark test cases, which shows that momentum and energy
conservation of this new method is comparable to the latest Lagrangian approach
for simulating the spherical shallow water equations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pasur游戏规则复杂且游戏树庞大，传统方法难以高效处理，因此需要一种新的计算框架。

Method: 使用PyTorch CUDA张量处理规则复杂性，并通过分解游戏树和轮次反向训练策略降低内存和计算复杂度。

Result: 构建了包含超过10^9个节点的完整游戏树，并训练了基于树的模型预测策略。

Conclusion: 该框架可扩展至其他多轮次强化学习问题，如回合制策略游戏或金融市场决策。

Abstract: Pasur is a fishing card game played over six rounds and is played similarly
to games such as Cassino and Scopa, and Bastra. This paper introduces a
CUDA-accelerated computational framework for simulating Pasur, emphasizing
efficient memory management. We use our framework to compute near-Nash
equilibria via Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR), a well-known algorithm
for solving large imperfect-information games.
  Solving Pasur presents unique challenges due to its intricate rules and the
large size of its game tree. We handle rule complexity using PyTorch CUDA
tensors and to address the memory-intensive nature of the game, we decompose
the game tree into two key components: (1) actual game states, and (2)
inherited scores from previous rounds. We construct the Full Game Tree by
pairing card states with accumulated scores in the Unfolding Process. This
design reduces memory overhead by storing only essential strategy values and
node connections. To further manage computational complexity, we apply a
round-by-round backward training strategy, starting from the final round and
recursively propagating average utilities to earlier stages. Our approach
constructs the complete game tree, which on average consists of over $10^9$
nodes. We provide detailed implementation snippets.
  After computing a near-Nash equilibrium strategy, we train a tree-based model
to predict these strategies for use during gameplay. We then estimate the fair
value of each deck through large-scale self-play between equilibrium strategies
by simulating, for instance, 10,000 games per matchup, executed in parallel
using GPU acceleration.
  Similar frameworks can be extended to other reinforcement learning algorithms
where the action tree naturally decomposes into multiple rounds such as
turn-based strategy games or sequential trading decisions in financial markets.

Abstract: The history of science is punctuated by serendipitous discoveries, where
unexpected observations, rather than targeted hypotheses, opened new fields of
inquiry. While modern autonomous laboratories excel at accelerating hypothesis
testing, their optimization for efficiency risks overlooking these crucial,
unplanned findings. To address this gap, we introduce SciLink, an open-source,
multi-agent artificial intelligence framework designed to operationalize
serendipity in materials research by creating a direct, automated link between
experimental observation, novelty assessment, and theoretical simulations. The
framework employs a hybrid AI strategy where specialized machine learning
models perform quantitative analysis of experimental data, while large language
models handle higher-level reasoning. These agents autonomously convert raw
data from materials characterization techniques into falsifiable scientific
claims, which are then quantitatively scored for novelty against the published
literature. We demonstrate the framework's versatility across diverse research
scenarios, showcasing its application to atomic-resolution and hyperspectral
data, its capacity to integrate real-time human expert guidance, and its
ability to close the research loop by proposing targeted follow-up experiments.
By systematically analyzing all observations and contextualizing them, SciLink
provides a practical framework for AI-driven materials research that not only
enhances efficiency but also actively cultivates an environment ripe for
serendipitous discoveries, thereby bridging the gap between automated
experimentation and open-ended scientific exploration.

Conclusion: IRL-VLA框架为闭环自动驾驶研究提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated potential in autonomous
driving. However, two critical challenges hinder their development: (1)
Existing VLA architectures are typically based on imitation learning in
open-loop setup which tends to capture the recorded behaviors in the dataset,
leading to suboptimal and constrained performance, (2) Close-loop training
relies heavily on high-fidelity sensor simulation, where domain gaps and
computational inefficiencies pose significant barriers. In this paper, we
introduce IRL-VLA, a novel close-loop Reinforcement Learning via
\textbf{I}nverse \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning reward world model
with a self-built VLA approach. Our framework proceeds in a three-stage
paradigm: In the first stage, we propose a VLA architecture and pretrain the
VLA policy via imitation learning. In the second stage, we construct a
lightweight reward world model via inverse reinforcement learning to enable
efficient close-loop reward computation. To further enhance planning
performance, finally, we design specialized reward world model guidence
reinforcement learning via PPO(Proximal Policy Optimization) to effectively
balance the safety incidents, comfortable driving, and traffic efficiency. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in NAVSIM v2 end-to-end driving
benchmark, 1st runner up in CVPR2025 Autonomous Grand Challenge. We hope that
our framework will accelerate VLA research in close-loop autonomous driving.

TL;DR: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉场景理解上表现流畅，但缺乏对象计数的基本认知能力。CountQA是一个新基准，用于评估和改善这一缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在对象计数方面的能力不足限制了其实际应用，现有基准未能充分测试复杂场景下的表现。

Method: 引入CountQA基准，包含1,500多个问答对，覆盖高密度、遮挡和杂乱的现实图像。

Result: 评估15种MLLMs，最佳模型准确率仅42.9%，且性能随对象数量增加而下降。

Conclusion: CountQA为改进MLLMs的计数能力提供了工具，推动其向更全面、可靠的方向发展。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable fluency in
understanding visual scenes, yet they exhibit a critical lack in a fundamental
cognitive skill: object counting. This blind spot severely limits their
reliability in real-world applications. To date, this capability has been
largely unevaluated in complex scenarios, as existing benchmarks either feature
sparse object densities or are confined to specific visual domains, failing to
test models under realistic conditions. Addressing this gap, we introduce
CountQA, a challenging new benchmark designed to probe this deficiency.
Comprising over 1,500 question-answer pairs, CountQA features real-world images
with high object density, clutter, and occlusion. We investigate this weakness
by evaluating 15 prominent MLLMs on the CountQA benchmark and reveal that the
top-performing model achieves a mere 42.9% accuracy, with performance declining
as object counts rise. By providing a dedicated benchmark to diagnose and
rectify this core weakness, CountQA paves the way for a new generation of MLLMs
that are not only descriptively fluent but also numerically grounded and
spatially aware. We will open-source the dataset and code upon paper acceptance
to foster further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FCA在知识表示和发现中具有潜力，但其数学基础文献使其在变异性任务中的应用不够直观。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 收集并分析FCA框架中与变异性分析相关的关键特性，并探讨如何利用这些特性解释变异性信息。

Result: 明确了FCA中适用于变异性分析的特性及其在概念结构中的应用方式。

Conclusion: FCA的特性可以有效支持变异性分析，本文为相关任务提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a mathematical framework for knowledge
representation and discovery. It performs a hierarchical clustering over a set
of objects described by attributes, resulting in conceptual structures in which
objects are organized depending on the attributes they share. These conceptual
structures naturally highlight commonalities and variabilities among similar
objects by categorizing them into groups which are then arranged by similarity,
making it particularly appropriate for variability extraction and analysis.
Despite the potential of FCA, determining which of its properties can be
leveraged for variability-related tasks (and how) is not always
straightforward, partly due to the mathematical orientation of its foundational
literature. This paper attempts to bridge part of this gap by gathering a
selection of properties of the framework which are essential to variability
analysis, and how they can be used to interpret diverse variability information
within the resulting conceptual structures.

Method: 结合高斯混合模型与VAE以识别场景自适应专家，设计时空感知模块捕捉序列特征和位置不确定性，使用约束路径查找算法重建道路ID序列。

Result: 实验表明，模型在零样本CTMM中性能优于现有方法16.8%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过知识共享和轨迹校准，显著提升了零样本CTMM的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Cellular Trajectory Map-Matching (CTMM) aims to align cellular location
sequences to road networks, which is a necessary preprocessing in
location-based services on web platforms like Google Maps, including navigation
and route optimization. Current approaches mainly rely on ID-based features and
region-specific data to learn correlations between cell towers and roads,
limiting their adaptability to unexplored areas. To enable high-accuracy CTMM
without additional training in target regions, Zero-shot CTMM requires to
extract not only region-adaptive features, but also sequential and location
uncertainty to alleviate positioning errors in cellular data. In this paper, we
propose a pixel-based trajectory calibration assistant for zero-shot CTMM,
which takes advantage of transferable geospatial knowledge to calibrate
pixelated trajectory, and then guide the path-finding process at the road
network level. To enhance knowledge sharing across similar regions, a Gaussian
mixture model is incorporated into VAE, enabling the identification of
scenario-adaptive experts through soft clustering. To mitigate high positioning
errors, a spatial-temporal awareness module is designed to capture sequential
features and location uncertainty, thereby facilitating the inference of
approximate user positions. Finally, a constrained path-finding algorithm is
employed to reconstruct the road ID sequence, ensuring topological validity
within the road network. This process is guided by the calibrated trajectory
while optimizing for the shortest feasible path, thus minimizing unnecessary
detours. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing
methods in zero-shot CTMM by 16.8\%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于规则的知识图谱补全方法虽然可解释，但需要大量规则才能达到竞争性能，导致规则集过大而影响可解释性。

Method: 从训练数据中发现规则上下文，利用概率电路学习这些上下文的概率分布，快速达到完整规则集的性能。

Result: 规则数量减少70-96%，性能最高提升31倍，保留基线峰值性能的91%。

Conclusion: 该方法在8个标准数据集上验证有效，无需独立性假设，适用于概率逻辑推理，可能对规则学习的概率推理有更广泛影响。

Abstract: Rule-based methods for knowledge graph completion provide explainable results
but often require a significantly large number of rules to achieve competitive
performance. This can hinder explainability due to overwhelmingly large rule
sets. We discover rule contexts (meaningful subsets of rules that work
together) from training data and use learned probability distribution (i.e.
probabilistic circuits) over these rule contexts to more rapidly achieve
performance of the full rule set. Our approach achieves a 70-96% reduction in
number of rules used while outperforming baseline by up to 31$\times$ when
using equivalent minimal number of rules and preserves 91% of peak baseline
performance even when comparing our minimal rule sets against baseline's full
rule sets. We show that our framework is grounded in well-known semantics of
probabilistic logic, does not require independence assumptions, and that our
tractable inference procedure provides both approximate lower bounds and exact
probability of a given query. The efficacy of our method is validated by
empirical studies on 8 standard benchmark datasets where we show competitive
performance by using only a fraction of the rules required by AnyBURL's
standard inference method, the current state-of-the-art for rule-based
knowledge graph completion. This work may have further implications for general
probabilistic reasoning over learned sets of rules.

Result: 在知识图谱补全任务中显著优于现有方法，且对噪声数据具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GLIDR结合深度网络可实现端到端优化，适用于多模态数据。

Abstract: Differentiable inductive logic programming (ILP) techniques have proven
effective at finding approximate rule-based solutions to link prediction and
node classification problems on knowledge graphs; however, the common
assumption of chain-like rule structure can hamper the performance and
interpretability of existing approaches. We introduce GLIDR, a differentiable
rule learning method that models the inference of logic rules with more
expressive syntax than previous methods. GLIDR uses a differentiable message
passing inference algorithm that generalizes previous chain-like rule learning
methods to allow rules with features like branches and cycles. GLIDR has a
simple and expressive rule search space which is parameterized by a limit on
the maximum number of free variables that may be included in a rule. Explicit
logic rules can be extracted from the weights of a GLIDR model for use with
symbolic solvers. We demonstrate that GLIDR can significantly outperform
existing rule learning methods on knowledge graph completion tasks and even
compete with embedding methods despite the inherent disadvantage of being a
structure-only prediction method. We show that rules extracted from GLIDR
retain significant predictive performance, and that GLIDR is highly robust to
training data noise. Finally, we demonstrate that GLIDR can be chained with
deep neural networks and optimized end-to-end for rule learning on arbitrary
data modalities.

parallelization capabilities of Balans, a recently proposed multi-armed

modular architecture inherently supports parallel exploration of diverse

address this gap, we introduce ParBalans, an extension that leverages both

Abstract: With the growing demand for Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks in
sensitive applications, such as urban monitoring, emergency response, and
secure sensing, ensuring reliable connectivity and covert communication has
become increasingly vital. However, dynamic mobility and exposure risks pose
significant challenges. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a
self-organizing UAV network framework combining Graph Diffusion-based Policy
Optimization (GDPO) with a Stackelberg Game (SG)-based incentive mechanism. The
GDPO method uses generative AI to dynamically generate sparse but
well-connected topologies, enabling flexible adaptation to changing node
distributions and Ground User (GU) demands. Meanwhile, the Stackelberg Game
(SG)-based incentive mechanism guides self-interested UAVs to choose relay
behaviors and neighbor links that support cooperation and enhance covert
communication. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of model convergence, topology
generation quality, and enhancement of covert communication performance.

Abstract: The advent of ultra-low-bit LLM models (1/1.58/2-bit), which match the
perplexity and end-task performance of their full-precision counterparts using
the same model size, is ushering in a new era of LLM inference for
resource-constrained environments such as edge devices and AI PCs. While these
quantization advances promise models that are more cost-effective in terms of
latency, memory, throughput, and energy consumption, the computational
efficiency of state-of-the-art (SOTA) inference runtimes (e.g., bitnet.cpp)
used to deploy them remains underexplored. In this work, we take a bottom-up
approach: we first design and implement 1-bit and 2-bit microkernels optimized
for modern CPUs, achieving peak computational efficiency across a variety of
CPU platforms. We integrate these microkernels into a state-of-the-art LLM
inference framework, namely PyTorch-TPP, and present end-to-end inference
results with 2-bit models that outperform the current SOTA runtime bitnet.cpp
by up to 2.2x, and deliver up to 7x speedup compared to the 16-bit model
inference. Our optimized runtime advances the state of LLM inference on AI PCs
and edge devices, paving the way for efficient deployment of ultra-low-bit LLM
models.

Conclusion: 该框架为LLMs在不确定或动态环境中提供了一种可复用、安全且目标对齐的行为结构化方法，适用于教育及其他交互密集型领域。

Abstract: We introduce a modular prompting framework that supports safer and more
adaptive use of large language models (LLMs) across dynamic, user-centered
tasks. Grounded in human learning theory, particularly the Zone of Proximal
Development (ZPD), our method combines a natural language boundary prompt with
a control schema encoded with fuzzy scaffolding logic and adaptation rules.
This architecture enables LLMs to modulate behavior in response to user state
without requiring fine-tuning or external orchestration. In a simulated
intelligent tutoring setting, the framework improves scaffolding quality,
adaptivity, and instructional alignment across multiple models, outperforming
standard prompting baselines. Evaluation is conducted using rubric-based LLM
graders at scale. While initially developed for education, the framework has
shown promise in other interaction-heavy domains, such as procedural content
generation for games. Designed for safe deployment, it provides a reusable
methodology for structuring interpretable, goal-aligned LLM behavior in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 体数据探索对科学数据集解释至关重要，但缺乏领域知识或3D导航经验的用户难以选择最佳视点。

Method: 将体数据块编码以区分结构，结合CLIP Score提供语义信息，利用强化学习框架搜索符合用户意图的视点。

Result: 自动化视点选择提高了体数据导航效率，并增强了复杂科学现象的可解释性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过自然语言交互和语义引导，显著提升了体数据探索的效果和用户体验。

Abstract: Exploring volumetric data is crucial for interpreting scientific datasets.
However, selecting optimal viewpoints for effective navigation can be
challenging, particularly for users without extensive domain expertise or
familiarity with 3D navigation. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
that leverages natural language interaction to enhance volumetric data
exploration. Our approach encodes volumetric blocks to capture and
differentiate underlying structures. It further incorporates a CLIP Score
mechanism, which provides semantic information to the blocks to guide
navigation. The navigation is empowered by a reinforcement learning framework
that leverage these semantic cues to efficiently search for and identify
desired viewpoints that align with the user's intent. The selected viewpoints
are evaluated using CLIP Score to ensure that they best reflect the user
queries. By automating viewpoint selection, our method improves the efficiency
of volumetric data navigation and enhances the interpretability of complex
scientific phenomena.

Abstract: The mainstream paradigm of remote sensing image interpretation has long been
dominated by vision-centered models, which rely on visual features for semantic
understanding. However, these models face inherent limitations in handling
multi-modal reasoning, semantic abstraction, and interactive decision-making.
While recent advances have introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) into remote
sensing workflows, existing studies primarily focus on downstream applications,
lacking a unified theoretical framework that explains the cognitive role of
language. This review advocates a paradigm shift from vision-centered to
language-centered remote sensing interpretation. Drawing inspiration from the
Global Workspace Theory (GWT) of human cognition, We propose a
language-centered framework for remote sensing interpretation that treats LLMs
as the cognitive central hub integrating perceptual, task, knowledge and action
spaces to enable unified understanding, reasoning, and decision-making. We
first explore the potential of LLMs as the central cognitive component in
remote sensing interpretation, and then summarize core technical challenges,
including unified multimodal representation, knowledge association, and
reasoning and decision-making. Furthermore, we construct a global
workspace-driven interpretation mechanism and review how language-centered
solutions address each challenge. Finally, we outline future research
directions from four perspectives: adaptive alignment of multimodal data, task
understanding under dynamic knowledge constraints, trustworthy reasoning, and
autonomous interaction. This work aims to provide a conceptual foundation for
the next generation of remote sensing interpretation systems and establish a
roadmap toward cognition-driven intelligent geospatial analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体强化学习中的信用分配问题复杂，尤其是当任务涉及不同协作层次时，传统方法难以准确评估每个智能体的贡献。

Method: 提出MACA方法，利用多级优势函数进行显式反事实推理，结合注意力机制识别智能体间的相关性，构建多级优势以指导策略学习。

Result: 在Starcraft v1&v2任务上的实验表明，MACA在复杂信用分配场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: MACA通过多级优势信用分配，有效解决了多智能体协作中的信用分配问题，适用于复杂任务。

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) aims to coordinate
multiple agents to achieve a common goal. A key challenge in MARL is credit
assignment, which involves assessing each agent's contribution to the shared
reward. Given the diversity of tasks, agents may perform different types of
coordination, with rewards attributed to diverse and often overlapping agent
subsets. In this work, we formalize the credit assignment level as the number
of agents cooperating to obtain a reward, and address scenarios with multiple
coexisting levels. We introduce a multi-level advantage formulation that
performs explicit counterfactual reasoning to infer credits across distinct
levels. Our method, Multi-level Advantage Credit Assignment (MACA), captures
agent contributions at multiple levels by integrating advantage functions that
reason about individual, joint, and correlated actions. Utilizing an
attention-based framework, MACA identifies correlated agent relationships and
constructs multi-level advantages to guide policy learning. Comprehensive
experiments on challenging Starcraft v1\&v2 tasks demonstrate MACA's superior
performance, underscoring its efficacy in complex credit assignment scenarios.

Motivation: 当前MLLMs的评估基准存在规模小、覆盖窄和知识无结构化的问题，无法全面衡量模型智能。

Method: 提出MDK12-Bench基准，基于真实K-12考试数据构建，包含141K实例和6,225个知识点，采用动态评估框架和知识增强生成（KP-RAG）方法。

Result: 发现当前MLLMs在多个方面存在局限性，为提升模型鲁棒性和可解释性提供了指导。

Conclusion: MDK12-Bench为MLLMs的全面评估和AI辅助教育提供了重要工具和方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which integrate language and visual
cues for problem-solving, are crucial for advancing artificial general
intelligence (AGI). However, current benchmarks for measuring the intelligence
of MLLMs suffer from limited scale, narrow coverage, and unstructured
knowledge, offering only static and undifferentiated evaluations. To bridge
this gap, we introduce MDK12-Bench, a large-scale multidisciplinary benchmark
built from real-world K-12 exams spanning six disciplines with 141K instances
and 6,225 knowledge points organized in a six-layer taxonomy. Covering five
question formats with difficulty and year annotations, it enables comprehensive
evaluation to capture the extent to which MLLMs perform over four dimensions:
1) difficulty levels, 2) temporal (cross-year) shifts, 3) contextual shifts,
and 4) knowledge-driven reasoning. We propose a novel dynamic evaluation
framework that introduces unfamiliar visual, textual, and question form shifts
to challenge model generalization while improving benchmark objectivity and
longevity by mitigating data contamination. We further evaluate knowledge-point
reference-augmented generation (KP-RAG) to examine the role of knowledge in
problem-solving. Key findings reveal limitations in current MLLMs in multiple
aspects and provide guidance for enhancing model robustness, interpretability,
and AI-assisted education.

Conclusion: MMLM为自动化气象预警系统迈出关键一步，代码和数据集将开源。

Abstract: Timely and accurate severe weather warnings are critical for disaster
mitigation. However, current forecasting systems remain heavily reliant on
manual expert interpretation, introducing subjectivity and significant
operational burdens. With the rapid development of AI technologies, the
end-to-end "AI weather station" is gradually emerging as a new trend in
predicting severe weather events. Three core challenges impede the development
of end-to-end AI severe weather system: (1) scarcity of severe weather event
samples; (2) imperfect alignment between high-dimensional meteorological data
and textual warnings; (3) existing multimodal language models are unable to
handle high-dimensional meteorological data and struggle to fully capture the
complex dependencies across temporal sequences, vertical pressure levels, and
spatial dimensions. To address these challenges, we introduce MP-Bench, the
first large-scale temporal multimodal dataset for severe weather events
prediction, comprising 421,363 pairs of raw multi-year meteorological data and
corresponding text caption, covering a wide range of severe weather scenarios
across China. On top of this dataset, we develop a meteorology multimodal large
model (MMLM) that directly ingests 4D meteorological inputs. In addition, it is
designed to accommodate the unique characteristics of 4D meteorological data
flow, incorporating three plug-and-play adaptive fusion modules that enable
dynamic feature extraction and integration across temporal sequences, vertical
pressure layers, and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments on MP-Bench
demonstrate that MMLM performs exceptionally well across multiple tasks,
highlighting its effectiveness in severe weather understanding and marking a
key step toward realizing automated, AI-driven weather forecasting systems. Our
source code and dataset will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于确定性下推自动机的奖励机器（pdRMs），扩展了传统奖励机器（RMs）的表达能力，能够识别和奖励确定性上下文无关语言表示的行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RMs只能处理正则语言表示的行为，限制了其在复杂任务中的应用。pdRMs通过引入下推自动机结构，扩展了表达能力，适用于更广泛的时序行为任务。

Method: 提出了两种基于pdRM的策略：一种可以访问整个堆栈，另一种只能访问堆栈顶部的k个符号。并提供了检查这两种策略是否达到相同最优奖励的方法。

Result: 理论分析表明pdRMs的表达能力更强，并提供了学习问题的空间复杂度结果。实验证明，pdRMs可以成功训练代理完成确定性上下文无关语言表示的任务。

Conclusion: pdRMs显著扩展了RMs的表达能力，适用于更复杂的时序行为任务，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) are automata structures that encode (non-Markovian)
reward functions for reinforcement learning (RL). RMs can reward any behaviour
representable in regular languages and, when paired with RL algorithms that
exploit RM structure, have been shown to significantly improve sample
efficiency in many domains. In this work, we present pushdown reward machines
(pdRMs), an extension of reward machines based on deterministic pushdown
automata. pdRMs can recognize and reward temporally extended behaviours
representable in deterministic context-free languages, making them more
expressive than reward machines. We introduce two variants of pdRM-based
policies, one which has access to the entire stack of the pdRM, and one which
can only access the top $k$ symbols (for a given constant $k$) of the stack. We
propose a procedure to check when the two kinds of policies (for a given
environment, pdRM, and constant $k$) achieve the same optimal expected reward.
We then provide theoretical results establishing the expressive power of pdRMs,
and space complexity results about the proposed learning problems. Finally, we
provide experimental results showing how agents can be trained to perform tasks
representable in deterministic context-free languages using pdRMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的分布式引导局部搜索（DGLS）方法，用于解决分布式约束优化问题（DCOPs），通过改进GDBA的不足，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GDBA在解决DCOPs时存在过早收敛问题，且性能提升有限，论文旨在通过改进其缺点（如过度激进的约束违反条件、无限制的惩罚积累等）提出更优方法。

Method: 提出DGLS框架，包含自适应违反条件、惩罚蒸发机制和同步惩罚更新方案，理论证明其惩罚值有界且代理间形成潜在博弈。

Result: DGLS在标准基准测试中表现优异，尤其在结构化问题上显著优于现有基线（性能提升3.77%--66.3%）。

Conclusion: DGLS通过系统性改进GDBA的不足，成为解决DCOPs的高效方法，尤其在结构化问题上表现突出。

Abstract: Local search is an important class of incomplete algorithms for solving
Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) but it often converges to
poor local optima. While GDBA provides a comprehensive rule set to escape
premature convergence, its empirical benefits remain marginal on general-valued
problems. In this work, we systematically examine GDBA and identify three
factors that potentially lead to its inferior performance, i.e.,
over-aggressive constraint violation conditions, unbounded penalty
accumulation, and uncoordinated penalty updates. To address these issues, we
propose Distributed Guided Local Search (DGLS), a novel GLS framework for DCOPs
that incorporates an adaptive violation condition to selectively penalize
constraints with high cost, a penalty evaporation mechanism to control the
magnitude of penalization, and a synchronization scheme for coordinated penalty
updates. We theoretically show that the penalty values are bounded, and agents
play a potential game in our DGLS. Our extensive empirical results on various
standard benchmarks demonstrate the great superiority of DGLS over
state-of-the-art baselines. Particularly, compared to Damped Max-sum with high
damping factors (e.g., 0.7 or 0.9), our DGLS achieves competitive performance
on general-valued problems, and outperforms it by significant margins
(\textbf{3.77\%--66.3\%}) on structured problems in terms of anytime results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交互式定理证明器（ITPs）需要手动形式化，工作量大且需专业知识。自动形式化面临模型幻觉和语义鸿沟的挑战。

Method: 提出CRAMF框架，从Mathlib4构建概念定义知识库，采用上下文查询增强和双通道混合检索策略。

Result: 在miniF2F、ProofNet和AdvancedMath基准测试中，CRAMF显著提升翻译准确率，最高达62.1%，平均提升29.9%。

Conclusion: CRAMF通过检索增强和精确检索策略，有效提升了自动形式化的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) require manual formalization, which is
labor-intensive and demands expert knowledge. While automated formalization
offers a potential solution, it faces two major challenges: model hallucination
(e.g., undefined predicates, symbol misuse, and version incompatibility) and
the semantic gap caused by ambiguous or missing premises in natural language
descriptions. To address these issues, we propose CRAMF, a Concept-driven
Retrieval-Augmented Mathematical Formalization framework. CRAMF enhances
LLM-based autoformalization by retrieving formal definitions of core
mathematical concepts, providing contextual grounding during code generation.
However, applying retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in this setting is
non-trivial due to the lack of structured knowledge bases, the polymorphic
nature of mathematical concepts, and the high precision required in formal
retrieval. We introduce a framework for automatically constructing a
concept-definition knowledge base from Mathlib4, the standard mathematical
library for the Lean 4 theorem prover, indexing over 26,000 formal definitions
and 1,000+ core mathematical concepts. To address conceptual polymorphism, we
propose contextual query augmentation with domain- and application-level
signals. In addition, we design a dual-channel hybrid retrieval strategy with
reranking to ensure accurate and relevant definition retrieval. Experiments on
miniF2F, ProofNet, and our newly proposed AdvancedMath benchmark show that
CRAMF can be seamlessly integrated into LLM-based autoformalizers, yielding
consistent improvements in translation accuracy, achieving up to 62.1% and an
average of 29.9% relative improvement.

Motivation: 多模态学习在农业中具有潜力，但模型的可解释性常被忽视。本文旨在利用Transformer的内在可解释性，提高多模态学习网络的可解释性。

Method: 使用Transformer模型处理四种输入模态（多光谱卫星数据、天气时间序列、地形高程图和土壤属性），并通过注意力机制（AR和GA）和Shapley值（SVS）进行特征归因分析，提出WMA方法评估模态归因。

Result: Transformer模型在子田块和田块级别的预测性能优于卷积和循环网络（R2分别提高0.10和0.04），AR在时间归因上表现更稳健。

Conclusion: Transformer模型在多模态学习中表现优异，AR方法提供了更可靠的解释，模态归因方法揭示了不同模式，为农业决策提供了支持。

Abstract: Multimodal learning enables various machine learning tasks to benefit from
diverse data sources, effectively mimicking the interplay of different factors
in real-world applications, particularly in agriculture. While the
heterogeneous nature of involved data modalities may necessitate the design of
complex architectures, the model interpretability is often overlooked. In this
study, we leverage the intrinsic explainability of Transformer-based models to
explain multimodal learning networks, focusing on the task of crop yield
prediction at the subfield level. The large datasets used cover various crops,
regions, and years, and include four different input modalities: multispectral
satellite and weather time series, terrain elevation maps and soil properties.
Based on the self-attention mechanism, we estimate feature attributions using
two methods, namely the Attention Rollout (AR) and Generic Attention (GA), and
evaluate their performance against Shapley-based model-agnostic estimations,
Shapley Value Sampling (SVS). Additionally, we propose the Weighted Modality
Activation (WMA) method to assess modality attributions and compare it with SVS
attributions. Our findings indicate that Transformer-based models outperform
other architectures, specifically convolutional and recurrent networks,
achieving R2 scores that are higher by 0.10 and 0.04 at the subfield and field
levels, respectively. AR is shown to provide more robust and reliable temporal
attributions, as confirmed through qualitative and quantitative evaluation,
compared to GA and SVS values. Information about crop phenology stages was
leveraged to interpret the explanation results in the light of established
agronomic knowledge. Furthermore, modality attributions revealed varying
patterns across the two methods compared.[...]

Motivation: 探讨LLM是否能替代人类参与者进行心理学研究，并揭示其局限性。

Method: 通过概念论证和实证证据（如微调后的CENTAUR模型）展示LLM与人类反应的差异。

Result: LLM对微小语言变化反应不一致，且不同模型间差异显著，无法可靠模拟人类心理学。

Conclusion: LLM不能模拟人类心理学，心理学研究需将其视为需验证的工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs),such as ChatGPT, are increasingly used in
research, ranging from simple writing assistance to complex data annotation
tasks. Recently, some research has suggested that LLMs may even be able to
simulate human psychology and can, hence, replace human participants in
psychological studies. We caution against this approach. We provide conceptual
arguments against the hypothesis that LLMs simulate human psychology. We then
present empiric evidence illustrating our arguments by demonstrating that
slight changes to wording that correspond to large changes in meaning lead to
notable discrepancies between LLMs' and human responses, even for the recent
CENTAUR model that was specifically fine-tuned on psychological responses.
Additionally, different LLMs show very different responses to novel items,
further illustrating their lack of reliability. We conclude that LLMs do not
simulate human psychology and recommend that psychological researchers should
treat LLMs as useful but fundamentally unreliable tools that need to be
validated against human responses for every new application.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models has fundamentally shifted the
bottleneck in AI development from computational power to data availability-with
countless valuable datasets remaining hidden across specialized repositories,
research appendices, and domain platforms. As reasoning capabilities and deep
research methodologies continue to evolve, a critical question emerges: can AI
agents transcend conventional search to systematically discover any dataset
that meets specific user requirements, enabling truly autonomous demand-driven
data curation? We introduce DatasetResearch, the first comprehensive benchmark
evaluating AI agents' ability to discover and synthesize datasets from 208
real-world demands across knowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive tasks.
Our tri-dimensional evaluation framework reveals a stark reality: even advanced
deep research systems achieve only 22% score on our challenging
DatasetResearch-pro subset, exposing the vast gap between current capabilities
and perfect dataset discovery. Our analysis uncovers a fundamental
dichotomy-search agents excel at knowledge tasks through retrieval breadth,
while synthesis agents dominate reasoning challenges via structured
generation-yet both catastrophically fail on "corner cases" outside existing
distributions. These findings establish the first rigorous baseline for dataset
discovery agents and illuminate the path toward AI systems capable of finding
any dataset in the digital universe. Our benchmark and comprehensive analysis
provide the foundation for the next generation of self-improving AI systems and

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face persistent and evolving trustworthiness
issues, motivating developers to seek automated and flexible repair methods
that enable convenient deployment across diverse scenarios. Existing repair
methods like supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) are costly and slow, while prompt engineering lacks robustness
and scalability. Representation engineering, which steers model behavior by
injecting targeted concept vectors during inference, offers a lightweight,
training-free alternative. However, current approaches depend on manually
crafted samples and fixed steering strategies, limiting automation and
adaptability. To overcome these challenges, we propose MASteer, the first
end-to-end framework for trustworthiness repair in LLMs based on representation
engineering. MASteer integrates two core components: AutoTester, a multi-agent
system that generates diverse, high-quality steer samples tailored to developer
needs; and AutoRepairer, which constructs adaptive steering strategies with
anchor vectors for automated, context-aware strategy selection during
inference. Experiments on standard and customized trustworthiness tasks show
MASteer consistently outperforms baselines, improving metrics by 15.36% on
LLaMA-3.1-8B-Chat and 4.21% on Qwen-3-8B-Chat, while maintaining general model
capabilities. MASteer demonstrates strong robustness, generalization, and
practical value for scalable, efficient trustworthiness repair.

Conclusion: DSperse通过灵活的验证边界设计，为多样化的部署需求提供了可扩展且高效的验证解决方案。

Abstract: DSperse is a modular framework for distributed machine learning inference
with strategic cryptographic verification. Operating within the emerging
paradigm of distributed zero-knowledge machine learning, DSperse avoids the
high cost and rigidity of full-model circuitization by enabling targeted
verification of strategically chosen subcomputations. These verifiable
segments, or "slices", may cover part or all of the inference pipeline, with
global consistency enforced through audit, replication, or economic incentives.
This architecture supports a pragmatic form of trust minimization, localizing
zero-knowledge proofs to the components where they provide the greatest value.
We evaluate DSperse using multiple proving systems and report empirical results
on memory usage, runtime, and circuit behavior under sliced and unsliced
configurations. By allowing proof boundaries to align flexibly with the model's
logical structure, DSperse supports scalable, targeted verification strategies
suited to diverse deployment needs.

Abstract: With recent and rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI),
understanding the foundation of purposeful behaviour in autonomous agents is
crucial for developing safe and efficient systems. While artificial neural
networks have dominated the path to AI, recent studies are exploring the
potential of biologically based systems, such as networks of living biological
neuronal networks. Along with promises of high power and data efficiency, these
systems may also inform more explainable and biologically plausible models. In
this work, we propose a framework rooted in active inference, a general theory
of behaviour, to model decision-making in embodied agents. Using
experiment-informed generative models, we simulate decision-making processes in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是寻找替代整数规划的优化方法，以解决IHS框架中数值不稳定性和效率问题。

Method: 采用伪布尔推理和随机局部搜索作为替代优化技术，并与商业整数规划求解器进行比较。

Result: 研究发现，伪布尔推理在精确性上可与整数规划求解器竞争，且能提供计算正确性证明。

Conclusion: 尽管商业整数规划求解器效率最高，但伪布尔推理在精确性和可靠性上更具优势，适合需要正确性证明的场景。

Abstract: The implicit hitting set (IHS) approach offers a general framework for
solving computationally hard combinatorial optimization problems declaratively.
IHS iterates between a decision oracle used for extracting sources of
inconsistency and an optimizer for computing so-called hitting sets (HSs) over
the accumulated sources of inconsistency. While the decision oracle is
language-specific, the optimizers is usually instantiated through integer
programming.
  We explore alternative algorithmic techniques for hitting set optimization
based on different ways of employing pseudo-Boolean (PB) reasoning as well as
stochastic local search. We extensively evaluate the practical feasibility of
the alternatives in particular in the context of pseudo-Boolean (0-1 IP)
optimization as one of the most recent instantiations of IHS. Highlighting a
trade-off between efficiency and reliability, while a commercial IP solver
turns out to remain the most effective way to instantiate HS computations, it
can cause correctness issues due to numerical instability; in fact, we show
that exact HS computations instantiated via PB reasoning can be made
competitive with a numerically exact IP solver. Furthermore, the use of PB
reasoning as a basis for HS computations allows for obtaining certificates for
the correctness of IHS computations, generally applicable to any IHS
instantiation in which reasoning in the declarative language at hand can be
captured in the PB-based proof format we employ.

TL;DR: MultiMedEdit是首个针对临床多模态任务的知识编辑（KE）评估基准，揭示了当前方法在复杂临床工作流中的局限性，并为未来开发更鲁棒的KE技术奠定了基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑研究多集中于通用领域和医学QA任务，缺乏对多模态医学场景的关注，而临床决策需要结合视觉推理，因此需要专门评估KE在多模态医学任务中的表现。

Method: 提出MultiMedEdit框架，涵盖理解和推理任务类型，定义三维度量标准（可靠性、通用性、局部性），支持跨范式比较，并在单次编辑和终身编辑设置下进行实验。

Result: 当前方法在泛化和长尾推理方面表现不佳，尤其是在复杂临床工作流中。效率分析揭示了实际部署中的权衡。

Conclusion: MultiMedEdit不仅揭示了当前方法的局限性，还为未来开发临床鲁棒的KE技术提供了基础。

Abstract: Knowledge editing (KE) provides a scalable approach for updating factual
knowledge in large language models without full retraining. While previous
studies have demonstrated effectiveness in general domains and medical QA
tasks, little attention has been paid to KE in multimodal medical scenarios.
Unlike text-only settings, medical KE demands integrating updated knowledge
with visual reasoning to support safe and interpretable clinical decisions. To
address this gap, we propose MultiMedEdit, the first benchmark tailored to
evaluating KE in clinical multimodal tasks. Our framework spans both
understanding and reasoning task types, defines a three-dimensional metric
suite (reliability, generality, and locality), and supports cross-paradigm
comparisons across general and domain-specific models. We conduct extensive
experiments under single-editing and lifelong-editing settings. Results suggest
that current methods struggle with generalization and long-tail reasoning,
particularly in complex clinical workflows. We further present an efficiency
analysis (e.g., edit latency, memory footprint), revealing practical trade-offs
in real-world deployment across KE paradigms. Overall, MultiMedEdit not only
reveals the limitations of current approaches but also provides a solid
foundation for developing clinically robust knowledge editing techniques in the
future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代生物信息学分析的复杂性导致数据生成与科学洞察之间存在巨大差距，现有语言模型难以满足实际分析需求。

Method: 采用分层多代理系统和双循环架构，将复杂目标分解为可执行、可验证的任务，并在安全计算环境中执行。

Result: 在BixBench基准测试中，K-Dense Analyst的准确率达到29.2%，比最佳语言模型（GPT-5）高出6.3个百分点。

Conclusion: 自主科学推理需要专门构建的系统，而不仅仅是增强的语言模型，K-Dense Analyst为生命科学的自动化发现提供了重要进展。

Abstract: The complexity of modern bioinformatics analysis has created a critical gap
between data generation and developing scientific insights. While large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in scientific reasoning, they remain
fundamentally limited when dealing with real-world analytical workflows that
demand iterative computation, tool integration and rigorous validation. We
introduce K-Dense Analyst, a hierarchical multi-agent system that achieves
autonomous bioinformatics analysis through a dual-loop architecture. K-Dense
Analyst, part of the broader K-Dense platform, couples planning with validated
execution using specialized agents to decompose complex objectives into
executable, verifiable tasks within secure computational environments. On
BixBench, a comprehensive benchmark for open-ended biological analysis, K-Dense
Analyst achieves 29.2% accuracy, surpassing the best-performing language model
(GPT-5) by 6.3 percentage points, representing nearly 27% improvement over what
is widely considered the most powerful LLM available. Remarkably, K-Dense
Analyst achieves this performance using Gemini 2.5 Pro, which attains only
18.3% accuracy when used directly, demonstrating that our architectural
innovations unlock capabilities far beyond the underlying model's baseline
performance. Our insights demonstrate that autonomous scientific reasoning
requires more than enhanced language models, it demands purpose-built systems
that can bridge the gap between high-level scientific objectives and low-level
computational execution. These results represent a significant advance toward
fully autonomous computational biologists capable of accelerating discovery
across the life sciences.

Motivation: 随着AI系统在日常生活中的广泛应用，确保其安全性和可靠性变得尤为重要。尽管LLMs在复杂任务中表现出色，但在涉及道德推理、隐性仇恨和性别偏见等主观问题时仍存在不足。

Method: 研究开发了一个基于SOTA模型的实验框架，评估LLMs在情感和攻击性行为识别中的表现，并引入统一基准数据集和SafePhi模型。

Conclusion: 研究强调了引入更多异构数据和人类参与的必要性，以提高模型的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: As AI systems become more integrated into daily life, the need for safer and
more reliable moderation has never been greater. Large Language Models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, surpassing earlier models in
complexity and performance. Their evaluation across diverse tasks has
consistently showcased their potential, enabling the development of adaptive
and personalized agents. However, despite these advancements, LLMs remain prone
to errors, particularly in areas requiring nuanced moral reasoning. They
struggle with detecting implicit hate, offensive language, and gender biases
due to the subjective and context-dependent nature of these issues. Moreover,
their reliance on training data can inadvertently reinforce societal biases,
leading to inconsistencies and ethical concerns in their outputs. To explore
the limitations of LLMs in this role, we developed an experimental framework
based on state-of-the-art (SOTA) models to assess human emotions and offensive
behaviors. The framework introduces a unified benchmark dataset encompassing 49
distinct categories spanning the wide spectrum of human emotions, offensive and
hateful text, and gender and racial biases. Furthermore, we introduced SafePhi,
a QLoRA fine-tuned version of Phi-4, adapting diverse ethical contexts and
outperforming benchmark moderators by achieving a Macro F1 score of 0.89, where
OpenAI Moderator and Llama Guard score 0.77 and 0.74, respectively. This
research also highlights the critical domains where LLM moderators consistently
underperformed, pressing the need to incorporate more heterogeneous and
representative data with human-in-the-loop, for better model robustness and
explainability.

Method: 系统结合LightGBM回归器和增量训练，支持实时更新模型；提供Flask网页界面和SHAP解释工具。

Result: 实验表明，模型重训练后RMSE降低10.7%，干预学生的预测分数持续提升。

Conclusion: 该框架将静态预测器转化为自优化系统，推动教育分析向以人为本、数据驱动和响应式AI发展。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of student performance is essential for timely academic
intervention. However, most machine learning models in education are static and
cannot adapt when new data, such as post-intervention outcomes, become
available. To address this limitation, we propose a Feedback-Driven Decision
Support System (DSS) with a closed-loop architecture that enables continuous
model refinement. The system integrates a LightGBM-based regressor with
incremental retraining, allowing educators to input updated student results,
which automatically trigger model updates. This adaptive mechanism improves
prediction accuracy by learning from real-world academic progress. The platform
features a Flask-based web interface for real-time interaction and incorporates
SHAP for explainability, ensuring transparency. Experimental results show a
10.7\% reduction in RMSE after retraining, with consistent upward adjustments
in predicted scores for intervened students. By transforming static predictors
into self-improving systems, our approach advances educational analytics toward
human-centered, data-driven, and responsive AI. The framework is designed for
integration into LMS and institutional dashboards.

Conclusion: 该框架在复杂业务场景（如收入与销量权衡）中表现突出，优于基线方法。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for summarizing structured enterprise data
across multiple dimensions using large language model (LLM)-based agents.
Traditional table-to-text models often lack the capacity to reason across
hierarchical structures and context-aware deltas, which are essential in
business reporting tasks. Our method introduces a multi-agent pipeline that
extracts, analyzes, and summarizes multi-dimensional data using agents for
slicing, variance detection, context construction, and LLM-based generation.
Our results show that the proposed framework outperforms traditional
approaches, achieving 83\% faithfulness to underlying data, superior coverage
of significant changes, and high relevance scores (4.4/5) for decision-critical
insights. The improvements are especially pronounced in categories involving
subtle trade-offs, such as increased revenue due to price changes amid
declining unit volumes, which competing methods either overlook or address with
limited specificity. We evaluate the framework on Kaggle datasets and
demonstrate significant improvements in faithfulness, relevance, and insight
quality over baseline table summarization approaches.

Conclusion: EndoAgent为内窥镜诊断提供了高效、灵活的AI解决方案，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Developing general artificial intelligence (AI) systems to support endoscopic
image diagnosis is an emerging research priority. Existing methods based on
large-scale pretraining often lack unified coordination across tasks and
struggle to handle the multi-step processes required in complex clinical
workflows. While AI agents have shown promise in flexible instruction parsing
and tool integration across domains, their potential in endoscopy remains
underexplored. To address this gap, we propose EndoAgent, the first
memory-guided agent for vision-to-decision endoscopic analysis that integrates
iterative reasoning with adaptive tool selection and collaboration. Built on a
dual-memory design, it enables sophisticated decision-making by ensuring
logical coherence through short-term action tracking and progressively
enhancing reasoning acuity through long-term experiential learning. To support
diverse clinical tasks, EndoAgent integrates a suite of expert-designed tools
within a unified reasoning loop. We further introduce EndoAgentBench, a
benchmark of 5,709 visual question-answer pairs that assess visual
understanding and language generation capabilities in realistic scenarios.
Extensive experiments show that EndoAgent consistently outperforms both general
and medical multimodal models, exhibiting its strong flexibility and reasoning
capabilities.

Result: 案例研究中构建了XUBench，验证了框架的有效性，并展示了其在学术领域的适用性。

Conclusion: Comp-Comp框架具有跨领域扩展潜力，为基准测试构建提供了新思路。

Abstract: Numerous benchmarks have been built to evaluate the domain-specific abilities
of large language models (LLMs), highlighting the need for effective and
efficient benchmark construction. Existing domain-specific benchmarks primarily
focus on the scaling law, relying on massive corpora for supervised fine-tuning
or generating extensive question sets for broad coverage. However, the impact
of corpus and question-answer (QA) set design on the precision and recall of
domain-specific LLMs remains unexplored. In this paper, we address this gap and
demonstrate that the scaling law is not always the optimal principle for
benchmark construction in specific domains. Instead, we propose Comp-Comp, an
iterative benchmarking framework based on a comprehensiveness-compactness
principle. Here, comprehensiveness ensures semantic recall of the domain, while
compactness enhances precision, guiding both corpus and QA set construction. To
validate our framework, we conducted a case study in a well-renowned
university, resulting in the creation of XUBench, a large-scale and
comprehensive closed-domain benchmark. Although we use the academic domain as
the case in this work, our Comp-Comp framework is designed to be extensible
beyond academia, providing valuable insights for benchmark construction across
various domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在渗透测试中存在错误处理能力差、推理效率低和无法自主完成复杂任务等问题，Pentest-R1旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段强化学习：离线RL基于500多个真实多步骤演练数据集训练基础攻击逻辑，在线RL在交互式CTF环境中通过环境反馈微调模型。

Result: 在AutoPenBench上成功率为24.2%，仅次于Gemini 2.5 Flash；在Cybench上达到15.0%成功率，创开源LLM新纪录。

Conclusion: 两阶段训练协同作用是成功关键，Pentest-R1在渗透测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Automating penetration testing is crucial for enhancing cybersecurity, yet
current Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant limitations in this
domain, including poor error handling, inefficient reasoning, and an inability
to perform complex end-to-end tasks autonomously. To address these challenges,
we introduce Pentest-R1, a novel framework designed to optimize LLM reasoning
capabilities for this task through a two-stage reinforcement learning pipeline.
We first construct a dataset of over 500 real-world, multi-step walkthroughs,
which Pentest-R1 leverages for offline reinforcement learning (RL) to instill
foundational attack logic. Subsequently, the LLM is fine-tuned via online RL in
an interactive Capture The Flag (CTF) environment, where it learns directly
from environmental feedback to develop robust error self-correction and
adaptive strategies. Our extensive experiments on the Cybench and AutoPenBench
benchmarks demonstrate the framework's effectiveness. On AutoPenBench,
Pentest-R1 achieves a 24.2\% success rate, surpassing most state-of-the-art
models and ranking second only to Gemini 2.5 Flash. On Cybench, it attains a
15.0\% success rate in unguided tasks, establishing a new state-of-the-art for
open-source LLMs and matching the performance of top proprietary models.
Ablation studies confirm that the synergy of both training stages is critical
to its success.

Motivation: 现有方法过度优化时间IoU指标，牺牲了语义动作理解，影响TVG的鲁棒性。

Method: 引入三个反转任务（动词补全、动作识别、视频描述），结合强化学习框架优化定位和语义。

Result: 实验显示，在Charades-STA上R1@0.7指标提升7.1%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过反转任务强化语义理解，显著提高了定位准确性。

Abstract: Temporal Video Grounding (TVG) seeks to localize video segments matching a
given textual query. Current methods, while optimizing for high temporal
Intersection-over-Union (IoU), often overfit to this metric, compromising
semantic action understanding in the video and query, a critical factor for
robust TVG. To address this, we introduce Inversion Tasks for TVG (Invert4TVG),
a novel framework that enhances both localization accuracy and action
understanding without additional data. Our approach leverages three inversion
tasks derived from existing TVG annotations: (1) Verb Completion, predicting
masked action verbs in queries from video segments; (2) Action Recognition,
identifying query-described actions; and (3) Video Description, generating
descriptions of video segments that explicitly embed query-relevant actions.
These tasks, integrated with TVG via a reinforcement learning framework with
well-designed reward functions, ensure balanced optimization of localization
and semantics. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving a 7.1\% improvement in R1@0.7 on Charades-STA for a 3B
model compared to Time-R1. By inverting TVG to derive query-related actions
from segments, our approach strengthens semantic understanding, significantly
raising the ceiling of localization accuracy.

Abstract: Given recent breakthroughs in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) and
Large Language Models (LLMs), more and more professional services are being
augmented through Artificial Intelligence (AI), which once seemed impossible to
automate. This paper presents a modular model for leveraging GAI in developing
strategic plans for large scale government organizations and evaluates leading
machine learning techniques in their application towards one of the identified
modules. Specifically, the performance of BERTopic and Non-negative Matrix
Factorization (NMF) are evaluated in their ability to use topic modeling to
generate themes representative of Vision Elements within a strategic plan. To
accomplish this, BERTopic and NMF models are trained using a large volume of
reports from the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The generated topics
from each model are then scored for similarity against the Vision Elements of a
published strategic plan and the results are compared. Our results show that
these techniques are capable of generating themes similar to 100% of the
elements being evaluated against. Further, we conclude that BERTopic performs
best in this application with more than half of its correlated topics achieving
a "medium" or "strong" correlation. A capability of GAI-enabled strategic plan
development impacts a multi-billion dollar industry and assists the federal
government in overcoming regulatory requirements which are crucial to the
public good. Further work will focus on the operationalization of the concept
proven in this study as well as viability of the remaining modules in the
proposed model for GAI-generated strategic plans.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have sparked growing interest in AI
agents capable of solving complex, real-world tasks. However, most existing
agent systems rely on manually crafted configurations that remain static after
deployment, limiting their ability to adapt to dynamic and evolving
environments. To this end, recent research has explored agent evolution
techniques that aim to automatically enhance agent systems based on interaction
data and environmental feedback. This emerging direction lays the foundation
for self-evolving AI agents, which bridge the static capabilities of foundation
models with the continuous adaptability required by lifelong agentic systems.
In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques for
self-evolving agentic systems. Specifically, we first introduce a unified
conceptual framework that abstracts the feedback loop underlying the design of
self-evolving agentic systems. The framework highlights four key components:
System Inputs, Agent System, Environment, and Optimisers, serving as a
foundation for understanding and comparing different strategies. Based on this
framework, we systematically review a wide range of self-evolving techniques
that target different components of the agent system. We also investigate
domain-specific evolution strategies developed for specialised fields such as
biomedicine, programming, and finance, where optimisation objectives are
tightly coupled with domain constraints. In addition, we provide a dedicated
discussion on the evaluation, safety, and ethical considerations for
self-evolving agentic systems, which are critical to ensuring their
effectiveness and reliability. This survey aims to provide researchers and
practitioners with a systematic understanding of self-evolving AI agents,
laying the foundation for the development of more adaptive, autonomous, and
lifelong agentic systems.

Conclusion: 约束建模任务需要通用编码工具和提示编码的领域知识，而非专用代理架构或预定义流程。

Abstract: Translating natural language problem descriptions into formal constraint
models remains a fundamental challenge in constraint programming, requiring
deep expertise in both the problem domain and modeling frameworks. Previous
approaches to automating this translation have employed fixed workflows with
predetermined modeling steps, failing on a significant number of benchmark
problems. We present a new approach using a pure agentic strategy without any
fixed pipeline. We developed a general-purpose Python coding agent based on the
ReAct (Reason and Act) principle, utilizing a persistent IPython kernel for
stateful code execution and iterative development. Rather than embedding
constraint programming logic into the agent architecture, domain-specific
expertise is injected solely through a carefully crafted project prompt. The
agent combines this prompt-encoded knowledge with access to file operations and
code execution tools, enabling it to test hypotheses, debug failures, and
verify solutions dynamically. Implemented in just a few hundred lines of code,
this architecture successfully solves all 101 problems of the CP-Bench
constraint programming benchmark set. The results suggest that constraint
modeling tasks require the combination of general coding tools and domain
expertise encoded in prompts, rather than specialized agent architectures or
predefined workflows.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了首个无需微调或专门训练即可让本地大型语言模型（LLM）玩完整版《外交》游戏的评估工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 《外交》游戏状态复杂且信息密集，以往研究需前沿LLM或微调，限制了研究。

Method: 通过数据驱动迭代优化文本游戏状态表示，使24B模型无需微调即可完成比赛，并开发工具支持假设测试和统计分析。

Result: 实验表明，较大模型表现最佳，但较小模型也能胜任；还提出了关键状态分析协议。

Conclusion: 该工具消除了微调需求，为LLM战略推理能力评估提供了新方法，并揭示了这些能力的自然涌现。

Abstract: We present the first evaluation harness that enables any out-of-the-box,
local, Large Language Models (LLMs) to play full-press Diplomacy without
fine-tuning or specialized training. Previous work required frontier LLMs, or
fine-tuning, due to the high complexity and information density of Diplomacy's
game state. Combined with the high variance of matches, these factors made
Diplomacy prohibitive for study. In this work, we used data-driven iteration to
optimize a textual game state representation such that a 24B model can reliably
complete matches without any fine tuning. We develop tooling to facilitate
hypothesis testing and statistical analysis, and we present case studies on
persuasion, aggressive playstyles, and performance across a range of models. We
conduct a variety of experiments across many popular LLMs, finding the larger
models perform the best, but the smaller models still play adequately. We also
introduce Critical State Analysis: an experimental protocol for rapidly
iterating and analyzing key moments in a game at depth. Our harness
democratizes the evaluation of strategic reasoning in LLMs by eliminating the
need for fine-tuning, and it provides insights into how these capabilities
emerge naturally from widely used LLMs. Our code is available in the supplement
and will be open sourced.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估LLMs和AI Agents使用MCP工具的能力存在数据集不全面、响应格式多样、工具调用成功率不稳定以及上下文窗口限制等问题。

Method: 提出MCPToolBench++基准，基于超过4k个MCP服务器和40多个类别的数据集，涵盖单步和多步工具调用。

Result: 在基准上评估了具有代理能力的SOTA LLMs，并报告了结果。

Conclusion: MCPToolBench++为评估LLMs在MCP工具调用中的性能提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: LLMs' capabilities are enhanced by using function calls to integrate various
data sources or API results into the context window. Typical tools include
search, web crawlers, maps, financial data, file systems, and browser usage,
etc. Integrating these data sources or functions requires a standardized
method. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way to supply
context to LLMs. However, the evaluation of LLMs and AI Agents' MCP tool use
abilities suffer from several issues. First, there's a lack of comprehensive
datasets or benchmarks to evaluate various MCP tools. Second, the diverse
formats of response from MCP tool call execution further increase the
difficulty of evaluation. Additionally, unlike existing tool-use benchmarks
with high success rates in functions like programming and math functions, the
success rate of real-world MCP tool is not guaranteed and varies across
different MCP servers. Furthermore, the LLMs' context window also limits the
number of available tools that can be called in a single run, because the
textual descriptions of tool and the parameters have long token length for an
LLM to process all at once. To help address the challenges of evaluating LLMs'
performance on calling MCP tools, we propose MCPToolBench++, a large-scale,
multi-domain AI Agent tool use benchmark. As of July 2025, this benchmark is
build upon marketplace of over 4k MCP servers from more than 40 categories,
collected from the MCP marketplaces and GitHub communities. The datasets
consist of both single-step and multi-step tool calls across different
categories. We evaluated SOTA LLMs with agentic abilities on this benchmark and
reported the results.

Conclusion: 提出的框架和算法有效提升了语义通信的隐私性和传输质量，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, a novel covert semantic communication framework is
investigated. Within this framework, a server extracts and transmits the
semantic information, i.e., the meaning of image data, to a user over several
time slots. An attacker seeks to detect and eavesdrop the semantic transmission
to acquire details of the original image. To avoid data meaning being
eavesdropped by an attacker, a friendly jammer is deployed to transmit jamming
signals to interfere the attacker so as to hide the transmitted semantic
information. Meanwhile, the server will strategically select time slots for
semantic information transmission. Due to limited energy, the jammer will not
communicate with the server and hence the server does not know the transmit
power of the jammer. Therefore, the server must jointly optimize the semantic
information transmitted at each time slot and the corresponding transmit power
to maximize the privacy and the semantic information transmission quality of
the user. To solve this problem, we propose a prioritised sampling assisted
twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to jointly determine
the transmitted semantic information and the transmit power per time slot
without the communications between the server and the jammer. Compared to
standard reinforcement learning methods, the propose method uses an additional
Q network to estimate Q values such that the agent can select the action with a
lower Q value from the two Q networks thus avoiding local optimal action
selection and estimation bias of Q values. Simulation results show that the
proposed algorithm can improve the privacy and the semantic information
transmission quality by up to 77.8% and 14.3% compared to the traditional
reinforcement learning methods.

Motivation: 解决LLM在大规模工具库中选择工具时因上下文限制和噪声导致的低准确性和高计算成本问题。

Method: HGMF分两阶段：先聚类服务器并基于查询概率筛选，再对关联工具进行相同操作，生成高相关性候选集。

Result: 实验表明HGMF显著提高工具选择准确性并降低推理延迟。

Conclusion: HGMF是一种可扩展且高效的工具调用框架，适用于大规模工具库。

Abstract: Invoking external tools enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform
complex, real-world tasks, yet selecting the correct tool from large,
hierarchically-structured libraries remains a significant challenge. The
limited context windows of LLMs and noise from irrelevant options often lead to
low selection accuracy and high computational costs. To address this, we
propose the Hierarchical Gaussian Mixture Framework (HGMF), a probabilistic
pruning method for scalable tool invocation. HGMF first maps the user query and
all tool descriptions into a unified semantic space. The framework then
operates in two stages: it clusters servers using a Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) and filters them based on the query's likelihood. Subsequently, it
applies the same GMM-based clustering and filtering to the tools associated
with the selected servers. This hierarchical process produces a compact,
high-relevance candidate set, simplifying the final selection task for the LLM.
Experiments on a public dataset show that HGMF significantly improves tool
selection accuracy while reducing inference latency, confirming the framework's
scalability and effectiveness for large-scale tool libraries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现强化学习（RL）无法真正赋予模型新的推理能力，仅能挖掘已有行为，因此探索如何训练不具备此类行为的模型。

Method: 采用GRPO基础的交互式训练方法，教师模型通过反馈指导学生模型，类似课堂中的问题-尝试-反馈模式。

Result: ThinkTuning在多个基准上平均提升3.85%，在MATH-500、AIME和GPQA-Diamond上分别提升2.08%、2.23%和3.99%。

Conclusion: 通过教师模型的隐式监督反馈，学生模型的推理能力得到显著提升，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in test-time scaling have led to the emergence of thinking
LLMs that exhibit self-reflective behaviors and multi-step reasoning. While RL
drives this self-improvement paradigm, a recent study (Gandhi et al., 2025)
shows that RL alone does not truly instill these new reasoning abilities - it
merely draws out behaviors already present in the base models. This raises a
question: How can we train the models that don't exhibit such thinking behavior
to develop it in the first place? To this end, we propose ThinkTuning, a
GRPO-based interactive training approach where we augment the rollouts of a
student model with the guidance from a teacher model. A simple idea from
classroom practice inspires our method: a teacher poses a problem, lets the
student try an answer, then gives corrective feedback -- enough to point the
mind in the right direction and then show the solution. Each piece of feedback
reshapes the student's thoughts, leading them to arrive at the correct
solution. Similarly, we find that this type of implicit supervision through
feedback from a teacher model of the same size improves the reasoning
capabilities of the student model. In particular, on average, our method shows
a 3.85% improvement over zero-shot baselines across benchmarks, and on
MATH-500, AIME and GPQA-Diamond it shows 2.08%, 2.23% and 3.99% improvements
over the vanilla-GRPO baseline. Source code is available at

Motivation: 传统蛋鸡福利监测依赖主观、劳动密集型方法，无法全面捕捉现代养殖场的复杂需求。多模态AI为解决这一问题提供了新思路。

Method: 采用多模态AI整合视觉、声学、环境和生理数据，提出特征级融合策略，并引入DTS和DRI评估工具及模块化部署框架。

Result: 特征级融合策略在鲁棒性和性能上表现最佳，新工具和框架提升了模型适应性和数据可靠性。

Conclusion: 研究为从被动单模态监测转向主动、精准驱动的福利系统奠定了基础，结合生产效率和科学化动物福利。

Abstract: The future of poultry production depends on a paradigm shift replacing
subjective, labor-intensive welfare checks with data-driven, intelligent
monitoring ecosystems. Traditional welfare assessments-limited by human
observation and single-sensor data-cannot fully capture the complex,
multidimensional nature of laying hen welfare in modern farms. Multimodal
Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a breakthrough, integrating visual,
acoustic, environmental, and physiological data streams to reveal deeper
insights into avian welfare dynamics. This investigation highlights multimodal
As transformative potential, showing that intermediate (feature-level) fusion
strategies achieve the best balance between robustness and performance under
real-world poultry conditions, and offer greater scalability than early or late
fusion approaches. Key adoption barriers include sensor fragility in harsh farm
environments, high deployment costs, inconsistent behavioral definitions, and
limited cross-farm generalizability. To address these, we introduce two novel
evaluation tools - the Domain Transfer Score (DTS) to measure model
adaptability across diverse farm settings, and the Data Reliability Index (DRI)
to assess sensor data quality under operational constraints. We also propose a
modular, context-aware deployment framework designed for laying hen
environments, enabling scalable and practical integration of multimodal
sensing. This work lays the foundation for a transition from reactive, unimodal
monitoring to proactive, precision-driven welfare systems that unite
productivity with ethical, science based animal care.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLN方法在复杂空间和时间推理场景中泛化能力不足，需要更结构化的解决方案。

Method: SkillNav将导航任务分解为原子技能（如垂直移动、区域识别等），每个技能由专门代理处理，并使用VLM路由器动态选择代理。

Result: 在R2R和GSA-R2R基准测试中取得最优性能，展示了强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SkillNav通过模块化和技能分解显著提升了VLN任务的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) poses significant challenges in enabling
agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate complex 3D
environments. While recent progress has been driven by large-scale pre-training
and data augmentation, current methods still struggle to generalize to unseen
scenarios, particularly when complex spatial and temporal reasoning is
required. In this work, we propose SkillNav, a modular framework that
introduces structured, skill-based reasoning into Transformer-based VLN agents.
Our method decomposes navigation into a set of interpretable atomic skills
(e.g., Vertical Movement, Area and Region Identification, Stop and Pause), each
handled by a specialized agent. We then introduce a novel zero-shot
Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based router, which dynamically selects the most
suitable agent at each time step by aligning sub-goals with visual observations
and historical actions. SkillNav achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on
the R2R benchmark and demonstrates strong generalization to the GSA-R2R
benchmark that includes novel instruction styles and unseen environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将时空转换分开建模，导致关键节点表示不一致，增加了冗余信息和模型不确定性。

Method: 使用解耦变分多图自编码器（DAE），分离共享和私有分布，通过PoE机制融合共享特征，对比约束去噪私有特征。

Result: 在两个数据集上，DiMuST在多项指标上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiMuST能有效捕捉POI的时空转换表示，同时保持其时空关系的内在相关性。

Abstract: Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is a research hotspot in business
intelligence, where users' spatial-temporal transitions and social
relationships play key roles. However, most existing works model spatial and
temporal transitions separately, leading to misaligned representations of the
same spatial-temporal key nodes. This misalignment introduces redundant
information during fusion, increasing model uncertainty and reducing
interpretability. To address this issue, we propose DiMuST, a socially enhanced
POI recommendation model based on disentangled representation learning over
multiplex spatial-temporal transition graphs. The model employs a novel
Disentangled variational multiplex graph Auto-Encoder (DAE), which first
disentangles shared and private distributions using a multiplex
spatial-temporal graph strategy. It then fuses the shared features via a
Product of Experts (PoE) mechanism and denoises the private features through
contrastive constraints. The model effectively captures the spatial-temporal
transition representations of POIs while preserving the intrinsic correlation
of their spatial-temporal relationships. Experiments on two challenging
datasets demonstrate that our DiMuST significantly outperforms existing methods
across multiple metrics.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在多源信息处理（如混合私人和公共信息的会议摘要）中的上下文隐私问题。

Method: 引入多智能体框架，将隐私推理分解为专门子任务（提取、分类），并通过迭代验证减少隐私错误。

Result: 在ConfAIde和PrivacyLens基准测试中，最佳多智能体配置显著减少了隐私信息泄露（GPT-4o下分别降低18%和19%），同时保持了公共内容的保真度。

Conclusion: 多智能体系统的信息流设计在LLMs的上下文隐私保护中具有潜力。

Abstract: Addressing contextual privacy concerns remains challenging in interactive
settings where large language models (LLMs) process information from multiple
sources (e.g., summarizing meetings with private and public information). We
introduce a multi-agent framework that decomposes privacy reasoning into
specialized subtasks (extraction, classification), reducing the information
load on any single agent while enabling iterative validation and more reliable
adherence to contextual privacy norms. To understand how privacy errors emerge
and propagate, we conduct a systematic ablation over information-flow
topologies, revealing when and why upstream detection mistakes cascade into
downstream leakage. Experiments on the ConfAIde and PrivacyLens benchmark with
several open-source and closed-sourced LLMs demonstrate that our best
multi-agent configuration substantially reduces private information leakage
(\textbf{18\%} on ConfAIde and \textbf{19\%} on PrivacyLens with GPT-4o) while
preserving the fidelity of public content, outperforming single-agent
baselines. These results highlight the promise of principled information-flow
design in multi-agent systems for contextual privacy with LLMs.

Method: 基于Kegan的建构发展理论，EMPATHIA分为SEED、RISE和THRIVE三个模块，使用多智能体透明决策。

Result: 在UN Kakuma数据集上验证，87.4%的收敛率，并在五个接收国实现可解释的评估。

Conclusion: EMPATHIA通过平衡多元价值系统，为AI驱动的分配任务提供了可推广的框架。

Abstract: Current AI approaches to refugee integration optimize narrow objectives such
as employment and fail to capture the cultural, emotional, and ethical
dimensions critical for long-term success. We introduce EMPATHIA (Enriched
Multimodal Pathways for Agentic Thinking in Humanitarian Immigrant Assistance),
a multi-agent framework addressing the central Creative AI question: how do we
preserve human dignity when machines participate in life-altering decisions?
Grounded in Kegan's Constructive Developmental Theory, EMPATHIA decomposes
integration into three modules: SEED (Socio-cultural Entry and Embedding
Decision) for initial placement, RISE (Rapid Integration and Self-sufficiency
Engine) for early independence, and THRIVE (Transcultural Harmony and
Resilience through Integrated Values and Engagement) for sustained outcomes.
SEED employs a selector-validator architecture with three specialized agents -
emotional, cultural, and ethical - that deliberate transparently to produce
interpretable recommendations. Experiments on the UN Kakuma dataset (15,026
individuals, 7,960 eligible adults 15+ per ILO/UNHCR standards) and
implementation on 6,359 working-age refugees (15+) with 150+ socioeconomic
variables achieved 87.4% validation convergence and explainable assessments
across five host countries. EMPATHIA's weighted integration of cultural,
emotional, and ethical factors balances competing value systems while
supporting practitioner-AI collaboration. By augmenting rather than replacing
human expertise, EMPATHIA provides a generalizable framework for AI-driven
allocation tasks where multiple values must be reconciled.

Motivation: AI系统的伦理价值对齐问题复杂，尤其是涉及不可公度的价值时（如生命价值与治疗成本）。需要一种方法将这些价值量化并比较。

Method: 扩展Anything2vec方法，将AI决策策略映射为多变量向量表示，用于评估与人类价值观的对齐。以二元决策和自动驾驶控制为例说明。

Result: 提出Ethics2Vec方法，成功将伦理价值量化，并展示其在二元决策和自动控制中的适用性。

Conclusion: Ethics2Vec为AI伦理对齐提供了一种可行的量化方法，未来可扩展到更复杂场景。

Abstract: Though intelligent agents are supposed to improve human experience (or make
it more efficient), it is hard from a human perspective to grasp the ethical
values which are explicitly or implicitly embedded in an agent behaviour. This
is the well-known problem of alignment, which refers to the challenge of
designing AI systems that align with human values, goals and preferences. This
problem is particularly challenging since most human ethical considerations
refer to \emph{incommensurable} (i.e. non-measurable and/or incomparable)
values and criteria. Consider, for instance, a medical agent prescribing a
treatment to a cancerous patient. How could it take into account (and/or weigh)
incommensurable aspects like the value of a human life and the cost of the
treatment? Now, the alignment between human and artificial values is possible
only if we define a common space where a metric can be defined and used. This
paper proposes to extend to ethics the conventional Anything2vec approach,
which has been successful in plenty of similar and hard-to-quantify domains
(ranging from natural language processing to recommendation systems and graph
analysis). This paper proposes a way to map an automatic agent decision-making
(or control law) strategy to a multivariate vector representation, which can be
used to compare and assess the alignment with human values. The Ethics2Vec
method is first introduced in the case of an automatic agent performing binary
decision-making. Then, a vectorisation of an automatic control law (like in the
case of a self-driving car) is discussed to show how the approach can be
extended to automatic control settings.

Motivation: Transformer在自动规划领域的应用受限，主要由于其对问题对称性的处理不足，导致难以从简单问题推广到复杂问题。

Method: 通过结合对比学习目标和架构改进，训练Transformer以生成规划或预测启发式。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多领域规划任务中有效解决了PlanGPT的局限性。

Conclusion: 对称感知训练显著提升了Transformer在自动规划任务中的性能。

Abstract: While transformers excel in many settings, their application in the field of
automated planning is limited. Prior work like PlanGPT, a state-of-the-art
decoder-only transformer, struggles with extrapolation from easy to hard
planning problems. This in turn stems from problem symmetries: planning tasks
can be represented with arbitrary variable names that carry no meaning beyond
being identifiers. This causes a combinatorial explosion of equivalent
representations that pure transformers cannot efficiently learn from. We
propose a novel contrastive learning objective to make transformers
symmetry-aware and thereby compensate for their lack of inductive bias.
Combining this with architectural improvements, we show that transformers can
be efficiently trained for either plan-generation or heuristic-prediction. Our
results across multiple planning domains demonstrate that our symmetry-aware
training effectively and efficiently addresses the limitations of PlanGPT.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了鲁棒马尔可夫决策过程（RMDPs）中的最优策略选择问题，提出了一种新的策略选择标准——最优鲁棒最佳努力（ORBE）策略，以在非完全对抗性概率下最大化期望回报。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在RMDPs中，存在多个最优鲁棒策略，这些策略在最坏情况下表现相同，但在非对抗性概率下的期望回报不同。因此，需要一种更精细的策略选择标准来区分这些策略。

Method: 论文提出了ORBE策略的概念，结合了博弈论中的优势和最佳努力思想，要求策略不仅在最坏情况下表现最优，还要在非对抗性概率下最大化期望回报。并给出了计算ORBE策略的算法。

Result: 证明了ORBE策略的存在性，并分析了其结构。提出的算法计算ORBE策略的开销仅略高于标准鲁棒值迭代。数值实验验证了方法的可行性。

Conclusion: ORBE策略为RMDPs中的最优鲁棒策略提供了一种原则性的选择标准，能够在非对抗性概率下进一步提升性能。

Abstract: We study the common generalization of Markov decision processes (MDPs) with
sets of transition probabilities, known as robust MDPs (RMDPs). A standard goal
in RMDPs is to compute a policy that maximizes the expected return under an
adversarial choice of the transition probabilities. If the uncertainty in the
probabilities is independent between the states, known as s-rectangularity,
such optimal robust policies can be computed efficiently using robust value
iteration. However, there might still be multiple optimal robust policies,
which, while equivalent with respect to the worst-case, reflect different
expected returns under non-adversarial choices of the transition probabilities.
Hence, we propose a refined policy selection criterion for RMDPs, drawing
inspiration from the notions of dominance and best-effort in game theory.
Instead of seeking a policy that only maximizes the worst-case expected return,
we additionally require the policy to achieve a maximal expected return under
different (i.e., not fully adversarial) transition probabilities. We call such
a policy an optimal robust best-effort (ORBE) policy. We prove that ORBE
policies always exist, characterize their structure, and present an algorithm
to compute them with a small overhead compared to standard robust value
iteration. ORBE policies offer a principled tie-breaker among optimal robust
policies. Numerical experiments show the feasibility of our approach.

Conclusion: 该知识管理系统可优化急救治疗，提升救援效率。

Abstract: Over the years, the need for rescue operations throughout the world has
increased rapidly. Demographic changes and the resulting risk of injury or
health disorders form the basis for emergency calls. In such scenarios, first
responders are in a rush to reach the patient in need, provide first aid, and
save lives. In these situations, they must be able to provide personalized and
optimized healthcare in the shortest possible time and estimate the patients
condition with the help of freshly recorded vital data in an emergency
situation. However, in such a timedependent situation, first responders and
medical experts cannot fully grasp their knowledge and need assistance and
recommendation for further medical treatments. To achieve this, on the spot
calculated, evaluated, and processed knowledge must be made available to
improve treatments by first responders. The Knowledge Graph presented in this
article as a central knowledge representation provides first responders with an
innovative knowledge management that enables intelligent treatment
recommendations with an artificial intelligence-based pre-recognition of the

*Yi Zhai,Zhiqiang Wei,Ruohan Li,Keyu Pan,Shuo Liu,Lu Zhang,Jianmin Ji,Wuyang Zhang,Yu Zhang,Yanyong Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为X-evolve的新方法，通过演化解空间而非单个解，显著减少了LLM调用成本，并在多个优化问题上取得了突破性成果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前结合LLM和EA的方法通常演化单个解，导致LLM调用成本高，限制了复杂优化问题的解决效率。

Method: X-evolve通过LLM生成可调程序，定义可调解空间，并利用基于分数的搜索算法高效探索该空间。

Result: 在三个优化问题上取得显著成果：发现更大的部分可容许集（cap set问题）、更大的独立集（信息论问题）以及更优的启发式算法（装箱问题）。

Conclusion: X-evolve通过演化解空间显著提升了搜索效率，解决了以往计算成本过高的问题。

Abstract: While combining large language models (LLMs) with evolutionary algorithms
(EAs) shows promise for solving complex optimization problems, current
approaches typically evolve individual solutions, often incurring high LLM call
costs. We introduce \(X\)-evolve, a paradigm-shifting method that instead
evolves solution spaces \(X\) (sets of individual solutions) - subsets of the
overall search space \(S\). In \(X\)-evolve, LLMs generate tunable programs
wherein certain code snippets, designated as parameters, define a tunable
solution space. A score-based search algorithm then efficiently explores this
parametrically defined space, guided by feedback from objective function
scores. This strategy enables broader and more efficient exploration, which can
potentially accelerate convergence at a much lower search cost, requiring up to
two orders of magnitude fewer LLM calls than prior leading methods. We
demonstrate \(X\)-evolve's efficacy across three distinct hard optimization
problems. For the cap set problem, we discover a larger partial admissible set,
establishing a new tighter asymptotic lower bound for the cap set constant (\(C
\ge 2.2203\)). In information theory, we uncover a larger independent set for
the 15-vertex cycle graph (\(\mathcal{C}_{15}^{\boxtimes 5}\), size 19,946),
thereby raising the known lower bound on its Shannon capacity. Furthermore, for
the NP-hard online bin packing problem, we generate heuristics that
consistently outperform standard strategies across established benchmarks. By
evolving solution spaces, our method considerably improves search
effectiveness, making it possible to tackle high-dimensional problems that were
previously computationally prohibitive.

*Olivier Poulet,Frédéric Guinand,François Guérin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LSTM短期预测的碰撞风险预判方法，通过动态调整DQN的奖励减少碰撞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无通信和标识的受限环境中，机器人运动易发生碰撞，需一种低成本且高效的风险预判方法。

Method: 使用LSTM模型预测机器人位置，动态调整DQN的奖励以预判碰撞风险。

Result: 在1 Hz采样频率下，碰撞次数显著减少，运动稳定性提高。

Conclusion: 该方法计算成本低，适合嵌入式系统实现。

Abstract: This article proposes a collision risk anticipation method based on
short-term prediction of the agents position. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
model, trained on past trajectories, is used to estimate the next position of
each robot. This prediction allows us to define an anticipated collision risk
by dynamically modulating the reward of a Deep Q-Learning Network (DQN) agent.
The approach is tested in a constrained environment, where two robots move
without communication or identifiers. Despite a limited sampling frequency (1
Hz), the results show a significant decrease of the collisions number and a
stability improvement. The proposed method, which is computationally
inexpensive, appears particularly attractive for implementation on embedded
systems.

Abstract: Forensic cause-of-death determination faces systemic challenges, including
workforce shortages and diagnostic variability, particularly in high-volume
systems like China's medicolegal infrastructure. We introduce FEAT (ForEnsic
AgenT), a multi-agent AI framework that automates and standardizes death
investigations through a domain-adapted large language model. FEAT's
application-oriented architecture integrates: (i) a central Planner for task
decomposition, (ii) specialized Local Solvers for evidence analysis, (iii) a
Memory & Reflection module for iterative refinement, and (iv) a Global Solver
for conclusion synthesis. The system employs tool-augmented reasoning,
hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation, forensic-tuned LLMs, and
human-in-the-loop feedback to ensure legal and medical validity. In evaluations
across diverse Chinese case cohorts, FEAT outperformed state-of-the-art AI
systems in both long-form autopsy analyses and concise cause-of-death
conclusions. It demonstrated robust generalization across six geographic
regions and achieved high expert concordance in blinded validations. Senior
pathologists validated FEAT's outputs as comparable to those of human experts,
with improved detection of subtle evidentiary nuances. To our knowledge, FEAT
is the first LLM-based AI agent system dedicated to forensic medicine, offering
scalable, consistent death certification while maintaining expert-level rigor.
By integrating AI efficiency with human oversight, this work could advance
equitable access to reliable medicolegal services while addressing critical
capacity constraints in forensic systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于LLM的、不确定性感知的框架，用于解析美联储的‘Fedspeak’语言并分类其货币政策立场，结合领域特定推理和动态不确定性解码模块，显著提升了分类准确性和模型可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美联储的‘Fedspeak’语言隐含政策信号，解析其立场对金融预测和算法交易具有重要影响。

Method: 采用LLM框架，结合货币政策传导机制的领域特定推理，并引入动态不确定性解码模块评估预测置信度。

Result: 实验表明该框架在政策立场分析任务上达到最优性能，且感知不确定性与模型错误率显著正相关。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了Fedspeak的解析能力，感知不确定性可作为诊断信号验证模型可靠性。

Abstract: "Fedspeak", the stylized and often nuanced language used by the U.S. Federal
Reserve, encodes implicit policy signals and strategic stances. The Federal
Open Market Committee strategically employs Fedspeak as a communication tool to
shape market expectations and influence both domestic and global economic
conditions. As such, automatically parsing and interpreting Fedspeak presents a
high-impact challenge, with significant implications for financial forecasting,
algorithmic trading, and data-driven policy analysis. In this paper, we propose
an LLM-based, uncertainty-aware framework for deciphering Fedspeak and
classifying its underlying monetary policy stance. Technically, to enrich the
semantic and contextual representation of Fedspeak texts, we incorporate
domain-specific reasoning grounded in the monetary policy transmission
mechanism. We further introduce a dynamic uncertainty decoding module to assess
the confidence of model predictions, thereby enhancing both classification
accuracy and model reliability. Experimental results demonstrate that our
framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the policy stance analysis
task. Moreover, statistical analysis reveals a significant positive correlation
between perceptual uncertainty and model error rates, validating the
effectiveness of perceptual uncertainty as a diagnostic signal.

Motivation: 研究如何通过正负例拟合出满足条件（正例成立，负例不成立）的本体，以支持本体介导查询的优化。

Method: 使用描述逻辑ALC和ALCI作为本体语言，分析原子查询（AQs）、联合查询（CQs）及其组合（UCQs）的拟合问题。

Conclusion: 研究为不同查询语言下的本体拟合问题提供了理论支持，揭示了其计算复杂度的差异。

Abstract: We study a fitting problem inspired by ontology-mediated querying: given a
collection
  of positive and negative examples of
  the form $(\mathcal{A},q)$ with
  $\mathcal{A}$ an ABox and $q$ a Boolean query, we seek
  an ontology $\mathcal{O}$ that satisfies $\mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{O} \vDash
q$ for all positive examples and $\mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{O}\not\vDash q$ for
all negative examples.
  We consider the description logics $\mathcal{ALC}$ and $\mathcal{ALCI}$ as
ontology languages and
  a range of query languages that
  includes atomic queries (AQs), conjunctive queries (CQs), and unions thereof
(UCQs).
  For all of the resulting fitting problems,
  we provide
  effective characterizations and determine the computational complexity
  of deciding whether a fitting ontology exists. This problem turns out to be
${\small CO}NP$ for AQs and full CQs
  and $2E{\small XP}T{\small IME}$-complete for CQs and UCQs.
  These results hold for both $\mathcal{ALC}$ and $\mathcal{ALCI}$.

Motivation: 现有基于静态模板或手动设计的工作流方法适应性差且难以扩展，需要更灵活的解决方案。

Result: 在问答、代码生成和数学推理任务中表现优异，优于手动和自动基线方法。

Conclusion: AdaptFlow通过语言引导的修改实现强泛化能力，适用于多种任务和模型。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest
in agentic workflows, which are structured sequences of LLM invocations
intended to solve complex tasks. However, existing approaches often rely on
static templates or manually designed workflows, which limit adaptability to
diverse tasks and hinder scalability. We propose AdaptFlow, a natural
language-based meta-learning framework inspired by model-agnostic meta-learning
(MAML). AdaptFlow learns a generalizable workflow initialization that enables
rapid subtask-level adaptation. It employs a bi-level optimization scheme: the
inner loop refines the workflow for a specific subtask using LLM-generated
feedback, while the outer loop updates the shared initialization to perform
well across tasks. This setup allows AdaptFlow to generalize effectively to
unseen tasks by adapting the initialized workflow through language-guided
modifications. Evaluated across question answering, code generation, and
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, AdaptFlow consistently outperforms both
manually crafted and automatically searched baselines, achieving
state-of-the-art results with strong generalization across tasks and models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Dempster-Shafer理论的开放世界信息融合方法（FNBT），通过扩展框架和全否定机制解决异构框架下的信息融合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中，数据或模型常来自不同区域或组织，导致异构框架，传统融合方法效果不佳。

Method: 提出FNBT方法，引入标准判断开放世界任务，扩展框架以容纳异构元素，并通过全否定机制转换质量函数。

Result: 理论证明FNBT满足质量函数不变性、遗传性和冲突消除性，实验显示其在分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: FNBT有效解决了异构框架下的信息融合问题，并在实际应用中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence has been widely applied in the field
of information fusion under uncertainty. Most existing research focuses on
combining evidence within the same frame of discernment. However, in real-world
scenarios, trained algorithms or data often originate from different regions or
organizations, where data silos are prevalent. As a result, using different
data sources or models to generate basic probability assignments may lead to
heterogeneous frames, for which traditional fusion methods often yield
unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, this study proposes an
open-world information fusion method, termed Full Negation Belief
Transformation (FNBT), based on the Dempster-Shafer theory. More specially, a
criterion is introduced to determine whether a given fusion task belongs to the
open-world setting. Then, by extending the frames, the method can accommodate
elements from heterogeneous frames. Finally, a full negation mechanism is
employed to transform the mass functions, so that existing combination rules
can be applied to the transformed mass functions for such information fusion.
Theoretically, the proposed method satisfies three desirable properties, which
are formally proven: mass function invariance, heritability, and essential
conflict elimination. Empirically, FNBT demonstrates superior performance in
pattern classification tasks on real-world datasets and successfully resolves
Zadeh's counterexample, thereby validating its practical effectiveness.

Result: 在7/8的数据集上表现提升，并通过消融实验揭示了不同任务的最优团队配置。

Conclusion: TeamMedAgents为关键决策领域的多智能体系统设计提供了理论基础和实践验证。

Abstract: We present TeamMedAgents, a novel multi-agent approach that systematically
integrates evidence-based teamwork components from human-human collaboration
into medical decision-making with large language models (LLMs). Our approach
validates an organizational psychology teamwork model from human collaboration
to computational multi-agent medical systems by operationalizing six core
teamwork components derived from Salas et al.'s "Big Five" model: team
leadership, mutual performance monitoring, team orientation, shared mental
models, closed-loop communication, and mutual trust. We implement and evaluate
these components as modular, configurable mechanisms within an adaptive
collaboration architecture while assessing the effect of the number of agents
involved based on the task's requirements and domain. Systematic evaluation of
computational implementations of teamwork behaviors across eight medical
benchmarks (MedQA, MedMCQA, MMLU-Pro Medical, PubMedQA, DDXPlus, MedBullets,
Path-VQA, and PMC-VQA) demonstrates consistent improvements across 7 out of 8
evaluated datasets. Controlled ablation studies conducted on 50 questions per
configuration across 3 independent runs provide mechanistic insights into
individual component contributions, revealing optimal teamwork configurations
that vary by reasoning task complexity and domain-specific requirements. Our
ablation analyses reveal dataset-specific optimal teamwork configurations,
indicating that different medical reasoning modalities benefit from distinct
collaborative patterns. TeamMedAgents represents an advancement in
collaborative AI by providing a systematic translation of established teamwork
theories from human collaboration into agentic collaboration, establishing a
foundation for evidence-based multi-agent system design in critical
decision-making domains.

Conclusion: BlindGuard为多智能体系统提供了一种实用且通用的无监督防御方案。

Abstract: The security of LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) is critically threatened
by propagation vulnerability, where malicious agents can distort collective
decision-making through inter-agent message interactions. While existing
supervised defense methods demonstrate promising performance, they may be
impractical in real-world scenarios due to their heavy reliance on labeled
malicious agents to train a supervised malicious detection model. To enable
practical and generalizable MAS defenses, in this paper, we propose BlindGuard,
an unsupervised defense method that learns without requiring any
attack-specific labels or prior knowledge of malicious behaviors. To this end,
we establish a hierarchical agent encoder to capture individual, neighborhood,
and global interaction patterns of each agent, providing a comprehensive
understanding for malicious agent detection. Meanwhile, we design a
corruption-guided detector that consists of directional noise injection and
contrastive learning, allowing effective detection model training solely on
normal agent behaviors. Extensive experiments show that BlindGuard effectively
detects diverse attack types (i.e., prompt injection, memory poisoning, and
tool attack) across MAS with various communication patterns while maintaining
superior generalizability compared to supervised baselines. The code is

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Large Language Models (LLMs)-assisted agent
that automatically converts natural-language descriptions of power system
optimization scenarios into compact, solver-ready formulations and generates
corresponding solutions. In contrast to approaches that rely solely on LLM to
produce solutions directly, the proposed method focuses on discovering a
mathematically compatible formulation that can be efficiently solved by
off-the-shelf optimization solvers. Directly using LLMs to produce solutions
often leads to infeasible or suboptimal results, as these models lack the
numerical precision and constraint-handling capabilities of established
optimization solvers. The pipeline integrates a domain-aware prompt and schema
with an LLM, enforces feasibility through systematic validation and iterative
repair, and returns both solver-ready models and user-facing results. Using the
unit commitment problem as a representative case study, the agent produces
optimal or near-optimal schedules along with the associated objective costs.
Results demonstrate that coupling the solver with task-specific validation
significantly enhances solution reliability. This work shows that combining AI
with established optimization frameworks bridges high-level problem
descriptions and executable mathematical models, enabling more efficient
decision-making in energy systems
