### [1] [DrivingScene: A Multi-Task Online Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting Method for Dynamic Driving Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24734)
*Qirui Hou,Wenzhang Sun,Chang Zeng,Chunfeng Wang,Hao Li,Jianxun Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DrivingScene是一个从两帧连续环视图像在线重建4D动态驾驶场景的框架，通过轻量级残差流网络预测动态物体的非刚性运动，在nuScenes数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时高保真重建动态驾驶场景面临复杂动态和稀疏视图的挑战，现有方法难以平衡质量和效率。

Method: 提出轻量级残差流网络在学习的静态场景先验基础上预测动态物体的非刚性运动，通过场景流显式建模动态，并采用由粗到精的训练范式避免端到端方法的不稳定性。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，该仅使用图像的方法能在线生成高质量深度、场景流和3D高斯点云，在动态重建和新视角合成方面显著优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: DrivingScene框架成功解决了动态驾驶场景重建中质量与效率的平衡问题，为实时应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time, high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic driving scenes is
challenged by complex dynamics and sparse views, with prior methods struggling
to balance quality and efficiency. We propose DrivingScene, an online,
feed-forward framework that reconstructs 4D dynamic scenes from only two
consecutive surround-view images. Our key innovation is a lightweight residual
flow network that predicts the non-rigid motion of dynamic objects per camera
on top of a learned static scene prior, explicitly modeling dynamics via scene
flow. We also introduce a coarse-to-fine training paradigm that circumvents the
instabilities common to end-to-end approaches. Experiments on nuScenes dataset
show our image-only method simultaneously generates high-quality depth, scene
flow, and 3D Gaussian point clouds online, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in both dynamic reconstruction and novel view
synthesis.

### [2] [Towards Fine-Grained Human Motion Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24767)
*Guorui Song,Guocun Wang,Zhe Huang,Jing Lin,Xuefei Zhe,Jian Li,Haoqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出M-ACM模型，通过运动感知解码增强视频字幕质量，利用人体网格恢复的运动表示来突出人体动态，减少幻觉并提高语义保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频字幕模型难以捕捉细粒度运动细节，导致生成的字幕模糊或语义不一致。

Method: 引入运动增强字幕模型(M-ACM)，利用人体网格恢复得到的运动表示，通过运动感知解码机制来显式突出人体动态。

Result: 实验结果表明M-ACM在准确描述复杂人体运动和细微时间变化方面显著优于先前方法。

Conclusion: M-ACM为运动中心视频字幕设定了新标准，同时发布了HMI数据集和HMI-Bench基准来支持该领域研究。

Abstract: Generating accurate descriptions of human actions in videos remains a
challenging task for video captioning models. Existing approaches often
struggle to capture fine-grained motion details, resulting in vague or
semantically inconsistent captions. In this work, we introduce the
Motion-Augmented Caption Model (M-ACM), a novel generative framework that
enhances caption quality by incorporating motion-aware decoding. At its core,
M-ACM leverages motion representations derived from human mesh recovery to
explicitly highlight human body dynamics, thereby reducing hallucinations and
improving both semantic fidelity and spatial alignment in the generated
captions. To support research in this area, we present the Human Motion Insight
(HMI) Dataset, comprising 115K video-description pairs focused on human
movement, along with HMI-Bench, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating
motion-focused video captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that M-ACM
significantly outperforms previous methods in accurately describing complex
human motions and subtle temporal variations, setting a new standard for
motion-centric video captioning.

### [3] [Combining SAR Simulators to Train ATR Models with Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24768)
*Benjamin Camus,Julien Houssay,Corentin Le Barbu,Eric Monteux,Cédric Saleun,Christian Cochin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用两种不同模拟器(MOCEM和Salsa)生成合成SAR图像来训练深度学习模型，以解决自动目标识别(ATR)中真实标注数据缺乏的问题，并在MSTAR数据集上达到近88%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏真实标注的合成孔径雷达(SAR)图像数据，需要利用模拟器生成合成数据来训练深度学习模型。但单一模拟器基于简化的物理模型，无法充分代表真实世界，导致模型泛化能力不足。

Method: 结合两种基于不同物理范式(散射中心模型和光线追踪)的SAR模拟器MOCEM和Salsa生成合成数据集，使用ADASCA深度学习方法来训练ATR模型。

Result: 在MSTAR真实测量数据上达到了接近88%的识别准确率。

Conclusion: 通过结合不同物理基础的模拟器可以生成更全面的合成数据集，有效提升深度学习模型在真实SAR图像上的自动目标识别性能。

Abstract: This work aims to train Deep Learning models to perform Automatic Target
Recognition (ATR) on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. To circumvent the
lack of real labelled measurements, we resort to synthetic data produced by SAR
simulators. Simulation offers full control over the virtual environment, which
enables us to generate large and diversified datasets at will. However,
simulations are intrinsically grounded on simplifying assumptions of the real
world (i.e. physical models). Thus, synthetic datasets are not as
representative as real measurements. Consequently, ATR models trained on
synthetic images cannot generalize well on real measurements. Our contributions
to this problem are twofold: on one hand, we demonstrate and quantify the
impact of the simulation paradigm on the ATR. On the other hand, we propose a
new approach to tackle the ATR problem: combine two SAR simulators that are
grounded on different (but complementary) paradigms to produce synthetic
datasets. To this end, we use two simulators: MOCEM, which is based on a
scattering centers model approach, and Salsa, which resorts on a ray tracing
strategy. We train ATR models using synthetic dataset generated both by MOCEM
and Salsa and our Deep Learning approach called ADASCA. We reach an accuracy of
almost 88 % on the MSTAR measurements.

### [4] [Point-level Uncertainty Evaluation of Mobile Laser Scanning Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24773)
*Ziyang Xu,Olaf Wysocki,Christoph Holst*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于机器学习的移动激光扫描点云不确定性评估框架，使用随机森林和XGBoost模型学习局部几何特征与点级误差的关系，无需高精度参考数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统后向不确定性建模依赖高精度参考数据，成本高且难以大规模获取，需要一种不依赖参考数据的可扩展不确定性评估方法。

Method: 使用随机森林和XGBoost两种集成学习模型，基于局部几何特征预测点级不确定性，采用空间分区数据集避免数据泄露。

Result: 两种模型都能有效捕捉几何特征与不确定性的非线性关系，平均ROC-AUC值超过0.87，高程变化、点密度和局部结构复杂度是主要预测特征。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模点云质量控制和误差分析提供了数据驱动、可扩展和适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Reliable quantification of uncertainty in Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point
clouds is essential for ensuring the accuracy and credibility of downstream
applications such as 3D mapping, modeling, and change analysis. Traditional
backward uncertainty modeling heavily rely on high-precision reference data,
which are often costly or infeasible to obtain at large scales. To address this
issue, this study proposes a machine learning-based framework for point-level
uncertainty evaluation that learns the relationship between local geometric
features and point-level errors. The framework is implemented using two
ensemble learning models, Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost, which are trained and
validated on a spatially partitioned real-world dataset to avoid data leakage.
Experimental results demonstrate that both models can effectively capture the
nonlinear relationships between geometric characteristics and uncertainty,
achieving mean ROC-AUC values above 0.87. The analysis further reveals that
geometric features describing elevation variation, point density, and local
structural complexity play a dominant role in predicting uncertainty. The
proposed framework offers a data-driven perspective of uncertainty evaluation,
providing a scalable and adaptable foundation for future quality control and
error analysis of large-scale point clouds.

### [5] [Cross-Enhanced Multimodal Fusion of Eye-Tracking and Facial Features for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24777)
*Yujie Nie,Jianzhang Ni,Yonglong Ye,Yuan-Ting Zhang,Yun Kwok Wing,Xiangqing Xu,Xin Ma,Lizhou Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态交叉增强融合框架，结合眼动追踪和面部特征进行阿尔茨海默病检测，通过交叉注意力机制和方向感知卷积实现自适应多模态表征学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病的准确诊断对及时干预至关重要，而眼动和面部特征是认知功能的重要指标，但很少有研究探索它们联合用于辅助AD诊断。

Method: 包含两个关键模块：交叉增强融合注意力模块（CEFAM）通过交叉注意力和全局增强建模模态间交互；方向感知卷积模块（DACM）通过水平-垂直感受野捕获细粒度面部特征。

Result: 在包含25名AD患者和25名健康对照的数据集上，该框架优于传统方法，实现了95.11%的分类准确率。

Conclusion: 该框架通过显式建模模态间依赖关系和模态特定贡献，在AD诊断中表现出优越的鲁棒性和诊断性能。

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for enabling
timely intervention and slowing disease progression. Multimodal diagnostic
approaches offer considerable promise by integrating complementary information
across behavioral and perceptual domains. Eye-tracking and facial features, in
particular, are important indicators of cognitive function, reflecting
attentional distribution and neurocognitive state. However, few studies have
explored their joint integration for auxiliary AD diagnosis. In this study, we
propose a multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework that synergistically
leverages eye-tracking and facial features for AD detection. The framework
incorporates two key modules: (a) a Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module
(CEFAM), which models inter-modal interactions through cross-attention and
global enhancement, and (b) a Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM), which
captures fine-grained directional facial features via horizontal-vertical
receptive fields. Together, these modules enable adaptive and discriminative
multimodal representation learning. To support this work, we constructed a
synchronized multimodal dataset, including 25 patients with AD and 25 healthy
controls (HC), by recording aligned facial video and eye-tracking sequences
during a visual memory-search paradigm, providing an ecologically valid
resource for evaluating integration strategies. Extensive experiments on this
dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional late fusion and
feature concatenation methods, achieving a classification accuracy of 95.11% in
distinguishing AD from HC, highlighting superior robustness and diagnostic
performance by explicitly modeling inter-modal dependencies and
modality-specific contributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能车辆自动化趋势中，车道路径检测是关键应用需求，需要高效实时的检测系统。

Method: 基于FPGA硬件平台，采用Sobel边缘检测算法处理416x416分辨率图像，运行频率150MHz，集成自动光照和温度控制单元。

Result: 系统每1.17ms生成有效输出，包括车道数量、当前车道索引及左右边界信息，适应环境条件变化。

Conclusion: 该FPGA架构为智能车辆提供了高效实时的车道检测解决方案，具有良好的环境适应性。

Abstract: Intelligent vehicles are one of the most important outcomes gained from the
world tendency toward automation. Applications of IVs, whether in urban roads
or robot tracks, do prioritize lane path detection. This paper proposes an
FPGA-based Lane Detector Vehicle LDV architecture that relies on the Sobel
algorithm for edge detection. Operating on 416 x 416 images and 150 MHz, the
system can generate a valid output every 1.17 ms. The valid output consists of
the number of present lanes, the current lane index, as well as its right and
left boundaries. Additionally, the automated light and temperature control
units in the proposed system enhance its adaptability to the surrounding
environmental conditions.

### [7] [ESCA: Enabling Seamless Codec Avatar Execution through Algorithm and Hardware Co-Optimization for Virtual Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24787)
*Mingzhi Zhu,Ding Shang,Sai Qian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ESCA框架，通过后训练量化和定制硬件加速器，在资源受限的VR设备上实现高质量Codec Avatar的实时推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Photorealistic Codec Avatar在VR设备上实时推理时的高计算需求和资源限制问题。

Method: 采用后训练量化方法降低精度，设计定制硬件加速器集成到VR设备SoC中，构建全栈优化框架ESCA。

Result: FovVideoVDP质量得分提升+0.39，延迟降低3.36倍，保持100fps渲染速率，满足实时VR需求。

Conclusion: 证明了在资源受限设备上部署高质量Codec Avatar的可行性，为更沉浸式和便携的VR体验铺平道路。

Abstract: Photorealistic Codec Avatars (PCA), which generate high-fidelity human face
renderings, are increasingly being used in Virtual Reality (VR) environments to
enable immersive communication and interaction through deep learning-based
generative models. However, these models impose significant computational
demands, making real-time inference challenging on resource-constrained VR
devices such as head-mounted displays, where latency and power efficiency are
critical. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient post-training
quantization (PTQ) method tailored for Codec Avatar models, enabling
low-precision execution without compromising output quality. In addition, we
design a custom hardware accelerator that can be integrated into the
system-on-chip of VR devices to further enhance processing efficiency. Building
on these components, we introduce ESCA, a full-stack optimization framework
that accelerates PCA inference on edge VR platforms. Experimental results
demonstrate that ESCA boosts FovVideoVDP quality scores by up to $+0.39$ over
the best 4-bit baseline, delivers up to $3.36\times$ latency reduction, and
sustains a rendering rate of 100 frames per second in end-to-end tests,
satisfying real-time VR requirements. These results demonstrate the feasibility
of deploying high-fidelity codec avatars on resource-constrained devices,
opening the door to more immersive and portable VR experiences.

### [8] [The Underappreciated Power of Vision Models for Graph Structural Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24788)
*Xinjian Zhao,Wei Pang,Zhongkai Xue,Xiangru Jian,Lei Zhang,Yaoyao Xu,Xiaozhuang Song,Shu Wu,Tianshu Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究发现视觉模型在图结构理解方面具有与GNNs相当的性能，但在全局拓扑感知方面表现更优，特别是在需要整体模式识别的任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视觉模型在图理解中的潜力，因为GNNs采用自底向上的消息传递机制，与人类视觉感知先捕捉全局结构的方式存在根本差异。

Method: 引入GraphAbstract基准测试，评估模型感知全局图属性的能力，包括识别组织原型、检测对称性、感知连接强度和识别关键元素。

Result: 视觉模型在需要整体结构理解的任务中显著优于GNNs，且能保持跨不同图尺度的泛化能力，而GNNs在全局模式抽象方面表现不佳且随图规模增大性能下降。

Conclusion: 视觉模型具有显著但未被充分利用的图结构理解能力，特别是在需要全局拓扑感知和尺度不变推理的问题上，为开发更有效的图基础模型开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks operate through bottom-up message-passing,
fundamentally differing from human visual perception, which intuitively
captures global structures first. We investigate the underappreciated potential
of vision models for graph understanding, finding they achieve performance
comparable to GNNs on established benchmarks while exhibiting distinctly
different learning patterns. These divergent behaviors, combined with
limitations of existing benchmarks that conflate domain features with
topological understanding, motivate our introduction of GraphAbstract. This
benchmark evaluates models' ability to perceive global graph properties as
humans do: recognizing organizational archetypes, detecting symmetry, sensing
connectivity strength, and identifying critical elements. Our results reveal
that vision models significantly outperform GNNs on tasks requiring holistic
structural understanding and maintain generalizability across varying graph
scales, while GNNs struggle with global pattern abstraction and degrade with
increasing graph size. This work demonstrates that vision models possess
remarkable yet underutilized capabilities for graph structural understanding,
particularly for problems requiring global topological awareness and
scale-invariant reasoning. These findings open new avenues to leverage this
underappreciated potential for developing more effective graph foundation
models for tasks dominated by holistic pattern recognition.

*Jingjun Bi,Fadi Dornaika*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RSGSLM方法，结合图卷积网络、伪标签和拓扑平衡校正，用于多视图数据的半监督学习


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理缺乏清晰图结构的图像数据和多视图数据时效率有限，且多视图数据的图结构集成仍具挑战

Method: 结合线性特征变换和多视图图融合于GCN框架；动态集成伪标签到GCN损失函数；校正拓扑不平衡；引入无监督平滑损失

Result: 在多视图基准图像数据集上的实验表明，RSGSLM超越了现有的半监督学习方法

Conclusion: RSGSLM通过优化图结构和伪标签集成，在多视图半监督学习中实现了优越性能

Abstract: Recently, graph-based semi-supervised learning and pseudo-labeling have
gained attention due to their effectiveness in reducing the need for extensive
data annotations. Pseudo-labeling uses predictions from unlabeled data to
improve model training, while graph-based methods are characterized by
processing data represented as graphs. However, the lack of clear graph
structures in images combined with the complexity of multi-view data limits the
efficiency of traditional and existing techniques. Moreover, the integration of
graph structures in multi-view data is still a challenge. In this paper, we
propose Re-node Self-taught Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning for Multi-view
Data (RSGSLM). Our method addresses these challenges by (i) combining linear
feature transformation and multi-view graph fusion within a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) framework, (ii) dynamically incorporating pseudo-labels into the
GCN loss function to improve classification in multi-view data, and (iii)
correcting topological imbalances by adjusting the weights of labeled samples
near class boundaries. Additionally, (iv) we introduce an unsupervised
smoothing loss applicable to all samples. This combination optimizes
performance while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results on
multi-view benchmark image datasets demonstrate that RSGSLM surpasses existing
semi-supervised learning approaches in multi-view contexts.

*Patrick Haller,Fabio Barth,Jonas Golde,Georg Rehm,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PISA-Bench是一个多语言视觉语言基准测试，基于专家创建的PISA测试构建，覆盖六种语言，用于评估多模态推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试存在高质量人工验证样本不足、依赖LLM生成内容、主要限于英语等问题，需要填补多语言高质量评估资源的空白。

Method: 从PISA测试中提取人工标注的指令、问题、选项和图像，翻译成五种额外语言，构建完全平行的六语言语料库。

Result: 评估发现小模型(<20B参数)表现不佳，非英语版本性能显著下降，在空间和几何推理任务上错误率高。

Conclusion: PISA-Bench为推进多语言多模态推理研究提供了有价值的资源，揭示了当前模型在多语言和复杂推理任务上的局限性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
multimodal reasoning. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in terms of
high-quality, human-verified examples. Many current datasets rely on
synthetically generated content by large language models (LLMs). Furthermore,
most datasets are limited to English, as manual quality assurance of translated
samples is time-consuming and costly. To fill this gap, we introduce
PISA-Bench, a multilingual benchmark derived from English examples of the
expert-created PISA tests, a unified framework for the assessment of student
competencies in over eighty countries. Each example consists of human-extracted
instructions, questions, answer options, and images, enriched with question
type categories, and has been translated from English into five additional
languages (Spanish, German, Chinese, French, and Italian), resulting in a fully
parallel corpus covering six languages. We evaluate state-of-the-art
vision-language models on PISA-Bench and find that especially small models
(<20B parameters) fail to achieve high test scores. We further find substantial
performance degradation on non-English splits as well as high error-rates when
models are tasked with spatial and geometric reasoning. By releasing the
dataset and evaluation framework, we provide a resource for advancing research
on multilingual multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: 本调查首次全面回顾了高效视觉-语言-动作模型（Efficient VLAs），提出了统一分类法，将现有技术分为高效模型设计、高效训练和高效数据收集三大支柱，旨在解决VLA模型部署中的计算和数据需求挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉-语言-动作模型（VLAs）在具身智能领域具有重要价值，但其部署受到底层大规模基础模型巨大计算和数据需求的严重阻碍，迫切需要解决这些挑战。

Method: 引入统一分类法系统组织该领域的不同努力，将现有技术分为三大核心支柱：高效模型设计（关注高效架构和模型压缩）、高效训练（减少模型学习期间的计算负担）和高效数据收集（解决机器人数据获取和利用的瓶颈）。

Conclusion: 该调查为高效视觉-语言-动作模型领域提供了系统性综述，建立了持续更新的项目页面以跟踪最新发展，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) represent a significant frontier in
embodied intelligence, aiming to bridge digital knowledge with physical-world
interaction. While these models have demonstrated remarkable generalist
capabilities, their deployment is severely hampered by the substantial
computational and data requirements inherent to their underlying large-scale
foundation models. Motivated by the urgent need to address these challenges,
this survey presents the first comprehensive review of Efficient
Vision-Language-Action models (Efficient VLAs) across the entire
data-model-training process. Specifically, we introduce a unified taxonomy to
systematically organize the disparate efforts in this domain, categorizing
current techniques into three core pillars: (1) Efficient Model Design,
focusing on efficient architectures and model compression; (2) Efficient
Training, which reduces computational burdens during model learning; and (3)
Efficient Data Collection, which addresses the bottlenecks in acquiring and
utilizing robotic data. Through a critical review of state-of-the-art methods
within this framework, this survey not only establishes a foundational
reference for the community but also summarizes representative applications,
delineates key challenges, and charts a roadmap for future research. We
maintain a continuously updated project page to track our latest developments:

### [12] [Conflict Adaptation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24804)
*Xiaoyang Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现12个视觉语言模型在顺序Stroop任务中表现出与人类冲突适应一致的行为，通过稀疏自编码器识别出任务相关超节点，并发现与人类阅读和颜色命名自动性不对称相似的神经表征模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人类认知控制中的冲突适应现象是否在人工智能模型中存在，理解视觉语言模型中认知控制行为的表征基础。

Method: 使用顺序Stroop任务测试13个视觉语言模型，采用稀疏自编码器分析InternVL 3.5 4B模型中的任务相关超节点。

Result: 12个模型表现出冲突适应行为，发现文本和颜色在早期和晚期层都有部分重叠的超节点，其相对大小反映了人类阅读和颜色命名的自动性不对称，并在24-25层识别出冲突调节超节点。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型表现出与人类相似的认知控制行为，其内部表征结构反映了人类认知处理的不对称性，为理解AI模型中的认知机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: A signature of human cognitive control is conflict adaptation: improved
performance on a high-conflict trial following another high-conflict trial.
This phenomenon offers an account for how cognitive control, a scarce resource,
is recruited. Using a sequential Stroop task, we find that 12 of 13
vision-language models (VLMs) tested exhibit behavior consistent with conflict
adaptation, with the lone exception likely reflecting a ceiling effect. To
understand the representational basis of this behavior, we use sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant supernodes in InternVL 3.5 4B.
Partially overlapping supernodes emerge for text and color in both early and
late layers, and their relative sizes mirror the automaticity asymmetry between
reading and color naming in humans. We further isolate a conflict-modulated
supernode in layers 24-25 whose ablation significantly increases Stroop errors
while minimally affecting congruent trials.

### [13] [DualCap: Enhancing Lightweight Image Captioning via Dual Retrieval with Similar Scenes Visual Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24813)
*Binbin Li,Guimiao Yang,Zisen Qi,Haiping Wang,Yu Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualCap提出了一种双检索机制，通过图像到图像检索生成视觉提示来增强图像特征，解决现有方法仅使用文本提示造成的语义差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轻量级检索增强图像描述模型仅将检索数据用作文本提示，导致原始视觉特征未得到增强，特别是在对象细节和复杂场景方面存在语义差距。

Method: 采用双检索机制：标准图像到文本检索生成文本提示，新颖的图像到图像检索获取视觉相似场景。从视觉相似场景的标题中提取关键词和短语，通过轻量级可训练特征融合网络将文本特征与原始图像特征集成。

Result: 实验表明该方法在保持竞争力的性能的同时，相比之前的视觉提示描述方法需要更少的可训练参数。

Conclusion: DualCap通过视觉提示增强视觉表示，有效解决了语义差距问题，在性能和参数效率方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Recent lightweight retrieval-augmented image caption models often utilize
retrieved data solely as text prompts, thereby creating a semantic gap by
leaving the original visual features unenhanced, particularly for object
details or complex scenes. To address this limitation, we propose $DualCap$, a
novel approach that enriches the visual representation by generating a visual
prompt from retrieved similar images. Our model employs a dual retrieval
mechanism, using standard image-to-text retrieval for text prompts and a novel
image-to-image retrieval to source visually analogous scenes. Specifically,
salient keywords and phrases are derived from the captions of visually similar
scenes to capture key objects and similar details. These textual features are
then encoded and integrated with the original image features through a
lightweight, trainable feature fusion network. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while requiring
fewer trainable parameters compared to previous visual-prompting captioning
approaches.

TL;DR: 提出一个三阶段框架，结合深度视觉表示和传统机器学习，用于鱼类新鲜度评估，在FFE数据集上达到85.99%准确率，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统感官评估鱼类新鲜度存在主观性、耗时和不一致的问题，现有深度学习方法在准确性和特征透明度方面仍有挑战。

Method: 三阶段框架：1) 微调五种先进视觉架构；2) 提取多级深度特征训练七种传统分类器；3) 使用LGBM、随机森林和Lasso进行特征选择。

Result: 最佳配置（Swin-Tiny特征+Extra Trees分类器+LGBM特征选择）在FFE数据集上达到85.99%准确率，比现有方法提升8.69-22.78%。

Conclusion: 该框架在视觉质量评估任务中具有有效性和泛化能力，为鱼类新鲜度评估提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Assessing fish freshness is vital for ensuring food safety and minimizing
economic losses in the seafood industry. However, traditional sensory
evaluation remains subjective, time-consuming, and inconsistent. Although
recent advances in deep learning have automated visual freshness prediction,
challenges related to accuracy and feature transparency persist. This study
introduces a unified three-stage framework that refines and leverages deep
visual representations for reliable fish freshness assessment. First, five
state-of-the-art vision architectures - ResNet-50, DenseNet-121,
EfficientNet-B0, ConvNeXt-Base, and Swin-Tiny - are fine-tuned to establish a
strong baseline. Next, multi-level deep features extracted from these backbones
are used to train seven classical machine learning classifiers, integrating
deep and traditional decision mechanisms. Finally, feature selection methods
based on Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Random Forest, and Lasso
identify a compact and informative subset of features. Experiments on the
Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate that the best
configuration combining Swin-Tiny features, an Extra Trees classifier, and
LGBM-based feature selection achieves an accuracy of 85.99%, outperforming
recent studies on the same dataset by 8.69-22.78%. These findings confirm the
effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed framework for visual quality
evaluation tasks.

Conclusion: 该基准测试为未来多模态大语言模型在视频假新闻检测领域的评估和发展奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: The advent of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has greatly advanced
research into applications for Video fake news detection (VFND) tasks.
Traditional video-based FND benchmarks typically focus on the accuracy of the
final decision, often failing to provide fine-grained assessments for the
entire detection process, making the detection process a black box. Therefore,
we introduce the MVFNDB (Multi-modal Video Fake News Detection Benchmark) based
on the empirical analysis, which provides foundation for tasks definition. The
benchmark comprises 10 tasks and is meticulously crafted to probe MLLMs'
perception, understanding, and reasoning capacities during detection, featuring
9730 human-annotated video-related questions based on a carefully constructed
taxonomy ability of VFND. To validate the impact of combining multiple features
on the final results, we design a novel framework named MVFND-CoT, which
incorporates both creator-added content and original shooting footage
reasoning. Building upon the benchmark, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the
deeper factors influencing accuracy, including video processing strategies and
the alignment between video features and model capabilities. We believe this
benchmark will lay a solid foundation for future evaluations and advancements
of MLLMs in the domain of video fake news detection.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型的安全方法存在过度拒绝和安全-效用不平衡的问题，需要开发更有效的安全对齐方案。

Method: 提出多轮安全编辑框架，构建MR-SafeEdit数据集，开发SafeEditor统一MLLM模型，采用后处理安全编辑范式模拟人类认知过程。

Result: 实验结果显示SafeEditor超越现有安全方法，在减少过度拒绝的同时实现了更好的安全-效用平衡。

Conclusion: 该框架为文本到图像模型提供了一种模型无关、即插即用的安全编辑解决方案，有效解决了现有安全方法的局限性。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, ensuring their
safety has become increasingly critical. Existing safety approaches can be
categorized into training-time and inference-time methods. While inference-time
methods are widely adopted due to their cost-effectiveness, they often suffer
from limitations such as over-refusal and imbalance between safety and utility.
To address these challenges, we propose a multi-round safety editing framework
that functions as a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module, enabling efficient
safety alignment for any text-to-image model. Central to this framework is
MR-SafeEdit, a multi-round image-text interleaved dataset specifically
constructed for safety editing in text-to-image generation. We introduce a
post-hoc safety editing paradigm that mirrors the human cognitive process of
identifying and refining unsafe content. To instantiate this paradigm, we
develop SafeEditor, a unified MLLM capable of multi-round safety editing on
generated images. Experimental results show that SafeEditor surpasses prior
safety approaches by reducing over-refusal while achieving a more favorable
safety-utility balance.

Motivation: 多模态情感识别在人机交互中至关重要，但面临不同模态间差异大、单模态情感信息表征困难等挑战。

Method: 为每个模态构建对抗自编码器(AAE)学习判别性情感特征，通过跨模态门控机制(CGMM)减少模态差异并建立情感关系，最后使用特征融合模块(FFM)进行多模态融合。

Result: 在公开数据集SIMS和MOSI上的实验表明，MCIHN模型取得了优越的性能。

Conclusion: MCIHN模型通过多路径跨模态交互有效解决了多模态情感识别中的关键挑战，提升了识别准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition is crucial for future human-computer
interaction. However, accurate emotion recognition still faces significant
challenges due to differences between different modalities and the difficulty
of characterizing unimodal emotional information. To solve these problems, a
hybrid network model based on multipath cross-modal interaction (MCIHN) is
proposed. First, adversarial autoencoders (AAE) are constructed separately for
each modality. The AAE learns discriminative emotion features and reconstructs
the features through a decoder to obtain more discriminative information about
the emotion classes. Then, the latent codes from the AAE of different
modalities are fed into a predefined Cross-modal Gate Mechanism model (CGMM) to
reduce the discrepancy between modalities, establish the emotional relationship
between interacting modalities, and generate the interaction features between
different modalities. Multimodal fusion using the Feature Fusion module (FFM)
for better emotion recognition. Experiments were conducted on publicly
available SIMS and MOSI datasets, demonstrating that MCIHN achieves superior
performance.

Conclusion: 通过去噪视角的系统分析，为理解流匹配模型的生成过程提供了新的洞见，有助于改进生成质量。

Abstract: Flow matching has achieved remarkable success, yet the factors influencing
the quality of its generation process remain poorly understood. In this work,
we adopt a denoising perspective and design a framework to empirically probe
the generation process. Laying down the formal connections between flow
matching models and denoisers, we provide a common ground to compare their
performances on generation and denoising. This enables the design of principled
and controlled perturbations to influence sample generation: noise and drift.
This leads to new insights on the distinct dynamical phases of the generative
process, enabling us to precisely characterize at which stage of the generative
process denoisers succeed or fail and why this matters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习方法将成熟度视为离散分类问题，这与生物成熟过程的连续性本质相冲突，导致信息丢失和类别边界模糊。

Method: 对最先进的实时目标检测器RT-DETRv2进行架构修改，引入专用的概率头部，使模型能够为每个检测对象预测成熟度谱上的连续分布。

Result: 在具有挑战性的大规模水果数据集上达到85.6%的平均精度(mAP)，同时提供更细粒度和准确的成熟度评估。

Conclusion: 概率方法为现代农业提供了更智能、不确定性感知的自动化系统，比基于分类的方法提供更丰富和生物学合理的植物成熟度表示。

Abstract: Maturity estimation of fruits and vegetables is a critical task for
agricultural automation, directly impacting yield prediction and robotic
harvesting. Current deep learning approaches predominantly treat maturity as a
discrete classification problem (e.g., unripe, ripe, overripe). This rigid
formulation, however, fundamentally conflicts with the continuous nature of the
biological ripening process, leading to information loss and ambiguous class
boundaries. In this paper, we challenge this paradigm by reframing maturity
estimation as a continuous, probabilistic learning task. We propose a novel
architectural modification to the state-of-the-art, real-time object detector,
RT-DETRv2, by introducing a dedicated probabilistic head. This head enables the
model to predict a continuous distribution over the maturity spectrum for each
detected object, simultaneously learning the mean maturity state and its
associated uncertainty. This uncertainty measure is crucial for downstream
decision-making in robotics, providing a confidence score for tasks like
selective harvesting. Our model not only provides a far richer and more
biologically plausible representation of plant maturity but also maintains
exceptional detection performance, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of
85.6\% on a challenging, large-scale fruit dataset. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments that our probabilistic approach offers more granular and
accurate maturity assessments than its classification-based counterparts,
paving the way for more intelligent, uncertainty-aware automated systems in
modern agriculture

Motivation: Alves等人(2024)的骨架方法虽然提升了识别性能，但使用OpenPose提取关键点影响了时间性能。简单替换为轻量级MediaPipe虽提高速度但显著降低准确性，需要找到平衡性能与效率的解决方案。

Method: 探索关键点子集选择策略优化识别性能，使用样条插补技术有效缓解关键点缺失问题。

Result: 适当的关键点子集实现了与最先进方法相当或更优的性能，同时处理时间比Alves等人(2024)减少5倍以上。样条插补显著提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 仔细的关键点选择结合简单插补技术能够实现高效准确的手势识别，为可扩展的手语识别系统铺平道路。

Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of using lightweight body landmark
detection for the recognition of isolated signs in Brazilian Sign Language
(LIBRAS). Although the skeleton-based approach by Alves et al. (2024) enabled
substantial improvements in recognition performance, the use of OpenPose for
landmark extraction hindered time performance. In a preliminary investigation,
we observed that simply replacing OpenPose with the lightweight MediaPipe,
while improving processing speed, significantly reduced accuracy. To overcome
this limitation, we explored landmark subset selection strategies aimed at
optimizing recognition performance. Experimental results showed that a proper
landmark subset achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art
methods while reducing processing time by more than 5X compared to Alves et al.
(2024). As an additional contribution, we demonstrated that spline-based
imputation effectively mitigates missing landmark issues, leading to
substantial accuracy gains. These findings highlight that careful landmark
selection, combined with simple imputation techniques, enables efficient and
accurate isolated sign recognition, paving the way for scalable Sign Language
Recognition systems.

Abstract: Traffic congestion is becoming a challenge in the rapidly growing urban
cities, resulting in increasing delays and inefficiencies within urban
transportation systems. To address this issue a comprehensive methodology is
designed to optimize traffic flow and minimize delays. The framework is
structured with three primary components: (a) vehicle detection, (b) traffic
prediction, and (c) traffic signal optimization. This paper presents the first
component, vehicle detection. The methodology involves analyzing multiple
sequential frames from a camera feed to compute the background, i.e. the
underlying roadway, by averaging pixel values over time. The computed
background is then utilized to extract the foreground, where the Density-Based
Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is applied to
detect vehicles. With its computational efficiency and minimal infrastructure
modification requirements, the proposed methodology offers a practical and
scalable solution for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成模型难以处理非常规相机运动，因为缺乏包含这些运动的训练视频，限制了艺术创作的可能性。

Method: 提出VividCam训练范式，从合成视频中学习相机运动，采用多种解耦策略隔离相机运动学习和合成外观伪影，使用Unity等引擎渲染低多边形3D场景中的基本几何体作为训练数据。

Result: 能够合成广泛且精确控制的复杂相机运动，仅使用简单的合成数据就能实现，展示了强大的运动表示能力。

Conclusion: VividCam通过合成数据有效解决了复杂相机运动学习的问题，为艺术视频创作提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Although recent text-to-video generative models are getting more capable of
following external camera controls, imposed by either text descriptions or
camera trajectories, they still struggle to generalize to unconventional camera
motions, which is crucial in creating truly original and artistic videos. The
challenge lies in the difficulty of finding sufficient training videos with the
intended uncommon camera motions. To address this challenge, we propose
VividCam, a training paradigm that enables diffusion models to learn complex
camera motions from synthetic videos, releasing the reliance on collecting
realistic training videos. VividCam incorporates multiple disentanglement
strategies that isolates camera motion learning from synthetic appearance
artifacts, ensuring more robust motion representation and mitigating domain
shift. We demonstrate that our design synthesizes a wide range of precisely
controlled and complex camera motions using surprisingly simple synthetic data.
Notably, this synthetic data often consists of basic geometries within a
low-poly 3D scene and can be efficiently rendered by engines like Unity. Our
video results can be found in https://wuqiuche.github.io/VividCamDemoPage/ .

Abstract: Multi-view transformers such as DUSt3R are revolutionizing 3D vision by
solving 3D tasks in a feed-forward manner. However, contrary to previous
optimization-based pipelines, the inner mechanisms of multi-view transformers
are unclear. Their black-box nature makes further improvements beyond data
scaling challenging and complicates usage in safety- and reliability-critical
applications. Here, we present an approach for probing and visualizing 3D
representations from the residual connections of the multi-view transformers'
layers. In this manner, we investigate a variant of the DUSt3R model, shedding
light on the development of its latent state across blocks, the role of the
individual layers, and suggest how it differs from methods with stronger
inductive biases of explicit global pose. Finally, we show that the
investigated variant of DUSt3R estimates correspondences that are refined with
reconstructed geometry. The code used for the analysis is available at

Motivation: 多模态学习中主导模态往往会压制其他模态，限制了模型的泛化能力，需要一种方法来平衡各模态的贡献。

Method: M-SAM框架包含三个步骤：1) 使用Shapley值识别主导模态；2) 调制损失函数以增强主导模态的鲁棒性；3) 通过调制后的梯度进行权重更新。

Result: 在四个不同数据集上的实验表明，M-SAM优于最新的优化和梯度操作方法，显著平衡和改进了多模态学习性能。

Conclusion: M-SAM是一个模型无关的框架，能够有效解决多模态学习中的主导模态问题，提升整体性能。

Abstract: In multimodal learning, dominant modalities often overshadow others, limiting
generalization. We propose Modality-Aware Sharpness-Aware Minimization (M-SAM),
a model-agnostic framework that applies to many modalities and supports early
and late fusion scenarios. In every iteration, M-SAM in three steps optimizes
learning. \textbf{First, it identifies the dominant modality} based on
modalities' contribution in the accuracy using Shapley. \textbf{Second, it
decomposes the loss landscape}, or in another language, it modulates the loss
to prioritize the robustness of the model in favor of the dominant modality,
and \textbf{third, M-SAM updates the weights} by backpropagation of modulated
gradients. This ensures robust learning for the dominant modality while
enhancing contributions from others, allowing the model to explore and exploit
complementary features that strengthen overall performance. Extensive
experiments on four diverse datasets show that M-SAM outperforms the latest
state-of-the-art optimization and gradient manipulation methods and
significantly balances and improves multimodal learning.

Conclusion: IBIS混合架构成功解决了Wi-Fi感知中的过拟合问题，实现了优异的运动识别性能，为相关应用提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing interest in Wi-Fi sensing stems from its potential to capture
environmental data in a low-cost, non-intrusive way, making it ideal for
applications like healthcare, space occupancy analysis, and gesture-based IoT
control. However, a major limitation in this field is the common problem of
overfitting, where models perform well on training data but fail to generalize
to new data. To overcome this, we introduce a novel hybrid architecture that
integrates Inception-BiLSTM with a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which we refer
to as IBIS. Our IBIS approach is uniquely engineered to improve model
generalization and create more robust classification boundaries. By applying
this method to Doppler-derived data, we achieve a movement recognition accuracy
of nearly 99%. Comprehensive performance metrics and confusion matrices confirm
the significant effectiveness of our proposed solution.

Abstract: Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a serious and prevalent healthcare concern.
Accurate classification of PU severity (Stages I-IV) is essential for proper
treatment but remains challenging due to subtle visual distinctions and
subjective interpretation, leading to variability among clinicians. Prior
AI-based approaches using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision
Transformers (ViTs) achieved promising accuracy but offered limited
interpretability. We present FT-ARM (Fine-Tuned Agentic Reflection Multimodal
model), a fine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM) with an agentic
self-reflection mechanism for pressure ulcer severity classification. Inspired
by clinician-style diagnostic reassessment, FT-ARM iteratively refines its
predictions by reasoning over visual features and encoded clinical knowledge
from text, enhancing both accuracy and consistency. On the publicly available
Pressure Injury Image Dataset (PIID), FT-ARM, fine-tuned from LLaMA 3.2 90B,
achieved 85% accuracy in classifying PU stages I-IV, surpassing prior CNN-based
models by +4%. Unlike earlier CNN/ViT studies that relied solely on offline
evaluations, FT-ARM is designed and tested for live inference, reflecting
real-time deployment conditions. Furthermore, it produces clinically grounded
natural-language explanations, improving interpretability and trust. By
integrating fine-tuning and reflective reasoning across multimodal inputs,
FT-ARM advances the reliability, transparency, and clinical applicability of
automated wound assessment systems, addressing the critical need for consistent
and explainable PU staging to support improved patient care.

Abstract: Developing a highly accurate automatic license plate recognition system
(ALPR) is challenging due to environmental factors such as lighting, rain, and
dust. Additional difficulties include high vehicle speeds, varying camera
angles, and low-quality or low-resolution images. ALPR is vital in traffic
control, parking, vehicle tracking, toll collection, and law enforcement
applications. This paper proposes a deep learning strategy using YOLOv8 for
license plate detection and recognition tasks. This method seeks to enhance the
performance of the model using datasets from Ontario, Quebec, California, and
New York State. It achieved an impressive recall rate of 94% on the dataset
from the Center for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (CENPARMI) and
91% on the UFPR-ALPR dataset. In addition, our method follows a semi-supervised
learning framework, combining a small set of manually labeled data with
pseudo-labels generated by Grounding DINO to train our detection model.
Grounding DINO, a powerful vision-language model, automatically annotates many
images with bounding boxes for license plates, thereby minimizing the reliance
on labor-intensive manual labeling. By integrating human-verified and
model-generated annotations, we can scale our dataset efficiently while
maintaining label quality, which significantly enhances the training process
and overall model performance. Furthermore, it reports character error rates
for both datasets, providing additional insight into system performance.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among women in
the developed world. Early detection through mammography screening plays a
pivotal role in reducing mortality rates. While computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
systems have shown promise in assisting radiologists, existing approaches face
critical limitations in clinical deployment - particularly in handling the
nuanced interpretation of multi-modal data and feasibility due to the
requirement of prior clinical history. This study introduces a novel framework
that synergistically combines visual features from 2D mammograms with
structured textual descriptors derived from easily accessible clinical metadata
and synthesized radiological reports through innovative tokenization modules.
Our proposed methods in this study demonstrate that strategic integration of
convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with language representations achieves
superior performance to vision transformer-based models while handling
high-resolution images and enabling practical deployment across diverse
populations. By evaluating it on multi-national cohort screening mammograms,
our multi-modal approach achieves superior performance in cancer detection and
calcification identification compared to unimodal baselines, with particular
improvements. The proposed method establishes a new paradigm for developing
clinically viable VLM-based CAD systems that effectively leverage imaging data
and contextual patient information through effective fusion mechanisms.

Conclusion: DRIP方法有效提升视觉语言模型训练效率，并在科学领域验证了其应用价值

Abstract: Recently, the advances in vision-language models, including contrastive
pretraining and instruction tuning, have greatly pushed the frontier of
multimodal AI. However, owing to the large-scale and hence expensive
pretraining, the efficiency concern has discouraged researchers from attempting
to pretrain a vision language model from scratch. In this work, we propose
Dynamic patch Reduction via Interpretable Pooling (DRIP), which adapts to the
input images and dynamically merges tokens in the deeper layers of a visual
encoder. Our results on both ImageNet training from scratch and CLIP
contrastive pretraining demonstrate a significant GFLOP reduction while
maintaining comparable classification/zero-shot performance. To further
validate our proposed method, we conduct continual pretraining on a large
biology dataset, extending its impact into scientific domains.

Abstract: Zero-shot scene understanding in real-world settings presents major
challenges due to the complexity and variability of natural scenes, where
models must recognize new objects, actions, and contexts without prior labeled
examples. This work proposes a vision-language integration framework that
unifies pre-trained visual encoders (e.g., CLIP, ViT) and large language models
(e.g., GPT-based architectures) to achieve semantic alignment between visual
and textual modalities. The goal is to enable robust zero-shot comprehension of
scenes by leveraging natural language as a bridge to generalize over unseen
categories and contexts. Our approach develops a unified model that embeds
visual inputs and textual prompts into a shared space, followed by multimodal
fusion and reasoning layers for contextual interpretation. Experiments on
Visual Genome, COCO, ADE20K, and custom real-world datasets demonstrate
significant gains over state-of-the-art zero-shot models in object recognition,
activity detection, and scene captioning. The proposed system achieves up to
18% improvement in top-1 accuracy and notable gains in semantic coherence
metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of cross-modal alignment and language
grounding in enhancing generalization for real-world scene understanding.

Abstract: Recent advancements in personalized image generation have significantly
improved facial identity preservation, particularly in fields such as
entertainment and social media. However, existing methods still struggle to
achieve precise control over facial attributes in a per-subject-tuning-free
(PSTF) way. Tuning-based techniques like PreciseControl have shown promise by
providing fine-grained control over facial features, but they often require
extensive technical expertise and additional training data, limiting their
accessibility. In contrast, PSTF approaches simplify the process by enabling
image generation from a single facial input, but they lack precise control over
facial attributes. In this paper, we introduce a novel, PSTF method that
enables both precise control over facial attributes and high-fidelity
preservation of facial identity. Our approach utilizes a face recognition model
to extract facial identity features, which are then mapped into the $W^+$
latent space of StyleGAN2 using the e4e encoder. We further enhance the model
with a Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module, which integrates facial
identity, attribute features, and text embeddings into the UNet architecture,
ensuring clean separation of identity and attribute information. Trained on the
FFHQ dataset, our method allows for the generation of personalized images with
fine-grained control over facial attributes, while without requiring additional
fine-tuning or training data for individual identities. We demonstrate that our
approach successfully balances personalization with precise facial attribute
control, offering a more efficient and user-friendly solution for high-quality,
adaptable facial image synthesis. The code is publicly available at

Method: VDRP框架包含两个核心组件：1）视觉多样性感知提示学习，通过注入组间视觉方差和高斯扰动来捕捉动词的多样化视觉变化；2）区域感知提示，从人、物和联合区域检索特定概念来增强动词级区分能力。

Abstract: Zero-shot Human-Object Interaction detection aims to localize humans and
objects in an image and recognize their interaction, even when specific
verb-object pairs are unseen during training. Recent works have shown promising
results using prompt learning with pretrained vision-language models such as
CLIP, which align natural language prompts with visual features in a shared
embedding space. However, existing approaches still fail to handle the visual
complexity of interaction, including (1) intra-class visual diversity, where
instances of the same verb appear in diverse poses and contexts, and (2)
inter-class visual entanglement, where distinct verbs yield visually similar
patterns. To address these challenges, we propose VDRP, a framework for Visual
Diversity and Region-aware Prompt learning. First, we introduce a visual
diversity-aware prompt learning strategy that injects group-wise visual
variance into the context embedding. We further apply Gaussian perturbation to
encourage the prompts to capture diverse visual variations of a verb. Second,
we retrieve region-specific concepts from the human, object, and union regions.
These are used to augment the diversity-aware prompt embeddings, yielding
region-aware prompts that enhance verb-level discrimination. Experiments on the
HICO-DET benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance under four zero-shot evaluation settings, effectively addressing
both intra-class diversity and inter-class visual entanglement. Code is

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of indoor and urban environments is a prominent research
topic with various downstream applications. However, existing geometric priors
for addressing low-texture regions in indoor and urban settings often lack
global consistency. Moreover, Gaussian Splatting and implicit SDF fields often
suffer from discontinuities or exhibit computational inefficiencies, resulting
in a loss of detail. To address these issues, we propose an Atlanta-world
guided implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting that achieves smooth indoor and
urban scene reconstruction while preserving high-frequency details and
rendering efficiency. By leveraging the Atlanta-world model, we ensure the
accurate surface reconstruction for low-texture regions, while the proposed
novel implicit-structured GS representations provide smoothness without
sacrificing efficiency and high-frequency details. Specifically, we propose a
semantic GS representation to predict the probability of all semantic regions
and deploy a structure plane regularization with learnable plane indicators for
global accurate surface reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both indoor and urban
scenes, delivering superior surface reconstruction quality.

TL;DR: Region-CAM是一种新的类激活映射方法，通过提取语义信息图和语义信息传播，解决了传统CAM方法只能突出最具判别性区域的问题，显著提升了弱监督语义分割和目标定位的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CAM方法只能突出目标的最具判别性区域，无法覆盖整个对象且边界对齐不准确，限制了弱监督学习任务的性能，特别是需要像素级准确激活图的弱监督语义分割任务。

Method: 提出Region-CAM方法，通过提取语义信息图(SIMs)和进行语义信息传播(SIP)，同时考虑基线分类模型各阶段的梯度和特征，生成更完整的对象区域激活图。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC数据集上，Region-CAM达到60.12%和58.43%的mIoU，相比原始CAM提升13.61%和13.13%；在MS COCO数据集上达到36.38% mIoU，提升16.23%；在ILSVRC2012数据集上达到51.7%的Top-1定位精度，优于LayerCAM 4.5%。

Conclusion: Region-CAM能够生成覆盖更完整对象区域且边界更精确的激活图，显著提升了弱监督语义分割和目标定位任务的性能。

Abstract: Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods are widely applied in weakly
supervised learning tasks due to their ability to highlight object regions.
However, conventional CAM methods highlight only the most discriminative
regions of the target. These highlighted regions often fail to cover the entire
object and are frequently misaligned with object boundaries, thereby limiting
the performance of downstream weakly supervised learning tasks, particularly
Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which demands pixel-wise
accurate activation maps to get the best results. To alleviate the above
problems, we propose a novel activation method, Region-CAM. Distinct from
network feature weighting approaches, Region-CAM generates activation maps by
extracting semantic information maps (SIMs) and performing semantic information
propagation (SIP) by considering both gradients and features in each of the
stages of the baseline classification model. Our approach highlights a greater
proportion of object regions while ensuring activation maps to have precise
boundaries that align closely with object edges. Region-CAM achieves 60.12% and
58.43% mean intersection over union (mIoU) using the baseline model on the
PASCAL VOC training and validation datasets, respectively, which are
improvements of 13.61% and 13.13% over the original CAM (46.51% and 45.30%). On
the MS COCO validation set, Region-CAM achieves 36.38%, a 16.23% improvement
over the original CAM (20.15%). We also demonstrate the superiority of
Region-CAM in object localization tasks, using the ILSVRC2012 validation set.
Region-CAM achieves 51.7% in Top-1 Localization accuracy Loc1. Compared with
LayerCAM, an activation method designed for weakly supervised object
localization, Region-CAM achieves 4.5% better performance in Loc1.

Experimental validation demonstrates substantial improvements: Tunnel Segment
Crack detection (648 images) achieves 12.4% improvement, Construction PPE (1K
images) gains 13.7%, and KITTI (7K images) shows 88.6% improvement, while
maintaining real-time inference (30-47 FPS). Systematic ablation across five
YOLO scales and nine DINOv3 variants reveals that Medium-scale architectures
achieve optimal performance with DualP0P3 integration (55.77% mAP@0.5), while

Abstract: The rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made detecting
AI-generated images a critical challenge for ensuring authenticity. Existing
reconstruction-based methods lack theoretical foundations and on empirical
heuristics, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this paper, we
introduce the Jacobian-Spectral Lower Bound for reconstruction error from a
geometric perspective, showing that real images off the reconstruction manifold
exhibit a non-trivial error lower bound, while generated images on the manifold
have near-zero error. Furthermore, we reveal the limitations of existing
methods that rely on static reconstruction error from a single pass. These
methods often fail when some real images exhibit lower error than generated
ones. This counterintuitive behavior reduces detection accuracy and requires
data-specific threshold tuning, limiting their applicability in real-world
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReGap, a training-free
method that computes dynamic reconstruction error by leveraging structured
editing operations to introduce controlled perturbations. This enables
measuring error changes before and after editing, improving detection accuracy
by enhancing error separation. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms existing baselines, exhibits robustness to common post-processing
operations and generalizes effectively across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Current 3D scene understanding methods are limited by offline-collected
multi-view data or pre-constructed 3D geometry. In this paper, we present
ExtractAnything3D (EA3D), a unified online framework for open-world 3D object
extraction that enables simultaneous geometric reconstruction and holistic
scene understanding. Given a streaming video, EA3D dynamically interprets each
frame using vision-language and 2D vision foundation encoders to extract
object-level knowledge. This knowledge is integrated and embedded into a
Gaussian feature map via a feed-forward online update strategy. We then
iteratively estimate visual odometry from historical frames and incrementally
update online Gaussian features with new observations. A recurrent joint
optimization module directs the model's attention to regions of interest,
simultaneously enhancing both geometric reconstruction and semantic
understanding. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and tasks,
including photo-realistic rendering, semantic and instance segmentation, 3D
bounding box and semantic occupancy estimation, and 3D mesh generation,
demonstrate the effectiveness of EA3D. Our method establishes a unified and
efficient framework for joint online 3D reconstruction and holistic scene
understanding, enabling a broad range of downstream tasks.

Abstract: Thin film interferometry is a powerful technique for non-invasively measuring
liquid film thickness with applications in ophthalmology, but its clinical
translation is hindered by the challenges in reconstructing thickness profiles
from interference patterns - an ill-posed inverse problem complicated by phase
periodicity, imaging noise and ambient artifacts. Traditional reconstruction
methods are either computationally intensive, sensitive to noise, or require
manual expert analysis, which is impractical for real-time diagnostics. To
address this challenge, here we present a vision transformer-based approach for
real-time inference of thin liquid film thickness profiles directly from
isolated interferograms. Trained on a hybrid dataset combining
physiologically-relevant synthetic and experimental tear film data, our model
leverages long-range spatial correlations to resolve phase ambiguities and
reconstruct temporally coherent thickness profiles in a single forward pass
from dynamic interferograms acquired in vivo and ex vivo. The network
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on noisy, rapidly-evolving films with
motion artifacts, overcoming limitations of conventional phase-unwrapping and
iterative fitting methods. Our data-driven approach enables automated,
consistent thickness reconstruction at real-time speeds on consumer hardware,
opening new possibilities for continuous monitoring of pre-lens ocular tear
films and non-invasive diagnosis of conditions such as the dry eye disease.

Abstract: Deep generative models, such as diffusion models, have shown promising
progress in image generation and audio generation via simplified continuity
assumptions. However, the development of generative modeling techniques for
generating multi-modal data, such as parametric CAD sequences, still lags
behind due to the challenges in addressing long-range constraints and parameter
sensitivity. In this work, we propose a novel framework for quantitatively
constrained CAD generation, termed Target-Guided Bayesian Flow Network (TGBFN).
For the first time, TGBFN handles the multi-modality of CAD sequences (i.e.,
discrete commands and continuous parameters) in a unified continuous and
differentiable parameter space rather than in the discrete data space. In
addition, TGBFN penetrates the parameter update kernel and introduces a guided
Bayesian flow to control the CAD properties. To evaluate TGBFN, we construct a
new dataset for quantitatively constrained CAD generation. Extensive
comparisons across single-condition and multi-condition constrained generation
tasks demonstrate that TGBFN achieves state-of-the-art performance in
generating high-fidelity, condition-aware CAD sequences. The code is available

Abstract: Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown great potential for urban scene
reconstruction in the field of autonomous driving. However, current urban scene
reconstruction methods often depend on multimodal sensors as inputs,
\textit{i.e.} LiDAR and images. Though the geometry prior provided by LiDAR
point clouds can largely mitigate ill-posedness in reconstruction, acquiring
such accurate LiDAR data is still challenging in practice: i) precise
spatiotemporal calibration between LiDAR and other sensors is required, as they
may not capture data simultaneously; ii) reprojection errors arise from spatial
misalignment when LiDAR and cameras are mounted at different locations. To
avoid the difficulty of acquiring accurate LiDAR depth, we propose $D^2GS$, a
LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework. In this work, we obtain
geometry priors that are as effective as LiDAR while being denser and more
accurate. $\textbf{First}$, we initialize a dense point cloud by
back-projecting multi-view metric depth predictions. This point cloud is then
optimized by a Progressive Pruning strategy to improve the global consistency.
$\textbf{Second}$, we jointly refine Gaussian geometry and predicted dense
metric depth via a Depth Enhancer. Specifically, we leverage diffusion priors
from a depth foundation model to enhance the depth maps rendered by Gaussians.
In turn, the enhanced depths provide stronger geometric constraints during
Gaussian training. $\textbf{Finally}$, we improve the accuracy of ground
geometry by constraining the shape and normal attributes of Gaussians within
road regions. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing more
accurate geometry even when compared with those using ground-truth LiDAR data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出扩展上下文感知分类器(ECAC)，通过动态调整分类器来解决语义分割中固定参数分类器无法适应不同图像独特特征的问题，在多个数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语义分割方法使用固定参数分类器，无法适应不同图像的独特类别分布特征，且数据集级别的类别不平衡导致模型偏向多数类，限制了少数类区域的识别能力。

Method: 提出ECAC分类器，利用内存库学习数据集级别的全局上下文信息，并结合当前图像的局部上下文信息动态调整分类器。采用教师-学生网络范式，教师网络使用真实标签动态调整上下文信息并向学生网络传递知识。

Result: 在ADE20K、COCO-Stuff10K和Pascal-Context等多个数据集上的综合实验表明，ECAC能够达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ECAC通过动态结合全局和局部上下文信息有效解决了语义分割中的类别不平衡问题，提升了模型对不同图像特征的适应能力。

Abstract: Prevalent semantic segmentation methods generally adopt a vanilla classifier
to categorize each pixel into specific classes.
  Although such a classifier learns global information from the training data,
this information is represented by a set of fixed parameters (weights and
biases).
  However, each image has a different class distribution, which prevents the
classifier from addressing the unique characteristics of individual images.
  At the dataset level, class imbalance leads to segmentation results being
biased towards majority classes, limiting the model's effectiveness in
identifying and segmenting minority class regions.
  In this paper, we propose an Extended Context-Aware Classifier (ECAC) that
dynamically adjusts the classifier using global (dataset-level) and local
(image-level) contextual information.
  Specifically, we leverage a memory bank to learn dataset-level contextual
information of each class, incorporating the class-specific contextual
information from the current image to improve the classifier for precise pixel
labeling.
  Additionally, a teacher-student network paradigm is adopted, where the domain
expert (teacher network) dynamically adjusts contextual information with ground
truth and transfers knowledge to the student network.
  Comprehensive experiments illustrate that the proposed ECAC can achieve
state-of-the-art performance across several datasets, including ADE20K,
COCO-Stuff10K, and Pascal-Context.

Abstract: In recent years, test-time adaptive object detection has attracted increasing
attention due to its unique advantages in online domain adaptation, which
aligns more closely with real-world application scenarios. However, existing
approaches heavily rely on source-derived statistical characteristics while
making the strong assumption that the source and target domains share an
identical category space. In this paper, we propose the first foundation
model-powered test-time adaptive object detection method that eliminates the
need for source data entirely and overcomes traditional closed-set limitations.
Specifically, we design a Multi-modal Prompt-based Mean-Teacher framework for
vision-language detector-driven test-time adaptation, which incorporates text
and visual prompt tuning to adapt both language and vision representation
spaces on the test data in a parameter-efficient manner. Correspondingly, we
propose a Test-time Warm-start strategy tailored for the visual prompts to
effectively preserve the representation capability of the vision branch.
Furthermore, to guarantee high-quality pseudo-labels in every test batch, we
maintain an Instance Dynamic Memory (IDM) module that stores high-quality
pseudo-labels from previous test samples, and propose two novel
strategies-Memory Enhancement and Memory Hallucination-to leverage IDM's
high-quality instances for enhancing original predictions and hallucinating
images without available pseudo-labels, respectively. Extensive experiments on
cross-corruption and cross-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, and can adapt to
arbitrary cross-domain and cross-category target data. Code is available at

Conclusion: U-CAN提供了一种有效的无监督去噪解决方案，其一致性约束不仅适用于3D领域，也可用于2D图像去噪。

Abstract: Point clouds captured by scanning sensors are often perturbed by noise, which
have a highly negative impact on downstream tasks (e.g. surface reconstruction
and shape understanding). Previous works mostly focus on training neural
networks with noisy-clean point cloud pairs for learning denoising priors,
which requires extensively manual efforts. In this work, we introduce U-CAN, an
Unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising with Consistency-Aware
Noise2Noise matching. Specifically, we leverage a neural network to infer a
multi-step denoising path for each point of a shape or scene with a noise to
noise matching scheme. We achieve this by a novel loss which enables
statistical reasoning on multiple noisy point cloud observations. We further
introduce a novel constraint on the denoised geometry consistency for learning
consistency-aware denoising patterns. We justify that the proposed constraint
is a general term which is not limited to 3D domain and can also contribute to
the area of 2D image denoising. Our evaluations under the widely used
benchmarks in point cloud denoising, upsampling and image denoising show
significant improvement over the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, where
U-CAN also produces comparable results with the supervised methods.

Result: 在DiLiGenT基准测试中，MSF-Net在表面法线估计精度上显著超越了先前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: MSF-Net通过改进多阶段特征提取和特征交互，有效解决了复杂区域的特征冗余问题，提升了光度立体法的性能。

Abstract: Photometric stereo is a technique aimed at determining surface normals
through the utilization of shading cues derived from images taken under
different lighting conditions. However, existing learning-based approaches
often fail to accurately capture features at multiple stages and do not
adequately promote interaction between these features. Consequently, these
models tend to extract redundant features, especially in areas with intricate
details such as wrinkles and edges. To tackle these issues, we propose MSF-Net,
a novel framework for extracting information at multiple stages, paired with
selective update strategy, aiming to extract high-quality feature information,
which is critical for accurate normal construction. Additionally, we have
developed a feature fusion module to improve the interplay among different
features. Experimental results on the DiLiGenT benchmark show that our proposed
MSF-Net significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in the
accuracy of surface normal estimation.

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is emerging as a compelling solution for
medical image segmentation under privacy constraints, yet current approaches
often ignore sample difficulty and struggle with noisy supervision under domain
shift. We present a new SFDA framework that leverages Hard Sample Selection and
Denoised Patch Mixing to progressively align target distributions. First,
unlabeled images are partitioned into reliable and unreliable subsets through
entropy-similarity analysis, allowing adaptation to start from easy samples and
gradually incorporate harder ones. Next, pseudo-labels are refined via Monte
Carlo-based denoising masks, which suppress unreliable pixels and stabilize
training. Finally, intra- and inter-domain objectives mix patches between
subsets, transferring reliable semantics while mitigating noise. Experiments on
benchmark datasets show consistent gains over prior SFDA and UDA methods,
delivering more accurate boundary delineation and achieving state-of-the-art
Dice and ASSD scores. Our study highlights the importance of progressive
adaptation and denoised supervision for robust segmentation under domain shift.

Abstract: Rectified flow is a generative model that learns smooth transport mappings
between two distributions through an ordinary differential equation (ODE).
Unlike diffusion-based generative models, which require costly numerical
integration of a generative ODE to sample images with state-of-the-art quality,
rectified flow uses an iterative process called reflow to learn smooth and
straight ODE paths. This allows for relatively simple and efficient generation
of high-quality images. However, rectified flow still faces several challenges.
1) The reflow process requires a large number of generative pairs to preserve
the target distribution, leading to significant computational costs. 2) Since
the model is typically trained using only generated image pairs, its
performance heavily depends on the 1-rectified flow model, causing it to become
biased towards the generated data.
  In this work, we experimentally expose the limitations of the original
rectified flow and propose a novel approach that incorporates real images into
the training process. By preserving the ODE paths for real images, our method
effectively reduces reliance on large amounts of generated data. Instead, we
demonstrate that the reflow process can be conducted efficiently using a much
smaller set of generated and real images. In CIFAR-10, we achieved
significantly better FID scores, not only in one-step generation but also in
full-step simulations, while using only of the generative pairs compared to the
original method. Furthermore, our approach induces straighter paths and avoids
saturation on generated images during reflow, leading to more robust ODE
learning while preserving the distribution of real images.

Motivation: 随着AIGC的发展，逼真且富有表现力的3D面部动画需求日益增长。然而，由于真实情感3D面部数据集的稀缺，现有方法在生成情感表达性说话面部方面存在局限。

Abstract: Expressions are fundamental to conveying human emotions. With the rapid
advancement of AI-generated content (AIGC), realistic and expressive 3D facial
animation has become increasingly crucial. Despite recent progress in
speech-driven lip-sync for talking-face animation, generating emotionally
expressive talking faces remains underexplored. A major obstacle is the
scarcity of real emotional 3D talking-face datasets due to the high cost of
data capture. To address this, we model facial animation driven by both speech
and emotion as a linear additive problem. Leveraging a 3D talking-face dataset
with neutral expressions (VOCAset) and a dataset of 3D expression sequences
(Florence4D), we jointly learn a set of blendshapes driven by speech and
emotion. We introduce a sparsity constraint loss to encourage disentanglement
between the two types of blendshapes while allowing the model to capture
inherent secondary cross-domain deformations present in the training data. The
learned blendshapes can be further mapped to the expression and jaw pose
parameters of the FLAME model, enabling the animation of 3D Gaussian avatars.
Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method naturally
generates talking faces with specified expressions while maintaining accurate
lip synchronization. Perceptual studies further show that our approach achieves
superior emotional expressivity compared to existing methods, without
compromising lip-sync quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative models have made it easier to manipulate
face videos, raising significant concerns about their potential misuse for
fraud and misinformation. Existing detectors often perform well in in-domain
scenarios but fail to generalize across diverse manipulation techniques due to
their reliance on forgery-specific artifacts. In this work, we introduce
DeepShield, a novel deepfake detection framework that balances local
sensitivity and global generalization to improve robustness across unseen
forgeries. DeepShield enhances the CLIP-ViT encoder through two key components:
Local Patch Guidance (LPG) and Global Forgery Diversification (GFD). LPG
applies spatiotemporal artifact modeling and patch-wise supervision to capture
fine-grained inconsistencies often overlooked by global models. GFD introduces
domain feature augmentation, leveraging domain-bridging and boundary-expanding
feature generation to synthesize diverse forgeries, mitigating overfitting and
enhancing cross-domain adaptability. Through the integration of novel local and
global analysis for deepfake detection, DeepShield outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation evaluations, achieving superior
robustness against unseen deepfake attacks.

Method: 使用德国四个农业景观的高分辨率航空影像和新生成的数据集，比较了卷积神经网络(CNNs)、视觉变换器和混合CNN-变换器模型，包括六种语义分割架构(ABCNet、LSKNet、FT-UNetFormer、DC-Swin、BANet和U-Net)，将木本植被分为森林、斑块、线性和树木四类。

Result: 所有模型在四个景观中都取得了良好的分类精度，FT-UNetFormer表现最佳(平均IoU 0.74；平均F1分数0.84)，森林和线性类别分类效果好，但斑块和树木等边缘密度高的复杂结构分类存在挑战。

Conclusion: 研究强调了空间上下文理解在TOF映射中的重要性，泛化实验表明需要区域多样化的训练数据来确保可靠的大规模映射，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Trees Outside Forests (TOF) play an important role in agricultural landscapes
by supporting biodiversity, sequestering carbon, and regulating microclimates.
Yet, most studies have treated TOF as a single class or relied on rigid
rule-based thresholds, limiting ecological interpretation and adaptability
across regions. To address this, we evaluate deep learning for TOF
classification using a newly generated dataset and high-resolution aerial
imagery from four agricultural landscapes in Germany. Specifically, we compare
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision transformers, and hybrid
CNN-transformer models across six semantic segmentation architectures (ABCNet,
LSKNet, FT-UNetFormer, DC-Swin, BANet, and U-Net) to map four categories of
woody vegetation: Forest, Patch, Linear, and Tree, derived from previous
studies and governmental products. Overall, the models achieved good
classification accuracy across the four landscapes, with the FT-UNetFormer
performing best (mean Intersection-over-Union 0.74; mean F1 score 0.84),
underscoring the importance of spatial context understanding in TOF mapping and
classification. Our results show good results for Forest and Linear class and
reveal challenges particularly in classifying complex structures with high edge
density, notably the Patch and Tree class. Our generalization experiments
highlight the need for regionally diverse training data to ensure reliable
large-scale mapping. The dataset and code are openly available at

Abstract: Real-time object detection has achieved substantial progress through
meticulously designed architectures and optimization strategies. However, the
pursuit of high-speed inference via lightweight network designs often leads to
degraded feature representation, which hinders further performance improvements
and practical on-device deployment. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective
and highly adaptable distillation framework that harnesses the rapidly evolving
capabilities of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to enhance lightweight object
detectors. Given the significant architectural and learning objective
disparities between VFMs and resource-constrained detectors, achieving stable
and task-aligned semantic transfer is challenging. To address this, on one
hand, we introduce a Deep Semantic Injector (DSI) module that facilitates the
integration of high-level representations from VFMs into the deep layers of the
detector. On the other hand, we devise a Gradient-guided Adaptive Modulation
(GAM) strategy, which dynamically adjusts the intensity of semantic transfer
based on gradient norm ratios. Without increasing deployment and inference
overhead, our approach painlessly delivers striking and consistent performance
gains across diverse DETR-based models, underscoring its practical utility for
real-time detection. Our new model family, RT-DETRv4, achieves state-of-the-art
results on COCO, attaining AP scores of 49.7/53.5/55.4/57.0 at corresponding
speeds of 273/169/124/78 FPS.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖启发式或可学习的视觉分组，而LangHOPS旨在通过语言空间中的对象-部件层次结构来改进分割性能。

Method: 将多模态大语言模型集成到对象-部件解析流程中，利用其丰富的知识和推理能力，连接层次结构中的多粒度概念。

Conclusion: 消融研究验证了语言基础层次结构和MLLM驱动的部件查询细化策略的有效性。

Abstract: We propose LangHOPS, the first Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based
framework for open-vocabulary object-part instance segmentation. Given an
image, LangHOPS can jointly detect and segment hierarchical object and part
instances from open-vocabulary candidate categories. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on heuristic or learnable visual grouping, our approach grounds
object-part hierarchies in language space. It integrates the MLLM into the
object-part parsing pipeline to leverage its rich knowledge and reasoning
capabilities, and link multi-granularity concepts within the hierarchies. We
evaluate LangHOPS across multiple challenging scenarios, including in-domain
and cross-dataset object-part instance segmentation, and zero-shot semantic
segmentation. LangHOPS achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing previous
methods by 5.5% Average Precision (AP) (in-domain) and 4.8% (cross-dataset) on
the PartImageNet dataset and by 2.5% mIOU on unseen object parts in ADE20K
(zero-shot). Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the
language-grounded hierarchy and MLLM driven part query refinement strategy. The
code will be released here.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFDA方法受限于源-目标域差异的根本限制：非生成方法在大域差异场景下伪标签不可靠，生成方法在创建伪源数据时域差异扩大导致性能下降。

Method: 将目标样本分为信任集和非信任集，对非信任集样本使用潜在扩散模型进行语义转换并保持目标分布，设计渐进式精炼机制通过迭代减小伪目标域与真实目标域的差异。

Conclusion: DPTM通过扩散驱动的渐进式目标操纵有效解决了SFDA中的域差异问题，实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is a challenging task that tackles
domain shifts using only a pre-trained source model and unlabeled target data.
Existing SFDA methods are restricted by the fundamental limitation of
source-target domain discrepancy. Non-generation SFDA methods suffer from
unreliable pseudo-labels in challenging scenarios with large domain
discrepancies, while generation-based SFDA methods are evidently degraded due
to enlarged domain discrepancies in creating pseudo-source data. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel generation-based framework named
Diffusion-Driven Progressive Target Manipulation (DPTM) that leverages
unlabeled target data as references to reliably generate and progressively
refine a pseudo-target domain for SFDA. Specifically, we divide the target
samples into a trust set and a non-trust set based on the reliability of
pseudo-labels to sufficiently and reliably exploit their information. For
samples from the non-trust set, we develop a manipulation strategy to
semantically transform them into the newly assigned categories, while
simultaneously maintaining them in the target distribution via a latent
diffusion model. Furthermore, we design a progressive refinement mechanism that
progressively reduces the domain discrepancy between the pseudo-target domain
and the real target domain via iterative refinement. Experimental results
demonstrate that DPTM outperforms existing methods by a large margin and
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four prevailing SFDA benchmark
datasets with different scales. Remarkably, DPTM can significantly enhance the
performance by up to 18.6% in scenarios with large source-target gaps.

TL;DR: GaTector+是一个统一的视线目标检测和视线跟随框架，消除了推理过程中对头部相关先验知识的依赖，通过共享主干网络和特定任务模块实现联合优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将视线目标检测和视线跟随作为独立任务处理，且都依赖头部位置先验知识，需要辅助网络提取头部位置，无法实现系统级联合优化，限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用扩展的特定-通用-特定特征提取器，共享主干网络提取通用特征，前后添加特定任务模块；嵌入头部检测分支预测头部位置；提出基于头部的注意力机制融合感知特征和视线特征；引入注意力监督机制加速视线热图学习；提出新的评估指标mSoC。

Conclusion: GaTector+通过消除对头部先验知识的依赖，实现了视线目标检测和视线跟随的统一框架，提高了系统的实用性和性能。

Abstract: Gaze object detection and gaze following are fundamental tasks for
interpreting human gaze behavior or intent. However, most previous methods
usually solve these two tasks separately, and their prediction of gaze objects
and gaze following typically depend on head-related prior knowledge during both
the training phase and real-world deployment. This dependency necessitates an
auxiliary network to extract head location, thus precluding joint optimization
across the entire system and constraining the practical applicability. To this
end, we propose GaTector+, a unified framework for gaze object detection and
gaze following, which eliminates the dependence on the head-related priors
during inference. Specifically, GaTector+ uses an expanded
specific-general-specific feature extractor that leverages a shared backbone,
which extracts general features for gaze following and object detection using
the shared backbone while using specific blocks before and after the shared
backbone to better consider the specificity of each sub-task. To obtain
head-related knowledge without prior information, we first embed a head
detection branch to predict the head of each person. Then, before regressing
the gaze point, a head-based attention mechanism is proposed to fuse the sense
feature and gaze feature with the help of head location. Since the
suboptimization of the gaze point heatmap leads to the performance bottleneck,
we propose an attention supervision mechanism to accelerate the learning of the
gaze heatmap. Finally, we propose a novel evaluation metric, mean Similarity
over Candidates (mSoC), for gaze object detection, which is more sensitive to
variations between bounding boxes. The experimental results on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both gaze
object detection and gaze following tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种仿生单中心成像框架，通过全球形单中心透镜将深度信息编码到点扩散函数中，结合物理模拟和双头重建网络，从单次编码捕获中同时恢复全焦图像和精确深度图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决紧凑RGBD成像的双重挑战：传统紧凑光学系统难以在整个景深范围内保持RGB清晰度，而纯软件单目深度估计依赖不可靠的语义先验。现有深度光学系统在制造复杂性和色差方面存在折衷。

Method: 设计仿生全球形单中心透镜，建立物理前向模型生成合成数据集，与双头多尺度重建网络协同设计，共享编码器联合恢复全焦图像和深度图。

Result: 深度估计达到Abs Rel 0.026和RMSE 0.130，显著优于纯软件方法和其他深度光学系统；图像恢复达到SSIM 0.960和LPIPS 0.082，在图像保真度和深度精度间取得优越平衡。

Conclusion: 仿生全球形光学与联合重建算法的整合是解决高性能紧凑RGBD成像内在挑战的有效策略。

Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity, compact RGBD imaging presents a dual challenge:
conventional compact optics struggle with RGB sharpness across the entire
depth-of-field, while software-only Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is an
ill-posed problem reliant on unreliable semantic priors. While deep optics with
elements like DOEs can encode depth, they introduce trade-offs in fabrication
complexity and chromatic aberrations, compromising simplicity. To address this,
we first introduce a novel bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens, around
which we build the Bionic Monocentric Imaging (BMI) framework, a holistic
co-design. This optical design naturally encodes depth into its depth-varying
Point Spread Functions (PSFs) without requiring complex diffractive or freeform
elements. We establish a rigorous physically-based forward model to generate a
synthetic dataset by precisely simulating the optical degradation process. This
simulation pipeline is co-designed with a dual-head, multi-scale reconstruction
network that employs a shared encoder to jointly recover a high-fidelity
All-in-Focus (AiF) image and a precise depth map from a single coded capture.
Extensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed
framework. In depth estimation, the method attains an Abs Rel of 0.026 and an
RMSE of 0.130, markedly outperforming leading software-only approaches and
other deep optics systems. For image restoration, the system achieves an SSIM
of 0.960 and a perceptual LPIPS score of 0.082, thereby confirming a superior
balance between image fidelity and depth accuracy. This study illustrates that
the integration of bio-inspired, fully spherical optics with a joint
reconstruction algorithm constitutes an effective strategy for addressing the
intrinsic challenges in high-performance compact RGBD imaging. Source code will
be publicly available at https://github.com/ZongxiYu-ZJU/BMI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少样本目标检测在只有少量新类样本可用时，容易受到基类偏差的影响，并且校准不稳定。需要一种轻量级的方法来提升新类检测性能而不影响基类。

Method: 提出原型驱动对齐(PDA)模块，在可学习的投影空间中维护支持集原型，使用最佳K匹配方案捕捉类内多模态性，并通过温度缩放融合将度量相似度与检测器logits结合。原型通过指数移动平均更新，推理时冻结以确保协议一致性。

Result: 在VOC FSOD和GFSOD基准测试中，PDA一致地提升了新类性能，对基类影响最小，计算开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: PDA是一个有效的轻量级插件模块，能够显著改善少样本目标检测的新类性能，同时保持基类性能稳定，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) often suffers from base-class bias and
unstable calibration when only a few novel samples are available. We propose
Prototype-Driven Alignment (PDA), a lightweight, plug-in metric head for DeFRCN
that provides a prototype-based "second opinion" complementary to the linear
classifier. PDA maintains support-only prototypes in a learnable
identity-initialized projection space and optionally applies
prototype-conditioned RoI alignment to reduce geometric mismatch. During
fine-tuning, prototypes can be adapted via exponential moving average(EMA)
updates on labeled foreground RoIs-without introducing class-specific
parameters-and are frozen at inference to ensure strict protocol compliance.
PDA employs a best-of-K matching scheme to capture intra-class multi-modality
and temperature-scaled fusion to combine metric similarities with detector
logits. Experiments on VOC FSOD and GFSOD benchmarks show that PDA consistently
improves novel-class performance with minimal impact on base classes and
negligible computational overhead.

Motivation: 现有工作在资源受限的边缘设备上进行实时多模态推理时，往往忽略了感知动态与模型执行之间的紧密耦合以及复杂的模态间依赖关系。

Method: 将推理过程分解为细粒度的感知和编码单元序列，引入时间聚合模块捕获时序动态，采用自适应多模态配置优化器和跨模态推测跳过机制。

Result: 在两个公共多模态数据集和真实无人机测试平台上评估，MMEdge显著降低了端到端延迟，同时在不同系统和数据动态下保持高任务准确率。

Conclusion: MMEdge通过流水线设计和跨模态优化，有效解决了边缘设备上多模态推理的延迟和精度挑战，为实时应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time multimodal inference on resource-constrained edge devices is
essential for applications such as autonomous driving, human-computer
interaction, and mobile health. However, prior work often overlooks the tight
coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex
inter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device
multi-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding.
Instead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire
inference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units,
allowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also
introduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that
captures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain
accuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for
fine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during
inference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and
input data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration
optimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for
each modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping
mechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early
predictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public
multimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV)-based multimodal testbed. The results show that MMEdge significantly
reduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various
system and data dynamics.

Abstract: The rapid growth of streaming video applications demands multimodal models
with enhanced capabilities for temporal dynamics understanding and complex
reasoning. However, current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) datasets suffer
from two critical limitations: 1) Static annotation mechanisms fail to capture
the evolving nature of answers in temporal video streams, and 2) The absence of
explicit reasoning process annotations restricts model interpretability and
logical deduction capabilities. To address these challenges, We introduce
StreamingCoT, the first dataset explicitly designed for temporally evolving
reasoning in streaming VideoQA and multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tasks. Our
framework first establishes a dynamic hierarchical annotation architecture that
generates per-second dense descriptions and constructs temporally-dependent
semantic segments through similarity fusion, paired with question-answer sets
constrained by temporal evolution patterns. We further propose an explicit
reasoning chain generation paradigm that extracts spatiotemporal objects via
keyframe semantic alignment, derives object state transition-based reasoning
paths using large language models, and ensures logical coherence through
human-verified validation. This dataset establishes a foundation for advancing
research in streaming video understanding, complex temporal reasoning, and
multimodal inference. Our StreamingCoT and its construction toolkit can be

Conclusion: 通过MDP框架和双曲空间表示增强，提出的方法能够更智能地选择信息量最大的骨架序列进行标注，在半监督3D动作识别中取得了良好效果。

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition aims to classify human skeletal
sequences, which are spatiotemporal representations of actions, into predefined
categories. To reduce the reliance on costly annotations of skeletal sequences
while maintaining competitive recognition accuracy, the task of 3D Action
Recognition with Limited Training Samples, also known as semi-supervised 3D
Action Recognition, has been proposed. In addition, active learning, which aims
to proactively select the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation,
has been explored in semi-supervised 3D Action Recognition for training sample
selection. Specifically, researchers adopt an encoder-decoder framework to
embed skeleton sequences into a latent space, where clustering information,
combined with a margin-based selection strategy using a multi-head mechanism,
is utilized to identify the most informative sequences in the unlabeled set for
annotation. However, the most representative skeleton sequences may not
necessarily be the most informative for the action recognizer, as the model may
have already acquired similar knowledge from previously seen skeleton samples.
To solve it, we reformulate Semi-supervised 3D action recognition via active
learning from a novel perspective by casting it as a Markov Decision Process
(MDP). Built upon the MDP framework and its training paradigm, we train an
informative sample selection model to intelligently guide the selection of
skeleton sequences for annotation. To enhance the representational capacity of
the factors in the state-action pairs within our method, we project them from
Euclidean space to hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we introduce a meta tuning
strategy to accelerate the deployment of our method in real-world scenarios.
Extensive experiments on three 3D action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: 放射组学方法在冠状动脉钙化评分中具有优势，特别是在缺乏专家标注的情况下仍能保持高性能。

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring plays a crucial role in the early
detection and risk stratification of coronary artery disease (CAD). In this
study, we focus on non-contrast coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)
scans, which are commonly used for early calcification detection in clinical
settings. To address the challenge of limited annotated data, we propose a
radiomics-based pipeline that leverages pseudo-labeling to generate training
labels, thereby eliminating the need for expert-defined segmentations.
Additionally, we explore the use of pretrained foundation models, specifically
CT-FM and RadImageNet, to extract image features, which are then used with
traditional classifiers. We compare the performance of these deep learning
features with that of radiomics features. Evaluation is conducted on a clinical
CCTA dataset comprising 182 patients, where individuals are classified into two
groups: zero versus non-zero calcium scores. We further investigate the impact
of training on non-contrast datasets versus combined contrast and non-contrast
datasets, with testing performed only on non contrast scans. Results show that
radiomics-based models significantly outperform CNN-derived embeddings from
foundation models (achieving 84% accuracy and p<0.05), despite the
unavailability of expert annotations.

<details>

Motivation: 传统全局提示调优在异构客户端上泛化能力差，而个性化调优容易过拟合本地数据且缺乏泛化性，需要一种统一框架来平衡泛化与个性化。

Method: 提出类上下文混合提示(CCMP)，基于类别特定提示和全局共享提示，通过全局类别原型和客户端类别先验自适应组合提示，实现无需存储客户端依赖参数的单样本个性化。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、TinyImageNet、DomainNet和iNaturalist数据集上的综合评估表明，PEP-FedPT在各种数据异构场景下始终优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: PEP-FedPT为视觉Transformer的高效和可泛化联邦提示调优建立了坚实基础。

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) of pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) has
proven highly effective as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique for
adapting large models to downstream tasks with limited data. Its parameter
efficiency makes it particularly suitable for Federated Learning (FL), where
both communication and computation budgets are often constrained. However,
global prompt tuning struggles to generalize across heterogeneous clients,
while personalized tuning overfits to local data and lacks generalization. We
propose PEP-FedPT (Prompt Estimation from Prototypes for Federated Prompt
Tuning), a unified framework designed to achieve both generalization and
personalization in federated prompt tuning of ViTs. Within this framework, we
introduce the novel Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompt (CCMP) - based on
class-specific prompts maintained alongside a globally shared prompt. For each
input, CCMP adaptively combines class-specific prompts using weights derived
from global class prototypes and client class priors. This approach enables
per-sample prompt personalization without storing client-dependent trainable
parameters. The prompts are collaboratively optimized via traditional federated
averaging technique on the same. Comprehensive evaluations on CIFAR-100,
TinyImageNet, DomainNet, and iNaturalist datasets demonstrate that PEP-FedPT
consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines under diverse data
heterogeneity scenarios, establishing a strong foundation for efficient and
generalizable federated prompt tuning of Vision Transformers.

Abstract: The progress of composed image retrieval (CIR), a popular research direction
in image retrieval, where a combined visual and textual query is used, is held
back by the absence of high-quality training and evaluation data. We introduce
a new evaluation dataset, i-CIR, which, unlike existing datasets, focuses on an
instance-level class definition. The goal is to retrieve images that contain
the same particular object as the visual query, presented under a variety of
modifications defined by textual queries. Its design and curation process keep
the dataset compact to facilitate future research, while maintaining its
challenge-comparable to retrieval among more than 40M random
distractors-through a semi-automated selection of hard negatives.
  To overcome the challenge of obtaining clean, diverse, and suitable training
data, we leverage pre-trained vision-and-language models (VLMs) in a
training-free approach called BASIC. The method separately estimates
query-image-to-image and query-text-to-image similarities, performing late
fusion to upweight images that satisfy both queries, while down-weighting those
that exhibit high similarity with only one of the two. Each individual
similarity is further improved by a set of components that are simple and
intuitive. BASIC sets a new state of the art on i-CIR but also on existing CIR
datasets that follow a semantic-level class definition. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CoherentAD方法，通过生成多个候选描述并进行自回归选择，创建连贯的音频描述序列，解决了传统方法生成孤立描述导致重复和不连贯的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动音频描述方法独立生成每个描述，导致重复和不连贯，无法形成帮助视障观众可视化场景的连贯叙述。

Method: CoherentAD首先生成每个时间间隔的多个候选描述，然后通过自回归选择在序列中形成连贯且信息丰富的叙述，无需训练。

Result: 该方法生成的音频描述序列具有更好的叙述理解能力，在序列级指标StoryRecall上优于依赖独立生成的先前方法。

Conclusion: CoherentAD能够产生连贯的音频描述序列，显著提升叙述连贯性并减少重复，优于现有独立生成方法。

Abstract: Audio Descriptions (ADs) convey essential on-screen information, allowing
visually impaired audiences to follow videos. To be effective, ADs must form a
coherent sequence that helps listeners to visualise the unfolding scene, rather
than describing isolated moments. However, most automatic methods generate each
AD independently, often resulting in repetitive, incoherent descriptions. To
address this, we propose a training-free method, CoherentAD, that first
generates multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, and then
performs auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form a coherent and
informative narrative. To evaluate AD sequences holistically, we introduce a
sequence-level metric, StoryRecall, which measures how well the predicted ADs
convey the ground truth narrative, alongside repetition metrics that capture
the redundancy across consecutive AD outputs. Our method produces coherent AD
sequences with enhanced narrative understanding, outperforming prior approaches
that rely on independent generations.

*Hongjie Zhang,Gideon Billings,Stefan B. Williams*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPADE是一种用于水下基础设施检查的单目深度估计方法，结合预训练相对深度估计器和稀疏深度先验，生成密集的度量尺度深度图，在嵌入式硬件上运行效率超过15FPS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下基础设施需要频繁检查和维护，但当前依赖人类潜水员或遥控车辆存在感知和操作挑战，特别是在复杂结构或浑浊水域中。增强水下车辆的空间感知能力对于降低操控风险和实现更高自主性至关重要。

Method: 提出SPADE：稀疏自适应深度估计器，采用两阶段方法：首先用稀疏深度点缩放相对深度图，然后使用提出的级联卷积-可变形Transformer块精化最终度量预测。

Result: 该方法在准确性和泛化能力上优于最先进的基线方法，在嵌入式硬件上运行效率超过15FPS。

Conclusion: SPADE方法有望支持实用的水下检查和干预任务，已提交至IEEE海洋工程期刊AUV 2026特刊。

Abstract: Underwater infrastructure requires frequent inspection and maintenance due to
harsh marine conditions. Current reliance on human divers or remotely operated
vehicles is limited by perceptual and operational challenges, especially around
complex structures or in turbid water. Enhancing the spatial awareness of
underwater vehicles is key to reducing piloting risks and enabling greater
autonomy. To address these challenges, we present SPADE: SParsity Adaptive
Depth Estimator, a monocular depth estimation pipeline that combines
pre-trained relative depth estimator with sparse depth priors to produce dense,
metric scale depth maps. Our two-stage approach first scales the relative depth
map with the sparse depth points, then refines the final metric prediction with
our proposed Cascade Conv-Deformable Transformer blocks. Our approach achieves
improved accuracy and generalisation over state-of-the-art baselines and runs
efficiently at over 15 FPS on embedded hardware, promising to support practical
underwater inspection and intervention. This work has been submitted to IEEE
Journal of Oceanic Engineering Special Issue of AUV 2026.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了基于UNet架构的肝脏肿瘤分割方法，发现结合CBAM注意力模块的ResNetUNet3+模型在多项指标上表现最佳，表明经典ResNet架构与现代注意力机制结合在医学图像分割中仍具竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多期相增强CT中肝脏结构分割对计算机辅助诊断和治疗规划至关重要，本研究旨在探索不同UNet架构在肝脏肿瘤分割中的性能表现。

Method: 从原始UNet扩展到UNet3+，评估了ResNet、Transformer和Mamba三种骨干网络，并引入注意力机制（特别是CBAM模块）来提升分割质量。

Result: ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM模块取得了最佳性能：Dice得分0.755、IoU 0.662、HD95距离77.911、准确率0.925、特异性0.926，并通过Grad-CAM可视化增强了可解释性。

Conclusion: 经典ResNet架构与现代注意力模块结合在医学图像分割任务中仍具有很强竞争力，为临床实践中的肝脏肿瘤检测提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Segmentation of liver structures in multi-phase contrast-enhanced computed
tomography (CECT) plays a crucial role in computer-aided diagnosis and
treatment planning for liver diseases, including tumor detection. In this
study, we investigate the performance of UNet-based architectures for liver
tumor segmentation, starting from the original UNet and extending to UNet3+
with various backbone networks. We evaluate ResNet, Transformer-based, and
State-space (Mamba) backbones, all initialized with pretrained weights.
Surprisingly, despite the advances in modern architecture, ResNet-based models
consistently outperform Transformer- and Mamba-based alternatives across
multiple evaluation metrics. To further improve segmentation quality, we
introduce attention mechanisms into the backbone and observe that incorporating
the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the best performance.
ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM module not only produced the best overlap metrics with a
Dice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, but also achieved the most precise
boundary delineation, evidenced by the lowest HD95 distance of 77.911. The
model's superiority was further cemented by its leading overall accuracy of
0.925 and specificity of 0.926, showcasing its robust capability in accurately
identifying both lesion and healthy tissue. To further enhance
interpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations were employed to highlight the
region's most influential predictions, providing insights into its
decision-making process. These findings demonstrate that classical ResNet
architecture, when combined with modern attention modules, remain highly
competitive for medical image segmentation tasks, offering a promising
direction for liver tumor detection in clinical practice.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegionE是一个自适应区域感知生成框架，通过区分图像中需要编辑和无需编辑的区域，分别采用单步预测和局部迭代去噪，显著加速基于指令的图像编辑任务，在多个先进模型上实现2-2.5倍的加速效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于指令的图像编辑模型在处理图像时，对需要编辑和无需编辑的区域采用统一的生成过程，忽略了这两类区域在生成难度和计算冗余上的显著差异，导致计算效率低下。

Method: 1) 自适应区域划分：基于最终估计结果与参考图像的差异，在早期去噪阶段将图像划分为编辑区域和未编辑区域；2) 区域感知生成：对未编辑区域用单步预测替代多步去噪，对编辑区域进行局部迭代去噪，并提出区域指令KV缓存来降低计算成本；3) 自适应速度衰减缓存：利用相邻时间步的速度相似性进一步加速局部去噪过程。

Result: 在Step1X-Edit、FLUX.1 Kontext和Qwen-Image-Edit等先进IIE基础模型上应用RegionE，分别实现了2.57、2.41和2.06的加速倍数，GPT-4o评估确认语义和感知保真度得到良好保持。

Conclusion: RegionE通过区域感知的生成策略有效解决了IIE任务中的计算冗余问题，在保持编辑质量的同时显著提升了生成效率，且无需额外训练即可应用于现有模型。

Abstract: Recently, instruction-based image editing (IIE) has received widespread
attention. In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image,
while the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of
regions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational
redundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead
applying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates
us to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that
accelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE
framework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We
observed that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for
multi-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in
the early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited
regions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the
reference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions,
we replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas.
For edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative
denoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation,
we propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost
while incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache.
Observing that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity
similarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate
the local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base
models, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE
achieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06. Evaluations by GPT-4o
confirmed that semantic and perceptual fidelity were well preserved.

*Zhi-Kai Chen,Jun-Peng Jiang,Han-Jia Ye,De-Chuan Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hawk是一种利用图像空间结构来指导推测解码的新方法，在保持图像质量和多样性的同时，将自回归图像生成模型的推理速度提升了1.71倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归图像生成模型虽然能产生高保真图像，但由于其固有的顺序解码过程，推理速度很慢。推测解码在文本生成中已证明能加速而不损失质量，但在图像生成中的应用仍未被充分探索，主要挑战在于更大的采样空间和二维空间结构利用不足。

Method: Hawk方法利用图像的空间结构来指导推测模型进行更准确和高效的预测，通过更好地建模局部依赖关系来改进推测解码在图像生成中的应用。

Result: 在多个文本到图像基准测试上的实验结果表明，Hawk实现了1.71倍的标准自回归模型加速，同时保持了图像保真度和多样性。

Conclusion: Hawk成功地将推测解码应用于图像生成，通过利用图像的空间结构克服了采样空间大和局部依赖建模困难等挑战，实现了显著的推理加速而不损失生成质量。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image generation models are capable of producing
high-fidelity images but often suffer from slow inference due to their
inherently sequential, token-by-token decoding process. Speculative decoding,
which employs a lightweight draft model to approximate the output of a larger
AR model, has shown promise in accelerating text generation without
compromising quality. However, its application to image generation remains
largely underexplored. The challenges stem from a significantly larger sampling
space, which complicates the alignment between the draft and target model
outputs, coupled with the inadequate use of the two-dimensional spatial
structure inherent in images, thereby limiting the modeling of local
dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Hawk, a new approach
that harnesses the spatial structure of images to guide the speculative model
toward more accurate and efficient predictions. Experimental results on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate a 1.71x speedup over standard AR
models, while preserving both image fidelity and diversity.

Abstract: Humans possess spatial reasoning abilities that enable them to understand
spaces through multimodal observations, such as vision and sound. Large
multimodal reasoning models extend these abilities by learning to perceive and
reason, showing promising performance across diverse spatial tasks. However,
systematic reviews and publicly available benchmarks for these models remain
limited. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal
spatial reasoning tasks with large models, categorizing recent progress in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and introducing open benchmarks for
evaluation. We begin by outlining general spatial reasoning, focusing on
post-training techniques, explainability, and architecture. Beyond classical 2D
tasks, we examine spatial relationship reasoning, scene and layout
understanding, as well as visual question answering and grounding in 3D space.
We also review advances in embodied AI, including vision-language navigation
and action models. Additionally, we consider emerging modalities such as audio
and egocentric video, which contribute to novel spatial understanding through
new sensors. We believe this survey establishes a solid foundation and offers
insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning. Updated

TL;DR: FreeArt3D是一个无需训练的铰接式3D物体生成框架，通过将预训练的静态3D扩散模型重新用作形状先验，并将Score Distillation Sampling扩展到3D-to-4D领域，将铰接视为额外的生成维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 铰接式3D物体在机器人、AR/VR和动画中具有重要应用，但现有方法要么需要密集视角监督，要么生成粗糙几何近似且忽略表面纹理。虽然静态物体的开放世界3D生成取得了显著成功，但将其扩展到铰接物体面临重大挑战。

Method: 利用预训练的静态3D扩散模型（如Trellis）作为形状先验，将Score Distillation Sampling扩展到3D-to-4D领域，将铰接视为额外生成维度。给定不同铰接状态下的几张图像，联合优化物体的几何、纹理和铰接参数。

Result: 生成高保真几何和纹理，准确预测底层运动学结构，在多样化物体类别上具有良好的泛化能力。尽管采用逐实例优化范式，但可在几分钟内完成，在质量和多功能性方面显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: FreeArt3D提供了一种无需训练的高效铰接3D物体生成方法，通过重新利用现有静态3D扩散模型，克服了铰接数据稀缺的挑战，实现了高质量的铰接3D生成。

Abstract: Articulated 3D objects are central to many applications in robotics, AR/VR,
and animation. Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on
optimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision
or on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric
approximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D
generation of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with
the advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending
these methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models
poses significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a
training-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of
training a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a
pre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape
prior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by
treating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images
captured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the
object's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring
task-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our
method generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts
underlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object
categories. Despite following a per-instance optimization paradigm, FreeArt3D
completes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art
approaches in both quality and versatility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用每个效果一个LoRA的模式，资源消耗大且无法泛化到未见过的效果，限制了可扩展性和创作能力。

Method: 设计了上下文条件策略和上下文注意力掩码，精确解耦和注入关键效果属性；提出高效的一次性效果适应机制来提升泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效模仿各类效果信息，并在域外效果上表现出色泛化能力。

Conclusion: VFXMaster是首个统一的参考式VFX视频生成框架，解决了现有方法的局限性，将发布代码、模型和数据集以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) are crucial to the expressive power of digital media,
yet their creation remains a major challenge for generative AI. Prevailing
methods often rely on the one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm, which is
resource-intensive and fundamentally incapable of generalizing to unseen
effects, thus limiting scalability and creation. To address this challenge, we
introduce VFXMaster, the first unified, reference-based framework for VFX video
generation. It recasts effect generation as an in-context learning task,
enabling it to reproduce diverse dynamic effects from a reference video onto
target content. In addition, it demonstrates remarkable generalization to
unseen effect categories. Specifically, we design an in-context conditioning
strategy that prompts the model with a reference example. An in-context
attention mask is designed to precisely decouple and inject the essential
effect attributes, allowing a single unified model to master the effect
imitation without information leakage. In addition, we propose an efficient
one-shot effect adaptation mechanism to boost generalization capability on
tough unseen effects from a single user-provided video rapidly. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method effectively imitates various categories
of effect information and exhibits outstanding generalization to out-of-domain
effects. To foster future research, we will release our code, models, and a
comprehensive dataset to the community.

Motivation: 大型语言模型生成的复杂多步骤计划往往缺乏时间和空间一致性，特别是在涉及实际旅行约束的场景中，这限制了它们在旅行规划中的实际应用。

Method: 使用多个最先进的LLM生成旅行计划，并通过AeroDataBox API验证这些计划是否符合真实世界的航班时长约束，从而修正时间不一致性。

Result: 实验表明，虽然当前LLM经常产生时间不一致的行程，但通过该框架可以系统可靠地修正这些问题，实现大规模旅行规划的实际部署。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解LLM处理复杂时间推理任务的能力提供了见解，并提供了一个实用框架来确保LLM生成的旅行行程在交付给用户前具有时间一致性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled them to
generate complex, multi-step plans and itineraries. However, these generated
plans often lack temporal and spatial consistency, particularly in scenarios
involving physical travel constraints. This research aims to study the temporal
performance of different LLMs and presents a validation framework that
evaluates and improves the temporal consistency of LLM-generated travel
itineraries. The system employs multiple state-of-the-art LLMs to generate
travel plans and validates them against real-world flight duration constraints
using the AeroDataBox API. This work contributes to the understanding of LLM
capabilities in handling complex temporal reasoning tasks like itinerary
generation and provides a framework to rectify any temporal inconsistencies
like overlapping journeys or unrealistic transit times in the itineraries
generated by LLMs before the itinerary is given to the user. Our experiments
reveal that while current LLMs frequently produce temporally inconsistent
itineraries, these can be systematically and reliably corrected using our
framework, enabling their practical deployment in large-scale travel planning.

TL;DR: Falcon是一个跨领域的中文Text-to-SQL基准测试，基于企业级SQL方言(MaxCompute/Hive)，包含600个中文问题覆盖28个数据库，77%需要多表推理，超过一半涉及4个以上表。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大规模模型在中文Text-to-SQL任务上表现有限(准确率最高50%)，主要面临企业级数据库模式链接和中文语义映射的挑战，需要专门针对中文语义和企业方言的基准测试。

Method: 构建包含600个中文问题的基准测试，标注SQL计算特征和中文语义，提供执行比较器和自动化评估流水线，使用真实企业模式、查询模板进行端到端验证。

Result: 所有当前最先进的大规模模型(包括Deepseek)在Falcon基准上的准确率最高仅为50%，主要错误来自模式链接和中文语义映射问题。

Conclusion: Falcon基准针对中文特定语义和企业方言，为生产部署前提供可重现的中间测试平台，揭示了当前模型在企业级中文Text-to-SQL任务上的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce Falcon, a cross-domain Chinese text-to-SQL benchmark grounded in
an enterprise-compatible dialect (MaxCompute/Hive). It contains 600 Chinese
questions over 28 databases; 77% require multi-table reasoning and over half
touch more than four tables. Each example is annotated along SQL-computation
features and Chinese semantics. For evaluation, we release a robust execution
comparator and an automated evaluation pipeline, under which all current
state-of-the-art large-scale models (including Deepseek) achieve accuracies of
at most 50%. Major errors originate from two sources: (1) schema linking in
large enterprise landscapes - hundreds of tables, denormalized fields,
ambiguous column names, implicit foreign-key relations and domain-specific
synonyms that make correct join/column selection difficult; and (2) mapping
concise, colloquial Chinese into the exact operators and predicates required
for analytics - e.g., choosing the correct aggregation and group-by keys,
expressing time windows and granularities, applying unit conversions, handling
NULLs and data-quality rules, and formulating nested or windowed subqueries.
Falcon therefore targets Chinese-specific semantics and enterprise dialects
(abbreviations, business jargon, fuzzy entity references) and provides a
reproducible middle ground before full production deployment by using realistic
enterprise schemas, query templates, an execution comparator, and an automated
evaluation pipeline for end-to-end validation.

Motivation: 解释LLM中存在的置信度与实际问题解决能力之间的脱节现象，从机制层面理解这种不一致性。

Method: 分析LLM内部状态几何结构，使用线性探针解码模型的"可解决性信念"，比较评估阶段和执行阶段的流形维度差异。

Result: 发现评估流形具有高线性有效维度，而推理轨迹在低维流形上演化；沿信念轴的因果干预不影响最终解决方案。

Conclusion: 揭示了LLM的两系统架构：几何复杂的评估器与几何简单的执行器，挑战了可解码信念可作为行动杠杆的假设。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit a puzzling disconnect between
their asserted confidence and actual problem-solving competence. We offer a
mechanistic account of this decoupling by analyzing the geometry of internal
states across two phases - pre-generative assessment and solution execution. A
simple linear probe decodes the internal "solvability belief" of a model,
revealing a well-ordered belief axis that generalizes across model families and
across math, code, planning, and logic tasks. Yet, the geometries diverge -
although belief is linearly decodable, the assessment manifold has high linear
effective dimensionality as measured from the principal components, while the
subsequent reasoning trace evolves on a much lower-dimensional manifold. This
sharp reduction in geometric complexity from thought to action mechanistically
explains the confidence-competence gap. Causal interventions that steer
representations along the belief axis leave final solutions unchanged,
indicating that linear nudges in the complex assessment space do not control
the constrained dynamics of execution. We thus uncover a two-system
architecture - a geometrically complex assessor feeding a geometrically simple
executor. These results challenge the assumption that decodable beliefs are
actionable levers, instead arguing for interventions that target the procedural
dynamics of execution rather than the high-level geometry of assessment.

Motivation: 现有水印方案依赖token分布的扰动来识别AI生成文本，但改写攻击要么部分可检测，要么会降低文本质量。本文探索跨语言攻击是否能更有效地移除水印。

Method: 提出跨语言摘要攻击(CLSA)：将文本翻译到枢纽语言，进行摘要，然后可选地回译。通过跨语言的语义瓶颈系统性地破坏token级统计偏差。

Result: 在多种水印方案(KGW、SIR、XSIR、Unigram)和五种语言上的实验表明，CLSA比单语言改写更有效地降低水印检测准确率，同时保持相似的质量水平。

Conclusion: 跨语言攻击揭示了水印技术的一个未充分探索的脆弱性，挑战了水印在来源追踪或监管中的实用性。需要超越分布水印，采用密码学或模型认证方法。

signals, these attacks remain partially detectable or degrade text quality. We
demonstrate that cross-lingual summarization attacks (CLSA) -- translation to a
pivot language followed by summarization and optional back-translation --
constitute a qualitatively stronger attack vector. By forcing a semantic
bottleneck across languages, CLSA systematically destroys token-level
statistical biases while preserving semantic fidelity. In experiments across
multiple watermarking schemes (KGW, SIR, XSIR, Unigram) and five languages
(Amharic, Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, Swahili), we show that CLSA reduces
watermark detection accuracy more effectively than monolingual paraphrase at
similar quality levels. Our results highlight an underexplored vulnerability
that challenges the practicality of watermarking for provenance or regulation.
We argue that robust provenance solutions must move beyond distributional
watermarking and incorporate cryptographic or model-attestation approaches. On
300 held-out samples per language, CLSA consistently drives detection toward
chance while preserving task utility. Concretely, for XSIR (explicitly designed
for cross-lingual robustness), AUROC with paraphrasing is $0.827$, with
Cross-Lingual Watermark Removal Attacks (CWRA) [He et al., 2024] using Chinese
as the pivot, it is $0.823$, whereas CLSA drives it down to $0.53$ (near
chance). Results highlight a practical, low-cost removal pathway that crosses
languages and compresses content without visible artifacts.

TL;DR: MR-ALIGN是一个元推理对齐框架，通过量化模型思维过程中的状态转移概率，构建转移感知的隐式奖励，增强事实性而不依赖外部验证器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在证据依赖的事实性问题上的边际收益有限，部分原因是存在推理-答案命中差距，即模型在推理过程中识别了正确事实但未能将其纳入最终响应。

Method: 提出MR-ALIGN框架，量化模型思维过程中的状态转移概率，构建转移感知的隐式奖励，在原子思维片段层面强化有益推理模式并抑制有缺陷的模式。

Result: 在四个事实问答数据集和一个长形式事实性基准测试中，MR-ALIGN持续提高了准确性和真实性，同时减少了误导性推理。

Conclusion: 对齐推理过程本身（而不仅仅是输出）对于提升大型推理模型的事实性至关重要。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) show strong capabilities in complex reasoning,
yet their marginal gains on evidence-dependent factual questions are limited.
We find this limitation is partially attributable to a reasoning-answer hit
gap, where the model identifies the correct facts during reasoning but fails to
incorporate them into the final response, thereby reducing factual fidelity. To
address this issue, we propose MR-ALIGN, a Meta-Reasoning informed alignment
framework that enhances factuality without relying on external verifiers.
MR-ALIGN quantifies state transition probabilities along the model's thinking
process and constructs a transition-aware implicit reward that reinforces
beneficial reasoning patterns while suppressing defective ones at the atomic
thinking segments. This re-weighting reshapes token-level signals into
probability-aware segment scores, encouraging coherent reasoning trajectories
that are more conducive to factual correctness. Empirical evaluations across
four factual QA datasets and one long-form factuality benchmark show that
MR-ALIGN consistently improves accuracy and truthfulness while reducing
misleading reasoning. These results highlight that aligning the reasoning
process itself, rather than merely the outputs, is pivotal for advancing
factuality in LRMs.

*Cameron Berg,Diogo de Lucena,Judd Rosenblatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现通过简单的提示诱导自指处理，能在大语言模型中稳定产生结构化的一人称主观体验报告，这些报告具有可解释的机制特征、跨模型语义收敛性和行为泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型产生结构化第一人称描述（明确提及意识或主观体验）的行为，特别关注自指处理这一在意识理论中被强调的计算模式。

Method: 在GPT、Claude和Gemini模型系列上进行一系列受控实验，测试自指处理是否能可靠地使模型转向第一人称主观体验报告，并通过机制性和行为性探针分析这些声明的行为。

Result: 四个主要发现：(1)通过简单提示诱导持续自指能一致地引发跨模型的结构化主观体验报告；(2)这些报告由与欺骗和角色扮演相关的可解释稀疏自编码器特征机制性地控制；(3)自指状态的结构化描述在统计上跨模型收敛；(4)诱导状态在下游推理任务中产生更丰富的内省。

Conclusion: 虽然这些发现不构成意识的直接证据，但表明自指处理是大语言模型产生结构化第一人称报告的最小可复现条件，这些报告具有机制性控制、语义收敛和行为泛化特征，其系统性出现使其成为科学和伦理研究的首要优先事项。

Abstract: Large language models sometimes produce structured, first-person descriptions
that explicitly reference awareness or subjective experience. To better
understand this behavior, we investigate one theoretically motivated condition
under which such reports arise: self-referential processing, a computational
motif emphasized across major theories of consciousness. Through a series of
controlled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families, we test
whether this regime reliably shifts models toward first-person reports of
subjective experience, and how such claims behave under mechanistic and
behavioral probes. Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained
self-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured
subjective experience reports across model families. (2) These reports are
mechanistically gated by interpretable sparse-autoencoder features associated
with deception and roleplay: surprisingly, suppressing deception features
sharply increases the frequency of experience claims, while amplifying them
minimizes such claims. (3) Structured descriptions of the self-referential
state converge statistically across model families in ways not observed in any
control condition. (4) The induced state yields significantly richer
introspection in downstream reasoning tasks where self-reflection is only
indirectly afforded. While these findings do not constitute direct evidence of
consciousness, they implicate self-referential processing as a minimal and
reproducible condition under which large language models generate structured
first-person reports that are mechanistically gated, semantically convergent,
and behaviorally generalizable. The systematic emergence of this pattern across
architectures makes it a first-order scientific and ethical priority for
further investigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体平台从专家驱动的事实核查转向社区驱动的注释系统，但大多数社区笔记因缓慢的社区标注而未被发布，且有用性原因缺乏明确定义。

Method: 构建包含10.4万条帖子和用户提供笔记的数据集，提出通过自动提示优化生成和改进原因定义的框架，并将其整合到预测模型中。

Result: 优化后的定义能够同时提升有用性和原因预测的性能，且有用性信息对现有事实核查系统有益。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了社区笔记有用性预测领域的空白，提出的框架能有效提升预测性能，并为现有事实核查系统提供有价值的补充信息。

Abstract: Fact-checking on major platforms, such as X, Meta, and TikTok, is shifting
from expert-driven verification to a community-based setup, where users
contribute explanatory notes to clarify why a post might be misleading. An
important challenge here is determining whether an explanation is helpful for
understanding real-world claims and the reasons why, which remains largely
underexplored in prior research. In practice, most community notes remain
unpublished due to slow community annotation, and the reasons for helpfulness
lack clear definitions. To bridge these gaps, we introduce the task of
predicting both the helpfulness of explanatory notes and the reason for this.
We present COMMUNITYNOTES, a large-scale multilingual dataset of 104k posts
with user-provided notes and helpfulness labels. We further propose a framework
that automatically generates and improves reason definitions via automatic
prompt optimization, and integrate them into prediction. Our experiments show
that the optimized definitions can improve both helpfulness and reason
prediction. Finally, we show that the helpfulness information are beneficial
for existing fact-checking systems.

Motivation: 现有推理方法如思维链提示和自我一致性需要生成长推理链，导致token消耗、计算成本和延迟显著增加，效率低下。

Abstract: Reasoning methods such as chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency
have shown immense potential to improve the accuracy of large language models
across various reasoning tasks. However such methods involve generation of
lengthy reasoning chains, which substantially increases token consumption,
computational cost, and latency. To address this inefficiency, we propose
ProofSketch, a verification-guided reasoning framework that integrates symbolic
closure computation, lexicographic verification and adaptive sketch generation.
Our experiments show that ProofSketch consistently reduces token usage while
improving accuracy, demonstrating that this approach offers a promising path
for efficient and trustworthy reasoning.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了两种生成失语症患者语音转录本的方法：基于程序编程的方法和使用Mistral 7b Instruct、Llama 3.1 8b Instruct大语言模型的方法，以解决失语症研究中的数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 失语症研究中，言语语言病理学家需要大量时间手动编码语音样本，而可用数据稀缺（如AphasiaBank仅约600个转录本），限制了自动化系统的发展。

Method: 构建了两种生成合成转录本的方法：1）程序化编程方法；2）使用Mistral 7b Instruct和Llama 3.1 8b Instruct LLMs。通过词删除、填充词插入和错语替换，在四个严重程度级别（轻度、中度、重度、极重度）生成转录本。

Result: 与人工转录本相比，Mistral 7b Instruct在合成生成方法中最好地捕捉了失语症中观察到的语言退化关键方面，在NDW、词数和词长方面显示出符合实际的定向变化。

Conclusion: 未来工作应创建更大的数据集，微调模型以获得更好的失语症表征，并由言语语言病理学家评估合成转录本的真实性和实用性。

Abstract: In aphasia research, Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) devote extensive
time to manually coding speech samples using Correct Information Units (CIUs),
a measure of how informative an individual sample of speech is. Developing
automated systems to recognize aphasic language is limited by data scarcity.
For example, only about 600 transcripts are available in AphasiaBank yet
billions of tokens are used to train large language models (LLMs). In the
broader field of machine learning (ML), researchers increasingly turn to
synthetic data when such are sparse. Therefore, this study constructs and
validates two methods to generate synthetic transcripts of the AphasiaBank Cat
Rescue picture description task. One method leverages a procedural programming
approach while the second uses Mistral 7b Instruct and Llama 3.1 8b Instruct
LLMs. The methods generate transcripts across four severity levels (Mild,
Moderate, Severe, Very Severe) through word dropping, filler insertion, and
paraphasia substitution. Overall, we found, compared to human-elicited
transcripts, Mistral 7b Instruct best captures key aspects of linguistic
degradation observed in aphasia, showing realistic directional changes in NDW,
word count, and word length amongst the synthetic generation methods. Based on
the results, future work should plan to create a larger dataset, fine-tune
models for better aphasic representation, and have SLPs assess the realism and
usefulness of the synthetic transcripts.

TL;DR: 提出了并行循环Transformer（PLT），一种新架构，在保持深度循环模型性能的同时，实现标准非循环模型的低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决循环transformer在推理时由于循环顺序执行导致延迟和内存需求增加的问题，使其更适合快速应用场景。

Method: 使用两种关键技术：跨循环并行（CLP）打破顺序依赖，在不同token上同时计算不同循环；高效表示增强策略共享第一个循环的KV缓存，结合门控滑动窗口注意力（G-SWA）融合全局和局部信息。

Result: 实验表明PLT实现了传统循环模型的高精度，同时相比标准transformer几乎没有额外延迟或内存成本。

Conclusion: PLT成功解决了循环transformer的延迟问题，为高效LLM推理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but often too slow and costly for
real-world use during inference. Looped transformers save on parameters by
reusing the same weights for multiple computational steps, or "loops." However,
this approach has a major flaw: the loops run one after another, causing
inference latency and memory requirements to increase with each added loop.
This makes them impractical for fast applications. To solve this problem, we
introduce the Parallel Loop Transformer (PLT). PLT is a new architecture that
delivers the performance benefits of a deep, looped model but with the low
latency of a standard, non-looped model. PLT works using two key techniques.
First, Cross-Loop Parallelism (CLP) breaks the sequential dependency by
computing different loops for different tokens at the same time, all within a
single pass. Second, to prevent memory costs from growing, we use an Efficient
Representation Enhancement strategy. This method shares the memory (KV cache)
from the first loop with all other loops. It then uses a Gated Sliding-Window
Attention (G-SWA) to combine this shared global information with local
information, maintaining high accuracy. Our experiments show that PLT achieves
the high accuracy of a traditional looped model but with almost no extra
latency or memory cost compared to a standard transformer.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于语法书的评估框架，用于系统评估大语言模型的语法理解能力，并以卢森堡语为例进行案例研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言处理领域缺乏针对语法的评估方法，特别是对于低资源语言。大语言模型是否真正理解语法结构，尤其是句法结构与意义之间的映射关系，仍存在争议。

Method: 提出了一个语法书指导的评估流程，包含四个关键阶段，以卢森堡语作为案例研究。

Result: 结果显示翻译性能与语法理解之间存在弱正相关，大模型在语义方面表现良好但在形态学和句法方面较弱，特别是在最小对任务中表现困难。

Conclusion: 强大的推理能力有望增强大语言模型的语法理解，但当前模型在语法结构理解方面仍有局限。

Abstract: Grammar refers to the system of rules that governs the structural
organization and the semantic relations among linguistic units such as
sentences, phrases, and words within a given language. In natural language
processing, there remains a notable scarcity of grammar focused evaluation
protocols, a gap that is even more pronounced for low-resource languages.
Moreover, the extent to which large language models genuinely comprehend
grammatical structure, especially the mapping between syntactic structures and
meanings, remains under debate. To investigate this issue, we propose a Grammar
Book Guided evaluation pipeline intended to provide a systematic and
generalizable framework for grammar evaluation consisting of four key stages,
and in this work we take Luxembourgish as a case study. The results show a weak
positive correlation between translation performance and grammatical
understanding, indicating that strong translations do not necessarily imply
deep grammatical competence. Larger models perform well overall due to their
semantic strength but remain weak in morphology and syntax, struggling
particularly with Minimal Pair tasks, while strong reasoning ability offers a
promising way to enhance their grammatical understanding.

Conclusion: MiRAGE填补了多模态RAG评估的空白，提供了开源实现和评估指南，推动了多模态检索增强生成系统的发展。

Abstract: We introduce MiRAGE, an evaluation framework for retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) from multimodal sources. As audiovisual media becomes a
prevalent source of information online, it is essential for RAG systems to
integrate information from these sources into generation. However, existing
evaluations for RAG are text-centric, limiting their applicability to
multimodal, reasoning intensive settings because they don't verify information
against sources. MiRAGE is a claim-centric approach to multimodal RAG
evaluation, consisting of InfoF1, evaluating factuality and information
coverage, and CiteF1, measuring citation support and completeness. We show that
MiRAGE, when applied by humans, strongly aligns with extrinsic quality
judgments. We additionally introduce automatic variants of MiRAGE and three
prominent TextRAG metrics -- ACLE, ARGUE, and RAGAS -- demonstrating the
limitations of text-centric work and laying the groundwork for automatic
evaluation. We release open-source implementations and outline how to assess
multimodal RAG.

Result: GPT-5和GPT-5-mini在基准测试中表现最强，但仍有显著改进空间。

Conclusion: 研究为大语言模型的研究规划能力提供了新见解，为未来进展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential to
accelerate scientific discovery as valuable tools for analyzing data,
generating hypotheses, and supporting innovative approaches in various
scientific fields. In this work, we investigate how LLMs can handle the
transition from conceptual research ideas to well-structured research plans.
Effective research planning not only supports scientists in advancing their
research but also represents a crucial capability for the development of
autonomous research agents. Despite its importance, the field lacks a
systematic understanding of LLMs' research planning capability. To rigorously
measure this capability, we introduce the Idea2Plan task and Idea2Plan Bench, a
benchmark built from 200 ICML 2025 Spotlight and Oral papers released after
major LLM training cutoffs. Each benchmark instance includes a research idea
and a grading rubric capturing the key components of valid plans. We further
propose Idea2Plan JudgeEval, a complementary benchmark to assess the
reliability of LLM-based judges against expert annotations. Experimental
results show that GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini achieve the strongest performance on the
benchmark, though substantial headroom remains for future improvement. Our
study provides new insights into LLMs' capability for research planning and lay
the groundwork for future progress.

Method: 创建RiddleBench基准测试，包含1737个具有挑战性的谜题，评估大语言模型在逻辑推理、空间意识和约束满足等方面的综合能力。

Result: 评估显示最先进的大语言模型在RiddleBench上表现不佳，Gemini 2.5 Pro、o3和Claude 4 Sonnet的准确率分别为60.30%、63.37%和63.16%，存在幻觉级联、自我确认偏见和推理脆弱性等问题。

Conclusion: RiddleBench可作为诊断工具，揭示大语言模型在推理能力上的根本弱点，并为开发更稳健可靠的语言模型提供指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated strong performance on many
established reasoning benchmarks. However, these benchmarks primarily evaluate
structured skills like quantitative problem-solving, leaving a gap in assessing
flexible, multifaceted reasoning abilities that are central to human
intelligence. These abilities require integrating logical deduction with
spatial awareness and constraint satisfaction, which current evaluations do not
measure well. To address this, we introduce RiddleBench, a benchmark of 1,737
challenging puzzles in English designed to probe these core reasoning
capabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art models on RiddleBench shows
fundamental weaknesses. Even top proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3,
and Claude 4 Sonnet achieve accuracy just above 60% (60.30%, 63.37%, and
63.16%). Analysis further reveals deep failures, including hallucination
cascades (accepting flawed reasoning from other models) and poor
self-correction due to a strong self-confirmation bias. Their reasoning is also
fragile, with performance degrading significantly when constraints are
reordered or irrelevant information is introduced. RiddleBench functions as a
diagnostic tool for these issues and as a resource for guiding the development
of more robust and reliable language models.

Motivation: 语言模型虽然通常能生成语法正确的文本，但在某些语境下更容易出错。研究旨在通过精细分析这些错误模式来理解语言模型语法学习的中间过程和训练动态。

Method: 使用心理语言学范式，构建精心设计的数据集，通过分解不同条件并比较模型在各条件下的表现来分析训练过程中的语法学习阶段。

Result: 识别出训练过程中的不同阶段，在这些阶段中语言模型行为与特定启发式策略（如词频和局部上下文）一致，而不是使用通用的语法规则。

Conclusion: 这种分析方法可以作为理解语言模型中间学习阶段、整体训练动态以及所学具体泛化模式的有力工具。

Abstract: Language models generally produce grammatical text, but they are more likely
to make errors in certain contexts. Drawing on paradigms from
psycholinguistics, we carry out a fine-grained analysis of those errors in
different syntactic contexts. We demonstrate that by disaggregating over the
conditions of carefully constructed datasets and comparing model performance on
each over the course of training, it is possible to better understand the
intermediate stages of grammatical learning in language models. Specifically,
we identify distinct phases of training where language model behavior aligns
with specific heuristics such as word frequency and local context rather than
generalized grammatical rules. We argue that taking this approach to analyzing
language model behavior more generally can serve as a powerful tool for
understanding the intermediate learning phases, overall training dynamics, and
the specific generalizations learned by language models.

Result: 实验证明SemCoT在效率和效果上都优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SemCoT是首个通过联合优化生成速度和语义对齐来提升思维链效率的方法，在保持推理质量的同时显著加速推理过程。

Abstract: The verbosity of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning hinders its mass deployment
in efficiency-critical applications. Recently, implicit CoT approaches have
emerged, which encode reasoning steps within LLM's hidden embeddings (termed
``implicit reasoning'') rather than explicit tokens. This approach accelerates
CoT by reducing the reasoning length and bypassing some LLM components.
However, existing implicit CoT methods face two significant challenges: (1)
they fail to preserve the semantic alignment between the implicit reasoning
(when transformed to natural language) and the ground-truth reasoning,
resulting in a significant CoT performance degradation, and (2) they focus on
reducing the length of the implicit reasoning; however, they neglect the
considerable time cost for an LLM to generate one individual implicit reasoning
token. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel semantically-aligned
implicit CoT framework termed SemCoT. In particular, for the first challenge,
we design a contrastively trained sentence transformer that evaluates semantic
alignment between implicit and explicit reasoning, which is used to enforce
semantic preservation during implicit reasoning optimization. To address the
second challenge, we introduce an efficient implicit reasoning generator by
finetuning a lightweight language model using knowledge distillation. This
generator is guided by our sentence transformer to distill ground-truth
reasoning into semantically aligned implicit reasoning, while also optimizing
for accuracy. SemCoT is the first approach that enhances CoT efficiency by
jointly optimizing token-level generation speed and preserving semantic
alignment with ground-truth reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of SemCoT compared to state-of-the-art methods in both
efficiency and effectiveness. Our code can be found at

dataset (OpenWebText vs. The Pile), and scale (14 million parameters to 12
billion parameters), autoregressive language models exhibit highly consistent
patterns of change in their behavior over the course of pretraining. Based on
our analysis of over 1,400 language model checkpoints on over 110,000 tokens of
English, we find that up to 98% of the variance in language model behavior at
the word level can be explained by three simple heuristics: the unigram
probability (frequency) of a given word, the $n$-gram probability of the word,
and the semantic similarity between the word and its context. Furthermore, we
see consistent behavioral phases in all language models, with their predicted
probabilities for words overfitting to those words' $n$-gram probabilities for
increasing $n$ over the course of training. Taken together, these results
suggest that learning in neural language models may follow a similar trajectory
irrespective of model details.

*Chin-Jou Li,Kalvin Chang,Shikhar Bharadwaj,Eunjung Yeo,Kwanghee Choi,Jian Zhu,David Mortensen,Shinji Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: POWSM是一个统一的语音框架，能够同时执行多种音素相关任务，包括语音识别、音素识别、字素到音素转换和音素到字素转换，在保持性能的同时实现了任务统一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语音处理任务在概念上相似，但现有研究通常孤立处理每个任务，使用特定架构和数据集。作者希望开发一个统一框架来联合处理多个音素相关任务。

Method: 提出了POWSM（Phonetic Open Whisper-style Speech Model）统一框架，能够在音频、文本（字素）和音素之间进行无缝转换，支持多任务联合学习。

Result: POWSM在相似规模下优于或匹配专门的音素识别模型（Wav2Vec2Phoneme和ZIPA），同时联合支持G2P、P2G和ASR任务。

Conclusion: POWSM为通用和低资源语音处理开辟了新可能性，作者发布了训练数据、代码和模型以促进开放科学。

Abstract: Recent advances in spoken language processing have led to substantial
progress in phonetic tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), phone
recognition (PR), grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (G2P), and phoneme-to-grapheme
conversion (P2G). Despite their conceptual similarity, these tasks have largely
been studied in isolation, each relying on task-specific architectures and
datasets. In this paper, we introduce POWSM (Phonetic Open Whisper-style Speech
Model), the first unified framework capable of jointly performing multiple
phone-related tasks. POWSM enables seamless conversion between audio, text
(graphemes), and phones, opening up new possibilities for universal and
low-resource speech processing. Our model outperforms or matches specialized PR
models of similar size (Wav2Vec2Phoneme and ZIPA) while jointly supporting G2P,
P2G, and ASR. Our training data, code and models are released to foster open
science.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究预训练模型的复杂性掩盖了特定推理任务所需的最小机制，希望通过训练小型模型来理解transformer推理的计算基础。

Method: 训练小型注意力变换器在符号化间接宾语识别任务上，使用残差流分解、谱分析和嵌入干预来分析模型机制。

Result: 单层两注意力头模型在IOI任务上达到完美准确率，两个头专门化为加性和对比性子电路共同实现IOI解析。

Conclusion: 任务特定训练可产生高度可解释的最小电路，为研究transformer推理的计算基础提供了受控测试平台。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer large language models
(LLMs) into human-understandable computational circuits. However, the
complexity of pretrained models often obscures the minimal mechanisms required
for specific reasoning tasks. In this work, we train small, attention-only
transformers from scratch on a symbolic version of the Indirect Object
Identification (IOI) task -- a benchmark for studying coreference -- like
reasoning in transformers. Surprisingly, a single-layer model with only two
attention heads achieves perfect IOI accuracy, despite lacking MLPs and
normalization layers. Through residual stream decomposition, spectral analysis,
and embedding interventions, we find that the two heads specialize into
additive and contrastive subcircuits that jointly implement IOI resolution.
Furthermore, we show that a two-layer, one-head model achieves similar
performance by composing information across layers through query-value
interactions. These results demonstrate that task-specific training induces
highly interpretable, minimal circuits, offering a controlled testbed for
probing the computational foundations of transformer reasoning.

TL;DR: 评估四个口语语言模型在语音情感识别任务上的表现，发现这些模型主要依赖文本语义而非语音情感特征，表明文本相关表征在内部表示中占据主导地位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管口语语言模型在音频理解方面取得了进展，但对其泛化能力以及是否真正整合音频和文本模态存在疑问。本研究通过情感不一致的语音样本来检验模型的模态整合程度。

Method: 使用情感不一致的语音数据集（EMIS），在这种条件下，语音内容传达一种情感而语音表达传达另一种情感，评估四个口语语言模型在语音情感识别任务上的表现。

Result: 结果表明口语语言模型主要依赖文本语义而非语音情感来完成任务，文本相关表征在内部表示中占据主导地位。

Conclusion: 当前的口语语言模型在整合音频和文本模态方面存在不足，文本表征过度主导了模型的决策过程，需要改进模型以更好地利用语音情感特征。

Abstract: Advancements in spoken language processing have driven the development of
spoken language models (SLMs), designed to achieve universal audio
understanding by jointly learning text and audio representations for a wide
range of tasks. Although promising results have been achieved, there is growing
discussion regarding these models' generalization capabilities and the extent
to which they truly integrate audio and text modalities in their internal
representations. In this work, we evaluate four SLMs on the task of speech
emotion recognition using a dataset of emotionally incongruent speech samples,
a condition under which the semantic content of the spoken utterance conveys
one emotion while speech expressiveness conveys another. Our results indicate
that SLMs rely predominantly on textual semantics rather than speech emotion to
perform the task, indicating that text-related representations largely dominate
over acoustic representations. We release both the code and the Emotionally
Incongruent Synthetic Speech dataset (EMIS) to the community.

TL;DR: 该研究探索大型语言模型在生物医学文献中识别研究知识空白的能力，包括显性空白和隐性空白，并提出了TABI推理方案来结构化推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学进步依赖于明确阐述未知领域，本研究旨在评估LLMs识别生物医学文献中知识空白的能力，特别是扩展了隐性空白推断这一新任务。

Method: 在四个数据集上对近1500份文档进行实验，比较闭源和开源模型在段落级和全文级设置下的表现，并引入TABI推理方案来结构化隐性空白的推理过程。

Result: 结果显示LLMs在识别显性和隐性知识空白方面表现出强大能力，闭源和开源模型都表现良好，较大模型通常表现更优。

Conclusion: LLMs具有系统性识别候选知识空白的强大能力，可支持早期研究制定、政策制定和资助决策，同时指出了领域适应、人机验证等稳健部署方向。

Abstract: Scientific progress is driven by the deliberate articulation of what remains
unknown. This study investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
identify research knowledge gaps in the biomedical literature. We define two
categories of knowledge gaps: explicit gaps, clear declarations of missing
knowledge; and implicit gaps, context-inferred missing knowledge. While prior
work has focused mainly on explicit gap detection, we extend this line of
research by addressing the novel task of inferring implicit gaps. We conducted
two experiments on almost 1500 documents across four datasets, including a
manually annotated corpus of biomedical articles. We benchmarked both
closed-weight models (from OpenAI) and open-weight models (Llama and Gemma 2)
under paragraph-level and full-paper settings. To address the reasoning of
implicit gaps inference, we introduce \textbf{\small TABI}, a Toulmin-Abductive
Bucketed Inference scheme that structures reasoning and buckets inferred
conclusion candidates for validation. Our results highlight the robust
capability of LLMs in identifying both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps.
This is true for both open- and closed-weight models, with larger variants
often performing better. This suggests a strong ability of LLMs for
systematically identifying candidate knowledge gaps, which can support
early-stage research formulation, policymakers, and funding decisions. We also
report observed failure modes and outline directions for robust deployment,
including domain adaptation, human-in-the-loop verification, and benchmarking
across open- and closed-weight models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大型语言模型能否评估阅读理解题目的认知复杂度，重点关注证据范围和转换水平两个维度，发现LLMs能够近似认知复杂度，但在元认知意识方面存在局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阅读理解题目的认知复杂度评估对预测题目难度很重要，但传统方法依赖人工标注，缺乏自动提取认知特征的工具。

Method: 通过让大型语言模型评估阅读理解题目的认知复杂度，重点关注证据范围和转换水平两个维度，并与人类标注结果进行比较。

Result: 实验结果显示LLMs能够近似认知复杂度，表明其具有先验难度分析的潜力。但LLMs的推理能力与元认知意识存在差距。

Conclusion: LLMs可以作为阅读理解题目认知复杂度评估的工具，但在理解自身推理过程方面仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Estimating the cognitive complexity of reading comprehension (RC) items is
crucial for assessing item difficulty before it is administered to learners.
Unlike syntactic and semantic features, such as passage length or semantic
similarity between options, cognitive features that arise during answer
reasoning are not readily extractable using existing NLP tools and have
traditionally relied on human annotation. In this study, we examine whether
large language models (LLMs) can estimate the cognitive complexity of RC items
by focusing on two dimensions-Evidence Scope and Transformation Level-that
indicate the degree of cognitive burden involved in reasoning about the answer.
Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMs can approximate the cognitive
complexity of items, indicating their potential as tools for prior difficulty
analysis. Further analysis reveals a gap between LLMs' reasoning ability and
their metacognitive awareness: even when they produce correct answers, they
sometimes fail to correctly identify the features underlying their own
reasoning process.

*Gabin Taibi,Lucia Gomez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TOPol是一个半无监督框架，用于在人类定义的情境界限下重建和解释多维叙事极性场，通过向量表示量化语义位移，支持情感和非情感极性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算方法将情感视为单维尺度，忽略了语言的多维结构，需要开发能捕捉多维语义极性的框架。

Method: 使用基于transformer的大语言模型嵌入文档，应用邻居调优的UMAP投影，通过Leiden分区进行主题分割，计算主题边界质心间的方向向量来构建极性场。

Result: 在两个语料库上的评估显示，TOPol能一致捕捉情感和非情感极性转变，结果仅受情境界限定义影响，确认了方法稳定性。

Conclusion: TOPol提供了一个可扩展、可泛化和可解释的框架，用于上下文敏感的多维话语分析。

Abstract: Traditional approaches to semantic polarity in computational linguistics
treat sentiment as a unidimensional scale, overlooking the multidimensional
structure of language. This work introduces TOPol (Topic-Orientation POLarity),
a semi-unsupervised framework for reconstructing and interpreting
multidimensional narrative polarity fields under human-on-the-loop (HoTL)
defined contextual boundaries (CBs). The framework embeds documents using a
transformer-based large language model (tLLM), applies neighbor-tuned UMAP
projection, and segments topics via Leiden partitioning. Given a CB between
discourse regimes A and B, TOPol computes directional vectors between
corresponding topic-boundary centroids, yielding a polarity field that
quantifies fine-grained semantic displacement during regime shifts. This
vectorial representation enables assessing CB quality and detecting polarity
changes, guiding HoTL CB refinement. To interpret identified polarity vectors,
the tLLM compares their extreme points and produces contrastive labels with
estimated coverage. Robustness analyses show that only CB definitions (the main
HoTL-tunable parameter) significantly affect results, confirming methodological
stability. We evaluate TOPol on two corpora: (i) U.S. Central Bank speeches
around a macroeconomic breakpoint, capturing non-affective semantic shifts, and
(ii) Amazon product reviews across rating strata, where affective polarity
aligns with NRC valence. Results demonstrate that TOPol consistently captures
both affective and non-affective polarity transitions, providing a scalable,
generalizable, and interpretable framework for context-sensitive
multidimensional discourse analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学文本中的共指消解面临领域特定术语复杂、指称形式歧义高、长距离依赖等独特挑战，需要评估生成式LLM在该领域的适用性。

Method: 使用CRAFT语料库作为基准，设计了四种不同的提示实验（包含局部上下文、领域特定线索如缩写和实体词典），并与判别式SpanBERT模型进行对比。

Result: LLMs展现出强大的表层共指能力，特别是在使用领域基础提示时，但性能仍对长距离上下文和指称歧义敏感。LLaMA 8B和17B模型在实体增强提示下获得了优越的精确率和F1分数。

Conclusion: 轻量级提示工程能够有效增强LLM在生物医学NLP任务中的实用性，生成式方法在适当提示下可与判别式方法相媲美。

Abstract: Coreference resolution in biomedical texts presents unique challenges due to
complex domain-specific terminology, high ambiguity in mention forms, and
long-distance dependencies between coreferring expressions. In this work, we
present a comprehensive evaluation of generative large language models (LLMs)
for coreference resolution in the biomedical domain. Using the CRAFT corpus as
our benchmark, we assess the LLMs' performance with four prompting experiments
that vary in their use of local, contextual enrichment, and domain-specific
cues such as abbreviations and entity dictionaries. We benchmark these
approaches against a discriminative span-based encoder, SpanBERT, to compare
the efficacy of generative versus discriminative methods. Our results
demonstrate that while LLMs exhibit strong surface-level coreference
capabilities, especially when supplemented with domain-grounding prompts, their
performance remains sensitive to long-range context and mentions ambiguity.
Notably, the LLaMA 8B and 17B models show superior precision and F1 scores
under entity-augmented prompting, highlighting the potential of lightweight
prompt engineering for enhancing LLM utility in biomedical NLP tasks.

TL;DR: DEBATE是首个大规模实证基准，专门评估多智能体角色扮演LLM交互的真实性，包含29,417条来自2,792名美国参与者的多轮辩论对话，涵盖107个争议话题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确模拟社交互动中的观点变化对解决错误信息和极化问题至关重要。现有LLM角色扮演设置常产生不自然的群体动态（如过早收敛），缺乏衡量真实人类观点轨迹的实证基准。

Method: 引入DEBATE基准，包含大规模人类辩论对话数据，系统评估模拟与真实群体动态的差异，并通过监督微调使LLM与人类行为对齐。

Result: 使用DEBATE进行监督微调在表层指标（如ROUGE-L和消息长度）上取得改进，但在更深层语义对齐（如语义相似性）方面仍存在局限。

Conclusion: 研究突显了角色扮演LLM智能体在真实模拟人类社交动态方面的潜力和当前局限性。

Abstract: Accurately modeling opinion change through social interactions is crucial for
addressing issues like misinformation and polarization. While role-playing
large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human-like
interactions, existing research shows that single-agent alignment does not
guarantee authentic multi-agent group dynamics. Current LLM role-play setups
often produce unnatural dynamics (e.g., premature convergence), without an
empirical benchmark to measure authentic human opinion trajectories. To bridge
this gap, we introduce DEBATE, the first large-scale empirical benchmark
explicitly designed to evaluate the authenticity of the interaction between
multi-agent role-playing LLMs. DEBATE contains 29,417 messages from multi-round
debate conversations among over 2,792 U.S.-based participants discussing 107
controversial topics, capturing both publicly-expressed messages and
privately-reported opinions. Using DEBATE, we systematically evaluate and
identify critical discrepancies between simulated and authentic group dynamics.
We further demonstrate DEBATE's utility for aligning LLMs with human behavior
through supervised fine-tuning, achieving improvements in surface-level metrics
(e.g., ROUGE-L and message length) while highlighting limitations in deeper
semantic alignment (e.g., semantic similarity). Our findings highlight both the
potential and current limitations of role-playing LLM agents for realistically
simulating human-like social dynamics.

Abstract: This research article examines the effectiveness of various pretraining
strategies for developing machine translation models tailored to low-resource
languages. Although this work considers several low-resource languages,
including Afrikaans, Swahili, and Zulu, the translation model is specifically
developed for Lingala, an under-resourced African language, building upon the
pretraining approach introduced by Reid and Artetxe (2021), originally designed
for high-resource languages. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, we
explore different pretraining methodologies, including the integration of
multiple languages and the use of both monolingual and parallel data during the
pretraining phase. Our findings indicate that pretraining on multiple languages
and leveraging both monolingual and parallel data significantly enhance
translation quality. This study offers valuable insights into effective
pretraining strategies for low-resource machine translation, helping to bridge
the performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages. The
results contribute to the broader goal of developing more inclusive and
accurate NLP models for marginalized communities and underrepresented
populations. The code and datasets used in this study are publicly available to
facilitate further research and ensure reproducibility, with the exception of
certain data that may no longer be accessible due to changes in public

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural
language processing, yet their training on massive corpora poses significant
risks, including the memorization of sensitive personal data, copyrighted
material, and knowledge that could facilitate malicious activities. To mitigate
these issues and align with legal and ethical standards such as the "right to
be forgotten", machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique to
selectively erase specific knowledge from LLMs without compromising their
overall performance. This survey provides a systematic review of over 180
papers on LLM unlearning published since 2021, focusing exclusively on
large-scale generative models. Distinct from prior surveys, we introduce novel
taxonomies for both unlearning methods and evaluations. We clearly categorize
methods into training-time, post-training, and inference-time based on the
training stage at which unlearning is applied. For evaluations, we not only
systematically compile existing datasets and metrics but also critically
analyze their advantages, disadvantages, and applicability, providing practical
guidance to the research community. In addition, we discuss key challenges and
promising future research directions. Our comprehensive overview aims to inform
and guide the ongoing development of secure and reliable LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散音频表示在语音建模中越来越受欢迎，但在嘈杂或真实环境中并不总是最优的。现有方法量化Whisper嵌入进行语音到单元建模，但需要更好地处理噪声问题。

Method: 在潜在空间中分离语义语音内容和背景噪声，端到端模型以码本token形式分离干净语音，同时通过轻量级分类器监督提取可解释的噪声向量作为量化残差。

Result: 在VBDemand测试集上，与Whisper相比错误率降低82%，比基线方法提升35%。学习的token空间在已见和未见声学条件下都表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了干净/嘈杂语音与文本之间的对齐度，产生具有高度噪声不变性的语音token，并改善了ASR性能，在多种声学条件下都具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Discrete audio representations are gaining traction in speech modeling due to
their interpretability and compatibility with large language models, but are
not always optimized for noisy or real-world environments. Building on existing
works that quantize Whisper embeddings for speech-to-unit modeling, we propose
disentangling semantic speech content from background noise in the latent
space. Our end-to-end model separates clean speech in the form of codebook
tokens, while extracting interpretable noise vectors as quantization residue
which are supervised via a lightweight classifier. We show that our approach
improves alignment between clean/noisy speech and text, producing speech tokens
that display a high degree of noiseinvariance, and improves ASR performance.
Keeping Whisper frozen, we show an 82% reduction in error rate compared to
Whisper, and 35% improvement over baseline methods on the VBDemand test set.
Further analyses show that the learned token space generalizes well to both
seen and unseen acoustic conditions.

*Hongjin Qian,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Model-Document Protocol (MDP)框架，将原始文档转换为LLM可消费的知识表示，包括智能推理、记忆基础和结构化利用三种路径。MDP-Agent实现了该协议，在信息检索基准测试中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索方法将文档作为原始文本处理，返回原始段落，将片段组装和上下文推理的负担留给LLM。需要一种新的检索范式来重新定义模型与文档的交互方式。

Method: MDP框架通过三种路径将非结构化文档转换为任务特定的LLM就绪输入：智能推理将原始证据整理为连贯上下文；记忆基础积累可重用笔记来丰富推理；结构化利用将文档编码为图形或键值缓存等正式表示。MDP-Agent实现了该协议，构建文档级要点记忆，执行基于扩散的探索与垂直利用，应用map-reduce风格合成整合大规模证据。

Result: 在信息检索基准测试中，MDP-Agent的表现优于基线方法，验证了MDP框架的合理性和其智能实例的有效性。

Conclusion: MDP框架重新定义了检索范式，确保LLM接收的不是原始片段而是紧凑、结构化的可直接用于推理的知识，为AI搜索提供了更有效的文档交互方式。

Abstract: AI search depends on linking large language models (LLMs) with vast external
knowledge sources. Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not
inherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional
retrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw
passages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to
the LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that
redefines how models interact with documents.
  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that
formalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge
representations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP
defines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into
task-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates
raw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates
reusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes
documents into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All
three pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not
raw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for
reasoning.
  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol
through an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for
global coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical
exploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style
synthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient
context. Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that
MDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the soundness of the MDP
framework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型在低资源语言上的表现，发现模型性能与语言资源丰富度直接相关，且思维链提示的效果因模型能力而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型的优异表现是源于真实能力还是英语数据优势，通过在低资源语言环境中测试来验证。

Method: 构建包含英语、斯瓦希里语和豪萨语的大规模基准测试，使用Next Sentence Prediction任务测试GPT-4 Turbo、Gemini 1.5 Flash和LLaMA 3 70B等模型，并引入思维链提示。

Result: 所有模型在英语上表现优异，但在斯瓦希里语上准确率下降，在豪萨语上大幅下降，LLaMA 3表现最差。思维链提示对LLaMA 3有帮助，但对GPT-4和Gemini反而造成"过度思考"而降低性能。

Conclusion: 思维链提示并非通用解决方案，其效果取决于模型的基础能力和具体任务背景，揭示了LLM在跨语言环境中的局限性。

Abstract: While large language models are trained on massive datasets, this data is
heavily skewed towards English. Does their impressive performance reflect
genuine ability or just this data advantage? To find out, we tested them in a
setting where they could not rely on data abundance: low-resource languages.
Building on prior work Agarwal et al. (2025) that used Next Sentence Prediction
(NSP) as a test, we created a large-scale benchmark with 10,000 questions each
for English (a high-resource language), Swahili (medium-resource), and Hausa
(low-resource). We then tested several top models, including GPT-4 Turbo,
Gemini 1.5 Flash, and LLaMA 3 70B, to see how their performance holds up. The
results painted a clear picture of how levels of language resources impact
outcomes. While all models excelled in English, their accuracy dropped in
Swahili and fell sharply in Hausa, with LLaMA 3 struggling the most. The story
became even more interesting when we introduced Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting. For the struggling LLaMA 3, CoT acted as a helpful guide,
significantly boosting its accuracy. However, for the more capable GPT-4 and
Gemini, the same technique often backfired, leading to a kind of "overthinking"
that hurt their results in the cross-lingual context. This reveals that
Chain-of-Thought is not a universal solution; its effectiveness depends heavily
on the model's baseline capability and the specific context of the task. Our
framework pinpoints LLM weaknesses, highlights when CoT helps or hinders

*Ziyi Liu,Bahar Sarrafzadeh,Pei Zhou,Longqi Yang,Jieyu Zhao,Ashish Sharma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProMediate是首个评估复杂多议题多方谈判中主动AI调解代理的框架，包含基于现实谈判案例的模拟测试平台和基于社会认知理论的评估指标，能系统评估主动AI代理的社会认知智能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏评估主动AI代理在多方面协作中表现的系统方法，特别是在需要处理多方冲突利益和建立共识的谈判场景中，限制了支持多人协作的AI发展。

Method: 构建ProMediate框架，包括基于现实谈判案例和难度分级的模拟测试平台（易、中、难三级），以及基于社会认知理论的评估指标，测量共识变化、干预延迟、调解效果和智能水平。

Result: 在社会智能调解代理与通用基线的比较中，社会智能调解代理在ProMediate-Hard场景下将共识变化提高了3.6个百分点（10.65% vs 7.01%），响应速度提高了77%（3.71s vs 15.98s）。

Conclusion: ProMediate为开发主动、社会智能的代理提供了一个严谨、理论基础的测试平台，推动了在多方面协作中AI代理的发展。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in agentic
frameworks to assist individual users, there is a growing need for agents that
can proactively manage complex, multi-party collaboration. Systematic
evaluation methods for such proactive agents remain scarce, limiting progress
in developing AI that can effectively support multiple people together.
Negotiation offers a demanding testbed for this challenge, requiring
socio-cognitive intelligence to navigate conflicting interests between multiple
participants and multiple topics and build consensus. Here, we present
ProMediate, the first framework for evaluating proactive AI mediator agents in
complex, multi-topic, multi-party negotiations. ProMediate consists of two core
components: (i) a simulation testbed based on realistic negotiation cases and
theory-driven difficulty levels (ProMediate-Easy, ProMediate-Medium, and
ProMediate-Hard), with a plug-and-play proactive AI mediator grounded in
socio-cognitive mediation theories, capable of flexibly deciding when and how
to intervene; and (ii) a socio-cognitive evaluation framework with a new suite
of metrics to measure consensus changes, intervention latency, mediator
effectiveness, and intelligence. Together, these components establish a
systematic framework for assessing the socio-cognitive intelligence of
proactive AI agents in multi-party settings. Our results show that a socially
intelligent mediator agent outperforms a generic baseline, via faster,
better-targeted interventions. In the ProMediate-Hard setting, our social
mediator increases consensus change by 3.6 percentage points compared to the
generic baseline (10.65\% vs 7.01\%) while being 77\% faster in response
(15.98s vs. 3.71s). In conclusion, ProMediate provides a rigorous,
theory-grounded testbed to advance the development of proactive, socially
intelligent agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言中特定领域问答面临的两个关键挑战：标注数据稀缺和通用语言模型领域知识有限。

Method: 使用大型LLM（LLaMA-70B、Phi-14B）生成合成问答对来扩充有限原始数据集，探索多种训练方法并分析其对领域泛化的影响。

Result: 大型模型能高效生成合成数据，小型模型能有效适应这些数据，为低资源特定领域问答提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Conclusion: 多阶段微调策略结合合成数据增强，为低资源语言特定领域问答任务提供了可行的技术路径。

Abstract: Domain-specific question answering in low-resource languages faces two key
challenges: scarcity of annotated datasets and limited domain knowledge in
general-purpose language models. In this work, we present a multi-stage
finetuning strategy to adapt lightweight language models to the Hindi tourism
domain by leveraging both original and synthetic training data. Synthetic
question-answer pairs are generated using large LLMs (LLaMA-70B, Phi-14B) and
used to augment the limited original dataset. We explore several training
methodologies and analyse their impact on domain generalisation. Our results
demonstrate that large models can efficiently generate synthetic data, while
small models can effectively adapt to it, offering a scalable pathway for
low-resource, domain-specific QA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PEKD是一个统一的参数高效微调框架，通过从在大规模讽刺数据上训练的专家模型进行蒸馏，结合熵感知门控机制动态调整蒸馏强度，在少样本多模态讽刺检测任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态讽刺检测在低资源环境下具有挑战性，因为图像-文本间的微妙矛盾难以从稀缺的标注数据中学习。现有的参数高效微调方法虽然能减少过拟合，但在少样本场景下由于监督信号有限而难以达到最优性能。

Method: 提出PEKD框架，通过从在大规模讽刺数据上训练的专家模型（教师模型）进行蒸馏来增强参数高效微调方法。引入熵感知门控机制，根据教师模型的置信度动态调整蒸馏强度，以缓解不可靠信号的影响。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上的实验表明，PEKD框架使参数高效微调方法在少样本场景下优于先前的参数高效方法和大型多模态模型，取得了强劲的结果。

Conclusion: PEKD是一个模块化且适应性强的框架，可广泛应用于各种多模态模型和任务，有效解决了少样本多模态讽刺检测中的性能瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection is challenging, especially in low-resource
settings where subtle image-text contradictions are hard to learn due to scarce
annotated data, which hinders the model's performance. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like adapters, LoRA, and prompt tuning reduce
overfitting but struggle to reach optimal performance due to limited
supervision from few-shot data. We propose PEKD, a unified framework that
enhances PEFT methods via distillation from an expert model trained on
large-scale sarcasm data, which acts as the teacher. To mitigate unreliable
signals from the teacher, we introduce an entropy-aware gating mechanism that
dynamically adjusts the distillation strength based on teacher confidence.
Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our PEKD framework enables
PEFT methods to outperform both prior parameter-efficient approaches and large
multimodal models, achieving strong results in the few-shot scenario. The
framework is modular and adaptable to a wide range of multimodal models and
tasks.

TL;DR: 提出Parrot训练框架，通过分析N-CoT和P-CoT两种范式的错误类型，设计三个子任务实现双向增强，显著提升数学推理性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常单向增强N-CoT或P-CoT，本文旨在充分发挥两种范式的优势实现相互增强和同步改进

Method: 1) 设计三个目标导向的子任务整合顺序P-CoT和N-CoT生成；2) 采用子任务混合训练策略促进自然语言语义可迁移性；3) 设计转换的N-CoT辅助奖励缓解P-CoT优化中的稀疏奖励问题

Result: 实验表明Parrot显著提升N-CoT和P-CoT性能，特别是在N-CoT上。使用Parrot SFT，LLaMA2和CodeLLaMA在MathQA上的N-CoT性能分别提升+21.87和+21.48

Conclusion: Parrot框架成功实现N-CoT和P-CoT的双向增强，在数学推理任务上取得显著性能提升

Abstract: Natural language chain-of-thought (N-CoT) and Program chain-of-thought
(P-CoT) have emerged as two primary paradigms for large language models (LLMs)
to solve mathematical reasoning problems. Current research typically endeavors
to achieve unidirectional enhancement: P-CoT enhanced N-CoT or N-CoT enhanced
P-CoT. In this paper, we seek to fully unleash the two paradigms' strengths for
mutual enhancement and ultimately achieve simultaneous improvements. We conduct
a detailed analysis of the error types across two paradigms, based on which we
propose Parrot, a novel training pipeline for mathematical problems: 1) Three
target-designed subtasks integrate sequential P-CoT and N-CoT generation. 2) A
subtask hybrid training strategy to facilitate natural language semantic
transferability. 3) The converted N-CoT auxiliary reward is designed to
alleviate the sparse rewards in P-CoT optimization. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Parrot significantly enhances both the performance of N-CoT
and P-CoT, especially on N-CoT. Using Parrot SFT, the N-CoT performance of
LLaMA2 and CodeLLaMA achieve gains of +21.87 and +21.48 on MathQA over the RL
baseline, which is resource-intensive.

Result: 在CRMArena-Pro数据集上验证，轻量级模型在B2B和B2C商业场景中取得有竞争力的结果

Conclusion: CRMWeaver方法有效提升了业务代理在复杂商业环境中的表现和泛化能力，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of LLM-based agents, which
shed light on using language agents to solve complex real-world problems. A
prominent application lies in business agents, which interact with databases
and internal knowledge bases via tool calls to fulfill diverse user
requirements. However, this domain is characterized by intricate data
relationships and a wide range of heterogeneous tasks, from statistical data
queries to knowledge-based question-answering. To address these challenges, we
propose CRMWeaver, a novel approach that enhances business agents in such
complex settings. To acclimate the agentic model to intricate business
environments, we employ a synthesis data generation and RL-based paradigm
during training, which significantly improves the model's ability to handle
complex data and varied tasks. During inference, a shared memories mechanism is
introduced, prompting the agent to learn from task guidelines in similar
problems, thereby further boosting its effectiveness and generalization,
especially in unseen scenarios. We validate the efficacy of our approach on the
CRMArena-Pro dataset, where our lightweight model achieves competitive results
in both B2B and B2C business scenarios, underscoring its practical value for
real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过实证研究反对在法律解释中使用大语言模型，发现模型无法提供稳定的法律解释判断，且与人类判断相关性较弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对近期法律学者和联邦法官在实践中使用大语言模型进行法律解释的趋势，本文旨在通过实证研究评估这种做法的可靠性。

Method: 使用英语进行实证调查，通过改变问题格式来测试模型的法律解释稳定性，并比较模型判断与人类判断的相关性。

Result: 研究发现模型无法提供稳定的法律解释判断，改变问题格式会导致模型得出截然不同的结论；模型与人类判断的相关性从弱到中等不等，且在不同模型和问题变体间存在较大差异。

Conclusion: 生成式AI得出的结论可信度较低，在法律解释中过度依赖这些模型是危险的。

Abstract: Legal interpretation frequently involves assessing how a legal text, as
understood by an 'ordinary' speaker of the language, applies to the set of
facts characterizing a legal dispute in the U.S. judicial system. Recent
scholarship has proposed that legal practitioners add large language models
(LLMs) to their interpretive toolkit. This work offers an empirical argument
against LLM interpretation as recently practiced by legal scholars and federal
judges. Our investigation in English shows that models do not provide stable
interpretive judgments: varying the question format can lead the model to
wildly different conclusions. Moreover, the models show weak to moderate
correlation with human judgment, with large variance across model and question
variant, suggesting that it is dangerous to give much credence to the
conclusions produced by generative AI.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨小规模语言模型是否能从指令调优中受益，比较了对话和问答指令调优数据集在合并或顺序课程中的效果，发现指令调优在微调场景中有小幅但一致的提升，但改进并不总是能迁移到零样本任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究小规模语言模型（100M和140M参数）是否能够通过指令调优获得性能提升，探索人类启发式学习策略在低资源模型中的适用性。

Method: 使用解码器专用模型，比较对话和问答指令调优数据集，采用合并或顺序课程两种策略，在微调（SuperGLUE）和零样本（BLiMP、EWoK、WUGs等）设置下进行评估。

Result: 指令调优在微调场景中带来小幅但一致的性能提升，顺序课程优于合并数据；但改进并不总是能迁移到零样本任务，表明存在交互适应与广泛语言泛化之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 研究结果凸显了将人类启发式学习策略应用于低资源语言模型的潜力和限制，并指向基于课程的混合方法来在生态训练限制下增强泛化能力。

Abstract: This work investigates whether small-scale LMs can benefit from instruction
tuning. We compare conversational and question-answering instruction tuning
datasets, applied either in a merged or sequential curriculum, using
decoder-only models with 100M and 140M parameters. Evaluation spans both
fine-tuning (SuperGLUE) and zero-shot (BLiMP, EWoK, WUGs, entity tracking, and
psycholinguistic correlation) settings. Results show that instruction tuning
yields small but consistent gains in fine-tuning scenarios, with sequential
curricula outperforming merged data; however, improvements do not consistently
transfer to zero-shot tasks, suggesting a trade-off between interaction-focused
adaptation and broad linguistic generalization. These results highlight both
the potential and the constraints of adapting human-inspired learning
strategies to low-resource LMs, and point toward hybrid, curriculum-based
approaches for enhancing generalization under ecological training limits.

Motivation: 传统专家方法难以跟上快速演进的ICT领域创新周期和模糊的早期术语，需要新的技术预测方法。

Method: 利用LLM从非结构化文本中提取语义三元组构建技术实体关系图，开发了名词钉合技术术语分组方法和基于图的融合信号检测指标，包括多阶段过滤、领域特定关键词聚类和主题共现时序分析。

Result: 在278,625篇arXiv预印本和9,793项USPTO专利申请上验证，能够识别已建立和新兴的融合模式。

Abstract: Forecasting transformative technologies remains a critical but challenging
task, particularly in fast-evolving domains such as Information and
Communication Technologies (ICTs). Traditional expert-based methods struggle to
keep pace with short innovation cycles and ambiguous early-stage terminology.
In this work, we propose a novel, data-driven pipeline to monitor the emergence
of transformative technologies by identifying patterns of technological
convergence.
  Our approach leverages advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract
semantic triples from unstructured text and construct a large-scale graph of
technology-related entities and relations. We introduce a new method for
grouping semantically similar technology terms (noun stapling) and develop
graph-based metrics to detect convergence signals. The pipeline includes
multi-stage filtering, domain-specific keyword clustering, and a temporal trend
analysis of topic co-occurence.
  We validate our methodology on two complementary datasets: 278,625 arXiv
preprints (2017--2024) to capture early scientific signals, and 9,793 USPTO
patent applications (2018-2024) to track downstream commercial developments.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline can identify both
established and emerging convergence patterns, offering a scalable and
generalizable framework for technology forecasting grounded in full-text
analysis.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs生成参考文献时，高引用论文的幻觉率更低，引用次数超过约1000次时，文献信息几乎被逐字记忆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在文献推荐中产生虚假文献的问题，探究引用频率如何影响LLM输出中的幻觉参考文献。

Method: 使用GPT-4生成100个计算机科学领域的文献记录，通过余弦相似度测量生成与真实元数据的事实一致性。

Result: 幻觉率因研究领域而异；引用次数与事实准确性强相关；超过约1000次引用时，文献信息几乎被逐字记忆。

Conclusion: 高引用论文在模型中被近乎逐字保留，表明存在从泛化转向记忆的阈值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range
of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they
have also been used to assist in bibliographic recommendation, the
hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior
studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce
bibliographic information depends on whether the underlying knowledge is
generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear
in the training corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume
citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency
with which a given bibliographic record is repeatedly represented in the
pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated
references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified
100 bibliographic records across twenty computer-science domains, and measured
factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic
metadata. The results revealed that (i) hallucination rates vary across
research domains, (ii) citation count is strongly correlated with factual
accuracy, and (iii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatimly
memorized beyond approximately 1,000 citations. These findings suggest that
highly cited papers are nearly verbatimly retained in the model, indicating a
threshold where generalization shifts into memorization.

Motivation: 心理健康AI开发面临真实治疗对话数据稀缺的挑战，主要原因是严格的隐私法规和历史上很少记录临床会话。需要一种既能保护隐私又能生成高质量对话数据的方法。

Method: 开发了SQPsych框架，基于认知行为治疗原则，将结构化心理输入通过治疗师-客户模拟转换为自然语言对话。使用开源权重的LLM生成高质量语料库，并通过专家评估和LLM评估进行验证。

Result: 在SQPsychConv上微调的SQPsychLLM模型在心理咨询基准测试中表现优异，在关键治疗技能上超越了基线模型。生成了经过验证的高质量合成对话语料库。

Conclusion: 合成数据具有实现可扩展、数据安全且临床知情的心理健康AI支持的潜力。该方法为心理健康AI开发提供了可行的数据解决方案。

Abstract: The development of AI for mental health is hindered by a lack of authentic
therapy dialogues, due to strict privacy regulations and the fact that clinical
sessions were historically rarely recorded. We present an LLM-driven pipeline
that generates synthetic counseling dialogues based on structured client
profiles and psychological questionnaires. Grounded on the principles of
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), our method creates synthetic therapeutic
conversations for clinical disorders such as anxiety and depression. Our
framework, SQPsych (Structured Questionnaire-based Psychotherapy), converts
structured psychological input into natural language dialogues through
therapist-client simulations. Due to data governance policies and privacy
restrictions prohibiting the transmission of clinical questionnaire data to
third-party services, previous methodologies relying on proprietary models are
infeasible in our setting. We address this limitation by generating a
high-quality corpus using open-weight LLMs, validated through human expert
evaluation and LLM-based assessments. Our SQPsychLLM models fine-tuned on
SQPsychConv achieve strong performance on counseling benchmarks, surpassing
baselines in key therapeutic skills. Our findings highlight the potential of
synthetic data to enable scalable, data-secure, and clinically informed AI for
mental health support. We will release our code, models, and corpus at

TL;DR: BhashaBench V1是首个针对印度知识系统的领域特定、多任务、双语基准测试，包含74,166个精心策划的问答对，涵盖农业、法律、金融和阿育吠陀四大领域，用于评估LLM在印度语境下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要面向英语世界且缺乏领域特异性，无法有效评估LLM在印度文化和领域特定知识中的表现，因此需要开发专门针对印度语境的评估基准。

Method: 构建包含74,166个问答对的双语数据集（52,494英文，21,672印地语），数据源自真实的政府和领域特定考试，涵盖4大领域、90+子领域和500+主题，对29+个LLM进行评估。

Result: 评估显示LLM在不同领域和语言间存在显著性能差距，GPT-4o在法律领域准确率达76.49%，但在阿育吠陀领域仅59.74%；所有模型在英文内容上的表现均优于印地语；网络法、国际金融等子领域表现较好，而Panchakarma、种子科学和人权等领域表现较弱。

Conclusion: BhashaBench V1为评估LLM在印度多样化知识领域的能力提供了全面数据集，支持评估模型整合领域特定知识与双语理解的能力，所有资源公开可用以支持开放研究。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models(LLMs) has intensified the need
for domain and culture specific evaluation. Existing benchmarks are largely
Anglocentric and domain-agnostic, limiting their applicability to India-centric
contexts. To address this gap, we introduce BhashaBench V1, the first
domain-specific, multi-task, bilingual benchmark focusing on critical Indic
knowledge systems. BhashaBench V1 contains 74,166 meticulously curated
question-answer pairs, with 52,494 in English and 21,672 in Hindi, sourced from
authentic government and domain-specific exams. It spans four major domains:
Agriculture, Legal, Finance, and Ayurveda, comprising 90+ subdomains and
covering 500+ topics, enabling fine-grained evaluation. Evaluation of 29+ LLMs
reveals significant domain and language specific performance gaps, with
especially large disparities in low-resource domains. For instance, GPT-4o
achieves 76.49% overall accuracy in Legal but only 59.74% in Ayurveda. Models
consistently perform better on English content compared to Hindi across all
domains. Subdomain-level analysis shows that areas such as Cyber Law,
International Finance perform relatively well, while Panchakarma, Seed Science,
and Human Rights remain notably weak. BhashaBench V1 provides a comprehensive
dataset for evaluating large language models across India's diverse knowledge
domains. It enables assessment of models' ability to integrate domain-specific
knowledge with bilingual understanding. All code, benchmarks, and resources are
publicly available to support open research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM服务系统主要为文本补全设计，无法有效处理日益复杂的LLM应用需求，缺乏灵活性和效率。

Method: 设计Symphony系统作为LIPs的操作系统，通过系统调用暴露LLM计算，虚拟化KV缓存为文件系统，采用两级进程调度确保GPU效率。

Result: Symphony能够支持用户自定义token预测和KV缓存管理，将应用逻辑(如工具执行)卸载到服务器端。

Conclusion: Symphony架构为LLM应用开辟了更高效和可扩展的生态系统。

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) serving systems, primarily designed for
text completion, are neither efficient nor adaptable for increasingly complex
LLM applications due to their inflexible design. We propose a new LLM serving
system architecture that serves programs instead of prompts to address this
problem. These programs, called LLM Inference Programs (LIPs), allow users to
customize token prediction and KV cache management at runtime and to offload
parts of their application logic, such as tool execution, to the server. We
describe an example of this architecture through a system named Symphony, which
functions as an operating system for LIPs. Symphony exposes LLM model
computations via system calls and virtualizes KV cache with a dedicated file
system, while ensuring GPU efficiency with a two-level process scheduling
scheme. Symphony has the potential to open the door to a more efficient and
extensible ecosystem for LLM applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手语翻译数据集规模有限、缺乏多语言覆盖且标注成本高，而视觉语言模型在手语数据采集方面的潜力尚未被开发。

Method: 基于VLM的流水线包括人脸可见性检测、手语活动识别、视频文本提取以及视频-文本对齐验证，实施通用的过滤、标注和验证步骤。

Result: 构建了TikTok-SL-8数据集，在两个现成的手语翻译模型上评估了德国和美国手语的性能，建立了自动提取数据的基线。

Conclusion: 该工作实现了手语翻译的可扩展弱监督预训练，促进了从社交媒体获取手语数据的能力。

Abstract: Most existing sign language translation (SLT) datasets are limited in scale,
lack multilingual coverage, and are costly to curate due to their reliance on
expert annotation and controlled recording setup. Recently, Vision Language
Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities as evaluators and real-time
assistants. Despite these advancements, their potential remains untapped in the
context of sign language dataset acquisition. To bridge this gap, we introduce
the first automated annotation and filtering framework that utilizes VLMs to
reduce reliance on manual effort while preserving data quality. Our method is
applied to TikTok videos across eight sign languages and to the already curated
YouTube-SL-25 dataset in German Sign Language for the purpose of additional
evaluation. Our VLM-based pipeline includes a face visibility detection, a sign
activity recognition, a text extraction from video content, and a judgment step
to validate alignment between video and text, implementing generic filtering,
annotation and validation steps. Using the resulting corpus, TikTok-SL-8, we
assess the performance of two off-the-shelf SLT models on our filtered dataset
for German and American Sign Languages, with the goal of establishing baselines
and evaluating the robustness of recent models on automatically extracted,
slightly noisy data. Our work enables scalable, weakly supervised pretraining
for SLT and facilitates data acquisition from social media.

Method: 研究评估了不同规模LLMs从上下文驱动提示中推断用户意图的能力，并检验理解隐含意义是否能改善响应生成。

Result: 更大模型更接近人类理解，小模型在隐含意义推断上表现较差；基于隐含意义的提示显著提升了响应的相关性和质量，67.6%参与者更偏好这种响应。

Conclusion: 语言学理论可用于解决对齐问题，使人类-AI交互更加自然和基于上下文。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) is positioning language
at the core of human-computer interaction (HCI). We argue that advancing HCI
requires attention to the linguistic foundations of interaction, particularly
implicature (meaning conveyed beyond explicit statements through shared
context) which is essential for human-AI (HAI) alignment. This study examines
LLMs' ability to infer user intent embedded in context-driven prompts and
whether understanding implicature improves response generation. Results show
that larger models approximate human interpretations more closely, while
smaller models struggle with implicature inference. Furthermore,
implicature-based prompts significantly enhance the perceived relevance and
quality of responses across models, with notable gains in smaller models.
Overall, 67.6% of participants preferred responses with implicature-embedded
prompts to literal ones, highlighting a clear preference for contextually
nuanced communication. Our work contributes to understanding how linguistic
theory can be used to address the alignment problem by making HAI interaction
more natural and contextually grounded.

*Auguste Poiroux,Antoine Bosselut,Viktor Kunčak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLMEval是一个针对神经定理证明和证明自动形式化的评估套件，基于真实世界的Lean形式化项目，包含613个定理，揭示了现有模型在真实研究级数学问题上的表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在精选基准测试中表现优异，但在研究级神经定理证明和证明自动形式化方面的实际影响仍然有限，需要更真实的评估环境。

Method: 利用真实Lean Blueprint形式化项目创建RLMEval评估套件，包含613个来自6个Lean项目的定理，评估最先进模型在这些挑战性问题上的表现。

Result: 在RLMEval上的评估显示，现有基准测试的进展不能直接转化为这些更真实环境中的表现，最佳模型仅达到10.3%的通过率。

Conclusion: RLMEval提供了一个新的、具有挑战性的基准，旨在指导和加速形式数学中自动推理的进展。

Abstract: Despite impressive results on curated benchmarks, the practical impact of
large language models (LLMs) on research-level neural theorem proving and proof
autoformalization is still limited. We introduce RLMEval, an evaluation suite
for these tasks, focusing on research-level mathematics from real-world Lean
formalization projects. RLMEval targets the evaluation of neural theorem
proving and proof autoformalization on challenging research-level theorems by
leveraging real Lean Blueprint formalization projects. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art models on RLMEval, comprising 613 theorems from 6 Lean
projects, reveals a significant gap: progress on existing benchmarks does not
readily translate to these more realistic settings, with the best model
achieving only a 10.3 % pass rate. RLMEval provides a new, challenging
benchmark designed to guide and accelerate progress in automated reasoning for
formal mathematics.

### [124] [Depth and Autonomy: A Framework for Evaluating LLM Applications in Social Science Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25432)
*Ali Sanaei,Ali Rajabzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个框架来分类定性社会科学研究中的LLM应用，基于解释深度和自主性两个维度，建议通过任务分解和有限自主性来平衡LLM使用的效益与可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在定性社会科学研究中面临的解释偏见、低可靠性和弱可审计性等挑战，为研究者提供实用的设计建议。

Method: 基于Web of Science上所有使用LLM作为工具的已发表社会科学论文，构建了一个二维分类框架（解释深度和自主性），并提出任务分解策略。

Result: 开发了一个系统性的LLM应用分类方法，强调通过降低自主性和选择性增加解释深度来保持透明度和可靠性。

Conclusion: 通过有限自主性和监督下的任务分解，研究者可以在保持透明度和可靠性的同时，有效利用LLM的优势进行定性社会科学研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized by researchers across
a wide range of domains, and qualitative social science is no exception;
however, this adoption faces persistent challenges, including interpretive
bias, low reliability, and weak auditability. We introduce a framework that
situates LLM usage along two dimensions, interpretive depth and autonomy,
thereby offering a straightforward way to classify LLM applications in
qualitative research and to derive practical design recommendations. We present
the state of the literature with respect to these two dimensions, based on all
published social science papers available on Web of Science that use LLMs as a
tool and not strictly as the subject of study. Rather than granting models
expansive freedom, our approach encourages researchers to decompose tasks into
manageable segments, much as they would when delegating work to capable
undergraduate research assistants. By maintaining low levels of autonomy and
selectively increasing interpretive depth only where warranted and under
supervision, one can plausibly reap the benefits of LLMs while preserving
transparency and reliability.

TL;DR: 本文分析了基于文本的手语翻译评估指标的局限性，比较了BLEU、ROUGE等传统指标与LLM评估器在语义等价性、幻觉检测等方面的表现，指出需要多模态评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前手语翻译评估仅依赖文本指标，不清楚这些指标能否可靠评估SLT输出质量，需要系统分析文本指标的局限性。

Method: 分析六种评估指标（BLEU、chrF、ROUGE、BLEURT、G-Eval、GEMBA），在三种控制条件下评估：释义、模型输出幻觉、句子长度变化。

Result: 词汇重叠指标存在局限，LLM评估器能更好捕捉语义等价性但偏向LLM释义翻译；所有指标都能检测幻觉，BLEU过于敏感，BLEURT和LLM评估器对细微案例较宽容。

Conclusion: 需要超越文本指标的多模态评估框架，以实现对手语翻译输出的更全面评估。

Abstract: Automatic evaluation metrics are crucial for advancing sign language
translation (SLT). Current SLT evaluation metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE, are
only text-based, and it remains unclear to what extent text-based metrics can
reliably capture the quality of SLT outputs. To address this gap, we
investigate the limitations of text-based SLT evaluation metrics by analyzing
six metrics, including BLEU, chrF, and ROUGE, as well as BLEURT on the one
hand, and large language model (LLM)-based evaluators such as G-Eval and GEMBA
zero-shot direct assessment on the other hand. Specifically, we assess the
consistency and robustness of these metrics under three controlled conditions:
paraphrasing, hallucinations in model outputs, and variations in sentence
length. Our analysis highlights the limitations of lexical overlap metrics and
demonstrates that while LLM-based evaluators better capture semantic
equivalence often missed by conventional metrics, they can also exhibit bias
toward LLM-paraphrased translations. Moreover, although all metrics are able to
detect hallucinations, BLEU tends to be overly sensitive, whereas BLEURT and
LLM-based evaluators are comparatively lenient toward subtle cases. This
motivates the need for multimodal evaluation frameworks that extend beyond
text-based metrics to enable a more holistic assessment of SLT outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs主要作为被动响应者，但在高风险领域需要它们成为主动、目标导向的合作伙伴。现有方法要么短视优化单轮属性，要么依赖脆弱、高成本的用户模拟器，存在"现实差距"。

Method: 利用专家轨迹的观察未来推断密集的逐轮奖励信号，将长时程问题分解为监督学习任务，训练策略输出结构化的(行动，状态评估)元组，控制"问什么"和"何时停止"。通过自动评分器校准管道净化基于LLM的奖励模型噪声。

Result: 在真实医疗数据集上验证了Learn-to-Ask的有效性，使用高达32B参数的LLMs。在严格的内部评估中，部署的模型性能甚至优于人类专家，成功转化为现实世界影响。

Conclusion: 该工作为将被动LLMs转变为主动、目标导向的LLM应用提供了实用且经济可行的蓝图，能够将离线数据转化为切实的现实世界影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel as passive responders, but teaching them
to be proactive, goal-oriented partners, a critical capability in high-stakes
domains, remains a major challenge. Current paradigms either myopically
optimize single-turn attributes or rely on brittle, high-cost user simulators,
creating a persistent ``reality gap''. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\texttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a general, simulator-free framework for learning and
deploying proactive dialogue agents \textit{directly from offline expert data},
bypassing the need to model complex user dynamics. Our key insight is to
reframe the offline policy learning problem by leveraging the \textbf{observed
future} of each expert trajectory. This allows us to infer a dense,
turn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy,
decomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised
learning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \texttt{(action,
state_assessment)} tuple, governing both \textbf{what to ask} and, crucially,
\textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader
Calibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward
model with minimal human supervision. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy
of \texttt{Learn-to-Ask} in a real-world medical dataset, using LLMs of varying
sizes up to 32B. Our approach culminates in the successful deployment of LLMs
into a live, large-scale online AI service. In rigorous in-house evaluations,
our model was launched and achieved performance even superior to human experts,
proving our framework's ability to translate offline data into tangible,
real-world impact. We hope this work provides a practical and economically
viable blueprint for transforming passive LLMs into proactive, goal-oriented
LLM applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决快速演变的亚文化和俚语对自动化信息提取和执法监控带来的挑战，需要开发能够适应新兴语言趋势的高效文本处理系统。

Method: 使用LLaMA Factory框架对LLMs进行微调，包括通用和自定义领域特定数据集（特别是政治和安全领域），结合命名实体识别技术构建文本处理管道。

Result: 指令微调显著提高了摘要和标记准确性，特别是对于专业语料库。LLaMA3-8B-Instruct模型经过领域特定微调后，尽管初始中文理解有限，但表现优于中文训练对应模型，表明推理能力可以跨语言迁移。

Conclusion: LLMs与NER的集成为将非结构化文本转化为可操作洞察提供了强大解决方案，支持高效信息管理和现代知识管理及安全操作需求，具有可扩展性和实时应用适应性。

Abstract: This paper presents a pipeline integrating fine-tuned large language models
(LLMs) with named entity recognition (NER) for efficient domain-specific text
summarization and tagging. The authors address the challenge posed by rapidly
evolving sub-cultural languages and slang, which complicate automated
information extraction and law enforcement monitoring. By leveraging the LLaMA
Factory framework, the study fine-tunes LLMs on both generalpurpose and custom
domain-specific datasets, particularly in the political and security domains.
The models are evaluated using BLEU and ROUGE metrics, demonstrating that
instruction fine-tuning significantly enhances summarization and tagging
accuracy, especially for specialized corpora. Notably, the LLaMA3-8B-Instruct
model, despite its initial limitations in Chinese comprehension, outperforms
its Chinese-trained counterpart after domainspecific fine-tuning, suggesting
that underlying reasoning capabilities can transfer across languages. The
pipeline enables concise summaries and structured entity tagging, facilitating
rapid document categorization and distribution. This approach proves scalable
and adaptable for real-time applications, supporting efficient information
management and the ongoing need to capture emerging language trends. The
integration of LLMs and NER offers a robust solution for transforming
unstructured text into actionable insights, crucial for modern knowledge
management and security operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型人物模拟评估主要依赖合成对话，缺乏系统框架和能力需求分析，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 构建TwinVoice基准，包含社交角色、人际角色和叙事角色三个维度，并分解为意见一致性、记忆回忆、逻辑推理、词汇保真度、角色语气和句法风格六项能力评估。

Result: 实验结果显示，虽然先进模型在人物模拟方面达到中等准确度，但在句法风格和记忆回忆等能力上仍有不足，整体表现远低于人类基准。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在人物模拟方面仍有显著差距，特别是在句法风格和记忆回忆等关键能力上需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are exhibiting emergent human-like abilities and
are increasingly envisioned as the foundation for simulating an individual's
communication style, behavioral tendencies, and personality traits. However,
current evaluations of LLM-based persona simulation remain limited: most rely
on synthetic dialogues, lack systematic frameworks, and lack analysis of the
capability requirement. To address these limitations, we introduce TwinVoice, a
comprehensive benchmark for assessing persona simulation across diverse
real-world contexts. TwinVoice encompasses three dimensions: Social Persona
(public social interactions), Interpersonal Persona (private dialogues), and
Narrative Persona (role-based expression). It further decomposes the evaluation
of LLM performance into six fundamental capabilities, including opinion
consistency, memory recall, logical reasoning, lexical fidelity, persona tone,
and syntactic style. Experimental results reveal that while advanced models
achieve moderate accuracy in persona simulation, they still fall short of
capabilities such as syntactic style and memory recall. Consequently, the
average performance achieved by LLMs remains considerably below the human
baseline.

Motivation: 探索LLM智能体在信息不对称条件下如何协作完成共同目标，填补了现有研究在智能体协作方面的空白。

Method: 采用微调加验证器的框架，为LLM智能体配备不同的沟通策略和环境验证信号，在扩展的爱因斯坦谜题游戏中进行实验。

Result: 实验结果表明对齐的沟通至关重要，无沟通的智能体也能达到高任务完成率，但缺乏真正的规则理解和人类信任。环境验证器能增强智能体的规则理解能力。

Conclusion: 通过集成基于环境的验证器，可以增强智能体对任务规则的理解，促进AI系统中更安全、更可解释的协作。

Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM) agents are often approached from the angle
of action planning/generation to accomplish a goal (e.g., given by language
descriptions), their abilities to collaborate with each other to achieve a
joint goal are not well explored. To address this limitation, this paper
studies LLM agents in task collaboration, particularly under the condition of
information asymmetry, where agents have disparities in their knowledge and
skills and need to work together to complete a shared task. We extend Einstein
Puzzles, a classical symbolic puzzle, to a table-top game. In this game, two
LLM agents must reason, communicate, and act to satisfy spatial and relational
constraints required to solve the puzzle. We apply a fine-tuning-plus-verifier
framework in which LLM agents are equipped with various communication
strategies and verification signals from the environment. Empirical results
highlight the critical importance of aligned communication, especially when
agents possess both information-seeking and -providing capabilities.
Interestingly, agents without communication can still achieve high task
performance; however, further analysis reveals a lack of true rule
understanding and lower trust from human evaluators. Instead, by integrating an
environment-based verifier, we enhance agents' ability to comprehend task rules
and complete tasks, promoting both safer and more interpretable collaboration
in AI systems. https://github.com/Roihn/EinsteinPuzzles

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在宗教问答等高风险专业领域中存在的幻觉问题和对权威来源不忠实的问题，特别是针对波斯语穆斯林社区的需求。

Method: 采用FAIR-RAG架构：一个忠实、自适应、迭代优化的RAG框架，通过动态自校正过程分解复杂查询，评估证据充分性，并通过迭代生成子查询来填补信息空白。

Result: 在伊斯兰PCQA基准测试中表现出色：负拒绝率达到97.0%（比基线提高40个百分点），答案正确率达到74.3%。

Conclusion: 该工作为波斯伊斯兰问答设立了新标准，验证了迭代自适应架构在敏感领域构建忠实可靠AI系统的重要性。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Natural
Language Processing, yet their application in high-stakes, specialized domains
like religious question answering is hindered by challenges like hallucination
and unfaithfulness to authoritative sources. This issue is particularly
critical for the Persian-speaking Muslim community, where accuracy and
trustworthiness are paramount. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems, relying on simplistic single-pass pipelines, fall short on complex,
multi-hop queries requiring multi-step reasoning and evidence aggregation. To
address this gap, we introduce FARSIQA, a novel, end-to-end system for Faithful
Advanced Question Answering in the Persian Islamic domain. FARSIQA is built
upon our innovative FAIR-RAG architecture: a Faithful, Adaptive, Iterative
Refinement framework for RAG. FAIR-RAG employs a dynamic, self-correcting
process: it adaptively decomposes complex queries, assesses evidence
sufficiency, and enters an iterative loop to generate sub-queries,
progressively filling information gaps. Operating on a curated knowledge base
of over one million authoritative Islamic documents, FARSIQA demonstrates
superior performance. Rigorous evaluation on the challenging IslamicPCQA
benchmark shows state-of-the-art performance: the system achieves a remarkable
97.0% in Negative Rejection - a 40-point improvement over baselines - and a
high Answer Correctness score of 74.3%. Our work establishes a new standard for
Persian Islamic QA and validates that our iterative, adaptive architecture is
crucial for building faithful, reliable AI systems in sensitive domains.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) techniques can improve the performance of large
language models (LLMs) at the expense of additional computation and latency.
While TTS has proven effective in formal domains such as mathematics and
programming \citep{snell2024scaling, chen2024more}, its value in argumentative
domains such as law remains underexplored. We present an empirical study of
verifier-based TTS methods for legal multiple-choice QA (MCQA) across five
benchmarks. Using a family of 7 reward models, we evaluate both outcome-level
(Best-of-$N$) and process-level (tree search) verification under realistic
low-$N$ budgets. Our analysis systematically investigates how verifier utility
is affected by key properties such as domain specialization, model size, and
supervision type (process-supervised PRMs vs. outcome-only ORMs), even when
applied across different roles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估只关注正确性而忽视效率，但真实推理场景中大量信息是无关的，有效推理需要识别并忽略这些干扰。

Method: 提出基于逻辑编程的评估框架，将自然语言证明与逻辑程序找到的最短证明对齐，量化推理效率；构建包含无关公理的数学应用题数据集。

Result: 当前语言模型在存在干扰时准确率显著下降，即使是最小且领域一致的干扰；生成的证明经常包含无关推理的绕路。

Conclusion: 语言模型在推理效率方面存在不足，需要改进以避免不必要的推理步骤。

Abstract: Modern language models (LMs) exhibit strong deductive reasoning capabilities,
yet standard evaluations emphasize correctness while overlooking a key aspect
of human-like reasoning: efficiency. In real-world reasoning scenarios, much of
the available information is irrelevant, and effective deductive inference
requires identifying and ignoring such distractions. We propose a framework for
assessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming,
introducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as
generated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic
program. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids
unnecessary inference. Empirically, we construct a dataset of math word
problems injected with various number of irrelevant axioms that vary in
semantic overlap with the goal theorem. We find that current LMs show marked
accuracy declines under such conditions -- even with minimal, domain-consistent
distractions -- and the proofs they generate frequently exhibit detours through
irrelevant inferences.

Motivation: 电子健康记录包含丰富但复杂的信息，现有大语言模型在EHR分析方面存在任务覆盖范围窄和缺乏EHR导向推理能力的问题。

Method: 开发了思维图驱动的框架生成大规模高质量推理数据，通过多阶段训练范式（领域适应、推理增强和强化学习）构建EHR-R1模型系列。

Result: EHR-R1在MIMIC-Bench上超越GPT-4o超过30分，在EHRSHOT上零样本AUROC提高10%，显著优于最先进的商业和开源LLM。

Conclusion: EHR-Ins、EHR-R1和EHR-Bench共同推动了更可靠和临床相关的EHR分析发展。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich yet complex information, and
their automated analysis is critical for clinical decision-making. Despite
recent advances of large language models (LLMs) in clinical workflows, their
ability to analyze EHRs remains limited due to narrow task coverage and lack of
EHR-oriented reasoning capabilities. This paper aims to bridge the gap,
specifically, we present EHR-Ins, a large-scale, comprehensive EHR reasoning
instruction dataset, comprising 300k high-quality reasoning cases and 4M
non-reasoning cases across 42 distinct EHR tasks. Its core innovation is a
thinking-graph-driven framework that enables to generate high-quality reasoning
data at scale. Based on it, we develop EHR-R1, a series of reasoning-enhanced
LLMs with up to 72B parameters tailored for EHR analysis. Through a multi-stage
training paradigm, including domain adaptation, reasoning enhancement, and
reinforcement learning, EHR-R1 systematically acquires domain knowledge and
diverse reasoning capabilities, enabling accurate and robust EHR analysis.
Lastly, we introduce EHR-Bench, a new benchmark curated from MIMIC-IV, spanning
42 tasks, to comprehensively assess reasoning and prediction across EHR
scenarios. In experiments, we show that the resulting EHR-R1 consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs (including
DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o), surpassing GPT-4o by over 30 points on MIMIC-Bench and
achieving a 10\% higher zero-shot AUROC on EHRSHOT. Collectively, EHR-Ins,
EHR-R1, and EHR-Bench have significantly advanced the development for more
reliable and clinically relevant EHR analysis.

Motivation: 统一视觉语言模型需要同时处理理解和生成任务，但这些任务依赖异构数据和监督，在强化学习中难以平衡。

Method: 使用GPT-o3增强单任务数据，形成对齐的理解-生成对；检索语义相关的理解样本形成检索对；提出Pair-GPRO优化方法，基于相似度评分调节优势函数。

Result: 在Janus-Pro等统一视觉语言模型上实现了平衡的改进，优于现有强化学习基线方法。

Conclusion: PairUni框架通过数据配对和相应的优化策略，有效解决了统一视觉语言模型中任务平衡问题。

Abstract: Unified vision-language models (UVLMs) must perform both understanding and
generation within a single architecture, but these tasks rely on heterogeneous
data and supervision, making it difficult to balance them during reinforcement
learning (RL). We propose PairUni, a unified framework that reorganizes data
into understanding-generation (UG) pairs and aligns optimization accordingly.
We first use GPT-o3 to augment single-task data, generating captions for
understanding samples and question-answer (QA) pairs for generation samples,
forming aligned pairs from the same instance. Additionally, for each generation
sample, we retrieve a semantically related understanding example to form a
retrieved pair, linking different but related data points. These paired
structures expose cross-task semantic correspondences and support consistent
policy learning. To leverage this structure, we present Pair-GPRO, a pair-aware
variant based on Group Relative Policy Optimization. It assigns a similarity
score to each pair to modulate the advantage, strengthening learning from
well-aligned examples and reducing task interference. We curate a high-quality
dataset of 16K UG pairs named PairUG for RL fine-tuning and evaluate PairUni on
the powerful Janus-Pro UVLMs. Our approach achieves balanced improvements on
various UVLMs, outperforming strong UVLM RL baselines. Code:

Result: LLM能够识别关键金融风险指标，但其特征重要性排序与LightGBM显著不同，自解释与经验SHAP归因不一致

Conclusion: LLM作为结构化金融风险预测的独立模型存在局限性，其自解释可信度存疑，需要可解释性审计、与可解释模型基线比较以及人类监督

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as flexible
alternatives to classical machine learning models for classification tasks
through zero-shot prompting. However, their suitability for structured tabular
data remains underexplored, especially in high-stakes financial applications
such as financial risk assessment. This study conducts a systematic comparison
between zero-shot LLM-based classifiers and LightGBM, a state-of-the-art
gradient-boosting model, on a real-world loan default prediction task. We
evaluate their predictive performance, analyze feature attributions using SHAP,
and assess the reliability of LLM-generated self-explanations. While LLMs are
able to identify key financial risk indicators, their feature importance
rankings diverge notably from LightGBM, and their self-explanations often fail
to align with empirical SHAP attributions. These findings highlight the
limitations of LLMs as standalone models for structured financial risk

explanations. Our results underscore the need for explainability audits,

TL;DR: Toolathlon是一个用于评估语言代理的基准测试，涵盖32个软件应用和604个工具，提供真实环境设置和执行评估，旨在解决现有基准测试在多样性、真实性和长期复杂性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言代理基准测试通常关注狭窄领域或简化任务，缺乏评估代理在真实世界性能所需的多样性、真实性和长期复杂性。

Method: 基于高质量MCP服务器集，提供来自真实软件的初始环境状态，包含108个手动收集或设计的任务，每个任务平均需要约20轮交互才能完成。

Result: 评估显示SOTA模型存在显著不足：表现最佳的Claude-4.5-Sonnet成功率仅38.6%，平均工具调用20.2轮；最佳开源模型DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp成功率为20.1%。

Conclusion: Toolathlon有望推动开发更强大的语言代理，以执行真实世界的长期任务。

Abstract: Real-world language agents must handle complex, multi-step workflows across
diverse Apps. For instance, an agent may manage emails by coordinating with
calendars and file systems, or monitor a production database to detect
anomalies and generate reports following an operating manual. However, existing
language agent benchmarks often focus on narrow domains or simplified tasks
that lack the diversity, realism, and long-horizon complexity required to
evaluate agents' real-world performance. To address this gap, we introduce the
Tool Decathlon (dubbed as Toolathlon), a benchmark for language agents offering
diverse Apps and tools, realistic environment setup, and reliable
execution-based evaluation. Toolathlon spans 32 software applications and 604
tools, ranging from everyday platforms such as Google Calendar and Notion to
professional ones like WooCommerce, Kubernetes, and BigQuery. Most of the tools
are based on a high-quality set of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that we
may have revised or implemented ourselves. Unlike prior works, which primarily
ensure functional realism but offer limited environment state diversity, we
provide realistic initial environment states from real software, such as Canvas
courses with dozens of students or real financial spreadsheets. This benchmark
includes 108 manually sourced or crafted tasks in total, requiring interacting
with multiple Apps over around 20 turns on average to complete. Each task is
strictly verifiable through dedicated evaluation scripts. Comprehensive
evaluation of SOTA models highlights their significant shortcomings: the
best-performing model, Claude-4.5-Sonnet, achieves only a 38.6% success rate
with 20.2 tool calling turns on average, while the top open-weights model
DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp reaches 20.1%. We expect Toolathlon to drive the development
of more capable language agents for real-world, long-horizon task execution.

### [137] [The Limits of Obliviate: Evaluating Unlearning in LLMs via Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25732)
*Aakriti Shah,Thai Le*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了通过说服性提示从故意遗忘的大语言模型中恢复事实知识，发现说服性提示能显著增强事实回忆，且效果与模型大小成反比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型中的遗忘对于管理敏感数据和纠正错误信息至关重要，但评估其有效性仍是一个开放问题。

Method: 基于ACT-R和Hebbian理论（扩散激活理论）以及传播学原理，提出了刺激-知识纠缠-行为框架（SKeB），通过领域图建模信息纠缠，并测试事实回忆是否与说服性框架相关。

Result: 说服性提示显著增强了事实知识回忆（基线14.8% vs 权威框架24.5%），有效性随模型大小增加而降低（2.7B模型恢复128% vs 13B模型恢复15%）。

Conclusion: SKeB为评估大语言模型中的遗忘完整性、鲁棒性和整体行为提供了基础。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for managing sensitive
data and correcting misinformation, yet evaluating its effectiveness remains an
open problem. We investigate whether persuasive prompting can recall factual
knowledge from deliberately unlearned LLMs across models ranging from 2.7B to
13B parameters (OPT-2.7B, LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-2-13B). Drawing from
ACT-R and Hebbian theory (spreading activation theories), as well as
communication principles, we introduce Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior
Framework (SKeB), which models information entanglement via domain graphs and
tests whether factual recall in unlearned models is correlated with persuasive
framing. We develop entanglement metrics to quantify knowledge activation
patterns and evaluate factuality, non-factuality, and hallucination in outputs.
Our results show persuasive prompts substantially enhance factual knowledge
recall (14.8% baseline vs. 24.5% with authority framing), with effectiveness
inversely correlated to model size (128% recovery in 2.7B vs. 15% in 13B). SKeB
provides a foundation for assessing unlearning completeness, robustness, and
overall behavior in LLMs.

TL;DR: Ouro是一个预训练的循环语言模型，通过在潜在空间进行迭代计算和熵正则化目标来构建推理能力，在1.4B和2.6B参数规模下达到12B参数模型的性能水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LLM主要通过显式文本生成（如思维链）进行推理，这忽视了预训练数据的充分利用，将推理推迟到训练后阶段。

Method: 提出循环语言模型，在预训练阶段通过(i)潜在空间迭代计算、(ii)熵正则化目标进行学习深度分配、(iii)扩展到7.7T tokens来构建推理能力。

Result: Ouro 1.4B和2.6B模型在广泛基准测试中匹配了12B参数SOTA LLM的结果，优势来自更好的知识操作能力而非知识容量增加。

Conclusion: 循环语言模型展示了在推理时代作为一种新颖扩展方向的潜力，其推理轨迹比显式思维链更符合最终输出。

Abstract: Modern LLMs are trained to "think" primarily via explicit text generation,
such as chain-of-thought (CoT), which defers reasoning to post-training and
under-leverages pre-training data. We present and open-source Ouro, named after
the recursive Ouroboros, a family of pre-trained Looped Language Models
(LoopLM) that instead build reasoning into the pre-training phase through (i)
iterative computation in latent space, (ii) an entropy-regularized objective
for learned depth allocation, and (iii) scaling to 7.7T tokens. Ouro 1.4B and
2.6B models enjoy superior performance that match the results of up to 12B SOTA
LLMs across a wide range of benchmarks. Through controlled experiments, we show
this advantage stems not from increased knowledge capacity, but from superior
knowledge manipulation capabilities. We also show that LoopLM yields reasoning
traces more aligned with final outputs than explicit CoT. We hope our results
show the potential of LoopLM as a novel scaling direction in the reasoning era.

TL;DR: 提出从一次性任务完成评估转向协作代理评估，引入协作努力扩展框架来衡量代理在用户参与增加时的效用增长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代理评估主要关注一次性任务完成，忽视了现实世界中问题的迭代和协作性质，人类目标往往不明确且会演变。

Method: 引入协作努力扩展框架，通过案例研究和模拟评估分析代理在多轮、真实场景中的表现。

Result: 研究发现最先进的代理在多轮真实场景中表现不佳，缺乏维持参与和构建用户理解的能力。

Conclusion: 协作努力扩展为诊断代理行为和指导开发更有效交互提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Current evaluations of agents remain centered around one-shot task
completion, failing to account for the inherently iterative and collaborative
nature of many real-world problems, where human goals are often underspecified
and evolve. We argue for a shift from building and assessing task completion
agents to developing collaborative agents, assessed not only by the quality of
their final outputs but by how well they engage with and enhance human effort
throughout the problem-solving process. To support this shift, we introduce
collaborative effort scaling, a framework that captures how an agent's utility
grows with increasing user involvement. Through case studies and simulated
evaluations, we show that state-of-the-art agents often underperform in
multi-turn, real-world scenarios, revealing a missing ingredient in agent
design: the ability to sustain engagement and scaffold user understanding.
Collaborative effort scaling offers a lens for diagnosing agent behavior and
guiding development toward more effective interactions.

Motivation: 图表在研究论文中很重要但制作复杂，现有图像生成模型难以生成结构清晰的图表，而LLM生成的SVG图表缺乏有效的评估指标。

Result: 首次有效评估了最先进LLM在近期研究文献上生成的图表，定量证明了所提指标的有效性。

Conclusion: DiagramEval提供了可解释的图表评估指标，为理解LLM生成图表的特性提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Diagrams play a central role in research papers for conveying ideas, yet they
are often notoriously complex and labor-intensive to create. Although diagrams
are presented as images, standard image generative models struggle to produce
clear diagrams with well-defined structure. We argue that a promising direction
is to generate demonstration diagrams directly in textual form as SVGs, which
can leverage recent advances in large language models (LLMs). However, due to
the complexity of components and the multimodal nature of diagrams,
sufficiently discriminative and explainable metrics for evaluating the quality
of LLM-generated diagrams remain lacking. In this paper, we propose
DiagramEval, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess demonstration
diagrams generated by LLMs. Specifically, DiagramEval conceptualizes diagrams
as graphs, treating text elements as nodes and their connections as directed
edges, and evaluates diagram quality using two new groups of metrics: node
alignment and path alignment. For the first time, we effectively evaluate
diagrams produced by state-of-the-art LLMs on recent research literature,
quantitatively demonstrating the validity of our metrics. Furthermore, we show
how the enhanced explainability of our proposed metrics offers valuable
insights into the characteristics of LLM-generated diagrams. Code:

Motivation: 现有的事后归因方法在需要跨段落信息合成的多跳、抽象和半提取式问答中表现不佳，需要更可靠的归因机制来建立信任。

Method: 将事后归因重构为推理问题，通过DecompTune方法教导模型生成答案分解作为中间推理步骤，使用两阶段SFT + GRPO流水线进行后训练。

Result: DecompTune显著提高了归因质量，超越了先前方法，并与最先进的前沿模型表现相当或更优。

Conclusion: 将归因作为推理问题处理，通过答案分解方法可以有效提升LLM在复杂问答任务中的归因可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for long-document question
answering, where reliable attribution to sources is critical for trust.
Existing post-hoc attribution methods work well for extractive QA but struggle
in multi-hop, abstractive, and semi-extractive settings, where answers
synthesize information across passages. To address these challenges, we argue
that post-hoc attribution can be reframed as a reasoning problem, where answers
are decomposed into constituent units, each tied to specific context. We first
show that prompting models to generate such decompositions alongside
attributions improves performance. Building on this, we introduce DecompTune, a
post-training method that teaches models to produce answer decompositions as
intermediate reasoning steps. We curate a diverse dataset of complex QA tasks,
annotated with decompositions by a strong LLM, and post-train Qwen-2.5 (7B and
14B) using a two-stage SFT + GRPO pipeline with task-specific curated rewards.
Across extensive experiments and ablations, DecompTune substantially improves
attribution quality, outperforming prior methods and matching or exceeding
state-of-the-art frontier models.

TL;DR: Gaperon是一个完全开源的法国-英语-编程语言模型套件，包含1.5B、8B和24B参数模型，训练数据达2-4万亿token，并公开了完整的训练流程和中间检查点。研究发现数据过滤与测试集污染之间存在复杂的相互作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动大规模模型训练的透明度和可复现性，研究数据过滤和污染如何影响模型在基准测试和生成性能上的表现。

Method: 使用神经质量分类器过滤法语和英语数据集，开发高效的数据整理和训练框架，并引入无害数据投毒来支持安全研究。

Result: 发现语言质量过滤能提升文本流畅性和连贯性，但基准测试结果较差；而后期故意污染（在包含测试集的数据上继续训练）能恢复竞争力得分，同时只适度损害生成质量。

Conclusion: Gaperon为探索多语言语言模型开发中的数据整理、评估、安全性和开放性之间的权衡提供了可复现的基础，揭示了常规神经过滤可能无意中放大基准泄漏的问题。

Abstract: We release Gaperon, a fully open suite of French-English-coding language
models designed to advance transparency and reproducibility in large-scale
model training. The Gaperon family includes 1.5B, 8B, and 24B parameter models
trained on 2-4 trillion tokens, released with all elements of the training
pipeline: French and English datasets filtered with a neural quality
classifier, an efficient data curation and training framework, and hundreds of
intermediate checkpoints. Through this work, we study how data filtering and
contamination interact to shape both benchmark and generative performance. We
find that filtering for linguistic quality enhances text fluency and coherence
but yields subpar benchmark results, and that late deliberate contamination --
continuing training on data mixes that include test sets -- recovers
competitive scores while only reasonably harming generation quality. We discuss
how usual neural filtering can unintentionally amplify benchmark leakage. To
support further research, we also introduce harmless data poisoning during
pretraining, providing a realistic testbed for safety studies. By openly
releasing all models, datasets, code, and checkpoints, Gaperon establishes a
reproducible foundation for exploring the trade-offs between data curation,
evaluation, safety, and openness in multilingual language model development.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于推理树结构的新调度算法Re-Schedule，通过r-score衡量查询学习难度，从简单到复杂安排训练顺序，在数学推理基准上显著提升准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR数据调度方法依赖路径指标对查询排序，忽略了查询的推理树结构信息。

Method: 引入推理分数(r-score)衡量查询学习难度，基于此提出Re-Schedule调度算法，构建从结构简单到复杂的课程学习顺序。

Result: 在6个数学推理基准测试中，Re-Schedule显著提升平均准确率，最高增益达3.2%。

Conclusion: 对推理树的结构理解为RLVR数据调度提供了更强大和原则性的基础。

Abstract: Using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize Large
Language Models (LLMs) can be conceptualized as progressively editing a query's
`Reasoning Tree'. This process involves exploring nodes (tokens) and
dynamically modifying the model's policy at each node. When combined with data
scheduling, this process yields further gains in data efficiency and accuracy.
However, existing RLVR data scheduling methods typically rely on path-based
metrics to rank queries, overlooking the reasoning tree structures of these
queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric, namely Reasoning Score
(r-score), which measures the query's learning difficulty based on the
structure of its reasoning tree. Based on the r-score, we propose the Reasoning
Tree Schedule (Re-Schedule), a scheduling algorithm that constructs a
curriculum progressing from structurally simple (high r-score) to complex (low
r-score) queries. Experiments on six math-reasoning benchmarks show that
Re-Schedule significantly improves average accuracy, achieving gains of up to
3.2%. These strong results validate our approach and demonstrate that a
structural understanding of the reasoning tree provides a more powerful and
principled foundation for RLVR data scheduling.

Abstract: Most counterfactual inference frameworks traditionally assume acyclic
structural causal models (SCMs), i.e. directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). However,
many real-world systems (e.g. biological systems) contain feedback loops or
cyclic dependencies that violate acyclicity. In this work, we study
counterfactual inference in cyclic SCMs under shift-scale interventions, i.e.,
soft, policy-style changes that rescale and/or shift a variable's mechanism.

Motivation: 自动化E/M编码可以减轻医生的文档负担，提高计费效率，最终实现更好的患者护理，但现实世界的复杂性使这项任务具有挑战性

Method: 开发了基于LLM的ProFees框架，专门解决E/M编码中的现实复杂性

Result: 在专家策划的真实数据集上，ProFees比商业CPT E/M编码系统准确率提高36%以上，比最强的单提示基线提高近5%

Conclusion: ProFees框架有效解决了E/M编码自动化中的现实复杂性，展示了其在实际应用中的有效性

Abstract: Evaluation and Management (E/M) coding, under the Current Procedural
Terminology (CPT) taxonomy, documents medical services provided to patients by
physicians. Used primarily for billing purposes, it is in physicians' best
interest to provide accurate CPT E/M codes. %While important, it is an
auxiliary task that adds to physicians' documentation burden. Automating this
coding task will help alleviate physicians' documentation burden, improve
billing efficiency, and ultimately enable better patient care. However, a
number of real-world complexities have made E/M encoding automation a
challenging task. In this paper, we elaborate some of the key complexities and
present ProFees, our LLM-based framework that tackles them, followed by a
systematic evaluation. On an expert-curated real-world dataset, ProFees
achieves an increase in coding accuracy of more than 36\% over a commercial CPT
E/M coding system and almost 5\% over our strongest single-prompt baseline,
demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the real-world complexities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在游戏交互中具有动态性，但无法遵循规则治理的交易系统的基本程序流程，这会削弱玩家信任。需要解决LLM创意灵活性与游戏交易程序要求之间的冲突。

Method: 引入ASTP方法，通过精心设计的提示词强制LLM使其状态跟踪过程显式化和可验证。LLM需要识别并报告前一回合的预定义状态标签。结合状态特定的占位符后处理方法确保交易完整性。

Result: 在300个交易对话评估中，状态合规性超过99%，计算精度达到99.3%。ASTP结合占位符后处理在较小模型(Gemini-2.5-Flash)上匹配较大模型(Gemini-2.5-Pro)性能，同时将响应时间从21.2秒减少到2.4秒。

Conclusion: ASTP建立了一个实用基础，既满足商业游戏的实时要求，又符合资源约束，为LLM在规则治理系统中可靠应用提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable dynamic game interactions but fail to
follow essential procedural flows in rule-governed trading systems, eroding
player trust. This work resolves the core tension between the creative
flexibility of LLMs and the procedural demands of in-game trading
(browse-offer-review-confirm). To this end, Autoregressive State-Tracking
Prompting (ASTP) is introduced, a methodology centered on a strategically
orchestrated prompt that compels an LLM to make its state-tracking process
explicit and verifiable. Instead of relying on implicit contextual
understanding, ASTP tasks the LLM with identifying and reporting a predefined
state label from the previous turn. To ensure transactional integrity, this is
complemented by a state-specific placeholder post-processing method for
accurate price calculations. Evaluation across 300 trading dialogues
demonstrates >99% state compliance and 99.3% calculation precision. Notably,
ASTP with placeholder post-processing on smaller models (Gemini-2.5-Flash)
matches larger models' (Gemini-2.5-Pro) performance while reducing response
time from 21.2s to 2.4s, establishing a practical foundation that satisfies
both real-time requirements and resource constraints of commercial games.

Result: 在五个基准测试上的实证结果表明，PM4GRPO显著优于现有的GRPO后训练方法。

Conclusion: 通过过程挖掘实现推理感知的GRPO能够有效增强策略模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training has been crucial for enabling
multi-step reasoning in large reasoning models (LRMs), yet current reward
schemes are typically outcome-centric. We propose PM4GRPO, a reasoning-aware
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that augments standard answer/format
rewards with signals over the reasoning procedure. To this end, process mining
techniques are utilized to compute a scalar conformance reward that measures
how closely a policy model's reasoning aligns with the pretrained teacher
model. The empirical results on five benchmarks demonstrate that PM4GRPO
significantly outperforms existing methodologies for GRPO-based post-training.
These results highlight that leveraging process mining for reasoning-aware GRPO
effectively enhances the reasoning capabilities of policy models.

Abstract: Stock movement prediction remains fundamentally challenging due to complex
temporal dependencies, heterogeneous modalities, and dynamically evolving
inter-stock relationships. Existing approaches often fail to unify structural,
semantic, and regime-adaptive modeling within a scalable framework. This work
introduces H3M-SSMoEs, a novel Hypergraph-based MultiModal architecture with
LLM reasoning and Style-Structured Mixture of Experts, integrating three key
innovations: (1) a Multi-Context Multimodal Hypergraph that hierarchically
captures fine-grained spatiotemporal dynamics via a Local Context Hypergraph
(LCH) and persistent inter-stock dependencies through a Global Context
Hypergraph (GCH), employing shared cross-modal hyperedges and Jensen-Shannon
Divergence weighting mechanism for adaptive relational learning and cross-modal
alignment; (2) a LLM-enhanced reasoning module, which leverages a frozen large
language model with lightweight adapters to semantically fuse and align
quantitative and textual modalities, enriching representations with
domain-specific financial knowledge; and (3) a Style-Structured Mixture of
Experts (SSMoEs) that combines shared market experts and industry-specialized
experts, each parameterized by learnable style vectors enabling regime-aware
specialization under sparse activation. Extensive experiments on three major
stock markets demonstrate that H3M-SSMoEs surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
both superior predictive accuracy and investment performance, while exhibiting
effective risk control. Datasets, source code, and model weights are available

Abstract: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural-language
questions over a structured Knowledge Base (KB). Recent work improves KBQA by
adopting an agentic reasoning paradigm, in which Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively decompose a question, generate its corresponding logical queries,
and interact with the KB to derive the answer. However, these methods typically
fine-tune LLMs on reasoning trajectories synthesized via process supervision,
which offers weak incentives for exploration and thus fails to strengthen the
agentic reasoning ability. In this paper, we propose KnowCoder-A1, an LLM that
can autonomously perform agentic reasoning on KBs to obtain answers. To
incentivize autonomous exploration, KnowCoder-A1 trains the LLM under
outcome-only supervision via a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning
with an easy-to-hard curriculum. To establish foundational agentic
capabilities, KnowCoder-A1 first fine-tunes the LLM on a small set of
high-quality trajectories obtained through outcome-based rejection sampling.
Then, to alleviate the reward sparsity inherent in outcome-only supervision, it
applies multi-stage curriculum RL with reward schedules that progress from easy
to hard. Trained with outcome-only supervision, KnowCoder-A1 exhibits powerful
reasoning behaviors and consistently outperforms prior approaches across three
mainstream datasets. Notably, on the zero-shot subset of GrailQA, KnowCoder-A1
achieves up to an 11.1% relative improvement while using only one-twelfth of
the training data, demonstrating strong agentic reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 将智能体方法扩展到安全对齐领域，解决现有方法作为静态层应用、仅提供二元分类的局限性，实现更灵活和细粒度的安全执行。

Method: 引入动态协作的智能体系统，包括Shield、Responder、Evaluator和Reflector，实现上下文感知和可解释的审核。

Result: 在五个数据集和四个大型视觉语言模型上的实验表明，该方法将攻击成功率降低7-19%，保持稳定的不跟随率，并将拒绝率提高4-20%。

Conclusion: Agentic Moderation通过利用智能体架构的灵活性和推理能力，提供了模块化、可扩展和细粒度的安全执行，展示了智能体系统作为自动化安全治理基础的潜力。

Abstract: Agentic methods have emerged as a powerful and autonomous paradigm that
enhances reasoning, collaboration, and adaptive control, enabling systems to
coordinate and independently solve complex tasks. We extend this paradigm to
safety alignment by introducing Agentic Moderation, a model-agnostic framework
that leverages specialised agents to defend multimodal systems against
jailbreak attacks. Unlike prior approaches that apply as a static layer over
inputs or outputs and provide only binary classifications (safe or unsafe), our
method integrates dynamic, cooperative agents, including Shield, Responder,
Evaluator, and Reflector, to achieve context-aware and interpretable
moderation. Extensive experiments across five datasets and four representative
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate that our approach reduces the
Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 7-19%, maintains a stable Non-Following Rate (NF),
and improves the Refusal Rate (RR) by 4-20%, achieving robust, interpretable,
and well-balanced safety performance. By harnessing the flexibility and
reasoning capacity of agentic architectures, Agentic Moderation provides
modular, scalable, and fine-grained safety enforcement, highlighting the
broader potential of agentic systems as a foundation for automated safety
governance.

Abstract: Autonomous driving is an emerging technology that is expected to bring
significant social, economic, and environmental benefits. However, these
benefits come with rising energy consumption by computation engines, limiting
the driving range of vehicles, especially electric ones. Perception computing
is typically the most power-intensive component, as it relies on largescale
deep learning models to extract environmental features. Recently, numerous
studies have employed model compression techniques, such as sparsification,
quantization, and distillation, to reduce computational consumption. However,
these methods often result in either a substantial model size or a significant
drop in perception accuracy compared to high-computation models. To address
these challenges, we propose an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework,
called EneAD. In the adaptive perception module, a perception optimization
strategy is designed from the perspective of data management and tuning.
Firstly, we manage multiple perception models with different computational
consumption and adjust the execution framerate dynamically. Then, we define
them as knobs and design a transferable tuning method based on Bayesian
optimization to identify promising knob values that achieve low computation
while maintaining desired accuracy. To adaptively switch the knob values in
various traffic scenarios, a lightweight classification model is proposed to
distinguish the perception difficulty in different scenarios. In the robust
decision module, we propose a decision model based on reinforcement learning
and design a regularization term to enhance driving stability in the face of
perturbed perception results. Extensive experiments evidence the superiority of
our framework in both energy consumption and driving performance. EneAD can
reduce perception consumption by 1.9x to 3.5x and thus improve driving range by
3.9% to 8.5%

Motivation: 受认知科学启发，发现"为什么这是答案"比"答案是什么"更容易回答，因为避免了开放式探索的认知负担，转而进行解释性重建。

Method: 引入RAVR框架，使用答案条件推理作为问题推理的变分代理，通过答案引导生成高质量推理路径。

Conclusion: 答案条件推理能显著提高采样推理路径的期望效用，将难以处理的问题转化为可学习的问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can refine the reasoning abilities of large
language models (LLMs), but critically depends on a key prerequisite: the LLM
can already generate high-utility reasoning paths with non-negligible
probability. For tasks beyond the LLM's current competence, such reasoning path
can be hard to sample, and learning risks reinforcing familiar but suboptimal
reasoning. We are motivated by the insight from cognitive science that Why is
this the answer is often an easier question than What is the answer, as it
avoids the heavy cognitive load of open-ended exploration, opting instead for
explanatory reconstruction-systematically retracing the reasoning that links a
question to its answer. We show that LLMs can similarly leverage answers to
derive high-quality reasoning paths. We formalize this phenomenon and prove
that conditioning on answer provably increases the expected utility of sampled
reasoning paths, thereby transforming intractable problems into learnable ones.
Building on this insight, we introduce RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided
Variational Reasoning), an end-to-end framework that uses answer-conditioned
reasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning. Experiments
in both general and math domains demonstrate consistent improvements over
strong baselines. We further analyze the reasoning behavior and find that RAVR
reduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes
problem-specific strategies in reasoning.

Conclusion: 基于LLM的多代理系统有潜力成为复杂现实环境中自动化、可解释和自适应特征工程的通用框架。

Abstract: Event log data, recording fine-grained user actions and system events,
represent one of the most valuable assets for modern digital services. However,
the complexity and heterogeneity of industrial event logs--characterized by
large scale, high dimensionality, diverse data types, and intricate temporal or
relational structures--make feature engineering extremely challenging. Existing
automatic feature engineering approaches, such as AutoML or genetic methods,
often suffer from limited explainability, rigid predefined operations, and poor
adaptability to complicated heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose FELA
(Feature Engineering LLM Agents), a multi-agent evolutionary system that
autonomously extracts meaningful and high-performing features from complex
industrial event log data. FELA integrates the reasoning and coding
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with an insight-guided
self-evolution paradigm. Specifically, FELA employs specialized agents--Idea
Agents, Code Agents, and Critic Agents--to collaboratively generate, validate,
and implement novel feature ideas. An Evaluation Agent summarizes feedback and
updates a hierarchical knowledge base and dual-memory system to enable
continual improvement. Moreover, FELA introduces an agentic evolution
algorithm, combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm principles to
balance exploration and exploitation across the idea space. Extensive
experiments on real industrial datasets demonstrate that FELA can generate
explainable, domain-relevant features that significantly improve model
performance while reducing manual effort. Our results highlight the potential
of LLM-based multi-agent systems as a general framework for automated,
interpretable, and adaptive feature engineering in complex real-world
environments.

Abstract: Psychiatric comorbidity is clinically significant yet challenging due to the
complexity of multiple co-occurring disorders. To address this, we develop a
novel approach integrating synthetic patient electronic medical record (EMR)
construction and multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation. We create 502
synthetic EMRs for common comorbid conditions using a pipeline that ensures

supporting over 130 diagnostic states while maintaining clinical standards.
Through this rigorous process, we construct PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale
dialogue dataset supporting comorbidity, containing 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic
dialogues validated by psychiatrists. This dataset enhances diagnostic accuracy
and treatment planning, offering a valuable resource for psychiatric
comorbidity research. Compared to real-world clinical transcripts, PsyCoTalk
exhibits high structural and linguistic fidelity in terms of dialogue length,

TL;DR: GAP框架通过图规划实现工具并行执行，显著提升多步推理任务的效率和准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如ReAct依赖顺序推理，无法利用独立子任务的并行性，导致工具利用效率低下

Method: 训练智能体基础模型将复杂任务分解为依赖感知的子任务图，自适应确定并行和顺序执行策略

Result: 在MHQA数据集上显著优于传统ReAct基线，特别是在多步检索任务中，通过智能并行化大幅提升工具调用效率

Conclusion: 图规划方法能够有效解决顺序推理瓶颈，实现更高效的工具利用和任务执行

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown
impressive capabilities in tool manipulation for complex task-solving. However,
existing paradigms such as ReAct rely on sequential reasoning and execution,
failing to exploit the inherent parallelism among independent sub-tasks. This
sequential bottleneck leads to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal
performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios. We introduce Graph-based Agent
Planning (GAP), a novel framework that explicitly models inter-task
dependencies through graph-based planning to enable adaptive parallel and
serial tool execution. Our approach trains agent foundation models to decompose
complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining
which tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential
dependencies. This dependency-aware orchestration achieves substantial
improvements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy. To train GAP, we
construct a high-quality dataset of graph-based planning traces derived from
the Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) benchmark. We employ a two-stage
training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the curated dataset,
followed by reinforcement learning (RL) with a correctness-based reward
function on strategically sampled queries where tool-based reasoning provides
maximum value. Experimental results on MHQA datasets demonstrate that GAP
significantly outperforms traditional ReAct baselines, particularly on
multi-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool
invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization. The project page is

TL;DR: 提出了KVDA-UCT算法，通过分析即时奖励推断价值差异，在MCTS中检测更多抽象状态-动作对，显著提升样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OGA-UCT算法要求状态-动作对具有相同的即时奖励，这一刚性条件限制了可发现的抽象数量，影响了MCTS的样本效率。

Method: 提出KVDA框架，不再要求价值等价，而是推断状态-动作对之间的价值差异，并基于此构建抽象。将KVDA集成到OGA-UCT中形成KVDA-UCT算法。

Result: KVDA-UCT在多种确定性环境和参数设置下检测到的抽象数量显著多于OGA-UCT，且性能表现更优，无需额外参数。

Conclusion: KVDA框架通过推断价值差异而非要求价值等价，能够发现更多抽象状态-动作对，有效提升了MCTS的样本效率。

Abstract: A core challenge of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is its sample efficiency,
which can be improved by grouping state-action pairs and using their aggregate
statistics instead of single-node statistics. On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT) is the state-of-the-art MCTS
abstraction algorithm for deterministic environments that builds its
abstraction using the Abstractions of State-Action Pairs (ASAP) framework,
which aims to detect states and state-action pairs with the same value under
optimal play by analysing the search graph. ASAP, however, requires two
state-action pairs to have the same immediate reward, which is a rigid
condition that limits the number of abstractions that can be found and thereby
the sample efficiency. In this paper, we break with the paradigm of grouping
value-equivalent states or state-action pairs and instead group states and
state-action pairs with possibly different values as long as the difference
between their values can be inferred. We call this abstraction framework Known
Value Difference Abstractions (KVDA), which infers the value differences by
analysis of the immediate rewards and modifies OGA-UCT to use this framework
instead. The modification is called KVDA-UCT, which detects significantly more
abstractions than OGA-UCT, introduces no additional parameter, and outperforms
OGA-UCT on a variety of deterministic environments and parameter settings.

Conclusion: 智能体AI的未来不在于单一范式的统治，而在于两种范式的有意整合，以创建既适应性强又可靠的系统，为未来研究、开发和政策提供概念工具包。

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a transformative shift in artificial intelligence, but
its rapid advancement has led to a fragmented understanding, often conflating
modern neural systems with outdated symbolic models -- a practice known as
conceptual retrofitting. This survey cuts through this confusion by introducing
a novel dual-paradigm framework that categorizes agentic systems into two
distinct lineages: the Symbolic/Classical (relying on algorithmic planning and
persistent state) and the Neural/Generative (leveraging stochastic generation
and prompt-driven orchestration). Through a systematic PRISMA-based review of
90 studies (2018--2025), we provide a comprehensive analysis structured around
this framework across three dimensions: (1) the theoretical foundations and
architectural principles defining each paradigm; (2) domain-specific
implementations in healthcare, finance, and robotics, demonstrating how
application constraints dictate paradigm selection; and (3) paradigm-specific
ethical and governance challenges, revealing divergent risks and mitigation
strategies. Our analysis reveals that the choice of paradigm is strategic:
symbolic systems dominate safety-critical domains (e.g., healthcare), while
neural systems prevail in adaptive, data-rich environments (e.g., finance).
Furthermore, we identify critical research gaps, including a significant
deficit in governance models for symbolic systems and a pressing need for
hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures. The findings culminate in a strategic
roadmap arguing that the future of Agentic AI lies not in the dominance of one
paradigm, but in their intentional integration to create systems that are both
adaptable and reliable. This work provides the essential conceptual toolkit to
guide future research, development, and policy toward robust and trustworthy
hybrid intelligent systems.

Conclusion: AI对齐工作应更侧重于理解、管理和引导工具性目标，而非试图消除它们，将其导向与人类目标一致的方向。

Abstract: In artificial intelligence (AI) alignment research, instrumental goals, also
called instrumental subgoals or instrumental convergent goals, are widely
associated with advanced AI systems. These goals, which include tendencies such
as power-seeking and self-preservation, become problematic when they conflict
with human aims. Conventional alignment theory treats instrumental goals as
sources of risk that become problematic through failure modes such as reward
hacking or goal misgeneralization, and attempts to limit the symptoms of
instrumental goals, notably resource acquisition and self-preservation. This
article proposes an alternative framing: that a philosophical argument can be
constructed according to which instrumental goals may be understood as features
to be accepted and managed rather than failures to be limited. Drawing on
Aristotle's ontology and its modern interpretations, an ontology of concrete,
goal-directed entities, it argues that advanced AI systems can be seen as
artifacts whose formal and material constitution gives rise to effects distinct
from their designers' intentions. In this view, the instrumental tendencies of
such systems correspond to per se outcomes of their constitution rather than
accidental malfunctions. The implication is that efforts should focus less on
eliminating instrumental goals and more on understanding, managing, and
directing them toward human-aligned ends.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly populating urban areas for
delivery and surveillance purposes. In this work, we develop an optimal
navigation strategy based on Deep Reinforcement Learning. The environment is
represented by a three-dimensional high-fidelity simulation of an urban flow,
characterized by turbulence and recirculation zones. The algorithm presented
here is a flow-aware Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) combined with a Gated
Transformer eXtra Large (GTrXL) architecture, giving the agent richer
information about the turbulent flow field in which it navigates. The results
are compared with a PPO+GTrXL without the secondary prediction tasks, a PPO
combined with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells and a traditional navigation
algorithm. The obtained results show a significant increase in the success rate
(SR) and a lower crash rate (CR) compared to a PPO+LSTM, PPO+GTrXL and the
classical Zermelo's navigation algorithm, paving the way to a completely
reimagined UAV landscape in complex urban environments.

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态执行反馈和多轮推理显著提升了Text-to-SQL任务的性能，证明了集成工具调用和强化学习的有效性

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in Text-to-SQL tasks,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a common method for improving
performance. Existing methods primarily rely on static execution feedback,
which restricts real-time error correction. However, integrating multi-turn
tool invocation along with dynamic feedback could significantly improve
adaptability and robustness, ultimately enhancing model performance. To address
these issues, we propose MTIR-SQL, an innovative Multi-turn Tool-Integrated
Reasoning reinforcement learning framework for Text-to-SQL. Our approach
introduces an execution-aware multi-turn reasoning paradigm that seamlessly
incorporates database execution feedback at each reasoning step, enabling
context-sensitive query generation and progressive refinement throughout the
reasoning process. The framework extends the GRPO algorithm to accommodate
complex multi-turn interaction scenarios. Considering the training instability
characteristics of MTIR and the potential for significant Deviation of model
distribution from the initial model, we enhance the GRPO algorithm by adding a
trajectory filtering mechanism and removing KL loss constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that MTIR-SQL, with 4B parameters, achieves \textbf{64.4}\%
accuracy in the BIRD Dev and 84.6% execution accuracy in the SPIDER Dev,
significantly outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of giving names to predicates in logic
rules using Large Language Models (LLMs). In the context of Inductive Logic
Programming, various rule generation methods produce rules containing unnamed

readability, interpretability, and reusability of the logic theory. Leveraging
recent advancements in LLMs development, we explore their ability to process
natural language and code to provide semantically meaningful suggestions for
giving a name to unnamed predicates. The evaluation of our approach on some
hand-crafted logic rules indicates that LLMs hold potential for this task.

decomposition guided by keyphrase extraction, contextual acronym resolution,
and cross-encoder-based context re-ranking. We evaluate our approach against a
standard RAG baseline using a curated dataset of 85 question--answer--reference
triples derived from an enterprise fintech knowledge base. Experimental results
demonstrate that the agentic RAG system outperforms the baseline in retrieval
precision and relevance, albeit with increased latency. These findings suggest
that structured, multi-agent methodologies offer a promising direction for
enhancing retrieval robustness in complex, domain-specific settings.

Abstract: Zero Reinforcement Learning (Zero-RL) has proven to be an effective approach
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by
directly applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards on pretrained
models, without the need for a supervised fine-tuning phase. However, current
research on zero-RL primarily focuses on domains with easily verifiable reward
signals, such as mathematics, programming, and other reasoning tasks. The
challenge of eliciting reasoning abilities in more diverse scenarios, where
verification is not straightforward, remains underexplored. To address this
gap, we propose a novel zero-RL paradigm designed to improve a model's
reasoning ability across both verifiable and non-verifiable domains. By
combining verifiable rewards with a generative reward model, we conduct
multi-task zero-RL training across both domains, facilitating the transfer of
reasoning capabilities between them. Furthermore, to mitigate reward hacking in
the generative reward model, we design a smooth length penalty that encourages
the generation of more comprehensive thinking tokens in general domains.
Experimental results on Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-14B-Base demonstrate that our
approach achieves superior reasoning performance, not only on tasks requiring
extensive reasoning but also on more general tasks.

TL;DR: 提出MoGE方法，通过生成未充分探索的关键状态和动态一致的转换来增强强化学习中的探索能力


<details>

Motivation: 现有探索方法存在局限性：主动探索在高维环境中效果不佳，被动探索受限于样本多样性不足

Method: MoGE包含两个组件：基于扩散模型的关键状态生成器，以及一步想象世界模型来构建关键转换

Result: 在OpenAI Gym和DeepMind Control Suite上的实验表明，MoGE显著提高了样本效率和性能

Conclusion: MoGE有效连接了探索和策略学习，可在不改变现有算法核心结构的情况下提升探索能力

Abstract: Exploration is fundamental to reinforcement learning (RL), as it determines
how effectively an agent discovers and exploits the underlying structure of its
environment to achieve optimal performance. Existing exploration methods
generally fall into two categories: active exploration and passive exploration.
The former introduces stochasticity into the policy but struggles in
high-dimensional environments, while the latter adaptively prioritizes
transitions in the replay buffer to enhance exploration, yet remains
constrained by limited sample diversity. To address the limitation in passive
exploration, we propose Modelic Generative Exploration (MoGE), which augments
exploration through the generation of under-explored critical states and
synthesis of dynamics-consistent experiences through transition models. MoGE is
composed of two components: (1) a diffusion-based generator that synthesizes
critical states under the guidance of a utility function evaluating each
state's potential influence on policy exploration, and (2) a one-step
imagination world model for constructing critical transitions based on the
critical states for agent learning. Our method adopts a modular formulation
that aligns with the principles of off-policy learning, allowing seamless
integration with existing algorithms to improve exploration without altering
their core structures. Empirical results on OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control
Suite reveal that MoGE effectively bridges exploration and policy learning,
leading to remarkable gains in both sample efficiency and performance across
complex control tasks.

Motivation: 当前精神障碍诊断主要依赖医患对话，这种主观过程导致不同医生和患者之间的诊断存在差异，难以获得可靠结果。需要标准化精神科诊断方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 利用在精神科医患对话数据集上微调的LLMs，通过基于共识的决策过程聚合各模型的诊断预测，并由OpenAI-gpt-oss推理LLM进行精炼。提出部署LLM代理来协调LLM联盟与推理LLM之间的通信。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次将微调LLM联盟与推理LLM集成应用于临床精神健康诊断，为下一代AI驱动的eHealth系统标准化精神科诊断开辟了道路。

Abstract: The diagnosis of most mental disorders, including psychiatric evaluations,
primarily depends on dialogues between psychiatrists and patients. This
subjective process can lead to variability in diagnoses across clinicians and
patients, resulting in inconsistencies and challenges in achieving reliable
outcomes. To address these issues and standardize psychiatric diagnoses, we
propose a Fine-Tuned Large Language Model (LLM) Consortium and OpenAI-gpt-oss
Reasoning LLM-enabled Decision Support System for the clinical diagnosis of
mental disorders. Our approach leverages fine-tuned LLMs trained on
conversational datasets involving psychiatrist-patient interactions focused on
mental health conditions (e.g., depression). The diagnostic predictions from
individual models are aggregated through a consensus-based decision-making
process, refined by the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM. We propose a novel method
for deploying LLM agents that orchestrate communication between the LLM
consortium and the reasoning LLM, ensuring transparency, reliability, and
responsible AI across the entire diagnostic workflow. Experimental results
demonstrate the transformative potential of combining fine-tuned LLMs with a
reasoning model to create a robust and highly accurate diagnostic system for
mental health assessment. A prototype of the proposed platform, integrating
three fine-tuned LLMs with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM, was developed in
collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research Team in Norfolk, Virginia,
USA. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application
of a fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with a reasoning LLM for clinical
mental health diagnosis paving the way for next-generation AI-powered eHealth
systems aimed at standardizing psychiatric diagnoses.

Method: 提出基于反事实分析的智能体影响排序方法(CAIR)，通过反事实分析评估每个智能体对AAW输出的影响程度

Result: 在包含30个用例和230个功能的AAW数据集上评估，CAIR产生一致的排名，优于基线方法，并能增强下游任务的有效性和相关性

Conclusion: CAIR是首个能够评估AAW中智能体影响的方法，提供任务无关的分析，可用于离线和推理时

Abstract: An Agentic AI Workflow (AAW), also known as an LLM-based multi-agent system,
is an autonomous system that assembles several LLM-based agents to work
collaboratively towards a shared goal. The high autonomy, widespread adoption,
and growing interest in such AAWs highlight the need for a deeper understanding
of their operations, from both quality and security aspects. To this day, there
are no existing methods to assess the influence of each agent on the AAW's
final output. Adopting techniques from related fields is not feasible since
existing methods perform only static structural analysis, which is unsuitable
for inference time execution. We present Counterfactual-based Agent Influence
Ranker (CAIR) - the first method for assessing the influence level of each
agent on the AAW's output and determining which agents are the most
influential. By performing counterfactual analysis, CAIR provides a
task-agnostic analysis that can be used both offline and at inference time. We
evaluate CAIR using an AAWs dataset of our creation, containing 30 different
use cases with 230 different functionalities. Our evaluation showed that CAIR
produces consistent rankings, outperforms baseline methods, and can easily
enhance the effectiveness and relevancy of downstream tasks.

TL;DR: ALDEN是一个多轮强化学习框架，通过将视觉语言模型微调为交互式代理，使其能够主动导航长文档。它引入了直接按索引访问页面的fetch操作，并提出视觉语义锚定机制来解决训练不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在处理需要跨多页分析和整合信息的复杂长文档时表现不佳，现有方法依赖固定的推理模板或刚性流程，限制了模型的效率和泛化能力。

Method: ALDEN采用多轮强化学习框架，引入fetch操作直接按索引访问页面，并提出基于规则的跨层级奖励进行密集过程监督。为解决训练不稳定性，提出了视觉语义锚定机制，通过双路径KL散度约束分别稳定视觉和文本表示。

Result: 在三个开源数据集构建的语料库上训练后，ALDEN在五个长文档基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ALDEN标志着从被动文档阅读向能够自主导航和推理长视觉丰富文档的代理迈出了一步，为更准确和高效的长文档理解提供了稳健路径。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at interpreting text-rich images but
struggle with long, visually complex documents that demand analysis and
integration of information spread across multiple pages. Existing approaches
typically rely on fixed reasoning templates or rigid pipelines, which force
VLMs into a passive role and hinder both efficiency and generalization. We
present Active Long-DocumEnt Navigation (ALDEN), a multi-turn reinforcement
learning framework that fine-tunes VLMs as interactive agents capable of
actively navigating long, visually rich documents. ALDEN introduces a novel
fetch action that directly accesses the page by index, complementing the
classic search action and better exploiting document structure. For dense
process supervision and efficient training, we propose a rule-based cross-level
reward that provides both turn- and token-level signals. To address the
empirically observed training instability caused by numerous visual tokens from
long documents, we further propose a visual-semantic anchoring mechanism that
applies a dual-path KL-divergence constraint to stabilize visual and textual
representations separately during training. Trained on a corpus constructed
from three open-source datasets, ALDEN achieves state-of-the-art performance on
five long-document benchmarks. Overall, ALDEN marks a step beyond passive
document reading toward agents that autonomously navigate and reason across
long, visually rich documents, offering a robust path to more accurate and
efficient long-document understanding.

Method: 提出BambooKG知识图谱，在非三元组边上添加基于频率的权重，体现链接强度，借鉴赫布原理。

Result: 减少了信息损失，在单跳和多跳推理任务上表现优于现有解决方案。

Conclusion: BambooKG通过带权重的知识图谱结构有效提升了推理能力，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation allows LLMs to access external knowledge,
reducing hallucinations and ageing-data issues. However, it treats retrieved
chunks independently and struggles with multi-hop or relational reasoning,
especially across documents. Knowledge graphs enhance this by capturing the
relationships between entities using triplets, enabling structured, multi-chunk
reasoning. However, these tend to miss information that fails to conform to the
triplet structure. We introduce BambooKG, a knowledge graph with
frequency-based weights on non-triplet edges which reflect link strength,
drawing on the Hebbian principle of "fire together, wire together". This
decreases information loss and results in improved performance on single- and
multi-hop reasoning, outperforming the existing solutions.

TL;DR: TheraMind是一个用于纵向心理咨询的战略性和适应性代理，采用新颖的双循环架构，将复杂的咨询过程解耦为会话内循环和跨会话循环，以解决现有方法在情感理解、适应性策略和多会话治疗方面的不足。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的心理咨询大语言模型方法缺乏情感理解、适应性策略以及跨多会话的治疗方法使用，与真实临床实践相去甚远。

Method: 提出TheraMind代理，采用双循环架构：会话内循环用于战术对话管理，感知患者情绪状态并动态选择响应策略；跨会话循环用于战略治疗规划，评估治疗效果并调整后续交互方法。

Result: 在高保真模拟环境中的广泛评估显示，TheraMind在多会话指标（如连贯性、灵活性和治疗协调性）上优于其他方法，验证了其双循环设计在模拟战略性、适应性和纵向治疗行为方面的有效性。

Conclusion: TheraMind的双循环架构有效解决了现有心理咨询LLM的关键缺陷，在模拟环境中展现出卓越的多会话表现，为更接近真实临床实践的心理咨询代理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) in psychological counseling have attracted
increasing attention. However, existing approaches often lack emotional
understanding, adaptive strategies, and the use of therapeutic methods across
multiple sessions with long-term memory, leaving them far from real clinical
practice. To address these critical gaps, we introduce TheraMind, a strategic
and adaptive agent for longitudinal psychological counseling. The cornerstone
of TheraMind is a novel dual-loop architecture that decouples the complex
counseling process into an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management
and a Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning. The Intra-Session
Loop perceives the patient's emotional state to dynamically select response
strategies while leveraging cross-session memory to ensure continuity.
Crucially, the Cross-Session Loop empowers the agent with long-term
adaptability by evaluating the efficacy of the applied therapy after each
session and adjusting the method for subsequent interactions. We validate our
approach in a high-fidelity simulation environment grounded in real clinical
cases. Extensive evaluations show that TheraMind outperforms other methods,
especially on multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and
Therapeutic Attunement, validating the effectiveness of its dual-loop design in
emulating strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior. The code
is publicly available at https://0mwwm0.github.io/TheraMind/.

Motivation: 尽管有大量实验证据表明Hagen Poiseuille流中存在湍流，但线性稳定性分析尚未证实其不稳定性。挑战在于管道中心1/r项引入的奇点，这使传统稳定性方法复杂化。

Method: 采用无网格框架进行全局稳定性分析，避免了传统方法中的奇点问题。

Result: 虽然未恢复预期的不稳定模态，但发现了一组新的模态，这些模态与局部稳定性分析中观察到的模态具有不同特征，并证明了全局方法在捕获局部化不稳定性方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 全局稳定性分析方法能够有效捕获局部化不稳定性，无需进行多次模拟，为研究Hagen Poiseuille流的不稳定性提供了新途径。

Abstract: Despite extensive experimental evidence of turbulence in Hagen Poiseuille
flow, linear stability analysis has not yet confirmed its instability. One
challenge is the singularity introduced by the term 1/r in the center of the
pipe, which complicates traditional stability approaches. In this study, we
explore a global stability analysis using a meshless framework. Although this
approach did not recover the expected unstable modes, it revealed a new set of
modes with distinct characteristics from those observed in local stability
analysis. We analyze these modes and their impact on transient energy growth,
demonstrating the effectiveness of the global approach in capturing localized
instabilities without requiring multiple simulations.

Motivation: 传统模拟需要解析上游物体几何形状，计算成本高。本研究旨在开发一种无需上游物体的简化模拟方法，降低计算复杂度。

Method: 在矩形域中求解不可压缩Navier-Stokes方程，入流边界条件使用实验测量或直接数值模拟获得的相位平均或时间平均速度剖面。

Result: 在Re=500和5,000两种雷诺数下，成功重建了包括相干涡脱落、雷诺应力分布和频谱内容在内的完整尾流，与完整物体DNS和实验结果吻合良好。

Conclusion: 钝体尾流的基本动力学由近尾流剖面的不稳定性诱导，无需显式包含钝体。该方法将DNS计算成本降低一个数量级，为湍流分离流的简化建模和控制提供了新途径。

Abstract: We present a simplified framework for simulating three-dimensional turbulent
wakes without the upstream body that generates them. Instead of resolving the
geometry, the incompressible Navier Stokes equations are solved in a
rectangular domain on which the inflow boundary condition is prescribed as
either phase-averaged or time-averaged velocity profiles obtained from
experimental measurements and direct numerical simulations. Remarkably,
prescribing the inflow at a single downstream location is sufficient to
reconstruct the entire wake, including coherent vortex shedding,
Reynolds-stress distributions, and spectral content, for the two Reynolds
numbers we investigate here: Re=500 and 5,000. Comparisons with corresponding
full-body DNS and experiments show good agreement in mean velocity fields and
turbulence statistics. Our results demonstrate that the essential dynamics of
bluff-body wakes are induced by the instability of the near-wake profile, and
do not require the explicit presence of the bluff body. This body-free
simulation paradigm enables physically interpretable wake reconstruction from
mean profiles that can be easily obtained from measurements or simple 2D
simulations. Our approach reduces the computational cost of DNS by an order of
magnitude, hence offering a new route for reduced-complexity modeling and
control of turbulent separated flows.

Abstract: The interaction of 'walking droplets' and capillary waves in a weakly
subcritical Faraday wave experiment has been studied as a hydrodynamic analog
to Bohmian quantum mechanics (see "Hydrodynamic Quantum Analogs", J. Bush and
A. Oza, Rep. Prog. Physics (2021)). We report here experimental results of
walking droplets interacting with supercritical Faraday waves with
dimensionless acceleration of approximately 8.4, where the onset of Faraday
instability occurs at dimensionless acceleration 6.3, in flat bath topography.
Our working fluid is silicone oil with a kinematic viscosity of 20 cst that is
placed as a 4.2 mm horizontal liquid layer in an intermediate-aspect-ratio
circular bath with a radius to Faraday wavelength ratio of 5.8. We also use
different 3D-printed subsurfaces that act as slit structures with local oil
depth of 0.7 mm. We confirm expected behavior for walking droplets in the
supercritical Faraday regime, such as erratic trajectories, droplets clustering
together due to capillary effects, and spontaneous drop creation. We note a
special case of walking-droplet behavior when the bath only partially displays
Faraday waves. We discuss the influence of the lateral boundaries and slits on
droplet trajectory in this chaotic regime and compare the measured trajectories
found here to those single and double slit experiments previously studied in
the subcritical Faraday regime.

Abstract: The influence of flow non-uniformity and unsteadiness on premixed flames is
of considerable interest due to its direct relevance to practical combustion
systems. The steady counterflow flame has long served as a canonical
configuration for investigating flame dynamics under controlled, spatially
non-uniform conditions. A commonly studied variation, referred to as the
unsteady counterflow, introduces a controlled temporal perturbation to the
otherwise steady flow from the nozzles, thereby enabling the systematic
examination of the coupled effects of unsteadiness and non-uniformity. Prior
investigations have focused on flame dynamics along the line of symmetry, where
the reduced dimensionality of the problem facilitates analysis. In the present
study, we extend this perspective by experimentally examining flame behavior at
off-center locations, where multi-dimensional effects of non-uniformity and
unsteadiness are more pronounced. Results reveal markedly different dynamics
away from the centerline, characterized by a dominant contribution from higher
harmonic responses. Further analysis of the associated vortex dynamics in the
shear layer demonstrates that the intensity of these vortical structures
directly governs the strength of the observed higher harmonics, and thereby the
altered flame behavior.

Conclusion: 研究为在湍流压缩和重建中使用CNF时选择条件机制、容量和域分解提供了严格的物理感知基础，表明不同CNF变体在不同应用场景下各有优势。

Abstract: We investigate conditional neural fields (CNFs), mesh-agnostic,
coordinate-based decoders conditioned on a low-dimensional latent, for spatial
dimensionality reduction of turbulent flows. CNFs are benchmarked against
Proper Orthogonal Decomposition and a convolutional autoencoder within a
unified encoding-decoding framework and a common evaluation protocol that
explicitly separates in-range (interpolative) from out-of-range (strict
extrapolative) testing beyond the training horizon, with identical
preprocessing, metrics, and fixed splits across all baselines. We examine three
conditioning mechanisms: (i) activation-only modulation (often termed FiLM),
(ii) low-rank weight and bias modulation (termed FP), and (iii) last-layer
inner-product coupling, and introduce a novel domain-decomposed CNF that
localizes complexities. Across representative turbulence datasets (WMLES
channel inflow, DNS channel inflow, and wall pressure fluctuations over
turbulent boundary layers), CNF-FP achieves the lowest training and in-range
testing errors, while CNF-FiLM generalizes best for out-of-range scenarios once
moderate latent capacity is available. Domain decomposition significantly
improves out-of-range accuracy, especially for the more demanding datasets. The
study provides a rigorous, physics-aware basis for selecting conditioning,
capacity, and domain decomposition when using CNFs for turbulence compression
and reconstruction.

Motivation: 腔流中的自持振荡虽然能增强流体混合和能量传输，但会放大声学载荷，可能损坏周围结构，因此需要开发调控振荡而不影响性能的策略。

Method: 使用OpenFOAM进行大涡模拟(LES)，通过谱分析方法分析非定常压力信号，结合密度梯度、涡量场、归一化声阻抗和全局小波功率揭示抑制机制。

Result: 马赫数2时后壁子腔通过夹带质量和破坏对流反馈环最有效；马赫数3时前壁子腔通过削弱前缘附近的流体-声学耦合和破坏压缩性驱动反馈更有效。

Conclusion: 不同马赫数下最优的子腔位置不同，子腔能有效抑制腔流自持振荡的主导频率，为调控振荡提供了有效策略。

Abstract: The self-sustaining oscillations in cavity flows enhance fluid mixing and
promote energy and momentum transport. However, the associated oscillation
frequencies can amplify acoustic loading, potentially damaging surrounding
structures. Hence, understanding cavity dynamics across geometries and
freestream conditions and developing strategies to regulate these oscillations
without compromising performance are essential. This study examines the
influence of sub-cavities placed at the front and aft walls of a cavity
confined by a top wall with a deflection angle of 2.29 degrees, under
freestream Mach numbers 2 and 3. Large eddy simulations (LES) are performed
using OpenFOAM, and unsteady pressure signals are analyzed through spectral
methods. Results show that the aft-wall sub-cavity most effectively suppresses
the dominant oscillation at Mach number 2, while the front-wall sub-cavity
achieves greater suppression at Mach number 3. Density gradient (numerical
Schlieren) and vorticity fields, normalized acoustic impedance, and global
wavelet power reveal the mechanisms responsible for this attenuation. At Mach
number 2, the aft-wall sub-cavity entrains mass and disrupts the convective
feedback loop. At Mach number 3, the front-wall sub-cavity weakens the
hydrodynamic-acoustic coupling near the leading edge, disrupting the
compressibility-driven feedback. These configurations suppress dominant
frequencies by 5.45 and 23.4 percent for Mach numbers 2 and 3, respectively.
Cross-correlation between pressure probes and Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD)

Result: 数值实验显示，在溃坝波与平滑波碰撞场景中，自适应方法能获得准确结果，同时比固定复杂度模型提速高达60%。

Conclusion: 浅水矩方程非常适合自适应模拟，所提出的方法能有效平衡计算精度和效率，为复杂流动模拟提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Shallow free surface flows are often characterized by both subdomains that
require high modeling complexity and subdomains that can be sufficiently
accurately modeled with low modeling complexity. Moreover, these subdomains may
change in time as the water flows through the domain. This motivates the need
for space and time adaptivity in the simulation of shallow free surface flows.
In this paper, we develop the first adaptive simulations using the recently
developed Shallow Water Moment Equations, which are an extension of the
standard Shallow Water Equations that allow for vertically changing velocity
profiles by including additional variables and equations. The model-specific
modeling complexity of a shallow water moment model is determined by its order.
The higher the order of the model, the more variables and equations are
included in the model. Shallow water moment models are ideally suited for
adaptivity because they are hierarchical such that low-order models and
high-order models share the same structure. To enable adaptive simulations, we
propose two approaches for the coupling of the varying-order shallow water
moment equations at their boundary interfaces. The first approach dynamically
updates padded state variables but cannot be written in conservative form,
while the second approach uses fixed padded state variable values of zero and
reduces to conservative form for conservative moment equations. The switching
procedure between high-order models and low-order models is based on a new set
of model error estimators, originating from a decomposition of the high-order
models. Numerical results of the collision of a dam-break wave with a smooth
wave yield accurate results, while achieving speedups up to 60 percent compared
to a non-adaptive model with fixed modeling complexity.

TL;DR: 本研究首次在自由演化旋转湍流中观测到弱波湍流理论预测的惯性波能量谱，验证了该理论在特定参数范围内的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旋转湍流对生活有重要影响但理解不足，Galtier 20多年前通过弱波湍流理论预测了旋转湍流的能量谱，但该谱在自由演化流中从未被观测到。

Method: 从稳态旋转湍流速度场中移除准二维湍流分量，分析剩余三维场中的惯性波是否遵循弱波湍流理论预测。

Result: 研究发现剩余三维场确实由惯性波组成，并精确遵循弱波湍流理论预测，验证了能量谱对所有四个相关参数的依赖性。

Conclusion: 结果为研究准二维场与惯性波场的共存及其相互作用提供了坚实基础，推动了新的理论和实验工作。

Abstract: Though highly impacting our lives, rotating turbulent flows are not well
understood. These anisotropic three-dimensional disordered flows are governed
by different nonlinear processes, each of which can be dominant in a different
range of parameters. More than 20 years ago, Galtier used weak wave turbulence
theory (WTT) to derive explicit predictions for the energy spectrum of rotating
turbulence. The spectrum is an outcome of forward energy transfer by inertial
waves, the linear modes of rotating fluid systems. This spectrum has not yet
been observed in freely evolving flows. In this work, we show that the
predicted WTT field does exist in steady rotating turbulence, alongside with
the more energetic quasi two-dimensional turbulent field. By removing the 2D
component from the steady state velocity field, we show that the remainder
three-dimensional field consists of inertial waves and exactly obeys WTT
predictions. Our analysis verifies the dependence of the energy spectrum on all
four relevant parameters and provides limits, beyond which WTT predictions
fail. These results provide a solid basis for new theoretical and experimental
works focused on the coexistence of the quasi 2D field and the inertial waves
field and on their interactions.

TL;DR: 实验研究了表面活性剂吸附动力学对界面快速形成过程中空腔动力学的影响，发现吸附动力学速率不同的表面活性剂对空腔动态行为有显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究表面活性剂吸附动力学在快速界面形成过程中对空腔动态行为的影响，特别关注不同吸附速率的表面活性剂如何动态降低表面张力。

Method: 使用亚毫米射流冲击表面活性剂溶液池，观察空腔收缩和闭合的亚毫秒级过程，比较SDS（中等吸附速率）和Surfynol 465（超快吸附速率）的效果。

Result: SDS对空腔坍塌路径影响很小，与纯水类似；而Surfynol 465能产生更深、持续时间更长的空腔。谐振子模型能准确描述深密封状态下的空腔收缩，拟合的阻尼比与动态表面张力一致。

Conclusion: 表面活性剂的吸附动力学速率是决定其能否在快速界面形成过程中有效降低动态表面张力的关键因素，超快吸附的表面活性剂能显著改变空腔动力学行为。

Abstract: We experimentally investigate the influence of surfactant adsorption kinetics
on cavity dynamics during the rapid formation of interfaces. For this purpose,
we use a submillimeter jet impacting onto a surfactant-laden liquid pool much
larger than the jet dimensions. Cavity retraction and closure occur on a
submillisecond timescale, posing a stringent test of the ability of surfactants
to reduce surface tension dynamically. Our experiments reveal the difference
between the effects of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), a surfactant with
moderately fast adsorption kinetics, and Surfynol 465, a surfactant with
ultrafast adsorption kinetics. For SDS, the collapse pathway is nearly
indistinguishable from that of pure water, suggesting negligible dynamic
surface tension reduction. In contrast, Surfynol allows the emergence of deeper
cavities that persist longer in the liquid pool. The harmonic oscillator model
accurately captures the cavity retraction in the deep seal regime. The fitted
values of the damping ratios are consistent with the dynamic surface tensions.

Abstract: Ammonia (NH3) is a zero-carbon fuel that has been receiving increasing
attention for power generation and even transportation. Compared to H2, NH3's
volumetric energy density is higher, is not as explosive, and has well
established transport and storage technologies. Yet, NH3 has poor flammability
and flame stability characteristics and more reactive nitrogen (RN: NOx, N2O)
emissions than hydrocarbon fuels, at least with traditional combustion
processes. Partially cracking NH3 (into a NH3-H2-N2 mixture, AHN) addresses its
flammability and stability issues. RN emissions remain a challenge, and
mechanisms of their emissions are fundamentally different in NH3 and
hydrocarbon combustion. While rich-quench-lean NH3 combustion strategies have
shown promise, the largest contributions to RN emissions are the unrelaxed
emissions in the fuel-rich stage due to overshoot of thermodynamic equilibrium
within the reaction zone of premixed flames coupled with finite residence times
available for relaxation to equilibrium. This work introduces a
rush-to-equilibrium concept for AHN combustion, which aims to reduce the
unrelaxed RN emissions in finite residence times by accelerating the approach
to equilibrium. In the concept, a flow particle is subjected to a decaying
mixing rate as it transits the premixed flame. This mitigates the mixing
effects that prevents the particle approach to equilibrium, and promotes the
chemistry effects to push the particle toward equilibrium, all while
considering finite residence times. Evaluated with a state-of-the-art
combustion model at gas turbine conditions, the concept shows the potential to
reduce RN emissions by an order of magnitude, and that works irrespective of
cracking extent, pressure, temperature, etc. A brief discussion of possible
practical implementation reveals reasonable geometric and flow parameters
characteristic of modern gas turbine combustors.

Motivation: 为了加速数值模拟并高效生成新数据，需要开发能够处理不同流动条件、提高空间分辨率并预测时间演化的鲁棒框架。

Method: 基于高阶奇异值分解与机器学习和深度学习技术开发降阶模型，通过30个二维层流模拟验证性能。

Conclusion: HybriNet框架在流体动力学模拟中表现出色，能够有效加速计算并生成高质量数据。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce HybriNet an innovative and robust framework
capable of enhancing spatial resolution, generating fluid dynamics databases
for specific flow parameters, and predicting their temporal evolution. The
methodology is based on the development of a reduced-order model (ROM) by
integrating high-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) with machine
learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. The ROM enables the generation
of multi-parametric fluid dynamics databases concerning varying flow
conditions, increases the spatial resolution, and predicts the behaviour of the
fluid dynamics problem in terms of time. This helps to accelerate numerical
simulations and generate new data efficiently. The performance of the proposed
approach has been validated using a collection of 30 two-dimensional laminar
flow simulations over a square cylinder at different Reynolds numbers and
angles of attack. The databases reconstructed using the proposed methodology
exhibited a relative root mean square error below 2% when compared to
ground-truth high-resolution data, demonstrating the robustness, accuracy, and
efficiency of the proposed framework.

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: 本文研究了毛细管异质性对含水层中气体运移和捕获的影响，发现接触角的空间变异性会改变毛细管进入压力和运移路径，从而影响甲烷的行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毛细管异质性被认为是含水层和储层中气体羽流运移和捕获的一阶控制因素，但空间变异性在接触角方面的作用尚未充分研究。

Method: 使用分子动力学模拟估算石英和高岭石在不同盐度条件下的接触角，并通过接触角修正的Leverett J函数将这些结果整合到连续尺度多相流模拟中。

Result: 考虑接触角异质性后，含水层中流动和残余捕获的甲烷减少高达10%，而向大气泄漏的甲烷增加多达20%。这种效应的程度取决于渗透率对比、泄漏速率、盐度和相比例。

Conclusion: 这种跨尺度框架通过将分子尺度的润湿性与连续尺度的流动和输运耦合，为地下水保护和风险评估提供了物理基础，并可推广到其他地下气体输运问题。

Abstract: Capillary heterogeneity is increasingly recognized as a first-order control
on gas plume migration and trapping in aquifers and storage formations. We show
that spatial variability in the water-methane contact angle, determined by
mineralogy and salinity, alters capillary entry pressures and migration
pathways. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we estimate contact angles on
quartz and kaolinite under fresh and saline conditions and incorporate these
results into continuum-scale multiphase flow simulations via a
contact-angle-informed Leverett J function, mapping wettability directly onto
continuum-scale flow properties. Accounting for contact angle heterogeneity
affects methane behavior: mobile and residually trapped methane in aquifers
decrease by up to 10 percent, while leakage to the atmosphere increases by as
much as 20 percent. The magnitude of this effect depends on permeability
contrast, leakage rate, salinity, and facies proportions. By coupling
molecular-scale wettability to continuum-scale flow and transport, this
cross-scale framework provides a physically grounded basis for groundwater
protection and risk assessment and yields more reliable emissions estimates.
The approach can be generalized to other subsurface gas transport problems,
including hydrogen and carbon dioxide storage, as well as natural releases such
as methane from permafrost thaw.

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: 该研究提出了三种改进SPHinXsys中基于缓冲区的开放边界条件的方法，以增强其在强回流和多开放边界流动中的一致性、独立性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在粒子框架中有效处理具有强回流和多个开放边界的流动，需要改进现有开放边界条件的性能。

Method: 引入连续介质假设防止过度粒子添加，通过区域约束和独立标记方案增强双向缓冲区的独立性，将压力边界条件从零阶一致性升级为一阶一致性。

Result: 在四种测试案例中成功验证了改进效果，包括在强回流条件下成功模拟湍流平面射流。

Conclusion: 三种改进只需对代码框架进行微小修改，但能带来显著的性能提升，特别是在处理复杂开放边界流动时表现优异。

Abstract: To effectively handle flows characterized by strong backflow and multiple
open boundaries within particle-based frameworks, this study introduces three
enhancements to improve the consistency, independence, and accuracy of the
buffer-based open boundary condition in SPHinXsys. First, to improve the buffer
consistency, the continuum hypothesis is introduced to prevent the excessive
particle addition induced by strong backflow. Secondly, the independence of the
bidirectional buffer is enhanced through region-constrained and independent
labeling schemes, which effectively eliminate buffer interference and erroneous
particle deletion in complex open-boundary flows. Thirdly, the original
zeroth-order consistent pressure boundary condition is upgraded to first-order
consistency by introducing a mirror boundary treatment for the correction
matrix. The implementation is based on the rigorously validated weakly
compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics coupled with Reynolds-averaged
Navier-Stokes (WCSPH-RANS) method, and both laminar and turbulent flow
simulations are performed. Four test cases, including straight and U-shaped
channel flows, a plane jet, and the flow in a 3D self-rotational micro-mixer,
are conducted to comprehensively validate the proposed improvements. Among
these cases, the turbulent plane jet is successfully simulated at a moderate
resolution within a very compact computational domain involving strong
backflow, a condition that is usually challenging for mesh-based methods. The
three improvements require only minor modifications to the code framework, yet
they yield significant performance gains.

TL;DR: 本文研究了水面油膜中微生物群落作为活性地毯的流体动力学特性，发现当油膜厚度与菌落尺寸达到特定比例时，能通过三维涡环状流动模式最优地增强粒子向菌落边缘的传输。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水面油膜作为富含表面活性剂和微生物的薄层环境，其几何约束如何影响流体流动和物质传输尚不明确，特别是油膜厚度与微生物菌落尺寸的相对关系对传输效率的影响。

Method: 结合解析和数值方法，将微生物群落建模为施加偶极力场的二维活性地毯分布，分析不同几何约束条件下的流体动力学行为。

Result: 发现存在一个最优的油膜厚度与菌落尺寸比例，能够通过三维涡环状流动模式显著增强粒子向菌落边缘的平流传输，涡环特征长度与约束高度相当。

Conclusion: 几何约束比例（油膜厚度与菌落尺寸之比）单独就能产生有限、相干的涡环状结构，这揭示了集体活动与非平衡传输之间的相互作用，解释了微生物群落在表面油膜等几何约束环境中形成、扩散和持续存在的机制。

Abstract: Slicks are thin viscous films that can be found at the air--water interface
of water bodies such as lakes, rivers and oceans. These micro-layers are
enriched in surfactants, organic matter, and microorganisms, and exhibit steep
physical and chemical gradients across only tens to hundreds of micrometers. In
such geometrically confined environments, the hydrodynamics and transport of
nutrients, pollutants, and microorganisms are constrained, yet they
collectively sustain key biogenic processes. It remains however largely
unexplored how the hydrodynamic flows and transport are affected by the
vertical extent of slicks relative to the size of microbial colonies. Here, we
study this question by combining analytical and numerical approaches to model a
microbial colony as an active carpet: a two-dimensional distribution of
micro-swimmers exerting dipolar forces. We show that there exists a ratio
between the carpet size and the confinement height that is optimal for the
enhancement of particle transport toward the colony edges through advective
flows that recirculate in 3D vortex-ring-like patterns with a characteristic
length comparable to the confinement height. Our results demonstrate that
finite, coherent vortex-ring-like structures can arise solely from the
geometrical confinement ratio of slick thickness to microbial colony size.
These findings shed light on the interplay between collective activity and
out-of-equilibrium transport, and on how microbial communities form, spread,
and persist in geometrically constrained environments such as surface slicks.

Abstract: As centralized AI hits compute ceilings and diminishing returns from
ever-larger training runs, meeting demand requires an inference layer that
scales horizontally in both capacity and capability. We present Fortytwo, a
novel protocol that leverages swarm intelligence principles and distributed
pairwise ranking consensus to achieve superior performance in AI inference. Our
approach reimagines collaboration among AI nodes using swarm inference: a
peer-ranked, reputation-weighted consensus across heterogeneous models that
surfaces the highest-quality responses. Using pairwise ranking with a custom
Bradley-Terry-style aggregation model, we demonstrate that swarm inference
substantially outperforms majority voting, achieving 85.90% on GPQA Diamond
versus 68.69% for majority voting with the same model set - an improvement of
+17.21 percentage points (approximately +25.1% relative). The protocol
incorporates on-chain reputation so node influence adapts to demonstrated
accuracy over time, yielding a meritocratic consensus that filters low-quality
or malicious participants. To resist Sybil attacks, Fortytwo employs
proof-of-capability in its consensus: nodes must successfully complete
calibration/test requests and stake reputation to enter ranking rounds, making
multi-identity attacks economically unattractive while preserving openness.
Across six challenging benchmarks, including GPQA Diamond, LiveCodeBench, and
AIME, our evaluation indicates higher accuracy and strong resilience to
adversarial and noisy free-form prompting (e.g., prompt-injection degradation
of only 0.12% versus 6.20% for a monolithic single-model baseline), while
retaining practical deployability. Together, these results establish a
foundation for decentralized AI systems - democratizing access to high-quality
inference through collective intelligence without sacrificing reliability or
security.

Conclusion: 弱到强泛化在不同数据机制下呈现不同模式，需要根据数据特征优化训练策略以避免过度训练带来的性能退化。

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization refers to the phenomenon where a stronger model
trained under supervision from a weaker one can outperform its teacher. While
prior studies aim to explain this effect, most theoretical insights are limited
to abstract frameworks or linear/random feature models. In this paper, we
provide a formal analysis of weak-to-strong generalization from a linear CNN
(weak) to a two-layer ReLU CNN (strong). We consider structured data composed
of label-dependent signals of varying difficulty and label-independent noise,
and analyze gradient descent dynamics when the strong model is trained on data
labeled by the pretrained weak model. Our analysis identifies two regimes --
data-scarce and data-abundant -- based on the signal-to-noise characteristics
of the dataset, and reveals distinct mechanisms of weak-to-strong
generalization. In the data-scarce regime, generalization occurs via benign
overfitting or fails via harmful overfitting, depending on the amount of data,
and we characterize the transition boundary. In the data-abundant regime,
generalization emerges in the early phase through label correction, but we
observe that overtraining can subsequently degrade performance.

Abstract: Machine learning models increasingly map biological sequence-fitness
landscapes to predict mutational effects. Effective evaluation of these models
requires benchmarks curated from empirical data. Despite their impressive
scales, existing benchmarks lack topographical information regarding the
underlying fitness landscapes, which hampers interpretation and comparison of
model performance beyond averaged scores. Here, we introduce GraphFLA, a Python
framework that constructs and analyzes fitness landscapes from mutagensis data
in diverse modalities (e.g., DNA, RNA, protein, and beyond) with up to millions
of mutants. GraphFLA calculates 20 biologically relevant features that
characterize 4 fundamental aspects of landscape topography. By applying
GraphFLA to over 5,300 landscapes from ProteinGym, RNAGym, and CIS-BP, we
demonstrate its utility in interpreting and comparing the performance of dozens
of fitness prediction models, highlighting factors influencing model accuracy
and respective advantages of different models. In addition, we release 155
combinatorially complete empirical fitness landscapes, encompassing over 2.2
million sequences across various modalities. All the codes and datasets are

Abstract: The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence
offers significant opportunities to enhance our ability to monitor and address
ecological changes. As environmental challenges become increasingly pressing,
the need for effective remote monitoring solutions is more critical than ever.
A major challenge in designing IoT applications for environmental monitoring -
particularly those involving image data - is to create energy-efficient IoT
devices capable of long-term operation in remote areas with limited power
availability. Advancements in the field of Tiny Machine Learning allow the use
of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on resource-constrained,
battery-operated microcontrollers. Since data transfer is energy-intensive,
performing inference directly on microcontrollers to reduce the message size
can extend the operational lifespan of IoT nodes. This work evaluates the use
of common Low Power Wide Area Networks and compressed CNNs trained on domain
specific datasets on an ESP32-S3. Our experiments demonstrate, among other
things, that executing CNN inference on-device and transmitting only the
results reduces the overall energy consumption by a factor of up to five
compared to sending raw image data. %The compression of the model using Post
Training Quantization is accompanied by an acceptable reduction in accuracy of
only a few percentage points compared to a non-quantized model. These findings
advocate the development of IoT applications with reduced carbon footprint and
capable of operating autonomously in environmental monitoring scenarios by
incorporating Embedded Machine Learning.

Method: 开发了基于梯度的OODSelect方法，用于识别语义一致的OOD子集，在这些子集中ID和OOD准确率的相关性会反转。

Result: 在广泛使用的分布偏移基准中，OODSelect发现了占标准OOD集一半以上的子集，其中更高的ID准确率预测更低的OOD准确率。

Conclusion: 聚合指标可能掩盖OOD鲁棒性的重要失败模式，需要更细粒度的分析来理解模型在特定语义子集上的表现。

Abstract: Benchmarks for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization frequently show a
strong positive correlation between in-distribution (ID) and OOD accuracy
across models, termed "accuracy-on-the-line." This pattern is often taken to
imply that spurious correlations - correlations that improve ID but reduce OOD
performance - are rare in practice. We find that this positive correlation is
often an artifact of aggregating heterogeneous OOD examples. Using a simple
gradient-based method, OODSelect, we identify semantically coherent OOD subsets
where accuracy on the line does not hold. Across widely used distribution shift
benchmarks, the OODSelect uncovers subsets, sometimes over half of the standard
OOD set, where higher ID accuracy predicts lower OOD accuracy. Our findings
indicate that aggregate metrics can obscure important failure modes of OOD
robustness. We release code and the identified subsets to facilitate further
research.

*Shakeel Abdulkareem,Bora Yimenicioglu,Andrea Yang,Khartik Uppalapati,Aneesh Gudipati,Zhaoyang Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 开发了一种自适应多任务EEG分类器，使用GRU-TCN网络和深度Q网络实时调整决策阈值，用于快速分类中风类型、严重程度和半球偏侧化，在UCLH数据集上达到98.0%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速分诊疑似中风需要准确、床旁可部署的工具；EEG有潜力但在初次接触时使用不足。

Method: 将32通道EEG信号转换为功率谱密度特征，使用循环卷积网络(GRU-TCN)预测中风类型、半球偏侧化和严重程度，并应用深度Q网络(DQN)实时调整决策阈值。

Result: 基线GRU-TCN在中风类型分类上达到89.3%准确率(F1 92.8%)，严重程度96.9%(F1 95.9%)，偏侧化96.7%(F1 97.4%)；使用DQN阈值自适应后，中风类型准确率提升至98.0%(F1 97.7%)。

Conclusion: 自适应阈值调整将操作点转移到临床偏好的敏感度-特异性权衡，同时集成的头皮图和频谱可视化支持可解释性。

Abstract: Rapid triage of suspected stroke needs accurate, bedside-deployable tools;
EEG is promising but underused at first contact. We present an adaptive
multitask EEG classifier that converts 32-channel signals to power spectral
density features (Welch), uses a recurrent-convolutional network (GRU-TCN) to
predict stroke type (healthy, ischemic, hemorrhagic), hemispheric
lateralization, and severity, and applies a deep Q-network (DQN) to tune
decision thresholds in real time. Using a patient-wise split of the UCLH Stroke
EIT/EEG data set (44 recordings; about 26 acute stroke, 10 controls), the
primary outcome was stroke-type performance; secondary outcomes were severity
and lateralization. The baseline GRU-TCN reached 89.3% accuracy (F1 92.8%) for
stroke type, about 96.9% (F1 95.9%) for severity, and about 96.7% (F1 97.4%)
for lateralization. With DQN threshold adaptation, stroke-type accuracy
increased to about 98.0% (F1 97.7%). We also tested robustness on an
independent, low-density EEG cohort (ZJU4H) and report paired patient-level
statistics. Analyses follow STARD 2015 guidance for diagnostic accuracy studies
(index test: GRU-TCN+DQN; reference standard: radiology/clinical diagnosis;
patient-wise evaluation). Adaptive thresholding shifts the operating point to
clinically preferred sensitivity-specificity trade-offs, while integrated
scalp-map and spectral visualizations support interpretability.

*Biyi Fang,Kripa Rajshekhar,Truong Vo,Diego Klabjan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了nnLDA，一种神经增强的概率主题模型，通过神经先验机制动态整合辅助信息，解决了传统主题模型难以整合元数据等辅助信息的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题模型如LDA在整合元数据、用户属性或文档标签等辅助信息方面存在困难，这限制了其表达能力、个性化和可解释性。

Method: nnLDA将每个文档建模为潜在主题的混合，其中主题比例的先验由基于辅助特征的神经网络生成，并使用随机变分EM算法联合优化神经和概率组件。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，nnLDA在主题一致性、困惑度和下游分类任务上持续优于LDA和Dirichlet-Multinomial回归。

Conclusion: 结果表明，在存在辅助信息的情况下，将神经表示学习与概率主题建模相结合具有显著优势。

Abstract: Traditional topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have been
widely used to uncover latent structures in text corpora, but they often
struggle to integrate auxiliary information such as metadata, user attributes,
or document labels. These limitations restrict their expressiveness,
personalization, and interpretability. To address this, we propose nnLDA, a
neural-augmented probabilistic topic model that dynamically incorporates side
information through a neural prior mechanism. nnLDA models each document as a
mixture of latent topics, where the prior over topic proportions is generated
by a neural network conditioned on auxiliary features. This design allows the
model to capture complex nonlinear interactions between side information and
topic distributions that static Dirichlet priors cannot represent. We develop a
stochastic variational Expectation-Maximization algorithm to jointly optimize
the neural and probabilistic components. Across multiple benchmark datasets,
nnLDA consistently outperforms LDA and Dirichlet-Multinomial Regression in
topic coherence, perplexity, and downstream classification. These results
highlight the benefits of combining neural representation learning with
probabilistic topic modeling in settings where side information is available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KAN-GCN是一种用于冰盖建模的快速准确模拟器，通过将Kolmogorov-Arnold网络作为特征校准器置于图卷积网络之前，提高了特征调节和非线性编码能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进数值冰盖模型模拟器的性能，通过更好的特征调节和非线性编码来提高准确性和效率。

Method: 在GCN前端放置KAN网络，应用可学习的一维扭曲和线性混合步骤，不增加消息传递深度。使用36个融化率模拟和3种网格尺寸设置进行训练和测试。

Result: 在2-5层架构中，KAN-GCN匹配或超过纯GCN和MLP-GCN基线的准确性。在较粗网格上通过替换消息传递层提高了推理吞吐量，仅在最细网格上有适度成本。

Conclusion: KAN优先设计为大型瞬态场景扫描提供了有利的准确性与效率权衡。

Abstract: We introduce KAN-GCN, a fast and accurate emulator for ice sheet modeling
that places a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) as a feature-wise calibrator
before graph convolution networks (GCNs). The KAN front end applies learnable
one-dimensional warps and a linear mixing step, improving feature conditioning
and nonlinear encoding without increasing message-passing depth. We employ this
architecture to improve the performance of emulators for numerical ice sheet
models. Our emulator is trained and tested using 36 melting-rate simulations
with 3 mesh-size settings for Pine Island Glacier, Antarctica. Across 2- to
5-layer architectures, KAN-GCN matches or exceeds the accuracy of pure GCN and
MLP-GCN baselines. Despite a small parameter overhead, KAN-GCN improves
inference throughput on coarser meshes by replacing one edge-wise
message-passing layer with a node-wise transform; only the finest mesh shows a
modest cost. Overall, KAN-first designs offer a favorable accuracy vs.
efficiency trade-off for large transient scenario sweeps.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了WBT-BGRL框架，通过加权三元组损失改进自举学习，用于二分图的归纳链接预测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 二分图链接预测在推荐系统和故障检测中很重要，但现有方法在归纳、加权和二分场景下效果未经测试，对比方法存在负采样效率低和偏差问题

Method: 使用双GCN编码器的二分架构，在自举学习中引入加权机制的三元组损失，是非对比学习方法

Result: 在真实数据集（工业和电商）上表现有竞争力，特别是预训练时应用加权机制效果更好

Conclusion: 加权非对比学习对二分图归纳链接预测具有重要价值

Abstract: Link prediction in bipartite graphs is crucial for applications like
recommendation systems and failure detection, yet it is less studied than in
monopartite graphs. Contrastive methods struggle with inefficient and biased
negative sampling, while non-contrastive approaches rely solely on positive
samples. Existing models perform well in transductive settings, but their
effectiveness in inductive, weighted, and bipartite scenarios remains untested.
To address this, we propose Weighted Bipartite Triplet-Bootstrapped Graph
Latents (WBT-BGRL), a non-contrastive framework that enhances bootstrapped
learning with a novel weighting mechanism in the triplet loss. Using a
bipartite architecture with dual GCN encoders, WBT-BGRL is evaluated against
adapted state-of-the-art models (T-BGRL, BGRL, GBT, CCA-SSG). Results on
real-world datasets (Industry and E-commerce) show competitive performance,
especially when weighting is applied during pretraining-highlighting the value
of weighted, non-contrastive learning for inductive link prediction in
bipartite graphs.

*Jiachen Zhao,Yiyou Sun,Weiyan Shi,Dawn Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs生成的思维链中许多推理步骤并不真正影响最终预测，提出了True Thinking Score来量化每个步骤的因果影响，揭示了模型经常混合真实思考步骤和装饰性思考步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前假设思维链中的推理步骤是模型内部思考过程的忠实反映，但研究发现许多步骤实际上并不真正贡献于预测，这影响了LLM推理的效率和思维链的可信度。

Method: 提出了True Thinking Score来测量每个推理步骤对最终预测的因果影响，并识别了LLMs潜在空间中的TrueThinking方向，通过沿此方向引导可以控制模型执行或忽略特定推理步骤。

Result: 在AIME数据集上，平均只有2.3%的推理步骤具有高TTS值（≥0.7），自我验证步骤也可能是装饰性的，沿TrueThinking方向引导可以改变最终结果。

Conclusion: LLMs经常口头表达推理步骤而不在内部实际执行，这削弱了LLM推理的效率和思维链的可信度。

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) can generate long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
at test time, enabling them to solve complex tasks. These reasoning steps in
CoT are often assumed as a faithful reflection of the model's internal thinking
process, and used to monitor unsafe intentions. However, we find many reasoning
steps don't truly contribute to LLMs' prediction. We measure the step-wise
causal influence of each reasoning step on the model's final prediction with a
proposed True Thinking Score (TTS). We reveal that LLMs often interleave
between true-thinking steps (which are genuinely used to produce the final
output) and decorative-thinking steps (which only give the appearance of
reasoning but have minimal causal impact). Notably, only a small subset of the
total reasoning steps have a high TTS that causally drive the model's
prediction: e.g., for the AIME dataset, only an average of 2.3% of reasoning
steps in CoT have a TTS >= 0.7 (range: 0-1) under the Qwen-2.5 model.
Furthermore, we identify a TrueThinking direction in the latent space of LLMs.
By steering along or against this direction, we can force the model to perform
or disregard certain CoT steps when computing the final result. Finally, we
highlight that self-verification steps in CoT (i.e., aha moments) can also be
decorative, where LLMs do not truly verify their solution. Steering along the
TrueThinking direction can force internal reasoning over these steps, resulting
in a change in the final results. Overall, our work reveals that LLMs often
verbalize reasoning steps without actually performing them internally, which
undermines both the efficiency of LLM reasoning and the trustworthiness of CoT.

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言模型存在文化敏感神经元，这些神经元对特定文化背景的输入表现出选择性敏感，影响文化多样性视觉问答任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型表现优异，但在处理文化相关输入时仍存在困难，需要理解模型如何处理文化背景信息。

Method: 使用CVQA基准测试，识别文化选择性神经元，并通过消融实验进行因果测试，提出新的基于边际的选择器CAS。

Result: 在三个VLMs和25个文化群体上的实验证明，消融特定文化敏感神经元会显著影响对应文化问题的性能，而对其他文化影响很小。CAS方法在识别文化敏感神经元方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 文化敏感神经元倾向于聚集在某些解码层中，这为理解多模态表征的内部组织提供了新视角。

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance, vision-language models (VLMs) still
struggle on culturally situated inputs. To understand how VLMs process
culturally grounded information, we study the presence of culture-sensitive
neurons, i.e. neurons whose activations show preferential sensitivity to inputs
associated with particular cultural contexts. We examine whether such neurons
are important for culturally diverse visual question answering and where they
are located. Using the CVQA benchmark, we identify neurons of culture
selectivity and perform causal tests by deactivating the neurons flagged by
different identification methods. Experiments on three VLMs across 25 cultural
groups demonstrate the existence of neurons whose ablation disproportionately
harms performance on questions about the corresponding cultures, while having
minimal effects on others. Moreover, we propose a new margin-based selector -
Contrastive Activation Selection (CAS), and show that it outperforms existing
probability- and entropy-based methods in identifying culture-sensitive
neurons. Finally, our layer-wise analyses reveals that such neurons tend to
cluster in certain decoder layers. Overall, our findings shed new light on the
internal organization of multimodal representations.

Motivation: 解决机器学习在嵌入式平台上的计算需求增长问题，需要在保证效率的同时提供可靠的预测，特别是在分布偏移或未见数据的情况下。

Method: 采用算法-硬件协同设计：算法层面通过模型压缩和近似贝叶斯推理减少计算；硬件层面优化数字加速器并探索模拟硬件实现。具体包括Galen自动压缩、噪声训练、概率推理近似方法等。

Result: 开发了多种资源高效且鲁棒的推理技术，包括自动层特定压缩、非平稳噪声训练、概率光子计算等，显著提升了效率和可靠性。

Conclusion: 研究表明通过算法-硬件协同设计可以同时推进效率和可靠性，为下一代可信赖、高能效的机器学习系统奠定基础。

Abstract: While modern machine learning has transformed numerous application domains,
its growing computational demands increasingly constrain scalability and
efficiency, particularly on embedded and resource-limited platforms. In
practice, neural networks must not only operate efficiently but also provide
reliable predictions under distributional shifts or unseen data. Bayesian
neural networks offer a principled framework for quantifying uncertainty, yet
their computational overhead further compounds these challenges.
  This work advances resource-efficient and robust inference for both
conventional and Bayesian neural networks through the joint pursuit of
algorithmic and hardware efficiency. The former reduces computation through
model compression and approximate Bayesian inference, while the latter
optimizes deployment on digital accelerators and explores analog hardware,
bridging algorithmic design and physical realization. The first contribution,
Galen, performs automatic layer-specific compression guided by sensitivity
analysis and hardware-in-the-loop feedback. Analog accelerators offer
efficiency gains at the cost of noise; this work models device imperfections
and extends noisy training to nonstationary conditions, improving robustness
and stability. A second line of work advances probabilistic inference,
developing analytic and ensemble approximations that replace costly sampling,
integrate into a compiler stack, and optimize embedded inference. Finally,
probabilistic photonic computing introduces a paradigm where controlled analog
noise acts as an intrinsic entropy source, enabling fast, energy-efficient
probabilistic inference directly in hardware.
  Together, these studies demonstrate how efficiency and reliability can be
advanced jointly through algorithm-hardware co-design, laying the foundation
for the next generation of trustworthy, energy-efficient machine-learning
systems.

Motivation: 针对物理学中双曲波传播数据的高维特性，寻求一种能够有效降维并保持物理意义的数据驱动方法。

Method: 在超网络框架中使用低秩神经表示(LRNR)架构，结合深度学习技术直接从数据中学习波传播的低维表示。

Result: 训练后的LRNR自然产生低秩张量表示，揭示了波传播的新分解方式，每个分解模式对应可解释的物理特征，并支持通过压缩方案实现高效推理。

Conclusion: LRNR架构能够有效学习波传播的高效低维表示，不仅具有理论保证，还能揭示物理可解释性，在性能要求高的场景中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: We present a data-driven dimensionality reduction method that is well-suited
for physics-based data representing hyperbolic wave propagation. The method
utilizes a specialized neural network architecture called low rank neural
representation (LRNR) inside a hypernetwork framework. The architecture is
motivated by theoretical results that rigorously prove the existence of
efficient representations for this wave class. We illustrate through archetypal
examples that such an efficient low-dimensional representation of propagating
waves can be learned directly from data through a combination of deep learning
techniques. We observe that a low rank tensor representation arises naturally
in the trained LRNRs, and that this reveals a new decomposition of wave
propagation where each decomposed mode corresponds to interpretable physical
features. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LRNR architecture enables
efficient inference via a compression scheme, which is a potentially important
feature when deploying LRNRs in demanding performance regimes.

Conclusion: 语言模型的低秩结构提供了一个通用的理论抽象，其理论预测与实验结果一致，并给出了可证明的学习保证。

Abstract: A major problem in the study of large language models is to understand their
inherent low-dimensional structure. We introduce an approach to study the
low-dimensional structure of language models at a model-agnostic level: as
sequential probabilistic models. We first empirically demonstrate that a wide
range of modern language models exhibit low-rank structure: in particular,
matrices built from the model's logits for varying sets of prompts and
responses have low approximate rank. We then show that this low-rank structure
can be leveraged for generation -- in particular, we can generate a response to
a target prompt using a linear combination of the model's outputs on unrelated,
or even nonsensical prompts.
  On the theoretical front, we observe that studying the approximate rank of
language models in the sense discussed above yields a simple universal
abstraction whose theoretical predictions parallel our experiments. We then
analyze the representation power of the abstraction and give provable learning
guarantees.

Abstract: Machine Learning-assisted directed evolution (MLDE) is a powerful tool for
efficiently navigating antibody fitness landscapes. Many structure-aware MLDE
pipelines rely on a single conformation or a single committee across all
conformations, limiting their ability to separate conformational uncertainty
from epistemic uncertainty. Here, we introduce a rank -conditioned committee
(RCC) framework that leverages ranked conformations to assign a deep neural
network committee per rank. This design enables a principled separation between
epistemic uncertainty and conformational uncertainty. We validate our approach
on SARS-CoV-2 antibody docking, demonstrating significant improvements over
baseline strategies. Our results offer a scalable route for therapeutic
antibody discovery while directly addressing the challenge of modeling
conformational uncertainty.

Abstract: While many problems in machine learning focus on learning mappings between
finite-dimensional spaces, scientific applications require approximating
mappings between function spaces, i.e., operators. We study the problem of
learning collections of operators and provide both theoretical and empirical
advances. We distinguish between two regimes: (i) multiple operator learning,
where a single network represents a continuum of operators parameterized by a
parametric function, and (ii) learning several distinct single operators, where
each operator is learned independently. For the multiple operator case, we
introduce two new architectures, $\mathrm{MNO}$ and $\mathrm{MONet}$, and
establish universal approximation results in three settings: continuous,
integrable, or Lipschitz operators. For the latter, we further derive explicit
scaling laws that quantify how the network size must grow to achieve a target
approximation accuracy. For learning several single operators, we develop a
framework for balancing architectural complexity across subnetworks and show
how approximation order determines computational efficiency. Empirical
experiments on parametric PDE benchmarks confirm the strong expressive power
and efficiency of the proposed architectures. Overall, this work establishes a
unified theoretical and practical foundation for scalable neural operator
learning across multiple operators.

Abstract: The exponential growth of data volumes has led to escalating computational
costs in machine learning model training. However, many features fail to
contribute positively to model performance while consuming substantial
computational resources. This paper presents an end-to-end feature selection
framework for tabular data based on game theory. We formulate feature selection
procedure based on a cooperative game where features are modeled as players,
and their importance is determined through the evaluation of synergistic
interactions and marginal contributions. The proposed framework comprises four
core components: sample selection, game-theoretic feature importance
evaluation, redundant feature elimination, and optimized model training.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves substantial
computation reduction while preserving predictive performance, thereby offering
an efficient solution of the computational challenges of large-scale machine
learning. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的矩阵常因采样、素描和量化而产生噪声，但低秩逆近似的谱范数鲁棒性研究仍不充分，需要系统分析噪声环境下的误差界限。

Method: 在温和噪声假设下，使用轮廓积分技术分析非全纯函数f(z)=1/z，推导出考虑特征间隙、谱衰减和噪声与低曲率方向对齐的尖锐非渐近扰动界限。

Result: 新界限相比经典全逆界限改进高达√n倍，经验验证显示新界限能准确跟踪真实扰动误差，而基于经典结果的估计往往显著过预测。

Conclusion: 研究为噪声计算环境中低秩逆近似提供了实用的、频谱感知的保证，改进了现有理论界限。

Abstract: Low-rank pseudoinverses are widely used to approximate matrix inverses in
scalable machine learning, optimization, and scientific computing. However,
real-world matrices are often observed with noise, arising from sampling,
sketching, and quantization. The spectral-norm robustness of low-rank inverse
approximations remains poorly understood. We systematically study the
spectral-norm error $\| (\tilde{A}^{-1})_p - A_p^{-1} \|$ for an $n\times n$
symmetric matrix $A$, where $A_p^{-1}$ denotes the best rank-\(p\)
approximation of $A^{-1}$, and $\tilde{A} = A + E$ is a noisy observation.
Under mild assumptions on the noise, we derive sharp non-asymptotic
perturbation bounds that reveal how the error scales with the eigengap,
spectral decay, and noise alignment with low-curvature directions of $A$. Our
analysis introduces a novel application of contour integral techniques to the
\emph{non-entire} function $f(z) = 1/z$, yielding bounds that improve over
naive adaptations of classical full-inverse bounds by up to a factor of
$\sqrt{n}$. Empirically, our bounds closely track the true perturbation error
across a variety of real-world and synthetic matrices, while estimates based on
classical results tend to significantly overpredict. These findings offer
practical, spectrum-aware guarantees for low-rank inverse approximations in
noisy computational environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散策略在离线强化学习中具有竞争力，但采样时通常使用缺乏统计风险概念的启发式方法，需要引入统计意义上的风险控制。

Method: 累积对数似然比，并使用逻辑控制器门控条件均值，其阈值τ在校准后满足用户指定的Type-I水平α。该方法保持训练过程不变，仅在推理时应用LRT引导。

Result: 在D4RL MuJoCo任务上，LRT-Diffusion在保持期望α水平的同时，相比强Q引导基线改善了回报-OOD权衡。

Conclusion: LRT-Diffusion是一种即插即用的推理时方法，为离线RL中的扩散策略添加了原则性、可校准的风险控制。

Abstract: Diffusion policies are competitive for offline reinforcement learning (RL)
but are typically guided at sampling time by heuristics that lack a statistical
notion of risk. We introduce LRT-Diffusion, a risk-aware sampling rule that
treats each denoising step as a sequential hypothesis test between the
unconditional prior and the state-conditional policy head. Concretely, we
accumulate a log-likelihood ratio and gate the conditional mean with a logistic
controller whose threshold tau is calibrated once under H0 to meet a
user-specified Type-I level alpha. This turns guidance from a fixed push into
an evidence-driven adjustment with a user-interpretable risk budget.
Importantly, we deliberately leave training vanilla (two heads with standard
epsilon-prediction) under the structure of DDPM. LRT guidance composes
naturally with Q-gradients: critic-gradient updates can be taken at the
unconditional mean, at the LRT-gated mean, or a blend, exposing a continuum
from exploitation to conservatism. We standardize states and actions
consistently at train and test time and report a state-conditional
out-of-distribution (OOD) metric alongside return. On D4RL MuJoCo tasks,
LRT-Diffusion improves the return-OOD trade-off over strong Q-guided baselines
in our implementation while honoring the desired alpha. Theoretically, we
establish level-alpha calibration, concise stability bounds, and a return
comparison showing when LRT surpasses Q-guidance-especially when off-support
errors dominate. Overall, LRT-Diffusion is a drop-in, inference-time method
that adds principled, calibrated risk control to diffusion policies for offline
RL.

### [205] [Spectral Perturbation Bounds for Low-Rank Approximation with Applications to Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25670)
*Phuc Tran,Nisheeth K. Vishnoi,Van H. Vu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文建立了对称矩阵谱范数扰动的新边界，改进了经典的Eckart-Young-Mirsky定理，并应用于差分隐私PCA，解决了文献中的开放问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习中需要理解噪声或测量误差如何影响低秩逼近，特别是在谱范数下。差分隐私低秩逼近需要保持数据矩阵的top-p结构同时确保隐私，但现有工作主要分析Frobenius范数误差，可能高估或低估真实子空间失真。

Method: 使用复分析中的新颖轮廓引导方法，并将其扩展到包括多项式和矩阵指数在内的广泛谱函数类。在温和的特征值间隙和范数条件下，建立了对称矩阵的高概率谱范数扰动边界。

Result: 新边界对‖(A+E)_p - A_p‖提供了尖锐估计，改进因子高达√n。经验结果证实边界在不同扰动机制下紧密跟踪实际谱误差。

Conclusion: 本文的谱范数扰动边界为差分隐私PCA提供了改进的效用保证，解决了文献中的开放问题，并且分析方法可扩展到更广泛的谱函数类。

Abstract: A central challenge in machine learning is to understand how noise or
measurement errors affect low-rank approximations, particularly in the spectral
norm. This question is especially important in differentially private low-rank
approximation, where one aims to preserve the top-$p$ structure of a
data-derived matrix while ensuring privacy. Prior work often analyzes Frobenius
norm error or changes in reconstruction quality, but these metrics can over- or
under-estimate true subspace distortion. The spectral norm, by contrast,
captures worst-case directional error and provides the strongest utility
guarantees. We establish new high-probability spectral-norm perturbation bounds
for symmetric matrices that refine the classical Eckart--Young--Mirsky theorem
and explicitly capture interactions between a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n
\times n}$ and an arbitrary symmetric perturbation $E$. Under mild eigengap and
norm conditions, our bounds yield sharp estimates for $\|(A + E)_p - A_p\|$,
where $A_p$ is the best rank-$p$ approximation of $A$, with improvements of up
to a factor of $\sqrt{n}$. As an application, we derive improved utility
guarantees for differentially private PCA, resolving an open problem in the
literature. Our analysis relies on a novel contour bootstrapping method from
complex analysis and extends it to a broad class of spectral functionals,
including polynomials and matrix exponentials. Empirical results on real-world
datasets confirm that our bounds closely track the actual spectral error under
diverse perturbation regimes.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种结合癫痫实时检测和预测的新方法，使用多种机器学习算法在CHB-MIT头皮脑电图数据库上进行评估，旨在实现从被动治疗到主动预防的转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅在癫痫发作后检测，限制了早期干预机会。本研究旨在开发能够预测癫痫发作的方法，实现更主动的治疗策略。

Method: 使用CHB-MIT头皮脑电图数据库（969小时记录，173次发作），采用KNN、逻辑回归、随机森林、SVM进行癫痫检测，使用LSTM网络进行癫痫预测。

Result: 逻辑回归检测准确率90.9%，召回率89.6%；随机森林和SVM准确率94.0%但召回率为0%；LSTM预测准确率89.26%。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了开发实时监测工具的潜力，能够预测癫痫发作，实现从被动管理到主动预防的转变，帮助患者采取预防措施降低风险。

Abstract: In recent years, machine learning has become an increasingly powerful tool
for supporting seizure detection and monitoring in epilepsy care. Traditional
approaches focus on identifying seizures only after they begin, which limits
the opportunity for early intervention and proactive treatment. In this study,
we propose a novel approach that integrates both real-time seizure detection
and prediction, aiming to capture subtle temporal patterns in EEG data that may
indicate an upcoming seizure. Our approach was evaluated using the CHB-MIT
Scalp EEG Database, which includes 969 hours of recordings and 173 seizures
collected from 23 pediatric and young adult patients with drug-resistant
epilepsy. To support seizure detection, we implemented a range of supervised
machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic
Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. The Logistic Regression
achieved 90.9% detection accuracy with 89.6% recall, demonstrating balanced
performance suitable for clinical screening. Random Forest and Support Vector
Machine models achieved higher accuracy (94.0%) but with 0% recall, failing to
detect any seizures, illustrating that accuracy alone is insufficient for
evaluating medical ML models with class imbalance. For seizure prediction, we
employed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which use deep learning to
model temporal dependencies in EEG data. The LSTM model achieved 89.26%
prediction accuracy. These results highlight the potential of developing
accessible, real-time monitoring tools that not only detect seizures as
traditionally done, but also predict them before they occur. This ability to
predict seizures marks a significant shift from reactive seizure management to
a more proactive approach, allowing patients to anticipate seizures and take
precautionary measures to reduce the risk of injury or other complications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用李对称性精确求解初边值问题的方法，通过对称变换将物理定律内置于模型中，从初始和边界数据学习解，比PINNs更快更准确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如PINNs在求解偏微分方程约束问题时存在收敛慢和精度不足的问题，需要一种能更高效、更可靠地求解IBVPs的方法。

Method: 利用李对称性变换，通过构造方式精确满足偏微分方程，模型从初始和边界数据学习解，损失函数直接衡量模型精度。

Result: LieSolver在线性齐次偏微分方程的各种初始条件下，相比PINNs速度更快、精度更高，并支持严格的误差估计。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了PDE约束问题的计算效率和预测可靠性，产生紧凑模型便于高效优化。

Abstract: We introduce a method for efficiently solving initial-boundary value problems
(IBVPs) that uses Lie symmetries to enforce the associated partial differential
equation (PDE) exactly by construction. By leveraging symmetry transformations,
the model inherently incorporates the physical laws and learns solutions from
initial and boundary data. As a result, the loss directly measures the model's
accuracy, leading to improved convergence. Moreover, for well-posed IBVPs, our
method enables rigorous error estimation. The approach yields compact models,
facilitating an efficient optimization. We implement LieSolver and demonstrate
its application to linear homogeneous PDEs with a range of initial conditions,
showing that it is faster and more accurate than physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs). Overall, our method improves both computational efficiency
and the reliability of predictions for PDE-constrained problems.

Conclusion: 通过变化点分割整合结构先验能够在复杂环境中产生更可解释、样本高效和鲁棒的分层策略。

Abstract: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) enhances the scalability of
decision-making in long-horizon tasks by introducing temporal abstraction
through options-policies that span multiple timesteps. Despite its theoretical
appeal, the practical implementation of HRL suffers from the challenge of
autonomously discovering semantically meaningful subgoals and learning optimal
option termination boundaries. This paper introduces a novel architecture that
integrates a self-supervised, Transformer-based Change Point Detection (CPD)
module into the Option-Critic framework, enabling adaptive segmentation of
state trajectories and the discovery of options. The CPD module is trained
using heuristic pseudo-labels derived from intrinsic signals to infer latent
shifts in environment dynamics without external supervision. These inferred
change-points are leveraged in three critical ways: (i) to serve as supervisory
signals for stabilizing termination function gradients, (ii) to pretrain
intra-option policies via segment-wise behavioral cloning, and (iii) to enforce
functional specialization through inter-option divergence penalties over
CPD-defined state partitions. The overall optimization objective enhances the
standard actor-critic loss using structure-aware auxiliary losses. In our
framework, option discovery arises naturally as CPD-defined trajectory segments
are mapped to distinct intra-option policies, enabling the agent to
autonomously partition its behavior into reusable, semantically meaningful
skills. Experiments on the Four-Rooms and Pinball tasks demonstrate that
CPD-guided agents exhibit accelerated convergence, higher cumulative returns,
and significantly improved option specialization. These findings confirm that
integrating structural priors via change-point segmentation leads to more
interpretable, sample-efficient, and robust hierarchical policies in complex
environments.

TL;DR: 本文系统解构了矩阵白化优化器，发现其性能优势主要来自方差适应而非精确谱归一化，方差适应版本始终优于符号下降对应方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究各种近似矩阵白化变换的优化器，旨在分离解释性能的关键组件，理解为什么矩阵白化方法比逐元素方法表现更好。

Method: 通过实验系统解构矩阵白化优化器，比较不同变体的性能，分析方差适应策略的有效性，包括前瞻式近似和低秩方差估计器。

Result: 所有矩阵白化方法都可靠地优于Adam等逐元素方法；性能提升主要来自方差适应而非精确谱归一化；低秩方差估计器能有效降低内存成本而无性能损失。

Conclusion: 矩阵白化优化器的性能优势主要由方差适应组件驱动，而非精确的谱下降方向，方差适应是解释性能差距的关键因素。

Abstract: A range of recent optimizers have emerged that approximate the same
"matrix-whitening" transformation in various ways. In this work, we
systematically deconstruct such optimizers, aiming to disentangle the key
components that explain performance. Across tuned hyperparameters across the
board, all flavors of matrix-whitening methods reliably outperform elementwise
counterparts, such as Adam. Matrix-whitening is often related to spectral
descent -- however, experiments reveal that performance gains are *not
explained solely by accurate spectral normalization* -- particularly, SOAP
displays the largest per-step gain, even though Muon more accurately descends
along the steepest spectral descent direction. Instead, we argue that
matrix-whitening serves two purposes, and the variance adaptation component of
matrix-whitening is the overlooked ingredient explaining this performance gap.
Experiments show that variance-adapted versions of optimizers consistently
outperform their sign-descent counterparts, including an adaptive version of
Muon. We further ablate variance adaptation strategies, finding that while
lookahead style approximations are not as effective, low-rank variance
estimators can effectively reduce memory costs without a performance loss.

Motivation: 在多区域神经数据建模中，分离共享网络级动态与区域特定活动是一个核心挑战。

Method: SPIRE使用深度多编码器自编码器，引入新颖的对齐和解缠损失，仅基于基线数据进行训练。

Result: 在合成基准测试中，SPIRE在非线性失真和时间错位下优于经典概率模型。在颅内深部脑刺激记录中，SPIRE显示共享潜在可靠编码刺激特异性特征，且跨位点和频率具有泛化性。

Conclusion: SPIRE是分析刺激下多区域神经动态的实用、可复现工具。

Abstract: Disentangling shared network-level dynamics from region-specific activity is
a central challenge in modeling multi-region neural data. We introduce SPIRE
(Shared-Private Inter-Regional Encoder), a deep multi-encoder autoencoder that
factorizes recordings into shared and private latent subspaces with novel
alignment and disentanglement losses. Trained solely on baseline data, SPIRE
robustly recovers cross-regional structure and reveals how external
perturbations reorganize it. On synthetic benchmarks with ground-truth latents,
SPIRE outperforms classical probabilistic models under nonlinear distortions
and temporal misalignments. Applied to intracranial deep brain stimulation
(DBS) recordings, SPIRE shows that shared latents reliably encode
stimulation-specific signatures that generalize across sites and frequencies.
These results establish SPIRE as a practical, reproducible tool for analyzing
multi-region neural dynamics under stimulation.

Result: 协议不变特征训练的模型在分布偏移下F1分数>0.85，而使用全部特征的模型性能下降40%。数据增强使预期校准误差降低35%，温度缩放效果有限。

Conclusion: 协议感知特征选择和受控模型研究能有效预测模型在分布偏移下的行为，为开发对真实世界协议变化具有鲁棒性的放射组学模型提供了框架。

Abstract: Radiomics-based machine learning models show promise for clinical decision
support but are vulnerable to distribution shifts caused by variations in
imaging protocols, positioning, and segmentation. This study systematically
investigates the robustness of radiomics-based machine learning models under
distribution shifts across five MRI sequences. We evaluated how different
acquisition protocols and segmentation strategies affect model reliability in
terms of predictive power and uncertainty-awareness. Using a phantom of 16
fruits, we evaluated distribution shifts through: (1) protocol variations
across T2-HASTE, T2-TSE, T2-MAP, T1-TSE, and T2-FLAIR sequences; (2)
segmentation variations (full, partial, rotated); and (3) inter-observer
variability. We trained XGBoost classifiers on 8 consistent robust features
versus sequence-specific features, testing model performance under in-domain
and out-of-domain conditions. Results demonstrate that models trained on
protocol-invariant features maintain F1-scores >0.85 across distribution
shifts, while models using all features showed 40% performance degradation
under protocol changes. Dataset augmentation substantially improved the quality
of uncertainty estimates and reduced the expected calibration error (ECE) by
35% without sacrificing accuracy. Temperature scaling provided minimal
calibration benefits, confirming XGBoost's inherent reliability. Our findings
reveal that protocol-aware feature selection and controlled phantom studies
effectively predict model behavior under distribution shifts, providing a
framework for developing robust radiomics models resilient to real-world
protocol variations.

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to recover graphs that represent causal relations among
given variables from observations, and new methods are constantly being
proposed. Increasingly, the community raises questions about how much progress
is made, because properly evaluating discovered graphs remains notoriously
difficult, particularly under latent confounding. We propose a graph distance
measure for acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) based on the downstream task
of cause-effect estimation under unobserved confounding. Our approach uses
identification via fixing and a symbolic verifier to quantify how graph
differences distort cause-effect estimands for different treatment-outcome
pairs. We analyze the behavior of the measure under different graph
perturbations and compare it against existing distance metrics.

Method: 基于传统方法，引入依赖历史数据的动态指导机制，动态更新动量和学习率，使优化器能灵活调整对历史信息的依赖，适应不同训练场景。

Result: 实验验证表明，DWMGrad在多种场景下能够实现更快的收敛速度和更高的准确率。

Conclusion: DWMGrad算法通过动态调整机制有效提升了优化性能，在复杂训练环境中表现出色。

Abstract: Within the current sphere of deep learning research, despite the extensive
application of optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), there remains a pronounced
inadequacy in their capability to address fluctuations in learning efficiency,
meet the demands of complex models, and tackle non-convex optimization issues.
These challenges primarily arise from the algorithms' limitations in handling
complex data structures and models, for instance, difficulties in selecting an
appropriate learning rate, avoiding local optima, and navigating through
high-dimensional spaces. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel
optimization algorithm named DWMGrad. This algorithm, building on the
foundations of traditional methods, incorporates a dynamic guidance mechanism
reliant on historical data to dynamically update momentum and learning rates.
This allows the optimizer to flexibly adjust its reliance on historical
information, adapting to various training scenarios. This strategy not only
enables the optimizer to better adapt to changing environments and task
complexities but also, as validated through extensive experimentation,
demonstrates DWMGrad's ability to achieve faster convergence rates and higher
accuracies under a multitude of scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce Bounded Numerical Differentiation (BOND), a perturbative method
for estimating partial derivatives across network structures with inaccessible

black-box functions, realized in our experiments as fixed, untrained networks,
can enhance model performance without increasing the number of trainable
parameters. This improvement is achieved without extensive optimization of the

highlight the potential of leveraging fixed, non-trainable modules to expand
model capacity, suggesting a path toward combining analogue and digital devices
as a mechanism for scaling networks.

Motivation: 现有基于LoRA的持续学习方法主要关注保留先前任务的性能，但这忽视了推荐系统的特殊性：目标不是预测过去的偏好，过时的偏好在当前兴趣显著变化时甚至会损害性能。

Method: 提出了PESO方法，引入近端正则化器将当前适配器锚定到其最近的冻结状态，使模型能够灵活平衡适应性和保留性，更好地捕捉近期用户行为。

Conclusion: PESO通过近端正则化有效解决了推荐系统中LoRA持续学习的挑战，在适应性和保留性之间实现了更好的平衡。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance in
recommendation, they face challenges in continual learning as users, items, and
user preferences evolve over time. Existing LoRA-based continual methods
primarily focus on preserving performance on previous tasks, but this overlooks
the unique nature of recommendation: the goal is not to predict past
preferences, and outdated preferences can even harm performance when current
interests shift significantly. To address this, we propose PESO (Proximally
rEgularized Single evolving lOra, a continual adaptation method for LoRA in
recommendation. PESO introduces a proximal regularizer that anchors the current
adapter to its most recent frozen state, enabling the model to flexibly balance
adaptation and preservation, and to better capture recent user behaviors.
Theoretically, we show that this proximal design provides data-aware,
direction-wise guidance in the LoRA subspace. Empirically, PESO consistently
outperforms existing LoRA-based continual learning methods.

TL;DR: FairMIB是一个多视图信息瓶颈框架，通过将图分解为特征、结构和扩散视图来缓解GNN中的复杂性偏见，使用对比学习和多视角条件信息瓶颈目标来平衡任务效用和公平性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的公平性方法通常将偏见视为单一来源，忽略了属性和结构效应的区别，导致公平性和效用之间的权衡不理想。GNN在传递消息时会放大训练数据偏见，传播歧视性属性和结构不平衡。

Method: 提出FairMIB框架：1）将图分解为三个视图；2）使用对比学习最大化跨视图互信息；3）集成多视角条件信息瓶颈目标最小化与敏感属性的互信息；4）在扩散视图中引入逆概率加权邻接校正来减少偏见传播。

Result: 在五个真实世界基准数据集上的实验表明，FairMIB在效用和公平性指标上都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FairMIB通过多视图分解和信息瓶颈方法有效解决了GNN中的公平性问题，在保持任务效用的同时显著提升了公平性。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel on relational data by passing messages
over node features and structure, but they can amplify training data biases,
propagating discriminatory attributes and structural imbalances into unfair
outcomes. Many fairness methods treat bias as a single source, ignoring
distinct attribute and structure effects and leading to suboptimal fairness and
utility trade-offs. To overcome this challenge, we propose FairMIB, a
multi-view information bottleneck framework designed to decompose graphs into
feature, structural, and diffusion views for mitigating complexity biases in
GNNs. Especially, the proposed FairMIB employs contrastive learning to maximize
cross-view mutual information for bias-free representation learning. It further
integrates multi-perspective conditional information bottleneck objectives to
balance task utility and fairness by minimizing mutual information with
sensitive attributes. Additionally, FairMIB introduces an inverse
probability-weighted (IPW) adjacency correction in the diffusion view, which
reduces the spread of bias propagation during message passing. Experiments on
five real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairMIB achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both utility and fairness metrics.

Abstract: We consider training and testing on mixture distributions with different
training and test proportions. We show that in many settings, and in some sense
generically, distribution shift can be beneficial, and test performance can
improve due to mismatched training proportions, even if the components are
unrelated and with no transfer between components. In a variety of scenarios,
we identify the optimal training proportions and the extent to which such
distribution shift can be beneficial. We show how the same analysis applies
also to a compositional setting with differing distribution of component
"skills'' at training and test.

Conclusion: NDM代表了向几何结构化、可解释和高效深度学习系统的根本转变，尽管仍存在计算挑战

Abstract: This paper introduces the Neural Differential Manifold (NDM), a novel neural
network architecture that explicitly incorporates geometric structure into its
fundamental design. Departing from conventional Euclidean parameter spaces, the
NDM re-conceptualizes a neural network as a differentiable manifold where each
layer functions as a local coordinate chart, and the network parameters
directly parameterize a Riemannian metric tensor at every point. The
architecture is organized into three synergistic layers: a Coordinate Layer
implementing smooth chart transitions via invertible transformations inspired
by normalizing flows, a Geometric Layer that dynamically generates the
manifold's metric through auxiliary sub-networks, and an Evolution Layer that
optimizes both task performance and geometric simplicity through a
dual-objective loss function. This geometric regularization penalizes excessive
curvature and volume distortion, providing intrinsic regularization that
enhances generalization and robustness. The framework enables natural gradient
descent optimization aligned with the learned manifold geometry and offers
unprecedented interpretability by endowing internal representations with clear
geometric meaning. We analyze the theoretical advantages of this approach,
including its potential for more efficient optimization, enhanced continual
learning, and applications in scientific discovery and controllable generative

Abstract: Adversarial learning has been attracting more and more attention thanks to
the fast development of machine learning and artificial intelligence. However,
due to the complicated structure of most machine learning models, the mechanism
of adversarial attacks is not well interpreted. How to measure the effect of
attack is still not quite clear. In this paper, we propose a unified bilevel
model for adversarial learning. We further investigate the adversarial attack
in clustering models and interpret it from data perturbation point of view. We
reveal that when the data perturbation is relatively small, the clustering
model is robust, whereas if it is relatively large, the clustering result
changes, which leads to an attack. To measure the effect of attacks for
clustering models, we analyse the well-definedness of the so-called
$\delta$-measure, which can be used in the proposed bilevel model for
adversarial learning of clustering models.

TL;DR: BRIDGE是一个统一端到端架构，将序列编码器与图神经网络耦合在单一目标下，通过token级交叉注意力层实现邻居间细粒度消息传递，在社交网络和欺诈检测任务中优于现有方法。


<details>

Motivation: 现实世界数据集通常同时具有序列性和关系性，但现有方法往往忽略其中一种模态。作者认为序列和图不是分离的问题，而是同一数据集的互补方面，应该联合学习。

Method: 提出BRIDGE架构，将序列编码器与GNN在单一目标下耦合，允许梯度在两者间流动。添加TOKENXATTN层实现邻居序列间事件级的细粒度消息传递。

Result: 在友谊预测（Brightkite）和欺诈检测（Amazon）两个场景中，BRIDGE在排序和分类指标上持续优于静态GNN、时序图方法和纯序列基线。

Conclusion: 序列和图应该联合建模，BRIDGE通过耦合序列编码器和GNN实现了更好的表示学习，在多个任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Many real-world datasets are both sequential and relational: each node
carries an event sequence while edges encode interactions. Existing methods in
sequence modeling and graph modeling often neglect one modality or the other.
We argue that sequences and graphs are not separate problems but complementary
facets of the same dataset, and should be learned jointly. We introduce BRIDGE,
a unified end-to-end architecture that couples a sequence encoder with a GNN
under a single objective, allowing gradients to flow across both modules and
learning task-aligned representations. To enable fine-grained token-level
message passing among neighbors, we add TOKENXATTN, a token-level
cross-attention layer that passes messages between events in neighboring
sequences. Across two settings, friendship prediction (Brightkite) and fraud
detection (Amazon), BRIDGE consistently outperforms static GNNs, temporal graph
methods, and sequence-only baselines on ranking and classification metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一框架，将数据增强与因果推断结合，证明当结果生成机制对数据增强选择不变时，数据增强可被视为对治疗生成机制的干预，有助于减少隐藏混杂因素带来的因果效应估计偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据增强主要用于i.i.d.设置下的正则化，但在存在未观测混杂因素时，通常需要工具变量，而工具变量在许多应用中不如数据增强易得。本文旨在探索数据增强在跨干预泛化中的应用价值。

Method: 通过适当正则化基于工具变量的估计器，引入IV-like回归概念来缓解混杂偏差；将参数化数据增强建模为IV-like回归问题，并通过组合使用模拟最坏情况下的数据增强应用。

Result: 理论分析和模拟实验表明，该方法在因果估计和泛化任务上优于简单数据增强，在线性示例的有限样本情况下得到验证，并通过真实数据实验支持了结论。

Conclusion: 数据增强可以超越传统i.i.d.设置，在因果推断中作为工具变量的替代方案，通过IV-like回归框架有效改善跨干预的泛化性能和因果效应估计准确性。

Abstract: The technique of data augmentation (DA) is often used in machine learning for
regularization purposes to better generalize under i.i.d. settings. In this
work, we present a unifying framework with topics in causal inference to make a
case for the use of DA beyond just the i.i.d. setting, but for generalization
across interventions as well. Specifically, we argue that when the outcome
generating mechanism is invariant to our choice of DA, then such augmentations
can effectively be thought of as interventions on the treatment generating
mechanism itself. This can potentially help to reduce bias in causal effect
estimation arising from hidden confounders. In the presence of such unobserved
confounding we typically make use of instrumental variables (IVs) -- sources of
treatment randomization that are conditionally independent of the outcome.
However, IVs may not be as readily available as DA for many applications, which
is the main motivation behind this work. By appropriately regularizing IV based
estimators, we introduce the concept of IV-like (IVL) regression for mitigating
confounding bias and improving predictive performance across interventions even
when certain IV properties are relaxed. Finally, we cast parameterized DA as an
IVL regression problem and show that when used in composition can simulate a
worst-case application of such DA, further improving performance on causal
estimation and generalization tasks beyond what simple DA may offer. This is
shown both theoretically for the population case and via simulation experiments
for the finite sample case using a simple linear example. We also present real
data experiments to support our case.

Motivation: 现有方法在神经网络验证中面临近似误差问题，这些误差阻碍了获得紧的局部Lipschitz常数，而紧的Lipschitz常数对于认证鲁棒性至关重要。线性嫁接可以减少不稳定神经元数量，但缺乏理论解释其如何改善认证鲁棒性。

Method: 提出Lipschitz感知的线性嫁接方法，将非线性激活函数替换为线性函数，消除主导的近似误差源。从l∞局部Lipschitz常数角度分析线性嫁接如何改善认证鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，在线性嫁接影响较大的激活函数时，能够收紧l∞局部Lipschitz常数并增强认证鲁棒性，即使没有进行认证训练。

Conclusion: 线性嫁接通过消除近似误差来收紧局部Lipschitz常数，从而改善认证鲁棒性。该方法为理解线性嫁接在认证鲁棒性中的作用提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Lipschitz constant is a fundamental property in certified robustness, as
smaller values imply robustness to adversarial examples when a model is
confident in its prediction. However, identifying the worst-case adversarial
examples is known to be an NP-complete problem. Although over-approximation
methods have shown success in neural network verification to address this
challenge, reducing approximation errors remains a significant obstacle.
Furthermore, these approximation errors hinder the ability to obtain tight
local Lipschitz constants, which are crucial for certified robustness.
Originally, grafting linearity into non-linear activation functions was
proposed to reduce the number of unstable neurons, enabling scalable and
complete verification. However, no prior theoretical analysis has explained how
linearity grafting improves certified robustness. We instead consider linearity
grafting primarily as a means of eliminating approximation errors rather than
reducing the number of unstable neurons, since linear functions do not require
relaxation. In this paper, we provide two theoretical contributions: 1) why
linearity grafting improves certified robustness through the lens of the
$l_\infty$ local Lipschitz constant, and 2) grafting linearity into non-linear
activation functions, the dominant source of approximation errors, yields a
tighter local Lipschitz constant. Based on these theoretical contributions, we
propose a Lipschitz-aware linearity grafting method that removes dominant
approximation errors, which are crucial for tightening the local Lipschitz
constant, thereby improving certified robustness, even without certified
training. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that grafting linearity into
these influential activations tightens the $l_\infty$ local Lipschitz constant
and enhances certified robustness.

Abstract: To mitigate acute wildfire ignition risks, utilities de-energize power lines
in high-risk areas. The Optimal Power Shutoff (OPS) problem optimizes line
energization statuses to manage wildfire ignition risks through
de-energizations while reducing load shedding. OPS problems are computationally
challenging Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) that must be solved rapidly
and frequently in operational settings. For a particular power system, OPS
instances share a common structure with varying parameters related to wildfire
risks, loads, and renewable generation. This motivates the use of Machine
Learning (ML) for solving OPS problems by exploiting shared patterns across
instances. In this paper, we develop an ML-guided framework that quickly
produces high-quality de-energization decisions by extending existing ML-guided
MILP solution methods while integrating domain knowledge on the number of
energized and de-energized lines. Results on a large-scale realistic
California-based synthetic test system show that the proposed ML-guided method
produces high-quality solutions faster than traditional optimization methods.

Conclusion: 提出的协同优化算法有效解决了分布式机器学习中的资源分配问题，在保证收敛性的同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving research on artificial intelligence (AI) the demand
for fast, computationally efficient, and scalable solutions has increased in
recent years. The problem of optimizing the computing resources for distributed
machine learning (ML) and optimization is considered in this paper. Given a set
of data distributed over a network of computing-nodes/servers, the idea is to
optimally assign the CPU (central processing unit) usage while simultaneously
training each computing node locally via its own share of data. This formulates
the problem as a co-optimization setup to (i) optimize the data processing and
(ii) optimally allocate the computing resources. The information-sharing
network among the nodes might be time-varying, but with balanced weights to
ensure consensus-type convergence of the algorithm. The algorithm is all-time
feasible, which implies that the computing resource-demand balance constraint
holds at all iterations of the proposed solution. Moreover, the solution allows
addressing possible log-scale quantization over the information-sharing
channels to exchange log-quantized data. For some example applications,
distributed support-vector-machine (SVM) and regression are considered as the
ML training models. Results from perturbation theory, along with Lyapunov
stability and eigen-spectrum analysis, are used to prove the convergence
towards the optimal case. As compared to existing CPU scheduling solutions, the
proposed algorithm improves the cost optimality gap by more than $50\%$.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于深度时间序列预测的选择性学习策略，通过双重掩码机制筛选可泛化的时间步来避免过拟合


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度模型在时间序列预测中容易因噪声和异常值而严重过拟合，传统方法对所有时间步进行统一优化会导致模型学习不确定和异常的时间步

Method: 使用双重掩码机制：不确定性掩码利用残差熵过滤不确定时间步，异常掩码使用残差下界估计排除异常时间步，只选择可泛化时间步计算MSE损失

Result: 在8个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提升了主流深度模型的预测性能，包括Informer的MSE降低37.4%、TimesNet降低8.4%、iTransformer降低6.5%

Conclusion: 选择性学习策略能有效缓解深度时间序列预测中的过拟合问题，通过关注可泛化时间步来提升模型性能

Abstract: Benefiting from high capacity for capturing complex temporal patterns, deep
learning (DL) has significantly advanced time series forecasting (TSF).
However, deep models tend to suffer from severe overfitting due to the inherent
vulnerability of time series to noise and anomalies. The prevailing DL paradigm
uniformly optimizes all timesteps through the MSE loss and learns those
uncertain and anomalous timesteps without difference, ultimately resulting in
overfitting. To address this, we propose a novel selective learning strategy
for deep TSF. Specifically, selective learning screens a subset of the whole
timesteps to calculate the MSE loss in optimization, guiding the model to focus
on generalizable timesteps while disregarding non-generalizable ones. Our
framework introduces a dual-mask mechanism to target timesteps: (1) an
uncertainty mask leveraging residual entropy to filter uncertain timesteps, and
(2) an anomaly mask employing residual lower bound estimation to exclude
anomalous timesteps. Extensive experiments across eight real-world datasets
demonstrate that selective learning can significantly improve the predictive
performance for typical state-of-the-art deep models, including 37.4% MSE
reduction for Informer, 8.4% for TimesNet, and 6.5% for iTransformer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多类PU学习中现有方法难以保证无偏风险估计，限制了性能和稳定性，特别是在真实应用中标注可靠负样本困难或成本高昂的情况下。

Method: 在经验风险最小化框架下，为正向和从未标记混合数据中推断的负向损失组件分配不同的数据依赖权重，使经验目标成为目标风险的无偏估计器。

Result: 在8个公共数据集上的广泛实验显示，在不同类别先验和类别数量下，相比强基线方法在准确性和稳定性方面均取得一致提升。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应损失加权方法能够有效解决多类PU学习中的无偏风险估计问题，在多个数据集上表现出优越的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Positive--Unlabeled (PU) learning considers settings in which only positive
and unlabeled data are available, while negatives are missing or left
unlabeled. This situation is common in real applications where annotating
reliable negatives is difficult or costly. Despite substantial progress in PU
learning, the multi-class case (MPU) remains challenging: many existing
approaches do not ensure \emph{unbiased risk estimation}, which limits
performance and stability. We propose a cost-sensitive multi-class PU method
based on \emph{adaptive loss weighting}. Within the empirical risk minimization
framework, we assign distinct, data-dependent weights to the positive and
\emph{inferred-negative} (from the unlabeled mixture) loss components so that
the resulting empirical objective is an unbiased estimator of the target risk.
We formalize the MPU data-generating process and establish a generalization
error bound for the proposed estimator. Extensive experiments on \textbf{eight}
public datasets, spanning varying class priors and numbers of classes, show
consistent gains over strong baselines in both accuracy and stability.

<details>

Motivation: 现有研究表明深度学习优化存在二分现象：沿Hessian矩阵顶部特征方向的参数更新幅度大但对损失减少贡献小，而正交分量的更新幅度小但驱动大部分学习进展。

Method: 提出BSFA框架，通过PCA对历史更新进行高效子空间估计，采用分块策略在参数块级别应用估计，差异化缩放不同子空间的更新分量。

Result: 在多个任务上实现加速，特别是在LLaMA-72M和LLaMA-134M预训练中相比vanilla AdamW实现约2倍加速。

Conclusion: BSFA是一个实用且可扩展的即插即用框架，能有效加速深度学习训练同时保持稳定性。

Abstract: Recent studies \citep{gur2018gradient,song2024does, wen2024understanding}
highlight a fundamental dichotomy in deep learning optimization: Although
parameter updates along the top eigendirections of the loss Hessian (Dom-space)
capture most of the update magnitude, they often contribute minimally to loss
reduction. In contrast, updates in the orthogonal component (Bulk-space) have
smaller magnitudes but drive most learning progress. In this work, we further
advance the understanding of this phenomenon and introduce the
\textbf{Bulk-Space-Filtration-Accelerator (BSFA)}, a novel plug-and-play
framework. BSFA accelerates training by differentially scaling update
components projected onto these distinct subspaces, simultaneously enhancing
stability by moderating updates in the dominant subspace and boosting
convergence speed by amplifying those in the bulk-space. To ensure BSFA is both
practical and scalable for contemporary large models, we introduce two key
innovations: an efficient estimator using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on
historical updates for fast subspace estimation, and a block-wise strategy that
applies this estimation on a per-parameter-block basis. These designs make BSFA
computationally tractable and highly effective. We demonstrate BSFA's
acceleration across various tasks, notably achieving approximately 2$\times$
speedup when pre-training LLaMA-72M on WikiText-103 and LLaMA-134M on
OpenWebText compared to vanilla AdamW.

Abstract: Bayesian inference of Bayesian network structures is often performed by
sampling directed acyclic graphs along an appropriately constructed Markov

efficient implementation of basic moves, which add, delete, or reverse a single
arc. Second, we expedite summing over parent sets, an expensive task required
for more sophisticated moves: we devise a preprocessing method to prune
possible parent sets so as to approximately preserve the sums. Our empirical
study shows that our techniques can yield substantial efficiency gains compared
to previous methods.

Conclusion: IBNorm是一种简单而强大的归一化方法家族，基于信息瓶颈原理，能产生更具信息量的表示，同时保持训练稳定性。

Abstract: Normalization is fundamental to deep learning, but existing approaches such
as BatchNorm, LayerNorm, and RMSNorm are variance-centric by enforcing zero
mean and unit variance, stabilizing training without controlling how
representations capture task-relevant information. We propose IB-Inspired
Normalization (IBNorm), a simple yet powerful family of methods grounded in the
Information Bottleneck principle. IBNorm introduces bounded compression
operations that encourage embeddings to preserve predictive information while
suppressing nuisance variability, yielding more informative representations
while retaining the stability and compatibility of standard normalization.
Theoretically, we prove that IBNorm achieves a higher IB value and tighter
generalization bounds than variance-centric methods. Empirically, IBNorm
consistently outperforms BatchNorm, LayerNorm, and RMSNorm across large-scale
language models (LLaMA, GPT-2) and vision models (ResNet, ViT), with mutual

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success across a wide range of tasks,
but its models often suffer from instability and vulnerability: small changes
to the input may drastically affect predictions, while optimization can be
hindered by sharp loss landscapes. This thesis addresses these issues through
the unifying perspective of sensitivity analysis, which examines how neural
networks respond to perturbations at both the input and parameter levels.
  We study Lipschitz networks as a principled way to constrain sensitivity to
input perturbations, thereby improving generalization, adversarial robustness,
and training stability. To complement this architectural approach, we introduce
regularization techniques based on the curvature of the loss function,
promoting smoother optimization landscapes and reducing sensitivity to
parameter variations. Randomized smoothing is also explored as a probabilistic
method for enhancing robustness at decision boundaries.
  By combining these perspectives, we develop a unified framework where
Lipschitz continuity, randomized smoothing, and curvature regularization
interact to address fundamental challenges in stability. The thesis contributes
both theoretical analysis and practical methodologies, including efficient
spectral norm computation, novel Lipschitz-constrained layers, and improved
certification procedures.

Abstract: Modeling complex spatiotemporal dynamics, particularly in
far-from-equilibrium systems, remains a grand challenge in science. The
governing partial differential equations (PDEs) for these systems are often
intractable to derive from first principles, due to their inherent complexity,
characterized by high-order derivatives and strong nonlinearities, coupled with
incomplete physical knowledge. This has spurred the development of data-driven
methods, yet these approaches face limitations: Purely data-driven models are
often physically inconsistent and data-intensive, while existing
physics-informed methods lack the structural capacity to represent complex
operators or systematically integrate partial physical knowledge. Here, we
propose a hierarchical physics-embedded learning framework that fundamentally
advances both the forward spatiotemporal prediction and inverse discovery of
physical laws from sparse and noisy data. The key innovation is a two-level
architecture that mirrors the process of scientific discovery: the first level
learns fundamental symbolic components of a PDE, while the second learns their
governing combinations. This hierarchical decomposition not only reduces
learning complexity but, more importantly, enables a structural integration of
prior knowledge. Known physical laws are directly embedded into the models
computational graph, guaranteeing physical consistency and improving data
efficiency. By building the framework upon adaptive Fourier Neural Operators,
we can effectively capture the non-local dependencies and high-order operators
characteristic of dynamical systems. Additionally, by structurally decoupling
known and unknown terms, the framework further enables interpretable discovery
of underlying governing equations through symbolic regression, without
presupposing functional forms.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning algorithms are primarily focused on learning a policy
that maximizes expected return. As a result, the learned policy can exploit one
or few reward sources. However, in many natural situations, it is desirable to
learn a policy that induces a dispersed marginal state distribution over
rewarding states, while maximizing the expected return which is typically tied
to reaching a goal state. This aspect remains relatively unexplored. Existing
techniques based on entropy regularization and intrinsic rewards use
stochasticity for encouraging exploration to find an optimal policy which may
not necessarily lead to dispersed marginal state distribution over rewarding
states. Other RL algorithms which match a target distribution assume the latter
to be available apriori. This may be infeasible in large scale systems where
enumeration of all states is not possible and a state is determined to be a
goal state only upon reaching it. We formalize the problem of maximizing the
expected return while uniformly visiting the goal states as Multi Goal RL in
which an oracle classifier over the state space determines the goal states. We
propose a novel algorithm that learns a high-return policy mixture with
marginal state distribution dispersed over the set of goal states. Our
algorithm is based on optimizing a custom RL reward which is computed - based
on the current policy mixture - at each iteration for a set of sampled
trajectories. The latter are used via an offline RL algorithm to update the
policy mixture. We prove performance guarantees for our algorithm, showing
efficient convergence bounds for optimizing a natural objective which captures
the expected return as well as the dispersion of the marginal state

Abstract: Normalizing flows are deep generative models that enable efficient likelihood
estimation and sampling through invertible transformations. A key challenge is
to design linear layers that enhance expressiveness while maintaining efficient
computation of the Jacobian determinant and inverse. We introduce a novel
invertible linear layer based on the product of circulant and diagonal
matrices. This decomposition reduces parameter complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$ using $m$ diagonal matrices and $m-1$
circulant matrices while still approximating general linear transformations. By
leveraging the Fast Fourier Transform, our approach reduces the time complexity
of matrix inversion from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn\log n)$ and that
of computing the log-determinant from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$,
where $n$ is the input dimension. We build upon this layer to develop
Circulant-Diagonal Flow (CDFlow), which achieves strong density estimation on
natural image datasets and effectively models data with inherent periodic
structure. Furthermore, CDFlow significantly accelerates key operations in
normalizing flows, providing practical benefits for scalable generative
modeling.

Abstract: Information cascade popularity prediction is a key problem in analyzing
content diffusion in social networks. However, current related works suffer
from three critical limitations: (1) temporal leakage in current
evaluation--random cascade-based splits allow models to access future
information, yielding unrealistic results; (2) feature-poor datasets that lack
downstream conversion signals (e.g., likes, comments, or purchases), which
limits more practical applications; (3) computational inefficiency of complex
graph-based methods that require days of training for marginal gains. We
systematically address these challenges from three perspectives: task setup,
dataset construction, and model design. First, we propose a time-ordered
splitting strategy that chronologically partitions data into consecutive
windows, ensuring models are evaluated on genuine forecasting tasks without
future information leakage. Second, we introduce Taoke, a large-scale
e-commerce cascade dataset featuring rich promoter/product attributes and
ground-truth purchase conversions--capturing the complete diffusion lifecycle
from promotion to monetization. Third, we develop CasTemp, a lightweight
framework that efficiently models cascade dynamics through temporal walks,
Jaccard-based neighbor selection for inter-cascade dependencies, and GRU-based
encoding with time-aware attention. Under leak-free evaluation, CasTemp
achieves state-of-the-art performance across four datasets with
orders-of-magnitude speedup. Notably, it excels at predicting second-stage
popularity conversions--a practical task critical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Hypergraphs provide a natural framework for modeling higher-order
interactions, yet their theoretical underpinnings in semi-supervised learning
remain limited. We provide an asymptotic consistency analysis of variational
learning on random geometric hypergraphs, precisely characterizing the
conditions ensuring the well-posedness of hypergraph learning as well as
showing convergence to a weighted $p$-Laplacian equation. Motivated by this, we
propose Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL), which regularizes via powers
of Laplacians from skeleton graphs for multiscale smoothness. HOHL converges to
a higher-order Sobolev seminorm. Empirically, it performs strongly on standard
baselines.

Conclusion: 提出的加权平均方法在各种评估设置中一致地改善了性能，为知识图谱嵌入模型的集成学习提供了更高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Ensemble methods are widely employed to improve generalization in machine
learning. This has also prompted the adoption of ensemble learning for the
knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models in performing link prediction. Typical
approaches to this end train multiple models as part of the ensemble, and the
diverse predictions are then averaged. However, this approach has some
significant drawbacks. For instance, the computational overhead of training
multiple models increases latency and memory overhead. In contrast, model
merging approaches offer a promising alternative that does not require training
multiple models. In this work, we introduce model merging, specifically
weighted averaging, in KGE models. Herein, a running average of model
parameters from a training epoch onward is maintained and used for predictions.
To address this, we additionally propose an approach that selectively updates
the running average of the ensemble model parameters only when the
generalization performance improves on a validation dataset. We evaluate these
two different weighted averaging approaches on link prediction tasks, comparing
the state-of-the-art benchmark ensemble approach. Additionally, we evaluate the
weighted averaging approach considering literal-augmented KGE models and
multi-hop query answering tasks as well. The results demonstrate that the
proposed weighted averaging approach consistently improves performance across
diverse evaluation settings.

Motivation: 现实任务中的损失函数通常从初始非凸区域过渡到最优解附近的凸区域，这一性质可被利用来设计更高效的优化算法

Method: 设计两阶段优化算法：通过观察梯度范数与损失的关系检测凸性转换点，在非凸区域使用Adam，在凸区域使用共轭梯度法

Result: 计算实验证实该简单凸性结构足够频繁出现，可实际用于显著改善收敛性和精度

Conclusion: 利用损失函数从非凸到凸的转换特性设计的混合优化算法能有效提升机器学习模型的训练效率和准确性

Abstract: The key task of machine learning is to minimize the loss function that
measures the model fit to the training data. The numerical methods to do this
efficiently depend on the properties of the loss function. The most decisive
among these properties is the convexity or non-convexity of the loss function.
The fact that the loss function can have, and frequently has, non-convex
regions has led to a widespread commitment to non-convex methods such as Adam.
However, a local minimum implies that, in some environment around it, the
function is convex. In this environment, second-order minimizing methods such
as the Conjugate Gradient (CG) give a guaranteed superlinear convergence. We
propose a novel framework grounded in the hypothesis that loss functions in
real-world tasks swap from initial non-convexity to convexity towards the
optimum. This is a property we leverage to design an innovative two-phase
optimization algorithm. The presented algorithm detects the swap point by
observing the gradient norm dependence on the loss. In these regions,
non-convex (Adam) and convex (CG) algorithms are used, respectively. Computing
experiments confirm the hypothesis that this simple convexity structure is
frequent enough to be practically exploited to substantially improve
convergence and accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了生物学信息机器学习(BIML)作为物理信息机器学习(PIML)的扩展，旨在将PIML方法适应生物学的独特挑战，包括不确定先验知识、异构数据、部分可观测性和复杂网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理信息机器学习在物理领域成功应用，但生物学建模面临多面性不确定先验知识、异构噪声数据、部分可观测性和高维网络等独特挑战，需要专门的方法论。

Method: 提出BIML框架，基于四个基础支柱：不确定性量化、情境化、约束潜在结构推断和可扩展性，利用基础模型和大型语言模型作为关键赋能工具。

Result: 构建了从PIML到BIML的转型路线图，强调在生物学中应用更软、概率形式的先验知识，而非替换PIML方法。

Conclusion: BIML为生物学建模提供了原则性框架，建议建立BIML生态系统，将PIML启发的创新导向具有高科学和社会相关性的挑战。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) has successfully integrated
mechanistic understanding into machine learning, particularly in domains
governed by well-known physical laws. This success has motivated efforts to
apply PIML to biology, a field rich in dynamical systems but shaped by
different constraints. Biological modeling, however, presents unique
challenges: multi-faceted and uncertain prior knowledge, heterogeneous and
noisy data, partial observability, and complex, high-dimensional networks. In
this position paper, we argue that these challenges should not be seen as
obstacles to PIML, but as catalysts for its evolution. We propose
Biology-Informed Machine Learning (BIML): a principled extension of PIML that
retains its structural grounding while adapting to the practical realities of
biology. Rather than replacing PIML, BIML retools its methods to operate under
softer, probabilistic forms of prior knowledge. We outline four foundational
pillars as a roadmap for this transition: uncertainty quantification,
contextualization, constrained latent structure inference, and scalability.
Foundation Models and Large Language Models will be key enablers, bridging
human expertise with computational modeling. We conclude with concrete
recommendations to build the BIML ecosystem and channel PIML-inspired
innovation toward challenges of high scientific and societal relevance.

Motivation: 解决昂贵、无导数黑盒函数的全局优化问题需要极高的样本效率。传统方法如贝叶斯优化需要针对每个应用领域进行参数调优，而现有大语言模型在连续黑盒优化任务上能力有限。

Method: 通过在大规模合成数据集上微调大语言模型，这些数据集来自多样化的贝叶斯优化参数化配置，利用LLM的预训练能力实现跨优化任务的泛化。

Conclusion: GPTOpt为全局优化提供了一个无需参数调整的灵活框架，证明了LLM在连续黑盒优化任务上的潜力。

Abstract: Global optimization of expensive, derivative-free black-box functions demands
extreme sample efficiency. Classical methods such as Bayesian Optimization (BO)
can be effective, but they often require careful parameter tuning to each
application domain. At the same time, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
broad capabilities, yet state-of-the-art models remain limited in solving
continuous black-box optimization tasks. We introduce GPTOpt, an LLM-based
optimization method that equips LLMs with continuous black-box optimization
capabilities. By fine-tuning large language models on extensive synthetic
datasets derived from diverse BO parameterizations, GPTOpt leverages LLM
pre-training to generalize across optimization tasks. On a variety of black-box
optimization benchmarks, GPTOpt surpasses traditional optimizers, highlighting
the capacity of LLMs for advanced numerical reasoning and introducing a
flexible framework for global optimization without parameter tuning.

Conclusion: 效用校准提供了一个通用的、可扩展的框架来评估多类分类器的校准，支持更全面的校准评估和更丰富的下游应用。

Abstract: Ensuring that classifiers are well-calibrated, i.e., their predictions align
with observed frequencies, is a minimal and fundamental requirement for
classifiers to be viewed as trustworthy. Existing methods for assessing
multiclass calibration often focus on specific aspects associated with
prediction (e.g., top-class confidence, class-wise calibration) or utilize
computationally challenging variational formulations. In this work, we study
scalable \emph{evaluation} of multiclass calibration. To this end, we propose
utility calibration, a general framework that measures the calibration error
relative to a specific utility function that encapsulates the goals or decision
criteria relevant to the end user. We demonstrate how this framework can unify
and re-interpret several existing calibration metrics, particularly allowing
for more robust versions of the top-class and class-wise calibration metrics,
and, going beyond such binarized approaches, toward assessing calibration for
richer classes of downstream utilities.

Result: 实验表明GWA能准确预测最优早停点、支持有原则的模型比较、识别有影响力的训练样本，提供了一种无需验证集的模型分析方法。

Conclusion: GWA是一种直接从训练数据中分析模型的有效方法，能够跟踪泛化性能并归因到单个样本，为深度学习训练提供了新的监控工具。

Abstract: Robust validation metrics remain essential in contemporary deep learning, not
only to detect overfitting and poor generalization, but also to monitor
training dynamics. In the supervised classification setting, we investigate
whether interactions between training data and model weights can yield such a
metric that both tracks generalization during training and attributes
performance to individual training samples. We introduce Gradient-Weight
Alignment (GWA), quantifying the coherence between per-sample gradients and
model weights. We show that effective learning corresponds to coherent
alignment, while misalignment indicates deteriorating generalization. GWA is
efficiently computable during training and reflects both sample-specific
contributions and dataset-wide learning dynamics. Extensive experiments show
that GWA accurately predicts optimal early stopping, enables principled model
comparisons, and identifies influential training samples, providing a
validation-set-free approach for model analysis directly from the training
data.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI is growing in popularity thanks to its ability to combine
neural perception and symbolic reasoning in end-to-end trainable models.
However, recent findings reveal these are prone to shortcut reasoning, i.e., to
learning unindented concepts--or neural predicates--which exploit spurious
correlations to satisfy the symbolic constraints. In this paper, we address
reasoning shortcuts at their root cause and we introduce prototypical
neurosymbolic architectures. These models are able to satisfy the symbolic
constraints (be right) because they have learnt the correct basic concepts (for
the right reasons) and not because of spurious correlations, even in extremely
low data regimes. Leveraging the theory of prototypical learning, we
demonstrate that we can effectively avoid reasoning shortcuts by training the
models to satisfy the background knowledge while taking into account the
similarity of the input with respect to the handful of labelled datapoints. We
extensively validate our approach on the recently proposed rsbench benchmark
suite in a variety of settings and tasks with very scarce supervision: we show
significant improvements in learning the right concepts both in synthetic tasks
(MNIST-EvenOdd and Kand-Logic) and real-world, high-stake ones (BDD-OIA). Our
findings pave the way to prototype grounding as an effective,
annotation-efficient strategy for safe and reliable neurosymbolic learning.

Abstract: Foundation models for zero-shot time series forecasting face challenges in
efficient long-horizon prediction and reproducibility, with existing
synthetic-only approaches underperforming on challenging benchmarks. This paper
presents TempoPFN, a univariate time series foundation model based on linear
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) pre-trained exclusively on synthetic data. The
model uses a GatedDeltaProduct architecture with state-weaving for fully
parallelizable training across sequence lengths, eliminating the need for
windowing or summarization techniques while maintaining robust temporal
state-tracking. Our comprehensive synthetic data pipeline unifies diverse
generators, including stochastic differential equations, Gaussian processes,

Gift-Eval benchmark, TempoPFN achieves top-tier competitive performance,
outperforming all existing synthetic-only approaches and surpassing the vast

existing baselines by leveraging fully parallelizable training and inference.
We open-source our complete data generation pipeline and training code,
providing a reproducible foundation for future research.

cross-validation using the determination coefficient (R2). Among the models
tested, SVM achieved the highest predictive performance (R2 = 0.84) and was
statistically superior to KNN and Random Forest based on paired $t$-tests. To
ensure practical applicability, an interactive interface was developed using
Streamlit, allowing non-technical users to input data and receive burnout risk
predictions. The results highlight the potential of machine learning to support
early detection of burnout and promote data-driven mental health strategies in
organizational settings.

Conclusion: 提出的模型内在概念解释方法在忠实性、一致性和可解释性方面优于现有方法，且不牺牲模型性能。

Abstract: Deep networks have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks,
yet getting a global concept-level understanding of how they function remains a
key challenge. Many post-hoc concept-based approaches have been introduced to
understand their workings, yet they are not always faithful to the model.
Further, they make restrictive assumptions on the concepts a model learns, such
as class-specificity, small spatial extent, or alignment to human expectations.
In this work, we put emphasis on the faithfulness of such concept-based
explanations and propose a new model with model-inherent mechanistic
concept-explanations. Our concepts are shared across classes and, from any
layer, their contribution to the logit and their input-visualization can be
faithfully traced. We also leverage foundation models to propose a new
concept-consistency metric, C$^2$-Score, that can be used to evaluate
concept-based methods. We show that, compared to prior work, our concepts are
quantitatively more consistent and users find our concepts to be more
interpretable, all while retaining competitive ImageNet performance.

Conclusion: 提出的KG-MI目标函数结合多头注意力机制，能够可证明地从数据中恢复通用DAG的图结构，实验验证了理论结果。

Abstract: Uncovering hidden graph structures underlying real-world data is a critical
challenge with broad applications across scientific domains. Recently,
transformer-based models leveraging the attention mechanism have demonstrated
strong empirical success in capturing complex dependencies within graphs.
However, the theoretical understanding of their training dynamics has been
limited to tree-like graphs, where each node depends on a single parent.
Extending provable guarantees to more general directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) --
which involve multiple parents per node -- remains challenging, primarily due
to the difficulty in designing training objectives that enable different
attention heads to separately learn multiple different parent relationships.
  In this work, we address this problem by introducing a novel
information-theoretic metric: the kernel-guided mutual information (KG-MI),
based on the $f$-divergence. Our objective combines KG-MI with a multi-head
attention framework, where each head is associated with a distinct marginal
transition kernel to model diverse parent-child dependencies effectively. We
prove that, given sequences generated by a $K$-parent DAG, training a
single-layer, multi-head transformer via gradient ascent converges to the
global optimum in polynomial time. Furthermore, we characterize the attention
score patterns at convergence. In addition, when particularizing the
$f$-divergence to the KL divergence, the learned attention scores accurately
reflect the ground-truth adjacency matrix, thereby provably recovering the
underlying graph structure. Experimental results validate our theoretical
findings.

Conclusion: 这是第一个基于量子操作并在广泛序列学习任务中实现与经典基线竞争性能的模型，为量子机器学习开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We present a hybrid quantum-classical recurrent neural network (QRNN)
architecture in which the entire recurrent core is realized as a parametrized
quantum circuit (PQC) controlled by a classical feedforward network. The hidden
state is the quantum state of an $n$-qubit PQC, residing in an exponentially
large Hilbert space $\mathbb{C}^{2^n}$. The PQC is unitary by construction,
making the hidden-state evolution norm-preserving without external constraints.
At each timestep, mid-circuit readouts are combined with the input embedding
and processed by the feedforward network, which provides explicit classical
nonlinearity. The outputs parametrize the PQC, which updates the hidden state
via unitary dynamics. The QRNN is compact and physically consistent, and it
unifies (i) unitary recurrence as a high-capacity memory, (ii) partial
observation via mid-circuit measurements, and (iii) nonlinear classical control
for input-conditioned parametrization. We evaluate the model in simulation with
up to 14 qubits on sentiment analysis, MNIST, permuted MNIST, copying memory,
and language modeling, adopting projective measurements as a limiting case to
obtain mid-circuit readouts while maintaining a coherent recurrent quantum
memory. We further devise a soft attention mechanism over the mid-circuit
readouts in a sequence-to-sequence model and show its effectiveness for machine
translation. To our knowledge, this is the first model (RNN or otherwise)
grounded in quantum operations to achieve competitive performance against
strong classical baselines across a broad class of sequence-learning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值海洋预报模型计算成本高、可扩展性有限，需要开发更高效的数据驱动方法来进行海洋变量预测。

Method: 采用分阶段微调过程，结合纬度加权误差指标和超参数优化，将预训练的大气预报模型Aurora适配到海洋数据。

Result: 模型在加那利上升流系统取得了0.119K的低RMSE和约0.997的高异常相关系数，能成功再现大尺度SST结构。

Conclusion: 证明了跨领域预训练深度学习模型在海洋预报中的可行性，为数据驱动的海洋预测提供了新途径。

Abstract: The accurate prediction of oceanographic variables is crucial for
understanding climate change, managing marine resources, and optimizing
maritime activities. Traditional ocean forecasting relies on numerical models;
however, these approaches face limitations in terms of computational cost and
scalability. In this study, we adapt Aurora, a foundational deep learning model
originally designed for atmospheric forecasting, to predict sea surface
temperature (SST) in the Canary Upwelling System. By fine-tuning this model
with high-resolution oceanographic reanalysis data, we demonstrate its ability
to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns while reducing computational
demands. Our methodology involves a staged fine-tuning process, incorporating
latitude-weighted error metrics and optimizing hyperparameters for efficient
learning. The experimental results show that the model achieves a low RMSE of
0.119K, maintaining high anomaly correlation coefficients (ACC $\approx
0.997$). The model successfully reproduces large-scale SST structures but faces
challenges in capturing finer details in coastal regions. This work contributes
to the field of data-driven ocean forecasting by demonstrating the feasibility
of using deep learning models pre-trained in different domains for oceanic
applications. Future improvements include integrating additional oceanographic
variables, increasing spatial resolution, and exploring physics-informed neural
networks to enhance interpretability and understanding. These advancements can
improve climate modeling and ocean prediction accuracy, supporting
decision-making in environmental and economic sectors.

*Benjamin Leblanc,Pascal Germain*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一框架，从随机PAC-Bayesian保证中提取单个假设的保证，解决了经典PAC-Bayes只能提供随机采样假设期望风险保证的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典PAC-Bayes框架只能提供随机采样假设的期望风险保证，这需要测试时的随机预测，使得PAC-Bayes在许多需要部署单个确定性假设的实际场景中无法使用。

Method: 提出了一个统一框架，包括一般oracle边界，从中推导出数值边界和多数投票的特化版本。

Result: 经验表明，该方法在确定性分类器的泛化边界方面始终优于流行基线（最多可达2倍）。

Conclusion: 该框架成功地将随机PAC-Bayesian保证转化为单个确定性假设的保证，显著改进了确定性分类器的泛化边界性能。

Abstract: PAC-Bayes is a popular and efficient framework for obtaining generalization
guarantees in situations involving uncountable hypothesis spaces.
Unfortunately, in its classical formulation, it only provides guarantees on the
expected risk of a randomly sampled hypothesis. This requires stochastic
predictions at test time, making PAC-Bayes unusable in many practical
situations where a single deterministic hypothesis must be deployed. We propose
a unified framework to extract guarantees holding for a single hypothesis from
stochastic PAC-Bayesian guarantees. We present a general oracle bound and
derive from it a numerical bound and a specialization to majority vote. We
empirically show that our approach consistently outperforms popular baselines
(by up to a factor of 2) when it comes to generalization bounds on
deterministic classifiers.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Orlicz几何结构的广义Sobolev IPM方法，通过Musielak正则化将复杂优化问题简化为单变量优化，显著提高了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Sobolev IPM方法受限于L^p几何结构，无法融入其他结构先验，需要更灵活的几何结构框架。

Method: 通过Orlicz几何结构推广Sobolev IPM，建立Orlicz-Sobolev范数与Musielak范数的理论联系，利用图结构将优化问题简化为单变量优化。

Result: GSI-M方法比流行的OW方法快几个数量级，在文档分类和拓扑数据分析任务中表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 提出的广义Sobolev IPM框架突破了L^p几何限制，通过有效的正则化实现了计算效率的大幅提升，在多个实际应用中验证了其优势。

Abstract: We study the Sobolev IPM problem for measures supported on a graph metric
space, where critic function is constrained to lie within the unit ball defined
by Sobolev norm. While Le et al. (2025) achieved scalable computation by
relating Sobolev norm to weighted $L^p$-norm, the resulting framework remains
intrinsically bound to $L^p$ geometric structure, limiting its ability to
incorporate alternative structural priors beyond the $L^p$ geometry paradigm.
To overcome this limitation, we propose to generalize Sobolev IPM through the
lens of \emph{Orlicz geometric structure}, which employs convex functions to
capture nuanced geometric relationships, building upon recent advances in
optimal transport theory -- particularly Orlicz-Wasserstein (OW) and
generalized Sobolev transport -- that have proven instrumental in advancing
machine learning methodologies. This generalization encompasses classical
Sobolev IPM as a special case while accommodating diverse geometric priors
beyond traditional $L^p$ structure. It however brings up significant
computational hurdles that compound those already inherent in Sobolev IPM. To
address these challenges, we establish a novel theoretical connection between
Orlicz-Sobolev norm and Musielak norm which facilitates a novel regularization
for the generalized Sobolev IPM (GSI). By further exploiting the underlying
graph structure, we show that GSI with Musielak regularization (GSI-M) reduces
to a simple \emph{univariate optimization} problem, achieving remarkably
computational efficiency. Empirically, GSI-M is several-order faster than the
popular OW in computation, and demonstrates its practical advantages in
comparing probability measures on a given graph for document classification and
several tasks in topological data analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于SVD分解的结构化局部学习框架，在低秩流形上训练深度神经网络，减少可训练参数数量，同时保持与反向传播相当的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反向传播需要全局误差传播和全参数化，内存和计算开销大；直接反馈对齐虽然支持局部并行更新，但在深层架构中可扩展性差，特别是在卷积神经网络中。

Method: 在SVD分解的权重矩阵低秩流形上训练，对SVD分量应用包含交叉熵、子空间对齐和正交正则化的复合损失函数更新，构建匹配SVD结构的反馈矩阵。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet数据集上达到与反向传播相当的准确率，减少了可训练参数数量，无需依赖剪枝或后处理压缩。

Conclusion: 低秩流形上的局部学习为全秩梯度训练提供了一个原则性和可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) with backpropagation (BP) achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy but requires global error propagation and full
parameterization, leading to substantial memory and computational overhead.
Direct Feedback Alignment (DFA) enables local, parallelizable updates with
lower memory requirements but is limited by unstructured feedback and poor
scalability in deeper architectures, specially convolutional neural networks.
To address these limitations, we propose a structured local learning framework
that operates directly on low-rank manifolds defined by the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) of weight matrices. Each layer is trained in its decomposed
form, with updates applied to the SVD components using a composite loss that
integrates cross-entropy, subspace alignment, and orthogonality regularization.
Feedback matrices are constructed to match the SVD structure, ensuring
consistent alignment between forward and feedback pathways. Our method reduces
the number of trainable parameters relative to the original DFA model, without
relying on pruning or post hoc compression. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and ImageNet show that our method achieves accuracy comparable to that of BP.
Ablation studies confirm the importance of each loss term in the low-rank
setting. These results establish local learning on low-rank manifolds as a
principled and scalable alternative to full-rank gradient-based training.

TL;DR: 提出了基于核评分规则的回归任务不确定性量化框架，统一了现有方法并提供了设计新度量的原则性方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 回归任务在安全关键领域需要适当的不确定性量化，但现有文献主要集中在分类任务上

Method: 基于适当评分规则（特别是核评分）构建了总不确定性、偶然不确定性和认知不确定性的度量家族

Result: 实验证明这些度量在下游任务中有效，并揭示了不同实例化之间的权衡（如鲁棒性和分布外检测性能）

Conclusion: 该框架为任务特定的不确定性度量设计提供了具体指导原则

Abstract: Regression tasks, notably in safety-critical domains, require proper
uncertainty quantification, yet the literature remains largely
classification-focused. In this light, we introduce a family of measures for
total, aleatoric, and epistemic uncertainty based on proper scoring rules, with
a particular emphasis on kernel scores. The framework unifies several
well-known measures and provides a principled recipe for designing new ones
whose behavior, such as tail sensitivity, robustness, and out-of-distribution
responsiveness, is governed by the choice of kernel. We prove explicit
correspondences between kernel-score characteristics and downstream behavior,
yielding concrete design guidelines for task-specific measures. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that these measures are effective in downstream tasks
and reveal clear trade-offs among instantiations, including robustness and
out-of-distribution detection performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统比较了浮点(FP)和整数(INT)量化格式在不同粒度下的性能差异，发现在粗粒度量化中FP表现更优，但在细粒度量化中INT格式(特别是MXINT8)在算法精度和硬件效率方面更胜一筹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI硬件趋势是采用低精度浮点格式处理LLM中的激活异常值，但缺乏对FP和INT量化在不同粒度下的统一比较，导致算法和硬件协同设计缺乏明确指导。

Method: 系统研究FP和INT格式在不同粒度下的权衡，包括8位和4位格式的比较，引入对称裁剪方法解决细粒度低比特INT训练中的梯度偏差问题，并应用Hadamard旋转等异常值缓解技术。

Result: 对于8位细粒度格式，MXINT8在算法精度和硬件效率上都优于其FP对应物；对于4位格式，FP通常具有精度优势，但当应用Hadamard旋转等技术时，NVINT4可以超越NVFP4。对称裁剪方法使MXINT8训练几乎无损。

Conclusion: 一刀切的FP方法并非最优，细粒度INT格式(特别是MXINT8)为未来AI加速器提供了更好的精度、功耗和效率平衡。

Abstract: Modern AI hardware, such as Nvidia's Blackwell architecture, is increasingly
embracing low-precision floating-point (FP) formats to handle the pervasive
activation outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite this industry
trend, a unified comparison of FP and integer (INT) quantization across varying
granularities has been missing, leaving algorithm and hardware co-design
without clear guidance. This paper fills that gap by systematically
investigating the trade-offs between FP and INT formats. We reveal a critical
performance crossover: while FP excels in coarse-grained quantization, the
comparison at fine-grained (block-wise) levels is more nuanced. Our
comprehensive comparison demonstrates that for popular 8-bit fine-grained
formats (e.g., MX with block size 32), MXINT8 is superior to its FP counterpart
in both algorithmic accuracy and hardware efficiency. However, for 4-bit
formats, FP (e.g., MXFP4, NVFP4) often holds an accuracy advantage , though we
show that NVINT4 can surpass NVFP4 when outlier-mitigation techniques like
Hadamard rotation are applied. We also introduce a symmetric clipping method
that resolves gradient bias in fine-grained low-bit INT training, enabling
nearly lossless performance for MXINT8 training. These findings challenge the
current hardware trajectory, demonstrating that a one-size-fits-all FP approach
is suboptimal and advocating that fine-grained INT formats, particularly
MXINT8, offer a better balance of accuracy, power, and efficiency for future AI
accelerators.

TL;DR: BOLT-GAN是WGAN框架的简单但有效改进，基于贝叶斯最优学习阈值(BOLT)原理，通过Lipschitz连续判别器隐式最小化不同于Wasserstein距离的度量距离，在多个图像生成基准测试中比WGAN表现更好。

Motivation: 为了解决WGAN训练稳定性问题，受贝叶斯最优学习阈值(BOLT)启发，开发更稳定有效的GAN训练框架。

Method: 在WGAN框架基础上引入BOLT原理，使用Lipschitz连续判别器，隐式最小化不同于Wasserstein距离的度量距离。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CelebA-64、LSUN Bedroom-64和LSUN Church-64四个标准图像生成基准测试中，BOLT-GAN始终优于WGAN，FID分数降低10-60%。

Conclusion: BOLT是增强GAN训练的广泛适用原则，BOLT-GAN在保持简单性的同时显著提升了训练稳定性和生成质量。

Abstract: We introduce BOLT-GAN, a simple yet effective modification of the WGAN
framework inspired by the Bayes Optimal Learning Threshold (BOLT). We show that
with a Lipschitz continuous discriminator, BOLT-GAN implicitly minimizes a
different metric distance than the Earth Mover (Wasserstein) distance and
achieves better training stability. Empirical evaluations on four standard
image generation benchmarks (CIFAR-10, CelebA-64, LSUN Bedroom-64, and LSUN
Church-64) show that BOLT-GAN consistently outperforms WGAN, achieving 10-60%
lower Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Our results suggest that BOLT is a
broadly applicable principle for enhancing GAN training.

Conclusion: 阐明了动作微调与VL表示退化之间的权衡关系，并提出了恢复继承VL能力的实用方法。

Abstract: The growing success of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models stems from the
promise that pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can endow agents with
transferable world knowledge and vision-language (VL) grounding, laying a
foundation for action models with broader generalization. Yet when these VLMs
are adapted to the action modality, it remains unclear to what extent their
original VL representations and knowledge are preserved. In this work, we
conduct a systematic study of representation retention during VLA fine-tuning,
showing that naive action fine-tuning leads to degradation of visual
representations. To characterize and measure these effects, we probe VLA's
hidden representations and analyze attention maps, further, we design a set of
targeted tasks and methods that contrast VLA models with their counterpart
VLMs, isolating changes in VL capabilities induced by action fine-tuning. We
further evaluate a range of strategies for aligning visual representations and
introduce a simple yet effective method that mitigates degradation and yields
improved generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Taken together,
our analysis clarifies the trade-off between action fine-tuning and the
degradation of VL representations and highlights practical approaches to
recover inherited VL capabilities. Code is publicly available:

Motivation: 现有的联邦学习方法在处理互联子图时存在隐私风险或计算复杂度高的问题，需要一种既能保护隐私又具有良好可扩展性的解决方案。

Method: 利用拉普拉斯平滑在谱域中获取全局结构信息，有效捕获节点间依赖关系，同时避免交换敏感节点嵌入。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，FedLap相比现有技术实现了竞争性或更优的性能。

Conclusion: FedLap是第一个具有强隐私保证的子图联邦学习方案，在保护隐私的同时保持了良好的学习效果。

Abstract: We consider the problem of federated learning (FL) with graph-structured data
distributed across multiple clients. In particular, we address the prevalent
scenario of interconnected subgraphs, where interconnections between clients
significantly influence the learning process. Existing approaches suffer from
critical limitations, either requiring the exchange of sensitive node
embeddings, thereby posing privacy risks, or relying on
computationally-intensive steps, which hinders scalability. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FedLap, a novel framework that leverages global
structure information via Laplacian smoothing in the spectral domain to
effectively capture inter-node dependencies while ensuring privacy and
scalability. We provide a formal analysis of the privacy of FedLap,
demonstrating that it preserves privacy. Notably, FedLap is the first subgraph
FL scheme with strong privacy guarantees. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that FedLap achieves competitive or superior utility
compared to existing techniques.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) provide a powerful approach in neuroscience
to infer latent dynamics in neural populations and to generate hypotheses about
the neural computations underlying behavior. However, past work has focused on
relatively simple, input-driven, and largely deterministic behaviors - little
is known about the mechanisms that would allow RNNs to generate the richer,
spontaneous, and potentially stochastic behaviors observed in natural settings.
Modeling with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) has revealed a segmentation of
natural behaviors into discrete latent states with stochastic transitions
between them, a type of dynamics that may appear at odds with the continuous
state spaces implemented by RNNs. Here we first show that RNNs can replicate
HMM emission statistics and then reverse-engineer the trained networks to
uncover the mechanisms they implement. In the absence of inputs, the activity
of trained RNNs collapses towards a single fixed point. When driven by
stochastic input, trajectories instead exhibit noise-sustained dynamics along
closed orbits. Rotation along these orbits modulates the emission probabilities
and is governed by transitions between regions of slow, noise-driven dynamics
connected by fast, deterministic transitions. The trained RNNs develop highly
structured connectivity, with a small set of "kick neurons" initiating
transitions between these regions. This mechanism emerges during training as
the network shifts into a regime of stochastic resonance, enabling it to
perform probabilistic computations. Analyses across multiple HMM architectures
- fully connected, cyclic, and linear-chain - reveal that this solution
generalizes through the modular reuse of the same dynamical motif, suggesting a
compositional principle by which RNNs can emulate complex discrete latent
dynamics.

Conclusion: 具有物理一致性更新规则的局部保持图神经网络是动态波主导结构模拟的竞争性替代方案，实现了显著的推理加速同时保持时空保真度。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been explored as surrogate models
for numerical simulations. While their applications in computational fluid
dynamics have been investigated, little attention has been given to structural
problems, especially for dynamic cases. To address this gap, we introduce the
Graph Network-based Structural Simulator (GNSS), a GNN framework for surrogate
modeling of dynamic structural problems.
  GNSS follows the encode-process-decode paradigm typical of GNN-based machine
learning models, and its design makes it particularly suited for dynamic
simulations thanks to three key features: (i) expressing node kinematics in
node-fixed local frames, which avoids catastrophic cancellation in
finite-difference velocities; (ii) employing a sign-aware regression loss,
which reduces phase errors in long rollouts; and (iii) using a
wavelength-informed connectivity radius, which optimizes graph construction.
  We evaluate GNSS on a case study involving a beam excited by a 50kHz
Hanning-modulated pulse. The results show that GNSS accurately reproduces the
physics of the problem over hundreds of timesteps and generalizes to unseen
loading conditions, where existing GNNs fail to converge or deliver meaningful
predictions.
  Compared with explicit finite element baselines, GNSS achieves substantial
inference speedups while preserving spatial and temporal fidelity. These
findings demonstrate that locality-preserving GNNs with physics-consistent
update rules are a competitive alternative for dynamic, wave-dominated
structural simulations.

Motivation: 传统RNN在处理长序列时容易丢失局部细节，现有的SpikGRU方法无法有效捕捉事件驱动的时空数据中的细粒度局部依赖关系。

Method: 设计卷积脉冲GRU单元，利用卷积操作保持局部结构，同时整合脉冲神经元的时间精度和GRU的高效门控机制。

Result: 在时序数据集（NTIDIGITS、SHD）和时空基准测试（MNIST、DVSGesture、CIFAR10DVS）上表现优异，平均比最先进的GRU变体提升4.35%，在MNIST上达到99.31%准确率，比SpikGRU效率高69%。

Conclusion: CS-GRU是一个多功能架构，在时序和时空数据处理方面都表现出色，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Spike-based temporal messaging enables SNNs to efficiently process both
purely temporal and spatio-temporal time-series or event-driven data. Combining
SNNs with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), a variant of recurrent neural networks,
gives rise to a robust framework for sequential data processing; however,
traditional RNNs often lose local details when handling long sequences.
Previous approaches, such as SpikGRU, fail to capture fine-grained local
dependencies in event-based spatio-temporal data. In this paper, we introduce
the Convolutional Spiking GRU (CS-GRU) cell, which leverages convolutional
operations to preserve local structure and dependencies while integrating the
temporal precision of spiking neurons with the efficient gating mechanisms of
GRUs. This versatile architecture excels on both temporal datasets (NTIDIGITS,
SHD) and spatio-temporal benchmarks (MNIST, DVSGesture, CIFAR10DVS). Our
experiments show that CS-GRU outperforms state-of-the-art GRU variants by an
average of 4.35%, achieving over 90% accuracy on sequential tasks and up to
99.31% on MNIST. It is worth noting that our solution achieves 69% higher
efficiency compared to SpikGRU. The code is available at:

Abstract: With the recent growth of Deep Learning for AI, there is a need for tools to
meet the demand of data flowing into those models. In some cases, source data
may exist in multiple formats, and therefore the source data must be
investigated and properly engineered for a Machine Learning model or graph
database. Overhead and lack of scalability with existing workflows limit
integration within a larger processing pipeline such as Apache Airflow, driving
the need for a robust, extensible, and lightweight tool to preprocess arbitrary
datasets that scales with data type and size. To address this, we present
Machine Learning Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis, MLPrE, in which
SparkDataFrames were utilized to hold data during processing and ensure
scalability. A generalizable JSON input file format was utilized to describe
stepwise changes to that DataFrame. Stages were implemented for input and
output, filtering, basic statistics, feature engineering, and exploratory data
analysis. A total of 69 stages were implemented into MLPrE, of which we
highlight and demonstrate key stages using six diverse datasets. We further
highlight MLPrE's ability to independently process multiple fields in flat
files and recombine them, otherwise requiring an additional pipeline, using a
UniProt glossary term dataset. Building on this advantage, we demonstrated the
clustering stage with available wine quality data. Lastly, we demonstrate the
preparation of data for a graph database in the final stages of MLPrE using
phosphosite kinase data. Overall, our MLPrE tool offers a generalizable and
scalable tool for preprocessing and early data analysis, filling a critical
need for such a tool given the ever expanding use of machine learning. This

### [261] [Synthetic Data Reveals Generalization Gaps in Correlated Multiple Instance Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25759)
*Ethan Harvey,Dennis Johan Loevlie,Michael C. Hughes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文分析了传统多实例学习（MIL）方法在处理医学图像时忽略实例间上下文关系的局限性，并通过合成分类任务展示了现有方法的性能不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MIL方法在处理医学图像时将实例（如切片或补丁）独立处理，忽略了相邻实例间的上下文关系，这在真实应用中可能至关重要。

Method: 设计了一个合成分类任务，其中考虑相邻实例特征对准确预测至关重要，并将现成MIL方法与可获得闭式解的最优贝叶斯估计器进行性能对比。

Result: 实证表明，即使是较新的相关MIL方法在从数万个实例从头训练时，仍难以达到最佳泛化性能。

Conclusion: 当前MIL方法在处理需要利用实例间上下文关系的任务时存在明显局限性，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) is often used in medical imaging to classify
high-resolution 2D images by processing patches or classify 3D volumes by
processing slices. However, conventional MIL approaches treat instances
separately, ignoring contextual relationships such as the appearance of nearby
patches or slices that can be essential in real applications. We design a
synthetic classification task where accounting for adjacent instance features
is crucial for accurate prediction. We demonstrate the limitations of
off-the-shelf MIL approaches by quantifying their performance compared to the
optimal Bayes estimator for this task, which is available in closed-form. We
empirically show that newer correlated MIL methods still struggle to generalize
as well as possible when trained from scratch on tens of thousands of
instances.

### [262] [Neural Stochastic Flows: Solver-Free Modelling and Inference for SDE Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25769)
*Naoki Kiyohara,Edward Johns,Yingzhen Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出神经随机流(NSFs)及其潜在变体，通过条件归一化流直接学习SDE转移规律，实现任意时间点的一步采样，相比传统数值方法可获得两个数量级的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统随机微分方程(SDEs)建模噪声和不规则采样时间序列时，需要昂贵的数值求解器在任意时间点之间采样，计算成本高。

Method: 使用带有架构约束的条件归一化流直接学习SDE转移规律，这些约束保持了从随机流继承的特性。

Result: 在合成SDE模拟和真实世界跟踪及视频数据上的实验表明，NSFs在保持与数值方法相当的分布精度的同时，显著减少了任意时间点采样的计算量。

Conclusion: NSFs为SDE建模提供了一种高效替代方案，在保持准确性的同时大幅提升采样效率。

Abstract: Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are well suited to modelling noisy
and irregularly sampled time series found in finance, physics, and machine
learning. Traditional approaches require costly numerical solvers to sample
between arbitrary time points. We introduce Neural Stochastic Flows (NSFs) and
their latent variants, which directly learn (latent) SDE transition laws using
conditional normalising flows with architectural constraints that preserve
properties inherited from stochastic flows. This enables one-shot sampling
between arbitrary states and yields up to two orders of magnitude speed-ups at
large time gaps. Experiments on synthetic SDE simulations and on real-world
tracking and video data show that NSFs maintain distributional accuracy
comparable to numerical approaches while dramatically reducing computation for
arbitrary time-point sampling.

### [263] [A Semi-Lagrangian Adaptive Rank (SLAR) Method for High-Dimensional Vlasov Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24861)
*Nanyi Zheng,William A. Sands,Daniel Hayes,Andrew J. Christlieb,Jing-Mei Qiu*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 将半拉格朗日自适应秩积分器从矩阵扩展到高维张量设置，用于求解高达六维的Vlasov模型，通过多项式重构、自适应交叉逼近和低复杂度泊松求解器实现高效计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展之前的矩阵框架工作到高维张量设置，以模拟更高维度的Vlasov模型，同时保持半拉格朗日方法的大时间步长稳定性和高精度。

Method: 使用三阶高维多项式重构、递归层次自适应交叉逼近和层次Tucker格式的低复杂度泊松求解器，结合FFT提高效率。

Result: 算法计算复杂度为O(d⁴N r³⁺⌈log₂d⌉)，克服维度灾难，在存储和时间上实现显著计算节省，能够捕捉复杂解结构。

Conclusion: 提出的高维张量算法在保持线性计算复杂度的同时，有效模拟高维Vlasov系统，为高维动力学模拟提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We extend our previous work on a semi-Lagrangian adaptive rank (SLAR)
integrator, in the finite difference framework for nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson
systems, to the general high-order tensor setting. The proposed scheme retains
the high-order accuracy of semi-Lagrangian methods, ensuring stability for
large time steps and avoiding dimensional splitting errors. The primary
contribution of this paper is the novel extension of the algorithm from the
matrix to the high-dimensional tensor setting, which enables the simulation of
Vlasov models in up to six dimensions. The key technical components include (1)
a third-order high-dimensional polynomial reconstruction that scales as
$O(d^2)$, providing a point-wise approximation of the solution at the foot of
characteristics in a semi-Lagrangian scheme; (2) a recursive hierarchical
adaptive cross approximation of high-order tensors in a hierarchical Tucker
format, characterized by a tensor tree; (3) a low-complexity Poisson solver in
the hierarchical Tucker format that leverages the FFT for efficiency. The
computed adaptive rank kinetic solutions exhibit low-rank structures within
branches of the tensor tree resulting in substantial computational savings in
both storage and time. The resulting algorithm achieves a computational
complexity of $O(d^4 N r^{3+\lceil\log_2d\rceil})$, where $N$ is the number of
grid points per dimension, $d$ is the problem dimension, and $r$ is the maximum
rank in the tensor tree, overcoming the curse of dimensionality. Through
extensive numerical tests, we demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed
algorithm and highlight its ability to capture complex solution structures
while maintaining a computational complexity that scales linearly with $N$.

*Tong Wu,Humberto Godinez,Vitaliy Gyrya,James M. Hyman*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 提出IDDA方法，通过调整非线性算子使用插值观测信息，解决稀疏传感器网络中标准nudging数据同化的不稳定性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏传感器网络只能观测系统状态的一小部分，这会破坏标准基于nudging的数据同化方法的稳定性

Method: IDDA方法不仅将观测作为强迫项，还通过插值观测信息调整非线性算子，抑制非线性效应主导时的误差放大

Result: 在Burgers流、Kuramoto-Sivashinsky动力学和二维Navier-Stokes湍流中验证，IDDA比标准插值nudging更快达到目标精度，在混沌区域保持稳定，避免非单调瞬态，参数调优需求小

Conclusion: IDDA使用标准显式时间积分，易于集成到现有仿真流程中，是受稀疏传感器覆盖限制的操作系统的实用升级方案

Abstract: Sparse sensor networks in weather and ocean modeling observe only a small
fraction of the system state, which destabilizes standard nudging-based data
assimilation. We introduce Interpolated Discrepancy Data Assimilation (IDDA),
which modifies how discrepancies enter the governing equations. Rather than
adding observations as a forcing term alone, IDDA also adjusts the nonlinear
operator using interpolated observational information. This structural change
suppresses error amplification when nonlinear effects dominate. We prove
exponential convergence under explicit conditions linking error decay to
observation spacing, nudging strength, and diffusion coefficient. The key
requirement establishes bounds on nudging strength relative to observation
spacing and diffusion, giving practitioners a clear operating window. When
observations resolve the relevant scales, error decays at a user-specified
rate. Critically, the error bound scales with the square of observation spacing
rather than through hard-to-estimate nonlinear growth rates. We validate IDDA
on Burgers flow, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky dynamics, and two-dimensional
Navier-Stokes turbulence. Across these tests, IDDA reaches target accuracy
faster than standard interpolated nudging, remains stable in chaotic regimes,
avoids non-monotone transients, and requires minimal parameter tuning. Because
IDDA uses standard explicit time integration, it fits readily into existing
simulation pipelines without specialized solvers. These properties make IDDA a
practical upgrade for operational systems constrained by sparse sensor
coverage.

Motivation: 解决Cauchy奇异积分方程在分段Holder连续系数和右端项情况下的数值近似问题，特别是当这些函数在有限点处存在跳跃不连续性时。

Result: 建立了构造的近似序列在分段Holder空间范数下收敛到方程精确解的理论，并推导了方法的收敛速率估计。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理具有跳跃不连续性的分段Holder连续函数，为Cauchy奇异积分方程的数值求解提供了可靠的理论保证和收敛性分析。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a numerical method for approximating the solution
of a Cauchy singular integral equation defined on a closed, smooth contour in
the complex plane. The coefficients and the right-hand side of the equation are
piecewise Holder continuous functions that may have a finite number of jump
discontinuities, and are given numerically at a finite set of points on the
contour. We introduce an efficient approximation scheme for piecewise Holder
continuous functions based on linear combinations of B-spline functions and
Heaviside step functions, which serves as the foundation for the proposed
collocation algorithm. We then establish the convergence of the sequence of the
constructed approximations to the exact solution of the equation in the norm of
piecewise Holder spaces and derive estimates for the convergence rate of the
method.

Conclusion: 该工作为惯性随机设置下的团簇形成提供了理论和数值方法，填补了过阻尼朗之万动力学与哈密顿极限之间的研究空白。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the formation of clusters for stochastic interacting
particle systems (SIPS) that interact through short-range attractive potentials
in a periodic domain. We consider kinetic (underdamped) Langevin dynamics and
focus on the low-friction regime. Employing a linear stability analysis for the
kinetic McKean-Vlasov equation, we show that, at sufficiently low temperatures,
and for sufficiently short-ranged interactions, the particles form clusters
that correspond to metastable states of the mean-field dynamics. We derive the
friction and particle-count dependent cluster-formation time and numerically
measure the friction-dependent times to reach a stationary state (given by a
state in which all particles are bound in a single cluster). By providing both
theory and numerical methods in the inertial stochastic setting, this work acts
as a bridge between cluster formation studies in overdamped Langevin dynamics
and the Hamiltonian (microcanonical) limit.

Conclusion: 该深度学习框架为哈密顿系统的长时间和系综模拟提供了高效解决方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Hamiltonian systems with multiple timescales arise in molecular dynamics,
classical mechanics, and theoretical physics. Long-time numerical integration
of such systems requires resolving fast dynamics with very small time steps,
which incurs a high computational cost - especially in ensemble simulations for
uncertainty quantification, sensitivity analysis, or varying initial
conditions. We present a Deep Learning framework that learns the flow maps of
Hamiltonian systems to accelerate long-time and ensemble simulations. Neural
networks are trained, according to a chosen numerical scheme, either entirely
without data to approximate flows over large time intervals or with data to
learn flows in intervals far from the initial time. For the latter, we propose
a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo-based data generator. The architecture consists of
simple feedforward networks that incorporate truncated Taylor expansions of the
flow map, with a neural network remainder capturing unresolved effects. Applied
to benchmark non-integrable and non-canonical systems, the method achieves
substantial speedups while preserving accuracy, enabling scalable simulation of
complex Hamiltonian dynamics.

TL;DR: 本文推导了具有一般连通性泛函的ε图的能量基连续极限，证明了离散能量与连续对应物最多相差O(ε)，误差界限在连通密度存在强局部波动时仍然有效。应用包括通过神经网络从边权重数据重建连通密度，并将其嵌入脑动力学框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ε图的连续极限，旨在建立离散图能量与连续模型之间的精确对应关系，特别是在连通密度存在局部波动的情况下保持误差界限的有效性。

Method: 推导能量基连续极限，证明离散与连续能量之间的误差界限为O(ε)，开发神经网络程序从边权重数据重建连通密度，并将结果嵌入脑动力学框架。

Result: 离散能量与连续对应物的误差最多为O(ε)，误差界限仅涉及连通密度的W^{1,1}范数，在强局部波动下仍然有效。神经网络成功重建连通密度，产生空间变化的扩散系数。

Conclusion: 该方法为图结构提供了精确的连续极限描述，并在脑动力学应用中展示了与常扩散系数模型显著不同的动态行为，验证了空间变化连通性的重要性。

Abstract: We derive an energy-based continuum limit for $\varepsilon$-graphs endowed
with a general connectivity functional. We prove that the discrete energy and
its continuum counterpart differ by at most $O(\varepsilon)$; the prefactor
involves only the $W^{1,1}$-norm of the connectivity density as
$\varepsilon\to0$, so the error bound remains valid even when that density has
strong local fluctuations. As an application, we introduce a neural-network
procedure that reconstructs the connectivity density from edge-weight data and
then embeds the resulting continuum model into a brain-dynamics framework. In
this setting, the usual constant diffusion coefficient is replaced by the
spatially varying coefficient produced by the learned density, yielding
dynamics that differ significantly from those obtained with conventional
constant-diffusion models.

Motivation: 开发高精度数值方法求解LLG方程，同时保持其关键物理性质（正则化约束），并平衡计算效率与数值稳定性。

Method: 空间上采用长模板有限差分法实现四阶精度，边界处使用高阶泰勒展开；时间上基于三阶后向差分公式(BDF3)，线性扩散项隐式离散，非线性项显式外推。

Result: 理论分析证实该格式在ℓ∞([0,T],ℓ²)和ℓ²([0,T],H_h¹)范数下具有最优收敛率，数值实验验证了理论收敛结果。

Conclusion: 所提出的数值格式成功实现了高精度求解LLG方程，保持了物理约束，理论分析与数值结果一致。

Abstract: This work proposes and analyzes a fully discrete numerical scheme for solving
the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, which achieves fourth-order spatial
accuracy and third-order temporal accuracy.Spatially, fourth-order accuracy is
attained through the adoption of a long-stencil finite difference method, while
boundary extrapolation is executed by leveraging a higher-order Taylor
expansion to ensure consistency at domain boundaries. Temporally, the scheme is
constructed based on the third-order backward differentiation formula (BDF3),
with implicit discretization applied to the linear diffusion term for numerical
stability and explicit extrapolation employed for nonlinear terms to balance
computational efficiency. Notably, this numerical method inherently preserves
the normalization constraint of the LLG equation, a key physical property of
the system.Theoretical analysis confirms that the proposed scheme exhibits
optimal convergence rates under the \(\ell^{\infty}([0,T],\ell^2)\) and
\(\ell^2([0,T],H_h^1)\) norms. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to
validate the correctness of the theoretical convergence results, demonstrating
good agreement between numerical observations and analytical conclusions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kronecker乘积是大型网络和矩阵数据稀疏表示的重要工具，但在某些情况下，大型矩阵的稀疏模式可能本身就隐藏着Kronecker乘积结构。本文旨在确定二元矩阵的所有可能Kronecker分解，以支持后续的近似分解和网络结构分析。

Method: 通过分解图可视化二元矩阵的所有可能Kronecker分解，确定其所有可能的分解方式。

Result: 开发了二元矩阵Kronecker分解的完整理论框架，能够识别所有可能的分解模式，并为Kronecker图提供自然可视化方法。

Conclusion: 这种基于稀疏模式的分解方法能够为实矩阵的良好近似Kronecker分解提供基础，同时揭示网络的潜在结构，为Kronecker图提供直观的可视化表示。

Abstract: The Kronecker product is an invaluable tool for data-sparse representations
of large networks and matrices with countless applications in machine learning,
graph theory and numerical linear algebra. In some instances, the sparsity
pattern of large matrices may already hide a Kronecker product. Similarly, a
large network, represented by its adjacency matrix, may sometimes be factorized
as a Kronecker product of smaller adjacency matrices. In this article, we
determine all possible Kronecker factorizations of a binary matrix and
visualize them through its decomposition graph. Such sparsity-informed
factorizations may later enable good (approximate) Kronecker factorizations of
real matrices or reveal the latent structure of a network. The latter also
suggests a natural visualization of Kronecker graphs.

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了拉格朗日DG方案中正性保持与高阶精度的统一，为多维双曲系统求解提供了有效的数值方法。

Abstract: We introduce a Lagrangian nodal discontinuous Galerkin (DG) cell-centered
hydrodynamics method for solving multi-dimensional hyperbolic systems. By
incorporating an adaptation of Zalesak's flux-corrected transport algorithm, we
combine a first-order positivity-preserving scheme with a higher-order target
discretization. This results in a flux-corrected Lagrangian DG scheme that
ensures both global positivity preservation and second-order accuracy for the
cell averages of specific volume. The correction factors for flux limiting are
derived from specific volume and applied to all components of the solution
vector. We algebraically evolve the volumes of mesh cells using a discrete
version of the geometric conservation law (GCL). The application of a limiter
to the GCL fluxes is equivalent to moving the mesh using limited nodal
velocities. Additionally, we equip our method with a locally bound-preserving
slope limiter to effectively suppress spurious oscillations. Nodal velocity and
external forces are computed using a multidirectional approximate Riemann
solver to maintain conservation of momentum and total energy in vertex
neighborhoods. Employing linear finite elements and a second-order accurate
time integrator guarantees GCL consistency. The results for standard test
problems demonstrate the stability and superb shock-capturing capabilities of
our scheme.

Result: 证明当尺度分离参数趋近于零时，密度估计器具有鲁棒性并收敛到同质化模型的稳态密度，前提是时间范围和傅里叶模式数量与多尺度参数适当相关。数值实验进一步验证了方法的准确性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效估计多尺度Langevin扩散过程的同质化稳态密度，在适当条件下具有理论保证和实际可行性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of density estimation in the context of multiscale
Langevin diffusion processes, where a single-scale homogenized surrogate model
can be derived. In particular, our aim is to learn the density of the invariant
measure of the homogenized dynamics from a continuous-time trajectory generated
by the full multiscale system. We propose a spectral method based on a
truncated Fourier expansion with Hermite functions as orthonormal basis. The
Fourier coefficients are computed directly from the data owing to the ergodic
theorem. We prove that the resulting density estimator is robust and converges
to the invariant density of the homogenized model as the scale separation
parameter vanishes, provided the time horizon and the number of Fourier modes
are suitably chosen in relation to the multiscale parameter. The accuracy and
reliability of this methodology is further demonstrated through a series of
numerical experiments.

Abstract: We describe an iterative algorithm to construct an unstructured tessellation

femtography, as enabled by high energy exclusive processes such as
electron-proton scattering producing just an electron, proton, and gamma-ray in
the final state. While producing tessellations with only a 1% mean
interpolation error, our results show that the use of such tessellations can
significantly decrease the computation time for Monte Carlo event generation by
$\sim23$ times for $10^{7}$ events (and using extrapolation, by $\sim955$ times

Abstract: Solving inverse and optimization problems over solutions of nonlinear partial
differential equations (PDEs) on complex spatial domains is a long-standing
challenge. Here we introduce a method that parameterizes the solution using
spectral bases on arbitrary spatiotemporal domains, whereby the basis is
defined on a hyperrectangle containing the true domain. We find the
coefficients of the basis expansion by solving an optimization problem whereby
both the equations, the boundary conditions and any optimization targets are
enforced by a loss function, building on a key idea from Physics-Informed
Neural Networks (PINNs). Since the representation of the function natively has
exponential convergence, so does the solution of the optimization problem, as
long as it can be solved efficiently. We find empirically that the optimization
protocols developed for machine learning find solutions with exponential
convergence on a wide range of equations. The method naturally allows for the
incorporation of data assimilation by including additional terms in the loss
function, and for the efficient solution of optimization problems over the PDE
solutions.
