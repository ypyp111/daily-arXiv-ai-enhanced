We trained and evaluated two types of models: baseline support vector\nmachines (SVM) and BlueBERT which is a large language model pretrained on\nPubMed abstracts and hospitalized patient data. We assessed for\ngeneralizability of our model in two ways. First, we evaluated models trained\nusing Inst.-train on SF-test. Second, we trained a BlueBERT_TRANSFER model that\nwas first fine-tuned on Inst.-train then on SF-train before testing on SF-test\nset. To further analyze model performance, we also examined a subset of 59\nreports from our Inst. dataset, which were manually edited for clarity.\n  RESULTS Classification performance on the Inst. test achieved AUROC 0.82\nusing SVM and 0.81 using BlueBERT. Without cross-institution transfer learning,\nperformance on the SF test was limited to an AUROC of 0.42 using SVM and 0.56\nusing BlueBERT.

While most prior OOD detection research in AVs has concentrated on\ncomputer vision tasks such as object detection and segmentation,\ntrajectory-level OOD detection remains largely underexplored. A recent study\nformulated this problem as a quickest change detection (QCD) task, providing\nformal guarantees on the trade-off between detection delay and false alarms\n[1]. Building on this foundation, we propose a new framework that introduces\nadaptive mechanisms to achieve robust detection in complex driving\nenvironments. Empirical analysis across multiple real-world datasets reveals\nthat prediction errors -- even on in-distribution samples -- exhibit\nmode-dependent distributions that evolve over time with dataset-specific\ndynamics.

While pure data-driven models offer computational efficiency,\nthey often lack generalization across scales and do not incorporate explicit\nphysical constraints. Pore network models (PNMs), on the other hand, are\nphysics-based and efficient but rely on idealized geometric assumptions to\nestimate pore-scale hydraulic conductance, limiting their accuracy in complex\nstructures. To overcome these limitations, we present an end-to-end\ndifferentiable hybrid framework that embeds a graph neural network (GNN) into a\nPNM. In this framework, the analytical formulas used for conductance\ncalculations are replaced by GNN-based predictions derived from pore and throat\nfeatures.

In this way, the model avoids the idealized geometric\nassumptions of PNM while preserving the physics-based flow calculations. The\nGNN is trained without requiring labeled conductance data, which can number in\nthe thousands per pore network; instead, it learns conductance values by using\na single scalar permeability as the training target. This is made possible by\nbackpropagating gradients through both the GNN (via automatic differentiation)\nand the PNM solver (via a discrete adjoint method), enabling fully coupled,\nend-to-end training. The resulting model achieves high accuracy and generalizes\nwell across different scales, outperforming both pure data-driven and\ntraditional PNM approaches.

However, existing approaches typically\ntreat these tasks independently, overlooking the benefits of jointly training\nGREC and GRES to ensure consistent multi-granularity predictions and streamline\nthe overall process. Moreover, current methods often treat GRES as a semantic\nsegmentation task, neglecting the crucial role of instance-aware capabilities\nand the necessity of ensuring consistent predictions between instance-level\nboxes and masks. To address these limitations, we propose InstanceVG, a\nmulti-task generalized visual grounding framework equipped with instance-aware\ncapabilities, which leverages instance queries to unify the joint and\nconsistency predictions of instance-level boxes and masks. To the best of our\nknowledge, InstanceVG is the first framework to simultaneously tackle both GREC\nand GRES while incorporating instance-aware capabilities into generalized\nvisual grounding. To instantiate the framework, we assign each instance query a\nprior reference point, which also serves as an additional basis for target\nmatching. This design facilitates consistent predictions of points, boxes, and\nmasks for the same instance.

However, purification can remove protective perturbations, thereby\nexposing images again to the risk of malicious forgery. In this work, we\nformalize the anti-purification task, highlighting challenges that hinder\nexisting approaches, and propose a simple diagnostic protective perturbation\nnamed AntiPure. AntiPure exposes vulnerabilities of purification within the\n\"purification-customization\" workflow, owing to two guidance mechanisms: 1)\nPatch-wise Frequency Guidance, which reduces the model's influence over\nhigh-frequency components in the purified image, and 2) Erroneous Timestep\nGuidance, which disrupts the model's denoising strategy across different\ntimesteps. With additional guidance, AntiPure embeds imperceptible\nperturbations that persist under representative purification settings,\nachieving effective post-customization distortion.

However, current video large language models (VLLMs) and\nbenchmarks mostly rely on low-frame-rate sampling, such as uniform sampling or\nkeyframe selection, discarding dense temporal information. This compromise\navoids the high cost of tokenizing every frame, which otherwise leads to\nredundant computation and linear token growth as video length increases. While\nthis trade-off works for slowly changing content, it fails for tasks like\nlecture comprehension, where information appears in nearly every frame and\nrequires precise temporal alignment. To address this gap, we introduce Dense\nVideo Understanding (DVU), which enables high-FPS video comprehension by\nreducing both tokenization time and token overhead. Existing benchmarks are\nalso limited, as their QA pairs focus on coarse content changes. We therefore\npropose DIVE (Dense Information Video Evaluation), the first benchmark designed\nfor dense temporal reasoning. To make DVU practical, we present Gated Residual\nTokenization (GRT), a two-stage framework: (1) Motion-Compensated Inter-Gated\nTokenization uses pixel-level motion estimation to skip static regions during\ntokenization, achieving sub-linear growth in token count and compute. (2)\nSemantic-Scene Intra-Tokenization Merging fuses tokens across static regions\nwithin a scene, further reducing redundancy while preserving dynamic semantics.\nExperiments on DIVE show that GRT outperforms larger VLLM baselines and scales\npositively with FPS. These results highlight the importance of dense temporal\ninformation and demonstrate that GRT enables efficient, scalable high-FPS video\nunderstanding."}

Existing benchmarks often test short-clip recognition or\nuse template-based questions, leaving a critical gap in evaluating fine-grained\nreasoning over long-form narrative content. To address these gaps, we introduce\n$\\mathsf{Cin\\acute{e}aste}$, a comprehensive benchmark for long-form movie\nunderstanding. Our dataset comprises 3,119 multiple-choice question-answer\npairs derived from 1,805 scenes across 200 diverse movies, spanning five novel\nfine-grained contextual reasoning categories. We use GPT-4o to generate\ndiverse, context-rich questions by integrating visual descriptions, captions,\nscene titles, and summaries, which require deep narrative understanding. To\nensure high-quality evaluation, our pipeline incorporates a two-stage filtering\nprocess: Context-Independence filtering ensures questions require video\ncontext, while Contextual Veracity filtering validates factual consistency\nagainst the movie content, mitigating hallucinations. Experiments show that\nexisting MLLMs struggle on $\\mathsf{Cin\\acute{e}aste}$; our analysis reveals\nthat long-range temporal reasoning is a primary bottleneck, with the top\nopen-source model achieving only 63.15\\% accuracy. This underscores significant\nchallenges in fine-grained contextual understanding and the need for\nadvancements in long-form movie comprehension."}

Existing exam-style\nbenchmarks mainly focus on understanding and reasoning tasks, and current\ngeneration benchmarks emphasize the illustration of world knowledge and visual\nconcepts, neglecting the evaluation of rigorous drawing exams. We introduce\nGenExam, the first benchmark for multidisciplinary text-to-image exams,\nfeaturing 1,000 samples across 10 subjects with exam-style prompts organized\nunder a four-level taxonomy. Each problem is equipped with ground-truth images\nand fine-grained scoring points to enable a precise evaluation of semantic\ncorrectness and visual plausibility. Experiments show that even\nstate-of-the-art models such as GPT-Image-1 and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image achieve\nless than 15% strict scores, and most models yield almost 0%, suggesting the\ngreat challenge of our benchmark.

Our findings demonstrate that larger models\nconsistently exhibit better uncertainty quantification; models that know more\nalso know better what they don't know.

Our framework empowers a central LLM or\nMLLM agent to intelligently orchestrate a diverse toolkit of specialized visual\ntools, including online image search, diffusion-based generation, code\nexecution, and image editing. The agent is trained to select and apply these\ntools proficiently via a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that features a\nhybrid reward system combining rule-based logic with judgments from LLM and\nMLLM evaluators. Trained on a diverse new dataset using four different model\nbackbones, LLM-I demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming\nexisting methods by a large margin across four benchmarks.
