Two-dimensional steady-state\nconvective solutions with the Frank-Kamenetskii viscosity are obtained by the\nNewton method for a number of different values of the Rayleigh number and the\nstrength of the dependence of the viscosity on temperature. By classifying the\nsolutions with the top surface mobility, we find the sluggish lid regime\nbetween the mobile and stagnant lid regimes. The solutions of the sluggish\nregime are characterized by a large viscosity contrast through the boundary\nlayer below the conductive lid and a rapid increase of the Nusselt number with\nrespect to the Rayleigh number. For most solutions in the mobile and stagnant\nlid regimes, the Nusselt number is proportional to the 1/6 power of the\nRayleigh number, which can be derived by taking into account the effect of thin\nand strong downwelling plumes. Time evolution calculations show that the steady\nsolutions become unstable for large Rayleigh numbers, where additional downward\nplumes grow on the background convective flows. This can be explained by the\ntimescale of the Rayleigh--Taylor instability for the thermal boundary layer\nbetween the conductive lid and the convective core, which is shorter than the\ntimescale of horizontal advection by the background flow. In addition, steady\nconvective solutions with Arrhenius-law viscosity are calculated for several\nvalues of the parameters.

This work examines how\npersuasion and bias interact in LLMs, focusing on how imperfect or skewed\noutputs affect persuasive impact. Specifically, we test whether persona-based\nmodels can persuade with fact-based claims while also, unintentionally,\npromoting misinformation or biased narratives.\n  We introduce a convincer-skeptic framework: LLMs adopt personas to simulate\nrealistic attitudes. Skeptic models serve as human proxies; we compare their\nbeliefs before and after exposure to arguments from convincer models.\nPersuasion is quantified with Jensen-Shannon divergence over belief\ndistributions. We then ask how much persuaded entities go on to reinforce and\namplify biased beliefs across race, gender, and religion. Strong persuaders are\nfurther probed for bias using sycophantic adversarial prompts and judged with\nadditional models.\n  Our findings show both promise and risk. LLMs can shape narratives, adapt\ntone, and mirror audience values across domains such as psychology, marketing,\nand legal assistance. But the same capacity can be weaponized to automate\nmisinformation or craft messages that exploit cognitive biases, reinforcing\nstereotypes and widening inequities. The core danger lies in misuse more than\nin occasional model mistakes. By measuring persuasive power and bias\nreinforcement, we argue for guardrails and policies that penalize deceptive use\nand support alignment, value-sensitive design, and trustworthy deployment."}

WE-PaDiM\napplies 2D DWT to feature maps from multiple backbone layers, selects specific\nfrequency subbands (e.g., LL, LH, HL), spatially aligns them, and concatenates\nthem channel-wise before modeling with PaDiM's multivariate Gaussian framework.\nThis DWT-before-concatenation strategy provides a principled method for feature\nselection based on frequency content relevant to anomalies, leveraging\nmulti-scale wavelet information as an alternative to random selection. We\nevaluate WE-PaDiM on the challenging MVTec AD dataset with multiple backbones\n(ResNet-18 and EfficientNet B0-B6). The method achieves strong performance in\nanomaly detection and localization, yielding average results of 99.32%\nImage-AUC and 92.10% Pixel-AUC across 15 categories with per-class optimized\nconfigurations. Our analysis shows that wavelet choices affect performance\ntrade-offs: simpler wavelets (e.g., Haar) with detail subbands (HL or LH/HL/HH)\noften enhance localization, while approximation bands (LL) improve image-level\ndetection. WE-PaDiM thus offers a competitive and interpretable alternative to\nrandom feature selection in PaDiM, achieving robust results suitable for\nindustrial inspection with comparable efficiency."}

Such challenges limit the final generation quality of LLM.\n  To overcome these limitations, we present a novel generative prompt\ncompression method.

While\nrecent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit\nreasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in\nLSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the\n\"Thinking-before-Speaking\" paradigm from textual models to speech. However,\nthis sequential formulation introduces notable latency, as spoken responses are\ndelayed until reasoning is fully completed, impairing real-time interaction and\ncommunication efficiency. To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a\nframework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel\n\"Thinking-in-Speaking\" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before\nproducing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning\ntokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This design allows\ncontinuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning,\nleveraging the model's high-frequency token processing capability. Although\ninterleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response\ntoken is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we\nintroduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for\ninterleaved reasoning and response.

This noise inherently affects the resulting multimodal\nrepresentations, especially when these representations are obtained through\nexplicit interactions between different modalities. Moreover, the multimodal\nfusion techniques while aiming to achieve a strong joint representation, can\nneglect valuable discriminative information within the individual modalities.\nTo this end, we propose a Multimodal-Multitask framework with crOss-modal\nRelation and hIErarchical iNteractive aTtention (MM-ORIENT) that is effective\nfor multiple tasks. The proposed approach acquires multimodal representations\ncross-modally without explicit interaction between different modalities,\nreducing the noise effect at the latent stage. To achieve this, we propose\ncross-modal relation graphs that reconstruct monomodal features to acquire\nmultimodal representations. The features are reconstructed based on the node\nneighborhood, where the neighborhood is decided by the features of a different\nmodality. We also propose Hierarchical Interactive Monomadal Attention (HIMA)\nto focus on pertinent information within a modality.

In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply,\nthese systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the\nability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this\nskill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply\nsimulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but\nthese will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically\nincorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a\nmisalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the\nreal-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable.

Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that\nperform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results\nare to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that\ndoing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data\nquality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the\nobservability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are\noften only partially observed.

To enhance the reasoning\nperformance of LLMs, diverse Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based fine-tuning\napproaches have been proposed to address the limited generalization capability\nof LLMs trained solely via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Despite their\neffectiveness, two major limitations hinder the advancement of LLMs. First,\nvanilla RL-based approaches ignore annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and\nincorporate unstable reasoning path sampling, which typically results in model\ncollapse, unstable training process, and suboptimal performance. Second,\nexisting SFT approaches generally overemphasize the annotated CoT, potentially\nleading to performance degradation due to insufficient exploitation of\npotential CoT. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive learning with annotated\nCoT-based Reinforced Fine-Tuning approach, i.e., \\TheName{}, to enhance the\nreasoning performance of LLMs while addressing the aforementioned limitations.\nSpecifically, we propose learning a representation for each CoT. Based on this\nrepresentation, we design novel contrastive signals to guide the fine-tuning\nprocess. Our approach not only fully exploits the available annotated CoT but\nalso stabilizes the fine-tuning procedure by incorporating an additional\nunsupervised learning signal. We conduct comprehensive experiments and in-depth\nanalysis with three baseline approaches, two foundation models, and two\ndatasets to demonstrate significant advantages of \\TheName{} in terms of\nrobustness, performance (up to 10.15\\%), and efficiency (up to 30.62\\%).

In this work, we investigate the\neffects of existing fine-tuning video generation approaches on structured\ndriving datasets and uncover a potential trade-off: although visual fidelity\nimproves, spatial accuracy in modeling dynamic elements may degrade. We\nattribute this degradation to a shift in the alignment between visual quality\nand dynamic understanding objectives. In datasets with diverse scene structures\nwithin temporal space, where objects or perspective shift in varied ways, these\nobjectives tend to highly correlated. However, the very regular and repetitive\nnature of driving scenes allows visual quality to improve by modeling dominant\nscene motion patterns, without necessarily preserving fine-grained dynamic\nbehavior. As a result, fine-tuning encourages the model to prioritize\nsurface-level realism over dynamic accuracy. To further examine this\nphenomenon, we show that simple continual learning strategies, such as replay\nfrom diverse domains, can offer a balanced alternative by preserving spatial\naccuracy while maintaining strong visual quality."}

In\nparticular, as a powerful evolutionary machine learning approach, Genetic\nProgramming (GP) is utilized to evolve human-understandable phase urgency\nfunctions to measure the urgency of activating a green light for a specific\nphase. However, current GP-based methods are unable to treat the common traffic\nfeatures of different traffic signal phases consistently. To address this\nissue, we propose to use a symmetric phase urgency function to calculate the\nphase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. This\nis represented as an aggregation of two shared subtrees, each representing the\nurgency of a turn movement in the phase. We then propose a GP method to evolve\nthe symmetric phase urgency function. We evaluate our proposed method on the\nwell-known cityflow traffic simulator, based on multiple public real-world\ndatasets.

SAEs approximate model embeddings as sparse linear combinations of\nlearned directions, or \"concepts\".

In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply,\nthese systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the\nability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this\nskill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply\nsimulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but\nthese will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically\nincorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a\nmisalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the\nreal-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with\nthis misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a\nproblem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with\nzero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that\nperform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results\nare to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that\ndoing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data\nquality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the\nobservability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are\noften only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a\npriori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of\nmethods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of\nempirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our\ntechniques for remedying them.

Our work shows that, to train SAEs with correct\nfeatures, practitioners must set L0 correctly."}

However, they often fail to produce out-of-domain (OOD) or rare\nconcepts, yielding inconsistent or inaccurate results. To this end, we propose\nMV-RAG, a novel text-to-3D pipeline that first retrieves relevant 2D images\nfrom a large in-the-wild 2D database and then conditions a multiview diffusion\nmodel on these images to synthesize consistent and accurate multiview outputs.\nTraining such a retrieval-conditioned model is achieved via a novel hybrid\nstrategy bridging structured multiview data and diverse 2D image collections.\nThis involves training on multiview data using augmented conditioning views\nthat simulate retrieval variance for view-specific reconstruction, alongside\ntraining on sets of retrieved real-world 2D images using a distinctive held-out\nview prediction objective: the model predicts the held-out view from the other\nviews to infer 3D consistency from 2D data. To facilitate a rigorous OOD\nevaluation, we introduce a new collection of challenging OOD prompts.\nExperiments against state-of-the-art text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and\npersonalization baselines show that our approach significantly improves 3D\nconsistency, photorealism, and text adherence for OOD/rare concepts, while\nmaintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks."}
