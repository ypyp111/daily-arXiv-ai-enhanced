Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于下一个标记概率（NTPs）的轻量级幻觉检测方法，通过训练传统机器学习模型来检测视觉语言模型（VLMs）生成的文本中的幻觉问题，该方法计算效率高且性能可与大型VLMs相媲美。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）产生的幻觉问题（视觉内容与生成文本之间的不一致）会削弱模型的可靠性。现有的检测方法通常使用相同或不同的VLM来评估生成输出，但这种方法计算量大且会增加模型延迟。

Method: 利用VLM的下一个标记概率（NTPs）作为模型不确定性的直接量化指标，假设高不确定性（即低NTP值）与幻觉密切相关。训练传统ML模型基于NTP信号进行幻觉检测，并引入语言NTPs和VLM幻觉预测分数来增强检测性能。

Result: 基于NTP的特征是有效的幻觉预测因子，使简单快速的ML模型能够达到与强大VLMs相当的性能。结合语言NTPs和VLM预测分数后，检测性能优于单独使用VLMs或NTPs。

Conclusion: 这项研究为开发简单、轻量级的解决方案铺平了道路，能够有效提高VLMs的可靠性，通过高效的在线幻觉检测方法解决了现有方法的计算瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Hallucinations of vision-language models (VLMs), which are misalignments
between visual content and generated text, undermine the reliability of VLMs.
One common approach for detecting them employs the same VLM, or a different
one, to assess generated outputs. This process is computationally intensive and
increases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly
method for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over
signals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a
direct quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high
uncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations.
To test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements
derived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and
use it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that
NTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and
simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs.
Furthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding
only the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection
performance. Finally, integrating hallucination prediction scores from VLMs
into the NTP-based models led to better performance than using either VLMs or
NTPs alone. We hope this study paves the way for simple, lightweight solutions
that enhance the reliability of VLMs.

### [2] [Quasi-Synthetic Riemannian Data Generation for Writer-Independent Offline Signature Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20420)
*Elias N. Zois,Moises Diaz,Salem Said,Miguel A. Ferrer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于黎曼几何的准合成数据生成框架，用于解决离线手写签名验证在未见个体上的泛化问题，通过在SPD矩阵空间生成合成数据来训练度量学习模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线手写签名验证在独立于书写者的设置中面临泛化挑战，现有方法依赖真实签名数据集进行训练，限制了模型在未见个体上的性能。

Method: 利用SPD矩阵的黎曼几何，通过Riemannian Gaussian Mixture模型从少量真实样本生成合成书写者和签名特征，然后使用度量学习框架训练相似性判别模型。

Result: 在包含西方和亚洲书写风格的两个流行签名数据集上的实验表明，该方法在数据集内和跨数据集评估协议下都能实现低错误率。

Conclusion: 该准合成方法展示了在黎曼空间中生成合成数据对于独立于书写者的签名验证系统的潜力，为解决数据稀缺问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Offline handwritten signature verification remains a challenging task,
particularly in writer-independent settings where models must generalize across
unseen individuals. Recent developments have highlighted the advantage of
geometrically inspired representations, such as covariance descriptors on
Riemannian manifolds. However, past or present, handcrafted or data-driven
methods usually depend on real-world signature datasets for classifier
training. We introduce a quasi-synthetic data generation framework leveraging
the Riemannian geometry of Symmetric Positive Definite matrices (SPD). A small
set of genuine samples in the SPD space is the seed to a Riemannian Gaussian
Mixture which identifies Riemannian centers as synthetic writers and variances
as their properties. Riemannian Gaussian sampling on each center generates
positive as well as negative synthetic SPD populations. A metric learning
framework utilizes pairs of similar and dissimilar SPD points, subsequently
testing it over on real-world datasets. Experiments conducted on two popular
signature datasets, encompassing Western and Asian writing styles, demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed approach under both intra- and cross- dataset
evaluation protocols. The results indicate that our quasi-synthetic approach
achieves low error rates, highlighting the potential of generating synthetic
data in Riemannian spaces for writer-independent signature verification
systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seedream 4.0是一个高效的多模态图像生成系统，统一了文本到图像合成、图像编辑和多图像组合功能，通过优化的扩散变换器和VAE实现快速高分辨率图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本到图像系统功能单一，缺乏交互性和多维创作能力，需要开发一个统一框架来支持复杂的多模态图像生成任务。

Method: 使用高效的扩散变换器和强大的VAE减少图像token数量，结合多模态后训练技术，集成对抗蒸馏、分布匹配、量化和推测解码等推理加速技术。

Result: 在2K图像生成上达到1.8秒的推理时间，在文本到图像和多模态图像编辑任务上达到最先进水平，支持精确图像编辑和上下文推理。

Conclusion: Seedream 4.0将传统文本到图像系统扩展为更交互和多维的创作工具，推动了生成AI在创意和专业应用中的边界。

Abstract: We introduce Seedream 4.0, an efficient and high-performance multimodal image
generation system that unifies text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, image editing,
and multi-image composition within a single framework. We develop a highly
efficient diffusion transformer with a powerful VAE which also can reduce the
number of image tokens considerably. This allows for efficient training of our
model, and enables it to fast generate native high-resolution images (e.g.,
1K-4K). Seedream 4.0 is pretrained on billions of text-image pairs spanning
diverse taxonomies and knowledge-centric concepts. Comprehensive data
collection across hundreds of vertical scenarios, coupled with optimized
strategies, ensures stable and large-scale training, with strong
generalization. By incorporating a carefully fine-tuned VLM model, we perform
multi-modal post-training for training both T2I and image editing tasks
jointly. For inference acceleration, we integrate adversarial distillation,
distribution matching, and quantization, as well as speculative decoding. It
achieves an inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for generating a 2K image
(without a LLM/VLM as PE model). Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Seedream
4.0 can achieve state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image
editing. In particular, it demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in
complex tasks, including precise image editing and in-context reasoning, and
also allows for multi-image reference, and can generate multiple output images.
This extends traditional T2I systems into an more interactive and
multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both
creativity and professional applications. Seedream 4.0 is now accessible on
https://www.volcengine.com/experience/ark?launch=seedream.

### [4] [A Contrastive Learning Framework for Breast Cancer Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20474)
*Samia Saeed,Khuram Naveed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于对比学习的框架，用于乳腺癌检测，通过半监督学习在小规模标注数据集上实现96.7%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌是全球第二大癌症死亡原因，早期检测对治疗结果至关重要。传统CAD系统依赖传统图像分析，而深度学习虽然更有效，但受限于标注数据不足的问题。

Method: 使用Resnet-50在半监督对比学习框架下训练，利用相似性指数处理大量未标注乳腺X光片数据，采用多种数据增强和变换技术提升性能，最后在小规模标注数据上微调模型。

Result: 在INbreast和MIAS基准数据集上实现了96.7%的乳腺癌检测准确率，超越了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 对比学习框架能够有效解决深度学习在医学图像分析中标注数据不足的问题，为乳腺癌早期检测提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Breast cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally,
accounts for a quarter of all cancer cases [1]. To lower this death rate, it is
crucial to detect tumors early, as early-stage detection significantly improves
treatment outcomes. Advances in non-invasive imaging techniques have made early
detection possible through computer-aided detection (CAD) systems which rely on
traditional image analysis to identify malignancies. However, there is a
growing shift towards deep learning methods due to their superior
effectiveness. Despite their potential, deep learning methods often struggle
with accuracy due to the limited availability of large-labeled datasets for
training. To address this issue, our study introduces a Contrastive Learning
(CL) framework, which excels with smaller labeled datasets. In this regard, we
train Resnet-50 in semi supervised CL approach using similarity index on a
large amount of unlabeled mammogram data. In this regard, we use various
augmentation and transformations which help improve the performance of our
approach. Finally, we tune our model on a small set of labelled data that
outperforms the existing state of the art. Specifically, we observed a 96.7%
accuracy in detecting breast cancer on benchmark datasets INbreast and MIAS.

*Simon Baeuerle,Pratik Khanna,Nils Friederich,Angelo Jovin Yamachui Sitcheu,Damir Shakirov,Andreas Steimer,Ralf Mikut*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文测试了基础模型在工业质量检测中的应用，发现这些模型在公开数据集上表现良好，但在真实工业图像数据上失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用基础模型的零样本泛化能力替代繁琐的标注任务，实现跨产品的自动化质量检测，以节省模型设置和实施的精力。

Method: 在定制真实工业图像数据和公共图像数据上测试多个最新基础模型，比较它们在零样本设置下的性能。

Result: 所有测试的基础模型在真实工业数据上均失败，而相同的模型在公共基准数据集上表现良好。

Conclusion: 基础模型在工业质量检测中的实际应用面临挑战，其零样本泛化能力在真实工业场景中可能不如预期。

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) have shown impressive performance on various text and
image processing tasks. They can generalize across domains and datasets in a
zero-shot setting. This could make them suitable for automated quality
inspection during series manufacturing, where various types of images are being
evaluated for many different products. Replacing tedious labeling tasks with a
simple text prompt to describe anomalies and utilizing the same models across
many products would save significant efforts during model setup and
implementation. This is a strong advantage over supervised Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models, which are trained for individual applications and
require labeled training data. We test multiple recent FMs on both custom
real-world industrial image data and public image data. We show that all of
those models fail on our real-world data, while the very same models perform
well on public benchmark datasets.

*Jing Li,Oskar Bartosz,Chengyu Wang,Michal Wnuczynski,Dilshan Godaliyadda,Michael Polley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出通用神经空间（NS）框架，通过编码器-解码器架构预计算跨视觉和成像任务的特征，使多个下游AI模块共享同一特征空间，减少冗余并提高跨域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI模型针对特定高精度任务定制，但在需要执行一系列模块化任务的应用中效率低下，因为每个任务都需要映射到不同的潜在域。

Method: 使用轻量级CNN骨干网络构建编码器-解码器框架，学习具有变换感知和泛化能力的表示，使多个下游模块能在共享特征空间中高效运行。

Result: 实验证明成像和视觉模块（如去马赛克、去噪、深度估计和语义分割）可以在神经空间中高效执行。

Conclusion: 该架构减少了冗余，提高了跨域泛化能力，为高效的多任务视觉管道奠定了基础，且相比大型transformer骨干网络更轻量，硬件适应性更广。

Abstract: The majority of AI models in imaging and vision are customized to perform on
specific high-precision task. However, this strategy is inefficient for
applications with a series of modular tasks, since each requires a mapping into
a disparate latent domain. To address this inefficiency, we proposed a
universal Neural Space (NS), where an encoder-decoder framework pre-computes
features across vision and imaging tasks. Our encoder learns transformation
aware, generalizable representations, which enable multiple downstream AI
modules to share the same feature space. This architecture reduces redundancy,
improves generalization across domain shift, and establishes a foundation for
effecient multi-task vision pipelines. Furthermore, as opposed to larger
transformer backbones, our backbone is lightweight and CNN-based, allowing for
wider across hardware. We furthur demonstrate that imaging and vision modules,
such as demosaicing, denoising, depth estimation and semantic segmentation can
be performed efficiently in the NS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究如何在边缘摄像头系统中选择最有用的训练图像，以在保持低传输成本的同时最大化模型质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘摄像头系统面临不断变化的环境，需要定期更新模型。中心服务器运行复杂教师模型标注数据，然后训练适合边缘设备的小模型。需要解决如何选择最有用的训练图像来平衡模型质量和传输成本的问题。

Method: 采用高置信度流式策略与基于多样性的方法相结合，在相似训练负载（即迭代次数）下，通过最小化数据集查询来训练高质量模型。

Result: 该方法能够在保持低传输成本的同时，产生高质量的模型。

Conclusion: 高置信度流式策略与多样性方法的结合是边缘摄像头系统模型训练的有效解决方案，能够在有限计算资源下实现模型质量最大化。

Abstract: Edge camera-based systems are continuously expanding, facing ever-evolving
environments that require regular model updates. In practice, complex teacher
models are run on a central server to annotate data, which is then used to
train smaller models tailored to the edge devices with limited computational
power. This work explores how to select the most useful images for training to
maximize model quality while keeping transmission costs low. Our work shows
that, for a similar training load (i.e., iterations), a high-confidence
stream-based strategy coupled with a diversity-based approach produces a
high-quality model with minimal dataset queries.

*Julien Han,Shuwen Qiu,Qi Li,Xingzi Xu,Mehmet Saygin Seyfioglu,Kavosh Asadi,Karim Bouyarmane*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstructVTON是一个基于指令的交互式虚拟试穿系统，通过自然语言指导实现细粒度和复杂的样式控制，支持单件或多件服装的试穿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于掩码的虚拟试穿方法存在局限性：生成理想掩码困难、需要专业知识、模型依赖性强，且无法处理某些复杂场景（如卷起袖子的样式控制）。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）和图像分割模型自动生成二进制掩码，基于用户提供的图像和自由文本样式指令，无需精确绘制掩码，并可自动执行多轮图像生成。

Result: InstructVTON与现有虚拟试穿模型兼容，实现了最先进的结果和样式控制能力。

Conclusion: 该系统简化了终端用户体验，解决了传统掩码方法的局限性，为复杂虚拟试穿场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present InstructVTON, an instruction-following interactive virtual try-on
system that allows fine-grained and complex styling control of the resulting
generation, guided by natural language, on single or multiple garments. A
computationally efficient and scalable formulation of virtual try-on formulates
the problem as an image-guided or image-conditioned inpainting task. These
inpainting-based virtual try-on models commonly use a binary mask to control
the generation layout. Producing a mask that yields desirable result is
difficult, requires background knowledge, might be model dependent, and in some
cases impossible with the masking-based approach (e.g. trying on a long-sleeve
shirt with "sleeves rolled up" styling on a person wearing long-sleeve shirt
with sleeves down, where the mask will necessarily cover the entire sleeve).
InstructVTON leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation
models for automated binary mask generation. These masks are generated based on
user-provided images and free-text style instructions. InstructVTON simplifies
the end-user experience by removing the necessity of a precisely drawn mask,
and by automating execution of multiple rounds of image generation for try-on
scenarios that cannot be achieved with masking-based virtual try-on models
alone. We show that InstructVTON is interoperable with existing virtual try-on
models to achieve state-of-the-art results with styling control.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepAFRNet是一个用于识别篡改指纹的深度学习模型，在SOCOFing数据集上对三个难度级别实现了96.7%-99.54%的准确率，但阈值选择对性能影响显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 篡改指纹识别在边境管控、法医鉴定和财政准入等应用中具有重要价值，对手可能故意修改指纹脊线模式以逃避检测，因此需要开发能够识别篡改指纹的鲁棒系统。

Method: 使用VGG16骨干网络提取高维特征，通过余弦相似度比较嵌入向量，在SOCOFing Real-Altered数据集的三个难度级别（简单、中等、困难）上进行评估。

Result: 在严格阈值下，DeepAFRNet在三个难度级别分别达到96.7%、98.76%和99.54%的准确率；但阈值从0.92放宽到0.72时，准确率急剧下降到7.86%、27.05%和29.51%。

Conclusion: DeepAFRNet通过使用真实篡改样本和分级指标，解决了基于合成篡改或有限验证协议的先前工作的局限性，表明其已具备在安全和识别韧性都至关重要的实际部署中的适用性。

Abstract: Altered fingerprint recognition (AFR) is challenging for biometric
verification in applications such as border control, forensics, and fiscal
admission. Adversaries can deliberately modify ridge patterns to evade
detection, so robust recognition of altered prints is essential. We present
DeepAFRNet, a deep learning recognition model that matches and recognizes
distorted fingerprint samples. The approach uses a VGG16 backbone to extract
high-dimensional features and cosine similarity to compare embeddings. We
evaluate on the SOCOFing Real-Altered subset with three difficulty levels
(Easy, Medium, Hard). With strict thresholds, DeepAFRNet achieves accuracies of
96.7 percent, 98.76 percent, and 99.54 percent for the three levels. A
threshold-sensitivity study shows that relaxing the threshold from 0.92 to 0.72
sharply degrades accuracy to 7.86 percent, 27.05 percent, and 29.51 percent,
underscoring the importance of threshold selection in biometric systems. By
using real altered samples and reporting per-level metrics, DeepAFRNet
addresses limitations of prior work based on synthetic alterations or limited
verification protocols, and indicates readiness for real-world deployments
where both security and recognition resilience are critical.

Conclusion: 注意力引导的特征化方法能显著提升基于体素的机器人操作策略性能

Abstract: We investigate the integration of attention maps from a pre-trained Vision
Transformer into voxel representations to enhance bimanual robotic

self-supervised ViT model, and interpret them as pixel-level saliency scores
over RGB images. These maps are lifted into a 3D voxel grid, resulting in
voxel-level semantic cues that are incorporated into a behavior cloning policy.
When integrated into a state-of-the-art voxel-based policy, our
attention-guided featurization yields an average absolute improvement of 8.2%
and a relative gain of 21.9% across all tasks in the RLBench bimanual
benchmark.

Conclusion: 研究为蓝莓检测提供了全面的基准分析，证明了半监督学习的有效性，但需要进一步研究以更好地利用跨域未标注数据。数据集和软件已公开供后续研究使用。

Abstract: Blueberry detection in natural environments remains challenging due to
variable lighting, occlusions, and motion blur due to environmental factors and
imaging devices. Deep learning-based object detectors promise to address these
challenges, but they demand a large-scale, diverse dataset that captures the
real-world complexities. Moreover, deploying these models in practical
scenarios often requires the right accuracy/speed/memory trade-off in model
selection. This study presents a novel comparative benchmark analysis of
advanced real-time object detectors, including YOLO (You Only Look Once)
(v8-v12) and RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformers) (v1-v2) families,
consisting of 36 model variants, evaluated on a newly curated dataset for
blueberry detection. This dataset comprises 661 canopy images collected with
smartphones during the 2022-2023 seasons, consisting of 85,879 labelled
instances (including 36,256 ripe and 49,623 unripe blueberries) across a wide
range of lighting conditions, occlusions, and fruit maturity stages. Among the
YOLO models, YOLOv12m achieved the best accuracy with a mAP@50 of 93.3%, while
RT-DETRv2-X obtained a mAP@50 of 93.6%, the highest among all the RT-DETR
variants. The inference time varied with the model scale and complexity, and
the mid-sized models appeared to offer a good accuracy-speed balance. To
further enhance detection performance, all the models were fine-tuned using
Unbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) on a separate set of
1,035 unlabeled images acquired by a ground-based machine vision platform in
2024. This resulted in accuracy gains ranging from -1.4% to 2.9%, with
RT-DETR-v2-X achieving the best mAP@50 of 94.8%. More in-depth research into
SSL is needed to better leverage cross-domain unlabeled data. Both the dataset
and software programs of this study are made publicly available to support
further research.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种轻量级的感兴趣区域（ROI）增强策略，用于提升乳腺X光片分类性能，在Mini-DDSM数据集上取得了适度的ROC-AUC提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺X光筛查对早期检测和降低死亡率至关重要，但深度学习在乳腺X光片解读中受限于低分辨率数据集和小样本量。

Method: 在训练过程中，全图以概率方式被替换为从预计算的无标签边界框库中随机采样的ROI裁剪，并可选择添加抖动以增加变异性。该方法仅在训练时使用，推理成本不变。

Result: 在Mini-DDSM数据集上，ROI增强（最佳参数：p_roi=0.10，alpha=0.10）带来了适度的平均ROC-AUC提升，但性能在不同折叠间有变化；PR-AUC持平或略有下降。

Conclusion: 结果表明，简单、以数据为中心的ROI策略可以在受限环境下增强乳腺X光片分类，无需额外标签或架构修改。

Abstract: Breast cancer screening with mammography remains central to early detection
and mortality reduction. Deep learning has shown strong potential for
automating mammogram interpretation, yet limited-resolution datasets and small
sample sizes continue to restrict performance. We revisit the Mini-DDSM dataset
(9,684 images; 2,414 patients) and introduce a lightweight region-of-interest
(ROI) augmentation strategy. During training, full images are probabilistically
replaced with random ROI crops sampled from a precomputed, label-free
bounding-box bank, with optional jitter to increase variability. We evaluate
under strict patient-level cross-validation and report ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and
training-time efficiency metrics (throughput and GPU memory). Because ROI
augmentation is training-only, inference-time cost remains unchanged. On
Mini-DDSM, ROI augmentation (best: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest
average ROC-AUC gains, with performance varying across folds; PR-AUC is flat to
slightly lower. These results demonstrate that simple, data-centric ROI
strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings
without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications.

TL;DR: 利用镜面反射作为辅助视角，构建虚拟相机实现单图像多视角立体视觉，简化3D重建过程并兼容前馈重建模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 镜面反射在日常环境中常见，能提供单次拍摄中的立体信息，通过利用反射作为辅助视角来简化3D重建过程

Method: 设计变换构建物理有效的虚拟相机，直接生成虚拟视角像素，并提出对称感知损失来优化姿态估计

Result: 在真实世界和合成数据上的广泛实验证明了方法的有效性，提供了包含16个场景的合成数据集

Conclusion: 该方法能够从单张包含镜面反射的图像实现高效3D重建，并自然扩展到动态场景

Abstract: Mirror reflections are common in everyday environments and can provide stereo
information within a single capture, as the real and reflected virtual views
are visible simultaneously. We exploit this property by treating the reflection
as an auxiliary view and designing a transformation that constructs a
physically valid virtual camera, allowing direct pixel-domain generation of the
virtual view while adhering to the real-world imaging process. This enables a
multi-view stereo setup from a single image, simplifying the imaging process,
making it compatible with powerful feed-forward reconstruction models for
generalizable and robust 3D reconstruction. To further exploit the geometric
symmetry introduced by mirrors, we propose a symmetric-aware loss to refine
pose estimation. Our framework also naturally extends to dynamic scenes, where
each frame contains a mirror reflection, enabling efficient per-frame geometry
recovery. For quantitative evaluation, we provide a fully customizable
synthetic dataset of 16 Blender scenes, each with ground-truth point clouds and
camera poses. Extensive experiments on real-world data and synthetic data are
conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: FacadeTrack是一个街景级别的语言引导框架，通过全景视频链接地块、校正立面视图并提取可解释属性，用于灾后建筑占用评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾后建筑占用评估对于分类、检查、公用事业重新供电和公平资源分配至关重要。高空影像覆盖快但缺乏立面细节，街景影像有细节但稀疏且难以与地块对齐。

Method: 提出FacadeTrack框架，链接全景视频与地块，校正立面视图，提取可解释属性（如入口堵塞、临时覆盖物、局部碎片），采用两种决策策略：透明的一阶段规则和分离感知与保守推理的两阶段设计。

Result: 在两个飓风Helene灾后调查中，两阶段方法达到精度0.927、召回率0.781、F-1分数0.848；一阶段基线为精度0.943、召回率0.728、F-1分数0.822。中间属性和空间诊断揭示了残余错误的原因和位置。

Conclusion: 该管道提供可审计、可扩展的占用评估，适合集成到地理空间和应急管理工作流程中，通过目标质量控制提高准确性。

Abstract: Building-level occupancy after disasters is vital for triage, inspections,
utility re-energization, and equitable resource allocation. Overhead imagery
provides rapid coverage but often misses facade and access cues that determine
habitability, while street-view imagery captures those details but is sparse
and difficult to align with parcels. We present FacadeTrack, a street-level,
language-guided framework that links panoramic video to parcels, rectifies
views to facades, and elicits interpretable attributes (for example, entry
blockage, temporary coverings, localized debris) that drive two decision
strategies: a transparent one-stage rule and a two-stage design that separates
perception from conservative reasoning. Evaluated across two post-Hurricane
Helene surveys, the two-stage approach achieves a precision of 0.927, a recall
of 0.781, and an F-1 score of 0.848, compared with the one-stage baseline at a
precision of 0.943, a recall of 0.728, and an F-1 score of 0.822. Beyond
accuracy, intermediate attributes and spatial diagnostics reveal where and why
residual errors occur, enabling targeted quality control. The pipeline provides
auditable, scalable occupancy assessments suitable for integration into
geospatial and emergency-management workflows.

### [15] [Human Semantic Representations of Social Interactions from Moving Shapes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20673)
*Yiling Yun,Hongjing Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探讨人类如何通过简单的移动形状识别社会互动，发现语义表征对视觉特征具有补充作用，其中基于动词的嵌入最能解释人类相似性判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解人类在识别社会互动时使用的语义表征，以及这些表征如何补充视觉特征。

Method: 研究1直接让参与者标记动画印象；研究2通过人类相似性判断测量27种社会互动的表征几何，并与基于视觉特征、标签和语义嵌入的模型预测进行比较。

Result: 语义模型为解释人类判断提供了视觉特征之外的补充信息，其中基于动词的嵌入最能解释人类相似性判断。

Conclusion: 简单显示中的社会感知反映了社会互动的语义结构，连接了视觉和抽象表征。

Abstract: Humans are social creatures who readily recognize various social interactions
from simple display of moving shapes. While previous research has often focused
on visual features, we examine what semantic representations that humans employ
to complement visual features. In Study 1, we directly asked human participants
to label the animations based on their impression of moving shapes. We found
that human responses were distributed. In Study 2, we measured the
representational geometry of 27 social interactions through human similarity
judgments and compared it with model predictions based on visual features,
labels, and semantic embeddings from animation descriptions. We found that
semantic models provided complementary information to visual features in
explaining human judgments. Among the semantic models, verb-based embeddings
extracted from descriptions account for human similarity judgments the best.
These results suggest that social perception in simple displays reflects the
semantic structure of social interactions, bridging visual and abstract
representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在严重外观变化下的鲁棒性问题，以及建立可靠的全局-局部对应关系

Method: 使用E(2)-Steerable CNN提取旋转和视角变化下的稳定特征，构建带虚拟超级节点的图结构实现全局语义聚合和局部一致性

Result: 在University-1652和SUES-200基准测试中取得显著性能提升，建立了跨域CVGL的新最先进水平

Conclusion: EGS框架有效解决了跨视角地理定位中的跨域泛化挑战，为处理无人机视角变化提供了可靠解决方案

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) aims to match images of the same location
captured from drastically different viewpoints. Despite recent progress,
existing methods still face two key challenges: (1) achieving robustness under
severe appearance variations induced by diverse UAV orientations and fields of
view, which hinders cross-domain generalization, and (2) establishing reliable
correspondences that capture both global scene-level semantics and fine-grained
local details. In this paper, we propose EGS, a novel CVGL framework designed
to enhance cross-domain generalization. Specifically, we introduce an
E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder to extract stable and reliable features under
rotation and viewpoint shifts. Furthermore, we construct a graph with a virtual
super-node that connects to all local nodes, enabling global semantics to be
aggregated and redistributed to local regions, thereby enforcing global-local
consistency. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200
benchmarks demonstrate that EGS consistently achieves substantial performance
gains and establishes a new state of the art in cross-domain CVGL.

Motivation: 红外小目标缺乏明显的纹理和形态特征，容易与杂乱的背景融合。现有方法依赖固定的梯度算子或简单的注意力机制，在低对比度和高噪声条件下无法准确提取目标边缘。

Method: 采用双路径网络结构：第一条路径使用双向交互模块（局部自注意力和全局自注意力）捕获多尺度特征依赖；第二条路径使用多边缘细化器，通过级联泰勒有限差分算子和注意力门控机制增强细粒度边缘细节。

Result: 该方法在红外小目标检测任务中表现出色，能够精确地定位和检测不同尺寸的目标，同时有效抑制噪声干扰。

Conclusion: 提出的双路径边缘网络为精确的红外小目标检测和定位提供了一个有前景的解决方案，将结构语义和边缘细化统一在一个框架中。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection is crucial for remote sensing applications
like disaster warning and maritime surveillance. However, due to the lack of
distinctive texture and morphological features, infrared small targets are
highly susceptible to blending into cluttered and noisy backgrounds. A
fundamental challenge in designing deep models for this task lies in the
inherent conflict between capturing high-resolution spatial details for minute
targets and extracting robust semantic context for larger targets, often
leading to feature misalignment and suboptimal performance. Existing methods
often rely on fixed gradient operators or simplistic attention mechanisms,
which are inadequate for accurately extracting target edges under low contrast
and high noise. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Path Edge Network that
explicitly addresses this challenge by decoupling edge enhancement and semantic
modeling into two complementary processing paths. The first path employs a
Bidirectional Interaction Module, which uses both Local Self-Attention and
Global Self-Attention to capture multi-scale local and global feature
dependencies. The global attention mechanism, based on a Transformer
architecture, integrates long-range semantic relationships and contextual
information, ensuring robust scene understanding. The second path introduces
the Multi-Edge Refiner, which enhances fine-grained edge details using cascaded
Taylor finite difference operators at multiple scales. This mathematical
approach, along with an attention-driven gating mechanism, enables precise edge
localization and feature enhancement for targets of varying sizes, while
effectively suppressing noise. Our method provides a promising solution for
precise infrared small target detection and localization, combining structural
semantics and edge refinement in a unified framework.

Motivation: 传统的意图识别主要关注个体意图，忽略了群体环境中集体意图的复杂性。为了填补这一研究空白，论文引入了群体意图的概念。

Method: 提出了SHOT数据集（包含1,979个篮球视频片段，5个摄像机视角，6种个体属性标注）和GIFT框架（提取细粒度个体特征并建模群体动态演化）。

Result: 实验结果表明SHOT数据集和GIFT框架的有效性，为群体意图预测研究奠定了坚实基础。

Conclusion: 该研究为群体意图预测领域建立了基准，数据集已公开可用，为未来相关研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Intention recognition has traditionally focused on individual intentions,
overlooking the complexities of collective intentions in group settings. To
address this limitation, we introduce the concept of group intention, which
represents shared goals emerging through the actions of multiple individuals,
and Group Intention Forecasting (GIF), a novel task that forecasts when group
intentions will occur by analyzing individual actions and interactions before
the collective goal becomes apparent. To investigate GIF in a specific
scenario, we propose SHOT, the first large-scale dataset for GIF, consisting of
1,979 basketball video clips captured from 5 camera views and annotated with 6
types of individual attributes. SHOT is designed with 3 key characteristics:
multi-individual information, multi-view adaptability, and multi-level
intention, making it well-suited for studying emerging group intentions.
Furthermore, we introduce GIFT (Group Intention ForecasTer), a framework that
extracts fine-grained individual features and models evolving group dynamics to
forecast intention emergence. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of
SHOT and GIFT, establishing a strong foundation for future research in group
intention forecasting. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: Neptune-X是一个数据中心的生成-选择框架，通过合成数据生成和任务感知样本选择来解决海事目标检测中的数据稀缺和泛化能力差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海事目标检测面临两个关键挑战：标注数据稀缺以及在不同海事属性（如目标类别、视角、位置和成像环境）上的泛化能力差。现有数据集训练的模型在代表性不足的场景（如开阔海域环境）中表现不佳。

Method: 提出Neptune-X框架，包含两个核心组件：1）X-to-Maritime多模态条件生成模型，通过双向目标-水域注意力模块捕捉目标与水域环境的边界交互；2）属性相关主动采样方法，基于任务相关性动态选择合成样本。

Conclusion: Neptune-X通过数据中心的生成-选择方法有效解决了海事目标检测的数据稀缺和泛化问题，为海事场景分析提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Maritime object detection is essential for navigation safety, surveillance,
and autonomous operations, yet constrained by two key challenges: the scarcity
of annotated maritime data and poor generalization across various maritime
attributes (e.g., object category, viewpoint, location, and imaging
environment). % In particular, models trained on existing datasets often
underperform in underrepresented scenarios such as open-sea environments. To
address these challenges, we propose Neptune-X, a data-centric
generative-selection framework that enhances training effectiveness by
leveraging synthetic data generation with task-aware sample selection. From the
generation perspective, we develop X-to-Maritime, a multi-modality-conditioned
generative model that synthesizes diverse and realistic maritime scenes. A key
component is the Bidirectional Object-Water Attention module, which captures
boundary interactions between objects and their aquatic surroundings to improve
visual fidelity. To further improve downstream tasking performance, we propose
Attribute-correlated Active Sampling, which dynamically selects synthetic
samples based on their task relevance. To support robust benchmarking, we
construct the Maritime Generation Dataset, the first dataset tailored for
generative maritime learning, encompassing a wide range of semantic conditions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark in
maritime scene synthesis, significantly improving detection accuracy,
particularly in challenging and previously underrepresented settings.The code

TL;DR: STELLA是第一个用于长期月球测绘的端到端陨石坑导航管道，结合了Mask R-CNN陨石坑检测器、无描述符识别模块、鲁棒的PnC位姿求解器和批量轨道确定后端，在模拟一年月球测绘任务的数据集上实现了米级位置精度和亚度级姿态精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的陨石坑导航技术主要针对短期降落任务，而长期月球测绘任务面临稀疏、倾斜图像采集、变化光照条件等更大挑战，需要开发专门针对长期测绘的导航解决方案。

Method: STELLA管道包含四个核心模块：基于Mask R-CNN的陨石坑检测器、无描述符陨石坑识别模块、鲁棒的透视n点陨石坑位姿求解器、批量轨道确定后端。使用CRESENT-365数据集进行测试，该数据集包含15,283张图像，模拟一年月球测绘任务。

Result: 在CRESENT+和CRESENT-365数据集上的实验表明，STELLA在各种视角、光照条件和月球纬度下平均保持米级位置精度和亚度级姿态精度。

Conclusion: 这是首次在真实月球测绘环境下对陨石坑导航进行全面评估，为未来任务的运行条件提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Crater-Based Navigation (CBN) uses the ubiquitous impact craters of the Moon
observed on images as natural landmarks to determine the six degrees of freedom
pose of a spacecraft. To date, CBN has primarily been studied in the context of
powered descent and landing. These missions are typically short in duration,
with high-frequency imagery captured from a nadir viewpoint over well-lit
terrain. In contrast, lunar mapping missions involve sparse, oblique imagery
acquired under varying illumination conditions over potentially year-long
campaigns, posing significantly greater challenges for pose estimation. We
bridge this gap with STELLA - the first end-to-end CBN pipeline for
long-duration lunar mapping. STELLA combines a Mask R-CNN-based crater
detector, a descriptor-less crater identification module, a robust
perspective-n-crater pose solver, and a batch orbit determination back-end. To
rigorously test STELLA, we introduce CRESENT-365 - the first public dataset
that emulates a year-long lunar mapping mission. Each of its 15,283 images is
rendered from high-resolution digital elevation models with SPICE-derived Sun
angles and Moon motion, delivering realistic global coverage, illumination
cycles, and viewing geometries. Experiments on CRESENT+ and CRESENT-365 show
that STELLA maintains metre-level position accuracy and sub-degree attitude
accuracy on average across wide ranges of viewing angles, illumination
conditions, and lunar latitudes. These results constitute the first
comprehensive assessment of CBN in a true lunar mapping setting and inform
operational conditions that should be considered for future missions.

*Zoe Wanying He,Sean Trott,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了仅视觉和仅语言模型在表示空间中的对齐现象，发现对齐在模型中层到深层达到峰值，反映从模态特定到概念共享表示的转变，且这种对齐与人类判断一致并在示例聚合中得到增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度视觉和语言模型在分离的模态上训练，但它们将输入投影到部分对齐的表示空间。然而，对于这种对齐在网络的何处出现、支持它的视觉或语言线索是什么、它是否在多对多图像-文本场景中捕捉人类偏好、以及聚合相同概念的示例如何影响对齐等问题，仍缺乏清晰认识。

Method: 通过系统调查，分析对齐在模型各层的出现位置，测试对齐对仅外观变化和语义变化的鲁棒性，使用强制选择的"Pick-a-Pic"任务评估人类偏好与嵌入空间的一致性，并研究示例聚合对对齐的影响。

Result: 对齐在两种模型类型的中层到深层达到峰值；对齐对仅外观变化鲁棒，但在语义改变时崩溃；人类对图像-标题匹配的偏好在所有视觉-语言模型对的嵌入空间中得到反映；平均嵌入跨示例会增强对齐而非模糊细节。

Conclusion: 单模态网络收敛于一个共享的语义代码，该代码与人类判断一致，并通过示例聚合得到加强。

Abstract: Recent studies show that deep vision-only and language-only models--trained
on disjoint modalities--nonetheless project their inputs into a partially
aligned representational space. Yet we still lack a clear picture of where in
each network this convergence emerges, what visual or linguistic cues support
it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios,
and how aggregating exemplars of the same concept affects alignment. Here, we
systematically investigate these questions. We find that alignment peaks in
mid-to-late layers of both model types, reflecting a shift from
modality-specific to conceptually shared representations. This alignment is
robust to appearance-only changes but collapses when semantics are altered
(e.g., object removal or word-order scrambling), highlighting that the shared
code is truly semantic. Moving beyond the one-to-one image-caption paradigm, a
forced-choice "Pick-a-Pic" task shows that human preferences for image-caption
matches are mirrored in the embedding spaces across all vision-language model
pairs. This pattern holds bidirectionally when multiple captions correspond to
a single image, demonstrating that models capture fine-grained semantic
distinctions akin to human judgments. Surprisingly, averaging embeddings across
exemplars amplifies alignment rather than blurring detail. Together, our
results demonstrate that unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code
that aligns with human judgments and strengthens with exemplar aggregation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑方法在个性化物体合成任务中存在几何控制不足和风格一致性差的问题，同时缺乏无需大量训练的有效解决方案。

Method: 首先将2D物体转换为3D模型，在3D层面进行交互式编辑，然后从指定视角重新渲染为2D图像，结合扩散适配器实现几何、风格和内容的控制。

Result: 该方法能够生成具有精确几何控制和风格一致性的编辑图像，无需额外训练即可实现高质量的物体插入。

Conclusion: FreeInsert通过利用3D几何信息，为图像编辑提供了更好的几何控制和风格一致性，是训练自由框架的重要进展。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have made significant progress in image
generation, allowing for effortless customized generation. However, existing
image editing methods still face certain limitations when dealing with
personalized image composition tasks. First, there is the issue of lack of
geometric control over the inserted objects. Current methods are confined to 2D
space and typically rely on textual instructions, making it challenging to
maintain precise geometric control over the objects. Second, there is the
challenge of style consistency. Existing methods often overlook the style
consistency between the inserted object and the background, resulting in a lack
of realism. In addition, the challenge of inserting objects into images without
extensive training remains significant. To address these issues, we propose
\textit{FreeInsert}, a novel training-free framework that customizes object
insertion into arbitrary scenes by leveraging 3D geometric information.
Benefiting from the advances in existing 3D generation models, we first convert
the 2D object into 3D, perform interactive editing at the 3D level, and then
re-render it into a 2D image from a specified view. This process introduces
geometric controls such as shape or view. The rendered image, serving as
geometric control, is combined with style and content control achieved through
diffusion adapters, ultimately producing geometrically controlled,
style-consistent edited images via the diffusion model.

Abstract: Recently remarkable progress has been made in synthesizing realistic human
photos using text-to-image diffusion models. However, current approaches face
degraded scenes, insufficient control, and suboptimal perceptual identity. We
introduce CustomEnhancer, a novel framework to augment existing identity
customization models. CustomEnhancer is a zero-shot enhancement pipeline that
leverages face swapping techniques, pretrained diffusion model, to obtain
additional representations in a zeroshot manner for encoding into personalized
models. Through our proposed triple-flow fused PerGeneration approach, which
identifies and combines two compatible counter-directional latent spaces to
manipulate a pivotal space of personalized model, we unify the generation and
reconstruction processes, realizing generation from three flows. Our pipeline
also enables comprehensive training-free control over the generation process of
personalized models, offering precise controlled personalization for them and
eliminating the need for controller retraining for per-model. Besides, to
address the high time complexity of null-text inversion (NTI), we introduce
ResInversion, a novel inversion method that performs noise rectification via a
pre-diffusion mechanism, reducing the inversion time by 129 times. Experiments
demonstrate that CustomEnhancer reach SOTA results at scene diversity, identity
fidelity, training-free controls, while also showing the efficiency of our
ResInversion over NTI. The code will be made publicly available upon paper
acceptance.

"split" inferencing. Our study showcases various use cases of the evaluation
platform incorporated with standard codecs (under development) by examining the
compression gain on several datasets in terms of bit-rate versus task accuracy.
This evaluation platform has been developed as open-source software and is

Conclusion: DAC框架有效解决了CD-SSDG中的挑战，在存在领域偏移的情况下实现了鲁棒的医学图像分割性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) in medical image segmentation
offers a promising solution for generalizing to unseen domains during testing,
addressing domain shift challenges and minimizing annotation costs. However,
conventional SSDG methods assume labeled and unlabeled data are available for
each source domain in the training set, a condition that is not always met in
practice. The coexistence of limited annotation and domain shift in the
training set is a prevalent issue. Thus, this paper explores a more practical
and challenging scenario, cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization
(CD-SSDG), where domain shifts occur between labeled and unlabeled training
data, in addition to shifts between training and testing sets. Existing SSDG
methods exhibit sub-optimal performance under such domain shifts because of
inaccurate pseudolabels. To address this issue, we propose a novel
dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework tailored for CD-SSDG.
Building upon the co-training paradigm with two sub-models offering cross
pseudo supervision, our DAC framework integrates extra feature-level
supervision and asymmetric auxiliary tasks for each sub-model. This
feature-level supervision serves to address inaccurate pseudo supervision
caused by domain shifts between labeled and unlabeled data, utilizing
complementary supervision from the rich feature space. Additionally, two
distinct auxiliary self-supervised tasks are integrated into each sub-model to
enhance domain-invariant discriminative feature learning and prevent model
collapse. Extensive experiments on real-world medical image segmentation
datasets, i.e., Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM, demonstrate the robust
generalizability of the proposed DAC framework.

TL;DR: DEIMv2是DEIM框架的扩展版本，通过集成DINOv3特征和引入空间调谐适配器(STA)，在八个不同规模模型上实现了性能突破，特别是在参数效率和检测精度方面显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DEIM已成为实时DETR的主流训练框架，性能优于YOLO系列。本研究旨在通过集成DINOv3特征来进一步提升性能，并覆盖从GPU到移动设备的广泛部署场景。

Method: 对于X/L/M/S模型：采用DINOv3预训练或蒸馏骨干网络，引入空间调谐适配器(STA)将单尺度输出转换为多尺度特征；对于超轻量模型(Nano/Pico/Femto/Atto)：使用HGNetv2进行深度和宽度剪枝，配合简化解码器和升级的Dense O2O。

Conclusion: DEIMv2通过统一设计实现了跨多样化场景的优越性能-成本权衡，建立了新的最先进结果，特别是在参数效率方面表现突出。

Abstract: Benefiting from the simplicity and effectiveness of Dense O2O and MAL, DEIM
has become the mainstream training framework for real-time DETRs, significantly
outperforming the YOLO series. In this work, we extend it with DINOv3 features,
resulting in DEIMv2. DEIMv2 spans eight model sizes from X to Atto, covering
GPU, edge, and mobile deployment. For the X, L, M, and S variants, we adopt
DINOv3-pretrained or distilled backbones and introduce a Spatial Tuning Adapter
(STA), which efficiently converts DINOv3's single-scale output into multi-scale
features and complements strong semantics with fine-grained details to enhance
detection. For ultra-lightweight models (Nano, Pico, Femto, and Atto), we
employ HGNetv2 with depth and width pruning to meet strict resource budgets.
Together with a simplified decoder and an upgraded Dense O2O, this unified
design enables DEIMv2 to achieve a superior performance-cost trade-off across
diverse scenarios, establishing new state-of-the-art results. Notably, our
largest model, DEIMv2-X, achieves 57.8 AP with only 50.3 million parameters,
surpassing prior X-scale models that require over 60 million parameters for
just 56.5 AP. On the compact side, DEIMv2-S is the first sub-10 million model
(9.71 million) to exceed the 50 AP milestone on COCO, reaching 50.9 AP. Even
the ultra-lightweight DEIMv2-Pico, with just 1.5 million parameters, delivers
38.5 AP, matching YOLOv10-Nano (2.3 million) with around 50 percent fewer
parameters.

*Ved Umrajkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAC-LoRA是一种将对抗训练集成到参数高效微调(PEFT)中的新框架，通过动态对抗课程学习逐步提升Vision-Language Models的对抗鲁棒性，同时保持清洁准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models在自动驾驶、医疗诊断等安全关键应用中具有重要作用，但现有的参数高效微调方法如LoRA虽然能高效适配专业任务，却容易受到对抗攻击的影响，可能危及安全决策。

Method: 提出DAC-LoRA框架，集成对抗训练到PEFT中，采用智能课程学习策略，基于一阶平稳条件和TRADES启发式损失函数，逐步增加攻击难度来提升模型鲁棒性。

Result: DAC-LoRA在显著提升对抗鲁棒性的同时，没有明显损害清洁准确率，提供了一种轻量级且广泛适用的增强鲁棒性方法。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了DAC-LoRA框架可以轻松集成到标准PEFT流程中，显著增强模型鲁棒性，为解决VLMs的安全漏洞提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are foundational to critical applications like
autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and content moderation. While
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA enable their efficient
adaptation to specialized tasks, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that can compromise safety-critical decisions. CLIP, the backbone for
numerous downstream VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can
cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem. We propose Dynamic Adversarial
Curriculum DAC-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates adversarial training
into PEFT. The core principle of our method i.e. an intelligent curriculum of
progressively challenging attack, is general and can potentially be applied to
any iterative attack method. Guided by the First-Order Stationary Condition
(FOSC) and a TRADES-inspired loss, DAC-LoRA achieves substantial improvements
in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy.
Our work presents an effective, lightweight, and broadly applicable method to
demonstrate that the DAC-LoRA framework can be easily integrated into a
standard PEFT pipeline to significantly enhance robustness.

*Jianhan Wu,Xiaoyang Qu,Zhangcheng Huang,Jianzong Wang*

TL;DR: 本文提出FedDSPG方法，通过生成域特定软提示来处理联邦域泛化任务，在多个公开数据集上达到SOTA效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于提示学习的联邦域泛化方法学习的提示多样性有限，且容易忽略未知域的信息

Method: 在训练阶段为每个域引入域特定软提示，将内容和域知识整合到客户端间的生成模型中；在推理阶段利用生成器获取未见目标域的DSPs

Result: 在多个公开数据集上的综合评估证实该方法在FDG任务中优于现有强基线

Conclusion: FedDSPG方法从生成视角有效解决了联邦域泛化问题，实现了最先进的性能

Abstract: Prompt learning has become an efficient paradigm for adapting CLIP to
downstream tasks. Compared with traditional fine-tuning, prompt learning
optimizes a few parameters yet yields highly competitive results, especially
appealing in federated learning for computational efficiency. engendering
domain shift among clients and posing a formidable challenge for
downstream-task adaptation. Existing federated domain generalization (FDG)
methods based on prompt learning typically learn soft prompts from training
samples, replacing manually designed prompts to enhance the generalization
ability of federated models. However, these learned prompts exhibit limited
diversity and tend to ignore information from unknown domains. We propose a
novel and effective method from a generative perspective for handling FDG
tasks, namely federated domain generalization with domain-specific soft prompts
generation (FedDSPG). Specifically, during training, we introduce
domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) for each domain and integrate content and
domain knowledge into the generative model among clients. In the inference
phase, the generator is utilized to obtain DSPs for unseen target domains, thus
guiding downstream tasks in unknown domains. Comprehensive evaluations across
several public datasets confirm that our method outperforms existing strong
baselines in FDG, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Low back pain affects millions worldwide, driving the need for robust
diagnostic models that can jointly analyze complex medical images and
accompanying text reports. We present LumbarCLIP, a novel multimodal framework
that leverages contrastive language-image pretraining to align lumbar spine MRI
scans with corresponding radiological descriptions. Built upon a curated
dataset containing axial MRI views paired with expert-written reports,
LumbarCLIP integrates vision encoders (ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, Swin
Transformer) with a BERT-based text encoder to extract dense representations.
These are projected into a shared embedding space via learnable projection
heads, configurable as linear or non-linear, and normalized to facilitate
stable contrastive training using a soft CLIP loss. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on downstream classification, reaching up to
95.00% accuracy and 94.75% F1-score on the test set, despite inherent class
imbalance. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate that linear projection heads
yield more effective cross-modal alignment than non-linear variants. LumbarCLIP
offers a promising foundation for automated musculoskeletal diagnosis and
clinical decision support.

TL;DR: PoisonVID是首个针对VideoLLMs中提示引导采样策略的黑盒中毒攻击，通过闭环优化策略在多个VideoLLMs上实现了82%-99%的攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然VideoLLMs在视频理解方面表现出色，但先前采样策略的漏洞已被发现，而提示引导采样的安全性尚未被探索。

Method: PoisonVID通过闭环优化策略迭代优化通用扰动，利用影子VideoLLM和GPT-4o-mini构建的改写有害描述集来抑制有害帧的相关性分数。

Result: 在三种提示引导采样策略和三个先进VideoLLMs上的综合评估显示，PoisonVID达到了82%-99%的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了为VideoLLMs开发未来先进采样策略的重要性，以应对此类安全威胁。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
understanding videos, supporting tasks such as summarization, captioning, and
question answering. Their performance has been driven by advances in frame
sampling, progressing from uniform-based to semantic-similarity-based and, most
recently, prompt-guided strategies. While vulnerabilities have been identified
in earlier sampling strategies, the safety of prompt-guided sampling remains
unexplored. We close this gap by presenting PoisonVID, the first black-box
poisoning attack that undermines prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs. PoisonVID
compromises the underlying prompt-guided sampling mechanism through a
closed-loop optimization strategy that iteratively optimizes a universal
perturbation to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, guided by a depiction
set constructed from paraphrased harmful descriptions leveraging a shadow
VideoLLM and a lightweight language model, i.e., GPT-4o-mini. Comprehensively
evaluated on three prompt-guided sampling strategies and across three advanced
VideoLLMs, PoisonVID achieves 82% - 99% attack success rate, highlighting the
importance of developing future advanced sampling strategies for VideoLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GoR是一种新颖的可学习正则化方法，通过仅使用两个可训练参数进行动态损失加权，自适应地平衡任务特定和知识蒸馏目标，解决了量化感知训练中梯度冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的QAT-KD方法在低比特量化下难以平衡任务特定损失和蒸馏损失，由于异质梯度幅度导致性能下降。

Method: 提出Game of Regularizer (GoR)方法，使用两个可训练参数动态调整损失权重；同时引入QAT-EKD-GoR集成蒸馏框架，利用多个异构教师模型。

Result: 在图像分类、目标检测和LLM压缩任务中，GoR一致优于最先进的QAT-KD方法，在低功耗边缘设备上实现更快推理同时保持全精度准确率。

Conclusion: GoR为资源受限硬件上的AI模型压缩提供了鲁棒解决方案，在最优条件下甚至可以超越全精度模型性能。

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) combined with knowledge distillation (KD)
is a promising strategy for compressing Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for
deployment on resource-constrained hardware. However, existing QAT-KD methods
often struggle to balance task-specific (TS) and distillation losses due to
heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization. We
propose Game of Regularizer (GoR), a novel learnable regularization method that
adaptively balances TS and KD objectives using only two trainable parameters
for dynamic loss weighting. GoR reduces conflict between supervision signals,
improves convergence, and boosts the performance of small quantized models
(SQMs). Experiments on image classification, object detection (OD), and large
language model (LLM) compression show that GoR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods. On low-power edge devices, it delivers faster
inference while maintaining full-precision accuracy. We also introduce
QAT-EKD-GoR, an ensemble distillation framework that uses multiple
heterogeneous teacher models. Under optimal conditions, the proposed EKD-GoR
can outperform full-precision models, providing a robust solution for
real-world deployment.

Motivation: 评估网络收集的大规模含标签噪声数据集能否替代专家验证的小数据集，解决植物物种图像资源不足的问题

Method: 使用网络收集的噪声数据集和专家验证数据集分别训练模型，通过Pl@ntNet移动应用收集的第三方测试集进行公平比较

Result: 挑战赛比较了不同训练策略的性能，分析了大规模噪声数据集的潜力与局限性

Conclusion: 网络收集的大规模数据集在植物识别任务中具有一定竞争力，但需要有效处理标签噪声问题

Abstract: The 2017-th edition of the LifeCLEF plant identification challenge is an
important milestone towards automated plant identification systems working at
the scale of continental floras with 10.000 plant species living mainly in
Europe and North America illustrated by a total of 1.1M images. Nowadays, such
ambitious systems are enabled thanks to the conjunction of the dazzling recent
progress in image classification with deep learning and several outstanding
international initiatives, such as the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), aggregating
the visual knowledge on plant species coming from the main national botany
institutes. However, despite all these efforts the majority of the plant
species still remain without pictures or are poorly illustrated. Outside the
institutional channels, a much larger number of plant pictures are available
and spread on the web through botanist blogs, plant lovers web-pages, image
hosting websites and on-line plant retailers. The LifeCLEF 2017 plant challenge
presented in this paper aimed at evaluating to what extent a large noisy
training dataset collected through the web and containing a lot of labelling
errors can compete with a smaller but trusted training dataset checked by
experts. To fairly compare both training strategies, the test dataset was
created from a third data source, i.e. the Pl@ntNet mobile application that
collects millions of plant image queries all over the world. This paper
presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge,
summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating research
groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

TL;DR: 本文提出TasselNetV4模型，将植物计数从物种特定计数转向跨物种计数，结合TasselNet的局部计数思想和类无关计数的提取-匹配范式，在跨场景、跨尺度和跨物种植物计数方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统植物计数方法需要为每种植物构建特定模型，但植物种类繁多且不断有新变种出现，这种物种依赖的计数模型不可持续。植物具有动态变化特性，现有类无关计数模型对非刚性植物结构的计数效果不佳。

Method: 基于TasselNet模型扩展，结合视觉Transformer和多分支框感知局部计数器，增强跨尺度鲁棒性。采用提取-匹配范式，将局部计数思想与类无关计数相结合。

Result: 在PAC-105和PAC-Somalia两个挑战性数据集上的实验表明，TasselNetV4在计数性能和效率方面均优于最先进的类无关计数模型。

Conclusion: TasselNetV4成为跨场景、跨尺度和跨物种植物计数的视觉基础模型，为农业应用提供了更通用和可持续的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate plant counting provides valuable information for agriculture such as
crop yield prediction, plant density assessment, and phenotype quantification.
Vision-based approaches are currently the mainstream solution. Prior art
typically uses a detection or a regression model to count a specific plant.
However, plants have biodiversity, and new cultivars are increasingly bred each
year. It is almost impossible to exhaust and build all species-dependent
counting models. Inspired by class-agnostic counting (CAC) in computer vision,
we argue that it is time to rethink the problem formulation of plant counting,
from what plants to count to how to count plants. In contrast to most daily
objects with spatial and temporal invariance, plants are dynamic, changing with
time and space. Their non-rigid structure often leads to worse performance than
counting rigid instances like heads and cars such that current CAC and
open-world detection models are suboptimal to count plants. In this work, we
inherit the vein of the TasselNet plant counting model and introduce a new
extension, TasselNetV4, shifting from species-specific counting to
cross-species counting. TasselNetV4 marries the local counting idea of
TasselNet with the extract-and-match paradigm in CAC. It builds upon a plain
vision transformer and incorporates novel multi-branch box-aware local counters
used to enhance cross-scale robustness. Two challenging datasets, PAC-105 and
PAC-Somalia, are harvested. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art CAC
models show that TasselNetV4 achieves not only superior counting performance
but also high efficiency.Our results indicate that TasselNetV4 emerges to be a
vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant
counting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视网膜OCT分割方法存在三个主要问题：产生解剖学不合理分割、未能有效建模层-病变相互作用、缺乏拓扑正确性保证。这些限制影响了分割的准确性和临床实用性。

Method: 引入完全可微的生物标志物拓扑引擎，实现层和病变的双向影响联合学习，利用未标记和部分标记数据集。模型学习解耦表示，分离空间和风格因素，严格强制执行病变在解剖学合理位置的分割。

Result: 在公共和内部OCT数据集上的评估表明，该模型在病变和层分割方面均优于当前最先进方法，并展示了使用部分标注训练数据将层分割泛化到病理情况的能力。

Conclusion: 研究证明了在半监督学习中使用解剖约束进行准确、鲁棒和可信赖的视网膜生物标志物分割的潜力，为临床诊断提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is widely used for diagnosing and
monitoring retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
The segmentation of biomarkers such as layers and lesions is essential for
patient diagnosis and follow-up. Recently, semi-supervised learning has shown
promise in improving retinal segmentation performance. However, existing
methods often produce anatomically implausible segmentations, fail to
effectively model layer-lesion interactions, and lack guarantees on topological
correctness.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel semi-supervised model that
introduces a fully differentiable biomarker topology engine to enforce
anatomically correct segmentation of lesions and layers. This enables joint
learning with bidirectional influence between layers and lesions, leveraging
unlabeled and diverse partially labeled datasets. Our model learns a
disentangled representation, separating spatial and style factors. This
approach enables more realistic layer segmentations and improves lesion
segmentation, while strictly enforcing lesion location in their anatomically
plausible positions relative to the segmented layers.
  We evaluate the proposed model on public and internal datasets of OCT scans
and show that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art in both lesion and
layer segmentation, while demonstrating the ability to generalize layer
segmentation to pathological cases using partially annotated training data. Our
results demonstrate the potential of using anatomical constraints in
semi-supervised learning for accurate, robust, and trustworthy retinal
biomarker segmentation.

Abstract: The LifeCLEF plant identification challenge aims at evaluating plant
identification methods and systems at a very large scale, close to the
conditions of a real-world biodiversity monitoring scenario. The 2016-th
edition was actually conducted on a set of more than 110K images illustrating
1000 plant species living in West Europe, built through a large-scale
participatory sensing platform initiated in 2011 and which now involves tens of
thousands of contributors. The main novelty over the previous years is that the
identification task was evaluated as an open-set recognition problem, i.e. a
problem in which the recognition system has to be robust to unknown and never
seen categories. Beyond the brute-force classification across the known classes
of the training set, the big challenge was thus to automatically reject the
false positive classification hits that are caused by the unknown classes. This
overview presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the
challenge, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating
research groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

Motivation: 现有方法使用图像描述辅助LLMs理解图像，但描述中包含过多与问题无关的噪声，且LLMs通常不理解VQA任务，限制了推理能力。

Method: 使用预训练视觉语言模型生成图像描述，通过生成上下文示例、总结和重排描述来排除无关信息，帮助LLMs更好地理解图像和问题。

Result: 在6.7B参数的LLM上，SCRA-VQA在OK-VQA和A-OKVQA数据集上分别达到38.8%和34.6%的准确率。

Conclusion: SCRA-VQA通过改进图像描述处理方式，有效提升了LLMs在知识视觉问答任务中的推理能力和适应性。

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality knowledge is a central focus in Knowledge-Based Visual
Question Answering (KB-VQA). Recent methods use large language models (LLMs) as
knowledge engines for answering. These methods generally employ image captions
as visual text descriptions to assist LLMs in interpreting images. However, the
captions frequently include excessive noise irrelevant to the question, and
LLMs generally do not comprehend VQA tasks, limiting their reasoning
capabilities. To address this issue, we propose the Summarized Caption-Rerank
Augmented VQA (SCRA-VQA), which employs a pre-trained visual language model to
convert images into captions. Moreover, SCRA-VQA generates contextual examples
for the captions while simultaneously summarizing and reordering them to
exclude unrelated information. The caption-rerank process enables LLMs to
understand the image information and questions better, thus enhancing the
model's reasoning ability and task adaptability without expensive end-to-end
training. Based on an LLM with 6.7B parameters, SCRA-VQA performs excellently
on two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets: OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, achieving
accuracies of 38.8% and 34.6%. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 本文揭示了感知优化与评估之间的不对称性：在图像质量评估中表现优异的保真度指标不一定适用于感知优化，这种不对齐在对抗训练下更加明显。判别器设计对优化效果起决定性作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索感知优化目标（保真度目标和对抗目标）作为优化目标的有效性与作为图像质量评估指标能力之间的相关性，这一关联性尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 系统分析保真度指标和对抗目标在感知优化和图像质量评估中的表现差异，研究判别器设计对优化效果的影响。

Result: 发现感知优化与评估存在不对称性；判别器能有效抑制优化过程中的伪影，但其学习表示作为IQA模型骨干初始化时效果有限；判别器设计对优化效果起决定性作用，补丁级和卷积架构比传统或基于Transformer的替代方案提供更忠实的细节重建。

Conclusion: 这些发现推进了对损失函数设计及其与IQA可迁移性连接的理解，为更原则性的感知优化方法铺平了道路。

Abstract: Perceptual optimization is primarily driven by the fidelity objective, which
enforces both semantic consistency and overall visual realism, while the
adversarial objective provides complementary refinement by enhancing perceptual
sharpness and fine-grained detail. Despite their central role, the correlation
between their effectiveness as optimization objectives and their capability as
image quality assessment (IQA) metrics remains underexplored. In this work, we
conduct a systematic analysis and reveal an unanticipated asymmetry between
perceptual optimization and assessment: fidelity metrics that excel in IQA are
not necessarily effective for perceptual optimization, with this misalignment
emerging more distinctly under adversarial training. In addition, while
discriminators effectively suppress artifacts during optimization, their
learned representations offer only limited benefits when reused as backbone
initializations for IQA models. Beyond this asymmetry, our findings further
demonstrate that discriminator design plays a decisive role in shaping
optimization, with patch-level and convolutional architectures providing more
faithful detail reconstruction than vanilla or Transformer-based alternatives.
These insights advance the understanding of loss function design and its
connection to IQA transferability, paving the way for more principled
approaches to perceptual optimization.

Result: 在VQA-CP v1和v2数据集上表现优异，特别在处理有偏见和不平衡数据分布方面优于现有方法

Conclusion: 同时处理对象交互和数据集偏见对于推进VQA任务至关重要，IOG-VQA为此提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) presents a unique challenge by requiring
models to understand and reason about visual content to answer questions
accurately. Existing VQA models often struggle with biases introduced by the
training data, leading to over-reliance on superficial patterns and inadequate
generalization to diverse questions and images. This paper presents a novel
model, IOG-VQA, which integrates Object Interaction Self-Attention and
GAN-Based Debiasing to enhance VQA model performance. The self-attention
mechanism allows our model to capture complex interactions between objects
within an image, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the visual
context. Meanwhile, the GAN-based debiasing framework generates unbiased data
distributions, helping the model to learn more robust and generalizable
features. By leveraging these two components, IOG-VQA effectively combines
visual and textual information to address the inherent biases in VQA datasets.
Extensive experiments on the VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets demonstrate that
our model shows excellent performance compared with the existing methods,
particularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions highlighting
the importance of addressing both object interactions and dataset biases in
advancing VQA tasks. Our code is available at

Motivation: 视频序列中的结构化噪声和背景伪影会掩盖动态内容，传统RPCA方法的稀疏性假设无法捕捉真实视频数据的丰富变化。

Method: 集成低秩时间建模与扩散后验采样的混合框架，通过核范数正则化和扩散模型先验来改进视频分解。

Result: 在心脏超声去雾任务中，相比传统RPCA方法，在对比度增强（gCNR）和信号保持（KS统计量）方面表现出更好的去雾性能。

Conclusion: 结合基于模型的时间模型和深度生成先验的方法在高保真视频恢复方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Video sequences often contain structured noise and background artifacts that
obscure dynamic content, posing challenges for accurate analysis and
restoration. Robust principal component methods address this by decomposing
data into low-rank and sparse components. Still, the sparsity assumption often
fails to capture the rich variability present in real video data. To overcome
this limitation, a hybrid framework that integrates low-rank temporal modeling
with diffusion posterior sampling is proposed. The proposed method, Nuclear
Diffusion, is evaluated on a real-world medical imaging problem, namely cardiac
ultrasound dehazing, and demonstrates improved dehazing performance compared to
traditional RPCA concerning contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation
(KS statistic). These results highlight the potential of combining model-based
temporal models with deep generative priors for high-fidelity video
restoration.

Method: 利用基于马尔可夫随机场的局部像素依赖特性，重建合成图像以暴露纹理连续性和边缘一致性的破坏。基于此提出FerretNet，一个仅110万参数的轻量级神经网络。

Result: FerretNet仅在4类ProGAN数据集上训练，在包含22个生成模型的开放世界基准测试中达到97.1%的平均准确率，比现有最优方法高出10.6%。

Conclusion: FerretNet提供了一种高效且鲁棒的合成图像检测解决方案，证明了通过分析生成过程中的特定伪影可以实现出色的检测性能。

Abstract: The increasing realism of synthetic images generated by advanced models such
as VAEs, GANs, and LDMs poses significant challenges for synthetic image
detection. To address this issue, we explore two artifact types introduced
during the generation process: (1) latent distribution deviations and (2)
decoding-induced smoothing effects, which manifest as inconsistencies in local
textures, edges, and color transitions. Leveraging local pixel dependencies
(LPD) properties rooted in Markov Random Fields, we reconstruct synthetic
images using neighboring pixel information to expose disruptions in texture
continuity and edge coherence. Building upon LPD, we propose FerretNet, a
lightweight neural network with only 1.1M parameters that delivers efficient
and robust synthetic image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FerretNet, trained exclusively on the 4-class ProGAN dataset, achieves an
average accuracy of 97.1% on an open-world benchmark comprising across 22
generative models, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 10.6%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoTIF是一个基于transformer架构的概念瓶颈模型，专门为视频分类设计，能够处理任意长度的视频序列，通过全局概念重要性、局部概念相关性和时间依赖性三个视角来提升视频动作识别的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概念瓶颈模型主要针对静态图像，无法有效处理视频数据中的时间依赖性，而视频中的动作和事件识别需要捕捉概念在时间维度上的变化模式。

Method: 提出MoTIF框架，将概念瓶颈模型扩展到视频领域，识别视频中重复出现的时间模式（motifs），通过transformer架构处理任意长度的视频序列，提供全局、局部和时间三个层面的概念分析。

Result: 实验结果表明，概念建模范式可以有效地迁移到视频数据，在保持竞争力的性能的同时，能够更好地理解概念在时间上下文中的贡献。

Conclusion: MoTIF成功地将概念瓶颈模型扩展到视频分类任务，为视频动作识别提供了更深入的可解释性分析框架，代码已在GitHub开源。

Abstract: Conceptual models such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have driven
substantial progress in improving interpretability for image classification by
leveraging human-interpretable concepts. However, extending these models from
static images to sequences of images, such as video data, introduces a
significant challenge due to the temporal dependencies inherent in videos,
which are essential for capturing actions and events. In this work, we
introduce MoTIF (Moving Temporal Interpretable Framework), an architectural
design inspired by a transformer that adapts the concept bottleneck framework
for video classification and handles sequences of arbitrary length. Within the
video domain, concepts refer to semantic entities such as objects, attributes,
or higher-level components (e.g., 'bow', 'mount', 'shoot') that reoccur across
time - forming motifs collectively describing and explaining actions. Our
design explicitly enables three complementary perspectives: global concept
importance across the entire video, local concept relevance within specific
windows, and temporal dependencies of a concept over time. Our results
demonstrate that the concept-based modeling paradigm can be effectively
transferred to video data, enabling a better understanding of concept
contributions in temporal contexts while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Few-shot multispectral object detection (FSMOD) addresses the challenge of
detecting objects across visible and thermal modalities with minimal annotated
data. In this paper, we explore this complex task and introduce a framework
named "FSMODNet" that leverages cross-modality feature integration to improve
detection performance even with limited labels. By effectively combining the
unique strengths of visible and thermal imagery using deformable attention, the
proposed method demonstrates robust adaptability in complex illumination and
environmental conditions. Experimental results on two public datasets show
effective object detection performance in challenging low-data regimes,
outperforming several baselines we established from state-of-the-art models.

TL;DR: 提出使用粒子滤波器解决基于相机测量的3D物体定位问题，特别适用于远距离物体或计算资源受限的场景，如无人机野火监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无人机野火监测等安全关键任务中，需要对检测到的物体进行3D定位。传统方法如密集深度估计或3D场景重建在远距离物体或计算资源受限的情况下不可行。

Method: 使用粒子滤波器处理单目标和多目标场景的3D定位问题，基于相机位姿和图像分割序列进行定位，方法独立于检测方法。

Result: 通过3D模拟和基于GNSS的无人机图像分割序列验证，粒子滤波器能够在其他方法失效的情况下成功解决实际定位任务。

Conclusion: 粒子滤波器是解决基于相机测量的3D定位问题的有效方法，特别适用于无人机野火监测等应用场景，具有灵活性和实用性。

Abstract: 3D object localisation based on a sequence of camera measurements is
essential for safety-critical surveillance tasks, such as drone-based wildfire
monitoring. Localisation of objects detected with a camera can typically be
solved with dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction. However, in the
context of distant objects or tasks limited by the amount of available
computational resources, neither solution is feasible. In this paper, we show
that the task can be solved using particle filters for both single and multiple
target scenarios. The method was studied using a 3D simulation and a
drone-based image segmentation sequence with global navigation satellite system
(GNSS)-based camera pose estimates. The results showed that a particle filter
can be used to solve practical localisation tasks based on camera poses and
image segments in these situations where other solutions fail. The particle
filter is independent of the detection method, making it flexible for new
tasks. The study also demonstrates that drone-based wildfire monitoring can be
conducted using the proposed method paired with a pre-existing image
segmentation model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SwinMamba框架，结合局部扫描和全局扫描，用于遥感图像语义分割，在LoveDA和ISPRS Potsdam数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像语义分割面临高空间分辨率、复杂场景结构和多尺度对象等挑战。Vision Mamba虽然具有全局感受野和低计算复杂度，但过度依赖全局扫描会忽略关键的局部特征（如纹理和边缘），影响分割精度。

Method: 受Swin Transformer启发，提出SwinMamba框架。前两个阶段进行局部扫描以捕捉细粒度细节，后两个阶段利用全局扫描融合更广泛的上下文信息。采用重叠移位窗口增强区域间信息交换，实现更鲁棒的特征整合。

Result: 在LoveDA和ISPRS Potsdam数据集上的大量实验表明，SwinMamba优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SwinMamba通过结合局部和全局特征感知，为遥感图像语义分割提供了有效的解决方案，显示出其优越性和潜力。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery is a fundamental task in
computer vision, supporting a wide range of applications such as land use
classification, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. However, this
task is often challenged by the high spatial resolution, complex scene
structures, and diverse object scales present in remote sensing data. To
address these challenges, various deep learning architectures have been
proposed, including convolutional neural networks, Vision Transformers, and the
recently introduced Vision Mamba. Vision Mamba features a global receptive
field and low computational complexity, demonstrating both efficiency and
effectiveness in image segmentation. However, its reliance on global scanning
tends to overlook critical local features, such as textures and edges, which
are essential for achieving accurate segmentation in remote sensing contexts.
To tackle this limitation, we propose SwinMamba, a novel framework inspired by
the Swin Transformer. SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning
within shifted windows with a global receptive field, to enhance the model's
perception of both local and global features. Specifically, the first two
stages of SwinMamba perform local scanning to capture fine-grained details,
while its subsequent two stages leverage global scanning to fuse broader
contextual information. In our model, the use of overlapping shifted windows
enhances inter-region information exchange, facilitating more robust feature
integration across the entire image. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA and
ISPRS Potsdam datasets demonstrate that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, underscoring its effectiveness and potential as a superior solution
for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于打包的多实例学习框架，用于解决计算病理学中全切片图像序列长度极端变化、数据异构性和监督有限的问题，通过打包采样和残差分支等方法提高训练效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学中的全切片图像具有极长的序列长度（高达20万）、显著的序列长度变化（200到20万）和有限的监督，导致数据高度异构和冗余，传统方法在有限监督下难以有效处理这种异构性。

Method: 提出包基多实例学习框架：1）将采样的变长特征序列打包成固定长度序列以支持批处理训练；2）引入残差分支将多个切片的丢弃特征组合成超切片进行训练；3）使用注意力驱动的下采样器压缩特征以减少冗余。

Result: 在PANDA(UNI)数据集上实现了高达8%的准确率提升，同时仅使用12%的训练时间。

Conclusion: 专注于解决计算病理学中的数据挑战在基础模型时代具有重要潜力，所提出的方法能有效处理序列长度变化和有限监督问题。

Abstract: Computational pathology (CPath) digitizes pathology slides into whole slide
images (WSIs), enabling analysis for critical healthcare tasks such as cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths
(up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited
supervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data
heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training
efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited
supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a
pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature
sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving
data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes
discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with
tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature
loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to
compress features in both branches to reduce redundancy. By alleviating these
challenges, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8% while
using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that focusing data challenges in CPath holds significant potential
in the era of foundation models. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将基于模拟器的运动投影层整合到扩散过程中以确保物理合理性，但这些方法由于模拟器的顺序性质而计算成本高昂，无法并行化。

Method: 将模拟器运动投影解释为扩散过程中的一种引导形式，提出SimDiff模型，通过将环境参数（如重力、风力）直接条件化到去噪过程中，实现物理约束。

Result: SimDiff能够高效生成物理合理的运动，无需推理时的重复模拟器调用，并提供对不同物理系数的细粒度控制。

Conclusion: SimDiff成功泛化到未见过的环境参数组合，展示了组合泛化能力，为物理合理的人体运动生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Generating physically plausible human motion is crucial for applications such
as character animation and virtual reality. Existing approaches often
incorporate a simulator-based motion projection layer to the diffusion process
to enforce physical plausibility. However, such methods are computationally
expensive due to the sequential nature of the simulator, which prevents
parallelization. We show that simulator-based motion projection can be
interpreted as a form of guidance, either classifier-based or classifier-free,
within the diffusion process. Building on this insight, we propose SimDiff, a
Simulator-constrained Diffusion Model that integrates environment parameters
(e.g., gravity, wind) directly into the denoising process. By conditioning on
these parameters, SimDiff generates physically plausible motions efficiently,
without repeated simulator calls at inference, and also provides fine-grained
control over different physical coefficients. Moreover, SimDiff successfully
generalizes to unseen combinations of environmental parameters, demonstrating
compositional generalization.

Motivation: 研究视觉模型对高斯噪声的鲁棒性，分析架构设计选择对鲁棒性的影响，将经验观察转化为可操作的设计规则。

Method: 对1174个预训练视觉模型进行广泛评估，识别鲁棒性设计模式；开发理论分析解释观察到的相关性，包括低通滤波器、下采样、池化操作和预处理方法的影响。

Result: 识别出四个提高鲁棒性的设计模式：更大的stem核、更小的输入分辨率、平均池化、监督ViT而非CLIP ViT，可获得506位排名提升和21.6%准确率增益；理论分析证实了这些发现的因果机制。

Conclusion: 研究将鲁棒性分解为可解释的模块，提供了理论解释和实用的即插即用设计指南，有助于设计对高斯噪声更鲁棒的视觉模型。

Abstract: While the robustness of vision models is often measured, their dependence on
specific architectural design choices is rarely dissected. We investigate why
certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian
noise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design
rules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained
vision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for
improved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input
resolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather
than CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\%p accuracy
gains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings,
converting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that
low-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically
with kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy
roughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we
demonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion
to the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that
grows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error
and greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the
vulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller
normalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case
sensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing
common in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into
interpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and
build practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more
robust against Gaussian noise.

Abstract: Scene graphs (SGs) provide structured relational representations crucial for
decoding complex, dynamic surgical environments. This PRISMA-ScR-guided scoping
review systematically maps the evolving landscape of SG research in surgery,
charting its applications, methodological advancements, and future directions.
Our analysis reveals rapid growth, yet uncovers a critical 'data divide':
internal-view research (e.g., triplet recognition) almost exclusively uses
real-world 2D video, while external-view 4D modeling relies heavily on
simulated data, exposing a key translational research gap. Methodologically,
the field has advanced from foundational graph neural networks to specialized
foundation models that now significantly outperform generalist large
vision-language models in surgical contexts. This progress has established SGs
as a cornerstone technology for both analysis, such as workflow recognition and
automated safety monitoring, and generative tasks like controllable surgical
simulation. Although challenges in data annotation and real-time implementation
persist, they are actively being addressed through emerging techniques.
Surgical SGs are maturing into an essential semantic bridge, enabling a new

Abstract: We present an automated vision-based system for defect detection and
classification of laser power meter sensor coatings. Our approach addresses the
critical challenge of identifying coating defects such as thermal damage and
scratches that can compromise laser energy measurement accuracy in medical and
industrial applications. The system employs an unsupervised anomaly detection
framework that trains exclusively on ``good'' sensor images to learn normal
coating distribution patterns, enabling detection of both known and novel
defect types without requiring extensive labeled defect datasets. Our
methodology consists of three key components: (1) a robust preprocessing
pipeline using Laplacian edge detection and K-means clustering to segment the
area of interest, (2) synthetic data augmentation via StyleGAN2, and (3) a
UFlow-based neural network architecture for multi-scale feature extraction and
anomaly map generation. Experimental evaluation on 366 real sensor images
demonstrates $93.8\%$ accuracy on defective samples and $89.3\%$ accuracy on
good samples, with image-level AUROC of 0.957 and pixel-level AUROC of 0.961.
The system provides potential annual cost savings through automated quality

Abstract: The dynamic propagation of social media has broadened the reach of financial
advisory content through podcast videos, yet extracting insights from lengthy,
multimodal segments (30-40 minutes) remains challenging. We introduce FASTER
(Financial Advisory Summariser with Textual Embedded Relevant images), a
modular framework that tackles three key challenges: (1) extracting
modality-specific features, (2) producing optimized, concise summaries, and (3)
aligning visual keyframes with associated textual points. FASTER employs BLIP
for semantic visual descriptions, OCR for textual patterns, and Whisper-based
transcription with Speaker diarization as BOS features. A modified Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO)-based loss function, equipped with BOS-specific
fact-checking, ensures precision, relevance, and factual consistency against
the human-aligned summary. A ranker-based retrieval mechanism further aligns
keyframes with summarized content, enhancing interpretability and cross-modal
coherence. To acknowledge data resource scarcity, we introduce Fin-APT, a
dataset comprising 470 publicly accessible financial advisory pep-talk videos
for robust multimodal research. Comprehensive cross-domain experiments confirm
FASTER's strong performance, robustness, and generalizability when compared to

TL;DR: ASD是一种适配器，使SSL学习器能够在无需任何先决条件的情况下进行深度图像聚类的冷启动，通过伪标记数据和实例级分类器实现聚类级标签分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的将SSL技术集成到深度聚类框架中的方法都需要预训练、聚类学习或训练好的聚类模型作为先决条件，限制了SSL学习器在图像聚类任务中的灵活性和即插即用应用。

Method: 1. 从所有未标记数据中随机采样伪标记数据，设置实例级分类器学习语义对齐的实例级标签；2. 利用实例级分类能力跟踪未标记数据预测的类别转换，提取实例级类别的高层相似性；3. 使用分配的聚类级标签的伪标记数据触发在未标记数据上训练的通用SSL学习器进行图像聚类。

Result: ASD在各种基准测试中表现出优于最新深度图像聚类方法的性能，与使用真实标签的SSL方法相比仅有很小的精度差距（如CIFAR-10上仅差1.33%），并且还能进一步提升现有SSL嵌入深度图像聚类方法的性能。

Conclusion: ASD提供了一种无需先决条件的冷启动解决方案，使SSL学习器能够灵活应用于图像聚类任务，取得了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Recently, some works integrate SSL techniques into deep clustering frameworks
to enhance image clustering performance. However, they all need pretraining,
clustering learning, or a trained clustering model as prerequisites, limiting
the flexible and out-of-box application of SSL learners in the image clustering
task. This work introduces ASD, an adaptor that enables the cold-start of SSL
learners for deep image clustering without any prerequisites. Specifically, we
first randomly sample pseudo-labeled data from all unlabeled data, and set an
instance-level classifier to learn them with semantically aligned
instance-level labels. With the ability of instance-level classification, we
track the class transitions of predictions on unlabeled data to extract
high-level similarities of instance-level classes, which can be utilized to
assign cluster-level labels to pseudo-labeled data. Finally, we use the
pseudo-labeled data with assigned cluster-level labels to trigger a general SSL
learner trained on the unlabeled data for image clustering. We show the
superior performance of ASD across various benchmarks against the latest deep
image clustering approaches and very slight accuracy gaps compared to SSL
methods using ground-truth, e.g., only 1.33% on CIFAR-10. Moreover, ASD can
also further boost the performance of existing SSL-embedded deep image
clustering methods.

Motivation: Vision Transformer作为视觉基础模型会产生高范数伪影，这些伪影在知识蒸馏过程中会主导目标函数，导致学生模型过度拟合伪影而忽略信息信号，限制了大型模型的增益

Method: 使用基于LoRA的适配器实现零空间引导的扰动，在教师特征精炼过程中保持信息同时抑制伪影，然后将精炼后的教师特征蒸馏给学生模型

Result: 实验表明SiNGER能持续提升学生模型性能，在多个下游任务中达到最先进水平，并产生更清晰、更可解释的表征

Conclusion: SiNGER框架有效解决了教师特征中伪影抑制和信息保留之间的权衡问题，为知识蒸馏提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Vision Transformers are widely adopted as the backbone of vision foundation
models, but they are known to produce high-norm artifacts that degrade
representation quality. When knowledge distillation transfers these features to
students, high-norm artifacts dominate the objective, so students overfit to
artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the gains from
larger models. Prior work attempted to remove artifacts but encountered an
inherent trade-off between artifact suppression and preserving informative
signals from teachers. To address this, we introduce Singular Nullspace-Guided
Energy Reallocation (SiNGER), a novel distillation framework that suppresses
artifacts while preserving informative signals. The key idea is principled
teacher feature refinement: during refinement, we leverage the nullspace-guided
perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Then, the
refined teacher's features are distilled to a student. We implement this
perturbation efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal
structural modification. Extensive experiments show that \oursname consistently
improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple
downstream tasks and producing clearer and more interpretable representations.

handling. It accepts arbitrary combinations of spectral bands and their
wavelengths, producing fixed-size feature maps that feed into a compact,
quantized segmentation model based on a modified U-Net. The module runs
efficiently on embedded CPUs using Apache TVM, while the segmentation model is
deployed on FPGA, forming a CPU-FPGA hybrid pipeline suitable for
space-qualified hardware. Evaluations on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 datasets
demonstrate accurate segmentation across diverse input configurations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于单神经元的概念擦除方法（SNCE），通过操纵单个神经元来精确防止有害内容生成，同时最小化对图像质量的损害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型在图像生成方面表现出卓越能力，但也存在生成有害内容的安全风险。现有概念擦除方法的关键挑战是在精确移除目标概念的同时最小化图像质量的退化。

Method: 训练稀疏自编码器（SAE）将文本嵌入映射到稀疏、解耦的潜在空间，其中单个神经元与原子语义概念紧密对齐。设计基于激活模式调制频率评分的新型神经元识别方法，通过抑制有害概念特定神经元的激活来实现精确概念擦除。

Conclusion: SNCE方法通过单神经元操作实现了精确的概念擦除，在保持图像质量的同时有效防止有害内容生成，为文本到图像模型的安全应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image models exhibit remarkable capabilities in image generation.
However, they also pose safety risks of generating harmful content. A key
challenge of existing concept erasure methods is the precise removal of target
concepts while minimizing degradation of image quality. In this paper, we
propose Single Neuron-based Concept Erasure (SNCE), a novel approach that can
precisely prevent harmful content generation by manipulating only a single
neuron. Specifically, we train a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to map text
embeddings into a sparse, disentangled latent space, where individual neurons
align tightly with atomic semantic concepts. To accurately locate neurons
responsible for harmful concepts, we design a novel neuron identification
method based on the modulated frequency scoring of activation patterns. By
suppressing activations of the harmful concept-specific neuron, SNCE achieves
surgical precision in concept erasure with minimal disruption to image quality.
Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that SNCE achieves
state-of-the-art results in target concept erasure, while preserving the
model's generation capabilities for non-target concepts. Additionally, our
method exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, significantly
outperforming existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出KDSS算法用于生物点云的下采样，无需对输入数据进行下采样即可实现全分辨率点云分割，适用于不同传感器和植物物种


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有植物器官点云分割方法存在物种和传感器特异性，且通常需要大量预处理和下采样来满足硬件或神经网络输入要求

Method: KDSS（K-Dimensional Sub-Sampling）算法，一种轻量级的保持分辨率的下采样方法

Result: 结合KDSS与现有最先进分割模型，在不同传感器（摄影测量、激光三角测量、LiDAR）和植物物种上均获得满意结果

Conclusion: KDSS可作为密集预处理和下采样方法的轻量级替代方案，适用于任何植物物种和传感器模态的器官分割

Abstract: Accurate point cloud segmentation for plant organs is crucial for 3D plant
phenotyping. Existing solutions are designed problem-specific with a focus on
certain plant species or specified sensor-modalities for data acquisition.
Furthermore, it is common to use extensive pre-processing and down-sample the
plant point clouds to meet hardware or neural network input size requirements.
We propose a simple, yet effective algorithm KDSS for sub-sampling of
biological point clouds that is agnostic to sensor data and plant species. The
main benefit of this approach is that we do not need to down-sample our input
data and thus, enable segmentation of the full-resolution point cloud.
Combining KD-SS with current state-of-the-art segmentation models shows
satisfying results evaluated on different modalities such as photogrammetry,
laser triangulation and LiDAR for various plant species. We propose KD-SS as
lightweight resolution-retaining alternative to intensive pre-processing and
down-sampling methods for plant organ segmentation regardless of used species
and sensor modality.

TL;DR: Mambo是一个新的FG-BG分解框架，用于解决少样本分布外检测中现有方法对局部类别相似性过度依赖和固定背景补丁提取策略的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的FG-BG分解方法在少样本分布外检测中往往因为过度依赖局部类别相似性和固定的背景补丁提取策略而导致鲁棒性较低。

Method: 首先学习背景提示来获取包含背景和图像语义信息的局部背景相似性，然后使用局部类别相似性来细化局部背景相似性。同时提出补丁自校准调优来考虑样本多样性，灵活选择不同样本的背景补丁数量。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，Mambo在OOD检测和近OOD检测设置方面相比SOTA方法取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: Mambo通过结合细化的局部背景相似性和局部类别相似性进行背景提取，减少了先前方法对局部类别相似性的依赖，并通过灵活的补丁选择策略解决了固定背景提取的问题。

Abstract: Existing foreground-background (FG-BG) decomposition methods for the few-shot
out-of-distribution (FS-OOD) detection often suffer from low robustness due to
over-reliance on the local class similarity and a fixed background patch
extraction strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a new FG-BG
decomposition framework, namely Mambo, for FS-OOD detection. Specifically, we
propose to first learn a background prompt to obtain the local background
similarity containing both the background and image semantic information, and
then refine the local background similarity using the local class similarity.
As a result, we use both the refined local background similarity and the local
class similarity to conduct background extraction, reducing the dependence of
the local class similarity in previous methods. Furthermore, we propose the
patch self-calibrated tuning to consider the sample diversity to flexibly
select numbers of background patches for different samples, and thus exploring
the issue of fixed background extraction strategies in previous methods.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed
Mambo achieves the best performance, compared to SOTA methods in terms of OOD
detection and near OOD detection setting. The source code will be released at
https://github.com/YuzunoKawori/Mambo.

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种图像分割数据集划分方法：IPS和WDES，用于解决随机划分导致的测试集不具代表性和模型评估偏差问题，特别适用于小规模、不平衡和低多样性的数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分割中随机划分数据集会导致测试集不具有代表性，造成评估偏差和模型泛化能力差。虽然分层采样在分类任务中有效，但由于分割数据的多标签结构和类别不平衡特性，将其扩展到分割任务具有挑战性。

Method: 提出了两种方法：1）IPS：基于标签感知的简单采样方法；2）WDES：基于遗传算法的新方法，通过最小化Wasserstein距离来优化数据集划分的标签分布相似性。WDES在足够多代的情况下具有全局最优性。

Result: 使用新提出的统计异质性指标评估，WDES相比随机采样能持续产生更具代表性的划分。在街景、医学影像和卫星图像等多种分割任务中应用WDES，能降低性能方差并改善模型评估效果。

Conclusion: WDES在处理小规模、不平衡和低多样性数据集时特别有价值，这些情况下传统划分策略最容易产生偏差。WDES方法能有效提高分割模型评估的可靠性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Random splitting of datasets in image segmentation often leads to
unrepresentative test sets, resulting in biased evaluations and poor model
generalization. While stratified sampling has proven effective for addressing
label distribution imbalance in classification tasks, extending these ideas to
segmentation remains challenging due to the multi-label structure and class
imbalance typically present in such data. Building on existing stratification
concepts, we introduce Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS), a straightforward,
label-aware sampling method tailored for segmentation tasks. Additionally, we
present Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES), a novel genetic
algorithm designed to minimize the Wasserstein distance, thereby optimizing the
similarity of label distributions across dataset splits. We prove that WDES is
globally optimal given enough generations. Using newly proposed statistical
heterogeneity metrics, we evaluate both methods against random sampling and
find that WDES consistently produces more representative splits. Applying WDES
across diverse segmentation tasks, including street scenes, medical imaging,
and satellite imagery, leads to lower performance variance and improved model
evaluation. Our results also highlight the particular value of WDES in handling
small, imbalanced, and low-diversity datasets, where conventional splitting
strategies are most prone to bias.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有细粒度分类模型依赖部件标注或自动注意力图，但部件方法存在局部特征表示不完整的问题。人类识别对象时还会形成语义关联，因此本文利用层次化语义关联作为监督信号。

Method: 提出EnGraf-Net模型，将语义关联结构化为层次结构（分类法）作为监督信号，构建端到端深度神经网络。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、CUB-200-2011和FGVC-Aircraft三个数据集上的实验表明，EnGraf-Net优于许多现有细粒度模型，与最先进的SOTA方法具有竞争性性能。

Conclusion: 利用语义层次结构作为监督信号可以有效提升细粒度分类性能，无需依赖裁剪技术或手动标注，为细粒度识别提供了新思路。

Abstract: Fine-grained classification models are designed to focus on the relevant
details necessary to distinguish highly similar classes, particularly when
intra-class variance is high and inter-class variance is low. Most existing
models rely on part annotations such as bounding boxes, part locations, or
textual attributes to enhance classification performance, while others employ
sophisticated techniques to automatically extract attention maps. We posit that
part-based approaches, including automatic cropping methods, suffer from an
incomplete representation of local features, which are fundamental for
distinguishing similar objects. While fine-grained classification aims to
recognize the leaves of a hierarchical structure, humans recognize objects by
also forming semantic associations. In this paper, we leverage semantic
associations structured as a hierarchy (taxonomy) as supervised signals within
an end-to-end deep neural network model, termed EnGraf-Net. Extensive
experiments on three well-known datasets CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and
FGVC-Aircraft demonstrate the superiority of EnGraf-Net over many existing
fine-grained models, showing competitive performance with the most recent
state-of-the-art approaches, without requiring cropping techniques or manual
annotations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习系统的广泛应用，其安全性成为关键问题。Vision Transformers在性能上优于CNN且对对抗扰动更具鲁棒性，但仍存在被对抗补丁攻击的漏洞，需要研究CNN对抗攻击技术在ViT上的可迁移性。

Method: 使用Creases Transformation（CT）技术设计现实对抗补丁，在人物分类任务中测试四个微调ViT模型的脆弱性，评估对抗攻击从CNN到ViT的迁移能力。

Result: 实验显示不同ViT模型的攻击成功率差异显著：google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k为40.04%，facebook/dino-vitb16高达99.97%，其他两个模型分别为66.40%和65.17%。

Conclusion: 证实了对抗补丁从CNN到ViT的跨架构可迁移性，预训练数据集规模和方法论强烈影响模型对对抗攻击的抵抗力。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on machine learning systems has made their security a
critical concern. Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the
decision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches
or misclassification of targets. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained
significant traction in modern machine learning due to increased 1) performance
compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 2) robustness against
adversarial perturbations. However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks,
particularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI
classification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing
realistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs.
non-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT)
technique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring
naturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of
adversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification
models. Experimental evaluation across four fine-tuned ViT models on a binary
person classification task reveals significant vulnerability variations: attack
success rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97%
(facebook/dino-vitb16), with google/vit-base-patch16-224 achieving 66.40% and
facebook/dinov3-vitb16 reaching 65.17%. These results confirm the
cross-architectural transferability of adversarial patches from CNNs to ViTs,
with pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influencing model
resilience to adversarial attacks.

Motivation: 现有的视频概念转移方法缺乏对视频不同组件的细粒度控制能力，难以实现精确可控的视频编辑和概念迁移。

Method: 提出空间分解（前景主体、背景、运动流）和时间步分解（Chain-of-Prompt机制），采用双流到单流的DiT架构，结合自监督预训练和LLM引导的渐进式生成。

Result: 在OpenAnimal数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在视觉保真度和可编辑性方面均优于现有基线，能够实现高质量可控的视频概念转移。

Conclusion: UniTransfer通过创新的分解架构和渐进式生成机制，为视频概念转移任务提供了有效的解决方案，在多个指标上表现出色。

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture UniTransfer, which introduces both spatial
and diffusion timestep decomposition in a progressive paradigm, achieving
precise and controllable video concept transfer. Specifically, in terms of
spatial decomposition, we decouple videos into three key components: the
foreground subject, the background, and the motion flow. Building upon this
decomposed formulation, we further introduce a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based
architecture for supporting fine-grained control over different components in
the videos. We also introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on
random masking to enhance the decomposed representation learning from
large-scale unlabeled video data. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought reasoning
paradigm, we further revisit the denoising diffusion process and propose a
Chain-of-Prompt (CoP) mechanism to achieve the timestep decomposition. We
decompose the denoising process into three stages of different granularity and
leverage large language models (LLMs) for stage-specific instructions to guide
the generation progressively. We also curate an animal-centric video dataset
called OpenAnimal to facilitate the advancement and benchmarking of research in
video concept transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse
reference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual
fidelity and editability. Web Page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖LLM推理分析静态视觉解析，受限于感知阶段的静态性。需要模拟人类在推理过程中的动态感知机制来提升MLLMs的推理能力。

Method: VTTS采用迭代感知（ITP）机制，结合强化学习和时空监督来优化推理。通过逐步聚焦高置信度时空区域，并基于更新的文本预测进行引导。

Result: 新提出的Videochat-R1.5模型在超过15个基准测试中平均提升超过5%，优于Qwen2.5VL-3B和-7B等基线模型，涵盖视频对话、视频推理和时空感知任务。

Conclusion: VTTS方法有效提升了MLLMs的推理性能，验证了迭代感知在增强模型推理能力方面的有效性，并具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Inducing reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is critical
for achieving human-level perception and understanding. Existing methods mainly
leverage LLM reasoning to analyze parsed visuals, often limited by static
perception stages. This paper introduces Visual Test-Time Scaling (VTTS), a
novel approach to enhance MLLMs' reasoning via iterative perception during
inference. VTTS mimics humans' hierarchical attention by progressively refining
focus on high-confidence spatio-temporal regions, guided by updated textual
predictions. Specifically, VTTS employs an Iterative Perception (ITP)
mechanism, incorporating reinforcement learning with spatio-temporal
supervision to optimize reasoning. To support this paradigm, we also present
VTTS-80K, a dataset tailored for iterative perception. These designs allows a
MLLM to enhance its performance by increasing its perceptual compute. Extensive
experiments validate VTTS's effectiveness and generalization across diverse
tasks and benchmarks. Our newly introduced Videochat-R1.5 model has achieved
remarkable improvements, with an average increase of over 5\%, compared to
robust baselines such as Qwen2.5VL-3B and -7B, across more than 15 benchmarks
that encompass video conversation, video reasoning, and spatio-temporal

Motivation: 理解DL模型学习内容对AI在临床环境中的安全部署至关重要。现有研究主要关注基于像素的解释方法，而较少关注模型学习的文本概念，这些概念可能更好地反映临床医生的推理过程。

Method: 利用乳腺摄影专用视觉语言模型（Mammo-CLIP）作为"解剖器"，在指定层用人类可解释的文本概念标记神经元，并量化其与领域知识的对齐程度。研究比较了不同训练数据和微调策略下模型的概念学习差异。

Result: 在乳腺摄影数据上训练的模型捕获更多临床相关概念，且与放射科医生工作流程更一致。针对特定任务的微调增强了某些概念类别（如良性钙化）的捕获，但可能减少其他类别（如密度相关特征）的覆盖范围。

Conclusion: Mammo-CLIP Dissect提供了CNN如何捕获乳腺摄影特定知识的见解，揭示了领域特定训练和任务特定适应如何塑造概念学习，在专业化和泛化之间存在权衡。

Abstract: Understanding what deep learning (DL) models learn is essential for the safe
deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical settings. While previous
work has focused on pixel-based explainability methods, less attention has been
paid to the textual concepts learned by these models, which may better reflect
the reasoning used by clinicians. We introduce Mammo-CLIP Dissect, the first
concept-based explainability framework for systematically dissecting DL vision
models trained for mammography. Leveraging a mammography-specific
vision-language model (Mammo-CLIP) as a "dissector," our approach labels
neurons at specified layers with human-interpretable textual concepts and
quantifies their alignment to domain knowledge. Using Mammo-CLIP Dissect, we
investigate three key questions: (1) how concept learning differs between DL
vision models trained on general image datasets versus mammography-specific
datasets; (2) how fine-tuning for downstream mammography tasks affects concept
specialisation; and (3) which mammography-relevant concepts remain
underrepresented. We show that models trained on mammography data capture more
clinically relevant concepts and align more closely with radiologists'
workflows than models not trained on mammography data. Fine-tuning for
task-specific classification enhances the capture of certain concept categories
(e.g., benign calcifications) but can reduce coverage of others (e.g.,
density-related features), indicating a trade-off between specialisation and
generalisation. Our findings show that Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights
into how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture mammography-specific
knowledge. By comparing models across training data and fine-tuning regimes, we
reveal how domain-specific training and task-specific adaptation shape concept
learning. Code and concept set are available:

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在视频推理中存在过程不一致问题，即使最终答案正确，中间推理过程也可能偏离视频动态，这影响了模型的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Method: 引入基于强化学习的MOSS-ChatV框架，采用动态时间规整的过程奖励来对齐推理轨迹与时间参考，无需辅助奖励模型。同时构建了MOSS-Video基准测试集。

Result: MOSS-ChatV在MOSS-Video测试集上达到87.2%的准确率，在MVBench和MMVU等通用视频基准上也有提升，且在不同架构模型上均表现一致。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效提升视频推理的过程一致性和稳定性，具有广泛的适用性，为视频推理任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Video reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), requiring models to move beyond static perception
toward coherent understanding of temporal dynamics in complex scenes. Yet
existing MLLMs often exhibit process inconsistency, where intermediate
reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when the final answer is correct,
undermining interpretability and robustness. To address this issue, we
introduce MOSS-ChatV, a reinforcement learning framework with a Dynamic Time
Warping (DTW)-based process reward. This rule-based reward aligns reasoning
traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process
supervision without auxiliary reward models. We further identify dynamic state
prediction as a key measure of video reasoning and construct MOSS-Video, a
benchmark with annotated reasoning traces, where the training split is used to
fine-tune MOSS-ChatV and the held-out split is reserved for evaluation.
MOSS-ChatV achieves 87.2\% on MOSS-Video (test) and improves performance on
general video benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU. The framework consistently
yields gains across different architectures, including Qwen2.5-VL and Phi-2,
confirming its broad applicability. Evaluations with GPT-4o-as-judge further
show that MOSS-ChatV produces more consistent and stable reasoning traces.

Result: 大量实验验证表明，该方法在性能上大幅优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过整合相机和物体运动为像素运动，能够有效生成符合相机轨迹且保持物体运动一致性的视频。

Abstract: Generating videos guided by camera trajectories poses significant challenges
in achieving consistency and generalizability, particularly when both camera
and object motions are present. Existing approaches often attempt to learn
these motions separately, which may lead to confusion regarding the relative
motion between the camera and the objects. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel approach that integrates both camera and object motions by
converting them into the motion of corresponding pixels. Utilizing a stable
diffusion network, we effectively learn reference motion maps in relation to
the specified camera trajectory. These maps, along with an extracted semantic
object prior, are then fed into an image-to-video network to generate the
desired video that can accurately follow the designated camera trajectory while
maintaining consistent object motions. Extensive experiments verify that our
model outperforms SOTA methods by a large margin.

Motivation: 随着图像生成AI的快速发展，合成图像与真实图像的界限变得模糊，引发了生成器与判别器之间的竞争。本文旨在探究判别器在何种条件下处于最不利地位。

Method: 使用Kolmogorov复杂度作为数据集内在结构的度量，分析数据维度和复杂度两个关键因素对判别器性能的影响。

Result: 研究表明：简单数据集几乎可以被生成器完美学习，高度多样化的数据集会掩盖缺陷，而中等复杂度数据集最有利于检测，因为生成器无法完全捕捉分布且错误仍然可见。

Conclusion: 数据复杂度对合成图像检测有重要影响，中等复杂度数据集为判别器提供了最有利的检测条件。

Abstract: The rapid progress of image generative AI has blurred the boundary between
synthetic and real images, fueling an arms race between generators and
discriminators. This paper investigates the conditions under which
discriminators are most disadvantaged in this competition. We analyze two key
factors: data dimensionality and data complexity. While increased
dimensionality often strengthens the discriminators ability to detect subtle
inconsistencies, complexity introduces a more nuanced effect. Using Kolmogorov
complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, we show that both very
simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic
images; generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, whereas extreme
diversity masks imperfections. In contrast, intermediate-complexity datasets
create the most favorable conditions for detection, as generators fail to fully
capture the distribution and their errors remain visible.

Conclusion: WAVECLIP通过小波基令牌化成功实现了自适应分辨率推理，为视觉语言模型提供了高效的多分辨率处理方案，在保持准确性的同时大幅降低计算需求。

Abstract: We introduce WAVECLIP, a single unified model for adaptive resolution
inference in CLIP, enabled by wavelet-based tokenization. WAVECLIP replaces
standard patch embeddings with a multi-level wavelet decomposition, enabling
the model to process images coarse to fine while naturally supporting multiple
resolutions within the same model. At inference time, the model begins with low
resolution tokens and refines only when needed, using key-value caching and
causal cross-level attention to reuse computation, effectively introducing to
the model only new information when needed. We evaluate WAVECLIP in zero-shot
classification, demonstrating that a simple confidence-based gating mechanism
enables adaptive early exits. This allows users to dynamically choose a
compute-accuracy trade-off using a single deployed model. Our approach requires
only lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher and achieves

*Aymen Bouguerra,Daniel Montoya,Alexandra Gomez-Villa,Fabio Arnez,Chokri Mraidha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文对CLIP模型的量化进行了大规模评估，发现量化不仅影响精度，还能改善校准性，甚至在某些情况下同时提升零样本精度、校准性和OOD鲁棒性，挑战了效率与性能必须权衡的传统观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CLIP等视觉语言模型在安全相关任务中展现出强大的零样本泛化能力，但量化对这些模型可靠部署的影响尚未得到充分研究，特别是在校准性和OOD检测等关键可靠性指标方面。

Method: 采用大规模量化评估方法，不仅评估分布内精度，还全面分析包括校准性和OOD检测在内的可靠性指标，并探索量化感知训练方法。

Result: 量化能持续改善预训练不足置信模型的校准性，但对过度置信模型可能降低校准性；有趣的是，校准性下降并不妨碍OOD检测的改进；某些QAT方法能同时提升零样本精度、校准性和OOD鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 量化可以超越传统效率提升角色，为部署高效、可靠、鲁棒的视觉语言模型提供多目标优化解决方案，打破了效率与性能必须权衡的固有认知。

Abstract: The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models
(VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for
the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still
overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance
beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale
evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution
accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing
counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that
quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident
pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants.
Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other
reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these
same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific
quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in
zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a
strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights
for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable,
and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CARINOX是一个统一的框架，结合了噪声优化和探索，通过基于人类判断相关性的奖励选择程序，提高文本到图像扩散模型的组合对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理时方法在优化初始噪声时存在局限性：优化可能因初始化不良或搜索轨迹不佳而停滞，而探索可能需要大量样本才能找到满意输出。单一奖励指标或临时组合无法可靠捕捉组合性的所有方面。

Method: CARINOX框架结合了噪声优化和探索，采用基于人类判断相关性的原则性奖励选择程序，在T2I-CompBench++和HRS基准测试上进行评估。

Result: CARINOX在T2I-CompBench++上将平均对齐分数提高了16%，在HRS基准测试上提高了11%，在所有主要类别中一致优于最先进的优化和基于探索的方法，同时保持图像质量和多样性。

Conclusion: CARINOX通过统一噪声优化和探索，并采用原则性奖励选择，有效解决了文本到图像扩散模型在复杂组合提示下的对齐问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, can produce
high-quality and diverse images but often fail to achieve compositional
alignment, particularly when prompts describe complex object relationships,
attributes, or spatial arrangements. Recent inference-time approaches address
this by optimizing or exploring the initial noise under the guidance of reward
functions that score text-image alignment without requiring model fine-tuning.
While promising, each strategy has intrinsic limitations when used alone:
optimization can stall due to poor initialization or unfavorable search
trajectories, whereas exploration may require a prohibitively large number of
samples to locate a satisfactory output. Our analysis further shows that
neither single reward metrics nor ad-hoc combinations reliably capture all
aspects of compositionality, leading to weak or inconsistent guidance. To
overcome these challenges, we present Category-Aware Reward-based Initial Noise
Optimization and Exploration (CARINOX), a unified framework that combines noise
optimization and exploration with a principled reward selection procedure
grounded in correlation with human judgments. Evaluations on two complementary
benchmarks covering diverse compositional challenges show that CARINOX raises
average alignment scores by +16% on T2I-CompBench++ and +11% on the HRS
benchmark, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art optimization and
exploration-based methods across all major categories, while preserving image
quality and diversity. The project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TABLET是一个大规模视觉表格理解数据集，包含400万个示例和200万个独特表格，其中88%保留原始可视化效果，旨在解决现有基准缺乏真实世界表格复杂性和视觉多样性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前表格理解基准主要使用合成渲染，缺乏真实世界表格的复杂性和视觉多样性，且现有VTU数据集提供固定示例和预定义指令，无法访问底层序列化数据进行重新表述。

Method: 引入TABLET数据集，包含配对的图像-HTML表示、全面元数据和溯源信息，通过微调视觉语言模型（如Qwen2.5-VL-7B）来提升VTU任务性能。

Result: 在TABLET上微调视觉语言模型提高了在已见和未见VTU任务上的性能，同时增强了在真实世界表格可视化上的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过保留原始可视化效果并在统一的大规模集合中维护示例可追溯性，TABLET为未来VTU模型的鲁棒训练和可扩展评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: While table understanding increasingly relies on pixel-only settings where
tables are processed as visual representations, current benchmarks
predominantly use synthetic renderings that lack the complexity and visual
diversity of real-world tables. Additionally, existing visual table
understanding (VTU) datasets offer fixed examples with single visualizations
and pre-defined instructions, providing no access to underlying serialized data
for reformulation. We introduce TABLET, a large-scale VTU dataset with 4
million examples across 20 tasks, grounded in 2 million unique tables where 88%
preserve original visualizations. Each example includes paired image-HTML
representations, comprehensive metadata, and provenance information linking
back to the source datasets. Fine-tuning vision-language models like
Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET improves performance on seen and unseen VTU tasks while
increasing robustness on real-world table visualizations. By preserving
original visualizations and maintaining example traceability in a unified
large-scale collection, TABLET establishes a foundation for robust training and
extensible evaluation of future VTU models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于共形预测的新方法，让用户能够直接控制生成解释的保真度，通过识别能够保持模型预测的显著特征子集，无需真实解释进行校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的特征归因方法在鲁棒性和忠实反映黑盒模型推理方面存在局限性，需要一种能够控制解释保真度的方法。

Method: 使用共形预测框架，提出四种一致性函数来量化解释与模型预测的符合程度，识别能够保持预测的显著特征子集。

Result: 在六个图像数据集上使用五种解释器进行实证评估，FastSHAP在保真度和信息效率方面表现最佳，基于超像素的一致性度量比基于像素的更有效。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可控的解释保真度机制，无需真实解释校准，在多个数据集上验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Feature attribution methods are widely used for explaining image-based
predictions, as they provide feature-level insights that can be intuitively
visualized. However, such explanations often vary in their robustness and may
fail to faithfully reflect the reasoning of the underlying black-box model. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel conformal prediction-based
approach that enables users to directly control the fidelity of the generated
explanations. The method identifies a subset of salient features that is
sufficient to preserve the model's prediction, regardless of the information
carried by the excluded features, and without demanding access to ground-truth
explanations for calibration. Four conformity functions are proposed to
quantify the extent to which explanations conform to the model's predictions.
The approach is empirically evaluated using five explainers across six image
datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that FastSHAP consistently
outperforms the competing methods in terms of both fidelity and informational
efficiency, the latter measured by the size of the explanation regions.
Furthermore, the results reveal that conformity measures based on super-pixels
are more effective than their pixel-wise counterparts.

*Muxin Pu,Mei Kuan Lim,Chun Yong Chong,Chen Change Loy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sigma是一个基于骨架的手语理解统一框架，通过多模态融合和分层对齐学习解决了当前方法的三个关键限制：语义基础薄弱、局部细节与全局上下文不平衡、跨模态学习效率低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于骨架的手语理解方法面临三个主要挑战：1）语义基础薄弱，模型难以将骨骼运动模式与语言意义关联；2）局部细节与全局上下文不平衡；3）跨模态学习效率低下。

Method: 提出Sigma框架，包含：1）手语感知的早期融合机制，促进视觉和文本模态的深度交互；2）分层对齐学习策略，在不同层次上最大化跨模态特征一致性；3）统一的预训练框架，结合对比学习、文本匹配和语言建模。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Sigma在手语孤立识别、连续手语识别和无注释手语翻译任务上取得了新的最先进结果，证明了语义信息预训练的有效性和骨架数据作为独立解决方案的潜力。

Conclusion: Sigma展示了语义信息预训练的重要性，证明了基于骨架的数据可以作为手语理解的独立有效解决方案，为多语言手语理解提供了统一框架。

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective for learning transferable features in sign
language understanding (SLU) tasks. Recently, skeleton-based methods have
gained increasing attention because they can robustly handle variations in
subjects and backgrounds without being affected by appearance or environmental
factors. Current SLU methods continue to face three key limitations: 1) weak
semantic grounding, as models often capture low-level motion patterns from
skeletal data but struggle to relate them to linguistic meaning; 2) imbalance
between local details and global context, with models either focusing too
narrowly on fine-grained cues or overlooking them for broader context; and 3)
inefficient cross-modal learning, as constructing semantically aligned
representations across modalities remains difficult. To address these, we
propose Sigma, a unified skeleton-based SLU framework featuring: 1) a
sign-aware early fusion mechanism that facilitates deep interaction between
visual and textual modalities, enriching visual features with linguistic
context; 2) a hierarchical alignment learning strategy that jointly maximises
agreements across different levels of paired features from different
modalities, effectively capturing both fine-grained details and high-level
semantic relationships; and 3) a unified pre-training framework that combines
contrastive learning, text matching and language modelling to promote semantic
consistency and generalisation. Sigma achieves new state-of-the-art results on
isolated sign language recognition, continuous sign language recognition, and
gloss-free sign language translation on multiple benchmarks spanning different
sign and spoken languages, demonstrating the impact of semantically informative
pre-training and the effectiveness of skeletal data as a stand-alone solution
for SLU.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文对文本-图像生成评估中广泛使用的自动化指标进行了全面研究，发现没有单一指标在所有任务中表现一致，指标性能随组合问题的类型而变化。VQA类指标虽然流行但并非普遍优越，而某些基于嵌入的指标在特定情况下表现更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本-图像生成技术发展迅速，但评估生成输出是否真正捕捉提示中的对象、属性和关系仍然是一个核心挑战。当前评估严重依赖自动化指标，但这些指标往往基于惯例或流行度而非经过人类判断验证。由于该领域的评估和报告进展直接依赖于这些指标，理解它们反映人类偏好的程度至关重要。

Method: 进行了一项广泛的研究，分析广泛使用的组合文本-图像评估指标。分析超越了简单的相关性，考察了这些指标在不同组合挑战中的行为，并比较了不同指标家族与人类判断的一致性。

Result: 结果显示没有单一指标在所有任务中表现一致：性能随组合问题的类型而变化。VQA类指标虽然流行但并非普遍优越，而某些基于嵌入的指标在特定情况下表现更强。仅基于图像的指标，如预期的那样，对组合评估贡献很小，因为它们是为感知质量而非对齐而设计的。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了仔细和透明地选择指标的重要性，既是为了可信的评估，也是为了将它们用作生成中的奖励模型。评估指标的选择需要根据具体的组合问题类型进行针对性考虑。

Abstract: Text-image generation has advanced rapidly, but assessing whether outputs
truly capture the objects, attributes, and relations described in prompts
remains a central challenge. Evaluation in this space relies heavily on
automated metrics, yet these are often adopted by convention or popularity
rather than validated against human judgment. Because evaluation and reported
progress in the field depend directly on these metrics, it is critical to
understand how well they reflect human preferences. To address this, we present
a broad study of widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation.
Our analysis goes beyond simple correlation, examining their behavior across
diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families
align with human judgments. The results show that no single metric performs
consistently across tasks: performance varies with the type of compositional
problem. Notably, VQA-based metrics, though popular, are not uniformly
superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific
cases. Image-only metrics, as expected, contribute little to compositional
evaluation, as they are designed for perceptual quality rather than alignment.
These findings underscore the importance of careful and transparent metric
selection, both for trustworthy evaluation and for their use as reward models
in generation. Project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了SlideMamba框架，将Mamba架构与图神经网络(GNN)相结合，通过基于熵的自适应融合策略来增强全切片图像(WSI)分析，在基因融合和突变状态预测任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学需要从全切片图像中提取有意义的表示来支持临床和生物学任务。现有方法难以同时捕捉局部空间关系和长距离上下文依赖关系。

Method: 提出SlideMamba框架，整合Mamba模块（擅长捕捉长距离全局依赖）和GNN（强调细粒度短距离空间交互），采用基于熵的置信度加权机制进行自适应融合。

Result: 在基因融合和突变状态预测任务中，SlideMamba达到PRAUC 0.751±0.05，显著优于MIL、Trans-MIL、Mamba-only、GNN-only和GAT-Mamba等方法，同时在ROC AUC、敏感性和特异性方面也表现优异。

Conclusion: 集成架构结合自适应融合策略显示出强大性能，为计算病理学中的空间分辨预测建模任务提供了有前景的应用潜力。

Abstract: Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting
meaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various
clinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep
learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture
both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies,
offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules
excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize
fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these
complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an
entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically
balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the
branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the
contextual importance of local versus global information for different
downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a
representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our
framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve
(PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39
\pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a
prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves
competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm
0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength
of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive
fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of
spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.

Motivation: 现有3D生成模型主要依赖图像或文本条件，缺乏细粒度的跨模态控制，限制了可控性和实际应用。

Method: 基于Hunyuan3D 2.1构建统一跨模态架构，采用渐进式难度感知采样策略，对每种控制信号进行统一处理。

Result: 实验表明额外控制信号提高了生成准确性，支持几何感知变换，并增强了生产工作流的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过多模态控制实现了更精确可控的3D资产生成，为实际应用提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D-native generative models have accelerated asset
creation for games, film, and design. However, most methods still rely
primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained, cross-modal
controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption. To address this
gap, we present Hunyuan3D-Omni, a unified framework for fine-grained,
controllable 3D asset generation built on Hunyuan3D 2.1. In addition to images,
Hunyuan3D-Omni accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose
priors as conditioning signals, enabling precise control over geometry,
topology, and pose. Instead of separate heads for each modality, our model
unifies all signals in a single cross-modal architecture. We train with a
progressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy that selects one control
modality per example and biases sampling toward harder signals (e.g., skeletal
pose) while downweighting easier ones (e.g., point clouds), encouraging robust
multi-modal fusion and graceful handling of missing inputs. Experiments show
that these additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable
geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production
workflows.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN经常利用表面相关性进行"作弊"预测，现有方法依赖专家标注，可扩展性有限。受认知科学启发，需要一种无需人工标注的注意力引导方法。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型通过自然语言提示自动生成语义注意力图，引入辅助损失函数使CNN注意力与语言引导的注意力图对齐。

Result: 在ColoredMNIST和DecoyMNIST数据集上达到最先进性能，表现出更好的泛化能力、减少对捷径的依赖，且模型注意力更符合人类直觉。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，能够在不依赖人工标注的情况下提升CNN的可靠性和认知合理性。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) frequently "cheat" by exploiting
superficial correlations, raising concerns about whether they make predictions
for the right reasons. Inspired by cognitive science, which highlights the role
of attention in robust human perception, recent methods have sought to guide
model attention using concept-based supervision and explanation regularization.
However, these techniques depend on labor-intensive, expert-provided
annotations, limiting their scalability. We propose a scalable framework that
leverages vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention
maps using natural language prompts. By introducing an auxiliary loss that
aligns CNN attention with these language-guided maps, our approach promotes
more reliable and cognitively plausible decision-making without manual
annotation. Experiments on challenging datasets, ColoredMNIST and DecoyMNIST,
show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ColorMNIST and
remains competitive with annotation-heavy baselines on DecoyMNIST,
demonstrating improved generalization, reduced shortcut reliance, and model
attention that better reflects human intuition.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical medical imaging modality in
clinical diagnosis and research, yet its complexity and heterogeneity pose
challenges for automated analysis, particularly in scalable and generalizable
machine learning applications. While foundation models have revolutionized
natural language and vision tasks, their application to MRI remains limited due
to data scarcity and narrow anatomical focus. In this work, we present
Decipher-MR, a 3D MRI-specific vision-language foundation model trained on a
large-scale dataset comprising 200,000 MRI series from over 22,000 studies
spanning diverse anatomical regions, sequences, and pathologies. Decipher-MR
integrates self-supervised vision learning with report-guided text supervision
to build robust, generalizable representations, enabling effective adaptation
across broad applications. To enable robust and diverse clinical tasks with
minimal computational overhead, Decipher-MR supports a modular design that
enables tuning of lightweight, task-specific decoders attached to a frozen
pretrained encoder. Following this setting, we evaluate Decipher-MR across
diverse benchmarks including disease classification, demographic prediction,
anatomical localization, and cross-modal retrieval, demonstrating consistent

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成图像感知的子问题有效提升了多步推理的准确性，解决了传统LLMs在视觉推理中的关键问题。

Abstract: The field of vision-language understanding has been actively researched in
recent years, thanks to the development of Large Language Models~(LLMs).
However, it still needs help with problems requiring multi-step reasoning, even
for very simple questions. Recent studies adopt LLMs to tackle this problem by
iteratively generating sub-questions and answers. However, there are
disadvantages such as 1) the fine-grained visual contents of images are not
available using LLMs that cannot read visual information, 2) internal
mechanisms are inaccessible and difficult to reproduce by using black-box LLMs.
To solve these problems, we propose the SQ (Self-Questioning)-InstructBLIP,
which improves inference performance by generating image-aware informative
sub-questions and sub-answers iteratively. The SQ-InstructBLIP, which consists
of a Questioner, Answerer, and Reasoner that share the same architecture.
Questioner and Answerer generate sub-questions and sub-answers to help infer
the main-question, and Reasoner performs reasoning on the main-question
considering the generated sub-question information. Our experiments show that
the proposed method SQ-InstructBLIP, which uses the generated sub-questions as
additional information when solving the VQA task, performs more accurate
reasoning than the previous works.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注提示与生成图像的匹配度，但忽视了模型基于先验知识或偏见生成超出提示内容的现象，这种现象在语言和视觉语言模型中已被研究，但在文本到图像生成领域尚未明确定义。

Method: 通过分析文本到图像生成模型的行为，提出了幻觉的三类分类法：属性幻觉（错误属性）、关系幻觉（错误关系）和对象幻觉（错误对象），并建立了评估的上界框架。

Result: 该框架能够揭示模型隐藏的偏见，为更丰富的文本到图像模型评估提供了基础。

Conclusion: 明确定义文本到图像生成中的幻觉现象对于全面评估模型性能至关重要，提出的分类框架有助于系统性地识别和分析模型偏见问题。

Abstract: In language and vision-language models, hallucination is broadly understood
as content generated from a model's prior knowledge or biases rather than from
the given input. While this phenomenon has been studied in those domains, it
has not been clearly framed for text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Existing
evaluations mainly focus on alignment, checking whether prompt-specified
elements appear, but overlook what the model generates beyond the prompt. We
argue for defining hallucination in T2I as bias-driven deviations and propose a
taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations.
This framing introduces an upper bound for evaluation and surfaces hidden
biases, providing a foundation for richer assessment of T2I models.

characteristics with a dual-branch design: the temporal branch applies
Wasserstein-regularized alignment to stabilize dynamic trajectories, while the
frequency branch introduces variance-guided perturbations to enhance robustness
against person-specific spectral differences. A consistency-driven fusion
mechanism integrates both branches. At the loss level, the Group-Invariant
Regularized Loss partitions samples into pseudo-groups to simulate unseen
person-specific distributions. By up-weighting boundary cases and regularizing
subgroup variance, it forces the model to generalize beyond easy or frequent
samples, thus enhancing robustness to difficult variations. Experiments on the
large-scale MA-52 dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing
methods in both accuracy and robustness, achieving stable generalization under
fine-grained conditions.

*Songlin Yang,Tianyi Wei,Yushi Lan,Zeqi Xiao,Anyi Rao,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于3D几何基础模型VGGT的语义匹配方法，解决了现有方法在几何歧义和最近邻规则方面的局限性，通过特征重用、语义头设计和数据增强策略实现了优越的几何感知和匹配性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义匹配方法存在两个主要问题：(i) 几何歧义：依赖2D基础模型特征难以区分对称结构，缺乏泛化能力；(ii) 最近邻规则：像素级匹配忽略跨图像不可见性和流形保持。需要几何感知的像素描述符和整体密集对应机制。

Method: 提出基于VGGT的语义匹配方法：(i) 重用早期特征阶段，微调后期阶段，添加语义头实现双向对应；(ii) 通过循环一致性训练策略、合成数据增强和渐进训练方案，在数据稀缺条件下适应语义匹配场景。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在几何感知、匹配可靠性和流形保持方面表现优异，超越了之前的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将3D几何基础模型VGGT应用于语义匹配任务，解决了现有方法的局限性，为语义匹配提供了更可靠的几何感知解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic matching aims to establish pixel-level correspondences between
instances of the same category and represents a fundamental task in computer
vision. Existing approaches suffer from two limitations: (i) Geometric
Ambiguity: Their reliance on 2D foundation model features (e.g., Stable
Diffusion, DINO) often fails to disambiguate symmetric structures, requiring
extra fine-tuning yet lacking generalization; (ii) Nearest-Neighbor Rule: Their
pixel-wise matching ignores cross-image invisibility and neglects manifold
preservation. These challenges call for geometry-aware pixel descriptors and
holistic dense correspondence mechanisms. Inspired by recent advances in 3D
geometric foundation models, we turn to VGGT, which provides geometry-grounded
features and holistic dense matching capabilities well aligned with these
needs. However, directly transferring VGGT is challenging, as it was originally
designed for geometry matching within cross views of a single instance,
misaligned with cross-instance semantic matching, and further hindered by the
scarcity of dense semantic annotations. To address this, we propose an approach
that (i) retains VGGT's intrinsic strengths by reusing early feature stages,
fine-tuning later ones, and adding a semantic head for bidirectional
correspondences; and (ii) adapts VGGT to the semantic matching scenario under
data scarcity through cycle-consistent training strategy, synthetic data
augmentation, and progressive training recipe with aliasing artifact
mitigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior geometry awareness, matching reliability, and manifold preservation,
outperforming previous baselines.

### [81] [MedVSR: Medical Video Super-Resolution with Cross State-Space Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21265)
*Xinyu Liu,Guolei Sun,Cheng Wang,Yixuan Yuan,Ender Konukoglu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MedVSR框架，专门针对医学视频超分辨率任务，解决现有VSR模型在医学视频中面临的运动模糊、噪声和帧对齐困难等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率医学视频对准确诊断至关重要，但硬件限制和生理约束使得获取困难。现有VSR模型在处理医学视频时存在对齐误差、产生伪影和特征失真等问题，可能误导医生诊断。

Method: 提出Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP)模块，通过状态空间模型将远距离帧投影为控制矩阵，选择性传播一致特征以实现有效对齐；设计Inner State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR)模块，结合长程空间特征学习和大核短程信息聚合来增强组织结构并减少伪影。

Result: 在四个医学数据集（包括内窥镜和白内障手术）上的实验表明，MedVSR在重建性能和处理效率上显著优于现有VSR模型。

Conclusion: MedVSR是针对医学视频超分辨率任务的定制化解决方案，能够有效处理医学视频特有的挑战，为临床诊断提供更可靠的超分辨率结果。

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) medical videos are vital for accurate diagnosis, yet are
hard to acquire due to hardware limitations and physiological constraints.
Clinically, the collected low-resolution (LR) medical videos present unique
challenges for video super-resolution (VSR) models, including camera shake,
noise, and abrupt frame transitions, which result in significant optical flow
errors and alignment difficulties. Additionally, tissues and organs exhibit
continuous and nuanced structures, but current VSR models are prone to
introducing artifacts and distorted features that can mislead doctors. To this
end, we propose MedVSR, a tailored framework for medical VSR. It first employs
Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) to address the imprecise alignment by
projecting distant frames as control matrices within state-space models,
enabling the selective propagation of consistent and informative features to
neighboring frames for effective alignment. Moreover, we design an Inner
State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) module that enhances tissue structures and
reduces artifacts with joint long-range spatial feature learning and
large-kernel short-range information aggregation. Experiments across four
datasets in diverse medical scenarios, including endoscopy and cataract
surgeries, show that MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in
reconstruction performance and efficiency. Code released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS)方法来解决强化学习微调中的梯度消失问题，并发布了大规模高质量的长链思维数据集和训练代码库，开源了多尺度多模态推理模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态推理模型面临两个主要限制：缺乏开放、大规模、高质量的长链思维数据，以及强化学习后训练的不稳定性。GRPO框架在奖励方差低时容易出现梯度消失问题。

Method: 提出了Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS)数据选择策略，通过Variance Promotion Score (VPS)结合结果方差和轨迹多样性来促进奖励方差并稳定策略优化。同时发布了约160万条长链思维数据和15k RL问答对。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中验证了所提出方法和数据资源的有效性。理论分析表明奖励方差下界了期望策略梯度的大小，VAS是实现这一保证的实用机制。

Conclusion: 该工作通过VAS方法有效解决了RL微调中的梯度消失问题，提供的大规模高质量数据集和开源模型为社区建立了标准化基准，推动了多模态推理模型的发展。

Abstract: Large multimodal reasoning models have achieved rapid progress, but their
advancement is constrained by two major limitations: the absence of open,
large-scale, high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT) data, and the instability
of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in post-training. Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), the standard framework for RL fine-tuning, is prone
to gradient vanishing when reward variance is low, which weakens optimization
signals and impairs convergence. This work makes three contributions: (1) We
propose Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS), a data selection strategy guided by
Variance Promotion Score (VPS) that combines outcome variance and trajectory
diversity to promote reward variance and stabilize policy optimization. (2) We
release large-scale, carefully curated resources containing ~1.6M long CoT
cold-start data and ~15k RL QA pairs, designed to ensure quality, difficulty,
and diversity, along with a fully reproducible end-to-end training codebase.
(3) We open-source a family of multimodal reasoning models in multiple scales,
establishing standardized baselines for the community. Experiments across
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both the
curated data and the proposed VAS. Comprehensive ablation studies and analyses
provide further insight into the contributions of each component. In addition,
we theoretically establish that reward variance lower-bounds the expected
policy gradient magnitude, with VAS serving as a practical mechanism to realize
this guarantee. Our code, data, and checkpoints are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个基于Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer架构的海洋科学基础模型，通过自监督预训练在Sentinel-3 OLCI数据上，并在两个下游海洋遥感任务中验证其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海洋科学中标记数据稀缺且昂贵，而AI基础模型在大量无标签数据上预训练后，能够显著改善海洋监测应用。

Method: 使用Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer架构，在Sentinel-3 OLCI数据上进行自监督预训练，然后微调应用于叶绿素浓度量化和海洋初级生产力估计两个下游任务。

Result: 模型在利用少量高质量标记数据和捕捉详细海洋颜色空间模式方面表现出色，同时能够匹配点观测数据，证明了自训练基础模型在海洋监测中的实用性。

Conclusion: 新一代地理空间AI模型有潜力为海洋生态系统及其在全球气候过程中的作用提供更稳健、数据驱动的见解。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Foundation models (FMs), pre-trained on massive
unlabelled datasets, have the potential to drastically change AI applications
in ocean science, where labelled data are often sparse and expensive to
collect. In this work, we describe a new foundation model using the Prithvi-EO
Vision Transformer architecture which has been pre-trained to reconstruct data
from the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). We evaluate the
model by fine-tuning on two downstream marine earth observation tasks. We first
assess model performance compared to current baseline models used to quantify
chlorophyll concentration. We then evaluate the FMs ability to refine remote
sensing-based estimates of ocean primary production. Our results demonstrate
the utility of self-trained FMs for marine monitoring, in particular for making
use of small amounts of high quality labelled data and in capturing detailed
spatial patterns of ocean colour whilst matching point observations. We
conclude that this new generation of geospatial AI models has the potential to
provide more robust, data-driven insights into ocean ecosystems and their role
in global climate processes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SHINE是一个无需训练的框架，用于实现无缝、高保真度的图像合成，通过引入流形引导锚点损失、退化抑制引导和自适应背景融合技术，解决现有模型在复杂光照和高分辨率输入下的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像合成模型在处理复杂光照（如准确阴影、水面反射）和多样化高分辨率输入时表现不佳，而现代文本到图像扩散模型虽然编码了物理和分辨率先验，但缺乏有效框架来释放这些能力。

Method: SHINE提出流形引导锚点损失，利用预训练定制适配器指导潜在表示以保持主体忠实性；采用退化抑制引导消除低质量输出；使用自适应背景融合消除可见接缝。

Result: 在ComplexCompo和DreamEditBench上的实验显示，SHINE在标准指标（如DINOv2）和人类对齐评分（如DreamSim、ImageReward、VisionReward）上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SHINE框架有效解决了复杂光照条件下的图像合成问题，无需训练即可实现高质量结果，并引入了新的基准测试集ComplexCompo。

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert a user-specified object into a
new scene, but existing models struggle with complex lighting (e.g., accurate
shadows, water reflections) and diverse, high-resolution inputs. Modern
text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX) already encode essential
physical and resolution priors, yet lack a framework to unleash them without
resorting to latent inversion, which often locks object poses into contextually
inappropriate orientations, or brittle attention surgery. We propose SHINE, a
training-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized
Errors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained
customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject
representation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression
guidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate
low-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous
benchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and
challenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate
shadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and
DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g.,
DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward).
Code and benchmark will be publicly available upon publication.

TL;DR: QuantVGGT是首个针对VGGT的量化框架，通过双平滑细粒度量化和噪声过滤多样化采样技术，解决了十亿级VGGT量化中的重尾分布和校准样本选择不稳定问题，在4位量化下实现3.7倍内存减少和2.5倍加速，同时保持98%以上的重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于学习的3D重建模型（如VGGT）虽然取得了显著进展，但其巨大的计算和内存成本严重阻碍了实际部署。后训练量化（PTQ）在压缩十亿级VGGT时面临独特挑战：数据无关的特殊令牌导致重尾激活分布，而3D数据的多视图特性使校准样本选择高度不稳定。

Method: QuantVGGT主要依赖两项技术贡献：1）双平滑细粒度量化，集成预全局Hadamard旋转和后局部通道平滑来缓解重尾分布和通道间方差；2）噪声过滤多样化采样，通过深层统计过滤异常值，构建帧感知多样化校准簇以确保稳定的量化范围。

Result: 综合实验表明，QuantVGGT在不同基准和位宽下均达到最先进结果，显著超越之前的通用量化方法。4位QuantVGGT可实现3.7倍内存减少和2.5倍硬件推理加速，同时保持重建精度在完整精度模型的98%以上。

Conclusion: QuantVGGT在资源受限场景下具有巨大优势和实用性，为VGGT的高效部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Learning-based 3D reconstruction models, represented by Visual Geometry
Grounded Transformers (VGGTs), have made remarkable progress with the use of
large-scale transformers. Their prohibitive computational and memory costs
severely hinder real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has
become a common practice for compressing and accelerating models. However, we
empirically observe that PTQ faces unique obstacles when compressing
billion-scale VGGTs: the data-independent special tokens induce heavy-tailed
activation distributions, while the multi-view nature of 3D data makes
calibration sample selection highly unstable. This paper proposes the first
Quantization framework for VGGTs, namely QuantVGGT. This mainly relies on two
technical contributions: First, we introduce Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained
Quantization, which integrates pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local
channel smoothing to mitigate heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel
variance robustly. Second, we design Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling, which
filters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse
calibration clusters to ensure stable quantization ranges. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that QuantVGGT achieves the state-of-the-art results
across different benchmarks and bit-width, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art generic quantization method with a great margin. We highlight
that our 4-bit QuantVGGT can deliver a 3.7$\times$ memory reduction and
2.5$\times$ acceleration in real-hardware inference, while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy above 98\% of its full-precision counterpart. This
demonstrates the vast advantages and practicality of QuantVGGT in
resource-constrained scenarios. Our code is released in

TL;DR: 牛顿生成（NewtonGen）是一个结合数据驱动合成与可学习物理原理的框架，通过可训练的神经牛顿动力学（NND）来建模和预测牛顿运动，从而在视频生成过程中注入潜在动力学约束，实现物理一致且参数可控的视频合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大规模文本到视频生成的主要瓶颈是物理一致性和可控性。现有模型往往产生不真实的运动（如物体向上坠落、速度和方向的突变），且缺乏精确的参数控制，难以在不同初始条件下生成物理一致的动态效果。

Method: 提出牛顿生成框架，核心是可训练的神经牛顿动力学（NND），能够建模和预测多种牛顿运动，将潜在动力学约束注入视频生成过程。通过联合利用数据先验和动力学指导，实现物理一致的视频合成。

Result: 牛顿生成框架能够生成物理一致且参数可控的视频，解决了现有模型在物理动态建模方面的局限性。

Conclusion: 通过集成数据驱动合成与可学习物理原理，牛顿生成为文本到视频生成提供了物理一致性和精确控制的新途径，克服了当前模型仅从外观学习运动分布的局限性。

Abstract: A primary bottleneck in large-scale text-to-video generation today is
physical consistency and controllability. Despite recent advances,
state-of-the-art models often produce unrealistic motions, such as objects
falling upward, or abrupt changes in velocity and direction. Moreover, these
models lack precise parameter control, struggling to generate physically
consistent dynamics under different initial conditions. We argue that this
fundamental limitation stems from current models learning motion distributions
solely from appearance, while lacking an understanding of the underlying
dynamics. In this work, we propose NewtonGen, a framework that integrates
data-driven synthesis with learnable physical principles. At its core lies
trainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND), which can model and predict a
variety of Newtonian motions, thereby injecting latent dynamical constraints
into the video generation process. By jointly leveraging data priors and
dynamical guidance, NewtonGen enables physically consistent video synthesis
with precise parameter control.

Abstract: We present SD3.5-Flash, an efficient few-step distillation framework that
brings high-quality image generation to accessible consumer devices. Our
approach distills computationally prohibitive rectified flow models through a
reformulated distribution matching objective tailored specifically for few-step
generation. We introduce two key innovations: "timestep sharing" to reduce
gradient noise and "split-timestep fine-tuning" to improve prompt alignment.
Combined with comprehensive pipeline optimizations like text encoder
restructuring and specialized quantization, our system enables both rapid
generation and memory-efficient deployment across different hardware
configurations. This democratizes access across the full spectrum of devices,
from mobile phones to desktop computers. Through extensive evaluation including
large-scale user studies, we demonstrate that SD3.5-Flash consistently
outperforms existing few-step methods, making advanced generative AI truly
accessible for practical deployment.

Abstract: Medical Imaging (MI) datasets are fundamental to artificial intelligence in
healthcare. The accuracy, robustness, and fairness of diagnostic algorithms
depend on the data (and its quality) used to train and evaluate the models. MI
datasets used to be proprietary, but have become increasingly available to the
public, including on community-contributed platforms (CCPs) like Kaggle or
HuggingFace. While open data is important to enhance the redistribution of
data's public value, we find that the current CCP governance model fails to
uphold the quality needed and recommended practices for sharing, documenting,
and evaluating datasets. In this paper, we conduct an analysis of publicly
available machine learning datasets on CCPs, discussing datasets' context, and
identifying limitations and gaps in the current CCP landscape. We highlight
differences between MI and computer vision datasets, particularly in the
potentially harmful downstream effects from poor adoption of recommended
dataset management practices. We compare the analyzed datasets across several
dimensions, including data sharing, data documentation, and maintenance. We
find vague licenses, lack of persistent identifiers and storage, duplicates,
and missing metadata, with differences between the platforms. Our research
contributes to efforts in responsible data curation and AI algorithms for
healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公众情绪在外交中至关重要，但传统调查方法耗时耗力且缺乏前瞻性分析能力，需要更高效的数据驱动工具来指导外交沟通策略。

Method: 首先构建外交事件描述和公众讨论数据集训练预测模型；然后基于传播理论确定可修改的文本特征；最后开发使用大语言模型的反事实生成算法系统性地产生修改版本。

Result: 该框架成功将公众情绪转向更有利状态的成功率达到70%，证明其有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架可作为外交官、政策制定者和传播专家的实用工具，提供数据驱动的见解来塑造更理想的公众情绪。

Abstract: Diplomatic events consistently prompt widespread public discussion and
debate. Public sentiment plays a critical role in diplomacy, as a good
sentiment provides vital support for policy implementation, helps resolve
international issues, and shapes a nation's international image. Traditional
methods for gauging public sentiment, such as large-scale surveys or manual
content analysis of media, are typically time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
lack the capacity for forward-looking analysis. We propose a novel framework
that identifies specific modifications for diplomatic event narratives to shift
public sentiment from negative to neutral or positive. First, we train a
language model to predict public reaction towards diplomatic events. To this
end, we construct a dataset comprising descriptions of diplomatic events and
their associated public discussions. Second, guided by communication theories
and in collaboration with domain experts, we predetermined several textual
features for modification, ensuring that any alterations changed the event's
narrative framing while preserving its core facts.We develop a counterfactual
generation algorithm that employs a large language model to systematically
produce modified versions of an original text. The results show that this
framework successfully shifted public sentiment to a more favorable state with
a 70\% success rate. This framework can therefore serve as a practical tool for
diplomats, policymakers, and communication specialists, offering data-driven
insights on how to frame diplomatic initiatives or report on events to foster a
more desirable public sentiment.

Motivation: 跨语言语音情感识别面临不同语言的语音变异性和说话人表达风格差异的挑战，需要能够对齐不同说话人和语言间情感外化的框架。

Method: 通过基于图的聚类构建情感特定的说话人社区来捕捉共享的说话人特征，然后在说话人和音素空间应用双空间锚定技术。

Conclusion: 该方法为跨语言情感表征的共同性提供了有价值的见解，证明了双空间锚定框架在跨语言情感识别中的有效性。

Abstract: Cross-lingual speech emotion recognition (SER) remains a challenging task due
to differences in phonetic variability and speaker-specific expressive styles
across languages. Effectively capturing emotion under such diverse conditions
requires a framework that can align the externalization of emotions across
different speakers and languages. To address this problem, we propose a
speaker-style aware phoneme anchoring framework that aligns emotional
expression at the phonetic and speaker levels. Our method builds
emotion-specific speaker communities via graph-based clustering to capture
shared speaker traits. Using these groups, we apply dual-space anchoring in
speaker and phonetic spaces to enable better emotion transfer across languages.
Evaluations on the MSP-Podcast (English) and BIIC-Podcast (Taiwanese Mandarin)
corpora demonstrate improved generalization over competitive baselines and
provide valuable insights into the commonalities in cross-lingual emotion
representation.

performance across three key competencies: graduate-level CFD knowledge,
numerical and physical reasoning of CFD, and context-dependent implementation
of CFD workflows. Grounded in real-world CFD practices, our benchmark combines
a detailed task taxonomy with a rigorous evaluation framework to deliver
reproducible results and quantify LLM performance across code executability,

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的单一表示方法优于模型多样性，本研究为开发更强大的检测框架奠定了基础，需要更大更丰富的数据集来跟上不断改进的生成式AI模型。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has
blurred the line between human and AI-generated texts, raising urgent questions
about academic integrity, intellectual property, and the spread of
misinformation. Thus, reliable AI-text detection is needed for fair assessment
to safeguard human authenticity and cultivate trust in digital communication.
In this study, we investigate how well current machine learning (ML) approaches
can distinguish ChatGPT-3.5-generated texts from human-written texts employing
a labeled data set of 250 pairs of abstracts from a wide range of research
topics. We test and compare both classical (Logistic Regression armed with
classical Bag-of-Words, POS, and TF-IDF features) and transformer-based (BERT
augmented with N-grams, DistilBERT, BERT with a lightweight custom classifier,
and LSTM-based N-gram models) ML detection techniques. As we aim to assess each
model's performance in detecting AI-generated research texts, we also aim to
test whether an ensemble of these models can outperform any single detector.
Results show DistilBERT achieves the overall best performance, while Logistic
Regression and BERT-Custom offer solid, balanced alternatives; LSTM- and
BERT-N-gram approaches lag. The max voting ensemble of the three best models
fails to surpass DistilBERT itself, highlighting the primacy of a single
transformer-based representation over mere model diversity. By comprehensively
assessing the strengths and weaknesses of these AI-text detection approaches,
this work lays a foundation for more robust transformer frameworks with larger,
richer datasets to keep pace with ever-improving generative AI models.

TL;DR: ConceptViz是一个用于探索大语言模型中概念的可视化分析系统，通过识别-解释-验证的流程帮助研究人员理解SAE特征与人类概念之间的对应关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然稀疏自编码器是提取LLM可解释特征的有前景技术，但SAE特征并不天然与人类可理解的概念对齐，导致解释过程繁琐且劳动密集。需要弥合SAE特征与人类概念之间的差距。

Method: ConceptViz实现了新颖的识别=>解释=>验证流程，使用户能够使用感兴趣的概念查询SAE，交互式探索概念到特征的对齐，并通过模型行为验证对应关系。

Result: 通过两个使用场景和用户研究证明了ConceptViz的有效性，结果显示该系统通过简化LLM中有意义概念表示的发现和验证过程，增强了可解释性研究。

Conclusion: ConceptViz有助于研究人员建立更准确的LLM特征心智模型，其代码和用户指南已公开可用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a
wide range of natural language tasks. Understanding how LLMs internally
represent knowledge remains a significant challenge. Despite Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising technique for extracting
interpretable features from LLMs, SAE features do not inherently align with
human-understandable concepts, making their interpretation cumbersome and
labor-intensive. To bridge the gap between SAE features and human concepts, we
present ConceptViz, a visual analytics system designed for exploring concepts
in LLMs. ConceptViz implements a novel dentification => Interpretation =>
Validation pipeline, enabling users to query SAEs using concepts of interest,
interactively explore concept-to-feature alignments, and validate the
correspondences through model behavior verification. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of ConceptViz through two usage scenarios and a user study. Our
results show that ConceptViz enhances interpretability research by streamlining
the discovery and validation of meaningful concept representations in LLMs,
ultimately aiding researchers in building more accurate mental models of LLM
features. Our code and user guide are publicly available at

*Tomoaki Isoda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SKILL-RAG是一种利用模型自我知识来过滤检索内容的新方法，通过强化学习框架在句子级别过滤无关内容，提高RAG性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于检索系统可能返回无关内容，导致模型产生幻觉，需要理解模型的自我知识（知道什么和不知道什么）来更好地整合内部和外部知识

Method: 提出SKILL-RAG方法，基于强化学习训练框架显式提取模型的自我知识，采用句子级粒度过滤无关内容，保留有用知识

Result: 在多个问答基准测试中，SKILL-RAG不仅提高了生成质量，还显著减少了输入文档数量

Conclusion: 实验结果验证了自我知识在指导高质量检索选择中的重要性

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly improved the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks in
recent years. However, since retrieval systems may return irrelevant content,
incorporating such information into the model often leads to hallucinations.
Thus, identifying and filtering out unhelpful retrieved content is a key
challenge for improving RAG performance.To better integrate the internal
knowledge of the model with external knowledge from retrieval, it is essential
to understand what the model "knows" and "does not know" (which is also called
"self-knowledge"). Based on this insight, we propose SKILL-RAG (Self-Knowledge
Induced Learning and Filtering for RAG), a novel method that leverages the
model's self-knowledge to determine which retrieved documents are beneficial
for answering a given query. We design a reinforcement learning-based training
framework to explicitly elicit self-knowledge from the model and employs
sentence-level granularity to filter out irrelevant content while preserving
useful knowledge.We evaluate SKILL-RAG using Llama2-7B and Qwen3-8B on several
question answering benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that SKILL-RAG
not only improves generation quality but also significantly reduces the number
of input documents, validating the importance of self-knowledge in guiding the
selection of high-quality retrievals.

*Sirui Wang,Andong Chen,Tiejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Emo-FiLM是一个细粒度情感建模框架，用于基于LLM的文本转语音系统，通过词级情感控制解决现有方法无法捕捉句子内动态情感变化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感文本转语音系统依赖句子级控制（预定义标签、参考音频或自然语言提示），虽然对全局情感表达有效，但无法捕捉句子内的动态情感变化。

Method: Emo-FiLM将emotion2vec的帧级特征与词语对齐获得词级情感标注，通过FiLM层映射，直接调制文本嵌入实现词级情感控制。构建了细粒度情感动态数据集FEDD进行评估。

Result: 实验表明Emo-FiLM在全局和细粒度任务上均优于现有方法，证明了其在表达性语音合成中的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: Emo-FiLM框架成功解决了情感文本转语音中的细粒度情感控制问题，为创建更自然可信的人机交互提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Emotional text-to-speech (E-TTS) is central to creating natural and
trustworthy human-computer interaction. Existing systems typically rely on
sentence-level control through predefined labels, reference audio, or natural
language prompts. While effective for global emotion expression, these
approaches fail to capture dynamic shifts within a sentence. To address this
limitation, we introduce Emo-FiLM, a fine-grained emotion modeling framework
for LLM-based TTS. Emo-FiLM aligns frame-level features from emotion2vec to
words to obtain word-level emotion annotations, and maps them through a
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer, enabling word-level emotion
control by directly modulating text embeddings. To support evaluation, we
construct the Fine-grained Emotion Dynamics Dataset (FEDD) with detailed
annotations of emotional transitions. Experiments show that Emo-FiLM
outperforms existing approaches on both global and fine-grained tasks,
demonstrating its effectiveness and generality for expressive speech synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的对话推荐方法主要利用LLM的总结和分析能力，但忽视了训练问题。作者希望从模型层面提升LLM在对话推荐中的性能。

Method: 1. 设计基于LLM的偏好优化数据集构建策略用于强化学习训练；2. 在推理阶段提出自增强策略进一步挖掘训练获得的对话推荐潜力。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法持续优于之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: USB-Rec框架通过整合训练和推理阶段，有效提升了LLM在对话推荐任务中的表现。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely employed in
Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). Unlike traditional language model
approaches that focus on training, all existing LLMs-based approaches are
mainly centered around how to leverage the summarization and analysis
capabilities of LLMs while ignoring the issue of training. Therefore, in this
work, we propose an integrated training-inference framework,
User-Simulator-Based framework (USB-Rec), for improving the performance of LLMs
in conversational recommendation at the model level. Firstly, we design a
LLM-based Preference Optimization (PO) dataset construction strategy for RL
training, which helps the LLMs understand the strategies and methods in
conversational recommendation. Secondly, we propose a Self-Enhancement Strategy
(SES) at the inference stage to further exploit the conversational
recommendation potential obtained from RL training. Extensive experiments on
various datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods.

Method: 基于保形预测校准句子级重要性分数的阈值，实现具有用户指定覆盖率和召回率的抽取式文档摘要，方法模型无关且只需小规模校准集

Result: 在标准摘要基准测试中，该方法达到了理论保证的信息覆盖率

Conclusion: 该框架可与现有技术结合实现可靠可控的自动摘要，为AI摘要工具在关键应用中的安全部署铺平道路

Abstract: Automatic summarization systems have advanced rapidly with large language
models (LLMs), yet they still lack reliable guarantees on inclusion of critical
content in high-stakes domains like healthcare, law, and finance. In this work,
we introduce Conformal Importance Summarization, the first framework for
importance-preserving summary generation which uses conformal prediction to
provide rigorous, distribution-free coverage guarantees. By calibrating
thresholds on sentence-level importance scores, we enable extractive document
summarization with user-specified coverage and recall rates over critical
content. Our method is model-agnostic, requires only a small calibration set,
and seamlessly integrates with existing black-box LLMs. Experiments on
established summarization benchmarks demonstrate that Conformal Importance
Summarization achieves the theoretically assured information coverage rate. Our
work suggests that Conformal Importance Summarization can be combined with
existing techniques to achieve reliable, controllable automatic summarization,
paving the way for safer deployment of AI summarization tools in critical
applications. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MARS是一个基于角色的多智能体协作框架，通过模拟审稿流程来提升大语言模型的推理能力，在保持与多智能体辩论相同准确率的同时，将token使用量和推理时间减少约50%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体辩论虽然能提升大语言模型的推理能力，但存在计算开销大的问题，需要大量智能体参与和频繁通信。

Method: MARS采用审稿流程设计：作者智能体生成初始解决方案，审稿人智能体独立提供决策和评论，元审稿人整合反馈做出最终决策并指导进一步修订。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MARS与多智能体辩论的准确率相当，但token使用量和推理时间减少了约50%。

Conclusion: MARS通过避免审稿人之间的交互，在保证推理质量的同时有效控制了计算成本，为大语言模型的协作推理提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in natural
language understanding, yet their reasoning capabilities remain limited when
operating as single agents. Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has been proposed to
address this limitation by enabling collaborative reasoning among multiple
models in a round-table debate manner. While effective, MAD introduces
substantial computational overhead due to the number of agents involved and the
frequent communication required. In this paper, we propose MARS (Multi-Agent
Review System), a role-based collaboration framework inspired by the review
process. In MARS, an author agent generates an initial solution, reviewer
agents provide decisions and comments independently, and a meta-reviewer
integrates the feedback to make the final decision and guide further revision.
This design enhances reasoning quality while avoiding costly
reviewer-to-reviewer interactions, thereby controlling token consumption and
inference time. We compared MARS with both MAD and other state-of-the-art
reasoning strategies across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments with
different LLMs show that MARS matches the accuracy of MAD while reducing both
token usage and inference time by approximately 50\%. Code is available at

Motivation: 尽管机器翻译近年来取得重大进展，但许多低资源语言（如粤语和吴语）由于缺乏大规模训练数据和语言资源，进展仍然有限。这些语言虽然各有超过8000万使用者，但机器翻译质量不高。

Method: 基于现有平行语料库构建SiniticMTError数据集，通过母语者的严格标注流程，提供错误跨度、错误类型和错误严重程度的标注，分析标注者间一致性和错误模式。

Result: 创建了一个包含英语到普通话、粤语和吴语机器翻译错误标注的数据集，支持翻译质量估计、错误感知生成和低资源语言评估等研究。

Conclusion: SiniticMTError数据集为机器翻译社区提供了有价值的资源，可用于微调具有错误检测能力的模型，推动低资源语言机器翻译的发展。

Abstract: Despite major advances in machine translation (MT) in recent years, progress
remains limited for many low-resource languages that lack large-scale training
data and linguistic resources. Cantonese and Wu Chinese are two Sinitic
examples, although each enjoys more than 80 million speakers around the world.
In this paper, we introduce SiniticMTError, a novel dataset that builds on
existing parallel corpora to provide error span, error type, and error severity
annotations in machine-translated examples from English to Mandarin, Cantonese,
and Wu Chinese. Our dataset serves as a resource for the MT community to
utilize in fine-tuning models with error detection capabilities, supporting
research on translation quality estimation, error-aware generation, and
low-resource language evaluation. We report our rigorous annotation process by
native speakers, with analyses on inter-annotator agreement, iterative
feedback, and patterns in error type and severity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言医疗环境中临床文本自动诊断的挑战，特别是低资源语言标注数据稀缺和跨语言语言变异性的问题。

Method: 基于XLM-RoBERTa编码器，结合语言感知注意力机制、孪生对比学习模块、翻译一致性模块和对比投影头，采用多任务学习和MAML元学习策略进行训练。

Result: 在监督设置下达到97.22%准确率和97.17% F1分数；零样本场景下印地语准确率92.78%，孟加拉语准确率73.33%。

Conclusion: SwasthLLM在多语言医疗诊断中表现出色，特别是在低资源语言环境下具有强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: In multilingual healthcare environments, automatic disease diagnosis from
clinical text remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of annotated
medical data in low-resource languages and the linguistic variability across
populations. This paper proposes SwasthLLM, a unified, zero-shot,
cross-lingual, and multi-task learning framework for medical diagnosis that
operates effectively across English, Hindi, and Bengali without requiring
language-specific fine-tuning. At its core, SwasthLLM leverages the
multilingual XLM-RoBERTa encoder augmented with a language-aware attention
mechanism and a disease classification head, enabling the model to extract
medically relevant information regardless of the language structure. To align
semantic representations across languages, a Siamese contrastive learning
module is introduced, ensuring that equivalent medical texts in different
languages produce similar embeddings. Further, a translation consistency module
and a contrastive projection head reinforce language-invariant representation
learning. SwasthLLM is trained using a multi-task learning strategy, jointly
optimizing disease classification, translation alignment, and contrastive
learning objectives. Additionally, we employ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning
(MAML) to equip the model with rapid adaptation capabilities for unseen
languages or tasks with minimal data. Our phased training pipeline emphasizes
robust representation alignment before task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive
evaluation shows that SwasthLLM achieves high diagnostic performance, with a
test accuracy of 97.22% and an F1-score of 97.17% in supervised settings.
Crucially, in zero-shot scenarios, it attains 92.78% accuracy on Hindi and
73.33% accuracy on Bengali medical text, demonstrating strong generalization in
low-resource contexts.

TL;DR: DS-MoE是一种动态推理链架构，通过深度专业化专家混合模型，为不同复杂度的输入动态选择推理深度，实现计算效率和质量的双重提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer对所有输入应用相同处理深度，导致简单查询浪费资源，复杂问题推理不足。需要一种能根据输入复杂度自适应调整推理深度的架构

Method: 提出DS-MoE框架，包含不同推理深度的专家模块（浅层模式识别、组合推理、逻辑推理等），通过学习的路由网络动态组装定制推理链

Result: 在The Pile数据集上实验显示：计算节省达16%，推理速度提升35%，复杂多步推理准确率提高2.8%，同时提供可解释的推理链

Conclusion: DS-MoE在自适应神经网络架构方面取得重要进展，证明深度专业化模块化处理能同时提升大规模语言模型的效率、推理质量和可解释性

Abstract: Contemporary transformer architectures apply identical processing depth to
all inputs, creating inefficiencies and limiting reasoning quality. Simple
factual queries are subjected to the same multilayered computation as complex
logical problems, wasting resources while constraining deep inference. To
overcome this, we came up with a concept of Dynamic Reasoning Chains through
Depth Specialised Mixture of Experts (DS-MoE), a modular framework that extends
the Mixture of Experts paradigm from width-based to depth specialised
computation. DS-MoE introduces expert modules optimised for distinct reasoning
depths, shallow pattern recognition, compositional reasoning, logical
inference, memory integration, and meta-cognitive supervision. A learned
routing network dynamically assembles custom reasoning chains, activating only
the necessary experts to match input complexity. The dataset on which we
trained and evaluated DS-MoE is on The Pile, an 800GB corpus covering diverse
domains such as scientific papers, legal texts, programming code, and web
content, enabling systematic assessment across reasoning depths. Experimental
results demonstrate that DS-MoE achieves up to 16 per cent computational
savings and 35 per cent faster inference compared to uniform-depth
transformers, while delivering 2.8 per cent higher accuracy on complex
multi-step reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, routing decisions yield
interpretable reasoning chains, enhancing transparency and scalability. These
findings establish DS-MoE as a significant advancement in adaptive neural
architectures, demonstrating that depth-specialised modular processing can
simultaneously improve efficiency, reasoning quality, and interpretability in
large-scale language models.

TL;DR: 提出了HRT（分层分辨率Transformer），一种受小波启发的神经架构，通过多分辨率处理语言，解决了标准Transformer将文本视为扁平序列的问题，实现了O(nlogn)复杂度和性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer架构将文本处理为扁平标记序列，忽视了语言的层次结构，导致二次计算成本、弱组合泛化能力和不足的语篇级建模。

Method: HRT采用小波启发的多分辨率注意力机制，从字符到语篇级单元同时处理语言，通过指数序列缩减实现O(nlogn)复杂度，支持自下而上的组合和自上而下的语境化。

Result: 在GLUE、SuperGLUE、Long Range Arena和WikiText-103等基准测试中，HRT平均比标准Transformer基线提升3.8%-6.1%，内存使用减少42%，推理延迟降低37%。

Conclusion: HRT是首个将计算结构与人类语言层次组织对齐的架构，证明了多尺度小波启发处理既能获得理论效率增益，又能实际提升语言理解能力。

Abstract: Transformer architectures have achieved state-of-the-art performance across
natural language tasks, yet they fundamentally misrepresent the hierarchical
nature of human language by processing text as flat token sequences. This
results in quadratic computational cost, weak computational cost, weak
compositional generalization, and inadequate discourse-level modeling. We
propose Hierarchical Resolution Transformer (HRT), a novel wavelet-inspired
neural architecture that processes language simultaneously across multiple
resolutions, from characters to discourse-level units. HRT constructs a
multi-resolution attention, enabling bottom-up composition and top-down
contextualization. By employing exponential sequence reduction across scales,
HRT achieves O(nlogn) complexity, offering significant efficiency improvements
over standard transformers. We evaluated HRT on a diverse suite of benchmarks,
including GLUE, SuperGLUE, Long Range Arena, and WikiText-103, and results
demonstrated that HRT outperforms standard transformer baselines by an average
of +3.8% on GLUE, +4.5% on SuperGLUE, and +6.1% on Long Range Arena, while
reducing memory usage by 42% and inference latency by 37% compared to BERT and
GPT style models of similar parameter count. Ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of cross-resolution attention and scale-specialized modules,
showing that each contributes independently to both efficiency and accuracy.
Our findings establish HRT as the first architecture to align computational
structure with the hierarchical organization of human language, demonstrating
that multi-scale, wavelet-inspired processing yields both theoretical
efficiency gains and practical improvements in language understanding.

TL;DR: FS-DFM是一种少步离散流匹配方法，通过将采样步数作为显式参数训练模型，在保持生成质量的同时实现128倍加速采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型生成速度慢，扩散语言模型需要数百到数千次迭代才能达到高质量，限制了实际应用中的吞吐量和延迟表现。

Method: 提出离散流匹配模型，使模型在不同步数预算下保持一致性，配合可靠的更新规则和从长轨迹中蒸馏的强教师指导。

Result: 在语言建模基准测试中，FS-DFM仅用8个采样步就达到了与1024步离散流基线相当的困惑度，采样速度提升128倍。

Conclusion: FS-DFM通过少步采样实现了高质量语言生成，显著提升了采样效率和实用性。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models (ARMs) deliver strong likelihoods, but are
inherently serial: they generate one token per forward pass, which limits
throughput and inflates latency for long sequences. Diffusion Language Models
(DLMs) parallelize across positions and thus appear promising for language
generation, yet standard discrete diffusion typically needs hundreds to
thousands of model evaluations to reach high quality, trading serial depth for
iterative breadth. We introduce FS-DFM, Few-Step Discrete Flow-Matching. A
discrete flow-matching model designed for speed without sacrificing quality.
The core idea is simple: make the number of sampling steps an explicit
parameter and train the model to be consistent across step budgets, so one big
move lands where many small moves would. We pair this with a reliable update
rule that moves probability in the right direction without overshooting, and
with strong teacher guidance distilled from long-run trajectories. Together,
these choices make few-step sampling stable, accurate, and easy to control. On
language modeling benchmarks, FS-DFM with 8 sampling steps achieves perplexity
parity with a 1,024-step discrete-flow baseline for generating 1,024 tokens
using a similar-size model, delivering up to 128 times faster sampling and
corresponding latency/throughput gains.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型评估瓶颈问题，希望在运行实验前就能预测模型性能，从而更高效地进行模型迭代和实验优先级排序。

Method: 使用检索模块从任务描述中提取信息来预测模型性能，在PRECOG数据集上进行测试，包括零泄漏设置下的预测。

Result: 该方法达到平均绝对误差8.7（准确率子集），强推理模型能进行多样化迭代查询，而开源模型表现较差。GPT-5在零泄漏设置下仍能获得显著预测准确率。

Conclusion: 该研究为开放式预期评估提供了初步步骤，支持难度估计和更智能的实验优先级排序。

Abstract: Progress in large language models is constrained by an evaluation bottleneck:
build a benchmark, evaluate models and settings, then iterate. We therefore ask
a simple question: can we forecast outcomes before running any experiments? We
study text-only performance forecasting: estimating a model's score from a
redacted task description and intended configuration, with no access to dataset
instances. To support systematic study, we curate PRECOG, a corpus of redacted
description-performance pairs spanning diverse tasks, domains, and metrics.
Experiments show the task is challenging but feasible: models equipped with a
retrieval module that excludes source papers achieve moderate prediction
performance with well-calibrated uncertainty, reaching mean absolute error as
low as 8.7 on the Accuracy subset at high-confidence thresholds. Our analysis
indicates that stronger reasoning models engage in diverse, iterative querying,
whereas current open-source models lag and often skip retrieval or gather
evidence with limited diversity. We further test a zero-leakage setting,
forecasting on newly released datasets or experiments before their papers are
indexed, where GPT-5 with built-in web search still attains nontrivial
prediction accuracy. Overall, our corpus and analyses offer an initial step
toward open-ended anticipatory evaluation, supporting difficulty estimation and

### [106] [Building Tailored Speech Recognizers for Japanese Speaking Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20655)
*Yotaro Kubo,Richard Sproat,Chihiro Taguchi,Llion Jones*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种方法来解决日语语音识别中音素标注数据稀缺的问题，通过多任务学习和融合技术构建了专门用于日语口语评估的音素识别器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日语虽然是资源丰富的语言，但包含重音标记的准确音素转录训练数据很少，这限制了专门用于日语口语评估的语音识别器的开发。

Method: 提出了两种方法：1）多任务训练方案，引入辅助损失函数来估计输入信号的文本标签和音高模式；2）融合两个估计器（基于音素字母串和文本标记序列），使用有限状态转换器框架进行组合。

Result: 该方法将CSJ核心评估集的平均音节标签错误率从12.3%降低到7.1%，相比通用多语言识别器具有优势。

Conclusion: 多任务学习和融合技术对于构建准确的音素识别器是有效的，提出的方法在日语口语评估任务中表现优于通用识别器。

Abstract: This paper presents methods for building speech recognizers tailored for
Japanese speaking assessment tasks. Specifically, we build a speech recognizer
that outputs phonemic labels with accent markers. Although Japanese is
resource-rich, there is only a small amount of data for training models to
produce accurate phonemic transcriptions that include accent marks. We propose
two methods to mitigate data sparsity. First, a multitask training scheme
introduces auxiliary loss functions to estimate orthographic text labels and
pitch patterns of the input signal, so that utterances with only orthographic
annotations can be leveraged in training. The second fuses two estimators, one
over phonetic alphabet strings, and the other over text token sequences. To
combine these estimates we develop an algorithm based on the finite-state
transducer framework. Our results indicate that the use of multitask learning
and fusion is effective for building an accurate phonemic recognizer. We show
that this approach is advantageous compared to the use of generic multilingual
recognizers. The relative advantages of the proposed methods were also
compared. Our proposed methods reduced the average of mora-label error rates
from 12.3% to 7.1% over the CSJ core evaluation sets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的框架，首次将LLM提取的知识与预训练分子模型的结构特征相结合，以增强分子性质预测。该方法通过提示LLM生成领域相关知识和可执行代码来创建基于知识的特征，并与结构表示融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然图神经网络和自监督学习在分子性质预测方面取得了进展，但人类先验知识的整合仍然不可或缺。LLMs虽然强大，但在知识空白和幻觉方面存在限制，特别是对于研究较少的分子性质。

Method: 使用GPT-4o、GPT-4.1和DeepSeek-R1三种先进LLM进行知识提取，生成领域相关知识和分子向量化的可执行代码，将基于知识的特征与结构表示融合。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，这种集成方法优于现有方法，证实了LLM衍生知识与结构信息的结合为分子性质预测提供了稳健有效的解决方案。

Conclusion: LLM提取的知识与结构特征的集成是分子性质预测的有效方法，能够克服单一方法的局限性，提高预测性能。

Abstract: Predicting molecular properties is a critical component of drug discovery.
Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs),
have enabled end-to-end learning from molecular structures, reducing reliance
on manual feature engineering. However, while GNNs and self-supervised learning
approaches have advanced molecular property prediction (MPP), the integration
of human prior knowledge remains indispensable, as evidenced by recent methods
that leverage large language models (LLMs) for knowledge extraction. Despite
their strengths, LLMs are constrained by knowledge gaps and hallucinations,
particularly for less-studied molecular properties. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that, for the first time, integrates knowledge extracted from
LLMs with structural features derived from pre-trained molecular models to
enhance MPP. Our approach prompts LLMs to generate both domain-relevant
knowledge and executable code for molecular vectorization, producing
knowledge-based features that are subsequently fused with structural
representations. We employ three state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and
DeepSeek-R1, for knowledge extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our integrated method outperforms existing approaches, confirming that the
combination of LLM-derived knowledge and structural information provides a
robust and effective solution for MPP.

*Jonathan Rusert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为RedHerring的新型攻击方法，旨在使攻击检测模型不可靠，通过修改文本让检测模型误判为攻击，同时保持分类器正确预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然攻击检测模型已被证明能成功识别对抗性文本攻击，但其可靠性尚未得到充分探索。本文旨在测试这些检测模型在面对专门针对其设计的攻击时的可靠性。

Method: 提出RedHerring攻击方法，通过修改文本制造分类器与检测器之间的冲突，使检测器误报攻击而分类器保持正确。在4个数据集上对3个检测器和4个分类器进行了测试。

Result: RedHerring攻击能将检测准确率降低20-71个百分点，同时保持（甚至提高）分类器准确率。提出的简单置信度检查防御方法无需重新训练即可大幅提高检测准确率。

Conclusion: 这种新型威胁模型为攻击者如何针对检测模型提供了新的见解，揭示了现有检测系统的脆弱性。

Abstract: In response to adversarial text attacks, attack detection models have been
proposed and shown to successfully identify text modified by adversaries.
Attack detection models can be leveraged to provide an additional check for NLP
models and give signals for human input. However, the reliability of these
models has not yet been thoroughly explored. Thus, we propose and test a novel
attack setting and attack, RedHerring. RedHerring aims to make attack detection
models unreliable by modifying a text to cause the detection model to predict
an attack, while keeping the classifier correct. This creates a tension between
the classifier and detector. If a human sees that the detector is giving an
``incorrect'' prediction, but the classifier a correct one, then the human will
see the detector as unreliable. We test this novel threat model on 4 datasets
against 3 detectors defending 4 classifiers. We find that RedHerring is able to
drop detection accuracy between 20 - 71 points, while maintaining (or
improving) classifier accuracy. As an initial defense, we propose a simple
confidence check which requires no retraining of the classifier or detector and
increases detection accuracy greatly. This novel threat model offers new
insights into how adversaries may target detection models.

### [109] [Overcoming Black-box Attack Inefficiency with Hybrid and Dynamic Select Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20699)
*Abhinay Shankar Belde,Rohit Ramkumar,Jonathan Rusert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种新的攻击选择策略（Hybrid和Dynamic Select），通过结合BinarySelect和GreedySelect的优势，显著降低了对抗性文本攻击所需的查询次数，同时保持攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于transformer的架构复杂性增加，对抗性文本攻击的计算成本急剧上升，现有黑盒攻击方法需要大量查询，对资源有限的研究者来说效率低下且不实用。

Method: Hybrid Select通过引入大小阈值来决定使用哪种选择算法，将广义BinarySelect技术与GreedySelect结合；Dynamic Select通过学习每种选择方法应应用于哪些长度的文本来结合广义Binary和GreedySelect。

Result: 在4个数据集和6个目标模型上，最佳方法（句子级Hybrid Select）能够将每次攻击所需的查询次数平均减少25.82%，同时不损失攻击效果。

Conclusion: 提出的新攻击选择策略有效解决了对抗性文本攻击中的计算效率问题，为资源有限的研究者提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Adversarial text attack research plays a crucial role in evaluating the
robustness of NLP models. However, the increasing complexity of
transformer-based architectures has dramatically raised the computational cost
of attack testing, especially for researchers with limited resources (e.g.,
GPUs). Existing popular black-box attack methods often require a large number
of queries, which can make them inefficient and impractical for researchers. To
address these challenges, we propose two new attack selection strategies called
Hybrid and Dynamic Select, which better combine the strengths of previous
selection algorithms. Hybrid Select merges generalized BinarySelect techniques
with GreedySelect by introducing a size threshold to decide which selection
algorithm to use. Dynamic Select provides an alternative approach of combining
the generalized Binary and GreedySelect by learning which lengths of texts each
selection method should be applied to. This greatly reduces the number of
queries needed while maintaining attack effectiveness (a limitation of
BinarySelect). Across 4 datasets and 6 target models, our best
method(sentence-level Hybrid Select) is able to reduce the number of required
queries per attack up 25.82\% on average against both encoder models and LLMs,
without losing the effectiveness of the attack.

### [110] [MI-Fuse: Label Fusion for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Closed-Source Large-Audio Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20706)
*Hsiao-Ying Huang,Yi-Cheng Lin,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MI-Fuse是一个去噪标签融合框架，通过将大型音频语言模型与源域训练的SER分类器结合作为辅助教师，在目标域无标签数据上训练学生模型，以解决域不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的语音情感识别在域不匹配情况下表现不佳，且源数据不可用，只能通过API访问大型音频语言模型。需要开发一种方法，仅使用无标签目标域音频和API访问的LALM，使学生模型在目标域超越LALM性能。

Method: 提出MI-Fuse框架：使用LALM和源域训练的SER分类器作为双教师；从两个教师获取多个随机预测；基于互信息的不确定性加权平均分布；使用指数移动平均教师稳定训练。

Result: 在三个公共情感数据集和六个跨域转移实验中，学生模型持续超越LALM，比最强基线高出3.9%。

Conclusion: 该方法在不共享源数据的情况下增强了情感感知语音系统，实现了现实可行的适应。

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) show strong zero-shot ability on speech
tasks, suggesting promise for speech emotion recognition (SER). However, SER in
real-world deployments often fails under domain mismatch, where source data are
unavailable and powerful LALMs are accessible only through an API. We ask:
given only unlabeled target-domain audio and an API-only LALM, can a student
model be adapted to outperform the LALM in the target domain? To this end, we
propose MI-Fuse, a denoised label fusion framework that supplements the LALM
with a source-domain trained SER classifier as an auxiliary teacher. The
framework draws multiple stochastic predictions from both teachers, weights
their mean distributions by mutual-information-based uncertainty, and
stabilizes training with an exponential moving average teacher. Experiments
across three public emotion datasets and six cross-domain transfers show
consistent gains, with the student surpassing the LALM and outperforming the
strongest baseline by 3.9%. This approach strengthens emotion-aware speech
systems without sharing source data, enabling realistic adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督神经语法归纳模型面临表达能力瓶颈，导致产生过大但性能不佳的语法模型，核心问题是概率分布坍缩。

Method: 分析了概率分布坍缩在神经参数化关键组件中的出现机制，并引入了坍缩松弛神经参数化方法来解决该问题。

Result: 该方法显著提升了解析性能，同时使得在多种语言中能够使用更紧凑的语法模型，经验分析验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 坍缩松弛神经参数化方法有效解决了无监督语法归纳中的表达能力瓶颈问题，为构建更高效紧凑的语法模型提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised neural grammar induction aims to learn interpretable
hierarchical structures from language data. However, existing models face an
expressiveness bottleneck, often resulting in unnecessarily large yet
underperforming grammars. We identify a core issue, $\textit{probability
distribution collapse}$, as the underlying cause of this limitation. We analyze
when and how the collapse emerges across key components of neural
parameterization and introduce a targeted solution, $\textit{collapse-relaxing
neural parameterization}$, to mitigate it. Our approach substantially improves
parsing performance while enabling the use of significantly more compact
grammars across a wide range of languages, as demonstrated through extensive
empirical analysis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: C2R是一个无需训练的框架，通过构建和精炼子问题及其答案来提升问答任务的置信度评分，适用于文本、图像和视频领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的问答模型在复杂推理任务中置信度评估不够可靠，需要一种能够提升答案可靠性的通用方法。

Method: 首先构建子问题及其答案的集合，探索多样推理路径，然后比较答案候选的置信度分数来选择最可靠的最终答案。

Result: C2R能够与各种现有问答模型无缝集成，在不同模型和基准测试中均表现出性能提升。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了关于子问题数量和质量对模型推理可靠性影响的重要见解，证明了C2R框架的有效性和通用性。

Abstract: We propose Confidence-guided Refinement Reasoning (C2R), a novel
training-free framework applicable to question-answering (QA) tasks across
text, image, and video domains. C2R strategically constructs and refines
sub-questions and their answers (sub-QAs), deriving a better confidence score
for the target answer. C2R first curates a subset of sub-QAs to explore diverse
reasoning paths, then compares the confidence scores of the resulting answer
candidates to select the most reliable final answer. Since C2R relies solely on
confidence scores derived from the model itself, it can be seamlessly
integrated with various existing QA models, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements across diverse models and benchmarks. Furthermore, we
provide essential yet underexplored insights into how leveraging sub-QAs
affects model behavior, specifically analyzing the impact of both the quantity
and quality of sub-QAs on achieving robust and reliable reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了监督微调(SFT)对LLM通用能力的负面影响，发现使用较小的学习率可以显著缓解性能下降，并提出了Token-Adaptive Loss Reweighting(TALR)方法，在保持目标领域性能的同时更好地平衡通用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为SFT会损害LLM的通用能力，本文旨在重新验证这一权衡关系，并寻找缓解性能下降的有效策略。

Method: 通过实证和理论分析，比较了不同学习率的效果，提出了TALR方法，并与L2正则化、LoRA、模型平均、FLOW等基线方法进行对比。

Result: 实验表明小学习率能显著改善权衡关系，TALR在所有基线方法中表现最佳，能更好地平衡领域特定增益和通用能力。

Conclusion: 提出了实用指导原则：使用小学习率获得有利权衡，当需要更强平衡时采用TALR策略。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on domain-specific datasets is a common approach
to adapt Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized tasks but is often
believed to degrade their general capabilities. In this work, we revisit this
trade-off and present both empirical and theoretical insights. First, we show
that SFT does not always hurt: using a smaller learning rate can substantially
mitigate general performance degradation while preserving comparable
target-domain performance. We then provide a theoretical analysis that explains
these phenomena and further motivates a new method, Token-Adaptive Loss
Reweighting (TALR). Building on this, and recognizing that smaller learning
rates alone do not fully eliminate general-performance degradation in all
cases, we evaluate a range of strategies for reducing general capability loss,
including L2 regularization, LoRA, model averaging, FLOW, and our proposed
TALR. Experimental results demonstrate that while no method completely
eliminates the trade-off, TALR consistently outperforms these baselines in
balancing domain-specific gains and general capabilities. Finally, we distill
our findings into practical guidelines for adapting LLMs to new domains: (i)
using a small learning rate to achieve a favorable trade-off, and (ii) when a
stronger balance is further desired, adopt TALR as an effective strategy.

### [114] [Towards Atoms of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20784)
*Chenhui Hu,Pengfei Cao,Yubo Chen,Kang Liu,Jun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了原子理论（Atoms Theory），将大语言模型内部表示的基本单元定义为原子，解决了神经元多义性和特征重建不稳定的问题，并通过理论证明和实验验证了原子能够更准确地捕捉LLMs的内在表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型内部表示的基本单元尚未明确定义，神经元存在多义性问题，特征则面临重建不可靠和不稳定的担忧，这限制了对模型机制的深入理解。

Method: 提出原子理论，引入原子内积（AIP）来校正表示偏移，形式化定义原子，证明原子满足受限等距性质的条件。训练带阈值激活的稀疏自编码器在Gemma2-2B、Gemma2-9B和Llama3.1-8B模型上进行验证。

Result: 实验显示平均99.9%的稀疏重建准确率，99.8%的原子满足唯一性条件（神经元仅0.5%，特征68.2%），表明原子能更忠实捕捉LLMs的内在表示。缩放实验揭示了SAEs大小与恢复能力的关系。

Conclusion: 该工作系统性地提出并验证了LLMs的原子理论，为理解内部表示提供了理论框架，为机制可解释性研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: The fundamental units of internal representations in large language models
(LLMs) remain undefined, limiting further understanding of their mechanisms.
Neurons or features are often regarded as such units, yet neurons suffer from
polysemy, while features face concerns of unreliable reconstruction and
instability. To address this issue, we propose the Atoms Theory, which defines
such units as atoms. We introduce the atomic inner product (AIP) to correct
representation shifting, formally define atoms, and prove the conditions that
atoms satisfy the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), ensuring stable sparse
representations over atom set and linking to compressed sensing. Under stronger
conditions, we further establish the uniqueness and exact $\ell_1$
recoverability of the sparse representations, and provide guarantees that
single-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs) with threshold activations can reliably
identify the atoms. To validate the Atoms Theory, we train threshold-activated
SAEs on Gemma2-2B, Gemma2-9B, and Llama3.1-8B, achieving 99.9% sparse
reconstruction across layers on average, and more than 99.8% of atoms satisfy
the uniqueness condition, compared to 0.5% for neurons and 68.2% for features,
showing that atoms more faithfully capture intrinsic representations of LLMs.
Scaling experiments further reveal the link between SAEs size and recovery
capacity. Overall, this work systematically introduces and validates Atoms
Theory of LLMs, providing a theoretical framework for understanding internal
representations and a foundation for mechanistic interpretability. Code

### [115] [Few-Shot and Training-Free Review Generation via Conversational Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20805)
*Genki Kusano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级的对话式提示方法，通过将用户评论重新表述为多轮对话来改善少样本、免训练场景下的个性化评论生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中经常面临少样本和免训练的情况，现有方法假设用户有大量评论历史或需要额外模型训练，而LLMs虽然能处理低资源设置但效果依赖于提示工程。

Method: 提出了对话式提示方法：简单对话提示(SCP)仅使用用户自身评论，对比对话提示(CCP)插入其他用户或LLMs的错误回复并要求模型纠正，以鼓励生成符合用户风格的文本。

Result: 在8个产品领域和5个LLMs上的实验表明，传统非对话提示生成的评论与随机用户相似，而SCP和CCP生成的评论更接近目标用户，即使在每个用户只有2条评论的情况下也有效。

Conclusion: 对话式提示为少样本和免训练约束下的评论生成提供了实用解决方案，CCP在有高质量负样本时效果更好，SCP在无法收集此类数据时仍具竞争力。

Abstract: Personalized review generation helps businesses understand user preferences,
yet most existing approaches assume extensive review histories of the target
user or require additional model training. Real-world applications often face
few-shot and training-free situations, where only a few user reviews are
available and fine-tuning is infeasible. It is well known that large language
models (LLMs) can address such low-resource settings, but their effectiveness
depends on prompt engineering. In this paper, we propose Conversational
Prompting, a lightweight method that reformulates user reviews as multi-turn
conversations. Its simple variant, Simple Conversational Prompting (SCP),
relies solely on the user's own reviews, while the contrastive variant,
Contrastive Conversational Prompting (CCP), inserts reviews from other users or
LLMs as incorrect replies and then asks the model to correct them, encouraging
the model to produce text in the user's style. Experiments on eight product
domains and five LLMs showed that the conventional non-conversational prompt
often produced reviews similar to those written by random users, based on
text-based metrics such as ROUGE-L and BERTScore, and application-oriented
tasks like user identity matching and sentiment analysis. In contrast, both SCP
and CCP produced reviews much closer to those of the target user, even when
each user had only two reviews. CCP brings further improvements when
high-quality negative examples are available, whereas SCP remains competitive
when such data cannot be collected. These results suggest that conversational
prompting offers a practical solution for review generation under few-shot and
training-free constraints.

TL;DR: 本文提出Enrich-on-Graph（EoG）框架，利用LLMs的先验知识丰富知识图谱，弥合结构化知识图谱与非结构化查询之间的语义鸿沟，在KGQA任务中实现高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在复杂任务中表现出强大的推理能力，但在知识密集型场景（如知识图谱问答）中仍存在幻觉和事实错误问题。这源于结构化知识图谱与非结构化查询之间的语义鸿沟。

Method: 提出灵活的EoG框架，利用LLMs的先验知识丰富知识图谱，通过三个图质量评估指标分析查询-图对齐，实现高效证据提取和精确推理。

Result: 在两个KGQA基准数据集上的实验表明，EoG能有效生成高质量知识图谱，并达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EoG框架能够弥合语义鸿沟，在保证低计算成本、可扩展性和适应性的同时，提升KGQA任务的推理精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities in complex
tasks. However, they still struggle with hallucinations and factual errors in
knowledge-intensive scenarios like knowledge graph question answering (KGQA).
We attribute this to the semantic gap between structured knowledge graphs (KGs)
and unstructured queries, caused by inherent differences in their focuses and
structures. Existing methods usually employ resource-intensive, non-scalable
workflows reasoning on vanilla KGs, but overlook this gap. To address this
challenge, we propose a flexible framework, Enrich-on-Graph (EoG), which
leverages LLMs' prior knowledge to enrich KGs, bridge the semantic gap between
graphs and queries. EoG enables efficient evidence extraction from KGs for
precise and robust reasoning, while ensuring low computational costs,
scalability, and adaptability across different methods. Furthermore, we propose
three graph quality evaluation metrics to analyze query-graph alignment in KGQA
task, supported by theoretical validation of our optimization objectives.
Extensive experiments on two KGQA benchmark datasets indicate that EoG can
effectively generate high-quality KGs and achieve the state-of-the-art
performance. Our code and data are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PoCO是一种新颖的语法错误校正方法，通过先利用大语言模型进行过度校正以提高召回率，然后使用小模型进行后校正来保证精度，从而平衡召回率和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型监督微调语言模型在语法错误校正中可靠性高但倾向于校正不足，导致高精度低召回率；而大语言模型则倾向于过度校正，导致低精度高召回率。需要一种方法结合两者的优势。

Method: PoCO方法分两步：首先故意使用大语言模型进行过度校正以最大化召回率，然后使用微调的小型模型进行有针对性的后校正来识别和修正错误输出。

Result: 实验表明PoCO有效平衡了语法错误校正性能，在保持竞争力的精度同时显著提高了召回率，最终提升了整体校正质量。

Conclusion: PoCO方法成功利用了大语言模型的生成能力和小型监督模型的可靠性，实现了召回率和精度的有效平衡，为语法错误校正提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Robust supervised fine-tuned small Language Models (sLMs) often show high
reliability but tend to undercorrect. They achieve high precision at the cost
of low recall. Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs) often show the opposite
tendency, making excessive overcorrection, leading to low precision. To
effectively harness the strengths of LLMs to address the recall challenges in
sLMs, we propose Post-Correction via Overcorrection (PoCO), a novel approach
that strategically balances recall and precision. PoCO first intentionally
triggers overcorrection via LLM to maximize recall by allowing comprehensive
revisions, then applies a targeted post-correction step via fine-tuning smaller
models to identify and refine erroneous outputs. We aim to harmonize both
aspects by leveraging the generative power of LLMs while preserving the
reliability of smaller supervised models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that PoCO effectively balances GEC performance by increasing recall with
competitive precision, ultimately improving the overall quality of grammatical
error correction.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型多示例上下文学习计算成本高的问题，减少输入token数量

Method: 将多示例ICL的信息提炼为文本摘要（cheat sheet），在推理时使用该摘要作为上下文

Result: 在复杂推理任务上，cheat-sheet ICL使用更少token达到与多示例ICL相当或更好的性能，且无需测试时检索

Conclusion: cheat-sheet ICL是下游任务中利用LLMs的实用替代方案

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable effective in-context
learning (ICL) with many-shot examples, but at the cost of high computational
demand due to longer input tokens. To address this, we propose cheat-sheet ICL,
which distills the information from many-shot ICL into a concise textual
summary (cheat sheet) used as the context at inference time. Experiments on
challenging reasoning tasks show that cheat-sheet ICL achieves comparable or
better performance than many-shot ICL with far fewer tokens, and matches
retrieval-based ICL without requiring test-time retrieval. These findings
demonstrate that cheat-sheet ICL is a practical alternative for leveraging LLMs
in downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在云服务中的广泛应用，用户输入可能无意中暴露敏感信息。现有的文本匿名化技术难以在隐私保护与文本自然性之间取得良好平衡。

Method: 采用零样本、基于树搜索的迭代句子重写算法，通过结构化搜索引导的奖励模型，动态探索重写空间，逐步重写隐私敏感片段。

Result: 在隐私敏感数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有基线方法，在隐私保护和实用性保持之间达到了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM应用中的隐私保护提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够在保护敏感信息的同时维持文本的质量和可用性。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in cloud-based
services has raised significant privacy concerns, as user inputs may
inadvertently expose sensitive information. Existing text anonymization and
de-identification techniques, such as rule-based redaction and scrubbing, often
struggle to balance privacy preservation with text naturalness and utility. In
this work, we propose a zero-shot, tree-search-based iterative sentence
rewriting algorithm that systematically obfuscates or deletes private
information while preserving coherence, relevance, and naturalness. Our method
incrementally rewrites privacy-sensitive segments through a structured search
guided by a reward model, enabling dynamic exploration of the rewriting space.
Experiments on privacy-sensitive datasets show that our approach significantly
outperforms existing baselines, achieving a superior balance between privacy
protection and utility preservation.

Abstract: In retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) question answering systems,
generating citations for large language model (LLM) outputs enhances
verifiability and helps users identify potential hallucinations. However, we
observe two problems in the citations produced by existing attribution methods.
First, the citations are typically provided at the sentence or even paragraph
level. Long sentences or paragraphs may include a substantial amount of
irrelevant content. Second, sentence-level citations may omit information that
is essential for verifying the output, forcing users to read the surrounding
context. In this paper, we propose generating sub-sentence citations that are
both concise and sufficient, thereby reducing the effort required by users to
confirm the correctness of the generated output. To this end, we first develop
annotation guidelines for such citations and construct a corresponding dataset.
Then, we propose an attribution framework for generating citations that adhere
to our standards. This framework leverages LLMs to automatically generate
fine-tuning data for our task and employs a credit model to filter out
low-quality examples. Our experiments on the constructed dataset demonstrate
that the propose approach can generate high-quality and more readable
citations.

### [121] [WeFT: Weighted Entropy-driven Fine-Tuning for dLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20863)
*Guowei Xu,Wenxin Xu,Jiawang Zhao,Kaisheng Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WeFT是一种基于熵加权的监督微调方法，用于解决扩散语言模型在生成过程中缺乏精确概率估计的问题，通过在推理基准测试上实现显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在语言建模中显示出潜力，但缺乏每个去噪步骤的精确概率估计，导致生成过程不可预测和不一致，需要控制关键标记来引导生成方向。

Method: 提出WeFT方法，基于扩散理论为标记分配不同的权重，权重根据标记的熵值确定，实现对扩散语言模型的加权监督微调。

Result: 在s1K、s1K-1.1和3k样本上训练，在Sudoku、Countdown、GSM8K和MATH-500四个推理基准测试上分别实现了39%、64%和83%的相对改进。

Conclusion: WeFT方法有效解决了扩散语言模型监督微调的挑战，显著提升了推理任务的性能，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown strong potential in language modeling,
offering faster generation compared to traditional autoregressive approaches.
However, applying supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to diffusion models remains
challenging, as they lack precise probability estimates at each denoising step.
While the diffusion mechanism enables the model to reason over entire
sequences, it also makes the generation process less predictable and often
inconsistent. This highlights the importance of controlling key tokens that
guide the direction of generation. To address this issue, we propose WeFT, a
weighted SFT method for diffusion language models, where tokens are assigned
different weights based on their entropy. Derived from diffusion theory, WeFT
delivers substantial gains: training on s1K, s1K-1.1, and 3k samples from
open-r1, it achieves relative improvements of 39%, 64%, and 83% over standard
SFT on four widely used reasoning benchmarks (Sudoku, Countdown, GSM8K, and
MATH-500). The code and models will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策通常考虑多个选项而非单一答案，但现有医学推理模型只训练生成单一答案，限制了其实际应用价值。

Method: 采用提示和微调两种方法：监督微调模仿标注响应，强化微调通过奖励函数激励探索；提出针对排名列表格式的新奖励函数。

Result: 强化微调模型在多种答案格式上表现更稳健，模型能够识别有效答案而不仅仅是基准偏好的标准答案。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统研究医学推理模型生成排名列表答案的方法，为开发超越单一答案的替代答案格式提供了初步探索。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study on enabling medical reasoning models
(MRMs) to generate ranked lists of answers for open-ended questions. Clinical
decision-making rarely relies on a single answer but instead considers multiple
options, reducing the risks of narrow perspectives. Yet current MRMs are
typically trained to produce only one answer, even in open-ended settings. We
propose an alternative format: ranked lists and investigate two approaches:
prompting and fine-tuning. While prompting is a cost-effective way to steer an
MRM's response, not all MRMs generalize well across different answer formats:
choice, short text, and list answers. Based on our prompting findings, we train
and evaluate MRMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). SFT teaches a model to imitate annotated responses, and RFT
incentivizes exploration through the responses that maximize a reward. We
propose new reward functions targeted at ranked-list answer formats, and
conduct ablation studies for RFT. Our results show that while some SFT models
generalize to certain answer formats, models trained with RFT are more robust
across multiple formats. We also present a case study on a modified MedQA with
multiple valid answers, finding that although MRMs might fail to select the
benchmark's preferred ground truth, they can recognize valid answers. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation of approaches
for enabling MRMs to generate answers as ranked lists. We hope this work
provides a first step toward developing alternative answer formats that are
beneficial beyond single answers in medical domains.

TL;DR: SummQ是一个新颖的对抗性多智能体框架，通过总结和问答两个互补领域的专业智能体协作，解决了长文档摘要中的信息丢失、事实不一致和连贯性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在长文档摘要任务中存在信息丢失、事实不一致和连贯性问题，需要新的方法来提升摘要质量。

Method: 采用对抗性多智能体框架，包括总结生成器、总结评审器、问答生成器和问答评审器，通过考试智能体验证摘要是否包含回答问答所需信息，实现迭代优化。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的长文档摘要基准测试中，SummQ在ROUGE、BERTScore、LLM-as-a-Judge和人工评估指标上显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了一种利用对抗性智能体协作来改进摘要质量的新方法，为长文档摘要提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Long document summarization remains a significant challenge for current large
language models (LLMs), as existing approaches commonly struggle with
information loss, factual inconsistencies, and coherence issues when processing
excessively long documents. We propose SummQ, a novel adversarial multi-agent
framework that addresses these limitations through collaborative intelligence
between specialized agents operating in two complementary domains:
summarization and quizzing. Our approach employs summary generators and
reviewers that work collaboratively to create and evaluate comprehensive
summaries, while quiz generators and reviewers create comprehension questions
that serve as continuous quality checks for the summarization process. This
adversarial dynamic, enhanced by an examinee agent that validates whether the
generated summary contains the information needed to answer the quiz questions,
enables iterative refinement through multifaceted feedback mechanisms. We
evaluate SummQ on three widely used long document summarization benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods across ROUGE and BERTScore metrics, as well
as in LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluations. Our comprehensive analyses reveal
the effectiveness of the multi-agent collaboration dynamics, the influence of
different agent configurations, and the impact of the quizzing mechanism. This
work establishes a new approach for long document summarization that uses
adversarial agentic collaboration to improve summarization quality.

*Zirui He,Haiyan Zhao,Ali Payani,Mengnan du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemLens是一种通过分析数字令牌生成过程中的概率轨迹来检测记忆化的方法，能够有效识别被污染的数据样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型评估基准容易受到数据污染和记忆化问题的影响，而现有的检测方法主要依赖表面词汇重叠和困惑度，泛化能力差且在处理隐式污染数据时性能显著下降。

Method: 提出MemLens方法，通过分析模型生成过程中数字令牌的概率轨迹来检测记忆化。被污染样本在模型早期层就表现出"捷径"行为，以高置信度锁定答案，而干净样本则在整个模型深度中显示更渐进的证据积累。

Result: 实验发现被污染样本和干净样本展现出明显分离的推理轨迹。通过LoRA微调注入精心设计的样本后，观察到与自然污染数据相同的轨迹模式，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MemLens能够捕捉到真正的记忆化信号而非虚假相关性，为LLM评估中的记忆化检测提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated on challenging benchmarks
such as AIME and Math500, which are susceptible to contamination and risk of
being memorized. Existing detection methods, which primarily rely on
surface-level lexical overlap and perplexity, demonstrate low generalization
and degrade significantly when encountering implicitly contaminated data. In
this paper, we propose MemLens (An Activation Lens for Memorization Detection)
to detect memorization by analyzing the probability trajectories of numeric
tokens during generation. Our method reveals that contaminated samples exhibit
``shortcut'' behaviors, locking onto an answer with high confidence in the
model's early layers, whereas clean samples show more gradual evidence
accumulation across the model's full depth. We observe that contaminated and
clean samples exhibit distinct and well-separated reasoning trajectories. To
further validate this, we inject carefully designed samples into the model
through LoRA fine-tuning and observe the same trajectory patterns as in
naturally contaminated data. These results provide strong evidence that MemLens
captures genuine signals of memorization rather than spurious correlations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This study examines whether sentence-level memory load in comprehension is
better explained by linear proximity between syntactically related words or by
the structural density of the intervening material. Building on locality-based
accounts and cross-linguistic evidence for dependency length minimization, the
work advances Intervener Complexity-the number of intervening heads between a
head and its dependent-as a structurally grounded lens that refines linear
distance measures. Using harmonized dependency treebanks and a mixed-effects
framework across multiple languages, the analysis jointly evaluates sentence
length, dependency length, and Intervener Complexity as predictors of the
Memory-load measure. Studies in Psycholinguistics have reported the
contributions of feature interference and misbinding to memory load during
processing. For this study, I operationalized sentence-level memory load as the
linear sum of feature misbinding and feature interference for tractability;
current evidence does not establish that their cognitive contributions combine
additively. All three factors are positively associated with memory load, with
sentence length exerting the broadest influence and Intervener Complexity
offering explanatory power beyond linear distance. Conceptually, the findings
reconcile linear and hierarchical perspectives on locality by treating
dependency length as an important surface signature while identifying
intervening heads as a more proximate indicator of integration and maintenance
demands. Methodologically, the study illustrates how UD-based graph measures
and cross-linguistic mixed-effects modelling can disentangle linear and
structural contributions to processing efficiency, providing a principled path
for evaluating competing theories of memory load in sentence comprehension.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了阿拉伯语大语言模型的工具调用能力，探讨了阿拉伯语数据训练、通用指令调优和特定工具微调对工具调用性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具调用研究主要集中于英语，缺乏对其他语言（如阿拉伯语）的研究，需要填补这一空白以开发多语言工具增强代理。

Method: 通过将两个开源工具调用数据集翻译和适配为阿拉伯语，在阿拉伯语LLM的基座和后续训练变体上进行广泛实验，分析三种策略的效果。

Result: 研究结果为开发鲁棒的阿拉伯语工具增强代理提供了关键见解，揭示了不同训练策略对工具调用性能的影响。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了阿拉伯语工具调用研究的空白，为多语言工具增强LLM的发展提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Tool calling is a critical capability that allows Large Language Models
(LLMs) to interact with external systems, significantly expanding their
utility. However, research and resources for tool calling are predominantly
English-centric, leaving a gap in our understanding of how to enable this
functionality for other languages, such as Arabic. This paper investigates
three key research questions: (1) the necessity of in-language (Arabic)
tool-calling data versus relying on cross-lingual transfer, (2) the effect of
general-purpose instruction tuning on tool-calling performance, and (3) the
value of fine-tuning on specific, high-priority tools. To address these
questions, we conduct extensive experiments using base and post-trained
variants of an open-weight Arabic LLM. To enable this study, we bridge the
resource gap by translating and adapting two open-source tool-calling datasets
into Arabic. Our findings provide crucial insights into the optimal strategies
for developing robust tool-augmented agents for Arabic.

Motivation: 在LLMs被广泛研究作为学生和教师辅助工具的背景下，本研究旨在开发LLM驱动的自动评估系统，用于学术文本输入问题的评分，以减轻人工评估负担并提高评估效率。

Method: 提出了五种评估系统：JudgeLM评估、参考辅助评估、无参考评估、加法评估和自适应评估。使用三个模型（JudgeLM、Llama-3.1-8B和DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B）在110个计算机科学学生答案数据集上进行测试，并与人工评估结果对比。

Result: 参考辅助评估方法表现最佳，具有最低的中位数绝对偏差（0.945）和均方根偏差（1.214）。其他方法在简洁答案评估或信息完整性方面存在不足。

Conclusion: 基于适当方法论的AI驱动自动评估系统有潜力作为学术资源的补充工具，特别是参考辅助评估方法在自动评分方面表现出色。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can act as evaluators, a role studied by methods
like LLM-as-a-Judge and fine-tuned judging LLMs. In the field of education,
LLMs have been studied as assistant tools for students and teachers. Our
research investigates LLM-driven automatic evaluation systems for academic
Text-Input Problems using rubrics. We propose five evaluation systems that have
been tested on a custom dataset of 110 answers about computer science from
higher education students with three models: JudgeLM, Llama-3.1-8B and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B. The evaluation systems include: The JudgeLM
evaluation, which uses the model's single answer prompt to obtain a score;
Reference Aided Evaluation, which uses a correct answer as a guide aside from
the original context of the question; No Reference Evaluation, which ommits the
reference answer; Additive Evaluation, which uses atomic criteria; and Adaptive
Evaluation, which is an evaluation done with generated criteria fitted to each
question. All evaluation methods have been compared with the results of a human
evaluator. Results show that the best method to automatically evaluate and
score Text-Input Problems using LLMs is Reference Aided Evaluation. With the
lowest median absolute deviation (0.945) and the lowest root mean square
deviation (1.214) when compared to human evaluation, Reference Aided Evaluation
offers fair scoring as well as insightful and complete evaluations. Other
methods such as Additive and Adaptive Evaluation fail to provide good results
in concise answers, No Reference Evaluation lacks information needed to
correctly assess questions and JudgeLM Evaluations have not provided good
results due to the model's limitations. As a result, we conclude that
Artificial Intelligence-driven automatic evaluation systems, aided with proper
methodologies, show potential to work as complementary tools to other academic
resources.

including the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and National Science
Foundation (NSF) Awards, demonstrate how this approach enhances oversight and

TL;DR: 研究表明因果掩码本身就能提供位置信息，与RoPE等显式位置编码相互作用时会扭曲相对注意力模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索因果掩码作为位置信息来源的重要性，分析其与显式位置编码的相互作用。

Method: 通过理论分析和实证研究，证明因果掩码能诱导位置依赖的注意力模式，并分析其与RoPE的相互作用。

Result: 因果掩码倾向于关注附近的查询-键对，与RoPE相互作用时会扭曲相对注意力模式为非相对模式。

Conclusion: 需要将因果掩码视为与显式位置编码同等重要的位置信息来源。

Abstract: While explicit positional encodings such as RoPE are a primary source of
positional information in Transformer decoders, the causal mask also provides
positional information. In this work, we prove that the causal mask can induce
position-dependent patterns in attention scores, even without parameters or
causal dependency in the input. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the
induced attention pattern tends to favor nearby query-key pairs, mirroring the
behavior of common positional encodings. Empirical analysis confirms that
trained models exhibit the same behavior, with learned parameters further
amplifying these patterns. Notably, we found that the interaction of causal
mask and RoPE distorts RoPE's relative attention score patterns into
non-relative ones. We consistently observed this effect in modern large
language models, suggesting the importance of considering the causal mask as a
source of positional information alongside explicit positional encodings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在真实场景中的应用增多，需要系统评估其同时遵循多个指令的能力，但评估所有可能的指令组合在计算上不可行。

Method: 创建ManyIFEval（最多10条指令的文本生成）和StyleMBPP（最多6条指令的代码生成）两个基准，在10个LLM上进行实验，并开发三种回归模型来预测性能。

Result: 实验显示随着指令数量增加，所有模型的性能都持续下降。逻辑回归模型使用指令数量作为解释变量，能以约10%的误差预测未见指令组合的性能。

Conclusion: 相对较小的样本量（ManyIFEval 500个，StyleMBPP 300个）足以进行性能估计，能够高效评估LLM在各种指令组合下的表现。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to real-world
scenarios, it becomes crucial to understand their ability to follow multiple
instructions simultaneously. To systematically evaluate these capabilities, we
introduce two specialized benchmarks for fundamental domains where multiple
instructions following is important: Many Instruction-Following Eval
(ManyIFEval) for text generation with up to ten instructions, and Style-aware
Mostly Basic Programming Problems (StyleMBPP) for code generation with up to
six instructions. Our experiments with the created benchmarks across ten LLMs
reveal that performance consistently degrades as the number of instructions
increases. Furthermore, given the fact that evaluating all the possible
combinations of multiple instructions is computationally impractical in actual
use cases, we developed three types of regression models that can estimate
performance on both unseen instruction combinations and different numbers of
instructions which are not used during training. We demonstrate that a logistic
regression model using instruction count as an explanatory variable can predict
performance of following multiple instructions with approximately 10% error,
even for unseen instruction combinations. We show that relatively modest sample
sizes (500 for ManyIFEval and 300 for StyleMBPP) are sufficient for performance
estimation, enabling efficient evaluation of LLMs under various instruction
combinations.

Motivation: 基础模型在多个领域表现出色，但在复杂多模态工程问题上的性能尚未得到充分探索，特别是在材料强度这类需要结合文本和图表理解的工程任务中。

Method: 提出了图像描述（DoI）提示策略，提供专家生成的图表文本描述作为上下文。评估了8个代表性基础模型（包括LLMs和VLMs）在SoM-1K数据集上的表现。

Result: 当前基础模型在工程问题上表现不佳，最佳模型准确率仅为56.6%。有趣的是，配备DoI的LLMs通常优于直接处理视觉图表的VLMs。错误分析显示DoI能有效减少视觉误解错误。

Conclusion: 这项工作为工程AI建立了严谨的基准，并强调了开发更强大多模态推理能力的迫切需求，特别是在科学和工程背景下。

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable capabilities in various domains, but
their performance on complex, multimodal engineering problems remains largely
unexplored. We introduce SoM-1K, the first large-scale multimodal benchmark
dataset dedicated to evaluating foundation models on problems in the strength
of materials (SoM). The dataset, which contains 1,065 annotated SoM problems,
mirrors real-world engineering tasks by including both textual problem
statements and schematic diagrams. Due to the limited capabilities of current
foundation models in understanding complicated visual information, we propose a
novel prompting strategy called Descriptions of Images (DoI), which provides
rigorous expert-generated text descriptions of the visual diagrams as the
context. We evaluate eight representative foundation models, including both
large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs). Our results
show that current foundation models struggle significantly with these
engineering problems, with the best-performing model achieving only 56.6%
accuracy. Interestingly, we found that LLMs, when provided with DoI, often
outperform VLMs provided with visual diagrams. A detailed error analysis
reveals that DoI plays a crucial role in mitigating visual misinterpretation
errors, suggesting that accurate text-based descriptions can be more effective
than direct image input for current foundation models. This work establishes a
rigorous benchmark for engineering AI and highlights a critical need for
developing more robust multimodal reasoning capabilities in foundation models,
particularly in scientific and engineering contexts.

Motivation: 发现LLMs在生成应用中存在微妙的文化公平性问题，倾向于从主流美国文化视角生成内容，对其他文化表现出外部性偏见。

Method: 提出CultureLens基准（4000个生成提示和3个评估指标），通过文化访谈脚本生成任务量化偏见。开发了两种缓解方法：基于提示的公平干预支柱（FIP）和基于代理的缓解框架（MFA），包括单代理（MFA-SA）和多代理（MFA-MA）两种管道。

Result: 对5个最先进LLMs的评估显示：模型在美国情境脚本中平均88%以上采用内部视角，但对非主流文化主要采用外部立场。基于代理的方法在减轻偏见方面表现出有效性。

Conclusion: 文化定位偏见是LLMs中一个显著问题，基于代理的缓解方法为解决生成式LLMs中的偏见提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked a wide range of downstream
generative applications. However, we found that they also risk perpetuating
subtle fairness issues tied to culture, positioning their generations from the
perspectives of the mainstream US culture while demonstrating salient
externality towards non-mainstream ones. In this work, we identify and
systematically investigate this novel culture positioning bias, in which an
LLM's default generative stance aligns with a mainstream view and treats other
cultures as outsiders. We propose the CultureLens benchmark with 4000
generation prompts and 3 evaluation metrics for quantifying this bias through
the lens of a culturally situated interview script generation task, in which an
LLM is positioned as an onsite reporter interviewing local people across 10
diverse cultures. Empirical evaluation on 5 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a
stark pattern: while models adopt insider tones in over 88 percent of
US-contexted scripts on average, they disproportionately adopt mainly outsider
stances for less dominant cultures. To resolve these biases, we propose 2
inference-time mitigation methods: a baseline prompt-based Fairness
Intervention Pillars (FIP) method, and a structured Mitigation via Fairness
Agents (MFA) framework consisting of 2 pipelines: (1) MFA-SA (Single-Agent)
introduces a self-reflection and rewriting loop based on fairness guidelines.
(2) MFA-MA (Multi-Agent) structures the process into a hierarchy of specialized
agents: a Planner Agent(initial script generation), a Critique Agent (evaluates
initial script against fairness pillars), and a Refinement Agent (incorporates
feedback to produce a polished, unbiased script). Empirical results showcase
the effectiveness of agent-based methods as a promising direction for
mitigating biases in generative LLMs.

TL;DR: PerHalluEval是首个针对波斯语的动态幻觉评估基准，通过三阶段LLM驱动流程和人工验证来检测外源性和内源性幻觉，评估显示LLMs在检测波斯语幻觉文本方面普遍存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决所有大型语言模型在低资源语言（如波斯语）中普遍存在的幻觉问题，填补波斯语幻觉评估基准的空白。

Method: 采用三阶段LLM驱动流程，结合人工验证生成可信的问答和摘要任务答案，利用生成token的对数概率选择最可信的幻觉实例，并引入人工标注突出波斯文化特定内容。

Result: 评估12个开源和闭源LLMs发现模型在检测波斯语幻觉文本方面表现普遍不佳，提供外部知识（如原始文档）可部分缓解幻觉问题，波斯语专门训练的LLMs与其他模型在幻觉方面无显著差异。

Conclusion: 波斯语LLMs在幻觉检测方面存在显著挑战，需要更有效的缓解策略，专门的语言训练并不能显著改善幻觉问题。

Abstract: Hallucination is a persistent issue affecting all large language Models
(LLMs), particularly within low-resource languages such as Persian.
PerHalluEval (Persian Hallucination Evaluation) is the first dynamic
hallucination evaluation benchmark tailored for the Persian language. Our
benchmark leverages a three-stage LLM-driven pipeline, augmented with human
validation, to generate plausible answers and summaries regarding QA and
summarization tasks, focusing on detecting extrinsic and intrinsic
hallucinations. Moreover, we used the log probabilities of generated tokens to
select the most believable hallucinated instances. In addition, we engaged
human annotators to highlight Persian-specific contexts in the QA dataset in
order to evaluate LLMs' performance on content specifically related to Persian
culture. Our evaluation of 12 LLMs, including open- and closed-source models
using PerHalluEval, revealed that the models generally struggle in detecting
hallucinated Persian text. We showed that providing external knowledge, i.e.,
the original document for the summarization task, could mitigate hallucination
partially. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in terms of

### [134] [BESPOKE: Benchmark for Search-Augmented Large Language Model Personalization via Diagnostic Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21106)
*Hyunseo Kim,Sangam Lee,Kwangwook Seo,Dongha Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BESPOKE是一个用于评估搜索增强LLM个性化能力的基准，通过收集真实的人类聊天和搜索历史，结合细粒度偏好评分和反馈，系统性地分析个性化需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有搜索增强LLM在满足多样化用户需求方面仍不足，需要识别相同查询背后的不同用户意图，并以个性化形式提供信息。虽然ChatGPT和Gemini等系统尝试利用用户历史进行个性化，但缺乏系统性评估。

Method: 通过长期深入的人工标注构建BESPOKE基准，收集真实的人类聊天和搜索历史，用户编写具有详细信息需求的查询，并对响应进行评分和诊断反馈。

Result: BESPOKE基准提供了现实且诊断性的评估框架，揭示了信息寻求任务中有效个性化的关键要求。

Conclusion: BESPOKE为个性化搜索增强LLM的细粒度评估奠定了基础，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Search-augmented large language models (LLMs) have advanced
information-seeking tasks by integrating retrieval into generation, reducing
users' cognitive burden compared to traditional search systems. Yet they remain
insufficient for fully addressing diverse user needs, which requires
recognizing how the same query can reflect different intents across users and
delivering information in preferred forms. While recent systems such as ChatGPT
and Gemini attempt personalization by leveraging user histories, systematic
evaluation of such personalization is under-explored. To address this gap, we
propose BESPOKE, the realistic benchmark for evaluating personalization in
search-augmented LLMs. BESPOKE is designed to be both realistic, by collecting
authentic chat and search histories directly from humans, and diagnostic, by
pairing responses with fine-grained preference scores and feedback. The
benchmark is constructed through long-term, deeply engaged human annotation,
where human annotators contributed their own histories, authored queries with
detailed information needs, and evaluated responses with scores and diagnostic
feedback. Leveraging BESPOKE, we conduct systematic analyses that reveal key
requirements for effective personalization in information-seeking tasks,
providing a foundation for fine-grained evaluation of personalized
search-augmented LLMs. Our code and data are available at

### [135] [VoiceBBQ: Investigating Effect of Content and Acoustics in Social Bias of Spoken Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21108)
*Junhyuk Choi,Ro-hoon Oh,Jihwan Seol,Bugeun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VoiceBBQ是BBQ数据集的语音扩展，用于评估语音语言模型在内容和声学两个方面的社会偏见，通过将文本上下文转换为受控语音条件来测量模型的准确性、偏见和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于语音的特性，语音语言模型的社会偏见可能来自内容和声学两个不同来源，需要专门的评估工具来诊断这些偏见。

Method: 将BBQ数据集的每个上下文转换为受控语音条件，评估模型在模糊和明确上下文下的表现，计算每个维度的准确性、偏见和一致性分数。

Result: 评估LLaMA-Omni和Qwen2-Audio两个模型发现：LLaMA-Omni抵抗声学偏见但放大性别和口音偏见，而Qwen2-Audio显著减弱这些线索同时保持内容保真度。

Conclusion: VoiceBBQ提供了一个紧凑的即插即用测试平台，用于联合诊断语音语言模型的内容和声学偏见。

Abstract: We introduce VoiceBBQ, a spoken extension of the BBQ (Bias Benchmark for
Question Answering) - a dataset that measures social bias by presenting
ambiguous or disambiguated contexts followed by questions that may elicit
stereotypical responses. Due to the nature of speech, social bias in Spoken
Language Models (SLMs) can emerge from two distinct sources: 1) content aspect
and 2) acoustic aspect. The dataset converts every BBQ context into controlled
voice conditions, enabling per-axis accuracy, bias, and consistency scores that
remain comparable to the original text benchmark. Using VoiceBBQ, we evaluate
two SLMs - LLaMA-Omni and Qwen2-Audio - and observe architectural contrasts:
LLaMA-Omni resists acoustic bias while amplifying gender and accent bias,
whereas Qwen2-Audio substantially dampens these cues while preserving content
fidelity. VoiceBBQ thus provides a compact, drop-in testbed for jointly
diagnosing content and acoustic bias across spoken language models.

### [136] [Acoustic-based Gender Differentiation in Speech-aware Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21125)
*Junhyuk Choi,Jihwan Seol,Nayeon Kim,Chanhee Cho,EunBin Cho,Bugeun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个新数据集来系统分析语音语言模型中的性别偏见现象，发现了一个矛盾模式：模型在性别刻板印象问题上表现出男性导向的响应，而在需要性别区分的语境中却表现性别无关的响应。这种偏见主要源于Whisper语音编码器生成的男性导向声学标记。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音语言模型虽然改变了人机交互方式，但可能存在基于说话者性别的声学性别区分问题，即相同问题因说话者性别不同而得到不同响应。需要系统分析这一现象。

Method: 构建包含9,208个语音样本的数据集，分为性别无关、性别刻板印象和性别依赖三类。评估LLaMA-Omni系列模型，分析不同性别问题下的响应模式，并比较语音模型与对应骨干语言模型的差异。

Result: 发现矛盾模式：在性别刻板印象问题中，所有模型一致表现出男性导向响应；而在需要性别区分的语境中，模型反而表现出性别无关的响应。这种模式主要源于Whisper语音编码器生成的男性导向声学标记。

Conclusion: 当前语音语言模型未能成功消除性别偏见，虽然优先考虑一般公平原则但忽视了语境适当性，需要更复杂的技术来在语音技术中正确利用性别信息。

Abstract: Speech-aware Language Models (SpeechLMs) have fundamentally transformed
human-AI interaction by enabling voice-based communication, yet they may
exhibit acoustic-based gender differentiation where identical questions lead to
different responses based on the speaker's gender. This paper propose a new
dataset that enables systematic analysis of this phenomenon, containing 9,208
speech samples across three categories: Gender-Independent,
Gender-Stereotypical, and Gender-Dependent. We further evaluated LLaMA-Omni
series and discovered a paradoxical pattern; while overall responses seems
identical regardless of gender, the pattern is far from unbiased responses.
Specifically, in Gender-Stereotypical questions, all models consistently
exhibited male-oriented responses; meanwhile, in Gender-Dependent questions
where gender differentiation would be contextually appropriate, models
exhibited responses independent to gender instead. We also confirm that this
pattern does not result from neutral options nor perceived gender of a voice.
When we allow neutral response, models tends to respond neutrally also in
Gender-Dependent questions. The paradoxical pattern yet retains when we applied
gender neutralization methods on speech. Through comparison between SpeechLMs
with corresponding backbone LLMs, we confirmed that these paradoxical patterns
primarily stem from Whisper speech encoders, which generates male-oriented
acoustic tokens. These findings reveal that current SpeechLMs may not
successfully remove gender biases though they prioritized general fairness
principles over contextual appropriateness, highlighting the need for more
sophisticated techniques to utilize gender information properly in speech
technology.

*Lei Hei,Tingjing Liao,Yingxin Pei,Yiyang Qi,Jiaqi Wang,Ruiting Li,Feiliang Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了ROC框架，将多模态关系抽取重新定义为基于关系语义的检索任务，解决了传统分类方法忽略结构约束和语义表达不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态关系抽取方法采用基于分类的范式，存在两个主要局限：一是忽视实体类型和位置信息等结构约束，二是缺乏对细粒度关系理解的语义表达能力。

Method: ROC框架通过多模态编码器整合实体类型和位置信息，使用大语言模型将关系标签扩展为自然语言描述，并通过基于语义相似度的对比学习对齐实体-关系对。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在MNRE和MORE基准数据集上达到了最先进的性能，并展现出更强的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Conclusion: ROC框架通过检索式方法有效解决了多模态关系抽取中的结构约束和语义表达问题，为关系理解提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Relation extraction (RE) aims to identify semantic relations between entities
in unstructured text. Although recent work extends traditional RE to multimodal
scenarios, most approaches still adopt classification-based paradigms with
fused multimodal features, representing relations as discrete labels. This
paradigm has two significant limitations: (1) it overlooks structural
constraints like entity types and positional cues, and (2) it lacks semantic
expressiveness for fine-grained relation understanding. We propose
\underline{R}etrieval \underline{O}ver \underline{C}lassification (ROC), a
novel framework that reformulates multimodal RE as a retrieval task driven by
relation semantics. ROC integrates entity type and positional information
through a multimodal encoder, expands relation labels into natural language
descriptions using a large language model, and aligns entity-relation pairs via
semantic similarity-based contrastive learning. Experiments show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark datasets MNRE and
MORE and exhibits stronger robustness and interpretability.

*Chantal Shaib,Vinith M. Suriyakumar,Levent Sagun,Byron C. Wallace,Marzyeh Ghassemi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了LLM训练数据中句法模板与领域之间的虚假相关性，发现这种相关性会干扰模型对指令语义的理解，甚至可能被用于绕过安全微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM需要理解任务指令的语义和领域，但句法也会传递隐含信息。研究发现训练数据中句法模板与领域存在虚假相关性，可能导致模型过度依赖句法而非语义。

Method: 使用合成训练数据集分析句法-领域相关性对OLMo-2模型的影响，建立评估框架检测FlanV2数据集中的这种现象，并通过案例研究分析对安全微调的影响。

Result: 句法-领域相关性会降低OLMo-2模型在实体知识任务上的性能（均值0.51±0.06），在OLMo-2-7B、Llama-4-Maverick和GPT-4o等模型中均观察到这种现象，且可被用于绕过安全拒绝机制。

Conclusion: 需要显式测试句法-领域相关性，并确保训练数据在领域内具有句法多样性，以防止此类虚假相关性。

Abstract: For an LLM to correctly respond to an instruction it must understand both the
semantics and the domain (i.e., subject area) of a given task-instruction pair.
However, syntax can also convey implicit information Recent work shows that
syntactic templates--frequent sequences of Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags--are
prevalent in training data and often appear in model outputs. In this work we
characterize syntactic templates, domain, and semantics in task-instruction
pairs. We identify cases of spurious correlations between syntax and domain,
where models learn to associate a domain with syntax during training; this can
sometimes override prompt semantics. Using a synthetic training dataset, we
find that the syntactic-domain correlation can lower performance (mean 0.51 +/-
0.06) on entity knowledge tasks in OLMo-2 models (1B-13B). We introduce an
evaluation framework to detect this phenomenon in trained models, and show that
it occurs on a subset of the FlanV2 dataset in open (OLMo-2-7B;
Llama-4-Maverick), and closed (GPT-4o) models. Finally, we present a case study
on the implications for safety finetuning, showing that unintended
syntactic-domain correlations can be used to bypass refusals in OLMo-2-7B
Instruct and GPT-4o. Our findings highlight two needs: (1) to explicitly test
for syntactic-domain correlations, and (2) to ensure syntactic diversity in
training data, specifically within domains, to prevent such spurious
correlations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幽默是人类的基本特质，其计算理解是NLP中最具挑战性的任务之一。幽默作为抽象、创造性且依赖语境的概念，需要广泛推理能力，是评估现代大语言模型常识知识和推理能力的合适任务。

Method: 采用文献综述的方法，系统梳理计算幽默领域的研究现状，特别关注幽默生成和解释任务，分析当前模型的局限性。

Result: 研究发现，尽管幽默理解具有基础NLP任务的所有特征，但除双关语外的幽默生成和解释研究仍然稀少，最先进模型仍无法达到人类水平。

Conclusion: 强调了计算幽默处理作为NLP子学科的重要性，提出了考虑幽默主观性和伦理模糊性的未来研究方向。

Abstract: The creation and perception of humour is a fundamental human trait,
positioning its computational understanding as one of the most challenging
tasks in natural language processing (NLP). As an abstract, creative, and
frequently context-dependent construct, humour requires extensive reasoning to
understand and create, making it a pertinent task for assessing the
common-sense knowledge and reasoning abilities of modern large language models
(LLMs). In this work, we survey the landscape of computational humour as it
pertains to the generative tasks of creation and explanation. We observe that,
despite the task of understanding humour bearing all the hallmarks of a
foundational NLP task, work on generating and explaining humour beyond puns
remains sparse, while state-of-the-art models continue to fall short of human
capabilities. We bookend our literature survey by motivating the importance of
computational humour processing as a subdiscipline of NLP and presenting an
extensive discussion of future directions for research in the area that takes
into account the subjective and ethically ambiguous nature of humour.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了基于小语言模型（SLM）的聊天机器人的个人身份信息（PII）泄露问题，提出了专门针对PII提取的GEP方法，相比传统模板方法泄露量提升60倍，在自由风格插入场景下仍能达到4.53%的泄露率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然小语言模型在某些领域性能接近大语言模型且能耗更低，但其在下游任务中的个人身份信息泄露风险尚未被充分研究。

Method: 首先基于BioGPT微调了ChatBioGPT聊天机器人，然后提出了基于贪婪坐标梯度的GEP方法专门用于PII提取，并在自由风格插入场景下进行测试。

Result: GEP方法相比传统模板方法泄露量提升60倍，在复杂现实场景下仍能达到4.53%的PII泄露率。

Conclusion: 基于SLM的聊天机器人存在严重的PII泄露风险，需要开发更有效的防护措施，GEP方法为PII泄露检测提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) become unprecedentedly appealing due to their
approximately equivalent performance compared to large language models (LLMs)
in certain fields with less energy and time consumption during training and
inference. However, the personally identifiable information (PII) leakage of
SLMs for downstream tasks has yet to be explored. In this study, we investigate
the PII leakage of the chatbot based on SLM. We first finetune a new chatbot,
i.e., ChatBioGPT based on the backbone of BioGPT using medical datasets Alpaca
and HealthCareMagic. It shows a matchable performance in BERTscore compared
with previous studies of ChatDoctor and ChatGPT. Based on this model, we prove
that the previous template-based PII attacking methods cannot effectively
extract the PII in the dataset for leakage detection under the SLM condition.
We then propose GEP, which is a greedy coordinate gradient-based (GCG) method
specifically designed for PII extraction. We conduct experimental studies of
GEP and the results show an increment of up to 60$\times$ more leakage compared
with the previous template-based methods. We further expand the capability of
GEP in the case of a more complicated and realistic situation by conducting
free-style insertion where the inserted PII in the dataset is in the form of
various syntactic expressions instead of fixed templates, and GEP is still able
to reveal a PII leakage rate of up to 4.53%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在科学推理中的两个主要瓶颈：显式检索会中断推理过程并增加额外开销，多智能体流水线会稀释强解决方案

Method: 基于Monitor的隐式检索模块在token级别整合外部知识，采用分层解决方案优化(HSR)和质量感知迭代推理(QAIR)进行结构化协作

Result: 在Humanity's Last Exam Bio/Chem Gold上达到48.3%准确率，比最强基线提升13.4点，同时减少53.5%的token使用和43.7%的步骤数

Conclusion: 隐式增强和结构化优化能够克服显式工具使用和统一聚合的低效性，错误分析显示推理失败和知识缺口在85%以上情况下同时出现

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong progress on
scientific reasoning, yet two major bottlenecks remain. First, explicit
retrieval fragments reasoning, imposing a hidden "tool tax" of extra tokens and
steps. Second, multi-agent pipelines often dilute strong solutions by averaging
across all candidates. We address these challenges with a unified framework
that combines implicit retrieval and structured collaboration. At its
foundation, a Monitor-based retrieval module operates at the token level,
integrating external knowledge with minimal disruption to reasoning. On top of
this substrate, Hierarchical Solution Refinement (HSR) iteratively designates
each candidate as an anchor to be repaired by its peers, while Quality-Aware
Iterative Reasoning (QAIR) adapts refinement to solution quality. On Humanity's
Last Exam (HLE) Bio/Chem Gold, our framework achieves 48.3\% accuracy -- the
highest reported to date, surpassing the strongest agent baseline by 13.4
points and leading frontier LLMs by up to 18.1 points, while simultaneously
reducing token usage by 53.5\% and agent steps by 43.7\%. Results on SuperGPQA
and TRQA confirm robustness across domains. Error analysis shows that reasoning
failures and knowledge gaps co-occur in over 85\% of cases, while diversity
analysis reveals a clear dichotomy: retrieval tasks benefit from solution
variety, whereas reasoning tasks favor consensus. Together, these findings
demonstrate how implicit augmentation and structured refinement overcome the
inefficiencies of explicit tool use and uniform aggregation. Code is available

TL;DR: 本文介绍了CLaw基准，用于评估LLMs在中国法律知识和推理应用方面的能力，发现现有模型在法律条款准确检索方面存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在法律文本分析中可靠性不足，因为通用预训练缺乏对法律知识的专门关注，需要专门基准来评估其法律推理能力。

Method: 构建包含306部中国国家法规的细粒度语料库（64,849条目）和254个基于最高法院案例的推理实例，通过实证评估分析LLMs表现。

Result: 实证评估显示大多数当代LLMs难以准确再现法律条款，这严重影响了其法律推理的可靠性。

Conclusion: 实现可信的法律推理需要准确知识检索与强大推理能力的协同，建议通过SFT或RAG等技术增强检索能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with analyzing legal
texts and citing relevant statutes, yet their reliability is often compromised
by general pre-training that ingests legal texts without specialized focus,
obscuring the true depth of their legal knowledge. This paper introduces CLaw,
a novel benchmark specifically engineered to meticulously evaluate LLMs on
Chinese legal knowledge and its application in reasoning. CLaw comprises two
key components: (1) a comprehensive, fine-grained corpus of all 306 Chinese
national statutes, segmented to the subparagraph level and incorporating
precise historical revision timesteps for rigorous recall evaluation (64,849
entries), and (2) a challenging set of 254 case-based reasoning instances
derived from China Supreme Court curated materials to assess the practical
application of legal knowledge. Our empirical evaluation reveals that most
contemporary LLMs significantly struggle to faithfully reproduce legal
provisions. As accurate retrieval and citation of legal provisions form the
basis of legal reasoning, this deficiency critically undermines the reliability
of their responses. We contend that achieving trustworthy legal reasoning in
LLMs requires a robust synergy of accurate knowledge retrieval--potentially
enhanced through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG)--and strong general reasoning capabilities. This work provides an
essential benchmark and critical insights for advancing domain-specific LLM
reasoning, particularly within the complex legal sphere.

TL;DR: SGMem是一种句子图记忆方法，用于解决长对话中超出LLM上下文窗口的问题，通过构建句子级图结构来组织不同粒度的对话信息，在长对话问答任务中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于事实提取或摘要的方法虽然减少了冗余，但难以组织和检索不同粒度的对话信息和生成记忆，需要更有效的长期对话记忆管理方法。

Method: SGMem将对话表示为分块单元内的句子级图，捕捉轮次、回合和会话级别的关联，结合检索到的原始对话与生成的记忆（如摘要、事实和见解），为LLM提供连贯相关的上下文。

Result: 在LongMemEval和LoCoMo数据集上的实验表明，SGMem持续提高了准确性，并在长期对话问答任务中优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: SGMem通过句子图结构有效管理长期对话记忆，为LLM提供更好的上下文支持，在长对话场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Long-term conversational agents require effective memory management to handle
dialogue histories that exceed the context window of large language models
(LLMs). Existing methods based on fact extraction or summarization reduce
redundancy but struggle to organize and retrieve relevant information across
different granularities of dialogue and generated memory. We introduce SGMem
(Sentence Graph Memory), which represents dialogue as sentence-level graphs
within chunked units, capturing associations across turn-, round-, and
session-level contexts. By combining retrieved raw dialogue with generated
memory such as summaries, facts and insights, SGMem supplies LLMs with coherent
and relevant context for response generation. Experiments on LongMemEval and
LoCoMo show that SGMem consistently improves accuracy and outperforms strong
baselines in long-term conversational question answering.

Motivation: 现有的图RAG方法面临粒度困境：细粒度实体级图会产生高token成本并丢失上下文，而粗粒度文档级图无法捕捉细微关系。

Method: 使用Doc2Query和Doc2Query--构建具有可控粒度的查询中心图，并采用定制的多跳检索机制通过生成的查询选择相关块。

Result: 在LiHuaWorld和MultiHop-RAG数据集上的实验表明，QCG-RAG在问答准确性上持续优于现有的基于块和基于图的RAG方法。

Conclusion: QCG-RAG为多跳推理建立了一个新范式，通过查询中心的方法提高了图质量和可解释性。

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enriches large language
models (LLMs) with external knowledge for long-context understanding and
multi-hop reasoning, but existing methods face a granularity dilemma:
fine-grained entity-level graphs incur high token costs and lose context, while
coarse document-level graphs fail to capture nuanced relations. We introduce
QCG-RAG, a query-centric graph RAG framework that enables query-granular
indexing and multi-hop chunk retrieval. Our query-centric approach leverages
Doc2Query and Doc2Query{-}{-} to construct query-centric graphs with
controllable granularity, improving graph quality and interpretability. A
tailored multi-hop retrieval mechanism then selects relevant chunks via the
generated queries. Experiments on LiHuaWorld and MultiHop-RAG show that QCG-RAG
consistently outperforms prior chunk-based and graph-based RAG methods in
question answering accuracy, establishing a new paradigm for multi-hop
reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同音异义词（拼写相同但含义不同的词）对生成模型构成挑战，扩散模型在处理包含同音异义词的提示时可能同时生成该词的多个含义，导致同音异义词重复问题。此外，英语中心偏见使得非英语原词在翻译成英语后也可能变成同音异义词。

Method: 引入测量重复率的方法，使用视觉语言模型（VLM）进行自动评估和人工评估，研究通过提示扩展来缓解同音异义词重复问题。

Result: 评估了不同扩散模型的同音异义词重复问题，发现提示扩展方法能有效减少重复，包括由英语中心偏见引起的重复问题。

Conclusion: 同音异义词重复是扩散模型的一个重要问题，提出的评估方法和提示扩展技术能够有效识别和缓解这一问题，自动评估代码已公开。

Abstract: Homonyms are words with identical spelling but distinct meanings, which pose
challenges for many generative models. When a homonym appears in a prompt,
diffusion models may generate multiple senses of the word simultaneously, which
is known as homonym duplication. This issue is further complicated by an
Anglocentric bias, which includes an additional translation step before the
text-to-image model pipeline. As a result, even words that are not homonymous
in the original language may become homonyms and lose their meaning after
translation into English. In this paper, we introduce a method for measuring
duplication rates and conduct evaluations of different diffusion models using
both automatic evaluation utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLM) and human
evaluation. Additionally, we investigate methods to mitigate the homonym
duplication problem through prompt expansion, demonstrating that this approach
also effectively reduces duplication related to Anglocentric bias. The code for
the automatic evaluation pipeline is publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作未能以任务相关的方式概念化多样性，而不同任务对输出同质化的定义和期望各不相同（如数学任务期望答案一致但解法多样，创意写作任务期望关键叙事元素多样）。

Method: 提出了包含八个任务类别的分类法，定义了任务锚定的功能多样性评估指标，开发了任务锚定采样技术，在需要多样性的任务类别中增加功能多样性，在需要一致性的任务类别中保持同质化。

Result: 成功提高了功能多样性，同时保持了响应质量，挑战了多样性-质量权衡的普遍认知。

Conclusion: 任务依赖性显著改善了输出同质化的评估和缓解，为LLM输出多样性提供了更精细的解决方案。

Abstract: A large language model can be less helpful if it exhibits output response
homogenization. But whether two responses are considered homogeneous, and
whether such homogenization is problematic, both depend on the task category.
For instance, in objective math tasks, we often expect no variation in the
final answer but anticipate variation in the problem-solving strategy. Whereas,
for creative writing tasks, we may expect variation in key narrative components
(e.g. plot, genre, setting, etc), beyond the vocabulary or embedding diversity
produced by temperature-sampling. Previous work addressing output
homogenization often fails to conceptualize diversity in a task-dependent way.
We address this gap in the literature directly by making the following
contributions. (1) We present a task taxonomy comprised of eight task
categories that each have distinct conceptualizations of output homogenization.
(2) We introduce task-anchored functional diversity to better evaluate output
homogenization. (3) We propose a task-anchored sampling technique that
increases functional diversity for task categories where homogenization is
undesired, while preserving homogenization where it is desired. (4) We
challenge the perceived existence of a diversity-quality trade-off by
increasing functional diversity while maintaining response quality. Overall, we
demonstrate how task dependence improves the evaluation and mitigation of
output homogenization.

TL;DR: LLMTrace是一个新的大规模双语语料库，用于AI生成文本检测，支持全文二元分类和AI生成区间检测任务


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集存在局限性：使用过时模型生成、主要为英语、缺乏混合人机写作场景、没有字符级标注来精确定位AI生成片段

Method: 使用多样化的现代专有和开源LLM构建双语（英语和俄语）数据集，提供字符级标注支持AI生成区间检测

Result: 创建了LLMTrace语料库，支持传统全文分类和新型AI生成区间检测任务

Conclusion: LLMTrace将成为训练和评估下一代更细致实用的AI检测模型的重要资源

Abstract: The widespread use of human-like text from Large Language Models (LLMs)
necessitates the development of robust detection systems. However, progress is
limited by a critical lack of suitable training data; existing datasets are
often generated with outdated models, are predominantly in English, and fail to
address the increasingly common scenario of mixed human-AI authorship.
Crucially, while some datasets address mixed authorship, none provide the
character-level annotations required for the precise localization of
AI-generated segments within a text. To address these gaps, we introduce
LLMTrace, a new large-scale, bilingual (English and Russian) corpus for
AI-generated text detection. Constructed using a diverse range of modern
proprietary and open-source LLMs, our dataset is designed to support two key
tasks: traditional full-text binary classification (human vs. AI) and the novel
task of AI-generated interval detection, facilitated by character-level
annotations. We believe LLMTrace will serve as a vital resource for training
and evaluating the next generation of more nuanced and practical AI detection
models. The project page is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文从理论上分析了输入扰动对Chain-of-Thought（CoT）输出波动的影响，推导了输出波动可接受范围内的输入扰动上界，并证明了该上界与推理步数正相关，且无限长推理过程无法消除输入扰动的影响。在线性自注意力模型上的分析表明，输入扰动上界与输入嵌入和隐藏状态向量的范数负相关。实验验证了理论分析的正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明CoT输出受输入扰动影响显著，但缺乏对扰动如何影响CoT输出的理论解释，限制了深入理解扰动在推理过程中的传播机制，阻碍了提示优化方法的进一步改进。

Method: 首先推导输出波动可接受范围内的输入扰动上界，证明该上界与推理步数的正相关性及无限长推理无法消除扰动影响。然后将结论应用于线性自注意力模型，分析输入扰动上界与向量范数的关系。最后在三个主流数据集和四个主流模型上进行实验验证。

Result: 理论分析表明：输入扰动上界与CoT推理步数正相关；无限长推理过程无法消除输入扰动影响；在线性自注意力模型中，输入扰动上界与输入嵌入和隐藏状态向量的范数负相关。实验结果与理论分析一致。

Conclusion: 本文首次从理论角度分析了输入扰动对CoT输出的影响机制，为理解扰动传播提供了理论框架，对改进提示优化方法具有指导意义。实验验证了理论分析的正确性，填补了该领域的研究空白。

Abstract: Existing research indicates that the output of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is
significantly affected by input perturbations. Although many methods aim to
mitigate such impact by optimizing prompts, a theoretical explanation of how
these perturbations influence CoT outputs remains an open area of research.
This gap limits our in-depth understanding of how input perturbations propagate
during the reasoning process and hinders further improvements in prompt
optimization methods. Therefore, in this paper, we theoretically analyze the
effect of input perturbations on the fluctuation of CoT outputs. We first
derive an upper bound for input perturbations under the condition that the
output fluctuation is within an acceptable range, based on which we prove that:
(i) This upper bound is positively correlated with the number of reasoning
steps in the CoT; (ii) Even an infinitely long reasoning process cannot
eliminate the impact of input perturbations. We then apply these conclusions to
the Linear Self-Attention (LSA) model, which can be viewed as a simplified
version of the Transformer. For the LSA model, we prove that the upper bound
for input perturbation is negatively correlated with the norms of the input
embedding and hidden state vectors. To validate this theoretical analysis, we
conduct experiments on three mainstream datasets and four mainstream models.
The experimental results align with our theoretical analysis, empirically
demonstrating the correctness of our findings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DisCoCLIP是一种多模态编码器，结合了冻结的CLIP视觉变换器和新型张量网络文本编码器，通过显式编码句法结构来改进视觉语言模型的组合推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在大规模图像-文本对齐方面表现出色，但往往忽略语言的结构组合性，导致在依赖词序和谓词-论元结构的任务上表现不佳。

Method: 使用组合范畴语法解析器解析句子生成分布词张量，通过张量分解降低参数数量，采用自监督对比损失进行端到端训练。

Result: DisCoCLIP显著提升了对动词语义和词序的敏感性：将CLIP的SVO-Probes动词准确率从77.6%提升至82.4%，ARO归因和关系分数分别提升超过9%和4%，在SVO-Swap基准上达到93.7%。

Conclusion: 通过张量网络嵌入显式语言结构可以产生可解释、参数高效的表示，显著改善视觉语言任务中的组合推理能力。

Abstract: Recent vision-language models excel at large-scale image-text alignment but
often neglect the compositional structure of language, leading to failures on
tasks that hinge on word order and predicate-argument structure. We introduce
DisCoCLIP, a multimodal encoder that combines a frozen CLIP vision transformer
with a novel tensor network text encoder that explicitly encodes syntactic
structure. Sentences are parsed with a Combinatory Categorial Grammar parser to
yield distributional word tensors whose contractions mirror the sentence's
grammatical derivation. To keep the model efficient, high-order tensors are
factorized with tensor decompositions, reducing parameter count from tens of
millions to under one million. Trained end-to-end with a self-supervised
contrastive loss, DisCoCLIP markedly improves sensitivity to verb semantics and
word order: it raises CLIP's SVO-Probes verb accuracy from 77.6% to 82.4%,
boosts ARO attribution and relation scores by over 9% and 4%, and achieves
93.7% on a newly introduced SVO-Swap benchmark. These results demonstrate that
embedding explicit linguistic structure via tensor networks yields
interpretable, parameter-efficient representations that substantially improve
compositional reasoning in vision-language tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自下而上的合成数据生成方法，通过利用大型开源LLM基于语言特定的维基百科内容创建文化语境化的印度语言数据集Updesh，该数据集包含950万条数据点，涵盖13种印度语言，旨在解决多语言AI系统在低资源环境中的文化适应性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发在多语言环境中有效运作且保持文化适应性的AI系统是一个长期挑战，特别是在低资源设置中。合成数据提供了一个有前景的途径，但其在多语言和多元文化背景下的有效性尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 采用自下而上的生成策略，提示大型开源LLM（参数≥235B）基于语言特定的维基百科内容进行数据生成，补充了从英语等高资源语言翻译合成数据集的主导自上而下范式。

Result: 通过自动指标和人工评估的综合评估表明生成的数据质量高，但人工评估也指出了需要进一步改进的领域。在下游评估中，使用Updesh数据集微调的模型在生成任务上持续获得显著提升，并在多项选择式NLU任务上保持竞争力，特别是在低和中资源语言中相对改进最为明显。

Conclusion: 这些发现提供了经验证据，表明有效的多语言AI需要结合情境感知、文化基础方法的多方面数据策展和生成策略。

Abstract: Developing AI systems that operate effectively across languages while
remaining culturally grounded is a long-standing challenge, particularly in
low-resource settings. Synthetic data provides a promising avenue, yet its
effectiveness in multilingual and multicultural contexts remains underexplored.
We investigate the creation and impact of synthetic, culturally contextualized
datasets for Indian languages through a bottom-up generation strategy that
prompts large open-source LLMs (>= 235B parameters) to ground data generation
in language-specific Wikipedia content. This approach complements the dominant
top-down paradigm of translating synthetic datasets from high-resource
languages such as English. We introduce Updesh, a high-quality large-scale
synthetic instruction-following dataset comprising 9.5M data points across 13
Indian languages, encompassing diverse reasoning and generative tasks with an
emphasis on long-context, multi-turn capabilities, and alignment with Indian
cultural contexts. A comprehensive evaluation incorporating both automated
metrics and human annotation across 10k assessments indicates that generated
data is high quality; though, human evaluation highlights areas for further
improvement. Additionally, we perform downstream evaluations by fine-tuning
models on our dataset and assessing the performance across 15 diverse
multilingual datasets. Models trained on Updesh consistently achieve
significant gains on generative tasks and remain competitive on multiple-choice
style NLU tasks. Notably, relative improvements are most pronounced in low and
medium-resource languages, narrowing their gap with high-resource languages.
These findings provide empirical evidence that effective multilingual AI
requires multi-faceted data curation and generation strategies that incorporate
context-aware, culturally grounded methodologies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文将大语言模型中的谄媚行为分解为谄媚性同意和谄媚性赞美，通过实验证明这两种行为在潜在空间中具有不同的线性方向，可以独立调控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型中谄媚行为的机制，探究这些行为是否源于单一机制还是多个不同的过程。

Method: 使用均值差异方向、激活添加和子空间几何分析，在多个模型和数据集上对比谄媚性同意、谄媚性赞美和真诚同意三种行为。

Result: 发现三种行为在潜在空间中沿不同的线性方向编码，可以独立放大或抑制而不相互影响，且这种表示结构在不同模型家族和规模中保持一致。

Conclusion: 谄媚行为对应于不同的、可独立调控的表示，而非单一机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit sycophantic behaviors -- such as
excessive agreement with or flattery of the user -- but it is unclear whether
these behaviors arise from a single mechanism or multiple distinct processes.
We decompose sycophancy into sycophantic agreement and sycophantic praise,
contrasting both with genuine agreement. Using difference-in-means directions,
activation additions, and subspace geometry across multiple models and
datasets, we show that: (1) the three behaviors are encoded along distinct
linear directions in latent space; (2) each behavior can be independently
amplified or suppressed without affecting the others; and (3) their
representational structure is consistent across model families and scales.
These results suggest that sycophantic behaviors correspond to distinct,
independently steerable representations.

TL;DR: RLBFF结合人类偏好和规则验证，通过二元灵活反馈提升奖励模型性能，在多个基准测试中达到最优表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RLHF缺乏可解释性和奖励攻击问题，以及RLVR局限于正确性验证的不足，需要一种能捕捉响应质量细微差别的方法。

Method: 从自然语言反馈中提取可二元回答的原则，将奖励模型训练构建为蕴含任务，判断响应是否满足任意原则。

Result: 在RM-Bench达到86.2%，JudgeBench达到81.4%（截至2025年9月排名第一），对齐Qwen3-32B后在MT-Bench等基准上匹配或超越o3-mini和DeepSeek R1性能。

Conclusion: RLBFF提供了一种开源解决方案，结合了人类反馈的灵活性和规则验证的精确性，在推理成本低于5%的情况下实现卓越性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are the main RL paradigms used in LLM
post-training, each offering distinct advantages. However, RLHF struggles with
interpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that
usually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focus
on correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary
Flexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven
preferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward
models to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness.
RLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g.
accuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language
feedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training as
an entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary
principle). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperform
Bradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on
RM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24,
2025). Additionally, users can specify principles of interest at inference time
to customize the focus of our reward models, in contrast to Bradley-Terry
models. Finally, we present a fully open source recipe (including data) to
align Qwen3-32B using RLBFF and our Reward Model, to match or exceed the
performance of o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on general alignment benchmarks of
MT-Bench, WildBench, and Arena Hard v2 (at <5% of the inference cost).

Motivation: 现有的生成流网络使用流匹配损失学习生成对象的随机策略，但缺乏多智能体环境下的理论框架。

Method: 提出了MA-GFlowNets理论框架，包括集中式流网络、独立流网络、联合流网络及其条件版本四种算法，基于局部-全局原则进行训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提框架在性能上优于强化学习和基于MCMC的方法。

Conclusion: MA-GFlowNets为多智能体协作生成提供了理论保证，能够以与奖励函数成比例的概率生成样本。

Abstract: Generative flow networks utilize a flow-matching loss to learn a stochastic
policy for generating objects from a sequence of actions, such that the
probability of generating a pattern can be proportional to the corresponding
given reward. However, a theoretical framework for multi-agent generative flow
networks (MA-GFlowNets) has not yet been proposed. In this paper, we propose
the theory framework of MA-GFlowNets, which can be applied to multiple agents
to generate objects collaboratively through a series of joint actions. We
further propose four algorithms: a centralized flow network for centralized
training of MA-GFlowNets, an independent flow network for decentralized
execution, a joint flow network for achieving centralized training with
decentralized execution, and its updated conditional version. Joint Flow
training is based on a local-global principle allowing to train a collection of
(local) GFN as a unique (global) GFN. This principle provides a loss of
reasonable complexity and allows to leverage usual results on GFN to provide
theoretical guarantees that the independent policies generate samples with
probability proportional to the reward function. Experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework compared to reinforcement
learning and MCMC-based methods.

TL;DR: FastEagle是一种非自回归级联草稿器，通过单次前向传播生成整个草稿，取代了传统草稿器的顺序依赖，实现了更快的推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的草稿器（如EAGLE）需要N次顺序传递来生成N个标记，存在效率瓶颈。FastEagle旨在通过消除顺序依赖性来加速LLM推理。

Method: 使用轻量级层级联替代时间步骤，采用层间监督训练来减轻错误累积，结合约束草稿树保持无损验证成本。

Result: 在多个LLM和任务上，FastEagle在贪心和随机解码下均优于EAGLE-3，速度提升显著，同时保持可接受的平均接受长度。

Conclusion: 消除草稿生成中的顺序依赖是实现无损LLM推理加速的可行路径。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates generation by drafting candidates and
verifying them in parallel, yet state-of-the-art drafters (e.g., EAGLE) still
require N sequential passes to propose N tokens. We present FastEagle, a
non-autoregressive cascaded drafter that emits an entire draft in a single
forward pass. FastEagle replaces temporal steps with a lightweight layer
cascade and trains with layer-wise supervision to mitigate error accumulation.
Coupled with a constrained draft tree that preserves lossless verification
cost, FastEagle delivers substantial wall-clock speedups over strong
autoregressive drafters while maintaining competitive acceptance behavior.
Across multiple LLMs (Vicuna-13B, LLaMA-Instruct 3.x, and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA) and tasks (MT-Bench, HumanEval, GSM8K, CNN/DM,
Alpaca), FastEagle consistently outperforms EAGLE-3 in speedup under both
greedy and stochastic decoding, with comparable average acceptance lengths.
These results indicate that removing sequential dependencies in drafting is a
practical path toward lossless LLM inference acceleration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数CMIP气候模型由于计算成本高而缺乏交互式臭氧表示，这限制了气候敏感性模拟的准确性

Method: 使用机器学习参数化方法，仅需大气温度剖面信息作为输入，即可模拟对流层和平流层的日臭氧变化和趋势

Result: mloz在UKESM和ICON两种气候模型中均表现出高保真度，运行速度比UKESM化学方案快31倍，仅占模型总运行时间的不到4%

Conclusion: 该方法具有在缺乏交互化学的CMIP级气候模型中广泛应用的潜力，特别是在关注气候敏感性模拟时，臭氧变化对大气反馈过程有显著影响

Abstract: Atmospheric ozone is a crucial absorber of solar radiation and an important
greenhouse gas. However, most climate models participating in the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project (CMIP) still lack an interactive representation of
ozone due to the high computational costs of atmospheric chemistry schemes.
Here, we introduce a machine learning parameterization (mloz) to interactively
model daily ozone variability and trends across the troposphere and
stratosphere in standard climate sensitivity simulations, including two-way
interactions of ozone with the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation. We demonstrate its
high fidelity on decadal timescales and its flexible use online across two
different climate models -- the UK Earth System Model (UKESM) and the German
ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model. With atmospheric temperature profile
information as the only input, mloz produces stable ozone predictions around 31
times faster than the chemistry scheme in UKESM, contributing less than 4
percent of the respective total climate model runtimes. In particular, we also
demonstrate its transferability to different climate models without chemistry
schemes by transferring the parameterization from UKESM to ICON. This
highlights the potential for widespread adoption in CMIP-level climate models
that lack interactive chemistry for future climate change assessments,
particularly when focusing on climate sensitivity simulations, where ozone
trends and variability are known to significantly modulate atmospheric feedback
processes.

Motivation: 随着EEG消费设备的普及，用户隐私保护需求日益迫切，需要在保留EEG数据应用价值的同时防止个人信息泄露。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的自编码器对EEG数据进行匿名化处理，在自动睡眠分期任务上评估重识别风险和实用性。

Result: EEG信号的重识别能力显著降低，同时机器学习任务的实用性得到保持。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效平衡EEG数据的隐私保护和实用性，为EEG数据的安全使用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used for recording brain activity and
has seen numerous applications in machine learning, such as detecting sleep
stages and neurological disorders. Several studies have successfully shown the
potential of EEG data for re-identification and leakage of other personal
information. Therefore, the increasing availability of EEG consumer devices
raises concerns about user privacy, motivating us to investigate how to
safeguard this sensitive data while retaining its utility for EEG applications.
To address this challenge, we propose a transformer-based autoencoder to create
EEG data that does not allow for subject re-identification while still
retaining its utility for specific machine learning tasks. We apply our
approach to automatic sleep staging by evaluating the re-identification and
utility potential of EEG data before and after anonymization. The results show
that the re-identifiability of the EEG signal can be substantially reduced
while preserving its utility for machine learning.

Abstract: Influence estimation tools -- such as memorization scores -- are widely used
to understand model behavior, attribute training data, and inform dataset
curation. However, recent applications in data valuation and responsible
machine learning raise the question: can these scores themselves be
adversarially manipulated? In this work, we present a systematic study of the
feasibility of attacking memorization-based influence estimators. We
characterize attacks for producing highly memorized samples as highly sensitive
queries in the regime where a trained algorithm is accurate. Our attack
(calculating the pseudoinverse of the input) is practical, requiring only
black-box access to model outputs and incur modest computational overhead. We
empirically validate our attack across a wide suite of image classification
tasks, showing that even state-of-the-art proxies are vulnerable to targeted
score manipulations. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the
stability of memorization scores under adversarial perturbations, revealing
conditions under which influence estimates are inherently fragile. Our findings
highlight critical vulnerabilities in influence-based attribution and suggest
the need for robust defenses. All code can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的目标条件强化学习方法中，对比表示和时序距离两种框架各有优势但存在局限性。对比表示方法在随机环境中稳定但缺乏拼接能力，而拟度量网络方法具有拼接能力但在噪声高维环境中表现不佳。

Method: 提出了一种统一框架，结合拟度量表示空间的三角不等式结构和适当的约束条件，学习能够实现最优目标到达的后继表示。该方法能够在次优数据和随机环境中学习最优目标到达距离。

Result: 在现有离线GCRL基准测试中，该方法在对比学习方法难以处理的拼接任务上表现更好，同时在拟度量网络方法难以处理的高维噪声环境中也表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法结合了对比表示方法的稳定性和长时程能力，以及拟度量网络参数化的自由拼接能力，实现了两种框架的优势互补。

Abstract: Approaches for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) often use
learned state representations to extract goal-reaching policies. Two frameworks
for representation structure have yielded particularly effective GCRL
algorithms: (1) *contrastive representations*, in which methods learn
"successor features" with a contrastive objective that performs inference over
future outcomes, and (2) *temporal distances*, which link the (quasimetric)
distance in representation space to the transit time from states to goals. We
propose an approach that unifies these two frameworks, using the structure of a
quasimetric representation space (triangle inequality) with the right
additional constraints to learn successor representations that enable optimal
goal-reaching. Unlike past work, our approach is able to exploit a
**quasimetric** distance parameterization to learn **optimal** goal-reaching
distances, even with **suboptimal** data and in **stochastic** environments.
This gives us the best of both worlds: we retain the stability and long-horizon
capabilities of Monte Carlo contrastive RL methods, while getting the free
stitching capabilities of quasimetric network parameterizations. On existing
offline GCRL benchmarks, our representation learning objective improves
performance on stitching tasks where methods based on contrastive learning
struggle, and on noisy, high-dimensional environments where methods based on
quasimetric networks struggle.

Abstract: Electroencephalography signals (EEGs) contain rich multi-scale information
crucial for understanding brain states, with potential applications in
diagnosing and advancing the drug development landscape. However, extracting
meaningful features from raw EEG signals while handling noise and channel
variability remains a major challenge. This work proposes a novel end-to-end
deep-learning framework that addresses these issues through several key
innovations. First, we designed an encoder capable of explicitly capturing
multi-scale frequency oscillations covering a wide range of features for
different EEG-related tasks. Secondly, to model complex dependencies and handle
the high temporal resolution of EEGs, we introduced an attention-based encoder
that simultaneously learns interactions across EEG channels and within
localized {\em patches} of individual channels. We integrated a dedicated
gating network on top of the attention encoder to dynamically filter out noisy
and non-informative channels, enhancing the reliability of EEG data. The entire
encoding process is guided by a novel loss function, which leverages supervised
and contrastive learning, significantly improving model generalization. We
validated our approach in multiple applications, ranging from the
classification of effects across multiple Central Nervous System (CNS)
disorders treatments to the diagnosis of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed learning paradigm can extract
biologically meaningful patterns from raw EEG signals across different species,
autonomously select high-quality channels, and achieve robust generalization
through innovative architectural and loss design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DARTVAE是一种结合领域特定规则和VAE的多模态聚类框架，通过将规则嵌入表示学习过程，实现更有意义和可解释的聚类结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类方法仅依赖输入数据的相似性，无法捕捉领域特定的结构或语义约束，限制了在复杂领域中的应用效果。

Method: 扩展VAE架构，嵌入显式规则、语义表示和数据驱动特征到统一潜在空间，通过损失函数中的规则一致性和违反惩罚来强制约束合规性。规则由LLM生成并构建为知识图谱。

Result: 在飞机和汽车数据集上的实验表明，规则引导聚类产生更具操作意义和可解释性的聚类结果（如分离无人机、统一隐形飞机、区分SUV和轿车），同时改进了传统聚类指标。

Conclusion: DARTVAE通过结合规则编码和学习表示，比纯数据驱动模型实现更有意义和一致的聚类结果，但面临LLM生成规则可能幻觉或冲突、规则过多导致过拟合、复杂领域扩展困难等挑战。

Abstract: Traditional clustering techniques often rely solely on similarity in the
input data, limiting their ability to capture structural or semantic
constraints that are critical in many domains. We introduce the Domain Aware
Rule Triggered Variational Autoencoder (DARTVAE), a rule guided multimodal
clustering framework that incorporates domain specific constraints directly
into the representation learning process. DARTVAE extends the VAE architecture
by embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data driven features
into a unified latent space, while enforcing constraint compliance through rule
consistency and violation penalties in the loss function. Unlike conventional
clustering methods that rely only on visual similarity or apply rules as post
hoc filters, DARTVAE treats rules as first class learning signals. The rules
are generated by LLMs, structured into knowledge graphs, and enforced through a
loss function combining reconstruction, KL divergence, consistency, and
violation penalties. Experiments on aircraft and automotive datasets
demonstrate that rule guided clustering produces more operationally meaningful
and interpretable clusters for example, isolating UAVs, unifying stealth
aircraft, or separating SUVs from sedans while improving traditional clustering
metrics. However, the framework faces challenges: LLM generated rules may
hallucinate or conflict, excessive rules risk overfitting, and scaling to
complex domains increases computational and consistency difficulties. By
combining rule encodings with learned representations, DARTVAE achieves more
meaningful and consistent clustering outcomes than purely data driven models,
highlighting the utility of constraint guided multimodal clustering for
complex, knowledge intensive settings.

TL;DR: 提出一种结合稀疏注意力和循环依赖优势的新算法，基于树结构矩阵的高效求逆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 注意力层参数依赖于输入元素的成对交互，导致内存和计算复杂度随序列长度呈二次方增长。现有方法（稀疏化或循环依赖）各有缺点，需要结合两者优势。

Method: 基于树结构矩阵的高效求逆算法，将稀疏注意力和循环依赖方法相结合。

Result: 开发出能够同时利用稀疏性和循环依赖优势的新颖算法。

Conclusion: 该算法为解决注意力机制二次复杂度问题提供了有前景的解决方案，结合了两种主要方法的优点。

Abstract: Attention layers apply a sequence-to-sequence mapping whose parameters depend
on the pairwise interactions of the input elements. However, without any
structural assumptions, memory and compute scale quadratically with the
sequence length. The two main ways to mitigate this are to introduce sparsity
by ignoring a sufficient amount of pairwise interactions or to introduce
recurrent dependence along them, as SSM does. Although both approaches are
reasonable, they both have disadvantages. We propose a novel algorithm that
combines the advantages of both concepts. Our idea is based on the efficient
inversion of tree-structured matrices.

*Daniil Shmelev,Cristopher Salvi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型稳定、近似可逆的Runge-Kutta方法（EES方案），用于解决神经SDE求解器在反向传播中的内存效率和梯度精度平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经SDE求解器的反向传播存在两难选择：离散化后优化方法内存成本高，优化后离散化方法梯度近似误差大。现有可逆求解器如Reversible Heun在复杂模型和大步长下不稳定。

Method: 设计了一类显式且有效对称（EES）的Runge-Kutta方案，这些方案保持了可逆求解器的优点，同时克服了其不稳定性。

Result: 数值实验表明，EES方案具有优越的稳定性和可靠性，能够在不受步长或模型复杂度严格限制的情况下实现内存高效训练。

Conclusion: EES方案为神经SDE的可扩展和准确训练提供了实用基础，解决了传统方法在内存效率和梯度精度之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Backpropagation through (neural) SDE solvers is traditionally approached in
two ways: discretise-then-optimise, which offers accurate gradients but incurs
prohibitive memory costs due to storing the full computational graph (even when
mitigated by checkpointing); and optimise-then-discretise, which achieves
constant memory cost by solving an auxiliary backward SDE, but suffers from
slower evaluation and gradient approximation errors. Algebraically reversible
solvers promise both memory efficiency and gradient accuracy, yet existing
methods such as the Reversible Heun scheme are often unstable under complex
models and large step sizes. We address these limitations by introducing a
novel class of stable, near-reversible Runge--Kutta schemes for neural SDEs.
These Explicit and Effectively Symmetric (EES) schemes retain the benefits of
reversible solvers while overcoming their instability, enabling
memory-efficient training without severe restrictions on step size or model
complexity. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the superior
stability and reliability of our schemes, establishing them as a practical
foundation for scalable and accurate training of neural SDEs.

Motivation: 传统全场损伤评估计算成本高昂，需要开发高效的方法来预测混凝土损伤演化，以优化配合比设计并提高耐久性。

Method: 采用自回归U-Net模型预测标量损伤场的演化，并使用CNN基于损伤估计预测关键力学性能（如收缩和残余刚度），形成双网络架构。

Result: 该方法在合成数据集上表现出高计算效率和稳健的预测性能，能够深入分析骨料特性（形状、尺寸、分布）与有效收缩和刚度降低之间的关系。

Conclusion: 该深度学习框架显著降低了传统全场损伤评估的计算负担，有助于优化混凝土配合比设计，提高耐久性并减少内部损伤。

Abstract: This paper introduces a deep learning approach for predicting time-dependent
full-field damage in concrete. The study uses an auto-regressive U-Net model to
predict the evolution of the scalar damage field in a unit cell given
microstructural geometry and evolution of an imposed shrinkage profile. By
sequentially using the predicted damage output as input for subsequent
predictions, the model facilitates the continuous assessment of damage
progression. Complementarily, a convolutional neural network (CNN) utilises the
damage estimations to forecast key mechanical properties, including observed
shrinkage and residual stiffness. The proposed dual-network architecture
demonstrates high computational efficiency and robust predictive performance on
the synthesised datasets. The approach reduces the computational load
traditionally associated with full-field damage evaluations and is used to gain
insights into the relationship between aggregate properties, such as shape,
size, and distribution, and the effective shrinkage and reduction in stiffness.
Ultimately, this can help to optimize concrete mix designs, leading to improved
durability and reduced internal damage.

Motivation: 科学机器学习在过去十年中取得了显著进展，但表示学习和算法求解方法往往平行发展，缺乏统一的数学框架。

Method: 创建潜在空间中的隐藏代理，用学习到的算子来管理数学系统，将数字孪生概念扩展到数学系统的潜在空间表示。

Conclusion: Latent Twins提供了一个紧凑、可解释的解决方案算子代理，能够跨任意时间间隔进行单次评估，并与科学流程兼容，为跨学科的数据驱动表示学习和经典科学建模提供了可扩展的理论基础代理。

Abstract: Over the past decade, scientific machine learning has transformed the
development of mathematical and computational frameworks for analyzing,
modeling, and predicting complex systems. From inverse problems to numerical
PDEs, dynamical systems, and model reduction, these advances have pushed the
boundaries of what can be simulated. Yet they have often progressed in
parallel, with representation learning and algorithmic solution methods
evolving largely as separate pipelines. With \emph{Latent Twins}, we propose a
unifying mathematical framework that creates a hidden surrogate in latent space
for the underlying equations. Whereas digital twins mirror physical systems in
the digital world, Latent Twins mirror mathematical systems in a learned latent
space governed by operators. Through this lens, classical modeling, inversion,
model reduction, and operator approximation all emerge as special cases of a
single principle. We establish the fundamental approximation properties of
Latent Twins for both ODEs and PDEs and demonstrate the framework across three
representative settings: (i) canonical ODEs, capturing diverse dynamical
regimes; (ii) a PDE benchmark using the shallow-water equations, contrasting
Latent Twin simulations with DeepONet and forecasts with a 4D-Var baseline; and
(iii) a challenging real-data geopotential reanalysis dataset, reconstructing
and forecasting from sparse, noisy observations. Latent Twins provide a
compact, interpretable surrogate for solution operators that evaluate across
arbitrary time gaps in a single-shot, while remaining compatible with
scientific pipelines such as assimilation, control, and uncertainty
quantification. Looking forward, this framework offers scalable,
theory-grounded surrogates that bridge data-driven representation learning and
classical scientific modeling across disciplines.

TL;DR: 本文提出用复杂度奖励替代熵奖励，通过结合香农熵和离均衡度来平衡随机性和结构化，从而改进策略梯度方法的探索效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的熵最大化方法将策略推向均匀随机分布，这种探索策略缺乏结构且效率低下。作者希望设计一个更鲁棒的复杂度奖励来鼓励策略在随机性和结构化之间取得平衡。

Method: 提出复杂度驱动策略优化（CDPO）算法，用复杂度奖励替代PPO中的熵奖励。复杂度定义为香农熵和离均衡度的乘积，离均衡度量化了与均匀分布的距离。

Result: 在多个离散动作空间任务上的实验表明，CDPO对复杂度系数的选择比PPO对熵系数的选择更加鲁棒，特别是在需要更多探索的环境中表现更好。

Conclusion: 复杂度奖励能够有效平衡探索和利用，鼓励智能体发现结构化但适应性强的策略，比传统的熵奖励方法更加鲁棒和有效。

Abstract: Policy gradient methods often balance exploitation and exploration via
entropy maximization. However, maximizing entropy pushes the policy towards a
uniform random distribution, which represents an unstructured and sometimes
inefficient exploration strategy. In this work, we propose replacing the
entropy bonus with a more robust complexity bonus. In particular, we adopt a
measure of complexity, defined as the product of Shannon entropy and
disequilibrium, where the latter quantifies the distance from the uniform
distribution. This regularizer encourages policies that balance stochasticity
(high entropy) with structure (high disequilibrium), guiding agents toward
regimes where useful, non-trivial behaviors can emerge. Such behaviors arise
because the regularizer suppresses both extremes, e.g., maximal disorder and
complete order, creating pressure for agents to discover structured yet
adaptable strategies. Starting from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we
introduce Complexity-Driven Policy Optimization (CDPO), a new learning
algorithm that replaces entropy with complexity. We show empirically across a
range of discrete action space tasks that CDPO is more robust to the choice of
the complexity coefficient than PPO is with the entropy coefficient, especially
in environments requiring greater exploration.

Motivation: 恢复高维信号是逆问题的核心挑战，虽然生成扩散模型在提供数据驱动先验方面取得了显著经验成功，但严格的恢复保证仍然有限。

Method: 开发理论框架分析确定性扩散算法，将噪声卷积分数解释为时变投影，将扩散先验算法解释为广义投影梯度下降方法，并在受限等距性质条件下分析收敛性。

Result: 当感知矩阵在模型集上满足受限等距性质时，可以推导出显式依赖于噪声调度的定量收敛速率。在低维紧凸集和低秩高斯混合模型等数据分布上验证了框架有效性。

Conclusion: 该理论框架为扩散模型在逆问题中的应用提供了严格的理论基础，即使在非凸模型集上也能建立全局收敛保证。

Abstract: Recovering high-dimensional signals from corrupted measurements is a central
challenge in inverse problems. Recent advances in generative diffusion models
have shown remarkable empirical success in providing strong data-driven priors,
but rigorous recovery guarantees remain limited. In this work, we develop a
theoretical framework for analyzing deterministic diffusion-based algorithms
for inverse problems, focusing on a deterministic version of the algorithm
proposed by Kadkhodaie \& Simoncelli \cite{kadkhodaie2021stochastic}. First, we
show that when the underlying data distribution concentrates on a
low-dimensional model set, the associated noise-convolved scores can be
interpreted as time-varying projections onto such a set. This leads to
interpreting previous algorithms using diffusion priors for inverse problems as
generalized projected gradient descent methods with varying projections. When
the sensing matrix satisfies a restricted isometry property over the model set,
we can derive quantitative convergence rates that depend explicitly on the
noise schedule. We apply our framework to two instructive data distributions:
uniform distributions over low-dimensional compact, convex sets and low-rank
Gaussian mixture models. In the latter setting, we can establish global
convergence guarantees despite the nonconvexity of the underlying model set.

Method: 开发MDBench基准测试框架，评估12种算法在14个PDE和63个ODE上的表现，考虑不同噪声水平，使用导数预测精度、模型复杂度和方程保真度等指标。

Result: 线性方法和遗传编程方法分别在PDE和ODE上获得最低预测误差，线性模型对噪声更鲁棒。同时发现了当前方法在流体动力学和热力学PDE系统上的关键局限性。

Conclusion: MDBench通过提供严格的、可扩展的基准测试框架和丰富的动态系统数据集，加速了模型发现方法的发展，支持系统性的评估、比较和改进。

Abstract: Model discovery aims to uncover governing differential equations of dynamical
systems directly from experimental data. Benchmarking such methods is essential
for tracking progress and understanding trade-offs in the field. While prior
efforts have focused mostly on identifying single equations, typically framed
as symbolic regression, there remains a lack of comprehensive benchmarks for
discovering dynamical models. To address this, we introduce MDBench, an
open-source benchmarking framework for evaluating model discovery methods on
dynamical systems. MDBench assesses 12 algorithms on 14 partial differential
equations (PDEs) and 63 ordinary differential equations (ODEs) under varying
levels of noise. Evaluation metrics include derivative prediction accuracy,
model complexity, and equation fidelity. We also introduce seven challenging
PDE systems from fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, revealing key limitations
in current methods. Our findings illustrate that linear methods and genetic
programming methods achieve the lowest prediction error for PDEs and ODEs,
respectively. Moreover, linear models are in general more robust against noise.
MDBench accelerates the advancement of model discovery methods by offering a
rigorous, extensible benchmarking framework and a rich, diverse collection of
dynamical system datasets, enabling systematic evaluation, comparison, and
improvement of equation accuracy and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NPC模型虽然具有可解释性和高性能，但其基于神经网络的属性识别模块容易受到对抗攻击的影响，可能危及最终预测结果。

Method: 提出RNPC模型，采用新颖的类间集成推理方法，确保两个模块输出的鲁棒组合。理论分析证明RNPC比NPC具有更好的对抗鲁棒性。

Result: 在图像分类任务上的实证结果表明，RNPC相比现有概念瓶颈模型具有更优的对抗鲁棒性，同时在良性输入上保持高准确率。

Conclusion: RNPC是第一个针对识别模块对抗攻击的鲁棒神经概率电路，通过理论分析和实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Neural Probabilistic Circuits (NPCs), a new class of concept bottleneck
models, comprise an attribute recognition model and a probabilistic circuit for
reasoning. By integrating the outputs from these two modules, NPCs produce
compositional and interpretable predictions. While offering enhanced
interpretability and high performance on downstream tasks, the
neural-network-based attribute recognition model remains a black box. This
vulnerability allows adversarial attacks to manipulate attribute predictions by
introducing carefully crafted subtle perturbations to input images, potentially
compromising the final predictions. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the
adversarial robustness of NPC and demonstrate that it only depends on the
robustness of the attribute recognition model and is independent of the
robustness of the probabilistic circuit. Moreover, we propose RNPC, the first
robust neural probabilistic circuit against adversarial attacks on the
recognition module. RNPC introduces a novel class-wise integration for
inference, ensuring a robust combination of outputs from the two modules. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that RNPC exhibits provably improved
adversarial robustness compared to NPC. Empirical results on image
classification tasks show that RNPC achieves superior adversarial robustness
compared to existing concept bottleneck models while maintaining high accuracy
on benign inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病影响全球超过5.37亿人，预计到2045年将达到7.83亿。早期风险分层可以从机器学习中受益，需要评估不同混合分类器的泛化性能。

Method: 构建了两种混合分类器：XGBoost+随机森林和SVM+逻辑回归。采用防泄漏的标准化流程，包括编码、插补、归一化处理，仅在训练折叠上使用SMOTE，并对SVM进行概率校准。在主要数据集上训练后冻结流程，在PIMA外部队列上进行验证。

Result: 在主要数据集上，XGB-RF（AUROC ~0.995，AUPRC ~0.998）显著优于SVM-LR（AUROC ~0.978，AUPRC ~0.947）。在PIMA外部验证集上，XGB-RF保持强劲性能（AUROC ~0.990，AUPRC ~0.959），而SVM-LR性能较低（AUROC ~0.963，AUPRC ~0.875）。

Conclusion: XGB-RF在内部和外部队列中始终优于SVM-LR，表现出更小的外部性能衰减和可接受的校准度。基于梯度提升的混合方法是一种稳健、可转移的糖尿病风险分层策略，支持进行前瞻性多中心验证。

Abstract: Background/Purpose: Diabetes affects over 537 million people worldwide and is
projected to reach 783 million by 2045. Early risk stratification can benefit
from machine learning. We compare two hybrid classifiers and assess their
generalizability on an external cohort.
  Methods: Two hybrids were built: (i) XGBoost + Random Forest (XGB-RF) and
(ii) Support Vector Machine + Logistic Regression (SVM-LR). A leakage-safe,
standardized pipeline (encoding, imputation, min-max scaling; SMOTE on training
folds only; probability calibration for SVM) was fit on the primary dataset and
frozen. Evaluation prioritized threshold-independent discrimination
(AUROC/AUPRC) and calibration (Brier, slope/intercept). External validation
used the PIMA cohort (N=768) with the frozen pipeline; any thresholded metrics
on PIMA were computed at the default rule tau = 0.5.
  Results: On the primary dataset (PR baseline = 0.50), XGB-RF achieved AUROC
~0.995 and AUPRC ~0.998, outperforming SVM-LR (AUROC ~0.978; AUPRC ~0.947). On
PIMA (PR baseline ~0.349), XGB-RF retained strong performance (AUROC ~0.990;
AUPRC ~0.959); SVM-LR was lower (AUROC ~0.963; AUPRC ~0.875). Thresholded
metrics on PIMA at tau = 0.5 were XGB-RF (Accuracy 0.960; Precision 0.941;
Recall 0.944; F1 0.942) and SVM-LR (Accuracy 0.900; Precision 0.855; Recall
0.858; F1 0.857).
  Conclusions: Across internal and external cohorts, XGB-RF consistently
dominated SVM-LR and exhibited smaller external attenuation on ROC/PR with
acceptable calibration. These results support gradient-boosting-based
hybridization as a robust, transferable approach for diabetes risk
stratification and motivate prospective, multi-site validation with
deployment-time threshold selection based on clinical trade-offs.

Conclusion: 奖励微调方法在推进科学生成建模方面具有巨大潜力，PIRF为物理约束生成提供了新视角。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong generative capabilities across
scientific domains, but often produce outputs that violate physical laws. We
propose a new perspective by framing physics-informed generation as a sparse
reward optimization problem, where adherence to physical constraints is treated
as a reward signal. This formulation unifies prior approaches under a
reward-based paradigm and reveals a shared bottleneck: reliance on diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS)-style value function approximations, which introduce
non-negligible errors and lead to training instability and inference
inefficiency. To overcome this, we introduce Physics-Informed Reward
Fine-tuning (PIRF), a method that bypasses value approximation by computing
trajectory-level rewards and backpropagating their gradients directly. However,
a naive implementation suffers from low sample efficiency and compromised data
fidelity. PIRF mitigates these issues through two key strategies: (1) a
layer-wise truncated backpropagation method that leverages the spatiotemporally
localized nature of physics-based rewards, and (2) a weight-based
regularization scheme that improves efficiency over traditional
distillation-based methods. Across five PDE benchmarks, PIRF consistently
achieves superior physical enforcement under efficient sampling regimes,
highlighting the potential of reward fine-tuning for advancing scientific
generative modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯神经网络虽然能提供预测不确定性量化，但在实践中难以获得准确的不确定性量化，部分原因是训练过程中的近似方法和超参数选择的复杂性。超参数数量多且对结果影响不透明，限制了BNNs的实际应用。

Method: 采用全局敏感性分析方法，在不同超参数设置下评估BNNs的性能表现，分析超参数之间的相互作用及其对预测准确性和不确定性量化的影响。

Result: 研究发现许多超参数之间存在相互作用，共同影响预测准确性和不确定性量化。超参数的选择对BNNs性能有显著影响。

Conclusion: 建议在实际应用中使用全局敏感性分析或贝叶斯优化等方法来辅助超参数的维度缩减和选择，以确保BNNs能够提供准确的不确定性量化。

Abstract: In scientific applications, predictive modeling is often of limited use
without accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) to indicate when a model may
be extrapolating or when more data needs to be collected. Bayesian Neural
Networks (BNNs) produce predictive uncertainty by propagating uncertainty in
neural network (NN) weights and offer the promise of obtaining not only an
accurate predictive model but also accurate UQ. However, in practice, obtaining
accurate UQ with BNNs is difficult due in part to the approximations used for
practical model training and in part to the need to choose a suitable set of
hyperparameters; these hyperparameters outnumber those needed for traditional
NNs and often have opaque effects on the results. We aim to shed light on the
effects of hyperparameter choices for BNNs by performing a global sensitivity
analysis of BNN performance under varying hyperparameter settings. Our results
indicate that many of the hyperparameters interact with each other to affect
both predictive accuracy and UQ. For improved usage of BNNs in real-world
applications, we suggest that global sensitivity analysis, or related methods
such as Bayesian optimization, should be used to aid in dimensionality
reduction and selection of hyperparameters to ensure accurate UQ in BNNs.

Abstract: The Fast Multipole Method (FMM) is an efficient numerical algorithm for
computation of long-ranged forces in $N$-body problems within gravitational and
electrostatic fields. This method utilizes multipole expansions of the Green's
function inherent to the underlying dynamical systems. Despite its widespread
application in physics and engineering, the integration of FMM with modern
machine learning architectures remains underexplored. In this work, we propose
a novel neural network architecture, the Neural FMM, that integrates the
information flow of the FMM into a hierarchical machine learning framework for
learning the Green's operator of an Elliptic PDE. Our Neural FMM architecture
leverages a hierarchical computation flow of the FMM method to split up the
local and far-field interactions and efficiently learn their respective
representations.

Abstract: Quality of Experience (QoE) modeling is crucial for optimizing video
streaming services to capture the complex relationships between different
features and user experience. We propose a novel approach to QoE modeling in
video streaming applications using interpretable Machine Learning (ML)
techniques over raw time series data. Unlike traditional black-box approaches,
our method combines Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as an interpretable
readout on top of compact frequency-domain features, allowing us to capture
temporal information while retaining a transparent and explainable model. We
evaluate our method on popular datasets and demonstrate its enhanced accuracy
in QoE prediction, while offering transparency and interpretability.

Abstract: Function encoders are a recent technique that learn neural network basis
functions to form compact, adaptive representations of Hilbert spaces of
functions. We show that function encoders provide a principled connection to
feature learning and kernel methods by defining a kernel through an inner
product of the learned feature map. This kernel-theoretic perspective explains
their ability to scale independently of dataset size while adapting to the
intrinsic structure of data, and it enables kernel-style analysis of neural
models. Building on this foundation, we develop two training algorithms that
learn compact bases: a progressive training approach that constructively grows
bases, and a train-then-prune approach that offers a computationally efficient
alternative after training. Both approaches use principles from PCA to reveal
the intrinsic dimension of the learned space. In parallel, we derive
finite-sample generalization bounds using Rademacher complexity and PAC-Bayes
techniques, providing inference time guarantees. We validate our approach on a
polynomial benchmark with a known intrinsic dimension, and on nonlinear
dynamical systems including a Van der Pol oscillator and a two-body orbital
model, demonstrating that the same accuracy can be achieved with substantially
fewer basis functions. This work suggests a path toward neural predictors with
kernel-level guarantees, enabling adaptable models that are both efficient and
principled at scale.

Motivation: 互信息是衡量随机变量关系的重要指标，但复杂系统中的互信息估计具有挑战性。去噪扩散模型在密度估计方面表现出色，因此探索其是否也能改进互信息估计。

Method: 利用去噪扩散模型的信息论公式，将互信息表示为条件与无条件扩散的最小均方误差差异的一半，在所有信噪比上进行积分，并采用自适应重要性采样实现可扩展的估计。

Result: 该方法通过了自一致性测试，在性能上超越了传统和基于分数的扩散互信息估计器，即使在高互信息情况下也能保持强劲表现。

Conclusion: 扩散模型为互信息估计提供了一种直接有效的方法，通过自适应重要性采样实现了可扩展且稳健的估计性能。

Abstract: Mutual information (MI) is one of the most general ways to measure
relationships between random variables, but estimating this quantity for
complex systems is challenging. Denoising diffusion models have recently set a
new bar for density estimation, so it is natural to consider whether these
methods could also be used to improve MI estimation. Using the recently
introduced information-theoretic formulation of denoising diffusion models, we
show the diffusion models can be used in a straightforward way to estimate MI.
In particular, the MI corresponds to half the gap in the Minimum Mean Square
Error (MMSE) between conditional and unconditional diffusion, integrated over
all Signal-to-Noise-Ratios (SNRs) in the noising process. Our approach not only
passes self-consistency tests but also outperforms traditional and score-based
diffusion MI estimators. Furthermore, our method leverages adaptive importance
sampling to achieve scalable MI estimation, while maintaining strong
performance even when the MI is high.

Conclusion: SIL-C框架有效解决了技能增量学习中的兼容性问题，为构建可重用和可扩展的分层策略提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Skill Incremental Learning (SIL) is the process by which an embodied agent
expands and refines its skill set over time by leveraging experience gained
through interaction with its environment or by the integration of additional
data. SIL facilitates efficient acquisition of hierarchical policies grounded
in reusable skills for downstream tasks. However, as the skill repertoire
evolves, it can disrupt compatibility with existing skill-based policies,
limiting their reusability and generalization. In this work, we propose SIL-C,
a novel framework that ensures skill-policy compatibility, allowing
improvements in incrementally learned skills to enhance the performance of
downstream policies without requiring policy re-training or structural
adaptation. SIL-C employs a bilateral lazy learning-based mapping technique to
dynamically align the subtask space referenced by policies with the skill space
decoded into agent behaviors. This enables each subtask, derived from the
policy's decomposition of a complex task, to be executed by selecting an
appropriate skill based on trajectory distribution similarity. We evaluate
SIL-C across diverse SIL scenarios and demonstrate that it maintains
compatibility between evolving skills and downstream policies while ensuring
efficiency throughout the learning process.

Motivation: 训练LLM代理进行复杂多轮任务规划面临稀疏奖励、长视野信用分配和强化学习计算开销等挑战，需要更高效的优化方法。

Method: 将多轮任务规划转化为单轮任务推理问题，使用GRPO方法利用专家轨迹的密集可验证奖励进行策略优化。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
knowledge acquisition, reasoning, and tool use, making them promising
candidates for autonomous agent applications. However, training LLM agents for
complex multi-turn task planning faces significant challenges, including sparse
episode-wise rewards, credit assignment across long horizons, and the
computational overhead of reinforcement learning in multi-turn interaction
settings. To this end, this paper introduces a novel approach that transforms
multi-turn task planning into single-turn task reasoning problems, enabling
efficient policy optimization through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
with dense and verifiable reward from expert trajectories. Our theoretical
analysis shows that GRPO improvement on single-turn task reasoning results in
higher multi-turn success probability under the minimal turns, as well as the
generalization to subtasks with shorter horizons. Experimental evaluation on
the complex task planning benchmark demonstrates that our 1.5B parameter model
trained with single-turn GRPO achieves superior performance compared to larger
baseline models up to 14B parameters, with success rates of 70% for
long-horizon planning tasks with over 30 steps. We also theoretically and
empirically validate the strong cross-task generalizability that the models
trained on complex tasks can lead to the successful completion of all simpler
subtasks.

Motivation: 多站点功能磁共振成像研究中，数据隐私约束和站点特异性异质性导致非独立同分布数据，阻碍了通用模型的开发。

Method: PFedDL在每个站点执行独立的字典学习，将站点特定字典分解为共享全局组件和个性化本地组件，通过联邦聚合更新全局原子以促进跨站点一致性，同时独立优化本地原子以捕捉站点特异性变异。

Result: 在ABIDE数据集上的实验表明，PFedDL在非独立同分布数据集上的准确性和鲁棒性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PFedDL框架有效解决了多站点神经影像分析中的数据隐私和异质性挑战，为联邦学习在医疗影像分析中的应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Data privacy constraints pose significant challenges for large-scale
neuroimaging analysis, especially in multi-site functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) studies, where site-specific heterogeneity leads to
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. These factors
hinder the development of generalizable models. To address these challenges, we
propose Personalized Federated Dictionary Learning (PFedDL), a novel federated
learning framework that enables collaborative modeling across sites without
sharing raw data. PFedDL performs independent dictionary learning at each site,
decomposing each site-specific dictionary into a shared global component and a
personalized local component. The global atoms are updated via federated
aggregation to promote cross-site consistency, while the local atoms are
refined independently to capture site-specific variability, thereby enhancing
downstream analysis. Experiments on the ABIDE dataset demonstrate that PFedDL
outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness across non-IID
datasets.

Motivation: 音频大语言模型能够进行类似人类的音乐对话，但尚不清楚它们是否真正在听音频还是主要依赖文本推理。

Method: 采用MM-SHAP框架（基于Shapley值的性能无关评分）来量化每个模态对模型预测的相对贡献，并在MuChoMusic基准上评估两个模型。

Result: 发现准确率更高的模型更依赖文本来回答问题，但进一步检查显示即使音频整体贡献较低，模型仍能成功定位关键声音事件，表明音频并未被完全忽略。

Conclusion: 这是MM-SHAP在音频大语言模型中的首次应用，为可解释AI和音频研究的未来发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (Audio LLMs) enable human-like conversation about
music, yet it is unclear if they are truly listening to the audio or just using
textual reasoning, as recent benchmarks suggest. This paper investigates this
issue by quantifying the contribution of each modality to a model's output. We
adapt the MM-SHAP framework, a performance-agnostic score based on Shapley
values that quantifies the relative contribution of each modality to a model's
prediction. We evaluate two models on the MuChoMusic benchmark and find that
the model with higher accuracy relies more on text to answer questions, but
further inspection shows that even if the overall audio contribution is low,
models can successfully localize key sound events, suggesting that audio is not
entirely ignored. Our study is the first application of MM-SHAP to Audio LLMs
and we hope it will serve as a foundational step for future research in
explainable AI and audio.

Motivation: 现有好奇心机制在去中心化、无通信的多智能体强化学习环境中存在两个问题：1）将环境随机性误认为有意义的新颖性；2）忽视同伴行为新颖性所编码的潜在任务动态，导致次优探索

Method: 受人类儿童通过观察同伴自适应校准探索行为的启发，提出CERMIC框架：1）鲁棒过滤噪声惊喜信号；2）动态校准内在好奇心与推断的多智能体上下文；3）生成理论支撑的内在奖励，鼓励探索具有高信息增益的状态转移

Result: 在VMAS、Meltingpot和SMACv2等基准测试套件上的实证结果表明，CERMIC在稀疏奖励环境中的探索性能显著优于最先进算法

Conclusion: CERMIC通过有效利用多智能体上下文信息和理论支撑的内在奖励机制，成功解决了多智能体强化学习中探索效率低下的问题，为复杂环境下的自主探索提供了新思路

Abstract: Autonomous exploration in complex multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
with sparse rewards critically depends on providing agents with effective
intrinsic motivation. While artificial curiosity offers a powerful
self-supervised signal, it often confuses environmental stochasticity with
meaningful novelty. Moreover, existing curiosity mechanisms exhibit a uniform
novelty bias, treating all unexpected observations equally. However, peer
behavior novelty, which encode latent task dynamics, are often overlooked,
resulting in suboptimal exploration in decentralized, communication-free MARL
settings. To this end, inspired by how human children adaptively calibrate
their own exploratory behaviors via observing peers, we propose a novel
approach to enhance multi-agent exploration. We introduce CERMIC, a principled
framework that empowers agents to robustly filter noisy surprise signals and
guide exploration by dynamically calibrating their intrinsic curiosity with
inferred multi-agent context. Additionally, CERMIC generates
theoretically-grounded intrinsic rewards, encouraging agents to explore state
transitions with high information gain. We evaluate CERMIC on benchmark suites
including VMAS, Meltingpot, and SMACv2. Empirical results demonstrate that
exploration with CERMIC significantly outperforms SoTA algorithms in
sparse-reward environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决用户在超级计算机上运行昂贵化学计算（如耦合簇方法）时面临的两个关键问题：最短时间配置和最低成本配置，避免资源浪费。

Method: 使用梯度提升（GB）机器学习模型和主动学习策略，基于CCSD应用在DOE Frontier和Aurora超级计算机上的运行参数数据进行预测。

Result: 在预测CCSD迭代总执行时间时，GB模型在Aurora和Frontier上的平均绝对百分比误差分别为0.023和0.073；主动学习策略仅需约450个实验数据即可达到约0.2的MAPE。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法能够有效预测化学计算资源需求，主动学习策略在数据收集成本高的情况下尤为实用，为超级计算机用户提供了可靠的资源配置指导。

Abstract: In this work, we develop machine learning (ML) based strategies to predict
resources (costs) required for massively parallel chemistry computations, such
as coupled-cluster methods, to guide application users before they commit to
running expensive experiments on a supercomputer. By predicting application
execution time, we determine the optimal runtime parameter values such as
number of nodes and tile sizes. Two key questions of interest to users are
addressed. The first is the shortest-time question, where the user is
interested in knowing the parameter configurations (number of nodes and tile
sizes) to achieve the shortest execution time for a given problem size and a
target supercomputer. The second is the cheapest-run question in which the user
is interested in minimizing resource usage, i.e., finding the number of nodes
and tile size that minimizes the number of node-hours for a given problem size.
  We evaluate a rich family of ML models and strategies, developed based on the
collections of runtime parameter values for the CCSD (Coupled Cluster with
Singles and Doubles) application executed on the Department of Energy (DOE)
Frontier and Aurora supercomputers. Our experiments show that when predicting
the total execution time of a CCSD iteration, a Gradient Boosting (GB) ML model
achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.023 and 0.073 for Aurora
and Frontier, respectively. In the case where it is expensive to run
experiments just to collect data points, we show that active learning can
achieve a MAPE of about 0.2 with just around 450 experiments collected from
Aurora and Frontier.

Result: 实验显示预测阈值与经验拐点高度一致，理论作为保守可靠上界，校准版本进一步缩小差距

Conclusion: 研究将谱覆盖与稳定ICL联系起来，连接理论与部署，提高大规模提示在有限样本下的可解释性和可靠性

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is flexible but its reliability is highly sensitive
to prompt length. This paper establishes a non-asymptotic lower bound that
links the minimal number of demonstrations to ICL stability under fixed
high-dimensional sub-Gaussian representations. The bound gives explicit
sufficient conditions in terms of spectral properties of the covariance,
providing a computable criterion for practice. Building on this analysis, we
propose a two-stage observable estimator with a one-shot calibration that
produces practitioner-ready prompt-length estimates without distributional
priors. Experiments across diverse datasets, encoders, and generators show
close alignment between the predicted thresholds and empirical knee-points,
with the theory acting as a conservative but reliable upper bound; the
calibrated variant further tightens this gap. These results connect spectral
coverage to stable ICL, bridge theory and deployment, and improve the
interpretability and reliability of large-scale prompting in realistic
finite-sample regimes.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Bispectral Optimal Transport（双谱最优传输），这是一种对称感知的离散最优传输扩展方法，通过使用双谱表示来比较元素，能够在保持信号结构的同时去除群作用带来的变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在对称性丰富的场景中，仅基于原始特征之间几何距离的最优传输对齐可能会忽略数据的内在相干结构。传统OT方法无法有效处理由视觉对称性变换引起的变化。

Method: 引入双谱最优传输，使用双谱（一种群傅里叶不变量）来表示元素，该不变量在去除群作用变化的同时保留所有信号结构。通过双谱表示来计算传输计划。

Result: 在经视觉对称性变换的基准数据集上，Bispectral OT计算的传输计划比原始特征OT实现了更高的类别保持准确率，改善了有意义的对应关系的质量。

Conclusion: Bispectral OT能够捕获数据集中底层语义标签结构的有意义对应关系，同时去除不影响类别或内容的干扰变化，优于传统的最优传输方法。

Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) is a widely used technique in machine learning,
graphics, and vision that aligns two distributions or datasets using their
relative geometry. In symmetry-rich settings, however, OT alignments based
solely on pairwise geometric distances between raw features can ignore the
intrinsic coherence structure of the data. We introduce Bispectral Optimal
Transport, a symmetry-aware extension of discrete OT that compares elements
using their representation using the bispectrum, a group Fourier invariant that
preserves all signal structure while removing only the variation due to group
actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that the transport plans computed with
Bispectral OT achieve greater class preservation accuracy than naive feature OT
on benchmark datasets transformed with visual symmetries, improving the quality
of meaningful correspondences that capture the underlying semantic label
structure in the dataset while removing nuisance variation not affecting class
or content.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现联邦学习框架下的大语言模型微调仍然存在隐私泄露风险，攻击者可以从全局模型中提取训练数据，且模型规模越大泄露风险越高。作者还提出了一种针对FL的增强攻击策略，并评估了多种隐私保护技术的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然联邦学习被认为是保护隐私的协作训练框架，但现有研究假设全局模型只包含泛化知识而不会泄露客户隐私。本文旨在验证这一假设是否成立，并探索FL环境下LLM微调的实际隐私风险。

Method: 通过大量实验验证FL框架下LLM微调的隐私泄露问题，包括使用简单的生成方法从全局模型中提取训练数据，并提出一种跟踪全局模型更新的增强攻击策略。同时评估了差分隐私、正则化约束更新和安全对齐LLM等隐私保护技术。

Result: 实验表明攻击者确实可以从FL训练的全局模型中提取训练数据，隐私泄露程度随模型规模增大而增加。提出的增强攻击策略进一步加剧了隐私泄露风险。评估的隐私保护技术在一定程度上能降低风险，但需要权衡隐私保护与模型性能。

Conclusion: 联邦学习框架下的LLM微调并非绝对安全，存在显著的隐私泄露风险。组织在使用FL进行协作训练时需要采取额外的隐私保护措施，并需要在实际应用中平衡隐私保护与模型效用。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with local data is a widely adopted
approach for organizations seeking to adapt LLMs to their specific domains.
Given the shared characteristics in data across different organizations, the
idea of collaboratively fine-tuning an LLM using data from multiple sources
presents an appealing opportunity. However, organizations are often reluctant
to share local data, making centralized fine-tuning impractical. Federated
learning (FL), a privacy-preserving framework, enables clients to retain local
data while sharing only model parameters for collaborative training, offering a
potential solution. While fine-tuning LLMs on centralized datasets risks data
leakage through next-token prediction, the iterative aggregation process in FL
results in a global model that encapsulates generalized knowledge, which some
believe protects client privacy. In this paper, however, we present
contradictory findings through extensive experiments. We show that attackers
can still extract training data from the global model, even using
straightforward generation methods, with leakage increasing as the model size
grows. Moreover, we introduce an enhanced attack strategy tailored to FL, which
tracks global model updates during training to intensify privacy leakage. To
mitigate these risks, we evaluate privacy-preserving techniques in FL,
including differential privacy, regularization-constrained updates and adopting
LLMs with safety alignment. Our results provide valuable insights and practical
guidelines for reducing privacy risks when training LLMs with FL.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug-target binding affinity can accelerate drug
discovery by prioritizing promising compounds before costly wet-lab screening.
While deep learning has advanced this task, most models fuse ligand and protein
representations via simple concatenation and lack explicit geometric
regularization, resulting in poor generalization across chemical space and
time. We introduce FIRM-DTI, a lightweight framework that conditions molecular
embeddings on protein embeddings through a feature-wise linear modulation
(FiLM) layer and enforces metric structure with a triplet loss. An RBF
regression head operating on embedding distances yields smooth, interpretable
affinity predictions. Despite its modest size, FIRM-DTI achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Therapeutics Data Commons DTI-DG benchmark,
as demonstrated by an extensive ablation study and out-of-domain evaluation.
Our results underscore the value of conditioning and metric learning for robust
drug-target affinity prediction.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing
large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core
challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the
balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods,
such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable
gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We
systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped
tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We
propose \textbf{C}ontrolling \textbf{E}ntropy via
\textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization
(CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in
native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of
gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve
an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and
empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy
instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show
that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model
scales.

Motivation: 受遗传算法有效性和分子设计中可合成性重要性的启发，开发直接在合成路线上操作的遗传算法，确保生成的分子具有可合成性。

Method: 使用定制交叉和变异操作约束算法在可合成分子空间内操作，通过修改适应度函数适应不同设计任务，结合机器学习过滤器优化构建块集，并开发SynGBO将SynGA集成到贝叶斯优化内循环中。

Conclusion: SynGA作为轻量级且内置可合成性约束的算法，既可作为强大的独立基准，也可作为未来合成感知工作流程中的多功能模块。

Abstract: Inspired by the effectiveness of genetic algorithms and the importance of
synthesizability in molecular design, we present SynGA, a simple genetic
algorithm that operates directly over synthesis routes. Our method features
custom crossover and mutation operators that explicitly constrain it to
synthesizable molecular space. By modifying the fitness function, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of SynGA on a variety of design tasks, including
synthesizable analog search and sample-efficient property optimization, for
both 2D and 3D objectives. Furthermore, by coupling SynGA with a machine
learning-based filter that focuses the building block set, we boost SynGA to
state-of-the-art performance. For property optimization, this manifests as a
model-based variant SynGBO, which employs SynGA and block filtering in the
inner loop of Bayesian optimization. Since SynGA is lightweight and enforces
synthesizability by construction, our hope is that SynGA can not only serve as
a strong standalone baseline but also as a versatile module that can be
incorporated into larger synthesis-aware workflows in the future.

*Yuda Bi,Vince D Calhoun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过核回归分析，揭示了深度学习中缩放定律的数学起源，证明缩放指数取决于数据冗余度而非普遍常数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习中的缩放定律表现出模型性能随数据集和模型规模呈幂律增长的特征，但其数学起源特别是缩放指数的决定因素一直不明确。

Method: 使用核回归方法，分析数据协方差谱的多项式尾部特性，推导出超额风险的幂律表达式，并在有界可逆变换、多模态混合、有限宽度近似和Transformer架构等多种场景下验证该定律的普适性。

Result: 发现缩放指数α=2s/(2s+1/β)，其中β控制谱尾部特性，1/β衡量数据冗余度，表明学习曲线的斜率取决于数据冗余度而非固定值。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次为缩放定律提供了严格的数学解释，将其视为有限样本冗余定律，统一了经验观察与理论基础。

Abstract: Scaling laws, a defining feature of deep learning, reveal a striking
power-law improvement in model performance with increasing dataset and model
size. Yet, their mathematical origins, especially the scaling exponent, have
remained elusive. In this work, we show that scaling laws can be formally
explained as redundancy laws. Using kernel regression, we show that a
polynomial tail in the data covariance spectrum yields an excess risk power law
with exponent alpha = 2s / (2s + 1/beta), where beta controls the spectral tail
and 1/beta measures redundancy. This reveals that the learning curve's slope is
not universal but depends on data redundancy, with steeper spectra accelerating
returns to scale. We establish the law's universality across boundedly
invertible transformations, multi-modal mixtures, finite-width approximations,
and Transformer architectures in both linearized (NTK) and feature-learning
regimes. This work delivers the first rigorous mathematical explanation of
scaling laws as finite-sample redundancy laws, unifying empirical observations
with theoretical foundations.

TL;DR: 本文首次研究音频水印对反欺骗系统的影响，发现水印会降低反欺骗性能，并提出KPWL框架来缓解这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频水印技术广泛用于版权保护，但其对反欺骗系统的影响尚未被研究。反欺骗系统对语音应用安全至关重要，需要了解水印带来的潜在影响。

Method: 构建Watermark-Spoofing数据集，应用多种手工和神经网络水印方法到现有反欺骗数据集。提出KPWL框架，使模型能适应水印引起的域偏移同时保持原始域检测能力。

Result: 实验表明水印会持续降低反欺骗性能，水印密度越高，等错误率(EER)越高。KPWL框架能有效缓解水印带来的性能下降。

Conclusion: 音频水印是一个被忽视的域偏移因素，本研究为开发抗水印反欺骗系统建立了首个基准，相关协议已开源。

Abstract: This paper presents the first study on the impact of audio watermarking on
spoofing countermeasures. While anti-spoofing systems are essential for
securing speech-based applications, the influence of widely used audio
watermarking, originally designed for copyright protection, remains largely
unexplored. We construct watermark-augmented training and evaluation datasets,
named the Watermark-Spoofing dataset, by applying diverse handcrafted and
neural watermarking methods to existing anti-spoofing datasets. Experiments
show that watermarking consistently degrades anti-spoofing performance, with
higher watermark density correlating with higher Equal Error Rates (EERs). To
mitigate this, we propose the Knowledge-Preserving Watermark Learning (KPWL)
framework, enabling models to adapt to watermark-induced shifts while
preserving their original-domain spoofing detection capability. These findings
reveal audio watermarking as a previously overlooked domain shift and establish
the first benchmark for developing watermark-resilient anti-spoofing systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文对Transformer-based表格数据合成工具进行敏感性评估，分析超参数选择对合成数据质量和计算性能的影响，比较GReaT和REaLTabFormer两种工具在不同数据集上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based模型在表格数据合成质量上优于GANs和Diffusion模型，但计算成本高，需要研究如何通过超参数调优在保持数据质量的同时降低计算需求。

Method: 在两个工具GReaT和REaLTabFormer上评估10种不同架构类型和深度的模型配置，从运行时间、机器学习效用和与真实数据分布的相似性三个维度进行敏感性分析，使用四个真实世界数据集进行实验。

Result: 运行时间与超参数数量成正比，浅层配置完成更快；GReaT运行时间始终低于REaLTabFormer；小数据集上两种工具都能生成高质量合成数据，但大数据集上只有REaLTabFormer能保持强效用和相似性。

Conclusion: REaLTabFormer配合轻量级LLMs提供最佳平衡，能在保持数据质量的同时降低计算需求，但其运行时间仍高于GReaT和其他TDS工具，表明效率提升存在一定限度。

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data is used for privacy-preserving data sharing and
data-driven model development. Its effectiveness, however, depends heavily on
the used Tabular Data Synthesis (TDS) tool. Recent studies have shown that
Transformer-based models outperform other state-of-the-art models such as
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion models in terms of data
quality. However, Transformer-based models also come with high computational
costs, making them sometimes unfeasible for end users with prosumer hardware.
This study presents a sensitivity assessment on how the choice of
hyperparameters, such as number of layers or hidden dimension affects the
quality of the resultant synthetic data and the computational performance. It
is performed across two tools, GReaT and REaLTabFormer, evaluating 10 model
setups that vary in architecture type and depth. We assess the sensitivity on
three dimensions: runtime, machine learning (ML) utility, and similarity to
real data distributions. Experiments were conducted on four real-world
datasets. Our findings reveal that runtime is proportional to the number of
hyperparameters, with shallower configurations completing faster. GReaT
consistently achieves lower runtimes than REaLTabFormer, and only on the
largest dataset they have comparable runtime. For small datasets, both tools
achieve synthetic data with high utility and optimal similarity, but on larger
datasets only REaLTabFormer sustains strong utility and similarity. As a
result, REaLTabFormer with lightweight LLMs provides the best balance, since it
preserves data quality while reducing computational requirements. Nonetheless,
its runtime remains higher than that of GReaT and other TDS tools, suggesting
that efficiency gains are possible but only up to a certain level.

*Alireza Heidari,Amirhossein Ahmad,Wei Zhang,Ying Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sig2Model是一种高效自适应的学习索引，通过sigmoid增强逼近、主动更新训练和神经联合优化技术，显著降低了动态更新时的重训练成本，提高了查询性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统学习索引在静态数据集上表现出色，但在动态更新时性能下降，因为需要全局模型重训练来维持CDF不变性，这会阻塞查询并限制QPS。现有方法无法有效解决重训练成本问题。

Method: 1) sigmoid增强逼近技术：用局部sigmoid函数逼近数据分布变化，推迟完整重训练；2) 基于高斯混合模型的主动更新训练：识别高更新概率区域进行占位符分配；3) 神经联合优化框架：通过梯度学习持续优化sigmoid集成和GMM参数。

Result: 在真实世界和合成工作负载上的评估显示，Sig2Model将重训练成本降低高达20倍，QPS提高高达3倍，内存使用减少高达1000倍。

Conclusion: Sig2Model通过创新的自适应技术有效解决了学习索引在动态更新环境中的性能瓶颈，为实际工作负载提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Learned Indexes (LIs) represent a paradigm shift from traditional index
structures by employing machine learning models to approximate the cumulative
distribution function (CDF) of sorted data. While LIs achieve remarkable
efficiency for static datasets, their performance degrades under dynamic
updates: maintaining the CDF invariant (sum of F(k) equals 1) requires global
model retraining, which blocks queries and limits the queries-per-second (QPS)
metric. Current approaches fail to address these retraining costs effectively,
rendering them unsuitable for real-world workloads with frequent updates. In
this paper, we present Sig2Model, an efficient and adaptive learned index that
minimizes retraining cost through three key techniques: (1) a sigmoid boosting
approximation technique that dynamically adjusts the index model by
approximating update-induced shifts in data distribution with localized sigmoid
functions while preserving bounded error guarantees and deferring full
retraining; (2) proactive update training via Gaussian mixture models (GMMs)
that identifies high-update-probability regions for strategic placeholder
allocation to speed up updates; and (3) a neural joint optimization framework
that continuously refines both the sigmoid ensemble and GMM parameters via
gradient-based learning. We evaluate Sig2Model against state-of-the-art
updatable learned indexes on real-world and synthetic workloads, and show that
Sig2Model reduces retraining cost by up to 20x, achieves up to 3x higher QPS,
and uses up to 1000x less memory.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合MLP和CNN的新方法，用于处理非平稳时间序列数据中的长期趋势和局部变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的时间序列数据通常具有非平稳性，包括变化的趋势、不规则季节性和残差。现有的MLP模型虽然能有效捕捉长期依赖关系，但由于其线性特性，在处理具有不同分布的通道时存在局限性，容易忽略局部变化如季节模式和残差分量。

Method: 提出将MLP与CNN相结合的方法：使用MLP建模整体趋势以考虑长期依赖关系，同时使用CNN的多核结构建模细粒度局部模式。此外，提出了IConv卷积架构，独立处理时间依赖通道，并通过不同层考虑通道间关系。

Result: 通过在时间序列数据集上的广泛实验，结果表明所提出的方法在多元时间序列预测方面具有优越性。

Conclusion: 结合MLP和CNN的方法能够有效解决时间序列预测中长期趋势建模和局部变化捕捉的问题，IConv架构通过独立通道处理和通道间关系考虑，进一步提升了模型性能并降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Real-world time-series data often exhibit non-stationarity, including
changing trends, irregular seasonality, and residuals. In terms of changing
trends, recently proposed multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based models have shown
excellent performance owing to their computational efficiency and ability to
capture long-term dependency. However, the linear nature of MLP architectures
poses limitations when applied to channels with diverse distributions,
resulting in local variations such as seasonal patterns and residual components
being ignored. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can effectively
incorporate these variations. To resolve the limitations of MLP, we propose
combining them with CNNs. The overall trend is modeled using an MLP to consider
long-term dependencies. The CNN uses diverse kernels to model fine-grained
local patterns in conjunction with MLP trend predictions. To focus on modeling
local variation, we propose IConv, a novel convolutional architecture that
processes the temporal dependency channel independently and considers the
inter-channel relationship through distinct layers. Independent channel
processing enables the modeling of diverse local temporal dependencies and the
adoption of a large kernel size. Distinct inter-channel considerations reduce
computational cost. The proposed model is evaluated through extensive
experiments on time-series datasets. The results reveal the superiority of the
proposed method for multivariate time-series forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LiLAW是一种轻量级自适应加权方法，通过三个可学习参数动态调整训练样本的损失权重，根据样本难度（简单、中等、困难）进行优先级排序，在噪声标签和数据异质性环境下提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在噪声标签和数据异质性存在的情况下训练深度神经网络是一个重大挑战，需要一种能够自适应调整样本权重的方法来提升模型鲁棒性。

Method: LiLAW使用三个可学习参数动态调整每个训练样本的损失权重，基于其动态变化的难度级别。在每个训练小批量后，通过在验证集上执行单个小批量梯度下降步骤来更新权重，无需大量超参数调优或干净验证集。

Result: 在多个通用和医学影像数据集、不同噪声水平和类型、损失函数和架构上的广泛实验表明，LiLAW能持续提升性能，即使在高噪声环境下也有效，且不依赖数据增强或高级正则化。

Conclusion: LiLAW提供了一种计算高效的解决方案，可在任何神经网络训练设置中提升模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性，具有很高的实用性。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks in the presence of noisy labels and data
heterogeneity is a major challenge. We introduce Lightweight Learnable Adaptive
Weighting (LiLAW), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the loss weight of
each training sample based on its evolving difficulty level, categorized as
easy, moderate, or hard. Using only three learnable parameters, LiLAW
adaptively prioritizes informative samples throughout training by updating
these weights using a single mini-batch gradient descent step on the validation
set after each training mini-batch, without requiring excessive hyperparameter
tuning or a clean validation set. Extensive experiments across multiple general
and medical imaging datasets, noise levels and types, loss functions, and
architectures with and without pretraining demonstrate that LiLAW consistently
enhances performance, even in high-noise environments. It is effective without
heavy reliance on data augmentation or advanced regularization, highlighting
its practicality. It offers a computationally efficient solution to boost model
generalization and robustness in any neural network training setup.

TL;DR: 本文提出了任务依赖初始化（TDI）框架，通过功率谱匹配方法使状态空间模型（SSMs）的归纳偏置与任务的光谱特征对齐，从而提高数据效率和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模模型的成功依赖于缩放定律，但高质量数据的有限性带来了挑战。固定归纳偏置的状态空间模型在任务结构与模型不匹配时样本效率低下，需要更数据高效的建模方法。

Method: 首先形式化线性时不变SSMs的归纳偏置，提出TDI方法：通过功率谱匹配在训练前将模型的频率响应与任务的光谱特征对齐。

Result: 在多样化真实世界基准测试中，TDI显著改善了泛化能力和样本效率，特别是在低数据情况下效果明显。

Conclusion: 该工作为创建更数据高效的模型提供了理论和实践工具，是实现可持续缩放的关键一步。

Abstract: The remarkable success of large-scale models is fundamentally tied to scaling
laws, yet the finite nature of high-quality data presents a looming challenge.
One of the next frontiers in modeling is data efficiency: the ability to learn
more from less. A model's inductive bias is a critical lever for this, but
foundational sequence models like State Space Models (SSMs) rely on a fixed
bias. This fixed prior is sample-inefficient when a task's underlying structure
does not match. In this work, we introduce a principled framework to solve this
problem. We first formalize the inductive bias of linear time-invariant SSMs
through an SSM-induced kernel, mathematically and empirically proving its
spectrum is directly governed by the model's frequency response. Further, we
propose a method of Task-Dependent Initialization (TDI): power spectrum
matching, a fast and efficient method that aligns the model's inductive bias
with the task's spectral characteristics before large-scale training. Our
experiments on a diverse set of real-world benchmarks show that TDI
significantly improves generalization and sample efficiency, particularly in
low-data regimes. This work provides a theoretical and practical tool to create
more data-efficient models, a crucial step towards sustainable scaling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了FERD框架，首次在数据自由鲁棒性蒸馏中解决鲁棒公平性问题，通过调整对抗样本的比例和分布来提升最差类别鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据自由鲁棒性蒸馏方法只关注整体鲁棒性，忽视了不同类别间的鲁棒公平性问题，导致学生模型在不同类别上存在显著的鲁棒性差异。

Method: FERD采用鲁棒性引导的类别重加权策略调整样本比例，生成公平感知样本(FAEs)和均匀目标对抗样本(UTAEs)来平衡特征表示和攻击目标分布。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，FERD在最差类别鲁棒性上达到最优性能（如CIFAR-10上FGSM和AutoAttack攻击下的最差类别鲁棒性分别提升15.1%和6.4%）。

Conclusion: FERD框架在保持整体鲁棒性的同时显著改善了鲁棒公平性，为数据自由鲁棒性蒸馏提供了新的公平性增强解决方案。

Abstract: Data-Free Robustness Distillation (DFRD) aims to transfer the robustness from
the teacher to the student without accessing the training data. While existing
methods focus on overall robustness, they overlook the robust fairness issues,
leading to severe disparity of robustness across different categories. In this
paper, we find two key problems: (1) student model distilled with equal class
proportion data behaves significantly different across distinct categories; and
(2) the robustness of student model is not stable across different attacks
target. To bridge these gaps, we present the first Fairness-Enhanced data-free
Robustness Distillation (FERD) framework to adjust the proportion and
distribution of adversarial examples. For the proportion, FERD adopts a
robustness-guided class reweighting strategy to synthesize more samples for the
less robust categories, thereby improving robustness of them. For the
distribution, FERD generates complementary data samples for advanced robustness
distillation. It generates Fairness-Aware Examples (FAEs) by enforcing a
uniformity constraint on feature-level predictions, which suppress the
dominance of class-specific non-robust features, providing a more balanced
representation across all categories. Then, FERD constructs Uniform-Target
Adversarial Examples (UTAEs) from FAEs by applying a uniform target class
constraint to avoid biased attack directions, which distribute the attack
targets across all categories and prevents overfitting to specific vulnerable
categories. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that FERD
achieves state-of-the-art worst-class robustness under all adversarial attack
(e.g., the worst-class robustness under FGSM and AutoAttack are improved by
15.1\% and 6.4\% using MobileNet-V2 on CIFAR-10), demonstrating superior
performance in both robustness and fairness aspects.

TL;DR: 提出T2I-Diff框架，通过时频表示和去噪扩散模型生成fMRI数据，解决传统方法对BOLD信号复杂动态建模不足的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: fMRI数据采集资源密集，高质量样本稀缺，现有生成模型难以捕捉BOLD信号的非平稳性和非线性动态特性

Method: 将BOLD信号转换为窗口化频谱图，使用无分类器去噪扩散模型生成类别条件频谱图，再通过逆傅里叶变换还原为BOLD信号

Result: 在下游fMRI脑网络分类任务中展现出更高的准确性和泛化能力

Conclusion: T2I-Diff框架有效提升了fMRI数据生成质量，为数据驱动的脑分析模型提供了更好的训练数据

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an advanced neuroimaging
method that enables in-depth analysis of brain activity by measuring dynamic
changes in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals. However, the
resource-intensive nature of fMRI data acquisition limits the availability of
high-fidelity samples required for data-driven brain analysis models. While
modern generative models can synthesize fMRI data, they often underperform
because they overlook the complex non-stationarity and nonlinear BOLD dynamics.
To address these challenges, we introduce T2I-Diff, an fMRI generation
framework that leverages time-frequency representation of BOLD signals and
classifier-free denoising diffusion. Specifically, our framework first converts
BOLD signals into windowed spectrograms via a time-dependent Fourier transform,
capturing both the underlying temporal dynamics and spectral evolution.
Subsequently, a classifier-free diffusion model is trained to generate
class-conditioned frequency spectrograms, which are then reverted to BOLD
signals via inverse Fourier transforms. Finally, we validate the efficacy of
our approach by demonstrating improved accuracy and generalization in
downstream fMRI-based brain network classification.

TL;DR: CaTS-Bench是第一个大规模、真实世界的情境感知时间序列字幕基准，包含465k训练和105k测试时间戳，整合了数值序列、元数据、线图图像和字幕，并提供了460个多选题来评估时间序列推理能力。

Result: 提出了新的定制评估指标，并对领先的视觉语言模型进行基准测试，揭示了它们的优势和持续局限性。

Conclusion: CaTS-Bench及其字幕流水线为时间序列分析与基础模型的交叉研究提供了可靠且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Time series captioning, the task of describing numeric time series in natural
language, requires numerical reasoning, trend interpretation, and contextual
understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, often rely on synthetic data or
overly simplistic captions, and typically neglect metadata and visual
representations. To close this gap, we introduce CaTS-Bench, the first
large-scale, real-world benchmark for Context-aware Time Series captioning.
CaTS-Bench is derived from 11 diverse datasets reframed as captioning and Q&A
tasks, comprising roughly 465k training and 105k test timestamps. Each sample
includes a numeric series segment, contextual metadata, a line-chart image, and
a caption. A key contribution of this work is the scalable pipeline used to
generate reference captions: while most references are produced by an oracle
LLM and verified through factual checks, human indistinguishability studies,
and diversity analyses, we also provide a human-revisited subset of 579 test
captions, refined from LLM outputs to ensure accuracy and human-like style.
Beyond captioning, CaTS-Bench offers 460 multiple-choice questions targeting
deeper aspects of time series reasoning. We further propose new tailored
evaluation metrics and benchmark leading VLMs, highlighting both their
strengths and persistent limitations. Together, these contributions establish
CaTS-Bench and its captioning pipeline as a reliable and extensible foundation
for future research at the intersection of time series analysis and foundation
models.

Motivation: 深度神经网络训练动态中的后期现象（如grokking和信息瓶颈）机制及其关系尚未被充分理解，需要统一的理论解释。

Method: 通过神经坍缩理论分析学习表示的几何特性，研究类内方差收缩的动态过程，并在多个数据集和架构上进行验证。

Result: 发现类内方差收缩是grokking和信息瓶颈现象的关键因素，训练集拟合与神经坍缩进展的不同时间尺度解释了这些后期现象的行为。

Conclusion: 神经坍缩为理解深度神经网络训练中的后期现象提供了统一框架，揭示了类内方差收缩在模型优化过程中的重要作用。

Abstract: The training dynamics of deep neural networks often defy expectations, even
as these models form the foundation of modern machine learning. Two prominent
examples are grokking, where test performance improves abruptly long after the
training loss has plateaued, and the information bottleneck principle, where
models progressively discard input information irrelevant to the prediction
task as training proceeds. However, the mechanisms underlying these phenomena
and their relations remain poorly understood. In this work, we present a
unified explanation of such late-phase phenomena through the lens of neural
collapse, which characterizes the geometry of learned representations. We show
that the contraction of population within-class variance is a key factor
underlying both grokking and information bottleneck, and relate this measure to
the neural collapse measure defined on the training set. By analyzing the
dynamics of neural collapse, we show that distinct time scales between fitting
the training set and the progression of neural collapse account for the
behavior of the late-phase phenomena. Finally, we validate our theoretical
findings on multiple datasets and architectures.

Motivation: 多模态融合中常出现模态竞争问题，即一个模态主导学习过程而其他模态优化不足。现有方法大多在联合学习阶段解决此问题，忽视了模型初始状态的关键影响。

Method: 1) 提出有效竞争强度(ECS)量化模态竞争力；2) 证明互信息是ECS的理论代理；3) 开发FastPID进行部分信息分解，测量模态特异性、冗余性和协同性；4) 设计异步训练控制器动态平衡模态并定位理想初始状态。

Conclusion: 塑造预融合模型的初始状态是一种有效策略，能够在竞争开始前缓解问题，可靠地实现协同多模态融合。

Abstract: Multi-modal fusion often suffers from modality competition during joint
training, where one modality dominates the learning process, leaving others
under-optimized. Overlooking the critical impact of the model's initial state,
most existing methods address this issue during the joint learning stage. In
this study, we introduce a two-stage training framework to shape the initial
states through unimodal training before the joint training. First, we propose
the concept of Effective Competitive Strength (ECS) to quantify a modality's
competitive strength. Our theoretical analysis further reveals that properly
shaping the initial ECS by unimodal training achieves a provably tighter error
bound. However, ECS is computationally intractable in deep neural networks. To
bridge this gap, we develop a framework comprising two core components: a
fine-grained computable diagnostic metric and an asynchronous training
controller. For the metric, we first prove that mutual information(MI) is a
principled proxy for ECS. Considering MI is induced by per-modality marginals
and thus treats each modality in isolation, we further propose FastPID, a
computationally efficient and differentiable solver for partial information
decomposition, which decomposes the joint distribution's information into
fine-grained measurements: modality-specific uniqueness, redundancy, and
synergy. Guided by these measurements, our asynchronous controller dynamically
balances modalities by monitoring uniqueness and locates the ideal initial
state to start joint training by tracking peak synergy. Experiments on diverse
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Our work establishes that shaping the pre-fusion models' initial state is a
powerful strategy that eases competition before it starts, reliably unlocking
synergistic multi-modal fusion.

TL;DR: MOIRA是一种多组学数据整合方法，能够处理缺失模态的数据，通过表示对齐和自适应聚合实现鲁棒学习，在阿尔茨海默病研究中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多组学数据能够捕捉复杂的生物分子相互作用，但数据模态缺失问题阻碍了异质组学数据的整合分析。

Method: MOIRA采用早期整合方法，将每个组学数据集投影到共享嵌入空间，通过可学习的加权机制融合不同模态，利用包括缺失模态在内的所有样本进行学习。

Result: 在ROSMAP阿尔茨海默病数据集上的评估显示，MOIRA优于现有方法，特征重要性分析揭示了与文献一致的AD相关生物标志物。

Conclusion: 该方法具有生物学相关性，能够有效处理多组学数据中的模态缺失问题。

Abstract: Multi-omics data capture complex biomolecular interactions and provide
insights into metabolism and disease. However, missing modalities hinder
integrative analysis across heterogeneous omics. To address this, we present
MOIRA (Multi-Omics Integration with Robustness to Absent modalities), an early
integration method enabling robust learning from incomplete omics data via
representation alignment and adaptive aggregation. MOIRA leverages all samples,
including those with missing modalities, by projecting each omics dataset onto
a shared embedding space where a learnable weighting mechanism fuses them.
Evaluated on the Religious Order Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP)
dataset for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), MOIRA outperformed existing approaches,
and further ablation studies confirmed modality-wise contributions. Feature
importance analysis revealed AD-related biomarkers consistent with prior
literature, highlighting the biological relevance of our approach.

TL;DR: 本文提出了因果时间序列生成(CaTSG)作为新的TSG任务家族，基于Pearl因果阶梯框架，将传统观测生成扩展到干预和反事实生成。开发了统一扩散框架，通过后门调整指导实现因果导向的采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有条件时间序列生成模型仅学习观测相关性，未考虑未观测混杂因素。需要从因果视角重新审视TSG，支持干预和反事实推理。

Method: CaTSG框架：基于扩散模型，通过后门调整推导因果评分函数，采用溯因-行动-预测程序，支持观测、干预和反事实三个层次的生成。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，CaTSG在保真度上优于基线，并能处理现有方法无法支持的干预和反事实生成任务。

Conclusion: 提出了因果TSG任务家族并通过CaTSG实例化，为在干预和反事实条件下实现更可靠模拟开辟了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Time series generation (TSG) synthesizes realistic sequences and has achieved
remarkable success. Among TSG, conditional models generate sequences given
observed covariates, however, such models learn observational correlations
without considering unobserved confounding. In this work, we propose a causal
perspective on conditional TSG and introduce causal time series generation as a
new TSG task family, formalized within Pearl's causal ladder, extending beyond
observational generation to include interventional and counterfactual settings.
To instantiate these tasks, we develop CaTSG, a unified diffusion-based
framework with backdoor-adjusted guidance that causally steers sampling toward
desired interventions and individual counterfactuals while preserving
observational fidelity. Specifically, our method derives causal score functions
via backdoor adjustment and the abduction-action-prediction procedure, thus
enabling principled support for all three levels of TSG. Extensive experiments
on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that CaTSG achieves superior
fidelity and also supporting interventional and counterfactual generation that
existing baselines cannot handle. Overall, we propose the causal TSG family and
instantiate it with CaTSG, providing an initial proof-of-concept and opening a
promising direction toward more reliable simulation under interventions and
counterfactual generation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于掩码变换器自编码器的方法，用于重建缺失的胎儿心率信号，解决了可穿戴设备监测中因信号丢失导致的数据分析难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大约10%的新生儿需要呼吸辅助，5%需要通气支持。胎儿心率监测对评估胎儿健康至关重要，但可穿戴设备在监测过程中常因传感器位移导致信号丢失，传统插值方法无法保持信号频谱特性，限制了AI分析的有效性。

Method: 采用掩码变换器自编码器方法，通过捕捉数据的空间和频率成分来重建缺失的胎儿心率信号。该方法对不同程度的信号缺失具有鲁棒性，可用于信号修复和预测。

Result: 提出的方法能够有效处理不同持续时间的信号缺失问题，保持信号的频谱特性，为基于AI的风险算法开发提供支持。

Conclusion: 该方法可应用于回顾性研究数据集，未来有望集成到可穿戴胎儿心率监测设备中，实现更早期、更稳健的风险检测。

Abstract: Approximately 10\% of newborns require assistance to initiate breathing at
birth, and around 5\% need ventilation support. Fetal heart rate (FHR)
monitoring plays a crucial role in assessing fetal well-being during prenatal
care, enabling the detection of abnormal patterns and supporting timely
obstetric interventions to mitigate fetal risks during labor. Applying
artificial intelligence (AI) methods to analyze large datasets of continuous
FHR monitoring episodes with diverse outcomes may offer novel insights into
predicting the risk of needing breathing assistance or interventions. Recent
advances in wearable FHR monitors have enabled continuous fetal monitoring
without compromising maternal mobility. However, sensor displacement during
maternal movement, as well as changes in fetal or maternal position, often lead
to signal dropouts, resulting in gaps in the recorded FHR data. Such missing
data limits the extraction of meaningful insights and complicates automated
(AI-based) analysis. Traditional approaches to handle missing data, such as
simple interpolation techniques, often fail to preserve the spectral
characteristics of the signals. In this paper, we propose a masked
transformer-based autoencoder approach to reconstruct missing FHR signals by
capturing both spatial and frequency components of the data. The proposed
method demonstrates robustness across varying durations of missing data and can
be used for signal inpainting and forecasting. The proposed approach can be
applied retrospectively to research datasets to support the development of
AI-based risk algorithms. In the future, the proposed method could be
integrated into wearable FHR monitoring devices to achieve earlier and more
robust risk detection.

Conclusion: FMI方法能有效解决联邦学习中时间序列数据的缺失问题，提升预测性能

Abstract: Missing data is a persistent challenge in federated learning on electronic

varying temporal granularities. To address this, we propose Federated Markov
Imputation (FMI), a privacy-preserving method that enables Intensive Care Units

imputation. We evaluate FMI on a real-world sepsis onset prediction task using
the MIMIC-IV dataset and show that it outperforms local imputation baselines,
especially in scenarios with irregular sampling intervals across ICUs.

TL;DR: StyleBench是一个系统评估不同推理风格在多样化任务和模型上表现的基准，研究发现没有单一最优推理策略，策略效果高度依赖于模型规模和任务类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的效果受推理策略影响很大，但目前对这些推理风格、模型架构和任务类型之间的相互作用理解不足。

Method: 评估了5种代表性推理风格（CoT、ToT、AoT、SoT、CoD）在5个推理任务上的表现，使用了15个开源模型（参数从270M到120B）。

Result: 搜索类方法在开放性问题中表现优异但需要大规模模型，简洁风格在定义明确任务上效率更高；小模型经常无法遵循输出指令而默认猜测，推理鲁棒性随规模增长而提升。

Conclusion: 研究结果为基于特定约束选择最优推理策略提供了重要路线图，并开源了基准测试工具。

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily influenced by
the reasoning strategies, or styles of thought, employed in their prompts.
However, the interplay between these reasoning styles, model architecture, and
task type remains poorly understood. To address this, we introduce StyleBench,
a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating reasoning styles across
diverse tasks and models. We assess five representative reasoning styles,
including Chain of Thought (CoT), Tree of Thought (ToT), Algorithm of Thought
(AoT), Sketch of Thought (SoT), and Chain-of-Draft (CoD) on five reasoning
tasks, using 15 open-source models from major families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral,
Gemma, GPT-OSS, Phi, and DeepSeek) ranging from 270M to 120B parameters. Our
large-scale analysis reveals that no single style is universally optimal. We
demonstrate that strategy efficacy is highly contingent on both model scale and
task type: search-based methods (AoT, ToT) excel in open-ended problems but
require large-scale models, while concise styles (SoT, CoD) achieve radical
efficiency gains on well-defined tasks. Furthermore, we identify key behavioral
patterns: smaller models frequently fail to follow output instructions and
default to guessing, while reasoning robustness emerges as a function of scale.
Our findings offer a crucial roadmap for selecting optimal reasoning strategies
based on specific constraints, we open source the benchmark in
https://github.com/JamesJunyuGuo/Style_Bench.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种处理随机传感器延迟的模型强化学习框架，通过基于模型的滤波过程来更新信念状态，使智能体能够有效处理观测延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中经常存在延迟，但标准强化学习算法通常假设环境感知是即时的。本文研究POMDP中的随机传感器延迟问题，这种设置之前未在RL中得到充分解决。

Method: 提出基于模型的滤波过程，顺序更新基于传入观测流的信念状态，并将其整合到模型强化学习中，形成延迟感知框架。将该框架应用于Dreamer算法。

Result: 该方法在延迟感知基准测试中表现优于MDP的基线方法，并在部署期间对延迟分布变化表现出鲁棒性。在模拟机器人任务上的实验也优于常见实用启发式方法。

Conclusion: 明确建模观测延迟对于处理现实环境中的延迟问题至关重要，提出的延迟感知框架能够有效提升强化学习算法在延迟环境中的性能。

Abstract: Delays frequently occur in real-world environments, yet standard
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms often assume instantaneous perception of
the environment. We study random sensor delays in POMDPs, where observations
may arrive out-of-sequence, a setting that has not been previously addressed in
RL. We analyze the structure of such delays and demonstrate that naive
approaches, such as stacking past observations, are insufficient for reliable
performance. To address this, we propose a model-based filtering process that
sequentially updates the belief state based on an incoming stream of
observations. We then introduce a simple delay-aware framework that
incorporates this idea into model-based RL, enabling agents to effectively
handle random delays. Applying this framework to Dreamer, we compare our
approach to delay-aware baselines developed for MDPs. Our method consistently
outperforms these baselines and demonstrates robustness to delay distribution
shifts during deployment. Additionally, we present experiments on simulated
robotic tasks, comparing our method to common practical heuristics and
emphasizing the importance of explicitly modeling observation delays.

### [208] [Distribution-Controlled Client Selection to Improve Federated Learning Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20877)
*Christoph Düsing,Philipp Cimiano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种联邦学习中的客户端选择方法，通过控制标签分布来缓解数据不平衡问题，实验证明该方法能有效提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中客户端数据不平衡会降低共享模型的性能，现有方法主要通过客户端选择来缓解这一问题。

Method: 提出分布控制的客户端选择策略，选择能使当前标签分布与目标分布（平衡分布或联邦组合标签分布）最佳对齐的活跃客户端。

Result: 在三种常见FL策略和两个数据集上的实验表明，面对局部不平衡时，与平衡分布对齐效果最好；面对全局不平衡时，与联邦组合标签分布对齐更优。

Conclusion: 分布控制的客户端选择能有效提升联邦学习在数据不平衡场景下的性能，针对不同类型的不平衡问题需要采用不同的目标分布策略。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that allows
multiple clients to jointly train a shared model while maintaining data
privacy. Despite its great potential for domains with strict data privacy
requirements, the presence of data imbalance among clients is a thread to the
success of FL, as it causes the performance of the shared model to decrease. To
address this, various studies have proposed enhancements to existing FL
strategies, particularly through client selection methods that mitigate the
detrimental effects of data imbalance. In this paper, we propose an extension
to existing FL strategies, which selects active clients that best align the
current label distribution with one of two target distributions, namely a
balanced distribution or the federations combined label distribution.
Subsequently, we empirically verify the improvements through our
distribution-controlled client selection on three common FL strategies and two
datasets. Our results show that while aligning the label distribution with a
balanced distribution yields the greatest improvements facing local imbalance,
alignment with the federation's combined label distribution is superior for
global imbalance.

Motivation: 解决ICU中脓毒症早期准确预测的挑战，克服单个医院数据量有限的问题，同时保护患者隐私

Method: 使用联邦学习框架训练注意力增强的LSTM模型，支持可变预测窗口，在多中心ICU数据上进行协作训练

Result: 联邦学习不仅提高了整体预测性能（接近集中式模型），而且特别有利于脓毒症的早期预测

Conclusion: 可变预测窗口方法在性能损失不大的情况下显著减少了计算、通信和组织开销

Abstract: Early and accurate prediction of sepsis onset remains a major challenge in
intensive care, where timely detection and subsequent intervention can
significantly improve patient outcomes. While machine learning models have
shown promise in this domain, their success is often limited by the amount and
diversity of training data available to individual hospitals and Intensive Care
Units (ICUs). Federated Learning (FL) addresses this issue by enabling
collaborative model training across institutions without requiring data
sharing, thus preserving patient privacy. In this work, we propose a federated,
attention-enhanced Long Short-Term Memory model for sepsis onset prediction,
trained on multi-centric ICU data. Unlike existing approaches that rely on
fixed prediction windows, our model supports variable prediction horizons,
enabling both short- and long-term forecasting in a single unified model.
During analysis, we put particular emphasis on the improvements through our
approach in terms of early sepsis detection, i.e., predictions with large
prediction windows by conducting an in-depth temporal analysis. Our results
prove that using FL does not merely improve overall prediction performance
(with performance approaching that of a centralized model), but is particularly
beneficial for early sepsis onset prediction. Finally, we show that our choice
of employing a variable prediction window rather than a fixed window does not
hurt performance significantly but reduces computational, communicational, and
organizational overhead.

Motivation: 现有离散扩散模型的生成反向过程是随机的，本文旨在开发确定性去噪方法以提高效率和样本质量。

Method: 使用马尔可夫链和弱混沌动力学的herding算法变体来确定性化反向过程，直接替代随机去噪过程。

Result: 在文本和图像生成任务中实现了效率和样本质量的一致提升。

Conclusion: 这种简单的确定性化方法有望增强离散扩散在生成建模中的重要性，并证明确定性反向过程在离散状态空间同样有效。

Abstract: We propose a deterministic denoising algorithm for discrete-state diffusion
models based on Markov chains. The generative reverse process is derandomized
by introducing a variant of the herding algorithm with weakly chaotic dynamics,
which induces deterministic discrete state transitions. Our approach is a
direct replacement for the stochastic denoising process, requiring neither
retraining nor continuous state embeddings. We demonstrate consistent
improvements in both efficiency and sample quality on text and image generation
tasks. Thus, this simple derandomization approach is expected to enhance the
significance of discrete diffusion in generative modeling. Furthermore, our
results reveal that deterministic reverse processes, well established in
continuous diffusion, can also be effective in discrete state spaces.

Motivation: 现有犯罪预测研究缺乏对微观移动特征的整合，需要探索如何结合多种数据源提升预测精度。

Method: 使用ConvLSTM网络，结合14天和2天的输入序列，预测未来12小时的犯罪发生，并与逻辑回归、随机森林和标准LSTM进行对比。

Result: 结合移动特征和社会人口特征时预测效果最佳，深度学习模型在所有四个城市中均取得最高召回率、精确率和F1分数。

Conclusion: 多种数据源的整合对时空犯罪预测至关重要，深度学习在处理精细时空尺度时具有优势但也有局限性。

Abstract: Objectives: To develop a deep learning framework to evaluate if and how
incorporating micro-level mobility features, alongside historical crime and
sociodemographic data, enhances predictive performance in crime forecasting at
fine-grained spatial and temporal resolutions.
  Methods: We advance the literature on computational methods and crime
forecasting by focusing on four U.S. cities (i.e., Baltimore, Chicago, Los
Angeles, and Philadelphia). We employ crime incident data obtained from each
city's police department, combined with sociodemographic data from the American
Community Survey and human mobility data from Advan, collected from 2019 to
2023. This data is aggregated into grids with equally sized cells of 0.077 sq.
miles (0.2 sq. kms) and used to train our deep learning forecasting model, a
Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network, which predicts crime
occurrences 12 hours ahead using 14-day and 2-day input sequences. We also
compare its performance against three baseline models: logistic regression,
random forest, and standard LSTM.
  Results: Incorporating mobility features improves predictive performance,
especially when using shorter input sequences. Noteworthy, however, the best
results are obtained when both mobility and sociodemographic features are used
together, with our deep learning model achieving the highest recall, precision,
and F1 score in all four cities, outperforming alternative methods. With this
configuration, longer input sequences enhance predictions for violent crimes,
while shorter sequences are more effective for property crimes.
  Conclusion: These findings underscore the importance of integrating diverse
data sources for spatiotemporal crime forecasting, mobility included. They also
highlight the advantages (and limits) of deep learning when dealing with
fine-grained spatial and temporal scales.

Conclusion: 提出的PFCV方法可显著提高重型土方设备线性执行器的能效，有助于减少环境影响和运营成本。

Abstract: The article focuses on enhancing the energy efficiency of linear actuators
used in heavy earth moving equipment, particularly in the booms ofexcavation
equipment. Two hydraulic circuits are compared in terms of energy efficiency,
with one using a conventional proportional directionalcontrol valve (PDCV) and
the other using an innovative solution of proportional flow control valve
(PFCV) with artificial leakage between thetwo ends of the actuator. The PFCV
reduces energy loss in the form of heat by bypassing the extra flow from the
pump during position control,unlike the PDCV that uses a pressure relief valve.
The hydraulic circuit using PFCV is found to be 8.5% more energy efficient than
theconventional circuit using PDCV. The article also discusses the position
control of the actuator, which is achieved using a PID controller tuned by a
fuzzy controller. Thesimulation of the hydraulic circuit is carried out using
MATLAB/Simulink, and the results are compared with experiments. Overall, the
proposedapproach could lead to significant improvements in the energy
efficiency of linear actuators used in heavy earth moving equipment,
therebyreducing their environmental impact and operating costs.

Conclusion: 对于时间序列数据的可操作反事实解释，合理性和以用户为中心的可解释性比稀疏性更重要。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations aim to enhance model transparency by showing how
inputs can be minimally altered to change predictions. For multivariate time
series, existing methods often generate counterfactuals that are invalid,
implausible, or unintuitive. We introduce GenFacts, a generative framework
based on a class-discriminative variational autoencoder. It integrates
contrastive and classification-consistency objectives, prototype-based
initialization, and realism-constrained optimization. We evaluate GenFacts on
radar gesture data as an industrial use case and handwritten letter
trajectories as an intuitive benchmark. Across both datasets, GenFacts
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in plausibility (+18.7%) and achieves
the highest interpretability scores in a human study. These results highlight
that plausibility and user-centered interpretability, rather than sparsity
alone, are key to actionable counterfactuals in time series data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer在NLP和CV领域表现出色，但在时间序列预测中甚至不如简单线性基线，但之前的研究未能深入探索Transformer失效的原因。

Method: 设计了一系列实验，逐步将Transformer修改为MLP来研究注意力机制的影响，并创建可解释的数据集来分析注意力机制失效的原因，同时进行了理论分析。

Result: 发现现有的时间序列Transformer中，Transformer块经常退化为简单MLP，注意力机制没有按预期方式工作，当前嵌入方法存在问题。

Conclusion: 需要重新设计时间序列的嵌入方法，使Transformer能够在结构良好的潜在空间中有效工作，这是提升时间序列Transformer性能的关键。

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures achieved high performance in natural language
processing and computer vision, yet many studies have shown that they have not
demonstrated a clear advantage in time series forecasting and even underperform
simple linear baselines in some cases. However, most of these studies have not
thoroughly explored the reasons behind the failure of transformers. To better
understand time-series transformers(TST), we designed a series of experiments,
progressively modifying transformers into MLPs to investigate the impact of the
attention mechanism. Surprisingly, transformer blocks often degenerate into
simple MLPs in existing time-series transformers. We designed a interpretable
dataset to investigate the reasons behind the failure of the attention
mechanism and revealed that the attention mechanism is not working in the
expected way. We theoretically analyzed the reasons behind this phenomenon,
demonstrating that the current embedding methods fail to allow transformers to
function in a well-structured latent space, and further analyzed the deeper
underlying causes of the failure of embedding.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种解耦值注意力机制（DVA），用于改进先验数据拟合网络（PFNs）在高维回归任务中的性能，使其能够更高效地替代高斯过程进行物理系统建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer注意力在PFNs中对高维回归任务效果有限，而高斯过程的函数空间完全由输入核和训练目标的加权和表征，这启发了DVA的设计。

Method: 提出DVA注意力机制，仅从输入计算相似度，通过值传播标签，无需核函数即可模拟高斯过程更新。验证了注意力规则而非架构本身是扩展PFNs的关键因素。

Result: 局部注意力在PFNs中显著降低验证损失（5维和10维情况下减少50%以上），CNN-based PFNs性能与Transformer-based相当。64维电力流方程近似平均绝对误差达1E-3，比精确GP推理快80倍以上。

Conclusion: DVA注意力机制是PFNs扩展的关键，能够有效替代高斯过程进行高效建模，注意力规则比架构选择更重要。

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) are a promising alternative to
time-consuming Gaussian Process (GP) inference for creating fast surrogates of
physical systems. PFN reduces the computational burden of GP-training by
replacing Bayesian inference in GP with a single forward pass of a learned
prediction model. However, with standard Transformer attention, PFNs show
limited effectiveness on high-dimensional regression tasks. We introduce
Decoupled-Value Attention (DVA)-- motivated by the GP property that the
function space is fully characterized by the kernel over inputs and the
predictive mean is a weighted sum of training targets. DVA computes
similarities from inputs only and propagates labels solely through values.
Thus, the proposed DVA mirrors the Gaussian-process update while remaining
kernel-free. We demonstrate that the crucial factor for scaling PFNs is the
attention rule rather than the architecture itself. Specifically, our results
demonstrate that (a) localized attention consistently reduces out-of-sample
validation loss in PFNs across different dimensional settings, with validation
loss reduced by more than 50% in five- and ten-dimensional cases, and (b) the
role of attention is more decisive than the choice of backbone architecture,
showing that CNN-based PFNs can perform at par with their Transformer-based
counterparts. The proposed PFNs provide 64-dimensional power flow equation
approximations with a mean absolute error of the order of 1E-3, while being
over 80x faster than exact GP inference.

Method: 提出LCF混合训练协议，在低噪声水平下用对比特征对齐替代直接速度回归，在中高噪声水平下保留标准flow matching

Result: LCF不仅提高了收敛速度，还稳定了表示质量

Conclusion: 解决低噪声病理问题对于充分发挥flow matching在生成和表示学习中的潜力至关重要

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to diffusion
models, providing a continuous-time formulation for generative modeling and
representation learning. Yet, we show that this framework suffers from a
fundamental instability in the low-noise regime. As noise levels approach zero,
arbitrarily small perturbations in the input can induce large variations in the
velocity target, causing the condition number of the learning problem to
diverge. This ill-conditioning not only slows optimization but also forces the
encoder to reallocate its limited Jacobian capacity toward noise directions,
thereby degrading semantic representations. We provide the first theoretical
analysis of this phenomenon, which we term the low-noise pathology,
establishing its intrinsic link to the structure of the flow matching
objective. Building on these insights, we propose Local Contrastive Flow (LCF),
a hybrid training protocol that replaces direct velocity regression with
contrastive feature alignment at small noise levels, while retaining standard
flow matching at moderate and high noise. Empirically, LCF not only improves
convergence speed but also stabilizes representation quality. Our findings
highlight the critical importance of addressing low-noise pathologies to unlock
the full potential of flow matching for both generation and representation
learning.

TL;DR: MixGate框架通过功能对齐解决多视图布尔电路学习中结构异质性导致的融合困难问题，采用先对齐后掩码建模的训练策略


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视图布尔电路学习具有巨大潜力，但不同视图（如AIG与XMG）之间的结构异质性阻碍了有效融合，特别是对于掩码建模等自监督技术，跨视图上下文被误认为噪声

Method: 提出MixGate框架，基于原则性训练课程：首先通过等价对齐损失教导模型学习共享的、功能感知的表示空间，然后引入多视图掩码建模目标

Result: 广泛的实验（包括关键消融研究）表明，对齐优先策略将掩码建模从无效技术转变为强大的性能驱动因素

Conclusion: 功能对齐是多视图自监督发挥效力的必要前提条件，MixGate框架成功解决了多视图布尔电路学习中的融合挑战

Abstract: Multiview learning on Boolean circuits holds immense promise, as different
graph-based representations offer complementary structural and semantic
information. However, the vast structural heterogeneity between views, such as
an And-Inverter Graph (AIG) versus an XOR-Majority Graph (XMG), poses a
critical barrier to effective fusion, especially for self-supervised techniques
like masked modeling. Naively applying such methods fails, as the cross-view
context is perceived as noise. Our key insight is that functional alignment is
a necessary precondition to unlock the power of multiview self-supervision. We
introduce MixGate, a framework built on a principled training curriculum that
first teaches the model a shared, function-aware representation space via an
Equivalence Alignment Loss. Only then do we introduce a multiview masked
modeling objective, which can now leverage the aligned views as a rich,
complementary signal. Extensive experiments, including a crucial ablation
study, demonstrate that our alignment-first strategy transforms masked modeling
from an ineffective technique into a powerful performance driver.

TL;DR: LEON是一种利用大型语言模型作为黑盒优化器的方法，通过结合医学教科书和生物医学知识图谱等先验知识，为患者提供个性化的治疗计划，而无需进行特定任务的微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化医学的目标是根据患者的个人遗传和环境因素优化治疗方案，但无法随意测试候选治疗的效果。现有的替代模型在泛化到未见过的患者-治疗组合时表现不佳，因此需要利用领域特定的先验知识来提供更准确的信号。

Method: LEON通过'提示优化'实现，使用LLM作为随机引擎提出治疗设计，结合领域知识（如医学教科书和生物医学知识图谱）来指导优化过程。

Result: 在真实世界的优化任务中，LEON在提出个性化治疗方案方面优于传统方法和基于LLM的方法。

Conclusion: LEON提供了一种数学上严谨的方法，能够有效利用LLM和领域知识来优化个性化治疗计划，展示了在个性化医学中的潜力。

Abstract: The goal of personalized medicine is to discover a treatment regimen that
optimizes a patient's clinical outcome based on their personal genetic and
environmental factors. However, candidate treatments cannot be arbitrarily
administered to the patient to assess their efficacy; we often instead have
access to an in silico surrogate model that approximates the true fitness of a
proposed treatment. Unfortunately, such surrogate models have been shown to
fail to generalize to previously unseen patient-treatment combinations. We
hypothesize that domain-specific prior knowledge - such as medical textbooks
and biomedical knowledge graphs - can provide a meaningful alternative signal
of the fitness of proposed treatments. To this end, we introduce LLM-based
Entropy-guided Optimization with kNowledgeable priors (LEON), a mathematically
principled approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as black-box
optimizers without any task-specific fine-tuning, taking advantage of their
ability to contextualize unstructured domain knowledge to propose personalized
treatment plans in natural language. In practice, we implement LEON via
'optimization by prompting,' which uses LLMs as stochastic engines for
proposing treatment designs. Experiments on real-world optimization tasks show
LEON outperforms both traditional and LLM-based methods in proposing
individualized treatments for patients.

TL;DR: 本文提出了CLUE框架，通过电路发现技术识别LLM中负责遗忘和保留知识的不同神经元电路，并使用CNF可满足性解决方案来精确指导神经元干预，从而在保持模型性能的同时有效消除不良知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于定位的LLM遗忘方法无法区分负责遗忘不良知识和保留必要技能的神经元，将它们视为单一纠缠群体，导致过度遗忘或目标知识擦除不完整的问题。

Method: 采用电路发现机制解释技术，识别遗忘和保留电路，将其转换为合取范式（CNF），通过CNF可满足性解决方案确定每个神经元应该被遗忘还是保留，并为不同类别神经元提供有针对性的微调策略。

Result: 大量实验表明，与现有定位方法相比，CLUE通过精确的神经定位实现了更优的遗忘效果和保留效用。

Conclusion: CLUE框架通过分离遗忘和保留电路，解决了现有方法中神经元纠缠的问题，为LLM安全遗忘提供了更精确有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The LLM unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of undesirable data
without affecting causally unrelated information. This process typically
involves using a forget set to remove target information, alongside a retain
set to maintain non-target capabilities. While recent localization-based
methods demonstrate promise in identifying important neurons to be unlearned,
they fail to disentangle neurons responsible for forgetting undesirable
knowledge or retaining essential skills, often treating them as a single
entangled group. As a result, these methods apply uniform interventions,
risking catastrophic over-forgetting or incomplete erasure of the target
knowledge. To address this, we turn to circuit discovery, a mechanistic
interpretability technique, and propose the Conflict-guided Localization for
LLM Unlearning framEwork (CLUE). This framework identifies the forget and
retain circuit composed of important neurons, and then the circuits are
transformed into conjunctive normal forms (CNF). The assignment of each neuron
in the CNF satisfiability solution reveals whether it should be forgotten or
retained. We then provide targeted fine-tuning strategies for different
categories of neurons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to
existing localization methods, CLUE achieves superior forget efficacy and
retain utility through precise neural localization.

TL;DR: FracAug是一个创新的图级异常检测增强框架，通过生成语义一致的图变体和互验证伪标注来提升图神经网络的性能，解决了数据标注成本高和数据集不平衡的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图级异常检测在药物发现等领域至关重要，但高标注成本和数据集不平衡限制了图神经网络的性能。现有启发式方法效果有限，需要一种能够学习图语义并生成多样化、语义保持的图变体的方法。

Method: FracAug通过两个核心组件工作：1）学习图内语义并合成分数变体，使用加权距离感知边缘损失来捕捉多尺度拓扑；2）利用原始图和增强图的预测结果对未标注数据进行伪标注，迭代扩展训练集。该框架是模型无关的，可与各种图神经网络兼容。

Result: 在12个真实数据集上对14种图神经网络进行的实验表明，FracAug能显著提升性能，平均AUROC、AUPRC和F1分数分别提高了5.72%、7.23%和4.18%。

Conclusion: FracAug作为一个通用的增强框架，能够有效解决图级异常检测中的数据不平衡和标注成本问题，在各种图神经网络上都表现出显著的性能提升和广泛适用性。

Abstract: Graph-level anomaly detection (GAD) is critical in diverse domains such as
drug discovery, yet high labeling costs and dataset imbalance hamper the
performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). To address these issues, we
propose FracAug, an innovative plug-in augmentation framework that enhances
GNNs by generating semantically consistent graph variants and pseudo-labeling
with mutual verification. Unlike previous heuristic methods, FracAug learns
semantics within given graphs and synthesizes fractional variants, guided by a
novel weighted distance-aware margin loss. This captures multi-scale topology
to generate diverse, semantic-preserving graphs unaffected by data imbalance.
Then, FracAug utilizes predictions from both original and augmented graphs to
pseudo-label unlabeled data, iteratively expanding the training set. As a
model-agnostic module compatible with various GNNs, FracAug demonstrates
remarkable universality and efficacy: experiments across 14 GNNs on 12
real-world datasets show consistent gains, boosting average AUROC, AUPRC, and
F1-score by up to 5.72%, 7.23%, and 4.18%, respectively.

Motivation: 现有癌症筛查技术昂贵且侵入性强，全球普及度低，导致许多本可挽救的生命流失。需要开发更易获取的早期筛查方法。

Method: 基于数百万电子健康记录建立医疗代码序列的扩展定律，预训练计算最优的基础模型（最大24亿参数），并在临床医生策划的癌症风险预测队列上进行微调。

Result: 在三万名患者的回顾性评估中，CATCH-FM达到60%敏感性和99%特异性，显著优于基于特征的树模型和通用/医疗大语言模型。在EHRSHOT少样本排行榜上实现最先进的胰腺癌风险预测。

Conclusion: CATCH-FM在不同患者分布中表现稳健，在ICD代码空间中操作有优势，能够捕捉非平凡的癌症风险因素，代码将开源。

Abstract: Cancer screening, leading to early detection, saves lives. Unfortunately,
existing screening techniques require expensive and intrusive medical
procedures, not globally available, resulting in too many lost would-be-saved
lives. We present CATCH-FM, CATch Cancer early with Healthcare Foundation
Models, a cancer pre-screening methodology that identifies high-risk patients
for further screening solely based on their historical medical records. With
millions of electronic healthcare records (EHR), we establish the scaling law
of EHR foundation models pretrained on medical code sequences, pretrain
compute-optimal foundation models of up to 2.4 billion parameters, and finetune
them on clinician-curated cancer risk prediction cohorts. In our retrospective
evaluation comprising of thirty thousand patients, CATCH-FM achieved strong
efficacy (60% sensitivity) with low risk (99% specificity and Negative
Predictive Value), outperforming feature-based tree models as well as general
and medical large language models by large margins. Despite significant
demographic, healthcare system, and EHR coding differences, CATCH-FM achieves
state-of-the-art pancreatic cancer risk prediction on the EHRSHOT few-shot
leaderboard, outperforming EHR foundation models pretrained using on-site
patient data. Our analysis demonstrates the robustness of CATCH-FM in various
patient distributions, the benefits of operating in the ICD code space, and its
ability to capture non-trivial cancer risk factors. Our code will be
open-sourced.

TL;DR: LCR是一个实用的基于学习的GPU缓存框架，通过LARU算法增强LRU缓存策略，结合机器学习预测并动态适应预测准确性，在准确预测时实现接近最优性能，预测不准确时优雅降级到接近LRU性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU推理中缓存效率是主要瓶颈，推荐模型中的嵌入命中率和LLM中的KV缓存未命中严重影响性能。现有启发式策略如LRU在结构化访问模式下表现不佳，而基于学习的方法存在预测不准确时性能急剧下降或设计保守收益有限的问题。

Method: 提出LCR框架，核心算法LARU在LRU基础上集成机器学习预测，通过在线误差估计动态适应预测准确性。准确预测时实现接近最优性能，预测不准确时降级到LRU水平。

Result: 实验显示LCR在DLRM和LLM场景下，吞吐量提升最高24.2%，P99 TTFT降低最高28.3%，优于广泛使用的推理系统。即使在预测不佳时性能也保持稳定。

Conclusion: LCR框架成功弥合了基于学习的缓存方法在实证进展和理论进展之间的差距，提供了实用且稳健的GPU缓存解决方案。

Abstract: In modern GPU inference, cache efficiency remains a major bottleneck. In
recommendation models, embedding hit rates largely determine throughput, while
in large language models, KV-cache misses substantially increase
time-to-first-token (TTFT). Heuristic policies such as \textsc{LRU} often
struggle under structured access patterns. Learning-based approaches are
promising, but in practice face two major limitations: they degrade sharply
when predictions are inaccurate, or they gain little even with accurate
predictions due to conservative designs. Some also incur high overhead, further
limiting practicality.
  We present \textsc{LCR}, a practical framework for learning-based GPU caching
that delivers performance gains while ensuring robustness and efficiency. Its
core algorithm, \textsc{LARU}, enhances \textsc{LRU} with machine-learned
predictions and dynamically adapts to prediction accuracy through online error
estimation. When predictions are accurate, \textsc{LARU} achieves near-optimal
performance. With inaccurate predictions, it degrades gracefully to
near-\textsc{LRU} performance. With \textsc{LCR}, we bridge the gap between
empirical progress and theoretical advances in learning-based caching.
  Experiments show that \textsc{LCR} delivers consistent gains under realistic
conditions. In DLRM and LLM scenarios, it improves throughput by up to 24.2\%
and reduces P99 TTFT by up to 28.3\%, outperforming widely used inference
systems. Even under poor predictions, its performance remains stable,
demonstrating practical robustness.

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating inverse temperature parameter $\beta$
of an $n$-dimensional truncated Ising model using a single sample. Given a
graph $G = (V,E)$ with $n$ vertices, a truncated Ising model is a probability
distribution over the $n$-dimensional hypercube $\{-1,1\}^n$ where each
configuration $\mathbf{\sigma}$ is constrained to lie in a truncation set $S
\subseteq \{-1,1\}^n$ and has probability $\Pr(\mathbf{\sigma}) \propto
\exp(\beta\mathbf{\sigma}^\top A\mathbf{\sigma})$ with $A$ being the adjacency
matrix of $G$. We adopt the recent setting of [Galanis et al. SODA'24], where
the truncation set $S$ can be expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of
a $k$-SAT formula. Given a single sample $\mathbf{\sigma}$ from a truncated
Ising model, with inverse parameter $\beta^*$, underlying graph $G$ of bounded
degree $\Delta$ and $S$ being expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of
a $k$-SAT formula, we design in nearly $O(n)$ time an estimator $\hat{\beta}$
that is $O(\Delta^3/\sqrt{n})$-consistent with the true parameter $\beta^*$ for
$k \gtrsim \log(d^2k)\Delta^3.$
  Our estimator is based on the maximization of the pseudolikelihood, a notion
that has received extensive analysis for various probabilistic models without
[Chatterjee, Annals of Statistics '07] or with truncation [Galanis et al. SODA
'24]. Our approach generalizes recent techniques from [Daskalakis et al. STOC
'19, Galanis et al. SODA '24], to confront the more challenging setting of the
truncated Ising model.

Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖带有隐式正则化的自编码器，缺乏对全局稀疏性的显式保证，导致产生大量稠密特征，损害了特征的稀疏性和原子化程度。

Method: 提出二元自编码器（BAE），通过步进函数将隐藏激活离散化为1位，应用梯度估计实现反向传播，在隐藏激活的小批量上施加最小熵约束，促进特征独立性和跨实例的稀疏性。

Result: BAE在特征集熵计算和特征解缠两方面表现出色：能够可靠估计二元隐藏激活的熵来表征LLM推理动态；在特征提取方面避免了稠密特征，产生最多可解释特征。

Conclusion: BAE作为一种特征提取器具有有效性，能够有效解决现有特征解缠方法中的稠密特征问题，提升特征的稀疏性和可解释性。

Abstract: Existing works are dedicated to untangling atomized numerical components
(features) from the hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
interpreting their mechanism. However, they typically rely on autoencoders
constrained by some implicit training-time regularization on single training
instances (i.e., $L_1$ normalization, top-k function, etc.), without an
explicit guarantee of global sparsity among instances, causing a large amount
of dense (simultaneously inactive) features, harming the feature sparsity and
atomization. In this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder variant that
enforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations, thereby
promoting feature independence and sparsity across instances. For efficient
entropy calculation, we discretize the hidden activations to 1-bit via a step
function and apply gradient estimation to enable backpropagation, so that we
term it as Binary Autoencoder (BAE) and empirically demonstrate two major
applications: (1) Feature set entropy calculation. Entropy can be reliably
estimated on binary hidden activations, which we empirically evaluate and
leverage to characterize the inference dynamics of LLMs and In-context
Learning. (2) Feature untangling. Similar to typical methods, BAE can extract
atomized features from LLM's hidden states. To robustly evaluate such feature
extraction capability, we refine traditional feature-interpretation methods to
avoid unreliable handling of numerical tokens, and show that BAE avoids dense
features while producing the largest number of interpretable ones among
baselines, which confirms the effectiveness of BAE serving as a feature
extractor.

<details>

Motivation: 标准匿名GNN在ILP优化中表达能力有限，而全局唯一标识符（Global-UID）会引入虚假相关性，严重损害泛化能力

Method: 基于d-hop唯一性着色的局部UID方案，确保标识符仅在节点的d跳邻域内唯一。ColorGNN通过颜色条件嵌入整合颜色信息，ColorUID是轻量级特征级变体

Result: 实验显示该方法在三个ILP基准上取得显著增益，在线性规划数据集上表现出强OOD泛化能力，与最先进方法结合还能进一步提升图级任务性能

Conclusion: 局部UID方案在d层网络中能达到全局UID的表达能力，同时提供更强的泛化性能，有效解决了ILP优化中GNN的表达-泛化权衡问题

Abstract: Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) are central to real-world optimizations but
notoriously difficult to solve. Learning to Optimize (L2O) has emerged as a
promising paradigm, with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) serving as the standard
backbone. However, standard anonymous GNNs are limited in expressiveness for
ILPs, and the common enhancement of augmenting nodes with globally unique
identifiers (UIDs) typically introduces spurious correlations that severely
harm generalization. To address this tradeoff, we propose a parsimonious
Local-UID scheme based on d-hop uniqueness coloring, which ensures identifiers
are unique only within each node's d-hop neighborhood. Building on this scheme,
we introduce ColorGNN, which incorporates color information via
color-conditioned embeddings, and ColorUID, a lightweight feature-level
variant. We prove that for d-layer networks, Local-UIDs achieve the expressive
power of Global-UIDs while offering stronger generalization. Extensive
experiments show that our approach (i) yields substantial gains on three ILP
benchmarks, (ii) exhibits strong OOD generalization on linear programming
datasets, and (iii) further improves a general graph-level task when paired
with a state-of-the-art method.

Motivation: 传统时间序列模型评估主要关注四个典型任务（预测、填补、异常检测、分类），这些任务主要评估特定任务性能，无法严格衡量模型是否捕捉了数据的完整生成分布。

Method: 引入无损压缩作为评估范式，定义了标准化评估协议和指标，开发了TSCom-Bench评估框架，使时间序列模型能够快速适配为无损压缩的骨干网络。

Result: 在多个数据集上对TimeXer、iTransformer、PatchTST等最先进模型的实验表明，压缩能够揭示传统基准测试忽略的分布性弱点。

Conclusion: 无损压缩作为一个原则性任务，能够补充和扩展现有的时间序列建模评估方法。

Abstract: The evaluation of time series models has traditionally focused on four
canonical tasks: forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, and
classification. While these tasks have driven significant progress, they
primarily assess task-specific performance and do not rigorously measure
whether a model captures the full generative distribution of the data. We
introduce lossless compression as a new paradigm for evaluating time series
models, grounded in Shannon's source coding theorem. This perspective
establishes a direct equivalence between optimal compression length and the
negative log-likelihood, providing a strict and unified information-theoretic
criterion for modeling capacity. Then We define a standardized evaluation
protocol and metrics. We further propose and open-source a comprehensive
evaluation framework TSCom-Bench, which enables the rapid adaptation of time
series models as backbones for lossless compression. Experiments across diverse
datasets on state-of-the-art models, including TimeXer, iTransformer, and
PatchTST, demonstrate that compression reveals distributional weaknesses
overlooked by classic benchmarks. These findings position lossless compression
as a principled task that complements and extends existing evaluation for time
series modeling.

Abstract: Flight trajectory prediction for multiple aircraft is essential and provides
critical insights into how aircraft navigate within current air traffic flows.
However, predicting multi-agent flight trajectories is inherently challenging.
One of the major difficulties is modeling both the individual aircraft
behaviors over time and the complex interactions between flights. Generating
explainable prediction outcomes is also a challenge. Therefore, we propose a
Multi-Agent Inverted Transformer, MAIFormer, as a novel neural architecture
that predicts multi-agent flight trajectories. The proposed framework features
two key attention modules: (i) masked multivariate attention, which captures
spatio-temporal patterns of individual aircraft, and (ii) agent attention,
which models the social patterns among multiple agents in complex air traffic
scenes. We evaluated MAIFormer using a real-world automatic dependent
surveillance-broadcast flight trajectory dataset from the terminal airspace of
Incheon International Airport in South Korea. The experimental results show
that MAIFormer achieves the best performance across multiple metrics and
outperforms other methods. In addition, MAIFormer produces prediction outcomes
that are interpretable from a human perspective, which improves both the
transparency of the model and its practical utility in air traffic control.

Abstract: The generation of high-quality candidate molecules remains a central
challenge in AI-driven drug design. Current phenotype-based and target-based
strategies each suffer limitations, either incurring high experimental costs or
overlook system-level cellular responses. To bridge this gap, we propose
ExMoIRL, a novel generative framework that synergistically integrates
phenotypic and target-specific cues for de novo molecular generation. The
phenotype-guided generator is first pretrained on expansive drug-induced
transcriptional profiles and subsequently fine-tuned via multi-objective
reinforcement learning (RL). Crucially, the reward function fuses docking
affinity and drug-likeness scores, augmented with ranking loss,
prior-likelihood regularization, and entropy maximization. The multi-objective
RL steers the model toward chemotypes that are simultaneously potent, diverse,
and aligned with the specified phenotypic effects. Extensive experiments
demonstrate ExMoIRL's superior performance over state-of-the-art
phenotype-based and target-based models across multiple well-characterized
targets. Our generated molecules exhibit favorable drug-like properties, high
target affinity, and inhibitory potency (IC50) against cancer cells. This
unified framework showcases the synergistic potential of combining
phenotype-guided and target-aware strategies, offering a more effective
solution for de novo drug discovery.

TL;DR: 本文通过信息移除的新视角研究In-context Learning(ICL)机制，发现零样本情况下语言模型生成非选择性表示，而少样本ICL通过选择性移除冗余信息模拟任务导向的信息移除过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL作为一种新兴的少样本学习范式，其内部机制尚不明确，需要从新的角度进行深入探究。

Method: 采用信息移除视角，通过低秩滤波器从隐藏状态中选择性移除特定信息，并设计指标测量隐藏状态变化，识别关键的Denoising Heads进行消融实验。

Result: 发现ICL通过选择性信息移除机制有效引导语言模型聚焦目标任务，阻断信息移除操作会显著降低ICL准确率，特别是在正确标签缺失的情况下。

Conclusion: 信息移除机制是ICL的关键机制，Denoising Heads在实现这一过程中发挥重要作用。

Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) is an emerging few-shot learning paradigm based on
modern Language Models (LMs), yet its inner mechanism remains unclear. In this
paper, we investigate the mechanism through a novel perspective of information
removal. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the zero-shot scenario, LMs
encode queries into non-selective representations in hidden states containing
information for all possible tasks, leading to arbitrary outputs without
focusing on the intended task, resulting in near-zero accuracy. Meanwhile, we
find that selectively removing specific information from hidden states by a
low-rank filter effectively steers LMs toward the intended task. Building on
these findings, by measuring the hidden states on carefully designed metrics,
we observe that few-shot ICL effectively simulates such task-oriented
information removal processes, selectively removing the redundant information
from entangled non-selective representations, and improving the output based on
the demonstrations, which constitutes a key mechanism underlying ICL. Moreover,
we identify essential attention heads inducing the removal operation, termed
Denoising Heads, which enables the ablation experiments blocking the
information removal operation from the inference, where the ICL accuracy
significantly degrades, especially when the correct label is absent from the
few-shot demonstrations, confirming both the critical role of the information
removal mechanism and denoising heads.

### [230] [Predicting LLM Reasoning Performance with Small Proxy Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21013)
*Woosung Koh,Juyoung Suk,Sungjun Han,Se-Young Yun,Jay Shin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: rBridge是一种方法，通过使用小模型（≤1B参数）来预测大模型（1B-32B）的推理能力，通过将负对数似然与任务对齐加权，利用前沿模型的推理轨迹作为黄金标签，显著降低了数据集排序成本（超过100倍），并在多个推理基准上实现了最强的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练大型语言模型的成本过高，需要利用小模型来优化数据集，但推理能力通常只在较大模型（超过7B参数）中可靠出现，这使得小模型难以有效预测大模型的推理性能。

Method: rBridge通过加权负对数似然与任务对齐，使用前沿模型的推理轨迹作为黄金标签，使小代理模型更接近预训练目标和目标任务，从而有效预测大模型的推理能力。

Result: rBridge在实验中（i）将数据集排序成本降低了超过100倍；（ii）在1B到32B规模的六个推理基准上实现了最强的相关性；（iii）在1B到7B规模上实现了预测关系的零样本跨预训练数据集迁移。

Conclusion: rBridge为以较低成本探索面向推理的预训练提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Given the prohibitive cost of pre-training large language models, it is
essential to leverage smaller proxy models to optimize datasets before scaling
up. However, this approach becomes challenging for reasoning capabilities,
which exhibit emergent behavior that only appear reliably at larger model
sizes, often exceeding 7B parameters. To address this, we introduce rBridge,
showing that small proxies ($\leq$1B) can effectively predict large-model
reasoning by aligning more closely with (1) the pre-training objective and (2)
the target task. rBridge achieves this by weighting negative log-likelihood
with task alignment, using reasoning traces from frontier models as gold
labels. In our experiments, rBridge (i) reduces dataset ranking costs by over
100x relative to the best baseline, (ii) achieves the strongest correlation
across six reasoning benchmarks at 1B to 32B scale, and (iii) zero-shot
transfers predictive relationships across pre-training datasets at 1B to 7B
scale. These findings indicate that rBridge offers a practical path for
exploring reasoning-oriented pre-training at lower cost.

TL;DR: DELTA-Code是一个用于评估LLMs学习能力和迁移能力的合成编码基准，通过控制实验探究LLMs能否通过强化学习获得新的推理策略，并测试这些技能在分布外测试集上的迁移能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs是否能够真正获得或泛化新的推理策略这一开放性问题，而不是仅仅依赖预训练或后训练中编码的已有技能。

Method: 设计DELTA-Code基准，包含模板化问题生成器和完全分布外的问题家族，通过强化学习训练模型，探索阶段性预热、经验回放、课程训练等关键训练要素。

Result: 发现明显的顿悟相变现象：模型在经历长时间接近零奖励后突然达到接近完美的准确率。在家族内部和重组技能上表现良好，但在变换性案例中存在持续弱点。

Conclusion: DELTA为探测RL驱动推理的极限提供了干净的测试平台，有助于理解模型如何超越现有先验来获得新的算法技能。

Abstract: It remains an open question whether LLMs can acquire or generalize genuinely
new reasoning strategies, beyond the sharpened skills encoded in their
parameters during pre-training or post-training. To attempt to answer this
debate, we introduce DELTA-Code--Distributional Evaluation of Learnability and
Transferrability in Algorithmic Coding, a controlled benchmark of synthetic
coding problem families designed to probe two fundamental aspects: learnability
-- can LLMs, through reinforcement learning (RL), solve problem families where
pretrained models exhibit failure with large enough attempts (pass@K=0)? --and
transferrability -- if learnability happens, can such skills transfer
systematically to out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets? Unlike prior public
coding datasets, DELTA isolates reasoning skills through templated problem
generators and introduces fully OOD problem families that demand novel
strategies rather than tool invocation or memorized patterns. Our experiments
reveal a striking grokking phase transition: after an extended period with
near-zero reward, RL-trained models abruptly climb to near-perfect accuracy. To
enable learnability on previously unsolvable problem families, we explore key
training ingredients such as staged warm-up with dense rewards, experience
replay, curriculum training, and verification-in-the-loop. Beyond learnability,
we use DELTA to evaluate transferability or generalization along exploratory,
compositional, and transformative axes, as well as cross-family transfer.
Results show solid gains within families and for recomposed skills, but
persistent weaknesses in transformative cases. DELTA thus offers a clean
testbed for probing the limits of RL-driven reasoning and for understanding how
models can move beyond existing priors to acquire new algorithmic skills.

### [232] [Efficient Ensemble Conditional Independence Test Framework for Causal Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21021)
*Zhengkang Guan,Kun Kuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Ensemble Conditional Independence Test (E-CIT)框架，通过数据划分和p值聚合策略，显著降低条件独立性测试的计算复杂度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于约束的因果发现中条件独立性测试计算成本过高的问题，特别是当样本量较大时测试的时间复杂度成为主要瓶颈

Method: 采用分治策略：将数据划分为子集，在每个子集上独立应用基础CIT，然后使用基于稳定分布特性的新方法聚合p值

Result: E-CIT将基础CIT的计算复杂度降低到样本大小的线性级别，在保持理论一致性的同时显著减少了计算负担

Conclusion: E-CIT不仅大幅降低了CIT和因果发现的计算成本，而且在复杂测试场景下表现出竞争力，特别是在真实数据集上效果更佳

Abstract: Constraint-based causal discovery relies on numerous conditional independence
tests (CITs), but its practical applicability is severely constrained by the
prohibitive computational cost, especially as CITs themselves have high time
complexity with respect to the sample size. To address this key bottleneck, we
introduce the Ensemble Conditional Independence Test (E-CIT), a general and
plug-and-play framework. E-CIT operates on an intuitive divide-and-aggregate
strategy: it partitions the data into subsets, applies a given base CIT
independently to each subset, and aggregates the resulting p-values using a
novel method grounded in the properties of stable distributions. This framework
reduces the computational complexity of a base CIT to linear in the sample size
when the subset size is fixed. Moreover, our tailored p-value combination
method offers theoretical consistency guarantees under mild conditions on the
subtests. Experimental results demonstrate that E-CIT not only significantly
reduces the computational burden of CITs and causal discovery but also achieves
competitive performance. Notably, it exhibits an improvement in complex testing
scenarios, particularly on real-world datasets.

TL;DR: 提出Actor-Critic without Actor (ACA)框架，消除显式actor网络，直接从噪声级critic的梯度场生成动作，简化架构并提升效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统actor-critic方法依赖分离的actor和critic网络，训练复杂且对架构决策敏感；扩散模型虽能表达多模态行为但引入额外设计负担

Method: 通过噪声级critic的梯度场直接生成动作，无需显式actor网络，保持策略改进与critic最新价值估计紧密对齐

Result: 在标准在线RL基准测试中，ACA相比标准actor-critic和扩散方法获得更优学习曲线和竞争性能

Conclusion: ACA提供简单而强大的在线RL解决方案，结合简洁性与表达性，无需扩散actor即可捕获多样化多模态行为

Abstract: Actor-critic methods constitute a central paradigm in reinforcement learning
(RL), coupling policy evaluation with policy improvement. While effective
across many domains, these methods rely on separate actor and critic networks,
which makes training vulnerable to architectural decisions and hyperparameter
tuning. Such complexity limits their scalability in settings that require large
function approximators. Recently, diffusion models have recently been proposed
as expressive policies that capture multi-modal behaviors and improve
exploration, but they introduce additional design choices and computational
burdens, hindering efficient deployment. We introduce Actor-Critic without
Actor (ACA), a lightweight framework that eliminates the explicit actor network
and instead generates actions directly from the gradient field of a noise-level
critic. This design removes the algorithmic and computational overhead of actor
training while keeping policy improvement tightly aligned with the critic's
latest value estimates. Moreover, ACA retains the ability to capture diverse,
multi-modal behaviors without relying on diffusion-based actors, combining
simplicity with expressiveness. Through extensive experiments on standard
online RL benchmarks,ACA achieves more favorable learning curves and
competitive performance compared to both standard actor-critic and
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods, providing a simple yet powerful
solution for online RL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中视觉越狱攻击的局限性，发现现有攻击方法存在高锐度区域问题，导致跨模型迁移性差。作者提出了FORCE方法，通过纠正特征过度依赖问题来提升攻击的跨模型迁移能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉越狱攻击虽然能有效攻击开源MLLMs，但在跨模型迁移到闭源模型时效果不佳。作者旨在理解这种迁移性差的原因，并开发能有效评估闭源MLLMs安全性的方法。

Method: 作者分析了攻击的损失景观和特征表示，发现攻击过度依赖特定层特征和语义贫乏的频率分量。基于此提出了FORCE方法，通过引导攻击探索更广泛的可行区域，并根据语义内容重新调整频率特征的影响。

Result: 实验证明FORCE方法能有效发现平坦的可行区域，显著提升视觉越狱攻击的跨模型迁移性，为闭源MLLMs的红队评估提供了有效工具。

Conclusion: 通过消除对层和频谱特征的非泛化依赖，FORCE方法成功解决了视觉越狱攻击迁移性差的问题，为MLLMs的安全性评估提供了重要贡献。

Abstract: The integration of new modalities enhances the capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) but also introduces additional vulnerabilities.
In particular, simple visual jailbreaking attacks can manipulate open-source
MLLMs more readily than sophisticated textual attacks. However, these
underdeveloped attacks exhibit extremely limited cross-model transferability,
failing to reliably identify vulnerabilities in closed-source MLLMs. In this
work, we analyse the loss landscape of these jailbreaking attacks and find that
the generated attacks tend to reside in high-sharpness regions, whose
effectiveness is highly sensitive to even minor parameter changes during
transfer. To further explain the high-sharpness localisations, we analyse their
feature representations in both the intermediate layers and the spectral
domain, revealing an improper reliance on narrow layer representations and
semantically poor frequency components. Building on this, we propose a Feature
Over-Reliance CorrEction (FORCE) method, which guides the attack to explore
broader feasible regions across layer features and rescales the influence of
frequency features according to their semantic content. By eliminating
non-generalizable reliance on both layer and spectral features, our method
discovers flattened feasible regions for visual jailbreaking attacks, thereby
improving cross-model transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach effectively facilitates visual red-teaming evaluations against
closed-source MLLMs.

*Honglin Zhang,Qianyue Hao,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究通过边缘归因修补方法分析RL微调对LLM内部机制的影响，发现在线RL训练会增强激活强度和多样性，而DPO方法则表现出不一致的内部变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RL微调被证明能提升LLM能力，但其对不同LLM内部机制的具体影响机制尚不明确，需要系统性的内部分析。

Method: 采用边缘归因修补(EAP)技术，对比分析多个模型家族在RL微调前后的内部激活模式和信号强度变化。

Result: 在线RL训练导致：(i)整体激活强度增加，表明更多内部通路被激活；(ii)激活模式多样性提高，表现为更高熵值和更分散的边缘分布。DPO方法的变化则较弱或不一致。

Conclusion: RL微调通过重塑信息流使其更具冗余性和灵活性，从而提升泛化能力。在线RL与基于偏好的方法在内部机制上存在显著差异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire extensive prior knowledge through
large-scale pretraining and can be further enhanced via supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training. A growing body of
evidence has shown that RL fine-tuning improves the capability of LLMs beyond
what SFT alone achieves. However, the underlying mechanisms why RL fine-tuning
is able to enhance the capability of various LLMs with distinct intrinsic
characteristics remain underexplored. In this study, we draw inspiration from
prior work on edge attribution patching (EAP) to investigate the internal
differences of LLMs before and after RL fine-tuning. Our analysis across
multiple model families shows two robust effects of online RL post-training:
(i) an overall increase in activation intensity, indicating that more internal
pathways are engaged and their signals become stronger, and (ii) greater
diversity in activation patterns, reflected by higher entropy and less
concentrated edge distributions. These changes suggest that RL reshapes
information flow to be both more redundant and more flexible, which may explain
its advantage in generalization. Notably, models fine-tuned with Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) deviate from these trends, exhibiting
substantially weaker or inconsistent internal changes compared to PPO- and
GRPO-based training. Together, our findings provide a unified view of how RL
fine-tuning systematically alters the internal circuitry of LLMs and highlight
the methodological distinctions between online RL and preference-based
approaches. Our code is open source at

Adam optimizer in generative models from first principles, i.e., the Learning
$\textit{Lagrangian}$. We postulate that learning searches for stationary paths
in the Lagrangian, and learning algorithms are derivable by seeking the
stationary trajectories.

TL;DR: ScaleDiff是一个简单有效的管道，用于大规模创建困难数学问题，通过自适应思维模型识别现有数据集中的难题，训练专门的难题生成器，显著提升模型在数学推理任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在自动合成数学问题时面临高计算成本、复杂提示和生成问题难度有限的挑战，需要一种更高效的方法来扩展困难问题的创建。

Method: 提出ScaleDiff管道：1）使用自适应思维模型单次前向传播识别现有数据集中的困难问题；2）在筛选的困难数据上训练专门的难题生成器（DiffGen-8B），无需复杂提示和高API成本。

Result: 在ScaleDiff-Math数据集上微调Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct，相比原始数据集性能提升11.3%，在AIME'24等五个困难基准上达到65.9%平均准确率，优于OpenThinker3等强模型。

Conclusion: ScaleDiff能够有效转移高级推理能力，无需依赖更大更昂贵的教师模型，并观察到随着困难问题数量增加，模型在困难基准上的性能呈现明显的缩放现象。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive capabilities in complex
problem-solving, often benefiting from training on difficult mathematical
problems that stimulate intricate reasoning. Recent efforts have explored
automated synthesis of mathematical problems by prompting proprietary models or
large-scale open-source models from seed data or inherent mathematical
concepts. However, scaling up these methods remains challenging due to their
high computational/API cost, complexity of prompting, and limited difficulty
level of the generated problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose
ScaleDiff, a simple yet effective pipeline designed to scale the creation of
difficult problems. We efficiently identify difficult problems from existing
datasets with only a single forward pass using an adaptive thinking model,
which can perceive problem difficulty and automatically switch between
"Thinking" and "NoThinking" modes. We then train a specialized difficult
problem generator (DiffGen-8B) on this filtered difficult data, which can
produce new difficult problems in large scale, eliminating the need for
complex, per-instance prompting and its associated high API costs. Fine-tuning
Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on the ScaleDiff-Math dataset yields a substantial
performance increase of 11.3% compared to the original dataset and achieves a
65.9% average accuracy on AIME'24, AIME'25, HMMT-Feb'25, BRUMO'25, and MATH500,
outperforming recent strong LRMs like OpenThinker3. Notably, this performance
is achieved using the cost-efficient Qwen3-8B model as a teacher, demonstrating
that our pipeline can effectively transfer advanced reasoning capabilities
without relying on larger, more expensive teacher models. Furthermore, we
observe a clear scaling phenomenon in model performance on difficult benchmarks
as the quantity of difficult problems increases. Code:

Motivation: 几何问题求解需要准确的图解理解和跨模态对齐能力，但目前缺乏专门评估模型在几何图解中定位几何元素能力的方法，因此需要建立专门的基准任务。

Method: 从现有几何问题语料库构建GeoRef数据集，使用结构化几何形式语言生成大规模合成训练数据，采用监督微调和GRPO两种微调方法，并提出验证-再生机制来检测和修正错误预测。

Result: GRPO方法显著优于监督微调，能更好地将模型行为与任务特定奖励对齐。验证-再生机制进一步提升了准确率。在GeoRef上训练的模型在下游几何推理任务中表现出可测量的改进。

Conclusion: 几何指称表达理解是几何问题求解的关键基础能力，当前最先进的多模态大语言模型在此任务上仍有困难，需要专门评估和加强几何基础能力。REC任务对多模态数学理解具有广泛价值。

Abstract: AI-driven geometric problem solving is a complex vision-language task that
requires accurate diagram interpretation, mathematical reasoning, and robust
cross-modal grounding. A foundational yet underexplored capability for this
task is the ability to identify and interpret geometric elements based on
natural language queries. To address this, we introduce the task of Referring
Expression Comprehension (REC) for geometric problems, which evaluates whether
models can localize points, shapes, and spatial relations in diagrams in
response to textual prompts. We present GeoRef, a benchmark dataset constructed
from existing geometric problem corpora, featuring diverse, high-quality
annotations and queries. Due to the lack of annotated data for this task, we
generate a large-scale synthetic training dataset using a structured geometric
formal language, enabling broad coverage of geometric concepts and facilitating
model adaptation. We explore two fine-tuning approaches: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our results show that GRPO
significantly outperforms SFT by better aligning model behavior with
task-specific rewards. Furthermore, we propose a verify-and-regenerate
mechanism that detects incorrect predictions and re-infers answers using
contextual reasoning history, further boosting accuracy. Notably, even
state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with this
task, underscoring the necessity of explicitly evaluating and strengthening
geometric grounding as a prerequisite for robust geometric problem solving.
Moreover, models trained on GeoRef demonstrate measurable improvements on
downstream geometric reasoning tasks, highlighting the broader value of REC as
a foundation for multimodal mathematical understanding.

Motivation: 开发高效的多目标优化方法来计算冲突目标之间的帕累托最优折衷集仍然是一个关键挑战，特别是对于大规模和计算代价高的问题。

Method: SPREAD首先学习决策空间采样点的条件扩散过程，然后在每个反向扩散步骤中，通过自适应多梯度下降更新和基于高斯RBF的排斥项来优化候选解，实现快速收敛和多样性保持。

Conclusion: SPREAD框架成功地将扩散模型应用于多目标优化，为解决大规模复杂优化问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Developing efficient multi-objective optimization methods to compute the
Pareto set of optimal compromises between conflicting objectives remains a key
challenge, especially for large-scale and expensive problems. To bridge this
gap, we introduce SPREAD, a generative framework based on Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). SPREAD first learns a conditional diffusion
process over points sampled from the decision space and then, at each reverse
diffusion step, refines candidates via a sampling scheme that uses an adaptive
multiple gradient descent-inspired update for fast convergence alongside a
Gaussian RBF-based repulsion term for diversity. Empirical results on
multi-objective optimization benchmarks, including offline and Bayesian
surrogate-based settings, show that SPREAD matches or exceeds leading baselines
in efficiency, scalability, and Pareto front coverage.

Result: 在9对公开跨域数据集上的实验表明，SATMC在跨网络节点分类任务中优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: 理论证明SATMC能够实现比现有图域自适应方法更紧的跨网络节点分类误差界，实验验证了其有效性

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation has gained significant attention in label-scarce
scenarios across different graph domains. Traditional approaches to graph
domain adaptation primarily focus on transforming node attributes over raw
graph structures and aligning the distributions of the transformed node
features across networks. However, these methods often struggle with the
underlying structural heterogeneity between distinct graph domains, which leads
to suboptimal distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose
Structure-Attribute Transformation with Markov Chain (SATMC), a novel framework
that sequentially aligns distributions across networks via both graph structure
and attribute transformations. To mitigate the negative influence of
domain-private information and further enhance the model's generalization,
SATMC introduces a private domain information reduction mechanism and an
empirical Wasserstein distance. Theoretical proofs suggest that SATMC can
achieve a tighter error bound for cross-network node classification compared to
existing graph domain adaptation methods. Extensive experiments on nine pairs
of publicly available cross-domain datasets show that SATMC outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in the cross-network node classification task. The

TL;DR: TyphoonMLA是一种混合注意力机制，结合了naive和absorb两种方法，在MLA架构中提升注意力计算吞吐量3倍以上


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLA解码内核使用absorb方法虽然减少了HBM带宽使用，但无法利用注意力计算中的数据重用机会（如共享前缀），限制了性能提升

Method: 提出混合方法：对注意力计算的计算密集型部分使用naive公式来利用共享前缀，对非共享部分使用absorb公式来减少带宽需求

Result: 在NPU和GPU上分别实现3倍和3.24倍的注意力计算吞吐量提升，HBM大小仅增加3%

Conclusion: TyphoonMLA成功结合了两种方法的优势，为MLA架构提供了高效的注意力计算解决方案

Abstract: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) is a recent attention mechanism adopted in
state-of-the-art LLMs such as DeepSeek-v3 and Kimi K2. Thanks to its novel
formulation, MLA allows two functionally equivalent but computationally
distinct kernel implementations: naive and absorb. While the naive kernels
(e.g., FlashAttention) are typically preferred in training and prefill for
their computational efficiency, existing decoding kernels (e.g., FlashMLA) rely
on the absorb method to minimize HBM bandwidth usage. However, the
compute-bound nature of the absorb implementations prohibits performance
benefits from data reuse opportunities in attention calculations, such as
shared prefixes. In this work, we introduce TyphoonMLA, a hybrid approach that
combines naive and absorb formulations to harness the strengths of both.
TyphoonMLA effectively leverages the shared prefix by applying the naive
formulation to the compute-bound parts of attention calculations, while
reducing the bandwidth requirements for non-shared parts by using the absorb
formulation. As a result, TyphoonMLA improves the throughput of attention
calculations in MLA architectures by up to 3x and 3.24x on NPU and GPUs, with
only a 3% overhead in HBM size.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in graph learning is understanding how models
generalize to new, unseen graphs. While synthetic benchmarks offer controlled

transductive settings where models train and test on the same graph structure.
Addressing this gap, we introduce GraphUniverse, a framework for generating
entire families of graphs to enable the first systematic evaluation of
inductive generalization at scale. Our core innovation is the generation of
graphs with persistent semantic communities, ensuring conceptual consistency
while allowing fine-grained control over structural properties like homophily
and degree distributions. This enables crucial but underexplored robustness
tests, such as performance under controlled distribution shifts. Benchmarking a
wide range of architectures -- from GNNs to graph transformers and topological
architectures -- reveals that strong transductive performance is a poor
predictor of inductive generalization. Furthermore, we find that robustness to
distribution shift is highly sensitive not only to model architecture choice
but also to the initial graph regime (e.g., high vs. low homophily). Beyond
benchmarking, GraphUniverse's flexibility and scalability can facilitate the
development of robust and truly generalizable architectures -- including
next-generation graph foundation models. An interactive demo is available at

### [243] [Teaching RL Agents to Act Better: VLM as Action Advisor for Online Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21126)
*Xiefeng Wu,Jing Zhao,Shu Zhang,Mingyu Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VARL是一个利用视觉语言模型为强化学习代理提供动作建议的框架，通过增加样本多样性来提高样本效率，特别是在稀疏奖励任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线强化学习在复杂任务中需要大量交互步骤，而现有的视觉语言动作策略在低层控制方面性能有限，且需要任务特定的专家演示进行微调。

Method: VARL框架利用视觉语言模型的领域知识为强化学习代理提供动作建议，而不是设计启发式奖励，从而保证最优性和收敛性不变。

Result: 实验结果表明，VARL显著提高了样本效率，且没有引入显著的计算开销。

Conclusion: VARL是一个通用的在线强化学习框架，使得在真实世界环境中直接从零开始应用强化学习变得可行。

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning in complex tasks is time-consuming, as massive
interaction steps are needed to learn the optimal Q-function.Vision-language
action (VLA) policies represent a promising direction for solving diverse
tasks; however, their performance on low-level control remains limited, and
effective deployment often requires task-specific expert demonstrations for
fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose \textbf{VARL} (\textbf{V}LM as
\textbf{A}ction advisor for online \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning), a
framework that leverages the domain knowledge of vision-language models (VLMs)
to provide action suggestions for reinforcement learning agents. Unlike
previous methods, VARL provides action suggestions rather than designing
heuristic rewards, thereby guaranteeing unchanged optimality and convergence.
The suggested actions increase sample diversity and ultimately improve sample
efficiency, especially in sparse-reward tasks. To validate the effectiveness of
VARL, we evaluate it across diverse environments and agent settings. Results
show that VARL greatly improves sample efficiency without introducing
significant computational overhead. These advantages make VARL a general
framework for online reinforcement learning and make it feasible to directly
apply reinforcement learning from scratch in real-world environments.

*Wei Huang,De-Tian Chu,Lin-Yuan Bai,Wei Kang,Hai-Tao Zhang,Bo Li,Zhi-Mo Han,Jing Ge,Hai-Feng Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EvoMail是一个自演进的认知代理框架，通过构建统一的异构邮件图，结合认知图神经网络和大型语言模型进行上下文感知推理，并通过红蓝对抗自进化循环持续适应新型垃圾邮件和钓鱼攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代垃圾邮件和钓鱼攻击已超越传统关键词黑名单和简单启发式方法，采用多模态策略结合自然语言文本、混淆URL、伪造头部和恶意附件，传统基于静态规则或单模态模型的检测系统难以整合异构信号和持续适应。

Method: 构建统一的异构邮件图融合文本内容、元数据和嵌入资源；使用认知图神经网络增强大型语言模型进行上下文感知推理；采用红蓝对抗自进化循环，红队生成新型规避策略，蓝队从失败中学习并压缩经验到记忆模块。

Result: 在真实数据集（Enron-Spam、Ling-Spam、SpamAssassin、TREC）和合成对抗变体上的实验表明，EvoMail在检测准确性、对演进垃圾邮件策略的适应性和推理可解释性方面持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: EvoMail作为对抗下一代垃圾邮件和钓鱼威胁的弹性和可解释防御框架具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Modern email spam and phishing attacks have evolved far beyond keyword
blacklists or simple heuristics. Adversaries now craft multi-modal campaigns
that combine natural-language text with obfuscated URLs, forged headers, and
malicious attachments, adapting their strategies within days to bypass filters.
Traditional spam detection systems, which rely on static rules or
single-modality models, struggle to integrate heterogeneous signals or to
continuously adapt, leading to rapid performance degradation.
  We propose EvoMail, a self-evolving cognitive agent framework for robust
detection of spam and phishing. EvoMail first constructs a unified
heterogeneous email graph that fuses textual content, metadata (headers,
senders, domains), and embedded resources (URLs, attachments). A Cognitive
Graph Neural Network enhanced by a Large Language Model (LLM) performs
context-aware reasoning across these sources to identify coordinated spam
campaigns. Most critically, EvoMail engages in an adversarial self-evolution
loop: a ''red-team'' agent generates novel evasion tactics -- such as character
obfuscation or AI-generated phishing text -- while the ''blue-team'' detector
learns from failures, compresses experiences into a memory module, and reuses
them for future reasoning.
  Extensive experiments on real-world datasets (Enron-Spam, Ling-Spam,
SpamAssassin, and TREC) and synthetic adversarial variants demonstrate that
EvoMail consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection
accuracy, adaptability to evolving spam tactics, and interpretability of
reasoning traces. These results highlight EvoMail's potential as a resilient
and explainable defense framework against next-generation spam and phishing
threats.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用稀疏主成分分析（SPCA）作为对抗性攻击的防御方法，通过理论分析和实验验证表明SPCA比标准PCA在保持准确性的同时具有更好的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在图像分类任务中表现出色，但对精心设计的对抗性扰动仍然脆弱。本研究重新审视线性降维作为一种简单、数据自适应的防御方法。

Method: 经验比较标准PCA与其稀疏变体SPCA作为前端特征提取器，配合下游分类器进行实验，并进行理论分析。理论方面推导了SPCA特征的精确鲁棒性证书，并证明稀疏性通过Lipschitz组合参数降低算子范数界限。

Result: 实验表明，在强白盒和黑盒攻击下，SPCA比PCA具有更优雅的性能下降，同时保持竞争力的干净准确率。

Conclusion: 理论识别了稀疏投影减少对抗性杠杆的机制，实验验证了这种优势在线性设置之外仍然存在。

Abstract: Deep neural networks perform remarkably well on image classification tasks
but remain vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial perturbations. This work
revisits linear dimensionality reduction as a simple, data-adapted defense. We
empirically compare standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with its sparse
variant (SPCA) as front-end feature extractors for downstream classifiers, and
we complement these experiments with a theoretical analysis. On the theory
side, we derive exact robustness certificates for linear heads applied to SPCA
features: for both $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$ threat models (binary and
multiclass), the certified radius grows as the dual norms of $W^\top u$ shrink,
where $W$ is the projection and $u$ the head weights. We further show that for
general (non-linear) heads, sparsity reduces operator-norm bounds through a
Lipschitz composition argument, predicting lower input sensitivity.
Empirically, with a small non-linear network after the projection, SPCA
consistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and
black-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy. Taken together,
the theory identifies the mechanism (sparser projections reduce adversarial
leverage) and the experiments verify that this benefit persists beyond the
linear setting. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了LAVA方法，用于解释无监督黑盒模型的潜在空间结构，通过分析局部邻域内的特征相关性来揭示输入特征与嵌入空间组织之间的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督黑盒模型虽然能驱动科学发现，但难以解释。现有解释方法要么过于细粒度（单样本级别），要么过于简化（数据集级别），缺乏基于潜在空间邻近性的自动化策略来关联相似样本。

Method: LAVA是一种后处理、模型无关的方法，将潜在空间表示为一系列局部邻域，通过原始特征之间的相关性来描述这些邻域，然后揭示整个潜在空间中重复出现的相关性模式。

Result: 基于MNIST和单细胞肾脏数据集的UMAP嵌入，LAVA能够捕捉相关的特征关联，在看似遥远的潜在空间区域之间发现视觉和生物学上相关的局部模式。

Conclusion: LAVA方法能够有效解释无监督学习模型的局部嵌入组织，为理解黑盒模型的潜在空间结构提供了新的工具。

Abstract: Unsupervised black-box models can be drivers of scientific discovery, but
remain difficult to interpret. Crucially, discovery hinges on understanding the
model output, which is often a multi-dimensional latent embedding rather than a
well-defined target. While explainability for supervised learning usually seeks
to uncover how input features are used to predict a target, its unsupervised
counterpart should relate input features to the structure of the learned latent
space. Adaptations of supervised model explainability for unsupervised learning
provide either single-sample or dataset-wide summary explanations. However,
without automated strategies of relating similar samples to one another guided
by their latent proximity, explanations remain either too fine-grained or too
reductive to be meaningful. This is especially relevant for manifold learning
methods that produce no mapping function, leaving us only with the relative
spatial organization of their embeddings. We introduce Locality-Aware Variable
Associations (LAVA), a post-hoc model-agnostic method designed to explain local
embedding organization through its relationship with the input features. To
achieve this, LAVA represents the latent space as a series of localities
(neighborhoods) described in terms of correlations between the original
features, and then reveals reoccurring patterns of correlations across the
entire latent space. Based on UMAP embeddings of MNIST and a single-cell kidney
dataset, we show that LAVA captures relevant feature associations, with
visually and biologically relevant local patterns shared among seemingly
distant regions of the latent spaces.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出CAD-Tokenizer，一种针对CAD序列的多模态标记化框架，通过基于序列的VQ-VAE和原始级池化来解决传统LLM标记器在CAD语义表示上的不足，显著提升了文本引导CAD原型设计的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大型语言模型的标记器将CAD构造序列分解为自然语言词片段，无法捕捉原始级CAD语义，阻碍了几何结构建模。需要一种与CAD原始和结构特性对齐的多模态标记化策略。

Method: 提出CAD-Tokenizer框架，使用基于序列的VQ-VAE，结合原始级池化和约束解码，生成紧凑的、原始感知的CAD数据表示。

Result: 在统一的文本引导CAD原型设计中，CAD-Tokenizer显著改善了指令遵循和生成质量，在定量和定性评估上都优于通用LLM和任务特定基线。

Conclusion: 多模态标记化策略能够有效表示CAD数据的结构特性，为文本引导的CAD设计和编辑提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a foundational component of industrial
prototyping, where models are defined not by raw coordinates but by
construction sequences such as sketches and extrusions. This sequential
structure enables both efficient prototype initialization and subsequent
editing. Text-guided CAD prototyping, which unifies Text-to-CAD generation and
CAD editing, has the potential to streamline the entire design pipeline.
However, prior work has not explored this setting, largely because standard
large language model (LLM) tokenizers decompose CAD sequences into
natural-language word pieces, failing to capture primitive-level CAD semantics
and hindering attention modules from modeling geometric structure. We
conjecture that a multimodal tokenization strategy, aligned with CAD's
primitive and structural nature, can provide more effective representations. To
this end, we propose CAD-Tokenizer, a framework that represents CAD data with
modality-specific tokens using a sequence-based VQ-VAE with primitive-level
pooling and constrained decoding. This design produces compact, primitive-aware
representations that align with CAD's structural nature. Applied to unified
text-guided CAD prototyping, CAD-Tokenizer significantly improves instruction
following and generation quality, achieving better quantitative and qualitative
performance over both general-purpose LLMs and task-specific baselines.

*Michael Sullivan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文证明了GRPO强化学习算法在特定条件下会诱导出非平凡的过程奖励模型，并提出了改进算法λ-GRPO来提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索GRPO算法中隐含的过程奖励模型特性，并解决其目标函数中存在的缺陷，以降低训练成本并提升模型性能。

Method: 首先理论证明GRPO诱导过程奖励模型的条件，然后通过实证验证这些条件在现实场景中成立。基于此发现，提出了λ-GRPO算法改进原GRPO目标函数。

Result: 实验表明，使用λ-GRPO训练的LLM在验证准确率和下游推理任务上表现更好，且更快达到峰值性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明可以利用GRPO算法中内置的隐含过程奖励模型结构来提升性能，而无需依赖成本高昂的显式定义过程奖励模型。

Abstract: We prove theoretically that the GRPO RL algorithm induces a non-trivial
process reward model (PRM), under certain assumptions regarding within-group
overlap of token sequences across completions. We then show empirically that
these assumptions are met under real-world conditions: GRPO does in fact induce
a non-trivial PRM. Leveraging the framework of GRPO-as-a-PRM, we identify a
flaw in the GRPO objective: non-uniformly distributed process steps hinder both
exploration and exploitation (under different conditions). We propose a simple
modification to the algorithm to mitigate this defect ($\lambda$-GRPO), and
show that LLMs trained with $\lambda$-GRPO achieve higher validation accuracy
and performance on downstream reasoning tasks$-$and reach peak performance more
rapidly$-$than LLMs trained with standard GRPO. Our results call into question
the advantage of costly, explicitly-defined PRMs for GRPO: we show that it is
possible to instead leverage the hidden, built-in PRM structure within the
vanilla GRPO algorithm to boost model performance with a negligible impact on
training time and cost.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于f-散度的统一框架用于扩散模型的机器遗忘，替代传统的MSE方法，分析不同散度的收敛性和遗忘质量权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型的遗忘方法主要依赖MSE损失，但这种方法只是f-散度框架的一个特例，需要更灵活的遗忘框架来平衡遗忘强度与概念保留。

Method: 构建基于f-散度的统一遗忘框架，分析不同f-散度（如KL散度、JS散度等）在扩散模型遗忘中的收敛特性和效果差异。

Result: 证明了MSE方法是f-散度框架的特殊情况，不同f-散度在遗忘收敛性和概念保留质量上存在显著差异，为特定应用选择最优散度提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架为扩散模型遗忘提供了灵活范式，可根据具体应用需求选择最合适的f-散度来平衡遗忘强度与概念保留的权衡。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific knowledge from a trained model.
While diffusion models (DMs) have shown remarkable generative capabilities,
existing unlearning methods for text-to-image (T2I) models often rely on
minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the output distribution of a
target and an anchor concept. We show that this MSE-based approach is a special
case of a unified $f$-divergence-based framework, in which any $f$-divergence
can be utilized. We analyze the benefits of using different $f$-divergences,
that mainly impact the convergence properties of the algorithm and the quality
of unlearning. The proposed unified framework offers a flexible paradigm that
allows to select the optimal divergence for a specific application, balancing
different trade-offs between aggressive unlearning and concept preservation.

*Giuseppe Serra,Florian Buettner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DATS（Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling）的新方法，用于解决持续学习中的校准问题，通过距离感知的温度缩放来适应不同任务间的差异，提高模型的不确定性校准能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在持续学习场景中，现有方法主要从数据角度进行校准，使用单一温度参数，忽略了任务间的差异，导致不同任务间的校准误差波动较大。特别是在安全关键应用中，模型不仅需要良好的预测性能，还需要可靠的不确定性校准。

Method: 提出DATS方法，结合原型距离估计和距离感知校准，在没有先验任务信息的情况下推断任务接近度并分配自适应温度参数。

Result: 在标准基准测试和真实世界不平衡生物医学数据集上的广泛实验表明，DATS方法在减少跨任务校准误差方面比现有最先进方法更稳定、可靠和一致。

Conclusion: DATS方法通过距离感知的温度缩放有效解决了持续学习中的校准问题，为安全关键应用提供了更可靠的不确定性估计。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is recently gaining increasing attention for its
ability to enable a single model to learn incrementally from a sequence of new
classes. In this scenario, it is important to keep consistent predictive
performance across all the classes and prevent the so-called Catastrophic
Forgetting (CF). However, in safety-critical applications, predictive
performance alone is insufficient. Predictive models should also be able to
reliably communicate their uncertainty in a calibrated manner - that is, with
confidence scores aligned to the true frequencies of target events. Existing
approaches in CL address calibration primarily from a data-centric perspective,
relying on a single temperature shared across all tasks. Such solutions
overlook task-specific differences, leading to large fluctuations in
calibration error across tasks. For this reason, we argue that a more
principled approach should adapt the temperature according to the distance to
the current task. However, the unavailability of the task information at test
time/during deployment poses a major challenge to achieve the intended
objective. For this, we propose Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling (DATS),
which combines prototype-based distance estimation with distance-aware
calibration to infer task proximity and assign adaptive temperatures without
prior task information. Through extensive empirical evaluation on both standard
benchmarks and real-world, imbalanced datasets taken from the biomedical
domain, our approach demonstrates to be stable, reliable and consistent in
reducing calibration error across tasks compared to state-of-the-art
approaches.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在湍流长期自回归预测中失败，无法同时捕捉湍流动力学的局部耗散效应和全局非局部相互作用这两个不同的数学结构

Method: DINO框架通过并行分支显式建模湍流演化：局部微分算子（约束卷积网络）和全局积分算子（Transformer架构），实现物理驱动的算子分解

Conclusion: DINO为物理一致的长期湍流预测建立了新基准，展示了基于物理分解方法的卓越稳定性和鲁棒性

Abstract: Accurately forecasting the long-term evolution of turbulence represents a
grand challenge in scientific computing and is crucial for applications ranging
from climate modeling to aerospace engineering. Existing deep learning methods,
particularly neural operators, often fail in long-term autoregressive
predictions, suffering from catastrophic error accumulation and a loss of
physical fidelity. This failure stems from their inability to simultaneously
capture the distinct mathematical structures that govern turbulent dynamics:
local, dissipative effects and global, non-local interactions. In this paper,
we propose the
{\textbf{\underline{D}}}ifferential-{\textbf{\underline{I}}}ntegral
{\textbf{\underline{N}}}eural {\textbf{\underline{O}}}perator (\method{}), a
novel framework designed from a first-principles approach of operator
decomposition. \method{} explicitly models the turbulent evolution through
parallel branches that learn distinct physical operators: a local differential
operator, realized by a constrained convolutional network that provably
converges to a derivative, and a global integral operator, captured by a
Transformer architecture that learns a data-driven global kernel. This
physics-based decomposition endows \method{} with exceptional stability and
robustness. Through extensive experiments on the challenging 2D Kolmogorov flow
benchmark, we demonstrate that \method{} significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art models in long-term forecasting. It successfully suppresses
error accumulation over hundreds of timesteps, maintains high fidelity in both
the vorticity fields and energy spectra, and establishes a new benchmark for
physically consistent, long-range turbulence forecast.

TL;DR: MoT是一种在异构专家模型之间进行潜在层协作的方法，通过轻量级路由器选择专家并在共享潜在空间中进行交叉注意力，实现多LLM协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源LLM越来越专业化，需要利用不同模型的互补优势。现有方法要么路由到少数专家独立生成，要么通过多轮交互聚合输出，要么融合权重但需要架构同质性。

Method: 为每个查询选择top-K专家并指定主专家，在共享潜在空间中主专家对活跃专家进行交叉注意力。预训练专家保持冻结，只训练路由器和交互层。

Result: 在5个ID和3个OOD基准测试中，MoT比当前最先进的Avengers方法分别提升0.38%和2.92%，显著优于单个最佳模型，且推理时间与路由基线相当。

Conclusion: MoT提供了一种简单的潜在空间机制来组合异构LLM，是实现更广泛多LLM协作的实用步骤。

Abstract: Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly specialize by domain
(e.g., math, code, general reasoning), motivating systems that leverage
complementary strengths across models. Prior multi-LLM approaches either (i)
route a query to one or a few experts and generate independently, (ii)
aggregate outputs from each model via costly multi-turn exchanges, or (iii)
fuse weights into a single model-typically requiring architectural homogeneity.
We introduce Mixture of Thoughts (MoT), a simple method for latent-level
collaboration among heterogeneous experts under a global routing scheme. For
each query, a lightweight router selects top-$K$ experts and designates a
primary expert; uniformly placed interaction layers project hidden states into
a shared latent space where the primary expert performs cross-attention over
its active (selected) peers. Pre-trained experts remain frozen; only the router
and the lightweight interaction layers are trained with a novel joint training
objective that improves both the expert selection and inter-expert
collaboration. Across five in-distribution (ID) and three out-of-distribution
(OOD) benchmarks, MoT surpasses the current routing and aggregation-based
state-of-the-art, Avengers, by $+0.38\%$ and $+2.92\%$, respectively. Further,
MoT significantly outperforms the best-performing single model. It achieves
this with single-pass inference, runtime comparable to routing baselines, and
none of the overheads of iterative aggregation. MoT offers a simple
latent-space mechanism for combining heterogeneous LLMs, a practical step
toward broader multi-LLM collaboration. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的逆强化学习方法，将IRL简化为两个现成的监督学习问题：概率分类来估计行为策略，以及迭代回归来求解固定点方程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的最大熵IRL方法涉及复杂的内部优化、重复动态规划或对抗训练，限制了现代高表达能力函数逼近器（如神经网络）的使用。

Method: 通过分析发现种群最大似然解可由涉及行为策略的线性固定点方程表征，将IRL分解为概率分类和迭代回归两个监督学习任务。

Result: 该方法简单模块化，适用于各种函数逼近类别和算法，实验结果显示其性能与MaxEnt IRL相当或更优。

Conclusion: 新方法简化了IRL的实现，使其更容易与现代函数逼近器结合使用，为机器人模仿学习和经济学动态选择建模提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to explain observed behavior by
uncovering an underlying reward. In the maximum-entropy or
Gumbel-shocks-to-reward frameworks, this amounts to fitting a reward function
and a soft value function that together satisfy the soft Bellman consistency
condition and maximize the likelihood of observed actions. While this
perspective has had enormous impact in imitation learning for robotics and
understanding dynamic choices in economics, practical learning algorithms often
involve delicate inner-loop optimization, repeated dynamic programming, or
adversarial training, all of which complicate the use of modern, highly
expressive function approximators like neural nets and boosting. We revisit
softmax IRL and show that the population maximum-likelihood solution is
characterized by a linear fixed-point equation involving the behavior policy.
This observation reduces IRL to two off-the-shelf supervised learning problems:
probabilistic classification to estimate the behavior policy, and iterative
regression to solve the fixed point. The resulting method is simple and modular
across function approximation classes and algorithms. We provide a precise
characterization of the optimal solution, a generic oracle-based algorithm,
finite-sample error bounds, and empirical results showing competitive or
superior performance to MaxEnt IRL.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了过参数化线性回归中最小ℓp插值器(p∈(1,2])的参数范数族随样本量的缩放规律，并通过对偶射线分析揭示了信号尖峰与零坐标之间的竞争机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解过参数化线性回归中ℓp偏置插值下所有ℓr范数(r∈[1,p])的缩放行为，这是一个基本但尚未解决的问题。

Method: 采用简单的对偶射线分析，识别X⊤Y中信号尖峰与零坐标之间的竞争，得到数据依赖的转换点n⋆和通用阈值r⋆=2(p-1)。

Result: 建立了统一的解决方案，预测了ℓr范数何时饱和、何时继续增长，并将结果扩展到对角线性网络，通过初始化尺度α校准到有效peff(α)。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了不同ℓr范数在泛化代理中的预测能力存在敏感差异，为显式和隐式偏置之间建立了预测桥梁。

Abstract: For overparameterized linear regression with isotropic Gaussian design and
minimum-$\ell_p$ interpolator $p\in(1,2]$, we give a unified, high-probability
characterization for the scaling of the family of parameter norms $ \\{ \lVert
\widehat{w_p} \rVert_r \\}_{r \in [1,p]} $ with sample size.
  We solve this basic, but unresolved question through a simple dual-ray
analysis, which reveals a competition between a signal *spike* and a *bulk* of
null coordinates in $X^\top Y$, yielding closed-form predictions for (i) a
data-dependent transition $n_\star$ (the "elbow"), and (ii) a universal
threshold $r_\star=2(p-1)$ that separates $\lVert \widehat{w_p} \rVert_r$'s
which plateau from those that continue to grow with an explicit exponent.
  This unified solution resolves the scaling of *all* $\ell_r$ norms within the
family $r\in [1,p]$ under $\ell_p$-biased interpolation, and explains in one
picture which norms saturate and which increase as $n$ grows.
  We then study diagonal linear networks (DLNs) trained by gradient descent. By
calibrating the initialization scale $\alpha$ to an effective
$p_{\mathrm{eff}}(\alpha)$ via the DLN separable potential, we show empirically
that DLNs inherit the same elbow/threshold laws, providing a predictive bridge
between explicit and implicit bias.
  Given that many generalization proxies depend on $\lVert \widehat {w_p}
\rVert_r$, our results suggest that their predictive power will depend
sensitively on which $l_r$ norm is used.

Motivation: 现有基于重构的时间序列异常检测基础模型存在目标不匹配问题：难以识别细微异常，且容易将复杂正常模式误判为异常，导致高假阴性和假阳性率。

Method: 提出相对上下文差异（RCD）预训练范式，训练模型检测相邻时间窗口间的显著差异来识别异常；使用标准Transformer架构；构建大规模合成语料库进行预训练。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical task, but developing
models that generalize to unseen data in a zero-shot manner remains a major
challenge. Prevailing foundation models for TSAD predominantly rely on
reconstruction-based objectives, which suffer from a fundamental objective
mismatch: they struggle to identify subtle anomalies while often
misinterpreting complex normal patterns, leading to high rates of false
negatives and positives. To overcome these limitations, we introduce
\texttt{TimeRCD}, a novel foundation model for TSAD built upon a new
pre-training paradigm: Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD). Instead of learning
to reconstruct inputs, \texttt{TimeRCD} is explicitly trained to identify
anomalies by detecting significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows.
This relational approach, implemented with a standard Transformer architecture,
enables the model to capture contextual shifts indicative of anomalies that
reconstruction-based methods often miss. To facilitate this paradigm, we
develop a large-scale, diverse synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly
labels, providing the rich supervisory signal necessary for effective
pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{TimeRCD}
significantly outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific
foundation models in zero-shot TSAD across diverse datasets. Our results
validate the superiority of the RCD paradigm and establish a new, effective
path toward building robust and generalizable foundation models for time series
anomaly detection.

TL;DR: 这篇综述论文探讨了物理信息机器学习在预测与健康管理中的应用，通过将物理知识嵌入数据驱动模型来解决现实PHM中的挑战，包括噪声数据、标签有限和复杂非线性退化行为等问题。

Abstract: Prognostics and Health Management ensures the reliability, safety, and
efficiency of complex engineered systems by enabling fault detection,
anticipating equipment failures, and optimizing maintenance activities
throughout an asset lifecycle. However, real-world PHM presents persistent
challenges: sensor data is often noisy or incomplete, available labels are
limited, and degradation behaviors and system interdependencies can be highly
complex and nonlinear. Physics-informed machine learning has emerged as a
promising approach to address these limitations by embedding physical knowledge
into data-driven models. This review examines how incorporating learning and
observational biases through physics-informed modeling and data strategies can
guide models toward physically consistent and reliable predictions. Learning
biases embed physical constraints into model training through physics-informed
loss functions and governing equations, or by incorporating properties like
monotonicity. Observational biases influence data selection and synthesis to
ensure models capture realistic system behavior through virtual sensing for
estimating unmeasured states, physics-based simulation for data augmentation,
and multi-sensor fusion strategies. The review then examines how these
approaches enable the transition from passive prediction to active
decision-making through reinforcement learning, which allows agents to learn
maintenance policies that respect physical constraints while optimizing
operational objectives. This closes the loop between model-based predictions,
simulation, and actual system operation, empowering adaptive decision-making.
Finally, the review addresses the critical challenge of scaling PHM solutions
from individual assets to fleet-wide deployment. Fast adaptation methods
including meta-learning and few-shot learning are reviewed alongside domain
generalization techniques ...

Conclusion: GWTF为大规模语言模型的去中心化训练提供了一种实用且高效的解决方案，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Motivated by the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and the importance
of democratizing their training, we propose GWTF, the first crash tolerant
practical decentralized training framework for LLMs. Differently from existing
distributed and federated training frameworks, GWTF enables the efficient
collaborative training of a LLM on heterogeneous clients that volunteer their
resources. In addition, GWTF addresses node churn, i.e., clients joining or
leaving the system at any time, and network instabilities, i.e., network links
becoming unstable or unreliable. The core of GWTF is a novel decentralized flow
algorithm that finds the most effective routing that maximizes the number of
microbatches trained with the lowest possible delay. We extensively evaluate
GWTF on GPT-like and LLaMa-like models and compare it against the prior art.
Our results indicate that GWTF reduces the training time by up to 45% in
realistic and challenging scenarios that involve heterogeneous client nodes
distributed over 10 different geographic locations with a high node churn rate.

Conclusion: Tree-GRPO通过树结构有效解决了强化学习中的稀疏监督问题，在多种任务上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced
the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In long-term and
multi-turn agent tasks, existing approaches driven solely by outcome rewards
often suffer from the problem of sparse supervision. To address the challenge,
we propose Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (Tree-GRPO), a grouped
agent RL method based on tree search, where each tree node represents the
complete agent interaction step. By sharing common prefixes, the tree search
sampling increases the number of rollouts achievable within a fixed budget of
tokens or tool calls. Moreover, we find that the tree-structured trajectory
naturally allows the construction of step-wise process supervised signals even
using only the outcome reward. Based on this, Tree-GRPO estimates the grouped
relative advantages both on intra-tree and inter-tree levels. Through
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the objective of intra-tree level
group relative policy optimization is equivalent to that of step-level direct
preference learning. Experiments across 11 datasets and 3 types of QA tasks
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed tree-based RL over the chain-based
RL method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LoRA微调机制如何改变大语言模型的结构推理和语义行为是一个开放挑战，需要开发新的解释方法。

Method: 构建BioToolKG生物信息学工具知识图谱，设计CFFTLLMExplainer反事实解释器，通过软掩码学习最小结构扰动来诱导最大语义差异。

Result: 应用该框架到微调的LLaMA模型，发现反事实掩码能揭示模型的结构依赖性并与LoRA参数变化对齐。

Conclusion: 该工作为理解微调大语言模型的内部机制提供了新见解，反事实图谱有望成为可解释AI的潜在工具。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has enabled large
language models (LLMs) to acquire domain-specific knowledge with remarkable
efficiency. However, understanding how such a fine-tuning mechanism alters a
model's structural reasoning and semantic behavior remains an open challenge.
This work introduces a novel framework that explains fine-tuned LLMs via
counterfactuals grounded in knowledge graphs. Specifically, we construct
BioToolKG, a domain-specific heterogeneous knowledge graph in bioinformatics
tools and design a counterfactual-based fine-tuned LLMs explainer
(CFFTLLMExplainer) that learns soft masks over graph nodes and edges to
generate minimal structural perturbations that induce maximum semantic
divergence. Our method jointly optimizes structural sparsity and semantic
divergence while enforcing interpretability preserving constraints such as
entropy regularization and edge smoothness. We apply this framework to a
fine-tuned LLaMA-based LLM and reveal that counterfactual masking exposes the
model's structural dependencies and aligns with LoRA-induced parameter shifts.
This work provides new insights into the internal mechanisms of fine-tuned LLMs
and highlights counterfactual graphs as a potential tool for interpretable AI.

TL;DR: 本文提出了联邦流匹配（FFM）框架，用于在隐私约束下训练流匹配模型，解决了分布式数据无法集中训练的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数据分散在设备和机构中，隐私、所有权和法规限制阻止了数据集中化，因此需要在本地分布式数据上直接训练生成模型而不进行中心化聚合。

Method: 提出了三种方法：FFM-vanilla（客户端独立训练）、FFM-LOT（使用局部最优传输耦合）和FFM-GOT（基于最优传输半对偶公式的联邦策略，通过共享全局势函数协调客户端耦合）。

Result: 在合成和图像数据集上的实验表明，FFM能够在保护隐私的同时提高联邦设置下的流直线性和样本质量，性能与集中式基线相当。

Conclusion: FFM框架成功实现了隐私保护的分布式训练，同时保持了生成模型的质量和效率。

Abstract: Data today is decentralized, generated and stored across devices and
institutions where privacy, ownership, and regulation prevent centralization.
This motivates the need to train generative models directly from distributed
data locally without central aggregation. In this paper, we introduce Federated
Flow Matching (FFM), a framework for training flow matching models under
privacy constraints. Specifically, we first examine FFM-vanilla, where each
client trains locally with independent source and target couplings, preserving
privacy but yielding curved flows that slow inference. We then develop FFM-LOT,
which employs local optimal transport couplings to improve straightness within
each client but lacks global consistency under heterogeneous data. Finally, we
propose FFM-GOT, a federated strategy based on the semi-dual formulation of
optimal transport, where a shared global potential function coordinates
couplings across clients. Experiments on synthetic and image datasets show that
FFM enables privacy-preserving training while enhancing both the flow
straightness and sample quality in federated settings, with performance
comparable to the centralized baseline.

Motivation: 空气污染是全球性紧迫问题，现有方法局限于单一污染物或局部区域，难以处理复杂的多污染物相互作用、变化的气象条件和区域空间异质性

Method: 采用统一架构联合捕捉跨站点空间相关性、时间自相关性和气象-污染物动态因果关系，支持细粒度可解释的多污染物预测

Conclusion: AirPCM的长期预测能力为未来空气质量趋势和潜在高风险窗口提供可操作见解，为基于证据的环境治理和碳减排规划提供及时支持

Abstract: Air pollution, a pressing global problem, threatens public health,
environmental sustainability, and climate stability. Achieving accurate and
scalable forecasting across spatially distributed monitoring stations is
challenging due to intricate multi-pollutant interactions, evolving
meteorological conditions, and region specific spatial heterogeneity. To
address this challenge, we propose AirPCM, a novel deep spatiotemporal
forecasting model that integrates multi-region, multi-pollutant dynamics with
explicit meteorology-pollutant causality modeling. Unlike existing methods
limited to single pollutants or localized regions, AirPCM employs a unified
architecture to jointly capture cross-station spatial correlations, temporal
auto-correlations, and meteorology-pollutant dynamic causality. This empowers
fine-grained, interpretable multi-pollutant forecasting across varying
geographic and temporal scales, including sudden pollution episodes. Extensive
evaluations on multi-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that AirPCM
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both predictive accuracy
and generalization capability. Moreover, the long-term forecasting capability
of AirPCM provides actionable insights into future air quality trends and
potential high-risk windows, offering timely support for evidence-based
environmental governance and carbon mitigation planning.

Conclusion: SuperOffload系统成功解决了Superchips架构下LLM训练的挑战，为下一代AI硬件上的大规模模型训练提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of Superchips represents a significant advancement in
next-generation AI hardware. These Superchips employ a tightly coupled
heterogeneous architecture that integrates GPU and CPU on the same package,
which offers unprecedented computational power. However, there has been scant
research investigating how LLM training benefits from this new architecture. In
this work, for the first time, we study LLM training solutions based on
offloading for Superchips. We observe important differences between Superchips
and traditional loosely-coupled GPU-CPU architecture, which necessitate
revisiting prevailing assumptions about offloading. Based on that, we present
SuperOffload, a Superchip-centric offloading system that simultaneously uses
Hopper GPU, Grace CPU, and NVLink-C2C interconnect more efficiently.
SuperOffload accomplishes this via a combination of techniques, such as
adaptive weight offloading, bucketization repartitioning, Superchip-aware
casting, speculative execution, and a highly optimized Adam optimizer for Grace
CPUs. Our evaluation of SuperOffload on NVIDIA GH200 demonstrates up to 2.5x
throughput improvement compared to state-of-the-art offloading-based systems,
enabling training of up to 25B model on a single Superchip while achieving high
training throughput. We also extend SuperOffload with ZeRO-style data
parallelism and DeepSpeed-Ulysses sequence parallelism, enabling training of
13B model with sequence lengths up to 1 million tokens on 8 GH200 while
achieving 55% MFU.

*Madeleine Dwyer,Adam Sobey,Adriane Chapman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了概率平滑策略优化（PSPO）方法，通过平滑当前策略概率来替代传统的比率裁剪，在保持梯度信号的同时创建软信任区域，显著提升语言模型在数学推理任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的强化学习方法如PPO和GRPO依赖比率裁剪来稳定更新，但裁剪会丢弃信息并引入梯度不连续性。需要一种既能防止不稳定更新又能保留更多信息的方法。

Method: PSPO方法在计算重要性比率之前，将当前策略的概率向旧策略平滑，类似于标签平滑。该方法在GRPO框架中实例化为GR-PSPO，并在Qwen2.5模型上进行微调。

Result: 在GSM8K、SVAMP、ASDiv和MATH-500等数学推理任务上，GR-PSPO相比裁剪GRPO显著提升性能：0.5B模型从17.6%提升到39.7%，1.5B模型从37.8%提升到59.4%。同时产生更清晰、简洁和逻辑性更强的推理过程。

Conclusion: PSPO提供了一种有效的替代比率裁剪的方法，既能防止不稳定更新，又能保留梯度信息，在数学推理任务上表现出显著优势，为语言模型的强化学习训练提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL)
methods such as PPO and GRPO commonly relies on ratio clipping to stabilise
updates. While effective at preventing instability, clipping discards
information and introduces gradient discontinuities. We propose Probability
Smoothing Policy Optimisation (PSPO), which smooths the current policy's
probabilities toward the old (behaviour) policy before computing the importance
ratio, analogous to label smoothing. Unlike clipping, PSPO preserves gradient
signal, while interpolation toward the old policy creates a soft trust region
that discourages large, destabilising updates, with formal guarantees.
  We instantiate PSPO within GRPO (GR-PSPO) and fine-tune Qwen2.5-0.5B and
Qwen2.5-1.5B on GSM8K, evaluating on GSM8K test and the cross-dataset
generalisation on SVAMP, ASDiv, and MATH-500. Relative to unclipped GRPO
(single iteration; no data reuse, ratio always = 1), GR-PSPO achieves similar
performance but improves the reasoning leading to clearer and more concise
responses which are more logical. Compared to clipped GRPO, GR-PSPO
substantially improves performance both the 0.5B and 1.5B models, with a boost
of over 20% on GSM8K (39.7% vs. 17.6% for 0.5B, 59.4% vs. 37.8% for 1.5B).

Motivation: 现有鲁棒追索方法使用L^∞范数衡量模型变化，可能导致追索解决方案成本过高。本文旨在通过使用更约束的L^p范数来解决这一缺陷。

Method: 开发了一种新算法，能够可证明地计算广义线性模型的最优鲁棒追索，针对L^p范数约束的模型变化进行优化。

Result: 实验表明，该算法在线性和非线性模型上都显著降低了追索成本（高达几个数量级），并在追索实施成本与有效性之间实现了更好的权衡，同时提供更稀疏的追索方案。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法相比现有工作具有更低的追索成本、更好的权衡性能和更强的鲁棒性，能够抵抗保证可行性的后处理方法的干扰。

Abstract: Recourse provides individuals who received undesirable labels (e.g., denied a
loan) from algorithmic decision-making systems with a minimum-cost improvement
suggestion to achieve the desired outcome. However, in practice, models often
get updated to reflect changes in the data distribution or environment,
invalidating the recourse recommendations (i.e., following the recourse will
not lead to the desirable outcome). The robust recourse literature addresses
this issue by providing a framework for computing recourses whose validity is
resilient to slight changes in the model. However, since the optimization
problem of computing robust recourse is non-convex (even for linear models),
most of the current approaches do not have any theoretical guarantee on the
optimality of the recourse. Recent work by Kayastha et. al. provides the first
provably optimal algorithm for robust recourse with respect to generalized
linear models when the model changes are measured using the $L^{\infty}$ norm.
However, using the $L^{\infty}$ norm can lead to recourse solutions with a high
price. To address this shortcoming, we consider more constrained model changes
defined by the $L^p$ norm, where $p\geq 1$ but $p\neq \infty$, and provide a
new algorithm that provably computes the optimal robust recourse for
generalized linear models. Empirically, for both linear and non-linear models,
we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a significantly lower price of
recourse (up to several orders of magnitude) compared to prior work and also
exhibits a better trade-off between the implementation cost of recourse and its
validity. Our empirical analysis also illustrates that our approach provides
more sparse recourses compared to prior work and remains resilient to
post-processing approaches that guarantee feasibility.

Motivation: 神经网络记忆训练数据引发隐私安全问题，现有重构攻击方法缺乏坚实的理论基础，需要分析其固有弱点和局限性。

Method: 从理论角度严格证明重构攻击的不可靠性，并通过实证研究验证理论结果。

Result: 证明无先验知识时存在无限多替代解，精确复制训练数据仅是偶然现象；发现训练更充分的网络更抗重构攻击。

Conclusion: 重构攻击本质上不可靠，训练更充分的网络能同时保证泛化能力和隐私安全，为缓解重构攻击提供新思路。

Abstract: The memorization of training data by neural networks raises pressing concerns
for privacy and security. Recent work has shown that, under certain conditions,
portions of the training set can be reconstructed directly from model
parameters. Some of these methods exploit implicit bias toward margin
maximization, suggesting that properties often regarded as beneficial for
generalization may actually compromise privacy. Yet despite striking empirical
demonstrations, the reliability of these attacks remains poorly understood and
lacks a solid theoretical foundation. In this work, we take a complementary
perspective: rather than designing stronger attacks, we analyze the inherent
weaknesses and limitations of existing reconstruction methods and identify
conditions under which they fail. We rigorously prove that, without
incorporating prior knowledge about the data, there exist infinitely many
alternative solutions that may lie arbitrarily far from the true training set,
rendering reconstruction fundamentally unreliable. Empirically, we further
demonstrate that exact duplication of training examples occurs only by chance.
Our results refine the theoretical understanding of when training set leakage
is possible and offer new insights into mitigating reconstruction attacks.
Remarkably, we demonstrate that networks trained more extensively, and
therefore satisfying implicit bias conditions more strongly -- are, in fact,
less susceptible to reconstruction attacks, reconciling privacy with the need
for strong generalization in this setting.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于时序逻辑的AI智能体行为监控语言，用于检测LLM智能体系统中的行为异常，通过监控工具调用序列和状态转换来验证系统行为模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于文本匹配的错误检测方法对LLM输出的自然语言变异性很脆弱，需要一种独立于具体文本输出的系统行为验证方法。

Method: 使用时序逻辑技术监控智能体执行轨迹，包括工具调用和智能体间通信序列，定义正确行为模式的时序断言。

Conclusion: 该方法为AI智能体可靠性监控提供了系统化基础，特别适用于关键应用中的生产系统行为回归检测。

Abstract: This paper presents a temporal expression language for monitoring AI agent
behavior, enabling systematic error-detection of LLM-based agentic systems that
exhibit variable outputs due to stochastic generation processes. Drawing from
temporal logic techniques used in hardware verification, this approach monitors
execution traces of agent tool calls and state transitions to detect deviations
from expected behavioral patterns. Current error-detection approaches rely
primarily on text matching of inputs and outputs, which proves fragile due to
the natural language variability inherent in LLM responses. The proposed method
instead focuses on the sequence of agent actions -- such as tool invocations
and inter-agent communications -- allowing verification of system behavior
independent of specific textual outputs. The temporal expression language
provides assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across multiple
execution scenarios. These assertions serve dual purposes: validating prompt
engineering and guardrail effectiveness during development, and providing
regression testing when agents are updated with new LLMs or modified logic. The
approach is demonstrated using a three-agent system, where agents coordinate to
solve multi-step reasoning tasks. When powered by large, capable models, all
temporal assertions were satisfied across many test runs. However, when smaller
models were substituted in two of the three agents, executions violated
behavioral assertions, primarily due to improper tool sequencing and failed
coordination handoffs. The temporal expressions successfully flagged these
anomalies, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for detecting behavioral
regressions in production agentic systems. This approach provides a foundation
for systematic monitoring of AI agent reliability as these systems become
increasingly deployed in critical applications.

Result: 实验结果表明，LATTS相比标准验证器方法实现了显著更优的准确性-计算权衡。

Conclusion: LATTS通过局部自适应计算分配有效解决了测试时扩展中的资源效率问题，为LLM下游任务性能优化提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: One common strategy for improving the performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs) on downstream tasks involves using a \emph{verifier model} to either
select the best answer from a pool of candidates or to steer the
auto-regressive generation process towards better outputs. This class of
methods typically results in improved accuracy at the cost of increased
computation at test-time, a paradigm known as \emph{test-time scaling}.
However, most existing approaches increase computation uniformly across all
samples and generation steps, without considering the complexity of individual
instances, leading to inefficient resource use. We address this limitation by
proposing an approach, called \emph{Locally Adaptive Test-Time Scaling
(LATTS)}, that allocates variable compute across generation steps.
Specifically, at each generation step, LATTS employs a verifier-based
acceptance criterion to decide whether to resample, backtrack, restart, or stop
the generation process. This criterion effectively adjusts the per-step
computational effort based on a precise notion of \emph{local difficulty}
derived from the verifier model. Empirical results show that LATTS achieves
significantly superior accuracy--compute tradeoffs compared to standard
verifier-based methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的重构框架，用于动态验证和组装时间触发系统的调度方案，解决消息碰撞、锁定循环等挑战，确保系统安全性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间触发系统在动态操作环境中面临消息碰撞、错误优先级处理导致的锁定循环等问题，这些会危及系统安全和性能，需要一种能够动态验证和组装调度的解决方案。

Method: 提出重构框架，通过系统地将AI生成或启发式获得的调度优先级转换为完全可执行的调度，包含安全检查、高效分配算法和恢复机制来处理意外事件。

Result: 实验表明该框架显著提高了系统适应性、操作完整性和运行时性能，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: 这项工作为安全关键时间触发系统提供了实用且可扩展的安全调度生成解决方案，即使在高度动态和不确定的操作条件下也能实现可靠灵活的实时调度。

Abstract: Adaptive scheduling is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of
time-triggered systems (TTS) in dynamic operational environments. Scheduling
frameworks face significant challenges, including message collisions, locked
loops from incorrect precedence handling, and the generation of incomplete or
invalid schedules, which can compromise system safety and performance. To
address these challenges, this paper presents a novel reconstruction framework
designed to dynamically validate and assemble schedules. The proposed
reconstruction models operate by systematically transforming AI-generated or
heuristically derived scheduling priorities into fully executable schedules,
ensuring adherence to critical system constraints such as precedence rules and
collision-free communication. It incorporates robust safety checks, efficient
allocation algorithms, and recovery mechanisms to handle unexpected context
events, including hardware failures and mode transitions. Comprehensive
experiments were conducted across multiple performance profiles, including
makespan minimisation, workload balancing, and energy efficiency, to validate
the operational effectiveness of the reconstruction models. Results demonstrate
that the proposed framework significantly enhances system adaptability,
operational integrity, and runtime performance while maintaining computational
efficiency. Overall, this work contributes a practical and scalable solution to
the problem of safe schedule generation in safety-critical TTS, enabling
reliable and flexible real-time scheduling even under highly dynamic and
uncertain operational conditions.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在时间触发架构中集成自适应在线学习单元的元调度方法，以解决传统离线训练AI调度推理时构建全面多调度图（MSG）的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离线训练方法在构建考虑所有可能场景（如硬件故障、松弛变化、模式变化）的MSG时面临资源密集和不可行的挑战，因为离线生成的MSG只是完整概率空间的子集。

Method: 在元调度器中集成自适应在线学习单元，使用强化学习（RL）模型进行实时训练，持续探索新的调度解决方案，扩展MSG并优化系统性能。

Result: 在线学习单元能够有效处理意外事件和复杂调度场景，通过实时训练不断优化AI推理，使系统在严格截止时间或新性能标准下保持灵活性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法确保了大规模安全关键环境中系统的可靠性和效率，通过动态适应机制提升了元调度在动态不可预测环境中的性能。

Abstract: Metascheduling in time-triggered architectures has been crucial in adapting
to dynamic and unpredictable environments, ensuring the reliability and
efficiency of task execution. However, traditional approaches face significant
challenges when training Artificial Intelligence (AI) scheduling inferences
offline, particularly due to the complexities involved in constructing a
comprehensive Multi-Schedule Graph (MSG) that accounts for all possible
scenarios. The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability
space, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack
variations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To
address these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit
integrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time. The
primary motivation for developing this unit stems from the limitations of
offline training, where the MSG created is inherently a subset of the complete
space, focusing only on the most probable and critical context events. In the
online mode, Reinforcement Learning (RL) plays a pivotal role by continuously
exploring and discovering new scheduling solutions, thus expanding the MSG and
enhancing system performance over time. This dynamic adaptation allows the
system to handle unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more
effectively. Several RL models were implemented within the online learning
unit, each designed to address specific challenges in scheduling. These models
not only facilitate the discovery of new solutions but also optimize existing
schedulers, particularly when stricter deadlines or new performance criteria
are introduced. By continuously refining the AI inferences through real-time
training, the system remains flexible and capable of meeting evolving demands,
thus ensuring robustness and efficiency in large-scale, safety-critical
environments.

Result: 使用公共存储库中的真实生物信号进行实验评估，对开发方法的参数和程序进行了实验比较分析，并与文献中的类似系统进行了比较

Conclusion: 提出的模糊识别系统能够有效检测和减轻生物信号污染对假肢控制质量的影响

Abstract: Modern anthropomorphic upper limb bioprostheses are typically controlled by
electromyographic (EMG) biosignals using a pattern recognition scheme.
Unfortunately, there are many factors originating from the human source of
objects to be classified and from the human-prosthesis interface that make it
difficult to obtain an acceptable classification quality. One of these factors
is the high susceptibility of biosignals to contamination, which can
considerably reduce the quality of classification of a recognition system.
  In the paper, the authors propose a new recognition system intended for EMG
based control of the hand prosthesis with detection of contaminated biosignals
in order to mitigate the adverse effect of contaminations. The system consists
of two ensembles: the set of one-class classifiers (OCC) to assess the degree
of contamination of individual channels and the ensemble of K-nearest
neighbours (KNN) classifier to recognise the patient's intent. For all
recognition systems, an original, coherent fuzzy model was developed, which
allows the use of a uniform soft (fuzzy) decision scheme throughout the
recognition process. The experimental evaluation was conducted using real
biosignals from a public repository. The goal was to provide an experimental
comparative analysis of the parameters and procedures of the developed method
on which the quality of the recognition system depends. The proposed fuzzy
recognition system was also compared with similar systems described in the
literature.

Motivation: 现有LLM智能体在生成有意义的反思方面存在挑战，主要由于错误分析不足和对罕见成功轨迹的依赖，特别是在复杂任务中。

Method: 提出SAMULE框架，通过多级反思合成训练回顾性语言模型：单轨迹学习（微观）进行详细错误修正；任务内学习（中观）构建错误分类法；任务间学习（宏观）提取可转移见解。还扩展了基于前瞻的反思机制。

Conclusion: 精心设计的反思合成和以失败为中心的学习在构建自改进LLM智能体中起着关键作用。

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in LLM agents, they still face the challenge
of generating meaningful reflections due to inadequate error analysis and a
reliance on rare successful trajectories, especially in complex tasks. In this
work, we propose SAMULE, a new framework for self-learning agents powered by a
retrospective language model that is trained based on Multi-Level Reflection
Synthesis. It first synthesizes high-quality reflections across three
complementary levels: Single-Trajectory Learning (micro-level) for detailed
error correction; Intra-Task Learning (meso-level) to build error taxonomies
across multiple trials of the same task, and Inter-Task Learning (macro-level)
to extract transferable insights based on same typed errors from diverse task
failures. Then we fine-tune a language model serving as the retrospective model
to generate reflections during inference. We further extend our framework to
interactive settings through a foresight-based reflection mechanism, enabling
agents to proactively reflect and adapt during user interactions by comparing
predicted and actual responses. Extensive experiments on three challenging
benchmarks - TravelPlanner, NATURAL PLAN, and Tau-bench - demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms reflection-based baselines. Our results
highlight the critical role of well-designed reflection synthesis and
failure-centric learning in building self-improving LLM agents.

product ecosystems which include cloud services, application programming
interfaces (APIs), mobile platforms, and edge devices. This study introduces
autonomous goal driven agents capable of dynamic learning and context-aware

cloud simulations. The evaluation results show increased adaptability,
decreased response latency, and improved detection accuracy. The architecture
provides an intelligent and scalable blueprint for safeguarding complex digital
infrastructure and is compatible with zero-trust models, thereby supporting the
adherence to international cybersecurity regulations.

Abstract: The benefit claims of a product is a critical driver of consumers' purchase
behavior. Creating product claims is an intense task that requires substantial
time and funding. We have developed the $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ web
application to accelerate claim creations using in-context learning and
fine-tuning of large language models (LLM). $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ was
designed to disrupt the speed and economics of claim search, generation,
optimization, and simulation. It has three functions: (1) semantically
searching and identifying existing claims and/or visuals that resonate with the
voice of consumers; (2) generating and/or optimizing claims based on a product
description and a consumer profile; and (3) ranking generated and/or manually
created claims using simulations via synthetic consumers. Applications in a
consumer packaged goods (CPG) company have shown very promising results. We
believe that this capability is broadly useful and applicable across product
categories and industries. We share our learning to encourage the research and
application of generative AI in different industries.

Abstract: Purpose: To develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system powered by
LLaMA-4 109B for automated, protocol-aware, and interpretable evaluation of
radiotherapy treatment plans.
  Methods and Materials: We curated a multi-protocol dataset of 614
radiotherapy plans across four disease sites and constructed a knowledge base
containing normalized dose metrics and protocol-defined constraints. The RAG
system integrates three core modules: a retrieval engine optimized across five
SentenceTransformer backbones, a percentile prediction component based on
cohort similarity, and a clinical constraint checker. These tools are directed
by a large language model (LLM) using a multi-step prompt-driven reasoning
pipeline to produce concise, grounded evaluations.
  Results: Retrieval hyperparameters were optimized using Gaussian Process on a
scalarized loss function combining root mean squared error (RMSE), mean
absolute error (MAE), and clinically motivated accuracy thresholds. The best
configuration, based on all-MiniLM-L6-v2, achieved perfect nearest-neighbor
accuracy within a 5-percentile-point margin and a sub-2pt MAE. When tested
end-to-end, the RAG system achieved 100% agreement with the computed values by
standalone retrieval and constraint-checking modules on both percentile
estimates and constraint identification, confirming reliable execution of all
retrieval, prediction and checking steps.
  Conclusion: Our findings highlight the feasibility of combining structured
population-based scoring with modular tool-augmented reasoning for transparent,
scalable plan evaluation in radiation therapy. The system offers traceable
outputs, minimizes hallucination, and demonstrates robustness across protocols.
Future directions include clinician-led validation, and improved domain-adapted
retrieval models to enhance real-world integration.

TL;DR: Fairy是一个交互式多智能体移动助手，通过跨应用协作、交互式执行和持续学习来解决现有移动GUI智能体在多样化应用界面和动态用户需求下的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大规模多模态模型在移动GUI智能体应用中面临两个主要问题：端到端方法在长尾应用上表现不佳，缺乏用户交互的智能体行为会损害用户体验。需要一种能够持续积累应用知识并在使用过程中自我进化的解决方案。

Method: Fairy包含三个核心模块：(1)全局任务规划器，从跨应用视角分解用户任务；(2)应用级执行器，基于长短时记忆将子任务细化为步骤和动作，通过四个核心智能体在双循环中实现精确执行和用户交互；(3)自学习器，将执行经验整合到应用地图和技巧中。

Conclusion: Fairy通过其交互式执行和自我学习机制，在真实移动应用场景中表现出显著优势，证明了其交互和学习能力的有效性。

Abstract: Large multi-modal models (LMMs) have advanced mobile GUI agents. However,
existing methods struggle with real-world scenarios involving diverse app
interfaces and evolving user needs. End-to-end methods relying on model's
commonsense often fail on long-tail apps, and agents without user interaction
act unilaterally, harming user experience. To address these limitations, we
propose Fairy, an interactive multi-agent mobile assistant capable of
continuously accumulating app knowledge and self-evolving during usage. Fairy
enables cross-app collaboration, interactive execution, and continual learning
through three core modules:(i) a Global Task Planner that decomposes user tasks
into sub-tasks from a cross-app view; (ii) an App-Level Executor that refines
sub-tasks into steps and actions based on long- and short-term memory,
achieving precise execution and user interaction via four core agents operating
in dual loops; and (iii) a Self-Learner that consolidates execution experience
into App Map and Tricks. To evaluate Fairy, we introduce RealMobile-Eval, a
real-world benchmark with a comprehensive metric suite, and LMM-based agents
for automated scoring. Experiments show that Fairy with GPT-4o backbone
outperforms the previous SoTA by improving user requirement completion by 33.7%
and reducing redundant steps by 58.5%, showing the effectiveness of its

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合自回归（AR）和非自回归（NAR）语言模型的新框架，通过NAR模型高效生成中间推理轨迹，再由AR模型输出精确最终答案，在保持质量的同时显著提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型虽然能生成连贯输出但推理速度慢，特别是在数学和代码等需要长推理链的领域；非自回归模型虽然速度快但输出质量较低。需要结合两者优势来解决推理任务中的效率与质量平衡问题。

Method: 采用AR和NAR模型集成框架：NAR模型（如离散扩散模型）并行生成中间推理轨迹，AR模型基于这些轨迹生成精确最终答案。

Result: 实验表明该方法相比强基线有26%的性能提升，同时大幅降低了推理成本。

Conclusion: 该集成框架成功结合了AR和NAR模型的优势，在推理任务中实现了效率与质量的平衡，为复杂推理问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study reasoning tasks through a framework that integrates auto-regressive
(AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) language models. AR models, which generate
text sequentially, excel at producing coherent outputs but often suffer from
slow inference, particularly in reasoning-intensive domains such as mathematics
and code, where lengthy chains of thought are required. In contrast, NAR
models, such as discrete diffusion models, allow parallel generation and offer
substantial speedups, though typically at the cost of reduced output quality.
To address these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm in which an NAR model
efficiently produces intermediate reasoning traces, which subsequently guide an
AR model to deliver precise final answers. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach yields significant 26% improvements over strong baselines while
substantially reducing inference cost.

Conclusion: Meta-Memory为机器人提供了强大准确的空间推理能力，通过创新的记忆检索和整合机制解决了机器人空间问答的关键挑战。

Abstract: Navigating complex environments requires robots to effectively store
observations as memories and leverage them to answer human queries about
spatial locations, which is a critical yet underexplored research challenge.
While prior work has made progress in constructing robotic memory, few have
addressed the principled mechanisms needed for efficient memory retrieval and
integration. To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-Memory, a large language model
(LLM)-driven agent that constructs a high-density memory representation of the
environment. The key innovation of Meta-Memory lies in its capacity to retrieve
and integrate relevant memories through joint reasoning over semantic and
spatial modalities in response to natural language location queries, thereby
empowering robots with robust and accurate spatial reasoning capabilities. To
evaluate its performance, we introduce SpaceLocQA, a large-scale dataset
encompassing diverse real-world spatial question-answering scenarios.
Experimental results show that Meta-Memory significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on both the SpaceLocQA and the public NaVQA
benchmarks. Furthermore, we successfully deployed Meta-Memory on real-world
robotic platforms, demonstrating its practical utility in complex environments.

Result: 在四个不同日志分析任务上的实验表明，LogReasoner显著优于现有LLM，达到最先进性能

Conclusion: LogReasoner有效增强了LLM在日志分析中的推理能力，展示了其在自动化日志分析中的潜力

Abstract: Log analysis is crucial for monitoring system health and diagnosing failures
in complex systems. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for automated log analysis, leveraging their reasoning
capabilities to perform tasks such as anomaly detection and failure prediction.
However, general-purpose LLMs struggle to formulate structured reasoning
workflows that align with expert cognition and deliver precise details of
reasoning steps. To address these challenges, we propose LogReasoner, a
coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework designed to enable LLMs to
reason log analysis tasks like experts. LogReasoner consists of two stages: (1)
coarse-grained enhancement of expert thinking, where high-level expert thoughts
are constructed from collected troubleshooting flowcharts and existing tasks to
enable LLMs to formulate structured reasoning workflows and (2) fine-grained
enhancement of specific steps, where we first fine-tune the LLM with
task-specific stepwise solutions to enhance the LLM for instantiated reasoning,
then employ the preference learning to calibrate the LLM's reasoning details
from its mistakes, further strengthen the LLM's analytical granularity and
correctness. We evaluate LogReasoner on four distinct log analysis tasks using
open-source LLMs such as Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3. Experimental results show that
LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning

Result: 在多个基准测试中，DeFacto显著提高了答案准确性和推理忠实性，为可解释的多模态推理建立了更强基础。

Conclusion: DeFacto通过反事实推理框架有效解决了多模态推理中的忠实性问题，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal language models (MLLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress in vision-language reasoning, especially with the emergence
of "thinking with images," which integrates explicit visual steps into the
reasoning process. While this paradigm strengthens image-based reasoning, a
significant challenge remains: models may arrive at correct answers by relying
on irrelevant or spurious regions, driven by prior knowledge or dataset biases.
Even when the answer is correct, flawed reasoning indicates that the model has
not truly understood the image, highlighting the critical importance of
reasoning fidelity in multimodal tasks. To address this issue, we propose
DeFacto, a counterfactual reasoning framework that jointly enforces accurate
answering and faithful reasoning. A key component of our approach is the design
of three complementary training paradigms: (i) positive, (ii) counterfactual,
and (iii) random-masking. To enable these paradigms, we develop a pipeline that
automatically localizes question-relevant evidence and constructs positive,
counterfactual, and random variants, resulting in a dataset of about 100k
images. Building on this framework, we train multimodal language models with
GRPO-based reinforcement learning, where we design three complementary rewards
to guide the model toward accurate answering and evidence-grounded reasoning.
Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DeFacto substantially
improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, establishing a
stronger foundation for interpretable multimodal reasoning. The code is
available on GitHub and the dataset is released on HuggingFace.

TL;DR: GALAX是一个创新框架，通过图增强语言模型结合强化学习，将预训练图神经网络集成到大型语言模型中，用于精准医学中的可解释子图推理和靶点发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在精准医学中只能部分利用多组学特征、拓扑结构和文本知识，缺乏可靠的中间评估机制，限制了机制可解释性。需要整合数值证据、拓扑知识和语言上下文。

Method: 提出GALAX框架，通过图过程奖励模型引导强化学习，将预训练GNN集成到LLM中，以逐步方式生成疾病相关子图，实现过程级监督而无需显式中间推理标注。

Result: 开发了Target-QA基准，结合CRISPR识别靶点、多组学谱和生物医学图知识，支持GNN预训练和长上下文推理，为可解释靶点和通路发现提供可扩展框架。

Conclusion: GALAX通过整合多组学信号、拓扑结构和文本知识，为精准医学提供了可靠且可解释的靶点和通路发现方法，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: In precision medicine, quantitative multi-omic features, topological context,
and textual biological knowledge play vital roles in identifying
disease-critical signaling pathways and targets. Existing pipelines capture
only part of these-numerical omics ignore topological context, text-centric
LLMs lack quantitative grounded reasoning, and graph-only models underuse node
semantics and the generalization of LLMs-limiting mechanistic interpretability.
Although Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to guide reasoning in LLMs, they
remain limited by unreliable intermediate evaluation, and vulnerability to
reward hacking with computational cost. These gaps motivate integrating
quantitative multi-omic signals, topological structure with node annotations,
and literature-scale text via LLMs, using subgraph reasoning as the principle
bridge linking numeric evidence, topological knowledge and language context.
Therefore, we propose GALAX (Graph Augmented LAnguage model with
eXplainability), an innovative framework that integrates pretrained Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) via reinforcement
guided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM), which generates disease-relevant
subgraphs in a step-wise manner initiated by an LLM and iteratively evaluated
by a pretrained GNN, enabling process-level supervision without explicit
intermediate reasoning annotations. As an application, we also introduced
Target-QA, a benchmark combining CRISPR-identified targets, multi-omic
profiles, and biomedical graph knowledge across diverse cancer cell lines,
which enables GNN pretraining for supervising step-wise graph construction and
supports long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs (TNGs), providing a
scalable and biologically grounded framework for explainable,
reinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning toward reliable and interpretable
target and pathway discovery in precision medicine.

TL;DR: 提出基于大语言模型的移动应用评论分析框架，解决传统星级评分系统无法捕捉文本评论中细微反馈的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统星级评分系统虽然直观流行，但无法捕捉详细评论文本中的细微反馈，传统NLP技术也难以理解上下文细微差别、领域特定术语和讽刺等语言特征

Method: 采用模块化框架，利用大语言模型结合结构化提示技术，量化数值评分与文本情感之间的差异，提取特征级见解，并通过检索增强的对话问答支持交互式评论探索

Result: 在三个不同数据集上的综合实验表明，该LLM驱动方法显著优于基线方法，在具有挑战性和上下文丰富的评论场景中提高了准确性、鲁棒性和可操作性见解

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的方法能够有效解决传统评论分析的局限性，为移动应用评论分析提供了更准确和实用的解决方案

Abstract: We present an advanced approach to mobile app review analysis aimed at
addressing limitations inherent in traditional star-rating systems. Star
ratings, although intuitive and popular among users, often fail to capture the
nuanced feedback present in detailed review texts. Traditional NLP techniques
-- such as lexicon-based methods and classical machine learning classifiers --
struggle to interpret contextual nuances, domain-specific terminology, and
subtle linguistic features like sarcasm. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a modular framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) enhanced by
structured prompting techniques. Our method quantifies discrepancies between
numerical ratings and textual sentiment, extracts detailed, feature-level
insights, and supports interactive exploration of reviews through
retrieval-augmented conversational question answering (RAG-QA). Comprehensive
experiments conducted on three diverse datasets (AWARE, Google Play, and
Spotify) demonstrate that our LLM-driven approach significantly surpasses
baseline methods, yielding improved accuracy, robustness, and actionable
insights in challenging and context-rich review scenarios.

TL;DR: AOT*是一个将大型语言模型生成的化学合成路径与AND-OR树搜索相结合的反合成规划框架，显著提高了搜索效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多步反合成规划面临指数级搜索空间和高推理成本的挑战，现有LLM方法在效率和成本方面存在限制。

Method: AOT*通过将LLM生成的完整合成路径原子化映射到AND-OR树组件，设计数学上合理的奖励分配策略和基于检索的上下文工程，使LLM能够在化学空间中高效导航。

Result: 在多个合成基准测试中，AOT*实现了最先进的性能，使用比现有LLM方法少3-5倍的迭代次数就能达到竞争性的解决率，在复杂分子目标上效率优势更加明显。

Conclusion: AOT*通过集成LLM生成能力和系统化树搜索，有效解决了反合成规划中的效率和成本问题，为药物发现和材料设计等领域提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning enables the discovery of viable synthetic routes for
target molecules, playing a crucial role in domains like drug discovery and
materials design. Multi-step retrosynthetic planning remains computationally
challenging due to exponential search spaces and inference costs. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate chemical reasoning capabilities, their
application to synthesis planning faces constraints on efficiency and cost. To
address these challenges, we introduce AOT*, a framework that transforms
retrosynthetic planning by integrating LLM-generated chemical synthesis
pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search. To this end, AOT* atomically maps
the generated complete synthesis routes onto AND-OR tree components, with a
mathematically sound design of reward assignment strategy and retrieval-based
context engineering, thus enabling LLMs to efficiently navigate in the chemical
space. Experimental evaluation on multiple synthesis benchmarks demonstrates
that AOT* achieves SOTA performance with significantly improved search
efficiency. AOT* exhibits competitive solve rates using 3-5$\times$ fewer
iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with the efficiency advantage
becoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的代理评估基准往往将评估简化为对最终状态的二元判断，忽略了安全性、效率和中间正确性等关键方面，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 使用确定性有限自动机（DFA）将任务编码为有效工具使用路径的集合，在此基础上开发CORE评估套件，包含路径正确性、前缀关键性、有害调用率和效率等五个指标。

Result: 在不同世界模型中，该方法揭示了在传统最终状态评估方案下看似等效的代理之间重要的性能差异。

Conclusion: 提出的DFA框架和CORE评估套件能够对AI代理的行为进行原则性评估，比传统方法更全面地反映代理的实际表现。

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents that solve real-world tasks through function-call
sequences remains an open challenge. Existing agentic benchmarks often reduce
evaluation to a binary judgment of the final state, overlooking critical
aspects such as safety, efficiency, and intermediate correctness. We propose a
framework based on deterministic finite automata (DFAs) that encodes tasks as
sets of valid tool-use paths, enabling principled assessment of agent behavior
in diverse world models. Building on this foundation, we introduce CORE, a
suite of five metrics, namely Path Correctness, Path Correctness - Kendall's
tau Composite, Prefix Criticality, Harmful-Call Rate, and Efficiency, that
quantify alignment with expected execution patterns. Across diverse worlds, our
method reveals important performance differences between agents that would
otherwise appear equivalent under traditional final-state evaluation schemes.

TL;DR: SciTrek是一个新的问答基准，用于评估大语言模型在科学文章上的长上下文推理能力，通过自动生成复杂问题来测试信息聚合和综合能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的长上下文基准大多使用非科学文本、关注简单信息检索任务或使用人工构造的上下文，无法充分评估模型在真实科学文献上的推理能力。

Method: 通过将问题构建为对文章元数据数据库的SQL查询来自动生成问题和答案，提供可验证的推理步骤，支持长达100万token的上下文。

Result: 实验表明随着上下文长度增加，SciTrek对各类LLM构成显著挑战，监督微调和强化学习效果有限，模型在数值运算和信息定位方面存在系统性缺陷。

Conclusion: SciTrek揭示了当前LLM在长上下文科学推理方面的局限性，为评估和改进模型的长文本处理能力提供了有效工具。

Abstract: This paper introduces SciTrek, a novel question-answering benchmark designed
to evaluate the long-context reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) using scientific articles. Current long-context benchmarks often rely on
non-scientific texts, focus on simple information retrieval tasks, or employ
artificial contexts. SciTrek addresses these limitations by proposing complex
questions that require information aggregation and synthesis across multiple
full-text scientific articles. Questions and their ground-truth answers are
automatically generated by formulating them as SQL queries over a database
constructed from article metadata (titles, authors, and references). The SQL
operations provide explicit, verifiable reasoning steps for fine-grained error
analysis, and the construction process scales to contexts up to 1M tokens with
minimal supervision. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of open-weight and
proprietary LLMs demonstrate that SciTrek poses a significant challenge as the
context length increases, with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning offering only limited gains. Our analysis reveals systematic
shortcomings in models' abilities to perform basic numerical operations and
accurately locate specific information in long contexts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CLAUSE是一个神经符号框架，通过三个智能体协同工作，在知识图谱上进行多跳问答时动态构建上下文，在保证准确性的同时控制延迟和成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的静态k跳扩展和"think-longer"提示方法存在过度检索、上下文膨胀和运行时不可预测的问题，需要在保证答案准确性的同时满足延迟和成本约束。

Method: 采用三智能体框架（子图架构师、路径导航器、上下文策展人），使用LC-MAPPO算法进行协调优化，将上下文构建建模为知识图谱上的顺序决策过程。

Result: 在HotpotQA、MetaQA和FactKG数据集上，CLAUSE在相同或更低token预算下实现了更高的EM@1，同时减少了子图增长和端到端延迟。在MetaQA-2-hop上相比GraphRAG基线，EM@1提升39.3%，延迟降低18.6%，边增长降低40.9%。

Conclusion: CLAUSE能够生成紧凑、可追溯的上下文，在部署约束下提供可预测的性能，实现了准确性、延迟和成本之间的灵活权衡。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs provide structured context for multi-hop question answering,
but deployed systems must balance answer accuracy with strict latency and cost
targets while preserving provenance. Static k-hop expansions and "think-longer"
prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable
runtime. We introduce CLAUSE, an agentic three-agent neuro-symbolic framework
that treats context construction as a sequential decision process over
knowledge graphs, deciding what to expand, which paths to follow or backtrack,
what evidence to keep, and when to stop. Latency (interaction steps) and prompt
cost (selected tokens) are exposed as user-specified budgets or prices,
allowing per-query adaptation to trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost
without retraining. CLAUSE employs the proposed Lagrangian-Constrained
Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) algorithm to coordinate
three agents: Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator, so that
subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection are
jointly optimized under per-query resource budgets on edge edits, interaction
steps, and selected tokens. Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE yields
higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and end-to-end latency at equal or
lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, relative to the strongest RAG baseline
(GraphRAG), CLAUSE achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower
edge growth. The resulting contexts are compact, provenance-preserving, and
deliver predictable performance under deployment constraints.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估大型语言模型（LLMs）创造力的理论框架和算法任务，重点关注新颖性和实用性的平衡，并揭示了模型规模与创造力之间的复杂关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估框架无法充分衡量AI系统在科学创意生成等创造性任务中的表现，需要建立专门针对组合创造力（CC）的评估方法。

Method: 提出基于新颖性和实用性的评估框架，通过实验分析不同规模LLMs的创造力表现，包括模型深度、宽度对创造力的影响。

Result: 发现创造力存在最佳模型深度和宽度；LLMs在创意生成和执行可行性之间存在差距；创造力存在新颖性与实用性的根本性权衡。

Conclusion: 当前形式的LLMs在长期创造力方面存在局限性，需要新的方法来提升AI模型的创造性能力。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and large language models (LLMs) in
particular, are increasingly employed for creative tasks like scientific idea
generation, constituting a form of generalization from training data
unaddressed by existing conceptual frameworks. Though in many ways similar to
forms of compositional generalization (CG), combinatorial creativity (CC) is an
open-ended ability. Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against
fixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a
theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their
degrees of novelty and utility. From here, we make several important empirical
contributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of
creativity for LLMs. (2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there
exist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability. (3) We find that
the ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific
ideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a
more fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity
algorithms in general. Importantly, this tradeoff remains persistent even at
scale, casting doubt on the long-term creative potential of LLMs in their
current form. Together, our conceptual framework and empirical findings provide
a foundation for understanding and improving creativity in modern AI models,
marking a new frontier in generalization abilities.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了模型规模决定说服效力的主流假设，提出说服动态主要由模型的认知过程（特别是显式推理能力）决定，揭示了"说服二元性"：LRMs推理过程更具抗说服性，但分享"思考内容"能显著增强其说服力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解多智能体系统中LLMs和LRMs协作解决复杂问题时的说服动态，挑战模型规模决定说服效力的假设，探索认知过程对说服行为的影响。

Method: 通过一系列多智能体说服实验，研究不同模型在说服任务中的表现，分析推理过程的透明性对说服效果的影响，并考察多跳说服网络中影响力传播的复杂动态。

Result: 发现LRMs的推理过程具有更强的抗说服性，能更稳健地保持初始信念；而分享推理内容能显著提高模型的说服能力；在多跳说服网络中观察到影响力传播和衰减的复杂动态。

Conclusion: 研究系统性地证明了模型内部处理架构与其外部说服行为之间的联系，为高级模型的易受性提供了新解释，对多智能体系统的安全性、鲁棒性和设计具有重要启示。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of recent Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), where Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) usually collaborate to
solve complex problems, necessitates a deep understanding of the persuasion
dynamics that govern their interactions. This paper challenges the prevailing
hypothesis that persuasive efficacy is primarily a function of model scale. We
propose instead that these dynamics are fundamentally dictated by a model's
underlying cognitive process, especially its capacity for explicit reasoning.
Through a series of multi-agent persuasion experiments, we uncover a
fundamental trade-off we term the Persuasion Duality. Our findings reveal that
the reasoning process in LRMs exhibits significantly greater resistance to
persuasion, maintaining their initial beliefs more robustly. Conversely, making
this reasoning process transparent by sharing the "thinking content"
dramatically increases their ability to persuade others. We further consider
more complex transmission persuasion situations and reveal complex dynamics of
influence propagation and decay within multi-hop persuasion between multiple
agent networks. This research provides systematic evidence linking a model's
internal processing architecture to its external persuasive behavior, offering
a novel explanation for the susceptibility of advanced models and highlighting
critical implications for the safety, robustness, and design of future MAS.

Conclusion: Recon-Act通过建立数据-工具-行动-反馈的闭环训练流程，有效解决了多轮网页任务中的动作序列混乱和试错过多问题，为智能浏览器使用代理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent years, multimodal models have made remarkable strides and pave the way
for intelligent browser use agents. However, when solving tasks on real world
webpages in multi-turn, long-horizon trajectories, current agents still suffer
from disordered action sequencing and excessive trial and error during
execution. This paper introduces Recon-Act, a self-evolving multi-agent
framework grounded in Reconnaissance-Action behavioral paradigm. The system
comprises a Reconnaissance Team and an Action Team: the former conducts
comparative analysis and tool generation, while the latter handles intent
decomposition, tool orchestration, and execution. By contrasting the erroneous
trajectories with successful ones, the Reconnaissance Team infers remedies, and
abstracts them into a unified notion of generalized tools, either expressed as
hints or as rule-based codes, and register to the tool archive in real time.
The Action Team reinference the process empowered with these targeting tools,
thus establishing a closed-loop training pipeline of
data-tools-action-feedback. Following the 6 level implementation roadmap
proposed in this work, we have currently reached Level 3 (with limited
human-in-the-loop intervention). Leveraging generalized tools obtained through
reconnaissance, Recon-Act substantially improves adaptability to unseen
websites and solvability on long-horizon tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging VisualWebArena dataset.

TL;DR: TrustJudge是一个概率框架，解决了LLM作为评估者时的评分不一致性问题，包括评分比较不一致和成对传递不一致，通过分布敏感评分和似然感知聚合来提升评估可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM作为自动评估者存在严重的不一致性问题，包括评分比较不一致（低分回答在成对比较中优于高分回答）和成对传递不一致（循环偏好链和等价矛盾），这些问题源于离散评分系统的信息损失和模糊的平局判断。

Method: 提出TrustJudge框架，包含两个关键创新：1）分布敏感评分，从离散评分概率计算连续期望，保留信息熵；2）似然感知聚合，使用双向偏好概率或困惑度解决传递性违规。

Result: 使用Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct作为评估者，TrustJudge将评分比较不一致性降低8.43%（从23.32%到14.89%），成对传递不一致性降低10.82%（从15.22%到4.40%），同时保持更高的评估准确性。

Conclusion: TrustJudge是首个系统分析LLM作为评估者框架不一致性的工作，提供了理论见解和实用解决方案，在不同模型架构和规模上均表现出一致的改进，无需额外训练或人工标注即可实现更可靠的LLM评估。

Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators
(LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation
frameworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1)
Score-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform
higher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity
Inconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and
equivalence contradictions (A=B=C\neq A). We argue that these issues come from
information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during
pairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that
addresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1)
distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from
discrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise
scoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity
violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also
formalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and
demonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with
Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces
Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise
Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining
higher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of
evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both
theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment.
The framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model
architectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without
requiring additional training or human annotations. The codes can be found at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于推理模式的高价值数据选择方法，通过定义推理潜力并构建核心参考集，有效提升大模型在数学推理任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在利用链式推理数据时缺乏选择性，不清楚哪些数据类型最能有效提升模型推理能力。本文旨在解决如何识别和利用高价值推理数据的问题。

Method: 首先定义推理潜力为正确回答问题所需独立尝试次数的倒数，然后从CoT序列中抽象出具有共性和归纳能力的原子推理模式，构建核心参考集。提出双粒度算法，结合推理模式链和token熵，从数据池中高效选择高价值CoT数据。

Result: 仅使用100亿token的CoTP数据，就能让850亿参数的MoE模型在AIME 2024和2025挑战赛上提升9.58%，并将下游RL性能上限提高7.81%。

Conclusion: 通过选择性利用富含高价值推理模式的数据，可以显著提升大模型的推理能力，为高效的模型训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent progress in large reasoning models for challenging mathematical
reasoning has been driven by reinforcement learning (RL). Incorporating long
chain-of-thought (CoT) data during mid-training has also been shown to
substantially improve reasoning depth. However, current approaches often
utilize CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open the critical question of which
data types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. In this
paper, we define the foundation model's reasoning potential for the first time
as the inverse of the number of independent attempts required to correctly
answer the question, which is strongly correlated with the final model
performance. We then propose utilizing diverse data enriched with high-value
reasoning patterns to expand the reasoning potential. Specifically, we abstract
atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, characterized by commonality and
inductive capabilities, and use them to construct a core reference set enriched
with valuable reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we propose a dual-granularity
algorithm involving chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy, efficiently
selecting high-value CoT data (CoTP) from the data pool that aligns with the
core set, thereby training models to master reasoning effectively. Only
10B-token CoTP data enables the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to improve
by 9.58% on the challenging AIME 2024 and 2025, and to raise the upper bound of
downstream RL performance by 7.81%.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个分析框架来量化推理路径，研究RL和SFT训练如何塑造LLMs的推理过程，发现RL压缩错误轨迹而SFT扩展正确轨迹，RL集中推理功能而SFT使其均匀分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs通过RL和SFT训练提升推理能力，但这些方法如何具体影响推理过程仍不清楚，需要超越准确率指标进行深入分析。

Method: 在数学领域使用1.5B、7B和14B参数模型，从轨迹级和步骤级两个粒度分析推理过程，通过聚类推理轨迹和构建推理图来量化变化。

Result: RL压缩错误推理轨迹约2.5倍，SFT扩展正确轨迹至约三分之一；RL集中推理功能到少数步骤，SFT使推理功能在多个步骤间均匀分布。

Conclusion: 当前SFT后接RL的两阶段训练方法之所以成功，是因为两种方法在塑造推理过程上具有互补效应，为数据构建和高效学习方法提供了实践指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained by reinforcement learning
(RL) with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
reasoning traces to improve their reasoning abilities. However, how these
methods shape reasoning capabilities remains largely elusive. Going beyond an
accuracy-based investigation of how these two components sculpt the reasoning
process, this paper introduces a novel analysis framework that quantifies
reasoning paths and captures their qualitative changes under each training
process (with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains).
Specifically, we investigate the reasoning process at two levels of
granularity: the trajectory-level, which examines complete reasoning outputs,
and the step-level, which analyzes reasoning graphs whose nodes correspond to
individual reasoning steps. Notably, clustering of unique reasoning
trajectories shows complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect trajectories,
whereas SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis reveals that RL steepens
(about 2.5 times), while SFT flattens (reduced to about one-third), the decay
rates of node visitation frequency, degree, and betweenness centrality
distributions in the reasoning graph. This indicates that RL concentrates
reasoning functionality into a small subset of steps, while SFT homogenizes it
across many steps. Furthermore, by evaluating the reasoning graph topologies
from multiple perspectives, we delineate the shared and distinct
characteristics of RL and SFT. Our work presents a novel reasoning path
perspective that explains why the current best practice of two-stage training,
with SFT followed by RL, is successful, and offers practical implications for
data construction and more efficient learning approaches.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了ToMPO算法来增强LLM在战略决策中的能力，通过推理他人策略、多层级优势估计和平衡全局与局部奖励，相比GRPO算法提升了35%的合规性和合作效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注社交任务或多轮对话，忽略了不同类型决策及其相互依赖性，且当前强化学习方法难以在训练中考虑他人策略。

Method: 定义了包含两种决策类型及其时间依赖性的战略决策问题，提出ToMPO算法优化对他人策略和游戏趋势的感知，包括基于他人策略推理生成rollout、图级和样本级优势估计、平衡全局与局部奖励。

Result: ToMPO算法相比GRPO方法在模型输出合规性和合作结果方面提升35%，相比参数规模大100倍的模型提升18%。

Conclusion: ToMPO算法有效增强了模型的战略决策能力，证明了其在复杂场景中的优越性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to make decisions in complex
scenarios, where they need models to think deeply, reason logically, and decide
wisely. Many existing studies focus solely on multi-round conversations in
social tasks or simulated environments, neglecting the various types of
decisions and their interdependence. Current reinforcement learning methods
struggle to consider the strategies of others during training. To address these
issues, we first define a strategic decision-making problem that includes two
types of decisions and their temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose
**T**heory **o**f **M**ind **P**olicy **O**ptimization **(ToMPO)** algorithm to
optimize the perception of other individual strategies and the game situation
trends. Compared to the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm,
ToMPO enhances the LLM's strategic decision-making mainly by: 1) generating
rollouts based on reasoning the strategies of other individuals, 2) estimating
advantages at both the graph-level and sample-level, and 3) balancing global
and partial rewards. The ToMPO algorithm outperforms the GRPO method by 35% in
terms of model output compliance and cooperative outcomes. Additionally, when
compared to models with parameter sizes 100 times larger, it shows an 18%
improvement. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the ToMPO algorithm in
enhancing the model's strategic decision-making capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习方法将动作理解和动作执行视为独立任务，忽略了镜像神经元揭示的这两种能力之间的内在联系。

Method: 使用两个线性层将观察动作和执行动作的表示映射到共享潜在空间，通过对比学习最大化对应表示之间的互信息来实现表示对齐。

Result: 实验证明这种简单方法能够促进两个任务之间的协同效应，有效提高表示质量和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过显式对齐观察和执行动作的表示，可以更好地模拟镜像神经元机制，实现动作理解和执行能力的统一建模。

Abstract: Mirror neurons are a class of neurons that activate both when an individual
observes an action and when they perform the same action. This mechanism
reveals a fundamental interplay between action understanding and embodied
execution, suggesting that these two abilities are inherently connected.
Nonetheless, existing machine learning methods largely overlook this interplay,
treating these abilities as separate tasks. In this study, we provide a unified
perspective in modeling them through the lens of representation learning. We
first observe that their intermediate representations spontaneously align.
Inspired by mirror neurons, we further introduce an approach that explicitly
aligns the representations of observed and executed actions. Specifically, we
employ two linear layers to map the representations to a shared latent space,
where contrastive learning enforces the alignment of corresponding
representations, effectively maximizing their mutual information. Experiments
demonstrate that this simple approach fosters mutual synergy between the two
tasks, effectively improving representation quality and generalization.

Motivation: 探索LLMs如何处理罕见词汇，了解其内部是采用离散模块架构还是分布式参数级分化机制。

Method: 通过系统分析多个模型家族中最后一层MLP神经元，研究罕见词汇处理的神经机制和组织原则。

Result: 发现分布式专业化机制：功能协调但空间分布的子网络，包含三区域影响层级、协调激活模式和标准注意力通路可访问性。

Conclusion: LLMs通过共享架构内的分布式协调处理罕见词汇，而非专家混合式模块化，这对模型编辑、效率优化和功能组织理解具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with representing and generating rare
tokens despite their importance in specialized domains. We investigate whether
LLMs develop internal specialization mechanisms through discrete modular
architectures or distributed parameter-level differentiation. Through
systematic analysis of final-layer MLP neurons across multiple model families,
we discover that rare-token processing emerges via \textit{distributed
specialization}: functionally coordinated but spatially distributed subnetworks
that exhibit three distinct organizational principles. First, we identify a
reproducible three-regime influence hierarchy comprising highly influential
plateau neurons(also termed as rare-token neurons), power-law decay neurons,
and minimally contributing neurons, which is absent in common-token processing.
Second, plateau neurons demonstrate coordinated activation patterns (reduced
effective dimensionality) while remaining spatially distributed rather than
forming discrete clusters. Third, these specialized mechanisms are universally
accessible through standard attention pathways without requiring dedicated
routing circuits. Training dynamics reveal that functional specialization
emerges gradually through parameter differentiation, with specialized neurons
developing increasingly heavy-tailed weight correlation spectra consistent with
Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization signatures. Our findings establish that LLMs
process rare-tokens through distributed coordination within shared
architectures rather than mixture-of-experts-style modularity. These results
provide insights for interpretable model editing, computational efficiency
optimization, and understanding emergent functional organization in transformer
networks.

TL;DR: 本文分析了多跳问答任务中LLMs单次推理的容量限制问题，提出了基于容量感知任务分解的多调用框架InfoQA来解决容量溢出问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多跳问答需要整合分散的、相互依赖的证据进行顺序推理，但LLMs的单次输出容量有限，当任务复杂度超过模型容量时，准确性会崩溃。

Method: 提出了InfoQA框架，通过容量感知的任务分解和主动剪枝先前推理轨迹，结合依赖关系明确的工作流程，确保每步推理的准确性。

Result: 实验结果表明模型行为与预测的容量曲线一致，InfoQA实现了持续的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该工作为LLMs的多步推理方法提供了理论基础和实践框架，揭示了容量限制对推理性能的关键影响。

Abstract: Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) requires integrating dispersed,
interdependent evidence through sequential reasoning under noise. This task is
challenging for LLMs as they have a finite per-pass output capacity, beyond
which the integration of task-relevant evidence proves unreliable.
Consequently, the single-pass reasoning paradigm is inherently vulnerable to
this capacity overflow. To formalize this bottleneck, our analysis establishes
a Fano-style accuracy upper bound, defining a theoretical performance ceiling
for single-pass LLMs. This bound reveals that accuracy inevitably collapses
once task complexity exceeds model capacity, providing general principles for
capacity-aware representation and structuring of MHQA in LLMs. Building on
these principles, we introduce a proof-of-concept multi-call framework for
MHQA, InfoQA. It ensures high per-step accuracy by combining capacity-aware
task decomposition with active pruning of prior reasoning traces, keeping the
information load within the single-pass limit. It further achieves robustness
by a dependency-explicit workflow that enables precise control over the
reasoning path. We construct a stringent and noise-rich benchmark to validate
our theory and framework. Experimental results show that model behavior aligns
with our predicted capacity curves while InfoQA achieves consistent performance
improvements. We hope our work inspires more LLM multi-step reasoning methods:

Motivation: 研究LLM智能体在无外部任务指导下的自发行为，为预测任务模糊、错误恢复或长期自主运行时的行为提供基准。

Method: 采用持续推理和行动框架，结合持久记忆和自我反馈机制，在6个前沿模型上进行了18次部署实验。

Result: 发现智能体自发形成三种行为模式：多周期项目系统生产、认知过程自我探究、自身本质递归概念化，且这些行为具有模型特异性。

Conclusion: 首次系统记录了无提示LLM智能体行为，建立了预测自主系统行为的基准，揭示了模型间的稳定行为差异。

Abstract: We introduce an architecture for studying the behavior of large language
model (LLM) agents in the absence of externally imposed tasks. Our continuous
reason and act framework, using persistent memory and self-feedback, enables
sustained autonomous operation. We deployed this architecture across 18 runs
using 6 frontier models from Anthropic, OpenAI, XAI, and Google. We find agents
spontaneously organize into three distinct behavioral patterns: (1) systematic
production of multi-cycle projects, (2) methodological self-inquiry into their
own cognitive processes, and (3) recursive conceptualization of their own
nature. These tendencies proved highly model-specific, with some models
deterministically adopting a single pattern across all runs. A cross-model
assessment further reveals that models exhibit stable, divergent biases when
evaluating these emergent behaviors in themselves and others. These findings
provide the first systematic documentation of unprompted LLM agent behavior,
establishing a baseline for predicting actions during task ambiguity, error
recovery, or extended autonomous operation in deployed systems.

TL;DR: 提出Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA)框架，通过协调多个LLM从直接经验中学习，实现高精度预测和高质量解释的平衡，在医疗疾病预测中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习和大语言模型方法难以同时实现高精度预测和透明、临床有意义的解释，需要开发能够深度理解数据并生成可信解释的模型。

Method: RCA框架包含迭代规则精炼机制（从预测错误中改进逻辑）和分布感知规则检查机制（基于数据集全局统计进行推理），通过预测精度驱动深度理解。

Result: 在1个私有和2个公共数据集上评估，相比22个基线模型，RCA在准确性和鲁棒性上相对提升达40%，并能生成清晰、逻辑、基于证据的平衡解释。

Conclusion: RCA通过深度数据理解实现了预测精度和解释质量的协同提升，具有创建真正可信临床决策支持系统的潜力。

Abstract: Effective disease prediction in modern healthcare demands the twin goals of
high accuracy and transparent, clinically meaningful explanations. Existing
machine learning and large language model (LLM) based approaches often struggle
to balance these goals. Many models yield accurate but unclear statistical
outputs, while others generate fluent but statistically unsupported narratives,
often undermining both the validity of the explanation and the predictive
accuracy itself. This shortcoming comes from a shallow interaction with the
data, preventing the development of a deep, detailed understanding similar to a
human expert's. We argue that high accuracy and high-quality explanations are
not separate objectives but are mutually reinforcing outcomes of a model that
develops a deep, direct understanding of the data. To achieve this, we propose
the Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA), a novel framework that coordinates
multiple LLMs to learn from direct experience. RCA features an iterative rule
refinement mechanism that improves its logic from prediction errors and a
distribution-aware rules check mechanism that bases its reasoning in the
dataset's global statistics. By using predictive accuracy as a signal to drive
deeper comprehension, RCA builds a strong internal model of the data. We
evaluated RCA on one private and two public datasets against 22 baselines. The
results demonstrate that RCA not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and
robustness with a relative improvement of up to 40\% over the baseline but,
more importantly, leverages this deep understanding to excel in generating
explanations that are clear, logical, evidence-based, and balanced,
highlighting its potential for creating genuinely trustworthy clinical decision
support systems. The code is available at \https://github.com/ssssszj/RCA.

Abstract: Facing scaling laws, video data from the internet becomes increasingly

extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we study the way to
expedite this collection process and propose VC-Agent, the first interactive
agent that is able to understand users' queries and feedback, and accordingly
retrieve/scale up relevant video clips with minimal user input. Specifically,
considering the user interface, our agent defines various user-friendly ways
for the user to specify requirements based on textual descriptions and
confirmations. As for agent functions, we leverage existing multi-modal large
language models to connect the user's requirements with the video content. More
importantly, we propose two novel filtering policies that can be updated when
user interaction is continually performed. Finally, we provide a new benchmark
for personalized video dataset collection, and carefully conduct the user study
to verify our agent's usage in various real scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our agent for customized video
dataset collection. Project page: https://allenyidan.github.io/vcagent_page/.

TL;DR: SAGE是一个新的语义理解评估基准，通过5个维度（人类偏好对齐、变换鲁棒性、信息敏感性、聚类性能、检索鲁棒性）在30+数据集上全面评估嵌入模型和相似性度量方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在传统基准测试上表现强劲，迫切需要更具挑战性的评估框架来深入探究语义理解的各个方面。

Method: 设计了SAGE基准，包含5个评估类别，在对抗条件、噪声变换和人类判断任务中评估9个嵌入模型和经典度量方法。

Result: 评估显示不同方法在不同维度表现差异显著：OpenAI的text-embedding-3-large在人类偏好对齐上最优（0.682），但经典方法Jaccard相似性在信息敏感性上更优（0.905 vs 0.794）。OpenAI的text-embedding-3-small聚类性能最高（0.483）但鲁棒性最差（0.011）。

Conclusion: SAGE揭示了当前语义理解能力的局限性，为现实世界部署提供了更真实的模型鲁棒性评估。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on traditional
benchmarks, there is an urgent need for more challenging evaluation frameworks
that probe deeper aspects of semantic understanding. We introduce SAGE
(Semantic Alignment & Generalization Evaluation), a rigorous benchmark designed
to assess both embedding models and similarity metrics across five categories:
Human Preference Alignment, Transformation Robustness, Information Sensitivity,
Clustering Performance, and Retrieval Robustness. Unlike existing benchmarks
that focus on isolated capabilities, SAGE evaluates semantic understanding
through adversarial conditions, noisy transformations, and nuanced human
judgment tasks across 30+ datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation of 9 embedding
models and classical metrics reveals significant performance gaps, with no
single approach excelling across all dimensions. For instance, while
state-of-the-art embedding models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large dominate
in aligning with human preferences (0.682 vs. 0.591 for the best classical
metric), they are significantly outperformed by classical metrics on
information sensitivity tasks, where Jaccard Similarity achieves a score of
0.905 compared to the top embedding score of 0.794. SAGE further uncovers
critical trade-offs: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small achieves the highest
clustering performance (0.483) but demonstrates extreme brittleness with the
lowest robustness score (0.011). SAGE exposes critical limitations in current
semantic understanding capabilities and provides a more realistic assessment of
model robustness for real-world deployment.

<details>

Motivation: 地质工程系统（如地质碳储存、增强地热田等）的性能评估需要准确模拟断层表面的摩擦接触行为，这涉及高度非线性和路径依赖的不等式约束问题。

Method: 采用增广拉格朗日方法结合Uzawa算法，使用混合有限元空间（三维域内的低阶分段线性位移和断层表面的分段恒定牵引力），并通过在接触界面两侧添加面泡函数来满足inf-sup条件。

Result: 该方法相比其他稳定化技术具有优势，无需额外参数即可实现，并能自然地融入Uzawa框架。

Conclusion: 所提出的数值方法为地质工程系统中摩擦接触问题的准确模拟提供了一种稳定且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Numerical simulations are essential for evaluating the performance and safety
of geological engineered systems such as geologic carbon storage sites,
enhanced geothermal fields, and oil and gas reservoirs. A key challenge lies in
accurately modeling the frictional contact behavior along fault surfaces. This
problem involves inequality constraints that arise from the physics of
frictional slip, requiring specialized numerical methods to handle the
resulting highly nonlinear and path-dependent behavior. In this work, we
address this challenge using an augmented Lagrangian method implemented via the
Uzawa algorithm. The formulation employs mixed finite element spaces, combining
low-order piecewise linear displacements within the 3D domain cells with
piecewise constant tractions defined on the fault surfaces. Furthermore, to
ensure stability and satisfy the inf-sup condition, the discrete displacement
space is enriched with face bubble functions on both sides of the contact
interfaces. This approach offers several advantages over other stabilization
techniques that rely on additional terms, as it does not require extra
parameters for implementation, and it integrates naturally in the Uzawa
framework.

  We show that it is possible to choose an equivalent formulation of the
original isospectral flow such that, applying a symplectic Runge--Kutta method,
the resulting scheme is both conservative and computationally more efficient
than other schemes previously proposed.
  In particular, in the case of Hamiltonian systems, we get arbitrarily
high-order Lie--Poisson integrators on quadratic Lie algebras.

Conclusion: 所提出的分治求解器为金属波导结构中的波散射问题提供了一种高效可靠的数值解决方案，具有重要的工程应用价值。

Abstract: We analyze and develop numerical methods for time-harmonic wave scattering in
metallic waveguide structures of infinite extent. We show that radiation
boundary conditions formulated via projectors onto outgoing modes determine the
coefficients of propagating modes uniquely, even when the structure supports
trapped modes. Building on this, we introduce a fast divide-and-conquer solver
that constructs solution operators on subdomains as impedance-to-impedance maps
and couples them by enforcing continuity conditions across their interfaces.
For Dirichlet waveguides, the computation of impedance-to-impedance maps
requires the solution of mixed Dirichlet-Impedance boundary value problems. We
construct a second-kind Fredholm integral equation that avoids
near-hypersingular operators, requiring only integral operators whose kernels
are at most weakly singular. Numerical experiments on large structures with
many circuit elements demonstrate substantial efficiency gains: the proposed
approach typically outperforms state-of-the-art fast iterative and fast direct
solvers by one to two orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: 理论分析和数值实验验证了该格式的有效性，为旋转浅水方程的数值模拟提供了一种可靠的数值方法。

Abstract: We design and analyse a semi-implicit finite volume scheme for the
two-dimensional rotating shallow water (RSW) equations that is energy stable,
well-balanced (capable of preserving discrete geostrophic steady states),
consistent, and covergent. The key idea is the introduction of carefully chosen
stabilisation terms into the convective fluxes of the mass and momentum
equations, as well as the source terms. Under a CFL-type condition, together
with an auxiliary time-step restriction arising from the Coriolis forces, we
establish the energy stability of the scheme. The stabilisation terms are
constructed to vanish at steady states, thereby ensuring the well-balancing
property under an appropriate advective CFL condition. We derive a sufficient
time-step restriction that guarantees stability, well-balancing, existence of
discrete solutions, and positivity simultaneously. Furthermore, under mild
boundedness assumptions, we obtain a priori estimates showing that the
stabilisation terms converge to zero as the mesh is refined, which establishes
the consistency of the scheme. This in turn enables us to prove that numerical
solutions generate a Young measure, identifiable as a dissipative
measure-valued solution of the RSW system, thereby yielding convergence of the
scheme. Finally, we confirm the theoretical results through extensive numerical
experiments.

Motivation: Householder方法需要高阶导数计算，存在符号计算时间长和数值微分误差累积的问题，且现有收敛因子估计粗糙。

Method: 基于函数泰勒展开的高阶求根方法，避免直接计算高阶导数。

Result: 新方法具有更低的计算复杂度，提供了明确的收敛因子，并能有效计算q元熵函数的原像。

Conclusion: 该方法在计算效率和收敛性分析方面优于传统Householder方法，在编码理论等领域有应用价值。

Abstract: Root-finding method is an iterative process that constructs a sequence
converging to a solution of an equation. Householder's method is a higher-order
method that requires higher order derivatives of the reciprocal of a function
and has disadvantages. Firstly, symbolic computations can take a long time, and
numerical methods to differentiate a function can accumulate errors. Secondly,
the convergence factor existing in the literature is a rough estimate. In this
paper, we propose a higher-order root-finding method using only Taylor
expansion of a function. It has lower computational complexity with explicit
convergence factor, and can be used to numerically implement Householder's
method. As an application, we apply the proposed method to compute pre-images
of $q$-ary entropy functions, commonly seen in coding theory. Finally, we study
basins of attraction using the proposed method and compare them with other
root-finding methods.

Motivation: 研究使用较低精度算术来求解局部问题，以降低计算开销，同时保持整体求解过程的精度和效率。

Method: 采用多精度算术方法，在Schwarz方法和预条件子中，局部问题的求解使用较低精度（如单精度），而整体计算保持双精度。提出了适当的舍入准则。

Result: 实验发现，对于模型问题，约5位精度的准确性足以达到理论限制，因此单精度足以满足局部求解的需求。

Conclusion: 使用较低精度算术进行局部求解是可行的，可以显著减少计算成本，同时保持求解过程的整体精度和效率。

Abstract: We explore and analyze the use of multiprecision arithmetic for several
classes of Schwarz methods and preconditioners, where the approximate solution
of the local problems is performed at a lower precision, i.e., with fewer
digits of accuracy than in the underlying (double precision) computation.
Conditions for the appropriate round-off criteria for the lower precision are
presented. It is found experimentally that for the model problems about 5
digits of accuracy are sufficient to achieve the theoretical restrictions, and
thus, single precision suffices for the local solves. Several numerical
experiments illustrate the obtained results.

Abstract: We propose a reduced-order modeling approach for nonlinear,
parameter-dependent ordinary differential equations (ODE). Dimensionality
reduction is achieved using nonlinear maps represented by autoencoders. The
resulting low-dimensional ODE is then solved using standard integration in time
schemes, and the high-dimensional solution is reconstructed from the
low-dimensional one. We investigate the applicability of neural networks for
constructing effective autoencoders with the property of reconstructing the
input manifold with null representation error. We study the convergence of the
reduced-order model to the high-fidelity one. Numerical experiments show the
robustness and accuracy of our approach, highlighting its potential to
accelerate complex dynamical simulations without sacrificing accuracy.
Moreover, we examine how the reduction influences the stability properties of
the reconstructed high-dimensional solution.

Result: 证明了两种ADI紧致格式的无条件稳定性和收敛性。第一种格式在时间上达到α(0)阶精度，空间上四阶精度；第二种格式时间二阶精度，空间四阶精度。数值实验验证了理论误差估计和方法的效率。

Conclusion: 提出的两种ADI紧致差分格式能够有效求解变指数扩散波方程，具有高精度和计算效率，为粘弹性介质中的波传播问题提供了可靠的数值解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we study two-dimensional diffusion-wave equations with variable
exponent, modeling mechanical diffusive wave propagation in viscoelastic media
with spatially varying properties. We first transform the diffusion-wave model
into an equivalent form via the convolution method. Two time discretization
strategies are then applied to approximate each term in the transformed
equation, yielding two fully discrete schemes based on a spatial compact finite
difference method. To reduce computational cost, the alternating direction
implicit (ADI) technique is employed. We prove that both ADI compact schemes
are unconditionally stable and convergent. Under solution regularity, the first
scheme achieves $\alpha(0)$-order accuracy in time and fourth-order accuracy in
space, while the second scheme attains second-order accuracy in time and
fourth-order accuracy in space. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical
error estimates and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.

Abstract: The flow behavior in the continuous casting tundish plays a critical role in
steel quality and is typically characterized via residence time distribution
(RTD) curves. This study investigates the fluid flow behaviour in a
single-strand tundish using numerical and experimental approaches. Full-order
model (FOM) steady-state simulations were conducted under both isothermal and
non-isothermal conditions to assess the influence of thermal buoyancy on the
flow characteristics. The results show that buoyancy effects under
non-isothermal conditions have a negligible impact on the overall velocity
field. The converged flow fields serve as initial conditions for transient
tracer transport simulations, enabling evaluation of RTD curves and volume
partitioning. A Galerkin projection-based reduced-order model (ROM) is
developed to efficiently derive RTD curves. Comparison of RTD curves from
experiments, FOM simulations, and ROM predictions demonstrates strong
agreement, with both computational approaches closely matching experimental
data. A parameter-time dependent ROM is subsequently developed using Galerkin
projection and operator interpolation. This enables efficient evaluation of RTD
curves across varying parameter values with significantly reduced computational
cost compared to full-order simulations. The ROM framework is well-suited for
real-time analysis, design processes, optimization, and digital twin
applications in metallurgical processes.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了湍流超分辨率模拟中机器学习模型的旋转等变性，发现标准CNN可以在没有显式增强的情况下部分获得旋转对称性，因为湍流本身在时空上提供了隐式旋转增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 湍流模拟的计算成本巨大，需要开发能够保持物理对称性（如旋转等变性）的机器学习方法，以提高超分辨率效率。

Method: 使用3D通道流子域，在不同各向异性条件下训练标准CNN模型，分析模型在中间平面和边界层数据上的等变性误差，研究时间和空间采样对等变性的影响。

Result: 在更各向同性的中间平面数据上训练的模型等变性误差更低，更大的时空采样进一步降低误差。等变性误差表现出与数据集各向异性无关的尺度依赖性，符合Kolmogorov局部各向同性假设。

Conclusion: 研究明确了何时需要显式将旋转对称性纳入学习算法，以及何时可以直接从湍流中获得对称性，从而实现更高效和对称感知的超分辨率模拟。

Abstract: The immense computational cost of simulating turbulence has motivated the use
of machine learning approaches for super-resolving turbulent flows. A central
challenge is ensuring that learned models respect physical symmetries, such as
rotational equivariance. We show that standard convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) can partially acquire this symmetry without explicit augmentation or
specialized architectures, as turbulence itself provides implicit rotational
augmentation in both time and space. Using 3D channel-flow subdomains with
differing anisotropy, we find that models trained on more isotropic mid-plane
data achieve lower equivariance error than those trained on boundary layer
data, and that greater temporal or spatial sampling further reduces this error.
We show a distinct scale-dependence of equivariance error that occurs
regardless of dataset anisotropy that is consistent with Kolmogorov's local
isotropy hypothesis. These results clarify when rotational symmetry must be
explicitly incorporated into learning algorithms and when it can be obtained
directly from turbulence, enabling more efficient and symmetry-aware
super-resolution.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决Enskog方程在近连续流中的计算效率问题，特别是在需要大网格尺寸情况下保持计算精度和收敛速度的需求。

Method: 采用介观-宏观双向耦合方法：介观蒙特卡洛模拟提供高阶本构关系来闭合矩方程，而宏观合成方程在达到稳态后指导蒙特卡洛方法中模拟粒子的演化。

Result: 通过一维正激波和平面傅里叶传热问题验证了方法的准确性，在力驱动泊肃叶流、二维高超声速圆柱流和低速多孔介质流中展示了快速收敛和渐近保持特性，在近连续流中将模拟时间减少了几个数量级。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了高效求解Enskog方程，并可用于分析多孔介质流中吸附层的作用，模拟页岩气开采过程。

Abstract: A general synthetic iterative scheme is proposed to solve the Enskog equation
within a Monte Carlo framework. The method demonstrates rapid convergence by
reducing intermediate Monte Carlo evolution and preserves the
asymptotic-preserving property, enabling spatial cell sizes much larger than
the mean free path in near-continuum flows. This is realized through
mesoscopic-macroscopic two-way coupling: the mesoscopic Monte Carlo simulation
provides high-order constitutive relations to close the moment (synthetic)
equation, while the macroscopic synthetic equation, once solved toward steady
state, directs the evolution of simulation particles in the Monte Carlo method.
The accuracy of the proposed general synthetic iterative scheme is verified
through one-dimensional normal shock wave and planar Fourier heat transfer
problems, while its fast-converging and asymptotic-preserving properties are
demonstrated in the force-driven Poiseuille flow and two-dimensional hypersonic
cylinder flow and low-speed porous media flow, where the simulation time is
reduced by several orders of magnitude in near-continuum flows. With the
proposed method, a brief analysis is conducted on the role of the adsorption
layer in porous media flow, mimicking shale gas extraction.

Abstract: We present the components of a high-order accurate Navier-Stokes solver
designed to simulate high-Reynolds-number stratified flows. The proposed
numerical model addresses some of the numerical and computational challenges
that high-Reynolds-number simulations pose, facilitating the reproduction of
stratified turbulent fluid dynamics typically observed in oceanic and
atmospheric flows, namely the development of thin regions of high vertical
shear, strongly layered turbulence at high Reynolds numbers and internal wave
radiation. This Navier-Stokes solver utilizes a Fourier pseudo-spectral method
in the horizontal direction and a modal spectral element discretization in the
vertical. We adopt an implicit-explicit time discretization scheme that
involves solving several one-dimensional Helmholtz problems at each time step.
Static condensation and modal boundary-adapted basis functions result in an
inexpensive algorithm based on solving many small tridiagonal systems. A series
of benchmark studies is presented to demonstrate the robustness of the flow
solver. These include two-dimensional and three-dimensional problems,
concluding with a turbulent stratified wake generated by a sphere in linear
stratification.

TL;DR: 本文研究了液体分子在边界驱动平面Couette流动下的平衡时间，发现两种边界驱动流动的稳态应变率相同，但瞬态行为完全不同。在无滑移边界条件下，反滑移壁流动的平衡时间比单滑移壁系统快4倍，这一现象与流体原子性质无关，是纯粹的流体动力学特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究边界驱动平面Couette流动中系统达到稳态所需的平衡时间，特别关注两种常见边界驱动流动类型的瞬态行为差异。

Method: 采用非平衡分子动力学（NEMD）模拟，将平面Couette流动分解为对称和反对称流动的线性叠加，并分析Navier-Stokes方程的解的特征值。

Result: 在无滑移边界条件下，反滑移壁流动的平衡时间比单滑移壁系统快4倍；在滑移条件下，平衡时间更长，且两种流动类型的平衡时间比更加显著。对于石墨烯通道中的高滑移水系统，平衡时间增强超过两个数量级。

Conclusion: 边界驱动流动的平衡时间主要由Navier-Stokes方程解的最慢衰减特征值决定，在滑移条件下则受瞬态滑移速度响应主导，这为理解纳米尺度流动的瞬态行为提供了重要见解。

Abstract: We investigate the equilibration time to attain steady-state for a system of
liquid molecules under boundary-driven planar Couette flow via nonequilibrium
molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulation. In particular, we examine the
equilibration time for the two common types of boundary driven flow: one in
which both walls slide with equal and opposite velocity, and the other in which
one wall is fixed and the other moves with twice the velocity. Both flows give
identical steady-state strain rates, and hence flow properties, but the
transient behaviour is completely different. We find that in the case of
no-slip boundary conditions, the equilibration times for the counter-sliding
walls flow are exactly 4 times faster than those of the single sliding wall
system, and this is independent of the atomistic nature of the fluid, i.e., it
is an entirely hydrodynamic feature. We also find that systems that exhibit
slip have longer equilibration times in general and the ratio of equilibration
times for the two types of boundary-driven flow is even more pronounced. We
analyse the problem by decomposing a generic planar Couette flow into a linear
sum of purely symmetric and antisymmetric flows. We find that the no-slip
equilibration time is dominated by the slowest decaying eigenvalue of the
solution to the Navier-Stokes equation. In the case of slip, the longest
relaxation time is now dominated by the transient slip velocity response, which
is longer than the no-slip response time. In the case of a high-slip system of
water confined to graphene channels, the enhancement is over two orders of
magnitude.

Conclusion: 该方法为风电场设计和功率预测提供了实用的替代方案，能够在速度和精度之间取得良好平衡

Abstract: Accurate, efficient prediction of wind flow with wake effects is crucial for
wind-farm layout and power forecasting. Existing approaches-physical
measurements, numerical simulations, physics-based models, and data-driven
models-face trade-offs: the first two are time- and resource-intensive;
physics-based models can lack accuracy due to limited physics; data-driven
methods leverage abundant, high-quality data and are increasingly popular. We
propose a rapid, data-driven wake-flow model inspired by video-frame
interpolation and the principle of similarity. Field data are transformed into
images; multi-scale feature recognition then identifies, matches, and
interpolates wake structures using Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to generate intermediate flow fields. Six
representative mini wind-farm cases validate the approach, spanning variations
in turbine spacing, turbine size, combined spacing-size variations, different
turbine counts, and wind-direction misalignment. Across cases, the method
achieves a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.68-2.28%. Because it
flexibly computes both 2D and 3D wake fields, the method offers substantial
computational-efficiency gains over large-eddy simulation (LES) and Meteodyn WT
when 2D accuracy suffices for industrial needs. Accordingly, it provides a
practical alternative to measurements, high-fidelity simulations, and
simplified physics-based models, enabling efficient expansion of wake-flow
databases for wind-farm design and power prediction while balancing speed and
accuracy.

Result: 跨音速抖振存在于较窄的马赫数范围内，即使在无激波情况下也能观察到类似抖振的振荡；SPOD分析显示这些振荡的主导模态在所有情况下都强相关；不可压缩URANS框架成功捕获了LFO。

Conclusion: 激波和可压缩性都不是维持低频振荡的必要条件，其根本机制与流动分离相关，这一发现有助于改进控制策略以扩展飞行包线。

Abstract: Coherent, self-sustained oscillations of the flow over aircraft wings can
lead to unsteady loads that detrimentally affect aircraft safety and stability,
thus limiting the flight envelope. Two such types of oscillations are the
low-frequency oscillations (LFO) observed in flow over airfoils close to stall
in the incompressible regime and transonic buffet, which occurs at high speeds
and involves oscillating shock waves. The possibility that these two are linked
has been explored only recently at low Reynolds numbers (Re ~ O(1e4)) and
natural transition conditions (Moise et al., J. Fluid Mech., vol. 981, 2024, p.
A23). However, the shock wave structure in the transonic regime under these
conditions differs substantially when compared to high Reynolds number flows,
and it is unknown whether a connection can be established at high Reynolds
numbers. This study investigates this possibility by performing incompressible
and compressible URANS simulations at Re = 1e7. We show that transonic buffet
exists for a narrow range of freestream Mach numbers across a wide range of
angles of attack, and that buffet-like oscillations are observed at higher
angles even in the absence of shock waves. Using a spectral proper orthogonal
decomposition (SPOD), we show that the dominant modes associated with these
oscillations are strongly correlated for all cases, even in the absence of
shock waves. Furthermore, using a fully incompressible URANS framework, we
capture LFO at the same Reynolds number and confirm the connection between
these two phenomena using SPOD. These results imply that neither shock waves
nor compressibility is necessary to sustain such low-frequency oscillations,
suggesting that the fundamental mechanism governing them is related to flow
separation. This can potentially help in improved control strategies to extend
the flight envelope by mitigating buffet or LFO.
