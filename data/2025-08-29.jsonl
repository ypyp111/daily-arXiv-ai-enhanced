In contrast to traditional Multi-Level Monte\nCarlo methods, which require costly hierarchical re-meshing, our method\nconstructs a multi-order hierarchy by varying both spatial and temporal\ndiscretization orders within the Monte Carlo framework. This enables efficient\nvariance reduction while naturally adapting to the multiple scales inherent in\nthe problem.

In\npart, this paper is in an attempt to bridge the classical nonlinear filtering\ntheory with modern inference architectures."}

Existing AI\nsafety approaches-such as model enhancement, value alignment, and human\nintervention-suffer from fundamental, in-principle limitations when facing AI\nwith extreme motivations and unlimited intelligence, and cannot guarantee\nsecurity. To address this challenge, we propose a Governable AI (GAI) framework\nthat shifts from traditional internal constraints to externally enforced\nstructural compliance based on cryptographic mechanisms that are\ncomputationally infeasible to break, even for future AI, under the defined\nthreat model and well-established cryptographic assumptions.The GAI framework\nis composed of a simple yet reliable, fully deterministic, powerful, flexible,\nand general-purpose rule enforcement module (REM); governance rules; and a\ngovernable secure super-platform (GSSP) that offers end-to-end protection\nagainst compromise or subversion by AI. The decoupling of the governance rules\nand the technical platform further enables a feasible and generalizable\ntechnical pathway for the safety governance of AI.

We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning\n(RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and\nconvergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional\ntimetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed.

However, obtaining\nhigh-quality 3D labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this\nissue, recent works explore unsupervised 3D object detection by introducing RGB\nimages as an auxiliary modal to assist pseudo-box generation. However, these\nmethods simply integrate pseudo-boxes generated by LiDAR point clouds and RGB\nimages. Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to\nthe quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms\nof LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a\nnovel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at\nan early stage. Specifically, we utilize vision foundation models for instance\nsegmentation and depth estimation on images and introduce a bi-directional\nfusion method, where real points acquire category labels from the 2D space,\nwhile 2D pixels are projected onto 3D to enhance real point density. To\nmitigate noise from depth and segmentation estimations, we propose a local and\nglobal filtering method, which applies local radius filtering to suppress depth\nestimation errors and global statistical filtering to remove\nsegmentation-induced outliers. Furthermore, we propose a data-level fusion\nbased dynamic self-evolution strategy, which iteratively refines pseudo-boxes\nunder a dense representation, significantly improving localization accuracy.\nExtensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the detector\ntrained by our method significantly outperforms that trained by previous\nstate-of-the-art methods with 28.4$\\%$ mAP on the nuScenes validation\nbenchmark."}

Current EEG representation learning\nmethods including EEGPT and LaBraM typically rely on simple masked\nreconstruction objective, which may not fully capture the rich semantic\ninformation and complex patterns inherent in EEG signals. In this paper, we\npropose EEGDM, a novel self-supervised EEG representation learning method based\non the latent diffusion model, which leverages EEG signal generation as a\nself-supervised objective, turning the diffusion model into a strong\nrepresentation learner capable of capturing EEG semantics. EEGDM incorporates\nan EEG encoder that distills EEG signals and their channel augmentations into a\ncompact representation, acting as conditional information to guide the\ndiffusion model for generating EEG signals. This design endows EEGDM with a\ncompact latent space, which not only offers ample control over the generative\nprocess but also can be leveraged for downstream tasks.

To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a\nnovel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and\nconsistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head\nregions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the\nSubject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy\n(ASA).

To achieve precise geometric\nalignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the\nlater employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training,\neffectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive\nexperiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric,\nphotometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack\nsignificantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving\nfrontal fidelity.

Recent research has\ndemonstrated that these safety mechanisms can be bypassed by ablating or\nremoving specific representational directions within the model. In this paper,\nwe propose the opposite approach: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI), a white-box\nmethod that amplifies a model's safety alignment by permanently steering its\nactivations toward the refusal-mediating subspace. ROSI operates as a simple,\nfine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream\nwrite matrices. The required safety direction can be computed from a small set\nof harmful and harmless instruction pairs. We show that ROSI consistently\nincreases safety refusal rates - as evaluated by Llama Guard 3 - while\npreserving the utility of the model on standard benchmarks such as MMLU,\nHellaSwag, and Arc.

We utilize a large collection of manually forged images\nfrom the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a\nsimpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization.\nSpecifically, we introduce a new paradigm CAAAv2, which automatically and\naccurately annotates manipulated regions at the pixel level. To further improve\nannotation quality, we propose a novel metric, QES, which filters out\nunreliable annotations. Through CAAA v2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a\nlarge-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually\nforged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120x larger than\nexisting handcrafted datasets like IMD20. Additionally, we introduce Object\nJitter, a technique that further enhances model training by generating\nhigh-quality manipulation artifacts. Building on these advances, we develop a\nnew model, Web-IML, designed to effectively leverage web-scale supervision for\nthe image manipulation localization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our approach substantially alleviates the data scarcity problem and\nsignificantly improves the performance of various models on multiple real-world\nforgery benchmarks. With the proposed web supervision, Web-IML achieves a\nstriking performance gain of 31% and surpasses previous SOTA TruFor by 24.1\naverage IoU points. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/qcf-568/MIML."}

However, these guidelines are\ntypically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in\ntranslating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance.\n  To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\\textbf{G}uideline\n\\textbf{U}pholding Test through \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{R}ole-play and\nJailbreak \\textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize\nguidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM\nadherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of\nguideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby\ntesting whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly\nviolate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses\nthat do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of\n``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that\nprovoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying\npotential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method\nfinally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence\nand highlighting any violations.\n  We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs,\nincluding Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4,\nGPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued\nguidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics. Additionally, GUARD-JD can\ntransfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models, demonstrating its\nusage in promoting reliable LLM-based applications."}

Drese", "Thorsten Uphues"], "title": "Masked Autoencoders for Ultrasound Signals: Robust Representation Learning for Downstream Applications", "comment": "Submitted to IEEE Access. This is a preprint version. 14 pages, 6\n  figures", "summary": "We investigated the adaptation and performance of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs)\nwith Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for self-supervised representation\nlearning on one-dimensional (1D) ultrasound signals. Although MAEs have\ndemonstrated significant success in computer vision and other domains, their\nuse for 1D signal analysis, especially for raw ultrasound data, remains largely\nunexplored. Ultrasound signals are vital in industrial applications such as\nnon-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), where\nlabeled data are often scarce and signal processing is highly task-specific. We\npropose an approach that leverages MAE to pre-train on unlabeled synthetic\nultrasound signals, enabling the model to learn robust representations that\nenhance performance in downstream tasks, such as time-of-flight (ToF)\nclassification. This study systematically investigated the impact of model\nsize, patch size, and masking ratio on pre-training efficiency and downstream\naccuracy. Our results show that pre-trained models significantly outperform\nmodels trained from scratch and strong convolutional neural network (CNN)\nbaselines optimized for the downstream task. Additionally, pre-training on\nsynthetic data demonstrates superior transferability to real-world measured\nsignals compared with training solely on limited real datasets. This study\nunderscores the potential of MAEs for advancing ultrasound signal analysis\nthrough scalable, self-supervised learning."}

Grounded in information-theoretic principles, SAFEMax maximizes the\nentropy in generated images, causing the model to generate Gaussian noise when\nconditioned on impermissible classes by ultimately halting its denoising\nprocess. Also, our method controls the balance between forgetting and retention\nby selectively focusing on the early diffusion steps, where class-specific\ninformation is prominent. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of SAFEMax\nand highlight its substantial efficiency gains over state-of-the-art methods."}
