In addition to civil engineering structures, these wind tunnels\ncan also have applications extending towards free-flight aerodynamic tests on\ndrones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Achieving velocity profiles such as\nlinearly sheared flows or boundary layer flows in a traditional wind tunnel\nwould require long fetch lengths for the flow to evolve. However, in this work,\nwith the aid of an array of computer-controlled fans, a perfectly linearly\nsheared flow can be developed at a distance of 1 meter from the source. Unlike\nthe previous fan-array wind tunnels (FAWT) developed for atmospheric boundary\nlayer flows, the fan-array tunnel constructed in this work does not include a\ncontraction section or a honeycomb, offering portability and compactness for\nperforming unconfined flight tests. The current work involves the design and\ndevelopment of a 10 x 10 two-dimensional array of multiple fans facing a 2.4 m\nlong, enclosed test section with a 1.44 $m^2$ cross-sectional area. A\ncomprehensive characterization of key flow parameters, including turbulence\nintensity, mean velocity, and pressure, in the streamwise, spanwise, and\ntransverse directions of the test section is investigated in the developed\nFAWT. These measurements were conducted under three distinct flow conditions,\nnamely uniform, linearly sheared, and parabolic. Additionally, this work also\npresents the evolution of the turbulent length scales and time scales across\nvarious sections inside the tunnel for a range of wind speeds by employing\nautocorrelation techniques and power spectral analysis."}

The\nmajor challenge of this problem is non-uniqueness, which we overcome through a\nreference source technique.

This paper\nrigorously analyze the uniqueness and stability of the recovered statistics of\nthe radiated fields. Afterwards, since the direct problem has a unique mild\nsolution, by examining the expectation and variance of this solution and\ncombined with the phase retrieval formulas, we derive the Fredholm integral\nequations to solve the inverse random source problem (IRSP). We prove the\nstability of the corresponding integral equations.

Second, the actions are not\nfull STRIPS either, as they do not reveal all the objects involved in the\nactions effects and preconditions. Previous approaches have addressed different\nversions of this model learning problem, but most assume that actions in the\ntraces are full STRIPS actions or that the domain predicates are all\nobservable.

For the VAE-based\nmethod, generated samples are then fed through the decoder to then be used in\nsubsequent replay. Experimental results on standard class-incremental\nbenchmarks show that our approach performs competitively with state-of-the-art\nmemory-based methods and outperforms memory-free methods, notably improving\nover best state-of-the-art single class incremental performance on CIFAR-10 and\nCIFAR-100 by nearly $10$\\% and $7$\\%, respectively. Our methodology further\nfacilitates easy visualization of the learning process and can also be utilized\nas a generative model post-training. Results show our method's capability as a\nscalable, task-label-free, and memory-efficient solution for continual\nlearning."}

When\nworking with real images, which are often afflicted with geometric distortions\ncaused by the camera lens, it may be necessary to determine both the homography\nand the lens distortion-particularly the radial component, called radial\ndistortion-simultaneously to obtain anything resembling useful estimates. When\nconsidering a homography with radial distortion between two images, there are\nthree conceptually distinct configurations for the radial distortion; (i)\ndistortion in only one image, (ii) identical distortion in the two images, and\n(iii) independent distortion in the two images. While these cases have been\naddressed separately in the past, the present paper provides a novel and\nunified approach to solve all three cases.

Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the\nnormal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense\nof the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two\nways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather\nthan exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test\nrequires building machines that \"make mistakes\" and display imperfect behavior\njust like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a\nstatistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a\nsingle \"average\" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As\nsuch, the notion of \"average human interrogator\" that Turing talks about in his\noriginal paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical\nabstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of\nmultiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of\nnormal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average\njudgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,\nit argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the\nTuring test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than\nnormal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it\nproposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per\nse. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can\ncontribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether\nthe human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which\nlargely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual\nunderpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to."}

Traditional RGB-based\ndetection methods often fail under such adverse conditions, motivating the need\nfor more robust, modality-agnostic approaches.

In\nthis paper, we show that calibration measures can be misleading indicators of\nthe performance of multi-exit models: a well-calibrated classifier may still\nwaste computation, and common calibration methods do not preserve the sample\nranking within a classifier.

We propose a latent\ndiffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats,\nincluding the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference.\nCompleting the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the\nambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a\nregression-based formulation to predict a single \"mode\" for occluded and\nout-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to\ncapture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem\npartially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background,\nreconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the\ninput views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a\ndistribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single\ninput image.

We propose a\nnovel problem formulation, analyze various minimization techniques, and\ninvestigate key factors influencing their effectiveness. We demonstrate that\nsubstantial inference data reduction is technically feasible without\nsignificant performance loss. However, its practicality is critically\ndetermined by two factors: the technical setting (e.g., performance targets,\nchoice of model) and user characteristics (e.g., history size, preference\ncomplexity). Thus, while we establish its technical feasibility, we conclude\nthat data minimization remains practically challenging and its dependence on\nthe technical and user context makes a universal standard for data `necessity'\ndifficult to implement."}

To address\nthis fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified\ngenerative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal\ndistribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e.\npredicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports\n$3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling.

This paper proposes\nVisual In-Context Prompting~(VICP), a novel framework where models trained on\nseen categories can directly generalize to unseen novel categories using only\n\\textit{in-context examples} as prompts, without requiring parameter\nadaptation. VICP synergizes LLMs and vision foundation models~(VFM): LLMs infer\nsemantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through\ntask-specific prompting, which then guides a VFM (\\eg, DINO) to extract\nID-discriminative features via \\textit{dynamic visual prompts}. By aligning\nLLM-derived semantic concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior, VICP enables\ngeneralization to novel categories, eliminating the need for dataset-specific\nretraining.

In this paper, we are\ninterested in asking: \\textit{What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in\nthe learning process?} To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting\nof various types of unusual atypical data (\\eg sci-fi, animation, \\etc). To\nstudy how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into\nthe model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key\ntasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel\ncategory discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found\nthat even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently\nimprove performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that\nincreasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD\ndetection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more\nsemantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance\ncompared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the\nsemantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to\nunseen action classes.

One\nkey insight widely accepted in the machine learning community is the idea that\nwide basins (regions around a local minimum where the loss increases gradually)\npromote better generalization by offering greater stability to small changes in\ninput data or model parameters. In contrast, sharp minima are typically more\nsensitive and less stable. Motivated by two key empirical observations - the\ninherent heavy-tailed distribution of gradient noise in stochastic gradient\ndescent and the Edge of Stability phenomenon during neural network training, in\nwhich curvature grows before settling at a plateau, we introduce Adaptive Heavy\nTailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD). The algorithm injects\nheavier-tailed noise into the optimizer during the early stages of training to\nenhance exploration and gradually transitions to lighter-tailed noise as\nsharpness stabilizes. By dynamically adapting to the sharpness of the loss\nlandscape throughout training, AHTSGD promotes accelerated convergence to wide\nbasins. AHTSGD is the first algorithm to adjust the nature of injected noise\ninto an optimizer based on the Edge of Stability phenomenon.

Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the\nnormal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense\nof the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two\nways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather\nthan exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test\nrequires building machines that \"make mistakes\" and display imperfect behavior\njust like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a\nstatistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a\nsingle \"average\" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As\nsuch, the notion of \"average human interrogator\" that Turing talks about in his\noriginal paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical\nabstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of\nmultiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of\nnormal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average\njudgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,\nit argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the\nTuring test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than\nnormal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it\nproposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per\nse.

Machine learning-based fact-checking systems have been widely studied\nto mitigate this problem. Among them, ensemble methods are particularly\neffective in combining multiple classifiers to improve robustness. However,\ntheir performance heavily depends on the diversity of the constituent\nclassifiers-selecting genuinely diverse models remains a key challenge,\nespecially when models tend to learn redundant patterns. In this work, we\npropose a novel automatic classifier selection approach that prioritizes\ndiversity, also extended by performance. The method first computes pairwise\ndiversity between classifiers and applies hierarchical clustering to organize\nthem into groups at different levels of granularity. A HierarchySelect then\nexplores these hierarchical levels to select one pool of classifiers per level,\neach representing a distinct intra-pool diversity. The most diverse pool is\nidentified and selected for ensemble construction from these. The selection\nprocess incorporates an evaluation metric reflecting each classifiers's\nperformance to ensure the ensemble also generalises well. We conduct\nexperiments with 40 heterogeneous classifiers across six datasets from\ndifferent application domains and with varying numbers of classes.

However, they remain vulnerable to\nhallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs.\nPrevious video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They\nattribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing\nframes, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these\ncauses indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still\noversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect\noutputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of\nhallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during\nthe process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic\ngroups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to\nincreased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to\nseparate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination.\nTo address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark\ndedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of\nSAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases\nwith semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to\nSAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to\nmitigate SAH.

This allowed better utilization of\nlanguage models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step.

Project Website:\n  https://nishitanand.github.io/line-level-ocr-website", "summary": "Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each\ncharacter and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character\nsegmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in\nsequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first\ndetecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly\noutput full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of\nlanguage models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe\nthat the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word\nsegmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical\nprogression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to\nbypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for\nbetter utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not\nonly improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough\nliterature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark\nsuch shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a\nmeticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level\nannotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy\nimprovement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning\ntowards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4\ntimes improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines.
