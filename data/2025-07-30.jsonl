This constant depletion rate acts as a second invariant,\nalongside the total energy flux, thereby setting the scaling properties of the\nspectrum.

Although CD improves coherence and fluency, its dependence on a single\namateur restricts its capacity to capture the diverse and multifaceted failure\nmodes of language generation, such as repetition, hallucination, and stylistic\ndrift. This paper proposes Multi-Amateur Contrastive Decoding (MACD), a\ngeneralization of the CD framework that employs an ensemble of amateur models\nto more comprehensively characterize undesirable generation patterns. MACD\nintegrates contrastive signals through both averaging and consensus\npenalization mechanisms and extends the plausibility constraint to operate\neffectively in the multi-amateur setting. Furthermore, the framework enables\ncontrollable generation by incorporating amateurs with targeted stylistic or\ncontent biases. Experimental results across multiple domains, such as news,\nencyclopedic, and narrative, demonstrate that MACD consistently surpasses\nconventional decoding methods and the original CD approach in terms of fluency,\ncoherence, diversity, and adaptability, all without requiring additional\ntraining or fine-tuning."}

A remaining significant challenge\nin this task is structural fragmentation, which can adversely impact downstream\napplications. Existing methods primarily focus on designing various loss\nfunctions to constrain global topological structures. However, they often\noverlook local discontinuity regions, leading to suboptimal segmentation\nresults. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Global-to-Local\nConnectivity Preservation (GLCP) framework that can simultaneously perceive\nglobal and local structural characteristics of tubular networks.

In addition, we design a lightweight\nDual-Attention-based Refinement (DAR) module to further improve segmentation\nquality by refining the resulting segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on\nboth 2D and 3D datasets demonstrate that our GLCP achieves superior accuracy\nand continuity in tubular structure segmentation compared to several\nstate-of-the-art approaches.

In this paper, we introduce PDAF, a\nProbabilistic Diffusion Alignment Framework that enhances the generalization of\nexisting segmentation networks through probabilistic diffusion modeling. PDAF\nintroduces a Latent Domain Prior (LDP) to capture domain shifts and uses this\nprior as a conditioning factor to align both source and unseen target domains.\nTo achieve this, PDAF integrates into a pre-trained segmentation model and\nutilizes paired source and pseudo-target images to simulate latent domain\nshifts, enabling LDP modeling. The framework comprises three modules: the\nLatent Prior Extractor (LPE) predicts the LDP by supervising domain shifts; the\nDomain Compensation Module (DCM) adjusts feature representations to mitigate\ndomain shifts; and the Diffusion Prior Estimator (DPE) leverages a diffusion\nprocess to estimate the LDP without requiring paired samples.

Recent advances in large language\nmodels (LLMs) utilize mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanisms to empower multiple\nIMAs, with each LLM trained individually for a specific task that presents\ndifferent business workflows. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on\nmultiple LLMs for IMAs, this paper presents a novel paradigm that accomplishes\nvarious IMAs using a single compositional LLM over wireless networks. The two\nprimary challenges include 1) guiding a single LLM to adapt to diverse IMA\nobjectives and 2) ensuring the flexibility and efficiency of the LLM in\nresource-constrained mobile environments. To tackle the first challenge, we\npropose ContextLoRA, a novel method that guides an LLM to learn the rich\nstructured context among IMAs by constructing a task dependency graph. We\npartition the learnable parameter matrix of neural layers for each IMA to\nfacilitate LLM composition.

We combine these facts to devise a simple\nyet effective sampling strategy: we select examples across tasks using an\ninverse confidence weighting strategy. This produces models comparable to or\nbetter than those trained with more complex sampling procedures, while being\nsignificantly easier to implement and less computationally intensive. Notably,\nour experimental results demonstrate that this method can achieve better\naccuracy than training on the complete dataset (a 4\\% increase in MMLU score).\nAcross various annotation budgets and two instruction finetuning datasets, our\nalgorithm consistently performs at or above the level of the best existing\nmethods, while reducing annotation costs by up to 80\\%."}

A promising\nstrategy is to augment the training data with online synthesized fake images\ncontaining broadly generalizable artifacts. However, in the context of deepfake\ndetection, it is surprising that jointly training on both original and online\nsynthesized forgeries may result in degraded performance. This contradicts the\ncommon belief that incorporating more source-domain data should enhance\ndetection accuracy. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to\ngradient conflicts during backpropagation which force a trade-off between\nsource domain accuracy and target domain generalization. To overcome this\nissue, we propose a Conflict-Suppressed Deepfake Detection (CS-DFD) framework\nthat explicitly mitigates the gradient conflict via two synergistic modules.\nFirst, an Update Vector Search (UVS) module searches for an alternative update\nvector near the initial gradient vector to reconcile the disparities of the\noriginal and online synthesized forgeries. By further transforming the search\nprocess into an extremum optimization problem, UVS yields the uniquely update\nvector, which maximizes the simultaneous loss reductions for each data type.\nSecond, a Conflict Gradient Reduction (CGR) module enforces a low-conflict\nfeature embedding space through a novel Conflict Descent Loss. This loss\npenalizes misaligned gradient directions and guides the learning of\nrepresentations with aligned, non-conflicting gradients. The synergy of UVS and\nCGR alleviates gradient interference in both parameter optimization and\nrepresentation learning. Experiments on multiple deepfake benchmarks\ndemonstrate that CS-DFD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain\ndetection accuracy and cross-domain generalization."}

The goal of this paper is to unravel these\nissues and their connections to uncertainty quantification (UQ) by pursuing a\nline of reasoning motivated by diagnostics. In such settings, prevalence - i.e.\nthe fraction of elements in class - is often of inherent interest. Here we\nanalyze the many interpretations of prevalence to derive a level-set theory of\nclassification, which shows that certain types of self-consistent ML models are\nequivalent to class-conditional probability distributions. We begin by studying\nthe properties of binary Bayes optimal classifiers, recognizing that their\nboundary sets can be reinterpreted as level-sets of pairwise density ratios. By\nparameterizing Bayes classifiers in terms of the prevalence, we then show that\nthey satisfy important monotonicity and class-switching properties that can be\nused to deduce the density ratios without direct access to the boundary sets.\nMoreover, this information is sufficient for tasks such as constructing the\nmulticlass Bayes-optimal classifier and estimating inherent uncertainty in the\nclass assignments. In the multiclass case, we use these results to deduce\nnormalization and self-consistency conditions, the latter being equivalent to\nthe law of total probability for classifiers.

Existing unlearning algorithms depend on the\nremaining data to prevent this issue. As such, these methods are inapplicable\nin a more practical scenario, where only the unlearning samples are available\n(i.e., zero-shot unlearning). This paper presents a novel framework, ZS-PAG, to\nfill this gap. Our approach offers three key innovations: (1) we approximate\nthe inaccessible remaining data by generating adversarial samples; (2)\nleveraging the generated samples, we pinpoint a specific subspace to perform\nthe unlearning process, therefore preventing over-unlearning in the challenging\nzero-shot scenario; and (3) we consider the influence of the unlearning process\non the remaining samples and design an influence-based pseudo-labeling\nstrategy. As a result, our method further improves the model's performance\nafter unlearning.

This approach enables each token to adaptively determine its\nprocessing depth, yielding a flexible and input-dependent allocation of\ncomputational resources. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K and transfer\nbenchmarks demonstrate that MoR-ViT not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy\nwith up to 70% parameter reduction and 2.5x inference acceleration, but also\noutperforms leading efficient ViT baselines such as DynamicViT and TinyViT\nunder comparable conditions. These results establish dynamic recursion as an\neffective strategy for efficient vision transformers and open new avenues for\nscalable and deployable deep learning models in real-world scenarios."}

Our analysis reveals\nthat every stage of the moderation pipeline, from input filtering to output\nvalidation, can be bypassed with accessible strategies. We conclude by\nhighlighting the urgent need for context-aware defenses that reflect the ease\nwith which these jailbreaks can be reproduced in real-world settings."}

LLMs are pre-trained\non vast text data to learn general language patterns, but a subsequent\npost-training phase is critical to align them for specific real-world tasks.\nReinforcement learning (RL) is the leading post-training technique, yet its\neconomic impact remains largely underexplored and unquantified. We examine this\nquestion through the lens of the first deployment of an RL-trained LLM for\ngenerative advertising on Facebook. Integrated into Meta's Text Generation\nfeature, our model, \"AdLlama,\" powers an AI tool that helps advertisers create\nnew variations of human-written ad text. To train this model, we introduce\nreinforcement learning with performance feedback (RLPF), a post-training method\nthat uses historical ad performance data as a reward signal. In a large-scale\n10-week A/B test on Facebook spanning nearly 35,000 advertisers and 640,000 ad\nvariations, we find that AdLlama improves click-through rates by 6.7%\n(p=0.0296) compared to a supervised imitation model trained on curated ads.\nThis represents a substantial improvement in advertiser return on investment on\nFacebook. We also find that advertisers who used AdLlama generated more ad\nvariations, indicating higher satisfaction with the model's outputs. To our\nknowledge, this is the largest study to date on the use of generative AI in an\necologically valid setting, offering an important data point quantifying the\ntangible impact of RL post-training. Furthermore, the results show that RLPF is\na promising and generalizable approach for metric-driven post-training that\nbridges the gap between highly capable language models and tangible outcomes."}

In this\nwork, we introduce a new task paradigm: proactive information gathering, where\nLLMs must identify gaps in the provided context and strategically elicit\nimplicit user knowledge through targeted questions. To systematically study and\ntrain this capability, we design a scalable framework that generates partially\nspecified, real-world tasks, masking key information and simulating authentic\nambiguity.

This work presents the first systematic assessment of honesty\nbehaviors across various MLLMs. We ground honesty in models' response behaviors\nto unanswerable visual questions, define four representative types of such\nquestions, and construct MoHoBench, a large-scale MMLM honest benchmark,\nconsisting of 12k+ visual question samples, whose quality is guaranteed by\nmulti-stage filtering and human verification.

Many existing solutions rely on\ncomputationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency\nand are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as\nintelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent\naccidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph\nlearning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining\nhigh accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting\nstreaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark\ndetection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data\nprocessing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a\nfeature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network\nis then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low\nlatency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs\ncompetitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and\nlatency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods.

Among these applications, fundus image analysis\npresents special challenges, including small lesion areas in certain fundus\ndiseases and subtle inter-disease differences, which can lead to reduced\nprediction accuracy and overfitting in the models. To address these challenges,\nthis paper proposes the Transformer-based model SwinECAT, which combines the\nShifted Window (Swin) Attention with the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA)\nAttention. SwinECAT leverages the Swin Attention mechanism in the Swin\nTransformer backbone to effectively capture local spatial structures and\nlong-range dependencies within fundus images. The lightweight ECA mechanism is\nincorporated to guide the SwinECAT's attention toward critical feature\nchannels, enabling more discriminative feature representation. In contrast to\nprevious studies that typically classify fundus images into 4 to 6 categories,\nthis work expands fundus disease classification to 9 distinct types, thereby\nenhancing the granularity of diagnosis. We evaluate our method on the Eye\nDisease Image Dataset (EDID) containing 16,140 fundus images for 9-category\nclassification. Experimental results demonstrate that SwinECAT achieves 88.29\\%\naccuracy, with weighted F1-score of 0.88 and macro F1-score of 0.90.
