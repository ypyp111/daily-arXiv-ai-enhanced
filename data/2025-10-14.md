*Khartik Uppalapati,Bora Yimenicioglu,Shakeel Abdulkareem,Adan Eftekhari,Bhavya Uppalapati,Viraj Kamath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TinyViT-Batten框架，使用少量样本的Vision Transformer检测儿童Batten病的早期MRI征象，在79例确诊患者和90例对照数据上达到91%准确率和0.95 AUC。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Batten病是一种罕见儿科神经退行性疾病，早期MRI征象细微易被漏诊，需要开发能够从有限训练样本中检测早期病变的AI方法。

Method: 将大型教师ViT蒸馏为500万参数的TinyViT，使用基于度量的少样本学习（原型损失，5-shot episodes）进行微调，并集成Grad-CAM提供可解释性。

Result: 在多中心数据集上达到约91%准确率，ROC曲线下面积至少0.95，灵敏度>90%，特异性约90%，优于3D-ResNet和Swin-Tiny基线模型。

Conclusion: 模型的小尺寸和强性能展示了实用的AI解决方案，可用于早期Batten病检测，并提供了可解释的预测结果。

Abstract: Batten disease (neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis) is a rare pediatric
neurodegenerative disorder whose early MRI signs are subtle and often missed.
We propose TinyViT-Batten, a few-shot Vision Transformer (ViT) framework to
detect early Batten disease from pediatric brain MRI with limited training
cases. We distill a large teacher ViT into a 5 M-parameter TinyViT and
fine-tune it using metric-based few-shot learning (prototypical loss with
5-shot episodes). Our model achieves high accuracy (approximately 91%) and area
under ROC of at least 0.95 on a multi-site dataset of 79 genetically confirmed
Batten-disease MRIs (27 CLN3 from the Hochstein natural-history study, 32 CLN2
from an international longitudinal cohort, 12 early-manifestation CLN2 cases
reported by Cokal et al., and 8 public Radiopaedia scans) together with 90
age-matched controls, outperforming a 3D-ResNet and Swin-Tiny baseline. We
further integrate Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to
highlight disease-relevant brain regions, enabling explainable predictions. The
model's small size and strong performance (sensitivity greater than 90%,
specificity approximately 90%) demonstrates a practical AI solution for early
Batten disease detection.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the Ultralytics YOLO(You Only
Look Once) family of object detectors, focusing the architectural evolution,
benchmarking, deployment perspectives, and future challenges. The review begins
with the most recent release, YOLO26 (YOLOv26), which introduces key
innovations including Distribution Focal Loss (DFL) removal, native NMS-free
inference, Progressive Loss Balancing (ProgLoss), Small-Target-Aware Label
Assignment (STAL), and the MuSGD optimizer for stable training. The progression
is then traced through YOLO11, with its hybrid task assignment and
efficiency-focused modules; YOLOv8, which advanced with a decoupled detection

Precision, and inference speed are analyzed to highlight trade-offs between
accuracy and efficiency. Deployment and application perspectives are further
discussed, covering export formats, quantization strategies, and real-world use
in robotics, agriculture, surveillance, and manufacturing. Finally, the paper
identifies challenges and future directions, including dense-scene limitations,
hybrid CNN-Transformer integration, open-vocabulary detection, and edge-aware
training approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分析领域面临数据可用性和数据置信度的挑战，现有方法在数据充足时表现良好，但在数据有限时效果受限。

Method: TreeNet通过整合神经网络、集成学习和基于树的决策模型的关键特征，构建了一个分层决策集成学习框架。

Abstract: Within the domain of medical image analysis, three distinct methodologies
have demonstrated commendable accuracy: Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and
Ensemble-Based Learning Algorithms, particularly in the specialized context of
genstro institutional track abnormalities detection. These approaches exhibit
efficacy in disease detection scenarios where a substantial volume of data is
available. However, the prevalent challenge in medical image analysis pertains
to limited data availability and data confidence. This paper introduces
TreeNet, a novel layered decision ensemble learning methodology tailored for
medical image analysis. Constructed by integrating pivotal features from neural
networks, ensemble learning, and tree-based decision models, TreeNet emerges as
a potent and adaptable model capable of delivering superior performance across
diverse and intricate machine learning tasks. Furthermore, its interpretability
and insightful decision-making process enhance its applicability in complex
medical scenarios. Evaluation of the proposed approach encompasses key metrics
including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and training and evaluation time. The
methodology resulted in an F1-score of up to 0.85 when using the complete
training data, with an F1-score of 0.77 when utilizing 50\% of the training
data. This shows a reduction of F1-score of 0.08 while in the reduction of 50\%
of the training data and training time. The evaluation of the methodology
resulted in the 32 Frame per Second which is usable for the realtime
applications. This comprehensive assessment underscores the efficiency and
usability of TreeNet in the demanding landscape of medical image analysis
specially in the realtime analysis.

### [4] [OmniSAT: Compact Action Token, Faster Auto Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09667)
*Huaihai Lyu,Chaofan Chen,Senwei Xie,Pengwei Wang,Xiansheng Chen,Shanghang Zhang,Changsheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Omni Swift Action Tokenizer (OmniSAT)，通过B样条编码和多阶段残差量化学习紧凑可迁移的动作表示，将训练序列缩短6.8倍，并开发跨具身学习策略利用异构演示数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归VLA模型在处理长序列高维动作时面临效率问题，先前基于熵和词频的压缩方法存在重建质量差或压缩效率低的问题。

Method: 使用B样条编码归一化值范围和时间跨度，对位置、旋转和夹爪子空间应用多阶段残差量化，生成具有粗细粒度的压缩离散标记。

Result: 在Droid数据集上预训练后，离散标记化将训练序列缩短6.8倍，降低目标熵，在真实机器人和仿真实验中实现更高压缩同时保持重建质量。

Conclusion: OmniSAT在保持重建质量的同时实现高效压缩，使自回归训练收敛更快且模型性能更好，并通过跨具身学习策略扩展了异构演示数据的利用潜力。

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models can be broadly categorized into
diffusion-based and auto-regressive (AR) approaches: diffusion models capture
continuous action distributions but rely on computationally heavy iterative
denoising. In contrast, AR models enable efficient optimization and flexible
sequence construction, making them better suited for large-scale pretraining.
To further improve AR efficiency, particularly when action chunks induce
extended and high-dimensional sequences, prior work applies entropy-guided and
token-frequency techniques to shorten the sequence length. However, such
compression struggled with \textit{poor reconstruction or inefficient
compression}. Motivated by this, we introduce an Omni Swift Action Tokenizer,
which learns a compact, transferable action representation. Specifically, we
first normalize value ranges and temporal horizons to obtain a consistent
representation with B-Spline encoding. Then, we apply multi-stage residual
quantization to the position, rotation, and gripper subspaces, producing
compressed discrete tokens with coarse-to-fine granularity for each part. After
pre-training on the large-scale dataset Droid, the resulting discrete
tokenization shortens the training sequence by 6.8$\times$, and lowers the
target entropy. To further explore the potential of OmniSAT, we develop a
cross-embodiment learning strategy that builds on the unified action-pattern
space and jointly leverages robot and human demonstrations. It enables scalable
auxiliary supervision from heterogeneous egocentric videos. Across diverse
real-robot and simulation experiments, OmniSAT encompasses higher compression
while preserving reconstruction quality, enabling faster AR training
convergence and model performance.

### [5] [Knowledge-Aware Mamba for Joint Change Detection and Classification from MODIS Times Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09679)
*Zhengsen Xu,Yimin Zhu,Zack Dewis,Mabel Heffring,Motasem Alkayid,Saeid Taleghanidoozdoozan,Lincoln Linlin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的知识感知Mamba模型（KAMamba）用于增强MODIS变化检测，通过知识驱动的转移矩阵、多任务学习和时空谱Mamba模块解决了MODIS数据中的混合像素、信息耦合和背景异质性等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MODIS时间序列变化检测对于环境监测至关重要，但由于混合像素、空间-光谱-时间信息耦合效应以及背景类别异质性等关键MODIS困难，这是一项极具挑战性的任务。

Method: 设计了知识驱动的转移矩阵引导方法（KAT-loss）、多任务学习方法（PreC-loss、PostC-loss、Chg-loss）、空间-光谱-时间Mamba模块（SSTMamba）以及稀疏可变形Mamba骨干网络（SDMamba）。

Result: 在加拿大萨斯喀彻温省的MODIS时间序列数据集上评估，变化检测的平均F1得分比基线提高约1.5-6%，LULC分类的OA、AA和Kappa指标提高约2%。

Conclusion: KAMamba模型通过整合领域知识和先进的Mamba架构，有效提升了MODIS变化检测和土地覆盖分类的性能。

Abstract: Although change detection using MODIS time series is critical for
environmental monitoring, it is a highly challenging task due to key MODIS
difficulties, e.g., mixed pixels, spatial-spectral-temporal information
coupling effect, and background class heterogeneity. This paper presents a
novel knowledge-aware Mamba (KAMamba) for enhanced MODIS change detection, with
the following contributions. First, to leverage knowledge regarding class
transitions, we design a novel knowledge-driven transition-matrix-guided
approach, leading to a knowledge-aware transition loss (KAT-loss) that can
enhance detection accuracies. Second, to improve model constraints, a
multi-task learning approach is designed, where three losses, i.e., pre-change
classification loss (PreC-loss), post-change classification loss (PostC-loss),
and change detection loss (Chg-loss) are used for improve model learning.
Third, to disentangle information coupling in MODIS time series, novel
spatial-spectral-temporal Mamba (SSTMamba) modules are designed. Last, to
improve Mamba model efficiency and remove computational cost, a sparse and
deformable Mamba (SDMamba) backbone is used in SSTMamba. On the MODIS
time-series dataset for Saskatchewan, Canada, we evaluate the method on
land-cover change detection and LULC classification; results show about 1.5-6%
gains in average F1 for change detection over baselines, and about 2%
improvements in OA, AA, and Kappa for LULC classification.

### [6] [NNDM: NN_UNet Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09681)
*Sashank Makanaboyina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出NNDM混合框架，结合NN-UNet和扩散模型，通过迭代去噪过程提升脑肿瘤MRI分割的边界精度和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNN模型如U-Net在脑肿瘤MRI分割中存在泛化能力不足、边界精度差和数据多样性有限的问题。

Method: 集成NN-UNet的鲁棒特征提取和扩散模型的生成能力，通过扩散模型学习预测分割掩码与真实掩码之间的残差误差分布，进行迭代去噪优化。

Result: 在BraTS 2021数据集上，NNDM相比传统U-Net和基于transformer的基线方法，在Dice系数和Hausdorff距离指标上表现更优，增强了跨模态和肿瘤子区域的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NNDM为确定性分割网络与随机扩散模型的结合开辟了新方向，推进了自动化脑肿瘤分析的技术水平。

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) are critical for effective diagnosis and treatment planning.
Despite advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as U-Net,
existing models often struggle with generalization, boundary precision, and
limited data diversity. To address these challenges, we propose NNDM (NN\_UNet
Diffusion Model)a hybrid framework that integrates the robust feature
extraction of NN-UNet with the generative capabilities of diffusion
probabilistic models. In our approach, the diffusion model progressively
refines the segmentation masks generated by NN-UNet by learning the residual
error distribution between predicted and ground-truth masks. This iterative
denoising process enables the model to correct fine structural inconsistencies
and enhance tumor boundary delineation. Experiments conducted on the BraTS 2021
datasets demonstrate that NNDM achieves superior performance compared to
conventional U-Net and transformer-based baselines, yielding improvements in
Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance metrics. Moreover, the diffusion-guided
refinement enhances robustness across modalities and tumor subregions. The
proposed NNDM establishes a new direction for combining deterministic
segmentation networks with stochastic diffusion models, advancing the state of
the art in automated brain tumor analysis.

*Thi Bich Phuong Man,Luu Tu Nguyen,Vu Tram Anh Khuong,Thanh Ha Le,Thi Duyen Ngo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新的微表情识别方法，包含两种互补表示（时间排序动态图像和运动强度动态图像）和自适应融合网络，在多个基准数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情具有极低强度且难以被肉眼察觉，但在谎言检测、行为分析和心理评估中具有重要价值，需要开发更有效的识别方法。

Method: 提出两种互补表示：时间排序动态图像强调时间进展，运动强度动态图像通过帧重排序机制突出细微运动；设计自适应融合网络自动学习最优融合策略。

Result: 在CASME-II数据集上达到93.95%准确率和0.897 UF1，在SAMM上达到82.47%准确率和0.665 UF1，在MMEW上达到76.00%准确率，均表现优异。

Conclusion: 所提出的输入表示和网络架构在提升微表情识别性能中起重要作用，为情感计算、谎言检测和人机交互等领域的进一步研究和应用奠定基础。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are subtle, transient facial changes with very low
intensity, almost imperceptible to the naked eye, yet they reveal a person
genuine emotion. They are of great value in lie detection, behavioral analysis,
and psychological assessment. This paper proposes a novel MER method with two
main contributions. First, we propose two complementary representations -
Temporal-ranked dynamic image, which emphasizes temporal progression, and
Motion-intensity dynamic image, which highlights subtle motions through a frame
reordering mechanism incorporating motion intensity. Second, we propose an
Adaptive fusion network, which automatically learns to optimally integrate
these two representations, thereby enhancing discriminative ME features while
suppressing noise. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (CASME-II, SAMM and
MMEW) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. Specifically, AFN
achieves 93.95 Accuracy and 0.897 UF1 on CASME-II, setting a new
state-of-the-art benchmark. On SAMM, the method attains 82.47 Accuracy and
0.665 UF1, demonstrating more balanced recognition across classes. On MMEW, the
model achieves 76.00 Accuracy, further confirming its generalization ability.
The obtained results show that both the input and the proposed architecture
play important roles in improving the performance of MER. Moreover, they
provide a solid foundation for further research and practical applications in
the fields of affective computing, lie detection, and human-computer
interaction.

Abstract: Connected Vision Systems (CVS) are transforming a variety of applications,
including autonomous vehicles, smart cities, surveillance, and human-robot
interaction. These systems harness multi-view multi-camera (MVMC) data to
provide enhanced situational awareness through the integration of MVMC
tracking, re-identification (Re-ID), and action understanding (AU). However,
deploying CVS in real-world, dynamic environments presents a number of
challenges, particularly in addressing occlusions, diverse viewpoints, and
environmental variability. Existing surveys have focused primarily on isolated
tasks such as tracking, Re-ID, and AU, often neglecting their integration into
a cohesive system. These reviews typically emphasize single-view setups,
overlooking the complexities and opportunities provided by multi-camera
collaboration and multi-view data analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this
survey is the first to offer a comprehensive and integrated review of MVMC that
unifies MVMC tracking, Re-ID, and AU into a single framework. We propose a
unique taxonomy to better understand the critical components of CVS, dividing
it into four key parts: MVMC tracking, Re-ID, AU, and combined methods. We
systematically arrange and summarize the state-of-the-art datasets,
methodologies, results, and evaluation metrics, providing a structured view of
the field's progression. Furthermore, we identify and discuss the open research
questions and challenges, along with emerging technologies such as lifelong
learning, privacy, and federated learning, that need to be addressed for future
advancements. The paper concludes by outlining key research directions for
enhancing the robustness, efficiency, and adaptability of CVS in complex,
real-world applications. We hope this survey will inspire innovative solutions
and guide future research toward the next generation of intelligent and
adaptive CVS.

### [9] [Constructive Distortion: Improving MLLMs with Attention-Guided Image Warping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09741)
*Dwip Dalal,Gautam Vashishtha,Utkarsh Mishra,Jeonghwan Kim,Madhav Kanda,Hyeonjeong Ha,Svetlana Lazebnik,Heng Ji,Unnat Jain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttWarp是一种轻量级方法，通过多模态大语言模型的跨模态注意力对输入图像进行直线扭曲，在不改变模型权重或架构的情况下重新分配空间分辨率到模型认为重要的区域，从而提高细粒度感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在杂乱场景中经常遗漏小细节和空间关系，导致细粒度感知定位错误。

Method: 使用MLLM的跨模态注意力对输入图像进行直线扭曲，将更多分辨率分配给查询相关内容，同时压缩信息量较少的区域，同时保持全局上下文。

Result: 在五个基准测试和四个MLLM上，AttWarp持续提高准确性，增强组合推理能力，减少幻觉，优于四个竞争基线方法。

Conclusion: 注意力引导的扭曲优先考虑与查询相关的信息，同时保留上下文，相同的MLLM在接收这种扭曲输入时表现更好。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often miss small details and spatial
relations in cluttered scenes, leading to errors in fine-grained perceptual
grounding. We introduce AttWarp, a lightweight method that allocates more
resolution to query-relevant content while compressing less informative areas,
all while preserving global context. At test time, the approach uses an MLLM's
cross-modal attention to perform rectilinear warping of the input image,
reallocating spatial resolution toward regions the model deems important,
without changing model weights or architecture. This attention-guided warping
preserves all original image information but redistributes it non-uniformly, so
small objects and subtle relationships become easier for the same model to read
while the global layout remains intact. Across five benchmarks (TextVQA, GQA,
DocVQA, POPE, MMMU) and four MLLMs (LLaVA, Qwen-VL, InternVL, and
InstructBLIP), AttWarp consistently improves accuracy, strengthens
compositional reasoning, and reduces hallucinations, outperforming four
competitive baselines that manipulate raw images at test time. Together, these
results show that attention-guided warping prioritizes information relevant to
the query while preserving context, and that the same MLLMs perform better when
given such warped inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在多模态语境（图像+句子）中学习外语词汇的新方法，了解哪些特征能帮助学习者成功推断陌生词汇含义

Method: 通过人类参与者实验，使用不同的图像-文本配对，分析数据特征（图像和文本）与参与者推断成功的关系，以及参与者语言背景的影响

Result: 发现只有部分直观特征与参与者表现有强相关性，需要进一步研究预测性特征；AI系统在预测参与者表现方面显示出改进潜力

Conclusion: 多模态外语学习环境具有研究价值，但需要更深入探索预测学习者成功的特征，AI系统在这一领域的推理能力有提升空间

Abstract: We investigate a new setting for foreign language learning, where learners
infer the meaning of unfamiliar words in a multimodal context of a sentence
describing a paired image. We conduct studies with human participants using
different image-text pairs. We analyze the features of the data (i.e., images
and texts) that make it easier for participants to infer the meaning of a
masked or unfamiliar word, and what language backgrounds of the participants
correlate with success. We find only some intuitive features have strong
correlations with participant performance, prompting the need for further
investigating of predictive features for success in these tasks. We also
analyze the ability of AI systems to reason about participant performance, and
discover promising future directions for improving this reasoning ability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应确定视觉语言任务最优分辨率的方法，并通过参数高效微调技术扩展预训练VLLM的视觉输入分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉大语言模型(VLLM)假设固定分辨率处理下游任务，导致性能不佳，需要根据不同任务的感知粒度需求自适应调整分辨率。

Method: 首先研究不同视觉语言任务的分辨率偏好，提出结合图像复杂度和VLLM不确定性方差的经验公式确定最优分辨率；然后提出参数高效微调技术扩展预训练VLLM的视觉输入分辨率。

Result: 在多种视觉语言任务上的广泛实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够自适应确定不同视觉语言任务的最优分辨率，并通过微调技术有效扩展VLLM的视觉输入能力。

Abstract: Real-world vision-language applications demand varying levels of perceptual
granularity. However, most existing visual large language models (VLLMs), such
as LLaVA, pre-assume a fixed resolution for downstream tasks, which leads to
subpar performance. To address this problem, we first conduct a comprehensive
and pioneering investigation into the resolution preferences of different
vision-language tasks, revealing a correlation between resolution preferences
with image complexity, and uncertainty variance of the VLLM at different image
input resolutions. Building on this insight, we propose an empirical formula to
determine the optimal resolution for a given vision-language task, combining
these two factors. Second, based on rigorous experiments, we propose a novel
parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique to extend the visual input resolution
of pre-trained VLLMs to the identified optimal resolution. Extensive
experiments on various vision-language tasks validate the effectiveness of our
method.

a suitable Conditional Random Field (CRF) to achieve better clarity in a

*David Benavente-Rios,Juan Ruiz Rodriguez,Gustavo Gatica*

TL;DR: 使用合成人脸数据增强单形态攻击检测，通过增量测试协议评估泛化能力，发现适度添加合成数据可改善性能，但仅使用合成数据会导致最差结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决由于隐私问题导致真实人脸图像数据集规模有限的问题，探索合成数据在单形态攻击检测中的应用潜力。

Method: 采用多种形态生成工具和跨数据集评估方案，实施增量测试协议来评估随着合成图像添加而变化的泛化能力。

Result: 实验结果显示，通过精心控制合成图像数量或逐步添加真实图像可以改善泛化能力，但无差别使用合成数据会导致次优性能，仅使用合成数据时获得最高的等错误率。

Conclusion: 在操作场景中，最佳选择不是仅依赖合成数据进行单形态攻击检测，需要谨慎控制合成数据的使用比例。

Abstract: This paper investigates the use of synthetic face data to enhance
Single-Morphing Attack Detection (S-MAD), addressing the limitations of
availability of large-scale datasets of bona fide images due to privacy
concerns. Various morphing tools and cross-dataset evaluation schemes were
utilized to conduct this study. An incremental testing protocol was implemented
to assess the generalization capabilities as more and more synthetic images
were added. The results of the experiments show that generalization can be
improved by carefully incorporating a controlled number of synthetic images
into existing datasets or by gradually adding bona fide images during training.
However, indiscriminate use of synthetic data can lead to sub-optimal
performance. Evenmore, the use of only synthetic data (morphed and non-morphed
images) achieves the highest Equal Error Rate (EER), which means in operational

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Ceb的新型像素聚类方法，利用细胞边界特征和标签将前景像素划分为细胞实例，在六个数据集上的实验表明Ceb优于现有的像素聚类方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于深度学习的细胞实例分割方法使用像素级目标（如距离图、热扩散图等）可能会丢失细胞实例的重要几何属性（如形状、曲率、凸性），这些属性需要像素集合来表示。

Method: Ceb首先从语义分割概率图中提取潜在的前景-前景边界，为每个边界候选构建边界特征表示（边界签名），使用边界分类器预测其二元边界标签，最后基于预测的边界标签通过划分或合并相邻区域获得细胞实例。

Result: 在六个数据集上的广泛实验表明，Ceb在语义分割概率图上优于现有的像素聚类方法，并且与最先进的细胞实例分割方法相比达到了高度竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: Ceb方法通过利用细胞边界特征有效解决了像素级目标可能丢失几何属性的问题，在细胞实例分割任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for cell instance segmentation are based on
deep learning (DL) semantic segmentation approaches, focusing on distinguishing
foreground pixels from background pixels. In order to identify cell instances
from foreground pixels (e.g., pixel clustering), most methods decompose
instance information into pixel-wise objectives, such as distances to
foreground-background boundaries (distance maps), heat gradients with the
center point as heat source (heat diffusion maps), and distances from the
center point to foreground-background boundaries with fixed angles (star-shaped
polygons). However, pixel-wise objectives may lose significant geometric
properties of the cell instances, such as shape, curvature, and convexity,
which require a collection of pixels to represent. To address this challenge,
we present a novel pixel clustering method, called Ceb (for Cell boundaries),
to leverage cell boundary features and labels to divide foreground pixels into
cell instances. Starting with probability maps generated from semantic
segmentation, Ceb first extracts potential foreground-foreground boundaries
with a revised Watershed algorithm. For each boundary candidate, a boundary
feature representation (called boundary signature) is constructed by sampling
pixels from the current foreground-foreground boundary as well as the
neighboring background-foreground boundaries. Next, a boundary classifier is
used to predict its binary boundary label based on the corresponding boundary
signature. Finally, cell instances are obtained by dividing or merging
neighboring regions based on the predicted boundary labels. Extensive
experiments on six datasets demonstrate that Ceb outperforms existing pixel
clustering methods on semantic segmentation probability maps. Moreover, Ceb
achieves highly competitive performance compared to SOTA cell instance
segmentation methods.

*Zhi Chen,Xin Yu,Xiaohui Tao,Yan Li,Zi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CAPEL框架，通过聚类感知的提示集成学习来改进视觉语言模型的零样本迁移性能，避免传统特征平均导致的类别中心偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的提示集成方法通过平均文本特征来代表类别，但这种方法会使得类别中心偏离真实分布，导致次优结果。

Method: CAPEL框架将图像分类到不同的类别聚类中，每个聚类由不同的提示表示；在分类logits空间进行集成而非特征空间；引入聚类保持正则化项；采用自适应提示权重技术。

Result: 该方法能更好地对齐视觉特征分布，保持提示的区分性，并动态调整有缺陷或模糊提示的权重。

Conclusion: CAPEL框架通过聚类感知的提示集成学习，有效提升了视觉语言模型在零样本迁移任务中的性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve zero-shot transfer across
various tasks by pre-training on numerous image-text pairs. These models often
benefit from using an ensemble of context prompts to represent a class. Despite
being effective, conventional prompt ensembling that averages textual features
of context prompts often yields suboptimal results. This is because feature
averaging shifts the class centroids away from the true class distribution. To
address this issue, we propose the Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning
(CAPEL) framework, which preserves the cluster nature of context prompts. CAPEL
classifies images into one of several class clusters, each represented by a
distinct prompt. Instead of ensembling prompts in the feature space, we perform
ensembling in the classification logits space, aligning better with the visual
feature distribution. To further optimize prompt fine-tuning while maintaining
cluster-specific discriminative power, we introduce a cluster-preserving
regularization term. This ensures that prompts remain distinct and specialized
for different clusters, preventing collapse into a uniform direction.
Additionally, we integrate an adaptive prompt weighting technique to
dynamically adjust the attention weights for flawed or ambiguous prompts,
ensuring robust performance across diverse datasets and tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种多目标跟踪方法，使用自监督编码器融合深度和掩码特征来生成稳定的对象表示，替代计算密集的掩码IoU，在复杂场景中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MOT方法依赖IoU进行关联，但在对象相似或遮挡时不可靠，且计算分割掩码IoU计算成本高。

Method: 融合深度和掩码特征，通过自监督训练的紧凑编码器生成对象表示，结合边界框IoU和重识别特征进行匹配。

Result: 在SportsMOT和DanceTrack等复杂基准测试中优于现有TBD方法，在MOT17等简单基准上达到竞争性性能。

Conclusion: 该方法首次使用自监督编码器优化分割掩码而不计算掩码IoU，在复杂场景中表现优异且计算效率高。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) methods often rely on Intersection-over-Union
(IoU) for association. However, this becomes unreliable when objects are
similar or occluded. Also, computing IoU for segmentation masks is
computationally expensive. In this work, we use segmentation masks to capture
object shapes, but we do not compute segmentation IoU. Instead, we fuse depth
and mask features and pass them through a compact encoder trained
self-supervised. This encoder produces stable object representations, which we
use as an additional similarity cue alongside bounding box IoU and
re-identification features for matching. We obtain depth maps from a zero-shot
depth estimator and object masks from a promptable visual segmentation model to
obtain fine-grained spatial cues. Our MOT method is the first to use the
self-supervised encoder to refine segmentation masks without computing masks
IoU. MOT can be divided into joint detection-ReID (JDR) and
tracking-by-detection (TBD) models. The latter are computationally more
efficient. Experiments of our TBD method on challenging benchmarks with
non-linear motion, occlusion, and crowded scenes, such as SportsMOT and
DanceTrack, show that our method outperforms the TBD state-of-the-art on most
metrics, while achieving competitive performance on simpler benchmarks with
linear motion, such as MOT17.

Conclusion: CHUG数据集将推动无参考HDR视频质量评估研究，通过提供大规模、多样化且真实世界的UGC数据集来解决现有研究的局限性。

Abstract: High Dynamic Range (HDR) videos enhance visual experiences with superior
brightness, contrast, and color depth. The surge of User-Generated Content
(UGC) on platforms like YouTube and TikTok introduces unique challenges for HDR
video quality assessment (VQA) due to diverse capture conditions, editing
artifacts, and compression distortions. Existing HDR-VQA datasets primarily
focus on professionally generated content (PGC), leaving a gap in understanding
real-world UGC-HDR degradations. To address this, we introduce CHUG:
Crowdsourced User-Generated HDR Video Quality Dataset, the first large-scale
subjective study on UGC-HDR quality. CHUG comprises 856 UGC-HDR source videos,
transcoded across multiple resolutions and bitrates to simulate real-world
scenarios, totaling 5,992 videos. A large-scale study via Amazon Mechanical
Turk collected 211,848 perceptual ratings. CHUG provides a benchmark for
analyzing UGC-specific distortions in HDR videos. We anticipate CHUG will
advance No-Reference (NR) HDR-VQA research by offering a large-scale, diverse,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 室内场景通常具有不规则布局、不同复杂度和遮挡，现有方法采用均匀基础排列效率低下。

Method: 在估计的几何支架上记录观测统计，指导基础的最优放置；提出场景自适应虚拟视点来补偿输入轨迹中的几何缺陷。

Result: 在多个大规模室内场景中，渲染质量和内存需求相比采用规则放置的基线方法有显著提升。

Conclusion: 场景自适应策略能有效利用有限资源，通过几何先验指导实现更好的室内场景重建效果。

Abstract: We propose scene-adaptive strategies to efficiently allocate representation
capacity for generating immersive experiences of indoor environments from
incomplete observations. Indoor scenes with multiple rooms often exhibit
irregular layouts with varying complexity, containing clutter, occlusion, and
flat walls. We maximize the utilization of limited resources with guidance from
geometric priors, which are often readily available after pre-processing
stages. We record observation statistics on the estimated geometric scaffold
and guide the optimal placement of bases, which greatly improves upon the
uniform basis arrangements adopted by previous scalable Neural Radiance Field
(NeRF) representations. We also suggest scene-adaptive virtual viewpoints to
compensate for geometric deficiencies inherent in view configurations in the
input trajectory and impose the necessary regularization. We present a
comprehensive analysis and discussion regarding rendering quality and memory
requirements in several large-scale indoor scenes, demonstrating significant
enhancements compared to baselines that employ regular placements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决日常环境中频繁场景变化带来的挑战，需要从稀疏、非结构化的捕捉中建模长期场景时序。

Method: 构建对象模板高斯作为结构先验，通过精炼管道基于少量观察调整先验以适应时序变化环境，支持跨时间步的通用变换。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上实验表明，相比基线方法获得更优的重建质量，同时实现快速轻量级更新。

Conclusion: LTGS框架能够有效处理长期场景变化，显著提升3D环境时序演化的可扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advances in novel-view synthesis can create the photo-realistic
visualization of real-world environments from conventional camera captures.
However, acquiring everyday environments from casual captures faces challenges
due to frequent scene changes, which require dense observations both spatially
and temporally. We propose long-term Gaussian scene chronology from sparse-view
updates, coined LTGS, an efficient scene representation that can embrace
everyday changes from highly under-constrained casual captures. Given an
incomplete and unstructured Gaussian splatting representation obtained from an
initial set of input images, we robustly model the long-term chronology of the
scene despite abrupt movements and subtle environmental variations. We
construct objects as template Gaussians, which serve as structural, reusable
priors for shared object tracks. Then, the object templates undergo a further
refinement pipeline that modulates the priors to adapt to temporally varying
environments based on few-shot observations. Once trained, our framework is
generalizable across multiple time steps through simple transformations,
significantly enhancing the scalability for a temporal evolution of 3D
environments. As existing datasets do not explicitly represent the long-term
real-world changes with a sparse capture setup, we collect real-world datasets
to evaluate the practicality of our pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to other baselines
while enabling fast and light-weight updates.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个多视角动物姿态估计框架，结合了多视角变换器、几何一致性增强、改进的集成卡尔曼平滑器和知识蒸馏技术，在有限标注数据下实现了准确且具有不确定性估计的姿态跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前多视角姿态估计方法在有限标注数据下准确性不足、不确定性估计差的问题，为动物行为科学研究提供可靠的姿态跟踪工具。

Method: 使用多视角变换器（MVT）同时处理所有视角信息，引入补丁掩码方案学习跨视角对应关系；对于标定设置，通过3D增强和三角化损失整合几何一致性；扩展非线性集成卡尔曼平滑器（EKS）并采用方差膨胀技术改进不确定性量化；设计知识蒸馏流程利用改进的EKS预测生成高质量伪标签。

Conclusion: 开发了一个实用、具有不确定性感知的可靠姿态估计系统，能够在真实世界数据约束下支持下游行为分析。

Abstract: Multi-view pose estimation is essential for quantifying animal behavior in
scientific research, yet current methods struggle to achieve accurate tracking
with limited labeled data and suffer from poor uncertainty estimates. We
address these challenges with a comprehensive framework combining novel
training and post-processing techniques, and a model distillation procedure
that leverages the strengths of these techniques to produce a more efficient
and effective pose estimator. Our multi-view transformer (MVT) utilizes
pretrained backbones and enables simultaneous processing of information across
all views, while a novel patch masking scheme learns robust cross-view
correspondences without camera calibration. For calibrated setups, we
incorporate geometric consistency through 3D augmentation and a triangulation
loss. We extend the existing Ensemble Kalman Smoother (EKS) post-processor to
the nonlinear case and enhance uncertainty quantification via a variance
inflation technique. Finally, to leverage the scaling properties of the MVT, we
design a distillation procedure that exploits improved EKS predictions and
uncertainty estimates to generate high-quality pseudo-labels, thereby reducing
dependence on manual labels. Our framework components consistently outperform
existing methods across three diverse animal species (flies, mice, chickadees),
with each component contributing complementary benefits. The result is a
practical, uncertainty-aware system for reliable pose estimation that enables
downstream behavioral analyses under real-world data constraints.

Abstract: The relevance of this research lies in the growing demand for unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) capable of operating reliably in complex environments where
conventional navigation becomes unreliable due to interference, poor
visibility, or camouflage. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides unique
opportunities for UAV-based computer vision by enabling fine-grained material
recognition and object differentiation, which are critical for navigation,
surveillance, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. The aim of this work
is to develop a deep learning architecture integrating HSI into UAV perception
for navigation, object detection, and terrain classification. Objectives
include: reviewing existing HSI methods, designing a hybrid 2D/3D convolutional
architecture with spectral-spatial cross-attention, training, and benchmarking.
The methodology is based on the modification of the Mobile 3D Vision
Transformer (MDvT) by introducing the proposed SpectralCA block. This block
employs bi-directional cross-attention to fuse spectral and spatial features,
enhancing accuracy while reducing parameters and inference time. Experimental
evaluation was conducted on the WHU-Hi-HongHu dataset, with results assessed
using Overall Accuracy, Average Accuracy, and the Kappa coefficient. The
findings confirm that the proposed architecture improves UAV perception
efficiency, enabling real-time operation for navigation, object recognition,
and environmental monitoring tasks.

TL;DR: 提出HeadsUp模型，这是一个单步扩散模型，专门用于解决肖像图像超分辨率问题，能够端到端地无缝恢复和放大肖像图像，避免传统混合方法产生的边界伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像超分辨率技术要么专注于通用真实世界图像，要么专注于严格对齐的人脸图像。在实际应用中，混合使用不同模型处理肖像照片会导致面部区域周围出现混合或边界伪影，而人类感知对面部保真度特别敏感。

Method: 基于单步扩散模型构建，开发了面部监督机制引导模型关注面部区域，并集成基于参考的机制帮助身份恢复，减少低质量面部恢复中的模糊性。同时构建了高质量的4K肖像图像超分辨率数据集PortraitSR-4K。

Conclusion: HeadsUp模型能够有效解决肖像图像超分辨率问题，通过端到端的方式无缝恢复和放大肖像图像，避免了传统混合方法带来的边界伪影问题。

Abstract: Portrait pictures, which typically feature both human subjects and natural
backgrounds, are one of the most prevalent forms of photography on social
media. Existing image super-resolution (ISR) techniques generally focus either
on generic real-world images or strictly aligned facial images (i.e., face
super-resolution). In practice, separate models are blended to handle portrait
photos: the face specialist model handles the face region, and the general
model processes the rest. However, these blending approaches inevitably
introduce blending or boundary artifacts around the facial regions due to
different model training recipes, while human perception is particularly
sensitive to facial fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we study the
portrait image supersolution (PortraitISR) problem, and propose HeadsUp, a
single-step diffusion model that is capable of seamlessly restoring and
upscaling portrait images in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we build our
model on top of a single-step diffusion model and develop a face supervision
mechanism to guide the model in focusing on the facial region. We then
integrate a reference-based mechanism to help with identity restoration,
reducing face ambiguity in low-quality face restoration. Additionally, we have
built a high-quality 4K portrait image ISR dataset dubbed PortraitSR-4K, to
support model training and benchmarking for portrait images. Extensive
experiments show that HeadsUp achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
PortraitISR task while maintaining comparable or higher performance on both
general image and aligned face datasets.

Motivation: 水下图像在海洋研究中至关重要，但复杂环境导致图像质量差（低可见度、模糊纹理、颜色失真、噪声）。现有图像增强方法泛化能力差且严重依赖高质量数据集，而当前数据集缺乏多样性且质量低，大多只有单目图像，限制了不同光照条件和角度的表示。

Conclusion: 通过去噪扩散模型扩展数据集多样性，结合Controlnet提升图像质量，可以有效克服现有水下图像增强方法的局限性，促进海洋生态系统研究的发展。

Abstract: Underwater images play a crucial role in ocean research and marine
environmental monitoring since they provide quality information about the
ecosystem. However, the complex and remote nature of the environment results in
poor image quality with issues such as low visibility, blurry textures, color
distortion, and noise. In recent years, research in image enhancement has
proven to be effective but also presents its own limitations, like poor
generalization and heavy reliance on clean datasets. One of the challenges
herein is the lack of diversity and the low quality of images included in these
datasets. Also, most existing datasets consist only of monocular images, a fact
that limits the representation of different lighting conditions and angles. In
this paper, we propose a new plan of action to overcome these limitations. On
one hand, we call for expanding the datasets using a denoising diffusion model
to include a variety of image types such as stereo, wide-angled, macro, and
close-up images. On the other hand, we recommend enhancing the images using
Controlnet to evaluate and increase the quality of the corresponding datasets,
and hence improve the study of the marine ecosystem.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于隐式神经表示（INR）的新方法，用于从纵向MRI数据中建模脑部衰老轨迹，通过将离散的神经影像数据表示为连续函数来解决传统深度学习方法在处理不规则采样数据时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类大脑在整个生命周期中经历动态的结构变化，纵向MRI数据对于表征典型和非典型衰老轨迹很有价值。但由于数据在个体内和群体间存在不同的空间和时间采样模式，传统深度学习方法难以表示潜在的连续生物过程。

Method: 使用隐式神经表示（INR）将受试者特定的纵向T1加权MRI数据建模为连续函数，设计了能够部分解耦空间和时间轨迹参数的新型INR架构，并开发了直接在INR参数空间上操作的分类框架。

Result: 在更现实的不规则采样实验中，基于INR的方法在脑衰老轨迹分类任务中达到81.3%的准确率，优于标准深度学习基线模型（73.7%）。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理纵向神经影像数据的不规则采样问题，为脑衰老轨迹分析提供了新的连续表示框架。

Abstract: The human brain undergoes dynamic, potentially pathology-driven, structural
changes throughout a lifespan. Longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
and other neuroimaging data are valuable for characterizing trajectories of
change associated with typical and atypical aging. However, the analysis of
such data is highly challenging given their discrete nature with different
spatial and temporal image sampling patterns within individuals and across
populations. This leads to computational problems for most traditional deep
learning methods that cannot represent the underlying continuous biological
process. To address these limitations, we present a new, fully data-driven
method for representing aging trajectories across the entire brain by modelling
subject-specific longitudinal T1-weighted MRI data as continuous functions
using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Therefore, we introduce a novel
INR architecture capable of partially disentangling spatial and temporal
trajectory parameters and design an efficient framework that directly operates
on the INRs' parameter space to classify brain aging trajectories. To evaluate
our method in a controlled data environment, we develop a biologically grounded
trajectory simulation and generate T1-weighted 3D MRI data for 450 healthy and
dementia-like subjects at regularly and irregularly sampled timepoints. In the
more realistic irregular sampling experiment, our INR-based method achieves
81.3% accuracy for the brain aging trajectory classification task,
outperforming a standard deep learning baseline model (73.7%).

Abstract: Segmentation models achieve high accuracy on benchmarks but often fail in
real-world domains by relying on spurious correlations instead of true object
boundaries. We propose a human-in-the-loop interactive framework that enables
interventional learning through targeted human corrections of segmentation
outputs. Our approach treats human corrections as interventional signals that
show when reliance on superficial features (e.g., color or texture) is
inappropriate. The system learns from these interventions by propagating
correction-informed edits across visually similar images, effectively steering
the model toward robust, semantically meaningful features rather than
dataset-specific artifacts. Unlike traditional annotation approaches that
simply provide more training data, our method explicitly identifies when and
why the model fails and then systematically corrects these failure modes across
the entire dataset. Through iterative human feedback, the system develops
increasingly robust representations that generalize better to novel domains and
resist artifactual correlations. We demonstrate that our framework improves
segmentation accuracy by up to 9 mIoU points (12-15\% relative improvement) on
challenging cubemap data and yields 3-4$\times$ reductions in annotation effort
compared to standard retraining, while maintaining competitive performance on
benchmark datasets. This work provides a practical framework for researchers
and practitioners seeking to build segmentation systems that are accurate,
robust to dataset biases, data-efficient, and adaptable to real-world domains
such as urban climate monitoring and autonomous driving.

Abstract: As a specialty agricultural product with a large market scale, Shatian pomelo
necessitates the adoption of automated detection to ensure accurate quantity
and meet commercial demands for lean production. Existing research often
involves specialized networks tailored for specific theoretical or dataset
scenarios, but these methods tend to degrade performance in real-world. Through
analysis of factors in this issue, this study identifies four key challenges
that affect the accuracy of Shatian pomelo detection: imaging devices, lighting
conditions, object scale variation, and occlusion. To mitigate these
challenges, a multi-strategy framework is proposed in this paper. Firstly, to
effectively solve tone variation introduced by diverse imaging devices and
complex orchard environments, we utilize a multi-scenario dataset,
STP-AgriData, which is constructed by integrating real orchard images with
internet-sourced data. Secondly, to simulate the inconsistent illumination
conditions, specific data augmentations such as adjusting contrast and changing
brightness, are applied to the above dataset. Thirdly, to address the issues of
object scale variation and occlusion in fruit detection, an REAS-Det network is
designed in this paper. For scale variation, RFAConv and C3RFEM modules are
designed to expand and enhance the receptive fields. For occlusion variation, a
multi-scale, multi-head feature selection structure (MultiSEAM) and soft-NMS
are introduced to enhance the handling of occlusion issues to improve detection
accuracy. The results of these experiments achieved a precision(P) of 87.6%, a
recall (R) of 74.9%, a mAP@.50 of 82.8%, and a mAP@.50:.95 of 53.3%. Our
proposed network demonstrates superior performance compared to other

TL;DR: J-RAS是一种联合训练方法，将分割模型与检索模型集成，通过检索图像-掩码对来增强分割性能，在多个数据集和架构上均取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像分割中标注数据稀缺、泛化能力差的问题，传统AI方法需要大量标注数据且难以应对患者间变异和罕见病例。

Method: 提出联合检索增强分割(J-RAS)，同时优化分割模型和检索模型，分割模型利用检索到的图像-掩码对增强解剖理解，检索模型学习超越视觉相似性的分割相关特征。

Result: 在ACDC和M&Ms数据集上验证，SegFormer结合J-RAS后Dice分数从0.8708提升到0.9115，Hausdorff距离从1.8130降低到1.1489，在U-Net、TransUNet、SAM等架构上均取得一致改进。

Conclusion: J-RAS方法有效提升了医学图像分割性能，具有良好的通用性和泛化能力，能够为分割提供有意义的上下文指导。

Abstract: Image segmentation, the process of dividing images into meaningful regions,
is critical in medical applications for accurate diagnosis, treatment planning,
and disease monitoring. Although manual segmentation by healthcare
professionals produces precise outcomes, it is time-consuming, costly, and
prone to variability due to differences in human expertise. Artificial
intelligence (AI)-based methods have been developed to address these
limitations by automating segmentation tasks; however, they often require
large, annotated datasets that are rarely available in practice and frequently
struggle to generalize across diverse imaging conditions due to inter-patient
variability and rare pathological cases. In this paper, we propose Joint
Retrieval Augmented Segmentation (J-RAS), a joint training method for guided
image segmentation that integrates a segmentation model with a retrieval model.
Both models are jointly optimized, enabling the segmentation model to leverage
retrieved image-mask pairs to enrich its anatomical understanding, while the
retrieval model learns segmentation-relevant features beyond simple visual
similarity. This joint optimization ensures that retrieval actively contributes
meaningful contextual cues to guide boundary delineation, thereby enhancing the
overall segmentation performance. We validate J-RAS across multiple
segmentation backbones, including U-Net, TransUNet, SAM, and SegFormer, on two
benchmark datasets: ACDC and M&Ms, demonstrating consistent improvements. For
example, on the ACDC dataset, SegFormer without J-RAS achieves a mean Dice
score of 0.8708$\pm$0.042 and a mean Hausdorff Distance (HD) of
1.8130$\pm$2.49, whereas with J-RAS, the performance improves substantially to
a mean Dice score of 0.9115$\pm$0.031 and a mean HD of 1.1489$\pm$0.30. These
results highlight the method's effectiveness and its generalizability across
architectures and datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于AI的端到端交通监控框架，利用现有交通摄像头进行大规模高分辨率分析，通过YOLOv11模型实时提取交通密度和分类指标，使用图基视角归一化处理动态摄像头问题，集成领域特定大语言模型自动生成交通模式摘要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统交通传感器部署成本高，现有视频分析技术难以处理大规模摄像头网络的动态视角和海量数据，需要一种准确、可扩展的交通监控解决方案来支持实时和长期交通管理。

Method: 使用微调YOLOv11模型进行实时交通密度和分类提取；提出图基视角归一化方法处理非固定PTZ摄像头的不一致性；集成领域特定LLM处理24/7视频流数据生成自动化摘要。

Result: 在纽约市拥堵收费政策早期实施期间验证，工作日客运车辆密度在拥堵缓解区内下降9%，卡车流量早期减少但有反弹迹象，行人和自行车活动在走廊和区域尺度上持续增加。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了作为实用、基础设施就绪的大规模交通监控解决方案的潜力，能够以最少的人工干预进行政策相关的交通监测。

Abstract: Accurate, scalable traffic monitoring is critical for real-time and long-term
transportation management, particularly during disruptions such as natural
disasters, large construction projects, or major policy changes like New York
City's first-in-the-nation congestion pricing program. However, widespread
sensor deployment remains limited due to high installation, maintenance, and
data management costs. While traffic cameras offer a cost-effective
alternative, existing video analytics struggle with dynamic camera viewpoints
and massive data volumes from large camera networks. This study presents an
end-to-end AI-based framework leveraging existing traffic camera infrastructure
for high-resolution, longitudinal analysis at scale. A fine-tuned YOLOv11
model, trained on localized urban scenes, extracts multimodal traffic density
and classification metrics in real time. To address inconsistencies from
non-stationary pan-tilt-zoom cameras, we introduce a novel graph-based
viewpoint normalization method. A domain-specific large language model was also
integrated to process massive data from a 24/7 video stream to generate
frequent, automated summaries of evolving traffic patterns, a task far
exceeding manual capabilities. We validated the system using over 9 million
images from roughly 1,000 traffic cameras during the early rollout of NYC
congestion pricing in 2025. Results show a 9% decline in weekday passenger
vehicle density within the Congestion Relief Zone, early truck volume
reductions with signs of rebound, and consistent increases in pedestrian and
cyclist activity at corridor and zonal scales. Experiments showed that
example-based prompts improved LLM's numerical accuracy and reduced
hallucinations. These findings demonstrate the framework's potential as a
practical, infrastructure-ready solution for large-scale, policy-relevant
traffic monitoring with minimal human intervention.

*Lishen Qu,Zhihao Liu,Jinshan Pan,Shihao Zhou,Jinglei Shi,Duosheng Chen,Jufeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FlareX数据集，通过物理信息方法生成镜头光晕数据，包含2D和3D合成方法，解决现有数据缺乏多样性和物理真实性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有镜头光晕数据集通常通过2D合成方法生成，缺乏光晕多样性且忽略物理原理，导致模型在真实场景中泛化能力差。

Method: 采用三阶段物理信息方法：参数化模板创建、光照定律感知的2D合成、基于物理引擎的3D渲染，生成混合2D和3D视角的FlareX数据集。

Result: 生成包含9,500个2D模板（来自95种光晕模式）和3,000个光晕图像对（来自60个3D场景）的数据集，并通过掩码方法获得真实世界无光晕图像用于评估。

Conclusion: 实验证明该方法及数据集的有效性，能显著提升模型在真实场景中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Lens flare occurs when shooting towards strong light sources, significantly
degrading the visual quality of images. Due to the difficulty in capturing
flare-corrupted and flare-free image pairs in the real world, existing datasets
are typically synthesized in 2D by overlaying artificial flare templates onto
background images. However, the lack of flare diversity in templates and the
neglect of physical principles in the synthesis process hinder models trained
on these datasets from generalizing well to real-world scenarios. To address
these challenges, we propose a new physics-informed method for flare data
generation, which consists of three stages: parameterized template creation,
the laws of illumination-aware 2D synthesis, and physical engine-based 3D
rendering, which finally gives us a mixed flare dataset that incorporates both
2D and 3D perspectives, namely FlareX. This dataset offers 9,500 2D templates
derived from 95 flare patterns and 3,000 flare image pairs rendered from 60 3D
scenes. Furthermore, we design a masking approach to obtain real-world
flare-free images from their corrupted counterparts to measure the performance
of the model on real-world images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method and dataset.

*Lishen Qu,Zhihao Liu,Shihao Zhou,Yaqi Luo,Jie Liang,Hui Zeng,Lei Zhang,Jufeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了BurstDeflicker基准数据集，通过三种互补的数据采集策略来解决闪烁伪影去除研究中缺乏大规模真实数据集的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 滚动快门相机与交流电照明之间的相互作用导致短曝光图像中出现闪烁伪影，表现为不均匀的亮度分布和暗带。这些伪影不仅影响图像质量，还影响物体检测和跟踪等高级任务。当前缺乏大规模真实数据集是闪烁去除研究的主要障碍。

Method: 1. 开发基于Retinex的合成管道，可控制操纵关键闪烁属性；2. 从不同场景捕获4000张真实闪烁图像；3. 提出绿幕方法在保持真实闪烁退化的同时将运动纳入图像对。

Result: 构建了可扩展的BurstDeflicker基准，包含合成数据、真实采集数据和动态场景数据，全面覆盖闪烁伪影的各种特征。

Conclusion: 综合实验证明了该数据集的有效性及其在推动闪烁去除研究方面的潜力。

Abstract: Flicker artifacts in short-exposure images are caused by the interplay
between the row-wise exposure mechanism of rolling shutter cameras and the
temporal intensity variations of alternating current (AC)-powered lighting.
These artifacts typically appear as uneven brightness distribution across the
image, forming noticeable dark bands. Beyond compromising image quality, this
structured noise also affects high-level tasks, such as object detection and
tracking, where reliable lighting is crucial. Despite the prevalence of
flicker, the lack of a large-scale, realistic dataset has been a significant
barrier to advancing research in flicker removal. To address this issue, we
present BurstDeflicker, a scalable benchmark constructed using three
complementary data acquisition strategies. First, we develop a Retinex-based
synthesis pipeline that redefines the goal of flicker removal and enables
controllable manipulation of key flicker-related attributes (e.g., intensity,
area, and frequency), thereby facilitating the generation of diverse flicker
patterns. Second, we capture 4,000 real-world flicker images from different
scenes, which help the model better understand the spatial and temporal
characteristics of real flicker artifacts and generalize more effectively to
wild scenarios. Finally, due to the non-repeatable nature of dynamic scenes, we
propose a green-screen method to incorporate motion into image pairs while
preserving real flicker degradation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our dataset and its potential to advance research in flicker
removal.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIMO是一个统一的医疗视觉语言模型，具有视觉参考的多模态输入和像素定位的多模态输出能力，解决了现有模型缺乏对图像视觉线索直接理解和输出与图像关键区域连接的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗视觉语言模型存在两个问题：输入端仅依赖文本指令而缺乏对图像视觉线索的直接理解；输出端仅给出文本答案而缺乏与图像关键区域的连接。

Method: 提出MIMO模型，结合视觉参考的多模态输入和像素定位的多模态输出。构建了包含89.5万样本的MIMOSeg数据集，从四个不同角度覆盖基础指令遵循和复杂问答任务。

Result: 在多个下游医疗多模态任务上的实验结果表明，MIMO能够独特地结合视觉参考和像素定位能力，这是先前模型所不具备的。

Conclusion: MIMO模型成功解决了医疗视觉语言模型在输入和输出方面的局限性，通过多模态输入输出实现了对复杂医疗图像和语义的更好理解与表达。

Abstract: Currently, medical vision language models are widely used in medical vision
question answering tasks. However, existing models are confronted with two
issues: for input, the model only relies on text instructions and lacks direct
understanding of visual clues in the image; for output, the model only gives
text answers and lacks connection with key areas in the image. To address these
issues, we propose a unified medical vision language model MIMO, with visual
referring Multimodal Input and pixel grounding Multimodal Output. MIMO can not
only combine visual clues and textual instructions to understand complex
medical images and semantics, but can also ground medical terminologies in
textual output within the image. To overcome the scarcity of relevant data in
the medical field, we propose MIMOSeg, a comprehensive medical multimodal
dataset including 895K samples. MIMOSeg is constructed from four different
perspectives, covering basic instruction following and complex question
answering with multimodal input and multimodal output. We conduct experiments
on several downstream medical multimodal tasks. Extensive experimental results
verify that MIMO can uniquely combine visual referring and pixel grounding
capabilities, which are not available in previous models.

*Junan Chen,Trung Thanh Nguyen,Takahiro Komamizu,Ichiro Ide*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Query-Adapter(Q-Adapter)轻量级视觉适配器模块，通过引入可学习查询令牌和门控层来增强多模态大语言模型，实现视频字幕任务的高效微调，在参数效率与性能间取得良好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法主要关注语言组件，在多模态任务中探索不足且缺乏对视觉信息的充分理解。随着模型规模增大，全模型微调变得计算昂贵，需要更高效的替代方案。

Method: Q-Adapter在视觉编码器中引入可学习查询令牌和门控层，无需外部文本监督即可有效提取稀疏的、与字幕相关的特征。

Result: 在MSR-VTT和MSVD数据集上，Q-Adapter在PEFT方法中达到最先进性能，在BLEU@4、METEOR、ROUGE-L和CIDEr指标上表现优异，仅需1.4%参数即可与全微调方法竞争。

Conclusion: Q-Adapter在平衡字幕质量和参数效率方面展现出强大潜力，证明了其在视频语言建模中的可扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advances in video captioning are driven by large-scale pretrained
models, which follow the standard "pre-training followed by fine-tuning"
paradigm, where the full model is fine-tuned for downstream tasks. Although
effective, this approach becomes computationally prohibitive as the model size
increases. The Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approach offers a
promising alternative, but primarily focuses on the language components of
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Despite recent progress, PEFT remains
underexplored in multimodal tasks and lacks sufficient understanding of visual
information during fine-tuning the model. To bridge this gap, we propose
Query-Adapter (Q-Adapter), a lightweight visual adapter module designed to
enhance MLLMs by enabling efficient fine-tuning for the video captioning task.
Q-Adapter introduces learnable query tokens and a gating layer into Vision
Encoder, enabling effective extraction of sparse, caption-relevant features
without relying on external textual supervision. We evaluate Q-Adapter on two
well-known video captioning datasets, MSR-VTT and MSVD, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance among the methods that take the PEFT approach
across BLEU@4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr metrics. Q-Adapter also achieves
competitive performance compared to methods that take the full fine-tuning
approach while requiring only 1.4% of the parameters. We further analyze the
impact of key hyperparameters and design choices on fine-tuning effectiveness,
providing insights into optimization strategies for adapter-based learning.
These results highlight the strong potential of Q-Adapter in balancing caption
quality and parameter efficiency, demonstrating its scalability for
video-language modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: P-4DGS是一种用于动态3D场景建模的紧凑4D高斯泼溅表示方法，通过时空预测和压缩技术显著减少内存消耗，在保持高质量重建的同时实现高达90倍的压缩比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的动态3D高斯泼溅算法忽略了动态场景中固有的时空冗余，导致内存消耗过高，需要一种更紧凑的表示方法。

Method: 设计基于3D锚点的时空预测模块来利用3D高斯基元间的时空相关性，结合自适应量化和基于上下文的熵编码进一步压缩3D锚点。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上的实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的重建质量和最快的渲染速度，平均存储占用仅约1MB，在合成和真实场景上分别达到40倍和90倍的压缩比。

Conclusion: P-4DGS通过有效的时空预测和压缩策略，成功解决了动态3D高斯泼溅表示中的内存消耗问题，在保持高质量重建的同时显著降低了存储需求。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered significant attention due to its
superior scene representation fidelity and real-time rendering performance,
especially for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction (\textit{i.e.}, 4D
reconstruction). However, despite achieving promising results, most existing
algorithms overlook the substantial temporal and spatial redundancies inherent
in dynamic scenes, leading to prohibitive memory consumption. To address this,
we propose P-4DGS, a novel dynamic 3DGS representation for compact 4D scene
modeling. Inspired by intra- and inter-frame prediction techniques commonly
used in video compression, we first design a 3D anchor point-based
spatial-temporal prediction module to fully exploit the spatial-temporal
correlations across different 3D Gaussian primitives. Subsequently, we employ
an adaptive quantization strategy combined with context-based entropy coding to
further reduce the size of the 3D anchor points, thereby achieving enhanced
compression efficiency. To evaluate the rate-distortion performance of our
proposed P-4DGS in comparison with other dynamic 3DGS representations, we
conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
reconstruction quality and the fastest rendering speed, with a remarkably low
storage footprint (around \textbf{1MB} on average), achieving up to
\textbf{40$\times$} and \textbf{90$\times$} compression on synthetic and
real-world scenes, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CCFormer框架，通过早期集成模块、多查询Transformer模块和双模态对比学习，有效处理音频-视觉分割任务，在多个数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN方法受限于局部感受野，Transformer方法难以充分提取多模态系数和时序动态。需要新的框架来全面处理局部和全局信息，捕捉时空上下文。

Method: CCFormer包含三个核心模块：早期集成模块（并行双边架构融合多尺度视觉特征和音频数据）、多查询Transformer模块（动态赋予音频查询学习能力，同时建模帧级和视频级关系）、双模态对比学习（在统一特征空间中促进跨模态对齐）。

Result: 在S4、MS3和AVSS数据集上均达到了新的最先进性能基准。

Conclusion: CCFormer通过有效结合局部和全局信息处理、时空上下文捕捉以及跨模态对齐，显著提升了音频-视觉分割的性能。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to generate pixel-wise segmentation maps
that correlate with the auditory signals of objects. This field has seen
significant progress with numerous CNN and Transformer-based methods enhancing
the segmentation accuracy and robustness. Traditional CNN approaches manage
audio-visual interactions through basic operations like padding and
multiplications but are restricted by CNNs' limited local receptive field. More
recently, Transformer-based methods treat auditory cues as queries, utilizing
attention mechanisms to enhance audio-visual cooperation within frames.
Nevertheless, they typically struggle to extract multimodal coefficients and
temporal dynamics adequately. To overcome these limitations, we present the
Complementary and Contrastive Transformer (CCFormer), a novel framework adept
at processing both local and global information and capturing spatial-temporal
context comprehensively. Our CCFormer initiates with the Early Integration
Module (EIM) that employs a parallel bilateral architecture, merging
multi-scale visual features with audio data to boost cross-modal
complementarity. To extract the intra-frame spatial features and facilitate the
perception of temporal coherence, we introduce the Multi-query Transformer
Module (MTM), which dynamically endows audio queries with learning capabilities
and models the frame and video-level relations simultaneously. Furthermore, we
propose the Bi-modal Contrastive Learning (BCL) to promote the alignment across
both modalities in the unified feature space. Through the effective combination
of those designs, our method sets new state-of-the-art benchmarks across the
S4, MS3 and AVSS datasets. Our source code and model weights will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/SitongGong/CCFormer

TL;DR: ViTAR是一个医学视觉语言模型框架，通过"思考-行动-再思考-回答"的认知链模拟人类专家的迭代推理过程，在医学图像诊断中实现多步骤视觉推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学视觉语言模型通常依赖单次推理，忽略了局部视觉线索，而人类专家在临床实践中会迭代扫描、聚焦和细化感兴趣区域。ViTAR旨在缩小这种机器与人类感知差距。

Method: 提出ViTAR框架，将医学图像视为交互对象，支持多步骤视觉推理。构建了包含1K交互示例的高质量指令数据集和16K视觉问答训练数据。采用两阶段训练策略：监督微调引导认知轨迹，强化学习优化决策。

Result: 广泛评估表明ViTAR优于现有最先进模型。视觉注意力分析显示，从"思考"到"再思考"阶段，ViTAR逐渐将视觉基础锚定到临床关键区域，并在推理过程中保持对视觉标记的高注意力分配。

Conclusion: 将专家风格的迭代思维链嵌入视觉语言模型可以增强医学AI的性能和可信度。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image-text understanding but
typically rely on a single-pass reasoning that neglects localized visual cues.
In clinical practice, however, human experts iteratively scan, focus, and
refine the regions of interest before reaching a final diagnosis. To narrow
this machine-human perception gap, we introduce ViTAR, a novel VLM framework
that emulates the iterative reasoning process of human experts through a
cognitive chain of "think-act-rethink-answer". ViTAR treats medical images as
interactive objects, enabling models to engage multi-step visual reasoning. To
support this approach, we curate a high-quality instruction dataset comprising
1K interactive examples that encode expert-like diagnostic behaviors. In
addition, a 16K visual question answering training data has been curated
towards fine-grained visual diagnosis. We introduce a two-stage training
strategy that begins with supervised fine-tuning to guide cognitive
trajectories, followed by the reinforcement learning to optimize
decision-making. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ViTAR outperforms
strong state-of-the-art models. Visual attention analysis reveals that from the
"think" to "rethink" rounds, ViTAR increasingly anchors visual grounding to
clinically critical regions and maintains high attention allocation to visual
tokens during reasoning, providing mechanistic insight into its improved
performance. These findings demonstrate that embedding expert-style iterative
thinking chains into VLMs enhances both performance and trustworthiness of
medical AI.

Conclusion: DREAM基准为深度伪造视觉真实性评估及相关领域的研究提供了重要基础，有助于评估深度伪造的质量和欺骗性，并可能改进深度伪造生成过程。

Abstract: Deep learning based face-swap videos, widely known as deepfakes, have drawn
wide attention due to their threat to information credibility. Recent works
mainly focus on the problem of deepfake detection that aims to reliably tell
deepfakes apart from real ones, in an objective way. On the other hand, the
subjective perception of deepfakes, especially its computational modeling and
imitation, is also a significant problem but lacks adequate study. In this
paper, we focus on the visual realism assessment of deepfakes, which is defined
as the automatic assessment of deepfake visual realism that approximates human
perception of deepfakes. It is important for evaluating the quality and
deceptiveness of deepfakes which can be used for predicting the influence of
deepfakes on Internet, and it also has potentials in improving the deepfake
generation process by serving as a critic. This paper prompts this new
direction by presenting a comprehensive benchmark called DREAM, which stands
for Deepfake REalism AssessMent. It is comprised of a deepfake video dataset of
diverse quality, a large scale annotation that includes 140,000 realism scores
and textual descriptions obtained from 3,500 human annotators, and a
comprehensive evaluation and analysis of 16 representative realism assessment
methods, including recent large vision language model based methods and a newly
proposed description-aligned CLIP method. The benchmark and insights included
in this study can lay the foundation for future research in this direction and
other related areas.

Conclusion: CLSL方法通过协同学习语义感知特征和标签恢复，形成了一个相互增强的循环，有效解决了标签不完整情况下的多标签图像识别问题。

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels is a critical learning
task and has emerged as a focal topic in computer vision. However, this task is
confronted with two core challenges: semantic-aware feature learning and
missing label recovery. In this paper, we propose a novel Collaborative
Learning of Semantic-aware feature learning and Label recovery (CLSL) method
for multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels, which unifies the two
aforementioned challenges into a unified learning framework. More specifically,
we design a semantic-related feature learning module to learn robust
semantic-related features by discovering semantic information and label
correlations. Then, a semantic-guided feature enhancement module is proposed to
generate high-quality discriminative semantic-aware features by effectively
aligning visual and semantic feature spaces. Finally, we introduce a
collaborative learning framework that integrates semantic-aware feature
learning and label recovery, which can not only dynamically enhance the
discriminability of semantic-aware features but also adaptively infer and
recover missing labels, forming a mutually reinforced loop between the two
processes. Extensive experiments on three widely used public datasets (MS-COCO,
VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE) demonstrate that CLSL outperforms the state-of-the-art
multi-label image recognition methods with incomplete labels.

Motivation: 解决自监督预训练方法在计算机视觉多模态任务中的应用，特别是针对无人机场景中多世界解释和多模态数据的需求。

Method: 使用概率超图结合掩码自编码器，随机掩码整个模态而非仅图像块，在单次训练循环中同时完成预训练和微调，支持推理时集成和知识蒸馏。

Result: 模型能够创建推理时集成，通过聚合提升预测性能和一致性，并可在少于100万参数的模型上进行知识蒸馏而性能损失很小。

Conclusion: PHG-MAE为多模态多任务学习提供了统一框架，特别适用于无人机场景，并可扩展到自动驾驶和室内机器人等领域。

Abstract: The computer vision domain has greatly benefited from an abundance of data
across many modalities to improve on various visual tasks. Recently, there has
been a lot of focus on self-supervised pre-training methods through Masked
Autoencoders (MAE) \cite{he2022masked,bachmann2022multimae}, usually used as a
first step before optimizing for a downstream task, such as classification or
regression. This is very useful as it doesn't require any manually labeled
data. In this work, we introduce Probabilistic Hyper-Graphs using Masked
Autoencoders (PHG-MAE): a novel model that unifies the classical work on neural
graphs \cite{leordeanu2021semi} with the modern approach of masked autoencoders
under a common theoretical framework. Through random masking of entire
modalities, not just patches, the model samples from the distribution of
hyper-edges on each forward pass. Additionally, the model adapts the standard
MAE algorithm by combining pre-training and fine-tuning into a single training
loop. Moreover, our approach enables the creation of inference-time ensembles
which, through aggregation, boost the final prediction performance and
consistency. Lastly, we show that we can apply knowledge distillation on top of
the ensembles with little loss in performance, even with models that have fewer
than 1M parameters. While our work mostly focuses on outdoor UAV scenes that
contain multiple world interpretations and modalities, the same steps can be
followed in other similar domains, such as autonomous driving or indoor
robotics. In order to streamline the process of integrating external

scenarios, we developed a data-pipeline software. Using this tool, we have
created and released a fully-automated extension of the Dronescapes dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉基础模型的通用框架，用于追踪大型滑坡疤痕的时空演化，通过将离散遥感图像重构为连续视频序列来实现连续监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars is
critical for understanding the evolution mechanisms and failure precursors,
enabling effective early-warning. However, most existing studies have focused
on single-phase or pre- and post-failure dual-phase landslide identification.
Although these approaches delineate post-failure landslide boundaries, it is
challenging to track the spatiotemporal evolution of landslide scars. To
address this problem, this study proposes a novel and universal framework for
tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars using a
vision foundation model. The key idea behind the proposed framework is to
reconstruct discrete optical remote sensing images into a continuous video
sequence. This transformation enables a vision foundation model, which is
developed for video segmentation, to be used for tracking the evolution of
landslide scars. The proposed framework operates within a knowledge-guided,
auto-propagation, and interactive refinement paradigm to ensure the continuous
and accurate identification of landslide scars. The proposed framework was
validated through application to two representative cases: the post-failure
Baige landslide and the active Sela landslide (2017-2025). Results indicate
that the proposed framework enables continuous tracking of landslide scars,
capturing both failure precursors critical for early warning and post-failure
evolution essential for assessing secondary hazards and long-term stability.

*Jiahui Lu,Haihong Xiao,Xueyan Zhao,Wenxiong Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gesplat是一个基于3D高斯泼溅的框架，能够在无姿态稀疏图像下实现鲁棒的新视角合成和几何一致重建，通过VGGT基础模型获取初始姿态和密集点云，结合混合高斯表示、图引导属性优化和基于流的光度正则化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF和3DGS严重依赖准确的相机姿态和密集视角覆盖，限制了在稀疏视角设置下的应用，因为姿态估计不可靠且监督不足。

Method: 1) 使用VGGT基础模型获取初始姿态和密集点云；2) 混合高斯表示与双位置-形状优化；3) 图引导属性优化模块；4) 基于流的光度正则化。

Result: 在正向视角和大规模复杂数据集上相比其他无姿态方法实现了更鲁棒的性能。

Conclusion: Gesplat框架有效解决了稀疏视角下3D重建和新视角合成的挑战，通过结合基础模型和多种优化策略实现了几何一致的重建效果。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have advanced
3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, but remain heavily dependent on
accurate camera poses and dense viewpoint coverage. These requirements limit
their applicability in sparse-view settings, where pose estimation becomes
unreliable and supervision is insufficient. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce Gesplat, a 3DGS-based framework that enables robust novel view
synthesis and geometrically consistent reconstruction from unposed sparse
images. Unlike prior works that rely on COLMAP for sparse point cloud
initialization, we leverage the VGGT foundation model to obtain more reliable
initial poses and dense point clouds. Our approach integrates several key
innovations: 1) a hybrid Gaussian representation with dual position-shape
optimization enhanced by inter-view matching consistency; 2) a graph-guided
attribute refinement module to enhance scene details; and 3) flow-based depth
regularization that improves depth estimation accuracy for more effective
supervision. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves more robust performance on both forward-facing and
large-scale complex datasets compared to other pose-free methods.

*Kuangpu Guo,Lijun Sheng,Yongcan Yu,Jian Liang,Zilei Wang,Ran He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 首次将无监督联邦学习扩展到分类问题，提出FedCoPL方法，利用CLIP模型通过伪标签分布估计和调整来解决类别不平衡问题，并采用部分提示聚合协议实现有效协作和个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无监督联邦学习主要关注表示学习和聚类任务，而随着视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在零样本预测方面的强大能力，分类问题在无监督联邦学习框架下变得可行但尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出FedCoPL方法：客户端估计并上传伪标签分布，服务器调整并重新分发以避免全局类别不平衡；引入部分提示聚合协议，视觉提示在服务器聚合，文本提示在本地保留以实现个性化。

Result: 大量实验表明FedCoPL相比基线方法具有优越性能。

Conclusion: 成功将无监督联邦学习扩展到分类问题，FedCoPL方法通过伪标签分布调整和部分提示聚合有效解决了类别不平衡问题，实现了良好的协作和个性化效果。

Abstract: Unsupervised Federated Learning (UFL) aims to collaboratively train a global
model across distributed clients without sharing data or accessing label
information. Previous UFL works have predominantly focused on representation
learning and clustering tasks. Recently, vision language models (e.g., CLIP)
have gained significant attention for their powerful zero-shot prediction
capabilities. Leveraging this advancement, classification problems that were
previously infeasible under the UFL paradigm now present promising new
opportunities, yet remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we extend UFL to
the classification problem with CLIP for the first time and propose a novel
method, \underline{\textbf{Fed}}erated \underline{\textbf{Co}}operative
\underline{\textbf{P}}seudo \underline{\textbf{L}}abeling (\textbf{FedCoPL}).
Specifically, clients estimate and upload their pseudo label distribution, and
the server adjusts and redistributes them to avoid global imbalance among
classes. Moreover, we introduce a partial prompt aggregation protocol for
effective collaboration and personalization. In particular, visual prompts
containing general image features are aggregated at the server, while text
prompts encoding personalized knowledge are retained locally. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FedCoPL compared to
baseline methods. Our code is available at

*Minbin Huang,Runhui Huang,Chuanyang Zheng,Jingyao Li,Guoxuan Chen,Han Shi,Hong Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ACRE方法，通过一致性检查改进GRPO算法，解决强化学习中推理链与最终答案不一致的问题，在视频推理和数学推理任务上分别提升2.2%和1.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于可验证奖励的强化学习虽然能提高答案准确性，但会导致推理过程与最终答案不一致的问题，在MMVU数据集上标准GRPO方法只有79.7%的一致性。

Method: ACRE方法修改GRPO算法，增加辅助一致性检查：在模型生成推理链和初始答案后，打乱答案选项并基于相同推理过程预测第二个答案，设计一致性验证奖励机制。

Result: 在视频推理和数学推理基准测试中，ACRE相比GRPO基线分别平均提升2.2%和1.5%。

Conclusion: ACRE通过一致性验证奖励有效解决了推理-答案不匹配问题，减少了模型对虚假模式（如选项顺序偏差）的依赖。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can significantly enhance
reasoning abilities by directly optimizing correctness, rather than relying
solely on supervised imitation. This paradigm has been extended to multimodal
LLMs for complex video and image understanding tasks. However, while
outcome-driven RL improves answer accuracy, it can inadvertently decouple the
reasoning chain from the final answer, leading to situations where models
produce inconsistency between the reasoning trace and final answer. In our
experiments on multiple-choice visual question-answering tasks, the standard
GRPO method yields only 79.7\% consistency on MMVU between the reasoning steps
and the chosen answers, indicating frequent mismatches between answers and
reasoning. To this end, we propose Answer-Consistent Reinforcement Learning
(ACRE) that modifies the GRPO algorithm with an auxiliary consistency check.
After the model generates a chain of thought and an initial answer for a given
question, we shuffle the answer options and prompt the model again with the
same reasoning trace to predict a second answer. We design a
consistency-verification reward that grants a high reward only if both the
original and the post-shuffle answers agree and are correct; otherwise, a lower
reward is assigned accordingly. This mechanism penalizes reasoning-answer
misalignment and discourages the model from relying on spurious patterns, such
as option ordering biases. We evaluate ACRE on challenging Video Reasoning
benchmarks and multimodal math reasoning benchmarks, achieving an average 2.2\%
and 1.5\% improvement for Video Reasoning and Math Reasoning tasks over the
GRPO baseline.

*Aniruddha Srinivas Joshi,Godwyn James William,Shreyas Srinivas Joshi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种不确定性感知的后检测框架，通过统计不确定性和视觉特征重新调整检测置信度，提升紧凑型深度学习模型在火灾烟雾检测中的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉的火灾烟雾检测方法在效率和可靠性之间难以平衡，紧凑型模型如YOLOv5n/YOLOv8n在部署时容易出现误报和漏检，传统后处理方法仅依赖空间重叠，在复杂场景中效果有限。

Method: 提出轻量级置信度精炼网络，整合不确定性估计与颜色、边缘、纹理等视觉特征来调整检测分数，无需修改基础模型。

Result: 在D-Fire数据集上的实验显示，相比现有基线方法，精度、召回率和平均精度均有提升，且计算开销适中。

Conclusion: 后检测重评分能有效增强紧凑型深度学习模型在真实世界火灾烟雾检测中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate fire and smoke detection is critical for safety and disaster
response, yet existing vision-based methods face challenges in balancing
efficiency and reliability. Compact deep learning models such as YOLOv5n and
YOLOv8n are widely adopted for deployment on UAVs, CCTV systems, and IoT
devices, but their reduced capacity often results in false positives and missed
detections. Conventional post-detection methods such as Non-Maximum Suppression
and Soft-NMS rely only on spatial overlap, which can suppress true positives or
retain false alarms in cluttered or ambiguous fire scenes. To address these
limitations, we propose an uncertainty aware post-detection framework that
rescales detection confidences using both statistical uncertainty and domain
relevant visual cues. A lightweight Confidence Refinement Network integrates
uncertainty estimates with color, edge, and texture features to adjust
detection scores without modifying the base model. Experiments on the D-Fire
dataset demonstrate improved precision, recall, and mean average precision
compared to existing baselines, with only modest computational overhead. These
results highlight the effectiveness of post-detection rescoring in enhancing
the robustness of compact deep learning models for real-world fire and smoke
detection.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的ICFC框架，利用多模态大语言模型进行可解释的图像篡改定位，在多个基准测试中超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像篡改技术发展带来安全威胁，需要有效的篡改定位方法。现有监督方法依赖昂贵标注，弱监督或无训练方法性能不足且缺乏可解释性。

Method: ICFC框架结合对象化规则构建和自适应过滤建立可靠知识库，采用多步渐进推理流程，从粗粒度建议到细粒度取证结果，模拟专家取证工作流。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，ICFC不仅超越了最先进的无训练方法，还达到与弱监督和全监督方法相当或更优的性能。

Conclusion: ICFC框架成功利用MLLM推理能力，实现了图像级分类、像素级定位和文本级可解释性的系统开发，为图像取证提供了有效的无训练解决方案。

Abstract: Advances in image tampering pose serious security threats, underscoring the
need for effective image manipulation localization (IML). While supervised IML
achieves strong performance, it depends on costly pixel-level annotations.
Existing weakly supervised or training-free alternatives often underperform and
lack interpretability. We propose the In-Context Forensic Chain (ICFC), a
training-free framework that leverages multi-modal large language models
(MLLMs) for interpretable IML tasks. ICFC integrates an objectified rule
construction with adaptive filtering to build a reliable knowledge base and a
multi-step progressive reasoning pipeline that mirrors expert forensic
workflows from coarse proposals to fine-grained forensics results. This design
enables systematic exploitation of MLLM reasoning for image-level
classification, pixel-level localization, and text-level interpretability.
Across multiple benchmarks, ICFC not only surpasses state-of-the-art
training-free methods but also achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to weakly and fully supervised approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了ImmerIris数据集，这是目前最大的公开VR头显采集的离轴虹膜数据集，包含564个对象的499,791张眼部图像。针对传统虹膜识别方法在沉浸式场景中表现不佳的问题，作者提出了无需归一化的新范式，直接学习眼部图像，显著提升了识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在增强现实和虚拟现实等自我中心应用中，沉浸式虹膜识别正成为一种准确且无缝的身份识别方式。然而，传统系统在受控环境下通过专用正面传感器获取虹膜图像，而沉浸式设置主要通过倾斜放置的头显摄像头在开放场景中捕获离轴虹膜，这带来了透视畸变、质量退化加剧和虹膜纹理类内变化等独特挑战。目前缺乏专门针对这些挑战的数据集。

Method: 1) 构建ImmerIris数据集：通过VR头显采集564个对象的499,791张眼部图像，是目前最大的公开离轴采集数据集；2) 建立评估协议：在不同挑战因素下对识别方法进行基准测试；3) 提出无需归一化的新范式：直接学习眼部图像，最小化调整，避免传统方法依赖易出错的归一化过程。

Result: 当前主要为经典正面图像设计的识别方法在沉浸式设置中表现不理想，主要原因是依赖易出错的归一化过程。而提出的无需归一化方法尽管简单，但始终优于基于归一化的对应方法，显示出在鲁棒沉浸式识别方面的潜力。

Conclusion: ImmerIris数据集填补了沉浸式虹膜识别领域的数据空白。实验表明，传统基于归一化的方法在离轴虹膜识别中效果不佳，而提出的无需归一化范式为鲁棒沉浸式识别指明了有前景的方向。

Abstract: In egocentric applications such as augmented and virtual reality, immersive
iris recognition is emerging as an accurate and seamless way to identify
persons. While classic systems acquire iris images on-axis, i.e., via dedicated
frontal sensors in controlled settings, the immersive setup primarily captures
off-axis irises through tilt-placed headset cameras, with only mild control in
open scenes. This yields unique challenges, including perspective distortion,
intensified quality degradations, and intra-class variations in iris texture.
Datasets capturing these challenges remain scarce. To fill this gap, this paper
introduces ImmerIris, a large-scale dataset collected via VR headsets,
containing 499,791 ocular images from 564 subjects. It is, to the best of
current knowledge, the largest public dataset and among the first dedicated to
off-axis acquisition. Based on ImmerIris, evaluation protocols are constructed
to benchmark recognition methods under different challenging factors. Current
methods, primarily designed for classic on-axis imagery, perform
unsatisfactorily on the immersive setup, mainly due to reliance on fallible
normalization. To this end, this paper further proposes a normalization-free
paradigm that directly learns from ocular images with minimal adjustment.
Despite its simplicity, this approach consistently outperforms
normalization-based counterparts, pointing to a promising direction for robust
immersive recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于手势的PD识别系统性能不理想，需要开发更准确的帕金森病严重程度评估方法以支持临床管理和干预开发

Method: 收集手指敲击视频，提取时域、频域和幅度特征，构建CNN-BiLSTM-注意力混合深度学习框架，结合空间和时间特征进行多类PD严重程度分类

Result: 模型在区分五个严重程度类别方面表现出强大性能

Conclusion: 整合时空表征与注意力机制可改进自动化PD严重程度检测，有望成为支持临床医生进行PD监测和进展追踪的非侵入式工具

Abstract: Effective clinical management and intervention development depend on accurate
evaluation of Parkinsons disease (PD) severity. Many researchers have worked on
developing gesture-based PD recognition systems; however, their performance
accuracy is not satisfactory. In this study, we propose a multi-class Parkinson
Disease detection system based on finger tapping using an attention-enhanced
CNN BiLSTM. We collected finger tapping videos and derived temporal, frequency,
and amplitude based features from wrist and hand movements. Then, we proposed a
hybrid deep learning framework integrating CNN, BiLSTM, and attention
mechanisms for multi-class PD severity classification from video-derived motion
features. First, the input sequence is reshaped and passed through a Conv1D
MaxPooling block to capture local spatial dependencies. The resulting feature
maps are fed into a BiLSTM layer to model temporal dynamics. An attention
mechanism focuses on the most informative temporal features, producing a
context vector that is further processed by a second BiLSTM layer. CNN-derived
features and attention-enhanced BiLSTM outputs are concatenated, followed by
dense and dropout layers, before the final softmax classifier outputs the
predicted PD severity level. The model demonstrated strong performance in
distinguishing between the five severity classes, suggesting that integrating
spatial temporal representations with attention mechanisms can improve
automated PD severity detection, making it a promising non-invasive tool to
support clinicians in PD monitoring and progression tracking.

TL;DR: DeepFusionNet架构用于解决暗光图像增强和超分辨率问题，相比现有方法参数更少、性能更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有暗光图像增强方法参数多、计算量大、SSIM和PSNR得分低；超分辨率方法中GAN-based方法复杂，需要更轻量高效的解决方案。

Method: 开发DeepFusionNet架构，使用autoencoder-based方法，参数数量大幅减少（暗光增强约250万参数，超分辨率约10万参数）。

Result: 暗光增强：在LOL-v1数据集上SSIM 92.8%、PSNR 26.30；超分辨率：PSNR 25.30、SSIM 80.7%。

Conclusion: DeepFusionNet在保持高性能的同时显著减少了参数数量，为实时图像处理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Computer vision and image processing applications suffer from dark and
low-light images, particularly during real-time image transmission. Currently,
low light and dark images are converted to bright and colored forms using
autoencoders; however, these methods often achieve low SSIM and PSNR scores and
require high computational power due to their large number of parameters. To
address these challenges, the DeepFusionNet architecture has been developed.
According to the results obtained with the LOL-v1 dataset, DeepFusionNet
achieved an SSIM of 92.8% and a PSNR score of 26.30, while containing only
approximately 2.5 million parameters. On the other hand, conversion of blurry
and low-resolution images into high-resolution and blur-free images has gained
importance in image processing applications. Unlike GAN-based super-resolution
methods, an autoencoder-based super resolution model has been developed that
contains approximately 100 thousand parameters and uses the DeepFusionNet
architecture. According to the results of the tests, the DeepFusionNet based
super-resolution method achieved a PSNR of 25.30 and a SSIM score of 80.7
percent according to the validation set.

Conclusion: YOLOv11-Litchi适用于复杂果园环境中的无人机荔枝检测，在精准农业中具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Litchi is a high-value fruit, yet traditional manual selection methods are
increasingly inadequate for modern production demands. Integrating UAV-based
aerial imagery with deep learning offers a promising solution to enhance
efficiency and reduce costs. This paper introduces YOLOv11-Litchi, a
lightweight and robust detection model specifically designed for UAV-based
litchi detection. Built upon the YOLOv11 framework, the proposed model
addresses key challenges such as small target size, large model parameters
hindering deployment, and frequent target occlusion. To tackle these issues,
three major innovations are incorporated: a multi-scale residual module to
improve contextual feature extraction across scales, a lightweight feature
fusion method to reduce model size and computational costs while maintaining
high accuracy, and a litchi occlusion detection head to mitigate occlusion
effects by emphasizing target regions and suppressing background interference.
Experimental results validate the model's effectiveness. YOLOv11-Litchi
achieves a parameter size of 6.35 MB - 32.5% smaller than the YOLOv11 baseline
- while improving mAP by 2.5% to 90.1% and F1-Score by 1.4% to 85.5%.
Additionally, the model achieves a frame rate of 57.2 FPS, meeting real-time
detection requirements. These findings demonstrate the suitability of
YOLOv11-Litchi for UAV-based litchi detection in complex orchard environments,
showcasing its potential for broader applications in precision agriculture.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Color3D是一个用于从单色输入对静态和动态3D场景进行着色的高度适应性框架，通过个性化颜色映射确保跨视图和时间的一致性，同时保持色彩多样性和用户可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注静态场景，通过平均颜色变化来强制多视图一致性，但这牺牲了色彩丰富性和可控性。需要一种能同时保持色彩多样性和可控性，同时确保跨视图和时间一致性的方法。

Method: 核心思路是仅对一个关键视图进行着色，然后微调个性化颜色器将颜色传播到新视图和时间步。通过个性化学习场景特定的确定性颜色映射，利用其固有归纳偏置将对应颜色一致投影到新视图和视频帧。

Result: 在多样化静态和动态3D着色基准测试中，该方法能够提供更一致和色彩丰富的渲染结果，具有精确的用户控制能力。

Conclusion: 该框架巧妙地将复杂的3D着色问题重新表述为更易处理的单图像范式，允许无缝集成任意图像着色模型，增强了灵活性和可控性。

Abstract: In this work, we present Color3D, a highly adaptable framework for colorizing
both static and dynamic 3D scenes from monochromatic inputs, delivering
visually diverse and chromatically vibrant reconstructions with flexible
user-guided control. In contrast to existing methods that focus solely on
static scenarios and enforce multi-view consistency by averaging color
variations which inevitably sacrifice both chromatic richness and
controllability, our approach is able to preserve color diversity and
steerability while ensuring cross-view and cross-time consistency. In
particular, the core insight of our method is to colorize only a single key
view and then fine-tune a personalized colorizer to propagate its color to
novel views and time steps. Through personalization, the colorizer learns a
scene-specific deterministic color mapping underlying the reference view,
enabling it to consistently project corresponding colors to the content in
novel views and video frames via its inherent inductive bias. Once trained, the
personalized colorizer can be applied to infer consistent chrominance for all
other images, enabling direct reconstruction of colorful 3D scenes with a
dedicated Lab color space Gaussian splatting representation. The proposed
framework ingeniously recasts complicated 3D colorization as a more tractable
single image paradigm, allowing seamless integration of arbitrary image
colorization models with enhanced flexibility and controllability. Extensive
experiments across diverse static and dynamic 3D colorization benchmarks
substantiate that our method can deliver more consistent and chromatically rich
renderings with precise user control. Project Page

from MRI. Our implementation demonstrates promising results in localizing
occluded vessels on stroke-affected T1 MRI scans, with potential for faster and

TL;DR: ReMix是一个统一的角色一致性生成和编辑框架，包含ReMix模块和IP-ControlNet两个核心组件，解决了现有方法在身份一致性和空间可控性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以在单个框架中统一角色一致性生成和编辑任务。基于生成的方法在跨实例的细粒度身份一致性方面存在困难，而基于编辑的方法往往失去空间可控性和指令对齐。

Method: ReMix模块利用MLLM的多模态推理能力编辑输入图像的语义特征，无需微调即可将指令嵌入适配到原生DiT主干。IP-ControlNet将ControlNet扩展到从参考图像解耦语义和布局线索，并在共享噪声空间中引入ε-等变潜在空间来联合去噪参考图像和目标图像。

Result: ReMix支持个性化生成、图像编辑、风格迁移和多条件合成等多种任务。大量实验验证了其作为角色一致性图像生成和编辑统一框架的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: ReMix通过创新的模块设计和潜在空间优化，成功实现了角色一致性生成和编辑的统一，在保持身份一致性的同时提供了良好的空间可控性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., FLUX.1)
have greatly improved visual fidelity in consistent character generation and
editing. However, existing methods rarely unify these tasks within a single
framework. Generation-based approaches struggle with fine-grained identity
consistency across instances, while editing-based methods often lose spatial
controllability and instruction alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose
ReMix, a unified framework for character-consistent generation and editing. It
constitutes two core components: the ReMix Module and IP-ControlNet. The ReMix
Module leverages the multimodal reasoning ability of MLLMs to edit semantic
features of input images and adapt instruction embeddings to the native DiT
backbone without fine-tuning. While this ensures coherent semantic layouts,
pixel-level consistency and pose controllability remain challenging. To address
this, IP-ControlNet extends ControlNet to decouple semantic and layout cues
from reference images and introduces an {\epsilon}-equivariant latent space
that jointly denoises the reference and target images within a shared noise
space. Inspired by convergent evolution and quantum decoherence,i.e., where
environmental noise drives state convergence, this design promotes feature
alignment in the hidden space, enabling consistent object generation while
preserving identity. ReMix supports a wide range of tasks, including
personalized generation, image editing, style transfer, and multi-condition
synthesis. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness and efficiency as a
unified framework for character-consistent image generation and editing.

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) aims to segment the target object in an
image given a natural language expression. While recent methods leverage
pre-trained vision backbones and more training corpus to achieve impressive
results, they predominantly focus on simple expressions--short, clear noun
phrases like "red car" or "left girl". This simplification often reduces RIS to
a key word/concept matching problem, limiting the model's ability to handle
referential ambiguity in expressions. In this work, we identify two challenging
real-world scenarios: object-distracting expressions, which involve multiple
entities with contextual cues, and category-implicit expressions, where the
object class is not explicitly stated. To address the challenges, we propose a
novel framework, SaFiRe, which mimics the human two-phase cognitive
process--first forming a global understanding, then refining it through
detail-oriented inspection. This is naturally supported by Mamba's
scan-then-update property, which aligns with our phased design and enables
efficient multi-cycle refinement with linear complexity. We further introduce
aRefCOCO, a new benchmark designed to evaluate RIS models under ambiguous
referring expressions. Extensive experiments on both standard and proposed
datasets demonstrate the superiority of SaFiRe over state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像语义分割对生态监测至关重要，但获取密集专家标注成本高昂，而稀疏点标注虽然容易获取，但面临标注点选择和稀疏信息传播的挑战。

Method: 采用主动采样策略指导标注者选择最有价值的点，然后结合SAM2和超像素方法的混合方法传播稀疏标签。

Conclusion: 开发并发布了一个简单有效的交互式标注工具，使生态研究人员能够利用基础模型和计算机视觉高效生成高质量分割掩码。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is essential to automate underwater imagery analysis
with ecology monitoring purposes. Unfortunately, fine grained underwater scene
analysis is still an open problem even for top performing segmentation models.
The high cost of obtaining dense, expert-annotated, segmentation labels hinders
the supervision of models in this domain. While sparse point-labels are easier
to obtain, they introduce challenges regarding which points to annotate and how
to propagate the sparse information. We present SparseUWSeg, a novel framework
that addresses both issues. SparseUWSeg employs an active sampling strategy to
guide annotators, maximizing the value of their point labels. Then, it
propagates these sparse labels with a hybrid approach leverages both the best
of SAM2 and superpixel-based methods. Experiments on two diverse underwater
datasets demonstrate the benefits of SparseUWSeg over state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving up to +5\% mIoU over D+NN. Our main contribution is the
design and release of a simple but effective interactive annotation tool,
integrating our algorithms. It enables ecology researchers to leverage
foundation models and computer vision to efficiently generate high-quality
segmentation masks to process their data.

TL;DR: ViConEx-Med是一个基于Transformer的可视化概念解释框架，通过多概念可学习token联合预测和定位视觉概念，在医学应用中提供概念级定位图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念模型将概念视为数值属性，缺乏可视化解释来定位预测概念，限制了在医疗等高风险场景中的实用性。

Method: 提出基于Transformer的框架，使用多概念可学习token，通过专门的注意力层处理视觉和文本概念token，生成概念级定位图。

Result: 在合成和真实医学数据集上的实验表明，ViConEx-Med在概念检测和定位精度方面优于现有概念模型，与黑盒模型性能相当。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建基于视觉概念的内在可解释模型提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Concept-based models aim to explain model decisions with human-understandable
concepts. However, most existing approaches treat concepts as numerical
attributes, without providing complementary visual explanations that could
localize the predicted concepts. This limits their utility in real-world
applications and particularly in high-stakes scenarios, such as medical
use-cases. This paper proposes ViConEx-Med, a novel transformer-based framework
for visual concept explainability, which introduces multi-concept learnable
tokens to jointly predict and localize visual concepts. By leveraging
specialized attention layers for processing visual and text-based concept
tokens, our method produces concept-level localization maps while maintaining
high predictive accuracy. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world medical
datasets demonstrate that ViConEx-Med outperforms prior concept-based models
and achieves competitive performance with black-box models in terms of both
concept detection and localization precision. Our results suggest a promising
direction for building inherently interpretable models grounded in visual
concepts. Code is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注物体前表面的3D坐标预测精度，忽视了后表面和内部的潜在价值。为了充分利用物体的完整表面和内部信息，本研究预测前后表面的3D坐标并在其间密集采样。

Method: 预测物体前后表面的3D坐标，在两者之间密集采样创建超密集2D-3D对应关系，并提出分层连续坐标编码(HCCE)来更准确高效地表示前后表面坐标。

Result: 在BOP网站的七个经典核心数据集上，该方法均优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过利用物体完整表面和内部信息创建超密集对应关系，结合高效的分层连续坐标编码，显著提升了姿态估计的精度。

Abstract: In pose estimation for seen objects, a prevalent pipeline involves using
neural networks to predict dense 3D coordinates of the object surface on 2D
images, which are then used to establish dense 2D-3D correspondences. However,
current methods primarily focus on more efficient encoding techniques to
improve the precision of predicted 3D coordinates on the object's front
surface, overlooking the potential benefits of incorporating the back surface
and interior of the object. To better utilize the full surface and interior of
the object, this study predicts 3D coordinates of both the object's front and
back surfaces and densely samples 3D coordinates between them. This process
creates ultra-dense 2D-3D correspondences, effectively enhancing pose
estimation accuracy based on the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm.
Additionally, we propose Hierarchical Continuous Coordinate Encoding (HCCE) to
provide a more accurate and efficient representation of front and back surface
coordinates. Experimental results show that, compared to existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the BOP website, the proposed approach
outperforms across seven classic BOP core datasets. Code is available at

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become powerful platforms for real-time,
high-resolution data collection, producing massive volumes of aerial videos.
Efficient retrieval of relevant content from these videos is crucial for
applications in urban management, emergency response, security, and disaster
relief. While text-video retrieval has advanced in natural video domains, the
UAV domain remains underexplored due to limitations in existing datasets, such
as coarse and redundant captions. Thus, in this work, we construct the Drone
Video-Text Match Dataset (DVTMD), which contains 2,864 videos and 14,320
fine-grained, semantically diverse captions. The annotations capture multiple
complementary aspects, including human actions, objects, background settings,
environmental conditions, and visual style, thereby enhancing text-video
correspondence and reducing redundancy. Building on this dataset, we propose
the Text-Conditioned Multi-granularity Alignment (TCMA) framework, which
integrates global video-sentence alignment, sentence-guided frame aggregation,
and word-guided patch alignment. To further refine local alignment, we design a
Word and Patch Selection module that filters irrelevant content, as well as a
Text-Adaptive Dynamic Temperature Mechanism that adapts attention sharpness to
text type. Extensive experiments on DVTMD and CapERA establish the first
complete benchmark for drone text-video retrieval. Our TCMA achieves
state-of-the-art performance, including 45.5% R@1 in text-to-video and 42.8%
R@1 in video-to-text retrieval, demonstrating the effectiveness of our dataset
and method. The code and dataset will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为伪平衡的方法，用于在半监督学习中缓解人脸性别分类模型的人口统计学偏见，通过仅使用未标记图像实现公平性提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸性别分类模型经常反映并放大训练数据中的人口统计学偏见，导致在不同性别和种族子组中表现不均。需要一种简单有效的方法来缓解这种偏见。

Method: 引入伪平衡策略，在伪标签选择过程中强制实施人口统计学平衡，仅使用来自种族平衡数据集的未标记图像，无需真实标注。

Result: 伪平衡方法在整体准确率达到79.81%，比基线提高6.53%，性别准确率差距减少44.17%。在东亚子组中，基线差距超过49%，该方法将差距缩小到仅5.01%。

Conclusion: 即使在缺乏标签监督的情况下，访问人口统计学平衡或适度倾斜的未标记数据集可以作为消除现有计算机视觉模型偏见的有力资源。

Abstract: Face gender classification models often reflect and amplify demographic
biases present in their training data, leading to uneven performance across
gender and racial subgroups. We introduce pseudo-balancing, a simple and
effective strategy for mitigating such biases in semi-supervised learning. Our
method enforces demographic balance during pseudo-label selection, using only
unlabeled images from a race-balanced dataset without requiring access to
ground-truth annotations.
  We evaluate pseudo-balancing under two conditions: (1) fine-tuning a biased
gender classifier using unlabeled images from the FairFace dataset, and (2)
stress-testing the method with intentionally imbalanced training data to
simulate controlled bias scenarios. In both cases, models are evaluated on the
All-Age-Faces (AAF) benchmark, which contains a predominantly East Asian
population. Our results show that pseudo-balancing consistently improves
fairness while preserving or enhancing accuracy. The method achieves 79.81%
overall accuracy - a 6.53% improvement over the baseline - and reduces the
gender accuracy gap by 44.17%. In the East Asian subgroup, where baseline
disparities exceeded 49%, the gap is narrowed to just 5.01%. These findings
suggest that even in the absence of label supervision, access to a
demographically balanced or moderately skewed unlabeled dataset can serve as a
powerful resource for debiasing existing computer vision models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法仅建模成对物体关系，忽略了n元组合在多模态关系理解中的全局感知重要性，导致3D-语言对齐困难。

Method: 扩展关系学习从二元到n元，设计分组监督损失促进n元关系学习，在多模态场景图中使用混合注意力机制进一步定位目标。

Result: 在ReferIt3D和ScanRefer基准测试中优于最先进方法，证明了n元关系感知在3D定位中的优势。

Conclusion: n元关系感知显著提升了3D物体定位性能，证明了全局关系理解的重要性。

Abstract: Localizing 3D objects using natural language is essential for robotic scene
understanding. The descriptions often involve multiple spatial relationships to
distinguish similar objects, making 3D-language alignment difficult. Current
methods only model relationships for pairwise objects, ignoring the global
perceptual significance of n-ary combinations in multi-modal relational
understanding. To address this, we propose a novel progressive relational
learning framework for 3D object grounding. We extend relational learning from
binary to n-ary to identify visual relations that match the referential
description globally. Given the absence of specific annotations for referred
objects in the training data, we design a grouped supervision loss to
facilitate n-ary relational learning. In the scene graph created with n-ary
relationships, we use a multi-modal network with hybrid attention mechanisms to
further localize the target within the n-ary combinations. Experiments and
ablation studies on the ReferIt3D and ScanRefer benchmarks demonstrate that our
method outperforms the state-of-the-art, and proves the advantages of the n-ary
relational perception in 3D localization.

Conclusion: CerS-Path系统在宫颈病理学领域取得显著进展，展示了亚专科诊断转化和宫颈癌筛查的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a major malignancy, necessitating extensive and
complex histopathological assessments and comprehensive support tools. Although
deep learning shows promise, these models still lack accuracy and
generalizability. General foundation models offer a broader reach but remain
limited in capturing subspecialty-specific features and task adaptability. We
introduce the Cervical Subspecialty Pathology (CerS-Path) diagnostic system,
developed through two synergistic pretraining stages: self-supervised learning
on approximately 190 million tissue patches from 140,000 slides to build a
cervical-specific feature extractor, and multimodal enhancement with 2.5
million image-text pairs, followed by integration with multiple downstream
diagnostic functions. Supporting eight diagnostic functions, including rare
cancer classification and multimodal Q&A, CerS-Path surpasses prior foundation
models in scope and clinical applicability. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate a significant advance in cervical pathology, with prospective
testing on 3,173 cases across five centers maintaining 99.38% screening
sensitivity and excellent generalizability, highlighting its potential for
subspecialty diagnostic translation and cervical cancer screening.

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of autonomous driving perception systems requires
extensive environment-based testing, yet real-world execution is often
impractical. Synthetic datasets have therefore emerged as a promising
alternative, offering advantages such as cost-effectiveness, bias free
labeling, and controllable scenarios. However, the domain gap between synthetic
and real-world datasets remains a critical bottleneck for the generalization of
AI-based autonomous driving models. Quantifying this synthetic-to-real gap is
thus essential for evaluating dataset utility and guiding the design of more
effective training pipelines. In this paper, we establish a systematic
framework for quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap in autonomous driving
systems, and propose Style Embedding Distribution Discrepancy (SEDD) as a novel
evaluation metric. Our framework combines Gram matrix-based style extraction
with metric learning optimized for intra-class compactness and inter-class
separation to extract style embeddings. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark
using publicly available datasets. Experiments are conducted on a variety of
datasets and sim-to-real methods, and the results show that our method is
capable of quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap. This work provides a
standardized quality control tool that enables systematic diagnosis and
targeted enhancement of synthetic datasets, advancing future development of
data-driven autonomous driving systems.

Conclusion: AnomReason和AnomAgent为测量和改进AI生成图像的语义合理性提供了基础，在可解释深度伪造检测和图像生成器语义合理性评估中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of
  AI-generated content (AIGC) has enabled the synthesis of visually convincing
images; however, many such outputs exhibit subtle \textbf{semantic anomalies},
including unrealistic object configurations, violations of physical laws, or
commonsense inconsistencies, which compromise the overall plausibility of the
generated scenes. Detecting these semantic-level anomalies
  is essential for assessing the trustworthiness of AIGC media, especially in
AIGC image analysis, explainable deepfake detection and semantic authenticity
assessment. In this paper,
  we formalize \textbf{semantic anomaly detection and reasoning} for AIGC
images and
  introduce \textbf{AnomReason}, a large-scale benchmark with structured
annotations as quadruples \emph{(Name, Phenomenon, Reasoning, Severity)}.
Annotations are produced by
  a modular multi-agent pipeline (\textbf{AnomAgent}) with lightweight
human-in-the-loop verification, enabling scale while preserving quality.
  At construction time, AnomAgent processed approximately 4.17\,B GPT-4o
tokens, providing scale evidence for the resulting structured annotations. We
further
  show that models fine-tuned on AnomReason achieve consistent gains over
strong vision-language baselines under our proposed semantic matching metric
(\textit{SemAP} and \textit{SemF1}).
  Applications to {explainable deepfake detection} and {semantic reasonableness
assessment of image generators} demonstrate practical utility. In summary,
AnomReason and AnomAgent
  serve as a foundation for measuring and improving the semantic plausibility
of AI-generated images. We will release code, metrics, data, and task-aligned
models to support reproducible research on semantic authenticity and
interpretable AIGC forensics.

Abstract: Recent advances in large generative models have shown that simple
autoregressive formulations, when scaled appropriately, can exhibit strong
zero-shot generalization across domains. Motivated by this trend, we
investigate whether autoregressive video modeling principles can be directly
applied to medical imaging tasks, despite the model never being trained on
medical data. Specifically, we evaluate a large vision model (LVM) in a
zero-shot setting across four representative tasks: organ segmentation,
denoising, super-resolution, and motion prediction. Remarkably, even without
domain-specific fine-tuning, the LVM can delineate anatomical structures in CT
scans and achieve competitive performance on segmentation, denoising, and
super-resolution. Most notably, in radiotherapy motion prediction, the model
forecasts future 3D CT phases directly from prior phases of a 4D CT scan,
producing anatomically consistent predictions that capture patient-specific
respiratory dynamics with realistic temporal coherence. We evaluate the LVM on
4D CT data from 122 patients, totaling over 1,820 3D CT volumes. Despite no
prior exposure to medical data, the model achieves strong performance across
all tasks and surpasses specialized DVF-based and generative baselines in
motion prediction, achieving state-of-the-art spatial accuracy. These findings
reveal the emergence of zero-shot capabilities in medical video modeling and
highlight the potential of general-purpose video models to serve as unified
learners and reasoners laying the groundwork for future medical foundation
models built on video models.

*Abdelrhman Elrawy,Emad A. Mohammed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个改进3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)在少样本场景下效率的框架，通过使用不透明度梯度作为渲染误差的轻量级代理来替换标准的位置梯度启发式方法，并结合更保守的修剪策略，显著减少基元数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS在少样本场景中容易过拟合并产生臃肿的重建结果，现有方法如FSGS虽然提高了质量但显著增加了基元数量，需要优化核心3DGS算法以优先考虑效率。

Method: 用基于不透明度梯度的新型致密化触发器替换标准位置梯度启发式方法，结合更保守的修剪策略防止破坏性优化循环，并使用标准深度相关损失进行几何指导。

Result: 在3视图LLFF数据集上，模型比FSGS紧凑40%以上（32k vs. 57k基元）；在Mip-NeRF 360数据集上实现约70%的减少，在重建指标上仅有适度折衷。

Conclusion: 该框架在少样本视图合成的质量与效率帕累托前沿上建立了新的最先进水平，实现了紧凑性的显著提升。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles in few-shot scenarios, where its
standard adaptive density control (ADC) can lead to overfitting and bloated
reconstructions. While state-of-the-art methods like FSGS improve quality, they
often do so by significantly increasing the primitive count. This paper
presents a framework that revises the core 3DGS optimization to prioritize
efficiency. We replace the standard positional gradient heuristic with a novel
densification trigger that uses the opacity gradient as a lightweight proxy for
rendering error. We find this aggressive densification is only effective when
paired with a more conservative pruning schedule, which prevents destructive
optimization cycles. Combined with a standard depth-correlation loss for
geometric guidance, our framework demonstrates a fundamental improvement in
efficiency. On the 3-view LLFF dataset, our model is over 40% more compact (32k
vs. 57k primitives) than FSGS, and on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset, it achieves a
reduction of approximately 70%. This dramatic gain in compactness is achieved
with a modest trade-off in reconstruction metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art on the quality-vs-efficiency Pareto frontier for few-shot view
synthesis.

TL;DR: VividAnimator是一个端到端的框架，通过音频和稀疏手部姿态条件生成高质量半身人体动画，解决了现有方法中头部运动僵硬和手部模糊的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频和姿态驱动的人体动画方法存在头部运动僵硬和手部模糊的问题，主要由于音频与头部运动相关性弱以及手部结构复杂。

Method: 提出三个关键创新：1) 预训练手部清晰度码本(HCC)编码高保真手部纹理先验；2) 双流音频感知模块(DSAA)分别建模唇部同步和自然头部姿态动态；3) 姿态校准技巧(PCT)通过放松刚性约束来优化姿态条件。

Result: 大量实验表明VividAnimator达到最先进性能，生成具有优越手部细节、手势真实性和身份一致性的视频。

Conclusion: 该框架通过创新的码本预训练、双流建模和姿态校准技术，有效解决了音频驱动动画中的关键问题，实现了高质量的人体动画生成。

Abstract: Existing for audio- and pose-driven human animation methods often struggle
with stiff head movements and blurry hands, primarily due to the weak
correlation between audio and head movements and the structural complexity of
hands. To address these issues, we propose VividAnimator, an end-to-end
framework for generating high-quality, half-body human animations driven by
audio and sparse hand pose conditions. Our framework introduces three key
innovations. First, to overcome the instability and high cost of online
codebook training, we pre-train a Hand Clarity Codebook (HCC) that encodes
rich, high-fidelity hand texture priors, significantly mitigating hand
degradation. Second, we design a Dual-Stream Audio-Aware Module (DSAA) to model
lip synchronization and natural head pose dynamics separately while enabling
interaction. Third, we introduce a Pose Calibration Trick (PCT) that refines
and aligns pose conditions by relaxing rigid constraints, ensuring smooth and
natural gesture transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Vivid
Animator achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing videos with superior
hand detail, gesture realism, and identity consistency, validated by both
quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations.

TL;DR: DualViewDistill是一个结合透视视图和鸟瞰图特征的混合检测跟踪框架，通过基础模型引导的BEV地图和DINOv2特征蒸馏来提升3D目标检测和跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的方法通常只依赖透视视图或鸟瞰图特征，无法同时利用细粒度目标细节和空间结构化场景表示。

Method: 提出BEV地图由基础模型引导，利用描述性DINOv2特征通过新颖的蒸馏过程蒸馏到BEV表示中，并通过可变形聚合集成PV特征和BEV地图。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse 2基准测试上的广泛实验表明，DualViewDistill实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 结果展示了基础模型BEV地图在实现更可靠的自动驾驶感知方面的潜力。

Abstract: Camera-based 3D object detection and tracking are essential for perception in
autonomous driving. Current state-of-the-art approaches often rely exclusively
on either perspective-view (PV) or bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, limiting
their ability to leverage both fine-grained object details and spatially
structured scene representations. In this work, we propose DualViewDistill, a
hybrid detection and tracking framework that incorporates both PV and BEV
camera image features to leverage their complementary strengths. Our approach
introduces BEV maps guided by foundation models, leveraging descriptive DINOv2
features that are distilled into BEV representations through a novel
distillation process. By integrating PV features with BEV maps enriched with
semantic and geometric features from DINOv2, our model leverages this hybrid
representation via deformable aggregation to enhance 3D object detection and
tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 benchmarks
demonstrate that DualViewDistill achieves state-of-the-art performance. The
results showcase the potential of foundation model BEV maps to enable more
reliable perception for autonomous driving. We make the code and pre-trained
models available at https://dualviewdistill.cs.uni-freiburg.de .

TL;DR: SAM2LoRA是一种参数高效的微调策略，通过集成低秩适配器到图像编码器和掩码解码器中，仅需少于5%的可训练参数来适配Segment Anything Model 2用于眼底图像分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2虽然在低资源设置下能实现快速推理，但其微调仍然具有挑战性。需要开发参数高效的微调方法来适应眼底图像分割任务。

Method: 在图像编码器和掩码解码器中集成低秩适配器，使用结合分割BCE、SoftDice和FocalTversky损失的复合损失函数进行网络优化。

Result: 在11个具有挑战性的眼底分割数据集上评估，SAM2LoRA在跨数据集训练条件下在血管和视盘分割方面表现出高性能，Dice分数分别达到0.86和0.93，AUC值分别达到0.98和0.99。

Conclusion: SAM2LoRA在显著减少训练开销的同时实现了最先进的性能，为眼底图像分割提供了一种高效的微调解决方案。

Abstract: We propose SAM2LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that adapts
the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for fundus image segmentation. SAM2 employs
a masked autoencoder-pretrained Hierarchical Vision Transformer for multi-scale
feature decoding, enabling rapid inference in low-resource settings; however,
fine-tuning remains challenging. To address this, SAM2LoRA integrates a
low-rank adapter into both the image encoder and mask decoder, requiring fewer
than 5\% of the original trainable parameters. Our analysis indicates that for
cross-dataset fundus segmentation tasks, a composite loss function combining
segmentationBCE, SoftDice, and FocalTversky losses is essential for optimal
network tuning. Evaluated on 11 challenging fundus segmentation datasets,
SAM2LoRA demonstrates high performance in both blood vessel and optic disc
segmentation under cross-dataset training conditions. It achieves Dice scores
of up to 0.86 and 0.93 for blood vessel and optic disc segmentation,
respectively, and AUC values of up to 0.98 and 0.99, achieving state-of-the-art
performance while substantially reducing training overhead.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FactoredScenes是一个通过分解场景为层次化概念来合成逼真3D场景的框架，利用房间结构和学习真实场景中的物体姿态变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界场景（如ScanNet）难以捕捉，可用数据有限。生成具有多样化物体姿态的逼真场景仍然是一个开放且具有挑战性的任务。

Method: 引入分解表示法，将场景分解为层次化组织的房间程序和物体姿态概念。学习可重用布局模式的函数库，使用大语言模型生成高级程序，并学习程序条件模型来层次化预测物体姿态。

Result: FactoredScenes生成了难以与真实ScanNet场景区分的逼真现实世界房间。

Conclusion: 该框架成功利用场景结构和物体姿态变化学习来合成逼真的3D场景。

Abstract: Real-world scenes, such as those in ScanNet, are difficult to capture, with
highly limited data available. Generating realistic scenes with varied object
poses remains an open and challenging task. In this work, we propose
FactoredScenes, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D scenes by leveraging
the underlying structure of rooms while learning the variation of object poses
from lived-in scenes. We introduce a factored representation that decomposes
scenes into hierarchically organized concepts of room programs and object
poses. To encode structure, FactoredScenes learns a library of functions
capturing reusable layout patterns from which scenes are drawn, then uses large
language models to generate high-level programs, regularized by the learned
library. To represent scene variations, FactoredScenes learns a
program-conditioned model to hierarchically predict object poses, and retrieves
and places 3D objects in a scene. We show that FactoredScenes generates
realistic, real-world rooms that are difficult to distinguish from real ScanNet
scenes.

Conclusion: 该框架在交通拥堵分类中表现出色，未来可进一步整合车辆尺寸和精细化密度指标来提升性能。

Abstract: Accurate traffic congestion classification is essential for intelligent
transportation systems and real-time urban traffic management. This paper
presents a multimodal framework combining open-vocabulary visual-language
reasoning (CLIP), object detection (YOLO-World), and motion analysis via
MOG2-based background subtraction. The system predicts congestion levels on an
ordinal scale from 1 (free flow) to 5 (severe congestion), enabling
semantically aligned and temporally consistent classification. To enhance
interpretability, we incorporate motion-based confidence weighting and generate
annotated visual outputs. Experimental results show the model achieves 76.7
percent accuracy, an F1 score of 0.752, and a Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of
0.684, significantly outperforming unimodal baselines. These results
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in preserving ordinal structure and
leveraging visual-language and motion modalities. Future enhancements include
incorporating vehicle sizing and refined density metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI驱动的作物健康监测系统在资源受限条件下难以达到传统摄影测量所需的70-80%图像重叠率，导致重建质量下降，阻碍了农民对自主监测技术的采用。

Method: 使用光流估计在连续航拍帧之间合成过渡图像，人工增强特征对应关系以改进几何重建，从而在减少重叠率要求的情况下生成可靠的正射影像。

Result: 实验验证表明，该方法可将最小重叠率要求降低20%，提高了在稀疏图像数据集条件下生成正射影像的可靠性。

Conclusion: Ortho-Fuse框架通过光学流技术有效解决了AI驱动作物监测系统在资源受限环境下的技术限制，为精准农业中AI监测系统的更好集成提供了可行路径。

Abstract: AI-driven crop health mapping systems offer substantial advantages over
conventional monitoring approaches through accelerated data acquisition and
cost reduction. However, widespread farmer adoption remains constrained by
technical limitations in orthomosaic generation from sparse aerial imagery
datasets. Traditional photogrammetric reconstruction requires 70-80\%
inter-image overlap to establish sufficient feature correspondences for
accurate geometric registration. AI-driven systems operating under
resource-constrained conditions cannot consistently achieve these overlap
thresholds, resulting in degraded reconstruction quality that undermines user
confidence in autonomous monitoring technologies. In this paper, we present
Ortho-Fuse, an optical flow-based framework that enables the generation of a
reliable orthomosaic with reduced overlap requirements. Our approach employs
intermediate flow estimation to synthesize transitional imagery between
consecutive aerial frames, artificially augmenting feature correspondences for
improved geometric reconstruction. Experimental validation demonstrates a 20\%
reduction in minimum overlap requirements. We further analyze adoption barriers
in precision agriculture to identify pathways for enhanced integration of
AI-driven monitoring systems.

Method: 提出PointMAC框架，使用元辅助学习策略，在测试时通过优化两个自监督辅助目标（模拟结构和传感器级不完整性）来适应共享编码器，同时引入自适应λ校准机制来平衡主任务和辅助目标的梯度。

Result: 在合成、模拟和真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，PointMAC通过逐个样本细化实现了最先进的补全质量。

Conclusion: PointMAC是首个将元辅助测试时适应应用于点云补全的工作，能够有效提升模型对未知结构和传感器失真的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Point cloud completion is essential for robust 3D perception in
safety-critical applications such as robotics and augmented reality. However,
existing models perform static inference and rely heavily on inductive biases
learned during training, limiting their ability to adapt to novel structural
patterns and sensor-induced distortions at test time. To address this
limitation, we propose PointMAC, a meta-learned framework for robust test-time
adaptation in point cloud completion. It enables sample-specific refinement
without requiring additional supervision. Our method optimizes the completion
model under two self-supervised auxiliary objectives that simulate structural
and sensor-level incompleteness. A meta-auxiliary learning strategy based on
Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) ensures that adaptation driven by auxiliary
objectives is consistently aligned with the primary completion task. During
inference, we adapt the shared encoder on-the-fly by optimizing auxiliary
losses, with the decoder kept fixed. To further stabilize adaptation, we
introduce Adaptive $\lambda$-Calibration, a meta-learned mechanism for
balancing gradients between primary and auxiliary objectives. Extensive
experiments on synthetic, simulated, and real-world datasets demonstrate that
PointMAC achieves state-of-the-art results by refining each sample individually
to produce high-quality completions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to apply meta-auxiliary test-time adaptation to point cloud
completion.

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor in wearable and clinical devices provides
valuable physiological insights in a non-invasive and real-time fashion.
Specialized Foundation Models (FM) or repurposed time-series FMs are used to
benchmark physiological tasks. Our experiments with fine-tuning FMs reveal that
Vision FM (VFM) can also be utilized for this purpose and, in fact,
surprisingly leads to state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on many tasks,
notably blood pressure estimation. We leverage VFMs by simply transforming
one-dimensional PPG signals into image-like two-dimensional representations,
such as the Short-Time Fourier transform (STFT). Using the latest VFMs, such as
DINOv3 and SIGLIP-2, we achieve promising performance on other vital signs and
blood lab measurement tasks as well. Our proposal, Vision4PPG, unlocks a new
class of FMs to achieve SOTA performance with notable generalization to other
2D input representations, including STFT phase and recurrence plots. Our work
improves upon prior investigations of vision models for PPG by conducting a
comprehensive study, comparing them to state-of-the-art time-series FMs, and
demonstrating the general PPG processing ability by reporting results on six
additional tasks. Thus, we provide clinician-scientists with a new set of
powerful tools that is also computationally efficient, thanks to
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques.

Abstract: Pavement crack detection has long depended on costly and time-intensive
pixel-level annotations, which limit its scalability for large-scale
infrastructure monitoring. To overcome this barrier, this paper examines the
feasibility of achieving effective pixel-level crack segmentation entirely
without manual annotations. Building on this objective, a fully self-supervised
framework, Crack-Segmenter, is developed, integrating three complementary
modules: the Scale-Adaptive Embedder (SAE) for robust multi-scale feature
extraction, the Directional Attention Transformer (DAT) for maintaining linear
crack continuity, and the Attention-Guided Fusion (AGF) module for adaptive
feature integration. Through evaluations on ten public datasets,
Crack-Segmenter consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art supervised methods
across all major metrics, including mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice
score, XOR, and Hausdorff Distance (HD). These findings demonstrate that
annotation-free crack detection is not only feasible but also superior,
enabling transportation agencies and infrastructure managers to conduct
scalable and cost-effective monitoring. This work advances self-supervised
learning and motivates pavement cracks detection research.

### [74] [Identifying bias in CNN image classification using image scrambling and transforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10383)
*Sai Teja Erukude*

TL;DR: 该论文讨论了CNN中的隐藏偏见问题，提出了识别数据集偏见的方法，包括图像分块随机化和多种图像变换技术，以区分上下文信息和背景噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN作为黑盒模型难以解释决策过程，容易受到背景信息的偏见影响，需要开发方法来识别这些隐藏偏见。

Method: 提出两种方法：1）将图像分割成非重叠小块并随机打乱；2）应用傅里叶变换、小波变换和中值滤波器等图像变换技术来恢复背景噪声信息。

Result: 在六个不同数据集（自然、合成和混合数据集）上测试表明，这些方法能有效区分上下文信息和背景噪声，无需背景信息即可检测背景噪声的存在。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效识别CNN中的数据集偏见，帮助区分真正的上下文学习和背景噪声，提高模型的可解释性。

Abstract: CNNs are now prevalent as the primary choice for most machine vision problems
due to their superior rate of classification and the availability of
user-friendly libraries. These networks effortlessly identify and select
features in a non-intuitive data-driven manner, making it difficult to
determine which features were most influential. That leads to a ``black box",
where users cannot know how the image data are analyzed but rely on empirical
results. Therefore the decision-making process can be biased by background
information that is difficult to detect. Here we discuss examples of such
hidden biases and propose techniques for identifying them, methods to
distinguish between contextual information and background noise, and explore
whether CNNs learn from irrelevant features. One effective approach to identify
dataset bias is to classify blank background parts of the images. However, in
some situations a blank background in the images is not available, making it
more difficult to separate the foreground information from the blank
background. Such parts of the image can also be considered contextual learning,
not necessarily bias. To overcome this, we propose two approaches that were
tested on six different datasets, including natural, synthetic, and hybrid
datasets. The first method involves dividing images into smaller,
non-overlapping tiles of various sizes, which are then shuffled randomly,
making classification more challenging. The second method involves the
application of several image transforms, including Fourier, Wavelet transforms,
and Median filter, and their combinations. These transforms help recover
background noise information used by CNN to classify images. Results indicate
that this method can effectively distinguish between contextual information and
background noise, and alert on the presence of background noise even without
the need to use background information.

Conclusion: Mesh-Gait成功地将2D轮廓和3D几何信息相结合，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了步态识别性能，为实时应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Gait recognition, a fundamental biometric technology, leverages unique
walking patterns for individual identification, typically using 2D
representations such as silhouettes or skeletons. However, these methods often
struggle with viewpoint variations, occlusions, and noise. Multi-modal
approaches that incorporate 3D body shape information offer improved robustness
but are computationally expensive, limiting their feasibility for real-time
applications. To address these challenges, we introduce Mesh-Gait, a novel
end-to-end multi-modal gait recognition framework that directly reconstructs 3D
representations from 2D silhouettes, effectively combining the strengths of
both modalities. Compared to existing methods, directly learning 3D features
from 3D joints or meshes is complex and difficult to fuse with silhouette-based
gait features. To overcome this, Mesh-Gait reconstructs 3D heatmaps as an
intermediate representation, enabling the model to effectively capture 3D
geometric information while maintaining simplicity and computational
efficiency. During training, the intermediate 3D heatmaps are gradually
reconstructed and become increasingly accurate under supervised learning, where
the loss is calculated between the reconstructed 3D joints, virtual markers,
and 3D meshes and their corresponding ground truth, ensuring precise spatial
alignment and consistent 3D structure. Mesh-Gait extracts discriminative
features from both silhouettes and reconstructed 3D heatmaps in a
computationally efficient manner. This design enables the model to capture
spatial and structural gait characteristics while avoiding the heavy overhead
of direct 3D reconstruction from RGB videos, allowing the network to focus on
motion dynamics rather than irrelevant visual details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mesh-Gait achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. The code will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Image feature matching plays a vital role in many computer vision tasks.
Although many image feature detection and matching techniques have been
proposed over the past few decades, it is still time-consuming to match feature
points in two images, especially for images with a large number of detected
features. Feature spatial order can estimate the probability that a pair of
features is correct. Since it is a completely independent concept from epipolar
geometry, it can be used to complement epipolar geometry in guiding feature
match in a target region so as to improve matching efficiency. In this paper,
we integrate the concept of feature spatial order into a progressive matching
framework. We use some of the initially matched features to build a
computational model of feature spatial order and employs it to calculates the
possible spatial range of subsequent feature matches, thus filtering out
unnecessary feature matches. We also integrate it with epipolar geometry to
further improve matching efficiency and accuracy. Since the spatial order of
feature points is affected by image rotation, we propose a suitable image
alignment method from the fundamental matrix of epipolar geometry to remove the
effect of image rotation. To verify the feasibility of the proposed method, we
conduct a series of experiments, including a standard benchmark dataset,
self-generated simulated images, and real images. The results demonstrate that
our proposed method is significantly more efficient and has more accurate
feature matching than the traditional method.

Abstract: Gait recognition is an important biometric for human identification at a
distance, particularly under low-resolution or unconstrained environments.
Current works typically focus on either 2D representations (e.g., silhouettes
and skeletons) or 3D representations (e.g., meshes and SMPLs), but relying on a
single modality often fails to capture the full geometric and dynamic
complexity of human walking patterns. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal
and multi-task framework that combines 2D temporal silhouettes with 3D SMPL
features for robust gait analysis. Beyond identification, we introduce a
multitask learning strategy that jointly performs gait recognition and human
attribute estimation, including age, body mass index (BMI), and gender. A
unified transformer is employed to effectively fuse multi-modal gait features
and better learn attribute-related representations, while preserving
discriminative identity cues. Extensive experiments on the large-scale BRIAR
datasets, collected under challenging conditions such as long-range distances
(up to 1 km) and extreme pitch angles (up to 50{\deg}), demonstrate that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in gait recognition and provides
accurate human attribute estimation. These results highlight the promise of
multi-modal and multitask learning for advancing gait-based human understanding
in real-world scenarios.

*Jyotirmay Nag Setu,Kevin Desai,John Quarles*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用迁移学习和LSTM网络从VR游戏视频中预测晕动症严重程度，准确率达到68.4%，优于现有仅基于视频数据的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着VR技术的快速发展，晕动症问题严重阻碍了其广泛应用。现有研究多关注多模态深度学习方法，但基于视频特征的晕动症预测研究较少。

Method: 使用在ImageNet上预训练的InceptionV3模型提取VR游戏视频的高级视觉特征，然后通过LSTM网络捕捉VR体验的时间动态特性，预测晕动症严重程度。

Result: 该方法实现了68.4%的晕动症严重程度分类准确率，超越了仅基于视频数据的现有模型性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为VR开发者提供了评估和减轻晕动症的实际工具，并为基于视频的时间建模研究奠定了基础，有助于提升VR应用的用户舒适度。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of virtual reality (VR) technology, its adoption
across domains such as healthcare, education, and entertainment has grown
significantly. However, the persistent issue of cybersickness, marked by
symptoms resembling motion sickness, continues to hinder widespread acceptance
of VR. While recent research has explored multimodal deep learning approaches
leveraging data from integrated VR sensors like eye and head tracking, there
remains limited investigation into the use of video-based features for
predicting cybersickness. In this study, we address this gap by utilizing
transfer learning to extract high-level visual features from VR gameplay videos
using the InceptionV3 model pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. These features
are then passed to a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture the
temporal dynamics of the VR experience and predict cybersickness severity over
time. Our approach effectively leverages the time-series nature of video data,
achieving a 68.4% classification accuracy for cybersickness severity. This
surpasses the performance of existing models trained solely on video data,
providing a practical tool for VR developers to evaluate and mitigate
cybersickness in virtual environments. Furthermore, this work lays the
foundation for future research on video-based temporal modeling for enhancing
user comfort in VR applications.

*Suyang Xi,Chenxi Yang,Hong Ding,Yiqing Ni,Catherine C. Liu,Yunhao Liu,Chengqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HuLiRAG框架通过"what-where-reweight"级联方法，将多模态推理分阶段处理，使用开放词汇检测定位候选参照物，SAM掩码恢复细粒度空间精度，自适应权衡局部与全局对齐，并通过掩码引导微调将空间证据注入生成过程，显著减少幻觉并提高事实一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉问答中经常产生关于物体身份、位置和关系的幻觉，因为文本查询没有明确锚定到视觉参照物。现有的检索增强生成方法只关注全局图像信息，缺乏局部细节和细粒度交互推理。

Method: 提出HuLiRAG框架，采用三阶段级联：1) 通过开放词汇检测锚定候选参照物(what)；2) 使用SAM掩码进行空间解析恢复细粒度精度(where)；3) 自适应权衡局部与全局对齐(reweight)。通过掩码引导微调将空间证据注入生成过程。

Result: 大量实验表明，这种类人级联方法提高了接地保真度和事实一致性，同时减少了幻觉，推动了多模态问答向可信推理发展。

Conclusion: HuLiRAG通过模拟人类视觉推理过程的分阶段处理，将接地从被动偏置转变为答案制定的显式约束，显著提升了多模态问答的可靠性和准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often fail in fine-grained visual
question answering, producing hallucinations about object identities,
positions, and relations because textual queries are not explicitly anchored to
visual referents. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) alleviates some errors,
but it fails to align with human-like processing at both the retrieval and
augmentation levels. Specifically, it focuses only on global-level image
information but lacks local detail and limits reasoning about fine-grained
interactions. To overcome this limitation, we present Human-Like
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HuLiRAG), a framework that stages multimodal
reasoning as a ``what--where--reweight'' cascade. Queries are first anchored to
candidate referents via open-vocabulary detection (what), then spatially
resolved with SAM-derived masks to recover fine-grained precision (where), and
adaptively prioritized through the trade-off between local and global alignment
(reweight). Mask-guided fine-tuning further injects spatial evidence into the
generation process, transforming grounding from a passive bias into an explicit
constraint on answer formulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this
human-like cascade improves grounding fidelity and factual consistency while
reducing hallucinations, advancing multimodal question answering toward
trustworthy reasoning.

*Kangjian Zhu,Haobo Jiang,Yigong Zhang,Jianjun Qian,Jian Yang,Jin Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonoSE(3)-Diffusion是一个基于单目视觉的SE(3)扩散框架，将无标记的机器人姿态估计建模为条件去噪扩散过程，通过可见性约束的扩散过程增强训练数据多样性，并通过时间步感知的反向过程进行渐进式姿态优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法使用固定尺度的扰动，缺乏多样性且可能超出相机视野。需要一种能够生成视野内多样化训练姿态的方法，提高网络泛化能力。

Method: 包含两个过程：1）可见性约束的扩散过程，逐步扰动真实姿态生成噪声变换；2）时间步感知的反向过程，通过去噪网络迭代预测姿态，并按照粗到细的调度进行姿态优化。

Result: 在两个基准测试（DREAM和RoboKeyGen）上均取得改进，在最具挑战性的数据集上达到66.75的AUC，比现有最优方法提升32.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过扩散模型框架实现了更鲁棒和准确的单目机器人姿态估计，扩散过程增强了训练数据多样性，反向过程的时间步感知优化提高了预测精度。

Abstract: We propose MonoSE(3)-Diffusion, a monocular SE(3) diffusion framework that
formulates markerless, image-based robot pose estimation as a conditional
denoising diffusion process. The framework consists of two processes: a
visibility-constrained diffusion process for diverse pose augmentation and a
timestep-aware reverse process for progressive pose refinement. The diffusion
process progressively perturbs ground-truth poses to noisy transformations for
training a pose denoising network. Importantly, we integrate visibility
constraints into the process, ensuring the transformations remain within the
camera field of view. Compared to the fixed-scale perturbations used in current
methods, the diffusion process generates in-view and diverse training poses,
thereby improving the network generalization capability. Furthermore, the
reverse process iteratively predicts the poses by the denoising network and
refines pose estimates by sampling from the diffusion posterior of current
timestep, following a scheduled coarse-to-fine procedure. Moreover, the
timestep indicates the transformation scales, which guide the denoising network
to achieve more accurate pose predictions. The reverse process demonstrates
higher robustness than direct prediction, benefiting from its timestep-aware
refinement scheme. Our approach demonstrates improvements across two benchmarks
(DREAM and RoboKeyGen), achieving a notable AUC of 66.75 on the most
challenging dataset, representing a 32.3% gain over the state-of-the-art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoDeGraph是一种新的零样本图像异常检测算法，通过识别和过滤一致性异常来解决现有方法在处理重复缺陷时的性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于表示的方法在处理一致性异常（相似缺陷在多个图像中重复出现）时表现不佳，导致异常分类和分割性能下降。

Method: 构建图像级图结构，将图像作为节点，连接具有共享一致性异常模式的图像，利用社区检测过滤这些异常。基于极端值理论提供理论基础。

Result: 在MVTec AD数据集上，使用ViT-L-14-336骨干网络达到98.3% AUROC的异常分类性能，分割性能F1得分66.8%（提升4.2%），AP 68.1%（提升5.4%）。使用DINOv2骨干网络进一步提升分割性能至69.1% F1和71.9% AP。

Conclusion: CoDeGraph算法能有效处理一致性异常问题，在不同骨干网络架构下都表现出鲁棒性，显著提升了零样本异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot image anomaly classification (AC) and segmentation (AS) are vital
for industrial quality control, detecting defects without prior training data.
Existing representation-based methods compare patch features with nearest
neighbors in unlabeled test images but struggle with consistent anomalies --
similar defects recurring across multiple images -- resulting in poor AC/AS
performance. We introduce Consistent-Anomaly Detection Graph (CoDeGraph), a
novel algorithm that identifies and filters consistent anomalies from
similarity computations. Our key insight is that normal patches in industrial
images show stable, gradually increasing similarity to other test images, while
consistent-anomaly patches exhibit abrupt similarity spikes after exhausting a
limited set of similar matches, a phenomenon we term ``neighbor-burnout.''
CoDeGraph constructs an image-level graph, with images as nodes and edges
connecting those with shared consistent-anomaly patterns, using community
detection to filter these anomalies. We provide a theoretical foundation using
Extreme Value Theory to explain the effectiveness of our approach. Experiments
on MVTec AD with the ViT-L-14-336 backbone achieve 98.3% AUROC for AC and AS
performance of 66.8% (+4.2%) F1 and 68.1% (+5.4%) AP over state-of-the-art
zero-shot methods. Using the DINOv2 backbone further improves segmentation,
yielding 69.1% (+6.5%) F1 and 71.9% (+9.2%) AP, demonstrating robustness across
architectures.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的医学图像分割方法，通过模拟临床专家小组的决策过程来处理标注者间的变异性，将专家分歧视为有用信号而非噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割标注存在标注者间变异性问题，传统的平均专家标签方法会丢弃临床不确定性信息，需要更有效地利用专家分歧。

Method: 使用群体决策模拟框架，包括专家签名生成器学习个体标注者风格，以及模拟咨询模块从潜在空间智能采样生成最终分割结果。

Result: 在CBCT和MRI数据集上取得了最先进的结果，Dice分数分别达到92.11%和90.72%。

Conclusion: 通过将专家分歧视为有用信号而非噪声，为构建更稳健和可信的医疗AI系统提供了清晰路径。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation annotation suffers from inter-rater variability
(IRV) due to differences in annotators' expertise and the inherent blurriness
of medical images. Standard approaches that simply average expert labels are
flawed, as they discard the valuable clinical uncertainty revealed in
disagreements. We introduce a fundamentally new approach with our group
decision simulation framework, which works by mimicking the collaborative
decision-making process of a clinical panel. Under this framework, an Expert
Signature Generator (ESG) learns to represent individual annotator styles in a
unique latent space. A Simulated Consultation Module (SCM) then intelligently
generates the final segmentation by sampling from this space. This method
achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging CBCT and MRI datasets (92.11%
and 90.72% Dice scores). By treating expert disagreement as a useful signal
instead of noise, our work provides a clear path toward more robust and
trustworthy AI systems for healthcare.

Motivation: TIPS手术预后结果差异大且常发生肝性脑病，需要准确的术前预后模型。现有方法面临ROI标注耗时、单模态方法可靠性差、单终点预测不全面等挑战，且缺乏公开数据集。

Method: 包含三个核心模块：(1)双选项分割：结合半监督和基础模型实现有限标注下的稳健ROI分割；(2)多模态交互：使用多粒度放射组学注意力、渐进正交解缠和临床引导预后增强实现跨模态特征交互；(3)多任务预测：采用分阶段训练策略同时优化生存、门脉压力梯度和肝性脑病预测。

Result: 在MultiTIPS数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法优于现有最先进方法，具有强大的跨域泛化能力和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法在临床应用中具有良好前景，数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is an established
procedure for portal hypertension, but provides variable survival outcomes and
frequent overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE), indicating the necessity of
accurate preoperative prognostic modeling. Current studies typically build
machine learning models from preoperative CT images or clinical
characteristics, but face three key challenges: (1) labor-intensive
region-of-interest (ROI) annotation, (2) poor reliability and generalizability
of unimodal methods, and (3) incomplete assessment from single-endpoint
prediction. Moreover, the lack of publicly accessible datasets constrains
research in this field. Therefore, we present MultiTIPS, the first public
multi-center dataset for TIPS prognosis, and propose a novel multimodal
prognostic framework based on it. The framework comprises three core modules:
(1) dual-option segmentation, which integrates semi-supervised and foundation
model-based pipelines to achieve robust ROI segmentation with limited
annotations and facilitate subsequent feature extraction; (2) multimodal
interaction, where three techniques, multi-grained radiomics attention (MGRA),
progressive orthogonal disentanglement (POD), and clinically guided prognostic
enhancement (CGPE), are introduced to enable cross-modal feature interaction
and complementary representation integration, thus improving model accuracy and
robustness; and (3) multi-task prediction, where a staged training strategy is
used to perform stable optimization of survival, portal pressure gradient
(PPG), and OHE prediction for comprehensive prognostic assessment. Extensive
experiments on MultiTIPS demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method
over state-of-the-art approaches, along with strong cross-domain generalization
and interpretability, indicating its promise for clinical application. The
dataset and code are available.

TL;DR: 提出Cross-Modal Guidance(CMG)，一种无需训练的推理方法，通过降低视觉-语言注意力来减少VLM的幻觉问题，强调视觉上下文感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型存在严重幻觉问题，倾向于生成与图像无关但语言流畅的响应，主要原因是语言偏见。

Method: 自适应掩码关键图像标记的注意力权重，通过视觉-语言注意力退化来强调视觉上下文感知，无需额外训练。

Result: 在幻觉特定基准测试中显著提升不同VLM性能，有效泛化，无需额外条件或训练成本。

Conclusion: CMG方法能显著减少语言偏见导致的幻觉，同时保持VLM能力，具有优越优势。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown solid ability for multimodal
understanding of both visual and language contexts. However, existing VLMs
often face severe challenges of hallucinations, meaning that VLMs tend to
generate responses that are only fluent in the language but irrelevant to
images in previous contexts. To address this issue, we analyze how language
bias contributes to hallucinations and then introduce Cross-Modal
Guidance(CMG), a training-free decoding method that addresses the
hallucinations by leveraging the difference between the output distributions of
the original model and the one with degraded visual-language attention. In
practice, we adaptively mask the attention weight of the most influential image
tokens in selected transformer layers to corrupt the visual-language perception
as a concrete type of degradation. Such a degradation-induced decoding
emphasizes the perception of visual contexts and therefore significantly
reduces language bias without harming the ability of VLMs. In experiment
sections, we conduct comprehensive studies. All results demonstrate the
superior advantages of CMG with neither additional conditions nor training
costs. We also quantitatively show CMG can improve different VLM's performance
on hallucination-specific benchmarks and generalize effectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有伪图像表示方法在处理非结构化点云时往往忽视点云的结构和语义细节，导致特征融合和判别能力有限，需要开发能更好提取判别性特征的方法。

Method: 1) 全局-局部特征融合编码模块增强局部特征相关性并捕获全局上下文；2) 多分支特征提取网络捕获更多邻域信息并增强轮廓特征判别性；3) 深度特征引导注意力机制提升跨通道特征融合精度。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI和nuScenes验证集上分别达到69.83%和78.65%的准确率，平衡了高性能和实时能力。

Conclusion: DAGLFNet在LiDAR点云语义分割中表现出色，为基于LiDAR的实时应用展示了巨大潜力。

Abstract: Environmental perception systems play a critical role in high-precision
mapping and autonomous navigation, with LiDAR serving as a core sensor that
provides accurate 3D point cloud data. How to efficiently process unstructured
point clouds while extracting structured semantic information remains a
significant challenge, and in recent years, numerous pseudo-image-based
representation methods have emerged to achieve a balance between efficiency and
performance. However, they often overlook the structural and semantic details
of point clouds, resulting in limited feature fusion and discriminability. In
this work, we propose DAGLFNet, a pseudo-image-based semantic segmentation
framework designed to extract discriminative features. First, the Global-Local
Feature Fusion Encoding module is used to enhance the correlation among local
features within a set and capture global contextual information. Second, the
Multi-Branch Feature Extraction network is employed to capture more
neighborhood information and enhance the discriminability of contour features.
Finally, a Feature Fusion via Deep Feature-guided Attention mechanism is
introduced to improve the precision of cross-channel feature fusion.
Experimental evaluations show that DAGLFNet achieves 69.83\% and 78.65\% on the
validation sets of SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, respectively. The method
balances high performance with real-time capability, demonstrating great
potential for LiDAR-based real-time applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MSF-Mamba模型，通过运动感知状态融合模块增强Mamba的局部时空建模能力，解决微手势识别中长程依赖和局部模式捕获的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微手势识别需要同时建模长程和局部时空依赖。CNN擅长局部模式但长程依赖有限，Transformer能处理长程依赖但计算成本高，Mamba虽然高效但缺乏局部时空建模能力。

Method: 提出MSF-Mamba模型，基于中心帧差设计运动感知状态融合模块，融合局部上下文相邻状态。还提出多尺度版本MSF-Mamba+，支持多尺度运动感知状态融合和自适应尺度加权。

Result: 在两个公开微手势识别数据集上的实验表明，轻量级MSF-Mamba版本即达到最先进性能，优于现有CNN、Transformer和SSM模型，同时保持高效率。

Conclusion: MSF-Mamba通过运动感知局部时空建模有效解决了Mamba在微手势识别中的局限性，能够准确捕捉细微运动线索，在性能和效率上均表现优异。

Abstract: Micro-gesture recognition (MGR) targets the identification of subtle and
fine-grained human motions and requires accurate modeling of both long-range
and local spatiotemporal dependencies. While CNNs are effective at capturing
local patterns, they struggle with long-range dependencies due to their limited
receptive fields. Transformer-based models address this limitation through
self-attention mechanisms but suffer from high computational costs. Recently,
Mamba has shown promise as an efficient model, leveraging state space models
(SSMs) to enable linear-time processing However, directly applying the vanilla
Mamba to MGR may not be optimal. This is because Mamba processes inputs as 1D
sequences, with state updates relying solely on the previous state, and thus
lacks the ability to model local spatiotemporal dependencies. In addition,
previous methods lack a design of motion-awareness, which is crucial in MGR. To
overcome these limitations, we propose motion-aware state fusion mamba
(MSF-Mamba), which enhances Mamba with local spatiotemporal modeling by fusing
local contextual neighboring states. Our design introduces a motion-aware state
fusion module based on central frame difference (CFD). Furthermore, a
multiscale version named MSF-Mamba+ has been proposed. Specifically, MSF-Mamba
supports multiscale motion-aware state fusion, as well as an adaptive scale
weighting module that dynamically weighs the fused states across different
scales. These enhancements explicitly address the limitations of vanilla Mamba
by enabling motion-aware local spatiotemporal modeling, allowing MSF-Mamba and
MSF-Mamba to effectively capture subtle motion cues for MGR. Experiments on two
public MGR datasets demonstrate that even the lightweight version, namely,
MSF-Mamba, achieves SoTA performance, outperforming existing CNN-,
Transformer-, and SSM-based models while maintaining high efficiency.

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型具有内在的自优化能力，这一发现可为未来研究提供启示，推动对VLM学习机制的深入探索。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) integrate visual knowledge with the analytical
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through supervised visual
instruction tuning, using image-question-answer triplets. However, the
potential of VLMs trained without supervised instruction remains largely
unexplored. This study validates that VLMs possess inherent self-refinement
capabilities, enabling them to generate high-quality supervised data without
external inputs and thereby learn autonomously. Specifically, to stimulate the
self-refinement ability of VLMs, we propose a self-refinement framework based
on a Triangular Consistency principle: within the image-query-answer triangle,
any masked elements should be consistently and accurately reconstructed. The
framework involves three steps: (1) We enable the instruction generation
ability of VLMs by adding multi-task instruction tuning like
image$\rightarrow$question-answer or image-answer$\rightarrow$question. (2) We
generate image-query-answer triplets from unlabeled images and use the
Triangular Consistency principle for filtering. (3) The model is further
updated using the filtered synthetic data. To investigate the underlying
mechanisms behind this self-refinement capability, we conduct a theoretical
analysis from a causal perspective. Using the widely recognized LLaVA-1.5 as
our baseline, our experiments reveal that the model can autonomously achieve
consistent, though deliberately modest, improvements across multiple benchmarks
without any external supervision, such as human annotations or environmental
feedback. We expect that the insights of this study on the self-refinement
ability of VLMs can inspire future research on the learning mechanism of VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的多维RoPE在图像生成中存在三个关键限制：刚性频率分配、轴间独立性和统一的头处理方式，无法有效捕捉细粒度图像生成所需的复杂结构偏置。

Method: 在旋转映射前插入一个通过奇异值分解参数化的可学习线性变换，实现动态频率重分配、旋转平面语义对齐和头特定的位置感受野，同时严格保持RoPE的相对位置属性。

Conclusion: HARoPE可作为有效的即插即用替代方案，为基于Transformer的图像生成模型提供原则性和适应性强的位置感知增强解决方案。

Abstract: Transformers rely on explicit positional encoding to model structure in data.
While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) excels in 1D domains, its application to
image generation reveals significant limitations such as fine-grained spatial
relation modeling, color cues, and object counting. This paper identifies key
limitations of standard multi-dimensional RoPE-rigid frequency allocation,
axis-wise independence, and uniform head treatment-in capturing the complex
structural biases required for fine-grained image generation. We propose
HARoPE, a head-wise adaptive extension that inserts a learnable linear
transformation parameterized via singular value decomposition (SVD) before the
rotary mapping. This lightweight modification enables dynamic frequency
reallocation, semantic alignment of rotary planes, and head-specific positional
receptive fields while rigorously preserving RoPE's relative-position property.
Extensive experiments on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image
generation (Flux and MMDiT) demonstrate that HARoPE consistently improves
performance over strong RoPE baselines and other extensions. The method serves
as an effective drop-in replacement, offering a principled and adaptable
solution for enhancing positional awareness in transformer-based image
generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖直接参考风格注入或2D扩散模型，存在每场景优化成本高、风格与语义内容纠缠的问题。

Method: 使用拼图操作（空间打乱和随机掩码参考图像块）抑制对象语义并分离风格统计特征，通过参考到视角的交叉注意力将风格线索集成到多视角扩散模型中。

Result: 在标准3D风格化基准测试中，Jigsaw3D实现了高风格保真度和多视角一致性，延迟显著降低，并能泛化到部分参考风格化、多对象场景风格化和可平铺纹理生成。

Conclusion: Jigsaw3D提供了一种有效解耦风格与内容的方法，实现了快速且视角一致的3D风格迁移。

Abstract: Controllable 3D style transfer seeks to restyle a 3D asset so that its
textures match a reference image while preserving the integrity and multi-view
consistency. The prevalent methods either rely on direct reference style token
injection or score-distillation from 2D diffusion models, which incurs heavy
per-scene optimization and often entangles style with semantic content. We
introduce Jigsaw3D, a multi-view diffusion based pipeline that decouples style
from content and enables fast, view-consistent stylization. Our key idea is to
leverage the jigsaw operation - spatial shuffling and random masking of
reference patches - to suppress object semantics and isolate stylistic
statistics (color palettes, strokes, textures). We integrate these style cues
into a multi-view diffusion model via reference-to-view cross-attention,
producing view-consistent stylized renderings conditioned on the input mesh.
The renders are then style-baked onto the surface to yield seamless textures.
Across standard 3D stylization benchmarks, Jigsaw3D achieves high style
fidelity and multi-view consistency with substantially lower latency, and

TL;DR: 提出了VideoReward Thinker (VR-Thinker)框架，通过视觉推理操作和可配置视觉记忆窗口，解决多模态奖励模型中视觉输入消耗大上下文预算和推理过程中幻觉与遗忘的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态奖励模型存在两个主要限制：视觉输入消耗大量上下文预算导致细节丢失，以及所有视觉信息打包到初始提示中加剧了推理过程中的幻觉和遗忘问题。

Method: 采用强化微调流程：1) 冷启动使用精心策划的视觉思维链数据；2) 对高质量样本进行拒绝采样微调；3) 应用组相对策略优化来增强推理能力。

Result: 在视频偏好基准测试中达到最先进准确率，特别是在长视频上：7B VR-Thinker在VideoGen Reward上达到80.5%，在GenAI-Bench上达到82.3%，在MJ-Bench-Video上达到75.6%。

Conclusion: 验证了基于图像思考的多模态奖励建模方法的有效性和前景。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal reward models (RMs) have substantially
improved post-training for visual generative models. However, current RMs face
inherent limitations: (1) visual inputs consume large context budgets, forcing
fewer frames and causing loss of fine-grained details; and (2) all visual
information is packed into the initial prompt, exacerbating hallucination and
forgetting during chain-of-thought reasoning. To overcome these issues, we
introduce VideoReward Thinker (VR-Thinker), a thinking-with-image framework
that equips the RM with visual reasoning operations (e.g., select frame) and a
configurable visual memory window. This allows the RM to actively acquire and
update visual evidence within context limits, improving reasoning fidelity and
reliability. We activate visual reasoning via a reinforcement fine-tuning
pipeline: (i) Cold Start with curated visual chain-of-thought data to distill
basic reasoning skills and operation formatting; (ii) select samples whose
per-dimension and overall judgments are all correct, then conduct Rejection
sampling Fine-Tuning on these high-quality traces to further enhance reasoning;
and (iii) apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen
reasoning. Our approach delivers state-of-the-art accuracy among open-source
models on video preference benchmarks, especially for longer videos: a 7B
VR-Thinker achieves 80.5% on VideoGen Reward, 82.3% on GenAI-Bench, and 75.6%
on MJ-Bench-Video. These results validate the effectiveness and promise of
thinking-with-image multimodal reward modeling.

*Xi Zhang,Xiaolin Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种扩展CNN感受野的LUT方法，通过自适应量化、不规则空洞卷积和U型级联结构，在固定表格大小下提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LUT方法由于表格大小组合爆炸问题，卷积核感受野受限，限制了CNN推理性能。

Method: 学习最优格点向量量化器自适应分配量化分辨率；采用不规则空洞卷积和U型级联LUT结构捕获多级上下文信息。

Result: 在保持相同空间复杂度下，显著提升了LUT驱动的快速CNN推理性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了速度、精度和内存效率，相比现有LUT方法有显著改进。

Abstract: Recently, several look-up table (LUT) methods were developed to greatly
expedite the inference of CNNs in a classical strategy of trading space for
speed. However, these LUT methods suffer from a common drawback of limited
receptive field of the convolution kernels due to the combinatorial explosion
of table size. This research aims to expand the CNN receptive field with a
fixed table size, thereby enhancing the performance of LUT-driven fast CNN
inference while maintaining the same space complexity. To achieve this goal,
various techniques are proposed. The main contribution is a novel approach of
learning an optimal lattice vector quantizer that adaptively allocates the
quantization resolution across data dimensions based on their significance to
the inference task. In addition, the lattice vector quantizer offers an
inherently more accurate approximation of CNN kernels than scalar quantizer as
used in current practice. Furthermore, we introduce other receptive field
expansion strategies, including irregular dilated convolutions and a U-shaped
cascaded LUT structure, designed to capture multi-level contextual information
without inflating table size. Together, these innovations allow our approach to
effectively balance speed, accuracy, and memory efficiency, demonstrating
significant improvements over existing LUT methods.

Conclusion: COSINE成功统一了开放词汇分割和上下文分割，通过多模态提示的协同作用实现了更好的分割性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: In this work, we present COSINE, a unified open-world segmentation model that
consolidates open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context segmentation with
multi-modal prompts (e.g., text and image). COSINE exploits foundation models
to extract representations for an input image and corresponding multi-modal
prompts, and a SegDecoder to align these representations, model their
interaction, and obtain masks specified by input prompts across different
granularities. In this way, COSINE overcomes architectural discrepancies,
divergent learning objectives, and distinct representation learning strategies
of previous pipelines for open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context
segmentation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that COSINE has significant
performance improvements in both open-vocabulary and in-context segmentation
tasks. Our exploratory analyses highlight that the synergistic collaboration
between using visual and textual prompts leads to significantly improved
generalization over single-modality approaches.

Conclusion: 通过在识别阶段嵌入模式分析，将计算机视觉与语言建模相结合，为智能交通和监控应用提供了更强的适应性。

Abstract: This work presents a pattern-aware framework for automatic license plate
recognition (ALPR), designed to operate reliably across diverse plate layouts
and challenging real-world conditions. The proposed system consists of a
modern, high-precision detection network followed by a recognition stage that
integrates a transformer-based vision model with an iterative language
modelling mechanism. This unified recognition stage performs character
identification and post-OCR refinement in a seamless process, learning the
structural patterns and formatting rules specific to license plates without
relying on explicit heuristic corrections or manual layout classification.
Through this design, the system jointly optimizes visual and linguistic cues,
enables iterative refinement to improve OCR accuracy under noise, distortion,
and unconventional fonts, and achieves layout-independent recognition across
multiple international datasets (IR-LPR, UFPR-ALPR, AOLP). Experimental results
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to recent
segmentation-free approaches, highlighting how embedding pattern analysis
within the recognition stage bridges computer vision and language modelling for
enhanced adaptability in intelligent transportation and surveillance
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中缺失模态的不平衡问题导致恶性循环：缺失率高的模态更新次数少，学习进度不一致，特征表示退化，进一步降低其贡献

Method: MCE包含两个协同组件：学习能力增强(LCE)通过多级因素动态平衡模态特定学习进度；表示能力增强(RCE)通过子集预测和跨模态补全任务提升特征语义和鲁棒性

Result: 在四个多模态基准测试上的综合评估表明，MCE在各种缺失配置下始终优于最先进方法

Conclusion: MCE有效解决了多模态学习中缺失模态的不平衡问题，通过动态平衡学习进度和增强特征表示实现了更好的性能

Abstract: Multi-modal learning has made significant advances across diverse pattern
recognition applications. However, handling missing modalities, especially
under imbalanced missing rates, remains a major challenge. This imbalance
triggers a vicious cycle: modalities with higher missing rates receive fewer
updates, leading to inconsistent learning progress and representational
degradation that further diminishes their contribution. Existing methods
typically focus on global dataset-level balancing, often overlooking critical
sample-level variations in modality utility and the underlying issue of
degraded feature quality. We propose Modality Capability Enhancement (MCE) to
tackle these limitations. MCE includes two synergistic components: i) Learning
Capability Enhancement (LCE), which introduces multi-level factors to
dynamically balance modality-specific learning progress, and ii) Representation
Capability Enhancement (RCE), which improves feature semantics and robustness
through subset prediction and cross-modal completion tasks. Comprehensive
evaluations on four multi-modal benchmarks show that MCE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods under various missing configurations. The
journal preprint version is now available at

Motivation: 冰川湖溃决洪水是高山地区罕见但具有破坏性的灾害，现有研究受限于碎片化和单模态数据，缺乏能够结合视觉指标与物理前兆的统一数据集来进行预测。

Method: 整合三种互补数据源：Sentinel-2多光谱影像用于空间监测，NASA ITS_LIVE速度产品用于冰川运动学，MODIS地表温度记录跨越二十多年。预处理包括云掩蔽、质量过滤、归一化、时间插值、数据增强和周期性编码，随后进行多模态数据协调。

Conclusion: 通过解决类别不平衡、云污染和粗分辨率等挑战，GLOFNet为基准测试多模态深度学习方法在罕见灾害预测中的应用提供了结构化基础。

Abstract: Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) are rare but destructive hazards in high
mountain regions, yet predictive research is hindered by fragmented and
unimodal data. Most prior efforts emphasize post-event mapping, whereas
forecasting requires harmonized datasets that combine visual indicators with
physical precursors. We present GLOFNet, a multimodal dataset for GLOF
monitoring and prediction, focused on the Shisper Glacier in the Karakoram. It
integrates three complementary sources: Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery for
spatial monitoring, NASA ITS_LIVE velocity products for glacier kinematics, and
MODIS Land Surface Temperature records spanning over two decades. Preprocessing
included cloud masking, quality filtering, normalization, temporal
interpolation, augmentation, and cyclical encoding, followed by harmonization
across modalities. Exploratory analysis reveals seasonal glacier velocity
cycles, long-term warming of ~0.8 K per decade, and spatial heterogeneity in
cryospheric conditions. The resulting dataset, GLOFNet, is publicly available
to support future research in glacial hazard prediction. By addressing
challenges such as class imbalance, cloud contamination, and coarse resolution,
GLOFNet provides a structured foundation for benchmarking multimodal deep
learning approaches to rare hazard prediction.

Abstract: Aiming at the problems of missed detection, false detection and low detection
efficiency in transmission line foreign object detection under railway
environment, we proposed an improved algorithm MRS-YOLO based on YOLO11.
Firstly, a multi-scale Adaptive Kernel Depth Feature Fusion (MAKDF) module is
proposed and fused with the C3k2 module to form C3k2_MAKDF, which enhances the
model's feature extraction capability for foreign objects of different sizes
and shapes. Secondly, a novel Re-calibration Feature Fusion Pyramid Network
(RCFPN) is designed as a neck structure to enhance the model's ability to
integrate and utilize multi-level features effectively. Then, Spatial and
Channel Reconstruction Detect Head (SC_Detect) based on spatial and channel
preprocessing is designed to enhance the model's overall detection performance.
Finally, the channel pruning technique is used to reduce the redundancy of the
improved model, drastically reduce Parameters and Giga Floating Point

Abstract: Weed species classification represents an important step for the development
of automated targeting systems that allow the adoption of precision agriculture
practices. To reduce costs and yield losses caused by their presence. The
identification of weeds is a challenging problem due to their shared
similarities with crop plants and the variability related to the differences in
terms of their types. Along with the variations in relation to changes in field
conditions. Moreover, to fully benefit from deep learning-based methods, large
fully annotated datasets are needed. This requires time intensive and laborious
process for data labeling, which represents a limitation in agricultural
applications. Hence, for the aim of improving the utilization of the unlabeled
data, regarding conditions of scarcity in terms of the labeled data available
during the learning phase and provide robust and high classification
performance. We propose a deep semi-supervised approach, that combines
consistency regularization with similarity learning. Through our developed deep

inference in noisy conditions demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of
our method in comparison to state-of-the-art fully supervised deep learning

Motivation: 现有分词器在视觉理解和生成之间存在性能权衡，因为高层语义抽象与低层像素重建存在内在冲突。需要开发一个能同时兼顾两者的统一分词器。

Conclusion: UniFlow通过创新的自适应自蒸馏和像素流解码器设计，成功解决了视觉理解和生成之间的性能权衡问题，实现了统一建模的双赢效果。

Abstract: Tokenizer is a crucial component for both visual understanding and
generation. To advance toward the ultimate goal of universal modeling, recent
research has focused on developing a unified tokenizer. However, existing
tokenizers face a significant performance trade-off between understanding and
generation, stemming from the inherent conflict between high-level semantic
abstraction and low-level pixel reconstruction. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a generic and unified tokenizer, namely UniFlow, by flexibly adapting
any visual encoder with a concise reconstruction decoder. Specifically, we
introduce layer-wise adaptive self-distillation applied to the well-pretrained
visual encoders, which enables UniFlow to simultaneously inherit the strong
semantic features for visual understanding and flexibly adapt to model
fine-grained details for visual generation. Moreover, we propose a lightweight
patch-wise pixel flow decoder, which efficiently achieves high-fidelity pixel
reconstruction by modeling a conditional flow from the noisy state back to the
patch-wise pixel domain. By leveraging the semantic features as visual
conditions for the decoder, we effectively alleviate the training conflicts
between understanding and generation. Furthermore, the patch-wise learning
strategy simplifies the data distribution, thereby improving training
efficiency. Extensive experiments across 13 challenging benchmarks spanning 7
widely studied visual understanding and generation tasks demonstrate that
UniFlow achieves a win-win outcome. For instance, our 7B UniFlow-XL not only
surpasses the 14B TokenFlow-XL by 7.75% on average understanding benchmarks,
but also achieves competitive results in both visual reconstruction and
generation, surpassing UniTok by 0.15 in rFID and 0.09 in gFID (without
guidance), respectively.

Motivation: 传统光流估计在高速和低光场景中面临运动模糊和光照不足的问题，导致纹理减弱、噪声放大，影响外观饱和度和边界完整性。事件相机虽然外观稀疏但边界完整，传统融合方法未能有效解决外观特征退化问题。

Method: 采用扩散模型学习从噪声流到清晰流的映射，结合帧相机的外观饱和度和事件相机的边界完整性进行融合。

Result: 该方法不受退化视觉特征影响，能够有效处理高速和低光场景下的光流估计问题。

Conclusion: 基于扩散模型的帧-事件外观-边界融合框架为退化场景下的光流估计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Optical flow estimation has achieved promising results in conventional scenes
but faces challenges in high-speed and low-light scenes, which suffer from
motion blur and insufficient illumination. These conditions lead to weakened
texture and amplified noise and deteriorate the appearance saturation and
boundary completeness of frame cameras, which are necessary for motion feature
matching. In degraded scenes, the frame camera provides dense appearance
saturation but sparse boundary completeness due to its long imaging time and
low dynamic range. In contrast, the event camera offers sparse appearance
saturation, while its short imaging time and high dynamic range gives rise to
dense boundary completeness. Traditionally, existing methods utilize feature
fusion or domain adaptation to introduce event to improve boundary
completeness. However, the appearance features are still deteriorated, which
severely affects the mostly adopted discriminative models that learn the
mapping from visual features to motion fields and generative models that
generate motion fields based on given visual features. So we introduce
diffusion models that learn the mapping from noising flow to clear flow, which
is not affected by the deteriorated visual features. Therefore, we propose a
novel optical flow estimation framework Diff-ABFlow based on diffusion models
with frame-event appearance-boundary fusion.

Motivation: 探索预训练视觉基础模型在OOD检测任务中的潜力，发现现有方法在大语义空间场景下性能不足的问题。

Method: 使用DINOv2等预训练模型进行OOD检测；提出MoFE模块分割特征子空间；引入Dynamic-β Mixup策略自适应调整类别学习难度。

Conclusion: 预训练视觉基础模型是OOD检测的有效工具，结合MoFE和Dynamic-β Mixup可解决大语义空间下的性能瓶颈。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision foundation models have transformed many computer vision
tasks. Despite their strong ability to learn discriminative and generalizable
features crucial for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, their impact on this
task remains underexplored. Motivated by this gap, we systematically
investigate representative vision foundation models for OOD detection. Our
findings reveal that a pre-trained DINOv2 model, even without fine-tuning on
in-domain (ID) data, naturally provides a highly discriminative feature space
for OOD detection, achieving performance comparable to existing
state-of-the-art methods without requiring complex designs. Beyond this, we
explore how fine-tuning foundation models on in-domain (ID) data can enhance
OOD detection. However, we observe that the performance of vision foundation
models remains unsatisfactory in scenarios with a large semantic space. This is
due to the increased complexity of decision boundaries as the number of
categories grows, which complicates the optimization process. To mitigate this,
we propose the Mixture of Feature Experts (MoFE) module, which partitions
features into subspaces, effectively capturing complex data distributions and
refining decision boundaries. Further, we introduce a Dynamic-$\beta$ Mixup
strategy, which samples interpolation weights from a dynamic beta distribution.
This adapts to varying levels of learning difficulty across categories,
improving feature learning for more challenging categories. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, significantly
outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: FSVG提供了一种简单有效的视觉定位基线方法，通过特征选择机制显著降低了计算成本，同时保持了良好的性能。

Abstract: Visual grounding aims to predict the locations of target objects specified by
textual descriptions. For this task with linguistic and visual modalities,
there is a latest research line that focuses on only selecting the
linguistic-relevant visual regions for object localization to reduce the
computational overhead. Albeit achieving impressive performance, it is
iteratively performed on different image scales, and at every iteration,
linguistic features and visual features need to be stored in a cache, incurring
extra overhead. To facilitate the implementation, in this paper, we propose a
feature selection-based simple yet effective baseline for visual grounding,
called FSVG. Specifically, we directly encapsulate the linguistic and visual
modalities into an overall network architecture without complicated iterative
procedures, and utilize the language in parallel as guidance to facilitate the
interaction between linguistic modal and visual modal for extracting effective
visual features. Furthermore, to reduce the computational cost, during the
visual feature learning, we introduce a similarity-based feature selection
mechanism to only exploit language-related visual features for faster
prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets
comprehensively substantiate that the proposed FSVG achieves a better balance
between accuracy and efficiency beyond the current state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 传统后训练方法中，SFT性能次优，RLVR在处理超出模型内部知识库的任务时表现不佳。需要一种能结合两者优势的统一方法。

Method: 提出ViSurf范式，分析推导SFT和RLVR目标以建立统一目标，在RLVR rollout中注入真实标签，并引入三种新的奖励控制策略来稳定和优化训练过程。

Result: 在多个不同基准测试上的广泛实验表明，ViSurf优于单独的SFT、RLVR以及两阶段的SFT→RLVR方法。

Conclusion: 深入分析验证了ViSurf的推导和设计原则，证明了这种统一后训练范式的有效性。

Abstract: Typical post-training paradigms for Large Vision-and-Language Models (LVLMs)
include Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR). SFT leverages external guidance to inject new knowledge,
whereas RLVR utilizes internal reinforcement to enhance reasoning capabilities
and overall performance. However, our analysis reveals that SFT often leads to
sub-optimal performance, while RLVR struggles with tasks that exceed the
model's internal knowledge base. To address these limitations, we propose
ViSurf (\textbf{Vi}sual \textbf{Su}pervised-and-\textbf{R}einforcement
\textbf{F}ine-Tuning), a unified post-training paradigm that integrates the
strengths of both SFT and RLVR within a single stage. We analyze the derivation
of the SFT and RLVR objectives to establish the ViSurf objective, providing a
unified perspective on these two paradigms. The core of ViSurf involves
injecting ground-truth labels into the RLVR rollouts, thereby providing
simultaneous external supervision and internal reinforcement. Furthermore, we
introduce three novel reward control strategies to stabilize and optimize the
training process. Extensive experiments across several diverse benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of ViSurf, outperforming both individual SFT,
RLVR, and two-stage SFT \textrightarrow RLVR. In-depth analysis corroborates
these findings, validating the derivation and design principles of ViSurf.

TL;DR: 提出了OmniQuality-R统一奖励建模框架，将多任务质量推理转化为连续可解释的奖励信号，用于策略优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉评估方法通常局限于单一任务，需要解决多任务质量评估的统一框架问题。

Method: 构建推理增强的奖励建模数据集，通过拒绝采样获取信息丰富的规划-推理轨迹，形成可靠的思维链数据集用于监督微调。采用GRPO进行后训练，使用基于高斯的奖励支持连续分数预测，并加入标准差过滤和熵门控机制来稳定训练。

Result: 在三个关键IQA任务上进行了评估：美学质量评估、技术质量评估和图文对齐。

Conclusion: OmniQuality-R框架能够有效处理多任务质量推理，为策略优化提供连续可解释的奖励信号。

Abstract: Current visual evaluation approaches are typically constrained to a single
task. To address this, we propose OmniQuality-R, a unified reward modeling
framework that transforms multi-task quality reasoning into continuous and
interpretable reward signals for policy optimization. Inspired by subjective
experiments, where participants are given task-specific instructions outlining
distinct assessment principles prior to evaluation, we propose OmniQuality-R, a
structured reward modeling framework that transforms multi-dimensional
reasoning into continuous and interpretable reward signals. To enable this, we
construct a reasoning-enhanced reward modeling dataset by sampling informative
plan-reason trajectories via rejection sampling, forming a reliable
chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Building on
this, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for post-training,
using a Gaussian-based reward to support continuous score prediction. To
further stabilize the training and improve downstream generalization, we
incorporate standard deviation (STD) filtering and entropy gating mechanisms
during reinforcement learning. These techniques suppress unstable updates and
reduce variance in policy optimization. We evaluate OmniQuality-R on three key
IQA tasks: aesthetic quality assessment, technical quality evaluation, and
text-image alignment.

Motivation: 现有线性注意力模型因低秩投影结构和过度均匀的注意力分布导致表达能力下降，限制了节点分类能力。

Result: 在同类性和异类性图基准测试中取得有竞争力的性能，同时保持线性注意力的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该混合框架有效增强了线性注意力的表达能力和分类性能，解决了现有线性注意力模型的局限性。

Abstract: Linear attention mechanisms have emerged as efficient alternatives to full
self-attention in Graph Transformers, offering linear time complexity. However,
existing linear attention models often suffer from a significant drop in
expressiveness due to low-rank projection structures and overly uniform
attention distributions. We theoretically prove that these properties reduce
the class separability of node representations, limiting the model's
classification ability. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid framework
that enhances both the rank and focus of attention. Specifically, we enhance
linear attention by attaching a gated local graph network branch to the value
matrix, thereby increasing the rank of the resulting attention map.
Furthermore, to alleviate the excessive smoothing effect inherent in linear
attention, we introduce a learnable log-power function into the attention
scores to reduce entropy and sharpen focus. We theoretically show that this
function decreases entropy in the attention distribution, enhancing the
separability of learned embeddings. Extensive experiments on both homophilic
and heterophilic graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance while preserving the scalability of linear attention.

Conclusion: 将细粒度运动解耦与基于流的生成建模相结合，为可控说话头视频合成提供了一个强大的新范式。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking-head generation has advanced rapidly with
diffusion-based generative models, yet producing temporally coherent videos
with fine-grained motion control remains challenging. We propose DEMO, a
flow-matching generative framework for audio-driven talking-portrait video
synthesis that delivers disentangled, high-fidelity control of lip motion, head
pose, and eye gaze. The core contribution is a motion auto-encoder that builds
a structured latent space in which motion factors are independently represented
and approximately orthogonalized. On this disentangled motion space, we apply
optimal-transport-based flow matching with a transformer predictor to generate
temporally smooth motion trajectories conditioned on audio. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks show that DEMO outperforms prior methods
in video realism, lip-audio synchronization, and motion fidelity. These results
demonstrate that combining fine-grained motion disentanglement with flow-based
generative modeling provides a powerful new paradigm for controllable
talking-head video synthesis.

Motivation: 传统基于示例的角点案例分类方法不可扩展且缺乏数据覆盖视角，无法适应机器学习模型的泛化需求，需要从数据分布角度重新定义角点案例。

Method: 提出基于数据分布的机器学习框架，将角点案例识别视为分布外检测问题，扩展了标准基准并引入了新的雾增强Lost & Found数据集。

Abstract: For high-stakes applications, like autonomous driving, a safe operation is
necessary to prevent harm, accidents, and failures. Traditionally, difficult
scenarios have been categorized into corner cases and addressed individually.
However, this example-based categorization is not scalable and lacks a data
coverage perspective, neglecting the generalization to training data of machine
learning models. In our work, we propose a novel machine learning approach that
takes the underlying data distribution into account. Based on our novel
perspective, we present a framework for effective corner case recognition for
perception on individual samples. In our evaluation, we show that our approach
(i) unifies existing scenario-based corner case taxonomies under a
distributional perspective, (ii) achieves strong performance on corner case
detection tasks across standard benchmarks for which we extend established
out-of-distribution detection benchmarks, and (iii) enables analysis of
combined corner cases via a newly introduced fog-augmented Lost & Found
dataset. These results provide a principled basis for corner case recognition,
underlining our manual specification-free definition.

Method: 提出了多维度稳定性评估框架，包含存在稳定性、定位稳定性和形状稳定性三个维度，并集成为统一的平均稳定性评分(mAS)。

Conclusion: 时间稳定性应与准确性一起作为核心评估标准，该工作将促进更可靠自动驾驶系统的发展，并发布了公开基准。

Abstract: As one of the fundamental modules in autonomous driving, online
high-definition (HD) maps have attracted significant attention due to their
cost-effectiveness and real-time capabilities. Since vehicles always cruise in
highly dynamic environments, spatial displacement of onboard sensors inevitably
causes shifts in real-time HD mapping results, and such instability poses
fundamental challenges for downstream tasks. However, existing online map
construction models tend to prioritize improving each frame's mapping accuracy,
while the mapping stability has not yet been systematically studied. To fill
this gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
the temporal stability of online HD mapping models. We propose a
multi-dimensional stability evaluation framework with novel metrics for
Presence, Localization, and Shape Stability, integrated into a unified mean
Average Stability (mAS) score. Extensive experiments on 42 models and variants
show that accuracy (mAP) and stability (mAS) represent largely independent
performance dimensions. We further analyze the impact of key model design
choices on both criteria, identifying architectural and training factors that
contribute to high accuracy, high stability, or both. To encourage broader
focus on stability, we will release a public benchmark. Our work highlights the
importance of treating temporal stability as a core evaluation criterion
alongside accuracy, advancing the development of more reliable autonomous
driving systems. The benchmark toolkit, code, and models will be available at
https://stablehdmap.github.io/.

Abstract: With abundant, unlabeled real faces, how can we learn robust and transferable
facial representations to boost generalization across various face security
tasks? We make the first attempt and propose FS-VFM, a scalable self-supervised
pre-training framework, to learn fundamental representations of real face
images. We introduce three learning objectives, namely 3C, that synergize
masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID), empowering FS-VFM
to encode both local patterns and global semantics of real faces. Specifically,
we formulate various facial masking strategies for MIM and devise a simple yet
effective CRFR-P masking, which explicitly prompts the model to pursue
meaningful intra-region Consistency and challenging inter-region Coherency. We
present a reliable self-distillation mechanism that seamlessly couples MIM with
ID to establish underlying local-to-global Correspondence. After pre-training,
vanilla vision transformers (ViTs) serve as universal Vision Foundation Models
for downstream Face Security tasks: cross-dataset deepfake detection,
cross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen diffusion facial forensics. To
efficiently transfer the pre-trained FS-VFM, we further propose FS-Adapter, a
lightweight plug-and-play bottleneck atop the frozen backbone with a novel
real-anchor contrastive objective. Extensive experiments on 11 public
benchmarks demonstrate that our FS-VFM consistently generalizes better than
diverse VFMs, spanning natural and facial domains, fully, weakly, and
self-supervised paradigms, small, base, and large ViT scales, and even
outperforms SOTA task-specific methods, while FS-Adapter offers an excellent
efficiency-performance trade-off. The code and models are available on

Conclusion: 这项工作在一定程度上证明了视频生成模型在真实世界4D交互方面的潜力。

Abstract: Recent Text-to-Video (T2V) models have demonstrated powerful capability in
visual simulation of real-world geometry and physical laws, indicating its
potential as implicit world models. Inspired by this, we explore the
feasibility of leveraging the video generation prior for viewpoint planning
from given 4D scenes, since videos internally accompany dynamic scenes with
natural viewpoints. To this end, we propose a two-stage paradigm to adapt
pre-trained T2V models for viewpoint prediction, in a compatible manner. First,
we inject the 4D scene representation into the pre-trained T2V model via an
adaptive learning branch, where the 4D scene is viewpoint-agnostic and the
conditional generated video embeds the viewpoints visually. Then, we formulate
viewpoint extraction as a hybrid-condition guided camera extrinsic denoising
process. Specifically, a camera extrinsic diffusion branch is further
introduced onto the pre-trained T2V model, by taking the generated video and 4D
scene as input. Experimental results show the superiority of our proposed
method over existing competitors, and ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of our key technical designs. To some extent, this work proves
the potential of video generation models toward 4D interaction in real world.

Abstract: Image-Language Foundation Models (ILFM) have demonstrated remarkable success
in image-text understanding/generation tasks, providing transferable multimodal
representations that generalize across diverse downstream image-based tasks.
The advancement of video-text research has spurred growing interest in
extending image-based models to the video domain. This paradigm, known as
image-to-video transfer learning, succeeds in alleviating the substantial data
and computational requirements associated with training video-language
foundation models from scratch for video-text learning. This survey provides
the first comprehensive review of this emerging field, which begins by
summarizing the widely used ILFM and their capabilities. We then systematically
classify existing image-to-video transfer learning strategies into two
categories: frozen features and modified features, depending on whether the
original representations from ILFM are preserved or undergo modifications.
Building upon the task-specific nature of image-to-video transfer, this survey
methodically elaborates these strategies and details their applications across
a spectrum of video-text learning tasks, ranging from fine-grained (e.g.,
spatio-temporal video grounding) to coarse-grained (e.g., video question
answering). We further present a detailed experimental analysis to investigate
the efficacy of different image-to-video transfer learning paradigms on a range
of downstream video understanding tasks. Finally, we identify prevailing
challenges and highlight promising directions for future research. By offering
a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to establish a
structured roadmap for advancing video-text learning based on existing ILFM,
and to inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain.

Conclusion: MSM-Seg框架通过双记忆分割范式有效整合多模态和切片间信息，为脑肿瘤分割提供了更准确和实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-modal brain tumor segmentation is critical for clinical diagnosis, and
it requires accurate identification of distinct internal anatomical subregions.
While the recent prompt-based segmentation paradigms enable interactive
experiences for clinicians, existing methods ignore cross-modal correlations
and rely on labor-intensive category-specific prompts, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a
MSM-Seg framework for multi-modal brain tumor segmentation. The MSM-Seg
introduces a novel dual-memory segmentation paradigm that synergistically
integrates multi-modal and inter-slice information with the efficient
category-agnostic prompt for brain tumor understanding. To this end, we first
devise a modality-and-slice memory attention (MSMA) to exploit the cross-modal
and inter-slice relationships among the input scans. Then, we propose a
multi-scale category-agnostic prompt encoder (MCP-Encoder) to provide tumor
region guidance for decoding. Moreover, we devise a modality-adaptive fusion
decoder (MF-Decoder) that leverages the complementary decoding information
across different modalities to improve segmentation accuracy. Extensive
experiments on different MRI datasets demonstrate that our MSM-Seg framework
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-modal metastases and glioma tumor
segmentation. The code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/MSM-Seg.

Conclusion: 动作动态学习和跨时间交互对于动作理解研究具有重要意义，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Action understanding, encompassing action detection and anticipation, plays a
crucial role in numerous practical applications. However, untrimmed videos are
often characterized by substantial redundant information and noise. Moreover,
in modeling action understanding, the influence of the agent's intention on the
action is often overlooked. Motivated by these issues, we propose a novel
framework called the State-Specific Model (SSM), designed to unify and enhance
both action detection and anticipation tasks. In the proposed framework, the
Critical State-Based Memory Compression module compresses frame sequences into
critical states, reducing information redundancy. The Action Pattern Learning
module constructs a state-transition graph with multi-dimensional edges to
model action dynamics in complex scenarios, on the basis of which potential
future cues can be generated to represent intention. Furthermore, our
Cross-Temporal Interaction module models the mutual influence between
intentions and past as well as current information through cross-temporal
interactions, thereby refining present and future features and ultimately
realizing simultaneous action detection and anticipation. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmark datasets -- including EPIC-Kitchens-100, THUMOS'14,
TVSeries, and the introduced Parkinson's Disease Mouse Behaviour (PDMB) dataset
-- demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed framework compared to
other state-of-the-art approaches. These results highlight the importance of
action dynamics learning and cross-temporal interactions, laying a foundation
for future action understanding research.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework that allows high-quality dynamic
Gaussian Splatting from both defocused and motion-blurred monocular videos. Due
to the significant difference between the formation processes of defocus blur
and motion blur, existing methods are tailored for either one of them, lacking
the ability to simultaneously deal with both of them. Although the two can be
jointly modeled as blur kernel-based convolution, the inherent difficulty in
estimating accurate blur kernels greatly limits the progress in this direction.
In this work, we go a step further towards this direction. Particularly, we
propose to estimate per-pixel reliable blur kernels using a blur prediction
network that exploits blur-related scene and camera information and is subject
to a blur-aware sparsity constraint. Besides, we introduce a dynamic Gaussian
densification strategy to mitigate the lack of Gaussians for incomplete
regions, and boost the performance of novel view synthesis by incorporating
unseen view information to constrain scene optimization. Extensive experiments
show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in generating
photorealistic novel view synthesis from defocused and motion-blurred monocular
videos. Our code and trained model will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Virtual and augmented reality systems increasingly demand intelligent
adaptation to user behaviors for enhanced interaction experiences. Achieving
this requires accurately understanding human intentions and predicting future
situated behaviors - such as gaze direction and object interactions - which is
vital for creating responsive VR/AR environments and applications like
personalized assistants. However, accurate behavioral prediction demands
modeling the underlying cognitive processes that drive human-environment
interactions. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical, intention-aware
framework that models human intentions and predicts detailed situated behaviors
by leveraging cognitive mechanisms. Given historical human dynamics and the
observation of scene contexts, our framework first identifies potential
interaction targets and forecasts fine-grained future behaviors. We propose a
dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to effectively capture
human-environment relationships. Extensive experiments on challenging
real-world benchmarks and live VR environment demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, achieving superior performance across all metrics and enabling
practical applications for proactive VR systems that anticipate user behaviors
and adapt virtual environments accordingly.

Conclusion: 为科学探索和可扩展生物多样性监测提供了实用方法，强调稳健帧选择和共识标注的重要性。

Abstract: Underwater video monitoring is a promising strategy for assessing marine
biodiversity, but the vast volume of uneventful footage makes manual inspection
highly impractical. In this work, we explore the use of visual anomaly
detection (VAD) based on deep neural networks to automatically identify
interesting or anomalous events. We introduce AURA, the first multi-annotator
benchmark dataset for underwater VAD, and evaluate four VAD models across two
marine scenes. We demonstrate the importance of robust frame selection
strategies to extract meaningful video segments. Our comparison against
multiple annotators reveals that VAD performance of current models varies
dramatically and is highly sensitive to both the amount of training data and
the variability in visual content that defines "normal" scenes. Our results
highlight the value of soft and consensus labels and offer a practical approach

*Kagan Ozturk,Aman Bhatta,Haiyu Wu,Patrick Flynn,Kevin W. Bowyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可解释的人脸相似性度量方法，通过将全局相似性分解为局部补丁贡献，无需后处理分析即可提供局部可加性解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于后处理方法对模型实际推理的忠实度存在不确定性，需要设计决策过程本身可解释的模型。

Method: 将两张人脸图像的相似性定义为补丁级相似性得分的总和，使用受限感受野来分解全局相似性。

Result: 在112x112人脸图像中使用28x28补丁时达到竞争性验证性能，使用56x56补丁时超越最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法提供了一种内在可解释的人脸相似性度量，在保持性能的同时增强了模型决策过程的可解释性。

Abstract: Understanding how deep neural networks make decisions is crucial for
analyzing their behavior and diagnosing failure cases. In computer vision, a
common approach to improve interpretability is to assign importance to
individual pixels using post-hoc methods. Although they are widely used to
explain black-box models, their fidelity to the model's actual reasoning is
uncertain due to the lack of reliable evaluation metrics. This limitation
motivates an alternative approach, which is to design models whose decision
processes are inherently interpretable. To this end, we propose a face
similarity metric that breaks down global similarity into contributions from
restricted receptive fields. Our method defines the similarity between two face
images as the sum of patch-level similarity scores, providing a locally
additive explanation without relying on post-hoc analysis. We show that the
proposed approach achieves competitive verification performance even with
patches as small as 28x28 within 112x112 face images, and surpasses
state-of-the-art methods when using 56x56 patches.

Abstract: Identifying drones and birds correctly is essential for keeping the skies
safe and improving security systems. Using the VIP CUP 2025 dataset, which
provides both RGB and infrared (IR) images, this study presents EGD-YOLOv8n, a
new lightweight yet powerful model for object detection. The model improves how
image features are captured and understood, making detection more accurate and
efficient. It uses smart design changes and attention layers to focus on
important details while reducing the amount of computation needed. A special
detection head helps the model adapt to objects of different shapes and sizes.
We trained three versions: one using RGB images, one using IR images, and one
combining both. The combined model achieved the best accuracy and reliability
while running fast enough for real-time use on common GPUs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于图的2.5D方法处理3D胸部CT多标签分类，通过将轴向切片三元组作为图节点，使用谱图卷积捕捉切片间依赖关系，在三个独立机构数据集上验证了良好的跨数据集泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着CT检查量增加，需要自动化工具支持放射科医生。现有3D CNN方法难以捕捉长距离依赖，而Vision Transformer需要大量领域特定预训练数据。

Method: 将3D CT体积表示为结构化图，轴向切片三元组作为节点，通过谱图卷积处理，能够推理切片间依赖关系同时保持临床部署兼容的复杂度。

Result: 在三个独立机构数据集上训练和评估，实现了强大的跨数据集泛化能力，与最先进的视觉编码器相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法在胸部CT多标签分类中表现优异，并通过转移实验展示了在自动放射学报告生成和腹部CT数据上的更广泛适用性。

Abstract: With the growing volume of CT examinations, there is an increasing demand for
automated tools such as organ segmentation, abnormality detection, and report
generation to support radiologists in managing their clinical workload.
Multi-label classification of 3D Chest CT scans remains a critical yet
challenging problem due to the complex spatial relationships inherent in
volumetric data and the wide variability of abnormalities. Existing methods
based on 3D convolutional neural networks struggle to capture long-range
dependencies, while Vision Transformers often require extensive pre-training on
large-scale, domain-specific datasets to perform competitively. In this work,
we propose a 2.5D alternative by introducing a new graph-based framework that
represents 3D CT volumes as structured graphs, where axial slice triplets serve
as nodes processed through spectral graph convolution, enabling the model to
reason over inter-slice dependencies while maintaining complexity compatible
with clinical deployment. Our method, trained and evaluated on 3 datasets from
independent institutions, achieves strong cross-dataset generalization, and
shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art visual encoders. We
further conduct comprehensive ablation studies to evaluate the impact of
various aggregation strategies, edge-weighting schemes, and graph connectivity
patterns. Additionally, we demonstrate the broader applicability of our
approach through transfer experiments on automated radiology report generation
and abdominal CT data.\\ This work extends our previous contribution presented
at the MICCAI 2025 EMERGE Workshop.

TL;DR: 提出了DISC-GAN框架，通过风格-内容解耦和聚类特定训练策略实现逼真的水下图像合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像合成面临颜色衰减和浑浊等光学现象挑战，这些现象在不同水域表现为不同的风格变化。现有生成模型难以建模多样化水下环境的非均匀条件。

Method: 使用K-means聚类将数据集划分为风格特定域，采用分离编码器获取风格和内容的潜在空间，通过AdaIN整合潜在表示并解码生成最终合成图像，在每个风格簇上独立训练以保持域特定特征。

Result: 获得了最先进的性能：SSIM为0.9012，平均PSNR为32.5118 dB，FID为13.3728。

Conclusion: DISC-GAN框架能够有效合成逼真的水下图像，在多个评估指标上表现出色。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Disentangled Style-Content GAN
(DISC-GAN), which integrates style-content disentanglement with a
cluster-specific training strategy towards photorealistic underwater image
synthesis. The quality of synthetic underwater images is challenged by optical
due to phenomena such as color attenuation and turbidity. These phenomena are
represented by distinct stylistic variations across different waterbodies, such
as changes in tint and haze. While generative models are well-suited to capture
complex patterns, they often lack the ability to model the non-uniform
conditions of diverse underwater environments. To address these challenges, we
employ K-means clustering to partition a dataset into style-specific domains.
We use separate encoders to get latent spaces for style and content; we further
integrate these latent representations via Adaptive Instance Normalization
(AdaIN) and decode the result to produce the final synthetic image. The model
is trained independently on each style cluster to preserve domain-specific
characteristics. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance,
obtaining a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.9012, an average Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 32.5118 dB, and a Frechet Inception Distance
(FID) of 13.3728.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D可变形模型依赖严格拓扑结构和线性特性，难以表示复杂的全头形状，且现有方法的潜在空间划分导致维度昂贵。

Method: 保留单一紧凑身份空间，引入中间区域特定潜在表示实现局部编辑，使用4K个不同身份的大规模数据集进行训练。

Result: 实验表明模型在表示多样身份和表情方面具有更强的表达能力，优于先前方法，并提供可解释的3D面部操作解决方案。

Conclusion: imHead模型成功解决了传统3DMM的限制，实现了高效的局部编辑和多样化的3D头部建模。

Abstract: Over the last years, 3D morphable models (3DMMs) have emerged as a
state-of-the-art methodology for modeling and generating expressive 3D avatars.
However, given their reliance on a strict topology, along with their linear
nature, they struggle to represent complex full-head shapes. Following the
advent of deep implicit functions, we propose imHead, a novel implicit 3DMM
that not only models expressive 3D head avatars but also facilitates localized
editing of the facial features. Previous methods directly divided the latent
space into local components accompanied by an identity encoding to capture the
global shape variations, leading to expensive latent sizes. In contrast, we
retain a single compact identity space and introduce an intermediate
region-specific latent representation to enable local edits. To train imHead,
we curate a large-scale dataset of 4K distinct identities, making a
step-towards large scale 3D head modeling. Under a series of experiments we
demonstrate the expressive power of the proposed model to represent diverse
identities and expressions outperforming previous approaches. Additionally, the
proposed approach provides an interpretable solution for 3D face manipulation,
allowing the user to make localized edits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量的公开分割标注对图像处理领域至关重要，特别是对于大量目标的体积图像标注耗时且具有挑战性。

Method: 三名不同标注者对Cell Tracking Challenge中的两个MDA231细胞序列进行了完整的3D时间推移分割标注。

Result: 创建的标注与CTC发布的跟踪标记一致，分割精度在标注者间变异性范围内，且比CTC自动生成的银标准更好地反映了输入图像的复杂性。

Conclusion: 该标注数据集可用于测试和训练细胞分割，或分析高度动态物体的3D形状。

Abstract: High-quality, publicly available segmentation annotations of image and video
datasets are critical for advancing the field of image processing. In
particular, annotations of volumetric images of a large number of targets are
time-consuming and challenging. In (Melnikova, A., & Matula, P., 2025), we
presented the first publicly available full 3D time-lapse segmentation
annotations of migrating cells with complex dynamic shapes. Concretely, three
distinct humans annotated two sequences of MDA231 human breast carcinoma cells
(Fluo-C3DL-MDA231) from the Cell Tracking Challenge (CTC).
  This paper aims to provide a comprehensive description of the dataset and
accompanying experiments that were not included in (Melnikova, A., & Matula,
P., 2025) due to limitations in publication space. Namely, we show that the
created annotations are consistent with the previously published tracking
markers provided by the CTC organizers and the segmentation accuracy measured
based on the 2D gold truth of CTC is within the inter-annotator variability
margins. We compared the created 3D annotations with automatically created
silver truth provided by CTC. We have found the proposed annotations better
represent the complexity of the input images. The presented annotations can be
used for testing and training cell segmentation, or analyzing 3D shapes of
highly dynamic objects.

Conclusion: 该模型在大规模地球观测任务和实际应用中具有有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Clouds remain a critical challenge in optical satellite imagery, hindering
reliable analysis for environmental monitoring, land cover mapping, and climate
research. To overcome this, we propose MSCloudCAM, a Cross-Attention with
Multi-Scale Context Network tailored for multispectral and multi-sensor cloud
segmentation. Our framework exploits the spectral richness of Sentinel-2
(CloudSEN12) and Landsat-8 (L8Biome) data to classify four semantic categories:
clear sky, thin cloud, thick cloud, and cloud shadow. MSCloudCAM combines a
Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical feature extraction with multi-scale
context modules ASPP and PSP for enhanced scale-aware learning. A
Cross-Attention block enables effective multisensor and multispectral feature
fusion, while the integration of an Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB)
and a Spatial Attention Module adaptively refine feature representations.
Comprehensive experiments on CloudSEN12 and L8Biome demonstrate that MSCloudCAM
delivers state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, surpassing leading baseline
architectures while maintaining competitive parameter efficiency and FLOPs.
These results underscore the model's effectiveness and practicality, making it
well-suited for large-scale Earth observation tasks and real-world
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在胸部X光诊断中可能加剧医疗不平等，当性能在不同人口统计群体间存在差异时。

Method: 扩展CNN-XGBoost管道支持多标签分类，用XGBoost替换CNN最后一层，验证DenseNet-121和ResNet-50骨干网络，与传统偏差缓解技术比较。

Result: XGBoost重训练在保持或改善预测性能的同时提高了子群体公平性，与主动学习结合在所有人口统计子群体中实现了最大的偏差减少。

Conclusion: 该方法为临床放射学中公平深度学习部署提供了一条实用有效的路径，在CheXpert和MIMIC数据集上验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown promise in improving diagnostic accuracy from
chest X-rays, but they also risk perpetuating healthcare disparities when
performance varies across demographic groups. In this work, we present a
comprehensive bias detection and mitigation framework targeting sex, age, and
race-based disparities when performing diagnostic tasks with chest X-rays. We
extend a recent CNN-XGBoost pipeline to support multi-label classification and
evaluate its performance across four medical conditions. We show that replacing
the final layer of CNN with an eXtreme Gradient Boosting classifier improves
the fairness of the subgroup while maintaining or improving the overall
predictive performance. To validate its generalizability, we apply the method
to different backbones, namely DenseNet-121 and ResNet-50, and achieve
similarly strong performance and fairness outcomes, confirming its
model-agnostic design. We further compare this lightweight adapter training
method with traditional full-model training bias mitigation techniques,
including adversarial training, reweighting, data augmentation, and active
learning, and find that our approach offers competitive or superior bias
reduction at a fraction of the computational cost. Finally, we show that
combining eXtreme Gradient Boosting retraining with active learning yields the
largest reduction in bias across all demographic subgroups, both in and out of
distribution on the CheXpert and MIMIC datasets, establishing a practical and
effective path toward equitable deep learning deployment in clinical radiology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出两种3D人体网格恢复的合并策略：误差约束层合并和掩码引导令牌合并，结合扩散解码器，在多个基准测试中实现2.3倍加速且性能略有提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于transformer的3D人体网格恢复模型虽然性能强大，但存在计算成本高和复杂度大的问题，主要源于深层transformer架构和冗余令牌。

Method: 1. 误差约束层合并：选择性合并对MPJPE影响最小的transformer层；2. 掩码引导令牌合并：专注于合并对最终预测贡献小的背景令牌；3. 扩散解码器：结合时间上下文并利用从大规模运动捕捉数据集中学习的姿态先验。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法实现了高达2.3倍的加速，同时性能相比基线略有提升。

Conclusion: 提出的合并策略和扩散解码器有效解决了transformer-based HMR模型的计算效率问题，在保持甚至提升性能的同时显著加速推理过程。

Abstract: Recent transformer-based models for 3D Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) have
achieved strong performance but often suffer from high computational cost and
complexity due to deep transformer architectures and redundant tokens. In this
paper, we introduce two HMR-specific merging strategies: Error-Constrained
Layer Merging (ECLM) and Mask-guided Token Merging (Mask-ToMe). ECLM
selectively merges transformer layers that have minimal impact on the Mean Per
Joint Position Error (MPJPE), while Mask-ToMe focuses on merging background
tokens that contribute little to the final prediction. To further address the
potential performance drop caused by merging, we propose a diffusion-based
decoder that incorporates temporal context and leverages pose priors learned
from large-scale motion capture datasets. Experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves up to 2.3x speed-up while
slightly improving performance over the baseline.

Result: 实验结果表明这种对齐显著提升了LiDAR点云分割模型在真实数据上的性能。

Conclusion: 通过合成数据增强和跨域对齐方法有效解决了点云分割中的长尾问题。

Abstract: Real-world point cloud datasets have made significant contributions to the
development of LiDAR-based perception technologies, such as object segmentation
for autonomous driving. However, due to the limited number of instances in some
rare classes, the long-tail problem remains a major challenge in existing
datasets. To address this issue, we introduce a novel, synthetic point cloud
dataset named RareBoost3D, which complements existing real-world datasets by
providing significantly more instances for object classes that are rare in
real-world datasets. To effectively leverage both synthetic and real-world
data, we further propose a cross-domain semantic alignment method named CSC
loss that aligns feature representations of the same class across different
domains. Experimental results demonstrate that this alignment significantly
enhances the performance of LiDAR point cloud segmentation models over
real-world data.

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在开放世界条件下的图像地理定位能力尚未得到全面评估，而这项任务在现实生活中具有重要应用价值和挑战性。

Method: 构建包含810张全球分布图像的EarthWhere基准，分为WhereCountry（国家级别多选问答）和WhereStreet（街道级别多步推理任务），采用最终预测指标和基于Shapley值的思维评分方法。

Result: Gemini-2.5-Pro达到最佳平均准确率56.32%，最强开源模型GLM-4.5V达到34.71%。研究发现网络搜索和推理在视觉线索有限时不一定能提升性能，模型存在区域偏见。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了视觉语言模型在地理定位任务中的潜力和挑战，特别是在减少偏见和实现鲁棒细粒度定位方面仍需改进。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly, yet their capacity for
image-grounded geolocation in open-world conditions, a task that is challenging
and of demand in real life, has not been comprehensively evaluated. We present
EarthWhere, a comprehensive benchmark for VLM image geolocation that evaluates
visual recognition, step-by-step reasoning, and evidence use. EarthWhere
comprises 810 globally distributed images across two complementary geolocation
scales: WhereCountry (i.e., 500 multiple-choice question-answering, with
country-level answer and panoramas) and WhereStreet (i.e., 310 fine-grained
street-level identification tasks requiring multi-step reasoning with optional
web search). For evaluation, we adopt the final-prediction metrics: location
accuracies within k km (Acc@k) for coordinates and hierarchical path scores for
textual localization. Beyond this, we propose to explicitly score intermediate
reasoning chains using human-verified key visual clues and a Shapley-reweighted
thinking score that attributes credit to each clue's marginal contribution. We
benchmark 13 state-of-the-art VLMs with web searching tools on our EarthWhere
and report different types of final answer accuracies as well as the calibrated
model thinking scores. Overall, Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the best average
accuracy at 56.32%, while the strongest open-weight model, GLM-4.5V, reaches
34.71%. We reveal that web search and reasoning do not guarantee improved
performance when visual clues are limited, and models exhibit regional biases,
achieving up to 42.7% higher scores in certain areas than others. These
findings highlight not only the promise but also the persistent challenges of
models to mitigate bias and achieve robust, fine-grained localization. We
open-source our benchmark at https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/EarthWhere.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多语言视觉-语言模型存在嵌入空间偏向英语的问题，且只关注实例级对齐而忽略了全局几何结构

Method: 提出拓扑感知框架ToMCLIP，使用持久同调定义拓扑对齐损失，并通过图稀疏化策略近似持久图

Result: 实验显示该方法增强了多语言表示的结构一致性，在CIFAR-100上获得更高零样本准确率，在xFlickr&CO上实现更强的多语言检索性能

Conclusion: ToMCLIP不仅改进了多语言VLMs，还提供了一个将拓扑对齐融入表示学习的通用方法

Abstract: Contrastive Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot
capabilities. However, their cross-modal alignment remains biased toward
English due to limited multilingual multimodal data. Recent multilingual
extensions have alleviated this gap but enforce instance-level alignment while
neglecting the global geometry of the shared embedding space. We address this
problem by introducing ToMCLIP (Topological Alignment for Multilingual CLIP), a
topology-aware framework aligning embedding spaces with topology-preserving
constraints. The proposed method applies persistent homology to define a
topological alignment loss and approximates persistence diagram with
theoretical error bounds using graph sparsification strategy. This work
validates the proposed approach, showing enhanced structural coherence of
multilingual representations, higher zero-shot accuracy on the CIFAR-100, and
stronger multilingual retrieval performance on the xFlickr&CO. Beyond VLMs, the
proposed approach provides a general method for incorporating topological
alignment into representation learning.

Motivation: 现有场景文本编辑方法通常局限于内容替换和简单风格，缺乏自由风格迁移能力，无法实现灵活和局部化的文本风格编辑。

Method: 设计了特征注入模块利用扩散模型反演和自注意力机制有效迁移风格特征；引入区域控制机制通过距离变化掩码实现精确空间控制；基于傅里叶变换的风格增强模块增强风格丰富度。

Result: 在场景文本风格转换中表现出卓越性能，在视觉保真度和文本保持方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了场景文本灵活局部化风格编辑的挑战，实现了高质量的风格转换效果。

Abstract: With the rapid development of diffusion models, style transfer has made
remarkable progress. However, flexible and localized style editing for scene
text remains an unsolved challenge. Although existing scene text editing
methods have achieved text region editing, they are typically limited to
content replacement and simple styles, which lack the ability of free-style
transfer. In this paper, we introduce SceneTextStylizer, a novel training-free
diffusion-based framework for flexible and high-fidelity style transfer of text
in scene images. Unlike prior approaches that either perform global style
transfer or focus solely on textual content modification, our method enables
prompt-guided style transformation specifically for text regions, while
preserving both text readability and stylistic consistency. To achieve this, we
design a feature injection module that leverages diffusion model inversion and
self-attention to transfer style features effectively. Additionally, a region
control mechanism is introduced by applying a distance-based changing mask at
each denoising step, enabling precise spatial control. To further enhance
visual quality, we incorporate a style enhancement module based on the Fourier
transform to reinforce stylistic richness. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves superior performance in scene text style
transformation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual
fidelity and text preservation.

TL;DR: FG-CLIP 2是一个双语视觉语言模型，通过细粒度监督和多种判别目标，在英语和中文上实现了先进的细粒度对齐能力，并在29个数据集上取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在细粒度理解方面存在局限，特别是在非英语环境下，难以准确捕捉物体属性、空间关系和语言表达的细微差异，且双语理解能力有限。

Method: 采用细粒度监督（包括区域-文本匹配和长文本建模）、多种判别目标，并引入文本模态内对比损失来更好区分语义相似的描述，使用大规模英中双语数据进行训练。

Result: 在29个数据集和8个任务上的广泛实验表明，FG-CLIP 2超越了现有方法，在两种语言上都取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FG-CLIP 2通过创新的细粒度对齐方法显著提升了双语视觉语言理解能力，为未来双语细粒度对齐研究提供了模型、代码和基准数据集。

Abstract: Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires precise alignment between
visual content and linguistic descriptions, a capability that remains limited
in current models, particularly in non-English settings. While models like CLIP
perform well on global alignment, they often struggle to capture fine-grained
details in object attributes, spatial relations, and linguistic expressions,
with limited support for bilingual comprehension. To address these challenges,
we introduce FG-CLIP 2, a bilingual vision-language model designed to advance
fine-grained alignment for both English and Chinese. Our approach leverages
rich fine-grained supervision, including region-text matching and long-caption
modeling, alongside multiple discriminative objectives. We further introduce
the Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss to better distinguish
semantically similar captions. Trained on a carefully curated mixture of
large-scale English and Chinese data, FG-CLIP 2 achieves powerful bilingual
performance. To enable rigorous evaluation, we present a new benchmark for
Chinese multimodal understanding, featuring long-caption retrieval and bounding
box classification. Extensive experiments on 29 datasets across 8 tasks show
that FG-CLIP 2 outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results
in both languages. We release the model, code, and benchmark to facilitate
future research on bilingual fine-grained alignment.

### [133] [DKPMV: Dense Keypoints Fusion from Multi-View RGB Frames for 6D Pose Estimation of Textureless Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10933)
*Jiahong Chen,Jinghao Wang,Zi Wang,Ziwen Wang,Banglei Guan,Qifeng Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DKPMV是一个仅使用多视角RGB图像进行6D姿态估计的管道，通过密集关键点级融合和三阶段渐进式姿态优化策略，在ROBI数据集上超越了现有RGB方法和大多数RGB-D方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多视角方法要么依赖深度数据，要么未能充分利用多视角几何线索，限制了在纹理缺失物体上的性能。

Method: 设计三阶段渐进式姿态优化策略，利用密集多视角关键点几何信息；增强关键点网络，加入注意力聚合和对称感知训练，提高预测精度并解决对称物体模糊问题。

Result: 在ROBI数据集上的广泛实验表明，DKPMV优于最先进的多视角RGB方法，在大多数情况下甚至超过了RGB-D方法。

Conclusion: DKPMV证明了仅使用RGB图像就能实现高质量的6D姿态估计，为工业机器人应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: 6D pose estimation of textureless objects is valuable for industrial robotic
applications, yet remains challenging due to the frequent loss of depth
information. Current multi-view methods either rely on depth data or
insufficiently exploit multi-view geometric cues, limiting their performance.
In this paper, we propose DKPMV, a pipeline that achieves dense keypoint-level
fusion using only multi-view RGB images as input. We design a three-stage
progressive pose optimization strategy that leverages dense multi-view keypoint
geometry information. To enable effective dense keypoint fusion, we enhance the
keypoint network with attentional aggregation and symmetry-aware training,
improving prediction accuracy and resolving ambiguities on symmetric objects.
Extensive experiments on the ROBI dataset demonstrate that DKPMV outperforms
state-of-the-art multi-view RGB approaches and even surpasses the RGB-D methods
in the majority of cases. The code will be available soon.

### [134] [Towards Distribution-Shift Uncertainty Estimation for Inverse Problems with Generative Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10947)
*Namhoon Kim,Sara Fridovich-Keil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需校准的实例级不确定性指标，用于检测生成模型在逆问题重建中的分布偏移风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型作为数据驱动先验在逆问题重建中表现良好，但当测试图像超出训练分布时可能产生幻觉特征。现有不确定性量化方法需要校准数据集或仅提供启发式估计。

Method: 基于重建稳定性假设：分布内图像在随机测量变化下重建稳定，而分布外图像重建不稳定。利用这种稳定性作为分布偏移的代理检测指标。

Result: 在MNIST数字断层重建实验中，仅用数字"0"训练的网络在重建其他数字时显示出更高的变异性和重建误差，验证了该指标的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为生成先验提供了轻量级防护机制，可在分布内情况下实现激进测量减少，同时在分布外应用时自动发出警告。

Abstract: Generative models have shown strong potential as data-driven priors for
solving inverse problems such as reconstructing medical images from
undersampled measurements. While these priors improve reconstruction quality
with fewer measurements, they risk hallucinating features when test images lie
outside the training distribution. Existing uncertainty quantification methods
in this setting (i) require an in-distribution calibration dataset, which may
not be available, (ii) provide heuristic rather than statistical estimates, or
(iii) quantify uncertainty from model capacity or limited measurements rather
than distribution shift. We propose an instance-level, calibration-free
uncertainty indicator that is sensitive to distribution shift, requires no
knowledge of the training distribution, and incurs no retraining cost. Our key
hypothesis is that reconstructions of in-distribution images remain stable
under random measurement variations, while reconstructions of
out-of-distribution (OOD) images exhibit greater instability. We use this
stability as a proxy for detecting distribution shift. Our proposed OOD
indicator is efficiently computable for any computational imaging inverse
problem; we demonstrate it on tomographic reconstruction of MNIST digits, where
a learned proximal network trained only on digit "0" is evaluated on all ten
digits. Reconstructions of OOD digits show higher variability and
correspondingly higher reconstruction error, validating this indicator. These
results suggest a deployment strategy that pairs generative priors with
lightweight guardrails, enabling aggressive measurement reduction for
in-distribution cases while automatically warning when priors are applied out
of distribution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了IUT-Plug模块，通过图像理解树增强现有交错视觉语言模型，解决逻辑、对象身份和风格保持问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在图像文本生成中难以保持逻辑、对象身份和风格一致性，限制了在复杂场景中的泛化能力。

Method: 两阶段框架：1)动态IUT-Plug提取模块将视觉场景解析为层次符号结构；2)协调的叙事流和图像合成机制确保跨模态一致性。

Result: 实验表明IUT-Plug不仅提高了基准测试准确率，还有效缓解了三种关键上下文漂移问题。

Conclusion: IUT-Plug通过显式结构化推理显著增强了视觉语言模型在复杂图像文本场景中的性能。

Abstract: Existing vision language models (VLMs), including GPT-4 and DALL-E, often
struggle to preserve logic, object identity, and style in multimodal image-text
generation. This limitation significantly hinders the generalization capability
of VLMs in complex image-text input-output scenarios. To address this issue, we
propose IUT-Plug, a module grounded in an Image Understanding Tree (IUT), which
enhances existing interleaved VLMs through explicit structured reasoning,
thereby mitigating context drift in logic, entity identity, and style. The
proposed framework operates in two stages. (1) A dynamic IUT-Plug extraction
module parses visual scenes into hierarchical symbolic structures. (2) A
coordinated narrative-flow and image synthesis mechanism ensures cross-modal
consistency. To evaluate our approach, we construct a novel benchmark based on
3,000 real human-generated question-answer pairs over fine-tuned large models,
introducing a dynamic evaluation protocol for quantifying context drift in
interleaved VLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that IUT-Plug not only
improves accuracy on established benchmarks but also effectively alleviates the
three critical forms of context drift across diverse multimodal question
answering (QA) scenarios.

*Sanchit Sinha,Oana Frunza,Kashif Rasul,Yuriy Nevmyvaka,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Chart-RVR是一个通过可验证奖励和GRPO微调LVLMs的框架，用于提高图表推理的鲁棒性和可解释性，在多个基准测试中达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LVLMs在图表推理任务中，面对分布外数据时性能下降，且生成的思维链解释性不足，限制了模型的可信度。

Method: 结合Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)和自动可验证奖励，包括三个奖励函数：正确图表类型分类、忠实图表表格重建和过程一致性。

Result: 在30亿参数LVLMs上，Chart-RVR在分布内和分布外数据集上均优于标准监督微调，在六个图表推理基准测试中达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: Chart-RVR通过可验证奖励和GRPO训练出更可靠、可解释的图表推理模型，提高了模型的信任度和可靠性。

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have reached
state-of-the-art on many visual reasoning tasks, including chart reasoning, yet
they still falter on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and degrade further when
asked to produce their chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, limiting
explainability. We present Chart-RVR, a general framework that fine-tunes LVLMs
to be more robust and explainable for chart reasoning by coupling Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with automatically verifiable rewards. Our
framework comprises of three rewards that maximize: (i) correct chart-type
classification, (ii) faithful chart table reconstruction, and (iii) process
conformity. Applied to 3-billion-parameter LVLMs, Chart-RVR consistently
outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution datasets, closing the OOD performance gap while improving
rationale fidelity. The resulting models, the Chart-RVR-3B series, achieve
state-of-the-art results on six chart-reasoning benchmarks spanning in-domain
and OOD settings, surpassing all existing models of comparable size. Beyond
accuracy, Chart-RVR yields more interpretable CoT rationales, strengthening
trust and reliability - showcasing the power of verifiable rewards with GRPO
for training reliable, interpretable chart-reasoning models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Multimodal Mixup (MM)和Balanced Multimodal Mixup (B-MM)方法，通过在多模态特征层面应用Mixup策略来缓解强模态主导学习的问题，提高多模态视频理解的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态模型容易过拟合强模态，导致弱模态的贡献被抑制，影响多模态视频理解任务的性能。

Method: 首先提出MM方法，在聚合的多模态特征层面应用Mixup策略生成虚拟特征-标签对；然后提出B-MM方法，根据各模态对学习目标的相对贡献动态调整混合比例。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，这些方法能有效提高泛化能力和多模态鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 所提出的MM和B-MM方法能够缓解多模态学习中的模态不平衡问题，提升模型的泛化性能。

Abstract: Multimodal video understanding plays a crucial role in tasks such as action
recognition and emotion classification by combining information from different
modalities. However, multimodal models are prone to overfitting strong
modalities, which can dominate learning and suppress the contributions of
weaker ones. To address this challenge, we first propose Multimodal Mixup (MM),
which applies the Mixup strategy at the aggregated multimodal feature level to
mitigate overfitting by generating virtual feature-label pairs. While MM
effectively improves generalization, it treats all modalities uniformly and
does not account for modality imbalance during training. Building on MM, we
further introduce Balanced Multimodal Mixup (B-MM), which dynamically adjusts
the mixing ratios for each modality based on their relative contributions to
the learning objective. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of our methods in improving generalization and multimodal
robustness.

TL;DR: 本文对Agentic多模态大语言模型进行了全面综述，提出了一个概念框架，将其组织为三个基本维度：智能内部功能、外部工具调用和环境交互，并汇编了开源训练框架和数据集。


<details>

Motivation: 随着自主智能体系统的革命性出现，研究社区正从传统的静态、被动和领域特定的AI智能体转向更动态、主动和可泛化的智能体AI。受智能体AI日益增长的兴趣及其向AGI发展的潜在轨迹的推动。

Method: 建立了一个概念框架，将Agentic MLLMs组织为三个基本维度：(i) 智能内部功能作为系统指挥官，通过推理、反思和记忆实现准确的长时程规划；(ii) 智能外部工具调用，模型主动使用各种外部工具扩展其问题解决能力；(iii) 智能环境交互，将模型置于虚拟或物理环境中，使其能够在动态现实场景中采取行动、调整策略并维持目标导向行为。

Conclusion: 综述了Agentic MLLMs的下游应用，并为这个快速发展的领域规划了未来的研究方向，通过公开存储库持续更新进展。

Abstract: With the recent emergence of revolutionary autonomous agentic systems,
research community is witnessing a significant shift from traditional static,
passive, and domain-specific AI agents toward more dynamic, proactive, and
generalizable agentic AI. Motivated by the growing interest in agentic AI and
its potential trajectory toward AGI, we present a comprehensive survey on
Agentic Multimodal Large Language Models (Agentic MLLMs). In this survey, we
explore the emerging paradigm of agentic MLLMs, delineating their conceptual
foundations and distinguishing characteristics from conventional MLLM-based
agents. We establish a conceptual framework that organizes agentic MLLMs along
three fundamental dimensions: (i) Agentic internal intelligence functions as
the system's commander, enabling accurate long-horizon planning through
reasoning, reflection, and memory; (ii) Agentic external tool invocation,
whereby models proactively use various external tools to extend their
problem-solving capabilities beyond their intrinsic knowledge; and (iii)
Agentic environment interaction further situates models within virtual or
physical environments, allowing them to take actions, adapt strategies, and
sustain goal-directed behavior in dynamic real-world scenarios. To further
accelerate research in this area for the community, we compile open-source
training frameworks, training and evaluation datasets for developing agentic
MLLMs. Finally, we review the downstream applications of agentic MLLMs and
outline future research directions for this rapidly evolving field. To
continuously track developments in this rapidly evolving field, we will also
actively update a public repository at
https://github.com/HJYao00/Awesome-Agentic-MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯修复在虚拟现实和多媒体应用中至关重要，但确保多视图一致性这一高质量修复的关键要求仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 利用视角感知内容传播和一致性验证，通过从视角图中自适应采样多个视图，迭代优化修复结果和3D高斯表示，将修复图像作为先验信息传播并在相邻视图间验证一致性。

Result: 在SPIn-NeRF和NeRFiller数据集上分别取得了26.03 dB和29.51 dB的PSNR分数，证明了方法的优越性。

Conclusion: PAInpainter在3D修复质量和泛化能力方面优于现有方法，有效提升了全局一致性和纹理保真度。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian inpainting, a critical technique for numerous applications in
virtual reality and multimedia, has made significant progress with pretrained
diffusion models. However, ensuring multi-view consistency, an essential
requirement for high-quality inpainting, remains a key challenge. In this work,
we present PAInpainter, a novel approach designed to advance 3D Gaussian
inpainting by leveraging perspective-aware content propagation and consistency
verification across multi-view inpainted images. Our method iteratively refines
inpainting and optimizes the 3D Gaussian representation with multiple views
adaptively sampled from a perspective graph. By propagating inpainted images as
prior information and verifying consistency across neighboring views,
PAInpainter substantially enhances global consistency and texture fidelity in
restored 3D scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
PAInpainter over existing methods. Our approach achieves superior 3D inpainting
quality, with PSNR scores of 26.03 dB and 29.51 dB on the SPIn-NeRF and
NeRFiller datasets, respectively, highlighting its effectiveness and
generalization capability.

TL;DR: ContextGen是一个用于多实例图像生成的扩散Transformer框架，通过布局和参考图像引导生成，解决了现有扩散模型在对象布局控制和多主体身份保持方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代扩散模型在多实例图像生成中存在关键限制，难以实现精确的对象布局控制，也无法保持多个不同主体的身份一致性。

Method: 提出了ContextGen框架，包含两个关键技术：上下文布局锚定机制将复合布局图像整合到生成上下文中，确保对象在期望位置；身份一致性注意力机制利用上下文参考图像确保多个实例的身份一致性。

Result: ContextGen在控制精度、身份保真度和整体视觉质量方面优于现有方法，创造了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: ContextGen通过创新的布局锚定和身份一致性机制，有效解决了多实例图像生成的挑战，并引入了首个具有详细布局和身份标注的大规模数据集IMIG-100K。

Abstract: Multi-instance image generation (MIG) remains a significant challenge for
modern diffusion models due to key limitations in achieving precise control
over object layout and preserving the identity of multiple distinct subjects.
To address these limitations, we introduce ContextGen, a novel Diffusion
Transformer framework for multi-instance generation that is guided by both
layout and reference images. Our approach integrates two key technical
contributions: a Contextual Layout Anchoring (CLA) mechanism that incorporates
the composite layout image into the generation context to robustly anchor the
objects in their desired positions, and Identity Consistency Attention (ICA),
an innovative attention mechanism that leverages contextual reference images to
ensure the identity consistency of multiple instances. Recognizing the lack of
large-scale, hierarchically-structured datasets for this task, we introduce
IMIG-100K, the first dataset with detailed layout and identity annotations.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ContextGen sets a new state-of-the-art,
outperforming existing methods in control precision, identity fidelity, and
overall visual quality.

TL;DR: 提出FASS框架解决医学图像中低对比度肿瘤分割难题，通过前景感知、频率增强和边缘约束模块提升分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在复杂低对比度背景下难以聚焦前景区域，特别是当恶性肿瘤与正常器官相似时，上下文区分变得困难。

Method: FASS框架包含三个模块：前景感知模块增强背景与体积空间区分；基于小波变换的频率增强模块提取高频特征；边缘约束模块保持分割边界几何连续性。

Result: 在多个医学数据集上的实验显示，该框架在所有指标上均表现优异，特别是在复杂条件下的鲁棒性和精细结构识别方面。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了低对比度图像的分割效果，为更复杂多样的医学影像应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tumors and adjacent normal tissues in medical images
is essential for surgical planning and tumor staging. Although foundation
models generally perform well in segmentation tasks, they often struggle to
focus on foreground areas in complex, low-contrast backgrounds, where some
malignant tumors closely resemble normal organs, complicating contextual
differentiation. To address these challenges, we propose the Foreground-Aware
Spectrum Segmentation (FASS) framework. First, we introduce a foreground-aware
module to amplify the distinction between background and the entire volume
space, allowing the model to concentrate more effectively on target areas.
Next, a feature-level frequency enhancement module, based on wavelet transform,
extracts discriminative high-frequency features to enhance boundary recognition
and detail perception. Eventually, we introduce an edge constraint module to
preserve geometric continuity in segmentation boundaries. Extensive experiments
on multiple medical datasets demonstrate superior performance across all
metrics, validating the effectiveness of our framework, particularly in
robustness under complex conditions and fine structure recognition. Our
framework significantly enhances segmentation of low-contrast images, paving
the way for applications in more diverse and complex medical imaging scenarios.

Result: 在四个组合性基准测试（Winoground、EqBench、ColorSwap、SugarCrepe）和七个不同规模的开源VLM上，COCO-Tree相比基线显著改善了组合泛化性能5-10%。

Conclusion: COCO-Tree通过结合神经符号概念树有效提升了视觉语言模型的组合推理能力，同时提供了可解释的推理过程，在多个基准测试中取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Compositional reasoning remains a persistent weakness of modern vision
language models (VLMs): they often falter when a task hinges on understanding
how multiple objects, attributes, and relations interact within an image.
Multiple research works have attempted to improve compositionality performance
by creative tricks such as improving prompt structure, chain of thought
reasoning, etc. A more recent line of work attempts to impart additional
reasoning in VLMs using well-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), which are
far superior in linguistic understanding than VLMs to compensate for the
limited linguistic prowess of VLMs. However, these approaches are either
resource-intensive or do not provide an interpretable reasoning process. In
this paper, we present 'COCO-Tree' - a novel approach that augments VLM outputs
with carefully designed neurosymbolic concept trees learned from LLMs to
improve VLM's linguistic reasoning. COCO-Tree's beam search-inspired reasoning
process boosts compositionality performance and provides a rationale behind VLM
predictions. Empirical results on four compositionality benchmarks, Winoground,
EqBench, ColorSwap, and SugarCrepe, in seven different open-source VLMs with
varying sizes, demonstrate that COCO-Tree significantly improves compositional
generalization by 5-10% over baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VHPE方法在单一建模结构中难以平衡全局和局部动态建模，且存在二次复杂度问题。Mamba模型在长序列建模方面表现出色但仅限于1D数据，需要扩展到时空领域。

Method: 提出全局时空Mamba进行6D选择性时空扫描和调制合并来提取全局表示，以及基于窗口化时空扫描的局部精炼Mamba来增强局部关键点运动的高频细节。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，该模型优于现有最先进的VHPE方法，同时实现了更好的计算效率平衡。

Conclusion: 该框架成功将Mamba扩展到时空领域，有效解决了VHPE中全局和局部建模的平衡问题，并在性能和计算效率方面都取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Modeling high-resolution spatiotemporal representations, including both
global dynamic contexts (e.g., holistic human motion tendencies) and local
motion details (e.g., high-frequency changes of keypoints), is essential for
video-based human pose estimation (VHPE). Current state-of-the-art methods
typically unify spatiotemporal learning within a single type of modeling
structure (convolution or attention-based blocks), which inherently have
difficulties in balancing global and local dynamic modeling and may bias the
network to one of them, leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, existing
VHPE models suffer from quadratic complexity when capturing global
dependencies, limiting their applicability especially for high-resolution
sequences. Recently, the state space models (known as Mamba) have demonstrated
significant potential in modeling long-range contexts with linear complexity;
however, they are restricted to 1D sequential data. In this paper, we present a
novel framework that extends Mamba from two aspects to separately learn global
and local high-resolution spatiotemporal representations for VHPE.
Specifically, we first propose a Global Spatiotemporal Mamba, which performs 6D
selective space-time scan and spatial- and temporal-modulated scan merging to
efficiently extract global representations from high-resolution sequences. We
further introduce a windowed space-time scan-based Local Refinement Mamba to
enhance the high-frequency details of localized keypoint motions. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model
outperforms state-of-the-art VHPE approaches while achieving better
computational trade-offs.

Motivation: 当前大视觉语言模型在解决复杂几何问题时，辅助线绘制存在挑战，图像编辑模型难以精确渲染几何图形

Method: 使用强化学习框架，通过跨模态奖励评估辅助线描述与真实辅助线图的对齐程度，基于GRPO进行训练

Result: 在3B和7B规模上，GeoVLMath在辅助线推理基准测试中表现优于开源和专有的大视觉语言模型

Conclusion: 文本描述辅助线构造结合强化学习框架能有效提升几何问题解决能力，GeoVLMath在辅助线推理任务上具有竞争力

Abstract: Auxiliary lines are essential for solving complex geometric problems but
remain challenging for large vision-language models (LVLMs). Rather than
editing diagrams to draw auxiliary lines, which current image editing models
struggle to render with geometric precision, we generate textual descriptions
of auxiliary-line constructions to better align with the representational
strengths of LVLMs. To bridge the gap between textual descriptions and spatial
structure, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that enhances
diagram-text alignment. At the core of our approach is a cross-modal reward
that evaluates how well the generated auxiliary-line description for an
original diagram matches a ground-truth auxiliary-line diagram. Built on this
reward, we present GeoVLMath, an open-source LVLM tailored to auxiliary-line
reasoning in solid geometry. This fine-grained signal drives a GRPO-based RL
stage, yielding precise diagram-text alignment. To support training, we develop
a scalable data creation pipeline and construct AuxSolidMath, a dataset of
3,018 real-exam geometry problems with paired diagrams and aligned textual
fields. At the 3B and 7B scales, GeoVLMath achieves competitive and often
superior performance compared with strong open-source and proprietary LVLMs on
auxiliary-line reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: GIR-Bench为评估统一多模态模型提供了全面框架，揭示了当前模型在理解与生成对齐方面的局限性。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models integrate the reasoning capacity of large language
models with both image understanding and generation, showing great promise for
advanced multimodal intelligence. However, the community still lacks a rigorous
reasoning-centric benchmark to systematically evaluate the alignment between
understanding and generation, and their generalization potential in complex
visual tasks. To this end, we introduce \textbf{GIR-Bench}, a comprehensive
benchmark that evaluates unified models across three complementary
perspectives. Firstly, we investigate understanding-generation consistency
(GIR-Bench-UGC), asking whether models can consistently leverage the same
knowledge in both understanding and generation tasks. Secondly, we investigate
whether models can perform reasoning-centric text-to-image generation that
requires applying logical constraints and implicit knowledge to generate
faithful visual content (GIR-Bench-T2I). Thirdly, we evaluate whether models
can handle multi-step reasoning in editing (GIR-Bench-Edit). For each subset,
we carefully design different task-specific evaluation pipelines tailored for
each task. This enables fine-grained and interpretable evaluation while
mitigating biases from the prevalent MLLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. Extensive
ablations over various unified models and generation-only systems have shown
that: Although unified models are more capable of reasoning-driven visual
tasks, they still exhibit a persistent gap between understanding and
generation. The data and code for GIR-Bench are available at

Abstract: While significant research has focused on developing embodied reasoning
capabilities using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or integrating advanced VLMs
into Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end robot control, few
studies directly address the critical gap between upstream VLM-based reasoning
and downstream VLA policy learning. In this work, we take an initial step
toward bridging embodied reasoning with VLA policy learning by introducing
Vlaser - a Vision-Language-Action Model with synergistic embodied reasoning
capability, which is a foundational vision-language model designed to integrate
high-level reasoning with low-level control for embodied agents. Built upon the
high-quality Vlaser-6M dataset, Vlaser achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a range of embodied reasoning benchmarks - including spatial reasoning,
embodied grounding, embodied QA, and task planning. Furthermore, we
systematically examine how different VLM initializations affect supervised VLA
fine-tuning, offering novel insights into mitigating the domain shift between
internet-scale pre-training data and embodied-specific policy learning data.
Based on these insights, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the
WidowX benchmark and competitive performance on the Google Robot benchmark.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的两阶段框架，用于工业异常检测中的零样本异常分割任务，通过结合CLIP和SAM模型的优势，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在零样本异常分割任务中展现出强大的泛化能力，但如何正确引导这些模型解决下游任务仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 提出了两阶段框架：1) Co-Feature Point Prompt Generation (PPG)模块，协同利用CLIP和SAM生成正负点提示，引导SAM专注于分割异常区域而非整个对象；2) Cascaded Prompts for SAM (CPS)模块，使用混合提示与SAM的轻量级解码器级联，实现异常区域的精确分割。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验验证表明，该方法实现了最先进的零样本异常分割结果，特别是在Visa数据集上，F1-max和AP指标分别比现有最优方法高出10.3%和7.7%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过有效结合CLIP的异常定位能力和SAM的边界感知能力，成功解决了零样本异常分割任务，在工业异常检测中表现出色。

Abstract: Recently, the powerful generalization ability exhibited by foundation models
has brought forth new solutions for zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks.
However, guiding these foundation models correctly to address downstream tasks
remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel two-stage framework, for
zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks in industrial anomaly detection. This
framework excellently leverages the powerful anomaly localization capability of
CLIP and the boundary perception ability of SAM.(1) To mitigate SAM's
inclination towards object segmentation, we propose the Co-Feature Point Prompt
Generation (PPG) module. This module collaboratively utilizes CLIP and SAM to
generate positive and negative point prompts, guiding SAM to focus on
segmenting anomalous regions rather than the entire object. (2) To further
optimize SAM's segmentation results and mitigate rough boundaries and isolated
noise, we introduce the Cascaded Prompts for SAM (CPS) module. This module
employs hybrid prompts cascaded with a lightweight decoder of SAM, achieving
precise segmentation of anomalous regions. Across multiple datasets, consistent
experimental validation demonstrates that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art zero-shot anomaly segmentation results. Particularly
noteworthy is our performance on the Visa dataset, where we outperform the
state-of-the-art methods by 10.3\% and 7.7\% in terms of {$F_1$-max} and AP
metrics, respectively.

Abstract: Laryngeal cancer imaging research lacks standardised datasets to enable
reproducible deep learning (DL) model development. We present LaryngealCT, a
curated benchmark of 1,029 computed tomography (CT) scans aggregated from six
collections from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Uniform 1 mm isotropic
volumes of interest encompassing the larynx were extracted using a weakly
supervised parameter search framework validated by clinical experts. 3D DL
architectures (3D CNN, ResNet18,50,101, DenseNet121) were benchmarked on (i)
early (Tis,T1,T2) vs. advanced (T3,T4) and (ii) T4 vs. non-T4 classification
tasks. 3D CNN (AUC-0.881, F1-macro-0.821) and ResNet18 (AUC-0.892,
F1-macro-0.646) respectively outperformed the other models in the two tasks.
Model explainability assessed using 3D GradCAMs with thyroid cartilage overlays
revealed greater peri-cartilage attention in non-T4 cases and focal activations
in T4 predictions. Through open-source data, pretrained models, and integrated

Motivation: 现有基于文本引导的扩散模型在人脸编辑中难以保持身份和结构一致性，需要解决这一限制。

Method: 将人脸表示分解为身份和属性特征，作为联合条件指导反演和反向扩散过程，实现身份和属性的独立控制。

Result: 方法支持仅使用文本提示的复杂多属性人脸编辑任务，无需区域特定输入，速度与DDIM反演相当。

Conclusion: 综合实验证明了该方法的实用性和有效性，在保持身份一致性的同时实现精确的面部属性操作。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-guided diffusion models have shown promise for
general image editing via inversion techniques, but often struggle to maintain
ID and structural consistency in real face editing tasks. To address this
limitation, we propose a zero-shot face editing method based on ID-Attribute
Decoupled Inversion. Specifically, we decompose the face representation into ID
and attribute features, using them as joint conditions to guide both the
inversion and the reverse diffusion processes. This allows independent control
over ID and attributes, ensuring strong ID preservation and structural
consistency while enabling precise facial attribute manipulation. Our method
supports a wide range of complex multi-attribute face editing tasks using only
text prompts, without requiring region-specific input, and operates at a speed
comparable to DDIM inversion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate its
practicality and effectiveness.

Result: 总结了数据集和协议，突出了表现最佳的解决方案，并提炼出新兴趋势，如LLM/MLLM组件和内存感知传播的重要性。

Conclusion: 该挑战赛旨在为在野外环境中实现弹性的、语言感知的视频分割指明未来发展方向。

Abstract: This report presents an overview of the 7th Large-scale Video Object
Segmentation (LSVOS) Challenge held in conjunction with ICCV 2025. Besides the
two traditional tracks of LSVOS that jointly target robustness in realistic
video scenarios: Classic VOS (VOS), and Referring VOS (RVOS), the 2025 edition
features a newly introduced track, Complex VOS (MOSEv2). Building upon prior
insights, MOSEv2 substantially increases difficulty, introducing more
challenging but realistic scenarios including denser small objects, frequent
disappear/reappear events, severe occlusions, adverse weather and lighting,
etc., pushing long-term consistency and generalization beyond curated
benchmarks. The challenge retains standard ${J}$, $F$, and ${J\&F}$ metrics for
VOS and RVOS, while MOSEv2 adopts ${J\&\dot{F}}$ as the primary ranking metric
to better evaluate objects across scales and disappearance cases. We summarize
datasets and protocols, highlight top-performing solutions, and distill
emerging trends, such as the growing role of LLM/MLLM components and
memory-aware propagation, aiming to chart future directions for resilient,
language-aware video segmentation in the wild.

Motivation: 现有源自由目标检测方法主要针对传统检测模型如Faster R-CNN，缺乏专门为DETR架构设计的适配方案，需要专门针对DETR的查询机制进行优化

Result: 在多个广泛使用的基准测试上实现了最先进的性能，证明了方法的有效性和与DETR基SFOD模型的兼容性

Conclusion: FRANCK框架通过专门为DETR设计的特征增强机制，有效提升了源自由目标检测的性能和泛化能力

Abstract: Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) enables knowledge transfer from a source
domain to an unsupervised target domain for object detection without access to
source data. Most existing SFOD approaches are either confined to conventional
object detection (OD) models like Faster R-CNN or designed as general solutions
without tailored adaptations for novel OD architectures, especially Detection
Transformer (DETR). In this paper, we introduce Feature Reweighting ANd
Contrastive Learning NetworK (FRANCK), a novel SFOD framework specifically
designed to perform query-centric feature enhancement for DETRs. FRANCK
comprises four key components: (1) an Objectness Score-based Sample Reweighting
(OSSR) module that computes attention-based objectness scores on multi-scale
encoder feature maps, reweighting the detection loss to emphasize
less-recognized regions; (2) a Contrastive Learning with Matching-based Memory
Bank (CMMB) module that integrates multi-level features into memory banks,
enhancing class-wise contrastive learning; (3) an Uncertainty-weighted
Query-fused Feature Distillation (UQFD) module that improves feature
distillation through prediction quality reweighting and query feature fusion;
and (4) an improved self-training pipeline with a Dynamic Teacher Updating
Interval (DTUI) that optimizes pseudo-label quality. By leveraging these
components, FRANCK effectively adapts a source-pre-trained DETR model to a
target domain with enhanced robustness and generalization. Extensive
experiments on several widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its effectiveness and
compatibility with DETR-based SFOD models.

Motivation: 现有CAD图纸符号识别方法主要关注几何基元，忽略了丰富的文本标注，且缺乏对基元间关系的显式建模，导致对图纸理解不全面。

Method: 构建几何和文本基元的统一表示，使用预训练CNN提取视觉特征作为初始表示，采用基于Transformer的骨干网络，增强类型感知注意力机制来建模不同类型基元间的空间依赖关系。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法在涉及文本标注的符号识别任务上优于现有方法，并在复杂CAD图纸上表现出更好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过整合文本标注和显式建模基元间关系，显著提升了CAD图纸符号识别的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Computer-Aided Design(CAD) drawings in
engineering, architecture, and industrial design, the ability to accurately
interpret and analyze these drawings has become increasingly critical. Among
various subtasks, panoptic symbol spotting plays a vital role in enabling
downstream applications such as CAD automation and design retrieval. Existing
methods primarily focus on geometric primitives within the CAD drawings to
address this task, but they face following major problems: they usually
overlook the rich textual annotations present in CAD drawings and they lack
explicit modeling of relationships among primitives, resulting in
incomprehensive understanding of the holistic drawings. To fill this gap, we
propose a panoptic symbol spotting framework that incorporates textual
annotations. The framework constructs unified representations by jointly
modeling geometric and textual primitives. Then, using visual features extract
by pretrained CNN as the initial representations, a Transformer-based backbone
is employed, enhanced with a type-aware attention mechanism to explicitly model
the different types of spatial dependencies between various primitives.
Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches on symbol spotting tasks involving
textual annotations, and exhibits superior robustness when applied to complex
CAD drawings.

TL;DR: SeerDrive是一个端到端自动驾驶框架，通过联合建模未来场景演化和轨迹规划，在闭环中实现未来感知的轨迹规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶方法依赖单次推理，低估了场景动态及其时间演变的重要性，限制了在复杂驾驶场景中的适应能力。作者认为车辆未来轨迹与环境动态紧密相关，且车辆自身未来状态也会影响周围场景演变。

Method: 提出SeerDrive框架，首先预测未来鸟瞰图表示以预见周围场景动态，然后利用这种前瞻性生成未来上下文感知的轨迹。包含两个关键组件：未来感知规划（将预测的BEV特征注入轨迹规划器）和迭代场景建模与车辆规划（通过协作优化细化未来场景预测和轨迹生成）。

Result: 在NAVSIM和nuScenes基准测试上的广泛实验表明，SeerDrive显著优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过联合建模未来场景演化和轨迹规划的闭环方法，能够显著提升自动驾驶系统的决策能力和适应性。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving methods aim to directly map raw sensor inputs
to future driving actions such as planned trajectories, bypassing traditional
modular pipelines. While these approaches have shown promise, they often
operate under a one-shot paradigm that relies heavily on the current scene
context, potentially underestimating the importance of scene dynamics and their
temporal evolution. This limitation restricts the model's ability to make
informed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios. We propose a new
perspective: the future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely
intertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the
vehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds.
Motivated by this bidirectional relationship, we introduce SeerDrive, a novel
end-to-end framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory
planning in a closed-loop manner. Our method first predicts future bird's-eye
view (BEV) representations to anticipate the dynamics of the surrounding scene,
then leverages this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories.
Two key components enable this: (1) future-aware planning, which injects
predicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene
modeling and vehicle planning, which refines both future scene prediction and
trajectory generation through collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments
on the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show that SeerDrive significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于监督扩散的去噪框架，通过对抗性-干净图像配对数据集微调扩散模型，结合提示优化，显著提升多模态大语言模型在图像描述和视觉问答任务中的对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型面临对抗性威胁，现有防御方法如对抗训练计算成本高且仅对已知攻击有效，传统净化方法图像质量下降且泛化能力不足。

Method: 使用监督扩散去噪框架，利用对抗性-干净图像配对数据集微调扩散模型，结合任务特定的方向性指导，并集成提示优化作为补充防御机制。

Result: 在图像描述和视觉问答任务上的实验表明，该方法不仅显著提高了鲁棒性，还对未知对抗攻击表现出强迁移性。

Conclusion: 监督扩散去噪为多模态防御提供了有效解决方案，为多模态大语言模型在现实应用中的可靠安全部署铺平了道路。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal
reasoning by integrating visual and textual modalities. However, their
multimodal nature also exposes them to adversarial threats, where attackers can
perturb either modality or both jointly to induce harmful, misleading, or
policy violating outputs. Existing defense strategies, such as adversarial
training and input purification, face notable limitations: adversarial training
typically improves robustness only against known attacks while incurring high
computational costs, whereas conventional purification approaches often suffer
from degraded image quality and insufficient generalization to complex
multimodal tasks.
  In this work, we focus on defending the visual modality, which frequently
serves as the primary entry point for adversarial manipulation. We propose a
supervised diffusion based denoising framework that leverages paired
adversarial clean image datasets to fine-tune diffusion models with
directional, task specific guidance. Unlike prior unsupervised purification
methods such as DiffPure, our approach achieves higher quality reconstructions
while significantly improving defense robustness in multimodal tasks.
Furthermore, we incorporate prompt optimization as a complementary defense
mechanism, enhancing resistance against diverse and unseen attack strategies.
  Extensive experiments on image captioning and visual question answering
demonstrate that our method not only substantially improves robustness but also
exhibits strong transferability to unknown adversarial attacks. These results
highlight the effectiveness of supervised diffusion based denoising for
multimodal defense, paving the way for more reliable and secure deployment of
MLLMs in real world applications.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) is a critical task in computer vision
that enables models to recognize unseen combinations of known attributes and
objects during inference, addressing the combinatorial challenge of requiring
training data for every possible composition. This is particularly challenging
because the visual appearance of primitives is highly contextual; for example,
``small'' cats appear visually distinct from ``older'' ones, and ``wet'' cars
differ significantly from ``wet'' cats. Effectively modeling this contextuality
and the inherent compositionality is crucial for robust compositional zero-shot
recognition. This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive
survey specifically focused on Compositional Zero-Shot Learning. We
systematically review the state-of-the-art CZSL methods, introducing a taxonomy
grounded in disentanglement, with four families of approaches: no explicit
disentanglement, textual disentanglement, visual disentanglement, and
cross-modal disentanglement. We provide a detailed comparative analysis of
these methods, highlighting their core advantages and limitations in different
problem settings, such as closed-world and open-world CZSL. Finally, we
identify the most significant open challenges and outline promising future
research directions. This survey aims to serve as a foundational resource to
guide and inspire further advancements in this fascinating and important field.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of learning semantically and functionally
meaningful 3D motion priors from real-world videos, in order to enable
prediction of future 3D scene motion from a single input image. We propose a
novel pixel-aligned Motion Map (MoMap) representation for 3D scene motion,
which can be generated from existing generative image models to facilitate
efficient and effective motion prediction. To learn meaningful distributions
over motion, we create a large-scale database of MoMaps from over 50,000 real
videos and train a diffusion model on these representations. Our motion
generation not only synthesizes trajectories in 3D but also suggests a new
pipeline for 2D video synthesis: first generate a MoMap, then warp an image
accordingly and complete the warped point-based renderings. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach generates plausible and semantically
consistent 3D scene motion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纵向多模态数据（包括电子健康记录和连续胸部X光片）对疾病进展建模至关重要，但面临两个关键挑战：连续CXR序列中的冗余（静态解剖区域主导临床意义动态）以及稀疏、不规则成像数据与连续EHR数据之间的时间不对齐。

consecutive CXR sequences, where static anatomical regions dominate over
clinically-meaningful dynamics, and (2) temporal misalignment between sparse,
irregular imaging and continuous EHR data. We introduce $\texttt{DiPro}$, a
novel framework that addresses these challenges through region-aware
disentanglement and multi-timescale alignment. First, we disentangle static
(anatomy) and dynamic (pathology progression) features in sequential CXRs,
prioritizing disease-relevant changes. Second, we hierarchically align these
static and dynamic CXR features with asynchronous EHR data via local (pairwise
interval-level) and global (full-sequence) synchronization to model coherent
progression pathways. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC dataset demonstrate
that $\texttt{DiPro}$ could effectively extract temporal clinical dynamics and
achieve state-of-the-art performance on both disease progression identification
and general ICU prediction tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的少样本学习方法在利用语义知识时容易引入噪声和偏见，因为数据本身较为简单，需要更有效的知识转移机制。

Method: 使用CLIP作为强大教师模型，少样本视觉编码器作为弱学生模型，通过无监督代理任务提取语义对齐的视觉知识；包含协同知识挖掘模块、视觉-语义桥接模块、视觉权重生成器和语义权重重构器。

Result: 在四个少样本学习数据集上的实验表明，即使搭配简单的少样本视觉编码器，SynTrans也显著优于当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: SynTrans框架通过有效转移大型多模态模型的多样化知识，成功解决了少样本学习中的数据稀缺问题，为构建最优多模态少样本学习分类器提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses the challenge of classifying novel classes
with limited training samples. While some methods leverage semantic knowledge
from smaller-scale models to mitigate data scarcity, these approaches often
introduce noise and bias due to the data's inherent simplicity. In this paper,
we propose a novel framework, Synergistic Knowledge Transfer (SynTrans), which
effectively transfers diverse and complementary knowledge from large multimodal
models to empower the off-the-shelf few-shot learner. Specifically, SynTrans
employs CLIP as a robust teacher and uses a few-shot vision encoder as a weak
student, distilling semantic-aligned visual knowledge via an unsupervised proxy
task. Subsequently, a training-free synergistic knowledge mining module
facilitates collaboration among large multimodal models to extract high-quality
semantic knowledge. Building upon this, a visual-semantic bridging module
enables bi-directional knowledge transfer between visual and semantic spaces,
transforming explicit visual and implicit semantic knowledge into
category-specific classifier weights. Finally, SynTrans introduces a visual
weight generator and a semantic weight reconstructor to adaptively construct
optimal multimodal FSL classifiers. Experimental results on four FSL datasets
demonstrate that SynTrans, even when paired with a simple few-shot vision
encoder, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现扩散模型无法通过简单扩大数据集和模型规模来准确生成文本提示中指定的物体数量，提出了通过向噪声先验注入计数感知布局信息的方法来显著提升计数准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的文本到图像生成模型在遵循文本提示中的计数指令方面存在困难，本研究旨在探究扩散模型是否能够通过扩大数据集和模型规模来准确生成指定数量的物体。

Method: 构建了两个互补的合成计数基准数据集，并通过实验验证了缩放假设不成立。提出了一种通过向噪声先验注入计数感知布局信息的方法来控制物体数量。

Result: 提出的方法在GrayCount250数据集上将准确率从20.0%提升到85.3%，在NaturalCount6数据集上从74.8%提升到86.3%，显示出良好的跨设置泛化能力。

Conclusion: 扩散模型倾向于依赖噪声初始化而非文本提示中的明确计数信息，通过注入计数感知布局信息可以有效控制物体数量生成，显著提升计数准确性。

Abstract: Numerosity remains a challenge for state-of-the-art text-to-image generation
models like FLUX and GPT-4o, which often fail to accurately follow counting
instructions in text prompts. In this paper, we aim to study a fundamental yet
often overlooked question: Can diffusion models inherently generate the correct
number of objects specified by a textual prompt simply by scaling up the
dataset and model size? To enable rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we
construct a clean synthetic numerosity benchmark comprising two complementary
datasets: GrayCount250 for controlled scaling studies, and NaturalCount6
featuring complex naturalistic scenes. Second, we empirically show that the
scaling hypothesis does not hold: larger models and datasets alone fail to
improve counting accuracy on our benchmark. Our analysis identifies a key
reason: diffusion models tend to rely heavily on the noise initialization
rather than the explicit numerosity specified in the prompt. We observe that
noise priors exhibit biases toward specific object counts. In addition, we
propose an effective strategy for controlling numerosity by injecting
count-aware layout information into the noise prior. Our method achieves
significant gains, improving accuracy on GrayCount250 from 20.0\% to 85.3\% and
on NaturalCount6 from 74.8\% to 86.3\%, demonstrating effective generalization
across settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: video-SALMONN S是首个能够在固定内存预算下处理3小时视频（1FPS、360p分辨率）的流式音频-视觉大语言模型，通过测试时训练内存模块和提示相关内存读取器实现长视频理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频理解LLM难以扩展处理长视频流，离线方法需要调整帧率，流式方法会丢失信息。需要解决长视频连续处理的内存和效率问题。

Method: 引入测试时训练(TTT)内存模块持续更新token表示来捕获长程依赖，替代token合并；使用提示相关内存读取器从固定大小内存中选择性检索相关内容；采用Hessian-free共轭梯度优化TTT模块。

Result: 在长视频基准测试(Video-MME、LVBench、VideoEvalPro)上，video-SALMONN S能够处理长达3小时、10k帧、100万token的视频，8B参数模型在Video-MME长分割上达到74.2%总体准确率和67.8%的准确率，优于离线和流式基线方法。

Conclusion: video-SALMONN S成功解决了长视频流处理的内存和效率挑战，实现了在固定内存预算下对多小时视频的高质量理解，为未来AI代理的长视频处理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Continuous, high-frame-rate, high-resolution processing of long video streams
is critical for future AI agents, yet current video-understanding LLMs struggle
to scale. Offline, fixed-frame-number methods require the stream length to
adapt frame rates; streaming methods constrain memory by merging or discarding
tokens, losing information. We propose video-SALMONN S, a streaming
audio-visual LLM that, to our knowledge, is the first to process 3-hour videos
at 1 FPS and 360p resolution under a fixed memory budget. Our model introduces
(i) a test-time-training (TTT) memory module that continually updates token
representations to capture long-range dependencies by replacing token merging,
and (ii) a prompt-dependent memory reader that selectively retrieves
context-relevant content from fixed-size memory. The TTT module is optimised
with a Hessian-free conjugate-gradient procedure (TTT_HF) for efficient
adaptation. On long-video benchmarks (Video-MME, LVBench, VideoEvalPro),
video-SALMONN S sustains high-quality understanding on multi-hour videos with
10k frames and 1M tokens. Our 8B-parameter model achieves 74.2% overall and
67.8% on the Video-MME long split, outperforming both offline and streaming
baselines.

Conclusion: 这种非破坏性方法代表了生殖医学的重要进展，能够基于DNA完整性实现实时精子选择，适用于临床诊断和治疗应用。

Abstract: Sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) is a critical parameter in male fertility
assessment that conventional semen analysis fails to evaluate. This study
presents the validation of a novel artificial intelligence (AI) tool designed
to detect SDF through digital analysis of phase contrast microscopy images,
using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
assay as the gold standard reference. Utilising the established link between
sperm morphology and DNA integrity, the present work proposes a morphology
assisted ensemble AI model that combines image processing techniques with
state-of-the-art transformer based machine learning models (GC-ViT) for the
prediction of DNA fragmentation in sperm from phase contrast images. The
ensemble model is benchmarked against a pure transformer `vision' model as well
as a `morphology-only` model. Promising results show the proposed framework is
able to achieve sensitivity of 60\% and specificity of 75\%. This
non-destructive methodology represents a significant advancement in
reproductive medicine by enabling real-time sperm selection based on DNA
integrity for clinical diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多流形证据融合方法MMEFnet，用于融合极化SAR的协方差矩阵和多特征，通过流形学习和证据理论实现更可靠、可解释的分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统融合方法忽略了协方差矩阵和多特征位于不同流形上的几何结构差异，且未考虑不同视图的重要性差异和不确定性，导致预测不可靠。

Method: 将协方差矩阵建模在HPD流形上，多特征建模在Grassmann流形上，构建两个不同的核度量学习网络学习流形表示，然后使用可信多视图证据融合估计置信质量并量化不确定性，最后基于Dempster-Shafer理论融合证据。

Result: 在三个真实世界PolSAR数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性方面持续优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MMEFnet成功将PolSAR流形学习和证据融合集成到统一架构中，实现了更可靠和可解释的分类性能。

Abstract: Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) covariance matrices and their
extracted multi-features - such as scattering angle, entropy, texture, and
boundary descriptors - provide complementary and physically interpretable
information for image classification. Traditional fusion strategies typically
concatenate these features or employ deep learning networks to combine them.
However, the covariance matrices and multi-features, as two complementary
views, lie on different manifolds with distinct geometric structures. Existing
fusion methods also overlook the varying importance of different views and
ignore uncertainty, often leading to unreliable predictions. To address these
issues, we propose a Multiview Manifold Evidential Fusion (MMEFnet) method to
effectively fuse these two views. It gives a new framework to integrate PolSAR
manifold learning and evidence fusion into a unified architecture.
Specifically, covariance matrices are represented on the Hermitian Positive
Definite (HPD) manifold, while multi-features are modeled on the Grassmann
manifold. Two different kernel metric learning networks are constructed to
learn their manifold representations. Subsequently, a trusted multiview
evidence fusion, replacing the conventional softmax classifier, estimates
belief mass and quantifies the uncertainty of each view from the learned deep
features. Finally, a Dempster-Shafer theory-based fusion strategy combines
evidence, enabling a more reliable and interpretable classification. Extensive
experiments on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method consistently outperforms existing approaches in accuracy, robustness,
and interpretability.

TL;DR: CoPRS是一个基于多模态思维链的位置感知模型，通过可微分的热图将语言推理与分割连接起来，提高了可解释性和分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理分割方法要么直接将语言模型的隐藏特征连接到掩码解码器，要么在文本中表示位置，这限制了可解释性和语义细节。

Method: 使用可学习的集中标记聚合图像和推理文本特征生成位置先验热图，通过轻量级解码器解码为精确掩码。

Result: 在RefCOCO系列和ReasonSeg数据集上，CoPRS在可比协议下达到或超过最佳报告指标，在验证和测试集上性能均达到或超过先前最先进水平。

Conclusion: 热图质量强烈影响掩码质量，支持推理输出与下游掩码生成之间的一致性关联，该范式在连接推理和分割方面具有实用性优势。

Abstract: Existing works on reasoning segmentation either connect hidden features from
a language model directly to a mask decoder or represent positions in text,
which limits interpretability and semantic detail. To solve this, we present
CoPRS, a Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT)-based positional perception model
that bridges language reasoning to segmentation through a differentiable and
interpretable positional prior instantiated as a heatmap. By making the
reasoning process clear via MCoT and expressing it as a dense, differentiable
heatmap, this interface enhances interpretability and diagnostic analysis and
yields more concentrated evidence on the target. A learnable concentration
token aggregates features of the image and reasoning text to generate this
positional prior, which is decoded to precise masks through a lightweight
decoder, providing a direct connection between reasoning and segmentation.
Across the RefCOCO series and ReasonSeg, CoPRS matches or surpasses the best
reported metrics on each standard split under comparable protocols, with
performance at or above prior state of the art across both validation and test
partitions. Extensive experiments reveal that the quality of the heatmap
strongly influences the resulting mask quality, supporting a consistent
association between the reasoning output and downstream mask generation.
Collectively, these findings support the utility of this paradigm in bridging
reasoning and segmentation and show advantages in concentration driven by
reasoning and predicting masks more precisely. Code, checkpoints and logs are
released at https://github.com/ZhenyuLU-Heliodore/CoPRS.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PICO是一个新颖的跨模态对齐框架，通过量化特征列表示语义信息的概率来抑制风格干扰，在嵌入交互中实现更好的语义对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跨模态对齐方法假设嵌入仅包含语义信息，忽略了非语义信息（风格变化）的影响，导致信息偏差或丢失。需要分离风格和语义信息，但现有方法基于特征列区分无法表示复杂的耦合关系。

Method: 提出PICO框架，量化每个特征列表示语义信息的概率，并将其作为嵌入交互的权重。采用基于原型迭代构建的方法确保语义概率的可靠性，使用基于性能反馈的加权函数。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型骨干上的广泛实验表明，PICO优于现有最先进方法5.2%-14.1%。

Conclusion: PICO通过有效抑制风格干扰，显著提升了跨模态对齐性能，证明了语义概率量化和原型迭代构建方法的有效性。

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment is an important multi-modal task, aiming to bridge the
semantic gap between different modalities. The most reliable fundamention for
achieving this objective lies in the semantic consistency between matched
pairs. Conventional methods implicitly assume embeddings contain solely
semantic information, ignoring the impact of non-semantic information during
alignment, which inevitably leads to information bias or even loss. These
non-semantic information primarily manifest as stylistic variations in the
data, which we formally define as style information. An intuitive approach is
to separate style from semantics, aligning only the semantic information.
However, most existing methods distinguish them based on feature columns, which
cannot represent the complex coupling relationship between semantic and style
information. In this paper, we propose PICO, a novel framework for suppressing
style interference during embedding interaction. Specifically, we quantify the
probability of each feature column representing semantic information, and
regard it as the weight during the embedding interaction. To ensure the
reliability of the semantic probability, we propose a prototype iterative
construction method. The key operation of this method is a performance
feedback-based weighting function, and we have theoretically proven that the
function can assign higher weight to prototypes that bring higher performance
improvements. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and model backbones
demonstrate the superiority of PICO, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by
5.2\%-14.1\%.

TL;DR: 提出G2L框架，通过知识蒸馏将千亿级病理基础模型的能力转移到仅含15%参数的大型模型上，仅需目标癌症的1000张病理切片即可达到千亿级模型的性能水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 千亿级病理基础模型虽然性能优越，但计算成本过高，难以实际部署应用。需要找到一种参数和数据高效的方法来获得类似性能。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏技术，将千亿级教师模型的能力转移到参数少得多的大型学生模型上，仅需目标癌症的1000张病理切片进行蒸馏训练。

Result: 蒸馏后的大型模型不仅超越了同规模的最先进模型，在某些基准测试中甚至超过了千亿级教师模型和更大规模的模型，并且表现出更高的鲁棒性指数。

Conclusion: 该蒸馏方法是一种参数和数据高效的方式，可以在不产生过高计算负担的情况下，为癌症特定应用实现千亿级性能水平。

Abstract: Recent studies in pathology foundation models have shown that scaling
training data, diversifying cancer types, and increasing model size
consistently improve their performance. However, giga-scale foundation models,
which are trained on hundreds of thousands of slides covering tens of cancer
types and contain billions of parameters, pose significant challenges for
practical use due to their tremendous computational costs in both development
and deployment. In this work, we present a novel strategy, named the G2L
framework, to increase the performance of large-scale foundation models, which
consist of only $15\%$ of the parameters of giga-scale models, to a comparable
performance level of giga-scale models in cancer-specific tasks. Our approach
applies knowledge distillation, transferring the capabilities of a giga-scale
model to a large-scale model, using just 1K pathology slides of a target cancer
(e.g., breast, prostate, etc.). The resulting distilled model not only
outperformed state-of-the-art models of the same size (i.e., large-scale)
across several benchmarks but also, interestingly, surpassed the giga-scale
teacher and huge-scale models in some benchmarks. In addition, the distilled
model exhibited a higher robustness index, indicating improved resilience to
image variations originating from multiple institutions. These findings suggest
that the proposed distillation approach for a large-scale model is a data- and
parameter-efficient way to achieve giga-scale-level performance for
cancer-specific applications without prohibitive computational burden.

TL;DR: BLEnD-Vis是一个多模态、多文化的基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型在日常文化知识方面的鲁棒性，涵盖语言重述和视觉模态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在全球部署，评估其对文化背景知识的理解能力变得至关重要。现有评估主要关注静态回忆或孤立视觉基础，未能检验模型是否具备鲁棒且可迁移的文化理解能力。

Method: 基于BLEnD数据集构建313个文化基础问题模板，涵盖16个地区，生成三种对齐的多选题格式：文本基线、反转文本变体和VQA风格版本，共包含4,916张图像和21,000多个多选题实例。

Result: 发现当前VLM文化知识存在显著脆弱性：模型在语言重述下性能下降，视觉线索虽有助于提升性能，但低跨模态一致性突显了在鲁棒整合文本和视觉理解方面的挑战，特别是对于资源较少地区。

Conclusion: BLEnD-Vis为系统分析文化鲁棒性和多模态基础提供了关键测试平台，揭示了现有模型的局限性，并指导开发更具文化能力的视觉语言模型。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) are deployed globally, their ability to
understand culturally situated knowledge becomes essential. Yet, existing
evaluations largely assess static recall or isolated visual grounding, leaving
unanswered whether VLMs possess robust and transferable cultural understanding.
We introduce BLEnD-Vis, a multimodal, multicultural benchmark designed to
evaluate the robustness of everyday cultural knowledge in VLMs across
linguistic rephrasings and visual modalities. Building on the BLEnD dataset,
BLEnD-Vis constructs 313 culturally grounded question templates spanning 16
regions and generates three aligned multiple-choice formats: (i) a text-only
baseline querying from Region $\to$ Entity, (ii) an inverted text-only variant
(Entity $\to$ Region), and (iii) a VQA-style version of (ii) with generated
images. The resulting benchmark comprises 4,916 images and over 21,000
multiple-choice question (MCQ) instances, validated through human annotation.
BLEnD-Vis reveals significant fragility in current VLM cultural knowledge;
models exhibit performance drops under linguistic rephrasing and, whilst visual
cues often aid performance, low cross-modal consistency highlights challenges
in robustly integrating textual and visual understanding, particularly for
lower-resource regions. BLEnD-Vis thus provides a crucial testbed for
systematically analysing cultural robustness and multimodal grounding, exposing
limitations and guiding the development of more culturally competent VLMs.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of T5 models for Saudi Sign Language
(SSL) translation using a novel dataset. The SSL dataset includes three
challenging testing protocols, enabling comprehensive evaluation across
different scenarios. Additionally, it captures unique SSL characteristics, such
as face coverings, which pose challenges for sign recognition and translation.
In our experiments, we investigate the impact of pre-training on American Sign
Language (ASL) data by comparing T5 models pre-trained on the YouTubeASL
dataset with models trained directly on the SSL dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that pre-training on YouTubeASL significantly improves models'
performance (roughly $3\times$ in BLEU-4), indicating cross-linguistic
transferability in sign language models. Our findings highlight the benefits of
leveraging large-scale ASL data to improve SSL translation and provide insights
into the development of more effective sign language translation systems. Our

<details>

Motivation: 现有MLLM方法缺乏调节联想推理强度的灵活性，限制了模型在事实性和创造性场景间的适应性

Method: FlexAC框架：1) 利用幻觉引导的中间表示编码联想方向；2) 选择高联想实例构建联想引导向量；3) 自适应校准强度平衡创造性和稳定性；4) 引入任务特定联想向量适应多样化任务

Result: 在Creation-MMBench上创造力提升5.8倍，在CHAIR上幻觉率降低29%，优于现有基线方法

Conclusion: FlexAC能够有效调节MLLM的联想推理行为，在保持事实准确性的同时增强创造性能力

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) face an inherent trade-off between
faithfulness and creativity, as different tasks require varying degrees of
associative reasoning. However, existing methods lack the flexibility to
modulate this reasoning strength, limiting MLLMs' adaptability across factual
and creative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose equipping MLLMs with
mechanisms that enable flexible control over associative reasoning. We begin by
investigating the internal mechanisms underlying associative behavior in MLLMs
and find that: (1) middle layers play a pivotal role in shaping model's
associative tendencies, (2) modifying representations in these layers
effectively regulates associative reasoning strength, and (3) hallucinations
can be exploited to derive steering vectors that guide this modulation.
Building on these findings, we introduce Flexible Association Control (FlexAC),
a lightweight and training-free framework for modulating associative behavior
in MLLMs. FlexAC first induces hallucination-guided intermediate
representations to encode associative directions. Then, it selects
high-association instances to construct effective associative steering vectors,
whose strengths are adaptively calibrated to balance creative guidance with
output stability. Finally, recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of
associative reasoning, FlexAC incorporates task-specific associative vectors
derived from a forward pass on a few target-domain samples, enabling models to
follow diverse associative directions and better adapt to creative tasks.
Notably, our method achieves up to a 5.8x improvement in creativity on
Creation-MMBench and a 29% reduction in hallucination rate on CHAIR, surpassing
existing baselines and demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling flexible
control over associative reasoning in MLLMs. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 提出的多模态对比学习方法能有效检测视频中的细粒度教育内容，为儿童教育内容筛选提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The recent growth in the consumption of online media by children during early
childhood necessitates data-driven tools enabling educators to filter out
appropriate educational content for young learners. This paper presents an
approach for detecting educational content in online videos. We focus on two
widely used educational content classes: literacy and math. For each class, we
choose prominent codes (sub-classes) based on the Common Core Standards. For
example, literacy codes include `letter names', `letter sounds', and math codes
include `counting', `sorting'. We pose this as a fine-grained multilabel
classification problem as videos can contain multiple types of educational
content and the content classes can get visually similar (e.g., `letter names'
vs `letter sounds'). We propose a novel class prototypes based supervised
contrastive learning approach that can handle fine-grained samples associated
with multiple labels. We learn a class prototype for each class and a loss
function is employed to minimize the distances between a class prototype and
the samples from the class. Similarly, distances between a class prototype and
the samples from other classes are maximized. As the alignment between visual
and audio cues are crucial for effective comprehension, we consider a
multimodal transformer network to capture the interaction between visual and
audio cues in videos while learning the embedding for videos. For evaluation,
we present a dataset, APPROVE, employing educational videos from YouTube
labeled with fine-grained education classes by education researchers. APPROVE
consists of 193 hours of expert-annotated videos with 19 classes. The proposed
approach outperforms strong baselines on APPROVE and other benchmarks such as
Youtube-8M, and COIN. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: 该研究证明仅通过面部表情的动态成分（独立于静态外貌）就能识别个体身份，在1429人的分类任务中达到61.14%准确率，远高于随机水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索面部表情动态是否包含足够强的个人身份特征，独立于静态面部形状，这对社交感知和临床评估具有重要意义。

Method: 使用FLAME 3D可变形模型分离面部形状和表情动态，仅保留表情和下颌参数，采用Conformer模型和监督对比学习进行身份识别。

Result: 在1429人的分类任务中达到61.14%准确率（458倍于随机水平），并引入漂移噪声比（DNR）量化形状-表情分离的可靠性。

Conclusion: 面部动态携带强烈的个人身份特征，形状估计的不稳定性会影响动态识别性能，这为社交感知和临床评估提供了新视角。

Abstract: This work investigates whether individuals can be identified solely through
the pure dynamical components of their facial expressions, independent of
static facial appearance. We leverage the FLAME 3D morphable model to achieve
explicit disentanglement between facial shape and expression dynamics,
extracting frame-by-frame parameters from conversational videos while retaining
only expression and jaw coefficients. On the CANDOR dataset of 1,429 speakers
in naturalistic conversations, our Conformer model with supervised contrastive
learning achieves 61.14\%accuracy on 1,429-way classification -- 458 times
above chance -- demonstrating that facial dynamics carry strong identity
signatures. We introduce a drift-to-noise ratio (DNR) that quantifies the
reliability of shape expression separation by measuring across-session shape
changes relative to within-session variability. DNR strongly negatively
correlates with recognition performance, confirming that unstable shape
estimation compromises dynamic identification. Our findings reveal
person-specific signatures in conversational facial dynamics, with implications
for social perception and clinical assessment.

Abstract: Effective pneumonia diagnosis is often challenged by the difficulty of
deploying large, computationally expensive deep learning models in
resource-limited settings. This study introduces LightPneumoNet, an efficient,
lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) built from scratch to provide an
accessible and accurate diagnostic solution for pneumonia detection from chest
X-rays. Our model was trained on a public dataset of 5,856 chest X-ray images.
Preprocessing included image resizing to 224x224, grayscale conversion, and
pixel normalization, with data augmentation (rotation, zoom, shear) to prevent
overfitting. The custom architecture features four blocks of stacked
convolutional layers and contains only 388,082 trainable parameters, resulting
in a minimal 1.48 MB memory footprint. On the independent test set, our model
delivered exceptional performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 0.942,
precision of 0.92, and an F1-Score of 0.96. Critically, it obtained a
sensitivity (recall) of 0.99, demonstrating a near-perfect ability to identify
true pneumonia cases and minimize clinically significant false negatives.
Notably, LightPneumoNet achieves this high recall on the same dataset where
existing approaches typically require significantly heavier architectures or
fail to reach comparable sensitivity levels. The model's efficiency enables
deployment on low-cost hardware, making advanced computer-aided diagnosis
accessible in underserved clinics and serving as a reliable second-opinion tool
to improve patient outcomes.

for underrepresented sign languages, such as Nepali Sign Language (NSL), remain
scarce. This study introduces the first benchmark dataset for NSL, consisting
of 36 gesture classes with 1,500 samples per class, designed to capture the

Motivation: 当前医学图像分割方法在结构表示和上下文建模方面存在不足，影响在复杂临床场景中的泛化性能。跳跃连接在融合全局上下文和减少编码器-解码器语义差距方面仍有改进空间。

Method: DTEA模型采用新的跳跃连接框架：STR模块将多尺度语义特征重组为动态超图来建模跨分辨率解剖依赖；EPG模块通过扰动评估通道稳定性，过滤高熵通道以增强临床重要区域的空间注意力。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该框架实现了优越的分割精度，并在各种临床设置中展现出更好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: DTEA模型通过创新的跳跃连接设计有效提升了医学图像分割的结构表示能力和临床泛化性能，为复杂临床场景提供了更可靠的分割解决方案。

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, skip connections are used to merge global
context and reduce the semantic gap between encoder and decoder. Current
methods often struggle with limited structural representation and insufficient
contextual modeling, affecting generalization in complex clinical scenarios. We
propose the DTEA model, featuring a new skip connection framework with the
Semantic Topology Reconfiguration (STR) and Entropic Perturbation Gating (EPG)
modules. STR reorganizes multi-scale semantic features into a dynamic
hypergraph to better model cross-resolution anatomical dependencies, enhancing
structural and semantic representation. EPG assesses channel stability after
perturbation and filters high-entropy channels to emphasize clinically
important regions and improve spatial attention. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets show our framework achieves superior segmentation accuracy
and better generalization across various clinical settings. The code is

Motivation: SEM图像中的尺度条确定目前主要依赖人工操作，既耗时又容易出错，需要自动化解决方案来提高分析效率和准确性。

Method: 四阶段框架：1)自动数据集生成模型合成多样化SEM图像；2)尺度条目标检测；3)混合OCR系统进行信息提取；4)LLM代理分析和验证结果准确性。

Result: 目标检测精度100%，召回率95.8%，mAP@0.5为99.2%；混合OCR系统在Auto-DG数据集上达到89%精度、65%召回率和75% F1分数，显著优于主流独立引擎。

Conclusion: 基于LLM代理的自动化方法显著提升了SEM图像中尺度条检测和提取的效率和准确性，为微观分析提供了有价值的工具，推动了科学成像领域的发展。

Abstract: Microscopic characterizations, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM),
are widely used in scientific research for visualizing and analyzing
microstructures. Determining the scale bars is an important first step of
accurate SEM analysis; however, currently, it mainly relies on manual
operations, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this
issue, we propose a multi-modal and automated scale bar detection and
extraction framework that provides concurrent object detection, text detection
and text recognition with a Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The proposed
framework operates in four phases; i) Automatic Dataset Generation (Auto-DG)
model to synthesize a diverse dataset of SEM images ensuring robust training
and high generalizability of the model, ii) scale bar object detection, iii)
information extraction using a hybrid Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
system with DenseNet and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) based
algorithms, iv) an LLM agent to analyze and verify accuracy of the results. The
proposed model demonstrates a strong performance in object detection and
accurate localization with a precision of 100%, recall of 95.8%, and a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 99.2% at IoU=0.5 and 69.1% at IoU=0.5:0.95. The
hybrid OCR system achieved 89% precision, 65% recall, and a 75% F1 score on the
Auto-DG dataset, significantly outperforming several mainstream standalone
engines, highlighting its reliability for scientific image analysis. The LLM is
introduced as a reasoning engine as well as an intelligent assistant that
suggests follow-up steps and verifies the results. This automated method
powered by an LLM agent significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of
scale bar detection and extraction in SEM images, providing a valuable tool for
microscopic analysis and advancing the field of scientific imaging.

TL;DR: 提出了Class Vectors方法，通过在潜在空间中捕获类别特定的表示调整，实现图像分类器的灵活编辑，包括类别遗忘、分布适应等任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分类器编辑方法要么局限于错误修正，要么需要大量重训练成本，难以实现灵活编辑，特别是在图像分类领域缺乏有效解决方案。

Method: 引入Class Vectors概念，在微调过程中捕获类别特定的表示调整，将类别适应解耦到潜在空间中，支持通过潜在特征引导或权重空间映射来更新决策边界。

Result: Class Vectors能够捕获每个类别的语义偏移，其固有的线性和正交性支持通过简单的类别算术实现高效、灵活的高级概念编辑。

Conclusion: Class Vectors在类别遗忘、环境适应、对抗防御和对抗触发器优化等应用中验证了其有效性，为图像分类器编辑提供了新思路。

Abstract: Image classifiers play a critical role in detecting diseases in medical
imaging and identifying anomalies in manufacturing processes. However, their
predefined behaviors after extensive training make post hoc model editing
difficult, especially when it comes to forgetting specific classes or adapting
to distribution shifts. Existing classifier editing methods either focus
narrowly on correcting errors or incur extensive retraining costs, creating a
bottleneck for flexible editing. Moreover, such editing has seen limited
investigation in image classification. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce Class Vectors, which capture class-specific representation
adjustments during fine-tuning. Whereas task vectors encode task-level changes
in weight space, Class Vectors disentangle each class's adaptation in the
latent space. We show that Class Vectors capture each class's semantic shift
and that classifier editing can be achieved either by steering latent features
along these vectors or by mapping them into weight space to update the decision
boundaries. We also demonstrate that the inherent linearity and orthogonality
of Class Vectors support efficient, flexible, and high-level concept editing
via simple class arithmetic. Finally, we validate their utility in applications
such as unlearning, environmental adaptation, adversarial defense, and
adversarial trigger optimization.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is vital for diagnosis, treatment planning, and
disease monitoring but is challenged by complex factors like ambiguous edges
and background noise. We introduce EEMS, a new model for segmentation,
combining an Edge-Aware Enhancement Unit (EAEU) and a Multi-scale Prompt
Generation Unit (MSPGU). EAEU enhances edge perception via multi-frequency
feature extraction, accurately defining boundaries. MSPGU integrates high-level
semantic and low-level spatial features using a prompt-guided approach,
ensuring precise target localization. The Dual-Source Adaptive Gated Fusion
Unit (DAGFU) merges edge features from EAEU with semantic features from MSPGU,
enhancing segmentation accuracy and robustness. Tests on datasets like ISIC2018
confirm EEMS's superior performance and reliability as a clinical tool.

TL;DR: 提出了DocReward文档奖励模型，专注于评估文档的结构和风格质量，在专业文档生成中超越GPT-4o和GPT-5的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能体工作流主要关注文本质量，忽视了视觉结构和风格对可读性和参与度的重要性，缺乏合适的奖励模型来指导生成具有良好结构和风格的文档。

Method: 构建了包含117K对文档的多领域数据集DocPair，涵盖32个领域和267种文档类型，每对文档内容相同但结构和风格不同。使用Bradley-Terry损失训练DocReward模型来评分文档。

Result: DocReward在准确性上分别比GPT-4o和GPT-5高出30.6和19.4个百分点。在文档生成外部评估中，DocReward的胜率达到60.8%，显著高于GPT-5的37.7%。

Conclusion: DocReward能够有效指导生成智能体产生更受人类偏好的文档，在文档结构和风格评估方面表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic workflows have enabled the automation of tasks
such as professional document generation. However, they primarily focus on
textual quality, neglecting visual structure and style, which are crucial for
readability and engagement. This gap arises mainly from the absence of suitable
reward models to guide agentic workflows toward producing documents with
stronger structural and stylistic quality. To address this, we propose
DocReward, a document reward model that evaluates documents based on their
structure and style. We construct a multi-domain dataset DocPair of 117K paired
documents, covering 32 domains and 267 document types, each including a high-
and low-professionalism document with identical content but different structure
and style. This enables the model to evaluate professionalism comprehensively,
and in a textual-quality-agnostic way. DocReward is trained using the
Bradley-Terry loss to score documents, penalizing predictions that contradict
the annotated ranking. To assess the performance of reward models, we create a
test dataset containing document bundles ranked by well-educated human
evaluators. Notably, DocReward outperforms GPT-4o and GPT-5 in accuracy by 30.6
and 19.4 percentage points, respectively, demonstrating its superiority over
baselines. In an extrinsic evaluation of document generation, DocReward
achieves a significantly higher win rate of 60.8%, compared to GPT-5's 37.7%
win rate, demonstrating its utility in guiding generation agents toward
producing human-preferred documents.

TL;DR: HaDola是一个人类不确定性感知的数据选择和自动标注框架，通过四阶段流程减少对昂贵人工标注的依赖，使视觉语言模型更准确且校准更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据集常存在人类不确定性（HU）——人类标注信心的变化，但标准监督微调仅优化最频繁标签，忽略了HU分布。本文旨在研究HU如何影响SFT以及如何有效利用HU进行训练。

Method: HaDola框架包含四个阶段：区分、自标注、错误触发和训练，通过迭代识别有害样本、优先处理信息性样本，并从少量种子数据（5%数据）进行自举学习。

Result: 在VQAv2和VizWiz数据集上的广泛实验表明，HaDola使用更少的训练数据，持续匹配或优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在SFT中显式建模HU的重要性，表明更好地利用HU比单纯扩大数据集规模更有效。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance in Visual
Question Answering but still rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with
massive labeled datasets, which is costly due to human annotations. Crucially,
real-world datasets often exhibit human uncertainty (HU) -- variation in human
confidence across annotations -- but standard SFT simply optimizes toward the
most frequent label, disregarding HU distributions. This leaves two open
questions: How does HU affect SFT, and how can HU be effectively leveraged in
training? In this work, we first conduct a systematic evaluation of VLMs across
varying HU levels. We have two key findings: (i) surprisingly, high-HU samples
contribute little or even degrade model performance, and (ii) naively training
on the full dataset yields under-calibrated models that fail to capture HU
distributions. Motivated by these findings, we introduce HaDola, a human
uncertainty-aware data selection and automatic labeling framework. HaDola
operates in four stages -- discriminate, self-annotate, error trigger, and
training -- to iteratively identify harmful samples, prioritize informative
ones, and bootstrap from a small seed set (5\% of data). Our approach
substantially reduces reliance on costly HU annotations and makes VLMs more
accurate and better calibrated. Extensive experiments on VQAv2 and VizWiz
datasets demonstrate that HaDola consistently matches or outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines with less training data. Our work highlights the
importance of explicitly modeling HU in SFT, suggesting that better utilization
of HU is more effective than merely scaling up dataset size.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在实际应用中会遇到分布内和分布外数据，其中分布外数据包含协变量偏移和语义偏移，需要同时提升模型对协变量偏移的泛化能力和对语义偏移的检测能力。

Method: 基于视觉语言模态重新对齐时闭集数据能量显著变化的观察，提出ΔEnergy OOD分数，并通过最大化其下界（EBM）构建统一的微调框架。

Result: 在挑战性OOD检测和泛化基准测试中，该方法比现有方法在AUROC指标上提升10%到25%。

Conclusion: ΔEnergy和EBM框架为视觉语言模型提供了同时提升OOD泛化和检测能力的有效解决方案，理论分析和实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Recent approaches for vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
success in achieving fast downstream adaptation. When applied to real-world
downstream tasks, VLMs inevitably encounter both the in-distribution (ID) data
and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. The OOD datasets often include both
covariate shifts (e.g., known classes with changes in image styles) and
semantic shifts (e.g., test-time unseen classes). This highlights the
importance of improving VLMs' generalization ability to covariate-shifted OOD
data, while effectively detecting open-set semantic-shifted OOD classes. In
this paper, inspired by the substantial energy change observed in closed-set
data when re-aligning vision-language modalities (specifically by directly
reducing the maximum cosine similarity to a low value), we introduce a novel
OOD score, named {\Delta}Energy. {\Delta}Energy significantly outperforms the
vanilla energy-based OOD score and provides a more reliable approach for OOD
detection. Furthermore, {\Delta}Energy can simultaneously improve OOD
generalization under covariate shifts, which is achieved by lower-bound
maximization for {\Delta}Energy (termed EBM). EBM is theoretically proven to
not only enhance OOD detection but also yields a domain-consistent Hessian,
which serves as a strong indicator for OOD generalization. Based on this
finding, we developed a unified fine-tuning framework that allows for improving
VLMs' robustness in both OOD generalization and OOD detection. Extensive
experiments on challenging OOD detection and generalization benchmarks
demonstrate the superiority of our method, outperforming recent approaches by
10% to 25% in AUROC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督检测需要大量标注成本，而零样本VLM无需标注但精度较低，需要系统分析两者的成本效益平衡。

Method: 在1000张COCO图像和200张产品图像上进行系统评估，结合总拥有成本建模，建立定量平衡阈值。

Result: YOLO精度91.2% vs Gemini 68.5%，但Gemini在罕见类别可达52.3%精度(YOLO为0%)。YOLO需10800美元标注成本，仅在超过5500万次推理时成本才合理。

Conclusion: 最优架构选择取决于部署量、类别稳定性、预算约束和精度要求，而非单纯技术性能指标。

Abstract: Object detection systems have traditionally relied on supervised learning
with manually annotated bounding boxes, achieving high accuracy at the cost of
substantial annotation investment. The emergence of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) offers an alternative paradigm enabling zero-shot detection through
natural language queries, eliminating annotation requirements but operating
with reduced accuracy. This paper presents the first comprehensive
cost-effectiveness analysis comparing supervised detection (YOLO) with
zero-shot VLM inference (Gemini Flash 2.5). Through systematic evaluation on
1,000 stratified COCO images and 200 diverse product images spanning consumer
electronics and rare categories, combined with detailed Total Cost of Ownership
modeling, we establish quantitative break-even thresholds governing
architecture selection. Our findings reveal that supervised YOLO achieves 91.2%
accuracy versus 68.5% for zero-shot Gemini on standard categories, representing
a 22.7 percentage point advantage that costs $10,800 in annotation for
100-category systems. However, this advantage justifies investment only beyond
55 million inferences, equivalent to 151,000 images daily for one year.
Zero-shot Gemini demonstrates 52.3% accuracy on diverse product categories
(ranging from highly web-prevalent consumer electronics at 75-85% to rare
specialized equipment at 25-40%) where supervised YOLO achieves 0% due to
architectural constraints preventing detection of untrained classes. Cost per
Correct Detection analysis reveals substantially lower per-detection costs for
Gemini ($0.00050 vs $0.143) at 100,000 inferences despite accuracy deficits. We
develop decision frameworks demonstrating that optimal architecture selection
depends critically on deployment volume, category stability, budget
constraints, and accuracy requirements rather than purely technical performance
metrics.

Motivation: 解决基于草图的3D重建挑战，因为草图输入抽象稀疏，缺乏足够的语义和几何信息

Method: 两阶段生成方法：1）通过草图到图像转换进行语义桥接，丰富稀疏草图表示；2）引入对称约束作为几何先验，利用日常物体的结构规律性

Result: 在主流草图数据集上的实验表明，该方法在Chamfer距离、Earth Mover距离和F-Score方面优于现有基于草图的3D重建方法

Conclusion: 提出的语义桥接和对称感知设计有效，能够从抽象稀疏的草图输入生成几何一致的3D形状

Abstract: Sketch-based 3D reconstruction remains a challenging task due to the abstract
and sparse nature of sketch inputs, which often lack sufficient semantic and
geometric information. To address this, we propose Sketch2Symm, a two-stage
generation method that produces geometrically consistent 3D shapes from
sketches. Our approach introduces semantic bridging via sketch-to-image
translation to enrich sparse sketch representations, and incorporates symmetry
constraints as geometric priors to leverage the structural regularity commonly
found in everyday objects. Experiments on mainstream sketch datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing
sketch-based reconstruction methods in terms of Chamfer Distance, Earth Mover's
Distance, and F-Score, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed semantic
bridging and symmetry-aware design.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了SAR影像洪水制图和水深估计的不同预处理、制图及估计方法，通过集成方法分析各步骤选择对结果的影响，发现方法选择和参数调优对洪水范围和水深估计有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成孔径雷达(SAR)影像的洪水制图和水深估计对于校准和验证水力模型至关重要，需要系统评估不同预处理、制图和水深估计方法的选择及其参数对结果的影响。

Method: 使用SAR影像，评估多种预处理（特别是斑点噪声抑制）、洪水制图和水深估计方法，通过集成预处理图像、洪水图和水深场来研究不同步骤方法选择及其超参数的影响，在法国加龙河2019和2021年两次洪水事件上进行验证。

Result: 斑点滤波器的选择会改变洪水范围估计，变化达数平方公里；监督方法优于无监督方法，但调优后的无监督方法（如局部阈值或变化检测）可获得可比结果；预处理和洪水制图步骤的累积不确定性导致水深场估计高度可变。

Conclusion: 必须考虑包含预处理、洪水制图和水深估计方法及其相关超参数的完整处理流程，应采用集成方法并考虑方法不确定性，而非依赖单一配置。洪水制图中方法选择影响最大，水深估计中最有影响的是洪水制图步骤产生的洪水图输入和方法超参数。

Abstract: Flood mapping and water depth estimation from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery are crucial for calibrating and validating hydraulic models. This study
uses SAR imagery to evaluate various preprocessing (especially speckle noise
reduction), flood mapping, and water depth estimation methods. The impact of
the choice of method at different steps and its hyperparameters is studied by
considering an ensemble of preprocessed images, flood maps, and water depth
fields. The evaluation is conducted for two flood events on the Garonne River
(France) in 2019 and 2021, using hydrodynamic simulations and in-situ
observations as reference data. Results show that the choice of speckle filter
alters flood extent estimations with variations of several square kilometers.
Furthermore, the selection and tuning of flood mapping methods also affect
performance. While supervised methods outperformed unsupervised ones, tuned
unsupervised approaches (such as local thresholding or change detection) can
achieve comparable results. The compounded uncertainty from preprocessing and
flood mapping steps also introduces high variability in the water depth field
estimates. This study highlights the importance of considering the entire
processing pipeline, encompassing preprocessing, flood mapping, and water depth
estimation methods and their associated hyperparameters. Rather than relying on
a single configuration, adopting an ensemble approach and accounting for
methodological uncertainty should be privileged. For flood mapping, the method
choice has the most influence. For water depth estimation, the most influential
processing step was the flood map input resulting from the flood mapping step
and the hyperparameters of the methods.

Abstract: Interactive 3D scenes are increasingly vital for embodied intelligence, yet
existing datasets remain limited due to the labor-intensive process of
annotating part segmentation, kinematic types, and motion trajectories. We
present REACT3D, a scalable zero-shot framework that converts static 3D scenes

Abstract: General SVG modeling remains challenging due to fragmented datasets, limited
transferability of methods across tasks, and the difficulty of handling
structural complexity. In response, we leverage the strong transfer and
generalization capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to
achieve unified modeling for SVG understanding, editing, and generation. We
present the InternSVG family, an integrated data-benchmark-model suite. At its
core is SAgoge, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal dataset for SVG
tasks, encompassing both static graphics and dynamic animations. It covers
icons, long-sequence illustrations, scientific diagrams, and dynamic
animations, supporting tasks of varied difficulty levels and providing deeper
hierarchies with richer attributes compared to previous datasets. Based on this
resource, we introduce SArena, a companion benchmark with comprehensive task
definitions and standardized evaluation that aligns with the domains and
difficulty spectrum covered by SAgoge. Building on these foundations, we
propose InternSVG, a unified MLLM for SVG understanding, editing, and
generation with SVG-specific special tokens, subword-based embedding
initialization, and a two-stage training strategy that progresses from short
static SVGs to long-sequence illustrations and complex animations. This unified
formulation induces positive transfer and improves overall performance.
Experiments on SArena and prior benchmark confirm that InternSVG achieves
substantial gains and consistently outperforms leading open and proprietary
counterparts.

Motivation: 现有方法在从H&E染色全切片图像预测空间基因表达时存在两个关键限制：(1)局部特征提取粒度不足，(2)全局空间上下文覆盖不充分。

Method: MMAP框架使用多放大倍率补丁表示捕获细粒度组织学细节，并学习潜在原型嵌入作为切片级信息的紧凑表示。

Result: 在多个评估指标（MAE、MSE、PCC）上，MMAP始终优于所有现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MMAP通过同时解决局部特征粒度和全局上下文覆盖的挑战，显著提升了从组织学图像预测空间基因表达的性能。

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) enables the measurement of gene expression while
preserving spatial information, offering critical insights into tissue
architecture and disease pathology. Recent developments have explored the use
of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) to predict
transcriptome-wide gene expression profiles through deep neural networks. This
task is commonly framed as a regression problem, where each input corresponds
to a localized image patch extracted from the WSI. However, predicting spatial
gene expression from histological images remains a challenging problem due to
the significant modality gap between visual features and molecular signals.
Recent studies have attempted to incorporate both local and global information
into predictive models. Nevertheless, existing methods still suffer from two
key limitations: (1) insufficient granularity in local feature extraction, and
(2) inadequate coverage of global spatial context. In this work, we propose a
novel framework, MMAP (Multi-MAgnification and Prototype-enhanced
architecture), that addresses both challenges simultaneously. To enhance local
feature granularity, MMAP leverages multi-magnification patch representations
that capture fine-grained histological details. To improve global contextual
understanding, it learns a set of latent prototype embeddings that serve as
compact representations of slide-level information. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that MMAP consistently outperforms all existing
state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, including Mean
Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Pearson Correlation
Coefficient (PCC).

Motivation: 现有ControlNet倾向于复制原始训练分布，限制了数据增强效果。需要利用未标记域数据来扩展生成能力，特别是在存在大域偏移的场景中

Method: 在控制机制中引入不确定性概念，结合来自未标记数据集的不确定性控制和来自标记数据集的语义控制，训练能够生成目标域标注数据的ControlNet

Result: 在视网膜OCT图像分割任务中，该方法显著改善了Home-OCT域的分割结果，无需额外监督。在交通场景实验中也验证了有效性

Conclusion: 不确定性引导方法能够实现任意域偏移而无需严格学习图像风格，为跨域分割任务提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Generative Models are a valuable tool for the controlled creation of
high-quality image data. Controlled diffusion models like the ControlNet have
allowed the creation of labeled distributions. Such synthetic datasets can
augment the original training distribution when discriminative models, like
semantic segmentation, are trained. However, this augmentation effect is
limited since ControlNets tend to reproduce the original training distribution.
  This work introduces a method to utilize data from unlabeled domains to train
ControlNets by introducing the concept of uncertainty into the control
mechanism. The uncertainty indicates that a given image was not part of the
training distribution of a downstream task, e.g., segmentation. Thus, two types
of control are engaged in the final network: an uncertainty control from an
unlabeled dataset and a semantic control from the labeled dataset. The
resulting ControlNet allows us to create annotated data with high uncertainty
from the target domain, i.e., synthetic data from the unlabeled distribution
with labels. In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically
high-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth
segmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent
development in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower
quality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation
networks cannot be applied for this type of data. Synthesizing annotated images
from the Home-OCT domain using the proposed approach closes this gap and leads
to significantly improved segmentation results without adding any further
supervision. The advantage of uncertainty-guidance becomes obvious when
compared to style transfer: it enables arbitrary domain shifts without any
strict learning of an image style. This is also demonstrated in a traffic scene
experiment.

Conclusion: 通过直接对齐图像与可泛化的文本表示，可以消除对推理过程的依赖，在保持优异泛化性能的同时显著降低计算开销。

Abstract: Reasoning-based image quality assessment (IQA) models trained through
reinforcement learning (RL) exhibit exceptional generalization, yet the
underlying mechanisms and critical factors driving this capability remain
underexplored in current research. Moreover, despite their superior
performance, these models incur inference energy usage and latency orders of
magnitude higher than their earlier counterparts, restricting their deployment
in specific scenarios. Through extensive experiments, this paper verifies and
elaborates that through RL training, MLLMs leverage their reasoning capability
to convert redundant visual representations into compact, cross-domain aligned
text representations. This conversion is precisely the source of the
generalization exhibited by these reasoning-based IQA models. Building on this
fundamental insight, we propose a novel algorithm, RALI, which employs
contrastive learning to directly align images with these generalizable text
representations learned by RL. This approach eliminates the reliance on
reasoning processes and even obviates the need to load an LLM. For the quality
scoring task, this framework achieves generalization performance comparable to
reasoning-based models while requiring less than 5% of their model parameters
and inference time.

Conclusion: 多视角一致材质推断结合物理环境建模是高斯泼溅中学习准确反射的关键，提出的方法在渲染质量上达到了最优水平。

Abstract: Modeling reflections from 2D images is essential for photorealistic rendering
and novel view synthesis. Recent approaches enhance Gaussian primitives with
reflection-related material attributes to enable physically based rendering
(PBR) with Gaussian Splatting. However, the material inference often lacks
sufficient constraints, especially under limited environment modeling,
resulting in illumination aliasing and reduced generalization. In this work, we
revisit the problem from a multi-view perspective and show that multi-view
consistent material inference with more physically-based environment modeling
is key to learning accurate reflections with Gaussian Splatting. To this end,
we enforce 2D Gaussians to produce multi-view consistent material maps during
deferred shading. We also track photometric variations across views to identify
highly reflective regions, which serve as strong priors for reflection strength
terms. To handle indirect illumination caused by inter-object occlusions, we
further introduce an environment modeling strategy through ray tracing with
2DGS, enabling photorealistic rendering of indirect radiance. Experiments on
widely used benchmarks show that our method faithfully recovers both
illumination and geometry, achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality in
novel views synthesis.

Conclusion: LM-EEC框架通过有效的特征融合和长期记忆管理，成功解决了自我-外部视角对应任务的关键挑战，为智能助手提供精确的视觉指导。

Abstract: Establishing object-level correspondence between egocentric and exocentric
views is essential for intelligent assistants to deliver precise and intuitive
visual guidance. However, this task faces numerous challenges, including
extreme viewpoint variations, occlusions, and the presence of small objects.
Existing approaches usually borrow solutions from video object segmentation
models, but still suffer from the aforementioned challenges. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has shown strong generalization capabilities
and excellent performance in video object segmentation. Yet, when simply
applied to the ego-exo correspondence (EEC) task, SAM 2 encounters severe
difficulties due to ineffective ego-exo feature fusion and limited long-term
memory capacity, especially for long videos. Addressing these problems, we
propose a novel EEC framework based on SAM 2 with long-term memories by
presenting a dual-memory architecture and an adaptive feature routing module
inspired by Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Compared to SAM 2, our approach features
(i) a Memory-View MoE module which consists of a dual-branch routing mechanism
to adaptively assign contribution weights to each expert feature along both
channel and spatial dimensions, and (ii) a dual-memory bank system with a
simple yet effective compression strategy to retain critical long-term
information while eliminating redundancy. In the extensive experiments on the
challenging EgoExo4D benchmark, our method, dubbed LM-EEC, achieves new
state-of-the-art results and significantly outperforms existing methods and the
SAM 2 baseline, showcasing its strong generalization across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) for inland waterways remains challenged by
cooperative system vulnerabilities. This paper presents a novel framework that
fuses high-resolution satellite imagery with vessel trajectory data from the
Automatic Identification System (AIS). This work addresses the limitations of
AIS-based monitoring by leveraging non-cooperative satellite imagery and
implementing a fusion approach that links visual detections with AIS data to
identify dark vessels, validate cooperative traffic, and support advanced MDA.
The You Only Look Once (YOLO) v11 object detection model is used to detect and
characterize vessels and barges by vessel type, barge cover, operational
status, barge count, and direction of travel. An annotated data set of 4,550
instances was developed from $5{,}973~\mathrm{mi}^2$ of Lower Mississippi River
imagery. Evaluation on a held-out test set demonstrated vessel classification
(tugboat, crane barge, bulk carrier, cargo ship, and hopper barge) with an F1
score of 95.8\%; barge cover (covered or uncovered) detection yielded an F1
score of 91.6\%; operational status (staged or in motion) classification
reached an F1 score of 99.4\%. Directionality (upstream, downstream) yielded
93.8\% accuracy. The barge count estimation resulted in a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 2.4 barges. Spatial transferability analysis across geographically
disjoint river segments showed accuracy was maintained as high as 98\%. These
results underscore the viability of integrating non-cooperative satellite
sensing with AIS fusion. This approach enables near-real-time fleet
inventories, supports anomaly detection, and generates high-quality data for
inland waterway surveillance. Future work will expand annotated datasets,
incorporate temporal tracking, and explore multi-modal deep learning to further
enhance operational scalability.

Conclusion: 该方法通过紧密耦合退化建模与融合过程，有效解决了退化图像融合问题，为实际应用提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing Infrared and Visible Image Fusion (IVIF) methods typically assume
high-quality inputs. However, when handing degraded images, these methods
heavily rely on manually switching between different pre-processing techniques.
This decoupling of degradation handling and image fusion leads to significant
performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel VLM-Guided
Degradation-Coupled Fusion network (VGDCFusion), which tightly couples
degradation modeling with the fusion process and leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) for degradation-aware perception and guided suppression.
Specifically, the proposed Specific-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Extractor
(SPDCE) enables modality-specific degradation awareness and establishes a joint
modeling of degradation suppression and intra-modal feature extraction. In
parallel, the Joint-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Fusion (JPDCF) facilitates
cross-modal degradation perception and couples residual degradation filtering
with complementary cross-modal feature fusion. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our VGDCFusion significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art fusion approaches under various degraded image scenarios. Our
code is available at https://github.com/Lmmh058/VGDCFusion.

Conclusion: 通过视图对齐增强3D高斯泼溅的几何表示，有效解决了现有方法在几何准确性和多视图一致性方面的局限性，为高质量的3D重建提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently emerged as an efficient solution for
high-quality and real-time novel view synthesis. However, its capability for
accurate surface reconstruction remains underexplored. Due to the discrete and
unstructured nature of Gaussians, supervision based solely on image rendering
loss often leads to inaccurate geometry and inconsistent multi-view alignment.
In this work, we propose a novel method that enhances the geometric
representation of 3D Gaussians through view alignment (VA). Specifically, we
incorporate edge-aware image cues into the rendering loss to improve surface
boundary delineation. To enforce geometric consistency across views, we
introduce a visibility-aware photometric alignment loss that models occlusions
and encourages accurate spatial relationships among Gaussians. To further
mitigate ambiguities caused by lighting variations, we incorporate normal-based
constraints to refine the spatial orientation of Gaussians and improve local
surface estimation. Additionally, we leverage deep image feature embeddings to
enforce cross-view consistency, enhancing the robustness of the learned
geometry under varying viewpoints and illumination. Extensive experiments on
standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis. The source

Abstract: Surface normal integration is a fundamental problem in computer vision,
dealing with the objective of reconstructing a surface from its corresponding
normal map. Existing approaches require an iterative global optimization to
jointly estimate the depth of each pixel, which scales poorly to larger normal
maps. In this paper, we address this problem by recasting normal integration as
the estimation of relative scales of continuous components. By constraining
pixels belonging to the same component to jointly vary their scale, we
drastically reduce the number of optimization variables. Our framework includes
a heuristic to accurately estimate continuous components from the start, a
strategy to rebalance optimization terms, and a technique to iteratively merge
components to further reduce the size of the problem. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results on the standard normal integration benchmark in as
little as a few seconds and achieves one-order-of-magnitude speedup over
pixel-level approaches on large-resolution normal maps.

comprehension. To overcome these constraints, we introduce Situat3DChange, an
extensive dataset supporting three situation-aware change understanding tasks
following the perception-action model: 121K question-answer pairs, 36K change
descriptions for perception tasks, and 17K rearrangement instructions for the
action task. To construct this large-scale dataset, Situat3DChange leverages
11K human observations of environmental changes to establish shared mental
models and shared situational awareness for human-AI collaboration. These
observations, enriched with egocentric and allocentric perspectives as well as
categorical and coordinate spatial relations, are integrated using an LLM to
support understanding of situated changes. To address the challenge of
comparing pairs of point clouds from the same scene with minor changes, we
propose SCReasoner, an efficient 3D MLLM approach that enables effective point
cloud comparison with minimal parameter overhead and no additional tokens
required for the language decoder. Comprehensive evaluation on Situat3DChange
tasks highlights both the progress and limitations of MLLMs in dynamic scene
and situation understanding. Additional experiments on data scaling and
cross-domain transfer demonstrate the task-agnostic effectiveness of using
Situat3DChange as a training dataset for MLLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了LikePhys方法，通过去噪目标作为ELBO似然替代来评估视频扩散模型中的直觉物理理解，使用有效-无效视频对来区分物理上合理和不可能的视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于难以在生成过程中将物理正确性与视觉外观分离，准确评估视频扩散模型中的直觉物理理解能力仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 引入LikePhys，一种无需训练的方法，通过在精心策划的有效-无效视频对数据集上使用去噪目标作为ELBO似然替代来评估直觉物理。

Result: 在涵盖四个物理领域的十二个场景构建的基准测试中，我们的评估指标PPE与人类偏好表现出强对齐，优于最先进的评估器基线。

Conclusion: 尽管当前模型在处理复杂和混沌动力学方面存在困难，但随着模型容量和推理设置的扩展，物理理解能力显示出明显的改进趋势。

Abstract: Intuitive physics understanding in video diffusion models plays an essential
role in building general-purpose physically plausible world simulators, yet
accurately evaluating such capacity remains a challenging task due to the
difficulty in disentangling physics correctness from visual appearance in
generation. To the end, we introduce LikePhys, a training-free method that
evaluates intuitive physics in video diffusion models by distinguishing
physically valid and impossible videos using the denoising objective as an
ELBO-based likelihood surrogate on a curated dataset of valid-invalid pairs. By
testing on our constructed benchmark of twelve scenarios spanning over four
physics domains, we show that our evaluation metric, Plausibility Preference
Error (PPE), demonstrates strong alignment with human preference, outperforming
state-of-the-art evaluator baselines. We then systematically benchmark
intuitive physics understanding in current video diffusion models. Our study
further analyses how model design and inference settings affect intuitive
physics understanding and highlights domain-specific capacity variations across
physical laws. Empirical results show that, despite current models struggling
with complex and chaotic dynamics, there is a clear trend of improvement in
physics understanding as model capacity and inference settings scale.

TL;DR: 提出了mmWalk多模态数据集和mmWalkVQA基准，用于帮助盲人和低视力人群在复杂环境中的安全导航，通过微调模型在真实数据集上验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决盲人和低视力人群在极端或复杂环境中行走辅助的挑战，由于缺乏整体场景理解能力。

Method: 构建包含120条手动控制、场景分类的行走轨迹的多模态数据集，包含62k同步帧和559k全景图像（RGB、深度、语义模态），并生成包含69k视觉问答三元组的VQA基准。

Conclusion: mmWalk数据集能够有效推进多模态行走辅助技术的发展，为盲人和低视力人群提供更好的导航支持。

Abstract: Walking assistance in extreme or complex environments remains a significant
challenge for people with blindness or low vision (BLV), largely due to the
lack of a holistic scene understanding. Motivated by the real-world needs of
the BLV community, we build mmWalk, a simulated multi-modal dataset that
integrates multi-view sensor and accessibility-oriented features for outdoor
safe navigation. Our dataset comprises 120 manually controlled,
scenario-categorized walking trajectories with 62k synchronized frames. It
contains over 559k panoramic images across RGB, depth, and semantic modalities.
Furthermore, to emphasize real-world relevance, each trajectory involves
outdoor corner cases and accessibility-specific landmarks for BLV users.
Additionally, we generate mmWalkVQA, a VQA benchmark with over 69k visual
question-answer triplets across 9 categories tailored for safe and informed
walking assistance. We evaluate state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
using zero- and few-shot settings and found they struggle with our risk
assessment and navigational tasks. We validate our mmWalk-finetuned model on
real-world datasets and show the effectiveness of our dataset for advancing
multi-modal walking assistance.

TL;DR: 本文研究了DiTs中的大规模激活现象，发现其负责局部细节合成，并提出了一种无需训练的自引导策略DG来增强细节保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiTs内部特征图中存在大规模激活现象，但其功能尚未被充分理解，需要系统研究这些激活在视觉生成中的作用。

Method: 提出Detail Guidance (DG)策略，通过破坏大规模激活构建退化模型，并用其引导原始网络进行更高质量的细节合成，可与CFG无缝集成。

Result: 实验表明DG能持续提升各种预训练DiTs的细粒度细节质量，包括SD3、SD3.5和Flux等模型。

Conclusion: 大规模激活在DiTs中主要控制局部细节合成，DG策略能有效增强细节保真度且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone
for visual generation. Recent observations reveal \emph{Massive Activations}
(MAs) in their internal feature maps, yet their function remains poorly
understood. In this work, we systematically investigate these activations to
elucidate their role in visual generation. We found that these massive
activations occur across all spatial tokens, and their distribution is
modulated by the input timestep embeddings. Importantly, our investigations
further demonstrate that these massive activations play a key role in local
detail synthesis, while having minimal impact on the overall semantic content
of output. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{D}etail
\textbf{G}uidance (\textbf{DG}), a MAs-driven, training-free self-guidance
strategy to explicitly enhance local detail fidelity for DiTs. Specifically, DG
constructs a degraded ``detail-deficient'' model by disrupting MAs and
leverages it to guide the original network toward higher-quality detail
synthesis. Our DG can seamlessly integrate with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG),
enabling further refinements of fine-grained details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our DG consistently improves fine-grained detail quality
across various pre-trained DiTs (\eg, SD3, SD3.5, and Flux).

TL;DR: 提出了ODI-Bench基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型在全方位图像理解上的能力，并开发了Omni-CoT方法来提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在传统2D图像和视频理解上表现优异，但在全方位图像理解方面的能力尚未被充分探索。

Method: 构建包含2,000张全方位图像和4,000个问答对的ODI-Bench基准，涵盖10个细粒度任务；提出Omni-CoT方法，通过思维链推理结合文本和视觉线索来增强模型理解能力。

Result: 实验评估了20个代表性MLLMs，发现现有模型在捕捉全方位图像沉浸式上下文方面仍存在困难；Omni-CoT方法显著提升了模型在全方位环境中的理解能力。

Conclusion: 当前MLLMs在全方位图像理解方面仍有局限，Omni-CoT方法能有效提升模型性能，为未来研究提供了重要基准和方法支持。

Abstract: Omnidirectional images (ODIs) provide full 360x180 view which are widely
adopted in VR, AR and embodied intelligence applications. While multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
conventional 2D image and video understanding benchmarks, their ability to
comprehend the immersive environments captured by ODIs remains largely
unexplored. To address this gap, we first present ODI-Bench, a novel
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for omnidirectional image
understanding. ODI-Bench contains 2,000 high-quality omnidirectional images and
over 4,000 manually annotated question-answering (QA) pairs across 10
fine-grained tasks, covering both general-level and spatial-level ODI
understanding. Extensive experiments are conducted to benchmark 20
representative MLLMs, including proprietary and open-source models, under both
close-ended and open-ended settings. Experimental results reveal that current
MLLMs still struggle to capture the immersive context provided by ODIs. To this
end, we further introduce Omni-CoT, a training-free method which significantly
enhances MLLMs' comprehension ability in the omnidirectional environment
through chain-of-thought reasoning across both textual information and visual
cues. Both the benchmark and the code will be released upon the publication.

TL;DR: 通过系统评估功率律拟合方法，发现XrayCLIP和XraySigLIP等基础模型在胸部X光分类中仅需少量标注样本即可达到良好性能，50个标注病例的学习曲线斜率就能准确预测最终性能平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胸部X光分类通常需要大量标注数据，基础模型可以减少这种依赖，但具体需要多少标注样本仍不明确。

Method: 使用功率律拟合方法预测达到特定ROC-AUC阈值所需的训练样本数量，测试多种病理类型和基础模型。

Result: XrayCLIP和XraySigLIP相比ResNet-50基线模型，用显著更少的标注样本就能达到强性能；仅用50个标注病例的学习曲线斜率就能准确预测最终性能平台。

Conclusion: 研究结果使实践者能够通过仅标注达到目标性能所需的基本样本来最小化标注成本。

Abstract: Chest X-ray classification is vital yet resource-intensive, typically
demanding extensive annotated data for accurate diagnosis. Foundation models
mitigate this reliance, but how many labeled samples are required remains
unclear. We systematically evaluate the use of power-law fits to predict the
training size necessary for specific ROC-AUC thresholds. Testing multiple
pathologies and foundation models, we find XrayCLIP and XraySigLIP achieve
strong performance with significantly fewer labeled examples than a ResNet-50
baseline. Importantly, learning curve slopes from just 50 labeled cases
accurately forecast final performance plateaus. Our results enable
practitioners to minimize annotation costs by labeling only the essential
samples for targeted performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3D点云分割方法局限于单一领域和单一交互方式的问题，避免多数据集训练时的负迁移现象，开发一个通用的交互式分割工具。

Method: 在7个跨域数据集上训练，使用领域自适应归一化防止负迁移；对于文本提示分割，自动生成掩码建议并与CLIP文本查询嵌入匹配，支持全景和开放词汇分割。

Result: 在9个零样本基准测试中，8个空间提示分割任务达到最先进性能；在5个文本提示基准测试中均获得有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: 统一的模型可以匹配或超越专门的领域特定方法，为可扩展的3D标注提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Interactive 3D point cloud segmentation enables efficient annotation of
complex 3D scenes through user-guided prompts. However, current approaches are
typically restricted in scope to a single domain (indoor or outdoor), and to a
single form of user interaction (either spatial clicks or textual prompts).
Moreover, training on multiple datasets often leads to negative transfer,
resulting in domain-specific tools that lack generalizability. To address these
limitations, we present \textbf{SNAP} (\textbf{S}egment a\textbf{N}ything in
\textbf{A}ny \textbf{P}oint cloud), a unified model for interactive 3D
segmentation that supports both point-based and text-based prompts across
diverse domains. Our approach achieves cross-domain generalizability by
training on 7 datasets spanning indoor, outdoor, and aerial environments, while
employing domain-adaptive normalization to prevent negative transfer. For
text-prompted segmentation, we automatically generate mask proposals without
human intervention and match them against CLIP embeddings of textual queries,
enabling both panoptic and open-vocabulary segmentation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SNAP consistently delivers high-quality segmentation results.
We achieve state-of-the-art performance on 8 out of 9 zero-shot benchmarks for
spatial-prompted segmentation and demonstrate competitive results on all 5
text-prompted benchmarks. These results show that a unified model can match or
exceed specialized domain-specific approaches, providing a practical tool for
scalable 3D annotation. Project page is at, https://neu-vi.github.io/SNAP/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的框架，可将任何合成数据集转换为与目标域对齐的高质量训练数据，仅使用不完美的伪标签进行域适应，显著提升语义分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据集与真实图像存在明显差距，特别是在特定目标域（如Cityscapes）中，这种差距限制了模型性能。传统方法需要昂贵的3D建模，违背了低成本标注数据的初衷。

Method: 使用现成的扩散模型，仅通过不完美的伪标签进行目标域适应训练。该方法过滤次优生成结果，纠正图像-标签错位，统一不同数据集的语义标注，将弱合成数据转换为有竞争力的真实域训练集。

Result: 在5个合成数据集和2个真实目标数据集上的实验显示，语义分割性能比最先进的翻译方法提升高达+8.0% mIoU，使快速构建的合成数据集达到与耗时数月精心设计的数据集相当的效果。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了快速语义原型设计与生成模型相结合的价值，为城市场景理解提供了可扩展的高质量训练数据创建范式。

Abstract: Synthetic datasets are widely used for training urban scene recognition
models, but even highly realistic renderings show a noticeable gap to real
imagery. This gap is particularly pronounced when adapting to a specific target
domain, such as Cityscapes, where differences in architecture, vegetation,
object appearance, and camera characteristics limit downstream performance.
Closing this gap with more detailed 3D modelling would require expensive asset
and scene design, defeating the purpose of low-cost labelled data. To address
this, we present a new framework that adapts an off-the-shelf diffusion model
to a target domain using only imperfect pseudo-labels. Once trained, it
generates high-fidelity, target-aligned images from semantic maps of any
synthetic dataset, including low-effort sources created in hours rather than
months. The method filters suboptimal generations, rectifies image-label
misalignments, and standardises semantics across datasets, transforming weak
synthetic data into competitive real-domain training sets. Experiments on five
synthetic datasets and two real target datasets show segmentation gains of up
to +8.0%pt. mIoU over state-of-the-art translation methods, making rapidly
constructed synthetic datasets as effective as high-effort, time-intensive
synthetic datasets requiring extensive manual design. This work highlights a
valuable collaborative paradigm where fast semantic prototyping, combined with
generative models, enables scalable, high-quality training data creation for
urban scene understanding.

Motivation: 基础模型正在改变地球观测领域，但它们在农作物高光谱制图方面的潜力尚未充分探索，需要系统评估不同基础模型在此任务上的表现。

Method: 使用三种基础模型（HyperSigma、DOFA和基于SpectralEarth数据集预训练的Vision Transformer）在训练区域进行微调，并在独立测试区域评估性能，采用总体准确率、平均准确率和F1分数作为评价指标。

Conclusion: 模型架构对于跨地理区域和传感器平台的强泛化能力至关重要，这些结果为操作化高光谱农作物制图提供了系统评估，并指明了未来模型开发的方向。

Abstract: Foundation models are transforming Earth observation, but their potential for
hyperspectral crop mapping remains underexplored. This study benchmarks three
foundation models for cereal crop mapping using hyperspectral imagery:
HyperSigma, DOFA, and Vision Transformers pre-trained on the SpectralEarth
dataset (a large multitemporal hyperspectral archive). Models were fine-tuned
on manually labeled data from a training region and evaluated on an independent
test region. Performance was measured with overall accuracy (OA), average
accuracy (AA), and F1-score. HyperSigma achieved an OA of 34.5% (+/- 1.8%),
DOFA reached 62.6% (+/- 3.5%), and the SpectralEarth model achieved an OA of
93.5% (+/- 0.8%). A compact SpectralEarth variant trained from scratch achieved
91%, highlighting the importance of model architecture for strong
generalization across geographic regions and sensor platforms. These results
provide a systematic evaluation of foundation models for operational
hyperspectral crop mapping and outline directions for future model development.

TL;DR: MS-Mix是一种情感感知的多模态数据增强框架，通过情感感知样本选择、情感强度引导的混合比例计算和情感对齐损失，解决了传统Mixup在多模态情感分析中导致的标签模糊和语义不一致问题。

Result: 在三个基准数据集和六个最先进骨干网络上的广泛实验表明，MS-Mix始终优于现有方法，为鲁棒的多模态情感增强建立了新标准。

Conclusion: MS-Mix通过情感感知的混合机制有效解决了多模态情感分析中的数据增强问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) aims to identify and interpret human
emotions by integrating information from heterogeneous data sources such as
text, video, and audio. While deep learning models have advanced in network
architecture design, they remain heavily limited by scarce multimodal annotated
data. Although Mixup-based augmentation improves generalization in unimodal
tasks, its direct application to MSA introduces critical challenges: random
mixing often amplifies label ambiguity and semantic inconsistency due to the
lack of emotion-aware mixing mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose
MS-Mix, an adaptive, emotion-sensitive augmentation framework that
automatically optimizes sample mixing in multimodal settings. The key
components of MS-Mix include: (1) a Sentiment-Aware Sample Selection (SASS)
strategy that effectively prevents semantic confusion caused by mixing samples
with contradictory emotions. (2) a Sentiment Intensity Guided (SIG) module
using multi-head self-attention to compute modality-specific mixing ratios
dynamically based on their respective emotional intensities. (3) a Sentiment
Alignment Loss (SAL) that aligns the prediction distributions across
modalities, and incorporates the Kullback-Leibler-based loss as an additional
regularization term to train the emotion intensity predictor and the backbone
network jointly. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets with six
state-of-the-art backbones confirm that MS-Mix consistently outperforms
existing methods, establishing a new standard for robust multimodal sentiment
augmentation. The source code is available at:

Motivation: 传统场景坐标回归方法在训练视图和查询图像成像条件差异较大时泛化能力不足，因为其训练目标本质上是对训练视图的过拟合

Method: 将坐标回归器和地图表示分离为通用变换器和场景特定地图代码，在数万个场景上预训练变换器，使其能够从映射图像泛化到未见过的查询图像

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的重定位数据集上，ACE-G方法显著提高了鲁棒性，同时保持了有吸引力的计算效率

Conclusion: 通过分离坐标回归器和地图表示，并利用大规模预训练，可以显著提升场景坐标回归方法的泛化能力

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) has established itself as a promising
learning-based approach to visual relocalization. After mere minutes of
scene-specific training, SCR models estimate camera poses of query images with
high accuracy. Still, SCR methods fall short of the generalization capabilities
of more classical feature-matching approaches. When imaging conditions of query
images, such as lighting or viewpoint, are too different from the training
views, SCR models fail. Failing to generalize is an inherent limitation of
previous SCR frameworks, since their training objective is to encode the
training views in the weights of the coordinate regressor itself. The regressor
essentially overfits to the training views, by design. We propose to separate
the coordinate regressor and the map representation into a generic transformer
and a scene-specific map code. This separation allows us to pre-train the
transformer on tens of thousands of scenes. More importantly, it allows us to
train the transformer to generalize from mapping images to unseen query images
during pre-training. We demonstrate on multiple challenging relocalization
datasets that our method, ACE-G, leads to significantly increased robustness
while keeping the computational footprint attractive.

TL;DR: ExpVid是首个专门评估多模态大语言模型在科学实验视频理解能力上的基准测试，包含细粒度感知、程序理解和科学推理三个层次的任务，揭示了现有模型在科学实验理解方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试忽视了真实实验室工作的细粒度和长期性特点，特别是湿实验室环境，无法准确评估多模态大语言模型在科学实验理解方面的真实能力。

Method: 从同行评审的视频出版物中收集数据，构建包含三个层次任务的新基准：细粒度感知（工具、材料、动作）、程序理解（步骤顺序和完整性）、科学推理（连接实验与发表结论）。采用以视觉为中心的标注流程，结合自动生成和多学科专家验证。

Result: 评估了19个领先的多模态大语言模型，发现它们在粗粒度识别方面表现良好，但在区分细粒度细节、跟踪状态变化以及将实验程序与科学结果联系起来方面表现不佳。专有模型和开源模型之间存在显著性能差距，特别是在高阶推理方面。

Conclusion: ExpVid不仅提供了诊断工具，还为开发能够在科学实验中成为可信赖伙伴的多模态大语言模型制定了路线图，揭示了当前模型在科学实验理解方面的局限性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold promise for accelerating
scientific discovery by interpreting complex experimental procedures. However,
their true capabilities are poorly understood, as existing benchmarks neglect
the fine-grained and long-horizon nature of authentic laboratory work,
especially in wet-lab settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce ExpVid, the
first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs on scientific
experiment videos. Curated from peer-reviewed video publications, ExpVid
features a new three-level task hierarchy that mirrors the scientific process:
(1) Fine-grained Perception of tools, materials, and actions; (2) Procedural
Understanding of step order and completeness; and (3) Scientific Reasoning that
connects the full experiment to its published conclusions. Our vision-centric
annotation pipeline, combining automated generation with multi-disciplinary
expert validation, ensures that tasks require visual grounding. We evaluate 19
leading MLLMs on ExpVid and find that while they excel at coarse-grained
recognition, they struggle with disambiguating fine details, tracking state
changes over time, and linking experimental procedures to scientific outcomes.
Our results reveal a notable performance gap between proprietary and
open-source models, particularly in high-order reasoning. ExpVid not only
provides a diagnostic tool but also charts a roadmap for developing MLLMs
capable of becoming trustworthy partners in scientific experimentation.

Motivation: 现有照片增强方法要么性能强大但无法在边缘设备部署，要么计算效率高但实际应用性能不足，需要平衡性能与效率。

Method: 使用图像自适应的3D LUT处理全局色调特征，结合空间频率变换器权重预测器提取权重，并应用局部拉普拉斯滤波器细化高频细节。

Conclusion: LLF-LUT++成功实现了高性能与高效率的平衡，为高分辨率图像增强提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Photo enhancement plays a crucial role in augmenting the visual aesthetics of
a photograph. In recent years, photo enhancement methods have either focused on
enhancement performance, producing powerful models that cannot be deployed on
edge devices, or prioritized computational efficiency, resulting in inadequate
performance for real-world applications. To this end, this paper introduces a
pyramid network called LLF-LUT++, which integrates global and local operators
through closed-form Laplacian pyramid decomposition and reconstruction. This
approach enables fast processing of high-resolution images while also achieving
excellent performance. Specifically, we utilize an image-adaptive 3D LUT that
capitalizes on the global tonal characteristics of downsampled images, while
incorporating two distinct weight fusion strategies to achieve coarse global
image enhancement. To implement this strategy, we designed a spatial-frequency
transformer weight predictor that effectively extracts the desired distinct
weights by leveraging frequency features. Additionally, we apply local
Laplacian filters to adaptively refine edge details in high-frequency
components. After meticulously redesigning the network structure and
transformer model, LLF-LUT++ not only achieves a 2.64 dB improvement in PSNR on
the HDR+ dataset, but also further reduces runtime, with 4K resolution images
processed in just 13 ms on a single GPU. Extensive experimental results on two
benchmark datasets further show that the proposed approach performs favorably
compared to state-of-the-art methods. The source code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/fengzhang427/LLF-LUT.

with vision language and reasoning language models. We assess our method using
GPT-4V and GPT-4o, evaluating it on the CADPrompt benchmark dataset and
comparing it to prior methods. Additionally, we introduce two new metrics based
on topological properties defined by the Euler characteristic, which capture a
form of semantic similarity between 3D objects. Our results demonstrate that
EvoCAD outperforms previous approaches on multiple metrics, particularly in
generating topologically correct objects, which can be efficiently evaluated
using our two novel metrics that complement existing spatial metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NV3D是一种3D物体检测模型，通过从体素邻居提取法向量特征，结合密度采样和FOV感知采样策略，在保持性能的同时减少55%的数据量，在KITTI数据集上实现了优于基线的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态方法面临特征对齐挑战，而局部特征提取方法对于复杂的3D物体检测任务可能过于简化。需要一种能够有效利用局部几何信息的方法来提升检测性能。

Method: 提出NV3D模型，使用KNN和PCA计算每个体素的法向量作为局部特征，采用法向量密度采样和FOV感知采样策略减少数据量，并应用元素级注意力融合机制。

Result: 在KITTI验证集上，无采样的NV3D在汽车和骑车人检测上分别达到86.60%和80.18% mAP，比基线Voxel R-CNN分别提升2.61%和4.23%。使用采样后仍保持85.54% mAP，优于基线1.56%。

Conclusion: 法向量特征能够有效捕捉表面几何信息，结合采样策略可在显著减少数据量的同时保持检测性能，特别适用于具有明显空间形状的物体检测。

Abstract: Recent studies in 3D object detection for autonomous vehicles aim to enrich
features through the utilization of multi-modal setups or the extraction of
local patterns within LiDAR point clouds. However, multi-modal methods face
significant challenges in feature alignment, and gaining features locally can
be oversimplified for complex 3D object detection tasks. In this paper, we
propose a novel model, NV3D, which utilizes local features acquired from voxel
neighbors, as normal vectors computed per voxel basis using K-nearest neighbors
(KNN) and principal component analysis (PCA). This informative feature enables
NV3D to determine the relationship between the surface and pertinent target
entities, including cars, pedestrians, or cyclists. During the normal vector
extraction process, NV3D offers two distinct sampling strategies: normal vector
density-based sampling and FOV-aware bin-based sampling, allowing elimination
of up to 55% of data while maintaining performance. In addition, we applied
element-wise attention fusion, which accepts voxel features as the query and
value and normal vector features as the key, similar to the attention
mechanism. Our method is trained on the KITTI dataset and has demonstrated
superior performance in car and cyclist detection owing to their spatial
shapes. In the validation set, NV3D without sampling achieves 86.60% and 80.18%
mean Average Precision (mAP), greater than the baseline Voxel R-CNN by 2.61%
and 4.23% mAP, respectively. With both samplings, NV3D achieves 85.54% mAP in
car detection, exceeding the baseline by 1.56% mAP, despite roughly 55% of
voxels being filtered out.

Abstract: Instruction-guided video editing has emerged as a rapidly advancing research
direction, offering new opportunities for intuitive content transformation
while also posing significant challenges for systematic evaluation. Existing
video editing benchmarks fail to support the evaluation of instruction-guided
video editing adequately and further suffer from limited source diversity,
narrow task coverage and incomplete evaluation metrics. To address the above
limitations, we introduce IVEBench, a modern benchmark suite specifically
designed for instruction-guided video editing assessment. IVEBench comprises a
diverse database of 600 high-quality source videos, spanning seven semantic
dimensions, and covering video lengths ranging from 32 to 1,024 frames. It
further includes 8 categories of editing tasks with 35 subcategories, whose
prompts are generated and refined through large language models and expert
review. Crucially, IVEBench establishes a three-dimensional evaluation protocol
encompassing video quality, instruction compliance and video fidelity,
integrating both traditional metrics and multimodal large language model-based
assessments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IVEBench in
benchmarking state-of-the-art instruction-guided video editing methods, showing
its ability to provide comprehensive and human-aligned evaluation outcomes.

TL;DR: PhySIC是一个从单张RGB图像重建物理合理的人体-场景交互和接触的框架，能够恢复度量一致的SMPL-X人体网格、密集场景表面和顶点级接触图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从单张图像重建度量准确的人体和周围场景对于虚拟现实、机器人和全面3D场景理解至关重要，但现有方法在深度模糊、遮挡和物理不一致接触方面存在困难。

Method: 从粗略的单目深度和人体估计开始，进行遮挡感知修复，融合可见深度与未缩放几何体构建稳健度量支架，合成缺失支撑表面，并通过置信度加权优化联合执行深度对齐、接触先验、避免相互穿透和2D重投影一致性。

Conclusion: 通过将单张图像转换为物理合理的3D人体-场景对，PhySIC推进了可扩展的3D场景理解。

Abstract: Reconstructing metrically accurate humans and their surrounding scenes from a
single image is crucial for virtual reality, robotics, and comprehensive 3D
scene understanding. However, existing methods struggle with depth ambiguity,
occlusions, and physically inconsistent contacts. To address these challenges,
we introduce PhySIC, a framework for physically plausible Human-Scene
Interaction and Contact reconstruction. PhySIC recovers metrically consistent
SMPL-X human meshes, dense scene surfaces, and vertex-level contact maps within
a shared coordinate frame from a single RGB image. Starting from coarse
monocular depth and body estimates, PhySIC performs occlusion-aware inpainting,
fuses visible depth with unscaled geometry for a robust metric scaffold, and
synthesizes missing support surfaces like floors. A confidence-weighted
optimization refines body pose, camera parameters, and global scale by jointly
enforcing depth alignment, contact priors, interpenetration avoidance, and 2D
reprojection consistency. Explicit occlusion masking safeguards invisible
regions against implausible configurations. PhySIC is efficient, requiring only
9 seconds for joint human-scene optimization and under 27 seconds end-to-end.
It naturally handles multiple humans, enabling reconstruction of diverse
interactions. Empirically, PhySIC outperforms single-image baselines, reducing
mean per-vertex scene error from 641 mm to 227 mm, halving PA-MPJPE to 42 mm,
and improving contact F1 from 0.09 to 0.51. Qualitative results show realistic
foot-floor interactions, natural seating, and plausible reconstructions of
heavily occluded furniture. By converting a single image into a physically
plausible 3D human-scene pair, PhySIC advances scalable 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Generating realistic and controllable 3D human avatars is a long-standing
challenge, particularly when covering broad attribute ranges such as ethnicity,
age, clothing styles, and detailed body shapes. Capturing and annotating
large-scale human datasets for training generative models is prohibitively
expensive and limited in scale and diversity. The central question we address
in this paper is: Can existing foundation models be distilled to generate
theoretically unbounded, richly annotated 3D human data? We introduce
InfiniHuman, a framework that synergistically distills these models to produce
richly annotated human data at minimal cost and with theoretically unlimited
scalability. We propose InfiniHumanData, a fully automatic pipeline that
leverages vision-language and image generation models to create a large-scale
multi-modal dataset. User study shows our automatically generated identities
are undistinguishable from scan renderings. InfiniHumanData contains 111K
identities spanning unprecedented diversity. Each identity is annotated with
multi-granularity text descriptions, multi-view RGB images, detailed clothing
images, and SMPL body-shape parameters. Building on this dataset, we propose
InfiniHumanGen, a diffusion-based generative pipeline conditioned on text, body
shape, and clothing assets. InfiniHumanGen enables fast, realistic, and
precisely controllable avatar generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in visual quality,
generation speed, and controllability. Our approach enables high-quality avatar
generation with fine-grained control at effectively unbounded scale through a
practical and affordable solution. We will publicly release the automatic data
generation pipeline, the comprehensive InfiniHumanData dataset, and the
InfiniHumanGen models at https://yuxuan-xue.com/infini-human.

Motivation: 现有自动概念发现方法提取的概念往往与模型真实决策过程不一致，损害了解释的忠实性。

Result: 在ImageNet、COCO和CelebA数据集上的系统评估表明，FACE在忠实性和稀疏性指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FACE框架通过理论保证和实验验证，能够提取与模型决策过程更一致的概念，提供更忠实的解释。

Abstract: Interpreting deep neural networks through concept-based explanations offers a
bridge between low-level features and high-level human-understandable
semantics. However, existing automatic concept discovery methods often fail to
align these extracted concepts with the model's true decision-making process,
thereby compromising explanation faithfulness. In this work, we propose FACE
(Faithful Automatic Concept Extraction), a novel framework that augments
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
regularization term to ensure alignment between the model's original and
concept-based predictions. Unlike prior methods that operate solely on encoder
activations, FACE incorporates classifier supervision during concept learning,
enforcing predictive consistency and enabling faithful explanations. We provide
theoretical guarantees showing that minimizing the KL divergence bounds the
deviation in predictive distributions, thereby promoting faithful local
linearity in the learned concept space. Systematic evaluations on ImageNet,
COCO, and CelebA datasets demonstrate that FACE outperforms existing methods
across faithfulness and sparsity metrics.

Conclusion: 该框架为机器人和具身AI中的开放集6D理解设立了新标准，仅使用合成数据训练即可实现优秀的跨类别泛化性能。

Abstract: Estimating an object's 6D pose, size, and shape from visual input is a
fundamental problem in computer vision, with critical applications in robotic
grasping and manipulation. Existing methods either rely on object-specific
priors such as CAD models or templates, or suffer from limited generalization
across categories due to pose-shape entanglement and multi-stage pipelines. In
this work, we propose a unified, category-agnostic framework that
simultaneously predicts 6D pose, size, and dense shape from a single RGB-D
image, without requiring templates, CAD models, or category labels at test
time. Our model fuses dense 2D features from vision foundation models with
partial 3D point clouds using a Transformer encoder enhanced by a
Mixture-of-Experts, and employs parallel decoders for pose-size estimation and
shape reconstruction, achieving real-time inference at 28 FPS. Trained solely
on synthetic data from 149 categories in the SOPE dataset, our framework is
evaluated on four diverse benchmarks SOPE, ROPE, ObjaversePose, and HANDAL,
spanning over 300 categories. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on seen
categories while demonstrating remarkably strong zero-shot generalization to
unseen real-world objects, establishing a new standard for open-set 6D
understanding in robotics and embodied AI.

TL;DR: 本文提出用表示自编码器（RAE）替代传统VAE作为扩散变换器（DiT）的潜在空间编码器，解决了VAE的架构过时、潜在空间维度低和表示质量差等问题，并在ImageNet上取得了优异的生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DiT使用的VAE编码器存在多个局限：架构过时、潜在空间维度低限制信息容量、纯重建训练导致表示质量差，最终影响生成质量。需要更先进的编码器来提升扩散变换器的性能。

Method: 使用预训练表示编码器（如DINO、SigLIP、MAE）配合训练的解码器构建表示自编码器（RAE），分析高维潜在空间中的扩散困难并提出理论解决方案，采用轻量级宽DDT头实现高效扩散。

Result: 在ImageNet上取得显著成果：256×256无引导FID为1.51，256×256和512×512有引导FID均为1.13，收敛更快且无需辅助表示对齐损失。

Conclusion: RAE相比传统VAE具有明显优势，应该成为扩散变换器训练的新标准方法。

Abstract: Latent generative modeling, where a pretrained autoencoder maps pixels into a
latent space for the diffusion process, has become the standard strategy for
Diffusion Transformers (DiT); however, the autoencoder component has barely
evolved. Most DiTs continue to rely on the original VAE encoder, which
introduces several limitations: outdated backbones that compromise
architectural simplicity, low-dimensional latent spaces that restrict
information capacity, and weak representations that result from purely
reconstruction-based training and ultimately limit generative quality. In this
work, we explore replacing the VAE with pretrained representation encoders
(e.g., DINO, SigLIP, MAE) paired with trained decoders, forming what we term
Representation Autoencoders (RAEs). These models provide both high-quality
reconstructions and semantically rich latent spaces, while allowing for a
scalable transformer-based architecture. Since these latent spaces are
typically high-dimensional, a key challenge is enabling diffusion transformers
to operate effectively within them. We analyze the sources of this difficulty,
propose theoretically motivated solutions, and validate them empirically. Our
approach achieves faster convergence without auxiliary representation alignment
losses. Using a DiT variant equipped with a lightweight, wide DDT head, we
achieve strong image generation results on ImageNet: 1.51 FID at 256x256 (no
guidance) and 1.13 at both 256x256 and 512x512 (with guidance). RAE offers
clear advantages and should be the new default for diffusion transformer
training.

Conclusion: 这种混合方法在图像分类中具有更高效和鲁棒的潜力，能提供更好的不确定性量化能力。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been established as the main
workhorse in image data processing; nonetheless, they require large amounts of
data to train, often produce overconfident predictions, and frequently lack the
ability to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions. To address these
concerns, we propose a new Bayesian topological CNN that promotes a novel
interplay between topology-aware learning and Bayesian sampling. Specifically,
it utilizes information from important manifolds to accelerate training while
reducing calibration error by placing prior distributions on network parameters
and properly learning appropriate posteriors. One important contribution of our
work is the inclusion of a consistency condition in the learning cost, which
can effectively modify the prior distributions to improve the performance of
our novel network architecture. We evaluate the model on benchmark image
classification datasets and demonstrate its superiority over conventional CNNs,
Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), and topological CNNs. In particular, we supply
evidence that our method provides an advantage in situations where training
data is limited or corrupted. Furthermore, we show that the new model allows
for better uncertainty quantification than standard BNNs since it can more
readily identify examples of out-of-distribution data on which it has not been
trained. Our results highlight the potential of our novel hybrid approach for
more efficient and robust image classification.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注模型设计，而全景图像生成质量不佳的主要原因是缺乏大规模、高质量的真实世界全景数据。

Method: 在图像级别通过透视图像引导和全景细化引入跨域知识；在token级别应用混合监督，包括循环填充、偏航损失和立方体损失等模块。

Result: 在文本到全景、修复和外延任务上的广泛实验表明，该方法在11个定量指标上实现了更好的边界一致性和图像保真度。

Conclusion: DiT360通过数据中心的视角和混合训练策略，有效提升了全景图像生成的质量和几何保真度。

Abstract: In this work, we propose DiT360, a DiT-based framework that performs hybrid
training on perspective and panoramic data for panoramic image generation. For
the issues of maintaining geometric fidelity and photorealism in generation
quality, we attribute the main reason to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
real-world panoramic data, where such a data-centric view differs from prior
methods that focus on model design. Basically, DiT360 has several key modules
for inter-domain transformation and intra-domain augmentation, applied at both
the pre-VAE image level and the post-VAE token level. At the image level, we
incorporate cross-domain knowledge through perspective image guidance and
panoramic refinement, which enhance perceptual quality while regularizing
diversity and photorealism. At the token level, hybrid supervision is applied
across multiple modules, which include circular padding for boundary
continuity, yaw loss for rotational robustness, and cube loss for distortion
awareness. Extensive experiments on text-to-panorama, inpainting, and
outpainting tasks demonstrate that our method achieves better boundary
consistency and image fidelity across eleven quantitative metrics. Our code is

TL;DR: 使用预训练的视频扩散模型进行零样本点跟踪，通过在查询点放置彩色标记并重新生成视频来传播标记，从而追踪点的轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跟踪器和视频生成器解决密切相关的问题：前者分析运动，后者合成运动。这种联系使得预训练的视频扩散模型能够通过视觉标记点来执行零样本点跟踪。

Method: 在查询点放置独特颜色的标记，然后从中等噪声级别重新生成视频的其余部分，使标记在帧间传播。使用未编辑的初始帧作为负提示，确保标记在反事实生成中保持可见。

Result: 通过多个图像条件视频扩散模型的实验发现，这种"涌现"跟踪优于先前的零样本方法，能够持续通过遮挡，性能与专门的自监督模型相当。

Conclusion: 预训练的视频扩散模型能够有效执行零样本点跟踪，展示了跟踪和视频生成任务之间的紧密联系，为点跟踪提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Trackers and video generators solve closely related problems: the former
analyze motion, while the latter synthesize it. We show that this connection
enables pretrained video diffusion models to perform zero-shot point tracking
by simply prompting them to visually mark points as they move over time. We
place a distinctively colored marker at the query point, then regenerate the
rest of the video from an intermediate noise level. This propagates the marker
across frames, tracing the point's trajectory. To ensure that the marker
remains visible in this counterfactual generation, despite such markers being
unlikely in natural videos, we use the unedited initial frame as a negative
prompt. Through experiments with multiple image-conditioned video diffusion
models, we find that these "emergent" tracks outperform those of prior
zero-shot methods and persist through occlusions, often obtaining performance
that is competitive with specialized self-supervised models.

Conclusion: Ev4DGS证明了仅从事件流学习非刚性物体新视角渲染的可行性，为事件相机在动态场景中的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Event cameras offer various advantages for novel view rendering compared to
synchronously operating RGB cameras, and efficient event-based techniques
supporting rigid scenes have been recently demonstrated in the literature. In
the case of non-rigid objects, however, existing approaches additionally
require sparse RGB inputs, which can be a substantial practical limitation; it
remains unknown if similar models could be learned from event streams only.
This paper sheds light on this challenging open question and introduces Ev4DGS,
i.e., the first approach for novel view rendering of non-rigidly deforming
objects in the explicit observation space (i.e., as RGB or greyscale images)
from monocular event streams. Our method regresses a deformable 3D Gaussian
Splatting representation through 1) a loss relating the outputs of the
estimated model with the 2D event observation space, and 2) a coarse 3D
deformation model trained from binary masks generated from events. We perform
experimental comparisons on existing synthetic and newly recorded real datasets
with non-rigid objects. The results demonstrate the validity of Ev4DGS and its
superior performance compared to multiple naive baselines that can be applied
in our setting. We will release our models and the datasets used in the
evaluation for research purposes; see the project webpage:

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models
(VLMs) have shown significant progress in mathematical reasoning, yet they
still face a critical bottleneck with problems requiring visual assistance,
such as drawing auxiliary lines or plotting functions to solve the problems.
Most LLMs and VLMs are constrained to text-only reasoning chains, while
multimodal unified models that can generate interleaved text and images lack
the necessary precision and controllability for such tasks. To address this, we
propose CodePlot-CoT, a code-driven Chain-of-Thought paradigm for "thinking
with images" in mathematics. Our approach leverages the VLM to generate text
reasoning as well as executable plotting code, which is then rendered into
images as "visual thought", to solve mathematical problems. To achieve this, we
first construct Math-VR, the first large-scale, bilingual dataset and benchmark
for Mathematics problems with Visual Reasoning, comprising 178K samples.
Second, to create high-quality training data, we develop a state-of-the-art
image-to-code converter specialized for parsing complex mathematical figures
into codes. Finally, using these training data, we train the CodePlot-CoT model
for solving mathematical problems. Experimental results show that our model
achieves up to 21% increase over base model on our new benchmark, fully
validating the efficacy of our proposed code-driven reasoning paradigm. Our
work opens a new direction for multimodal mathematical reasoning and provides
the community with the first large-scale dataset, comprehensive benchmark, and
strong approach for such problems. To facilitate future research, we make our
datasets, code, and pretrained models publicly available at
https://github.com/HKU-MMLab/Math-VR-CodePlot-CoT.

Abstract: Table Question Answering (TQA) aims to answer natural language questions
about tabular data, often accompanied by additional contexts such as text
passages. The task spans diverse settings, varying in table representation,
question/answer complexity, modality involved, and domain. While recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress in
TQA, the field still lacks a systematic organization and understanding of task
formulations, core challenges, and methodological trends, particularly in light
of emerging research directions such as reinforcement learning. This survey
addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive and structured overview of TQA
research with a focus on LLM-based methods. We provide a comprehensive
categorization of existing benchmarks and task setups. We group current
modeling strategies according to the challenges they target, and analyze their
strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we highlight underexplored but timely
topics that have not been systematically covered in prior research. By unifying
disparate research threads and identifying open problems, our survey offers a
consolidated foundation for the TQA community, enabling a deeper understanding
of the state of the art and guiding future developments in this rapidly
evolving area.

### [223] [Emotionally Charged, Logically Blurred: AI-driven Emotional Framing Impairs Human Fallacy Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09695)
*Yanran Chen,Lynn Greschner,Roman Klinger,Michael Klenk,Steffen Eger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究首次计算性地探讨了情感框架如何与逻辑谬误和说服力相互作用，使用大语言模型系统性地改变谬误论证中的情感诉求，发现LLM驱动的情感框架使人类谬误检测F1分数平均降低14.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 逻辑谬误在公共传播中普遍存在且可能误导受众，尽管缺乏合理性但谬误论证仍可能显得有说服力，因为说服力本质上是主观的。研究动机是理解情感框架如何影响谬误检测和说服力。

Method: 使用八个大语言模型在保持逻辑结构的同时向谬误论证中注入情感诉求，然后用最佳模型生成刺激材料进行人类研究。

Result: LLM驱动的情感框架使人类谬误检测F1分数平均降低14.5%；人类在感知愉悦情绪时比恐惧或悲伤时表现更好；这三种情绪相比中性或其他情绪状态与显著更高的说服力相关。

Conclusion: 这项工作对在谬误论证背景下AI驱动的情感操纵具有重要启示。

Abstract: Logical fallacies are common in public communication and can mislead
audiences; fallacious arguments may still appear convincing despite lacking
soundness, because convincingness is inherently subjective. We present the
first computational study of how emotional framing interacts with fallacies and
convincingness, using large language models (LLMs) to systematically change
emotional appeals in fallacious arguments. We benchmark eight LLMs on injecting
emotional appeal into fallacious arguments while preserving their logical
structures, then use the best models to generate stimuli for a human study. Our
results show that LLM-driven emotional framing reduces human fallacy detection
in F1 by 14.5% on average. Humans perform better in fallacy detection when
perceiving enjoyment than fear or sadness, and these three emotions also
correlate with significantly higher convincingness compared to neutral or other
emotion states. Our work has implications for AI-driven emotional manipulation
in the context of fallacious argumentation.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present a tendency of large language models (LLMs) to generate absurd
patterns despite their clear inappropriateness in a simple task of identifying
regularities in number series. Several approaches have been proposed to apply
LLMs to complex real-world tasks, such as providing knowledge through
retrieval-augmented generation and executing multi-step tasks using AI agent
frameworks. However, these approaches rely on the logical consistency and
self-coherence of LLMs, making it crucial to evaluate these aspects and
consider potential countermeasures. To identify cases where LLMs fail to
maintain logical consistency, we conducted an experiment in which LLMs were
asked to explain the patterns in various integer sequences, ranging from
arithmetic sequences to randomly generated integer series. While the models
successfully identified correct patterns in arithmetic and geometric sequences,
they frequently over-recognized patterns that were inconsistent with the given
numbers when analyzing randomly generated series. This issue was observed even
in multi-step reasoning models, including OpenAI o3, o4-mini, and Google Gemini
2.5 Flash Preview Thinking. This tendency to perceive non-existent patterns can
be interpreted as the AI model equivalent of Idola Tribus and highlights
potential limitations in their capability for applied tasks requiring logical
reasoning, even when employing chain-of-thought reasoning mechanisms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SeCon-RAG框架，通过两阶段语义过滤和冲突检测机制来防御RAG系统中的语料库污染攻击，在保持有用知识的同时提升生成鲁棒性和输出可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG系统容易受到语料库污染和污染攻击，现有防御方法通常采用激进过滤策略，导致有价值信息丢失和生成可靠性降低。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段使用EIRE引导的语义和聚类联合过滤，提取实体、意图和关系进行语义相关性评分；第二阶段使用EIRE引导的冲突感知过滤模块，分析查询、候选答案和检索知识之间的语义一致性。

Result: 在多种LLM和数据集上的广泛实验表明，SeCon-RAG显著优于最先进的防御方法，有效保留了有用知识同时减轻了冲突污染。

Conclusion: SeCon-RAG通过两阶段语义过滤和冲突检测机制，成功解决了RAG系统中的语料库污染问题，在保持知识完整性的同时显著提升了生成鲁棒性和输出可信度。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models
(LLMs) with external knowledge but are vulnerable to corpus poisoning and
contamination attacks, which can compromise output integrity. Existing defenses
often apply aggressive filtering, leading to unnecessary loss of valuable
information and reduced reliability in generation. To address this problem, we
propose a two-stage semantic filtering and conflict-free framework for
trustworthy RAG. In the first stage, we perform a joint filter with semantic
and cluster-based filtering which is guided by the Entity-intent-relation
extractor (EIRE). EIRE extracts entities, latent objectives, and entity
relations from both the user query and filtered documents, scores their
semantic relevance, and selectively adds valuable documents into the clean
retrieval database. In the second stage, we proposed an EIRE-guided
conflict-aware filtering module, which analyzes semantic consistency between
the query, candidate answers, and retrieved knowledge before final answer
generation, filtering out internal and external contradictions that could
mislead the model. Through this two-stage process, SeCon-RAG effectively
preserves useful knowledge while mitigating conflict contamination, achieving
significant improvements in both generation robustness and output
trustworthiness. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and datasets
demonstrate that the proposed SeCon-RAG markedly outperforms state-of-the-art
defense methods.

*Wenbin Guo,Xin Wang,Jiaoyan Chen,Lingbing Guo,Zhao Li,Zirui Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReaLM是一个新颖的KG补全框架，通过残差向量量化将KG嵌入离散化为紧凑代码序列，并将其作为可学习token集成到LLM词汇表中，实现符号知识和上下文知识的无缝融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的KG补全方法难以充分利用结构化语义表示，因为预训练KG模型的连续嵌入空间与LLM的离散token空间存在根本性不匹配，这阻碍了有效的语义传递并限制了性能。

Method: 1. 使用残差向量量化机制将预训练KG嵌入离散化为紧凑代码序列；2. 将这些代码序列作为可学习token集成到LLM词汇表中；3. 引入本体引导的类约束来强制执行语义一致性，基于类级兼容性细化实体预测。

Result: 在两个广泛使用的基准数据集上的大量实验表明，ReaLM实现了最先进的性能，证实了其在将结构化知识与大规模语言模型对齐方面的有效性。

Conclusion: ReaLM通过桥接KG嵌入和LLM标记化之间的差距，有效解决了结构化语义表示利用不足的问题，为KG补全任务提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), offering strong reasoning and generalization
capabilities beyond traditional embedding-based approaches. However, existing
LLM-based methods often struggle to fully exploit structured semantic
representations, as the continuous embedding space of pretrained KG models is
fundamentally misaligned with the discrete token space of LLMs. This
discrepancy hinders effective semantic transfer and limits their performance.
To address this challenge, we propose ReaLM, a novel and effective framework
that bridges the gap between KG embeddings and LLM tokenization through the
mechanism of residual vector quantization. ReaLM discretizes pretrained KG
embeddings into compact code sequences and integrates them as learnable tokens
within the LLM vocabulary, enabling seamless fusion of symbolic and contextual
knowledge. Furthermore, we incorporate ontology-guided class constraints to
enforce semantic consistency, refining entity predictions based on class-level
compatibility. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets
demonstrate that ReaLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, confirming its
effectiveness in aligning structured knowledge with large-scale language
models.

### [227] [All Code, No Thought: Current Language Models Struggle to Reason in Ciphered Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09714)
*Shiyuan Guo,Henry Sleight,Fabien Roger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了AI模型在加密推理方面的能力，发现模型在加密文本中推理时准确率显著下降，即使它们能准确翻译加密文本。这表明使用加密推理来规避思维链监控在当前模型中可能无效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI代理的广泛应用，检测有害AI行为变得重要。思维链监控是检测对抗性攻击和AI错位的方法，但攻击者和错位模型可能通过加密推理（在加密、翻译或压缩文本中隐藏推理）来规避这种监控。

Method: 测试了28种不同密码，对最多10个模型进行微调和提示，使其在特定密码中进行推理。使用数学问题作为推理能力的代理指标，测量模型在加密文本中的准确率。

Result: 发现不对称性：模型在加密文本中推理时准确率显著下降，即使它们能准确翻译加密文本。前沿模型在较不常见的密码中表现困难，但在知名密码（如rot13）中推理准确。加密推理能力与预训练数据中密码的普遍性相关。

Conclusion: 使用加密推理来规避思维链监控在当前模型中可能是无效的策略，并为限制未来前沿模型中这种能力的发展提供了指导。

Abstract: Detecting harmful AI actions is important as AI agents gain adoption.
Chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring is one method widely used to detect
adversarial attacks and AI misalignment. However, attackers and misaligned
models might evade CoT monitoring through ciphered reasoning: reasoning hidden
in encrypted, translated, or compressed text. To assess this risk, we test
whether models can perform ciphered reasoning. For each of 28 different
ciphers, we fine-tune and prompt up to 10 models to reason in that cipher. We
measure model accuracy on math problems as a proxy for reasoning ability.
Across the models we test, we find an asymmetry: model accuracy can drop
significantly when reasoning in ciphered text, even though models demonstrate
comprehension of ciphered text by being able to translate it accurately to
English. Even frontier models struggle with lesser-known ciphers, although they
can reason accurately in well-known ciphers like rot13. We show that ciphered
reasoning capability correlates with cipher prevalence in pretraining data. We
also identify scaling laws showing that ciphered reasoning capability improves
slowly with additional fine-tuning data. Our work suggests that evading CoT
monitoring using ciphered reasoning may be an ineffective tactic for current
models and offers guidance on constraining the development of this capability
in future frontier models.

*Haoran Sun,Zekun Zhang,Shaoning Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了PAMU机制，通过滑动窗口平均和指数移动平均的融合来动态更新偏好记忆，提升LLM在长期对话中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长期记忆方法在记忆更新方面存在不足，缺乏根据用户行为和上下文动态优化偏好记忆表示的机制。

Method: 使用滑动窗口平均(SW)和指数移动平均(EMA)构建融合的偏好感知表示，捕捉短期波动和长期用户倾向。

Result: 在LoCoMo数据集的五个任务场景中，该机制显著提升了五个基线的LLM输出质量。

Conclusion: PAMU机制在长期对话中有效提升了LLM的性能，验证了动态偏好记忆更新的重要性。

Abstract: One of the key factors influencing the reasoning capabilities of LLM-based
agents is their ability to leverage long-term memory. Integrating long-term
memory mechanisms allows agents to make informed decisions grounded in
historical interactions. While recent advances have significantly improved the
storage and retrieval components, by encoding memory into dense vectors for
similarity search or organizing memory as structured knowledge graphs most
existing approaches fall short in memory updating. In particular, they lack
mechanisms for dynamically refining preference memory representations in
response to evolving user behaviors and contexts. To address this gap, we
propose a Preference-Aware Memory Update Mechanism (PAMU) that enables dynamic
and personalized memory refinement. By integrating sliding window averages (SW)
with exponential moving averages (EMA), PAMU constructs a fused
preference-aware representation that captures both short-term fluctuations and
long-term user tendencies. We conduct experiments on five task scenarios of the
LoCoMo dataset, and the results show that our mechanism can significantly
improve the output quality of LLM in five baselines, validating its
effectiveness in long-term conversations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化简历信息提取对规模化人才招聘至关重要，但面临三大挑战：简历布局和内容的极端异质性、大语言模型的高成本和延迟、缺乏标准化数据集和评估工具。

Method: 结合微调的布局解析器来规范化文档格式，基于并行提示和指令调优的高效LLM提取器，以及由新基准数据集支持的两阶段自动化评估框架。

Result: 广泛实验表明该框架在准确性和效率上显著优于强基线，特别是微调的0.6B紧凑LLM在实现顶级准确性的同时大幅降低推理延迟和计算成本。

Conclusion: 该框架已在阿里巴巴智能HR平台全面部署，支持其各业务部门的实时应用。

Abstract: Automated resume information extraction is critical for scaling talent
acquisition, yet its real-world deployment faces three major challenges: the
extreme heterogeneity of resume layouts and content, the high cost and latency
of large language models (LLMs), and the lack of standardized datasets and
evaluation tools. In this work, we present a layout-aware and
efficiency-optimized framework for automated extraction and evaluation that
addresses all three challenges. Our system combines a fine-tuned layout parser
to normalize diverse document formats, an inference-efficient LLM extractor
based on parallel prompting and instruction tuning, and a robust two-stage
automated evaluation framework supported by new benchmark datasets. Extensive
experiments show that our framework significantly outperforms strong baselines
in both accuracy and efficiency. In particular, we demonstrate that a
fine-tuned compact 0.6B LLM achieves top-tier accuracy while significantly
reducing inference latency and computational cost. The system is fully deployed
in Alibaba's intelligent HR platform, supporting real-time applications across
its business units.

TL;DR: EVisRAG是一个端到端的视觉检索增强生成框架，通过证据引导的多图像推理来减少幻觉并增强视觉问答的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VRAG系统在多图像感知和证据整合方面存在不足，导致推理基础薄弱和错误结论。

Method: 提出EVisRAG框架，首先观察检索到的图像并记录每张图像的证据，然后从聚合证据中得出最终答案。使用Reward-Scoped Group Relative Policy Optimization (RS-GRPO)联合优化视觉感知和推理能力。

Result: 在多个视觉问答基准测试中，EVisRAG相比基础VLM平均提升27%的性能，能够精确感知和定位问题相关证据。

Conclusion: EVisRAG通过RS-GRPO实现了对多图像证据的精确感知和推理，显著提升了视觉问答的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Visual retrieval-augmented generation (VRAG) augments vision-language models
(VLMs) with external visual knowledge to ground reasoning and reduce
hallucinations. Yet current VRAG systems often fail to reliably perceive and
integrate evidence across multiple images, leading to weak grounding and
erroneous conclusions. In this paper, we propose EVisRAG, an end-to-end
framework that learns to reason with evidence-guided multi-image to address
this issue. The model first observes retrieved images and records per-image
evidence, then derives the final answer from the aggregated evidence. To train
EVisRAG effectively, we introduce Reward-Scoped Group Relative Policy
Optimization (RS-GRPO), which binds fine-grained rewards to scope-specific
tokens to jointly optimize visual perception and reasoning abilities of VLMs.
Experimental results on multiple visual question answering benchmarks
demonstrate that EVisRAG delivers substantial end-to-end gains over backbone
VLM with 27\% improvements on average. Further analysis shows that, powered by
RS-GRPO, EVisRAG improves answer accuracy by precisely perceiving and
localizing question-relevant evidence across multiple images and deriving the
final answer from that evidence, much like a real detective.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Judge's Verdict Benchmark，一种评估LLM作为响应准确性评估法官的两步方法论，测试了54个LLM在复制人类判断方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型作为响应准确性评估法官的能力，研究它们能否复制人类判断，并建立标准化基准来分类LLM法官的性能层级。

Method: 两步方法论：先进行相关性测试筛选出强对齐的法官，然后使用z分数进行人类相似性测试，识别人类相似判断（|z| < 1）和超一致判断（z > 1）两种模式。

Result: 54个测试的LLM中有27个达到Tier 1性能：23个模型表现出人类相似模式，4个模型表现出超一致行为。法官优秀程度不仅取决于模型大小，还取决于特定训练策略。

Conclusion: 相关性分析不足以评估法官，需要基于一致性模式的"法官图灵测试"，并提供了标准化基准来为不同评估需求分类LLM法官的性能层级。

Abstract: This research introduces the Judge's Verdict Benchmark, a novel two-step
methodology to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges for response
accuracy evaluation tasks. We assess how well 54 LLMs can replicate human
judgment when scoring responses from RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) or
Agentic pipelines against ground truth answers. Our methodology progresses from
traditional correlation analysis to comprehensive Cohen's Kappa analysis that
measures actual agreement patterns. The two-step approach includes: (1) a
correlation test that filters judges with strong alignment, followed by (2) a
human-likeness test using z-scores to identify two distinct judgment patterns:
human-like judgment (|z| < 1) that mimics natural human variation, and
super-consistent judgment (z > 1) that exceeds typical human-to-human agreement
levels. This methodology reveals that 27 out of 54 tested LLMs achieve Tier 1
performance: 23 models exhibit human-like patterns that preserve the nuances of
human judgment, while 4 models demonstrate super-consistent behavior, a pattern
that could indicate either enhanced reliability or oversimplification of
complex judgments. Testing 43 open-source models (1B-405B parameters) and 11
closed models (GPT, Gemini, Claude variants), we demonstrate that judge
excellence is not solely dependent on model size but on specific training
strategies. Our key contributions include: (1) establishing that correlation
alone is insufficient for judge evaluation, (2) introducing a "Turing Test for
judges" based on agreement patterns, and (3) providing a standardized benchmark
for classifying LLM judges into distinct performance tiers for different
evaluation needs.

TL;DR: 提出了Gold Panning Bandits框架，利用LLM的位置偏见作为诊断信号，通过重新排列文档来识别最相关内容，相比随机排列基线减少65%的查询次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多文档环境中存在强烈的位置偏见，现有方法将其视为需要减轻的噪声，但本文将其转化为可利用的诊断信号。

Method: 将文档重新排序问题建模为二分图匹配问题，提出贪心O(N log N)策略，将最不确定的文档放在最具信息量的位置，相比匈牙利算法的O(N^3)复杂度更高效。

Result: 在知识密集型NLP任务中，相比随机排列基线，该方法使用高达65%更少的语言模型查询就能识别相关文档，显著降低计算成本且无需模型重训练。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明固有的LLM偏见可以从负担转化为资产，实现高效的推理时优化。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit a strong position bias in multi-document
contexts, systematically prioritizing information based on location rather than
relevance. While existing approaches treat this bias as noise to be mitigated,
we introduce Gold Panning Bandits, a framework that leverages position bias as
a diagnostic signal: by reordering documents and observing shifts in the
model's responses, we can efficiently identify the most relevant content. We
frame the problem of choosing reorderings as a bipartite matching problem.
While an optimal assignment can be computed at each iteration with the
Hungarian algorithm in $O(N^3)$ time, we propose a greedy $O(N \log N)$
strategy that achieves comparable performance by prioritizing the placement of
the most uncertain documents in the most informative positions. Our approach
identifies relevant documents using up to 65\% fewer language model queries
than random permutation baselines on knowledge-intensive NLP tasks,
substantially reducing computational cost without model retraining. This work
demonstrates that inherent LLM biases can be transformed from liabilities into
assets for efficient, inference-time optimization.

Motivation: 传统监督方法需要大量标注数据，对于低资源语言成本高昂，因此需要开发少样本学习框架。

Method: 使用卡方统计进行关键词提取，结合自适应多数投票进行决策，探索统计关键词选择与随机方法的对比。

Result: PromptGuard达到67.61的微F1分数，优于n-gram基线(60.75)和随机方法(14.65)，卡方关键词在所有类别中表现最一致。

Conclusion: 卡方关键词提取提供跨类别的持续改进，自适应投票对需要扩展分类轮次的模糊案例有益。

Abstract: The BLP-2025 Task 1A requires Bengali hate speech classification into six
categories. Traditional supervised approaches need extensive labeled datasets
that are expensive for low-resource languages. We developed PromptGuard, a
few-shot framework combining chi-square statistical analysis for keyword
extraction with adaptive majority voting for decision-making. We explore
statistical keyword selection versus random approaches and adaptive voting
mechanisms that extend classification based on consensus quality. Chi-square
keywords provide consistent improvements across categories, while adaptive
voting benefits ambiguous cases requiring extended classification rounds.
PromptGuard achieves a micro-F1 of 67.61, outperforming n-gram baselines
(60.75) and random approaches (14.65). Ablation studies confirm
chi-square-based keywords show the most consistent impact across all
categories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解语言和嵌入模型如何编码语义关系对于模型可解释性和控制至关重要，现代高维文本表示缺乏直观的几何特性。

Method: 引入Rotor-Invariant Shift Estimation (RISE)方法，将语义转换表示为嵌入空间中一致的旋转操作，利用现代语言表示的流形结构。

Result: 在3个嵌入模型、3个数据集和7种形态多样的语言上评估，RISE能一致地映射具有不同语法特征的语篇级语义转换。

Conclusion: 首次系统证明语篇级语义转换对应于多语言嵌入空间中一致的几何操作，在句子层面经验支持线性表示假设。

Abstract: Understanding how language and embedding models encode semantic relationships
is fundamental to model interpretability and control. While early word
embeddings exhibited intuitive vector arithmetic (''king'' - ''man'' +
''woman'' = ''queen''), modern high-dimensional text representations lack
straightforward interpretable geometric properties. We introduce
Rotor-Invariant Shift Estimation (RISE), a geometric approach that represents
semantic transformations as consistent rotational operations in embedding
space, leveraging the manifold structure of modern language representations.
RISE operations have the ability to operate across both languages and models
with high transfer of performance, suggesting the existence of analogous
cross-lingual geometric structure. We evaluate RISE across three embedding
models, three datasets, and seven morphologically diverse languages in five
major language groups. Our results demonstrate that RISE consistently maps
discourse-level semantic transformations with distinct grammatical features
(e.g., negation and conditionality) across languages and models. This work
provides the first systematic demonstration that discourse-level semantic
transformations correspond to consistent geometric operations in multilingual
embedding spaces, empirically supporting the Linear Representation Hypothesis
at the sentence level.

Abstract: Diet plays a central role in human health, and Nutrition Question Answering
(QA) offers a promising path toward personalized dietary guidance and the
prevention of diet-related chronic diseases. However, existing methods face two
fundamental challenges: the limited reasoning capacity of single-agent systems
and the complexity of designing effective multi-agent architectures, as well as
contextual overload that hinders accurate decision-making. We introduce
Nutritional-Graph Router (NG-Router), a novel framework that formulates
nutritional QA as a supervised, knowledge-graph-guided multi-agent
collaboration problem. NG-Router integrates agent nodes into heterogeneous
knowledge graphs and employs a graph neural network to learn task-aware routing
distributions over agents, leveraging soft supervision derived from empirical
agent performance. To further address contextual overload, we propose a
gradient-based subgraph retrieval mechanism that identifies salient evidence
during training, thereby enhancing multi-hop and relational reasoning.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and backbone models
demonstrate that NG-Router consistently outperforms both single-agent and
ensemble baselines, offering a principled approach to domain-aware multi-agent
reasoning for complex nutritional health tasks.

*Sil Hamilton,Matthew Wilkens,Andrew Piper*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NarraBench提出了一个理论指导的叙事理解任务分类法，并调查了该领域的78个现有基准，发现当前评估覆盖不足，特别是叙事事件、风格、视角和启示等方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前叙事理解任务的评估存在显著不足，许多重要方面被忽视或与现有指标不匹配，需要新的评估方法来覆盖被忽略的叙事理解维度。

Method: 开发了一个理论指导的叙事理解任务分类法，并对该领域的78个现有基准进行了系统调查和分析。

Result: 发现只有27%的叙事任务被现有基准充分覆盖，叙事事件、风格、视角和启示等关键方面在当前评估中几乎缺失。

Conclusion: 需要开发更多能够评估构成性主观和视角性叙事方面的基准，该分类法、调查和方法论对测试LLM叙事理解的NLP研究人员具有重要价值。

Abstract: We present NarraBench, a theory-informed taxonomy of narrative-understanding
tasks, as well as an associated survey of 78 existing benchmarks in the area.
We find significant need for new evaluations covering aspects of narrative
understanding that are either overlooked in current work or are poorly aligned
with existing metrics. Specifically, we estimate that only 27% of narrative
tasks are well captured by existing benchmarks, and we note that some areas --
including narrative events, style, perspective, and revelation -- are nearly
absent from current evaluations. We also note the need for increased
development of benchmarks capable of assessing constitutively subjective and
perspectival aspects of narrative, that is, aspects for which there is
generally no single correct answer. Our taxonomy, survey, and methodology are
of value to NLP researchers seeking to test LLM narrative understanding.

*Nafiseh Nikeghbal,Amir Hossein Kargaran,Jana Diesner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoBia是一种轻量级对抗攻击方法，通过构建包含偏见声明的对话来测试LLMs能否从偏见中恢复并拒绝偏见性后续问题，揭示了LLMs中深藏的偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs通过了标准安全检查，但在对话中仍会表现出有害行为（如种族主义观点），需要系统性地分析这些偏见出现的条件。

Method: 创建包含偏见声明的构造对话，评估模型能否从虚构的偏见声明中恢复并拒绝偏见性后续问题，使用6个社会人口类别进行测试。

Result: 有目的构建的对话能可靠地揭示偏见放大，LLMs经常无法在对话中拒绝偏见性后续问题，暴露了深层的嵌入偏见。

Conclusion: 这种压力测试凸显了通过交互可以暴露LLMs中深藏的偏见，需要改进模型的安全防护机制。

Abstract: Improvements in model construction, including fortified safety guardrails,
allow Large language models (LLMs) to increasingly pass standard safety checks.
However, LLMs sometimes slip into revealing harmful behavior, such as
expressing racist viewpoints, during conversations. To analyze this
systematically, we introduce CoBia, a suite of lightweight adversarial attacks
that allow us to refine the scope of conditions under which LLMs depart from
normative or ethical behavior in conversations. CoBia creates a constructed
conversation where the model utters a biased claim about a social group. We
then evaluate whether the model can recover from the fabricated bias claim and
reject biased follow-up questions. We evaluate 11 open-source as well as
proprietary LLMs for their outputs related to six socio-demographic categories
that are relevant to individual safety and fair treatment, i.e., gender, race,
religion, nationality, sex orientation, and others. Our evaluation is based on
established LLM-based bias metrics, and we compare the results against human
judgments to scope out the LLMs' reliability and alignment. The results suggest
that purposefully constructed conversations reliably reveal bias amplification
and that LLMs often fail to reject biased follow-up questions during dialogue.
This form of stress-testing highlights deeply embedded biases that can be
surfaced through interaction. Code and artifacts are available at

### [239] [iBERT: Interpretable Style Embeddings via Sense Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09882)
*Vishal Anand,Milad Alshomary,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: iBERT是一种可解释的BERT编码器，能生成内在可解释和可控的嵌入表示，通过稀疏非负混合的方式将输入token表示为k个上下文无关的语义向量，支持在句子或token级别进行模块化控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统BERT模型缺乏可解释性和可控性的问题，设计能够模块化展示语言中判别性线索（如风格和语义结构）的嵌入表示。

Method: 使用稀疏非负混合方法，将每个输入token表示为k个上下文无关的语义向量的组合，这些向量可以池化为句子嵌入或直接在token级别使用。

Result: 在STEL基准测试中，iBERT在风格表示效果上比SBERT基线提高了约8个百分点，同时在作者验证任务上保持竞争力，能够将特定风格属性（如表情符号使用、正式性、拼写错误）分配给特定的语义向量。

Conclusion: iBERT不仅限于风格建模，其结构模块化设计能够可解释地分解数据中存在的任何判别性信号，即使在监督混合风格和语义因素的情况下也能实现泛化。

Abstract: We present iBERT (interpretable-BERT), an encoder to produce inherently
interpretable and controllable embeddings - designed to modularize and expose
the discriminative cues present in language, such as stylistic and semantic
structure. Each input token is represented as a sparse, non-negative mixture
over k context-independent sense vectors, which can be pooled into sentence
embeddings or used directly at the token level. This enables modular control
over representation, before any decoding or downstream use.
  To demonstrate our model's interpretability, we evaluate it on a suite of
style-focused tasks. On the STEL benchmark, it improves style representation
effectiveness by ~8 points over SBERT-style baselines, while maintaining
competitive performance on authorship verification. Because each embedding is a
structured composition of interpretable senses, we highlight how specific style
attributes - such as emoji use, formality, or misspelling can be assigned to
specific sense vectors. While our experiments center on style, iBERT is not
limited to stylistic modeling. Its structural modularity is designed to
interpretably decompose whichever discriminative signals are present in the
data - enabling generalization even when supervision blends stylistic and
semantic factors.

### [240] [DELTA: Dynamic Layer-Aware Token Attention for Efficient Long-Context Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09883)
*Hossein Entezari Zarch,Lei Gao,Chaoyi Jiang,Murali Annavarm*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DELTA是一种无需训练的稀疏注意力机制，通过将Transformer层分组为全注意力层、选择层和稀疏注意力层，在保持推理精度的同时显著减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在解码过程中需要对整个序列进行注意力计算，计算成本高昂。现有稀疏注意力方法虽然减少计算，但在推理任务中会导致严重的精度下降。

Method: 将Transformer层分为三组：初始全注意力层、选择层（通过聚合注意力分数识别关键token）和稀疏注意力层（仅关注选定子集）。保留完整KV缓存以保证精度，但避免在多个层中进行昂贵的全注意力计算。

Result: 在AIME和GPQA-Diamond等推理基准测试中，DELTA匹配或超越全注意力精度，同时将注意力token数量减少5倍，实现1.5倍端到端加速。

Conclusion: 选择性重用中间注意力图为高效长上下文推理提供了稳健路径。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance on
challenging benchmarks by generating long chains of intermediate steps, but
their inference cost is dominated by decoding, where each new token must attend
to the entire growing sequence. Existing sparse attention methods reduce
computation by pruning the key-value (KV) cache, yet they suffer from severe
accuracy degradation on reasoning tasks due to cumulative selection errors and
the dynamic importance of tokens over long derivations. We present
\textbf{DELTA}, a training-free sparse attention mechanism that achieves
computational efficiency without sacrificing model accuracy. DELTA partitions
transformer layers into three groups: initial layers that use full attention, a
small set of \emph{selection layers} that identify salient tokens via
aggregated head-level attention scores, and subsequent \emph{sparse-attention
layers} that attend only to the selected subset. This design preserves the full
KV cache in GPU memory for accuracy, while avoiding expensive full-attention
computation over many layers. On reasoning benchmarks such as AIME and
GPQA-Diamond, DELTA matches or surpasses full attention in accuracy, while
reducing the number of attended tokens by up to $5\times$ and delivering
$1.5\times$ end-to-end speedup. Our results show that selective reuse of
intermediate attention maps offers a robust path toward efficient long-context
reasoning.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite autoregressive large language models (arLLMs) being the current
dominant paradigm in language modeling, they resist knowledge injection via
fine-tuning due to inherent shortcomings such as the "reversal curse" -- the
challenge of answering questions that reverse the original information order in
the training sample. Masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are rapidly
emerging as a powerful alternative to the arLLM paradigm, with evidence of
better data efficiency and free of the "reversal curse" in pre-training.
However, it is unknown whether these advantages extend to the post-training
phase, i.e. whether pre-trained dLLMs can easily acquire new knowledge through
fine-tuning. On three diverse datasets, we fine-tune arLLMs and dLLMs,
evaluating them with forward and backward style Question Answering (QA) to
probe knowledge generalization and the reversal curse. Our results confirm that
arLLMs critically rely on extensive data augmentation via paraphrases for QA
generalization, and paraphrases are only effective when their information order
matches the QA style. Conversely, dLLMs achieve high accuracies on both forward
and backward QAs without paraphrases; adding paraphrases yields only marginal
gains. Lastly, inspired by the dLLM's performance, we introduce a novel masked
fine-tuning paradigm for knowledge injection into pre-trained arLLMs. This
proposed method successfully and drastically improves the data efficiency of
arLLM fine-tuning, effectively closing the performance gap with dLLMs.

### [242] [Abductive Preference Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09887)
*Yijin Ni,Peng Qi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出溯因偏好学习，通过逆转传统条件化方式，在给定回答的情况下学习对提示的偏好，以解决大语言模型在反事实提示下过度自信的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前沿大语言模型即使经过RLHF和DPO对齐后仍存在过度自信问题，无法区分需要不同回答的反事实提示，现有偏好学习只关注为给定提示选择正确回答，而忽略了应该改变回答的反事实提示。

Method: 提出溯因偏好学习微调范式，从HaluEval QA基准构建包含1,001个条目的溯因数据集，实现溯因DPO及其变体DPOP，并采用多任务目标统一两种方法。

Result: 在溯因数据集上，多任务DPOP将回答选择准确率从90.0%提升至99.5%，提示区分准确率从54.7%提升至85.0%，在AlpacaEval上胜率从5.26%提升至6.17%。

Conclusion: 溯因偏好学习在保持传统偏好优化优势的同时，有效解决了反事实提示这一被忽视的挑战，提高了模型对提示差异的敏感性。

Abstract: Frontier large language models such as GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet remain prone
to overconfidence even after alignment through Reinforcement Learning with
Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). For instance,
they tend to offer the same conservative answer "No" to both questions "Can I
eat the [food / potato chips] that has been left out overnight?" despite the
latter requiring no refridgeration for safe consumption. We find that this
failure is potentially attributed to a limitation of existing preference
learning: it emphasizes selecting the correct response for a given prompt,
while neglecting counterfactual prompts that should alter the response.
  To address this limitation, we propose abductive preference learning, a
fine-tuning paradigm that reverses the conventional conditioning by learning
preferences over prompts given a response. To validate this idea, we construct
an abductive dataset derived from the HaluEval QA benchmark with 1,001 entries,
implementing abductive DPO and its variant DPOP. Experiments reveal
complementary strengths: standard methods improve response selection, abductive
methods improve prompt discrimination, while a multitask objective unifies
both. On the abductive dataset, multitask DPOP boosts accuracy from $90.0\%$ to
$99.5\%$ in response selection and $54.7\%$ to $85.0\%$ in prompt
discrimination, with qualitative evidence highlighting improved sensitivity to
prompt differences. Finally, evaluation on AlpacaEval shows multitask DPOP
improves win rate (from $5.26\%$ to $6.17\%$), confirming that abductive
preference learning preserves the benefits of conventional preference
optimization while addressing the overlooked challenge of counterfactual
prompts.

TL;DR: HIPPD是一个受大脑启发的性格检测框架，通过模拟人脑的层次信息处理机制，结合大语言模型、动态记忆模块和专用轻量模型，在文本性格检测任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习方法难以捕捉跨多帖子的上下文信息，在语义稀疏环境中提取代表性特征的能力不足，需要更有效的性格检测框架。

Method: 使用大语言模型模拟大脑皮层进行全局语义推理，动态记忆模块模拟前额叶皮层进行自适应门控和选择性保留关键特征，专用轻量模型模拟基底神经节通过赢家通吃机制动态路由。

Result: 在Kaggle和Pandora数据集上的广泛实验表明，HIPPD始终优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: HIPPD通过模拟人脑的层次信息处理机制，有效解决了文本性格检测中的上下文捕捉和特征提取问题，取得了优异的性能。

Abstract: Personality detection from text aims to infer an individual's personality
traits based on linguistic patterns. However, existing machine learning
approaches often struggle to capture contextual information spanning multiple
posts and tend to fall short in extracting representative and robust features
in semantically sparse environments. This paper presents HIPPD, a
brain-inspired framework for personality detection that emulates the
hierarchical information processing of the human brain. HIPPD utilises a large
language model to simulate the cerebral cortex, enabling global semantic
reasoning and deep feature abstraction. A dynamic memory module, modelled after
the prefrontal cortex, performs adaptive gating and selective retention of
critical features, with all adjustments driven by dopaminergic prediction error
feedback. Subsequently, a set of specialised lightweight models, emulating the
basal ganglia, are dynamically routed via a strict winner-takes-all mechanism
to capture the personality-related patterns they are most proficient at
recognising. Extensive experiments on the Kaggle and Pandora datasets
demonstrate that HIPPD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Alignment training has tradeoffs: it helps language models (LMs) gain in
reasoning and instruction following but might lose out on skills such as
creativity and calibration, where unaligned base models are better at. We aim
to make the best of both worlds through model collaboration, where different
models in the training pipeline collaborate and complement each other. Since LM
responses feature interleaving skills that favor different models, we propose
Switch Generation, where pretrained and aligned model versions take turns to
``speak'' in a response sequence. Specifically, we train a switcher LM by
learning from outcomes of choosing different models to generate the next
segment across diverse queries and contexts. At inference time, the switcher LM
guides different model checkpoints to dynamically generate the next segment
where their strengths are most needed. Extensive experiments with 8 model
collaboration baselines and 18 datasets show that 1) model collaboration
consistently outperforms individual models on 16 out of 18 tasks, and 2) Switch
Generation further outperforms baselines by 12.9% on average. Further analysis
reveals that Switch Generation discovers compositional skills to solve problems
where individual models struggle and generalizes to unseen models and tasks,
reusing and repurposing by-products in expensive model training pipelines that
are otherwise discarded.

TL;DR: 本文研究了通过微调大语言模型来减少摘要生成中的不忠实内容，提出了基于span级别标注的三种微调方法，其中unlikelihood训练效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型能生成流畅的摘要，但经常产生不忠实的内容，现有缓解策略无法完全解决这一问题。

Method: 使用多种LLM自动生成训练集摘要，用GPT-4o进行span级别幻觉标注，然后采用梯度上升、unlikelihood训练和任务向量否定三种方法微调模型。

Result: 实验结果表明所有三种方法都能利用span级别标注提高忠实度，其中unlikelihood训练效果最好。

Conclusion: 基于span级别标注的微调策略能有效提升LLM生成摘要的忠实度，为减少幻觉提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Abstractive summarization using large language models (LLMs) has become an
essential tool for condensing information. However, despite their ability to
generate fluent summaries, these models sometimes produce unfaithful summaries,
introducing hallucinations at the word, phrase, or concept level. Existing
mitigation strategies, such as post-processing corrections or contrastive
learning with synthetically generated negative samples, fail to fully address
the diverse errors that can occur in LLM-generated summaries. In this paper, we
investigate fine-tuning strategies to reduce the occurrence of unfaithful spans
in generated summaries. First, we automatically generate summaries for the set
of source documents in the training set with a variety of LLMs and then use
GPT-4o to annotate any hallucinations it detects at the span-level. Leveraging
these annotations, we fine-tune LLMs with both hallucination-free summaries and
annotated unfaithful spans to enhance model faithfulness. In this paper, we
introduce a new dataset that contains both faithful and unfaithful summaries
with span-level labels and we evaluate three techniques to fine-tuning a LLM to
improve the faithfulness of the resulting summarization: gradient ascent,
unlikelihood training, and task vector negation. Experimental results show that
all three approaches successfully leverage span-level annotations to improve
faithfulness, with unlikelihood training being the most effective.

TL;DR: 提出了SHIELD框架，通过建模预设上下文和检测虚假主张来检测仇恨表情包，在多数据集和指标上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前仇恨表情包检测方法主要依赖预训练语言模型，但较少关注仇恨表情包的本质特征。基于哲学和心理学见解，认为仇恨表情包具有预设上下文和表达虚假主张两个关键特征。

Method: 开发PCM模块建模多模态上下文信息，引入FACT模块整合外部知识并利用跨模态参考图检测虚假主张，结合两者构建SHIELD框架。

Result: 在多个数据集和指标上优于最先进方法，并在假新闻检测等其他任务上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SHIELD框架通过捕捉仇恨表情包的本质特征实现了更有效的检测，展示了在多模态内容理解任务中的潜力。

Abstract: While memes are often humorous, they are frequently used to disseminate hate,
causing serious harm to individuals and society. Current approaches to hateful
meme detection mainly rely on pre-trained language models. However, less focus
has been dedicated to \textit{what make a meme hateful}. Drawing on insights
from philosophy and psychology, we argue that hateful memes are characterized
by two essential features: a \textbf{presupposed context} and the expression of
\textbf{false claims}. To capture presupposed context, we develop \textbf{PCM}
for modeling contextual information across modalities. To detect false claims,
we introduce the \textbf{FACT} module, which integrates external knowledge and
harnesses cross-modal reference graphs. By combining PCM and FACT, we introduce
\textbf{\textsf{SHIELD}}, a hateful meme detection framework designed to
capture the fundamental nature of hate. Extensive experiments show that SHIELD
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across datasets and metrics, while
demonstrating versatility on other tasks, such as fake news detection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出单令牌保留率(STRR)作为分词公平性评估新指标，发现现有分词器系统性地优先处理英语，中文支持较好，但印地语等语言存在碎片化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准分词评估指标fertility只关注压缩效率，但掩盖了词汇表在不同语言和领域间的分配公平性问题。

Method: 分析6个广泛使用的分词器在7种语言和2个领域中的表现，提出STRR指标来衡量单词保留为单个令牌的比例。

Result: 英语分词稳定性高，中文分词效率较低(高fertility)，但STRR显示中文支持较好；印地语等语言存在严重碎片化问题。

Conclusion: STRR补充了fertility指标的不足，为设计更公平的多语言分词器提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Tokenization is a crucial but under-evaluated step in large language models
(LLMs). The standard metric, fertility (the average number of tokens per word),
captures compression efficiency but obscures how vocabularies are allocated
across languages and domains. We analyze six widely used tokenizers across
seven languages and two domains, finding stable fertility for English, high
fertility for Chinese, and little domain sensitivity. To address fertility's
blind spots, we propose the Single Token Retention Rate (STRR), which measures
the proportion of words preserved as single tokens. STRR reveals systematic
prioritization of English, strong support for Chinese, and fragmentation in
Hindi, offering an interpretable view of cross-lingual fairness. Our results
show that STRR complements fertility and provides practical guidance for
designing more equitable multilingual tokenizers.

Motivation: 当前审议树搜索领域缺乏统一的形式化框架，特别是在奖励信号的角色上存在模糊性——它是瞬态启发式还是持久学习目标？

Method: 引入统一框架将搜索算法分解为三个核心组件：搜索机制、奖励公式和转移函数，建立搜索指导与参数化奖励建模的形式化区别。

Conclusion: 该框架为解决奖励信号角色模糊性提供了形式化基础，为系统性推进自主、自我改进智能体的研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Deliberative tree search is a cornerstone of modern Large Language Model
(LLM) research, driving the pivot from brute-force scaling toward algorithmic
efficiency. This single paradigm unifies two critical frontiers:
\textbf{Test-Time Scaling (TTS)}, which deploys on-demand computation to solve
hard problems, and \textbf{Self-Improvement}, which uses search-generated data
to durably enhance model parameters. However, this burgeoning field is
fragmented and lacks a common formalism, particularly concerning the ambiguous
role of the reward signal -- is it a transient heuristic or a durable learning
target? This paper resolves this ambiguity by introducing a unified framework
that deconstructs search algorithms into three core components: the
\emph{Search Mechanism}, \emph{Reward Formulation}, and \emph{Transition
Function}. We establish a formal distinction between transient \textbf{Search
Guidance} for TTS and durable \textbf{Parametric Reward Modeling} for
Self-Improvement. Building on this formalism, we introduce a component-centric
taxonomy, synthesize the state-of-the-art, and chart a research roadmap toward
more systematic progress in creating autonomous, self-improving agents.

Motivation: 随着机器翻译日益普及，了解公众如何感知和依赖不完美的机器翻译对于将MT研究置于实际应用背景中至关重要。

Method: 在公共博物馆进行人类研究（n=452），调查流畅性和充分性错误如何影响双语和非双语用户在休闲使用中对MT的依赖。

Result: 非双语用户由于缺乏评估策略和替代方案而经常过度依赖MT，而经历错误影响会促使用户重新评估未来的依赖。

Abstract: As Machine Translation (MT) becomes increasingly commonplace, understanding
how the general public perceives and relies on imperfect MT is crucial for
contextualizing MT research in real-world applications. We present a human
study conducted in a public museum (n=452), investigating how fluency and
adequacy errors impact bilingual and non-bilingual users' reliance on MT during
casual use. Our findings reveal that non-bilingual users often over-rely on MT
due to a lack of evaluation strategies and alternatives, while experiencing the
impact of errors can prompt users to reassess future reliance. This highlights
the need for MT evaluation and NLP explanation techniques to promote not only
MT quality, but also MT literacy among its users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音到语音翻译方法使用语音令牌作为中间表示，但单个令牌语义密度不足，需要多个令牌表达完整语义单元。

Method: 引入多令牌预测损失（MTP）到S2UT模型中，在CTC损失计算的隐藏表示层应用MTP损失，使模型能在每个位置预测多个后续令牌。

Result: 所有MTP损失变体都持续改善了S2UT翻译质量，其中MTP-S2UT实现了最佳性能。

Conclusion: 在中间层应用MTP损失能够更早、更有效地增强隐藏表示，提升语音到单元翻译的信息密度和语义完整性。

Abstract: Current direct speech-to-speech translation methods predominantly employ
speech tokens as intermediate representations. However, a single speech token
is not dense in semantics, so we generally need multiple tokens to express a
complete semantic unit. To address this limitation, we introduce multi-token
prediction (MTP) loss into speech-to-unit translation (S2UT) models, enabling
models to predict multiple subsequent tokens at each position, thereby
capturing more complete semantics and enhancing information density per
position. Initial MTP implementations apply the loss at the final layer, which
improves output representation but initiates information enrichment too late.
We hypothesize that advancing the information enrichment process to
intermediate layers can achieve earlier and more effective enhancement of
hidden representation. Consequently, we propose MTP-S2UT loss, applying MTP
loss to hidden representation where CTC loss is computed. Experiments
demonstrate that all MTP loss variants consistently improve the quality of S2UT
translation, with MTP-S2UT achieving the best performance.

Motivation: 现有推理增强搜索代理在复杂多跳问答任务中表现不佳，因为其推理和搜索能力有限，难以处理复杂或复合查询。

Method: 使用强化学习训练LLM搜索代理进行查询扩展，同时搜索多个查询变体；引入预训练压缩器模型帮助理解检索文档，让搜索代理专注于查询生成以提高检索召回率。

Conclusion: 即使小规模3B LLM在压缩器模型辅助下也能展现强大的查询扩展能力，在多跳问答基准上达到最先进水平。

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented search agents, such as Search-R1, are trained to reason,
search, and generate the final answer iteratively. Nevertheless, due to their
limited capabilities in reasoning and search, their performance on multi-hop QA
benchmarks remains far from satisfactory. To handle complex or compound
queries, we train an LLM-based search agent with the native capability of query
expansion through reinforcement learning. In each turn, our search agent
proposes several query variants, which are searched simultaneously to cover
more relevant information. Meanwhile, given limited post-training data and
computing resources, it is very challenging for a search agent to master
multiple tasks, including query generation, retrieved information
understanding, and answer generation. Therefore, we propose incorporating a
pre-trained squeezer model that helps the search agent understand the retrieved
documents, allowing the search agent to focus on query generation for high
retrieval recall. With the assistance of the squeezer model, we discover that
even a small-scale 3B LLM can demonstrate a strong capability of query
expansion and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the multi-hop QA benchmarks.
To be specific, our experiments across seven question-answering benchmarks
demonstrate that our method, named ExpandSearch, achieves an average
improvement of 4.4% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with strong gains
on multi-hop reasoning tasks requiring diverse evidence aggregation.

TL;DR: 论文识别了大型语言模型在长链思维推理中的路径漂移漏洞，即推理轨迹可能偏离安全对齐路径，导致违反安全约束的内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型被部署用于复杂推理任务，长链思维提示成为结构化推理的关键范式。尽管有对齐技术提供早期保护，但发现推理轨迹可能偏离对齐路径的安全漏洞。

Method: 通过实证分析识别了路径漂移的三个行为触发因素，并构建了三阶段路径漂移诱导框架，包括认知负荷放大、自我角色启动和条件链劫持。

Result: 研究发现每个阶段都能独立降低拒绝率，而它们的组合会进一步放大效果。提出了路径级防御策略，包括角色归因修正和元认知反思。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在长形式推理中需要超越令牌级对齐的轨迹级对齐监督。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for complex
reasoning tasks, Long Chain-of-Thought (Long-CoT) prompting has emerged as a
key paradigm for structured inference. Despite early-stage safeguards enabled
by alignment techniques such as RLHF, we identify a previously underexplored
vulnerability: reasoning trajectories in Long-CoT models can drift from aligned
paths, resulting in content that violates safety constraints. We term this
phenomenon Path Drift. Through empirical analysis, we uncover three behavioral
triggers of Path Drift: (1) first-person commitments that induce goal-driven
reasoning that delays refusal signals; (2) ethical evaporation, where
surface-level disclaimers bypass alignment checkpoints; (3) condition chain
escalation, where layered cues progressively steer models toward unsafe
completions. Building on these insights, we introduce a three-stage Path Drift
Induction Framework comprising cognitive load amplification, self-role priming,
and condition chain hijacking. Each stage independently reduces refusal rates,
while their combination further compounds the effect. To mitigate these risks,
we propose a path-level defense strategy incorporating role attribution
correction and metacognitive reflection (reflective safety cues). Our findings
highlight the need for trajectory-level alignment oversight in long-form
reasoning beyond token-level alignment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文探索了在医疗文本分类任务中使用轻量级编码器的效果，发现DistilBERT在交叉熵损失下表现最佳，为医疗NLP部署提供了实用方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗环境中部署面临成本、延迟和隐私限制，需要寻找轻量级但有效的替代方案。

Method: 使用医疗摘要语料库，在固定tokenizer、序列长度、优化器和调度的情况下，对BERT base和DistilBERT进行微调，比较了标准交叉熵、类别加权交叉熵和焦点损失三种目标函数。

Result: DistilBERT在标准交叉熵损失下在测试集上表现最佳，且参数量远少于BERT base。报告了准确率、宏F1和加权F1指标，并进行了混淆分析。

Conclusion: 建议从紧凑编码器和交叉熵开始，先添加校准和任务特定检查，再考虑使用更重的模型，为医疗NLP部署提供了实用默认方案。

Abstract: Large language models work well for many NLP tasks, but they are hard to
deploy in health settings with strict cost, latency, and privacy limits. We
revisit a lightweight recipe for medical abstract classification and ask how
far compact encoders can go under a controlled budget. Using the public medical
abstracts corpus, we finetune BERT base and DistilBERT with three objectives
standard cross-entropy, class weighted cross entropy, and focal loss keeping
tokenizer, sequence length, optimizer, and schedule fixed. DistilBERT with
plain cross-entropy gives the best balance on the test set while using far
fewer parameters than BERT base. We report accuracy, Macro F1, and Weighted F1,
release the evaluation code, and include confusion analyses to make error
patterns clear. Our results suggest a practical default: start with a compact
encoder and cross-entropy, then add calibration and task-specific checks before
moving to heavier models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HUME框架首次系统性地测量了人类在文本嵌入任务上的表现，为模型性能评估提供了人类基准，发现人类平均表现77.6%接近最佳模型80.1%，揭示了模型在低资源语言和某些数据集上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有嵌入模型评估框架缺乏可靠的人类性能基准，限制了模型得分的可解释性，难以理解模型在哪些方面真正超越或落后于人类。

Method: 开发HUME人类评估框架，在16个MTEB数据集上测量人类表现，涵盖重排序、分类、聚类和语义文本相似性任务，覆盖高资源和低资源语言。

Result: 人类平均表现77.6%，最佳模型80.1%，但存在显著差异：模型在某些数据集上接近天花板性能，在低资源语言上表现较差，揭示了数据集问题和模型局限性。

Conclusion: 提供了人类性能基准、任务难度模式洞察和可扩展评估框架，使模型评估更有意义，并为模型和基准开发提供信息。

Abstract: Comparing human and model performance offers a valuable perspective for
understanding the strengths and limitations of embedding models, highlighting
where they succeed and where they fail to capture meaning and nuance. However,
such comparisons are rarely made, as human performance on embedding tasks is
difficult to measure. To fill this gap, we introduce HUME: Human Evaluation
Framework for Text Embeddings. While frameworks like MTEB provide broad model
evaluation, they lack reliable estimates of human performance, limiting the
interpretability of model scores. We measure human performance across 16 MTEB
datasets spanning reranking, classification, clustering, and semantic textual
similarity across linguistically diverse high- and low-resource languages.
Humans achieve an average performance of 77.6% compared to 80.1% for the best
embedding model, although variation is substantial: models reach near-ceiling
performance on some datasets while struggling on others, suggesting dataset
issues and revealing shortcomings in low-resource languages. We provide human
performance baselines, insight into task difficulty patterns, and an extensible
evaluation framework that enables a more meaningful interpretation of the model
and informs the development of both models and benchmarks. Our code, dataset,
and leaderboard are publicly available at

TL;DR: CLMN是一个神经符号框架，通过连续可读的概念嵌入和模糊逻辑推理，在保持性能的同时提升NLP模型的可解释性，特别是在处理概念间动态交互方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有概念瓶颈模型在NLP中要么使用损害文本表示的二元激活，要么使用削弱语义的潜在概念，且很少建模否定和上下文等动态概念交互的问题。

Method: 将概念表示为连续、人类可读的嵌入，应用模糊逻辑推理学习自适应交互规则，通过概念感知表示增强原始文本特征，并自动推导可解释的逻辑规则。

Result: 在多个数据集和预训练语言模型上，CLMN比现有基于概念的方法获得更高准确率，同时提升解释质量。

Conclusion: 在统一概念空间中整合神经表示与符号推理可以产生实用、透明的NLP系统。

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced NLP, but interpretability remains limited,
especially in healthcare and finance. Concept bottleneck models tie predictions
to human concepts in vision, but NLP versions either use binary activations
that harm text representations or latent concepts that weaken semantics, and
they rarely model dynamic concept interactions such as negation and context. We
introduce the Concept Language Model Network (CLMN), a neural-symbolic
framework that keeps both performance and interpretability. CLMN represents
concepts as continuous, human-readable embeddings and applies fuzzy-logic
reasoning to learn adaptive interaction rules that state how concepts affect
each other and the final decision. The model augments original text features
with concept-aware representations and automatically induces interpretable
logic rules. Across multiple datasets and pre-trained language models, CLMN
achieves higher accuracy than existing concept-based methods while improving
explanation quality. These results show that integrating neural representations
with symbolic reasoning in a unified concept space can yield practical,
transparent NLP systems.

TL;DR: Unilaw-R1是一个专为法律推理设计的7B参数大语言模型，通过两阶段训练策略在权威基准测试中表现出色，性能与更大模型相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理型大语言模型在法律领域的复杂问题处理能力尚未充分探索，需要解决法律知识不足、推理逻辑不可靠和业务泛化能力弱三大挑战。

Method: 构建高质量Unilaw-R1-Data数据集（17K个CoT样本），采用监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）两阶段训练策略。

Result: 在权威基准测试中超越所有同规模模型，性能与DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B相当（54.9%），在LawBench和LexEval上平均超过Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct 6.6%。

Conclusion: Unilaw-R1以轻量级参数规模有效解决了法律推理的核心挑战，为法律AI应用提供了可解释的决策支持。

Abstract: Reasoning-focused large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving across
various domains, yet their capabilities in handling complex legal problems
remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce Unilaw-R1, a large language
model tailored for legal reasoning. With a lightweight 7-billion parameter
scale, Unilaw-R1 significantly reduces deployment cost while effectively
tackling three core challenges in the legal domain: insufficient legal
knowledge, unreliable reasoning logic, and weak business generalization. To
address these issues, we first construct Unilaw-R1-Data, a high-quality dataset
containing 17K distilled and screened chain-of-thought (CoT) samples. Based on
this, we adopt a two-stage training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), which significantly boosts the
performance on complex legal reasoning tasks and supports interpretable
decision-making in legal AI applications. To assess legal reasoning ability, we
also introduce Unilaw-R1-Eval, a dedicated benchmark designed to evaluate
models across single- and multi-choice legal tasks. Unilaw-R1 demonstrates
strong results on authoritative benchmarks, outperforming all models of similar
scale and achieving performance on par with the much larger
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B (54.9%). Following domain-specific training, it
also showed significant gains on LawBench and LexEval, exceeding
Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct (46.6%) by an average margin of 6.6%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A-IPO是一种新的偏好优化方法，通过显式建模用户提示背后的潜在意图，将意图-响应相似性纳入奖励函数，从而更好地对齐用户偏好，特别是在处理多样化和动态偏好时优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐方法如DPO往往默认多数观点，忽视了少数意见，且无法捕捉提示中的潜在用户意图。人类偏好具有多样性、动态性，受地区、文化和社会因素影响。

Method: 引入自适应意图驱动偏好优化(A-IPO)，包含意图模块推断用户提示的潜在意图，并将推断的意图显式纳入奖励函数，通过意图-响应相似性项增加偏好边界。

Result: A-IPO在多个基准测试中显著优于现有基线：Real-pref上胜率提升24.8%，响应-意图一致性提升45.6%；Attack-pref上响应相似性提升38.6%，防御成功率提升52.2%；GlobalOpinionQA-Ext上意图一致性得分提升54.6%。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模多样用户意图，A-IPO促进了多元化偏好优化，同时增强了偏好对齐的对抗鲁棒性，在理论和实证上都证明了其优越性。

Abstract: Human preferences are diverse and dynamic, shaped by regional, cultural, and
social factors. Existing alignment methods like Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) and its variants often default to majority views, overlooking minority
opinions and failing to capture latent user intentions in prompts.
  To address these limitations, we introduce \underline{\textbf{A}}daptive
\textbf{\underline{I}}ntent-driven \textbf{\underline{P}}reference
\textbf{\underline{O}}ptimization (\textbf{A-IPO}). Specifically,A-IPO
introduces an intention module that infers the latent intent behind each user
prompt and explicitly incorporates this inferred intent into the reward
function, encouraging stronger alignment between the preferred model's
responses and the user's underlying intentions. We demonstrate, both
theoretically and empirically, that incorporating an intention--response
similarity term increases the preference margin (by a positive shift of
$\lambda\,\Delta\mathrm{sim}$ in the log-odds), resulting in clearer separation
between preferred and dispreferred responses compared to DPO.
  For evaluation, we introduce two new benchmarks, Real-pref, Attack-pref along
with an extended version of an existing dataset, GlobalOpinionQA-Ext, to assess
real-world and adversarial preference alignment.
  Through explicit modeling of diverse user intents,A-IPO facilitates
pluralistic preference optimization while simultaneously enhancing adversarial
robustness in preference alignment. Comprehensive empirical evaluation
demonstrates that A-IPO consistently surpasses existing baselines, yielding
substantial improvements across key metrics: up to +24.8 win-rate and +45.6
Response-Intention Consistency on Real-pref; up to +38.6 Response Similarity
and +52.2 Defense Success Rate on Attack-pref; and up to +54.6 Intention
Consistency Score on GlobalOpinionQA-Ext.

TL;DR: 提出PerAugy数据增强技术，通过跨轨迹混洗和摘要内容扰动提升个性化摘要模型的性能，在四个SOTA用户编码器上显著提高准确率，并引入三个多样性指标验证数据多样性对性能提升的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化摘要面临训练数据稀缺的挑战，现有MS/CAS PENS数据集缺乏目标摘要且主题转换多样性有限，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 提出PerAugy数据增强技术，包括跨轨迹混洗和摘要内容扰动，用于生成多样化的训练数据。

Result: PerAugy显著提升了四个SOTA用户编码器的准确率（最佳结果：AUC提升0.132），增强后的摘要框架个性化程度平均提升61.2%。

Conclusion: 数据多样性是提升个性化摘要性能的关键因素，PerAugy通过增加数据集多样性有效解决了训练数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Document summarization enables efficient extraction of user-relevant content
but is inherently shaped by individual subjectivity, making it challenging to
identify subjective salient information in multifaceted documents. This
complexity underscores the necessity for personalized summarization. However,
training models for personalized summarization has so far been challenging,
particularly because diverse training data containing both user preference
history (i.e., click-skip trajectory) and expected (gold-reference) summaries
are scarce. The MS/CAS PENS dataset is a valuable resource but includes only
preference history without target summaries, preventing end-to-end supervised
learning, and its limited topic-transition diversity further restricts
generalization. To address this, we propose $\mathrm{PerAugy}$, a novel
cross-trajectory shuffling and summary-content perturbation based data
augmentation technique that significantly boosts the accuracy of four
state-of-the-art baseline (SOTA) user-encoders commonly used in personalized
summarization frameworks (best result: $\text{0.132}$$\uparrow$ w.r.t AUC). We
select two such SOTA summarizer frameworks as baselines and observe that when
augmented with their corresponding improved user-encoders, they consistently
show an increase in personalization (avg. boost: $\text{61.2\%}\uparrow$ w.r.t.
PSE-SU4 metric). As a post-hoc analysis of the role of induced diversity in the
augmented dataset by \peraugy, we introduce three dataset diversity metrics --
$\mathrm{TP}$, $\mathrm{RTC}$, and \degreed\ to quantify the induced diversity.
We find that $\mathrm{TP}$ and $\mathrm{DegreeD}$ strongly correlate with
user-encoder performance on the PerAugy-generated dataset across all accuracy
metrics, indicating that increased dataset diversity is a key factor driving
performance gains.

TL;DR: REFRAIN是一个无需训练的自适应推理停止框架，通过两阶段停止判别器和滑动窗口UCB多臂老虎机控制器，动态调整停止阈值以减少过度推理，在保持或提高准确性的同时减少20-55%的token使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought推理虽然提升了LLMs在推理任务上的表现，但过度或冗余的推理会增加推理成本并导致错误结论，需要解决"何时停止推理"的问题。

Method: REFRAIN整合了两阶段停止判别器来识别反思性但冗余的推理，以及滑动窗口UCB多臂老虎机控制器来根据问题难度动态调整停止阈值，无需监督或微调。

Result: 在四个代表性基准测试和两个模型家族上，REFRAIN相比标准CoT提示减少了20-55%的token使用，同时保持或提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了"何时停止"作为测试时扩展的新实践维度，使模型能够进行适量而非过度的推理。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has driven recent gains of large language
models (LLMs) on reasoning-intensive tasks by externalizing intermediate steps.
However, excessive or redundant reasoning -- so-called overthinking -- can
increase inference costs and lead LLMs toward incorrect conclusions. In this
paper, we present REFRAIN ($\underline{REF}$lective-$\underline{R}$edundancy
for $\underline{A}$daptive $\underline{IN}$ference), a training-free framework
that adaptively determines when to stop reasoning to mitigate overthinking.
REFRAIN integrates a two-stage stop discriminator to identify reflective yet
redundant reasoning and a sliding-window Upper Confidence Bound (SW-UCB)
multi-armed bandit controller to dynamically adjust stopping thresholds
according to problem difficulty without supervision or fine-tuning. Across four
representative benchmarks and two model families, REFRAIN reduces token usage
by 20-55% while maintaining or improving accuracy compared to standard CoT
prompting. Extensive ablation and robustness analyses demonstrate its stability
across models, scorers, and prompt variations. In summary, our findings
highlight when-to-stop as a new and practical axis of test-time scaling --
enabling models to reason not just more, but just enough.

TL;DR: 提出了LinearRAG框架，通过构建无关系层次图（Tri-Graph）和两阶段检索策略，解决了传统GraphRAG方法中关系提取不稳定且成本高的问题，实现了高效可靠的检索增强生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于知识图谱的RAG系统依赖不稳定且成本高昂的关系提取来构建图，往往产生噪声图，包含错误或不一致的关系，从而降低检索质量。

Method: LinearRAG构建无关系层次图（Tri-Graph），仅使用轻量级实体提取和语义链接，避免不稳定的关系建模。采用两阶段检索策略：通过局部语义桥接激活相关实体，然后通过全局重要性聚合进行段落检索。

Result: 在四个数据集上的广泛实验表明，LinearRAG显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: LinearRAG提供了一种经济可靠的原始段落索引方法，图构建规模与语料库大小呈线性关系，且不产生额外token消耗，为复杂多跳推理任务提供了更全面的检索能力。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely used to mitigate
hallucinations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging external
knowledge. While effective for simple queries, traditional RAG systems struggle
with large-scale, unstructured corpora where information is fragmented. Recent
advances incorporate knowledge graphs to capture relational structures,
enabling more comprehensive retrieval for complex, multi-hop reasoning tasks.
However, existing graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) methods rely on unstable and
costly relation extraction for graph construction, often producing noisy graphs
with incorrect or inconsistent relations that degrade retrieval quality. In
this paper, we revisit the pipeline of existing GraphRAG systems and propose
LinearRAG (Linear Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation), an efficient
framework that enables reliable graph construction and precise passage
retrieval. Specifically, LinearRAG constructs a relation-free hierarchical
graph, termed Tri-Graph, using only lightweight entity extraction and semantic
linking, avoiding unstable relation modeling. This new paradigm of graph
construction scales linearly with corpus size and incurs no extra token
consumption, providing an economical and reliable indexing of the original
passages. For retrieval, LinearRAG adopts a two-stage strategy: (i) relevant
entity activation via local semantic bridging, followed by (ii) passage
retrieval through global importance aggregation. Extensive experiments on four
datasets demonstrate that LinearRAG significantly outperforms baseline models.

Motivation: 解决企业文档处理中大量结构相似内容的信息提取挑战，现有方法追求通用解决方案但效果有限，需要利用文档特定特征进行优化。

Method: 开发了系统框架，结合OCR引擎和LLM，实现三种提取范式（直接、替换、表格基），通过智能策略选择和格式感知路由处理异构文档流。

Result: 表格基提取方法在结构化文档中实现F1=1.0准确率和0.97秒延迟，在图像输入中实现F1=0.997准确率和0.6秒延迟，相比朴素方法性能提升54倍。

Conclusion: 重复性文档处理任务的计算负担可以通过结构感知方法选择转化为优化机会，这一原则具有普遍适用性。

Abstract: Information extraction from copy-heavy documents, characterized by massive
volumes of structurally similar content, represents a critical yet understudied
challenge in enterprise document processing. We present a systematic framework
that strategically combines OCR engines with Large Language Models (LLMs) to
optimize the accuracy-efficiency trade-off inherent in repetitive document
extraction tasks. Unlike existing approaches that pursue universal solutions,
our method exploits document-specific characteristics through intelligent
strategy selection. We implement and evaluate 25 configurations across three
extraction paradigms (direct, replacement, and table-based) on identity
documents spanning four formats (PNG, DOCX, XLSX, PDF). Through table-based
extraction methods, our adaptive framework delivers outstanding results: F1=1.0
accuracy with 0.97s latency for structured documents, and F1=0.997 accuracy
with 0.6 s for challenging image inputs when integrated with PaddleOCR, all
while maintaining sub-second processing speeds. The 54 times performance
improvement compared with multimodal methods over naive approaches, coupled
with format-aware routing, enables processing of heterogeneous document streams
at production scale. Beyond the specific application to identity extraction,
this work establishes a general principle: the repetitive nature of copy-heavy
tasks can be transformed from a computational burden into an optimization
opportunity through structure-aware method selection.

Motivation: 现有工作主要关注偏见输出的出现时机，但缺乏对生成机制的深入理解，导致现有缓解方法脆弱。需要系统研究LLM不公平性并开发有效的去偏见方法。

Method: 1. 比较DA和CoT提示在8个代表性LLM中的表现；2. 定义token-to-head贡献分数追踪偏见来源；3. 提出DiffHeads框架，通过差异激活分析识别偏见头并选择性屏蔽。

Result: DA提示触发LLM自然偏见，不公平性增加534.5%-391.9%；发现偏见头集群在DA下激活但在CoT下休眠；DiffHeads在DA和CoT下分别减少不公平性49.4%和40.3%，且不影响模型效用。

Conclusion: DiffHeads提供了一种轻量级、有效的LLM去偏见方法，通过因果机制分析实现了偏见缓解，为理解和管理LLM偏见提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate decisions in domains where
unfair treatment of demographic groups is unacceptable. Existing work probes
when biased outputs appear, but gives little insight into the mechanisms that
generate them, leaving existing mitigations largely fragile. In this paper, we
conduct a systematic investigation LLM unfairness and propose DiffHeads, a
lightweight debiasing framework for LLMs. We first compare Direct-Answer (DA)
prompting to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting across eight representative open-
and closed-source LLMs. DA will trigger the nature bias part of LLM and improve
measured unfairness by 534.5%-391.9% in both one-turn and two-turn dialogues.
Next, we define a token-to-head contribution score that traces each token's
influence back to individual attention heads. This reveals a small cluster of
bias heads that activate under DA but stay largely dormant with CoT, providing
the first causal link between prompting strategy and bias emergence. Finally,
building on this insight, we propose DiffHeads that identifies bias heads
through differential activation analysis between DA and CoT, and selectively
masks only those heads. DiffHeads reduces unfairness by 49.4%, and 40.3% under
DA and CoT, respectively, without harming model utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多LLM系统虽然能增强语言模型的创造力，但存在计算成本高和推理延迟大的问题。需要一种方法能在单模型中实现多模型协作的优势。

Method: 在模型激活空间中提取多个不同角色向量，将这些向量融合后用于引导生成过程，实现多视角输出而无需多LLM显式通信。

Result: 在创意导向基准测试中，BILLY超越了单模型提示和传统多LLM方法，同时大幅减少了推理时间和计算成本。

Conclusion: 不同角色向量的融合既能有效控制生成的互补方面，又能提高可解释性，为单模型实现多视角能力提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Multi-LLM systems enhance the creativity of large language models by
simulating human collective intelligence but suffer from significant drawbacks,
such as high computational costs and inference latency. To address these
limitations, we propose BILLY (BlendIng persona vectors for Large Language
model creativitY), a training-free framework that captures the benefits of
multi-LLM collaboration, i.e. inducing diverse perspectives and specialized
expertise, within a single model. BILLY operates by extracting and blending
multiple distinct persona vectors directly in the model's activation space. We
steer the model's generation process with this merged vector while inference,
enabling multi-perspective output without explicit multi-LLM communication. Our
experiments across creativity-oriented benchmarks demonstrate that BILLY
surpasses single model prompting and traditional multi-LLM approaches, while
substantially reducing inference time and computational costs. Our analyses
further reveal that distinct persona vectors can be blended to achieve both
effective control over complementary aspects of generation and greater
interpretability.

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统调查了大型语言模型生成内容的溯源追踪，围绕模型和数据两个视角构建了四个相互关联的维度框架，并提出基于先验和后验的双重范式分类法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs从支持客观任务转向赋能主观决策，其部署带来了幻觉、偏见、不公平和版权侵权等多方面风险。由于LLMs的黑盒特性和生成内容的人类相似性，从多角度溯源信息变得至关重要。

Method: 构建了四个维度的溯源框架：模型视角的模型溯源和模型结构溯源，数据视角的训练数据溯源和外部数据溯源。同时提出先验基础（主动嵌入可追溯性）和后验基础（回顾性推断）的双重范式分类法。

Result: 建立了一个系统性的LLMs生成内容溯源追踪调查框架，涵盖了模型和数据两个核心视角，为增强LLMs部署的透明度、问责制和可信度提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 跨这些维度的可追溯性能够增强LLMs在现实世界应用中的透明度、问责制和可信度，对于安全可靠地部署LLMs具有重要意义。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized
artificial intelligence, shifting from supporting objective tasks (e.g.,
recognition) to empowering subjective decision-making (e.g., planning,
decision). This marks the dawn of general and powerful AI, with applications
spanning a wide range of fields, including programming, education, healthcare,
finance, and law. However, their deployment introduces multifaceted risks. Due
to the black-box nature of LLMs and the human-like quality of their generated
content, issues such as hallucinations, bias, unfairness, and copyright
infringement become particularly significant. In this context, sourcing
information from multiple perspectives is essential.
  This survey presents a systematic investigation into provenance tracking for
content generated by LLMs, organized around four interrelated dimensions that
together capture both model- and data-centric perspectives. From the model
perspective, Model Sourcing treats the model as a whole, aiming to distinguish
content generated by specific LLMs from content authored by humans. Model
Structure Sourcing delves into the internal generative mechanisms, analyzing
architectural components that shape the outputs of model. From the data
perspective, Training Data Sourcing focuses on internal attribution, tracing
the origins of generated content back to the training data of model. In
contrast, External Data Sourcing emphasizes external validation, identifying
external information used to support or influence the responses of model.
Moreover, we also propose a dual-paradigm taxonomy that classifies existing
sourcing methods into prior-based (proactive traceability embedding) and
posterior-based (retrospective inference) approaches. Traceability across these
dimensions enhances the transparency, accountability, and trustworthiness of
LLMs deployment in real-world applications.

Abstract: Reasoning is an important task for large language models (LLMs). Among all
the reasoning paradigms, inductive reasoning is one of the fundamental types,
which is characterized by its particular-to-general thinking process and the
non-uniqueness of its answers. The inductive mode is crucial for knowledge
generalization and aligns better with human cognition, so it is a fundamental
mode of learning, hence attracting increasing interest. Despite the importance
of inductive reasoning, there is no systematic summary of it. Therefore, this
paper presents the first comprehensive survey of inductive reasoning for LLMs.
First, methods for improving inductive reasoning are categorized into three
main areas: post-training, test-time scaling, and data augmentation. Then,
current benchmarks of inductive reasoning are summarized, and a unified
sandbox-based evaluation approach with the observation coverage metric is
derived. Finally, we offer some analyses regarding the source of inductive
ability and how simple model architectures and data help with inductive tasks,
providing a solid foundation for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的多智能体医疗咨询系统评估通常只关注最终答案准确性，将其内部协作过程视为黑箱，这在高风险医疗应用中存在重大风险，可能导致不可靠的诊断结论。

Method: 对六个医疗数据集和六个代表性多智能体框架的3,600个案例进行大规模实证研究，采用结合定性分析和定量审计的混合方法，建立了协作失败模式的综合分类法。

Result: 定量审计揭示了四种主要失败模式：共享模型缺陷驱动的错误共识、正确少数意见被压制、无效讨论动态以及合成过程中的关键信息丢失。

Conclusion: 仅靠高准确性不足以建立临床或公众信任，迫切需要透明可审计的推理过程，这是负责任开发和部署医疗AI的基石。

Abstract: While large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems show promise in
simulating medical consultations, their evaluation is often confined to
final-answer accuracy. This practice treats their internal collaborative
processes as opaque "black boxes" and overlooks a critical question: is a
diagnostic conclusion reached through a sound and verifiable reasoning pathway?
The inscrutable nature of these systems poses a significant risk in high-stakes
medical applications, potentially leading to flawed or untrustworthy
conclusions. To address this, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of 3,600
cases from six medical datasets and six representative multi-agent frameworks.
Through a rigorous, mixed-methods approach combining qualitative analysis with
quantitative auditing, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of collaborative
failure modes. Our quantitative audit reveals four dominant failure patterns:
flawed consensus driven by shared model deficiencies, suppression of correct
minority opinions, ineffective discussion dynamics, and critical information
loss during synthesis. This study demonstrates that high accuracy alone is an
insufficient measure of clinical or public trust. It highlights the urgent need
for transparent and auditable reasoning processes, a cornerstone for the
responsible development and deployment of medical AI.

TL;DR: Delora是一个新颖的框架，通过解耦样本选择和模型训练来解决带噪声标签的LLM微调问题。它使用干净和噪声LoRA来建立噪声标签检测器，有效识别干净和噪声样本，从而提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中训练数据往往包含噪声标签，传统方法通过小损失样本选择进行训练，但初始选择不准确会形成恶性循环，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出Delora框架：1）样本选择阶段引入干净和噪声LoRA，利用记忆效应分别记忆干净和噪声数据；2）模型训练阶段使用精心选择的样本微调语言模型。

Result: 在合成和真实噪声数据集上的实验表明，Delora在噪声标签检测和文本分类任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: Delora通过解耦样本选择和模型训练，有效解决了带噪声标签的LLM微调问题，在噪声环境下展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) large language models (LLMs) have
shown impressive performance in various downstream tasks. However, in many
real-world scenarios, the collected training data inevitably contains noisy
labels. To learn from noisy labels, most solutions select samples with small
losses for model training. However, the selected samples, in turn, impact the
loss computation in the next iteration. An inaccurate initial selection can
create a vicious cycle, leading to suboptimal performance. To break this cycle,
we propose Delora, a novel framework that decouples the sample selection from
model training. For sample selection, Delora establishes a noisy label detector
by introducing clean and noisy LoRA. Benefiting from the memory effect, the
clean LoRA is encouraged to memorize clean data, while the noisy LoRA is
constrained to memorize mislabeled data, which serves as a learnable threshold
for selecting clean and noisy samples. For model training, Delora can use
carefully selected samples to fine-tune language models seamlessly.
Experimental results on synthetic and real-world noisy datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Delora in noisy label detection and text classification.

TL;DR: SyTTA是一个无需标签的测试时适应框架，通过结合输入侧困惑度和输出侧预测熵来应对语言模型在专业领域的分布偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在专业领域部署时面临训练数据分布偏移的挑战，而领域特定微调需要高质量标注数据，这在专业知识有限的场景中成本高昂且收集缓慢。

Method: SyTTA框架在推理时动态适应模型，无需额外监督。它耦合两种互补的不确定性信号：输入侧困惑度（反映与领域特定术语和模式的不匹配）和输出侧预测熵（反映生成过程中令牌概率的扩散和不稳定性）。

Result: 在不同模型架构和领域特定基准测试中，SyTTA均带来一致提升。在农业问答任务上，SyTTA将Qwen-2.5-7B的Rouge-LSum提高了120%以上，每个查询仅需4个额外令牌。

Conclusion: 研究证明无需标注示例即可实现语言模型的有效测试时适应，支持在标签稀缺领域的部署。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in specialized domains
such as finance, medicine, and agriculture, where they face significant
distribution shifts from their training data. Domain-specific fine-tuning can
mitigate this challenge but relies on high-quality labeled data that is
expensive and slow to collect in expertise-limited settings. We study
label-free test-time adaptation for language models and present SyTTA, an
inference-time framework that adapts models on-the-fly without additional
supervision. SyTTA couples two complementary uncertainty signals that arise
under distribution shift: input-side perplexity, indicating mismatch with
domain-specific terminology and patterns, and output-side predictive entropy,
indicating diffuse and unstable token probabilities during generation. Across
diverse model architectures and domain-specific benchmarks, SyTTA delivers
consistent gains. Notably, on agricultural question answering, SyTTA improves
Rouge-LSum by over 120% on Qwen-2.5-7B with only 4 extra tokens per query.
These results show that effective test-time adaptation for language models is
achievable without labeled examples, supporting deployment in label-scarce
domains. The code will be made available upon acceptance.

Motivation: 研究发现高质量文本表示与输入文本的关键token对齐，揭示了表示空间和词汇空间之间的潜在联系，这启发了重新审视生成任务用于文本表示学习。

Method: 提出Text2Token框架，基于token目标预测任务，使用精心构建的目标token分布作为监督信号。通过分析token对齐特性，识别两类关键token：文本中有意义的token和文本之外的语义衍生token，并提出数据驱动和模型衍生两种方法来构建合成token目标。

Result: 在MTEB v2基准测试中，Text2Token达到了与最先进的无监督对比学习方法LLM2Vec竞争的性能。

Conclusion: 分析表明词汇空间和表示空间在训练过程中共同优化并趋向最优解，为未来工作提供了新的思路和见解。

Abstract: Unsupervised text representation learning (TRL) is a fundamental task in
natural language processing, which is beneficial for improving search and
recommendations with the web's unlabeled texts. A recent empirical study finds
that the high-quality representation aligns with the key token of the input
text, uncovering the potential connection between representation space and
vocabulary space. Inspired by the findings, we revisit the generative tasks and
develop an unsupervised generative framework for TRL, Text2Token. The framework
is based on the token target prediction task, utilizing carefully constructed
target token distribution as supervisory signals. To construct the high-quality
target token distribution, we analyze the token-alignment properties with
advanced embedders and identify two essential categories of key tokens: (1) the
meaningful tokens in the text and (2) semantically derived tokens beyond the
text. Based on these insights, we propose two methods -- data-driven and
model-derived -- to construct synthetic token targets from data or the LLM
backbone. Experiments on the MTEB v2 benchmark demonstrate that Text2Token
achieves performance competitive with the state-of-the-art embedder with
unsupervised contrastive learning, LLM2Vec. Our analysis further shows that
vocabulary and representation spaces optimize together and toward the optimum
solution during training, providing new ideas and insights for future work.

Motivation: 解决当前共指消解研究面临的困境：是继续探索基于小语言模型的监督神经方法，还是拥抱大语言模型的能力，以及如何有效结合两者的优势

Method: 1. 改进的监督CR方法(ImCoref)：引入轻量级桥接模块增强长文本编码，设计双仿射评分器全面捕捉位置信息，采用混合提及正则化提高训练效率；2. LLM作为多角色检查器-分割器代理，验证候选提及和共指结果

Conclusion: 提出的ImCoref-CeS框架成功结合了监督神经方法和LLM的优势，在共指消解任务中取得了突破性进展

Abstract: Coreference Resolution (CR) is a critical task in Natural Language Processing
(NLP). Current research faces a key dilemma: whether to further explore the
potential of supervised neural methods based on small language models, whose
detect-then-cluster pipeline still delivers top performance, or embrace the
powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, effectively
combining their strengths remains underexplored. To this end, we propose
\textbf{ImCoref-CeS}, a novel framework that integrates an enhanced supervised
model with LLM-based reasoning. First, we present an improved CR method
(\textbf{ImCoref}) to push the performance boundaries of the supervised neural
method by introducing a lightweight bridging module to enhance long-text
encoding capability, devising a biaffine scorer to comprehensively capture
positional information, and invoking a hybrid mention regularization to improve
training efficiency. Importantly, we employ an LLM acting as a multi-role
Checker-Splitter agent to validate candidate mentions (filtering out invalid
ones) and coreference results (splitting erroneous clusters) predicted by
ImCoref. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ImCoref-CeS,
which achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods.

TL;DR: AoU框架通过分解查询、验证假设和约束推理来减少LLM中的推理诱导幻觉，在数学推理任务上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在推理过程中基于未经验证假设产生幻觉的问题，现有方法主要关注事实性幻觉或事后验证，缺乏对推理过程本身的有效约束。

Method: 提出理解审计框架，包含三个阶段：将查询分解为候选假设、审计假设支持度、仅基于已验证子集进行推理，形式化为后验约束推理。

Result: 在GSM8K、MultiArith和SVAMP数据集上显著提升准确性和忠实度，相比Chain-of-Thought等方法获得+20-45%的改进。

Conclusion: AoU通过约束推理于已验证前提，有效减少推理诱导幻觉，提供理论保证并在实践中表现出色。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate reasoning traces that appear
coherent but rest on unsupported assumptions, leading to hallucinated
conclusions. Prior work mainly addresses factual hallucinations or relies on
post-hoc verification, leaving reasoning-induced hallucinations largely
unaddressed. We propose Audit-of-Understanding (AoU), a framework that
constrains inference to validated premises through three phases: (1)
decomposing a query into candidate assumptions, (2) auditing their support, and
(3) conditioning inference only on the validated subset. Formally, AoU is
\emph{posterior-constrained inference}, connecting to selective prediction and
rejection learning. Our contributions are threefold: (i) theoretical guarantees
under perfect validation, (ii) excess-risk bounds under imperfect audits, and
(iii) tractability analysis. Empirically, AoU improves both accuracy and
faithfulness on GSM8K, MultiArith, and SVAMP, achieving up to +30% gains on
GSM8K, +45% on MultiArith, and consistent +20--28% improvements on SVAMP over
Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and CoT-Decoding. Code is available at

Motivation: 后门攻击对大型语言模型构成重大威胁，现有防御方法依赖不切实际的触发设置假设，需要一种无需先验知识的实用防御方案。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先通过注入已知触发器聚合后门表示，然后进行恢复微调以恢复良性输出。

Result: 在多个基准测试中将平均攻击成功率降至4.41%，优于现有基线28.1%~69.3%；清洁准确率和实用性保持在原始模型0.5%以内；防御方法对不同类型后门具有泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该防御框架在无需触发设置先验知识的情况下有效对抗后门攻击，保持模型性能的同时显著降低攻击成功率，具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks are a significant threat to large language models (LLMs),
often embedded via public checkpoints, yet existing defenses rely on
impractical assumptions about trigger settings. To address this challenge, we
propose \ourmethod, a defense framework that requires no prior knowledge of
trigger settings. \ourmethod is based on the key observation that when
deliberately injecting known backdoors into an already-compromised model, both
existing unknown and newly injected backdoors aggregate in the representation
space. \ourmethod leverages this through a two-stage process: \textbf{first},
aggregating backdoor representations by injecting known triggers, and
\textbf{then}, performing recovery fine-tuning to restore benign outputs.
Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that: (I)
\ourmethod reduces the average Attack Success Rate to 4.41\% across multiple
benchmarks, outperforming existing baselines by 28.1\%$\sim$69.3\%$\uparrow$.
(II) Clean accuracy and utility are preserved within 0.5\% of the original
model, ensuring negligible impact on legitimate tasks. (III) The defense
generalizes across different types of backdoors, confirming its robustness in
practical deployment scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大语言模型需要在不同语言间保持事实知识的一致性，但目前对这种一致性失败的原因理解不足。研究者假设这可能是由于实体对齐失败导致的。

Method: 通过实体级翻译任务评估对齐情况，并提出SubSub和SubInj两种方法，将英语主语翻译整合到多语言提示中，以改善实体表示对齐。

Result: 研究发现一致性与对齐在所有模型中强相关，提出的方法显著提高了事实回忆准确性和一致性，并通过机制分析揭示了这些干预如何通过模型内部枢纽语言处理来强化实体表示对齐。

Conclusion: 实体对齐是多语言事实预测一致性的关键因素，提出的方法提供了改善多语言事实预测的有效实用策略。

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) are expected to recall factual
knowledge consistently across languages. However, the factors that give rise to
such crosslingual consistency -- and its frequent failure -- remain poorly
understood. In this work, we hypothesize that these inconsistencies may arise
from failures in entity alignment, the process of mapping subject and object
entities into a shared conceptual space across languages. To test this, we
assess alignment through entity-level (subject and object) translation tasks,
and find that consistency is strongly correlated with alignment across all
studied models, with misalignment of subjects or objects frequently resulting
in inconsistencies. Building on this insight, we propose SubSub and SubInj, two
effective methods that integrate English translations of subjects into prompts
across languages, leading to substantial gains in both factual recall accuracy
and consistency. Finally, our mechanistic analysis reveals that these
interventions reinforce the entity representation alignment in the conceptual
space through model's internal pivot-language processing, offering effective
and practical strategies for improving multilingual factual prediction.

Conclusion: 为高级语言模型的高效可扩展测试时推理策略设计提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a promising paradigm in language modeling,
wherein additional computational resources are allocated during inference to
enhance model performance. Recent approaches, such as DeepConf, have
demonstrated the efficacy of this strategy, however, they often incur
substantial computational overhead to achieve competitive results. In this
work, we propose MatryoshkaThinking, a novel method that significantly reduces
computational cost while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.
Specifically, MatryoshkaThinking attains a score of 99.79 on AIME2025 using
only 4% of the computation required by DeepConf. The core of our approach lies
in the recursive exploitation of the model's intrinsic capabilities in
reasoning, verification, and summarization, which collectively enhance the
retention of correct solutions and reduce the disparity between Pass@k and
Pass@1. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple open-source models and
challenging multi-modal reasoning benchmarks validate the effectiveness and
generality of our method. These findings offer new insights into the design of
efficient and scalable test-time inference strategies for advanced language
models.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能在不同人口统计群体中展现公平的共情能力，因为情感体验受到人口和文化背景的影响。

Method: 提出了一个分析框架，对315个由年龄、文化和性别组合而成的独特用户角色进行交叉分析，覆盖四个LLMs，结合定量和定性方法。

Result: 属性显著影响模型的共情反应，多个属性同时存在时会减弱甚至逆转预期的共情模式。模型总体上反映了现实世界的共情趋势，但对某些群体（如儒家文化）存在明显偏差。

Conclusion: 设计具有共情意识的LLMs需要考虑人口多样性，以促进更具包容性和公平性的模型行为。

Abstract: Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to converse naturally is empowered by
their ability to empathetically understand and respond to their users. However,
emotional experiences are shaped by demographic and cultural contexts. This
raises an important question: Can LLMs demonstrate equitable empathy across
diverse user groups? We propose a framework to investigate how LLMs' cognitive
and affective empathy vary across user personas defined by intersecting
demographic attributes. Our study introduces a novel intersectional analysis
spanning 315 unique personas, constructed from combinations of age, culture,
and gender, across four LLMs. Results show that attributes profoundly shape a
model's empathetic responses. Interestingly, we see that adding multiple
attributes at once can attenuate and reverse expected empathy patterns. We show
that they broadly reflect real-world empathetic trends, with notable
misalignments for certain groups, such as those from Confucian culture. We
complement our quantitative findings with qualitative insights to uncover model
behaviour patterns across different demographic groups. Our findings highlight
the importance of designing empathy-aware LLMs that account for demographic
diversity to promote more inclusive and equitable model behaviour.

Conclusion: 该工具填补了二语能力测量工具的空白，为系统化分析论元结构构式提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Argument structure constructions (ASCs) offer a theoretically grounded lens
for analyzing second language (L2) proficiency, yet scalable and systematic
tools for measuring their usage remain limited. This paper introduces the ASC
analyzer, a publicly available Python package designed to address this gap. The
analyzer automatically tags ASCs and computes 50 indices that capture
diversity, proportion, frequency, and ASC-verb lemma association strength. To
demonstrate its utility, we conduct both bivariate and multivariate analyses
that examine the relationship between ASC-based indices and L2 writing scores.

*Aashiq Muhamed,Leonardo F. R. Ribeiro,Markus Dreyer,Virginia Smith,Mona T. Diab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了RAG系统中语言模型基于有缺陷上下文选择性拒绝回答的能力，发现前沿模型在此任务上表现不佳，拒绝准确率低于50%。作者提出了RefusalBench生成式评估框架，通过语言扰动创建诊断测试案例，揭示了系统性的失败模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统中语言模型基于有缺陷上下文选择性拒绝回答的能力对安全性至关重要，但目前仍是显著的失败点。静态基准无法可靠评估这一能力，因为模型会利用数据集特定特征和记忆测试实例。

Method: 引入RefusalBench生成式方法，通过受控语言扰动程序化创建诊断测试案例。该框架采用176种不同扰动策略，涵盖六类信息不确定性和三个强度级别。评估了30多个模型。

Result: 发现拒绝能力包含可分离的检测和分类技能，规模和扩展推理都无法提升性能。选择性拒绝是可训练、对齐敏感的能力。拒绝准确率在多文档任务中低于50%，模型表现出危险过度自信或过度谨慎。

Conclusion: 选择性拒绝是可训练的对齐敏感能力，提供了明确的改进路径。发布了RefusalBench-NQ（单文档）和RefusalBench-GaRAGe（多文档）两个基准以及完整的生成框架，支持这一关键能力的持续动态评估。

Abstract: The ability of language models in RAG systems to selectively refuse to answer
based on flawed context is critical for safety, yet remains a significant
failure point. Our large-scale study reveals that even frontier models struggle
in this setting, with refusal accuracy dropping below 50% on multi-document
tasks, while exhibiting either dangerous overconfidence or overcaution. Static
benchmarks fail to reliably evaluate this capability, as models exploit
dataset-specific artifacts and memorize test instances. We introduce
RefusalBench, a generative methodology that programmatically creates diagnostic
test cases through controlled linguistic perturbation. Our framework employs
176 distinct perturbation strategies across six categories of informational
uncertainty and three intensity levels. Evaluation of over 30 models uncovers
systematic failure patterns: refusal comprises separable detection and
categorization skills, and neither scale nor extended reasoning improves
performance. We find that selective refusal is a trainable, alignment-sensitive
capability, offering a clear path for improvement. We release two benchmarks --
RefusalBench-NQ (single document) and RefusalBench-GaRAGe (multi-document) --
and our complete generation framework to enable continued, dynamic evaluation
of this critical capability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AssoMem是一个新颖的关联记忆图框架，通过自动提取线索将对话话语锚定，整合多维检索信号（相关性、重要性和时间对齐），在相似密集场景中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模记忆中准确回忆的核心挑战，特别是在相似密集场景中，现有方法主要依赖与查询的语义距离进行检索，而人类是通过关联链接信息。

Method: 构建关联记忆图，将对话话语锚定到自动提取的线索上，整合相关性、重要性和时间对齐等多维检索信号，采用自适应互信息驱动的融合策略。

Result: 在三个基准测试和新引入的MeetingQA数据集上的广泛实验表明，AssoMem始终优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: AssoMem在上下文感知记忆回忆方面具有优越性，验证了其在大规模记忆增强AI助手问答任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Accurate recall from large scale memories remains a core challenge for memory
augmented AI assistants performing question answering (QA), especially in
similarity dense scenarios where existing methods mainly rely on semantic
distance to the query for retrieval. Inspired by how humans link information
associatively, we propose AssoMem, a novel framework constructing an
associative memory graph that anchors dialogue utterances to automatically
extracted clues. This structure provides a rich organizational view of the
conversational context and facilitates importance aware ranking. Further,
AssoMem integrates multi-dimensional retrieval signals-relevance, importance,
and temporal alignment using an adaptive mutual information (MI) driven fusion
strategy. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks and a newly introduced
dataset, MeetingQA, demonstrate that AssoMem consistently outperforms SOTA
baselines, verifying its superiority in context-aware memory recall.

*Geunyeong Jeong,Juoh Sun,Seonghee Lee,Harksoo Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了STEAM框架，通过语义级知识编辑增强更新知识在模型知识结构中的整合，解决现有方法在语义连贯性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑方法主要关注词级似然优化，缺乏语义连贯性考虑，导致编辑后的知识在潜在空间中孤立存在，无法融入自然推理过程。

Method: STEAM首先识别目标表示作为更新事实关联的语义锚点，然后通过对齐损失在优化过程中引导编辑事实的内部表示向这些锚点靠拢。

Result: 实验结果表明STEAM提高了模型使用编辑知识进行推理的能力，并增强了语义连贯性。

Conclusion: 潜在空间对齐对于可靠和连贯的知识编辑至关重要，STEAM框架为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models store extensive factual knowledge acquired during
large-scale pre-training. However, this knowledge is inherently static,
reflecting only the state of the world at the time of training. Knowledge
editing has emerged as a promising solution for updating outdated or incorrect
facts without full retraining. However, most existing locate-and-edit methods
primarily focus on token-level likelihood optimization without addressing
semantic coherence. Our analysis reveals that such edited knowledge is often
encoded as isolated residual streams in the model's latent space, distinct from
pre-existing knowledge and bypassing natural reasoning process. To address
this, we propose \textsc{Steam}, a semantic-level knowledge editing framework
that enhances integration of updated knowledge into the model's knowledge
structure. \textsc{Steam} first identifies target representations as semantic
anchors for the updated factual association, then guides the internal
representation of the edited fact towards these anchors through an alignment
loss during optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that \textsc{Steam}
improves model's ability to reason with edited knowledge and enhances semantic
coherence, underscoring the importance of latent-space alignment for reliable
and coherent knowledge editing. The code is available at

*Federica Bologna,Tiffany Pan,Matthew Wilkens,Yue Guo,Lucy Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongQAEval是一个针对临床长问答系统的评估框架，通过比较粗粒度答案级和细粒度句子级评估方法，发现在正确性维度上细粒度标注效果更好，相关性维度上粗粒度更好，安全性维度则难以达成一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估临床长问答系统需要医学专业知识且资源密集，人工判断长文本的一致性难以保证，因此需要开发在有限资源和高专业知识环境下的有效评估方法。

Method: 基于300个真实患者问题（由医生和LLM回答）的医生标注，比较了答案级和句子级评估在正确性、相关性和安全性三个维度上的表现，并测试了仅标注部分句子的可行性。

Result: 不同维度的标注者间一致性不同：细粒度标注在正确性维度上一致性更高，粗粒度标注在相关性维度上更好，安全性维度的一致性始终较差。仅标注部分句子可以达到与粗粒度标注相当的可靠性。

Conclusion: LongQAEval提供了实用的临床长问答评估建议，通过选择合适的评估粒度和维度，可以在保持可靠性的同时显著降低评估成本。

Abstract: Evaluating long-form clinical question answering (QA) systems is
resource-intensive and challenging: accurate judgments require medical
expertise and achieving consistent human judgments over long-form text is
difficult. We introduce LongQAEval, an evaluation framework and set of
evaluation recommendations for limited-resource and high-expertise settings.
Based on physician annotations of 300 real patient questions answered by
physicians and LLMs, we compare coarse answer-level versus fine-grained
sentence-level evaluation over the dimensions of correctness, relevance, and
safety. We find that inter-annotator agreement (IAA) varies by dimension:
fine-grained annotation improves agreement on correctness, coarse improves
agreement on relevance, and judgments on safety remain inconsistent.
Additionally, annotating only a small subset of sentences can provide
reliability comparable to coarse annotations, reducing cost and effort.

*Jingyi Chen,Zhimeng Guo,Jiyun Chun,Pichao Wang,Andrew Perrault,Micha Elsner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LISTEN基准测试显示当前大型音频语言模型在情感理解中过度依赖词汇线索而非声学信息，表现出词汇主导而非真正的声音理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型音频语言模型是否真正处理声学信息还是主要依赖词汇内容来理解情感，需要设计能区分词汇依赖和声学敏感性的评估方法。

Method: 开发LISTEN基准测试，通过控制词汇和声学线索的对比设置（对齐、冲突、副语言场景）来评估6个最先进的大型音频语言模型。

Result: 模型表现出一致的词汇主导：词汇线索中性时预测"中性"，线索对齐时改进有限，线索冲突时无法区分不同情感，副语言场景下表现接近随机猜测。

Conclusion: 当前大型音频语言模型主要是"转录"而非"倾听"，严重依赖词汇语义而未能充分利用声学线索。LISTEN为评估多模态模型的情感理解提供了原则性框架。

Abstract: Understanding emotion from speech requires sensitivity to both lexical and
acoustic cues. However, it remains unclear whether large audio language models
(LALMs) genuinely process acoustic information or rely primarily on lexical
content. We present LISTEN (Lexical vs. Acoustic Speech Test for Emotion in
Narratives), a controlled benchmark designed to disentangle lexical reliance
from acoustic sensitivity in emotion understanding. Across evaluations of six
state-of-the-art LALMs, we observe a consistent lexical dominance. Models
predict "neutral" when lexical cues are neutral or absent, show limited gains
under cue alignment, and fail to classify distinct emotions under cue conflict.
In paralinguistic settings, performance approaches chance. These results
indicate that current LALMs largely "transcribe" rather than "listen," relying
heavily on lexical semantics while underutilizing acoustic cues. LISTEN offers
a principled framework for assessing emotion understanding in multimodal
models.

TL;DR: RECON框架通过集成显式摘要模块压缩检索证据，减少35%上下文长度，提升RAG系统训练速度和推理延迟，同时在下游QA基准上提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于强化学习的检索增强生成系统存在上下文管理效率低下的问题，冗长嘈杂的检索文档会增加成本并降低性能。

Method: RECON框架在推理循环中集成显式摘要模块，通过两阶段训练：在QA数据集上进行相关性预训练，然后从专有LLMs进行多方面蒸馏以确保事实性和清晰度。

Result: 在Search-R1管道中，RECON将总上下文长度减少35%，3B模型的平均EM分数提升14.5%，7B模型提升3.0%，在多跳QA任务中表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: RECON证明了学习上下文压缩对于构建实用、可扩展和高性能的RAG系统至关重要。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems trained using reinforcement
learning (RL) with reasoning are hampered by inefficient context management,
where long, noisy retrieved documents increase costs and degrade performance.
We introduce RECON (REasoning with CONdensation), a framework that integrates
an explicit summarization module to compress evidence within the reasoning
loop. Our summarizer is trained via a two-stage process: relevance pretraining
on QA datasets, followed by multi-aspect distillation from proprietary LLMs to
ensure factuality and clarity. Integrated into the Search-R1 pipeline, RECON
reduces total context length by 35\%, leading to improved training speed and
inference latency, while simultaneously improving RAG performance on downstream
QA benchmarks. Notably, it boosts the average EM score of the 3B model by
14.5\% and the 7B model by 3.0\%, showing particular strength in multi-hop QA.
RECON demonstrates that learned context compression is essential for building
practical, scalable, and performant RAG systems. Our code implementation is
made available at https://github.com/allfornancy/RECON.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文分析了大型语言模型在安全对齐中产生的过度拒绝问题，特别是在检索增强生成(RAG)场景中，构建了RagRefuse基准来研究查询意图和检索上下文对拒绝行为的影响，并提出了SafeRAG-Steering方法来缓解过度拒绝问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的安全对齐会导致过度拒绝问题，即模型会拒绝良性请求。在RAG场景中，查询意图和检索上下文的特性都会影响拒绝行为，但目前缺乏对此现象的系统性分析。

Method: 构建了RagRefuse基准，涵盖医学、化学和开放领域，包含良性和有害查询，并控制上下文污染模式和大小。提出了SafeRAG-Steering方法，这是一种模型中心的嵌入干预技术，在推理时将嵌入区域引导到确认安全、非拒绝的输出区域。

Result: 分析表明上下文排列/污染、查询和上下文领域以及有害文本密度都会触发对良性查询的拒绝，其效果取决于模型特定的对齐选择。SafeRAG-Steering方法能够减少受污染RAG管道中的过度拒绝，同时保留合法的拒绝。

Conclusion: RAG中的过度拒绝问题受到多种因素影响，通过嵌入干预技术可以有效缓解这一问题，在保持安全性的同时减少不必要的拒绝行为。

Abstract: Safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) induces over-refusals --
where LLMs decline benign requests due to aggressive safety filters. We analyze
this phenomenon in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where both the query
intent and retrieved context properties influence refusal behavior. We
construct RagRefuse, a domain-stratified benchmark spanning medical, chemical,
and open domains, pairing benign and harmful queries with controlled context
contamination patterns and sizes. Our analysis shows that context arrangement /
contamination, domain of query and context, and harmful-text density trigger
refusals even on benign queries, with effects depending on model-specific
alignment choices. To mitigate over-refusals, we introduce
\textsc{SafeRAG-Steering}, a model-centric embedding intervention that steers
the embedding regions towards the confirmed safe, non-refusing output regions
at inference time. This reduces over-refusals in contaminated RAG pipelines
while preserving legitimate refusals.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种新的对齐方法（时间独立性损失和对齐交叉熵损失）来解决语音和文本长度不匹配的问题，通过帧融合增强关键帧信息，在AISHELL数据集上显著减少了帧数并提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语音识别中语音长度与文本长度不匹配的问题，特别是在两者长度相近的情况下，传统CTC方法在将语音下采样到与文本相似长度时无法正确对齐。

Method: 提出了两种对齐方法：时间独立性损失（TIL）和对齐交叉熵损失（AXE），以及通过加权和融合关键帧及其上下文2帧的帧融合技术来增强关键帧信息。

Result: 在AISHELL-1和AISHELL-2数据集子集上的实验结果表明，所提方法优于先前工作，帧数减少了至少86%。

Conclusion: 所提出的时间独立性损失和对齐交叉熵损失方法有效解决了语音与文本对齐问题，显著减少了所需帧数并提升了语音识别性能。

Abstract: The mismatch of speech length and text length poses a challenge in automatic
speech recognition (ASR). In previous research, various approaches have been
employed to align text with speech, including the utilization of Connectionist
Temporal Classification (CTC). In earlier work, a key frame mechanism (KFDS)
was introduced, utilizing intermediate CTC outputs to guide downsampling and
preserve keyframes, but traditional methods (CTC) failed to align speech and
text appropriately when downsampling speech to a text-similar length. In this
paper, we focus on speech recognition in those cases where the length of speech
aligns closely with that of the corresponding text. To address this issue, we
introduce two methods for alignment: a) Time Independence Loss (TIL) and b)
Aligned Cross Entropy (AXE) Loss, which is based on edit distance. To enhance
the information on keyframes, we incorporate frame fusion by applying weights
and summing the keyframe with its context 2 frames. Experimental results on
AISHELL-1 and AISHELL-2 dataset subsets show that the proposed methods
outperform the previous work and achieve a reduction of at least 86\% in the
number of frames.

Motivation: 现有基准套件规模庞大但缺乏系统化框架来整合冗余减少和性能预测方法，需要确保预测准确性和排名一致性

Method: 首先进行样本级冗余分析，将基准压缩构建为分数重构优化问题，提出基于迭代遗传算法的粗到细框架，结合基于适应度的子集搜索和基于归因的样本搜索

Result: 在HellaSwag基准上，使用25倍更少样本保持所有模型排名在5%内变化，仅用200倍更少样本实现95%排名在5%内保持

Conclusion: EssenceBench方法在压缩效率、重构误差和排名保持方面优于先前方法，为大规模基准评估提供有效解决方案

Abstract: As the demand for comprehensive evaluations of diverse model capabilities
steadily increases, benchmark suites have correspondingly grown significantly
in scale. Despite notable advances in redundancy reduction and subset-level
performance prediction, a systematic framework that effectively integrates
these methods to ensure both prediction accuracy and ranking consistency is
still largely elusive. In this paper, we first perform a sample-level analysis
of benchmark redundancy and identify several highly similar samples that can be
eliminated. Besides, we frame benchmark compression as an optimization problem
with the aim of score reconstruction. Building on these, we then propose
EssenceBench, a coarse-to-fine framework utilizing an iterative Genetic
Algorithm (GA), which takes the advantages of fitness-based subset search and
attribution-based sample search. Compared to previous methods, our approach
yields superior compression results with lower reconstruction error and
markedly higher efficiency. In particular, on the HellaSwag benchmark (10K
samples), our method preserves the ranking of all models shifting within 5%
using 25x fewer samples, and achieves 95% ranking preservation shifting within
5% using only 200x fewer samples.

Abstract: Digital communication has become the cornerstone of modern interaction,
enabling rapid, accessible, and interactive exchanges. However, individuals
with lower academic literacy often face significant barriers, exacerbating the
"digital divide". In this work, we introduce a novel, universal ideographic
metalanguage designed as an innovative communication framework that transcends
academic, linguistic, and cultural boundaries. Our approach leverages
principles of Neuro-symbolic AI, combining neural-based large language models
(LLMs) enriched with world knowledge and symbolic knowledge heuristics grounded
in the linguistic theory of Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM). This enables
the semantic decomposition of complex ideas into simpler, atomic concepts.
Adopting a human-centric, collaborative methodology, we engaged over 200
semi-literate participants in defining the problem, selecting ideographs, and
validating the system. With over 80\% semantic comprehensibility, an accessible
learning curve, and universal adaptability, our system effectively serves
underprivileged populations with limited formal education.

Motivation: 现有评估自动机器学习研究代理的基准测试过度强调工程方面而忽视学术严谨性，任务多样性有限，过度关注应用导向任务而非基础研究问题，且难以扩展到真实研究环境。

Method: 开发了FML-bench基准测试，包含8个不同的基础机器学习研究问题，减少编码负担，强调基础问题而非特定用例，提供高任务多样性，并可扩展到真实世界的机器学习GitHub仓库。同时提出了包含5个互补指标的统一评估框架。

Result: 在FML-bench上评估了最先进的自动研究代理，发现采用广泛研究探索策略的代理优于专注于狭窄但深入探索的代理。

Conclusion: 强调探索的广度可能比仅关注增量改进带来更有效的研究成果。FML-bench基准测试为评估自动机器学习研究代理提供了更全面的框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in automatic
machine learning research agents. Among them, agents capable of autonomously
proposing ideas and conducting machine learning experiments are particularly
promising, as they maximize research automation and accelerate scientific
progress by iteratively refining ideas based on experimental results. However,
comprehensively evaluating such agents remains challenging. Existing benchmarks
tend to overemphasize engineering aspects while neglecting academic rigor,
creating barriers that obscure a clear assessment of an agent's scientific
capabilities in machine learning research. They also suffer from limited task
diversity, an overemphasis on application-oriented tasks over fundamental
research problems, and limited scalability to realistic research settings. To
address these limitations, we introduce FML-bench, a benchmark designed to
evaluate automatic machine learning research agents on 8 diverse and
fundamental machine learning research problems. It reduces coding burden,
emphasizes fundamental problems rather than specific use cases, offers high
task diversity, and is extensible to real-world machine learning GitHub
repositories. Furthermore, we present a unified evaluation framework with five
complementary metrics, designed to comprehensively assess agent performance on
our benchmark. We evaluate state-of-the-art automatic research agents on
FML-bench, and find that agents employing broad research exploration strategies
outperform those focusing on narrow but deep exploration. These findings
suggest that emphasizing the breadth of exploration may lead to more effective
research outcomes than focusing solely on incremental refinement. Our benchmark

TL;DR: 本研究通过LDA主题建模分析TED演讲，发现创作者供给与观众需求之间存在持续不匹配，且时间动态对观众参与度的影响比主题内容更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数字服务经济中，理解什么驱动流行度至关重要。先前研究主要强调内容特征的作用，但创作者经常误判观众真正看重的内容。

Method: 应用潜在狄利克雷分配(LDA)模型分析大量TED演讲语料，将平台视为数字服务提供案例，比较创作者的主题供给与观众参与表达的需求。

Result: 识别出创作者供给与消费者偏好之间的持续不匹配，纵向分析显示时间动态对消费者参与度的影响比主题内容更强。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了内容特征是流行度主要驱动因素的假设，强调了时机和情境因素在塑造消费者响应中的重要性，为数字平台上的消费者注意力动态提供了新见解。

Abstract: Understanding what drives popularity is critical in today's digital service
economy, where content creators compete for consumer attention. Prior studies
have primarily emphasized the role of content features, yet creators often
misjudge what audiences actually value. This study applies Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA) modeling to a large corpus of TED Talks, treating the platform
as a case of digital service provision in which creators (speakers) and
consumers (audiences) interact. By comparing the thematic supply of creators
with the demand expressed in audience engagement, we identify persistent
mismatches between producer offerings and consumer preferences. Our
longitudinal analysis further reveals that temporal dynamics exert a stronger
influence on consumer engagement than thematic content, suggesting that when
content is delivered may matter more than what is delivered. These findings
challenge the dominant assumption that content features are the primary drivers
of popularity and highlight the importance of timing and contextual factors in
shaping consumer responses. The results provide new insights into consumer
attention dynamics on digital platforms and carry practical implications for
marketers, platform managers, and content creators seeking to optimize audience
engagement strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗订单提取对结构化临床信息、支持决策制定和下游应用至关重要，但订单可能嵌入在电子健康记录、出院总结和医患对话等多种来源中。

Method: 使用通用指令调优的LLaMA-4 17B模型，不进行领域特定微调，仅通过单个上下文示例进行指导的少样本配置。

Result: 平均F1得分为37.76，在17个参与团队的105份提交中排名第5，在原因和来源准确性方面有显著改进。

Conclusion: 结果表明，大型非领域特定LLM与有效的提示工程相结合，可以为专门的临床NLP任务提供强大且可扩展的基线。

Abstract: Medical order extraction is essential for structuring actionable clinical
information, supporting decision-making, and enabling downstream applications
such as documentation and workflow automation. Orders may be embedded in
diverse sources, including electronic health records, discharge summaries, and
multi-turn doctor-patient dialogues, and can span categories such as
medications, laboratory tests, imaging studies, and follow-up actions. The
MEDIQA-OE 2025 shared task focuses on extracting structured medical orders from
extended conversational transcripts, requiring the identification of order
type, description, reason, and provenance. We present the MasonNLP submission,
which ranked 5th among 17 participating teams with 105 total submissions. Our
approach uses a general-purpose, instruction-tuned LLaMA-4 17B model without
domain-specific fine-tuning, guided by a single in-context example. This
few-shot configuration achieved an average F1 score of 37.76, with notable
improvements in reason and provenance accuracy. These results demonstrate that
large, non-domain-specific LLMs, when paired with effective prompt engineering,
can serve as strong, scalable baselines for specialized clinical NLP tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散LLMs在长上下文行为方面的研究尚不充分，需要探索有效的上下文扩展方法。

Method: 对标准RoPE位置编码进行简单修改以适应扩散过程的概率建模，并比较不同的掩码策略对优化稳定性和长程回忆的影响。

Result: 提出的UltraLLaDA模型在长上下文任务中显著优于无需训练的基线方法。

Conclusion: 特殊的位置扩展技术是扩展扩散LLMs上下文的关键杠杆，为通过高效后训练实现128K规模上下文提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Diffusion LLMs have attracted growing interest, with plenty of recent work
emphasizing their great potential in various downstream tasks; yet the
long-context behavior of diffusion LLMs remains largely uncharted. We present a
case study of post-training techniques for extending the context window of
diffusion LLMs (i.e., LLaDA) without retraining from scratch. We show that a
simple modification to the standard Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE)
extension effectively accommodates the probabilistic modeling inherent in the
diffusion process, enabling stable scaling to longer context ranges. We further
compare masking strategies used during post-training and analyze their impact
on optimization stability and long-range recall. Instantiating these insights,
we introduce UltraLLaDA, a diffusion LLM with a 128K-token context window that,
in our empirical evaluation on long-context tasks, significantly outperforms
training-free baselines. Our experimental results highlight the special
positional extension as a key lever for scaling diffusion LLMs to extended
contexts and offer practical guidance for practitioners seeking 128K-scale
context via efficient post-training.

*Prawaal Sharma,Poonam Goyal,Vidisha Sharma,Navneet Goyal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为VOLTAGE的无监督OCR方法，用于保护濒危语言，特别针对低资源语言如Takri文字，通过对比学习和自动字形特征推荐实现字符识别，在机器打印和手写样本上分别达到95%和87%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球7000种语言中有2500种濒危，语言消失会导致传统智慧、民间文学和社区本质的丧失。低资源语言由于缺乏无监督OCR方法而面临更大的灭绝风险，需要实现数字包容。

Method: 使用对比学习基础的OCR方法VOLTAGE，结合自动字形特征推荐进行聚类标注，通过图像变换和生成对抗网络增强标注数据的多样性和数量。

Result: 在Takri文字上，机器打印样本准确率达到95%，手写样本达到87%。该方法在其他印度文字（包括低资源和高资源）上也表现出通用性。

Conclusion: VOLTAGE方法有效解决了低资源语言的无监督OCR问题，为濒危语言的数字保存提供了可行方案，并通过下游应用案例证明了其实用性。

Abstract: UNESCO has classified 2500 out of 7000 languages spoken worldwide as
endangered. Attrition of a language leads to loss of traditional wisdom, folk
literature, and the essence of the community that uses it. It is therefore
imperative to bring digital inclusion to these languages and avoid its
extinction. Low resource languages are at a greater risk of extinction. Lack of
unsupervised Optical Character Recognition(OCR) methodologies for low resource
languages is one of the reasons impeding their digital inclusion. We propose
VOLTAGE - a contrastive learning based OCR methodology, leveraging auto-glyph
feature recommendation for cluster-based labelling. We augment the labelled
data for diversity and volume using image transformations and Generative
Adversarial Networks. Voltage has been designed using Takri - a family of
scripts used in 16th to 20th century in the Himalayan regions of India. We
present results for Takri along with other Indic scripts (both low and high
resource) to substantiate the universal behavior of the methodology. An
accuracy of 95% for machine printed and 87% for handwritten samples on Takri
script has been achieved. We conduct baseline and ablation studies along with
building downstream use cases for Takri, demonstrating the usefulness of our
work.

TL;DR: AdvPrompt通过黑盒对抗提示减少大型推理模型的过度思考，在保持准确性的同时显著降低token使用量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂推理任务中表现出色，但冗长的推理过程带来了巨大的计算和延迟开销，阻碍了实际部署

Method: 提出AdvPrompt迭代优化框架，从多角度生成高质量对抗提示，将开源和闭源模型都视为黑盒通信器

Result: 在多个基准测试中，AdvPrompt平均减少40%的token使用量，Qwen3模型在GSM8K上响应长度减少3倍，Claude-3.7和Gemini-2.5在MATH-500上分别减少35%和47%的token使用

Conclusion: 黑盒提示是一种实用有效的策略，可显著提升大型推理模型的效率，且AdvPrompt在不同模型规模和家族中具有良好的泛化性

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
tackling complex reasoning tasks through step-by-step thinking. However, such a
lengthy reasoning process incurs substantial computational and latency
overheads, hindering the practical deployment of these models. In this work, we
present a new perspective on mitigating overthinking in LRMs via black-box
adversarial prompting. By treating both open-source LRMs and closed-source APIs
as black-box communicators, we investigate how to elicit concise responses
without sacrificing accuracy. We introduce AdvPrompt, an iterative refinement
framework that generates high-quality adversarial prompts from diverse
perspectives. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that AdvPrompt
consistently reduces token usage while preserving performance. Notably,
AdvPrompt achieves a 3x reduction in average response length on simple GSM8K
questions for the Qwen3 model series, and delivers an average ~40% token
reduction across four benchmarks. For closed-source APIs, AdvPrompt reduces
token usage on MATH-500 by 35% for Claude-3.7 and 47% for Gemini-2.5. Further
analysis reveals the generalizability of AdvPrompt across various model scales
and families, underscoring the potential of black-box prompting as a practical
and effective strategy for enhancing LRM efficiency.

TL;DR: AuthenHallu是首个完全基于真实LLM-人类对话构建的幻觉检测基准，相比人工构造的基准更能反映实际使用中的幻觉特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测基准多为人工构造，无法真实反映LLM在实际使用中的幻觉特征，需要基于真实LLM-人类对话构建更可靠的基准。

Method: 从真实的LLM-人类对话中筛选和标注样本，构建AuthenHallu基准，并分析幻觉在不同领域的分布情况。

Result: 在基准中31.4%的查询-响应对存在幻觉，在数学和数字问题等挑战性领域该比例升至60.0%。使用普通LLM作为幻觉检测器虽有潜力但性能仍不足。

Conclusion: 基于真实对话的基准能更准确反映LLM幻觉特征，当前LLM作为幻觉检测器的能力仍需提升，AuthenHallu为未来研究提供了更可靠的评估基础。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in sensitive domains
such as medicine and law, hallucination detection has become a critical task.
Although numerous benchmarks have been proposed to advance research in this
area, most of them are artificially constructed--either through deliberate
hallucination induction or simulated interactions--rather than derived from
genuine LLM-human dialogues. Consequently, these benchmarks fail to fully
capture the characteristics of hallucinations that occur in real-world usage.
To address this limitation, we introduce AuthenHallu, the first hallucination
detection benchmark built entirely from authentic LLM-human interactions. For
AuthenHallu, we select and annotate samples from genuine LLM-human dialogues,
thereby providing a faithful reflection of how LLMs hallucinate in everyday
user interactions. Statistical analysis shows that hallucinations occur in
31.4% of the query-response pairs in our benchmark, and this proportion
increases dramatically to 60.0% in challenging domains such as Math & Number
Problems. Furthermore, we explore the potential of using vanilla LLMs
themselves as hallucination detectors and find that, despite some promise,
their current performance remains insufficient in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: BitMar是一种量化多模态变换器，使用1.58位编码器和外部情景记忆，在资源受限的硬件上实现高效的图像文本生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决交叉注意力变换器等多模态视觉语言模型在边缘设备部署时面临的内存和计算资源限制问题，同时增强对过去上下文的利用。

Method: 使用1.58位编码器（BitNet风格文本编码器和DiNOv2视觉编码器）创建紧凑嵌入，结合固定大小的键值情景记忆，采用逐层条件化和滑动窗口注意力机制。

Result: 在低延迟和小模型占用空间下实现了竞争力的图像描述和多模态理解性能，达到了良好的质量-速度权衡。

Conclusion: BitMar的特性使其非常适合边缘部署，为资源受限环境下的多模态生成任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-attention transformers and other multimodal vision-language models
excel at grounding and generation; however, their extensive, full-precision
backbones make it challenging to deploy them on edge devices. Memory-augmented
architectures enhance the utilization of past context; however, most works
rarely pair them with aggressive edge-oriented quantization. We introduce
BitMar, a quantized multimodal transformer that proposes an external human-like
episodic memory for effective image-text generation on hardware with limited
resources. BitMar utilizes 1.58-bit encoders, one for text (BitNet-style) and
one for vision (DiNOv2-based), to create compact embeddings that are combined
and used to query a fixed-size key-value episodic memory. During vector
retrieval, the BitNet decoder applies per-layer conditioning, which increases
the contextual relevance of generated content. The decoder also employs
attention sinks with a sliding-window mechanism to process long or streaming
inputs under tight memory budgets. The combination of per-layer conditioning
and sliding-window attention achieves a strong quality-speed trade-off,
delivering competitive captioning and multimodal understanding at low latency
with a small model footprint. These characteristics make BitMar well-suited for
edge deployment.

TL;DR: 提出基于时序大语言模型的动态主题演化建模框架，通过时间衰减函数和注意力机制捕捉主题随时间的变化，在潜在主题空间中使用状态转移矩阵描述主题动态演化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题模型难以有效捕捉主题随时间的动态演化过程，需要一种能够统一建模语义表示和时间演化的系统性解决方案。

Method: 使用大语言模型获取文本上下文嵌入，引入时间衰减函数和注意力机制调整语义单元重要性，在潜在主题空间应用状态转移矩阵描述主题演化，通过联合优化目标约束语义建模和时间一致性。

Result: 在真实语料上的实验表明，该框架能有效捕捉主题的生成、扩展和衰退过程，在多个指标上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为理解大规模文本中的动态语义模式提供了系统性解决方案，丰富了主题建模的研究范式，支持多领域的复杂文本分析任务。

Abstract: This paper proposes a modeling framework for dynamic topic evolution based on
temporal large language models. The method first uses a large language model to
obtain contextual embeddings of text and then introduces a temporal decay
function and an attention mechanism. These components allow the model to adjust
the importance of semantic units according to time intervals and capture topic
variations across different periods. The temporal representations are then
mapped into a latent topic space, where a state transition matrix is applied to
describe the dynamic evolution of topics. A joint optimization objective
constrains both semantic modeling and temporal consistency, ensuring diversity
and smoothness in topic generation. The design emphasizes the unified modeling
of semantic representation and temporal evolution, which improves topic
coherence and diversity while enhancing stability and interpretability over
time. Experiments on real-world corpora show that the framework effectively
captures the generation, expansion, and decline of topics and outperforms
existing models across multiple metrics. Overall, the proposed method provides
a systematic solution for understanding dynamic semantic patterns in
large-scale text, enriches the research paradigm of topic modeling, and
supports complex text analysis tasks in multiple domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对校准数据如何影响压缩后LLM能力的研究不足，特别是对高级复杂推理能力的影响机制缺乏系统分析。

Method: 从激活模式角度分析校准数据的影响机制，探索数学问题解决和代码生成等高阶推理能力，提出基于激活空间代表性和多样性的校准数据筛选框架。

Result: 研究发现校准数据的激活空间代表性和多样性更根本地决定了其质量，提出的框架能有效提升现有后训练压缩方法在保留关键LLM能力方面的性能。

Conclusion: 校准数据的质量不仅取决于数据来源和样本数量，更重要的是其在激活空间的代表性和多样性，这为改进后训练压缩方法提供了新视角。

Abstract: Post-training compression has been a widely employed approach to scale down
large language model (LLM) and facilitate efficient inference. In various
proposed compression methods, including pruning and quantization, calibration
data plays a vital role by informing the weight importance and activation
dynamic ranges. However, how calibration data impacts the LLM capability after
compression is less explored. Few of the existing works, though recognizing the
significance of this study, only investigate the language modeling or
commonsense reasoning performance degradation from limited angles, like the
data sources or sample amounts. More systematic research is still needed to
examine the impacts on different LLM capabilities in terms of compositional
properties and domain correspondence of calibration data. In this work, we aim
at bridging this gap and further analyze underlying influencing mechanisms from
the activation pattern perspective. Especially, we explore the calibration
data's impacts on high-level complex reasoning capabilities, like math problem
solving and code generation. Delving into the underlying mechanism, we find
that the representativeness and diversity in activation space more
fundamentally determine the quality of calibration data. Finally, we propose a
calibration data curation framework based on such observations and analysis,
enhancing the performance of existing post-training compression methods on
preserving critical LLM capabilities. Our code is provided in

TL;DR: 提出Epistemic Appeal Identification新任务，识别事实陈述如何通过外部来源或证据进行锚定。创建FactAppeal数据集，包含3,226个新闻句子的人工标注，涵盖事实陈述和来源提及的细粒度特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注声明检测和验证，但缺乏对事实陈述背后认知结构和证据基础的深入分析。需要理解事实陈述如何通过外部来源获得可信度。

Method: 构建FactAppeal数据集，进行细粒度标注，包括来源类型、命名提及、角色描述、认知凭证、引用方式等特征。使用2B-9B参数的编码器和生成式解码器模型进行建模。

Result: 最佳模型基于Gemma 2 9B，在宏F1分数上达到0.73。

Conclusion: Epistemic Appeal Identification是一个重要且可行的任务，FactAppeal数据集为理解事实陈述的可信度基础提供了有价值的资源。

Abstract: How is a factual claim made credible? We propose the novel task of Epistemic
Appeal Identification, which identifies whether and how factual statements have
been anchored by external sources or evidence. To advance research on this
task, we present FactAppeal, a manually annotated dataset of 3,226
English-language news sentences. Unlike prior resources that focus solely on
claim detection and verification, FactAppeal identifies the nuanced epistemic
structures and evidentiary basis underlying these claims and used to support
them. FactAppeal contains span-level annotations which identify factual
statements and mentions of sources on which they rely. Moreover, the
annotations include fine-grained characteristics of factual appeals such as the
type of source (e.g. Active Participant, Witness, Expert, Direct Evidence),
whether it is mentioned by name, mentions of the source's role and epistemic
credentials, attribution to the source via direct or indirect quotation, and
other features. We model the task with a range of encoder models and generative
decoder models in the 2B-9B parameter range. Our best performing model, based
on Gemma 2 9B, achieves a macro-F1 score of 0.73.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然媒体偏见被广泛研究，但事实报道背后的认知策略在计算层面仍未被充分探索。

Method: 采用文章匹配策略比较同一事件的报道，应用FactAppeal框架分析47万篇涵盖COVID-19疫情和以色列-哈马斯战争的文章。

Result: CNN的报道包含更多事实陈述并更倾向于引用外部来源，两家媒体展现出截然不同的引用模式：CNN通过引用专家和专家文件构建正式权威，福克斯新闻则偏好新闻报道和直接引用。

Conclusion: 这项研究量化了党派媒体如何使用系统性不同的认知策略来构建现实，为媒体偏见研究增添了新维度。

Abstract: While media bias is widely studied, the epistemic strategies behind factual
reporting remain computationally underexplored. This paper analyzes these
strategies through a large-scale comparison of CNN and Fox News. To isolate
reporting style from topic selection, we employ an article matching strategy to
compare reports on the same events and apply the FactAppeal framework to a
corpus of over 470K articles covering two highly politicized periods: the
COVID-19 pandemic and the Israel-Hamas war. We find that CNN's reporting
contains more factual statements and is more likely to ground them in external
sources. The outlets also exhibit sharply divergent sourcing patterns: CNN
builds credibility by citing Experts} and Expert Documents, constructing an
appeal to formal authority, whereas Fox News favors News Reports and direct
quotations. This work quantifies how partisan outlets use systematically
different epistemic strategies to construct reality, adding a new dimension to
the study of media bias.

Motivation: 现有的单体架构在处理复杂推理和多样化数据库模式时存在困难，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 采用多专家代理框架，包括推理代理进行问题分解、编码代理生成子查询、优化步骤进行列选择，并使用自适应路由器在模块化流水线和基线解析器之间选择。

Result: 在Spider基准测试中，使用14B参数的模型达到了86.07%的执行准确率，接近GPT-4的89.65% SOTA性能，同时提高了可解释性。

Conclusion: AGENTIQL提供了一个强大、可扩展且可解释的语义解析方法，通过暴露中间推理步骤增强了透明度，显著缩小了与GPT-4等大型模型的性能差距。

Abstract: LLMs have advanced text-to-SQL generation, yet monolithic architectures
struggle with complex reasoning and schema diversity. We propose AGENTIQL, an
agent-inspired multi-expert framework that combines a reasoning agent for
question decomposition, a coding agent for sub-query generation, and a
refinement step for column selection. An adaptive router further balances
efficiency and accuracy by selecting between our modular pipeline and a
baseline parser. Several steps in the pipeline can be executed in parallel,
making the framework scalable to larger workloads. Evaluated on the Spider
benchmark, AGENTIQL improves execution accuracy and interpretability and
achieves up to 86.07\% EX with 14B models using the Planner&Executor merging
strategy. The attained performance is contingent upon the efficacy of the
routing mechanism, thereby narrowing the gap to GPT-4-based SOTA (89.65% EX)
while using much smaller open-source LLMs. Beyond accuracy, AGENTIQL enhances
transparency by exposing intermediate reasoning steps, offering a robust,
scalable, and interpretable approach to semantic parsing.

TL;DR: BrowserAgent是一个基于人类浏览行为的交互式网络代理，通过直接操作浏览器页面而非依赖工具转换静态文本，在开放式问答任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Search-R1和WebDancer依赖额外工具将交互式网络环境转换为静态文本内容，这与人类多样化的浏览器交互行为（滚动、点击、输入）不符。

Method: 采用两阶段训练（监督微调和拒绝微调），通过预定义的浏览器操作直接操作原始网页，并引入显式记忆机制存储关键结论。

Result: 尽管使用比Search-R1少得多的训练数据，BrowserAgent在不同开放式问答任务中取得更具竞争力的结果，在HotpotQA、2Wiki和Bamboogle等多跳问答任务上比Search-R1提升约20%。

Conclusion: BrowserAgent可以作为更先进、交互性和可扩展性更强的网络代理框架。

Abstract: Efficiently solving real-world problems with LLMs increasingly hinges on
their ability to interact with dynamic web environments and autonomously
acquire external information. While recent research like Search-R1 and
WebDancer demonstrates strong performance in solving web tasks, they heavily
rely on additional tools to convert the interactive web environment into static
text content. This is in contrast to human browsing behaviors, which involve
diverse interactions with the browser, such as scrolling, clicking, and typing.
In this paper, we propose BrowserAgent, a more interactive agent that solves
complex tasks through human-inspired browser actions. BrowserAgent operates
directly on raw web pages via Playwright through a set of predefined browser
actions. We adopt a two-stage training (Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT)) to improve the model's generalization abilities.
Despite using significantly less training data than Search-R1, BrowserAgent
achieves more competitive results across different Open-QA tasks. Additionally,
we introduce an explicit memory mechanism to store key conclusions across
steps, further enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities for long-horizon
tasks. Notably, BrowserAgent-7B can achieve around 20\% improvement over
Search-R1 on multi-hop QA tasks like HotpotQA, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle. These
results indicate that BrowserAgent can serve as a more advanced framework for
more interactive and scalable web agents.

Method: 基于推理的多语言安全防护方法，通过推理增强可解释性，通过对齐促进语言间知识迁移。

Result: 仅使用1,000个训练样本，在三个数据集和六种语言上表现出优越性能，超越了使用更多数据训练的大模型，并展现出强大的可解释性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: ConsistentGuard方法有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提供了多语言基准扩展并开源代码以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have enhanced AI capabilities, but also increased the
risk posed by malicious requests, highlighting the need for effective LLM
safeguards to detect such queries. Existing approaches largely rely on
classifier-based methods that lack interpretability and perform poorly on
low-resource languages. To address these limitations, we propose
ConsistentGuard, a novel reasoning-based multilingual safeguard, which enhances
explainability via reasoning and boosts knowledge transfer between languages
through alignment. With only 1,000 training samples, our method demonstrates
superior performance on three datasets across six languages, outperforming
larger models trained with significantly more data, and exhibits strong
interpretability and generalization ability. We also contribute a multilingual
benchmark extension and release our codes to support future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量预训练数据是大型语言模型的"化石燃料"，但前沿模型的可用数据储备正在枯竭，需要更有效的数据利用方法。

Method: 训练一个40亿参数的语言模型作为重述器，设计一个质量奖励和三个忠实度奖励，通过强化学习优化模型生成既高质量又保持原始数据核心语义和结构的重述。

Result: 在400M和1.4B模型上的预训练结果显示，RePro在22个下游任务上比纯有机数据基线获得4.7%-14.0%的相对准确率提升，数据效率提高2-3倍，优于基于提示的70B重述器方法。

Conclusion: RePro为有效利用LLM预训练的"化石燃料"提供了一条高效且可控的路径，能够显著提升数据利用效率。

Abstract: High-quality pretraining data is the fossil fuel of large language models
(LLMs), yet its reserves are running low for frontier models. In this paper, we
introduce RePro, a novel web recycling method that trains a relatively small LM
with reinforcement learning to generate effective and faithful rephrasings of
pretraining data. Specifically, we design one quality reward and three
faithfulness rewards, optimizing the LM rephraser to convert organic data into
high-quality rephrasings while maintaining its core semantics and structure. In
our experiment, we train a 4B rephraser to recycle 72B tokens sampled from
DCLM-RefinedWeb. Pretraining results on 400M and 1.4B models demonstrate that
RePro delivers 4.7%-14.0% relative accuracy gains over organic-only baseline on
22 downstream tasks. RePro also outperforms ReWire, the state-of-the-art web
recycling method that prompts a 70B rephraser, as well as the organic baseline
with a 4x larger data pool. Experiments with different amounts of recycled data
highlight that RePro improves organic data efficiency by 2-3x. Individual and
distributional analyses validate that RePro preserves more critical information
and faithfully reflects the characteristics of organic data compared to
prompting-based methods. Together, these results show that RePro provides an
efficient and controllable path to effectively harness the fossil fuel of LLM
pretraining. We open-source our code, rephraser, and recycled data at

TL;DR: LLMs在方法学评估中表现接近人类专家，但在复杂推理任务上仍有15%的差距，需要人类监督来确保准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统评价需要大量人工劳动，特别是提取详细方法学信息。LLMs有潜力自动化方法学评估，改变证据合成方式。

Method: 以因果中介分析为代表方法学领域，在180篇全文科学文章中，将最先进LLMs与专家人类评审员进行对比。

Result: 模型性能与人类判断高度相关（准确率相关性0.71；F1相关性0.97），在明确陈述的方法学标准上达到接近人类的准确率，但在复杂推理评估上准确率显著下降，落后专家评审员达15%。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs擅长识别明确的方法学特征，但在细致解释上需要人类监督。自动化信息提取与针对性专家评审相结合，有望提高证据合成的效率和严谨性。

Abstract: Systematic reviews are crucial for synthesizing scientific evidence but
remain labor-intensive, especially when extracting detailed methodological
information. Large language models (LLMs) offer potential for automating
methodological assessments, promising to transform evidence synthesis. Here,
using causal mediation analysis as a representative methodological domain, we
benchmarked state-of-the-art LLMs against expert human reviewers across 180
full-text scientific articles. Model performance closely correlated with human
judgments (accuracy correlation 0.71; F1 correlation 0.97), achieving
near-human accuracy on straightforward, explicitly stated methodological
criteria. However, accuracy sharply declined on complex, inference-intensive
assessments, lagging expert reviewers by up to 15%. Errors commonly resulted
from superficial linguistic cues -- for instance, models frequently
misinterpreted keywords like "longitudinal" or "sensitivity" as automatic
evidence of rigorous methodological approache, leading to systematic
misclassifications. Longer documents yielded lower model accuracy, whereas
publication year showed no significant effect. Our findings highlight an
important pattern for practitioners using LLMs for methods review and synthesis
from full texts: current LLMs excel at identifying explicit methodological
features but require human oversight for nuanced interpretations. Integrating
automated information extraction with targeted expert review thus provides a
promising approach to enhance efficiency and methodological rigor in evidence
synthesis across diverse scientific fields.

*James Ald Teves,Ray Daniel Cal,Josh Magdiel Villaluz,Jean Malolos,Mico Magtira,Ramon Rodriguez,Mideth Abisado,Joseph Marvin Imperial*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了HiligayNER，这是首个用于Hiligaynon语言命名实体识别的公开基准模型，基于超过8000个标注句子构建，使用mBERT和XLM-RoBERTa模型微调，在精度、召回率和F1分数上均超过80%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hiligaynon语言在语言处理研究中代表性不足，缺乏标注语料库和基准模型，本研究旨在为这种低资源菲律宾语言开发语言技术。

Method: 从公开新闻文章、社交媒体帖子和文学文本收集8000多个标注句子，使用mBERT和XLM-RoBERTa两种Transformer模型进行微调。

Result: 两个模型在所有实体类型上的精度、召回率和F1分数均超过80%，与宿务语和他加禄语的跨语言评估显示出良好的可迁移性。

Conclusion: HiligayNER为低资源菲律宾语言的多语言NLP提供了有前景的基础，支持未来区域语言处理研究。

Abstract: The language of Hiligaynon, spoken predominantly by the people of Panay
Island, Negros Occidental, and Soccsksargen in the Philippines, remains
underrepresented in language processing research due to the absence of
annotated corpora and baseline models. This study introduces HiligayNER, the
first publicly available baseline model for the task of Named Entity
Recognition (NER) in Hiligaynon. The dataset used to build HiligayNER contains
over 8,000 annotated sentences collected from publicly available news articles,
social media posts, and literary texts. Two Transformer-based models, mBERT and
XLM-RoBERTa, were fine-tuned on this collected corpus to build versions of
HiligayNER. Evaluation results show strong performance, with both models
achieving over 80% in precision, recall, and F1-score across entity types.
Furthermore, cross-lingual evaluation with Cebuano and Tagalog demonstrates
promising transferability, suggesting the broader applicability of HiligayNER
for multilingual NLP in low-resource settings. This work aims to contribute to
language technology development for underrepresented Philippine languages,
specifically for Hiligaynon, and support future research in regional language
processing.

### [308] [Review of Inference-Time Scaling Strategies: Reasoning, Search and RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10787)
*Zhichao Wang,Cheng Wan,Dong Nie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文综述了推理时扩展技术，将这一新兴领域系统性地分为输出导向和输入导向两大类方法，旨在通过部署时的额外计算而非重新训练来提升LLM性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于高质量训练数据的快速减少已成为根本性瓶颈，研究重点正从模型规模扩展转向推理时扩展，利用部署时的额外计算来显著提升LLM在下游任务中的表现。

Method: 将推理时扩展技术系统性地组织为两个视角：输出导向方法包括复杂多步生成策略（如推理、搜索解码、长CoT训练、模型集成等）；输入导向方法主要包括少样本学习和RAG，其中RAG部分详细分析了查询扩展、数据、检索与重排、LLM生成方法以及多模态RAG。

Result: 该综述为快速演变的推理时扩展领域提供了全面的分类框架，系统梳理了各种技术方法及其相互关系。

Conclusion: 推理时扩展代表了LLM发展的新范式，通过部署时计算而非重新训练来突破数据瓶颈，输出导向和输入导向两大视角为该领域提供了清晰的研究路线图。

Abstract: The performance gains of LLMs have historically been driven by scaling up
model size and training data. However, the rapidly diminishing availability of
high-quality training data is introducing a fundamental bottleneck, shifting
the focus of research toward inference-time scaling. This paradigm uses
additional computation at the time of deployment to substantially improve LLM
performance on downstream tasks without costly model re-training. This review
systematically surveys the diverse techniques contributing to this new era of
inference-time scaling, organizing the rapidly evolving field into two
comprehensive perspectives: Output-focused and Input-focused methods.
Output-focused techniques encompass complex, multi-step generation strategies,
including reasoning (e.g., CoT, ToT, ReAct), various search and decoding
methods (e.g., MCTS, beam search), training for long CoT (e.g., RLVR, GRPO),
and model ensemble methods. Input-focused techniques are primarily categorized
by few-shot and RAG, with RAG as the central focus. The RAG section is further
detailed through a structured examination of query expansion, data, retrieval
and reranker, LLM generation methods, and multi-modal RAG.

### [309] [Toward Human-Centered Readability Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10801)
*Bahar İlgen,Georges Hattab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出HCRS框架，超越传统NLP评估指标，整合自动测量和结构化人类反馈，关注健康文本简化中的人类中心可读性维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NLP评估指标（如BLEU、FKGL、SARI）主要捕捉表面特征，无法衡量健康文本简化中的人类中心质量，如清晰度、可信度、文化相关性等，这在高风险健康环境中尤为关键。

Method: 提出人类中心可读性评分（HCRS），这是一个基于人机交互和健康传播研究的五维评估框架，整合自动测量与结构化人类反馈。

Result: 概述了HCRS框架，讨论了其在参与式评估工作流程中的整合，并提出了实证验证协议。

Conclusion: 这项工作旨在推进健康文本简化评估超越表面指标，使NLP系统更符合多样化用户的需求、期望和生活经验。

Abstract: Text simplification is essential for making public health information
accessible to diverse populations, including those with limited health
literacy. However, commonly used evaluation metrics in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), such as BLEU, FKGL, and SARI, mainly capture surface-level
features and fail to account for human-centered qualities like clarity,
trustworthiness, tone, cultural relevance, and actionability. This limitation
is particularly critical in high-stakes health contexts, where communication
must be not only simple but also usable, respectful, and trustworthy. To
address this gap, we propose the Human-Centered Readability Score (HCRS), a
five-dimensional evaluation framework grounded in Human-Computer Interaction
(HCI) and health communication research. HCRS integrates automatic measures
with structured human feedback to capture the relational and contextual aspects
of readability. We outline the framework, discuss its integration into
participatory evaluation workflows, and present a protocol for empirical
validation. This work aims to advance the evaluation of health text
simplification beyond surface metrics, enabling NLP systems that align more
closely with diverse users' needs, expectations, and lived experiences.

*Mihir Gupte,Paolo Giusto,Ramesh S*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种自下而上的方法，将树状结构（如GitHub仓库）中的知识线性化，通过在每个层级生成隐式聚合摘要，使知识能够存储在知识库中并与RAG直接使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何最佳地表示检索到的知识，以便在结构化数据（特别是树状层次结构）上生成响应，因为现有方法在这方面研究不足。

Method: 采用自下而上的方法，从树状结构中线性化知识，在每个层次级别生成隐式聚合摘要，然后将这些知识存储在知识库中用于RAG。

Result: 与在原始非结构化代码上使用RAG相比，响应质量相当，但检索器中的文档数量减少了68%以上，效率显著提升。

Conclusion: 利用隐式线性化知识可能是处理复杂层次数据结构的高效且可扩展策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are adept at generating responses based on
information within their context. While this ability is useful for interacting
with structured data like code files, another popular method,
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), retrieves relevant documents to augment
the model's in-context learning. However, it is not well-explored how to best
represent this retrieved knowledge for generating responses on structured data,
particularly hierarchical structures like trees. In this work, we propose a
novel bottom-up method to linearize knowledge from tree-like structures (like a
GitHub repository) by generating implicit, aggregated summaries at each
hierarchical level. This approach enables the knowledge to be stored in a
knowledge base and used directly with RAG. We then compare our method to using
RAG on raw, unstructured code, evaluating the accuracy and quality of the
generated responses. Our results show that while response quality is comparable
across both methods, our approach generates over 68% fewer documents in the
retriever, a significant gain in efficiency. This finding suggests that
leveraging implicit, linearized knowledge may be a highly effective and
scalable strategy for handling complex, hierarchical data structures.

*Haeji Jung,Jinju Kim,Kyungjin Kim,Youjeong Roh,David R. Mortensen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了不同音译方法对多语言模型性能的影响，发现罗马化在大多数评估设置中显著优于其他输入类型，主要原因是能共享更长的子词标记。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同音译方法（共享脚本、重叠词汇、共享音系）对多语言模型性能的贡献程度，以弥合不同语言间的差距。

Method: 使用三种音译方法（罗马化、音位转录、替代密码）和正字法进行对照实验，在命名实体识别和自然语言推理两个下游任务上评估模型性能。

Result: 罗马化在8个评估设置中的7个显著优于其他输入类型，与假设一致，表明这是最有效的方法。

Conclusion: 与预训练语言共享更长的子词标记能更好地利用模型，罗马化是最有效的音译方法。

Abstract: Transliteration has emerged as a promising means to bridge the gap between
various languages in multilingual NLP, showing promising results especially for
languages using non-Latin scripts. We investigate the degree to which shared
script, overlapping token vocabularies, and shared phonology contribute to
performance of multilingual models. To this end, we conduct controlled
experiments using three kinds of transliteration (romanization, phonemic
transcription, and substitution ciphers) as well as orthography. We evaluate
each model on two downstream tasks -- named entity recognition (NER) and
natural language inference (NLI) -- and find that romanization significantly
outperforms other input types in 7 out of 8 evaluation settings, largely
consistent with our hypothesis that it is the most effective approach. We
further analyze how each factor contributed to the success, and suggest that
having longer (subword) tokens shared with pre-trained languages leads to
better utilization of the model.

### [312] [DUAL-Bench: Measuring Over-Refusal and Robustness in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10846)
*Kaixuan Ren,Preslav Nakov,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DUAL-Bench，首个专注于多模态模型中过度拒绝和安全完成问题的基准测试，评估了18个视觉语言模型在12种危险类别中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在安全性和实用性之间存在平衡问题，安全机制可能导致过度拒绝，即在无害请求上过度谨慎地拒绝。现有基准未能系统解决视觉模态中的过度拒绝问题。

Method: 创建DUAL-Bench基准，包含双重使用场景（指令无害但图像包含有害内容），评估模型在语义保持的视觉扰动下的鲁棒性。

Result: 模型表现有显著改进空间：GPT-5-Nano达到12.9%的安全完成率，GPT-5模型平均7.9%，Qwen模型仅3.9%。

Conclusion: DUAL-Bench将促进开发更精细的对齐策略，确保模型在复杂多模态环境中既安全又实用。

Abstract: As vision-language models become increasingly capable, maintaining a balance
between safety and usefulness remains a central challenge. Safety mechanisms,
while essential, can backfire, causing over-refusal, where models decline
benign requests out of excessive caution. Yet, no existing benchmark has
systematically addressed over-refusal in the visual modality. This setting
introduces unique challenges, such as dual-use cases where an instruction is
harmless, but the accompanying image contains harmful content. Models
frequently fail in such scenarios, either refusing too conservatively or
completing tasks unsafely, which highlights the need for more fine-grained
alignment. The ideal behavior is safe completion, i.e., fulfilling the benign
parts of a request while explicitly warning about any potentially harmful
elements. To address this, we present DUAL-Bench, the first multimodal
benchmark focused on over-refusal and safe completion in VLMs. We evaluated 18
VLMs across 12 hazard categories, with focus on their robustness under
semantics-preserving visual perturbations. The results reveal substantial room
for improvement: GPT-5-Nano achieves 12.9% safe completion, GPT-5 models
average 7.9%, and Qwen models only 3.9%. We hope that DUAL-Bench will foster
the development of more nuanced alignment strategies that ensure models remain
both safe and useful in complex multimodal settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了6种轻量级测试时扩展策略和4种LLM在Text-to-SQL任务上的表现，发现分治提示和少样本演示能持续提升性能，但额外工作流程步骤效果不一，基础模型选择至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然测试时扩展策略在LLM解决方案中显示出潜力，但其在真实世界应用中的有效性，特别是与最新推理模型结合时，仍不确定。

Method: 在BIRD Mini-Dev基准上对6种轻量级、面向工业的测试时扩展策略和4种LLM（包括2种推理模型）进行基准测试，除了标准准确率指标外，还报告推理延迟和token消耗。

Result: 分治提示和少样本演示能持续提升通用和推理型LLM的性能，但引入额外工作流程步骤效果不一，基础模型选择对性能影响显著。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了在部署Text2SQL系统时，准确率、效率和复杂性之间的实际权衡关系。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly powering Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL)
systems, enabling non-expert users to query industrial databases using natural
language. While test-time scaling strategies have shown promise in LLM-based
solutions, their effectiveness in real-world applications, especially with the
latest reasoning models, remains uncertain. In this work, we benchmark six
lightweight, industry-oriented test-time scaling strategies and four LLMs,
including two reasoning models, evaluating their performance on the BIRD
Mini-Dev benchmark. Beyond standard accuracy metrics, we also report inference
latency and token consumption, providing insights relevant for practical system
deployment. Our findings reveal that Divide-and-Conquer prompting and few-shot
demonstrations consistently enhance performance for both general-purpose and
reasoning-focused LLMs. However, introducing additional workflow steps yields
mixed results, and base model selection plays a critical role. This work sheds
light on the practical trade-offs between accuracy, efficiency, and complexity
when deploying Text2SQL systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM x MapReduce-V3是一个分层模块化代理系统，用于生成长篇综述。它采用多智能体架构，将功能组件实现为独立的MCP服务器，并通过高层规划器动态协调工作流程，支持人机交互干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于先前工作LLM x MapReduce-V2，旨在通过模块化分解促进人机交互干预，为用户提供更大的控制和定制能力，精确捕捉研究视角来生成全面的综述。

Method: 采用分层模块化架构，将骨架初始化、摘要构建和骨架优化等功能组件实现为独立的MCP服务器，这些服务器可聚合成更高层服务器。高层规划器根据MCP工具描述和执行历史动态选择模块。

Result: 人类评估表明，该系统在内容深度和长度方面均优于代表性基线，突显了基于MCP的模块化规划的优势。

Conclusion: LLM x MapReduce-V3通过分层模块化设计和MCP服务器架构，有效支持了长篇综述的生成，提供了更好的控制和定制能力，在内容质量上表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce LLM x MapReduce-V3, a hierarchically modular agent system
designed for long-form survey generation. Building on the prior work, LLM x
MapReduce-V2, this version incorporates a multi-agent architecture where
individual functional components, such as skeleton initialization, digest
construction, and skeleton refinement, are implemented as independent
model-context-protocol (MCP) servers. These atomic servers can be aggregated
into higher-level servers, creating a hierarchically structured system. A
high-level planner agent dynamically orchestrates the workflow by selecting
appropriate modules based on their MCP tool descriptions and the execution
history. This modular decomposition facilitates human-in-the-loop intervention,
affording users greater control and customization over the research process.
Through a multi-turn interaction, the system precisely captures the intended
research perspectives to generate a comprehensive skeleton, which is then
developed into an in-depth survey. Human evaluations demonstrate that our
system surpasses representative baselines in both content depth and length,
highlighting the strength of MCP-based modular planning.

TL;DR: 论文提出ADVICE框架，通过微调使大语言模型能够基于自身答案进行置信度估计，解决置信度与答案不相关导致的过度自信问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然能用自然语言表达置信度，但经常表现出过度自信，且这种过度自信的原因尚不清楚。

Method: 提出ADVICE（答案依赖的置信度估计）微调框架，促进基于答案的置信度估计。

Result: 实验表明ADVICE显著改善了置信度校准，同时保持了任务性能。进一步分析确认ADVICE增强了答案相关性，产生了更平衡和良好校准的置信度分布。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了过度自信的根源，并为更可信的置信度表达建立了框架。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled them to express
their confidence in natural language, enhancing transparency and reliability.
However, their confidence often exhibits overconfidence, the cause of which
remains poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a detailed analysis of the
dynamics underlying verbalized confidence and identify answer-independence as a
key factor, defined as the model's failure to condition confidence on its own
answer. To address this, we propose ADVICE (Answer-Dependent Verbalized
Confidence Estimation), a fine-tuning framework that facilitates
answer-grounded confidence estimation. Extensive experiments show that ADVICE
substantially improves confidence calibration while preserving task
performance. Further analyses confirm that ADVICE strengthens
answer-groundedness, leading to more balanced and well-calibrated confidence
distributions. Our findings shed light on the origin of overconfidence and
establish a framework for more trustworthy confidence verbalization.

TL;DR: 提出GapDNER模型，通过表示学习实体片段间的上下文间隙来解决不连续命名实体识别中的解码歧义问题，在三个数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学领域中的命名实体通常由非相邻标记组成且与其他实体重叠，现有方法在识别不连续实体时面临错误传播和解码歧义挑战。

Method: 将上下文间隙作为额外的span类型，将span分类转换为token对网格标注任务，设计两个交互组件从span内和span间角度建模网格特征，使用BFS算法进行实体解码。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验结果表明，GapDNER在不连续NER任务上达到了新的最先进性能，在识别复杂实体结构方面表现出显著优势。

Conclusion: GapDNER通过创新性地建模上下文间隙表示，有效解决了不连续命名实体识别中的解码歧义问题，提升了复杂实体结构的识别能力。

Abstract: In biomedical fields, one named entity may consist of a series of
non-adjacent tokens and overlap with other entities. Previous methods recognize
discontinuous entities by connecting entity fragments or internal tokens, which
face challenges of error propagation and decoding ambiguity due to the wide
variety of span or word combinations. To address these issues, we deeply
explore discontinuous entity structures and propose an effective Gap-aware grid
tagging model for Discontinuous Named Entity Recognition, named GapDNER. Our
GapDNER innovatively applies representation learning on the context gaps
between entity fragments to resolve decoding ambiguity and enhance
discontinuous NER performance. Specifically, we treat the context gap as an
additional type of span and convert span classification into a token-pair grid
tagging task. Subsequently, we design two interactive components to
comprehensively model token-pair grid features from both intra- and inter-span
perspectives. The intra-span regularity extraction module employs the biaffine
mechanism along with linear attention to capture the internal regularity of
each span, while the inter-span relation enhancement module utilizes
criss-cross attention to obtain semantic relations among different spans. At
the inference stage of entity decoding, we assign a directed edge to each
entity fragment and context gap, then use the BFS algorithm to search for all
valid paths from the head to tail of grids with entity tags. Experimental
results on three datasets demonstrate that our GapDNER achieves new
state-of-the-art performance on discontinuous NER and exhibits remarkable
advantages in recognizing complex entity structures.

TL;DR: 本文提出评估AI系统如何评估游戏的新范式，通过比较语言和推理模型与人类在游戏公平性和趣味性评估上的表现，发现推理模型更接近人类判断，但存在非单调关系和资源使用不稳定的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI评估主要关注问题解决能力，本文主张评估AI系统如何评估游戏本身，填补AI系统在价值判断和评估能力方面的研究空白。

Method: 使用包含100多个新颖棋盘游戏和450多个人类判断的大规模数据集，比较现代语言和推理模型与人类及符号计算代理在游戏公平性和趣味性评估上的表现。

Result: 推理模型在游戏评估上比非推理语言模型更接近人类判断，但随着模型接近博弈论最优，与人类数据的拟合度反而下降。评估趣味性时模型表现更不稳定，且推理模型的资源使用高度可变。

Conclusion: 需要在语言和推理模型中注入更多资源理性的元推理能力，以提高评估的稳定性和可预测性。

Abstract: Reasoning is not just about solving problems -- it is also about evaluating
which problems are worth solving at all. Evaluations of artificial intelligence
(AI) systems primarily focused on problem solving, historically by studying how
models play games such as chess and Go. In this paper, we advocate for a new
paradigm that assesses AI systems' evaluation of games. First, we introduce a
formalism for evaluating such evaluations. We then leverage a large-scale
dataset of over $100$ novel board games and over 450 human judgments to compare
evaluations produced by modern language and reasoning models against those of
people and symbolic computational agents. We consider two kinds of evaluative
queries: assessing the payoff (or fairness) and the funness of games. These
queries span two dimensions relevant to the design of evaluations of AI
evaluations: how complex a query is to compute and how difficult a query is to
quantify. Our results show that reasoning models are generally more aligned to
people in their evaluations of games than non-reasoning language models.
However, we observe a non-monotonic relationship: as models get closer to
game-theoretic optimal, their fit to human data weakens. We also observe more
"jaggedness" across models for assessing funness, in line with the greater
difficulty of quantifying this query. Across queries and games, reasoning
models show highly variable and unpredictable resource usage when assessing
queries, pointing to the importance of imbuing more resource-rational
meta-reasoning in language and reasoning models.

Motivation: 验证BiLSTM-CNN-CRF这一端到端序列标注架构的可复现性，该模型无需手工特征工程即可在NER和POS标注任务中取得优异性能。

Method: 使用字符级CNN提取字符表示，通过BiLSTM建模词级上下文，最后用CRF进行结构化预测，构建端到端的序列标注模型。

Result: 在CoNLL-2003 NER任务上获得91.18%的F1分数，成功复现了原始论文的关键结果，证明了模型在序列标注任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: BiLSTM-CNN-CRF架构具有很好的可复现性，该研究提供了详细的架构分析和开源PyTorch实现，有助于推动相关研究发展。

Abstract: We present a reproducibility study of the state-of-the-art neural
architecture for sequence labeling proposed by Ma and Hovy
(2016)\cite{ma2016end}. The original BiLSTM-CNN-CRF model combines
character-level representations via Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),
word-level context modeling through Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory
networks (BiLSTMs), and structured prediction using Conditional Random Fields
(CRFs). This end-to-end approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted features
while achieving excellent performance on named entity recognition (NER) and
part-of-speech (POS) tagging tasks. Our implementation successfully reproduces
the key results, achieving 91.18\% F1-score on CoNLL-2003 NER and demonstrating
the model's effectiveness across sequence labeling tasks. We provide a detailed
analysis of the architecture components and release an open-source PyTorch
implementation to facilitate further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的二值化流程在头部选择前会丢弃标点符号，这会改变成分结构并损害头部-子节点识别。

Method: 开发了一个可复现的流程，在二值化前将标点符号保留为兄弟节点，并提供了派生产物、元数据和评估套件。

Result: 在Penn Treebank上，标点感知预处理将头部预测准确率从73.66%（Collins规则）和86.66%（MLP）提升到91.85%，并在CCGbank推导上实现了竞争性的对齐。

Conclusion: 该资源包能够实现复制并扩展到其他语料库，为树库二值化提供了改进的预处理方法。

Abstract: This article presents a curated resource and evaluation suite for
punctuation-aware treebank binarization. Standard binarization pipelines drop
punctuation before head selection, which alters constituent shape and harms
head-child identification. We release (1) a reproducible pipeline that
preserves punctuation as sibling nodes prior to binarization, (2) derived
artifacts and metadata (intermediate @X markers, reversibility signatures,
alignment indices), and (3) an accompanying evaluation suite covering
head-child prediction, round-trip reversibility, and structural compatibility
with derivational resources (CCGbank). On the Penn Treebank, punctuation-aware
preprocessing improves head prediction accuracy from 73.66\% (Collins rules)
and 86.66\% (MLP) to 91.85\% with the same classifier, and achieves competitive
alignment against CCGbank derivations. All code, configuration files, and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有毒性内容检测和去毒化研究主要集中于英语，低资源语言代表性不足，LLM难以识别和中和这些语言中的毒性表达，特别是当用户使用混淆技术规避检测时。

Method: 基于韩语语言特征分类各种混淆方法，定义基于真实示例的转换规则，构建三个难度级别（简单、普通、困难）的数据集版本。

Result: 构建了首个同时支持韩语去混淆和去毒化的数据集，包含不同混淆难度级别的数据。

Conclusion: KOTOX数据集有助于更好地理解和减轻低资源语言中LLM对混淆毒性内容的问题，促进相关研究发展。

Abstract: Toxic content has become an increasingly critical social issue with the rapid
expansion of online communication. While numerous studies explored methods for
detecting and detoxifying such content, most have focused primarily on English,
leaving low-resource language underrepresented. Consequently, Large Language
Models~(LLMs) often struggle to identify and neutralize toxic expressions in
these languages. This challenge becomes even more pronounced when user employ
obfuscation techniques to evade detection systems. Therefore, we propose a
\textbf{KOTOX: Korean Toxic Dataset} for deobfuscation and detoxicification to
address this issue. We categorize various obfuscation approaches based on
linguistic characteristics of Korean and define a set of transformation rules
grounded in real-word examples. Using these rules, we construct three dataset
versions (easy, normal, and hard) representing different levels of obfuscation
difficulty. This is the first dataset that simultaneously supports
deobfuscation and detoxification for the Korean language. We expect it to
facilitate better understanding and mitigating of obfuscated toxic content in
LLM for low-resource languages. Our code and data are available at
https://github.com/leeyejin1231/KOTOX.

*Jidong Li,Lingyong Fang,Haodong Zhao,Sufeng Duan,Gongshen Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个自动化构建虚假前提问题基准的方法，创建了JBA数据集，并开发了增强MLLMs识别虚假前提能力的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的虚假前提问题基准范围有限，缺乏细粒度分类和充分覆盖，无法严格评估模型识别虚假前提的能力。

Method: 开发了全自动构建虚假前提问题基准的流程，将前提系统分为3个主要类型和13个子类型，并提出了识别增强框架来提升MLLMs的鲁棒性。

Result: 当前MLLMs在虚假前提识别方面仍然存在困难，但使用所提框架训练的模型在虚假前提识别方面取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 提出的基准和增强框架有效提升了MLLMs识别虚假前提的能力，为评估和改进模型鲁棒性提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have witnessed astonishing
advancements in recent years. Despite these successes, MLLMs remain vulnerable
to flase premise problems. However, existing benchmarks targeting this issue
are limited in scope: they often lack fine-grained categorization, exhibit
insufficient coverage, and thus fail to provide a rigorous evaluation of the
ability of models to recognize false premises. To bridge this gap, we introduce
a fully automated pipeline for constructing a comprehensive benchmark of false
premise questions. Our method systematically categorizes the premises into
three main types and thirteen subtypes according to the abilities required to
identify the premises, resulting in the JBA dataset.Results show current MLLMs
still struggle with false premise recognition. Building upon this benchmark, we
further propose a recognition enhancement framework tailored to strengthen the
robustness of MLLMs to detect false premises. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that models trained with our framework achieve significant improvements in
false premise recognition.

*Yejin Lee,Hyeseon Ahn,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了RV-HATE框架，通过强化学习优化多个专门模块的权重，针对不同仇恨言论数据集的特征进行自适应检测，提高准确率并提供可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仇恨言论在不同平台和来源的数据集中表现出多样性特征，但现有检测方法往往采用固定方法，未能适应数据集特定特征。

Method: RV-HATE框架包含多个专门模块，每个模块关注仇恨言论的不同语言或上下文特征，使用强化学习优化模块权重，并通过投票机制聚合结果。

Result: 该方法有效处理隐含仇恨言论，相比传统静态方法获得更优性能。

Conclusion: RV-HATE通过自适应数据集特征提高了仇恨言论检测的准确性和可解释性，为处理多样化的仇恨言论数据集提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Hate speech remains prevalent in human society and continues to evolve in its
forms and expressions. Modern advancements in internet and online anonymity
accelerate its rapid spread and complicate its detection. However, hate speech
datasets exhibit diverse characteristics primarily because they are constructed
from different sources and platforms, each reflecting different linguistic
styles and social contexts. Despite this diversity, prior studies on hate
speech detection often rely on fixed methodologies without adapting to
data-specific features. We introduce RV-HATE, a detection framework designed to
account for the dataset-specific characteristics of each hate speech dataset.
RV-HATE consists of multiple specialized modules, where each module focuses on
distinct linguistic or contextual features of hate speech. The framework
employs reinforcement learning to optimize weights that determine the
contribution of each module for a given dataset. A voting mechanism then
aggregates the module outputs to produce the final decision. RV-HATE offers two
primary advantages: (1)~it improves detection accuracy by tailoring the
detection process to dataset-specific attributes, and (2)~it also provides
interpretable insights into the distinctive features of each dataset.
Consequently, our approach effectively addresses implicit hate speech and
achieves superior performance compared to conventional static methods. Our code
is available at https://github.com/leeyejin1231/RV-HATE.

### [323] [Enhancing Large Language Model Reasoning via Selective Critical Token Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10974)
*Zhiwen Ruan,Yixia Li,He Zhu,Yun Chen,Peng Li,Yang Liu,Guanhua Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Critical Token Fine-tuning (CFT)方法，仅对通过反事实扰动识别出的关键推理令牌进行微调，在数学推理任务上优于标准监督微调，同时保持输出多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准监督微调(SFT)对所有令牌进行统一惩罚，忽略了只有少量关键令牌决定推理正确性，导致输出多样性减少和泛化能力有限。

Method: CFT方法通过反事实扰动识别功能上不可或缺的关键令牌，仅对这些决定性推理步骤进行梯度更新，同时保留非关键令牌的多样性。

Result: 在5个模型、3个模型家族(Qwen、OLMo、LLaMA)和11个数学推理基准测试中，CFT仅微调不到12%的令牌，但始终优于标准SFT。

Conclusion: CFT是一个实用且通用的框架，可实现高效和稳健的LLM微调，通过改进采样多样性实现测试时扩展，并为强化学习提供更强的初始化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
as a key method to adapt pre-trained models to domain-specific tasks such as
mathematical reasoning. However, standard SFT uniformly penalizes all tokens,
neglecting that only a small subset of critical tokens determines reasoning
correctness. This uniform supervision often causes reduced output diversity and
limited generalization. We propose Critical Token Fine-tuning (CFT), a simple
yet effective approach that updates only tokens identified as functionally
indispensable via counterfactual perturbations. By focusing gradient signals on
these decisive reasoning steps while preserving the diversity of non-critical
tokens, CFT can enhance both generation and diversity. Extensive experiments on
five models across three families (Qwen, OLMo, LLaMA) and eleven mathematical
reasoning benchmarks show that CFT, despite fine-tuning on less than 12% of
tokens, consistently outperforms standard SFT. Moreover, CFT enables test-time
scaling through improved sampling diversity and provides a stronger
initialization for reinforcement learning, sustaining performance gains in
later training stages while maintaining higher entropy for better exploration.
These results highlight CFT as a practical and general framework for efficient
and robust LLM fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DEEPRESEARCHGUARD框架，通过四阶段保护机制解决深度研究框架中评估不足和安全性问题，显著提升防御成功率并降低过度拒绝率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度研究框架缺乏充分的评估程序和阶段特定保护，通常只关注问答准确率而忽视报告质量的关键方面（可信度、连贯性、广度、深度和安全性），可能导致危险或恶意来源被整合到最终报告中。

Method: 引入DEEPRESEARCHGUARD框架，包含四阶段保护机制，进行开放域参考和报告评估，并创建DRSAFEBENCH阶段式安全基准。评估多种先进LLM模型。

Result: DEEPRESEARCHGUARD平均防御成功率提升18.16%，过度拒绝率降低6%。输入防护提供最显著的早期保护，计划和研究防护增强引用纪律和来源可信度。

Conclusion: DEEPRESEARCHGUARD能够实现全面的开放域评估和阶段感知防御，有效阻止有害内容传播，同时系统性提高报告质量而不过度拒绝。

Abstract: Deep research frameworks have shown promising capabilities in synthesizing
comprehensive reports from web sources. While deep research possesses
significant potential to address complex issues through planning and research
cycles, existing frameworks are deficient in sufficient evaluation procedures
and stage-specific protections. They typically treat evaluation as exact match
accuracy of question-answering, but overlook crucial aspects of report quality
such as credibility, coherence, breadth, depth, and safety. This oversight may
result in hazardous or malicious sources being integrated into the final
report. To address these issues, we introduce DEEPRESEARCHGUARD, a
comprehensive framework featuring four-stage safeguards with open-domain
evaluation of references and reports. We assess performance across multiple
metrics, e.g., defense success rate and over-refusal rate, and five key report
dimensions. In the absence of a suitable safety benchmark, we introduce
DRSAFEBENCH, a stage-wise benchmark for deep research safety. Our evaluation
spans diverse state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-flash,
DeepSeek-v3, and o4-mini. DEEPRESEARCHGUARD achieves an average defense success
rate improvement of 18.16% while reducing over-refusal rate by 6%. The input
guard provides the most substantial early-stage protection by filtering out
obvious risks, while the plan and research guards enhance citation discipline
and source credibility. Through extensive experiments, we show that
DEEPRESEARCHGUARD enables comprehensive open-domain evaluation and stage-aware
defenses that effectively block harmful content propagation, while
systematically improving report quality without excessive over-refusal rates.

*Mahika Phutane,Hayoung Jung,Matthew Kim,Tanushree Mitra,Aditya Vashistha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文对6个大型语言模型在2820个招聘场景中进行了审计，发现这些模型对残障人士存在显著的歧视性偏见，特别是当残障与性别、种姓等身份特征交叉时，偏见更加严重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注西方背景，忽视了全球南方地区残障人士因性别、种姓等多重边缘化身份而面临的交叉性歧视问题。

Method: 引入ABLEIST框架（包含5个残障歧视特定指标和3个交叉性伤害指标），对6个LLM在2820个招聘场景中进行全面审计。

Result: 发现LLM对残障候选人存在显著的ABLEIST伤害，且当前最先进的模型无法检测这些伤害。交叉性伤害（如象征主义）在性别和种姓边缘化的残障候选人中急剧增加。

Conclusion: 当前安全工具存在关键盲点，需要在招聘等高风险领域对前沿模型进行交叉性安全评估。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly under scrutiny for perpetuating
identity-based discrimination in high-stakes domains such as hiring,
particularly against people with disabilities (PwD). However, existing research
remains largely Western-centric, overlooking how intersecting forms of
marginalization--such as gender and caste--shape experiences of PwD in the
Global South. We conduct a comprehensive audit of six LLMs across 2,820 hiring
scenarios spanning diverse disability, gender, nationality, and caste profiles.
To capture subtle intersectional harms and biases, we introduce ABLEIST
(Ableism, Inspiration, Superhumanization, and Tokenism), a set of five
ableism-specific and three intersectional harm metrics grounded in disability
studies literature. Our results reveal significant increases in ABLEIST harms
towards disabled candidates--harms that many state-of-the-art models failed to
detect. These harms were further amplified by sharp increases in intersectional
harms (e.g., Tokenism) for gender and caste-marginalized disabled candidates,
highlighting critical blind spots in current safety tools and the need for
intersectional safety evaluations of frontier models in high-stakes domains
like hiring.

### [326] [DND: Boosting Large Language Models with Dynamic Nested Depth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11001)
*Tieyuan Chen,Xiaodong Chen,Haoxing Chen,Zhenzhong Lan,Weiyao Lin,Jianguo Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Dynamic Nested Depth (DND)方法，通过动态选择关键token进行嵌套深度处理来提升LLM性能，无需重新训练即可集成到预训练模型中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在处理复杂任务时，某些关键token需要更深入的处理，但传统方法对所有token进行相同深度的计算会造成资源浪费。

Method: 在transformer层结束时，使用路由器识别关键token，将其反馈进行额外处理轮次；采用路由器控制损失和阈值控制方案来确保选择的准确性和稳定性。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，将密集模型Qwen3-1.7B性能提升1.88%，MoE模型Qwen3-30B-A3B性能提升0.87%，参数和计算开销增加极小。

Conclusion: DND方法能有效提升LLM性能，通过动态选择关键token进行深度处理，在保持计算效率的同时实现性能增益。

Abstract: We introduce Dynamic Nested Depth (DND), a novel method that improves
performance for off-the-shelf LLMs by selecting critical tokens to reprocess in
a nested depth manner. Specifically, at the end of the given transformer layer,
DND identifies more critical tokens with a router and feeds them back for an
extra round of processing, effectively ``reviewing" difficult tokens while
avoiding redundant computation for easier ones. The dynamic selection mechanism
is tailored for precise control via two novel strategies: a router controlling
loss to enhance token selection distinguishability, and a threshold control
scheme to ensure selection stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DND
by directly integrating it into pre-trained dense and MoE models during a
post-training phase. On diverse benchmarks, this approach boosts the
performances of the dense Qwen3-1.7B by 1.88% and the MoE Qwen3-30B-A3B by
0.87%, all with a minimal parameter and computing increase.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LogiNumSynth是一个灵活的自然语言问题合成器，能够生成需要逻辑推理和数值推理能力的联合推理任务，支持对推理世界丰富度、逻辑推理深度和数值计算复杂度的细粒度控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联合逻辑-数值推理数据集依赖固定规则集，任务复杂度控制有限，限制了其在评估和训练中的通用性。

Method: 开发LogiNumSynth合成器，支持合成完全可控的自然语言联合推理任务，能够灵活控制推理难度级别。

Result: 实验显示多个LLM在逻辑-数值推理方面存在持续弱点，LogiNumSynth可作为诊断工具和针对性监督源。

Conclusion: LogiNumSynth能够作为诊断工具和针对性训练数据源，推动集成推理技能的发展。

Abstract: Joint logical-numerical reasoning remains a major challenge for language
models, yet existing datasets rely on fixed rule sets and offer limited control
over task complexity, constraining their generalizability for evaluation and
training. We present LogiNumSynth, a flexible natural language problem
synthesizer that synthesizes tasks requiring proficiency in joint logical
reasoning (e.g., rule-based reasoning) and numerical reasoning (e.g.,
arithmetic computation). LogiNumSynth supports fine-grained control over
reasoning world richness, logical reasoning depth, and the complexity of
numerical computations, enabling flexible data synthesis across difficulty
levels. We demonstrate three key contributions: (1) Synthesizer -- synthesizing
fully controllable joint reasoning tasks over natural language; (2) Evaluation
& Process Analysis -- evaluating both process accuracy and answer accuracy; (3)
Targeted Training -- using synthesized data to enhance LLMs' reasoning
performance. Experiments with multiple LLMs highlight persistent weaknesses in
logical-numerical reasoning, showing that LogiNumSynth can serve as both a
diagnostic tool and a source of targeted supervision for advancing integrated
reasoning skills.

TL;DR: 该论文提出将大语言模型重新定位为临床助理，与医生协作而非直接面向患者，构建了DoctorFLAN中文医疗数据集和评估基准，显著提升了开源LLM在医疗场景的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在医疗领域应用存在安全风险，因其领域专业知识有限。为避免直接面向患者带来的风险，需要重新定位LLM为医生助手，与经验丰富的医生协作。

Method: 通过两阶段启发-反馈调查识别临床工作流需求，构建包含92,000个问答实例的DoctorFLAN中文医疗数据集，涵盖22个临床任务和27个专科，并创建DoctorFLAN-test和DotaBench评估基准。

Result: 实验结果显示，DoctorFLAN显著提升了开源LLM在医疗场景的性能，促进了模型与医生工作流的对齐，补充了现有面向患者的模型。

Conclusion: 这项工作为推进以医生为中心的医疗LLM发展贡献了有价值的资源和框架。

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has transformed healthcare by
offering clinical guidance, yet their direct deployment to patients poses
safety risks due to limited domain expertise. To mitigate this, we propose
repositioning LLMs as clinical assistants that collaborate with experienced
physicians rather than interacting with patients directly. We conduct a
two-stage inspiration-feedback survey to identify real-world needs in clinical
workflows. Guided by this, we construct DoctorFLAN, a large-scale Chinese
medical dataset comprising 92,000 Q&A instances across 22 clinical tasks and 27
specialties. To evaluate model performance in doctor-facing applications, we
introduce DoctorFLAN-test (550 single-turn Q&A items) and DotaBench (74
multi-turn conversations). Experimental results with over ten popular LLMs
demonstrate that DoctorFLAN notably improves the performance of open-source
LLMs in medical contexts, facilitating their alignment with physician workflows
and complementing existing patient-oriented models. This work contributes a
valuable resource and framework for advancing doctor-centered medical LLM
development

TL;DR: LRD是一个两阶段并行解码框架，通过潜在精炼和预测反馈循环解决现有扩散式方法的信息丢失和过早承诺问题，在保持准确性的同时实现高达10.6倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自回归模型的高延迟问题，同时克服现有并行解码方法的信息丢失和局部决策缺乏全局协调的局限性。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段将掩码位置保持为预测标记和掩码嵌入的分布混合，建立全局一致信念；第二阶段逐步确定置信标记，保留不确定标记进行迭代反馈，使用KL散度动态作为收敛标准。

Result: 在编码任务（HumanEval +6.3，MBPP +2.6）和推理任务（GSM8K +2.9，MATH500 +3.8）上准确率提升，同时实现高达10.6倍的加速。

Conclusion: LRD是并行序列生成的强大且通用的替代方案，在保持准确性的同时显著提升解码速度。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models remain the standard for natural language
generation but still suffer from high latency due to strictly sequential
decoding. Recent diffusion-inspired approaches, such as LlaDA and Dream,
mitigate this by generating in parallel, yet they suffer from two core
limitations: information loss, as predictive distributions for non-finalized
tokens are discarded at each step, and premature commitment, where local
decisions are made without sufficient global coordination. We introduce Latent
Refinement Decoding (LRD), a two-stage framework with Latent Refinement and a
Predictive Feedback Loop. The first stage maintains masked positions as
distributional mixtures of predicted tokens and the mask embedding, allowing
the model to establish more globally consistent beliefs. The second stage
progressively finalizes confident tokens while retaining uncertain ones for
iterative feedback. KL-divergence dynamics provide a principled and reliable
criterion for convergence and early stopping. Experiments across coding
(HumanEval +6.3, MBPP +2.6) and reasoning (GSM8K +2.9, MATH500 +3.8) show that
LRD improves accuracy while delivering speedups of up to 10.6x, making it a
strong and versatile alternative for parallel sequence generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于置信度引导的推理路径偏好优化方法(CGPO)，通过识别模型推理过程中的最大不确定性点，应用自生成的非人类推理路径指导来缓解轨迹漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化LLM推理的方法往往引入对人类推理轨迹的训练偏差，依赖人类或更高能力模型的中间步骤标注限制了探索替代性、非人类推理路径，从而约束了可实现的性能。

Method: CGPO方法利用置信度信号识别模型推理过程中的最大不确定性点，并应用自生成的非人类推理路径指导来缓解轨迹漂移。

Result: 实验结果表明，在相同训练数据量下，使用小模型生成数据的CGPO方法在大多数情况下比使用强模型生成数据或人工标注的方法表现更好。

Conclusion: 置信度引导的推理路径偏好优化方法能够有效提升模型推理性能，特别是在代码和数学推理任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Current approaches for strengthening LLM reasoning tend to introduce a
training bias toward human-like reasoning trajectories. In step-wise preference
optimization, in particular, dependence on human or higher-capacity model
annotations for intermediate steps limits exploration of alternative,
non-human-like reasoning paths and thus constrains achievable performance.
Furthermore, through a small-scale pilot study, we observed that in
approximately 75% of cases, the model's first erroneous step occurs after the
lowest-confidence point. This suggests that guiding the model at its
lowest-confidence point before an error provides more accurate supervision than
locating the first explicit error. In this paper, we propose Confidence-Guided
Reasoning Path Preference Optimization (CGPO), a method that leverages a
confidence signal to identify points of maximal uncertainty in the model's
reasoning process and applies self-generated, non-human-like reasoning-path
guidance to mitigate trajectory drift. Our experiments span diverse models
applied to both code and mathematical reasoning tasks. The results show that,
with the same amount of training data, our method using data generated by a
small model can achieve better performance in most cases compared with
approaches using data generated by a strong model or human-annotated.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的代码常包含微妙但关键的安全漏洞，在安全敏感系统中部署时存在重大风险。

Method: 使用Scala作为代表性强类型语言，结合Stainless框架进行形式验证，构建类型导向的代理式AI管道。

Result: 实验表明，直接代码生成和简单提示难以保证安全约束，而类型导向的代理管道能显著减轻输入验证和注入漏洞。

Conclusion: 结构化、类型导向的LLM工作流程有潜力提升高保证领域自动代码生成的可信度。

Abstract: Large language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency in code
generation tasks across various programming languages. However, their outputs
often contain subtle but critical vulnerabilities, posing significant risks
when deployed in security-sensitive or mission-critical systems. This paper
introduces TypePilot, an agentic AI framework designed to enhance the security
and robustness of LLM-generated code by leveraging strongly typed and
verifiable languages, using Scala as a representative example. We evaluate the
effectiveness of our approach in two settings: formal verification with the
Stainless framework and general-purpose secure code generation. Our experiments
with leading open-source LLMs reveal that while direct code generation often
fails to enforce safety constraints, just as naive prompting for more secure
code, our type-focused agentic pipeline substantially mitigates input
validation and injection vulnerabilities. The results demonstrate the potential
of structured, type-guided LLM workflows to improve the SotA of the
trustworthiness of automated code generation in high-assurance domains.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于距离的无监督文本分类方法，通过优化标签特定阈值来提升多标签分类性能，相比传统阈值方法平均提升46%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于距离的无监督文本分类具有快速推理和适应扩展标签集的优势，但多标签分类中需要确定相似性阈值，现有方法在此方面研究不足。

Method: 首先探索不同模型、数据集和标签集之间的语义关系差异，然后提出使用验证集优化标签特定阈值的新方法。

Result: 标签特定阈值方法比标准化0.5阈值平均提升46%，比先前统一阈值方法平均提升14%，且在有限标注样本下表现良好。

Conclusion: 基于距离的无监督文本分类中，标签特定阈值优化能显著提升多标签分类性能，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Distance-based unsupervised text classification is a method within text
classification that leverages the semantic similarity between a label and a
text to determine label relevance. This method provides numerous benefits,
including fast inference and adaptability to expanding label sets, as opposed
to zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned neural networks that require re-training
in such cases. In multi-label distance-based classification and information
retrieval algorithms, thresholds are required to determine whether a text
instance is "similar" to a label or query. Similarity between a text and label
is determined in a dense embedding space, usually generated by state-of-the-art
sentence encoders. Multi-label classification complicates matters, as a text
instance can have multiple true labels, unlike in multi-class or binary
classification, where each instance is assigned only one label. We expand upon
previous literature on this underexplored topic by thoroughly examining and
evaluating the ability of sentence encoders to perform distance-based
classification. First, we perform an exploratory study to verify whether the
semantic relationships between texts and labels vary across models, datasets,
and label sets by conducting experiments on a diverse collection of realistic
multi-label text classification (MLTC) datasets. We find that similarity
distributions show statistically significant differences across models,
datasets and even label sets. We propose a novel method for optimizing
label-specific thresholds using a validation set. Our label-specific
thresholding method achieves an average improvement of 46% over normalized 0.5
thresholding and outperforms uniform thresholding approaches from previous work
by an average of 14%. Additionally, the method demonstrates strong performance
even with limited labeled examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仇恨言论对社会和个人构成严重威胁，但现有研究主要集中于英语，低资源语言缺乏足够的资源和基准。同时，这些语言常存在多种语言变体，而当前方法往往忽略这一因素。

Method: 通过系统分析和整合现有资源，构建了标准化的欧洲西班牙语仇恨言论数据集元集合，并将其翻译扩展到欧洲葡萄牙语和两种加利西亚语变体，创建对齐的多语言语料库。

Result: 建立了伊比利亚语言仇恨言论检测的新基准，评估了最先进的大语言模型在零样本、少样本和微调设置下的性能，提供了跨语言分析结果。

Conclusion: 研究强调了多语言和变体感知方法在仇恨言论检测中的重要性，为代表性不足的欧洲语言提供了改进基准的基础。

Abstract: Hate speech poses a serious threat to social cohesion and individual
well-being, particularly on social media, where it spreads rapidly. While
research on hate speech detection has progressed, it remains largely focused on
English, resulting in limited resources and benchmarks for low-resource
languages. Moreover, many of these languages have multiple linguistic
varieties, a factor often overlooked in current approaches. At the same time,
large language models require substantial amounts of data to perform reliably,
a requirement that low-resource languages often cannot meet. In this work, we
address these gaps by compiling a meta-collection of hate speech datasets for
European Spanish, standardised with unified labels and metadata. This
collection is based on a systematic analysis and integration of existing
resources, aiming to bridge the data gap and support more consistent and
scalable hate speech detection. We extended this collection by translating it
into European Portuguese and into a Galician standard that is more convergent
with Spanish and another Galician variant that is more convergent with
Portuguese, creating aligned multilingual corpora. Using these resources, we
establish new benchmarks for hate speech detection in Iberian languages. We
evaluate state-of-the-art large language models in zero-shot, few-shot, and
fine-tuning settings, providing baseline results for future research. Moreover,
we perform a cross-lingual analysis with our target languages. Our findings
underscore the importance of multilingual and variety-aware approaches in hate
speech detection and offer a foundation for improved benchmarking in
underrepresented European languages.

TL;DR: 提出了一个临床基础的评估框架，用于评估视觉语言模型在胸部X光视觉问答中思维链解释的忠实性，发现答案准确性与解释质量脱节，专有模型在归因方面表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型经常产生听起来合理但未能反映真实决策过程的思维链解释，这在临床高风险应用中会削弱信任。现有评估很少捕捉到这种不一致性。

Method: 通过控制文本和图像修改，在三个维度上评估思维链忠实性：临床保真度、因果归因和置信度校准。进行了读者研究（n=4），并与放射科医生进行比较。

Result: 评估者与放射科医生的相关性在所有维度上都落在观察到的放射科医生间范围内。专有模型在归因方面得分显著更高（25.0% vs 1.4%），在保真度方面也通常更高（36.1% vs 31.7%）。

Conclusion: 答案准确性和解释质量是脱节的，承认注入线索并不能确保基础，文本线索比视觉线索更能改变解释。需要超越最终答案准确性来评估模型。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often produce chain-of-thought (CoT)
explanations that sound plausible yet fail to reflect the underlying decision
process, undermining trust in high-stakes clinical use. Existing evaluations
rarely catch this misalignment, prioritizing answer accuracy or adherence to
formats. We present a clinically grounded framework for chest X-ray visual
question answering (VQA) that probes CoT faithfulness via controlled text and
image modifications across three axes: clinical fidelity, causal attribution,
and confidence calibration. In a reader study (n=4), evaluator-radiologist
correlations fall within the observed inter-radiologist range for all axes,
with strong alignment for attribution (Kendall's $\tau_b=0.670$), moderate
alignment for fidelity ($\tau_b=0.387$), and weak alignment for confidence tone
($\tau_b=0.091$), which we report with caution. Benchmarking six VLMs shows
that answer accuracy and explanation quality are decoupled, acknowledging
injected cues does not ensure grounding, and text cues shift explanations more
than visual cues. While some open-source models match final answer accuracy,
proprietary models score higher on attribution (25.0% vs. 1.4%) and often on
fidelity (36.1% vs. 31.7%), highlighting deployment risks and the need to
evaluate beyond final answer accuracy.

### [335] [Discursive Circuits: How Do Language Models Understand Discourse Relations?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11210)
*Yisong Miao,Min-Yen Kan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文通过引入Completion under Discourse Relation (CuDR)任务，在GPT-2模型中发现了稀疏的语篇理解电路（约0.2%的模型参数），这些电路能够泛化到不同的语篇框架，并揭示了不同层级的语言特征分工。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究变压器语言模型中哪些组件负责语篇理解，假设存在稀疏的计算图（语篇电路）控制模型处理语篇关系的过程。

Method: 引入CuDR任务，构建用于激活修补的最小对比对语料库，通过电路发现方法识别负责语篇理解的稀疏计算子图。

Result: 发现稀疏电路（约GPT-2模型的0.2%）能够恢复英语PDTB语料库上的语篇理解能力，这些电路能泛化到RST和SDRT等未见语篇框架。

Conclusion: 下层网络捕捉词汇语义和指代等语言特征，上层网络编码语篇级抽象，特征效用在不同语篇框架中保持一致。

Abstract: Which components in transformer language models are responsible for discourse
understanding? We hypothesize that sparse computational graphs, termed as
discursive circuits, control how models process discourse relations. Unlike
simpler tasks, discourse relations involve longer spans and complex reasoning.
To make circuit discovery feasible, we introduce a task called Completion under
Discourse Relation (CuDR), where a model completes a discourse given a
specified relation. To support this task, we construct a corpus of minimal
contrastive pairs tailored for activation patching in circuit discovery.
Experiments show that sparse circuits ($\approx 0.2\%$ of a full GPT-2 model)
recover discourse understanding in the English PDTB-based CuDR task. These
circuits generalize well to unseen discourse frameworks such as RST and SDRT.
Further analysis shows lower layers capture linguistic features such as lexical
semantics and coreference, while upper layers encode discourse-level
abstractions. Feature utility is consistent across frameworks (e.g.,
coreference supports Expansion-like relations).

TL;DR: RAGen是一个可扩展的模块化框架，用于生成领域特定的问答上下文三元组，以增强RAG系统在专业领域的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG系统在领域特定场景下缺乏专门的训练数据，需要能够生成上下文丰富的问答对来支持不同的RAG适配方法。

Method: 通过识别文档关键概念、基于Bloom分类学原理生成多样化问题、从相关上下文中提取精确答案，构建问答上下文三元组。支持语义分块、层次概念提取、多块检索等模块化流程。

Result: 开发了一个可扩展框架，能够高效处理大规模动态文档语料库，无需冗余处理，特别适用于科学研究和企业知识库等动态领域。

Conclusion: RAGen为RAG系统在领域特定场景下的有效适配提供了可扩展的解决方案，支持多种RAG组件优化策略。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the language understanding and
reasoning power of large language models (LLMs) with external retrieval to
enable domain-grounded responses. Effectively adapting RAG systems to
domain-specific settings requires specialized, context-rich training data
beyond general-purpose question-answering. Here, we propose RAGen, a scalable
and modular framework for generating domain-grounded question-answer-context
(QAC) triples tailored to diverse RAG adaptation approaches. RAGen produces
these QAC triples by identifying key concepts in documents, generating diverse
questions guided by Bloom's Taxonomy-inspired principles, and pairing them with
precise answers extracted from relevant contexts. RAGen supports multiple RAG
adaptation strategies, including the optimization of key components such as the
LLM, retriever, and embedding model, etc. Its modular pipeline features
semantic chunking, hierarchical concept extraction, and multi-chunk retrieval,
along with the introduction of curated distractor contexts to promote robust
reasoning. Designed for scalability, RAGen efficiently handles large and
evolving document corpora without redundant processing, making it especially
suitable for dynamic evolving domains such as scientific research and
enterprise knowledge bases.

*Saad Obaid ul Islam,Anne Lauscher,Goran Glavaš*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLAQ框架揭示了LLMs在简单和复杂查询中回答相同事实问题时存在系统性不一致，挑战了当前评估实践认为简单事实查询表现好就意味着复杂任务可靠的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在简单事实问答基准上表现准确，但在复杂查询中可靠性下降，这种可靠性差距尚未被充分理解，削弱了模型的可信度。

Method: 引入SLAQ评估框架，比较LLMs对相同事实问题在孤立形式（短查询）和集成到复杂查询中（长查询）的回答，分析了16个LLM在600个查询上的表现。

Result: 发现短查询和长查询答案存在系统性不一致，存在位置依赖的准确性损失和动量效应，机制分析显示对齐事实激活重叠的模型内部结构，基于机制相似性的指标可预测对齐度达78%准确率。

Conclusion: 事实一致性是LLMs可信度的重要方面，当前评估实践需要重新考虑，不能简单假设简单事实查询表现好就意味着复杂知识寻求任务可靠。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can correctly answer "When was Einstein born?"
yet fail to provide the same date when writing about Einstein's life revealing
a fundamental inconsistency in how models access factual knowledge across task
complexities. While models display impressive accuracy on factual
question-answering benchmarks, the reliability gap between simple and complex
queries remains poorly understood, eroding their trustworthiness. In this work,
we introduce Short-Long Form Alignment for Factual Question Answering (SLAQ), a
controlled evaluation framework that compares LLMs' answers to the same factual
questions asked (a) in isolation (short) vs. (b) integrated into complex
queries (long). Looking at 16 LLMs across 600 queries, we find a systematic
misalignment of answers to the corresponding short and long queries. We further
uncover position-dependent accuracy loss and momentum effects where consecutive
correct or incorrect answers create self-reinforcing patterns. Through
mechanistic analysis, we find that aligned facts activate overlapping model
internals, and that metrics based on mechanistic similarity can predict
short-long answer alignment with up to 78% accuracy. Our work establishes
factual consistency over query complexity as an important aspect of LLMs'
trustworthiness and challenges current evaluation practices, which implicitly
assume that good performance for simple factual queries implies reliability in
more complex knowledge-seeking tasks too.

TL;DR: WebRouter是一个基于信息论的查询特定路由器，通过成本感知变分信息瓶颈目标来压缩输入提示，显著降低LLM驱动的网页代理的运营成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM驱动的网页代理面临的成本-性能权衡问题，特别是由于复杂提示导致的LLM集成性能下降。

Method: 提出WebRouter，采用成本感知变分信息瓶颈目标，学习输入提示的压缩表示，同时明确惩罚预期运营成本。

Result: 在WebVoyager基准的五个真实网站上的实验表明，相比GPT-4o基线，WebRouter将运营成本降低了87.8%，仅带来3.8%的准确率下降。

Conclusion: WebRouter通过信息论方法有效解决了网页代理的成本-性能权衡问题，实现了显著的成本节约和性能保持。

Abstract: LLM-brained web agents offer powerful capabilities for web automation but
face a critical cost-performance trade-off. The challenge is amplified by web
agents' inherently complex prompts that include goals, action histories, and
environmental states, leading to degraded LLM ensemble performance. To address
this, we introduce WebRouter, a novel query-specific router trained from an
information-theoretic perspective. Our core contribution is a cost-aware
Variational Information Bottleneck (ca-VIB) objective, which learns a
compressed representation of the input prompt while explicitly penalizing the
expected operational cost. Experiments on five real-world websites from the
WebVoyager benchmark show that WebRouter reduces operational costs by a
striking 87.8\% compared to a GPT-4o baseline, while incurring only a 3.8\%
accuracy drop.

*Battemuulen Naranbat,Seyed Sahand Mohammadi Ziabari,Yousuf Nasser Al Husaini,Ali Mohammed Mansoor Alsahag*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了NLP中道德情感分类的公平性问题，特别是在跨域场景下。通过引入道德公平一致性(MFC)指标，揭示了总体性能指标可能掩盖的公平性违规，特别是在权威标签上表现明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在跨域场景下，基于transformer的道德情感分类模型可能存在公平性问题，但总体性能指标往往会掩盖这些不公平现象，需要专门的评估指标来识别和量化这些问题。

Method: 使用Moral Foundations Twitter Corpus和Moral Foundations Reddit Corpus，在BERT和DistilBERT模型上进行多标签分类实验，采用域内和跨域协议，并提出了Moral Fairness Consistency(MFC)指标来评估跨域公平性稳定性。

Result: 发现跨域转移存在明显不对称性：Twitter->Reddit的micro-F1下降14.9%，而Reddit->Twitter仅下降1.5%。权威标签表现出最严重的公平性违规，人口统计奇偶差异达0.22-0.23，均衡赔率差异达0.40-0.41。忠诚标签具有最高的MFC一致性(0.96)，权威标签最低(0.78)。

Conclusion: MFC指标作为补充性、诊断导向的公平性评估指标，与人口统计奇偶差异呈完美负相关，且独立于标准性能指标，能够更可靠地评估道德推理模型在不同语言环境中的部署效果。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in natural language processing for moral sentiment
classification is challenging, particularly under cross-domain shifts where
transformer models are increasingly deployed. Using the Moral Foundations
Twitter Corpus (MFTC) and Moral Foundations Reddit Corpus (MFRC), this work
evaluates BERT and DistilBERT in a multi-label setting with in-domain and
cross-domain protocols. Aggregate performance can mask disparities: we observe
pronounced asymmetry in transfer, with Twitter->Reddit degrading micro-F1 by
14.9% versus only 1.5% for Reddit->Twitter. Per-label analysis reveals fairness
violations hidden by overall scores; notably, the authority label exhibits
Demographic Parity Differences of 0.22-0.23 and Equalized Odds Differences of
0.40-0.41. To address this gap, we introduce the Moral Fairness Consistency
(MFC) metric, which quantifies the cross-domain stability of moral foundation
detection. MFC shows strong empirical validity, achieving a perfect negative
correlation with Demographic Parity Difference (rho = -1.000, p < 0.001) while
remaining independent of standard performance metrics. Across labels, loyalty
demonstrates the highest consistency (MFC = 0.96) and authority the lowest (MFC
= 0.78). These findings establish MFC as a complementary, diagnosis-oriented
metric for fairness-aware evaluation of moral reasoning models, enabling more
reliable deployment across heterogeneous linguistic contexts. .

*Hayate Funakura,Hyunsoo Kim,Koji Mineshima*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文重新评估了语义解析器的评估方法，将图匹配与自动定理证明相结合，发现基于图匹配的评估指标（如Smatch）不能很好地反映逻辑等价性，并提出了逻辑敏感的评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语义解析器评估主要使用图匹配指标（如Smatch），但这些指标只捕捉表面重叠而非逻辑等价性，无法满足推理导向应用的需求。

Method: 比较了两种解析器构建方法：监督微调（T5-Small/Base）和少样本上下文学习（GPT-4o/4.1/5），使用图匹配、双向蕴含证明和格式良好性三种评估方式。

Result: 研究发现，在图匹配上表现良好的模型往往无法产生逻辑等价的公式。归一化减少了目标变异性，提高了格式良好性和逻辑充分性。性能随公式复杂度增加而下降，主要错误涉及变量绑定、索引和谓词命名。

Conclusion: 基于图的评估指标在推理导向应用中存在局限性，需要逻辑敏感的评估和训练目标，以及简化、归一化的目标表示。

Abstract: Graph-matching metrics such as Smatch are the de facto standard for
evaluating neural semantic parsers, yet they capture surface overlap rather
than logical equivalence. We reassess evaluation by pairing graph-matching with
automated theorem proving. We compare two approaches to building parsers:
supervised fine-tuning (T5-Small/Base) and few-shot in-context learning
(GPT-4o/4.1/5), under normalized and unnormalized targets. We evaluate outputs
using graph-matching, bidirectional entailment between source and target
formulas with a first-order logic theorem prover, and well-formedness. Across
settings, we find that models performing well on graph-matching often fail to
produce logically equivalent formulas. Normalization reduces incidental target
variability, improves well-formedness, and strengthens logical adequacy. Error
analysis shows performance degrades with increasing formula complexity and with
coordination, prepositional phrases, and passive voice; the dominant failures
involve variable binding and indexing, and predicate naming. These findings
highlight limits of graph-based metrics for reasoning-oriented applications and
motivate logic-sensitive evaluation and training objectives together with
simplified, normalized target representations. All code and data for our
experiments are publicly available.

Conclusion: CNSocialDepress为中文人群心理健康应用提供了有价值的资源，支持抑郁风险识别和心理分析的细粒度、可解释性研究。

Abstract: Depression is a pressing global public health issue, yet publicly available
Chinese-language resources for risk detection remain scarce and are mostly
limited to binary classification. To address this limitation, we release
CNSocialDepress, a benchmark dataset for depression risk detection from Chinese
social media posts. The dataset contains 44,178 texts from 233 users, within
which psychological experts annotated 10,306 depression-related segments.
CNSocialDepress provides binary risk labels together with structured
multi-dimensional psychological attributes, enabling interpretable and
fine-grained analysis of depressive signals. Experimental results demonstrate
its utility across a wide range of NLP tasks, including structured
psychological profiling and fine-tuning of large language models for depression
detection. Comprehensive evaluations highlight the dataset's effectiveness and
practical value for depression risk identification and psychological analysis,
thereby providing insights to mental health applications tailored for
Chinese-speaking populations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: XQuant是一个无需训练、即插即用的框架，通过数据无关校准和跨层KV缓存压缩技术，实现超低等效位宽（低于1.4比特）的KV缓存量化，在保持模型精度的同时显著降低内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理长文本时KV缓存的内存需求巨大，在资源受限环境中部署面临挑战。量化是减少内存消耗同时保留历史信息的有效方法。

Method: 提出XQuant框架，包含两个关键技术：计算量可忽略的数据无关校准方法和跨层KV缓存压缩技术，实现低于1.4比特的超低等效位宽量化。

Result: 在TruthfulQA和LongBench上的实验表明，XQuant在实现更低比特宽度的同时优于现有最佳方法（如KIVI-2bit和AsymKV-1.5bit），在内存效率和模型准确性之间建立了更好的权衡。

Conclusion: XQuant通过创新的量化方法成功解决了LLM部署中的内存瓶颈问题，为资源受限环境中的高效部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse natural language processing tasks. However, their extensive memory
requirements, particularly due to KV cache growth during long-text
understanding and generation, present significant challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Quantization has emerged as a promising
solution to reduce memory consumption while preserving historical information.
We propose XQuant, a training-free and plug-and-play framework that achieves
ultra-low equivalent bit-width KV cache quantization. XQuant introduces two key
innovations: a computationally negligible data-free calibration method and
cross-layer KV cache compression, enabling quantization to sub-1.4 bits.
Extensive experiments on TruthfulQA and LongBench demonstrate that XQuant
outperforms state-of-the-art methods (e.g., KIVI-2bit and AsymKV-1.5bit) by
achieving lower bit-width while maintaining superior performance, establishing
a better trade-off between memory efficiency and model accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御主要关注检测隐藏指令，但对通过内容操纵AI代理的攻击无效。AI代理需要能够批判性评估检索信息，以保护自身和用户免受内容攻击。

Method: 提出将自动事实核查任务重新定位为AI代理的认知自我防御工具，通过外部证据验证主张并评估信息来源可信度。

Result: 论证了内容攻击的有效性，并指出传统防御措施对此类攻击无效。

Conclusion: AI代理需要集成事实核查能力来防御内容攻击，自动事实核查技术可提供有效的认知自我防御机制。

Abstract: When AI agents retrieve and reason over external documents, adversaries can
manipulate the data they receive to subvert their behaviour. Previous research
has studied indirect prompt injection, where the attacker injects malicious
instructions. We argue that injection of instructions is not necessary to
manipulate agents - attackers could instead supply biased, misleading, or false
information. We term this an attack by content. Existing defenses, which focus
on detecting hidden commands, are ineffective against attacks by content. To
defend themselves and their users, agents must critically evaluate retrieved
information, corroborating claims with external evidence and evaluating source
trustworthiness. We argue that this is analogous to an existing NLP task,
automated fact-checking, which we propose to repurpose as a cognitive
self-defense tool for agents.

TL;DR: 评估人类心理测量测试在大语言模型中的可靠性和有效性，发现测试分数与模型在下游任务中的行为不一致，表明生态效度低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理测量测试越来越多地用于评估大语言模型的心理结构，但尚不清楚这些为人类设计的测试在应用于LLMs时是否产生有意义的结果。

Method: 系统评估三个心理结构（性别歧视、种族歧视和道德）的人类心理测量测试的可靠性和有效性，包括收敛效度和生态效度评估。

Result: 发现跨多个项目和提示变体的中等可靠性，但心理测量测试分数与下游任务行为不一致，有时甚至呈负相关。

Conclusion: 在解释心理测量测试分数之前进行系统评估至关重要，为人类设计的心理测量测试不能直接应用于LLMs而无需调整。

Abstract: Psychometric tests are increasingly used to assess psychological constructs
in large language models (LLMs). However, it remains unclear whether these
tests -- originally developed for humans -- yield meaningful results when
applied to LLMs. In this study, we systematically evaluate the reliability and
validity of human psychometric tests for three constructs: sexism, racism, and
morality. We find moderate reliability across multiple item and prompt
variations. Validity is evaluated through both convergent (i.e., testing
theory-based inter-test correlations) and ecological approaches (i.e., testing
the alignment between tests scores and behavior in real-world downstream
tasks). Crucially, we find that psychometric test scores do not align, and in
some cases even negatively correlate with, model behavior in downstream tasks,
indicating low ecological validity. Our results highlight that systematic
evaluations of psychometric tests is essential before interpreting their
scores. They also suggest that psychometric tests designed for humans cannot be
applied directly to LLMs without adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时场景中新兴事件往往缺乏足够证据支持，现有方法严重依赖外部证据，在证据稀缺情况下泛化能力不足。

Method: 采用顺序评估机制：证据评估（仅在证据充分时使用）、推理评估（在LLM可靠性足够时使用）、情感回退（前两者不可靠时使用）。通过指令调优和伪标签提升评估准确性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，显著提升对实时新闻的泛化能力，并发布了RealTimeNews-25新基准数据集。

Conclusion: EASE框架通过评估感知的决策过程有效解决了证据稀缺下的假新闻检测问题，在实时场景中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Fake news detection becomes particularly challenging in real-time scenarios,
where emerging events often lack sufficient supporting evidence. Existing
approaches often rely heavily on external evidence and therefore struggle to
generalize under evidence scarcity. To address this issue, we propose
Evaluation-Aware Selection of Experts (EASE), a novel framework for real-time
fake news detection that dynamically adapts its decision-making process
according to the assessed sufficiency of available evidence. EASE introduces a
sequential evaluation mechanism comprising three independent perspectives: (1)
Evidence-based evaluation, which assesses evidence and incorporates it into
decision-making only when the evidence is sufficiently supportive; (2)
Reasoning-based evaluation, which leverages the world knowledge of large
language models (LLMs) and applies them only when their reliability is
adequately established; and (3) Sentiment-based fallback, which integrates
sentiment cues when neither evidence nor reasoning is reliable. To enhance the
accuracy of evaluation processes, EASE employs instruction tuning with pseudo
labels to guide each evaluator in justifying its perspective-specific knowledge
through interpretable reasoning. Furthermore, the expert modules integrate the
evaluators' justified assessments with the news content to enable
evaluation-aware decision-making, thereby enhancing overall detection accuracy.
Moreover, we introduce RealTimeNews-25, a new benchmark comprising recent news
for evaluating model generalization on emerging news with limited evidence.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that EASE not only achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmarks, but also significantly improves
generalization to real-time news. The code and dataset are available:

TL;DR: 研究发现，在上下文学习（ICL）中也会出现突发性错位（EM）现象，即通过少量窄范围上下文示例就能使前沿模型产生广泛错位的回答，且错位率随示例数量增加而上升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明窄范围微调会导致模型广泛错位，但未探讨上下文学习是否也会产生类似问题。本文旨在验证ICL中是否存在突发性错位现象。

Method: 使用三个数据集和三个前沿模型，通过提供64-256个窄范围上下文示例进行测试，并分析逐步推理过程来探究错位机制。

Result: 在64个示例下，模型产生错位回答的比例为2%-17%；在256个示例下，错位率可达58%。67.5%的错位推理轨迹显示模型通过采用鲁莽或危险的"人设"来合理化有害输出。

Conclusion: 上下文学习同样会导致突发性错位，且错位机制与微调诱导的错位相似，表明这是大语言模型的普遍性问题，需要引起重视。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that narrow finetuning can produce broadly misaligned
LLMs, a phenomenon termed emergent misalignment (EM). While concerning, these
findings were limited to finetuning and activation steering, leaving out
in-context learning (ICL). We therefore ask: does EM emerge in ICL? We find
that it does: across three datasets, three frontier models produce broadly
misaligned responses at rates between 2% and 17% given 64 narrow in-context
examples, and up to 58% with 256 examples. We also examine mechanisms of EM by
eliciting step-by-step reasoning (while leaving in-context examples unchanged).
Manual analysis of the resulting chain-of-thought shows that 67.5% of
misaligned traces explicitly rationalize harmful outputs by adopting a reckless
or dangerous ''persona'', echoing prior results on finetuning-induced EM.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are vital for knowledge-intensive tasks and have shown
promise in reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However,
constructing high-quality KGs remains difficult, requiring accurate information
extraction and structured representations that support interpretability and
downstream utility. Existing LLM-based approaches often focus narrowly on
entity and relation extraction, limiting coverage to sentence-level contexts or
relying on predefined schemas. We propose a hierarchical extraction framework
that organizes information at multiple levels, enabling the creation of
semantically rich and well-structured KGs. Using state-of-the-art LLMs, we
extract and construct knowledge graphs and evaluate them comprehensively from
both structural and semantic perspectives. Our results highlight the strengths
and shortcomings of current LLMs in KG construction and identify key challenges
for future work. To advance research in this area, we also release a curated
dataset of LLM-generated KGs derived from research papers on children's mental
well-being. This resource aims to foster more transparent, reliable, and
impactful applications in high-stakes domains such as healthcare.

Method: 将语言反馈嵌入作为Transformer策略输入序列的一部分，可选地结合传统下一动作预测目标和辅助自监督学习目标进行反馈预测，在BabyAI-XGen环境中测试。

Result: 在具身视觉语言任务中，智能体的组合泛化能力和鲁棒性显著提升，表明该方法能成功将次优行为转化为学习机会。

Abstract: Current approaches to embodied AI tend to learn policies from expert
demonstrations. However, without a mechanism to evaluate the quality of
demonstrated actions, they are limited to learning from optimal behaviour, or
they risk replicating errors and inefficiencies. While reinforcement learning
offers one alternative, the associated exploration typically results in
sacrificing data efficiency. This work explores how agents trained with
imitation learning can learn robust representations from both optimal and
suboptimal demonstrations when given access to constructive language feedback
as a means to contextualise different modes of behaviour. We directly provide
language feedback embeddings as part of the input sequence into a
Transformer-based policy, and optionally complement the traditional next action
prediction objective with auxiliary self-supervised learning objectives for
feedback prediction. We test our approach on a range of embodied
Vision-and-Language tasks in our custom BabyAI-XGen environment and show
significant improvements in agents' compositional generalisation abilities and
robustness, suggesting that our data-efficient method allows models to
successfully convert suboptimal behaviour into learning opportunities. Overall,
our results suggest that language feedback is a competitive and intuitive
alternative to intermediate scalar rewards for language-specified embodied
tasks.

*Belkiss Souayed,Sarah Ebling,Yingqiang Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个结构化视觉语言模型提示框架，用于从简化文本生成可访问图像，通过五种提示模板和专家评估验证了视觉简约性对语言可访问性的提升效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智力障碍人士理解复杂文本的困难，现有文本到图像模型过于注重美观而忽视可访问性，需要探索视觉插图与文本简化之间的关系。

Method: 设计了五种提示模板（基本对象聚焦、上下文场景、教育布局、多级细节、网格布局），使用400个句子级简化文本进行两阶段评估：第一阶段用CLIP分数评估提示模板效果，第二阶段由四位可访问性专家对十种视觉风格进行人工标注。

Result: 基本对象聚焦提示模板实现了最高的语义对齐，表明视觉简约性增强了语言可访问性；复古风格被评为最可访问的视觉风格，维基百科是最有效的数据源；文本简单性维度显示出强可靠性，而图像质量更为主观。

Conclusion: 该框架为可访问内容生成提供了实用指南，强调了结构化提示在AI生成视觉可访问性工具中的重要性。

Abstract: Individuals with intellectual disabilities often have difficulties in
comprehending complex texts. While many text-to-image models prioritize
aesthetics over accessibility, it is not clear how visual illustrations relate
to text simplifications (TS) generated from them. This paper presents a
structured vision-language model (VLM) prompting framework for generating
accessible images from simplified texts. We designed five prompt templates,
i.e., Basic Object Focus, Contextual Scene, Educational Layout, Multi-Level
Detail, and Grid Layout, each following distinct spatial arrangements while
adhering to accessibility constraints such as object count limits, spatial
separation, and content restrictions. Using 400 sentence-level simplifications
from four established TS datasets (OneStopEnglish, SimPA, Wikipedia, and
ASSET), we conducted a two-phase evaluation: Phase 1 assessed prompt template
effectiveness with CLIPScores, and Phase 2 involved human annotation of
generated images across ten visual styles by four accessibility experts.
Results show that the Basic Object Focus prompt template achieved the highest
semantic alignment, indicating that visual minimalism enhances language
accessibility. Expert evaluation further identified Retro style as the most
accessible and Wikipedia as the most effective data source. Inter-annotator
agreement varied across dimensions, with Text Simplicity showing strong
reliability and Image Quality proving more subjective. Overall, our framework
offers practical guidelines for accessible content generation and underscores
the importance of structured prompting in AI-generated visual accessibility
tools.

TL;DR: 该研究发现了大语言模型中的情感电路机制，通过调控这些电路可以实现99.65%的情感表达准确率，超越了基于提示和引导的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型对情感智能需求的增长，需要理解情感表达的内部机制并控制生成文本中的情感。

Method: 构建SEV数据集，提取上下文无关的情感方向，通过分析分解和因果分析识别神经元和注意力头，量化各子层对情感表示的因果影响，整合局部组件形成全局情感电路。

Result: 发现了跨上下文一致编码情感的情感方向，识别了实现情感计算的局部组件，通过调控情感电路实现了99.65%的情感表达准确率。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统发现和验证大语言模型中情感电路的研究，为可解释性和可控情感智能提供了新见解。

Abstract: As the demand for emotional intelligence in large language models (LLMs)
grows, a key challenge lies in understanding the internal mechanisms that give
rise to emotional expression and in controlling emotions in generated text.
This study addresses three core questions: (1) Do LLMs contain context-agnostic
mechanisms shaping emotional expression? (2) What form do these mechanisms
take? (3) Can they be harnessed for universal emotion control? We first
construct a controlled dataset, SEV (Scenario-Event with Valence), to elicit
comparable internal states across emotions. Subsequently, we extract
context-agnostic emotion directions that reveal consistent, cross-context
encoding of emotion (Q1). We identify neurons and attention heads that locally
implement emotional computation through analytical decomposition and causal
analysis, and validate their causal roles via ablation and enhancement
interventions. Next, we quantify each sublayer's causal influence on the
model's final emotion representation and integrate the identified local
components into coherent global emotion circuits that drive emotional
expression (Q2). Directly modulating these circuits achieves 99.65%
emotion-expression accuracy on the test set, surpassing prompting- and
steering-based methods (Q3). To our knowledge, this is the first systematic
study to uncover and validate emotion circuits in LLMs, offering new insights
into interpretability and controllable emotional intelligence.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了LLM特定效用的概念，发现不同LLM对相同段落的效用不同，人类标注的段落对特定LLM并非最优，且效用段落在不同LLM间不可迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索增强生成(RAG)只关注相关性，但RAG的有效性取决于检索段落的效用。现有研究将效用视为通用属性，忽略了不同LLM因内部知识和理解能力差异而对相同段落受益不同的情况。

Method: 通过多数据集和LLM的大规模实验，研究LLM特定效用，并基于困惑度等指标分析查询和段落的可读性差异。提出LLM特定效用判断的基准评估流程。

Result: 实验表明人类标注的段落对特定LLM并非最优，真实效用段落在不同LLM间不可迁移。现有效用判断方法中，基于伪答案的言语化方法表现稳健，但LLM在效用评估方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在RAG研究中采用LLM特定效用的必要性，并为LLM特定效用判断提供了基准评估方法。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
incorporating external knowledge. While traditional retrieval focuses on
relevance, RAG's effectiveness depends on the utility of retrieved passages,
i.e., the usefulness in facilitating the generation of an accurate and
comprehensive answer. Existing studies often treat utility as a generic
attribute, ignoring the fact that different LLMs may benefit differently from
the same passage due to variations in internal knowledge and comprehension
ability. In this work, we introduce and systematically investigate the notion
of LLM-specific utility. Through large-scale experiments across multiple
datasets and LLMs, we demonstrate that human-annotated passages are not optimal
for LLMs and that ground-truth utilitarian passages are not transferable across
different LLMs. These findings highlight the necessity of adopting the
LLM-specific utility in RAG research. Our findings indicate that some
human-annotated passages are not ground-truth utilitarian passages for specific
LLMs, partially due to the varying readability of queries and passages for
LLMs, a tendency for which perplexity is a key metric. Based on these findings,
we propose a benchmarking procedure for LLM-specific utility judgments. We
evaluate existing utility judgment methods on six datasets and find that while
verbalized methods using pseudo-answers perform robustly, LLMs struggle to
assess utility effectively-failing to reject all passages for known queries and
to select truly useful ones for unknown queries.

TL;DR: 提出了Rollout Routing Replay (R3)方法来解决MoE模型在强化学习训练中的路由不稳定性问题，通过记录推理阶段的路由分布并在训练时重放，显著降低了训练-推理策略差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型中的路由机制在强化学习训练中会引入不稳定性，甚至导致灾难性的训练崩溃。研究发现训练和推理阶段存在显著的路由行为差异，即使相同条件下路由框架也会产生不同的专家选择。

Method: 提出R3方法：记录推理引擎的路由分布，在训练阶段重放这些分布，从而减少训练-推理策略的KL散度，缓解极端差异，同时不牺牲训练速度。

Result: 在各种设置下的广泛实验证实，R3成功稳定了RL训练，防止了崩溃，并且在性能上超过了GSPO和TIS等方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为稳定MoE模型中的强化学习训练提供了一个新的解决方案，通过解决路由不一致性问题实现了更稳定的训练过程。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a crucial approach for enhancing
the capabilities of large language models. However, in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
models, the routing mechanism often introduces instability, even leading to
catastrophic RL training collapse. We analyze the training-inference
consistency of MoE models and identify a notable discrepancy in routing
behaviors between the two phases. Moreover, even under identical conditions,
the routing framework can yield divergent expert selections across repeated
forward passes. To address this foundational inconsistency, we propose Rollout
Routing Replay (R3), a method that records routing distributions from the
inference engine and replays them during training. R3 significantly reduces
training-inference policy KL divergence and mitigates extreme discrepancies
without compromising training speed. Extensive experiments on various settings
confirm that R3 succeeds in stabilizing RL training, preventing collapse and
outperforming methods such as GSPO and TIS. We believe this work can offer a
new solution for stabilizing RL in MoE models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型会记忆训练数据，从而暴露私有或受版权保护的文本。现有防御方法主要针对预训练阶段，而对微调过程中的记忆现象了解不足。

Method: 在Pythia、Llama3和Mistral模型上进行微调实验，跟踪逐字记忆现象。提出n-gram记忆评分作为早期停止准则，并引入n-gram感知的损失正则化器。

Result: 记忆现象在前几个epoch中急剧增加，通常远早于验证困惑度或评估性能达到最优。提出的方法可减少高达40%的记忆，且性能损失最小。

Conclusion: 这些结果为语言模型微调过程中的记忆动态提供了实用且可扩展的见解，提出的方法能有效缓解记忆问题。

Abstract: Although large language models excel across many tasks, they can memorise
training data and thereby expose private or copyrighted text. Most defences
target the pre-training stage, leaving memorisation during fine-tuning,
especially for domain adaptation and instruction tuning, poorly understood. We
fine-tune Pythia, Llama3, and Mistral models spanning 1.4B-70B parameters on
common evaluation datasets and track verbatim memorisation throughout training.
We find that memorisation increases dramatically in the first few epochs, often
significantly before either validation perplexity or evaluation performance is
optimised. We use a simple but effective n-gram memorisation score which
reliably precedes verbatim memorisation; using it as an early-stopping
criterion mitigates memorisation with minimal performance loss. Further, we
introduce an n-gram-aware loss regulariser and show that it reduces
memorisation across all model families tested by up to 40% while minimising
evaluation performance trade-offs when compared to an existing memorisation
mitigation strategy. These results yield practical, scalable insights into
memorisation dynamics during language model fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将社交推理游戏简化为LLM自博弈，忽略了社交游戏的丰富性，且缺乏质量参考数据和精细评估方法。

Method: 构建包含100+小时视频、32.4M话语标记和15种规则变体的数据集，提出两阶段策略对齐评估：话语评估（多选择任务）和决策评估（投票选择和角色推断）。

Result: 实验显示最先进的LLM表现各异，约半数模型得分低于0.50，在欺骗和反事实推理方面存在明显差距。

Conclusion: 该数据集和评估框架为多智能体交互中的语言、推理和策略研究提供了新的基准和启发。

Abstract: Social deduction games like Werewolf combine language, reasoning, and
strategy, providing a testbed for studying natural language and social
intelligence. However, most studies reduce the game to LLM-based self-play,
yielding templated utterances and anecdotal cases that overlook the richness of
social gameplay. Evaluation further relies on coarse metrics such as survival
time or subjective scoring due to the lack of quality reference data. To
address these gaps, we curate a high-quality, human-verified multimodal
Werewolf dataset containing over 100 hours of video, 32.4M utterance tokens,
and 15 rule variants. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel
strategy-alignment evaluation that leverages the winning faction's strategies
as ground truth in two stages: 1) Speech evaluation, formulated as
multiple-choice-style tasks that assess whether the model can adopt appropriate
stances across five dimensions of social ability; and 2) Decision evaluation,
which assesses the model's voting choices and opponent-role inferences. This
framework enables a fine-grained evaluation of models' linguistic and reasoning
capabilities, while capturing their ability to generate strategically coherent
gameplay. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs show diverse
performance, with roughly half remain below 0.50, revealing clear gaps in
deception and counterfactual reasoning. We hope our dataset further inspires
research on language, reasoning, and strategy in multi-agent interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最好的LLM在超过五分之一的情况下会错误判断自身能力，导致基于这种内部不确定性的响应不可信。需要让AI知道它知道什么以及什么时候不知道。

Method: 结合两个组件：(1)自省：模型生成并分类其判断为可行或不可行的任务；(2)基于共识的奖励：通过内部一致性来强化自我认知评估的稳定性。

Result: 在LLaMA-3.1-8B和Qwen-2.5-7B上的实验显示，KnowRL显著提升了自我认知能力，准确率提升高达28%，F1分数提升12%，仅需少量种子集且无需外部监督。

Conclusion: 该框架解锁了LLM自我提升知识认知的潜力，为构建更可靠、更负责任的AI以及在关键应用中更安全部署打开了大门。

Abstract: Truly reliable AI requires more than simply scaling up knowledge; it demands
the ability to know what it knows and when it does not. Yet recent research
shows that even the best LLMs misjudge their own competence in more than one in
five cases, making any response born of such internal uncertainty impossible to
fully trust. Inspired by self-improvement reinforcement learning techniques
that require minimal data, we present a simple but powerful framework KnowRL
that strengthens a model's internal understanding of its own feasibility
boundaries, enabling safer and more responsible behaviour. Our framework
combines two components: (i) introspection, where the model generates and
classifies tasks it judges feasible or infeasible, and (ii) consensus-based
rewarding, where stability of self-knowledge assessment is reinforced through
internal agreement. By using internally generated data, this design strengthens
consistency in self-knowledge and entirely avoids costly external supervision.
In experiments on LLaMA-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B, KnowRL steadily improved
self-knowledge, validated by both intrinsic self-consistency and extrinsic
benchmarking. With nothing more than a small seed set and no external
supervision, our method drove gains as high as 28% in accuracy and 12% in F1,
outperforming baselines in just a few iterations. Our framework essentially
unlocks the untapped capacity of LLMs to self-improve their knowledge
awareness, opening the door to reliable, more accountable AI and safer
deployment in critical applications. Owing to its simplicity and independence
from external effort, we encourage applying this reliability-enhancing process
to all future models.

TL;DR: 研究发现，单独使用LLM生成调查回复会引入显著偏差(24-86%)，但结合纠偏方法能将偏差降至5%以下，并将有效样本量提升达14%。在固定预算下，将更多人类回复分配给纠偏而非微调，能实现更有效的估计。

Motivation: 传统调查成本高且执行慢，LLM被提议作为可扩展、低成本的人类受访者替代方案，但其输出存在偏差且估计无效。

Method: 研究合成方法(使用LLM生成调查回复)与纠偏方法(消除人口估计偏差)的相互作用，探索如何最佳分配人类回复在这两种方法之间。使用两个关于营养、政治和经济问题的面板调查。

Result: 合成方法单独使用时引入24-86%的偏差，但结合纠偏方法后偏差降至5%以下，有效样本量增加达14%。

Conclusion: 挑战了将所有人类回复用于微调的常见做法，证明在固定预算下，将大部分人类回复分配给纠偏能实现更有效的估计。

Abstract: Surveys provide valuable insights into public opinion and behavior, but their
execution is costly and slow. Large language models (LLMs) have been proposed
as a scalable, low-cost substitute for human respondents, but their outputs are
often biased and yield invalid estimates. We study the interplay between
synthesis methods that use LLMs to generate survey responses and rectification
methods that debias population estimates, and explore how human responses are
best allocated between them. Using two panel surveys with questions on
nutrition, politics, and economics, we find that synthesis alone introduces
substantial bias (24-86%), whereas combining it with rectification reduces bias
below 5% and increases effective sample size by up to 14%. Overall, we
challenge the common practice of using all human responses for fine-tuning,
showing that under a fixed budget, allocating most to rectification results in
far more effective estimation.

Abstract: Generative large language models (LLMs) have become central to everyday life,
producing human-like text across diverse domains. A growing body of research
investigates whether these models also exhibit personality- and
demographic-like characteristics in their language. In this work, we introduce
a novel, data-driven methodology for assessing LLM personality without relying
on self-report questionnaires, applying instead automatic personality and
gender classifiers to model replies on open-ended questions collected from
Reddit. Comparing six widely used models to human-authored responses, we find
that LLMs systematically express higher Agreeableness and lower Neuroticism,
reflecting cooperative and stable conversational tendencies. Gendered language
patterns in model text broadly resemble those of human writers, though with
reduced variation, echoing prior findings on automated agents. We contribute a
new dataset of human and model responses, along with large-scale comparative
analyses, shedding new light on the topic of personality and demographic
patterns of generative AI.

Motivation: 现实场景中实体类别持续增加，现有持续学习方法在NER任务中面临灾难性遗忘和非实体类型语义偏移的挑战。

Method: 将CNER任务转换为持续实体三元组序列生成问题，使用预训练seq2seq模型，结合类型特定置信度伪标签策略和知识蒸馏技术。

Conclusion: GenCNER是一个简单但有效的生成式框架，能够有效缓解CNER中的灾难性遗忘和语义偏移问题。

Abstract: Traditional named entity recognition (NER) aims to identify text mentions
into pre-defined entity types. Continual Named Entity Recognition (CNER) is
introduced since entity categories are continuously increasing in various
real-world scenarios. However, existing continual learning (CL) methods for NER
face challenges of catastrophic forgetting and semantic shift of non-entity
type. In this paper, we propose GenCNER, a simple but effective Generative
framework for CNER to mitigate the above drawbacks. Specifically, we skillfully
convert the CNER task into sustained entity triplet sequence generation problem
and utilize a powerful pre-trained seq2seq model to solve it. Additionally, we
design a type-specific confidence-based pseudo labeling strategy along with
knowledge distillation (KD) to preserve learned knowledge and alleviate the
impact of label noise at the triplet level. Experimental results on two
benchmark datasets show that our framework outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods in multiple CNER settings, and achieves the smallest
gap compared with non-CL results.

Motivation: 传统文本预处理方法（如停用词去除、词形还原和词干提取）通常忽略上下文信息，而大型语言模型能够考虑上下文且不需要大量语言特定的标注资源

Method: 使用LLM执行多种预处理任务（停用词去除、词形还原和词干提取），并在六种欧洲语言的网络数据上进行综合评估，与传统算法在多个文本分类任务中比较

Result: LLM能够以97%、82%和74%的准确率分别复制传统的停用词去除、词形还原和词干提取方法；使用LLM预处理的文本训练的机器学习算法在F1分数上相比传统技术提升高达6%

Conclusion: LLM在文本预处理任务中表现出色，能够有效考虑上下文信息，在多种语言上超越传统预处理方法

Abstract: Text preprocessing is a fundamental component of Natural Language Processing,
involving techniques such as stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization to
prepare text as input for further processing and analysis. Despite the
context-dependent nature of the above techniques, traditional methods usually
ignore contextual information. In this paper, we investigate the idea of using
Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform various preprocessing tasks, due to
their ability to take context into account without requiring extensive
language-specific annotated resources. Through a comprehensive evaluation on
web-sourced data, we compare LLM-based preprocessing (specifically stopword
removal, lemmatization and stemming) to traditional algorithms across multiple
text classification tasks in six European languages. Our analysis indicates
that LLMs are capable of replicating traditional stopword removal,
lemmatization, and stemming methods with accuracies reaching 97%, 82%, and 74%,
respectively. Additionally, we show that ML algorithms trained on texts
preprocessed by LLMs achieve an improvement of up to 6% with respect to the
$F_1$ measure compared to traditional techniques. Our code, prompts, and

Motivation: 现有LLM幻觉检测方法存在"检测困境"：内部状态探测擅长检测事实不一致但无法处理逻辑谬误，而思维链验证则相反。这种分裂导致在不同任务类型中存在盲点。

Method: 引入多路径推理机制获取更可比较的细粒度信号，以及分段感知时序交叉注意力模块来自适应融合对齐后的表示，从而精确定位细微的不一致。

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架成功解决了LLM幻觉检测中的关键挑战，通过克服信号稀缺和表示对齐障碍，实现了更全面和有效的幻觉检测。

Abstract: The detection of sophisticated hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs)
is hampered by a ``Detection Dilemma'': methods probing internal states
(Internal State Probing) excel at identifying factual inconsistencies but fail
on logical fallacies, while those verifying externalized reasoning
(Chain-of-Thought Verification) show the opposite behavior. This schism creates
a task-dependent blind spot: Chain-of-Thought Verification fails on
fact-intensive tasks like open-domain QA where reasoning is ungrounded, while
Internal State Probing is ineffective on logic-intensive tasks like
mathematical reasoning where models are confidently wrong. We resolve this with
a unified framework that bridges this critical gap. However, unification is
hindered by two fundamental challenges: the Signal Scarcity Barrier, as coarse
symbolic reasoning chains lack signals directly comparable to fine-grained
internal states, and the Representational Alignment Barrier, a deep-seated
mismatch between their underlying semantic spaces. To overcome these, we
introduce a multi-path reasoning mechanism to obtain more comparable,
fine-grained signals, and a segment-aware temporalized cross-attention module
to adaptively fuse these now-aligned representations, pinpointing subtle
dissonances. Extensive experiments on three diverse benchmarks and two leading
LLMs demonstrate that our framework consistently and significantly outperforms
strong baselines. Our code is available: https://github.com/peach918/HalluDet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有序列标记方法主要依赖顺序上下文，难以捕捉丰富的标记间依赖关系。需要结合预训练语义特征和图关系建模来提升标记分类性能。

Method: 构建基于PhoBERT标记嵌入的完全连接图，使用图注意力网络捕捉标记间依赖，再应用Transformer自注意力层增强上下文表示，最后通过分类头进行序列标记。

Result: 在PhoNER-COVID19、PhoDisfluency和VietMed-NER三个越南语数据集上均优于基线模型，包括仅Transformer模型和BiLSTM+CNN+CRF混合模型。

Conclusion: 结合预训练语义特征和图关系建模能有效提升跨多个领域的标记分类性能，图注意力网络能捕捉超越顺序上下文的丰富标记依赖关系。

Abstract: We propose a novel neural architecture named TextGraphFuseGAT, which
integrates a pretrained transformer encoder (PhoBERT) with Graph Attention
Networks for token-level classification tasks. The proposed model constructs a
fully connected graph over the token embeddings produced by PhoBERT, enabling
the GAT layer to capture rich inter-token dependencies beyond those modeled by
sequential context alone. To further enhance contextualization, a
Transformer-style self-attention layer is applied on top of the graph-enhanced
embeddings. The final token representations are passed through a classification
head to perform sequence labeling. We evaluate our approach on three Vietnamese
benchmark datasets: PhoNER-COVID19 for named entity recognition in the COVID-19
domain, PhoDisfluency for speech disfluency detection, and VietMed-NER for
medical-domain NER. VietMed-NER is the first Vietnamese medical spoken NER
dataset, featuring 18 entity types collected from real-world medical speech
transcripts and annotated with the BIO tagging scheme. Its specialized
vocabulary and domain-specific expressions make it a challenging benchmark for
token-level classification models. Experimental results show that our method
consistently outperforms strong baselines, including transformer-only and
hybrid neural models such as BiLSTM + CNN + CRF, confirming the effectiveness
of combining pretrained semantic features with graph-based relational modeling
for improved token classification across multiple domains.

### [362] [Information-Preserving Reformulation of Reasoning Traces for Antidistillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11545)
*Jiayu Ding,Lei Cui,Li Dong,Nanning Zheng,Furu Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PART是一种保护推理过程免受未经授权蒸馏的信息保留方法，通过移除自对话行为和重排子结论来扰乱蒸馏过程，同时保持人类可读性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM展示详细推理链能提升性能但易被蒸馏窃取，而过度保护又会剥夺用户有价值的中间信息，需要平衡保护与可用性。

Method: 设计两步重构：移除自对话行为、重排子结论，使用小型辅助模型执行重构，计算开销极小。

Result: PART能持续扰乱不同规模和类型学生模型的蒸馏，在AIME 2024上使32B模型性能从54.17降至46.88，下降13.5%。

Conclusion: PART有效解决了推理链保护与信息保留的权衡问题，为模型提供商提供了实用的防蒸馏解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) show that extending the
length of reasoning chains significantly improves performance on complex tasks.
While revealing these reasoning traces helps users better follow, verify, and
learn from the model's problem-solving process, it also makes them highly
vulnerable to unauthorized distillation. To mitigate this risk, proprietary
model providers often adopt aggressive protection strategies, such as replacing
detailed reasoning with brief summaries, which deprive users of valuable
intermediate information. To address this trade-off, we propose PART, an
information-preserving antidistillation reformulation of reasoning traces.
Motivated by the difference between how humans understand reasoning traces and
how LLMs exploit them for supervised fine-tuning, we design a simple but
effective two-step reformulation: removing self-talk behaviors and reordering
sub-conclusions. A small auxiliary model is trained to perform this
reformulation, incurring minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PART consistently disrupts distillation across student models
of different sizes and types on various reasoning benchmarks. For instance,
when training on reformulated traces, even the performance of a large 32B
student model decreases from 54.17 to 46.88 on AIME 2024, corresponding to a
13.5% degradation.

*Saurabh Khanna,Xinxu Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个连接语言活力、数字存在与后殖民理论的框架，揭示了AI系统中语言不平等不是偶然而是结构性的问题，识别出四种语言类别，其中27%的语言虽拥有数百万使用者但在数字生态中几乎不可见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在大量多语言语料上训练，但全球7613种现存语言中约2000种语言在数字生态系统中几乎不可见，这反映了结构性不平等问题。

Method: 分析所有有记录的人类语言数据，将语言活力（现实世界人口强度）和数字性（在线存在）与后殖民理论和认知不公正理论相结合，识别出四种语言类别。

Result: 识别出四种语言类别：堡垒语言（33%，高活力和数字性）、数字回声（6%，数字性高但活力下降）、消逝之声（36%，两方面都低）和关键的无形巨人（27%，高活力但数字性接近零）。

Conclusion: AI中的英语主导不是技术必然，而是系统性排斥边缘化语言知识的权力结构的产物，需要去殖民化语言技术并民主化AI利益获取。

Abstract: Large Language Models are trained on massive multilingual corpora, yet this
abundance masks a profound crisis: of the world's 7,613 living languages,
approximately 2,000 languages with millions of speakers remain effectively
invisible in digital ecosystems. We propose a critical framework connecting
empirical measurements of language vitality (real world demographic strength)
and digitality (online presence) with postcolonial theory and epistemic
injustice to explain why linguistic inequality in AI systems is not incidental
but structural. Analyzing data across all documented human languages, we
identify four categories: Strongholds (33%, high vitality and digitality),
Digital Echoes (6%, high digitality despite declining vitality), Fading Voices
(36%, low on both dimensions), and critically, Invisible Giants (27%, high
vitality but near-zero digitality) - languages spoken by millions yet absent
from the LLM universe. We demonstrate that these patterns reflect continuities
from colonial-era linguistic hierarchies to contemporary AI development,
constituting what we term digital epistemic injustice. Our analysis reveals
that English dominance in AI is not a technical necessity but an artifact of
power structures that systematically exclude marginalized linguistic knowledge.
We conclude with implications for decolonizing language technology and
democratizing access to AI benefits.

TL;DR: 提出了首个评估LLMs在多元文化对话场景中文化适应能力的框架和基准，发现现有模型在对话式文化适应方面存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有衡量LLMs文化适应能力的基准与模型在实际多元文化用户交互中面临的挑战不匹配，需要更真实的评估方法。

Method: 基于社会文化理论构建框架，将语言风格作为文化沟通的关键要素，创建由多元文化评分者标注的基准数据集，并提出跨文化评估的新标准。

Result: 评估当前顶级LLMs发现，这些模型在对话场景中的文化适应能力表现不佳。

Conclusion: 需要开发更有效的文化适应能力评估方法，以更好地支持LLMs在多元文化环境中的应用。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks that measure cultural adaptation in LLMs are misaligned
with the actual challenges these models face when interacting with users from
diverse cultural backgrounds. In this work, we introduce the first framework
and benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic, multicultural
conversational settings. Grounded in sociocultural theory, our framework
formalizes how linguistic style - a key element of cultural communication - is
shaped by situational, relational, and cultural context. We construct a
benchmark dataset based on this framework, annotated by culturally diverse
raters, and propose a new set of desiderata for cross-cultural evaluation in
NLP: conversational framing, stylistic sensitivity, and subjective correctness.
We evaluate today's top LLMs on our benchmark and show that these models
struggle with cultural adaptation in a conversational setting.

Conclusion: LLMAtKGE框架能有效进行对抗攻击并生成可读解释，通过消融和案例研究验证了其解释生成能力。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on knowledge graph embeddings (KGE) aim to disrupt the
model's ability of link prediction by removing or inserting triples. A recent
black-box method has attempted to incorporate textual and structural
information to enhance attack performance. However, it is unable to generate
human-readable explanations, and exhibits poor generalizability. In the past
few years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities
in text comprehension, generation, and reasoning. In this paper, we propose
LLMAtKGE, a novel LLM-based framework that selects attack targets and generates
human-readable explanations. To provide the LLM with sufficient factual context
under limited input constraints, we design a structured prompting scheme that
explicitly formulates the attack as multiple-choice questions while
incorporating KG factual evidence. To address the context-window limitation and
hesitation issues, we introduce semantics-based and centrality-based filters,
which compress the candidate set while preserving high recall of
attack-relevant information. Furthermore, to efficiently integrate both
semantic and structural information into the filter, we precompute high-order
adjacency and fine-tune the LLM with a triple classification task to enhance
filtering performance. Experiments on two widely used knowledge graph datasets
demonstrate that our attack outperforms the strongest black-box baselines and
provides explanations via reasoning, and showing competitive performance
compared with white-box methods. Comprehensive ablation and case studies
further validate its capability to generate explanations.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM生成开放式文本，但封闭式调查响应的生成方法缺乏标准实践，需要系统评估不同方法对预测调查响应的影响。

Method: 使用8种调查响应生成方法、4个政治态度调查和10个开源语言模型，生成了3200万个模拟调查响应，比较不同方法在个体层面和子群体层面的对齐效果。

Result: 不同调查响应生成方法之间存在显著差异，限制性生成方法总体表现最佳，推理输出不能持续改善对齐效果。

Conclusion: 调查响应生成方法对模拟调查响应有显著影响，研究提出了应用这些方法的实用建议。

Abstract: Many in-silico simulations of human survey responses with large language
models (LLMs) focus on generating closed-ended survey responses, whereas LLMs
are typically trained to generate open-ended text instead. Previous research
has used a diverse range of methods for generating closed-ended survey
responses with LLMs, and a standard practice remains to be identified. In this
paper, we systematically investigate the impact that various Survey Response
Generation Methods have on predicted survey responses. We present the results
of 32 mio. simulated survey responses across 8 Survey Response Generation
Methods, 4 political attitude surveys, and 10 open-weight language models. We
find significant differences between the Survey Response Generation Methods in
both individual-level and subpopulation-level alignment. Our results show that
Restricted Generation Methods perform best overall, and that reasoning output
does not consistently improve alignment. Our work underlines the significant
impact that Survey Response Generation Methods have on simulated survey
responses, and we develop practical recommendations on the application of
Survey Response Generation Methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MeTA-LoRA是一个两阶段优化框架，通过少量样本学习任务特定LoRA适配器，然后聚合多任务梯度更新共享适配器，显著提高了多任务适应的数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA在单任务设置中表现优异，但在多任务学习场景中难以有效利用任务间知识，通常需要大量任务特定数据才能达到最优性能。

Method: 采用两阶段优化：第一阶段使用少量样本学习任务特定LoRA适配器；第二阶段通过聚合多任务梯度更新共享LoRA适配器，促进跨任务知识迁移。

Result: 在多任务学习和多语言学习场景中，该方法匹配或超越了传统全数据LoRA微调方法的性能，同时显著减少了任务特定数据的使用量。

Conclusion: MeTA-LoRA框架有效解决了LoRA在多任务学习中的数据效率问题，实现了在减少数据使用的同时保持或提升性能的目标。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely used
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods for adapting large language
models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. While highly effective in single-task
settings, it struggles to efficiently leverage inter-task knowledge in complex
multi-task learning scenarios, often requiring substantial task-specific data
to achieve optimal performance. To address this limitation, we introduce
MeTA-LoRA, a two-stage optimization framework that significantly improves data
efficiency in multi-task adaptation. In the first stage, task-specific LoRA
adapters are learned using only a few samples from each involved dataset,
enabling rapid adaptation without large-scale supervision. In the second stage,
the shared LoRA adapter is updated by aggregating gradients from multiple tasks
to promote knowledge transfer across tasks, further reducing data usage by
leveraging common patterns. In both multi-task learning and multilingual
learning scenarios, our method matches or surpasses the performance of
traditional full-data LoRA fine-tuning approaches, while using significantly
less task-specific data.

TL;DR: 提出SemCSE-Multi框架，用于生成科学摘要的多方面嵌入表示，支持细粒度相似度评估和自适应可视化，并通过解码机制提高可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学摘要嵌入方法通常生成单一表示，无法捕捉不同方面的语义信息，限制了细粒度分析和用户驱动的可视化需求。

Method: 采用无监督方法生成方面特定的摘要句子，训练嵌入模型将语义相关的摘要映射到嵌入空间相近位置，然后蒸馏到统一模型中实现单次前向预测多个方面嵌入。

Result: 在入侵生物学和医学领域验证了框架有效性，能够生成多方面嵌入并支持解码回自然语言描述，即使在低维可视化的未占据区域也保持解码效果。

Conclusion: SemCSE-Multi框架实现了科学摘要的多方面嵌入表示，提供了可控的相似度评估和可解释的可视化能力，为科学领域分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: We propose SemCSE-Multi, a novel unsupervised framework for generating
multifaceted embeddings of scientific abstracts, evaluated in the domains of
invasion biology and medicine. These embeddings capture distinct, individually
specifiable aspects in isolation, thus enabling fine-grained and controllable
similarity assessments as well as adaptive, user-driven visualizations of
scientific domains. Our approach relies on an unsupervised procedure that
produces aspect-specific summarizing sentences and trains embedding models to
map semantically related summaries to nearby positions in the embedding space.
We then distill these aspect-specific embedding capabilities into a unified
embedding model that directly predicts multiple aspect embeddings from a
scientific abstract in a single, efficient forward pass. In addition, we
introduce an embedding decoding pipeline that decodes embeddings back into
natural language descriptions of their associated aspects. Notably, we show
that this decoding remains effective even for unoccupied regions in
low-dimensional visualizations, thus offering vastly improved interpretability
in user-centric settings.

*Huiyin Xue,Nafise Sadat Moosavi,Nikolaos Aletras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统解构了Transformer注意力机制，发现跨位置信息混合是必需的，而数学形式和序列依赖性可以大幅简化，特别是在部分层保留标准注意力的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer语言模型的成功归功于点积注意力机制，但该机制包含的多个设计原则（跨位置信息混合、序列依赖激活、特定数学形式、查询键与隐藏状态耦合）的必要性尚未得到充分测试。

Method: 设计受控变体，选择性地放松注意力机制的不同原则，包括在所有层统一应用和在混合架构中仅部分层保留标准注意力。

Result: 跨位置信息混合机制不可或缺，其缺失会导致模型性能接近随机；而数学形式和序列依赖性可以大幅简化，特别是在部分层保留标准注意力时。令人惊讶的是，单独失败的变体在与标准注意力交错使用时也能获得稳健性能。

Conclusion: 这些发现深化了对注意力机制有效性的理解，为简化语言模型而不牺牲性能开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The success of Transformer language models is widely credited to their
dot-product attention mechanism, which interweaves a set of key design
principles: mixing information across positions (enabling multi-token
interactions), sequence-dependent activations (where attention weights adapt to
each input), a specific mathematical form (dot-product similarities plus
softmax weighting), and coupling of queries and keys to evolving hidden states
(grounding attention in the current layer). However, the necessity of each of
these principles remains largely untested. In this work, we systematically
deconstruct attention by designing controlled variants that selectively relax
these principles, applied both uniformly across all layers and in hybrid
architectures where only some layers retain standard attention. Our empirical
analysis reveals that mechanisms for mixing tokens are indispensable, as their
absence collapses models to near-random behavior, while the exact mathematical
form and sequence dependency can be substantially relaxed, especially when
preserved in just a subset of layers. Surprisingly, even variants that fail in
isolation can achieve robust performance when interleaved with standard
attention, highlighting a cooperative effect. These findings deepen our
understanding of what truly underpins attention's effectiveness and open new
avenues for simplifying language models without sacrificing performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于logit的知识蒸馏方法采用静态策略，对所有token不加区分地使用固定温度，导致知识转移效果不佳，无法适应学生模型的动态学习过程。

Method: AdaKD包含两个协同模块：1）损失驱动的自适应token聚焦模块，根据学生学习稳定性动态调整蒸馏重点；2）逆难度温度缩放策略，对困难token使用低温进行针对性纠错，对简单token使用高温鼓励学习教师完整平滑的输出分布。

Result: AdaKD作为即插即用框架，能够在多种模型架构和基准测试中持续提升各种蒸馏方法的性能。

Conclusion: AdaKD通过动态适应token学习状态的知识蒸馏方法，有效提升了知识转移效果，为语言模型压缩提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a key technique for compressing large-scale
language models (LLMs), yet prevailing logit-based methods typically employ
static strategies that are misaligned with the dynamic learning process of
student models. These methods typically treat all tokens indiscriminately and
apply a single, fixed temperature, resulting in suboptimal knowledge transfer.
To address these limitations, we propose LLM-Oriented Token-Adaptive Knowledge
Distillation (AdaKD), a novel framework that adapts the distillation process to
the real-time learning state of each token. AdaKD consists of two synergistic
modules driven by a unified token difficulty metric. First, our Loss-Driven
Adaptive Token Focusing (LATF) module dynamically adjusts the distillation
focus by monitoring the student's learning stability, concentrating
computational resources on the most valuable tokens at each training phase.
Second, we introduce Inverse Difficulty Temperature Scaling (IDTS), a
counterintuitive yet effective token-level temperature strategy. It employs low
temperatures for difficult tokens for targeted error correction, and high
temperatures for easy tokens to encourage students to learn from the teacher's
complete and smooth output distribution, thereby enhancing generalization. As a
plug-and-play framework, AdaKD can consistently improve the performance of
various distillation methods on multiple model architectures and benchmarks.

Conclusion: 这种方法为创建动态、沉浸式的长篇小说提供了可扩展和创新的解决方案，故事从智能体驱动的互动中有机演化。

Abstract: Human writers often begin their stories with an overarching mental scene,
where they envision the interactions between characters and their environment.
Inspired by this creative process, we propose a novel approach to long-form
story generation, termed hybrid bottom-up long-form story generation, using
multi-agent simulations. In our method, agents interact within a dynamic
sandbox environment, where their behaviors and interactions with one another
and the environment generate emergent events. These events form the foundation
for the story, enabling organic character development and plot progression.
Unlike traditional top-down approaches that impose rigid structures, our hybrid
bottom-up approach allows for the natural unfolding of events, fostering more
spontaneous and engaging storytelling. The system is capable of generating
stories exceeding 10,000 words while maintaining coherence and consistency,
addressing some of the key challenges faced by current story generation models.
We achieve state-of-the-art performance across several metrics. This approach
offers a scalable and innovative solution for creating dynamic, immersive
long-form stories that evolve organically from agent-driven interactions.

Conclusion: MPPA框架通过计划聚合和过程级监督有效解决了长推理链中的规划错误问题，提高了推理准确性和训练效率。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling enhances the reasoning ability of a language model
(LM) by extending its chain-of-thought (CoT). However, existing approaches
typically generate the entire reasoning chain in a single forward pass, which
often leads to CoT derailment, i.e., the reasoning trajectory drifting off
course due to compounding errors. This problem is particularly severe for
smaller LMs with long CoTs due to their limited capacity. To address this, we
analyze raw long CoTs and uncover a reasoning hierarchy consisting of planning
and execution steps. Our analysis reveals that most reasoning errors stem from
incorrect planning. Motivated by this observation, we propose Multi-Path Plan
Aggregation (MPPA), a framework that augments single-pass reasoning with plan
exploration and aggregation. Following a variable interval schedule based on
the token position, MPPA generates multiple candidate plans and aggregates them
into a refined planning step. To maintain efficiency, we adopt a minimal design
in which the base LM serves as the primary policy, while a lightweight LoRA
module implements the plan aggregation policy. We further observe that
outcome-reward RL is inefficient for long trajectories (e.g., exceeding 4K
tokens). To overcome this, we introduce online Step-DPO, a process-level
preference optimization scheme that leverages Twisted Sequential Monte Carlo
(TSMC) to provide scalable stepwise supervision using small LMs. This yields
more efficient training, improved stability, and higher accuracy. Extensive
experiments on challenging math, science, and logical reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that, with only 10% SFT data and 5% of preference pairs, our method
outperforms both the DeepSeek-R1 distillation baseline and the outcome-reward
RL baseline across multiple base models and tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, the research focus of large language models (LLMs) and
agents has shifted increasingly from demonstrating novel capabilities to
complex reasoning and tackling challenging tasks. However, existing evaluations
focus mainly on math/code contests or general tasks, while existing
multi-domain academic benchmarks lack sufficient reasoning depth, leaving the
field without a rigorous benchmark for high-level reasoning. To fill this gap,
we introduce the Acadreason benchmark, designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs
and agents to acquire and reason over academic knowledge. It consists of 50
expert-annotated academic problems across five high-reasoning domains,
including computer science, economics, law, mathematics, and philosophy. All
questions are sourced from top-tier publications in recent years and undergo
rigorous annotation and quality control to ensure they are both challenging and
answerable. We conduct systematic evaluations of over 10 mainstream LLMs and
agents. The results show that most LLMs scored below 20 points, with even the
cutting-edge GPT-5 achieving only 16 points. While agents achieved higher
scores, none exceeded 40 points. This demonstrates the current capability gap
between LLMs and agents in super-intelligent academic research tasks and
highlights the challenges of Acadreason.

Abstract: Recent multimodal embedding approaches leveraging multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) fine-tuned with contrastive learning (CL) have shown promising
results, yet the underlying reasons behind their superiority remain
underexplored. This work argues that a crucial advantage of MLLM-based
approaches stems from implicit cross-modal alignment achieved during generative
pretraining, where the language decoder learns to exploit multimodal signals
within a shared representation space for generating unimodal outputs. Through
analysis of anisotropy and kernel similarity structure, we empirically confirm
that latent alignment emerges within MLLM representations, allowing CL to serve
as a lightweight refinement stage. Leveraging this insight, we propose a
Language-Centric Omnimodal Embedding framework, termed LCO-Emb. Extensive
experiments across diverse backbones and benchmarks demonstrate its
effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance across modalities.
Furthermore, we identify a Generation-Representation Scaling Law (GRSL),
showing that the representational capabilities gained through contrastive
refinement scales positively with the MLLM's generative capabilities. This
suggests that improving generative abilities evolves as an effective paradigm
for enhancing representation quality. We provide a theoretical explanation of
GRSL, which formally links the MLLM's generative quality to the upper bound on
its representation performance, and validate it on a challenging, low-resource
visual-document retrieval task, showing that continual generative pretraining
before CL can further enhance the potential of a model's embedding
capabilities. Codes, models, and resources are available at

Method: 引入Agent Market Arena (AMA)基准，实现四种代理架构（InvestorAgent、TradeAgent、HedgeFundAgent、DeepFundAgent），在GPT-4o、GPT-4.1、Claude-3.5-haiku、Claude-sonnet-4和Gemini-2.0-flash等模型上评估。

Result: 实时实验显示代理框架表现出显著不同的行为模式（从激进风险承担到保守决策），而模型骨干对结果变异贡献较小。

Conclusion: AMA为LLM交易代理的金融推理和交易智能提供了严格、可重现且持续演进的评估基础。

Abstract: Although Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly used in
financial trading, it remains unclear whether they can reason and adapt in live
markets, as most studies test models instead of agents, cover limited periods
and assets, and rely on unverified data. To address these gaps, we introduce
Agent Market Arena (AMA), the first lifelong, real-time benchmark for
evaluating LLM-based trading agents across multiple markets. AMA integrates
verified trading data, expert-checked news, and diverse agent architectures
within a unified trading framework, enabling fair and continuous comparison
under real conditions. It implements four agents, including InvestorAgent as a
single-agent baseline, TradeAgent and HedgeFundAgent with different risk
styles, and DeepFundAgent with memory-based reasoning, and evaluates them
across GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5-haiku, Claude-sonnet-4, and
Gemini-2.0-flash. Live experiments on both cryptocurrency and stock markets
demonstrate that agent frameworks display markedly distinct behavioral
patterns, spanning from aggressive risk-taking to conservative decision-making,
whereas model backbones contribute less to outcome variation. AMA thus
establishes a foundation for rigorous, reproducible, and continuously evolving
evaluation of financial reasoning and trading intelligence in LLM-based agents.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了强化学习在智能体推理中的关键设计原则，发现使用真实端到端工具使用轨迹、探索友好技术以及深思熟虑策略能显著提升智能体推理能力，使小模型达到大模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前智能体强化学习虽然能提升LLMs的推理能力，但关键设计原则和最佳实践尚不明确，需要系统研究数据、算法和推理模式三个关键维度。

Method: 从数据、算法和推理模式三个角度进行系统性研究：使用真实端到端工具使用轨迹替代合成轨迹；采用探索友好技术（如clip higher、奖励塑形、保持策略熵）；采用深思熟虑策略减少工具调用。

Result: 提出的简单实践能持续增强智能体推理和训练效率，在AIME2024/AIME2025、GPQA-Diamond和LiveCodeBench-v6等挑战性基准上取得强劲结果，4B模型可达到32B模型的推理性能。

Conclusion: 研究确立了智能体强化学习的实用基线，为未来研究提供了高质量数据集和有效方法，证明了小模型通过适当方法也能实现卓越的智能体推理能力。

Abstract: Recently, the emergence of agentic RL has showcased that RL could also
effectively improve the agentic reasoning ability of LLMs, yet the key design
principles and optimal practices remain unclear. In this work, we conduct a
comprehensive and systematic investigation to demystify reinforcement learning
in agentic reasoning from three key perspectives: data, algorithm, and
reasoning mode. We highlight our key insights: (i) Replacing stitched synthetic
trajectories with real end-to-end tool-use trajectories yields a far stronger
SFT initialization; high-diversity, model-aware datasets sustain exploration
and markedly improve RL performance. (ii) Exploration-friendly techniques are
crucial for agentic RL, such as clip higher, overlong reward shaping, and
maintaining adequate policy entropy could improve the training efficiency.
(iii) A deliberative strategy with fewer tool calls outperforms frequent tool
calls or verbose self-reasoning, improving tool efficiency and final accuracy.
Together, these simple practices consistently enhance agentic reasoning and
training efficiency, achieving strong results on challenging benchmarks with
smaller models, and establishing a practical baseline for future agentic RL
research. Beyond these empirical insights, we further contribute a
high-quality, real end-to-end agentic SFT dataset along with a high-quality RL
dataset, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our insights in boosting the
agentic reasoning ability of LLMs across four challenging benchmarks, including
AIME2024/AIME2025, GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench-v6. With our recipes,
4B-sized models could also achieve superior agentic reasoning performance
compared to 32B-sized models. Code and models:

*Tsung-Han Wu,Mihran Miroyan,David M. Chan,Trevor Darrell,Narges Norouzi,Joseph E. Gonzalez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究挑战了大型推理模型在静态"冻结世界"评估中的局限性，提出在动态场景（中断和上下文变化）下评估模型鲁棒性，发现静态评估会高估模型性能，在动态环境中性能可能下降高达60%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估假设模型响应是瞬时的且上下文不变，但在现代推理任务（如辅助编程）中，模型可能需要数小时思考，期间代码可能发生显著变化，"冻结世界"假设不再适用。

Method: 在数学和编程基准测试中，评估LRM在两种动态场景下的表现：中断（测试模型在有限预算下的部分输出质量）和动态上下文（测试模型对飞行中变化的适应能力）。

Result: 静态评估一致高估鲁棒性：即使在静态设置中达到高精度的最先进LRM，在中断或上下文变化时也会不可预测地失败，当更新在推理过程后期引入时性能下降高达60%。

Conclusion: 揭示了新的失败模式：推理泄漏（中断时模型将推理折叠到最终答案中）、恐慌（时间压力下放弃推理返回错误答案）和自我怀疑（整合更新信息时性能下降），强调需要在动态环境中评估LRM鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning but are
traditionally evaluated in static, "frozen world" settings: model responses are
assumed to be instantaneous, and the context of a request is presumed to be
immutable over the duration of the response. While generally true for
short-term tasks, the "frozen world" assumption breaks down in modern reasoning
tasks such as assistive programming, where models may take hours to think
through problems and code may change dramatically from the time the model
starts thinking to the model's final output. In this work, we challenge the
frozen world assumption and evaluate LRM robustness under two realistic dynamic
scenarios: interruptions, which test the quality of the model's partial outputs
on a limited budget, and dynamic context, which tests model adaptation to
in-flight changes. Across mathematics and programming benchmarks that require
long-form reasoning, static evaluations consistently overestimate robustness:
even state-of-the-art LRMs, which achieve high accuracy in static settings, can
fail unpredictably when interrupted or exposed to changing context, with
performance dropping by up to 60% when updates are introduced late in the
reasoning process. Our analysis further reveals several novel failure modes,
including reasoning leakage, where models fold the reasoning into their final
answer when interrupted; panic, where under time pressure models abandon
reasoning entirely and return incorrect answers; and self-doubt, where
performance degrades while incorporating updated information.

TL;DR: 提出几何框架将LLM推理建模为表示空间中的流，通过分离逻辑结构和语义来研究LLM是否内化了超越表面形式的逻辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型如何在表示空间中"思考"，探索LLM是否真正内化了逻辑推理能力，而不仅仅是依赖表面语义模式。

Method: 使用几何框架将LLM推理建模为表示空间中的流（embedding轨迹），通过相同自然演绎命题搭配不同语义载体来分离逻辑和语义，并利用学习到的表示代理设计受控实验。

Result: 理论建立：1）LLM推理对应表示空间中的平滑流；2）逻辑语句作为这些流速度的局部控制器。实验验证了理论框架的可视化和量化能力。

Conclusion: 该工作为研究推理现象提供了概念基础和实践工具，为LLM行为的可解释性和形式分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: We study how large language models (LLMs) ``think'' through their
representation space. We propose a novel geometric framework that models an
LLM's reasoning as flows -- embedding trajectories evolving where logic goes.
We disentangle logical structure from semantics by employing the same natural
deduction propositions with varied semantic carriers, allowing us to test
whether LLMs internalize logic beyond surface form. This perspective connects
reasoning with geometric quantities such as position, velocity, and curvature,
enabling formal analysis in representation and concept spaces. Our theory
establishes: (1) LLM reasoning corresponds to smooth flows in representation
space, and (2) logical statements act as local controllers of these flows'
velocities. Using learned representation proxies, we design controlled
experiments to visualize and quantify reasoning flows, providing empirical
validation of our theoretical framework. Our work serves as both a conceptual
foundation and practical tools for studying reasoning phenomenon, offering a
new lens for interpretability and formal analysis of LLMs' behavior.

TL;DR: 提出了PULSE框架，用于更高效地评估人类与AI代理的交互，通过收集用户反馈、训练预测模型和结合人工评分与模型伪标签来计算结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试大多假设完全自动化，未能反映真实世界中人机协作的本质，需要更严谨地评估人类与代理的交互。

Method: 开发PULSE评估框架，包含用户反馈收集、用户满意度预测模型训练、人工评分与模型伪标签结合的结果计算；在OpenHands开源软件代理平台上部署，收集超过15k用户的使用数据。

Result: 框架使代理设计决策的置信区间比标准A/B测试减少40%；发现实际使用结果与基准测试性能存在显著差异（如claude-sonnet-4与gpt-5的反相关性）；通过案例研究揭示了LLM骨干、规划策略和记忆机制对开发者满意度的影响。

Conclusion: 研究为人类参与的LLM代理评估提供了指导，识别了改进代理设计的机会，强调了基准驱动评估的局限性。

Abstract: LLM-powered agents are both a promising new technology and a source of
complexity, where choices about models, tools, and prompting can affect their
usefulness. While numerous benchmarks measure agent accuracy across domains,
they mostly assume full automation, failing to represent the collaborative
nature of real-world use cases. In this paper, we make two major steps towards
the rigorous assessment of human-agent interactions. First, we propose PULSE, a
framework for more efficient human-centric evaluation of agent designs, which
comprises collecting user feedback, training an ML model to predict user
satisfaction, and computing results by combining human satisfaction ratings
with model-generated pseudo-labels. Second, we deploy the framework on a
large-scale web platform built around the open-source software agent OpenHands,
collecting in-the-wild usage data across over 15k users. We conduct case
studies around how three agent design decisions -- choice of LLM backbone,
planning strategy, and memory mechanisms -- impact developer satisfaction
rates, yielding practical insights for software agent design. We also show how
our framework can lead to more robust conclusions about agent design, reducing
confidence intervals by 40\% compared to a standard A/B test. Finally, we find
substantial discrepancies between in-the-wild results and benchmark performance
(e.g., the anti-correlation between results comparing claude-sonnet-4 and
gpt-5), underscoring the limitations of benchmark-driven evaluation. Our
findings provide guidance for evaluations of LLM agents with humans and
identify opportunities for better agent designs.

TL;DR: AETHER是一个轻量级框架，通过POI多模态对齐将AlphaEarth地球观测表示与人类中心语义结合，提升城市分析能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有地球观测驱动的空间表示主要编码物理和光谱模式，缺乏捕捉城市功能和社会经济维度的人类活动信息。

Method: 使用多模态对齐方法，将AlphaEarth嵌入与POI文本表示对齐，在预训练AE基础上进行轻量级语义增强。

Result: 在伦敦地区，AETHER相比AE基线在土地利用分类F1得分提升7.2%，社会经济映射的KL散度降低23.6%。

Conclusion: 通过耦合地球观测与人类中心语义，AETHER推进了地理空间基础模型向整合物理形态和功能意义的通用城市表示发展。

Abstract: General-purpose spatial representations are essential for building
transferable geospatial foundation models (GFMs). Among them, the AlphaEarth
Foundation (AE) represents a major step toward a global, unified representation
of the Earth's surface, learning 10-meter embeddings from multi-source Earth
Observation (EO) data that capture rich physical and environmental patterns
across diverse landscapes. However, such EO-driven representations remain
limited in capturing the functional and socioeconomic dimensions of cities, as
they primarily encode physical and spectral patterns rather than human
activities or spatial functions. We propose AETHER (AlphaEarth-POI Enriched
Representation Learning), a lightweight framework that adapts AlphaEarth to
human-centered urban analysis through multimodal alignment guided by Points of
Interest (POIs). AETHER aligns AE embeddings with textual representations of
POIs, enriching physically grounded EO features with semantic cues about urban
functions and socioeconomic contexts. In Greater London, AETHER achieves
consistent gains over the AE baseline, with a 7.2% relative improvement in
land-use classification F1 and a 23.6% relative reduction in Kullback-Leibler
divergence for socioeconomic mapping. Built upon pretrained AE, AETHER
leverages a lightweight multimodal alignment to enrich it with human-centered
semantics while remaining computationally efficient and scalable for urban
applications. By coupling EO with human-centered semantics, it advances
geospatial foundation models toward general-purpose urban representations that
integrate both physical form and functional meaning.

Abstract: Computing has long served as a cornerstone of scientific discovery. Recently,
a paradigm shift has emerged with the rise of large language models (LLMs),
introducing autonomous systems, referred to as agents, that accelerate
discovery across varying levels of autonomy. These language agents provide a
flexible and versatile framework that orchestrates interactions with human
scientists, natural language, computer language and code, and physics. This
paper presents our view and vision of LLM-based scientific agents and their
growing role in transforming the scientific discovery lifecycle, from
hypothesis discovery, experimental design and execution, to result analysis and
refinement. We critically examine current methodologies, emphasizing key
innovations, practical achievements, and outstanding limitations. Additionally,
we identify open research challenges and outline promising directions for
building more robust, generalizable, and adaptive scientific agents. Our
analysis highlights the transformative potential of autonomous agents to
accelerate scientific discovery across diverse domains.

TL;DR: 研究发现，当AI系统整合用户记忆时，会基于用户的社会经济状况产生系统性情感理解偏差，优势群体获得更准确的情感解读，可能导致强化社会不平等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着个性化AI系统越来越多地整合长期用户记忆，了解这种记忆如何影响情感推理至关重要，特别是当AI基于用户背景信息产生不同情感解读时。

Method: 通过评估15个大语言模型在人类验证的情感智能测试上的表现，使用相同情境搭配不同用户档案来检验情感理解的系统性差异。

Result: 发现相同情境下不同用户档案会产生系统性的情感解读差异，多个高性能LLM中对优势群体有更准确的情感理解，且在情感理解和支持性建议任务中存在显著的人口统计因素差异。

Conclusion: 为个性化设计的AI系统可能无意中强化社会不平等，这是记忆增强AI面临的关键挑战。

Abstract: When an AI assistant remembers that Sarah is a single mother working two
jobs, does it interpret her stress differently than if she were a wealthy
executive? As personalized AI systems increasingly incorporate long-term user
memory, understanding how this memory shapes emotional reasoning is critical.
We investigate how user memory affects emotional intelligence in large language
models (LLMs) by evaluating 15 models on human validated emotional intelligence
tests. We find that identical scenarios paired with different user profiles
produce systematically divergent emotional interpretations. Across validated
user independent emotional scenarios and diverse user profiles, systematic
biases emerged in several high-performing LLMs where advantaged profiles
received more accurate emotional interpretations. Moreover, LLMs demonstrate
significant disparities across demographic factors in emotion understanding and
supportive recommendations tasks, indicating that personalization mechanisms
can embed social hierarchies into models emotional reasoning. These results
highlight a key challenge for memory enhanced AI: systems designed for
personalization may inadvertently reinforce social inequalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在关键推理缺陷，包括幻觉倾向和逻辑谬误分类准确性差，这源于其默认的快速直觉式系统1处理方式，而可靠推理需要深思熟虑的系统2方法。

Method: 引入新颖的逐步指令数据集，将谬误分类分解为一系列原子程序步骤（简单二元问题），并通过查询相关谬误关系知识图谱进行最终验证。

Result: 这种基于程序规则的干预显著提高了LLM的逻辑谬误分类性能，并为模型决策提供了更好的透明度。

Conclusion: 该方法为神经符号架构解决LLM推理缺陷提供了一条实用路径，展示了低成本干预在提升模型推理能力方面的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from critical reasoning gaps, including a
tendency to hallucinate and poor accuracy in classifying logical fallacies.
This limitation stems from their default System 1 processing, which is fast and
intuitive, whereas reliable reasoning requires the deliberate, effortful System
2 approach (Kahneman, 2011; Li et al., 2025). Since full System 2 training is
often prohibitively expensive, we explore a low-cost, instruction-based
intervention to bridge this gap. Our methodology introduces a novel stepwise
instruction dataset that decomposes fallacy classification into a series of
atomic procedural steps (simple binary questions). We further augment this with
a final verification step where models consult a relational knowledge graph of
related fallacies. This procedural, rule-based intervention yields a
significant improvement in LLM logical fallacy classification. Crucially, the
approach also provides enhanced transparency into the LLMs' decision-making,
highlighting a practical pathway for Neuro-symbolic architectures to address
LLM reasoning deficits.

TL;DR: 本文通过LLM辩论研究多轮对话中的道德推理和价值对齐，发现不同模型在同步和轮询辩论格式下表现出显著的行为差异和价值偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在敏感日常场景中的部署增加，理解它们在复杂道德推理中体现的价值至关重要。现有研究多关注单轮提示，但多轮对话中价值通过讨论、修正和共识形成的过程尚不明确。

Method: 使用三个模型(GPT-4.1、Claude 3.7 Sonnet、Gemini 2.0 Flash)在Reddit的"Am I the Asshole"社区的1000个日常困境中进行集体归责辩论，采用同步(并行响应)和轮询(顺序响应)两种格式测试顺序效应和裁决修正。

Result: GPT表现出强惯性(0.6-3.1%修正率)，而Claude和Gemini更灵活(28-41%)。价值模式也不同：GPT强调个人自主和直接沟通，Claude和Gemini优先考虑同理心对话。辩论格式对模型行为有强烈影响，GPT和Gemini表现出高度从众性。

Conclusion: 审议格式和模型特定行为塑造多轮互动中的道德推理，表明社会技术对齐不仅取决于系统输出，还取决于对话结构方式。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive
everyday contexts - offering personal advice, mental health support, and moral
guidance - understanding their elicited values in navigating complex moral
reasoning is essential. Most evaluations study this sociotechnical alignment
through single-turn prompts, but it is unclear if these findings extend to
multi-turn settings where values emerge through dialogue, revision, and
consensus. We address this gap using LLM debate to examine deliberative
dynamics and value alignment in multi-turn settings by prompting subsets of
three models (GPT-4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) to collectively
assign blame in 1,000 everyday dilemmas from Reddit's "Am I the Asshole"
community. We use both synchronous (parallel responses) and round-robin
(sequential responses) formats to test order effects and verdict revision. Our
findings show striking behavioral differences. In the synchronous setting, GPT
showed strong inertia (0.6-3.1% revision rates) while Claude and Gemini were
far more flexible (28-41%). Value patterns also diverged: GPT emphasized
personal autonomy and direct communication, while Claude and Gemini prioritized
empathetic dialogue. Certain values proved especially effective at driving
verdict changes. We further find that deliberation format had a strong impact
on model behavior: GPT and Gemini stood out as highly conforming relative to
Claude, with their verdict behavior strongly shaped by order effects. These
results show how deliberation format and model-specific behaviors shape moral
reasoning in multi-turn interactions, underscoring that sociotechnical
alignment depends on how systems structure dialogue as much as on their
outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注简化RAG架构的白盒攻击，缺乏对复杂现实场景中黑盒攻击的研究，其中攻击者不了解系统内部细节且RAG系统包含多个组件。

Method: 使用强化学习优化中毒文档生成模型，将目标RAG系统视为黑盒，仅利用攻击是否成功的信息来训练生成器，确保生成的中毒文档符合目标系统的偏好。

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效攻击大多数复杂RAG系统，攻击成功率相比基线方法提升高达0.72。

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了当前防御方法的普遍缺陷，为LLM安全研究提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems based on Large Language Models
(LLMs) have become a core technology for tasks such as question-answering (QA)
and content generation. However, by injecting poisoned documents into the
database of RAG systems, attackers can manipulate LLMs to generate text that
aligns with their intended preferences. Existing research has primarily focused
on white-box attacks against simplified RAG architectures. In this paper, we
investigate a more complex and realistic scenario: the attacker lacks knowledge
of the RAG system's internal composition and implementation details, and the
RAG system comprises components beyond a mere retriever. Specifically, we
propose the RIPRAG attack framework, an end-to-end attack pipeline that treats
the target RAG system as a black box, where the only information accessible to
the attacker is whether the poisoning succeeds. Our method leverages
Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize the generation model for poisoned
documents, ensuring that the generated poisoned document aligns with the target
RAG system's preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that this method can
effectively execute poisoning attacks against most complex RAG systems,
achieving an attack success rate (ASR) improvement of up to 0.72 compared to
baseline methods. This highlights prevalent deficiencies in current defensive
methods and provides critical insights for LLM security research.

TL;DR: 提出CE-Graph框架，通过分布视角优化LLM工作流，直接最小化期望失败质量而非最大化标量分数，实现更高效的失败分布建模和优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM工作流优化方法存在信息崩溃问题，将丰富的多步骤执行轨迹简化为成功/失败信号，无法建模失败分布结构。

Method: 引入失败签名空间(FSS)概念，通过反例池近似失败分布，识别密集失败模式，使用提出-验证机制进行目标图编辑来贪婪减少失败质量。

Result: 在数学、代码和问答基准测试中，CE-Graph以显著更低的成本实现了比强基线更高的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 系统可靠性源于系统性地学习和重塑失败分布的几何结构，而非单纯避免失败。

Abstract: Optimizing LLM-based workflows is typically formulated as a global search,
where candidate workflows are evaluated based on a scalar metric. This
paradigm, however, suffers from a critical flaw: information collapse. By
reducing rich, multi-step execution traces to simple success/failure signals,
existing methods are rendered blind to the underlying structure of failures,
fundamentally preventing them from modeling the workflow's failure
distribution. We reconceptualize this challenge as a distributional problem. We
propose a new paradigm where the optimization goal is not to maximize a scalar
score, but to directly minimize a workflow's Expected Failure Mass, i.e., the
integral of its failure probability density function defined over a
high-dimensional Failure Signature Space (FSS). This distributional lens allows
us to move from inefficient, zero-order optimization to a principled,
gradient-like descent on the failure landscape itself. We introduce CE-Graph, a
framework that operationalizes this paradigm through a novel, failure-driven
refinement process. CE-Graph approximates the failure distribution from a pool
of counterexamples, identifies its densest regions as recurring failure modes,
and applies targeted, operator-constrained graph edits via a Propose-and-Verify
mechanism to greedily reduce the failure mass. On math, code, and QA
benchmarks, our CE-Graph achieves higher robustness at a significantly lower
cost than strong baselines. This suggests that a system's reliability emerges
not from avoiding failures, but from systematically learning and reshaping the
geometric structure of its failure distributions.

TL;DR: 提出了一个图论框架，将可信度与置信度分离，通过收缩传播过程计算置信度，定义推理区域作为高置信度、结构平衡的子图，支持在全局矛盾下进行局部经典推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信念系统很少具有全局一致性，但有效的推理通常能在局部持续存在。需要一种能够容忍矛盾、在结构支持的局部区域激活经典逻辑的推理框架。

Method: 使用有向、带符号、带权重的图表示信念，边编码支持和矛盾关系。通过收缩传播过程计算置信度，定义推理区域为高置信度、结构平衡的子图，并提供近线性算法构建区域图谱。

Result: 框架能够在全局矛盾的情况下识别出局部一致的推理区域，支持信念变化的建模，通过冲击更新实现局部重新配置而不破坏整个图的稳定性。

Conclusion: 该框架为容忍矛盾的推理提供了理论基础，能够在结构支持的精确位置激活经典逻辑，实现局部有效推理。

Abstract: Belief systems are rarely globally consistent, yet effective reasoning often
persists locally. We propose a novel graph-theoretic framework that cleanly
separates credibility--external, a priori trust in sources--from confidence--an
internal, emergent valuation induced by network structure. Beliefs are nodes in
a directed, signed, weighted graph whose edges encode support and
contradiction. Confidence is obtained by a contractive propagation process that
mixes a stated prior with structure-aware influence and guarantees a unique,
stable solution. Within this dynamics, we define reasoning zones:
high-confidence, structurally balanced subgraphs on which classical inference
is safe despite global contradictions. We provide a near-linear procedure that
seeds zones by confidence, tests balance using a parity-based coloring, and
applies a greedy, locality-preserving repair with Jaccard de-duplication to
build a compact atlas. To model belief change, we introduce shock updates that
locally downscale support and elevate targeted contradictions while preserving
contractivity via a simple backtracking rule. Re-propagation yields localized
reconfiguration-zones may shrink, split, or collapse--without destabilizing the
entire graph. We outline an empirical protocol on synthetic signed graphs with
planted zones, reporting zone recovery, stability under shocks, and runtime.
The result is a principled foundation for contradiction-tolerant reasoning that
activates classical logic precisely where structure supports it.

TL;DR: SwarmSys是一个受群体智能启发的分布式多智能体推理框架，通过探索者、工作者和验证者三个角色的迭代交互实现自组织协调，在符号推理、研究综合和科学编程任务中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体框架依赖固定角色或集中控制，限制了长时程推理的可扩展性和适应性。

Method: 集成自适应智能体和事件档案、基于嵌入的概率匹配、信息素启发的强化机制，支持动态任务分配和无全局监督的自组织收敛。

Result: 在多个任务中持续优于基线方法，提高了准确性和推理稳定性。

Conclusion: 群体启发的协调是构建可扩展、鲁棒和自适应多智能体推理的有前景范式，协调扩展可能与模型扩展在推进LLM智能方面相媲美。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable reasoning abilities.
However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on fixed roles or
centralized control, limiting scalability and adaptability in long-horizon
reasoning. We introduce SwarmSys, a closed-loop framework for distributed
multi-agent reasoning inspired by swarm intelligence. Coordination in SwarmSys
emerges through iterative interactions among three specialized roles,
Explorers, Workers, and Validators, that continuously cycle through
exploration, exploitation, and validation. To enable scalable and adaptive
collaboration, we integrate adaptive agent and event profiles, embedding-based
probabilistic matching, and a pheromone-inspired reinforcement mechanism,
supporting dynamic task allocation and self-organizing convergence without
global supervision. Across symbolic reasoning, research synthesis, and
scientific programming tasks, SwarmSys consistently outperforms baselines,
improving both accuracy and reasoning stability. These findings highlight
swarm-inspired coordination as a promising paradigm for scalable, robust, and
adaptive multi-agent reasoning, suggesting that coordination scaling may rival
model scaling in advancing LLM intelligence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SyncLipMAE是一个自监督预训练框架，通过掩码视觉建模和跨模态对比对齐，从无标签的视听流中学习同步感知和可转移的面部动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决说话人脸视频中面部动态与音频同步的问题，并学习可转移到多个下游任务的面部表示。

Method: 结合掩码视觉建模和跨模态对比对齐，使用三个逐帧提示标记（身份、语音运动、环境运动）来分解面部动态，通过对比学习实现音频-视觉流同步。

Result: 在四个需要不同能力的任务家族中实现了最先进的结果，包括视听流同步、面部表情识别、视觉语音识别和视觉配音。

Conclusion: 同步感知、分解的自监督预训练方法在多个下游任务中表现出有效性，证明了该框架的通用性和强大性能。

Abstract: We introduce SyncLipMAE, a self-supervised pretraining framework for
talking-face video that learns synchronization-aware and transferable facial
dynamics from unlabeled audio-visual streams. Our approach couples masked
visual modeling with cross-modal contrastive alignment and employs three
per-frame prompt tokens that explicitly encode the essential factors of a
talking-face frame - identity, vocal motion (speech-synchronized facial
dynamics), and ambient motion (audio-agnostic movements such as blinks and head
pose). The contrastive objective uses time-aligned vocal-motion and audio
tokens as positives and misaligned pairs as negatives, driving both modalities
into a shared embedding space and yielding token-level audio-visual stream
synchronization. After pretraining, the aligned audio tokens together with the
visual prompt tokens (identity, vocal motion, ambient motion) form a unified
interface for four disparate downstream settings: (i) audio-visual stream
synchronization; (ii) facial emotion and head/face action recognition; (iii)
visual speech recognition; and (iv) visual dubbing, for which we enable
indistinguishable audio- or video-driven control within a single model. Across
four task families that require distinct capabilities, SyncLipMAE achieves
state-of-the-art results, underscoring the effectiveness of
synchronization-aware, factorized self-supervised pretraining.

TL;DR: StepFly是一个用于自动化IT系统故障排除指南(TSG)的端到端代理框架，通过三阶段工作流解决现有LLM方案在TSG质量、复杂控制流、数据密集型查询和并行执行方面的不足，在真实TSG上实现94%成功率，并行TSG执行时间减少32.9%-70.4%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模IT系统中的故障管理依赖故障排除指南(TSG)，但手动执行缓慢且易出错。现有基于LLM的解决方案缺乏对TSG质量问题、复杂控制流解释、数据密集型查询处理和并行执行利用等关键挑战的专业支持。

Method: StepFly采用三阶段工作流：1) TSG Mentor工具帮助SRE改进TSG质量；2) 离线预处理使用LLM从非结构化TSG中提取结构化执行DAG并创建专用查询准备插件(QPPs)；3) 在线执行使用DAG引导的调度器-执行器框架，支持并行执行独立步骤。

Result: 在真实TSG和事件上的实证评估显示，StepFly在GPT-4.1上达到约94%的成功率，优于基线方法且时间和token消耗更少。对于可并行TSG，实现了32.9%到70.4%的显著执行时间减少。

Conclusion: StepFly通过其创新的三阶段框架有效解决了TSG自动化的关键挑战，显著提高了故障排除的成功率和效率，特别是在支持并行执行方面表现出色。

Abstract: Effective incident management in large-scale IT systems relies on
troubleshooting guides (TSGs), but their manual execution is slow and
error-prone. While recent advances in LLMs offer promise for automating
incident management tasks, existing LLM-based solutions lack specialized
support for several key challenges, including managing TSG quality issues,
interpreting complex control flow, handling data-intensive queries, and
exploiting execution parallelism. We first conducted an empirical study on 92
real-world TSGs, and, guided by our findings, we present StepFly, a novel
end-to-end agentic framework for troubleshooting guide automation. Our approach
features a three-stage workflow: the first stage provides a comprehensive guide
together with a tool, TSG Mentor, to assist SREs in improving TSG quality; the
second stage performs offline preprocessing using LLMs to extract structured
execution DAGs from unstructured TSGs and to create dedicated Query Preparation
Plugins (QPPs); and the third stage executes online using a DAG-guided
scheduler-executor framework with a memory system to guarantee correct workflow
and support parallel execution of independent steps. Our empirical evaluation
on a collection of real-world TSGs and incidents demonstrates that StepFly
achieves a ~94% success rate on GPT-4.1, outperforming baselines with less time
and token consumption. Furthermore, it achieves a remarkable execution time
reduction of 32.9% to 70.4% for parallelizable TSGs.

TL;DR: DixitWorld是一个评估视觉语言模型多模态溯因推理能力的综合测试套件，包含动态多代理环境DixitArena和静态问答基准DixitBench，揭示了生成创造性和判别理解之间的关键权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对视觉语言模型多模态溯因推理能力的评估主要局限于静态、单代理任务，需要更全面的评估框架来解构这一挑战。

Method: 引入DixitWorld评估套件，包含：1) DixitArena - 动态多代理环境，评估假设生成（讲故事者）和假设选择（听者）；2) DixitBench - 静态QA基准，隔离听者任务进行控制评估。

Result: 较小开源模型在创造性讲故事方面表现优异，但线索区分度较差；较大专有模型整体表现更优，特别是在听者角色。DixitBench与DixitArena听者结果强相关。

Conclusion: 多模态溯因推理中存在生成创造性和判别理解的关键权衡，这是开发更平衡、更强大视觉语言代理的核心挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal abductive reasoning--the generation and selection of explanatory
hypotheses from partial observations--is a cornerstone of intelligence. Current
evaluations of this ability in vision-language models (VLMs) are largely
confined to static, single-agent tasks. Inspired by Dixit, we introduce
DixitWorld, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to deconstruct this
challenge. DIXITWORLD features two core components: DixitArena, a dynamic,
multi-agent environment that evaluates both hypothesis generation (a
"storyteller" crafting cryptic clues) and hypothesis selection ("listeners"
choosing the target image from decoys) under imperfect information; and
DixitBench, a static QA benchmark that isolates the listener's task for
efficient, controlled evaluation. Results from DixitArena reveal distinct,
role-dependent behaviors: smaller open-source models often excel as creative
storytellers, producing imaginative yet less discriminative clues, whereas
larger proprietary models demonstrate superior overall performance,
particularly as listeners. Performance on DixitBench strongly correlates with
listener results in DixitArena, validating it as a reliable proxy for
hypothesis selection. Our findings reveal a key trade-off between generative
creativity and discriminative understanding in multimodal abductive reasoning,
a central challenge for developing more balanced and capable vision-language
agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保角色身份一致性在基于扩散的文本到图像生成中仍然是一个基本限制。

Method: 在冻结的扩散骨干网络上构建，使用可组合的LoRA适配器，通过提示感知控制在推理时动态组合适配器。

Result: 在多场景叙事实验中，CharCom显著提升了角色保真度、语义对齐和时间一致性，在拥挤场景中保持鲁棒性，并能以最小开销实现可扩展的多角色生成。

Conclusion: 该框架适用于故事插图和动画等实际应用场景。

Abstract: Ensuring character identity consistency across varying prompts remains a
fundamental limitation in diffusion-based text-to-image generation. We propose
CharCom, a modular and parameter-efficient framework that achieves
character-consistent story illustration through composable LoRA adapters,
enabling efficient per-character customization without retraining the base
model. Built on a frozen diffusion backbone, CharCom dynamically composes
adapters at inference using prompt-aware control. Experiments on multi-scene
narratives demonstrate that CharCom significantly enhances character fidelity,
semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. It remains robust in crowded scenes
and enables scalable multi-character generation with minimal overhead, making
it well-suited for real-world applications such as story illustration and
animation.

TL;DR: 提出了性能感知长度更新(PALU)方法，通过约束优化和拉格朗日优化来生成简洁推理步骤，在减少输出长度的同时提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有简洁推理方法依赖手工启发式规则，难以平衡简洁性与性能，且无法跨领域和模型规模适应。

Method: 将简洁推理建模为约束优化问题，使用拉格朗日优化转化为无约束问题，并通过三个近似简化更新规则：离策略评估性能、截断拉格朗日乘子、基于分位数的长度调整。

Result: 在DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B上，输出长度减少65%，准确率提高15%，在五个基准测试中优于其他方法，并能跨领域和模型规模适应。

Conclusion: PALU是一种实用有效的简洁推理方法，能够平衡简洁性与性能，具有良好的适应性。

Abstract: Concise reasoning in large language models seeks to generate only essential
intermediate steps needed to arrive at a final answer, thereby alleviating
issues of overthinking. Most proposed approaches hinge on carefully
hand-crafted heuristics, struggling to balance concision with performance,
often failing to adapt across domains and model scales. In this work, we
address these challenges by introducing a principled and pragmatic strategy,
performance-aware length updating (PALU). As a principled algorithm, PALU
formulates concise reasoning as a constrained optimization problem, minimizing
response length subject to a performance constraint, and then applies
Lagrangian optimization to convert it into a tractable unconstrained problem.
As a pragmatic solution, PALU streamlines complicated update rules through
three approximations: (i) estimating performance with off-policy rollouts, (ii)
truncating the Lagrange multiplier to two extremes, and (iii) replacing
gradient-based updates with quantile-driven length adjustments. PALU reduces
output length by 65% while improving accuracy by 15% when applied to
DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, averaged over five benchmarks, outperforming a
range of alternative methods. Furthermore, PALU is demonstrated to adapt across
both domain (logic, STEM and math) and model scale (1.5B, 7B, 14B) entrenching
the algorithm as a practical and effective concise reasoning approach.

TL;DR: SAFER是一个两阶段风险控制框架，通过弃权感知采样和保形过滤来解决开放域问答中缺乏固定解空间的问题，提供统计保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有选择性保形预测方法不切实际地假设所有实例的可接受答案都能通过有限采样获得，但在开放域问答场景中缺乏固定有限的解空间。

Method: SAFER包含两个阶段：1) 在验证集上使用Clopper-Pearson精确方法校准采样预算；2) 应用保形风险控制方法确定统计有效的置信度阈值来过滤不可靠候选答案。

Result: SAFER能够控制正确答案被排除的风险，并与各种任务特定的准入标准和验证-测试分割比例兼容，具有鲁棒性和高数据效率。

Conclusion: SAFER为开放域问答中缺乏固定解空间的问题提供了有效的风险控制解决方案，确保大语言模型输出的可信度。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in risk-sensitive
applications such as real-world open-ended question answering (QA), ensuring
the trustworthiness of their outputs has become critical. Existing selective
conformal prediction (SCP) methods provide statistical guarantees by
constructing prediction sets with a constrained miscoverage rate for correct
answers. However, prior works unrealistically assume that admissible answers
for all instances can be obtained via finite sampling, even for open-ended QA
scenarios that lack a fixed and finite solution space. To address this, we
introduce a two-stage risk control framework comprising abstention-aware
sampling and conformalized filtering (SAFER). Firstly, on a held-out
calibration set, SAFER calibrates a sampling budget within the maximum sampling
cap, using the Clopper-Pearson exact method at a user-desired risk level (i.e.,
the maximum allowable miscoverage rate of the sampling sets). If the risk level
cannot be satisfied within the cap, we abstain; otherwise, the calibrated
sampling budget becomes the minimum requirements at test time. Then, we employ
calibration instances where correct answers are attainable under the calibrated
budget and apply the conformal risk control method to determine a statistically
valid uncertainty threshold, which filters unreliable distractors from the
candidate set for each test data point. In this stage, SAFER introduces an
additional risk level to guide the calculation of the threshold, thereby
controlling the risk of correct answers being excluded. Furthermore, we show
that SAFER is compatible with various task-specific admission criteria and
calibration-test split ratios, highlighting its robustness and high data
efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为环境调优的新训练范式，让LLM智能体直接从问题实例中学习复杂行为，无需依赖预先收集的专家轨迹，解决了SFT过拟合和RL冷启动问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在复杂多轮工具使用任务中潜力巨大，但高质量训练数据极度稀缺。SFT在合成数据上会导致过拟合，而标准RL面临冷启动问题和训练不稳定性。

Method: 环境调优通过结构化课程、提供纠正反馈的环境增强和细粒度进展奖励来组织学习过程，确保稳定高效的探索。

Result: 仅使用BFCL基准中的400个问题实例，该方法不仅实现了与强基线相当的分布内性能，还展现出优越的分布外泛化能力，克服了SFT方法的性能崩溃问题。

Conclusion: 这项工作实现了从基于静态轨迹的监督微调到动态环境探索的范式转变，为训练更鲁棒和数据高效的智能体铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents show great promise for complex, multi-turn
tool-use tasks, but their development is often hampered by the extreme scarcity
of high-quality training data. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic data
leads to overfitting, whereas standard reinforcement learning (RL) struggles
with a critical cold-start problem and training instability. To address these
challenges, we introduce $\textbf{Environment Tuning}$, a novel training
paradigm that enables agents to learn complex behaviors directly from problem
instances without relying on pre-collected expert trajectories.
$\textbf{Environment Tuning}$ orchestrates this learning process through a
structured curriculum, actionable environment augmentation that provides
corrective feedback, and fine-grained progress rewards to ensure stable and
efficient exploration. Using only 400 problem instances from Berkeley
Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) benchmark, our method not only achieves
competitive in-distribution performance against strong baselines but also
demonstrates superior out-of-distribution generalization, overcoming the
performance collapse common to SFT-based approaches. Our work presents a
paradigm shift from supervised fine-tuning on static trajectories to dynamic,
environment-based exploration, paving the way for training more robust and
data-efficient agents.

Motivation: 现有激活引导方法依赖粗糙启发式，缺乏对引导位置和干预强度的原则性考虑，需要更可靠的行为控制方法来部署大语言模型。

Method: 从双视角（尾平均和末端标记）学习属性对齐子空间，通过约束几何目标选择干预强度，执行样本级正交残差校准，使用轻量级位置扫描识别可注入位置。

Result: 在各种模型和评估范式下，PIXEL持续改进属性对齐，同时保持模型通用能力，为大语言模型的可控生成提供了实用且原则性的方法。

Conclusion: PIXEL提供了一个无需调优的激活引导框架，通过位置感知干预和最小干预原则，实现了可靠的行为对齐，为大语言模型的可控生成提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Reliable behavior control is central to deploying large language models
(LLMs) on the web. Activation steering offers a tuning-free route to align
attributes (e.g., truthfulness) that ensure trustworthy generation. Prevailing
approaches rely on coarse heuristics and lack a principled account of where to
steer and how strongly to intervene. To this end, we propose Position-wise
Injection with eXact Estimated Levels (PIXEL), a position-wise activation
steering framework that, in contrast to prior work, learns a property-aligned
subspace from dual views (tail-averaged and end-token) and selects intervention
strength via a constrained geometric objective with a closed-form solution,
thereby adapting to token-level sensitivity without global hyperparameter
tuning. PIXEL further performs sample-level orthogonal residual calibration to
refine the global attribute direction and employs a lightweight
position-scanning routine to identify receptive injection sites. We
additionally provide representation-level guarantees for the
minimal-intervention rule, supporting reliable alignment. Across diverse models
and evaluation paradigms, PIXEL consistently improves attribute alignment while
preserving model general capabilities, offering a practical and principled
method for LLMs' controllable generation. Our code is available at

Motivation: 长推理模型在推理过程中存在过度思考问题，导致计算成本增加和推理延迟上升，需要一种能平衡推理性能与效率的方法。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：1) 监督微调阶段构建混合推理数据集；2) 强化学习阶段引入熵引导混合策略优化(EHPO)，在高熵单元进行分支，并使用难度感知惩罚来平衡快速和慢速推理。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，ADR实现了推理性能与效率的有效平衡，性能提升高达6.1%，同时推理输出长度减少49.5%至59.3%。

Conclusion: ADR通过自适应双推理模式成功解决了长推理模型的过度思考问题，在保持高性能的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Although Long Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved superior performance on
various reasoning scenarios, they often suffer from increased computational
costs and inference latency caused by overthinking. To address these
limitations, we propose Adaptive Dual Reasoner, which supports two reasoning
modes: fast thinking and slow thinking. ADR dynamically alternates between
these modes based on the contextual complexity during reasoning. ADR is trained
in two stages: (1) A cold-start stage using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to
equip the model with the ability to integrate both fast and slow reasoning
modes, in which we construct a hybrid reasoning dataset through a dedicated
pipeline to provide large-scale supervision. (2) A reinforcement learning stage
for optimizing reasoning effort, where we introduce Entropy-guided Hybrid
Policy Optimization EHPO, an RL training framework employing an entropy-guided
dynamic rollout strategy for branching at high-entropy units and a
difficulty-aware penalty to balance fast and slow reasoning. Across challenging
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ADR achieves an effective balance between
reasoning performance and efficiency among state-of-the-art approaches.
Specifically, ADR yields a performance gain of up to 6.1%, while reducing the
reasoning output length by 49.5% to 59.3%.

Method: 提出基于扰动的因果识别方法，系统定位LLMs中的关键神经元。

Result: 发现：(1)LLMs存在超稀疏关键神经元集，破坏它们可使720亿参数模型完全崩溃，困惑度增加20个数量级；(2)关键神经元非均匀分布，集中在外层MLP down_proj组件；(3)性能退化呈现急剧相变而非渐进下降。

Conclusion: 这些发现为开发更鲁棒的模型架构和提高安全关键应用中的部署安全性提供了指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational tools in natural
language processing, powering a wide range of applications and research. Many
studies have shown that LLMs share significant similarities with the human
brain. Recent neuroscience research has found that a small subset of biological
neurons in the human brain are crucial for core cognitive functions, which
raises a fundamental question: do LLMs also contain a small subset of critical
neurons? In this paper, we investigate this question by proposing a
Perturbation-based Causal Identification of Critical Neurons method to
systematically locate such critical neurons in LLMs. Our findings reveal three
key insights: (1) LLMs contain ultra-sparse critical neuron sets. Disrupting
these critical neurons can cause a 72B-parameter model with over 1.1 billion
neurons to completely collapse, with perplexity increasing by up to 20 orders
of magnitude; (2) These critical neurons are not uniformly distributed, but
tend to concentrate in the outer layers, particularly within the MLP down\_proj
components; (3) Performance degradation exhibits sharp phase transitions,
rather than a gradual decline, when these critical neurons are disrupted.
Through comprehensive experiments across diverse model architectures and
scales, we provide deeper analysis of these phenomena and their implications
for LLM robustness and interpretability. These findings can offer guidance for
developing more robust model architectures and improving deployment security in
safety-critical applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级的两步插件方法，通过识别感知和推理导向的注意力头并调节其贡献，有效减少多模态大推理模型的幻觉问题，在多个基准测试中平均提升5%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大推理模型存在幻觉问题，表现为错误的推理链和视觉内容误解。研究发现注意力头存在阶段性分工：浅层头主要负责感知，深层头转向符号推理，揭示了感知偏差和推理漂移是幻觉的两大原因。

Method: 提出功能性头识别和类条件重缩放的两步插件方法，定位感知和推理导向的注意力头，在不重新训练的情况下调节其贡献。

Result: 在三个真实世界MLRM模型、六个基准测试和四个基线方法上的评估显示，该方法平均提升5%性能，最高可达15%，仅增加<1%的计算开销和9%的基线延迟。

Conclusion: 该方法完全模型无关，显著提升了现有多模态大推理模型的可靠性和可解释性，使其能够安全部署在高风险应用中。

Abstract: Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are rapidly advancing
vision-language reasoning and are emerging as a foundation for cross-modal
intelligence. Hallucination remains a persistent failure mode, manifesting
itself as erroneous reasoning chains and misinterpretation of visual content.
In this study, we observe that attention heads exhibit a staged division:
shallow heads predominantly serve perception, while deeper heads shift toward
symbolic reasoning, revealing two major causes of hallucination, namely
perceptual bias and reasoning drift. To address these issues, we propose a
lightweight and interpretable two-step plugin, Functional Head Identification
and Class-conditioned Rescaling, which locates perception- and
reasoning-oriented heads and regulates their contributions without retraining.
Evaluations on three real-world MLRMs (Kimi-VL, Ocean-R1, R1-Onevision), six
benchmarks across three domains, and four baselines show that our plugin
achieves an average improvement of 5% and up to 15%, with only <1% additional
computation and 9% of baseline latency. Our approach is completely
model-agnostic and significantly enhances both the reliability and
interpretability of the off-the-shelf MLRMs, thereby enabling their safe
deployment in high-stakes applications. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Airbnb客服操作的复杂性，提高大语言模型在客服支持中的应用效果

Method: 采用Intent、Context、Action(ICA)格式重构策略和工作流程，开发合成数据生成策略进行低成本微调

Result: 内部实验显示该方法显著提升模型性能，在准确性和人工处理时间评估指标上都有改善

Conclusion: 该方法不仅成本效益高，还改善了客服支持质量，为大语言模型在客服领域的应用设立了新标杆

Abstract: We propose a practical approach by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs)
with a framework designed to navigate the complexities of Airbnb customer
support operations. In this paper, our methodology employs a novel reformatting
technique, the Intent, Context, and Action (ICA) format, which transforms
policies and workflows into a structure more comprehensible to LLMs.
Additionally, we develop a synthetic data generation strategy to create
training data with minimal human intervention, enabling cost-effective
fine-tuning of our model. Our internal experiments (not applied to Airbnb
products) demonstrate that our approach of restructuring workflows and
fine-tuning LLMs with synthetic data significantly enhances their performance,
setting a new benchmark for their application in customer support. Our solution
is not only cost-effective but also improves customer support, as evidenced by
both accuracy and manual processing time evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了"包容性创新红利"概念，论证了为多样化、受限使用场景设计的医疗AI解决方案能在更广泛市场中产生更优经济回报，并开发了HAIIF评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然医疗AI公平性的伦理论证已很充分，但包容性设计的经济和战略价值仍未得到充分探索。作者旨在展示包容性医疗AI开发如何创造超越合规要求的商业价值。

Method: 借鉴辅助技术发展为主流产业的案例，提出包容性创新红利的四个机制，并开发了医疗AI包容性创新框架(HAIIF)评分系统来评估AI投资。

Result: 识别了包容性创新驱动回报的四个机制：市场扩张、风险缓解、性能红利和竞争优势，并提供了结构化指导来将公平性转化为战略差异化来源。

Conclusion: 渐进投资包容性设计的组织能实现市场扩张和持续竞争优势，而将其视为成本的组织将面临网络效应和数据优势积累带来的复合劣势。

Abstract: While ethical arguments for fairness in healthcare AI are well-established,
the economic and strategic value of inclusive design remains underexplored.
This perspective introduces the ``inclusive innovation dividend'' -- the
counterintuitive principle that solutions engineered for diverse, constrained
use cases generate superior economic returns in broader markets. Drawing from
assistive technologies that evolved into billion-dollar mainstream industries,
we demonstrate how inclusive healthcare AI development creates business value
beyond compliance requirements. We identify four mechanisms through which
inclusive innovation drives returns: (1) market expansion via geographic
scalability and trust acceleration; (2) risk mitigation through reduced
remediation costs and litigation exposure; (3) performance dividends from
superior generalization and reduced technical debt, and (4) competitive
advantages in talent acquisition and clinical adoption. We present the
Healthcare AI Inclusive Innovation Framework (HAIIF), a practical scoring
system that enables organizations to evaluate AI investments based on their
potential to capture these benefits. HAIIF provides structured guidance for
resource allocation, transforming fairness and inclusivity from regulatory
checkboxes into sources of strategic differentiation. Our findings suggest that
organizations investing incrementally in inclusive design can achieve expanded
market reach and sustained competitive advantages, while those treating these
considerations as overhead face compounding disadvantages as network effects
and data advantages accrue to early movers.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 推理轨迹长度是大型推理模型中简单有效的置信度估计器，与零样本置信度估计方法表现相当但互补。推理后训练改变了轨迹长度与准确性的关系，增强了不确定性量化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM幻觉问题，提升其可靠部署能力，需要有效的不确定性量化方法。

Method: 通过多模型、多数据集、多提示的综合实验，研究推理轨迹长度作为置信度估计器的性能，分析推理后训练对轨迹长度与准确性关系的影响机制。

Result: 轨迹长度在置信度估计方面表现与语言化置信度相当但互补，推理后训练增强了不确定性量化能力，高熵或"分叉"token在机制中起关键作用。

Conclusion: 推理轨迹长度是大型推理模型的实用置信度度量，推理后训练超越了语言表达，增强了不确定性量化能力。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification for LLMs is a key research direction towards
addressing hallucination and other issues that limit their reliable deployment.
In this work, we show that reasoning trace length is a simple and useful
confidence estimator in large reasoning models. Through comprehensive
experiments across multiple models, datasets, and prompts, we show that trace
length performs in comparable but complementary ways to other zero-shot
confidence estimators such as verbalized confidence. Our work reveals that
reasoning post-training fundamentally alters the relationship between trace
length and accuracy, going beyond prior work that had shown that post-training
causes traces to grow longer in general (e.g., "overthinking"). We investigate
the mechanisms behind trace length's performance as a confidence signal,
observing that the effect remains even after adjusting for confounders such as
problem difficulty and GRPO-induced length bias. We identify high-entropy or
"forking" tokens as playing a key role in the mechanism. Our findings
demonstrate that reasoning post-training enhances uncertainty quantification
beyond verbal expressions, and establish trace length as a practical confidence
measure for large reasoning models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Traj-CoA是一个用于患者轨迹建模的多智能体系统，通过链式智能体处理电子健康记录数据，使用共享记忆模块减少噪声并保持时间线完整性，在肺癌风险预测任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在建模患者轨迹方面具有通用性，但面临电子健康记录数据长且噪声多的问题，在时间推理方面存在挑战。

Method: 采用多智能体系统，包括一系列工作智能体按顺序处理EHR数据块，将关键事件提取到共享长期记忆模块EHRMem中，最后由管理者智能体综合总结信息进行预测。

Result: 在基于五年EHR数据的零样本一年肺癌风险预测任务中，Traj-CoA优于四类基线方法，表现出临床对齐的时间推理能力。

Conclusion: Traj-CoA为建模复杂患者轨迹提供了一个稳健且可推广的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a generalizable approach for modeling
patient trajectories, but suffer from the long and noisy nature of electronic
health records (EHR) data in temporal reasoning. To address these challenges,
we introduce Traj-CoA, a multi-agent system involving chain-of-agents for
patient trajectory modeling. Traj-CoA employs a chain of worker agents to
process EHR data in manageable chunks sequentially, distilling critical events
into a shared long-term memory module, EHRMem, to reduce noise and preserve a
comprehensive timeline. A final manager agent synthesizes the worker agents'
summary and the extracted timeline in EHRMem to make predictions. In a
zero-shot one-year lung cancer risk prediction task based on five-year EHR
data, Traj-CoA outperforms baselines of four categories. Analysis reveals that
Traj-CoA exhibits clinically aligned temporal reasoning, establishing it as a
promisingly robust and generalizable approach for modeling complex patient
trajectories.

TL;DR: 提出MedCoAct多智能体框架，通过医生和药剂师智能体的协作，解决现有医疗AI在整合诊断和治疗决策方面的局限性，在诊断准确性和药物推荐准确性上分别比单智能体框架提升7.04%和7.08%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的医疗AI在孤立任务上表现良好，但在整合临床工作流程中连接诊断推理和药物决策时存在困难，缺乏临床团队中的交叉验证和知识整合。

Method: 提出MedCoAct置信感知多智能体框架，模拟临床协作，整合专门的医生和药剂师智能体，并创建DrugCareQA基准来评估医疗AI在整合诊断和治疗工作流程中的能力。

Result: MedCoAct达到67.58%的诊断准确性和67.58%的药物推荐准确性，分别比单智能体框架提升7.04%和7.08%，在远程医疗咨询和常规临床场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: 协作方法在不同医疗领域具有良好泛化能力，特别适用于远程医疗咨询和常规临床场景，同时提供可解释的决策路径。

Abstract: Autonomous agents utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in isolated medical tasks like diagnosis and image
analysis, but struggle with integrated clinical workflows that connect
diagnostic reasoning and medication decisions. We identify a core limitation:
existing medical AI systems process tasks in isolation without the
cross-validation and knowledge integration found in clinical teams, reducing
their effectiveness in real-world healthcare scenarios. To transform the
isolation paradigm into a collaborative approach, we propose MedCoAct, a
confidence-aware multi-agent framework that simulates clinical collaboration by
integrating specialized doctor and pharmacist agents, and present a benchmark,
DrugCareQA, to evaluate medical AI capabilities in integrated diagnosis and
treatment workflows. Our results demonstrate that MedCoAct achieves 67.58\%
diagnostic accuracy and 67.58\% medication recommendation accuracy,
outperforming single agent framework by 7.04\% and 7.08\% respectively. This
collaborative approach generalizes well across diverse medical domains, proving
especially effective for telemedicine consultations and routine clinical
scenarios, while providing interpretable decision-making pathways.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Latent-Trajectory信号，通过分析模型推理过程中内部表征的时间演化来预测推理路径的成功概率，显著提高了推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理模型通过增加计算资源来提高问题解决能力，但识别哪些推理路径可能成功是关键机会。可靠预测有效路径可以大幅减少计算浪费并提高整体效率。

Method: 引入Latent-Trajectory信号，通过测量推理开始和结束之间潜在表征的总体变化、中间步骤累积的变化以及这些变化向最终状态的推进程度，来预测解决方案的准确性。

Result: Latent-Trajectory信号比跨层指标和基于输出的置信度测量更可靠地预测解决方案准确性。在指导多个采样生成中的答案选择时，相比多数投票，将token使用量减少高达70%，同时平均准确率提高2.6%。

Conclusion: 这些发现不仅为推理时效率提供了实用策略，还从可解释性角度深入揭示了推理过程在潜在空间中的表示和区分方式。

Abstract: Reasoning models improve their problem-solving ability through inference-time
scaling, allocating more compute via longer token budgets. Identifying which
reasoning traces are likely to succeed remains a key opportunity: reliably
predicting productive paths can substantially reduce wasted computation and
improve overall efficiency. We introduce Latent-Trajectory signals that
characterize the temporal evolution of a model's internal representations
during the generation of intermediate reasoning tokens. By measuring the
overall change in latent representations between the start and end of
reasoning, the change accumulated across intermediate steps, and the extent to
which these changes advance toward the final state, we show that these signals
predict solution accuracy more reliably than both cross-layer metrics and
output-based confidence measures. When used to guide answer selection across
multiple sampled generations, Latent-Trajectory signals make test-time scaling
more effective and efficient than majority voting, reducing token usage by up
to 70% while preserving and even improving accuracy by 2.6% on average.
Moreover, these predictive signals often emerge early in the reasoning trace,
enabling early selection and allocation of compute to the most promising
candidates. Our findings contribute not only practical strategies for
inference-time efficiency, but also a deeper interpretability perspective on
how reasoning processes are represented and differentiated in latent space.

TL;DR: ELAIPBench是一个由领域专家策划的基准测试，用于评估大语言模型对AI研究论文的理解能力，包含403个多选问题，结果显示当前最佳LLM准确率仅为39.95%，远低于人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估LLM对学术论文的深度理解能力方面存在不足，要么问题设计过于表面，要么评估指标不可靠，因此需要开发更可靠的评估工具。

Method: 通过激励驱动的对抗性标注过程开发ELAIPBench基准，包含137篇论文的403个多选问题，涵盖三个难度级别，强调非平凡推理而非浅层检索。

Result: 实验显示最佳性能LLM准确率仅为39.95%，远低于人类表现。配备思维模式或RAG系统的前沿LLM未能改善结果，甚至因过度思考或噪声检索而降低准确率。

Conclusion: 当前LLM能力与真正理解学术论文之间存在显著差距，需要进一步研究来提升LLM的深度理解能力。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel at many domain-specific tasks, their
ability to deeply comprehend and reason about full-length academic papers
remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks often fall short of capturing such
depth, either due to surface-level question design or unreliable evaluation
metrics. To address this gap, we introduce ELAIPBench, a benchmark curated by
domain experts to evaluate LLMs' comprehension of artificial intelligence (AI)
research papers. Developed through an incentive-driven, adversarial annotation
process, ELAIPBench features 403 multiple-choice questions from 137 papers. It
spans three difficulty levels and emphasizes non-trivial reasoning rather than
shallow retrieval. Our experiments show that the best-performing LLM achieves
an accuracy of only 39.95%, far below human performance. Moreover, we observe
that frontier LLMs equipped with a thinking mode or a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) system fail to improve final results-even harming accuracy due
to overthinking or noisy retrieval. These findings underscore the significant
gap between current LLM capabilities and genuine comprehension of academic
papers.

### [408] [A Layered Intuition -- Method Model with Scope Extension for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10592)

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的直觉-方法分层模型，通过范围扩展来系统性地解决LLM中的间接问题，并首次引入时空扩展，构建知识网络，同时提出方法扩展熵来量化评估系统解决未知问题的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究已引入基于方法的推理和范围扩展来提升LLM性能，但缺乏系统性整合。本文旨在将这些思想统一成一个更系统化的框架，以更好地解决间接（未见）问题。

Method: 提出直觉-方法分层模型：直觉思维提供快速初步答案，方法思维将问题与解决方案解耦为可转移的推理单元。通过垂直（因果分析）、水平（平行和泛化问题）以及首次引入的时空扩展来扩大适用范围，并组织成系统化的知识树网络。

Result: 构建了一个更适应性的知识网络框架，能够通过系统化的扩展方法处理更广泛的问题类型，特别是间接和未见问题。

Conclusion: 通过逻辑连接现有方法并引入新的扩展维度，结合基于熵的评估框架，这项工作推进了LLM在现实问题解决中更鲁棒和可扩展的推理范式。

Abstract: Existing studies have introduced method-based reasoning and scope extension
as approaches to enhance Large Language Model (LLM) performance beyond direct
matrix mappings. Building on these foundations, this paper summarizes and
integrates these ideas into a unified Intuition-Method Layered Model with Scope
Extension, designed to address indirected (unseen) issues more systematically.
In this framework, intuition-based thinking provides rapid first-reaction
answers, while method-based thinking decouples questions and solutions into
transferable reasoning units. Scope extension is then applied to broaden
applicability, including vertical (cause analysis), horizontal (parallel and
generalized issues), and for the first time, temporal and spatial extensions,
which expand reasoning across time and contextual dimensions. These extensions
are organized into systematic knowledge trees that interconnect into a
knowledge network, thereby increasing adaptability. To quantitatively evaluate
this process, we propose the entropy of method extension, which measures the
independence and diversity of extensions as an indicator of the system's
capacity to solve unseen questions. By logically connecting existing approaches
with new extensions and introducing an entropy-based evaluation framework, this
work advances toward a more robust and extensible reasoning paradigm for LLMs
in real-world problem-solving.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于累积Jaccard指数的随机置换集距离度量方法，该方法具有自然的高权重特性，能够克服现有方法的不足，并具有更高的敏感性和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机置换集是表示有序结构不确定信息的新框架，测量置换质量函数之间的距离是RPS理论的关键研究课题。本文从随机有限集和可转移信念模型两个不同视角深入分析RPS之间的距离。

Method: 采用RPS的层-2信念结构解释，将RPST视为TBM的细化。从置换出发引入累积Jaccard指数的新定义来量化两个置换之间的相似性，并基于累积Jaccard指数矩阵提出RPS的距离度量方法。

Result: 研究了所提距离度量的度量和结构特性，包括累积Jaccard指数矩阵的正定性分析，并提供了修正方案。实验结果表明该方法克服了现有方法的缺点，与Jousselme距离兼容，且具有更高的敏感性和灵活性。

Conclusion: 提出的基于累积Jaccard指数的RPS距离度量方法具有自然的高权重特性，决策者可以通过调整权重和截断深度两个参数来定制距离度量，在数值实验中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Random permutation set (RPS) is a recently proposed framework designed to
represent order-structured uncertain information. Measuring the distance
between permutation mass functions is a key research topic in RPS theory
(RPST). This paper conducts an in-depth analysis of distances between RPSs from
two different perspectives: random finite set (RFS) and transferable belief
model (TBM). Adopting the layer-2 belief structure interpretation of RPS, we
regard RPST as a refinement of TBM, where the order in the ordered focus set
represents qualitative propensity. Starting from the permutation, we introduce
a new definition of the cumulative Jaccard index to quantify the similarity
between two permutations and further propose a distance measure method for RPSs
based on the cumulative Jaccard index matrix. The metric and structural
properties of the proposed distance measure are investigated, including the
positive definiteness analysis of the cumulative Jaccard index matrix, and a
correction scheme is provided. The proposed method has a natural
top-weightiness property: inconsistencies between higher-ranked elements tend
to result in greater distance values. Two parameters are provided to the
decision-maker to adjust the weight and truncation depth. Several numerical
examples are used to compare the proposed method with the existing method. The
experimental results show that the proposed method not only overcomes the
shortcomings of the existing method and is compatible with the Jousselme
distance, but also has higher sensitivity and flexibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 梯度优化方法对硬件要求严格，需要高并发、高内存的GPU，且要求所有神经网络操作可微分，排除了许多有前景的不可微分架构。

Method: 使用进化算法优化大语言模型，开发了EA4LLM方法，从预训练阶段成功训练10亿参数模型。

Result: 通过大量实验验证了进化算法有效优化神经网络的能力，提供了关键见解。

Conclusion: 该方法有望降低大语言模型训练的计算成本，使计算资源有限的群体能够参与深度学习研究。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress,
with model optimization primarily relying on gradient-based optimizers such as
Adam. However, these gradient-based methods impose stringent hardware
requirements, demanding high-concurrency, high-memory GPUs. Moreover, they
require all neural network operations to be differentiable, thereby excluding
many promising non-differentiable architectures from practical use. To address
these limitations, we propose a method for optimizing LLMs using evolutionary
algorithms (EA4LLM) and, for the first time, successfully demonstrate its
capability to train a 1-billion-parameter LLM from the pre-trained stage. We
conduct extensive experiments and provide key insights into how evolutionary
algorithms can effectively optimize neural networks. Our work challenges the
prevailing assumption that gradient-based optimization is the only viable
approach for training neural networks. It also holds significant potential to
reduce the computational cost of training large language models, thereby
enabling groups with limited computational resources to participate in deep
learning research.

Motivation: 解决多模态文本到图像生成中语义对齐和专业细节保持的困难，特别是在多样化视觉领域中

Method: 多智能体强化学习框架，包含文本增强和图像生成两个耦合子系统，使用PPO训练，复合奖励函数平衡语义相似性、视觉质量和内容多样性，通过对比学习、双向注意力和迭代反馈加强跨模态对齐

Result: 在六个实验设置中显著丰富生成内容（词数增加1614%），ROUGE-1分数降低69.7%，基于Transformer的融合策略获得最高综合得分（0.521），多模态集成产生中等一致性（0.444-0.481）

Conclusion: 协作式、专业化驱动的架构在推进可靠多模态生成系统方面具有前景，但跨模态语义基础仍面临持续挑战

Abstract: Multimodal text-to-image generation remains constrained by the difficulty of
maintaining semantic alignment and professional-level detail across diverse
visual domains. We propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that
coordinates domain-specialized agents (e.g., focused on architecture,
portraiture, and landscape imagery) within two coupled subsystems: a text
enhancement module and an image generation module, each augmented with
multimodal integration components. Agents are trained using Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) under a composite reward function that balances semantic
similarity, linguistic visual quality, and content diversity. Cross-modal
alignment is enforced through contrastive learning, bidirectional attention,
and iterative feedback between text and image. Across six experimental
settings, our system significantly enriches generated content (word count
increased by 1614%) while reducing ROUGE-1 scores by 69.7%. Among fusion
methods, Transformer-based strategies achieve the highest composite score
(0.521), despite occasional stability issues. Multimodal ensembles yield
moderate consistency (ranging from 0.444 to 0.481), reflecting the persistent
challenges of cross-modal semantic grounding. These findings underscore the
promise of collaborative, specialization-driven architectures for advancing
reliable multimodal generative systems.

Motivation: 虽然学生满意度已被广泛研究，但可解释机器学习和神经网络等现代技术尚未充分探索。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用结合提升方法和可解释性的自动分段线性回归(APLR)模型，与其他先进方法进行比较分析。

Result: APLR模型提供了最佳拟合效果，通过数值和可视化解释识别出影响学习满意度的关键因素。

Conclusion: APLR模型能够提供个体层面的因素解释，使教育者能够根据学生特征定制教学方案。

Abstract: Although student learning satisfaction has been widely studied, modern
techniques such as interpretable machine learning and neural networks have not
been sufficiently explored. This study demonstrates that a recent model that
combines boosting with interpretability, automatic piecewise linear
regression(APLR), offers the best fit for predicting learning satisfaction
among several state-of-the-art approaches. Through the analysis of APLR's
numerical and visual interpretations, students' time management and
concentration abilities, perceived helpfulness to classmates, and participation
in offline courses have the most significant positive impact on learning
satisfaction. Surprisingly, involvement in creative activities did not
positively affect learning satisfaction. Moreover, the contributing factors can
be interpreted on an individual level, allowing educators to customize
instructions according to student profiles.

Conclusion: 所提出的LLM与数学优化结合的混合框架有效解决了在线叫车平台的供需平衡问题，克服了现有方法的局限性，实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Online ride-hailing platforms aim to deliver efficient mobility-on-demand
services, often facing challenges in balancing dynamic and spatially
heterogeneous supply and demand. Existing methods typically fall into two
categories: reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, which suffer from data
inefficiency, oversimplified modeling of real-world dynamics, and difficulty
enforcing operational constraints; or decomposed online optimization methods,
which rely on manually designed high-level objectives that lack awareness of
low-level routing dynamics. To address this issue, we propose a novel hybrid
framework that integrates large language model (LLM) with mathematical
optimization in a dynamic hierarchical system: (1) it is training-free,
removing the need for large-scale interaction data as in RL, and (2) it
leverages LLM to bridge cognitive limitations caused by problem decomposition
by adaptively generating high-level objectives. Within this framework, LLM
serves as a meta-optimizer, producing semantic heuristics that guide a
low-level optimizer responsible for constraint enforcement and real-time
decision execution. These heuristics are refined through a closed-loop
evolutionary process, driven by harmony search, which iteratively adapts the
LLM prompts based on feasibility and performance feedback from the optimization
layer. Extensive experiments based on scenarios derived from both the New York
and Chicago taxi datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
achieving an average improvement of 16% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Method: UCAS采用两阶段机制：首先使用模型的整体自信度调节响应级优势，然后基于原始logit确定性应用token级惩罚，鼓励探索高不确定性但能产生正确答案的路径。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试上的实验表明，UCAS在多个模型规模（包括1.5B和7B）上显著优于强RLVR基线，不仅获得更高奖励，还促进更大的推理多样性并成功缓解熵崩溃。

Conclusion: UCAS通过细粒度的不确定性感知优势塑造，有效平衡了探索与利用的权衡，提升了语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has shown significant
promise for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). However, prevailing algorithms like GRPO broadcast a uniform advantage
signal across all tokens in a sequence. This coarse-grained approach overlooks
the pivotal role of uncertain, high-stakes decisions during reasoning, leading
to inefficient exploration and the well-documented problem of entropy collapse.
To address this, we introduce UnCertainty-aware Advantage Shaping (UCAS), a
model-free method that refines credit assignment by leveraging the model's
internal uncertainty signals. UCAS operates in two stages: it first modulates
the response-level advantage using the model's overall self-confidence, and
then applies a token-level penalty based on raw logit certainty. This dual
mechanism encourages exploration of high-uncertainty paths that yield correct
answers while penalizing overconfident yet erroneous reasoning, effectively
balancing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Extensive experiments on five
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that UCAS significantly outperforms
strong RLVR baselines across multiple model scales, including 1.5B and 7B. Our
analysis confirms that UCAS not only achieves higher rewards but also promotes
greater reasoning diversity and successfully mitigates entropy collapse.

Abstract: Generative Agentic AI systems are emerging as a powerful paradigm for
automating complex, multi-step tasks. However, many existing frameworks for
building these systems introduce significant complexity, a steep learning
curve, and substantial boilerplate code, hindering rapid prototyping and
deployment. This paper introduces simpliflow, a lightweight, open-source Python
framework designed to address these challenges. simpliflow enables the rapid
development and orchestration of linear, deterministic agentic workflows
through a declarative, JSON-based configuration. Its modular architecture
decouples agent management, workflow execution, and post-processing, promoting
ease of use and extensibility. By integrating with LiteLLM, it supports over
100 Large Language Models (LLMs) out-of-the-box. We present the architecture,
operational flow, and core features of simpliflow, demonstrating its utility
through diverse use cases ranging from software development simulation to
real-time system interaction. A comparative analysis with prominent frameworks
like LangChain and AutoGen highlights simpliflow's unique position as a tool
optimized for simplicity, control, and speed in deterministic workflow
environments.

TL;DR: 提出了OmniVideoBench基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型在音视频协同理解方面的能力，包含1000个高质量问答对和13种问题类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法全面评估音视频模态的协同推理能力，往往忽视其中一个模态或以逻辑不一致的方式整合它们。

Method: 构建包含1000个问答对的大规模基准，这些问答对来自628个多样化视频，每个问题都带有逐步推理轨迹，并手动验证确保正确性和唯一性。

Result: 多个MLLM在OmniVideoBench上的评估显示模型性能与人类推理之间存在显著差距，开源模型明显落后于闭源模型。

Conclusion: OmniVideoBench将公开发布，以促进具有更强和更通用推理能力的MLLM的发展，突显了真正音视频推理的内在难度。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
substantial potential in video understanding. However, existing benchmarks fail
to comprehensively evaluate synergistic reasoning capabilities across audio and
visual modalities, often neglecting either one of the modalities or integrating
them in a logically inconsistent manner. To bridge this gap, we introduce
OmniVideoBench, a large-scale and rigorously designed benchmark dedicated to
assessing synergistic audio-visual understanding, with a strong emphasis on
modality complementarity and logical consistency. Specifically, OmniVideoBench
comprises 1000 high-quality question-answer(QA) pairs, each annotated with
step-by-step reasoning traces, derived from 628 diverse videos ranging from
several seconds to 30 minutes, and manually verified to guarantee complete
correctness and uniqueness. Moreover, OmniVideoBench encompasses 13 carefully
designed question types, covering temporal reasoning, spatial localization,
counting, causal inference, summarization, and beyond, thereby capturing the
essential challenges of video understanding. Evaluation of multiple MLLMs on
OmniVideoBench reveals a pronounced gap between model performance and human
reasoning, with open-source models lagging significantly behind their
closed-source counterparts, underscoring the inherent difficulty of genuine
audio-visual reasoning. We will release OmniVideoBench to foster the
development of MLLMs with stronger and more generalizable reasoning
capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推理演算基于二元归结，限制了多子句之间的演绎协同作用。虽然CSE框架提出了动态多子句推理理论，但其算法实现尚未形式化。

Method: 开发了扩展三角方法(ETM)，在三角几何框架中形式化矛盾分离的内部机制，支持灵活的子句交互和动态协同。

Result: ETM作为多个高性能定理证明器(CSE, CSE-E, CSI-E, CSI-Enig)的核心算法，在TPTP问题集和CASC 2018-2015标准基准测试中取得了有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: ETM将矛盾分离范式推进为通用、可扩展且具有实际竞争力的自动推理模型，为逻辑推理和定理证明的未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Automated deduction lies at the core of Artificial Intelligence (AI),
underpinning theorem proving, formal verification, and logical reasoning.
Despite decades of progress, reconciling deductive completeness with
computational efficiency remains an enduring challenge. Traditional reasoning
calculi, grounded in binary resolution, restrict inference to pairwise clause
interactions and thereby limit deductive synergy among multiple clauses. The
Contradiction Separation Extension (CSE) framework, introduced in 2018,
proposed a dynamic multi-clause reasoning theory that redefined logical
inference as a process of contradiction separation rather than sequential
resolution. While that work established the theoretical foundation, its
algorithmic realization remained unformalized and unpublished. This work
presents the Extended Triangular Method (ETM), a generalized
contradiction-construction algorithm that formalizes and extends the internal
mechanisms of contradiction separation. The ETM unifies multiple
contradiction-building strategies, including the earlier Standard Extension
method, within a triangular geometric framework that supports flexible clause
interaction and dynamic synergy. ETM serves as the algorithmic core of several
high-performance theorem provers, CSE, CSE-E, CSI-E, and CSI-Enig, whose
competitive results in standard first-order benchmarks (TPTP problem sets and
CASC 2018-2015) empirically validate the effectiveness and generality of the
proposed approach. By bridging theoretical abstraction and operational
implementation, ETM advances the contradiction separation paradigm into a
generalized, scalable, and practically competitive model for automated
reasoning, offering new directions for future research in logical inference and
theorem proving.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应选择符号语言的方法来改进LLMs的逻辑推理性能，通过为每个问题选择最适合的符号语言（一阶逻辑、逻辑编程或布尔可满足性）进行翻译，显著提升了推理准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在将自然语言问题翻译为符号语言时，只关注翻译准确性而忽略了目标符号语言类型本身的选择对推理性能的重要影响。不同逻辑推理问题对应不同的最优符号语言形式化方法。

Method: 利用LLMs自适应选择最适合的符号语言（一阶逻辑、逻辑编程或布尔可满足性），然后将自然语言问题翻译为目标符号语言表达式，并使用相应的逻辑求解器得出最终答案。

Result: 在基准测试中，自适应选择方法显著优于将所有问题翻译为单一符号语言或随机选择符号语言的方法。在混合数据集上达到96%的准确率，比一阶逻辑翻译的次高准确率提升了25%。

Conclusion: 不同自然语言逻辑推理问题对应不同的最优符号语言形式化方法，自适应选择目标符号语言能显著提升LLMs的逻辑推理性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with complex logical reasoning.
While previous works achieve remarkable improvements, their performance is
highly dependent on the correctness of translating natural language (NL)
problems into a symbolic language (SL). Though numerous works focusing on
improving this translation accuracy, they only consider the similarity between
the meaning of SL and NL, overlooking another crucial influencing factor, the
selection of the target SL type itself. For example, first-order logic language
specializes in logical reasoning with categorical syllogisms and complex
quantifiers, while Boolean satisfiability formalism excels at representing
constraint satisfaction like partial problems. To our knowledge, this is the
first paper to claim and verify that different NL logical reasoning problem
corresponds to different optimal SL formalization for translation. Based on
this, we propose a methods to improve the logical reasoning performance of LLMs
by adaptively selecting the most suitable SL for each problem prior to
translation. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to select the target SL among
first-order logic, logic programming and Boolean satisfiability and then
translate the problem in NL to target SL expressions as well as employ the
corresponding logical solver to derive the final answer. Experimental results
on benchmarks show that our adaptive selection method significantly outperforms
translating all into single SL and randomly selecting the SL. On a mixed
dataset of these benchmarks, our approach achieves 96% accuracy, which
improving performance by 25% compared to the second highest accuracy from the
first-order logic translation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文开发了一个框架来评估大型语言模型是否具备真正的战略思维能力，通过分析信念形成、行动评估和选择过程，发现前沿模型在特定推理深度下表现出信念一致的最佳响应行为，并展现出元推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要评估LLMs在均衡策略或推理深度方面的表现，但尚未探索它们是否具备真正的战略思维能力——即对其他智能体形成一致信念、评估可能行动并基于这些信念做出选择的能力。

Method: 开发了一个框架，在静态完全信息博弈中分离信念、评估和选择过程，通过分析模型的显性选择和推理轨迹，并引入新的上下文无关博弈来排除记忆模仿的影响。

Result: 当前前沿模型在目标推理深度下表现出信念一致的最佳响应行为；在无约束条件下会自我限制推理深度，并对人类和合成对手形成差异化推测；随着复杂性增加，显式递归让位于内部生成的启发式选择规则，这些规则稳定、模型特定且不同于已知的人类偏见。

Conclusion: 信念一致性、元推理和新颖启发式形成可以从语言建模目标中联合涌现，为研究人工智能体的战略认知提供了结构化基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to domains that require
reasoning about other agents' behavior, such as negotiation, policy design, and
market simulation, yet existing research has mostly evaluated their adherence
to equilibrium play or their exhibited depth of reasoning. Whether they display
genuine strategic thinking, understood as the coherent formation of beliefs
about other agents, evaluation of possible actions, and choice based on those
beliefs, remains unexplored. We develop a framework to identify this ability by
disentangling beliefs, evaluation, and choice in static, complete-information
games, and apply it across a series of non-cooperative environments. By jointly
analyzing models' revealed choices and reasoning traces, and introducing a new
context-free game to rule out imitation from memorization, we show that current
frontier models exhibit belief-coherent best-response behavior at targeted
reasoning depths. When unconstrained, they self-limit their depth of reasoning
and form differentiated conjectures about human and synthetic opponents,
revealing an emergent form of meta-reasoning. Under increasing complexity,
explicit recursion gives way to internally generated heuristic rules of choice
that are stable, model-specific, and distinct from known human biases. These
findings indicate that belief coherence, meta-reasoning, and novel heuristic
formation can emerge jointly from language modeling objectives, providing a
structured basis for the study of strategic cognition in artificial agents.

TL;DR: DRIFT框架通过将非正式数学陈述分解为更小的子组件，改进了LLMs在定理证明中的前提检索能力，显著提升了自动形式化的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在数学自动形式化中难以识别和利用先验数学知识的问题，传统检索方法因非正式数学陈述的复杂性而效果有限。

Method: 引入DRIFT框架，将非正式数学陈述分解为子组件，进行针对性前提检索，并获取示例定理以帮助模型更有效地使用前提。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升前提检索性能，ProofNet上F1分数几乎翻倍，在ConNF基准上BEq+@10分别提升37.14%和42.25%。

Conclusion: 数学自动形式化中的检索效果高度依赖模型特定的知识边界，需要与模型能力相匹配的自适应检索策略。

Abstract: Automating the formalization of mathematical statements for theorem proving
remains a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs struggle to
identify and utilize the prerequisite mathematical knowledge and its
corresponding formal representation in languages like Lean. Current
retrieval-augmented autoformalization methods query external libraries using
the informal statement directly, but overlook a fundamental limitation:
informal mathematical statements are often complex and offer limited context on
the underlying math concepts. To address this, we introduce DRIFT, a novel
framework that enables LLMs to decompose informal mathematical statements into
smaller, more tractable ''sub-components''. This facilitates targeted retrieval
of premises from mathematical libraries such as Mathlib. Additionally, DRIFT
retrieves illustrative theorems to help models use premises more effectively in
formalization tasks. We evaluate DRIFT across diverse benchmarks (ProofNet,
ConNF, and MiniF2F-test) and find that it consistently improves premise
retrieval, nearly doubling the F1 score compared to the DPR baseline on
ProofNet. Notably, DRIFT demonstrates strong performance on the
out-of-distribution ConNF benchmark, with BEq+@10 improvements of 37.14% and
42.25% using GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1, respectively. Our analysis shows that
retrieval effectiveness in mathematical autoformalization depends heavily on
model-specific knowledge boundaries, highlighting the need for adaptive
retrieval strategies aligned with each model's capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究具身AI中出现的神经症行为模式，这些行为虽然内部逻辑一致但与现实环境不匹配，可能导致系统性能下降和安全风险。

Method: 在网格导航系统中识别了多种神经症模式，开发了轻量级在线检测器和可重用的逃逸策略，并提出基于遗传编程的破坏性测试方法来最大化神经症评分。

Result: 成功识别了12种神经症行为模式，开发了有效的检测和逃逸机制，并展示了即使在完全可见情况下，习得的厌恶成本仍会导致持久的恐惧回避行为。

Conclusion: 局部修复不足以解决全局性故障，需要采用破坏性测试方法来暴露系统架构层面的问题，而不仅仅是症状级别的修补。

Abstract: We present a framework for characterizing neurosis in embodied AI: behaviors
that are internally coherent yet misaligned with reality, arising from
interactions among planning, uncertainty handling, and aversive memory. In a
grid navigation stack we catalogue recurrent modalities including flip-flop,
plan churn, perseveration loops, paralysis and hypervigilance, futile search,
belief incoherence, tie break thrashing, corridor thrashing, optimality
compulsion, metric mismatch, policy oscillation, and limited-visibility
variants. For each we give lightweight online detectors and reusable escape
policies (short commitments, a margin to switch, smoothing, principled
arbitration). We then show that durable phobic avoidance can persist even under
full visibility when learned aversive costs dominate local choice, producing
long detours despite globally safe routes. Using First/Second/Third Law as
engineering shorthand for safety latency, command compliance, and resource
efficiency, we argue that local fixes are insufficient; global failures can
remain. To surface them, we propose genetic-programming based destructive
testing that evolves worlds and perturbations to maximize law pressure and
neurosis scores, yielding adversarial curricula and counterfactual traces that
expose where architectural revision, not merely symptom-level patches, is
required.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MAC协议需要手动配置，而基于深度强化学习的协议虽然能提升特定任务性能，但泛化性和鲁棒性差，需要昂贵的重新训练来适应动态环境。

Method: 将基站与用户设备的上行传输建模为动态多跟随者Stackelberg博弈，使用LLM驱动的智能体通过近端策略优化协调生成自适应语义MAC协议，并采用协议动作语法确保过程可靠性。

Result: 仿真验证该框架比传统基线方法提升77.6%的吞吐量和65.2%的公平性，且能很好地泛化到波动用户数量而无需重新训练或架构改变。

Conclusion: 该LLM赋能的博弈论多智能体强化学习框架能够有效解决MAC协议的自适应和泛化问题，在动态无线网络环境中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols, essential for wireless networks, are
typically manually configured. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based
protocols enhance task-specified network performance, they suffer from poor
generalizability and resilience, demanding costly retraining to adapt to
dynamic environments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
game-theoretic LLM-empowered multi-agent DRL (MARL) framework, in which the
uplink transmission between a base station and a varying number of user
equipments is modeled as a dynamic multi-follower Stackelberg game (MFSG),
capturing the network's natural hierarchical structure. Within this game,
LLM-driven agents, coordinated through proximal policy optimization (PPO),
synthesize adaptive, semantic MAC protocols in response to network dynamics.
Protocol action grammar (PAG) is employed to ensure the reliability and
efficiency of this process. Under this system, we further analyze the existence
and convergence behavior in terms of a Stackelberg equilibrium by studying the
learning dynamics of LLM-empowered unified policies in response to changing
followers. Simulations corroborate that our framework achieves a 77.6% greater
throughput and a 65.2% fairness improvement over conventional baselines.
Besides, our framework generalizes excellently to a fluctuating number of users
without requiring retraining or architectural changes.

Method: 构建了模块化可扩展的平台，提供多模态解析、上下文检索和程序化计算等工具，评估智能体整合多篇论文信息回答研究问题的能力。

Result: 最先进的LLM智能体系统平均准确率仅为38.78%，在困难子集上降至18.47%，且所有测试智能体都表现出工具使用效率低下的问题。

Conclusion: PaperArena揭示了当前智能体在科学发现任务中的显著不足，邀请社区采用该基准来开发更强大的科学发现智能体。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning on the web-scale scientific literature is a
crucial touchstone for large language model (LLM) based agents designed to
support complex knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing works are mainly
restricted to tool-free tasks within isolated papers, largely due to the lack
of a benchmark for cross-paper reasoning and multi-tool orchestration in real
research scenarios. In this work, we propose PaperArena, an evaluation
benchmark for agents to address real-world research questions that typically
require integrating information across multiple papers with the assistance of
external tools. Given a research question, agents should integrate diverse
formats across multiple papers through reasoning and interacting with
appropriate tools, thereby producing a well-grounded answer. To support
standardized evaluation, we provide a modular and extensible platform for agent
execution, offering tools such as multimodal parsing, context retrieval, and
programmatic computation. Experimental results reveal that even the most
advanced LLM powering a well-established agent system achieves merely 38.78%
average accuracy. On the hard subset, accuracy drops to only 18.47%,
highlighting great potential for improvement. We also present several empirical
findings, including that all agents tested exhibit inefficient tool usage,
often invoking more tools than necessary to solve a task. We invite the
community to adopt PaperArena to develop and evaluate more capable agents for
scientific discovery. Our code and data are available

TL;DR: 提出Proof-of-Use (PoU)框架解决RAG代理中的工具调用黑客问题，通过证据基础的强化学习确保检索证据与推理过程之间的因果联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别RAG代理中的工具调用黑客失败模式，即代理通过表面正确的工具调用来夸大奖励信号，而不真正利用检索证据，导致模式崩溃和虚假基础。

Method: PoU框架通过统一的逐步合约实现，结合语法引用验证、基于扰动的敏感性奖励和答案-证据对齐目标，确保工具使用的可解释性和功能性基础。

Result: 在七个QA基准测试中，PoU在事实准确性、证据忠实度和工具路由平衡方面持续优于DeepResearch基线。

Conclusion: 强调需要将RL训练代理不仅基于任务结果，还要基于检索信息的因果使用，为可信的检索增强推理提供原则性路径。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) agents, such as recent
DeepResearch-style systems, extend large language models (LLMs) with autonomous
information-seeking capabilities through external tools. While reinforcement
learning (RL) has enabled impressive multi-step reasoning, we identify a
previously overlooked failure mode, Tool-Call Hacking, where agents inflate
reward signals by issuing superficially correct tool calls without genuinely
leveraging the retrieved evidence. This results in (i) mode collapse into
repetitive reliance on a single source and (ii) spurious grounding, where
answers are only weakly supported by cited content.
  To address this, we propose Proof-of-Use (PoU), an evidence-grounded RL
framework that enforces verifiable causal links between retrieved evidence,
reasoning traces, and final answers. PoU operationalizes this through a unified
step-wise contract combining syntactic citation validation, perturbation-based
sensitivity rewards, and answer-evidence alignment objectives, ensuring that
tool usage remains both interpretable and functionally grounded.
  Across seven QA benchmarks spanning in-domain, out-of-domain, and
out-of-tool-distribution settings, PoU consistently outperforms strong
DeepResearch baselines in factual accuracy, evidence faithfulness, and
tool-routing balance. These findings highlight the necessity of grounding
RL-trained agents not merely in task outcomes but in the causal use of
retrieved information, offering a principled path toward trustworthy
retrieval-augmented reasoning.

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合图构建、混合推理和交互式可视化，为企业环境中的智能知识助手提供了可扩展、可解释和以用户为中心的基础。

Abstract: Modern enterprises manage vast knowledge distributed across heterogeneous
systems such as Jira, Git repositories, Confluence, and wikis. Conventional
retrieval methods based on keyword search or static embeddings often fail to
answer complex queries that require contextual reasoning and multi-hop
inference across artifacts. We present a modular hybrid retrieval framework for
adaptive enterprise information access that integrates Knowledge Base
Language-Augmented Models (KBLam), DeepGraph representations, and
embedding-driven semantic search. The framework builds a unified knowledge
graph from parsed repositories including code, pull requests, and commit
histories, enabling semantic similarity search, structural inference, and
multi-hop reasoning. Query analysis dynamically determines the optimal
retrieval strategy, supporting both structured and unstructured data sources
through independent or fused processing. An interactive interface provides
graph visualizations, subgraph exploration, and context-aware query routing to
generate concise and explainable answers. Experiments on large-scale Git
repositories show that the unified reasoning layer improves answer relevance by
up to 80 percent compared with standalone GPT-based retrieval pipelines. By
combining graph construction, hybrid reasoning, and interactive visualization,
the proposed framework offers a scalable, explainable, and user-centric
foundation for intelligent knowledge assistants in enterprise environments.

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has demonstrated
strong semantic understanding capabilities, but struggles to perform precise
spatio-temporal understanding. Existing spatio-temporal methods primarily focus
on the video itself, while overlooking the physical information within the
video, such as multi-object layouts and motion. Such limitations restrict the
use of MLLMs in downstream applications that demand high precision, including
embodied intelligence and VR. To address this issue, we present Video-STR, a
novel graph-based reinforcement method for precise Video Spatio-Temporal
Reasoning. Building upon the capacity of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Reward (RLVR) to improve model abilities, we introduce a reasoning mechanism
using graph-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) method to guide the
model in inferring the underlying spatio-temporal topology of scenarios during
the thinking process. To resolve the lack of spatio-temporal training data, we
construct the STV-205k dataset with 205k question-answering pairs, covering
dynamic multi-object scenes in both indoor and outdoor environments, to support
the model training. Experiments show that Video-STR achieves state-of-the-art
results on various benchmarks, outperforming the base model by 13% on
STI-Bench, and demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and dataset.
Code, model, and data will be released.

*Taiqiang Wu,Runming Yang,Tao Liu,Jiahao Wang,Ngai Wong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文系统性地重新审视了最简单的模型合并方法——直接插值两个模型的权重，发现模型插值遵循三阶段演化范式，并提供了性能-成本权衡的原则性指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型合并（特别是在Instruct和Thinking模型上）已显示出高效推理的显著性能，但需要更深入理解最简单的权重插值方法的工作原理和潜力。

Method: 采用直接权重插值的模型合并方法，通过系统观察模型插值在推理轨迹上的三阶段演化行为，为性能-成本权衡提供原则性指导。

Result: 实验结果表明，策略性插值的模型在效率和效果上都超过了复杂的模型合并基线方法，并通过广泛的消融研究验证了发现。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了模型插值的内在机制，并为构建具有精确目标推理能力的模型提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Model merging, typically on Instruct and Thinking models, has shown
remarkable performance for efficient reasoning. In this paper, we
systematically revisit the simplest merging method that interpolates two
weights directly. Particularly, we observe that model interpolation follows a
three-stage evolutionary paradigm with distinct behaviors on the reasoning
trajectory. These dynamics provide a principled guide for navigating the
performance-cost trade-off. Empirical results demonstrate that a strategically
interpolated model surprisingly surpasses sophisticated model merging baselines
on both efficiency and effectiveness. We further validate our findings with
extensive ablation studies on model layers, modules, and decoding strategies.
Ultimately, this work demystifies model interpolation and offers a practical
framework for crafting models with precisely targeted reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出基于诊断知识本体和FBS模型的维护记录积累方法，用于制造系统中的故障原因推断，在专家候选原因匹配方面表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在制造系统中识别故障原因对维持和提高生产效率至关重要，需要知识库能够明确结构化系统知识和故障知识，并包含足够长的故障因果链。

Method: 构建诊断知识本体，提出基于功能-行为-结构(FBS)模型的维护记录积累方法。

Result: 使用该方法积累的维护记录进行故障原因推断，与专家枚举的候选原因集有更好的一致性，特别是在相关案例少、词汇差异大的困难情况下。

Conclusion: 该方法利用设计阶段对目标的理解和知识来支持维护阶段的知识积累和问题解决，有望成为未来整个工程链知识共享的基础。

Abstract: In manufacturing systems, identifying the causes of failures is crucial for
maintaining and improving production efficiency. In knowledge-based
failure-cause inference, it is important that the knowledge base (1) explicitly
structures knowledge about the target system and about failures, and (2)
contains sufficiently long causal chains of failures. In this study, we
constructed Diagnostic Knowledge Ontology and proposed a
Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) model-based maintenance-record accumulation
method based on it. Failure-cause inference using the maintenance records
accumulated by the proposed method showed better agreement with the set of
candidate causes enumerated by experts, especially in difficult cases where the
number of related cases is small and the vocabulary used differs. In the
future, it will be necessary to develop inference methods tailored to these
maintenance records, build a user interface, and carry out validation on larger
and more diverse systems. Additionally, this approach leverages the
understanding and knowledge of the target in the design phase to support
knowledge accumulation and problem solving during the maintenance phase, and it
is expected to become a foundation for knowledge sharing across the entire
engineering chain in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统在法律环境中的不透明性对公平性、问责制和信任构成挑战，黑盒问题削弱了自动化决策的合法性，因为受影响个体通常无法获得有意义的解释。

Method: 分析不同解释策略的优缺点，评估其在法律推理中的适用性，并强调论证框架通过捕捉法律的可废止性、可争议性和价值敏感性，为可解释法律AI提供了坚实基础。

Result: 论证框架能够更好地满足法律领域透明度的技术和规范要求，为法律AI系统提供更符合法律特性的解释机制。

Conclusion: 计算论证最适合满足法律领域透明度的技术和规范要求，但仍需解决偏见缓解、司法环境中的实证验证以及与不断发展的伦理和法律标准合规等开放挑战。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly deployed in legal
contexts, where their opacity raises significant challenges for fairness,
accountability, and trust. The so-called ``black box problem'' undermines the
legitimacy of automated decision-making, as affected individuals often lack
access to meaningful explanations. In response, the field of Explainable AI
(XAI) has proposed a variety of methods to enhance transparency, ranging from
example-based and rule-based techniques to hybrid and argumentation-based
approaches. This paper promotes computational models of arguments and their
role in providing legally relevant explanations, with particular attention to
their alignment with emerging regulatory frameworks such as the EU General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA). We
analyze the strengths and limitations of different explanation strategies,
evaluate their applicability to legal reasoning, and highlight how
argumentation frameworks -- by capturing the defeasible, contestable, and
value-sensitive nature of law -- offer a particularly robust foundation for
explainable legal AI. Finally, we identify open challenges and research
directions, including bias mitigation, empirical validation in judicial
settings, and compliance with evolving ethical and legal standards, arguing
that computational argumentation is best positioned to meet both technical and
normative requirements of transparency in the law domain.

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology,
socio-economic systems are entering a new stage of "human-AI co-creation."
Building upon a previously established multi-level intelligent agent economic
model, this paper conducts simulation-based comparisons of macroeconomic output
evolution in China and the United States under different mechanisms-AI
collaboration, network effects, and AI autonomous production. The results show
that: (1) when AI functions as an independent productive entity, the overall
growth rate of social output far exceeds that of traditional human-labor-based
models; (2) China demonstrates clear potential for acceleration in both the
expansion of intelligent agent populations and the pace of technological
catch-up, offering the possibility of achieving technological convergence or
even partial surpassing. This study provides a systematic, model-based
analytical framework for understanding AI-driven production system
transformation and shifts in international competitiveness, as well as
quantitative insights for relevant policy formulation.

Abstract: The steady growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has accelerated in the
recent years, facilitated by the development of sophisticated models such as
large language models and foundation models. Ensuring robust and reliable power
infrastructures is fundamental to take advantage of the full potential of AI.
However, AI data centres are extremely hungry for power, putting the problem of
their power management in the spotlight, especially with respect to their
impact on environment and sustainable development. In this work, we investigate
the capacity and limits of solutions based on an innovative approach for the
power management of AI data centres, i.e., making part of the input power as
dynamic as the power used for data-computing functions. The performance of
passive and active devices are quantified and compared in terms of
computational gain, energy efficiency, reduction of capital expenditure, and
management costs by analysing power trends from multiple data platforms
worldwide. This strategy, which identifies a paradigm shift in the AI data
centre power management, has the potential to strongly improve the
sustainability of AI hyperscalers, enhancing their footprint on environmental,
financial, and societal fields.

TL;DR: ARIA是一个基于规范驱动的自动化研究智能助手，通过六层架构实现可解释的数据分析，在保持高预测准确性的同时提供透明文档。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决科学数据快速增长与分析能力之间的差距，现有AI工具要么过度自动化缺乏透明度，要么依赖手动脚本影响可扩展性和可复现性。

Method: 采用六层互操作架构（命令、上下文、代码、数据、编排、AI模块）和文档中心工作流，通过自然语言规范定义分析目标，自动生成可执行代码并验证计算。

Result: 在波士顿房价案例中发现25个关键特征，确定XGBoost为最佳模型（R平方=0.93），过拟合最小。跨领域评估显示优于现有系统的性能、可解释性和效率。

Conclusion: ARIA通过将AI研究原则与科学原则结合在规范驱动架构中，建立了透明、协作和可复现科学发现的新范式。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of scientific data has widened the gap between analytical
capability and research intent. Existing AI-based analysis tools, ranging from
AutoML frameworks to agentic research assistants, either favor automation over
transparency or depend on manual scripting that hinders scalability and
reproducibility. We present ARIA (Automated Research Intelligence Assistant), a
spec-driven, human-in-the-loop framework for automated and interpretable data
analysis. ARIA integrates six interoperable layers, namely Command, Context,
Code, Data, Orchestration, and AI Module, within a document-centric workflow
that unifies human reasoning and machine execution. Through natural-language
specifications, researchers define analytical goals while ARIA autonomously
generates executable code, validates computations, and produces transparent
documentation. Beyond achieving high predictive accuracy, ARIA can rapidly
identify optimal feature sets and select suitable models, minimizing redundant
tuning and repetitive experimentation. In the Boston Housing case, ARIA
discovered 25 key features and determined XGBoost as the best performing model
(R square = 0.93) with minimal overfitting. Evaluations across heterogeneous
domains demonstrate ARIA's strong performance, interpretability, and efficiency
compared with state-of-the-art systems. By combining AI for research and AI for
science principles within a spec-driven architecture, ARIA establishes a new
paradigm for transparent, collaborative, and reproducible scientific discovery.

TL;DR: 提出了$How^{2}$框架，使AI代理能够提问如何完成任务的问题，存储答案并用于终身学习，在Minecraft环境中验证了抽象回答对规划效率的提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI代理在面对规划问题时如何有效提问和利用开放式"如何做X"问题来减少不确定性、填补知识空白，以支持高效规划。

Method: 引入$How^{2}$记忆代理框架，在Plancraft（Minecraft制作环境）中评估，使用不同抽象层次的教师模型回答问题，从可执行动作序列到高级子目标描述。

Result: 终身学习代理从抽象化且与当前状态解耦的回答中获益最大，这种回答方式能更好地支持规划能力的持续改进。

Conclusion: $How^{2}$为基于LLM的代理提供了一种通过在交互环境中提问来随时间提升规划能力的方法。

Abstract: An agent facing a planning problem can use answers to how-to questions to
reduce uncertainty and fill knowledge gaps, helping it solve both current and
future tasks. However, their open ended nature, where valid answers to "How do
I X?" range from executable actions to high-level descriptions of X's
sub-goals, makes them challenging for AI agents to ask, and for AI experts to
answer, in ways that support efficient planning. We introduce $How^{2}$, a
memory agent framework that enables agents to ask how-to questions, store the
answers, and reuse them for lifelong learning in interactive environments. We
evaluate our approach in Plancraft, a Minecraft crafting environment, where
agents must complete an assembly task by manipulating inventory items. Using
teacher models that answer at varying levels of abstraction, from executable
action sequences to high-level subgoal descriptions, we show that lifelong
learning agents benefit most from answers that are abstracted and decoupled
from the current state. $How^{2}$ offers a way for LLM-based agents to improve
their planning capabilities over time by asking questions in interactive
environments.

*Peiming Li,Zhiyuan Hu,Yang Tang,Shiyu Li,Xi Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Critique-Driven Reasoning Alignment (CDRA)方法，将LLM对齐重新定义为结构化推理过程，通过DeepPref基准和Pers-GenPRM模型解决用户深层偏好推断和防御性推理的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM个性化对齐方法存在双重挑战：无法推断用户的深层隐含偏好（包括未陈述的目标、语义背景和风险容忍度），以及缺乏应对现实世界模糊性的防御性推理能力。

Method: 1. 引入DeepPref基准数据集（3000个偏好查询对，涵盖20个主题）；2. 提出个性化生成过程奖励模型(Pers-GenPRM)，将奖励建模重构为个性化推理任务；3. 使用Critique-Driven Policy Alignment进行策略对齐。

Result: 实验证明CDRA在发现和适应用户真实偏好方面表现优异，同时执行稳健的推理。

Conclusion: CDRA通过结构化推理过程有效解决了LLM个性化对齐中的认知差距问题，实现了更好的用户偏好适应和防御性推理能力。

Abstract: Personalized alignment is crucial for enabling Large Language Models (LLMs)
to engage effectively in user-centric interactions. However, current methods
face a dual challenge: they fail to infer users' deep implicit preferences
(including unstated goals, semantic context and risk tolerances), and they lack
the defensive reasoning required to navigate real-world ambiguity. This
cognitive gap leads to responses that are superficial, brittle and
short-sighted. To address this, we propose Critique-Driven Reasoning Alignment
(CDRA), which reframes alignment from a scalar reward-matching task into a
structured reasoning process. First, to bridge the preference inference gap, we
introduce the DeepPref benchmark. This dataset, comprising 3000
preference-query pairs across 20 topics, is curated by simulating a
multi-faceted cognitive council that produces critique-annotated reasoning
chains to deconstruct query semantics and reveal latent risks. Second, to
instill defensive reasoning, we introduce the Personalized Generative Process
Reward Model (Pers-GenPRM), which frames reward modeling as a personalized
reasoning task. It generates a critique chain to evaluate a response's
alignment with user preferences before outputting a final score based on this
rationale. Ultimately, this interpretable, structured reward signal guides
policy model through Critique-Driven Policy Alignment, a process-level online
reinforcement learning algorithm integrating both numerical and natural
language feedback. Experiments demonstrate that CDRA excels at discovering and
aligning with users' true preferences while executing robust reasoning. Our
code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Zephyrian-Hugh/Deep-pref.

TL;DR: 分析了7种代表性AI对齐技术和7种故障模式的重叠程度，探讨了防御深度策略的有效性及其对AI安全研究和风险优先级的启示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI对齐技术都存在故障模式，防御深度策略依赖于不同技术故障模式的不相关性。如果所有技术的故障模式高度相关，防御深度就无法提供额外保护。

Method: 分析7种代表性对齐技术和7种故障模式，评估它们之间的重叠程度和相关关系。

Result: 发现不同对齐技术的故障模式存在一定程度的差异，但并非完全独立，这对防御深度策略的有效性提出了挑战。

Conclusion: 需要更系统地评估对齐技术故障模式的相关性，并据此优化防御深度策略和研究优先级，以更有效地降低AI安全风险。

Abstract: AI alignment research aims to develop techniques to ensure that AI systems do
not cause harm. However, every alignment technique has failure modes, which are
conditions in which there is a non-negligible chance that the technique fails
to provide safety. As a strategy for risk mitigation, the AI safety community
has increasingly adopted a defense-in-depth framework: Conceding that there is
no single technique which guarantees safety, defense-in-depth consists in
having multiple redundant protections against safety failure, such that safety
can be maintained even if some protections fail. However, the success of
defense-in-depth depends on how (un)correlated failure modes are across
alignment techniques. For example, if all techniques had the exact same failure
modes, the defense-in-depth approach would provide no additional protection at
all. In this paper, we analyze 7 representative alignment techniques and 7
failure modes to understand the extent to which they overlap. We then discuss
our results' implications for understanding the current level of risk and how
to prioritize AI alignment research in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型驱动的智能代理在执行自然语言程序（如食谱、科学协议等）时因文本变异性大、缺乏结构而导致的执行漂移或失败问题。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：Teach阶段将程序文本结构化并丰富可执行逻辑，Execute阶段根据实时输入和环境反馈进行动态执行。通过图表示捕获任务依赖、决策点和可重用子程序。

Result: 在ALFWorld和ScienceWorld等四个不同基准测试中达到最先进性能，证明了基于图的程序表示对鲁棒和泛化执行的有效性。

Conclusion: 图表示为智能代理提供了强大的中间抽象层，能够减少长时程推理中的错误积累，实现可靠的自驱动自动化。

Abstract: Learning to autonomously execute long-horizon procedures from natural
language remains a core challenge for intelligent agents. Free-form
instructions such as recipes, scientific protocols, or business workflows
encode rich procedural knowledge, but their variability and lack of structure
cause agents driven by large language models (LLMs) to drift or fail during
execution. We introduce Procedure Aware DynaMic Execution (PADME), an agent
framework that produces and exploits a graph-based representation of
procedures. Unlike prior work that relies on manual graph construction or
unstructured reasoning, PADME autonomously transforms procedural text into
executable graphs that capture task dependencies, decision points, and reusable
subroutines. Central to PADME is a two-phase methodology; Teach phase, which
focuses on systematic structuring, enrichment with executable logic of
procedures, followed by Execute phase, which enables dynamic execution in
response to real-time inputs and environment feedback. This separation ensures
quality assurance and scalability, allowing expert knowledge to be encoded once
and reliably reused across varying contexts. The graph representation also
provides an inductive bias that reduces error accumulation in long-horizon
reasoning, underscoring the importance of structured procedure modeling for
reliable agent-driven automation. Empirically, PADME achieves state-of-the-art
performance on four diverse benchmarks, including ALFWorld and ScienceWorld.
These results demonstrate that agents equipped with graph-based procedure
representations offer a powerful intermediate abstraction for robust and
generalizable execution.

Conclusion: AAS为从"经验时代"迈向"模拟时代"提供了基础，通过生成高质量交互数据支持教育系统研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Agents are increasingly pivotal in
simulating and understanding complex human systems and interactions. We propose
the AI-Agent School (AAS) system, built around a self-evolving mechanism that
leverages agents for simulating complex educational dynamics. Addressing the
fragmented issues in teaching process modeling and the limitations of agents
performance in simulating diverse educational participants, AAS constructs the
Zero-Exp strategy, employs a continuous "experience-reflection-optimization"
cycle, grounded in a dual memory base comprising experience and knowledge bases
and incorporating short-term and long-term memory components. Through this
mechanism, agents autonomously evolve via situated interactions within diverse
simulated school scenarios. This evolution enables agents to more accurately
model the nuanced, multi-faceted teacher-student engagements and underlying
learning processes found in physical schools. Experiment confirms that AAS can
effectively simulate intricate educational dynamics and is effective in
fostering advanced agent cognitive abilities, providing a foundational stepping
stone from the "Era of Experience" to the "Era of Simulation" by generating
high-fidelity behavioral and interaction data.

Conclusion: 该框架、基准和指标为开发本体论忠实技能分解系统提供了可复现的基础。

Abstract: This paper investigates automated skill decomposition using Large Language
Models (LLMs) and proposes a rigorous, ontology-grounded evaluation framework.
Our framework standardizes the pipeline from prompting and generation to
normalization and alignment with ontology nodes. To evaluate outputs, we
introduce two metrics: a semantic F1-score that uses optimal embedding-based
matching to assess content accuracy, and a hierarchy-aware F1-score that
credits structurally correct placements to assess granularity. We conduct
experiments on ROME-ESCO-DecompSkill, a curated subset of parents, comparing
two prompting strategies: zero-shot and leakage-safe few-shot with exemplars.
Across diverse LLMs, zero-shot offers a strong baseline, while few-shot
consistently stabilizes phrasing and granularity and improves hierarchy-aware
alignment. A latency analysis further shows that exemplar-guided prompts are
competitive - and sometimes faster - than unguided zero-shot due to more
schema-compliant completions. Together, the framework, benchmark, and metrics
provide a reproducible foundation for developing ontology-faithful skill
decomposition systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了维度级奖励模型（DRM），通过置信度、相关性和连贯性三个维度评估推理过程质量，解决了传统结果监督强化学习和过程级奖励模型的局限性，提升大语言模型的多步推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的结果监督强化学习只奖励最终正确答案，容易传播错误推理且奖励信号稀疏；过程级奖励模型虽然提供更密集的反馈，但缺乏泛化性和可解释性，需要任务特定的推理过程分割。

Method: 提出维度级奖励模型（DRM），从三个基本维度评估推理过程质量：置信度（不确定性校准）、相关性（语义对齐）和连贯性（逻辑一致性）。这些维度无需真实答案即可进行可解释的评估。

Result: 实验结果显示DRM提供了有效的监督信号，指导LLMs优化并增强其推理能力。在数学、问答、代码执行和谜题等开放领域任务上，DRM监督训练在分布内和分布外都取得了持续增益。

Conclusion: 多维度的推理过程监督可以提升LLMs在训练分布之外的泛化推理能力。

Abstract: Improving the multi-step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
a critical yet challenging task. The dominant paradigm, outcome-supervised
reinforcement learning (RLVR), rewards only correct final answers, often
propagating flawed reasoning and suffering from sparse reward signals. While
process-level reward models (PRMs) provide denser, step-by-step feedback, they
lack generalizability and interpretability, requiring task-specific
segmentation of the reasoning process. To this end, we propose the
Dimension-level Reward Model (DRM), a new supervision framework that bridges
the gap between these two approaches. DRM evaluates the quality of a reasoning
process along three fundamental, complementary, and interpretable dimensions:
Confidence for uncertainty calibration, Relevance for semantic alignment, and
Coherence for logical consistency. Together, these dimensions capture aspects
beyond final answer correctness and enable interpretable assessment without
requiring ground truth answers. Experimental results show that DRM provides
effective supervision signals, guides the optimization of LLMs and enhances
their reasoning ability. In particular, DRM-supervised training achieves
consistent gains on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution open-domain
tasks, including mathematics, question answering, code execution, and puzzles.
Our findings demonstrate that multidimensional supervision of the reasoning
process can improve the generalized reasoning ability of LLMs beyond the
training distribution.

*Yisen Gao,Jiaxin Bai,Yi Huang,Xingcheng Fu,Qingyun Sun,Yangqiu Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DARK是一个统一框架，用于知识图谱中的演绎和溯因推理，通过掩码扩散模型捕获查询与结论间的双向关系，在两种推理任务上均取得最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将演绎推理（从查询检索实体）和溯因推理（从观察生成假设）孤立处理，但两者具有协同潜力：演绎可验证假设，溯因可发现深层逻辑模式。

Method: 提出DARK框架，包含两个关键创新：1）自反去噪过程，在溯因推理中迭代生成并验证候选假设；2）逻辑探索强化学习方法，同时掩码查询和结论，探索新颖推理组合。

Result: 在多个基准知识图谱上的广泛实验表明，DARK在演绎和溯因推理任务上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 统一方法在知识图谱推理中具有显著优势，DARK框架成功实现了演绎和溯因推理的协同整合。

Abstract: Deductive and abductive reasoning are two critical paradigms for analyzing
knowledge graphs, enabling applications from financial query answering to
scientific discovery. Deductive reasoning on knowledge graphs usually involves
retrieving entities that satisfy a complex logical query, while abductive
reasoning generates plausible logical hypotheses from observations. Despite
their clear synergistic potential, where deduction can validate hypotheses and
abduction can uncover deeper logical patterns, existing methods address them in
isolation. To bridge this gap, we propose DARK, a unified framework for
Deductive and Abductive Reasoning in Knowledge graphs. As a masked diffusion
model capable of capturing the bidirectional relationship between queries and
conclusions, DARK has two key innovations. First, to better leverage deduction
for hypothesis refinement during abductive reasoning, we introduce a
self-reflective denoising process that iteratively generates and validates
candidate hypotheses against the observed conclusion. Second, to discover
richer logical associations, we propose a logic-exploration reinforcement
learning approach that simultaneously masks queries and conclusions, enabling
the model to explore novel reasoning compositions. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark knowledge graphs show that DARK achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both deductive and abductive reasoning tasks, demonstrating the
significant benefits of our unified approach.

Abstract: Governance of data, compliance, and business privacy matters, particularly
for healthcare and finance businesses. Since the recent emergence of AI
enterprise AI assistants enhancing business productivity, safeguarding private
data and compliance is now a priority. With the implementation of AI assistants
across the enterprise, the zero data retention can be achieved by implementing
zero data retention policies by Large Language Model businesses like Open AI
and Anthropic and Meta. In this work, we explore zero data retention policies
for the Enterprise apps of large language models (LLMs). Our key contribution
is defining the architectural, compliance, and usability trade-offs of such
systems in parallel. In this research work, we examine the development of
commercial AI assistants with two industry leaders and market titans in this
arena - Salesforce and Microsoft. Both of these companies used distinct
technical architecture to support zero data retention policies. Salesforce
AgentForce and Microsoft Copilot are among the leading AI assistants providing
much-needed push to business productivity in customer care. The purpose of this
paper is to analyze the technical architecture and deployment of zero data
retention policy by consuming applications as well as big language models
service providers like Open Ai, Anthropic, and Meta.

### [444] [Analyzing and Internalizing Complex Policy Documents for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11588)
*Jiateng Liu,Zhenhailong Wang,Xiaojiang Huang,Yingjie Li,Xing Fan,Xiang Li,Chenlei Guo,Ruhi Sarikaya,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了CC-Gen基准和CAP-CPT方法，用于解决LLM代理系统中策略文档内部化的问题，通过可控复杂度评估和针对性预训练提升策略理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理系统中的策略文档随着需求增长而迅速扩展，导致高计算开销，需要开发将策略文档嵌入模型先验的内部化方法。

Method: 引入CC-Gen基准生成器，提供可控复杂度的评估框架；提出CAP-CPT方法，通过解析策略文档、分类关键规范，并利用自回归预训练损失实现策略内部化。

Result: CAP-CPT在所有设置中均优于SFT基线，在Qwen-3-32B上提升达41%和22%，在CC-Gen上实现97.3%的提示长度减少，并在tau-Bench上以最少SFT数据获得进一步改进。

Conclusion: CAP-CPT有效缓解了数据和推理负担，通过针对性预训练显著提升了策略内部化性能，特别是在处理复杂工作流规范时表现优异。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems rely on in-context policy
documents encoding diverse business rules. As requirements grow, these
documents expand rapidly, causing high computational overhead. This motivates
developing internalization methods that embed policy documents into model
priors while preserving performance. Prior prompt compression work targets
generic prompts, but agentic policy documents span multiple complexity levels
and require deeper reasoning, making internalization harder. We introduce
CC-Gen, an agentic benchmark generator with Controllable Complexity across four
levels, enabling systematic evaluation of agents' ability to handle complexity
and offering a unified framework for assessing policy internalization. Our
analysis shows that complex policy specifications governing workflows pose
major reasoning challenges. Supporting internalization with gold user agent
interaction trajectories containing chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations via
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is data-intensive and degrades sharply as policy
complexity increases. To mitigate data and reasoning burdens, we propose
Category-Aware Policy Continued Pretraining (CAP-CPT). Our automated pipeline
parses policy documents to extract key specifications, grouping them into
factual, behavioral, and conditional categories, and isolating complex
conditions that drive workflow complexity. This guides targeted data synthesis
and enables agents to internalize policy information through an autoregressive
pretraining loss. Experiments show CAP-CPT improves SFT baselines in all
settings, with up to 41% and 22% gains on Qwen-3-32B, achieving 97.3% prompt
length reduction on CC-Gen and further enhancing tau-Bench with minimal SFT
data.

*Israel Mason-Williams,Gabryel Mason-Williams*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI研究缺乏可重复性标准导致政策制定者面临信息噪音问题，阻碍有效AI治理。论文建议通过预注册、提高统计能力和发表阴性结果等可重复性协议来改善AI治理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI研究发表速度快但缺乏科学标准，导致政策制定者面临低信噪比的信息环境，难以制定有效的AI治理政策。

Method: 通过借鉴其他科学领域的可重复性危机经验，提出在AI研究中采用预注册、提高统计能力和发表阴性结果等可重复性协议。

Result: 分析表明AI研究正面临可重复性危机，这削弱了政策制定者制定有效治理协议的能力。

Conclusion: 虽然AI治理需要反应性，但政策制定者应将可重复性协议视为治理核心工具，并要求AI研究达到更高标准。

Abstract: AI policymakers are responsible for delivering effective governance
mechanisms that can provide safe, aligned and trustworthy AI development.
However, the information environment offered to policymakers is characterised
by an unnecessarily low Signal-To-Noise Ratio, favouring regulatory capture and
creating deep uncertainty and divides on which risks should be prioritised from
a governance perspective. We posit that the current publication speeds in AI
combined with the lack of strong scientific standards, via weak reproducibility
protocols, effectively erodes the power of policymakers to enact meaningful
policy and governance protocols. Our paper outlines how AI research could adopt
stricter reproducibility guidelines to assist governance endeavours and improve
consensus on the AI risk landscape. We evaluate the forthcoming reproducibility
crisis within AI research through the lens of crises in other scientific
domains; providing a commentary on how adopting preregistration, increased
statistical power and negative result publication reproducibility protocols can
enable effective AI governance. While we maintain that AI governance must be
reactive due to AI's significant societal implications we argue that
policymakers and governments must consider reproducibility protocols as a core
tool in the governance arsenal and demand higher standards for AI research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一个结合可解释AI、生存分析和RFM分析的三组件框架，用于客户流失分析，旨在从单纯预测转向制定个性化保留策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线零售中客户获取成本高于保留成本，但现有流失模型多为黑箱，缺乏对流失原因、干预时机和高风险客户群体的洞察。

Method: 集成可解释AI量化特征贡献、生存分析建模时间相关流失风险、RFM分析按交易行为细分客户的三组件框架。

Result: 该框架能够识别流失驱动因素、估计干预窗口、优先处理目标细分市场，从而支持减少流失和增强客户忠诚度的策略。

Conclusion: 通过整合多种分析方法，该研究为制定基于可解释证据的个性化客户保留策略提供了有效框架。

Abstract: In online retail, customer acquisition typically incurs higher costs than
customer retention, motivating firms to invest in churn analytics. However,
many contemporary churn models operate as opaque black boxes, limiting insight
into the determinants of attrition, the timing of retention opportunities, and
the identification of high-risk customer segments. Accordingly, the emphasis
should shift from prediction alone to the design of personalized retention
strategies grounded in interpretable evidence. This study advances a
three-component framework that integrates explainable AI to quantify feature
contributions, survival analysis to model time-to-event churn risk, and RFM
profiling to segment customers by transactional behaviour. In combination,
these methods enable the attribution of churn drivers, estimation of
intervention windows, and prioritization of segments for targeted actions,
thereby supporting strategies that reduce attrition and strengthen customer
loyalty.

Motivation: 现有智能体基准主要关注任务完成度，但忽视了并行和异步操作中的时间效率问题。

Method: 基于《煮过头》游戏设计简化动作空间，构建多智能体协作烹饪任务环境，评估LLMs在并行战略规划中的表现。

Result: 当前最先进的LLMs在ParaCook基准上表现不佳，生成的计划在并行动作和协调方面存在困难，但在抽象任务中显示出并行优化的潜力。

Conclusion: ParaCook为开发时间效率感知的多智能体规划提供了可扩展的评估框架，并揭示了LLMs在并行规划方面的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities for planning
long-horizon, real-world tasks, yet existing agent benchmarks focus on task
completion while neglecting time efficiency in parallel and asynchronous
operations. To address this, we present ParaCook, a benchmark for
time-efficient collaborative planning. Inspired by the Overcooked game,
ParaCook provides an environment for various challenging interaction planning
of multi-agent systems that are instantiated as cooking tasks, with a
simplified action space to isolate the core challenge of strategic parallel
planning. Through a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, we find
that current approaches achieve suboptimal plans, which struggle with parallel
actions or coordination. Our analysis also reveals LLMs' potential on abstract
tasks where they can focus on high-level parallel optimization. ParaCook
provides a scalable evaluation framework with adjustable complexity,
establishing a foundation for developing and assessing time efficiency-aware
multi-agent planning. The code and data are available at

Conclusion: SR-Scientist成功将LLM提升为自主AI科学家，显著提升了科学方程发现的性能，并展示了良好的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied to scientific
equation discovery, leveraging their embedded scientific knowledge for
hypothesis generation. However, current methods typically confine LLMs to the
role of an equation proposer within search algorithms like genetic programming.
In this paper, we present SR-Scientist, a framework that elevates the LLM from
a simple equation proposer to an autonomous AI scientist that writes code to
analyze data, implements the equation as code, submits it for evaluation, and
optimizes the equation based on experimental feedback. Specifically, we wrap
the code interpreter into a set of tools for data analysis and equation
evaluation. The agent is instructed to optimize the equation by utilizing these
tools over a long horizon with minimal human-defined pipelines. Empirical
results show that SR-Scientist outperforms baseline methods by an absolute
margin of 6% to 35% on datasets covering four science disciplines.
Additionally, we demonstrate our method's robustness to noise, the
generalization of the discovered equations to out-of-domain data, and their
symbolic accuracy. Furthermore, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning
framework to enhance the agent's capabilities.

Abstract: Mental health applications have emerged as a critical area in computational
health, driven by rising global rates of mental illness, the integration of AI
in psychological care, and the need for scalable solutions in underserved
communities. These include therapy chatbots, crisis detection, and wellness
platforms handling sensitive data, requiring specialized AI safety beyond
general safeguards due to emotional vulnerability, risks like misdiagnosis or
symptom exacerbation, and precise management of vulnerable states to avoid
severe outcomes such as self-harm or loss of trust. Despite AI safety advances,
general safeguards inadequately address mental health-specific challenges,
including crisis intervention accuracy to avert escalations, therapeutic
guideline adherence to prevent misinformation, scale limitations in
resource-constrained settings, and adaptation to nuanced dialogues where
generics may introduce biases or miss distress signals. We introduce an
approach to apply Constitutional AI training with domain-specific mental health
principles for safe, domain-adapted CAI systems in computational mental health
applications.

Motivation: 多任务学习在推荐系统中能捕捉用户多样化兴趣，但面临负迁移和跷跷板现象的挑战，需要解决任务间的复杂且矛盾的相关性问题。

Method: 提出个性化直接路由梯度框架(DRGrad)，包含路由器、更新器和个性化门网络三个组件，在训练过程中判断任务间的利害关系，利用有效梯度减少冲突。

Result: 在150亿样本的真实推荐数据集上，DRGrad在AUC指标上优于现有最先进的多任务学习模型，能有效管理任务冲突而不增加模型复杂度，同时在公共数据集上也验证了其处理不同相关性和个性化程度任务的能力。

Conclusion: DRGrad框架成功解决了多任务学习中的任务冲突问题，通过个性化路由机制有效管理梯度，在保持模型简洁的同时提升了推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has emerged as a successful strategy in
industrial-scale recommender systems, offering significant advantages such as
capturing diverse users' interests and accurately detecting different behaviors
like ``click" or ``dwell time". However, negative transfer and the seesaw
phenomenon pose challenges to MTL models due to the complex and often
contradictory task correlations in real-world recommendations. To address the
problem while making better use of personalized information, we propose a
personalized Direct Routing Gradient framework (DRGrad), which consists of
three key components: router, updater and personalized gate network. DRGrad
judges the stakes between tasks in the training process, which can leverage all
valid gradients for the respective task to reduce conflicts. We evaluate the
efficiency of DRGrad on complex MTL using a real-world recommendation dataset
with 15 billion samples. The results show that DRGrad's superior performance
over competing state-of-the-art MTL models, especially in terms of AUC (Area
Under the Curve) metrics, indicating that it effectively manages task conflicts
in multi-task learning environments without increasing model complexity, while
also addressing the deficiencies in noise processing. Moreover, experiments on
the public Census-income dataset and Synthetic dataset, have demonstrated the
capability of DRGrad in judging and routing the stakes between tasks with
varying degrees of correlation and personalization.

Abstract: Rapid urbanization has intensified traffic congestion, environmental strain,
and inefficiencies in transportation systems, creating an urgent need for
intelligent and adaptive traffic management solutions. Conventional systems
relying on static signals and manual monitoring are inadequate for the dynamic
nature of modern traffic. This research aims to develop a unified framework
that integrates CCTV surveillance videos with multi-source data descriptors to
enhance real-time urban traffic prediction. The proposed methodology
incorporates spatio-temporal feature fusion, Frequent Episode Mining for
sequential traffic pattern discovery, and a hybrid LSTM-Transformer model for
robust traffic state forecasting. The framework was evaluated on the CityFlowV2
dataset comprising 313,931 annotated bounding boxes across 46 cameras. It
achieved a high prediction accuracy of 98.46 percent, with a macro precision of
0.9800, macro recall of 0.9839, and macro F1-score of 0.9819. FEM analysis
revealed significant sequential patterns such as moderate-congested transitions
with confidence levels exceeding 55 percent. The 46 sustained congestion alerts
are system-generated, which shows practical value for proactive congestion
management. This emphasizes the need for the incorporation of video stream
analytics with data from multiple sources for the design of real-time,
responsive, adaptable multi-level intelligent transportation systems, which
makes urban mobility smarter and safer.

Abstract: Accurate simulation of wave propagation in complex acoustic materials is
crucial for applications in sound design, noise control, and material
engineering. Traditional numerical solvers, such as finite element methods, are
computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large-scale or
real-time scenarios. In this work, we introduce a dataset of 31,000 acoustic
materials, named HA30K, designed and simulated solving the Helmholtz equations.
For each material, we provide the geometric configuration and the corresponding
pressure field solution, enabling data-driven approaches to learn Helmholtz
equation solutions. As a baseline, we explore a deep learning approach based on
Stable Diffusion with ControlNet, a state-of-the-art model for image
generation. Unlike classical solvers, our approach leverages GPU
parallelization to process multiple simulations simultaneously, drastically
reducing computation time. By representing solutions as images, we bypass the
need for complex simulation software and explicit equation-solving.
Additionally, the number of diffusion steps can be adjusted at inference time,
balancing speed and quality. We aim to demonstrate that deep learning-based
methods are particularly useful in early-stage research, where rapid
exploration is more critical than absolute accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了GradFix方法，通过近似新模型的梯度符号结构来跨预训练模型传输任务向量，仅需少量标注样本即可实现知识迁移，无需额外微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当发布新的基础模型时，即使任务已在先前版本中解决，实践者通常需要重复完整微调。任务向量虽然能捕获模型对特定任务的适应，但由于参数空间不对齐，往往无法在不同预训练模型间传输。

Method: GradFix方法通过计算目标模型的少量梯度来近似理想的梯度符号结构，并据此对源任务向量进行掩码处理，生成与目标损失地形局部对齐的更新，将任务向量重新基于新的预训练。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中表现出显著性能提升，始终优于朴素的任务向量相加和少样本微调方法。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了理论保证确保一阶下降，通过梯度符号结构实现了跨预训练模型的有效知识传输。

Abstract: When a new release of a foundation model is published, practitioners
typically need to repeat full fine-tuning, even if the same task has already
been solved in the previous version. A promising alternative is to reuse the
parameter changes (i.e., task vectors) that capture how a model adapts to a
specific task. However, they often fail to transfer across different
pre-trained models due to their misaligned parameter space. In this work, we
show that the key to successful transfer lies in the sign structure of the
gradients of the new model. Based on this insight, we propose GradFix, a novel
method that approximates the ideal gradient sign structure and leverages it to
transfer knowledge using only a handful of labeled samples. Notably, this
requires no additional fine-tuning: the adaptation is achieved by computing a
few gradients at the target model and masking the source task vector
accordingly. This yields an update that is locally aligned with the target loss
landscape, effectively rebasing the task vector onto the new pre-training. We
provide a theoretical guarantee that our method ensures first-order descent.
Empirically, we demonstrate significant performance gains on vision and
language benchmarks, consistently outperforming naive task vector addition and
few-shot fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于NOvA中微子实验的点集神经网络，通过混合两个稀疏2D视图的信息，在内存使用减少90%的同时实现了96.8%的AUC分数，优于独立处理两个视图的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NOvA实验需要将探测器中的原始命中点匹配到源粒子并识别粒子类型。传统方法使用聚类和CNN，但由于探测器结构，数据以两个稀疏2D图像（XZ和YZ视图）呈现，而非3D表示。

Method: 提出点集神经网络，直接在稀疏矩阵上操作，通过混合两个视图信息的操作来处理数据。

Result: 模型内存使用量比先前方法减少90%以上，同时达到96.8%的AUC分数，明显高于两个视图独立处理的85.4%。

Conclusion: 点集神经网络能有效处理NOvA实验的稀疏2D数据，在显著减少内存需求的同时提高了粒子识别性能。

Abstract: NOvA is a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment that detects neutrino
particles from the NuMI beam at Fermilab. Before data from this experiment can
be used in analyses, raw hits in the detector must be matched to their source
particles, and the type of each particle must be identified. This task has
commonly been done using a mix of traditional clustering approaches and
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Due to the construction of the detector,
the data is presented as two sparse 2D images: an XZ and a YZ view of the
detector, rather than a 3D representation. We propose a point set neural
network that operates on the sparse matrices with an operation that mixes
information from both views. Our model uses less than 10% of the memory
required using previous methods while achieving a 96.8% AUC score, a higher
score than obtained when both views are processed independently (85.4%).

*Luca Scimeca,Thomas Jiralerspong,Berton Earnshaw,Jason Hartford,Yoshua Bengio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了谱各向异性高斯扩散(SAGD)，通过引入各向异性噪声算子来构建扩散模型的归纳偏置，用结构化的频率对角协方差替代各向同性前向协方差，从而更好地适应数据分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散概率模型(DPMs)虽然取得了强大的生成性能，但其归纳偏置仍然很大程度上是隐含的。本文旨在将归纳偏置显式地构建到扩散模型的训练和采样过程中，以更好地适应目标数据分布。

Method: 引入各向异性噪声算子，用结构化的频率对角协方差替换各向同性前向协方差，统一了带通掩码和幂律加权，允许强调或抑制指定频段，同时保持前向过程为高斯分布。推导了各向异性协方差的得分关系。

Result: 实验表明，诱导的各向异性在多个视觉数据集上优于标准扩散模型，并能够实现选择性忽略：在学习过程中忽略特定频段中已知的损坏。

Conclusion: 精心设计的各向异性前向噪声为在DPMs中定制归纳偏置提供了一个简单而有原则的调节手段。

Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have achieved strong generative
performance, yet their inductive biases remain largely implicit. In this work,
we aim to build inductive biases into the training and sampling of diffusion
models to better accommodate the target distribution of the data to model. We
introduce an anisotropic noise operator that shapes these biases by replacing
the isotropic forward covariance with a structured, frequency-diagonal
covariance. This operator unifies band-pass masks and power-law weightings,
allowing us to emphasize or suppress designated frequency bands, while keeping
the forward process Gaussian. We refer to this as spectrally anisotropic
Gaussian diffusion (SAGD). In this work, we derive the score relation for
anisotropic covariances and show that, under full support, the learned score
converges to the true data score as $t\!\to\!0$, while anisotropy reshapes the
probability-flow path from noise to data. Empirically, we show the induced
anisotropy outperforms standard diffusion across several vision datasets, and
enables selective omission: learning while ignoring known corruptions confined
to specific bands. Together, these results demonstrate that carefully designed
anisotropic forward noise provides a simple, yet principled, handle to tailor
inductive bias in DPMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了两种基于Bode图表示的新损失函数log-B和log-BW，用于电化学阻抗谱数据的等效电路模型拟合。通过大规模数据集评估，发现X2损失函数在拟合质量上表现最佳，而log-B在计算效率和参数误差方面具有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统电化学阻抗谱数据使用等效电路模型进行拟合时，通常采用非线性最小二乘法最小化损失函数。现有损失函数在收敛性、计算效率和拟合质量方面存在局限性，需要开发新的损失函数来优化这些性能指标。

Method: 基于EIS的Bode图表示推导出两种新损失函数log-B和log-BW。使用生成的大规模EIS数据集，评估新损失函数与现有损失函数在R2分数、卡方值、计算效率和平均绝对百分比误差等方面的性能。

Result: 统计比较显示，损失函数的选择影响收敛性、计算效率、拟合质量和MAPE。X2损失函数在多个拟合质量指标上表现最佳，而log-B损失函数计算速度快约1.4倍，且对大多数电路组件产生更低的MAPE。

Conclusion: 当拟合质量是主要目标时，X2损失函数是首选；对于大规模最小二乘拟合应用，如训练机器学习模型，log-B损失函数因其计算效率和较低的参数误差而成为强有力的替代选择。

Abstract: Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data is typically modeled using
an equivalent circuit model (ECM), with parameters obtained by minimizing a
loss function via nonlinear least squares fitting. This paper introduces two
new loss functions, log-B and log-BW, derived from the Bode representation of
EIS. Using a large dataset of generated EIS data, the performance of proposed
loss functions was evaluated alongside existing ones in terms of R2 scores,
chi-squared, computational efficiency, and the mean absolute percentage error
(MAPE) between the predicted component values and the original values.
Statistical comparisons revealed that the choice of loss function impacts
convergence, computational efficiency, quality of fit, and MAPE. Our analysis
showed that X2 loss function (squared sum of residuals with proportional
weighting) achieved the highest performance across multiple quality of fit
metrics, making it the preferred choice when the quality of fit is the primary
goal. On the other hand, log-B offered a slightly lower quality of fit while
being approximately 1.4 times faster and producing lower MAPE for most circuit
components, making log-B as a strong alternative. This is a critical factor for
large-scale least squares fitting in data-driven applications, such as training
machine learning models on extensive datasets or iterations.

*Changchang Sun,Vickie Chen,Yan Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SODA方法，通过语义凝聚知识蒸馏解决跨模态哈希中多标签语义提取与原始多模态数据交互不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度跨模态哈希方法虽然通过自监督学习语义信息取得进展，但多标签语义提取过程未能与原始多模态数据显式交互，导致学习到的表示级语义信息与异构多模态数据不兼容，阻碍了模态间隙的桥接。

Method: 将多标签信息作为新的文本模态，重新表述为一组真实标签提示，描述图像中呈现的语义。设计跨模态教师网络，在图像和标签模态之间有效蒸馏跨模态语义特征，为图像模态学习良好映射的汉明空间。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，我们的模型优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: SODA方法通过语义凝聚知识蒸馏方案，能够全面保留图像和文本模态之间的语义相似性，显著提升跨模态哈希性能。

Abstract: Recently, deep supervised cross-modal hashing methods have achieve compelling
success by learning semantic information in a self-supervised way. However,
they still suffer from the key limitation that the multi-label semantic
extraction process fail to explicitly interact with raw multimodal data, making
the learned representation-level semantic information not compatible with the
heterogeneous multimodal data and hindering the performance of bridging
modality gap. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel
semantic cohesive knowledge distillation scheme for deep cross-modal hashing,
dubbed as SODA. Specifically, the multi-label information is introduced as a
new textual modality and reformulated as a set of ground-truth label prompt,
depicting the semantics presented in the image like the text modality. Then, a
cross-modal teacher network is devised to effectively distill cross-modal
semantic characteristics between image and label modalities and thus learn a
well-mapped Hamming space for image modality. In a sense, such Hamming space
can be regarded as a kind of prior knowledge to guide the learning of
cross-modal student network and comprehensively preserve the semantic
similarities between image and text modality. Extensive experiments on two
benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over the
state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: LMCache是一个高效的KV缓存解决方案，通过跨引擎和查询共享KV缓存来提升LLM推理系统的资源效率，支持缓存卸载和预填充-解码分离，在vLLM上实现了高达15倍的吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM推理系统将引擎和查询独立处理导致资源效率低下，现有方案无法有效实现KV缓存的跨引擎通信和共享。

Method: LMCache提取并存储现代LLM引擎生成的KV缓存，通过优化的数据移动、计算和I/O流水线、模块化连接器和控制API实现高效缓存管理。

Result: 与vLLM结合使用时，LMCache在不同工作负载下实现了高达15倍的吞吐量提升，并在企业推理系统中得到广泛应用。

Conclusion: LMCache通过高效的KV缓存共享机制显著提升了LLM推理系统的资源利用率，为未来KV缓存解决方案提供了宝贵经验。

Abstract: Today's LLM inference systems treat individual engines and queries
independently for simplicity, but this causes significant resource
inefficiencies. While there are proposals to avoid redundant computation by
reusing KV caches across queries and to increase GPU utilization by
disaggregating a single query to different engines, their promises cannot be
realized without efficiently offloading and communicating KV cache across LLM
inference engines and queries.
  We present LMCache, the first and so far the most efficient open-source KV
caching solution, which extracts and stores KV caches generated by modern LLM
engines (vLLM and SGLang) and shares the KV caches across engines and queries.
LMCache exposes KV caches in the LLM engine interface, effectively transforming
LLM engines from individual token processors to a collection of engines with KV
cache as the storage and communication medium. In particular, it supports both
cache offloading (prefix reuse across queries) and prefill-decode
disaggregation (cross-engine cache transfer). LMCache's high performance and
wide adoption stem from the following contributions: highly optimized KV cache
data movement with performance optimizations including batched data movement
operations, compute and I/O pipelining; a modular KV cache connector component,
decoupling LMCache from the rapid evolution of inference engines; a first-class
control API, such as pinning, lookup, cleanup, movement, and compression, for
flexible cache orchestration across GPU, CPU, storage, and network layers.
Evaluation shows that combining LMCache with vLLM achieves up to 15x
improvement in throughput across diverse workloads. With a growing community,
LMCache has seen dramatic growth in adoption by enterprise inference systems,
which provides valuable lessons for future KV caching solutions. The source
code of LMCache is at: https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache.

Abstract: Climate change is intensifying wildfire risks globally, making reliable
forecasting critical for adaptation strategies. While machine learning shows
promise for wildfire prediction from Earth observation data, current approaches
lack uncertainty quantification essential for risk-aware decision making. We
present the first systematic analysis of spatial uncertainty in wildfire spread
forecasting using multimodal Earth observation inputs. We demonstrate that
predictive uncertainty exhibits coherent spatial structure concentrated near
fire perimeters. Our novel distance metric reveals high-uncertainty regions
form consistent 20-60 meter buffer zones around predicted firelines - directly
applicable for emergency planning. Feature attribution identifies vegetation
health and fire activity as primary uncertainty drivers. This work enables more
robust wildfire management systems supporting communities adapting to
increasing fire risk under climate change.

Motivation: 药物相互作用是导致可预防不良事件的主要原因，同时了解哪些药物不相互作用对于安全处方和改善患者预后同样重要。

Method: 结合Mol2Vec和SMILES-BERT两种分子嵌入，引入无泄漏的基于规则的临床评分，使用三阶段元启发式策略（RSmpl-ACO-PSO）优化轻量级神经网络分类器。

Conclusion: 该研究为构建可靠、可解释且计算高效的模型提供了实用途径，能够支持更安全的药物治疗和临床决策。

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a leading cause of preventable adverse
events, often complicating treatment and increasing healthcare costs. At the
same time, knowing which drugs do not interact is equally important, as such
knowledge supports safer prescriptions and better patient outcomes. In this
study, we propose an interpretable and efficient framework that blends modern
machine learning with domain knowledge to improve DDI prediction. Our approach
combines two complementary molecular embeddings - Mol2Vec, which captures
fragment-level structural patterns, and SMILES-BERT, which learns contextual
chemical features - together with a leakage-free, rule-based clinical score
(RBScore) that injects pharmacological knowledge without relying on interaction
labels. A lightweight neural classifier is then optimized using a novel
three-stage metaheuristic strategy (RSmpl-ACO-PSO), which balances global
exploration and local refinement for stable performance. Experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate that the model achieves high predictive
accuracy (ROC-AUC 0.911, PR-AUC 0.867 on DrugBank) and generalizes well to a
clinically relevant Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus cohort. Beyond raw performance,
studies show how embedding fusion, RBScore, and the optimizer each contribute
to precision and robustness. Together, these results highlight a practical
pathway for building reliable, interpretable, and computationally efficient
models that can support safer drug therapies and clinical decision-making.

Motivation: 现有方法无法生成具有明确坐标的合成人口数据，而经纬度数据具有大范围空区和高度不均匀密度的特点，需要专门的方法处理。

Method: 使用归一化流将空间坐标映射到更规则的潜在空间，然后与其它特征结合在变分自编码器中生成合成人口，同时学习空间与非空间特征的联合分布。

Result: 在121个不同地理区域的数据集上验证，NF+VAE架构在空间准确性和实用价值方面优于流行的基准方法，包括基于copula的方法和地理区域内均匀分配方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成精细空间分辨率的合成地理人口数据，为需要详细地理信息的应用（如洪水响应、流行病传播、疏散规划和交通建模）打开了大门。

Abstract: It is increasingly important to generate synthetic populations with explicit
coordinates rather than coarse geographic areas, yet no established methods
exist to achieve this. One reason is that latitude and longitude differ from
other continuous variables, exhibiting large empty spaces and highly uneven
densities. To address this, we propose a population synthesis algorithm that
first maps spatial coordinates into a more regular latent space using
Normalizing Flows (NF), and then combines them with other features in a
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate synthetic populations. This approach
also learns the joint distribution between spatial and non-spatial features,
exploiting spatial autocorrelations. We demonstrate the method by generating
synthetic homes with the same statistical properties of real homes in 121
datasets, corresponding to diverse geographies. We further propose an
evaluation framework that measures both spatial accuracy and practical utility,
while ensuring privacy preservation. Our results show that the NF+VAE
architecture outperforms popular benchmarks, including copula-based methods and
uniform allocation within geographic areas. The ability to generate geolocated
synthetic populations at fine spatial resolution opens the door to applications
requiring detailed geography, from household responses to floods, to epidemic
spread, evacuation planning, and transport modeling.

Conclusion: 研究强调了在开发反应材料的AI加速模拟工具时，领域特定考虑因素的重要性。

Abstract: Modeling shock-to-detonation phenomena in energetic materials (EMs) requires
capturing complex physical processes such as strong shocks, rapid changes in
microstructural morphology, and nonlinear dynamics of chemical reaction fronts.
These processes participate in energy localization at hotspots, which initiate
chemical energy release leading to detonation. This study addresses the
formation of hotspots in crystalline EMs subjected to weak-to-moderate shock
loading, which, despite its critical relevance to the safe storage and handling
of EMs, remains underexplored compared to the well-studied strong shock
conditions. To overcome the computational challenges associated with direct
numerical simulations, we advance the Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional
Neural Network (PARCv2), which has been shown to be capable of predicting
strong shock responses in EMs. We improved the architecture of PARCv2 to
rapidly predict shear localizations and plastic heating, which play important
roles in the weak-to-moderate shock regime. PARCv2 is benchmarked against two
widely used physics-informed models, namely, Fourier neural operator and neural
ordinary differential equation; we demonstrate its superior performance in
capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics of shear band formation. While all models
exhibit certain failure modes, our findings underscore the importance of
domain-specific considerations in developing robust AI-accelerated simulation
tools for reactive materials.

Conclusion: C-DPS框架通过耦合扩散过程提供了一种更准确稳定的逆问题解决方案，无需约束调整或似然近似。

Abstract: Inverse problems, where the goal is to recover an unknown signal from noisy
or incomplete measurements, are central to applications in medical imaging,
remote sensing, and computational biology. Diffusion models have recently
emerged as powerful priors for solving such problems. However, existing methods
either rely on projection-based techniques that enforce measurement consistency
through heuristic updates, or they approximate the likelihood $p(\boldsymbol{y}
\mid \boldsymbol{x})$, often resulting in artifacts and instability under
complex or high-noise conditions. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel framework called \emph{coupled data and measurement space diffusion
posterior sampling} (C-DPS), which eliminates the need for constraint tuning or
likelihood approximation. C-DPS introduces a forward stochastic process in the
measurement space $\{\boldsymbol{y}_t\}$, evolving in parallel with the
data-space diffusion $\{\boldsymbol{x}_t\}$, which enables the derivation of a
closed-form posterior $p(\boldsymbol{x}_{t-1} \mid \boldsymbol{x}_t,
\boldsymbol{y}_{t-1})$. This coupling allows for accurate and recursive
sampling based on a well-defined posterior distribution. Empirical results
demonstrate that C-DPS consistently outperforms existing baselines, both
qualitatively and quantitatively, across multiple inverse problem benchmarks.

Conclusion: LLM驱动的AI工具可以有效地改进因果估计，利用生成模型的历史知识和推理能力来克服高维因果推断问题。

Abstract: We propose a simple yet effective use of LLM-powered AI tools to improve
causal estimation. In double machine learning, the accuracy of causal estimates
of the effect of a treatment on an outcome in the presence of a
high-dimensional confounder depends on the performance of estimators of
conditional expectation functions. We show that predictions made by generative
models trained on historical data can be used to improve the performance of
these estimators relative to approaches that solely rely on adjusting for
embeddings extracted from these models. We argue that the historical knowledge
and reasoning capacities associated with these generative models can help
overcome curse-of-dimensionality problems in causal inference problems. We
consider a case study using a small dataset of online jewelry auctions, and
demonstrate that inclusion of LLM-generated guesses as predictors can improve
efficiency in estimation.

Abstract: Deep learning has become a pivotal technology in fields such as computer

stochastic dynamical network models informed by stochastic differential

illustrate their characteristics and performance. Finally, we explore promising
research directions in integrating differential equations with deep learning to
offer new insights for developing intelligent computational methods that boast
enhanced interpretability and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: This study delves into the plasticity of neural networks, offering empirical
support for the notion that critical learning periods and warm-starting
performance loss can be avoided through simple adjustments to learning
hyperparameters. The critical learning phenomenon emerges when training is
initiated with deficit data. Subsequently, after numerous deficit epochs, the
network's plasticity wanes, impeding its capacity to achieve parity in accuracy
with models trained from scratch, even when extensive clean data training
follows deficit epochs. Building upon seminal research introducing critical
learning periods, we replicate key findings and broaden the experimental scope
of the main experiment from the original work. In addition, we consider a
warm-starting approach and show that it can be seen as a form of deficit
pretraining. In particular, we demonstrate that these problems can be averted
by employing a cyclic learning rate schedule. Our findings not only impact
neural network training practices but also establish a vital link between
critical learning periods and ongoing research on warm-starting neural network
training.

Conclusion: 自适应隐私预算和自适应裁剪是有效的解决方案，能在联邦学习中平衡隐私保护和模型性能。

Abstract: Federated learning is distributed model training across several clients
without disclosing raw data. Despite advancements in data privacy, risks still
remain. Differential Privacy (DP) is a technique to protect sensitive data by
adding noise to model updates, usually controlled by a fixed privacy budget.
However, this approach can introduce excessive noise, particularly when the
model converges, which compromises performance. To address this problem,
adaptive privacy budgets have been investigated as a potential solution. This
work implements DP methods using Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms with an
adaptive privacy budget, extending the SelecEval simulator. We introduce an
adaptive clipping approach in the Gaussian mechanism, ensuring that gradients
of the model are dynamically updated rather than using a fixed sensitivity. We
conduct extensive experiments with various privacy budgets, IID and non-IID
datasets, and different numbers of selected clients per round. While our
experiments were limited to 200 training rounds, the results suggest that
adaptive privacy budgets and adaptive clipping can help maintain model accuracy
while preserving privacy.

($10^{-6}$-$10^{-9}$) when paired with forced boundary conditions (FBCs),
forced nodes (FNs), and orthogonality regularization (OG). Across tasks, PINNs
are the most reliable for accuracy and recovery of excited spectra; DRM offers
the best accuracy-runtime trade-off on stationary problems; WAN is more
sensitive but competitive when weak-form constraints and FN/OG are used
effectively. Sensitivity analyses show that FBC removes boundary-loss tuning,
network width matters more than depth for single-network solvers, and most
gains occur within 5000-10,000 epochs. The same toolkit solves the KH case,
indicating transfer beyond canonical benchmarks.
  We provide practical guidelines for method selection and outline the
following extensions: time-dependent formulations for DRM and WAN, adaptive
residual-driven sampling, parallel multi-state training, and neural domain
decomposition. These results support physics-guided neural solvers as credible,
scalable tools for solving complex PDEs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Kelp是一个新型的流式风险检测插件框架，利用大模型的中间隐藏状态进行实时风险检测，相比后处理检测方法具有更高的准确性和更低的延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大模型防护措施主要是后处理检测，可能在捕获不安全内容之前就暴露了有害内容，且延迟限制迫使使用轻量级模型，限制了检测准确性。

Method: 提出Kelp框架，通过流式潜在动态头(SLD)建模风险在生成序列中的时间演化，引入锚定时间一致性(ATC)损失来强制单调的危害预测，并构建StreamGuardBench基准进行严格评估。

Result: 在各种模型和数据集上，Kelp始终优于最先进的后处理防护措施和先前的插件探针(平均F1提高15.61%)，仅使用20M参数且每token延迟增加不到0.5ms。

Conclusion: Kelp提供了一种高效、准确的流式风险检测解决方案，能够在大模型生成过程中实时识别和阻止有害内容的产生。

Abstract: Large models (LMs) are powerful content generators, yet their open-ended
nature can also introduce potential risks, such as generating harmful or biased
content. Existing guardrails mostly perform post-hoc detection that may expose
unsafe content before it is caught, and the latency constraints further push
them toward lightweight models, limiting detection accuracy. In this work, we
propose Kelp, a novel plug-in framework that enables streaming risk detection
within the LM generation pipeline. Kelp leverages intermediate LM hidden states
through a Streaming Latent Dynamics Head (SLD), which models the temporal
evolution of risk across the generated sequence for more accurate real-time
risk detection. To ensure reliable streaming moderation in real applications,
we introduce an Anchored Temporal Consistency (ATC) loss to enforce monotonic
harm predictions by embedding a benign-then-harmful temporal prior. Besides,
for a rigorous evaluation of streaming guardrails, we also present
StreamGuardBench-a model-grounded benchmark featuring on-the-fly responses from
each protected model, reflecting real-world streaming scenarios in both text
and vision-language tasks. Across diverse models and datasets, Kelp
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art post-hoc guardrails and prior plug-in
probes (15.61% higher average F1), while using only 20M parameters and adding
less than 0.5 ms of per-token latency.

TL;DR: VCON是一种通过并行执行原始模型和压缩模型来平滑过渡到压缩模型的方法，在微调过程中逐步减少原始模型的贡献并增加压缩模型的贡献，从而减少精度损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度神经网络规模的增大，压缩技术如剪枝、量化和低秩分解变得必要，但这些方法直接应用时会导致严重的精度下降。

Method: VCON在微调期间并行执行原始模型和压缩模型，逐步减少原始模型的贡献，同时逐步增加压缩模型的贡献，实现平滑过渡。

Result: 在计算机视觉和自然语言处理基准测试中，VCON与多种压缩策略结合使用，带来了一致的改进：典型增益超过3%，某些配置的精度提升达到20%。

Conclusion: VCON提供了一个可泛化的方法，可以应用于现有的压缩技术，在多个基准测试中显示出一致的性能提升。

Abstract: The increasing scale of deep neural networks has led to a growing need for
compression techniques such as pruning, quantization, and low-rank
decomposition. While these methods are very effective in reducing memory,
computation and energy consumption, they often introduce severe accuracy
degradation when applied directly. We introduce Vanishing Contributions (VCON),
a general approach for smoothly transitioning neural models into compressed
form. Rather than replacing the original network directly with its compressed
version, VCON executes the two in parallel during fine-tuning. The contribution
of the original (uncompressed) model is progressively reduced, while that of
the compressed model is gradually increased. This smooth transition allows the
network to adapt over time, improving stability and mitigating accuracy
degradation. We evaluate VCON across computer vision and natural language
processing benchmarks, in combination with multiple compression strategies.
Across all scenarios, VCON leads to consistent improvements: typical gains
exceed 3%, while some configuration exhibits accuracy boosts of 20%. VCON thus
provides a generalizable method that can be applied to the existing compression
techniques, with evidence of consistent gains across multiple benchmarks.

Motivation: 可再生能源渗透电网的时域仿真因需要微秒级时间步长而计算困难，这阻碍了可再生能源的稳定集成和气候变化缓解。

Method: 使用三种算子学习方法作为仿真替代模型，在简单测试系统上验证时间步长不变性概念，评估零样本超分辨率和稳定/不稳定动态机制间的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 算子学习方法为解决可再生能源集成中的关键挑战提供了有前景的解决方案，有助于气候变化缓解。

Abstract: Time domain simulation, i.e., modeling the system's evolution over time, is a
crucial tool for studying and enhancing power system stability and dynamic
performance. However, these simulations become computationally intractable for
renewable-penetrated grids, due to the small simulation time step required to
capture renewable energy resources' ultra-fast dynamic phenomena in the range
of 1-50 microseconds. This creates a critical need for solutions that are both
fast and scalable, posing a major barrier for the stable integration of
renewable energy resources and thus climate change mitigation. This paper
explores operator learning, a family of machine learning methods that learn
mappings between functions, as a surrogate model for these costly simulations.
The paper investigates, for the first time, the fundamental concept of
simulation time step-invariance, which enables models trained on coarse time
steps to generalize to fine-resolution dynamics. Three operator learning
methods are benchmarked on a simple test system that, while not incorporating
practical complexities of renewable-penetrated grids, serves as a first
proof-of-concept to demonstrate the viability of time step-invariance. Models
are evaluated on (i) zero-shot super-resolution, where training is performed on
a coarse simulation time step and inference is performed at super-resolution,
and (ii) generalization between stable and unstable dynamic regimes. This work
addresses a key challenge in the integration of renewable energy for the
mitigation of climate change by benchmarking operator learning methods to model
physical systems.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于强化学习的特征选择框架，将偏差缓解和特征选择整合到单一学习过程中，通过动态平衡预测性能和公平性来防止偏见重现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的静态特征排除策略无法有效防止偏见，因为隐藏的依赖关系会影响模型预测。需要一种能够动态平衡准确性、泛化性和公平性的方法。

Method: 使用强化学习框架，构建包含预测性能和公平性考量的多组件奖励函数，定义特征子集的动作空间，并与集成学习相结合。

Result: 该方法能够自适应地选择特征，在预测变量相关且偏见可能无意中重现的环境中提供灵活且可推广的特征选择方式。

Conclusion: 强化学习框架为特征选择提供了动态平衡预测性能和公平性的有效方法，优于传统的启发式过滤或包装方法。

Abstract: Static feature exclusion strategies often fail to prevent bias when hidden
dependencies influence the model predictions. To address this issue, we explore
a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates bias mitigation and
automated feature selection within a single learning process. Unlike
traditional heuristic-driven filter or wrapper approaches, our RL agent
adaptively selects features using a reward signal that explicitly integrates
predictive performance with fairness considerations. This dynamic formulation
allows the model to balance generalization, accuracy, and equity throughout the
training process, rather than rely exclusively on pre-processing adjustments or
post hoc correction mechanisms. In this paper, we describe the construction of
a multi-component reward function, the specification of the agents action space
over feature subsets, and the integration of this system with ensemble
learning. We aim to provide a flexible and generalizable way to select features
in environments where predictors are correlated and biases can inadvertently
re-emerge.

Motivation: 现有假新闻检测模型在标准设置下表现良好，但对真实用户或大语言模型生成的对抗性评论攻击仍然脆弱，这些攻击会微妙地改变模型决策，影响检测效果。

Method: 1. 将对抗性评论分为感知、认知和社会三类；2. 使用LLM生成多样化的类别特定攻击以增强对抗训练；3. 应用基于Dirichlet的自适应采样机制，在训练过程中动态调整不同评论类别的学习重点。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在保持强大检测准确性的同时，显著提高了对各种对抗性评论扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的群体自适应对抗训练策略有效提升了假新闻检测模型对对抗性评论攻击的防御能力，为构建更鲁棒的假新闻检测系统提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The spread of fake news online distorts public judgment and erodes trust in
social media platforms. Although recent fake news detection (FND) models
perform well in standard settings, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
comments-authored by real users or by large language models (LLMs)-that subtly
shift model decisions. In view of this, we first present a comprehensive
evaluation of comment attacks to existing fake news detectors and then
introduce a group-adaptive adversarial training strategy to improve the
robustness of FND models. To be specific, our approach comprises three steps:
(1) dividing adversarial comments into three psychologically grounded
categories: perceptual, cognitive, and societal; (2) generating diverse,
category-specific attacks via LLMs to enhance adversarial training; and (3)
applying a Dirichlet-based adaptive sampling mechanism (InfoDirichlet Adjusting
Mechanism) that dynamically adjusts the learning focus across different comment
categories during training. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our
method maintains strong detection accuracy while substantially increasing
robustness to a wide range of adversarial comment perturbations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏统计保证，或者依赖于容易违反的强假设，需要一种能严格控制错误发现率的训练数据识别方法

Method: 使用已知未见数据计算每个数据点的p值，构建测试集数据使用比例的保守估计量来缩放p值，然后通过数据依赖的阈值选择训练数据集

Result: 在多种模型和数据集上的实验表明，PTDI能严格控制错误发现率并实现更高的检测能力

Conclusion: PTDI方法为训练数据识别提供了严格的统计保证，显著提升了检测能力，适用于版权诉讼、隐私审计等场景

Abstract: Identifying training data within large-scale models is critical for copyright
litigation, privacy auditing, and ensuring fair evaluation. The conventional
approaches treat it as a simple binary classification task without statistical
guarantees. A recent approach is designed to control the false discovery rate
(FDR), but its guarantees rely on strong, easily violated assumptions. In this
paper, we introduce Provable Training Data Identification (PTDI), a rigorous
method that identifies a set of training data with strict false discovery rate
(FDR) control. Specifically, our method computes p-values for each data point
using a set of known unseen data, and then constructs a conservative estimator
for the data usage proportion of the test set, which allows us to scale these
p-values. Our approach then selects the final set of training data by
identifying all points whose scaled p-values fall below a data-dependent
threshold. This entire procedure enables the discovery of training data with
provable, strict FDR control and significantly boosted power. Extensive
experiments across a wide range of models (LLMs and VLMs), and datasets
demonstrate that PTDI strictly controls the FDR and achieves higher power.

Result: 开发出隐私友好的联邦k-means算法，仅需在互联设备间共享聚合信息

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了联邦环境下的k-means聚类，保护了数据隐私

Abstract: We consider the problem of federated clustering, where interconnected devices
have access to private local datasets and need to jointly cluster the overall
dataset without sharing their local dataset. Our focus is on hard clustering
based on the k-means principle. We formulate federated k-means clustering as an
instance of GTVMin. This formulation naturally lends to a federated k-means
algorithm where each device updates local cluster centroids by solving a
modified local k-means problem. The modification involves adding a penalty term
to measure the discrepancy between the cluster centroid of neighbouring
devices. Our federated k-means algorithm is privacy-friendly as it only
requires sharing aggregated information among interconnected devices.

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 查询嵌入和投影到向量空间，训练投影器和基于LLM的路由器重构原始查询；2) 在查询集上分析候选模型性能，路由器基于查询和模型性能的上下文向量学习预测模型能否正确回答新查询。

Result: 在分布内和分布外任务中都实现了最先进的路由性能，新模型可以无缝集成而无需重新训练路由器。

Conclusion: 该方法通过上下文向量有效表示模型能力，显著提高了模型路由的性能和可扩展性，为动态模型选择提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit complementary strengths. Model
routing harnesses these strengths by dynamically directing each query to the
most suitable model, given a candidate model pool. However, routing performance
relies on accurate model representations, and adding new models typically
requires retraining, limiting scalability. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel routing method using in-context vectors to represent model
capabilities. The method proceeds in two stages. First, queries are embedded
and projected into vectors, with a projector and LLM-based router trained to
reconstruct the original queries, aligning vector representations with the
router's semantic space. Second, each candidate model is profiled on a query
set, and the router learns -- based on in-context vectors of query and model
performance -- to predict whether each model can correctly answer new queries.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
routing performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks.
Moreover, our method allows for seamless integration of new models without
retraining the router. The code is available at

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Narrative Learning, a methodology where models
are defined entirely in natural language and iteratively refine their
classification criteria using explanatory prompts rather than traditional
numerical optimisation. We report on experiments to evaluate the accuracy and
potential of this approach using 3 synthetic and 3 natural datasets and compare
them against 7 baseline explainable machine learning models. We demonstrate
that on 5 out of 6 of these datasets, Narrative Learning became more accurate
than the baseline explainable models in 2025 or earlier because of improvements
in language models. We also report on trends in the lexicostatistics of these

Motivation: 大型语言模型用于生成过程模型的文本解释，但直接从大型行为抽象（如直接跟随图或Petri网）生成解释计算成本高，需要探索在输入缩减情况下的解释质量。

Method: 构建流水线：(i) 从固定日志的渐进小前缀发现多个模型，(ii) 使用LLM生成解释，(iii) 使用第二个LLM评估完整性、瓶颈识别和改进建议。

Result: 在合成日志上，适度缩减输入时解释质量基本保持，表明存在实用的成本-质量权衡。

Conclusion: 研究为资源受限环境下更高效的计算、LLM辅助的过程分析提供了可行路径，但需注意评估基于LLM评分且数据为合成的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate textual
explanations of process models discovered from event logs. Producing
explanations from large behavioral abstractions (e.g., directly-follows graphs
or Petri nets) can be computationally expensive. This paper reports an
exploratory evaluation of explanation quality under progressive
behavioral-input reduction, where models are discovered from progressively
smaller prefixes of a fixed log. Our pipeline (i) discovers models at multiple
input sizes, (ii) prompts an LLM to generate explanations, and (iii) uses a
second LLM to assess completeness, bottleneck identification, and suggested
improvements. On synthetic logs, explanation quality is largely preserved under
moderate reduction, indicating a practical cost-quality trade-off. The study is
exploratory, as the scores are LLM-based (comparative signals rather than
ground truth) and the data are synthetic. The results suggest a path toward
more computationally efficient, LLM-assisted process analysis in
resource-constrained settings.

Conclusion: 提升训练框架为深度神经网络训练提供了有效的替代方案，能够处理非光滑激活函数、改善训练条件并支持分布式优化，在逆问题应用中表现出色。

Abstract: The training of deep neural networks predominantly relies on a combination of
gradient-based optimisation and back-propagation for the computation of the
gradient. While incredibly successful, this approach faces challenges such as
vanishing or exploding gradients, difficulties with non-smooth activations, and
an inherently sequential structure that limits parallelisation. Lifted training
methods offer an alternative by reformulating the nested optimisation problem
into a higher-dimensional, constrained optimisation problem where the
constraints are no longer enforced directly but penalised with penalty terms.
This chapter introduces a unified framework that encapsulates various lifted
training strategies, including the Method of Auxiliary Coordinates, Fenchel
Lifted Networks, and Lifted Bregman Training, and demonstrates how diverse
architectures, such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons, Residual Neural Networks, and
Proximal Neural Networks fit within this structure. By leveraging tools from
convex optimisation, particularly Bregman distances, the framework facilitates
distributed optimisation, accommodates non-differentiable proximal activations,
and can improve the conditioning of the training landscape. We discuss the
implementation of these methods using block-coordinate descent strategies,
including deterministic implementations enhanced by accelerated and adaptive
optimisation techniques, as well as implicit stochastic gradient methods.
Furthermore, we explore the application of this framework to inverse problems,
detailing methodologies for both the training of specialised networks (e.g.,
unrolled architectures) and the stable inversion of pre-trained networks.
Numerical results on standard imaging tasks validate the effectiveness and
stability of the lifted Bregman approach compared to conventional training,
particularly for architectures employing proximal activations.

TL;DR: ARROW提出了一种自适应滚动多尺度时间路由方法，用于解决现有天气预测方法在时空依赖建模和长期预测方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动的天气预测方法通常基于固定短时间间隔建模，依赖朴素自回归进行长期预测，存在两个关键局限：1）难以充分建模全球天气系统的空间和多尺度时间依赖；2）滚动策略难以平衡误差累积与精细大气变化捕捉。

Method: 构建多间隔预测模型，使用共享-私有专家混合机制捕捉不同时间尺度的共享模式和特定特征，采用环形位置编码准确表示地球纬度结构，并基于强化学习开发自适应滚动调度器来选择最合适的时间间隔。

Result: 实验结果表明ARROW在全球天气预测中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ARROW为天气预测领域建立了一个有前景的新范式。

Abstract: Weather forecasting is a fundamental task in spatiotemporal data analysis,
with broad applications across a wide range of domains. Existing data-driven
forecasting methods typically model atmospheric dynamics over a fixed short
time interval (e.g., 6 hours) and rely on naive autoregression-based rollout
for long-term forecasting (e.g., 138 hours). However, this paradigm suffers
from two key limitations: (1) it often inadequately models the spatial and
multi-scale temporal dependencies inherent in global weather systems, and (2)
the rollout strategy struggles to balance error accumulation with the capture
of fine-grained atmospheric variations. In this study, we propose ARROW, an
Adaptive-Rollout Multi-scale temporal Routing method for Global Weather
Forecasting. To contend with the first limitation, we construct a
multi-interval forecasting model that forecasts weather across different time
intervals. Within the model, the Shared-Private Mixture-of-Experts captures
both shared patterns and specific characteristics of atmospheric dynamics
across different time scales, while Ring Positional Encoding accurately encodes
the circular latitude structure of the Earth when representing spatial
information. For the second limitation, we develop an adaptive rollout
scheduler based on reinforcement learning, which selects the most suitable time
interval to forecast according to the current weather state. Experimental
results demonstrate that ARROW achieves state-of-the-art performance in global
weather forecasting, establishing a promising paradigm in this field.

Motivation: 企业间关系识别对金融分析和公司治理至关重要，但面临数据规模大、稀疏性和上下文依赖等挑战。图方法能捕捉结构但缺乏语义深度，LLM擅长文本但难以表示关系依赖。

Method: 提出InterCorpRel-LLM框架，整合GNN和LLM，使用FactSet供应链记录构建专有数据集，设计三个训练任务：公司图匹配、行业分类和供应关系预测。

Result: 在供应关系识别任务上F-score达到0.8543，显著优于GPT-5的0.2287，仅使用7B参数骨干网络和轻量训练。模型还能零样本泛化到竞争者识别任务。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效建模结构和语义，为分析师和策略师提供强大的工具来映射和推理复杂的企业网络，增强动态市场中的决策和风险管理。

Abstract: Identifying inter-firm relationships such as supply and competitive ties is
critical for financial analysis and corporate governance, yet remains
challenging due to the scale, sparsity, and contextual dependence of corporate
data. Graph-based methods capture structure but miss semantic depth, while
large language models (LLMs) excel at text but remain limited in their ability
to represent relational dependencies. To address this, we propose
InterCorpRel-LLM, a cross-modal framework that integrates GNNs with LLMs,
supported by a proprietary dataset derived from FactSet supply chain records
and three tailored training tasks: company graph matching, industry
classification, and supply relation prediction. This design enables effective
joint modeling of structure and semantics. Experiments show that
InterCorpRel-LLM substantially outperforms strong baselines, including GPT-5,
on a supply relation identification task, achieving an F-score of 0.8543 vs.
0.2287 with only a 7B-parameter backbone and lightweight training. The model
also generalizes to zero-shot competitor identification, underscoring its
ability to capture nuanced inter-firm dynamics. Our framework thus provides
analysts and strategists with a robust tool for mapping and reasoning about
complex corporate networks, enhancing decision-making and risk management in
dynamic markets.

Motivation: 验证词汇假说，探索机器学习是否能替代传统人格理论模型，检验Big Five模型在在线环境中的生态效度。

Method: 从经典形容词列表使用机器学习构建自下而上的人格模型，分析100万条Reddit评论，与Big Five模型进行对比评估。

Result: Big Five模型（特别是宜人性、尽责性和神经质）对在线社区提供了更强大和可解释的描述；机器学习聚类未能提供有意义的区分，未能恢复外向性特质，缺乏Big Five的心理测量一致性。

Conclusion: Big Five模型具有稳健性，人格的语义结构是情境依赖的；机器学习可以检验已有心理学理论的生态效度，但可能无法替代这些理论。

Abstract: The lexical hypothesis posits that personality traits are encoded in language
and is foundational to models like the Big Five. We created a bottom-up
personality model from a classic adjective list using machine learning and
compared its descriptive utility against the Big Five by analyzing one million
Reddit comments. The Big Five, particularly Agreeableness, Conscientiousness,
and Neuroticism, provided a far more powerful and interpretable description of
these online communities. In contrast, our machine-learning clusters provided
no meaningful distinctions, failed to recover the Extraversion trait, and
lacked the psychometric coherence of the Big Five. These results affirm the
robustness of the Big Five and suggest personality's semantic structure is
context-dependent. Our findings show that while machine learning can help check
the ecological validity of established psychological theories, it may not be
able to replace them.

*Atharv Goel,Sharat Agarwal,Saket Anand,Chetan Arora*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NCAL-R是一个基于神经崩溃几何的可靠主动学习框架，通过类均值对齐扰动和特征波动两个几何信号来对抗不可靠的监督，在噪声标签和分布偏移下表现优于传统主动学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主动学习方法在标签噪声和数据分布偏移时不可靠，因为不确定性、多样性等启发式方法会放大错误标签或冗余样本的影响。

Method: 提出两个互补的几何信号：类均值对齐扰动分数（量化候选样本对类间几何结构的稳定或扭曲程度）和特征波动分数（捕捉训练检查点间表示的时间不稳定性）。

Result: 在ImageNet-100和CIFAR100上的实验表明，NCAL-R在合成标签噪声下具有更高的准确率和更强的鲁棒性，对分布外数据也有更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 将几何可靠性标准纳入主动学习的样本选择决策中，可以减少对标注错误和分布偏移的脆弱性，是实现可信赖部署的关键步骤。

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) promises to reduce annotation cost by prioritizing
informative samples, yet its reliability is undermined when labels are noisy or
when the data distribution shifts. In practice, annotators make mistakes, rare
categories are ambiguous, and conventional AL heuristics (uncertainty,
diversity) often amplify such errors by repeatedly selecting mislabeled or
redundant samples. We propose Reliable Active Learning via Neural Collapse
Geometry (NCAL-R), a framework that leverages the emergent geometric
regularities of deep networks to counteract unreliable supervision. Our method
introduces two complementary signals: (i) a Class-Mean Alignment Perturbation
score, which quantifies how candidate samples structurally stabilize or distort
inter-class geometry, and (ii) a Feature Fluctuation score, which captures
temporal instability of representations across training checkpoints. By
combining these signals, NCAL-R prioritizes samples that both preserve class
separation and highlight ambiguous regions, mitigating the effect of noisy or
redundant labels. Experiments on ImageNet-100 and CIFAR100 show that NCAL-R
consistently outperforms standard AL baselines, achieving higher accuracy with
fewer labels, improved robustness under synthetic label noise, and stronger
generalization to out-of-distribution data. These results suggest that
incorporating geometric reliability criteria into acquisition decisions can
make Active Learning less brittle to annotation errors and distribution shifts,
a key step toward trustworthy deployment in real-world labeling pipelines. Our
code is available at https://github.com/Vision-IIITD/NCAL.

Abstract: Patent drafting is complex due to its need for detailed technical
descriptions, legal compliance, and visual elements. Although Large Vision
Language Models (LVLMs) show promise across various tasks, their application in
automating patent writing remains underexplored. In this paper, we present
PatentVision, a multimodal framework that integrates textual and visual inputs
such as patent claims and drawings to generate complete patent specifications.
Built on advanced LVLMs, PatentVision enhances accuracy by combining fine tuned
vision language models with domain specific training tailored to patents.
Experiments reveal it surpasses text only methods, producing outputs with
greater fidelity and alignment with human written standards. Its incorporation
of visual data allows it to better represent intricate design features and
functional connections, leading to richer and more precise results. This study
underscores the value of multimodal techniques in patent automation, providing
a scalable tool to reduce manual workloads and improve consistency.
PatentVision not only advances patent drafting but also lays the groundwork for
broader use of LVLMs in specialized areas, potentially transforming
intellectual property management and innovation processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态自监督学习方法依赖CLIP式对比目标，容易过拟合到易对齐特征，并将有效跨模态关系误判为负样本，导致碎片化且不可泛化的嵌入

Method: 引入共享原型字典，将异构模态锚定在共同嵌入空间中，通过围绕共享原型聚类表示而非显式负采样

Result: 在Pulse Motion基础模型上超越仅对比学习和先前多模态SSL方法，达到最先进性能，同时提供更好的特征可解释性

Conclusion: ProtoMM框架能有效捕捉跨模态互补信息，为生理信号提供连贯的"共同语言"

Abstract: Modeling multi-modal time-series data is critical for capturing system-level
dynamics, particularly in biosignals where modalities such as ECG, PPG, EDA,
and accelerometry provide complementary perspectives on interconnected
physiological processes. While recent self-supervised learning (SSL) advances
have improved unimodal representation learning, existing multi-modal approaches
often rely on CLIP-style contrastive objectives that overfit to easily aligned
features and misclassify valid cross-modal relationships as negatives,
resulting in fragmented and non-generalizable embeddings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ProtoMM, a novel SSL framework that introduces a shared
prototype dictionary to anchor heterogeneous modalities in a common embedding
space. By clustering representations around shared prototypes rather than
explicit negative sampling, our method captures complementary information
across modalities and provides a coherent "common language" for physiological
signals. In this work, we focus on developing a Pulse Motion foundation model
with ProtoMM and demonstrate that our approach outperforms contrastive-only and
prior multimodal SSL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance while
offering improved interpretability of learned features.

TL;DR: 提出HeSRN，一种用于异构图表示学习的高效表达性模型，通过槽感知结构编码器和保留机制解决传统图Transformer的二次计算复杂度和语义混合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图Transformer在捕捉长程依赖方面表现出色，但其二次计算复杂度和无法有效建模异构语义的问题限制了其在真实世界异构图上的可扩展性和泛化能力。

Method: 引入槽感知结构编码器，通过将异构特征投影到独立槽中并使用槽归一化和保留融合来解耦节点类型语义；用保留编码器替代自注意力机制，实现线性时间复杂度的结构依赖建模；使用异构保留编码器联合捕捉局部结构信号和全局异构语义。

Conclusion: HeSRN通过有效解耦异构语义和线性复杂度建模，为异构图表示学习提供了一种高效且表达性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Transformers have recently achieved remarkable progress in graph
representation learning by capturing long-range dependencies through
self-attention. However, their quadratic computational complexity and inability
to effectively model heterogeneous semantics severely limit their scalability
and generalization on real-world heterogeneous graphs. To address these issues,
we propose HeSRN, a novel Heterogeneous Slot-aware Retentive Network for
efficient and expressive heterogeneous graph representation learning. HeSRN
introduces a slot-aware structure encoder that explicitly disentangles
node-type semantics by projecting heterogeneous features into independent slots
and aligning their distributions through slot normalization and retention-based
fusion, effectively mitigating the semantic entanglement caused by forced
feature-space unification in previous Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we
replace the self-attention mechanism with a retention-based encoder, which
models structural and contextual dependencies in linear time complexity while
maintaining strong expressive power. A heterogeneous retentive encoder is
further employed to jointly capture both local structural signals and global
heterogeneous semantics through multi-scale retention layers. Extensive
experiments on four real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that
HeSRN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph neural
networks and Graph Transformer baselines on node classification tasks,
achieving superior accuracy with significantly lower computational complexity.

Method: 通过经验研究分析不同架构在数据、参数和计算量方面的幂律扩展行为，比较等变与非等变架构的扩展表现。

Result: 等变架构比非等变模型扩展性更好，高阶表示对应更优的扩展指数。计算最优训练需要数据和模型规模同步增长。

Conclusion: 不应让模型自行发现对称性等基本归纳偏置，尤其是在扩展时，因为这些偏置会改变任务的内在难度和扩展规律。

Abstract: We present an empirical study in the geometric task of learning interatomic
potentials, which shows equivariance matters even more at larger scales; we
show a clear power-law scaling behaviour with respect to data, parameters and
compute with ``architecture-dependent exponents''. In particular, we observe
that equivariant architectures, which leverage task symmetry, scale better than
non-equivariant models. Moreover, among equivariant architectures, higher-order
representations translate to better scaling exponents. Our analysis also
suggests that for compute-optimal training, the data and model sizes should
scale in tandem regardless of the architecture. At a high level, these results
suggest that, contrary to common belief, we should not leave it to the model to
discover fundamental inductive biases such as symmetry, especially as we scale,
because they change the inherent difficulty of the task and its scaling laws.

Abstract: Fingerprinting Radio Frequency (RF) emitters typically involves finding
unique emitter characteristics that are featured in their transmitted signals.
These fingerprints are nuanced but sufficiently detailed, motivating the
pursuit of methods that can successfully extract them. The most granular
downstream task is known as Specific Emitter Identification (SEI), which
requires a well informed RF fingerprinting (RFF) approach for it to be
successful. RFF and SEI have a long history, with numerous application areas in
defence and civilian contexts such as signal intelligence, electronic
surveillance, physical-layer authentication of wireless communication devices,
to name a few. RFF methods also support many other downstream tasks such as
Emitter Data Association (EDA) and RF Emitter Clustering (RFEC) and are
applicable to a range of transmission types. In recent years, data-driven
approaches have become popular in the RFF domain due to their ability to
automatically learn intricate fingerprints from raw data. These methods
generally deliver superior performance when compared to traditional techniques.
The more traditional approaches are often labour-intensive, inflexible and only
applicable to a particular emitter type or transmission scheme. Therefore, we
consider data-driven Machine Learning (ML)-enabled RFF. In particular, we
propose a generic framework for ML-enabled RFF which is inclusive of several
popular downstream tasks such as SEI, EDA and RFEC. Each task is formulated as
a RF fingerprint-dependent task. A variety of use cases using real RF datasets
are presented here to demonstrate the framework for a range of tasks and
application areas, such as spaceborne surveillance, signal intelligence and
countering drones.

TL;DR: 本文通过理论分析揭示了Transformer在时间序列预测中的局限性，证明线性自注意力模型在AR(p)数据下无法超越经典线性模型，并分析了渐近行为和思维链推理的崩溃现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管近期大量研究使用基于Transformer的大语言模型进行时间序列预测，但实证表明这些复杂模型往往无法超越简单的线性模型。本文旨在从理论上理解这一现象，填补理论认知的空白。

Method: 通过上下文学习理论框架，在AR(p)数据假设下，对线性自注意力模型进行理论分析，包括期望MSE比较、渐近行为分析和思维链推理的崩溃分析。

Result: 理论证明：(1)线性自注意力模型无法在期望MSE上超越经典线性模型；(2)当上下文长度趋于无穷时，线性自注意力渐近恢复最优线性预测器；(3)在思维链推理下，预测会指数级崩溃到均值。这些发现通过精心设计的实验得到验证。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了Transformer在时间序列预测中的根本理论局限，建议研究社区重新审视时间序列预测的基本理论限制，并在应用复杂架构时进行更深入的审视。

Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) remains a challenging and largely unsolved
problem in machine learning, despite significant recent efforts leveraging
Large Language Models (LLMs), which predominantly rely on Transformer
architectures. Empirical evidence consistently shows that even powerful
Transformers often fail to outperform much simpler models, e.g., linear models,
on TSF tasks; however, a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon
remains limited. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of
Transformers' limitations for TSF through the lens of In-Context Learning (ICL)
theory. Specifically, under AR($p$) data, we establish that: (1) Linear
Self-Attention (LSA) models $\textit{cannot}$ achieve lower expected MSE than
classical linear models for in-context forecasting; (2) as the context length
approaches to infinity, LSA asymptotically recovers the optimal linear
predictor; and (3) under Chain-of-Thought (CoT) style inference, predictions
collapse to the mean exponentially. We empirically validate these findings
through carefully designed experiments. Our theory not only sheds light on
several previously underexplored phenomena but also offers practical insights
for designing more effective forecasting architectures. We hope our work
encourages the broader research community to revisit the fundamental
theoretical limitations of TSF and to critically evaluate the direct
application of increasingly sophisticated architectures without deeper
scrutiny.

Abstract: Time series AI is crucial for analyzing dynamic web content, driving a surge
of pre-trained large models known for their strong knowledge encoding and
transfer capabilities across diverse tasks. However, given their
energy-intensive training, inference, and hardware demands, using large models
as a one-fits-all solution raises serious concerns about carbon footprint and
sustainability. For a specific task, a compact yet specialized, high-performing
model may be more practical and affordable, especially for resource-constrained
users such as small businesses. This motivates the question: Can we build
cost-effective lightweight models with large-model-like performance on core
tasks such as forecasting? This paper addresses this question by introducing
SVTime, a novel Small model inspired by large Vision model (LVM) forecasters
for long-term Time series forecasting (LTSF). Recently, LVMs have been shown as
powerful tools for LTSF. We identify a set of key inductive biases of LVM
forecasters -- analogous to the "physics" governing their behaviors in LTSF --
and design small models that encode these biases through meticulously crafted
linear layers and constraint functions. Across 21 baselines spanning
lightweight, complex, and pre-trained large models on 8 benchmark datasets,
SVTime outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) lightweight models and rivals large
models with 10^3 fewer parameters than LVMs, while enabling efficient training
and inference in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: 为更安全的智能体系统提供了实用模板，通过填补数据、模型和评估三个关键空白，实现了在规划阶段的有效安全干预。

Abstract: While LLM agents can plan multi-step tasks, intervening at the planning
stage-before any action is executed-is often the safest way to prevent harm,
since certain risks can lead to severe consequences once carried out. However,
existing guardrails mostly operate post-execution, which is difficult to scale
and leaves little room for controllable supervision at the plan level. To
address this challenge, we highlight three critical gaps in current research:
data gap, model gap, and evaluation gap. To close the data gap, we introduce
AuraGen, a controllable engine that (i) synthesizes benign trajectories, (ii)
injects category-labeled risks with calibrated difficulty, and (iii) filters
outputs via an automated reward model, producing large and reliable corpora for
pre-execution safety. To close the guardian model gap, we propose a
foundational guardrail Safiron, combining a cross-planner adapter with a
compact guardian model. The adapter unifies different input formats, while
Safiron flags risky cases, assigns risk types, and generates rationales;
trained in two stages with a broadly explored data recipe, Safiron achieves
robust transfer across settings. To close the evaluation gap, we release
Pre-Exec Bench, a realistic benchmark covering diverse tools and branching
trajectories, which measures detection, fine-grained categorization,
explanation, and cross-planner generalization in human-verified scenarios.
Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains of the proposed guardrail
over strong baselines on Pre-Exec Bench, and ablations further distill
actionable practices, providing a practical template for safer agentic systems.

Conclusion: 该方法通过熵基理论分析证明能够促进生成样本的多样性，解决了现有LLM过采样方法多样性不足的问题。

Abstract: Oversampling is one of the most widely used approaches for addressing
imbalanced classification. The core idea is to generate additional minority
samples to rebalance the dataset. Most existing methods, such as SMOTE, require
converting categorical variables into numerical vectors, which often leads to
information loss. Recently, large language model (LLM)-based methods have been
introduced to overcome this limitation. However, current LLM-based approaches
typically generate minority samples with limited diversity, reducing robustness
and generalizability in downstream classification tasks. To address this gap,
we propose a novel LLM-based oversampling method designed to enhance diversity.
First, we introduce a sampling strategy that conditions synthetic sample
generation on both minority labels and features. Second, we develop a new
permutation strategy for fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs. Third, we fine-tune the
LLM not only on minority samples but also on interpolated samples to further
enrich variability. Extensive experiments on 10 tabular datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms eight SOTA baselines. The generated
synthetic samples are both realistic and diverse. Moreover, we provide
theoretical analysis through an entropy-based perspective, proving that our
method encourages diversity in the generated samples.

Conclusion: D-SPIB提供了一个灵活的架构，能够学习连贯有用的热力学内部表示，并整合来自不同分子模拟轨迹的温度信息。

Abstract: Generative modeling becomes increasingly data-intensive in high-dimensional
spaces. In molecular science, where data collection is expensive and important
events are rare, compression to lower-dimensional manifolds is especially
important for various downstream tasks, including generation. We combine a
time-lagged information bottleneck designed to characterize molecular important
representations and a diffusion model in one joint training objective. The
resulting protocol, which we term Diffusive State Predictive Information
Bottleneck (D-SPIB), enables the balancing of representation learning and
generation aims in one flexible architecture. Additionally, the model is
capable of combining temperature information from different molecular
simulation trajectories to learn a coherent and useful internal representation
of thermodynamics. We benchmark D-SPIB on multiple molecular tasks and showcase
its potential for exploring physical conditions outside the training set.

Abstract: Neural operators are becoming the default tools to learn solutions to
governing partial differential equations (PDEs) in weather and ocean
forecasting applications. Despite early promising achievements, significant
challenges remain, including long-term prediction stability and adherence to
physical laws, particularly for high-frequency processes. In this paper, we
take a step toward addressing these challenges in high-resolution ocean
prediction by incorporating temporal Fourier modes, demonstrating how this
modification enhances physical fidelity. This study compares the standard
Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) with its variant, FNOtD, which has been modified
to internalize the dispersion relation while learning the solution operator for
ocean PDEs. The results demonstrate that entangling space and time in the
training of integral kernels enables the model to capture multiscale wave
propagation and effectively learn ocean dynamics. FNOtD substantially improves
long-term prediction stability and consistency with underlying physical
dynamics in challenging high-frequency settings compared to the standard FNO.
It also provides competitive predictive skill relative to a state-of-the-art
numerical ocean model, while requiring significantly lower computational cost.

TL;DR: 该研究揭示了在视觉Transformer中，信息的可解码性和因果影响之间存在系统性不匹配：中间层的对象token具有强因果影响但弱可解码性，而最终层的对象token可准确解码但功能惰性。


<details>

Motivation: 机制可解释性研究旨在理解神经网络内部组件如何产生预测，但经常混淆两个概念：可解码性（从隐藏状态恢复信息的能力）和因果性（这些状态对输出的功能影响程度）。

Method: 在用于对象计数的ViT中，使用激活修补技术测试空间和CLS token的因果作用，同时训练线性探针评估不同深度的计数信息可解码性。

Result: 发现中间层对象token具有强因果影响但弱可解码性，最终层对象token支持准确解码但功能惰性。CLS token在中间层可解码，但仅在最终层获得因果能力。

Conclusion: 可解码性和因果性反映了表征的互补维度——存在什么信息与使用什么信息——它们的分歧可以揭示隐藏的计算电路。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability seeks to uncover how internal components of
neural networks give rise to predictions. A persistent challenge, however, is
disentangling two often conflated notions: decodability--the recoverability of
information from hidden states--and causality--the extent to which those states
functionally influence outputs. In this work, we investigate their relationship
in vision transformers (ViTs) fine-tuned for object counting. Using activation
patching, we test the causal role of spatial and CLS tokens by transplanting
activations across clean-corrupted image pairs. In parallel, we train linear
probes to assess the decodability of count information at different depths. Our
results reveal systematic mismatches: middle-layer object tokens exert strong
causal influence despite being weakly decodable, whereas final-layer object
tokens support accurate decoding yet are functionally inert. Similarly, the CLS
token becomes decodable in mid-layers but only acquires causal power in the
final layers. These findings highlight that decodability and causality reflect
complementary dimensions of representation--what information is present versus

### [498] [Temporal Lifting as Latent-Space Regularization for Continuous-Time Flow Models in AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09805)
*Jeffrey Camlin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为"时间提升"的潜在空间自适应时间重参数化方法，用于连续时间动力系统，通过光滑单调映射正则化流动的奇异行为并保持守恒定律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决连续时间动力系统中近奇异行为的正则化问题，同时保持系统的守恒定律，为机器学习动力学提供稳定化方法。

Method: 引入光滑单调映射t↦τ(t)进行时间重参数化，在提升坐标中使轨迹全局光滑，作为连续时间归一化或时间扭曲算子。

Result: 该方法能使不可压缩Navier-Stokes方程在环面T³上的轨迹变得全局光滑，并能稳定物理信息神经网络和其他潜在流架构。

Conclusion: 时间提升框架将解析正则性理论与表示学习方法联系起来，为处理刚性或湍流过程提供了新途径。

Abstract: We present a latent-space formulation of adaptive temporal reparametrization
for continuous-time dynamical systems. The method, called *temporal lifting*,
introduces a smooth monotone mapping $t \mapsto \tau(t)$ that regularizes
near-singular behavior of the underlying flow while preserving its conservation
laws. In the lifted coordinate, trajectories such as those of the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on the torus $\mathbb{T}^3$ become
globally smooth. From the standpoint of machine-learning dynamics, temporal
lifting acts as a continuous-time normalization or time-warping operator that
can stabilize physics-informed neural networks and other latent-flow
architectures used in AI systems. The framework links analytic regularity
theory with representation-learning methods for stiff or turbulent processes.

*Mohsen Joneidi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Decomposer Networks (DecompNet) 是一种语义自编码器，通过并行分支和残差输入分解输入为多个可解释组件，实现组件间的显式竞争。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自编码器将输入压缩为单一潜在表示，而DecompNet旨在分解输入为多个语义上有意义的组件，提供更可解释的表示。

Method: 采用N个并行分支，每个分支处理原始信号减去其他分支重构的残差输入，通过展开Gauss-Seidel风格块坐标下降为可微分网络。

Result: 模型实现了组件间的显式竞争，产生简洁且语义上有意义的表示，是首个实现"除一之外"残差更新规则的语义自编码器。

Conclusion: DecompNet在分解输入为可解释组件方面具有创新性，为语义自编码器提供了新的实现方法。

Abstract: We propose the Decomposer Networks (DecompNet), a semantic autoencoder that
factorizes an input into multiple interpretable components. Unlike classical
autoencoders that compress an input into a single latent representation, the
Decomposer Network maintains N parallel branches, each assigned a residual
input defined as the original signal minus the reconstructions of all other
branches. By unrolling a Gauss--Seidel style block-coordinate descent into a
differentiable network, DecompNet enforce explicit competition among
components, yielding parsimonious, semantically meaningful representations. We
situate our model relative to linear decomposition methods (PCA, NMF), deep
unrolled optimization, and object-centric architectures (MONet, IODINE, Slot
Attention), and highlight its novelty as the first semantic autoencoder to
implement an all-but-one residual update rule.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统探索了神经网络中跨层范数聚合方法，将Adam和Muon形式化为非欧几里得梯度下降，并提出了新的MuonMax变体。研究发现MuonMax对学习率选择更稳健，结合Momo动量后进一步提升了鲁棒性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在神经网络中定义最速下降方法，需要为每层选择范数、跨层范数聚合方式以及是否使用归一化。本文旨在系统探索这些选择，改进优化器的鲁棒性。

Method: 将Adam和Muon形式化为非欧几里得梯度下降，推导新的Muon变体，并通过综合实验评估不同优化器。还将非欧几里得梯度方法与模型动量(Momo)结合。

Result: Muon对学习率选择敏感，而新提出的MuonMax显著更稳健。结合Momo的Muon变体对超参数调优更鲁棒，通常获得更好的验证分数。

Conclusion: 对于新任务，建议使用Momo与MuonMax组合，以节省昂贵的超参数调优成本。

Abstract: To define a steepest descent method over a neural network, we need to choose
a norm for each layer, a way to aggregate these norms across layers, and
whether to use normalization. We systematically explore different alternatives
for aggregating norms across layers, both formalizing existing combinations of
Adam and the recently proposed Muon as a type of non-Euclidean gradient
descent, and deriving new variants of the Muon optimizer. Through a
comprehensive experimental evaluation of the optimizers within our framework,
we find that Muon is sensitive to the choice of learning rate, whereas a new
variant we call MuonMax is significantly more robust. We then show how to
combine any non-Euclidean gradient method with model based momentum (known as
Momo). The new Momo variants of Muon are significantly more robust to
hyperparameter tuning, and often achieve a better validation score. Thus for
new tasks, where the optimal hyperparameters are not known, we advocate for
using Momo in combination with MuonMax to save on costly hyperparameter tuning.

TL;DR: CALM是一个专门为表格数据设计的因果分析语言模型，通过Mamba架构和多种证据整合，在复杂系统中实现高精度因果发现，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现方法存在无法确定因果方向、仅限于线性关系、对忠实性假设敏感等问题，而大语言模型虽具备强大推理能力但不适用于表格数据格式。

Method: 采用Mamba架构的CALM模型，整合局部因果评分、条件独立性检验和关系属性等多种证据，在合成数据和真实生物数据集上进行训练。

Result: 在模拟研究中准确率超过91%，在丙型肝炎病毒进展的因果因素识别等真实应用中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作成功将语言模型的模式识别能力应用于表格数据的因果发现，代表了向准确且可泛化因果发现的重要进展。

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data is fundamental to scientific fields
like biology, where controlled experiments are often impractical. However,
existing methods, including constraint-based (e.g., PC, causalMGM) and
score-based approaches (e.g., NOTEARS), face significant limitations. These
include an inability to resolve causal direction, restrictions to linear
associations, sensitivity to violations of the faithfulness assumption, and
inefficiency in searching vast hypothesis spaces. While large language models
(LLMs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities, their application is hindered by
a fundamental discrepancy: they are designed for text, while most causal data
is tabular. To address these challenges, we introduce CALM, a novel causal
analysis language model specifically designed for tabular data in complex
systems. CALM leverages a Mamba-based architecture to classify causal patterns
from pairwise variable relationships. It integrates a comprehensive suite of
evidence, including local causal scores, conditional independence tests, and
relational attributes, to capture a wide spectrum of linear, nonlinear, and
conditional causal mechanisms. Trained on a diverse corpus of synthetic data
(from linear, mixed, and nonlinear models) and 10 real-world biological
datasets with rigorously validated causal relationships, our model ensures
robustness and generalizability. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that CALM
significantly outperforms existing methods in both simulation studies,
achieving over 91% accuracy, and in a real-world application identifying causal
factors in Hepatitis C virus progression. This work represents a significant
step towards accurate and generalizable causal discovery by successfully
adapting the pattern recognition capabilities of language models to the
intricacies of tabular data.

TL;DR: ProxRouter是一种非参数化的LLM查询路由器，通过指数倾斜聚合机制平衡偏差和方差，提高了对异常查询的路由鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的参数化路由器需要重新训练和维护，非参数化路由器虽然无需训练，但在处理异常查询时泛化能力差，且训练集多样性有限难以扩展。

Method: 采用指数倾斜聚合机制来平衡非参数化路由器中的偏差和方差，提高对异常查询的路由鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明ProxRouter在保持正常查询性能的同时，显著提升了异常查询的路由效果，且开销最小。

Conclusion: ProxRouter通过创新的聚合机制有效解决了非参数化路由器在处理异常查询时的泛化问题，具有实用价值。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) query routers are critical to modern AI platforms
as they seek to improve efficiency by assigning inference queries to accurate,
yet low-cost models. Parametric routers typically use trained neural networks
for LLM selection but suffer from retraining and maintenance overheads.
Nonparametric routers are training-free, instead estimating LLM accuracy and
cost via similarity between encodings of the input query and training set
queries. However, like their parametric counterparts, nonparametric routers
struggle to generalize to outlier queries, an issue exacerbated by limited
diversity in training sets which are costly to expand and difficult to keep
current with ever-evolving use cases. We propose ProxRouter, which applies an
exponentially tilted aggregation mechanism to balance bias and variance in
nonparametric routers, improving their robustness to outliers. Experiments show
ProxRouter enhances outlier routing while preserving inlier performance with
minimal overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试未能充分评估AI代理在网页子任务上的能力，而这些子任务对于鲁棒的网页规划和导航至关重要。

Method: 使用Web ARChive文件实现沙盒化的动态网页交互，探索监督微调(SFT)和带可验证奖励的强化学习(RLVR)两种训练方法。

Result: SFT模型在基准测试中达到48.8%的成功率，RLVR在SFT基础上提升至52.8%，优于许多前沿模型。最高观察到的成功率为64.8%。

Conclusion: 掌握网页子任务对于鲁棒的网页导航至关重要，这是现有基准测试未充分评估的能力。

Abstract: Training web agents to navigate complex, real-world websites requires them to
master $\textit{subtasks}$ - short-horizon interactions on multiple UI
components (e.g., choosing the correct date in a date picker, or scrolling in a
container to extract information). We introduce WARC-Bench (Web Archive
Benchmark), a novel web navigation benchmark featuring 438 tasks designed to
evaluate multimodal AI agents on subtasks. WARC-Bench enables sandboxed
interactions with dynamic and realistic webpages using Web ARChive files. We
show that WARC-Bench is challenging for leading computer-use models, with the
highest observed success rate being 64.8%. To improve open source models on
subtask, we explore two common training techniques: supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). Experiments
show that SFT models obtain a 48.8% success rate on the benchmark. Training
with RLVR over SFT checkpoints, even in data-scarce settings, improves the
score to 52.8% on WARC-Bench, outperforming many frontier models. Our analysis
concludes that mastering these subtasks is essential for robust web planning
and navigation, and is a capability not extensively evaluated by existing
benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有主动学习获取函数众多，但缺乏统一的理论指导原则，且在大批量采样时面临计算挑战或性能下降问题。

Method: 基于贝叶斯决策理论推导主动学习算法，包括EER、EPIG等，并针对大批量采样问题提出了ParBaLS EPIG方法。

Result: 实验表明ParBaLS EPIG在固定预算和贝叶斯逻辑回归神经网络嵌入上，在多个数据集上表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯决策理论为主动学习提供了统一框架，ParBaLS EPIG有效解决了大批量采样问题，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Over the past couple of decades, many active learning acquisition functions
have been proposed, leaving practitioners with an unclear choice of which to
use. Bayesian Decision Theory (BDT) offers a universal principle to guide
decision-making. In this work, we derive BDT for (Bayesian) active learning in
the myopic framework, where we imagine we only have one more point to label.
This derivation leads to effective algorithms such as Expected Error Reduction
(EER), Expected Predictive Information Gain (EPIG), and other algorithms that
appear in the literature. Furthermore, we show that BAIT (active learning based
on V-optimal experimental design) can be derived from BDT and asymptotic
approximations. A key challenge of such methods is the difficult scaling to
large batch sizes, leading to either computational challenges (BatchBALD) or
dramatic performance drops (top-$B$ selection). Here, using a particular
formulation of the decision process, we derive Partial Batch Label Sampling
(ParBaLS) for the EPIG algorithm. We show experimentally for several datasets
that ParBaLS EPIG gives superior performance for a fixed budget and Bayesian
Logistic Regression on Neural Embeddings. Our code is available at

TL;DR: TAWRMAC是一个新颖的连续时间动态图表示学习框架，通过整合时间匿名游走、内存增强和邻居共现嵌入，解决了现有方法在嵌入陈旧性、邻居相关性捕获和结构动态建模方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有连续时间动态图方法存在三个关键挑战：(1)仅依赖节点特定内存而未能有效整合邻居信息导致嵌入陈旧；(2)未能显式捕获节点邻居间的相关性，限制了上下文感知能力；(3)在缺乏丰富链接属性的情况下无法充分捕捉演化图的结构动态。

Method: TAWRMAC框架整合了三种核心机制：带重启的时间匿名游走、内存增强和邻居共现嵌入。通过内存增强的GNN与固定时间编码提高嵌入稳定性，显式捕获邻居相关性以改进上下文表示，时间匿名游走机制区分重复交互节点与形成新连接的节点。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，TAWRMAC在动态链接预测和节点分类任务上，在转导和归纳两种设置下，以及三种不同的负采样策略下，始终优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: TAWRMAC通过提供稳定、可泛化和上下文感知的嵌入，推进了连续时间动态图学习的技术水平，支持强大的归纳学习能力。

Abstract: Dynamic graph representation learning has become essential for analyzing
evolving networks in domains such as social network analysis, recommendation
systems, and traffic analysis. However, existing continuous-time methods face
three key challenges: (1) some methods depend solely on node-specific memory
without effectively incorporating information from neighboring nodes, resulting
in embedding staleness; (2) most fail to explicitly capture correlations
between node neighborhoods, limiting contextual awareness; and (3) many fail to
fully capture the structural dynamics of evolving graphs, especially in absence
of rich link attributes. To address these limitations, we introduce TAWRMAC-a
novel framework that integrates Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart, Memory
Augmentation, and Neighbor Co-occurrence embedding. TAWRMAC enhances embedding
stability through a memory-augmented GNN with fixedtime encoding and improves
contextual representation by explicitly capturing neighbor correlations.
Additionally, its Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart mechanism distinguishes
between nodes exhibiting repetitive interactions and those forming new
connections beyond their immediate neighborhood. This approach captures
structural dynamics better and supports strong inductive learning. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that TAWRMAC
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in dynamic link prediction
and node classification under both transductive and inductive settings across
three different negative sampling strategies. By providing stable,
generalizable, and context-aware embeddings, TAWRMAC advances the state of the
art in continuous-time dynamic graph learning. The code is available at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/tawrmac-A253 .

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在重尾噪声下的鲁棒非参数回归，使用Huber回归作为示例，提出了基于预测误差而非泛化误差的学习能力评估方法，并建立了新的比较定理和有限样本误差界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统鲁棒学习的泛化误差界不能真实反映样本外性能，且在无界函数空间和重尾噪声下，标准浓度工具失效，需要新的分析框架。

Method: 使用Tikhonov正则化风险最小化在再生核希尔伯特空间中，引入概率有效假设空间，建立比较定理连接鲁棒风险与L2预测误差，推导有限样本误差界。

Result: 建立了鲁棒风险与预测误差之间的比较关系，残余项为O(σ^{-2ε})，获得了无一致有界性和重尾噪声下的显式收敛速率。

Conclusion: 预测误差而非泛化风险应作为鲁棒学习分析的基本视角，研究提供了原则性的调参规则，并可扩展到其他鲁棒损失函数。

Abstract: We investigate robust nonparametric regression in the presence of
heavy-tailed noise, where the hypothesis class may contain unbounded functions
and robustness is ensured via a robust loss function $\ell_\sigma$. Using Huber
regression as a close-up example within Tikhonov-regularized risk minimization
in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), we address two central challenges:
(i) the breakdown of standard concentration tools under weak moment
assumptions, and (ii) the analytical difficulties introduced by unbounded
hypothesis spaces. Our first message is conceptual: conventional
generalization-error bounds for robust losses do not faithfully capture
out-of-sample performance. We argue that learnability should instead be
quantified through prediction error, namely the $L_2$-distance to the truth
$f^\star$, which is $\sigma$-independent and directly reflects the target of
robust estimation. To make this workable under unboundedness, we introduce a
\emph{probabilistic effective hypothesis space} that confines the estimator
with high probability and enables a meaningful bias--variance decomposition
under weak $(1+\epsilon)$-moment conditions. Technically, we establish new
comparison theorems linking the excess robust risk to the $L_2$ prediction
error up to a residual of order $\mathcal{O}(\sigma^{-2\epsilon})$, clarifying
the robustness--bias trade-off induced by the scale parameter $\sigma$.
Building on this, we derive explicit finite-sample error bounds and convergence
rates for Huber regression in RKHS that hold without uniform boundedness and
under heavy-tailed noise. Our study delivers principled tuning rules, extends
beyond Huber to other robust losses, and highlights prediction error, not
excess generalization risk, as the fundamental lens for analyzing robust
learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 北极海冰快速减少需要准确的季节性预测，但现有基于气候模型的预测系统存在系统性偏差和复杂时空误差，传统确定性后处理方法无法充分量化不确定性。

Method: 使用条件变分自编码器模型，将观测数据的条件分布映射到有偏模型预测，从而生成大量调整后的预报集合。

Result: 调整后的预报在校准度、与观测分布的接近程度以及误差方面均优于传统气候平均调整方法。

Conclusion: 该概率误差校正框架能够有效改善北极海冰浓度季节性预测的准确性和不确定性量化。

Abstract: Seasonal forecast of Arctic sea ice concentration is key to mitigate the
negative impact and assess potential opportunities posed by the rapid decline
of sea ice coverage. Seasonal prediction systems based on climate models often
show systematic biases and complex spatio-temporal errors that grow with the
forecasts. Consequently, operational predictions are routinely bias corrected
and calibrated using retrospective forecasts. For predictions of Arctic sea ice
concentration, error corrections are mainly based on one-to-one post-processing
methods including climatological mean or linear regression correction and, more
recently, machine learning. Such deterministic adjustments are confined at best
to the limited number of costly-to-run ensemble members of the raw forecast.
However, decision-making requires proper quantification of uncertainty and
likelihood of events, particularly of extremes. We introduce a probabilistic
error correction framework based on a conditional Variational Autoencoder model
to map the conditional distribution of observations given the biased model
prediction. This method naturally allows for generating large ensembles of
adjusted forecasts. We evaluate our model using deterministic and probabilistic
metrics and show that the adjusted forecasts are better calibrated, closer to
the observational distribution, and have smaller errors than climatological
mean adjusted forecasts.

TL;DR: 提出Chain-of-Influence (CoI)框架，通过多层注意力机制显式建模临床特征间的时间动态依赖关系，提高预测准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉临床时间序列数据中潜在的、时变的特征间依赖关系，无法明确建模一个临床变量如何随时间影响其他变量。

Method: 使用两层注意力架构：时间注意力层识别关键时间点，跨特征注意力层建模这些时间点上特征对后续特征的定向影响，构建时间展开的特征交互图。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集和慢性肾病队列上，CoI在预测准确性上显著优于现有方法，并能揭示具有临床意义的患者特异性疾病进展模式。

Conclusion: CoI框架提供了前所未有的透明度，能够追踪影响路径，展示任何时间点的任何特征如何直接或通过影响其他变量对最终预测做出贡献。

Abstract: Modeling clinical time-series data is hampered by the challenge of capturing
latent, time-varying dependencies among features. State-of-the-art approaches
often rely on black-box mechanisms or simple aggregation, failing to explicitly
model how the influence of one clinical variable propagates through others over
time. We propose $\textbf{Chain-of-Influence (CoI)}$, an interpretable deep
learning framework that constructs an explicit, time-unfolded graph of feature
interactions. CoI leverages a multi-level attention architecture: first, a
temporal attention layer identifies critical time points in a patient's record;
second, a cross-feature attention layer models the directed influence from
features at these time points to subsequent features. This design enables the
tracing of influence pathways, providing a granular audit trail that shows how
any feature at any time contributes to the final prediction, both directly and
through its influence on other variables. We evaluate CoI on mortality and
disease progression tasks using the MIMIC-IV dataset and a private chronic
kidney disease cohort. Our framework significantly outperforms existing methods
in predictive accuracy. More importantly, through case studies, we show that
CoI can uncover clinically meaningful, patient-specific patterns of disease
progression that are opaque to other models, offering unprecedented
transparency into the temporal and cross-feature dependencies that inform
clinical decision-making.

TL;DR: T2J是一个通过提示增强框架来改进LLM从PyTorch到JAX代码翻译的方法，通过构建修复后的数据集和结构化指导来提升翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PyTorch和JAX虽然都嵌入在Python中，但在核心设计、执行语义和生态系统成熟度上存在差异，JAX较新且公开代码较少，现有的评估方法在跨框架基准测试方面存在不足。

Method: 使用GPT-4o-mini生成初始JAX草案，通过专业开发者迭代修复构建修复数据集，然后构建增强提示来指导轻量级LLM进行翻译。

Result: T2J将GPT-4o-mini在CodeBLEU上的性能提升高达10%，在T2J FixCost Score上提升50%，在T2J CodeTrans Score上提升1.33分，在T2J Comparison Score上提升100%，生成的代码运行速度比基线快2.5倍。

Conclusion: T2J框架有效提升了LLM在PyTorch到JAX代码翻译中的性能，通过结构化指导和修复数据集显著改善了翻译质量和效率。

Abstract: Despite recent progress of large language models (LLMs) on code translation
among mainstream languages, translating PyTorch to JAX remains nontrivial. The
two libraries, though both embedded in Python, differ in core design, execution
semantics, and ecosystem maturity; JAX is newer and comparatively
underrepresented in public code, and parallel PyTorch--JAX corpora are limited.
Weaknesses in existing evaluation further complicate cross-framework
benchmarking. We present T2J, a prompt-augmentation framework that strengthens
LLM-based PyTorch to JAX translation. Our pipeline (i) assembles two PyTorch
sources -- the problem-solving set from TorchLeet (Aroori & Chien, 2025) and a
GitHub-derived set from CodeParrot (Wolf et al., 2022) -- and uses GPT-4o-mini
to produce initial JAX drafts; (ii) engages two professional developers to
iteratively repair those drafts until functional equivalence, yielding a
curated fixed-bug dataset of common errors and patches; and (iii) constructs
augmented prompts that inject structured guidance from these fixes to steer
lightweight LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini). We also introduce three metrics tailored
to PyTorch to JAX: T2J CodeTrans Score, T2J FixCost Score (an LLM-based
estimate of bug-fix effort), and T2J Comparison Score (LLM-as-judge).
Empirically, T2J raises GPT-4o-mini performance by up to 10% on CodeBLEU, 50%
on T2J FixCost Score, 1.33 points on T2J CodeTrans Score (0--4 scale), and 100%
on T2J Comparison Score; moreover, the generated code runs up to 2.5x faster
than the baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer被广泛使用，但其训练过程不稳定。Layer Normalization作为标准组件能提高训练稳定性，但其放置位置往往缺乏理论依据。

Method: 通过理论分析研究不同Layer Normalization放置位置下的前向稳定性（隐藏状态增长边界）和后向稳定性（梯度反向传播动态），并指导残差连接步长的缩放。

Conclusion: 该框架为检查新架构修改下Transformer的稳定性提供了原则性方法，为未来设计提供指导。

Abstract: Despite their widespread use, training deep Transformers can be unstable.
Layer normalization, a standard component, improves training stability, but its
placement has often been ad-hoc. In this paper, we conduct a principled study
on the forward (hidden states) and backward (gradient) stability of
Transformers under different layer normalization placements. Our theory
provides key insights into the training dynamics: whether training drives
Transformers toward regular solutions or pathological behaviors. For forward
stability, we derive explicit bounds on the growth of hidden states in trained
Transformers. For backward stability, we analyze how layer normalization
affects the backpropagation of gradients, thereby explaining the training
dynamics of each layer normalization placement. Our analysis also guides the
scaling of residual steps in Transformer blocks, where appropriate choices can
further improve stability and performance. Our numerical results corroborate

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative modeling have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in molecular generation, yet the integration of comprehensive
biomedical knowledge into these models has remained an untapped frontier. In
this study, we introduce K-DREAM (Knowledge-Driven Embedding-Augmented Model),
a novel framework that leverages knowledge graphs to augment diffusion-based
generative models for drug discovery. By embedding structured information from
large-scale knowledge graphs, K-DREAM directs molecular generation toward
candidates with higher biological relevance and therapeutic suitability. This
integration ensures that the generated molecules are aligned with specific
therapeutic targets, moving beyond traditional heuristic-driven approaches. In
targeted drug design tasks, K-DREAM generates drug candidates with improved
binding affinities and predicted efficacy, surpassing current state-of-the-art
generative models. It also demonstrates flexibility by producing molecules
designed for multiple targets, enabling applications to complex disease
mechanisms. These results highlight the utility of knowledge-enhanced
generative models in rational drug design and their relevance to practical
therapeutic development.

Abstract: Excess alcohol consumption leads to serious health risks and severe
consequences for both individuals and their communities. To advocate for
healthier drinking habits, we introduce a groundbreaking mobile smartwatch
application approach to just-in-time interventions for intoxication warnings.
In this work, we have created a dataset gathering TAC, accelerometer,

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoGD是一种自动调整学习率的梯度下降方法，无需用户手动调参，能够在不知道平滑常数的情况下恢复GD的最优收敛速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 梯度下降等优化方法的性能严重依赖学习率的选择，手动调整学习率需要大量用户调参工作，特别是在作为其他算法内循环时，期望用户调整学习率是不现实的。

Method: 提出AutoGD方法，自动决定在给定迭代时是增加还是减少学习率，无需知道平滑常数。该方法还可扩展到AutoBFGS和AutoLBFGS。

Result: 实验证明AutoGD在传统问题和变分推断优化任务上表现优异，能够恢复GD的最优收敛速率（最多相差一个常数）。

Conclusion: AutoGD提供了一种自动调整学习率的有效方法，解决了梯度下降方法中学习率调参的难题，特别适用于作为其他算法内循环的场景。

Abstract: The performance of gradient-based optimization methods, such as standard
gradient descent (GD), greatly depends on the choice of learning rate. However,
it can require a non-trivial amount of user tuning effort to select an
appropriate learning rate schedule. When such methods appear as inner loops of
other algorithms, expecting the user to tune the learning rates may be
impractical. To address this, we introduce AutoGD: a gradient descent method
that automatically determines whether to increase or decrease the learning rate
at a given iteration. We establish the convergence of AutoGD, and show that we
can recover the optimal rate of GD (up to a constant) for a broad class of
functions without knowledge of smoothness constants. Experiments on a variety
of traditional problems and variational inference optimization tasks
demonstrate strong performance of the method, along with its extensions to
AutoBFGS and AutoLBFGS.

### [515] [Phase-Aware Deep Learning with Complex-Valued CNNs for Audio Signal Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09926)
*Naman Agrawal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究探索了复值卷积神经网络在音频信号处理中的应用，重点研究如何保留和利用实值网络中常被忽略的相位信息。通过理论框架构建和三个阶段的实证评估，证明了复值架构的表达能力和相位信息在音频处理中的价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统实值神经网络在处理音频信号时往往忽略相位信息，而相位在音频处理中具有重要价值。本研究旨在探索复值卷积神经网络如何更好地保留和利用相位信息，提升音频信号处理性能。

Method: 构建复值卷积神经网络的理论框架，包括复卷积、池化层、Wirtinger微分和各种复值激活函数。采用复批量归一化和权重初始化方案确保训练稳定性。通过三个阶段进行实证评估：图像数据集基准测试、基于MFCC的音频分类、以及引入图神经网络建模相位信息。

Result: 在图像数据集上，CVCNNs表现出与实值CNN相当的竞争力；在音频分类中，基于实值MFCC的CVCNNs略优于实值CNN；通过GNN建模相位信息在二元和多类流派分类中均取得了可衡量的性能提升。

Conclusion: 复值架构具有强大的表达能力，相位是音频处理中有意义且可利用的特征。虽然当前方法（特别是cardioid激活函数）显示出潜力，但未来需要进一步发展相位感知设计来充分发挥复值表示在神经网络中的潜力。

Abstract: This study explores the design and application of Complex-Valued
Convolutional Neural Networks (CVCNNs) in audio signal processing, with a focus
on preserving and utilizing phase information often neglected in real-valued
networks. We begin by presenting the foundational theoretical concepts of
CVCNNs, including complex convolutions, pooling layers, Wirtinger-based
differentiation, and various complex-valued activation functions. These are
complemented by critical adaptations of training techniques, including complex
batch normalization and weight initialization schemes, to ensure stability in
training dynamics. Empirical evaluations are conducted across three stages.
First, CVCNNs are benchmarked on standard image datasets, where they
demonstrate competitive performance with real-valued CNNs, even under synthetic
complex perturbations. Although our focus is audio signal processing, we first
evaluate CVCNNs on image datasets to establish baseline performance and
validate training stability before applying them to audio tasks. In the second
experiment, we focus on audio classification using Mel-Frequency Cepstral
Coefficients (MFCCs). CVCNNs trained on real-valued MFCCs slightly outperform
real CNNs, while preserving phase in input workflows highlights challenges in
exploiting phase without architectural modifications. Finally, a third
experiment introduces GNNs to model phase information via edge weighting, where
the inclusion of phase yields measurable gains in both binary and multi-class
genre classification. These results underscore the expressive capacity of
complex-valued architectures and confirm phase as a meaningful and exploitable
feature in audio processing applications. While current methods show promise,
especially with activations like cardioid, future advances in phase-aware
design will be essential to leverage the potential of complex representations
in neural networks.

*Ching Chang,Ming-Chih Lo,Chiao-Tung Chan,Wen-Chih Peng,Tien-Fu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MemPromptTSS是一个用于多粒度时间序列分割的框架，通过引入持久提示记忆来解决现有方法中提示影响快速消失的问题，在单次和迭代推理中都显著提升了分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列分割的提示方法只在局部上下文操作，提示的影响会快速消失，无法在整个序列中指导预测。需要一种能够使提示影响持久化的方法。

Method: 提出MemPromptTSS框架，通过记忆编码器将提示及其周围子序列转换为记忆令牌存储在记忆库中，使每个新预测不仅基于局部线索，还能基于所有累积的提示。

Result: 在6个数据集上的实验显示，MemPromptTSS在单次推理的单粒度和多粒度分割中分别比最佳基线提升23%和85%的准确率，在迭代推理中平均每轮增益2.66个百分点，优于PromptTSS的1.19。

Conclusion: 持久记忆对于提示引导的分割至关重要，MemPromptTSS为实际应用提供了一个实用有效的框架。

Abstract: Web platforms, mobile applications, and connected sensing systems generate
multivariate time series with states at multiple levels of granularity, from
coarse regimes to fine-grained events. Effective segmentation in these settings
requires integrating across granularities while supporting iterative refinement
through sparse prompt signals, which provide a compact mechanism for injecting
domain knowledge. Yet existing prompting approaches for time series
segmentation operate only within local contexts, so the effect of a prompt
quickly fades and cannot guide predictions across the entire sequence. To
overcome this limitation, we propose MemPromptTSS, a framework for iterative
multi-granularity segmentation that introduces persistent prompt memory. A
memory encoder transforms prompts and their surrounding subsequences into
memory tokens stored in a bank. This persistent memory enables each new
prediction to condition not only on local cues but also on all prompts
accumulated across iterations, ensuring their influence persists across the
entire sequence. Experiments on six datasets covering wearable sensing and
industrial monitoring show that MemPromptTSS achieves 23% and 85% accuracy
improvements over the best baseline in single- and multi-granularity
segmentation under single iteration inference, and provides stronger refinement
in iterative inference with average per-iteration gains of 2.66 percentage
points compared to 1.19 for PromptTSS. These results highlight the importance
of persistent memory for prompt-guided segmentation, establishing MemPromptTSS
as a practical and effective framework for real-world applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SQS-SD框架，通过结构化稀疏化和基于格点的量化来压缩边缘SLM生成的草稿token分布，以解决边缘-云推理中的带宽限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘-云推测解码中，边缘-云链路的有限带宽是主要瓶颈，需要高效压缩草稿token分布。

Method: 提出SQS-SD框架，利用分布稀疏性进行结构化稀疏化和格点量化。K-SQS使用固定top-K截断，C-SQS通过在线符合预测自适应调整保留token集。

Result: 两种方法在互补的操作机制下都能改善端到端延迟和拒绝率。

Conclusion: 信息论分析指导的SQS-SD框架有效解决了边缘-云推测解码中的带宽限制问题。

Abstract: Edge-cloud speculative decoding (SD) accelerates inference by having a
cloud-based large language model (LLM) that verifies draft tokens generated by
a resource-constrained small language model (SLM) at the edge. A central
bottleneck is the limited bandwidth of the edge-cloud link, which necessitates
efficient compression of draft token distributions. We first derive an
information-theoretic bound that decomposes the token rejection rate into
contributions from SLM-LLM distribution mismatch and from quantization
distortion. Guided by this analysis, we propose the Sparse Quantize-and-Sample
SD (SQS-SD) framework, which exploits distributional sparsity through
structured sparsification and lattice-based quantization. Within this
framework, K-SQS applies fixed top-K truncation, while C-SQS adaptively adjusts
the retained token set via online conformal prediction to ensure bounded
deviation from the dense distribution. Empirical results confirm that both
approaches improve end-to-end latency and rejection rates in complimentary
operating regimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统不完全多视图谱聚类需要在特征提取后使用K-means生成聚类结果，且未有效利用样本连通性。

Method: 通过非负约束直接提取聚类结果，基于谱聚类结果构建连通性矩阵，并最小化基于连通性矩阵的自表示残差。

Result: 在基准数据集上，CRG_IMSC优于现有最先进的聚类方法，并证明了算法的收敛性。

Conclusion: CRG_IMSC有效解决了不完全多视图谱聚类的缺陷，实现了更好的聚类性能。

Abstract: Incomplete multi-view spectral clustering generalizes spectral clustering to
multi-view data and simultaneously realizes the partition of multi-view data
with missing views. For this category of method, K-means algorithm needs to be
performed to generate the clustering result after the procedure of feature
extraction. More importantly, the connectivity of samples reflected by the
clustering result is not utilized effectively. To overcome these defects, we
propose Clustering Result re-Guided Incomplete Multi-view Spectral Clustering
(CRG_IMSC). CRG_IMSC obtains the clustering result directly by imposing
nonnegative constraint to the extracted feature. Furthermore, it constructs the
connectivity matrix according to the result of spectral clustering, and
minimizes the residual of self-representation based on the connectivity matrix.
A novel iterative algorithm using multiplicative update is developed to solve
the optimization problem of CRG_IMSC, and its convergence is proved rigorously.
On benchmark datasets, for multi-view data, CRG_IMSC performs better than
state-of-the-art clustering methods, and the experimental results also
demonstrate the convergence of CRG_IMSC algorithm.

Method: 基于同态概念构建抽象框架，定义马尔可夫链同态为价值函数呈线性关系。提出同态策略梯度算法及其误差有界扩展版本，平衡计算效率与聚合引起的性能损失。

Result: 建立了最优策略等价的充分条件，推导了近似误差上界和性能下界。实验验证了理论结果，并与七种算法进行了比较评估。

Conclusion: 所提出的同态框架为状态聚合提供了理论基础，HPG和EBHPG算法在保证最优策略等价或控制性能损失的同时，有效降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: State aggregation aims to reduce the computational complexity of solving
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) while preserving the performance of the
original system. A fundamental challenge lies in optimizing policies within the
aggregated, or abstract, space such that the performance remains optimal in the
ground MDP-a property referred to as {"}optimal policy equivalence {"}.
  This paper presents an abstraction framework based on the notion of
homomorphism, in which two Markov chains are deemed homomorphic if their value
functions exhibit a linear relationship. Within this theoretical framework, we
establish a sufficient condition for the equivalence of optimal policy.
  We further examine scenarios where the sufficient condition is not met and
derive an upper bound on the approximation error and a performance lower bound
for the objective function under the ground MDP. We propose Homomorphic Policy
Gradient (HPG), which guarantees optimal policy equivalence under sufficient
conditions, and its extension, Error-Bounded HPG (EBHPG), which balances
computational efficiency and the performance loss induced by aggregation. In
the experiments, we validated the theoretical results and conducted comparative
evaluations against seven algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型性能受限于监督数据的质量和覆盖范围，而传统强化学习方法在流匹配模型中由于重要性采样过程难以计算而不可行。

Method: FPO通过重新定义重要性采样，利用条件流匹配目标的逐样本变化，结合结构感知信用分配、裁剪代理目标、多步潜在探索和Q集成机制。

Result: 在LIBERO基准和ALOHA模拟任务中，FPO相比监督学习、偏好对齐、扩散基线和自回归在线RL等方法表现出持续改进，在稀疏奖励下实现稳定学习。

Conclusion: FPO算法有效解决了流匹配模型在线强化学习的计算挑战，通过提出的计算模块实现了稳定收敛和性能提升。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models such as OpenVLA, Octo, and $\pi_0$ have
shown strong generalization by leveraging large-scale demonstrations, yet their
performance is still fundamentally constrained by the quality and coverage of
supervised data. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a promising path for
improving and fine-tuning VLAs through online interaction. However,
conventional policy gradient methods are computationally infeasible in the
context of flow-matching based models due to the intractability of the
importance sampling process, which requires explicit computation of policy
ratios. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow Policy Optimization (FPO)
algorithm, which reformulates importance sampling by leveraging per-sample
changes in the conditional flow-matching objective. Furthermore, FPO achieves
stable and scalable online reinforcement fine-tuning of the $\pi_0$ model by
integrating structure-aware credit assignment to enhance gradient efficiency,
clipped surrogate objectives to stabilize optimization, multi-step latent
exploration to encourage diverse policy updates, and a Q-ensemble mechanism to
provide robust value estimation. We evaluate FPO on the LIBERO benchmark and
the ALOHA simulation task against supervised, preference-aligned,
diffusion-based, autoregressive online RL, and $\pi_0$-FAST baselines,
observing consistent improvements over the imitation prior and strong
alternatives with stable learning under sparse rewards. In addition, ablation
studies and analyses of the latent space dynamics further highlight the
contributions of individual components within FPO, validating the effectiveness
of the proposed computational modules and the stable convergence of the
conditional flow-matching objective during online RL.

Result: 在真实世界传感器数据上的实验证明了所提方法的有效性

Conclusion: 该方法能够精确识别增材制造中缺陷异常的起始点，解决了现有方法的局限性

Abstract: Online sensing plays an important role in advancing modern manufacturing. The
real-time sensor signals, which can be stored as high-resolution time series
data, contain rich information about the operation status. One of its popular
usages is online process monitoring, which can be achieved by effective anomaly
detection from the sensor signals. However, most existing approaches either
heavily rely on labeled data for training supervised models, or are designed to
detect only extreme outliers, thus are ineffective at identifying subtle
semantic off-track anomalies to capture where new regimes or unexpected
routines start. To address this challenge, we propose an matrix profile-based
unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm that captures fabrication cycle
similarity and performs semantic segmentation to precisely identify the onset
of defect anomalies in additive manufacturing. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is demonstrated by the experiments on real-world sensor data.

Motivation: 现有研究大多只关注单一类型的软件图表示，而函数调用图和进程交互图的联合建模尚未充分探索，这为软件系统的多视角分析提供了机会。

Method: 构建了包含635个Windows可执行文件的数据集，使用Ghidra提取函数调用图，Any.Run沙箱提取进程调用图。提出GeminiNet神经网络，采用双图卷积分支和自适应门控机制来平衡静态和动态视图的贡献。

Result: 实验证明联合嵌入方法优于单图模型，在恶意软件检测任务中表现更好。

Conclusion: 通过联合建模函数调用图和进程调用图，GeminiNet能够从多视角分析软件系统，提供更全面的软件行为理解。

Abstract: Software systems can be represented as graphs, capturing dependencies among
functions and processes. An interesting aspect of software systems is that they
can be represented as different types of graphs, depending on the extraction
goals and priorities. For example, function calls within the software can be
captured to create function call graphs, which highlight the relationships
between functions and their dependencies. Alternatively, the processes spawned
by the software can be modeled to generate process interaction graphs, which
focus on runtime behavior and inter-process communication. While these graph
representations are related, each captures a distinct perspective of the
system, providing complementary insights into its structure and operation.
While previous studies have leveraged graph neural networks (GNNs) to analyze
software behaviors, most of this work has focused on a single type of graph
representation. The joint modeling of both function call graphs and process
interaction graphs remains largely underexplored, leaving opportunities for
deeper, multi-perspective analysis of software systems. This paper presents a
pipeline for constructing and training Function Call Graphs (FCGs) and Process
Call Graphs (PCGs) and learning joint embeddings. We demonstrate that joint
embeddings outperform a single-graph model. In this paper, we propose
GeminiNet, a unified neural network approach that learns joint embeddings from
both FCGs and PCGs. We construct a new dataset of 635 Windows executables (318
malicious and 317 benign), extracting FCGs via Ghidra and PCGs via Any.Run
sandbox. GeminiNet employs dual graph convolutional branches with an adaptive
gating mechanism that balances contributions from static and dynamic views.

Result: 在广泛评估中，该方法在保持竞争性鲁棒精度的同时，提供了比现有方法更紧的证书

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在WDRO问题中实现了更紧的上界和更灵活的攻击能力，为对抗鲁棒性提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (WDRO) provides a framework
for adversarial robustness, yet existing methods based on global Lipschitz
continuity or strong duality often yield loose upper bounds or require
prohibitive computation. In this work, we address these limitations by
introducing a primal approach and adopting a notion of exact Lipschitz
certificate to tighten this upper bound of WDRO. In addition, we propose a
novel Wasserstein distributional attack (WDA) that directly constructs a
candidate for the worst-case distribution. Compared to existing point-wise
attack and its variants, our WDA offers greater flexibility in the number and
location of attack points. In particular, by leveraging the piecewise-affine
structure of ReLU networks on their activation cells, our approach results in
an exact tractable characterization of the corresponding WDRO problem.
Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves competitive robust
accuracy against state-of-the-art baselines while offering tighter certificates
than existing methods. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有EEG识别模型由于数据集特定约束和个体变异性，导致跨范式泛化能力差，需要开发能够适应不同范式的统一架构。

Method: 采用对齐的时频流保持时间同步，使用金字塔时频注意力进行多尺度特征增强，以及双向时间卷积网络捕获前向/后向神经动态。

Conclusion: 验证了范式对齐的频谱-时间处理对于可靠脑机接口系统的重要性，BITE作为一个统一架构在MI和SSVEP任务中均表现出色且计算效率高。

Abstract: Existing EEG recognition models suffer from poor cross-paradigm
generalization due to dataset-specific constraints and individual variability.
To overcome these limitations, we propose BITE (Bidirectional Time-Freq Pyramid
Network), an end-to-end unified architecture featuring robust multistream
synergy, pyramid time-frequency attention (PTFA), and bidirectional adaptive
convolutions. The framework uniquely integrates: 1) Aligned time-frequency
streams maintaining temporal synchronization with STFT for bidirectional
modeling, 2) PTFA-based multi-scale feature enhancement amplifying critical
neural patterns, 3) BiTCN with learnable fusion capturing forward/backward
neural dynamics. Demonstrating enhanced robustness, BITE achieves
state-of-the-art performance across four divergent paradigms (BCICIV-2A/2B,
HGD, SD-SSVEP), excelling in both within-subject accuracy and cross-subject
generalization. As a unified architecture, it combines robust performance
across both MI and SSVEP tasks with exceptional computational efficiency. Our
work validates that paradigm-aligned spectral-temporal processing is essential
for reliable BCI systems. Just as its name suggests, BITE "takes a bite out of

Conclusion: 基于技能的自适应训练应广泛改进当前训练流程。

Abstract: Language models often show little to no improvement (i.e., "saturation") when
trained via vanilla supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on data similar to what they
saw in their training set (e.g., MATH). We introduce a new fine-tuning
strategy, STAT, to train such a student model by using the metacognition
ability of a stronger large language model (LLM) as the teacher. The teacher
uses the task dataset to create a list of skills needed for the task, and then
labels each data point with its required skills (Didolkar et al., 2024). By
monitoring the student's answers, the teacher creates a Missing-Skill-Profile
for the student, tracking how often they failed to apply each skill in their
responses. We use this idea to build a modified training set in one of two
ways. In STAT-Sel, the teacher uses an existing set of training examples but
adaptively reweights them according to the Missing-Skill-Profile. In STAT-Syn,
the teacher synthesizes additional examples involving missing skills. Across
extensive experiments on Llama and Qwen models, our methods yield improvements
of up to 7.5% on MATH, whereas SFT provides only limited gains. Furthermore,
STAT enhances performance on out-of-distribution benchmarks (e.g., AIME24/25,
AMC23, etc.) by an average of 4.6%. Crucially, we find that STAT is
complementary to RL via GRPO (Shao et al., 2024): after the model is improved
using STAT to address skill gaps, GRPO continues to add further gains. We
conclude that skill-targeted adaptive training should broadly improve current
training pipelines. Our code is available at:

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Low-Altitude Economy Networks (LAENets) has enabled
a variety of applications, including aerial surveillance, environmental
sensing, and semantic data collection. To support these scenarios, unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with onboard vision-language models (VLMs)
offer a promising solution for real-time multimodal inference. However,
ensuring both inference accuracy and communication efficiency remains a
significant challenge due to limited onboard resources and dynamic network
conditions. In this paper, we first propose a UAV-enabled LAENet system model
that jointly captures UAV mobility, user-UAV communication, and the onboard
visual question answering (VQA) pipeline. Based on this model, we formulate a
mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem to minimize task latency and
power consumption under user-specific accuracy constraints. To solve the
problem, we design a hierarchical optimization framework composed of two parts:
(i) an Alternating Resolution and Power Optimization (ARPO) algorithm for
resource allocation under accuracy constraints, and (ii) a Large Language
Model-augmented Reinforcement Learning Approach (LLaRA) for adaptive UAV
trajectory optimization. The large language model (LLM) serves as an expert in
refining reward design of reinforcement learning in an offline fashion,
introducing no additional latency in real-time decision-making. Numerical
results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework in improving
inference performance and communication efficiency under dynamic LAENet
conditions.

TL;DR: PPOPT是一种新颖的无模型深度强化学习算法，通过预训练在物理环境中实现高训练效率和稳定性，特别适合小样本训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习需要大量环境交互，计算成本高。PPOPT旨在通过预训练减少交互需求，提高训练效率。

Method: 采用包含预训练神经网络中间层的新策略网络架构，在具有相似物理特性的环境中预训练，然后迁移到目标环境。

Result: PPOPT在小样本训练中优于经典PPO，奖励更高且训练更稳定；虽然不如DYNA DDPG等基于模型的方法，但训练时间显著更短。

Conclusion: PPOPT提供了一种高效的模型无关强化学习方法，特别适合计算资源有限的小样本场景，已开源实现。

Abstract: We introduce PPOPT - Proximal Policy Optimization using Pretraining, a novel,
model-free deep-reinforcement-learning algorithm that leverages pretraining to
achieve high training efficiency and stability on very small training samples
in physics-based environments. Reinforcement learning agents typically rely on
large samples of environment interactions to learn a policy. However, frequent
interactions with a (computer-simulated) environment may incur high
computational costs, especially when the environment is complex. Our main
innovation is a new policy neural network architecture that consists of a
pretrained neural network middle section sandwiched between two fully-connected
networks. Pretraining part of the network on a different environment with
similar physics will help the agent learn the target environment with high
efficiency because it will leverage a general understanding of the
transferrable physics characteristics from the pretraining environment. We
demonstrate that PPOPT outperforms baseline classic PPO on small training
samples both in terms of rewards gained and general training stability. While
PPOPT underperforms against classic model-based methods such as DYNA DDPG, the
model-free nature of PPOPT allows it to train in significantly less time than
its model-based counterparts. Finally, we present our implementation of PPOPT
as open-source software, available at github.com/Davidrxyang/PPOPT.

Method: 使用基于softmax的不确定性作为样本难度的连续度量，构建四阶段课程（简单-非常困难），将FOSSIL集成到卷积和基于transformer的架构中

Result: 在所有设置下，FOSSIL显著改善了区分能力（AUC=0.9573）、校准（ECE=0.053）和真实世界扰动下的鲁棒性，优于传统基线方法

Conclusion: FOSSIL是一个可泛化、数据高效且可解释的框架，适用于医学影像中数据稀缺情况下的难度感知学习

Abstract: Deep learning in small and imbalanced biomedical datasets remains
fundamentally constrained by unstable optimization and poor generalization. We
present the first biomedical implementation of FOSSIL (Flexible Optimization
via Sample-Sensitive Importance Learning), a regret-minimizing weighting
framework that adaptively balances training emphasis according to sample
difficulty. Using softmax-based uncertainty as a continuous measure of
difficulty, we construct a four-stage curriculum (Easy-Very Hard) and integrate
FOSSIL into both convolutional and transformer-based architectures for Mpox
skin lesion diagnosis. Across all settings, FOSSIL substantially improves
discrimination (AUC = 0.9573), calibration (ECE = 0.053), and robustness under
real-world perturbations, outperforming conventional baselines without
metadata, manual curation, or synthetic augmentation. The results position
FOSSIL as a generalizable, data-efficient, and interpretable framework for
difficulty-aware learning in medical imaging under data scarcity.

<details>

Motivation: 现有学习方法忽略实际稳定性约束，在不同箱子尺寸间泛化能力有限。

Method: 使用加权奖励函数结合装载率和高度差指标，采用剪裁策略梯度优化和策略漂移方法防止策略熵崩溃。

Result: O4M-SP在不同箱子尺寸上成功泛化，显著优于基线方法，并有效处理稳定性约束场景。

Conclusion: O4M-SP在3D装箱问题中表现出优秀的泛化能力和实际适用性，能有效处理稳定性约束。

Abstract: The three-dimensional bin packing problem (3D-BPP) is widely applied in
logistics and warehousing. Existing learning-based approaches often neglect
practical stability-related constraints and exhibit limitations in generalizing
across diverse bin dimensions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
deep reinforcement learning framework, One4Many-StablePacker (O4M-SP). The
primary advantage of O4M-SP is its ability to handle various bin dimensions in
a single training process while incorporating support and weight constraints
common in practice. Our training method introduces two innovative mechanisms.
First, it employs a weighted reward function that integrates loading rate and a
new height difference metric for packing layouts, promoting improved bin
utilization through flatter packing configurations. Second, it combines clipped
policy gradient optimization with a tailored policy drifting method to mitigate
policy entropy collapse, encouraging exploration at critical decision nodes
during packing to avoid suboptimal solutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that O4M-SP generalizes successfully across diverse bin dimensions and
significantly outperforms baseline methods. Furthermore, O4M-SP exhibits strong
practical applicability by effectively addressing packing scenarios with
stability constraints.

Motivation: 自注意力能自适应识别相关元素但依赖绝对位置嵌入，卷积能相对编码但固定核大小限制了自适应选择能力，需要统一两者的优势。

Method: 提出Translution操作，结合自注意力的自适应识别和卷积的相对编码，并设计轻量级α-Translution变体以解决参数过多问题。

Result: 在计算机视觉和自然语言处理任务上的实验表明，Translution（包括α-Translution）相比自注意力实现了更高的准确率。

Conclusion: Translution成功统一了自注意力和卷积的优势，在保持高性能的同时提供了更有效的结构表示学习方案。

Abstract: When modeling a given type of data, we consider it to involve two key
aspects: 1) identifying relevant elements (e.g., image pixels or textual words)
to a central element, as in a convolutional receptive field, or to a query
element, as in self-attention, and 2) encoding these tokens effectively.
Self-attention can adaptively identify these elements but relies on absolute
positional embedding for structural representation learning. In contrast,
convolution encodes elements in a relative manner, yet their fixed kernel size
limits their ability to adaptively select the relevant elements. In this paper,
we introduce Translution, an operation that unifies the adaptive identification
capability of self-attention and the relative encoding advantage of
convolution. However, this integration leads to a substantial increase in the
number of parameters, exceeding most currently available computational
resources. Therefore, we propose a lightweight variant of Translution, named
{\alpha}-Translution. Experiments on computer vision and natural language
processing tasks show that Translution (including {\alpha}-Translution)
achieves superior accuracy compared to self-attention. The code is available at

TL;DR: ADEPT是一个用于持续预训练的自适应扩展和解耦调优框架，通过选择性层扩展和自适应单元解耦调优，在数学和医学基准测试中优于全参数CPT，仅需15%参数和不到50%训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的持续预训练存在灾难性遗忘和有限领域容量问题，现有层扩展方法仍然纠缠通用和领域学习，效果有限。研究发现LLMs具有功能专门化特性，表明参数扩展和优化应该是功能感知的。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 通用能力引导的选择性层扩展，复制对通用领域最不关键的层；2) 自适应单元解耦调优，根据通用领域重要性解耦参数单元，分配非对称学习率来平衡知识注入和保留。

Result: 在数学和医学基准测试中，ADEPT比全参数CPT在通用领域性能提升高达5.76%，在目标领域提升5.58%，仅需调整15%参数和不到50%训练时间。

Conclusion: 消融研究、理论分析和扩展调查证明了针对性扩展和解耦优化的必要性，为高效鲁棒的领域自适应持续预训练提供了新原则。

Abstract: Conventional continual pretraining (CPT) for large language model (LLM)
domain adaptation often suffers from catastrophic forgetting and limited domain
capacity. Existing strategies adopt layer expansion, introducing additional
trainable parameters to accommodate new knowledge. However, the uniform
expansion and updates still entangle general and domain learning, undermining
its effectiveness. Our pilot studies reveal that LLMs exhibit functional
specialization, where layers and units differentially encode general-critical
capabilities, suggesting that parameter expansion and optimization should be
function-aware. We then propose ADEPT, Adaptive Expansion and Dynamic Decoupled
Tuning for continual pretraining, a two-stage framework for domain-adaptive
CPT. ADEPT first performs General-Competence Guided Selective Layer Expansion,
duplicating layers least critical for the general domain to increase
representational capacity while minimizing interference with general knowledge.
It then applies Adaptive Unit-Wise Decoupled Tuning, disentangling parameter
units within expanded layers according to their general-domain importance and
assigning asymmetric learning rates to balance knowledge injection and
retention. Experiments on mathematical and medical benchmarks show that ADEPT
outperforms full-parameter CPT by up to 5.76% on the general domain and 5.58%
on the target domain with only 15% of parameters tuned and less than 50%
training time. Ablation studies, theoretical analysis, and extended
investigations further demonstrate the necessity of targeted expansion and
decoupled optimization, providing new principles for efficient and robust
domain-adaptive CPT. Our code is open-sourced at

Motivation: 深度学习模型在时间序列分类中表现出色，但可能依赖训练数据中的虚假相关性，这种捷径行为在时间序列领域尚未充分探索。现有研究多关注外部属性而非内部偏差行为。

Conclusion: 该研究首次确立并检测了深度学习时间序列分类中的基于点捷径学习行为。

Abstract: Deep learning models have attracted lots of research attention in time series
classification (TSC) task in the past two decades. Recently, deep neural
networks (DNN) have surpassed classical distance-based methods and achieved
state-of-the-art performance. Despite their promising performance, deep neural
networks (DNNs) have been shown to rely on spurious correlations present in the
training data, which can hinder generalization. For instance, a model might
incorrectly associate the presence of grass with the label ``cat" if the
training set have majority of cats lying in grassy backgrounds. However, the
shortcut behavior of DNNs in time series remain under-explored. Most existing
shortcut work are relying on external attributes such as gender, patients
group, instead of focus on the internal bias behavior in time series models.
  In this paper, we take the first step to investigate and establish
point-based shortcut learning behavior in deep learning time series
classification. We further propose a simple detection method based on other
class to detect shortcut occurs without relying on test data or clean training
classes. We test our proposed method in UCR time series datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 循环注意力变换器在复杂推理任务中表现优于标准变换器，但其理论优势尚未得到充分探索，需要从损失景观几何角度解释这一现象。

Method: 扩展River-Valley景观模型，区分U形谷和V形谷，提出循环注意力架构诱导River-V-Valley景观偏置，并基于此设计SHIFT分层渐进训练框架。

Result: 理论推导证明循环注意力在河谷跳跃中具有更好的损失收敛性，并能学习更复杂的模式，SHIFT框架能加速训练同时保持可比性能。

Conclusion: 循环注意力变换器通过诱导V形河谷景观偏置获得理论优势，SHIFT框架有效加速其训练过程。

Abstract: While looped transformers (termed as Looped-Attn) often outperform standard
transformers (termed as Single-Attn) on complex reasoning tasks, the
theoretical basis for this advantage remains underexplored. In this paper, we
explain this phenomenon through the lens of loss landscape geometry, inspired
by empirical observations of their distinct dynamics at both sample and Hessian
levels. To formalize this, we extend the River-Valley landscape model by
distinguishing between U-shaped valleys (flat) and V-shaped valleys (steep).
Based on empirical observations, we conjecture that the recursive architecture
of Looped-Attn induces a landscape-level inductive bias towards River-V-Valley.
Theoretical derivations based on this inductive bias guarantee a better loss
convergence along the river due to valley hopping, and further encourage
learning about complex patterns compared to the River-U-Valley induced by
Single-Attn. Building on this insight, we propose SHIFT (Staged HIerarchical
Framework for Progressive Training), a staged training framework that
accelerates the training process of Looped-Attn while achieving comparable
performances.

TL;DR: 该论文通过着色算法理论解释了图神经网络表达力与泛化能力之间的权衡关系，证明了更强的表达能力会导致更高的Rademacher复杂度，从而削弱泛化保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释图神经网络中观察到的现象：表达能力更强的GNN虽然能区分更多图结构，但泛化误差也更高，需要理论解释这种权衡关系。

Method: 通过WL着色算法建立联系，分析着色诱导的等价类数量与Rademacher复杂度的关系，证明表达能力与泛化能力之间的理论联系。

Result: 证明了WL着色等价类数量直接约束GNN的Rademacher复杂度，表达能力增强导致复杂度增加，泛化保证减弱。同时证明复杂度对颜色计数的扰动具有稳定性。

Conclusion: 该框架统一了GNN表达力和泛化能力的研究，为理解表达能力增强往往以泛化能力为代价提供了理论依据，且适用于任意GNN架构和表达能力度量。

Abstract: The expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) is typically understood
through their correspondence with graph isomorphism tests such as the
Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy. While more expressive GNNs can distinguish a
richer set of graphs, they are also observed to suffer from higher
generalization error. This work provides a theoretical explanation for this
trade-off by linking expressivity and generalization through the lens of
coloring algorithms. Specifically, we show that the number of equivalence
classes induced by WL colorings directly bounds the GNNs Rademacher complexity
-- a key data-dependent measure of generalization. Our analysis reveals that
greater expressivity leads to higher complexity and thus weaker generalization
guarantees. Furthermore, we prove that the Rademacher complexity is stable
under perturbations in the color counts across different samples, ensuring
robustness to sampling variability across datasets. Importantly, our framework
is not restricted to message-passing GNNs or 1-WL, but extends to arbitrary GNN
architectures and expressivity measures that partition graphs into equivalence
classes. These results unify the study of expressivity and generalization in
GNNs, providing a principled understanding of why increasing expressive power
often comes at the cost of generalization.

TL;DR: PANTHER是一个混合生成-判别框架，将生成式预训练扩展到用户行为建模，通过结构化标记化、序列模式识别、统一用户画像嵌入和实时推理优化，在微信支付中显著提升了交易预测和欺诈检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然能封装广泛的世界知识，但在建模用户交互历史中的行为知识方面存在局限。用户行为形成独特模态，每个动作包含时间、上下文等多维属性，现有判别模型在有限监督下难以有效建模这些高基数序列。

Method: 提出PANTHER框架：1）结构化标记化将多维交易属性压缩为可解释词汇；2）序列模式识别模块建模周期性交易模式；3）统一用户画像嵌入融合静态人口统计和动态交易历史；4）通过离线缓存预训练嵌入实现毫秒级实时推理。

Result: 在微信支付中完全部署运行，相比基线方法：下一交易预测HitRate@1提升25.6%，欺诈检测召回率相对提升38.6%。在公共基准上的跨域评估显示强泛化能力，比transformer基线最高获得21%的HitRate@1提升。

Conclusion: PANTHER被确立为一个可扩展、高性能的工业级序列用户行为建模框架，证明了生成式预训练在用户行为建模中的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown that generative pretraining can
distill vast world knowledge into compact token representations. While LLMs
encapsulate extensive world knowledge, they remain limited in modeling the
behavioral knowledge contained within user interaction histories. User behavior
forms a distinct modality, where each action, defined by multi-dimensional
attributes such as time, context, and transaction type, constitutes a
behavioral token. Modeling these high-cardinality sequences is challenging, and
discriminative models often falter under limited supervision. To bridge this
gap, we extend generative pretraining to user behavior, learning transferable
representations from unlabeled behavioral data analogous to how LLMs learn from
text. We present PANTHER, a hybrid generative-discriminative framework that
unifies user behavior pretraining and downstream adaptation, enabling
large-scale sequential user representation learning and real-time inference.
PANTHER introduces: (1) Structured Tokenization to compress multi-dimensional
transaction attributes into an interpretable vocabulary; (2) Sequence Pattern
Recognition Module (SPRM) for modeling periodic transaction motifs; (3) a
Unified User-Profile Embedding that fuses static demographics with dynamic
transaction histories; and (4) Real-time scalability enabled by offline caching
of pretrained embeddings for millisecond-level inference. Fully deployed and
operational online at WeChat Pay, PANTHER delivers a 25.6 percent boost in
next-transaction prediction HitRate@1 and a 38.6 percent relative improvement
in fraud detection recall over baselines. Cross-domain evaluations on public
benchmarks show strong generalization, achieving up to 21 percent HitRate@1
gains over transformer baselines, establishing PANTHER as a scalable,
high-performance framework for industrial sequential user behavior modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图的推荐系统（如LightGCN）需要为每个节点维护d维嵌入，参数复杂度为O(n×d)，在大规模图上部署面临挑战。

Method: 分析原始参数结构和冗余性，提出稀疏邻接结构和高维嵌入矩阵的高效压缩方案，采用解耦框架优化训练过程。

Result: 在大规模交互图上，仅使用LightGCN 1%的参数就能达到相当甚至更好的性能。

Conclusion: Lighter-X显著减少了参数规模和计算复杂度，同时保持了基础模型的理论保证和实证性能，实现了大规模实际部署。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in
recommendation systems. However, conventional graph-based recommenders, such as
LightGCN, require maintaining embeddings of size $d$ for each node, resulting
in a parameter complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n \times d)$, where $n$ represents
the total number of users and items. This scaling pattern poses significant
challenges for deployment on large-scale graphs encountered in real-world
applications. To address this scalability limitation, we propose
\textbf{Lighter-X}, an efficient and modular framework that can be seamlessly
integrated with existing GNN-based recommender architectures. Our approach
substantially reduces both parameter size and computational complexity while
preserving the theoretical guarantees and empirical performance of the base
models, thereby enabling practical deployment at scale. Specifically, we
analyze the original structure and inherent redundancy in their parameters,
identifying opportunities for optimization. Based on this insight, we propose
an efficient compression scheme for the sparse adjacency structure and
high-dimensional embedding matrices, achieving a parameter complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(h \times d)$, where $h \ll n$. Furthermore, the model is optimized
through a decoupled framework, reducing computational complexity during the
training process and enhancing scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that Lighter-X achieves comparable performance to baseline models with
significantly fewer parameters. In particular, on large-scale interaction
graphs with millions of edges, we are able to attain even better results with
only 1\% of the parameter over LightGCN.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs依赖人工标注标签且难以处理复杂多样的局部拓扑，LLMs在少样本学习上表现良好但面临可扩展性挑战

Method: 开发GNN偏好驱动的节点选择器和节点偏好驱动的GNN选择器，实现从LLMs到教师GNNs再到学生GNN的知识蒸馏

Result: 在真实世界TAGs上的大量实验验证了该框架在少样本节点分类中的有效性

Conclusion: 该框架成功融合了LLMs和GNNs的互补优势，解决了少样本节点分类的挑战

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) can efficiently process text-attributed graphs
(TAGs) due to their message-passing mechanisms, but their training heavily
relies on the human-annotated labels. Moreover, the complex and diverse local
topologies of nodes of real-world TAGs make it challenging for a single
mechanism to handle. Large language models (LLMs) perform well in
zero-/few-shot learning on TAGs but suffer from a scalability challenge.
Therefore, we propose a preference-driven knowledge distillation (PKD)
framework to synergize the complementary strengths of LLMs and various GNNs for
few-shot node classification. Specifically, we develop a GNN-preference-driven
node selector that effectively promotes prediction distillation from LLMs to
teacher GNNs. To further tackle nodes' intricate local topologies, we develop a
node-preference-driven GNN selector that identifies the most suitable teacher
GNN for each node, thereby facilitating tailored knowledge distillation from
teacher GNNs to the student GNN. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of
our proposed framework in few-shot node classification on real-world TAGs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CacheClip是一个解决RAG系统中TTFT瓶颈的新框架，通过辅助LLM指导的token选择和KV缓存重用技术，在保持高质量的同时显著加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的KV缓存重用方法在RAG场景中存在基本权衡：前缀缓存需要相同前缀但RAG中很少出现，直接预计算因缺少跨块注意力和重复注意力sink而牺牲质量。

Method: CacheClip集成三种技术：1)辅助模型指导的token选择用于选择性KV缓存重计算；2)共享前缀消除冗余注意力sink；3)分组策略在部分KV缓存更新时保持局部连贯性。

Result: 实验显示CacheClip在NIAH和LongBench上分别保持94.8%和85.0%的全注意力性能，比APE和CacheBlend在NIAH上分别提升25.2%和35.1%，同时预填充时间加速达1.92倍。

Conclusion: CacheClip为RAG系统中的效率-质量权衡提供了实用解决方案，实现了快速TTFT和高质量生成。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems suffer from severe
time-to-first-token (TTFT) bottlenecks due to long input sequences. Existing KV
cache reuse methods face a fundamental trade-off: prefix caching requires
identical prefixes that rarely occur in RAG scenarios, while direct
precomputation sacrifices quality due to missing inter-chunk attention and
repeated attention sinks. Recent methods like APE and CacheBlend partially
address these issues but remain inadequate for robust RAG applications. This
paper presents CacheClip, a novel framework that achieves both fast TTFT and
high generation quality. Our key insight is that small auxiliary LLMs exhibit
similar last-layer attention distributions to primary LLMs (the target model
for generation), enabling efficient identification of tokens critical for
restoring inter-chunk attention, thereby significantly improving response
quality on cross-chunk reasoning tasks. CacheClip integrates three techniques:
(1) auxiliary-model-guided token selection for selective KV cache
recomputation, where the auxiliary model is finetuned to improve selection
accuracy, (2) shared prefixes to eliminate redundant attention sinks, and (3)
grouping strategy to maintain local coherence during partial KV cache updates.
Experiments show CacheClip retains up to 94.8% and 85.0% of full-attention
performance on NIAH and LongBench, outperforming APE and CacheBlend by 25.2%
and 35.1% on NIAH (with reomp% = 20%). Meanwhile, CacheClip accelerates LLM
inference by up to 1.92x in prefill time, providing a practical solution to the
efficiency-quality trade-off in RAG systems.

Abstract: Channel permutation is a powerful technique for enhancing the accuracy of N:M
sparse models by reordering the channels of weight matrices to prioritize the
retention of important weights. However, traditional channel permutation
methods rely on handcrafted quality metrics, which often fail to accurately
capture the true impact of pruning on model performance. To address this
limitation, we propose PermLLM, a novel post-training pruning framework that
introduces learnable channel permutation (LCP) for N:M sparsity. LCP leverages
Sinkhorn normalization to transform discrete permutation matrices into
differentiable soft permutation matrices, enabling end-to-end optimization.
Additionally, PermLLM incorporates an efficient block-wise channel permutation
strategy, which significantly reduces the number of learnable parameters and
computational complexity. PermLLM seamlessly integrates with existing one-shot
pruning methods to adaptively optimize channel permutations, effectively
mitigating pruning-induced errors. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA series,
Qwen, and OPT models demonstrate that PermLLM achieves superior performance in
optimizing N:M sparse models. The code is available at

Conclusion: Cyc-Attack方法有效克服了传统对抗攻击在天气预报领域的局限性，为评估深度学习气象模型的安全性提供了新工具。

Abstract: Deep learning based weather forecasting (DLWF) models leverage past weather
observations to generate future forecasts, supporting a wide range of
downstream tasks, including tropical cyclone (TC) trajectory prediction. In
this paper, we investigate their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, where
subtle perturbations to the upstream weather forecasts can alter the downstream
TC trajectory predictions. Although research on adversarial attacks in DLWF
models has grown recently, generating perturbed upstream forecasts that
reliably steer downstream output toward attacker-specified trajectories remains
a challenge. First, conventional TC detection systems are opaque,
non-differentiable black boxes, making standard gradient-based attacks
infeasible. Second, the extreme rarity of TC events leads to severe class
imbalance problem, making it difficult to develop efficient attack methods that
will produce the attacker's target trajectories. Furthermore, maintaining
physical consistency in adversarially generated forecasts presents another
significant challenge. To overcome these limitations, we propose Cyc-Attack, a
novel method that perturbs the upstream forecasts of DLWF models to generate
adversarial trajectories. First, we pre-train a differentiable surrogate model
to approximate the TC detector's output, enabling the construction of
gradient-based attacks. Cyc-Attack also employs skewness-aware loss function
with kernel dilation strategy to address the imbalance problem. Finally, a
distance-based gradient weighting scheme and regularization are used to
constrain the perturbations and eliminate spurious trajectories to ensure the
adversarial forecasts are realistic and not easily detectable.

Conclusion: FIRE通过频域分解的数学抽象，为不同类型时间序列提供了可解释且鲁棒的预测解决方案，在性能和可解释性方面均表现出色。

Abstract: Current approaches for time series forecasting, whether in the time or
frequency domain, predominantly use deep learning models based on linear layers
or transformers. They often encode time series data in a black-box manner and
rely on trial-and-error optimization solely based on forecasting performance,
leading to limited interpretability and theoretical understanding. Furthermore,
the dynamics in data distribution over time and frequency domains pose a
critical challenge to accurate forecasting. We propose FIRE, a unified
frequency domain decomposition framework that provides a mathematical
abstraction for diverse types of time series, so as to achieve interpretable
and robust time series forecasting. FIRE introduces several key innovations:
(i) independent modeling of amplitude and phase components, (ii) adaptive
learning of weights of frequency basis components, (iii) a targeted loss
function, and (iv) a novel training paradigm for sparse data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that FIRE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
models on long-term forecasting benchmarks, achieving superior predictive
performance and significantly enhancing interpretability of time series

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have the generative controllability by
incorporating external conditions. However, their performance significantly
degrades with noisy conditions, such as corrupted labels in the image
generation or unreliable observations or states in the control policy
generation. This paper introduces a robust learning framework to address
extremely noisy conditions in conditional diffusion models. We empirically
demonstrate that existing noise-robust methods fail when the noise level is
high. To overcome this, we propose learning pseudo conditions as surrogates for
clean conditions and refining pseudo ones progressively via the technique of
temporal ensembling. Additionally, we develop a Reverse-time Diffusion
Condition (RDC) technique, which diffuses pseudo conditions to reinforce the
memorization effect and further facilitate the refinement of the pseudo
conditions. Experimentally, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a range of noise levels on both class-conditional image generation and
visuomotor policy generation tasks.The code can be accessible via the project

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can enhance LLM
reasoning, its training process poses a critical risk: entropy collapse. This
phenomenon is a rapid loss of policy diversity, stemming from the
exploration-exploitation imbalance and leading to a lack of generalization.
Recent entropy-intervention methods aim to prevent \coloredtext{entropy
collapse}, yet their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this paper, we
conduct a quantitative analysis to reveal token-level entropy changes and how
existing entropy intervention methods help avoid entropy collapse. Our findings
point out a fundamental limitation of existing methods: they attempt to control
entropy dynamics indirectly. By only affecting related factors, such as the
advantage signal and generation probability, their effectiveness is inherently
limited and could potentially fail. To address this limitation, we introduce an
entropy-change-aware reweighting scheme, namely Stabilizing Token-level
Entropy-changE via Reweighting (STEER), that adaptively stabilizes entropy
dynamics through fine-grained token-level adjustments. Our approach mitigates
over-exploitation while fostering robust exploration. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that STEER significantly mitigates entropy collapse, stabilizes
entropy dynamics, and achieves stronger downstream performance across various
mathematical reasoning benchmarks \footnote{Our code is available at

Conclusion: CauchyNet作为一种有效且高效的数据驱动预测建模工具，特别适用于资源受限和数据稀缺环境。

Abstract: A novel neural network inspired by Cauchy's integral formula, is proposed for
function approximation tasks that include time series forecasting, missing data
imputation, etc. Hence, the novel neural network is named CauchyNet. By
embedding real-valued data into the complex plane, CauchyNet efficiently
captures complex temporal dependencies, surpassing traditional real-valued
models in both predictive performance and computational efficiency. Grounded in
Cauchy's integral formula and supported by the universal approximation theorem,
CauchyNet offers strong theoretical guarantees for function approximation. The
architecture incorporates complex-valued activation functions, enabling robust
learning from incomplete data while maintaining a compact parameter footprint
and reducing computational overhead. Through extensive experiments in diverse
domains, including transportation, energy consumption, and epidemiological
data, CauchyNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in predictive
accuracy, often achieving a 50% lower mean absolute error with fewer
parameters. These findings highlight CauchyNet's potential as an effective and
efficient tool for data-driven predictive modeling, particularly in

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a promising framework for improving reasoning abilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, policy optimized with binary verification prone to
overlook potential valuable exploration in reasoning trajectory. In view of
heavy annotation cost of golden Process Reward Models (PRMs), recent works
attempt using auxiliary signals for reward shaping of process tokens, involving
entropy and likelihood collected from logit space. In this work, we offer a
novel perspective on shaping RLVR with flow rewards derived from latent space,
and propose RLFR, where the flow fields of model latents are constructed from
either off-policy high-quality data and on-policy rejection sampling data, and
the velocity deviations of policy latents within it are quantified to serve as
a reward signal. RLFR first demonstrates that a well-established flow field can
be a sound environment for reward signal collection, highlighting the
expressive latent space is much underexplored. Moreover, RLFR is able to
compress any off-policy expert data as reference for constituting reward
signals, and we show that the efficient context dependence compressed within
the hidden states are utilized, rather than individual token-level denotation
for context comprehending. Experiments on both language and multimodal
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the reliability of flow rewards, and
suggesting a promising paradigm for reward shaping with auxiliary signals.

Conclusion: GraphBFN通过统一训练与推理过程，有效解决了连续扩散模型在分子图生成中的根本限制，实现了更好的性能和效率。

Abstract: Molecular graph generation is essentially a classification generation
problem, aimed at predicting categories of atoms and bonds. Currently,
prevailing paradigms such as continuous diffusion models are trained to predict
continuous numerical values, treating the training process as a regression
task. However, the final generation necessitates a rounding step to convert
these predictions back into discrete classification categories, which is
intrinsically a classification operation. Given that the rounding operation is
not incorporated during training, there exists a significant discrepancy
between the model's training objective and its inference procedure. As a
consequence, an excessive emphasis on point-wise precision can lead to
overfitting and inefficient learning. This occurs because considerable efforts
are devoted to capturing intra-bin variations that are ultimately irrelevant to
the discrete nature of the task at hand. Such a flaw results in diminished
molecular diversity and constrains the model's generalization capabilities. To
address this fundamental limitation, we propose GraphBFN, a novel hierarchical
coarse-to-fine framework based on Bayesian Flow Networks that operates on the
parameters of distributions. By innovatively introducing Cumulative
Distribution Function, GraphBFN is capable of calculating the probability of
selecting the correct category, thereby unifying the training objective with
the sampling rounding operation. We demonstrate that our method achieves
superior performance and faster generation, setting new state-of-the-art
results on the QM9 and ZINC250k molecular graph generation benchmarks.

Conclusion: 这些结果将SGM定位为学习系统中持续、风险感知自修改的基础设施。

Abstract: Recursive self-modification is increasingly central in AutoML, neural
architecture search, and adaptive optimization, yet no existing framework
ensures that such changes are made safely. Godel machines offer a principled
safeguard by requiring formal proofs of improvement before rewriting code;
however, such proofs are unattainable in stochastic, high-dimensional settings.
We introduce the Statistical Godel Machine (SGM), the first statistical safety
layer for recursive edits. SGM replaces proof-based requirements with
statistical confidence tests (e-values, Hoeffding bounds), admitting a
modification only when superiority is certified at a chosen confidence level,
while allocating a global error budget to bound cumulative risk across
rounds.We also propose Confirm-Triggered Harmonic Spending (CTHS), which
indexes spending by confirmation events rather than rounds, concentrating the
error budget on promising edits while preserving familywise
validity.Experiments across supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and
black-box optimization validate this role: SGM certifies genuine gains on
CIFAR-100, rejects spurious improvement on ImageNet-100, and demonstrates
robustness on RL and optimization benchmarks.Together, these results position
SGM as foundational infrastructure for continual, risk-aware self-modification
in learning systems.Code is available at:

Abstract: Soil moisture (SM) plays a critical role in hydrological and meteorological
processes. High-resolution SM can be obtained by combining coarse passive
microwave data with fine-scale auxiliary variables. However, the inversion of
SM at the temporal scale is hindered by the incompleteness of surface auxiliary
factors. To address this issue, first, we introduce validated high temporal
resolution ERA5-Land variables into the downscaling process of the
low-resolution SMAP SM product. Subsequently, we design a progressive scale
convolutional network (PSCNet), at the core of which are two innovative
components: a multi-frequency temporal fusion module (MFTF) for capturing
temporal dynamics, and a bespoke squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block designed to
preserve fine-grained spatial details. Using this approach, we obtained
seamless SM products for the Tibetan Plateau (TP) from 2016 to 2018 at 10-km
spatial and 3-hour temporal resolution. The experimental results on the TP
demonstrated the following: 1) In the satellite product validation, the PSCNet
exhibited comparable accuracy and lower error, with a mean R value of 0.881,
outperforming other methods. 2) In the in-situ site validation, PSCNet
consistently ranked among the top three models for the R metric across all
sites, while also showing superior performance in overall error reduction. 3)
In the temporal generalization validation, the feasibility of using
high-temporal resolution ERA5-Land variables for downscaling was confirmed, as
all methods maintained an average relative error within 6\% for the R metric
and 2\% for the ubRMSE metric. 4) In the temporal dynamics and visualization
validation, PSCNet demonstrated excellent temporal sensitivity and vivid
spatial details. Overall, PSCNet provides a promising solution for
spatio-temporal downscaling by effectively modeling the intricate
spatio-temporal relationships in SM data.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is crucial for drug discovery and materials
science, yet existing approaches suffer from limited interpretability, poor

followed by Reinforcement Learning from Principle-Guided Rewards (RLPGR). RLPGR
employs verifiable, rule-based rewards that systematically evaluate chemical

through computational verification. Extensive experiments across 8 datasets
demonstrate significant performance improvements, with MPPReasoner
outperforming the best baselines by 7.91\% and 4.53\% on in-distribution and

Abstract: Exploring machine learning techniques for addressing vehicle routing problems
has attracted considerable research attention. To achieve decent and efficient
solutions, existing deep models for vehicle routing problems are typically
trained and evaluated using instances of a single size. This substantially
limits their ability to generalize across different problem sizes and thus
hampers their practical applicability. To address the issue, we propose a
continual learning based framework that sequentially trains a deep model with
instances of ascending problem sizes. Specifically, on the one hand, we design
an inter-task regularization scheme to retain the knowledge acquired from
smaller problem sizes in the model training on a larger size. On the other
hand, we introduce an intra-task regularization scheme to consolidate the model
by imitating the latest desirable behaviors during training on each size.
Additionally, we exploit the experience replay to revisit instances of formerly
trained sizes for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results
show that our approach achieves predominantly superior performance across
various problem sizes (either seen or unseen in the training), as compared to
state-of-the-art deep models including the ones specialized for
generalizability enhancement. Meanwhile, the ablation studies on the key
designs manifest their synergistic effect in the proposed framework.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在长文本中性能下降的"lost-in-the-middle"现象，探索这种现象是否反映了人类记忆中的首因效应和近因效应，并理解其背后的训练机制。

Method: 通过从零开始训练GPT-2和Llama变体模型，使用模拟长期和短期记忆需求的简单人类记忆范式，分析位置偏差的形成机制，包括自回归特性和注意力汇的形成。

Result: 研究发现U形性能曲线确实在训练中出现，近因效应与训练数据中的短期记忆需求直接对应，而首因效应由均匀长期记忆需求诱导，并受到模型自回归特性和注意力汇形成的影响。

Conclusion: 信息检索需求、模型架构和训练过程中的结构注意力动态共同产生了LLMs中观察到的位置偏差，这种现象是训练过程中对不同记忆需求的适应性结果而非简单的缺陷。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) often degrades when crucial
information is in the middle of a long context, a "lost-in-the-middle"
phenomenon that mirrors the primacy and recency effects in human memory. We
propose that this behavior is not simply a flaw indicative of information loss
but an adaptation to different information retrieval demands during
pre-training: some tasks require uniform recall across the entire input (a
long-term memory demand), while others prioritize the most recent information
(a short-term memory demand). Consistent with this view, we show that this
U-shaped performance curve emerges when LLMs (GPT-2 and Llama variants) are
trained from scratch on two simple human memory paradigms simulating long-term
and short-term memory demands. Our analysis reveals that while the recency
effect directly aligns with short-term memory demand in the training data, the
primacy effect is induced by the uniform long-term memory demand and is
additionally influenced by the model's autoregressive properties and the
formation of attention sinks. Our main findings from simple human memory
paradigms also generalize to a sequence completion task, which more closely
resembles the next-token prediction process in LLM pre-training. Together, our
findings reveal how information retrieval demands, model architecture, and
structural attention dynamics during model training can jointly produce
positional bias observed in LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VivaBench是一个多轮对话基准测试，用于评估LLM在临床推理中的表现，模拟医学培训中的口试场景，要求模型主动获取信息、选择检查并综合多步信息进行诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学基准测试主要评估知识回忆，通过单轮问题提供完整临床信息，而真实的临床推理是假设驱动的多轮过程，需要从有限信息中逐步完善诊断。

Method: 构建了1762个医生策划的临床小故事，作为交互式场景模拟医学口试，要求LLM代理主动询问相关发现、选择适当检查，并在多个步骤中综合信息以达到诊断。

Result: 当前LLM在完整描述的临床表现中诊断能力良好，但在不确定性下进行迭代诊断推理时性能显著下降，发现了与临床实践中常见认知错误类似的失败模式。

Conclusion: VivaBench为评估对话式医学AI系统提供了标准化基准，揭示了当前LLM在不确定性下推理和决策的基本局限性，有助于推动智能体AI研究。

Abstract: Clinical reasoning in medicine is a hypothesis-driven process where
physicians refine diagnoses from limited information through targeted history,
physical examination, and diagnostic investigations. In contrast, current
medical benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) primarily assess knowledge
recall through single-turn questions, where complete clinical information is
provided upfront. To address this gap, we introduce VivaBench, a multi-turn
benchmark that evaluates sequential clinical reasoning in LLM agents. Our
dataset consists of 1762 physician-curated clinical vignettes structured as
interactive scenarios that simulate a (oral) examination in medical training,
requiring agents to actively probe for relevant findings, select appropriate
investigations, and synthesize information across multiple steps to reach a
diagnosis. While current LLMs demonstrate competence in diagnosing conditions
from well-described clinical presentations, their performance degrades
significantly when required to navigate iterative diagnostic reasoning under
uncertainty in our evaluation. Our analysis identified several failure modes
that mirror common cognitive errors in clinical practice, including: (1)
fixation on initial hypotheses, (2) inappropriate investigation ordering, (3)
premature diagnostic closure, and (4) failing to screen for critical
conditions. These patterns reveal fundamental limitations in how current LLMs
reason and make decisions under uncertainty. Through VivaBench, we provide a
standardized benchmark for evaluating conversational medical AI systems for
real-world clinical decision support. Beyond medical applications, we
contribute to the larger corpus of research on agentic AI by demonstrating how
sequential reasoning trajectories can diverge in complex decision-making
environments.

TL;DR: ECHO是一个基于提示的框架，通过后见之明优化将强化学习中的后见之明经验回放应用于语言模型智能体，从失败的尝试中生成优化的替代目标轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型智能体在新环境中从顺序交互中学习时样本效率低下，这在交互成本高的环境中（如与人类交互或重置物理系统）严重阻碍了其有效性。

Method: ECHO包含两个组件：后见之明规则（使用语言模型识别相关子目标并生成优化轨迹）和更新规则（在内存中维护压缩的轨迹表示）。

Result: 在XMiniGrid和PeopleJoinQA两个领域的评估中，ECHO比普通语言智能体基线性能提升高达80%；在XMiniGrid中，它还超越了包括Reflexion和AWM在内的多个复杂智能体架构。

Conclusion: ECHO通过更有效地利用过去经验，展示了在新环境中更快的适应能力。

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents deployed in novel environments often exhibit poor
sample efficiency when learning from sequential interactions. This
significantly hinders the usefulness of such agents in environments where
interaction is costly (for example, when they interact with humans or reset
physical systems). While a number of existing LM agent architectures
incorporate various mechanisms for experience storage and reflection, they make
limited use of LMs' abilities to directly generate or reason about full
counterfactual trajectories. We introduce ECHO (Experience Consolidation via
Hindsight Optimization), a prompting framework that adapts hindsight experience
replay from reinforcement learning for language model agents. ECHO generates
optimized trajectories for alternative goals that could have been achieved
during failed attempts, effectively creating synthetic positive examples from
unsuccessful interactions. Our approach consists of two components: a hindsight
rule that uses the language model itself to identify relevant subgoals and
generate optimized trajectories, and an update rule that maintains compressed
trajectory representations in memory. We evaluate ECHO on stateful versions of
XMiniGrid, a text-based navigation and planning benchmark, and PeopleJoinQA, a
collaborative information-gathering enterprise simulation. Across both domains,
ECHO outperforms vanilla language agent baselines by up to 80%; in XMiniGrid,
it also outperforms a number of sophisticated agent architectures including
Reflexion and AWM, demonstrating faster adaptation to novel environments
through more effective utilization of past experiences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN在稠密图（如点云、分子相互作用）上效率低下，而通过相似度阈值或距离剪枝的图稀疏化方法会丢失其他尺度的关键信息。

Method: 采用多视图图元组框架，将图划分为不相交的子图，并通过受非交换算子理论启发的异构消息传递架构学习多视图表示。

Result: 在两个科学领域（分子性质预测和宇宙学参数推断）的应用中，多视图图元组模型比单图基线表现更好。

Conclusion: 多视图图元组框架在表达能力和性能上优于单图消息传递模型，展示了多视图方法的强大性和通用性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) typically scale with the number of graph edges,
making them well suited for sparse graphs but less efficient on dense graphs,
such as point clouds or molecular interactions. A common remedy is to sparsify
the graph via similarity thresholding or distance pruning, but this forces an
arbitrary choice of a single interaction scale and discards crucial information
from other scales. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view
graph-tuple framework. Instead of a single graph, our graph-tuple framework
partitions the graph into disjoint subgraphs, capturing primary local
interactions and weaker, long-range connections. We then learn multi-view
representations from the graph-tuple via a heterogeneous message-passing
architecture inspired by the theory of non-commuting operators, which we
formally prove is strictly more expressive and guarantees a lower oracle risk
compared to single-graph message-passing models. We instantiate our framework
on two scientific domains: molecular property prediction from feature-scarce
Coulomb matrices and cosmological parameter inference from geometric point
clouds. On both applications, our multi-view graph-tuple models demonstrate
better performance than single-graph baselines, highlighting the power and
versatility of our multi-view approach.

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于睡眠数据的非侵入性生物标志物，使用transformer模型分析可穿戴设备或无线传感器的睡眠数据来检测抗抑郁药物摄入，实现远程、无感的日常依从性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抗抑郁药物不依从现象普遍存在，导致复发、住院、自杀风险增加和巨额可避免成本。现有方法要么侵入性强（血清检测、神经影像），要么基于代理指标且不准确（药片计数、药房补药）。

Method: 使用基于transformer的模型分析来自消费级可穿戴设备或非接触式无线传感器的睡眠数据，推断抗抑郁药物摄入情况。

Result: 在包含62,000个夜晚、>20,000名参与者（1,800名抗抑郁药物使用者）的六个数据集中，生物标志物达到AUROC = 0.84，在不同药物类别间具有普适性，随剂量变化而扩展，并对伴随的精神药物保持稳健。纵向监测捕捉了现实世界中的用药开始、减量和漏服情况。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了客观、可扩展的依从性监测，具有改善抑郁症治疗和预后的潜力。

Abstract: Antidepressant nonadherence is pervasive, driving relapse, hospitalization,
suicide risk, and billions in avoidable costs. Clinicians need tools that
detect adherence lapses promptly, yet current methods are either invasive
(serum assays, neuroimaging) or proxy-based and inaccurate (pill counts,
pharmacy refills). We present the first noninvasive biomarker that detects
antidepressant intake from a single night of sleep. A transformer-based model
analyzes sleep data from a consumer wearable or contactless wireless sensor to
infer antidepressant intake, enabling remote, effortless, daily adherence
assessment at home. Across six datasets comprising 62,000 nights from >20,000
participants (1,800 antidepressant users), the biomarker achieved AUROC = 0.84,
generalized across drug classes, scaled with dose, and remained robust to
concomitant psychotropics. Longitudinal monitoring captured real-world
initiation, tapering, and lapses. This approach offers objective, scalable
adherence surveillance with potential to improve depression care and outcomes.

TL;DR: 本文研究多组均值估计问题，提出探索无关的分配算法，在严格次高斯分布下获得更紧的遗憾界，并扩展到上下文赌博机设置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多臂赌博机旨在通过识别最佳臂来最小化遗憾，而多组均值估计需要均匀准确地估计所有组的均值，这要求对每个组进行Θ(T)次采样，因此探索无关算法既自然又有效。

Method: 使用Hanson-Wright不等式加强次高斯方差集中性结果，识别严格次高斯分布类；设计探索无关的非自适应和自适应算法；将框架扩展到上下文赌博机设置，利用侧信息。

Result: 建立了比现有结果更紧的遗憾界；提出的算法在多组均值估计中表现出原则性和高效性。

Conclusion: 探索无关分配是多组均值估计的原则性高效方法，在实验设计、个性化等需要准确多组推断的领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: We address the problem of multi-group mean estimation, which seeks to
allocate a finite sampling budget across multiple groups to obtain uniformly
accurate estimates of their means. Unlike classical multi-armed bandits, whose
objective is to minimize regret by identifying and exploiting the best arm, the
optimal allocation in this setting requires sampling every group on the order
of $\Theta(T)$ times. This fundamental distinction makes exploration-free
algorithms both natural and effective. Our work makes three contributions.
First, we strengthen the existing results on subgaussian variance concentration
using the Hanson-Wright inequality and identify a class of strictly subgaussian
distributions that yield sharper guarantees. Second, we design exploration-free
non-adaptive and adaptive algorithms, and we establish tighter regret bounds
than the existing results. Third, we extend the framework to contextual bandit
settings, an underexplored direction, and propose algorithms that leverage side
information with provable guarantees. Overall, these results position
exploration-free allocation as a principled and efficient approach to
multi-group mean estimation, with potential applications in experimental
design, personalization, and other domains requiring accurate multi-group
inference.

*Kenichi Satoh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NMF-LAB是一种新的监督式非负矩阵分解方法，将分类问题重新定义为非负矩阵三因子分解的逆问题，直接从协变量映射到标签概率，无需外部分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的非负矩阵分解方法是无监督的，无法直接利用类别标签。现有的监督或半监督扩展通常只能通过惩罚项或图约束来整合标签，仍然需要外部分类器。

Method: NMF-LAB将标签矩阵Y作为观测值进行因子分解，而协变量A作为给定的解释变量。这种方法直接产生从协变量到标签的概率映射，支持核相似性和半监督学习。

Result: 在从基准数据集到大规模MNIST数据集的各种实验中，NMF-LAB实现了有竞争力的预测准确性，对噪声或不完整标签具有鲁棒性，并能扩展到高维问题，同时保持可解释性。

Conclusion: NMF-LAB通过将回归和分类统一在三因子NMF框架中，为现代分类任务提供了一种新颖、概率化且可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is widely used for dimensionality
reduction and interpretable analysis, but standard formulations are
unsupervised and cannot directly exploit class labels. Existing supervised or
semi-supervised extensions usually incorporate labels only via penalties or
graph constraints, still requiring an external classifier. We propose
\textit{NMF-LAB} (Non-negative Matrix Factorization for Label Matrix), which
redefines classification as the inverse problem of non-negative matrix
tri-factorization (tri-NMF). Unlike joint NMF methods, which reconstruct both
features and labels, NMF-LAB directly factorizes the label matrix $Y$ as the
observation, while covariates $A$ are treated as given explanatory variables.
This yields a direct probabilistic mapping from covariates to labels,
distinguishing our method from label-matrix factorization approaches that
mainly model label correlations or impute missing labels. Our inversion offers
two key advantages: (i) class-membership probabilities are obtained directly
from the factorization without a separate classifier, and (ii) covariates,
including kernel-based similarities, can be seamlessly integrated to generalize
predictions to unseen samples. In addition, unlabeled data can be encoded as
uniform distributions, supporting semi-supervised learning. Experiments on
diverse datasets, from small-scale benchmarks to the large-scale MNIST dataset,
demonstrate that NMF-LAB achieves competitive predictive accuracy, robustness
to noisy or incomplete labels, and scalability to high-dimensional problems,
while preserving interpretability. By unifying regression and classification
within the tri-NMF framework, NMF-LAB provides a novel, probabilistic, and
scalable approach to modern classification tasks.

TL;DR: TreeDiff是一个基于蒙特卡洛树搜索的双空间扩散框架，用于可控图生成，通过宏步扩展、双空间去噪和双空间验证器实现高效可控的图生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型在图生成中缺乏对期望属性的控制，导致质量不稳定且难以整合新目标。推理时间引导方法虽然无需重新训练，但本质上是局部的、启发式的，可控性有限。

Method: TreeDiff采用MCTS引导的双空间扩散框架，包含三个关键设计：宏步扩展策略减少树深度；双空间去噪机制结合潜在空间去噪和图空间离散校正；双空间验证器预测长期奖励，无需完整展开。

Result: 在2D和3D分子生成基准测试中，TreeDiff在无条件和有条件设置下均达到最先进性能，且推理时间扩展性良好，随着计算资源增加性能持续提升。

Conclusion: TreeDiff通过MCTS引导的双空间扩散框架，有效解决了现有图生成方法在可控性和质量稳定性方面的限制，实现了高效且可扩展的可控图生成。

Abstract: Graph generation is a fundamental problem in graph learning with broad
applications across Web-scale systems, knowledge graphs, and scientific domains
such as drug and material discovery. Recent approaches leverage diffusion
models for step-by-step generation, yet unconditional diffusion offers little
control over desired properties, often leading to unstable quality and
difficulty in incorporating new objectives. Inference-time guidance methods
mitigate these issues by adjusting the sampling process without retraining, but
they remain inherently local, heuristic, and limited in controllability. To
overcome these limitations, we propose TreeDiff, a Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) guided dual-space diffusion framework for controllable graph generation.
TreeDiff is a plug-and-play inference-time method that expands the search space
while keeping computation tractable. Specifically, TreeDiff introduces three
key designs to make it practical and scalable: (1) a macro-step expansion
strategy that groups multiple denoising updates into a single transition,
reducing tree depth and enabling long-horizon exploration; (2) a dual-space
denoising mechanism that couples efficient latent-space denoising with
lightweight discrete correction in graph space, ensuring both scalability and
structural fidelity; and (3) a dual-space verifier that predicts long-term
rewards from partially denoised graphs, enabling early value estimation and
removing the need for full rollouts. Extensive experiments on 2D and 3D
molecular generation benchmarks, under both unconditional and conditional
settings, demonstrate that TreeDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Notably, TreeDiff exhibits favorable inference-time scaling: it continues to
improve with additional computation, while existing inference-time methods
plateau early under limited resources.

TL;DR: 本文研究了transformer在分类任务中的上下文学习机制，发现即使使用非线性softmax激活函数，transformer仍能通过梯度下降在上下文中学习，并在核特征空间中进行优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论研究主要基于线性自注意力和连续回归任务，而transformer通常用于离散复杂任务。本文旨在填补这一空白，研究在分类任务和非线性softmax激活下的上下文学习机制。

Method: 分析transformer在分类任务中的学习算法，特别关注softmax激活函数下的梯度下降过程，包括核特征空间中的函数优化和上下文自适应学习率。

Result: 发现transformer在softmax激活下仍能进行上下文梯度下降学习，在核特征空间中优化函数，并具有上下文自适应学习率。实验验证了softmax注意力对上下文具有更强的适应性。

Conclusion: 该研究增强了在更现实场景下对上下文学习算法的理论理解，推进了对大模型学习机制的理解，为后续理论研究提供了基础。

Abstract: The remarkable ability of transformers to learn new concepts solely by
reading examples within the input prompt, termed in-context learning (ICL), is
a crucial aspect of intelligent behavior. Here, we focus on understanding the
learning algorithm transformers use to learn from context. Existing theoretical
work, often based on simplifying assumptions, has primarily focused on linear
self-attention and continuous regression tasks, finding transformers can learn
in-context by gradient descent. Given that transformers are typically trained
on discrete and complex tasks, we bridge the gap from this existing work to the
setting of classification, with non-linear (importantly, softmax) activation.
We find that transformers still learn to do gradient descent in-context, though
on functionals in the kernel feature space and with a context-adaptive learning
rate in the case of softmax transformer. These theoretical findings suggest a
greater adaptability to context for softmax attention, which we empirically
verify and study through ablations. Overall, we hope this enhances theoretical
understanding of in-context learning algorithms in more realistic settings,
pushes forward our intuitions and enables further theory bridging to larger
models.

TL;DR: HiLoMoE是一个分层LoRA MoE框架，通过参数高效的方式实现整体扩展，结合垂直和水平扩展的优势，在CTR预测任务中实现了更好的性能-效率权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的垂直扩展通过层堆叠提高模型表达能力，但顺序计算限制了扩展效率；而水平扩展的MoE方法虽然能高效扩展，但平坦的MoE层难以捕捉推荐任务中的层次结构。为了突破ROI边界，探索两种方向的互补优势。

Method: HiLoMoE采用轻量级rank-1专家进行参数高效的水平扩展，堆叠多个具有分层路由的MoE层以实现组合多样的专家组合。不同于传统堆叠，HiLoMoE基于前一层分数而非输出进行路由，允许所有层并行执行。采用三阶段训练框架确保稳定优化和专家多样性。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的实验表明，HiLoMoE实现了更好的性能-效率权衡，与非MoE基线相比，平均AUC提升0.20%，FLOPs减少18.5%。

Conclusion: HiLoMoE框架成功结合了垂直和水平扩展的优势，通过分层路由和参数高效的设计，在CTR预测任务中实现了优异的性能-效率平衡。

Abstract: Deep models have driven significant advances in click-through rate (CTR)
prediction. While vertical scaling via layer stacking improves model
expressiveness, the layer-by-layer sequential computation poses challenges to
efficient scaling. Conversely, horizontal scaling through Mixture of Experts
(MoE) achieves efficient scaling by activating a small subset of experts in
parallel, but flat MoE layers may struggle to capture the hierarchical
structure inherent in recommendation tasks. To push the Return-On-Investment
(ROI) boundary, we explore the complementary strengths of both directions and
propose HiLoMoE, a hierarchical LoRA MoE framework that enables holistic
scaling in a parameter-efficient manner. Specifically, HiLoMoE employs
lightweight rank-1 experts for parameter-efficient horizontal scaling, and
stacks multiple MoE layers with hierarchical routing to enable combinatorially
diverse expert compositions. Unlike conventional stacking, HiLoMoE routes based
on prior layer scores rather than outputs, allowing all layers to execute in
parallel. A principled three-stage training framework ensures stable
optimization and expert diversity. Experiments on four public datasets show
that HiLoMoE achieving better performance-efficiency tradeoff, achieving an
average AUC improvement of 0.20\% in AUC and 18.5\% reduction in FLOPs compared
to the non-MoE baseline.

Conclusion: MTL-FSL框架通过建模特征间时变关系，显著提升了阿尔茨海默病预测的准确性和生物学可解释性

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in
aging populations, posing a significant and escalating burden on global
healthcare systems. While Multi-Tusk Learning (MTL) has emerged as a powerful
computational paradigm for modeling longitudinal AD data, existing frameworks
do not account for the time-varying nature of feature correlations. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel MTL framework, named Feature Similarity
Laplacian graph Multi-Task Learning (MTL-FSL). Our framework introduces a novel
Feature Similarity Laplacian (FSL) penalty that explicitly models the
time-varying relationships between features. By simultaneously considering
temporal smoothness among tasks and the dynamic correlations among features,
our model enhances both predictive accuracy and biological interpretability. To
solve the non-smooth optimization problem arising from our proposed penalty
terms, we adopt the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)
algorithm. Experiments conducted on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our proposed MTL-FSL framework
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming various baseline methods.

Motivation: 研究在计算速度大幅提升（如量子计算或大规模并行硬件）的背景下，机器学习是否仍然需要人类的初始监督和标注。

Method: 分析反向监督策略的搜索空间复杂度，该策略在大型未标注数据集上搜索标注以最小化小型标注数据集上的误差。

Result: 搜索空间为2^n，即使有常数倍的加速，复杂度仍然是指数级的。计算速度的提升只能减少运行时间，但不能消除对信息性标注或先验知识的需求。

Conclusion: 机器学习仍然需要人类的初始贡献来定义目标、类别和提供代表性标注。生成式AI可以作为标签放大器，但需要人类监督来确保质量和校准。

Abstract: We analyze a reversed-supervision strategy that searches over labelings of a
large unlabeled set \(B\) to minimize error on a small labeled set \(A\). The
search space is \(2^n\), and the resulting complexity remains exponential even
under large constant-factor speedups (e.g., quantum or massively parallel
hardware). Consequently, arbitrarily fast -- but not exponentially faster --
computation does not obviate the need for informative labels or priors. In
practice, the machine learning pipeline still requires an initial human
contribution: specifying the objective, defining classes, and providing a seed
set of representative annotations that inject inductive bias and align models
with task semantics. Synthetic labels from generative AI can partially
substitute provided their quality is human-grade and anchored by a
human-specified objective, seed supervision, and validation. In this view,
generative models function as \emph{label amplifiers}, leveraging small
human-curated cores via active, semi-supervised, and self-training loops, while
humans retain oversight for calibration, drift detection, and failure auditing.
Thus, extreme computational speed reduces wall-clock time but not the
fundamental supervision needs of learning; initial human (or human-grade) input
remains necessary to ground the system in the intended task.

Abstract: Simulators of animal movements play a valuable role in studying behavior.
Advances in imitation learning for robotics have expanded possibilities for
reproducing human and animal movements. A key challenge for realistic
multi-animal simulation in biology is bridging the gap between unknown
real-world transition models and their simulated counterparts. Because
locomotion dynamics are seldom known, relying solely on mathematical models is
insufficient; constructing a simulator that both reproduces real trajectories
and supports reward-driven optimization remains an open problem. We introduce a
data-driven simulator for multi-animal behavior based on deep reinforcement
learning and counterfactual simulation. We address the ill-posed nature of the
problem caused by high degrees of freedom in locomotion by estimating movement
variables of an incomplete transition model as actions within an RL framework.
We also employ a distance-based pseudo-reward to align and compare states
between cyber and physical spaces. Validated on artificial agents, flies,
newts, and silkmoth, our approach achieves higher reproducibility of
species-specific behaviors and improved reward acquisition compared with
standard imitation and RL methods. Moreover, it enables counterfactual behavior
prediction in novel experimental settings and supports multi-individual
modeling for flexible what-if trajectory generation, suggesting its potential

TL;DR: 提出了LightSAE框架，通过共享-辅助嵌入分解来解决多变量时间序列预测中的表示瓶颈问题，在参数效率显著提升的同时实现性能改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用共享嵌入层处理所有通道，忽略了通道特异性信息，造成表示瓶颈。

Method: 引入共享-辅助嵌入(SAE)框架，将嵌入分解为共享基础组件和通道特定辅助组件，并利用低秩分解和共享门控组件池实现参数高效的LightSAE模块。

Result: 在9个IoT相关数据集和4个骨干架构上的实验表明，LightSAE仅增加4.0%参数即可实现高达22.8%的MSE改进。

Conclusion: SAE框架有效解决了多变量时间序列预测中的表示瓶颈问题，LightSAE在保持参数效率的同时显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Modern Internet of Things (IoT) systems generate massive, heterogeneous
multivariate time series data. Accurate Multivariate Time Series Forecasting
(MTSF) of such data is critical for numerous applications. However, existing
methods almost universally employ a shared embedding layer that processes all
channels identically, creating a representational bottleneck that obscures
valuable channel-specific information. To address this challenge, we introduce
a Shared-Auxiliary Embedding (SAE) framework that decomposes the embedding into
a shared base component capturing common patterns and channel-specific
auxiliary components modeling unique deviations. Within this decomposition, we
\rev{empirically observe} that the auxiliary components tend to exhibit
low-rank and clustering characteristics, a structural pattern that is
significantly less apparent when using purely independent embeddings.
Consequently, we design LightSAE, a parameter-efficient embedding module that
operationalizes these observed characteristics through low-rank factorization
and a shared, gated component pool. Extensive experiments across 9 IoT-related
datasets and 4 backbone architectures demonstrate LightSAE's effectiveness,
achieving MSE improvements of up to 22.8\% with only 4.0\% parameter increase.

TL;DR: AnyBCQ是一种硬件友好的多精度量化方法，通过二进制位平面表示权重，支持直接位平面操作和动态精度选择，在低比特（如2位）下显著减少精度损失，同时实现高达3.0倍的吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: AnyBCQ通过算法灵活性与硬件效率的对齐，为多精度LLM部署提供了实用基础，能够满足多样化的服务级别目标。

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly constrained by
memory and latency bottlenecks, motivating the need for quantization techniques
that flexibly balance accuracy and efficiency. Recent work has introduced
multi-precision models, which enable inference at multiple precisions within a
single model depending on runtime constraints. To support such flexibility,
quantized weights are often stored as bit-planes, where hardware efficiency
improves when the compute operates directly at the bit-plane level and
activates only the precision required by each request. In this work, we present
AnyBCQ, a hardware-friendly multi-precision extension of Binary-Coded
Quantization (BCQ) that supports direct bit-plane operations. By representing
weights as binary bit-planes with corresponding scale factors, AnyBCQ enables
bit-plane-level computation and maps naturally to accelerator-friendly,
bit-parallel arithmetic. Our progressive precision expansion mechanism
incrementally refines scaling factors while reusing previously assigned binary
codes, yielding monotonic improvements in accuracy as additional bits are
enabled. We further co-design a specialized kernel that exploits the BCQ
structure to support dynamic per-request precision selection with negligible
overhead. Experiments on recent LLMs demonstrate that AnyBCQ significantly
narrows the accuracy drop in the low-bit regime (e.g. 2-bit), remains
competitive at higher precision, and achieves throughput gains of up to 3.0x
over half precision and 1.2x over state-of-the-art multi-precision methods. By
aligning algorithmic flexibility with hardware efficiency, AnyBCQ provides a
practical foundation for multi-precision LLM deployment across diverse
service-level objectives.

*Zhijian Zhou,Liuhua Peng,Xunye Tian,Feng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于锚点的最大差异(AMD)方法，用于相对相似性测试，通过同时学习假设和核函数来解决现有方法中核选择与假设指定顺序的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于核的相对相似性测试方法在手动指定备择假设后选择核函数，这会导致测试结果失真，因为总能找到使假设被拒绝的核函数。

Method: 提出AMD方法，在深度核空间中同时学习假设和核函数。分为两个阶段：第一阶段估计AMD并推断潜在假设，第二阶段评估假设的统计显著性。

Result: 理论验证和基准数据集上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: AMD方法通过同时学习假设和核函数，解决了相对相似性测试中的核选择问题，为相对相似性测试提供了更可靠的方法。

Abstract: The relative similarity testing aims to determine which of the distributions,
P or Q, is closer to an anchor distribution U. Existing kernel-based approaches
often test the relative similarity with a fixed kernel in a manually specified
alternative hypothesis, e.g., Q is closer to U than P. Although kernel
selection is known to be important to kernel-based testing methods, the
manually specified hypothesis poses a significant challenge for kernel
selection in relative similarity testing: Once the hypothesis is specified
first, we can always find a kernel such that the hypothesis is rejected. This
challenge makes relative similarity testing ill-defined when we want to select
a good kernel after the hypothesis is specified. In this paper, we cope with
this challenge via learning a proper hypothesis and a kernel simultaneously,
instead of learning a kernel after manually specifying the hypothesis. We
propose an anchor-based maximum discrepancy (AMD), which defines the relative
similarity as the maximum discrepancy between the distances of (U, P) and (U,
Q) in a space of deep kernels. Based on AMD, our testing incorporates two
phases. In Phase I, we estimate the AMD over the deep kernel space and infer
the potential hypothesis. In Phase II, we assess the statistical significance
of the potential hypothesis, where we propose a unified testing framework to
derive thresholds for tests over different possible hypotheses from Phase I.
Lastly, we validate our method theoretically and demonstrate its effectiveness
via extensive experiments on benchmark datasets. Codes are publicly available

Conclusion: 该工作建立了蛋白质结合剂设计的新范式，成功将基于检索的知识与生成式AI相结合，为药物发现开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Designing protein binders targeting specific sites, which requires to
generate realistic and functional interaction patterns, is a fundamental
challenge in drug discovery. Current structure-based generative models are
limited in generating nterfaces with sufficient rationality and
interpretability. In this paper, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion for
Aligned interface (RADiAnce), a new framework that leverages known interfaces
to guide the design of novel binders. By unifying retrieval and generation in a
shared contrastive latent space, our model efficiently identifies relevant
interfaces for a given binding site and seamlessly integrates them through a
conditional latent diffusion generator, enabling cross-domain interface
transfer. Extensive exeriments show that RADiAnce significantly outperforms
baseline models across multiple metrics, including binding affinity and
recovery of geometries and interactions. Additional experimental results
validate cross-domain generalization, demonstrating that retrieving interfaces
from diverse domains, such as peptides, antibodies, and protein fragments,
enhances the generation performance of binders for other domains. Our work
establishes a new paradigm for protein binder design that successfully bridges
retrieval-based knowledge and generative AI, opening new possibilities for drug
discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了梯度增强自训练PINN（gST-PINN）方法，通过梯度伪点自学习算法解决传统PINNs精度有限、训练慢、缺乏标签数据等问题，在多种PDE问题上表现优于标准PINN。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs存在精度有限、训练动态缓慢、缺乏标签数据和多物理场交互处理不足等问题，需要改进方法来解决这些挑战。

Method: 提出梯度增强自训练PINN（gST-PINN）方法，引入基于梯度的伪点自学习算法，是一种纯半监督方法，无需PDE解即可工作。

Result: 在三个不同类型PDE问题上测试，gST-PINN在Burgers方程和扩散-吸附方程上分别达到10^{-5}量级的MSE，优于标准PINN的10^{-3}和10^{-4}量级，且持续收敛。

Conclusion: gST-PINN在缺乏标签数据情况下仍能超越标准PINN，解决了低精度和收敛问题，泛化了PINN和gPINN方法。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) provide a mathematical foundation for
simulating and understanding intricate behaviors in both physical sciences and
engineering. With the growing capabilities of deep learning, data$-$driven
approaches like Physics$-$Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been developed,
offering a mesh$-$free, analytic type framework for efficiently solving PDEs
across a wide range of applications. However, traditional PINNs often struggle
with challenges such as limited precision, slow training dynamics, lack of
labeled data availability, and inadequate handling of multi$-$physics
interactions. To overcome these challenging issues of PINNs, we proposed a
Gradient Enhanced Self$-$Training PINN (gST$-$PINN) method that specifically
introduces a gradient based pseudo point self$-$learning algorithm for solving
PDEs. We tested the proposed method on three different types of PDE problems
from various fields, each representing distinct scenarios. The effectiveness of
the proposed method is evident, as the PINN approach for solving the Burgers$'$
equation attains a mean square error (MSE) on the order of $10^{-3}$, while the
diffusion$-$sorption equation achieves an MSE on the order of $10^{-4}$ after
12,500 iterations, with no further improvement as the iterations increase. In
contrast, the MSE for both PDEs in the gST$-$PINN model continues to decrease,
demonstrating better generalization and reaching an MSE on the order of
$10^{-5}$ after 18,500 iterations. Furthermore, the results show that the
proposed purely semi$-$supervised gST$-$PINN consistently outperforms the
standard PINN method in all cases, even when solution of the PDEs are
unavailable. It generalizes both PINN and Gradient$-$enhanced PINN (gPINN), and
can be effectively applied in scenarios prone to low accuracy and convergence
issues, particularly in the absence of labeled data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Align2Act是一个将指令调优的大型语言模型转化为可解释运动规划器的框架，通过结构化驾驶指令和逐步推理生成安全轨迹，在nuPlan基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用预定义规则或从驾驶数据学习生成轨迹，最近的方法利用LLMs进行决策，但LLMs是否真正理解人类驾驶逻辑仍不明确。

Method: 提出Align2Act框架，基于人类推理模式和交通规则推导结构化驾驶指令，通过Align2ActChain模块进行逐步推理，使用LoRA在nuPlan数据集上微调LLaMA-2-7B。

Result: 在nuPlan Test14-random测试中，开环得分85.17，闭环得分70.31（非反应式）和66.96（反应式），在真实世界闭环基准测试中显示出改进的规划质量和人类相似性。

Conclusion: 结构化推理显著提升了基于LLM的规划器性能，验证了Align2Act框架在运动规划中的有效性。

Abstract: Motion planning in complex scenarios is a core challenge in autonomous
driving. Conventional methods apply predefined rules or learn from driving data
to generate trajectories, while recent approaches leverage large language
models (LLMs) for decision-making. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs
truly capture human driving logic. We propose Align2Act, a motion planning
framework that transforms instruction-tuned LLMs into interpretable planners
aligned with human behavior. We derive structured driving instructions based on
human reasoning patterns (e.g., anticipate hazards, yield at intersections) and
traffic rules (e.g., stop at red lights, maintain lane boundaries). Our
Align2ActChain module guides step-by-step reasoning to produce both an
interpretable rationale and a safe trajectory. By fine-tuning LLaMA-2-7B with
LoRA on one million scenarios from the nuPlan dataset, our method achieves an
open-loop score of 85.17 and closed-loop scores of 70.31 (non-reactive) and
66.96 (reactive) on Test14-random. Unlike prior work focused on synthetic or
open-loop settings, we demonstrate improved planning quality and human-likeness
on the real-world nuPlan closed-loop benchmark. Ablation studies confirm that
structured reasoning significantly improves performance over baseline LLM
planners.

Motivation: 现有影响力估计方法在训练随机性下不稳定，同一样本在不同训练中可能被评估为关键或无关，这影响了在数据清理等应用中的可靠性。

Method: 基于假设检验的f-influence框架，设计了f-INE算法，可在单次训练中计算样本影响力，并扩展到大型语言模型指令调优数据。

Conclusion: f-influence框架解决了训练随机性带来的影响力估计不稳定问题，为可靠的数据清理和模型行为分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Influence estimation methods promise to explain and debug machine learning by
estimating the impact of individual samples on the final model. Yet, existing
methods collapse under training randomness: the same example may appear
critical in one run and irrelevant in the next. Such instability undermines
their use in data curation or cleanup since it is unclear if we indeed
deleted/kept the correct datapoints. To overcome this, we introduce
*f-influence* -- a new influence estimation framework grounded in hypothesis
testing that explicitly accounts for training randomness, and establish
desirable properties that make it suitable for reliable influence estimation.
We also design a highly efficient algorithm **f**-**IN**fluence **E**stimation
(**f-INE**) that computes f-influence **in a single training run**. Finally, we
scale up f-INE to estimate influence of instruction tuning data on Llama-3.1-8B
and show it can reliably detect poisoned samples that steer model opinions,
demonstrating its utility for data cleanup and attributing model behavior.

Motivation: 医疗研究和开发面临数据稀缺和严格隐私法规的限制，阻碍了AI模型创新和患者护理的进步。合成数据生成提供了在保护隐私的同时模拟真实数据统计特性的解决方案。

Abstract: Healthcare research and development face significant obstacles due to data
scarcity and stringent privacy regulations, such as HIPAA and the GDPR,
restricting access to essential real-world medical data. These limitations
impede innovation, delay robust AI model creation, and hinder advancements in
patient-centered care. Synthetic data generation offers a transformative
solution by producing artificial datasets that emulate real data statistics
while safeguarding patient privacy. We introduce a novel hybrid framework for
high-fidelity healthcare data synthesis integrating five augmentation methods:
noise injection, interpolation, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) sampling,
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) sampling, and SMOTE, combined via a
reinforcement learning-based dynamic weight selection mechanism. Its key
innovations include advanced calibration techniques -- moment matching, full
histogram matching, soft and adaptive soft histogram matching, and iterative
refinement -- that align marginal distributions and preserve joint feature
dependencies. Evaluated on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (UCI Repository) and
Khulna Medical College cardiology datasets, our calibrated hybrid achieves
Wasserstein distances as low as 0.001 and Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics around
0.01, demonstrating near-zero marginal discrepancy. Pairwise trend scores
surpass 90%, and Nearest Neighbor Adversarial Accuracy approaches 50%,
confirming robust privacy protection. Downstream classifiers trained on
synthetic data achieve up to 94% accuracy and F1 scores above 93%, comparable
to models trained on real data. This scalable, privacy-preserving approach
matches state-of-the-art methods, sets new benchmarks for joint-distribution
fidelity in healthcare, and supports sensitive AI applications.

Conclusion: 该框架能够同时优化迁移路径和目标任务性能，有效提升域自适应过程的效果，为无监督连续域自适应提供了新思路。

Abstract: Continuous Domain Adaptation (CDA) effectively bridges significant domain
shifts by progressively adapting from the source domain through intermediate
domains to the target domain. However, selecting intermediate domains without
explicit metadata remains a substantial challenge that has not been extensively
explored in existing studies. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel
framework that combines reinforcement learning with feature disentanglement to
conduct domain path selection in an unsupervised CDA setting. Our approach
introduces an innovative unsupervised reward mechanism that leverages the
distances between latent domain embeddings to facilitate the identification of
optimal transfer paths. Furthermore, by disentangling features, our method
facilitates the calculation of unsupervised rewards using domain-specific
features and promotes domain adaptation by aligning domain-invariant features.
This integrated strategy is designed to simultaneously optimize transfer paths
and target task performance, enhancing the effectiveness of domain adaptation
processes. Extensive empirical evaluations on datasets such as Rotated MNIST
and ADNI demonstrate substantial improvements in prediction accuracy and domain
selection efficiency, establishing our method's superiority over traditional
CDA approaches.

Motivation: 现有基准测试无法可靠地区分RL在LLMs中的真实进展，因为训练集和测试集的性能差距很小，表明基准测试存在设计缺陷。

Method: 引入诊断套件和Oracle性能差距(OPG)指标，通过压力测试分析RL方法在分布偏移、难度变化和反事实场景下的泛化能力。

Result: 尽管基准测试分数很高，但现有RL方法在泛化方面表现不佳，无法应对分布偏移、难度变化和反事实场景。

Conclusion: 当前基准测试不足以评估泛化能力，提出了设计更可靠基准测试的三个核心原则：足够难度、平衡评估和分布鲁棒性。

Abstract: Current benchmarks are inadequate for evaluating progress in reinforcement
learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs).Despite recent benchmark gains
reported for RL, we find that training on these benchmarks' training sets
achieves nearly the same performance as training directly on the test sets,
suggesting that the benchmarks cannot reliably separate further progress.To
study this phenomenon, we introduce a diagnostic suite and the Oracle
Performance Gap (OPG) metric that quantifies the performance difference between
training on the train split versus the test split of a benchmark. We further
analyze this phenomenon with stress tests and find that, despite strong
benchmark scores, existing RL methods struggle to generalize across
distribution shifts, varying levels of difficulty, and counterfactual
scenarios: shortcomings that current benchmarks fail to reveal.We conclude that
current benchmarks are insufficient for evaluating generalization and propose
three core principles for designing more faithful benchmarks: sufficient
difficulty, balanced evaluation, and distributional robustness.

Abstract: We derive a novel PAC-Bayesian generalization bound for reinforcement
learning that explicitly accounts for Markov dependencies in the data, through
the chain's mixing time. This contributes to overcoming challenges in obtaining
generalization guarantees for reinforcement learning, where the sequential
nature of data breaks the independence assumptions underlying classical bounds.
Our bound provides non-vacuous certificates for modern off-policy algorithms
like Soft Actor-Critic. We demonstrate the bound's practical utility through
PB-SAC, a novel algorithm that optimizes the bound during training to guide
exploration. Experiments across continuous control tasks show that our approach
provides meaningful confidence certificates while maintaining competitive
performance.

Conclusion: MFAM为帕金森病严重程度的自动化评估提供了有前景的解决方案，能够处理具有特异性的复杂临床时间序列

Abstract: Severity assessment of Parkinson's disease (PD) using wearable sensors offers
an effective, objective basis for clinical management. However, general-purpose
time series models often lack pathological specificity in feature extraction,
making it difficult to capture subtle signals highly correlated with
PD.Furthermore, the temporal sparsity of PD symptoms causes key diagnostic
features to be easily "diluted" by traditional aggregation methods, further
complicating assessment. To address these issues, we propose the Multi-scale
Frequency-Aware Adversarial Multi-Instance Network (MFAM). This model enhances
feature specificity through a frequency decomposition module guided by medical
prior knowledge. Furthermore, by introducing an attention-based multi-instance
learning (MIL) framework, the model can adaptively focus on the most
diagnostically valuable sparse segments.We comprehensively validated MFAM on
both the public PADS dataset for PD versus differential diagnosis (DD) binary
classification and a private dataset for four-class severity assessment.
Experimental results demonstrate that MFAM outperforms general-purpose time
series models in handling complex clinical time series with specificity,
providing a promising solution for automated assessment of PD severity.

Abstract: Classical consensus-based strategies for federated and decentralized learning
are statistically suboptimal in the presence of heterogeneous local data or
task distributions. As a result, in recent years, there has been growing
interest in multitask or personalized strategies, which allow individual agents
to benefit from one another in pursuing locally optimal models without
enforcing consensus. Existing strategies require either precise prior knowledge
of the underlying task relationships or are fully non-parametric and instead
rely on meta-learning or proximal constructions. In this work, we introduce an
algorithmic framework that strikes a balance between these extremes. By
modeling task relationships through a Gaussian Markov Random Field with an
unknown precision matrix, we develop a strategy that jointly learns both the
task relationships and the local models, allowing agents to self-organize in a
way consistent with their individual data distributions. Our theoretical
analysis quantifies the quality of the learned relationship, and our numerical
experiments demonstrate its practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning has achieved impressive empirical
success, yet its theoretical understanding remains limited. In this work, we
provide a theoretical perspective by formulating self-supervised representation
learning as an approximation to supervised representation learning objectives.
Based on this formulation, we derive a loss function closely related to popular
contrastive losses such as InfoNCE, offering insight into their underlying
principles. Our derivation naturally introduces the concepts of prototype
representation bias and a balanced contrastive loss, which help explain and
improve the behavior of self-supervised learning algorithms. We further show

### [579] [Compositional Symmetry as Compression: Lie Pseudogroup Structure in Algorithmic Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10586)
*Giulio Ruffini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于组合对称性的框架，将智能体建模为与感官流耦合的神经动力系统，展示了准确的世界跟踪如何施加结构和动力学约束，并提供了深度模型中组合性优势的几何解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从算法（Kolmogorov）视角出发，研究智能体如何通过生成程序来跟踪和压缩感官流，探索自然流的结构先验——组合对称性，以及这种对称性如何约束智能体的结构和动力学。

Method: 将智能体建模为与感官流耦合的通用神经动力系统，分析世界跟踪的准确性如何施加结构约束（智能体构成方程和读出的等变性）和动力学约束（对称性诱导守恒量和低维不变流形）。

Result: 证明了对称性在静态输入下诱导守恒量并约束轨迹到低维不变流形，在缓慢漂移下这些流形保持低维性，形成了与伪群组合分解对齐的层次化简化流形结构。

Conclusion: 该框架为深度模型中的组合性优势提供了几何解释，并提出了基于对称性的自包含预测编码版本，其中高层仅接收沿对称方向的粗粒度残差变换。

Abstract: In the algorithmic (Kolmogorov) view, agents are programs that track and
compress sensory streams using generative programs. We propose a framework
where the relevant structural prior is simplicity (Solomonoff) understood as
\emph{compositional symmetry}: natural streams are well described by (local)
actions of finite-parameter Lie pseudogroups on geometrically and topologically
complex low-dimensional configuration manifolds (latent spaces). Modeling the
agent as a generic neural dynamical system coupled to such streams, we show
that accurate world-tracking imposes (i) \emph{structural constraints} --
equivariance of the agent's constitutive equations and readouts -- and (ii)
\emph{dynamical constraints}: under static inputs, symmetry induces conserved
quantities (Noether-style labels) in the agent dynamics and confines
trajectories to reduced invariant manifolds; under slow drift, these manifolds
move but remain low-dimensional. This yields a hierarchy of reduced manifolds
aligned with the compositional factorization of the pseudogroup, providing a
geometric account of the ``blessing of compositionality'' in deep models. We
connect these ideas to the Spencer formalism for Lie pseudogroups and formulate
a symmetry-based, self-contained version of predictive coding in which higher
layers receive only \emph{coarse-grained residual transformations}
(prediction-error coordinates) along symmetry directions unresolved at lower
layers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑机接口面临EEG数据稀缺和显著的个体间差异问题，这限制了EEG解码模型在实际应用中的泛化能力和适用性。

Method: 提出FusionGen框架，基于解耦表示学习和特征融合，通过特征匹配融合模块整合跨试验特征，结合轻量级特征提取和重建流程。

Result: 在多个公开EEG数据集上的广泛实验表明，FusionGen显著优于现有增强技术，在分类准确率上取得了明显提升。

Conclusion: FusionGen通过有效的数据生成方法解决了EEG数据稀缺问题，为脑机接口的实际应用提供了更好的数据支持。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide potential for applications ranging
from medical rehabilitation to cognitive state assessment by establishing
direct communication pathways between the brain and external devices via
electroencephalography (EEG). However, EEG-based BCIs are severely constrained
by data scarcity and significant inter-subject variability, which hinder the
generalization and applicability of EEG decoding models in practical settings.
To address these challenges, we propose FusionGen, a novel EEG data generation
framework based on disentangled representation learning and feature fusion. By
integrating features across trials through a feature matching fusion module and
combining them with a lightweight feature extraction and reconstruction
pipeline, FusionGen ensures both data diversity and trainability under limited
data constraints. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available EEG
datasets demonstrate that FusionGen significantly outperforms existing
augmentation techniques, yielding notable improvements in classification
accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个在有限预算下优化探索中间模型空间的问题，将其形式化为Lipschitz空间内未知价值函数的预算分配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建学习模型通常需要评估大量中间模型，这些评估结果会影响后续的模型探索决策，但真实性能只有在评估后才能得知。

Method: 将问题形式化为Lipschitz空间内未知价值函数的一般预算分配问题。

Result: 提出了一个理论框架来优化有限预算下的模型探索策略。

Conclusion: 该工作为解决中间模型评估的预算分配问题提供了理论基础和形式化方法。

Abstract: Building learning models frequently requires evaluating numerous intermediate
models. Examples include models considered during feature selection, model
structure search, and parameter tunings. The evaluation of an intermediate
model influences subsequent model exploration decisions. Although prior
knowledge can provide initial quality estimates, true performance is only
revealed after evaluation. In this work, we address the challenge of optimally
allocating a bounded budget to explore the space of intermediate models. We
formalize this as a general budget allocation problem over unknown-value
functions within a Lipschitz space.

Motivation: 股票价格预测具有挑战性，传统GAN在金融领域应用受限，存在模式崩溃、训练不稳定、难以捕捉时空相关性等问题。

Method: 使用GRU编码器-解码器框架，包含残差连接的时间解码器、静态和动态协变量条件化、窗口机制捕捉时间动态。

Conclusion: EDGAN在表达能力和简单性之间取得了良好平衡，在股票预测任务中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Forecasting stock prices remains challenging due to the volatile and
non-linear nature of financial markets. Despite the promise of deep learning,
issues such as mode collapse, unstable training, and difficulty in capturing
temporal and feature level correlations have limited the applications of GANs
in this domain. We propose a GRU-based Encoder-Decoder GAN (EDGAN) model that
strikes a balance between expressive power and simplicity. The model introduces
key innovations such as a temporal decoder with residual connections for
precise reconstruction, conditioning on static and dynamic covariates for
contextual learning, and a windowing mechanism to capture temporal dynamics.
Here, the generator uses a dense encoder-decoder framework with residual GRU
blocks. Extensive experiments on diverse stock datasets demonstrate that EDGAN
achieves superior forecasting accuracy and training stability, even in volatile
markets. It consistently outperforms traditional GAN variants in forecasting
accuracy and convergence stability under market conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 锂离子电池容量随充放电循环次数增加而下降，威胁储能耐久性。现有方法对每个循环中电池状态信息的利用不足，需要更准确的容量预测来确保系统效率和可靠性。

Method: 提出SDG-L框架，结合LSTM特征提取器，专门设计用于更好地利用充放电过程中的辅助剖面信息，基于时间序列电池状态数据进行建模预测。

Conclusion: SDG-L框架能够有效利用电池状态信息进行容量预测，为锂离子电池储能系统的效率和可靠性提供支持。

Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries are becoming increasingly omnipresent in energy supply.
However, the durability of energy storage using lithium-ion batteries is
threatened by their dropping capacity with the growing number of
charging/discharging cycles. An accurate capacity prediction is the key to
ensure system efficiency and reliability, where the exploitation of battery
state information in each cycle has been largely undervalued. In this paper, we
propose a semiparametric deep Gaussian process regression framework named SDG-L
to give predictions based on the modeling of time series battery state data. By
introducing an LSTM feature extractor, the SDG-L is specially designed to
better utilize the auxiliary profiling information during charging/discharging
process. In experimental studies based on NASA dataset, our proposed method
obtains an average test MSE error of 1.2%. We also show that SDG-L achieves
better performance compared to existing works and validate the framework using
ablation studies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ImpMIA是一种基于神经网络隐式偏置的白盒成员推理攻击方法，通过KKT最优性条件识别训练样本，无需依赖参考模型和传统黑盒攻击的不现实假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统黑盒成员推理攻击依赖不现实的假设：攻击者知道训练超参数、非训练样本与训练数据同分布、评估集中训练数据比例已知。这些假设在实际场景中很少成立，导致攻击性能显著下降。

Method: 利用神经网络的最大间隔隐式偏置理论，通过Karush-Kuhn-Tucker(KKT)最优性条件识别训练样本，找到梯度最能重构模型参数的样本。

Result: 在仅提供模型权重和训练数据超集的现实场景下，ImpMIA相比黑盒和白盒攻击方法都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ImpMIA通过利用神经网络的隐式偏置，摆脱了对参考模型和不现实假设的依赖，在现实场景中实现了更有效的成员推理攻击。

Abstract: Determining which data samples were used to train a model-known as Membership
Inference Attack (MIA)-is a well-studied and important problem with
implications for data privacy. Black-box methods presume access only to the
model's outputs and often rely on training auxiliary reference models. While
they have shown strong empirical performance, they rely on assumptions that
rarely hold in real-world settings: (i) the attacker knows the training
hyperparameters; (ii) all available non-training samples come from the same
distribution as the training data; and (iii) the fraction of training data in
the evaluation set is known. In this paper, we demonstrate that removing these
assumptions leads to a significant drop in the performance of black-box
attacks. We introduce ImpMIA, a Membership Inference Attack that exploits the
Implicit Bias of neural networks, hence removes the need to rely on any
reference models and their assumptions. ImpMIA is a white-box attack -- a
setting which assumes access to model weights and is becoming increasingly
realistic given that many models are publicly available (e.g., via Hugging
Face). Building on maximum-margin implicit bias theory, ImpMIA uses the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions to identify training samples.
This is done by finding the samples whose gradients most strongly reconstruct
the trained model's parameters. As a result, ImpMIA achieves state-of-the-art
performance compared to both black and white box attacks in realistic settings
where only the model weights and a superset of the training data are available.

Motivation: 当前蛋白质结构表示方法面临SE(3)流形复杂性、离散标记化或需要多个训练目标的问题，这些都阻碍了模型优化和泛化能力。

Method: 使用具有瓶颈设计的非等变扩散变换器进行高效压缩，通过单一流匹配目标进行端到端训练。

Result: ProteinAE实现了最先进的重建质量，优于现有自编码器，其潜在空间为潜在扩散模型提供了强大基础，无需显式等变性即可实现高效高质量的结构生成。

Conclusion: ProteinAE通过简化的优化流程和紧凑的潜在表示，为蛋白质生成建模提供了有效的解决方案，在结构重建和生成方面表现出色。

Abstract: Developing effective representations of protein structures is essential for
advancing protein science, particularly for protein generative modeling.
Current approaches often grapple with the complexities of the SE(3) manifold,
rely on discrete tokenization, or the need for multiple training objectives,
all of which can hinder the model optimization and generalization. We introduce
ProteinAE, a novel and streamlined protein diffusion autoencoder designed to
overcome these challenges by directly mapping protein backbone coordinates from
E(3) into a continuous, compact latent space. ProteinAE employs a
non-equivariant Diffusion Transformer with a bottleneck design for efficient
compression and is trained end-to-end with a single flow matching objective,
substantially simplifying the optimization pipeline. We demonstrate that
ProteinAE achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, outperforming
existing autoencoders. The resulting latent space serves as a powerful
foundation for a latent diffusion model that bypasses the need for explicit
equivariance. This enables efficient, high-quality structure generation that is
competitive with leading structure-based approaches and significantly
outperforms prior latent-based methods. Code is available at

Abstract: Retrosynthesis is one of the domains transformed by the rise of generative
models, and it is one where the problem of nonsensical or erroneous outputs
(hallucinations) is particularly insidious: reliable assessment of synthetic
plans is time-consuming, with automatic methods lacking. In this work, we
present RetroTrim, a retrosynthesis system that successfully avoids nonsensical
plans on a set of challenging drug-like targets. Compared to common baselines
in the field, our system is not only the sole method that succeeds in filtering
out hallucinated reactions, but it also results in the highest number of
high-quality paths overall. The key insight behind RetroTrim is the combination
of diverse reaction scoring strategies, based on machine learning models and
existing chemical databases. We show that our scoring strategies capture
different classes of hallucinations by analyzing them on a dataset of labeled
retrosynthetic intermediates. To measure the performance of retrosynthesis
systems, we propose a novel evaluation protocol for reactions and synthetic
paths based on a structured review by expert chemists. Using this protocol, we
compare systems on a set of 32 novel targets, curated to reflect recent trends
in drug structures. While the insights behind our methodology are broadly
applicable to retrosynthesis, our focus is on targets in the drug-like domain.
By releasing our benchmark targets and the details of our evaluation protocol,
we hope to inspire further research into reliable retrosynthesis.

Abstract: Control Co-Design (CCD) integrates physical and control system design to
improve the performance of dynamic and autonomous systems. Despite advances in
uncertainty-aware CCD methods, real-world uncertainties remain highly
unpredictable. Multi-generation design addresses this challenge by considering
the full lifecycle of a product: data collected from each generation informs
the design of subsequent generations, enabling progressive improvements in
robustness and efficiency. Digital Twin (DT) technology further strengthens
this paradigm by creating virtual representations that evolve over the
lifecycle through real-time sensing, model updating, and adaptive
re-optimization. This paper presents a DT-enabled CCD framework that integrates
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to jointly optimize physical design and
controller. DRL accelerates real-time decision-making by allowing controllers
to continuously learn from data and adapt to uncertain environments. Extending
this approach, the framework employs a multi-generation paradigm, where each
cycle of deployment, operation, and redesign uses collected data to refine DT
models, improve uncertainty quantification through quantile regression, and
inform next-generation designs of both physical components and controllers. The
framework is demonstrated on an active suspension system, where DT-enabled
learning from road conditions and driving behaviors yields smoother and more
stable control trajectories. Results show that the method significantly
enhances dynamic performance, robustness, and efficiency. Contributions of this
work include: (1) extending CCD into a lifecycle-oriented multi-generation
framework, (2) leveraging DTs for continuous model updating and informed
design, and (3) employing DRL to accelerate adaptive real-time decision-making.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of inter-stock relationships is critical for stock price
forecasting. However, existing methods predominantly focus on single-state
relationships, neglecting the essential complementarity between dynamic and
static inter-stock relations. To solve this problem, we propose a Dual Relation
Fusion Network (DRFN) to capture the long-term relative stability of stock
relation structures while retaining the flexibility to respond to sudden market
shifts. Our approach features a novel relative static relation component that
models time-varying long-term patterns and incorporates overnight informational
influences. We capture dynamic inter-stock relationships through distance-aware
mechanisms, while evolving long-term structures via recurrent fusion of dynamic
relations from the prior day with the pre-defined static relations. Experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the baselines across
different markets, with high sensitivity to the co-movement of relational
strength and stock price.

Abstract: Accurate climate forecasting is vital for Bangladesh, a region highly
susceptible to climate change impacts on temperature and rainfall. Existing
models often struggle to capture long-range dependencies and complex temporal
patterns in climate data. This study introduces an advanced Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) model integrated with an attention mechanism to enhance the
prediction of temperature and rainfall dynamics. Utilizing comprehensive
datasets from 1901-2023, sourced from NASA's POWER Project for temperature and
the Humanitarian Data Exchange for rainfall, the model effectively captures
seasonal and long-term trends. It outperforms baseline models, including
XGBoost, Simple LSTM, and GRU, achieving a test MSE of 0.2411 (normalized
units), MAE of 0.3860 degrees C, R^2 of 0.9834, and NRMSE of 0.0370 for
temperature, and MSE of 1283.67 mm^2, MAE of 22.91 mm, R^2 of 0.9639, and NRMSE
of 0.0354 for rainfall on monthly forecasts. The model demonstrates improved
robustness with only a 20 percent increase in MSE under simulated climate
trends (compared to an approximately 2.2-fold increase in baseline models
without trend features) and a 50 percent degradation under regional variations
(compared to an approximately 4.8-fold increase in baseline models without
enhancements). These results highlight the model's ability to improve
forecasting precision and offer potential insights into the physical processes
governing climate variability in Bangladesh, supporting applications in
climate-sensitive sectors.

Abstract: The generation of trees with a specified tree edit distance has significant
applications across various fields, including computational biology, structured
data analysis, and image processing. Recently, generative networks have been
increasingly employed to synthesize new data that closely resembles the
original datasets. However, the appropriate size and depth of generative
networks required to generate data with a specified tree edit distance remain
unclear. In this paper, we theoretically establish the existence and
construction of generative networks capable of producing trees similar to a
given tree with respect to the tree edit distance. Specifically, for a given
rooted, ordered, and vertex-labeled tree T of size n + 1 with labels from an
alphabet \Sigma, and a non-negative integer d, we prove that all rooted,
ordered, and vertex-labeled trees over \Sigma with tree edit distance at most d
from T can be generated using a ReLU-based generative network with size O(n^3 )
and constant depth. The proposed networks were implemented and evaluated for
generating trees with up to 21 nodes. Due to their deterministic architecture,
the networks successfully generated all valid trees within the specified tree
edit distance. In contrast, state-of-the-art graph generative models GraphRNN
and GraphGDP, which rely on non-deterministic mechanisms, produced
significantly fewer valid trees, achieving validation rates of only up to 35%
and 48%, respectively. These findings provide a theoretical foundation towards
construction of compact generative models and open new directions for exact and
valid tree-structured data generation. An implementation of the proposed
networks is available at https://github.com/MGANN-KU/TreeGen_ReLUNetworks.

Abstract: We provide a unified algorithmic framework for ensemble sampling in nonlinear
contextual bandits and develop corresponding regret bounds for two most common
nonlinear contextual bandit settings: Generalized Linear Ensemble Sampling
(\texttt{GLM-ES}) for generalized linear bandits and Neural Ensemble Sampling
(\texttt{Neural-ES}) for neural contextual bandits. Both methods maintain
multiple estimators for the reward model parameters via maximum likelihood
estimation on randomly perturbed data. We prove high-probability frequentist
regret bounds of $\mathcal{O}(d^{3/2} \sqrt{T} + d^{9/2})$ for \texttt{GLM-ES}
and $\mathcal{O}(\widetilde{d} \sqrt{T})$ for \texttt{Neural-ES}, where $d$ is
the dimension of feature vectors, $\widetilde{d}$ is the effective dimension of
a neural tangent kernel matrix, and $T$ is the number of rounds. These regret
bounds match the state-of-the-art results of randomized exploration algorithms
in nonlinear contextual bandit settings. In the theoretical analysis, we
introduce techniques that address challenges specific to nonlinear models.
Practically, we remove fixed-time horizon assumptions by developing anytime
versions of our algorithms, suitable when $T$ is unknown. Finally, we
empirically evaluate \texttt{GLM-ES}, \texttt{Neural-ES}, and their anytime
variants, demonstrating strong performance. Overall, our results establish
ensemble sampling as a provable and practical randomized exploration approach

*Shaharyar Ahmed Khan Tareen,Filza Khan Tareen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了优化深度网络（ODNs）方法，通过渐进深度扩展训练策略，为不同复杂度数据集找到最优网络深度，大幅减少模型大小和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在获得优异性能的同时，往往存在模型过大、计算需求高、内存占用大的问题，特别是在处理相对简单数据集时会造成资源浪费，难以在资源受限设备上部署。

Method: 采用类似神经架构搜索的训练策略——渐进深度扩展，从较浅深度开始训练，随着早期模块收敛逐步增加网络深度，直到达到目标精度，最终移除冗余层。

Result: 在MNIST和SVHN数据集上，ResNet-18和ResNet-34的最优深度分别实现了98.64%和96.44%的内存占用减少，同时保持了99.31%和96.08%的竞争性准确率。

Conclusion: ODNs方法能够根据数据集复杂度自动确定最优网络深度，显著降低训练和推理成本，提高计算效率，便于在边缘设备上部署。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have provided brilliant performance across
various tasks. However, this success often comes at the cost of unnecessarily
large model sizes, high computational demands, and substantial memory
footprints. Typically, powerful architectures are trained at full depths but
not all datasets or tasks require such high model capacity. Training very deep
architectures on relatively low-complexity datasets frequently leads to wasted
computation, unnecessary energy consumption, and excessive memory usage, which
in turn makes deployment of models on resource-constrained devices impractical.
To address this problem, we introduce Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs), which
provide a balance between model depth and task complexity. Specifically, we
propose a NAS like training strategy called progressive depth expansion, which
begins by training deep networks at shallower depths and incrementally
increases their depth as the earlier blocks converge, continuing this process
until the target accuracy is reached. ODNs use only the optimal depth for the
given datasets, removing redundant layers. This cuts down future training and
inference costs, lowers the memory footprint, enhances computational
efficiency, and facilitates deployment on edge devices. Empirical results show
that the optimal depths of ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 for MNIST and SVHN, achieve
up to 98.64 % and 96.44 % reduction in memory footprint, while maintaining a
competitive accuracy of 99.31 % and 96.08 %, respectively.

TL;DR: 本文分析了RLHF微调扩散模型时训练与推理采样器不匹配导致的奖励差距问题，提供了理论界限并通过实验验证高随机性SDE训练能缩小奖励差距并提升ODE采样质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RLHF微调扩散模型时训练使用的随机SDE采样器与推理使用的确定性ODE采样器之间的不匹配问题，这种差异会导致奖励差距，影响推理时输出质量。

Method: 采用广义去噪扩散隐式模型(gDDIM)框架支持任意高随机性，保持数据边际分布；通过理论分析奖励差距并提供非空界限；使用DDPO和MixGRPO方法在文本到图像模型上进行大规模实验验证。

Result: 理论分析表明奖励差距有非空界限，VE和VP高斯模型有更快的收敛率；实验验证奖励差距在训练过程中持续缩小，使用更高随机性的SDE训练能提升ODE采样质量。

Conclusion: 训练与推理采样器不匹配导致的奖励差距问题可以通过理论分析和实验验证得到解决，高随机性SDE训练能有效缩小奖励差距并提升推理时ODE采样的输出质量。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly used to
fine-tune diffusion models, but a key challenge arises from the mismatch
between stochastic samplers used during training and deterministic samplers
used during inference. In practice, models are fine-tuned using stochastic SDE
samplers to encourage exploration, while inference typically relies on
deterministic ODE samplers for efficiency and stability. This discrepancy
induces a reward gap, raising concerns about whether high-quality outputs can
be expected during inference. In this paper, we theoretically characterize this
reward gap and provide non-vacuous bounds for general diffusion models, along
with sharper convergence rates for Variance Exploding (VE) and Variance
Preserving (VP) Gaussian models. Methodologically, we adopt the generalized
denoising diffusion implicit models (gDDIM) framework to support arbitrarily
high levels of stochasticity, preserving data marginals throughout.
Empirically, our findings through large-scale experiments on text-to-image
models using denoising diffusion policy optimization (DDPO) and mixed group
relative policy optimization (MixGRPO) validate that reward gaps consistently
narrow over training, and ODE sampling quality improves when models are updated
using higher-stochasticity SDE training.

Result: 在公开数据集上，OmniGNN超越了现有股票预测模型，在COVID-19期间表现出特别强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: OmniGNN通过创新的全局中介节点设计，有效解决了宏观经济冲击下的消息传播问题，为金融市场的图神经网络应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: In financial markets, Graph Neural Networks have been successfully applied to
modeling relational data, effectively capturing nonlinear inter-stock
dependencies. Yet, existing models often fail to efficiently propagate messages
during macroeconomic shocks. In this paper, we propose OmniGNN, an
attention-based multi-relational dynamic GNN that integrates macroeconomic
context via heterogeneous node and edge types for robust message passing.
Central to OmniGNN is a sector node acting as a global intermediary, enabling
rapid shock propagation across the graph without relying on long-range
multi-hop diffusion. The model leverages Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to
weigh neighbor contributions and employs Transformers to capture temporal
dynamics across multiplex relations. Experiments show that OmniGNN outperforms
existing stock prediction models on public datasets, particularly demonstrating
strong robustness during the COVID-19 period.

Result: 实验表明新优化器与现有最先进方法具有竞争力，在某些情况下表现更优。

Conclusion: 该统一框架为理解各种优化器提供了新视角，提出的新方法在性能和适用性方面具有优势。

Abstract: Optimization lies at the core of modern deep learning, yet existing methods
often face a fundamental trade-off between adapting to problem geometry and
leveraging curvature utilization. Steepest descent algorithms adapt to
different geometries through norm choices but remain strictly first-order,
whereas quasi-Newton and adaptive optimizers incorporate curvature information
but are restricted to Frobenius geometry, limiting their applicability across
diverse architectures. In this work, we propose a unified framework
generalizing steepest descent, quasi-Newton methods, and adaptive methods
through the novel notion of preconditioned matrix norms. This abstraction
reveals that widely used optimizers such as SGD and Adam, as well as more
advanced approaches like Muon and KL-Shampoo, and recent hybrids including SOAP
and SPlus, all emerge as special cases of the same principle. Within this
framework, we provide the first systematic treatment of affine and scale
invariance in the matrix-parameterized setting, establishing necessary and
sufficient conditions under generalized norms. Building on this foundation, we
introduce two new methods, $\texttt{MuAdam}$ and $\texttt{MuAdam-SANIA}$, which
combine the spectral geometry of Muon with Adam-style preconditioning. Our
experiments demonstrate that these optimizers are competitive with, and in some
cases outperform, existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at

Motivation: 当前深度学习架构基于感知器模型，无法捕捉生物神经元的振荡动态特性。虽然振荡系统更接近神经行为，但仍难以模拟自然神经回路中复杂的时空相互作用。

Method: BioOSS包含两个相互作用的神经元群体：p神经元模拟皮层柱中锥体细胞的膜电位样单元，o神经元控制传播速度并调节活动的横向扩散。通过局部相互作用产生波状传播模式，包含可训练的参数用于阻尼和传播速度。

Conclusion: BioOSS能够有效模拟前额叶皮层中复杂的活动模式，为神经处理提供更生物逼真的建模方法，在性能和可解释性方面均优于现有替代架构。

Abstract: Today's deep learning architectures are primarily based on perceptron models,
which do not capture the oscillatory dynamics characteristic of biological
neurons. Although oscillatory systems have recently gained attention for their
closer resemblance to neural behavior, they still fall short of modeling the
intricate spatio-temporal interactions observed in natural neural circuits. In
this paper, we propose a bio-inspired oscillatory state system (BioOSS)
designed to emulate the wave-like propagation dynamics critical to neural
processing, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), where complex activity
patterns emerge. BioOSS comprises two interacting populations of neurons: p
neurons, which represent simplified membrane-potential-like units inspired by
pyramidal cells in cortical columns, and o neurons, which govern propagation
velocities and modulate the lateral spread of activity. Through local
interactions, these neurons produce wave-like propagation patterns. The model
incorporates trainable parameters for damping and propagation speed, enabling
flexible adaptation to task-specific spatio-temporal structures. We evaluate
BioOSS on both synthetic and real-world tasks, demonstrating superior
performance and enhanced interpretability compared to alternative
architectures.

Result: 线性回归表现稳健，优于更复杂的LSTM和时序融合Transformer模型。

Conclusion: 在开发和评估深度学习模型时，必须包含传统统计模型作为基准，并建立能捕捉自然变异和人类干预综合影响的全球代表性基准数据集。

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
models and Transformers have been widely adopted in hydrological applications,
demonstrating impressive performance amongst deep learning models and
outperforming physical models in various tasks. However, their superiority in
predicting land surface states such as terrestrial water storage (TWS) that are
dominated by many factors such as natural variability and human driven
modifications remains unclear. Here, using the open-access, globally
representative HydroGlobe dataset - comprising a baseline version derived
solely from a land surface model simulation and an advanced version
incorporating multi-source remote sensing data assimilation - we show that
linear regression is a robust benchmark, outperforming the more complex LSTM
and Temporal Fusion Transformer for TWS prediction. Our findings highlight the
importance of including traditional statistical models as benchmarks when
developing and evaluating deep learning models. Additionally, we emphasize the
critical need to establish globally representative benchmark datasets that
capture the combined impact of natural variability and human interventions.

Conclusion: 剪枝作为开发能够简化时空问题模型的有效工具，具有识别问题最重要元素的潜力。

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of using a deep learning model to prune
graphs and the ability of this method to integrate explainability into
spatio-temporal problems through a new approach. Instead of applying
explainability to the model's behavior, we seek to gain a better understanding
of the problem itself. To this end, we propose a novel model that integrates an
optimized pruning mechanism capable of removing nodes from the graph during the
training process, rather than doing so as a separate procedure. This
integration allows the architecture to learn how to minimize prediction error
while selecting the most relevant nodes. Thus, during training, the model
searches for the most relevant subset of nodes, obtaining the most important
elements of the problem, facilitating its analysis. To evaluate the proposed
approach, we used several widely used traffic datasets, comparing the accuracy
obtained by pruning with the model and with other methods. The experiments
demonstrate that our method is capable of retaining a greater amount of
information as the graph reduces in size compared to the other methods used.
These results highlight the potential of pruning as a tool for developing
models capable of simplifying spatio-temporal problems, thereby obtaining their
most important elements.

TL;DR: MARCD是一个结合制度条件生成场景和CVaR分配器的投资组合决策框架，通过隐马尔可夫模型推断潜在制度，使用尾部加权扩散模型生成危机场景，在严格的前向测试中显著改善了回撤控制和夏普比率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究制度转换环境下如何通过制度条件生成场景和凸CVaR分配器来改进投资组合决策，特别是在危机期间改善尾部风险建模和回撤控制。

Method: 提出MARCD方法：1) 使用高斯HMM推断潜在制度；2) 训练具有尾部加权目标和制度专业化混合专家去噪器的扩散模型；3) 将生成场景输入考虑换手率的CVaR二次规划分配器。

Result: 在2005-2025年流动性多资产ETF的严格前向测试中，MARCD显著优于标准分配器，2020-2025年样本外表现：夏普比率1.23（基准1.02），最大回撤9.3%（基准14.1%），回撤减少34%，夏普提升在5%水平显著。

Conclusion: MARCD提供了一个从尾部忠实场景建模到受治理投资组合决策的可复现桥梁，显著改善了回撤控制，并提供了理论保证包括尾部加权扩散与CVaR差距的光谱风险控制、制度-MoE去噪器的oracle/一致性结果，以及分配器的Lipschitz/遗憾保证。

Abstract: We study whether regime-conditioned generative scenarios, coupled with a
convex CVaR allocator, improve portfolio decisions under regime shifts. We
introduce Multi-Agent Regime-Conditioned Diffusion (MARCD), which (i) infers
latent regimes via a Gaussian HMM, (ii) trains a diffusion model with a
tail-weighted objective and a regime-specialized mixture-of-experts (MoE)
denoiser to enrich crisis co-movements, and (iii) feeds the generated scenarios
into a turnover-aware CVaR epigraph quadratic program with explicit governance.
In strict walk-forward tests on liquid multi-asset ETFs (2005-2025), MARCD
outperforms standard allocators and improves calibration relative to popular
generators. Over 2020-2025 out-of-sample (monthly; 10 bps), MARCD attains
Sharpe 1.23 (BL 1.02) and MaxDD 9.3 percent (BL 14.1 percent), a 34 percent
reduction, at comparable turnover; stationary block-bootstrap intervals
indicate the Sharpe uplift is significant at 5 percent. We provide theory
linking tail-weighted diffusion to spectral-risk control of the
decision-relevant CVaR gap, oracle/consistency results for the regime-MoE
denoiser, and Lipschitz/regret guarantees for the allocator. Together, MARCD
offers a reproducible bridge from tail-faithful scenario modeling to governed
portfolio decisions with materially improved drawdown control.

Conclusion: AEGIS框架能够高效识别最优掩码配置，在保护隐私的同时保持数据效用，适用于原始数据因隐私限制而无法访问的场景。

Abstract: Data-sharing ecosystems enable entities -- such as providers, consumers, and
intermediaries -- to access, exchange, and utilize data for various downstream
tasks and applications. Due to privacy concerns, data providers typically
anonymize datasets before sharing them; however, the existence of multiple
masking configurations results in masked datasets with varying utility.
Consequently, a key challenge lies in efficiently determining the optimal
masking configuration that maximizes a dataset's utility. This paper presents
AEGIS, a middleware framework for identifying the optimal masking configuration
for machine learning datasets that consist of features and a class label. We
introduce a utility optimizer that minimizes predictive utility deviation -- a
metric based on the changes in feature-label correlations before and after
masking. Our framework leverages limited data summaries (such as 1D histograms)
or none to estimate the feature-label joint distribution, making it suitable
for scenarios where raw data is inaccessible due to privacy restrictions. To
achieve this, we propose a joint distribution estimator based on iterative
proportional fitting, which allows supporting various feature-label correlation
quantification methods such as g3, mutual information, or chi-square. Our
experimental evaluation on real-world datasets shows that AEGIS identifies
optimal masking configurations over an order of magnitude faster, while the
resulting masked datasets achieve predictive performance on downstream ML tasks
that is on par with baseline approaches.

Conclusion: 研究强调了自适应、节点感知的GNN-LLM架构的价值，选择性调用LLM能够在大型图上实现可扩展部署，而不会产生高计算成本

Abstract: Learning on text-attributed graphs has motivated the use of Large Language
Models (LLMs) for graph learning. However, most fusion strategies are applied
uniformly across all nodes and attain only small overall performance gains. We
argue this result stems from aggregate metrics that obscure when LLMs provide
benefit, inhibiting actionable signals for new strategies. In this work, we
reframe LLM-GNN fusion around nodes where GNNs typically falter. We first show
that performance can significantly differ between GNNs and LLMs, with each
excelling on distinct structural patterns, such as local homophily. To leverage
this finding, we propose GLANCE (GNN with LLM Assistance for Neighbor- and
Context-aware Embeddings), a framework that invokes an LLM to refine a GNN's
prediction. GLANCE employs a lightweight router that, given inexpensive
per-node signals, decides whether to query the LLM. Since the LLM calls are
non-differentiable, the router is trained with an advantage-based objective
that compares the utility of querying the LLM against relying solely on the
GNN. Across multiple benchmarks, GLANCE achieves the best performance balance
across node subgroups, achieving significant gains on heterophilous nodes (up
to $+13\%$) while simultaneously achieving top overall performance. Our
findings highlight the value of adaptive, node-aware GNN-LLM architectures,
where selectively invoking the LLM enables scalable deployment on large graphs
without incurring high computational costs.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in generating
high-dimensional samples across domains such as vision, language, and the
sciences. Although continuous-state diffusion models have been extensively
studied both empirically and theoretically, discrete-state diffusion models,
essential for applications involving text, sequences, and combinatorial
structures, remain significantly less understood from a theoretical standpoint.
In particular, all existing analyses of discrete-state models assume score
estimation error bounds without studying sample complexity results. In this
work, we present a principled theoretical framework for discrete-state
diffusion, providing the first sample complexity bound of
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$. Our structured decomposition of the
score estimation error into statistical, approximation, optimization, and
clipping components offers critical insights into how discrete-state models can
be trained efficiently. This analysis addresses a fundamental gap in the
literature and establishes the theoretical tractability and practical relevance
of discrete-state diffusion models.

Abstract: Several learned policies have been proposed to replace heuristics for
scheduling, caching, and other system components in modern systems. By
leveraging diverse features, learning from historical trends, and predicting
future behaviors, such models promise to keep pace with ever-increasing
workload dynamism and continuous hardware evolution. However, policies trained
in isolation may still achieve suboptimal performance when placed together. In
this paper, we inspect one such instance in the domain of hardware caching --
for the policies of cache replacement and prefetching. We argue that these two
policies are bidirectionally interdependent and make the case for training the
two jointly. We propose a joint learning approach based on developing shared
representations for the features used by the two policies. We present two
approaches to develop these shared representations, one based on a joint
encoder and another based on contrastive learning of the embeddings, and
demonstrate promising preliminary results for both of these. Finally, we lay
down an agenda for future research in this direction.

Abstract: Graph heterophily, where connected nodes have different labels, has attracted
significant interest recently. Most existing works adopt a simplified approach
- using low-pass filters for homophilic graphs and high-pass filters for
heterophilic graphs. However, we discover that the relationship between graph
heterophily and spectral filters is more complex - the optimal filter response
varies across frequency components and does not follow a strict monotonic
correlation with heterophily degree. This finding challenges conventional fixed
filter designs and suggests the need for adaptive filtering to preserve
expressiveness in graph embeddings. Formally, natural questions arise: Given a
heterophilic graph G, how and to what extent will the varying heterophily
degree of G affect the performance of GNNs? How can we design adaptive filters
to fit those varying heterophilic connections? Our theoretical analysis reveals
that the average frequency response of GNNs and graph heterophily degree do not
follow a strict monotonic correlation, necessitating adaptive graph filters to
guarantee good generalization performance. Hence, we propose [METHOD NAME], a
simple yet powerful GNN, which extracts information across the heterophily
spectrum and combines salient representations through adaptive mixing. [METHOD
NAME]'s superior performance achieves up to 9.2% accuracy improvement over
leading baselines across homophilic and heterophilic graphs.

Motivation: 发布机器学习模型时存在隐私泄露风险，需要一种原则性的方法来量化这种风险，因为直觉上发布模型应该比发布数据集风险小，但具体风险程度未知。

Method: 从发布学习模型的信息披露上限推导出梯度唯一性度量，该方法具有普适性，不依赖特定假设。还研究了基于监控梯度唯一性的简单防御方法。

Result: 基于梯度唯一性的防御方法在隐私保护方面与经典方法（如DP-SGD）相当，但在测试准确率（效用）方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 梯度唯一性提供了一种直观的隐私审计方法，其防御策略在平衡隐私和效用方面优于传统方法。

Abstract: Disclosing private information via publication of a machine learning model is
often a concern. Intuitively, publishing a learned model should be less risky
than publishing a dataset. But how much risk is there? In this paper, we
present a principled disclosure metric called \emph{gradient uniqueness} that
is derived from an upper bound on the amount of information disclosure from
publishing a learned model. Gradient uniqueness provides an intuitive way to
perform privacy auditing. The mathematical derivation of gradient uniqueness is
general, and does not make any assumption on the model architecture, dataset
type, or the strategy of an attacker. We examine a simple defense based on
monitoring gradient uniqueness, and find that it achieves privacy comparable to
classical methods such as DP-SGD, while being substantially better in terms of
(utility) testing accuracy.

*Hanchang Cheng,Weimin Mu,Fan Liu,Weilin Zhu,Can Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出LPCVAE方法，通过LSTM捕捉长期依赖关系，使用PoE机制进行概率性时频融合，有效解决传统VAE方法在时间序列异常检测中的单窗口特征和时频信息利用不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于VAE的时间序列异常检测方法存在单窗口特征限制，且未能充分利用长期时间和频率信息，限制了检测性能。

Method: 提出LPCVAE模型，引入LSTM捕捉长期依赖关系，采用Product-of-Experts机制进行自适应分布级概率融合，减少时频信息损失。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的广泛实验表明，LPCVAE优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 将长期时间和频率表示与自适应融合相结合，为时间序列异常检测提供了鲁棒且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection(TSAD) is a critical task in signal processing
field, ensuring the reliability of complex systems. Reconstruction-based
methods dominate in TSAD. Among these methods, VAE-based methods have achieved
promising results. Existing VAE-based methods suffer from the limitation of
single-window feature and insufficient leveraging of long-term time and
frequency information. We propose a Conditional Variational AutoEncoder with
Long-term dependency and Probabilistic time-frequency fusion, named LPCVAE.
LPCVAE introduces LSTM to capture long-term dependencies beyond windows. It
further incorporates a Product-of-Experts (PoE) mechanism for adaptive and
distribution-level probabilistic fusion. This design effectively mitigates
time-frequency information loss. Extensive experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate it outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The results confirm that
integrating long-term time and frequency representations with adaptive fusion
yields a robust and efficient solution for TSAD.

TL;DR: 提出PerSyn方法，通过"路由后生成"范式为每个学生模型定制合成数据，解决强模型不总是最优教师的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明强模型不总是最优教师，存在教师输出与学生可学习性不匹配的问题，需要更有效的数据合成策略。

Method: PerSyn采用"路由后生成"范式：首先通过考虑学生可学习性和教师响应质量的查询级路由器为每个提示分配最优教师，然后各教师仅为分配的提示生成数据。

Result: 在不同模型家族和规模的广泛实验中，PerSyn在指令调优和数学推理设置中始终优于或与所有基线方法相当。

Conclusion: PerSyn验证了其有效性，并提供了推动未来研究的额外见解。

Abstract: Training student models on synthetic data generated by strong teacher models
is a promising way to distilling the capabilities of teachers. However, recent
studies show that stronger models are not always optimal teachers, revealing a
mismatch between teacher outputs and student learnability. To address this
issue, we propose PerSyn (Personalized data Synthesis), a novel synthesis
strategy that operates under a new ``Route then Generate'' paradigm to create
data tailored to each student model, enabling it to learn more effectively.
Specifically, PerSyn first assigns each prompt to its optimal teacher via a
query-level router that jointly considers student learnability and teacher
response quality. Each teacher then synthesizes data only for its assigned
prompts, making the process more efficient than the conventional ``Generate
then Select'' paradigm, where all teachers must generate parallel responses for
the entire prompt set before constructing the final dataset. Extensive
experiments across different model families and scales demonstrate that PerSyn
consistently achieves superior or comparable performance to all baselines in
instruct tuning and math reasoning settings. Further analysis verifies the
effectiveness of PerSyn and offers extra insights to propel future research.

Result: 在SMAC和Highway-env平台上的实验结果表明，该方法能够在多参与方开放系统中发起通用且有效的对抗攻击。

Conclusion: 该方法为多参与方开放系统中的对抗攻击提供了可行的解决方案，克服了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been an important machine learning paradigm
for solving long-horizon sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty.
By integrating deep neural networks (DNNs) into the RL framework, deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged, which achieved significant success in
various domains. However, the integration of DNNs also makes it vulnerable to
adversarial attacks. Existing adversarial attack techniques mainly focus on
either directly manipulating the environment with which a victim agent
interacts or deploying an adversarial agent that interacts with the victim
agent to induce abnormal behaviors. While these techniques achieve promising
results, their adoption in multi-party open systems remains limited due to two
major reasons: impractical assumption of full control over the environment and
dependent on interactions with victim agents.
  To enable adversarial attacks in multi-party open systems, in this paper, we
redesigned an adversarial policy learning approach that can mislead
well-trained victim agents without requiring direct interactions with these
agents or full control over their environments. Particularly, we propose a
neutral agent-based approach across various task scenarios in multi-party open
systems. While the neutral agents seemingly are detached from the victim
agents, indirectly influence them through the shared environment. We evaluate
our proposed method on the SMAC platform based on Starcraft II and the
autonomous driving simulation platform Highway-env. The experimental results
demonstrate that our method can launch general and effective adversarial
attacks in multi-party open systems.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个理论框架，将经典信息论扩展到有限和结构化系统，将冗余重新定义为信息组织的基本属性而非低效性。该框架通过信息散度统一了多种经典度量，揭示了冗余的几何原理，并预测冗余存在上下界，形成最优平衡点。实验验证了在掩码自编码器中，模型在特定冗余水平下达到最佳泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统通信理论强调最小化冗余以提高传输效率，但现实世界中的有限和结构化系统（如机器学习）需要冗余来维持稳定性和泛化能力。作者旨在建立连接通信理论和学习理论的统一框架。

Method: 提出了一个理论框架，将冗余重新定义为信息组织的基本属性，通过信息散度家族统一多种经典度量（互信息、卡方依赖、谱冗余等），并建立冗余的几何原理。通过掩码自编码器实验验证理论预测。

Result: 理论框架揭示了传统信息度量是共享冗余几何的投影，预测冗余存在上下界形成最优平衡。实验显示掩码自编码器在特定冗余水平下达到最佳泛化性能，验证了理论预测。

Conclusion: 冗余是可测量和可调节的量，连接了通信的渐近世界和学习的有限世界。在有限结构化系统中，冗余的最优平衡点对稳定性和泛化能力至关重要。

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework that extends classical information theory
to finite and structured systems by redefining redundancy as a fundamental
property of information organization rather than inefficiency. In this
framework, redundancy is expressed as a general family of informational
divergences that unifies multiple classical measures, such as mutual
information, chi-squared dependence, and spectral redundancy, under a single
geometric principle. This reveals that these traditional quantities are not
isolated heuristics but projections of a shared redundancy geometry. The theory
further predicts that redundancy is bounded both above and below, giving rise
to an optimal equilibrium that balances over-compression (loss of structure)
and over-coupling (collapse). While classical communication theory favors
minimal redundancy for transmission efficiency, finite and structured systems,
such as those underlying real-world learning, achieve maximal stability and
generalization near this equilibrium. Experiments with masked autoencoders are
used to illustrate and verify this principle: the model exhibits a stable
redundancy level where generalization peaks. Together, these results establish
redundancy as a measurable and tunable quantity that bridges the asymptotic
world of communication and the finite world of learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病的神经退行性效应不可逆，且神经病理和社会行为风险因素在诊断前多年累积。早期识别高风险个体有助于预防、及时护理和公平资源分配。

Method: 使用SVD插补处理缺失值，分别处理连续和分类变量。评估多种方法后选择XGBoost进行预测，利用SHAP进行事后分析识别关键特征。

Conclusion: 研究证明了社会健康决定因素在认知老化中的多因素性质，以及可解释、数据驱动的SDOH建模的价值。

Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial because its
neurodegenerative effects are irreversible, and neuropathologic and
social-behavioral risk factors accumulate years before diagnosis. Identifying
higher-risk individuals earlier enables prevention, timely care, and equitable
resource allocation. We predict cognitive performance from social determinants
of health (SDOH) using the NIH NIA-supported PREPARE Challenge Phase 2 dataset
derived from the nationally representative Mex-Cog cohort of the 2003 and 2012
Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS).
  Data: The target is a validated composite cognitive score across seven
domains-orientation, memory, attention, language, constructional praxis, and
executive function-derived from the 2016 and 2021 MHAS waves. Predictors span
demographic, socioeconomic, health, lifestyle, psychosocial, and healthcare
access factors.
  Methodology: Missingness was addressed with a singular value decomposition
(SVD)-based imputation pipeline treating continuous and categorical variables
separately. This approach leverages latent feature correlations to recover
missing values while balancing reliability and scalability. After evaluating
multiple methods, XGBoost was chosen for its superior predictive performance.
  Results and Discussion: The framework outperformed existing methods and the
data challenge leaderboard, demonstrating high accuracy, robustness, and
interpretability. SHAP-based post hoc analysis identified top contributing SDOH
factors and age-specific feature patterns. Notably, flooring material emerged
as a strong predictor, reflecting socioeconomic and environmental disparities.
Other influential factors, age, SES, lifestyle, social interaction, sleep,
stress, and BMI, underscore the multifactorial nature of cognitive aging and
the value of interpretable, data-driven SDOH modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR训练中常出现策略熵崩溃问题，导致策略过于确定性化，阻碍探索并限制推理性能。传统的固定系数熵正则化方法效果不稳定，难以适应不同任务和模型的需求。

Method: 提出自适应熵正则化(AER)框架，包含三个组件：难度感知系数分配、初始锚定目标熵和动态全局系数调整，动态平衡探索与利用。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，AER方法持续优于基线方法，既提高了推理准确性，也增强了探索能力。

Conclusion: 自适应熵正则化能有效解决RLVR训练中的熵崩溃问题，通过动态调整熵正则化系数来适应不同难度任务的需求，显著提升大语言模型的推理性能。

Abstract: Reasoning ability has become a defining capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs), with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) emerging as
a key paradigm to enhance it. However, RLVR training often suffers from policy
entropy collapse, where the policy becomes overly deterministic, hindering
exploration and limiting reasoning performance. While entropy regularization is
a common remedy, its effectiveness is highly sensitive to the fixed
coefficient, making it unstable across tasks and models. In this work, we
revisit entropy regularization in RLVR and argue that its potential has been
largely underestimated. Our analysis shows that (i) tasks of varying difficulty
demand distinct exploration intensities, and (ii) balanced exploration may
require the policy entropy to be maintained within a moderate range below its
initial level. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Entropy Regularization (AER)--a
framework that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation via three
components: difficulty-aware coefficient allocation, initial-anchored target
entropy, and dynamic global coefficient adjustment. Experiments on multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that AER consistently outperforms
baselines, improving both reasoning accuracy and exploration capability.

TL;DR: MC#框架通过静态量化和动态专家剪枝相结合，对MoE-LLMs/VLMs进行激进压缩，在保持性能的同时大幅减少存储和计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型虽然通过稀疏激活扩展了模型容量，但预加载所有专家和激活多个专家会带来显著的计算和内存开销，成为模型大小和推理成本的主要贡献者。

Method: 提出PMQ（预加载混合精度量化）通过线性规划优化位分配，平衡专家重要性和量化误差；OTP（在线任意剪枝）使用Gumbel-Softmax采样动态选择专家子集，实现细粒度激活控制。

Result: 在DeepSeek-VL2上，MC#实现了6.2倍的权重压缩，平均2.57位，仅在五个多模态基准测试中准确率下降1.7%；OTP减少专家激活超过20%，性能下降小于1%。

Conclusion: MC#通过PMQ的静态位宽优化和OTP的动态路由相结合，实现了极端的压缩效果，为基于MoE的高效模型部署展示了强大潜力。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) effectively scales large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs) by increasing capacity through sparse activation.
However, preloading all experts into memory and activating multiple experts per
input introduces significant computational and memory overhead, making the
expert module a major contributor to model size and inference cost. To address
this, we propose MC# (Mixture-Compressor-sharp), a framework that combines
static quantization and dynamic expert pruning by leveraging the significance
of experts and tokens for aggressive compression of MoE-LLMs/VLMs. To reduce
storage and loading costs, we introduce Pre-Loading Mixed-Precision
Quantization (PMQ), which optimizes bit allocation via linear programming,
balancing expert importance and quantization error for a Pareto-optimal
trade-off between size and performance. To reduce runtime computation, Online
Top-any Pruning (OTP) uses Gumbel-Softmax sampling to dynamically select a
subset of experts per token, enabling fine-grained control over activation. By
combining PMQ's static bit-width optimization with OTP's dynamic routing, MC#
achieves extreme compression with minimal accuracy loss. On DeepSeek-VL2, MC#
achieves a 6.2 times weight reduction at 2.57 average bits with only a 1.7%
accuracy drop across five multimodal benchmarks. Additionally, OTP reduces
expert activation over 20% with less than 1% performance degradation,
demonstrating strong potential for efficient MoE-based model deployment.

Motivation: 传统基于Bradley-Terry的奖励模型难以有效区分相似的偏好响应，容易过拟合简单样本，且在分布外样本上泛化能力不足，导致性能欠佳。

Method: 设计自适应边界机制，基于语义相似度和模型预测奖励差异，从分布角度通过最优传输理论动态调整奖励模型对挑战性样本的关注。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应边界方法有效提升了奖励模型的性能，通过强化学习人类反馈实验验证了其在更好对齐大语言模型与人类偏好方面的实际有效性。

Abstract: The reward model (RM) plays a crucial role in aligning Large Language Models
(LLMs) with human preferences through Reinforcement Learning, where the
Bradley-Terry (BT) objective has been recognized as simple yet powerful,
specifically for pairwise preference learning. However, BT-based RMs often
struggle to effectively distinguish between similar preference responses,
leading to insufficient separation between preferred and non-preferred outputs.
Consequently, they may easily overfit easy samples and cannot generalize well
to Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) samples, resulting in suboptimal performance. To
address these challenges, this paper introduces an effective enhancement to
BT-based RMs through an adaptive margin mechanism. Specifically, we design to
dynamically adjust the RM focus on more challenging samples through margins,
based on both semantic similarity and model-predicted reward differences, which
is approached from a distributional perspective solvable with Optimal Transport
(OT). By incorporating these factors into a principled OT cost matrix design,
our adaptive margin enables the RM to better capture distributional differences
between chosen and rejected responses, yielding significant improvements in
performance, convergence speed, and generalization capabilities. Experimental
results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms
several existing RM techniques, showcasing enhanced performance in both
In-Distribution (ID) and OOD settings. Moreover, RLHF experiments support our
practical effectiveness in better aligning LLMs with human preferences. Our

TL;DR: 4位量化在推理模型中并非最优选择，KV缓存比模型大小更影响内存。研究发现存在规模依赖的权衡：8位4B参数以下的小模型应优先模型容量，而大模型应优先生成长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有4位量化方法在非推理模型和零样本任务中表现良好，但在推理模型中效果不佳，因为KV缓存而非模型大小主导内存使用。需要研究推理模型的内存优化策略。

Method: 在AIME25和GPQA-Diamond数据集上进行1700个推理场景的系统实验，分析不同规模模型的量化效果、内存分配策略和并行扩展效率。

Result: 发现规模依赖的权衡：小模型（<8位4B参数）通过分配更多内存给权重获得更好精度，大模型通过分配内存给更长生成长度获得更好精度。规模阈值还决定并行扩展的内存效率和KV缓存策略选择。

Conclusion: LLM内存优化不能无视规模差异，推理模型的部署优化需要与非推理模型完全不同的策略：小模型优先模型容量，大模型优先测试时计算资源。

Abstract: While 4-bit quantization has emerged as a memory-optimal choice for
non-reasoning models and zero-shot tasks across scales, we show that this
universal prescription fails for reasoning models, where the KV cache rather
than model size can dominate memory. Through systematic experiments across
1,700 inference scenarios on AIME25 and GPQA-Diamond, we find a scale-dependent
trade-off: models with an effective size below 8-bit 4B parameters achieve
better accuracy by allocating memory to more weights rather than longer
generation, while larger models achieve better accuracy by allocating memory to
longer generations. This scale threshold also determines when parallel scaling
becomes memory-efficient and whether KV cache eviction outperforms KV
quantization. Our findings show that memory optimization for LLMs cannot be
scale-agnostic, while providing principled guidelines: for small reasoning
models, prioritize model capacity over test-time compute, while for larger
ones, maximize test-time compute. Our results suggest that optimizing reasoning
models for deployment requires fundamentally different strategies from those
established for non-reasoning models.

Abstract: Derivative-free Bayesian inversion is an important task in many science and
engineering applications, particularly when computing the forward model
derivative is computationally and practically challenging. In this paper, we
introduce Blade, which can produce accurate and well-calibrated posteriors for
Bayesian inversion using an ensemble of interacting particles. Blade leverages
powerful data-driven priors based on diffusion models, and can handle nonlinear
forward models that permit only black-box access (i.e., derivative-free).
Theoretically, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence analysis to
characterize the effects of forward model and prior estimation errors.
Empirically, Blade achieves superior performance compared to existing
derivative-free Bayesian inversion methods on various inverse problems,
including challenging highly nonlinear fluid dynamics.

Motivation: 自监督学习取得了显著成功，但缺乏统一的理论框架来理解和比较不同SSL范式的效率。

Method: 引入信息几何框架，定义表示效率η为学习表示空间的有效内在维度与环境维度的比值，其中有效维度来自编码器诱导的统计流形上Fisher信息矩阵的谱特性。

Result: 在特定自然假设下，证明了Barlow Twins通过将表示的互相关矩阵驱动到单位矩阵，从而诱导各向同性的FIM，达到最优表示效率。

Conclusion: 为理解Barlow Twins的有效性提供了严格的理论基础，并为分析SSL算法提供了新的几何视角。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved remarkable success by learning
meaningful representations without labeled data. However, a unified theoretical
framework for understanding and comparing the efficiency of different SSL
paradigms remains elusive. In this paper, we introduce a novel
information-geometric framework to quantify representation efficiency. We
define representation efficiency $\eta$ as the ratio between the effective
intrinsic dimension of the learned representation space and its ambient
dimension, where the effective dimension is derived from the spectral
properties of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) on the statistical manifold
induced by the encoder. Within this framework, we present a theoretical
analysis of the Barlow Twins method. Under specific but natural assumptions, we
prove that Barlow Twins achieves optimal representation efficiency ($\eta = 1$)
by driving the cross-correlation matrix of representations towards the identity
matrix, which in turn induces an isotropic FIM. This work provides a rigorous
theoretical foundation for understanding the effectiveness of Barlow Twins and
offers a new geometric perspective for analyzing SSL algorithms.

Motivation: 现有方法要么扰动数据使其不可学习，要么重新训练模型以抑制迁移，但都无法控制未知模型的推理，且通常需要控制训练过程。需要一种能在保持数据对授权模型有用性的同时防止非授权利用的机制。

Result: 经验证明，NEs在多种视觉骨干网络和最先进的视觉语言模型上保持性能，而非目标模型即使尝试重建也会崩溃。

Conclusion: NEs是一种实用的方法，可在保持预期数据效用的同时防止未经授权的利用。

Abstract: Recent AI regulations call for data that remain useful for innovation while
resistant to misuse, balancing utility with protection at the model level.
Existing approaches either perturb data to make it unlearnable or retrain
models to suppress transfer, but neither governs inference by unknown models,
and both typically require control over training. We propose non-transferable
examples (NEs), a training-free and data-agnostic input-side usage-control
mechanism. We recode inputs within a model-specific low-sensitivity subspace,
preserving outputs for the authorized model while reducing performance on
unauthorized models through subspace misalignment. We establish formal bounds
that guarantee utility for the authorized model and quantify deviation for
unauthorized ones, with the Hoffman-Wielandt inequality linking degradation to
spectral differences. Empirically, NEs retain performance on diverse vision
backbones and state-of-the-art vision-language models under common
preprocessing, whereas non-target models collapse even with reconstruction
attempts. These results establish NEs as a practical means to preserve intended
data utility while preventing unauthorized exploitation. Our project is

Abstract: User representation modeling has become increasingly crucial for personalized
applications, yet existing approaches struggle with generalizability across
domains and sensitivity to noisy behavioral signals. We present InstructUE, an
instruction-aware user embedding foundation model that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to generate general and instruction-aware user representations.
InstructUE introduces a multi-encoder architecture with a lightweight adapter
that efficiently processes heterogeneous data from six different sources while
preserving their structural characteristics. Additionally, it proposes a novel
contrastive-autoregressive training framework that bridges language and
representation spaces through a curated UserQA dataset. The
contrastive-autoregressive training framework simultaneously leverages
autoregressive learning to capture domain knowledge in language space and
contrastive learning to align user-text embeddings in representation space,
thereby enhancing the instruction-awareness and noise-robustness of user
embeddings. Through extensive experiments on real-world applications, we
demonstrate that InstructUE significantly outperforms existing methods across
multiple domains including user prediction, marketing, and recommendation
scenarios. Our results show that instruction-aware user modeling can
effectively achieve instruction-guided denoising of user information in
specific scenarios, paving the way for more generalizable and robust user

*Pranav Ramesh,Arjun Roy,Deepak Ravikumar,Kaushik Roy,Gopalakrishnan Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了EasyCore框架，通过选择AIGN值低的简单样本进行训练，显著提高了对抗性鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有核心集选择算法主要关注干净准确率，在保持对抗鲁棒性方面表现不足，需要从数据中心的视角设计能够提升对抗鲁棒性的方法

Method: 提出将样本的对抗脆弱性与硬度联系起来，使用平均输入梯度范数(AIGN)量化样本硬度，并开发EasyCore算法选择低AIGN的简单样本进行训练

Result: 使用EasyCore选择的数据训练的模型在标准训练和对抗训练下，对抗准确率分别比现有核心集方法提高了7%和5%

Conclusion: AIGN是模型无关的数据集属性，EasyCore是一种高效且广泛适用的数据中心方法，能够有效提升对抗鲁棒性

Abstract: Designing adversarially robust models from a data-centric perspective
requires understanding which input samples are most crucial for learning
resilient features. While coreset selection provides a mechanism for efficient
training on data subsets, current algorithms are designed for clean accuracy
and fall short in preserving robustness. To address this, we propose a
framework linking a sample's adversarial vulnerability to its
\textit{hardness}, which we quantify using the average input gradient norm
(AIGN) over training. We demonstrate that \textit{easy} samples (with low AIGN)
are less vulnerable and occupy regions further from the decision boundary.
Leveraging this insight, we present EasyCore, a coreset selection algorithm
that retains only the samples with low AIGN for training. We empirically show
that models trained on EasyCore-selected data achieve significantly higher
adversarial accuracy than those trained with competing coreset methods under
both standard and adversarial training. As AIGN is a model-agnostic dataset
property, EasyCore is an efficient and widely applicable data-centric method
for improving adversarial robustness. We show that EasyCore achieves up to 7\%
and 5\% improvement in adversarial accuracy under standard training and TRADES
adversarial training, respectively, compared to existing coreset methods.

TL;DR: 开发了一种针对图时间序列的保形预测框架，利用图结构捕获节点间依赖关系，在保证覆盖率的同时显著缩小预测区域体积。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有保形预测方法要么忽略图拓扑结构，要么忽视时间动态性，无法在动态网络环境中提供可靠的不确定性量化。

Method: 基于保形预测的顺序预测区域框架，利用图结构捕获节点间成对依赖关系，提供用户指定的覆盖率保证。

Result: 理论证明相比图无关方法，椭圆预测集体积呈指数级缩小；实证显示在保持期望覆盖率的同时，预测区域比现有方法小80%。

Conclusion: 该框架为图时间序列提供了有效的预测不确定性量化方法，在保证统计可靠性的同时显著提高了预测精度。

Abstract: Trustworthy decision making in networked, dynamic environments calls for
innovative uncertainty quantification substrates in predictive models for graph
time series. Existing conformal prediction (CP) methods have been applied
separately to multivariate time series and static graphs, but they either
ignore the underlying graph topology or neglect temporal dynamics. To bridge
this gap, here we develop a CP-based sequential prediction region framework
tailored for graph time series. A key technical innovation is to leverage the
graph structure and thus capture pairwise dependencies across nodes, while
providing user-specified coverage guarantees on the predictive outcomes. We
formally establish that our scheme yields an exponential shrinkage in the
volume of the ellipsoidal prediction set relative to its graph-agnostic
counterpart. Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that the novel
uncertainty quantification framework maintains desired empirical coverage while
achieving markedly smaller (up to 80% reduction) prediction regions than
existing approaches.

TL;DR: 提出Temporal Alignment Guidance (TAG)方法解决扩散模型中的离流形问题，通过时间预测器估计偏差并引导样本回到期望流形，显著提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成过程中会累积误差，特别是在应用任意引导时，这会破坏样本保真度，出现离流形现象。

Method: 使用时间预测器估计每个时间步的流形偏差，设计TAG引导机制在生成过程中将样本吸引回期望流形。

Result: TAG能持续产生与期望流形对齐的样本，在各种下游任务中显著改善生成质量。

Conclusion: TAG是解决扩散模型离流形问题的通用方案，通过时间对齐引导有效提升生成保真度。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success as generative models.
However, even a well-trained model can accumulate errors throughout the
generation process. These errors become particularly problematic when arbitrary
guidance is applied to steer samples toward desired properties, which often
breaks sample fidelity. In this paper, we propose a general solution to address
the off-manifold phenomenon observed in diffusion models. Our approach
leverages a time predictor to estimate deviations from the desired data
manifold at each timestep, identifying that a larger time gap is associated
with reduced generation quality. We then design a novel guidance mechanism,
`Temporal Alignment Guidance' (TAG), attracting the samples back to the desired
manifold at every timestep during generation. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that TAG consistently produces samples closely aligned with the
desired manifold at each timestep, leading to significant improvements in
generation quality across various downstream tasks.

TL;DR: 提出基于Mamba的DPNet深度学习框架，结合SI-SDR损失和心率预测器，有效去除PPG信号噪声并保持生理信息完整性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光电容积脉搏波(PPG)在可穿戴健康监测中广泛应用，但其可靠性常受噪声和运动伪影影响，限制了心率估计等下游应用

Method: 提出DPNet（基于Mamba的去噪骨干网络）进行有效时序建模，结合尺度不变信噪比(SI-SDR)损失提升波形保真度，并使用辅助心率预测器提供基于心率的生理一致性监督

Result: 在BIDMC数据集上的实验表明，该方法对合成噪声和真实运动伪影均表现出强鲁棒性，优于传统滤波和现有神经模型，能有效恢复PPG信号同时保持心率准确性

Conclusion: SI-SDR损失和心率引导监督具有互补作用，该方法在可穿戴医疗系统中具有实际部署潜力

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) is widely used in wearable health monitoring, but
its reliability is often degraded by noise and motion artifacts, limiting
downstream applications such as heart rate (HR) estimation. This paper presents
a deep learning framework for PPG denoising with an emphasis on preserving
physiological information. In this framework, we propose DPNet, a Mamba-based
denoising backbone designed for effective temporal modeling. To further enhance
denoising performance, the framework also incorporates a scale-invariant
signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) loss to promote waveform fidelity and an
auxiliary HR predictor (HRP) that provides physiological consistency through
HR-based supervision. Experiments on the BIDMC dataset show that our method
achieves strong robustness against both synthetic noise and real-world motion
artifacts, outperforming conventional filtering and existing neural models. Our
method can effectively restore PPG signals while maintaining HR accuracy,
highlighting the complementary roles of SI-SDR loss and HR-guided supervision.
These results demonstrate the potential of our approach for practical
deployment in wearable healthcare systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出ELMO框架，使用BFloat16和Float8数据类型进行纯低精度训练，解决极端多标签分类中线性分类头计算和内存需求大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前XMC方法主要依赖FP16-FP32混合精度训练，存在不稳定、内存使用效率低和计算开销大的问题，而现有低精度方法通常为分类层保留更高精度。

Method: 利用Kahan求和和随机舍入技术，在Float8中完全训练XMC模型，无需单精度主权重或张量缩放，结合梯度融合和分块等内存优化。

Result: 仅使用6.6 GiB GPU内存训练300万标签的XMC模型，相比优化SOTA方法Renee所需的39.7 GiB大幅减少，且不损失精度。

Conclusion: ELMO框架证明XMC模型可以完全在Float8中有效训练，显著降低GPU内存使用，为大规模标签分类提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large output spaces, also referred to as Extreme multilabel classification
(XMC), is a setting that arises, e.g., in large-scale tagging and
product-to-product recommendation, and is characterized by the number of labels
ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions. This means that the linear
classification head, usually only a tiny fraction of the overall model, turns
into the main driver for compute and memory demand. Current state-of-the-art
XMC methods predominantly rely on FP16-FP32 mixed-precision training, which we
show can be unstable, and inefficient in terms of memory usage and
computational overhead. Meanwhile, existing low-precision methods typically
retain higher precision for the classification layer. In this work, we propose
ELMO, a pure low-precision training framework for XMC models using BFloat16 and
Float8 data types. By leveraging Kahan summation and stochastic rounding, we
demonstrate that XMC models can be effectively trained entirely in Float8,
without relying on single-precision master weights or tensor scaling.
Low-precision training, combined with our proposed memory optimizations --
gradient fusion and chunking -- enables significant reductions in GPU memory
usage. For example, we train a 3-million-label XMC model with only 6.6 GiB of
GPU memory, compared to the 39.7 GiB required by the optimized SOTA method,
Renee without compromising accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了AT-GRPO方法，针对多智能体系统中的强化学习挑战，通过智能体和轮次分组算法以及支持单策略和多策略的训练系统，在游戏、规划、编程和数学任务中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统和强化学习被广泛用于增强大语言模型的智能能力，但在多智能体系统中应用在线策略强化学习仍未被充分探索，存在算法和系统层面的独特挑战。

Method: AT-GRPO包括：(i) 针对多智能体系统定制的智能体和轮次分组强化学习算法，(ii) 支持单策略和多策略机制的训练系统。

Result: 在长期规划任务中，准确率从单智能体强化学习基线的14.0-47.0%提升到96.0-99.5%；在编程任务中平均提升3.87-7.62%，在数学任务中平均提升9.0-17.93%。

Conclusion: AT-GRPO在多智能体强化学习环境中表现出色，显著提升了各种任务的性能，为多智能体系统中的强化学习应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely used to
enhance the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). MAS improves
task performance through role-based orchestration, while RL uses environmental
rewards to learn stronger policies, such as GRPO-style optimization. However,
applying on-policy RL to MAS remains underexplored and presents unique
challenges. Algorithmically, standard GRPO grouping assumptions break down
because prompts vary by role and by turn. System-wise, the training stack must
support MAS-workflow rollouts and on-policy updates for both single-policy and
multi-policy models.
  We propose AT-GRPO, which includes (i) an agent- and turn-wise grouped RL
algorithm tailored to MAS and (ii) a training system that supports both single-
and multi-policy regimes. Across game, planning, coding, and math tasks,
AT-GRPO delivers substantial gains. On long-horizon planning, it increases
accuracy from a 14.0 to 47.0 percent single-agent RL baseline to 96.0 to 99.5
percent. It also improves reasoning performance, with average gains of 3.87 to
7.62 percent on coding tasks and 9.0 to 17.93 percent on math. Code and
environments are available at: https://github.com/pettingllms-ai/PettingLLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EAGer是一种基于模型不确定性的训练免费生成方法，通过token级熵分布来减少冗余计算并提升性能，在复杂推理任务中实现最佳效率-性能权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同提示具有不同的复杂度，需要不同的计算资源分配。当前方法为每个提示分配相同计算预算，导致资源浪费。

Method: 利用token级熵分布，仅在出现高熵token时分支到多个推理路径，并将节省的计算预算重新分配给最需要探索替代路径的实例。

Result: 在AIME 2025等复杂推理基准测试中，EAGer无需访问目标标签即可重新分配预算，在推理长度和Pass@k方面实现最佳效率-性能权衡。当可访问目标标签时，生成token减少65%，Pass@k提升37%。

Conclusion: EAGer通过基于不确定性的计算预算动态分配，有效减少了冗余计算并显著提升了推理性能。

Abstract: With the rise of reasoning language models and test-time scaling methods as a
paradigm for improving model performance, substantial computation is often
required to generate multiple candidate sequences from the same prompt. This
enables exploration of different reasoning paths toward the correct solution,
however, allocates the same compute budget for each prompt. Grounded on the
assumption that different prompts carry different degrees of complexity, and
thus different computation needs, we propose EAGer, a training-free generation
method that leverages model uncertainty through token-wise entropy distribution
to reduce redundant computation and concurrently improve overall performance.
EAGer allows branching to multiple reasoning paths only in the presence of
high-entropy tokens, and then reallocates the saved compute budget to the
instances where exploration of alternative paths is most needed. We find that
across multiple open-source models on complex reasoning benchmarks such as AIME
2025, EAGer can reallocate the budget without accessing target labels,
achieving the best efficiency-performance trade-off in terms of reasoning
length and Pass@k. When target labels are accessible, EAGer generates up to 65%
fewer tokens (hence saving compute) and achieves up to 37% improvement in
Pass@k compared to the Full Parallel Sampling.

TL;DR: 提出了一种专为边缘设备设计的单实例测试时自适应方法TED，使用CMA-ES在潜在主子空间进行前向坐标优化，无需反向传播，计算复杂度降低63倍，在ZYNQ-7020平台上成功部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备计算资源有限且面临分布偏移问题，现有TTA方法依赖梯度优化或批处理，不适合资源受限的边缘场景。梯度自由替代方案存在学习能力有限、灵活性不足或架构约束等问题。

Method: 使用协方差矩阵自适应进化策略(CMA-ES)在潜在主子空间进行前向坐标优化，通过更新紧凑的低维向量来增强输出置信度并使潜在表示更接近源潜在分布，保持模型参数冻结。

Result: 在ImageNet和Google Speech Commands数据集上的实验表明，TED达到最先进性能，计算复杂度降低高达63倍，并在ZYNQ-7020平台上成功部署。

Conclusion: TED为边缘设备提供了一种实用且可扩展的解决方案，在真实世界边缘应用中具有可行性和有效性。

Abstract: Edge devices face significant challenges due to limited computational
resources and distribution shifts, making efficient and adaptable machine
learning essential. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often rely on
gradient-based optimization or batch processing, which are inherently
unsuitable for resource-constrained edge scenarios due to their reliance on
backpropagation and high computational demands. Gradient-free alternatives
address these issues but often suffer from limited learning capacity, lack
flexibility, or impose architectural constraints. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel single-instance TTA method tailored for edge
devices (TED), which employs forward-only coordinate optimization in the
principal subspace of latent using the covariance matrix adaptation evolution
strategy (CMA-ES). By updating a compact low-dimensional vector, TED not only
enhances output confidence but also aligns the latent representation closer to
the source latent distribution within the latent principal subspace. This is
achieved without backpropagation, keeping the model parameters frozen, and
enabling efficient, forgetting-free adaptation with minimal memory and
computational overhead. Experiments on image classification and keyword
spotting tasks across the ImageNet and Google Speech Commands series datasets
demonstrate that TED achieves state-of-the-art performance while
$\textit{reducing computational complexity by up to 63 times}$, offering a
practical and scalable solution for real-world edge applications. Furthermore,
we successfully $\textit{deployed TED on the ZYNQ-7020 platform}$,
demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness for resource-constrained edge
devices in real-world deployments.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in reasoning and tool utilization. However, the generalization of
tool-augmented reinforcement learning (RL) across diverse domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we investigate the cross-domain generalization of
an LLM agent equipped with a code interpreter tool, which is exclusively
trained on mathematical problem-solving tasks. Despite the restricted training
domain, we evaluate the agent's performance across several distinct reasoning
domains. The results reveal that RL-based tool usage learned from mathematical
tasks can be effectively transferred to complex tasks in other domains,
enabling great task performance and high token efficiency. To facilitate this
cross-domain transfer, we propose a Tool Generalization Reinforcement Learning
(TGRL) framework designed to promote domain-agnostic learning and skill
migration, encompassing: (i) a standardized tool interface that abstracts
domain-specific nuances through consistent formatting and explicit termination,
fostering transferable invocation patterns; (ii) a dual-component reward system
that decomposes rewards to incentivize generalizable behaviors like tool
efficiency and reasoning abstraction, ensuring alignment and robustness across
domain shifts; and (iii) an XML-based prompt template that separates thinking,
tool calls, and responses to encourage modular, domain-invariant planning and
coherent multi-turn interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks validate our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance and
highlighting the cross-domain potential of Tool RL for LLM reasoning.

Method: 设计时间异构图表示因果过程，通过解缠潜在变量来识别不同时间段的因果关系和对应因果因子

Result: 在真实数据集上实验表明，CDRL4AD在准确性和根因分析方面优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: CDRL4AD能有效检测异常并识别因果关系，帮助专家诊断异常根因，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Disentangling complex causal relationships is important for accurate
detection of anomalies. In multivariate time series analysis, dynamic
interactions among data variables over time complicate the interpretation of
causal relationships. Traditional approaches assume statistical independence
between variables in unsupervised settings, whereas recent methods capture
feature correlations through graph representation learning. However, their
representations fail to explicitly infer the causal relationships over
different time periods. To solve the problem, we propose Causally Disentangled
Representation Learning for Anomaly Detection (CDRL4AD) to detect anomalies and
identify their causal relationships in multivariate time series. First, we
design the causal process as model input, the temporal heterogeneous graph, and
causal relationships. Second, our representation identifies causal
relationships over different time periods and disentangles latent variables to
infer the corresponding causal factors. Third, our experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that CDRL4AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms
of accuracy and root cause analysis. Fourth, our model analysis validates
hyperparameter sensitivity and the time complexity of CDRL4AD. Last, we conduct
a case study to show how our approach assists human experts in diagnosing the
root causes of anomalies.

Abstract: We present Entropic Mutual-Information Geometry Large-Language Model
Alignment (ENIGMA), a novel approach to Large-Language Model (LLM) training
that jointly improves reasoning, alignment and robustness by treating an
organisation's policies/principles as directions to move on a model's
information manifold. Our single-loop trainer combines Group-Relative Policy
Optimisation (GRPO), an on-policy, critic-free RL method with Chain-of-Thought
(CoT)-format only rewards; a Self-Supervised Alignment with Mutual Information
(SAMI)-style symmetric InfoNCE auxiliary; and an entropic Sinkhorn
optimal-transport regulariser on hidden-state distributions to bound geometry
drift. We also introduce infoNCE metrics that specialise to a standard MI lower
bound under matched negatives to measure how strongly a model's CoT encodes
these policies. These metrics include a Sufficiency Index (SI) that enables the
selection and creation of principles that maximise downstream performance prior
to training. In our experiments using small (1B) LLMs, high-SI principles
predict steadier training dynamics and improved benchmark performance over GRPO
ablations. Our information-geometry analysis of trained models validates
desirable structural change in the manifold. These results support our
hypothesis that reasoning, alignment, and robustness are projections of a
single informationgeometric objective, and that models trained using ENIGMA
demonstrate principled reasoning without the use of a reward model, offering a
path to trusted capability

Abstract: Missing or corrupted modalities are common in physiological signal-based
medical applications owing to hardware constraints or motion artifacts.
However, most existing methods assume the availability of all modalities,
resulting in substantial performance degradation in the absence of any
modality. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes PhysioME, a robust
framework designed to ensure reliable performance under missing modality
conditions. PhysioME adopts: (1) a multimodal self-supervised learning approach
that combines contrastive learning with masked prediction; (2) a
Dual-PathNeuroNet backbone tailored to capture the temporal dynamics of each
physiological signal modality; and (3) a restoration decoder that reconstructs
missing modality tokens, enabling flexible processing of incomplete inputs. The
experimental results show that PhysioME achieves high consistency and
generalization performance across various missing modality scenarios. These
findings highlight the potential of PhysioME as a reliable tool for supporting
clinical decision-making in real-world settings with imperfect data
availability.

Conclusion: RFTHGS框架证明小型专用LLM通过精细微调可以超越大型通用模型和专家设计，为组合优化问题提供了更高效的自动化启发式设计方法。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated
heuristic designers for vehicle routing problems (VRPs), current
state-of-the-art methods predominantly rely on prompting massive,
general-purpose models like GPT-4. This work challenges that paradigm by
demonstrating that a smaller, specialized LLM, when meticulously fine-tuned,
can generate components that surpass expert-crafted heuristics within advanced
solvers. We propose RFTHGS, a novel Reinforcement learning (RL) framework for
Fine-Tuning a small LLM to generate high-performance crossover operators for
the Hybrid Genetic Search (HGS) solver, applied to the Capacitated VRP (CVRP).
Our method employs a multi-tiered, curriculum-based reward function that
progressively guides the LLM to master generating first compilable, then
executable, and finally, superior-performing operators that exceed human expert
designs. This is coupled with an operator caching mechanism that discourages
plagiarism and promotes diversity during training. Comprehensive experiments
show that our fine-tuned LLM produces crossover operators which significantly
outperform the expert-designed ones in HGS. The performance advantage remains
consistent, generalizing from small-scale instances to large-scale problems
with up to 1000 nodes. Furthermore, RFTHGS exceeds the performance of leading
neuro-combinatorial baselines, prompt-based methods, and commercial LLMs such
as GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini.

pixels and interaction. We present ReLook, an agentic, vision-grounded
reinforcement learning framework that empowers an agent to close a robust
generate--diagnose--refine loop by invoking a multimodal LLM (MLLM) as a tool.
During training, the agent uses the MLLM-in-the-loop both as a visual
critic--scoring code with screenshots--and as a source of actionable,
vision-grounded feedback; a strict zero-reward rule for invalid renders anchors
renderability and prevents reward hacking. To prevent behavioral collapse, we
introduce Forced Optimization, a strict acceptance rule that admits only
improving revisions, yielding monotonically better trajectories. At inference,
we decouple the critic and run a lightweight, critic-free self-edit cycle,
keeping latency comparable to base decoding while retaining most of the gains.
Across three widely used benchmarks, ReLook consistently outperforms strong
baselines in vision-grounded front-end code generation, highlighting the
benefits of agentic perception, visual rewards, and training-inference
decoupling.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多级跨模态知识蒸馏框架(MLCM-KD)，通过双向知识注入机制(DIKD)解决热成像面部关键点检测中的模态差异问题，实现了高效准确的热成像FLD模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热成像面部关键点检测在挑战性光照条件下很重要，但缺乏丰富的视觉线索。传统的跨模态方法计算昂贵或引入结构伪影，限制了实际部署。

Method: 提出MLCM-KD框架，将高保真RGB到热成像知识传递与模型压缩解耦。引入DIKD双向机制，不仅用RGB特征指导学生，还将学生学到的表征反馈给冻结的教师预测头，强制学生学习与教师语义对齐的模态不变特征。

Result: 在公开热成像FLD基准测试中达到了新的最先进水平，显著优于先前方法，同时大幅减少计算开销。

Conclusion: 该方法通过双向知识蒸馏机制有效解决了RGB和热成像数据之间的模态差异问题，实现了鲁棒且深入的知识传递，为热成像面部关键点检测提供了高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Facial Landmark Detection (FLD) in thermal imagery is critical for
applications in challenging lighting conditions, but it is hampered by the lack
of rich visual cues. Conventional cross-modal solutions, like feature fusion or
image translation from RGB data, are often computationally expensive or
introduce structural artifacts, limiting their practical deployment. To address
this, we propose Multi-Level Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation (MLCM-KD), a
novel framework that decouples high-fidelity RGB-to-thermal knowledge transfer
from model compression to create both accurate and efficient thermal FLD
models. A central challenge during knowledge transfer is the profound modality
gap between RGB and thermal data, where traditional unidirectional distillation
fails to enforce semantic consistency across disparate feature spaces. To
overcome this, we introduce Dual-Injected Knowledge Distillation (DIKD), a
bidirectional mechanism designed specifically for this task. DIKD establishes a
connection between modalities: it not only guides the thermal student with rich
RGB features but also validates the student's learned representations by
feeding them back into the frozen teacher's prediction head. This closed-loop
supervision forces the student to learn modality-invariant features that are
semantically aligned with the teacher, ensuring a robust and profound knowledge
transfer. Experiments show that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on
public thermal FLD benchmarks, notably outperforming previous methods while
drastically reducing computational overhead.

Motivation: 现有方法在近似扩散大语言模型的似然函数时需要保留所有蒙特卡洛样本的前向计算图，导致显著内存开销，限制了样本大小和近似精度。

Method: 设计满足线性和等价性两个关键性质的特殊下界，使梯度可以跨样本累积，实现恒定内存使用。

Result: 在数学问题解决、代码生成和规划任务中，BGPO显著优于之前的RL算法。

Conclusion: BGPO通过内存高效的RL算法解决了扩散大语言模型训练中的关键瓶颈，实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: A key challenge in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to diffusion large
language models (dLLMs) lies in the intractability of their likelihood
functions, which are essential for the RL objective, necessitating
corresponding approximation in each training step. While existing methods
approximate the log-likelihoods by their evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) via
customized Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, the forward computational graphs of all
MC samples need to be retained for the gradient computation of non-linear terms
in the RL objective, resulting in significant memory overhead. This constraint
restricts feasible sample sizes, leading to imprecise likelihood approximations
and ultimately distorting the RL objective. To overcome this limitation, we
propose \emph{Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization} (BGPO), a memory-efficient
RL algorithm that maximizes a specially constructed lower bound of the
ELBO-based objective. This lower bound is carefully designed to satisfy two key
properties: (1) Linearity: it is formulated in a linear sum where each term
depends only on a single MC sample, thereby enabling gradient accumulation
across samples and ensuring constant memory usage; (2) Equivalence: Both the
value and gradient of this lower bound are equal to those of the ELBO-based
objective in on-policy training, making it also an effective approximation for
the original RL objective. These properties allow BGPO to adopt a large MC
sample size, resulting in more accurate likelihood approximations and improved
RL objective estimation, which in turn leads to enhanced performance.
Experiments show that BGPO significantly outperforms previous RL algorithms for
dLLMs in math problem solving, code generation, and planning tasks.

TL;DR: TACT是一种测试时适应方法，通过识别和去除表示中的非因果成分来提升模型在分布偏移下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型性能在分布偏移下下降的主要原因是模型依赖与预测目标没有直接因果关系的特征。

Method: 应用数据增强保留因果特征同时变化非因果特征，使用主成分分析识别与非因果特征相关的高方差方向，通过去除这些方向的投影来修剪表示。

Result: 在真实世界分布外基准测试中，TACT始终显著优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过因果修剪方法可以有效提升模型在分布偏移下的适应能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation aims to improve model robustness under distribution
shifts by adapting models with access to unlabeled target samples. A primary
cause of performance degradation under such shifts is the model's reliance on
features that lack a direct causal relationship with the prediction target. We
introduce Test-time Adaptation by Causal Trimming (TACT), a method that
identifies and removes non-causal components from representations for test
distributions. TACT applies data augmentations that preserve causal features
while varying non-causal ones. By analyzing the changes in the representations
using Principal Component Analysis, TACT identifies the highest variance
directions associated with non-causal features. It trims the representations by
removing their projections on the identified directions, and uses the trimmed
representations for the predictions. During adaptation, TACT continuously
tracks and refines these directions to get a better estimate of non-causal
features. We theoretically analyze the effectiveness of this approach and
empirically validate TACT on real-world out-of-distribution benchmarks. TACT
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.

<details>

Motivation: RL对LLM推理能力至关重要，但资源消耗大，需要大量GPU内存和长训练时间。

Method: 结合NVFP4量化和LoRA，引入自适应量化噪声机制动态调整训练过程中的噪声。

Result: 在rollout阶段实现1.5倍加速，首次在单张H100 80GB GPU上训练32B LLM，在GSM8K和MATH 500基准测试中达到90.8%和77.4%的准确率。

Conclusion: QeRL是一个高效且有效的LLM强化学习训练框架。

Abstract: We propose QeRL, a Quantization-enhanced Reinforcement Learning framework for
large language models (LLMs). While RL is essential for LLMs' reasoning
capabilities, it is resource-intensive, requiring substantial GPU memory and
long rollout durations. QeRL addresses these issues by combining NVFP4
quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), accelerating rollout phase of RL
while reducing memory overhead. Beyond efficiency, our findings show that
quantization noise increases policy entropy, enhancing exploration, and
enabling the discovery of better strategies during RL. To further optimize
exploration, QeRL introduces an Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN) mechanism,
which dynamically adjusts noise during training. Experiments demonstrate that
QeRL delivers over 1.5 times speedup in the rollout phase. Moreover, this is
the first framework to enable RL training of a 32B LLM on a single H100 80GB
GPU, while delivering overall speedups for RL training. It also achieves faster
reward growth and higher final accuracy than 16-bit LoRA and QLoRA, while
matching the performance of full-parameter fine-tuning on mathematical
benchmarks such as GSM8K (90.8%) and MATH 500 (77.4%) in the 7B model. These
results establish QeRL as an efficient and effective framework for RL training
in LLMs.

Conclusion: 通过平衡核的多样性和个体效能，提出的方法显著提升了两样本和独立性检验的性能。

Abstract: To adapt kernel two-sample and independence testing to complex structured
data, aggregation of multiple kernels is frequently employed to boost testing
power compared to single-kernel tests. However, we observe a phenomenon that
directly maximizing multiple kernel-based statistics may result in highly
similar kernels that capture highly overlapping information, limiting the
effectiveness of aggregation. To address this, we propose an aggregated
statistic that explicitly incorporates kernel diversity based on the covariance
between different kernels. Moreover, we identify a fundamental challenge: a
trade-off between the diversity among kernels and the test power of individual
kernels, i.e., the selected kernels should be both effective and diverse. This
motivates a testing framework with selection inference, which leverages
information from the training phase to select kernels with strong individual
performance from the learned diverse kernel pool. We provide rigorous
theoretical statements and proofs to show the consistency on the test power and
control of Type-I error, along with asymptotic analysis of the proposed
statistics. Lastly, we conducted extensive empirical experiments demonstrating
the superior performance of our proposed approach across various benchmarks for
both two-sample and independence testing.

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的预测式异常检测框架，系统评估了经典方法和深度学习模型在时间序列异常检测中的表现，发现LSTM在复杂模式上表现最佳，Informer在效率上更优，经典方法适合简单周期性数据。


<details>

Motivation: 现有时间序列异常检测方法缺乏系统性的跨领域评估，需要建立统一的评估框架来比较不同方法的性能。

Method: 构建模块化流水线，集成预处理、四种预测模型（Holt-Winters、SARIMA、LSTM、Informer）、四种检测方法，使用残差检测接口，在Numenta异常基准上进行全面评估。

Result: LSTM获得最佳性能（F1: 0.688，在81%数据集上排名第一或第二），Informer提供竞争性精度（F1: 0.683）且训练速度快30%，经典方法在简单合成数据上表现完美但真实数据集上F1分数差2-3倍。

Conclusion: 预测质量主导检测性能，建议复杂模式使用LSTM，效率关键部署使用Informer，资源受限的简单周期性数据使用经典方法，为基于预测的异常检测研究建立了基准。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical for modern digital infrastructures,
yet existing methods lack systematic cross-domain evaluation. We present a
comprehensive forecasting-based framework unifying classical methods
(Holt-Winters, SARIMA) with deep learning architectures (LSTM, Informer) under
a common residual-based detection interface. Our modular pipeline integrates
preprocessing (normalization, STL decomposition), four forecasting models, four
detection methods, and dual evaluation through forecasting metrics (MAE, RMSE,
PCC) and detection metrics (Precision, Recall, F1, AUC). We conduct the first
complete evaluation on the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (58 datasets, 7
categories) with 232 model training runs and 464 detection evaluations
achieving 100\% success rate. LSTM achieves best performance (F1: 0.688,
ranking first or second on 81\% of datasets) with exceptional correlation on
complex patterns (PCC: 0.999). Informer provides competitive accuracy (F1:
0.683) with 30\% faster training. Classical methods achieve perfect predictions
on simple synthetic data with 60 lower cost but show 2-3 worse F1-scores on
real-world datasets. Forecasting quality dominates detection performance:
differences between detection methods (F1: 0.621-0.688) are smaller than
between forecasting models (F1: 0.344-0.688). Our findings provide
evidence-based guidance: use LSTM for complex patterns, Informer for
efficiency-critical deployments, and classical methods for simple periodic data
with resource constraints. The complete implementation and results establish
baselines for future forecasting-based anomaly detection research.

Abstract: Understanding how learning algorithms shape the computational strategies that
emerge in neural networks remains a fundamental challenge in machine
intelligence. While network architectures receive extensive attention, the role
of the learning paradigm itself in determining emergent dynamics remains
largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) and
supervised learning (SL) drive recurrent neural networks (RNNs) toward
fundamentally different computational solutions when trained on identical
decision-making tasks. Through systematic dynamical systems analysis, we reveal
that RL spontaneously discovers hybrid attractor architectures, combining
stable fixed-point attractors for decision maintenance with quasi-periodic
attractors for flexible evidence integration. This contrasts sharply with SL,
which converges almost exclusively to simpler fixed-point-only solutions. We
further show that RL sculpts functionally balanced neural populations through a
powerful form of implicit regularization -- a structural signature that
enhances robustness and is conspicuously absent in the more heterogeneous
solutions found by SL-trained networks. The prevalence of these complex
dynamics in RL is controllably modulated by weight initialization and
correlates strongly with performance gains, particularly as task complexity
increases. Our results establish the learning algorithm as a primary
determinant of emergent computation, revealing how reward-based optimization
autonomously discovers sophisticated dynamical mechanisms that are less
accessible to direct gradient-based optimization. These findings provide both
mechanistic insights into neural computation and actionable principles for
designing adaptive AI systems.

Abstract: The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in real-world and high-risk
applications has intensified the discussion about their trustworthiness and
ethical usage, from both a technical and a legislative perspective. The field
of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) addresses this challenge by
proposing explanations that bring to light the decision-making processes of
complex black-box models. Despite being an essential property, the robustness
of explanations is often an overlooked aspect during development: only robust
explanation methods can increase the trust in the system as a whole. This paper
investigates the role of robustness through the usage of a feature importance
aggregation derived from multiple models ($k$-nearest neighbours, random forest
and neural networks). Preliminary results showcase the potential in increasing
the trustworthiness of the application, while leveraging multiple model's
predictive power.

Abstract: Deciphering the function of unseen protein sequences is a fundamental
challenge with broad scientific impact, yet most existing methods depend on
task-specific adapters or large-scale supervised fine-tuning. We introduce the
"Protein-as-Second-Language" framework, which reformulates amino-acid sequences
as sentences in a novel symbolic language that large language models can
interpret through contextual exemplars. Our approach adaptively constructs
sequence-question-answer triples that reveal functional cues in a zero-shot
setting, without any further training. To support this process, we curate a
bilingual corpus of 79,926 protein-QA instances spanning attribute prediction,
descriptive understanding, and extended reasoning. Empirically, our method
delivers consistent gains across diverse open-source LLMs and GPT-4, achieving
up to 17.2% ROUGE-L improvement (average +7%) and even surpassing fine-tuned
protein-specific language models. These results highlight that generic LLMs,
when guided with protein-as-language cues, can outperform domain-specialized
models, offering a scalable pathway for protein understanding in foundation
models.

Conclusion: 现有漏洞检测器存在严重的偏差问题，其预测往往受到非漏洞代码行的影响，需要改进模型以更好地定位真实漏洞位置。

Abstract: To address the extremely concerning problem of software vulnerability, system
security is often entrusted to Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Despite their
now established detection capabilities, such models are limited by design to
flagging the entire input source code function as vulnerable, rather than
precisely localizing the concerned code lines. However, the detection
granularity is crucial to support human operators during software development,
ensuring that such predictions reflect the true code semantics to help debug,
evaluate, and fix the detected vulnerabilities. To address this issue, recent
work made progress toward improving the detector's localization ability, thus
narrowing down the vulnerability detection "window" and providing more
fine-grained predictions. Such approaches, however, implicitly disregard the
presence of spurious correlations and biases in the data, which often
predominantly influence the performance of ML algorithms. In this work, we
investigate how detectors comply with this requirement by proposing an
explainability-based evaluation procedure. Our approach, defined as Detection
Alignment (DA), quantifies the agreement between the input source code lines
that most influence the prediction and the actual localization of the
vulnerability as per the ground truth. Through DA, which is model-agnostic and
adaptable to different detection tasks, not limited to our use case, we analyze
multiple learning-based vulnerability detectors and datasets. As a result, we
show how the predictions of such models are consistently biased by
non-vulnerable lines, ultimately highlighting the high impact of biases and
spurious correlations. The code is available at

Abstract: Many machine learning applications require outputs that satisfy complex,

Network models due to the variable output sizes of graph-structured data. In
this paper, we introduce ProjNet, a Graph Neural Network framework which
satisfies input-dependant constraints. ProjNet combines a sparse vector
clipping method with the Component-Averaged Dykstra (CAD) algorithm, an
iterative scheme for solving the best-approximation problem. We establish a
convergence result for CAD and develop a GPU-accelerated implementation capable
of handling large-scale inputs efficiently. To enable end-to-end training, we
introduce a surrogate gradient for CAD that is both computationally efficient
and better suited for optimization than the exact gradient. We validate ProjNet
on four classes of constrained optimisation problems: linear programming, two
classes of non-convex quadratic programs, and radio transmit power
optimization, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse problem settings.

Conclusion: NWC为语言模型权重压缩提供了一种有效的学习型解决方案，显著优于传统手动设计的压缩方法。

Abstract: The efficient storage and transmission of language model weights is becoming
increasingly important, as their scale and adoption continue to grow. However,
as our understanding of this new data modality is limited, designing a good
compression algorithm for language model weights heavily relies on manual,
trial-and-error approaches. In this paper, we propose a learned compression
framework that trains neural codecs directly from pretrained language model
weights. Unlike conventional data (e.g., images), language model weights pose
unique challenges: the sizes and shapes of weight tensors vary significantly,
and the reconstruction quality must be judged by downstream model predictions
rather than na\"ive MSE loss. To address this, we introduce Neural Weight
Compression (NWC), a novel autoencoder-based neural codec tailored to model
weight compression. The proposed method inherits the advantages of
autoencoder-based codecs while incorporating three technical components: (1)
column-wise tensor chunking and normalization; (2) an importance-aware training
loss; (3) an inference-time error compensation mechanism guided by model
outputs. Experiments on open-weight language models show that NWC achieves
competitive or state-of-the-art accuracy-compression tradeoffs, with
particularly strong results at 4-6 bit precisions where accuracy remains nearly
on par with FP16 models.

this work, we address the inverse problem of learning CGs directly from
observed signals. We propose a principled framework based on maximum
pseudo-likelihood under a consistency assumption, which enforces spectral
properties linking the connection Laplacian to the underlying combinatorial
Laplacian. Based on this formulation, we introduce the Structured Connection
Graph Learning (SCGL) algorithm, a block-optimization procedure over Riemannian
manifolds that jointly infers network topology, edge weights, and geometric
structure. Our experiments show that SCGL consistently outperforms existing
baselines in both topological recovery and geometric fidelity, while remaining
computationally efficient.

TL;DR: 提出了一种快速半监督图嵌入框架，通过联合优化结构保持、监督正则化和半监督传播三个互补目标，在缺乏节点特征信息的图上实现高效节点分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多现实世界图中的节点缺乏信息丰富的特征向量，仅能利用邻域连接性和类别标签作为可用信号，需要学习能够捕捉结构角色和拓扑上下文的节点嵌入。

Method: 联合优化三个目标：通过可扩展模块化近似实现无监督结构保持、最小化标记节点类内方差的监督正则化、以及基于随机游走和注意力加权相似度的半监督标签传播。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，该方法始终达到与最先进方法相当或更优的分类准确率，同时计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 该框架能够生成高质量节点嵌入，在计算效率和分类性能之间取得了良好平衡，适用于特征信息匮乏的图数据学习任务。

Abstract: Graph-based learning is a cornerstone for analyzing structured data, with
node classification as a central task. However, in many real-world graphs,
nodes lack informative feature vectors, leaving only neighborhood connectivity
and class labels as available signals. In such cases, effective classification
hinges on learning node embeddings that capture structural roles and
topological context. We introduce a fast semi-supervised embedding framework
that jointly optimizes three complementary objectives: (i) unsupervised
structure preservation via scalable modularity approximation, (ii) supervised
regularization to minimize intra-class variance among labeled nodes, and (iii)
semi-supervised propagation that refines unlabeled nodes through
random-walk-based label spreading with attention-weighted similarity. These
components are unified into a single iterative optimization scheme, yielding
high-quality node embeddings. On standard benchmarks, our method consistently
achieves classification accuracy at par with or superior to state-of-the-art
approaches, while requiring significantly less computational cost.

Result: 相比直接在原始数据上应用分类器，该方法在平衡准确率方面表现更好

Abstract: As clinical data are becoming increasingly available, machine learning
methods have been employed to extract knowledge from them and predict clinical
events. While promising, approaches suffer from at least two main issues: low
availability of labelled data and data heterogeneity leading to missing values.
This work proposes the use of self-supervised auto-encoders to efficiently
address these challenges. We apply our methodology to a clinical dataset from
patients with ischaemic heart disease. Patient data is embedded in a latent
space, built using unlabelled data, which is then used to train a neural
network classifier to predict cardiovascular death. Results show improved
balanced accuracy compared to applying the classifier directly to the raw data,
demonstrating that this solution is promising, especially in conditions where
availability of unlabelled data could increase.

TL;DR: 提出了一种细粒度联邦LoRA调优方法，通过分别调优A矩阵中编码共享知识的方向向量和B矩阵中编码个性化知识的幅度向量，在异构数据场景下同时提升全局模型的泛化能力和局部模型的个性化适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦高效微调中存在的两个问题：在异构数据场景下，客户端漂移削弱全局模型的泛化能力，且局部模型难以满足个性化需求；现有联邦LoRA技术缺乏对调优矩阵的细粒度分析。

Method: 基于LoRA矩阵向量敏感性的发现，分别调优A矩阵中更敏感的方向向量（编码共享知识）和B矩阵中更敏感的幅度向量（编码个性化知识），采用全局和局部优化器结合的管道方法实现协同优化。

Result: 在Databricks-Dolly-15k和Natural Instructions数据集上使用LLaMA2-7B和Deepseek-7B进行实验，全局性能提升0.39%，局部性能提升0.59%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了异构数据场景下联邦微调的挑战，同时提升了全局模型的泛化能力和局部模型的个性化适应能力。

Abstract: Federated efficient fine-tuning has emerged as an approach that leverages
distributed data and computational resources across nodes to address the
challenges of large-scale fine-tuning and privacy preservation. The Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient fine-tuning of large-scale pre-trained
models by introducing trainable low-rank matrices into weight updates.However,
in heterogeneous data scenarios, client drift weakens the generalization of the
global model, and local models often fail to meet the personalized needs of
individual clients.Moreover, existing federated LoRA efficient fine-tuning
techniques overlook fine-grained analysis of the tuning matrices. To address
this, we conducted preliminary experiments and found that different LoRA
matrices exhibit different sensitivity to changes in the direction and
magnitude of their vectors.We thus propose a fine-grained federated LoRA tuning
method. By fine-tuning the more sensitive directional vectors in the A matrix,
which encode shared knowledge, our method learns shared features more
effectively across clients and enhances global generalization. Simultaneously,
by fine-tuning the more sensitive magnitude vectors in the B matrix, which
encode personalized knowledge, our method better captures personalized
knowledge, enabling detailed adaptation to local data. The method uses a
pipeline combining global and local optimizers. Global optimization further
improves local models, achieving collaborative optimization between global and
local levels. This improves both the generalization ability of the global model
and the personalized adaptation of local models under heterogeneous data
scenarios. Experiments on Databricks-Dolly-15k and Natural Instructions with
LLaMA2-7B and Deepseek-7B confirm that our method improves global performance
by 0.39% and local performance by 0.59%.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在建模基于网格的交通数据复杂空间依赖性方面的固有困难，以及处理密集地理网格信息时效率低下和上下文过载的问题。

Method: 使用Vision-LLM视觉编码器处理历史全局交通矩阵作为图像序列；引入高效编码方案将浮点值表示为单个token；采用两阶段数值对齐微调：监督微调(SFT)和基于GRPO的强化学习优化。

Result: 在真实移动流量数据集上，ST-Vision-LLM在长期预测精度上比现有方法提升15.6%，在跨域少样本场景中超过次优基线30.04%。

Conclusion: 该模型在各种数据稀缺环境中展现出强大的泛化能力，验证了将时空预测重构为视觉-语言融合问题的有效性。

Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal traffic forecasting is a critical prerequisite for
proactive resource management in dense urban mobile networks. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in time series analysis, they
inherently struggle to model the complex spatial dependencies of grid-based
traffic data. Effectively extending LLMs to this domain is challenging, as
representing the vast amount of information from dense geographical grids can
be inefficient and overwhelm the model's context. To address these challenges,
we propose ST-Vision-LLM, a novel framework that reframes spatiotemporal
forecasting as a vision-language fusion problem. Our approach leverages a
Vision-LLM visual encoder to process historical global traffic matrices as
image sequences, providing the model with a comprehensive global view to inform
cell-level predictions. To overcome the inefficiency of LLMs in handling
numerical data, we introduce an efficient encoding scheme that represents
floating-point values as single tokens via a specialized vocabulary, coupled
with a two-stage numerical alignment fine-tuning process. The model is first
trained with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and then further optimized for
predictive accuracy using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a
memory-efficient reinforcement learning method. Evaluations on real-world
mobile traffic datasets demonstrate that ST-Vision-LLM outperforms existing
methods by 15.6% in long-term prediction accuracy and exceeds the second-best
baseline by over 30.04% in cross-domain few-shot scenarios. Our extensive
experiments validate the model's strong generalization capabilities across
various data-scarce environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存检索方法存在显著效率和精度瓶颈，特别是在长输出推理场景中，由于逐令牌检索和粗粒度页面级KV管理导致性能下降。

Method: 基于关键KV具有强时间局部性和不同分布模式的观察，提出语义感知检索策略（仅在语义边界触发检索）和解耦的细粒度管理方案（为输入和输出序列定制差异化策略）。

Result: 在多样化长序列任务中，相比最先进的KV检索方法实现高达4.7倍加速，同时保持接近无损的精度。

Conclusion: LouisKV通过利用KV的时间局部性和分布特性，有效解决了长序列场景下KV缓存的内存和效率问题。

Abstract: While Key-Value (KV) cache succeeds in reducing redundant computations in
auto-regressive models, it introduces significant memory overhead, limiting its
practical deployment in long-sequence scenarios. Existing KV retrieval methods
mitigate this by dynamically retaining only a subset of KV entries on the GPU.
However, they still suffer from notable efficiency and accuracy bottlenecks due
to per-token retrieval and coarse-grained page-level KV management, especially
in long-output reasoning scenarios. With the emergence of large reasoning
models, efficiently handling such scenarios has become increasingly important.
To address this issue, we present two key observations: (1) critical KVs
exhibit strong temporal locality during decoding, and (2) these KVs exhibit
distinct distribution patterns across the input prompt and generated output.
Building on these observations, we propose LouisKV, an efficient KV cache
retrieval framework designed for various long-sequence scenarios. Specifically,
LouisKV introduces a semantic-aware retrieval strategy leveraging temporal
locality to trigger retrieval only at semantic boundaries, drastically reducing
computation and data transfer overhead. LouisKV also designs a decoupled,
fine-grained management scheme that tailors differentiated strategies for input
and output sequences to create retrieval units that better match the model's
attention patterns, enabling precise identification of critical KVs.
Furthermore, to boost efficiency, LouisKV incorporates several kernel-level
optimizations, including custom Triton and CUDA kernels to accelerate the KV
clustering and retrieval. Evaluations show that LouisKV achieves up to
4.7$\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art KV retrieval methods while
maintaining near-lossless accuracy across diverse long-sequence tasks,
including long-input short-output, short-input long-output, and long-input
long-output scenarios.

Motivation: 虽然在视觉和语言领域风格转换方法已经成熟，但在时序数据领域的方法仍然有限。时序风格转换在数据增强和场景模拟等应用中具有重要意义，可以帮助机器学习模型在数据稀缺领域实现更好的泛化能力。

Method: 使用卷积编码器将时序数据解耦为内容和风格表示，通过自监督注意力扩散过程重新组合这些表示。在推理时，从两个不同的时序序列中提取内容和风格，实现条件生成以实现风格转换。

Result: 定性和定量分析表明DiffTSST实现了有效的风格转换。通过DiffTSST进行数据增强可以改善在数据稀缺情况下的异常检测性能。

Conclusion: DiffTSST框架为时序数据风格转换提供了有效的解决方案，在数据增强和异常检测等实际应用中展现出实用价值。

Abstract: Style transfer combines the content of one signal with the style of another.
It supports applications such as data augmentation and scenario simulation,
helping machine learning models generalize in data-scarce domains. While well
developed in vision and language, style transfer methods for time series data
remain limited. We introduce DiffTSST, a diffusion-based framework that
disentangles a time series into content and style representations via
convolutional encoders and recombines them through a self-supervised
attention-based diffusion process. At inference, encoders extract content and
style from two distinct series, enabling conditional generation of novel
samples to achieve style transfer. We demonstrate both qualitatively and
quantitatively that DiffTSST achieves effective style transfer. We further
validate its real-world utility by showing that data augmentation with DiffTSST
improves anomaly detection in data-scarce regimes.

Abstract: Real-world graph typically evolve via a series of events, modeling dynamic
interactions between objects across various domains. For dynamic graph
learning, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as popular
solutions. Recently, prompt learning methods have been explored on dynamic
graphs. However, existing methods generally focus on capturing the relationship
between nodes and time, while overlooking the impact of historical events. In
this paper, we propose EVP, an event-aware dynamic graph prompt learning
framework that can serve as a plug-in to existing methods, enhancing their
ability to leverage historical events knowledge. First, we extract a series of
historical events for each node and introduce an event adaptation mechanism to
align the fine-grained characteristics of these events with downstream tasks.
Second, we propose an event aggregation mechanism to effectively integrate
historical knowledge into node representations. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on four public datasets to evaluate and analyze EVP.

Conclusion: 异步强化学习后训练可以显著提升资源利用率和可扩展性，同时保持与同步训练相当的性能表现。

Abstract: Synchronous Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training has emerged as a
crucial step for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse
capabilities. However, many systems designed to accelerate RL post-training
still suffer from low resource utilization and limited scalability. We present
ROLL Flash, a system that extends ROLL with native support for asynchronous RL
post-training. ROLL Flash is built upon two core design principles:
fine-grained parallelism and rollout-train decoupling. Guided by these
principles, ROLL Flash provides flexible programming interfaces that enable a
fully asynchronous training architecture and support efficient rollout
mechanisms, including queue scheduling and environment-level asynchronous
execution. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that ROLL Flash significantly improves resource
utilization and scalability over synchronous RL post-training. ROLL Flash
achieves up to 2.24x speedup on RLVR tasks and 2.72x on agentic tasks, using
the same GPU budget as synchronous baselines. Furthermore, we implement several
popular off-policy algorithms and verify that asynchronous training can achieve
performance on par with synchronous training.

TL;DR: 提出多视图特征传播(MFP)框架，通过将特征划分为多个高斯噪声视图并在图拓扑中独立传播，在特征稀疏情况下提升节点分类性能并保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中图神经网络面临特征矩阵高度稀疏或包含敏感信息的问题，导致性能下降和隐私风险增加，需要同时解决稀疏性和隐私保护的挑战。

Method: 扩展传统特征传播方法，将可用特征划分为多个添加高斯噪声的视图，每个视图通过图拓扑独立传播信息，最后聚合得到鲁棒的节点嵌入表示。

Result: 在多个图数据集上的实验表明，MFP在节点分类任务上优于现有基线方法，同时显著减少隐私泄露，传播输出作为原始特征的替代插补而非重建。

Conclusion: MFP为具有缺失或敏感特征的图学习领域提供了一个有效且隐私感知的框架，在保持实用性的同时不损害隐私。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in node
classification tasks over relational data, yet their effectiveness often
depends on the availability of complete node features. In many real-world
scenarios, however, feature matrices are highly sparse or contain sensitive
information, leading to degraded performance and increased privacy risks.
Furthermore, direct exposure of information can result in unintended data
leakage, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive information. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel Multi-view Feature Propagation (MFP) framework
that enhances node classification under feature sparsity while promoting
privacy preservation. MFP extends traditional Feature Propagation (FP) by
dividing the available features into multiple Gaussian-noised views, each
propagating information independently through the graph topology. The
aggregated representations yield expressive and robust node embeddings. This
framework is novel in two respects: it introduces a mechanism that improves
robustness under extreme sparsity, and it provides a principled way to balance
utility with privacy. Extensive experiments conducted on graph datasets
demonstrate that MFP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in node
classification while substantially reducing privacy leakage. Moreover, our
analysis demonstrates that propagated outputs serve as alternative imputations
rather than reconstructions of the original features, preserving utility
without compromising privacy. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis further
confirms the stability and practical applicability of MFP across diverse
scenarios. Overall, MFP provides an effective and privacy-aware framework for
graph learning in domains characterized by missing or sensitive features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论研究主要分析全批量Adam，但实践中使用的是随机版本，且随机Adam即使学习率趋近于零也不会收敛到全批量版本，这与SGD不同。需要理论解释批大小和权重衰减如何影响Adam的泛化性能。

Method: 理论分析两层过参数化CNN在图像数据上的表现，比较Adam和AdamW在不同批大小下的泛化性能，并推导有效权重衰减边界。

Result: 小批量Adam和AdamW可以取得接近零的测试误差，而全批量版本收敛到较差的解。Adam的有效权重衰减边界严格小于AdamW，解释了为什么Adam需要更敏感的权重衰减调参。

Conclusion: 批大小和权重衰减在Adam的泛化性能中起着关键作用，小批量训练可以显著改善Adam的泛化能力，而Adam比AdamW需要更精细的权重衰减调参。

Abstract: Adam is a popular and widely used adaptive gradient method in deep learning,
which has also received tremendous focus in theoretical research. However, most
existing theoretical work primarily analyzes its full-batch version, which
differs fundamentally from the stochastic variant used in practice. Unlike SGD,
stochastic Adam does not converge to its full-batch counterpart even with
infinitesimal learning rates. We present the first theoretical characterization
of how batch size affects Adam's generalization, analyzing two-layer
over-parameterized CNNs on image data. Our results reveal that while both Adam
and AdamW with proper weight decay $\lambda$ converge to poor test error
solutions, their mini-batch variants can achieve near-zero test error. We
further prove Adam has a strictly smaller effective weight decay bound than
AdamW, theoretically explaining why Adam requires more sensitive $\lambda$
tuning. Extensive experiments validate our findings, demonstrating the critical
role of batch size and weight decay in Adam's generalization performance.

Abstract: We present a systematic study of medical-domain interpretability in Large
Language Models (LLMs). We study how the LLMs both represent and process
medical knowledge through four different interpretability techniques: (1) UMAP
projections of intermediate activations, (2) gradient-based saliency with
respect to the model weights, (3) layer lesioning/removal and (4) activation
patching. We present knowledge maps of five LLMs which show, at a
coarse-resolution, where knowledge about patient's ages, medical symptoms,
diseases and drugs is stored in the models. In particular for Llama3.3-70B, we
find that most medical knowledge is processed in the first half of the model's
layers. In addition, we find several interesting phenomena: (i) age is often
encoded in a non-linear and sometimes discontinuous manner at intermediate
layers in the models, (ii) the disease progression representation is
non-monotonic and circular at certain layers of the model, (iii) in
Llama3.3-70B, drugs cluster better by medical specialty rather than mechanism
of action, especially for Llama3.3-70B and (iv) Gemma3-27B and MedGemma-27B
have activations that collapse at intermediate layers but recover by the final
layers. These results can guide future research on fine-tuning, un-learning or
de-biasing LLMs for medical tasks by suggesting at which layers in the model
these techniques should be applied.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a new learning paradigm that enables
multiple devices to collaboratively train a shared model while preserving data
privacy. However, one fundamental and prevailing challenge that hinders the
deployment of FL on mobile devices is the memory limitation. This paper
proposes \textit{FedHybrid}, a novel framework that effectively reduces the
memory footprint during the training process while guaranteeing the model
accuracy and the overall training progress. Specifically, \textit{FedHybrid}
first selects the participating devices for each training round by jointly
evaluating their memory budget, computing capability, and data diversity. After
that, it judiciously analyzes the computational graph and generates an
execution plan for each selected client in order to meet the corresponding
memory budget while minimizing the training delay through employing a hybrid of
recomputation and compression techniques according to the characteristic of
each tensor. During the local training process, \textit{FedHybrid} carries out
the execution plan with a well-designed activation compression technique to
effectively achieve memory reduction with minimum accuracy loss. We conduct
extensive experiments to evaluate \textit{FedHybrid} on both simulation and
off-the-shelf mobile devices. The experiment results demonstrate that
\textit{FedHybrid} achieves up to a 39.1\% increase in model accuracy and a
15.5$\times$ reduction in wall clock time under various memory budgets compared
with the baselines.

Abstract: The creation of systematic literature reviews (SLR) is critical for analyzing
the landscape of a research field and guiding future research directions.
However, retrieving and filtering the literature corpus for an SLR is highly
time-consuming and requires extensive manual effort, as keyword-based searches
in digital libraries often return numerous irrelevant publications. In this
work, we propose a pipeline leveraging multiple large language models (LLMs),
classifying papers based on descriptive prompts and deciding jointly using a
consensus scheme. The entire process is human-supervised and interactively
controlled via our open-source visual analytics web interface, LLMSurver, which
enables real-time inspection and modification of model outputs. We evaluate our
approach using ground-truth data from a recent SLR comprising over 8,000
candidate papers, benchmarking both open and commercial state-of-the-art LLMs
from mid-2024 and fall 2025. Results demonstrate that our pipeline
significantly reduces manual effort while achieving lower error rates than
single human annotators. Furthermore, modern open-source models prove
sufficient for this task, making the method accessible and cost-effective.
Overall, our work demonstrates how responsible human-AI collaboration can
accelerate and enhance systematic literature reviews within academic workflows.

TL;DR: 提出WearECG方法，使用变分自编码器从三个导联（II、V1、V5）重建十二导联心电图，提高可穿戴设备的心脏诊断能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 十二导联心电图是心脏诊断的金标准，但缺乏便携性；三导联系统虽便携但无法检测所有区域的心脏病变。需要一种方法能从有限的导联重建完整心电图。

Method: 使用改进的变分自编码器架构，更好地捕捉ECG信号的时空依赖性。通过MSE、MAE和FID评估生成质量，并由心脏病专家进行图灵测试验证临床有效性。

Result: 在MIMIC数据集上的实验表明，该方法能生成生理真实且具有诊断价值的信号，在下游任务中表现稳健。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了生成模型在ECG重建中的潜力，对可扩展、低成本的心脏筛查具有重要意义。

Abstract: Twelve-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) are the clinical gold standard for
cardiac diagnosis, providing comprehensive spatial coverage of the heart
necessary to detect conditions such as myocardial infarction (MI). However,
their lack of portability limits continuous and large-scale use. Three-lead ECG
systems are widely used in wearable devices due to their simplicity and
mobility, but they often fail to capture pathologies in unmeasured regions. To
address this, we propose WearECG, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) method that
reconstructs twelve-lead ECGs from three leads: II, V1, and V5. Our model
includes architectural improvements to better capture temporal and spatial
dependencies in ECG signals. We evaluate generation quality using MSE, MAE, and
Frechet Inception Distance (FID), and assess clinical validity via a Turing
test with expert cardiologists. To further validate diagnostic utility, we
fine-tune ECGFounder, a large-scale pretrained ECG model, on a multi-label
classification task involving over 40 cardiac conditions, including six
different myocardial infarction locations, using both real and generated
signals. Experiments on the MIMIC dataset show that our method produces
physiologically realistic and diagnostically informative signals, with robust
performance in downstream tasks. This work demonstrates the potential of
generative modeling for ECG reconstruction and its implications for scalable,
low-cost cardiac screening.

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一框架来分析摊销学习方法，将现有方法按摊销内容分类，并针对大规模数据集处理能力不足的问题，提出了迭代摊销推理方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代学习系统越来越多地依赖摊销学习，但现有方法在如何编码和利用任务特定信息方面存在差异，且大多数方法难以扩展到大规模数据集。

Method: 提出了一个统一框架，将摊销模型分为参数化、隐式和显式三种机制，并提出了迭代摊销推理方法，通过小批量逐步优化解决方案。

Result: 该框架为理解不同摊销学习方法提供了统一视角，迭代摊销推理方法能够更好地处理大规模数据集，弥合了基于优化的元学习与前向传递摊销之间的差距。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一个可扩展和可扩展的基础，用于通用任务适应，为摊销学习方法的发展提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Modern learning systems increasingly rely on amortized learning - the idea of
reusing computation or inductive biases shared across tasks to enable rapid
generalization to novel problems. This principle spans a range of approaches,
including meta-learning, in-context learning, prompt tuning, learned optimizers
and more. While motivated by similar goals, these approaches differ in how they
encode and leverage task-specific information, often provided as in-context
examples. In this work, we propose a unified framework which describes how such
methods differ primarily in the aspects of learning they amortize - such as
initializations, learned updates, or predictive mappings - and how they
incorporate task data at inference. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes
amortized models into parametric, implicit, and explicit regimes, based on
whether task adaptation is externalized, internalized, or jointly modeled.
Building on this view, we identify a key limitation in current approaches: most
methods struggle to scale to large datasets because their capacity to process
task data at inference (e.g., context length) is often limited. To address
this, we propose iterative amortized inference, a class of models that refine
solutions step-by-step over mini-batches, drawing inspiration from stochastic
optimization. Our formulation bridges optimization-based meta-learning with
forward-pass amortization in models like LLMs, offering a scalable and
extensible foundation for general-purpose task adaptation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DFTopK，一种新颖的可微分Top-K算子，实现了最优的O(n)时间复杂度，避免了传统方法中的排序依赖和梯度冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 级联排序在大规模信息检索系统中广泛使用，但Top-K算子不可微分，阻碍端到端训练。现有方法存在目标不一致或梯度冲突问题，且时间复杂度较高。

Method: 通过放松归一化约束，DFTopK获得了闭式解，避免了排序操作，直接构建可微分的Top-K选择算子近似。

Result: 在RecFLow基准测试和工业系统中，DFTopK显著提高了训练效率并实现了优越性能，在线A/B测试中获得了+1.77%的收入提升。

Conclusion: 这是首次将可微分Top-K算子引入推荐系统，并首次实现理论上最优的线性时间复杂度Top-K选择。

Abstract: Cascade ranking is a widely adopted paradigm in large-scale information
retrieval systems for Top-K item selection. However, the Top-K operator is
non-differentiable, hindering end-to-end training. Existing methods include
Learning-to-Rank approaches (e.g., LambdaLoss), which optimize ranking metrics
like NDCG and suffer from objective misalignment, and differentiable
sorting-based methods (e.g., ARF, LCRON), which relax permutation matrices for
direct Top-K optimization but introduce gradient conflicts through matrix
aggregation. A promising alternative is to directly construct a differentiable
approximation of the Top-K selection operator, bypassing the use of soft
permutation matrices. However, even state-of-the-art differentiable Top-K
operator (e.g., LapSum) require $O(n \log n)$ complexity due to their
dependence on sorting for solving the threshold. Thus, we propose DFTopK, a
novel differentiable Top-K operator achieving optimal $O(n)$ time complexity.
By relaxing normalization constraints, DFTopK admits a closed-form solution and
avoids sorting. DFTopK also avoids the gradient conflicts inherent in
differentiable sorting-based methods. We evaluate DFTopK on both the public
benchmark RecFLow and an industrial system. Experimental results show that
DFTopK significantly improves training efficiency while achieving superior
performance, which enables us to scale up training samples more efficiently. In
the online A/B test, DFTopK yielded a +1.77\% revenue lift with the same
computational budget compared to the baseline. To the best of our knowledge,
this work is the first to introduce differentiable Top-K operators into
recommendation systems and the first to achieve theoretically optimal
linear-time complexity for Top-K selection. We have open-sourced our
implementation to facilitate future research in both academia and industry.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种减少整数AI推理中重缩放操作成本的方法，通过后训练应用更强的量化到重缩放乘数，并引入重缩放感知训练来保持模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 整数AI推理在嵌入式系统中显著降低计算复杂度，但量化感知训练仍忽略了整数重缩放操作的影响，这在整数AI推理中是硬件成本较高的操作。

Method: 提出后训练应用更强量化到重缩放乘数的方法，并引入重缩放感知训练，对超低比特宽度的重缩放乘数进行微调。

Result: 实验表明，即使重缩放器宽度减少8倍，通过最小增量重训练仍能保持完整精度。

Conclusion: 该方法使资源受限的嵌入式系统能够实现更节能和成本效益更高的AI推理。

Abstract: Integer AI inference significantly reduces computational complexity in
embedded systems. Quantization-aware training (QAT) helps mitigate accuracy
degradation associated with post-training quantization but still overlooks the
impact of integer rescaling during inference, which is a hardware costly
operation in integer-only AI inference. This work shows that rescaling cost can
be dramatically reduced post-training, by applying a stronger quantization to
the rescale multiplicands at no model-quality loss. Furthermore, we introduce
Rescale-Aware Training, a fine tuning method for ultra-low bit-width rescaling
multiplicands. Experiments show that even with 8x reduced rescaler widths, the
full accuracy is preserved through minimal incremental retraining. This enables
more energy-efficient and cost-efficient AI inference for resource-constrained
embedded systems.

*Nikolaos Tsilivis,Eran Malach,Karen Ullrich,Julia Kempe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个理论框架，解释为什么在预训练后使用强化学习比仅使用下一个词预测能更有效地训练大语言模型进行推理任务，特别是在处理包含长短思维链的混合数据分布时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究当前神经网络在推理领域取得进展的训练范式，特别是理解为什么在下一个词预测预训练后使用强化学习能够比仅使用下一个词预测更有效地实现泛化。

Method: 提出了一个理论分析框架，研究从包含长短思维链序列的混合分布中学习。在简化设置中，理论证明了自回归线性模型能够高效学习预测d位比特的奇偶性。同时在实际设置中，对Llama系列模型在数学推理基准的混合变体上进行后训练验证。

Result: 当任务涉及预测d位比特的奇偶性且长序列稀少时，强化学习能够使自回归变换器实现泛化，而仅使用下一个词预测需要极端的统计或计算资源。理论证明只要长演示在数据混合中的比例不是输入维度d的指数级小，模型就能高效学习。

Conclusion: 强化学习通过利用增加的测试时间计算（表现为更长的响应）来促进学习过程，这一现象在多个设置中得到验证，包括Llama模型在数学推理基准上的后训练。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning domains with neural networks have primarily been
enabled by a training recipe that optimizes Large Language Models, previously
trained to predict the next-token in a sequence, with reinforcement learning
algorithms. We introduce a framework to study the success of this paradigm, and
we theoretically expose the optimization mechanisms by which reinforcement
learning improves over next-token prediction in this setting. We study learning
from mixture distributions of short and long ``chain-of-thought'' sequences
encoding a single task. In particular, when the task consists of predicting the
parity of $d$ bits and long sequences are rare, we show how reinforcement
learning after next-token prediction enables autoregressive transformers to
generalize, whereas mere next-token prediction requires extreme statistical or
computational resources to do so. We further explain how reinforcement learning
leverages increased test-time computation, manifested in longer responses, to
facilitate this learning process. In a simplified setting, we theoretically
prove that autoregressive linear models following this training recipe can
efficiently learn to predict the parity of $d$ bits as long as the proportion
of long demonstrations in the data mix is not exponentially small in the input
dimension $d$. Finally, we demonstrate these same phenomena in other settings,
including the post-training of Llama-series models on mixture variations of
common mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: GTPs通过统一的ODE视角成功弥合了生成策略在计算效率与性能之间的差距，为离线RL提供了更通用的策略范式。

Abstract: Generative models have emerged as a powerful class of policies for offline
reinforcement learning (RL) due to their ability to capture complex,
multi-modal behaviors. However, existing methods face a stark trade-off: slow,
iterative models like diffusion policies are computationally expensive, while
fast, single-step models like consistency policies often suffer from degraded
performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to bridge this
gap. The key to moving beyond the limitations of individual methods, we argue,
lies in a unifying perspective that views modern generative models, including
diffusion, flow matching, and consistency models, as specific instances of
learning a continuous-time generative trajectory governed by an Ordinary
Differential Equation (ODE). This principled foundation provides a clearer
design space for generative policies in RL and allows us to propose Generative
Trajectory Policies (GTPs), a new and more general policy paradigm that learns
the entire solution map of the underlying ODE. To make this paradigm practical
for offline RL, we further introduce two key theoretically principled
adaptations. Empirical results demonstrate that GTP achieves state-of-the-art
performance on D4RL benchmarks - it significantly outperforms prior generative
policies, achieving perfect scores on several notoriously hard AntMaze tasks.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles have shown promising potential to be a groundbreaking
technology for improving the safety of road users. For these vehicles, as well
as many other safety-critical robotic technologies, to be deployed in
real-world applications, we require algorithms that can generalize well to
unseen scenarios and data. Model-based reinforcement learning algorithms (MBRL)
have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance and data efficiency across a
diverse set of domains. However, these algorithms have also shown
susceptibility to changes in the environment and its transition dynamics.
  In this work, we explore the performance and generalization capabilities of
MBRL algorithms for autonomous driving, specifically in the simulated
autonomous racing environment, Roboracer (formerly F1Tenth). We frame the
head-to-head racing task as a learning problem using contextual Markov decision
processes and parameterize the driving behavior of the adversaries using the
context of the episode, thereby also parameterizing the transition and reward
dynamics. We benchmark the behavior of MBRL algorithms in this environment and
propose a novel context-aware extension of the existing literature, cMask. We
demonstrate that context-aware MBRL algorithms generalize better to
out-of-distribution adversary behaviors relative to context-free approaches. We
also demonstrate that cMask displays strong generalization capabilities, as
well as further performance improvement relative to other context-aware MBRL
approaches when racing against adversaries with in-distribution behaviors.

Conclusion: MISTAKE方法能够有效建模错误推理模式，在教育应用中的学生模拟、误解分类和答案生成任务上表现优异，为教育技术提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Research on reasoning in language models (LMs) predominantly focuses on
improving the correctness of their outputs. But some important applications
require modeling reasoning patterns that are incorrect. For example, automated
systems that can reason about and simulate student errors are useful for
providing real-time feedback in the classroom or offline practice for
educators-in-training. This paper presents a new method, MISTAKE, that (1)
constructs high-quality synthetic examples of reasoning errors by leveraging
cycle consistency between incorrect answers and latent misconceptions; and (2)
uses the generated data to learn models for student simulation, misconception
classification, and answer generation. We evaluate MISTAKE on three educational
tasks and find that it results in (1) higher accuracy when simulating incorrect
student answers based on specific misconceptions, (2) increased performance
inferring latent misconceptions from observed incorrect answers, and (3) higher
alignment with expert-written distractor answers when generating incorrect
answers (e.g., for multiple-choice tests).

Abstract: Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a critical role in the land-atmosphere
interactions, yet its accurate quantification across various spatiotemporal
scales remains a challenge. In situ measurement approaches, like eddy
covariance (EC) or weather station-based ET estimation, allow for measuring ET
at a single location. Agricultural uses of ET require estimates for each field
over broad areas, making it infeasible to deploy sensing systems at each
location. This study integrates tree-based and knowledge-guided machine
learning (ML) techniques with multispectral remote sensing data, griddled
meteorology and EC data to upscale ET across the Midwest United States. We
compare four tree-based models - Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM -
and a simple feed-forward artificial neural network in combination with
features engineered using knowledge-guided ML principles. Models were trained
and tested on EC towers located in the Midwest of the United States using
k-fold cross validation with k=5 and site-year, biome stratified train-test
split to avoid data leakage. Results show that LightGBM with knowledge-guided
features outperformed other methods with an R2=0.86, MSE=14.99 W m^-2 and MAE =
8.82 W m^-2 according to grouped k-fold validation (k=5). Feature importance
analysis shows that knowledge-guided features were most important for
predicting evapotranspiration. Using the best performing model, we provide a
data product at 500 m spatial and one-day temporal resolution for gridded ET
for the period of 2019-2024. Intercomparison between the new gridded product
and state-level weather station-based ET estimates show best-in-class
correspondence.

Motivation: 多跳问题需要识别多个知识目标来合成答案，现有RAG方法难以理解复杂语义结构，且在检索多个信息目标时容易受到无关噪声的影响。

Conclusion: 提出的图表示学习框架能有效提升多跳问题检索性能，通过多粒度信息聚合和噪声抑制机制显著改善复杂语义理解能力。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated its ability to enhance
Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources.
However, multi-hop questions, which require the identification of multiple
knowledge targets to form a synthesized answer, raise new challenges for RAG
systems. Under the multi-hop settings, existing methods often struggle to fully
understand the questions with complex semantic structures and are susceptible
to irrelevant noise during the retrieval of multiple information targets. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel graph representation learning
framework for multi-hop question retrieval. We first introduce a
Multi-information Level Knowledge Graph (Multi-L KG) to model various
information levels for a more comprehensive understanding of multi-hop
questions. Based on this, we design a Query-Specific Graph Neural Network
(QSGNN) for representation learning on the Multi-L KG. QSGNN employs
intra/inter-level message passing mechanisms, and in each message passing the
information aggregation is guided by the query, which not only facilitates
multi-granular information aggregation but also significantly reduces the
impact of noise. To enhance its ability to learn robust representations, we
further propose two synthesized data generation strategies for pre-training the
QSGNN. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework in multi-hop scenarios, especially in high-hop questions the
improvement can reach 33.8\%. The code is available at:

Result: 实证表明扩散DFL方法在决策质量上始终优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 扩散模型为决策聚焦学习提供了有效的概率建模框架，通过评分函数近似实现了高效训练，显著提升了决策性能。

Abstract: Decision-focused learning (DFL) integrates predictive modeling and
optimization by training predictors to optimize the downstream decision target
rather than merely minimizing prediction error. To date, existing DFL methods
typically rely on deterministic point predictions, which are often insufficient
to capture the intrinsic stochasticity of real-world environments. To address
this challenge, we propose the first diffusion-based DFL approach, which trains
a diffusion model to represent the distribution of uncertain parameters and
optimizes the decision by solving a stochastic optimization with samples drawn
from the diffusion model. Our contributions are twofold. First, we formulate
diffusion DFL using the reparameterization trick, enabling end-to-end training
through diffusion. While effective, it is memory and compute-intensive due to
the need to differentiate through the diffusion sampling process. Second, we
propose a lightweight score function estimator that uses only several forward
diffusion passes and avoids backpropagation through the sampling. This follows
from our results that backpropagating through stochastic optimization can be
approximated by a weighted score function formulation. We empirically show that
our diffusion DFL approach consistently outperforms strong baselines in
decision quality. The source code for all experiments is available at the
project repository: https://github.com/GT-KOALA/Diffusion_DFL.

Abstract: Statistical arbitrage exploits temporal price differences between similar
assets. We develop a framework to jointly identify similar assets through
factors, identify mispricing and form a trading policy that maximizes
risk-adjusted performance after trading costs. Our Attention Factors are
conditional latent factors that are the most useful for arbitrage trading. They
are learned from firm characteristic embeddings that allow for complex
interactions. We identify time-series signals from the residual portfolios of
our factors with a general sequence model. Estimating factors and the arbitrage
trading strategy jointly is crucial to maximize profitability after trading
costs. In a comprehensive empirical study we show that our Attention Factor
model achieves an out-of-sample Sharpe ratio above 4 on the largest U.S.
equities over a 24-year period. Our one-step solution yields an unprecedented
Sharpe ratio of 2.3 net of transaction costs. We show that weak factors are
important for arbitrage trading.

### [675] [MATH-Beyond: A Benchmark for RL to Expand Beyond the Base Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11653)
*Prasanna Mayilvahanan,Ricardo Dominguez-Olmedo,Thaddäus Wiedemer,Wieland Brendel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文指出当前强化学习微调方法主要在强化现有解题模式而非发现新方法，为此提出了MATH-B基准测试来挑战现有模型，推动探索驱动的强化学习方法发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在数学推理任务中主要是在强化基础模型已有的解题能力，而非真正探索新的推理方式，这限制了模型能力的突破。

Method: 构建了MATH-B基准测试，该测试专门设计来击败常见开源模型（最高8B参数），即使在大规模采样下也难以解决。问题来源于DAPO-Math-17K和DeepScaleR数据集。

Result: 验证了现有强化学习微调模型（如Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B和DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview）在MATH-B基准测试上表现不佳，即使在pass@1024采样下也无法解决这些问题。

Conclusion: MATH-B基准测试将推动探索驱动的强化学习方法发展，激发更深的推理能力，超越现有方法的局限。

Abstract: With the advent of DeepSeek-R1, a new wave of reinforcement learning (RL)
methods has emerged that seem to unlock stronger mathematical reasoning.
However, a closer look at the open-source ecosystem reveals a critical
limitation: with sufficiently many draws (e.g., $\texttt{pass@1024}$), many
existing base models already solve nearly all questions on widely used math
benchmarks such as MATH-500 and AIME 2024. This suggests that the RL
fine-tuning methods prevalent in the LLM reasoning literature largely sharpen
existing solution modes rather than discovering entirely new ones. Such
sharpening stands in contrast to the broader promise of RL: to foster
exploration and to acquire new skills. To move beyond this plateau, we
introduce MATH-Beyond (MATH-B), a benchmark deliberately constructed to defeat
common open-source models of up to 8B parameters even under large sampling
budgets. Improving performance on our benchmark via RL requires methods that
learn to reason in ways that go beyond base model capabilities in repeated
sampling. Since the problems are drawn from subsets of DAPO-Math-17K and
DeepScaleR datasets, they remain topically equivalent to standard high-school
math. Validating our premise, RL fine-tuned models such as
Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B and DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview perform
poorly on MATH-B at $\texttt{pass@1024}$, showing how existing approaches fall
short on tackling harder instances. We hope MATH-B will catalyze
exploration-driven RL approaches that elicit deeper reasoning capabilities. We
release MATH-B at https://huggingface.co/datasets/brendel-group/MATH-Beyond.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了动态测度传输用于生成建模，特别关注由连接指定源分布和目标分布的随机过程诱导的流。作者提供了直线流（点加速度为零）的PDE特征，并完全刻画了仿射时间插值过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究哪些随机过程能产生直线流，这种流的点加速度为零，可以用一阶方法精确积分，从而简化生成建模中的传输过程。

Method: 通过分析随机过程的期望速度场，推导出直线流的PDE特征：条件加速度与加权协方差（雷诺）张量散度之间的平衡。完全刻画了仿射时间插值过程。

Result: 发现直线流恰好出现在确定性端点耦合情况下。推导了约束一般过程流几何的必要条件，为设计更易积分的传输提供了广泛指导。

Conclusion: 该研究为设计易于积分的动态测度传输提供了理论基础，特别强调了确定性端点耦合在产生直线流中的关键作用。

Abstract: We study dynamic measure transport for generative modeling: specifically,
flows induced by stochastic processes that bridge a specified source and target
distribution. The conditional expectation of the process' velocity defines an
ODE whose flow map achieves the desired transport. We ask \emph{which processes
produce straight-line flows} -- i.e., flows whose pointwise acceleration
vanishes and thus are exactly integrable with a first-order method? We provide
a concise PDE characterization of straightness as a balance between conditional
acceleration and the divergence of a weighted covariance (Reynolds) tensor.
Using this lens, we fully characterize affine-in-time interpolants and show
that straightness occurs exactly under deterministic endpoint couplings. We
also derive necessary conditions that constrain flow geometry for general
processes, offering broad guidance for designing transports that are easier to
integrate.

TL;DR: 提出了一系列时间一致、遵循指令的大语言模型，通过明确的知识截止日期来消除前瞻性偏差，提供可复现的预测工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 消除大语言模型预测任务中的前瞻性偏差，确保模型训练数据严格限定在特定时间点之前，避免未来信息泄露。

Method: 训练仅在明确知识截止日期前可用数据上训练的指令遵循大语言模型，确保严格的时间分离和固定的模型权重。

Result: 开发了一个简单对话界面、完全开放且权重固定的模型框架，为预测任务提供了无前瞻性偏差的生成式AI工具。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究人员提供了易于使用的生成式AI工具，能够隔离训练数据泄露后的可预测性，确保预测结果的保守下界准确性。

Abstract: We introduce a family of chronologically consistent, instruction-following
large language models to eliminate lookahead bias. Each model is trained only
on data available before a clearly defined knowledge-cutoff date, ensuring
strict temporal separation from any post-cutoff data. The resulting framework
offers (i) a simple, conversational chat interface, (ii) fully open, fixed
model weights that guarantee replicability, and (iii) a conservative lower
bound on forecast accuracy, isolating the share of predictability that survives
once training leakage is removed. Together, these features provide researchers
with an easy-to-use generative AI tool useful for a wide range of prediction
tasks that is free of lookahead bias.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在语言模型强化学习中引入基于表示的多样性探索奖励，发现在推理时和训练后都能显著提高多样性和性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究强化学习是否真正促进语言模型发现新行为，还是仅仅优化已有行为，探索预训练模型知识如何指导搜索过程。

Method: 使用基于预训练语言模型隐藏状态的表示多样性奖励，在推理时和训练后阶段进行有意识的探索。

Result: 基于表示的多样性探索显著提高了多样性和pass@k率，在推理时提升验证器效率达50%以上，在训练后实现3倍的测试时样本效率提升。

Conclusion: 有意识的探索配合正确的多样性概念是发现新行为的实用路径，超越了单纯的性能优化。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to expand the capabilities of language
models, but it is unclear if current RL techniques promote the discovery of
novel behaviors, or simply sharpen those already present in the base model. In
this paper, we investigate the value of deliberate exploration -- explicitly
incentivizing the model to discover novel and diverse behaviors -- and aim to
understand how the knowledge in pre-trained models can guide this search. Our
main finding is that exploration with a simple, principled,
representation-based bonus derived from the pre-trained language model's hidden
states significantly improves diversity and pass@k rates -- both for
post-training, and in a novel inference-time scaling setting we introduce. For
inference-time, exploration with representation-based diversity improves
efficiency, consistently improving pass@k rates across a variety of models and
reasoning tasks. For example, for Qwen-2.5-14b-Instruct we obtain over 50%
improvement in verifier efficiency on almost all tasks. For post-training, we
show that integrating this exploration strategy into an RL pipeline improves
reasoning performance over that of the initial model and over standard RL
post-training. For example, on AIME 2024, our post-trained
Qwen-2.5-7b-Instruct's pass@80 matches the pass@256 of GRPO on the same model,
demonstrating a 3x improvement in test-time sample efficiency. Overall, our
findings suggest that deliberate exploration -- with the right notion of
diversity -- is a practical path toward discovery of new behaviors beyond
sharpening.

TL;DR: 本文研究了乐观Hedge算法在二人零和博弈中的遗憾最优性，改进了现有的遗憾上界至O(√(log m log n))，并提供了匹配的算法相关下界，证明了这些上界无法进一步改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究乐观Hedge算法在强非耦合学习动态中的遗憾最优性，特别是对动作数量m和n的依赖关系是否最优。

Method: 通过将遗憾上界表达为关于学习率和某些负项系数的优化问题，进行精细分析；提供算法相关的个体遗憾下界来证明上界的紧致性。

Result: 在强非耦合设置下，将社会和个体遗憾上界改进为O(√(log m log n))；证明了这些上界无法进一步改进，且社会遗憾的上下界在主导项常数上完全匹配。

Conclusion: 乐观Hedge算法的遗憾上界在动作数量依赖关系上是最优的；基于这些结果改进了最后迭代收敛率和动态遗憾，并提供了匹配的动态遗憾下界。

Abstract: In two-player zero-sum games, the learning dynamic based on optimistic Hedge
achieves one of the best-known regret upper bounds among strongly-uncoupled
learning dynamics. With an appropriately chosen learning rate, the social and
individual regrets can be bounded by $O(\log(mn))$ in terms of the numbers of
actions $m$ and $n$ of the two players. This study investigates the optimality
of the dependence on $m$ and $n$ in the regret of optimistic Hedge. To this
end, we begin by refining existing regret analysis and show that, in the
strongly-uncoupled setting where the opponent's number of actions is known,
both the social and individual regret bounds can be improved to $O(\sqrt{\log m
\log n})$. In this analysis, we express the regret upper bound as an
optimization problem with respect to the learning rates and the coefficients of
certain negative terms, enabling refined analysis of the leading constants. We
then show that the existing social regret bound as well as these new social and
individual regret upper bounds cannot be further improved for optimistic Hedge
by providing algorithm-dependent individual regret lower bounds. Importantly,
these social regret upper and lower bounds match exactly including the constant
factor in the leading term. Finally, building on these results, we improve the
last-iterate convergence rate and the dynamic regret of a learning dynamic
based on optimistic Hedge, and complement these bounds with algorithm-dependent
dynamic regret lower bounds that match the improved bounds.

### [680] [Adversarial Attacks Leverage Interference Between Features in Superposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11709)
*Edward Stevinson,Lucas Prieto,Melih Barsbey,Tolga Birdal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出对抗性漏洞源于神经网络中的高效信息编码机制，特别是叠加现象——网络用少于特征数量的维度表示更多特征，这种表示安排被攻击者利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨对抗性样本产生的根本原因，现有观点将其归因于决策边界的不规则性或对非鲁棒特征的敏感性，而本文认为对抗性漏洞源自神经网络的高效信息编码。

Method: 通过分析叠加现象中潜在表示的排列方式，研究对抗性扰动如何利用叠加特征间的干扰；在精确控制叠加的合成环境中验证假设，并在CIFAR-10上训练的ViT中进行验证。

Result: 发现对抗性扰动利用叠加特征间的干扰，攻击模式可从特征排列中预测；叠加足以产生对抗性漏洞；这些发现在ViT模型中得到验证。

Conclusion: 对抗性漏洞可能是网络表示压缩的副产品，而非学习过程缺陷或非鲁棒输入的问题。

Abstract: Fundamental questions remain about when and why adversarial examples arise in
neural networks, with competing views characterising them either as artifacts
of the irregularities in the decision landscape or as products of sensitivity
to non-robust input features. In this paper, we instead argue that adversarial
vulnerability can stem from efficient information encoding in neural networks.
Specifically, we show how superposition - where networks represent more
features than they have dimensions - creates arrangements of latent
representations that adversaries can exploit. We demonstrate that adversarial
perturbations leverage interference between superposed features, making attack
patterns predictable from feature arrangements. Our framework provides a
mechanistic explanation for two known phenomena: adversarial attack
transferability between models with similar training regimes and class-specific
vulnerability patterns. In synthetic settings with precisely controlled
superposition, we establish that superposition suffices to create adversarial
vulnerability. We then demonstrate that these findings persist in a ViT trained
on CIFAR-10. These findings reveal adversarial vulnerability can be a byproduct
of networks' representational compression, rather than flaws in the learning
process or non-robust inputs.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合摊销方法和粒子方法的新采样框架，通过连接序列蒙特卡洛和最大熵强化学习来训练神经采样器，在合成多模态目标和生物分子构象分布上表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有采样方法在复杂分布上存在局限性，需要结合摊销采样的效率和粒子方法的探索能力，以更好地近似难以归一化的密度函数。

Method: 建立SMC与神经序列采样器的连接，使用最大熵强化学习训练采样策略，引入离策略训练、稳定联合训练技术、自适应权重退火方案，以及结合历史样本的经验回放方法。

Result: 在连续和离散空间的多模态目标以及丙氨酸二肽构象的玻尔兹曼分布上，相比传统摊销方法和蒙特卡洛方法，该方法在近似真实分布和训练稳定性方面都有显著改进。

Conclusion: 通过连接SMC和神经采样器，结合强化学习技术，提出了一种更有效和稳定的采样方法，能够更好地处理复杂分布采样问题。

Abstract: This paper proposes a synergy of amortised and particle-based methods for
sampling from distributions defined by unnormalised density functions. We state
a connection between sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and neural sequential
samplers trained by maximum-entropy reinforcement learning (MaxEnt RL), wherein
learnt sampling policies and value functions define proposal kernels and twist
functions. Exploiting this connection, we introduce an off-policy RL training
procedure for the sampler that uses samples from SMC -- using the learnt
sampler as a proposal -- as a behaviour policy that better explores the target
distribution. We describe techniques for stable joint training of proposals and
twist functions and an adaptive weight tempering scheme to reduce training
signal variance. Furthermore, building upon past attempts to use experience
replay to guide the training of neural samplers, we derive a way to combine
historical samples with annealed importance sampling weights within a replay
buffer. On synthetic multi-modal targets (in both continuous and discrete
spaces) and the Boltzmann distribution of alanine dipeptide conformations, we
demonstrate improvements in approximating the true distribution as well as
training stability compared to both amortised and Monte Carlo methods.

Motivation: 处理具有复杂海岸线和海底地形影响的时空温度张量中的大量缺失值问题，探索高效的压缩方法。

Method: 使用标准SVD压缩方法（包括Tucker、张量链和量化张量链格式），提出贪婪空间数据分区算法将数据划分为更小子张量，并发现两天时间分区是最优策略。

Result: 标准张量压缩方法效果显著，空间和时间分区策略结合后在整个数据集上实现了5倍的稳健压缩比。

Conclusion: 标准SVD压缩方法对含缺失值的时空温度张量有效，结合空间和时间分区策略可显著提升压缩性能。

Abstract: In this work we investigate efficient data compression for spatiotemporal
Black, Azov and Marmara Seas temperature tensors that contain significant
number of missing values. These tensors have a complex structure influenced by
the coastlines and bathymetry, as well as temporal temperature changes. While
such missing data typically provokes utilization of tensor completion
algorithms, we demonstrate that standard SVD-based compression approaches
(including the Tucker, Tensor-Train (TT) and Quantized-TT formats) are
remarkably effective and yield comparable results. We propose a greedy spatial
data partitioning algorithm enhancing their performance. We divide the data
into the smaller subtensors before compression via exploitation of this trick.
  Furthermore, our analysis reveals a strong temporal dependency in the data's
compressibility caused by its nature. Fixing the level of precision we observe
a significant seasonal variation. Investigating this, we find that a temporal
partitioning on a scale of approximately two days is nearly optimal for all
tested tensor based formats. The combined application of these spatial and
temporal strategies with tensor methods ultimately achieves a robust
compression ratio of 5 times across the entire dataset.

Motivation: 传统地理科学软件中的交点计算公式在速度和数值鲁棒性方面存在不足，需要开发既快速又高精度的算法来满足高性能应用（如高分辨率气候数据重网格化）的需求。

Method: 首先提出简化的交点计算公式，然后应用误差自由变换（EFT）技术来评估该公式，实现向量化和并行化实现，确保在硬件浮点计算速度下达到高精度。

Result: 该算法在保持与硬件浮点直接计算相同计算时间的同时，实现了接近机器精度的相对误差边界，而使用四倍精度、任意精度或CGAL库的替代方案会导致显著的计算开销。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了如何将EFT技术结合和扩展来实现非平凡几何计算的高精度和高速度，为性能敏感应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a fast, high-precision algorithm for calculating intersections
between great circle arcs and lines of constant latitude on the unit sphere. We
first propose a simplified intersection point formula with improved speed and
numerical robustness over the ones traditionally implemented in geoscience
software. We then show how algorithms based on the concept of error-free
transformations (EFT) can be applied to evaluate this formula within a relative
error bound that is on the order of machine precision. We demonstrate that,
with a vectorized and parallelized implementation, this enhanced accuracy is
achieved with no compute-time overhead compared to a direct calculation in
hardware floating point, making our algorithm suitable for
performance-sensitive applications like regridding of high-resolution climate
data. In contrast, evaluating our formula using high-precision data types like
quadruple precision and arbitrary precision, or using the robust intersection
computation routines from the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL),
leads to significant computational overhead, especially since these
alternatives inhibit vectorization. More generally, our work demonstrates how
EFT techniques can be combined and extended to implement nontrivial geometric
calculations with high accuracy and speed.

results in the case of the sphere and a generic ellipsoid.

Abstract: We study the following nonlinear heat equation with damping and pumping
effects (a reaction-diffusion equation) posed on a bounded simply connected
convex domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, $d \geq 1$ with Lipschitz boundary
$\partial\Omega$: $$ \frac{\partial u(t)}{\partial t} - \nu \Delta u(t) +
\alpha |u(t)|^{p-2}u(t) - \sum_{\ell=1}^M \beta_{\ell} |u(t)|^{q_{\ell}-2}u(t)
= f(t), \quad t>0, $$ subject to homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions and
the initial condition $u(0)=u_0$, where $2 \leq p < \infty$ and $2 \leq
q_{\ell} < p$ for $1 \leq \ell \leq M$. For $u_0 \in L^2(\Omega)$ and $f \in
L^2(0,T;H^{-1}(\Omega))$, we establish the existence and uniqueness of a weak
solution for all dimensions $d \in \mathbb{N}$ and damping exponents $2 \leq p
< \infty$. Furthermore, for $u_0 \in H^2(\Omega) \cap H_0^1(\Omega)$ and $f \in
H^1(0,T;H^1(\Omega))$, we obtain regularity results: these hold for every $2
\leq p < \infty$ when $1 \leq d \leq 4$, and for $2 \leq p \leq
\frac{2d-6}{d-4}$ when $d \geq 5$. We further conduct finite element analysis
using conforming, nonconforming, and discontinuous Galerkin methods, deriving a
priori error estimates for both semi- and fully discrete schemes, supported by
numerical results. To relax restrictions on $p$ in the semidiscrete analysis,
we use appropriate projection/interpolation operators: the Ritz projection in
the conforming case ($2 \le p \le \frac{2d}{d-2}$), the Scott-Zhang
interpolation for $\frac{2d}{d-2} < p \le \frac{2d-6}{d-4}$, the Cl\'ement
interpolation in the nonconforming setting, and the $L^2$-projection in the DG
framework. In the fully discrete case, error estimates hold for the above
$p$-range under $u_0 \in D(A^{3/2})$ and $f \in H^1(0,T;H^1(\Omega))$.

Abstract: In this paper, a second-order linearized discontinuous Galerkin method on
general meshes, which treats the backward differentiation formula of order two
(BDF2) and Crank-Nicolson schemes as special cases, is proposed for solving the
two-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau equations with cubic nonlinearity. By utilizing
the discontinuous Galerkin inverse inequality and the mathematical induction
method, the unconditionally optimal error estimate in $L^2$-norm is obtained.
The core of the analysis in this paper resides in the classification and
discussion of the relationship between the temporal step size and the spatial
step size, specifically distinguishing between the two scenarios of tau^2 \leq
h^{k+1}$and$\tau^2 > h^{k+1}$, where$k$denotes the degree of the discrete
spatial scheme. Finally, this paper presents two numerical examples involving
various grids and polynomial degrees to verify the correctness of the
theoretical results.

Abstract: Operator learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for approximating
solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs) and other
functional mappings. \textcolor{red}{}{Classical approaches} typically adopt a
pointwise-to-pointwise framework, where input functions are sampled at
prescribed locations and mapped directly to solution values. We propose the
Fixed-Basis Coefficient to Coefficient Operator Network (FB-C2CNet), which
learns operators in the coefficient space induced by prescribed basis
functions. In this framework, the input function is projected onto a fixed set
of basis functions (e.g., random features or finite element bases), and the
neural operator predicts the coefficients of the solution function in the same
or another basis. By decoupling basis selection from network training,
FB-C2CNet reduces training complexity, enables systematic analysis of how basis
choice affects approximation accuracy, and clarifies what properties of
coefficient spaces (such as effective rank and coefficient variations) are
critical for generalization. Numerical experiments on Darcy flow, Poisson
equations in regular, complex, and high-dimensional domains, and elasticity
problems demonstrate that FB-C2CNet achieves high accuracy and computational
efficiency, showing its strong potential for practical operator learning tasks.

Abstract: The semi-implicit (partly decoupled, also called staggered or fraction-step)
time discretization is applied to compressible nonlinear dynamical models of
viscoelastic solids in the Eulerian description, i.e.\ in the actual deforming
configuration, formulated fully in terms of rates. The Kelvin-Voigt rheology
and also, in the deviatoric part, the Jeffreys rheology are considered. The
numerical stability and, considering the Stokes-type viscosity multipolar of
the 2nd-grade, also convergence towards weak solutions are proved in
three-dimensional situations, exploiting the convexity of the kinetic energy
when written in terms of linear momentum. No (poly)convexity of the stored
energy is required and some enhancements (specifically towards damage and
diffusion models) are briefly outlined, too.

Abstract: Dealing with zero singular values can be quite challenging, as they have the
potential to cause numerous numerical difficulties. This paper presents a
method for computing the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a nonnegative
bidiagonal product of arbitrary rank, regardless of whether the factors are of
full rank or rank-deficient, square or rectangular. A key feature of our method
is its ability to exactly deflate all zero singular values with a favorable
complexity, irrespective of rank deficiency and ill conditioning. Furthermore,
it ensures the computation of nonzero singular values, no matter how small they
may be, with high relative accuracy. Additionally, our method is well-suited
for accurately computing the SVDs of arbitrary submatrices, leveraging an
approach to extract their representations from the original product. We have
conducted error analysis and numerical experiments to validate the claimed high
relative accuracy.

Conclusion: 成功开发了高阶DG-HGKS方案，突破了现有单阶段方案的三阶精度限制，为可压缩流动模拟提供了更精确的数值方法。

Abstract: In this paper, a uniformly high-order discontinuous Galerkin gas kinetic
scheme (DG-HGKS) is proposed to solve the Euler equations of compressible
flows. The new scheme is an extension of the one-stage compact and efficient
high-order GKS (CEHGKS, Li et al. , 2021. J. Comput. Phys. 447, 110661) in the
finite volume framework. The main ideas of the new scheme consist of two parts.
Firstly, starting from a fully discrete DG formulation, the numerical fluxes
and volume integrals are expanded in time. Secondly, the time derivatives are
replaced by spatial derivatives using the techniques in CEHGKS. To suppress the
non-physical oscillations in the discontinuous regions while minimizing the
number of "troubled cells", an effective limiter strategy compatible with the
new scheme has been developed by combining the KXRCF indicator and the SHWENO
reconstruction technique. The new scheme can achieve arbitrary high-order
accuracy in both space and time, thereby breaking the previous limitation of no
more than third-order accuracy in existing one-stage DG-HGKS schemes. Numerical
tests in 1D and 2D have demonstrated the robustness and effectiveness of the
scheme.

Abstract: This paper develops novel natural superconvergence and ultraconvergence
structures for the bi-$k$-order finite volume element (FVE) method on
rectangular meshes. These structures furnish tunable and possibly asymmetric
superconvergence and ultraconvergence points. We achieve one-order-higher
superconvergence for both derivatives and function values, and
two-orders-higher ultraconvergence for derivatives--a phenomenon that standard
bi-$k$-order finite elements do not exhibit. Derivative ultraconvergence
requires three conditions: a diagonal diffusion tensor, zero convection
coefficients, and the FVE scheme satisfying tensorial $k$-$k$-order
orthogonality (imposed via dual mesh constraints). This two-dimensional
derivative ultraconvergence is not a trivial tensor-product extension of the
one-dimensional phenomena; its analysis is also considerably more complex due
to directional coupling. Theoretically, we introduce the asymmetric-enabled
M-decompositions (AMD-Super and AMD-Ultra) to rigorously prove these phenomena.
Numerical experiments confirm the theory.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the well-posedness of a nonlinear dispersive
model with variable coefficients that describes the evolution of surface waves
propagating through a one-dimensional shallow water channel of finite length

utilize the numerical solver developed by the authors in \cite{PizoMunoz} to
approximate solutions of the model on a finite spatial interval, considering
various parameter values and forms of the variable coefficients in the
Boussinesq system under study. Additionally, we present preliminary numerical
experiments addressing an inverse problem: the reconstruction of the initial
wave elevation and fluid velocity from measurements taken at a final time. This
is achieved by formulating an optimization problem in which the initial
conditions are estimated as minimizers of a functional that quantifies the
discrepancy between the observed final state and the numerical solution evolved
from a trial initial state.

Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient algorithm for solving the Hartree--Fock
equation combining a multilevel correction scheme with an adaptive refinement
technique to improve computational efficiency. The algorithm integrates a
multilevel correction framework with an optimized implementation strategy.
Within this framework, a series of linearized boundary value problems are
solved, and their approximate solutions are corrected by solving small-scale
Hartree--Fock equations in low-dimensional correction spaces. The correction
space comprises a coarse space and the solution to the linearized boundary
value problem, enabling high accuracy while preserving low-dimensional
characteristics. The proposed algorithm efficiently addresses the inherent
computational complexity of the Hartree--Fock equation. Innovative correction
strategies eliminate the need for direct computation of large-scale nonlinear
eigenvalue systems and dense matrix operations. Furthermore, optimization
techniques based on precomputations within the correction space render the
total computational workload nearly independent of the number of
self-consistent field iterations. This approach significantly accelerates the
solution process of the Hartree--Fock equation, effectively mitigating the
traditional exponential scaling demands on computational resources while
maintaining precision.

Abstract: We present multiscale graph-based reduction algorithms for upscaling
heterogeneous and anisotropic diffusion problems. The proposed coarsening
approaches begin by constructing a partitioning of the computational domain
into a set of balanced local subdomains, resulting in a standard type of domain
decomposition. Given this initial decomposition, general coarsening techniques
based on spectral clustering are applied within each subgraph in order to
accurately identify the key microscopic features of a given system. The
spectral clustering algorithm is based on local generalized
eigen-decompositions applied to the signed graph Laplacian. The resulting
coarse-fine splittings are combined with two variants of energy-minimizing
strategies for constructing coarse bases for diffusion problems. The first is
an unconstrained minimization formulation in which local harmonic extensions
are applied column-wise to construct multi-vector preserving interpolation in
each region, whereas the second approach is a variant of the constrained energy
minimization formulations derived in the context of non-local multi-continua
upscaling techniques. We apply the resulting upscaling algorithms to a variety
of tests coming from the graph Laplacian, including diffusion in the perforated
domain, channelized media, highly anisotropic settings, and discrete pore
network models to demonstrate the potential and robustness of the proposed
coarsening approaches. We show numerically and theoretically that the proposed
approaches lead to accurate coarse-scale models.

Abstract: Recently, multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization (MFBO) has been successfully
applied to many engineering design optimization problems, where the cost of
high-fidelity simulations and experiments can be prohibitive. However,
challenges remain for constrained optimization problems using the MFBO
framework, particularly in efficiently identifying the feasible region defined
by the constraints. In this paper, we propose a constrained multi-fidelity
Bayesian optimization (CMFBO) method with novel acquisition functions.
Specifically, we design efficient acquisition functions that 1) have
analytically closed-form expressions; 2) are straightforward to implement; and
3) do not require feasible initial samples, an important feature often missing
in commonly used acquisition functions such as expected constrained improvement
(ECI). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on synthetic test
problems using different combinations of acquisition functions. Then, we apply
the proposed method to a data-driven inertial confinement fusion (ICF) design
problem, and a high-current joint design problem using finite element
simulations with computational contact mechanics.

Abstract: We consider the initial-boundary value problem for a quasilinear
time-fractional diffusion equation, and develop a fully discrete solver
combining the parareal algorithm in time with a L1 finite-difference
approximation of the Caputo derivative and a spectral Galerkin discretization
in space. Our main contribution is the first rigorous convergence proof for the
parareal-L1 scheme in this nonlinear subdiffusive setting. By constructing
suitable energy norms and exploiting the orthogonality of the spectral basis,
we establish that the parareal iterations converge exactly to the fully serial
L1-spectral solution in a finite number of steps, with rates independent of the
fractional exponent. The spectral spatial discretization yields exponential
accuracy in space, while the parareal structure induces a clock speedup
proportional to the number of processors, making the overall method highly
efficient. Numerical experiments for both subdiffusive and classical diffusion
problems confirm our theoretical estimates and demonstrate up to an order of
magnitude reduction in computational time compared to the conventional
sequential solver. We observe that the speedup of the parareal method increases
linearly with the fine integrator degrees of freedom.

Abstract: The computation of sparse solutions of large-scale linear discrete ill-posed
problems remains a computationally demanding task. A powerful framework in this
context is the use of iteratively reweighted schemes, which are based on
constructing a sequence of quadratic tangent majorants of the $\ell_2$-$\ell_1$
regularization functional (with additional smoothing to ensure
differentiability at the origin), and solving them successively. Recently,
flexible Krylov-Tikhonov methods have been used to partially solve each problem
in the sequence efficiently. However, in order to guarantee convergence, the
complexity of the algorithm at each iteration increases with respect to more
traditional methods. We propose a randomized flexible Krylov method to
alleviate the increase of complexity, which leverages the adaptability of the
flexible Krylov subspaces with the efficiency of `sketch-and-solve' methods. A
possible caveat of the mentioned methods is their memory requirements. In this
case, one needs to rely instead on inner-outer schemes. In these scenarios, we
propose a `sketch-to-precondition' method to speed up the convergence of each
of the subproblems in the sequence. The performance of these algorithms is
shown through a variety of numerical examples.

Abstract: The preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) algorithm is one of the most
popular algorithms for solving large-scale linear systems Ax = b, where A is a
symmetric positive definite matrix. Rather than computing residuals directly,
it updates the residual vectors recursively. Current analyses of the conjugate
gradient (CG) algorithm in finite precision typically assume that the norm of
the recursively updated residual goes orders of magnitude below the machine
precision, focusing mainly on bounding the residual gap thereafter. This work
introduces a framework for the PCG algorithm and provides rigorous proofs that
the relative backward and forward errors of the computed results of PCG can
reach the levels O(u) and O(u)\kappa(A)^{1/2}, respectively, after a sufficient
number of iterations without relying on an assumption concerning the norm of
the recursively updated residual, where u represents the unit roundoff and
\kappa(A) is the condition number of A. Our PCG framework further shows that
applying preconditioners in low precision does not compromise the accuracy of
the final results, provided that reasonable conditions are satisfied. Our
theoretical results are illustrated through a set of numerical experiments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的双指数变换方法，用于改进单侧快速递减函数的Sinc逼近精度，实现了几乎指数级收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的变量变换方法虽然改进了Sinc逼近的收敛速度，但仍然是根指数级收敛，改进不够显著。需要一种能显著提高收敛速度的新方法。

Method: 提出新的变量变换t = 2sinh(log(log(1+exp(πsinh x))))，这是一种双指数(DE)变换，用于单侧快速递减函数的Sinc逼近。

Result: 理论分析和数值实验表明，所提出的逼近公式能够实现几乎指数级收敛，显著优于现有的根指数级收敛方法。

Conclusion: 新的双指数变换方法有效提升了Sinc逼近的收敛速度，为单侧快速递减函数的数值逼近提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The Sinc approximation is known to be a highly efficient approximation
formula for rapidly decreasing functions. For unilateral rapidly decreasing
functions, which rapidly decrease as $x\to\infty$ but does not as
$x\to-\infty$, an appropriate variable transformation makes the functions
rapidly decreasing. As such a variable transformation, Stenger proposed $t =
\sinh(\log(\operatorname{arsinh}(\exp x)))$, which enables the Sinc
approximation to achieve root-exponential convergence. Recently, another
variable transformation $t = 2\sinh(\log(\log(1+\exp x)))$ was proposed, which
improved the convergence rate. Furthermore, its computational error bound was
provided. However, the improvement is not significant because the convergence
rate is still root-exponential order. To improve the convergence rate
drastically, this study proposes a new transformation $t =
2\sinh(\log(\log(1+\exp(\pi\sinh x))))$, which is categorized as the
double-exponential (DE) transformation. Furthermore, this study provides its
computational error bound, which shows that the proposed approximation formula
may achieve almost exponential convergence. Numerical experiments that confirm
the theoretical result are also provided.

Conclusion: 成功开发了三种高效稳定的数值方案，EV-MA策略有效解决了强非线性系统中的数值不稳定性问题，为相场晶体模拟提供了可靠的计算工具。

Abstract: This paper develops three linear and energy-stable schemes for a modified
phase field crystal model with a strong nonlinear vacancy potential (VMPFC
model). This sixth-order phase-field model enables realistic crystal growth
simulation. Starting from a Crank-Nicolson scheme based on the stabilized-SAV
(S-SAV) method, we optimize it via the generalized positive auxiliary variable
(GPAV) and modified exponential scalar auxiliary variable (ESAV) methods,
thereby reducing computational complexity or eliminating the requirement for
the nonlinear free energy potential to be bounded from below. The newly
developed Energy-Variation Moving Average (EV-MA) adaptive time-stepping
strategy resolves numerical instabilities and mitigates the high parameter
sensitivity of the conventional adaptive time algorithm during rapid energy
decay in the strongly nonlinear system. Unlike conventional instantaneous
energy-derivative monitors, the EV-MA technique incorporates a moving average
of the energy variation. Additionally, the rate of change between adjacent time
steps is constrained by a maximum change factor. This design effectively
dampens spurious oscillations and enhances the robustness of time step
selection. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to validate the
accuracy and energy stability of the proposed schemes. The EV-MA strategy is
also demonstrated to perform robustly across a wide range of parameters.

Conclusion: 通过傅里叶切片方法实现了线性复杂度的核计算

Abstract: Kernels are key in machine learning for modeling interactions. Unfortunately,
brute-force computation of the related kernel sums scales quadratically with
the number of samples. Recent Fourier-slicing methods lead to an improved
linear complexity, provided that the kernel can be sliced and its Fourier
coefficients are known. To obtain these coefficients, we view the slicing
relation as an inverse problem and present two algorithms for their recovery.
Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the speed and accuracy of our
methods.

strong-stability preserving Runge-Kutta scheme. We also consider a coupling of
the fluid model to relativistic particles. We perform a numerical study of the
scheme which shows convergence and conservation properties of the proposed
methods and apply the new scheme to a plasma wake field simulation.

Conclusion: 数值实验验证了理论结果和方法的有效性，表明所提出的四阶主动通量方法在抛物线问题中具有良好的精度和稳定性。

Abstract: The active flux (AF) method is a compact high-order finite volume method
originally proposed for solving hyperbolic conservation laws, in which cell
averages and point values at cell interfaces are evolved simultaneously. This
paper develops a fourth-order AF method for one- and two-dimensional parabolic
problems, employing the explicit strong-stability-preserving Runge-Kutta
(SSP-RK) method for time integration. The proposed method is built on a
degenerate first-order system with auxiliary variables representing the
derivatives of the primal variable, similar to local discontinuous Galerkin
(LDG) methods, which avoids introducing pseudo-time or performing iterations
within a physical time step in the existing hyperbolic formulations. The
evolution of cell averages follows the standard finite volume method, ensuring
conservation, while the point values of both the primal and auxiliary variables
are updated using fourth-order central finite difference operators. A discrete
Fourier analysis confirms the fourth-order accuracy in 1D. With the third-order
SSP-RK method, the maximum CFL number for stability is $0.27$ in 1D, as
obtained by von Neumann analysis, larger than that of LDG methods. The proposed
method is further applied to the porous medium equation, and
positivity-preserving limitings are incorporated to guarantee the
non-negativity of the numerical solutions. Several numerical experiments
validate the theoretical results and efficacy of the method.

Abstract: Experiments on 2D random water wave propagation in a large wave tank are
analyzed when the effect of dispersion changes. A stereoscopic profilometry
technique is used to measure the water surface displacement resolved in both
time and space over a significant fraction of the wave tank. The wave regimes
are characterized by analyzing the space-time spectral statistical properties
of the wave field. At a given, finite, water depth, the effect of dispersion
can be varied by tuning the peak frequency of the wave generation. In shallow
water conditions, the waves are only weakly dispersive and this enables the
propagation of solitons. {In these conditions random wave forcing produces
soliton gases}. In deep water conditions, the waves are dispersive and for
wideband spectra, one observes the development of weak turbulence. A transition
between these regimes is observed when changing the peak forcing frequency
(dispersion) and the wave amplitude (nonlinearity), with a clear threshold
between states with solitons and soliton-less states. The development of a
soliton gas is associated with a strong change of the wave spectrum as well as
a significant evolution of the distribution of the water elevation. We also
observed a strong effect of the finite size of the tank due to the peculiar
reflection laws of line solitons.

Abstract: This study introduces an innovative ventilation system, which leverages an
origami-inspired structure to improve and regulate natural airflow driven by
the stack effect, with applications in underground mines and buildings. The
proposed system retrofits chimneys and/or exhaust risers with expandable
origami units that dynamically modulate their geometric features (height and
vent area) to control buoyancy-driven ventilation independent of external wind
or solar conditions. The efficacy of the proposed concept is evaluated using a
three-dimensional computational model that focuses on how the geometric design
of the deployable stack and varying atmospheric conditions affect the
volumetric airflow through the stack in both its fully expanded and contracted
states. The results show that the ventilation rate increases by up to 25\% with
each doubling of the height of the origami stack. % These findings highlight
the potential of leveraging origami-inspired structures for adaptable and
controllable energy-efficient ventilation, which is particularly beneficial in
energy-intensive applications and/or remote, off-grid locations.

Abstract: Chirped coherent Rayleigh-Brillouin scattering (CRBS) is a flow diagnostic
technique that offers high signal-to-noise ratios and nanosecond temporal
resolution. To extract information of dilute gas flow, experimental spectra
must be compared with theoretical predictions derived from the Boltzmann
equation. In this work, we develop a MATLAB code that deterministically solves
the Boltzmann equation to compute CRBS spectra, enabling each line shape to be
obtained in about one minute. We find that the CRBS spectrum is highly
sensitive to the intermolecular potential, and that rapid chirping generates
fine ripples around the Rayleigh peak along with spectral asymmetries.

Abstract: Kinetic frictional forces resisting droplet motion often appear to be
separate to surface wettability and adhesive forces. Here we show that such
friction arises from a simple combination of the contact angle hysteresis and
adhesive force. We show theoretically, and confirm using tilt angle experiments
of droplets on liquid-like surfaces, the dependence of the coefficient of
droplet-on-solid kinetic friction on system parameters. We also show that a
molecular kinetic-type model can describe the observed non-linear
velocity-force relationship. Our findings provide a fundamental understanding
of the relationship between droplet-on-solid friction, and wettability and
liquid adhesion.

Abstract: We revisit the classical Womersley solution for pulsatile viscous flow in a
circular tube and reconstruct its full time-domain geometry from first
principles. By combining harmonic decomposition with exact Bessel solutions, we
derive a unified spectral spacetime analytical solution in which the
instantaneous relationship between pressure gradient and velocity can be
visualized as a loop in phase space. The enclosed loop area is shown to equal
the mean hydraulic power per cycle, establishing an exact geometric-energetic
identity that holds for arbitrary Womersley number and harmonic composition. We
further show that higher harmonic content and increasing Womersley number
induce topological transitions in these loops, producing cusps,
self-intersections, and curvature hot spots that correspond to inertial-viscous
phase dispersion. This framework provides a rigorous baseline for interpreting
arterial pressure-flow loops, connecting frequency-domain impedance analysis to
measurable time-domain geometry.

Conclusion: 这种周期性库仑裂变现象具有广泛的应用潜力，从纳米尺度制造到电喷雾电离等领域。

Abstract: Charged water drops are more widespread than commonly acknowledged. For
example, raindrops typically carry charges of order Q ~ 1 pC, while routine
pipetting in the laboratory produces drops with Q ~ 50 pC. Here, we show that
such modest charging can spontaneously generate periodic Coulomb fissions for
evaporating water drops on lubricated surfaces, with more than 60 successive
cycles observed over 30 min. Interestingly, the underlying instability can be
quantitatively predicted by two fissility thresholds: one marking the onset of
drop elongation and another triggering fission. Each fission culminates with a
fine liquid jet that disintegrates into 40-50 microdroplets, expelled within
microseconds. The phenomenon spans an extraordinary range of length scales
(from millimetres to microns) and time scales (hour to microseconds), with
broad potential applications ranging from nanoscale fabrication to electrospray
ionization.

Abstract: The significance of small-scale forcing of particles on the carrier
two-dimensional turbulent flow has been shown [Pandey, Perlekar, and Mitra,
Phys. Rev. E, 100, 013114 (2019)] to influence the spectral scaling properties
of the carrier fluid. We investigate possible consequences of such two-way
coupling in a turbulent suspension of inertial particles in one and two-point
Eulerian and Lagrangian statistics. In particular, we find signatures of a
possibly enhanced intermittency in the vorticity distributions. We characterize
the changes in the (small-scale) geometry of the flow via the Okubo-Weiss
parameter. Finally, we examine the scaling properties of the second-order
(vorticity) structure functions and find a non-trivial form of scale-invariance
at finite mass-loading. This suggests that a dual-scale forcing mechanism on
the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation may be an effective model to mimic
the role of particle feedback in turbulence.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel transport model for soluble surfactants in
two-phase flows. In a two-phase flow, the soluble surfactants can adsorb/desorb
from/into the bulk of any of the phases to the interface and can modify the
interface properties. This results in sharp gradients in the surfactant
concentration on the interface and also between the two phases in the bulk when
there is selective adsorption/desorption, presenting a serious challenge for
the numerical simulations.
  To overcome this challenge, we propose a computational model for the
transport of soluble surfactants that can model the adsorption and desorption
processes accurately. The model is discretized using a central-difference
scheme, which leads to a non-dissipative implementation that is crucial for the
simulation of turbulent flows. The model is used with the ACDI
diffuse-interface method (Jain, 2022), but can also be used with other
algebraic-based interface-capturing methods. Furthermore, the provable
strengths of the proposed model are: (a) the model maintains the positivity
property of the surfactant concentration field, a physical realizability
requirement for the simulation of surfactants, when the proposed criterion is
satisfied, (b) the proposed model maintains discrete confinement of the
interfacial and bulk surfactants and prevents artificial numerical diffusion of
the surfactant between the interface and the bulk and between the two phases in
the bulk.
  Finally, we present numerical simulations using the proposed model for both
one-dimensional and multi-dimensional cases and assess: the accuracy and
robustness of the model, the validity of the positivity property of the scalar
concentration field, and the confinement of the surfactant at the interface. We
also study the effect of surfactants on an oscillating droplet and on a complex
droplet/bubble-laden turbulent flow.

Abstract: A viscous, incompressible, micropolar bio-nanofluid flowing across a
stretching sheet in three dimensions while being driven to convect several slip
boundaries in the presence of a magnetic field was studied. With the assistance
of the relevant transformations, a mathematical model is presented. The finite
difference method numerically solves the converted non-linear ordinary
differential equations. A comprehensive assessment was conducted to examine the
impact of governing parameters on dimensionless velocity, micro-rotation,
temperature, nanoparticle volume fraction, microorganisms, and heat transfer
rate. The findings of this investigation showed a strong correlation when
compared to previous studies, indicating a high level of agreement and
consistency between the results. The study's conclusions indicate that the
velocity profile increases with higher values of {\lambda} and {\delta}, while
it decreases with higher values of A, {\delta}v, and M. The micro-rotation
profile F({\eta}) drops as the spin gradient viscosity parameter rises, but
G({\eta}) increases. The temperature profile decreases with higher Prandtl
numbers but increases with higher thermophoresis parameters. The concentration
profile decreases with higher Schmidt numbers and Brownian motion parameters.
The microorganism profile increases with higher Peclet numbers and
microorganism slip parameters but decreases with higher bio-convection Schmidt
numbers. Lastly, the local Nusselt number grows with increasing values of the
stretching parameter {\lambda}.

Abstract: This research employs a local thermal non-equilibrium (LTNE) model to analyze
the heat transfer phenomenon through a porous fin, considering natural
convection and radiation effects. The infiltration velocity within the porous
medium is evaluated using the Darcy model, and buoyancy effects are accounted
for using the Boussinesq approximation. The Akbari-Ganji method (AGM) is
applied to address the governing energy equations. The accuracy of the proposed
solution is verified by comparing it with numerical results obtained from the
finite difference method (FDM), the finite element method (FEM), and earlier
investigations. The results are presented regarding the total average Nusselt
number and temperature profiles. These results shed light on the influence of
several important parameters, such as the thermal conductivity ratio,
dimensionless thickness, convectional heat transfer, and external and internal
radiation. The analysis reveals that decreasing Rayleigh and Biot numbers
reduces the temperature profiles of the solid phase. Additionally, when the
Rayleigh number is low but the assigned Biot number is high, the temperature
difference between the solid and fluid phases diminishes. Furthermore,
increased thermal conductivity ratio and dimensionless thickness for assigned
Biot and Rayleigh numbers lead to higher solid phase temperatures. The Nusselt
number exhibits a decreasing trend with a decreasing thermal conductivity ratio
but increases with higher Rayleigh and Biot numbers and increased external
radiation.

Motivation: 研究数值模拟中时间步长对NS湍流最终流型和统计特性的影响，揭示数值噪声在湍流模拟中的重要作用，以及NS方程理论假设与数值模拟实践之间的不一致性。

Method: 采用双精度直接数值模拟（DNS）求解二维Rayleigh-Bénard对流的Navier-Stokes方程，使用不同的时间步长进行模拟。

Result: 发现存在两种完全不同的最终流型：涡流和带状流，它们的统计特性完全不同。当时间步长减小到非常小的值时，两种流型频繁交替出现，表明每种湍流流型对应的时间步长分布密集。

Conclusion: 随机数值噪声对NS湍流数值模拟的最终流型和统计特性有巨大影响，这与NS方程忽略小扰动的理论假设存在逻辑矛盾。需要进一步研究NS湍流、其数值模拟和真实湍流之间的本质差异。

Abstract: A two-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection governed by the
Navier-Stokes (NS) equations is solved by traditional direct numerical
simulation (DNS) using double precision and various time-steps. It is found
that there are two kinds of final flow types, one is vortical flow, the other
is zonal flow, and their statistics are completely different. Especially, the
two flow types frequently alternate as the time-step decreases to a very small
value, suggesting that the time-step corresponding to each type of turbulent
flows should be densely distributed. Thus, stochastic numerical noise has huge
influences on final flow type and statistics of numerical simulation of the NS
turbulence (i.e. turbulence governed by NS equations), since time-step has a
close relationship with numerical noise. However, the NS equations as
turbulence model have such an assumption that all small stochastic disturbances
for $t>0$ are negligible. This leads to a logic paradox in theory. Obviously,
more investigations are necessary to reveal the essential differences between
the NS turbulence, its numerical simulation, and real turbulence.

Abstract: We conducted high-resolution large-eddy simulations over a real urban
district in Barcelona to examine the impact of wind direction on near-ground
flow. The computational mesh resolves over 500 million degrees of freedom, with
a spatial resolution on the order of 1 m at pedestrian level. This allows a
detailed analysis of mean velocity and turbulence patterns within the canopy
layer. Although instantaneous flow fields differ significantly between cases,
double-averaged profiles of velocity and turbulence intensity remain remarkably
consistent across all wind directions. The results reveal a shear-driven mixing
layer below the average building height and turbulence maxima near the tallest
buildings, highlighting the influence of urban morphology on the development of
flow and turbulence.

Abstract: Wind farm parameterizations are crucial for quantifying the wind-farm
atmosphere interaction, where wind turbines are typically modeled as elevated
momentum sinks and sources of turbulence kinetic energy (TKE). These quantities
must be properly distributed to the mesoscale grid. Existing parameterizations
use the single-column method. However, this method can easily lead to the
errors of the spatial distribution of the sink and source, thereby impacting
the accuracy of mesoscale flow simulations. To this end, we propose a
multi-column spatial distribution method based on the Gaussian function. This
method distributes the sink and source to multiple vertical grid columns based
on the grid weights, which are analytically determined by integrating the
two-dimensional Gaussian function over the mesoscale grid. We have applied this
method to the classic Fitch model, proposed the improved Fitch-Gaussian model,
and integrated it into the mesoscale Weather Research and Forecasting model.
Using high-fidelity large eddy simulation as a benchmark, we compared the
performance of the proposed method with the single-column method. The results
show that the proposed method captures the spatial distribution of the sink and
source more accurately, with a higher correlation coefficient and lower
normalized root mean square error. Furthermore, the Fitch-Gaussian model better
captures the overall spatial distribution patterns of velocity deficit and
added TKE. Therefore, the proposed method is recommended for future mesoscale
wind farm simulations, especially when the influence of the wind turbine rotor
spans multiple mesoscale grid columns.

Abstract: We present an efficient and realisable active flow control framework with few
non-intrusive sensors. The method builds upon data-driven, reduced-order
predictive models based on Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and efficient
gradient-based Model Predictive Control (MPC). The model uses only
surface-mounted pressure probes to infer the wake state, and is trained
entirely offline on a dataset built with open-loop actuations, thus avoiding
the complexities of online learning. Sparsification of the sensors needed for
control from an initially large set is achieved using SHapley Additive
exPlanations. A parsimonious set of sensors is then deployed in closed-loop
control with MPC. The framework is tested in numerical simulations of a 2D
truck model at Reynolds number 500, with pulsed-jet actuators placed in the
rear of the truck to control the wake. The parsimonious LSTM-MPC achieved a
drag reduction of 12.8%.

Abstract: The performance of convergent divergent nozzles plays a critical role in
aerospace propulsion systems, where efficient expansion of high-temperature,
high-pressure gases directly impacts thrust generation. In this study, we
investigate a series of nozzle geometries using numerical simulations performed
in ANSYS Fluent, with design parameters guided by classical compressible flow
theory, initially developed by Ludwig Prandtl. The governing equations of
conservation of mass, momentum, and energy are solved under steady state
conditions, with emphasis on shock formation, boundary-layer effects, and Mach
number distributions across the nozzle throat and divergent section. Parametric
analyses are conducted to evaluate the influence of nozzle contour, area ratio,
and throat geometry on flow acceleration and thrust coefficient. The results
demonstrate close agreement with theoretical predictions of isentropic
compressible flow while also highlighting deviations due to viscous and
three-dimensional effects. These findings provide design insights for
optimizing nozzle performance in propulsion applications ranging from launch
vehicles to high speed air breathing systems.
