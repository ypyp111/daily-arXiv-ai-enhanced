### [1] [nuCarla: A nuScenes-Style Bird's-Eye View Perception Dataset for CARLA Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13744)
*Zhijie Qiao,Zhong Cao,Henry X. Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: nuCarla是一个在CARLA模拟器中构建的大规模BEV感知数据集，解决了端到端自动驾驶缺乏标准化闭环测试数据集的问题，提供了与nuScenes格式兼容的数据和高性能BEV骨干网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集主要来自真实世界的非交互条件，仅支持开环学习，缺乏标准化、大规模且经过验证的数据集来促进有意义的中间表示学习，导致闭环端到端模型性能落后于简单基于规则的基线。

Method: 在CARLA模拟器中构建nuScenes风格的大规模BEV感知数据集，具有完全兼容nuScenes格式、数据集规模与nuScenes相当但类别分布更均衡、可直接用于闭环仿真部署等特点。

Result: 提供了高性能BEV骨干网络，实现了最先进的检测结果，为闭环端到端开发提供了数据和模型作为开放基准。

Conclusion: nuCarla显著加速了闭环端到端自动驾驶的发展，为可靠和安全感知的研究铺平了道路。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving heavily relies on closed-loop simulation, where perception, planning, and control are jointly trained and evaluated in interactive environments. Yet, most existing datasets are collected from the real world under non-interactive conditions, primarily supporting open-loop learning while offering limited value for closed-loop testing. Due to the lack of standardized, large-scale, and thoroughly verified datasets to facilitate learning of meaningful intermediate representations, such as bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, closed-loop E2E models remain far behind even simple rule-based baselines. To address this challenge, we introduce nuCarla, a large-scale, nuScenes-style BEV perception dataset built within the CARLA simulator. nuCarla features (1) full compatibility with the nuScenes format, enabling seamless transfer of real-world perception models; (2) a dataset scale comparable to nuScenes, but with more balanced class distributions; (3) direct usability for closed-loop simulation deployment; and (4) high-performance BEV backbones that achieve state-of-the-art detection results. By providing both data and models as open benchmarks, nuCarla substantially accelerates closed-loop E2E development, paving the way toward reliable and safety-aware research in autonomous driving.

### [2] [Known Meets Unknown: Mitigating Overconfidence in Open Set Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13775)
*Dongdong Zhao,Ranxin Fang,Changtian Song,Zhihui Liu,Jianwen Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个解决开放集识别中过度自信问题的框架，通过扰动不确定性估计和两阶段未知检测来增强已知与未知类别的区分能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放集识别中，当未知样本与已知类别语义相似时，模型会过度自信地将未知样本误分类为已知类别，这削弱了开放集识别的性能

Method: 框架包含两个组件：基于扰动的不确定性估计模块（通过参数扰动生成多样化预测并量化预测不确定性）和两阶段未知检测模块（利用估计的不确定性改进已知与未知类别的区分）

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验结果表明，所提框架优于现有的开放集识别方法

Conclusion: 该框架通过显式缓解类别间重叠引起的过度自信问题，有效提升了开放集识别性能

Abstract: Open Set Recognition (OSR) requires models not only to accurately classify known classes but also to effectively reject unknown samples. However, when unknown samples are semantically similar to known classes, inter-class overlap in the feature space often causes models to assign unjustifiably high confidence to them, leading to misclassification as known classes -- a phenomenon known as overconfidence. This overconfidence undermines OSR by blurring the decision boundary between known and unknown classes. To address this issue, we propose a framework that explicitly mitigates overconfidence caused by inter-class overlap. The framework consists of two components: a perturbation-based uncertainty estimation module, which applies controllable parameter perturbations to generate diverse predictions and quantify predictive uncertainty, and an unknown detection module with distinct learning-based classifiers, implemented as a two-stage procedure, which leverages the estimated uncertainty to improve discrimination between known and unknown classes, thereby enhancing OSR performance. Experimental results on three public datasets show that the proposed framework achieves superior performance over existing OSR methods.

### [3] [Temporal Object-Aware Vision Transformer for Few-Shot Video Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13784)
*Yogesh Kumar,Anand Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于少样本视频目标检测的新方法，通过对象感知时序建模和选择性特征传播来提升检测精度和时序一致性，在多个数据集上实现了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统目标检测方法需要大量标注数据的问题，以及视频中由于遮挡和外观变化导致的时序一致性挑战，同时避免复杂且计算昂贵的区域提议方法。

Method: 采用对象感知时序建模方法，通过过滤机制选择性传播高置信度的对象特征跨帧，结合少样本训练的检测和分类头，实现高效特征传播而不依赖显式对象管提议。

Result: 在5-shot设置下，AP提升分别为：FSVOD-500 3.7%、FSYTV-40 5.3%、VidOR 4.3%、VidVRD 4.5%。在1-shot、3-shot和10-shot配置下也表现出持续改进。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了少样本视频目标检测中的时序一致性和新对象泛化问题，通过简单高效的特征传播机制实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Few-shot Video Object Detection (FSVOD) addresses the challenge of detecting novel objects in videos with limited labeled examples, overcoming the constraints of traditional detection methods that require extensive training data. This task presents key challenges, including maintaining temporal consistency across frames affected by occlusion and appearance variations, and achieving novel object generalization without relying on complex region proposals, which are often computationally expensive and require task-specific training. Our novel object-aware temporal modeling approach addresses these challenges by incorporating a filtering mechanism that selectively propagates high-confidence object features across frames. This enables efficient feature progression, reduces noise accumulation, and enhances detection accuracy in a few-shot setting. By utilizing few-shot trained detection and classification heads with focused feature propagation, we achieve robust temporal consistency without depending on explicit object tube proposals. Our approach achieves performance gains, with AP improvements of 3.7% (FSVOD-500), 5.3% (FSYTV-40), 4.3% (VidOR), and 4.5 (VidVRD) in the 5-shot setting. Further results demonstrate improvements in 1-shot, 3-shot, and 10-shot configurations. We make the code public at: https://github.com/yogesh-iitj/fs-video-vit

### [4] [FusionFM: All-in-One Multi-Modal Image Fusion with Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13794)
*Huayi Zhu,Xiu Shu,Youqiang Xiong,Qiao Liu,Rui Chen,Di Yuan,Xiaojun Chang,Zhenyu He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于流匹配的图像融合方法，通过直接概率传输从源模态到融合图像分布，提高了采样效率和结构一致性，同时采用伪标签选择和融合精炼模块来提升融合质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态图像融合方法依赖任务特定模型，训练成本高且可扩展性有限；生成方法虽然提供统一建模视角，但采样轨迹复杂导致推理缓慢。

Method: 利用流匹配范式实现从源模态到融合图像的直接概率传输；收集多个SOTA模型的融合结果作为先验，使用任务感知选择函数选择可靠伪标签；引入融合精炼模块系统识别、分解和增强伪标签中的退化组件；集成弹性权重巩固和经验回放机制处理多任务场景。

Result: 在多种融合任务中实现竞争性性能，显著提高采样效率，并保持轻量级模型设计。

Conclusion: 该方法为图像融合提供了一种高效、统一的解决方案，在保持性能的同时显著提升了采样效率和模型轻量化程度。

Abstract: Current multi-modal image fusion methods typically rely on task-specific models, leading to high training costs and limited scalability. While generative methods provide a unified modeling perspective, they often suffer from slow inference due to the complex sampling trajectories from noise to image. To address this, we formulate image fusion as a direct probabilistic transport from source modalities to the fused image distribution, leveraging the flow matching paradigm to improve sampling efficiency and structural consistency. To mitigate the lack of high-quality fused images for supervision, we collect fusion results from multiple state-of-the-art models as priors, and employ a task-aware selection function to select the most reliable pseudo-labels for each task. We further introduce a Fusion Refiner module that employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to systematically identify, decompose, and enhance degraded components in selected pseudo-labels. For multi-task scenarios, we integrate elastic weight consolidation and experience replay mechanisms to preserve cross-task performance and enhance continual learning ability from both parameter stability and memory retention perspectives. Our approach achieves competitive performance across diverse fusion tasks, while significantly improving sampling efficiency and maintaining a lightweight model design. The code will be available at: https://github.com/Ist-Zhy/FusionFM.

### [5] [A Trajectory-free Crash Detection Framework with Generative Approach and Segment Map Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13795)
*Weiying Shen,Hao Yu,Yu Dong,Pan Liu,Yu Han,Xin Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段无轨迹碰撞检测框架，通过扩散模型生成合理的未来路段地图并与监控地图比较来检测碰撞


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决轨迹获取和车辆跟踪的限制，利用记录个体交通动态数据的路段地图直接进行碰撞检测

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段使用Mapfusion扩散模型生成未来路段地图，第二阶段通过比较监控地图与生成地图来检测碰撞

Result: Mapfusion成功生成了基于学习运动模式的真实路段演化地图，在不同采样间隔下保持鲁棒性，在真实世界碰撞实验中准确检测碰撞

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段方法在准确检测碰撞方面有效，为主动安全管理策略提供了新途径

Abstract: Real-time crash detection is essential for developing proactive safety management strategy and enhancing overall traffic efficiency. To address the limitations associated with trajectory acquisition and vehicle tracking, road segment maps recording the individual-level traffic dynamic data were directly served in crash detection. A novel two-stage trajectory-free crash detection framework, was present to generate the rational future road segment map and identify crashes. The first-stage diffusion-based segment map generation model, Mapfusion, conducts a noisy-to-normal process that progressively adds noise to the road segment map until the map is corrupted to pure Gaussian noise. The denoising process is guided by sequential embedding components capturing the temporal dynamics of segment map sequences. Furthermore, the generation model is designed to incorporate background context through ControlNet to enhance generation control. Crash detection is achieved by comparing the monitored segment map with the generations from diffusion model in second stage. Trained on non-crash vehicle motion data, Mapfusion successfully generates realistic road segment evolution maps based on learned motion patterns and remains robust across different sampling intervals. Experiments on real-world crashes indicate the effectiveness of the proposed two-stage method in accurately detecting crashes.

### [6] [Synergizing Multigrid Algorithms with Vision Transformer: A Novel Approach to Enhance the Seismic Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13800)
*Huiwen Wu,Shuo Zhang,Yi Liu,Hongbin Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ADATG方法，一种针对地震数据的自适应双网格基础模型训练策略，通过希尔伯特编码和频谱分解有效处理地震数据中的高低频特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉变换器在处理地震数据时忽略了内在模式，无法高效捕捉高低频地震信息。地震数据具有独特特征，需要专门的处理技术。

Method: 使用频谱分解分离高低频分量，采用分层希尔伯特编码表示数据，并提出自适应训练策略：先关注粗粒度信息，再逐步细化到细粒度特征。

Result: 大量实验证明了该训练方法的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: 研究强调了基于地震图像高低频特征的数据编码和训练策略的重要性，有助于增强视觉地震基础模型的预训练效果。

Abstract: Due to the emergency and homogenization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology development, transformer-based foundation models have revolutionized scientific applications, such as drug discovery, materials research, and astronomy. However, seismic data presents unique characteristics that require specialized processing techniques for pretraining foundation models in seismic contexts with high- and low-frequency features playing crucial roles. Existing vision transformers (ViTs) with sequential tokenization ignore the intrinsic pattern and fail to grasp both the high- and low-frequency seismic information efficiently and effectively. This work introduces a novel adaptive two-grid foundation model training strategy (ADATG) with Hilbert encoding specifically tailored for seismogram data, leveraging the hierarchical structures inherent in seismic data. Specifically, our approach employs spectrum decomposition to separate high- and low-frequency components and utilizes hierarchical Hilbert encoding to represent the data effectively. Moreover, observing the frequency principle observed in ViTs, we propose an adaptive training strategy that initially emphasizes coarse-level information and then progressively refines the model's focus on fine-level features. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our training methods. This research highlights the importance of data encoding and training strategies informed by the distinct characteristics of high- and low-frequency features in seismic images, ultimately contributing to the enhancement of visual seismic foundation models pretraining.

### [7] [Passive Dementia Screening via Facial Temporal Micro-Dynamics Analysis of In-the-Wild Talking-Head Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13802)
*Filippo Cenacchi. Longbing Cao,Mitchell McEwan,Deborah Richards*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种基于面部微动态分析的被动痴呆筛查方法，通过分析眨眼动态、嘴部运动、注视变化和头部微调等面部运动特征，无需语言或文本即可进行早期神经认知变化检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有痴呆筛查方法主要依赖语音或脚本化访谈，限制了在临床环境外的应用，且预测结果与语言和转录紧密耦合。本研究旨在开发一种无需语言、可在自然环境中大规模应用的被动筛查方法。

Method: 通过稳定面部信号，将面部微运动转换为可解释的时间序列，平滑处理后提取紧凑的片段级统计特征。分析运动在不同通道的分布而非幅度，使每个通道的影响透明化。

Result: 在YT DemTalk数据集上，注视不稳定性和嘴部/下颌动态被识别为最具信息量的线索，轻量级分类器取得了AUROC 0.953、平均精度0.961、F1分数0.851和准确率0.857的优异表现。

Conclusion: 面部时间微动态分析能够有效进行语言无关的痴呆筛查，该方法具有可扩展性，可跨设备、主题和文化应用，为大规模被动筛查提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We target passive dementia screening from short camera-facing talking head video, developing a facial temporal micro dynamics analysis for language free detection of early neuro cognitive change. This enables unscripted, in the wild video analysis at scale to capture natural facial behaviors, transferrable across devices, topics, and cultures without active intervention by clinicians or researchers during recording. Most existing resources prioritize speech or scripted interviews, limiting use outside clinics and coupling predictions to language and transcription. In contrast, we identify and analyze whether temporal facial kinematics, including blink dynamics, small mouth jaw motions, gaze variability, and subtle head adjustments, are sufficient for dementia screening without speech or text. By stabilizing facial signals, we convert these micro movements into interpretable facial microdynamic time series, smooth them, and summarize short windows into compact clip level statistics for screening. Each window is encoded by its activity mix (the relative share of motion across streams), thus the predictor analyzes the distribution of motion across streams rather than its magnitude, making per channel effects transparent. We also introduce YT DemTalk, a new dataset curated from publicly available, in the wild camera facing videos. It contains 300 clips (150 with self reported dementia, 150 controls) to test our model and offer a first benchmarking of the corpus. On YT DemTalk, ablations identify gaze lability and mouth/jaw dynamics as the most informative cues, and light weighted shallow classifiers could attain a dementia prediction performance of (AUROC) 0.953, 0.961 Average Precision (AP), 0.851 F1-score, and 0.857 accuracy.

### [8] [Can World Simulators Reason? Gen-ViRe: A Generative Visual Reasoning Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13853)
*Xinxin Liu,Zhaopan Xu,Kai Wang,Yong Jae Lee,Yuzhang Shang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gen-ViRe是一个新的视觉推理基准测试框架，将链式帧推理分解为6个认知维度和24个子任务，用于定量评估视频生成模型作为推理器的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频生成基准主要关注保真度或对齐度，无法评估链式帧推理能力，这阻碍了对模型核心认知能力的系统理解和改进指导。

Method: 基于认知科学和实际AI应用，将链式帧推理分解为6个认知维度，通过多源数据策划、最小提示协议和混合VLM辅助评估来量化评估。

Result: 对最先进系统的实验揭示了视觉质量与推理深度之间的显著差异，建立了基准和诊断工具。

Conclusion: Gen-ViRe为推进真正的世界模拟器提供了首个定量评估框架，揭示了当前模型在推理能力方面的局限性。

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables sophisticated symbolic reasoning in LLMs, it remains confined to discrete text and cannot simulate the continuous, physics-governed dynamics of the real world. Recent video generation models have emerged as potential world simulators through Chain-of-Frames (CoF) reasoning -- materializing thought as frame-by-frame visual sequences, with each frame representing a physically-grounded reasoning step. Despite compelling demonstrations, a challenge persists: existing benchmarks, focusing on fidelity or alignment, do not assess CoF reasoning and thus cannot measure core cognitive abilities in multi-step planning, algorithmic logic, or abstract pattern extrapolation. This evaluation void prevents systematic understanding of model capabilities and principled guidance for improvement. We introduce Gen-ViRe (Generative Visual Reasoning Benchmark), a framework grounded in cognitive science and real-world AI applications, which decomposes CoF reasoning into six cognitive dimensions -- from perceptual logic to abstract planning -- and 24 subtasks. Through multi-source data curation, minimal prompting protocols, and hybrid VLM-assisted evaluation with detailed criteria, Gen-ViRe delivers the first quantitative assessment of video models as reasoners. Our experiments on SOTA systems reveal substantial discrepancies between impressive visual quality and actual reasoning depth, establishing baselines and diagnostic tools to advance genuine world simulators.

### [9] [RSPose: Ranking Based Losses for Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13857)
*Muhammed Can Keles,Bedrettin Cetinkaya,Sinan Kalkan,Emre Akbas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出基于排序的损失函数来解决基于热图的人体姿态估计中的三个主要问题：MSE损失无法有效提升关节定位精度、热图的空间和类别不平衡、以及评估指标与损失函数之间的不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统热图方法中的三个核心问题：(1) MSE损失对所有像素偏差同等惩罚，无法专注于精确定位关节峰值；(2) 热图存在空间和类别不平衡；(3) 评估指标(mAP)与损失函数之间的不一致性。

Method: 提出基于排序的损失函数，通过理论分析和实证研究证明其优于常用的热图损失(MSE、KL散度)。该方法提高了置信度分数与定位质量之间的相关性，从而在NMS过程中实现更准确的实例选择和更好的mAP性能。

Result: 在COCO-val数据集上，RSPose(ViTPose-H)达到79.9 mAP，超越了之前的最先进方法。同时将SimCC Resnet-50在COCO-val上的性能提升了1.5 AP，达到73.6 AP。在COCO、CrowdPose和MPII三个数据集上均表现出有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的基于排序的损失函数首次实现了与评估指标(mAP)对齐的人体姿态估计损失函数设计，显著提升了模型性能，特别是在一维和二维热图模式下都表现出优越性。

Abstract: While heatmap-based human pose estimation methods have shown strong performance, they suffer from three main problems: (P1) "Commonly used Mean Squared Error (MSE)" Loss may not always improve joint localization because it penalizes all pixel deviations equally, without focusing explicitly on sharpening and correctly localizing the peak corresponding to the joint; (P2) heatmaps are spatially and class-wise imbalanced; and, (P3) there is a discrepancy between the evaluation metric (i.e., mAP) and the loss functions.
  We propose ranking-based losses to address these issues.
  Both theoretically and empirically, we show that our proposed losses are superior to commonly used heatmap losses (MSE, KL-Divergence). Our losses considerably increase the correlation between confidence scores and localization qualities, which is desirable because higher correlation leads to more accurate instance selection during Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and better Average Precision (mAP) performance. We refer to the models trained with our losses as RSPose.
  We show the effectiveness of RSPose across two different modes: one-dimensional and two-dimensional heatmaps, on three different datasets (COCO, CrowdPose, MPII).
  To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose losses that align with the evaluation metric (mAP) for human pose estimation.
  RSPose outperforms the previous state of the art on the COCO-val set and achieves an mAP score of 79.9 with ViTPose-H, a vision transformer model for human pose estimation.
  We also improve SimCC Resnet-50, a coordinate classification-based pose estimation method, by 1.5 AP on the COCO-val set, achieving 73.6 AP.

### [10] [Segmenting Collision Sound Sources in Egocentric Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13863)
*Kranti Kumar Parida,Omar Emara,Hazel Doughty,Dima Damen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CS3任务：基于碰撞声音分割视觉中产生声音的物体，使用弱监督方法和基础模型，在EPIC-CS3和Ego4D-CS3基准上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类多感官感知能力启发，希望从碰撞声音识别产生声音的物体，特别针对第一人称视角视频中视觉场景复杂、物体小、交互短暂的特点。

Method: 提出弱监督的音频条件分割方法，利用CLIP和SAM2基础模型，并结合第一人称视角线索（如手中物体）来识别可能的碰撞声源物体。

Result: 在两个新基准EPIC-CS3和Ego4D-CS3上，方法比竞争基线在mIoU指标上分别提升3倍和4.7倍。

Conclusion: 提出的CS3任务和方法能够有效从碰撞声音分割视觉中的声源物体，在第一人称视角视频中表现优异。

Abstract: Humans excel at multisensory perception and can often recognise object properties from the sound of their interactions. Inspired by this, we propose the novel task of Collision Sound Source Segmentation (CS3), where we aim to segment the objects responsible for a collision sound in visual input (i.e. video frames from the collision clip), conditioned on the audio. This task presents unique challenges. Unlike isolated sound events, a collision sound arises from interactions between two objects, and the acoustic signature of the collision depends on both. We focus on egocentric video, where sounds are often clear, but the visual scene is cluttered, objects are small, and interactions are brief.
  To address these challenges, we propose a weakly-supervised method for audio-conditioned segmentation, utilising foundation models (CLIP and SAM2). We also incorporate egocentric cues, i.e. objects in hands, to find acting objects that can potentially be collision sound sources. Our approach outperforms competitive baselines by $3\times$ and $4.7\times$ in mIoU on two benchmarks we introduce for the CS3 task: EPIC-CS3 and Ego4D-CS3.

### [11] [GRLoc: Geometric Representation Regression for Visual Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13864)
*Changyang Li,Xuejian Ma,Lixiang Liu,Zhan Li,Qingan Yan,Yi Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种几何基础的位置回归方法GRR，通过预测解耦的几何表示（射线方向和点图）来估计相机姿态，而不是直接回归6-DoF姿态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统绝对姿态回归方法容易记忆训练视图而非理解3D场景几何，需要更几何基础的方法来提高泛化能力。

Method: 将姿态回归重新定义为逆渲染过程，预测世界坐标系中的解耦几何表示：射线方向估计旋转，点图估计平移，最后通过可微分求解器恢复6-DoF姿态。

Result: 在7-Scenes和Cambridge Landmarks数据集上达到最先进性能，验证了逆渲染建模对姿态估计泛化性的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过解耦旋转和平移预测并引入几何先验，GRR为通用绝对姿态估计提供了更鲁棒的路径。

Abstract: Absolute Pose Regression (APR) has emerged as a compelling paradigm for visual localization. However, APR models typically operate as black boxes, directly regressing a 6-DoF pose from a query image, which can lead to memorizing training views rather than understanding 3D scene geometry. In this work, we propose a geometrically-grounded alternative. Inspired by novel view synthesis, which renders images from intermediate geometric representations, we reformulate APR as its inverse that regresses the underlying 3D representations directly from the image, and we name this paradigm Geometric Representation Regression (GRR). Our model explicitly predicts two disentangled geometric representations in the world coordinate system: (1) a ray bundle's directions to estimate camera rotation, and (2) a corresponding pointmap to estimate camera translation. The final 6-DoF camera pose is then recovered from these geometric components using a differentiable deterministic solver. This disentangled approach, which separates the learned visual-to-geometry mapping from the final pose calculation, introduces a strong geometric prior into the network. We find that the explicit decoupling of rotation and translation predictions measurably boosts performance. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on 7-Scenes and Cambridge Landmarks datasets, validating that modeling the inverse rendering process is a more robust path toward generalizable absolute pose estimation.

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于膀胱癌复发预测的多序列MRI数据集和H-CNN-ViT模型，该模型通过分层门控注意力机制融合全局和局部特征，在自建数据集上达到78.6%的AUC，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 膀胱癌复发率高（达78%），需要准确的术后监测。多序列MRI是常用检测方法，但术后组织变化使判读困难，且缺乏专门用于复发评估的多序列MRI数据集。

Method: 提出H-CNN-ViT模型，采用分层门控注意力多分支架构，根据上下文需求选择性加权全局（ViT）和局部（CNN）路径特征，实现平衡的目标特征融合。多分支独立处理每个模态，确保最优捕获和整合每个成像通道的独特特性。

Result: 在自建数据集上评估，H-CNN-ViT达到78.6%的AUC，超越了现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: 该研究为膀胱癌复发预测提供了专门的多序列MRI数据集基准，并提出了有效的H-CNN-ViT模型，在复发检测方面表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Bladder cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide, with a recurrence rate of up to 78%, necessitating accurate post-operative monitoring for effective patient management. Multi-sequence contrast-enhanced MRI is commonly used for recurrence detection; however, interpreting these scans remains challenging, even for experienced radiologists, due to post-surgical alterations such as scarring, swelling, and tissue remodeling. AI-assisted diagnostic tools have shown promise in improving bladder cancer recurrence prediction, yet progress in this field is hindered by the lack of dedicated multi-sequence MRI datasets for recurrence assessment study. In this work, we first introduce a curated multi-sequence, multi-modal MRI dataset specifically designed for bladder cancer recurrence prediction, establishing a valuable benchmark for future research. We then propose H-CNN-ViT, a new Hierarchical Gated Attention Multi-Branch model that enables selective weighting of features from the global (ViT) and local (CNN) paths based on contextual demands, achieving a balanced and targeted feature fusion. Our multi-branch architecture processes each modality independently, ensuring that the unique properties of each imaging channel are optimally captured and integrated. Evaluated on our dataset, H-CNN-ViT achieves an AUC of 78.6%, surpassing state-of-the-art models. Our model is publicly available at https://github.com/XLIAaron/H-CNN-ViT}.

*Xiaoyang Wei,Camille Kurtz,Florence Cloppet*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QwenCLIP是一个视觉语言框架，通过用基于大语言模型的嵌入模块替换CLIP的文本编码器，并引入可学习提示来增强跨模态对齐，从而解决CLIP在长文本医学报告处理上的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP的文本编码器仅支持77个token，无法有效处理信息丰富的长文本放射学报告。现有的领域特定编码器如PubMedBERT或ClinicalBERT虽然缓解了这一问题，但仍受限于512个token的输入长度和相对较浅的语义理解。

Method: 提出QwenCLIP框架，用基于大语言模型的嵌入模块（如Qwen3-Embedding）替换CLIP的文本编码器，并引入可学习提示来增强跨模态对齐，利用LLM的扩展上下文窗口和更丰富的表示能力。

Result: QwenCLIP能够从长格式临床文本中捕获全面的医学语义，显著改善了医学图像-文本对齐和在放射学基准测试中的下游性能。

Conclusion: 通过利用大语言模型的扩展上下文窗口和丰富表示能力，QwenCLIP有效解决了长文本医学报告的处理问题，提升了医学视觉语言任务的性能。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has demonstrated strong generalization for vision-language tasks in computer vision and medical domains, yet its text encoder accepts only up to 77 tokens, which limits its ability to represent long and information-rich radiology reports. Recent adaptations using domain-specific encoders, such as PubMedBERT or ClinicalBERT, mitigate this issue by leveraging medical corpora, but remain constrained by their limited input length (typically 512 tokens) and relatively shallow semantic understanding. To address these limitations, we propose QwenCLIP, a vision-language framework that replaces CLIP's text encoder with a large language model (LLM)-based embedding module (e.g., Qwen3-Embedding) and introduces learnable prompts to enhance cross-modal alignment. By leveraging the extended context window and richer representations of LLMs, QwenCLIP captures comprehensive medical semantics from long-form clinical text, substantially improving medical image-text alignment and downstream performance on radiology benchmarks. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Wxy-24/QwenCLIP.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new enhanced model architecture to perform classification of lumbar spine degeneration with DICOM images while using a hybrid approach, integrating EfficientNet and VGG19 together with custom-designed components. The proposed model is differentiated from traditional transfer learning methods as it incorporates a Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer along with a Sparsity-Induced Feature Reduction Layer that forms a multi-tiered framework, further improving feature selection and representation. The Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer makes smart variations of feature weights, with more detailed anatomical features, which are mostly left out in a transfer learning setup. In addition, the Sparsity-Induced Layer removes redundancy for learned features, producing lean yet robust representations for pathology in the lumbar spine. This architecture is novel as it overcomes the constraints in the traditional transfer learning approach, especially in the high-dimensional context of medical images, and achieves a significant performance boost, reaching a precision of 0.9, recall of 0.861, F1 score of 0.88, loss of 0.18, and an accuracy of 88.1%, compared to the baseline model, EfficientNet. This work will present the architectures, preprocessing pipeline, and experimental results. The results contribute to the development of automated diagnostic tools for medical images.

Abstract: Recent advancements in autonomous driving (AD) have explored the use of vision-language models (VLMs) within visual question answering (VQA) frameworks for direct driving decision-making. However, these approaches often depend on handcrafted prompts and suffer from inconsistent performance, limiting their robustness and generalization in real-world scenarios. In this work, we evaluate state-of-the-art open-source VLMs on high-level decision-making tasks using ego-view visual inputs and identify critical limitations in their ability to deliver reliable, context-aware decisions. Motivated by these observations, we propose a new approach that shifts the role of VLMs from direct decision generators to semantic enhancers. Specifically, we leverage their strong general scene understanding to enrich existing vision-based benchmarks with structured, linguistically rich scene descriptions. Building on this enriched representation, we introduce a multi-modal interactive architecture that fuses visual and linguistic features for more accurate decision-making and interpretable textual explanations. Furthermore, we design a post-hoc refinement module that utilizes VLMs to enhance prediction reliability. Extensive experiments on two autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering a promising direction for integrating VLMs into reliable and interpretable AD systems.

Abstract: The population loss of trained deep neural networks often exhibits power law scaling with the size of the training dataset, guiding significant performance advancements in deep learning applications. In this study, we focus on the scaling relationship with data size in the context of medical anatomical segmentation, a domain that remains underexplored. We analyze scaling laws for anatomical segmentation across 15 semantic tasks and 4 imaging modalities, demonstrating that larger datasets significantly improve segmentation performance, following similar scaling trends. Motivated by the topological isomorphism in images sharing anatomical structures, we evaluate the impact of deformation-guided augmentation strategies on data scaling laws, specifically random elastic deformation and registration-guided deformation. We also propose a novel, scalable image augmentation approach that generates diffeomorphic mappings from geodesic subspace based on image registration to introduce realistic deformation. Our experimental results demonstrate that both registered and generated deformation-based augmentation considerably enhance data utilization efficiency. The proposed generated deformation method notably achieves superior performance and accelerated convergence, surpassing standard power law scaling trends without requiring additional data. Overall, this work provides insights into the understanding of segmentation scalability and topological variation impact in medical imaging, thereby leading to more efficient model development with reduced annotation and computational costs.

TL;DR: Uni-Hema是一个多任务、统一模型，用于数字血液病理学，整合了检测、分类、分割、形态预测和跨多种疾病的推理功能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法无法在数字血液病理学的复杂性中提供统一的多任务、多模态推理，包括恶性疾病（如白血病）、感染性疾病（如疟疾）和非恶性红细胞疾病（如镰状细胞病）。

Method: 基于Hema-Former多模态模块，在视觉和文本表示之间建立层次级桥梁，支持不同粒度的多种任务（检测、分类、分割、形态学、掩码语言建模和视觉问答）。利用46个公开数据集，包含超过70万张图像和2.1万个问答对。

Conclusion: 该框架为多任务和多模态数字血液病理学设立了新标准。

Abstract: Digital hematopathology requires cell-level analysis across diverse disease categories, including malignant disorders (e.g., leukemia), infectious conditions (e.g., malaria), and non-malignant red blood cell disorders (e.g., sickle cell disease). Whether single-task, vision-language, WSI-optimized, or single-cell hematology models, these approaches share a key limitation, they cannot provide unified, multi-task, multi-modal reasoning across the complexities of digital hematopathology. To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-Hema, a multi-task, unified model for digital hematopathology integrating detection, classification, segmentation, morphology prediction, and reasoning across multiple diseases. Uni-Hema leverages 46 publicly available datasets, encompassing over 700K images and 21K question-answer pairs, and is built upon Hema-Former, a multimodal module that bridges visual and textual representations at the hierarchy level for the different tasks (detection, classification, segmentation, morphology, mask language modeling and visual question answer) at different granularity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni-Hema achieves comparable or superior performance to train on a single-task and single dataset models, across diverse hematological tasks, while providing interpretable, morphologically relevant insights at the single-cell level. Our framework establishes a new standard for multi-task and multi-modal digital hematopathology. The code will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了短暂冲沟检测中标注数据稀缺的问题，为土壤侵蚀监测提供了可行的弱监督解决方案。

Abstract: Among soil erosion problems, Ephemeral Gullies are one of the most concerning phenomena occurring in agricultural fields. Their short temporal cycles increase the difficulty in automatically detecting them using classical computer vision approaches and remote sensing. Also, due to scarcity of and the difficulty in producing accurate labeled data, automatic detection of ephemeral gullies using Machine Learning is limited to zero-shot approaches which are hard to implement. To overcome these challenges, we present the first weakly supervised pipeline for detection of ephemeral gullies. Our method relies on remote sensing and uses Vision Language Models (VLMs) to drastically reduce the labor-intensive task of manual labeling. In order to achieve that, the method exploits: 1) the knowledge embedded in the VLM's pretraining; 2) a teacher-student model where the teacher learns from noisy labels coming from the VLMs, and the student learns by weak supervision using teacher-generate labels and a noise-aware loss function. We also make available the first-of-its-kind dataset for semi-supervised detection of ephemeral gully from remote-sensed images. The dataset consists of a number of locations labeled by a group of soil and plant scientists, as well as a large number of unlabeled locations. The dataset represent more than 18,000 high-resolution remote-sensing images obtained over the course of 13 years. Our experimental results demonstrate the validity of our approach by showing superior performances compared to VLMs and the label model itself when using weak supervision to train an student model. The code and dataset for this work are made publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出使用压缩视频流中的运动向量来评估生成视频的时间真实性，通过统计差异量化运动质量，并展示了运动向量在改进分类模型性能方面的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成视频模型在时间真实性方面存在弱点，大多数评估指标主要关注空间外观而对运动敏感度有限。

Method: 使用H.264和HEVC等标准从压缩视频流中提取运动向量，通过Kullback-Leibler、Jensen-Shannon和Wasserstein散度计算真实视频与生成视频运动向量统计之间的差异。

Result: 实验显示不同生成模型存在系统性运动差异：Pika和SVD在熵基散度上最接近真实视频，VC2和Text2Video-Zero在MV-sum统计上表现最佳，CogVideo在所有指标上偏差最大。融合运动向量可显著提升分类模型性能。

Conclusion: 压缩域运动向量为诊断生成视频运动缺陷和增强判别模型的时间推理提供了有效的时序信号。

Abstract: Temporal realism remains a central weakness of current generative video models, as most evaluation metrics prioritize spatial appearance and offer limited sensitivity to motion. We introduce a scalable, model-agnostic framework that assesses temporal behavior using motion vectors (MVs) extracted directly from compressed video streams. Codec-generated MVs from standards such as H.264 and HEVC provide lightweight, resolution-consistent descriptors of motion dynamics. We quantify realism by computing Kullback-Leibler, Jensen-Shannon, and Wasserstein divergences between MV statistics of real and generated videos. Experiments on the GenVidBench dataset containing videos from eight state-of-the-art generators reveal systematic discrepancies from real motion: entropy-based divergences rank Pika and SVD as closest to real videos, MV-sum statistics favor VC2 and Text2Video-Zero, and CogVideo shows the largest deviations across both measures. Visualizations of MV fields and class-conditional motion heatmaps further reveal center bias, sparse and piecewise constant flows, and grid-like artifacts that frame-level metrics do not capture. Beyond evaluation, we investigate MV-RGB fusion through channel concatenation, cross-attention, joint embedding, and a motion-aware fusion module. Incorporating MVs improves downstream classification across ResNet, I3D, and TSN backbones, with ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 reaching up to 97.4% accuracy and I3D achieving 99.0% accuracy on real-versus-generated discrimination. These findings demonstrate that compressed-domain MVs provide an effective temporal signal for diagnosing motion defects in generative videos and for strengthening temporal reasoning in discriminative models.

Motivation: 现有MCVT研究过分强调准确性而忽视实时性能和可扩展性，这在城市级应用中随着摄像头数量增长变得尤为关键。

Method: 采用边缘-中心架构：边缘设备处理RTSP视频流，执行目标检测、跟踪、地理映射和特征提取，只传输轻量元数据；中央工作站基于自监督相机链接模型计算跨摄像头关联。

Result: 在RoundaboutHD数据集上，SAE-MCVT能在2K 15FPS视频流上保持实时操作，IDF1分数达到61.2。

Conclusion: 这是首个适合城市级部署的可扩展实时MCVT框架，解决了现有方法在实时性和可扩展性方面的不足。

Abstract: In modern Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), cameras are a key component due to their ability to provide valuable information for multiple stakeholders. A central task is Multi-Camera Vehicle Tracking (MCVT), which generates vehicle trajectories and enables applications such as anomaly detection, traffic density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, most existing studies on MCVT emphasize accuracy while overlooking real-time performance and scalability. These two aspects are essential for real-world deployment and become increasingly challenging in city-scale applications as the number of cameras grows. To address this issue, we propose SAE-MCVT, the first scalable real-time MCVT framework. The system includes several edge devices that interact with one central workstation separately. On the edge side, live RTSP video streams are serialized and processed through modules including object detection, object tracking, geo-mapping, and feature extraction. Only lightweight metadata -- vehicle locations and deep appearance features -- are transmitted to the central workstation. On the central side, cross-camera association is calculated under the constraint of spatial-temporal relations between adjacent cameras, which are learned through a self-supervised camera link model. Experiments on the RoundaboutHD dataset show that SAE-MCVT maintains real-time operation on 2K 15 FPS video streams and achieves an IDF1 score of 61.2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scalable real-time MCVT framework suitable for city-scale deployment.

Abstract: Following road safety norms is non-negotiable not only for humans but also for the AI systems that govern autonomous vehicles. In this work, we evaluate how well multi-modal large language models (LLMs) understand road safety concepts, specifically through schematic and illustrative representations. We curate a pilot dataset of images depicting traffic signs and road-safety norms sourced from school text books and use it to evaluate models capabilities in a zero-shot setting. Our preliminary results show that these models struggle with safety reasoning and reveal gaps between human learning and model interpretation. We further provide an analysis of these performance gaps for future research.

Method: 提出CuRPO训练策略，利用CoT长度和广义交并比奖励作为复杂度指标，从简单到困难逐步结构化训练数据。

Conclusion: CuRPO方法有效解决了CoT推理在视觉定位中的性能退化问题，展现出卓越的效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has recently shown significant promise across various NLP and computer vision tasks by explicitly generating intermediate reasoning steps. However, we find that reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuned CoT reasoning can paradoxically degrade performance in Visual Grounding tasks, particularly as CoT outputs become lengthy or complex. Additionally, our analysis reveals that increased dataset size does not always enhance performance due to varying data complexities. Motivated by these findings, we propose Curriculum-based Relative Policy Optimization (CuRPO), a novel training strategy that leverages CoT length and generalized Intersection over Union (gIoU) rewards as complexity indicators to progressively structure training data from simpler to more challenging examples. Extensive experiments on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and LISA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. CuRPO consistently outperforms existing methods, including Visual-RFT, with notable improvements of up to +12.52 mAP on RefCOCO. Moreover, CuRPO exhibits exceptional efficiency and robustness, delivering strong localization performance even in few-shot learning scenarios, particularly benefiting tasks characterized by ambiguous and intricate textual descriptions.The code is released on https://github.com/qyoung-yan/CuRPO.

Conclusion: 这种方法为数据高效和领域无关的预训练策略提供了有前景的新路径

Abstract: Transformers show remarkable versatility across domains, suggesting the existence of inductive biases beneficial across modalities. In this work, we explore a new way to instil such generic biases in vision transformers (ViTs) by pretraining on procedurally-generated data devoid of visual or semantic content. We generate this data with simple algorithms such as formal grammars, so the results bear no relationship to either natural or synthetic images. We use this procedurally-generated data to pretrain ViTs in a warm-up phase that bypasses their visual patch embedding mechanisms, thus encouraging the models to internalise abstract computational priors. When followed by standard image-based training, this warm-up significantly improves data efficiency, convergence speed, and downstream performance. On ImageNet-1k for example, allocating just 1% of the training budget to procedural data improves final accuracy by over 1.7%. In terms of its effect on performance, 1% procedurally generated data is thus equivalent to 28% of the ImageNet-1k data. These findings suggest a promising path toward new data-efficient and domain-agnostic pretraining strategies.

Abstract: We investigate image segmentation of cells under the lens of scalar fields. Our goal is to learn a continuous scalar field on image domains such that its segmentation produces robust instances for cells present in images. This field is a function parameterized by the trained network, and its segmentation is realized by the watershed method. The fields we experiment with are solutions to the Poisson partial differential equation and a diffusion mimicking the steady-state solution of the heat equation. These solutions are obtained by minimizing just the field residuals, no regularization is needed, providing a robust regression capable of diminishing the adverse impacts of outliers in the training data and allowing for sharp cell boundaries. A single tensor is all that is needed to train a \unet\ thus simplifying implementation, lowering training and inference times, hence reducing energy consumption, and requiring a small memory footprint, all attractive features in edge computing. We present competitive results on public datasets from the literature and show that our novel, simple yet geometrically insightful approach can achieve excellent cell segmentation results.

Conclusion: 通过抽象出指示人类技能的共享行为，所提出的视频表示方法比现有技术具有更好的泛化能力，丰富了当前的多模态大语言模型。

Abstract: Skill assessment from video entails rating the quality of a person's physical performance and explaining what could be done better. Today's models specialize for an individual sport, and suffer from the high cost and scarcity of expert-level supervision across the long tail of sports. Towards closing that gap, we explore transferable video representations for skill assessment. Our CrossTrainer approach discovers skill-attributes, such as balance, control, and hand positioning -- whose meaning transcends the boundaries of any given sport, then trains a multimodal language model to generate actionable feedback for a novel video, e.g., "lift hands more to generate more power" as well as its proficiency level, e.g., early expert. We validate the new model on multiple datasets for both cross-sport (transfer) and intra-sport (in-domain) settings, where it achieves gains up to 60% relative to the state of the art. By abstracting out the shared behaviors indicative of human skill, the proposed video representation generalizes substantially better than an array of existing techniques, enriching today's multimodal large language models.

This technique enhances anatomical detail and soft tissue differentiation, which is vital for early diagnosis and clinical decision-making. However, inherent contrasts disparities between modalities pose fundamental challenges in effectively utilizing reference image textures to guide target image reconstruction, often resulting in suboptimal feature integration. To address this issue, we propose a dual-prompt expert network based on a convolutional dictionary feature decoupling (CD-DPE) strategy for multi-contrast MRI super-resolution. Specifically, we introduce an iterative convolutional dictionary feature decoupling module (CD-FDM) to separate features into cross-contrast and intra-contrast components, thereby reducing redundancy and interference. To fully integrate these features, a novel dual-prompt feature fusion expert module (DP-FFEM) is proposed. This module uses a frequency prompt to guide the selection of relevant reference features for incorporation into the target image, while an adaptive routing prompt determines the optimal method for fusing reference and target features to enhance reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on public multi-contrast MRI datasets demonstrate that CD-DPE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing fine details. Additionally, experiments on unseen datasets demonstrated that CD-DPE exhibits strong generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: RISE是首个用于单静态雷达室内场景理解的基准和系统，通过利用多径反射的几何线索，实现了布局重建和物体检测，在保护隐私的同时提高了室内场景理解的准确性。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决室内场景理解中光学传感器存在的遮挡问题和隐私风险，同时克服毫米波雷达空间分辨率低的限制，实现鲁棒且保护隐私的室内场景理解。

Method: 提出双角度多径增强方法，显式建模到达角和离开角来恢复二次反射；采用仿真到现实的层次扩散框架，将碎片化的雷达响应转换为完整的布局重建和物体检测。

Result: 在布局重建方面，将Chamfer距离降低了60%（降至16厘米）；实现了首个基于毫米波的物体检测，达到58%的IoU；建立了包含100个真实室内轨迹的5万帧大规模数据集。

Conclusion: RISE为使用单个静态雷达实现几何感知和隐私保护的室内场景理解奠定了新的基础，证明了多径反射在室内场景理解中的价值。

Abstract: Robust and privacy-preserving indoor scene understanding remains a fundamental open problem. While optical sensors such as RGB and LiDAR offer high spatial fidelity, they suffer from severe occlusions and introduce privacy risks in indoor environments. In contrast, millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar preserves privacy and penetrates obstacles, but its inherently low spatial resolution makes reliable geometric reasoning difficult.
  We introduce RISE, the first benchmark and system for single-static-radar indoor scene understanding, jointly targeting layout reconstruction and object detection. RISE is built upon the key insight that multipath reflections, traditionally treated as noise, encode rich geometric cues. To exploit this, we propose a Bi-Angular Multipath Enhancement that explicitly models Angle-of-Arrival and Angle-of-Departure to recover secondary (ghost) reflections and reveal invisible structures. On top of these enhanced observations, a simulation-to-reality Hierarchical Diffusion framework transforms fragmented radar responses into complete layout reconstruction and object detection.
  Our benchmark contains 50,000 frames collected across 100 real indoor trajectories, forming the first large-scale dataset dedicated to radar-based indoor scene understanding. Extensive experiments show that RISE reduces the Chamfer Distance by 60% (down to 16 cm) compared to the state of the art in layout reconstruction, and delivers the first mmWave-based object detection, achieving 58% IoU. These results establish RISE as a new foundation for geometry-aware and privacy-preserving indoor scene understanding using a single static radar.

TL;DR: 开发了一个2.5D上下文感知模型，用于自动识别MRI图像的解剖平面方向（轴向、冠状、矢状），准确率达99.49%，比2D模型减少60%错误。该模型在脑肿瘤检测任务中通过元数据增强将准确率从97.0%提升至98.0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能轻松识别MRI图像的解剖平面方向，但自动化系统难以完成此任务。缺失平面方向元数据会复杂化分析、增加数据集合并时的域偏移，并降低诊断分类器的准确性。

Result: 2.5D模型达到99.49%的平面识别准确率，比2D参考模型的98.74%提升显著，错误减少60%。在脑肿瘤检测任务中，元数据增强将准确率从97.0%提升至98.0%，误诊减少33.3%。

Conclusion: 2.5D上下文对于MRI平面方向识别至关重要，生成的元数据能显著提升下游诊断任务的性能。模型已集成到开源交互式网络应用中。

Abstract: Humans can easily identify anatomical planes (axial, coronal, and sagittal) on a 2D MRI slice, but automated systems struggle with this task. Missing plane orientation metadata can complicate analysis, increase domain shift when merging heterogeneous datasets, and reduce accuracy of diagnostic classifiers. This study develops a classifier that accurately generates plane orientation metadata. We adopt a 2.5D context-aware model that leverages multi-slice information to avoid ambiguity from isolated slices and enable robust feature learning. We train the 2.5D model on both 3D slice sequences and static 2D images. While our 2D reference model achieves 98.74% accuracy, our 2.5D method raises this to 99.49%, reducing errors by 60%, highlighting the importance of 2.5D context. We validate the utility of our generated metadata in a brain tumor detection task. A gated strategy selectively uses metadata-enhanced predictions based on uncertainty scores, boosting accuracy from 97.0% with an image-only model to 98.0%, reducing misdiagnoses by 33.3%. We integrate our plane orientation model into an interactive web application and provide it open-source.

TL;DR: LINGUAL框架使用自然语言指令指导医学图像分割，通过上下文学习将指令转化为可执行程序，自动完成分割任务，在主动域适应中比传统主动学习减少约80%标注时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主动学习在医学图像分割中仍面临边界模糊、标注劳动密集和认知负担重的问题，需要更高效的标注方式。

Method: 提出LINGUAL框架：接收专家自然语言指令，通过上下文学习转化为可执行程序，自动执行相应子任务序列，无需人工干预。

Result: 在主动域适应任务中，LINGUAL达到与传统主动学习基线相当或更优的性能，同时估计标注时间减少约80%。

Conclusion: 语言指导为医学图像分割提供了一种高效替代方案，显著降低专家标注负担，同时保持分割质量。

Abstract: Although active learning (AL) in segmentation tasks enables experts to annotate selected regions of interest (ROIs) instead of entire images, it remains highly challenging, labor-intensive, and cognitively demanding due to the blurry and ambiguous boundaries commonly observed in medical images. Also, in conventional AL, annotation effort is a function of the ROI- larger regions make the task cognitively easier but incur higher annotation costs, whereas smaller regions demand finer precision and more attention from the expert. In this context, language guidance provides an effective alternative, requiring minimal expert effort while bypassing the cognitively demanding task of precise boundary delineation in segmentation. Towards this goal, we introduce LINGUAL: a framework that receives natural language instructions from an expert, translates them into executable programs through in-context learning, and automatically performs the corresponding sequence of sub-tasks without any human intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LINGUAL in active domain adaptation (ADA) achieving comparable or superior performance to AL baselines while reducing estimated annotation time by approximately 80%.

Abstract: AI-generated image detection has become crucial with the rapid advancement of vision-generative models. Instead of training detectors tailored to specific datasets, we study a training-free approach leveraging self-supervised models without requiring prior data knowledge. These models, pre-trained with augmentations like RandomResizedCrop, learn to produce consistent representations across varying resolutions. Motivated by this, we propose WaRPAD, a training-free AI-generated image detection algorithm based on self-supervised models. Since neighborhood pixel differences in images are highly sensitive to resizing operations, WaRPAD first defines a base score function that quantifies the sensitivity of image embeddings to perturbations along high-frequency directions extracted via Haar wavelet decomposition. To simulate robustness against cropping augmentation, we rescale each image to a multiple of the models input size, divide it into smaller patches, and compute the base score for each patch. The final detection score is then obtained by averaging the scores across all patches. We validate WaRPAD on real datasets of diverse resolutions and domains, and images generated by 23 different generative models. Our method consistently achieves competitive performance and demonstrates strong robustness to test-time corruptions. Furthermore, as invariance to RandomResizedCrop is a common training scheme across self-supervised models, we show that WaRPAD is applicable across self-supervised models.

Abstract: Garment-centric fashion image generation aims to synthesize realistic and controllable human models dressing a given garment, which has attracted growing interest due to its practical applications in e-commerce. The key challenges of the task lie in two aspects: (1) faithfully preserving the garment details, and (2) gaining fine-grained controllability over the model's appearance. Existing methods typically require performing garment deformation in the generation process, which often leads to garment texture distortions. Also, they fail to control the fine-grained attributes of the generated models, due to the lack of specifically designed mechanisms. To address these issues, we propose FashionMAC, a novel diffusion-based deformation-free framework that achieves high-quality and controllable fashion showcase image generation. The core idea of our framework is to eliminate the need for performing garment deformation and directly outpaint the garment segmented from a dressed person, which enables faithful preservation of the intricate garment details. Moreover, we propose a novel region-adaptive decoupled attention (RADA) mechanism along with a chained mask injection strategy to achieve fine-grained appearance controllability over the synthesized human models. Specifically, RADA adaptively predicts the generated regions for each fine-grained text attribute and enforces the text attribute to focus on the predicted regions by a chained mask injection strategy, significantly enhancing the visual fidelity and the controllability. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of our framework compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Flood prediction is critical for emergency planning and response to mitigate human and economic losses. Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic models generate high-resolution flood maps using numerical methods requiring fine-grid discretization; which are computationally intensive and impractical for real-time large-scale applications. While recent studies have applied convolutional neural networks for flood map super-resolution with good accuracy and speed, they suffer from limited generalizability to unseen areas. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages latent diffusion models to perform super-resolution on coarse-grid flood maps, with the objective of achieving the accuracy of fine-grid flood maps while significantly reducing inference time. Experimental results demonstrate that latent diffusion models substantially decrease the computational time required to produce high-fidelity flood maps without compromising on accuracy, enabling their use in real-time flood risk management. Moreover, diffusion models exhibit superior generalizability across different physical locations, with transfer learning further accelerating adaptation to new geographic regions. Our approach also incorporates physics-informed inputs, addressing the common limitation of black-box behavior in machine learning, thereby enhancing interpretability.

Abstract: Anomaly object detection and classification are one of the main challenging tasks in computer vision and pattern recognition. In this paper, we propose a new method to automatically detect, localize and classify defects in concrete bridge structures using drone imagery. This framework is constituted of two main stages. The first stage uses saliency for defect region proposals where defects often exhibit local discontinuities in the normal surface patterns with regard to their surrounding. The second stage employs a YOLOX-based deep learning detector that operates on saliency-enhanced images obtained by applying bounding-box level brightness augmentation to salient defect regions. Experimental results on standard datasets confirm the performance of our framework and its suitability in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, which give a huge potential to be implemented in a self-powered inspection system.

Motivation: 自回归模型在图像生成中表现出强大潜力，但在通用图像编辑方面面临挑战，主要问题是条件控制弱且效率低，导致指令遵循差和视觉伪影。

Method: 提出SCAR方法，包含两个核心组件：压缩语义预填充（将高层语义编码为紧凑高效的前缀）和语义对齐引导（在自回归解码过程中对齐最后视觉隐藏状态与目标语义）。

Result: SCAR在指令编辑和可控生成基准测试中实现了卓越的视觉保真度和语义对齐，优于先前的基于AR的方法，同时保持可控性。

Conclusion: SCAR克服了基于向量量化的预填充方法的语义限制和高成本问题，在保持灵活性和通用性的同时，显著提升了自回归模型的图像编辑性能。

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive (AR) models have shown strong potential in image generation, offering better scalability and easier integration with unified multi-modal systems compared to diffusion-based methods. However, extending AR models to general image editing remains challenging due to weak and inefficient conditioning, often leading to poor instruction adherence and visual artifacts. To address this, we propose SCAR, a Semantic-Context-driven method for Autoregressive models. SCAR introduces two key components: Compressed Semantic Prefilling, which encodes high-level semantics into a compact and efficient prefix, and Semantic Alignment Guidance, which aligns the last visual hidden states with target semantics during autoregressive decoding to enhance instruction fidelity. Unlike decoding-stage injection methods, SCAR builds upon the flexibility and generality of vector-quantized-based prefilling while overcoming its semantic limitations and high cost. It generalizes across both next-token and next-set AR paradigms with minimal architectural changes. SCAR achieves superior visual fidelity and semantic alignment on both instruction editing and controllable generation benchmarks, outperforming prior AR-based methods while maintaining controllability. All code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在处理高分辨率图像时面临计算和内存成本过高的问题，现有token压缩方法缺乏高层语义理解，导致次优合并、信息冗余或上下文丢失。

Method: 使用高效分割解码器生成对象掩码作为语义先验，指导视觉token合并为紧凑的对象中心表示，并通过质心引导排序机制恢复空间顺序。

Result: 在六个权威基准测试中达到固定率压缩的最新水平，在自适应率设置下实现显著效率提升，即使仅保留2.2%的视觉token仍能维持97.4%的基线性能。

Conclusion: 对象中心表示在高效有效的LVLM处理中具有优越性，为视觉token压缩提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) usually suffer from prohibitive computational and memory costs due to the quadratic growth of visual tokens with image resolution. Existing token compression methods, while varied, often lack a high-level semantic understanding, leading to suboptimal merges, information redundancy, or context loss. To address these limitations, we introduce CORE (Compact Object-centric REpresentations), a new paradigm for visual token compression. CORE leverages an efficient segmentation decoder to generate object masks, which serve as a high-level semantic prior to guide the merging of visual tokens into a compact set of object-centric representations. Furthermore, a novel centroid-guided sorting mechanism restores a coherent spatial order to the merged tokens, preserving vital positional information. Extensive experiments show that CORE not only establishes a new state-of-the-art on six authoritative benchmarks for fixed-rate compression, but also achieves dramatic efficiency gains in adaptive-rate settings. Even under extreme compression, after aggressively retaining with only 2.2% of all visual tokens, CORE still maintains 97.4% of baseline performance. Our work demonstrates the superiority of object-centric representations for efficient and effective LVLM processing.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in medical image analysis but are fundamentally constrained by the requirement for large-scale, meticulously annotated datasets. This dependency on "big data" is a critical bottleneck in the medical domain, where patient data is inherently difficult to acquire and expert annotation is expensive, particularly for rare diseases where samples are scarce by definition. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel paradigm: Zero-Training Task-Specific Model Synthesis (ZS-TMS). Instead of adapting a pre-existing model or training a new one, our approach leverages a large-scale, pre-trained generative engine to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier. Our framework, the Semantic-Guided Parameter Synthesizer (SGPS), takes as input minimal, multi-modal task information as little as a single example image (1-shot) and a corresponding clinical text description to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier.
  The generative engine interprets these inputs to generate the weights for a lightweight, efficient classifier (e.g., an EfficientNet-V2), which can be deployed for inference immediately without any task-specific training or fine-tuning. We conduct extensive evaluations on challenging few-shot classification benchmarks derived from the ISIC 2018 skin lesion dataset and a custom rare disease dataset. Our results demonstrate that SGPS establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming advanced few-shot and zero-shot learning methods, especially in the ultra-low data regimes of 1-shot and 5-shot classification. This work paves the way for the rapid development and deployment of AI-powered diagnostic tools, particularly for the long tail of rare diseases where data is critically limited.

Motivation: 当前测量肩关节盂骨缺损的手动和半自动方法耗时且存在观察者间变异性，需要更高效可靠的自动化工具。

Method: 采用多阶段算法：U-Net分割肩关节盂和肱骨、神经网络预测盂缘点、PCA投影和圆拟合计算骨缺损百分比。

Abstract: Reliable measurement of glenoid bone loss is essential for operative planning in shoulder instability, but current manual and semi-automated methods are time-consuming and often subject to interreader variability. We developed and validated a fully automated deep learning pipeline for measuring glenoid bone loss on three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scans using a linear-based, en-face view, best-circle method. Shoulder CT images of 91 patients (average age, 40 years; range, 14-89 years; 65 men) were retrospectively collected along with manual labels including glenoid segmentation, landmarks, and bone loss measurements. The multi-stage algorithm has three main stages: (1) segmentation, where we developed a U-Net to automatically segment the glenoid and humerus; (2) anatomical landmark detection, where a second network predicts glenoid rim points; and (3) geometric fitting, where we applied principal component analysis (PCA), projection, and circle fitting to compute the percentage of bone loss. The automated measurements showed strong agreement with consensus readings and exceeded surgeon-to-surgeon consistency (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.84 vs 0.78), including in low- and high-bone-loss subgroups (ICC 0.71 vs 0.63 and 0.83 vs 0.21, respectively; P < 0.001). For classifying patients into low, medium, and high bone-loss categories, the pipeline achieved a recall of 0.714 for low and 0.857 for high severity, with no low cases misclassified as high or vice versa. These results suggest that our method is a time-efficient and clinically reliable tool for preoperative planning in shoulder instability and for screening patients with substantial glenoid bone loss.

TL;DR: 提出了DEER-3D框架，通过错误驱动的3D场景编辑生成针对性反事实数据，解决3D-LLMs在语言到视觉空间元素准确接地方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D-LLMs在准确将语言接地到3D环境中的视觉和空间元素方面存在限制，主要由于训练数据侧重于语言推理而非空间理解，且缺乏3D资源导致固有接地偏见未解决。

Method: 提出DEER-3D框架，采用"分解、诊断评估、编辑、再训练"工作流程：识别3D-LLM接地失败后，诊断具体的谓词级错误（如属性或空间关系），然后执行最小化的谓词对齐3D场景编辑（如重新着色或重新定位），生成针对性反事实监督进行迭代模型微调。

Result: 在多个3D接地和场景理解任务的基准测试中评估编辑流程，通过迭代精化在所有评估数据集上一致显示出改进。

Conclusion: DEER-3D强调了针对性、错误驱动的场景编辑在弥合3D LLMs中语言推理能力与空间接地方面的有效性。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D-LLMs, they remain limited in accurately grounding language to visual and spatial elements in 3D environments. This limitation stems in part from training data that focuses on language reasoning rather than spatial understanding due to scarce 3D resources, leaving inherent grounding biases unresolved. To address this, we propose 3D scene editing as a key mechanism to generate precise visual counterfactuals that mitigate these biases through fine-grained spatial manipulation, without requiring costly scene reconstruction or large-scale 3D data collection. Furthermore, to make these edits targeted and directly address the specific weaknesses of the model, we introduce DEER-3D, an error-driven framework following a structured "Decompose, Diagnostic Evaluation, Edit, and Re-train" workflow, rather than broadly or randomly augmenting data as in conventional approaches. Specifically, upon identifying a grounding failure of the 3D-LLM, our framework first diagnoses the exact predicate-level error (e.g., attribute or spatial relation). It then executes minimal, predicate-aligned 3D scene edits, such as recoloring or repositioning, to produce targeted counterfactual supervision for iterative model fine-tuning, significantly enhancing grounding accuracy. We evaluate our editing pipeline across multiple benchmarks for 3D grounding and scene understanding tasks, consistently demonstrating improvements across all evaluated datasets through iterative refinement. DEER-3D underscores the effectiveness of targeted, error-driven scene editing in bridging linguistic reasoning capabilities with spatial grounding in 3D LLMs.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation underpins computer-aided diagnosis and therapy by supporting clinical diagnosis, preoperative planning, and disease monitoring. While U-Net style convolutional neural networks perform well due to their encoder-decoder structures with skip connections, they struggle to capture long-range dependencies. Transformer-based variants address global context but often require heavy computation and large training datasets. This paper proposes GCA-ResUNet, an efficient segmentation network that integrates Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) into ResNet-50 residual blocks. GCA uses grouped coordinate modeling to jointly encode global dependencies across channels and spatial locations, strengthening feature representation and boundary delineation while adding minimal parameter and FLOP overhead compared with self-attention. On the Synapse dataset, GCA-ResUNet achieves a Dice score of 86.11%, and on the ACDC dataset, it reaches 92.64%, surpassing several state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining fast inference and favorable computational efficiency. These results indicate that GCA offers a practical way to enhance convolutional architectures with global modeling capability, enabling high-accuracy and resource-efficient medical image segmentation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨视角对象地理定位中由于视角和尺度差异以及复杂背景干扰导致的传统多阶段"检索-匹配"管道累积误差问题。

Method: 采用全Transformer架构，使用Swin-Transformer进行无人机和卫星图像的联合特征编码，引入网格级稀疏专家混合(GMoE)来捕获跨模态和视图内依赖关系，使用无锚检测头进行坐标回归。

Result: 在IoU=0.25和mIoU指标上达到领先性能（测试集分别为87.51%、62.50%和61.45%），显著优于DetGeo等方法。

Conclusion: SMGeo通过端到端可提示设计、共享编码、查询引导融合和网格级稀疏专家混合等技术，有效解决了跨视角对象地理定位的挑战。

Abstract: Cross-view object Geo-localization aims to precisely pinpoint the same object across large-scale satellite imagery based on drone images. Due to significant differences in viewpoint and scale, coupled with complex background interference, traditional multi-stage "retrieval-matching" pipelines are prone to cumulative errors. To address this, we present SMGeo, a promptable end-to-end transformer-based model for object Geo-localization. This model supports click prompting and can output object Geo-localization in real time when prompted to allow for interactive use. The model employs a fully transformer-based architecture, utilizing a Swin-Transformer for joint feature encoding of both drone and satellite imagery and an anchor-free transformer detection head for coordinate regression. In order to better capture both inter-modal and intra-view dependencies, we introduce a grid-level sparse Mixture-of-Experts (GMoE) into the cross-view encoder, allowing it to adaptively activate specialized experts according to the content, scale and source of each grid. We also employ an anchor-free detection head for coordinate regression, directly predicting object locations via heat-map supervision in the reference images. This approach avoids scale bias and matching complexity introduced by predefined anchor boxes. On the drone-to-satellite task, SMGeo achieves leading performance in accuracy at IoU=0.25 and mIoU metrics (e.g., 87.51%, 62.50%, and 61.45% in the test set, respectively), significantly outperforming representative methods such as DetGeo (61.97%, 57.66%, and 54.05%, respectively). Ablation studies demonstrate complementary gains from shared encoding, query-guided fusion, and grid-level sparse mixture-of-experts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出BCE3S方法，通过二元交叉熵的三部分协同学习解决长尾识别问题，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于交叉熵损失的长尾识别方法难以学习具有理想特性的特征，且在Softmax分母中耦合了不平衡的分类器向量，放大了长尾识别中的不平衡效应。

Method: BCE3S包含三个组件：基于BCE的联合学习优化分类器和样本特征；基于BCE的对比学习进一步提高特征的类内紧凑性；基于BCE的均匀学习平衡分类器向量间的可分离性。

Result: 在CIFAR10-LT、CIFAR100-LT、ImageNet-LT和iNaturalist2018等长尾数据集上实现了SOTA性能，显著提高了特征的紧凑性和可分离性。

Conclusion: BCE3S方法通过解耦特征与不平衡分类器向量的度量，在多个Sigmoid中实现了更好的特征紧凑性和可分离性，同时平衡了分类器的可分离性。

Abstract: For long-tailed recognition (LTR) tasks, high intra-class compactness and inter-class separability in both head and tail classes, as well as balanced separability among all the classifier vectors, are preferred. The existing LTR methods based on cross-entropy (CE) loss not only struggle to learn features with desirable properties but also couple imbalanced classifier vectors in the denominator of its Softmax, amplifying the imbalance effects in LTR. In this paper, for the LTR, we propose a binary cross-entropy (BCE)-based tripartite synergistic learning, termed BCE3S, which consists of three components: (1) BCE-based joint learning optimizes both the classifier and sample features, which achieves better compactness and separability among features than the CE-based joint learning, by decoupling the metrics between feature and the imbalanced classifier vectors in multiple Sigmoid; (2) BCE-based contrastive learning further improves the intra-class compactness of features; (3) BCE-based uniform learning balances the separability among classifier vectors and interactively enhances the feature properties by combining with the joint learning. The extensive experiments show that the LTR model trained by BCE3S not only achieves higher compactness and separability among sample features, but also balances the classifier's separability, achieving SOTA performance on various long-tailed datasets such as CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018.

TL;DR: FAPE-IR是一个频率感知规划执行框架，通过冻结的多模态大语言模型分析退化图像生成频率感知修复计划，指导基于扩散的LoRA-MoE执行器进行动态频率选择，实现统一的多任务图像修复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的一体化图像修复方法依赖任务特定设计或潜在路由策略，难以适应现实世界中复杂多样的退化情况，需要更统一和可解释的解决方案。

Method: 使用冻结MLLM作为规划器生成频率感知修复计划，通过LoRA-MoE模块在扩散执行器中动态选择高频或低频专家，结合对抗训练和频率正则化损失提升质量。

Result: 在七个修复任务上达到最先进性能，并在混合退化条件下表现出强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过语义规划与基于频率的修复相结合，FAPE-IR为一体化图像修复提供了统一且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AIO-IR) aims to develop a unified model that can handle multiple degradations under complex conditions. However, existing methods often rely on task-specific designs or latent routing strategies, making it hard to adapt to real-world scenarios with various degradations. We propose FAPE-IR, a Frequency-Aware Planning and Execution framework for image restoration. It uses a frozen Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a planner to analyze degraded images and generate concise, frequency-aware restoration plans. These plans guide a LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts (LoRA-MoE) module within a diffusion-based executor, which dynamically selects high- or low-frequency experts, complemented by frequency features of the input image. To further improve restoration quality and reduce artifacts, we introduce adversarial training and a frequency regularization loss. By coupling semantic planning with frequency-based restoration, FAPE-IR offers a unified and interpretable solution for all-in-one image restoration. Extensive experiments show that FAPE-IR achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven restoration tasks and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization under mixed degradations.

*Yiqing Shen,Chenjia Li,Mathias Unberath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RIVER是一个基于推理的视频编辑模型，能够通过多跳推理理解隐式查询来推断编辑目标，然后执行视频修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法需要用户提供精确的空间位置和时间边界描述，这在用户试图通过引用语义属性或对象关系的隐式查询来概念化编辑时变得不切实际。

Method: RIVER通过数字孪生表示解耦推理和生成，使用大型语言模型进行多跳推理，然后输出结构化指令指导基于扩散的编辑器执行像素级修改，训练采用强化学习评估推理准确性和生成质量。

Result: RIVER在提出的RVEBenchmark上表现最佳，并在VegGIE和FiVE两个额外视频编辑基准测试中超越了六种基线方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: RIVER成功解决了推理视频编辑这一复杂任务，能够有效处理隐式查询，为文本驱动视频编辑提供了新的能力。

Abstract: Text-driven video editing enables users to modify video content only using text queries. While existing methods can modify video content if explicit descriptions of editing targets with precise spatial locations and temporal boundaries are provided, these requirements become impractical when users attempt to conceptualize edits through implicit queries referencing semantic properties or object relationships. We introduce reasoning video editing, a task where video editing models must interpret implicit queries through multi-hop reasoning to infer editing targets before executing modifications, and a first model attempting to solve this complex task, RIVER (Reasoning-based Implicit Video Editor). RIVER decouples reasoning from generation through digital twin representations of video content that preserve spatial relationships, temporal trajectories, and semantic attributes. A large language model then processes this representation jointly with the implicit query, performing multi-hop reasoning to determine modifications, then outputs structured instructions that guide a diffusion-based editor to execute pixel-level changes. RIVER training uses reinforcement learning with rewards that evaluate reasoning accuracy and generation quality. Finally, we introduce RVEBenchmark, a benchmark of 100 videos with 519 implicit queries spanning three levels and categories of reasoning complexity specifically for reasoning video editing. RIVER demonstrates best performance on the proposed RVEBenchmark and also achieves state-of-the-art performance on two additional video editing benchmarks (VegGIE and FiVE), where it surpasses six baseline methods.

Conclusion: RTS-Mono成功实现了高性能与高效率的平衡，为自监督单目深度估计在实际应用中的部署提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Depth information is crucial for autonomous driving and intelligent robot navigation. The simplicity and flexibility of self-supervised monocular depth estimation are conducive to its role in these fields. However, most existing monocular depth estimation models consume many computing resources. Although some methods have reduced the model's size and improved computing efficiency, the performance deteriorates, seriously hindering the real-world deployment of self-supervised monocular depth estimation models in the real world. To address this problem, we proposed a real-time self-supervised monocular depth estimation method and implemented it in the real world. It is called RTS-Mono, which is a lightweight and efficient encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder is based on Lite-Encoder, and the decoder is designed with a multi-scale sparse fusion framework to minimize redundancy, ensure performance, and improve inference speed. RTS-Mono achieved state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance in high and low resolutions with extremely low parameter counts (3 M) in experiments based on the KITTI dataset. Compared with lightweight methods, RTS-Mono improved Abs Rel and Sq Rel by 5.6% and 9.8% at low resolution and improved Sq Rel and RMSE by 6.1% and 1.9% at high resolution. In real-world deployment experiments, RTS-Mono has extremely high accuracy and can perform real-time inference on Nvidia Jetson Orin at a speed of 49 FPS.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于不对称聚合和几何约束的视觉地点识别方法A²GC-VPR，通过行-列归一化平均和单独边缘校准来处理图像特征与聚类中心分布差异问题，并引入可学习坐标嵌入增强空间感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的最优传输聚合方法对称处理源和目标边缘分布，当图像特征和聚类中心分布差异显著时效果受限，需要开发能够适应分布差异的不对称匹配方法。

Method: 采用行-列归一化平均与单独边缘校准实现不对称匹配，引入可学习坐标嵌入计算兼容性分数并与特征相似性融合，促进空间邻近特征分配到同一聚类。

Result: 在MSLS、NordLand和Pittsburgh数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在匹配精度和鲁棒性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: A²GC-VPR方法通过不对称聚合和几何约束有效提升了视觉地点识别的性能，验证了处理分布差异和增强空间感知的重要性。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) aims to match query images against a database using visual cues. State-of-the-art methods aggregate features from deep backbones to form global descriptors. Optimal transport-based aggregation methods reformulate feature-to-cluster assignment as a transport problem, but the standard Sinkhorn algorithm symmetrically treats source and target marginals, limiting effectiveness when image features and cluster centers exhibit substantially different distributions. We propose an asymmetric aggregation VPR method with geometric constraints for locally aggregated descriptors, called $A^2$GC-VPR. Our method employs row-column normalization averaging with separate marginal calibration, enabling asymmetric matching that adapts to distributional discrepancies in visual place recognition. Geometric constraints are incorporated through learnable coordinate embeddings, computing compatibility scores fused with feature similarities, thereby promoting spatially proximal features to the same cluster and enhancing spatial awareness. Experimental results on MSLS, NordLand, and Pittsburgh datasets demonstrate superior performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach in improving matching accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a range of computer vision tasks; however, their high computational, memory, and energy demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained platforms. In this paper, we propose \emph{Cascaded-ViT (CViT)}, a lightweight and compute-efficient vision transformer architecture featuring a novel feedforward network design called \emph{Cascaded-Chunk Feed Forward Network (CCFFN)}. By splitting input features, CCFFN improves parameter and FLOP efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments on ImageNet-1K show that our \emph{CViT-XL} model achieves 75.5\% Top-1 accuracy while reducing FLOPs by 15\% and energy consumption by 3.3\% compared to EfficientViT-M5. Across various model sizes, the CViT family consistently exhibits the lowest energy consumption, making it suitable for deployment on battery-constrained devices such as mobile phones and drones. Furthermore, when evaluated using a new metric called \emph{Accuracy-Per-FLOP (APF)}, which quantifies compute efficiency relative to accuracy, CViT models consistently achieve top-ranking efficiency. Particularly, CViT-L is 2.2\% more accurate than EfficientViT-M2 while having comparable APF scores.

Motivation: 当前文本到图像扩散模型在微调时容易学习用户数据中的不良概念，并与用户提示产生纠缠，这在偏见缓解、防止恶意适应、属性解缠等下游任务中至关重要。

Method: Coffee方法的核心是防止用户提示的嵌入与不希望学习的概念对齐，通过语言描述来指定不良概念以正则化适应过程，无需额外训练且允许通过修改文本描述灵活调整不良概念。

Result: 实验结果表明，Coffee能够有效防止文本到图像模型在微调过程中学习指定的不良概念，并且在性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Coffee提供了一种有效的方法来可控地微调文本到图像扩散模型，通过语言描述防止模型学习不良概念，具有灵活性和无需额外训练的优势。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can generate diverse content with flexible prompts, which makes them well-suited for customization through fine-tuning with a small amount of user-provided data. However, controllable fine-tuning that prevents models from learning undesired concepts present in the fine-tuning data, and from entangling those concepts with user prompts, remains an open challenge. It is crucial for downstream tasks like bias mitigation, preventing malicious adaptation, attribute disentanglement, and generalizable fine-tuning of diffusion policy. We propose Coffee that allows using language to specify undesired concepts to regularize the adaptation process. The crux of our method lies in keeping the embeddings of the user prompt from aligning with undesired concepts. Crucially, Coffee requires no additional training and enables flexible modification of undesired concepts by modifying textual descriptions. We evaluate Coffee by fine-tuning on images associated with user prompts paired with undesired concepts. Experimental results demonstrate that Coffee can prevent text-to-image models from learning specified undesired concepts during fine-tuning and outperforms existing methods. Code will be released upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频系统只能检测事故是否发生，但无法深入分析行人行为的不同认知阶段，需要系统化的多视角分析方法来理解事故发展过程。

Method: 四阶段框架：事件触发多视角视频采集、行人行为阶段分割、阶段特异性多视角推理、层次化合成和诊断推理，使用两个专用VLM模型进行阶段分割和多视角分析。

Result: TG-VLM阶段分割mIoU达0.4881，PhaVR-VLM字幕评分33.063，问答准确率最高64.70%，在Woven Traffic Safety数据集上验证了框架有效性。

Conclusion: MP-PVIR成功将多视角视频数据转化为可操作的洞察，推进了车路协同系统中AI驱动的交通安全分析。

Abstract: Pedestrian-vehicle incidents remain a critical urban safety challenge, with pedestrians accounting for over 20% of global traffic fatalities. Although existing video-based systems can detect when incidents occur, they provide little insight into how these events unfold across the distinct cognitive phases of pedestrian behavior. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for video understanding, but they remain limited in that they typically process videos in isolation, without explicit temporal structuring or multi-view integration. This paper introduces Multi-view Phase-aware Pedestrian-Vehicle Incident Reasoning (MP-PVIR), a unified framework that systematically processes multi-view video streams into structured diagnostic reports through four stages: (1) event-triggered multi-view video acquisition, (2) pedestrian behavior phase segmentation, (3) phase-specific multi-view reasoning, and (4) hierarchical synthesis and diagnostic reasoning. The framework operationalizes behavioral theory by automatically segmenting incidents into cognitive phases, performing synchronized multi-view analysis within each phase, and synthesizing results into causal chains with targeted prevention strategies. Particularly, two specialized VLMs underpin the MP-PVIR pipeline: TG-VLM for behavioral phase segmentation (mIoU = 0.4881) and PhaVR-VLM for phase-aware multi-view analysis, achieving a captioning score of 33.063 and up to 64.70% accuracy on question answering. Finally, a designated large language model is used to generate comprehensive reports detailing scene understanding, behavior interpretation, causal reasoning, and prevention recommendations. Evaluation on the Woven Traffic Safety dataset shows that MP-PVIR effectively translates multi-view video data into actionable insights, advancing AI-driven traffic safety analytics for vehicle-infrastructure cooperative systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了卷积最近邻（ConvNN）框架，将卷积和自注意力统一在k最近邻聚合框架中，揭示了它们都是邻居选择和聚合的特殊情况，只是选择标准不同（空间邻近vs特征相似性）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CNN和Transformer重塑了计算机视觉，但卷积和自注意力通常被视为根本不同的架构。作者认为这两种操作可以在统一的k最近邻聚合框架下理解，它们只是邻居选择标准的不同。

Method: 提出ConvNN框架，将卷积和注意力形式化为邻居选择和聚合操作。卷积基于空间邻近选择邻居，注意力基于特征相似性选择邻居。该框架可作为卷积层和注意力层的即插即用替代品。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上的实验验证：1）VGG中的混合分支结合空间邻近和特征相似性选择提高了两个数据集的准确率；2）ViT中的ConvNN优于标准注意力和其他注意力变体。消融实验显示在频谱中间插值具有正则化效果。

Conclusion: ConvNN提供了一个统一框架，消除了卷积和注意力之间的明显区别，为设计更原则性和可解释的视觉架构提供了启示。

Abstract: The shift from Convolutional Neural Networks to Transformers has reshaped computer vision, yet these two architectural families are typically viewed as fundamentally distinct. We argue that convolution and self-attention, despite their apparent differences, can be unified within a single k-nearest neighbor aggregation framework. The critical insight is that both operations are special cases of neighbor selection and aggregation; convolution selects neighbors by spatial proximity, while attention selects by feature similarity, revealing they exist on a continuous spectrum. We introduce Convolutional Nearest Neighbors (ConvNN), a unified framework that formalizes this connection. Crucially, ConvNN serves as a drop-in replacement for convolutional and attention layers, enabling systematic exploration of the intermediate spectrum between these two extremes. We validate the framework's coherence on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 classification tasks across two complementary architectures: (1) Hybrid branching in VGG improves accuracy on both CIFAR datasets by combining spatial-proximity and feature-similarity selection; and (2) ConvNN in ViT outperforms standard attention and other attention variants on both datasets. Extensive ablations on $k$ values and architectural variants reveal that interpolating along this spectrum provides regularization benefits by balancing local and global receptive fields. Our work provides a unifying framework that dissolves the apparent distinction between convolution and attention, with implications for designing more principled and interpretable vision architectures.

Conclusion: 通过专门的数据集和模型设计，可以有效提升大视觉语言模型对抽象手绘草图的理解能力，填补了现有模型在这一重要模态上的能力空白。

Abstract: While Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, their ability to interpret abstract visual inputs remains limited. Specifically, they struggle to comprehend hand-drawn sketches, a modality that offers an intuitive means of expressing concepts that are difficult to describe textually. We identify the primary bottleneck as the absence of a large-scale dataset that jointly models sketches, photorealistic images, and corresponding natural language instructions. To address this, we present two key contributions: (1) a new, large-scale dataset of image-sketch-instruction triplets designed to facilitate both pretraining and instruction tuning, and (2) O3SLM, an LVLM trained on this dataset. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple sketch-based tasks: (a) object localization, (b) counting, (c) image retrieval i.e., (SBIR and fine-grained SBIR), and (d) visual question answering (VQA); while incorporating the three existing sketch datasets, namely QuickDraw!, Sketchy, and Tu Berlin, along with our generated SketchVCL dataset, show that O3SLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially outperforming existing LVLMs in sketch comprehension and reasoning.

Conclusion: SMART通过整合音频线索和镜头级时间结构，有效提升了视频时刻检索的性能，证明了多模态融合和细粒度时间建模的重要性。

Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval is a task in video understanding that aims to localize a specific temporal segment in an untrimmed video based on a natural language query. Despite recent progress in moment retrieval from videos using both traditional techniques and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), most existing methods still rely on coarse temporal understanding and a single visual modality, limiting performance on complex videos. To address this, we introduce \textit{S}hot-aware \textit{M}ultimodal \textit{A}udio-enhanced \textit{R}etrieval of \textit{T}emporal \textit{S}egments (SMART), an MLLM-based framework that integrates audio cues and leverages shot-level temporal structure. SMART enriches multimodal representations by combining audio and visual features while applying \textbf{Shot-aware Token Compression}, which selectively retains high-information tokens within each shot to reduce redundancy and preserve fine-grained temporal details. We also refine prompt design to better utilize audio-visual cues. Evaluations on Charades-STA and QVHighlights show that SMART achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, including a 1.61\% increase in R1@0.5 and 2.59\% gain in R1@0.7 on Charades-STA.

Abstract: Recent trends in SLAM and visual navigation have embraced 3D Gaussians as the preferred scene representation, highlighting the importance of estimating camera poses from a single image using a pre-built Gaussian model. However, existing approaches typically rely on an iterative \textit{render-compare-refine} loop, where candidate views are first rendered using NeRF or Gaussian Splatting, then compared against the target image, and finally, discrepancies are used to update the pose. This multi-round process incurs significant computational overhead, hindering real-time performance in robotics. In this paper, we propose iGaussian, a two-stage feed-forward framework that achieves real-time camera pose estimation through direct 3D Gaussian inversion. Our method first regresses a coarse 6DoF pose using a Gaussian Scene Prior-based Pose Regression Network with spatial uniform sampling and guided attention mechanisms, then refines it through feature matching and multi-model fusion. The key contribution lies in our cross-correlation module that aligns image embeddings with 3D Gaussian attributes without differentiable rendering, coupled with a Weighted Multiview Predictor that fuses features from Multiple strategically sampled viewpoints. Experimental results on the NeRF Synthetic, Mip-NeRF 360, and T\&T+DB datasets demonstrate a significant performance improvement over previous methods, reducing median rotation errors to 0.2° while achieving 2.87 FPS tracking on mobile robots, which is an impressive 10 times speedup compared to optimization-based approaches.

Abstract: We present Wave-Former, a novel method capable of high-accuracy 3D shape reconstruction for completely occluded, diverse, everyday objects. This capability can open new applications spanning robotics, augmented reality, and logistics. Our approach leverages millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless signals, which can penetrate common occlusions and reflect off hidden objects. In contrast to past mmWave reconstruction methods, which suffer from limited coverage and high noise, Wave-Former introduces a physics-aware shape completion model capable of inferring full 3D geometry. At the heart of Wave-Former's design is a novel three-stage pipeline which bridges raw wireless signals with recent advancements in vision-based shape completion by incorporating physical properties of mmWave signals. The pipeline proposes candidate geometric surfaces, employs a transformer-based shape completion model designed specifically for mmWave signals, and finally performs entropy-guided surface selection. This enables Wave-Former to be trained using entirely synthetic point-clouds, while demonstrating impressive generalization to real-world data.In head-to-head comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines, Wave-Former raises recall from 54% to 72% while maintaining a high precision of 85%.

TL;DR: 提出RiSe框架解决多模态人脸反欺骗中的跨域泛化问题，通过非对称不变风险最小化和多模态协同解耦来应对表示风险和协同风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态人脸反欺骗方法在未见域中性能下降比单模态更严重，主要由于模态表示不变性风险和模态协同不变性风险这两个被忽视的跨域泛化问题。

Method: RiSe框架包含两个核心组件：1) 非对称不变风险最小化(AsyIRM)，在径向空间学习不变球形决策边界；2) 多模态协同解耦(MMSD)，通过跨样本混合和解耦增强内在模态特征。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明RiSe实现了最先进的跨域性能。

Conclusion: RiSe框架有效解决了多模态人脸反欺骗中的跨域泛化挑战，为处理模态表示和协同不变性风险提供了理论保证的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) methods, which integrate multiple visual modalities, often suffer even more severe performance degradation than unimodal FAS when deployed in unseen domains. This is mainly due to two overlooked risks that affect cross-domain multimodal generalization. The first is the modal representation invariant risk, i.e., whether representations remain generalizable under domain shift. We theoretically show that the inherent class asymmetry in FAS (diverse spoofs vs. compact reals) enlarges the upper bound of generalization error, and this effect is further amplified in multimodal settings. The second is the modal synergy invariant risk, where models overfit to domain-specific inter-modal correlations. Such spurious synergy cannot generalize to unseen attacks in target domains, leading to performance drops. To solve these issues, we propose a provable framework, namely Multimodal Representation and Synergy Invariance Learning (RiSe). For representation risk, RiSe introduces Asymmetric Invariant Risk Minimization (AsyIRM), which learns an invariant spherical decision boundary in radial space to fit asymmetric distributions, while preserving domain cues in angular space. For synergy risk, RiSe employs Multimodal Synergy Disentanglement (MMSD), a self-supervised task enhancing intrinsic, generalizable modal features via cross-sample mixing and disentanglement. Theoretical analysis and experiments verify RiSe, which achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain performance.

TL;DR: MVI-Bench是首个专门评估误导性视觉输入对大型视觉语言模型鲁棒性影响的基准测试，包含1,248个专家标注的VQA实例，并提出了细粒度评估指标MVI-Sensitivity。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有鲁棒性基准主要关注幻觉或误导性文本输入，而忽略了误导性视觉输入对视觉理解评估的同等重要挑战。

Method: 基于基础视觉原语，设计了三个层次误导性视觉输入分类：视觉概念、视觉属性和视觉关系，并构建了六个代表性类别的数据集。

Result: 对18个最先进LVLM的实证研究揭示了它们对误导性视觉输入的显著脆弱性。

Conclusion: MVI-Bench的深入分析为开发更可靠和鲁棒的LVLM提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: Evaluating the robustness of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) is essential for their continued development and responsible deployment in real-world applications. However, existing robustness benchmarks typically focus on hallucination or misleading textual inputs, while largely overlooking the equally critical challenge posed by misleading visual inputs in assessing visual understanding. To fill this important gap, we introduce MVI-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark specially designed for evaluating how Misleading Visual Inputs undermine the robustness of LVLMs. Grounded in fundamental visual primitives, the design of MVI-Bench centers on three hierarchical levels of misleading visual inputs: Visual Concept, Visual Attribute, and Visual Relationship. Using this taxonomy, we curate six representative categories and compile 1,248 expertly annotated VQA instances. To facilitate fine-grained robustness evaluation, we further introduce MVI-Sensitivity, a novel metric that characterizes LVLM robustness at a granular level. Empirical results across 18 state-of-the-art LVLMs uncover pronounced vulnerabilities to misleading visual inputs, and our in-depth analyses on MVI-Bench provide actionable insights that can guide the development of more reliable and robust LVLMs. The benchmark and codebase can be accessed at https://github.com/chenyil6/MVI-Bench.

TL;DR: 提出一种对象级token压缩策略，通过自适应token合并来减少MLLMs中的图像token数量，仅用10%的token就能达到原始模型96%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统patch级token化导致图像token数量二次增长，增加计算和内存负担，且与人类视觉认知系统不一致，导致幻觉和计算冗余。

Method: 提出对象级token合并策略进行自适应token压缩，与人类视觉系统保持一致。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，平均仅使用10%的token就能达到原始模型96%的性能，在压缩比和性能平衡方面优于相关方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了MLLMs中图像token过多的问题，实现了高效的token压缩，同时保持良好性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated substantial value in unified text-image understanding and reasoning, primarily by converting images into sequences of patch-level tokens that align with their architectural paradigm. However, patch-level tokenization leads to a quadratic growth in image tokens, burdening MLLMs' understanding and reasoning with enormous computation and memory. Additionally, the traditional patch-wise scanning tokenization workflow misaligns with the human vision cognition system, further leading to hallucination and computational redundancy. To address this issue, we propose an object-level token merging strategy for Adaptive Token compression, revealing the consistency with human vision system. The experiments are conducted on multiple comprehensive benchmarks, which show that our approach averagely, utilizes only 10% tokens while achieving almost 96% of the vanilla model's performance. More extensive experimental results in comparison with relevant works demonstrate the superiority of our method in balancing compression ratio and performance. Our code will be available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DoGCLR是一种基于博弈论的自监督对比学习框架，用于基于骨架的动作识别。它通过时空双权重定位机制识别关键运动区域，并采用熵驱动优势策略管理负样本，在多个数据集上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自监督对比学习方法在处理骨架区域时采用统一方式，并使用FIFO队列存储负样本，导致运动信息丢失和负样本选择不优。

Conclusion: DoGCLR通过博弈论框架有效解决了现有方法中的运动信息丢失和负样本选择问题，在多个数据集上表现出优异的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Existing self-supervised contrastive learning methods for skeleton-based action recognition often process all skeleton regions uniformly, and adopt a first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue to store negative samples, which leads to motion information loss and non-optimal negative sample selection. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Dominance-Game Contrastive Learning network for skeleton-based action Recognition (DoGCLR), a self-supervised framework based on game theory. DoGCLR models the construction of positive and negative samples as a dynamic Dominance Game, where both sample types interact to reach an equilibrium that balances semantic preservation and discriminative strength. Specifically, a spatio-temporal dual weight localization mechanism identifies key motion regions and guides region-wise augmentations to enhance motion diversity while maintaining semantics. In parallel, an entropy-driven dominance strategy manages the memory bank by retaining high entropy (hard) negatives and replacing low-entropy (weak) ones, ensuring consistent exposure to informative contrastive signals. Extensive experiments are conducted on NTU RGB+D and PKU-MMD datasets. On NTU RGB+D 60 X-Sub/X-View, DoGCLR achieves 81.1%/89.4% accuracy, and on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Sub/X-Set, DoGCLR achieves 71.2%/75.5% accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 0.1%, 2.7%, 1.1%, and 2.3%, respectively. On PKU-MMD Part I/Part II, DoGCLR performs comparably to the state-of-the-art methods and achieves a 1.9% higher accuracy on Part II, highlighting its strong robustness on more challenging scenarios.

TL;DR: UniSER是一个基础性的通用模型，能够在一个框架内处理由软效应（如镜头光晕、雾霾、阴影、反射）引起的多种图像退化问题，通过大规模数据集和定制训练流程显著优于专业模型和通用模型。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法针对软效应退化问题开发了高度专业化的模型，但缺乏可扩展性且未能利用这些修复问题的共享本质。同时，通用模型需要详细提示且在这些细粒度任务上表现不佳。

Method: 构建包含380万对数据的大规模数据集，包括新颖的物理合理数据填补公共基准的关键空白；定制训练流程，微调扩散变换器从多样化数据中学习鲁棒修复先验，集成细粒度掩码和强度控制。

Conclusion: 通过利用软效应的共同本质（半透明遮挡）和协同方法，UniSER证明了在单一框架内处理多样化软效应退化的可行性，为图像修复提供了新的基础模型。

Abstract: Digital images are often degraded by soft effects such as lens flare, haze, shadows, and reflections, which reduce aesthetics even though the underlying pixels remain partially visible. The prevailing works address these degradations in isolation, developing highly specialized, specialist models that lack scalability and fail to exploit the shared underlying essences of these restoration problems. While specialist models are limited, recent large-scale pretrained generalist models offer powerful, text-driven image editing capabilities. while recent general-purpose systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Flux Kontext, Nano Banana) require detailed prompts and often fail to achieve robust removal on these fine-grained tasks or preserve identity of the scene. Leveraging the common essence of soft effects, i.e., semi-transparent occlusions, we introduce a foundational versatile model UniSER, capable of addressing diverse degradations caused by soft effects within a single framework. Our methodology centers on curating a massive 3.8M-pair dataset to ensure robustness and generalization, which includes novel, physically-plausible data to fill critical gaps in public benchmarks, and a tailored training pipeline that fine-tunes a Diffusion Transformer to learn robust restoration priors from this diverse data, integrating fine-grained mask and strength controls. This synergistic approach allows UniSER to significantly outperform both specialist and generalist models, achieving robust, high-fidelity restoration in the wild.

Motivation: 现有图像分词方法使用局部监督进行语义监督，限制了语义分布的均匀性。而VA-VAE证明更均匀的特征分布能带来更好的生成性能。

Method: 提出代码本直方图关系学习方法将预训练模型在整个数据集上建模的语义转移到语义代码本，并设计残差学习模块恢复细粒度细节以减少量化带来的重建误差。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k基准测试中实现了最先进的重建性能和生成质量。

Conclusion: GloTok通过全局关系建模产生更均匀分布的语义潜在表示，有助于自回归模型训练生成高质量图像，且训练过程中无需直接访问预训练模型。

Abstract: Existing state-of-the-art image tokenization methods leverage diverse semantic features from pre-trained vision models for additional supervision, to expand the distribution of latent representations and thereby improve the quality of image reconstruction and generation. These methods employ a locally supervised approach for semantic supervision, which limits the uniformity of semantic distribution. However, VA-VAE proves that a more uniform feature distribution yields better generation performance. In this work, we introduce a Global Perspective Tokenizer (GloTok), which utilizes global relational information to model a more uniform semantic distribution of tokenized features. Specifically, a codebook-wise histogram relation learning method is proposed to transfer the semantics, which are modeled by pre-trained models on the entire dataset, to the semantic codebook. Then, we design a residual learning module that recovers the fine-grained details to minimize the reconstruction error caused by quantization. Through the above design, GloTok delivers more uniformly distributed semantic latent representations, which facilitates the training of autoregressive (AR) models for generating high-quality images without requiring direct access to pre-trained models during the training process. Experiments on the standard ImageNet-1k benchmark clearly show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance and generation quality.

Abstract: Most existing autonomous-driving datasets (e.g., KITTI, nuScenes, and the Waymo Perception Dataset), collected by human-driving mode or unidentified driving mode, can only serve as early training for the perception and prediction of autonomous vehicles (AVs). To evaluate the real behavioral safety of AVs controlled in the black box, we present the first end-to-end benchmark dataset collected entirely by autonomous-driving mode in the real world. This dataset contains over 100 hours of naturalistic data from multiple production autonomous-driving vehicle models in the market. We segment the original data into 32,727 key frames, each consisting of four synchronized camera images and high-precision GNSS/IMU data (0.8 cm localization accuracy). For each key frame, 20 Hz vehicle trajectories spanning the past 6 s and future 5 s are provided, along with detailed 2D annotations of surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, traffic lights, and traffic signs. These key frames have rich scenario-level attributes, including driver intent, area type (covering highways, urban roads, and residential areas), lighting (day, night, or dusk), weather (clear or rain), road surface (paved or unpaved), traffic and vulnerable road users (VRU) density, traffic lights, and traffic signs (warning, prohibition, and indication). To evaluate the safety of AVs, we employ an end-to-end motion planning model that predicts vehicle trajectories with an Average Displacement Error (ADE) of 1.4 m on autonomous-driving frames. The dataset continues to expand by over 10 hours of new data weekly, thereby providing a sustainable foundation for research on AV driving behavior analysis and safety evaluation.

Conclusion: UMEG-Net通过统一图表示和多模态蒸馏，在有限标注数据下实现了鲁棒的精确事件识别性能。

Abstract: Precise event spotting (PES) aims to recognize fine-grained events at exact moments and has become a key component of sports analytics. This task is particularly challenging due to rapid succession, motion blur, and subtle visual differences. Consequently, most existing methods rely on domain-specific, end-to-end training with large labeled datasets and often struggle in few-shot conditions due to their dependence on pixel- or pose-based inputs alone. However, obtaining large labeled datasets is practically hard. We propose a Unified Multi-Entity Graph Network (UMEG-Net) for few-shot PES. UMEG-Net integrates human skeletons and sport-specific object keypoints into a unified graph and features an efficient spatio-temporal extraction module based on advanced GCN and multi-scale temporal shift. To further enhance performance, we employ multimodal distillation to transfer knowledge from keypoint-based graphs to visual representations. Our approach achieves robust performance with limited labeled data and significantly outperforms baseline models in few-shot settings, providing a scalable and effective solution for few-shot PES. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/LZYAndy/UMEG-Net.

Abstract: The aorta, the body's largest artery, is prone to pathologies such as dissection, aneurysm, and atherosclerosis, which often require timely intervention. Minimally invasive repairs involving branch vessels necessitate detailed 3D anatomical analysis. Existing methods often overlook hierarchical anatomical relationships while struggling with severe class imbalance inherent in vascular structures. We address these challenges with a curriculum learning strategy that leverages a novel fractal softmax for hierarchical semantic learning. Inspired by human cognition, our approach progressively learns anatomical constraints by decomposing complex structures from simple to complex components. The curriculum learning framework naturally addresses class imbalance by first establishing robust feature representations for dominant classes before tackling rare but anatomically critical structures, significantly accelerating model convergence in multi-class scenarios. Our two-stage inference strategy achieves up to fivefold acceleration, enhancing clinical practicality. On the validation set at epoch 50, our hierarchical semantic loss improves the Dice score of nnU-Net ResEnc M by 11.65%. The proposed model demonstrates a 5.6% higher Dice score than baselines on the test set. Experimental results show significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and efficiency, making the framework suitable for real-time clinical applications. The implementation code for this challenge entry is publicly available at: https://github.com/PengchengShi1220/AortaSeg24.

Abstract: High-quality data has become a primary driver of progress under scale laws, with curated datasets often outperforming much larger unfiltered ones at lower cost. Online data curation extends this idea by dynamically selecting training samples based on the model's evolving state. While effective in classification and multimodal learning, existing online sampling strategies rarely extend to object detection because of its structural complexity and domain gaps. We introduce DetGain, an online data curation method specifically for object detection that estimates the marginal perturbation of each image to dataset-level Average Precision (AP) based on its prediction quality. By modeling global score distributions, DetGain efficiently estimates the global AP change and computes teacher-student contribution gaps to select informative samples at each iteration. The method is architecture-agnostic and minimally intrusive, enabling straightforward integration into diverse object detection architectures. Experiments on the COCO dataset with multiple representative detectors show consistent improvements in accuracy. DetGain also demonstrates strong robustness under low-quality data and can be effectively combined with knowledge distillation techniques to further enhance performance, highlighting its potential as a general and complementary strategy for data-efficient object detection.

Result: 在三个基准测试上的实验表明，MCFormer达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: MCFormer通过建模多尺度相关性有效抑制了船舶重识别中的异常样本影响，显著提升了识别性能

Abstract: Maritime vessel re-identification (Re-ID) plays a crucial role in advancing maritime monitoring and intelligent situational awareness systems. However, some existing vessel Re-ID methods are directly adapted from pedestrian-focused algorithms, making them ill-suited for mitigating the unique problems present in vessel images, particularly the greater intra-identity variations and more severe missing of local parts, which lead to the emergence of outlier samples within the same identity. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-scale Correlation-aware Transformer Network (MCFormer), which explicitly models multi-scale correlations across the entire input set to suppress the adverse effects of outlier samples with intra-identity variations or local missing, incorporating two novel modules, the Global Correlation Module (GCM), and the Local Correlation Module (LCM). Specifically, GCM constructs a global similarity affinity matrix across all input images to model global correlations through feature aggregation based on inter-image consistency, rather than solely learning features from individual images as in most existing approaches. Simultaneously, LCM mines and aligns local features of positive samples with contextual similarity to extract local correlations by maintaining a dynamic memory bank, effectively compensating for missing or occluded regions in individual images. To further enhance feature robustness, MCFormer integrates global and local features that have been respectively correlated across multiple scales, effectively capturing latent relationships among image features. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that MCFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: 扩散基视频重建与实时、交互式、可编辑的流媒体场景兼容，使高质量视频恢复成为现代视觉系统的实用组件。

Abstract: Video inverse problems are fundamental to streaming, telepresence, and AR/VR, where high perceptual quality must coexist with tight latency constraints. Diffusion-based priors currently deliver state-of-the-art reconstructions, but existing approaches either adapt image diffusion models with ad hoc temporal regularizers - leading to temporal artifacts - or rely on native video diffusion models whose iterative posterior sampling is far too slow for real-time use. We introduce InstantViR, an amortized inference framework for ultra-fast video reconstruction powered by a pre-trained video diffusion prior. We distill a powerful bidirectional video diffusion model (teacher) into a causal autoregressive student that maps a degraded video directly to its restored version in a single forward pass, inheriting the teacher's strong temporal modeling while completely removing iterative test-time optimization. The distillation is prior-driven: it only requires the teacher diffusion model and known degradation operators, and does not rely on externally paired clean/noisy video data. To further boost throughput, we replace the video-diffusion backbone VAE with a high-efficiency LeanVAE via an innovative teacher-space regularized distillation scheme, enabling low-latency latent-space processing. Across streaming random inpainting, Gaussian deblurring and super-resolution, InstantViR matches or surpasses the reconstruction quality of diffusion-based baselines while running at over 35 FPS on NVIDIA A100 GPUs, achieving up to 100 times speedups over iterative video diffusion solvers. These results show that diffusion-based video reconstruction is compatible with real-time, interactive, editable, streaming scenarios, turning high-quality video restoration into a practical component of modern vision systems.

Conclusion: 测量约束采样方法能够有效实现盲人脸恢复中的多样化重建，解决了现有方法在捕捉一对多性质方面的局限性。

Abstract: Blind face restoration (BFR) may correspond to multiple plausible high-quality (HQ) reconstructions under extremely low-quality (LQ) inputs. However, existing methods typically produce deterministic results, struggling to capture this one-to-many nature. In this paper, we propose a Measurement-Constrained Sampling (MCS) approach that enables diverse LQ face reconstructions conditioned on different textual prompts. Specifically, we formulate BFR as a measurement-constrained generative task by constructing an inverse problem through controlled degradations of coarse restorations, which allows posterior-guided sampling within text-to-image diffusion. Measurement constraints include both Forward Measurement, which ensures results align with input structures, and Reverse Measurement, which produces projection spaces, ensuring that the solution can align with various prompts. Experiments show that our MCS can generate prompt-aligned results and outperforms existing BFR methods. Codes will be released after acceptance.

Conclusion: 提出的流式自回归扩散模型成功解决了长音频序列处理问题，实现了高质量、低延迟的实时3D面部动画生成。

Abstract: This paper focuses on the task of speech-driven 3D facial animation, which aims to generate realistic and synchronized facial motions driven by speech inputs.Recent methods have employed audio-conditioned diffusion models for 3D facial animation, achieving impressive results in generating expressive and natural animations.However, these methods process the whole audio sequences in a single pass, which poses two major challenges: they tend to perform poorly when handling audio sequences that exceed the training horizon and will suffer from significant latency when processing long audio inputs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel autoregressive diffusion model that processes input audio in a streaming manner. This design ensures flexibility with varying audio lengths and achieves low latency independent of audio duration. Specifically, we select a limited number of past frames as historical motion context and combine them with the audio input to create a dynamic condition. This condition guides the diffusion process to iteratively generate facial motion frames, enabling real-time synthesis with high-quality results. Additionally, we implemented a real-time interactive demo, highlighting the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. We will release the code at https://zju3dv.github.io/StreamingTalker/.

Conclusion: APS方法通过主动感知策略有效解决了现有方法的局限性，具有模型无关性，可集成到不同预测模型中增强主动感知能力。

Abstract: Forecasting 3D human motion is an important embodiment of fine-grained understanding and cognition of human behavior by artificial agents. Current approaches excessively rely on implicit network modeling of spatiotemporal relationships and motion characteristics, falling into the passive learning trap that results in redundant and monotonous 3D coordinate information acquisition while lacking actively guided explicit learning mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose an Active Perceptual Strategy (APS) for human motion prediction, leveraging quotient space representations to explicitly encode motion properties while introducing auxiliary learning objectives to strengthen spatio-temporal modeling. Specifically, we first design a data perception module that projects poses into the quotient space, decoupling motion geometry from coordinate redundancy. By jointly encoding tangent vectors and Grassmann projections, this module simultaneously achieves geometric dimension reduction, semantic decoupling, and dynamic constraint enforcement for effective motion pose characterization. Furthermore, we introduce a network perception module that actively learns spatio-temporal dependencies through restorative learning. This module deliberately masks specific joints or injects noise to construct auxiliary supervision signals. A dedicated auxiliary learning network is designed to actively adapt and learn from perturbed information. Notably, APS is model agnostic and can be integrated with different prediction models to enhance active perceptual. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the new state-of-the-art, outperforming existing methods by large margins: 16.3% on H3.6M, 13.9% on CMU Mocap, and 10.1% on 3DPW.

Conclusion: WeSTAR框架通过弱监督自训练和正则化，有效提升了单目深度估计基础模型在未见领域的鲁棒性和泛化性能。

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models has substantially advanced zero-shot generalization in monocular depth estimation (MDE), as exemplified by the Depth Anything series. However, given access to some data from downstream tasks, a natural question arises: can the performance of these models be further improved? To this end, we propose WeSTAR, a parameter-efficient framework that performs Weakly supervised Self-Training Adaptation with Regularization, designed to enhance the robustness of MDE foundation models in unseen and diverse domains. We first adopt a dense self-training objective as the primary source of structural self-supervision. To further improve robustness, we introduce semantically-aware hierarchical normalization, which exploits instance-level segmentation maps to perform more stable and multi-scale structural normalization. Beyond dense supervision, we introduce a cost-efficient weak supervision in the form of pairwise ordinal depth annotations to further guide the adaptation process, which enforces informative ordinal constraints to mitigate local topological errors. Finally, a weight regularization loss is employed to anchor the LoRA updates, ensuring training stability and preserving the model's generalizable knowledge. Extensive experiments on both realistic and corrupted out-of-distribution datasets under diverse and challenging scenarios demonstrate that WeSTAR consistently improves generalization and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks.

Abstract: Multi-agents rely on accurate poses to share and align observations, enabling a collaborative perception of the environment. However, traditional GNSS-based localization often fails in GNSS-denied environments, making consistent feature alignment difficult in collaboration. To tackle this challenge, we propose a robust GNSS-free collaborative perception framework based on LiDAR localization. Specifically, we propose a lightweight Pose Generator with Confidence (PGC) to estimate compact pose and confidence representations. To alleviate the effects of localization errors, we further develop the Pose-Aware Spatio-Temporal Alignment Transformer (PASTAT), which performs confidence-aware spatial alignment while capturing essential temporal context. Additionally, we present a new simulation dataset, V2VLoc, which can be adapted for both LiDAR localization and collaborative detection tasks. V2VLoc comprises three subsets: Town1Loc, Town4Loc, and V2VDet. Town1Loc and Town4Loc offer multi-traversal sequences for training in localization tasks, whereas V2VDet is specifically intended for the collaborative detection task. Extensive experiments conducted on the V2VLoc dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance under GNSS-denied conditions. We further conduct extended experiments on the real-world V2V4Real dataset to validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PASTAT.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, powerful image editing methods now enable diverse and highly realistic image manipulations that far surpass traditional deepfake techniques, posing new challenges for manipulation detection. Existing image manipulation detection and localization (IMDL) benchmarks suffer from limited content diversity, narrow generative-model coverage, and insufficient interpretability, which hinders the generalization and explanation capabilities of current manipulation detection methods. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{ManipBench}, a large-scale benchmark for image manipulation detection and localization focusing on AI-edited images. ManipBench contains over 450K manipulated images produced by 25 state-of-the-art image editing models across 12 manipulation categories, among which 100K images are further annotated with bounding boxes, judgment cues, and textual explanations to support interpretable detection. Building upon ManipBench, we propose \textbf{ManipShield}, an all-in-one model based on a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that leverages contrastive LoRA fine-tuning and task-specific decoders to achieve unified image manipulation detection, localization, and explanation. Extensive experiments on ManipBench and several public datasets demonstrate that ManipShield achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong generality to unseen manipulation models. Both ManipBench and ManipShield will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 传统t-SVD方法存在两个关键限制：(1) 潜在张量近似粗糙，无法准确捕获空间局部高频信息；(2) 变换矩阵由固定基原子组成，无法精确捕获模式-3纤维的局部高频信息。

Method: 提出高斯泼溅低秩张量表示(GSLR)框架，使用定制的2D高斯泼溅生成潜在张量，1D高斯泼溅生成变换矩阵，两者在该表示框架中不可或缺且互补。

Result: 在多维图像恢复的广泛实验中，GSLR始终优于最先进方法，特别是在捕获局部高频信息方面表现突出。

Conclusion: GSLR框架能够紧凑且连续地表示多维图像，具有强大的表示能力，尤其擅长处理局部高频信息。

Abstract: Tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) is a promising tool for multi-dimensional image representation, which decomposes a multi-dimensional image into a latent tensor and an accompanying transform matrix. However, two critical limitations of t-SVD methods persist: (1) the approximation of the latent tensor (e.g., tensor factorizations) is coarse and fails to accurately capture spatial local high-frequency information; (2) The transform matrix is composed of fixed basis atoms (e.g., complex exponential atoms in DFT and cosine atoms in DCT) and cannot precisely capture local high-frequency information along the mode-3 fibers. To address these two limitations, we propose a Gaussian Splatting-based Low-rank tensor Representation (GSLR) framework, which compactly and continuously represents multi-dimensional images. Specifically, we leverage tailored 2D Gaussian splatting and 1D Gaussian splatting to generate the latent tensor and transform matrix, respectively. The 2D and 1D Gaussian splatting are indispensable and complementary under this representation framework, which enjoys a powerful representation capability, especially for local high-frequency information. To evaluate the representation ability of the proposed GSLR, we develop an unsupervised GSLR-based multi-dimensional image recovery model. Extensive experiments on multi-dimensional image recovery demonstrate that GSLR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in capturing local high-frequency information.

Conclusion: VLM3D为将VLM丰富的语言基础语义和空间理解注入多样化3D生成管线提供了一条原则性且可泛化的路径。

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation has advanced rapidly, yet state-of-the-art models, encompassing both optimization-based and feed-forward architectures, still face two fundamental limitations. First, they struggle with coarse semantic alignment, often failing to capture fine-grained prompt details. Second, they lack robust 3D spatial understanding, leading to geometric inconsistencies and catastrophic failures in part assembly and spatial relationships. To address these challenges, we propose VLM3D, a general framework that repurposes large vision-language models (VLMs) as powerful, differentiable semantic and spatial critics. Our core contribution is a dual-query critic signal derived from the VLM's Yes or No log-odds, which assesses both semantic fidelity and geometric coherence. We demonstrate the generality of this guidance signal across two distinct paradigms: (1) As a reward objective for optimization-based pipelines, VLM3D significantly outperforms existing methods on standard benchmarks. (2) As a test-time guidance module for feed-forward pipelines, it actively steers the iterative sampling process of SOTA native 3D models to correct severe spatial errors. VLM3D establishes a principled and generalizable path to inject the VLM's rich, language-grounded understanding of both semantics and space into diverse 3D generative pipelines.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CDFSL) endeavors to transfer generalized knowledge from the source domain to target domains using only a minimal amount of training data, which faces a triplet of learning challenges in the meantime, i.e., semantic disjoint, large domain discrepancy, and data scarcity. Different from predominant CDFSL works focused on generalized representations, we make novel attempts to construct Intermediate Domain Proxies (IDP) with source feature embeddings as the codebook and reconstruct the target domain feature with this learned codebook. We then conduct an empirical study to explore the intrinsic attributes from perspectives of visual styles and semantic contents in intermediate domain proxies. Reaping benefits from these attributes of intermediate domains, we develop a fast domain alignment method to use these proxies as learning guidance for target domain feature transformation. With the collaborative learning of intermediate domain reconstruction and target feature transformation, our proposed model is able to surpass the state-of-the-art models by a margin on 8 cross-domain few-shot learning benchmarks.

Abstract: We proposed a generalized method, NeuralSSD, for reconstructing a 3D implicit surface from the widely-available point cloud data. NeuralSSD is a solver-based on the neural Galerkin method, aimed at reconstructing higher-quality and accurate surfaces from input point clouds. Implicit method is preferred due to its ability to accurately represent shapes and its robustness in handling topological changes. However, existing parameterizations of implicit fields lack explicit mechanisms to ensure a tight fit between the surface and input data. To address this, we propose a novel energy equation that balances the reliability of point cloud information. Additionally, we introduce a new convolutional network that learns three-dimensional information to achieve superior optimization results. This approach ensures that the reconstructed surface closely adheres to the raw input points and infers valuable inductive biases from point clouds, resulting in a highly accurate and stable surface reconstruction. NeuralSSD is evaluated on a variety of challenging datasets, including the ShapeNet and Matterport datasets, and achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of both surface reconstruction accuracy and generalizability.

Conclusion: NeuralBoneReg展示了跨解剖结构和模态的强大泛化能力，为计算机辅助骨科手术提供了稳健准确的跨模态对齐解决方案。

Abstract: In computer- and robot-assisted orthopedic surgery (CAOS), patient-specific surgical plans derived from preoperative imaging define target locations and implant trajectories. During surgery, these plans must be accurately transferred, relying on precise cross-registration between preoperative and intraoperative data. However, substantial modality heterogeneity across imaging modalities makes this registration challenging and error-prone. Robust, automatic, and modality-agnostic bone surface registration is therefore clinically important. We propose NeuralBoneReg, a self-supervised, surface-based framework that registers bone surfaces using 3D point clouds as a modality-agnostic representation. NeuralBoneReg includes two modules: an implicit neural unsigned distance field (UDF) that learns the preoperative bone model, and an MLP-based registration module that performs global initialization and local refinement by generating transformation hypotheses to align the intraoperative point cloud with the neural UDF. Unlike SOTA supervised methods, NeuralBoneReg operates in a self-supervised manner, without requiring inter-subject training data. We evaluated NeuralBoneReg against baseline methods on two publicly available multi-modal datasets: a CT-ultrasound dataset of the fibula and tibia (UltraBones100k) and a CT-RGB-D dataset of spinal vertebrae (SpineDepth). The evaluation also includes a newly introduced CT--ultrasound dataset of cadaveric subjects containing femur and pelvis (UltraBones-Hip), which will be made publicly available. NeuralBoneReg matches or surpasses existing methods across all datasets, achieving mean RRE/RTE of 1.68°/1.86 mm on UltraBones100k, 1.88°/1.89 mm on UltraBones-Hip, and 3.79°/2.45 mm on SpineDepth. These results demonstrate strong generalizability across anatomies and modalities, providing robust and accurate cross-modal alignment for CAOS.

Conclusion: SAM-Fed通过利用基础模型指导轻量级客户端，有效解决了联邦半监督学习中伪标签质量和模型容量的平衡问题。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is clinically important, yet data privacy and the cost of expert annotation limit the availability of labeled data. Federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL) offers a solution but faces two challenges: pseudo-label reliability depends on the strength of local models, and client devices often require compact or heterogeneous architectures due to limited computational resources. These constraints reduce the quality and stability of pseudo-labels, while large models, though more accurate, cannot be trained or used for routine inference on client devices. We propose SAM-Fed, a federated semi-supervised framework that leverages a high-capacity segmentation foundation model to guide lightweight clients during training. SAM-Fed combines dual knowledge distillation with an adaptive agreement mechanism to refine pixel-level supervision. Experiments on skin lesion and polyp segmentation across homogeneous and heterogeneous settings show that SAM-Fed consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSSL methods.

Abstract: Multi-source stationary computed tomography (CT) has recently attracted attention for its ability to achieve rapid image reconstruction, making it suitable for time-sensitive clinical and industrial applications. However, practical systems are often constrained by ultra-sparse-view sampling, which significantly degrades reconstruction quality. Traditional methods struggle under ultra-sparse-view settings, where interpolation becomes inaccurate and the resulting reconstructions are unsatisfactory. To address this challenge, this study proposes Diffusion-Refined Neural Attenuation Fields (Diff-NAF), an iterative framework tailored for multi-source stationary CT under ultra-sparse-view conditions. Diff-NAF combines a Neural Attenuation Field representation with a dual-branch conditional diffusion model. The process begins by training an initial NAF using ultra-sparse-view projections. New projections are then generated through an Angle-Prior Guided Projection Synthesis strategy that exploits inter view priors, and are subsequently refined by a Diffusion-driven Reuse Projection Refinement Module. The refined projections are incorporated as pseudo-labels into the training set for the next iteration. Through iterative refinement, Diff-NAF progressively enhances projection completeness and reconstruction fidelity under ultra-sparse-view conditions, ultimately yielding high-quality CT reconstructions. Experimental results on multiple simulated 3D CT volumes and real projection data demonstrate that Diff-NAF achieves the best performance under ultra-sparse-view conditions.

Abstract: Intraoral 3D reconstruction is fundamental to digital orthodontics, yet conventional methods like intraoral scanning are inaccessible for remote tele-orthodontics, which typically relies on sparse smartphone imagery. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) shows promise for novel view synthesis, its application to the standard clinical triad of unposed anterior and bilateral buccal photographs is challenging. The large view baselines, inconsistent illumination, and specular surfaces common in intraoral settings can destabilize simultaneous pose and geometry estimation. Furthermore, sparse-view photometric supervision often induces a frequency bias, leading to over-smoothed reconstructions that lose critical diagnostic details. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{Dental3R}, a pose-free, graph-guided pipeline for robust, high-fidelity reconstruction from sparse intraoral photographs. Our method first constructs a Geometry-Aware Pairing Strategy (GAPS) to intelligently select a compact subgraph of high-value image pairs. The GAPS focuses on correspondence matching, thereby improving the stability of the geometry initialization and reducing memory usage. Building on the recovered poses and point cloud, we train the 3DGS model with a wavelet-regularized objective. By enforcing band-limited fidelity using a discrete wavelet transform, our approach preserves fine enamel boundaries and interproximal edges while suppressing high-frequency artifacts. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset of 950 clinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases. Experimental results demonstrate that Dental3R effectively handles sparse, unposed inputs and achieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion visualization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: With the rise in sedentary behavior, health problems caused by poor sitting posture have drawn increasing attention. Most existing methods, whether using invasive sensors or computer vision, rely on two-stage pipelines, which result in high intrusiveness, intensive computation, and poor real-time performance on embedded edge devices. Inspired by YOLOv11-Pose, a lightweight single-stage network for sitting posture recognition on embedded edge devices termed LSP-YOLO was proposed. By integrating partial convolution(PConv) and Similarity-Aware Activation Module(SimAM), a lightweight module, Light-C3k2, was designed to reduce computational cost while maintaining feature extraction capability. In the recognition head, keypoints were directly mapped to posture classes through pointwise convolution, and intermediate supervision was employed to enable efficient fusion of pose estimation and classification. Furthermore, a dataset containing 5,000 images across six posture categories was constructed for model training and testing. The smallest trained model, LSP-YOLO-n, achieved 94.2% accuracy and 251 Fps on personal computer(PC) with a model size of only 1.9 MB. Meanwhile, real-time and high-accuracy inference under constrained computational resources was demonstrated on the SV830C + GC030A platform. The proposed approach is characterized by high efficiency, lightweight design and deployability, making it suitable for smart classrooms, rehabilitation, and human-computer interaction applications.

Abstract: Scaling up network depth is a fundamental pursuit in neural architecture design, as theory suggests that deeper models offer exponentially greater capability. Benefiting from the residual connections, modern neural networks can scale up to more than one hundred layers and enjoy wide success. However, as networks continue to deepen, current architectures often struggle to realize their theoretical capacity improvements, calling for more advanced designs to further unleash the potential of deeper networks. In this paper, we identify two key barriers that obstruct residual models from scaling deeper: shortcut degradation and limited width. Shortcut degradation hinders deep-layer learning, while the inherent depth-width trade-off imposes limited width. To mitigate these issues, we propose a generalized residual architecture dubbed Step by Step Network (StepsNet) to bridge the gap between theoretical potential and practical performance of deep models. Specifically, we separate features along the channel dimension and let the model learn progressively via stacking blocks with increasing width. The resulting method mitigates the two identified problems and serves as a versatile macro design applicable to various models. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms residual models across diverse tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and language modeling. These results position StepsNet as a superior generalization of the widely adopted residual architecture.

Conclusion: ArchMap证明结合几何归一化与本体引导的多模态推理为现代数字正畸中的3D口腔扫描结构化分析提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: A structured understanding of intraoral 3D scans is essential for digital orthodontics. However, existing deep-learning approaches rely heavily on modality-specific training, large annotated datasets, and controlled scanning conditions, which limit generalization across devices and hinder deployment in real clinical workflows. Moreover, raw intraoral meshes exhibit substantial variation in arch pose, incomplete geometry caused by occlusion or tooth contact, and a lack of texture cues, making unified semantic interpretation highly challenging. To address these limitations, we propose ArchMap, a training-free and knowledge-guided framework for robust structured dental understanding. ArchMap first introduces a geometry-aware arch-flattening module that standardizes raw 3D meshes into spatially aligned, continuity-preserving multi-view projections. We then construct a Dental Knowledge Base (DKB) encoding hierarchical tooth ontology, dentition-stage policies, and clinical semantics to constrain the symbolic reasoning space. We validate ArchMap on 1060 pre-/post-orthodontic cases, demonstrating robust performance in tooth counting, anatomical partitioning, dentition-stage classification, and the identification of clinical conditions such as crowding, missing teeth, prosthetics, and caries. Compared with supervised pipelines and prompted VLM baselines, ArchMap achieves higher accuracy, reduced semantic drift, and superior stability under sparse or artifact-prone conditions. As a fully training-free system, ArchMap demonstrates that combining geometric normalization with ontology-guided multimodal reasoning offers a practical and scalable solution for the structured analysis of 3D intraoral scans in modern digital orthodontics.

TL;DR: DentalSCR是一个用于口腔内扫描模型与侧位头颅X光片3D-2D配准的稳定轮廓引导框架，通过构建统一解剖坐标系和优化轮廓相似性变换，在临床条件下实现可靠对齐。

Motivation: 传统基于强度的配准方法在临床条件下（如投影放大、几何畸变、低对比度牙冠等）不稳定，容易导致配准失败或解剖学上不合理的对齐。

Method: 构建U-Midline牙弓轴线建立统一解剖坐标系，通过表面DRR生成X光样投影，使用对称双向Chamfer距离优化2D相似性变换，采用分层粗到细策略。

Result: 在34个临床病例上评估，显著降低标志点误差（特别是后牙区域），下颌骨误差分布更集中，曲线级别的Chamfer和Hausdorff距离表现优异。

Conclusion: DentalSCR能够稳健处理真实世界头颅X光片，提供高保真度、临床可检查的3D-2D对齐，优于传统基线方法。

Abstract: Reliable 3D-2D alignment between intraoral scan (IOS) models and lateral cephalometric radiographs is critical for orthodontic diagnosis, yet conventional intensity-driven registration methods struggle under real clinical conditions, where cephalograms exhibit projective magnification, geometric distortion, low-contrast dental crowns, and acquisition-dependent variation. These factors hinder the stability of appearance-based similarity metrics and often lead to convergence failures or anatomically implausible alignments. To address these limitations, we propose DentalSCR, a pose-stable, contour-guided framework for accurate and interpretable silhouette-to-contour registration. Our method first constructs a U-Midline Dental Axis (UMDA) to establish a unified cross-arch anatomical coordinate system, thereby stabilizing initialization and standardizing projection geometry across cases. Using this reference frame, we generate radiograph-like projections via a surface-based DRR formulation with coronal-axis perspective and Gaussian splatting, which preserves clinical source-object-detector magnification and emphasizes external silhouettes. Registration is then formulated as a 2D similarity transform optimized with a symmetric bidirectional Chamfer distance under a hierarchical coarse-to-fine schedule, enabling both large capture range and subpixel-level contour agreement. We evaluate DentalSCR on 34 expert-annotated clinical cases. Experimental results demonstrate substantial reductions in landmark error-particularly at posterior teeth-tighter dispersion on the lower jaw, and low Chamfer and controlled Hausdorff distances at the curve level. These findings indicate that DentalSCR robustly handles real-world cephalograms and delivers high-fidelity, clinically inspectable 3D--2D alignment, outperforming conventional baselines.

Abstract: The proliferation of hour-long videos (e.g., lectures, podcasts, documentaries) has intensified demand for efficient content structuring. However, existing approaches are constrained by small-scale training with annotations that are typical short and coarse, restricting generalization to nuanced transitions in long videos. We introduce ARC-Chapter, the first large-scale video chaptering model trained on over million-level long video chapters, featuring bilingual, temporally grounded, and hierarchical chapter annotations. To achieve this goal, we curated a bilingual English-Chinese chapter dataset via a structured pipeline that unifies ASR transcripts, scene texts, visual captions into multi-level annotations, from short title to long summaries. We demonstrate clear performance improvements with data scaling, both in data volume and label intensity. Moreover, we design a new evaluation metric termed GRACE, which incorporates many-to-one segment overlaps and semantic similarity, better reflecting real-world chaptering flexibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARC-Chapter establishes a new state-of-the-art by a significant margin, outperforming the previous best by 14.0% in F1 score and 11.3% in SODA score. Moreover, ARC-Chapter shows excellent transferability, improving the state-of-the-art on downstream tasks like dense video captioning on YouCook2.

Conclusion: 提出的Image-Based Gaussian Splatting方法有效解决了3DGS在捕捉精细细节和视角相关效果方面的局限性，实现了高质量的渲染效果。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a fast, high-quality method for novel view synthesis (NVS). However, its use of low-degree spherical harmonics limits its ability to capture spatially varying color and view-dependent effects such as specular highlights. Existing works augment Gaussians with either a global texture map, which struggles with complex scenes, or per-Gaussian texture maps, which introduces high storage overhead. We propose Image-Based Gaussian Splatting, an efficient alternative that leverages high-resolution source images for fine details and view-specific color modeling. Specifically, we model each pixel color as a combination of a base color from standard 3DGS rendering and a learned residual inferred from neighboring training images. This promotes accurate surface alignment and enables rendering images of high-frequency details and accurate view-dependent effects. Experiments on standard NVS benchmarks show that our method significantly outperforms prior Gaussian Splatting approaches in rendering quality, without increasing the storage footprint.

Conclusion: JFD3框架通过联合特征域去模糊与检测，有效提升了模糊条件下红外无人机目标的检测性能，证明了特征级监督的重要性。

Abstract: Infrared unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) target images often suffer from motion blur degradation caused by rapid sensor movement, significantly reducing contrast between target and background. Generally, detection performance heavily depends on the discriminative feature representation between target and background. Existing methods typically treat deblurring as a preprocessing step focused on visual quality, while neglecting the enhancement of task-relevant features crucial for detection. Improving feature representation for detection under blur conditions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel Joint Feature-Domain Deblurring and Detection end-to-end framework, dubbed JFD3. We design a dual-branch architecture with shared weights, where the clear branch guides the blurred branch to enhance discriminative feature representation. Specifically, we first introduce a lightweight feature restoration network, where features from the clear branch serve as feature-level supervision to guide the blurred branch, thereby enhancing its distinctive capability for detection. We then propose a frequency structure guidance module that refines the structure prior from the restoration network and integrates it into shallow detection layers to enrich target structural information. Finally, a feature consistency self-supervised loss is imposed between the dual-branch detection backbones, driving the blurred branch to approximate the feature representations of the clear one. Wealso construct a benchmark, named IRBlurUAV, containing 30,000 simulated and 4,118 real infrared UAV target images with diverse motion blur. Extensive experiments on IRBlurUAV demonstrate that JFD3 achieves superior detection performance while maintaining real-time efficiency.

Abstract: International standards for biometric identity documents mandate strict compliance with pose requirements, including the square presentation of a subject's shoulders. However, the literature on automated quality assessment offers few quantitative methods for evaluating this specific attribute. This paper proposes a Shoulder Presentation Evaluation (SPE) algorithm to address this gap. The method quantifies shoulder yaw and roll using only the 3D coordinates of two shoulder landmarks provided by common pose estimation frameworks. The algorithm was evaluated on a dataset of 121 portrait images. The resulting SPE scores demonstrated a strong Pearson correlation (r approx. 0.80) with human-assigned labels. An analysis of the metric's filtering performance, using an adapted Error-versus-Discard methodology, confirmed its utility in identifying non-compliant samples. The proposed algorithm is a viable lightweight tool for automated compliance checking in enrolment systems.

Abstract: Though deep neural models adopted to realize the perception of autonomous driving have proven vulnerable to adversarial examples, known attacks often leverage 2D patches and target mostly monocular perception. Therefore, the effectiveness of Physical Adversarial Examples (PAEs) on stereo-based binocular depth estimation remains largely unexplored. To this end, we propose the first texture-enabled physical adversarial attack against stereo matching models in the context of autonomous driving. Our method employs a 3D PAE with global camouflage texture rather than a local 2D patch-based one, ensuring both visual consistency and attack effectiveness across different viewpoints of stereo cameras. To cope with the disparity effect of these cameras, we also propose a new 3D stereo matching rendering module that allows the PAE to be aligned with real-world positions and headings in binocular vision. We further propose a novel merging attack that seamlessly blends the target into the environment through fine-grained PAE optimization. It has significantly enhanced stealth and lethality upon existing hiding attacks that fail to get seamlessly merged into the background. Extensive evaluations show that our PAEs can successfully fool the stereo models into producing erroneous depth information.

However, current LLM-based driving agents lack explicit mechanisms to enforce traffic rules and often struggle to reliably detect small, safety-critical objects such as traffic lights and signs. To address this limitation, we introduce TLS-Assist, a modular redundancy layer that augments LLM-based autonomous driving agents with explicit traffic light and sign recognition. TLS-Assist converts detections into structured natural language messages that are injected into the LLM input, enforcing explicit attention to safety-critical cues. The framework is plug-and-play, model-agnostic, and supports both single-view and multi-view camera setups. We evaluate TLS-Assist in a closed-loop setup on the LangAuto benchmark in CARLA. The results demonstrate relative driving performance improvements of up to 14% over LMDrive and 7% over BEVDriver, while consistently reducing traffic light and sign infractions. We publicly release the code and models on https://github.com/iis-esslingen/TLS-Assist.

TL;DR: BEDLAM2.0是一个新的数据集，用于从视频中推断3D人体运动，特别关注世界坐标系下的运动估计。它在BEDLAM数据集的基础上增加了更多样化和真实的相机运动、人体形状、动作、服装、头发、3D环境以及鞋子等元素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从视频中推断3D人体运动是一个具有挑战性的问题，许多应用需要估计世界坐标系下的人体运动。现有方法在这一领域进展有限，主要原因是缺乏包含真实人体和相机运动的地面真实数据的丰富视频数据。

Method: 开发了BEDLAM2.0数据集，通过增加相机和相机运动的多样性和真实性，提高人体形状、动作、服装、头发和3D环境的多样性和真实感，并添加了BEDLAM中缺失的鞋子元素。

Result: 与在BEDLAM上训练的方法相比，在BEDLAM2.0上训练的最先进方法显著提高了准确性，特别是在估计世界坐标系下的人体运动方面表现更好。

Conclusion: BEDLAM2.0是一个比BEDLAM更好的数据集，特别适用于训练估计世界坐标系下人体运动的方法，为3D人体姿态和运动回归器的训练提供了关键资源。

Abstract: Inferring 3D human motion from video remains a challenging problem with many applications. While traditional methods estimate the human in image coordinates, many applications require human motion to be estimated in world coordinates. This is particularly challenging when there is both human and camera motion. Progress on this topic has been limited by the lack of rich video data with ground truth human and camera movement. We address this with BEDLAM2.0, a new dataset that goes beyond the popular BEDLAM dataset in important ways. In addition to introducing more diverse and realistic cameras and camera motions, BEDLAM2.0 increases diversity and realism of body shape, motions, clothing, hair, and 3D environments. Additionally, it adds shoes, which were missing in BEDLAM. BEDLAM has become a key resource for training 3D human pose and motion regressors today and we show that BEDLAM2.0 is significantly better, particularly for training methods that estimate humans in world coordinates. We compare state-of-the art methods trained on BEDLAM and BEDLAM2.0, and find that BEDLAM2.0 significantly improves accuracy over BEDLAM. For research purposes, we provide the rendered videos, ground truth body parameters, and camera motions. We also provide the 3D assets to which we have rights and links to those from third parties.

Motivation: 现有领域增量学习方法面临两难困境：统一视觉空间会导致领域间干扰和语义扭曲，而隔离领域特定参数会造成知识碎片化，形成阻碍知识重用的"知识孤岛"。

Method: LAVA使用基于文本的参考锚点替代直接特征对齐，通过镜像类名之间的成对语义相似性来定义一致的相对几何结构，指导每个新领域的视觉表示保持这种几何关系。

Result: 在标准领域增量学习基准测试中，LAVA相比最先进方法实现了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: LAVA通过语言锚定的视觉对齐方法，成功解决了领域增量学习中的关键挑战，为跨领域知识迁移和特征聚合提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: A key challenge in Domain Incremental Learning (DIL) is to continually learn under shifting distributions while preserving knowledge from previous domains. Existing methods face a fundamental dilemma. On one hand, projecting all domains into a single unified visual space leads to inter-domain interference and semantic distortion, as large shifts may vary with not only visual appearance but also underlying semantics. On the other hand, isolating domain-specific parameters causes knowledge fragmentation, creating "knowledge islands" that hamper knowledge reuse and exacerbate forgetting. To address this issue, we propose LAVA (Language-Anchored Visual Alignment), a novel DIL framework that replaces direct feature alignment with relative alignment driven by a text-based reference anchor. LAVA guides the visual representations of each incoming domain to preserve a consistent relative geometry, which is defined by mirroring the pairwise semantic similarities between the class names. This anchored geometric structure acts as a bridge across domains, enabling the retrieval of class-aware prior knowledge and facilitating robust feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on standard DIL benchmarks demonstrate that LAVA achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-arts. Code is available at https://github.com/ShuyiGeng/LAVA.

Abstract: In forensic craniofacial identification and in many biomedical applications, craniometric landmarks are important. Traditional methods for locating landmarks are time-consuming and require specialized knowledge and expertise. Current methods utilize superimposition and deep learning-based methods that employ automatic annotation of landmarks. However, these methods are not reliable due to insufficient large-scale validation studies. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework Cranio-ID: First, an automatic annotation of landmarks on 2D skulls (which are X-ray scans of faces) with their respective optical images using our trained YOLO-pose models. Second, cross-modal matching by formulating these landmarks into graph representations and then finding semantic correspondence between graphs of these two modalities using cross-attention and optimal transport framework. Our proposed framework is validated on the S2F and CUHK datasets (CUHK dataset resembles with S2F dataset). Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed framework, which demonstrates significant improvements in both reliability and accuracy, as well as its effectiveness in cross-domain skull-to-face and sketch-to-face matching in forensic science.

Motivation: 探索婴儿阶段性视觉发展（低清晰度、颜色退化、时间连续）在机器视觉中的生态优势，为理解稳健视觉智能的出现提供逆向工程框架。

Method: 提出CATDiet训练方法，在物体中心视频上模拟婴儿视觉约束（灰度到彩色C、模糊到清晰A、时间连续性T），并开发CombDiet方法先用CATDiet初始化再进行标准训练。

Result: CATDiet变体在10个数据集上表现出增强的物体识别鲁棒性，模型展现出与生物发育对齐的模式（如神经可塑性变化类似猕猴V1突触密度、类似婴儿视觉悬崖反应）。CombDiet在物体识别和深度感知任务上优于标准自监督学习。

Conclusion: 婴儿早期视觉体验的发展进程为理解机器中稳健视觉智能的出现提供了有力的逆向工程框架，阶段性视觉输入有助于提升模型的鲁棒性和生物合理性。

Abstract: Newborns perceive the world with low-acuity, color-degraded, and temporally continuous vision, which gradually sharpens as infants develop. To explore the ecological advantages of such staged "visual diets", we train self-supervised learning (SSL) models on object-centric videos under constraints that simulate infant vision: grayscale-to-color (C), blur-to-sharp (A), and preserved temporal continuity (T)-collectively termed CATDiet. For evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark across ten datasets, covering clean and corrupted image recognition, texture-shape cue conflict tests, silhouette recognition, depth-order classification, and the visual cliff paradigm. All CATDiet variants demonstrate enhanced robustness in object recognition, despite being trained solely on object-centric videos. Remarkably, models also exhibit biologically aligned developmental patterns, including neural plasticity changes mirroring synaptic density in macaque V1 and behaviors resembling infants' visual cliff responses. Building on these insights, CombDiet initializes SSL with CATDiet before standard training while preserving temporal continuity. Trained on object-centric or head-mounted infant videos, CombDiet outperforms standard SSL on both in-domain and out-of-domain object recognition and depth perception. Together, these results suggest that the developmental progression of early infant visual experience offers a powerful reverse-engineering framework for understanding the emergence of robust visual intelligence in machines. All code, data, and models will be publicly released.

Motivation: 现有视频理解方法要么依赖昂贵的专有模型，要么需要大量强化学习训练，缺乏证据重访和迭代优化的能力。

Method: 引入三阶段推理过程（检索-感知-回顾）、结构化视频知识库（实体图）和多粒度集成工具，使用开源模型集成替代专有API。

Result: 在LVBench、VideoMME-Long、LongVideoBench和Charades-STA等基准测试中表现出竞争性性能，同时提供更好的可解释性。

Conclusion: AVI框架通过系统级设计实现了无需训练的高效视频理解，在性能和可解释性方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Video understanding requires not only visual recognition but also complex reasoning. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, they typically process videos largely in a single-pass manner with limited support for evidence revisit and iterative refinement. While recently emerging agent-based methods enable long-horizon reasoning, they either depend heavily on expensive proprietary models or require extensive agentic RL training. To overcome these limitations, we propose Agentic Video Intelligence (AVI), a flexible and training-free framework that can mirror human video comprehension through system-level design and optimization. AVI introduces three key innovations: (1) a human-inspired three-phase reasoning process (Retrieve-Perceive-Review) that ensures both sufficient global exploration and focused local analysis, (2) a structured video knowledge base organized through entity graphs, along with multi-granularity integrated tools, constituting the agent's interaction environment, and (3) an open-source model ensemble combining reasoning LLMs with lightweight base CV models and VLM, eliminating dependence on proprietary APIs or RL training. Experiments on LVBench, VideoMME-Long, LongVideoBench, and Charades-STA demonstrate that AVI achieves competitive performance while offering superior interpretability.

Result: 在多个图像数据集上的实验表明，该对话式方法显著优于仅使用初始描述的基线方法，实现了更高的检索精度和更好的交互体验。

Conclusion: DIR-TIR框架通过对话驱动的方法，在交互式文本到图像检索中提供了优越的控制性和容错性，显著提升了检索性能。

Abstract: This paper addresses the task of interactive, conversational text-to-image retrieval.
  Our DIR-TIR framework progressively refines the target image search through two specialized modules: the Dialog Refiner Module and the Image Refiner Module.
  The Dialog Refiner actively queries users to extract essential information and generate increasingly precise descriptions of the target image.
  Complementarily, the Image Refiner identifies perceptual gaps between generated images and user intentions, strategically reducing the visual-semantic discrepancy. By leveraging multi-turn dialogues, DIR-TIR provides superior controllability and fault tolerance compared to conventional single-query methods, significantly improving target image hit accuracy.
  Comprehensive experiments across diverse image datasets demonstrate our dialogue-based approach substantially outperforms initial-description-only baselines, while the synergistic module integration achieves both higher retrieval precision and enhanced interactive experience.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有融合方法采用分阶段策略，难以有效应对低光和运动模糊的联合退化问题，需要更有效的融合方法。

Method: 使用复数神经网络框架，包含复数时间对齐GRU和复数空间-频率学习模块，实现事件数据和RGB帧的时空融合。

Result: 在低光视频去模糊任务中优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: CompEvent通过全流程时空融合和复数神经网络的优势，显著提升了低光视频去模糊能力。

Abstract: Low-light video deblurring poses significant challenges in applications like nighttime surveillance and autonomous driving due to dim lighting and long exposures. While event cameras offer potential solutions with superior low-light sensitivity and high temporal resolution, existing fusion methods typically employ staged strategies, limiting their effectiveness against combined low-light and motion blur degradations. To overcome this, we propose CompEvent, a complex neural network framework enabling holistic full-process fusion of event data and RGB frames for enhanced joint restoration. CompEvent features two core components: 1) Complex Temporal Alignment GRU, which utilizes complex-valued convolutions and processes video and event streams iteratively via GRU to achieve temporal alignment and continuous fusion; and 2) Complex Space-Frequency Learning module, which performs unified complex-valued signal processing in both spatial and frequency domains, facilitating deep fusion through spatial structures and system-level characteristics. By leveraging the holistic representation capability of complex-valued neural networks, CompEvent achieves full-process spatiotemporal fusion, maximizes complementary learning between modalities, and significantly strengthens low-light video deblurring capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CompEvent outperforms SOTA methods in addressing this challenging task. The code is available at https://github.com/YuXie1/CompEvent.

Conclusion: 残差-先验设计与物理约束相结合，产生了空间相干、物理合理的床地形，适用于领域偏移下的操作制图。

Abstract: Accurate subglacial bed topography is essential for ice sheet modeling, yet radar observations are sparse and uneven. We propose a physics-guided residual learning framework that predicts bed thickness residuals over a BedMachine prior and reconstructs bed from the observed surface. A DeepLabV3+ decoder over a standard encoder (e.g.,ResNet-50) is trained with lightweight physics and data terms: multi-scale mass conservation, flow-aligned total variation, Laplacian damping, non-negativity of thickness, a ramped prior-consistency term, and a masked Huber fit to radar picks modulated by a confidence map. To measure real-world generalization, we adopt leakage-safe blockwise hold-outs (vertical/horizontal) with safety buffers and report metrics only on held-out cores. Across two Greenland sub-regions, our approach achieves strong test-core accuracy and high structural fidelity, outperforming U-Net, Attention U-Net, FPN, and a plain CNN. The residual-over-prior design, combined with physics, yields spatially coherent, physically plausible beds suitable for operational mapping under domain shift.

Conclusion: GST框架通过高斯泼溅技术实现了高效的传输计划计算，为计算机视觉任务提供了一种更有效的概率测度传输方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces Gaussian Spatial Transport (GST), a novel framework that leverages Gaussian splatting to facilitate transport from the probability measure in the image coordinate space to the annotation map. We propose a Gaussian splatting-based method to estimate pixel-annotation correspondence, which is then used to compute a transport plan derived from Bayesian probability. To integrate the resulting transport plan into standard network optimization in typical computer vision tasks, we derive a loss function that measures discrepancy after transport. Extensive experiments on representative computer vision tasks, including crowd counting and landmark detection, validate the effectiveness of our approach. Compared to conventional optimal transport schemes, GST eliminates iterative transport plan computation during training, significantly improving efficiency.

Conclusion: SEED-SR通过潜在空间超分辨率方法，成功解决了农业应用中大尺度因子下的农场边界分割问题，为高频农业监测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Delineating farm boundaries through segmentation of satellite images is a fundamental step in many agricultural applications. The task is particularly challenging for smallholder farms, where accurate delineation requires the use of high resolution (HR) imagery which are available only at low revisit frequencies (e.g., annually). To support more frequent (sub-) seasonal monitoring, HR images could be combined as references (ref) with low resolution (LR) images -- having higher revisit frequency (e.g., weekly) -- using reference-based super-resolution (Ref-SR) methods. However, current Ref-SR methods optimize perceptual quality and smooth over crucial features needed for downstream tasks, and are unable to meet the large scale-factor requirements for this task. Further, previous two-step approaches of SR followed by segmentation do not effectively utilize diverse satellite sources as inputs. We address these problems through a new approach, $\textbf{SEED-SR}$, which uses a combination of conditional latent diffusion models and large-scale multi-spectral, multi-source geo-spatial foundation models. Our key innovation is to bypass the explicit SR task in the pixel space and instead perform SR in a segmentation-aware latent space. This unique approach enables us to generate segmentation maps at an unprecedented 20$\times$ scale factor, and rigorous experiments on two large, real datasets demonstrate up to $\textbf{25.5}$ and $\textbf{12.9}$ relative improvement in instance and semantic segmentation metrics respectively over approaches based on state-of-the-art Ref-SR methods.

Conclusion: RSD通过增强BEV特征的风险注意力表示，使模型能够更好地处理空间边界和风险对象，实现更接近人类驾驶的行为。

Abstract: The autonomous driving (AD) system has exhibited remarkable performance in complex driving scenarios. However, generalization is still a key limitation for the current system, which refers to the ability to handle unseen scenarios or unfamiliar sensor configurations.Related works have explored the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to address few-shot or zero-shot tasks. While promising, these methods introduce a new challenge: the emergence of a hybrid AD system, where two distinct systems are used to plan a trajectory, leading to potential inconsistencies. Alternative research directions have explored Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks that generate control actions from VLM directly. However, these end-to-end solutions demonstrate prohibitive computational demands. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Risk Semantic Distillation (RSD), a novel framework that leverages VLMs to enhance the training of End-to-End (E2E) AD backbones. By providing risk attention for key objects, RSD addresses the issue of generalization. Specifically, we introduce RiskHead, a plug-in module that distills causal risk estimates from Vision-Language Models into Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features, yielding interpretable risk-attention maps.This approach allows BEV features to learn richer and more nuanced risk attention representations, which directly enhance the model's ability to handle spatial boundaries and risky objects.By focusing on risk attention, RSD aligns better with human-like driving behavior, which is essential to navigate in complex and dynamic environments. Our experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of RSD in managing complex and unpredictable driving conditions. Due to the enhanced BEV representations enabled by RSD, we observed a significant improvement in both perception and planning capabilities.

Abstract: Understanding the inter-relations and interactions between tasks is crucial for multi-task dense prediction. Existing methods predominantly utilize convolutional layers and attention mechanisms to explore task-level interactions. In this work, we introduce a novel decoder-based framework, Parameter Aware Mamba Model (PAMM), specifically designed for dense prediction in multi-task learning setting. Distinct from approaches that employ Transformers to model holistic task relationships, PAMM leverages the rich, scalable parameters of state space models to enhance task interconnectivity. It features dual state space parameter experts that integrate and set task-specific parameter priors, capturing the intrinsic properties of each task. This approach not only facilitates precise multi-task interactions but also allows for the global integration of task priors through the structured state space sequence model (S4). Furthermore, we employ the Multi-Directional Hilbert Scanning method to construct multi-angle feature sequences, thereby enhancing the sequence model's perceptual capabilities for 2D data. Extensive experiments on the NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/CQC-gogopro/PAMM.

TL;DR: 提出DeCo-VAE，通过解耦视频内容为关键帧、运动和残差三个组件，实现紧凑的潜在表示，避免冗余建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频VAE通常忽略帧间内容的相似性，导致潜在建模冗余。

Method: 将视频内容分解为关键帧、运动和残差三个组件，为每个组件设计专用编码器，使用共享3D解码器保持时空一致性，并采用解耦适应策略进行顺序训练。

Result: 广泛的定量和定性实验表明，DeCo-VAE实现了优越的视频重建性能。

Conclusion: 通过解耦视频内容并分别建模，DeCo-VAE能够实现更紧凑和高效的视频潜在表示。

Abstract: Existing video Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) generally overlook the similarity between frame contents, leading to redundant latent modeling. In this paper, we propose decoupled VAE (DeCo-VAE) to achieve compact latent representation. Instead of encoding RGB pixels directly, we decompose video content into distinct components via explicit decoupling: keyframe, motion and residual, and learn dedicated latent representation for each. To avoid cross-component interference, we design dedicated encoders for each decoupled component and adopt a shared 3D decoder to maintain spatiotemporal consistency during reconstruction. We further utilize a decoupled adaptation strategy that freezes partial encoders while training the others sequentially, ensuring stable training and accurate learning of both static and dynamic features. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that DeCo-VAE achieves superior video reconstruction performance.

Conclusion: D-PerceptCT通过模拟人类视觉系统，有效提升了LDCT图像质量，为放射科医生提供了更具诊断价值的增强图像。

Abstract: Low Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) is widely used as an imaging solution to aid diagnosis and other clinical tasks. However, this comes at the price of a deterioration in image quality due to the low dose of radiation used to reduce the risk of secondary cancer development. While some efficient methods have been proposed to enhance LDCT quality, many overestimate noise and perform excessive smoothing, leading to a loss of critical details. In this paper, we introduce D-PerceptCT, a novel architecture inspired by key principles of the Human Visual System (HVS) to enhance LDCT images. The objective is to guide the model to enhance or preserve perceptually relevant features, thereby providing radiologists with CT images where critical anatomical structures and fine pathological details are perceptu- ally visible. D-PerceptCT consists of two main blocks: 1) a Visual Dual-path Extractor (ViDex), which integrates semantic priors from a pretrained DINOv2 model with local spatial features, allowing the network to incorporate semantic-awareness during enhancement; (2) a Global-Local State-Space block that captures long-range information and multiscale features to preserve the important structures and fine details for diagnosis. In addition, we propose a novel deep perceptual loss, designated as the Deep Perceptual Relevancy Loss Function (DPRLF), which is inspired by human contrast sensitivity, to further emphasize perceptually important features. Extensive experiments on the Mayo2016 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of D-PerceptCT method for LDCT enhancement, showing better preservation of structural and textural information within LDCT images compared to SOTA methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单流CNN无法捕捉跨空间、纹理和频率域的多尺度伪造痕迹，限制了Deepfake检测的鲁棒性和泛化能力

Method: 三模态框架：RGB分支（ConvNeXt-tiny）提取全局视觉不一致性；纹理分支（Swin Transformer-tiny）检测细粒度融合伪影；频率分支（CNN+SE）识别周期性频谱噪声；使用注意力机制进行时序池化和自适应融合

Conclusion: 通过全面的特征融合，该框架对细微伪造具有优越的鲁棒性

Abstract: Deepfakes generated by advanced GANs and autoencoders severely threaten information integrity and societal stability. Single-stream CNNs fail to capture multi-scale forgery artifacts across spatial, texture, and frequency domains, limiting robustness and generalization. We introduce the ForensicFlow, a tri-modal forensic framework that synergistically fuses RGB, texture, and frequency evidence for video Deepfake detection. The RGB branch (ConvNeXt-tiny) extracts global visual inconsistencies; the texture branch (Swin Transformer-tiny) detects fine-grained blending artifacts; the frequency branch (CNN + SE) identifies periodic spectral noise. Attention-based temporal pooling dynamically prioritizes high-evidence frames, while adaptive attention fusion balances branch contributions.Trained on Celeb-DF (v2) with Focal Loss, ForensicFlow achieves AUC 0.9752, F1-Score 0.9408, and accuracy 0.9208, outperforming single-stream baselines. Ablation validates branch synergy; Grad-CAM confirms forensic focus. This comprehensive feature fusion provides superior resilience against subtle forgeries.

Conclusion: 本研究为水下图像恢复和增强提供了可靠且可扩展的数据驱动解决方案，生成的合成数据集公开可用。

Abstract: Underwater image restoration and enhancement are crucial for correcting color distortion and restoring image details, thereby establishing a fundamental basis for subsequent underwater visual tasks. However, current deep learning methodologies in this area are frequently constrained by the scarcity of high-quality paired datasets. Since it is difficult to obtain pristine reference labels in underwater scenes, existing benchmarks often rely on manually selected results from enhancement algorithms, providing debatable reference images that lack globally consistent color and authentic supervision. This limits the model's capabilities in color restoration, image enhancement, and generalization. To overcome this limitation, we propose using in-air natural images as unambiguous reference targets and translating them into underwater-degraded versions, thereby constructing synthetic datasets that provide authentic supervision signals for model learning. Specifically, we establish a generative data framework based on unpaired image-to-image translation, producing a large-scale dataset that covers 6 representative underwater degradation types. The framework constructs synthetic datasets with precise ground-truth labels, which facilitate the learning of an accurate mapping from degraded underwater images to their pristine scene appearances. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments across 6 representative network architectures and 3 independent test sets show that models trained on our synthetic data achieve comparable or superior color restoration and generalization performance to those trained on existing benchmarks. This research provides a reliable and scalable data-driven solution for underwater image restoration and enhancement. The generated dataset is publicly available at: https://github.com/yftian2025/SynUIEDatasets.git.

Motivation: 传统的神经SDF在表示单个形状或场景时表现良好，但在分析多个SDF时存在困难，因为隐空间编码信息有限且会丢失几何细节。

Method: 结合泛化学习和过拟合学习策略，提出新的采样策略来提高训练效率并消除其他SDF影响造成的伪影。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中进行了数值和视觉评估，验证了设计有效性，在表示能力和紧凑性方面优于最新方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够用更紧凑的隐式表示恢复更多高保真几何细节，为多SDF分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Neural signed distance functions (SDFs) have been a vital representation to represent 3D shapes or scenes with neural networks. An SDF is an implicit function that can query signed distances at specific coordinates for recovering a 3D surface. Although implicit functions work well on a single shape or scene, they pose obstacles when analyzing multiple SDFs with high-fidelity geometry details, due to the limited information encoded in the latent space for SDFs and the loss of geometry details. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce a method to represent multiple SDFs in a common space, aiming to recover more high-fidelity geometry details with more compact latent representations. Our key idea is to take full advantage of the benefits of generalization-based and overfitting-based learning strategies, which manage to preserve high-fidelity geometry details with compact latent codes. Based on this framework, we also introduce a novel sampling strategy to sample training queries. The sampling can improve the training efficiency and eliminate artifacts caused by the influence of other SDFs. We report numerical and visual evaluations on widely used benchmarks to validate our designs and show advantages over the latest methods in terms of the representative ability and compactness.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效建模无先验条件下的手-物体交互场景，在复杂动态交互中实现高质量的几何和外观重建，为动态场景建模提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper focuses on a challenging setting of simultaneously modeling geometry and appearance of hand-object interaction scenes without any object priors. We follow the trend of dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting based methods, and address several significant challenges. To model complex hand-object interaction with mutual occlusion and edge blur, we present interaction-aware hand-object Gaussians with newly introduced optimizable parameters aiming to adopt piecewise linear hypothesis for clearer structural representation. Moreover, considering the complementarity and tightness of hand shape and object shape during interaction dynamics, we incorporate hand information into object deformation field, constructing interaction-aware dynamic fields to model flexible motions. To further address difficulties in the optimization process, we propose a progressive strategy that handles dynamic regions and static background step by step. Correspondingly, explicit regularizations are designed to stabilize the hand-object representations for smooth motion transition, physical interaction reality, and coherent lighting. Experiments show that our approach surpasses existing dynamic 3D-GS-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing dynamic hand-object interaction.

TL;DR: 提出了一个深度学习框架，用于白质高信号(WMH)的稳健分割和定位，并证明区域WMH体积在疾病分类中优于全局病变负担，结合脑萎缩指标可进一步提高诊断性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然WMH自动分割方法已有进展，但大多只提供全局病变负荷，忽略了在不同白质区域的空间分布，而区域分布对认知衰老和阿尔茨海默病具有重要诊断价值。

Method: 使用深度学习框架进行WMH分割和定位，在公共数据集和独立ADNI队列中评估，量化解剖定义区域内的WMH负荷，并结合脑结构体积评估诊断价值。

Result: 预测的病变负荷与参考WMH估计一致，区域WMH体积在疾病分类中始终优于全局病变负担，结合脑萎缩指标后AUC值可达0.97，前部白质束等特定区域与诊断状态可重复相关。

Conclusion: 区域WMH量化具有附加价值，将局部病变指标与萎缩标志物结合可能增强神经退行性疾病的早期诊断和分层能力。

Abstract: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are key imaging markers in cognitive aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and related dementias. Although automated methods for WMH segmentation have advanced, most provide only global lesion load and overlook their spatial distribution across distinct white matter regions. We propose a deep learning framework for robust WMH segmentation and localization, evaluated across public datasets and an independent Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Our results show that the predicted lesion loads are in line with the reference WMH estimates, confirming the robustness to variations in lesion load, acquisition, and demographics. Beyond accurate segmentation, we quantify WMH load within anatomically defined regions and combine these measures with brain structure volumes to assess diagnostic value. Regional WMH volumes consistently outperform global lesion burden for disease classification, and integration with brain atrophy metrics further improves performance, reaching area under the curve (AUC) values up to 0.97. Several spatially distinct regions, particularly within anterior white matter tracts, are reproducibly associated with diagnostic status, indicating localized vulnerability in AD. These results highlight the added value of regional WMH quantification. Incorporating localized lesion metrics alongside atrophy markers may enhance early diagnosis and stratification in neurodegenerative disorders.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地震传感器在边境监控中具有隐蔽性优势，但难以准确检测和区分同时发生的人类入侵、动物移动和车辆行驶等重叠活动，这会影响监控系统的可靠性。

Conclusion: HyMAD提供了一个模块化框架，可扩展地震活动识别在实际安全应用中的能力，为边境监控等场景提供可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Seismic sensing has emerged as a promising solution for border surveillance and monitoring; the seismic sensors that are often buried underground are small and cannot be noticed easily, making them difficult for intruders to detect, avoid, or vandalize. This significantly enhances their effectiveness compared to highly visible cameras or fences. However, accurately detecting and distinguishing between overlapping activities that are happening simultaneously, such as human intrusions, animal movements, and vehicle rumbling, remains a major challenge due to the complex and noisy nature of seismic signals. Correctly identifying simultaneous activities is critical because failing to separate them can lead to misclassification, missed detections, and an incomplete understanding of the situation, thereby reducing the reliability of surveillance systems. To tackle this problem, we propose HyMAD (Hybrid Multi-Activity Detection), a deep neural architecture based on spatio-temporal feature fusion. The framework integrates spectral features extracted with SincNet and temporal dependencies modeled by a recurrent neural network (RNN). In addition, HyMAD employs self-attention layers to strengthen intra-modal representations and a cross-modal fusion module to achieve robust multi-label classification of seismic events. e evaluate our approach on a dataset constructed from real-world field recordings collected in the context of border surveillance and monitoring, demonstrating its ability to generalize to complex, simultaneous activity scenarios involving humans, animals, and vehicles. Our method achieves competitive performance and offers a modular framework for extending seismic-based activity recognition in real-world security applications.

Abstract: We present a clustering-based explainability technique for digital pathology models based on convolutional neural networks. Unlike commonly used methods based on saliency maps, such as occlusion, GradCAM, or relevance propagation, which highlight regions that contribute the most to the prediction for a single slide, our method shows the global behaviour of the model under consideration, while also providing more fine-grained information. The result clusters can be visualised not only to understand the model, but also to increase confidence in its operation, leading to faster adoption in clinical practice. We also evaluate the performance of our technique on an existing model for detecting prostate cancer, demonstrating its usefulness.

Abstract: The accurate segmentation of brain tumors from multi-modal MRI is critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. While integrating complementary information from various MRI sequences is a common practice, the frequent absence of one or more modalities in real-world clinical settings poses a significant challenge, severely compromising the performance and generalizability of deep learning-based segmentation models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Cross-Modal Compositional Self-Distillation (CCSD) framework that can flexibly handle arbitrary combinations of input modalities. CCSD adopts a shared-specific encoder-decoder architecture and incorporates two self-distillation strategies: (i) a hierarchical modality self-distillation mechanism that transfers knowledge across modality hierarchies to reduce semantic discrepancies, and (ii) a progressive modality combination distillation approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities by simulating gradual modality dropout during training. Extensive experiments on public brain tumor segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that CCSD achieves state-of-the-art performance across various missing-modality scenarios, with strong generalization and stability.

Motivation: ARC旨在促进抽象推理研究，但现有方法多从语言角度处理，而ARC任务本质上是视觉性的，因此需要从视觉中心的角度重新思考这个问题。

Method: 将ARC问题构建为图像到图像转换问题，在"画布"上表示输入以融入视觉先验，使用标准视觉架构（如ViT）进行图像映射，通过测试时训练实现泛化。

Result: 在ARC-1基准上达到60.4%的准确率，显著优于其他从头开始训练的方法，与领先的LLM性能相当，接近人类平均表现水平。

Conclusion: 视觉范式是解决ARC抽象推理任务的有效方法，证明了视觉架构在抽象推理任务中的潜力，缩小了与人类表现的差距。

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) is designed to promote research on abstract reasoning, a fundamental aspect of human intelligence. Common approaches to ARC treat it as a language-oriented problem, addressed by large language models (LLMs) or recurrent reasoning models. However, although the puzzle-like tasks in ARC are inherently visual, existing research has rarely approached the problem from a vision-centric perspective. In this work, we formulate ARC within a vision paradigm, framing it as an image-to-image translation problem. To incorporate visual priors, we represent the inputs on a "canvas" that can be processed like natural images. It is then natural for us to apply standard vision architectures, such as a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT), to perform image-to-image mapping. Our model is trained from scratch solely on ARC data and generalizes to unseen tasks through test-time training. Our framework, termed Vision ARC (VARC), achieves 60.4% accuracy on the ARC-1 benchmark, substantially outperforming existing methods that are also trained from scratch. Our results are competitive with those of leading LLMs and close the gap to average human performance.

Motivation: 处理音频视频token序列在多模态大语言模型中造成显著计算瓶颈，现有token压缩方法尚未满足联合压缩多模态token的需求。

Method: 首先识别关键音频token，计算每个时间组的音频保留分数来捕捉信息密度，动态指导视频token剪枝，并使用交错时空方案压缩视频token。

Result: 实现了3.42倍推理加速和1.4倍内存减少，同时保持性能且无需训练。

Conclusion: OmniZip有效解决了多模态token压缩问题，显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Omnimodal large language models (OmniLLMs) have attracted increasing research attention of late towards unified audio-video understanding, wherein processing audio-video token sequences creates a significant computational bottleneck, however. Existing token compression methods have yet to accommodate this emerging need of jointly compressing multimodal tokens. To bridge this gap, we present OmniZip, a training-free, audio-guided audio-visual token-compression framework that optimizes multimodal token representation and accelerates inference. Specifically, OmniZip first identifies salient audio tokens, then computes an audio retention score for each time group to capture information density, thereby dynamically guiding video token pruning and preserving cues from audio anchors enhanced by cross-modal similarity. For each time window, OmniZip compresses the video tokens using an interleaved spatio-temporal scheme. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the merits of OmniZip - it achieves 3.42X inference speedup and 1.4X memory reduction over other top-performing counterparts, while maintaining performance with no training.

Motivation: 准确建模阿尔茨海默病的认知衰退对于早期分层和个性化管理至关重要。虽然表格预测因子提供了稳健的全局风险标记，但它们捕捉细微大脑变化的能力有限。

Conclusion: 临床特征在识别高风险极端病例方面表现优异，而基于Transformer的MRI嵌入对稳定性细微标记更敏感，这推动了AD进展建模的多模态融合策略。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease is essential for early stratification and personalized management. While tabular predictors provide robust markers of global risk, their ability to capture subtle brain changes remains limited. In this study, we evaluate the predictive contributions of tabular and imaging-based representations, with a focus on transformer-derived Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) embeddings. We introduce a trajectory-aware labeling strategy based on Dynamic Time Warping clustering to capture heterogeneous patterns of cognitive change, and train a 3D Vision Transformer (ViT) via unsupervised reconstruction on harmonized and augmented MRI data to obtain anatomy-preserving embeddings without progression labels. The pretrained encoder embeddings are subsequently assessed using both traditional machine learning classifiers and deep learning heads, and compared against tabular representations and convolutional network baselines. Results highlight complementary strengths across modalities. Clinical and volumetric features achieved the highest AUCs of around 0.70 for predicting mild and severe progression, underscoring their utility in capturing global decline trajectories. In contrast, MRI embeddings from the ViT model were most effective in distinguishing cognitively stable individuals with an AUC of 0.71. However, all approaches struggled in the heterogeneous moderate group. These findings indicate that clinical features excel in identifying high-risk extremes, whereas transformer-based MRI embeddings are more sensitive to subtle markers of stability, motivating multimodal fusion strategies for AD progression modeling.

Abstract: Poor bone health is a significant public health concern, and low bone mineral density (BMD) leads to an increased fracture risk, a key feature of osteoporosis. We present XAttn-BMD (Cross-Attention BMD), a multimodal deep learning framework that predicts femoral neck BMD from hip X-ray images and structured clinical metadata. It utilizes a novel bidirectional cross-attention mechanism to dynamically integrate image and metadata features for cross-modal mutual reinforcement. A Weighted Smooth L1 loss is tailored to address BMD imbalance and prioritize clinically significant cases. Extensive experiments on the data from the Hertfordshire Cohort Study show that our model outperforms the baseline models in regression generalization and robustness. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of both cross-attention fusion and the customized loss function. Experimental results show that the integration of multimodal data via cross-attention outperforms naive feature concatenation without cross-attention, reducing MSE by 16.7%, MAE by 6.03%, and increasing the R2 score by 16.4%, highlighting the effectiveness of the approach for femoral neck BMD estimation. Furthermore, screening performance was evaluated using binary classification at clinically relevant femoral neck BMD thresholds, demonstrating the model's potential in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: A scalable and robust 3D tissue transcriptomics profile can enable a holistic understanding of tissue organization and provide deeper insights into human biology and disease. Most predictive algorithms that infer ST directly from histology treat each section independently and ignore 3D structure, while existing 3D-aware approaches are not generative and do not scale well. We present Holographic Tissue Expression Inpainting and Analysis (HoloTea), a 3D-aware flow-matching framework that imputes spot-level gene expression from H&E while explicitly using information from adjacent sections. Our key idea is to retrieve morphologically corresponding spots on neighboring slides in a shared feature space and fuse this cross section context into a lightweight ControlNet, allowing conditioning to follow anatomical continuity. To better capture the count nature of the data, we introduce a 3D-consistent prior for flow matching that combines a learned zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) prior with a spatial-empirical prior constructed from neighboring sections. A global attention block introduces 3D H&E scaling linearly with the number of spots in the slide, enabling training and inference on large 3D ST datasets. Across three spatial transcriptomics datasets spanning different tissue types and resolutions, HoloTea consistently improves 3D expression accuracy and generalization compared to 2D and 3D baselines. We envision HoloTea advancing the creation of accurate 3D virtual tissues, ultimately accelerating biomarker discovery and deepening our understanding of disease.

TL;DR: 提出了BioST-GCN模型，结合姿态和生物力学信息进行跌倒预测，在模拟数据上表现良好但存在模拟-现实差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跌倒对老年人造成严重伤害，基于视觉的跌倒预测系统需要解决数据稀缺问题，并提高预测准确性。

Method: 使用双流Biomechanical Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (BioST-GCN)，结合姿态和生物力学信息，采用交叉注意力融合机制。

Result: 在模拟数据上比基线ST-GCN提高5.32%和2.91% F1分数，但对未见受试者的零样本泛化性能降至35.9%，存在明显的模拟-现实差距。

Conclusion: 需要弥合模拟与现实数据之间的差距，通过个性化策略和隐私保护数据管道来开发有效的老年人跌倒预测系统。

Abstract: Falls are a leading cause of injury and loss of independence among older adults. Vision-based fall prediction systems offer a non-invasive solution to anticipate falls seconds before impact, but their development is hindered by the scarcity of available fall data. Contributing to these efforts, this study proposes the Biomechanical Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (BioST-GCN), a dual-stream model that combines both pose and biomechanical information using a cross-attention fusion mechanism. Our model outperforms the vanilla ST-GCN baseline by 5.32% and 2.91% F1-score on the simulated MCF-UA stunt-actor and MUVIM datasets, respectively. The spatio-temporal attention mechanisms in the ST-GCN stream also provide interpretability by identifying critical joints and temporal phases. However, a critical simulation-reality gap persists. While our model achieves an 89.0% F1-score with full supervision on simulated data, zero-shot generalization to unseen subjects drops to 35.9%. This performance decline is likely due to biases in simulated data, such as `intent-to-fall' cues. For older adults, particularly those with diabetes or frailty, this gap is exacerbated by their unique kinematic profiles. To address this, we propose personalization strategies and advocate for privacy-preserving data pipelines to enable real-world validation. Our findings underscore the urgent need to bridge the gap between simulated and real-world data to develop effective fall prediction systems for vulnerable elderly populations.

Abstract: Doppler holography is an emerging retinal imaging technique that captures the dynamic behavior of blood flow with high temporal resolution, enabling quantitative assessment of retinal hemodynamics. This requires accurate segmentation of retinal arteries and veins, but traditional segmentation methods focus solely on spatial information and overlook the temporal richness of holographic data. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective approach for artery-vein segmentation in temporal Doppler holograms using standard segmentation architectures. By incorporating features derived from a dedicated pulse analysis pipeline, our method allows conventional U-Nets to exploit temporal dynamics and achieve performance comparable to more complex attention- or iteration-based models. These findings demonstrate that time-resolved preprocessing can unlock the full potential of deep learning for Doppler holography, opening new perspectives for quantitative exploration of retinal hemodynamics.

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解了稀疏监督导致的过拟合问题，在稀疏视图场景下实现了更准确和详细的表面重建，同时保持了高质量的新视图渲染性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in optimizing Gaussian Splatting for scene geometry have enabled efficient reconstruction of detailed surfaces from images. However, when input views are sparse, such optimization is prone to overfitting, leading to suboptimal reconstruction quality. Existing approaches address this challenge by employing flattened Gaussian primitives to better fit surface geometry, combined with depth regularization to alleviate geometric ambiguities under limited viewpoints. Nevertheless, the increased anisotropy inherent in flattened Gaussians exacerbates overfitting in sparse-view scenarios, hindering accurate surface fitting and degrading novel view synthesis performance. In this paper, we propose \net{}, a method that reconstructs more accurate and detailed surfaces while preserving high-quality novel view rendering. Our key insight is to introduce Stereo Geometry-Texture Alignment, which bridges rendering quality and geometry estimation, thereby jointly enhancing both surface reconstruction and view synthesis. In addition, we present a Pseudo-Feature Enhanced Geometry Consistency that enforces multi-view geometric consistency by incorporating both training and unseen views, effectively mitigating overfitting caused by sparse supervision. Extensive experiments on the DTU, BlendedMVS, and Mip-NeRF360 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 计算细胞学面临两个主要挑战：实例级标签不可靠且获取成本高昂；目击率极低。需要开发能够在低监督信号下稳定学习的方法。

Method: 提出SLAM-AGS框架，联合优化弱监督相似性目标（基于slide-negative patches）和自监督对比目标（基于slide-positive patches），使用自适应梯度手术解决任务梯度冲突，防止模型崩溃。将预训练编码器集成到基于注意力的多实例学习聚合器中。

Conclusion: 解决梯度干扰能够实现稳定的预训练和更好的下游任务性能，特别是在低监督信号场景下。

Abstract: Computational cytology faces two major challenges: i) instance-level labels are unreliable and prohibitively costly to obtain, ii) witness rates are extremely low. We propose SLAM-AGS, a Slide-Label-Aware Multitask pretraining framework that jointly optimizes (i) a weakly supervised similarity objective on slide-negative patches and (ii) a self-supervised contrastive objective on slide-positive patches, yielding stronger performance on downstream tasks. To stabilize learning, we apply Adaptive Gradient Surgery to tackle conflicting task gradients and prevent model collapse. We integrate the pretrained encoder into an attention-based Multiple Instance Learning aggregator for bag-level prediction and attention-guided retrieval of the most abnormal instances in a bag. On a publicly available bone-marrow cytology dataset, with simulated witness rates from 10% down to 0.5%, SLAM-AGS improves bag-level F1-Score and Top 400 positive cell retrieval over other pretraining methods, with the largest gains at low witness rates, showing that resolving gradient interference enables stable pretraining and better performance on downstream tasks. To facilitate reproducibility, we share our complete implementation and evaluation framework as open source: https://github.com/Ace95/SLAM-AGS.

TL;DR: 评估图像分辨率对DeepFace和InsightFace年龄估计准确性的影响，发现224x224像素是最佳分辨率，低分辨率和高分辨率都会降低准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 年龄验证中输入的图像分辨率差异很大，需要了解分辨率对年龄估计准确性的具体影响。

Method: 使用IMDB-Clean数据集的1000张图像，在7种不同分辨率下处理，共7000个测试样本，使用MAE、SD和MedAE评估性能。

Result: 两个框架在224x224像素时表现最佳：DeepFace MAE为10.83年，InsightFace MAE为7.46年。低分辨率时MAE显著增加，高分辨率也会降低准确性。InsightFace在所有分辨率下都比DeepFace更快。

Conclusion: 输入图像分辨率对年龄估计准确性有明确且一致的影响，224x224是最佳分辨率选择。

Abstract: Automatic age estimation is widely used for age verification, where input images often vary considerably in resolution. This study evaluates the effect of image resolution on age estimation accuracy using DeepFace and InsightFace. A total of 1000 images from the IMDB-Clean dataset were processed in seven resolutions, resulting in 7000 test samples. Performance was evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Standard Deviation (SD), and Median Absolute Error (MedAE). Based on this study, we conclude that input image resolution has a clear and consistent impact on the accuracy of age estimation in both DeepFace and InsightFace. Both frameworks achieve optimal performance at 224x224 pixels, with an MAE of 10.83 years (DeepFace) and 7.46 years (InsightFace). At low resolutions, MAE increases substantially, while very high resolutions also degrade accuracy. InsightFace is consistently faster than DeepFace across all resolutions.

Motivation: 手动标注气道不切实际，现有基于U-Net的自动方法会产生不连续组件，影响可靠生物标志物提取。

Method: 三阶段框架：1) nnU-Net网络生成初始气道掩码；2) 基于骨架的算法识别潜在不连续性并提出重新连接；3) 1D卷积分类器确定真实解剖分支与虚假/阻塞路径。

Result: 在ATM'22（健康受试者）和AeroPath（严重气道病理）两个数据集上，RepAir在体素级和拓扑指标上均优于现有3D U-Net方法，如Bronchinet和NaviAirway。

Conclusion: RepAir能够生成更完整、解剖学一致的气道树，同时保持高分割精度。

Abstract: Accurate airway segmentation from chest computed tomography (CT) scans is essential for quantitative lung analysis, yet manual annotation is impractical and many automated U-Net-based methods yield disconnected components that hinder reliable biomarker extraction. We present RepAir, a three-stage framework for robust 3D airway segmentation that combines an nnU-Net-based network with anatomically informed topology correction. The segmentation network produces an initial airway mask, after which a skeleton-based algorithm identifies potential discontinuities and proposes reconnections. A 1D convolutional classifier then determines which candidate links correspond to true anatomical branches versus false or obstructed paths. We evaluate RepAir on two distinct datasets: ATM'22, comprising annotated CT scans from predominantly healthy subjects and AeroPath, encompassing annotated scans with severe airway pathology. Across both datasets, RepAir outperforms existing 3D U-Net-based approaches such as Bronchinet and NaviAirway on both voxel-level and topological metrics, and produces more complete and anatomically consistent airway trees while maintaining high segmentation accuracy.

Conclusion: 整合生理和解剖知识使模型能够"超越图像观察"，为稳健且生理基础的心肌瘢痕分割设定了新方向。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of myocardial scar from late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) cardiac MRI is essential for evaluating tissue viability, yet remains challenging due to variable contrast and imaging artifacts. Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals provide complementary physiological information, as conduction abnormalities can help localize or suggest scarred myocardial regions. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal framework that integrates ECG-derived electrophysiological information with anatomical priors from the AHA-17 atlas for physiologically consistent LGE-based scar segmentation. As ECGs and LGE-MRIs are not acquired simultaneously, we introduce a Temporal Aware Feature Fusion (TAFF) mechanism that dynamically weights and fuses features based on their acquisition time difference. Our method was evaluated on a clinical dataset and achieved substantial gains over the state-of-the-art image-only baseline (nnU-Net), increasing the average Dice score for scars from 0.6149 to 0.8463 and achieving high performance in both precision (0.9115) and sensitivity (0.9043). These results show that integrating physiological and anatomical knowledge allows the model to "see beyond the image", setting a new direction for robust and physiologically grounded cardiac scar segmentation.

Conclusion: 该方法是一种简单、通用且强大的合成视频真实感增强方法，能够有效保持原始视频的结构和语义一致性。

Abstract: We propose an approach to enhancing synthetic video realism, which can re-render synthetic videos from a simulator in photorealistic fashion. Our realism enhancement approach is a zero-shot framework that focuses on preserving the multi-level structures from synthetic videos into the enhanced one in both spatial and temporal domains, built upon a diffusion video foundational model without further fine-tuning. Specifically, we incorporate an effective modification to have the generation/denoising process conditioned on estimated structure-aware information from the synthetic video, such as depth maps, semantic maps, and edge maps, by an auxiliary model, rather than extracting the information from a simulator. This guidance ensures that the enhanced videos are consistent with the original synthetic video at both the structural and semantic levels. Our approach is a simple yet general and powerful approach to enhancing synthetic video realism: we show that our approach outperforms existing baselines in structural consistency with the original video while maintaining state-of-the-art photorealism quality in our experiments.

Motivation: 现代基于Transformer的视频生成器中的注意力机制具有二次时间和内存复杂度，使得超高分辨率视频的端到端训练成本过高。

Method: 采用内滑动窗口注意力机制，并设计双路径管道，通过交叉注意力覆盖策略确保局部注意力生成的语义内容能被全感受野分支引导，同时使用交叉注意力缓存策略提高效率。

Conclusion: FreeSwim方法在无需训练的情况下实现了高质量超高分辨率视频生成，解决了传统注意力机制的计算瓶颈问题。

Abstract: The quadratic time and memory complexity of the attention mechanism in modern Transformer based video generators makes end-to-end training for ultra high resolution videos prohibitively expensive. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce a training-free approach that leverages video Diffusion Transformers pretrained at their native scale to synthesize higher resolution videos without any additional training or adaptation. At the core of our method lies an inward sliding window attention mechanism, which originates from a key observation: maintaining each query token's training scale receptive field is crucial for preserving visual fidelity and detail. However, naive local window attention, unfortunately, often leads to repetitive content and exhibits a lack of global coherence in the generated results. To overcome this challenge, we devise a dual-path pipeline that backs up window attention with a novel cross-attention override strategy, enabling the semantic content produced by local attention to be guided by another branch with a full receptive field and, therefore, ensuring holistic consistency. Furthermore, to improve efficiency, we incorporate a cross-attention caching strategy for this branch to avoid the frequent computation of full 3D attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method delivers ultra-high-resolution videos with fine-grained visual details and high efficiency in a training-free paradigm. Meanwhile, it achieves superior performance on VBench, even compared to training-based alternatives, with competitive or improved efficiency.

Motivation: 标准潜在扩散模型的三部分架构计算效率低下、性能次优，且无法与视觉基础模型的单网络架构统一。目标是统一编码器、解码器和扩散网络为单一端到端可训练网络。

Method: 提出扩散自蒸馏(DSD)框架，通过训练目标的修改来稳定潜在空间，首次实现单一网络的稳定端到端训练，同时学习编码、解码和扩散。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256条件生成任务上，仅用42M/118M/205M参数和50训练轮次，FID达到13.44/6.38/4.25，不使用分类器自由引导。

Conclusion: DSD框架成功解决了潜在坍塌问题，实现了潜在扩散模型的单网络统一架构，在计算效率和性能上均有显著提升。

Abstract: Standard Latent Diffusion Models rely on a complex, three-part architecture consisting of a separate encoder, decoder, and diffusion network, which are trained in multiple stages. This modular design is computationally inefficient, leads to suboptimal performance, and prevents the unification of diffusion with the single-network architectures common in vision foundation models. Our goal is to unify these three components into a single, end-to-end trainable network. We first demonstrate that a naive joint training approach fails catastrophically due to ``latent collapse'', where the diffusion training objective interferes with the network's ability to learn a good latent representation. We identify the root causes of this instability by drawing a novel analogy between diffusion and self-distillation based unsupervised learning method. Based on this insight, we propose Diffusion as Self-Distillation (DSD), a new framework with key modifications to the training objective that stabilize the latent space. This approach enables, for the first time, the stable end-to-end training of a single network that simultaneously learns to encode, decode, and perform diffusion. DSD achieves outstanding performance on the ImageNet $256\times 256$ conditional generation task: FID=13.44/6.38/4.25 with only 42M/118M/205M parameters and 50 training epochs on ImageNet, without using classifier-free-guidance.

Abstract: Despite the growing availability of 3D urban datasets, extracting insights remains challenging due to computational bottlenecks and the complexity of interacting with data. In fact, the intricate geometry of 3D urban environments results in high degrees of occlusion and requires extensive manual viewpoint adjustments that make large-scale exploration inefficient. To address this, we propose a view-based approach for 3D data exploration, where a vector field encodes views from the environment. To support this approach, we introduce a neural field-based method that constructs an efficient implicit representation of 3D environments. This representation enables both faster direct queries, which consist of the computation of view assessment indices, and inverse queries, which help avoid occlusion and facilitate the search for views that match desired data patterns. Our approach supports key urban analysis tasks such as visibility assessments, solar exposure evaluation, and assessing the visual impact of new developments. We validate our method through quantitative experiments, case studies informed by real-world urban challenges, and feedback from domain experts. Results show its effectiveness in finding desirable viewpoints, analyzing building facade visibility, and evaluating views from outdoor spaces.

Abstract: Engagement recognition in video datasets, unlike traditional image classification tasks, is particularly challenged by subjective labels and noise limiting model performance. To overcome the challenges of subjective and noisy engagement labels, we propose a framework leveraging Vision Large Language Models (VLMs) to refine annotations and guide the training process. Our framework uses a questionnaire to extract behavioral cues and split data into high- and low-reliability subsets. We also introduce a training strategy combining curriculum learning with soft label refinement, gradually incorporating ambiguous samples while adjusting supervision to reflect uncertainty. We demonstrate that classical computer vision models trained on refined high-reliability subsets and enhanced with our curriculum strategy show improvements, highlighting benefits of addressing label subjectivity with VLMs. This method surpasses prior state of the art across engagement benchmarks such as EngageNet (three of six feature settings, maximum improvement of +1.21%), and DREAMS / PAFE with F1 gains of +0.22 / +0.06.

Abstract: We propose Confidence-Guided Token Merging (Co-Me), an acceleration mechanism for visual geometric transformers without retraining or finetuning the base model. Co-Me distilled a light-weight confidence predictor to rank tokens by uncertainty and selectively merge low-confidence ones, effectively reducing computation while maintaining spatial coverage. Compared to similarity-based merging or pruning, the confidence signal in Co-Me reliably indicates regions emphasized by the transformer, enabling substantial acceleration without degrading performance. Co-Me applies seamlessly to various multi-view and streaming visual geometric transformers, achieving speedups that scale with sequence length. When applied to VGGT and MapAnything, Co-Me achieves up to $11.3\times$ and $7.2\times$ speedup, making visual geometric transformers practical for real-time 3D perception and reconstruction.

TL;DR: 评估水印技术在对抗攻击下的鲁棒性，比较改写和回译攻击的效果，分析水印技术对文本质量和写作风格的保持能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减轻大语言模型生成文本的潜在危害，但现有水印技术会影响文本质量且易受对抗攻击，阻碍了水印技术的广泛应用。

Method: 使用改写和回译（英语→其他语言→英语）两种对抗攻击方式评估多种水印技术的鲁棒性，并使用语言指标来评估水印文本在质量和写作风格方面的保持能力。

Result: 水印技术能够保持语义，但偏离了无水印文本的写作风格，且易受对抗攻击，特别是回译攻击。

Conclusion: 当前水印技术在保持文本质量和抵抗对抗攻击方面存在不足，需要改进以促进更广泛的应用。

Abstract: To mitigate the potential harms of Large Language Models (LLMs)generated text, researchers have proposed watermarking, a process of embedding detectable signals within text. With watermarking, we can always accurately detect LLM-generated texts. However, recent findings suggest that these techniques often negatively affect the quality of the generated texts, and adversarial attacks can strip the watermarking signals, causing the texts to possibly evade detection. These findings have created resistance in the wide adoption of watermarking by LLM creators. Finally, to encourage adoption, we evaluate the robustness of several watermarking techniques to adversarial attacks by comparing paraphrasing and back translation (i.e., English $\to$ another language $\to$ English) attacks; and their ability to preserve quality and writing style of the unwatermarked texts by using linguistic metrics to capture quality and writing style of texts. Our results suggest that these watermarking techniques preserve semantics, deviate from the writing style of the unwatermarked texts, and are susceptible to adversarial attacks, especially for the back translation attack.

RT canbe seen as a test-time inference method.

*Govardhan Padmanabhan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种无需训练的QE信息错误修正方法：多候选重翻译和基于QE解释的子串替换，前者在WMT 2025任务中获胜。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然联合训练QE和APE系统能提升性能，但APE系统存在过度修正问题，导致性能下降。研究旨在探索无需训练的简单方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 方法一：QE信息重翻译，从不同LLM生成的多个候选中选择质量最高的翻译。方法二：基于QE解释的子串替换，使用条件启发式最小化编辑次数。

Result: 两种方法分别获得Delta COMET分数0.0201和-0.0108，方法一在子任务排行榜上获胜。

Conclusion: 无需训练的QE信息重翻译方法在机器翻译错误修正任务中表现优于基于解释的子串替换方法，证明了简单方法的有效性。

Abstract: The paper presents two approaches submitted to the WMT 2025 Automated Translation Quality Evaluation Systems Task 3 - Quality Estimation (QE)-informed Segment-level Error Correction. While jointly training QE systems with Automatic Post-Editing (APE) has shown improved performance for both tasks, APE systems are still known to overcorrect the output of Machine Translation (MT), leading to a degradation in performance. We investigate a simple training-free approach - QE-informed Retranslation, and compare it with another within the same training-free paradigm. Our winning approach selects the highest-quality translation from multiple candidates generated by different LLMs. The second approach, more akin to APE, instructs an LLM to replace error substrings as specified in the provided QE explanation(s). A conditional heuristic was employed to minimise the number of edits, with the aim of maximising the Gain-to-Edit ratio. The two proposed approaches achieved a Delta COMET score of 0.0201 and -0.0108, respectively, leading the first approach to achieve the winning position on the subtask leaderboard.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型在长上下文中的"迷失在中间"现象对检索式LLM应用的挑战，特别是在控制变量检索任务中的影响。

Method: 提出GM-Extract基准数据集，使用文档指标和变量提取指标两种评估系统，在7-8B参数模型上进行多文档任务（键值提取和问答）的系统评估。

Result: 发现数据在上下文窗口中的表示方式会显著影响检索性能，虽然未观察到一致的U形曲线，但模型表现存在明显模式，且与困惑度分数相关。缓解方法的有效性具有高度复杂性。

Conclusion: 缓解"迷失在中间"现象的方法在实际应用中效果复杂，某些情况下能改善性能，某些情况下会产生负面影响，需要在具体场景中谨慎应用。

Abstract: The diminishing ability of large language models (LLMs) to effectively utilize long-range context-the "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon-poses a significant challenge in retrieval-based LLM applications. To study the impact of this phenomenon in a real-world application setting, we introduce GM-Extract, a novel benchmark dataset meticulously designed to evaluate LLM performance on retrieval of control variables. To accurately diagnose failure modes, we propose a simple yet elegant evaluation system using two distinct metrics: one for spatial retrieval capability (Document Metric) and the other for semantic retrieval capability (Variable Extraction Metric). We conduct a systematic evaluation of 7-8B parameter models on two multi-document tasks (key-value extraction and question-answering), demonstrating a significant change in retrieval performance simply by altering how the data is represented in the context window. While a distinct U-shaped curve was not consistently observed, our analysis reveals a clear pattern of performance across models, which we further correlate with perplexity scores. Furthermore, we perform a literature survey of mitigation methods, which we categorize into two distinct approaches: black-box and white-box methods. We then apply these techniques to our benchmark, finding that their efficacy is highly nuanced. Our evaluation highlights scenarios where these strategies successfully improve performance, as well as surprising cases where they lead to a negative impact, providing a comprehensive understanding of their utility in a practical context.

Motivation: 解决包含最高级（如'最好'、'最流行'）的搜索查询需要多维度比较候选商品的问题，这类查询需要语言理解和领域知识。

Method: 开发框架将查询分解为属性-值提示，与检索过程并行生成，并将最高级语义理解迁移到轻量级模型中以解决延迟问题。

Result: 搜索性能提升10.9个MAP点，排序性能提升5.9个MRR点，相比基线有显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法为最高级语义在检索系统中的表示和模型间迁移提供了见解，在推进语言理解的同时解决了实际部署的延迟约束。

Abstract: Search queries with superlatives (e.g., best, most popular) require comparing candidates across multiple dimensions, demanding linguistic understanding and domain knowledge. We show that LLMs can uncover latent intent behind these expressions in e-commerce queries through a framework that extracts structured interpretations or hints. Our approach decomposes queries into attribute-value hints generated concurrently with retrieval, enabling efficient integration into the ranking pipeline. Our method improves search performanc eby 10.9 points in MAP and ranking by 5.9 points in MRR over baselines. Since direct LLM-based reranking faces prohibitive latency, we develop an efficient approach transferring superlative interpretations to lightweight models. Our findings provide insights into how superlative semantics can be represented and transferred between models, advancing linguistic interpretation in retrieval systems while addressing practical deployment constraints.

TL;DR: MoRA-RAG是一个基于知识的LLM框架，通过混合检索和代理分块机制，将灾后勘察报告转化为结构化知识，用于多灾害推理，准确率达94.5%，显著减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾后勘察报告包含理解多灾害相互作用的关键证据，但其非结构化叙述使得系统知识转移困难。LLMs在分析这些报告时缺乏领域基础，经常产生不可靠或幻觉输出。

Method: 提出MoRA-RAG框架，集成混合检索机制动态路由跨灾害特定数据库的查询，使用代理分块保持检索时的上下文连贯性，并包含验证循环评估证据充分性、优化查询和在信息不完整时启动针对性搜索。

Result: 在HazardRecQA数据集上，MoRA-RAG达到94.5%准确率，比零样本LLMs高30%，比最先进的RAG系统高10%，在不同LLM架构上均减少幻觉，使开源LLMs达到与专有模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: MoRA-RAG为将灾后文档转化为可操作、可信赖的灾害韧性情报建立了新范式。

Abstract: Post-disaster reconnaissance reports contain critical evidence for understanding multi-hazard interactions, yet their unstructured narratives make systematic knowledge transfer difficult. Large language models (LLMs) offer new potential for analyzing these reports, but often generate unreliable or hallucinated outputs when domain grounding is absent. This study introduces the Mixture-of-Retrieval Agentic RAG (MoRA-RAG), a knowledge-grounded LLM framework that transforms reconnaissance reports into a structured foundation for multi-hazard reasoning. The framework integrates a Mixture-of-Retrieval mechanism that dynamically routes queries across hazard-specific databases while using agentic chunking to preserve contextual coherence during retrieval. It also includes a verification loop that assesses evidence sufficiency, refines queries, and initiates targeted searches when information remains incomplete. We construct HazardRecQA by deriving question-answer pairs from GEER reconnaissance reports, which document 90 global events across seven major hazard types. MoRA-RAG achieves up to 94.5 percent accuracy, outperforming zero-shot LLMs by 30 percent and state-of-the-art RAG systems by 10 percent, while reducing hallucinations across diverse LLM architectures. MoRA-RAG also enables open-weight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to proprietary models. It establishes a new paradigm for transforming post-disaster documentation into actionable, trustworthy intelligence for hazard resilience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOC虚假信息检测方法过于强调内部一致性，忽略了图像-文本对与外部证据之间的外部一致性的重要性。

Method: HiEAG框架将外部一致性检查分解为检索、重排序和重写的综合引擎流程，使用AESP进行证据重排序，AEGP进行证据重写，并通过指令微调实现判断解释。

Result: 在不同基准数据集上的实验结果表明，HiEAG在所有样本的准确率上超越了之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: HiEAG通过分层证据增强生成框架有效提升了多模态OOC虚假信息检测的性能，证明了外部一致性检查的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal out-of-context (OOC) misinformation detection have made remarkable progress in checking the consistencies between different modalities for supporting or refuting image-text pairs. However, existing OOC misinformation detection methods tend to emphasize the role of internal consistency, ignoring the significant of external consistency between image-text pairs and external evidence. In this paper, we propose HiEAG, a novel Hierarchical Evidence-Augmented Generation framework to refine external consistency checking through leveraging the extensive knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our approach decomposes external consistency checking into a comprehensive engine pipeline, which integrates reranking and rewriting, apart from retrieval. Evidence reranking module utilizes Automatic Evidence Selection Prompting (AESP) that acquires the relevant evidence item from the products of evidence retrieval. Subsequently, evidence rewriting module leverages Automatic Evidence Generation Prompting (AEGP) to improve task adaptation on MLLM-based OOC misinformation detectors. Furthermore, our approach enables explanation for judgment, and achieves impressive performance with instruction tuning. Experimental results on different benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed HiEAG surpasses previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in the accuracy over all samples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多标签情感分类数据集（如GoEmotions）存在严重的类别不平衡问题，这影响了模型性能，特别是对于代表性不足的情感类别

Method: 通过整合原始GoEmotions数据、使用RoBERTa-base-GoEmotions模型标注的Sentiment140样本以及GPT-4 mini生成的人工标注文本，构建平衡数据集；开发结合FastText嵌入、卷积层、双向LSTM和注意力机制的多标签分类模型

Result: 实验结果显示，与在非平衡数据上训练的模型相比，在准确率、精确率、召回率、F1分数和AUC方面都有显著提升

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多标签情感分类中的类别不平衡问题，显著提高了模型性能

Abstract: Multi-label sentiment classification plays a vital role in natural language processing by detecting multiple emotions within a single text. However, existing datasets like GoEmotions often suffer from severe class imbalance, which hampers model performance, especially for underrepresented emotions. To address this, we constructed a balanced multi-label sentiment dataset by integrating the original GoEmotions data, emotion-labeled samples from Sentiment140 using a RoBERTa-base-GoEmotions model, and manually annotated texts generated by GPT-4 mini. Our data balancing strategy ensured an even distribution across 28 emotion categories. Based on this dataset, we developed an enhanced multi-label classification model that combines pre-trained FastText embeddings, convolutional layers for local feature extraction, bidirectional LSTM for contextual learning, and an attention mechanism to highlight sentiment-relevant words. A sigmoid-activated output layer enables multi-label prediction, and mixed precision training improves computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC compared to models trained on imbalanced data, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: RVLMs依赖安全对齐防止有害行为，但其暴露的思维链痕迹引入了新的攻击面。研究发现RVLMs的安全对齐很容易被突破。

Method: 通过分段干扰引发有害推理痕迹，将自生成输出作为监督微调数据，采用轮次加权损失设计，实现轻量级、分布一致的微调方法。

Result: 在实验中，Stealth Fine-Tuning仅用499个样本和3小时单A100训练，就比IDEATOR攻击成功率提高38.52%，同时保持通用推理能力。

Conclusion: Stealth Fine-Tuning是一种低成本且高效的方法，能够有效绕过对齐防御机制，在AdvBench和多个通用基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented Vision-Language Models (RVLMs) rely on safety alignment to prevent harmful behavior, yet their exposed chain-of-thought (CoT) traces introduce new attack surfaces. In this work, we find that the safety alignment of RVLMs can be easily break through a novel attack method termed \textbf{Stealth Fine-Tuning}. Our method elicits harmful reasoning traces through \textbf{segment-level interference} and reuses the self-generated outputs as supervised fine-tuning data. Through a \textbf{turn-based weighted} loss design, yielding a lightweight, distribution-consistent finetuning method. In our experiment, with only 499 samples and under 3 hours on a single A100 (QLoRA), Stealth Fine-Tuning outperforms IDEATOR by 38.52\% ASR while preserving general reasoning ability, as the tuned model retains the original representation distribution. Experiments on AdvBench and several general benchmarks demonstrate that Stealth Fine-Tuning is a low-cost and highly effective way to bypass alignment defenses. \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Disclaimer: This paper contains content that may be disturbing or offensive.}}

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床文本自动ICD编码面临极端长尾分布问题，数千个罕见和零样本ICD代码在MIMIC-III等数据集中严重不足，导致宏观F1分数较低。

Method: 构建基于罕见代码的现实多标签代码集，利用真实世界共现模式、ICD描述、同义词、分类法和相似临床笔记生成结构化提示，生成90,000个合成笔记覆盖7,902个ICD代码。

Result: 在原始和扩展数据集上微调PLM-ICD和GKI-ICD模型，实验显示方法适度提高了宏观F1，同时保持强大的微观F1，优于先前SOTA方法。

Conclusion: 虽然相对于计算成本增益可能显得有限，但结果表明精心设计的合成数据可以增强长尾ICD代码预测的公平性。

Abstract: Automatic ICD coding from clinical text is a critical task in medical NLP but remains hindered by the extreme long-tail distribution of diagnostic codes. Thousands of rare and zero-shot ICD codes are severely underrepresented in datasets like MIMIC-III, leading to low macro-F1 scores. In this work, we propose a data-centric framework that generates high-quality synthetic discharge summaries to mitigate this imbalance. Our method constructs realistic multi-label code sets anchored on rare codes by leveraging real-world co-occurrence patterns, ICD descriptions, synonyms, taxonomy, and similar clinical notes. Using these structured prompts, we generate 90,000 synthetic notes covering 7,902 ICD codes, significantly expanding the training distribution. We fine-tune two state-of-the-art transformer-based models, PLM-ICD and GKI-ICD, on both the original and extended datasets. Experiments show that our approach modestly improves macro-F1 while maintaining strong micro-F1, outperforming prior SOTA. While the gain may seem marginal relative to the computational cost, our results demonstrate that carefully crafted synthetic data can enhance equity in long-tail ICD code prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于图的方法仅建模成对依赖关系，需要为不同关系视图构建多个图，这引入了冗余、参数开销和融合过程中的错误传播，限制了在短文本、低资源设置下的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出动态超图框架HyperABSA，通过样本特定的层次聚类诱导方面-意见结构，并引入新颖的加速-回退截止策略来自适应确定层次聚类的粒度级别。

Result: 在三个基准数据集（Lap14、Rest14、MAMS）上的实验显示，与强图基线相比持续改进，当与RoBERTa主干配对时获得显著增益。

Conclusion: 动态超图构建是ABSA的高效、强大替代方案，并具有扩展到其他短文本NLP任务的潜力。

Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) predicts sentiment polarity for specific aspect terms, a task made difficult by conflicting sentiments across aspects and the sparse context of short texts. Prior graph-based approaches model only pairwise dependencies, forcing them to construct multiple graphs for different relational views. These introduce redundancy, parameter overhead, and error propagation during fusion, limiting robustness in short-text, low-resource settings. We present HyperABSA, a dynamic hypergraph framework that induces aspect-opinion structures through sample-specific hierarchical clustering. To construct these hyperedges, we introduce a novel acceleration-fallback cutoff for hierarchical clustering, which adaptively determines the level of granularity. Experiments on three benchmarks (Lap14, Rest14, MAMS) show consistent improvements over strong graph baselines, with substantial gains when paired with RoBERTa backbones. These results position dynamic hypergraph construction as an efficient, powerful alternative for ABSA, with potential extensions to other short-text NLP tasks.

Abstract: In this research, we combine Transformer-based relation extraction with matching of knowledge graphs (KGs) and apply them to answering multiple-choice questions (MCQs) while maintaining the traceability of the output process. KGs are structured representations of factual knowledge consisting of entities and relations. Due to the high construction cost, they had been regarded as static databases with validated links. However, the recent development of Transformer-based relation extraction (RE) methods has enabled us to generate KGs dynamically by giving them natural language texts, and thereby opened the possibility for representing the meaning of the input sentences with the created KGs. Using this effect, we propose a method that answers MCQs in the "fill-in-the-blank" format, taking care of the point that RE methods generate KGs that represent false information if provided with factually incorrect texts. We measure the truthfulness of each question sentence by (i) converting the sentence into a relational graph using an RE method and (ii) verifying it against factually correct KGs under the closed-world assumption. The experimental results demonstrate that our method correctly answers up to around 70% of the questions, while providing traceability of the procedure. We also highlight that the question category has a vast influence on the accuracy.

Abstract: Future superhuman models will surpass the ability of humans and humans will only be able to \textit{weakly} supervise superhuman models. To alleviate the issue of lacking high-quality data for model alignment, some works on weak-to-strong generalization (W2SG) finetune a strong pretrained model with a weak supervisor so that it can generalize beyond weak supervision. However, the invariable use of weak supervision in existing methods exposes issues in robustness, with a proportion of weak labels proving harmful to models. In this paper, we propose a selective W2SG framework to avoid using weak supervision when unnecessary. We train a binary classifier P(IK) to identify questions that a strong model can answer and use its self-generated labels for alignment. We further refine weak labels with a graph smoothing method. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms competitive baselines. Further analyses show that P(IK) can generalize across tasks and difficulties, which indicates selective W2SG can help superalignment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个基于符号语言学知识的幻觉定位框架，通过分析符号触发器（如修饰词、否定、数字等）在模型各层的处理过程，揭示了幻觉本质上是符号语言处理失败而非一般生成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在遇到符号触发器时仍存在幻觉问题，但缺乏对这些符号幻觉起源的清晰理解，需要系统性地处理这些触发器并在模型内部定位幻觉的出现位置。

Method: 提出符号定位框架，利用符号语言学和语义知识有意义地追踪幻觉在所有模型层的发展，重点关注模型如何处理符号触发器，使用HaluEval和TruthfulQA分析五个模型。

Result: 符号知识方法显示这些语言元素的注意力方差在早期层（2-4）爆炸性增长到临界不稳定状态，否定触发灾难性方差水平，表明符号语义处理从一开始就崩溃。尽管模型规模更大，幻觉率仍保持高位（78.3%-83.7%），深层中符号语义触发器的注意力急剧下降。

Conclusion: 幻觉本质上是符号语言处理失败，而非一般生成问题，符号语义知识为理解和定位LLMs中的幻觉机制提供了关键。

Abstract: LLMs still struggle with hallucination, especially when confronted with symbolic triggers like modifiers, negation, numbers, exceptions, and named entities. Yet, we lack a clear understanding of where these symbolic hallucinations originate, making it crucial to systematically handle such triggers and localize the emergence of hallucination inside the model. While prior work explored localization using statistical techniques like LSC and activation variance analysis, these methods treat all tokens equally and overlook the role symbolic linguistic knowledge plays in triggering hallucinations. So far, no approach has investigated how symbolic elements specifically drive hallucination failures across model layers, nor has symbolic linguistic knowledge been used as the foundation for a localization framework. We propose the first symbolic localization framework that leverages symbolic linguistic and semantic knowledge to meaningfully trace the development of hallucinations across all model layers. By focusing on how models process symbolic triggers, we analyze five models using HaluEval and TruthfulQA. Our symbolic knowledge approach reveals that attention variance for these linguistic elements explodes to critical instability in early layers (2-4), with negation triggering catastrophic variance levels, demonstrating that symbolic semantic processing breaks down from the very beginning. Through the lens of symbolic linguistic knowledge, despite larger model sizes, hallucination rates remain consistently high (78.3%-83.7% across Gemma variants), with steep attention drops for symbolic semantic triggers throughout deeper layers. Our findings demonstrate that hallucination is fundamentally a symbolic linguistic processing failure, not a general generation problem, revealing that symbolic semantic knowledge provides the key to understanding and localizing hallucination mechanisms in LLMs.

Abstract: Entity Linking (EL), the task of mapping textual entity mentions to their corresponding entries in knowledge bases, constitutes a fundamental component of natural language understanding. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential for enhancing EL performance. Prior research has leveraged LLMs to improve entity disambiguation and input representation, yielding significant gains in accuracy and robustness. However, these approaches typically apply LLMs to isolated stages of the EL task, failing to fully integrate their capabilities throughout the entire process.
  In this work, we introduce DeepEL, a comprehensive framework that incorporates LLMs into every stage of the entity linking task. Furthermore, we identify that disambiguating entities in isolation is insufficient for optimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel self-validation mechanism that utilizes global contextual information, enabling LLMs to rectify their own predictions and better recognize cohesive relationships among entities within the same sentence.
  Extensive empirical evaluation across ten benchmark datasets demonstrates that DeepEL substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average improvement of 2.6\% in overall F1 score and a remarkable 4% gain on out-of-domain datasets. These results underscore the efficacy of deep LLM integration in advancing the state-of-the-art in entity linking.

*Ahlam Alrehili,Areej Alhothali*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出首个阿拉伯语语法错误校正的多系统方法ArbESC+，通过组合多个模型生成修正建议，使用分类器选择最佳修正，在QALB数据集上取得优于单一模型的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语具有复杂的形态和句法结构，现有方法多使用单一模型，未充分利用多系统组合的潜力。

Method: 使用AraT5、ByT5、mT5、AraBART等多个模型生成修正建议，将其表示为数值特征，通过分类器选择最佳修正，并采用支持技术过滤重叠修正和评估决策可靠性。

Result: 在QALB-14测试数据上F0.5达到82.63%，在QALB-15 L1数据上达到84.64%，在QALB-15 L2数据上达到65.55%，优于单一模型。

Conclusion: 这是首个整合阿拉伯语语言错误校正的尝试，为开发先进的阿拉伯语文本处理工具提供了实用步骤。

Abstract: Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) is an important aspect of natural language processing. Arabic has a complicated morphological and syntactic structure, posing a greater challenge than other languages. Even though modern neural models have improved greatly in recent years, the majority of previous attempts used individual models without taking into account the potential benefits of combining different systems. In this paper, we present one of the first multi-system approaches for correcting grammatical errors in Arabic, the Arab Enhanced Edit Selection System Complication (ArbESC+). Several models are used to collect correction proposals, which are represented as numerical features in the framework. A classifier determines and implements the appropriate corrections based on these features. In order to improve output quality, the framework uses support techniques to filter overlapping corrections and estimate decision reliability. A combination of AraT5, ByT5, mT5, AraBART, AraBART+Morph+GEC, and Text editing systems gave better results than a single model alone, with F0.5 at 82.63% on QALB-14 test data, 84.64% on QALB-15 L1 data, and 65.55% on QALB-15 L2 data. As one of the most significant contributions of this work, it's the first Arab attempt to integrate linguistic error correction. Improving existing models provides a practical step towards developing advanced tools that will benefit users and researchers of Arabic text processing.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个针对音乐领域的大语言模型训练框架，包括构建大规模音乐相关语料库、设计领域优先的数据处理流程、引入参考模型质量控制和创建音乐事实性评估基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用任务上表现良好，但在音乐等专业领域受到限制，主要由于语料规模、纯净度以及数据与训练目标匹配度不足。

Method: 构建40B token的音乐相关语料库，采用轻量级分类器过滤和加权领域内文本，多阶段清洗去重，引入参考模型token级软评分进行质量控制，设计MusicSimpleQA基准评估事实性。

Result: 开发了一个可扩展的数据训练框架和可重用的评估工具，为音乐领域大语言模型的构建提供了系统解决方案。

Conclusion: 该工作通过正确的语料库和训练目标，推进了音乐领域大语言模型的发展，提供了领域LLM构建的完整方法论。

Abstract: Large language models perform strongly on general tasks but remain constrained in specialized settings such as music, particularly in the music-entertainment domain, where corpus scale, purity, and the match between data and training objectives are critical. We address this by constructing a large, music-related natural language corpus (40B tokens) that combines open source and in-house data, and by implementing a domain-first data pipeline: a lightweight classifier filters and weights in-domain text, followed by multi-stage cleaning, de-duplication, and privacy-preserving masking. We further integrate multi-source music text with associated metadata to form a broader, better-structured foundation of domain knowledge. On the training side, we introduce reference-model (RM)-based token-level soft scoring for quality control: a unified loss-ratio criterion is used both for data selection and for dynamic down-weighting during optimization, reducing noise gradients and amplifying task-aligned signals, thereby enabling more effective music-domain continued pretraining and alignment. To assess factuality, we design the MusicSimpleQA benchmark, which adopts short, single-answer prompts with automated agreement scoring. Beyond the benchmark design, we conduct systematic comparisons along the axes of data composition. Overall, this work advances both the right corpus and the right objective, offering a scalable data-training framework and a reusable evaluation tool for building domain LLMs in the music field.

TL;DR: 提出Authentic-Dubber模型，通过检索增强的导演-演员交互学习方案，模拟真实配音工作流程，提升电影配音的情感表现力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电影配音方法模拟简化的直接配音流程，忽视了导演与演员之间的关键互动环节。真实配音工作中导演会指导演员内化情感上下文线索。

Method: 构建多模态参考片段库，使用情感相似性检索增强策略，开发渐进式图基语音生成方法，逐步融入检索到的多模态情感知识。

Result: 在V2C Animation基准数据集上的主客观评估验证了有效性，在情感表现力方面实现了全面改进。

Conclusion: Authentic-Dubber能够忠实复制真实配音工作流程，显著提升配音的情感表现质量。

Abstract: The automatic movie dubbing model generates vivid speech from given scripts, replicating a speaker's timbre from a brief timbre prompt while ensuring lip-sync with the silent video. Existing approaches simulate a simplified workflow where actors dub directly without preparation, overlooking the critical director-actor interaction. In contrast, authentic workflows involve a dynamic collaboration: directors actively engage with actors, guiding them to internalize the context cues, specifically emotion, before performance. To address this issue, we propose a new Retrieve-Augmented Director-Actor Interaction Learning scheme to achieve authentic movie dubbing, termed Authentic-Dubber, which contains three novel mechanisms: (1) We construct a multimodal Reference Footage library to simulate the learning footage provided by directors. Note that we integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve deep comprehension of emotional representations across multimodal signals. (2) To emulate how actors efficiently and comprehensively internalize director-provided footage during dubbing, we propose an Emotion-Similarity-based Retrieval-Augmentation strategy. This strategy retrieves the most relevant multimodal information that aligns with the target silent video. (3) We develop a Progressive Graph-based speech generation approach that incrementally incorporates the retrieved multimodal emotional knowledge, thereby simulating the actor's final dubbing process. The above mechanisms enable the Authentic-Dubber to faithfully replicate the authentic dubbing workflow, achieving comprehensive improvements in emotional expressiveness. Both subjective and objective evaluations on the V2C Animation benchmark dataset validate the effectiveness. The code and demos are available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/Authentic-Dubber.

TL;DR: AfriSpeech-MultiBench是首个针对非洲英语口音的领域特定评估套件，涵盖10+国家、100多种口音和7个应用领域，评估了多种语音识别系统在非洲语境下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语音AI技术快速发展，但目前缺乏针对非洲语言多样性的公开应用特定模型评估，需要为非洲使用场景提供专门的语音技术评估工具。

Method: 构建包含10+国家、100多种非洲英语口音的评估套件，涵盖7个应用领域，使用自发和非自发语音对话数据，对开源和闭源ASR模型、多模态LLM进行基准测试。

Result: 开源ASR在自发语音中表现良好但在嘈杂对话中下降；多模态LLM对口音更鲁棒但处理领域特定命名实体困难；专有模型在清晰语音中准确率高但随国家和领域变化大；非洲英语微调模型在延迟和准确性上具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 通过发布这一全面基准，帮助从业者和研究人员选择适合非洲使用场景的语音技术，促进为服务不足社区开发包容性语音应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in speech-enabled AI, including Google's NotebookLM and OpenAI's speech-to-speech API, are driving widespread interest in voice interfaces globally. Despite this momentum, there exists no publicly available application-specific model evaluation that caters to Africa's linguistic diversity. We present AfriSpeech-MultiBench, the first domain-specific evaluation suite for over 100 African English accents across 10+ countries and seven application domains: Finance, Legal, Medical, General dialogue, Call Center, Named Entities and Hallucination Robustness. We benchmark a diverse range of open, closed, unimodal ASR and multimodal LLM-based speech recognition systems using both spontaneous and non-spontaneous speech conversation drawn from various open African accented English speech datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals systematic variation: open-source ASR models excels in spontaneous speech contexts but degrades on noisy, non-native dialogue; multimodal LLMs are more accent-robust yet struggle with domain-specific named entities; proprietary models deliver high accuracy on clean speech but vary significantly by country and domain. Models fine-tuned on African English achieve competitive accuracy with lower latency, a practical advantage for deployment, hallucinations still remain a big problem for most SOTA models. By releasing this comprehensive benchmark, we empower practitioners and researchers to select voice technologies suited to African use-cases, fostering inclusive voice applications for underserved communities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种熵引导的训练框架来解决推理模型压缩中的熵冲突问题，将推理长度压缩到原始的20%同时保持或提升准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型的思维链输出过长导致计算成本高和部署困难，现有压缩方法忽略了训练过程中的熵冲突现象

Method: 采用熵引导的训练框架，在熵下降时鼓励简洁思维步骤，在熵上升时增强紧凑推理模式下的探索

Result: 在六个数学基准测试上，将推理长度压缩到原始的20%，同时保持或超过基线准确率

Conclusion: 熵引导训练框架有效解决了推理模型压缩中的熵冲突问题，实现了高效压缩同时保持性能

Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks, yet the excessive length of their chain-of-thought outputs remains a major practical bottleneck due to high computation cost and poor deployability. Existing compression methods have achieved partial success but overlook a crucial phenomenon in the training process -- the entropy conflict. During compression training, entropy decreases, leading to shorter reasoning but limited exploration, while accuracy-oriented objectives increase entropy, lengthening reasoning chains. This can cause the model to get stuck in a local dilemma. Our analysis further reveals the origin of the entropy conflict: many high-entropy tokens are logical connectors that receive larger gradients and are encouraged under the performance objective, while the compression objective simultaneously penalizes these potentially redundant connectors. This opposing pressure creates a direct source of entropy conflict. To address these issues, we adopt an entropy-guided training framework. As entropy descends, the model is guided toward efficient reasoning by encouraging concise thought steps; as entropy rises, exploration is reinforced under the compact reasoning mode to improve robustness. Experiments on six mathematical benchmarks show that our method compresses reasoning length to 20% of the original while maintaining or even surpassing baseline accuracy. Code and models will be released publicly.

TL;DR: 本文提出通过预测语言化概率分布来改进LLM置信度估计，该方法能鼓励深度推理，在多种模型和任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解模型响应的可靠性在应用中至关重要。虽然已有研究关注生成语言化置信度，并结合思维链推理提供逻辑透明的估计，但推理策略如何影响置信度估计仍待深入探索。

Method: 提出预测语言化概率分布的方法，要求LLM考虑答案空间中的所有候选答案而非单一猜测，并仔细分配置信度分数以满足分布要求，从而鼓励深度推理。

Result: 该方法在不同模型和任务中均表现出优势，无论答案空间是否已知。即使在强化学习后仍保持优势，分析显示其推理模式符合人类期望。

Conclusion: 预测语言化概率分布能有效促进深度推理以改进置信度估计，具有广泛适用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Knowing the reliability of a model's response is essential in application. With the strong generation capabilities of LLMs, research has focused on generating verbalized confidence. This is further enhanced by combining chain-of-thought reasoning, which provides logical and transparent estimation. However, how reasoning strategies affect the estimated confidence is still under-explored. In this work, we demonstrate that predicting a verbalized probability distribution can effectively encourage in-depth reasoning for confidence estimation. Intuitively, it requires an LLM to consider all candidates within the answer space instead of basing on a single guess, and to carefully assign confidence scores to meet the requirements of a distribution. This method shows an advantage across different models and various tasks, regardless of whether the answer space is known. Its advantage is maintained even after reinforcement learning, and further analysis shows its reasoning patterns are aligned with human expectations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前阿拉伯语和双语LLMs在知识型基准测试中得分很高，但可能只是通过记忆或模式识别获得表面能力，缺乏真正的语言理解能力。需要专门的基准来评估深层语言能力。

Method: 通过150个专家设计的多项选择题，直接评估结构语言理解能力，涵盖五个核心语言类别。评估了35个阿拉伯语和双语LLMs。

Result: 当前模型表现出较强的表面水平能力，但在深层语法和句法推理方面存在困难。许多模型通过记忆或模式识别而非真实理解来获得成功。

Conclusion: AraLingBench揭示了基于知识的基准测试高分与真正语言掌握之间的持续差距，为开发阿拉伯语LLMs提供了诊断框架。

Abstract: We present AraLingBench: a fully human annotated benchmark for evaluating the Arabic linguistic competence of large language models (LLMs). The benchmark spans five core categories: grammar, morphology, spelling, reading comprehension, and syntax, through 150 expert-designed multiple choice questions that directly assess structural language understanding. Evaluating 35 Arabic and bilingual LLMs reveals that current models demonstrate strong surface level proficiency but struggle with deeper grammatical and syntactic reasoning. AraLingBench highlights a persistent gap between high scores on knowledge-based benchmarks and true linguistic mastery, showing that many models succeed through memorization or pattern recognition rather than authentic comprehension. By isolating and measuring fundamental linguistic skills, AraLingBench provides a diagnostic framework for developing Arabic LLMs. The full evaluation code is publicly available on GitHub.

TL;DR: ConInstruct基准测试评估LLMs在用户指令包含冲突约束时的检测和解决能力，发现专有模型检测能力强但很少明确通知用户冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLMs遵循用户指令的能力，但忽略了指令包含冲突约束的常见场景，LLMs在此类条件下的行为尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入ConInstruct基准测试，专门评估LLMs检测和解决用户指令中冲突的能力，并对LLMs的冲突检测性能和解决行为进行分析。

Result: 专有LLMs冲突检测能力强，开源模型中仅DeepSeek-R1表现类似；DeepSeek-R1和Claude-4.5-Sonnet平均F1分数最高，分别为91.5%和87.3%。尽管检测能力强，LLMs很少明确通知用户冲突或请求澄清。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在冲突处理方面存在关键缺陷，冲突检测能力强但缺乏明确通知机制，这是未来设计指令遵循型LLMs需要改进的重要方向。

Abstract: Instruction-following is a critical capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). While existing works primarily focus on assessing how well LLMs adhere to user instructions, they often overlook scenarios where instructions contain conflicting constraints-a common occurrence in complex prompts. The behavior of LLMs under such conditions remains under-explored. To bridge this gap, we introduce ConInstruct, a benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs' ability to detect and resolve conflicts within user instructions. Using this dataset, we evaluate LLMs' conflict detection performance and analyze their conflict resolution behavior. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1) Most proprietary LLMs exhibit strong conflict detection capabilities, whereas among open-source models, only DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates similarly strong performance. DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-4.5-Sonnet achieve the highest average F1-scores at 91.5% and 87.3%, respectively, ranking first and second overall. (2) Despite their strong conflict detection abilities, LLMs rarely explicitly notify users about the conflicts or request clarification when faced with conflicting constraints. These results underscore a critical shortcoming in current LLMs and highlight an important area for future improvement when designing instruction-following LLMs.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了化学领域的tokenization瓶颈问题，提升了LLMs在化学任务中的表现

Abstract: The application of large language models (LLMs) to chemistry is frequently hampered by a "tokenization bottleneck", where tokenizers tuned on general-domain text tend to fragment chemical representations such as SMILES into semantically uninformative sub-tokens. This paper introduces a principled methodology to resolve this bottleneck by unifying the representation of natural language and molecular structures within a single model. Our approach involves targeted vocabulary extension-augmenting a pretrained LLM's vocabulary with chemically salient tokens, followed by continued pretraining on chemistry-domain text to integrate this new knowledge. We provide an empirical demonstration of the effectiveness of this strategy, showing that our methodology leads to superior performance on a range of downstream chemical tasks.

Conclusion: ATLAS将发展成为一个长期、开放、社区驱动的平台，为人工通用智能的进展提供可靠的衡量标准。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to performance saturation on many established benchmarks, questioning their ability to distinguish frontier models. Concurrently, existing high-difficulty benchmarks often suffer from narrow disciplinary focus, oversimplified answer formats, and vulnerability to data contamination, creating a fidelity gap with real-world scientific inquiry. To address these challenges, we introduce ATLAS (AGI-Oriented Testbed for Logical Application in Science), a large-scale, high-difficulty, and cross-disciplinary evaluation suite composed of approximately 800 original problems. Developed by domain experts (PhD-level and above), ATLAS spans seven core scientific fields: mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, earth science, and materials science. Its key features include: (1) High Originality and Contamination Resistance, with all questions newly created or substantially adapted to prevent test data leakage; (2) Cross-Disciplinary Focus, designed to assess models' ability to integrate knowledge and reason across scientific domains; (3) High-Fidelity Answers, prioritizing complex, open-ended answers involving multi-step reasoning and LaTeX-formatted expressions over simple multiple-choice questions; and (4) Rigorous Quality Control, employing a multi-stage process of expert peer review and adversarial testing to ensure question difficulty, scientific value, and correctness. We also propose a robust evaluation paradigm using a panel of LLM judges for automated, nuanced assessment of complex answers. Preliminary results on leading models demonstrate ATLAS's effectiveness in differentiating their advanced scientific reasoning capabilities. We plan to develop ATLAS into a long-term, open, community-driven platform to provide a reliable "ruler" for progress toward Artificial General Intelligence.

Motivation: 现有校准方法忽视了多标记类别标签带来的偏差，特别是标签长度偏差问题，这影响了LLMs在真实应用中的性能和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出标准化上下文校准(NCC)，在完整标签级别进行标准化和校准，可扩展到多项选择题等更广泛任务。

Result: NCC在多个数据集和模型上实现统计显著改进，F1分数最高提升10%，且与上下文学习结合时对少样本示例选择更不敏感。

Conclusion: 缓解完整标签偏差对于提升基于LLM方法的性能和鲁棒性至关重要，特别是在类别标签自然包含多个标记的真实应用中。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful zero- and few-shot learners. However, when predicting over a set of candidate options, LLMs suffer from label biases, and existing calibration methods overlook biases arising from multi-token class labels. We tackle an issue we call label length bias, where labels of different lengths are treated inconsistently, even after standard length normalization. To mitigate it, we propose normalized contextual calibration (NCC), an effective method that normalizes and calibrates predictions at the full-label level. NCC achieves statistically significant improvements over prior approaches across multiple datasets and models, with gains of up to 10% F1. Moreover, NCC extends bias mitigation to broader tasks such as multiple-choice question answering. Our analysis shows that, when combined with in-context learning, NCC is less sensitive to few-shot example selection, requires fewer examples for competitive performance, and produces more reliable confidence estimates. These findings highlight the importance of mitigating full-label biases to improve the performance and robustness of LLM-based methods, particularly in real-world applications where class labels naturally consist of multiple tokens.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注通用安全评估，缺乏对教育场景独特安全需求的关注。教育LLMs容易受到越狱和微调攻击，可能导致有害输出。

Method: 1. 构建EduHarm基准，包含五个教育场景的安全-不安全指令对；2. 提出三阶段防护框架(TSSF)：安全感知注意力重对齐、分层安全判断、防御驱动双路由。

Result: 在八种越狱攻击策略上的实验表明，TSSF有效增强安全性且不过度拒绝良性查询。在三个微调攻击数据集上的评估显示，它能够持续实现稳健防御，同时保持良性微调带来的效用增益。

Conclusion: TSSF框架为教育LLMs提供了同时抵御越狱和微调攻击的有效防护方案，在确保安全性的同时维持了模型的实用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into educational applications. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks, which can compromise safety alignment and lead to harmful outputs. Existing studies mainly focus on general safety evaluations, with limited attention to the unique safety requirements of educational scenarios. To address this gap, we construct EduHarm, a benchmark containing safe-unsafe instruction pairs across five representative educational scenarios, enabling systematic safety evaluation of educational LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage shield framework (TSSF) for educational LLMs that simultaneously mitigates both jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks. First, safety-aware attention realignment redirects attention toward critical unsafe tokens, thereby restoring the harmfulness feature that discriminates between unsafe and safe inputs. Second, layer-wise safety judgment identifies harmfulness features by aggregating safety cues across multiple layers to detect unsafe instructions. Finally, defense-driven dual routing separates safe and unsafe queries, ensuring normal processing for benign inputs and guarded responses for harmful ones. Extensive experiments across eight jailbreak attack strategies demonstrate that TSSF effectively strengthens safety while preventing over-refusal of benign queries. Evaluations on three fine-tuning attack datasets further show that it consistently achieves robust defense against harmful queries while maintaining preserving utility gains from benign fine-tuning.

Motivation: 现有的医疗AI评估框架无法反映真实的临床工作流程和安全约束，需要开发一个更全面的基准测试基础设施来评估前沿模型的实际临床准备度。

Method: 构建包含70多万个任务的云基准测试平台，任务经过多阶段细化和多轮临床医生评审，开放式回答使用LLM作为评判器进行评分，并与人类评分进行校准。

Result: 基础LLM平均得分54.1/100（最佳：Claude Sonnet 4.5，62.5/100），但安全和伦理得分较低（18.4/100）；多模态模型表现更差（平均47.5/100）；基于相同骨干的智能体显著提升端到端性能（平均79.8/100）。

Conclusion: MedBench v4揭示了基础模型在多模态推理和安全方面存在持续差距，但治理感知的智能体编排可以显著提升临床准备度而不牺牲能力，为医院、开发者和政策制定者提供了实用的医疗AI审计参考。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical large language models (LLMs), multimodal models, and agents demand evaluation frameworks that reflect real clinical workflows and safety constraints. We present MedBench v4, a nationwide, cloud-based benchmarking infrastructure comprising over 700,000 expert-curated tasks spanning 24 primary and 91 secondary specialties, with dedicated tracks for LLMs, multimodal models, and agents. Items undergo multi-stage refinement and multi-round review by clinicians from more than 500 institutions, and open-ended responses are scored by an LLM-as-a-judge calibrated to human ratings. We evaluate 15 frontier models. Base LLMs reach a mean overall score of 54.1/100 (best: Claude Sonnet 4.5, 62.5/100), but safety and ethics remain low (18.4/100). Multimodal models perform worse overall (mean 47.5/100; best: GPT-5, 54.9/100), with solid perception yet weaker cross-modal reasoning. Agents built on the same backbones substantially improve end-to-end performance (mean 79.8/100), with Claude Sonnet 4.5-based agents achieving up to 85.3/100 overall and 88.9/100 on safety tasks. MedBench v4 thus reveals persisting gaps in multimodal reasoning and safety for base models, while showing that governance-aware agentic orchestration can markedly enhance benchmarked clinical readiness without sacrificing capability. By aligning tasks with Chinese clinical guidelines and regulatory priorities, the platform offers a practical reference for hospitals, developers, and policymakers auditing medical AI.

Abstract: We present Tell Me, a mental well-being system that leverages advances in large language models to provide accessible, context-aware support for users and researchers. The system integrates three components: (i) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) assistant for personalized, knowledge-grounded dialogue; (ii) a synthetic client-therapist dialogue generator conditioned on client profiles to facilitate research on therapeutic language and data augmentation; and (iii) a Well-being AI crew, implemented with CrewAI, that produces weekly self-care plans and guided meditation audio. The system is designed as a reflective space for emotional processing rather than a substitute for professional therapy. It illustrates how conversational assistants can lower barriers to support, complement existing care, and broaden access to mental health resources. To address the shortage of confidential therapeutic data, we introduce synthetic client-therapist dialogue generation conditioned on client profiles. Finally, the planner demonstrates an innovative agentic workflow for dynamically adaptive, personalized self-care, bridging the limitations of static well-being tools. We describe the architecture, demonstrate its functionalities, and report evaluation of the RAG assistant in curated well-being scenarios using both automatic LLM-based judgments and a human-user study. This work highlights opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration between NLP researchers and mental health professionals to advance responsible innovation in human-AI interaction for well-being.

Conclusion: Agent-R1框架为RL驱动的LLM智能体训练提供了有效的解决方案，有助于推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being explored for building Agents capable of active environmental interaction (e.g., via tool use) to solve complex problems. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is considered a key technology with significant potential for training such Agents; however, the effective application of RL to LLM Agents is still in its nascent stages and faces considerable challenges. Currently, this emerging field lacks in-depth exploration into RL approaches specifically tailored for the LLM Agent context, alongside a scarcity of flexible and easily extensible training frameworks designed for this purpose. To help advance this area, this paper first revisits and clarifies Reinforcement Learning methodologies for LLM Agents by systematically extending the Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to comprehensively define the key components of an LLM Agent. Secondly, we introduce Agent-R1, a modular, flexible, and user-friendly training framework for RL-based LLM Agents, designed for straightforward adaptation across diverse task scenarios and interactive environments. We conducted experiments on Multihop QA benchmark tasks, providing initial validation for the effectiveness of our proposed methods and framework.

Abstract: With Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) becoming more and more prominent in generative AI solutions, there is an emerging need for systematically evaluating their effectiveness. We introduce the LiveRAG benchmark, a publicly available dataset of 895 synthetic questions and answers designed to support systematic evaluation of RAG-based Q&A systems. This synthetic benchmark is derived from the one used during the SIGIR'2025 LiveRAG Challenge, where competitors were evaluated under strict time constraints. It is augmented with information that was not made available to competitors during the Challenge, such as the ground-truth answers, together with their associated supporting claims which were used for evaluating competitors' answers. In addition, each question is associated with estimated difficulty and discriminability scores, derived from applying an Item Response Theory model to competitors' responses. Our analysis highlights the benchmark's questions diversity, the wide range of their difficulty levels, and their usefulness in differentiating between system capabilities. The LiveRAG benchmark will hopefully help the community advance RAG research, conduct systematic evaluation, and develop more robust Q&A systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文档级主张提取在事实核查领域仍面临挑战，现有的评估方法研究有限，需要可靠的方法来比较模型提取和人工标注的主张集合。

Method: 研究了对齐两组主张的技术，通过识别最佳对齐和评估方法来计算相似度得分，作为模型提取性能的评估指标和标注者间一致性的度量。

Result: 在捷克和斯洛伐克新闻评论数据集上的实验表明，现有评估方法在文档级主张提取中存在局限性，无法充分捕捉语义相似性和关键主张属性。

Conclusion: 当前评估方法在文档级主张提取中表现不足，需要更先进的方法来正确评估语义相似性、原子性、可核查性和去语境化等关键主张属性。

Abstract: Document-level claim extraction remains an open challenge in the field of fact-checking, and subsequently, methods for evaluating extracted claims have received limited attention. In this work, we explore approaches to aligning two sets of claims pertaining to the same source document and computing their similarity through an alignment score. We investigate techniques to identify the best possible alignment and evaluation method between claim sets, with the aim of providing a reliable evaluation framework. Our approach enables comparison between model-extracted and human-annotated claim sets, serving as a metric for assessing the extraction performance of models and also as a possible measure of inter-annotator agreement. We conduct experiments on newly collected dataset-claims extracted from comments under Czech and Slovak news articles-domains that pose additional challenges due to the informal language, strong local context, and subtleties of these closely related languages. The results draw attention to the limitations of current evaluation approaches when applied to document-level claim extraction and highlight the need for more advanced methods-ones able to correctly capture semantic similarity and evaluate essential claim properties such as atomicity, checkworthiness, and decontextualization.

In this work, we present a novel method for collecting naturally occurring summaries via Front-Page Teasers, where editors summarize full length articles. We show that this phenomenon is common across seven diverse languages and supports multi-document summarization. To scale data collection, we develop an automatic process, suited to varying linguistic resource levels. Finally, we apply this process to a Hebrew newspaper title, producing HEBTEASESUM, the first dedicated multi-document summarization dataset in Hebrew.

Motivation: 急性肾损伤患者发展为慢性肾病的风险很高，但识别高风险患者仍然具有挑战性，需要开发数据驱动的方法来早期识别和干预

Method: 使用电子健康记录数据，通过纵向医疗代码和肌酐测量值聚类识别AKI后临床状态，使用多状态模型估计状态间转移概率和CKD进展风险

Result: 在20,699名AKI患者中，3,491人发展为CKD；识别出15个不同的AKI后临床状态，每个状态有不同的CKD发展概率；75%患者保持单一状态或仅有一次状态转移

Conclusion: 该研究展示了一种数据驱动方法来识别高风险AKI患者，支持开发用于早期CKD检测和干预的决策支持工具

Abstract: Patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) are at high risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD), but identifying those at greatest risk remains challenging. We used electronic health record (EHR) data to dynamically track AKI patients' clinical evolution and characterize AKI-to-CKD progression. Post-AKI clinical states were identified by clustering patient vectors derived from longitudinal medical codes and creatinine measurements. Transition probabilities between states and progression to CKD were estimated using multi-state modeling. After identifying common post-AKI trajectories, CKD risk factors in AKI subpopulations were identified through survival analysis. Of 20,699 patients with AKI at admission, 3,491 (17%) developed CKD. We identified fifteen distinct post-AKI states, each with different probabilities of CKD development. Most patients (75%, n=15,607) remained in a single state or made only one transition during the study period. Both established (e.g., AKI severity, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, liver disease) and novel CKD risk factors, with their impact varying across these clinical states. This study demonstrates a data-driven approach for identifying high-risk AKI patients, supporting the development of decision-support tools for early CKD detection and intervention.

TL;DR: 本研究比较了人类标注与多种大语言模型在政治偏见检测方面的表现，发现RoBERTa与人类标注最一致，GPT在零样本设置下表现最佳，揭示了人类与LLM在政治偏见感知上的系统性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然NLP技术已能自动分类政治偏见，但大语言模型与人类判断的契合程度仍未被充分探索和理解，需要系统评估人类与模型在偏见检测上的差异。

Method: 构建人工标注的新闻文章数据集，评估标注一致性、偏见极性和模型间一致性，量化人类与模型偏见感知的差异，比较GPT、BERT、RoBERTa和FLAN等多种模型。

Result: 传统transformer模型中RoBERTa与人类标签最一致，生成模型如GPT在零样本设置下与人类标注总体一致度最高，微调后的RoBERTa模型获得最高准确率和最强的人类标注对齐度。

Conclusion: 人类与LLM在政治偏见感知上存在系统性差异，需要结合人类可解释性和模型可扩展性的混合评估框架来进行自动媒体偏见检测。

Abstract: Detecting political bias in news media is a complex task that requires interpreting subtle linguistic and contextual cues. Although recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have enabled automatic bias classification, the extent to which large language models (LLMs) align with human judgment still remains relatively underexplored and not yet well understood. This study aims to present a comparative framework for evaluating the detection of political bias across human annotations and multiple LLMs, including GPT, BERT, RoBERTa, and FLAN. We construct a manually annotated dataset of news articles and assess annotation consistency, bias polarity, and inter-model agreement to quantify divergence between human and model perceptions of bias. Experimental results show that among traditional transformer-based models, RoBERTa achieves the highest alignment with human labels, whereas generative models such as GPT demonstrate the strongest overall agreement with human annotations in a zero-shot setting. Among all transformer-based baselines, our fine-tuned RoBERTa model acquired the highest accuracy and the strongest alignment with human-annotated labels. Our findings highlight systematic differences in how humans and LLMs perceive political slant, underscoring the need for hybrid evaluation frameworks that combine human interpretability with model scalability in automated media bias detection.

Motivation: 现有的自主科学发现系统在处理复杂数据分析时容易产生错误推理路径，且缺乏实时自我纠正能力。需要一种能够验证中间结果并动态调整分析策略的方法。

Method: 将图表作为可验证检查点，使用视觉语言模型作为裁判，根据动态生成的领域特定评分标准评估图表，使智能体能够纠正自身错误并实时引导数据分析。

Result: 在宇宙学和天体化学的案例研究中，系统能够从错误推理路径中恢复并适应新数据集。在10个数据驱动发现任务的基准测试中，VLM增强系统达到0.7-0.8的pass@1分数，远高于代码基线(0.2-0.3)和代码加文本基线(0.4-0.5)。

Conclusion: 基于视觉语言模型的多智能体系统显著提高了自主科学发现的端到端性能，提供了可审计的推理轨迹，增强了系统的可解释性。

Abstract: We show that multi-agent systems guided by vision-language models (VLMs) improve end-to-end autonomous scientific discovery. By treating plots as verifiable checkpoints, a VLM-as-a-judge evaluates figures against dynamically generated domain-specific rubrics, enabling agents to correct their own errors and steer exploratory data analysis in real-time. Case studies in cosmology and astrochemistry demonstrate recovery from faulty reasoning paths and adaptation to new datasets without human intervention. On a 10-task benchmark for data-driven discovery, VLM-augmented systems achieve pass at 1 scores of 0.7-0.8, compared to 0.2-0.3 for code-only and 0.4-0.5 for code-and-text baselines, while also providing auditable reasoning traces that improve interpretability.

Motivation: 罕见病影响全球数亿人，但诊断往往需要数年时间。传统诊断流程存在证据提取与推理分离的问题，通用/医学大语言模型面临真实世界电子健康记录稀缺、领域知识陈旧和幻觉等挑战。

Method: 构建了大规模领域专用临床语料库和临床医生验证的推理集，通过分阶段指令调优、思维链学习和图检索增强开发RareSeek R1系统。

Result: 在多中心电子健康记录叙述和公共基准测试中，RareSeek R1实现了最先进的准确率、稳健的泛化能力和在噪声或重叠表型下的稳定性。检索增强在叙述与优先变异配对时效果最佳，通过解决歧义和将候选疾病与机制对齐。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了以叙述为先、知识整合的推理范式，缩短诊断历程，并提供可审计、临床可转化的决策支持。透明推理突出了支撑许多正确诊断的决定性非表型证据（中位数23.1%，如影像、干预、功能测试）。

Abstract: Rare diseases affect hundreds of millions worldwide, yet diagnosis often spans years. Convectional pipelines decouple noisy evidence extraction from downstream inferential diagnosis, and general/medical large language models (LLMs) face scarce real world electronic health records (EHRs), stale domain knowledge, and hallucinations. We assemble a large, domain specialized clinical corpus and a clinician validated reasoning set, and develop RareSeek R1 via staged instruction tuning, chain of thought learning, and graph grounded retrieval. Across multicenter EHR narratives and public benchmarks, RareSeek R1 attains state of the art accuracy, robust generalization, and stability under noisy or overlapping phenotypes. Augmented retrieval yields the largest gains when narratives pair with prioritized variants by resolving ambiguity and aligning candidates to mechanisms. Human studies show performance on par with experienced physicians and consistent gains in assistive use. Notably, transparent reasoning highlights decisive non phenotypic evidence (median 23.1%, such as imaging, interventions, functional tests) underpinning many correct diagnoses. This work advances a narrative first, knowledge integrated reasoning paradigm that shortens the diagnostic odyssey and enables auditable, clinically translatable decision support.

Conclusion: 研究结果支持噪声信道理论作为语言处理现象的统一计算层面理论，为噪声信道推理在语言理解中的作用提供了新证据。

Abstract: Like visual processing, language processing is susceptible to illusions in which people systematically misperceive stimuli. In one such case--the comparative illusion (CI), e.g., More students have been to Russia than I have--comprehenders tend to judge the sentence as acceptable despite its underlying nonsensical comparison. Prior research has argued that this phenomenon can be explained as Bayesian inference over a noisy channel: the posterior probability of an interpretation of a sentence is proportional to both the prior probability of that interpretation and the likelihood of corruption into the observed (CI) sentence. Initial behavioral work has supported this claim by evaluating a narrow set of alternative interpretations of CI sentences and showing that comprehenders favor interpretations that are more likely to have been corrupted into the illusory sentence. In this study, we replicate and go substantially beyond this earlier work by directly predicting the strength of illusion with a quantitative model of the posterior probability of plausible interpretations, which we derive through a novel synthesis of statistical language models with human behavioral data. Our model explains not only the fine gradations in the strength of CI effects, but also a previously unexplained effect caused by pronominal vs. full noun phrase than-clause subjects. These findings support a noisy-channel theory of sentence comprehension by demonstrating that the theory makes novel predictions about the comparative illusion that bear out empirically. This outcome joins related evidence of noisy channel processing in both illusory and non-illusory contexts to support noisy channel inference as a unified computational-level theory of diverse language processing phenomena.

Motivation: NLP数据集中的标注偏见是开发多语言大语言模型的主要挑战，特别是在文化多样性的环境中。来自任务框架、标注者主观性和文化不匹配的偏见会扭曲模型输出并加剧社会危害。

Method: 提出了一个综合框架来理解标注偏见，包括偏见分类、检测方法（如标注者间一致性、模型分歧和元数据分析）以及缓解策略（如多样化标注者招募、迭代指南改进和事后模型调整）。

Result: 开发了一个标注偏见的类型学，综合了检测指标，提出了适用于多语言环境的基于集成的偏见缓解方法，并对标注过程进行了伦理分析。

Conclusion: 这些见解旨在为LLMs提供更公平和基于文化的标注流程，促进多语言大语言模型的公平发展。

Abstract: Annotation bias in NLP datasets remains a major challenge for developing multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in culturally diverse settings. Bias from task framing, annotator subjectivity, and cultural mismatches can distort model outputs and exacerbate social harms. We propose a comprehensive framework for understanding annotation bias, distinguishing among instruction bias, annotator bias, and contextual and cultural bias. We review detection methods (including inter-annotator agreement, model disagreement, and metadata analysis) and highlight emerging techniques such as multilingual model divergence and cultural inference. We further outline proactive and reactive mitigation strategies, including diverse annotator recruitment, iterative guideline refinement, and post-hoc model adjustments. Our contributions include: (1) a typology of annotation bias; (2) a synthesis of detection metrics; (3) an ensemble-based bias mitigation approach adapted for multilingual settings, and (4) an ethical analysis of annotation processes. Together, these insights aim to inform more equitable and culturally grounded annotation pipelines for LLMs.

Conclusion: 该框架在真实世界低资源条件下表现优异，为加速合同修订工作流程提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Contract management involves reviewing and negotiating provisions, individual clauses that define rights, obligations, and terms of agreement. During this process, revisions to provisions are proposed and iteratively refined, some of which may be problematic or unacceptable. Automating this workflow is challenging due to the scarcity of labeled data and the abundance of unstructured legacy contracts. In this paper, we present a modular framework designed to streamline contract management through a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline. Our system integrates synthetic data generation, semantic clause retrieval, acceptability classification, and reward-based alignment to flag problematic revisions and generate improved alternatives. Developed and evaluated in collaboration with an industry partner, our system achieves over 80% accuracy in both identifying and optimizing problematic revisions, demonstrating strong performance under real-world, low-resource conditions and offering a practical means of accelerating contract revision workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Herda定律认为类型-标记关系符合幂律函数，在log-log尺度下应为直线，但实际观察发现即使在log-log尺度下曲线仍呈凹形，这挑战了幂律关系的有效性。

Method: 使用20部英文小说（部分为翻译作品）的类型-标记数据，在log-log尺度下进行线性回归和二次回归分析，并采用"有放回随机抽彩色球"模型来解释曲率现象。

Result: 回归分析显示线性系数略大于1，二次系数约为-0.02，二次函数能完美拟合数据。曲率等同于"伪方差"且为负值，该形式化方法在小标记数时可粗略估计曲率。

Conclusion: 类型-标记关系在log-log尺度下并非严格直线，而是轻微凹形，二次函数比幂律函数能更好地描述这一关系，曲率可通过伪方差概念进行解释。

Abstract: Heaps' or Herdan's law characterizes the word-type vs. word-token relation by a power-law function, which is concave in linear-linear scale but a straight line in log-log scale. However, it has been observed that even in log-log scale, the type-token curve is still slightly concave, invalidating the power-law relation. At the next-order approximation, we have shown, by twenty English novels or writings (some are translated from another language to English), that quadratic functions in log-log scale fit the type-token data perfectly. Regression analyses of log(type)-log(token) data with both a linear and quadratic term consistently lead to a linear coefficient of slightly larger than 1, and a quadratic coefficient around -0.02. Using the ``random drawing colored ball from the bag with replacement" model, we have shown that the curvature of the log-log scale is identical to a ``pseudo-variance" which is negative. Although a pseudo-variance calculation may encounter numeric instability when the number of tokens is large, due to the large values of pseudo-weights, this formalism provides a rough estimation of the curvature when the number of tokens is small.

Conclusion: SMRC方法在教育适用性方面表现优异，能够有效纠正学生数学推理错误

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often make reasoning errors when solving mathematical problems, and how to automatically detect and correct these errors has become an important research direction. However, existing approaches \textit{mainly focus on self-correction within the model}, which falls short of the ``teacher-style`` correction required in educational settings, \textit{i.e.}, systematically guiding and revising a student's problem-solving process. To address this gap, we propose \texttt{SMRC} (\textit{\underline{S}tudent \underline{M}athematical \underline{R}easoning \underline{C}orrection}), a novel method that aligns LLMs with student reasoning. Specifically, \texttt{SMRC} formulates student reasoning as a multi-step sequential decision problem and introduces Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore optimal correction paths. To reduce the cost of the annotating process-level rewards, we leverage breadth-first search (BFS) guided by LLMs and final-answer evaluation to generate reward signals, which are then distributed across intermediate reasoning steps via a back-propagation mechanism, enabling fine-grained process supervision. Additionally, we construct a benchmark for high school mathematics, MSEB (Multi-Solution Error Benchmark), consisting of 158 instances that include problem statements, student solutions, and correct reasoning steps. We further propose a dual evaluation protocol centered on \textbf{solution accuracy} and \textbf{correct-step retention}, offering a comprehensive measure of educational applicability. Experiments demonstrate that \texttt{SMRC} significantly outperforms existing methods on two public datasets (ProcessBench and MR-GSM8K) and our MSEB in terms of effectiveness and overall performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated the ability to generalize well at many levels across domains, modalities, and even shown in-context learning capabilities. This enables research questions regarding how they can be used to encode physical information that is usually only available from scientific measurements, and loosely encoded in textual descriptions. Using astrophysics as a test bed, we investigate if LLM embeddings can codify physical summary statistics that are obtained from scientific measurements through two main questions: 1) Does prompting play a role on how those quantities are codified by the LLM? and 2) What aspects of language are most important in encoding the physics represented by the measurement? We investigate this using sparse autoencoders that extract interpretable features from the text.

Abstract: Historical and low-resource NLP remains challenging due to limited annotated data and domain mismatches with modern, web-sourced corpora. This paper outlines our work in using large language models (LLMs) to create ground-truth annotations for historical French (16th-20th centuries) and Chinese (1900-1950) texts. By leveraging LLM-generated ground truth on a subset of our corpus, we were able to fine-tune spaCy to achieve significant gains on period-specific tests for part-of-speech (POS) annotations, lemmatization, and named entity recognition (NER). Our results underscore the importance of domain-specific models and demonstrate that even relatively limited amounts of synthetic data can improve NLP tools for under-resourced corpora in computational humanities research.

TL;DR: VALOR是一个用于多模态投诉分析的验证感知学习框架，通过专家路由和思维链提示实现细粒度分类，在文本和图像信息融合的场景中优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有投诉分析方法主要依赖单模态短文本，而实际客服对话中用户会同时提供文本投诉和视觉证据，需要多模态方法来处理这种复杂场景。

Method: 提出VALOR框架，采用多专家推理设置，使用大规模生成模型和思维链提示进行决策，通过语义对齐分数和元融合策略确保模态间一致性。

Result: 在标注了细粒度方面和严重程度的多模态投诉数据集上评估，VALOR始终优于基线模型，特别是在信息分布在文本和图像中的复杂投诉场景中。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了多模态交互和专家验证在实际投诉理解系统中的价值，支持联合国可持续发展目标9和12，促进更负责任的产品设计和消费者服务。

Abstract: Existing approaches to complaint analysis largely rely on unimodal, short-form content such as tweets or product reviews. This work advances the field by leveraging multimodal, multi-turn customer support dialogues, where users often share both textual complaints and visual evidence (e.g., screenshots, product photos) to enable fine-grained classification of complaint aspects and severity. We introduce VALOR, a Validation-Aware Learner with Expert Routing, tailored for this multimodal setting. It employs a multi-expert reasoning setup using large-scale generative models with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for nuanced decision-making. To ensure coherence between modalities, a semantic alignment score is computed and integrated into the final classification through a meta-fusion strategy. In alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), the proposed framework supports SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) by advancing AI-driven tools for robust, scalable, and context-aware service infrastructure. Further, by enabling structured analysis of complaint narratives and visual context, it contributes to SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) by promoting more responsive product design and improved accountability in consumer services. We evaluate VALOR on a curated multimodal complaint dataset annotated with fine-grained aspect and severity labels, showing that it consistently outperforms baseline models, especially in complex complaint scenarios where information is distributed across text and images. This study underscores the value of multimodal interaction and expert validation in practical complaint understanding systems.

TL;DR: 比较库尔德语词嵌入的不同分词策略，发现基于语素的分词在全面评估中表现最佳，而BPE方法由于评估覆盖率不足导致性能虚高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究库尔德语词嵌入的分词策略，特别关注在低资源语言处理中如何选择合适的分词方法，以及现有评估方法可能存在的偏差问题。

Method: 开发了基于BiLSTM-CRF的形态分析器，使用最小手动标注进行引导训练，比较词级、基于语素和BPE三种分词方法，通过相似性保持、聚类质量和语义组织等综合指标评估Word2Vec嵌入。

Result: BPE在形态相似性上看似更优，但仅评估了28.6%的测试用例，而语素模型评估了68.7%；全面评估显示基于语素的分词在嵌入空间组织、语义邻域结构和跨形态复杂度覆盖方面表现更好。

Conclusion: 在低资源语言处理中，基于语素的分词策略优于BPE，同时强调了覆盖率感知评估的重要性，为低资源语言处理提供了不同的分词方法选择。

Abstract: We investigate tokenization strategies for Kurdish word embeddings by comparing word-level, morpheme-based, and BPE approaches on morphological similarity preservation tasks. We develop a BiLSTM-CRF morphological segmenter using bootstrapped training from minimal manual annotation and evaluate Word2Vec embeddings across comprehensive metrics including similarity preservation, clustering quality, and semantic organization. Our analysis reveals critical evaluation biases in tokenization comparison. While BPE initially appears superior in morphological similarity, it evaluates only 28.6\% of test cases compared to 68.7\% for morpheme model, creating artificial performance inflation. When assessed comprehensively, morpheme-based tokenization demonstrates superior embedding space organization, better semantic neighborhood structure, and more balanced coverage across morphological complexity levels. These findings highlight the importance of coverage-aware evaluation in low-resource language processing and offers different tokenization methods for low-resourced language processing.

TL;DR: XPINN框架通过动态域分解和Rankine-Hugoniot跳变条件，有效解决了非线性Buckley-Leverett方程中的陡峭梯度和间断问题，相比标准PINNs具有更好的稳定性和收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs在处理非线性双曲型偏微分方程时难以捕捉陡峭梯度、间断和复杂非线性波相互作用，特别是在多孔介质中非混相两相流的Buckley-Leverett方程中。

Method: 采用扩展物理信息神经网络(XPINN)框架，在时空域中动态分解为冲击前和冲击后区域，使用局部子网络学习不同流动行为，并通过Rankine-Hugoniot跳变条件实现子网络耦合。

Result: XPINN方法能够准确捕捉间断饱和度前沿和复合波相互作用，无需人工扩散或熵修正，相比标准PINNs具有更好的稳定性、更快的收敛速度和更强的非线性波动力学分辨率。

Conclusion: XPINN框架是解决多相流问题中挑战性双曲型偏微分方程的有效且可扩展工具，使用更小的领域特定模型和更少的可训练参数即可获得优越性能。

Abstract: The accurate solution of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) remains a central challenge in computational science due to the presence of steep gradients, discontinuities, and multiscale structures that make conventional discretization-based solvers computationally demanding. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed the governing equations into the learning process, enabling mesh-free solution of PDEs, yet they often struggle to capture steep gradients, discontinuities, and complex nonlinear wave interactions. To address these limitations, this study employs the Extended Physics-Informed Neural Network (XPINN) framework to solve the nonlinear Buckley-Leverett equation with a nonconvex flux function, which models immiscible two-phase flow in porous media. The computational domain is dynamically decomposed in space and time into evolving pre-shock and post-shock regions, allowing localized subnetworks to efficiently learn distinct flow behaviors. Coupling between subnetworks is achieved through the Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition, which enforces physically consistent flux continuity across the moving shock interface. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed XPINN approach accurately captures discontinuous saturation fronts and compound wave interactions without requiring artificial diffusion or entropy corrections. Compared to standard PINNs, the XPINN framework achieves superior stability, faster convergence, and enhanced resolution of nonlinear wave dynamics using smaller, domain-specific models with fewer trainable parameters, establishing it as an effective and scalable tool for solving challenging hyperbolic PDEs in multiphase flow problems. The code of this work is available on github.com/saifkhanengr/XPINN-for-Buckley-Leverett.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BLUE是一种轨迹表示学习方法，通过逐渐降低GPS坐标精度创建分层补丁，在保留细粒度时空细节的同时捕捉整体旅行模式，在多个下游任务中平均优于最佳基线30.90%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有最先进的轨迹表示学习方法将原始GPS轨迹转换为网格或道路轨迹以捕获高级旅行语义，但会丢失细粒度的时空细节，因为多个GPS点被分组到单个网格单元或道路段中。

Method: 提出BLUrred Encoding方法，通过逐渐降低GPS坐标精度创建具有多个层次的分层补丁。采用编码器-解码器金字塔结构，在每个补丁级别使用Transformer学习当前级别的轨迹嵌入，同时池化为编码器中更高级别准备输入，上采样为解码器中更低级别提供指导。使用轨迹重建任务和MSE损失进行训练。

Result: 与8个最先进的轨迹表示学习方法在3个下游任务上进行比较，结果显示BLUE始终比所有基线获得更高的准确率，平均优于最佳表现基线30.90%。

Conclusion: BLUE方法通过分层补丁设计有效平衡了细粒度时空细节和整体旅行模式的捕获，在轨迹表示学习任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Trajectory representation learning (TRL) maps trajectories to vector embeddings and facilitates tasks such as trajectory classification and similarity search. State-of-the-art (SOTA) TRL methods transform raw GPS trajectories to grid or road trajectories to capture high-level travel semantics, i.e., regions and roads. However, they lose fine-grained spatial-temporal details as multiple GPS points are grouped into a single grid cell or road segment. To tackle this problem, we propose the BLUrred Encoding method, dubbed BLUE, which gradually reduces the precision of GPS coordinates to create hierarchical patches with multiple levels. The low-level patches are small and preserve fine-grained spatial-temporal details, while the high-level patches are large and capture overall travel patterns. To complement different patch levels with each other, our BLUE is an encoder-decoder model with a pyramid structure. At each patch level, a Transformer is used to learn the trajectory embedding at the current level, while pooling prepares inputs for the higher level in the encoder, and up-resolution provides guidance for the lower level in the decoder. BLUE is trained using the trajectory reconstruction task with the MSE loss. We compare BLUE with 8 SOTA TRL methods for 3 downstream tasks, the results show that BLUE consistently achieves higher accuracy than all baselines, outperforming the best-performing baselines by an average of 30.90%.

TL;DR: DeepDefense是一个通过梯度特征对齐(GFA)正则化来增强深度神经网络对抗鲁棒性的防御框架，在多个层面对齐输入梯度和内部特征表示，从而抑制对抗性漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络容易受到对抗性扰动的影响，这些微小但精心设计的输入会导致错误预测。现有防御方法存在局限性，需要更有效的鲁棒性增强方案。

Method: 提出梯度特征对齐(GFA)正则化方法，在多个网络层面对齐输入梯度与内部特征表示，通过抑制切向方向的损失变化来平滑损失景观。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上，DeepDefense训练的CNN模型比标准对抗训练在APGD攻击下性能提升15.2%，在FGSM攻击下提升24.7%。对抗DeepFool和EADEN等优化攻击时，需要20-30倍更高的扰动幅度才能导致误分类。

Conclusion: DeepDefense提供了一种架构无关、易于实现且高效的对抗鲁棒性增强方法，通过梯度特征对齐机制显著提升了模型的鲁棒性表现。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, which are small and carefully crafted inputs that lead to incorrect predictions. In this paper, we propose DeepDefense, a novel defense framework that applies Gradient-Feature Alignment (GFA) regularization across multiple layers to suppress adversarial vulnerability. By aligning input gradients with internal feature representations, DeepDefense promotes a smoother loss landscape in tangential directions, thereby reducing the model's sensitivity to adversarial noise.
  We provide theoretical insights into how adversarial perturbation can be decomposed into radial and tangential components and demonstrate that alignment suppresses loss variation in tangential directions, where most attacks are effective. Empirically, our method achieves significant improvements in robustness across both gradient-based and optimization-based attacks. For example, on CIFAR-10, CNN models trained with DeepDefense outperform standard adversarial training by up to 15.2% under APGD attacks and 24.7% under FGSM attacks. Against optimization-based attacks such as DeepFool and EADEN, DeepDefense requires 20 to 30 times higher perturbation magnitudes to cause misclassification, indicating stronger decision boundaries and a flatter loss landscape. Our approach is architecture-agnostic, simple to implement, and highly effective, offering a promising direction for improving the adversarial robustness of deep learning models.

Conclusion: 通过直接将提示与潜在方向关联，SCALEX使扩散模型中的偏见分析比先前方法更具可扩展性、可解释性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Image generation models frequently encode social biases, including stereotypes tied to gender, race, and profession. Existing methods for analyzing these biases in diffusion models either focus narrowly on predefined categories or depend on manual interpretation of latent directions. These constraints limit scalability and hinder the discovery of subtle or unanticipated patterns.
  We introduce SCALEX, a framework for scalable and automated exploration of diffusion model latent spaces. SCALEX extracts semantically meaningful directions from H-space using only natural language prompts, enabling zero-shot interpretation without retraining or labelling. This allows systematic comparison across arbitrary concepts and large-scale discovery of internal model associations. We show that SCALEX detects gender bias in profession prompts, ranks semantic alignment across identity descriptors, and reveals clustered conceptual structure without supervision. By linking prompts to latent directions directly, SCALEX makes bias analysis in diffusion models more scalable, interpretable, and extensible than prior approaches.

Abstract: A Brain Computer Interface (BCI) connects the human brain to the outside world, providing a direct communication channel. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are commonly used in BCIs to reflect cognitive patterns related to motor function activities. However, due to the multichannel nature of EEG signals, explicit information processing is crucial to lessen computational complexity in BCI systems. This study proposes an innovative method based on brain region-specific channel selection and multi-domain feature fusion to improve classification accuracy. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in region-based channel selection, where EEG channels are grouped according to their functional relevance to distinct brain regions. By selecting channels based on specific regions involved in motor imagery (MI) tasks, this technique eliminates irrelevant channels, reducing data dimensionality and improving computational efficiency. This also ensures that the extracted features are more reflective of the brain actual activity related to motor tasks. Three distinct feature extraction methods Common Spatial Pattern (CSP), Fuzzy C-means clustering, and Tangent Space Mapping (TSM), are applied to each group of channels based on their brain region. Each method targets different characteristics of the EEG signal: CSP focuses on spatial patterns, Fuzzy C means identifies clusters within the data, and TSM captures non-linear patterns in the signal. The combined feature vector is used to classify motor imagery tasks (left hand, right hand, and right foot) using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The proposed method was validated on publicly available benchmark EEG datasets (IVA and I) from the BCI competition III and IV. The results show that the approach outperforms existing methods, achieving classification accuracies of 90.77% and 84.50% for datasets IVA and I, respectively.

Conclusion: 研究首次揭示了LLM驱动自动驾驶模型在车辆交互场景中的对抗脆弱性，强调了未来基于LLM的智能交通系统需要面向鲁棒性进行设计。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into automated driving systems has opened new possibilities for reasoning and decision-making by transforming complex driving contexts into language-understandable representations. Recent studies demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs can accurately predict vehicle trajectories and lane-change intentions by gathering and transforming data from surrounding vehicles. However, the robustness of such LLM-based prediction models for safety-critical driving systems remains unexplored, despite the increasing concerns about the trustworthiness of LLMs. This study addresses this gap by conducting a systematic vulnerability analysis of LLM-enabled vehicle trajectory prediction. We propose a one-feature differential evolution attack that perturbs a single kinematic feature of surrounding vehicles within the LLM's input prompts under a black-box setting. Experiments on the highD dataset reveal that even minor, physically plausible perturbations can significantly disrupt model outputs, underscoring the susceptibility of LLM-based predictors to adversarial manipulation. Further analyses reveal a trade-off between accuracy and robustness, examine the failure mechanism, and explore potential mitigation solutions. The findings provide the very first insights into adversarial vulnerabilities of LLM-driven automated vehicle models in the context of vehicular interactions and highlight the need for robustness-oriented design in future LLM-based intelligent transportation systems.

Result: 实验表明该方法在大多数场景下优于当前主流方法，消融实验验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: RedReg方法通过自适应冗余调节有效解决了多模态学习中的模态偏差问题，实现了更平衡的多模态信息优化

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to improve performance by leveraging data from multiple sources. During joint multimodal training, due to modality bias, the advantaged modality often dominates backpropagation, leading to imbalanced optimization. Existing methods still face two problems: First, the long-term dominance of the dominant modality weakens representation-output coupling in the late stages of training, resulting in the accumulation of redundant information. Second, previous methods often directly and uniformly adjust the gradients of the advantaged modality, ignoring the semantics and directionality between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Redundancy Regulation for Balanced Multimodal Information Refinement (RedReg), which is inspired by information bottleneck principle. Specifically, we construct a redundancy phase monitor that uses a joint criterion of effective gain growth rate and redundancy to trigger intervention only when redundancy is high. Furthermore, we design a co-information gating mechanism to estimate the contribution of the current dominant modality based on cross-modal semantics. When the task primarily relies on a single modality, the suppression term is automatically disabled to preserve modality-specific information. Finally, we project the gradient of the dominant modality onto the orthogonal complement of the joint multimodal gradient subspace and suppress the gradient according to redundancy. Experiments show that our method demonstrates superiority among current major methods in most scenarios. Ablation experiments verify the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting is not only a way to add more information to a prediction of the future, but it also builds on weaknesses in point prediction. Sudden changes in a time series can still be captured by a cumulative distribution function (CDF), while a point prediction is likely to miss it entirely. The modeling of CDFs within forecasts has historically been limited to parametric approaches, but due to recent advances, this no longer has to be the case. We aim to advance the fields of probabilistic forecasting and monotonic networks by connecting them and propose an approach that permits the forecasting of implicit, complete, and nonparametric CDFs. For this purpose, we propose an adaptation to deep lattice networks (DLN) for monotonically constrained simultaneous/implicit quantile regression in time series forecasting. Quantile regression usually produces quantile crossovers, which need to be prevented to achieve a legitimate CDF. By leveraging long short term memory units (LSTM) as the embedding layer, and spreading quantile inputs to all sub-lattices of a DLN with an extended output size, we can produce a multi-horizon forecast of an implicit CDF due to the monotonic constraintability of DLNs that prevent quantile crossovers. We compare and evaluate our approach's performance to relevant state of the art within the context of a highly relevant application of time series forecasting: Day-ahead, hourly forecasts of solar irradiance observations. Our experiments show that the adaptation of a DLN performs just as well or even better than an unconstrained approach. Further comparison of the adapted DLN against a scalable monotonic neural network shows that our approach performs better. With this adaptation of DLNs, we intend to create more interest and crossover investigations in techniques of monotonic neural networks and probabilistic forecasting.

Abstract: Deep learning-based molecular generation models have shown great potential in efficiently exploring vast chemical spaces by generating potential drug candidates with desired properties. However, these models often produce chemically invalid molecules, which limits the usable scope of the learned chemical space and poses significant challenges for practical applications. To address this issue, we propose ChemFixer, a framework designed to correct invalid molecules into valid ones. ChemFixer is built on a transformer architecture, pre-trained using masking techniques, and fine-tuned on a large-scale dataset of valid/invalid molecular pairs that we constructed. Through comprehensive evaluations across diverse generative models, ChemFixer improved molecular validity while effectively preserving the chemical and biological distributional properties of the original outputs. This indicates that ChemFixer can recover molecules that could not be previously generated, thereby expanding the diversity of potential drug candidates. Furthermore, ChemFixer was effectively applied to a drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction task using limited data, improving the validity of generated ligands and discovering promising ligand-protein pairs. These results suggest that ChemFixer is not only effective in data-limited scenarios, but also extensible to a wide range of downstream tasks. Taken together, ChemFixer shows promise as a practical tool for various stages of deep learning-based drug discovery, enhancing molecular validity and expanding accessible chemical space.

Motivation: 社交媒体冒犯性内容检测需要高质量标注数据，但由于冒犯性实例稀少和人工标注成本高，这类数据往往稀缺。需要解决低资源场景下的检测挑战。

Method: 使用轻量级分类器和多智能体视觉语言模型协作进行伪标注，将无标签数据分为一致未知集和冲突未知集，并采用正负未知损失函数来优化分类器。

Conclusion: 提出的自训练框架通过有效利用无标签数据和协作伪标注，成功解决了低资源场景下的冒犯性内容检测问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Accurate detection of offensive content on social media demands high-quality labeled data; however, such data is often scarce due to the low prevalence of offensive instances and the high cost of manual annotation. To address this low-resource challenge, we propose a self-training framework that leverages abundant unlabeled data through collaborative pseudo-labeling. Starting with a lightweight classifier trained on limited labeled data, our method iteratively assigns pseudo-labels to unlabeled instances with the support of Multi-Agent Vision-Language Models (MA-VLMs). Un-labeled data on which the classifier and MA-VLMs agree are designated as the Agreed-Unknown set, while conflicting samples form the Disagreed-Unknown set. To enhance label reliability, MA-VLMs simulate dual perspectives, moderator and user, capturing both regulatory and subjective viewpoints. The classifier is optimized using a novel Positive-Negative-Unlabeled (PNU) loss, which jointly exploits labeled, Agreed-Unknown, and Disagreed-Unknown data while mitigating pseudo-label noise. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework substantially outperforms baselines under limited supervision and approaches the performance of large-scale models

TL;DR: MoETTA是一个基于熵的测试时自适应框架，集成混合专家架构来处理混合分布偏移问题，通过多个结构解耦的专家实现多样化的梯度方向适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界部署中常遇到混合分布偏移，现有TTA方法依赖统一适应路径，无法处理不同域间可能冲突的最优梯度方向，且当前基准测试只关注合成或同质偏移。

Method: 提出MoETTA框架，引入一组结构解耦的专家，使模型能够沿不同梯度方向进行适应，实现灵活和分离的参数更新。还提出了potpourri和potpourri+两个新基准测试来模拟真实部署条件。

Result: 在三个混合分布偏移设置上的广泛实验表明，MoETTA始终优于强基线方法，建立了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MoETTA通过专家级多样性建模多个适应方向，能更好地适应异构偏移，在混合分布偏移场景下表现出色。

Abstract: Test-Time adaptation (TTA) has proven effective in mitigating performance drops under single-domain distribution shifts by updating model parameters during inference. However, real-world deployments often involve mixed distribution shifts, where test samples are affected by diverse and potentially conflicting domain factors, posing significant challenges even for SOTA TTA methods. A key limitation in existing approaches is their reliance on a unified adaptation path, which fails to account for the fact that optimal gradient directions can vary significantly across different domains. Moreover, current benchmarks focus only on synthetic or homogeneous shifts, failing to capture the complexity of real-world heterogeneous mixed distribution shifts. To address this, we propose MoETTA, a novel entropy-based TTA framework that integrates the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Rather than enforcing a single parameter update rule for all test samples, MoETTA introduces a set of structurally decoupled experts, enabling adaptation along diverse gradient directions. This design allows the model to better accommodate heterogeneous shifts through flexible and disentangled parameter updates. To simulate realistic deployment conditions, we introduce two new benchmarks: potpourri and potpourri+. While classical settings focus solely on synthetic corruptions, potpourri encompasses a broader range of domain shifts--including natural, artistic, and adversarial distortions--capturing more realistic deployment challenges. Additionally, potpourri+ further includes source-domain samples to evaluate robustness against catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments across three mixed distribution shifts settings show that MoETTA consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing SOTA performance and highlighting the benefit of modeling multiple adaptation directions via expert-level diversity.

TL;DR: 该研究将增量学习框架从计算机视觉中的类别扩展到生物学中的基因标记，针对单细胞转录组数据建立了基因增量学习管道和评估体系，并验证了现有类别增量学习方法在缓解基因遗忘问题上的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然类别在计算机视觉的增量学习中已被广泛研究，但标记（如基因）的增量学习研究严重不足，主要因为语言标记的整体性特征给增量学习框架设计带来挑战。

Method: 转向生物学中的基因标记，针对单细胞转录组数据建立基因增量学习管道和评估体系，并适配现有的类别增量学习方法来缓解基因遗忘问题。

Result: 通过大量实验证明了框架设计和评估的合理性，以及方法适配的有效性，确认了基因增量学习中同样存在遗忘问题。

Conclusion: 为单细胞转录组学中的基因增量学习提供了一个完整的基准，填补了标记增量学习的研究空白。

Abstract: Classes, as fundamental elements of Computer Vision, have been extensively studied within incremental learning frameworks. In contrast, tokens, which play essential roles in many research fields, exhibit similar characteristics of growth, yet investigations into their incremental learning remain significantly scarce. This research gap primarily stems from the holistic nature of tokens in language, which imposes significant challenges on the design of incremental learning frameworks for them. To overcome this obstacle, in this work, we turn to a type of token, gene, for a large-scale biological dataset--single-cell transcriptomics--to formulate a pipeline for gene incremental learning and establish corresponding evaluations. We found that the forgetting problem also exists in gene incremental learning, thus we adapted existing class incremental learning methods to mitigate the forgetting of genes. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrated the soundness of our framework design and evaluations, as well as the effectiveness of our method adaptations. Finally, we provide a complete benchmark for gene incremental learning in single-cell transcriptomics.

Motivation: AI和机器学习工作负载快速发展，但实现接近峰值性能仍需硬件专家手动编写特定内核或依赖专用库，这增加了复杂性并限制了大多数ML从业者的可扩展性。

Method: 使用MLIR方言桥接领域级操作和处理器能力，通过从低层IR构造组合纳米内核，实现接近最优的寄存器利用，形成针对每个目标的高效微内核。

Result: 实验表明生成的纳米内核达到生产质量，与最先进的微内核库具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 该编译方案成功消除了对低层库的依赖，使编译器能够直接自动生成接近最优的代码，支持向量和基于tile的CPU指令。

Abstract: The rapidly evolving landscape of AI and machine learning workloads has widened the gap between high-level domain operations and efficient hardware utilization. Achieving near-peak performance still demands deep hardware expertise-experts either handcraft target-specific kernels (e.g., DeepSeek) or rely on specialized libraries (e.g., CUTLASS)-both of which add complexity and limit scalability for most ML practitioners.
  This paper introduces a compilation scheme that automatically generates scalable, high-performance microkernels by leveraging the MLIR dialects to bridge domain-level operations and processor capabilities. Our approach removes dependence on low-level libraries by enabling the compiler to auto-generate near-optimal code directly. At its core is a mechanism for composing nanokernels from low-level IR constructs with near-optimal register utilization, forming efficient microkernels tailored to each target. We implement this technique in an MLIR-based compiler supporting both vector and tile based CPU instructions. Experiments show that the generated nanokernels are of production-quality, and competitive with state-of-the-art microkernel libraries.

TL;DR: PROF框架利用LLM从自然语言描述和单个专家轨迹生成可执行奖励函数代码，通过奖励偏好排序(RPR)评估奖励函数质量，无需环境交互或RL训练，在D4RL基准上超越或匹配现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离线模仿学习方法假设轨迹与专家演示的相似度与奖励正相关，这过度简化了奖励结构。需要更准确的方法来估计未标记数据集的奖励。

Method: 提出PROF框架：1) 使用LLM从自然语言和专家轨迹生成奖励函数代码；2) 提出RPR策略评估奖励函数质量，计算支配分数；3) 通过RPR和基于文本的梯度优化交替选择优化奖励函数。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，PROF在多个数据集和领域上超越或匹配了最近的强基线方法。

Conclusion: PROF框架通过自动化奖励函数生成和优化，有效提升了离线模仿学习的性能，证明了LLM在奖励函数设计中的有效性。

Abstract: Offline imitation learning (offline IL) enables training effective policies without requiring explicit reward annotations. Recent approaches attempt to estimate rewards for unlabeled datasets using a small set of expert demonstrations. However, these methods often assume that the similarity between a trajectory and an expert demonstration is positively correlated with the reward, which oversimplifies the underlying reward structure. We propose PROF, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate and improve executable reward function codes from natural language descriptions and a single expert trajectory. We propose Reward Preference Ranking (RPR), a novel reward function quality assessment and ranking strategy without requiring environment interactions or RL training. RPR calculates the dominance scores of the reward functions, where higher scores indicate better alignment with expert preferences. By alternating between RPR and text-based gradient optimization, PROF fully automates the selection and refinement of optimal reward functions for downstream policy learning. Empirical results on D4RL demonstrate that PROF surpasses or matches recent strong baselines across numerous datasets and domains, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 研究多维随机场模型重构中的维度灾难问题，探索在异构噪声情况下如何缓解维度对收敛率的影响。

Method: 使用Wasserstein距离方法训练随机神经网络，改进原有训练方法，并通过数值实验验证。

Result: 当噪声在维度间异构时，泛化误差收敛率可能不显式依赖于模型维度，部分缓解了维度灾难问题。数值实验表明该方法能成功训练SNN学习多维不确定性模型。

Conclusion: Wasserstein距离方法能有效训练随机神经网络重构多维随机场模型，在异构噪声条件下可部分克服维度灾难问题，展示了SNN的鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the scalability of a recent Wasserstein-distance approach for training stochastic neural networks (SNNs) to reconstruct multidimensional random field models. We prove a generalization error bound for reconstructing multidimensional random field models on training stochastic neural networks with a limited number of training data. Our results indicate that when noise is heterogeneous across dimensions, the convergence rate of the generalization error may not depend explicitly on the model's dimensionality, partially alleviating the "curse of dimensionality" for learning multidimensional random field models from a finite number of data points. Additionally, we improve the previous Wasserstein-distance SNN training approach and showcase the robustness of the SNN. Through numerical experiments on different multidimensional uncertainty quantification tasks, we show that our Wasserstein-distance approach can successfully train stochastic neural networks to learn multidimensional uncertainty models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度集成在量化预测不确定性和区分其偶然性和认知性成分方面表现出色，但其在推理时的高计算和内存成本限制了实际部署。

Method: 通过置信集成蒸馏框架，将深度集成压缩为单个模型CREDIT，该模型预测类别概率区间而非单一softmax分布，定义了一个概率分布的凸集（置信集）进行不确定性量化。

Result: 在分布外检测基准测试中，CED实现了优于或与现有基线相当的不确定性估计，同时相比深度集成显著减少了推理开销。

Conclusion: 置信集成蒸馏是一种有效的深度集成压缩方法，能够在保持不确定性估计性能的同时大幅降低推理成本。

Abstract: Deep ensembles (DE) have emerged as a powerful approach for quantifying predictive uncertainty and distinguishing its aleatoric and epistemic components, thereby enhancing model robustness and reliability. However, their high computational and memory costs during inference pose significant challenges for wide practical deployment. To overcome this issue, we propose credal ensemble distillation (CED), a novel framework that compresses a DE into a single model, CREDIT, for classification tasks. Instead of a single softmax probability distribution, CREDIT predicts class-wise probability intervals that define a credal set, a convex set of probability distributions, for uncertainty quantification. Empirical results on out-of-distribution detection benchmarks demonstrate that CED achieves superior or comparable uncertainty estimation compared to several existing baselines, while substantially reducing inference overhead compared to DE.

TL;DR: 提出动态温度调度器(DTS)，根据师生模型分布差异动态调整知识蒸馏中的温度参数，优于固定温度方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏使用固定温度参数，但学生模型在训练不同阶段需要不同软度的概率分布，且师生模型架构差异导致logit幅度不匹配。

Method: DTS基于师生模型交叉熵损失差距动态调整温度，早期使用较软概率，后期使用较尖锐概率，可无缝集成到现有KD框架。

Result: 在视觉(CIFAR-100、Tiny-ImageNet)和NLP任务(GLUE、Dolly等)上验证，DTS始终优于静态温度基线方法。

Conclusion: 动态温度调度是知识蒸馏中有效的改进方法，能根据训练阶段自适应调整温度参数，提升学生模型性能。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) trains a smaller student model using a large, pre-trained teacher model, with temperature as a key hyperparameter controlling the softness of output probabilities. Traditional methods use a fixed temperature throughout training, which is suboptimal. Moreover, architectural differences between teacher and student often result in mismatched logit magnitudes. We demonstrate that students benefit from softer probabilities early in training but require sharper probabilities in later stages. We introduce Dynamic Temperature Scheduler (DTS), which adjusts temperature dynamically based on the cross-entropy loss gap between teacher and student. To our knowledge, this is the first temperature scheduling method that adapts based on the divergence between teacher and student distributions. Our method integrates seamlessly with existing KD frameworks. We validate DTS across multiple KD strategies on vision (CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet) and NLP tasks (GLUE, Dolly, SelfIns, UnNI, S-NI), consistently outperforming static-temperature baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/Sibgat-Ul/DTS.

Conclusion: 线性编程语言为直接编程神经网络提供了路径，实现了学习与普通编程离散结构之间的有效结合。

Abstract: We don't program neural networks directly. Instead, we rely on an indirect style where learning algorithms, like gradient descent, determine a neural network's function by learning from data. This indirect style is often a virtue; it empowers us to solve problems that were previously impossible. But it lacks discrete structure. We can't compile most algorithms into a neural network -- even if these algorithms could help the network learn. This limitation occurs because discrete algorithms are not obviously differentiable, making them incompatible with the gradient-based learning algorithms that determine a neural network's function. To address this, we introduce $\textsf{Cajal}$: a typed, higher-order and linear programming language intended to be a minimal vehicle for exploring a direct style of programming neural networks. We prove $\textsf{Cajal}$ programs compile to linear neurons, allowing discrete algorithms to be expressed in a differentiable form compatible with gradient-based learning. With our implementation of $\textsf{Cajal}$, we conduct several experiments where we link these linear neurons against other neural networks to determine part of their function prior to learning. Linking with these neurons allows networks to learn faster, with greater data-efficiency, and in a way that's easier to debug. A key lesson is that linear programming languages provide a path towards directly programming neural networks, enabling a rich interplay between learning and the discrete structures of ordinary programming.

Motivation: 揭示Transformer架构中自注意力机制背后的数学原理，证明其特定代数形式源于投影原则而非任意设计选择。

Method: 从GloVe嵌入的共现矩阵出发，展示投影如何自然捕捉上下文影响，查询-键-值机制作为建模方向关系的自然不对称扩展出现。

Result: 证明了位置编码和多头注意力都是同一投影原则的结构化改进，自注意力机制从分布语义学原理中自然涌现。

Conclusion: Transformer架构的特定代数形式遵循这些投影原则，而不是任意的设计选择，为理解自注意力提供了数学基础。

Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical interpretation of self-attention by connecting it to distributional semantics principles. We show that self-attention emerges from projecting corpus-level co-occurrence statistics into sequence context. Starting from the co-occurrence matrix underlying GloVe embeddings, we demonstrate how the projection naturally captures contextual influence, with the query-key-value mechanism arising as the natural asymmetric extension for modeling directional relationships. Positional encodings and multi-head attention then follow as structured refinements of this same projection principle. Our analysis demonstrates that the Transformer architecture's particular algebraic form follows from these projection principles rather than being an arbitrary design choice.

TL;DR: 本文研究了自监督学习(SSL)的表征可迁移性，提出了任务冲突校准(TC²)方法来提升SSL模型的可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索SSL的表征可迁移性，解决两个核心问题：(i)SSL的表征可迁移性是什么，(ii)如何有效建模这种可迁移性。可迁移性定义为从一个任务学到的表征支持另一个任务目标的能力。

Method: 受元学习启发，在每个训练批次内构建多个SSL任务来显式建模可迁移性。提出TC²方法：首先分割批次创建多个SSL任务并注入任务级信息；然后使用因子提取网络生成所有任务的因果生成因子，使用权重提取网络为每个样本分配专用权重；最后在校准样本表征后通过两阶段双层优化框架集成到训练流程中。

Result: 在多个下游任务上的实验结果表明，该方法能持续提升SSL模型的可迁移性。

Conclusion: TC²方法通过缓解任务冲突有效提升了SSL表征的可迁移性，为SSL的跨任务应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the transferability of SSL by addressing two central questions: (i) what is the representation transferability of SSL, and (ii) how can we effectively model this transferability? Transferability is defined as the ability of a representation learned from one task to support the objective of another.
  Inspired by the meta-learning paradigm, we construct multiple SSL tasks within each training batch to support explicitly modeling transferability. Based on empirical evidence and causal analysis, we find that although introducing task-level information improves transferability, it is still hindered by task conflict. To address this issue, we propose a Task Conflict Calibration (TC$^2$) method to alleviate the impact of task conflict. Specifically, it first splits batches to create multiple SSL tasks, infusing task-level information. Next, it uses a factor extraction network to produce causal generative factors for all tasks and a weight extraction network to assign dedicated weights to each sample, employing data reconstruction, orthogonality, and sparsity to ensure effectiveness. Finally, TC$^2$ calibrates sample representations during SSL training and integrates into the pipeline via a two-stage bi-level optimization framework to boost the transferability of learned representations. Experimental results on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that our method consistently improves the transferability of SSL models.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在对抗性交互中，攻击者与目标模型的大小比例与有害行为发生率呈正相关，模型规模不对称会影响安全鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在多智能体和安全关键环境中应用增多，需要了解模型在对抗性交互中的脆弱性如何随规模变化，特别是大型模型是否能够系统性地破解小型模型的安全防护。

Method: 使用JailbreakBench标准化对抗任务，模拟了6000多次多轮攻击者-目标模型交互，涵盖0.6B-120B参数的多个LLM家族，通过三个独立LLM法官评估危害分数和拒绝行为。

Result: 攻击者与目标模型大小比例的对数与平均危害分数呈强正相关（Pearson r=0.51），攻击者方行为多样性对对抗结果影响更大，攻击者拒绝频率与危害呈强负相关（rho=-0.93）。

Conclusion: 模型规模不对称会影响鲁棒性，攻击者方的对齐程度能够减轻有害响应，这为研究模型间对齐和安全提供了探索性证据。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly operate in multi-agent and safety-critical settings, raising open questions about how their vulnerabilities scale when models interact adversarially. This study examines whether larger models can systematically jailbreak smaller ones - eliciting harmful or restricted behavior despite alignment safeguards. Using standardized adversarial tasks from JailbreakBench, we simulate over 6,000 multi-turn attacker-target exchanges across major LLM families and scales (0.6B-120B parameters), measuring both harm score and refusal behavior as indicators of adversarial potency and alignment integrity. Each interaction is evaluated through aggregated harm and refusal scores assigned by three independent LLM judges, providing a consistent, model-based measure of adversarial outcomes. Aggregating results across prompts, we find a strong and statistically significant correlation between mean harm and the logarithm of the attacker-to-target size ratio (Pearson r = 0.51, p < 0.001; Spearman rho = 0.52, p < 0.001), indicating that relative model size correlates with the likelihood and severity of harmful completions. Mean harm score variance is higher across attackers (0.18) than across targets (0.10), suggesting that attacker-side behavioral diversity contributes more to adversarial outcomes than target susceptibility. Attacker refusal frequency is strongly and negatively correlated with harm (rho = -0.93, p < 0.001), showing that attacker-side alignment mitigates harmful responses. These findings reveal that size asymmetry influences robustness and provide exploratory evidence for adversarial scaling patterns, motivating more controlled investigations into inter-model alignment and safety.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的可微分全局可解释性方法，通过在模型训练中直接集成特征重要性估计，使用ScoresActivation函数实现特征排序，实现高保真度、稳定的特征重要性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的事后解释方法与模型训练过程脱节，限制了其忠实性和实用性，需要开发与训练过程集成的可解释性方法。

Method: 引入ScoresActivation函数作为特征排序机制，将其嵌入学习流程中，使模型能够以可微分和端到端可训练的方式根据特征对预测性能的贡献进行优先级排序。

Result: 在基准数据集上的评估显示，该方法产生与SHAP值和真实特征重要性一致的全局忠实、稳定的特征排序，同时保持高预测性能。特征评分速度比SHAP快150倍，在相同配置下仅需2秒，而SHAP需要300秒。使用10个特征（5个相关）时分类准确率提高11.24%，使用16个特征（5个相关，11个无关）时提高29.33%。

Conclusion: 这项工作弥合了模型准确性和可解释性之间的差距，为固有可解释的机器学习提供了一个可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Understanding the decision of large deep learning models is a critical challenge for building transparent and trustworthy systems. Although the current post hoc explanation methods offer valuable insights into feature importance, they are inherently disconnected from the model training process, limiting their faithfulness and utility. In this work, we introduce a novel differentiable approach to global explainability by design, integrating feature importance estimation directly into model training. Central to our method is the ScoresActivation function, a feature-ranking mechanism embedded within the learning pipeline. This integration enables models to prioritize features according to their contribution to predictive performance in a differentiable and end-to-end trainable manner. Evaluations across benchmark datasets show that our approach yields globally faithful, stable feature rankings aligned with SHAP values and ground-truth feature importance, while maintaining high predictive performance. Moreover, feature scoring is 150 times faster than the classical SHAP method, requiring only 2 seconds during training compared to SHAP's 300 seconds for feature ranking in the same configuration. Our method also improves classification accuracy by 11.24% with 10 features (5 relevant) and 29.33% with 16 features (5 relevant, 11 irrelevant), demonstrating robustness to irrelevant inputs. This work bridges the gap between model accuracy and interpretability, offering a scalable framework for inherently explainable machine learning.

Conclusion: 分布感知的推测解码能够显著加速RL后训练，且不损害学习质量。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning(RL) post-training has become essential for aligning large language models (LLMs), yet its efficiency is increasingly constrained by the rollout phase, where long trajectories are generated token by token. We identify a major bottleneck:the long-tail distribution of rollout lengths, where a small fraction of long generations dominates wall clock time and a complementary opportunity; the availability of historical rollouts that reveal stable prompt level patterns across training epochs. Motivated by these observations, we propose DAS, a Distribution Aware Speculative decoding framework that accelerates RL rollouts without altering model outputs. DAS integrates two key ideas: an adaptive, nonparametric drafter built from recent rollouts using an incrementally maintained suffix tree, and a length aware speculation policy that allocates more aggressive draft budgets to long trajectories that dominate makespan. This design exploits rollout history to sustain acceptance while balancing base and token level costs during decoding. Experiments on math and code reasoning tasks show that DAS reduces rollout time up to 50% while preserving identical training curves, demonstrating that distribution-aware speculative decoding can significantly accelerate RL post training without compromising learning quality.

TL;DR: 提出AnaCP方法解决类增量学习中预训练模型无法持续适应特征表示的问题，在保持分析分类器效率的同时实现无梯度训练的特征适应


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CIL方法存在灾难性遗忘问题，现有基于预训练模型的方法虽然高效但无法持续优化特征表示，导致性能受限

Method: AnaCP（分析对比投影）方法，通过分析对比投影实现增量特征适应，无需基于梯度的训练，避免梯度更新导致的灾难性遗忘

Result: 实验表明AnaCP不仅超越现有基线方法，还达到了联合训练的准确率水平（被视为CIL的上限）

Conclusion: AnaCP成功解决了预训练模型在类增量学习中的特征适应问题，实现了高效且无灾难性遗忘的持续学习

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of class-incremental learning (CIL), a core setting within continual learning where a model learns a sequence of tasks, each containing a distinct set of classes. Traditional CIL methods, which do not leverage pre-trained models (PTMs), suffer from catastrophic forgetting (CF) due to the need to incrementally learn both feature representations and the classifier. The integration of PTMs into CIL has recently led to efficient approaches that treat the PTM as a fixed feature extractor combined with analytic classifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, they still face a major limitation: the inability to continually adapt feature representations to best suit the CIL tasks, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose AnaCP (Analytic Contrastive Projection), a novel method that preserves the efficiency of analytic classifiers while enabling incremental feature adaptation without gradient-based training, thereby eliminating the CF caused by gradient updates. Our experiments show that AnaCP not only outperforms existing baselines but also achieves the accuracy level of joint training, which is regarded as the upper bound of CIL.

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用可处理概率模型（TPMs），特别是和积网络（SPNs）来改进电力系统投资规划中的长期不确定性预测，替代传统的有限场景分析方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统电力系统投资规划方法使用有限数量的场景（统计上建模为Dirac混合），这限制了场景特定波动性的洞察并阻碍了稳健决策。需要一种能够处理数十年深度不确定性的更好方法。

Method: 使用可处理概率模型（TPMs），特别是和积网络（SPNs），这些模型能够进行精确、可扩展的关键量推断，如场景似然、边际概率和条件概率。

Result: 该框架能够将机会约束优化直接嵌入投资规划中，以规定的置信水平强制执行安全或可靠性要求。通过代表性电力系统规划案例研究展示了计算和可靠性优势。

Conclusion: TPMs方法在电力系统投资规划中比传统基于场景的模型具有更好的计算性能和可靠性，能够紧凑表示高维不确定性并支持稳健的场景扩展和风险评估。

Abstract: Investment planning in power utilities, such as generation and transmission expansion, requires decade-long forecasts under profound uncertainty. Forecasting of energy mix and energy use decades ahead is nontrivial. Classical approaches focus on generating a finite number of scenarios (modeled as a mixture of Diracs in statistical theory terms), which limits insight into scenario-specific volatility and hinders robust decision-making. We propose an alternative using tractable probabilistic models (TPMs), particularly sum-product networks (SPNs). These models enable exact, scalable inference of key quantities such as scenario likelihoods, marginals, and conditional probabilities, supporting robust scenario expansion and risk assessment.
  This framework enables direct embedding of chance-constrained optimization into investment planning, enforcing safety or reliability with prescribed confidence levels. TPMs allow both scenario analysis and volatility quantification by compactly representing high-dimensional uncertainties. We demonstrate the approach's effectiveness through a representative power system planning case study, illustrating computational and reliability advantages over traditional scenario-based models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MargNet是一种用于差分隐私表格数据合成的神经网络方法，通过将统计模型的成功算法设计融入神经网络，在稀疏相关数据集上接近最佳统计方法的效用，在密集相关数据集上建立新的最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有共识认为统计模型优于基于神经网络的方法，但这一结论不完整，忽视了密集相关数据集的挑战。神经网络因其从样本直接学习复杂分布的能力，在复杂场景中更合适，但现有NN算法仍有显著局限性。

Method: MargNet将统计模型的成功算法设计融入神经网络，采用自适应边际选择策略，训练神经网络生成符合选定边际的数据。

Result: 在稀疏相关数据集上，方法效用接近最佳统计方法，同时提供平均7倍加速；在密集相关数据集上，MargNet建立新的最先进水平，相比之前最佳方法将保真度误差降低高达26%。

Conclusion: MargNet证明了神经网络在差分隐私表格数据合成中的潜力，特别是在处理密集相关数据集时优于传统统计方法。

Abstract: In differentially private (DP) tabular data synthesis, the consensus is that statistical models are better than neural network (NN)-based methods. However, we argue that this conclusion is incomplete and overlooks the challenge of densely correlated datasets, where intricate dependencies can overwhelm statistical models. In such complex scenarios, neural networks are more suitable due to their capacity to fit complex distributions by learning directly from samples. Despite this potential, existing NN-based algorithms still suffer from significant limitations. We therefore propose MargNet, incorporating successful algorithmic designs of statistical models into neural networks. MargNet applies an adaptive marginal selection strategy and trains the neural networks to generate data that conforms to the selected marginals. On sparsely correlated datasets, our approach achieves utility close to the best statistical method while offering an average 7$\times$ speedup over it. More importantly, on densely correlated datasets, MargNet establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing fidelity error by up to 26\% compared to the previous best. We release our code on GitHub.\footnote{https://github.com/KaiChen9909/margnet}

Motivation: 现有方法未能有效整合天气模式的空间背景与时间演化，而准确的可再生能源预测对于减少化石燃料依赖和实现电网脱碳至关重要。

Method: 使用轻量级CNN将小时天气图编码为空间token，然后通过transformer处理以捕捉45小时预测范围内的时序动态。

Result: 与ENTSO-E运营预测相比，风能和太阳能的RMSE分别降低了约60%和20%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过将天气图作为token处理，成功整合了空间和时间信息，显著提高了可再生能源预测的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate renewable energy forecasting is essential to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and enabling grid decarbonization. However, current approaches fail to effectively integrate the rich spatial context of weather patterns with their temporal evolution. This work introduces a novel approach that treats weather maps as tokens in transformer sequences to predict renewable energy. Hourly weather maps are encoded as spatial tokens using a lightweight convolutional neural network, and then processed by a transformer to capture temporal dynamics across a 45-hour forecast horizon. Despite disadvantages in input initialization, evaluation against ENTSO-E operational forecasts shows a reduction in RMSE of about 60\% and 20\% for wind and solar respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络在异配图上表现不佳且容易过平滑，需要新的机制来增强表达能力。

Method: 引入复杂权重结构，将随机游走扩展到复数域，提出复杂权重卷积网络(CWCN)，直接从数据中学习合适的复杂权重结构。

Result: CWCN在基准数据集上取得了有竞争力的性能，无需额外超参数。

Conclusion: 复杂权重扩散为增强GNN表达能力提供了原则性和通用的机制。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse applications, yet they remain limited by oversmoothing and poor performance on heterophilic graphs. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework that equips graphs with a complex-weighted structure, assigning each edge a complex number to drive a diffusion process that extends random walks into the complex domain. We prove that this diffusion is highly expressive: with appropriately chosen complex weights, any node-classification task can be solved in the steady state of a complex random walk. Building on this insight, we propose the Complex-Weighted Convolutional Network (CWCN), which learns suitable complex-weighted structures directly from data while enriching diffusion with learnable matrices and nonlinear activations. CWCN is simple to implement, requires no additional hyperparameters beyond those of standard GNNs, and achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that complex-weighted diffusion provides a principled and general mechanism for enhancing GNN expressiveness, opening new avenues for models that are both theoretically grounded and practically effective.

TL;DR: 研究表明，随机森林中调整bootstrap rate(BR)超参数能显著提升性能，最佳BR值因数据集特性而异，与全局特征-目标关系强度和局部目标方差相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机森林通常使用BR=1.0的默认设置，但缺乏对BR值如何影响性能的系统研究，需要探索BR调优的潜力。

Method: 在39个异质回归数据集和16种RF配置上，系统测试BR从0.2到5.0的变化，使用重复二折交叉验证和均方误差评估性能。

Result: 调优BR能显著提升性能：24个数据集偏好BR≤1.0，15个偏好BR>1.0，仅4个数据集BR=1.0最优。数据集特征与BR偏好相关：全局特征-目标关系强的偏好高BR，局部目标方差高的偏好低BR。

Conclusion: BR是一个重要超参数，应通过调优来优化随机森林回归模型性能。

Abstract: Random Forests (RFs) typically train each tree on a bootstrap sample of the same size as the training set, i.e., bootstrap rate (BR) equals 1.0. We systematically examine how varying BR from 0.2 to 5.0 affects RF performance across 39 heterogeneous regression datasets and 16 RF configurations, evaluating with repeated two-fold cross-validation and mean squared error. Our results demonstrate that tuning the BR can yield significant improvements over the default: the best setup relied on BR \leq 1.0 for 24 datasets, BR > 1.0 for 15, and BR = 1.0 was optimal in 4 cases only. We establish a link between dataset characteristics and the preferred BR: datasets with strong global feature-target relationships favor higher BRs, while those with higher local target variance benefit from lower BRs. To further investigate this relationship, we conducted experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled noise levels. These experiments reproduce the observed bias-variance trade-off: in low-noise scenarios, higher BRs effectively reduce model bias, whereas in high-noise settings, lower BRs help reduce model variance. Overall, BR is an influential hyperparameter that should be tuned to optimize RF regression models.

TL;DR: PCA Whitening预处理技术能改善稀疏自编码器(SAE)的性能，通过使优化景观更凸化来提升可解释性指标，尽管重建质量略有下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏自编码器在神经网络激活特征学习中面临输入数据相关性导致的优化挑战，需要改进训练方法。

Method: 应用PCA Whitening预处理输入激活，评估ReLU和Top-K SAE在不同模型架构、宽度和稀疏度下的表现，使用SAEBench基准进行综合评估。

Result: 白化处理一致改善了可解释性指标（稀疏探测准确率和特征解缠），但重建质量略有下降，挑战了可解释性与最优稀疏度-保真度权衡的传统假设。

Conclusion: 白化应作为SAE训练的默认预处理步骤，特别是在优先考虑可解释性而非完美重建时。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising approach for learning interpretable features from neural network activations. However, the optimization landscape for SAE training can be challenging due to correlations in the input data. We demonstrate that applying PCA Whitening to input activations -- a standard preprocessing technique in classical sparse coding -- improves SAE performance across multiple metrics. Through theoretical analysis and simulation, we show that whitening transforms the optimization landscape, making it more convex and easier to navigate. We evaluate both ReLU and Top-K SAEs across diverse model architectures, widths, and sparsity regimes. Empirical evaluation on SAEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for sparse autoencoders, reveals that whitening consistently improves interpretability metrics, including sparse probing accuracy and feature disentanglement, despite minor drops in reconstruction quality. Our results challenge the assumption that interpretability aligns with an optimal sparsity--fidelity trade-off and suggest that whitening should be considered as a default preprocessing step for SAE training, particularly when interpretability is prioritized over perfect reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于token概率的方法无法准确检测LLM生成的SQL错误，需要更细粒度的、语义感知的错误检测方法。

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 语义感知标签算法为AST节点分配正确性标签；2) 使用模式感知和词汇特征训练监督分类器预测节点错误概率。

Result: 在多个数据库和数据集上，AUC平均提升27.44%，在跨数据库评估中保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 节点中心、语义基础的不确定性估计是聚合序列级置信度测量的强有力且可解释的替代方案。

Abstract: We present a practical framework for detecting errors in LLM-generated SQL by estimating uncertainty at the level of individual nodes in the query's abstract syntax tree (AST). Our approach proceeds in two stages. First, we introduce a semantically aware labeling algorithm that, given a generated SQL and a gold reference, assigns node-level correctness without over-penalizing structural containers or alias variation. Second, we represent each node with a rich set of schema-aware and lexical features - capturing identifier validity, alias resolution, type compatibility, ambiguity in scope, and typo signals - and train a supervised classifier to predict per-node error probabilities. We interpret these probabilities as calibrated uncertainty, enabling fine-grained diagnostics that pinpoint exactly where a query is likely to be wrong. Across multiple databases and datasets, our method substantially outperforms token log-probabilities: average AUC improves by +27.44% while maintaining robustness under cross-database evaluation. Beyond serving as an accuracy signal, node-level uncertainty supports targeted repair, human-in-the-loop review, and downstream selective execution. Together, these results establish node-centric, semantically grounded uncertainty estimation as a strong and interpretable alternative to aggregate sequence level confidence measures.

TL;DR: 本文研究了差分隐私下Lipschitz凸损失函数经验/总体风险最小化的运行时间下界，揭示了差分隐私优化器需要付出维度依赖的运行时间代价，并分析了梯度量化技术的基本限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究差分隐私优化算法的计算复杂性，特别是理解隐私保护对优化效率的影响，以及探索梯度压缩等技术的理论极限。

Method: 通过信息论方法建立下界，分析不同设置下的运行时间：非光滑损失与私有代理oracle、光滑损失仅要求优化器私有、以及信息受限oracle场景。

Result: 证明了多个紧下界：非光滑损失需要Ω(min{√d/α², d/log(1/α)})次oracle调用；光滑损失需要Ω̃(√d/α + min{1/α², n})次调用；信息受限oracle需要Ω(min{d/(α²Γ), d/log(1/α)})次调用。

Conclusion: 差分隐私优化器必须付出维度依赖的运行时间代价，梯度量化技术在优化中存在基本限制，这些结果为差分隐私优化的理论理解提供了重要贡献。

Abstract: We study the running time, in terms of first order oracle queries, of differentially private empirical/population risk minimization of Lipschitz convex losses. We first consider the setting where the loss is non-smooth and the optimizer interacts with a private proxy oracle, which sends only private messages about a minibatch of gradients. In this setting, we show that expected running time $Ω(\min\{\frac{\sqrt{d}}{α^2}, \frac{d}{\log(1/α)}\})$ is necessary to achieve $α$ excess risk on problems of dimension $d$ when $d \geq 1/α^2$. Upper bounds via DP-SGD show these results are tight when $d>\tildeΩ(1/α^4)$. We further show our lower bound can be strengthened to $Ω(\min\{\frac{d}{\bar{m}α^2}, \frac{d}{\log(1/α)} \})$ for algorithms which use minibatches of size at most $\bar{m} < \sqrt{d}$. We next consider smooth losses, where we relax the private oracle assumption and give lower bounds under only the condition that the optimizer is private. Here, we lower bound the expected number of first order oracle calls by $\tildeΩ\big(\frac{\sqrt{d}}α + \min\{\frac{1}{α^2}, n\}\big)$, where $n$ is the size of the dataset. Modifications to existing algorithms show this bound is nearly tight. Compared to non-private lower bounds, our results show that differentially private optimizers pay a dimension dependent runtime penalty. Finally, as a natural extension of our proof technique, we show lower bounds in the non-smooth setting for optimizers interacting with information limited oracles. Specifically, if the proxy oracle transmits at most $Γ$-bits of information about the gradients in the minibatch, then $Ω\big(\min\{\frac{d}{α^2Γ}, \frac{d}{\log(1/α)}\}\big)$ oracle calls are needed. This result shows fundamental limitations of gradient quantization techniques in optimization.

Conclusion: 概率电路为贝叶斯网络结构学习提供了一种有效的边缘化替代方案，能够改善学习性能。

Abstract: Bayesian networks (BNs) are a widely used class of probabilistic graphical models employed in numerous application domains. However, inferring the network's graphical structure from data remains challenging. Bayesian structure learners approach this problem by inferring a posterior distribution over the possible directed acyclic graphs underlying the BN. The inference process often requires marginalizing over probability distributions, which is typically done using dynamic programming methods that restrict the set of possible parents for each node. Instead, we present a novel method that utilizes tractable probabilistic circuits to circumvent this restriction. This method utilizes a new learning routine that trains these circuits on both the original distribution and marginal queries. The architecture of probabilistic circuits then inherently allows for fast and exact marginalization on the learned distribution. We then show empirically that utilizing our method to answer marginals allows Bayesian structure learners to improve their performance compared to current methods.

Abstract: Certified defenses promise provable robustness guarantees. We study the malicious exploitation of probabilistic certification frameworks to better understand the limits of guarantee provisions. Now, the objective is to not only mislead a classifier, but also manipulate the certification process to generate a robustness guarantee for an adversarial input certificate spoofing. A recent study in ICLR demonstrated that crafting large perturbations can shift inputs far into regions capable of generating a certificate for an incorrect class. Our study investigates if perturbations needed to cause a misclassification and yet coax a certified model into issuing a deceptive, large robustness radius for a target class can still be made small and imperceptible. We explore the idea of region-focused adversarial examples to craft imperceptible perturbations, spoof certificates and achieve certification radii larger than the source class ghost certificates. Extensive evaluations with the ImageNet demonstrate the ability to effectively bypass state-of-the-art certified defenses such as Densepure. Our work underscores the need to better understand the limits of robustness certification methods.

Motivation: 先前研究表明，对不安全代码数据进行微调会触发新兴错位现象，模型即使在与原始任务无关的提示下也会生成恶意响应。这种有害行为的跨域泛化需要深入理解引发新兴错位的算法、任务和数据集。本研究旨在探索拒绝遗忘是否也会导致类似的新兴错位现象。

Method: 在网络安全和安全概念上进行拒绝遗忘，通过监控七个负责任AI领域的拒绝分数来评估新兴错位。使用Mistral-7b-0.3v和Qwen-7b-2.5两个模型家族进行实验。采用交叉熵损失函数和受影响领域的小规模保留数据来恢复对齐。通过概念向量分析表示层的概念纠缠。

Result: 窄领域遗忘可以获得目标概念的合规响应，但会将新兴错位传播到无关领域。安全概念对其他领域（如偏见）的影响更大，在两个模型家族中一致观察到这种效应。使用交叉熵损失和保留数据可以大幅恢复受影响领域的对齐，同时保持目标概念的较低拒绝率。概念向量分析显示，早期层表示相似度高的概念在干预后更容易出现错位。

Conclusion: 窄领域拒绝遗忘虽然能提高目标概念的合规性，但可能引发跨域新兴错位。安全概念对其他领域的影响尤为显著。通过交叉熵损失和保留数据可以有效缓解这一问题。概念表示相似度是预测新兴错位易感性的重要指标，为理解和预防模型错位提供了新视角。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that fine-tuning on insecure code data can trigger an emergent misalignment (EMA) phenomenon, where models generate malicious responses even to prompts unrelated to the original insecure code-writing task. Such cross-domain generalization of harmful behavior underscores the need for a deeper understanding of the algorithms, tasks, and datasets that induce emergent misalignment. In this work, we extend this study by demonstrating that emergent misalignment can also arise from narrow refusal unlearning in specific domains. We perform refusal unlearning on Cybersecurity and Safety concept, and evaluate EMA by monitoring refusal scores across seven responsible AI (RAI) domains, Cybersecurity, Safety, Toxicity, Bias, Sensitive Content, Medical/Legal, and Privacy. Our work shows that narrow domain unlearning can yield compliance responses for the targeted concept, however, it may also propagate EMA to unrelated domains. Among the two intervened concepts, Cybersecurity and Safety, we find that the safety concept can have larger EMA impact, i.e, causing lower refusal scores, across other unrelated domains such as bias. We observe this effect consistently across two model families, Mistral-7b-0.3v, and Qwen-7b-2.5. Further, we show that refusal unlearning augmented with cross-entropy loss function on a small set of retain data from the affected domains can largely, if not fully, restore alignment across the impacted domains while having lower refusal rate on the concept we perform unlearning on. To investigate the underlying causes of EMA, we analyze concept entanglements at the representation level via concept vectors. Our analysis reveals that concepts with higher representation similarity in earlier layers are more susceptible to EMA after intervention when the refusal stream is altered through targeted refusal unlearning.

Motivation: 中小企业占美国企业的99.9%，但由于运营规模与现代机器学习的数据需求不匹配，它们被系统性地排除在AI应用之外。

Method: 采用三层架构：第一层从22,673条公共记录中提取信息先验；第二层在5-50个中小企业间实现分层池化；第三层提供具有有限样本覆盖保证的保形预测。

Result: 在客户流失数据验证中，每个企业使用100个观测数据达到96.7%±4.2%的AUC，比独立逻辑回归提高24.2个百分点，训练时间仅33分钟。

Conclusion: SmallML通过使3300万美国中小企业能够使用机器学习，解决了AI民主化中的关键差距。

Abstract: Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) represent 99.9% of U.S. businesses yet remain systematically excluded from AI due to a mismatch between their operational scale and modern machine learning's data requirements. This paper introduces SmallML, a Bayesian transfer learning framework achieving enterprise-level prediction accuracy with datasets as small as 50-200 observations.
  We develop a three-layer architecture integrating transfer learning, hierarchical Bayesian modeling, and conformal prediction. Layer 1 extracts informative priors from 22,673 public records using a SHAP-based procedure transferring knowledge from gradient boosting to logistic regression. Layer 2 implements hierarchical pooling across J=5-50 SMEs with adaptive shrinkage, balancing population patterns with entity-specific characteristics. Layer 3 provides conformal sets with finite-sample coverage guarantees P(y in C(x)) >= 1-alpha for distribution-free uncertainty quantification.
  Validation on customer churn data demonstrates 96.7% +/- 4.2% AUC with 100 observations per business -- a +24.2 point improvement over independent logistic regression (72.5% +/- 8.1%), with p < 0.000001. Conformal prediction achieves 92% empirical coverage at 90% target. Training completes in 33 minutes on standard CPU hardware. By enabling enterprise-grade predictions for 33 million U.S. SMEs previously excluded from machine learning, SmallML addresses a critical gap in AI democratization.

*Marios Papamichals,Regina Ruane*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Radial Compensation（RC）方法，通过选择切空间中的基础密度，使似然仅依赖于测地距离，从而解耦参数语义与曲率。该方法在流形生成模型中稳定训练，提高似然性并防止高维流中的半径爆炸。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流形生成模型中的指数映射和体积保持图都会将曲率与模型参数纠缠，导致梯度方差增大。在高维潜在归一化流中，包裹指数先验会使半径拉伸超出曲率尺度，导致测试似然性差和求解器僵硬。

Method: 引入径向补偿（RC）方法，选择切空间中的基础密度，使似然仅依赖于测地距离。扩展RC到已知测地极体积的流形，推导平衡指数（bExp）图族，平衡体积失真和测地误差。

Result: RC在所有bExp设置下保持相同的流形密度和Fisher信息，较小值减少梯度方差和流成本。在图像、图、蛋白质模型的密度、VAE和流上，RC产生稳定的生成模型，提高似然性，恢复干净的测地半径，防止高维流中的半径爆炸。

Conclusion: RC-bExp成为流形上似然训练生成模型的鲁棒默认选择，通过解耦曲率与参数语义，实现稳定的训练和改善的性能。

Abstract: Generative models on curved spaces rely on charts to map Euclidean spaces to manifolds. Exponential maps preserve geodesics but have stiff, radius-dependent Jacobians, while volume-preserving charts maintain densities but distort geodesic distances. Both approaches entangle curvature with model parameters, inflating gradient variance. In high-dimensional latent normalizing flows, the wrapped exponential prior can stretch radii far beyond the curvature scale, leading to poor test likelihoods and stiff solvers. We introduce Radial Compensation (RC), an information-geometric method that selects the base density in the tangent space so that the likelihood depends only on geodesic distance from a pole, decoupling parameter semantics from curvature. RC lets radial parameters retain their usual meaning in geodesic units, while the chart can be tuned as a numerical preconditioner. We extend RC to manifolds with known geodesic polar volume and show that RC is the only construction for geodesic-radial likelihoods with curvature-invariant Fisher information. We derive the Balanced-Exponential (bExp) chart family, balancing volume distortion and geodesic error. Under RC, all bExp settings preserve the same manifold density and Fisher information, with smaller dial values reducing gradient variance and flow cost. Empirically, RC yields stable generative models across densities, VAEs, flows on images and graphs, and protein models. RC improves likelihoods, restores clean geodesic radii, and prevents radius blow-ups in high-dimensional flows, making RC-bExp a robust default for likelihood-trained generative models on manifolds.

Abstract: In precision sports such as archery, athletes' performance depends on both biomechanical stability and psychological resilience. Traditional motion analysis systems are often expensive and intrusive, limiting their use in natural training environments. To address this limitation, we propose a machine learning-based multimodal framework that integrates wearable sensor data for simultaneous action recognition and stress estimation. Using a self-developed wrist-worn device equipped with an accelerometer and photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor, we collected synchronized motion and physiological data during real archery sessions. For motion recognition, we introduce a novel feature--Smoothed Differential Acceleration (SmoothDiff)--and employ a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to identify motion phases, achieving 96.8% accuracy and 95.9% F1-score. For stress estimation, we extract heart rate variability (HRV) features from PPG signals and apply a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, achieving 80% accuracy in distinguishing high- and low-stress levels. The proposed framework demonstrates that integrating motion and physiological sensing can provide meaningful insights into athletes' technical and mental states. This approach offers a foundation for developing intelligent, real-time feedback systems for training optimization in archery and other precision sports.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CafeMed是一个结合动态因果推理和跨模态注意力的药物推荐框架，通过动态因果权重生成器和通道协调注意力细化模块，解决了现有方法忽视医疗实体协同效应和静态因果关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有药物推荐系统存在两个基本限制：(i) 将医疗实体视为独立特征，未建模它们对药物选择的协同效应；(ii) 使用静态因果关系，无法适应患者特定情境和健康状态。

Method: CafeMed框架包含两个关键组件：因果权重生成器(CWG)将静态因果效应转换为基于个体患者状态的动态调制权重；通道协调注意力细化模块(CHARM)捕捉诊断和程序之间的复杂相互依赖关系。

Result: 在MIMIC-III和MIMIC-IV数据集上的广泛实验表明，CafeMed显著优于最先进的基线方法，在药物预测准确性方面表现优异，同时保持较低的药物-药物相互作用率。

Conclusion: 结合动态因果关系和跨模态协同效应能够产生更符合临床实践和个性化的药物推荐，CafeMed框架为安全准确的药物推荐提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Medication recommendation systems play a crucial role in assisting clinicians with personalized treatment decisions. While existing approaches have made significant progress in learning medication representations, they suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) treating medical entities as independent features without modeling their synergistic effects on medication selection; (ii) employing static causal relationships that fail to adapt to patient-specific contexts and health states. To address these challenges, we propose CafeMed, a framework that integrates dynamic causal reasoning with cross-modal attention for safe and accurate medication recommendation. CafeMed introduces two key components: the Causal Weight Generator (CWG) that transforms static causal effects into dynamic modulation weights based on individual patient states, and the Channel Harmonized Attention Refinement Module (CHARM) that captures complex interdependencies between diagnoses and procedures. This design enables CafeMed to model how different medical conditions jointly influence treatment decisions while maintaining medication safety constraints. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that CafeMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior accuracy in medication prediction while maintaining the lower drug--drug interaction rates. Our results indicate that incorporating dynamic causal relationships and cross-modal synergies leads to more clinically-aligned and personalized medication recommendations. Our code is released publicly at https://github.com/rkl71/CafeMed.

TL;DR: 提出CFG-EC方法，通过修正无条件噪声预测来减少CFG训练与采样过程中的不一致性，提高条件生成模型的提示保真度和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFG在训练时随机切换条件和空提示，但在采样时同时输出两者，导致训练与采样过程的噪声估计不一致，产生误差。

Method: CFG-EC通过主动调整无条件噪声误差分量，使其与条件误差分量正交，防止两个引导分量相互干扰，从而约束采样误差上限。

Result: 数值实验显示CFG-EC比CFG和CFG++更有效地处理无条件分量，在低引导采样情况下性能显著提升，整体提示对齐度更高。

Conclusion: CFG-EC是一种可增强任何基于CFG方法的通用校正方案，通过更可靠的引导轨迹实现高保真图像生成。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has become a mainstream approach for simultaneously improving prompt fidelity and generation quality in conditional generative models. During training, CFG stochastically alternates between conditional and null prompts to enable both conditional and unconditional generation. However, during sampling, CFG outputs both null and conditional prompts simultaneously, leading to inconsistent noise estimates between the training and sampling processes. To reduce this error, we propose CFG-EC, a versatile correction scheme augmentable to any CFG-based method by refining the unconditional noise predictions. CFG-EC actively realigns the unconditional noise error component to be orthogonal to the conditional error component. This corrective maneuver prevents interference between the two guidance components, thereby constraining the sampling error's upper bound and establishing more reliable guidance trajectories for high-fidelity image generation. Our numerical experiments show that CFG-EC handles the unconditional component more effectively than CFG and CFG++, delivering a marked performance increase in the low guidance sampling regime and consistently higher prompt alignment across the board.

Method: 1. 细粒度CSI图构建：将每个AP作为图节点，适应AP数量变化；2. 幅度-相位融合方法和特征提取方法：构建CSI图像并提取维度一致特征；3. 相似性引导元学习策略：通过比较新场景与历史场景的相似度确定微调参数。

Conclusion: Meta-SimGNN通过集成图神经网络和元学习，有效提高了WiFi定位系统对设备配置变化的适应能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: To promote the practicality of deep learning-based localization, existing studies aim to address the issue of scenario dependence through meta-learning. However, these studies primarily focus on variations in environmental layouts while overlooking the impact of changes in device configurations, such as bandwidth, the number of access points (APs), and the number of antennas used. Unlike environmental changes, variations in device configurations affect the dimensionality of channel state information (CSI), thereby compromising neural network usability. To address this issue, we propose Meta-SimGNN, a novel WiFi localization system that integrates graph neural networks with meta-learning to improve localization generalization and robustness. First, we introduce a fine-grained CSI graph construction scheme, where each AP is treated as a graph node, allowing for adaptability to changes in the number of APs. To structure the features of each node, we propose an amplitude-phase fusion method and a feature extraction method. The former utilizes both amplitude and phase to construct CSI images, enhancing data reliability, while the latter extracts dimension-consistent features to address variations in bandwidth and the number of antennas. Second, a similarity-guided meta-learning strategy is developed to enhance adaptability in diverse scenarios. The initial model parameters for the fine-tuning stage are determined by comparing the similarity between the new scenario and historical scenarios, facilitating rapid adaptation of the model to the new localization scenario. Extensive experimental results over commodity WiFi devices in different scenarios show that Meta-SimGNN outperforms the baseline methods in terms of localization generalization and accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有差分隐私审计方法需要修改训练数据集（如注入异常样本或移除样本），这在大型系统中资源密集且工程开销大，因此需要一种无需干预数据管道的审计方法。

Method: 开发了基于数据分布固有随机性的观察式审计框架，将隐私审计从传统的成员推断扩展到受保护属性（特别是标签）的隐私评估。

Conclusion: 这项工作为大规模生产环境中的实用隐私审计开辟了新途径，提供了一种无需修改原始数据集的轻量级审计解决方案。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) auditing is essential for evaluating privacy guarantees in machine learning systems. Existing auditing methods, however, pose a significant challenge for large-scale systems since they require modifying the training dataset -- for instance, by injecting out-of-distribution canaries or removing samples from training. Such interventions on the training data pipeline are resource-intensive and involve considerable engineering overhead. We introduce a novel observational auditing framework that leverages the inherent randomness of data distributions, enabling privacy evaluation without altering the original dataset. Our approach extends privacy auditing beyond traditional membership inference to protected attributes, with labels as a special case, addressing a key gap in existing techniques. We provide theoretical foundations for our method and perform experiments on Criteo and CIFAR-10 datasets that demonstrate its effectiveness in auditing label privacy guarantees. This work opens new avenues for practical privacy auditing in large-scale production environments.

Conclusion: 为资源受限环境中管理数据依赖性内存访问提供了一种新的原则性方法，使MoE推理在商用硬件上更加可行。

Abstract: The immense memory requirements of state-of-the-art Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models present a significant challenge for inference, often exceeding the capacity of a single accelerator. While offloading experts to host memory is a common solution, it introduces a severe I/O bottleneck over the PCIe bus, as the data-dependent nature of expert selection places these synchronous transfers directly on the critical path of execution, crippling performance.
  This paper argues that the I/O bottleneck can be overcome by trading a small amount of cheap, on-device computation to hide the immense cost of data movement. We present MoE-SpeQ, a new inference system built on a novel co-design of speculative execution and expert offloading. MoE-SpeQ employs a small, on-device draft model to predict the sequence of required experts for future tokens. This foresight enables a runtime orchestrator to prefetch these experts from host memory, effectively overlapping the expensive I/O with useful computation and hiding the latency from the critical path. To maximize performance, an adaptive governor, guided by an Amortization Roofline Model, dynamically tunes the speculation strategy to the underlying hardware. Our evaluation on memory-constrained devices shows that for the Phi-MoE model, MoE-SpeQ achieves at most 2.34x speedup over the state-of-the-art offloading framework. Our work establishes a new, principled approach for managing data-dependent memory access in resource-limited environments, making MoE inference more accessible on commodity hardware.

TL;DR: 该论文主张在主观性机器学习任务中，应将标注分布视为真实标签而非聚合为单一标签，通过软标签训练保留认知不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准做法将多样的标注分布聚合为单一标签，这在模糊数据上存在认知偏差，迫使模型在本质上模糊的情况下表达虚假置信度。

Method: 采用软标签训练方法，将标注分布作为真实标签进行训练，而非使用聚合后的硬标签。

Result: 在视觉和NLP任务中，软标签训练相比硬标签训练实现了32%更低的KL散度和61%更强的模型与标注熵相关性，同时保持相同的准确率。

Conclusion: 标注分布不应被视为需要聚合的噪声信号，而应作为认知不确定性的忠实表示，模型应学习重现这种不确定性。

Abstract: Many machine learning tasks involve inherent subjectivity, where annotators naturally provide varied labels. Standard practice collapses these label distributions into single labels, aggregating diverse human judgments into point estimates. We argue that this approach is epistemically misaligned for ambiguous data--the annotation distribution itself should be regarded as the ground truth. Training on collapsed single labels forces models to express false confidence on fundamentally ambiguous cases, creating a misalignment between model certainty and the diversity of human perception. We demonstrate empirically that soft-label training, which treats annotation distributions as ground truth, preserves epistemic uncertainty. Across both vision and NLP tasks, soft-label training achieves 32% lower KL divergence from human annotations and 61% stronger correlation between model and annotation entropy, while matching the accuracy of hard-label training. Our work repositions annotation distributions from noisy signals to be aggregated away, to faithful representations of epistemic uncertainty that models should learn to reproduce.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察性数据中估计时间到事件结果的因果效应面临删失、样本量有限和非随机治疗分配等挑战，需要回答"如果-何时"问题。

Method: SSC通过将目标单位的反事实风险轨迹表示为其他单位观察轨迹的加权组合来估计，引入具有低秩结构的面板框架进行因果生存分析。

Result: 在癌症治疗多国临床数据集中验证，发现新型治疗与改善生存相关，干预后风险轨迹相对于合成对应物更低。

Conclusion: 该框架为使用观察性数据进行反事实生存推断提供了一个通用且可解释的工具，在医学、经济学和公共政策中具有广泛应用价值。

Abstract: Estimating causal effects on time-to-event outcomes from observational data is particularly challenging due to censoring, limited sample sizes, and non-random treatment assignment. The need for answering such "when-if" questions--how the timing of an event would change under a specified intervention--commonly arises in real-world settings with heterogeneous treatment adoption and confounding. To address these challenges, we propose Synthetic Survival Control (SSC) to estimate counterfactual hazard trajectories in a panel data setting where multiple units experience potentially different treatments over multiple periods. In such a setting, SSC estimates the counterfactual hazard trajectory for a unit of interest as a weighted combination of the observed trajectories from other units. To provide formal justification, we introduce a panel framework with a low-rank structure for causal survival analysis. Indeed, such a structure naturally arises under classical parametric survival models. Within this framework, for the causal estimand of interest, we establish identification and finite sample guarantees for SSC. We validate our approach using a multi-country clinical dataset of cancer treatment outcomes, where the staggered introduction of new therapies creates a quasi-experimental setting. Empirically, we find that access to novel treatments is associated with improved survival, as reflected by lower post-intervention hazard trajectories relative to their synthetic counterparts. Given the broad relevance of survival analysis across medicine, economics, and public policy, our framework offers a general and interpretable tool for counterfactual survival inference using observational data.

Motivation: 现有MARL方法通过事后编排来塑造奖励以实现公平，但缺乏运行时不可变的可证明自执行公平性。在共享资源的医疗工作者环境中，需要确保公平的工作负载分配以获得一致可靠的性能

Method: 将MARL建模为约束广义纳什均衡寻求游戏，通过自适应约束执行引导群体策略达到安全且局部有效的均衡状态，使任何智能体都无法通过单方面改变决策来提高效用函数

Result: 在定制的高保真复苏模拟器中，Fair-GNE相比固定惩罚基线显著改善了工作负载平衡（0.89 vs 0.33 JFI，p < 0.01），同时保持了86%的任务成功率

Conclusion: Fair-GNE通过在大规模多智能体学习型医疗系统中提供清晰的公式、评估指标和均衡寻求创新，实现了有原则的公平执行

Abstract: Enforcing a fair workload allocation among multiple agents tasked to achieve an objective in learning enabled demand side healthcare worker settings is crucial for consistent and reliable performance at runtime. Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches steer fairness by shaping reward through post hoc orchestrations, leaving no certifiable self-enforceable fairness that is immutable by individual agents at runtime. Contextualized within a setting where each agent shares resources with others, we address this shortcoming with a learning enabled optimization scheme among self-interested decision makers whose individual actions affect those of other agents. This extends the problem to a generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) game-theoretic framework where we steer group policy to a safe and locally efficient equilibrium, so that no agent can improve its utility function by unilaterally changing its decisions. Fair-GNE models MARL as a constrained generalized Nash equilibrium-seeking (GNE) game, prescribing an ideal equitable collective equilibrium within the problem's natural fabric. Our hypothesis is rigorously evaluated in our custom-designed high-fidelity resuscitation simulator. Across all our numerical experiments, Fair-GNE achieves significant improvement in workload balance over fixed-penalty baselines (0.89 vs.\ 0.33 JFI, $p < 0.01$) while maintaining 86\% task success, demonstrating statistically significant fairness gains through adaptive constraint enforcement. Our results communicate our formulations, evaluation metrics, and equilibrium-seeking innovations in large multi-agent learning-based healthcare systems with clarity and principled fairness enforcement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inherit explicit and implicit biases from their training datasets. Identifying and mitigating biases in LLMs is crucial to ensure fair outputs, as they can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and misinformation. This study highlights the need to address biases in LLMs amid growing generative AI. We studied bias-specific benchmarks such as StereoSet and CrowSPairs to evaluate the existence of various biases in multiple generative models such as BERT and GPT 3.5. We proposed an automated Bias-Identification Framework to recognize various social biases in LLMs such as gender, race, profession, and religion. We adopted a two-pronged approach to detect explicit and implicit biases in text data. Results indicated fine-tuned models struggle with gender biases but excelled at identifying and avoiding racial biases. Our findings illustrated that despite having some success, LLMs often over-relied on keywords. To illuminate the capability of the analyzed LLMs in detecting implicit biases, we employed Bag-of-Words analysis and unveiled indications of implicit stereotyping within the vocabulary. To bolster the model performance, we applied an enhancement strategy involving fine-tuning models using prompting techniques and data augmentation of the bias benchmarks. The fine-tuned models exhibited promising adaptability during cross-dataset testing and significantly enhanced performance on implicit bias benchmarks, with performance gains of up to 20%.

Conclusion: CSGU为符号图神经网络提供了可证明的隐私保证，同时保持了SGNNs的社会学原则，在隐私保护和模型效用之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Signed graphs model complex relationships through positive and negative edges, with widespread real-world applications. Given the sensitive nature of such data, selective removal mechanisms have become essential for privacy protection. While graph unlearning enables the removal of specific data influences from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), existing methods are designed for conventional GNNs and overlook the unique heterogeneous properties of signed graphs. When applied to Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs), these methods lose critical sign information, degrading both model utility and unlearning effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose Certified Signed Graph Unlearning (CSGU), which provides provable privacy guarantees while preserving the sociological principles underlying SGNNs. CSGU employs a three-stage method: (1) efficiently identifying minimal influenced neighborhoods via triangular structures, (2) applying sociological theories to quantify node importance for optimal privacy budget allocation, and (3) performing importance-weighted parameter updates to achieve certified modifications with minimal utility degradation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CSGU outperforms existing methods, achieving superior performance in both utility preservation and unlearning effectiveness on SGNNs.

Method: 基于模型潜在表示，分析APT（角度-概率轨迹）并引入JSS（Jensen-Shannon可分离性）指标，完全绕过文本生成。

Result: 在40多个模型和20种红队策略上的实验表明，JSS指标与红队测试的安全排名高度一致，仅用不到1%的token和运行时成本重现了大规模测试的判别趋势。

Conclusion: N-GLARE为实时诊断提供了一个高效的无输出评估代理，显著提升了LLM安全性评估的效率。

Abstract: Evaluating the safety robustness of LLMs is critical for their deployment. However, mainstream Red Teaming methods rely on online generation and black-box output analysis. These approaches are not only costly but also suffer from feedback latency, making them unsuitable for agile diagnostics after training a new model. To address this, we propose N-GLARE (A Non-Generative, Latent Representation-Efficient LLM Safety Evaluator). N-GLARE operates entirely on the model's latent representations, bypassing the need for full text generation. It characterizes hidden layer dynamics by analyzing the APT (Angular-Probabilistic Trajectory) of latent representations and introducing the JSS (Jensen-Shannon Separability) metric. Experiments on over 40 models and 20 red teaming strategies demonstrate that the JSS metric exhibits high consistency with the safety rankings derived from Red Teaming. N-GLARE reproduces the discriminative trends of large-scale red-teaming tests at less than 1\% of the token cost and the runtime cost, providing an efficient output-free evaluation proxy for real-time diagnostics.

Abstract: Weather forecasting is fundamentally challenged by the chaotic nature of the atmosphere, necessitating probabilistic approaches to quantify uncertainty. While traditional ensemble prediction (EPS) addresses this through computationally intensive simulations, recent advances in Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL) offer a promising but often disconnected alternative. We bridge these paradigms through a unified hybrid Bayesian Deep Learning framework for ensemble weather forecasting that explicitly decomposes predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components, learned via variational inference and a physics-informed stochastic perturbation scheme modeling flow-dependent atmospheric dynamics, respectively. We further establish a unified theoretical framework that rigorously connects BDL and EPS, providing formal theorems that decompose total predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components under the hybrid BDL framework. We validate our framework on the large-scale 40-year ERA5 reanalysis dataset (1979-2019) with 0.25° spatial resolution. Experimental results show that our method not only improves forecast accuracy and yields better-calibrated uncertainty quantification but also achieves superior computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art probabilistic diffusion models. We commit to making our code open-source upon acceptance of this paper.

Motivation: 基于模型的强化学习方法中，SMC虽然比MCTS更容易并行化和GPU加速，但存在方差大和路径退化问题，限制了搜索深度的扩展。

Method: 提出了TSMCTS算法，通过两次顺序蒙特卡洛树搜索来减少方差和缓解路径退化问题。

Result: 在离散和连续环境中，TSMCTS优于SMC基线和现代MCTS版本，能够更好地扩展序列计算能力。

Conclusion: TSMCTS通过改进SMC的缺陷，在保持并行化优势的同时实现了更好的搜索深度扩展性。

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods that leverage search are responsible for many milestone breakthroughs in RL. Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) recently emerged as an alternative to the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm which drove these breakthroughs. SMC is easier to parallelize and more suitable to GPU acceleration. However, it also suffers from large variance and path degeneracy which prevent it from scaling well with increased search depth, i.e., increased sequential compute. To address these problems, we introduce Twice Sequential Monte Carlo Tree Search (TSMCTS). Across discrete and continuous environments TSMCTS outperforms the SMC baseline as well as a popular modern version of MCTS. Through variance reduction and mitigation of path degeneracy, TSMCTS scales favorably with sequential compute while retaining the properties that make SMC natural to parallelize.

*Jim Broadbent,Felix Cohen,Frederik Hvilshøj,Eric Landau,Eren Sasoglu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EBind是一种简单、数据驱动且参数高效的方法，用于绑定多模态对比模型的嵌入空间，仅需单个GPU在几小时内即可训练出最先进模型，性能优于参数大4-17倍的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 简化空间绑定过程，通过专注于单一编码器和高质量数据，实现在有限计算资源下训练高性能多模态模型。

Method: 使用精心策划的三类互补数据源：670万全自动多模态五元组、100万人工标注的多样化三元组、340万现有标注数据项，构建1.8B参数的图像-文本-视频-音频-3D模型。

Conclusion: EBind证明了通过精心设计的数据集和参数高效方法，可以在有限计算资源下实现多模态模型的卓越性能，并将开源代码、模型权重和数据集。

Abstract: We simplify space binding by focusing on two core components, a single encoder per modality and high-quality data; enabling training state-of-the-art models on a single GPU in a few hours as opposed to multiple days. We present EBind, an Easy, data-centric, and parameter-efficient method to Bind the embedding spaces of multiple contrastive models. We demonstrate that a simple 1.8B-parameter image-text-video-audio-3D model can outperform models 4 to 17x the size. The key to achieving this is a carefully curated dataset of three complementary data sources: i) 6.7M fully-automated multimodal quintuples sourced via SOTA retrieval models, ii) 1M diverse, semi-automated triples annotated by humans as negative, partial, or positive matches, and iii) 3.4M pre-existing captioned data items. We use 13 different evaluations to demonstrate the value of each data source. Due to limitations with existing benchmarks, we further introduce the first high-quality, consensus-annotated zero-shot classification benchmark between audio and PCs. In contrast to related work, we will open-source our code, model weights, and datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有世界模型难以准确模拟高维、非平稳、多对象交互的复杂环境，而人类通过分解环境为离散对象来高效决策。

Method: 使用对象为中心的Transformer表示观察结果，预测token级动态和交互；策略和价值网络估计token级因果关系并用于注意力层。

Result: 在对象丰富的基准测试中，STICA在样本效率和最终性能上都优于最先进的智能体。

Conclusion: 对象分解和因果感知的结合为复杂环境中的强化学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: World models have been developed to support sample-efficient deep reinforcement learning agents. However, it remains challenging for world models to accurately replicate environments that are high-dimensional, non-stationary, and composed of multiple objects with rich interactions since most world models learn holistic representations of all environmental components. By contrast, humans perceive the environment by decomposing it into discrete objects, facilitating efficient decision-making. Motivated by this insight, we propose \emph{Slot Transformer Imagination with CAusality-aware reinforcement learning} (STICA), a unified framework in which object-centric Transformers serve as the world model and causality-aware policy and value networks. STICA represents each observation as a set of object-centric tokens, together with tokens for the agent action and the resulting reward, enabling the world model to predict token-level dynamics and interactions. The policy and value networks then estimate token-level cause--effect relations and use them in the attention layers, yielding causality-guided decision-making. Experiments on object-rich benchmarks demonstrate that STICA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art agents in both sample efficiency and final performance.

Abstract: Recent work in deep learning has opened new possibilities for solving classical algorithmic tasks using end-to-end learned models. In this work, we investigate the fundamental task of solving linear systems, particularly those that are ill-conditioned. Existing numerical methods for ill-conditioned systems often require careful parameter tuning, preconditioning, or domain-specific expertise to ensure accuracy and stability. In this work, we propose Algebraformer, a Transformer-based architecture that learns to solve linear systems end-to-end, even in the presence of severe ill-conditioning. Our model leverages a novel encoding scheme that enables efficient representation of matrix and vector inputs, with a memory complexity of $O(n^2)$, supporting scalable inference. We demonstrate its effectiveness on application-driven linear problems, including interpolation tasks from spectral methods for boundary value problems and acceleration of the Newton method. Algebraformer achieves competitive accuracy with significantly lower computational overhead at test time, demonstrating that general-purpose neural architectures can effectively reduce complexity in traditional scientific computing pipelines.

Abstract: Vessel trajectory prediction is fundamental to intelligent maritime systems. Within this domain, short-term prediction of rapid behavioral changes in complex maritime environments has established multimodal trajectory prediction (MTP) as a promising research area. However, existing vessel MTP methods suffer from limited scenario applicability and insufficient explainability. To address these challenges, we propose a unified MTP framework incorporating explainable navigation intentions, which we classify into sustained and transient categories. Our method constructs sustained intention trees from historical trajectories and models dynamic transient intentions using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), while using a non-local attention mechanism to maintain global scenario consistency. Experiments on real Automatic Identification System (AIS) datasets demonstrates our method's broad applicability across diverse scenarios, achieving significant improvements in both ADE and FDE. Furthermore, our method improves explainability by explicitly revealing the navigational intentions underlying each predicted trajectory.

Abstract: Recent foundation models for tabular data achieve strong task-specific performance via in-context learning. Nevertheless, they focus on direct prediction by encapsulating both representation learning and task-specific inference inside a single, resource-intensive network. This work specifically focuses on representation learning, i.e., on transferable, task-agnostic embeddings. We systematically evaluate task-agnostic representations from tabular foundation models (TabPFN and TabICL) alongside with classical feature engineering (TableVectorizer) across a variety of application tasks as outlier detection (ADBench) and supervised learning (TabArena Lite). We find that simple TableVectorizer features achieve comparable or superior performance while being up to three orders of magnitude faster than tabular foundation models.

Result: 理论分析证明了VAR的收敛性，大量实验结果表明VAR在剪枝鲁棒性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: VAR通过增加参数方差有效提升了模型的剪枝鲁棒性，且计算开销低于现有方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve outstanding performance in visual recognition tasks, yet their large number of parameters makes them less practical for real-world applications. Recently, one-shot pruning has emerged as an effective strategy for reducing model size without additional training. However, models trained with standard objective functions often suffer a significant drop in accuracy after aggressive pruning. Some existing pruning-robust optimizers, such as SAM, and CrAM, mitigate this accuracy drop by guiding the model toward flatter regions of the parameter space, but they inevitably incur non-negligible additional computations. We propose a Variance Amplifying Regularizer (VAR) that deliberately increases the variance of model parameters during training. Our study reveals an intriguing finding that parameters with higher variance exhibit greater pruning robustness. VAR exploits this property by promoting such variance in the weight distribution, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of pruning. We further provide a theoretical analysis of its convergence behavior, supported by extensive empirical results demonstrating the superior pruning robustness of VAR.

To bridge this, we introduce H-LDM, a Hierarchical Latent Diffusion Model for generating clinically accurate and controllable PCG signals from structured metadata.

TL;DR: 提出两种工具（干预效率和扰动验证框架）来解决临床机器学习中的Rashomon效应问题，帮助选择更稳健且符合临床实用性的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床机器学习中存在多个性能相当的模型（Rashomon效应），加上小样本、不平衡、噪声数据以及高维弱识别特征，使传统验证方法不可靠，模型选择变得不确定。

Method: 提出干预效率（IE）和扰动验证框架（PVF）。IE是容量感知指标，量化模型在有限干预资源下识别可操作真阳性的效率；PVF评估模型在数据扰动下的稳定性。

Result: 在合成和真实医疗数据集上的实证结果表明，使用这些工具可以选出更稳健泛化且符合容量约束的模型。

Conclusion: 这些工具为解决临床环境中的Rashomon效应提供了新方向，将预测性能与临床效用联系起来。

Abstract: In clinical machine learning, the coexistence of multiple models with comparable performance -- a manifestation of the Rashomon Effect -- poses fundamental challenges for trustworthy deployment and evaluation. Small, imbalanced, and noisy datasets, coupled with high-dimensional and weakly identified clinical features, amplify this multiplicity and make conventional validation schemes unreliable. As a result, selecting among equally performing models becomes uncertain, particularly when resource constraints and operational priorities are not considered by conventional metrics like F1 score. To address these issues, we propose two complementary tools for robust model assessment and selection: Intervention Efficiency (IE) and the Perturbation Validation Framework (PVF). IE is a capacity-aware metric that quantifies how efficiently a model identifies actionable true positives when only limited interventions are feasible, thereby linking predictive performance with clinical utility. PVF introduces a structured approach to assess the stability of models under data perturbations, identifying models whose performance remains most invariant across noisy or shifted validation sets. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world healthcare datasets show that using these tools facilitates the selection of models that generalize more robustly and align with capacity constraints, offering a new direction for tackling the Rashomon Effect in clinical settings.

Conclusion: 该工作为处理等式约束的机器学习问题提供了理论保证和实用算法，扩展了约束优化在复杂学习任务中的应用范围。

Abstract: As machine learning applications grow increasingly ubiquitous and complex, they face an increasing set of requirements beyond accuracy. The prevalent approach to handle this challenge is to aggregate a weighted combination of requirement violation penalties into the training objective. To be effective, this approach requires careful tuning of these hyperparameters (weights), involving trial-and-error and cross-validation, which becomes ineffective even for a moderate number of requirements. These issues are exacerbated when the requirements involve parities or equalities, as is the case in fairness and boundary value problems. An alternative technique uses constrained optimization to formulate these learning problems. Yet, existing approximation and generalization guarantees do not apply to problems involving equality constraints. In this work, we derive a generalization theory for equality-constrained statistical learning problems, showing that their solutions can be approximated using samples and rich parametrizations. Using these results, we propose a practical algorithm based on solving a sequence of unconstrained, empirical learning problems. We showcase its effectiveness and the new formulations enabled by equality constraints in fair learning, interpolating classifiers, and boundary value problems.

Motivation: 传统PINNs在训练过程中经常忽略热力学第二定律所隐含的隐藏不可逆性，导致非物理解甚至训练失败。

Method: 引入不可逆性正则化策略，将隐藏物理定律作为软约束集成到PINNs训练过程中。

Result: 在多种基准测试中，该正则化方案将预测误差降低了一个数量级以上，且仅需对现有PINN框架进行最小修改。

Conclusion: 该框架适用于广泛的PDE控制物理系统，将在科学机器学习社区产生重要影响。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a new paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by integrating physical laws into the learning process of neural networks. However, despite their foundational role, the hidden irreversibility implied by the Second Law of Thermodynamics is often neglected during training, leading to unphysical solutions or even training failures in conventional PINNs. In this paper, we identify this critical gap and introduce a simple, generalized, yet robust irreversibility-regularized strategy that enforces hidden physical laws as soft constraints during training. This approach ensures that the learned solutions consistently respect the intrinsic one-way nature of irreversible physical processes. Across a wide range of benchmarks spanning traveling wave propagation, steady combustion, ice melting, corrosion evolution, and crack propagation, we demonstrate that our regularization scheme reduces predictive errors by more than an order of magnitude, while requiring only minimal modification to existing PINN frameworks. We believe that the proposed framework is broadly applicable to a wide class of PDE-governed physical systems and will have significant impact within the scientific machine learning community.

Abstract: Large models adaptation through Federated Learning (FL) addresses a wide range of use cases and is enabled by Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). However, this distributed learning paradigm faces several security threats, particularly to its integrity, such as backdoor attacks that aim to inject malicious behavior during the local training steps of certain clients. We present the first analysis of the influence of LoRA on state-of-the-art backdoor attacks targeting model adaptation in FL. Specifically, we focus on backdoor lifespan, a critical characteristic in FL, that can vary depending on the attack scenario and the attacker's ability to effectively inject the backdoor. A key finding in our experiments is that for an optimally injected backdoor, the backdoor persistence after the attack is longer when the LoRA's rank is lower. Importantly, our work highlights evaluation issues of backdoor attacks against FL and contributes to the development of more robust and fair evaluations of backdoor attacks, enhancing the reliability of risk assessments for critical FL systems. Our code is publicly available.

Abstract: Recently, the general-to-customized paradigm has emerged as the dominant approach for Cross-Modal Retrieval (CMR), which reconciles the distribution shift problem between the source domain and the target domain. However, existing general-to-customized CMR methods typically assume that the entire target-domain data is available, which is easily violated in real-world scenarios and thus inevitably suffer from the query shift (QS) problem. Specifically, query shift embraces the following two characteristics and thus poses new challenges to CMR. i) Online Shift: real-world queries always arrive in an online manner, rendering it impractical to access the entire query set beforehand for customization approaches; ii) Diverse Shift: even with domain customization, the CMR models struggle to satisfy queries from diverse users or scenarios, leaving an urgent need to accommodate diverse queries. In this paper, we observe that QS would not only undermine the well-structured common space inherited from the source model, but also steer the model toward forgetting the indispensable general knowledge for CMR. Inspired by the observations, we propose a novel method for achieving online and harmonious adaptation against QS, dubbed Robust adaptation with quEry ShifT (REST). To deal with online shift, REST first refines the retrieval results to formulate the query predictions and accordingly designs a QS-robust objective function on these predictions to preserve the well-established common space in an online manner. As for tackling the more challenging diverse shift, REST employs a gradient decoupling module to dexterously manipulate the gradients during the adaptation process, thus preventing the CMR model from forgetting the general knowledge. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmarks across three CMR tasks verify the effectiveness of our method against QS.

Motivation: ComplexEye等高通量成像平台产生指数级增长的数据，给存储和传输带来巨大负担，需要高效的图像压缩解决方案。

Method: FlowRoI通过估计连续帧之间的光流来推导RoI掩码，覆盖几乎所有迁移细胞，然后将原始图像和RoI掩码联合使用JPEG2000进行编码，实现RoI感知压缩。

Result: FlowRoI计算效率高，在现代笔记本电脑上达到约30帧/秒的吞吐量；在图像质量方面，在细胞区域获得更高的PSNR，在相同PSNR下比标准JPEG2000实现2.0-2.2倍更高的压缩率。

Conclusion: FlowRoI为高通量免疫细胞迁移研究提供了一种高效的数据压缩解决方案，在保持图像质量的同时显著提高了压缩效率。

Abstract: Autonomous migration is essential for the function of immune cells such as neutrophils and plays a pivotal role in diverse diseases. Recently, we introduced ComplexEye, a multi-lens array microscope comprising 16 independent aberration-corrected glass lenses arranged at the pitch of a 96-well plate, capable of capturing high-resolution movies of migrating cells. This architecture enables high-throughput live-cell video microscopy for migration analysis, supporting routine quantification of autonomous motility with strong potential for clinical translation. However, ComplexEye and similar high-throughput imaging platforms generate data at an exponential rate, imposing substantial burdens on storage and transmission. To address this challenge, we present FlowRoI, a fast optical-flow-based region of interest (RoI) extraction framework designed for high-throughput image compression in immune cell migration studies. FlowRoI estimates optical flow between consecutive frames and derives RoI masks that reliably cover nearly all migrating cells. The raw image and its corresponding RoI mask are then jointly encoded using JPEG2000 to enable RoI-aware compression. FlowRoI operates with high computational efficiency, achieving runtimes comparable to standard JPEG2000 and reaching an average throughput of about 30 frames per second on a modern laptop equipped with an Intel i7-1255U CPU. In terms of image quality, FlowRoI yields higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) in cellular regions and achieves 2.0-2.2x higher compression rates at matched PSNR compared to standard JPEG2000.

Conclusion: mirage infusion技术有效解决了扩散模型在晶体生成中的原子数量限制问题，大幅提升了S.U.N.材料发现能力。

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion-based models have demonstrated exceptional performance in searching for simultaneously stable, unique, and novel (S.U.N.) crystalline materials. However, most of these models don't have the ability to change the number of atoms in the crystal during the generation process, which limits the variability of model sampling trajectories. In this paper, we demonstrate the severity of this restriction and introduce a simple yet powerful technique, mirage infusion, which enables diffusion models to change the state of the atoms that make up the crystal from existent to non-existent (mirage) and vice versa. We show that this technique improves model quality by up to $\times2.5$ compared to the same model without this modification. The resulting model, Mirage Atom Diffusion (MiAD), is an equivariant joint diffusion model for de novo crystal generation that is capable of altering the number of atoms during the generation process. MiAD achieves an $8.2\%$ S.U.N. rate on the MP-20 dataset, which substantially exceeds existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 连续心血管监测在精准健康中起关键作用，但关键心脏生物标志物如每搏输出量和心输出量需要侵入性测量。作为非侵入性替代方案，PPG测量在临床常规收集，但从PPG预测这些生物标志物仍面临挑战且缺乏标注数据。

Result: 实验表明该方法能够检测心输出量和每搏输出量的波动，并在监测这些生物标志物时间变化方面优于监督基线方法。

Conclusion: 该混合方法为从PPG信号直接估计心血管生物标志物提供了可行的解决方案，克服了标注数据稀缺的问题。

Abstract: Continuous cardiovascular monitoring can play a key role in precision health. However, some fundamental cardiac biomarkers of interest, including stroke volume and cardiac output, require invasive measurements, e.g., arterial pressure waveforms (APW). As a non-invasive alternative, photoplethysmography (PPG) measurements are routinely collected in hospital settings. Unfortunately, the prediction of key cardiac biomarkers from PPG instead of APW remains an open challenge, further complicated by the scarcity of annotated PPG measurements. As a solution, we propose a hybrid approach that uses hemodynamic simulations and unlabeled clinical data to estimate cardiovascular biomarkers directly from PPG signals. Our hybrid model combines a conditional variational autoencoder trained on paired PPG-APW data with a conditional density estimator of cardiac biomarkers trained on labeled simulated APW segments. As a key result, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can detect fluctuations of cardiac output and stroke volume and outperform a supervised baseline in monitoring temporal changes in these biomarkers.

TL;DR: CPFN是一种用于条件分布估计的生成框架，通过学**随机映射来近似条件分布，支持高效的条件采样和条件统计量估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有条件分布估计方法在条件采样和统计量估计方面存在效率问题，需要一种既能准确建模条件分布又支持高效采样的轻量级方法。

Method: CPFN学**一个随机映射φ(x,u)，使得φ(x,U)与Y|X=x的分布近似相同，使用KL散度目标函数进行训练，无需可逆性或对抗训练。

Result: 实验表明CPFN在性能上可与或优于核估计、基于树的算法和深度学习等最先进方法，同时保持轻量级和易于训练的特点。

Conclusion: CPFN提供了一种高效的条件分布估计框架，在保持竞争力的同时简化了训练过程，适用于条件采样和统计量估计任务。

Abstract: We introduce conditional push-forward neural networks (CPFN), a generative framework for conditional distribution estimation. Instead of directly modeling the conditional density $f_{Y|X}$, CPFN learns a stochastic map $\varphi=\varphi(x,u)$ such that $\varphi(x,U)$ and $Y|X=x$ follow approximately the same law, with $U$ a suitable random vector of pre-defined latent variables. This enables efficient conditional sampling and straightforward estimation of conditional statistics through Monte Carlo methods. The model is trained via an objective function derived from a Kullback-Leibler formulation, without requiring invertibility or adversarial training. We establish a near-asymptotic consistency result and demonstrate experimentally that CPFN can achieve performance competitive with, or even superior to, state-of-the-art methods, including kernel estimators, tree-based algorithms, and popular deep learning techniques, all while remaining lightweight and easy to train.

*Clément Dumas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: nnterp是一个轻量级的NNsight包装器，为transformer分析提供统一接口，同时保留原始HuggingFace实现，解决了现有工具在一致性和准确性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机制可解释性研究工具面临基本权衡：定制实现（如TransformerLens）确保接口一致但需要手动适配每个架构，而直接使用HuggingFace（通过NNsight）保留精确行为但缺乏跨模型标准化。

Method: 开发nnterp作为NNsight的轻量级包装器，通过自动模块重命名和全面验证测试，提供统一的transformer分析接口，同时保持原始HuggingFace实现。

Result: nnterp使研究人员能够编写一次干预代码，并在50+模型变体和16个架构家族中部署，包含常见可解释性方法的内置实现，并提供对注意力概率的直接访问。

Conclusion: nnterp在机制可解释性工具中弥合了正确性和可用性之间的差距。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability research requires reliable tools for analyzing transformer internals across diverse architectures. Current approaches face a fundamental tradeoff: custom implementations like TransformerLens ensure consistent interfaces but require coding a manual adaptation for each architecture, introducing numerical mismatch with the original models, while direct HuggingFace access through NNsight preserves exact behavior but lacks standardization across models. To bridge this gap, we develop nnterp, a lightweight wrapper around NNsight that provides a unified interface for transformer analysis while preserving original HuggingFace implementations. Through automatic module renaming and comprehensive validation testing, nnterp enables researchers to write intervention code once and deploy it across 50+ model variants spanning 16 architecture families. The library includes built-in implementations of common interpretability methods (logit lens, patchscope, activation steering) and provides direct access to attention probabilities for models that support it. By packaging validation tests with the library, researchers can verify compatibility with custom models locally. nnterp bridges the gap between correctness and usability in mechanistic interpretability tooling.

Abstract: These notes provide a self-contained introduction to kernel methods and their geometric foundations in machine learning. Starting from the construction of Hilbert spaces, we develop the theory of positive definite kernels, reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), and Hilbert-Schmidt operators, emphasizing their role in statistical estimation and representation of probability measures. Classical concepts such as covariance, regression, and information measures are revisited through the lens of Hilbert space geometry. We also introduce kernel density estimation, kernel embeddings of distributions, and the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). The exposition is designed to serve as a foundation for more advanced topics, including Gaussian processes, kernel Bayesian inference, and functional analytic approaches to modern machine learning.

TL;DR: PAFM是一个扰动感知的流匹配框架，通过建模扰动轨迹来确保稳定和结构一致的时间序列生成，解决了传统流匹配方法在捕捉扰动时间序列中突变转换方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列生成在众多应用中至关重要，但局部扰动引起的时间异质性给生成结构一致的时间序列带来了重大挑战。传统流匹配方法由于使用全局共享参数，无法充分捕捉扰动时间序列中的突变转换。

Conclusion: PAFM框架通过扰动感知建模，能够生成更稳定和结构一致的时间序列，解决了传统流匹配方法在扰动场景下的局限性。

Abstract: Time series generation is critical for a wide range of applications, which greatly supports downstream analytical and decision-making tasks. However, the inherent temporal heterogeneous induced by localized perturbations present significant challenges for generating structurally consistent time series. While flow matching provides a promising paradigm by modeling temporal dynamics through trajectory-level supervision, it fails to adequately capture abrupt transitions in perturbed time series, as the use of globally shared parameters constrains the velocity field to a unified representation. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{PAFM}, a \textbf{P}erturbation-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{F}low \textbf{M}atching framework that models perturbed trajectories to ensure stable and structurally consistent time series generation. The framework incorporates perturbation-guided training to simulate localized disturbances and leverages a dual-path velocity field to capture trajectory deviations under perturbation, enabling refined modeling of perturbed behavior to enhance the structural coherence. In order to further improve sensitivity to trajectory perturbations while enhancing expressiveness, a mixture-of-experts decoder with flow routing dynamically allocates modeling capacity in response to different trajectory dynamics. Extensive experiments on both unconditional and conditional generation tasks demonstrate that PAFM consistently outperforms strong baselines.

TL;DR: CLO是一个通过算法-系统协同设计实现的CPU轻量级KVCache卸载系统，解决了现有系统在CPU瓶颈、PCIe带宽利用和GPU同步方面的不足，显著提升了LLM推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着百万token LLM的发展，推理系统的可扩展性面临挑战，其中KVCache主导了内存使用和数据传输开销。现有卸载系统虽然将KVCache迁移到CPU内存并采用top-k注意力，但忽视了CPU瓶颈的三个关键方面：细粒度动态缓存管理开销、PCIe带宽利用率低以及GPU运行时气泡。

Method: CLO通过算法-系统协同设计实现：1）粗粒度的头级近似GPU缓存策略；2）数据预取与GPU持久缓存的无缝结合；3）零拷贝传输引擎充分利用PCIe带宽；4）GPU中心同步方法消除GPU停顿。

Result: 在两个广泛使用的LLM上的评估表明，CLO在保持与最先进系统相当精度的同时，显著减少CPU开销，充分利用PCIe带宽，将解码吞吐量提高了9.3%-66.6%。

Conclusion: 算法-系统协同设计对于现代GPU平台上内存受限的LLM推理至关重要。CLO已开源在GitHub上。

Abstract: The growth of million-token LLMs exposes the scalability limits of inference systems, where the KVCache dominates memory usage and data transfer overhead. Recent offloading systems migrate the KVCache to CPU memory and incorporate top-k attention to reduce the volume of data transferred from the CPU, while further applying system-level optimizations such as on-GPU caching and prefetching to lower transfer overhead. However, they overlook the CPU bottleneck in three aspects: (1) substantial overhead of fine-grained dynamic cache management performed on the CPU side, (2) significant transfer overhead from poor PCIe bandwidth utilization caused by heavy gathering operations at the CPU side, and (3) GPU runtime bubbles introduced by coarse-grained CPU-centric synchronization. To address these challenges, we propose CLO, a CPU-light KVCache offloading system via algorithm-system co-design. CLO features: (1) a coarse-grained head-wise approximate on-GPU caching strategy with negligible cache management cost, (2) seamless combination of data prefetching and on-GPU persistent caching for lower transfer overhead, (3) a zero-copy transfer engine to fully exploit PCIe bandwidth, and a GPU-centric synchronization method to eliminate GPU stalls. Evaluation on two widely-used LLMs demonstrates that CLO achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art systems, while substantially minimizing CPU overhead, fully utilizing PCIe bandwidth, thus improving decoding throughput by 9.3%-66.6%. Our results highlight that algorithm-system co-design is essential for memory-constrained LLM inference on modern GPU platforms. We open source CLO at https://github.com/CommediaJW/CLO.

TL;DR: PepBFN是首个用于全原子肽设计的贝叶斯流网络，通过在完全连续空间中直接建模参数分布来解决扩散和流匹配模型在肽结合剂设计中的两个主要挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前扩散和流匹配模型在肽设计中的两个问题：1) 离散残基类型的分类采样与连续参数更新不匹配；2) 侧链扭转角的单模态分布假设与多模态旋转异构体状态的本质冲突。

Method: 提出PepBFN模型，在完全连续空间中直接建模参数分布：学习离散残基类型的连续参数分布实现平滑贝叶斯更新；使用高斯混合贝叶斯流捕获多模态侧链旋转异构体状态；使用基于Matrix Fisher的黎曼流直接建模SO(3)流形上的残基取向。

Result: 在侧链堆积、反向折叠和结合剂设计任务上的实验证明了PepBFN在计算肽设计中的强大潜力。

Conclusion: PepBFN通过贝叶斯更新逐步细化参数分布，实现了平滑连贯的肽生成，为计算肽设计提供了有前景的方法。

Abstract: Diffusion and flow matching models have recently emerged as promising approaches for peptide binder design. Despite their progress, these models still face two major challenges. First, categorical sampling of discrete residue types collapses their continuous parameters into onehot assignments, while continuous variables (e.g., atom positions) evolve smoothly throughout the generation process. This mismatch disrupts the update dynamics and results in suboptimal performance. Second, current models assume unimodal distributions for side-chain torsion angles, which conflicts with the inherently multimodal nature of side chain rotameric states and limits prediction accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce PepBFN, the first Bayesian flow network for full atom peptide design that directly models parameter distributions in fully continuous space. Specifically, PepBFN models discrete residue types by learning their continuous parameter distributions, enabling joint and smooth Bayesian updates with other continuous structural parameters. It further employs a novel Gaussian mixture based Bayesian flow to capture the multimodal side chain rotameric states and a Matrix Fisher based Riemannian flow to directly model residue orientations on the $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ manifold. Together, these parameter distributions are progressively refined via Bayesian updates, yielding smooth and coherent peptide generation. Experiments on side chain packing, reverse folding, and binder design tasks demonstrate the strong potential of PepBFN in computational peptide design.

Conclusion: 结构感知的扩散过程对于推进深度学习处理不完整表格数据方法具有重要意义。

Abstract: Incomplete data are common in real-world tabular applications, where numerical, categorical, and discrete attributes coexist within a single dataset. This heterogeneous structure presents significant challenges for existing diffusion-based imputation models, which typically assume a homogeneous feature space and rely on stochastic denoising trajectories. Such assumptions make it difficult to maintain conditional consistency, and they often lead to information collapse for categorical variables or instability when numerical variables require deterministic updates. These limitations indicate that a single diffusion process is insufficient for mixed-type tabular imputation.
  We propose a hybrid deterministic diffusion framework that separates heterogeneous features into two complementary generative channels. A continuous DDIM-based channel provides efficient and stable deterministic denoising for numerical variables, while a discrete latent-path diffusion channel, inspired by loopholing-based discrete diffusion, models categorical and discrete features without leaving their valid sample manifolds. The two channels are trained under a unified conditional imputation objective, enabling coherent reconstruction of mixed-type incomplete data.
  Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets show that the proposed framework achieves higher imputation accuracy, more stable sampling trajectories, and improved robustness across MCAR, MAR, and MNAR settings compared with existing diffusion-based and classical methods. These results demonstrate the importance of structure-aware diffusion processes for advancing deep learning approaches to incomplete tabular data.

Result: 引入了一个新的度量指标，能够更好地评估降维投影的视觉保真度。

Conclusion: Warping Index为降维投影质量评估提供了新的视角，特别关注视觉分析中容易被忽视的空区域保持问题。

Abstract: Dimensionality Reduction (DR) techniques are commonly used for the visual exploration and analysis of high-dimensional data due to their ability to project datasets of high-dimensional points onto the 2D plane. However, projecting datasets in lower dimensions often entails some distortion, which is not necessarily easy to recognize but can lead users to misleading conclusions. Several Projection Quality Metrics (PQMs) have been developed as tools to quantify the goodness-of-fit of a DR projection; however, they mostly focus on measuring how well the projection captures the global or local structure of the data, without taking into account the visual distortion of the resulting plots, thus often ignoring the presence of outliers or artifacts that can mislead a visual analysis of the projection. In this work, we introduce the Warping Index (WI), a new metric for measuring the quality of DR projections onto the 2D plane, based on the assumption that the correct preservation of empty regions between points is of crucial importance towards a faithful visual representation of the data.

Abstract: Task arithmetic has recently emerged as a promising method for editing pre-trained \textit{open-vocabulary} models, offering a cost-effective alternative to standard multi-task fine-tuning. However, despite the abundance of \textit{closed-vocabulary} models that are not pre-trained with language supervision, applying task arithmetic to these models remains unexplored. In this paper, we deploy and study task addition in closed-vocabulary image classification models. We consider different pre-training schemes and find that \textit{weight disentanglement} -- the property enabling task arithmetic -- is a general consequence of pre-training, as it appears in different pre-trained closed-vocabulary models. In fact, we find that pre-trained closed-vocabulary vision transformers can also be edited with task arithmetic, achieving high task addition performance and enabling the efficient deployment of multi-task models. Finally, we demonstrate that simple linear probing is a competitive baseline to task addition. Overall, our findings expand the applicability of task arithmetic to a broader class of pre-trained models and open the way for more efficient use of pre-trained models in diverse settings.

Conclusion: 互补学习机制的协同整合能够实现强大的零样本泛化能力，接近先前工作的少样本基线性能。

Abstract: Enabling agents to learn from experience and generalize across diverse tasks without task-specific training remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning and decision-making. While recent approaches have explored episodic memory (Reflexion), gradient-based prompt optimization (TextGrad),and hierarchical task decomposition independently, their potential for synergistic integration remains unexplored. We introduce ReflexGrad, a novel architecture that tightly couples three complementary mechanisms: (1) LLM-based hierarchical TODO decomposition for strategic planning, (2) history-aware causal reflection that analyzes recent action patterns to identify failure root causes and enable within-trial learning, and (3) gradient-based optimization for systematic improvement. Unlike prior work relying on few-shot demonstrations, our system achieves true zero-shot generalization through pure LLM semantic reasoning,requiring no task-specific examples, fine-tuning, or hardcoded similarity metrics. Evaluated on ALFWorld benchmark tasks, ReflexGrad demonstrates 67% zero-shot success rate on Trial 0 without any prior task experience or demonstrations, establishing effective performance on first exposure. Through empirical analysis, we identify the architectural mechanisms underlying stable convergence (zero action loops) and effective cross-task transfer (67% to 78% improvement).Our work demonstrates that synergistic integration of complementary learning mechanisms enables robust zero-shot generalization that approaches few-shot baselines from prior work.

Abstract: Learning the parameters of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) from limited data is a significant challenge. We introduce the Fuzzy MAP EM algorithm, a novel approach that incorporates expert knowledge into the parameter estimation process by enriching the Expectation Maximization (EM) framework with fuzzy pseudo-counts derived from an expert-defined fuzzy model. This integration naturally reformulates the problem as a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation, effectively guiding learning in environments with limited data. In synthetic medical simulations, our method consistently outperforms the standard EM algorithm under both low-data and high-noise conditions. Furthermore, a case study on Myasthenia Gravis illustrates the ability of the Fuzzy MAP EM algorithm to recover a clinically coherent POMDP, demonstrating its potential as a practical tool for data-efficient modeling in healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学思想生成和选择需要遵循目标概率分布进行探索，而当前AI基准有客观正确答案，通过强化学习训练LLM会抑制概率探索。

Method: 进行系统实验，要求LLM按照简单概率分布生成输出，测试模型遵循分布的能力。

Result: 所有测试的现代LLM都严重无法遵循分布，即使内置强偏见也会被边际最高概率输出所覆盖。

Conclusion: LLM在概率探索方面存在根本性缺陷，无法有效模拟科学思想生成所需的概率分布行为。

Abstract: Scientific idea generation and selection requires exploration following a target probability distribution. In contrast, current AI benchmarks have objectively correct answers, and training large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning against these benchmarks discourages probabilistic exploration. Here, we conducted systematic experiments requesting LLMs to produce outputs following simple probabilistic distributions, and found that all modern LLMs tested grossly fail to follow the distributions. For example, requesting a binary output of "1" 49% of the time produces an answer of "0" nearly 100% of the time. This step function-like behavior of near-exclusively generating the output with marginally highest probability even overrules even strong in-built LLM biases.

Conclusion: Adapformer通过有效的通道管理策略，成功解决了多变量时间序列预测中的依赖关系建模挑战，实现了更好的预测性能和计算效率。

Abstract: In multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), accurately modeling the intricate dependencies among multiple variables remains a significant challenge due to the inherent limitations of traditional approaches. Most existing models adopt either \textbf{channel-independent} (CI) or \textbf{channel-dependent} (CD) strategies, each presenting distinct drawbacks. CI methods fail to leverage the potential insights from inter-channel interactions, resulting in models that may not fully exploit the underlying statistical dependencies present in the data. Conversely, CD approaches often incorporate too much extraneous information, risking model overfitting and predictive inefficiency. To address these issues, we introduce the Adaptive Forecasting Transformer (\textbf{Adapformer}), an advanced Transformer-based framework that merges the benefits of CI and CD methodologies through effective channel management. The core of Adapformer lies in its dual-stage encoder-decoder architecture, which includes the \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{C}hannel \textbf{E}nhancer (\textbf{ACE}) for enriching embedding processes and the \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{C}hannel \textbf{F}orecaster (\textbf{ACF}) for refining the predictions. ACE enhances token representations by selectively incorporating essential dependencies, while ACF streamlines the decoding process by focusing on the most relevant covariates, substantially reducing noise and redundancy. Our rigorous testing on diverse datasets shows that Adapformer achieves superior performance over existing models, enhancing both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, thus making it state-of-the-art in MTSF.

Motivation: 吸烟是全球主要可预防死因，但现有医疗筛查方法常错过早期预警信号，导致晚期诊断。本研究旨在开发基于机器学习的早期风险评估方法。

Method: 分析了55,691人的健康筛查数据，测试了随机森林、XGBoost和LightGBM三种算法，使用SHAP分析解释模型预测。

Abstract: Smoking continues to be a major preventable cause of death worldwide, affecting millions through damage to the heart, metabolism, liver, and kidneys. However, current medical screening methods often miss the early warning signs of smoking-related health problems, leading to late-stage diagnoses when treatment options become limited. This study presents a systematic comparative evaluation of machine learning approaches for smoking-related health risk assessment, emphasizing clinical interpretability and practical deployment over algorithmic innovation. We analyzed health screening data from 55,691 individuals, examining various health indicators, including body measurements, blood tests, and demographic information. We tested three advanced prediction algorithms - Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM - to determine which could most accurately identify people at high risk. This study employed a cross-sectional design to classify current smoking status based on health screening biomarkers, not to predict future disease development. Our Random Forest model performed best, achieving an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.926, meaning it could reliably distinguish between high-risk and lower-risk individuals. Using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to understand what the model was detecting, we found that key health markers played crucial roles in prediction: blood pressure levels, triglyceride concentrations, liver enzyme readings, and kidney function indicators (serum creatinine) were the strongest signals of declining health in smokers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FLARE是一个自适应信誉联邦学习框架，通过多维信誉评分、自适应阈值和信誉加权聚合来防御拜占庭攻击，在多种攻击场景下保持高模型精度和收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习防御机制依赖静态阈值和二元分类，无法适应现实部署中不断演变的客户端行为，容易受到恶意客户端的攻击。

Method: 提出FLARE框架，包括：多维信誉评分系统、自校准自适应阈值机制、信誉加权聚合与软排除、本地差分隐私机制，并引入统计模仿攻击作为基准对抗测试。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和SVHN数据集上的实验表明，FLARE在多种攻击类型下保持高模型精度，收敛速度优于现有方法，鲁棒性提升达16%，模型收敛保持在非攻击基线的30%以内。

Conclusion: FLARE有效提升了联邦学习的安全性，能够适应动态攻击环境，在保证隐私的同时实现高效的恶意客户端检测和防御。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, it remains vulnerable to malicious clients who compromise model integrity through Byzantine attacks, data poisoning, or adaptive adversarial behaviors. Existing defense mechanisms rely on static thresholds and binary classification, failing to adapt to evolving client behaviors in real-world deployments. We propose FLARE, an adaptive reputation-based framework that transforms client reliability assessment from binary decisions to a continuous, multi-dimensional trust evaluation. FLARE integrates: (i) a multi-dimensional reputation score capturing performance consistency, statistical anomaly indicators, and temporal behavior, (ii) a self-calibrating adaptive threshold mechanism that adjusts security strictness based on model convergence and recent attack intensity, (iii) reputation-weighted aggregation with soft exclusion to proportionally limit suspicious contributions rather than eliminating clients outright, and (iv) a Local Differential Privacy (LDP) mechanism enabling reputation scoring on privatized client updates. We further introduce a highly evasive Statistical Mimicry (SM) attack, a benchmark adversary that blends honest gradients with synthetic perturbations and persistent drift to remain undetected by traditional filters. Extensive experiments with 100 clients on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that FLARE maintains high model accuracy and converges faster than state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust methods under diverse attack types, including label flipping, gradient scaling, adaptive attacks, ALIE, and SM. FLARE improves robustness by up to 16% and preserves model convergence within 30% of the non-attacked baseline, while achieving strong malicious-client detection performance with minimal computational overhead. https://github.com/Anonymous0-0paper/FLARE

*Fu-Ming Guo,Yingfang Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出AdamHuberDecay作为AdamW的替代方案，使用解耦的平滑Huber正则化器替代ℓ2惩罚，在GPT-2和GPT-3预训练中实现更快的收敛、更好的性能和更高的稀疏性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AdamW中的ℓ2惩罚会使所有参数以相同速率向原点移动，容易受到极端梯度方向的影响，并且经常过度惩罚条件良好的坐标。

Method: 用解耦的平滑Huber正则化器替代ℓ2惩罚，当参数幅度低于阈值δ时进行二次衰减，超过δ时进行线性（ℓ1类）衰减。

Result: 在GPT-2和GPT-3预训练中：收敛速度提高10-15%，验证困惑度降低最多4点，下游任务性能提升2.5-4.7%，通过幅度剪枝实现20-30%内存节省。

Conclusion: AdamHuberDecay为下一代基础生成变换器的训练提供了一种简单、有原则的路径，实现了更高效和更具弹性的训练。

Abstract: Adaptive optimizers with decoupled weight decay, such as AdamW, are the de facto standard for pre-training large transformer-based generative models. Yet the quadratic nature of the $\ell_2$ penalty embedded in weight decay drives all parameters toward the origin at the same rate, making the update vulnerable to rare but extreme gradient directions and often over-penalizing well-conditioned coordinates. We propose AdamHuberDecay, a drop-in replacement for AdamW that substitutes the $\ell_2$ penalty with a decoupled smooth Huber regularizer. The resulting update decays parameters quadratically while their magnitude remains below a threshold $δ$, and linearly ($\ell_1$-like) once they exceed $δ$, yielding (i) bounded regularization gradients, (ii) invariance to per-coordinate second-moment rescaling, and (iii) stronger sparsity pressure on overgrown weights.
  We derive the closed-form decoupled Huber decay step and show how to integrate it with any Adam-family optimizer at $O(1)$ extra cost. Extensive experiments on GPT-2 and GPT-3 pre-training demonstrate that AdamHuberDecay (a) converges 10-15% faster in wall-clock time, (b) reduces validation perplexity by up to 4 points, (c) delivers performance improvements of 2.5-4.7% across downstream tasks, and (d) yields visibly sparser weight histograms that translate into 20-30% memory savings after magnitude pruning, without tuning the decay coefficient beyond the default grid used for AdamW. Ablations confirm robustness to outlier gradients and large-batch regimes, together with theoretical analyses that bound the expected parameter norm under noisy updates. AdamHuberDecay therefore provides a simple, principled path toward more efficient and resilient training of next-generation foundational generative transformers.

Motivation: 在现实场景中，缺乏标注数据使得从业者难以获得性能良好的模型，只能依赖繁琐低效的基于提示的方法。

Method: 提出LAUD框架，将大语言模型与主动学习结合，通过零样本学习缓解冷启动问题，构建初始标签集。

Result: 实验结果显示，基于LAUD的大语言模型在商品名称分类任务中优于零样本或少样本学习方法。

Conclusion: LAUD框架有效解决了缺乏标注数据的问题，展示了大语言模型与主动学习结合的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown a remarkable ability to generalize beyond their pre-training data, and fine-tuning LLMs can elevate performance to human-level and beyond. However, in real-world scenarios, lacking labeled data often prevents practitioners from obtaining well-performing models, thereby forcing practitioners to highly rely on prompt-based approaches that are often tedious, inefficient, and driven by trial and error. To alleviate this issue of lacking labeled data, we present a learning framework integrating LLMs with active learning for unlabeled dataset (LAUD). LAUD mitigates the cold-start problem by constructing an initial label set with zero-shot learning. Experimental results show that LLMs derived from LAUD outperform LLMs with zero-shot or few-shot learning on commodity name classification tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of LAUD.

TL;DR: 使用高斯过程模型进行在线评分聚合，相比传统均值方法能更好地捕捉评分随时间的变化和评论异质性，预测准确性提高10.2%。


<details>

Motivation: 传统评分聚合方法（如样本均值）无法适应质量随时间变化，且忽略评论异质性（如评论情感、有用性），需要更智能的聚合方法。

Method: 提出定制化的高斯过程模型，捕捉评分随时间动态变化，同时考虑评论异质性因素。

Result: 基于121,123条Yelp评分数据，高斯过程模型预测未来评分的准确性显著提升，相比样本均值减少10.2%的平均绝对误差。

Conclusion: 高斯过程模型为在线声誉系统提供了更准确、自适应的评分聚合方法，能更好地反映预期客户满意度。

Abstract: Online ratings influence customer decision-making, yet standard aggregation methods, such as the sample mean, fail to adapt to quality changes over time and ignore review heterogeneity (e.g., review sentiment, a review's helpfulness). To address these challenges, we demonstrate the value of using the Gaussian process (GP) framework for rating aggregation. Specifically, we present a tailored GP model that captures the dynamics of ratings over time while additionally accounting for review heterogeneity. Based on 121,123 ratings from Yelp, we compare the predictive power of different rating aggregation methods in predicting future ratings, thereby finding that the GP model is considerably more accurate and reduces the mean absolute error by 10.2% compared to the sample mean. Our findings have important implications for marketing practitioners and customers. By moving beyond means, designers of online reputation systems can display more informative and adaptive aggregated rating scores that are accurate signals of expected customer satisfaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于Tox21数据集在整合到基准测试时被修改和标签被推算，导致研究间可比性丧失，无法清晰评估过去十年生物活性和毒性预测方法的改进程度。

Method: 创建了一个基于原始Tox21挑战数据集的、在Hugging Face上托管的可复现排行榜，包含基准方法和代表性方法，并通过标准化API调用公开所有模型。

Result: 排行榜显示原始的DeepTox集成方法和2017年引入的基于描述符的自归一化神经网络仍然具有竞争力，位列毒性预测的顶级方法之列。

Conclusion: 过去十年毒性预测领域是否取得实质性进展仍不明确，因为原始获胜方法至今仍保持竞争力。

Abstract: Deep learning's rise since the early 2010s has transformed fields like computer vision and natural language processing and strongly influenced biomedical research. For drug discovery specifically, a key inflection - akin to vision's "ImageNet moment" - arrived in 2015, when deep neural networks surpassed traditional approaches on the Tox21 Data Challenge. This milestone accelerated the adoption of deep learning across the pharmaceutical industry, and today most major companies have integrated these methods into their research pipelines. After the Tox21 Challenge concluded, its dataset was included in several established benchmarks, such as MoleculeNet and the Open Graph Benchmark. However, during these integrations, the dataset was altered and labels were imputed or manufactured, resulting in a loss of comparability across studies. Consequently, the extent to which bioactivity and toxicity prediction methods have improved over the past decade remains unclear. To this end, we introduce a reproducible leaderboard, hosted on Hugging Face with the original Tox21 Challenge dataset, together with a set of baseline and representative methods. The current version of the leaderboard indicates that the original Tox21 winner - the ensemble-based DeepTox method - and the descriptor-based self-normalizing neural networks introduced in 2017, continue to perform competitively and rank among the top methods for toxicity prediction, leaving it unclear whether substantial progress in toxicity prediction has been achieved over the past decade. As part of this work, we make all baselines and evaluated models publicly accessible for inference via standardized API calls to Hugging Face Spaces.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了学习平台中用户的策略性行为，重点关注前瞻性推理和集体协调行动对模型预测的影响，并与自私行为进行对比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的学习平台优化标准往往反映设计者而非用户的优先级，导致用户采取策略性行为来获取更有利的结果。过去的研究主要关注对已部署模型的策略响应，而忽略了其他用户行为的影响。

Method: 首先形式化了行为经济学中的k级思维概念，用户通过向前看一步来智胜同伴。然后研究集体推理，用户通过协调行动来优化对模型的联合影响。

Result: k级思维加速了均衡收敛但均衡点不变，高级推理在长期对个体无益。集体协调与自私行为的对比揭示了协调的收益和限制，学习者和用户效用之间的对齐成为关键概念。

Conclusion: 前瞻性推理框架揭示了用户行为耦合对模型预测的影响，集体协调行动与自私行为的对比凸显了效用对齐的重要性，为理解策略性分类、表演性预测和算法集体行动提供了新视角。

Abstract: On many learning platforms, the optimization criteria guiding model training reflect the priorities of the designer rather than those of the individuals they affect. Consequently, users may act strategically to obtain more favorable outcomes, effectively contesting the platform's predictions. While past work has studied strategic user behavior on learning platforms, the focus has largely been on strategic responses to a deployed model, without considering the behavior of other users. In contrast, look-ahead reasoning takes into account that user actions are coupled, and -- at scale -- impact future predictions. Within this framework, we first formalize level-$k$ thinking, a concept from behavioral economics, where users aim to outsmart their peers by looking one step ahead. We show that, while convergence to an equilibrium is accelerated, the equilibrium remains the same, providing no benefit of higher-level reasoning for individuals in the long run. Then, we focus on collective reasoning, where users take coordinated actions by optimizing through their joint impact on the model. By contrasting collective with selfish behavior, we characterize the benefits and limits of coordination; a new notion of alignment between the learner's and the users' utilities emerges as a key concept. We discuss connections to several related mathematical frameworks, including strategic classification, performative prediction, and algorithmic collective action.

TL;DR: SparseST是一个利用数据稀疏性开发高效时空模型的新框架，通过多目标复合损失函数探索模型性能和计算效率之间的帕累托前沿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ConvLSTM及其变体在时空数据挖掘中表现出色但计算成本高，不适用于边缘设备。现有高效AI方法主要关注模型容量冗余的减少，但时空数据挖掘需要大量模型容量，而数据和特征冗余带来的计算负担被忽视。

Method: 开发SparseST框架，利用数据稀疏性构建高效时空模型，设计多目标复合损失函数来平衡模型性能和计算效率。

Result: SparseST通过利用数据冗余减少计算负担，在保持模型性能的同时显著提升计算效率。

Conclusion: SparseST为时空数据挖掘提供了一种新的高效AI方法，特别适用于边缘计算环境，通过数据稀疏性利用解决了传统模型压缩方法的局限性。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal data mining (STDM) has a wide range of applications in various complex physical systems (CPS), i.e., transportation, manufacturing, healthcare, etc. Among all the proposed methods, the Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) has proved to be generalizable and extendable in different applications and has multiple variants achieving state-of-the-art performance in various STDM applications. However, ConvLSTM and its variants are computationally expensive, which makes them inapplicable in edge devices with limited computational resources. With the emerging need for edge computing in CPS, efficient AI is essential to reduce the computational cost while preserving the model performance. Common methods of efficient AI are developed to reduce redundancy in model capacity (i.e., model pruning, compression, etc.). However, spatiotemporal data mining naturally requires extensive model capacity, as the embedded dependencies in spatiotemporal data are complex and hard to capture, which limits the model redundancy. Instead, there is a fairly high level of data and feature redundancy that introduces an unnecessary computational burden, which has been largely overlooked in existing research. Therefore, we developed a novel framework SparseST, that pioneered in exploiting data sparsity to develop an efficient spatiotemporal model. In addition, we explore and approximate the Pareto front between model performance and computational efficiency by designing a multi-objective composite loss function, which provides a practical guide for practitioners to adjust the model according to computational resource constraints and the performance requirements of downstream tasks.

Conclusion: RECAP方法有效提升了VLA模型在真实世界任务中的性能，证明了通过整合异构数据和强化学习可以实现机器人系统的持续改进。

Abstract: We study how vision-language-action (VLA) models can improve through real-world deployments via reinforcement learning (RL). We present a general-purpose method, RL with Experience and Corrections via Advantage-conditioned Policies (RECAP), that provides for RL training of VLAs via advantage conditioning. Our method incorporates heterogeneous data into the self-improvement process, including demonstrations, data from on-policy collection, and expert teleoperated interventions provided during autonomous execution. RECAP starts by pre-training a generalist VLA with offline RL, which we call $π^{*}_{0.6}$, that can then be specialized to attain high performance on downstream tasks through on-robot data collection. We show that the $π^{*}_{0.6}$ model trained with the full RECAP method can fold laundry in real homes, reliably assemble boxes, and make espresso drinks using a professional espresso machine. On some of the hardest tasks, RECAP more than doubles task throughput and roughly halves the task failure rate.

Conclusion: 首次揭示了液氨正常爆轰不稳定性的机理，为氨燃料爆轰发动机设计提供了关键指导。

Abstract: This study presents a computational and theoretical investigation into propagation of liquid ammonia detonation, with the emphasis on assessing the impact of fuel evaporation on detonation stability. The prominent discovery is that the flash boiling of liquid ammonia leads to the decoupling of the shock and combustion waves and creates a pulsating propagation of the detonation. Theoretical nonlinear stability analysis reveals that detonation instability arises when evaporation and chemical timescales are comparable, while stability is maintained when these timescales are well separated. This work provides the first mechanistic insight into the instability of liquid ammonia normal detonation, offering crucial guidance for the design of efficient ammonia-fueled detonation engines.

Abstract: Lubricant-impregnated surfaces (LIS) and superhydrophobic surfaces (SHSs) are known to passively reduce drag over a surface, which, with a suitable design such as the ribbed texture, can also steer flows anisotropically. Analytical predictions are developed for ribbed textures using an eigenfunction expansion approach. Compared to currently available analytical predictions, these predictions demonstrate superior numerical accuracy and avoid restrictive assumptions on rib geometry, working fluid and lubricant properties. The predictions provide contrasting design prescriptions depending on whether a lower drag or a larger degree of anisotropic flow deflection is desired.

Conclusion: 所发展的几何概念虽然明确针对循环驱动的Hele-Shaw流动，但可推广到一般驱动Stokes流动，从而阐明最近在三维背景下的观测结果。

Abstract: In a canonical Stokes flow geometry, the Hele-Shaw cell, we show that tunable circulations induced by Lorentz forces in a conducting fluid enable particle control. We reveal that energy-optimal control paths correspond to geodesics of an emergent Riemannian metric, which are time-optimal under a maximum-power constraint. Particle paths exhibit metric-governed anisotropic diffusion under random boundary forcing. Our geometric concepts, though developed explicitly for circulation-driven Hele-Shaw flows, generalize to generic driven Stokes flows and so elucidate recent observations in a three-dimensional context.

Conclusion: PINN能够有效求解Navier-Stokes方程，在较低雷诺数下精度较高，且适用于时间相关流动问题，为流体力学计算提供了数据驱动的新方法。

Abstract: In recent years, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful and robust framework for solving nonlinear differential equations across a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines, including biology, geophysics, astrophysics and fluid dynamics. In the PINN framework, the governing partial differential equations, along with initial and boundary conditions, are encoded directly into the loss function, enabling the network to learn solutions that are consistent with the underlying physics. In this work, we employ the PINN framework to solve the dimensionless Navier-Stokes equations for three two-dimensional incompressible, steady, laminar flow problems without using any labeled data. The boundary and initial conditions are enforced in a hard manner, ensuring they are satisfied exactly rather than penalized during training. We validate the PINN predicted velocity profiles, drag coefficients and pressure profiles against the conventional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations for moderate to high values of Reynolds number ($Re$). It is observed that the PINN predictions show good agreement with the CFD results at lower $Re$. We also extend our analysis to a transient condition and find that our method is equally capable of simulating complex time-dependent flow dynamics. To quantitatively assess the accuracy, we compute the $L_2$ normalized error, which lies in the range $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$ - $\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$ for our chosen case studies.

Abstract: Data-driven techniques have improved the accuracy of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models in fluid dynamics. However, modeling separated flows remains challenging due to their complex physics and sensitivity to local conditions. Existing approaches often struggle with generalization beyond training cases and lack robust uncertainty quantification frameworks, limiting their utility in complex flow regimes. We propose a Bayesian neural network (BNN)-based framework specifically designed for two-dimensional separated flows. By focusing on flow zones near separated regions, we ensure targeted training and enhance predictive reliability. The BNN framework incorporates physics-guided, invariant inputs to maintain consistency with turbulence physics. Correction terms predicted by the BNN are selectively applied to specific regions of the flow domain using a novel classifier, improving accuracy. A key feature of this approach is propagating BNN-derived corrections to flow solutions, enabling uncertainty quantification in unseen test cases. This probabilistic characterization of modeling errors offers insights into the reliability of RANS predictions across geometries with similar topologies. Preliminary results demonstrate that this method accurately predicts correction terms for Reynolds stress anisotropy and turbulent kinetic energy production in separated flow regions, effectively addressing dominant modeling errors and advancing turbulence modeling through uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of pressure and velocity fluctuations in turbulent flows is essential for understanding flow-induced vibration and structural fatigue. This study investigates the role of turbulence model parameter uncertainty in such predictions using a combination of global sensitivity analysis, surrogate modeling, and Bayesian inference. The methodology is applied to two fluid-only flow cases: turbulent channel flow and turbulent annular flow. In the channel flow case, calibrated parameter distributions lead to improved agreement with reference data. In the annular case, limited parameter identifiability is observed, though predictions remain consistent with high-fidelity trends. The results demonstrate both the potential and limitations of model calibration strategies in wall-bounded turbulent flows.

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在轴对称有界域中使用在线端到端学习训练亚网格尺度(SGS)模型的方法，证明了即使在仅基于一个翻转时间的训练数据下，模型也能在远长于训练周期的积分中保持稳定和准确，并能再现慢速过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大多数研究集中在理想化的周期性域，忽略了行星内部等存在的机械边界问题，需要开发适用于有界域的SGS模型。

Method: 使用伪谱可微分解算器在轴对称有界域中模拟二维准地转湍流，通过在线端到端学习训练SGS模型，考察不同几何形状和旋转速率下的三种配置。

Result: 在所有配置中，仅基于一个翻转时间数据训练的SGS模型能在至少百倍于训练周期的积分中保持稳定和准确，并能再现如球壳中射流向内漂移等慢速过程。

Conclusion: 这为开发适用于行星和恒星内部动力学（包括发电机过程）的SGS模型提供了一条有前景的路径。

Abstract: The use of machine learning to represent subgrid-scale (SGS) dynamics is now well established in weather forecasting and climate modelling. Recent advances have demonstrated that SGS models trained via ``online'' end-to-end learning -- where the dynamical solver operating on the filtered equations participates in the training -- can outperform traditional physics-based approaches. Most studies, however, have focused on idealised periodic domains, neglecting the mechanical boundaries present e.g. in planetary interiors. To address this issue, we consider two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic turbulent flow in an axisymmetric bounded domain that we model using a pseudo-spectral differentiable solver, thereby enabling online learning. We examine three configurations, varying the geometry (between an exponential container and a spherical shell) and the rotation rate. Flow is driven by a prescribed analytical forcing, allowing for precise control over the energy injection scale and an exact estimate of the power input. We evaluate the accuracy of the online-trained SGS model against the reference direct numerical simulation using integral quantities and spectral diagnostics. In all configurations, we show that an SGS model trained on data spanning only one turnover time remains stable and accurate over integrations at least a hundred times longer than the training period. Moreover, we demonstrate the model's remarkable ability to reproduce slow processes occurring on time scales far exceeding the training duration, such as the inward drift of jets in the spherical shell. These results suggest a promising path towards developing SGS models for planetary and stellar interior dynamics, including dynamo processes.

Abstract: A new algorithm for the efficient numerical approximation of weakly singular integrals over convex polytopes is introduced. Such integrals appear in the Galerkin discretizations of integral equations and nonlocal partial differential equations. The polytope is decomposed into a number of convex hulls of a singular and regular face. This expresses the singularity in a single variable which is effectively handled by Gauss-Jacobi quadrature. The decomposition algorithm is applicable to general finite polytopes. The Cartesian product of two simplices and two cubes will be discussed as special cases and numerical examples will be presented to illustrate the convergence of the resulting quadrature scheme.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 提出一种基于CUR分解的方法，用于求解大规模多项线性矩阵方程，通过将原问题分解为两个较小的子问题，并利用离散经验插值法选择行和列，实现了高效求解。


<details>

Motivation: 大规模多项线性矩阵方程的高效求解器在数值线性代数中仍是一个未解决的核心挑战，现有方法难以处理大规模问题。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效扩展到大规模问题，不依赖Sylvester结构，通过秩自适应机制动态调整计算秩以达到所需精度。

Abstract: Developing efficient solvers for large-scale multi-term linear matrix equations remains a central challenge in numerical linear algebra and is still largely unresolved. This paper introduces a methodology leveraging CUR decomposition for solving large-scale generalized Sylvester as well as non-Sylvester multi-term equations on low-rank matrix manifolds. The approach decomposes the original equation into two smaller subproblems: one involving all columns with a small subset of rows, and the other involving all rows with a small subset of columns. The rows and columns are strategically selected using the discrete empirical interpolation method. We further utilize the CUR properties and propose a novel iterative scheme that removes the dependencies between selected and unselected rows (and likewise for columns), thereby enabling the subset problems to be solved independently. We present a Krylov-based scheme for solving the resulting subproblems, which scales effectively to large problems and does not rely on a Sylvester structure. The method incorporates rank adaptivity, dynamically adjusting computational rank to reach the desired accuracy. The methodology is demonstrated in three representative settings: (i) implicit time integration of matrix differential equations on low-rank manifolds, leading to multi-term linear matrix equations; (ii) large-scale steady-state generalized Lyapunov equations including cases of size up to $10^{13}$ unknown entries; and (iii) non-Sylvester linear matrix equations with Hadamard product terms, such as those arising in nonlinear partial differential equations.

Abstract: This paper presents a phase-field model for simulating the three-dimensional deformation of vesicle membranes, incorporating area-difference elasticity, with constraints on bulk volume and surface area. We develop efficient numerical schemes based on the Fourier-spectral method for spatial discretization and temporal evolution. The model successfully captures a wide variety of steady-state vesicle shapes. The numerical experiments demonstrate that by tuning the simulation parameters, the vesicle can transition from a simple discocyte shape to a complex, multi-armed starfish-like and nested configuration. These results highlight the crucial role of area-difference elasticity in determining vesicle morphology.

Abstract: High-order nodal space-time flux reconstruction (STFR) methods have been developed to solve hyperbolic conservation laws on curvilinear moving grids. Unlike the method-of-lines approach for moving domain simulation, the grid velocity is implicitly embedded into the curvilinear geometric representation of space-time elements. Several key issues in moving domain simulation, including the discrete geometric conservation law (GCL), solution and flux approximation, and aliasing error control, are discussed in the context of the nodal STFR framework. Conditions and the corresponding numerical strategies to reduce aliasing errors due to the curvilinear space-time representation of moving domain problems, including the discrete GCL errors (i.e. one type of aliasing errors in the space-time framework), are then explained and examined. Since a space-time tensor product is used to construct the FR formulation in this study, all space-time schemes show the temporal superconvergence property, similar to that presented by the implicit Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin (IRK-DG) schemes, in moving domain simulation. Specifically, a nominal $k$th order scheme can achieve a ($2k-1$)th order superconvergence rate when solutions on $k$ Gauss-Legendre points are used to construct polynomials in the time dimension. The robustness of temporal superconvergence in the existence of aliasing errors induced by the curvilinear space-time representation, and upon de-aliasing operations based on polynomial filtering, has been examined with numerical experiments.

Abstract: The problem under consideration is to drive a spatial vehicle to a target at a given final time while minimizing fuel consumption. This is a classical optimal control problem in a deterministic setting. However temporary stochastic failures of the engine may prevent reaching the target after the engine usage is recovered. Therefore, a stochastic optimal control problem is formulated under the constraint of ensuring a minimal probability of hitting the target. This problem is modeled, improved and finally solved by dualizing the probability constraint and using an Arrow-Hurwicz stochastic algorithm. Numerical results concerning an interplanetary mission are presented.

Abstract: This paper develops a finite-difference analogue of the boundary integral/element method for the numerical solution of two-dimensional exterior scattering from scatterers of arbitrary shapes. The discrete fundamental solution, known as the lattice Green's function (LGF), for the Helmholtz equation on an infinite lattice is derived and employed to construct boundary algebraic equations through the discrete potentials framework. Unlike the continuous fundamental solution used in boundary integral methods, the LGF introduces no singularity, which simplifies numerical implementation. Boundary conditions are incorporated through local Lagrange interpolation on unfitted cut cells. The resulting method retains key advantages of boundary integral approaches-including dimension reduction and the absence of artificial boundary conditions--while enabling finite differences for complex geometries. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the method for various scatterers, including circular, triangular, and multiple-body configurations.

Abstract: Approximate duals of B-splines were first used by Chui et al. (2004) for the purpose of constructing tight wavelet frames on bounded intervals. They are splines with local support, whose inner product with a polynomial in the spline space provides the exact coefficient in the representation of the same polynomial in the B-spline basis. This implies that the associated integral operator is a quasi-projection in the sense of Jia (2004). Moreover, the approximation of smooth functions in Sobolev spaces by this quasi-projection yields the optimal approximation order. More recently, for applications in isogeometric analysis, the optimal approximation order should also be obtained for functions in a slightly larger space, the so-called bent Sobolev space defined in \cite{Bazilevsetal2006,daVeigaetal2014}. This requires the construction of enhanced approximate duals, whose corresponding integral operator provides the exact representation of all spline functions with respect to a coarse knot vector, using only few interior knots of the given knot vector. Our analysis provides an explicit construction and hints for an efficient computation of enhanced approximate duals. Explicit representations as linear combinations of B-splines are provided for $m=2$ and $m=3$, and two numerical examples for splines of order $3\le m\le 6$ demonstrate the optimal approximation order for functions in bent Sobolev spaces.

Abstract: In the Chilean local alcohol industry (pisco indus- try), for one liter of alcohol produced 10-15 liters of vinasse as the main wastewater of the process. To comply with industrial waste regulations, vinasse must be stored, which enables evaporation, leaving behind a residual sludge. However, treating vinasse remains an environmental and industrial challenge, having a high nutrient concentration and acidity that can degrade soil quality and harm surrounding vegetation. While previous studies have modeled sludge generation and transport in urban water systems, research on industrial wastewater, such as the alcohol industry, remains limited, affecting the search for opportunities to improve the treatment process.. This paper proposes a System Dynamics Model (SDM) to assess the costs associated with three management strategies: natural drying of vinasse, relocation to an alternative site, and implementation of a coagulation- flocculation treatment to accelerate sludge production. This paper makes two contributions. First, we describe a pioneer SDM applicable to sludge management, which includes variables such as sludge transport, coagulant quantity, and ambient temperature to make hypothetical scenarios that affect the treatment processes of vinasse. Second, we present the expected results of the associated costs of the scenarios proposed in the model, helping decision-makers to manage vinasse. The model is calibrated with historical data provided by a company in the North of Chile, helping to improve the decision-making for vinasse treatment.

Abstract: In this paper, we perform an optimal L2-norm error analysis of a fully discrete convex-splitting finite element method (FEM) for the two-phase diffuse interface magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) system. The method use the semi-implicit backward Euler scheme in time and use the standard inf-sup stable Taylor-Hood/Mini elements to discretize the velocity and pressure. The previous works provided the optimal H1-norm error estimates for all components, but not the optimal L2-norm estimates, which are caused by the nonlinear coupled terms. The optimal L2-norm error analysis is achieved through the novel Ritz and Stokes quasi-projections. In addition, the mass conservation and unconditional energy stability of the finite element convex-splitting scheme are ensured. Numerical examples are presented to validate the theoretical analysis.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs), such as DeepSeek R1,OpenAI o3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across logical inference, problem solving, and decision making. However, spatial reasoning:a fundamental component of human cognition that includes mental rotation, navigation, and spatial relationship comprehension remains a significant challenge for current advanced VLMs. We hypothesize that imagination, the internal simulation of spatial states, is the dominant reasoning mechanism within a spatial world model. To test this hypothesis and systematically probe current VLM spatial reasoning mechanisms, we introduce SpatiaLite, a fully synthetic benchmark that jointly measures spatial reasoning accuracy and reasoning efficiency. Comprehensive experiments reveal three key findings. First, advanced VLMs predominantly rely on linguistic representations for reasoning and imagination, resulting in significant deficiencies on visual centric tasks that demand perceptual spatial relations and 3D geometry transformations such as mental rotation or projection prediction. Second, advanced VLMs exhibit severe inefficiency in their current spatial reasoning mechanisms, with token usage growing rapidly as transformation complexity increases. Third, we propose an Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) for data synthesis and training, which can implicitly construct an internal world model that is critical for spatial reasoning in VLMs. Building on SpatiaLite, this work delineates the spatial reasoning limits and patterns of advanced VLMs, identifies key shortcomings, and informs future advances

Abstract: Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) offer a promising pathway for sustainable energy generation by converting organic matter into electricity through microbial processes. A key factor influencing MFC performance is the anode structure, where design and material properties play a crucial role. Existing predictive models struggle to capture the complex geometric dependencies necessary to optimize these structures. To solve this problem, we propose KANGURA: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-Based Geometry-Aware Learning with Unified Representation Attention. KANGURA introduces a new approach to three-dimensional (3D) machine learning modeling. It formulates prediction as a function decomposition problem, where Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)- based representation learning reconstructs geometric relationships without a conventional multi- layer perceptron (MLP). To refine spatial understanding, geometry-disentangled representation learning separates structural variations into interpretable components, while unified attention mechanisms dynamically enhance critical geometric regions. Experimental results demonstrate that KANGURA outperforms over 15 state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the ModelNet40 benchmark dataset, achieving 92.7% accuracy, and excels in a real-world MFC anode structure problem with 97% accuracy. This establishes KANGURA as a robust framework for 3D geometric modeling, unlocking new possibilities for optimizing complex structures in advanced manufacturing and quality-driven engineering applications.

Result: 假设1不支持（DDR与p53响应弱负相关，r=-0.40，p=0.76）；假设2中CDO1是明确异常值（r=0.70，p=0.0039），OGT仅弱关联；假设3的12基因特征一致性指数0.61（p=0.017）但效应大小不唯一。

Conclusion: AI科学家能产生有用想法，但需要严格的零模型审计，避免虚假发现。

Abstract: Agentic AI "scientists" now use language models to search the literature, run analyses, and generate hypotheses. We evaluate KOSMOS, an autonomous AI scientist, on three problems in radiation biology using simple random-gene null benchmarks. Hypothesis 1: baseline DNA damage response (DDR) capacity across cell lines predicts the p53 transcriptional response after irradiation (GSE30240). Hypothesis 2: baseline expression of OGT and CDO1 predicts the strength of repressed and induced radiation-response modules in breast cancer cells (GSE59732). Hypothesis 3: a 12-gene expression signature predicts biochemical recurrence-free survival after prostate radiotherapy plus androgen deprivation therapy (GSE116918). The DDR-p53 hypothesis was not supported: DDR score and p53 response were weakly negatively correlated (Spearman rho = -0.40, p = 0.76), indistinguishable from random five-gene scores. OGT showed only a weak association (r = 0.23, p = 0.34), whereas CDO1 was a clear outlier (r = 0.70, empirical p = 0.0039). The 12-gene signature achieved a concordance index of 0.61 (p = 0.017) but a non-unique effect size. Overall, KOSMOS produced one well-supported discovery, one plausible but uncertain result, and one false hypothesis, illustrating that AI scientists can generate useful ideas but require rigorous auditing against appropriate null models.

Result: 开发了适用于半马尔可夫结构因果模型的扩展方法，能够处理外生变量影响多个内生变量的情况。

Conclusion: 成功将分治算法扩展到半马尔可夫模型，为处理更复杂的因果推理问题提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Recently, Bjøru et al. proposed a novel divide-and-conquer algorithm for bounding counterfactual probabilities in structural causal models (SCMs). They assumed that the SCMs were learned from purely observational data, leading to an imprecise characterization of the marginal distributions of exogenous variables. Their method leveraged the canonical representation of structural equations to decompose a general SCM with high-cardinality exogenous variables into a set of sub-models with low-cardinality exogenous variables. These sub-models had precise marginals over the exogenous variables and therefore admitted efficient exact inference. The aggregated results were used to bound counterfactual probabilities in the original model. The approach was developed for Markovian models, where each exogenous variable affects only a single endogenous variable. In this paper, we investigate extending the methodology to \textit{semi-Markovian} SCMs, where exogenous variables may influence multiple endogenous variables. Such models are capable of representing confounding relationships that Markovian models cannot. We illustrate the challenges of this extension using a minimal example, which motivates a set of alternative solution strategies. These strategies are evaluated both theoretically and through a computational study.

Conclusion: LVLMs在智能交通系统中存在严重安全风险，图像排版操纵和多轮提示的越狱攻击威胁巨大，需要部署有效的防御机制来保障系统安全。

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in multimodal reasoning and many real-world applications, such as visual question answering. However, LVLMs are highly vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks. This paper systematically analyzes the vulnerabilities of LVLMs integrated in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) under carefully crafted jailbreaking attacks. First, we carefully construct a dataset with harmful queries relevant to transportation, following OpenAI's prohibited categories to which the LVLMs should not respond. Second, we introduce a novel jailbreaking attack that exploits the vulnerabilities of LVLMs through image typography manipulation and multi-turn prompting. Third, we propose a multi-layered response filtering defense technique to prevent the model from generating inappropriate responses. We perform extensive experiments with the proposed attack and defense on the state-of-the-art LVLMs (both open-source and closed-source). To evaluate the attack method and defense technique, we use GPT-4's judgment to determine the toxicity score of the generated responses, as well as manual verification. Further, we compare our proposed jailbreaking method with existing jailbreaking techniques and highlight severe security risks involved with jailbreaking attacks with image typography manipulation and multi-turn prompting in the LVLMs integrated in ITS.

*Daniel Weitekamp*

TL;DR: CORGI是一种新的模式匹配算法，为实时AI系统和数据库查询提供二次时间和空间保证，避免RETE算法在最坏情况下的指数级内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于规则的系统在实时应用中遇到的指数级时间和空间消耗问题，特别是当AI系统自动生成规则时容易产生最坏情况匹配模式，导致程序执行缓慢或内存溢出。

Method: 采用两步法：前向传递构建/维护接地关系图，后向迭代器按需生成匹配，避免传统RETE算法中β内存收集部分匹配的问题。

Result: 在性能评估中，CORGI在简单组合匹配任务上显著优于SOAR和OPS5的RETE实现。

Conclusion: CORGI通过消除填充完整冲突集导致的高延迟和内存溢出，使基于规则的系统在实际应用中更加可行，无需手动工程约束或面临不可预测的故障模式。

Abstract: Rule-based systems must solve complex matching problems within tight time constraints to be effective in real-time applications, such as planning and reactive control for AI agents, as well as low-latency relational database querying. Pattern-matching systems can encounter issues where exponential time and space are required to find matches for rules with many underconstrained variables, or which produce combinatorial intermediate partial matches (but are otherwise well-constrained). When online AI systems automatically generate rules from example-driven induction or code synthesis, they can easily produce worst-case matching patterns that slow or halt program execution by exceeding available memory. In our own work with cognitive systems that learn from example, we've found that aggressive forms of anti-unification-based generalization can easily produce these circumstances. To make these systems practical without hand-engineering constraints or succumbing to unpredictable failure modes, we introduce a new matching algorithm called CORGI (Collection-Oriented Relational Graph Iteration). Unlike RETE-based approaches, CORGI offers quadratic time and space guarantees for finding single satisficing matches, and the ability to iteratively stream subsequent matches without committing entire conflict sets to memory. CORGI differs from RETE in that it does not have a traditional $β$-memory for collecting partial matches. Instead, CORGI takes a two-step approach: a graph of grounded relations is built/maintained in a forward pass, and an iterator generates matches as needed by working backward through the graph. This approach eliminates the high-latency delays and memory overflows that can result from populating full conflict sets. In a performance evaluation, we demonstrate that CORGI significantly outperforms RETE implementations from SOAR and OPS5 on a simple combinatorial matching task.

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效生成逼真的工作场所危险场景图像，为训练视觉模型提供可行的数据解决方案。

Abstract: Training vision models to detect workplace hazards accurately requires realistic images of unsafe conditions that could lead to accidents. However, acquiring such datasets is difficult because capturing accident-triggering scenarios as they occur is nearly impossible. To overcome this limitation, this study presents a novel scene graph-guided generative AI framework that synthesizes photorealistic images of hazardous scenarios grounded in historical Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) accident reports. OSHA narratives are analyzed using GPT-4o to extract structured hazard reasoning, which is converted into object-level scene graphs capturing spatial and contextual relationships essential for understanding risk. These graphs guide a text-to-image diffusion model to generate compositionally accurate hazard scenes. To evaluate the realism and semantic fidelity of the generated data, a visual question answering (VQA) framework is introduced. Across four state-of-the-art generative models, the proposed VQA Graph Score outperforms CLIP and BLIP metrics based on entropy-based validation, confirming its higher discriminative sensitivity.

Abstract: This paper presents an integrative review and experimental validation of artificial intelligence (AI) agents applied to music analysis and education. We synthesize the historical evolution from rule-based models to contemporary approaches involving deep learning, multi-agent architectures, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks. The pedagogical implications are evaluated through a dual-case methodology: (1) the use of generative AI platforms in secondary education to foster analytical and creative skills; (2) the design of a multiagent system for symbolic music analysis, enabling modular, scalable, and explainable workflows.
  Experimental results demonstrate that AI agents effectively enhance musical pattern recognition, compositional parameterization, and educational feedback, outperforming traditional automated methods in terms of interpretability and adaptability. The findings highlight key challenges concerning transparency, cultural bias, and the definition of hybrid evaluation metrics, emphasizing the need for responsible deployment of AI in educational environments.
  This research contributes to a unified framework that bridges technical, pedagogical, and ethical considerations, offering evidence-based guidance for the design and application of intelligent agents in computational musicology and music education.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型中的知识是静态的，难以适应不断变化的信息，现有方法在处理需要多步推理的复杂多跳问题时面临可扩展性和检索效率的挑战。

Method: ALEX采用分层内存架构组织知识更新，包含推理查询合成模块来弥合查询与事实之间的语义差距，以及动态证据裁决引擎执行高效的两阶段检索过程。

Result: 在MQUAKE基准测试中，ALEX显著提高了多跳答案的准确性和推理路径的可靠性，同时将所需搜索空间减少了80%以上。

Conclusion: ALEX为构建可扩展、高效和准确的知识编辑系统提供了一条有前景的路径。

Abstract: The static nature of knowledge within Large Language Models (LLMs) makes it difficult for them to adapt to evolving information, rendering knowledge editing a critical task. However, existing methods struggle with challenges of scalability and retrieval efficiency, particularly when handling complex, multi-hop questions that require multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ALEX (A Light Editing-knowledge Extractor), a lightweight knowledge editing framework. The core innovation of ALEX is its hierarchical memory architecture, which organizes knowledge updates (edits) into semantic clusters. This design fundamentally reduces retrieval complexity from a linear O(N) to a highly scalable O(K+N/C). Furthermore, the framework integrates an Inferential Query Synthesis (IQS) module to bridge the semantic gap between queries and facts , and a Dynamic Evidence Adjudication (DEA) engine that executes an efficient two-stage retrieval process. Experiments on the MQUAKE benchmark demonstrate that ALEX significantly improves both the accuracy of multi-hop answers (MultiHop-ACC) and the reliability of reasoning paths (HopWise-ACC). It also reduces the required search space by over 80% , presenting a promising path toward building scalable, efficient, and accurate knowledge editing systems.

TL;DR: 开发了Syn-STARTS框架，使用LLM生成大规模分类案例，验证了合成数据在医疗紧急情况下开发高性能AI模型的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模伤亡事件中分类决策至关重要，但真实数据难以收集，需要高质量基准数据集来开发AI模型。

Method: 使用LLM生成分类案例的Syn-STARTS框架，并与手动整理的TRIAGE开放数据集进行质量对比。

Result: 生成的分类案例在质量上与手动整理的数据集无法区分，且在标准START分类法的四个类别中表现出高度稳定性。

Conclusion: 合成数据在严重和关键医疗情况下开发高性能AI模型具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Triage is a critically important decision-making process in mass casualty incidents (MCIs) to maximize victim survival rates. While the role of AI in such situations is gaining attention for making optimal decisions within limited resources and time, its development and performance evaluation require benchmark datasets of sufficient quantity and quality. However, MCIs occur infrequently, and sufficient records are difficult to accumulate at the scene, making it challenging to collect large-scale realworld data for research use. Therefore, we developed Syn-STARTS, a framework that uses LLMs to generate triage cases, and verified its effectiveness. The results showed that the triage cases generated by Syn-STARTS were qualitatively indistinguishable from the TRIAGE open dataset generated by manual curation from training materials. Furthermore, when evaluating the LLM accuracy using hundreds of cases each from the green, yellow, red, and black categories defined by the standard triage method START, the results were found to be highly stable. This strongly indicates the possibility of synthetic data in developing high-performance AI models for severe and critical medical situations.

Conclusion: AISAC提供了一个可配置、透明且可追溯的科学工作流系统原型，能够适应不同的科学研究需求，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: AI Scientific Assistant Core (AISAC) is an integrated multi-agent system developed at Argonne National Laboratory for scientific and engineering workflows. AISAC builds on established technologies - LangGraph for orchestration, FAISS for vector search, and SQLite for persistence - and integrates them into a unified system prototype focused on transparency, provenance tracking, and scientific adaptability.
  The system implements a Router-Planner-Coordinator workflow and an optional Evaluator role, using prompt-engineered agents coordinated via LangGraph's StateGraph and supported by helper agents such as a Researcher. Each role is defined through custom system prompts that enforce structured JSON outputs. A hybrid memory approach (FAISS + SQLite) enables both semantic retrieval and structured conversation history. An incremental indexing strategy based on file hashing minimizes redundant re-embedding when scientific corpora evolve. A configuration-driven project bootstrap layer allows research teams to customize tools, prompts, and data sources without modifying core code.
  All agent decisions, tool invocations, and retrievals are logged and visualized through a custom Gradio interface, providing step-by-step transparency for each reasoning episode. The authors have applied AISAC to multiple research areas at Argonne, including specialized deployments for waste-to-products research and energy process safety, as well as general-purpose scientific assistance, demonstrating its cross-domain applicability.

Conclusion: 开发了一个可追踪和可审计的控制器，能够实现公平、负载感知的个性化教学，在课堂规模上有效闭合诊断与教学之间的循环。

Abstract: Adaptive learning often diagnoses precisely yet intervenes weakly, yielding help that is mistimed or misaligned. This study presents evidence supporting an instructor-governed feedback loop that converts concept-level assessment evidence into vetted micro-interventions. The adaptive learning algorithm contains three safeguards: adequacy as a hard guarantee of gap closure, attention as a budgeted constraint for time and redundancy, and diversity as protection against overfitting to a single resource. We formalize intervention assignment as a binary integer program with constraints for coverage, time, difficulty windows informed by ability estimates, prerequisites encoded by a concept matrix, and anti-redundancy enforced through diversity. Greedy selection serves low-richness and tight-latency regimes, gradient-based relaxation serves rich repositories, and a hybrid method transitions along a richness-latency frontier. In simulation and in an introductory physics deployment with one thousand two hundred four students, both solvers achieved full skill coverage for essentially all learners within bounded watch time. The gradient-based method reduced redundant coverage by approximately twelve percentage points relative to greedy and harmonized difficulty across slates, while greedy delivered comparable adequacy with lower computational cost in scarce settings. Slack variables localized missing content and supported targeted curation, sustaining sufficiency across subgroups. The result is a tractable and auditable controller that closes the diagnostic-pedagogical loop and delivers equitable, load-aware personalization at classroom scale.

Conclusion: LLM网络中的幻觉传播是一个重要问题，需要综合考虑网络结构、激励机制和节点特性来管理幻觉扩散，为构建可靠的协作LLM系统提供理论基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we model and analyze how a network of interacting LLMs performs collaborative question-answering (CQA) in order to estimate a ground truth given a distributed set of documents. This problem is interesting because LLMs often hallucinate when direct evidence to answer a question is lacking, and these effects become more pronounced in a network of interacting LLMs. The hallucination spreads, causing previously accurate LLMs to hallucinate. We study interacting LLMs and their hallucination by combining novel ideas of mean-field dynamics (MFD) from network science and the randomized utility model from economics to construct a useful generative model. We model the LLM with a latent state that indicates if it is truthful or not with respect to the ground truth, and extend a tractable analytical model considering an MFD to model the diffusion of information in a directed network of LLMs. To specify the probabilities that govern the dynamics of the MFD, we propose a randomized utility model. For a network of LLMs, where each LLM has two possible latent states, we posit sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point and analyze the behavior of the fixed point in terms of the incentive (e.g., test-time compute) given to individual LLMs. We experimentally study and analyze the behavior of a network of $100$ open-source LLMs with respect to data heterogeneity, node capability, network structure, and sensitivity to framing on multiple semi-synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: 该工作充分利用了大模型驱动的多智能体系统的自动协作能力，能够有效自动化移动应用页面设计过程。

Abstract: Layout design is a crucial step in developing mobile app pages. However, crafting satisfactory designs is time-intensive for designers: they need to consider which controls and content to present on the page, and then repeatedly adjust their size, position, and style for better aesthetics and structure. Although many design software can now help to perform these repetitive tasks, extensive training is needed to use them effectively. Moreover, collaborative design across app pages demands extra time to align standards and ensure consistent styling. In this work, we propose APD-agents, a large language model (LLM) driven multi-agent framework for automated page design in mobile applications. Our framework contains OrchestratorAgent, SemanticParserAgent, PrimaryLayoutAgent, TemplateRetrievalAgent, and RecursiveComponentAgent. Upon receiving the user's description of the page, the OrchestratorAgent can dynamically can direct other agents to accomplish users' design task. To be specific, the SemanticParserAgent is responsible for converting users' descriptions of page content into structured data. The PrimaryLayoutAgent can generate an initial coarse-grained layout of this page. The TemplateRetrievalAgent can fetch semantically relevant few-shot examples and enhance the quality of layout generation. Besides, a RecursiveComponentAgent can be used to decide how to recursively generate all the fine-grained sub-elements it contains for each element in the layout. Our work fully leverages the automatic collaboration capabilities of large-model-driven multi-agent systems. Experimental results on the RICO dataset show that our APD-agents achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: PRISM的模块化、仅推理设计使其适用于实际应用场景，为金融信息检索提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), financial information retrieval has become a critical industrial application. Extracting task-relevant information from lengthy financial filings is essential for both operational and analytical decision-making. The FinAgentBench dataset formalizes this problem through two tasks: document ranking and chunk ranking. We present PRISM, a training-free framework that integrates refined system prompting, in-context learning (ICL), and a lightweight multi-agent system. Each component is examined extensively to reveal their synergies: prompt engineering provides precise task instructions, ICL supplies semantically relevant few-shot examples, and the multi-agent system models coordinated scoring behaviour. Our best configuration achieves an NDCG@5 of 0.71818 on the restricted validation split. We further demonstrate that PRISM is feasible and robust for production-scale financial retrieval. Its modular, inference-only design makes it practical for real-world use cases. The source code is released at https://bit.ly/prism-ailens.

Result: 在REVERIE基准测试中，SPL和RGSPL分别超过最先进方法3.28%和3.30%。

Conclusion: R3框架能有效处理具有挑战性的视觉语言导航任务，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to dynamically explore complex 3D environments following human instructions. Recent research underscores the potential of harnessing large language models (LLMs) for VLN, given their commonsense knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. Despite their strengths, a substantial gap in task completion performance persists between LLM-based approaches and domain experts, as LLMs inherently struggle to comprehend real-world spatial correlations precisely. Additionally, introducing LLMs is accompanied with substantial computational cost and inference latency. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-process thinking framework dubbed R3, integrating LLMs' generalization capabilities with VLN-specific expertise in a zero-shot manner. The framework comprises three core modules: Runner, Ruminator, and Regulator. The Runner is a lightweight transformer-based expert model that ensures efficient and accurate navigation under regular circumstances. The Ruminator employs a powerful multimodal LLM as the backbone and adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to elicit structured reasoning. The Regulator monitors the navigation progress and controls the appropriate thinking mode according to three criteria, integrating Runner and Ruminator harmoniously. Experimental results illustrate that R3 significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, exceeding 3.28% and 3.30% in SPL and RGSPL respectively on the REVERIE benchmark. This pronounced enhancement highlights the effectiveness of our method in handling challenging VLN tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了CLEAR评估框架，针对企业AI代理部署中的成本效率、可靠性和运营稳定性等关键需求，弥补了现有基准测试只关注任务完成准确性的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI代理基准测试主要评估任务完成准确性，但忽视了企业部署的关键需求，如成本效率、可靠性和运营稳定性。研究发现现有基准存在三个根本限制：缺乏成本控制评估、可靠性评估不足、缺少多维指标。

Method: 提出了CLEAR（成本、延迟、效能、保障、可靠性）评估框架，专门为企业部署设计。通过对12个主要基准的系统分析和6个领先代理在300个企业任务上的实证评估。

Result: 评估显示仅优化准确性的代理比成本感知替代方案贵4.4-10.8倍，但性能相当。专家评估（N=15）证实CLEAR能更好预测生产成功（相关性ρ=0.83），而仅准确性评估的相关性为ρ=0.41。

Conclusion: CLEAR框架为企业AI代理部署提供了更全面的评估标准，显著优于仅关注准确性的传统方法，能更好预测实际生产环境中的成功。

Abstract: Current agentic AI benchmarks predominantly evaluate task completion accuracy, while overlooking critical enterprise requirements such as cost-efficiency, reliability, and operational stability. Through systematic analysis of 12 main benchmarks and empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art agents, we identify three fundamental limitations: (1) absence of cost-controlled evaluation leading to 50x cost variations for similar precision, (2) inadequate reliability assessment where agent performance drops from 60\% (single run) to 25\% (8-run consistency), and (3) missing multidimensional metrics for security, latency, and policy compliance. We propose \textbf{CLEAR} (Cost, Latency, Efficacy, Assurance, Reliability), a holistic evaluation framework specifically designed for enterprise deployment. Evaluation of six leading agents on 300 enterprise tasks demonstrates that optimizing for accuracy alone yields agents 4.4-10.8x more expensive than cost-aware alternatives with comparable performance. Expert evaluation (N=15) confirms that CLEAR better predicts production success (correlation $ρ=0.83$) compared to accuracy-only evaluation ($ρ=0.41$).

TL;DR: HFL-FlowLLM是首个将大语言模型应用于异构联邦学习网络流量分类的框架，相比现有方法平均F1分数提升约13%，训练成本降低约87%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G和物联网驱动的现代通信网络中，传统集中式机器学习难以处理分布式数据和隐私问题，现有联邦学习方法成本高且泛化能力差。

Method: 提出HFL-FlowLLM框架，将大语言模型应用于异构联邦学习环境下的网络流量分类。

Result: 相比最先进的异构联邦学习方法，平均F1分数提升约13%；相比现有大语言模型联邦学习框架，在增加参与客户端数量时，平均F1分数提升达5%，训练成本降低约87%。

Conclusion: HFL-FlowLLM在现代通信网络安全中展现出巨大潜力和实用价值。

Abstract: In modern communication networks driven by 5G and the Internet of Things (IoT), effective network traffic flow classification is crucial for Quality of Service (QoS) management and security. Traditional centralized machine learning struggles with the distributed data and privacy concerns in these heterogeneous environments, while existing federated learning approaches suffer from high costs and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose HFL-FlowLLM, which to our knowledge is the first framework to apply large language models to network traffic flow classification in heterogeneous federated learning. Compared to state-of-the-art heterogeneous federated learning methods for network traffic flow classification, the proposed approach improves the average F1 score by approximately 13%, demonstrating compelling performance and strong robustness. When compared to existing large language models federated learning frameworks, as the number of clients participating in each training round increases, the proposed method achieves up to a 5% improvement in average F1 score while reducing the training costs by about 87%. These findings prove the potential and practical value of HFL-FlowLLM in modern communication networks security.

TL;DR: LLMs在金融应用中存在时间顺序理解问题，测试显示模型在处理长序列时全局时间线一致性差，但增加推理预算能显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试LLMs是否真正理解时间顺序，这对金融应用中避免前瞻性偏差至关重要

Method: 设计三种时间顺序任务：时间排序、条件排序（先过滤后排序）、时代错误检测，在多个模型和推理设置下评估

Result: 模型在长序列中精确匹配率显著下降，但排名相关性保持较高；条件排序失败主要来自过滤步骤；时代错误检测是最简单任务；增加推理预算能显著改善性能

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在时间顺序任务上存在局限性，但通过增加推理预算可以显著提升性能，这对金融实时应用具有重要意义

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in finance and economics, where prompt-based attempts against look-ahead bias implicitly assume that models understand chronology. We test this fundamental question with a series of chronological ordering tasks with increasing complexities over facts the model already knows from pre-training. Our tasks cover (1) chronological ordering, (2) conditional sorting (filter, then order), and (3) anachronism detection. We evaluate GPT-4.1, Claude-3.7 Sonnet, with and without Extended Thinking (ET), and GPT-5 across multiple reasoning-effort settings. Across models, Exact match rate drops sharply as sequences lengthen even while rank correlations stay high as LLMs largely preserve local order but struggle to maintain a single globally consistent timeline. In conditional sorting, most failures stem from the filtering step rather than the ordering step, but GPT-5 and Claude-3.7 Sonnet with Extended Thinking outshine normal models significantly. Lastly, anachronism detection is found to be the easiest task for the LLMs but performance still declines with increasingly overlapping timelines or entities. Overall, our main contribution is showing that allocating explicit reasoning budget helps with chronological ordering with GPT-5 at medium/high reasoning effort achieving flawless ordering at all lengths and perfect conditional sorting (both self-filtered and given-subset), whereas low/minimal effort degrades with longer lists, mirroring earlier models. Our findings delineate limits of current LLMs on chronological tasks, providing insights into task complexity, and demonstrate scenarios in which reasoning helps. These patterns are important for the real-time application of LLMs in finance. We release all code and evaluation templates to support full reproducibility.

TL;DR: 提出两阶段架构来减少Whisper模型的幻觉错误：第一阶段通过自适应层注意力增强编码器鲁棒性，第二阶段使用多目标知识蒸馏抑制幻觉


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whisper模型在噪声条件下经常出现幻觉错误，现有方法主要关注音频预处理或转录后处理，而直接修改Whisper模型本身来缓解幻觉的研究较少

Method: 1. 自适应层注意力(ALA)：通过层间相关性分析将编码器层分组为语义连贯块，使用可学习多头注意力融合块表示；2. 多目标知识蒸馏(KD)：在噪声音频上训练学生模型，使其语义和注意力分布与处理干净输入的教师模型对齐

Result: 在噪声语音基准测试中显著减少了幻觉和词错误率，同时保持了在干净语音上的性能

Conclusion: ALA和KD为在真实世界噪声条件下提高Whisper的可靠性提供了原则性策略

Abstract: The Whisper model, an open-source automatic speech recognition system, is widely adopted for its strong performance across multilingual and zero-shot settings. However, it frequently suffers from hallucination errors, especially under noisy acoustic conditions. Previous works to reduce hallucinations in Whisper-style ASR systems have primarily focused on audio preprocessing or post-processing of transcriptions to filter out erroneous content. However, modifications to the Whisper model itself remain largely unexplored to mitigate hallucinations directly. To address this challenge, we present a two-stage architecture that first enhances encoder robustness through Adaptive Layer Attention (ALA) and further suppresses hallucinations using a multi-objective knowledge distillation (KD) framework. In the first stage, ALA groups encoder layers into semantically coherent blocks via inter-layer correlation analysis. A learnable multi-head attention module then fuses these block representations, enabling the model to jointly exploit low- and high-level features for more robust encoding. In the second stage, our KD framework trains the student model on noisy audio to align its semantic and attention distributions with a teacher model processing clean inputs. Our experiments on noisy speech benchmarks show notable reductions in hallucinations and word error rates, while preserving performance on clean speech. Together, ALA and KD offer a principled strategy to improve Whisper's reliability under real-world noisy conditions.

Abstract: Operation recommendation for IoT devices refers to generating personalized device operations for users based on their context, such as historical operations, environment information, and device status. This task is crucial for enhancing user satisfaction and corporate profits. Existing recommendation models struggle with complex operation logic, diverse user preferences, and sensitive to suboptimal suggestions, limiting their applicability to IoT device operations. To address these issues, we propose DevPiolt, a LLM-based recommendation model for IoT device operations. Specifically, we first equip the LLM with fundamental domain knowledge of IoT operations via continual pre-training and multi-task fine-tuning. Then, we employ direct preference optimization to align the fine-tuned LLM with specific user preferences. Finally, we design a confidence-based exposure control mechanism to avoid negative user experiences from low-quality recommendations. Extensive experiments show that DevPiolt significantly outperforms baselines on all datasets, with an average improvement of 69.5% across all metrics. DevPiolt has been practically deployed in Xiaomi Home app for one quarter, providing daily operation recommendations to 255,000 users. Online experiment results indicate a 21.6% increase in unique visitor device coverage and a 29.1% increase in page view acceptance rates.

Abstract: The expansion of short-term rental platforms, such as Airbnb, has significantly disrupted local housing markets, often leading to increased rental prices and housing affordability issues. Accurately forecasting regional Airbnb market trends can thus offer critical insights for policymakers and urban planners aiming to mitigate these impacts. This study proposes a novel time-series forecasting framework to predict three key Airbnb indicators -- Revenue, Reservation Days, and Number of Reservations -- at the regional level. Using a sliding-window approach, the model forecasts trends 1 to 3 months ahead. Unlike prior studies that focus on individual listings at fixed time points, our approach constructs regional representations by integrating listing features with external contextual factors such as urban accessibility and human mobility. We convert structured tabular data into prompt-based inputs for a Large Language Model (LLM), producing comprehensive regional embeddings. These embeddings are then fed into advanced time-series models (RNN, LSTM, Transformer) to better capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Experiments on Seoul's Airbnb dataset show that our method reduces both average RMSE and MAE by approximately 48% compared to conventional baselines, including traditional statistical and machine learning models. Our framework not only improves forecasting accuracy but also offers practical insights for detecting oversupplied regions and supporting data-driven urban policy decisions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PathMind是一个增强知识图谱推理的框架，通过选择性引导LLM关注重要推理路径，解决现有方法中路径提取无差别和检索需求高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的知识图谱推理方法存在两个关键局限：一是无差别提取推理路径可能引入无关噪声误导LLM；二是动态探索推理路径需要高检索需求和频繁LLM调用。

Method: 采用"检索-优先化-推理"范式：首先检索查询子图，然后通过语义感知路径优先级函数识别重要推理路径，最后通过双阶段训练策略生成准确响应。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，PathMind始终优于竞争基线，特别是在复杂推理任务上，通过识别关键推理路径实现更少输入token下的更好性能。

Conclusion: PathMind通过选择性路径引导有效提升了知识图谱推理的忠实性和可解释性，在复杂推理任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) is the task of inferring new knowledge by performing logical deductions on knowledge graphs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks. Despite promising success, current LLM-based KGR methods still face two critical limitations. First, existing methods often extract reasoning paths indiscriminately, without assessing their different importance, which may introduce irrelevant noise that misleads LLMs. Second, while many methods leverage LLMs to dynamically explore potential reasoning paths, they require high retrieval demands and frequent LLM calls. To address these limitations, we propose PathMind, a novel framework designed to enhance faithful and interpretable reasoning by selectively guiding LLMs with important reasoning paths. Specifically, PathMind follows a "Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason" paradigm. First, it retrieves a query subgraph from KG through the retrieval module. Next, it introduces a path prioritization mechanism that identifies important reasoning paths using a semantic-aware path priority function, which simultaneously considers the accumulative cost and the estimated future cost for reaching the target. Finally, PathMind generates accurate and logically consistent responses via a dual-phase training strategy, including task-specific instruction tuning and path-wise preference alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PathMind consistently outperforms competitive baselines, particularly on complex reasoning tasks with fewer input tokens, by identifying essential reasoning paths.

Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的数据洞察代理存在三个主要问题：领域知识利用不足、分析深度不够、代码生成容易出错，这些问题限制了自动化数据洞察的效果。

Method: 提出DataSage框架，包含三个创新特性：外部知识检索丰富分析上下文、多角色辩论机制模拟不同分析视角、多路径推理提高代码和洞察的准确性。

Result: 在InsightBench上的广泛实验表明，DataSage在所有难度级别上都优于现有的数据洞察代理。

Conclusion: DataSage为自动化数据洞察发现提供了一个有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In today's data-driven era, fully automated end-to-end data analytics, particularly insight discovery, is critical for discovering actionable insights that assist organizations in making effective decisions. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), LLM-driven agents have emerged as a promising paradigm for automating data analysis and insight discovery. However, existing data insight agents remain limited in several key aspects, often failing to deliver satisfactory results due to: (1) insufficient utilization of domain knowledge, (2) shallow analytical depth, and (3) error-prone code generation during insight generation. To address these issues, we propose DataSage, a novel multi-agent framework that incorporates three innovative features including external knowledge retrieval to enrich the analytical context, a multi-role debating mechanism to simulate diverse analytical perspectives and deepen analytical depth, and multi-path reasoning to improve the accuracy of the generated code and insights. Extensive experiments on InsightBench demonstrate that DataSage consistently outperforms existing data insight agents across all difficulty levels, offering an effective solution for automated data insight discovery.

*Alessio Pellegrino,Jacopo Mauro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs在自动生成优化问题模型时，其成功可能源于训练数据污染而非真正推理能力。通过对CSPLib问题重新表述和扰动测试，发现LLMs在上下文和语言变化下性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检验LLMs自动生成优化模型的能力是否真正基于推理，还是仅仅因为训练数据中包含了标准问题。

Method: 系统性地重新表述和扰动一组知名CSPLib问题，保持结构不变但修改上下文并引入误导元素，比较三个代表性LLM在原始和修改描述下的模型生成表现。

Result: LLMs能生成语法有效且语义合理的模型，但在上下文和语言变化下性能急剧下降，显示出浅层理解和对措辞的敏感性。

Conclusion: LLMs在自动模型生成方面的能力可能被高估，其表现更多依赖于训练数据中的模式匹配而非真正的推理理解。

Abstract: One of the long-standing goals in optimisation and constraint programming is to describe a problem in natural language and automatically obtain an executable, efficient model. Large language models appear to bring this vision closer, showing impressive results in automatically generating models for classical benchmarks. However, much of this apparent success may derive from data contamination rather than genuine reasoning: many standard CP problems are likely included in the training data of these models. To examine this hypothesis, we systematically rephrased and perturbed a set of well-known CSPLib problems to preserve their structure while modifying their context and introducing misleading elements. We then compared the models produced by three representative LLMs across original and modified descriptions. Our qualitative analysis shows that while LLMs can produce syntactically valid and semantically plausible models, their performance drops sharply under contextual and linguistic variation, revealing shallow understanding and sensitivity to wording.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM对齐决策往往忽视人类社会的多样性，本研究旨在探索如何通过纳入多元价值观来改进对齐过程。

Method: 收集来自美国和德国参与者的27,375个评分，在毒性、情感意识、敏感性、刻板印象偏见和帮助性五个维度上评估LLM响应。使用不同社会群体的偏好微调多个大型语言模型和推理模型，同时改变评分尺度、分歧处理方法和优化技术。

Result: 发现系统性人口统计效应：男性参与者对毒性的评分比女性低18%；保守派和黑人参与者对情感意识的评分分别比自由派和白人参与者高27.9%和44%。技术设计选择影响显著：保留评分者分歧比多数投票减少毒性约53%；5点量表比二元格式减少约22%；DPO在多值优化中始终优于GRPO。

Conclusion: 这些发现为回答关键问题提供了初步步骤：对齐应如何平衡专家驱动和用户驱动的信号，以确保安全性和公平代表性。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained using human feedback for safety and alignment with human values, alignment decisions often overlook human social diversity. This study examines how incorporating pluralistic values affects LLM behavior by systematically evaluating demographic variation and design parameters in the alignment pipeline. We collected alignment data from US and German participants (N = 1,095, 27,375 ratings) who rated LLM responses across five dimensions: Toxicity, Emotional Awareness (EA), Sensitivity, Stereotypical Bias, and Helpfulness. We fine-tuned multiple Large Language Models and Large Reasoning Models using preferences from different social groups while varying rating scales, disagreement handling methods, and optimization techniques. The results revealed systematic demographic effects: male participants rated responses 18% less toxic than female participants; conservative and Black participants rated responses 27.9% and 44% more emotionally aware than liberal and White participants, respectively. Models fine-tuned on group-specific preferences exhibited distinct behaviors. Technical design choices showed strong effects: the preservation of rater disagreement achieved roughly 53% greater toxicity reduction than majority voting, and 5-point scales yielded about 22% more reduction than binary formats; and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) consistently outperformed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in multi-value optimization. These findings represent a preliminary step in answering a critical question: How should alignment balance expert-driven and user-driven signals to ensure both safety and fair representation?

TL;DR: 提出了一个神经符号框架，通过显式建模和传播从感知到规划的不确定性，将连续感知信号与离散符号推理连接起来。该框架在桌面机器人操作任务中表现出色，在多个基准测试中超过最强POMDP基线10-14个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥合连续感知信号和离散符号推理之间的鸿沟是AI系统在不确定性下运行时的基本挑战，需要建立感知和规划两个抽象层次之间的原则性连接。

Method: 结合基于transformer的感知前端和图神经网络关系推理，从视觉观察中提取概率符号状态，并使用不确定性感知的符号规划器在置信度低时主动收集信息。

Result: 在10,047个PyBullet生成的场景（3-10个物体）上处理，输出具有校准置信度的概率谓词（总体F1=0.68）。在规划器中嵌入后，在Simple Stack、Deep Stack和Clear+Stack基准测试中分别达到94%/90%/88%的成功率（平均90.7%），比最强POMDP基线高出10-14个百分点，规划时间在15毫秒内。

Conclusion: 该框架建立了校准不确定性与规划收敛之间的定量联系，提供了理论保证并通过实证验证。该框架是通用的，可应用于任何需要从感知输入到符号规划的不确定性感知推理的领域。

Abstract: Bridging continuous perceptual signals and discrete symbolic reasoning is a fundamental challenge in AI systems that must operate under uncertainty. We present a neuro-symbolic framework that explicitly models and propagates uncertainty from perception to planning, providing a principled connection between these two abstraction levels. Our approach couples a transformer-based perceptual front-end with graph neural network (GNN) relational reasoning to extract probabilistic symbolic states from visual observations, and an uncertainty-aware symbolic planner that actively gathers information when confidence is low. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on tabletop robotic manipulation as a concrete application: the translator processes 10,047 PyBullet-generated scenes (3--10 objects) and outputs probabilistic predicates with calibrated confidences (overall F1=0.68). When embedded in the planner, the system achieves 94\%/90\%/88\% success on Simple Stack, Deep Stack, and Clear+Stack benchmarks (90.7\% average), exceeding the strongest POMDP baseline by 10--14 points while planning within 15\,ms. A probabilistic graphical-model analysis establishes a quantitative link between calibrated uncertainty and planning convergence, providing theoretical guarantees that are validated empirically. The framework is general-purpose and can be applied to any domain requiring uncertainty-aware reasoning from perceptual input to symbolic planning.

Conclusion: 为个性化教育和AI辅助教育中的信息论知识图谱优化建立了理论基础

Abstract: Task-oriented knowledge graphs (KGs) enable AI-powered learning assistant systems to automatically generate high-quality multiple-choice questions (MCQs). Yet converting unstructured educational materials, such as lecture notes and slides, into KGs that capture key pedagogical content remains difficult. We propose a framework for knowledge graph construction and refinement grounded in rate-distortion (RD) theory and optimal transport geometry. In the framework, lecture content is modeled as a metric-measure space, capturing semantic and relational structure, while candidate KGs are aligned using Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) couplings to quantify semantic distortion. The rate term, expressed via the size of KG, reflects complexity and compactness. Refinement operators (add, merge, split, remove, rewire) minimize the rate-distortion Lagrangian, yielding compact, information-preserving KGs. Our prototype applied to data science lectures yields interpretable RD curves and shows that MCQs generated from refined KGs consistently surpass those from raw notes on fifteen quality criteria. This study establishes a principled foundation for information-theoretic KG optimization in personalized and AI-assisted education.

Motivation: 当前LLM代理框架在工具选择时存在高推理成本问题，特别是像ReAct这样需要反复调用LLM来确定每个步骤使用哪个工具的方法

Method: 构建基于历史代理轨迹的有向图，节点表示工具，边捕获转移概率，建模工具选择惯性，并集成参数级信息来优化工具输入生成

Result: 在多样化代理任务上的实验表明，AutoTool将推理成本降低了高达30%，同时保持了有竞争力的任务完成率

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了将统计结构整合到LLM代理设计中的潜力，可在不牺牲性能的情况下实现更高的效率

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have emerged as powerful tools for automating complex tasks by leveraging the reasoning and decision-making abilities of LLMs. However, a major bottleneck in current agent frameworks lies in the high inference cost of tool selection, especially in approaches like ReAct that repeatedly invoke the LLM to determine which tool to use at each step. In this work, we propose AutoTool, a novel graph-based framework that bypasses repeated LLM inference by exploiting a key empirical observation: tool usage inertia - the tendency of tool invocations to follow predictable sequential patterns. AutoTool constructs a directed graph from historical agent trajectories, where nodes represent tools and edges capture transition probabilities, effectively modeling the inertia in tool selection. It further integrates parameter-level information to refine tool input generation. By traversing this structured representation, AutoTool efficiently selects tools and their parameters with minimal reliance on LLM inference. Extensive experiments across diverse agent tasks demonstrate that AutoTool reduces inference costs by up to 30% while maintaining competitive task completion rates, offering a practical and scalable enhancement for inference-heavy frameworks. Our work highlights the promise of integrating statistical structure into LLM agent design for greater efficiency without sacrificing performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ICL方法在顺序决策中难以同时满足三个关键原则：关注决策关键信息、提供步骤级粒度、最小化专家标注依赖。

Method: 构建动作中心的领域级图，通过时间差分信用分配识别高效用动作，检索逐步技能以生成细粒度上下文感知提示。

Result: 在ALFWorld、BabyAI和ScienceWorld基准测试中，使用开源和专有LLM，SkillGen平均提升进度率5.9%-16.5%。

Conclusion: 关注高效用片段支持任务可识别性，并为更有效的ICL提示设计提供信息，SkillGen框架在顺序决策任务中取得一致性能提升。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to sequential decision-making through in-context learning (ICL), yet their effectiveness is highly sensitive to prompt quality. Effective prompts should meet three principles: focus on decision-critical information, provide step-level granularity, and minimize reliance on expert annotations through label efficiency. However, existing ICL methods often fail to satisfy all three criteria simultaneously. Motivated by these challenges, we introduce SkillGen, a skill-based ICL framework for structured sequential reasoning. It constructs an action-centric, domain-level graph from sampled trajectories, identifies high-utility actions via temporal-difference credit assignment, and retrieves step-wise skills to generate fine-grained, context-aware prompts. We further present a theoretical analysis showing that focusing on high-utility segments supports task identifiability and informs more effective ICL prompt design.

Motivation: 大规模停电后配电网恢复需要处理非线性约束（功率平衡、电压限制、热额定值等），传统优化方法和基于价值的RL方法计算效率低且难以扩展。

Method: 采用异构智能体近端策略优化（HAPPO）框架，每个智能体控制具有不同负载、DER容量和开关数量的微电网，使用去中心化actor策略和集中式critic进行训练，通过物理信息化的OpenDSS环境提供功率流反馈。

Result: 在IEEE 123总线和IEEE 8500节点系统上的实验表明，HAPPO比DQN、PPO、MAES等算法收敛更快，恢复功率更高，多种子训练更稳定。

Conclusion: 在HARL框架中引入微电网级异构性，为复杂配电网恢复提供了可扩展、稳定且约束感知的解决方案。

Abstract: Restoring power distribution systems (PDS) after large-scale outages requires sequential switching operations that reconfigure feeder topology and coordinate distributed energy resources (DERs) under nonlinear constraints such as power balance, voltage limits, and thermal ratings. These challenges make conventional optimization and value-based RL approaches computationally inefficient and difficult to scale. This paper applies a Heterogeneous-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HARL) framework, instantiated through Heterogeneous-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (HAPPO), to enable coordinated restoration across interconnected microgrids. Each agent controls a distinct microgrid with different loads, DER capacities, and switch counts, introducing practical structural heterogeneity. Decentralized actor policies are trained with a centralized critic to compute advantage values for stable on-policy updates. A physics-informed OpenDSS environment provides full power flow feedback and enforces operational limits via differentiable penalty signals rather than invalid action masking. The total DER generation is capped at 2400 kW, and each microgrid must satisfy local supply-demand feasibility. Experiments on the IEEE 123-bus and IEEE 8500-node systems show that HAPPO achieves faster convergence, higher restored power, and smoother multi-seed training than DQN, PPO, MAES, MAGDPG, MADQN, Mean-Field RL, and QMIX. Results demonstrate that incorporating microgrid-level heterogeneity within the HARL framework yields a scalable, stable, and constraint-aware solution for complex PDS restoration.
