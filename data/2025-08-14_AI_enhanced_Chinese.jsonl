In this paper, we demonstrate that the unstable\nPDI is primarily induced by the conformation boundary conditions additionally\nintroduced in the ACD equation system, which could be eliminated if a new set\nof conformation conditions is adopted. To address this issue, we begin with an\nasymptotic analysis of the PDI within the near-wall thin diffusive layer, which\nsimplifies the complexity of the instability system by reducing the number of\nthe controlling parameters from five to zero. Then, based on this simplified\nmodel, we construct a stable asymptotic solution that minimises the\nperturbations in the wall sublayer. From the near-wall behaviour of this\nsolution, we derive a new set of conformation boundary conditions, prescribing\na Neumann-type condition for its streamwise stretching component, $c_{11}$, a\nRobin-type condition for its transverse shear component, $c_{12}$, and\nDirichlet conditions for all the other conformation components. These boundary\nconditions are subsequently validated within the original ACD instability\nsystem, incorporating both the Oldroyd-B and FENE-P constitutive models.\nFinally, we perform direct numerical simulations based on the traditional and\nthe new conformation conditions, demonstrating the effectiveness of the latter\nin eliminating the unstable PDI.

The dimensionally reduced ODT domain enables fully resolved numerical\nsimulations of the flow across the radial gap between the cylindrical inner\nwall and the cylindrical outer wall. The model is calibrated with available\nreference data at low bulk Reynolds number $Re_{D_h} = 8900$ for a wide (radius\nratio $\\eta = 0.1$) and a moderate ($\\eta = 0.5$) gap. Making use of the\nmodel's predictive capabilities, radius ratio and Reynolds number effects are\ninvestigated, reaching bulk Reynolds numbers as large as $Re_{D_h}=10^6$.\nDespite the large $Re_{D_h}$ values reached, spanwise wall-curvature effects\nremain sensible in the momentum boundary layer. The effects are more pronounced\nfor larger wall curvature and to leading orders restricted to the convex\ncylindrical inner wall. Wall-curvature corrections to the law of the wall are\nobtained for both the viscous and Reynolds-stress dominated regions by fitting\nanalytically derived expressions for the flow profile to the stochastic\nsimulation data, demonstrating physical compatibility with Reynolds-averaged\nNavier--Stokes flow. Second-order and detailed fluctuation statistics\ndemonstrate the permeating and nonlocal influence of spanwise wall curvature on\nthe turbulent boundary layer.

Recent\nmodel-based approaches (e.g., non-persistent and $p$-persistent CSMA) simply\noptimize backoff strategies under a known and fixed node density, still leading\nto a large throughput loss due to inaccurate node density estimation. This\npaper is the first to propose LLM transformer-based in-context learning (ICL)\ntheory for optimizing channel access. We design a transformer-based ICL\noptimizer to pre-collect collision-threshold data examples and a query\ncollision case. They are constructed as a prompt as the input for the\ntransformer to learn the pattern, which then generates a predicted contention\nwindow threshold (CWT).

Traditional methods, such\nas Delphi studies, consensus conferences, and systematic guideline synthesis,\noffer structure but face limitations including high panel burden, interpretive\noversimplification, and suppression of conditional nuance. These challenges are\nnow exacerbated by information overload, fragmentation of the evidence base,\nand increasing reliance on publicly available sources that lack expert\nfiltering. This study introduces and evaluates a Human-AI Hybrid Delphi\n(HAH-Delphi) framework designed to augment expert consensus development by\nintegrating a generative AI model (Gemini 2.5 Pro), small panels of senior\nhuman experts, and structured facilitation. The HAH-Delphi was tested in three\nphases: retrospective replication, prospective comparison, and applied\ndeployment in two applied domains (endurance training and resistance and mixed\ncardio/strength training). The AI replicated 95% of published expert consensus\nconclusions in Phase I and showed 95% directional agreement with senior human\nexperts in Phase II, though it lacked experiential and pragmatic nuance. In\nPhase III, compact panels of six senior experts achieved >90% consensus\ncoverage and reached thematic saturation before the final participant.

This suggests that the benefits\nattributed to complex sequencemixers might instead emerge from other\narchitectural or optimization factors.

This\nsubstitution isolates the mixing operation, enabling a clear theoretical\nfoundation for understanding its role. Therefore, we conducted extensive\nexperiments on 29 benchmarks covering five representative TSA tasks using seven\nstate-of-the-art TSA models to address our research question.

Such\nmodels have no access to acoustic context and no built-in control over acoustic\ndetails. In this work, we propose to jointly model linguistic and acoustic\ninformation by generating semantic tokens and a continuous real-valued\nrepresentation of the acoustic frame. We use a flow-matching objective to\npredict the continuous vector conditioned on the semantic tokens. We study the\ndesign space of this approach and find that predicting multiple future semantic\ntokens helps preserve linguistic information.

Existing methods either address unobserved\nconfounders while ignoring the simultaneous feedback, or account for feedback\nbut under restrictive linear assumptions, thus failing to obtain accurate peer\neffect estimation. In this paper, we propose DIG2RSI, a novel Deep learning\nframework which leverages I-G transformation (matrix operation) and 2SRI (an\ninstrumental variable or IV technique) to address both simultaneous feedback\nand unobserved confounding, while accommodating complex, nonlinear and\nhigh-dimensional relationships. DIG2RSI first applies the I-G transformation to\ndisentangle mutual peer influences and eliminate the bias due to the\nsimultaneous feedback. To deal with unobserved confounding, we first construct\nvalid IVs from network data. In stage 1 of 2RSI, we train a neural network on\nthese IVs to predict peer exposure, and extract residuals as proxies for the\nunobserved confounders. In the stage 2, we fit a separate neural network\naugmented by an adversarial discriminator that incorporates these residuals as\na control function and enforces the learned representation to contain no\nresidual confounding signal. The expressive power of deep learning models in\ncapturing complex non-linear relationships and adversarial debiasing enhances\nthe effectiveness of DIG2RSI in eliminating bias from both feedback loops and\nhidden confounders. We prove consistency of our estimator under standard\nregularity conditions, ensuring asymptotic recovery of the true peer effect.\nEmpirical results on two semi-synthetic benchmarks and a real-world dataset\ndemonstrate that DIG2RSI outperforms existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "DIG2RSI\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408I-G\u53d8\u6362\u548c2SRI\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u672a\u89c2\u6d4b\u6df7\u6742\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u672a\u89c2\u6d4b\u6df7\u6742\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "method": "DIG2RSI\u901a\u8fc7I-G\u53d8\u6362\u89e3\u8026\u76f8\u4e92\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5229\u75282SRI\u6280\u672f\u6784\u9020\u5de5\u5177\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u53bb\u504f\u6d88\u9664\u6df7\u6742\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660eDIG2RSI\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u534a\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DIG2RSI\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u540c\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u672a\u89c2\u6d4b\u6df7\u6742\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4f30\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

However, deep FER models often struggle with subtle\nexpressions and high inter-subject variability, limiting their performance in\nreal-world applications. To improve their performance, source-free domain\nadaptation (SFDA) methods have been proposed to personalize a pretrained source\nmodel using only unlabeled target domain data, thereby avoiding data privacy,\nstorage, and transmission constraints. This paper addresses a challenging\nscenario where source data is unavailable for adaptation, and only unlabeled\ntarget data consisting solely of neutral expressions is available. SFDA methods\nare not typically designed to adapt using target data from only a single class.\nFurther, using models to generate facial images with non-neutral expressions\ncan be unstable and computationally intensive. In this paper, personalized\nfeature translation (PFT) is proposed for SFDA. Unlike current image\ntranslation methods for SFDA, our lightweight method operates in the latent\nspace. We first pre-train the translator on the source domain data to transform\nthe subject-specific style features from one source subject into another.\nExpression information is preserved by optimizing a combination of expression\nconsistency and style-aware objectives. Then, the translator is adapted on\nneutral target data, without using source data or image synthesis. By\ntranslating in the latent space, PFT avoids the complexity and noise of face\nexpression generation, producing discriminative embeddings optimized for\nclassification. Using PFT eliminates the need for image synthesis, reduces\ncomputational overhead (using a lightweight translator), and only adapts part\nof the model, making the method efficient compared to image-based translation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff08PFT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\uff08FER\uff09\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6FER\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec6\u5fae\u8868\u60c5\u548c\u9ad8\u4e2a\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u6e90\u81ea\u7531\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff08SFDA\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u4ec5\u542b\u4e2d\u6027\u8868\u60c5\u7684\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "PFT\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u5148\u5728\u6e90\u57df\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5668\uff0c\u518d\u4ec5\u7528\u4e2d\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u3002", "result": "PFT\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u8868\u60c5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "PFT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u8f7b\u91cf\u7684SFDA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4ec5\u542b\u4e2d\u6027\u8868\u60c5\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

However, their vulnerability to adversarial prompts remains a\nserious concern, as safety mechanisms often fail to prevent the generation of\nharmful outputs. Although recent jailbreak strategies report high success\nrates, many responses classified as \"successful\" are actually benign, vague, or\nunrelated to the intended malicious goal. This mismatch suggests that current\nevaluation standards may overestimate the effectiveness of such attacks. To\naddress this issue, we introduce a four-axis evaluation framework that\nconsiders input on-topicness, input out-of-distribution (OOD) intensity, output\nharmfulness, and output refusal rate. This framework identifies truly effective\njailbreaks. In a substantial empirical study, we reveal a structural trade-off:\nhighly on-topic prompts are frequently blocked by safety filters, whereas those\nthat are too OOD often evade detection but fail to produce harmful content.\nHowever, prompts that balance relevance and novelty are more likely to evade\nfilters and trigger dangerous output. Building on this insight, we develop a\nrecursive rewriting strategy called Balanced Structural Decomposition (BSD).\nThe approach restructures malicious prompts into semantically aligned\nsub-tasks, while introducing subtle OOD signals and visual cues that make the\ninputs harder to detect. BSD was tested across 13 commercial and open-source\nMLLMs, where it consistently led to higher attack success rates, more harmful\noutputs, and fewer refusals.

We present\nGradient-Direction-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GDAGS), a gradient-direction-aware\nadaptive density control framework to address these challenges. Our key\ninnovations: the gradient coherence ratio (GCR), computed through normalized\ngradient vector norms, which explicitly discriminates Gaussians with concordant\nversus conflicting gradient directions; and a nonlinear dynamic weighting\nmechanism leverages the GCR to enable gradient-direction-aware density control.\nSpecifically, GDAGS prioritizes conflicting-gradient Gaussians during splitting\noperations to enhance geometric details while suppressing redundant\nconcordant-direction Gaussians. Conversely, in cloning processes, GDAGS\npromotes concordant-direction Gaussian densification for structural completion\nwhile preventing conflicting-direction Gaussian overpopulation.

It is a fundamental problem in\nagent-based modeling (ABM), which has become the standard to analyze\nintelligent transportation systems. The synthetic population serves as the\nprimary input for ABM transportation simulation, with traveling agents\nrepresented by population members. However, when the number of attributes\ndescribing agents becomes large, survey data often cannot densely support the\njoint distribution of the attributes in the population due to the curse of\ndimensionality. This sparsity makes it difficult to accurately model and\nproduce the population. Interestingly, deep generative models trained from\navailable sample data can potentially synthesize possible attribute\ncombinations that present in the actual population but do not exist in the\nsample data(called sampling zeros). Nevertheless, this comes at the cost of\nfalsely generating the infeasible attribute combinations that do not exist in\nthe population (called structural zeros). In this study, a novel diffusion\nmodel-based population synthesis method is proposed to estimate the underlying\njoint distribution of a population.

Despite efforts to address\nchallenges such as scaling model size and data volume, the cost associated with\npre-training and fine-tuning remains substantial. However, pre-trained large\nmultimodal models (LMMs) encounter a modality gap, characterised by a\nmisalignment between textual and visual representations within a common\nembedding space. Although fine-tuning can potentially mitigate this gap, it is\ntypically expensive and impractical due to the requirement for extensive\ndomain-driven data. To overcome this challenge, we propose a lightweight\ntraining-free approach utilising Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to extend\nacross the modality using a linear mapping, which can be computed efficiently.\nDuring inference, this mapping is applied to images embedded by an LMM enabling\nretrieval of closest textual descriptions from the training set.

Leveraging its high capability to generate high-fidelity and\ndiverse synthetic data, generative AI is widely applied in diagnostic tasks,\nsuch as lung cancer diagnosis using computed tomography (CT). However, existing\ngenerative models for lung cancer diagnosis suffer from low efficiency and\nanatomical imprecision, which limit their clinical applicability. To address\nthese drawbacks, we propose Lung-DDPM+, an improved version of our previous\nmodel, Lung-DDPM. This novel approach is a denoising diffusion probabilistic\nmodel (DDPM) guided by nodule semantic layouts and accelerated by a pulmonary\nDPM-solver, enabling the method to focus on lesion areas while achieving a\nbetter trade-off between sampling efficiency and quality. Evaluation results on\nthe public LIDC-IDRI dataset suggest that the proposed method achieves\n8$\\times$ fewer FLOPs (floating point operations per second), 6.8$\\times$ lower\nGPU memory consumption, and 14$\\times$ faster sampling compared to Lung-DDPM.\nMoreover, it maintains comparable sample quality to both Lung-DDPM and other\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models in two downstream segmentation tasks.\nWe also conducted a Visual Turing Test by an experienced radiologist, showing\nthe advanced quality and fidelity of synthetic samples generated by the\nproposed method. These experimental results demonstrate that Lung-DDPM+ can\neffectively generate high-quality thoracic CT images with lung nodules,\nhighlighting its potential for broader applications, such as general tumor\nsynthesis and lesion generation in medical imaging.

However, many current state-of-the-art attacks require access to\nmodels' hidden states or probability distribution, which prevents investigation\ninto more widely-used, API-access only models like GPT-4. In this work, we\nintroduce N-Gram Coverage Attack, a membership inference attack that relies\nsolely on text outputs from the target model, enabling attacks on completely\nblack-box models. We leverage the observation that models are more likely to\nmemorize and subsequently generate text patterns that were commonly observed in\ntheir training data. Specifically, to make a prediction on a candidate member,\nN-Gram Coverage Attack first obtains multiple model generations conditioned on\na prefix of the candidate. It then uses n-gram overlap metrics to compute and\naggregate the similarities of these outputs with the ground truth suffix; high\nsimilarities indicate likely membership. We first demonstrate on a diverse set\nof existing benchmarks that N-Gram Coverage Attack outperforms other black-box\nmethods while also impressively achieving comparable or even better performance\nto state-of-the-art white-box attacks - despite having access to only text\noutputs. Interestingly, we find that the success rate of our method scales with\nthe attack compute budget - as we increase the number of sequences generated\nfrom the target model conditioned on the prefix, attack performance tends to\nimprove. Having verified the accuracy of our method, we use it to investigate\npreviously unstudied closed OpenAI models on multiple domains.

We present a novel, large-scale\ndataset comprising 52,305 samples, including human-written abstracts across 12\ndiverse scientific domains and AI-generated counterparts from five\nstate-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4-Turbo, Gemma2-27B, Llama3.3-70B, Deepseek-V3, and\nGigaChat-Lite). A core objective of the task is to challenge participants to\ndevelop robust solutions capable of generalizing to both (i) previously unseen\nscientific domains and (ii) models not included in the training data. The task\nwas organized in two phases, attracting 10 teams and 159 submissions, with top\nsystems demonstrating strong performance in identifying AI-generated content.\nWe also establish a continuous shared task platform to foster ongoing research\nand long-term progress in this important area.

While static, uniform quantization applies a fixed bit-width\nto all inputs, it fails to adapt to their varying complexity. Dynamic,\ninstance-based mixed-precision quantization promises a superior\naccuracy-efficiency trade-off by allocating higher precision only when needed.\nHowever, a critical bottleneck remains: existing methods require a costly\ndequantize-to-float and requantize-to-integer cycle to change precision,\nbreaking the integer-only hardware paradigm and compromising performance gains.\nThis paper introduces Dynamic Quantization Training (DQT), a novel framework\nthat removes this bottleneck. At the core of DQT is a nested integer\nrepresentation where lower-precision values are bit-wise embedded within\nhigher-precision ones. This design, coupled with custom integer-only\narithmetic, allows for on-the-fly bit-width switching through a near-zero-cost\nbit-shift operation. This makes DQT the first quantization framework to enable\nboth dequantization-free static mixed-precision of the backbone network, and\ntruly efficient dynamic, instance-based quantization through a lightweight\ncontroller that decides at runtime how to quantize each layer. We demonstrate\nDQT state-of-the-art performance on ResNet18 on CIFAR-10 and ResNet50 on\nImageNet. On ImageNet, our 4-bit dynamic ResNet50 achieves 77.00% top-1\naccuracy, an improvement over leading static (LSQ, 76.70%) and dynamic (DQNET,\n76.94%) methods at a comparable BitOPs budget. Crucially, DQT achieves this\nwith a bit-width transition cost of only 28.3M simple bit-shift operations, a\ndrastic improvement over the 56.6M costly Multiply-Accumulate (MAC)\nfloating-point operations required by previous dynamic approaches - unlocking a\nnew frontier in efficient, adaptive AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u91cf\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08DQT\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5d4c\u5957\u6574\u6570\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u6574\u6570\u8fd0\u7b97\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u52a8\u6001\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u52a8\u6001\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6d6e\u70b9\u8fd0\u7b97\u6765\u5207\u6362\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u7834\u574f\u4e86\u6574\u6570\u786c\u4ef6\u8303\u5f0f\u5e76\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u3002DQT\u65e8\u5728\u6d88\u9664\u8fd9\u4e00\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "DQT\u91c7\u7528\u5d4c\u5957\u6574\u6570\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u6574\u6570\u8fd0\u7b97\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4f4d\u79fb\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u51b3\u5b9a\u91cf\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet\u4e0a\uff0c4\u4f4d\u52a8\u6001ResNet50\u8fbe\u523077.00% top-1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5207\u6362\u6210\u672c\u4ec5\u4e3a28.3M\u4f4d\u79fb\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "DQT\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u81ea\u9002\u5e94AI\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

However, few works have noted the negative effects on SLM\nsafety brought by the training, which are revealed in this study. Although\nthere are works on safety alignment that fine-tune language models or\nmanipulate model weights to defend against harmful inputs, they require extra\ncomputation or annotated data, and probably impact the reasoning ability of\nSLMs. In this paper, we investigate how to maintain the safety of SLMs during\nthe CoT distillation process. Specifically, we propose a safe distillation\nmethod, Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking Distillation (SLowED), containing\ntwo modules: Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking. Slow Tuning scales down the\nmagnitude of model weight changes to optimize the model weights in the\nneighboring space near the initial weight distribution.

A series of defense strategies have been proposed for\nthe alignment, fine-tuning, and post-fine-tuning phases, where most\npost-fine-tuning defenses rely on coarse-grained safety layer mapping. These\nmethods lack a comprehensive consideration of both safety layers and\nfine-grained neurons, limiting their ability to efficiently balance safety and\nutility. To address this, we propose the Fine-Grained Safety Neurons (FGSN)\nwith Training-Free Continual Projection method to reduce the fine-tuning safety\nrisks. FGSN inherently integrates the multi-scale interactions between safety\nlayers and neurons, localizing sparser and more precise fine-grained safety\nneurons while minimizing interference with downstream task neurons.

However, a critical limitation of existing\nRefSR approaches is their reliance on manually curated target-reference image\npairs, which severely constrains their practicality in real-world scenarios. To\novercome this, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Super Resolution (RASR), a new\nand practical RefSR paradigm that automatically retrieves semantically relevant\nhigh-resolution images from a reference database given only a low-quality\ninput. This enables scalable and flexible RefSR in realistic use cases, such as\nenhancing mobile photos taken in environments like zoos or museums, where\ncategory-specific reference data (e.g., animals, artworks) can be readily\ncollected or pre-curated. To facilitate research in this direction, we\nconstruct RASR-Flickr30, the first benchmark dataset designed for RASR. Unlike\nprior datasets with fixed target-reference pairs, RASR-Flickr30 provides\nper-category reference databases to support open-world retrieval. We further\npropose RASRNet, a strong baseline that combines a semantic reference retriever\nwith a diffusion-based RefSR generator.

In this work, we present HyperKD, a novel\nknowledge distillation framework that enables transferring learned\nrepresentations from a teacher model into a student model for effective\ndevelopment of a foundation model on hyperspectral images. Unlike typical\nknowledge distillation frameworks, which use a complex teacher to guide a\nsimpler student, HyperKD enables an inverse form of knowledge transfer across\ndifferent types of spectral data, guided by a simpler teacher model. Building\nupon a Masked Autoencoder, HyperKD distills knowledge from the Prithvi\nfoundational model into a student tailored for EnMAP hyperspectral imagery.\nHyperKD addresses the inverse domain adaptation problem with spectral gaps by\nintroducing a feature-based strategy that includes spectral range-based channel\nalignment, spatial feature-guided masking, and an enhanced loss function\ntailored for hyperspectral images. HyperKD bridges the substantial spectral\ndomain gap, enabling the effective use of pretrained foundation models for\ngeospatial applications.

However, most existing methods only apply to human figures, which\nusually do not generalize well on anthropomorphic characters commonly used in\nindustries like gaming and entertainment. Furthermore, previous methods could\nonly generate videos with static backgrounds, which limits the realism of the\nvideos. For the first challenge, our in-depth analysis suggests to attribute\nthis limitation to their insufficient modeling of motion, which is unable to\ncomprehend the movement pattern of the driving video, thus imposing a pose\nsequence rigidly onto the target character. To this end, this paper proposes\nAnimate-X++, a universal animation framework based on DiT for various character\ntypes, including anthropomorphic characters. To enhance motion representation,\nwe introduce the Pose Indicator, which captures comprehensive motion pattern\nfrom the driving video through both implicit and explicit manner. The former\nleverages CLIP visual features of a driving video to extract its gist of\nmotion, like the overall movement pattern and temporal relations among motions,\nwhile the latter strengthens the generalization of DiT by simulating possible\ninputs in advance that may arise during inference. For the second challenge, we\nintroduce a multi-task training strategy that jointly trains the animation and\nTI2V tasks. Combined with the proposed partial parameter training, this\napproach achieves not only character animation but also text-driven background\ndynamics, making the videos more realistic. Moreover, we introduce a new\nAnimated Anthropomorphic Benchmark (A2Bench) to evaluate the performance of\nAnimate-X++ on universal and widely applicable animation images.

In this paper, we introduce a novel input-aware backdoor\nattack method, IAG, designed to manipulate the grounding behavior of VLMs. This\nattack forces the model to ground a specific target object in the input image,\nregardless of the user's query. We propose an adaptive trigger generator that\nembeds the semantic information of the attack target's description into the\noriginal image using a text-conditional U-Net, thereby overcoming the\nopen-vocabulary attack challenge. To ensure the attack's stealthiness, we\nutilize a reconstruction loss to minimize visual discrepancies between poisoned\nand clean images. Additionally, we introduce a unified method for generating\nattack data. IAG is evaluated theoretically and empirically, demonstrating its\nfeasibility and effectiveness.

Yet message-passing GNNs suffer from over-squashing --\nexponential compression of long-range information from distant nodes -- which\nlimits expressivity. Rewiring techniques can ease this bottleneck; but their\npractical impacts are unclear due to the lack of a direct empirical\nover-squashing metric. We propose a rigorous, topology-focused method for\nassessing over-squashing between node pairs using the decay rate of their\nmutual sensitivity. We then extend these pairwise assessments to four\ngraph-level statistics (prevalence, intensity, variability, extremity).\nCoupling these metrics with a within-graph causal design, we quantify how\nrewiring strategies affect over-squashing on diverse graph- and\nnode-classification benchmarks. Our extensive empirical analyses show that most\ngraph classification datasets suffer from over-squashing (but to various\nextents), and rewiring effectively mitigates it -- though the degree of\nmitigation, and its translation into performance gains, varies by dataset and\nmethod. We also found that over-squashing is less notable in node\nclassification datasets, where rewiring often increases over-squashing, and\nperformance variations are uncorrelated with over-squashing changes. These\nfindings suggest that rewiring is most beneficial when over-squashing is both\nsubstantial and corrected with restraint -- while overly aggressive rewiring,\nor rewiring applied to minimally over-squashed graphs, is unlikely to help and\nmay even harm performance.

To address these, we present two key innovations.\nFirst, we introduce a Mixture of Facial Experts (MoFE) that dynamically\ncombines complementary cues from three specialized experts, each designed to\ncapture distinct but mutually reinforcing aspects of facial attributes. The\nidentity expert captures cross-pose identity-sensitive features, the semantic\nexpert extracts high-level visual semantxics, and the detail expert preserves\npixel-level features (e.g., skin texture, color gradients). Furthermore, to\nmitigate dataset limitations, we have tailored a data processing pipeline\ncentered on two key aspects: Face Constraints and Identity Consistency. Face\nConstraints ensure facial angle diversity and a high proportion of facial\nregions, while Identity Consistency preserves coherent person-specific features\nacross temporal sequences, collectively addressing the scarcity of large facial\nangles and identity-stable training data in existing datasets. Leveraging this\npipeline, we have curated and refined a Large Face Angles (LFA) Dataset from\nexisting open-source human video datasets, comprising 460K video clips with\nannotated facial angles.

While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its\nvariants have recently attracted attention for its high efficiency, existing\nmethods remain unsuitable for satellite images due to incompatibility with\nrational polynomial coefficient (RPC) models and limited generalization\ncapability. Recent advances in generalizable 3DGS approaches show potential,\nbut they perform poorly on multi-temporal sparse satellite images due to\nlimited geometric constraints, transient objects, and radiometric\ninconsistencies. To address these limitations, we propose SkySplat, a novel\nself-supervised framework that integrates the RPC model into the generalizable\n3DGS pipeline, enabling more effective use of sparse geometric cues for\nimproved reconstruction. SkySplat relies only on RGB images and\nradiometric-robust relative height supervision, thereby eliminating the need\nfor ground-truth height maps. Key components include a Cross-Self Consistency\nModule (CSCM), which mitigates transient object interference via\nconsistency-based masking, and a multi-view consistency aggregation strategy\nthat refines reconstruction results. Compared to per-scene optimization\nmethods, SkySplat achieves an 86 times speedup over EOGS with higher accuracy.\nIt also outperforms generalizable 3DGS baselines, reducing MAE from 13.18 m to\n1.80 m on the DFC19 dataset significantly, and demonstrates strong\ncross-dataset generalization on the MVS3D benchmark.", "AI": {"tldr": "SkySplat\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408RPC\u6a21\u578b\u52303DGS\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093DGS\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728RPC\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSkySplat\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408RPC\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5f15\u5165CSCM\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "SkySplat\u6bd4EOGS\u5feb86\u500d\uff0cMAE\u4ece13.18\u7c73\u964d\u81f31.80\u7c73\uff0c\u5728DFC19\u548cMVS3D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "SkySplat\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, a key question\nremains: given that real-world image datasets already constitute a natural\nsource of high-quality data, why should we use GPT-4o-generated synthetic data?\nIn this work, we identify two key advantages of synthetic images. First, they\ncan complement rare scenarios in real-world datasets, such as surreal fantasy\nor multi-reference image generation, which frequently occur in user queries.\nSecond, they provide clean and controllable supervision. Real-world data often\ncontains complex background noise and inherent misalignment between text\ndescriptions and image content, whereas synthetic images offer pure backgrounds\nand long-tailed supervision signals, facilitating more accurate text-to-image\nalignment. Building on these insights, we introduce Echo-4o-Image, a 180K-scale\nsynthetic dataset generated by GPT-4o, harnessing the power of synthetic image\ndata to address blind spots in real-world coverage.

We present\nWeatherPrompt, a multi-modality learning paradigm that establishes\nweather-invariant representations through fusing the image embedding with the\ntext context. Our framework introduces two key contributions: First, a\nTraining-free Weather Reasoning mechanism that employs off-the-shelf large\nmulti-modality models to synthesize multi-weather textual descriptions through\nhuman-like reasoning. It improves the scalability to unseen or complex weather,\nand could reflect different weather strength. Second, to better disentangle the\nscene and weather feature, we propose a multi-modality framework with the\ndynamic gating mechanism driven by the text embedding to adaptively reweight\nand fuse visual features across modalities.

To address the challenges, we focus on a trustworthy RRG model, which\nnot only generates accurate descriptions of abnormalities, but also provides\nbasis of its predictions. To this end, we propose a framework named chain of\ndiagnosis (CoD), which maintains a chain of diagnostic process for clinically\naccurate and explainable RRG. It first generates question-answer (QA) pairs via\ndiagnostic conversation to extract key findings, then prompts a large language\nmodel with QA diagnoses for accurate generation. To enhance explainability, a\ndiagnosis grounding module is designed to match QA diagnoses and generated\nsentences, where the diagnoses act as a reference.

To address these challenges, we propose CGAD, a Causal\nGraph-based Anomaly Detection framework designed for reliable cyberattack\ndetection in public infrastructure systems. CGAD follows a two-phase supervised\nframework -- causal profiling and anomaly scoring. First, it learns causal\ninvariant graph structures representing the system's behavior under \"Normal\"\nand \"Attack\" states using Dynamic Bayesian Networks. Second, it employs\nstructural divergence to detect anomalies via causal graph comparison by\nevaluating topological deviations in causal graphs over time. By leveraging\ncausal structures, CGAD achieves superior adaptability and accuracy in\nnon-stationary and imbalanced time series environments compared to conventional\nmachine learning approaches. By uncovering causal structures beneath volatile\nsensor data, our framework not only detects cyberattacks with markedly higher\nprecision but also redefines robustness in anomaly detection, proving\nresilience where traditional models falter under imbalance and drift.

While recent\nadvancements have achieved photorealistic renderings and plausible animation,\nhead editing, especially real-time appearance editing, remains challenging due\nto the implicit representation and entangled modeling of the geometry and\nglobal appearance. To address this, we propose Surface-Volumetric Gaussian Head\nAvatar (SVG-Head), a novel hybrid representation that explicitly models the\ngeometry with 3D Gaussians bound on a FLAME mesh and leverages disentangled\ntexture images to capture the global appearance. Technically, it contains two\ntypes of Gaussians, in which surface Gaussians explicitly model the appearance\nof head avatars using learnable texture images, facilitating real-time texture\nediting, while volumetric Gaussians enhance the reconstruction quality of\nnon-Lambertian regions (e.g., lips and hair). To model the correspondence\nbetween 3D world and texture space, we provide a mesh-aware Gaussian UV mapping\nmethod, which leverages UV coordinates given by the FLAME mesh to obtain sharp\ntexture images and real-time rendering speed. A hierarchical optimization\nstrategy is further designed to pursue the optimal performance in both\nreconstruction quality and editing flexibility.

However, we observe that despite impressive FID scores,\nstate-of-the-art models often generate distorted or low-quality images,\nespecially in certain classes. This gap arises because FID evaluates global\ndistribution alignment, while ignoring the perceptual quality of individual\nsamples. We further examine the role of CFG, a common technique used to enhance\ngeneration quality. While effective in improving metrics and suppressing\noutliers, CFG can introduce distribution shift and visual artifacts due to its\nmisalignment with both training objectives and user expectations. In this work,\nwe propose FaME, a training-free and inference-efficient method for improving\nperceptual quality. FaME uses an image quality assessment model to identify\nlow-quality generations and stores their sampling trajectories.

To address this issue, we introduce BridgeTA, a cost-effective\ndistillation framework to bridge the representation gap between LC fusion and\nCamera-only models through a Teacher Assistant (TA) network while keeping the\nstudent's architecture and inference cost unchanged. A lightweight TA network\ncombines the BEV representations of the teacher and student, creating a shared\nlatent space that serves as an intermediate representation.

A further\ncontribution is the generation of a large pseudo-CBCT dataset (16,182) from\nchest CT volumes of the CT-RATE public dataset to robustly train MInDI-3D. We\nperformed a comprehensive evaluation, including quantitative metrics,\nscalability analysis, generalisation tests, and a clinical assessment by 11\nclinicians. Our results show MInDI-3D's effectiveness, achieving a 12.96 (6.10)\ndB PSNR gain over uncorrected scans with only 50 projections on the CT-RATE\npseudo-CBCT (independent real-world) test set and enabling an 8x reduction in\nimaging radiation exposure. We demonstrate its scalability by showing that\nperformance improves with more training data.

While RANSAC is a robust strategy with strong probabilistic\nguarantees, the ambiguity of its inlier threshold criterion makes it\nsusceptible to false positive plane detections. This issue is particularly\nprevalent in complex real-world scenes, where the true number of planes is\nunknown and multiple planes coexist. In this paper, we aim to address this\nlimitation by proposing a generalised framework for plane detection based on\nmodel information optimization. Building on previous works, we treat the\nobserved depth readings as discrete random variables, with their probability\ndistributions constrained by the ground truth planes. Various models containing\ndifferent candidate plane constraints are then generated through repeated\nrandom sub-sampling to explain our observations. By incorporating the physics\nand noise model of the depth sensor, we can calculate the information for each\nmodel, and the model with the least information is accepted as the most likely\nground truth. This information optimization process serves as an objective\nmechanism for determining the true number of planes and preventing false\npositive detections. Additionally, the quality of each detected plane can be\nranked by summing the information reduction of inlier points for each plane. We\nvalidate these properties through experiments with synthetic data and find that\nour algorithm estimates plane parameters more accurately compared to the\ndefault Open3D RANSAC plane segmentation.

Unlike standard approaches that assume\nsigmoidal melting curves and are constrained by empirical null distributions\n(limiting significant hits to approximately 5 % of data), Thermal Tracks uses\nGaussian Process (GP) models with squared-exponential kernels to flexibly model\nany melting curve shape while generating unbiased null distributions through\nkernel priors. This framework is particularly valuable for analyzing\nproteome-wide perturbations that significantly alter protein thermal stability,\nsuch as pathway inhibitions, genetic modifications, or environmental stresses,\nwhere conventional TPP methods may miss biologically relevant changes due to\ntheir statistical constraints. Furthermore, Thermal Tracks excels at analyzing\nproteins with un-conventional melting profiles, including phase-separating\nproteins and membrane proteins, which often exhibit complex, non-sigmoidal\nthermal stability behaviors.

Accurate identification of\nstandard fetal torso planes is essential for reliable assessment and\npersonalized prenatal care. However, limitations such as low contrast and\nunclear texture details in ultrasound imaging pose significant challenges for\nfine-grained anatomical recognition. Methods: We propose a novel Multi-Contrast\nFusion Module (MCFM) to enhance the model's ability to extract detailed\ninformation from ultrasound images. MCFM operates exclusively on the lower\nlayers of the neural network, directly processing raw ultrasound data. By\nassigning attention weights to image representations under different contrast\nconditions, the module enhances feature modeling while explicitly maintaining\nminimal parameter overhead. Results: The proposed MCFM was evaluated on a\ncurated dataset of fetal torso plane ultrasound images. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that MCFM substantially improves recognition performance, with a\nminimal increase in model complexity. The integration of multi-contrast\nattention enables the model to better capture subtle anatomical structures,\ncontributing to higher classification accuracy and clinical reliability.\nConclusions: Our method provides an effective solution for improving fetal\ntorso plane recognition in ultrasound imaging. By enhancing feature\nrepresentation through multi-contrast fusion, the proposed approach supports\nclinicians in achieving more accurate and consistent diagnoses, demonstrating\nstrong potential for clinical adoption in prenatal screening.

Recent advances in graph generative modeling\noffer a data-driven alternative, enabling synthetic connectome generation and\nreducing dependence on large neuroimaging datasets. However, current models\nface key limitations: (i) compressing the whole graph into a single latent code\n(e.g., VGAEs) blurs fine-grained local motifs; (ii) relying on rich node\nattributes rarely available in connectomes reduces reconstruction quality;\n(iii) edge-centric models emphasize topology but overlook accurate edge-weight\nprediction, harming quantitative fidelity; and (iv) computationally expensive\ndesigns (e.g., edge-conditioned convolutions) impose high memory demands,\nlimiting scalability.

Furthermore, considering the lack of suitable\nbenchmarks for 3DGS artifact restoration evaluation, we present DL3DV-Res which\ncontains artifact frames rendered using low-quality 3DGS. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate our GSFixer outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in 3DGS\nartifact restoration and sparse-view 3D reconstruction.

On MNIST (60k train, 10k test) and Fashion-MNIST (60k\ntrain, 10k test), our method reaches 97.8% and 89.3% test accuracy on the\nofficial 10k test sets, respectively, in 3.9s--4.5s using approximately 130k\ntrainable parameters and only 250 epochs on an RTX 5060 (16GB). We provide a\nmulti-layer extension (optimised activations at each hidden stage), learnable\nridge parameters, optional PCA/PLS projections, and theory linking the\ncondition number of prototype matrices to generalisation.

We propose NEURAL, a novel framework that addresses this by\nusing semantics-guided data compression. Our approach repurposes\ncross-attention scores between the image and its radiological report from a\nfine-tuned generative vision-language model to structurally prune chest X-rays,\npreserving only diagnostically critical regions. This process transforms the\nimage into a highly compressed, graph representation. This unified graph-based\nrepresentation fuses the pruned visual graph with a knowledge graph derived\nfrom the clinical report, creating a universal data structure that simplifies\ndownstream modeling. Validated on the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus dataset for\npneumonia detection, NEURAL achieves a 93.4-97.7\\% reduction in image data size\nwhile maintaining a high diagnostic performance of 0.88-0.95 AUC, outperforming\nother baseline models that use uncompressed data.

At the field-scale,\nthis predictive soil modeling (PSM) task is typically constrained by small\ntraining sample sizes and high feature-to-sample ratios in soil spectroscopy.\nTraditionally, these conditions have proven challenging for conventional deep\nlearning methods. Classical machine learning algorithms, particularly\ntree-based models like Random Forest and linear models such as Partial Least\nSquares Regression, have long been the default choice for field-scale PSM.\nRecent advances in artificial neural networks (ANN) for tabular data challenge\nthis view, yet their suitability for field-scale PSM has not been proven. We\nintroduce a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates state-of-the-art ANN\narchitectures, including the latest multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based models\n(TabM, RealMLP), attention-based transformer variants (FT-Transformer,\nExcelFormer, T2G-Former, AMFormer), retrieval-augmented approaches (TabR,\nModernNCA), and an in-context learning foundation model (TabPFN). Our\nevaluation encompasses 31 field- and farm-scale datasets containing 30 to 460\nsamples and three critical soil properties: soil organic matter or soil organic\ncarbon, pH, and clay content.

However, transposed convolution (a.k.a. deconvolution) does\nnot serve as a true inverse of convolution due to inherent differences in their\nmathematical formulations. To date, no reverse convolution operator has been\nestablished as a standard component in neural architectures. In this paper, we\npropose a novel depthwise reverse convolution operator as an initial attempt to\neffectively reverse depthwise convolution by formulating and solving a\nregularized least-squares optimization problem. We thoroughly investigate its\nkernel initialization, padding strategies, and other critical aspects to ensure\nits effective implementation. Building upon this operator, we further construct\na reverse convolution block by combining it with layer normalization,\n1$\\times$1 convolution, and GELU activation, forming a Transformer-like\nstructure. The proposed operator and block can directly replace conventional\nconvolution and transposed convolution layers in existing architectures,\nleading to the development of ConverseNet.

Given the easier training and superior\nperformance of continuous VAEs, an intuitive idea is to enhance discrete video\nVAEs by leveraging continuous VAEs. After rethinking the intrinsic link between\ndiscrete and continuous representations, we found that FSQ could effectively\npreserve pre-trained continuous VAE priors compared to other quantization\nmethods. By leveraging continuous VAE priors, it converges several times faster\nthan training from scratch and achieves superior performance at convergence.\nMeanwhile, two structural improvements are proposed. First, inspired by how\ncontinuous VAEs enhance reconstruction via enlarged latent dimensions, we\nintroduce a multi-token quantization mechanism, which achieves nearly a 1 dB\nimprovement in PSNR without compromising the token compression ratio.

Crucially, it incorporates a\nnovel Sparse Motion Dictionary that enables the model to disentangle facial\ndynamics into interpretable factors. Deviating from previous 'warp-render'\napproaches, the interpretability of the Sparse Motion Dictionary allows LIA-X\nto support a highly controllable 'edit-warp-render' strategy, enabling precise\nmanipulation of fine-grained facial semantics in the source portrait. This\nhelps to narrow initial differences with the driving video in terms of pose and\nexpression. Moreover, we demonstrate the scalability of LIA-X by successfully\ntraining a large-scale model with approximately 1 billion parameters on\nextensive datasets.

To address\nthese issues, recent works have proposed training-free compression methods.\nHowever, existing efforts often suffer from three major limitations: (1)\nCurrent approaches do not decompose techniques into comparable modules,\nhindering fair evaluation across spatial and temporal redundancy. (2)\nEvaluation confined to simple single-turn tasks, failing to reflect performance\nin realistic scenarios. (3) Isolated use of individual compression techniques,\nwithout exploring their joint potential. To overcome these gaps, we introduce\nLLMC+, a comprehensive VLM compression benchmark with a versatile,\nplug-and-play toolkit. LLMC+ supports over 20 algorithms across five\nrepresentative VLM families and enables systematic study of token-level and\nmodel-level compression. Our benchmark reveals that: (1) Spatial and temporal\nredundancies demand distinct technical strategies. (2) Token reduction methods\ndegrade significantly in multi-turn dialogue and detail-sensitive tasks. (3)\nCombining token and model compression achieves extreme compression with minimal\nperformance loss. We believe LLMC+ will facilitate fair evaluation and inspire\nfuture research in efficient VLM.
