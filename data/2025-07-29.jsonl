Two canonical\nflows--fully-developed turbulent channel flow and periodic hill flow--are\nselected for analysis. The eddy viscosity predicted by this model correlates\nwell with the visualized vortices and exhibits an asymptotic behavior of O(y)\nnear the walls. The dimensionless eddy viscosity, like that of the\nWall-Adapting Local Eddy Viscosity (WALE) subgrid model, remains within a small\nnumerical range of 10^-2 to 10^-4. The power spectral density results reveal\nthe asymptotic behavior of the velocity scale in the dissipation range,\nfollowing a -10/3 scaling law.

At low Froude and high Bond\nnumbers, conditions relevant to geophysical and astrophysical flows, we\nidentify a novel transition in the fastest growing mode: from Kelvin Helmholtz\n(KH) instability at high density ratio (delta = 0.9), to Holmboe (H)\ninstability as delta approaches 0.5, and ultimately to the Miles (1957)\ncritical layer instability as delta approaches 0.001, representative of the air\nwater system. Remarkably, the Miles mode, characterized by a sharp jump in\ninviscid Reynolds stress (tau) at the critical layer, persists up to delta =\n0.01, i.e., ten times the air water value. As delta increases, the vertical\nvariation of tau undergoes a qualitative change, from a sharp jump at the\ncritical layer for delta much less than 1 to a smooth transition through it for\ndelta greater than or equal to 0.5. A theoretical explanation is provided. In\nthe moderate to high density ratio regime, comparison with a piecewise-linear\n(PL) velocity profile confirms the presence of both H and KH instabilities in\nthe exponential profile. Nonlinear simulations of the incompressible Euler\nequations with gravity and surface tension show excellent agreement with linear\ntheory for delta = 0.01 up to five wave periods.

At delta = 0.9, the waves rapidly evolve into\nclassic KH spirals. Comparisons with the PL profile highlight the role of\nbackground curvature and the critical layer.

The convective dynamics is\ncompared in homogeneous, horizontally stratified, vertically stratified, and\nlog-normally distributed permeability fields. Key variables, such as the total\namount of product, mixing length, front position and width, reaction and scalar\ndissipation rates, and dissolution fluxes, are strongly influenced by the type\nof permeability heterogeneity. Vertically stratified and log-normally\ndistributed permeability fields lead to larger values for all parameters\ncompared to homogeneous fields.

In\ntheir experiments SwiftTD outperformed True Online TD($\\lambda$) and\nTD($\\lambda$) on a variety of prediction tasks derived from Atari games, and\nits performance was robust to the choice of hyper-parameters. In this extended\nabstract we extend SwiftTD to work for control problems. We combine the key\nideas behind SwiftTD with True Online Sarsa($\\lambda$) to develop an on-policy\nreinforcement learning algorithm called $\\textit{Swift-Sarsa}$.\n  We propose a simple benchmark for linear on-policy control called the\n$\\textit{operant conditioning benchmark}$. The key challenge in the operant\nconditioning benchmark is that a very small subset of input signals are\nrelevant for decision making. The majority of the signals are noise sampled\nfrom a non-stationary distribution. To learn effectively, the agent must learn\nto differentiate between the relevant signals and the noisy signals, and\nminimize prediction errors by assigning credit to the weight parameters\nassociated with the relevant signals.\n  Swift-Sarsa, when applied to the operant conditioning benchmark, learned to\nassign credit to the relevant signals without any prior knowledge of the\nstructure of the problem. It opens the door for solution methods that learn\nrepresentations by searching over hundreds of millions of features in parallel\nwithout performance degradation due to noisy or bad features."}

To address this problem,\nwe propose a novel value-based method, named Concepts learning for Multi-agent\nQ-learning (CMQ), that goes beyond the current performance-vs-interpretability\ntrade-off by learning interpretable cooperation concepts. CMQ represents each\ncooperation concept as a supervised vector, as opposed to existing models where\nthe information flowing through their end-to-end mechanism is concept-agnostic.\nIntuitively, using individual action value conditioning on global state\nembeddings to represent each concept allows for extra cooperation\nrepresentation capacity.

The direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulence proposed by\nOrszag in 1970 is a milestone in fluid mechanics, which began an era of\nnumerical experiment for turbulence. Many researchers have reported that\nturbulence should be chaotic, since spatiotemporal trajectories are very\nsensitive to small disturbance. In 2006 E.D. Lorenz discovered that numerical\nnoise might have a great influence on statistic characteristics of chaotic\nsystems. The above-mentioned facts logically lead to the conclusion that\nnumerical noises of turbulence (as a chaotic system) might have great influence\non turbulent flows. This is indeed true for a two-dimensional (2D) Kolmogorov\nturbulent flow, as currently revealed by a much more accurate algorithm than\nDNS, namely the ``clean numerical simulation'' (CNS). Different from DNS, CNS\ncan greatly reduce both of truncation error and round-off error to any required\nsmall level so that artificial numerical noise can be rigorously negligible\nthroughout a time interval long enough for calculating statistics. However, In\nphysics, 3D turbulent flow is more important than 2D turbulence, as pointed out\nby Nobel Prize winner T.D. Lee. So, for the first time, we solve a 3D turbulent\nKolmogorov flow by means of CNS in this paper, and compare our CNS result with\nthat given by DNS in details. It is found that the spatial-temporal\ntrajectories of the 3D Kolmogorov turbulent flow given by DNS are badly\npolluted by artificial numerical noise rather quickly, and the DNS result has\nhuge deviations from the CNS benchmark solution not only in the flow field and\nthe energy cascade but also even in statistics."}

The system delivers\nseveral building blocks: a framework for planning and optimizing agentic AI\nexecution graphs using cost models that account for compute, memory, and\nbandwidth constraints of different HW; a MLIR based representation and\ncompilation system that can decompose AI agent execution graphs into granular\noperators and generate code for different HW options; and a dynamic\norchestration system that can place the granular components across a\nheterogeneous compute infrastructure and stitch them together while meeting an\nend-to-end SLA.

This separation\nmaximizes the distinction between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images.\nAdditionally, we introduce image-conditional learnable factors through a\nlightweight meta-network, enabling dynamic adaptation to individual images and\nmitigating sensitivity to class and style shifts. Compared to traditional\nnegative prompt tuning, NFT demonstrates superior efficiency and scalability.\nTo optimize this adaptation architecture, the KR optimization strategy is\ndesigned to enhance the discrimination between ID and OOD sets while mitigating\npre-trained knowledge forgetting. This enhances OOD detection performance on\ntrained ID classes while simultaneously improving OOD detection on unseen ID\ndatasets. Notably, when trained with few-shot samples from ImageNet dataset,\nKR-NFT not only improves ID classification accuracy and OOD detection but also\nsignificantly reduces the FPR95 by 5.44\\% under an unexplored generalization\nsetting with unseen ID categories.

Evaluating these capabilities is\nbecoming crucial yet remains challenging. Existing benchmarks mostly adopt a\n\\textbf{character-centric} approach, simplify user-character interactions to\nisolated Q&A tasks, and fail to reflect real-world applications. To address\nthis limitation, we introduce RMTBench, a comprehensive \\textbf{user-centric}\nbilingual role-playing benchmark featuring 80 diverse characters and over 8,000\ndialogue rounds. RMTBench includes custom characters with detailed backgrounds\nand abstract characters defined by simple traits, enabling evaluation across\nvarious user scenarios. Our benchmark constructs dialogues based on explicit\nuser motivations rather than character descriptions, ensuring alignment with\npractical user applications. Furthermore, we construct an authentic multi-turn\ndialogue simulation mechanism. With carefully selected evaluation dimensions\nand LLM-based scoring, this mechanism captures the complex intention of\nconversations between the user and the character.

However,\nthe simple reweighing technique cannot explore the latent structure and\nsufficiently use the labeled data, and then models are prone to over-fitting on\nthe source domain. In this work, we propose a novel importance sampling-based\nshift correction (IS$^2$C) method, where new labeled data are sampled from a\nbuilt sampling domain, whose label distribution is supposed to be the same as\nthe target domain, to characterize the latent structure and enhance the\ngeneralization ability of the model.

In\nthis paper, aligned with the sensory-decision-motor (SDM) flow of the human\nbrain, we propose a real-time 3D crowd evacuation simulation framework that\nintegrates a 3D-adaptive SFM (Social Force Model) Decision Mechanism and a\nPersonalized Gait Control Motor. This framework allows multiple agents to move\nin parallel and is suitable for various scenarios, with dynamic crowd\nawareness. Additionally, we introduce Part-level Force Visualization to assist\nin evacuation analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework\nsupports dynamic trajectory planning and personalized behavior for each agent\nthroughout the evacuation process, and is compatible with uneven terrain.\nVisually, our method generates evacuation results that are more realistic and\nplausible, providing enhanced insights for crowd simulation.

Moreover, we introduce a new momentum-based stochastic\ncontrolled weight averaging FL algorithm (\\texttt{FedMoSWA}), which is designed\nto better align local and global models.\n  Theoretically, we provide both convergence analysis and generalization bounds\nfor \\texttt{FedSWA} and \\texttt{FedMoSWA}. We also prove that the optimization\nand generalization errors of \\texttt{FedMoSWA} are smaller than those of their\ncounterparts, including FedSAM and its variants. Empirically, experimental\nresults on CIFAR10/100 and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of the\nproposed algorithms compared to their counterparts.

While approximate unlearning algorithms offer\nefficient alternatives to full retraining, this work reveals that they fail to\nadequately protect the privacy of unlearned data. In particular, these\nalgorithms introduce implicit residuals which facilitate privacy attacks\ntargeting at unlearned data. We observe that these residuals persist regardless\nof model architectures, parameters, and unlearning algorithms, exposing a new\nattack surface beyond conventional output-based leakage. Based on this insight,\nwe propose the Reminiscence Attack (ReA), which amplifies the correlation\nbetween residuals and membership privacy through targeted fine-tuning\nprocesses. ReA achieves up to 1.90x and 1.12x higher accuracy than prior\nattacks when inferring class-wise and sample-wise membership, respectively.

Statistical models based on\nwell-defined evolutionary concepts can be used to validate different hypotheses\nabout empirical observations. Despite their popularity, classic statistical\nmodels like the Wright-Fisher model suffer from simplified assumptions such as\nthe independence of selected loci along a chromosome and uncertainty about the\nparameters. Deep generative neural networks offer a powerful alternative known\nfor the integration of multivariate dependencies and noise reduction. Due to\ntheir high data demands and challenging interpretability they have, so far, not\nbeen widely considered in the area of population genomics. To address the\nchallenges in the area of Evolve and Resequencing experiments (E&R) based on\npooled sequencing (Pool-Seq) data, we introduce a deep generative neural\nnetwork that aims to model a concept of evolution based on empirical\nobservations over time. The proposed model estimates the distribution of allele\nfrequency trajectories by embedding the observations from single nucleotide\npolymorphisms (SNPs) with information from neighboring loci. Evaluation on\nsimulated E&R experiments demonstrates the model's ability to capture the\ndistribution of allele frequency trajectories and illustrates the\nrepresentational power of deep generative models on the example of linkage\ndisequilibrium (LD) estimation. Inspecting the internally learned\nrepresentations enables estimating pairwise LD, which is typically inaccessible\nin Pool-Seq data. Our model provides competitive LD estimation in Pool-Seq data\nhigh degree of LD when compared to existing methods."}

This model effectively evaluates and filters\npotential training samples based on caption and image quality and alignment.\nUnlike previous approaches, which typically add auxiliary filtration modules on\ntop of existing full-scale VLMs, our method exclusively utilizes the inherent\nevaluative capability of a purpose-built small VLM. This strategy eliminates\nthe need for extra modules and reduces training overhead. Our lightweight model\nefficiently filters out inaccurate, noisy web data, improving image-text\nalignment and caption linguistic fluency. Experimental results show that\ndatasets underwent high-precision filtration using our compact VLM perform on\npar with, or even surpass, larger and noisier datasets gathered through\nhigh-volume web crawling. Thus, our method provides a lightweight yet robust\nsolution for building high-quality vision-language training corpora. \\\\\n\\textbf{Availability and implementation:} Our compact VLM filtration model,\ntraining data, utility scripts, and Supplementary data (Appendices) are freely\navailable at https://github.com/daulettoibazar/Compact_VLM_Filter."}

We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that, given just\na few pre-clustered examples, the model can generalize to accurately cluster\nthe rest of the dataset.

We\nconducted comprehensive ablation studies comparing global and local embeddings\nfrom ProteinBERT and conventional one-hot encoding.

This study offers a dual-path architecture\ncalled the Dual-Branch Adaptive Multiscale Spatiotemporal Framework (DAMS),\nwhich is based on multilevel feature decoupling and fusion, enabling efficient\nanomaly detection modeling by integrating hierarchical feature learning and\ncomplementary information. The main processing path of this framework\nintegrates the Adaptive Multiscale Time Pyramid Network (AMTPN) with the\nConvolutional Block Attention Mechanism (CBAM).

Consequently, we\nformulated a research question regarding the evaluation metrics of the\nevaluation diagnostics benchmarks: \"Why do not we have an evaluation standard\nfor the NLU evaluation diagnostics benchmarks?\" similar to ISO standard in\nindustry.

Despite\nthese advances in practice, most theoretical work pertains to finite state and\naction spaces. We propose building a theoretical understanding of continuous\nstate and action spaces by employing a geometric lens to understand the locally\nattained set of states. The set of all parametrised policies learnt through a\nsemi-gradient based approach induces a set of attainable states in RL. We show\nthat the training dynamics of a two-layer neural policy induce a low\ndimensional manifold of attainable states embedded in the high-dimensional\nnominal state space trained using an actor-critic algorithm. We prove that,\nunder certain conditions, the dimensionality of this manifold is of the order\nof the dimensionality of the action space. This is the first result of its\nkind, linking the geometry of the state space to the dimensionality of the\naction space.

Camera\nparameters, such as exposure time, also influence the appearance of snowflakes,\nmaking the problem difficult to solve and heavily dependent on network\ngeneralization. In this paper, we propose to address the challenge of desnowing\nby using event cameras, which offer compressed visual information with\nsubmillisecond latency, making them ideal for de-snowing images, even in the\npresence of ego-motion. Our method leverages the fact that snowflake occlusions\nappear with a very distinctive streak signature in the spatio-temporal\nrepresentation of event data.

As MLLMs evolve from narrow, monolingual, task-specific systems to\ngeneral-purpose instruction-following models, a key frontier lies in evaluating\ntheir multilingual and multimodal capabilities over both long and short\ncontexts. However, existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these\ndimensions jointly: they are often limited to English, mostly focus on one\nsingle modality at a time, rely on short-form contexts, or lack human\nannotations -- hindering comprehensive assessment of model performance across\nlanguages, modalities, and task complexity. To address these gaps, we introduce\nMCIF (Multimodal Crosslingual Instruction Following), the first multilingual\nhuman-annotated benchmark based on scientific talks that is designed to\nevaluate instruction-following in crosslingual, multimodal settings over both\nshort- and long-form inputs. MCIF spans three core modalities -- speech,\nvision, and text -- and four diverse languages (English, German, Italian, and\nChinese), enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs' abilities to interpret\ninstructions across languages and combine them with multimodal contextual\ninformation. MCIF is released under a CC-BY 4.0 license to encourage open\nresearch and progress in MLLMs development."}

Current parameter reduction\ntechniques primarily involve training MLLMs from Small Language Models (SLMs),\nbut these methods offer limited flexibility and remain computationally\nintensive. To address this gap, we propose to directly compress existing MLLMs\nthrough structural pruning combined with efficient recovery training.\nSpecifically, we investigate two structural pruning paradigms--layerwise and\nwidthwise pruning--applied to the language model backbone of MLLMs, alongside\nsupervised finetuning and knowledge distillation. Additionally, we assess the\nfeasibility of conducting recovery training with only a small fraction of the\navailable data. Our results show that widthwise pruning generally maintains\nbetter performance in low-resource scenarios with limited computational\nresources or insufficient finetuning data. As for the recovery training,\nfinetuning only the multimodal projector is sufficient at small compression\nlevels (< 20%). Furthermore, a combination of supervised finetuning and\nhidden-state distillation yields optimal recovery across various pruning\nlevels.

Unlike prior approaches\nthat rely on CLIP-based filtering or prompt engineering, which often require\nmodel-specific adjustments and offer limited control, SAE Debias operates\ndirectly within the feature space without retraining or architectural\nmodifications. By leveraging a k-sparse autoencoder pre-trained on a gender\nbias dataset, the method identifies gender-relevant directions within the\nsparse latent space, capturing professional stereotypes.
