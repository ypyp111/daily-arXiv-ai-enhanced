At each time step, the resulting saddle point system becomes nearly\nsingular in the locking regime, where the solid is nearly incompressible. This\nnear-singularity stems from the leading block, which corresponds to a linear\nelasticity system. To enable efficient iterative solution, this nearly singular\nsystem is first reformulated as a saddle point problem and then regularized by\nadding a term to the (2,2) block. This regularization preserves the solution\nwhile ensuring the non-singularity of the new system. As a result, block Schur\ncomplement preconditioning becomes effective. It is shown that the\npreconditioned MINRES and GMRES converge essentially independent of the mesh\nsize and the locking parameter. Both two- and three-field formulations are\nconsidered for the iterative solution of the linear poroelasticity. The\nefficient solution of the two-field formulation builds upon the effective\niterative solution of linear elasticity. For this case, MINRES and GMRES\nachieve parameter-free convergence when used with block Schur complement\npreconditioning, where the inverse of the leading block leverages efficient\nsolvers for linear elasticity. The poroelasticity problem can also be\nreformulated as a three-field system by introducing a numerical pressure\nvariable into the linear elasticity part. The inherent regularization strategy\nextends naturally to this formulation, and preconditioned MINRES and GMRES also\nshow parameter-free convergence for the regularized system. Numerical\nexperiments in both two and three dimensions confirm the effectiveness of the\nregularization strategy and the robustness of the block preconditioners."}

This pipeline outperforms two widely used\nsyntactic parsers across multiple evaluation datasets. Furthermore, it requires\nfar fewer resources than manual parsing (the gold-standard), thereby enabling\nrapid, scalable VFF estimation. Using the LLM parser, we produce a new VFF\ndatabase with broader verb coverage, finer-grained syntactic distinctions, and\nexplicit estimates of the relative frequencies of structural alternates\ncommonly studied in psycholinguistics.

Unlike fleeting emotions, personality traits are\nstable, often subconsciously leaked through language, facial expressions, and\nbody behaviors, with asynchronous patterns across modalities. It was hard to\nmodel personality semantics with traditional superficial features and seemed\nimpossible to achieve effective cross-modal understanding. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel personality assessment framework called\n\\textit{\\textbf{Traits Run Deep}}. It employs\n\\textit{\\textbf{psychology-informed prompts}} to elicit high-level\npersonality-relevant semantic representations. Besides, it devises a\n\\textit{\\textbf{Text-Centric Trait Fusion Network}} that anchors rich text\nsemantics to align and integrate asynchronous signals from other modalities. To\nbe specific, such fusion module includes a Chunk-Wise Projector to decrease\ndimensionality, a Cross-Modal Connector and a Text Feature Enhancer for\neffective modality fusion and an ensemble regression head to improve\ngeneralization in data-scarce situations. To our knowledge, we are the first to\napply personality-specific prompts to guide large language models (LLMs) in\nextracting personality-aware semantics for improved representation quality.\nFurthermore, extracting and fusing audio-visual apparent behavior features\nfurther improves the accuracy.

To tackle this problem, we propose FaceGCD, a method\nthat dynamically constructs instance-specific feature extractors using\nlightweight, layer-wise prefixes. These prefixes are generated on the fly by a\nHyperNetwork, which adaptively outputs a set of prefix generators conditioned\non each input image. This dynamic design enables FaceGCD to capture subtle\nidentity-specific cues without relying on high-capacity static models.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that FaceGCD significantly outperforms\nexisting GCD methods and a strong face recognition baseline, ArcFace, achieving\nstate-of-the-art results on the GFD task and advancing toward open-world face\nrecognition."}

This motivates us to leverage the diffusion prior, one of the most\npowerful natural image priors. However, while the diffusion prior can help\ngenerate visually plausible results, using it to restore task-relevant details\nremains challenging, even when combined with recent TDIR methods. To address\nthis, we propose EDTR, which effectively harnesses the power of diffusion prior\nto restore task-relevant details. Specifically, we propose directly leveraging\nuseful clues from LQ images in the diffusion process by generating from\npixel-error-based pre-restored LQ images with mild noise added. Moreover, we\nemploy a small number of denoising steps to prevent the generation of redundant\ndetails that dilute crucial task-related information. We demonstrate that our\nmethod effectively utilizes diffusion prior for TDIR, significantly enhancing\ntask performance and visual quality across diverse tasks with multiple complex\ndegradations."}

To address these issue, we propose\nSpectral-based Spatial Grouping Transformer (SSGformer), a novel approach that\nleverages spectral decomposition and group-wise attention for multi-weather\nimage restoration. SSGformer decomposes images into high-frequency edge\nfeatures using conventional edge detection and low-frequency information via\nSingular Value Decomposition. We utilize multi-head linear attention to\neffectively model the relationship between these features. The fused features\nare integrated with the input to generate a grouping-mask that clusters regions\nbased on the spatial similarity and image texture. To fully leverage this mask,\nwe introduce a group-wise attention mechanism, enabling robust adverse weather\nremoval and ensuring consistent performance across diverse weather conditions.\nWe also propose a Spatial Grouping Transformer Block that uses both channel\nattention and spatial attention, effectively balancing feature-wise\nrelationships and spatial dependencies.

Consequently, practitioners are forced either to over-spend privacy\nbudget in pursuit of utility, or to accept mediocre models in order to stay\nwithin privacy constraints. We present RLDP, the first framework to cast DP\noptimization itself as a closed-loop control problem amenable to modern deep\nreinforcement learning (RL).

We introduce\nGenerative Active Learning for Trajectory prediction (GALTraj), the first\nmethod to successfully deploy generative active learning into trajectory\nprediction. It actively identifies rare tail samples where the model fails and\naugments these samples with a controllable diffusion model during training. In\nour framework, generating scenarios that are diverse, realistic, and preserve\ntail-case characteristics is paramount. Accordingly, we design a tail-aware\ngeneration method that applies tailored diffusion guidance to generate\ntrajectories that both capture rare behaviors and respect traffic rules. Unlike\nprior simulation methods focused solely on scenario diversity, GALTraj is the\nfirst to show how simulator-driven augmentation benefits long-tail learning in\ntrajectory prediction.

Specifically, we\nutilize a new high-quality deepfake dataset comprising 60,000 images, on which\nour zero-shot models demonstrate superior performance to almost all existing\nmethods. Subsequently, we compare the performance of the best-performing\narchitecture, InstructBLIP, on the popular deepfake dataset DFDC-P against\ntraditional methods in two scenarios: zero-shot and in-domain fine-tuning. Our\nresults demonstrate the superiority of VLMs over traditional classifiers."}

To reduce the\ncomputational complexity of fractional-order differential operations, we\nintroduce Gr\\\"unwald-Letnikov fractional derivatives to approximate the\nfractional-order differential equation. The number of parameters for each\nkernel in FGF is minimized to only seven. Beyond the architecture of Fractional\nGaussian Filters, our FGFP framework also incorporates Adaptive Unstructured\nPruning (AUP) to achieve higher compression ratios. Experiments on various\narchitectures and benchmarks show that our FGFP framework outperforms recent\nmethods in accuracy and compression. On CIFAR-10, ResNet-20 achieves only a\n1.52% drop in accuracy while reducing the model size by 85.2%. On ImageNet2012,\nResNet-50 achieves only a 1.63% drop in accuracy while reducing the model size\nby 69.1%."}
