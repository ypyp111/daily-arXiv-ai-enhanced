This trait, often dubbed \"free will\" in a loose sense, might\nbe crucial for creativity, robust adaptation, and avoiding ruts in\nproblem-solving. This paper proposes a theoretical framework, called the Free\nWill Equation, that draws analogies from quantum field theory to endow AGI\nagents with a form of adaptive, controlled stochasticity in their\ndecision-making process. The core idea is to treat an AI agent's cognitive\nstate as a superposition of potential actions or thoughts, which collapses\nprobabilistically into a concrete action when a decision is made - much like a\nquantum wavefunction collapsing upon measurement. By incorporating mechanisms\nanalogous to quantum fields, along with intrinsic motivation terms, we aim to\nimprove an agent's ability to explore novel strategies and adapt to unforeseen\nchanges.

Orientation 3 achieves the highest heat transfer rate, with an average\nNusselt number of $21.05$ at $Ha=25$, $Ri=5$, and consistently outperforms the\nother orientations in heat transfer across various $Ha$ and $Ri$ conditions.\nThese findings highlight the strong coupling between wake dynamics and heat\ntransfer, offering insights for optimizing MHD flows in practical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u78c1\u573a\u4e0b\u5bfc\u7535\u6d41\u4f53\u5728\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\u68f1\u67f1\u95f4\u7684\u6d41\u52a8\u548c\u4f20\u70ed\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4f4e\u54c8\u7279\u66fc\u6570\u4e0b\u969c\u788d\u7269\u53d6\u5411\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u5bf9\u6d41\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u78c1\u573a\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u5bf9\u6d41\u5bf9\u4e09\u7ef4MHD\u6d41\u52a8\u548c\u4f20\u70ed\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528OpenFOAM\u4e2d\u7684MHD\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u4e09\u7ef4\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u68f1\u67f1\u53d6\u5411\u3001\u7406\u67e5\u5fb7\u68ee\u6570\u548c\u54c8\u7279\u66fc\u6570\u5bf9\u6d41\u52a8\u548c\u4f20\u70ed\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9ad8\u54c8\u7279\u66fc\u6570\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6d41\u52a8\uff0c\u9ad8\u7406\u67e5\u5fb7\u68ee\u6570\u589e\u5f3a\u4e09\u7ef4\u6027\uff1b\u68f1\u67f1\u53d6\u54113\u5728\u4f20\u70ed\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6d41\u52a8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u4f20\u70ed\u7684\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3aMHD\u6d41\u52a8\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

However, accurately tracking tissue motion in B-mode ultrasound\nremains challenging due to speckle noise, low edge contrast, and out-of-plane\nmovement.

This manuscript introduces DUSTrack (Deep learning\nand optical flow-based toolkit for UltraSound Tracking), a semi-automated\nframework for tracking arbitrary points in B-mode ultrasound videos. We combine\ndeep learning with optical flow to deliver high-quality and robust tracking\nacross diverse anatomical structures and motion patterns. The toolkit includes\na graphical user interface that streamlines the generation of high-quality\ntraining data and supports iterative model refinement. It also implements a\nnovel optical-flow-based filtering technique that reduces high-frequency\nframe-to-frame noise while preserving rapid tissue motion. DUSTrack\ndemonstrates superior accuracy compared to contemporary zero-shot point\ntrackers and performs on par with specialized methods, establishing its\npotential as a general and foundational tool for clinical and biomechanical\nresearch. We demonstrate DUSTrack's versatility through three use cases:\ncardiac wall motion tracking in echocardiograms, muscle deformation analysis\nduring reaching tasks, and fascicle tracking during ankle plantarflexion.

Specifically, for continuous integration of new LLMs and\ngeneralization to diverse questions, we first propose a Retrieval-based Prior\nSelection (RPS), which assigns a proxy performance score to each LLM to select\nthe Top-k LLMs at the instance level for any given question. Then, we propose\nan Exploration-Exploitation-Driven Posterior Enhancement (EPE), encouraging the\ngeneration of diverse responses through prior dropping and selecting the\nhigh-quality response via a hybrid posterior score. Experiments on eight\nmainstream benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our SMACS: by integrating\nfifteen open-source LLMs, SMACS outperforms leading closed-source LLMs in 2025,\ne.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet (+12.73%), GPT-4.1(+5.36%) and GPT-o3-mini(+5.28%)\nacross multiple tasks. Remarkably, it even exceeds the average of best results\nof different datasets from both open-source LLMs (+2.86%) and closed-source\nLLMs (+2.04%), pushing the upper bound of intelligence.

In particular, our analysis demonstrates that a damped\noscillatory system may be incorrectly identified as having \"anti-damping\" and\nexhibiting a reversed oscillation direction, despite adequately fitting the\ngiven data points.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6848\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u4ece\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u6790\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6848\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6848\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u8bc6\u522b\u963b\u5c3c\u632f\u8361\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u53cd\u963b\u5c3c\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

Additionally, we demonstrate how PoliAnalyzer can\nmodel diverse user data-sharing preferences, derived from prior research as 23\nuser profiles, and perform compliance analysis against the top 100 most-visited\nwebsites.

Traditional\npredictive models often rely on unimodal data or early fusion strategies that\nfail to capture the complex, multimodal nature of psychiatric data. Advanced\nintegration techniques, such as intermediate (latent space) fusion, may offer\nbetter accuracy and clinical utility. Methods: Using data from the BRIGHTEN\nclinical trial, we evaluated intermediate (latent space) fusion for predicting\ndaily depressive symptoms (PHQ-2 scores). We compared early fusion implemented\nwith a Random Forest (RF) model and intermediate fusion implemented via a\nCombined Model (CM) using autoencoders and a neural network. The dataset\nincluded behavioral (smartphone-based), demographic, and clinical features.\nExperiments were conducted across multiple temporal splits and data stream\ncombinations. Performance was evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) and\ncoefficient of determination (R2). Results: The CM outperformed both RF and\nLinear Regression (LR) baselines across all setups, achieving lower MSE (0.4985\nvs. 0.5305 with RF) and higher R2 (0.4695 vs. 0.4356). The RF model showed\nsigns of overfitting, with a large gap between training and test performance,\nwhile the CM maintained consistent generalization. Performance was best when\nintegrating all data modalities in the CM (in contradistinction to RF),\nunderscoring the value of latent space fusion for capturing non-linear\ninteractions in complex psychiatric datasets. Conclusion: Latent space fusion\noffers a robust alternative to traditional fusion methods for prediction with\nmultimodal mental health data.

The system makes use of\nan arrangement where a laser beam is first laterally deflected using an\neven-faced prism, and then passed through a cylindrical lens rod to obtain\nlight sheets for illumination. This eliminates the need for large rotating\nmirrors or heavy prisms and facilitates relatively fast rotation speeds of up\nto 4800 rpm for the prism, yielding three-dimensional, three-component velocity\nfield over a large depth at relatively high particle seeding density. About\n$10^6$ velocity vectors (3D-3C) are obtained in a single volumetric-scan of\n$100 \\times 100 \\times 100$ mm$^3$. The method is demonstrated using two\nindependent experiments, (1) a round jet at Reynolds number Re = 1000, and (2)\nthe flow field around a freely rising sphere at a Reynolds number Re$_p$\n$\\approx$ 260, and the wake flow is compared with direct numerical simulations\nof a falling viscous droplet.

This paper\nintroduces the concept of Predictive Representativity (PR), a framework of\nfairness auditing that shifts the focus from the composition of the data set to\noutcomes-level equity. Through a case study in dermatology, we evaluated\nAI-based skin cancer classifiers trained on the widely used HAM10000 dataset\nand on an independent clinical dataset (BOSQUE Test set) from Colombia. Our\nanalysis reveals substantial performance disparities by skin phototype, with\nclassifiers consistently underperforming for individuals with darker skin,\ndespite proportional sampling in the source data. We argue that\nrepresentativity must be understood not as a static feature of datasets but as\na dynamic, context-sensitive property of model predictions. PR operationalizes\nthis shift by quantifying how reliably models generalize fairness across\nsubpopulations and deployment contexts.

However, little is\nknown about how LLMs use this information in their decision-making in\nreal-world applications. We perform the first comprehensive analysis of how\nidentity markers present in a user's writing bias LLM responses across five\ndifferent high-stakes LLM applications in the domains of medicine, law,\npolitics, government benefits, and job salaries. We find that LLMs are\nextremely sensitive to markers of identity in user queries and that race,\ngender, and age consistently influence LLM responses in these applications. For\ninstance, when providing medical advice, we find that models apply different\nstandards of care to individuals of different ethnicities for the same\nsymptoms; we find that LLMs are more likely to alter answers to align with a\nconservative (liberal) political worldview when asked factual questions by\nolder (younger) individuals; and that LLMs recommend lower salaries for\nnon-White job applicants and higher salaries for women compared to men.

However, it is extremely\nchallenging to handle the fusion of local and global features due to feature\nredundancy and complex spatial relationships. Given that Gestalt principles\nprovide key advantages in analyzing local and global relationships, we propose\na novel Gestalt-guided Parallel Interaction Network via orthogonal geometric\nconsistency (GPI-Net) in this paper. It utilizes Gestalt principles to\nfacilitate complementary communication between local and global information.\nSpecifically, we introduce an orthogonal integration strategy to optimally\nreduce redundant information and generate a more compact global structure for\nhigh-quality correspondences. To capture geometric features in correspondences,\nwe leverage a Gestalt Feature Attention (GFA) block through a hybrid\nutilization of self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms.

Finite amplitude equilibria", "comment": null, "summary": "Streamwise roll circulations commonly observed in frontal regions are primary\nagents of momentum and tracer transport in the planetary boundary layer (PBL)\nboth in the atmosphere and ocean. Traditionally, the formation of the\nstreamwise roll/streak structure (RSS) has been ascribed to symmetric\ninstability (SI). In part 1, we studied RSS formation in the classical Eady\nfront problem using statistical state dynamics (SSD), which allows\nincorporating the Reynolds stress (RS) torque instability mechanism together\nwith SI in the dynamics underlying RSS formation. We found using SSD theory\nthat the RS torque mechanism acts synergistically with the SI mechanism in\nforcing symmetric circulations in fronts when Richardson number Ri < 1, and\nalso that the turbulence-mediated RS torque mechanism supports RSS formation in\nfronts with Ri > 1 for which the SI mechanism does not operate.

Although this sparsity\npresents opportunities to reduce computational cost, efficiently utilizing it\nrequires predicting activation patterns in a scalable manner. However, direct\nprediction at the neuron level is computationally expensive due to the vast\nnumber of neurons in modern LLMs. To enable efficient prediction and\nutilization of activation sparsity, we propose a clustering-based activation\npattern compression framework. Instead of treating each neuron independently,\nwe group similar activation patterns into a small set of representative\nclusters. Our method achieves up to 79.34% clustering precision, outperforming\nstandard binary clustering approaches while maintaining minimal degradation in\nperplexity (PPL) scores.

However, adopting AI models in risk-sensitive\ndomains often requires error rates near 0%. To address this gap, we propose\ncollaboration between a reasoning model and a human expert who resolves queries\nthe model cannot confidently answer. We find that quantifying the uncertainty\nof a reasoning model through the length of its reasoning trace yields an\neffective basis for deferral to a human, e.g., cutting the error rate of Qwen3\n235B-A22B on difficult MATH problems from 3% to less than 1% when deferring\n7.5% of queries. However, the high latency of reasoning models still makes them\nchallenging to deploy on use cases with high query volume. To address this\nchallenge, we explore fronting a reasoning model with a large non-reasoning\nmodel. We call this modified human-in-the-loop system \"Fail Fast, or Ask\",\nsince the non-reasoning model may defer difficult queries to the human expert\ndirectly (\"failing fast\"), without incurring the reasoning model's higher\nlatency. We show that this approach yields around 40% latency reduction and\nabout 50% cost savings for DeepSeek R1 while maintaining 90+% area under the\naccuracy-rejection curve. However, we observe that latency savings are lower\nthan expected because of \"latency drag\", the phenomenon that processing easier\nqueries with a non-reasoning model pushes the reasoning model's latency\ndistribution towards longer latencies.

The\nmotivation for this analysis stems from the equation's importance in modeling\nwave propagation and transport phenomena, where accurate resolution of\ndispersive effects is critical, and traditional numerical schemes often suffer\nfrom spurious artifacts. We analyze one sixth order and two eighth order\ncompact spatial discretization schemes, encompassing both node centered and\ncell centered formulations, combined with a third order strong stability\npreserving Runge Kutta (SSPRK3) time integrator. The analysis is performed in\nterms of key nondimensional parameters such as the wavenumber, Courant\nFriedrichs Lewy number $N_c$, and dispersion number $D_{\\alpha}$ over the full\nspectral plane for both one and two dimensional cases. Key numerical\nindicators, including the amplification factor, normalized phase speed, and\nnormalized group velocity, are evaluated to characterize stability, dispersion\nerror, errors in energy transport, and directional anisotropy.

Efficient beam alignment is essential for initial access, but\ndeep learning (DL) solutions face challenges, including high data collection\noverhead, hardware constraints, lack of explainability, and susceptibility to\nadversarial attacks. This paper proposes a robust and explainable DL-based beam\nalignment engine (BAE) for mmWave multiple-input multiple output (MIMO)\nsystems. The BAE uses received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements\nfrom wide beams to predict the best narrow beam, reducing the overhead of\nexhaustive beam sweeping. To overcome the challenge of real-world data\ncollection, this work leverages a site-specific digital twin (DT) to generate\nsynthetic channel data closely resembling real-world environments. A model\nrefinement via transfer learning is proposed to fine-tune the pre-trained model\nresiding in the DT with minimal real-world data, effectively bridging\nmismatches between the digital replica and real-world environments. To reduce\nbeam training overhead and enhance transparency, the framework uses deep\nShapley additive explanations (SHAP) to rank input features by importance,\nprioritizing key spatial directions and minimizing beam sweeping. It also\nincorporates the Deep k-nearest neighbors (DkNN) algorithm, providing a\ncredibility metric for detecting out-of-distribution inputs and ensuring\nrobust, transparent decision-making. Experimental results show that the\nproposed framework reduces real-world data needs by 70%, beam training overhead\nby 62%, and improves outlier detection robustness by up to 8.5x, achieving\nnear-optimal spectral efficiency and transparent decision making compared to\ntraditional softmax based DL models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u5bf9\u9f50\u5f15\u64ce\uff08BAE\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SHAP\u548cDkNN\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u57286G\u613f\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5bf9\u5efa\u7acb\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u786e\u4fdd\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u53ca\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u91c7\u7528SHAP\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408DkNN\u7b97\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f02\u5e38\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u51cf\u5c1170%\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u300162%\u6ce2\u675f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u53478.5\u500d\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u5f00\u9500\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

The\nAMD-IDDES approach incorporates an anisotropic minimum-dissipation (AMD) model\ninto the traditional IDDES framework to better account for local flow\nanisotropy and energy dissipation characteristics. The method is validated\nagainst the traditional IDDES approach, and the results show that AMD-IDDES\nmore accurately captures the evolution of vortices and separated shear layers.\nCompared with an iced straight wing, a swept wing exhibits distinct aerodynamic\nbehavior driven mainly by the sweep angle. The sweep angle induces strong\nspanwise flow, which reshapes the separation region and transforms the flow\nfrom two-dimensional to three-dimensional. This spanwise motion significantly\nalters vortex development and enhances the complexity of the unsteady flow.

The heterogeneity in these data\nand the diverse insight of investors introduce biases that complicate the\nmodeling of market dynamics. Unlike prior work, this paper explores the\npotential of bull and bear regimes in investor-driven market dynamics. Through\nempirical analysis on real-world financial datasets, we uncover a dynamic\nrelationship between bias variation and behavioral adaptation, which enhances\ntrend prediction under evolving market conditions. To model this mechanism, we\npropose the Bias to Behavior from Bull-Bear Dynamics model (B4), a unified\nframework that jointly embeds temporal price sequences and external contextual\nsignals into a shared latent space where opposing bull and bear forces\nnaturally emerge, forming the foundation for bias representation.

In DFQ, the quantization model must be\ncalibrated using synthetic samples, making the quality of these synthetic\nsamples crucial. Existing methods fail to fully capture and balance the global\nand local features within the samples, resulting in limited synthetic data\nquality. Moreover, we have found that during inference, there is a significant\ndifference in the distributions of intermediate layer activations between the\nquantized and full-precision models. These issues lead to a severe performance\ndegradation of the quantized model. To address these problems, we propose a\npipeline for Data-Free Quantization for Vision Transformers (DFQ-ViT).\nSpecifically, we synthesize samples in order of increasing difficulty,\neffectively enhancing the quality of synthetic data. During the calibration and\ninference stage, we introduce the activation correction matrix for the\nquantized model to align the intermediate layer activations with those of the\nfull-precision model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DFQ-ViT achieves\nremarkable superiority over existing DFQ methods and its performance is on par\nwith models quantized through real data.

As sequence lengths increase, the number of Key-Value (KV) pairs in\nLLMs escalates, creating a significant efficiency bottleneck. In this paper, we\npropose a new KV cache optimization paradigm called LaCache, a training-free\nmethod for efficient and accurate generative inference of LLMs. LaCache enables\nLLMs to simultaneously address both of the critical challenges in long-range\nmodeling: robust long-range capabilities and continuous generation without\nrunning out-of-memory (OOM). Specifically, LaCache integrates two key\ninnovations: (1) a ladder-shaped KV cache pattern that stores KV pairs not only\nsequentially (left-to-right within each layer) but also across layers (from\nshallow to deep), providing an extended span for capturing long-range\ndependencies under a fixed storage budget, thereby boosting long-range\ncapabilities; and (2) an iterative compaction mechanism that progressively\ncompresses older caches, freeing up space for new tokens within a fixed cache\nsize. This token distance-based dynamic compression enables more effective\ncontinuous generation under constrained cache budgets. Experiments across\nvarious tasks, benchmarks, and LLM models consistently validate LaCache's\neffectiveness in enhancing LLMs' long-range capabilities.

However, identifying optimal locations for hydrogen\nproduction requires the integration of complex environmental, atmospheric, and\ninfrastructural factors, often compounded by limited availability of direct\nhydrogen yield data. This study presents a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nframework for computing green hydrogen yield and site suitability index using\nmean absolute SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values. This framework\nconsists of a multi-stage pipeline of unsupervised multi-variable clustering,\nsupervised machine learning classifier and SHAP algorithm.

The\n  theory addresses both the stability of the method and provides error\n  estimates for two different approximation methods. A Kansa-like\n  matrix is obtained by replacing the test point set $X$, used in the\n  traditional Kansa method, by a larger set $Y$, which is a norming\n  set for the underlying trial space. This gives rise to a rectangular\n  matrix. In addition, if a basis of Lagrange (or local Lagrange)\n  functions is used for the trial space, then it is shown\n  that the stability of the matrix is comparable to the stability of\n  the elliptic operator acting on the trial space.

Traditionally, developers estimate story points\ncollaboratively using planning poker or other manual techniques. While the\ninitial calibrating of the estimates to each project is helpful, once a team\nhas converged on a set of precedents, story point estimation can become tedious\nand labor-intensive. Machine learning can reduce this burden, but only with\nenough context from the historical decisions made by the project team.

The\ngoal of this work is to streamline story point estimation by evaluating a\ncomparative learning-based framework for calibrating project-specific story\npoint prediction models. Instead of assigning a specific story point value to\nevery backlog item, developers are presented with pairs of items, and indicate\nwhich item requires more effort.

A\nparticular focus is on the approximation known as Stokes drift, and how it\nrelates to the particle kinematics as computed directly from the particle\ntrajectory mapping. The reduced Hamiltonian formulation of Zakharov and\nKrasitskii serves as a convenient tool to separate the effects of weak\nnonlinearity, in particular the appearance of bound harmonics and the mutual\ncorrections to the wave frequencies. By numerical integration of the particle\ntrajectory mappings we are able to compute motions and resulting drift for\nsea-states with one, two and several harmonics.

Recent studies have explored the use of Bidirectional Encoder\nRepresentations from Transformers (BERT) models on transcription data to\nreliably detect meaningful CPS indicators. A notable advancement involved the\nmultimodal BERT variant, AudiBERT, which integrates speech and\nacoustic-prosodic audio features to enhance CPS diagnosis. Although initial\nresults demonstrated multimodal improvements, the statistical significance of\nthese enhancements remained unclear, and there was insufficient guidance on\nleveraging human-AI complementarity for CPS diagnosis tasks. This workshop\npaper extends the previous research by highlighting that the AudiBERT model not\nonly improved the classification of classes that were sparse in the dataset,\nbut it also had statistically significant class-wise improvements over the BERT\nmodel for classifications in the social-cognitive dimension. However, similar\nsignificant class-wise improvements over the BERT model were not observed for\nclassifications in the affective dimension. A correlation analysis highlighted\nthat larger training data was significantly associated with higher recall\nperformance for both the AudiBERT and BERT models.

Existing\nReinforcement Learning (RL) methods train large reasoning models on a\nsingle-turn paradigm with verifiable rewards. However, we observe that models\ntrained with existing RL paradigms often lose their ability to solve problems\nacross multiple turns and struggle to revise answers based on contextual\nfeedback, leading to repetitive responses. We ask: can LRMs learn to reflect\ntheir answers in a multi-turn context? In this work, we find that training\nmodels with multi-turn RL using only unary feedback (e.g., \"Let's try again\")\nafter wrong answers can improve both single-turn performance and multi-turn\nreasoning. We introduce Unary Feedback as Observation (UFO) for reinforcement\nlearning, which uses minimal yet common unary user feedback during iterative\nproblem solving. It can be easily applied to existing single-turn RL training\nsetups. Experimental results show that RL training with UFO keeps single-turn\nperformance and improves multi-turn reasoning accuracy by up to 14%, enabling\nlanguage models to better react to feedback in multi-turn problem solving. To\nfurther minimize the number of turns needed for a correct answer while\nencouraging diverse reasoning when mistakes occur, we design reward structures\nthat guide models to produce careful and deliberate answers in each turn.

Critically, we analyze the paradoxical\nscenario where a non-robust baseline achieves high but compromised accuracy,\nand demonstrate that our agent learns a conservative policy to prioritize model\nintegrity. Furthermore, we prove the agent's policy is controllable via a\nsingle \"risk tolerance\" parameter, allowing practitioners to explicitly manage\nthe trade-off between performance and security.

While ANNs have demonstrated remarkable accuracy in\nfacial expression recognition, their ability to model inter-individual\ndifferences in human perception remains underexplored. This study investigates\nthe phenomenon of high perceptual variability-where individuals exhibit\nsignificant differences in emotion categorization even when viewing the same\nstimulus. Inspired by the similarity between ANNs and human perception, we\nhypothesize that facial expression samples that are ambiguous for ANN\nclassifiers also elicit divergent perceptual judgments among human observers.\nTo examine this hypothesis, we introduce a novel perceptual boundary sampling\nmethod to generate facial expression stimuli that lie along ANN decision\nboundaries. These ambiguous samples form the basis of the varEmotion dataset,\nconstructed through large-scale human behavioral experiments.

To address\nthese shortcomings, this paper proposes InsightX Agent, a novel LMM-based\nagentic framework designed to deliver reliable, interpretable, and interactive\nX-ray NDT analysis. Unlike typical sequential pipelines, InsightX Agent\npositions a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) as a central orchestrator,\ncoordinating between the Sparse Deformable Multi-Scale Detector (SDMSD) and the\nEvidence-Grounded Reflection (EGR) tool. The SDMSD generates dense defect\nregion proposals for multi-scale feature maps and sparsifies them through\nNon-Maximum Suppression (NMS), optimizing detection of small, dense targets in\nX-ray images while maintaining computational efficiency.

Accurate zero-shot prediction is allowed for\nPDEs that resemble the pretraining ones. When adapted to new unseen PDEs,\nPDEformer-2 demonstrates faster learning than many specialized models, and has\nsmaller errors given limited (less than 100) samples.

This surge\npresents a significant challenge in efficiently choosing the most suitable\npre-trained models for downstream tasks. The critical aspect of this challenge\nlies in effectively predicting the model transferability by considering the\nunderlying fine-tuning dynamics. Existing methods often model fine-tuning\ndynamics in feature space with linear transformations, which do not precisely\nalign with the fine-tuning objective and fail to grasp the essential\nnonlinearity from optimization. To this end, we present LEAD, a\nfinetuning-aligned approach based on the network output of logits. LEAD\nproposes a theoretical framework to model the optimization process and derives\nan ordinary differential equation (ODE) to depict the nonlinear evolution\ntoward the final logit state. Additionally, we design a class-aware\ndecomposition method to consider the varying evolution dynamics across classes\nand further ensure practical applicability. Integrating the closely aligned\noptimization objective and nonlinear modeling capabilities derived from the\ndifferential equation, our method offers a concise solution to effectively\nbridge the optimization gap in a single step, bypassing the lengthy fine-tuning\nprocess.

To address these limitations, recent\nresearch has explored modeling causal relationships among system components.\nHowever, prior work mainly focuses on offline causal graph-based approaches\nthat require static historical data and fail to generalize to real-time\nsettings.

INCADET dynamically captures evolving system behavior by\nincrementally updating causal graphs across streaming time windows. The\nframework comprises three modules: 1) Early Symptom Detection: Detects\ntransitions in system status using divergence in edge-weight distributions\nacross sequential causal graphs. 2) Incremental Causal Graph Learning:\nLeverages experience replay and edge reinforcement to continually refine causal\nstructures while preserving prior knowledge. 3) Causal Graph Classification:\nEmploys Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to classify system status using the\nlearned causal graphs. Extensive experiments on real-world critical\ninfrastructure datasets demonstrate that INCADET achieves superior accuracy,\nrobustness, and adaptability compared to both static causal and deep temporal\nbaselines in evolving attack scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "INCADET\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5b9e\u65f6\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u6765\u9002\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u65f6\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb\u5a01\u80c1\u65e5\u76ca\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u9759\u6001\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u5b9e\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "INCADET\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u65e9\u671f\u75c7\u72b6\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u589e\u91cf\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u548c\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cINCADET\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u56e0\u679c\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u65f6\u5e8f\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "INCADET\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u7559\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

An Analysis of Simple Test-Time Scaling", "comment": null, "summary": "Prior work proposed simple test-time scaling, a method for replicating this\nscaling behavior with models distilled from o1-like models by manually\ncontrolling test-time compute: either scaling down by enforcing a maximum\nlength or scaling up by iteratively appending \"Wait\" when the model is about to\nterminate its generation. This paper presents an analysis of simple test-time\nscaling and finds that the scaling behavior is largely attributed to scaling\ndown by enforcing a maximum length. In contrast, fine-tuning on long CoT data\ndistilled from o1-like models has no significant impact on scaling behavior,\nand scaling up by appending \"Wait\" leads to inconsistencies, as the model may\noscillate between solutions. A key distinction exists between scaling down by\nenforcing a maximum length and scaling up test-time compute in o1-like models,\nsuch as DeepSeek-R1\\@. These models are typically allowed to utilize as much\ncompute as needed, with the only constraint being the model's maximum supported\nlength. By learning to naturally scale up test-time compute during\nreinforcement learning, o1-like models surpass their peak performance when\nscaling up. In contrast, simple test-time scaling progressively imposes a lower\nupper limit on model performance as it scales down. While replicating the\ntest-time scaling behavior of o1 models can be straightforward by scaling down,\nit is crucial to recognize that the goal of scaling test-time compute is to\nunlock higher performance -- beyond what the model could originally achieve --\nrather than merely reproducing the appearance of scaling behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u9650\u5236\u6700\u5927\u957f\u5ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u800c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ffd\u52a0\u201cWait\u201d\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002o1\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u7136\u6269\u5c55\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u7b80\u5355\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u4e0eo1\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u6269\u5c55\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u7b80\u5355\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u9650\u5236\u6700\u5927\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u8ffd\u52a0\u201cWait\u201d\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eo1\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u6269\u5c55\u884c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u9650\u5236\u6700\u5927\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u8ffd\u52a0\u201cWait\u201d\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1bo1\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u7136\u6269\u5c55\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b80\u5355\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u80fd\u6a21\u62df\u7f29\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u800co1\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u6269\u5c55\u80fd\u529b\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Among these domains, mathematical reasoning serves as a representative\nbenchmark as it requires precise multi-step logic and abstract reasoning, which\ncan be generalized to other tasks.

Although many open-source projects aim to\nclose this gap, most of them lack sufficient openness by omitting critical\nresources such as datasets and detailed training configurations, which hinders\nreproducibility.

To\nenhance the robustness and efficiency of the RLVR process, we introduce\nContext-Aware Multi-Stage Policy Optimization, an algorithm that integrates\nlength-progressive training with an adaptive repetition penalty to encourage\ncontext-aware RL training.

In this paper, we propose\nExp-Graph, a novel framework designed to represent the structural relationships\namong facial attributes using graph-based modeling for facial expression\nrecognition. For facial attributes graph representation, facial landmarks are\nused as the graph's vertices. At the same time, the edges are determined based\non the proximity of the facial landmark and the similarity of the local\nappearance of the facial attributes encoded using the vision transformer.\nAdditionally, graph convolutional networks are utilized to capture and\nintegrate these structural dependencies into the encoding of facial attributes,\nthereby enhancing the accuracy of expression recognition. Thus, Exp-Graph\nlearns from the facial attribute graphs highly expressive semantic\nrepresentations. On the other hand, the vision transformer and graph\nconvolutional blocks help the framework exploit the local and global\ndependencies among the facial attributes that are essential for the recognition\nof facial expressions.

Although GNNs inherently encode\nspecific inductive biases (e.g., acting as low-pass or high-pass filters), most\nexisting methods implicitly assume conditional independence among node labels\nin their optimization objectives. While this assumption is suitable for\ntraditional classification tasks such as image recognition, it contradicts the\nintuitive observation that node labels in graphs remain correlated, even after\nconditioning on the graph structure. To make structured predictions for node\nlabels, we propose ReDiSC, namely, Reparameterized masked Diffusion model for\nStructured node Classification. ReDiSC estimates the joint distribution of node\nlabels using a reparameterized masked diffusion model, which is learned through\nthe variational expectation-maximization (EM) framework. Our theoretical\nanalysis shows the efficiency advantage of ReDiSC in the E-step compared to\nDPM-SNC, a state-of-the-art model that relies on a manifold-constrained\ndiffusion model in continuous domain. Meanwhile, we explicitly link ReDiSC's\nM-step objective to popular GNN and label propagation hybrid approaches.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that ReDiSC achieves superior or highly\ncompetitive performance compared to state-of-the-art GNN, label propagation,\nand diffusion-based baselines across both homophilic and heterophilic graphs of\nvarying sizes.

The lack of datasets in other\nlanguages further limits the global realization of suicide prevention via\nartificial intelligence (AI). In this study, we address one of these gaps by\nconstructing a novel Turkish suicidal ideation corpus derived from social media\nposts and introducing a resource-efficient annotation framework involving three\nhuman annotators and two large language models (LLMs). We then address the\nremaining gaps by performing a bidirectional evaluation of label reliability\nand model consistency across this dataset and three popular English suicidal\nideation detection datasets, using transfer learning through eight pre-trained\nsentiment and emotion classifiers. These transformers help assess annotation\nconsistency and benchmark model performance against manually labeled data. Our\nfindings underscore the need for more rigorous, language-inclusive approaches\nto annotation and evaluation in mental health natural language processing (NLP)\nwhile demonstrating the questionable performance of popular models with\nzero-shot transfer learning. We advocate for transparency in model training and\ndataset construction in mental health NLP, prioritizing data and model\nreliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u571f\u8033\u5176\u8bed\u81ea\u6740\u610f\u5ff5\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6807\u7b7e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u6740\u610f\u5ff5\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8bed\u8a00\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u571f\u8033\u5176\u8bed\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u547c\u5401\u5728\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7NLP\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002"}}

Addressing these\nissues, a novel Multispectral State-Space Feature Fusion framework, dubbed\nMS2Fusion, is proposed based on the state space model (SSM), achieving\nefficient and effective fusion through a dual-path parametric interaction\nmechanism. More specifically, the first cross-parameter interaction branch\ninherits the advantage of cross-attention in mining complementary information\nwith cross-modal hidden state decoding in SSM. The second shared-parameter\nbranch explores cross-modal alignment with joint embedding to obtain\ncross-modal similar semantic features and structures through parameter sharing\nin SSM. Finally, these two paths are jointly optimized with SSM for fusing\nmultispectral features in a unified framework, allowing our MS2Fusion to enjoy\nboth functional complementarity and shared semantic space. In our extensive\nexperiments on mainstream benchmarks including FLIR, M3FD and LLVIP, our\nMS2Fusion significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art multispectral object\ndetection methods, evidencing its superiority.

Our findings demonstrate\nthat networks trained on automatically transcribed data from each child can\nacquire and generalize word-referent mappings across multiple network\narchitectures.

When\ntreatment assignment is random, the average treatment effect (ATE) can be\nestimated directly by comparing outcomes between groups. In non-randomized\nsettings, various techniques are employed to adjust for confounding and\napproximate the counterfactual scenario to recover an unbiased ATE. A common\nchallenge, especially in observational studies, is the absence of units clearly\nlabeled as controls-that is, units known not to have received the treatment. To\naddress this, we propose positive-unlabeled (PU) learning as a framework for\nidentifying, with high confidence, control units from a pool of unlabeled ones,\nusing only the available treated (positive) units. We evaluate this approach\nusing both simulated and real-world data. We construct a causal graph with\ndiverse relationships and use it to generate synthetic data under various\nscenarios, assessing how reliably the method recovers control groups that allow\nestimates of true ATE. We also apply our approach to real-world data on optimal\nsowing and fertilizer treatments in sustainable agriculture.

The multi-scale\ninstance-level discrimination pathway aligns hierarchical histopathology\nrepresentations extracted at local, neighbor, and global levels with gene\nexpression profiles, capturing scale-aware morphological-transcriptional\nrelationships. In parallel, the cross-level instance-group discrimination\npathway enforces structural consistency between individual (image/gene)\ninstances and modality-crossed (gene/image, respectively) groups, strengthening\nthe alignment across modalities. By jointly modelling fine-grained and\nstructural-level discrimination, Gene-DML is able to learn robust cross-modal\nrepresentations, enhancing both predictive accuracy and generalization across\ndiverse biological contexts.

Companion code and\n  reproducibility materials available", "summary": "The self-attention mechanism, now central to deep learning architectures such\nas Transformers, is a modern instance of a more general computational\nprinciple: learning and using pairwise affinity matrices to control how\ninformation flows through a model. This paper traces the conceptual origins of\nself-attention across multiple domains, including computer vision, natural\nlanguage processing, and graph learning, through their shared reliance on an\naffinity matrix, denoted as A. We highlight Infinite Feature Selection (Inf-FS)\nas a foundational approach that generalizes the idea of affinity-based\nweighting. Unlike the fixed dot-product structure used in Transformers, Inf-FS\ndefines A either through domain knowledge or by learning, and computes feature\nrelevance through multi-hop propagation over the affinity graph.

The proposed\nscene-aware and instance-perception prompts are then introduced to align\nrationales with visual information from the MLLM teacher via the\nNegative-Guided Multimodal Prompting Alignment (NMPA) module, effectively\ncapturing holistic and perceptual multimodal knowledge. Finally, the aligned\nmultimodal knowledge is distilled into the student Ov-GSR model, providing a\nstronger foundation for generalization that enhances situation understanding,\nbridges the gap between seen and unseen scenarios, and mitigates prediction\nbias in rare cases.

Batching allows managers to trade off cost and\nprocessing effort against waiting time. Larger and less frequent batches may\nlower costs by reducing processing effort and amortizing fixed costs, but they\ncreate longer waiting times. In contrast, smaller and more frequent batches\nreduce waiting times but increase fixed costs and processing effort. A batching\npolicy defines how activity instances are grouped into batches and when each\nbatch is activated. This paper addresses the problem of discovering batching\npolicies that strike optimal trade-offs between waiting time, processing\neffort, and cost. The paper proposes a Pareto optimization approach that starts\nfrom a given set (possibly empty) of activity batching policies and generates\nalternative policies for each batched activity via intervention heuristics.\nEach heuristic identifies an opportunity to improve an activity's batching\npolicy with respect to a metric (waiting time, processing time, cost, or\nresource utilization) and an associated adjustment to the activity's batching\npolicy (the intervention). The impact of each intervention is evaluated via\nsimulation. The intervention heuristics are embedded in an optimization\nmeta-heuristic that triggers interventions to iteratively update the Pareto\nfront of the interventions identified so far. The paper considers three\nmeta-heuristics: hill-climbing, simulated annealing, and reinforcement\nlearning.

The emergence of large language\nmodel (LLM) is providing a new path to achieve this goal.

Furthermore,\nthese methods typically require detailed user input to drive the drama. These\nlimitations reduce the interactivity and immersion of online real-time\nperformance. To address the above challenges, we propose HAMLET, a multi-agent\nframework focused on drama creation and online performance. Given a simple\ntopic, the framework generates a narrative blueprint, guiding the subsequent\nimprovisational performance. During the online performance, each actor is given\nan autonomous mind. This means that actors can make independent decisions based\non their own background, goals, and emotional state. In addition to\nconversations with other actors, their decisions can also change the state of\nscene props through actions such as opening a letter or picking up a weapon.\nThe change is then broadcast to other related actors, updating what they know\nand care about, which in turn influences their next action. To evaluate the\nquality of drama performance, we designed an evaluation method to assess three\nprimary aspects, including character performance, narrative quality, and\ninteraction experience.

Recently developed foundational models\nfor 3D reconstruction, such as Dense and Unconstrained Stereo 3D Reconstruction\n(DUSt3R), Matching and Stereo 3D Reconstruction (MASt3R), and Visual Geometry\nGrounded Transformer (VGGT), have attracted attention due to their ability to\nhandle very sparse image overlaps.

For redundant collections, they can\naccelerate 3D reconstruction by using extremely sparsified image sets. Despite\ntests on various computer vision benchmarks, their potential on photogrammetric\naerial blocks remains unexplored.

Specifically, trainable activation functions defined as ratios of\npolynomials (rational functions) have been proposed to enhance plasticity in\nreinforcement learning. However, their impact on training stability remains\nunclear. In this work, we study trainable rational activations in both\nreinforcement and continual learning settings. We find that while their\nflexibility enhances adaptability, it can also introduce instability, leading\nto overestimation in RL and feature collapse in longer continual learning\nscenarios. Our main result is demonstrating a trade-off between expressivity\nand plasticity in rational activations. To address this, we propose a\nconstrained variant that structurally limits excessive output scaling while\npreserving adaptability. Experiments across MetaWorld and DeepMind Control\nSuite (DMC) environments show that our approach improves training stability and\nperformance. In continual learning benchmarks, including MNIST with reshuffled\nlabels and Split CIFAR-100, we reveal how different constraints affect the\nbalance between expressivity and long-term retention.

In a randomized, blinded virtual Objective Structured Clinical\nExamination (OSCE) of text consultations with asynchronous oversight, we\ncompared g-AMIE to NPs/PAs or a group of PCPs under the same guardrails. Across\n60 scenarios, g-AMIE outperformed both groups in performing high-quality\nintake, summarizing cases, and proposing diagnoses and management plans for the\noverseeing PCP to review.

This issue motivates us to develop a\nflexible domain adaptation method to enhance dehazing performance during\ntesting. Observing that predicting haze patterns is generally easier than\nrecovering clean content, we propose the Physics-guided Haze Transfer Network\n(PHATNet) which transfers haze patterns from unseen target domains to\nsource-domain haze-free images, creating domain-specific fine-tuning sets to\nupdate dehazing models for effective domain adaptation. Additionally, we\nintroduce a Haze-Transfer-Consistency loss and a Content-Leakage Loss to\nenhance PHATNet's disentanglement ability.

However, the\nhigh-density breast tissue often leads to high concealment of the mass lesions,\nwhich makes manual annotation difficult and time-consuming. As a result, there\nis a lack of annotated data for model training. Diffusion models are commonly\nused for data augmentation, but the existing methods face two challenges.\nFirst, due to the high concealment of lesions, it is difficult for the model to\nlearn the features of the lesion area. This leads to the low generation quality\nof the lesion areas, thus limiting the quality of the generated images. Second,\nexisting methods can only generate images and cannot generate corresponding\nannotations, which restricts the usability of the generated images in\nsupervised training.

The\nresults show performance gains across different model scales, validating the\ndataset's effectiveness and applicability.", "AI": {"tldr": "ChiMed 2.0\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4e2d\u6587\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4f20\u7edf\u4e2d\u533b\u548c\u73b0\u4ee3\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548cRLHF\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e2d\u6587\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u5c0f\u3001\u9886\u57df\u8986\u76d6\u7a84\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548cRLHF\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faChiMed 2.0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548cRLHF\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u901a\u7528LLM\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ChiMed 2.0\u4e3a\u4e2d\u6587\u533b\u5b66LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

Chest X-rays (CXRs) are a\nvital diagnostic tool, providing insights into clinical trajectories, but their\nirregular acquisition limits their utility. Existing tools for CXR\ninterpretation are constrained by cross-sectional analysis, failing to capture\ntemporal dynamics. To address this, we introduce CXR-TFT, a novel multi-modal\nframework that integrates temporally sparse CXR imaging and radiology reports\nwith high-frequency clinical data, such as vital signs, laboratory values, and\nrespiratory flow sheets, to predict the trajectory of CXR findings in\ncritically ill patients. CXR-TFT leverages latent embeddings from a vision\nencoder that are temporally aligned with hourly clinical data through\ninterpolation. A transformer model is then trained to predict CXR embeddings at\neach hour, conditioned on previous embeddings and clinical measurements. In a\nretrospective study of 20,000 ICU patients, CXR-TFT demonstrated high accuracy\nin forecasting abnormal CXR findings up to 12 hours before they became\nradiographically evident. This predictive capability in clinical data holds\nsignificant potential for enhancing the management of time-sensitive conditions\nlike acute respiratory distress syndrome, where early intervention is crucial\nand diagnoses are often delayed.

The intricate interactions among\nintelligent agents make abnormal emergence analysis challenging, as traditional\ncausal methods focus on individual trajectories.

The experiments\nvalidate EAMI in complex online-to-offline (O2O) service system and the\nStanford AI Town experiment, with ablation studies confirming its\neffectiveness, generalizability, and efficiency.

Memorization measures differ in outcomes and\ninformation requirements.\n  Experimenting on 18 LLMs from 6 families and multiple formal languages of\ndifferent entropy, we show that (a) memorization measures disagree on\nmemorization order of varying frequent strings, (b) optimal learning of a\nlanguage cannot avoid partial memorization of training strings, and (c)\nimproved learning decreases contextual and counterfactual memorization but\nincreases recollection-based memorization.

This study investigates this phenomenon by focusing on\ntemporal cognition in LLMs. Leveraging the similarity judgment task, we find\nthat larger models spontaneously establish a subjective temporal reference\npoint and adhere to the Weber-Fechner law, whereby the perceived distance\nlogarithmically compresses as years recede from this reference point. To\nuncover the mechanisms behind this behavior, we conducted multiple analyses\nacross neuronal, representational, and informational levels. We first identify\na set of temporal-preferential neurons and find that this group exhibits\nminimal activation at the subjective reference point and implements a\nlogarithmic coding scheme convergently found in biological systems. Probing\nrepresentations of years reveals a hierarchical construction process, where\nyears evolve from basic numerical values in shallow layers to abstract temporal\norientation in deep layers. Finally, using pre-trained embedding models, we\nfound that the training corpus itself possesses an inherent, non-linear\ntemporal structure, which provides the raw material for the model's internal\nconstruction. In discussion, we propose an experientialist perspective for\nunderstanding these findings, where the LLMs' cognition is viewed as a\nsubjective construction of the external world by its internal representational\nsystem. This nuanced perspective implies the potential emergence of alien\ncognitive frameworks that humans cannot intuitively predict, pointing toward a\ndirection for AI alignment that focuses on guiding internal constructions.

Existing 3D visual grounding methods typically rely on\nseparate encoders for different modalities (e.g., RGB images, text, and 3D\npoint clouds), resulting in large and complex models that are inefficient to\ntrain. While some approaches use pre-trained 2D multi-modal models like CLIP\nfor 3D tasks, they still struggle with aligning point cloud data to 2D\nencoders. As a result, these methods continue to depend on 3D encoders for\nfeature extraction, further increasing model complexity and training\ninefficiency. In this paper, we propose a unified 2D pre-trained multi-modal\nnetwork to process all three modalities (RGB images, text, and point clouds),\nsignificantly simplifying the architecture. By leveraging a 2D CLIP bi-modal\nmodel with adapter-based fine-tuning, this framework effectively adapts to the\ntri-modal setting, improving both adaptability and performance across\nmodalities. Our Geometric-Aware 2D-3D Feature Recovery and Fusion (GARF) module\nis designed to fuse geometric multi-scale features from point clouds and\nimages. We then integrate textual features for final modality fusion and\nintroduce a multi-modal decoder to facilitate deep cross-modal understanding.\nTogether, our method achieves unified feature extraction and fusion across the\nthree modalities, enabling an end-to-end 3D visual grounding model.

Project page: https://d223302.github.io/STITCH/", "summary": "Spoken Language Models (SLMs) are designed to take speech inputs and produce\nspoken responses. However, current SLMs lack the ability to perform an\ninternal, unspoken thinking process before responding. In contrast, humans\ntypically engage in complex mental reasoning internally, enabling them to\ncommunicate ideas clearly and concisely. Thus, integrating an unspoken thought\nprocess into SLMs is highly desirable. While naively generating a complete\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before starting to talk can enable thinking\nfor SLMs, this induces additional latency for the speech response, as the CoT\nreasoning can be arbitrarily long. To solve this issue, we propose Stitch, a\nnovel generation method that alternates between the generation of unspoken\nreasoning chunks and spoken response chunks. Since the audio duration of a\nchunk of spoken response is much longer than the time to generate the tokens in\na chunk of spoken response, we use the remaining free time to generate the\nunspoken reasoning tokens.

However, it\nremains unclear whether RLVR truly expands a model's reasoning boundary or\nmerely amplifies high-reward outputs that the base model already knows for\nimproved precision. This study presents a theoretical and empirical\ninvestigation that provides fresh insights into the potential limits of RLVR.\nFirst, we offer a new theoretical perspective that RLVR is constrained by the\nbase model's support-unable to sample solutions with zero initial\nprobability-and operates as a conservative reweighting mechanism that may\nrestrict the discovery of entirely original solutions. We also identify an\nentropy-reward tradeoff: while RLVR reliably enhances precision, it may\nprogressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet\nunderrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while\nRLVR consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally\noutweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets,\nfailing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base\nmodel. Interestingly, we also observe that while RLVR sometimes increases\ntoken-level entropy, resulting in greater uncertainty at each generation step,\nanswer-level entropy declines, indicating that these seemingly more uncertain\npaths ultimately converge onto a smaller set of distinct answers.

We present an approach for pose estimation in cryo-EM that\nleverages multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) techniques in a robust manner to\nestimate the 3D rotation matrix of each particle from pairs of dihedral angles.\nWe express the rotation matrix in the form of an axis of rotation and a unit\nvector in the plane perpendicular to the axis.

To address this challenge, we introduce two complementary\ncomponents: (i) a robust joint optimization framework for pose estimation based\non an $\\ell_1$-norm objective or a similar robust norm, which simultaneously\nestimates rotation axes and in-plane vectors while exactly enforcing unit norm\nand orthogonality constraints via projected coordinate descent; and (ii) an\niterative shift correction algorithm that estimates consistent in-plane\ntranslations through a global least-squares formulation.

Several deep learning-based models have been developed to\nidentify such users. These models should not only accurately detect bad actors,\nbut also be robust against adversarial attacks that aim to evade detection.\nHowever, past deep learning-based detection models do not meet the robustness\nrequirement because they are sensitive to even minor changes in the input\nsequence. To address this issue, we focus on (1) improving the model\nunderstanding capability and (2) enhancing the model knowledge such that the\nmodel can recognize potential input modifications when making predictions. To\nachieve these goals, we create a novel transformer-based classification model,\ncalled ROBAD (RObust adversary-aware local-global attended Bad Actor Detection\nmodel), which uses the sequence of user posts to generate user embedding to\ndetect bad actors. Particularly, ROBAD first leverages the transformer encoder\nblock to encode each post bidirectionally, thus building a post embedding to\ncapture the local information at the post level. Next, it adopts the\ntransformer decoder block to model the sequential pattern in the post\nembeddings by using the attention mechanism, which generates the sequence\nembedding to obtain the global information at the sequence level. Finally, to\nenrich the knowledge of the model, embeddings of modified sequences by mimicked\nattackers are fed into a contrastive-learning-enhanced classification layer for\nsequence prediction. In essence, by capturing the local and global information\n(i.e., the post and sequence information) and leveraging the mimicked behaviors\nof bad actors in training, ROBAD can be robust to adversarial attacks.\nExtensive experiments on Yelp and Wikipedia datasets show that ROBAD can\neffectively detect bad actors when under state-of-the-art adversarial attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aROBAD\u7684Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u826f\u884c\u4e3a\u8005\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u4fe1\u606f\u6355\u6349\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0d\u826f\u884c\u4e3a\u8005\u65f6\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u5fae\u5c0f\u53d8\u5316\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "ROBAD\u7ed3\u5408Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u6355\u6349\u5e16\u5b50\u7ea7\u5c40\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u5168\u5c40\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u5206\u7c7b\u5c42\u3002", "result": "\u5728Yelp\u548cWikipedia\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cROBAD\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u62b5\u5fa1\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "conclusion": "ROBAD\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u4fe1\u606f\u6355\u6349\u53ca\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In particular,\nresearchers are increasingly fascinated by harnessing the power of generative\nAI to automate the discovery of novel analog circuit topologies. Unlocking the\nfull potential of generative AI in these data-driven discoveries requires\naccess to large and diverse datasets.Yet, there is a significant barrier in the\nanalog domain--Analog circuit design is inherently proprietary, involving not\nonly confidential circuit structures but also the underlying commercial\nsemiconductor processes. As a result, current generative AI research is largely\nconfined to individual researchers who construct small, narrowly focused\nprivate datasets. This fragmentation severely limits collaborative innovation\nand impedes progress across the research community. To address these\nchallenges, we propose AnalogFed. AnalogFed enables collaborative topology\ndiscovery across decentralized clients (e.g., individual researchers or\ninstitutions) without requiring the sharing of raw private data. To make this\nvision practical, we introduce a suite of techniques tailored to the unique\nchallenges of applying FedL in analog design--from generative model development\nand data heterogeneity handling to privacy-preserving strategies that ensure\nboth flexibility and security for circuit designers and semiconductor\nmanufacturers. Extensive experiments across varying client counts and dataset\nsizes demonstrate that AnalogFed achieves performance comparable to centralized\nbaselines--while maintaining strict data privacy.

StableAnimator++ then computes image and face\nembeddings using off-the-shelf encoders, refining the face embeddings via a\nglobal content-aware Face Encoder. To further maintain ID, we introduce a\ndistribution-aware ID Adapter that counteracts interference caused by temporal\nlayers while preserving ID via distribution alignment. During the inference\nstage, we propose a novel Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) based face optimization\nintegrated into the denoising process, guiding the diffusion trajectory for\nenhanced facial fidelity.

In\nparticular, endoscopists have to repeatedly flush to clear blood, allowing only\nmilliseconds to identify bleeding sources, an inefficient process that prolongs\noperations and elevates patient risks. However, current Artificial Intelligence\n(AI) methods primarily focus on bleeding region segmentation, overlooking the\ncritical need for accurate bleeding source detection and temporal tracking in\nthe challenging ESD environment, which is marked by frequent visual\nobstructions and dynamic scene changes. This gap is widened by the lack of\nspecialized datasets, hindering the development of robust AI-assisted guidance\nsystems. To address these challenges, we introduce BleedOrigin-Bench, the first\ncomprehensive ESD bleeding source dataset, featuring 1,771 expert-annotated\nbleeding sources across 106,222 frames from 44 procedures, supplemented with\n39,755 pseudo-labeled frames.

To address this\nresearch gap, this paper makes three novel contributions. First, we conduct a\npilot study with 20 crowd-workers on Amazon MTurk to experimentally validate\nthe alignment of existing CF evaluation metrics with real-world user\npreferences.

GNNs have proven\nhighly effective in various network-based learning applications and require\nsome form of node features to function. However, their performance is heavily\ninfluenced by the expressiveness of these features. In social networks, node\nfeatures are often unavailable due to privacy constraints or the absence of\ninherent attributes, making it challenging for GNNs to achieve optimal\nperformance. To address this limitation, we propose two strategies for\nconstructing expressive node features. First, we introduce average\ncontrollability along with other centrality metrics (denoted as NCT-EFA) as\nnode-level metrics that capture critical aspects of network topology. Building\non this, we develop a rank encoding method that transforms average\ncontrollability or any other graph-theoretic metric into a fixed-dimensional\nfeature space, thereby improving feature representation.

Progress requires us to address\na number of translational issues, including sample efficiency, training time,\nand minimizing loop latency such that stimulation may be shaped in response to\nchanging brain activity. We propose temporal basis function models (TBFMs) to\naddress these difficulties, and explore this approach in the context of\nexcitatory optogenetic stimulation. We demonstrate the ability of TBF models to\nprovide a single-trial, spatiotemporal forward prediction of the effect of\noptogenetic stimulation on local field potentials (LFPs) measured in two\nnon-human primates. We further use simulations to demonstrate the use of TBF\nmodels for closed-loop stimulation, driving neural activity towards target\npatterns. The simplicity of TBF models allow them to be sample efficient, rapid\nto train (2-4min), and low latency (0.2ms) on desktop CPUs. We demonstrate the\nmodel on 40 sessions of previously published excitatory optogenetic stimulation\ndata.

The differential perspective-n-point (PnP) has been widely used to\nsupervise I2P registration networks by enforcing the projective constraints on\n2D-3D correspondences. However, differential PnP is highly sensitive to noise\nand outliers in the predicted correspondences. This issue hinders the\neffectiveness of correspondence learning. Inspired by the robustness of blind\nPnP against noise and outliers in correspondences, we propose an approximated\nblind PnP based correspondence learning approach. To mitigate the high\ncomputational cost of blind PnP, we simplify blind PnP to an amenable task of\nminimizing Chamfer distance between learned 2D and 3D keypoints, called\nMinCD-PnP. To effectively solve MinCD-PnP, we design a lightweight multi-task\nlearning module, named as MinCD-Net, which can be easily integrated into the\nexisting I2P registration architectures.

Our filtering solution augments PSID with a reduced-rank\nregression step that directly learns the optimal gain required for the update\nstep from data.

However, traditional evaluation methods, which\nfocus solely on final accuracy, fail to capture the full dynamics of the\nlearning process. To address this gap, we propose PALM (Performance Analysis of\nActive Learning Models), a unified and interpretable mathematical model that\ncharacterizes AL trajectories through four key parameters: achievable accuracy,\ncoverage efficiency, early-stage performance, and scalability. PALM provides a\npredictive description of AL behavior from partial observations, enabling the\nestimation of future performance and facilitating principled comparisons across\ndifferent strategies. We validate PALM through extensive experiments on\nCIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet-50/100/200, covering a wide range of AL methods and\nself-supervised embeddings. Our results demonstrate that PALM generalizes\neffectively across datasets, budgets, and strategies, accurately predicting\nfull learning curves from limited labeled data. Importantly, PALM reveals\ncrucial insights into learning efficiency, data space coverage, and the\nscalability of AL methods. By enabling the selection of cost-effective\nstrategies and predicting performance under tight budget constraints, PALM lays\nthe basis for more systematic, reproducible, and data-efficient evaluation of\nAL in both research and real-world applications.

To address these challenges,\nwe present FedMultiEmo, a privacy-preserving framework that fuses two\ncomplementary modalities at the decision level: visual features extracted by a\nConvolutional Neural Network from facial images, and physiological cues (heart\nrate, electrodermal activity, and skin temperature) classified by a Random\nForest. FedMultiEmo builds on three key elements: (1) a multimodal federated\nlearning pipeline with majority-vote fusion, (2) an end-to-end edge-to-cloud\nprototype on Raspberry Pi clients and a Flower server, and (3) a personalized\nFederated Averaging scheme that weights client updates by local data volume.\nEvaluated on FER2013 and a custom physiological dataset, the federated\nConvolutional Neural Network attains 77% accuracy, the Random Forest 74%, and\ntheir fusion 87%, matching a centralized baseline while keeping all raw data\nlocal. The developed system converges in 18 rounds, with an average round time\nof 120 seconds and a per-client memory footprint below 200 MB.

Sub-analyses assessed models with different feature sets\n(imaging-only, clinical/molecular-only, combined-features) and patient subsets\n(S-1: all patients, S-2: with molecular data, S-3: IDH wildtype).\n  Results: The best performance was observed in the full cohort (S-1). In\nexternal validation, the combined-feature CR model achieved an AUC of 0.75,\nslightly, but significantly outperforming clinical-only (0.74) and imaging-only\n(0.68) models. DL models showed similar trends, though without statistical\nsignificance. In S-2 and S-3, combined models did not outperform clinical-only\nmodels. Exploratory analysis of CR models for overall survival prediction\nsuggested greater relevance of imaging data: across all subsets,\ncombined-feature models significantly outperformed clinical-only models, though\nwith a modest advantage of 2-4 C-index points.\n  Conclusions: While confirming the predictive value of anatomical MRI\nsequences for glioblastoma prognosis, this multi-center study found standard CR\nand DL radiomics approaches offer minimal added value over demographic\npredictors such as age and gender.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u653e\u5c04\u7ec4\u5b66\uff08CR\uff09\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DL\uff09MRI\u653e\u5c04\u7ec4\u5b66\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u80f6\u8d28\u6bcd\u7ec6\u80de\u7624\u9884\u540e\uff08\u751f\u5b58\u671f\u22646\u4e2a\u6708 vs >6\u4e2a\u6708\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u9644\u52a0\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u653e\u5c04\u7ec4\u5b66\u5728\u80f6\u8d28\u6bcd\u7ec6\u80de\u7624\u9884\u540e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u591a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u662f\u5426\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u6765\u81ea\u4e94\u4e2a\u745e\u58eb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6765\u6e90\u76841152\u4f8b\u80f6\u8d28\u6bcd\u7ec6\u80de\u7624\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86CR\u548cDL\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u961f\u5217\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u7684CR\u6a21\u578bAUC\u4e3a0.75\uff0c\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4e34\u5e8a\uff080.74\uff09\u548c\u4ec5\u5f71\u50cf\uff080.68\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u3002DL\u6a21\u578b\u8d8b\u52bf\u76f8\u4f3c\u4f46\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86MRI\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u6807\u51c6CR\u548cDL\u653e\u5c04\u7ec4\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u540e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u9644\u52a0\u4ef7\u503c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4ec5\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u6027\u522b\u7b49\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

Existing methods address\nthis challenge by tapping Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to access knowledge\nbeyond the training data.

In this paper, we introduce HOLa (Zero-Shot HOI Detection with\nLow-Rank Decomposed VLM Feature Adaptation), a novel approach that both\nenhances generalization to unseen classes and improves action distinction.

Traditional approaches treat spatial and temporal information\nseparately. Due to issues like motion blur, it is challenging to accurately\nrepresent the spatial information of rapidly moving objects. This can lead to\ntemporally important regions being underemphasized during spatial feature\nextraction, which in turn hinders accurate spatio-temporal interaction and\nvideo understanding. To address this limitation, we propose an innovative video\nrepresentation method called Dynamic-Image (DynImg). Specifically, we introduce\na set of non-key frames as temporal prompts to highlight the spatial areas\ncontaining fast-moving objects. During the process of visual feature\nextraction, these prompts guide the model to pay additional attention to the\nfine-grained spatial features corresponding to these regions.

The deployment of FL algorithms is expected to\nempower a wide range of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, e.g., autonomous\ndriving, augmented reality, and healthcare. The mission-critical and\ntime-sensitive nature of these applications necessitates the design of\nlow-latency FL frameworks that guarantee high learning performance. In\npractice, achieving low-latency FL faces two challenges: the overhead of\ncomputing and transmitting high-dimensional model updates, and the\nheterogeneity in communication-and-computation (C$^2$) capabilities across\ndevices. To address these challenges, we propose a novel C$^2$-aware framework\nfor optimal batch-size control that minimizes end-to-end (E2E) learning latency\nwhile ensuring convergence. The framework is designed to balance a fundamental\nC$^2$ tradeoff as revealed through convergence analysis. Specifically,\nincreasing batch sizes improves the accuracy of gradient estimation in FL and\nthus reduces the number of communication rounds required for convergence, but\nresults in higher per-round latency, and vice versa.

We consider scenarios\nin which agents' active days differ, leading to dynamic states as agents drop\nout of the decision process. To address this problem from different\nperspectives, we define three distinct competitive ratios: overall,\nstate-dependent, and individual rational.

Our deterministic\npolicies employ state-aware threshold functions that adapt to the dynamic\nstates, while our randomized policies sample and resample thresholds from\ntailored state-aware distributions.

However, MLLMs continue to\nstruggle with object hallucinations, where models produce seemingly plausible\nbut factually incorrect outputs, including objects that do not exist in the\nimage. Recent work has revealed that the prior knowledge in MLLMs significantly\nsuppresses visual information in deep layers, causing hallucinatory outputs.\nHowever, how these priors suppress visual information at the intermediate layer\nstage in MLLMs remains unclear. We observe that visual factual knowledge and\nthe differences between intermediate-layer prior/original probability\ndistributions show similar evolutionary trends in intermediate layers.\nMotivated by this, we introduce Decoding by Extracting Visual Facts (EVA), a\nsimple, training-free method that dynamically selects intermediate layers with\nthe most significant visual factual information. By contrasting the output\ndistributions of the selected layer derived from the original input and\npure-text input, EVA extracts visual factual knowledge and proportionally\nincorporates it into the final layer to correct the output logits. Importantly,\nEVA is model-agnostic, seamlessly integrates with various classic decoding\nstrategies, and is applicable across different MLLMs. We validate EVA on\nwidely-used benchmarks, and the results show that it significantly reduces\nhallucination rates compared to baseline methods, underscoring its\neffectiveness in mitigating hallucinations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aEVA\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u63d0\u53d6\u89c6\u89c9\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u7ed3\u5408\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u7269\u4f53\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u770b\u4f3c\u5408\u7406\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5728\u6df1\u5c42\u6291\u5236\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u7684\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEVA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u539f\u59cb\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u89c6\u89c9\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4fe1\u606f\u6700\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5c42\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6574\u5408\u5230\u6700\u7ec8\u5c42\u4ee5\u4fee\u6b63\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cEVA\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "EVA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3MLLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u517c\u5bb9\u591a\u79cd\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Notably, WR-EFM\nimproves Category 2 accuracy by 5.5% compared to GCN, verifying the\neffectiveness of WR-guided fusion in capturing complex structural patterns.\nThis work provides a novel paradigm for handling class-imbalanced graph\nclassification tasks.

We first\ntrain the teacher model using labeled face images, then use it to generate\npseudo-labels for a set of unlabeled images. These pseudo-labeled samples are\nused in two ways: (1) to distill knowledge into the student model, and (2) to\ncombine with the original labeled images to further enhance the teacher model\nthrough self-training. The enhanced teacher model is used to further\npseudo-label another set of unlabeled images for distilling the student models.\nThe student model is trained using a combination of labeled images,\npseudo-labeled images from the original teacher model, and pseudo-labeled\nimages from the enhanced teacher model.

In this paper, we propose TokensGen, a novel two-stage\nframework that leverages condensed tokens to address these issues. Our method\ndecomposes long video generation into three core tasks: (1) inner-clip semantic\ncontrol, (2) long-term consistency control, and (3) inter-clip smooth\ntransition. First, we train To2V (Token-to-Video), a short video diffusion\nmodel guided by text and video tokens, with a Video Tokenizer that condenses\nshort clips into semantically rich tokens. Second, we introduce T2To\n(Text-to-Token), a video token diffusion transformer that generates all tokens\nat once, ensuring global consistency across clips. Finally, during inference,\nan adaptive FIFO-Diffusion strategy seamlessly connects adjacent clips,\nreducing boundary artifacts and enhancing smooth transitions. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances long-term temporal\nand content coherence without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. By\nleveraging condensed tokens and pre-trained short video models, our method\nprovides a scalable, modular solution for long video generation, opening new\npossibilities for storytelling, cinematic production, and immersive\nsimulations.

Although existing methods\nachieve comparable performance, they inevitably suffer from performance\ndegradation under sample heterogeneity caused by multi-source data and\nindividual expression variability. To address these challenges, we propose a\nnovel framework, called Heterogeneity-aware Distributional Framework (HDF), and\ndesign two plug-and-play modules to enhance time-frequency modeling and\nmitigate optimization imbalance caused by hard samples. Specifically, the\nTime-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM) captures both temporal\nconsistency and frequency robustness through a dual-branch attention design,\nimproving tolerance to sequence inconsistency and visual style shifts. Then,\nbased on gradient sensitivity and information bottleneck principles, an\nadaptive optimization module Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM) is\nintroduced to dynamically balance classification and contrastive losses,\nenabling more stable and discriminative representation learning.

Despite notable\nadvances with recent efforts, current techniques still lag behind human\ncapabilities in handling drastic visual variations, occlusions, and complex\nscene changes. This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance\nmatching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that\nenables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap,\nwe propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that\nshifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and\nutilization of high-level, object-centric representations. SeC employs Large\nVision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames,\nconstructing robust conceptual priors. During inference, SeC forms a\ncomprehensive semantic representation of the target based on processed frames,\nrealizing robust segmentation of follow-up frames. Furthermore, SeC adaptively\nbalances LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching,\ndynamically adjusting computational efforts based on scene complexity. To\nrigorously assess VOS methods in scenarios demanding high-level conceptual\nreasoning and robust semantic understanding, we introduce the Semantic Complex\nScenarios Video Object Segmentation benchmark (SeCVOS).
