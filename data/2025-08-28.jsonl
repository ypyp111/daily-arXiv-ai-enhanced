In our experiment a flat plate is\naccelerated through water using a robotic arm. This geometry is simple enough\nto allow analytic potential flow streamlines. The monitored plate position\nshows an oscillatory component of the acceleration, which adds an additional\ntest of the Josephson-Anderson relation. The instantaneous velocity field is\nmeasured using particle image velocimetry. It enables us to evaluate Eq. 3.50\nfrom [1] and compare its prediction to the measured drag force. We find\nexcellent agreement, and, most remarkably find that the added mass contribution\nto the drag force still stands out after the flow has turned vortical. We\nfinally comment on the requirements on the experimental techniques for\nevaluating the Josephson-Anderson relation."}

On the\ncontrary, providing the monitor with more information about the agent is less\nhelpful than expected. Second, monitor scaffolding matters more than monitor\nawareness: the hybrid scaffolding consistently outperforms baseline monitor\nscaffolding, and can enable weaker models to reliably monitor stronger agents\n-- a weak-to-strong scaling effect.

Previous studies have attempted to compress retrieved\ndocuments into shorter texts before in-context integration, but such methods\noften compromise end-task performance. The lack of well-defined compression\ntargets forces many approaches to rely on fixed heuristics, which cannot\nguarantee that the compressed content will effectively support the end task.

Across four\nindependent clinical cohorts, PRISM consistently surpasses classical survival\nprediction models and state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning baselines under\ninternal and external validation. Further clinical findings demonstrate that\nthe combined imaging and EHR representations derived from PRISM provide\nvaluable insights into cardiac risk across diverse cohorts. Three distinct\nimaging signatures associated with elevated MACE risk are uncovered, including\nlateral wall dyssynchrony, inferior wall hypersensitivity, and anterior\nelevated focus during diastole. Prompt-guided attribution further identifies\nhypertension, diabetes, and smoking as dominant contributors among clinical and\nphysiological EHR factors."}

For example, simply\nchanging variable names can sway the size of prediction error by as much as 82%\nin certain settings. Such prediction sensitivity with respect to\ntask-irrelevant variations manifests under both in-context learning and\nsupervised fine-tuning, for both close-weight and open-weight general-purpose\nLLMs. Moreover, by examining the attention scores of an open-weight LLM, we\ndiscover a non-uniform attention pattern: training examples and variable\nnames/values which happen to occupy certain positions in the prompt receive\nmore attention when output tokens are generated, even though different\npositions are expected to receive roughly the same attention.

However, most DNN-based methods suffer from catastrophic\nforgetting and fail to maintain their performance in previously learned\nscenarios after adapting to new data. Recent continual learning (CL) studies\naim to mitigate this phenomenon by enhancing memory stability of DNN, i.e., the\nability to retain learned knowledge. Yet, excessive emphasis on the memory\nstability often impairs learning plasticity, i.e., the capacity of DNN to\nacquire new information effectively. To address such stability-plasticity\ndilemma, this study proposes a novel CL method, synergetic memory rehearsal\n(SyReM), for DNN-based motion forecasting. SyReM maintains a compact memory\nbuffer to represent learned knowledge. To ensure memory stability, it employs\nan inequality constraint that limits increments in the average loss over the\nmemory buffer. Synergistically, a selective memory rehearsal mechanism is\ndesigned to enhance learning plasticity by selecting samples from the memory\nbuffer that are most similar to recently observed data. This selection is based\non an online-measured cosine similarity of loss gradients, ensuring targeted\nmemory rehearsal. Since replayed samples originate from learned scenarios, this\nmemory rehearsal mechanism avoids compromising memory stability. We validate\nSyReM under an online CL paradigm where training samples from diverse scenarios\narrive as a one-pass stream. Experiments on 11 naturalistic driving datasets\nfrom INTERACTION demonstrate that, compared to non-CL and CL baselines, SyReM\nsignificantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting in past scenarios while\nimproving forecasting accuracy in new ones.

We also provide\nactionable intuitions to identify when such quantum advantages may arise in\nreal-world settings. We perform benchmarking experiments on both a synthetic\nquantum dataset and the QM9 molecular dataset, using both simulated and real\nphotonic quantum processors. Our results demonstrate that quantum latent\ndistributions can lead to improved generative performance in GANs compared to a\nrange of classical baselines.

Although such models are routinely fine-tuned for\ndownstream NLP tasks, recent work shows they remain vulnerable to backdoor\nattacks that survive vanilla fine-tuning. These attacks are difficult to defend\nbecause end users typically lack knowledge of the attack triggers. Such attacks\nconsist of stealthy malicious triggers introduced through subtle syntactic or\nstylistic manipulations, which can bypass traditional detection and remain in\nthe model, making post-hoc purification essential. In this study, we explore\nwhether attention-head pruning can mitigate these threats without any knowledge\nof the trigger or access to a clean reference model. To this end, we design and\nimplement six pruning-based strategies: (i) gradient-based pruning, (ii)\nlayer-wise variance pruning, (iii) gradient-based pruning with structured L1/L2\nsparsification, (iv) randomized ensemble pruning, (v)\nreinforcement-learning-guided pruning, and (vi) Bayesian uncertainty pruning.\nEach method iteratively removes the least informative heads while monitoring\nvalidation accuracy to avoid over-pruning.

Small vision-language models (sVLMs)\nsuch as ViLT, VisualBERT and FLAVA therefore lag behind their larger generative\ncounterparts. To study the effect of careful commonsense knowledge integration\non sVLMs, we present an end-to-end framework (NLKI) that (i) retrieves natural\nlanguage facts, (ii) prompts an LLM to craft natural language explanations, and\n(iii) feeds both signals to sVLMs respectively across two commonsense VQA\ndatasets (CRIC, AOKVQA) and a visual-entailment dataset (e-SNLI-VE). Facts\nretrieved using a fine-tuned ColBERTv2 and an object information-enriched\nprompt yield explanations that largely cut down hallucinations, while lifting\nthe end-to-end answer accuracy by up to 7% (across 3 datasets), making FLAVA\nand other models in NLKI match or exceed medium-sized VLMs such as Qwen-2 VL-2B\nand SmolVLM-2.5B.

We\nrun MRT on existing LLM monitor scaffoldings, which orchestrate LLMs and parse\nagent trajectories, alongside a new hybrid hierarchical-sequential scaffolding\nproposed in this work. Our empirical results yield three key findings. First,\nagent awareness dominates monitor awareness: an agent's knowledge that it is\nbeing monitored substantially degrades the monitor's reliability. On the\ncontrary, providing the monitor with more information about the agent is less\nhelpful than expected. Second, monitor scaffolding matters more than monitor\nawareness: the hybrid scaffolding consistently outperforms baseline monitor\nscaffolding, and can enable weaker models to reliably monitor stronger agents\n-- a weak-to-strong scaling effect. Third, in a human-in-the-loop setting where\nhumans discuss with the LLM monitor to get an updated judgment for the agent's\nbehavior, targeted human oversight is most effective; escalating only\npre-flagged cases to human reviewers improved the TPR by approximately 15% at\nFPR = 0.01.

Existing knowledge integration solutions\ntypically rely on strong assumptions about training data distributions and\nnetwork architectures, limiting them to learning only from specific types of\nmodels and resulting in data and/or inductive biases. In this work, we\nintroduce a novel framework, namely UNIFORM, for knowledge transfer from a\ndiverse set of off-the-shelf models into one student model without such\nconstraints.

The task of predicting pedestrian crossing intention involves\ndetermining whether pedestrians in the scene are likely to cross the road or\nnot. In this work, we propose TrajFusionNet, a novel transformer-based model\nthat combines future pedestrian trajectory and vehicle speed predictions as\npriors for predicting crossing intention. TrajFusionNet comprises two branches:\na Sequence Attention Module (SAM) and a Visual Attention Module (VAM). The SAM\nbranch learns from a sequential representation of the observed and predicted\npedestrian trajectory and vehicle speed. Complementarily, the VAM branch\nenables learning from a visual representation of the predicted pedestrian\ntrajectory by overlaying predicted pedestrian bounding boxes onto scene images.\nBy utilizing a small number of lightweight modalities, TrajFusionNet achieves\nthe lowest total inference time (including model runtime and data\npreprocessing) among current state-of-the-art approaches.

This problem has broad applications in prompt tuning and\nchain-of-thought reasoning. Since model weights remain fixed during in-context\nlearning, previous work has sought to design methods based on the similarity of\ntoken embeddings. This work proposes a new approach based on gradients of the\noutput taken in the input embedding space. Our approach estimates model outputs\nthrough a first-order approximation using the gradients.
