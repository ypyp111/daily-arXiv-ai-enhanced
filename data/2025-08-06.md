Abstract: Recently, a significant improvement in the accuracy of 3D human pose
estimation has been achieved by combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
with pyramid grid alignment feedback loops. Additionally, innovative
breakthroughs have been made in the field of computer vision through the
adoption of Transformer-based temporal analysis architectures. Given these
advancements, this study aims to deeply optimize and improve the existing Pymaf
network architecture. The main innovations of this paper include: (1)
Introducing a Transformer feature extraction network layer based on
self-attention mechanisms to enhance the capture of low-level features; (2)
Enhancing the understanding and capture of temporal signals in video sequences
through feature temporal fusion techniques; (3) Implementing spatial pyramid
structures to achieve multi-scale feature fusion, effectively balancing feature
representations differences across different scales. The new PyCAT4 model
obtained in this study is validated through experiments on the COCO and 3DPW
datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed improvement strategies
significantly enhance the network's detection capability in human pose
estimation, further advancing the development of human pose estimation
technology.

Conclusion: DreamVVT通过两阶段设计和预训练模型的结合，有效解决了视频虚拟试穿中的细节保留和时间一致性问题。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on (VVT) technology has garnered considerable academic
interest owing to its promising applications in e-commerce advertising and
entertainment. However, most existing end-to-end methods rely heavily on scarce
paired garment-centric datasets and fail to effectively leverage priors of
advanced visual models and test-time inputs, making it challenging to
accurately preserve fine-grained garment details and maintain temporal
consistency in unconstrained scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose
DreamVVT, a carefully designed two-stage framework built upon Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs), which is inherently capable of leveraging diverse unpaired
human-centric data to enhance adaptability in real-world scenarios. To further
leverage prior knowledge from pretrained models and test-time inputs, in the
first stage, we sample representative frames from the input video and utilize a
multi-frame try-on model integrated with a vision-language model (VLM), to
synthesize high-fidelity and semantically consistent keyframe try-on images.
These images serve as complementary appearance guidance for subsequent video
generation. \textbf{In the second stage}, skeleton maps together with
fine-grained motion and appearance descriptions are extracted from the input
content, and these along with the keyframe try-on images are then fed into a
pretrained video generation model enhanced with LoRA adapters. This ensures
long-term temporal coherence for unseen regions and enables highly plausible
dynamic motions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate
that DreamVVT surpasses existing methods in preserving detailed garment content
and temporal stability in real-world scenarios. Our project page

### [3] [Elucidating the Role of Feature Normalization in IJEPA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02829)
*Adam Colton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出在IJEPA架构中用DynTanh激活替代层归一化（LN），以保留视觉标记的自然能量层级，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LN破坏了视觉标记的自然能量层级，导致语义重要区域无法被优先处理，且产生棋盘状伪影。

Method: 用DynTanh激活替代LN，保留标记能量，使高能量标记对预测损失贡献更大。

Result: 改进后模型在ImageNet线性探测准确率从38%提升至42.7%，NYU Depth V2深度估计RMSE降低0.08。

Conclusion: 保留标记自然能量对自监督视觉表示学习至关重要。

Abstract: In the standard image joint embedding predictive architecture (IJEPA),
features at the output of the teacher encoder are layer normalized (LN) before
serving as a distillation target for the student encoder and predictor. We
propose that this feature normalization disrupts the natural energy hierarchy
of visual tokens, where high-energy tokens (those with larger L2 norms) encode
semantically important image regions. LN forces all features to have identical
L2 norms, effectively equalizing their energies and preventing the model from
prioritizing semantically rich regions. We find that IJEPA models trained with
feature LN exhibit loss maps with significant checkerboard-like artifacts. We
propose that feature LN be replaced with a DynTanh activation as the latter
better preserves token energies and allows high-energy tokens to greater
contribute to the prediction loss. We show that IJEPA trained with feature
DynTanh exhibits a longer-tailed loss distribution and fixes the checkerboard
artifacts in the loss map. Our empirical results show that our simple
modification improves ImageNet linear probe accuracy from 38% to 42.7% for
ViT-Small and reduces RMSE by 0.08 on NYU Depth V2 monocular depth estimation.
These results suggest that preserving natural token energies is crucial for
effective self-supervised visual representation learning.

### [4] [GENIE: Gaussian Encoding for Neural Radiance Fields Interactive Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02831)
*Mikołaj Zieliński,Krzysztof Byrski,Tomasz Szczepanik,Przemysław Spurek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GENIE结合了NeRF的高保真渲染和Gaussian Splatting的可编辑性，通过混合模型实现实时交互编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决NeRF难以编辑和物理交互的问题，同时保留其高质量渲染能力。

Method: 使用可训练特征嵌入的高斯基元，结合RT-GPS快速搜索和多分辨率哈希网格，实现高效编辑。

Result: 支持实时、局部感知的编辑，动态交互和物理模拟兼容。

Conclusion: GENIE填补了几何编辑与神经渲染之间的空白，提供了直观的场景操作能力。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting (GS) have recently
transformed 3D scene representation and rendering. NeRF achieves high-fidelity
novel view synthesis by learning volumetric representations through neural
networks, but its implicit encoding makes editing and physical interaction
challenging. In contrast, GS represents scenes as explicit collections of
Gaussian primitives, enabling real-time rendering, faster training, and more
intuitive manipulation. This explicit structure has made GS particularly
well-suited for interactive editing and integration with physics-based
simulation. In this paper, we introduce GENIE (Gaussian Encoding for Neural
Radiance Fields Interactive Editing), a hybrid model that combines the
photorealistic rendering quality of NeRF with the editable and structured
representation of GS. Instead of using spherical harmonics for appearance
modeling, we assign each Gaussian a trainable feature embedding. These
embeddings are used to condition a NeRF network based on the k nearest
Gaussians to each query point. To make this conditioning efficient, we
introduce Ray-Traced Gaussian Proximity Search (RT-GPS), a fast nearest
Gaussian search based on a modified ray-tracing pipeline. We also integrate a
multi-resolution hash grid to initialize and update Gaussian features.
Together, these components enable real-time, locality-aware editing: as
Gaussian primitives are repositioned or modified, their interpolated influence
is immediately reflected in the rendered output. By combining the strengths of
implicit and explicit representations, GENIE supports intuitive scene
manipulation, dynamic interaction, and compatibility with physical simulation,
bridging the gap between geometry-based editing and neural rendering. The code
can be found under (https://github.com/MikolajZielinski/genie)

### [5] [RefineSeg: Dual Coarse-to-Fine Learning for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02844)
*Anghong Du,Nay Aung,Theodoros N. Arvanitis,Stefan K. Piechnik,Joao A C Lima,Steffen E. Petersen,Le Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于粗标注的医学图像分割框架，通过建模粗标注的不准确性，逐步优化分割结果，性能接近全监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像的高质量像素级标注成本高且需专业知识，粗标注虽易获取但存在噪声。

Method: 引入转移矩阵建模粗标注的不准确区域，通过多组粗标注联合训练逐步优化分割结果。

Result: 在ACDC、MSCMRseg和UK Biobank数据集上表现优异，超越弱监督方法，接近全监督方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效利用粗标注，为医学图像分割提供了一种低成本高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: High-quality pixel-level annotations of medical images are essential for
supervised segmentation tasks, but obtaining such annotations is costly and
requires medical expertise. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
coarse-to-fine segmentation framework that relies entirely on coarse-level
annotations, encompassing both target and complementary drawings, despite their
inherent noise. The framework works by introducing transition matrices in order
to model the inaccurate and incomplete regions in the coarse annotations. By
jointly training on multiple sets of coarse annotations, it progressively
refines the network's outputs and infers the true segmentation distribution,
achieving a robust approximation of precise labels through matrix-based
modeling. To validate the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed method,
we demonstrate the results on two public cardiac imaging datasets, ACDC and
MSCMRseg, and further evaluate its performance on the UK Biobank dataset.
Experimental results indicate that our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art
weakly supervised methods and closely matches the fully supervised approach.

### [6] [MIDAR: Mimicking LiDAR Detection for Traffic Applications with a Lightweight Plug-and-Play Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02858)
*Tianheng Zhu,Yiheng Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIDAR是一个LiDAR检测模拟模型，用于在微观交通模拟器中生成接近真实的LiDAR检测结果，填补了高保真模拟器与可扩展性模拟器之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大规模真实自动驾驶车辆部署不现实，现有模拟器在保真度和可扩展性之间存在矛盾，需要一种方法在微观交通模拟器中生成真实的LiDAR检测数据。

Method: MIDAR通过车辆级特征预测真实LiDAR检测结果，构建RM-LoS图编码遮挡关系，并使用GRU增强的APPNP架构进行特征传播。

Result: MIDAR在nuScenes数据集上达到了0.909的AUC，接近主流3D LiDAR检测模型CenterPoint的结果。

Conclusion: MIDAR成功填补了模拟器的空白，并在交通应用中验证了其必要性，未来将开源。

Abstract: As autonomous driving (AD) technology advances, increasing research has
focused on leveraging cooperative perception (CP) data collected from multiple
AVs to enhance traffic applications. Due to the impracticality of large-scale
real-world AV deployments, simulation has become the primary approach in most
studies. While game-engine-based simulators like CARLA generate high-fidelity
raw sensor data (e.g., LiDAR point clouds) which can be used to produce
realistic detection outputs, they face scalability challenges in multi-AV
scenarios. In contrast, microscopic traffic simulators such as SUMO scale
efficiently but lack perception modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we
propose MIDAR, a LiDAR detection mimicking model that approximates realistic
LiDAR detections using vehicle-level features readily available from
microscopic traffic simulators. Specifically, MIDAR predicts true positives
(TPs) and false negatives (FNs) from ideal LiDAR detection results based on the
spatial layouts and dimensions of surrounding vehicles. A Refined Multi-hop
Line-of-Sight (RM-LoS) graph is constructed to encode the occlusion
relationships among vehicles, upon which MIDAR employs a GRU-enhanced APPNP
architecture to propagate features from the ego AV and occluding vehicles to
the prediction target. MIDAR achieves an AUC of 0.909 in approximating the
detection results generated by CenterPoint, a mainstream 3D LiDAR detection
model, on the nuScenes AD dataset. Two CP-based traffic applications further
validate the necessity of such realistic detection modeling, particularly for
tasks requiring accurate individual vehicle observations (e.g., position,
speed, lane index). As demonstrated in the applications, MIDAR can be
seamlessly integrated into traffic simulators and trajectory datasets and will
be open-sourced upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文比较了基于Transformer的神经网络和卷积神经网络在卫星图像目标检测中的性能，展示了Transformer架构的先进表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着Visual Transformers的出现，需要了解其在卫星图像处理中的表现，并与传统卷积网络进行大规模比较。

Method: 比较了11种目标检测算法（包括5种Transformer架构和6种卷积网络），在三个公开的高分辨率遥感数据集上训练和评估了33个模型。

Result: Transformer架构在多种基准数据集上表现出色，展示了其在卫星图像处理中的潜力。

Conclusion: Transformer-based神经网络在卫星图像目标检测中具有显著优势，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: In 2012, AlexNet established deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) as
the state-of-the-art in CV, as these networks soon led in visual tasks for many
domains, including remote sensing. With the publication of Visual Transformers,
we are witnessing the second modern leap in computational vision, and as such,
it is imperative to understand how various transformer-based neural networks
perform on satellite imagery. While transformers have shown high levels of
performance in natural language processing and CV applications, they have yet
to be compared on a large scale to modern remote sensing data. In this paper,
we explore the use of transformer-based neural networks for object detection in
high-resolution electro-optical satellite imagery, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance on a variety of publicly available benchmark data
sets. We compare eleven distinct bounding-box detection and localization
algorithms in this study, of which seven were published since 2020, and all
eleven since 2015. The performance of five transformer-based architectures is
compared with six convolutional networks on three state-of-the-art opensource
high-resolution remote sensing imagery datasets ranging in size and complexity.
Following the training and evaluation of thirty-three deep neural models, we
then discuss and analyze model performance across various feature extraction
methodologies and detection algorithms.

### [8] [VisuCraft: Enhancing Large Vision-Language Models for Complex Visual-Guided Creative Content Generation via Structured Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02890)
*Rongxin Jiang,Robert Long,Chenghao Gu,Mingrui Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisuCraft是一个新框架，通过多模态结构化信息提取器和动态提示生成模块，显著提升大型视觉语言模型在复杂视觉引导创意内容生成中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在生成长文本时难以保持高视觉保真度、真实创意和精确遵循用户指令。

Method: VisuCraft整合了多模态结构化信息提取器（E）和动态提示生成模块（G），提取图像的细粒度视觉属性并生成优化提示。

Result: 在ImageStoryGen-500K数据集上评估，VisuCraft在故事生成和诗歌创作等任务中表现优于基线模型，尤其在创意和指令遵循方面。

Conclusion: VisuCraft为大型视觉语言模型在复杂创意AI应用中开辟了新潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces VisuCraft, a novel framework designed to significantly
enhance the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in complex
visual-guided creative content generation. Existing LVLMs often exhibit
limitations in maintaining high visual fidelity, genuine creativity, and
precise adherence to nuanced user instructions when generating long-form texts.
VisuCraft addresses these challenges by integrating a multimodal structured
information extractor (E) and a dynamic prompt generation module (G). The
extractor distills fine-grained visual attributes from input images into a
rich, structured representation, which the dynamic prompt module then combines
with user instructions to create highly optimized prompts for underlying LVLMs
(e.g., LLaVA, InstructBLIP). Evaluated on the self-constructed
ImageStoryGen-500K dataset using VisuGen Metrics (Visual Grounding, Creativity,
and Instruction Adherence), VisuCraft consistently outperforms baseline LVLMs
across tasks like story generation and poetry composition. Our results
demonstrate remarkable improvements, particularly in creativity and instruction
adherence, validating VisuCraft's effectiveness in producing imaginative,
visually grounded, and user-aligned long-form creative text. This work unlocks
new potential for LVLMs in sophisticated creative AI applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型需依赖正常数据训练，限制了实际应用；本文旨在解决仅含污染数据时的异常分割问题。

Result: 在MVTec数据集上，AUROC提升8.08%，AUPRC提升10.37%，优于现有扩散模型。

Conclusion: 提出的鲁棒扩散模型在污染数据场景下表现优异，为异常分割提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated significant success
in unsupervised anomaly segmentation. For anomaly segmentation, these models
are first trained on normal data; then, an anomalous image is noised to an
intermediate step, and the normal image is reconstructed through backward
diffusion. Unlike traditional statistical methods, diffusion models do not rely
on specific assumptions about the data or target anomalies, making them
versatile for use across different domains. However, diffusion models typically
assume access to normal data for training, limiting their applicability in
realistic settings. In this paper, we propose novel robust denoising diffusion
models for scenarios where only contaminated (i.e., a mix of normal and
anomalous) unlabeled data is available. By casting maximum likelihood
estimation of the data as a nonlinear regression problem, we reinterpret the
denoising diffusion probabilistic model through a regression lens. Using robust
regression, we derive a robust version of denoising diffusion probabilistic
models. Our novel framework offers flexibility in constructing various robust
diffusion models. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms current
state of the art diffusion models, for unsupervised anomaly segmentation when
only contaminated data is available. Our method outperforms existing
diffusion-based approaches, achieving up to 8.08\% higher AUROC and 10.37\%
higher AUPRC on MVTec datasets. The implementation code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过用户定义的材料配置（如地毯和吸音墙）动态改变室内声学特性。

Result: 模型能够生成多样化的RIR，并在新数据集上优于基线方法和现有技术。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效编码材料信息并生成高保真RIR，为动态声学配置提供了实用工具。

Abstract: How would the sound in a studio change with a carpeted floor and acoustic
tiles on the walls? We introduce the task of material-controlled acoustic
profile generation, where, given an indoor scene with specific audio-visual
characteristics, the goal is to generate a target acoustic profile based on a
user-defined material configuration at inference time. We address this task
with a novel encoder-decoder approach that encodes the scene's key properties
from an audio-visual observation and generates the target Room Impulse Response
(RIR) conditioned on the material specifications provided by the user. Our
model enables the generation of diverse RIRs based on various material
configurations defined dynamically at inference time. To support this task, we
create a new benchmark, the Acoustic Wonderland Dataset, designed for
developing and evaluating material-aware RIR prediction methods under diverse
and challenging settings. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model
effectively encodes material information and generates high-fidelity RIRs,
outperforming several baselines and state-of-the-art methods.

*Vebjørn Haug Kåsene,Pierre Lison*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究表明，现成的大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）可以用于视觉语言导航（VLN）任务，但性能仍不及专为导航设计的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索现成LVLMs在VLN任务中的潜力，并验证其是否支持低级和全景动作范式。

Method: 在Room-to-Room数据集上微调开源模型Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct，评估其在低级和全景动作空间中的表现。

Result: 最佳模型在R2R测试集上达到41%的成功率，表明现成LVLMs虽能学习VLN，但性能不及专用模型。

Conclusion: 现成LVLMs在VLN任务中具有一定潜力，但需进一步优化以缩小与专用模型的差距。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) refers to the task of enabling
autonomous robots to navigate unfamiliar environments by following natural
language instructions. While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have
shown promise in this task, most current VLM systems rely on models
specifically designed and optimized for navigation, leaving the potential of
off-the-shelf LVLMs underexplored. Furthermore, while older VLN approaches used
low-level action spaces with egocentric views and atomic actions (such as "turn
left" or "move forward"), newer models tend to favor panoramic action spaces
with discrete navigable viewpoints. This paper investigates (1) whether
off-the-shelf LVLMs (fine-tuned without architectural modifications or
simulator-based training) can effectively support VLN tasks and (2) whether
such models can support both low-level and panoramic action paradigms. To this
end, we fine-tune the open-source model Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct on the
Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset and evaluate its empirical performance across both
low-level and panoramic action spaces. The best resulting model achieves a 41%
success rate on the R2R test set, demonstrating that while off-the-shelf LVLMs
can learn to perform Vision-and-Language Navigation, they still lag behind
models specifically designed for this task.

Motivation: 研究MAP估计在盲去卷积中的局限性，尤其是其倾向于模糊解的问题，以探索更有效的解决方案。

Method: 使用扩散先验分析图像似然性景观，发现模糊图像似然性更高，并通过理论分析揭示后验的局部极小值对应自然图像。

Conclusion: 克服MAP的局限性需要良好的局部初始化，以找到后验景观中的局部极小值，这对设计更好的先验和优化技术具有实际意义。

Abstract: The Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation is a widely used framework in blind
deconvolution to recover sharp images from blurred observations. The estimated
image and blur filter are defined as the maximizer of the posterior
distribution. However, when paired with sparsity-promoting image priors, MAP
estimation has been shown to favors blurry solutions, limiting its
effectiveness. In this paper, we revisit this result using diffusion-based
priors, a class of models that capture realistic image distributions. Through
an empirical examination of the prior's likelihood landscape, we uncover two
key properties: first, blurry images tend to have higher likelihoods; second,
the landscape contains numerous local minimizers that correspond to natural
images. Building on these insights, we provide a theoretical analysis of the
blind deblurring posterior. This reveals that the MAP estimator tends to
produce sharp filters (close to the Dirac delta function) and blurry solutions.
However local minimizers of the posterior, which can be obtained with gradient
descent, correspond to realistic, natural images, effectively solving the blind
deconvolution problem. Our findings suggest that overcoming MAP's limitations
requires good local initialization to local minima in the posterior landscape.
We validate our analysis with numerical experiments, demonstrating the
practical implications of our insights for designing improved priors and
optimization techniques.

Result: 实验表明，ImageNet预训练对小型模型仍有帮助，但模型过小时鲁棒性提升有限。

Conclusion: 建议实践中仍使用预训练，并避免选择过小的模型，以确保在非理想条件下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Many real-world applications require recognition models that are robust to
different operational conditions and modalities, but at the same time run on
small embedded devices, with limited hardware. While for normal size models,
pre-training is known to be very beneficial in accuracy and robustness, for
small models, that can be employed for embedded and edge devices, its effect is
not clear. In this work, we investigate the effect of ImageNet pretraining on
increasingly small backbone architectures (ultra-small models, with $<$1M
parameters) with respect to robustness in downstream object detection tasks in
the infrared visual modality. Using scaling laws derived from standard object
recognition architectures, we construct two ultra-small backbone families and
systematically study their performance. Our experiments on three different
datasets reveal that while ImageNet pre-training is still useful, beyond a
certain capacity threshold, it offers diminishing returns in terms of
out-of-distribution detection robustness. Therefore, we advise practitioners to
still use pre-training and, when possible avoid too small models as while they
might work well for in-domain problems, they are brittle when working
conditions are different.

TL;DR: X-Actor是一个新颖的音频驱动肖像动画框架，通过单张参考图像和音频片段生成逼真、情感丰富的说话头部视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多关注唇部同步和短时视觉保真度，而X-Actor旨在实现演员级的长时肖像表演，捕捉动态演化的情感。

Method: 采用两阶段解耦生成流程：音频条件自回归扩散模型预测面部运动潜在标记，扩散视频合成模块将其转化为高保真视频。

Result: X-Actor生成了超越标准说话头部动画的电影级表演，在长时音频驱动情感肖像表演中达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: X-Actor通过解耦的面部运动潜在空间和扩散训练范式，实现了无误差积累的无限长度情感丰富运动预测。

Abstract: We present X-Actor, a novel audio-driven portrait animation framework that
generates lifelike, emotionally expressive talking head videos from a single
reference image and an input audio clip. Unlike prior methods that emphasize
lip synchronization and short-range visual fidelity in constrained speaking
scenarios, X-Actor enables actor-quality, long-form portrait performance
capturing nuanced, dynamically evolving emotions that flow coherently with the
rhythm and content of speech. Central to our approach is a two-stage decoupled
generation pipeline: an audio-conditioned autoregressive diffusion model that
predicts expressive yet identity-agnostic facial motion latent tokens within a
long temporal context window, followed by a diffusion-based video synthesis
module that translates these motions into high-fidelity video animations. By
operating in a compact facial motion latent space decoupled from visual and
identity cues, our autoregressive diffusion model effectively captures
long-range correlations between audio and facial dynamics through a
diffusion-forcing training paradigm, enabling infinite-length emotionally-rich

### [15] [Towards Robust Image Denoising with Scale Equivariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02967)
*Dawei Zhang,Xiaojie Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于尺度等变性的盲去噪框架，通过异构归一化模块（HNM）和交互门控模块（IGM）提升模型在空间非均匀噪声下的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去噪模型在空间非均匀噪声（OOD条件）下泛化能力不足，尺度等变性被视为提升鲁棒性的关键。

Method: 提出包含HNM和IGM的盲去噪框架，HNM稳定特征分布并动态校正噪声强度变化，IGM通过门控交互调节信号与特征路径的信息流。

Result: 模型在合成和真实数据集上均优于现有方法，尤其在空间异质噪声下表现突出。

Conclusion: 尺度等变性结合HNM和IGM显著提升了去噪模型在OOD条件下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Despite notable advances in image denoising, existing models often struggle
to generalize beyond in-distribution noise patterns, particularly when
confronted with out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions characterized by spatially
variant noise. This generalization gap remains a fundamental yet underexplored
challenge. In this work, we investigate \emph{scale equivariance} as a core
inductive bias for improving OOD robustness. We argue that incorporating
scale-equivariant structures enables models to better adapt from training on
spatially uniform noise to inference on spatially non-uniform degradations.
Building on this insight, we propose a robust blind denoising framework
equipped with two key components: a Heterogeneous Normalization Module (HNM)
and an Interactive Gating Module (IGM). HNM stabilizes feature distributions
and dynamically corrects features under varying noise intensities, while IGM
facilitates effective information modulation via gated interactions between
signal and feature paths. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our model
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and
real-world benchmarks, especially under spatially heterogeneous noise. Code
will be made publicly available.

*Alakh Desai,Nuno Vasconcelos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ANSWER是一种无需训练的采样技术，通过结合负提示和分类器自由引导（CFG）来提升扩散模型生成图像的提示忠实度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成高质量图像时，提示的忠实度和质量存在显著差异，负提示虽能改善但依赖外部资源且不完整。

Method: 提出ANSWER方法，利用扩散模型内部对否定的理解，结合CFG，实现无需显式负提示的负条件采样。

Result: ANSWER在多个基准测试中优于基线方法，人类评价显示其受欢迎度是其他方法的2倍。

Conclusion: ANSWER是一种高效且通用的方法，显著提升了扩散模型生成图像的提示忠实度。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated an unparalleled ability to create
diverse and high-fidelity images from text prompts. However, they are also
well-known to vary substantially regarding both prompt adherence and quality.
Negative prompting was introduced to improve prompt compliance by specifying
what an image must not contain. Previous works have shown the existence of an
ideal negative prompt that can maximize the odds of the positive prompt. In
this work, we explore relations between negative prompting and classifier-free
guidance (CFG) to develop a sampling procedure, {\it Adaptive Negative Sampling
Without External Resources} (ANSWER), that accounts for both positive and
negative conditions from a single prompt. This leverages the internal
understanding of negation by the diffusion model to increase the odds of
generating images faithful to the prompt. ANSWER is a training-free technique,
applicable to any model that supports CFG, and allows for negative grounding of
image concepts without an explicit negative prompts, which are lossy and
incomplete. Experiments show that adding ANSWER to existing DMs outperforms the
baselines on multiple benchmarks and is preferred by humans 2x more over the
other methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多领域学习架构中，共享和领域特定LoRA是否有效捕捉领域信息尚不明确。

Method: 将共享和领域特定LoRA分别置于预训练权重的列子空间和左零子空间中。

Result: 在UCF101、Kinetics400和HMDB51数据集上验证了方法的有效性，并分析了LoRA权重的维度。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效分离共享和领域特定信息，提升多领域学习性能。

Abstract: Existing architectures of multi-domain learning have two types of adapters:
shared LoRA for all domains and domain-specific LoRA for each particular
domain. However, it remains unclear whether this structure effectively captures
domain-specific information. In this paper, we propose a method that ensures
that shared and domain-specific LoRAs exist in different subspaces;
specifically, the column and left null subspaces of the pre-trained weights. We
apply the proposed method to action recognition with three datasets (UCF101,
Kinetics400, and HMDB51) and demonstrate its effectiveness in some cases along
with the analysis of the dimensions of LoRA weights.

domain adaptation between RGB and edge information using edge frames in
addition to RGB frames to counter the static bias issue. Experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method effectively suppresses static bias with a
lower computational cost, allowing for more robust action recognition than
previous approaches.

TL;DR: AFOG是一种针对目标检测变换器的对抗性扰动方法，通过注意力机制和特征损失提升攻击效果，适用于CNN和变换器检测器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗性扰动方法对变换器检测器效果有限，AFOG旨在填补这一空白。

Method: AFOG利用可学习的注意力机制和特征损失，迭代注入对抗性扰动。

Result: 实验表明AFOG在攻击效果和速度上优于现有方法，提升达83%。

Conclusion: AFOG是一种高效、隐蔽且通用的对抗性攻击方法。

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations are useful tools for exposing vulnerabilities in
neural networks. Existing adversarial perturbation methods for object detection
are either limited to attacking CNN-based detectors or weak against
transformer-based detectors. This paper presents an Attention-Focused Offensive
Gradient (AFOG) attack against object detection transformers. By design, AFOG
is neural-architecture agnostic and effective for attacking both large
transformer-based object detectors and conventional CNN-based detectors with a
unified adversarial attention framework. This paper makes three original
contributions. First, AFOG utilizes a learnable attention mechanism that
focuses perturbations on vulnerable image regions in multi-box detection tasks,
increasing performance over non-attention baselines by up to 30.6%. Second,
AFOG's attack loss is formulated by integrating two types of feature loss
through learnable attention updates with iterative injection of adversarial
perturbations. Finally, AFOG is an efficient and stealthy adversarial
perturbation method. It probes the weak spots of detection transformers by
adding strategically generated and visually imperceptible perturbations which
can cause well-trained object detection models to fail. Extensive experiments
conducted with twelve large detection transformers on COCO demonstrate the
efficacy of AFOG. Our empirical results also show that AFOG outperforms
existing attacks on transformer-based and CNN-based object detectors by up to
83% with superior speed and imperceptibility. Code is available at

*Fan Yang,Yihao Huang,Jiayi Zhu,Ling Shi,Geguang Pu,Jin Song Dong,Kailong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散过程的噪声预测信号检测NSFW内容的方法（IGD），在七类NSFW内容上平均检测准确率达91.32%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注生成前或生成后的内容过滤，而扩散模型生成过程中的NSFW检测尚未充分探索。

Method: 利用扩散过程中预测的噪声作为内部信号，识别NSFW内容。

Result: 在七类NSFW内容上，IGD的平均检测准确率为91.32%，优于七种基线方法。

Conclusion: IGD是一种简单有效的方法，能够在扩散模型生成过程中检测NSFW内容。

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models enable high-quality image
generation but also pose significant risks of misuse, particularly in producing
not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content. While prior detection methods have focused on
filtering prompts before generation or moderating images afterward, the
in-generation phase of diffusion models remains largely unexplored for NSFW
detection. In this paper, we introduce In-Generation Detection (IGD), a simple
yet effective approach that leverages the predicted noise during the diffusion
process as an internal signal to identify NSFW content. This approach is
motivated by preliminary findings suggesting that the predicted noise may
capture semantic cues that differentiate NSFW from benign prompts, even when
the prompts are adversarially crafted. Experiments conducted on seven NSFW
categories show that IGD achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.32% over
naive and adversarial NSFW prompts, outperforming seven baseline methods.

*Xinhui Li,Xiaojie Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MGFC的新框架，通过多粒度特征校准提升域广义语义分割（DGSS）的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注全局特征微调，而忽略了跨特征层次的分层适应，这对密集预测任务至关重要。

Method: MGFC框架通过粗到细的特征校准，依次调整粗粒度、中粒度和细粒度特征，以增强域偏移下的鲁棒性。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，MGFC优于现有DGSS方法，验证了多粒度适应在语义分割任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: MGFC通过分层和粒度感知的特征校准，成功将视觉基础模型（VFMs）的泛化能力迁移到DGSS任务中。

Abstract: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) aims to improve the
generalization ability of models across unseen domains without access to target
data during training. Recent advances in DGSS have increasingly exploited
vision foundation models (VFMs) via parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies.
However, most existing approaches concentrate on global feature fine-tuning,
while overlooking hierarchical adaptation across feature levels, which is
crucial for precise dense prediction. In this paper, we propose
Multi-Granularity Feature Calibration (MGFC), a novel framework that performs
coarse-to-fine alignment of VFM features to enhance robustness under domain
shifts. Specifically, MGFC first calibrates coarse-grained features to capture
global contextual semantics and scene-level structure. Then, it refines
medium-grained features by promoting category-level feature discriminability.
Finally, fine-grained features are calibrated through high-frequency spatial
detail enhancement. By performing hierarchical and granularity-aware
calibration, MGFC effectively transfers the generalization strengths of VFMs to
the domain-specific task of DGSS. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art DGSS approaches,
highlighting the effectiveness of multi-granularity adaptation for the semantic
segmentation task of domain generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的视频问答任务SceneQA，强调场景细节感知和推理能力，并开发了LVSQA数据集。提出SLFG方法，通过语义连贯的场景帧组合提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在长视频中的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在长视频理解中表现不佳，主要因资源限制无法处理所有帧及其信息，且现有框架和任务不切合实际需求。

Method: 提出SLFG方法，结合语义连贯的场景帧，利用场景定位和动态帧重组机制，无需修改原始模型架构。

Result: 实验表明SLFG在多个长视频基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: SLFG方法显著提升了MLLMs在长视频中的理解能力，具有优秀的即插即用性。

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often perform poorly in long
video understanding, primarily due to resource limitations that prevent them
from processing all video frames and their associated information. Efficiently
extracting relevant information becomes a challenging task. Existing frameworks
and evaluation tasks focus on identifying specific frames containing core
objects from a large number of irrelevant frames, which does not align with the
practical needs of real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose a
new scenario under the video question-answering task, SceneQA, which emphasizes
scene-based detail perception and reasoning abilities. And we develop the LVSQA
dataset to support the SceneQA task, which is built upon carefully selected
videos from LVBench and contains a new collection of question-answer pairs to
promote a more fair evaluation of MLLMs' scene perception abilities in long
videos. Inspired by human cognition, we introduce a novel method called SLFG.
The core idea of SLFG is to combine individual frames into semantically
coherent scene frames. By leveraging scene localization methods and dynamic
frame reassembly mechanisms, SLFG significantly enhances the understanding
capabilities of existing MLLMs in long videos. SLFG requires no modification to
the original model architecture and boasts excellent plug-and-play usability.
Experimental results show that this method performs exceptionally well in
several long video benchmark tests. Code and dataset will be released at
http://www.slfg.pkuzwh.cn.

TL;DR: SA-3DGS是一种新方法，通过重要性评分和聚类压缩技术，显著减少3D高斯模型的存储需求，同时保持渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯模型压缩方法难以准确识别不重要的高斯点，导致存储需求高且渲染质量下降。

Method: SA-3DGS通过学习重要性评分识别不重要的高斯点，结合重要性感知聚类和代码本修复模块进行压缩。

Result: 实验显示，该方法实现了高达66倍的压缩，同时保持或提升渲染质量。

Conclusion: SA-3DGS在压缩和渲染质量方面表现优异，并具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting have enhanced efficient and
high-quality novel view synthesis. However, representing scenes requires a
large number of Gaussian points, leading to high storage demands and limiting
practical deployment. The latest methods facilitate the compression of Gaussian
models but struggle to identify truly insignificant Gaussian points in the
scene, leading to a decline in subsequent Gaussian pruning, compression
quality, and rendering performance. To address this issue, we propose SA-3DGS,
a method that significantly reduces storage costs while maintaining rendering
quality. SA-3DGS learns an importance score to automatically identify the least
significant Gaussians in scene reconstruction, thereby enabling effective
pruning and redundancy reduction. Next, the importance-aware clustering module
compresses Gaussians attributes more accurately into the codebook, improving
the codebook's expressive capability while reducing model size. Finally, the
codebook repair module leverages contextual scene information to repair the
codebook, thereby recovering the original Gaussian point attributes and
mitigating the degradation in rendering quality caused by information loss.
Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our method
achieves up to 66x compression while maintaining or even improving rendering
quality. The proposed Gaussian pruning approach is not only adaptable to but
also improves other pruning-based methods (e.g., LightGaussian), showcasing
excellent performance and strong generalization ability.

Result: 在CelebIPVid数据集上，MoCA在面部相似度上优于现有方法5%以上。

Conclusion: MoCA通过改进的身份一致性机制，显著提升了T2V生成的质量。

Abstract: Achieving ID-preserving text-to-video (T2V) generation remains challenging
despite recent advances in diffusion-based models. Existing approaches often
fail to capture fine-grained facial dynamics or maintain temporal identity
coherence. To address these limitations, we propose MoCA, a novel Video
Diffusion Model built on a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, incorporating
a Mixture of Cross-Attention mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts
paradigm. Our framework improves inter-frame identity consistency by embedding
MoCA layers into each DiT block, where Hierarchical Temporal Pooling captures
identity features over varying timescales, and Temporal-Aware Cross-Attention
Experts dynamically model spatiotemporal relationships. We further incorporate
a Latent Video Perceptual Loss to enhance identity coherence and fine-grained
details across video frames. To train this model, we collect CelebIPVid, a
dataset of 10,000 high-resolution videos from 1,000 diverse individuals,
promoting cross-ethnicity generalization. Extensive experiments on CelebIPVid
show that MoCA outperforms existing T2V methods by over 5% across Face
similarity.

Conclusion: VideoForest通过人物级特征统一多视频流，为跨视频理解提供了新范式。

Abstract: Cross-video question answering presents significant challenges beyond
traditional single-video understanding, particularly in establishing meaningful
connections across video streams and managing the complexity of multi-source
information retrieval. We introduce VideoForest, a novel framework that
addresses these challenges through person-anchored hierarchical reasoning. Our
approach leverages person-level features as natural bridge points between
videos, enabling effective cross-video understanding without requiring
end-to-end training. VideoForest integrates three key innovations: 1) a
human-anchored feature extraction mechanism that employs ReID and tracking
algorithms to establish robust spatiotemporal relationships across multiple
video sources; 2) a multi-granularity spanning tree structure that
hierarchically organizes visual content around person-level trajectories; and
3) a multi-agent reasoning framework that efficiently traverses this
hierarchical structure to answer complex cross-video queries. To evaluate our
approach, we develop CrossVideoQA, a comprehensive benchmark dataset
specifically designed for person-centric cross-video analysis. Experimental
results demonstrate VideoForest's superior performance in cross-video reasoning
tasks, achieving 71.93% accuracy in person recognition, 83.75% in behavior
analysis, and 51.67% in summarization and reasoning, significantly
outperforming existing methods. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
cross-video understanding by unifying multiple video streams through
person-level features, enabling sophisticated reasoning across distributed
visual information while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: MIT数据集为多人对话视频生成提供了宝贵资源，CovOG模型为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Existing studies on talking video generation have predominantly focused on
single-person monologues or isolated facial animations, limiting their
applicability to realistic multi-human interactions. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MIT, a large-scale dataset specifically designed for multi-human
talking video generation. To this end, we develop an automatic pipeline that
collects and annotates multi-person conversational videos. The resulting
dataset comprises 12 hours of high-resolution footage, each featuring two to
four speakers, with fine-grained annotations of body poses and speech
interactions. It captures natural conversational dynamics in multi-speaker
scenario, offering a rich resource for studying interactive visual behaviors.
To demonstrate the potential of MIT, we furthur propose CovOG, a baseline model
for this novel task. It integrates a Multi-Human Pose Encoder (MPE) to handle
varying numbers of speakers by aggregating individual pose embeddings, and an
Interactive Audio Driver (IAD) to modulate head dynamics based on
speaker-specific audio features. Together, these components showcase the
feasibility and challenges of generating realistic multi-human talking videos,
establishing MIT as a valuable benchmark for future research. The code is

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FaceMat的新方法，用于解决面部滤镜在遮挡情况下的性能下降问题。该方法通过无trimap的框架估计精细的alpha遮罩，并利用两阶段训练提升效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面部滤镜在遮挡（如手、头发或配饰）时性能下降，需要一种能分离遮挡物与面部的精细遮罩方法。

Method: 提出FaceMat框架，采用两阶段训练：教师模型通过NLL损失估计alpha遮罩和像素级不确定性，学生模型通过自适应知识蒸馏学习。

Result: FaceMat在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，提升了面部滤镜在真实视频场景中的视觉质量和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FaceMat无需辅助输入，适用于实时应用，并通过新数据集CelebAMat支持遮挡感知的面部遮罩任务。

Abstract: Face filters have become a key element of short-form video content, enabling
a wide array of visual effects such as stylization and face swapping. However,
their performance often degrades in the presence of occlusions, where objects
like hands, hair, or accessories obscure the face. To address this limitation,
we introduce the novel task of face matting, which estimates fine-grained alpha
mattes to separate occluding elements from facial regions. We further present
FaceMat, a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework that predicts high-quality
alpha mattes under complex occlusions. Our approach leverages a two-stage
training pipeline: a teacher model is trained to jointly estimate alpha mattes
and per-pixel uncertainty using a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss, and this
uncertainty is then used to guide the student model through spatially adaptive
knowledge distillation. This formulation enables the student to focus on
ambiguous or occluded regions, improving generalization and preserving semantic
consistency. Unlike previous approaches that rely on trimaps or segmentation
masks, our framework requires no auxiliary inputs making it well-suited for
real-time applications. In addition, we reformulate the matting objective by
explicitly treating skin as foreground and occlusions as background, enabling
clearer compositing strategies. To support this task, we newly constructed
CelebAMat, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for
occlusion-aware face matting. Extensive experiments show that FaceMat
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, enhancing the
visual quality and robustness of face filters in real-world, unconstrained
video scenarios. The source code and CelebAMat dataset are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CHARM框架通过互补学习实现模态间和谐而非同质化，显著提升多模态语义分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过特征对齐实现模态同质化，但会削弱各模态独特优势及其互补性。

Method: 提出CHARM框架，包含Mutual Perception Unit（MPU）实现隐式对齐，以及双路径优化策略（CoL和InE）。

Result: 实验表明CHARM在多个数据集和骨干网络上均优于基线，尤其在脆弱模态上表现显著提升。

Conclusion: CHARM将焦点从同质化转向和谐化，实现了多样性的真正互补。

Abstract: Modality-agnostic Semantic Segmentation (MaSS) aims to achieve robust scene
understanding across arbitrary combinations of input modality. Existing methods
typically rely on explicit feature alignment to achieve modal homogenization,
which dilutes the distinctive strengths of each modality and destroys their
inherent complementarity. To achieve cooperative harmonization rather than
homogenization, we propose CHARM, a novel complementary learning framework
designed to implicitly align content while preserving modality-specific
advantages through two components: (1) Mutual Perception Unit (MPU), enabling
implicit alignment through window-based cross-modal interaction, where
modalities serve as both queries and contexts for each other to discover
modality-interactive correspondences; (2) A dual-path optimization strategy
that decouples training into Collaborative Learning Strategy (CoL) for
complementary fusion learning and Individual Enhancement Strategy (InE) for
protected modality-specific optimization. Experiments across multiple datasets
and backbones indicate that CHARM consistently outperform the baselines, with
significant increment on the fragile modalities. This work shifts the focus
from model homogenization to harmonization, enabling cross-modal
complementarity for true harmony in diversity.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel framework, "Comprehensive Optimization and
Refinement through Ensemble Fusion in Domain Adaptation for Person
Re-identification (CORE-ReID)", to address an Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
(UDA) for Person Re-identification (ReID). The framework utilizes CycleGAN to
generate diverse data that harmonizes differences in image characteristics from
different camera sources in the pre-training stage. In the fine-tuning stage,
based on a pair of teacher-student networks, the framework integrates
multi-view features for multi-level clustering to derive diverse pseudo labels.
A learnable Ensemble Fusion component that focuses on fine-grained local
information within global features is introduced to enhance learning
comprehensiveness and avoid ambiguity associated with multiple pseudo-labels.
Experimental results on three common UDAs in Person ReID demonstrate
significant performance gains over state-of-the-art approaches. Additional
enhancements, such as Efficient Channel Attention Block and Bidirectional Mean
Feature Normalization mitigate deviation effects and adaptive fusion of global
and local features using the ResNet-based model, further strengthening the
framework. The proposed framework ensures clarity in fusion features, avoids
ambiguity, and achieves high ac-curacy in terms of Mean Average Precision,
Top-1, Top-5, and Top-10, positioning it as an advanced and effective solution
for the UDA in Person ReID. Our codes and models are available at

Motivation: 现有方法在3D医学图像分割中未能充分利用频率域信息的独特性质（如共轭对称性）以及空间与频率域数据分布的差异，导致全局上下文建模不足。

Method: 提出SSFMamba，采用双分支架构分别提取空间和频率域特征，利用Mamba块融合异构特征，并设计3D多方向扫描机制增强局部与全局线索融合。

Result: 在BraTS2020和BraTS2023数据集上的实验表明，SSFMamba在多种评估指标上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SSFMamba通过有效融合空间与频率域特征，显著提升了3D医学图像分割的性能，尤其在全局上下文建模方面表现突出。

Abstract: In light of the spatial domain's limited capacity for modeling global context
in 3D medical image segmentation, emerging approaches have begun to incorporate
frequency domain representations. However, straightforward feature extraction
strategies often overlook the unique properties of frequency domain
information, such as conjugate symmetry. They also fail to account for the
fundamental differences in data distribution between the spatial and frequency
domains, which can ultimately dilute or obscure the complementary strengths
that frequency-based representations offer. In this paper, we propose SSFMamba,
a Mamba based Symmetry-driven Spatial-Frequency feature fusion network for 3D
medical image segmentation. SSFMamba employs a complementary dual-branch
architecture that extracts features from both the spatial and frequency
domains, and leverages a Mamba block to fuse these heterogeneous features to
preserve global context while reinforcing local details. In the frequency
domain branch, we harness Mamba's exceptional capability to extract global
contextual information in conjunction with the synergistic effect of frequency
domain features to further enhance global modeling. Moreover, we design a 3D
multi-directional scanning mechanism to strengthen the fusion of local and
global cues. Extensive experiments on the BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 提出RobustGS模块，提升3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）在恶劣成像条件下的鲁棒性，实现高质量3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有前馈3DGS方法假设输入多视图图像干净高质量，但实际场景中图像常受噪声、低光或雨等影响，导致重建质量下降。

Method: 引入通用退化学习器和语义感知状态空间模型，增强退化感知并聚合语义相似信息。

Result: 实验表明，RobustGS模块可无缝集成现有方法，在各种退化条件下实现最先进的重建质量。

Conclusion: RobustGS显著提升了前馈3DGS在恶劣条件下的鲁棒性和重建质量。

Abstract: Feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) overcomes the limitations of
optimization-based 3DGS by enabling fast and high-quality reconstruction
without the need for per-scene optimization. However, existing feedforward
approaches typically assume that input multi-view images are clean and
high-quality. In real-world scenarios, images are often captured under
challenging conditions such as noise, low light, or rain, resulting in
inaccurate geometry and degraded 3D reconstruction. To address these
challenges, we propose a general and efficient multi-view feature enhancement
module, RobustGS, which substantially improves the robustness of feedforward
3DGS methods under various adverse imaging conditions, enabling high-quality 3D
reconstruction. The RobustGS module can be seamlessly integrated into existing
pretrained pipelines in a plug-and-play manner to enhance reconstruction
robustness. Specifically, we introduce a novel component, Generalized
Degradation Learner, designed to extract generic representations and
distributions of multiple degradations from multi-view inputs, thereby
enhancing degradation-awareness and improving the overall quality of 3D
reconstruction. In addition, we propose a novel semantic-aware state-space
model. It first leverages the extracted degradation representations to enhance
corrupted inputs in the feature space. Then, it employs a semantic-aware
strategy to aggregate semantically similar information across different views,
enabling the extraction of fine-grained cross-view correspondences and further
improving the quality of 3D representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach, when integrated into existing methods in a plug-and-play
manner, consistently achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across
various types of degradations.

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLMs）构建开放集偏见属性知识库，评估LVLMs在细粒度属性上的公平性。

Result: 实验显示LVLMs在多种属性上存在偏见，且文化、环境及行为因素对决策的影响超过传统人口统计属性。

Conclusion: LVLMs的公平性问题需更广泛关注，尤其是非传统属性的偏见影响。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of applications using Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs), such as GPT-4o, has raised significant concerns about their fairness.
While existing studies primarily focus on demographic attributes such as race
and gender, fairness across a broader range of attributes remains largely
unexplored. In this study, we construct an open-set knowledge base of bias
attributes leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and evaluate the fairness of
LVLMs across finer-grained attributes. Our experimental results reveal that
LVLMs exhibit biased outputs across a diverse set of attributes and further
demonstrate that cultural, environmental, and behavioral factors have a more
pronounced impact on LVLM decision-making than traditional demographic
attributes.

Conclusion: $C^2Aug$通过增加伪袋多样性和对比学习框架，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Recent pseudo-bag augmentation methods for Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL)-based Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification sample instances from a
limited number of bags, resulting in constrained diversity. To address this
issue, we propose Contrastive Cross-Bag Augmentation ($C^2Aug$) to sample
instances from all bags with the same class to increase the diversity of
pseudo-bags. However, introducing new instances into the pseudo-bag increases
the number of critical instances (e.g., tumor instances). This increase results
in a reduced occurrence of pseudo-bags containing few critical instances,
thereby limiting model performance, particularly on test slides with small
tumor areas. To address this, we introduce a bag-level and group-level
contrastive learning framework to enhance the discrimination of features with
distinct semantic meanings, thereby improving model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that $C^2Aug$ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches across multiple evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: 该方法有效且优越，代码将公开。

Abstract: Continual learning is essential for medical image classification systems to
adapt to dynamically evolving clinical environments. The integration of
multimodal information can significantly enhance continual learning of image
classes. However, while existing approaches do utilize textual modality
information, they solely rely on simplistic templates with a class name,
thereby neglecting richer semantic information. To address these limitations,
we propose a novel framework that harnesses visual concepts generated by large
language models (LLMs) as discriminative semantic guidance. Our method
dynamically constructs a visual concept pool with a similarity-based filtering
mechanism to prevent redundancy. Then, to integrate the concepts into the
continual learning process, we employ a cross-modal image-concept attention
module, coupled with an attention loss. Through attention, the module can
leverage the semantic knowledge from relevant visual concepts and produce
class-representative fused features for classification. Experiments on medical
and natural image datasets show our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our method. We
will release the code publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法（如GRPO）在数据效率、优势消失和信用分配上的局限性。

Method: 采用离线训练架构提高样本效率，并引入时序优势重塑（TAS）策略优化信用分配。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，性能提升显著，样本效率提高35%以上。

Conclusion: AVATAR框架在多模态视频推理任务中表现出色，解决了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning over long-horizon video is challenging due to the need
for precise spatiotemporal fusion and alignment across modalities. While recent
methods such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have shown promise in
this domain, they suffer from three key limitations: (1) data inefficiency from
their on-policy design, (2) a vanishing advantage problem, where identical or
near-identical rewards within a group eliminate the learning signal by
producing zero-valued advantages, and (3) uniform credit assignment that fails
to emphasize critical reasoning steps. We introduce AVATAR (Audio-Video Agent
for Alignment and Reasoning), a framework that addresses these limitations
through two core components: (1) an off-policy training architecture that
improves sample efficiency and resolves vanishing advantages by reusing past
experiences with greater reward diversity, and (2) Temporal Advantage Shaping
(TAS), a novel credit assignment strategy that upweights key reasoning phases
during learning. AVATAR achieves strong performance across various benchmarks,
outperforming the Qwen2.5-Omni baseline by +5.4on MMVU, +4.9 on OmniBench, and
+4.5 on Video-Holmes, while demonstrating over 35% higher sample efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本学习(FSL)方法依赖隐式解耦表示，难以有效适应有限标注数据，而多模态对比学习(如CLIP)可线性解耦潜在表示。

Method: CCA结合ICA解耦CLIP视觉特征，并通过单向(微调文本分类器)和双向(跨注意力机制)增强跨模态对齐，线性结合单模态和跨模态分类输出。

Result: 在11个基准数据集上，CCA在少样本性能和分布偏移鲁棒性上均优于现有方法，且计算高效。

Conclusion: CCA通过显式解耦和跨模态对齐增强，显著提升了少样本学习的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) often requires effective adaptation of models using
limited labeled data. However, most existing FSL methods rely on entangled
representations, requiring the model to implicitly recover the unmixing process
to obtain disentangled representations using only limited supervision, which
hinders effective adaptation. Recent theoretical studies show that multimodal
contrastive learning methods, such as CLIP, can disentangle latent
representations up to linear transformations. In light of this, we propose the
Causal CLIP Adapter (CCA), a novel framework that explicitly disentangles
visual features extracted from CLIP using unsupervised Independent Component
Analysis (ICA). This removes the need to learn the unmixing process from the
labeled data, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters and
mitigating overfitting. Taking a step further, while ICA can obtain visual
disentangled representations, it may also disrupt CLIP's intra- and inter-modal
alignment. To counteract this, CCA further leverages CLIP's inherent
cross-modal alignment by enhancing it in two ways: unidirectionally, through
fine-tuning a CLIP-based text classifier, and bidirectionally, via a
cross-attention mechanism that enriches visual and textual representations
through mutual interaction. Both unimodal and cross-modal classification
outputs can be effectively combined linearly to improve classification
accuracy. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of
few-shot performance and robustness to distributional shifts, while maintaining
computational efficiency. Code will be available at

Result: H3R在多个数据集上表现优异，PSNR提升显著（RealEstate10K: 0.59 dB, ACID: 1.06 dB, DTU: 0.22 dB）。

Conclusion: H3R通过混合方法实现了更快的收敛和更好的泛化能力，支持高分辨率输入和跨数据集泛化。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting, generalizable
3D reconstruction remains challenging, particularly in multi-view
correspondence modeling. Existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off:
explicit methods achieve geometric precision but struggle with ambiguous
regions, while implicit methods provide robustness but suffer from slow
convergence. We present H3R, a hybrid framework that addresses this limitation
by integrating volumetric latent fusion with attention-based feature
aggregation. Our framework consists of two complementary components: an
efficient latent volume that enforces geometric consistency through epipolar
constraints, and a camera-aware Transformer that leverages Pl\"ucker
coordinates for adaptive correspondence refinement. By integrating both
paradigms, our approach enhances generalization while converging 2$\times$
faster than existing methods. Furthermore, we show that spatial-aligned
foundation models (e.g., SD-VAE) substantially outperform semantic-aligned
models (e.g., DINOv2), resolving the mismatch between semantic representations
and spatial reconstruction requirements. Our method supports variable-number
and high-resolution input views while demonstrating robust cross-dataset
generalization. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, with significant PSNR
improvements of 0.59 dB, 1.06 dB, and 0.22 dB on the RealEstate10K, ACID, and
DTU datasets, respectively. Code is available at

Conclusion: Landsat30-AU为卫星图像与自然语言交互提供了重要资源，并揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) that enable natural language interaction with
satellite imagery can democratize Earth observation by accelerating expert
workflows, making data accessible to non-specialists, and enabling planet-scale
automation. However, existing datasets focus mainly on short-term,
high-resolution imagery from a limited number of satellites, overlooking
low-resolution, multi-satellite, long-term archives, such as Landsat, that are
essential for affordable and bias-robust global monitoring. We address this gap
with Landsat30-AU, a large-scale vision-language dataset built from 30-meter
resolution imagery collected by four Landsat satellites (5, 7, 8, and 9) over
Australia, spanning more than 36 years. The dataset includes two components:
Landsat30-AU-Cap, containing 196,262 image-caption pairs, and Landsat30-AU-VQA,
comprising 17,725 human-verified visual question answering (VQA) samples across
eight remote sensing domains. Both datasets are curated through a bootstrapped
pipeline that leverages generic VLMs with iterative refinement and human
verification to ensure quality. Our evaluation of eight VLMs on our benchmark
reveals that off-the-shelf models struggle to understand satellite imagery. The
open-source remote-sensing VLM EarthDial achieves only 0.07 SPIDEr in
captioning and a VQA accuracy of 0.48, highlighting the limitations of current
approaches. Encouragingly, lightweight fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-VL-7B on
Landsat30-AU improves captioning performance from 0.11 to 0.31 SPIDEr and
boosts VQA accuracy from \textbf{0.74} to 0.87. Code and data are available at

Abstract: The accurate state estimation of unknown bodies in space is a critical
challenge with applications ranging from the tracking of space debris to the
shape estimation of small bodies. A necessary enabler to this capability is to
find and track features on a continuous stream of images. Existing methods,
such as SIFT, ORB and AKAZE, achieve real-time but inaccurate pose estimates,
whereas modern deep learning methods yield higher quality features at the cost
of more demanding computational resources which might not be available on
space-qualified hardware. Additionally, both classical and data-driven methods
are not robust to the highly opaque self-cast shadows on the object of
interest. We show that, as the target body rotates, these shadows may lead to
large biases in the resulting pose estimates. For these objects, a bias in the
real-time pose estimation algorithm may mislead the spacecraft's state
estimator and cause a mission failure, especially if the body undergoes a
chaotic tumbling motion. We present COFFEE, the Celestial Occlusion Fast
FEature Extractor, a real-time pose estimation framework for asteroids designed
to leverage prior information on the sun phase angle given by sun-tracking
sensors commonly available onboard spacecraft. By associating salient contours
to their projected shadows, a sparse set of features are detected, invariant to
the motion of the shadows. A Sparse Neural Network followed by an
attention-based Graph Neural Network feature matching model are then jointly
trained to provide a set of correspondences between successive frames. The
resulting pose estimation pipeline is found to be bias-free, more accurate than
classical pose estimation pipelines and an order of magnitude faster than other
state-of-the-art deep learning pipelines on synthetic data as well as on
renderings of the tumbling asteroid Apophis.

Abstract: Fire scene datasets are crucial for training robust computer vision models,
particularly in tasks such as fire early warning and emergency rescue
operations. However, among the currently available fire-related data, there is
a significant shortage of annotated data specifically targeting building
units.To tackle this issue, we introduce an annotated dataset of building units
captured by drones, which incorporates multiple enhancement techniques. We
construct backgrounds using real multi-story scenes, combine motion blur and
brightness adjustment to enhance the authenticity of the captured images,
simulate drone shooting conditions under various circumstances, and employ
large models to generate fire effects at different locations.The synthetic
dataset generated by this method encompasses a wide range of building
scenarios, with a total of 1,978 images. This dataset can effectively improve
the generalization ability of fire unit detection, providing multi-scenario and
scalable data while reducing the risks and costs associated with collecting
real fire data. The dataset is available at

Conclusion: UniEdit-I为统一视觉语言模型提供了一种无需训练的高保真图像编辑方法，展示了其在未来应用中的潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, unified vision-language models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced,
effectively tackling both visual understanding and generation tasks within a
single design. While many unified VLMs have explored various design choices,
the recent hypothesis from OpenAI's GPT-4o suggests a promising generation
pipeline: Understanding VLM->Visual Feature->Projector->Diffusion Model->Image.
The understanding VLM is frozen, and only the generation-related modules are
trained. This pipeline maintains the strong capability of understanding VLM
while enabling the image generation ability of the unified VLM. Although this
pipeline has shown very promising potential for the future development of
unified VLM, how to easily enable image editing capability is still unexplored.
In this paper, we introduce a novel training-free framework named UniEdit-I to
enable the unified VLM with image editing capability via three iterative steps:
understanding, editing, and verifying. 1. The understanding step analyzes the
source image to create a source prompt through structured semantic analysis and
makes minimal word replacements to form the target prompt based on the editing
instruction. 2. The editing step introduces a time-adaptive offset, allowing
for coherent editing from coarse to fine throughout the denoising process. 3.
The verification step checks the alignment between the target prompt and the
intermediate edited image, provides automatic consistency scores and corrective
feedback, and determines whether to stop early or continue the editing loop.
This understanding, editing, and verifying loop iterates until convergence,
delivering high-fidelity editing in a training-free manner. We implemented our
method based on the latest BLIP3-o and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on the GEdit-Bench benchmark.

Result: 在MVTec-AD和BTAD数据集上，SARD在分割精度和视觉质量上超越现有方法，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: SARD通过改进扩散过程，显著提升了异常合成的空间精确性和视觉质量。

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic and spatially precise anomalies is essential for
enhancing the robustness of industrial anomaly detection systems. While recent
diffusion-based methods have demonstrated strong capabilities in modeling
complex defect patterns, they often struggle with spatial controllability and
fail to maintain fine-grained regional fidelity. To overcome these limitations,
we propose SARD (Segmentation-Aware anomaly synthesis via Region-constrained
Diffusion with discriminative mask Guidance), a novel diffusion-based framework
specifically designed for anomaly generation. Our approach introduces a
Region-Constrained Diffusion (RCD) process that preserves the background by
freezing it and selectively updating only the foreground anomaly regions during
the reverse denoising phase, thereby effectively reducing background artifacts.
Additionally, we incorporate a Discriminative Mask Guidance (DMG) module into
the discriminator, enabling joint evaluation of both global realism and local
anomaly fidelity, guided by pixel-level masks. Extensive experiments on the
MVTec-AD and BTAD datasets show that SARD surpasses existing methods in
segmentation accuracy and visual quality, setting a new state-of-the-art for
pixel-level anomaly synthesis.

Abstract: Text-driven image editing enables users to flexibly modify visual content
through natural language instructions, and is widely applied to tasks such as
semantic object replacement, insertion, and removal. While recent
inversion-based editing methods using rectified flow models have achieved
promising results in image quality, we identify a structural limitation in
their editing behavior: the semantic bias toward the source concept encoded in
the inverted noise tends to suppress attention to the target concept. This
issue becomes particularly critical when the source and target semantics are
dissimilar, where the attention mechanism inherently leads to editing failure
or unintended modifications in non-target regions. In this paper, we
systematically analyze and validate this structural flaw, and introduce LORE, a
training-free and efficient image editing method. LORE directly optimizes the
inverted noise, addressing the core limitations in generalization and
controllability of existing approaches, enabling stable, controllable, and
general-purpose concept replacement, without requiring architectural
modification or model fine-tuning. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on
three challenging benchmarks: PIEBench, SmartEdit, and GapEdit. Experimental
results show that LORE significantly outperforms strong baselines in terms of
semantic alignment, image quality, and background fidelity, demonstrating the
effectiveness and scalability of latent-space optimization for general-purpose
image editing.

Abstract: Generating accurate, informative, and hallucination-free captions for charts
remains challenging for vision language models, primarily due to the lack of
large-scale, high-quality datasets of real-world charts. However, existing
real-world chart datasets suffer from the inclusion of extraneous information
that cannot be inferred from the chart and failure to sufficiently capture
structural elements and key insights. Therefore, we introduce ChartCap, a
large-scale dataset of 565K real-world chart images paired with type-specific,
dense captions that exclude extraneous information and highlight both
structural elements and key insights in detail. To build ChartCap, we design a
four-stage pipeline that generates captions using only the discernible data
from the chart and employ a cycle consistency-based human verification, which
accelerates quality control without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a novel metric, the Visual Consistency Score, which evaluates caption
quality by measuring the similarity between the chart regenerated from a
caption and the original chart, independent of reference captions. Extensive
experiments confirms that models fine-tuned on ChartCap consistently generate
more accurate and informative captions with reduced hallucinations, surpassing
both open-source and proprietary models and even human-annotated captions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新机制SAVER，用于减少大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在风格化图像上的幻觉问题，并通过实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风格化图像在关键场景（如游戏场景理解、艺术教育和医学分析）中具有重要作用，但现有方法未能有效解决其引发的幻觉问题。

Method: 构建了一个包含摄影图像和风格化图像的数据集，并提出了SAVER机制，通过动态调整LVLM的输出以减少幻觉。

Result: 实验表明，风格化图像比摄影图像更容易引发幻觉，而SAVER在多种模型、数据集和任务中表现最佳。

Conclusion: SAVER能有效减少风格化图像引发的幻觉，提升了LVLM在现实场景中的适用性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) recently achieve significant
breakthroughs in understanding complex visual-textual contexts. However,
hallucination issues still limit their real-world applicability. Although
previous mitigation methods effectively reduce hallucinations in photographic
images, they largely overlook the potential risks posed by stylized images,
which play crucial roles in critical scenarios such as game scene
understanding, art education, and medical analysis. In this work, we first
construct a dataset comprising photographic images and their corresponding
stylized versions with carefully annotated caption labels. We then conduct
head-to-head comparisons on both discriminative and generative tasks by
benchmarking 13 advanced LVLMs on the collected datasets. Our findings reveal
that stylized images tend to induce significantly more hallucinations than
their photographic counterparts. To address this issue, we propose Style-Aware
Visual Early Revision SAVER, a novel mechanism that dynamically adjusts LVLMs'
final outputs based on the token-level visual attention patterns, leveraging
early-layer feedback to mitigate hallucinations caused by stylized images.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAVER achieves state-of-the-art
performance in hallucination mitigation across various models, datasets, and
tasks.

Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅方法依赖计算密集的顺序alpha混合操作，导致资源受限平台上的显著开销。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种场景下表现优异，速度提升1.5至4倍，排序开销减少52.2%至86.9%。

Conclusion: Duplex-GS在保持高质量的同时显著提升了渲染效率，验证了顺序无关渲染在高斯泼溅中的优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable
rendering fidelity and efficiency. However, these methods still rely on
computationally expensive sequential alpha-blending operations, resulting in
significant overhead, particularly on resource-constrained platforms. In this
paper, we propose Duplex-GS, a dual-hierarchy framework that integrates proxy
Gaussian representations with order-independent rendering techniques to achieve
photorealistic results while sustaining real-time performance. To mitigate the
overhead caused by view-adaptive radix sort, we introduce cell proxies for
local Gaussians management and propose cell search rasterization for further
acceleration. By seamlessly combining our framework with Order-Independent
Transparency (OIT), we develop a physically inspired weighted sum rendering
technique that simultaneously eliminates "popping" and "transparency"
artifacts, yielding substantial improvements in both accuracy and efficiency.
Extensive experiments on a variety of real-world datasets demonstrate the
robustness of our method across diverse scenarios, including multi-scale
training views and large-scale environments. Our results validate the
advantages of the OIT rendering paradigm in Gaussian Splatting, achieving
high-quality rendering with an impressive 1.5 to 4 speedup over existing OIT
based Gaussian Splatting approaches and 52.2% to 86.9% reduction of the radix
sort overhead without quality degradation.

Motivation: 单目深度估计存在固有模糊性，需要结合局部和全局信息以提高准确性。

Result: 在NYU-V2和KITTI数据集上表现优异，超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的GLKAM和GBPM模块有效提升了深度估计的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate monocular depth estimation remains a challenging problem due to the
inherent ambiguity that stems from the ill-posed nature of recovering 3D
structure from a single view, where multiple plausible depth configurations can
produce identical 2D projections. In this paper, we present a novel depth
estimation method that combines both local and global cues to improve
prediction accuracy. Specifically, we propose the Gated Large Kernel Attention
Module (GLKAM) to effectively capture multi-scale local structural information
by leveraging large kernel convolutions with a gated mechanism. To further
enhance the global perception of the network, we introduce the Global Bin
Prediction Module (GBPM), which estimates the global distribution of depth bins
and provides structural guidance for depth regression. Extensive experiments on
the NYU-V2 and KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive
performance and outperforms existing approaches, validating the effectiveness
of each proposed component.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于KAN的持续人脸伪造检测框架（KAN-CFD），通过域组KAN检测器和无数据回放特征分离策略，解决了KAN在高维图像建模和特征重叠问题中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸伪造技术的快速发展要求检测器持续适应新方法，但现有方法在学习新类型时会导致对旧类型的性能下降（灾难性遗忘）。KAN因其局部可塑性适合解决这一问题，但存在高维图像建模和特征重叠的局限性。

Method: 提出KAN-CFD框架，包括域组KAN检测器（DG-KD）和无数据回放特征分离策略（FS-KDCP）。DG-KD使KAN适应高维图像输入并保持局部可塑性，FS-KDCP避免输入空间重叠。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在减少遗忘的同时实现了优越性能。

Conclusion: KAN-CFD框架有效解决了KAN在持续学习中的局限性，为人脸伪造检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in face forgery techniques necessitate that detectors
continuously adapt to new forgery methods, thus situating face forgery
detection within a continual learning paradigm. However, when detectors learn
new forgery types, their performance on previous types often degrades rapidly,
a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(KANs) utilize locally plastic splines as their activation functions, enabling
them to learn new tasks by modifying only local regions of the functions while
leaving other areas unaffected. Therefore, they are naturally suitable for
addressing catastrophic forgetting. However, KANs have two significant
limitations: 1) the splines are ineffective for modeling high-dimensional
images, while alternative activation functions that are suitable for images
lack the essential property of locality; 2) in continual learning, when
features from different domains overlap, the mapping of different domains to
distinct curve regions always collapses due to repeated modifications of the
same regions. In this paper, we propose a KAN-based Continual Face Forgery
Detection (KAN-CFD) framework, which includes a Domain-Group KAN Detector
(DG-KD) and a data-free replay Feature Separation strategy via KAN Drift
Compensation Projection (FS-KDCP). DG-KD enables KANs to fit high-dimensional
image inputs while preserving locality and local plasticity. FS-KDCP avoids the
overlap of the KAN input spaces without using data from prior tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior
performance while notably reducing forgetting.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型的多边图卷积交互增强的CNV分割网络（MTG-Net），并构建了首个公开可用的CNV数据集（CNVSeg），用于湿性年龄相关性黄斑变性（wet AMD）的临床评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 湿性AMD是全球致盲的主要原因，而CNV是其典型特征。OCTA图像因其高分辨率和无创性被广泛用于CNV研究，但现有方法在分割不规则CNV区域和血管时面临挑战，且缺乏公开数据集。

Method: MTG-Net通过多任务框架和两个图交互模块（MIGR和MRGR）整合区域和血管形态信息，利用图域中的语义和几何约束进行优化。此外，提出了一种不确定性加权损失以减少噪声和伪影的影响。

Result: 实验结果表明，MTG-Net在区域分割和血管分割上的Dice分数分别达到87.21%和88.12%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MTG-Net和CNVSeg数据集为CNV分割提供了有效工具，有望推动wet AMD的临床研究和应用。

Abstract: Choroidal neovascularization (CNV), a primary characteristic of wet
age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), represents a leading cause of
blindness worldwide. In clinical practice, optical coherence tomography
angiography (OCTA) is commonly used for studying CNV-related pathological
changes, due to its micron-level resolution and non-invasive nature. Thus,
accurate segmentation of CNV regions and vessels in OCTA images is crucial for
clinical assessment of wet AMD. However, challenges existed due to irregular
CNV shapes and imaging limitations like projection artifacts, noises and
boundary blurring. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets
constraints the CNV analysis. To address these challenges, this paper
constructs the first publicly accessible CNV dataset (CNVSeg), and proposes a
novel multilateral graph convolutional interaction-enhanced CNV segmentation
network (MTG-Net). This network integrates both region and vessel morphological
information, exploring semantic and geometric duality constraints within the
graph domain. Specifically, MTG-Net consists of a multi-task framework and two
graph-based cross-task modules: Multilateral Interaction Graph Reasoning (MIGR)
and Multilateral Reinforcement Graph Reasoning (MRGR). The multi-task framework
encodes rich geometric features of lesion shapes and surfaces, decoupling the
image into three task-specific feature maps. MIGR and MRGR iteratively reason
about higher-order relationships across tasks through a graph mechanism,
enabling complementary optimization for task-specific objectives. Additionally,
an uncertainty-weighted loss is proposed to mitigate the impact of artifacts
and noise on segmentation accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that
MTG-Net outperforms existing methods, achieving a Dice socre of 87.21\% for
region segmentation and 88.12\% for vessel segmentation.

Motivation: 现有弱监督VG方法缺乏跨模态推理能力，难以区分文本表达中的细微语义差异，尤其是类别和属性模糊性。

Method: 提出AlignCAT框架，包含粗粒度对齐模块（利用类别信息和全局上下文）和细粒度对齐模块（利用描述性信息和词级文本特征）。

Result: 在RefCOCO、RefCOCO+和RefCOCOg三个基准测试中表现优于现有弱监督方法。

Conclusion: AlignCAT通过充分利用语言线索，逐步过滤未对齐的视觉查询，提升了对比学习效率，解决了VG中的语义模糊问题。

Abstract: Weakly supervised visual grounding (VG) aims to locate objects in images
based on text descriptions. Despite significant progress, existing methods lack
strong cross-modal reasoning to distinguish subtle semantic differences in text
expressions due to category-based and attribute-based ambiguity. To address
these challenges, we introduce AlignCAT, a novel query-based semantic matching
framework for weakly supervised VG. To enhance visual-linguistic alignment, we
propose a coarse-grained alignment module that utilizes category information
and global context, effectively mitigating interference from
category-inconsistent objects. Subsequently, a fine-grained alignment module
leverages descriptive information and captures word-level text features to
achieve attribute consistency. By exploiting linguistic cues to their fullest
extent, our proposed AlignCAT progressively filters out misaligned visual
queries and enhances contrastive learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on
three VG benchmarks, namely RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, verify the
superiority of AlignCAT against existing weakly supervised methods on two VG
tasks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/I2-Multimedia-Lab/AlignCAT.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖视觉语言模型，但图像级预训练与细粒度区域级交互检测不匹配，且文本描述编码困难，限制了模型捕捉详细交互关系的能力。

Method: 提出交互感知提示生成器和语言模型引导的概念校准，动态生成提示并优化概念表示，辅以负采样策略提升模型区分能力。

Result: 在SWIG-HOI和HICO-DET数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: INP-CC通过交互感知提示和概念校准，有效提升了开放词汇人-物交互检测的性能。

Abstract: Open Vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to detect
interactions between humans and objects while generalizing to novel interaction
classes beyond the training set. Current methods often rely on Vision and
Language Models (VLMs) but face challenges due to suboptimal image encoders, as
image-level pre-training does not align well with the fine-grained region-level
interaction detection required for HOI. Additionally, effectively encoding
textual descriptions of visual appearances remains difficult, limiting the
model's ability to capture detailed HOI relationships. To address these issues,
we propose INteraction-aware Prompting with Concept Calibration (INP-CC), an
end-to-end open-vocabulary HOI detector that integrates interaction-aware
prompts and concept calibration. Specifically, we propose an interaction-aware
prompt generator that dynamically generates a compact set of prompts based on
the input scene, enabling selective sharing among similar interactions. This
approach directs the model's attention to key interaction patterns rather than
generic image-level semantics, enhancing HOI detection. Furthermore, we refine
HOI concept representations through language model-guided calibration, which
helps distinguish diverse HOI concepts by investigating visual similarities
across categories. A negative sampling strategy is also employed to improve
inter-modal similarity modeling, enabling the model to better differentiate
visually similar but semantically distinct actions. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that INP-CC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
models on the SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET datasets. Code is available at

TL;DR: GeoShield是一种新型对抗框架，旨在保护地理隐私，通过特征解耦、暴露元素识别和多尺度优化模块，有效防御高级视觉语言模型的地理位置推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型（如GPT-4o）能够从公开图像中推断用户位置，地理隐私面临重大风险。现有对抗扰动方法在高分辨率图像和低扰动预算下表现不佳，且可能引入无关语义内容。

Method: GeoShield包含三个模块：特征解耦模块分离地理和非地理信息，暴露元素识别模块定位图像中的地理暴露区域，尺度自适应增强模块联合优化全局和局部扰动。

Result: 实验表明，GeoShield在黑盒设置下优于现有方法，提供强隐私保护且对视觉或语义质量影响最小。

Conclusion: GeoShield是首个探索对抗扰动防御高级视觉语言模型地理位置推断的工作，为解决日益增长的隐私问题提供了实用有效方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o now demonstrate a remarkable
ability to infer users' locations from public shared images, posing a
substantial risk to geoprivacy. Although adversarial perturbations offer a
potential defense, current methods are ill-suited for this scenario: they often
perform poorly on high-resolution images and low perturbation budgets, and may
introduce irrelevant semantic content. To address these limitations, we propose
GeoShield, a novel adversarial framework designed for robust geoprivacy
protection in real-world scenarios. GeoShield comprises three key modules: a
feature disentanglement module that separates geographical and non-geographical
information, an exposure element identification module that pinpoints
geo-revealing regions within an image, and a scale-adaptive enhancement module
that jointly optimizes perturbations at both global and local levels to ensure
effectiveness across resolutions. Extensive experiments on challenging
benchmarks show that GeoShield consistently surpasses prior methods in
black-box settings, achieving strong privacy protection with minimal impact on
visual or semantic quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first to explore
adversarial perturbations for defending against geolocation inference by
advanced VLMs, providing a practical and effective solution to escalating
privacy concerns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如FreeInit）通过迭代优化噪声实现时间一致性，但计算成本高。FastInit旨在解决这一问题。

Method: FastInit训练了一个视频噪声预测网络（VNPNet），输入随机噪声和文本提示，单次生成优化噪声。

Result: 实验表明，FastInit在多种文本到视频模型中均提升了生成视频的质量和时间一致性。

Conclusion: FastInit为视频生成提供了高效且实用的解决方案，可直接应用于推理阶段。

Abstract: Video generation has made significant strides with the development of
diffusion models; however, achieving high temporal consistency remains a
challenging task. Recently, FreeInit identified a training-inference gap and
introduced a method to iteratively refine the initial noise during inference.
However, iterative refinement significantly increases the computational cost
associated with video generation. In this paper, we introduce FastInit, a fast
noise initialization method that eliminates the need for iterative refinement.
FastInit learns a Video Noise Prediction Network (VNPNet) that takes random
noise and a text prompt as input, generating refined noise in a single forward
pass. Therefore, FastInit greatly enhances the efficiency of video generation
while achieving high temporal consistency across frames. To train the VNPNet,
we create a large-scale dataset consisting of pairs of text prompts, random
noise, and refined noise. Extensive experiments with various text-to-video
models show that our method consistently improves the quality and temporal
consistency of the generated videos. FastInit not only provides a substantial
improvement in video generation but also offers a practical solution that can
be applied directly during inference. The code and dataset will be released.

Motivation: 对抗扰动对深度学习模型构成严重威胁，现有防御方法（如对抗训练）计算成本高且影响标准性能，数据增强方法则效果有限或训练开销大。因此，开发高效且强鲁棒的防御机制至关重要。

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations pose a significant threat to deep learning models.
Adversarial Training (AT), the predominant defense method, faces challenges of
high computational costs and a degradation in standard performance. While data
augmentation offers an alternative path, existing techniques either yield
limited robustness gains or incur substantial training overhead. Therefore,
developing a defense mechanism that is both highly efficient and strongly
robust is of paramount importance.In this work, we first conduct a systematic
analysis of existing augmentation techniques, revealing that the synergy among
diverse strategies -- rather than any single method -- is crucial for enhancing
robustness. Based on this insight, we propose the Universal Adversarial
Augmenter (UAA) framework, which is characterized by its plug-and-play nature
and training efficiency. UAA decouples the expensive perturbation generation
process from model training by pre-computing a universal transformation
offline, which is then used to efficiently generate unique adversarial
perturbations for each sample during training.Extensive experiments conducted
on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of UAA. The results
demonstrate that UAA establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for
data-augmentation-based adversarial defense strategies , without requiring the
online generation of adversarial examples during training. This framework
provides a practical and efficient pathway for building robust models,Our code

Abstract: Language-instructed robot manipulation has garnered significant interest due
to the potential of learning from collected data. While the challenges in
high-level perception and planning are continually addressed along the progress
of general large pre-trained models, the low precision of low-level action
estimation has emerged as the key limiting factor in manipulation performance.
To this end, this paper introduces a novel robot manipulation framework, i.e.,
ActionSink, to pave the way toward precise action estimations in the field of
learning-based robot manipulation. As the name suggests, ActionSink
reformulates the actions of robots as action-caused optical flows from videos,
called "action flow", in a self-supervised manner, which are then used to be
retrieved and integrated to enhance the action estimation. Specifically,
ActionSink incorporates two primary modules. The first module is a
coarse-to-fine action flow matcher, which continuously refines the accuracy of
action flow via iterative retrieval and denoising process. The second module is
a dynamic action flow integrator, which employs a working memory pool that
dynamically and efficiently manages the historical action flows that should be
used to integrate to enhance the current action estimation. In this module, a
multi-layer fusion module is proposed to integrate direct estimation and action
flows from both the current and the working memory, achieving highly accurate
action estimation through a series of estimation-integration processes. Our
ActionSink framework outperformed prior SOTA on the LIBERO benchmark by a 7.9\%
success rate, and obtained nearly an 8\% accuracy gain on the challenging
long-horizon visual task LIBERO-Long.

Conclusion: GIT有效解决了2D到3D分割中的一致性问题，生成更清晰的分割边界和3D资产。

Abstract: We address the challenge of lifting 2D visual segmentation to 3D in Gaussian
Splatting. Existing methods often suffer from inconsistent 2D masks across
viewpoints and produce noisy segmentation boundaries as they neglect these
semantic cues to refine the learned Gaussians. To overcome this, we introduce
Gaussian Instance Tracing (GIT), which augments the standard Gaussian
representation with an instance weight matrix across input views. Leveraging
the inherent consistency of Gaussians in 3D, we use this matrix to identify and
correct 2D segmentation inconsistencies. Furthermore, since each Gaussian
ideally corresponds to a single object, we propose a GIT-guided adaptive
density control mechanism to split and prune ambiguous Gaussians during
training, resulting in sharper and more coherent 2D and 3D segmentation
boundaries. Experimental results show that our method extracts clean 3D assets
and consistently improves 3D segmentation in both online (e.g., self-prompting)
and offline (e.g., contrastive lifting) settings, enabling applications such as
hierarchical segmentation, object extraction, and scene editing.

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images is critical for ensuring product
quality in nanomaterial synthesis and accelerating development. However,
conventional deep learning methods for shape classification require extensive
labeled datasets and computationally demanding training, limiting their
accessibility to the typical nanoparticle practitioner in research and
industrial settings. In this study, we introduce a zero-shot classification
pipeline that leverages two vision foundation models: the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) for object segmentation and DINOv2 for feature embedding. By
combining these models with a lightweight classifier, we achieve high-precision
shape classification across three morphologically diverse nanoparticle datasets
- without the need for extensive parameter fine-tuning. Our methodology
outperforms a fine-tuned YOLOv11 and ChatGPT o4-mini-high baselines,
demonstrating robustness to small datasets, subtle morphological variations,
and domain shifts from natural to scientific imaging. Quantitative clustering
metrics on PCA plots of the DINOv2 features are discussed as a means of
assessing the progress of the chemical synthesis. This work highlights the
potential of foundation models to advance automated microscopy image analysis,
offering an alternative to traditional deep learning pipelines in nanoparticle
research which is both more efficient and more accessible to the user.

*Xingchao Yang,Shiori Ueda,Yuantian Huang,Tomoya Akiyama,Takafumi Taketomi*

TL;DR: 论文提出了FFHQ-Makeup数据集，解决了高质量配对化妆数据集稀缺的问题，通过改进的化妆转移方法生成18K身份的90K配对图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有化妆数据集采集困难，合成方法存在失真或一致性不足的问题，需要高质量配对数据集支持美容相关任务。

Method: 基于FFHQ数据集，改进化妆转移方法，分离身份与化妆风格，为每个身份生成5种化妆风格的配对图像。

Result: 构建了包含90K高质量配对图像的FFHQ-Makeup数据集，保持身份和表情一致性。

Conclusion: FFHQ-Makeup填补了高质量配对化妆数据集的空白，为美容相关研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Paired bare-makeup facial images are essential for a wide range of
beauty-related tasks, such as virtual try-on, facial privacy protection, and
facial aesthetics analysis. However, collecting high-quality paired makeup
datasets remains a significant challenge. Real-world data acquisition is
constrained by the difficulty of collecting large-scale paired images, while
existing synthetic approaches often suffer from limited realism or
inconsistencies between bare and makeup images. Current synthetic methods
typically fall into two categories: warping-based transformations, which often
distort facial geometry and compromise the precision of makeup; and
text-to-image generation, which tends to alter facial identity and expression,
undermining consistency. In this work, we present FFHQ-Makeup, a high-quality
synthetic makeup dataset that pairs each identity with multiple makeup styles
while preserving facial consistency in both identity and expression. Built upon
the diverse FFHQ dataset, our pipeline transfers real-world makeup styles from
existing datasets onto 18K identities by introducing an improved makeup
transfer method that disentangles identity and makeup. Each identity is paired
with 5 different makeup styles, resulting in a total of 90K high-quality
bare-makeup image pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work
that focuses specifically on constructing a makeup dataset. We hope that
FFHQ-Makeup fills the gap of lacking high-quality bare-makeup paired datasets
and serves as a valuable resource for future research in beauty-related tasks.

*Lukas Ranftl,Felix Brendel,Bertram Drost,Carsten Steger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVTOP是一种基于Transformer的多视角刚性物体姿态估计方法，通过早期融合视角特征解决单视角无法处理的姿态模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单视角或后处理单视角姿态无法解决的姿态模糊问题，提出一种多视角几何建模方法。

Method: 利用视线从相机中心出发的多视角几何建模，假设相机内部和相对方向已知但可变化，通过融合多视角信息预测正确姿态。

Result: 在合成数据集上优于单视角和其他多视角方法，在YCB-V数据集上表现竞争性。

Conclusion: MVTOP是首个能可靠解决姿态模糊问题的端到端可训练多视角方法，无需额外数据如深度信息。

Abstract: We present MVTOP, a novel transformer-based method for multi-view rigid
object pose estimation. Through an early fusion of the view-specific features,
our method can resolve pose ambiguities that would be impossible to solve with
a single view or with a post-processing of single-view poses. MVTOP models the
multi-view geometry via lines of sight that emanate from the respective camera
centers. While the method assumes the camera interior and relative orientations
are known for a particular scene, they can vary for each inference. This makes
the method versatile. The use of the lines of sight enables MVTOP to correctly
predict the correct pose with the merged multi-view information. To show the
model's capabilities, we provide a synthetic data set that can only be solved
with such holistic multi-view approaches since the poses in the dataset cannot
be solved with just one view. Our method outperforms single-view and all
existing multi-view approaches on our dataset and achieves competitive results
on the YCB-V dataset. To the best of our knowledge, no holistic multi-view
method exists that can resolve such pose ambiguities reliably. Our model is
end-to-end trainable and does not require any additional data, e.g., depth.

Motivation: 事件相机的高时间分辨率、低延迟和高动态范围优势受限于其低空间分辨率，难以满足细粒度感知任务需求。

Method: 采用SNN设计实时事件超分辨率方法，引入双向前极性分割事件编码策略和可学习时空极性感知损失（LearnSTPLoss）。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现竞争性超分辨率性能，同时显著减少模型大小和推理时间。

Conclusion: 轻量级设计使其可嵌入事件相机或作为下游视觉任务的高效前端预处理模块。

Abstract: Event cameras offer unparalleled advantages such as high temporal resolution,
low latency, and high dynamic range. However, their limited spatial resolution
poses challenges for fine-grained perception tasks. In this work, we propose an
ultra-lightweight, stream-based event-to-event super-resolution method based on
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), designed for real-time deployment on
resource-constrained devices. To further reduce model size, we introduce a
novel Dual-Forward Polarity-Split Event Encoding strategy that decouples
positive and negative events into separate forward paths through a shared SNN.
Furthermore, we propose a Learnable Spatio-temporal Polarity-aware Loss
(LearnSTPLoss) that adaptively balances temporal, spatial, and polarity
consistency using learnable uncertainty-based weights. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive super-resolution performance
on multiple datasets while significantly reducing model size and inference
time. The lightweight design enables embedding the module into event cameras or
using it as an efficient front-end preprocessing for downstream vision tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对视觉语言模型（VLM）的重要性感知后训练量化框架VLMQ，解决了现有方法在VLM上性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Hessian的LLM后训练量化方法在VLM上表现不佳，主要因为模态差异（文本标记有限而视觉标记冗余）。

Method: VLMQ通过优化重要性感知目标，生成增强的Hessian矩阵，并利用轻量级块级反向传播计算重要性因子。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，VLMQ在低比特量化下表现优异，例如在2比特量化下MME-RealWorld任务提升16.45%。

Conclusion: VLMQ为VLM的后训练量化提供了高效且有效的解决方案，尤其在低比特设置下表现突出。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as an effective approach for
compressing large models and accelerating their inference without retraining.
While PTQ has been extensively studied in the context of large language models
(LLMs), its applicability to vision-language models (VLMs) remains
underexplored. In this paper, we identify a modality discrepancy (\emph{i.e.},
limited text tokens \emph{vs.} excessive and redundant vision tokens) of VLMs.
However, existing Hessian-based LLM PTQ methods treat all tokens equally during
quantization, resulting in severe performance drops when applied to VLMs.
Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel importance-aware PTQ
framework tailored for VLMs, dubbed VLMQ. Specifically, to address vision token
redundancy, VLMQ 1) optimizes an importance-aware objective that yields an
enhanced Hessian with token-level importance factors, while retaining
compatibility with parallelized weight updates, and 2) ensures efficiency and
effectiveness by computing these factors via a single lightweight block-wise
backward pass, guided by a theoretical connection to token-level perturbations.
Extensive evaluations on 8 benchmarks across 0.5B$\sim$32B VLMs demonstrate the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our VLMQ, particularly under low-bit
settings. For example, it achieves a substantial \textbf{16.45\%} improvement
on MME-RealWorld under 2-bit quantization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖多步迭代或预训练扩散先验，效率较低，RSDNet旨在解决这一问题。

Method: RSDNet利用多级去噪自编码器（DAEs）在潜在特征空间学习去噪过程，并引入语义几何条件指导以增强稀疏表示。

Result: 在公开基准测试中，RSDNet表现优于现有方法，达到最先进的检测性能。

Conclusion: RSDNet通过单步检测和鲁棒设计，显著提升了3D目标检测的效率和性能。

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have shown success in robust
3D object detection tasks. Existing methods often rely on the score matching
from 3D boxes or pre-trained diffusion priors. However, they typically require
multi-step iterations in inference, which limits efficiency. To address this,
we propose a \textbf{R}obust single-stage fully \textbf{S}parse 3D object
\textbf{D}etection \textbf{Net}work with a Detachable Latent Framework (DLF) of
DDPMs, named RSDNet. Specifically, RSDNet learns the denoising process in
latent feature spaces through lightweight denoising networks like multi-level
denoising autoencoders (DAEs). This enables RSDNet to effectively understand
scene distributions under multi-level perturbations, achieving robust and
reliable detection. Meanwhile, we reformulate the noising and denoising
mechanisms of DDPMs, enabling DLF to construct multi-type and multi-level noise
samples and targets, enhancing RSDNet robustness to multiple perturbations.
Furthermore, a semantic-geometric conditional guidance is introduced to
perceive the object boundaries and shapes, alleviating the center feature
missing problem in sparse representations, enabling RSDNet to perform in a
fully sparse detection pipeline. Moreover, the detachable denoising network
design of DLF enables RSDNet to perform single-step detection in inference,
further enhancing detection efficiency. Extensive experiments on public
benchmarks show that RSDNet can outperform existing methods, achieving
state-of-the-art detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有蒸馏方法主要依赖监督微调（SFT），容易导致模式崩溃，尤其是在剪枝模型容量减少时，无法直接匹配教师模型的输出，从而降低生成质量。

Method: 提出ReDPO方法，结合DPO和SFT，利用DPO指导学生模型专注于恢复目标属性而非被动模仿教师模型，同时使用SFT提升整体性能。此外，提出V.I.P.框架用于高质量数据集筛选和校准训练。

Result: 在VideoCrafter2和AnimateDiff模型上验证，分别减少36.2%和67.5%的参数，同时保持或超越完整模型的性能。

Conclusion: ReDPO和V.I.P.框架能够实现高效且高质量的视频生成，为资源受限环境下的文本到视频模型部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With growing interest in deploying text-to-video (T2V) models in
resource-constrained environments, reducing their high computational cost has
become crucial, leading to extensive research on pruning and knowledge
distillation methods while maintaining performance. However, existing
distillation methods primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which
often leads to mode collapse as pruned models with reduced capacity fail to
directly match the teacher's outputs, ultimately resulting in degraded quality.
To address this challenge, we propose an effective distillation method, ReDPO,
that integrates DPO and SFT. Our approach leverages DPO to guide the student
model to focus on recovering only the targeted properties, rather than
passively imitating the teacher, while also utilizing SFT to enhance overall
performance. We additionally propose V.I.P., a novel framework for filtering
and curating high-quality pair datasets, along with a step-by-step online
approach for calibrated training. We validate our method on two leading T2V
models, VideoCrafter2 and AnimateDiff, achieving parameter reduction of 36.2%
and 67.5% each, while maintaining or even surpassing the performance of full
models. Further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both ReDPO and
V.I.P. framework in enabling efficient and high-quality video generation. Our

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要依赖提示级建模，由于T2I模型的输入令牌容量有限，导致个性化不准确。

Method: DrUM结合用户画像和基于变压器的适配器，在潜在空间中进行条件级建模。

Result: DrUM在大规模数据集上表现优异，并能与开源文本编码器无缝集成。

Conclusion: DrUM无需额外微调即可与主流T2I模型兼容，提供更准确的个性化生成。

Abstract: Personalized generation in T2I diffusion models aims to naturally incorporate
individual user preferences into the generation process with minimal user
intervention. However, existing studies primarily rely on prompt-level modeling
with large-scale models, often leading to inaccurate personalization due to the
limited input token capacity of T2I diffusion models. To address these
limitations, we propose DrUM, a novel method that integrates user profiling
with a transformer-based adapter to enable personalized generation through
condition-level modeling in the latent space. DrUM demonstrates strong
performance on large-scale datasets and seamlessly integrates with open-source
text encoders, making it compatible with widely used foundation T2I models
without requiring additional fine-tuning.

TL;DR: DiffBrush是一种基于扩散的模型，用于生成手写文本行，通过内容解耦风格学习和多尺度内容学习，解决了风格模仿和内容准确性的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手写文本生成方法主要关注孤立单词，而实际手写文本需要关注单词间关系（如垂直对齐和水平间距），因此生成整行文本更具挑战性和实用性。

Method: DiffBrush采用内容解耦风格学习（通过列和行掩码分离风格与内容）和多尺度内容学习（使用行和单词判别器确保全局一致性和局部准确性）。

Result: 实验表明，DiffBrush在生成高质量文本行方面表现优异，尤其在风格再现和内容保留方面。

Conclusion: DiffBrush为手写文本行生成提供了一种有效方法，解决了风格和内容建模的复杂问题。

Abstract: Existing handwritten text generation methods primarily focus on isolated
words. However, realistic handwritten text demands attention not only to
individual words but also to the relationships between them, such as vertical
alignment and horizontal spacing. Therefore, generating entire text lines
emerges as a more promising and comprehensive task. However, this task poses
significant challenges, including the accurate modeling of complex style
patterns encompassing both intra- and inter-word relationships, and maintaining
content accuracy across numerous characters. To address these challenges, we
propose DiffBrush, a novel diffusion-based model for handwritten text-line
generation. Unlike existing methods, DiffBrush excels in both style imitation
and content accuracy through two key strategies: (1) content-decoupled style
learning, which disentangles style from content to better capture intra-word
and inter-word style patterns by using column- and row-wise masking; and (2)
multi-scale content learning, which employs line and word discriminators to
ensure global coherence and local accuracy of textual content. Extensive
experiments show that DiffBrush excels in generating high-quality text lines,
particularly in style reproduction and content preservation. Code is available

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将第一人称动作识别中的动词和名词组件视为独立任务，忽略了它们的语义和上下文关系，导致表示碎片化和泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出EgoPrompt框架，构建统一提示池空间，通过提示对形式分解组件表示，并利用注意力机制融合模式级表示，同时引入多样化池标准训练目标。

Result: 在Ego4D、EPIC-Kitchens和EGTEA数据集上的实验表明，EgoPrompt在跨数据集和基到新泛化基准上均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: EgoPrompt通过统一提示池和注意力机制有效捕捉了组件间关系，显著提升了动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Driven by the increasing demand for applications in augmented and virtual
reality, egocentric action recognition has emerged as a prominent research
area. It is typically divided into two subtasks: recognizing the performed
behavior (i.e., verb component) and identifying the objects being acted upon
(i.e., noun component) from the first-person perspective. However, most
existing approaches treat these two components as independent classification
tasks, focusing on extracting component-specific knowledge while overlooking
their inherent semantic and contextual relationships, leading to fragmented
representations and sub-optimal generalization capability. To address these
challenges, we propose a prompt learning-based framework, EgoPrompt, to conduct
the egocentric action recognition task. Building on the existing prompting
strategy to capture the component-specific knowledge, we construct a Unified
Prompt Pool space to establish interaction between the two types of component
representations. Specifically, the component representations (from verbs and
nouns) are first decomposed into fine-grained patterns with the prompt pair
form. Then, these pattern-level representations are fused through an
attention-based mechanism to facilitate cross-component interaction. To ensure
the prompt pool is informative, we further introduce a novel training
objective, Diverse Pool Criteria. This objective realizes our goals from two
perspectives: Prompt Selection Frequency Regularization and Prompt Knowledge
Orthogonalization. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Ego4D,
EPIC-Kitchens, and EGTEA datasets. The results consistently show that EgoPrompt
achieves state-of-the-art performance across within-dataset, cross-dataset, and
base-to-novel generalization benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of placental diseases via whole slide images (WSIs) is
critical for preventing severe maternal and fetal complications. However, WSI
analysis presents significant computational challenges due to the massive data
volume. Existing WSI classification methods encounter critical limitations: (1)
inadequate patch selection strategies that either compromise performance or
fail to sufficiently reduce computational demands, and (2) the loss of global
histological context resulting from patch-level processing approaches. To
address these challenges, we propose an Efficient multimodal framework for
Patient-level placental disease Diagnosis, named EmmPD. Our approach introduces
a two-stage patch selection module that combines parameter-free and learnable
compression strategies, optimally balancing computational efficiency with
critical feature preservation. Additionally, we develop a hybrid multimodal
fusion module that leverages adaptive graph learning to enhance pathological
feature representation and incorporates textual medical reports to enrich
global contextual understanding. Extensive experiments conducted on both a
self-constructed patient-level Placental dataset and two public datasets
demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance.

Conclusion: 准确匹配模因的共享视觉元素（不仅是背景模板）仍是一个开放挑战，需要更复杂的匹配技术。

Abstract: Internet memes, now a staple of digital communication, play a pivotal role in
how users engage within online communities and allow researchers to gain
insight into contemporary digital culture. These engaging user-generated
content are characterised by their reuse of visual elements also found in other
memes. Matching instances of memes via these shared visual elements, called
Meme Matching, is the basis of a wealth of meme analysis approaches. However,
most existing methods assume that every meme consists of a shared visual
background, called a Template, with some overlaid text, thereby limiting meme
matching to comparing the background image alone. Current approaches exclude
the many memes that are not template-based and limit the effectiveness of
automated meme analysis and would not be effective at linking memes to
contemporary web-based meme dictionaries. In this work, we introduce a broader
formulation of meme matching that extends beyond template matching. We show
that conventional similarity measures, including a novel segment-wise
computation of the similarity measures, excel at matching template-based memes
but fall short when applied to non-template-based meme formats. However, the
segment-wise approach was found to consistently outperform the whole-image
measures on matching non-template-based memes. Finally, we explore a
prompting-based approach using a pretrained Multimodal Large Language Model for
meme matching. Our results highlight that accurately matching memes via shared
visual elements, not just background templates, remains an open challenge that
requires more sophisticated matching techniques.

Conclusion: SDGPA通过合成数据和渐进适应策略有效解决了零样本域自适应问题。

Abstract: Deep learning-based semantic segmentation models achieve impressive results
yet remain limited in handling distribution shifts between training and test
data. In this paper, we present SDGPA (Synthetic Data Generation and
Progressive Adaptation), a novel method that tackles zero-shot domain adaptive
semantic segmentation, in which no target images are available, but only a text
description of the target domain's style is provided. To compensate for the
lack of target domain training data, we utilize a pretrained off-the-shelf
text-to-image diffusion model, which generates training images by transferring
source domain images to target style. Directly editing source domain images
introduces noise that harms segmentation because the layout of source images
cannot be precisely maintained. To address inaccurate layouts in synthetic
data, we propose a method that crops the source image, edits small patches
individually, and then merges them back together, which helps improve spatial
precision. Recognizing the large domain gap, SDGPA constructs an augmented
intermediate domain, leveraging easier adaptation subtasks to enable more
stable model adaptation to the target domain. Additionally, to mitigate the
impact of noise in synthetic data, we design a progressive adaptation strategy,
ensuring robust learning throughout the training process. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot
semantic segmentation. The code is available at

Result: 在公共基准数据集和真实场景中，BaroPoser优于仅使用IMU的现有方法。

Conclusion: BaroPoser通过融合气压计数据显著提升了非平坦地形下的人体运动估计性能。

Abstract: In recent years, tracking human motion using IMUs from everyday devices such
as smartphones and smartwatches has gained increasing popularity. However, due
to the sparsity of sensor measurements and the lack of datasets capturing human
motion over uneven terrain, existing methods often struggle with pose
estimation accuracy and are typically limited to recovering movements on flat
terrain only. To this end, we present BaroPoser, the first method that combines
IMU and barometric data recorded by a smartphone and a smartwatch to estimate
human pose and global translation in real time. By leveraging barometric
readings, we estimate sensor height changes, which provide valuable cues for
both improving the accuracy of human pose estimation and predicting global
translation on non-flat terrain. Furthermore, we propose a local thigh
coordinate frame to disentangle local and global motion input for better pose
representation learning. We evaluate our method on both public benchmark
datasets and real-world recordings. Quantitative and qualitative results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods
that use IMUs only with the same hardware configuration.

Abstract: Object detection has achieved remarkable accuracy through deep learning, yet
these improvements often come with increased computational cost, limiting
deployment on resource-constrained devices. Knowledge Distillation (KD)
provides an effective solution by enabling compact student models to learn from
larger teacher models. However, adapting KD to object detection poses unique
challenges due to its dual objectives-classification and localization-as well
as foreground-background imbalance and multi-scale feature representation. This
review introduces a novel architecture-centric taxonomy for KD methods,
distinguishing between CNN-based detectors (covering backbone-level,
neck-level, head-level, and RPN/RoI-level distillation) and Transformer-based

We further evaluate representative methods using the MS COCO and PASCAL VOC

of their effectiveness. The proposed taxonomy and analysis aim to clarify the
evolving landscape of KD in object detection, highlight current challenges, and

Method: 结合24 GHz多普勒雷达前端和神经形态采样器，通过异步sigma-delta编码将信号转换为稀疏的基于脉冲的表示，并由轻量级神经网络处理。

Result: 在七名用户的五种手势数据集上，系统实现了>85%的实时准确率。

Conclusion: 该框架首次将生物启发的异步sigma-delta编码和事件驱动处理用于雷达手势识别，显著降低了功耗和计算开销。

Abstract: We present a neuromorphic radar framework for real-time, low-power hand
gesture recognition (HGR) using an event-driven architecture inspired by
biological sensing. Our system comprises a 24 GHz Doppler radar front-end and a
custom neuromorphic sampler that converts intermediate-frequency (IF) signals
into sparse spike-based representations via asynchronous sigma-delta encoding.
These events are directly processed by a lightweight neural network deployed on
a Cortex-M0 microcontroller, enabling low-latency inference without requiring
spectrogram reconstruction. Unlike conventional radar HGR pipelines that
continuously sample and process data, our architecture activates only when
meaningful motion is detected, significantly reducing memory, power, and
computation overhead. Evaluated on a dataset of five gestures collected from
seven users, our system achieves > 85% real-time accuracy. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that employs bio-inspired asynchronous
sigma-delta encoding and an event-driven processing framework for radar-based
HGR.

Abstract: The exponential growth in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) usage underscores
the critical need of detecting them at extended distances to ensure safe

advances made in computer vision through deep learning, the detection of these
small airborne objects remains a formidable challenge. While several datasets
have been developed specifically for drone detection, the need for a more

long-range detection under varying environmental conditions. We introduce here
the Long Range Drone Detection (LRDD) Version 2 dataset, comprising 39,516
meticulously annotated images, as a second release of the LRDD dataset released
previously. The LRDDv2 dataset enhances the LRDDv1 by incorporating a greater
variety of images, providing a more diverse and comprehensive resource for

range information for over 8,000 images, making it possible to develop
algorithms for drone range estimation. Tailored for long-range aerial object
detection, the majority of LRDDv2's dataset consists of images capturing drones

Motivation: 自回归扩散模型在长视频生成中存在时间漂移和并行化限制，影响了生成质量和效率。

Method: 采用两阶段规划（微观和宏观规划）生成全局故事线，并通过并行填充中间帧实现高效生成。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在质量和稳定性上优于现有长视频生成模型。

Conclusion: MMPL框架有效解决了长视频生成中的时间一致性和并行化问题。

Abstract: Current autoregressive diffusion models excel at video generation but are
generally limited to short temporal durations. Our theoretical analysis
indicates that the autoregressive modeling typically suffers from temporal
drift caused by error accumulation and hinders parallelization in long video
synthesis. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
planning-then-populating framework centered on Macro-from-Micro Planning (MMPL)
for long video generation. MMPL sketches a global storyline for the entire
video through two hierarchical stages: Micro Planning and Macro Planning.
Specifically, Micro Planning predicts a sparse set of future keyframes within
each short video segment, offering motion and appearance priors to guide
high-quality video segment generation. Macro Planning extends the in-segment
keyframes planning across the entire video through an autoregressive chain of
micro plans, ensuring long-term consistency across video segments.
Subsequently, MMPL-based Content Populating generates all intermediate frames
in parallel across segments, enabling efficient parallelization of
autoregressive generation. The parallelization is further optimized by Adaptive
Workload Scheduling for balanced GPU execution and accelerated autoregressive
video generation. Extensive experiments confirm that our method outperforms
existing long video generation models in quality and stability. Generated
videos and comparison results are in our project page.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种双阶段方法，用于恢复极暗图像中的细节，包括频率域全局光照恢复和纹理结构细化模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在恢复暗图像细节时效果有限，无法保留精细细节和锐利边缘，影响下游应用。

Method: 第一阶段使用残差傅里叶引导模块（RFGM）恢复全局光照；第二阶段通过Patch Mamba和Grad Mamba模块细化纹理结构。

Result: 在多个基准数据集和下游应用中显著提升细节恢复性能，且模块轻量高效。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了暗图像细节恢复问题，模块易于集成且计算开销低。

Abstract: Recovering fine-grained details in extremely dark images remains challenging
due to severe structural information loss and noise corruption. Existing
enhancement methods often fail to preserve intricate details and sharp edges,
limiting their effectiveness in downstream applications like text and edge
detection. To address these deficiencies, we propose an efficient dual-stage
approach centered on detail recovery for dark images. In the first stage, we
introduce a Residual Fourier-Guided Module (RFGM) that effectively restores
global illumination in the frequency domain. RFGM captures inter-stage and
inter-channel dependencies through residual connections, providing robust
priors for high-fidelity frequency processing while mitigating error
accumulation risks from unreliable priors. The second stage employs
complementary Mamba modules specifically designed for textural structure
refinement: (1) Patch Mamba operates on channel-concatenated non-downsampled
patches, meticulously modeling pixel-level correlations to enhance fine-grained
details without resolution loss. (2) Grad Mamba explicitly focuses on
high-gradient regions, alleviating state decay in state space models and
prioritizing reconstruction of sharp edges and boundaries. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and downstream applications
demonstrate that our method significantly improves detail recovery performance
while maintaining efficiency. Crucially, the proposed modules are lightweight
and can be seamlessly integrated into existing Fourier-based frameworks with
minimal computational overhead. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视频问答中因高标记成本受限，现有方法存在帧数过多导致性能下降和视觉冗余问题。

Method: 提出AFP方法，结合自适应层次聚类和轻量级语义图，剪枝并合并冗余帧。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，帧数减少86.9%，输入标记减少83.2%，且性能优于基线。

Conclusion: AFP方法高效且能提升准确性，为视频问答提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The practical application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to
Video Question Answering (Video-QA) is severely hindered by the high token cost
of processing numerous video frames. While increasing the number of sampled
frames is a common strategy, we observe a "less is more" phenomenon where
excessive frames can paradoxically degrade performance due to context dilution.
Concurrently, state-of-the-art keyframe selection methods, while effective,
still yield significant temporal redundancy, which we term 'visual echoes'. To
address these dual challenges, we propose Adaptive Frame-Pruning (AFP), a novel
post-processing method that intelligently prunes the selected keyframes. AFP
employs an adaptive hierarchical clustering algorithm on a fused ResNet-50 and
CLIP feature space to identify and merge these echoes into single
representatives. To compensate for information loss, we then introduce a
lightweight, text-based semantic graph that provides critical context with
minimal token overhead. Conducting extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench
and VideoMME benchmarks across multiple leading MLLMs, our full approach
demonstrates a drastic reduction in required frames by up to 86.9% and total
input tokens by up to 83.2%. Crucially, by providing a concise, high-quality
set of frames, our method not only enhances efficiency but often improves
accuracy over baselines that use more frames. The code will be released upon
publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夜间图像可见性差，现有方法缺乏解释性或依赖不可靠先验，物理方法假设简化，难以应对复杂场景。

Method: 利用向量量化（VQ）学习离散视觉标记，通过多级因果干预（PCI、FCI、LSAG）校正分布偏移，解码时使用HDRM重建细节。

Result: 通过因果干预和离散表示学习，显著提升低光图像增强效果。

Conclusion: CIVQLLIE框架结合离散表示和因果干预，有效解决低光图像增强问题。

Abstract: Images captured in nighttime scenes suffer from severely reduced visibility,
hindering effective content perception. Current low-light image enhancement
(LLIE) methods face significant challenges: data-driven end-to-end mapping
networks lack interpretability or rely on unreliable prior guidance, struggling
under extremely dark conditions, while physics-based methods depend on
simplified assumptions that often fail in complex real-world scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose CIVQLLIE, a novel framework that
leverages the power of discrete representation learning through causal
reasoning. We achieve this through Vector Quantization (VQ), which maps
continuous image features to a discrete codebook of visual tokens learned from
large-scale high-quality images. This codebook serves as a reliable prior,
encoding standardized brightness and color patterns that are independent of
degradation. However, direct application of VQ to low-light images fails due to
distribution shifts between degraded inputs and the learned codebook.
Therefore, we propose a multi-level causal intervention approach to
systematically correct these shifts. First, during encoding, our Pixel-level
Causal Intervention (PCI) module intervenes to align low-level features with
the brightness and color distributions expected by the codebook. Second, a
Feature-aware Causal Intervention (FCI) mechanism with Low-frequency Selective
Attention Gating (LSAG) identifies and enhances channels most affected by
illumination degradation, facilitating accurate codebook token matching while
enhancing the encoder's generalization performance through flexible
feature-level intervention. Finally, during decoding, the High-frequency Detail
Reconstruction Module (HDRM) leverages structural information preserved in the
matched codebook representations to reconstruct fine details using deformable
convolution techniques.

TL;DR: WaMo是一种基于小波的多频率特征提取框架，用于改进文本与3D运动序列的语义对齐，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理3D运动与文本匹配时，未能充分捕捉人体各部分的动态细节，导致语义对齐不精确。

Method: WaMo通过轨迹小波分解、轨迹小波重构和乱序运动序列预测三个关键组件，提取多分辨率运动特征以实现细粒度对齐。

Result: 在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上，WaMo的Rsum分别提升了17.0%和18.2%，优于现有SOTA方法。

Conclusion: WaMo通过多频率特征提取和时空信息保留，显著提升了文本与3D运动序列的语义对齐性能。

Abstract: Text-Motion Retrieval (TMR) aims to retrieve 3D motion sequences semantically
relevant to text descriptions. However, matching 3D motions with text remains
highly challenging, primarily due to the intricate structure of human body and
its spatial-temporal dynamics. Existing approaches often overlook these
complexities, relying on general encoding methods that fail to distinguish
different body parts and their dynamics, limiting precise semantic alignment.
To address this, we propose WaMo, a novel wavelet-based multi-frequency feature
extraction framework. It fully captures part-specific and time-varying motion
details across multiple resolutions on body joints, extracting discriminative
motion features to achieve fine-grained alignment with texts. WaMo has three
key components: (1) Trajectory Wavelet Decomposition decomposes motion signals
into frequency components that preserve both local kinematic details and global
motion semantics. (2) Trajectory Wavelet Reconstruction uses learnable inverse
wavelet transforms to reconstruct original joint trajectories from extracted
features, ensuring the preservation of essential spatial-temporal information.
(3) Disordered Motion Sequence Prediction reorders shuffled motion sequences to
improve the learning of inherent temporal coherence, enhancing motion-text
alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate WaMo's superiority, achieving
17.0\% and 18.2\% improvements in $Rsum$ on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets,
respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Motivation: 传统联邦学习方法在模型规模增大时需要大量客户端计算资源，而FedPromo旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：服务器端知识蒸馏对齐大模型与紧凑模型表示，客户端训练分类器并聚合回大模型。

Result: 在五个图像分类基准测试中，FedPromo优于现有方法，适用于资源有限的客户端。

Conclusion: FedPromo在性能、隐私和资源效率之间取得了平衡，适用于多领域学习。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an established paradigm for training deep learning
models on decentralized data. However, as the size of the models grows,
conventional FL approaches often require significant computational resources on
client devices, which may not be feasible. We introduce FedPromo, a novel
framework that enables efficient adaptation of large-scale foundation models
stored on a central server to new domains encountered only by remote clients.
Instead of directly training the large model on client devices, FedPromo
optimizes lightweight proxy models via FL, significantly reducing computational
overhead while maintaining privacy. Our method follows a two-stage process:
first, server-side knowledge distillation aligns the representations of a
large-scale foundation model (e.g., a transformer) with those of a compact
counterpart (e.g., a CNN). Then, the compact model encoder is deployed to
client devices, where trainable classifiers are learned locally. These
classifiers are subsequently aggregated and seamlessly transferred back to the
foundation model, facilitating personalized adaptation without requiring direct
access to user data. Through novel regularization strategies, our framework
enables decentralized multi-domain learning, balancing performance, privacy,
and resource efficiency. Extensive experiments on five image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that FedPromo outperforms existing methods while
assuming limited-resource clients.

Result: 实验表明，DOD在视觉质量和推理效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DOD是一种高效且适应性强的图像修复方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have revealed powerful potential in all-in-one image
restoration (AiOIR), which is talented in generating abundant texture details.
The existing AiOIR methods either retrain a diffusion model or fine-tune the
pretrained diffusion model with extra conditional guidance. However, they often
suffer from high inference costs and limited adaptability to diverse
degradation types. In this paper, we propose an efficient AiOIR method,
Diffusion Once and Done (DOD), which aims to achieve superior restoration
performance with only one-step sampling of Stable Diffusion (SD) models.
Specifically, multi-degradation feature modulation is first introduced to
capture different degradation prompts with a pretrained diffusion model. Then,
parameter-efficient conditional low-rank adaptation integrates the prompts to
enable the fine-tuning of the SD model for adapting to different degradation
types. Besides, a high-fidelity detail enhancement module is integrated into
the decoder of SD to improve structural and textural details. Experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing diffusion-based restoration
approaches in both visual quality and inference efficiency.

Conclusion: GRASP有效整合解剖学背景，提升病理分割性能。

Abstract: Radiologists rely on anatomical understanding to accurately delineate
pathologies, yet most current deep learning approaches use pure pattern
recognition and ignore the anatomical context in which pathologies develop. To
narrow this gap, we introduce GRASP (Guided Representation Alignment for the
Segmentation of Pathologies), a modular plug-and-play framework that enhances
pathology segmentation models by leveraging existing anatomy segmentation
models through pseudolabel integration and feature alignment. Unlike previous
approaches that obtain anatomical knowledge via auxiliary training, GRASP
integrates into standard pathology optimization regimes without retraining
anatomical components. We evaluate GRASP on two PET/CT datasets, conduct
systematic ablation studies, and investigate the framework's inner workings. We
find that GRASP consistently achieves top rankings across multiple evaluation
metrics and diverse architectures. The framework's dual anatomy injection
strategy, combining anatomical pseudo-labels as input channels with
transformer-guided anatomical feature fusion, effectively incorporates
anatomical context.

Result: 实验表明GaitAdapter能有效保留多任务知识，显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: GaitAdapter为持续步态识别提供了高效解决方案，提升了模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Current gait recognition methodologies generally necessitate retraining when
encountering new datasets. Nevertheless, retrained models frequently encounter
difficulties in preserving knowledge from previous datasets, leading to a
significant decline in performance on earlier test sets. To tackle these
challenges, we present a continual gait recognition task, termed GaitAdapt,
which supports the progressive enhancement of gait recognition capabilities
over time and is systematically categorized according to various evaluation
scenarios. Additionally, we propose GaitAdapter, a non-replay continual
learning approach for gait recognition. This approach integrates the
GaitPartition Adaptive Knowledge (GPAK) module, employing graph neural networks
to aggregate common gait patterns from current data into a repository
constructed from graph vectors. Subsequently, this repository is used to
improve the discriminability of gait features in new tasks, thereby enhancing
the model's ability to effectively recognize gait patterns. We also introduce a
Euclidean Distance Stability Method (EDSN) based on negative pairs, which
ensures that newly added gait samples from different classes maintain similar
relative spatial distributions across both previous and current gait tasks,
thereby alleviating the impact of task changes on the distinguishability of
original domain features. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that GaitAdapter
effectively retains gait knowledge acquired from diverse tasks, exhibiting
markedly superior discriminative capability compared to alternative methods.

Result: 在多个分布偏移基准测试中，NAVIA性能提升2.5%以上，推理延迟降低20%以上。

Conclusion: NAVIA有效解决了ETTA问题，平衡了适应能力和计算效率。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an effective solution for adapting
Vision Transformers (ViT) to distribution shifts without additional training
data. However, existing TTA methods often incur substantial computational
overhead, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained real-world
scenarios. To reduce inference cost, plug-and-play token aggregation methods
merge redundant tokens in ViTs to reduce total processed tokens. Albeit
efficient, it suffers from significant performance degradation when directly
integrated with existing TTA methods. We formalize this problem as Efficient
Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), seeking to preserve the adaptation capability of
TTA while reducing inference latency. In this paper, we first provide a
theoretical analysis from a novel mutual information perspective, showing that
token aggregation inherently leads to information loss, which cannot be fully
mitigated by conventional norm-tuning-based TTA methods. Guided by this
insight, we propose to \textbf{N}eutralize Token \textbf{A}ggregation
\textbf{v}ia \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{A}ugmentation (\textbf{NAVIA}).
Specifically, we directly augment the [CLS] token embedding and incorporate
adaptive biases into the [CLS] token in shallow layers of ViTs. We
theoretically demonstrate that these augmentations, when optimized via entropy
minimization, recover the information lost due to token aggregation. Extensive
experiments across various out-of-distribution benchmarks demonstrate that
NAVIA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 2.5\%, while
achieving an inference latency reduction of more than 20\%, effectively
addressing the ETTA challenge.

Result: 在标准基准测试中，DepthGait实现了最先进的性能，并在挑战性数据集上取得了高排名-1准确率。

Conclusion: DepthGait通过引入深度图和融合方案，显著提升了步态识别的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Robust gait recognition requires highly discriminative representations, which
are closely tied to input modalities. While binary silhouettes and skeletons
have dominated recent literature, these 2D representations fall short of
capturing sufficient cues that can be exploited to handle viewpoint variations,
and capture finer and meaningful details of gait. In this paper, we introduce a
novel framework, termed DepthGait, that incorporates RGB-derived depth maps and
silhouettes for enhanced gait recognition. Specifically, apart from the 2D
silhouette representation of the human body, the proposed pipeline explicitly
estimates depth maps from a given RGB image sequence and uses them as a new
modality to capture discriminative features inherent in human locomotion. In
addition, a novel multi-scale and cross-level fusion scheme has also been
developed to bridge the modality gap between depth maps and silhouettes.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed
DepthGait achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to peer methods and
attains an impressive mean rank-1 accuracy on the challenging datasets.

Motivation: 现有方法在解缠风格与内容时面临语义重叠和主观性的挑战，SCFlow尝试通过可逆合并绕过这一难题。

Method: SCFlow采用流匹配框架，学习风格与内容之间的双向映射，无需显式监督，利用合成数据集训练。

Result: SCFlow在ImageNet-1k和WikiArt上展示了零样本泛化能力，解缠效果自然涌现。

Conclusion: SCFlow表明，通过可逆合并风格与内容，解缠可以自然实现，无需显式监督。

Abstract: Explicitly disentangling style and content in vision models remains
challenging due to their semantic overlap and the subjectivity of human
perception. Existing methods propose separation through generative or
discriminative objectives, but they still face the inherent ambiguity of
disentangling intertwined concepts. Instead, we ask: Can we bypass explicit
disentanglement by learning to merge style and content invertibly, allowing
separation to emerge naturally? We propose SCFlow, a flow-matching framework
that learns bidirectional mappings between entangled and disentangled
representations. Our approach is built upon three key insights: 1) Training
solely to merge style and content, a well-defined task, enables invertible
disentanglement without explicit supervision; 2) flow matching bridges on
arbitrary distributions, avoiding the restrictive Gaussian priors of diffusion
models and normalizing flows; and 3) a synthetic dataset of 510,000 samples (51
styles $\times$ 10,000 content samples) was curated to simulate disentanglement
through systematic style-content pairing. Beyond controllable generation tasks,
we demonstrate that SCFlow generalizes to ImageNet-1k and WikiArt in zero-shot
settings and achieves competitive performance, highlighting that
disentanglement naturally emerges from the invertible merging process.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合稀疏性和总变分约束的多层线性解混方法（STVMLU），用于高光谱图像解混，提高了精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱解混是预处理关键步骤，需提高解混精度。

Method: 基于多层矩阵分解模型，引入总变分约束考虑空间相似性，采用L1/2范数稀疏约束表征丰度矩阵稀疏性，使用ADMM优化。

Result: 实验表明STVMLU性能优于其他算法。

Conclusion: STVMLU方法有效提升了高光谱图像解混的精度。

Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing aims at estimating material signatures (known as
endmembers) and the corresponding proportions (referred to abundances), which
is a critical preprocessing step in various hyperspectral imagery applications.
This study develops a novel approach called sparsity and total variation (TV)
constrained multilayer linear unmixing (STVMLU) for hyperspectral imagery.
Specifically, based on a multilayer matrix factorization model, to improve the
accuracy of unmixing, a TV constraint is incorporated to consider adjacent
spatial similarity. Additionally, a L1/2-norm sparse constraint is adopted to
effectively characterize the sparsity of the abundance matrix. For optimizing
the STVMLU model, the method of alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) is employed, which allows for the simultaneous extraction of endmembers
and their corresponding abundance matrix. Experimental results illustrate the
enhanced performance of the proposed STVMLU when compared to other algorithms.

TL;DR: MACT是一个多智能体协作框架，通过测试时扩展优化视觉文档理解和视觉问答任务，性能优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在参数规模、自校正能力和复杂推理任务上表现不足，尤其是长视觉上下文和文档任务。

Method: MACT包含四个小规模智能体（规划、执行、判断、回答），通过混合奖励建模和智能体级测试时扩展提升能力。

Result: 在15个基准测试中，MACT的三种变体占据前三名，尤其在长视觉上下文和复杂推理任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: MACT在较小参数规模下实现了优越性能，适用于通用和数学任务，同时显著提升文档和复杂推理任务的表现。

Abstract: Existing vision-language models (VLMs), whether generalists or specialists,
remain constrained by their parameter scale, lack robust self-correction
capabilities, and underperform in tasks involving long visual contexts and
complex reasoning, resulting in suboptimal performance on document-based tasks.
To address this, we propose MACT, a Multi-Agent Collaboration framework with
Test-Time scaling, tailored for visual document understanding and visual
question answering (VQA). It comprises four distinct small-scale agents, i.e.,
planning, execution, judgment, and answer agents, with clearly defined roles
and effective collaboration. Notably, the judgment agent exclusively verifies
correctness and redirects to prior agents for revisions, outperforming
conventional correction strategies. To further expand the capability boundaries
of the framework, we propose mixed reward modeling that balances agent-specific
abilities and global collaboration, as well as agent-wise hybrid test-time
scaling, which customizes different scaling strategies for each agent based on
their functions. Evaluated on benchmarks spanning both document-based and
non-document-based settings, our MACT shows superior performance with a smaller
parameter scale without sacrificing the ability of general and mathematical
tasks. Especially, it stands out in benchmarks involving long visual contexts
and complicated reasoning. The three variants of MACT consistently hold the top
three positions in average scores, leading in 13 of the 15 benchmarks. Code

Motivation: 解决无监督视频分割任务中缺乏监督信号和计算资源消耗大的问题。

Method: 使用SlotMatch框架，通过余弦相似度对齐师生模型的slot表示，无需额外损失或监督。

Result: 学生模型在参数减少3.6倍、速度提升1.9倍的情况下，性能优于教师模型，并超越其他无监督视频分割模型。

Conclusion: SlotMatch是一种简单高效的知识蒸馏方法，显著提升了无监督视频分割的性能和效率。

Abstract: Unsupervised video segmentation is a challenging computer vision task,
especially due to the lack of supervisory signals coupled with the complexity
of visual scenes. To overcome this challenge, state-of-the-art models based on
slot attention often have to rely on large and computationally expensive neural
architectures. To this end, we propose a simple knowledge distillation
framework that effectively transfers object-centric representations to a
lightweight student. The proposed framework, called SlotMatch, aligns
corresponding teacher and student slots via the cosine similarity, requiring no
additional distillation objectives or auxiliary supervision. The simplicity of
SlotMatch is confirmed via theoretical and empirical evidence, both indicating
that integrating additional losses is redundant. We conduct experiments on two
datasets to compare the state-of-the-art teacher model, SlotContrast, with our
distilled student. The results show that our student based on SlotMatch matches
and even outperforms its teacher, while using 3.6x less parameters and running
1.9x faster. Moreover, our student surpasses previous unsupervised video
segmentation models.

TL;DR: Fd-CycleGAN通过增强潜在表示学习改进图像翻译，结合局部邻域编码和频率感知监督，提升生成图像的质量和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进CycleGAN在图像翻译任务中的表现，特别是在低数据量情况下，以生成更视觉一致且语义连贯的图像。

Method: 整合局部邻域编码（LNE）和频率感知监督，使用KL/JS散度和对数相似度度量来量化生成与真实图像分布的匹配程度。

Result: 在Horse2Zebra、Monet2Photo等数据集上表现优于CycleGAN和其他先进方法，生成图像质量更高、收敛更快、模式更多样。

Conclusion: Fd-CycleGAN通过频率引导的潜在学习显著提升图像翻译任务的泛化能力，适用于文档修复、艺术风格迁移等领域。

Abstract: This paper presents Fd-CycleGAN, an image-to-image (I2I) translation
framework that enhances latent representation learning to approximate real data
distributions. Building upon the foundation of CycleGAN, our approach
integrates Local Neighborhood Encoding (LNE) and frequency-aware supervision to
capture fine-grained local pixel semantics while preserving structural
coherence from the source domain. We employ distribution-based loss metrics,
including KL/JS divergence and log-based similarity measures, to explicitly
quantify the alignment between real and generated image distributions in both
spatial and frequency domains. To validate the efficacy of Fd-CycleGAN, we
conduct experiments on diverse datasets -- Horse2Zebra, Monet2Photo, and a
synthetically augmented Strike-off dataset. Compared to baseline CycleGAN and
other state-of-the-art methods, our approach demonstrates superior perceptual
quality, faster convergence, and improved mode diversity, particularly in
low-data regimes. By effectively capturing local and global distribution
characteristics, Fd-CycleGAN achieves more visually coherent and semantically
consistent translations. Our results suggest that frequency-guided latent
learning significantly improves generalization in image translation tasks, with
promising applications in document restoration, artistic style transfer, and
medical image synthesis. We also provide comparative insights with
diffusion-based generative models, highlighting the advantages of our
lightweight adversarial approach in terms of training efficiency and
qualitative output.

Abstract: X-ray medical report generation is one of the important applications of
artificial intelligence in healthcare. With the support of large foundation
models, the quality of medical report generation has significantly improved.
However, challenges such as hallucination and weak disease diagnostic
capability still persist. In this paper, we first construct a large-scale
multi-modal medical knowledge graph (termed M3KG) based on the ground truth
medical report using the GPT-4o. It contains 2477 entities, 3 kinds of
relations, 37424 triples, and 6943 disease-aware vision tokens for the CheXpert
Plus dataset. Then, we sample it to obtain multi-granularity semantic graphs
and use an R-GCN encoder for feature extraction. For the input X-ray image, we
adopt the Swin-Transformer to extract the vision features and interact with the
knowledge using cross-attention. The vision tokens are fed into a Q-former and
retrieved the disease-aware vision tokens using another cross-attention.
Finally, we adopt the large language model to map the semantic knowledge graph,
input X-ray image, and disease-aware vision tokens into language descriptions.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets fully validated the effectiveness of
our proposed knowledge graph and X-ray report generation framework. The source

TL;DR: IMAC是一种自监督框架，通过通道依赖掩码和插值任务解决EEG信号分类中的跨域数据分布偏移问题，显著提升分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号分类因电极配置、采集协议和硬件差异导致数据分布偏移，传统方法难以处理。

Method: IMAC采用3D到2D位置统一映射标准化电极布局，引入时空信号对齐和通道依赖掩码重构任务。

Result: 在10个公开EEG数据集上，IMAC在跨主体和跨中心验证中达到最优分类准确率，鲁棒性显著提升。

Conclusion: IMAC通过时空对齐和分离建模时空信息，有效解决EEG跨域偏移问题，性能优于基线方法。

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification faces significant challenges
due to data distribution shifts caused by heterogeneous electrode
configurations, acquisition protocols, and hardware discrepancies across
domains. This paper introduces IMAC, a novel channel-dependent mask and
imputation self-supervised framework that formulates the alignment of
cross-domain EEG data shifts as a spatial time series imputation task. To
address heterogeneous electrode configurations in cross-domain scenarios, IMAC
first standardizes different electrode layouts using a 3D-to-2D positional
unification mapping strategy, establishing unified spatial representations.
Unlike previous mask-based self-supervised representation learning methods,
IMAC introduces spatio-temporal signal alignment. This involves constructing a
channel-dependent mask and reconstruction task framed as a low-to-high
resolution EEG spatial imputation problem. Consequently, this approach
simulates cross-domain variations such as channel omissions and temporal
instabilities, thus enabling the model to leverage the proposed imputer for
robust signal alignment during inference. Furthermore, IMAC incorporates a
disentangled structure that separately models the temporal and spatial
information of the EEG signals separately, reducing computational complexity
while enhancing flexibility and adaptability. Comprehensive evaluations across
10 publicly available EEG datasets demonstrate IMAC's superior performance,
achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy in both cross-subject and
cross-center validation scenarios. Notably, IMAC shows strong robustness under
both simulated and real-world distribution shifts, surpassing baseline methods
by up to $35$\% in integrity scores while maintaining consistent classification
accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷启动主动学习（CSAL）在医学图像分析中缺乏先验知识时选择信息样本，现有方法依赖自监督学习（SSL），效率低且特征表示不足。基础模型（FMs）具有强大的特征提取能力，但缺乏相关基准测试。

Method: 提出MedCAL-Bench基准测试，评估14种FMs和7种CSAL策略在7个医学图像数据集上的表现，覆盖分类和分割任务。

Result: 1）大多数FMs是有效的特征提取器，DINO家族在分割任务中表现最佳；2）FMs在分割任务中性能差异大，分类任务中差异小；3）不同数据集需采用不同样本选择策略。

Conclusion: MedCAL-Bench为FMs在CSAL中的应用提供了系统评估，揭示了FMs和样本选择策略的性能差异，为医学图像分析提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Cold-Start Active Learning (CSAL) aims to select informative samples for
annotation without prior knowledge, which is important for improving annotation
efficiency and model performance under a limited annotation budget in medical
image analysis. Most existing CSAL methods rely on Self-Supervised Learning
(SSL) on the target dataset for feature extraction, which is inefficient and
limited by insufficient feature representation. Recently, pre-trained
Foundation Models (FMs) have shown powerful feature extraction ability with a
potential for better CSAL. However, this paradigm has been rarely investigated,
with a lack of benchmarks for comparison of FMs in CSAL tasks. To this end, we
propose MedCAL-Bench, the first systematic FM-based CSAL benchmark for medical
image analysis. We evaluate 14 FMs and 7 CSAL strategies across 7 datasets
under different annotation budgets, covering classification and segmentation
tasks from diverse medical modalities. It is also the first CSAL benchmark that
evaluates both the feature extraction and sample selection stages. Our
experimental results reveal that: 1) Most FMs are effective feature extractors
for CSAL, with DINO family performing the best in segmentation; 2) The
performance differences of these FMs are large in segmentation tasks, while
small for classification; 3) Different sample selection strategies should be
considered in CSAL on different datasets, with Active Learning by Processing
Surprisal (ALPS) performing the best in segmentation while RepDiv leading for
classification. The code is available at

Result: 实验表明该方法在保持或提升生成质量的同时，实现了3倍加速采样，适用于多种模型和数据集。

Conclusion: 自适应引导调度是释放流式生成模型潜力的关键，为高效可控生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have recently achieved remarkable progress in
image and video synthesis, with classifier-free guidance (CFG) becoming the
standard tool for high-fidelity, controllable generation. However, despite
their practical success, little is known about how guidance interacts with
different stages of the sampling process-especially in the fast, low-step
regimes typical of modern flow-based pipelines. In this work, we uncover and
analyze a fundamental instability: the earliest reverse steps are acutely
sensitive to the guidance scale, owing to a pronounced spike in the relative
strength (RATIO) of conditional to unconditional predictions. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we show that this RATIO spike is
intrinsic to the data distribution, independent of the model architecture, and
causes exponential error amplification when paired with strong guidance. To
address this, we propose a simple, theoretically grounded, RATIO-aware adaptive
guidance schedule that automatically dampens the guidance scale at early steps
based on the evolving RATIO, using a closed-form exponential decay. Our method
is lightweight, requires no additional inference overhead, and is compatible
with standard flow frameworks. Experiments across state-of-the-art image
(SD3.5, Lumina) and video (WAN2.1) models demonstrate that our approach enables
up to 3x faster sampling while maintaining or improving generation quality,
robustness, and semantic alignment. Extensive ablation studies further confirm
the generality and stability of our schedule across models, datasets, and
hyperparameters. Our findings highlight the critical role of stepwise guidance
adaptation in unlocking the full potential of fast flow-based generative
models.

Conclusion: CoPS通过动态提示和语义特征融合，显著提升了零样本异常检测的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Recently, large pre-trained vision-language models have shown remarkable
performance in zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD). With fine-tuning on a single
auxiliary dataset, the model enables cross-category anomaly detection on
diverse datasets covering industrial defects and medical lesions. Compared to
manually designed prompts, prompt learning eliminates the need for expert
knowledge and trial-and-error. However, it still faces the following
challenges: (i) static learnable tokens struggle to capture the continuous and
diverse patterns of normal and anomalous states, limiting generalization to
unseen categories; (ii) fixed textual labels provide overly sparse category
information, making the model prone to overfitting to a specific semantic
subspace. To address these issues, we propose Conditional Prompt Synthesis
(CoPS), a novel framework that synthesizes dynamic prompts conditioned on
visual features to enhance ZSAD performance. Specifically, we extract
representative normal and anomaly prototypes from fine-grained patch features
and explicitly inject them into prompts, enabling adaptive state modeling.
Given the sparsity of class labels, we leverage a variational autoencoder to
model semantic image features and implicitly fuse varied class tokens into
prompts. Additionally, integrated with our spatially-aware alignment mechanism,
extensive experiments demonstrate that CoPS surpasses state-of-the-art methods
by 2.5% AUROC in both classification and segmentation across 13 industrial and
medical datasets. Code will be available at https://github.com/cqylunlun/CoPS.

Conclusion: 双摄像头框架有效解决了摩尔纹与真实纹理的区分问题，并保持了色调和时间一致性，为去摩尔纹任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Moire patterns, unwanted color artifacts in images and videos, arise from the
interference between spatially high-frequency scene contents and the spatial
discrete sampling of digital cameras. Existing demoireing methods primarily
rely on single-camera image/video processing, which faces two critical
challenges: 1) distinguishing moire patterns from visually similar real
textures, and 2) preserving tonal consistency and temporal coherence while
removing moire artifacts. To address these issues, we propose a dual-camera
framework that captures synchronized videos of the same scene: one in focus
(retaining high-quality textures but may exhibit moire patterns) and one
defocused (with significantly reduced moire patterns but blurred textures). We
use the defocused video to help distinguish moire patterns from real texture,
so as to guide the demoireing of the focused video. We propose a frame-wise
demoireing pipeline, which begins with an optical flow based alignment step to
address any discrepancies in displacement and occlusion between the focused and
defocused frames. Then, we leverage the aligned defocused frame to guide the
demoireing of the focused frame using a multi-scale CNN and a multi-dimensional
training loss. To maintain tonal and temporal consistency, our final step
involves a joint bilateral filter to leverage the demoireing result from the
CNN as the guide to filter the input focused frame to obtain the final output.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework largely
outperforms state-of-the-art image and video demoireing methods.

Conclusion: AVPDN通过自适应特征交互和多尺度上下文整合，显著提升了视频息肉检测的性能。

Abstract: Accurate detection of polyps is of critical importance for the early and
intermediate stages of colorectal cancer diagnosis. Compared to static images,
dynamic colonoscopy videos provide more comprehensive visual information, which
can facilitate the development of effective treatment plans. However, unlike
fixed-camera recordings, colonoscopy videos often exhibit rapid camera
movement, introducing substantial background noise that disrupts the structural
integrity of the scene and increases the risk of false positives. To address
these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Video Polyp Detection Network
(AVPDN), a robust framework for multi-scale polyp detection in colonoscopy
videos. AVPDN incorporates two key components: the Adaptive Feature Interaction
and Augmentation (AFIA) module and the Scale-Aware Context Integration (SACI)
module. The AFIA module adopts a triple-branch architecture to enhance feature
representation. It employs dense self-attention for global context modeling,
sparse self-attention to mitigate the influence of low query-key similarity in
feature aggregation, and channel shuffle operations to facilitate inter-branch
information exchange. In parallel, the SACI module is designed to strengthen
multi-scale feature integration. It utilizes dilated convolutions with varying
receptive fields to capture contextual information at multiple spatial scales,
thereby improving the model's denoising capability. Experiments conducted on
several challenging public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization ability of the proposed method, achieving competitive
performance in video-based polyp detection tasks.

Method: 分析了视觉注意力与长序列幻觉的关系，提出IKOD策略，通过合并高图像注意力的短序列来抑制幻觉。

Result: 实验表明IKOD能有效减少幻觉并提升模型性能，且不增加额外计算成本。

Conclusion: IKOD是一种轻量高效的解决方案，适用于多种LVLMs，无需额外资源。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
significant progress across multiple domains. However, these models still face
the inherent challenge of integrating vision and language for collaborative
inference, which often leads to "hallucinations", outputs that are not grounded
in the corresponding images. Many efforts have been made to address these
issues, but each comes with its own limitations, such as high computational
cost or expensive dataset annotation. Recent research shows that LVLMs exhibit
a long-term bias where hallucinations increase as the sequence length grows,
yet the underlying cause remains poorly understood. Building on extensive
research into attention mechanisms in LVLMs, we analyze the relationship
between this long-term bias and visual attention. In our research, we identify
a consistent phenomenon in current LVLMs: the model's attention to visual input
diminishes as the generated sequence grows, which we hypothesize to be a key
factor contributing to observed increasing hallucinations. Based on these
insights, we propose Image attention-guided Key-value merging cOllaborative
Decoding (IKOD), a collaborative decoding strategy generating more
image-focused sequences. This method derives logits from shorter sequences with
higher image attention through key-value merging and combines them with those
from the original decoding, effectively mitigating attention degradation and
suppressing hallucinations while not incurring too much inference cost.
Extensive experiments on both hallucination and comprehensive benchmarks
demonstrate IKOD's superior effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations and
improving comprehensive capacities for LVLMs. Importantly, IKOD requires no
additional training or external tools, making it a lightweight and efficient
framework applicable to various models.

Method: 采用联合帧优化和视频运动信息融合，将视频帧作为优化实体。

Result: VideoGuard的保护性能优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: VideoGuard有效解决了视频内容保护的问题。

Abstract: With the rapid development of generative technology, current generative
models can generate high-fidelity digital content and edit it in a controlled
manner. However, there is a risk that malicious individuals might misuse these
capabilities for misleading activities. Although existing research has
attempted to shield photographic images from being manipulated by generative
models, there remains a significant disparity in the protection offered to
video content editing. To bridge the gap, we propose a protection method named
VideoGuard, which can effectively protect videos from unauthorized malicious
editing. This protection is achieved through the subtle introduction of nearly
unnoticeable perturbations that interfere with the functioning of the intended
generative diffusion models. Due to the redundancy between video frames, and
inter-frame attention mechanism in video diffusion models, simply applying
image-based protection methods separately to every video frame can not shield
video from unauthorized editing. To tackle the above challenge, we adopt joint
frame optimization, treating all video frames as an optimization entity.
Furthermore, we extract video motion information and fuse it into optimization
objectives. Thus, these alterations can effectively force the models to produce
outputs that are implausible and inconsistent. We provide a pipeline to
optimize this perturbation. Finally, we use both objective metrics and
subjective metrics to demonstrate the efficacy of our method, and the results
show that the protection performance of VideoGuard is superior to all the

*Dasol Choi Jihwan Lee,Minjae Lee,Minsuk Kahng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出SODA框架，用于检测生成对象中的隐性人口偏见，发现模型输出中存在刻板关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究生成对象中的人口偏见，揭示模型中的刻板印象和隐性偏见。

Method: 引入SODA框架，比较中性提示与人口提示生成的图像视觉属性，分析2700张图像。

Result: 发现人口提示与特定视觉属性的强关联，部分模型输出多样性不足，放大视觉差异。

Conclusion: SODA框架为检测和减少生成模型中的偏见提供了实用方法，推动更负责任的AI发展。

Abstract: While prior research on text-to-image generation has predominantly focused on
biases in human depictions, we investigate a more subtle yet pervasive
phenomenon: demographic bias in generated objects (e.g., cars). We introduce
SODA (Stereotyped Object Diagnostic Audit), a novel framework for
systematically measuring such biases. Our approach compares visual attributes
of objects generated with demographic cues (e.g., "for young people'') to those
from neutral prompts, across 2,700 images produced by three state-of-the-art
models (GPT Image-1, Imagen 4, and Stable Diffusion) in five object categories.
Through a comprehensive analysis, we uncover strong associations between
specific demographic groups and visual attributes, such as recurring color
patterns prompted by gender or ethnicity cues. These patterns reflect and
reinforce not only well-known stereotypes but also more subtle and unintuitive
biases. We also observe that some models generate less diverse outputs, which
in turn amplifies the visual disparities compared to neutral prompts. Our
proposed auditing framework offers a practical approach for testing, revealing
how stereotypes still remain embedded in today's generative models. We see this
as an essential step toward more systematic and responsible AI development.

TL;DR: LRQ-DiT提出了一种高效准确的PTQ框架，通过Twin-Log量化和自适应旋转方案解决了DiT模型低比特量化中的权重分布和激活异常问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiT模型在资源受限场景下因高计算成本和参数量大而难以应用，现有PTQ方法在极低比特设置下性能下降严重。

Method: 提出Twin-Log量化（TLQ）和自适应旋转方案（ARS），分别优化权重分布和激活异常问题。

Result: 在PixArt和FLUX上验证，LRQ-DiT在低比特量化下保持图像质量，优于现有PTQ基线。

Conclusion: LRQ-DiT有效解决了DiT模型的低比特量化问题，为资源受限场景提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved impressive performance in
text-to-image generation. However, their high computational cost and large
parameter sizes pose significant challenges for usage in resource-constrained
scenarios. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution to reduce
memory usage and accelerate inference, but existing PTQ methods suffer from
severe performance degradation under extreme low-bit settings. We identify two
key obstacles to low-bit post-training quantization for DiT models: (1) model
weights follow a Gaussian-like distribution with long tails, causing uniform
quantization to poorly allocate intervals and leading to significant errors;
(2) two types of activation outliers: (i) Mild Outliers with slightly elevated
values, and (ii) Salient Outliers with large magnitudes concentrated in
specific channels, which disrupt activation quantization. To address these
issues, we propose LRQ-DiT, an efficient and accurate PTQ framework. We
introduce Twin-Log Quantization (TLQ), a log-based method that aligns well with
the weight distribution and reduces quantization errors. We also propose an
Adaptive Rotation Scheme (ARS) that dynamically applies Hadamard or
outlier-aware rotations based on activation fluctuation, effectively mitigating
the impact of both types of outliers. We evaluate LRQ-DiT on PixArt and FLUX
under various bit-width settings, and validate the performance on COCO, MJHQ,
and sDCI datasets. LRQ-DiT achieves low-bit quantization of DiT models while
preserving image quality, outperforming existing PTQ baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建筑行业资源消耗大，回收材料质量监测仍依赖人工方法，亟需更高效的视觉机器学习解决方案。

Method: 提出ParticleSAM方法，改进分割基础模型，并构建模拟密集多颗粒数据集。

Result: 实验证明ParticleSAM在定量和定性实验中优于原始SAM方法。

Conclusion: ParticleSAM在建筑颗粒分割中表现优异，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The construction industry represents a major sector in terms of resource
consumption. Recycled construction material has high reuse potential, but
quality monitoring of the aggregates is typically still performed with manual
methods. Vision-based machine learning methods could offer a faster and more
efficient solution to this problem, but existing segmentation methods are by
design not directly applicable to images with hundreds of small particles. In
this paper, we propose ParticleSAM, an adaptation of the segmentation
foundation model to images with small and dense objects such as the ones often
encountered in construction material particles. Moreover, we create a new dense
multi-particle dataset simulated from isolated particle images with the
assistance of an automated data generation and labeling pipeline. This dataset
serves as a benchmark for visual material quality control automation while our
segmentation approach has the potential to be valuable in application areas
beyond construction where small-particle segmentation is needed. Our
experimental results validate the advantages of our method by comparing to the
original SAM method both in quantitative and qualitative experiments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了稀疏字典学习（SDL）中稀疏性对图像恢复质量的影响，发现不同优化方法会导致不同的稀疏性模式，且高稀疏性通常不会影响恢复质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏性是SDL中重要的特性，但稀疏性程度对恢复质量的影响尚不明确，本文旨在探讨这一问题。

Method: 通过多种优化方法（如迭代收缩算法）解决SDL中的非光滑优化问题，分析不同方法产生的稀疏性模式。

Result: 研究发现不同优化方法会导致不同的稀疏性模式，且高稀疏性通常不会影响恢复质量，即使恢复图像与学习数据库差异较大。

Conclusion: 高稀疏性在SDL中是可取的，不会显著影响图像恢复质量，为实际应用提供了指导。

Abstract: Sparse dictionary learning (SDL) is a fundamental technique that is useful
for many image processing tasks. As an example we consider here image recovery,
where SDL can be cast as a nonsmooth optimization problem. For this kind of
problems, iterative shrinkage methods represent a powerful class of algorithms
that are subject of ongoing research. Sparsity is an important property of the
learned solutions, as exactly the sparsity enables efficient further processing
or storage. The sparsity implies that a recovered image is determined as a
combination of a number of dictionary elements that is as low as possible.
Therefore, the question arises, to which degree sparsity should be enforced in
SDL in order to not compromise recovery quality. In this paper we focus on the
sparsity of solutions that can be obtained using a variety of optimization
methods. It turns out that there are different sparsity regimes depending on
the method in use. Furthermore, we illustrate that high sparsity does in
general not compromise recovery quality, even if the recovered image is quite
different from the learning database.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PECM的框架，通过多级原型和双流置信度估计，提升了医学图像与文本报告的跨模态检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学数据固有的模糊性和变异性导致现有模型难以准确对齐图像与文本，检索结果不可靠。

Method: PECM框架引入多级原型捕获语义变异性，并采用双流置信度估计和自适应加权机制减少高不确定性数据的影响。

Result: 在多个数据集和任务中，PECM显著提升了检索精度和一致性，性能提升高达10.17%。

Conclusion: PECM有效解决了医学数据模糊性问题，提升了复杂临床场景中的检索可靠性，达到了新的最优性能。

Abstract: In cross-modal retrieval tasks, such as image-to-report and report-to-image
retrieval, accurately aligning medical images with relevant text reports is
essential but challenging due to the inherent ambiguity and variability in
medical data. Existing models often struggle to capture the nuanced,
multi-level semantic relationships in radiology data, leading to unreliable
retrieval results. To address these issues, we propose the Prototype-Enhanced
Confidence Modeling (PECM) framework, which introduces multi-level prototypes
for each modality to better capture semantic variability and enhance retrieval
robustness. PECM employs a dual-stream confidence estimation that leverages
prototype similarity distributions and an adaptive weighting mechanism to
control the impact of high-uncertainty data on retrieval rankings. Applied to
radiology image-report datasets, our method achieves significant improvements
in retrieval precision and consistency, effectively handling data ambiguity and
advancing reliability in complex clinical scenarios. We report results on
multiple different datasets and tasks including fully supervised and zero-shot
retrieval obtaining performance gains of up to 10.17%, establishing in new
state-of-the-art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 服装编辑需要理解服装特定的语义和属性依赖，但高质量指令-图像对的稀缺限制了进展。

Method: 定义了六类编辑指令，并引入Fashion Edit Score作为评估指标，构建了包含20,596个高质量三元组的数据集EditGarment。

Result: 构建了52,257个候选三元组，最终保留了20,596个高质量三元组，形成了EditGarment数据集。

Conclusion: 提出的自动化管道和语义感知指标为服装编辑任务提供了可靠的数据支持。

Abstract: Instruction-based garment editing enables precise image modifications via
natural language, with broad applications in fashion design and customization.
Unlike general editing tasks, it requires understanding garment-specific
semantics and attribute dependencies. However, progress is limited by the
scarcity of high-quality instruction-image pairs, as manual annotation is
costly and hard to scale. While MLLMs have shown promise in automated data
synthesis, their application to garment editing is constrained by imprecise
instruction modeling and a lack of fashion-specific supervisory signals. To
address these challenges, we present an automated pipeline for constructing a
garment editing dataset. We first define six editing instruction categories
aligned with real-world fashion workflows to guide the generation of balanced
and diverse instruction-image triplets. Second, we introduce Fashion Edit
Score, a semantic-aware evaluation metric that captures semantic dependencies
between garment attributes and provides reliable supervision during
construction. Using this pipeline, we construct a total of 52,257 candidate
triplets and retain 20,596 high-quality triplets to build EditGarment, the
first instruction-based dataset tailored to standalone garment editing. The

Result: 在三个医学数据集上无需额外训练即可实现精确分割，优于传统方法和无训练少样本模型。

Conclusion: MAUP为跨域少样本医学图像分割提供了一种高效、无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-domain Few-shot Medical Image Segmentation (CD-FSMIS) is a potential
solution for segmenting medical images with limited annotation using knowledge
from other domains. The significant performance of current CD-FSMIS models
relies on the heavily training procedure over other source medical domains,
which degrades the universality and ease of model deployment. With the
development of large visual models of natural images, we propose a
training-free CD-FSMIS model that introduces the Multi-center Adaptive
Uncertainty-aware Prompting (MAUP) strategy for adapting the foundation model
Segment Anything Model (SAM), which is trained with natural images, into the
CD-FSMIS task. To be specific, MAUP consists of three key innovations: (1)
K-means clustering based multi-center prompts generation for comprehensive
spatial coverage, (2) uncertainty-aware prompts selection that focuses on the
challenging regions, and (3) adaptive prompt optimization that can dynamically
adjust according to the target region complexity. With the pre-trained DINOv2
feature encoder, MAUP achieves precise segmentation results across three
medical datasets without any additional training compared with several
conventional CD-FSMIS models and training-free FSMIS model. The source code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织样本常因尺寸过大需要拼接，但现有方法受限于组织损失、形态变形、染色不一致等问题，难以实现高效拼接。

Method: 利用视觉组织病理学基础模型的潜在特征表示识别相邻区域，并通过大量语义匹配候选进行鲁棒的姿态估计，形成全切片拼接。

Result: 在三个组织病理学数据集上的实验表明，SemanticStitcher在正确边界匹配方面优于现有技术。

Conclusion: SemanticStitcher为组织样本拼接提供了一种鲁棒且高效的解决方案，显著提升了拼接质量。

Abstract: In histopathology, tissue samples are often larger than a standard microscope
slide, making stitching of multiple fragments necessary to process entire
structures such as tumors. Automated stitching is a prerequisite for scaling
analysis, but is challenging due to possible tissue loss during preparation,
inhomogeneous morphological distortion, staining inconsistencies, missing
regions due to misalignment on the slide, or frayed tissue edges. This limits
state-of-the-art stitching methods using boundary shape matching algorithms to
reconstruct artificial whole mount slides (WMS). Here, we introduce
SemanticStitcher using latent feature representations derived from a visual
histopathology foundation model to identify neighboring areas in different
fragments. Robust pose estimation based on a large number of semantic matching
candidates derives a mosaic of multiple fragments to form the WMS. Experiments
on three different histopathology datasets demonstrate that SemanticStitcher
yields robust WMS mosaicing and consistently outperforms the state of the art
in correct boundary matches.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分布感知知识统一与关联（DKUA）框架，通过域风格建模和自适应知识巩固，提升终身行人重识别（LReID）的抗遗忘和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 终身行人重识别（LReID）需平衡旧知识保留与新信息适应，现有方法忽略分布感知和跨域统一知识学习。

Method: 提出DKUA框架，包括分布感知模型、自适应知识巩固（AKC）、统一知识关联（UKA）和基于分布的知识转移（DKT）。

Result: 实验显示DKUA在抗遗忘和泛化能力上分别平均提升7.6%/5.3%（mAP/R@1）。

Conclusion: DKUA通过分布感知和跨域知识统一，显著提升了LReID性能。

Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) encounters a key challenge:
balancing the preservation of old knowledge with adaptation to new information.
Existing LReID methods typically employ knowledge distillation to enforce
representation alignment. However, these approaches ignore two crucial aspects:
specific distribution awareness and cross-domain unified knowledge learning,
both of which are essential for addressing this challenge. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel distribution-aware knowledge unification and
association (DKUA) framework where domain-style modeling is performed for each
instance to propagate domain-specific representations, enhancing
anti-forgetting and generalization capacity. Specifically, we design a
distribution-aware model to transfer instance-level representations of the
current domain into the domain-specific representations with the different
domain styles, preserving learned knowledge without storing old samples. Next,
we propose adaptive knowledge consolidation (AKC) to dynamically generate the
unified representation as a cross-domain representation center. To further
mitigate forgetting, we develop a unified knowledge association (UKA)
mechanism, which explores the unified representation as a bridge to explicitly
model inter-domain associations, reducing inter-domain gaps. Finally,
distribution-based knowledge transfer (DKT) is proposed to prevent the current
domain distribution from deviating from the cross-domain distribution center,
improving adaptation capacity. Experimental results show our DKUA outperforms
the existing methods by 7.6%/5.3% average mAP/R@1 improvement on
anti-forgetting and generalization capacity, respectively. Our code will be
publicly released.

Result: 在13个多样化基准测试中，DyCAF-Net显著提升了精度和mAP，同时保持计算效率和推理速度。

Conclusion: DyCAF-Net因其适应性强，适用于医学影像、监控和自动驾驶等实际检测任务。

Abstract: Recent advancements in object detection rely on modular architectures with
multi-scale fusion and attention mechanisms. However, static fusion heuristics
and class-agnostic attention limit performance in dynamic scenes with
occlusions, clutter, and class imbalance. We introduce Dynamic Class-Aware
Fusion Network (DyCAF-Net) that addresses these challenges through three
innovations: (1) an input-conditioned equilibrium-based neck that iteratively
refines multi-scale features via implicit fixed-point modeling, (2) a dual
dynamic attention mechanism that adaptively recalibrates channel and spatial
responses using input- and class-dependent cues, and (3) class-aware feature
adaptation that modulates features to prioritize discriminative regions for
rare classes. Through comprehensive ablation studies with YOLOv8 and related
architectures, alongside benchmarking against nine state-of-the-art baselines,
DyCAF-Net achieves significant improvements in precision, mAP@50, and mAP@50-95
across 13 diverse benchmarks, including occlusion-heavy and long-tailed
datasets. The framework maintains computational efficiency ($\sim$11.1M
parameters) and competitive inference speeds, while its adaptability to scale
variance, semantic overlaps, and class imbalance positions it as a robust
solution for real-world detection tasks in medical imaging, surveillance, and
autonomous systems.

Conclusion: CoEmoGen为情感驱动的艺术创作提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Emotional Image Content Generation (EICG) aims to generate semantically clear
and emotionally faithful images based on given emotion categories, with broad
application prospects. While recent text-to-image diffusion models excel at
generating concrete concepts, they struggle with the complexity of abstract
emotions. There have also emerged methods specifically designed for EICG, but
they excessively rely on word-level attribute labels for guidance, which suffer
from semantic incoherence, ambiguity, and limited scalability. To address these
challenges, we propose CoEmoGen, a novel pipeline notable for its semantic
coherence and high scalability. Specifically, leveraging multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), we construct high-quality captions focused on
emotion-triggering content for context-rich semantic guidance. Furthermore,
inspired by psychological insights, we design a Hierarchical Low-Rank
Adaptation (HiLoRA) module to cohesively model both polarity-shared low-level
features and emotion-specific high-level semantics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate CoEmoGen's superiority in emotional faithfulness and semantic
coherence from quantitative, qualitative, and user study perspectives. To
intuitively showcase scalability, we curate EmoArt, a large-scale dataset of
emotionally evocative artistic images, providing endless inspiration for
emotion-driven artistic creation. The dataset and code are available at

Abstract: Retinal microvascular imaging is increasingly recognised as a non invasive
method for evaluating systemic vascular and metabolic health. However, the
association between lipidomics and retinal vasculature remains inadequate. This
study investigates the relationships between serum lipid subclasses, free fatty
acids (FA), diacylglycerols (DAG), triacylglycerols (TAG), and cholesteryl
esters (CE), and retinal microvascular characteristics in a large
population-based cohort. Using Spearman correlation analysis, we examined the
interconnection between lipid subclasses and ten retinal microvascular traits,
applying the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (BH-FDR) to adjust for
statistical significance.
  Results indicated that FA were linked to retinal vessel twistiness, while CE
correlated with the average widths of arteries and veins. Conversely, DAG and
TAG showed negative correlations with the width and complexity of arterioles
and venules. These findings suggest that retinal vascular architecture reflects
distinct circulating lipid profiles, supporting its role as a non-invasive
marker of systemic metabolic health. This study is the first to integrate deep
learning (DL)derived retinal traits with lipidomic subclasses in a healthy
cohort, thereby providing insights into microvascular structural changes
independent of disease status or treatment effects.

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in anomaly synthesis methods, existing
diffusion-based and coarse inpainting pipelines commonly suffer from structural
deficiencies such as micro-structural discontinuities, limited semantic
controllability, and inefficient generation. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce ARAS, a language-conditioned, auto-regressive anomaly synthesis
approach that precisely injects local, text-specified defects into normal
images via token-anchored latent editing. Leveraging a hard-gated
auto-regressive operator and a training-free, context-preserving masked
sampling kernel, ARAS significantly enhances defect realism, preserves
fine-grained material textures, and provides continuous semantic control over
synthesized anomalies. Integrated within our Quality-Aware Re-weighted Anomaly
Detection (QARAD) framework, we further propose a dynamic weighting strategy
that emphasizes high-quality synthetic samples by computing an image-text
similarity score with a dual-encoder model. Extensive experiments across three
benchmark datasets-MVTec AD, VisA, and BTAD, demonstrate that our QARAD
outperforms SOTA methods in both image- and pixel-level anomaly detection
tasks, achieving improved accuracy, robustness, and a 5 times synthesis speedup
compared to diffusion-based alternatives. Our complete code and synthesized
dataset will be publicly available.

Conclusion: 该研究为多模态AI在数学内容识别领域的未来发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Conversion of spoken mathematical expressions is a challenging task that
involves transcribing speech into a strictly structured symbolic representation
while addressing the ambiguity inherent in the pronunciation of equations.
Although significant progress has been achieved in automatic speech recognition
(ASR) and language models (LM), the problem of converting spoken mathematics
into LaTeX remains underexplored. This task directly applies to educational and
research domains, such as lecture transcription or note creation. Based on ASR
post-correction, prior work requires 2 transcriptions, focuses only on isolated
equations, has a limited test set, and provides neither training data nor
multilingual coverage. To address these issues, we present the first fully
open-source large-scale dataset, comprising over 66,000 human-annotated audio
samples of mathematical equations and sentences in both English and Russian,
drawn from diverse scientific domains. In addition to the ASR post-correction
models and few-shot prompting, we apply audio language models, demonstrating
comparable character error rate (CER) results on the MathSpeech benchmark (28%
vs. 30%) for the equations conversion. In contrast, on the proposed
S2L-equations benchmark, our models outperform the MathSpeech model by a
substantial margin of more than 40 percentage points, even after accounting for
LaTeX formatting artifacts (27% vs. 64%). We establish the first benchmark for
mathematical sentence recognition (S2L-sentences) and achieve an equation CER
of 40%. This work lays the groundwork for future advances in multimodal AI,
with a particular focus on mathematical content recognition.

Austria and compare these estimates to camera trap data. Traditional methods
like capture-recapture, distance sampling, or camera traps are well-established
but labour-intensive or spatially constrained. Using thermal (IR) and RGB
imagery, drones enable efficient, non-intrusive animal counting. Our surveys
were conducted during the leafless period on single days in October and
November 2024 in three areas of a sub-Illyrian hill and terrace landscape.
Flight transects were based on predefined launch points using a 350 m grid and
an algorithm that defined the direction of systematically randomized transects.
This setup allowed surveying large areas in one day using multiple drones,
minimizing double counts. Flight altitude was set at 60 m to avoid disturbing
roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) while ensuring detection. Animals were manually
annotated in the recorded imagery and extrapolated to densities per square
kilometer. We applied three extrapolation methods with increasing complexity:
naive area-based extrapolation, bootstrapping, and zero-inflated negative
binomial modelling. For comparison, a Random Encounter Model (REM) estimate was
calculated using camera trap data from the flight period. The drone-based
methods yielded similar results, generally showing higher densities than REM,
except in one area in October. We hypothesize that drone-based density reflects
daytime activity in open and forested areas, while REM estimates average
activity over longer periods within forested zones. Although both approaches
estimate density, they offer different perspectives on wildlife presence. Our
results show that drones offer a promising, scalable method for wildlife
density estimation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对农村历史地图的高效、可扩展的机器学习流程，用于提取稀疏分布的建筑物足迹，验证了其性能并发现了一处可能被废弃的定居点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在分析农村地区历史地图时计算量大且效率低的问题，以支持历史人口普查验证和废弃定居点定位等研究。

Method: 采用分层机器学习方法，先用CNN分类器筛选出可能包含建筑物的区域，再用CNN分割算法提取建筑物特征。

Result: 在爱尔兰历史地图上验证了高效性和高性能，发现了一处可能因大饥荒时期废弃的定居点。

Conclusion: 该方法为历史考古研究提供了高效工具，并揭示了潜在的历史变迁信息。

Abstract: Historical maps offer a valuable lens through which to study past landscapes
and settlement patterns. While prior research has leveraged machine learning
based techniques to extract building footprints from historical maps, such
approaches have largely focused on urban areas and tend to be computationally
intensive. This presents a challenge for research questions requiring analysis
across extensive rural regions, such as verifying historical census data or
locating abandoned settlements. In this paper, this limitation is addressed by
proposing a scalable and efficient pipeline tailored to rural maps with sparse
building distributions. The method described employs a hierarchical machine
learning based approach: convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers are
first used to progressively filter out map sections unlikely to contain
buildings, significantly reducing the area requiring detailed analysis. The
remaining high probability sections are then processed using CNN segmentation
algorithms to extract building features. The pipeline is validated using test
sections from the Ordnance Survey Ireland historical 25 inch map series and 6
inch map series, demonstrating both high performance and improved efficiency
compared to conventional segmentation-only approaches. Application of the
technique to both map series, covering the same geographic region, highlights
its potential for historical and archaeological discovery. Notably, the
pipeline identified a settlement of approximately 22 buildings in Tully, Co.
Galway, present in the 6 inch map, produced in 1839, but absent from the 25
inch map, produced in 1899, suggesting it may have been abandoned during the
Great Famine period.

Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted the potential of adapting the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) for various downstream tasks. However, constructing a more
powerful and generalizable encoder to further enhance performance remains an
open challenge. In this work, we propose SAM2-UNeXT, an advanced framework that
builds upon the core principles of SAM2-UNet while extending the
representational capacity of SAM2 through the integration of an auxiliary
DINOv2 encoder. By incorporating a dual-resolution strategy and a dense glue
layer, our approach enables more accurate segmentation with a simple
architecture, relaxing the need for complex decoder designs. Extensive
experiments conducted on four benchmarks, including dichotomous image
segmentation, camouflaged object detection, marine animal segmentation, and
remote sensing saliency detection, demonstrate the superior performance of our
proposed method. The code is available at

Motivation: 传统内窥镜受限于毫米级厚度，金属透镜虽有望解决这一问题，但其物理特性导致数据获取和算法研究存在空白。

Method: 建立金属透镜内窥镜数据集，提出MetaScope网络，包含光学强度调整（OIA）和色差校正（OCC），并通过梯度引导蒸馏增强学习。

Result: MetaScope在金属透镜分割和恢复任务中优于现有方法，并在真实生物医学场景中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MetaScope成功填补了金属透镜内窥镜的研究空白，为微型内窥镜的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Miniaturized endoscopy has advanced accurate visual perception within the
human body. Prevailing research remains limited to conventional cameras
employing convex lenses, where the physical constraints with millimetre-scale
thickness impose serious impediments on the micro-level clinical. Recently,
with the emergence of meta-optics, ultra-micro imaging based on metalenses
(micron-scale) has garnered great attention, serving as a promising solution.
However, due to the physical difference of metalens, there is a large gap in
data acquisition and algorithm research. In light of this, we aim to bridge
this unexplored gap, advancing the novel metalens endoscopy. First, we
establish datasets for metalens endoscopy and conduct preliminary optical
simulation, identifying two derived optical issues that physically adhere to
strong optical priors. Second, we propose MetaScope, a novel optics-driven
neural network tailored for metalens endoscopy driven by physical optics.
MetaScope comprises two novel designs: Optics-informed Intensity Adjustment
(OIA), rectifying intensity decay by learning optical embeddings, and
Optics-informed Chromatic Correction (OCC), mitigating chromatic aberration by
learning spatial deformations informed by learned Point Spread Function (PSF)
distributions. To enhance joint learning, we further deploy a gradient-guided
distillation to transfer knowledge from the foundational model adaptively.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaScope not only outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both metalens segmentation and restoration but also
achieves impressive generalized ability in real biomedical scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 雷达姿态估计具有隐私保护和光照不变性优势，但受噪声和多路径效应影响。

Method: 使用概率编码器-解码器架构处理MIMO雷达数据，结合变分推断预测关节位置和不确定性。

Result: 在光学动捕数据集上，平均关节位置误差为6.425 cm，不确定性校准表现良好。

Conclusion: RadProPoser首次实现端到端雷达姿态估计，为可靠的人体运动分析奠定基础。

Abstract: Radar-based human pose estimation (HPE) provides a privacy-preserving,
illumination-invariant sensing modality but is challenged by noisy,
multipath-affected measurements. We introduce RadProPoser, a probabilistic
encoder-decoder architecture that processes complex-valued radar tensors from a
compact 3-transmitter, 4-receiver MIMO radar. By incorporating variational
inference into keypoint regression, RadProPoser jointly predicts 26
three-dimensional joint locations alongside heteroscedastic aleatoric
uncertainties and can be recalibrated to predict total uncertainty. We explore
different probabilistic formulations using both Gaussian and Laplace
distributions for latent priors and likelihoods. On our newly released dataset
with optical motion-capture ground truth, RadProPoser achieves an overall mean
per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 6.425 cm, with 5.678 cm at the 45 degree
aspect angle. The learned uncertainties exhibit strong alignment with actual
pose errors and can be calibrated to produce reliable prediction intervals,
with our best configuration achieving an expected calibration error of 0.021.
As an additional demonstration, sampling from these latent distributions
enables effective data augmentation for downstream activity classification,
resulting in an F1 score of 0.870. To our knowledge, this is the first
end-to-end radar tensor-based HPE system to explicitly model and quantify
per-joint uncertainty from raw radar tensor data, establishing a foundation for
explainable and reliable human motion analysis in radar applications.

Attention Zoom on multiple CNN backbones using CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet,

Visual analyses using Grad-CAM and spatial warping reveal that our method
encourages fine-grained and diverse attention patterns. Our results confirm the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云层和夜间条件限制了多光谱卫星图像的可用性和可靠性，而Sentinel-1雷达数据不受这些条件影响。

Method: 采用基于条件潜在流匹配的多阶段训练方法，并首次将余弦调度与流匹配结合。

Result: 生成的光学图像FID得分为0.7432，NDWI和NDVI的SSIM分别为0.6156和0.6874，表明生成图像的高保真度和结构相似性。

Conclusion: CloudBreaker为多光谱数据不可靠或不可用的遥感应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Cloud cover and nighttime conditions remain significant limitations in
satellite-based remote sensing, often restricting the availability and
usability of multi-spectral imagery. In contrast, Sentinel-1 radar images are
unaffected by cloud cover and can provide consistent data regardless of weather
or lighting conditions. To address the challenges of limited satellite imagery,
we propose CloudBreaker, a novel framework that generates high-quality
multi-spectral Sentinel-2 signals from Sentinel-1 data. This includes the
reconstruction of optical (RGB) images as well as critical vegetation and water
indices such as NDVI and NDWI.We employed a novel multi-stage training approach
based on conditional latent flow matching and, to the best of our knowledge,
are the first to integrate cosine scheduling with flow matching. CloudBreaker
demonstrates strong performance, achieving a Frechet Inception Distance (FID)
score of 0.7432, indicating high fidelity and realism in the generated optical
imagery. The model also achieved Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of
0.6156 for NDWI and 0.6874 for NDVI, indicating a high degree of structural
similarity. This establishes CloudBreaker as a promising solution for a wide
range of remote sensing applications where multi-spectral data is typically
unavailable or unreliable

Result: 在e-CK+数据库上达到93.6%的识别率，比现有方法提升25.9%以上。

Conclusion: evTransFER框架通过迁移学习和改进的架构设计，显著提升了事件相机在表情识别任务中的性能。

Abstract: Event-based cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that asynchronously
capture per-pixel intensity changes with microsecond latency, high temporal
resolution, and high dynamic range, providing valuable information about the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the scene. In the present work, we propose
evTransFER, a transfer learning-based framework and architecture for face
expression recognition using event-based cameras. The main contribution is a
feature extractor designed to encode the spatio-temporal dynamics of faces,
built by training an adversarial generative method on a different problem
(facial reconstruction) and then transferring the trained encoder weights to
the face expression recognition system. We show that this proposed transfer
learning method greatly improves the ability to recognize facial expressions
compared to training a network from scratch. In addition, we propose an
architecture that incorporates an LSTM to capture longer-term facial expression
dynamics, and we introduce a new event-based representation, referred to as
TIE, both of which further improve the results. We evaluate the proposed
framework on the event-based facial expression database e-CK+ and compare it to
state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the proposed framework
evTransFER achieves a 93.6\% recognition rate on the e-CK+ database,
significantly improving the accuracy (25.9\% points or more) when compared to
state-of-the-art performance for similar problems.

Abstract: We introduce FPG-NAS, a FLOPs-aware Gated Differentiable Neural Architecture
Search framework for efficient 6DoF object pose estimation. Estimating 3D
rotation and translation from a single image has been widely investigated yet
remains computationally demanding, limiting applicability in
resource-constrained scenarios. FPG-NAS addresses this by proposing a
specialized differentiable NAS approach for 6DoF pose estimation, featuring a
task-specific search space and a differentiable gating mechanism that enables
discrete multi-candidate operator selection, thus improving architectural
diversity. Additionally, a FLOPs regularization term ensures a balanced
trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. The framework explores a vast search
space of approximately 10\textsuperscript{92} possible architectures.
Experiments on the LINEMOD and SPEED+ datasets demonstrate that FPG-NAS-derived
models outperform previous methods under strict FLOPs constraints. To the best
of our knowledge, FPG-NAS is the first differentiable NAS framework
specifically designed for 6DoF object pose estimation.

Conclusion: Uni3R为可泛化的统一3D场景重建和理解提供了新范式。

Abstract: Reconstructing and semantically interpreting 3D scenes from sparse 2D views
remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Conventional methods often
decouple semantic understanding from reconstruction or necessitate costly
per-scene optimization, thereby restricting their scalability and
generalizability. In this paper, we introduce Uni3R, a novel feed-forward
framework that jointly reconstructs a unified 3D scene representation enriched
with open-vocabulary semantics, directly from unposed multi-view images. Our
approach leverages a Cross-View Transformer to robustly integrate information
across arbitrary multi-view inputs, which then regresses a set of 3D Gaussian
primitives endowed with semantic feature fields. This unified representation
facilitates high-fidelity novel view synthesis, open-vocabulary 3D semantic
segmentation, and depth prediction, all within a single, feed-forward pass.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni3R establishes a new state-of-the-art
across multiple benchmarks, including 25.07 PSNR on RE10K and 55.84 mIoU on
ScanNet. Our work signifies a novel paradigm towards generalizable, unified 3D

completion can be decoupled into two multi-modal distributions: one capturing
how measurements project into a normalized object reference frame defined by
the dataset and the other modelling a prior over object geometries represented
as triplanar neural fields. By training separate conditional diffusion models
for these two distributions, we enable sampling multiple hypotheses from the
joint pose and shape distribution. OmniShape demonstrates compelling
performance on challenging real world datasets. Project website:

Conclusion: Veila为全景LiDAR数据生成提供了一种高效可控的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Realistic and controllable panoramic LiDAR data generation is critical for
scalable 3D perception in autonomous driving and robotics. Existing methods
either perform unconditional generation with poor controllability or adopt
text-guided synthesis, which lacks fine-grained spatial control. Leveraging a
monocular RGB image as a spatial control signal offers a scalable and low-cost
alternative, which remains an open problem. However, it faces three core
challenges: (i) semantic and depth cues from RGB are vary spatially,
complicating reliable conditioning generation; (ii) modality gaps between RGB
appearance and LiDAR geometry amplify alignment errors under noisy diffusion;
and (iii) maintaining structural coherence between monocular RGB and panoramic
LiDAR is challenging, particularly in non-overlap regions between images and
LiDAR. To address these challenges, we propose Veila, a novel conditional
diffusion framework that integrates: a Confidence-Aware Conditioning Mechanism
(CACM) that strengthens RGB conditioning by adaptively balancing semantic and
depth cues according to their local reliability; a Geometric Cross-Modal
Alignment (GCMA) for robust RGB-LiDAR alignment under noisy diffusion; and a
Panoramic Feature Coherence (PFC) for enforcing global structural consistency
across monocular RGB and panoramic LiDAR. Additionally, we introduce two
metrics, Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency and Cross-Modal Depth Consistency, to
evaluate alignment quality across modalities. Experiments on nuScenes,
SemanticKITTI, and our proposed KITTI-Weather benchmark demonstrate that Veila
achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity and cross-modal consistency,
while enabling generative data augmentation that improves downstream LiDAR
semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Controllable generation of realistic LiDAR scenes is crucial for applications
such as autonomous driving and robotics. While recent diffusion-based models
achieve high-fidelity LiDAR generation, they lack explicit control over
foreground objects and spatial relationships, limiting their usefulness for
scenario simulation and safety validation. To address these limitations, we
propose Large-scale Layout-guided LiDAR generation model ("La La LiDAR"), a
novel layout-guided generative framework that introduces semantic-enhanced
scene graph diffusion with relation-aware contextual conditioning for
structured LiDAR layout generation, followed by foreground-aware control
injection for complete scene generation. This enables customizable control over
object placement while ensuring spatial and semantic consistency. To support
our structured LiDAR generation, we introduce Waymo-SG and nuScenes-SG, two
large-scale LiDAR scene graph datasets, along with new evaluation metrics for
layout synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that La La LiDAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both LiDAR generation and downstream perception
tasks, establishing a new benchmark for controllable 3D scene generation.

Abstract: Generative world models have become essential data engines for autonomous
driving, yet most existing efforts focus on videos or occupancy grids,
overlooking the unique LiDAR properties. Extending LiDAR generation to dynamic
4D world modeling presents challenges in controllability, temporal coherence,
and evaluation standardization. To this end, we present LiDARCrafter, a unified
framework for 4D LiDAR generation and editing. Given free-form natural language
inputs, we parse instructions into ego-centric scene graphs, which condition a
tri-branch diffusion network to generate object structures, motion
trajectories, and geometry. These structured conditions enable diverse and
fine-grained scene editing. Additionally, an autoregressive module generates
temporally coherent 4D LiDAR sequences with smooth transitions. To support
standardized evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark with diverse
metrics spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level aspects. Experiments on
the nuScenes dataset using this benchmark demonstrate that LiDARCrafter
achieves state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, controllability, and
temporal consistency across all levels, paving the way for data augmentation
and simulation. The code and benchmark are released to the community.

Motivation: 现有方法在短片段生成上有效，但在长视频生成中存在时间不一致性和视觉退化问题。

Result: LongVie在长范围可控性、一致性和质量上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: LongVie通过创新设计解决了长视频生成的关键挑战，并展示了显著效果。

Abstract: Controllable ultra-long video generation is a fundamental yet challenging
task. Although existing methods are effective for short clips, they struggle to
scale due to issues such as temporal inconsistency and visual degradation. In
this paper, we initially investigate and identify three key factors: separate
noise initialization, independent control signal normalization, and the
limitations of single-modality guidance. To address these issues, we propose
LongVie, an end-to-end autoregressive framework for controllable long video
generation. LongVie introduces two core designs to ensure temporal consistency:
1) a unified noise initialization strategy that maintains consistent generation
across clips, and 2) global control signal normalization that enforces
alignment in the control space throughout the entire video. To mitigate visual
degradation, LongVie employs 3) a multi-modal control framework that integrates
both dense (e.g., depth maps) and sparse (e.g., keypoints) control signals,
complemented by 4) a degradation-aware training strategy that adaptively
balances modality contributions over time to preserve visual quality. We also
introduce LongVGenBench, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 100
high-resolution videos spanning diverse real-world and synthetic environments,
each lasting over one minute. Extensive experiments show that LongVie achieves
state-of-the-art performance in long-range controllability, consistency, and

TL;DR: Trokens是一种新方法，通过将轨迹点转化为语义感知的关系令牌来改进少样本动作识别，结合语义感知采样和运动建模框架，在多个基准测试中达到最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频理解需要有效建模运动和外观信息，尤其是在少样本动作识别中。现有方法在点跟踪方面有进展，但仍面临选择信息点和建模运动模式的挑战。

Method: 提出语义感知采样策略和运动建模框架（HoD和轨迹关系建模），将轨迹令牌与语义特征结合以增强外观特征。

Result: 在六个少样本动作识别基准测试中（如Something-Something-V2、Kinetics等）达到最优性能。

Conclusion: Trokens通过语义感知和运动建模显著提升了少样本动作识别性能。

Abstract: Video understanding requires effective modeling of both motion and appearance
information, particularly for few-shot action recognition. While recent
advances in point tracking have been shown to improve few-shot action
recognition, two fundamental challenges persist: selecting informative points
to track and effectively modeling their motion patterns. We present Trokens, a
novel approach that transforms trajectory points into semantic-aware relational
tokens for action recognition. First, we introduce a semantic-aware sampling
strategy to adaptively distribute tracking points based on object scale and
semantic relevance. Second, we develop a motion modeling framework that
captures both intra-trajectory dynamics through the Histogram of Oriented
Displacements (HoD) and inter-trajectory relationships to model complex action
patterns. Our approach effectively combines these trajectory tokens with
semantic features to enhance appearance features with motion information,
achieving state-of-the-art performance across six diverse few-shot action
recognition benchmarks: Something-Something-V2 (both full and small splits),
Kinetics, UCF101, HMDB51, and FineGym. For project page see

TL;DR: ICARE是一个基于大语言模型代理和动态多选题回答的放射学报告评估框架，提供透明且可解释的临床评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有放射学报告生成评估指标缺乏可解释性，无法满足临床需求。

Method: 利用两个代理（分别基于真实报告和生成报告）生成临床问题并互相测试，通过答案一致性评估报告质量。

Result: ICARE与专家判断一致性显著高于现有指标，且对临床内容敏感，能揭示可解释的错误模式。

Conclusion: ICARE为放射学报告生成提供了透明、可解释且临床相关的评估方法。

Abstract: Radiological imaging is central to diagnosis, treatment planning, and
clinical decision-making. Vision-language foundation models have spurred
interest in automated radiology report generation (RRG), but safe deployment
requires reliable clinical evaluation of generated reports. Existing metrics
often rely on surface-level similarity or behave as black boxes, lacking
interpretability. We introduce ICARE (Interpretable and Clinically-grounded
Agent-based Report Evaluation), an interpretable evaluation framework
leveraging large language model agents and dynamic multiple-choice question
answering (MCQA). Two agents, each with either the ground-truth or generated
report, generate clinically meaningful questions and quiz each other. Agreement
on answers captures preservation and consistency of findings, serving as
interpretable proxies for clinical precision and recall. By linking scores to
question-answer pairs, ICARE enables transparent, and interpretable assessment.
Clinician studies show ICARE aligns significantly more with expert judgment
than prior metrics. Perturbation analyses confirm sensitivity to clinical
content and reproducibility, while model comparisons reveal interpretable error
patterns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决主观NLP任务中标注者分歧的结构化建模问题，并探索如何利用合成数据弥补真实数据中人口统计覆盖不足的缺陷。

Method: 提出DEM-MoE模型，基于标注者人口统计信息将输入路由到专家子网络；测试LLM零样本角色提示生成的合成标注用于数据填补；评估混合真实与合成数据的策略。

Result: DEM-MoE在人口统计组间表现一致且在高分歧数据上表现突出；合成标注与人类标注中度一致；最优混合策略取决于数据集结构。

Conclusion: DEM-MoE和合成数据策略共同提升了多样视角的表征能力。

Abstract: We present an approach to modeling annotator disagreement in subjective NLP
tasks through both architectural and data-centric innovations. Our model,
DEM-MoE (Demographic-Aware Mixture of Experts), routes inputs to expert
subnetworks based on annotator demographics, enabling it to better represent
structured, group-level variation compared to prior models. DEM-MoE
consistently performs competitively across demographic groups, and shows
especially strong results on datasets with high annotator disagreement. To
address sparse demographic coverage, we test whether LLM-generated synthetic
annotations via zero-shot persona prompting can be used for data imputation. We
show these synthetic judgments align moderately well with human annotations on
our data and offer a scalable way to potentially enrich training data. We then
propose and evaluate approaches for blending real and synthetic data using
strategies tailored to dataset structure. We find that the optimal strategies
depend on dataset structure. Together, these contributions improve the
representation of diverse perspectives.

*Giovanni Cherubin,Andrew Paverd*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Highlight & Summarize (H&S)的设计模式，通过将检索增强生成（RAG）系统分为高亮器和总结器两部分，防止恶意用户通过精心设计的提示绕过LLM的安全措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 防止大型语言模型（LLMs）被越狱或劫持是一个重要但具有挑战性的任务，现有方法容易被绕过。

Method: H&S将RAG流程分为高亮器（提取相关段落）和总结器（生成答案），避免将用户问题直接暴露给生成式LLM。

Result: 使用基于LLM的高亮器时，H&S生成的回答在正确性、相关性和质量上优于标准RAG流程。

Conclusion: H&S通过设计防止攻击，同时提高了回答质量，为LLM安全提供了新思路。

Abstract: Preventing jailbreaking and model hijacking of Large Language Models (LLMs)
is an important yet challenging task. For example, when interacting with a
chatbot, malicious users can input specially crafted prompts to cause the LLM
to generate undesirable content or perform a completely different task from its
intended purpose. Existing mitigations for such attacks typically rely on
hardening the LLM's system prompt or using a content classifier trained to
detect undesirable content or off-topic conversations. However, these
probabilistic approaches are relatively easy to bypass due to the very large
space of possible inputs and undesirable outputs. In this paper, we present and
evaluate Highlight & Summarize (H&S), a new design pattern for
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that prevents these attacks by
design. The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline
(i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant
sources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM. This
is achieved by splitting the pipeline into two components: a highlighter, which
takes the user's question and extracts relevant passages ("highlights") from
the retrieved documents, and a summarizer, which takes the highlighted passages
and summarizes them into a cohesive answer. We describe several possible
instantiations of H&S and evaluate their generated responses in terms of
correctness, relevance, and response quality. Surprisingly, when using an
LLM-based highlighter, the majority of H&S responses are judged to be better
than those of a standard RAG pipeline.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了句法操作'Merge'的神经认知机制，发现不同复杂度的Merge结构可能由不同的认知机制支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Merge作为句法核心操作是否由单一机制支持，还是存在多种认知机制。

Method: 通过系统调查参与者对复杂度递增句子的理解，进行聚类分析。

Result: 行为数据显示三种不同的结构类型，可能与不同发展阶段和选择性损伤相关。

Conclusion: Merge可能是进化中突然出现的，但不同类型的Merge对象可能由不同认知机制处理。

Abstract: In the modern language sciences, the core computational operation of syntax,
'Merge', is defined as an operation that combines two linguistic units (e.g.,
'brown', 'cat') to form a categorized structure ('brown cat', a Noun Phrase).
This can then be further combined with additional linguistic units based on
this categorial information, respecting non-associativity such that abstract
grouping is respected. Some linguists have embraced the view that Merge is an
elementary, indivisible operation that emerged in a single evolutionary step.
From a neurocognitive standpoint, different mental objects constructed by Merge
may be supported by distinct mechanisms: (1) simple command constructions
(e.g., "eat apples"); (2) the merging of adjectives and nouns ("red boat"); and
(3) the merging of nouns with spatial prepositions ("laptop behind the sofa").
Here, we systematically investigate participants' comprehension of sentences
with increasing levels of syntactic complexity. Clustering analyses revealed
behavioral evidence for three distinct structural types, which we discuss as
potentially emerging at different developmental stages and subject to selective
impairment. While a Merge-based syntax may still have emerged suddenly in
evolutionary time, responsible for the structured symbolic turn our species
took, different cognitive mechanisms seem to underwrite the processing of
various types of Merge-based objects.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CMRF的新框架，通过迭代自评估推理机制提升多模态模型的常识推理能力，显著优于现有开源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型和视觉语言模型在复杂跨模态推理任务中表现不足，缺乏深度链式推理能力，需要改进。

Method: CMRF框架包含三个模块：RDU分解问题、CIE进行上下文推理、CAM评估逻辑一致性，并结合自适应迭代优化策略。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，CMRF平均准确率达69.4%，优于最佳开源基线2.4个百分点。

Conclusion: CMRF通过模块化设计和迭代优化显著提升了多模态模型的推理能力，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements, current large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (LVLMs) continue to struggle with complex, multi-step,
cross-modal common sense reasoning tasks, often exhibiting a lack of
"deliberative thinking." They tend to rely on superficial associations rather
than deep, chained inference, particularly when integrating visual information
with abstract concepts. To address this, we propose the Coherent Multimodal
Reasoning Framework (CMRF), a novel approach that enhances LVLMs' common sense
reasoning capabilities through an iterative, self-evaluating inference
mechanism. CMRF mimics human problem-solving by decomposing complex queries,
generating step-by-step inferences, and self-correcting errors. Our framework
integrates three key modules: a Reasoning Decomposition Unit (RDU) for breaking
down problems into sub-questions, a Contextual Inference Engine (CIE) for
contextual inference, and a Coherence Assessment Module (CAM) for evaluating
logical consistency and confidence. Coupled with an Adaptive Iterative
Refinement strategy, CMRF systematically refines its reasoning paths. Built
upon LLaVA-1.6-34B and trained on a novel Multimodal Daily Activity Reasoning
(MDAR) dataset, CMRF achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source
LVLMs on challenging benchmarks like VCR, A-OKVQA, and DailyLife-MRC. It
attains an average accuracy of 69.4%, surpassing the best open-source baseline
by +2.4 percentage points, with particular strength in complex reasoning
scenarios. Extensive ablation studies and human evaluations confirm the
critical contributions of each module and the effectiveness of iterative
refinement in fostering more coherent and accurate reasoning.

Motivation: 研究感官语言与LIWC风格特征的关系，探索更高效的模型表示方法。

Method: 使用降秩岭回归（R4）和SLIM-LLMs模型，结合低维LIWC特征。

Result: 低维特征（r=24）表现优于全特征（r=74），SLIM-LLMs参数减少80%且性能相当。

Conclusion: 低维风格特征和SLIM-LLMs模型在感官语言预测中高效且实用。

Abstract: Sensorial language -- the language connected to our senses including vision,
sound, touch, taste, smell, and interoception, plays a fundamental role in how
we communicate experiences and perceptions. We explore the relationship between
sensorial language and traditional stylistic features, like those measured by
LIWC, using a novel Reduced-Rank Ridge Regression (R4) approach. We demonstrate
that low-dimensional latent representations of LIWC features r = 24 effectively
capture stylistic information for sensorial language prediction compared to the
full feature set (r = 74). We introduce Stylometrically Lean Interpretable
Models (SLIM-LLMs), which model non-linear relationships between these style
dimensions. Evaluated across five genres, SLIM-LLMs with low-rank LIWC features
match the performance of full-scale language models while reducing parameters
by up to 80%.

Through experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs, we demonstrate that

conversation generation, including topic coherence, knowledge progression,
character consistency, and control granularity. The framework provides a
standardized method for conversation quality control with applications in
education, therapy, customer service, and entertainment. Future work will focus
on implementing additional parameters through architectural modifications and
developing benchmark datasets for evaluation.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的广泛应用使其成为攻击目标，尤其是越狱攻击，因此需要开发强健的检测方法以确保其安全可靠使用。

Method: 利用上下文共现矩阵和张量的潜在空间特征，提出了一种新颖的检测方法。

Result: 该方法仅需0.5%的标记提示即可达到0.83的F1分数，比基线提升96.6%，且速度显著更快（2.3至128.4倍）。

Conclusion: 该方法在数据稀缺环境下表现出色，为LLMs的安全使用提供了有效解决方案，并公开了实现以支持未来研究。

Abstract: The widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in many applications marks
a significant advance in research and practice. However, their complexity and
hard-to-understand nature make them vulnerable to attacks, especially
jailbreaks designed to produce harmful responses. To counter these threats,
developing strong detection methods is essential for the safe and reliable use
of LLMs. This paper studies this detection problem using the Contextual
Co-occurrence Matrix, a structure recognized for its efficacy in data-scarce
environments. We propose a novel method leveraging the latent space
characteristics of Contextual Co-occurrence Matrices and Tensors for the
effective identification of adversarial and jailbreak prompts. Our evaluations
show that this approach achieves a notable F1 score of 0.83 using only 0.5% of
labeled prompts, which is a 96.6% improvement over baselines. This result
highlights the strength of our learned patterns, especially when labeled data
is scarce. Our method is also significantly faster, speedup ranging from 2.3 to
128.4 times compared to the baseline models. To support future research and
reproducibility, we have made our implementation publicly available.

Conclusion: 呼吁在AI与艺术结合的讨论中更透明地纳入艺术家视角，并提供了未来研究的方法论基础。

Abstract: As generative AI continues to reshape artistic production and alternate modes
of human expression, artists whose livelihoods are most directly affected have
raised urgent concerns about consent, transparency, and the future of creative
labor. However, the voices of artists are often marginalized in dominant public
and scholarly discourse. This study presents a twelve-year analysis, from 2013
to 2025, of English-language discourse surrounding AI-generated art. It draws
from 439 curated 500-word excerpts sampled from opinion articles, news reports,
blogs, legal filings, and spoken-word transcripts. Through a reproducible
methodology, we identify five stable thematic clusters and uncover a
misalignment between artists' perceptions and prevailing media narratives. Our
findings highlight how the use of technical jargon can function as a subtle
form of gatekeeping, often sidelining the very issues artists deem most urgent.
Our work provides a BERTopic-based methodology and a multimodal baseline for
future research, alongside a clear call for deeper, transparency-driven
engagement with artist perspectives in the evolving AI-creative landscape.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PAD的轻量级防御方法，通过在生成过程中向token logits注入校准的高斯噪声，保护RAG系统中的敏感信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统在处理敏感数据时容易受到信息泄露攻击，需要一种无需重新训练或过滤的隐私保护方法。

Method: PAD通过置信度筛选、高效敏感性估计和上下文感知噪声校准，动态注入噪声，并结合RDP会计跟踪隐私损失。

Result: 实验表明，PAD显著减少信息泄露，同时保持生成质量，优于现有防御方法。

Conclusion: PAD为RAG系统提供了一种通用且可扩展的隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the factual accuracy of large
language models (LLMs) by conditioning outputs on external knowledge sources.
However, when retrieval involves private or sensitive data, RAG systems are
susceptible to extraction attacks that can leak confidential information
through generated responses. We propose Privacy-Aware Decoding (PAD), a
lightweight, inference-time defense that adaptively injects calibrated Gaussian
noise into token logits during generation. PAD integrates confidence-based
screening to selectively protect high-risk tokens, efficient sensitivity
estimation to minimize unnecessary noise, and context-aware noise calibration
to balance privacy with generation quality. A \renyi Differential Privacy (RDP)
accountant rigorously tracks cumulative privacy loss, enabling explicit
per-response $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP guarantees for sensitive outputs.
Unlike prior approaches requiring retraining or corpus-level filtering, PAD is
model-agnostic and operates entirely at decoding time with minimal
computational overhead. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate
that PAD substantially reduces private information leakage while preserving
response utility, outperforming existing retrieval- and post-processing-based
defenses. Our work takes an important step toward mitigating privacy risks in
RAG via decoding strategies, paving the way for universal and scalable privacy
solutions in sensitive domains. Our code is available:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RAG框架解决了LLMs的幻觉和知识过时问题，但其引入的外部知识库可能被恶意利用，现有攻击方法在检索和生成阶段的联合优化不足。

Method: 提出TPARAG框架，利用轻量级白盒LLM生成并迭代优化恶意内容，同时针对检索和生成阶段进行攻击。

Result: 在开放域QA数据集上的实验表明，TPARAG在检索阶段和端到端攻击效果上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TPARAG揭示了RAG框架的关键漏洞，为提升其鲁棒性提供了新思路。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
providing trustworthy responses for knowledge-intensive tasks, they still face
critical limitations such as hallucinations and outdated knowledge. To address
these issues, the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework enhances LLMs
with access to external knowledge via a retriever, enabling more accurate and
real-time outputs about the latest events. However, this integration brings new
security vulnerabilities: the risk that malicious content in the external
database can be retrieved and used to manipulate model outputs. Although prior
work has explored attacks on RAG systems, existing approaches either rely
heavily on access to the retriever or fail to jointly consider both retrieval
and generation stages, limiting their effectiveness, particularly in black-box
scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Token-level Precise Attack
on the RAG (TPARAG), a novel framework that targets both white-box and
black-box RAG systems. TPARAG leverages a lightweight white-box LLM as an
attacker to generate and iteratively optimize malicious passages at the token
level, ensuring both retrievability and high attack success in generation.
Extensive experiments on open-domain QA datasets demonstrate that TPARAG
consistently outperforms previous approaches in retrieval-stage and end-to-end
attack effectiveness. These results further reveal critical vulnerabilities in
RAG pipelines and offer new insights into improving their robustness.

Motivation: 理解不同语言中同一主题的情感表达差异，填补现有文献中未探索的跨语言情感比较空白。

Method: 通过手动翻译英语情感词典创建双语词典，标注可比文本的情感与情绪，并统计比较源-目标文档对的一致性。

Result: 来自同一新闻机构的文章情感标注更一致，而不同来源的文章情感标注差异较大。

Conclusion: 该方法具有语言独立性，可推广到其他语言对，为跨语言情感分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Comparable texts are topic-aligned documents in multiple languages that are
not direct translations. They are valuable for understanding how a topic is
discussed across languages. This research studies differences in sentiments and
emotions across English-Arabic comparable documents. First, texts are annotated
with sentiment and emotion labels. We apply a cross-lingual method to label
documents with opinion classes (subjective/objective), avoiding reliance on
machine translation. To annotate with emotions (anger, disgust, fear, joy,
sadness, surprise), we manually translate the English WordNet-Affect (WNA)
lexicon into Arabic, creating bilingual emotion lexicons used to label the
comparable corpora. We then apply a statistical measure to assess the agreement
of sentiments and emotions in each source-target document pair. This comparison
is especially relevant when the documents originate from different sources. To
our knowledge, this aspect has not been explored in prior literature. Our study
includes English-Arabic document pairs from Euronews, BBC, and Al-Jazeera
(JSC). Results show that sentiment and emotion annotations align when articles
come from the same news agency and diverge when they come from different ones.
The proposed method is language-independent and generalizable to other language
pairs.

Conclusion: 多智能体结构和记忆存储模型有效提升了长篇故事生成的质量和连贯性。

Abstract: The generation of a long story consisting of several thousand words is a
sub-task in the field of long text generation~(LTG). Previous research has
addressed this challenge through outline-based generation, which employs a
multi-stage method for generating outlines into stories. However, this approach
suffers from two common issues: almost inevitable theme drift caused by the
loss of memory of previous outlines, and tedious plots with incoherent logic
that are less appealing to human readers.
  In this paper, we propose the multi-agent Story Generator structure to
improve the multi-stage method, using large language models~(LLMs) as the core
components of agents. To avoid theme drift, we introduce a memory storage model
comprising two components: a long-term memory storage that identifies the most
important memories, thereby preventing theme drift; and a short-term memory
storage that retains the latest outlines from each generation round. To
incorporate engaging elements into the story, we design a story theme obstacle
framework based on literary narratology theory that introduces uncertain
factors and evaluation criteria to generate outline. This framework calculates
the similarity of the former storyline and enhances the appeal of the story by
building a knowledge graph and integrating new node content. Additionally, we
establish a multi-agent interaction stage to simulate writer-reader interaction
through dialogue and revise the story text according to feedback, to ensure it
remains consistent and logical. Evaluations against previous methods
demonstrate that our approach can generate higher-quality long stories.

Conclusion: RCP-Merging是一种高效且资源节约的模型合并方法，适用于需要双重能力的场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with long chain-of-thought (CoT) capability,
termed Reasoning Models, demonstrate superior intricate problem-solving
abilities through multi-step long CoT reasoning. To create a dual-capability
model with long CoT capability and domain-specific knowledge without
substantial computational and data costs, model merging emerges as a highly
resource-efficient method. However, significant challenges lie in merging
domain-specific LLMs with long CoT ones since nowadays merging methods suffer
from reasoning capability degradation, even gibberish output and output
collapse. To overcome this, we introduce RCP-Merging: Merging Long
Chain-of-Thought Models with Domain-Specific Models by Considering Reasoning
Capability as Prior, a novel merging framework designed to integrate
domain-specific LLMs with long CoT capability, meanwhile maintaining model
performance in the original domain. Treating reasoning model weights as
foundational prior, our method utilizes a reasoning capability indicator to
preserve core long CoT capability model weights while selectively merging
essential domain-specific weights. We conducted extensive experiments on
Qwen2.5-7B, Llama3.1-8B, and Qwen2.5-1.5B models in BioMedicine and Finance
domains. Our results show that RCP-Merging successfully merges a reasoning
model with domain-specific ones, improving domain task performance by 9.5% and
9.2% over state-of-the-art methods, without significantly harming the original
long CoT reasoning capability.

*Chenyang Wang,Liang Wen,Shousheng Jia,Xiangzheng Zhang,Liang Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种框架，通过严格推理过程（包括预览和自检）提升LLMs在复杂指令下的表现，实验证明其优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在数学、编程等任务上表现优异，但在复杂指令下的准确性仍不稳定，主要原因是推理阶段的懒惰。

Method: 1. 生成复杂约束指令并过滤为三类数据集；2. 通过拒绝采样获取高质量数据；3. 结合熵保持的监督微调（Entropy-SFT）和基于规则的强化学习（TEA-RL）优化模型推理。

Result: Light-IF-32B模型在指令遵循基准测试中表现优异，超越开源和闭源模型。

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提升了LLMs在复杂指令下的推理能力，具有通用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: While advancements in the reasoning abilities of LLMs have significantly
enhanced their performance in solving mathematical problems, coding tasks, and
general puzzles, their effectiveness in accurately adhering to instructions
remains inconsistent, particularly with more complex directives. Our
investigation identifies lazy reasoning during the thinking stage as the
primary factor contributing to poor instruction adherence. To mitigate this
issue, we propose a comprehensive framework designed to enable rigorous
reasoning processes involving preview and self-checking, essential for
satisfying strict instruction constraints. Specifically, we first generate
instructions with complex constraints and apply a filtering process to obtain
valid prompts, resulting in three distinct prompt datasets categorized as hard,
easy, and pass. Then, we employ rejection sampling on the pass prompts to
curate a small yet high-quality dataset, enabling a cold-start initialization
of the model and facilitating its adaptation to effective reasoning patterns.
Subsequently, we employ an entropy-preserving supervised fine-tuning
(Entropy-SFT) strategy coupled with token-wise entropy-adaptive (TEA-RL)
reinforcement learning guided by rule-based dense rewards. This approach
encourages the model to transform its reasoning mechanism, ultimately fostering
generalizable reasoning abilities that encompass preview and self-checking.
Extensive experiments conducted on instruction-following benchmarks demonstrate
remarkable performance improvements across various model scales. Notably, our
Light-IF-32B model surpasses both larger open-source models such as DeepSeek-R1
and closed-source models like Doubao-1.6.

TL;DR: 研究通过机器学习分析德国联邦议院近五年的2.8万篇演讲，发现议题和情感分类模型表现优异，揭示了政党角色与议会话语风格的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨德国联邦议院中政治话语的演变，特别是政党在执政与反对角色转换中的话语风格变化。

Method: 开发并训练了两个机器学习模型（议题分类和情感分类），基于人工标注数据集，应用于分析政党间议题趋势和情感分布。

Result: 模型表现优异（议题分类AUROC 0.94，情感分类0.89），发现政党角色转换显著影响话语风格。

Conclusion: 意识形态和执政责任共同塑造议会话语，研究为理解政党话语策略提供了直接证据。

Abstract: This study investigates political discourse in the German parliament, the
Bundestag, by analyzing approximately 28,000 parliamentary speeches from the
last five years. Two machine learning models for topic and sentiment
classification were developed and trained on a manually labeled dataset. The
models showed strong classification performance, achieving an area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.94 for topic
classification (average across topics) and 0.89 for sentiment classification.
Both models were applied to assess topic trends and sentiment distributions
across political parties and over time. The analysis reveals remarkable
relationships between parties and their role in parliament. In particular, a
change in style can be observed for parties moving from government to
opposition. While ideological positions matter, governing responsibilities also
shape discourse. The analysis directly addresses key questions about the
evolution of topics, sentiment dynamics, and party-specific discourse
strategies in the Bundestag.

TL;DR: 研究发现，文本到图像（T2I）模型中语法性别显著影响视觉表现，男性语法标记使男性形象占比达73%，女性标记则提升女性形象至38%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语法性别如何影响跨语言视觉表现，填补现有研究对性别与语言结构关系的空白。

Method: 构建跨语言基准数据集，覆盖五种性别语言和两种中性语言，生成28,800张图像，分析语法性别对图像生成的影响。

Result: 语法性别显著影响图像生成，男性标记提升男性形象比例，女性标记提升女性形象比例，且效果因语言资源丰富度而异。

Conclusion: 语言结构本身（不仅是内容）影响AI视觉输出，为多语言多模态系统的偏见与公平性研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Research on bias in Text-to-Image (T2I) models has primarily focused on
demographic representation and stereotypical attributes, overlooking a
fundamental question: how does grammatical gender influence visual
representation across languages? We introduce a cross-linguistic benchmark
examining words where grammatical gender contradicts stereotypical gender
associations (e.g., ``une sentinelle'' - grammatically feminine in French but
referring to the stereotypically masculine concept ``guard''). Our dataset
spans five gendered languages (French, Spanish, German, Italian, Russian) and
two gender-neutral control languages (English, Chinese), comprising 800 unique
prompts that generated 28,800 images across three state-of-the-art T2I models.
Our analysis reveals that grammatical gender dramatically influences image
generation: masculine grammatical markers increase male representation to 73\%
on average (compared to 22\% with gender-neutral English), while feminine
grammatical markers increase female representation to 38\% (compared to 28\% in
English). These effects vary systematically by language resource availability
and model architecture, with high-resource languages showing stronger effects.
Our findings establish that language structure itself, not just content, shapes
AI-generated visual outputs, introducing a new dimension for understanding bias
and fairness in multilingual, multimodal systems.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在大型语言模型中保护数据隐私的方法，重点介绍了领域无关的NLP任务中的预处理技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐私是基本人权，但大型语言模型需要大量数据，其中可能包含私人信息，因此匿名化至关重要。

Method: 研究了几种预处理方法，用于掩码或伪匿名化文本数据中的私人信息。

Result: 虽然完全匿名化可能不可行，但提出了可行的预处理技术。

Conclusion: 报告强调了在NLP任务中保护隐私的重要性，并提供了实用的预处理方法。

Abstract: Privacy is a fundamental human right. Data privacy is protected by different
regulations, such as GDPR. However, modern large language models require a huge
amount of data to learn linguistic variations, and the data often contains
private information. Research has shown that it is possible to extract private
information from such language models. Thus, anonymizing such private and
sensitive information is of utmost importance. While complete anonymization may
not be possible, a number of different pre-processing approaches exist for
masking or pseudonymizing private information in textual data. This report
focuses on a few of such approaches for domain-agnostic NLP tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨结构探针在句法表征中是否受结构和统计因素的系统性影响。

Method: 在三个受控基准上对结构探针进行深入分析。

Result: 结构探针存在距离偏差、对深层句法结构表示不佳，且受干扰因素影响，但不受单词预测性影响。

Conclusion: 揭示了结构探针的当前挑战，并提供了受控基准以改进评估。

Abstract: The syntactic structures of sentences can be readily read-out from the
activations of large language models (LLMs). However, the ``structural probes''
that have been developed to reveal this phenomenon are typically evaluated on
an indiscriminate set of sentences. Consequently, it remains unclear whether
structural and/or statistical factors systematically affect these syntactic
representations. To address this issue, we conduct an in-depth analysis of
structural probes on three controlled benchmarks. Our results are three-fold.
First, structural probes are biased by a superficial property: the closer two
words are in a sentence, the more likely structural probes will consider them
as syntactically linked. Second, structural probes are challenged by linguistic
properties: they poorly represent deep syntactic structures, and get interfered
by interacting nouns or ungrammatical verb forms. Third, structural probes do
not appear to be affected by the predictability of individual words. Overall,
this work sheds light on the current challenges faced by structural probes.
Providing a benchmark made of controlled stimuli to better evaluate their
performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，通用大型语言模型（LLMs）在心理健康应用中缺乏文化敏感性和文化意识，难以准确反映东西方抑郁症状的文化差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能复现临床心理学中观察到的文化差异，即西方人倾向于报告心理症状，而东方人倾向于报告躯体症状。

Method: 通过用西方或东方角色提示LLMs，测试其在英语和主要东方语言（如中文、日语和印地语）中的表现。

Result: LLMs在英语提示下未能复现文化差异，但在东方语言提示下部分改善；模型对文化角色的低敏感性和文化不变的症状层级是主要原因。

Conclusion: 当前通用LLMs缺乏文化感知能力，限制了其在心理健康应用中的安全性和有效性。

Abstract: Prior clinical psychology research shows that Western individuals with
depression tend to report psychological symptoms, while Eastern individuals
report somatic ones. We test whether Large Language Models (LLMs), which are
increasingly used in mental health, reproduce these cultural patterns by
prompting them with Western or Eastern personas. Results show that LLMs largely
fail to replicate the patterns when prompted in English, though prompting in
major Eastern languages (i.e., Chinese, Japanese, and Hindi) improves alignment
in several configurations. Our analysis pinpoints two key reasons for this
failure: the models' low sensitivity to cultural personas and a strong,
culturally invariant symptom hierarchy that overrides cultural cues. These
findings reveal that while prompt language is important, current
general-purpose LLMs lack the robust, culture-aware capabilities essential for
safe and effective mental health applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RooseBERT的预训练语言模型，专门用于政治话语分析，以解决政治语言和辩论的复杂性对通用语言模型的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 政治辩论和讨论的增加需要新的计算方法来自动分析内容，以促进公民的政治审议。政治语言的特殊性和辩论的论证形式（如隐含策略和论点）使得任务极具挑战性。

Method: 通过在大规模政治辩论和演讲语料库（8K辩论）上预训练RooseBERT，并在四个下游任务（命名实体识别、情感分析、论点组件检测与分类、论点关系预测与分类）上微调。

Result: RooseBERT在四个任务上显著优于通用语言模型，表明领域特定预训练能提升政治辩论分析性能。

Conclusion: RooseBERT为政治话语分析提供了有效的工具，并已向研究社区发布。

Abstract: The increasing amount of political debates and politics-related discussions
calls for the definition of novel computational methods to automatically
analyse such content with the final goal of lightening up political
deliberation to citizens. However, the specificity of the political language
and the argumentative form of these debates (employing hidden communication
strategies and leveraging implicit arguments) make this task very challenging,
even for current general-purpose pre-trained Language Models. To address this
issue, we introduce a novel pre-trained Language Model for political discourse
language called RooseBERT. Pre-training a language model on a specialised
domain presents different technical and linguistic challenges, requiring
extensive computational resources and large-scale data. RooseBERT has been
trained on large political debate and speech corpora (8K debates, each composed
of several sub-debates on different topics) in English. To evaluate its
performances, we fine-tuned it on four downstream tasks related to political
debate analysis, i.e., named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, argument
component detection and classification, and argument relation prediction and
classification. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over
general-purpose Language Models on these four tasks, highlighting how
domain-specific pre-training enhances performance in political debate analysis.
We release the RooseBERT language model for the research community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种稳定性-可塑性权衡（SPT）方法，用于持续命名实体识别（CNER），通过表示和权重视角平衡新旧知识，解决了现有方法过度稳定但缺乏可塑性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNER方法主要依赖知识蒸馏（KD）来防止灾难性遗忘，但导致模型过度稳定而缺乏可塑性。本文旨在通过SPT方法平衡这两者。

Method: SPT方法从表示视角引入池化操作增强可塑性，从权重视角动态合并新旧模型权重，并采用权重引导的选择机制和基于置信度的伪标签方法处理非实体类型的语义偏移。

Result: 在三个基准数据集的十个CNER设置中，SPT方法优于现有方法，证明了其在稳定性与可塑性权衡上的有效性。

Conclusion: SPT方法成功解决了CNER中稳定性与可塑性的平衡问题，为持续学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Continual Named Entity Recognition (CNER) is an evolving field that focuses
on sequentially updating an existing model to incorporate new entity types.
Previous CNER methods primarily utilize Knowledge Distillation (KD) to preserve
prior knowledge and overcome catastrophic forgetting, strictly ensuring that
the representations of old and new models remain consistent. Consequently, they
often impart the model with excessive stability (i.e., retention of old
knowledge) but limited plasticity (i.e., acquisition of new knowledge). To
address this issue, we propose a Stability-Plasticity Trade-off (SPT) method
for CNER that balances these aspects from both representation and weight
perspectives. From the representation perspective, we introduce a pooling
operation into the original KD, permitting a level of plasticity by
consolidating representation dimensions. From the weight perspective, we
dynamically merge the weights of old and new models, strengthening old
knowledge while maintaining new knowledge. During this fusion, we implement a
weight-guided selective mechanism to prioritize significant weights. Moreover,
we develop a confidence-based pseudo-labeling approach for the current
non-entity type, which predicts entity types using the old model to handle the
semantic shift of the non-entity type, a challenge specific to CNER that has
largely been ignored by previous methods. Extensive experiments across ten CNER
settings on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our SPT method surpasses
previous CNER approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in achieving a
suitable stability-plasticity trade-off.

Motivation: 现有研究多依赖虚构人物，本研究填补了使用真实人类数据评估LLMs的空白。

Method: 通过522名韩国参与者的PWYW定价实验，比较三种多模态LLMs的表现，分析人物信息注入方法的影响。

Result: LLMs在个体层面预测不准确，但能反映群体行为趋势；提示技术改进效果有限。

Conclusion: 研究为计算社会科学中基于人物的模拟提供了实证指导，首次全面评估了LLMs在真实人类数据上的经济行为模拟能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have generated significant
interest in their capacity to simulate human-like behaviors, yet most studies
rely on fictional personas rather than actual human data. We address this
limitation by evaluating LLMs' ability to predict individual economic
decision-making using Pay-What-You-Want (PWYW) pricing experiments with real
522 human personas. Our study systematically compares three state-of-the-art
multimodal LLMs using detailed persona information from 522 Korean participants
in cultural consumption scenarios. We investigate whether LLMs can accurately
replicate individual human choices and how persona injection methods affect
prediction performance. Results reveal that while LLMs struggle with precise
individual-level predictions, they demonstrate reasonable group-level
behavioral tendencies. Also, we found that commonly adopted prompting
techniques are not much better than naive prompting methods; reconstruction of
personal narrative nor retrieval augmented generation have no significant gain
against simple prompting method. We believe that these findings can provide the
first comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' capabilities on simulating economic
behavior using real human data, offering empirical guidance for persona-based
simulation in computational social science.

Conclusion: LECTOR为智能辅导系统和自适应学习平台提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Spaced repetition systems are fundamental to efficient learning and memory
retention, but existing algorithms often struggle with semantic interference
and personalized adaptation. We present LECTOR (\textbf{L}LM-\textbf{E}nhanced
\textbf{C}oncept-based \textbf{T}est-\textbf{O}riented \textbf{R}epetition), a
novel adaptive scheduling algorithm specifically designed for test-oriented
learning scenarios, particularly language examinations where success rate is
paramount. LECTOR leverages large language models for semantic analysis while
incorporating personalized learning profiles, addressing the critical challenge
of semantic confusion in vocabulary learning by utilizing LLM-powered semantic
similarity assessment and integrating it with established spaced repetition
principles. Our comprehensive evaluation against six baseline algorithms
(SSP-MMC, SM2, HLR, FSRS, ANKI, THRESHOLD) across 100 simulated learners over
100 days demonstrates significant improvements: LECTOR achieves a 90.2\%
success rate compared to 88.4\% for the best baseline (SSP-MMC), representing a
2.0\% relative improvement. The algorithm shows particular strength in handling
semantically similar concepts, reducing confusion-induced errors while
maintaining computational efficiency. Our results establish LECTOR as a
promising direction for intelligent tutoring systems and adaptive learning
platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在语言使用上是否与人类相似，特别是语言趋同这一核心语用现象。

Method: 通过比较16种语言模型、3个对话语料库和多种风格特征，分析模型对用户语言模式的适应性。

Result: 模型显著趋同于对话风格，但存在过度适应；指令调优和大模型趋同程度较低。

Conclusion: 模型与人类的语言趋同机制可能不同，需进一步研究其底层机制。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are generally considered proficient in
generating language, how similar their language usage is to that of humans
remains understudied. In this paper, we test whether models exhibit linguistic
convergence, a core pragmatic element of human language communication, asking:
do models adapt, or converge, to the linguistic patterns of their user? To
answer this, we systematically compare model completions of exisiting dialogues
to the original human responses across sixteen language models, three dialogue
corpora, and a variety of stylometric features. We find that models strongly
converge to the conversation's style, often significantly overfitting relative
to the human baseline. While convergence patterns are often feature-specific,
we observe consistent shifts in convergence across modeling settings, with
instruction-tuned and larger models converging less than their pretrained
counterparts. Given the differences between human and model convergence
patterns, we hypothesize that the underlying mechanisms for these behaviors are
very different.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs广泛应用，其可能放大性别偏见的问题引起关注。现有研究多关注显性偏见，忽略了生成内容中的隐性偏见。

Method: 使用心理学中的性别刻板印象（如攻击性或八卦）构建开放叙事任务，并引入新数据集StereoBias-Stories进行分析。

Result: 发现模型在无条件提示下偏向男性，独立属性可缓解偏见；多属性组合会强化刻板印象；模型偏见与心理学分类一致且随模型规模增强。

Conclusion: 强调了基于心理学评估LLMs的重要性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used across different
applications, concerns about their potential to amplify gender biases in
various tasks are rising. Prior research has often probed gender bias using
explicit gender cues as counterfactual, or studied them in sentence completion
and short question answering tasks. These formats might overlook more implicit
forms of bias embedded in generative behavior of longer content. In this work,
we investigate gender bias in LLMs using gender stereotypes studied in
psychology (e.g., aggressiveness or gossiping) in an open-ended task of
narrative generation. We introduce a novel dataset called StereoBias-Stories
containing short stories either unconditioned or conditioned on (one, two, or
six) random attributes from 25 psychological stereotypes and three task-related
story endings. We analyze how the gender contribution in the overall story
changes in response to these attributes and present three key findings: (1)
While models, on average, are highly biased towards male in unconditioned
prompts, conditioning on attributes independent from gender stereotypes
mitigates this bias. (2) Combining multiple attributes associated with the same
gender stereotype intensifies model behavior, with male ones amplifying bias
and female ones alleviating it. (3) Model biases align with psychological
ground-truth used for categorization, and alignment strength increases with
model size. Together, these insights highlight the importance of
psychology-grounded evaluation of LLMs.

Result: LLM在监督学习设置下表现优于教授，仅需42个训练样本即可取得更好结果。

Conclusion: 利用LLM不确定性的监督学习可帮助教授更准确地估计考题难度，提升考试质量。

Abstract: Estimating the difficulty of exam questions is essential for developing good
exams, but professors are not always good at this task. We compare various
Large Language Model-based methods with three professors in their ability to
estimate what percentage of students will give correct answers on True/False
exam questions in the areas of Neural Networks and Machine Learning. Our
results show that the professors have limited ability to distinguish between
easy and difficult questions and that they are outperformed by directly asking
Gemini 2.5 to solve this task. Yet, we obtained even better results using
uncertainties of the LLMs solving the questions in a supervised learning
setting, using only 42 training samples. We conclude that supervised learning
using LLM uncertainty can help professors better estimate the difficulty of
exam questions, improving the quality of assessment.

Motivation: 当前内容审核系统依赖噪声标签学习，缺乏与审核规则的对齐，决策不透明，难以支持人工审查。

Method: Hi-Guard采用分层审核流程和分层分类法，结合规则定义到模型提示中，并使用多级软边际奖励和GRPO优化。

Result: 实验和实际部署表明，Hi-Guard在分类准确性、泛化能力和可解释性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: Hi-Guard为可扩展、透明且可信的内容安全系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: Social platforms have revolutionized information sharing, but also
accelerated the dissemination of harmful and policy-violating content. To
ensure safety and compliance at scale, moderation systems must go beyond
efficiency and offer accuracy and interpretability. However, current approaches
largely rely on noisy, label-driven learning, lacking alignment with moderation
rules and producing opaque decisions that hinder human review. Therefore, we
propose Hierarchical Guard (Hi-Guard), a multimodal moderation framework that
introduces a new policy-aligned decision paradigm. The term "Hierarchical"
reflects two key aspects of our system design: (1) a hierarchical moderation
pipeline, where a lightweight binary model first filters safe content and a
stronger model handles fine-grained risk classification; and (2) a hierarchical
taxonomy in the second stage, where the model performs path-based
classification over a hierarchical taxonomy ranging from coarse to fine-grained
levels. To ensure alignment with evolving moderation policies, Hi-Guard
directly incorporates rule definitions into the model prompt. To further
enhance structured prediction and reasoning, we introduce a multi-level
soft-margin reward and optimize with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
penalizing semantically adjacent misclassifications and improving explanation
quality. Extensive experiments and real-world deployment demonstrate that
Hi-Guard achieves superior classification accuracy, generalization, and
interpretability, paving the way toward scalable, transparent, and trustworthy
content safety systems. Code is available at:

Motivation: 现有单智能体测试时间扩展方法（如Best-of-N和Self-Consistency）受限于单智能体的能力上限，而多智能体协作方法可能突破这一限制。

Method: 设计了三种CTTS范式（SA-MR、MA-SR、MA-MR），并提出CTTS-MM框架，结合Agent Collaboration Search（ACS）和Mixture of Reward Models（MoR）优化协作。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a promising research field for
enhancing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) without extra

(STTS) paradigm. On the other hand, recent works demonstrate that
collective-agent methods can break through the upper bound of single-agent
systems by orchestrating diverse models. Thus, in this paper, we take a first
step towards exploring Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS). Consider the
different interaction types of single and multiple models, we design three
primary paradigms to investigate the optimal paradigm of CTTS: (1) single agent
to multiple reward models (SA-MR); (2) multiple agents to single reward model
(MA-SR); and (3) multiple agents to multiple reward models (MA-MR). Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MA-MR consistently achieves the best performance.
Based on this, we propose a novel framework named CTTS-MM that effectively
leverages both multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaboration for enhanced
inference. Specifically, for multi-agent collaboration, we propose an Agent
Collaboration Search (ACS), which searches for the most effective combination
of LLM agents from a large candidate pool; for multi-reward-model
collaboration, we propose Mixture of Reword Models (MoR), which consists of a
curated question pool and a Prior Reward model Ensemble Selection (PRES) to
select the optimal combinations of reward models via Pair-wise Reward Ranking
(PRR) metric. Experiments across seven mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that
the proposed CTTS-MM consistently obtains superior performance. Code will be
released at https://github.com/magent4aci/CTTS-MM.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Taggus的管道，用于从葡萄牙语文学作品中提取社交网络，其性能优于现有工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在构建角色社交网络时表现不佳，尤其是在小语种中缺乏标注数据。

Method: 结合POS标记和启发式方法，提出Taggus管道。

Result: 在角色识别和共指消解任务中F1得分为94.1%，交互检测为75.9%，分别比现有工具提升50.7%和22.3%。

Conclusion: Taggus在葡萄牙语中表现优异，未来可改进角色关系检测。管道已公开以促进发展。

Abstract: Automatically identifying characters and their interactions from fiction
books is, arguably, a complex task that requires pipelines that leverage
multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, such as Named Entity
Recognition (NER) and Part-of-speech (POS) tagging. However, these methods are
not optimized for the task that leads to the construction of Social Networks of
Characters. Indeed, the currently available methods tend to underperform,
especially in less-represented languages, due to a lack of manually annotated
data for training. Here, we propose a pipeline, which we call Taggus, to
extract social networks from literary fiction works in Portuguese. Our results
show that compared to readily available State-of-the-Art tools -- off-the-shelf
NER tools and Large Language Models (ChatGPT) -- the resulting pipeline, which
uses POS tagging and a combination of heuristics, achieves satisfying results
with an average F1-Score of $94.1\%$ in the task of identifying characters and
solving for co-reference and $75.9\%$ in interaction detection. These
represent, respectively, an increase of $50.7\%$ and $22.3\%$ on results
achieved by the readily available State-of-the-Art tools. Further steps to
improve results are outlined, such as solutions for detecting relationships
between characters. Limitations on the size and scope of our testing samples
are acknowledged. The Taggus pipeline is publicly available to encourage
development in this field for the Portuguese language.2

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的上下文学习方法JointThinking，通过结合Thinking和Nothinking两种推理模式的差异，显著提高了推理准确性，并在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注大型语言模型的训练和推理策略，但其在上下文学习（ICL）中的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出JointThinking方法，通过并行生成Thinking和Nothinking模式的答案，并在不一致时触发第二轮推理。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中显著优于少样本思维链（CoT）和多数投票方法，且与基于训练的最优方法性能相当。

Conclusion: JointThinking展示了结构思维多样性的价值，并具有强扩展性，为未来ICL研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Reasoning large language models (RLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities through structured and multi-step reasoning. While prior research
has primarily focused on improving their training and inference strategies,
their potential for in-context learning (ICL) remains largely underexplored. To
fill this gap, we propose Thinking with Nothinking Calibration (JointThinking),
a new ICL paradigm that leverages the structured difference between two
reasoning modes, i.e., Thinking and Nothinking, to improve reasoning accuracy.
Specifically, our method prompts the model to generate two answers in parallel:
one in Thinking mode and the other in Nothinking mode. A second round of
Thinking is triggered only when the two initial responses are inconsistent,
using a single prompt that incorporates the original question and both
candidate answers. Since such disagreement occurs infrequently (e.g., only 6\%
in GSM8K), our method performs just one round of reasoning in most cases,
resulting in minimal latency overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that JointThinking significantly outperforms
few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) and majority voting with improved answer
robustness. Moreover, It achieves comparable in-distribution performance to
training-based SOTA method, while substantially outperforming on
out-of-distribution tasks. We further conduct a systematic analysis of the
calibration mechanism, showing that leveraging different reasoning modes
consistently lowers the error rate and highlights the value of structural
thinking diversity. Additionally, we observe that the performance gap between
actual and ideal reasoning narrows as model size increases in the second round
of thinking, indicating the strong scalability of our approach. Finally, we
discuss current limitations and outline promising directions for future ICL
research in RLLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出ReDSM5，一个基于Reddit帖子的数据集，通过专家标注句子级别的抑郁症状，结合DSM-5标准，提升抑郁检测的临床相关性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统抑郁检测方法缺乏与DSM-5标准的关联，限制了临床实用性和可解释性。

Method: 构建ReDSM5数据集，包含1484篇帖子，由心理学家标注句子级别的抑郁症状和临床依据。

Result: 分析了语言模式，建立了症状分类和解释生成的基准。

Conclusion: ReDSM5为抑郁检测和解释性研究提供了新资源，推动了模型的可解释性发展。

Abstract: Depression is a pervasive mental health condition that affects hundreds of
millions of individuals worldwide, yet many cases remain undiagnosed due to
barriers in traditional clinical access and pervasive stigma. Social media
platforms, and Reddit in particular, offer rich, user-generated narratives that
can reveal early signs of depressive symptomatology. However, existing
computational approaches often label entire posts simply as depressed or not
depressed, without linking language to specific criteria from the DSM-5, the
standard clinical framework for diagnosing depression. This limits both
clinical relevance and interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce
ReDSM5, a novel Reddit corpus comprising 1484 long-form posts, each
exhaustively annotated at the sentence level by a licensed psychologist for the
nine DSM-5 depression symptoms. For each label, the annotator also provides a
concise clinical rationale grounded in DSM-5 methodology. We conduct an
exploratory analysis of the collection, examining lexical, syntactic, and
emotional patterns that characterize symptom expression in social media
narratives. Compared to prior resources, ReDSM5 uniquely combines
symptom-specific supervision with expert explanations, facilitating the
development of models that not only detect depression but also generate
human-interpretable reasoning. We establish baseline benchmarks for both
multi-label symptom classification and explanation generation, providing
reference results for future research on detection and interpretability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MISDER的动态环境表示框架，用于检测社交媒体上的虚假信息，解决了传统静态学习范式的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚假信息在社交媒体上的传播对社会产生了负面影响，而现有的虚假信息检测方法通常基于静态假设，无法适应动态变化的社交环境。

Method: MISDER通过学习每个时间段的社会环境表示，并利用时序模型（LSTM、连续动态方程和预训练动态系统）预测未来表示，提出了三种变体：MISDER-LSTM、MISDER-ODE和MISDER-PT。

Result: 实验结果表明，MISDER在两种流行数据集上优于多种基线方法，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: MISDER通过动态环境表示解决了虚假信息检测中的动态性问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation across diverse social media platforms has
drawn significant attention from both academic and industrial communities due
to its detrimental effects. Accordingly, automatically distinguishing
misinformation, dubbed as Misinformation Detection (MD), has become an
increasingly active research topic. The mainstream methods formulate MD as a
static learning paradigm, which learns the mapping between the content, links,
and propagation of news articles and the corresponding manual veracity labels.
However, the static assumption is often violated, since in real-world
scenarios, the veracity of news articles may vacillate within the dynamically
evolving social environment. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel
framework, namely Misinformation detection with Dynamic Environmental
Representations (MISDER). The basic idea of MISDER lies in learning a social
environmental representation for each period and employing a temporal model to
predict the representation for future periods. In this work, we specify the
temporal model as the LSTM model, continuous dynamics equation, and pre-trained
dynamics system, suggesting three variants of MISDER, namely MISDER-LSTM,
MISDER-ODE, and MISDER-PT, respectively. To evaluate the performance of MISDER,
we compare it to various MD baselines across 2 prevalent datasets, and the
experimental results can indicate the effectiveness of our proposed model.

Motivation: 现有推理模型依赖离散标记，限制了表达能力。研究旨在通过软标记和连续概念空间增强LLMs的推理能力。

Method: 使用探测技术分析LLMs内部行为，并探索随机性策略（如Dirichlet重采样和Gumbel-Softmax技巧）以改进软思考。

Result: 实验表明，引入随机性（尤其是Gumbel-Softmax技巧）能有效缓解局限性，在八个推理基准中表现优异。

Conclusion: 随机性策略能释放软思考潜力，Gumbel-Softmax技巧因其可控平滑性表现最佳。

Abstract: Human cognition naturally engages with abstract and fluid concepts, whereas
existing reasoning models often rely on generating discrete tokens, potentially
constraining their expressive capabilities. Recent advancements aim to address
this limitation by enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate soft,
abstract tokens, thus facilitating reasoning within a continuous concept space.
This paper explores the `Soft Thinking' capabilities of various LLMs by
examining the models' internal behavior using a suite of probing techniques.
Contrary to the common belief that Soft Thinking enables the simultaneous
exploration of diverse reasoning paths, our findings reveal that LLMs
predominantly rely on the most influential component of the soft inputs during
subsequent decoding steps. This reliance hinders the exploration of different
reasoning paths and reduces vanilla Soft Thinking to a form of greedy decoding,
obscuring the advantage of transmitting more information through Soft Tokens.
To tackle this issue, we explore sampling strategies to introduce
\emph{randomness}, employing methods such as Dirichlet resampling and the
Gumbel-Softmax trick. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating randomness
can alleviate the limitations of vanilla approaches and unleash the potential
of Soft Thinking. Notably, the Gumbel-Softmax trick provides adequate
randomness with controlled smoothness, resulting in superior performance across
eight reasoning benchmarks.

Method: 系统比较裁剪和基于dropout的增强策略，使用MTEB和领域内评估指标衡量嵌入质量。

Result: 裁剪方法显著优于dropout，领域内数据接近监督SOTA，领域外数据表现较差；微调仅需最后几层即可达到类似效果。

Conclusion: 自监督微调在领域内数据上高效且接近监督SOTA，裁剪是更优的增强策略，最后几层对嵌入质量至关重要。

Abstract: Text embeddings, i.e. vector representations of entire texts, play an
important role in many NLP applications, such as retrieval-augmented
generation, sentiment analysis, clustering, or visualizing collections of texts
for data exploration. Currently, top-performing embedding models are derived
from pre-trained language models via extensive supervised fine-tuning using
curated text pairs. This contrasts with computer vision, where self-supervised
training based on data augmentations has demonstrated remarkable success. Here
we systematically compare the two most well-known augmentation strategies for
positive pair generation in contrastive learning of text embeddings. We assess
embedding quality on MTEB and additional in-domain evaluations and show that
cropping augmentation strongly outperforms the dropout-based approach. We find
that on out-of-domain data, the quality of resulting embeddings is below the
supervised SOTA models, but for in-domain data, self-supervised fine-tuning
produces high-quality text embeddings after very short fine-tuning, sometimes
only marginally below the supervised SOTA. Finally, we show that representation
quality increases towards the last transformer layers, which undergo the
largest change during fine-tuning; and that fine-tuning only those last layers
is sufficient to reach similar embedding quality.

Conclusion: CarbonPDF为解决非结构化PDF报告中的碳足迹问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Product sustainability reports provide valuable insights into the
environmental impacts of a product and are often distributed in PDF format.
These reports often include a combination of tables and text, which complicates
their analysis. The lack of standardization and the variability in reporting
formats further exacerbate the difficulty of extracting and interpreting
relevant information from large volumes of documents. In this paper, we tackle
the challenge of answering questions related to carbon footprints within
sustainability reports available in PDF format. Unlike previous approaches, our
focus is on addressing the difficulties posed by the unstructured and
inconsistent nature of text extracted from PDF parsing. To facilitate this
analysis, we introduce CarbonPDF-QA, an open-source dataset containing
question-answer pairs for 1735 product report documents, along with
human-annotated answers. Our analysis shows that GPT-4o struggles to answer
questions with data inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we propose
CarbonPDF, an LLM-based technique specifically designed to answer carbon
footprint questions on such datasets. We develop CarbonPDF by fine-tuning Llama
3 with our training data. Our results show that our technique outperforms
current state-of-the-art techniques, including question-answering (QA) systems
finetuned on table and text data.

Conclusion: UPLME在共情检测中有效处理标签噪声，性能优于现有方法，尤其在不确定性量化方面表现突出。

Abstract: Supervised learning for empathy regression is challenged by noisy
self-reported empathy scores. While many algorithms have been proposed for
learning with noisy labels in textual classification problems, the regression
counterpart is relatively under-explored. We propose UPLME, an
uncertainty-aware probabilistic language modelling framework to capture label
noise in the regression setting of empathy detection. UPLME includes a
probabilistic language model that predicts both empathy score and
heteroscedastic uncertainty and is trained using Bayesian concepts with
variational model ensembling. We further introduce two novel loss components:
one penalises degenerate Uncertainty Quantification (UQ), and another enforces
the similarity between the input pairs on which we predict empathy. UPLME
provides state-of-the-art performance (Pearson Correlation Coefficient:
$0.558\rightarrow0.580$ and $0.629\rightarrow0.634$) in terms of the
performance reported in the literature in two public benchmarks, having label
noise. Through synthetic label noise injection, we show that UPLME is effective
in separating noisy and clean samples based on the predicted uncertainty. UPLME
further outperform (Calibration error: $0.571\rightarrow0.376$) a recent
variational model ensembling-based UQ method designed for regression problems.

Method: 设计FilBench基准测试，涵盖文化知识、传统NLP、阅读理解和生成等任务，评估27种先进LLM。

Result: LLM在阅读理解和翻译任务上表现不佳，GPT-4o得分最高（72.23%），专门针对东南亚语言的模型表现更差（SEA-LION v3 70B得分61.07%）。

Conclusion: FilBench有助于推动菲律宾语言的NLP研究，并促进LLM开发中对菲律宾语言的更多关注。

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of LLMs on English-based tasks, little is
known about their capabilities in specific languages such as Filipino. In this
work, we address this gap by introducing FilBench, a Filipino-centric benchmark
designed to evaluate LLMs across a diverse set of tasks and capabilities in
Filipino, Tagalog, and Cebuano. We carefully curate the tasks in FilBench to
reflect the priorities and trends of NLP research in the Philippines such as
Cultural Knowledge, Classical NLP, Reading Comprehension, and Generation. By
evaluating 27 state-of-the-art LLMs on FilBench, we find that several LLMs
suffer from reading comprehension and translation capabilities. Our results
indicate that FilBench is challenging, with the best model, GPT-4o, achieving
only a score of 72.23%. Moreover, we also find that models trained specifically
for Southeast Asian languages tend to underperform on FilBench, with the
highest-performing model, SEA-LION v3 70B, achieving only a score of 61.07%.
Our work demonstrates the value of curating language-specific LLM benchmarks to
aid in driving progress on Filipino NLP and increasing the inclusion of
Philippine languages in LLM development.

integrate the terminology into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.
Experiments show substantial improvements in the accuracy and domain-specific

Motivation: 当前基于离散提示工程或连续参数调整的方法在精度和复杂性上存在不足，EmbedGrad旨在通过梯度优化嵌入实现更精细的任务适应。

Method: EmbedGrad通过梯度优化调整文本提示嵌入，训练与推理阶段解耦，优化嵌入保留语义并直接应用于用户查询。

Result: 在数学推理、情感分析和因果判断任务中，EmbedGrad显著提升了模型性能，例如数学问题准确率从14.74%提升至58.96%。

Conclusion: EmbedGrad为任务适应提供了新范式，结合了提示工程和参数效率的优势，无需架构修改即可实现性能提升。

Abstract: Effectively adapting powerful pretrained foundation models to diverse tasks
remains a key challenge in AI deployment. Current approaches primarily follow
two paradigms:discrete optimization of text prompts through prompt engineering,
or continuous adaptation via additional trainable parameters. Both exhibit
limitations-discrete methods lack refinement precision while parameter-based
techniques increase complexity and reduce interpretability. To address these
constraints, we propose EmbedGrad, a novel framework that optimizes text prompt
embeddings through gradient-based refinement. Our approach uniquely decouples
training from deployment:during optimization,labeled examples guide precise
embedding adjustments while preserving semantic meaning; during inference, only
optimized embeddings integrate with user queries. This enables fine-grained
calibration impossible in text space, such as enhancing the reasoning
capability of prompts like please reason step by step. Comprehensive
evaluations across mathematical reasoning, sentiment analysis, and causal
judgment tasks demonstrate EmbedGrad's effectiveness:optimizing this reasoning
prompt for Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B increased accuracy from 14.74\% to 58.96\% on
mathematical problems. Consistent improvements were observed across model
scales (0.5B-14B) and all tasks, with particularly significant gains for
smaller models on complex problems like causal judgment. By bridging prompt
engineering and parameter efficiency without architectural changes, our work
establishes embedding refinement as a powerful new paradigm for task
adaptation.

Conclusion: LAGER通过跨层信息互补，显著提升LLM作为评判者的对齐性，适用于数据选择和情感理解等下游任务。

Abstract: The growing scale of evaluation tasks has led to the widespread adoption of
automated evaluation using large language models, a paradigm known as
"LLMas-a-judge." However, improving its alignment with human preferences
without complex prompts or fine-tuning remains challenging. In this work,
motivated by preliminary findings that middle-to-upper layers encode
semantically and taskrelevant representations that are often more aligned with
human judgments than the final layer, we propose LAGER, a lightweight and
efficient framework for enhancing LLM-as-a-Judge alignment with human scoring,
via internal representations. LAGER produces fine-grained judgment scores by
aggregating cross-layer scoretoken logits and computing the expected score from
a softmax-based distribution, with the LLM backbone kept frozen. LAGER fully
leverages the complementary information across different layers, overcoming the
limitations of relying solely on the final layer. We evaluate our method on the
standard alignment benchmarks Flask, HelpSteer, and BIGGen using Spearman
correlation, and find that LAGER achieves improvements of up to 7.5% over the
best baseline across these benchmarks. Without reasoning steps, LAGER matches
or outperforms reasoning-based methods. Experiments on downstream applications,
such as data selection and emotional understanding, further show the
effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from performance degradation when

a novel continual learning framework that integrates dynamic knowledge graphs

retention of previously acquired knowledge. We pretrain our model on
WikiText-103 and evaluate sequential adaptation across four diverse target
domains: BioASQ, SciQ, TweetEval, and MIND. Our experiments demonstrate that
KILO consistently outperforms strong baselines, including continual
fine-tuning, ERNIE 2.0, and CPT, in terms of backward transfer, forward
transfer, F1 score, retention rate, and training efficiency. These results
highlight the effectiveness of combining structured knowledge retrieval and
instruction prompting to overcome domain shift challenges in continual learning

TL;DR: Double-Bench是一个多语言、多模态的大规模评估系统，用于全面评估文档RAG系统的各个组件，填补了现有基准的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准对文档RAG系统的评估不足，使用合成数据且缺乏完整的地面真实性和证据标签，无法反映真实世界的挑战。

Method: 开发了包含3,276份文档（72,880页）和5,168个单跳和多跳查询的Double-Bench，支持6种语言和4种文档类型，并动态更新以防止数据污染。

Result: 实验显示文本和视觉嵌入模型的差距正在缩小，但现有文档RAG框架存在过度自信的问题。

Conclusion: Double-Bench为未来文档RAG系统的研究提供了严格的基础，并计划每年更新基准。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) show great promise for complex document understanding, yet their
development is critically hampered by inadequate evaluation. Current benchmarks
often focus on specific part of document RAG system and use synthetic data with
incomplete ground truth and evidence labels, therefore failing to reflect
real-world bottlenecks and challenges. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce Double-Bench: a new large-scale, multilingual, and multimodal
evaluation system that is able to produce fine-grained assessment to each
component within document RAG systems. It comprises 3,276 documents (72,880
pages) and 5,168 single- and multi-hop queries across 6 languages and 4
document types with streamlined dynamic update support for potential data
contamination issues. Queries are grounded in exhaustively scanned evidence
pages and verified by human experts to ensure maximum quality and completeness.
Our comprehensive experiments across 9 state-of-the-art embedding models, 4
MLLMs and 4 end-to-end document RAG frameworks demonstrate the gap between text
and visual embedding models is narrowing, highlighting the need in building
stronger document retrieval models. Our findings also reveal the
over-confidence dilemma within current document RAG frameworks that tend to
provide answer even without evidence support. We hope our fully open-source
Double-Bench provide a rigorous foundation for future research in advanced
document RAG systems. We plan to retrieve timely corpus and release new
benchmarks on an annual basis.

Motivation: 讽刺是一种复杂的语言现象，传统方法主要依赖文本，而多模态信息在讽刺分析中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出了一种结合深度对象提取和外部概念知识的无需训练框架，以提升模型在多模态讽刺检测和解释中的能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架在多个模型上有效提升了讽刺分析的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为多模态讽刺分析提供了新的解决方案，并展示了LVLMs在此领域的潜力。

Abstract: Sarcasm is a complex linguistic phenomenon that involves a disparity between
literal and intended meanings, making it challenging for sentiment analysis and
other emotion-sensitive tasks. While traditional sarcasm detection methods
primarily focus on text, recent approaches have incorporated multimodal
information. However, the application of Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs)
in Multimodal Sarcasm Analysis (MSA) remains underexplored. In this paper, we
evaluate LVLMs in MSA tasks, specifically focusing on Multimodal Sarcasm
Detection and Multimodal Sarcasm Explanation. Through comprehensive
experiments, we identify key limitations, such as insufficient visual
understanding and a lack of conceptual knowledge. To address these issues, we
propose a training-free framework that integrates in-depth object extraction
and external conceptual knowledge to improve the model's ability to interpret
and explain sarcasm in multimodal contexts. The experimental results on
multiple models show the effectiveness of our proposed framework. The code is
available at https://github.com/cp-cp/LVLM-MSA.

TL;DR: 论文提出CTR-Sink框架，通过行为级注意力汇聚点解决CTR预测中语义碎片化问题，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户行为序列与自然语言的结构差异导致语义碎片化，传统语言模型难以有效捕捉行为边界和关系。

Method: 引入行为级注意力汇聚点（sink tokens），结合推荐信号（如时间距离），设计两阶段训练策略和注意力汇聚机制。

Result: 在工业数据集和开源数据集（MovieLens、Kuairec）上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: CTR-Sink通过优化注意力机制，显著提升了CTR预测性能。

Abstract: Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, a core task in recommendation systems,
estimates user click likelihood using historical behavioral data. Modeling user
behavior sequences as text to leverage Language Models (LMs) for this task has
gained traction, owing to LMs' strong semantic understanding and contextual
modeling capabilities. However, a critical structural gap exists: user behavior
sequences consist of discrete actions connected by semantically empty
separators, differing fundamentally from the coherent natural language in LM
pre-training. This mismatch causes semantic fragmentation, where LM attention
scatters across irrelevant tokens instead of focusing on meaningful behavior
boundaries and inter-behavior relationships, degrading prediction performance.
To address this, we propose $\textit{CTR-Sink}$, a novel framework introducing
behavior-level attention sinks tailored for recommendation scenarios. Inspired
by attention sink theory, it constructs attention focus sinks and dynamically
regulates attention aggregation via external information. Specifically, we
insert sink tokens between consecutive behaviors, incorporating
recommendation-specific signals such as temporal distance to serve as stable
attention sinks. To enhance generality, we design a two-stage training strategy
that explicitly guides LM attention toward sink tokens and a attention sink
mechanism that amplifies inter-sink dependencies to better capture behavioral
correlations. Experiments on one industrial dataset and two open-source
datasets (MovieLens, Kuairec), alongside visualization results, validate the
method's effectiveness across scenarios.

Conclusion: FairLangProc有助于推动NLP公平性技术的普及和应用。

Abstract: The rise in usage of Large Language Models to near ubiquitousness in recent
years has risen societal concern about their applications in decision-making
contexts, such as organizational justice or healthcare. This, in turn, poses
questions about the fairness of these models in critical settings, which leads
to the developement of different procedures to address bias in Natural Language
Processing. Although many datasets, metrics and algorithms have been proposed
to measure and mitigate harmful prejudice in Natural Language Processing, their
implementation is diverse and far from centralized. As a response, this paper
presents FairLangProc, a comprehensive Python package providing a common
implementation of some of the more recent advances in fairness in Natural
Language Processing providing an interface compatible with the famous Hugging
Face transformers library, aiming to encourage the widespread use and
democratization of bias mitigation techniques. The implementation can be found

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在专业领域表现不佳的原因是缺乏领域知识还是提示细节不足。

Method: 引入PartialOrderEval，为代码生成基准提供从最小到最大详细程度的提示序列，并在HumanEval和ParEval上测试。

Result: 实验显示不同任务对提示的敏感度不同，明确I/O规范、边缘案例处理和逐步分解是关键改进因素。

Conclusion: 提示的详细程度显著影响LLMs在专业任务中的表现，优化提示设计可提升性能。

Abstract: State-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve high pass@1 on general
benchmarks like HumanEval but underperform on specialized suites such as
ParEval. Is this due to LLMs missing domain knowledge or insufficient prompt
detail is given? To answer this, we introduce PartialOrderEval, which augments
any code generation benchmark with a partial order of prompts from minimal to
maximally detailed. Applying it to HumanEval and both serial and OpenMP subsets
of ParEval, we measure how pass@1 scales with prompt specificity. Our
experiments with Llama-3.x and Qwen2.5-Coder demonstrate varying degrees of
prompt sensitivity across different tasks, and a qualitative analysis
highlights explicit I/O specifications, edge-case handling, and stepwise
breakdowns as the key drivers of prompt detail improvement.

Conclusion: CompassVerifier和VerifierBench将推动答案验证、评估协议和强化学习研究。

Abstract: Answer verification is crucial not only for evaluating large language models
(LLMs) by matching their unstructured outputs against standard answers, but
also serves as the reward model to guide LLM optimization. Most evaluation
frameworks rely on regularized matching or employ general LLMs for answer
verification, which demands extensive, repetitive customization for regex rules
or evaluation prompts. Two fundamental limitations persist in current
methodologies: 1) the absence of comprehensive benchmarks that systematically
evaluate verification capabilities across different LLMs; and 2) the nascent
stage of verifier development, where existing approaches lack both the
robustness to handle complex edge cases and the generalizability across
different domains. In this work, we develop CompassVerifier, an accurate and
robust lightweight verifier model for evaluation and outcome reward. It
demonstrates multi-domain competency spanning math, knowledge, and diverse
reasoning tasks, with the capability to process various answer types, including
multi-subproblems, formulas, and sequence answers, while effectively
identifying abnormal/invalid responses. We introduce VerifierBench benchmark
comprising model outputs collected from multiple data sources, augmented
through manual analysis of metaerror patterns to enhance CompassVerifier. We
anticipate that CompassVerifier and VerifierBench will facilitate answer
verification, evaluation protocols, and reinforcement learning research. Code

Result: 发动机位置显著影响尾迹饱和度和冰晶生长，稀释条件改变水汽供应，进而影响尾迹光学厚度。

Conclusion: 发动机位置和稀释条件对尾迹特性有重要影响，需在设计时综合考虑以减少环境影响。

Abstract: The present study investigates the impact of engine position on contrail
formation and near-field evolution in a realistic three-dimensional aircraft
configuration. Detailed numerical simulations are conducted using a
Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approach coupled with mesh adaptation
techniques. A Eulerian microphysical model is used to characterize contrail ice
crystal properties and their evolution under varying dilution conditions. The
setup is based on a Boeing 777-like geometry, including fuselage, wings,
engines, and tailplane. Two microphysical activation scenarios are considered:
one incorporating adsorption-based ice nucleation and the other assuming fully
activated soot particles. The latter for two soot number emission indices. The
dilution process and wake structure exhibit a strong dependence on engine
placement, which significantly influences plume saturation. In highly diluted
configurations, enhanced early-stage mixing reduces plume temperature and
increases relative humidity, favoring the growth of larger ice crystals.
Depending on the soot number concentration, vapor depletion effects may
outweigh dilution-driven changes in water vapor availability. In
adsorption-limited activation scenarios, increased dilution reduces the
concentration of sulfur species, leading to a lower activation fraction and the
formation of smaller ice crystals. Additionally, across the scenarios, the
modified jet-vortex interaction alters particle distribution and their access
to water vapor, further shaping their growth. These effects ultimately impact
the contrail's optical properties, particularly its optical thickness.

Abstract: Power loss mechanisms in large wind farms are complex due to the multiscale
nature of wind farm aerodynamics. Recent studies based on the two-scale
momentum theory have brought new insights into this field; however, most of
them have been limited to idealised wind farm scenarios. To better understand
the power performance of real wind farms, in this study we extend the framework
of the two-scale momentum theory to non-ideal turbine design and layout
scenarios, and then introduce simple analytical sub-models to account for the
associated power losses. These extensions provide a holistic view of how the
turbine design, layout, operating conditions and atmospheric conditions
collectively determine the amounts of different types of power losses in real
wind farms, including the losses due to turbine-wake interference (i.e.
`internal' power loss) and farm-atmosphere interaction (i.e. `external' power
loss). We also present a simple iterative method for calculating the optimal
farm induction factor that maximises the overall farm power for a given set of
conditions, including the atmospheric boundary layer height. Analogously to the
blade-element momentum theory playing a key role in wind turbine design
optimisation, the present theory is expected to play a key role in wind farm
design optimisation.

Abstract: In this current work, a comprehensive investigation into the impact dynamics
of superhydrophobic and lubricant-impregnated aluminium sphere balls on liquid
surfaces were carried out. The study delves into the hydrodynamic lubrication
behavior and the resulting phenomena during impact. The Worthington jet and
cavity associated give more insight into fundamental forces. The experimental
analysis and theoretical modeling suggest potential applications in various
fields such as fluid dynamics, tribology, and materials science. The stability
investigation on an aluminum-textured sphere ball is carried out, and the
evaluation of jet height and pinch-off phenomena is analyzed in detail. The
experiment on entrapped air on a superhydrophobic surface and the oil inside
the LIS for greater height was performed. The experimental setup involved a
carefully designed apparatus for impact analysis by utilizing high-speed
imaging techniques. Parameters such as impact velocity, Weber number, and
sphere diameter were systematically varied to understand their influence on the
observed dynamics. The lubricant viscosity is chosen such that it is comparable
to water viscosity. Furthermore, the study on Lubricant Impregnated Surfaces
(LIS) assessed frictional losses, i.e., drag reduction, compared to control and
textured surfaces. In conclusion, the valuable insights into the impact
dynamics advance our understanding of hydrodynamic lubrication and its
applications. The findings presented here underscore the importance of further
research in optimizing surface properties, selecting suitable lubricants, and
exploring broader applications in the fields of fluid dynamics, surface
engineering, and mechanical engineering.

Result: 速度场差异有限，但湍流强度预测差异显著，混合时间变化可达三倍。

Conclusion: MRF区域尺寸对模拟结果有显著影响，建议在RANS模拟中作为标准实践进行评估。

Abstract: A critical evaluation of the impact of the Multiple Reference Frame (MRF)
technique on steady RANS simulations of a Rushton turbine stirred-tanks is
presented. The analysis, based on the open source software OpenFOAM, is focused
on the choice of the diameter and thickness of the MRF region and on their
effect on the predicted velocity field and mixing times in the tank. Five
diameters of the MRF region are compared for the same operating conditions of
the turbine, showing limited differences in velocity profiles, which are found
in general good agreement with available experimental data. Significant
differences are nonetheless found in the predicted levels of turbulence
intensity within the tank, with a considerable amount of artificially generated
turbulence at the boundary of the MRF region for the largest diameters. The
impact of the different predictions of the turbulent field on the modeling of
the mixing process in the tank is evaluated by simulating the release of a
passive scalar, using the frozen-flow field hypothesis. The results show
changes in mixing times up to a factor of three when comparing MRF regions of
different size. Thus, the present investigation highlights the importance of
assessing the effect of the MRF zone size on numerical results as a standard
practice in RANS based simulations of stirred-tanks.

Abstract: The wall pressure is of great importance in understanding the forces and
structural responses induced by fluid. Recent works have investigated the
potential of deep learning techniques in predicting mean pressure coefficients
and fluctuating pressure coefficients, but most of existing deep learning
frameworks are limited to predicting a single snapshot using full spatial
information. To forecast spatiotemporal wall pressure of flow past a
rectangular cylinder, this study develops a physics-aware DeepU-Fourier neural
Network (DeepUFNet) deep learning model. DeepUFNet comprises the UNet structure
and the Fourier neural network, with physical high-frequency loss control
embedded in the model training stage to optimize model performance, where the
parameter $\beta$ varies with the development of the training epoch. Wind
tunnel testing is performed to collect wall pressures of a two-dimensional
rectangular cylinder with a side ratio of 1.5 at an angle of attack of zero
using high-frequency pressure scanning, thereby constructing a database for
DeepUFNet training and testing. The DeepUFNet model is found to forecast
spatiotemporal wall pressure information with high accuracy. The comparison
between forecast results and experimental data presents agreement in
statistical information, temporal pressure variation, power spectrum density,
spatial distribution, and spatiotemporal correlation. It is also found that
embedding a physical high-frequency loss control coefficient $\beta$ in the
DeepUFNet model can significantly improve model performance in forecasting
spatiotemporal wall pressure information, in particular, in forecasting
high-order frequency fluctuation and wall pressure variance. Furthermore, the
DeepUFNet extrapolation capability is tested with sparse spatial information
input, and the model presents a satisfactory extrapolation ability

Result: 发现该比例是区分流动区域和速度标度的关键参数，闭合关系能准确预测摩擦系数。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为工程应用中分层流动的压力损失量化提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST) is a cornerstone of atmospheric
science for describing turbulence in stable boundary layers. Extending MOST to
stably stratified turbulent channel flows, however, is non-trivial due to
confinement by solid walls and the much smaller turbulent length scales
involved. In this study, we investigate the applicability of MOST in closed
channels and identify where and to what extent the theory remains valid. A key
finding is that the ratio of the half-channel height to the Obukhov length
serves as a governing parameter for identifying distinct flow regions and
determining the scaling of the mean velocity within them. Hence, we propose a
closure relation to estimate this ratio directly from the governing input
parameters: friction Reynolds and friction Richardson numbers ($Re_{\tau}$ and
$Ri_{\tau}$). The framework is tested against a series of direct numerical
simulations (DNS) across a range of $Re_{\tau}$ and $Ri_{\tau}$. The
reconstructed velocity profiles enable accurate prediction of the skin friction
coefficient crucial for quantifying pressure losses in stratified flows in
engineering applications.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了非牛顿流体绕流中从周期性到复杂性的转变机制，强调了关键参数的作用。

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of elasticity and plasticity on
two-dimensional flow past a circular cylinder at Reynolds number $Re = 100$.
Ten direct numerical simulations were performed using the
Saramito-Herschel-Bulkley model to represent viscoelastic and
elastoviscoplastic (EVP) fluids. The flow evolves from a periodic von
K\'arm\'an vortex street to chaotic-like regimes. Proper Orthogonal
Decomposition (POD) and Higher Order Dynamic Mode Decomposition (HODMD) are
applied to extract dominant flow structures and their temporal dynamics. For
viscoelastic fluids, increasing the Weissenberg number $Wi$ elongates the
recirculation bubble and shifts it downstream, resulting in more intricate but
still periodic behavior. In EVP fluids, seven cases explore variations in
Bingham number Bn, solvent viscosity ratio $\beta_s$, and power law index n,
aiming to qualitatively assess their influence rather than determine critical
thresholds. Results indicate that stronger plastic effects, especially with
n>1, lead to increased flow complexity. Three dynamic regimes are identified:
(i) periodic; (ii) transitional, with elongated recirculation and disrupted
periodicity; and (iii) fully complex, with breakdown of recirculation. Overall,
the study highlights the interplay between inertia, elasticity, and yield
stress in non-Newtonian flows past obstacles and identifies key parameters
driving the transition from periodic to complex regimes.

Conclusion: 为可压缩湍流中相干结构与异常耗散的比较提供了初步研究基础。

Abstract: Anomalous dissipation, the persistence of a finite mean kinetic energy
dissipation as the Reynolds number tends to infinity, occurs in flows with
sufficiently spatially rough velocity fields. Compressible turbulence adds
further anomalous dissipation mechanisms, which we investigate in this work. To
this end, the Duchon-Robert framework (DR) for anomalous dissipation is
extended from the incompressible to the compressible Navier-Stokes flow case.
We obtain three integral dissipation terms, two anomalous and a viscous one,
which arise from the pressure-dilatation and density variations, differently
from the incompressible case. Subsequently, fully compressible one-dimensional
flows with traveling and mutually crossing shock waves are analysed in detail.
In such flows, DR reveals a local maximum of anomalous dissipation at the shock
front. Furthermore, DR is compared with a coarse-grain cascade theory of
compressible turbulence due to Aluie (AL) and the relevant dissipation flux
terms of both frameworks are identified and compared with each other. The
comparison shows that each contribution related to the compressibility effects
in DR has its analogue in AL. Finally, a piecewise linear shock-type velocity
profile, which approximates the crossing of two shock waves from the
simulations, is used for an analytical analysis of the anomalous dissipation
terms of DR to analyse the dependence of the terms on the local H\"older
exponent. Our work is a first step towards a comparison of coherent flow
structures in a compressible turbulent flow and related anomalous dissipation.

Result: 在固定动能且无涡度约束的特殊情况下，最优速度场处处与洛伦兹力的无散投影相反；一般情况下需数值求解PDE。

Conclusion: 变分法为优化速度场提供了优雅的数学框架，数值解可应用于更一般情况。

Abstract: We consider a variant of the kinematic dynamo problem. Rather than
prescribing a velocity field and searching for high-growth magnetic fields via
an eigenvalue problem, we treat the seed magnetic-field structure as given and
ask which velocity field maximally enhances its instantaneous growth. We show
this second problem has an elegant formulation in terms of variational
calculus. Upon simultaneously constraining the velocity's kinetic energy and
enstrophy, the Euler-Lagrange equation leads to a forced Helmholtz partial
differential equation (PDE) for the optimal velocity field. For the special
case of fixed kinetic energy and unconstrained enstrophy, the optimal velocity
field everywhere opposes the divergence-free projection of the Lorentz force.
In the more general setting, the optimal velocity field can be found through
numerical solution of the forced Helmholtz PDE.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了LLM驱动代理系统的效率与性能权衡，提出了高效代理框架Efficient Agents，在保持96.7%性能的同时降低了28.4%的成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）驱动的代理系统虽然能处理复杂任务，但成本高昂，限制了其可扩展性和可访问性。本研究旨在解决这一关键问题。

Method: 通过实证分析GAIA基准，评估LLM主干选择、代理框架设计和测试时扩展策略的影响，并使用成本-通过指标量化效率与性能的权衡。

Result: 提出的Efficient Agents框架在性能上接近领先的开源框架OWL（96.7%），同时将运营成本从0.398美元降至0.228美元，成本-通过指标提升了28.4%。

Conclusion: 研究为设计高效、高性能的代理系统提供了实用见解，推动了AI驱动解决方案的可访问性和可持续性。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents have
enabled sophisticated systems to tackle complex, multi-step tasks, but their
escalating costs threaten scalability and accessibility. This work presents the
first systematic study of the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in modern
agent systems, addressing the critical need for cost-effective designs without
sacrificing performance. We investigate three key questions: (1) How much
complexity do agentic tasks inherently require? (2) When do additional modules
yield diminishing returns? (3) How much efficiency can be gained through the
design of efficient agent frameworks? Through an empirical analysis on the GAIA
benchmark, we evaluate the impact of LLM backbone selection, agent framework
designs, and test-time scaling strategies. Using the cost-of-pass metric, we
quantify the efficiency-performance trade-off across these dimensions. Our
findings inform the development of Efficient Agents , a novel agent framework
that has an optimal complexity to task requirements. Efficient Agents retains
96.7% of the performance of OWL, one leading open-source agent framework, while
reducing operational costs from $0.398 to $0.228, resulting in a 28.4%
improvement in cost-of-pass. Our work provides actionable insights for
designing efficient, high-performing agent systems, advancing the accessibility
and sustainability of AI-driven solutions.

### [191] [Planning with Dynamically Changing Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02697)
*Mikhail Soutchanski,Yongmei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需领域闭包假设（DCA）的规划方法，支持动态对象变化，并证明了其完备性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统规划假设对象集固定，但实际应用中对象可能动态变化，需突破DCA限制。

Method: 基于一阶逻辑，限定初始理论为有限的流文字集，确保动作有限性，并限制计划长度。

Result: 方法在有限计划长度下完备可靠，适用于无DCA的广义规划和一致性规划交集问题。

Conclusion: 提出了一种解决动态对象规划问题的可行方法，并通过概念实现验证。

Abstract: In classical planning and conformant planning, it is assumed that there are
finitely many named objects given in advance, and only they can participate in
actions and in fluents. This is the Domain Closure Assumption (DCA). However,
there are practical planning problems where the set of objects changes
dynamically as actions are performed; e.g., new objects can be created, old
objects can be destroyed. We formulate the planning problem in first-order
logic, assume an initial theory is a finite consistent set of fluent literals,
discuss when this guarantees that in every situation there are only finitely
many possible actions, impose a finite integer bound on the length of the plan,
and propose to organize search over sequences of actions that are grounded at
planning time. We show the soundness and completeness of our approach. It can
be used to solve the bounded planning problems without DCA that belong to the
intersection of sequential generalized planning (without sensing actions) and
conformant planning, restricted to the case without the disjunction over fluent
literals. We discuss a proof-of-the-concept implementation of our planner.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为VSNIT的新方法，用于恢复不完整的人类活动序列，提升LBS数据的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LBS数据稀疏性导致活动序列不完整，难以准确推断人类移动行为。

Method: 结合Insertion Transformer和Variable Selection Network，提出VSNIT模型，动态处理协变量并恢复缺失序列。

Result: VSNIT能生成更真实、多样的活动模式，恢复效果显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: VSNIT在活动序列恢复任务中表现出色，为未来基于位置的研究提供了新框架。

Abstract: Location-Based Service (LBS) data provides critical insights into human
mobility, yet its sparsity often yields incomplete trip and activity sequences,
making accurate inferences about trips and activities difficult. We raise a
research problem: Can we use activity sequences derived from high-quality LBS
data to recover incomplete activity sequences at the individual level? This
study proposes a new solution, the Variable Selection Network-fused Insertion
Transformer (VSNIT), integrating the Insertion Transformer's flexible sequence
construction with the Variable Selection Network's dynamic covariate handling
capability, to recover missing segments in incomplete activity sequences while
preserving existing data. The findings show that VSNIT inserts more diverse,
realistic activity patterns, more closely matching real-world variability, and
restores disrupted activity transitions more effectively aligning with the
target. It also performs significantly better than the baseline model across
all metrics. These results highlight VSNIT's superior accuracy and diversity in
activity sequence recovery tasks, demonstrating its potential to enhance LBS
data utility for mobility analysis. This approach offers a promising framework
for future location-based research and applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CLIO的新方法，通过动态优化实现AI的深度推理控制，显著提升了GPT-4.1在生物学和医学问题上的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI框架在科学发现中缺乏透明性和可控性，科学家需要既能准确推理又能灵活调整的AI工具。

Method: 引入CLIO方法，通过动态优化让大型语言模型自主调整问题解决策略，并允许科学家干预和观察推理过程。

Result: CLIO使GPT-4.1在HLE测试中的准确率提升13.82%，揭示了内部不确定性波动对结果的关键影响。

Conclusion: CLIO的开放设计和动态优化为科学决策提供了更高的透明性和控制力，展现了AI在科学发现中的潜力。

Abstract: The capacity for artificial intelligence (AI) to formulate, evolve, and test
altered thought patterns under dynamic conditions indicates advanced cognition
that is crucial for scientific discovery. The existing AI development landscape
falls into two categories: 1) frameworks over non-reasoning models that
natively incorporate opinions on how humans think, and 2) reasoning models that
abstract precise control of the reasoning intuition away from end users. While
powerful, for scientists to maximize utility of AI in scientific discovery,
they not only require accuracy and transparency in reasoning, but also
steerability. Hence, we introduce an alternative approach that enables deep and
precise control over the reasoning process called: a cognitive loop via in-situ
optimization (CLIO). CLIO enables large language models (LLMs) to
self-formulate ways of approaching a problem, adapt behavior when
self-confidence is low, and ultimately provide scientists with a final belief
or answer. Through CLIO's open design, scientists can observe uncertainty
levels, understand how final belief states are formulated using graph
structures, and interject corrections. Without any further post-training,
OpenAI's GPT-4.1 with CLIO yields an accuracy of 22.37\% in text-based biology
and medicine questions on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE). This yields a 13.82\% net
or 161.64\% relative increase when compared to the base GPT-4.1 model and
surpasses OpenAI's o3 performance in high and low reasoning effort modes. We
further discovered that oscillations within internal uncertainty measures are
key in determining the accuracy of CLIO's results, revealing how its open
design and internal mechanisms can provide insight and control into scientific
decision-making processes.

*Ziruo Yi,Jinyu Liu,Ting Xiao,Mark V. Albert*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种多代理系统（MAS）用于提升放射学视觉问答（RVQA）的准确性和可靠性，解决了现有方法在事实准确性、幻觉和跨模态对齐方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）和检索增强生成（RAG）的RVQA方法在事实准确性、幻觉和跨模态对齐方面仍存在问题，需要更可靠的解决方案。

Method: 设计了一个多代理系统（MAS），包含专门用于上下文理解、多模态推理和答案验证的代理，以支持复杂的RVQA推理。

Result: 在通过模型分歧筛选的挑战性RVQA数据集上，系统表现优于多个MLLM基线，展示了其优越性和有效性。

Conclusion: 多代理系统为需要复杂推理的可解释和可信赖临床AI应用提供了潜力。

Abstract: Radiology visual question answering (RVQA) provides precise answers to
questions about chest X-ray images, alleviating radiologists' workload. While
recent methods based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have shown promising progress in RVQA,
they still face challenges in factual accuracy, hallucinations, and cross-modal
misalignment. We introduce a multi-agent system (MAS) designed to support
complex reasoning in RVQA, with specialized agents for context understanding,
multimodal reasoning, and answer validation. We evaluate our system on a
challenging RVQA set curated via model disagreement filtering, comprising
consistently hard cases across multiple MLLMs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our system over strong MLLM
baselines, with a case study illustrating its reliability and interpretability.
This work highlights the potential of multi-agent approaches to support
explainable and trustworthy clinical AI applications that require complex
reasoning.

### [196] [Seemingly Simple Planning Problems are Computationally Challenging: The Countdown Game](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02900)
*Michael Katz,Harsha Kokel,Sarath Sreedharan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于游戏Countdown的规划能力评估基准，解决了现有基准在衡量长期规划能力上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有规划基准无法有效衡量基础模型和智能体的长期规划能力，需要更合适的评估方法。

Method: 提出基于Countdown游戏的基准生成方法，支持自然语言描述、计算复杂度高且实例空间丰富。

Result: 理论分析证明其计算复杂度，实验显示现有LLM辅助规划方法在该基准上表现不佳。

Conclusion: Countdown基准能更有效评估规划能力，对现有方法构成挑战。

Abstract: There is a broad consensus that the inability to form long-term plans is one
of the key limitations of current foundational models and agents. However, the
existing planning benchmarks remain woefully inadequate to truly measure their
planning capabilities. Most existing benchmarks either focus on loosely defined
tasks like travel planning or end up leveraging existing domains and problems
from international planning competitions. While the former tasks are hard to
formalize and verify, the latter were specifically designed to test and
challenge the weaknesses of existing automated planners. To address these
shortcomings, we propose a procedure for creating a planning benchmark centered
around the game called Countdown, where a player is expected to form a target
number from a list of input numbers through arithmetic operations. We discuss
how this problem meets many of the desiderata associated with an ideal
benchmark for planning capabilities evaluation. Specifically, the domain allows
for an intuitive, natural language description for each problem instance, it is
computationally challenging (NP-complete), and the instance space is rich
enough that we do not have to worry about memorization. We perform an extensive
theoretical analysis, establishing the computational complexity result and
demonstrate the advantage of our instance generation procedure over public
benchmarks. We evaluate a variety of existing LLM-assisted planning methods on
instances generated using our procedure. Our results show that, unlike other
domains like 24 Game (a special case of Countdown), our proposed dynamic
benchmark remains extremely challenging for existing LLM-based approaches.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过从推理LLM中提取推理向量并应用于日语LLM，提升其性能，解决了日语LLM资源不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日语LLM由于资源不足，难以通过后训练方法提升性能，因此需要一种简单有效的方法。

Method: 从推理LLM中提取推理向量，并将其应用于日语LLM。

Result: 显著提升了日语LLM的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，可为其他语言提供借鉴。

Abstract: Post-training methods have improved the performance and enhanced the
reasoning capability for mainstream large language models (LLMs), but the same
is challenging for Japanese LLMs to achieve due to the amount of resources
required. Inspired by task vectors that extract the change of weights before
and after training, specifically for a certain task, we obtain reasoning
vectors from reasoning LLMs and apply them to Japanese LLMs to boost their
performance. While the resources available present a challenge to improve
Japanese LLMs, we present a simple and effective way to obtain high improvement
and hope to inspire for other languages.

TL;DR: PentestJudge是一个基于大型语言模型（LLM）的系统，用于评估渗透测试代理的操作，通过分层任务分解和简单标准实现高效评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发PentestJudge是为了解决传统方法难以程序化评估渗透测试代理操作的问题，提供一种可扩展且高效的评估方法。

Method: 采用LLM作为评估者，结合工具调用历史和代理状态轨迹，通过树状结构将任务分解为简单子任务和标准。

Result: 最佳模型的F1分数达到0.83，工具使用能力强的模型表现更接近人类专家。

Conclusion: PentestJudge展示了LLM在评估渗透测试任务中的潜力，验证可能比生成更容易，为未来研究提供了方法论支持。

Abstract: We introduce PentestJudge, a system for evaluating the operations of
penetration testing agents. PentestJudge is a large language model
(LLM)-as-judge with access to tools that allow it to consume arbitrary
trajectories of agent states and tool call history to determine whether a
security agent's actions meet certain operating criteria that would be
impractical to evaluate programmatically. We develop rubrics that use a tree
structure to hierarchically collapse the penetration testing task for a
particular environment into smaller, simpler, and more manageable sub-tasks and
criteria until each leaf node represents simple yes-or-no criteria for
PentestJudge to evaluate. Task nodes are broken down into different categories
related to operational objectives, operational security, and tradecraft.
LLM-as-judge scores are compared to human domain experts as a ground-truth
reference, allowing us to compare their relative performance with standard
binary classification metrics, such as F1 scores. We evaluate several frontier
and open-source models acting as judge agents, with the best model reaching an
F1 score of 0.83. We find models that are better at tool-use perform more
closely to human experts. By stratifying the F1 scores by requirement type, we
find even models with similar overall scores struggle with different types of
questions, suggesting certain models may be better judges of particular
operating criteria. We find that weaker and cheaper models can judge the
trajectories of pentests performed by stronger and more expensive models,
suggesting verification may be easier than generation for the penetration
testing task. We share this methodology to facilitate future research in
understanding the ability of judges to holistically and scalably evaluate the
process quality of AI-based information security agents so that they may be
confidently used in sensitive production environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AQUAH是一个基于语言的端到端水文建模代理，通过自然语言提示自动完成数据检索、模型配置、模拟运行和报告生成，实验结果被专家评价为清晰透明。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在简化复杂的环境建模流程，降低地球观测数据与决策者之间的障碍。

Method: 利用视觉支持的大型语言模型，动态解析地图和栅格数据，指导关键决策如出口选择和参数初始化。

Result: 在多个美国流域的实验中，AQUAH能够完成冷启动模拟并生成无需人工干预的分析报告。

Conclusion: 尽管仍需进一步校准和验证，但结果表明基于LLM和视觉的代理在环境建模中具有潜力。

Abstract: We introduce AQUAH, the first end-to-end language-based agent designed
specifically for hydrologic modeling. Starting from a simple natural-language
prompt (e.g., 'simulate floods for the Little Bighorn basin from 2020 to
2022'), AQUAH autonomously retrieves the required terrain, forcing, and gauge
data; configures a hydrologic model; runs the simulation; and generates a
self-contained PDF report. The workflow is driven by vision-enabled large
language models, which interpret maps and rasters on the fly and steer key
decisions such as outlet selection, parameter initialization, and uncertainty
commentary. Initial experiments across a range of U.S. basins show that AQUAH
can complete cold-start simulations and produce analyst-ready documentation
without manual intervention. The results are judged by hydrologists as clear,
transparent, and physically plausible. While further calibration and validation
are still needed for operational deployment, these early outcomes highlight the
promise of LLM-centered, vision-grounded agents to streamline complex
environmental modeling and lower the barrier between Earth observation data,
physics-based tools, and decision makers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床医生对AI工具的采用非常谨慎，模型在简单感知任务上的错误会影响其临床应用的可靠性。

Method: 引入Medblink基准测试，涵盖8个临床相关任务，共1,429道选择题和1,605张图像，评估了19种先进的多模态语言模型。

Result: 人类标注者准确率为96.4%，而最佳模型仅达到65%，表明当前模型在感知任务上表现不足。

Conclusion: 当前多模态语言模型在视觉基础方面存在不足，需进一步改进以支持临床决策。

Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) show promise for clinical decision support
and diagnostic reasoning, raising the prospect of end-to-end automated medical
image interpretation. However, clinicians are highly selective in adopting AI
tools; a model that makes errors on seemingly simple perception tasks such as
determining image orientation or identifying whether a CT scan is
contrast-enhance are unlikely to be adopted for clinical tasks. We introduce
Medblink, a benchmark designed to probe these models for such perceptual
abilities. Medblink spans eight clinically meaningful tasks across multiple
imaging modalities and anatomical regions, totaling 1,429 multiple-choice
questions over 1,605 images. We evaluate 19 state-of-the-art MLMs, including
general purpose (GPT4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) and domain specific (Med Flamingo,
LLaVA Med, RadFM) models. While human annotators achieve 96.4% accuracy, the
best-performing model reaches only 65%. These results show that current MLMs
frequently fail at routine perceptual checks, suggesting the need to strengthen
their visual grounding to support clinical adoption. Data is available on our
project page.

TL;DR: Polymath是一种自优化代理，通过动态分层工作流解决动态问题，无需标记数据，性能提升8.1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖标记数据训练工作流，难以解决动态问题，因此提出无需标记数据的自优化代理。

Method: 结合任务流图的灵活性和代码表示的工作流，采用多网格图优化和自反射进化算法优化工作流。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上平均性能提升8.1%。

Conclusion: Polymath在动态问题中表现优异，无需标记数据即可优化工作流。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at solving complex tasks by executing
agentic workflows composed of detailed instructions and structured operations.
Yet, building general-purpose agents by manually embedding foundation models
into agentic systems such as Chain-of-Thought, Self-Reflection, and ReACT
through text interfaces limits scalability and efficiency. Recently, many
researchers have sought to automate the generation and optimization of these
workflows through code-based representations. However, existing methods often
rely on labeled datasets to train and optimize workflows, making them
ineffective and inflexible for solving real-world, dynamic problems where
labeled data is unavailable. To address this challenge, we introduce Polymath,
a self-optimizing agent with dynamic hierarchical workflow that leverages the
flexibility of task flow graphs and the expressiveness of code-represented
workflows to solve a wide range of real-world, dynamic problems. The proposed
optimization methodology integrates multi-grid-inspired graph optimization with
a self-reflection-guided evolutionary algorithm to refine workflows without
labeled data. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets across coding,
math, and multi-turn QA tasks show that Polymath achieves 8.1% average
improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

Result: 在七种先进LLMs上测试，防御成功率显著提升，部分模型在增强模式下实现完美防御。

Conclusion: 该方法为提升LLM伦理提供了一种轻量、高效的解决方案，适用于多平台GenAI用例。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel self-consciousness defense mechanism for Large
Language Models (LLMs) to combat prompt injection attacks. Unlike traditional
approaches that rely on external classifiers, our method leverages the LLM's
inherent reasoning capabilities to perform self-protection. We propose a
framework that incorporates Meta-Cognitive and Arbitration Modules, enabling
LLMs to evaluate and regulate their own outputs autonomously. Our approach is
evaluated on seven state-of-the-art LLMs using two datasets: AdvBench and
Prompt-Injection-Mixed-Techniques-2024. Experiment results demonstrate
significant improvements in defense success rates across models and datasets,
with some achieving perfect and near-perfect defense in Enhanced Mode. We also
analyze the trade-off between defense success rate improvement and
computational overhead. This self-consciousness method offers a lightweight,
cost-effective solution for enhancing LLM ethics, particularly beneficial for
GenAI use cases across various platforms.

Result: 代码减少60-80%，性能提升达3.1倍，完全兼容现有功能调用标准。

Conclusion: 为工具集成架构提供理论见解和实际解决方案，助力大语言模型应用开发。

Abstract: The proliferation of tool-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) has created
a fragmented ecosystem where developers must navigate multiple protocols,
manual schema definitions, and complex execution workflows. We address this
challenge by proposing a unified approach to tool integration that abstracts
protocol differences while optimizing execution performance. Our solution
demonstrates how protocol-agnostic design principles can significantly reduce
development overhead through automated schema generation, dual-mode concurrent
execution, and seamless multi-source tool management. Experimental results show
60-80% code reduction across integration scenarios, performance improvements up
to 3.1x through optimized concurrency, and full compatibility with existing
function calling standards. This work contributes both theoretical insights
into tool integration architecture and practical solutions for real-world LLM
application development.

Conclusion: 代理评估可以补充（而非替代）人类监督，为下一代LLM的可信、可扩展评估迈出一步。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in capability and autonomy, evaluating
their outputs-especially in open-ended and complex tasks-has become a critical
bottleneck. A new paradigm is emerging: using AI agents as the evaluators
themselves. This "agent-as-a-judge" approach leverages the reasoning and
perspective-taking abilities of LLMs to assess the quality and safety of other
models, promising calable and nuanced alternatives to human evaluation. In this
review, we define the agent-as-a-judge concept, trace its evolution from
single-model judges to dynamic multi-agent debate frameworks, and critically
examine their strengths and shortcomings. We compare these approaches across
reliability, cost, and human alignment, and survey real-world deployments in
domains such as medicine, law, finance, and education. Finally, we highlight
pressing challenges-including bias, robustness, and meta evaluation-and outline
future research directions. By bringing together these strands, our review
demonstrates how agent-based judging can complement (but not replace) human
oversight, marking a step toward trustworthy, scalable evaluation for
next-generation LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言推理模型在交互环境中多轮代理规划时的信用分配和计算效率问题。

Method: 提出BPO框架，包括引导（使用规划四元组和长短链思维融合）、外推（复杂度分层课程学习）和优化（奖励门控拒绝采样）。

Result: 在ALFWorld、ScienceWorld和WebShop上实现最优性能，且显著提升令牌效率。

Conclusion: BPO为代理规划中的推理模型提供了新的解决方案，适用于长时稀疏奖励环境。

Abstract: Large Language Reasoning Models have demonstrated remarkable success on
static tasks, yet their application to multi-round agentic planning in
interactive environments faces two fundamental challenges. First, the
intractable credit assignment problem renders conventional reinforcement
learning ineffective in sparse-reward settings. Second, the computational
overhead of verbose, step-by-step reasoning histories is prohibitive. To
address these challenges, we propose BPO, a three-stage framework
(bootstrapping, extrapolation, and refinement) that establishes a
self-improving data flywheel to develop robust reasoning models for
long-horizon, sparse-reward environments. Our framework first bootstraps
efficient reasoning using the proposed planning quaternions with long-short
chain-of-thought fusion. It then extrapolates to out-of-distribution tasks
through complexity-stratified curriculum learning. Finally, the model
iteratively refines itself by learning exclusively on experiences selected via
reward-gated rejection sampling. Experiments on ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and
WebShop demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art with
significant token efficiency, providing a new recipe for reasoning models in
agentic planning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多智能体的MILP求解框架Collab-Solver，通过Stackelberg博弈协同优化多个模块的策略，显著提升求解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的MILP方法独立处理各模块策略，忽视其相互依赖，影响求解速度和质量。

Method: 将MILP求解中的割平面选择和分支协作建模为Stackelberg博弈，采用两阶段学习范式（数据通信预训练和模块策略协调）稳定协同策略学习。

Result: 在合成和大规模真实MILP数据集上显著提升求解性能，且策略具有优秀的跨实例集泛化能力。

Conclusion: Collab-Solver通过协同策略学习有效解决了MILP求解中的模块独立性问题，提升了整体性能。

Abstract: Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) has been a fundamental problem in
combinatorial optimization. Previous works have designed a plethora of
hard-coded heuristics to accomplish challenging MILP solving with domain
knowledge. Driven by the high capability of neural networks, recent research is
devoted to replacing manually designed heuristics with learned policies.
Although learning-based MILP methods have shown great promise, existing
worksindependentlytreatthepolicylearningineachmoduleofMILPsolvers without
considering their interdependence, severely hurting the solving speed and
quality. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-agent-based policy
learning framework for MILP (Collab-Solver), which can collaboratively optimize
the policies for multiple modules. Specifically, we formulate the collaboration
of cut selection and branching in MILP solving as a Stackelberg game. Under
this formulation, we develop a two-phase learning paradigm to stabilize the
collaborative policy learning, where the first phase achieves the
data-communicated policy pretraining and the second phase further orchestrates
the policy learning for various modules. The jointly learned policy
significantly improves the solving performance on both synthetic and
large-scale real-world MILP datasets. Moreover, the policies learned by
Collab-Solver have also demonstrated excellent generalization abilities across
different instance sets.

Result: GPT-2能学习元ODE算法，性能优于欧拉方法，且随着演示数量增加精度呈指数提升，并能泛化到OOD问题。

Conclusion: 研究为ICL机制提供了新见解，展示了其在解决非线性数值问题中的潜力。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as a new paradigm in large language
models (LLMs), enabling them to perform novel tasks by conditioning on a few
examples embedded in the prompt. Yet, the highly nonlinear behavior of ICL for
NLP tasks remains poorly understood. To shed light on its underlying
mechanisms, this paper investigates whether LLMs can solve ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) under the ICL setting. We formulate standard ODE
problems and their solutions as sequential prompts and evaluate GPT-2 models on
these tasks. Experiments on two types of ODEs show that GPT-2 can effectively
learn a meta-ODE algorithm, with convergence behavior comparable to, or better
than, the Euler method, and achieve exponential accuracy gains with increasing
numbers of demonstrations. Moreover, the model generalizes to
out-of-distribution (OOD) problems, demonstrating robust extrapolation
capabilities. These empirical findings provide new insights into the mechanisms
of ICL in NLP and its potential for solving nonlinear numerical problems.

Method: 引入树状结构记录推理路径和临床证据，并提出交叉验证机制确保多智能体决策一致性。

Result: 在真实医疗数据上的实验表明，该框架优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: ToR框架显著提升了多智能体在复杂医疗场景中的临床推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in the medical
domain. However, existing models still fall short when faced with complex
medical diagnosis task in the real world. This is mainly because they lack
sufficient reasoning depth, which leads to information loss or logical jumps
when processing a large amount of specialized medical data, leading to
diagnostic errors. To address these challenges, we propose Tree-of-Reasoning
(ToR), a novel multi-agent framework designed to handle complex scenarios.
Specifically, ToR introduces a tree structure that can clearly record the
reasoning path of LLMs and the corresponding clinical evidence. At the same
time, we propose a cross-validation mechanism to ensure the consistency of
multi-agent decision-making, thereby improving the clinical reasoning ability
of multi-agents in complex medical scenarios. Experimental results on
real-world medical data show that our framework can achieve better performance
than existing baseline methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法依赖浅层模式匹配，难以应对新型攻击策略。

Method: CDD框架结合全局感知和局部分析，通过监督微调和熵引导强化学习（EG-GRPO）识别和探索攻击模式。

Result: 实验显示CDD在防御性能和泛化能力上达到最优水平。

Conclusion: CDD为LLMs的安全部署提供了高效且通用的防御方案。

Abstract: Defending large language models (LLMs) against jailbreak attacks is essential
for their safe and reliable deployment. Existing defenses often rely on shallow
pattern matching, which struggles to generalize to novel and unseen attack
strategies. To address this challenge, we propose the Cognitive-Driven Defense
(CDD) framework, which targets the underlying structure of jailbreak prompts by
applying meta-operations, defined as basic manipulations that conceal harmful
intent.CDD emulates human cognitive reasoning through a structured reasoning
chain. It begins with a global perception of the prompt and follows with a
localized analysis to uncover hidden manipulations. By applying supervised
fine-tuning on this structured chain, the model learns to identify and reason
about known manipulation patterns. To enhance generalization to unseen threats,
an entropy-guided reinforcement learning algorithm (EG-GRPO) is introduced to
encourage exploration of new types and variants of meta-operations. Experiments
demonstrate that CDD can achieve state-of-the-art defense performance and
exhibit strong generalization to unseen jailbreak attacks.

TL;DR: 论文评估开源与专有大型语言模型在法律风险分析中的表现，发现专有模型整体更优，开源模型需针对性优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索开源大型语言模型在法律领域的潜力，解决数据保密性问题。

Method: 使用ContractEval基准和CUAD数据集，评估4个专有和15个开源模型。

Result: 专有模型表现更优，开源模型需优化；推理模式影响输出效果；量化加速但降低性能。

Conclusion: 开源模型需针对性优化以适用于高风险法律场景，ContractEval为未来研究提供基准。

Abstract: The potential of large language models (LLMs) in specialized domains such as
legal risk analysis remains underexplored. In response to growing interest in
locally deploying open-source LLMs for legal tasks while preserving data
confidentiality, this paper introduces ContractEval, the first benchmark to
thoroughly evaluate whether open-source LLMs could match proprietary LLMs in
identifying clause-level legal risks in commercial contracts. Using the
Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD), we assess 4 proprietary and 15
open-source LLMs. Our results highlight five key findings: (1) Proprietary
models outperform open-source models in both correctness and output
effectiveness, though some open-source models are competitive in certain
specific dimensions. (2) Larger open-source models generally perform better,
though the improvement slows down as models get bigger. (3) Reasoning
("thinking") mode improves output effectiveness but reduces correctness, likely
due to over-complicating simpler tasks. (4) Open-source models generate "no
related clause" responses more frequently even when relevant clauses are
present. This suggests "laziness" in thinking or low confidence in extracting
relevant content. (5) Model quantization speeds up inference but at the cost of
performance drop, showing the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. These
findings suggest that while most LLMs perform at a level comparable to junior
legal assistants, open-source models require targeted fine-tuning to ensure
correctness and effectiveness in high-stakes legal settings. ContractEval
offers a solid benchmark to guide future development of legal-domain LLMs.

Motivation: 现有方法仅设计单一启发式，导致对不同分布或设置的泛化能力较差。

Method: 提出AHSD框架，利用互补种群管理和互补感知的模因搜索机制（EoH-S）生成高质量且互补的启发式集合。

Result: 在三个AHD任务上的实验表明，EoH-S显著优于现有方法，性能提升高达60%。

Conclusion: AHSD和EoH-S为LLM驱动的启发式设计提供了更优的解决方案，显著提升了泛化能力。

Abstract: Automated Heuristic Design (AHD) using Large Language Models (LLMs) has
achieved notable success in recent years. Despite the effectiveness of existing
approaches, they only design a single heuristic to serve all problem instances,
often inducing poor generalization across different distributions or settings.
To address this issue, we propose Automated Heuristic Set Design (AHSD), a new
formulation for LLM-driven AHD. The aim of AHSD is to automatically generate a
small-sized complementary heuristic set to serve diverse problem instances,
such that each problem instance could be optimized by at least one heuristic in
this set. We show that the objective function of AHSD is monotone and
supermodular. Then, we propose Evolution of Heuristic Set (EoH-S) to apply the
AHSD formulation for LLM-driven AHD. With two novel mechanisms of complementary
population management and complementary-aware memetic search, EoH-S could
effectively generate a set of high-quality and complementary heuristics.
Comprehensive experimental results on three AHD tasks with diverse instances
spanning various sizes and distributions demonstrate that EoH-S consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art AHD methods and achieves up to 60\%
performance improvements.

Motivation: 现有基于DDPM的缺失数据填补方法存在高推理延迟和输出不稳定的问题，限制了其在实际表格数据中的应用。

Method: 提出MissDDIM，一种基于DDIM的条件扩散框架，用于表格数据填补。

Result: MissDDIM通过确定性采样减少了输出不稳定性，同时保持了填补的多样性。

Conclusion: MissDDIM在表格数据填补中表现出更高的效率和稳定性，适合实际应用。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful tools for missing data
imputation by modeling the joint distribution of observed and unobserved
variables. However, existing methods, typically based on stochastic denoising
diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), suffer from high inference latency and
variable outputs, limiting their applicability in real-world tabular settings.
To address these deficiencies, we present in this paper MissDDIM, a conditional
diffusion framework that adapts Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for
tabular imputation. While stochastic sampling enables diverse completions, it
also introduces output variability that complicates downstream processing.

TL;DR: T2UE框架通过仅使用文本描述生成不可学习的示例（UEs），避免了原始图像数据的暴露，解决了隐私保护中的矛盾问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模预训练框架依赖网络抓取的数据集，可能包含私人数据，引发隐私滥用问题。现有UE生成方法需要暴露数据给第三方服务，导致隐私矛盾。

Method: 提出T2UE框架，利用文本到图像（T2I）模型将文本描述映射到图像（噪声）空间，结合误差最小化框架生成有效的不可学习噪声。

Result: 实验表明，T2UE保护的数据显著降低了最先进模型在下游任务（如跨模态检索）中的性能，且保护效果泛化到多种架构和监督学习场景。

Conclusion: T2UE实现了“零接触数据保护”，仅基于文本描述即可保护个人数据，无需直接暴露数据。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-training frameworks like CLIP have revolutionized multimodal
learning, but their reliance on web-scraped datasets, frequently containing
private user data, raises serious concerns about misuse. Unlearnable Examples
(UEs) have emerged as a promising countermeasure against unauthorized model
training, employing carefully crafted unlearnable noise to disrupt the learning
of meaningful representations from protected data. Current approaches typically
generate UEs by jointly optimizing unlearnable noise for both images and their
associated text descriptions (or labels). However, this optimization process is
often computationally prohibitive for on-device execution, forcing reliance on
external third-party services. This creates a fundamental privacy paradox:
users must initially expose their data to these very services to achieve
protection, thereby compromising privacy in the process. Such a contradiction
has severely hindered the development of practical, scalable data protection
solutions. To resolve this paradox, we introduce \textbf{Text-to-Unlearnable
Example (T2UE)}, a novel framework that enables users to generate UEs using
only text descriptions. T2UE circumvents the need for original image data by
employing a text-to-image (T2I) model to map text descriptions into the image
(noise) space, combined with an error-minimization framework to produce
effective unlearnable noise. Extensive experiments show that T2UE-protected
data substantially degrades performance in downstream tasks (e.g., cross-modal
retrieval) for state-of-the-art models. Notably, the protective effect
generalizes across diverse architectures and even to supervised learning
settings. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of "zero-contact data
protection", where personal data can be safeguarded based solely on their
textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct data exposure.

Abstract: With the proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs), the detection of

proposes an innovative verifiable misinformation detection LLM agent that goes
beyond traditional true/false binary judgments. The agent actively verifies
claims through dynamic interaction with diverse web sources, assesses

core tools: precise web search tool, source credibility assessment tool and
numerical claim verification tool. These tools enable the agent to execute
multi-step verification strategies, maintain evidence logs, and form
comprehensive assessment conclusions. We evaluate using standard misinformation
datasets such as FakeNewsNet, comparing with traditional machine learning
models and LLMs. Evaluation metrics include standard classification metrics,
quality assessment of reasoning processes, and robustness testing against
rewritten content. Experimental results show that our agent outperforms
baseline methods in misinformation detection accuracy, reasoning transparency,
and resistance to information rewriting, providing a new paradigm for
trustworthy AI-assisted fact-checking.

Result: Echo模式准确率最高，DeepSeek多样性最佳。

Conclusion: 研究为提升代理学习能力和智能教育模型提供了有价值的信息。

Abstract: Generative agent models specifically tailored for smart education are
critical, yet remain relatively underdeveloped. A key challenge stems from the
inherent complexity of educational contexts: learners are human beings with
various cognitive behaviors, and pedagogy is fundamentally centered on
personalized human-to-human communication. To address this issue, this paper
proposes AgentSME, a unified generative agent framework powered by LLM. Three
directional communication modes are considered in the models, namely Solo,
Mono, and Echo, reflecting different types of agency autonomy and communicative
reciprocity. Accuracy is adopted as the primary evaluation metric, complemented
by three diversity indices designed to assess the diversity of reasoning
contents. Six widely used LLMs are tested to validate the robustness of
communication modes across different model tiers, which are equally divided
into base-capacity and high-capacity configurations. The results show that
generative agents that employ the Echo communication mode achieve the highest
accuracy scores, while DeepSeek exhibits the greatest diversity. This study
provides valuable information to improve agent learning capabilities and
inspire smart education models.

Abstract: We present a framework for training trustworthy large language model (LLM)
agents for optimization modeling via a verifiable synthetic data generation
pipeline. Focusing on linear and mixed-integer linear programming, our approach
begins with structured symbolic representations and systematically produces
natural language descriptions, mathematical formulations, and solver-executable
code. By programmatically constructing each instance with known optimal
solutions, the pipeline ensures full verifiability and enables automatic
filtering of low-quality demonstrations generated by teacher models. Each
dataset instance includes a structured representation of the optimization
problem, a corresponding natural language description, the verified optimal
solution, and step-by-step demonstrations - generated by a teacher model - that
show how to model and solve the problem across multiple optimization modeling
languages. This enables supervised fine-tuning of open-source LLMs specifically
tailored to optimization tasks. To operationalize this pipeline, we introduce
OptiTrust, a modular LLM agent that performs multi-stage translation from
natural language to solver-ready code, leveraging stepwise demonstrations,
multi-language inference, and majority-vote cross-validation. Our agent
achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks. Out of 7
datasets, it achieves the highest accuracy on six and outperforms the next-best
algorithm by at least 8 percentage on three of them. Our approach provides a
scalable, verifiable, and principled path toward building reliable LLM agents
for real-world optimization applications.

have improved reasoning tasks, existing models typically struggle with formal
geometric reasoning, particularly when dynamically constructing and verifying
auxiliary geometric elements. To address these challenges, we introduce
Geoint-R1, a multimodal reasoning framework designed to generate formally
verifiable geometric solutions from textual descriptions and visual diagrams.
Geoint-R1 uniquely integrates auxiliary elements construction, formal reasoning
represented via Lean4, and interactive visualization. To systematically
evaluate and advance formal geometric reasoning, we propose the Geoint
benchmark, comprising 1,885 rigorously annotated geometry problems across
diverse topics such as plane, spatial, and solid geometry. Each problem
includes structured textual annotations, precise Lean4 code for auxiliary
constructions, and detailed solution steps verified by experts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Geoint-R1 significantly surpasses existing
multimodal and math-specific reasoning models, particularly on challenging
problems requiring explicit auxiliary element constructions.

Abstract: Collaborative partnership matters in inquiry-oriented education. However,
most study partners are selected either rely on experience-based assignments
with little scientific planning or build on rule-based machine assistants,
encountering difficulties in knowledge expansion and inadequate flexibility.
This paper proposes an LLM-empowered agent model for simulating and selecting
learning partners tailored to inquiry-oriented learning, named InqEduAgent.
Generative agents are designed to capture cognitive and evaluative features of
learners in real-world scenarios. Then, an adaptive matching algorithm with
Gaussian process augmentation is formulated to identify patterns within prior
knowledge. Optimal learning-partner matches are provided for learners facing
different exercises. The experimental results show the optimal performance of
InqEduAgent in most knowledge-learning scenarios and LLM environment with
different levels of capabilities. This study promotes the intelligent
allocation of human-based learning partners and the formulation of AI-based
learning partners. The code, data, and appendix are publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种全历史图模型和ETDNet网络，用于建模实体间动态交互，显著提升了驾驶意图预测和比特币欺诈检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实任务中需要建模实体间动态交互（如交通预测、金融欺诈检测），现有方法通常使用快照图，无法充分捕捉关系和时间的演化。

Method: 提出全历史图模型，区分时间步内和时间步间边，并设计ETDNet网络，结合图注意力和时间注意力模块。

Result: 在Waymo和Elliptic++数据集上，ETDNet分别将联合准确率提升至75.6%（原74.1%）和非法类F1提升至88.1%（原60.4%）。

Conclusion: 通过将结构和时间关系表示为图中的不同边，显著提升了动态交互建模的性能。

Abstract: Modeling evolving interactions among entities is critical in many real-world
tasks. For example, predicting driver maneuvers in traffic requires tracking
how neighboring vehicles accelerate, brake, and change lanes relative to one
another over consecutive frames. Likewise, detecting financial fraud hinges on
following the flow of funds through successive transactions as they propagate
through the network. Unlike classic time-series forecasting, these settings
demand reasoning over who interacts with whom and when, calling for a
temporal-graph representation that makes both the relations and their evolution
explicit. Existing temporal-graph methods typically use snapshot graphs to
encode temporal evolution. We introduce a full-history graph that instantiates
one node for every entity at every time step and separates two edge sets: (i)
intra-time-step edges that capture relations within a single frame and (ii)
inter-time-step edges that connect an entity to itself at consecutive steps. To
learn on this graph we design an Edge-Type Decoupled Network (ETDNet) with
parallel modules: a graph-attention module aggregates information along
intra-time-step edges, a multi-head temporal-attention module attends over an
entity's inter-time-step history, and a fusion module combines the two messages
after every layer. Evaluated on driver-intention prediction (Waymo) and Bitcoin
fraud detection (Elliptic++), ETDNet consistently surpasses strong baselines,
lifting Waymo joint accuracy to 75.6\% (vs. 74.1\%) and raising Elliptic++
illicit-class F1 to 88.1\% (vs. 60.4\%). These gains demonstrate the benefit of
representing structural and temporal relations as distinct edges in a single
graph.

TL;DR: ToolVQA是一个大规模多模态数据集，旨在提升大型基础模型在真实世界工具使用中的能力，通过模拟人类工具使用推理生成数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强的视觉问答（VQA）在真实世界工具使用能力上存在显著不足，特别是在需要多步推理的多模态场景中。

Method: 提出ToolVQA数据集和ToolEngine数据生成管道，采用深度优先搜索（DFS）和动态上下文示例匹配机制模拟人类工具使用推理。

Result: 在ToolVQA上微调的7B大型基础模型在测试集上表现优异，并在多个分布外数据集上超越GPT-3.5-turbo。

Conclusion: ToolVQA和ToolEngine显著提升了模型在真实世界工具使用场景中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Integrating external tools into Large Foundation Models (LFMs) has emerged as
a promising approach to enhance their problem-solving capabilities. While
existing studies have demonstrated strong performance in tool-augmented Visual
Question Answering (VQA), recent benchmarks reveal significant gaps in
real-world tool-use proficiency, particularly in functionally diverse
multimodal settings requiring multi-step reasoning. In this work, we introduce
ToolVQA, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising 23K instances, designed to
bridge this gap. Unlike previous datasets that rely on synthetic scenarios and
simplified queries, ToolVQA features real-world visual contexts and challenging
implicit multi-step reasoning tasks, better aligning with real user
interactions. To construct this dataset, we propose ToolEngine, a novel data
generation pipeline that employs Depth-First Search (DFS) with a dynamic
in-context example matching mechanism to simulate human-like tool-use
reasoning. ToolVQA encompasses 10 multimodal tools across 7 diverse task
domains, with an average inference length of 2.78 reasoning steps per instance.
The fine-tuned 7B LFMs on ToolVQA not only achieve impressive performance on
our test set but also surpass the large close-sourced model GPT-3.5-turbo on
various out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, demonstrating strong
generalizability to real-world tool-use scenarios.

TL;DR: Nemori是一种新型自组织记忆架构，通过两步对齐原则和预测校准原则解决LLMs在长期交互中的记忆问题，显著优于现有系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在长期交互中因缺乏持久记忆而受限，现有记忆系统因依赖任意粒度和被动规则而无法真正学习和进化。

Method: 提出Nemori架构，采用两步对齐原则（基于事件分割理论）和预测校准原则（基于自由能原理），主动学习预测差距。

Result: 在LoCoMo和LongMemEval基准测试中，Nemori显著优于现有系统，尤其在长上下文场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: Nemori为解决自主代理在长期动态工作流中的记忆问题提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities, yet their
inability to maintain persistent memory in long contexts limits their
effectiveness as autonomous agents in long-term interactions. While existing
memory systems have made progress, their reliance on arbitrary granularity for
defining the basic memory unit and passive, rule-based mechanisms for knowledge
extraction limits their capacity for genuine learning and evolution. To address
these foundational limitations, we present Nemori, a novel self-organizing
memory architecture inspired by human cognitive principles. Nemori's core
innovation is twofold: First, its Two-Step Alignment Principle, inspired by
Event Segmentation Theory, provides a principled, top-down method for
autonomously organizing the raw conversational stream into semantically
coherent episodes, solving the critical issue of memory granularity. Second,
its Predict-Calibrate Principle, inspired by the Free-energy Principle, enables
the agent to proactively learn from prediction gaps, moving beyond pre-defined
heuristics to achieve adaptive knowledge evolution. This offers a viable path
toward handling the long-term, dynamic workflows of autonomous agents.
Extensive experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks demonstrate that
Nemori significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art systems, with its
advantage being particularly pronounced in longer contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM（如ChatGPT和Claude）的兴起，需要能够实时处理任务的AI代理。传统云端部署导致高延迟，而边缘部署面临资源有限和异构性的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种自适应框架，结合蚁群算法和基于LLM的优化，建模资源约束和延迟/成本，实现高效决策和轻量级代理迁移。

Result: 在分布式系统上实现并验证，显著降低了部署延迟和迁移成本。

Conclusion: 该方案为动态边缘环境中LLM-based AI代理的高效部署和管理提供了系统性解决方案。

Abstract: The rise of LLMs such as ChatGPT and Claude fuels the need for AI agents
capable of real-time task handling. However, migrating data-intensive,
multi-modal edge workloads to cloud data centers, traditionally used for agent
deployment, introduces significant latency. Deploying AI agents at the edge
improves efficiency and reduces latency. However, edge environments present
challenges due to limited and heterogeneous resources. Maintaining QoS for
mobile users necessitates agent migration, which is complicated by the
complexity of AI agents coordinating LLMs, task planning, memory, and external
tools. This paper presents the first systematic deployment and management
solution for LLM-based AI agents in dynamic edge environments. We propose a
novel adaptive framework for AI agent placement and migration in edge
intelligence systems. Our approach models resource constraints and
latency/cost, leveraging ant colony algorithms and LLM-based optimization for
efficient decision-making. It autonomously places agents to optimize resource
utilization and QoS and enables lightweight agent migration by transferring
only essential state. Implemented on a distributed system using AgentScope and
validated across globally distributed edge servers, our solution significantly
reduces deployment latency and migration costs.

Motivation: LLMs使用CoT提示时生成的冗长推理过程存在大量冗余，增加了推理成本并降低了效率。

Method: 引入步骤熵度量冗余，提出两阶段训练策略（SFT和GRPO），结合[SKIP]标记生成压缩推理链。

Result: 实验表明80%低熵步骤可被剪枝且准确率影响极小，显著提升推理效率。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持准确性的同时大幅优化推理效率，对LLM实际部署和推理结构理解有重要意义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting excel at
complex reasoning but generate verbose thought processes with considerable
redundancy, leading to increased inference costs and reduced efficiency. We
introduce a novel CoT compression framework based on step entropy, a metric
that quantifies the informational contribution of individual reasoning steps to
identify redundancy. Through theoretical analysis and extensive empirical
validation on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we demonstrate that steps with
low entropy are indeed highly redundant. Our experiments reveal that an
astonishing 80\% of low-entropy intermediate steps can be pruned with minor
degradation in the final answer accuracy across DeepSeek-R1-7B, 14B and
Qwen3-8B. This finding sharply contrasts with random or high-entropy pruning,
which severely impairs reasoning performance. Building on this, we propose a
novel two-stage training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning. This approach
enables LLMs to autonomously learn to generate compressed COTs during inference
by strategically incorporating [SKIP] tokens. Our method significantly enhances
LLM inference efficiency while rigorously preserving accuracy, offering
profound implications for practical LLM deployment and a deeper understanding
of reasoning structures.

Motivation: 当前基于语音的认知障碍评估方法在跨语言和跨临床环境中的泛化能力不足，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 使用统一的多模态流程评估模型在英语和普通话数据集上的表现，并探索链式思维提示和LoRA轻量微调。

Result: 传统深度学习模型在跨域迁移时性能显著下降，而配备链式思维提示的LLMs表现更好，LoRA微调进一步提升了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究为构建临床实用且语言鲁棒的语音认知评估工具提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Automatic assessment of cognitive impairment from spontaneous speech offers a
promising, non-invasive avenue for early cognitive screening. However, current
approaches often lack generalizability when deployed across different languages
and clinical settings, limiting their practical utility. In this study, we
propose CogBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the cross-lingual
and cross-site generalizability of large language models (LLMs) for
speech-based cognitive impairment assessment. Using a unified multimodal
pipeline, we evaluate model performance on three speech datasets spanning
English and Mandarin: ADReSSo, NCMMSC2021-AD, and a newly collected test set,
CIR-E. Our results show that conventional deep learning models degrade
substantially when transferred across domains. In contrast, LLMs equipped with
chain-of-thought prompting demonstrate better adaptability, though their
performance remains sensitive to prompt design. Furthermore, we explore
lightweight fine-tuning of LLMs via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which
significantly improves generalization in target domains. These findings offer a
critical step toward building clinically useful and linguistically robust
speech-based cognitive assessment tools.

Result: 混合方法在解释性和保留LLM优势方面表现更优，更适合通用逻辑推理。

Conclusion: 混合方法更具潜力，并提出了基于LLM-SS的通用框架以支持未来研究。

Abstract: General logical reasoning, defined as the ability to reason deductively on
domain-agnostic tasks, continues to be a challenge for large language models
(LLMs). Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not
interpretable. As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in
neurosymbolic AI, which attempts to incorporate logic into neural networks. We
first identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical
reasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic
reasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach
comprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network,
performs symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on
domain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on
domain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there
has not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the
following question: Which approach is more promising for developing general
logical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class
domain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses
the integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the
hybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each
approach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising
for developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is
more interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of
existing LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a
generalizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design,
model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input.

<details>

Motivation: 自然语言描述在复杂需求（如系统行为、条件逻辑和架构约束）上存在歧义，难以准确生成代码。

Method: 1. 引入增强的UML序列图，结合决策表和API规范；2. 提出数据依赖推理（DDI）任务，构建显式数据依赖图。

Result: 通过形式化规范和DDI任务，显著减少了歧义和复杂性，提高了代码生成的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: UML2Dep框架通过形式化规范和依赖推理，有效解决了自然语言描述的局限性，为复杂代码生成提供了可靠方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating code from natural language
(NL) descriptions. However, the plain textual descriptions are inherently
ambiguous and often fail to capture complex requirements like intricate system
behaviors, conditional logic, and architectural constraints; implicit data
dependencies in service-oriented architectures are difficult to infer and
handle correctly. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel step-by-step code
generation framework named UML2Dep by leveraging unambiguous formal
specifications of complex requirements. First, we introduce an enhanced Unified
Modeling Language (UML) sequence diagram tailored for service-oriented
architectures. This diagram extends traditional visual syntax by integrating
decision tables and API specifications, explicitly formalizing structural
relationships and business logic flows in service interactions to rigorously
eliminate linguistic ambiguity. Second, recognizing the critical role of data
flow, we introduce a dedicated data dependency inference (DDI) task. DDI
systematically constructs an explicit data dependency graph prior to actual
code synthesis. To ensure reliability, we formalize DDI as a constrained
mathematical reasoning task through novel prompting strategies, aligning with
LLMs' excellent mathematical strengths. Additional static parsing and
dependency pruning further reduce context complexity and cognitive load
associated with intricate specifications, thereby enhancing reasoning accuracy
and efficiency.

Motivation: 大语言模型在推理和生成方面表现出色，但在识别和诊断复杂错误方面仍有不足，主要原因是训练目标偏向正确答案，缺乏对错误的学习。

Method: 提出Hide and Seek Game (HSG)框架，包含两个对抗角色：Sneaky（生成隐蔽错误）和Diagnosis（检测错误），通过对抗协同进化提升能力。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，HSG显著提升了错误诊断能力，准确率比GPT-4o等基线模型高16.8%--31.4%。

Conclusion: HSG框架有效提升了模型的错误诊断能力，并发布了一个具有挑战性的数据集作为未来研究的基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning and generation across
domains, but still struggle with identifying and diagnosing complex errors.
This stems mainly from training objectives that prioritize correct answers,
limiting exposure to and learning from errors. While recent studies have begun
to address this by introducing error signals, most rely on shallow, static
errors, restricting improvement in deep diagnostic ability. To overcome this,
we propose Hide and Seek Game (HSG), a dynamic adversarial framework for error
generation and diagnosis, and evaluate it on mathematical problem-solving. HSG
involves two adversarial roles: Sneaky, which "hides" by generating subtle,
deceptive reasoning errors, and Diagnosis, which "seeks" to accurately detect
them. Through adversarial co-evolution, both error stealth and diagnostic
precision are enhanced. Experiments on several math reasoning tasks show that
HSG significantly boosts error diagnosis, achieving 16.8\%--31.4\% higher
accuracy than baselines like GPT-4o. We also release a challenging dataset of
deceptive errors and diagnostic annotations as a benchmark for future research.

Motivation: 解决现有LLM方法在诊断不可行模型时未考虑多潜在调整的问题。

Method: 结合LLM代理和多目标优化，生成权衡解决方案并分析。

Result: MOID在单次运行中生成多种诊断建议，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MOID为恢复模型可行性和决策提供更实用的见解。

Abstract: In real-world routing problems, users often propose conflicting or
unreasonable requirements, which result in infeasible optimization models due
to overly restrictive or contradictory constraints, leading to an empty
feasible solution set. Existing Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods
attempt to diagnose infeasible models, but modifying such models often involves
multiple potential adjustments that these methods do not consider. To fill this
gap, we introduce Multi-Objective Infeasibility Diagnosis (MOID), which
combines LLM agents and multi-objective optimization within an automatic
routing solver, to provide a set of representative actionable suggestions.
Specifically, MOID employs multi-objective optimization to consider both path
cost and constraint violation, generating a set of trade-off solutions, each
encompassing varying degrees of model adjustments. To extract practical
insights from these solutions, MOID utilizes LLM agents to generate a solution
analysis function for the infeasible model. This function analyzes these
distinct solutions to diagnose the original infeasible model, providing users
with diverse diagnostic insights and suggestions. Finally, we compare MOID with
several LLM-based methods on 50 types of infeasible routing problems. The
results indicate that MOID automatically generates multiple diagnostic
suggestions in a single run, providing more practical insights for restoring
model feasibility and decision-making compared to existing methods.

Motivation: 解决医学数据快速增长导致临床和研究领域难以系统化理解和应用最新知识的挑战。

Result: 增强三元组的生成句子与原命题的平均余弦相似度为0.874，优于普通三元组。LLM还能推断新关系并连接知识图谱中的集群。

Conclusion: 该方法为医学从业者提供了集中、实时更新的知识来源，并可能推广到其他领域。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of publicly-available medical data presents a challenge
for clinicians and researchers alike, increasing the gap between the volume of
scientific literature and its applications. The steady growth of studies and
findings overwhelms medical professionals at large, hindering their ability to
systematically review and understand the latest knowledge. This paper presents
an approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG)
generation to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of
large language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts
into semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from
these sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain
and ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate
ontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during
extraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming
`quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing
natural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original
propositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity
for generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated
sentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context
variable. Furthermore, this research explores the ability for LLMs to infer new
relationships and connect clusters in the knowledge base of the knowledge
graph. This approach leads the way to provide medical practitioners with a
centralised, updated in real-time, and sustainable knowledge source, and may be
the foundation of similar gains in a wide variety of fields.

Motivation: 传统信念表示方法（如概率分布或逻辑命题）忽略了信念内部结构，无法处理矛盾或碎片化的认知状态。

Result: 该方法能够更精细地表示信念结构，支持对认知状态（如一致性、矛盾）的丰富分类。

Conclusion: 该形式化为信念系统的内部组织分析提供了基础，优于传统概率或逻辑方法。

Abstract: Belief systems are often treated as globally consistent sets of propositions
or as scalar-valued probability distributions. Such representations tend to
obscure the internal structure of belief, conflate external credibility with
internal coherence, and preclude the modeling of fragmented or contradictory
epistemic states. This paper introduces a minimal formalism for belief systems
as directed, weighted graphs. In this framework, nodes represent individual
beliefs, edges encode epistemic relationships (e.g., support or contradiction),
and two distinct functions assign each belief a credibility (reflecting source
trust) and a confidence (derived from internal structural support). Unlike
classical probabilistic models, our approach does not assume prior coherence or
require belief updating. Unlike logical and argumentation-based frameworks, it
supports fine-grained structural representation without committing to binary
justification status or deductive closure. The model is purely static and
deliberately excludes inference or revision procedures. Its aim is to provide a
foundational substrate for analyzing the internal organization of belief
systems, including coherence conditions, epistemic tensions, and
representational limits. By distinguishing belief structure from belief
strength, this formalism enables a richer classification of epistemic states
than existing probabilistic, logical, or argumentation-based approaches.

Result: 实验表明，SmartGen显著提升了行为漂移下的异常检测（85.43%）和行为预测（70.51%）性能。

Conclusion: SmartGen通过生成高质量的行为数据，有效解决了智能家居模型的行为漂移问题。

Abstract: As smart homes become increasingly prevalent, intelligent models are widely
used for tasks such as anomaly detection and behavior prediction. These models
are typically trained on static datasets, making them brittle to behavioral
drift caused by seasonal changes, lifestyle shifts, or evolving routines.
However, collecting new behavior data for retraining is often impractical due
to its slow pace, high cost, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose
SmartGen, an LLM-based framework that synthesizes context-aware user behavior
data to support continual adaptation of downstream smart home models. SmartGen
consists of four key components. First, we design a Time and Semantic-aware
Split module to divide long behavior sequences into manageable, semantically
coherent subsequences under dual time-span constraints. Second, we propose
Semantic-aware Sequence Compression to reduce input length while preserving
representative semantics by clustering behavior mapping in latent space. Third,
we introduce Graph-guided Sequence Synthesis, which constructs a behavior
relationship graph and encodes frequent transitions into prompts, guiding the
LLM to generate data aligned with contextual changes while retaining core
behavior patterns. Finally, we design a Two-stage Outlier Filter to identify
and remove implausible or semantically inconsistent outputs, aiming to improve
the factual coherence and behavioral validity of the generated sequences.
Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that SmartGen
significantly enhances model performance on anomaly detection and behavior
prediction tasks under behavioral drift, with anomaly detection improving by
85.43% and behavior prediction by 70.51% on average. The code is available at

*Yijin Yang,Cristina Cornelio,Mario Leiva,Paulo Shakarian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EDCIM是一种检测和纠正大语言模型在数学任务中错误的方法，通过结合轻量级和强大模型，平衡成本与准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在推理过程中常出现错误，且难以遵循特定输出格式，导致预测不准确。

Method: EDCIM生成方程组，利用符号化错误检测框架识别错误并提供反馈，结合不同规模的模型优化效率。

Result: 实验表明，EDCIM显著降低成本和计算开销，同时保持或提高预测准确性。

Conclusion: EDCIM通过平衡模型选择，有效解决了数学任务中的错误问题。

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to perform
explicit multi-step reasoning such as chain-of-thought prompting. However,
their intermediate steps often contain errors that can propagate leading to
inaccurate final predictions. Additionally, LLMs still struggle with
hallucinations and often fail to adhere to prescribed output formats, which is
particularly problematic for tasks like generating mathematical expressions or
source code. This work introduces EDCIM (Error Detection and Correction for
Interpretable Mathematics), a method for detecting and correcting these errors
in interpretable mathematics tasks, where the model must generate the exact
functional form that explicitly solve the problem (expressed in natural
language) rather than a black-box solution. EDCIM uses LLMs to generate a
system of equations for a given problem, followed by a symbolic error-detection
framework that identifies errors and provides targeted feedback for LLM-based
correction. To optimize efficiency, EDCIM integrates lightweight, open-source
LLMs with more powerful proprietary models, balancing cost and accuracy. This
balance is controlled by a single hyperparameter, allowing users to control the
trade-off based on their cost and accuracy requirements. Experimental results
across different datasets show that EDCIM significantly reduces both
computational and financial costs, while maintaining, and even improving,
prediction accuracy when the balance is properly configured.

TL;DR: 论文分析了Transformer训练过程中大规模激活值的动态发展规律，发现其遵循可预测的数学模式，并提出了预测框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大规模激活值在训练过程中的动态发展规律，以预测和控制模型行为。

Method: 使用Pythia模型家族进行系统分析，提出基于指数调制对数函数的数学模型，并开发机器学习框架预测参数。

Result: 发现大规模激活值的发展遵循可预测模式，预测框架在稳态行为上表现高精度，在出现时间和幅度上表现中等精度。

Conclusion: 大规模激活值的出现受模型设计影响，可在训练前预测和控制，对模型稳定性、训练周期和优化有重要意义。

Abstract: Massive activations are scalar values in transformer hidden states that
achieve values orders of magnitude larger than typical activations and have
been shown to be critical for model functionality. While prior work has
characterized these phenomena in fully trained models, the temporal dynamics of
their emergence during training remain poorly understood. We present the first
comprehensive analysis of massive activation development throughout transformer
training, using the Pythia model family as our testbed. Through systematic
analysis of various model sizes across multiple training checkpoints, we
demonstrate that massive activation emergence follows predictable mathematical
patterns that can be accurately modeled using an exponentially-modulated
logarithmic function with five key parameters. We develop a machine learning
framework to predict these mathematical parameters from architectural
specifications alone, achieving high accuracy for steady-state behavior and
moderate accuracy for emergence timing and magnitude. These findings enable
architects to predict and potentially control key aspects of massive activation
emergence through design choices, with significant implications for model
stability, training cycle length, interpretability, and optimization. Our
findings demonstrate that the emergence of massive activations is governed by
model design and can be anticipated, and potentially controlled, before
training begins.

TL;DR: FPBench是首个针对代码生成中错误前提的评估框架，通过系统构建三类错误前提和多维评估指标，评估了15个代表性LLM，发现模型在错误前提下的表现不佳，揭示了其认知机制的三重分离。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代码生成能力的提升，其对输入前提的依赖加剧，错误前提易导致代码生成幻觉，暴露其自审能力不足。

Method: 提出FPBench框架，系统构建三类错误前提，结合多维评估指标，对15个LLM进行深入评估。

Result: (1)模型在错误前提下表现差；(2)错误前提导致资源投入边际效益递减；(3)三类错误前提分别激活不同缺陷模式。

Conclusion: 研究强调了LLM主动验证前提的紧迫性，FPBench为开发可靠、以人为本的代码生成模型提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: With the advancement of code generation capabilities in large language models
(LLMs), their reliance on input premises has intensified. When users provide
inputs containing faulty premises, the probability of code generation
hallucinations rises significantly, exposing deficiencies in their
self-scrutiny capabilities. This paper proposes Faulty Premises Bench
(FPBench), the first code generation evaluation framework targeting faulty
premises. By systematically constructing three categories of faulty premises
and integrating multi-dimensional evaluation metrics, it conducts in-depth
assessments of 15 representative LLMs. The key findings are as follows: (1)
Most models exhibit poor reasoning abilities and suboptimal code generation
performance under faulty premises, heavily relying on explicit prompts for
error detection, with limited self-scrutiny capabilities; (2) Faulty premises
trigger a point of diminishing returns in resource investment, leading to
blindly increasing length fails to enhance quality; (3) The three types of
faulty premises respectively activate distinct defect patterns in models,
revealing a triple dissociation in the cognitive mechanisms of code generation
models. This study not only highlights the urgent need for LLMs to proactively
verify premises in code generation but also, through the proposed FPBench
framework and multi-dimensional evaluation system, provides a theoretical
foundation and practical pathway for developing reliable, human-centric code
generation models.

Conclusion: Evo-MCTS不仅提升了性能，还提供了一种可迁移的自动算法发现方法，适用于更广泛的科学计算领域。

Abstract: Computational scientific discovery increasingly relies on algorithms to
process complex data and identify meaningful patterns - yet faces persistent
challenges in gravitational-wave signal identification. While existing
algorithmic approaches like matched filtering (MF) and deep neural networks
(DNNs) have achieved partial success, their limitations directly stem from
fundamental limitations: MF's excessive computational demands arise from its
reliance on predefined theoretical waveform templates, while DNNs' black-box
architectures obscure decision logic and introduce hidden biases. We propose
Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search (Evo-MCTS), a framework that addresses
these limitations through systematic algorithm space exploration guided by
domain-aware physical constraints. Our approach combines tree-structured search
with evolutionary optimization and large language model heuristics to create
interpretable algorithmic solutions. Our Evo-MCTS framework demonstrates
substantial improvements, achieving a 20.2\% improvement over state-of-the-art
gravitational wave detection algorithms on the MLGWSC-1 benchmark dataset.
High-performing algorithm variants consistently exceed thresholds. The
framework generates human-interpretable algorithmic pathways that reveal
distinct performance patterns. Beyond performance improvements, our framework
discovers novel algorithmic combinations, thereby establishing a transferable
methodology for automated algorithmic discovery across computational science
domains.

Conclusion: Agent Lightning为现实世界代理训练和部署提供了潜力。

Abstract: We present Agent Lightning, a flexible and extensible framework that enables
Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
any AI agent. Unlike existing methods that tightly couple RL training with
agent or rely on sequence concatenation with masking, Agent Lightning achieves
complete decoupling between agent execution and training, allowing seamless
integration with existing agents developed via diverse ways (e.g., using
frameworks like LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, AutoGen, and building from
scratch) with almost ZERO code modifications. By formulating agent execution as
Markov decision process, we define an unified data interface and propose a
hierarchical RL algorithm, LightningRL, which contains a credit assignment
module, allowing us to decompose trajectories generated by ANY agents into
training transition. This enables RL to handle complex interaction logic, such
as multi-agent scenarios and dynamic workflows. For the system design, we
introduce a Training-Agent Disaggregation architecture, and brings agent
observability frameworks into agent runtime, providing a standardized agent
finetuning interface. Experiments across text-to-SQL, retrieval-augmented
generation, and math tool-use tasks demonstrate stable, continuous
improvements, showcasing the framework's potential for real-world agent
training and deployment.

Result: 在情感分析、新闻分类等任务中表现优于现有PEFT基线，支持不确定性量化和动态适应。

Conclusion: BH-PEFT为商业分析和数据科学提供了一种支持不确定性感知和自适应决策的新方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in
reshaping the world. As these models are pretrained on general corpora, they
often require domain-specific fine-tuning to optimize performance in
specialized business applications. Due to their massive scale,
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are widely used to reduce
training costs. Among them, hybrid PEFT methods that combine multiple PEFT
techniques have achieved the best performance. However, existing hybrid PEFT
methods face two main challenges when fine-tuning LLMs for specialized
applications: (1) relying on point estimates, lacking the ability to quantify
uncertainty for reliable decision-making, and (2) struggling to dynamically
adapt to emerging data, lacking the ability to suit real-world situations. We
propose Bayesian Hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (BH-PEFT), a novel
method that integrates Bayesian learning into hybrid PEFT. BH-PEFT combines
Adapter, LoRA, and prefix-tuning to fine-tune feedforward and attention layers
of the Transformer. By modeling learnable parameters as distributions, BH-PEFT
enables uncertainty quantification. We further propose a Bayesian dynamic
fine-tuning approach where the last posterior serves as the prior for the next
round, enabling effective adaptation to new data. We evaluated BH-PEFT on
business tasks such as sentiment analysis, news categorization, and commonsense
reasoning. Results show that our method outperforms existing PEFT baselines,
enables uncertainty quantification for more reliable decisions, and improves
adaptability in dynamic scenarios. This work contributes to business analytics
and data science by proposing a novel BH-PEFT method and dynamic fine-tuning
approach that support uncertainty-aware and adaptive decision-making in
real-world situations.

Conclusion: ZetA是Adam的高效替代方案，适用于复杂或噪声环境下的深度学习任务。

Abstract: This work introduces ZetA, a novel deep learning optimizer that extends Adam
by incorporating dynamic scaling based on the Riemann zeta function. To the
best of our knowledge, ZetA is the first optimizer to apply zeta-based gradient
scaling within deep learning optimization. The method improves generalization
and robustness through a hybrid update mechanism that integrates adaptive
damping, cosine similarity-based momentum boosting, entropy-regularized loss,
and Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM)-style perturbations. Empirical
evaluations on SVHN, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, STL10, and noisy CIFAR10 consistently
show test accuracy improvements over Adam. All experiments employ a lightweight
fully connected network trained for five epochs under mixed-precision settings.
The results demonstrate that ZetA is a computationally efficient and robust
alternative to Adam, particularly effective in noisy or high-granularity
classification tasks.

Conclusion: ECGTwin为精准个性化医疗提供了可能。

Abstract: Personalized electrocardiogram (ECG) generation is to simulate a patient's
ECG digital twins tailored to specific conditions. It has the potential to
transform traditional healthcare into a more accurate individualized paradigm,
while preserving the key benefits of conventional population-level ECG
synthesis. However, this promising task presents two fundamental challenges:
extracting individual features without ground truth and injecting various types
of conditions without confusing generative model. In this paper, we present
ECGTwin, a two-stage framework designed to address these challenges. In the
first stage, an Individual Base Extractor trained via contrastive learning
robustly captures personal features from a reference ECG. In the second stage,
the extracted individual features, along with a target cardiac condition, are
integrated into the diffusion-based generation process through our novel AdaX
Condition Injector, which injects these signals via two dedicated and
specialized pathways. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments have
demonstrated that our model can not only generate ECG signals of high fidelity
and diversity by offering a fine-grained generation controllability, but also
preserving individual-specific features. Furthermore, ECGTwin shows the
potential to enhance ECG auto-diagnosis in downstream application, confirming
the possibility of precise personalized healthcare solutions.

Abstract: In this research, I explore advanced deep learning methodologies to forecast
the outcomes of the 2025 NCAA Division 1 Men's and Women's Basketball
tournaments. Leveraging historical NCAA game data, I implement two
sophisticated sequence-based models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and
Transformer architectures. The predictive power of these models is augmented
through comprehensive feature engineering, including team quality metrics
derived from Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Elo ratings, seed differences,
and aggregated box-score statistics. To evaluate the robustness and reliability
of predictions, I train each model variant using both Binary Cross-Entropy
(BCE) and Brier loss functions, providing insights into classification
performance and probability calibration. My comparative analysis reveals that
while the Transformer architecture optimized with BCE yields superior
discriminative power (highest AUC of 0.8473), the LSTM model trained with Brier
loss demonstrates superior probabilistic calibration (lowest Brier score of
0.1589). These findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriate
model architectures and loss functions based on the specific requirements of
forecasting tasks. The detailed analytical pipeline presented here serves as a

Motivation: FeFETs在内存和逻辑技术中有巨大潜力，但其随机性（来自操作循环和制造变异性）对建模提出了挑战，需要一种能全面捕捉变异性的方法。

Method: 采用混合密度网络（MDN）作为基础，结合C-infinity连续激活函数和设备特定的嵌入层，生成合成设备实例进行变异性感知模拟。

Conclusion: 该框架为FeFETs的随机行为建模提供了可扩展的数据驱动解决方案，并为未来紧凑模型开发和电路模拟集成奠定了基础。

Abstract: FeFETs hold strong potential for advancing memory and logic technologies, but
their inherent randomness arising from both operational cycling and fabrication
variability poses significant challenges for accurate and reliable modeling.
Capturing this variability is critical, as it enables designers to predict
behavior, optimize performance, and ensure reliability and robustness against
variations in manufacturing and operating conditions. Existing deterministic
and machine learning-based compact models often fail to capture the full extent
of this variability or lack the mathematical smoothness required for stable
circuit-level integration. In this work, we present an enhanced probabilistic
modeling framework for FeFETs that addresses these limitations. Building upon a
Mixture Density Network (MDN) foundation, our approach integrates C-infinity
continuous activation functions for smooth, stable learning and a
device-specific embedding layer to capture intrinsic physical variability
across devices. Sampling from the learned embedding distribution enables the
generation of synthetic device instances for variability-aware simulation. With
an R2 of 0.92, the model demonstrates high accuracy in capturing the
variability of FeFET current behavior. Altogether, this framework provides a
scalable, data-driven solution for modeling the full stochastic behavior of
FeFETs and offers a strong foundation for future compact model development and
circuit simulation integration.

Abstract: Large-scale tuberculosis (TB) screening is limited by the high cost and
operational complexity of traditional diagnostics, creating a need for
artificial-intelligence solutions. We propose DeepGB-TB, a non-invasive system
that instantly assigns TB risk scores using only cough audio and basic
demographic data. The model couples a lightweight one-dimensional convolutional
neural network for audio processing with a gradient-boosted decision tree for
tabular features. Its principal innovation is a Cross-Modal Bidirectional
Cross-Attention module (CM-BCA) that iteratively exchanges salient cues between
modalities, emulating the way clinicians integrate symptoms and risk factors.
To meet the clinical priority of minimizing missed cases, we design a
Tuberculosis Risk-Balanced Loss (TRBL) that places stronger penalties on
false-negative predictions, thereby reducing high-risk misclassifications.
DeepGB-TB is evaluated on a diverse dataset of 1,105 patients collected across
seven countries, achieving an AUROC of 0.903 and an F1-score of 0.851,
representing a new state of the art. Its computational efficiency enables
real-time, offline inference directly on common mobile devices, making it ideal

238Pu-9Be source, using metrics including Figure of Merit (FOM), F1-score,
ROC-AUC, and inter-method correlations. Our analysis reveals that deep learning
models, particularly Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and hybrid approaches
combining statistical features with neural regression, often outperform
traditional methods. We discuss architectural suitabilities, the limitations of
FOM, alternative evaluation metrics, and performance across energy thresholds.
Accompanying this work, we release an open-source toolbox in Python and MATLAB,
along with the datasets, to promote reproducibility and advance PSD research.

TL;DR: SmallKV通过小模型辅助补偿机制解决KV缓存淘汰中的注意力匹配问题，提升大模型在资源受限环境下的性能与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存淘汰方法存在不可逆淘汰策略和边际信息过度压缩问题，无法适应动态注意力模式。

Method: 设计两种补偿机制，利用不同规模LLM间注意力矩阵的高相似性，提出SmallKV方法。

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证SmallKV的有效性，吞吐量比基线方法高1.75-2.56倍。

Conclusion: SmallKV为资源受限环境下的高效LLM推理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: KV cache eviction has emerged as an effective solution to alleviate resource
constraints faced by LLMs in long-context scenarios. However, existing
token-level eviction methods often overlook two critical aspects: (1) their
irreversible eviction strategy fails to adapt to dynamic attention patterns
during decoding (the saliency shift problem), and (2) they treat both
marginally important tokens and truly unimportant tokens equally, despite the
collective significance of marginal tokens to model performance (the marginal
information over-compression problem). To address these issues, we design two
compensation mechanisms based on the high similarity of attention matrices
between LLMs of different scales. We propose SmallKV, a small model assisted
compensation method for KV cache compression. SmallKV can maintain attention
matching between different-scale LLMs to: 1) assist the larger model in
perceiving globally important information of attention; and 2) use the smaller
model's attention scores to approximate those of marginal tokens in the larger
model. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K, BBH, MT-Bench, and
LongBench demonstrate the effectiveness of SmallKV. Moreover, efficiency
evaluations show that SmallKV achieves 1.75 - 2.56 times higher throughput than
baseline methods, highlighting its potential for efficient and performant LLM
inference in resource constrained environments.

*Haonan Yang,Jianchao Tang,Zhuo Li,Long Lan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态多尺度协调框架（DMSC），通过多尺度块分解（EMPD）、三元交互块（TIB）和自适应尺度路由MoE块（ASR-MoE）解决时间序列预测中的静态分解、依赖建模和融合机制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在建模复杂时间依赖时存在静态分解策略、碎片化依赖建模和固定融合机制的局限性。

Method: DMSC框架包含EMPD（动态多尺度块分解）、TIB（联合建模依赖）和ASR-MoE（动态融合预测）。

Result: 在13个真实世界基准测试中，DMSC表现最优且计算高效。

Conclusion: DMSC通过动态多尺度协调显著提升了时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: Time Series Forecasting (TSF) faces persistent challenges in modeling
intricate temporal dependencies across different scales. Despite recent
advances leveraging different decomposition operations and novel architectures
based on CNN, MLP or Transformer, existing methods still struggle with static
decomposition strategies, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion
mechanisms, limiting their ability to model intricate temporal dependencies. To
explicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel
Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch
Decomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale
Routing MoE block (ASR-MoE). Specifically, EMPD is designed as a built-in
component to dynamically segment sequences into hierarchical patches with
exponentially scaled granularities, eliminating predefined scale constraints
through input-adaptive patch adjustment. TIB then jointly models intra-patch,
inter-patch, and cross-variable dependencies within each layer's decomposed
representations. EMPD and TIB are jointly integrated into layers forming a
multi-layer progressive cascade architecture, where coarse-grained
representations from earlier layers adaptively guide fine-grained feature
extraction in subsequent layers via gated pathways. And ASR-MoE dynamically
fuses multi-scale predictions by leveraging specialized global and local
experts with temporal-aware weighting. Comprehensive experiments on thirteen
real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DMSC consistently maintains
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and superior computational efficiency for
TSF tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/1327679995/DMSC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准CLIP模型依赖单一文本嵌入，无法充分捕捉文本的多样语义。

Method: 引入多个结构化提示，每个提示包含自适应令牌，结合多样性正则化和否定感知损失优化表示。

Result: 在图像-文本和视频-文本检索任务中表现优于基准模型。

Conclusion: 多提示嵌入方法能显著提升语义对齐和检索性能。

Abstract: We propose Context-Adaptive Multi-Prompt Embedding, a novel approach to
enrich semantic representations in vision-language contrastive learning. Unlike
standard CLIP-style models that rely on a single text embedding, our method
introduces multiple structured prompts, each containing a distinct adaptive
token that captures diverse semantic aspects of the input text. We process all
prompts jointly in a single forward pass. The resulting prompt embeddings are
combined into a unified text representation, enabling semantically richer
alignment with visual features. To further promote semantic diversity and
representation quality, we incorporate a diversity regularization loss and a
negation-aware loss, encouraging specialization across prompts and improving
contrastive discrimination. Our method achieves consistent improvements on both
image-text and video-text retrieval benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分布鲁棒评估和学习方法过于保守，导致评估和策略效果不佳。

Method: 使用结构方程模型（SEM）和条件独立性检验，定制问题特定的不确定性集。

Result: SEM方法提供了更准确的评估和低方差策略，尤其在大偏移情况下表现更好。

Conclusion: SEM方法在模型充分指定的情况下能学习到最优策略。

Abstract: Distributionally robust evaluation estimates the worst-case expected return
over an uncertainty set of possible covariate and reward distributions, and
distributionally robust learning finds a policy that maximizes that worst-case
return across that uncertainty set. Unfortunately, current methods for
distributionally robust evaluation and learning create overly conservative
evaluations and policies. In this work, we propose a practical bandit
evaluation and learning algorithm that tailors the uncertainty set to specific
problems using mathematical programs constrained by structural equation models.
Further, we show how conditional independence testing can be used to detect
shifted variables for modeling. We find that the structural equation model
(SEM) approach gives more accurate evaluations and learns lower-variance
policies than traditional approaches, particularly for large shifts. Further,
the SEM approach learns an optimal policy, assuming the model is sufficiently
well-specified.

TL;DR: GRPO是一种无批评的强化学习算法，用于微调大型语言模型，通过组归一化奖励替代PPO中的价值函数。研究发现GRPO的更新规则实际上是在旧策略上估计策略梯度，而非当前策略。通过简化实验验证后，提出了一种新算法TIC GRPO，使用轨迹级概率比替代令牌级重要性比，保持无批评结构的同时提供无偏估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GRPO算法的实际效果及其偏差问题，探索更高效的无批评强化学习方法。

Method: GRPO用组归一化奖励替代PPO的价值函数，保留基于旧策略的令牌级重要性采样。通过实验验证偏差影响后，提出TIC GRPO算法，使用轨迹级概率比。

Result: 实验表明，简化后的GRPO性能与标准GRPO相当。TIC GRPO提供了无偏估计，并保持了无批评结构。

Conclusion: GRPO的偏差在实践中影响有限，TIC GRPO进一步优化了算法，提供了理论收敛分析。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), recently proposed by DeepSeek, is
a critic-free reinforcement learning algorithm for fine tuning large language
models. It replaces the value function in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
with group normalized rewards, while retaining PPO style token level importance
sampling based on an old policy. We show that GRPO update rule in fact
estimates the policy gradient at the old policy rather than the current one.
However, since the old policy is refreshed every few steps, the discrepancy
between the two remains small limiting the impact of this bias in practice. We
validate this through an ablation study in which importance sampling is
entirely removed, and updates are instead performed using the gradient
estimated at a fixed old policy across multiple optimization steps. Remarkably,
this simplification results in performance comparable to standard GRPO.
  Motivated by these findings, we propose a new algorithm: Trajectory level
Importance Corrected GRPO (TIC GRPO). TIC GRPO replaces token level importance
ratios with a single trajectory level probability ratio, yielding an unbiased
estimate of the current policy gradient while preserving the critic free
structure. Furthermore, we present the first theoretical convergence analysis
for GRPO style methods, covering both the original GRPO and our proposed
variant.

Conclusion: 该框架为抗体设计提供了个性化迭代优化范式，适用于从微小表位到大蛋白界面的多样化设计挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have shown remarkable potential for
antibody design, yet existing approaches apply uniform generation strategies
that cannot adapt to each antigen's unique requirements. Inspired by B cell
affinity maturation, where antibodies evolve through multi-objective
optimization balancing affinity, stability, and self-avoidance, we propose the
first biologically-motivated framework that leverages physics-based domain
knowledge within an online meta-learning system. Our method employs multiple
specialized experts (van der Waals, molecular recognition, energy balance, and
interface geometry) whose parameters evolve during generation based on
iterative feedback, mimicking natural antibody refinement cycles. Instead of
fixed protocols, this adaptive guidance discovers personalized optimization
strategies for each target. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach: (1)
discovers optimal SE(3)-equivariant guidance strategies for different antigen
classes without pre-training, preserving molecular symmetries throughout
optimization; (2) significantly enhances hotspot coverage and interface quality
through target-specific adaptation, achieving balanced multi-objective
optimization characteristic of therapeutic antibodies; (3) establishes a
paradigm for iterative refinement where each antibody-antigen system learns its
unique optimization profile through online evaluation; (4) generalizes
effectively across diverse design challenges, from small epitopes to large
protein interfaces, enabling precision-focused campaigns for individual
targets.

Result: 在基准数据集上验证了方法的有效性，性能接近原始RAG系统。

Conclusion: 提出的防御方法能有效缓解PoisonedRAG攻击，同时保持RAG系统的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful approach to
boost the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating
external, up-to-date knowledge sources. However, this introduces a potential
vulnerability to knowledge poisoning attacks, where attackers can compromise
the knowledge source to mislead the generation model. One such attack is the
PoisonedRAG in which the injected adversarial texts steer the model to generate
an attacker-chosen response to a target question. In this work, we propose
novel defense methods, FilterRAG and ML-FilterRAG, to mitigate the PoisonedRAG
attack. First, we propose a new property to uncover distinct properties to
differentiate between adversarial and clean texts in the knowledge data source.
Next, we employ this property to filter out adversarial texts from clean ones
in the design of our proposed approaches. Evaluation of these methods using
benchmark datasets demonstrate their effectiveness, with performances close to
those of the original RAG systems.

Motivation: 软件系统复杂性增加导致网络安全漏洞激增，需要高效且可扩展的漏洞评估方案，但大型预训练模型的计算和存储需求限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) 粒子群优化优化紧凑学生模型架构；2) 知识蒸馏将关键知识从大型教师模型迁移至学生模型。

Result: 在增强版MegaVul数据集上，模型尺寸减少99.4%，保留89.3%准确率，训练时间减少72.1%，架构搜索时间减少34.88%。

Conclusion: 该框架在资源受限环境下实现了高效漏洞评估，性能优于现有基线。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of software systems has led to a surge in
cybersecurity vulnerabilities, necessitating efficient and scalable solutions
for vulnerability assessment. However, the deployment of large pre-trained
models in real-world scenarios is hindered by their substantial computational
and storage demands. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
resource-efficient framework that integrates knowledge distillation and
particle swarm optimization to enable automated vulnerability assessment. Our
framework employs a two-stage approach: First, particle swarm optimization is
utilized to optimize the architecture of a compact student model, balancing
computational efficiency and model capacity. Second, knowledge distillation is
applied to transfer critical vulnerability assessment knowledge from a large
teacher model to the optimized student model. This process significantly
reduces the model size while maintaining high performance. Experimental results
on an enhanced MegaVul dataset, comprising 12,071 CVSS (Common Vulnerability
Scoring System) v3 annotated vulnerabilities, demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach. Our approach achieves a 99.4% reduction in model size while
retaining 89.3% of the original model's accuracy. Furthermore, it outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by 1.7% in accuracy with 60% fewer parameters. The
framework also reduces training time by 72.1% and architecture search time by
34.88% compared to traditional genetic algorithms.

TL;DR: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) 作为参数高效且灵活的神经网络替代方案，在无监督故障检测中表现出色，尤其是 WavKAN-AE 和 EfficientKAN-AE 在数据量较少时仍能保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索 KANs 在无监督故障检测中的潜力，尤其是在化学过程中，以解决传统方法在数据效率和性能上的不足。

Method: 比较四种 KAN-AE 变体（EfficientKAN、FastKAN、FourierKAN 和 WavKAN）与正交自编码器（OAE）在 Tennessee Eastman Process 上的表现，使用故障检测率（FDR）作为指标。

Result: WavKAN-AE 在 4,000 样本时 FDR ≥92%，表现最佳；EfficientKAN-AE 在 500 样本时 FDR ≥90%；FastKAN-AE 在大规模数据时表现接近；FourierKAN-AE 表现较差。

Conclusion: KAN-AEs 在数据效率和故障检测性能上具有优势，尤其在数据受限的工业场景中潜力巨大。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a flexible and
parameter-efficient alternative to conventional neural networks. Unlike
standard architectures that use fixed node-based activations, KANs place
learnable functions on edges, parameterized by different function families.
While they have shown promise in supervised settings, their utility in
unsupervised fault detection remains largely unexplored. This study presents a
comparative evaluation of KAN-based autoencoders (KAN-AEs) for unsupervised
fault detection in chemical processes. We investigate four KAN-AE variants,
each based on a different KAN implementation (EfficientKAN, FastKAN,
FourierKAN, and WavKAN), and benchmark them against an Orthogonal Autoencoder
(OAE) on the Tennessee Eastman Process. Models are trained on normal operating
data across 13 training set sizes and evaluated on 21 fault types, using Fault
Detection Rate (FDR) as the performance metric. WavKAN-AE achieves the highest
overall FDR ($\geq$92\%) using just 4,000 training samples and remains the top
performer, even as other variants are trained on larger datasets.
EfficientKAN-AE reaches $\geq$90\% FDR with only 500 samples, demonstrating
robustness in low-data settings. FastKAN-AE becomes competitive at larger
scales ($\geq$50,000 samples), while FourierKAN-AE consistently underperforms.
The OAE baseline improves gradually but requires substantially more data to
match top KAN-AE performance. These results highlight the ability of KAN-AEs to
combine data efficiency with strong fault detection performance. Their use of
structured basis functions suggests potential for improved model transparency,
making them promising candidates for deployment in data-constrained industrial
settings.

Motivation: 传统最小二乘回归在高斯噪声下表现良好，但在非对称结构化噪声下效果不佳，需要更鲁棒的方法。

Method: 结合Transformer编码器处理数值序列，压缩神经网络预测符号参数，固定符号方程重建序列。

Result: 在合成可穿戴数据上，模型的中位回归MSE为6e-6至3.5e-5，比普通最小二乘和鲁棒回归方法提升10-300倍。

Conclusion: 混合神经符号架构能有效处理非对称结构化噪声，显著优于传统回归方法。

Abstract: Robust regression techniques rely on least-squares optimization, which works
well for Gaussian noise but fails in the presence of asymmetric structured
noise. We propose a hybrid neural-symbolic architecture where a transformer
encoder processes numerical sequences, a compression NN predicts symbolic
parameters, and a fixed symbolic equation reconstructs the original sequence.
Using synthetic data, the training objective is to recover the original
sequence after adding asymmetric structured noise, effectively learning a
symbolic fit guided by neural parameter estimation. Our model achieves a median
regression MSE of 6e-6 to 3.5e-5 on synthetic wearable data, which is a 10-300
times improvement when compared with ordinary least squares fit and robust
regression techniques such as Huber loss or SoftL1.

Conclusion: CauKer为TSFMs的高效预训练提供了可行方案，并展示了合成数据的优势。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have recently gained significant
attention due to their strong zero-shot capabilities and widespread real-world
applications. Such models typically require a computationally costly
pretraining on large-scale, carefully curated collections of real-world
sequences. To allow for a sample-efficient pretraining of TSFMs, we propose
CauKer, a novel algorithm designed to generate diverse, causally coherent
synthetic time series with realistic trends, seasonality, and nonlinear
interactions. CauKer combines Gaussian Process (GP) kernel composition with
Structural Causal Models (SCM) to produce data for sample-efficient pretraining
of state-of-the-art classification TSFMs having different architectures and
following different pretraining approaches. Additionally, our experiments
reveal that CauKer-generated datasets exhibit clear scaling laws for both
dataset size (10K to 10M samples) and model capacity (1M to 783M parameters),
unlike real-world datasets, which display irregular scaling behavior.

Result: 实验证明，初始化时雅可比正交性足以稳定训练并达到竞争性性能，且与正则化方法效果相当。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅涵盖标准架构，还扩展了部分等距网络，展示了良好的可训练性。

Abstract: Very deep neural networks achieve state-of-the-art performance by extracting
rich, hierarchical features. Yet, training them via backpropagation is often
hindered by vanishing or exploding gradients. Existing remedies, such as
orthogonal or variance-preserving initialisation and residual architectures,
allow for a more stable gradient propagation and the training of deeper models.
In this work, we introduce a unified mathematical framework that describes a
broad class of nonlinear feedforward and residual networks, whose
input-to-output Jacobian matrices are exactly orthogonal almost everywhere.
Such a constraint forces the resulting networks to achieve perfect dynamical
isometry and train efficiently despite being very deep. Our formulation not
only recovers standard architectures as particular cases but also yields new
designs that match the trainability of residual networks without relying on
conventional skip connections. We provide experimental evidence that perfect
Jacobian orthogonality at initialisation is sufficient to stabilise training
and achieve competitive performance. We compare this strategy to networks
regularised to maintain the Jacobian orthogonality and obtain comparable
results. We further extend our analysis to a class of networks
well-approximated by those with orthogonal Jacobians and introduce networks
with Jacobians representing partial isometries. These generalized models are
then showed to maintain the favourable trainability properties.

Abstract: Edge Digital Twins (EDTs) are crucial for monitoring and control of Power
Electronics Systems (PES). However, existing modeling approaches struggle to
consistently capture continuously evolving hybrid dynamics that are inherent in
PES, degrading Sim-to-Real generalization on resource-constrained edge devices.
To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Physics-Embedded Neural ODEs
(PENODE) that (i) embeds the hybrid operating mechanism as an event automaton
to explicitly govern discrete switching and (ii) injects known governing ODE
components directly into the neural parameterization of unmodeled dynamics.
This unified design yields a differentiable end-to-end trainable architecture
that preserves physical interpretability while reducing redundancy, and it
supports a cloud-to-edge toolchain for efficient FPGA deployment. Experimental
results demonstrate that PENODE achieves significantly higher accuracy in
benchmarks in white-box, gray-box, and black-box scenarios, with a 75%
reduction in neuron count, validating that the proposed PENODE maintains
physical interpretability, efficient edge deployment, and real-time control
enhancement.

Conclusion: 结论指出该工作存在一定局限性，并提出了未来可能的研究方向。

Abstract: We study a stochastic multi-armed bandit setting where arms are partitioned
into known clusters, such that the mean rewards of arms within a cluster differ
by at most a known threshold. While the clustering structure is known a priori,
the arm means are unknown. This framework models scenarios where outcomes
depend on multiple factors -- some with significant and others with minor
influence -- such as online advertising, clinical trials, and wireless
communication. We derive asymptotic lower bounds on the regret that improve
upon the classical bound of Lai & Robbins (1985). We then propose Clus-UCB, an
efficient algorithm that closely matches this lower bound asymptotically.
Clus-UCB is designed to exploit the clustering structure and introduces a new
index to evaluate an arm, which depends on other arms within the cluster. In
this way, arms share information among each other. We present simulation
results of our algorithm and compare its performance against KL-UCB and other
well-known algorithms for bandits with dependent arms. Finally, we address some
limitations of this work and conclude by mentioning possible future research.

Abstract: In trajectory design, fuel consumption and trajectory reachability are two
key performance indicators for low-thrust missions. This paper proposes
general-purpose pretrained neural networks to predict these metrics. The
contributions of this paper are as follows: Firstly, based on the confirmation
of the Scaling Law applicable to low-thrust trajectory approximation, the
largest dataset is constructed using the proposed homotopy ray method, which
aligns with mission-design-oriented data requirements. Secondly, the data are
transformed into a self-similar space, enabling the neural network to adapt to
arbitrary semi-major axes, inclinations, and central bodies. This extends the
applicability beyond existing studies and can generalize across diverse mission
scenarios without retraining. Thirdly, to the best of our knowledge, this work
presents the current most general and accurate low-thrust trajectory
approximator, with implementations available in C++, Python, and MATLAB. The
resulting neural network achieves a relative error of 0.78% in predicting
velocity increments and 0.63% in minimum transfer time estimation. The models
have also been validated on a third-party dataset, multi-flyby mission design
problem, and mission analysis scenario, demonstrating their generalization
capability, predictive accuracy, and computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型的评估方法过于静态，无法适应动态用户需求和现实变化，GrandJury旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用时间衰减聚合、完整追溯性、动态透明的任务评分标准和多评分者人工判断。

Result: 提供了一个开源实现（grandjury PyPI包）和公开的LLM推理输出集合，展示了方法的必要性和有效性。

Conclusion: GrandJury为AI从业者提供了一种在没有绝对真实值的情况下评估机器学习输出的新范式。

Abstract: Generative Machine Learning models have become central to modern systems,
powering applications in creative writing, summarization, multi-hop reasoning,
and context-aware dialogue. These models underpin large-scale AI assistants,
workflow automation, and autonomous decision-making. In such domains,
acceptable response is rarely absolute or static, but plural and highly
context-dependent. Yet standard evaluation regimes still rely on static,
benchmark-style tests, incentivizing optimization toward leaderboard scores
rather than alignment with dynamic user needs or evolving realities. GrandJury
introduces a formal evaluation protocol combining time-decayed aggregation,
complete traceability, with the support of dynamic, transparent task rubric
attribution, and multi-rater human judgment. Together, these elements enable
pluralistic, accountable evaluation that captures evolving consensus and
surfaces disagreement. We provide an open-source implementation (grandjury PyPI
package) and a public collection of Large Language Model (LLM) inference
outputs to illustrate the need and method. GrandJury provides a new paradigm
for AI practitioners when evaluating machine learning outputs without absolute
ground truth.

Result: PLoRA将LoRA微调时间缩短7.52倍，训练吞吐量提升12.8倍。

Conclusion: PLoRA显著提升了LoRA微调的效率和性能。

Abstract: Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained popularity as a fine-tuning approach
for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to its low resource requirements and good
performance. While a plethora of work has investigated improving LoRA serving
efficiency by serving multiple LoRAs concurrently, existing methods assume that
a wide range of LoRA adapters are available for serving. In our work, we
conduct extensive empirical studies to identify that current training paradigms
do not utilize hardware resources efficiently and require high overhead to
obtain a performant LoRA. Leveraging these insights, we propose PLoRA, which
automatically orchestrates concurrent LoRA fine-tuning jobs under given
hardware and model constraints and develops performant kernels to improve
training efficiency. Our experimental studies show that PLoRA reduces the
makespan of LoRA fine-tuning over a given hyperparameter search space by up to
7.52x and improves training throughput by up to 12.8x across a range of
state-of-the-art LLMs.

Result: 算法在总变差散度和KL散度度量的不确定性集合下，实现低遗憾并找到最优鲁棒策略。

Conclusion: 为开发真正鲁棒的多智能体系统提供了新路径。

Abstract: Well-trained multi-agent systems can fail when deployed in real-world
environments due to model mismatches between the training and deployment
environments, caused by environment uncertainties including noise or
adversarial attacks. Distributionally Robust Markov Games (DRMGs) enhance
system resilience by optimizing for worst-case performance over a defined set
of environmental uncertainties. However, current methods are limited by their
dependence on simulators or large offline datasets, which are often
unavailable. This paper pioneers the study of online learning in DRMGs, where
agents learn directly from environmental interactions without prior data. We
introduce the {\it Robust Optimistic Nash Value Iteration (RONAVI)} algorithm
and provide the first provable guarantees for this setting. Our theoretical
analysis demonstrates that the algorithm achieves low regret and efficiently
finds the optimal robust policy for uncertainty sets measured by Total
Variation divergence and Kullback-Leibler divergence. These results establish a
new, practical path toward developing truly robust multi-agent systems.

Result: 在多个数据集和任务中表现优于或与现有逆问题求解器相当。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了扩散模型在逆问题中的效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been firmly established as principled zero-shot solvers
for linear and nonlinear inverse problems, owing to their powerful image prior
and iterative sampling algorithm. These approaches often rely on Tweedie's
formula, which relates the diffusion variate $\mathbf{x}_t$ to the posterior
mean $\mathbb{E} [\mathbf{x}_0 | \mathbf{x}_t]$, in order to guide the
diffusion trajectory with an estimate of the final denoised sample
$\mathbf{x}_0$. However, this does not consider information from the
measurement $\mathbf{y}$, which must then be integrated downstream. In this
work, we propose to estimate the conditional posterior mean $\mathbb{E}
[\mathbf{x}_0 | \mathbf{x}_t, \mathbf{y}]$, which can be formulated as the
solution to a lightweight, single-parameter maximum likelihood estimation
problem. The resulting prediction can be integrated into any standard sampler,
resulting in a fast and memory-efficient inverse solver. Our optimizer is
amenable to a noise-aware likelihood-based stopping criteria that is robust to
measurement noise in $\mathbf{y}$. We demonstrate comparable or improved
performance against a wide selection of contemporary inverse solvers across
multiple datasets and tasks.

neighborhood graphs that adapt to local density variations. Our method formally
connects density-based clustering with graph connectivity, enabling the use of
efficient graph propagation techniques developed in network science. To ensure
scalability, we introduce a density-aware neighborhood propagation algorithm
and leverage advanced random projection methods to construct approximate
neighborhood graphs. Our approach significantly reduces computational cost
while preserving clustering quality. Empirically, it scales to datasets with
millions of points in minutes and achieves competitive accuracy compared to

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny-ImageNet上，DFedCAD性能最优，通信开销减少86%。

Conclusion: DFedCAD为动态现实场景中的高效去中心化学习提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) struggles with the slow adaptation of
late-joining delayed clients and high communication costs in asynchronous
environments. These limitations significantly hinder overall performance. To
address this, we propose DFedCAD, a novel framework for rapid adaptation via
Centroid-Aligned Distillation. DFedCAD first employs Weighted Cluster Pruning
(WCP) to compress models into representative centroids, drastically reducing
communication overhead. It then enables delayed clients to intelligently weigh
and align with peer knowledge using a novel structural distance metric and a
differentiable k-means distillation module, facilitating efficient end-to-end
knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
Tiny-ImageNet show that DFedCAD consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance, attaining the highest accuracy across all evaluated settings while
reducing communication overhead by over 86%. Our framework provides a scalable
and practical solution for efficient decentralized learning in dynamic,
real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Shapley值的混合精度量化方法（SMPQ），通过直接测量比特宽度对任务性能的贡献，优于传统的梯度下降方法（DMPQ）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的混合精度量化方法（MPQ）通常通过梯度下降优化比特宽度分配，但量化参数的大小并不能准确反映比特宽度对性能的实际贡献。

Method: 提出SMPQ方法，利用Shapley值直接测量比特宽度的贡献，并通过蒙特卡洛采样降低计算成本。

Result: 在主流基准测试中，SMPQ表现优于基于梯度的竞争对手，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SMPQ通过更准确的比特宽度贡献评估，显著提升了混合精度量化的性能。

Abstract: Mixed precision quantization (MPQ) is an effective quantization approach to
achieve accuracy-complexity trade-off of neural network, through assigning
different bit-widths to network activations and weights in each layer. The
typical way of existing MPQ methods is to optimize quantization policies (i.e.,
bit-width allocation) in a gradient descent manner, termed as Differentiable
(DMPQ). At the end of the search, the bit-width associated to the quantization
parameters which has the largest value will be selected to form the final mixed
precision quantization policy, with the implicit assumption that the values of
quantization parameters reflect the operation contribution to the accuracy
improvement. While much has been discussed about the MPQ improvement, the
bit-width selection process has received little attention. We study this
problem and argue that the magnitude of quantization parameters does not
necessarily reflect the actual contribution of the bit-width to the task
performance. Then, we propose a Shapley-based MPQ (SMPQ) method, which measures
the bit-width operation direct contribution on the MPQ task. To reduce
computation cost, a Monte Carlo sampling-based approximation strategy is
proposed for Shapley computation. Extensive experiments on mainstream
benchmarks demonstrate that our SMPQ consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance than gradient-based competitors.

Conclusion: 提出的单阶段框架和扩散建模模块有效，实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Urban profiling aims to predict urban profiles in unknown regions and plays a
critical role in economic and social censuses. Existing approaches typically
follow a two-stage paradigm: first, learning representations of urban areas;
second, performing downstream prediction via linear probing, which originates
from the BERT era. Inspired by the development of GPT style models, recent
studies have shown that novel self-supervised pretraining schemes can endow
models with direct applicability to downstream tasks, thereby eliminating the
need for task-specific fine-tuning. This is largely because GPT unifies the
form of pretraining and inference through next-token prediction. However, urban
data exhibit structural characteristics that differ fundamentally from
language, making it challenging to design a one-stage model that unifies both
pretraining and inference. In this work, we propose Urban In-Context Learning,
a framework that unifies pretraining and inference via a masked autoencoding
process over urban regions. To capture the distribution of urban profiles, we
introduce the Urban Masked Diffusion Transformer, which enables each region' s
prediction to be represented as a distribution rather than a deterministic
value. Furthermore, to stabilize diffusion training, we propose the Urban
Representation Alignment Mechanism, which regularizes the model's intermediate
features by aligning them with those from classical urban profiling methods.
Extensive experiments on three indicators across two cities demonstrate that
our one-stage method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art two-stage
approaches. Ablation studies and case studies further validate the
effectiveness of each proposed module, particularly the use of diffusion
modeling.

Result: 多模态方法提高了诊断的鲁棒性，能够在疾病早期阶段识别阿尔茨海默病，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有望革新阿尔茨海默病的早期检测，为更及时有效的治疗铺平道路。

Abstract: Alzheimers Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that
poses significant challenges in its early diagnosis, often leading to delayed
treatment and poorer outcomes for patients. Traditional diagnostic methods,
typically reliant on single data modalities, fall short of capturing the
multifaceted nature of the disease. In this paper, we propose a novel
multimodal framework for the early detection of AD that integrates data from
three primary sources: MRI imaging, cognitive assessments, and biomarkers. This
framework employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for analyzing MRI images
and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for processing cognitive and
biomarker data. The system enhances diagnostic accuracy and reliability by
aggregating results from these distinct modalities using advanced techniques
like weighted averaging, even in incomplete data. The multimodal approach not
only improves the robustness of the detection process but also enables the
identification of AD at its earliest stages, offering a significant advantage
over conventional methods. The integration of biomarkers and cognitive tests is
particularly crucial, as these can detect Alzheimer's long before the onset of
clinical symptoms, thereby facilitating earlier intervention and potentially
altering the course of the disease. This research demonstrates that the
proposed framework has the potential to revolutionize the early detection of
AD, paving the way for more timely and effective treatments

TL;DR: VRPO提出了一种基于价值模型的强化学习框架，通过熵和困惑度辅助损失以及变分信息瓶颈，有效减少噪声对策略优化的影响。


<details>

Motivation: 现实场景中的人类反馈强化学习（RLHF）常受噪声或低质量奖励信号的干扰，影响策略稳定性和泛化能力。现有方法多关注奖励去噪或数据过滤，而忽略了价值模型的关键作用。

Method: VRPO框架结合了两种核心设计：1）基于冻结语言模型的熵和困惑度辅助损失；2）变分信息瓶颈。这些机制增强了价值模型在优势估计中过滤噪声和捕捉关键信息的能力。

Result: 在数学推理、科学问答和多轮对话任务中，VRPO在规则和模型生成的噪声奖励下均优于PPO和GRPO基线。

Conclusion: 研究强调了价值模型在RLHF中的重要性，并提供了一种在噪声环境下实现稳健策略优化的实用方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often suffers from noisy or
imperfect reward supervision in real-world settings, which undermines policy
stability and generalization. Such noise may cause models to lose attention on
key words during advantage estimation. While prior work focuses on reward
denoising or filtering poor data, it often overlooks the critical role of the
value model in policy optimization. In this work, we show that a strong value
model is essential for mitigating noise by absorbing unstable signals and
enabling more reliable advantage estimation. We propose VRPO, a value-centric
framework for robust PPO training under noisy supervision. VRPO combines two
core designs: (1) an auxiliary loss guided by entropy and perplexity from a
frozen language model, and (2) a variational information bottleneck. These
mechanisms enhance the value model's ability to filter out noise and capture
key words from the context during advantage estimation, transforming it from a
passive predictor into an active regulator of noise. Experiments on math
reasoning, science QA, and multi-turn dialogue, under both rule-based and
model-based noisy rewards, show that VRPO consistently outperforms PPO and GRPO
baselines. Our findings underscore the often-overlooked importance of the value
model in RLHF and offer a principled and practical approach to robust policy
optimization in noisy real-world environments.

Motivation: 现实世界中的挑战和实用性需求促使开发有限适应性的算法，即仅允许有限次数的策略更新。

Method: 提出两种算法：B-MNL-CB（批处理设置）和RS-MNL（罕见切换设置），分别针对随机和对抗性上下文生成场景。

Result: B-MNL-CB在随机上下文下实现$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$遗憾，RS-MNL在对抗性上下文下同样实现$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$遗憾。实验表明算法性能优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在有限策略更新下表现优异，适用于多种实际场景。

Abstract: Multinomial Logistic Bandits have recently attracted much attention due to
their ability to model problems with multiple outcomes. In this setting, each
decision is associated with many possible outcomes, modeled using a multinomial
logit function. Several recent works on multinomial logistic bandits have
simultaneously achieved optimal regret and computational efficiency. However,
motivated by real-world challenges and practicality, there is a need to develop
algorithms with limited adaptivity, wherein we are allowed only $M$ policy
updates. To address these challenges, we present two algorithms, B-MNL-CB and
RS-MNL, that operate in the batched and rarely-switching paradigms,
respectively. The batched setting involves choosing the $M$ policy update
rounds at the start of the algorithm, while the rarely-switching setting can
choose these $M$ policy update rounds in an adaptive fashion. Our first
algorithm, B-MNL-CB extends the notion of distributional optimal designs to the
multinomial setting and achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret assuming the
contexts are generated stochastically when presented with $\Omega(\log \log T)$
update rounds. Our second algorithm, RS-MNL works with adversarially generated
contexts and can achieve $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret with $\tilde{O}(\log T)$
policy updates. Further, we conducted experiments that demonstrate that our
algorithms (with a fixed number of policy updates) are extremely competitive
(and often better) than several state-of-the-art baselines (which update their
policy every round), showcasing the applicability of our algorithms in various
practical scenarios.

Result: 实验证明HiTeC在TAHGs上的有效性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: HiTeC通过改进文本编码和对比学习策略，显著提升了TAHGs的自监督学习效果。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has become a dominant paradigm for self-supervised
hypergraph learning, enabling effective training without costly labels.
However, node entities in real-world hypergraphs are often associated with rich
textual information, which is overlooked in prior works. Directly applying
existing CL-based methods to such text-attributed hypergraphs (TAHGs) leads to
three key limitations: (1) The common use of graph-agnostic text encoders
overlooks the correlations between textual content and hypergraph topology,
resulting in suboptimal representations. (2) Their reliance on random data
augmentations introduces noise and weakens the contrastive objective. (3) The
primary focus on node- and hyperedge-level contrastive signals limits the
ability to capture long-range dependencies, which is essential for expressive
representation learning. Although HyperBERT pioneers CL on TAHGs, its
co-training paradigm suffers from poor scalability. To fill the research gap,
we introduce HiTeC, a two-stage hierarchical contrastive learning framework
with semantic-aware augmentation for scalable and effective self-supervised
learning on TAHGs. In the first stage, we pre-train the text encoder with a
structure-aware contrastive objective to overcome the graph-agnostic nature of
conventional methods. In the second stage, we introduce two semantic-aware
augmentation strategies, including prompt-enhanced text augmentation and
semantic-aware hyperedge drop, to facilitate informative view generation.
Furthermore, we propose a multi-scale contrastive loss that extends existing
objectives with an $s$-walk-based subgraph-level contrast to better capture
long-range dependencies. By decoupling text encoder pretraining from hypergraph
contrastive learning, this two-stage design enhances scalability without
compromising representation quality. Extensive experiments confirm the
effectiveness of HiTeC.

Motivation: 研究SGDM在动态调度下的收敛行为，为深度学习训练提供高效稳定的理论基础和实用指导。

Method: 提出一种结构更简单的Lyapunov函数，扩展理论框架以涵盖三种常见动态调度策略。

Result: 理论结果显示策略（ii）和（iii）能保证梯度范数收敛，且（iii）收敛速度更快；实验验证动态调度SGDM优于固定超参数基线。

Conclusion: 研究为深度学习训练提供了统一的理论基础和实用设计指南。

Abstract: We analyze the convergence behavior of stochastic gradient descent with
momentum (SGDM) under dynamic learning rate and batch size schedules by
introducing a novel Lyapunov function. This Lyapunov function has a simpler
structure compared with existing ones, facilitating the challenging convergence
analysis of SGDM and a unified analysis across various dynamic schedules.
Specifically, we extend the theoretical framework to cover three practical
scheduling strategies commonly used in deep learning: (i) constant batch size
with a decaying learning rate, (ii) increasing batch size with a decaying
learning rate, and (iii) increasing batch size with an increasing learning
rate. Our theoretical results reveal a clear hierarchy in convergence behavior:
while (i) does not guarantee convergence of the expected gradient norm, both
(ii) and (iii) do. Moreover, (iii) achieves a provably faster decay rate than
(i) and (ii), demonstrating theoretical acceleration even in the presence of
momentum. Empirical results validate our theory, showing that dynamically
scheduled SGDM significantly outperforms fixed-hyperparameter baselines in
convergence speed. We also evaluated a warm-up schedule in experiments, which
empirically outperformed all other strategies in convergence behavior. These
findings provide a unified theoretical foundation and practical guidance for
designing efficient and stable training procedures in modern deep learning.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection lies at the heart of robust artificial
intelligence (AI), aiming to identify samples from novel distributions beyond
the training set. Recent approaches have exploited feature representations as
distinguishing signatures for OOD detection. However, most existing methods
rely on restrictive assumptions on the feature space that limit the
separability between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. In this work, we
propose a novel OOD detection framework based on a pseudo-label-induced
subspace representation, that works under more relaxed and natural assumptions
compared to existing feature-based techniques. In addition, we introduce a
simple yet effective learning criterion that integrates a cross-entropy-based
ID classification loss with a subspace distance-based regularization loss to
enhance ID-OOD separability. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness
of our framework.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的图神经网络框架，通过监督和无监督训练近似图编辑距离（GED），改进了适应性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GED计算是NP难问题，现有神经网络方法假设单位成本编辑操作，不适用于实际应用。

Method: 结合监督和无监督训练，采用梯度自组织机制和广义加性模型学习上下文感知编辑成本。

Result: 实验表明，该方法性能与现有方法相当，但显著提升了适应性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法在分子分析和结构模式发现等领域具有重要价值。

Abstract: Graph Edit Distance (GED) is defined as the minimum cost transformation of
one graph into another and is a widely adopted metric for measuring the
dissimilarity between graphs. The major problem of GED is that its computation
is NP-hard, which has in turn led to the development of various approximation
methods, including approaches based on neural networks (NN). Most of these
NN-based models simplify the problem of GED by assuming unit-cost edit
operations, a rather unrealistic constraint in real-world applications. In this
work, we present a novel Graph Neural Network framework that approximates GED
using both supervised and unsupervised training. In the unsupervised setting,
it employs a gradient-only self-organizing mechanism that enables optimization
without ground-truth distances. Moreover, a core component of our architecture
is the integration of a Generalized Additive Model, which allows the flexible
and interpretable learning of context-aware edit costs. Experimental results
show that the proposed method achieves similar results as state-of-the-art
reference methods, yet significantly improves both adaptability and
interpretability. That is, the learned cost function offers insights into
complex graph structures, making it particularly valuable in domains such as
molecular analysis and structural pattern discovery.

TL;DR: RegMean++改进RegMean，通过显式考虑层内和跨层依赖关系，提升模型合并性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RegMean独立合并线性层，忽略层间信息传播对最终预测的影响。

Method: 引入RegMean++，显式结合层内和跨层依赖关系，优化合并模型行为。

Result: RegMean++在多种场景下优于RegMean，并达到先进水平。

Conclusion: RegMean++是一种简单有效的模型合并方法，性能优越。

Abstract: Regression Mean (RegMean), an approach that formulates model merging as a
linear regression problem, aims to find the optimal weights for each linear
layer in the merge model by minimizing the discrepancy in predictions between
the merge and candidate models. RegMean provides a precise closed-form solution
for the merging problem; therefore, it offers explainability and computational
efficiency. However, RegMean merges each linear layer independently,
overlooking how the features and information in the earlier layers propagate
through the layers and influence the final prediction in the merge model. In
this paper, we introduce RegMean++, a simple yet effective alternative to
RegMean, that explicitly incorporates both intra- and cross-layer dependencies
between merge models' layers into RegMean's objective. By accounting for these
dependencies, RegMean++ better captures the behaviors of the merge model.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that RegMean++ consistently outperforms
RegMean across diverse settings, including in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain
(OOD) generalization, sequential merging, large-scale tasks, and robustness
under several types of distribution shifts. Furthermore, RegMean++ achieves
competitive or state-of-the-art performance compared to various recent advanced
model merging methods. Our code is available at

Result: Frontier提高了模拟精度，支持未来LLM推理的设计与优化。

Conclusion: Frontier为大规模LLM推理提供了高效、精确的模拟工具。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference is growing increasingly complex with the
rise of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models and disaggregated architectures that
decouple components like prefill/decode (PD) or attention/FFN (AF) for
heterogeneous scaling. Existing simulators, architected for co-located, dense
models, are unable to capture the intricate system dynamics of these emerging
paradigms. We present Frontier, a high-fidelity simulator designed from the
ground up for this new landscape. Frontier introduces a unified framework to
model both co-located and disaggregated systems, providing native support for
MoE inference with expert parallelism (EP). It enables the simulation of
complex workflows like cross-cluster expert routing and advanced pipelining
strategies for latency hiding. To ensure fidelity and usability, Frontier
incorporates refined operator models for improved accuracy. Frontier empowers
the community to design and optimize the future of LLM inference at scale.

Motivation: 评估开源模型GPT-OSS在生物和网络安全领域的潜在风险，为未来开源模型的风险评估提供参考。

Method: 采用恶意微调（MFT）方法，分别在生物威胁创建和网络安全（CTF挑战）任务中训练GPT-OSS，并与闭源和开源模型进行对比。

Result: MFT微调的GPT-OSS在生物和网络安全领域的能力低于前沿闭源模型（如OpenAI o3），对开源模型的提升有限。

Conclusion: 研究支持了GPT-OSS的发布决策，MFT方法可为未来开源模型的风险评估提供指导。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the worst-case frontier risks of releasing gpt-oss.
We introduce malicious fine-tuning (MFT), where we attempt to elicit maximum
capabilities by fine-tuning gpt-oss to be as capable as possible in two
domains: biology and cybersecurity. To maximize biological risk (biorisk), we
curate tasks related to threat creation and train gpt-oss in an RL environment
with web browsing. To maximize cybersecurity risk, we train gpt-oss in an
agentic coding environment to solve capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges. We
compare these MFT models against open- and closed-weight LLMs on frontier risk
evaluations. Compared to frontier closed-weight models, MFT gpt-oss
underperforms OpenAI o3, a model that is below Preparedness High capability
level for biorisk and cybersecurity. Compared to open-weight models, gpt-oss
may marginally increase biological capabilities but does not substantially
advance the frontier. Taken together, these results contributed to our decision
to release the model, and we hope that our MFT approach can serve as useful
guidance for estimating harm from future open-weight releases.

Motivation: 解决现有房价估值方法中黑盒模型缺乏可解释性和简单模型无法捕捉市场异质性的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段聚类，先基于位置特征分组，再为每个聚类分别建模（LR或GAM）。

Result: 在43,309条德国房产数据上，GAM和LR的绝对平均误差分别降低了36%和58%。

Conclusion: 聚类特定分析增强了可解释性，为市场参与者提供了更可靠的估值工具。

Abstract: House price valuation remains challenging due to localized market variations.
Existing approaches often rely on black-box machine learning models, which lack
interpretability, or simplistic methods like linear regression (LR), which fail
to capture market heterogeneity. To address this, we propose a machine learning
approach that applies two-stage clustering, first grouping properties based on
minimal location-based features before incorporating additional features. Each
cluster is then modeled using either LR or a generalized additive model (GAM),
balancing predictive performance with interpretability. Constructing and
evaluating our models on 43,309 German house property listings from 2023, we
achieve a 36% improvement for the GAM and 58% for LR in mean absolute error
compared to models without clustering. Additionally, graphical analyses unveil
pattern shifts between clusters. These findings emphasize the importance of
cluster-specific insights, enhancing interpretability and offering practical
value for buyers, sellers, and real estate analysts seeking more reliable

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前选择性状态空间模型（如Mamba）依赖启发式设计，缺乏理论依据，可能影响其最优性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出预测充分性原则，并基于此设计MPS-SSM模型，通过优化目标函数实现选择性机制。

Result: MPS-SSM在多个基准数据集上表现优异，尤其在长时预测和噪声场景中显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: MPS-SSM不仅性能优越，其预测充分性原则还可推广为通用正则化框架，具有广泛潜力。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), particularly recent selective variants like Mamba,
have emerged as a leading architecture for sequence modeling, challenging the
dominance of Transformers. However, the success of these state-of-the-art
models largely relies on heuristically designed selective mechanisms, which
lack a rigorous first-principle derivation. This theoretical gap raises
questions about their optimality and robustness against spurious correlations.
To address this, we introduce the Principle of Predictive Sufficiency, a novel
information-theoretic criterion stipulating that an ideal hidden state should
be a minimal sufficient statistic of the past for predicting the future. Based
on this principle, we propose the Minimal Predictive Sufficiency State Space
Model (MPS-SSM), a new framework where the selective mechanism is guided by
optimizing an objective function derived from our principle. This approach
encourages the model to maximally compress historical information without
losing predictive power, thereby learning to ignore non-causal noise and
spurious patterns. Extensive experiments on a wide range of benchmark datasets
demonstrate that MPS-SSM not only achieves state-of-the-art performance,
significantly outperforming existing models in long-term forecasting and noisy
scenarios, but also exhibits superior robustness. Furthermore, we show that the
MPS principle can be extended as a general regularization framework to enhance
other popular architectures, highlighting its broad potential.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药物毒性是药物开发中的主要挑战，现有机器学习模型依赖标注数据且缺乏可解释性，难以捕捉器官特异性毒性。

Method: CoTox结合化学结构数据、生物通路和GO术语，利用GPT-4o进行逐步推理，生成可解释的毒性预测。

Result: CoTox在毒性预测上优于传统机器学习和深度学习模型，且使用IUPAC名称表示化学结构能进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: CoTox展示了基于LLM的框架在提高可解释性和支持早期药物安全性评估方面的潜力。

Abstract: Drug toxicity remains a major challenge in pharmaceutical development. Recent
machine learning models have improved in silico toxicity prediction, but their
reliance on annotated data and lack of interpretability limit their
applicability. This limits their ability to capture organ-specific toxicities
driven by complex biological mechanisms. Large language models (LLMs) offer a
promising alternative through step-by-step reasoning and integration of textual
data, yet prior approaches lack biological context and transparent rationale.
To address this issue, we propose CoTox, a novel framework that integrates LLM
with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for multi-toxicity prediction. CoTox
combines chemical structure data, biological pathways, and gene ontology (GO)
terms to generate interpretable toxicity predictions through step-by-step
reasoning. Using GPT-4o, we show that CoTox outperforms both traditional
machine learning and deep learning model. We further examine its performance
across various LLMs to identify where CoTox is most effective. Additionally, we
find that representing chemical structures with IUPAC names, which are easier
for LLMs to understand than SMILES, enhances the model's reasoning ability and
improves predictive performance. To demonstrate its practical utility in drug
development, we simulate the treatment of relevant cell types with drug and
incorporated the resulting biological context into the CoTox framework. This
approach allow CoTox to generate toxicity predictions aligned with
physiological responses, as shown in case study. This result highlights the
potential of LLM-based frameworks to improve interpretability and support
early-stage drug safety assessment. The code and prompt used in this work are

TL;DR: 研究发现，允许用户调整机器学习模型的预测可以减少对不完美算法决策的抵触。然而，这些结果是在用户不了解模型推理的情况下得出的。本文通过引入可解释的ML模型，研究了透明度和可调整性对减少算法抵触的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索可解释的ML模型是否能够进一步减少算法抵触，甚至取代可调整性。

Method: 通过预注册的用户研究（280名参与者），比较透明度和可调整性对算法抵触的影响。

Result: 可调整性显著减少算法抵触，但透明度的效果较小且不显著。透明度和可调整性的影响相对独立。

Conclusion: 可调整性仍是减少算法抵触的有效方法，透明度的作用有限且独立于可调整性。

Abstract: Previous work has shown that allowing users to adjust a machine learning (ML)
model's predictions can reduce aversion to imperfect algorithmic decisions.
However, these results were obtained in situations where users had no
information about the model's reasoning. Thus, it remains unclear whether
interpretable ML models could further reduce algorithm aversion or even render
adjustability obsolete. In this paper, we conceptually replicate a well-known
study that examines the effect of adjustable predictions on algorithm aversion
and extend it by introducing an interpretable ML model that visually reveals
its decision logic. Through a pre-registered user study with 280 participants,
we investigate how transparency interacts with adjustability in reducing
aversion to algorithmic decision-making. Our results replicate the
adjustability effect, showing that allowing users to modify algorithmic
predictions mitigates aversion. Transparency's impact appears smaller than
expected and was not significant for our sample. Furthermore, the effects of
transparency and adjustability appear to be more independent than expected.

Conclusion: 该架构为物理信息且具备推理能力的机器学习提供了新方向。

Abstract: We propose a novel machine learning architecture that departs from
conventional neural network paradigms by leveraging quantum spectral methods,
specifically Pade approximants and the Lanczos algorithm, for interpretable
signal analysis and symbolic reasoning. The core innovation of our approach
lies in its ability to transform raw time-domain signals into sparse,
physically meaningful spectral representations without the use of
backpropagation, high-dimensional embeddings, or data-intensive black-box
models. Through rational spectral approximation, the system extracts resonant
structures that are then mapped into symbolic predicates via a kernel
projection function, enabling logical inference through a rule-based reasoning
engine. This architecture bridges mathematical physics, sparse approximation
theory, and symbolic artificial intelligence, offering a transparent and
physically grounded alternative to deep learning models. We develop the full
mathematical formalism underlying each stage of the pipeline, provide a modular
algorithmic implementation, and demonstrate the system's effectiveness through
comparative evaluations on time-series anomaly detection, symbolic
classification, and hybrid reasoning tasks. Our results show that this
spectral-symbolic architecture achieves competitive accuracy while maintaining
interpretability and data efficiency, suggesting a promising new direction for
physically-informed, reasoning-capable machine learning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AS-Softmax的改进方法，解决了传统softmax在分类任务中的过拟合和训练效率低的问题，通过自适应稀疏化和梯度累积策略提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统softmax在分类任务中存在目标分数无法达到1的问题，导致训练持续且易过拟合，同时浪费资源处理已正确分类的样本。

Method: 提出AS-Softmax，通过稀疏化处理丢弃低分样本，专注于强对抗样本，并采用自适应梯度累积策略加速训练。

Result: AS-Softmax在多种分类任务中表现优于传统softmax，且训练速度提升1.2倍。

Conclusion: AS-Softmax有效解决了softmax的缺陷，提升了分类性能和训练效率。

Abstract: Softmax with the cross entropy loss is the standard configuration for current
neural classification models. The gold score for a target class is supposed to
be 1, but it is never reachable under the softmax schema. Such a problem makes
the training process continue forever and leads to overfitting. Moreover, the
"target-approach-1" training goal forces the model to continuously learn all
samples, leading to a waste of time in handling some samples which have already
been classified correctly with high confidence, while the test goal simply
requires the target class of each sample to hold the maximum score. To solve
the above weaknesses, we propose the Adaptive Sparse softmax (AS-Softmax) which
designs a reasonable and test-matching transformation on top of softmax. For
more purposeful learning, we discard the classes with far smaller scores
compared with the actual class during training. Then the model could focus on
learning to distinguish the target class from its strong opponents, which is
also the great challenge in test. In addition, since the training losses of
easy samples will gradually drop to 0 in AS-Softmax, we develop an adaptive
gradient accumulation strategy based on the masked sample ratio to speed up
training. We verify the proposed AS-Softmax on a variety of text multi-class,
text multi-label, text token classification, image classification and audio
classification tasks with class sizes ranging from 5 to 5000+. The results show
that AS-Softmax consistently outperforms softmax and its variants, and the loss
of AS-Softmax is remarkably correlated with classification performance in
validation. Furthermore, adaptive gradient accumulation strategy can bring
about 1.2x training speedup comparing with the standard softmax while
maintaining classification effectiveness.

Abstract: In recent years, the expansion of neural network models and training data has
driven remarkable progress in deep learning, particularly in computer vision
and natural language processing. This advancement is underpinned by the concept
of Scaling Laws, which demonstrates that scaling model parameters and training
data enhances learning performance. While these fields have witnessed
breakthroughs, such as the development of large language models like GPT-4 and
advanced vision models like Midjourney, the application of scaling laws in deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) remains relatively unexplored. Despite its
potential to improve performance, the integration of scaling laws into DRL for
decision making has not been fully realized. This review addresses this gap by
systematically analyzing scaling strategies in three dimensions: data, network,
and training budget. In data scaling, we explore methods to optimize data
efficiency through parallel sampling and data generation, examining the
relationship between data volume and learning outcomes. For network scaling, we
investigate architectural enhancements, including monolithic expansions,
ensemble and MoE methods, and agent number scaling techniques, which
collectively enhance model expressivity while posing unique computational
challenges. Lastly, in training budget scaling, we evaluate the impact of
distributed training, high replay ratios, large batch sizes, and auxiliary
training on training efficiency and convergence. By synthesizing these
strategies, this review not only highlights their synergistic roles in
advancing DRL for decision making but also provides a roadmap for future
research. We emphasize the importance of balancing scalability with
computational efficiency and outline promising directions for leveraging
scaling to unlock the full potential of DRL in various tasks such as robot
control, autonomous driving and LLM training.

Result: 首次为Heun采样器推导了Wasserstein收敛界，并改进了Euler采样器的现有结果。

Conclusion: 空间规律性和分数误差控制对收敛性至关重要，平滑Wasserstein距离有助于优化初始化误差界限。

Abstract: We provide new convergence guarantees in Wasserstein distance for
diffusion-based generative models, covering both stochastic (DDPM-like) and
deterministic (DDIM-like) sampling methods. We introduce a simple framework to
analyze discretization, initialization, and score estimation errors. Notably,
we derive the first Wasserstein convergence bound for the Heun sampler and
improve existing results for the Euler sampler of the probability flow ODE. Our
analysis emphasizes the importance of spatial regularity of the learned score
function and argues for controlling the score error with respect to the true
reverse process, in line with denoising score matching. We also incorporate
recent results on smoothed Wasserstein distances to sharpen initialization
error bounds.

Abstract: Information propagation characterizes how input correlations evolve across
layers in deep neural networks. This framework has been well studied using
mean-field theory, which assumes infinitely wide networks. However, these
assumptions break down for practical, finite-size networks. In this work, we
study information propagation in randomly initialized neural networks with
finite width and reveal that the boundary between ordered and chaotic regimes
exhibits a fractal structure. This shows the fundamental complexity of neural
network dynamics, in a setting that is independent of input data and
optimization. To extend this analysis beyond multilayer perceptrons, we
leverage recently introduced Fourier-based structured transforms, and show that
information propagation in convolutional neural networks also follow the same
behavior. Our investigation highlights the importance of finite network depth
with respect to the tradeoff between separation and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MU方法缺乏统计保证且计算成本高，需改进。

Method: 基于Conformal Prediction定义MU，提出ECF和EuCF指标，并设计优化方法。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效移除目标数据。

Conclusion: 新方法为MU提供了统计保证和高效实现。

Abstract: The increasing demand for data privacy, driven by regulations such as GDPR
and CCPA, has made Machine Unlearning (MU) essential for removing the influence
of specific training samples from machine learning models while preserving
performance on retained data. However, most existing MU methods lack rigorous
statistical guarantees, rely on heuristic metrics, and often require
computationally expensive retraining baselines. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce a new definition for MU based on Conformal Prediction (CP),
providing statistically sound, uncertainty-aware guarantees without the need
for the concept of naive retraining. We formalize conformal criteria that
quantify how often forgotten samples are excluded from CP sets, and propose
empirical metrics,the Efficiently Covered Frequency (ECF at c) and its
complement, the Efficiently Uncovered Frequency (EuCF at d), to measure the
effectiveness of unlearning. We further present a practical unlearning method
designed to optimize these conformal metrics. Extensive experiments across
diverse forgetting scenarios, datasets and models demonstrate the efficacy of
our approach in removing targeted data.

Motivation: 数字广告平台中的实时竞价系统面临广告商异质性带来的复杂挑战，传统自动竞价方法在样本效率和约束转移泛化能力上表现不佳。

Method: HALO采用后见机制重新利用探索数据，并通过B样条函数表示实现跨约束空间的连续、导数感知的竞价映射。

Result: 在工业数据集上的评估表明，HALO在多尺度约束处理上表现优越，减少了约束违规并提高了总交易额（GMV）。

Conclusion: HALO为多约束竞价问题提供了一种高效且适应性强的解决方案，适用于广告商预算和ROI目标差异巨大的场景。

Abstract: Digital advertising platforms operate millisecond-level auctions through
Real-Time Bidding (RTB) systems, where advertisers compete for ad impressions
through algorithmic bids. This dynamic mechanism enables precise audience
targeting but introduces profound operational complexity due to advertiser
heterogeneity: budgets and ROI targets span orders of magnitude across
advertisers, from individual merchants to multinational brands. This diversity
creates a demanding adaptation landscape for Multi-Constraint Bidding (MCB).
Traditional auto-bidding solutions fail in this environment due to two critical
flaws: 1) severe sample inefficiency, where failed explorations under specific
constraints yield no transferable knowledge for new budget-ROI combinations,
and 2) limited generalization under constraint shifts, as they ignore physical
relationships between constraints and bidding coefficients. To address this, we
propose HALO: Hindsight-Augmented Learning for Online Auto-Bidding. HALO
introduces a theoretically grounded hindsight mechanism that repurposes all
explorations into training data for arbitrary constraint configuration via
trajectory reorientation. Further, it employs B-spline functional
representation, enabling continuous, derivative-aware bid mapping across
constraint spaces. HALO ensures robust adaptation even when budget/ROI
requirements differ drastically from training scenarios. Industrial dataset
evaluations demonstrate the superiority of HALO in handling multi-scale
constraints, reducing constraint violations while improving GMV.

Result: 初步结果显示竞争性性能，并提供高质量的逻辑解释。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了基于人类可理解的时间模式的分类，并生成局部和全局的符号解释。

Abstract: Time series classification is a task of paramount importance, as this kind of
data often arises in safety-critical applications. However, it is typically
tackled with black-box deep learning methods, making it hard for humans to
understand the rationale behind their output. To take on this challenge, we
propose a neuro-symbolic framework that unifies classification and explanation
through direct embedding of trajectories into a space of Signal Temporal Logic
(STL) concepts. By introducing a novel STL-inspired kernel that maps raw time
series to their alignment with predefined STL formulae, our model jointly
optimises for accuracy and interpretability, as each prediction is accompanied
by the most relevant logical concepts that characterise it. This enables
classification grounded in human-interpretable temporal patterns and produces
both local and global symbolic explanations. Early results show competitive
performance while offering high-quality logical justifications for model
decisions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复数数据在信号处理中广泛存在，但现有散度框架未能完全适应复数数据的需求。

Method: 扩展alpha-beta散度定义至复数向量，并通过设置超参数使其涵盖经典距离（如欧氏距离和马氏距离）。

Result: 得到了复数随机向量近似问题的闭式解，揭示了超参数的不同作用。

Conclusion: 该扩展为复数数据提供了灵活的散度框架，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Divergences are fundamental to the information criteria that underpin most
signal processing algorithms. The alpha-beta family of divergences, designed
for non-negative data, offers a versatile framework that parameterizes and
continuously interpolates several separable divergences found in existing
literature. This work extends the definition of alpha-beta divergences to
accommodate complex data, specifically when the arguments of the divergence are
complex vectors. This novel formulation is designed in such a way that, by
setting the divergence hyperparameters to unity, it particularizes to the
well-known Euclidean and Mahalanobis squared distances. Other choices of
hyperparameters yield practical separable and non-separable extensions of
several classical divergences. In the context of the problem of approximating a
complex random vector, the centroid obtained by optimizing the alpha-beta mean
distortion has a closed-form expression, which interpretation sheds light on
the distinct roles of the divergence hyperparameters. These contributions may
have wide potential applicability, as there are many signal processing domains
in which the underlying data are inherently complex.

TL;DR: 研究通过将超关系知识图（HKG）分解为传统知识图（KG）格式，评估经典知识图嵌入（KGE）模型在HKG上的表现，发现部分KGE模型性能接近超关系KGE（HKGE）模型。进一步分析发现分解方法未能完全保留HKG信息，且当前HKGE模型存在长程依赖或信息压缩问题。提出的FormerGNN框架通过保留HKG拓扑和优化信息整合，表现优于现有HKGE模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨超关系知识图嵌入模型的优越性能是否源于其基础KGE模型或专门设计的扩展模块。

Method: 将HKG数据分解为KG格式，评估经典KGE模型表现；提出FormerGNN框架，结合GNN编码器和优化信息整合方法。

Result: 部分KGE模型性能接近HKGE模型；分解方法改变HKG拓扑且信息保留不全；FormerGNN表现优于现有HKGE模型。

Conclusion: 分解方法影响HKG信息完整性，当前HKGE模型存在局限性；FormerGNN为未来研究提供了潜在方向。

Abstract: Recently, Hyper-relational Knowledge Graphs (HKGs) have been proposed as an
extension of traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to better represent real-world
facts with additional qualifiers. As a result, researchers have attempted to
adapt classical Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models for HKGs by designing
extra qualifier processing modules. However, it remains unclear whether the
superior performance of Hyper-relational KGE (HKGE) models arises from their
base KGE model or the specially designed extension module. Hence, in this
paper, we data-wise convert HKGs to KG format using three decomposition methods
and then evaluate the performance of several classical KGE models on HKGs. Our
results show that some KGE models achieve performance comparable to that of
HKGE models. Upon further analysis, we find that the decomposition methods
alter the original HKG topology and fail to fully preserve HKG information.
Moreover, we observe that current HKGE models are either insufficient in
capturing the graph's long-range dependency or struggle to integrate
main-triple and qualifier information due to the information compression issue.
To further justify our findings and offer a potential direction for future HKGE
research, we propose the FormerGNN framework. This framework employs a
qualifier integrator to preserve the original HKG topology, and a GNN-based
graph encoder to capture the graph's long-range dependencies, followed by an
improved approach for integrating main-triple and qualifier information to
mitigate compression issues. Our experimental results demonstrate that
FormerGNN outperforms existing HKGE models.

Motivation: 现实世界中的图随时间演变，需要及时和在线预测，但现有方法未明确定义图上的在线持续学习。

Method: 提出了一种通用的在线持续学习在图上的框架，并引入了一组基准测试。

Result: 报告了多种持续学习方法在适应新设置后的性能表现。

Conclusion: 该工作为图上的在线持续学习提供了明确的定义和评估标准。

Abstract: The aim of Continual Learning (CL) is to learn new tasks incrementally while
avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Online Continual Learning (OCL) specifically
focuses on learning efficiently from a continuous stream of data with shifting
distribution. While recent studies explore Continual Learning on graphs
exploiting Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), only few of them focus on a streaming
setting. Yet, many real-world graphs evolve over time, often requiring timely
and online predictions. Current approaches, however, are not well aligned with
the standard OCL setting, partly due to the lack of a clear definition of
online Continual Learning on graphs. In this work, we propose a general
formulation for online Continual Learning on graphs, emphasizing the efficiency
requirements on batch processing over the graph topology, and providing a
well-defined setting for systematic model evaluation. Finally, we introduce a
set of benchmarks and report the performance of several methods in the CL
literature, adapted to our setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在假设检验中，代理人基于私人信念的策略行为如何影响委托人的决策，以平衡假阳性和假阴性错误。

Method: 构建博弈论模型，分析代理人的参与和报告行为对统计决策规则的影响，并通过公开药物审批数据验证模型。

Result: 发现委托人的错误在临界p值阈值下呈现单调性，从而提供最优p值阈值的可解释性特征。

Conclusion: 研究为假设检验框架下的策略互动提供了全面视角，具有技术和监管意义。

Abstract: We examine hypothesis testing within a principal-agent framework, where a
strategic agent, holding private beliefs about the effectiveness of a product,
submits data to a principal who decides on approval. The principal employs a
hypothesis testing rule, aiming to pick a p-value threshold that balances false
positives and false negatives while anticipating the agent's incentive to
maximize expected profitability. Building on prior work, we develop a
game-theoretic model that captures how the agent's participation and reporting
behavior respond to the principal's statistical decision rule. Despite the
complexity of the interaction, we show that the principal's errors exhibit
clear monotonic behavior when segmented by an efficiently computable critical
p-value threshold, leading to an interpretable characterization of their
optimal p-value threshold. We empirically validate our model and these insights
using publicly available data on drug approvals. Overall, our work offers a
comprehensive perspective on strategic interactions within the hypothesis
testing framework, providing technical and regulatory insights.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理信息的神经算子（PINO）框架，用于从稀疏测量数据中重建非线性海洋波场，无需训练时的真实数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实时预测相位分辨海洋波场的难题，因缺乏从稀疏或间接测量中重建初始条件的实用方法。

Result: 验证表明，PINO能准确重建非线性波场，适用于浮标时间序列和雷达快照。

Conclusion: PINO为实际海洋环境中的数据驱动波场重建和预测提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Accurate real-time prediction of phase-resolved ocean wave fields remains a
critical yet largely unsolved problem, primarily due to the absence of
practical data assimilation methods for reconstructing initial conditions from
sparse or indirect wave measurements. While recent advances in supervised deep
learning have shown potential for this purpose, they require large labelled
datasets of ground truth wave data, which are infeasible to obtain in
real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) framework for reconstructing spatially
and temporally phase-resolved, nonlinear ocean wave fields from sparse
measurements, without the need for ground truth data during training. This is
achieved by embedding residuals of the free surface boundary conditions of
ocean gravity waves into the loss function of the PINO, constraining the
solution space in a soft manner. After training, we validate our approach using
highly realistic synthetic wave data and demonstrate the accurate
reconstruction of nonlinear wave fields from both buoy time series and radar
snapshots. Our results indicate that PINOs enable accurate, real-time
reconstruction and generalize robustly across a wide range of wave conditions,
thereby paving the way for operational, data-driven wave reconstruction and
prediction in realistic marine environments.

Motivation: 探讨表格数据任务中偏见缓解方法是否也存在“拉平效应”，并探索避免零和博弈的替代方案。

Method: 评估了八种偏见缓解方法，包括常用和前沿方法，在44个任务中使用五个真实数据集和四种常见ML模型。

Result: 发现方法呈现零和博弈特性，但通过仅对弱势群体应用最新方法，可能避免负面影响。

Conclusion: 研究为在不牺牲其他群体或整体性能的情况下提升公平性提供了潜在路径。

Abstract: Fairness is a critical requirement for Machine Learning (ML) software,
driving the development of numerous bias mitigation methods. Previous research
has identified a leveling-down effect in bias mitigation for computer vision
and natural language processing tasks, where fairness is achieved by lowering
performance for all groups without benefiting the unprivileged group. However,
it remains unclear whether this effect applies to bias mitigation for tabular
data tasks, a key area in fairness research with significant real-world
applications. This study evaluates eight bias mitigation methods for tabular
data, including both widely used and cutting-edge approaches, across 44 tasks
using five real-world datasets and four common ML models. Contrary to earlier
findings, our results show that these methods operate in a zero-sum fashion,
where improvements for unprivileged groups are related to reduced benefits for
traditionally privileged groups. However, previous research indicates that the
perception of a zero-sum trade-off might complicate the broader adoption of
fairness policies. To explore alternatives, we investigate an approach that
applies the state-of-the-art bias mitigation method solely to unprivileged
groups, showing potential to enhance benefits of unprivileged groups without
negatively affecting privileged groups or overall ML performance. Our study
highlights potential pathways for achieving fairness improvements without
zero-sum trade-offs, which could help advance the adoption of bias mitigation
methods.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在低比特量化下精度严重下降的问题，优化内存和能源效率。

Method: 引入三种层间诊断指标（困惑度下降、表示紧凑性和Top-k能量增益），自动分配比特宽度，无需梯度更新。

Result: 在2.05比特量化下恢复Qwen3-4B模型95.9%的FP16性能，优于GPTQ和AWQ；在LLaMA3.2-3B上保持98.2%的基线精度，实现4倍内存减少。

Conclusion: LieQ为资源受限的边缘设备部署小型语言模型提供了新范式。

Abstract: Large language models with billions of parameters are often over-provisioned:
many layers contribute little unique information yet dominate the memory and
energy footprint during inference. We present LieQ, a metric-driven
post-training quantization framework that addresses the critical challenge of
maintaining accuracy in sub-7B models under extreme low-bit compression. Our
method introduces three complementary layer-wise diagnostics-Perplexity Drop,
Representational Compactness, and Top-k Energy Gain -that reveal a canonical
division of labour across layers, enabling automatic bit-width allocation
without gradient updates. Unlike existing approaches that suffer severe
accuracy degradation at 2-3 bits precision, LieQ achieves state-of-the-art
compression-accuracy trade-offs: on Qwen3-4B, it recovers 95.9% of FP16
baseline performance at 2.05-bit quantization, outperforming GPTQ by 19.7% and
AWQ by 18.1% on average across seven zero-shot reasoning tasks. Applied to
LLaMA3.2-3B, LieQ maintains 98.2% of baseline accuracy at 2.07-bit precision
while enabling 4x memory reduction, establishing new paradigms for deploying
small language models on resource-constrained edge devices.

Result: 在SWE-bench Verified基准上，成功率从20%提升至39%，并在SWE-rebench上优于其他领先模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于开源模型构建更强大的自主代理提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Research on applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to Large Language
Models (LLMs) has mostly been focused on single-turn problems, such as
mathematical reasoning or single-shot code generation. While these problems can
be viewed as token-level multi-turn MDPs, this view corresponds to a degenerate
case of multi-turn interaction where the environment provides no feedback. This
contrasts with many real-world domains, such as software engineering (SWE),
which require rich multi-turn interactions with a stateful environment that
responds to each action with a non-trivial observation.
  To bridge this gap, we demonstrate the successful application of RL to this
general regime. Using a modified Decoupled Advantage Policy Optimization (DAPO)
algorithm, we train an agent based on Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to solve real-world
software engineering tasks. Our approach increases the agent's success rate on
the SWE-bench Verified benchmark from a 20% rejection fine-tuned baseline to
39%, without relying on any teacher models. On SWE-rebench, our agent matches
or outperforms leading open-weight models such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and
Qwen3-235B-A22B using an identical scaffolding, offering a viable path toward
building more capable autonomous agents for complex real-world problems based
on open models.

Conclusion: 该模型为氢陷阱参数提取提供了高效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: The hydrogen trapping behaviour of metallic alloys is generally characterised
using Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy (TDS). However, as an indirect method,
extracting key parameters (trap binding energies and densities) remains a
significant challenge. To address these limitations, this work introduces a
machine learning-based scheme for parameter identification from TDS spectra. A
multi-Neural Network (NN) model is developed and trained exclusively on
synthetic data to predict trapping parameters directly from experimental data.
The model comprises two multi-layer, fully connected, feed-forward NNs trained
with backpropagation. The first network (classification model) predicts the
number of distinct trap types. The second network (regression model) then
predicts the corresponding trap densities and binding energies. The NN
architectures, hyperparameters, and data pre-processing were optimised to
minimise the amount of training data. The proposed model demonstrated strong
predictive capabilities when applied to three tempered martensitic steels of
different compositions. The code developed is freely provided.

Motivation: 解决低秩适配器因秩约束导致的表达能力不足问题，同时保持参数高效性。

Method: 提出MoKA，利用Kronecker乘积混合和门控机制，实现更灵活的秩选择和硬件高效计算。

Result: 在指令微调和常识推理任务中，MoKA优于基线方法，参数减少27倍，性能与参数效率达到最佳平衡。

Conclusion: MoKA在保持参数高效的同时显著提升了模型性能，适用于复杂任务。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is essential for reducing the
computational overhead of large language models (LLMs). Low-rank family
adapters are commonly used to control the parameter size efficiently while
maintaining the generative power of LLMs. However, their limited expressiveness
due to the rank constraint often restricts their performance on complex tasks.
We propose Mixture of Kronecker Adapters (MoKA), a new generation of Kronecker
adapters that addresses this limitation by modeling weight updates as a mixture
of Kronecker products. Our proposed adapter leverages a gating mechanism that
measures the importance of each Kronecker factor, enabling more expressive
adaptation. Moreover, MoKA enables a rank flexibility that provides a better
trade-off between parameter efficiency and accuracy. To ensure hardware
efficiency, we reformulate Kronecker computations using standard matrix
operations, allowing seamless deployment on GPU-optimized hardware. We conduct
extensive experiments on instruction-tuning and commonsense reasoning tasks
using low-bit quantized versions of LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA3-8B models. MoKA not
only outperforms PEFT baselines, but also reduces the number of trainable
parameters up to 27x, achieving state-of-the-art trade-offs between performance
and parameter efficiency.

Result: 在12种先进异常检测方法中表现最优，F1分数提升约22%，适用于医疗设备和消费级可穿戴设备。

Conclusion: 系统成功部署于家庭环境，证明无需临床级设备即可实现高质量健康监测，并通过LLM增强结果的可解释性。

Abstract: We introduce AI on the Pulse, a real-world-ready anomaly detection system
that continuously monitors patients using a fusion of wearable sensors, ambient
intelligence, and advanced AI models. Powered by UniTS, a state-of-the-art
(SoTA) universal time-series model, our framework autonomously learns each
patient's unique physiological and behavioral patterns, detecting subtle
deviations that signal potential health risks. Unlike classification methods
that require impractical, continuous labeling in real-world scenarios, our
approach uses anomaly detection to provide real-time, personalized alerts for
reactive home-care interventions. Our approach outperforms 12 SoTA anomaly
detection methods, demonstrating robustness across both high-fidelity medical
devices (ECG) and consumer wearables, with a ~ 22% improvement in F1 score.
However, the true impact of AI on the Pulse lies in @HOME, where it has been
successfully deployed for continuous, real-world patient monitoring. By
operating with non-invasive, lightweight devices like smartwatches, our system
proves that high-quality health monitoring is possible without clinical-grade
equipment. Beyond detection, we enhance interpretability by integrating LLMs,
translating anomaly scores into clinically meaningful insights for healthcare
professionals.

Abstract: Drug discovery frequently loses momentum when data, expertise, and tools are
scattered, slowing design cycles. To shorten this loop we built a hierarchical,
tool using agent framework that automates molecular optimisation. A Principal
Researcher defines each objective, a Database agent retrieves target
information, an AI Expert generates de novo scaffolds with a sequence to
molecule deep learning model, a Medicinal Chemist edits them while invoking a
docking tool, a Ranking agent scores the candidates, and a Scientific Critic
polices the logic. Each tool call is summarised and stored causing the full
reasoning path to remain inspectable. The agents communicate through concise
provenance records that capture molecular lineage, to build auditable, molecule
centered reasoning trajectories and reuse successful transformations via in
context learning. Three cycle research loops were run against AKT1 protein
using five large language models. After ranking the models by mean docking
score, we ran 20 independent scale ups on the two top performers. We then
compared the leading LLMs' binding affinity results across three
configurations, LLM only, single agent, and multi agent. Our results reveal an
architectural trade off, the multi agent setting excelled at focused binding
optimization, improving average predicted binding affinity by 31%. In contrast,
single agent runs generated molecules with superior drug like properties at the
cost of less potent binding scores. Unguided LLM runs finished fastest, yet
their lack of transparent tool signals left the validity of their reasoning
paths unverified. These results show that test time scaling, focused feedback
loops and provenance convert general purpose LLMs into auditable systems for
molecular design, and suggest that extending the toolset to ADMET and
selectivity predictors could push research workflows further along the
discovery pipeline.

Motivation: 机器学习评估中的人类标注数据常因预算限制而忽略标注者间的分歧，这影响了结果的可靠性。

Method: 分析了多个分类数据集和模拟分布，确定了在固定预算（N×K）下最优的（N, K）配置。

Conclusion: 研究为机器学习实践者提供了优化评估数据收集的方法，以在预算内获得更高的可靠性。

Abstract: Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific validation and of the
authority it confers on its results. Reproducibility in machine learning
evaluations leads to greater trust, confidence, and value. However, the ground
truth responses used in machine learning often necessarily come from humans,
among whom disagreement is prevalent, and surprisingly little research has
studied the impact of effectively ignoring disagreement in these responses, as
is typically the case. One reason for the lack of research is that budgets for
collecting human-annotated evaluation data are limited, and obtaining more
samples from multiple annotators for each example greatly increases the
per-item annotation costs. We investigate the trade-off between the number of
items ($N$) and the number of responses per item ($K$) needed for reliable
machine learning evaluation. We analyze a diverse collection of categorical
datasets for which multiple annotations per item exist, and simulated
distributions fit to these datasets, to determine the optimal $(N, K)$
configuration, given a fixed budget ($N \times K$), for collecting evaluation
data and reliably comparing the performance of machine learning models. Our
findings show, first, that accounting for human disagreement may come with $N
\times K$ at no more than 1000 (and often much lower) for every dataset tested
on at least one metric. Moreover, this minimal $N \times K$ almost always
occurred for $K > 10$. Furthermore, the nature of the tradeoff between $K$ and
$N$ -- or if one even existed -- depends on the evaluation metric, with metrics
that are more sensitive to the full distribution of responses performing better
at higher levels of $K$. Our methods can be used to help ML practitioners get
more effective test data by finding the optimal metrics and number of items and
annotations per item to collect to get the most reliability for their budget.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态资源分配或单目标优化方法无法同时满足SLA合规性和资源效率的需求，导致资源浪费或SLA违规。

Method: SLA-MORL通过智能初始化和动态权重适应，构建21维状态表示，使用actor-critic网络进行资源分配决策。

Result: 在13种ML工作负载上，SLA-MORL显著减少了训练时间（67.2%）、成本（68.8%）并提高了SLA合规性（73.4%）。

Conclusion: SLA-MORL解决了冷启动和动态适应问题，为现代ML训练环境提供了性能、成本和可靠性的平衡解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic resource allocation for machine learning workloads in cloud
environments remains challenging due to competing objectives of minimizing
training time and operational costs while meeting Service Level Agreement (SLA)
constraints. Traditional approaches employ static resource allocation or
single-objective optimization, leading to either SLA violations or resource
waste. We present SLA-MORL, an adaptive multi-objective reinforcement learning
framework that intelligently allocates GPU and CPU resources based on
user-defined preferences (time, cost, or balanced) while ensuring SLA
compliance. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) intelligent
initialization through historical learning or efficient baseline runs that
eliminates cold-start problems, reducing initial exploration overhead by 60%,
and (2) dynamic weight adaptation that automatically adjusts optimization
priorities based on real-time SLA violation severity, creating a
self-correcting system. SLA-MORL constructs a 21-dimensional state
representation capturing resource utilization, training progress, and SLA
compliance, enabling an actor-critic network to make informed allocation
decisions across 9 possible actions. Extensive evaluation on 13 diverse ML
workloads using production HPC infrastructure demonstrates that SLA-MORL
achieves 67.2% reduction in training time for deadline-critical jobs, 68.8%
reduction in costs for budget-constrained workloads, and 73.4% improvement in
overall SLA compliance compared to static baselines. By addressing both
cold-start inefficiency and dynamic adaptation challenges, SLA-MORL provides a
practical solution for cloud resource management that balances performance,
cost, and reliability in modern ML training environments.

### [312] [VRPRM: Process Reward Modeling via Visual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03556)
*Xinquan Chen,Bangwei Liu,Xuhong Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VRPRM通过视觉推理和两阶段训练策略，以更低的数据标注成本提升过程奖励模型（PRM）的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRM缺乏长期推理和深度思考能力，而引入思维链（CoT）的PRM数据标注成本过高。

Method: 提出VRPRM，结合视觉推理，设计高效的两阶段训练策略。

Result: 仅用3.6K CoT-PRM数据和50K非CoT数据，性能超越400K数据的非思考PRM，相对提升118%。

Conclusion: VRPRM以更低成本实现高质量推理，为PRM训练提供高效数据利用新范式。

Abstract: Process Reward Model (PRM) is widely used in the post-training of Large
Language Model (LLM) because it can perform fine-grained evaluation of the
reasoning steps of generated content. However, most PRMs lack long-term
reasoning and deep thinking capabilities. On the other hand, although a few
works have tried to introduce Chain-of-Thought capability into PRMs, the
annotation cost of CoT-PRM data is too expensive to play a stable role in
various tasks. To address the above challenges, we propose VRPRM, a process
reward model via visual reasoning, and design an efficient two-stage training
strategy. Experimental results show that using only 3.6K CoT-PRM SFT data and
50K non-CoT PRM RL training data, VRPRM can surpass the non-thinking PRM with a
total data volume of 400K and achieved a relative performance improvement of up
to 118\% over the base model in the BoN experiment. This result confirms that
the proposed combined training strategy can achieve higher quality reasoning
capabilities at a lower data annotation cost, thus providing a new paradigm for
PRM training with more efficient data utilization.

TL;DR: Horus是一个针对联邦学习中异构性和中毒攻击的鲁棒框架，通过低秩适应（LoRA）减少攻击面并提高鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在超异构环境下易受中毒攻击，且高维模型扩大了攻击面，需要一种鲁棒性更强的框架。

Method: Horus在稳定层插入LoRA，仅聚合LoRA以减少攻击面，利用LoRA-A的稳定性设计中毒评分，并通过投影感知聚合机制优化客户端更新。

Result: Horus在多样数据集、模型架构和攻击下，鲁棒性和准确性均优于现有基线。

Conclusion: Horus通过LoRA和投影感知聚合，有效解决了联邦学习中的异构性和中毒攻击问题。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) remains highly vulnerable to poisoning attacks,
especially under real-world hyper-heterogeneity, where clients differ
significantly in data distributions, communication capabilities, and model
architectures. Such heterogeneity not only undermines the effectiveness of
aggregation strategies but also makes attacks more difficult to detect.
Furthermore, high-dimensional models expand the attack surface. To address
these challenges, we propose Horus, a heterogeneity-oblivious robust FL
framework centered on low-rank adaptations (LoRAs). Rather than aggregating
full model parameters, Horus inserts LoRAs into empirically stable layers and
aggregates only LoRAs to reduce the attack surface.We uncover a key empirical
observation that the input projection (LoRA-A) is markedly more stable than the
output projection (LoRA-B) under heterogeneity and poisoning. Leveraging this,
we design a Heterogeneity-Oblivious Poisoning Score using the features from
LoRA-A to filter poisoned clients. For the remaining benign clients, we propose
projection-aware aggregation mechanism to preserve collaborative signals while
suppressing drifts, which reweights client updates by consistency with the
global directions. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, model
architectures, and attacks demonstrate that Horus consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both robustness and accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有XAI方法因缺乏统一的最优解释标准，难以客观评估和优化，DeepFaith旨在通过忠实性视角提供理论上的最优解释。

Method: DeepFaith通过统一多忠实性指标的数学表达，设计学习框架，结合现有解释方法生成高质量监督信号，优化模式一致性和局部相关性训练解释器。

Result: 在12个任务、6个模型和6个数据集上，DeepFaith在10个忠实性指标上表现最优，展示了其有效性和跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: DeepFaith为XAI提供了一种理论支持的统一解释框架，显著提升了解释的忠实性和通用性。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) builds trust in complex systems through model
attribution methods that reveal the decision rationale. However, due to the
absence of a unified optimal explanation, existing XAI methods lack a ground
truth for objective evaluation and optimization. To address this issue, we
propose Deep architecture-based Faith explainer (DeepFaith), a domain-free and
model-agnostic unified explanation framework under the lens of faithfulness. By
establishing a unified formulation for multiple widely used and well-validated
faithfulness metrics, we derive an optimal explanation objective whose solution
simultaneously achieves optimal faithfulness across these metrics, thereby
providing a ground truth from a theoretical perspective. We design an explainer
learning framework that leverages multiple existing explanation methods,
applies deduplicating and filtering to construct high-quality supervised
explanation signals, and optimizes both pattern consistency loss and local
correlation to train a faithful explainer. Once trained, DeepFaith can generate
highly faithful explanations through a single forward pass without accessing
the model being explained. On 12 diverse explanation tasks spanning 6 models
and 6 datasets, DeepFaith achieves the highest overall faithfulness across 10
metrics compared to all baseline methods, highlighting its effectiveness and
cross-domain generalizability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为“Silent Gradients”的新方法，通过特定解码器架构解析计算期望ELBO，避免了梯度估计的方差问题，从而提升生成模型的训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练深度生成模型（如VAE）时，随机采样潜在变量会引入梯度估计方差，影响收敛和性能。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用特定解码器架构解析计算期望ELBO，提出零方差梯度方法，并通过动态训练策略结合解析梯度与随机估计。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个数据集上优于现有基线方法（如重参数化、Gumbel-Softmax和REINFORCE）。

Conclusion: Silent Gradients为生成模型训练提供了新方向，结合了解析计算的稳定性和深度非线性架构的表达能力。

Abstract: Training deep generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) is often
hindered by the need to backpropagate gradients through the stochastic sampling
of their latent variables, a process that inherently introduces estimation
variance, which can slow convergence and degrade performance. In this paper, we
propose a new perspective that sidesteps this problem, which we call Silent
Gradients. Instead of improving stochastic estimators, we leverage specific
decoder architectures to analytically compute the expected ELBO, yielding a
gradient with zero variance. We first provide a theoretical foundation for this
method and demonstrate its superiority over existing estimators in a controlled
setting with a linear decoder. To generalize our approach for practical use
with complex, expressive decoders, we introduce a novel training dynamic that
uses the exact, zero-variance gradient to guide the early stages of encoder
training before annealing to a standard stochastic estimator. Our experiments
show that this technique consistently improves the performance of established
baselines, including reparameterization, Gumbel-Softmax, and REINFORCE, across
multiple datasets. This work opens a new direction for training generative
models by combining the stability of analytical computation with the
expressiveness of deep, nonlinear architecture.

TL;DR: VITA是一种用于作物产量预测的变分预训练框架，通过自监督特征掩码解决数据不对称问题，在极端天气年份表现尤为突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型在产量偏离历史趋势时表现不佳，主要由于预训练天气数据与微调数据之间的不对称性。

Method: VITA利用详细天气变量作为代理目标进行预训练，并通过自监督特征掩码学习预测大气状态。

Result: 在美国玉米带的763个县中，VITA在预测玉米和大豆产量方面表现最优，尤其在极端天气年份显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: VITA通过领域感知的AI设计克服数据限制，支持气候变化下的农业预测。

Abstract: Accurate crop yield forecasting is essential for global food security.
However, current AI models systematically underperform when yields deviate from
historical trends. This issue arises from key data challenges, including a
major asymmetry between rich pretraining weather datasets and the limited data
available for fine-tuning. We introduce VITA (Variational Inference Transformer
for Asymmetric data), a variational pretraining framework that addresses this
asymmetry. Instead of relying on input reconstruction, VITA uses detailed
weather variables as proxy targets during pretraining and learns to predict
rich atmospheric states through self-supervised feature masking. This allows
the model to be fine-tuned using only basic weather statistics during
deployment. Applied to 763 counties in the U.S. Corn Belt, VITA achieves
state-of-the-art performance in predicting corn and soybean yields across all
evaluation scenarios. While it consistently delivers superior performance under
normal conditions, its advantages are particularly pronounced during extreme
weather years, with statistically significant improvements (paired t-test, $p
\approx 0.01$). Importantly, VITA outperforms prior frameworks like GNN-RNN
using less data, making it more practical for real-world use--particularly in
data-scarce regions. This work highlights how domain-aware AI design can
overcome data limitations and support resilient agricultural forecasting in a
changing climate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NWP模型计算成本高且依赖复杂物理模拟，SolarSeer旨在通过AI直接映射历史卫星数据到未来预测，提高效率和准确性。

Method: SolarSeer利用AI模型直接处理历史卫星观测数据，避免数据同化和偏微分方程求解，实现快速预测。

Result: SolarSeer比HRRR模型在太阳辐照度预测上误差减少27.28%（再分析数据）和15.35%（1800个站点），且速度提升1500倍。

Conclusion: SolarSeer为可持续能源系统提供了快速、准确的太阳辐照度预测支持。

Abstract: Accurate 24-hour solar irradiance forecasting is essential for the safe and
economic operation of solar photovoltaic systems. Traditional numerical weather
prediction (NWP) models represent the state-of-the-art in forecasting
performance but rely on computationally costly data assimilation and solving
complicated partial differential equations (PDEs) that simulate atmospheric
physics. Here, we introduce SolarSeer, an end-to-end large artificial
intelligence (AI) model for solar irradiance forecasting across the Contiguous
United States (CONUS). SolarSeer is designed to directly map the historical
satellite observations to future forecasts, eliminating the computational
overhead of data assimilation and PDEs solving. This efficiency allows
SolarSeer to operate over 1,500 times faster than traditional NWP, generating
24-hour cloud cover and solar irradiance forecasts for the CONUS at 5-kilometer
resolution in under 3 seconds. Compared with the state-of-the-art NWP in the
CONUS, i.e., High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR), SolarSeer significantly
reduces the root mean squared error of solar irradiance forecasting by 27.28%
in reanalysis data and 15.35% across 1,800 stations. SolarSeer also effectively
captures solar irradiance fluctuations and significantly enhances the
first-order irradiance difference forecasting accuracy. SolarSeer's ultrafast,
accurate 24-hour solar irradiance forecasts provide strong support for the
transition to sustainable, net-zero energy systems.

TL;DR: 研究发现，在高维数据（如基因表达）的分类任务中，特征选择（FS）算法并不比随机选择特征更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证特征选择算法在高维数据集中的实际效果，挑战现有研究中基于计算选择的基因提出的药物设计或干预措施。

Method: 通过比较随机选择特征与FS算法选择特征的模型性能，测试FS算法的有效性。

Result: 随机选择的小子集（0.02%-1%）特征与FS算法选择的特征表现相当或更优。

Conclusion: 特征选择在高维数据分类任务中可能无效，需谨慎对待基于计算选择的基因的研究结论。

Abstract: Extensive research has been done on feature selection (FS) algorithms for
high-dimensional datasets aiming to improve model performance, reduce
computational cost and identify features of interest. We test the null
hypothesis of using randomly selected features to compare against features
selected by FS algorithms to validate the performance of the latter. Our
results show that FS on high-dimensional datasets (in particular gene
expression) in classification tasks is not useful. We find that (1) models
trained on small subsets (0.02%-1% of all features) of randomly selected
features almost always perform comparably to those trained on all features, and
(2) a "typical"- sized random subset provides comparable or superior
performance to that of top-k features selected in various published studies.
Thus, our work challenges many feature selection results on high dimensional
datasets, particularly in computational genomics. It raises serious concerns
about studies that propose drug design or targeted interventions based on
computationally selected genes, without further validation in a wet lab.

Abstract: We introduce Goedel-Prover-V2, a series of open-source language models that
set a new state-of-the-art in automated theorem proving. Built on the standard
expert iteration and reinforcement learning pipeline, our approach incorporates
three key innovations: (1) Scaffolded data synthesis: We generate synthetic
tasks of increasing difficulty to train the model to master increasingly
complex theorems; (2) Verifier-guided self-correction: We enable the model to
iteratively revise its proofs by leveraging feedback from the Lean compiler;
(3) Model averaging: We merge model checkpoints to mitigate the decrease in
model output diversity in later stages of training. Our small model,
Goedel-Prover-V2-8B, reaches 84.6% pass@32 on MiniF2F and outperforms
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B under the same metric, despite being 80X smaller. Our
flagship model, Goedel-Prover-V2-32B, achieves 88.1% on MiniF2F at pass@32 in
standard mode and 90.4% in self-correction mode, outperforming prior SOTA by a
large margin. Additionally, our flagship model solves 86 problems on
PutnamBench at pass@184, securing the first place among open-source models on
the leaderboard, surpassing DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B's record of solving 47
problems by pass@1024 with a significantly smaller model size and compute
budget. At the time of its release (July-August 2025), Goedel-Prover-V2
achieves the strongest overall performance among all open-source theorem
provers. It also ranks among the top-performing models--including closed-source
systems with publicly reported performance--under a constrained test-time

Motivation: 解决传统ConvRNN模型中顺序隐藏状态更新的瓶颈问题，同时保留局部空间建模能力。

Result: 在Navier-Stokes动力学和真实世界地转数据任务中，训练速度和预测误差均优于标准ConvLSTM和ConvGRU。

Conclusion: 最小化循环结构与卷积输入聚合结合，为时空序列建模提供了高效且性能优越的替代方案。

Abstract: We introduce MinConvLSTM and MinConvGRU, two novel spatiotemporal models that
combine the spatial inductive biases of convolutional recurrent networks with
the training efficiency of minimal, parallelizable RNNs. Our approach extends
the log-domain prefix-sum formulation of MinLSTM and MinGRU to convolutional
architectures, enabling fully parallel training while retaining localized
spatial modeling. This eliminates the need for sequential hidden state updates
during teacher forcing - a major bottleneck in conventional ConvRNN models. In
addition, we incorporate an exponential gating mechanism inspired by the xLSTM
architecture into the MinConvLSTM, which further simplifies the log-domain
computation. Our models are structurally minimal and computationally efficient,
with reduced parameter count and improved scalability. We evaluate our models
on two spatiotemporal forecasting tasks: Navier-Stokes dynamics and real-world
geopotential data. In terms of training speed, our architectures significantly
outperform standard ConvLSTMs and ConvGRUs. Moreover, our models also achieve
lower prediction errors in both domains, even in closed-loop autoregressive
mode. These findings demonstrate that minimal recurrent structures, when
combined with convolutional input aggregation, offer a compelling and efficient
alternative for spatiotemporal sequence modeling, bridging the gap between
recurrent simplicity and spatial complexity.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and ask:
which structural properties govern their sample complexity? Prior work has
largely tied this complexity to the minimum pairwise separation between
components, but we demonstrate this view is incomplete.
  We introduce the \emph{Pair Correlation Factor} (PCF), a geometric quantity
capturing the clustering of component means. Unlike the minimum gap, the PCF
more accurately dictates the difficulty of parameter recovery.
  In the uniform spherical case, we give an algorithm with improved sample
complexity bounds, showing when more than the usual $\epsilon^{-2}$ samples are
necessary.

Abstract: Identifying the seizure onset zone (SOZ) in patients with focal epilepsy is
essential for surgical treatment and remains challenging due to its dependence
on visual judgment by clinical experts. The development of machine learning can
assist in diagnosis and has made promising progress. However, unlike data in
other fields, medical data is usually collected from individual patients, and
each patient has different illnesses, physical conditions, and medical
histories, which leads to differences in the distribution of each patient's
data. This makes it difficult for a machine learning model to achieve
consistently reliable performance in every new patient dataset, which we refer
to as the "cross-patient problem." In this paper, we propose a method to
fine-tune a pretrained model using patient-specific weights for every new test
patient to improve diagnostic performance. First, the supervised learning
method is used to train a machine learning model. Next, using the intermediate
features of the trained model obtained through the test patient data, the
similarity between the test patient data and each training patient's data is
defined to determine the weight of each training patient to be used in the
following fine-tuning. Finally, we fine-tune all parameters in the pretrained
model with training data and patient weights. In the experiment, the
leave-one-patient-out method is used to evaluate the proposed method, and the
results show improved classification accuracy for every test patient, with an
average improvement of more than 10%.

Abstract: The internal representations learned by deep networks are often sensitive to
architecture-specific choices, raising questions about the stability,
alignment, and transferability of learned structure across models. In this
paper, we investigate how structural constraints--such as linear shaping
operators and corrective paths--affect the compatibility of internal
representations across different architectures. Building on the insights from
prior studies on structured transformations and convergence, we develop a
framework for measuring and analyzing representational alignment across
networks with distinct but related architectural priors. Through a combination
of theoretical insights, empirical probes, and controlled transfer experiments,
we demonstrate that structural regularities induce representational geometry
that is more stable under architectural variation. This suggests that certain
forms of inductive bias not only support generalization within a model, but
also improve the interoperability of learned features across models. We
conclude with a discussion on the implications of representational
transferability for model distillation, modular learning, and the principled
design of robust learning systems.

Abstract: Morphology-aware policy learning is a means of enhancing policy sample
efficiency by aggregating data from multiple agents. These types of policies
have previously been shown to help generalize over dynamic, kinematic, and limb
configuration variations between agent morphologies. Unfortunately, these
policies still have sub-optimal zero-shot performance compared to end-to-end
finetuning on morphologies at deployment. This limitation has ramifications in
practical applications such as robotics because further data collection to
perform end-to-end finetuning can be computationally expensive. In this work,
we investigate combining morphology-aware pretraining with parameter efficient
finetuning (PEFT) techniques to help reduce the learnable parameters necessary
to specialize a morphology-aware policy to a target embodiment. We compare
directly tuning sub-sets of model weights, input learnable adapters, and prefix
tuning techniques for online finetuning. Our analysis reveals that PEFT
techniques in conjunction with policy pre-training generally help reduce the
number of samples to necessary to improve a policy compared to training models
end-to-end from scratch. We further find that tuning as few as less than 1% of
total parameters will improve policy performance compared the zero-shot
performance of the base pretrained a policy.

Motivation: LLMs生成的输出虽然流畅，但缺乏可验证的保证，因此需要一种机制来确保其行为的合规性和可预测性。

Result: 合约层实现了对LLMs的双重视角（语义解析器和概率黑盒组件），并通过程序员定义的条件进行语义验证。

Conclusion: 该工作提出，满足相同合约的任何两个代理在这些合约下是功能等效的，为LLMs的可控性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Generative models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), produce fluent
outputs yet lack verifiable guarantees. We adapt Design by Contract (DbC) and
type-theoretic principles to introduce a contract layer that mediates every LLM
call. Contracts stipulate semantic and type requirements on inputs and outputs,
coupled with probabilistic remediation to steer generation toward compliance.
The layer exposes the dual view of LLMs as semantic parsers and probabilistic
black-box components. Contract satisfaction is probabilistic and semantic
validation is operationally defined through programmer-specified conditions on
well-typed data structures. More broadly, this work postulates that any two
agents satisfying the same contracts are \emph{functionally equivalent} with
respect to those contracts.

incorporating new data with polynomial-time computation, making them
well-suited for safety-critical dynamical systems that require rapid
adaptation. However, the inference and online updates of exact GPs, when
processing streaming data, incur cubic computation time and quadratic storage
memory complexity, limiting their scalability to large datasets in real-time
settings. In this paper, we propose a \underline{s}treaming
\underline{k}ernel-induced progressivel\underline{y} generated expert framework
of \underline{G}aussian \underline{p}rocesses (SkyGP) that addresses both
computational and memory constraints by maintaining a bounded set of experts,
while inheriting the learning performance guarantees from exact Gaussian
processes. Furthermore, two SkyGP variants are introduced, each tailored to a
specific objective, either maximizing prediction accuracy (SkyGP-Dense) or
improving computational efficiency (SkyGP-Fast). The effectiveness of SkyGP is
validated through extensive benchmarks and real-time control experiments
demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

*Lili Chen,Mihir Prabhudesai,Katerina Fragkiadaki,Hao Liu,Deepak Pathak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自问自答框架（SQLM），通过预训练语言模型生成问题并尝试解答，无需外部数据即可提升推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索语言模型是否可以通过自我生成问题和答案来提升推理能力，而无需依赖外部数据。

Method: 方法采用非对称自博弈框架，包括一个生成问题的提议者和一个解答问题的求解器，两者通过强化学习训练。提议者根据问题难度获得奖励，求解者通过多数投票机制获得奖励。

Result: 在三个基准测试（三位数乘法、代数问题和编程问题）上验证了该框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 结论表明，语言模型可以通过自我生成问题和解答来提升性能，无需外部数据集。

Abstract: Can large language models improve without external data -- by generating
their own questions and answers? We hypothesize that a pre-trained language
model can improve its reasoning skills given only a single prompt specifying
the topic (e.g., algebra word problems) and asking the model to generate its
own questions. To do this, we propose Self-Questioning Language Models (SQLM):
an asymmetric self-play framework where a proposer is given the topic and
generates a question for a solver, who tries to answer it. Both the proposer
and solver are trained via reinforcement learning. The proposer receives a
reward if the problem is not too easy or too difficult, and the solver receives
a reward based on majority voting, a proxy for correctness in the absence of
ground-truth answers. For coding, the proposer can instead generate unit tests
which are used for verification. We study this asymmetric self-play framework
on three benchmarks: three-digit multiplication, algebra problems from the
OMEGA benchmark, and programming problems from Codeforces. By continually
generating more interesting problems and attempting to solve them, language
models can improve on downstream benchmarks without access to any curated
training datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统自主性增强，确保其决策与人类偏好一致至关重要。传统IRL方法需要大量人类演示以确保可靠性，但成本高昂。

Method: 提出了PAC-EIG和Reward-EIG两种获取函数，前者最大化关于学徒策略遗憾的信息增益，后者专注于学习奖励函数。

Result: 在有限状态-动作空间中证明了收敛性边界，并通过实验展示了方法的优势。

Conclusion: PAC-EIG为主动IRL提供了首个理论保证，显著提升了策略的可靠性。

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly autonomous, reliably aligning their
decision-making to human preferences is essential. Inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) offers a promising approach to infer preferences from
demonstrations. These preferences can then be used to produce an apprentice
policy that performs well on the demonstrated task. However, in domains like
autonomous driving or robotics, where errors can have serious consequences, we
need not just good average performance but reliable policies with formal
guarantees -- yet obtaining sufficient human demonstrations for reliability
guarantees can be costly. Active IRL addresses this challenge by strategically
selecting the most informative scenarios for human demonstration. We introduce
PAC-EIG, an information-theoretic acquisition function that directly targets
probably-approximately-correct (PAC) guarantees for the learned policy --
providing the first such theoretical guarantee for active IRL with noisy expert
demonstrations. Our method maximises information gain about the regret of the
apprentice policy, efficiently identifying states requiring further
demonstration. We also present Reward-EIG as an alternative when learning the
reward itself is the primary objective. Focusing on finite state-action spaces,
we prove convergence bounds, illustrate failure modes of prior heuristic
methods, and demonstrate our method's advantages experimentally.

Motivation: 扩散模型在说话头部生成中取得了显著进展，但其极慢的推理速度限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出READ框架，包括时空压缩视频潜在空间、预训练语音自动编码器、音频到视频扩散Transformer主干及异步噪声调度器。

Result: 实验表明，READ在生成质量和速度上优于现有方法，并在长时间生成中保持稳定性。

Conclusion: READ实现了质量和速度的最佳平衡，为实时说话头部生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The introduction of diffusion models has brought significant advances to the
field of audio-driven talking head generation. However, the extremely slow
inference speed severely limits the practical implementation of diffusion-based
talking head generation models. In this study, we propose READ, the first
real-time diffusion-transformer-based talking head generation framework. Our
approach first learns a spatiotemporal highly compressed video latent space via
a temporal VAE, significantly reducing the token count to accelerate
generation. To achieve better audio-visual alignment within this compressed
latent space, a pre-trained Speech Autoencoder (SpeechAE) is proposed to
generate temporally compressed speech latent codes corresponding to the video
latent space. These latent representations are then modeled by a carefully
designed Audio-to-Video Diffusion Transformer (A2V-DiT) backbone for efficient
talking head synthesis. Furthermore, to ensure temporal consistency and
accelerated inference in extended generation, we propose a novel asynchronous
noise scheduler (ANS) for both the training and inference process of our
framework. The ANS leverages asynchronous add-noise and asynchronous
motion-guided generation in the latent space, ensuring consistency in generated
video clips. Experimental results demonstrate that READ outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by generating competitive talking head videos with
significantly reduced runtime, achieving an optimal balance between quality and
speed while maintaining robust metric stability in long-time generation.

Motivation: 轨道恢复在数学和应用科学中具有重要意义，尤其是在结构生物学中。本文旨在解决在SO(n)旋转作用下恢复函数轨道的问题。

Method: 通过限制球面分量和离散化径向方向，构建有限维近似空间，并利用三阶不变量（双谱）恢复轨道。对于SO(3)，仅需三个径向样本。

Conclusion: 本文为轨道恢复问题提供了有效的算法，并在蛋白质结构上验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Orbit recovery is a central problem in both mathematics and applied sciences,
with important applications to structural biology. This paper focuses on
recovering generic orbits of functions on ${\mathbb R}^{n}$ and the sphere
$S^{n-1}$ under the rotation action of $SO(n)$. Specifically, we demonstrate
that invariants of degree three (called the bispectrum) suffice to recover
generic orbits of functions in finite-dimensional approximations of
$L^2({\mathbb R}^n)$ obtained by band-limiting the spherical component and
discretizing the radial direction. In particular, our main result explicitly
bounds the number of samples in the radial direction required for recovery from
the degree three invariants. From an application perspective, the most
important case is $SO(3)$, which arises in many scientific fields, and in
particular, plays a central role in leading structural biology applications
such as cryo-electron tomography and cryo-electron microscopy. Our result for
$SO(3)$ states that considering three spherical shells (i.e., samples in the
radial direction) is sufficient to recover generic orbits, which verifies an
implicit conjecture made in a paper of Bandeira et al. Our proof technique
provides an explicit, computationally efficient algorithm to recover the signal
by successively solving systems of linear equations. We implemented this
algorithm and demonstrated its effectiveness on two protein structures.

Abstract: This article presents a mathematical framework for solving Maxwell's
equations in cylindrical and spherical geometries with continuous angular
indices. We extend beyond standard discrete harmonic decomposition to a
continuous spectral representation using generalized spectral integrals,
capturing electromagnetic solutions that exhibit singular behavoiur yet yield
finite-energy fields at the geometric center. For continuous angular indices
$\ell, m \in \mathbb{R}$, we study existence and uniqueness of solutions in
weighted Sobolev spaces $H^s_{\alpha(\ell,m)}(\Omega)$ following the framework
established in ~\cite{adams2003, reed1975}, prove finite energy for $\ell >
-\frac{1}{2}$, and construct explicit spectral kernels via biorthogonal
function systems. The framework encompasses both separable cylindrical modes
with continuous azimuthal index $\nu \in (0,1)$ and non-separable spherical
modes where field components couple through vectorial curl operations. We
present asymptotic analysis of singular field behavior, investigate convergence
rates for spectral approximations, and validate the theoretical framework
through Galerkin projection methods and numerical spectral integration.

Abstract: A common issue in simulating geometric evolution of surfaces is unexpected
clustering of points that may cause numerical instability. We propose a novel
artificial tangential velocity method for this matter. The artificial
tangential velocity is generated from a surface density field governed by a
Fokker-Planck equation to guide the point distribution. A target distribution
matching algorithm is developed leveraging the surface Kullback-Leibler
divergence of density functions. The numerical method is formulated within a
fully meshless framework using the moving least squares approximation, thereby
eliminating the need for mesh generation and allowing flexible treatment of
unstructured point cloud data. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to
demonstrate the robustness, accuracy, and effectiveness of the proposed
approach across a variety of surface evolution problems, including the mean
curvature flow.

Abstract: This paper details the development and application of an $h$-adaptive finite
element method for the numerical solution of the \textit{Falkner-Skan

specifically the well-established \textit{Kelly error estimator}, which
utilizes the jump in the gradient across elements. The implementation of this
method allowed for accurate and efficient resolution of the boundary layer
behavior characteristic of Falkner-Skan flows. Numerical solutions were
obtained across various wedge flow parameters, encompassing favorable and
adverse pressure gradients. A key focus of this study was the precise
computation of the skin friction coefficient, a critical parameter in boundary

Conclusion: 切片Cramér度量在几何变形和噪声环境下表现良好，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: We study the family of sliced Cram\'er metrics, showing that they are robust
to a broad class of geometric deformations. Our central results are that the
sliced Cram\'er distance between a function and its deformation may be bounded
by certain natural measures of the deformation's displacement, multiplied by
the function's mean mixed norm. These results extend to sliced Cram\'er
distances between tomographic projections. We also remark on the effect of
convolution on the sliced Cram\'er metrics. We compare these properties of
sliced Cram\'er metrics to similar properties satisfied by Wasserstein
distances. In addition, we study computationally efficient Fourier-based
discretizations of the Cram\'er and sliced Cram\'er distances in 1D and 2D, and
prove that they are robust to heteroscedastic noise. The results are
illustrated by numerical experiments.

Conclusion: UNO-CG展示了混合方法在高效求解PDE问题中的潜力，兼具数据驱动和传统求解器的优势，具有广泛适用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Rapid and reliable solvers for parametric partial differential equations
(PDEs) are needed in many scientific and engineering disciplines. For example,
there is a growing demand for composites and architected materials with
heterogeneous microstructures. Designing such materials and predicting their
behavior in practical applications requires solving homogenization problems for
a wide range of material parameters and microstructures. While classical
numerical solvers offer reliable and accurate solutions supported by a solid
theoretical foundation, their high computational costs and slow convergence
remain limiting factors. As a result, scientific machine learning is emerging
as a promising alternative. However, such approaches often lack guaranteed
accuracy and physical consistency. This raises the question of whether it is
possible to develop hybrid approaches that combine the advantages of both
data-driven methods and classical solvers. To address this, we introduce
UNO-CG, a hybrid solver that accelerates conjugate gradient (CG) solvers using
specially designed machine-learned preconditioners, while ensuring convergence
by construction. As a preconditioner, we propose Unitary Neural Operators as a
modification of Fourier Neural Operators. Our method can be interpreted as a
data-driven discovery of Green's functions, which are then used to accelerate
iterative solvers. We evaluate UNO-CG on various homogenization problems
involving heterogeneous microstructures and millions of degrees of freedom. Our
results demonstrate that UNO-CG enables a substantial reduction in the number
of iterations and is competitive with handcrafted preconditioners for
homogenization problems that involve expert knowledge. Moreover, UNO-CG
maintains strong performance across a variety of boundary conditions, where
many specialized solvers are not applicable, highlighting its versatility and
robustness.

Conclusion: 为噪声模型的理论研究和地球物理流体模拟中的参数化提供了基础。

Abstract: We investigate transport theoretically and numerically noise-induced
diffusion in flows on the sphere. Previous analysis on the torus demonstrated
that suitably chosen transport noise in the Euler equations leads to diffusive
behavior resembling the Navier--Stokes equations. Here, we analyze dynamics on
the sphere with noise-induced differential elliptic operator dissipation and
characterize their energy and enstrophy decay properties. Through
structure-preserving numerical simulations with the Zeitlin discretization, we
demonstrate that appropriately scaled transport noise induces energy
dissipation while preserving enstrophy and coadjoint orbits. The presented
analysis lays a groundwork for further theoretical investigation of transport
noise and supports the calibration of transport noise models as a
parametrization for unresolved processes in geophysical fluid simulations.

Abstract: This paper proposes a single-domain dual-reciprocity inclusion-based boundary
element method (DR-iBEM) for a three-dimensional fully bonded bi-layered
composite embedded with ellipsoidal inhomogeneities under transient/harmonic
thermal loads. The heat equation is interpreted as a static one containing
time- and frequency-dependent nonhomogeneous source terms, which is similar to
eigen-fields but is transformed into a boundary integral by the
dual-reciprocity method. Using the steady-state bimaterial Green's function,
boundary integral equations are proposed to take into account continuity
conditions of temperature and heat flux, which avoids setting up any continuity
equations at the bimaterial interface. Eigen-temperature-gradients and
eigen-heat-source are introduced to simulate the material mismatch in thermal
conductivity and heat capacity, respectively. The DR-iBEM algorithm is
particularly suitable for investigating the transient and harmonic thermal
behaviors of bi-layered composites and is verified by the finite element method
(FEM). Numerical comparison with the FEM demonstrates its robustness and
accuracy. The method has been applied to a functionally graded material as a
bimaterial with graded particle distributions, where particle size and
gradation effects are evaluated.

Motivation: 由于传统浅水方程（SWE）无法捕捉垂直速度剖面变化，而现有的基于Legendre多项式的浅水矩方程（SWME）仅支持全局多项式，限制了其灵活性。

Result: 数值模拟表明，SSWME模型具有高精度和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SSWME模型在低维度和速度剖面建模之间取得了更好的平衡，适用于自由表面流动的简化建模。

Abstract: Reduced models for free-surface flows are required due to the high
dimensionality of the underlying incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, which
need to fully resolve the flow in vertical direction to compute the surface
height. On the other hand, standard reduced models, such as the classical
Shallow Water Equations (SWE), which assume a small depth-to-length ratio and
use depth-averaging, do not provide information about the vertical velocity
profile variations. As a compromise, a recently proposed moment approach for
shallow flow using Legendre polynomials as ansatz functions for vertical
velocity variations showed the derivation of so-called Shallow Water Moment
Equations (SWME) that combine low dimensionality with velocity profile
modeling. However, only global polynomials are considered so far.
  This paper introduces Spline Shallow Water Moment Equations (SSWME) where
piecewise defined spline ansatz functions allow for a flexible representation
of velocity profiles with lower regularity. The local support of the spline
basis functions opens up the possibility of adaptability and greater
flexibility regarding some typical profile shapes. We systematically derive and
analyze hierarchies of SSWME models with different number of basis functions
and different degrees, before deriving a regularized hyperbolic version by
performing a hyperbolic regularization with analytical proof of hyperbolicity
for a hierarchy of high-order SSWME models. Numerical simulations show high
accuracy and robustness of the new models.

Conclusion: 提出的预处理方法显著提升了PINNs的收敛性，适用于复杂问题。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a popular
approach for solving forward and inverse problems involving partial
differential equations (PDEs). Compared to fully connected neural networks,
PINNs based on convolutional neural networks offer advantages in the hard
enforcement of boundary conditions and in reducing the computational cost of
partial derivatives. However, the latter still struggles with slow convergence
and even failure in some scenarios. In this study, we propose a matrix
preconditioning method to improve the convergence of the latter. Specifically,
we combine automatic differentiation with matrix coloring to compute the
Jacobian matrix of the PDE system, which is used to construct the
preconditioner via incomplete LU factorization. We subsequently use the
preconditioner to scale the PDE residual in the loss function in order to
reduce the condition number of the Jacobian matrix, which is key to improving
the convergence of PINNs. To overcome the incompatibility between automatic
differentiation and triangular solves in the preconditioning, we also design a
framework based on the adjoint method to compute the gradients of the loss
function with respect to the network parameters. By numerical experiments, we
validate that the proposed method successfully and efficiently solves the
multi-scale problem and the high Reynolds number problem, in both of which
PINNs fail to obtain satisfactory results.

Abstract: In certain practical engineering applications, there is an urgent need to
perform repetitive solving of partial differential equations (PDEs) in a short
period. This paper primarily considers three scenarios requiring extensive
repetitive simulations. These three scenarios are categorized based on whether
the geometry, boundary conditions(BCs), or parameters vary. We introduce the
DD-DeepONet, a framework with strong scalability, whose core concept involves
decomposing complex geometries into simple structures and vice versa. We
primarily study complex geometries composed of rectangles and cuboids, which
have numerous practical applications. Simultaneously, stretching
transformations are applied to simple geometries to solve shape-dependent
problems. This work solves several prototypical PDEs in three scenarios,
including Laplace, Poission, N-S, and drift-diffusion equations, demonstrating
DD-DeepONet's computational potential. Experimental results demonstrate that
DD-DeepONet reduces training difficulty, requires smaller datasets andVRAMper
network, and accelerates solution acquisition.

Abstract: The quantitative modeling and design of modern short-pulse fiber lasers
cannot be performed with averaged models because of large variations in the
pulse parameters within each round trip. Instead, lumped models obtained by
concatenating models for the various components of the laser are required.
Since the optical pulses in lumped models are periodic, their linear stability
is investigated using the monodromy operator, which is the linearization of the
roundtrip operator about the pulse. A gradient-based optimization method is
developed to discover periodic pulses. The computation of the gradient of the
objective function involves numerical computation of the action of both the
round trip operator and the adjoint of the monodromy operator. A novel Fourier
split-step method is introduced to compute solutions of the linearization of
the nonlinear, nonlocal, stiff equation that models optical propagation in the
fiber amplifier. This method is derived by linearizing the two solution
operators in a split-step method for the nonlinear equation. The spectrum of
the monodromy operator consists of the essential spectrum, for which there is
an analytical formula, and the eigenvalues. There is a multiplicity two
eigenvalue at $\lambda=1$, which is due to phase and translation invariance.
The remaining eigenvalues are determined from a matrix discretization of the
monodromy operator. Simulation results verify the accuracy of the numerical
methods, show examples of periodically stationary pulses, their spectra and
eigenfunctions, and discuss their stability.

Abstract: This paper presents the formulation and analysis of a mixed finite element
method for a hemivariational inequality arising from the stationary convective
Brinkman-Forchheimer extended Darcy (CBFeD) equations. This model extends the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations by incorporating both damping and
pumping effects. The hemivariational inequality describes the flow of a
viscous, incompressible fluid through a saturated porous medium, subject to a
nonsmooth, nonconvex friction-type slip boundary condition. The
incompressibility constraint is handled via a mixed variational formulation. We
establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions by utilizing the
pseudomonotonicity and coercivity properties of the underlying operators and
provide a detailed error analysis of the proposed numerical scheme. Under
suitable regularity assumptions, the method achieves optimal convergence rates
with low-order mixed finite element pairs. The scheme is implemented using the
$\text{P1b/P1}$ element pair, and numerical experiments are presented to
validate the theoretical results and confirm the expected convergence behavior.

Conclusion: 提出的Nitsche方法在H(curl)框架下成功解决了无滑移边界条件的施加问题，具有稳定性和最优收敛性。

Abstract: In this work, we show how to impose no-slip boundary conditions for an
H(curl)-based formulation for incompressible Stokes flow, which is used in
structure-preserving discretizations of Navier-Stokes and magnetohydrodynamics
equations. At first glance, it seems straightforward to apply no-slip boundary
conditions: the tangential part is an essential boundary condition on H(curl)
and the normal component can be naturally enforced through integration-by-parts
of the divergence term. However, we show that this can lead to an ill-posed
discretization and propose a Nitsche-based finite element method instead. We
analyze the discrete system, establishing stability and deriving a priori error
estimates. Numerical experiments validate our analysis and demonstrate optimal
convergence rates for the velocity field.

Abstract: The efficient approximation of quantity of interest derived from PDEs with
lognormal diffusivity is a central challenge in uncertainty quantification. In
this study, we propose a multilevel quasi-Monte Carlo framework to approximate
deterministic, real-valued, bounded linear functionals that depend on the
solution of a linear elliptic PDE with a lognormal diffusivity coefficient
{parameterized by a 49-dimensional Gaussian random vector} and deterministic
geometric singularities in bounded domains of $\mathbb{R}^d$. We analyze the
parametric regularity and develop the multilevel implementation based on a
sequence of adaptive meshes, developed in "Goal-oriented adaptive finite
element multilevel Monte Carlo with convergence rates", \emph{CMAME}, 402
(2022), p. 115582. For further variance reduction, we incorporate importance
sampling and introduce a level-0 control variate within the multilevel
hierarchy. {Introducing such control variate can alter the optimal choice of
initial mesh, further highlighting the advantages of adaptive meshes.}
Numerical experiments demonstrate that our adaptive QMC algorithm achieves a
prescribed accuracy at substantially lower computational cost than the standard
multilevel Monte Carlo method.

recently proposed high-order estimates of drift and covariance for dealing with
stochastic problems with augmented libraries to handle delayed arguments. Three
different strategies are discussed in view of exploiting only realistically
available data. A thorough comparative numerical investigation is performed on
different models, which helps guiding the choice of effective and possibly

Conclusion: JLRST方法通过子空间框架和新型正则化技术，有效解决了高光谱图像超分辨率的挑战，具有高效和准确的优势。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image super-resolution (HSI-SR) has emerged as a challenging
yet critical problem in remote sensing. Existing approaches primarily focus on
regularization techniques that leverage low-rankness and local smoothness
priors. Recently, correlated total variation has been introduced for tensor
recovery, integrating these priors into a single regularization framework.
Direct application to HSI-SR, however, is hindered by the high spectral
dimensionality of hyperspectral data. In this paper, we propose a unified
tensor regularizer, called JLRST, which jointly encodes low-rankness and local
smoothness priors under a subspace framework. Specifically, we compute the
gradients of the clustered coefficient tensors along all three tensor modes to
fully exploit spectral correlations and nonlocal similarities in HSI. By
enforcing priors on subspace coefficients rather than the entire HR-HSI data,
the proposed method achieves improved computational efficiency and accuracy.
Furthermore, to mitigate the bias introduced by the tensor nuclear norm (TNN),
we introduce the mode-3 logarithmic TNN to process gradient tensors. An
alternating direction method of multipliers with proven convergence is
developed to solve the proposed model. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in HSI-SR.

Abstract: This study introduces a data-driven twin modeling framework based on modern
Koopman operator theory, offering a significant advancement over classical
modal decomposition by accurately capturing nonlinear dynamics with reduced
complexity and no manual parameter adjustment. The method integrates a novel
algorithm with Pareto front analysis to construct a compact, high-fidelity
reduced-order model that balances accuracy and efficiency. An explainable NLARX
deep learning framework enables real-time, adaptive calibration and prediction,
while a key innovation-computing orthogonal Koopman modes via randomized
orthogonal projections-ensures optimal data representation. This approach for
data-driven twin modeling is fully self-consistent, avoiding heuristic choices
and enhancing interpretability through integrated explainable learning
techniques. The proposed method is demonstrated on shock wave phenomena using
three experiments of increasing complexity, accompanied by a qualitative
analysis of the resulting data-driven twin models.

Conclusion: PINNs结合vWERP框架可提供高精度、高时间分辨率的血流动力学估计。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) show significant potential for
solving inverse problems, especially when observations are limited and sparse,
provided that the relevant physical equations are known. We use PINNs to
estimate smooth velocity and pressure fields from synthetic 4D flow Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. We analyze five non-Newtonian dynamic 3D blood
flow cases within a realistic aortic model, covering a range of hematocrit
values from anemic to polycythemic conditions. To enhance state estimation
results, we consider various design and training techniques for PINNs,
including adaptive loss balancing, curriculum training, and a realistic
measurement operator. Regarding blood rheology, the PINN approach accurately
estimates viscosity globally and locally under peak systolic conditions. It
also provides a clear pattern recognition for diastolic stages. Regarding mass
conservation, PINN estimations effectively reproduce the bifurcation of flow
through the different branches of the aorta, demonstrate an excellent
representation of the non-slip conditions at the walls, and accurately estimate
pressure drops with relative errors below the 5% in the whole pressure field.
We test our pressure drop estimations against the state of the art Virtual Work
Energy Relative Pressure (vWERP) estimator, and we observe how our results
outperform vWERP in terms of both accuracy and time resolution. Additionally,
we find that the best results are achieved by computing the velocity field
using the PINN, which is then integrated into the vWERP framework, leading to
time super-sampled and high-order approximations, with a clinically admissible
accuracy.

Abstract: In this paper, we develop two energy-preserving splitting methods for solving

We use operator splitting methods to decouple stochastic Maxwell equations into

spatial compact difference methods and the midpoint rule in time discretization
for the deterministic parts, and exact unitary analytical solutions for the
stochastic parts. Theoretical proofs show that both methods strictly preserve
the discrete energy conservation law. Finally, numerical experiments fully
verify the energy conservation of the methods and demonstrate that the temporal
convergence order of the two splitting methods is first-order.

Abstract: As the size of a mechanical lattice with beam-modeled edges approaches zero,
it undergoes homogenization into a continuum model, which exhibits unusual
mechanical properties that deviate from classical Cauchy elasticity, named
micropolar elasticity. Typically, the homogenization process is qualitative in
the engineering community, lacking quantitative homogenization error estimates.
In this paper, we rigorously analyze the homogenization process of a beam
lattice to a continuum. Our approach is initiated from an engineered mechanical
problem defined on a triangular lattice with periodic boundary conditions. By
applying Fourier transformations, we reduce the problem to a series of
equations in the frequency domain. As the lattice size approaches zero, this
yields a homogenized model in the form of a partial differential equation with
periodic boundary conditions. This process can be easily justified if the
external conditions in the frequency domain are nonzero only at low-frequency
modes. However, through numerical experiments, we discover that beyond the
low-frequency regime, the homogenization of the beam lattice differs from
classical periodic homogenization theory due to the additional rotational
degrees of freedom in the beams. A crucial technique in our analysis is the
decoupling of displacement and rotation fields, achieved through a linear
algebraic manipulation known as the Schur complement. Through dedicated
analysis, we establish the coercivity of the Schur complements in both lattice
and continuum models, which enables us to derive convergence rate estimates for
homogenization errors. Numerical experiments validate the optimality of the
homogenization rate estimates.
