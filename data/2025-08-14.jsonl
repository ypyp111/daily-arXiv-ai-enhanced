In this paper, we demonstrate that the unstable\nPDI is primarily induced by the conformation boundary conditions additionally\nintroduced in the ACD equation system, which could be eliminated if a new set\nof conformation conditions is adopted. To address this issue, we begin with an\nasymptotic analysis of the PDI within the near-wall thin diffusive layer, which\nsimplifies the complexity of the instability system by reducing the number of\nthe controlling parameters from five to zero.

To improve their performance, source-free domain\nadaptation (SFDA) methods have been proposed to personalize a pretrained source\nmodel using only unlabeled target domain data, thereby avoiding data privacy,\nstorage, and transmission constraints. This paper addresses a challenging\nscenario where source data is unavailable for adaptation, and only unlabeled\ntarget data consisting solely of neutral expressions is available.

An extended sensitivity analysis is presented, using random forest\n(RF) regression to evaluate multilayer truncation effects and validate the\nalignment of theoretical predictions with practical network behaviors. To\naccommodate different application scenarios, this article proposes two\ntruncation strategies (coarse-grained and fine-grained), which apply diverse\nsequence length configurations at each layer. Evaluations on a pipelined SC MLP\nsynthesized at 32nm demonstrate that ASL can reduce energy and latency\noverheads by up to over 60% with negligible accuracy loss. It confirms the\nfeasibility of the ASL scheme for IoT applications and highlights the distinct\nadvantages of mixed-precision truncation in SC designs."}

To address this\nchallenge, we propose TokenCast, an LLM-driven framework that leverages\nlanguage-based symbolic representations as a unified intermediary for\ncontext-aware time series forecasting. Specifically, TokenCast employs a\ndiscrete tokenizer to transform continuous numerical sequences into temporal\ntokens, enabling structural alignment with language-based inputs.

However, their direct application to hyperspectral\nremote sensing remains challenging due to inherent spectral disparities and the\nscarcity of available observations. In this work, we present HyperKD, a novel\nknowledge distillation framework that enables transferring learned\nrepresentations from a teacher model into a student model for effective\ndevelopment of a foundation model on hyperspectral images. Unlike typical\nknowledge distillation frameworks, which use a complex teacher to guide a\nsimpler student, HyperKD enables an inverse form of knowledge transfer across\ndifferent types of spectral data, guided by a simpler teacher model. Building\nupon a Masked Autoencoder, HyperKD distills knowledge from the Prithvi\nfoundational model into a student tailored for EnMAP hyperspectral imagery.\nHyperKD addresses the inverse domain adaptation problem with spectral gaps by\nintroducing a feature-based strategy that includes spectral range-based channel\nalignment, spatial feature-guided masking, and an enhanced loss function\ntailored for hyperspectral images. HyperKD bridges the substantial spectral\ndomain gap, enabling the effective use of pretrained foundation models for\ngeospatial applications.

However, most existing methods only apply to human figures, which\nusually do not generalize well on anthropomorphic characters commonly used in\nindustries like gaming and entertainment. Furthermore, previous methods could\nonly generate videos with static backgrounds, which limits the realism of the\nvideos. For the first challenge, our in-depth analysis suggests to attribute\nthis limitation to their insufficient modeling of motion, which is unable to\ncomprehend the movement pattern of the driving video, thus imposing a pose\nsequence rigidly onto the target character. To this end, this paper proposes\nAnimate-X++, a universal animation framework based on DiT for various character\ntypes, including anthropomorphic characters. To enhance motion representation,\nwe introduce the Pose Indicator, which captures comprehensive motion pattern\nfrom the driving video through both implicit and explicit manner. The former\nleverages CLIP visual features of a driving video to extract its gist of\nmotion, like the overall movement pattern and temporal relations among motions,\nwhile the latter strengthens the generalization of DiT by simulating possible\ninputs in advance that may arise during inference.

This mismatch suggests that current\nevaluation standards may overestimate the effectiveness of such attacks. To\naddress this issue, we introduce a four-axis evaluation framework that\nconsiders input on-topicness, input out-of-distribution (OOD) intensity, output\nharmfulness, and output refusal rate. This framework identifies truly effective\njailbreaks.

Building on this insight, we develop a\nrecursive rewriting strategy called Balanced Structural Decomposition (BSD).\nThe approach restructures malicious prompts into semantically aligned\nsub-tasks, while introducing subtle OOD signals and visual cues that make the\ninputs harder to detect.

Traditional methods, such\nas Delphi studies, consensus conferences, and systematic guideline synthesis,\noffer structure but face limitations including high panel burden, interpretive\noversimplification, and suppression of conditional nuance. These challenges are\nnow exacerbated by information overload, fragmentation of the evidence base,\nand increasing reliance on publicly available sources that lack expert\nfiltering. This study introduces and evaluates a Human-AI Hybrid Delphi\n(HAH-Delphi) framework designed to augment expert consensus development by\nintegrating a generative AI model (Gemini 2.5 Pro), small panels of senior\nhuman experts, and structured facilitation. The HAH-Delphi was tested in three\nphases: retrospective replication, prospective comparison, and applied\ndeployment in two applied domains (endurance training and resistance and mixed\ncardio/strength training). The AI replicated 95% of published expert consensus\nconclusions in Phase I and showed 95% directional agreement with senior human\nexperts in Phase II, though it lacked experiential and pragmatic nuance. In\nPhase III, compact panels of six senior experts achieved >90% consensus\ncoverage and reached thematic saturation before the final participant. The AI\nprovided consistent, literature-grounded scaffolding that supported divergence\nresolution and accelerated saturation. The HAH-Delphi framework offers a\nflexible, scalable approach for generating high-quality, context-sensitive\nconsensus. Its successful application across health, coaching, and performance\nscience confirms its methodological robustness and supports its use as a\nfoundation for generating conditional, personalised guidance and published\nconsensus frameworks at scale."}

Furthermore, Thermal Tracks excels at analyzing\nproteins with un-conventional melting profiles, including phase-separating\nproteins and membrane proteins, which often exhibit complex, non-sigmoidal\nthermal stability behaviors. Thermal Tracks is freely available from GitHub and\nis implemented in Python, providing an accessible and flexible tool for\nproteome-wide thermal profiling studies."}

Initially, a noise estimation module is employed to adaptively\nassess the noise levels present in transient data. Subsequently, a\nparameterized neural operator is developed to approximate the inverse mapping,\nfacilitating end-to-end rapid image reconstruction. Our 3D image reconstruction\nframework, grounded in operator learning, is constructed through deep algorithm\nunfolding, which not only provides commendable model interpretability but also\nenables dynamic adaptation to varying noise levels in the acquired data,\nthereby ensuring consistently robust and accurate reconstruction outcomes.\nFurthermore, we introduce a novel method for the fusion of global and local\nspatiotemporal data features. By integrating structural and detailed\ninformation, this method significantly enhances both accuracy and robustness.\nComprehensive numerical experiments conducted on both simulated and real\ndatasets substantiate the efficacy of the proposed method. It demonstrates\nremarkable performance with fast scanning data and sparse illumination point\ndata, offering a viable solution for NLOS imaging in complex scenarios."}

Traditionally, experts propose significant features and\nevaluate them using physics equations. However, the complexity of the human\nbody and its movements makes it challenging to explicitly analyze the\nrelationships between some features and athletes' final performance. With\nadvancements in modern machine learning and statistics, data analytics methods\nhave gained increasing importance in sports analytics. In this study, we\nleverage machine learning models to analyze expert-proposed biomechanical\nfeatures from the finals of long jump competitions in the World Championships.\nThe objectives of the analysis include identifying the most important features\ncontributing to top-performing jumps and exploring the combined effects of\nthese key features. Using quantile regression, we model the relationship\nbetween the biomechanical feature set and the target variable (effective\ndistance), with a particular focus on elite-level jumps. To interpret the\nmodel, we apply SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) alongside Partial\nDependence Plots (PDPs) and Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots. The\nfindings reveal that, beyond the well-documented velocity-related features,\nspecific technical aspects also play a pivotal role. For male athletes, the\nangle of the knee of the supporting leg before take-off is identified as a key\nfactor for achieving top 10% performance in our dataset, with angles greater\nthan 169{\\deg}contributing significantly to jump performance.

[2] Data gathered by recent studies shows that\nthough poaching methods remain the same, the poaching grounds are rather\ndynamic. Poachers have shifted to areas with less ranger patrols and several\nother factors like watering holes, seasons, altitude etc. cause constant shifts\nin poaching hotspot locations.

However, their direct application to hyperspectral\nremote sensing remains challenging due to inherent spectral disparities and the\nscarcity of available observations. In this work, we present HyperKD, a novel\nknowledge distillation framework that enables transferring learned\nrepresentations from a teacher model into a student model for effective\ndevelopment of a foundation model on hyperspectral images. Unlike typical\nknowledge distillation frameworks, which use a complex teacher to guide a\nsimpler student, HyperKD enables an inverse form of knowledge transfer across\ndifferent types of spectral data, guided by a simpler teacher model. Building\nupon a Masked Autoencoder, HyperKD distills knowledge from the Prithvi\nfoundational model into a student tailored for EnMAP hyperspectral imagery.\nHyperKD addresses the inverse domain adaptation problem with spectral gaps by\nintroducing a feature-based strategy that includes spectral range-based channel\nalignment, spatial feature-guided masking, and an enhanced loss function\ntailored for hyperspectral images. HyperKD bridges the substantial spectral\ndomain gap, enabling the effective use of pretrained foundation models for\ngeospatial applications. Extensive experiments show that HyperKD significantly\nimproves representation learning in MAEs, leading to enhanced reconstruction\nfidelity and more robust performance on downstream tasks such as land cover\nclassification, crop type identification, and soil organic carbon prediction,\nunderpinning the potential of knowledge distillation frameworks in remote\nsensing analytics with hyperspectral imagery."}

Recent\nmethods have improved reasoning through expanded corpus and multistage training\ncombining reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning. Although some\nmethods suggest that small but targeted dataset can incentivize reasoning via\nonly distillation, a reasoning scaling laws is still taking shape, increasing\ncomputational costs. To address this, we propose a data-efficient distillation\nframework (DED) that optimizes the Pareto frontier of reasoning distillation.\nInspired by the on-policy learning and diverse roll-out strategies of\nreinforcement learning, the key idea of our approach is threefold: (1) We\nidentify that benchmark scores alone do not determine an effective teacher\nmodel. Through comprehensive comparisons of leading reasoning LLMs, we develop\na method to select an optimal teacher model. (2) While scaling distillation can\nenhance reasoning, it often degrades out-of-domain performance. A carefully\ncurated, smaller corpus achieves a balanced trade-off between in-domain and\nout-of-domain capabilities. (3) Diverse reasoning trajectories encourage the\nstudent model to develop robust reasoning skills. We validate our method\nthrough evaluations on mathematical reasoning (AIME 2024/2025, MATH-500) and\ncode generation (LiveCodeBench), achieving state-of-the-art results with only\n0.8k carefully curated examples, bypassing the need for extensive scaling.

However, some tasks (i.e., queries) may be too specialized\nand difficult for a single LLM to handle alone. These applications often\nbenefit from breaking down the task into smaller subtasks, each of which can\nthen be executed by a LLM expected to perform well on that specific subtask.\nFor example, in extracting a diagnosis from medical records, one can first\nselect an LLM to summarize the record, select another to validate the summary,\nand then select another, possibly different, LLM to extract the diagnosis from\nthe summarized record.

In this work, we introduce AST-n, an accelerated\ninference framework that initiates reverse diffusion from intermediate noise\nlevels, and integrate high-order ODE solvers within conditioned models to\nfurther reduce sampling steps. We evaluate two acceleration paradigms--AST-n\nsampling and standard scheduling with high-order solvers -- on the Low Dose CT\nGrand Challenge dataset, covering head, abdominal, and chest scans at 10-25 %\nof standard dose. Conditioned models using only 25 steps (AST-25) achieve peak\nsignal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) above 38 dB and structural similarity index (SSIM)\nabove 0.95, closely matching standard baselines while cutting inference time\nfrom ~16 seg to under 1 seg per slice. Unconditional sampling suffers\nsubstantial quality loss, underscoring the necessity of conditioning. We also\nassess DDIM inversion, which yields marginal PSNR gains at the cost of doubling\ninference time, limiting its clinical practicality.

However, their ability to\ngenerate code from multimodal inputs remains limited. In this work, we\nintroduce VisCodex, a unified framework that seamlessly merges vision and\ncoding language models to empower MLLMs with strong multimodal code generation\nabilities. Leveraging a task vector-based model merging technique, we integrate\na state-of-the-art coding LLM into a strong vision-language backbone, while\npreserving both visual comprehension and advanced coding skills. To support\ntraining and evaluation, we introduce the Multimodal Coding Dataset (MCD), a\nlarge-scale and diverse collection of 598k samples, including high-quality HTML\ncode, chart image-code pairs, image-augmented StackOverflow QA, and algorithmic\nproblems. Furthermore, we propose InfiBench-V, a novel and challenging\nbenchmark specifically designed to assess models on visually-rich, real-world\nprogramming questions that demand a nuanced understanding of both textual and\nvisual contexts. Extensive experiments show that VisCodex achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs and approaches proprietary\nmodels like GPT-4o, highlighting the effectiveness of our model merging\nstrategy and new datasets."}

Despite the improvements of\nthis approach, an important limitation emerges: the substantial increase in\ncomputation time makes the process slow and impractical for many applications.\nGiven the success of this paradigm and its growing usage, we seek to preserve\nits benefits while eschewing the inference overhead. In this work we propose\none solution to the critical problem of integrating test-time scaling knowledge\ninto a model during post-training. Specifically, we replace reward guided\ntest-time noise optimization in diffusion models with a Noise Hypernetwork that\nmodulates initial input noise. We propose a theoretically grounded framework\nfor learning this reward-tilted distribution for distilled generators, through\na tractable noise-space objective that maintains fidelity to the base model\nwhile optimizing for desired characteristics. We show that our approach\nrecovers a substantial portion of the quality gains from explicit test-time\noptimization at a fraction of the computational cost.
