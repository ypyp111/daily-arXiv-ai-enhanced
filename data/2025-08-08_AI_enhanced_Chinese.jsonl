Traditional methods, such as\nextreme downsampling or transformation from the spatial to the frequency\ndomain, encounter significant drawbacks: downsampling induces irreversible\ninformation loss in UHD images, while our frequency analysis reveals that pure\nfrequency-domain approaches are ineffective for spatially confined image\nartifacts, primarily due to the loss of degradation locality. To overcome these\nlimitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework\ndesigned for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary\nsub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination\nAdaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component,\nutilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba,\nwhich effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details. On the\nother hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination\ndistortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global\ncontext provided by it. Evaluating RetinexDual on four UHD IR tasks, namely\nderaining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE), shows\nthat it outperforms recent methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

Submitted to an IEEE conference", "summary": "Generative models have demonstrated significant success in anomaly detection\nand segmentation over the past decade. Recently, diffusion models have emerged\nas a powerful alternative, outperforming previous approaches such as GANs and\nVAEs. In typical diffusion-based anomaly detection, a model is trained on\nnormal data, and during inference, anomalous images are perturbed to a\npredefined intermediate step in the forward diffusion process. The\ncorresponding normal image is then reconstructed through iterative reverse\nsampling.\n  However, reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1)\nthe reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple\nsampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or\nsubtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal\npattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate\nintermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and\noften assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in\nunsupervised settings.\n  We introduce Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based\ndiffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which overcomes the limitations of\nreconstruction-based anomaly detection. Unlike current SOTA methods that\nreconstruct the input image, RADAR directly produces anomaly maps from the\ndiffusion model, improving both detection accuracy and computational\nefficiency. We evaluate RADAR on real-world 3D-printed material and the\nMVTec-AD dataset. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and\nstatistical machine learning models across all key metrics, including accuracy,\nprecision, recall, and F1 score.

Despite advances in alignment models, their interpretability remains\nlimited, making it difficult to understand alignment decisions and posing\nchallenges in building trust, particularly in high-stakes domains. To address\nthis, we introduce NAEx, a plug-and-play, model-agnostic framework that\nexplains alignment models by identifying key subgraphs and features influencing\npredictions. NAEx addresses the key challenge of preserving the joint\ncross-network dependencies on alignment decisions by: (1) jointly\nparameterizing graph structures and feature spaces through learnable edge and\nfeature masks, and (2) introducing an optimization objective that ensures\nexplanations are both faithful to the original predictions and enable\nmeaningful comparisons of structural and feature-based similarities between\nnetworks. NAEx is an inductive framework that efficiently generates NA\nexplanations for previously unseen data.

The hydrogen jet, with a momentum flux ratio of five,\nis injected into a high enthalpy crossflow. The sensitivities of the solution\nto the grid element size and polynomial order are investigated to determine an\naccurate and computationally efficient approach to simulating high-speed\nairbreathing propulsion vehicles. The results demonstrate that DG(p = 2)\nsolutions, which are nominally third-order accurate in smooth regions of the\nflow, show reasonable agreement with existing experimental results. The\nseparation shock formation behind the jet is found to be heavily grid dependent\nand necessary for accurate simulations of the reacting jet in supersonic\ncrossflow. It is determined that the highest resolution cell and polynomial\norder is required to capture the upstream separation shock and consequently the\nflame stabilization point. The mixing and combustion mode is also determined\nusing the flame index and demonstrates the flow is heavily skewed towards a\nnon-premixed diffusion mode which is consistent with previously run simulations\nof this case using traditional finite volume schemes and sub grid scale\nmodeling approaches. Beyond this analysis, the novelty of this work lies in\ndemonstrating a high-speed, multicomponent, chemically reacting flow on a fully\nunstructured tetrahedral mesh: a first-of-its-kind calculation.

While recent advanced large reasoning models like\nDeepSeek-R1 employ reinforcement learning for an extended ``thinking'' process,\ntheir reasoning can be verbose and lack relevance. We introduce AttriLens-Mol,\nan attribute-guided reinforcement learning framework for molecular property\nprediction with LLMs. AttriLens-Mol steers the model's reasoning by using: (1)\na format reward encouraging attribute-based structured output, (2) a count\nreward to avoid enumerating irrelevant attributes, and (3) a rationality reward\nusing advanced LLMs and RDKit to verify the relatedness of the generated\nattributes. This approach implicitly elicits the model's inherent knowledge of\nrelevant molecular attributes during reasoning, enables making predictions for\nthe molecular property more effectively.

InfoQ assesses layer sensitivity by quantizing each\nlayer at different bit-widths and measuring, through a single forward pass, the\nresulting change in mutual information in the subsequent layers. This\nquantifies how much each layer quantization impacts the network information\nflow. The resulting scores are used to formulate bit-width allocation as an\ninteger linear programming problem, which is solved efficiently to minimize\ntotal sensitivity under a given budget (e.g., model size or BitOps). Our\nretraining-free search phase provides a superior search-time/accuracy trade-off\n(using two orders of magnitude less data compared to state-of-the-art methods\nsuch as LIMPQ), while yielding up to a 1% accuracy improvement for MobileNetV2\nand ResNet18 on ImageNet at high compression rates (14X and 10.66X).", "AI": {"tldr": "InfoQ\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u6d4b\u91cf\u5c42\u95f4\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u53d8\u5316\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5c42\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u914d\u6bd4\u7279\u5bbd\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u6216\u5c40\u90e8\u654f\u611f\u6027\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4ee3\u7406\uff08\u5982Hessian\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u91cf\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u7ea7\u8054\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faInfoQ\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u6bcf\u5c42\u4e0d\u540c\u6bd4\u7279\u5bbd\u5ea6\u5e76\u6d4b\u91cf\u540e\u7eed\u5c42\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u53d8\u5316\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5c42\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u6bd4\u7279\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet\u4e0a\uff0cMobileNetV2\u548cResNet18\u5728\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u7387\uff0814X\u548c10.66X\uff09\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e861%\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982LIMPQ\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "InfoQ\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u654f\u611f\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6bd4\u7279\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, LLMs exhibit notable\nlimitations, such as overly aggressive insulin dosing when prompted with\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, highlighting critical failure modes including\narithmetic hallucination, temporal misinterpretation, and inconsistent clinical\nlogic. Incorporating explicit reasoning about latent clinical states (e.g.,\nmeals) yielded minimal performance gains, underscoring the current model's\nlimitations in capturing complex, hidden physiological dynamics solely through\ntextual inference. Our findings advocate for cautious yet optimistic\nintegration of LLMs into clinical workflows, emphasising the necessity of\ntargeted prompt engineering, careful validation, and potentially hybrid\napproaches that combine linguistic reasoning with structured physiological\nmodelling to achieve safe, robust, and clinically effective decision-support\nsystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0b\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u80f0\u5c9b\u7d20\u5242\u91cf\u8c03\u6574\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5c0f\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5242\u91cf\u8fc7\u6fc0\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u6cbb\u7597\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22LLMs\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u76841\u578b\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5f00\u6e90LLMs\u4e0e\u5c0f\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u60a3\u8005\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5242\u91cf\u8fc7\u6fc0\u3001\u7b97\u672f\u5e7b\u89c9\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u8bae\u8c28\u614e\u6574\u5408LLMs\u5230\u4e34\u5e8a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u751f\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Weakly\nSupervised DSGG (WS-DSGG) reduces annotation workload by using an unlocalized\nscene graph from a single frame per video for training. Existing WS-DSGG\nmethods depend on an off-the-shelf external object detector to generate pseudo\nlabels for subsequent DSGG training. However, detectors trained on static,\nobject-centric images struggle in dynamic, relation-aware scenarios required\nfor DSGG, leading to inaccurate localization and low-confidence proposals. To\naddress the challenges posed by external object detectors in WS-DSGG, we\npropose a Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring (TRKT)\nmethod, which leverages knowledge to enhance detection in relation-aware\ndynamic scenarios. TRKT is built on two key components:(1)Relation-aware\nknowledge mining: we first employ object and relation class decoders that\ngenerate category-specific attention maps to highlight both object regions and\ninteractive areas. Then we propose an Inter-frame Attention Augmentation\nstrategy that exploits optical flow for neighboring frames to enhance the\nattention maps, making them motion-aware and robust to motion blur. This step\nyields relation- and motion-aware knowledge mining for WS-DSGG.

It is\nrapidly evolving into a general-purpose infrastructure that reshapes how\nknowledge is generated, mediated, and validated. This paper presents findings\nfrom a controlled experiment evaluating a Socratic AI Tutor, a large language\nmodel designed to scaffold student research question development through\nstructured dialogue grounded in constructivist theory. Conducted with 65\npre-service teacher students in Germany, the study compares interaction with\nthe Socratic Tutor to engagement with an uninstructed AI chatbot. Students\nusing the Socratic Tutor reported significantly greater support for critical,\nindependent, and reflective thinking, suggesting that dialogic AI can stimulate\nmetacognitive engagement and challenging recent narratives of de-skilling due\nto generative AI usage. These findings serve as a proof of concept for a\nbroader pedagogical shift: the use of multi-agent systems (MAS) composed of\nspecialised AI agents. To conceptualise this, we introduce the notion of\norchestrated MAS, modular, pedagogically aligned agent constellations, curated\nby educators, that support diverse learning trajectories through differentiated\nroles and coordinated interaction. To anchor this shift, we propose an adapted\noffer-and-use model, in which students appropriate instructional offers from\nthese agents.

In real-world event logs, the acquisition of data can be\nnon-trivial (e.g., due to the execution of manual activities and related manual\nrecording or to issues in collecting, for each event, all its attributes), and\noften may end up with events recorded with some missing information. Standard\napproaches to the problem of trace (or log) reconstruction either require the\navailability of a process model that is used to fill missing values by\nleveraging different reasoning techniques or employ a Machine Learning/Deep\nLearning model to restore the missing values by learning from similar cases. In\nrecent years, a new type of Deep Learning model that is capable of handling\ninput data encoded as graphs has emerged, namely Graph Neural Networks.

We evaluate our\nwork against a state-of-the-art approach leveraging autoencoders on two\nsynthetic logs and four real event logs, on different types of missing values.\nDifferent from state-of-the-art model-free approaches, which mainly focus on\nrepairing a subset of event attributes, the proposed approach shows very good\nperformance in reconstructing all different event attributes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08HGNN\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4fee\u590d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6316\u6398\u4e2d\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65e5\u5fd7\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65e5\u5fd7\u5e38\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u95ee\u9898\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u4fee\u590d\u6240\u6709\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e76\u4fee\u590d\u6240\u6709\u7f3a\u5931\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u65e5\u5fd7\u548c\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u65e5\u5fd7\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "HGNN\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fee\u590d\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65e5\u5fd7\u6240\u6709\u5c5e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, it suffers from two critical drawbacks: (1) excessive\ndecoding latency due to multi-step sampling, and (2) poor fidelity resulting\nfrom over-reliance on generative priors. To address these issues, we propose\nSODEC, a novel single-step diffusion image compression model. We argue that in\nimage compression, a sufficiently informative latent renders multi-step\nrefinement unnecessary. Based on this insight, we leverage a pre-trained\nVAE-based model to produce latents with rich information, and replace the\niterative denoising process with a single-step decoding. Meanwhile, to improve\nfidelity, we introduce the fidelity guidance module, encouraging output that is\nfaithful to the original image.

Existing learning based models rely on carefully prepared but\nlimited data, leading to significant performance degradation in\nout-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Recent foundation models have demonstrated\nexceptional robustness in monocular depth estimation through large-scale\ntraining, and using such models to enhance the robustness of depth completion\nmodels is a promising solution. In this work, we propose a novel depth\ncompletion framework that leverages depth foundation models to attain\nremarkable robustness without large-scale training. Specifically, we leverage a\ndepth foundation model to extract environmental cues, including structural and\nsemantic context, from RGB images to guide the propagation of sparse depth\ninformation into missing regions. We further design a dual-space propagation\napproach, without any learnable parameters, to effectively propagates sparse\ndepth in both 3D and 2D spaces to maintain geometric structure and local\nconsistency. To refine the intricate structure, we introduce a learnable\ncorrection module to progressively adjust the depth prediction towards the real\ndepth.

Recently, pre-trained\nvision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated promising zero-shot performance\nby leveraging semantic information to facilitate target tasks. By aligning\nvision and text embeddings, VLMs have shown notable success in bridging domain\ngaps. However, inherent differences naturally exist between modalities, which\nis known as modality gap. Our findings reveal that direct UDA with the presence\nof modality gap only transfers modality-invariant knowledge, leading to\nsuboptimal target performance. To address this limitation, we propose a unified\nmodality separation framework that accommodates both modality-specific and\nmodality-invariant components. During training, different modality components\nare disentangled from VLM features then handled separately in a unified manner.\nAt test time, modality-adaptive ensemble weights are automatically determined\nto maximize the synergy of different components. To evaluate instance-level\nmodality characteristics, we design a modality discrepancy metric to categorize\nsamples into modality-invariant, modality-specific, and uncertain ones.

This phenomenon has been attributed primarily to\nlocal recurrent interactions, rather than changes in feedforward or feedback\npathways, supported by both empirical findings and circuit-level modeling.\nRecurrent neural circuits capable of simulating these effects have been shown\nto reshape the geometry of neural manifolds, enhancing robustness and\ninvariance to irrelevant variations. In this study, we employ a Vision\nTransformer (ViT)-based autoencoder to investigate, from a functional\nperspective, how familiarity training can induce sensitivity to global context\nin the early layers of a deep neural network. We hypothesize that rapid\nlearning operates via fast weights, which encode transient or short-term memory\ntraces, and we explore the use of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to implement such\nfast weights within each Transformer layer.

ASCoT employs a modular pipeline in which an Adaptive\nVerification Manager (AVM) operates first, followed by the Multi-Perspective\nSelf-Correction Engine (MSCE). The AVM leverages a Positional Impact Score\nfunction I(k) that assigns different weights based on the position within the\nreasoning chains, addressing the Late-Stage Fragility issue by identifying and\nprioritizing high-risk, late-stage steps. Once these critical steps are\nidentified, the MSCE applies robust, dual-path correction specifically to the\nfailure parts.

This\nwould allow for much smaller storage requirements and self-sufficiency of\ndeployed systems that cope with natural distribution shifts, similarly to\nbiological learning. We focus on video CL employing a rehearsal-based approach,\nwhich reinforces past samples from a memory buffer. We posit that part of the\nreason why practical video CL is challenging is the high memory requirements of\nvideo, further exacerbated by long-videos and continual streams, which are at\nodds with the common rehearsal-buffer size constraints. To address this, we\npropose to use compressed vision, i.e. store video codes (embeddings) instead\nof raw inputs, and train a video classifier by IID sampling from this rolling\nbuffer.

Prior research has demonstrated that\ndecision-makers can be effectively assisted in such scenarios via dialogue\nagents. In line with this framing, we explore the practical challenges for\nrealizing dialog agents that can effectively assist meta-reviewers.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that MCDRL consistently\noutperforms competing methods, yielding superior segmentation accuracy and\nexhibiting robust generalizability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMCDRL\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u9ad8\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982CLIP\uff09\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "MCDRL\u5206\u4e24\u6b65\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u5229\u7528CLIP\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u80fd\u529b\u8bc6\u522b\u75c5\u53d8\u533a\u57df\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u6df7\u6dc6\u5b57\u5178\uff1b2\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u7f51\u7edc\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u53d8\u5f02\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMCDRL\u5728\u5206\u5272\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MCDRL\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0eVLM\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

We present a comprehensive theoretical and\nempirical analysis of replicability in transfer learning, introducing a\nmathematical framework that quantifies the fundamental trade-off between\nadaptation effectiveness and result consistency. Our key contribution is the\nformalization of selection sensitivity ($\\Delta_Q$), a measure that captures\nhow adaptive selection strategies respond to perturbations in training data. We\nprove that replicability failure probability: the likelihood that two\nindependent training runs produce models differing in performance by more than\na threshold, increases quadratically with selection sensitivity while\ndecreasing exponentially with sample size. Through extensive experiments on the\nMultiNLI corpus using six adaptive selection strategies - ranging from uniform\nsampling to gradient-based selection - we demonstrate that this theoretical\nrelationship holds precisely in practice. Our results reveal that highly\nadaptive strategies like gradient-based and curriculum learning achieve\nsuperior task performance but suffer from high replicability failure rates,\nwhile less adaptive approaches maintain failure rates below 7%.

Through a detailed analysis of interactions of expert German Sign\nLanguage (DGS) users with both adjustable and non-adjustable avatars in a\nspecific use case, this study identifies the key factors influencing the\ncomprehensibility, the user experience (UX), and the acceptability of such a\nsystem. Despite user preference for adjustable settings, no significant\nimprovements in UX or comprehensibility were observed, which remained at low\nlevels, amid missing SL elements (mouthings and facial expressions) and\nimplementation issues (indistinct hand shapes, lack of feedback and menu\npositioning). Hedonic quality was rated higher than pragmatic quality,\nindicating that users found the system more emotionally or aesthetically\npleasing than functionally useful. Stress levels were higher for the adjustable\navatar, reflecting lower performance, greater effort and more frustration.\nAdditionally, concerns were raised about whether the Hololens adjustment\ngestures are intuitive and easy to familiarise oneself with.

To address this issue, we propose a novel\nHierarchical and Adaptive Mixture of Biometric Experts (HAMoBE) framework,\nwhich leverages multi-layer features from a pre-trained large model (e.g.,\nCLIP) and is designed to mimic human perceptual mechanisms by independently\nmodeling key biometric features--appearance, static body shape, and dynamic\ngait--and adaptively integrating them. Specifically, HAMoBE includes two\nlevels: the first level extracts low-level features from multi-layer\nrepresentations provided by the frozen large model, while the second level\nconsists of specialized experts focusing on long-term, short-term, and temporal\nfeatures. To ensure robust matching, we introduce a new dual-input decision\ngating network that dynamically adjusts the contributions of each expert based\non their relevance to the input scenarios.

A core challenge is balancing individual learner accuracy with\ndiversity. Traditional methods like Bagging and Boosting promote diversity\nthrough randomness but lack precise control over the accuracy-diversity\ntrade-off. Negative Correlation Learning (NCL) introduces a penalty to manage\nthis trade-off but suffers from loose theoretical bounds and limited adjustment\nrange. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework called\nSelf-Error Adjustment (SEA), which decomposes ensemble errors into two distinct\ncomponents: individual performance terms, representing the self-error of each\nbase learner, and diversity terms, reflecting interactions among learners. This\ndecomposition allows us to introduce an adjustable parameter into the loss\nfunction, offering precise control over the contribution of each component,\nthus enabling finer regulation of ensemble performance. Compared to NCL and its\nvariants, SEA provides a broader range of effective adjustments and more\nconsistent changes in diversity. Furthermore, we establish tighter theoretical\nbounds for adjustable ensemble methods and validate them through empirical\nexperiments. Experimental results on several public regression and\nclassification datasets demonstrate that SEA consistently outperforms baseline\nmethods across all tasks.

However, existing CSS\nmethods typically employ single-stage encoder-decoder architectures where\nsegmentation masks and class labels are tightly coupled, leading to\ninterference between old and new class learning and suboptimal\nretention-plasticity balance.

Current methods, such as\nLLM-as-a-Judge, focus only on final outputs, overlooking the step-by-step\nreasoning that drives agentic decision-making. Meanwhile, existing\nAgent-as-a-Judge systems, where one agent evaluates another's task completion,\nare typically designed for narrow, domain-specific settings. To address this\ngap, we propose a generalizable, modular framework for evaluating agent task\ncompletion independent of the task domain. The framework emulates human-like\nevaluation by decomposing tasks into sub-tasks and validating each step using\navailable information, such as the agent's output and reasoning. Each module\ncontributes to a specific aspect of the evaluation process, and their outputs\nare aggregated to produce a final verdict on task completion.

Forward-compatible learning, which\nprospectively prepares for future tasks during base task training, has emerged\nas a promising solution for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL).\nHowever, existing methods still struggle to balance base-class discriminability\nand new-class generalization. Moreover, limited access to original data during\nincremental tasks often results in ambiguous inter-class decision boundaries.\nTo address these challenges, we propose SMP (Sculpting Margin Penalty), a novel\nFSCIL method that strategically integrates margin penalties at different stages\nwithin the parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, we introduce\nthe Margin-aware Intra-task Adapter Merging (MIAM) mechanism for base task\nlearning. MIAM trains two sets of low-rank adapters with distinct\nclassification losses: one with a margin penalty to enhance base-class\ndiscriminability, and the other without margin constraints to promote\ngeneralization to future new classes.

To\naddress this, we propose AHDMIL, an Asymmetric Hierarchical Distillation\nMulti-Instance Learning framework that enables fast and accurate classification\nby eliminating irrelevant patches through a two-step training process. AHDMIL\ncomprises two key components: the Dynamic Multi-Instance Network (DMIN), which\noperates on high-resolution WSIs, and the Dual-Branch Lightweight Instance\nPre-screening Network (DB-LIPN), which analyzes corresponding low-resolution\ncounterparts. In the first step, self-distillation (SD), DMIN is trained for\nWSI classification while generating per-instance attention scores to identify\nirrelevant patches. These scores guide the second step, asymmetric distillation\n(AD), where DB-LIPN learns to predict the relevance of each low-resolution\npatch. The relevant patches predicted by DB-LIPN have spatial correspondence\nwith patches in high-resolution WSIs, which are used for fine-tuning and\nefficient inference of DMIN.

Currently, there are two mainstream\nreward paradigms: model-based rewards and rule-based rewards. However, both\napproaches suffer from limitations: rule-based rewards lack robustness, while\nmodel-based rewards are vulnerable to reward hacking. To address these issues,\nwe propose Cooper(Co-optimizing Policy Model and Reward Model), a RL framework\nthat jointly optimizes both the policy model and the reward model. Cooper\nleverages the high precision of rule-based rewards when identifying correct\nresponses, and dynamically constructs and selects positive-negative sample\npairs for continued training the reward model. This design enhances robustness\nand mitigates the risk of reward hacking. To further support Cooper, we\nintroduce a hybrid annotation strategy that efficiently and accurately\ngenerates training data for the reward model. We also propose a reference-based\nreward modeling paradigm, where the reward model takes a reference answer as\ninput. Based on this design, we train a reward model named VerifyRM, which\nachieves higher accuracy on VerifyBench compared to other models of the same\nsize. We conduct reinforcement learning using both VerifyRM and Cooper. Our\nexperiments show that Cooper not only alleviates reward hacking but also\nimproves end-to-end RL performance, for instance, achieving a 0.54% gain in\naverage accuracy on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct.

We present OmniEAR, a\ncomprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about\nphysical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied\ntasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that provide predefined tool sets or explicit\ncollaboration directives, OmniEAR requires agents to dynamically acquire\ncapabilities and autonomously determine coordination strategies based on task\ndemands. Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous\nphysical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios\nspanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals\nsevere performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while\nachieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to\n56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound\ntasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental\ninformation degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter\ntask-relevant constraints.

This task is realized by representing the\nimage as a continuous implicit function through two fundamental modules, a\ndeep-network-based encoder and an implicit neural representation (INR) module.\nDespite achieving notable progress, a crucial challenge of such a highly\nill-posed setting is that many common geometric patterns, such as repetitive\ntextures, edges, or shapes, are seriously warped and deformed in the\nlow-resolution images, naturally leading to unexpected artifacts appearing in\ntheir high-resolution recoveries. Embedding rotation equivariance into the\nASISR network is thus necessary, as it has been widely demonstrated that this\nenhancement enables the recovery to faithfully maintain the original\norientations and structural integrity of geometric patterns underlying the\ninput image. Motivated by this, we make efforts to construct a rotation\nequivariant ASISR method in this study. Specifically, we elaborately redesign\nthe basic architectures of INR and encoder modules, incorporating intrinsic\nrotation equivariance capabilities beyond those of conventional ASISR networks.\nThrough such amelioration, the ASISR network can, for the first time, be\nimplemented with end-to-end rotational equivariance maintained from input to\noutput. We also provide a solid theoretical analysis to evaluate its intrinsic\nequivariance error, demonstrating its inherent nature of embedding such an\nequivariance structure.

This method minimizes the\ndiscrepancy between token representations in LMMs with and without pruning,\nthereby enabling superior pruning strategies tailored to different LMMs.\nExperiments demonstrate that VFlowOpt can prune 90% of visual tokens while\nmaintaining comparable performance, leading to an 89% reduction in KV-Cache\nmemory and 3.8 times faster inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "VFlowOpt\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u56fe\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u526a\u679d\u6a21\u5757\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff08LMMs\uff09\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u5197\u4f59\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u71b5\u751f\u6210\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u56fe\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u526a\u679d\u548c\u56de\u6536\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u4f18\u5316\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u526a\u679d90%\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u8fd1\uff0cKV-Cache\u5185\u5b58\u51cf\u5c1189%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53473.8\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "VFlowOpt\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540cLMMs\u3002"}}

However, its performance significantly degrades when\ndomain discrepancies exist between training and deployment. Cross-Domain\nFew-Shot Segmentation(CD-FSS) is proposed to mitigate such performance\ndegradation. Current CD-FSS methods primarily sought to develop segmentation\nmodels on a source domain capable of cross-domain generalization. However,\ndriven by escalating concerns over data privacy and the imperative to minimize\ndata transfer and training expenses, the development of source-free CD-FSS\napproaches has become essential.

Recently, some\nresearchers have explored using text generation to adapt to the variations in\nthe target during tracking, however, these works fail to provide insights into\nthe model's reasoning process and do not fully leverage the advantages of large\nmodels, which further limits their overall performance. To address the\naforementioned issues, this paper proposes a novel reasoning-based\nvision-language tracking framework, named ReasoningTrack, based on a\npre-trained vision-language model Qwen2.5-VL.

Building upon this,\nCVC-SSL adopts a self-supervised training paradigm where the model reconstructs\nthe original camera views from the synthesized stitched images using a\ndiffusion model, enforcing cross-view consistency without requiring supervision\nfrom extrapolated data.

To address these issues, this paper proposes\nSGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model\n(SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core\nof our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as\nexplicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a\nconditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a\ntwo-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal\nfeatures, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the\npreliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's\ncoarse-to-fine denoising generation.

Propensity score-based weighting methods are widely used to\naddress this issue by reweighting samples to simulate a randomized controlled\ntrial (RCT). However, the effectiveness of these methods heavily depends on the\nobserved data and the accuracy of the propensity score estimator. For example,\ninverse propensity weighting (IPW) assigns weights based on the inverse of the\npropensity score, which can lead to instable weights when propensity scores\nhave high variance-either due to data or model misspecification-ultimately\ndegrading the ability of handling selection bias and treatment effect\nestimation. To overcome these limitations, we propose Deconfounding Factor\nWeighting (DFW), a novel propensity score-based approach that leverages the\ndeconfounding factor-to construct stable and effective sample weights. DFW\nprioritizes less confounded samples while mitigating the influence of highly\nconfounded ones, producing a pseudopopulation that better approximates a RCT.\nOur approach ensures bounded weights, lower variance, and improved covariate\nbalance.While DFW is formulated for binary treatments, it naturally extends to\nmulti-treatment settings, as the deconfounding factor is computed based on the\nestimated probability of the treatment actually received by each sample.\nThrough extensive experiments on real-world benchmark and synthetic datasets,\nwe demonstrate that DFW outperforms existing methods, including IPW and CBPS,\nin both covariate balancing and treatment effect estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u503e\u5411\u5f97\u5206\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5DFW\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u89c2\u5bdf\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u6df7\u6dc6\u56e0\u5b50\u6784\u5efa\u7a33\u5b9a\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c2\u5bdf\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u503e\u5411\u5f97\u5206\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982IPW\uff09\u56e0\u6743\u91cd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u800c\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDeconfounding Factor Weighting (DFW)\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53bb\u6df7\u6dc6\u56e0\u5b50\u6784\u5efa\u7a33\u5b9a\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u5904\u7406\u4f4e\u6df7\u6dc6\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u968f\u673a\u5bf9\u7167\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7684\u4f2a\u7fa4\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDFW\u5728\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eIPW\u548cCBPS\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DFW\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u6df7\u6dc6\u56e0\u5b50\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u503e\u5411\u5f97\u5206\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e8c\u5143\u548c\u591a\u6cbb\u7597\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Despite the remarkable progress of\ndeep learning in recent years, most existing methods still rely on\nspatial-domain modeling, where the limited diversity of feature representations\nhinders the detection of subtle change regions. We observe that\nfrequency-domain feature modeling particularly in the wavelet domain an amplify\nfine-grained differences in frequency components, enhancing the perception of\nedge changes that are challenging to capture in the spatial domain. Thus, we\npropose a method called Wavelet-Guided Dual-Frequency Encoding (WGDF).\nSpecifically, we first apply Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decompose the\ninput images into high-frequency and low-frequency components, which are used\nto model local details and global structures, respectively. In the\nhigh-frequency branch, we design a Dual-Frequency Feature Enhancement (DFFE)\nmodule to strengthen edge detail representation and introduce a\nFrequency-Domain Interactive Difference (FDID) module to enhance the modeling\nof fine-grained changes. In the low-frequency branch, we exploit Transformers\nto capture global semantic relationships and employ a Progressive Contextual\nDifference Module (PCDM) to progressively refine change regions, enabling\nprecise structural semantic characterization.

However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains\nchallenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to\nsupport reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited\ncapacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories\ncaused by fragmented architectures.\n  To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought\nframework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a\nsingle unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image\nunderstanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving\nvisual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is\nnon-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To\naddress this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A\nMacro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask\nexecution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead.\nFurthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines\ninterleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task\nobjectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to\nperform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our\ndesign, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs\nwith 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation\nbenchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT\ndemonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT\nas a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning.

In addition, a\ndual-stage retrieval strategy equipped with a question-aware multimodal\nretriever is introduced to improve retrieval efficiency while refining\nprecision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for\nknowledge-based VQA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff08mKG-RAG\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u5f15\u5165\u65e0\u5173\u6216\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff08KGs\uff09\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u63d0\u53d6\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53/\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u591a\u6a21\u6001KGs\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "mKG-RAG\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Existing time\nseries foundation models (TSFMs), often based on transformer variants, struggle\nwith generalization across varying context and target lengths, lack\nadaptability to different sampling rates, and are computationally inefficient.\nWe introduce FlowState, a novel TSFM architecture that addresses these\nchallenges through two key innovations: a state space model (SSM) based encoder\nand a functional basis decoder. This design enables continuous-time modeling\nand dynamic time-scale adjustment, allowing FlowState to inherently generalize\nacross all possible temporal resolutions, and dynamically adjust the\nforecasting horizons. In contrast to other state-of-the-art TSFMs, which\nrequire training data across all possible sampling rates to memorize patterns\nat each scale, FlowState inherently adapts its internal dynamics to the input\nscale, enabling smaller models, reduced data requirements, and improved\nefficiency.

To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Gabor\nSplatting (3DGabSplat) that leverages a novel 3D Gabor-based primitive with\nmultiple directional 3D frequency responses for radiance field representation\nsupervised by multi-view images. The proposed 3D Gabor-based primitive forms a\nfilter bank incorporating multiple 3D Gabor kernels at different frequencies to\nenhance flexibility and efficiency in capturing fine 3D details. Furthermore,\nto achieve novel view rendering, an efficient CUDA-based rasterizer is\ndeveloped to project the multiple directional 3D frequency components\ncharacterized by 3D Gabor-based primitives onto the 2D image plane, and a\nfrequency-adaptive mechanism is presented for adaptive joint optimization of\nprimitives. 3DGabSplat is scalable to be a plug-and-play kernel for seamless\nintegration into existing 3DGS paradigms to enhance both efficiency and quality\nof novel view synthesis.

A critical yet\nunderexplored aspect of this task is the effective use of patient-specific\nprior knowledge -- including clinical context (e.g., symptoms, medical history)\nand the most recent prior image -- which radiologists routinely rely on for\ndiagnostic reasoning. Most existing methods generate reports from single\nimages, neglecting this essential prior information and thus failing to capture\ndiagnostic intent or disease progression. To bridge this gap, we propose\nPriorRG, a novel chest X-ray report generation framework that emulates\nreal-world clinical workflows via a two-stage training pipeline. In Stage 1, we\nintroduce a prior-guided contrastive pre-training scheme that leverages\nclinical context to guide spatiotemporal feature extraction, allowing the model\nto align more closely with the intrinsic spatiotemporal semantics in radiology\nreports. In Stage 2, we present a prior-aware coarse-to-fine decoding for\nreport generation that progressively integrates patient-specific prior\nknowledge with the vision encoder's hidden states. This decoding allows the\nmodel to align with diagnostic focus and track disease progression, thereby\nenhancing the clinical accuracy and fluency of the generated reports.

However, most CVL methods\noutput only a single observation, the camera pose, and lack the redundant\nobservations required by surveying principles, making it challenging to assess\nlocalization reliability through the mutual validation of observational data.\nTo tackle this, we introduce Slice-Loc, a two-stage method featuring an\na-contrario reliability validation for CVL. Instead of using the query image as\na single input, Slice-Loc divides it into sub-images and estimates the 3-DoF\npose for each slice, creating redundant and independent observations. Then, a\ngeometric rigidity formula is proposed to filter out the erroneous 3-DoF poses,\nand the inliers are merged to generate the final camera pose. Furthermore, we\npropose a model that quantifies the meaningfulness of localization by\nestimating the number of false alarms (NFA), according to the distribution of\nthe locations of the sliced images. By eliminating gross errors, Slice-Loc\nboosts localization accuracy and effectively detects failures. After filtering\nout mislocalizations, Slice-Loc reduces the proportion of errors exceeding 10 m\nto under 3\\%. In cross-city tests on the DReSS dataset, Slice-Loc cuts the mean\nlocalization error from 4.47 m to 1.86 m and the mean orientation error from\n$\\mathbf{3.42^{\\circ}}$ to $\\mathbf{1.24^{\\circ}}$, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art methods.

While mainstream\napproaches often adopt Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), they struggle to\ncapture the spatial dependencies among tissue structures. Graph Neural Networks\n(GNNs) have emerged as a solution to model inter-instance relationships, yet\nmost rely on static graph topologies and overlook the physical spatial\npositions of tissue patches. Moreover, conventional attention mechanisms lack\nspecificity, limiting their ability to focus on structurally relevant regions.\nIn this work, we propose a novel GNN framework with deformable attention for\npathology image analysis. We construct a dynamic weighted directed graph based\non patch features, where each node aggregates contextual information from its\nneighbors via attention-weighted edges.

Latent bandits\noffer substantially reduced exploration times for such problems, given that the\njoint distribution of a latent state and the rewards of actions is known and\naccurate. In practice, finding such a model is non-trivial, and there may not\nexist a small number of latent states that explain the responses of all\nindividuals.

Experimental results demonstrate\nthat F2PASeg consistently segments critical anatomical structures in real time,\nproviding a reliable solution for intraoperative pituitary surgery planning.\nCode: https://github.com/paulili08/F2PASeg.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5782\u4f53\u89e3\u5256\u5206\u5272\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08PAS\uff09\u548cF2PASeg\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u5206\u5272\u5173\u952e\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5782\u4f53\u624b\u672f\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5782\u4f53\u80bf\u7624\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u90bb\u8fd1\u91cd\u8981\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u6216\u5305\u88f9\uff0c\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u5272\u53ef\u4e3a\u5916\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u63d0\u4f9b\u65e9\u671f\u98ce\u9669\u533a\u57df\u9884\u8b66\uff0c\u4f46\u76f8\u5173\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7a00\u7f3a\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u89e3\u51b3\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faF2PASeg\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u672f\u4e2d\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eF2PASeg\u80fd\u5b9e\u65f6\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u5206\u5272\u5173\u952e\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e3a\u672f\u4e2d\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "PAS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cF2PASeg\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u5782\u4f53\u624b\u672f\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Experiments on non-IID benchmarks show that CR-FMOL enhances client\nfairness, and although the early-stage performance is slightly inferior to\nFedAvg, it is expected to achieve comparable accuracy given sufficient training\nrounds.", "AI": {"tldr": "CR-FMOL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u504f\u597d\u9525\u7ea6\u675f\u786e\u4fdd\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfFedAvg\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3FedAvg\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5ffd\u89c6\u5c11\u6570\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9525\u7ea6\u675f\u7684Pareto-MTL\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408FMGDA/FSMGDA\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5ba2\u6237\u7aefPareto\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u521d\u671f\u6027\u80fd\u7565\u4f4e\u4e8eFedAvg\uff0c\u4f46\u540e\u671f\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u76f8\u8fd1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "CR-FMOL\u4e3a\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Survival\nanalysis, the quantitative framework used to model time-to-event data, accounts\nfor patients who do not experience the event of interest during the study\nperiod, known as censored patients. However, many patients experience events\nthat prevent the observation of the outcome of interest. These competing risks\nare often treated as censoring, a practice frequently overlooked due to a\nlimited understanding of its consequences. Our work theoretically demonstrates\nwhy treating competing risks as censoring introduces substantial bias in\nsurvival estimates, leading to systematic overestimation of risk and,\ncritically, amplifying disparities. First, we formalize the problem of\nmisclassifying competing risks as censoring and quantify the resulting error in\nsurvival estimates.

When multiple pedestrians interact or overlap, the loss\nof target features severely compromises the tracker's ability to maintain\nstable trajectories. Traditional tracking methods, which typically rely on\nfull-body bounding box features extracted from {Re-ID} models and linear\nconstant-velocity motion assumptions, often struggle in severe occlusion\nscenarios. To address these limitations, this work proposes an enhanced\ntracking framework that leverages richer feature representations and a more\nrobust motion model.

To further mitigate occlusion challenges, a head\nkeypoint detection model is introduced, as the head is less prone to occlusion\ncompared to the full body.

This\nscenario is particularly relevant in domains like neuroscience, where\nwell-defined behaviors (e.g., walking, eating) coexist with subtle or\ninfrequent actions that are often overlooked, as well as in applications where\ndatasets are inherently partially annotated due to ambiguous or missing labels.\nTo address this problem, we propose a two-step approach that leverages the\nknown annotations to guide both the temporal and semantic granularity of\nunknown action segments.

While Vision-Language\nPre-training (VLP) models offer a strong open-vocabulary foundation, they often\nstruggle with fine-grained localization under weak supervision and typically\nfail to explicitly leverage structured relational knowledge beyond basic\nsemantics, limiting performance especially for unseen classes. To overcome\nthese limitations, we propose the Dual Adaptive Refinement Transfer (DART)\nframework. DART enhances a frozen VLP backbone via two synergistic adaptive\nmodules. For intra-class refinement, an Adaptive Refinement Module (ARM)\nrefines patch features adaptively, coupled with a novel Weakly Supervised Patch\nSelecting (WPS) loss that enables discriminative localization using only\nimage-level labels.

However, the\nexisting tokenizers often face unsatisfactory trade-off between compression\nratios and reconstruction fidelity. To fill this gap, we introduce a powerful\nand concise WeTok tokenizer, which surpasses the previous leading tokenizers\nvia two core innovations. (1) Group-wise lookup-free Quantization (GQ). We\npartition the latent features into groups, and perform lookup-free quantization\nfor each group. As a result, GQ can efficiently overcome memory and computation\nlimitations of prior tokenizers, while achieving a reconstruction breakthrough\nwith more scalable codebooks. (2) Generative Decoding (GD). Different from\nprior tokenizers, we introduce a generative decoder with a prior of extra noise\nvariable. In this case, GD can probabilistically model the distribution of\nvisual data conditioned on discrete tokens, allowing WeTok to reconstruct\nvisual details, especially at high compression ratios. Extensive experiments on\nmainstream benchmarks show superior performance of our WeTok. On the ImageNet\n50k validation set, WeTok achieves a record-low zero-shot rFID (WeTok: 0.12 vs.\nFLUX-VAE: 0.18 vs. SD-VAE 3.5: 0.19).

Additionally, we extend texture evaluation beyond aesthetic\nappearance by explicitly assessing material realism, focusing on attributes\nsuch as albedo, saturation, and metallicness. 2) To support this framework, we\nconstruct Hi3DBench, a large-scale dataset comprising diverse 3D assets and\nhigh-quality annotations, accompanied by a reliable multi-agent annotation\npipeline. We further propose a 3D-aware automated scoring system based on\nhybrid 3D representations. Specifically, we leverage video-based\nrepresentations for object-level and material-subject evaluations to enhance\nmodeling of spatio-temporal consistency and employ pretrained 3D features for\npart-level perception. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach\noutperforms existing image-based metrics in modeling 3D characteristics and\nachieves superior alignment with human preference, providing a scalable\nalternative to manual evaluations.

Although state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive\nperformance (e.g., 90+% J&F) on existing benchmarks such as DAVIS and\nYouTube-VOS, these datasets primarily contain salient, dominant, and isolated\nobjects, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. To advance VOS\ntoward more realistic environments, coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1)\nwas introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes. Building on the\nstrengths and limitations of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, a significantly more\nchallenging dataset designed to further advance VOS methods under real-world\nconditions. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and over 701,976 high-quality masks\nfor 10,074 objects across 200 categories. Compared to its predecessor, MOSEv2\nintroduces significantly greater scene complexity, including more frequent\nobject disappearance and reappearance, severe occlusions and crowding, smaller\nobjects, as well as a range of new challenges such as adverse weather (e.g.,\nrain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot\nsequences, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows,\nreflections), scenarios requiring external knowledge, etc. We benchmark 20\nrepresentative VOS methods under 5 different settings and observe consistent\nperformance drops.

Project page: https://weiqi-zhang.github.io/GAP", "summary": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its advantages in achieving\nfast and high-quality rendering. As point clouds serve as a widely-used and\neasily accessible form of 3D representation, bridging the gap between point\nclouds and Gaussians becomes increasingly important. Recent studies have\nexplored how to convert the colored points into Gaussians, but directly\ngenerating Gaussians from colorless 3D point clouds remains an unsolved\nchallenge. In this paper, we propose GAP, a novel approach that gaussianizes\nraw point clouds into high-fidelity 3D Gaussians with text guidance. Our key\nidea is to design a multi-view optimization framework that leverages a\ndepth-aware image diffusion model to synthesize consistent appearances across\ndifferent viewpoints. To ensure geometric accuracy, we introduce a\nsurface-anchoring mechanism that effectively constrains Gaussians to lie on the\nsurfaces of 3D shapes during optimization. Furthermore, GAP incorporates a\ndiffuse-based inpainting strategy that specifically targets at completing\nhard-to-observe regions. We evaluate GAP on the Point-to-Gaussian generation\ntask across varying complexity levels, from synthetic point clouds to\nchallenging real-world scans, and even large-scale scenes.
