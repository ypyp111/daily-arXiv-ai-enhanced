We first show that the inverse of the efficiency provides an upper bound\nfor the dimensionless energy injection in a turbulent flow. We analyse the\nefficiency of turbulence for different flows using numerical and experimental\ndata. Our analysis suggests that efficiency is bounded from above, and, in some\ncases, saturates following a power law reminiscent of phase transitions and\nbifurcations. We show that for the von K{\\'a}rm{\\'a}n flow the efficiency\nsaturation is insensitive to the details of the forcing impellers. In the case\nof Rayleigh-B{\\'e}nard convection, we show that within the Grossman and Lohse\nmodel, the efficiency saturates in the inviscid limit, while the dimensionless\nkinetic energy injection/dissipation goes to zero. In the case of pipe flow, we\nshow that saturation of the efficiency cannot be excluded, but would be\nincompatible with the Prandtl law of the drag friction coefficient.\nFurthermore, if the power law behaviour holds for the efficiency saturation, it\ncan explain the kinetic energy and the energy dissipation defect laws proposed\nfor the shear flows. Efficiency saturation is an interesting empirical property\nof turbulence that may help in evaluating the ''closeness'' of experimental and\nnumerical data to the true turbulent regime, wherein the kinetic energy\nsaturates to its inviscid limit."}

To address this gap, we investigate multi-column\nroughness configurations that serve as a regularized analog of roughness\nclustering. Using large-eddy simulations, we systematically examine the effects\nof cluster density and local arrangement on secondary flows, and observe that\nvarying the cluster density gives rise to distinct secondary flow polarities.\nThrough a systematic parameter study, we identify the spanwise gap between the\nedge-most roughness elements of adjacent columns, normalized by the channel\nhalf-height, as a key geometric factor governing this polarity. In addition to\nanalyzing the time-averaged structure, we investigate how variations in\npolarity affect the instantaneous dynamics of secondary flows. Here, we find\nthat the regions of high- and low-momentum fluid created by the secondary flows\nalternate in a chaotic, non-periodic manner over time.

Transfer-based\nattacks create adversarial examples for surrogate models and transfer these\nexamples to target models under black-box scenarios. Recent studies reveal that\nadversarial examples in flat loss landscapes exhibit superior transferability\nto alleviate overfitting on surrogate models. However, the prior arts overlook\nthe influence of perturbation directions, resulting in limited transferability.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel attack method, named Residual Perturbation\nAttack (ResPA), relying on the residual gradient as the perturbation direction\nto guide the adversarial examples toward the flat regions of the loss function.\nSpecifically, ResPA conducts an exponential moving average on the input\ngradients to obtain the first moment as the reference gradient, which\nencompasses the direction of historical gradients. Instead of heavily relying\non the local flatness that stems from the current gradients as the perturbation\ndirection, ResPA further considers the residual between the current gradient\nand the reference gradient to capture the changes in the global perturbation\ndirection. The experimental results demonstrate the better transferability of\nResPA than the existing typical transfer-based attack methods, while the\ntransferability can be further improved by combining ResPA with the current\ninput transformation methods.

By integrating\nphysics-driven light-interaction modeling and a differentiable rendering-based\nreprojection strategy, our framework directly converts 3D geometric errors into\nnormal optimization signals, solving the challenges of multi-view geometric\ninconsistency and data dependency.

GFed-PP incorporates the interaction data\nof public users to build a user-item interaction graph, which is then used to\nform a user relationship graph. A lightweight graph convolutional network (GCN)\nis employed to learn each user's user-specific personalized item embedding. To\nprotect user privacy, each client learns the user embedding and the scoring\nfunction locally. Additionally, GFed-PP achieves optimization of the federated\nrecommendation framework through the initialization of item embedding on\nclients and the aggregation of the user relationship graph on the server.\nExperimental results demonstrate that GFed-PP significantly outperforms\nexisting methods for five datasets, offering superior recommendation accuracy\nwithout compromising privacy.

In total, the dataset comprises 2,400 human-written and 24,000\nLLM-generated answers, supported by over 132,000 human annotations.\nExperimental results show that top-performing LLMs surpass human fans in\nrole-playing and emotional support, while humans still lead in response\ndiversity.

Current mainstream VQA methods typically improve\nperformance by pretraining on large-scale classification datasets (e.g.,\nImageNet, Kinetics-400), followed by fine-tuning on VQA datasets. However, this\nstrategy presents two significant challenges: (1) merely transferring semantic\nknowledge learned from pretraining is insufficient for VQA, as video quality\ndepends on multiple factors (e.g., semantics, distortion, motion, aesthetics);\n(2) pretraining on large-scale datasets demands enormous computational\nresources, often dozens or even hundreds of times greater than training\ndirectly on VQA datasets.

Transfer-based\nattacks create adversarial examples for surrogate models and transfer these\nexamples to target models under black-box scenarios. Recent studies reveal that\nadversarial examples in flat loss landscapes exhibit superior transferability\nto alleviate overfitting on surrogate models. However, the prior arts overlook\nthe influence of perturbation directions, resulting in limited transferability.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel attack method, named Residual Perturbation\nAttack (ResPA), relying on the residual gradient as the perturbation direction\nto guide the adversarial examples toward the flat regions of the loss function.\nSpecifically, ResPA conducts an exponential moving average on the input\ngradients to obtain the first moment as the reference gradient, which\nencompasses the direction of historical gradients. Instead of heavily relying\non the local flatness that stems from the current gradients as the perturbation\ndirection, ResPA further considers the residual between the current gradient\nand the reference gradient to capture the changes in the global perturbation\ndirection. The experimental results demonstrate the better transferability of\nResPA than the existing typical transfer-based attack methods, while the\ntransferability can be further improved by combining ResPA with the current\ninput transformation methods.

This paper investigates a critical question for compute-optimal\ndiffusion model deployment: Under a post-training setting without fine-tuning,\nis it more effective to reduce the number of denoising steps or to use a\ncheaper per-step inference? Intuitively, reducing the number of denoising steps\nincreases the variability of the distributions across steps, making the model\nmore sensitive to compression. In contrast, keeping more denoising steps makes\nthe differences smaller, preserving redundancy, and making post-training\ncompression more feasible. To systematically examine this, we propose PostDiff,\na training-free framework for accelerating pre-trained diffusion models by\nreducing redundancy at both the input level and module level in a post-training\nmanner. At the input level, we propose a mixed-resolution denoising scheme\nbased on the insight that reducing generation resolution in early denoising\nsteps can enhance low-frequency components and improve final generation\nfidelity. At the module level, we employ a hybrid module caching strategy to\nreuse computations across denoising steps. Extensive experiments and ablation\nstudies demonstrate that (1) PostDiff can significantly improve the\nfidelity-efficiency trade-off of state-of-the-art diffusion models, and (2) to\nboost efficiency while maintaining decent generation fidelity, reducing\nper-step inference cost is often more effective than reducing the number of\ndenoising steps.

Existing studies typically induce such\ndeception by explicitly setting a \"hidden\" objective through prompting or\nfine-tuning, which may not fully reflect real-world human-LLM interactions.\nMoving beyond this human-induced deception, we investigate LLMs' self-initiated\ndeception on benign prompts.

Although\nstate-of-the-art models perform well on simple anomalies (e.g., explosions),\nthey struggle with complex real-world events (e.g., shoplifting). This\ndifficulty stems from two key issues: (1) the inability of current models to\naddress the diversity of anomaly types, as they process all categories with a\nshared model, overlooking category-specific features; and (2) the weak\nsupervision signal, which lacks precise temporal information, limiting the\nability to capture nuanced anomalous patterns blended with normal events.

Wisdom from the Same-Identity Crowd", "comment": null, "summary": "A central problem in one-to-many facial identification is that the person in\nthe probe image may or may not have enrolled image(s) in the gallery; that is,\nmay be In-gallery or Out-of-gallery. Past approaches to detect when a rank-one\nresult is Out-of-gallery have mostly focused on finding a suitable threshold on\nthe similarity score. We take a new approach, using the additional enrolled\nimages of the identity with the rank-one result to predict if the rank-one\nresult is In-gallery / Out-of-gallery. Given a gallery of identities and\nimages, we generate In-gallery and Out-of-gallery training data by extracting\nthe ranks of additional enrolled images corresponding to the rank-one identity.\nWe then train a classifier to utilize this feature vector to predict whether a\nrank-one result is In-gallery or Out-of-gallery. Using two different datasets\nand four different matchers, we present experimental results showing that our\napproach is viable for mugshot quality probe images, and also, importantly, for\nprobes degraded by blur, reduced resolution, atmospheric turbulence and\nsunglasses. We also analyze results across demographic groups, and show that\nIn-gallery / Out-of-gallery classification accuracy is similar across\ndemographics. Our approach has the potential to provide an objective estimate\nof whether a one-to-many facial identification is Out-of-gallery, and thereby\nto reduce false positive identifications, wrongful arrests, and wasted\ninvestigative time. Interestingly, comparing the results of older deep\nCNN-based face matchers with newer ones suggests that the effectiveness of our\nOut-of-gallery detection approach emerges only with matchers trained using\nadvanced margin-based loss functions."}

To address these\nchallenges, this study proposed a novel approach to enhance diagnostic accuracy\nby synthesizing realistic oral cancer lesions using an inpainting technique\nwith a fine-tuned diffusion model. We compiled a comprehensive dataset from\nmultiple sources, featuring a variety of oral cancer images. Our method\ngenerated synthetic lesions that exhibit a high degree of visual fidelity to\nactual lesions, thereby significantly enhancing the performance of diagnostic\nalgorithms. The results show that our classification model achieved a\ndiagnostic accuracy of 0.97 in differentiating between cancerous and\nnon-cancerous tissues, while our detection model accurately identified lesion\nlocations with 0.85 accuracy. This method validates the potential for synthetic\nimage generation in medical diagnostics and paves the way for further research\ninto extending these methods to other types of cancer diagnostics."}

However, learning\nto map neural fields often requires large amounts of training data and\ncomputations, which can be limited to resource-constrained edge devices. One\napproach to tackle this limitation is to leverage Federated Meta-Learning\n(FML), but traditional FML approaches suffer from privacy leakage. To address\nthese issues, we introduce a novel FML approach called FedMeNF. FedMeNF\nutilizes a new privacy-preserving loss function that regulates privacy leakage\nin the local meta-optimization. This enables the local meta-learner to optimize\nquickly and efficiently without retaining the client's private data. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that FedMeNF achieves fast optimization speed and\nrobust reconstruction performance, even with few-shot or non-IID data across\ndiverse data modalities, while preserving client data privacy."}
