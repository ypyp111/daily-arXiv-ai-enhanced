### [1] [Boosting Adversarial Transferability via Residual Perturbation Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05689)
*Jinjia Peng,Zeze Tao,Huibing Wang,Meng Wang,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ResPA的新型攻击方法，通过利用残差梯度作为扰动方向，提升对抗样本在目标模型中的可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了扰动方向的影响，导致对抗样本的可迁移性受限。

Method: ResPA通过指数移动平均获取参考梯度，并利用当前梯度与参考梯度的残差来捕捉全局扰动方向的变化。

Result: 实验表明，ResPA的可迁移性优于现有典型迁移攻击方法，且与输入变换方法结合后效果更佳。

Conclusion: ResPA通过优化扰动方向，显著提升了对抗样本的可迁移性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial examples while suffering
from incorrect predictions via imperceptible perturbations. Transfer-based
attacks create adversarial examples for surrogate models and transfer these
examples to target models under black-box scenarios. Recent studies reveal that
adversarial examples in flat loss landscapes exhibit superior transferability
to alleviate overfitting on surrogate models. However, the prior arts overlook
the influence of perturbation directions, resulting in limited transferability.
In this paper, we propose a novel attack method, named Residual Perturbation
Attack (ResPA), relying on the residual gradient as the perturbation direction
to guide the adversarial examples toward the flat regions of the loss function.
Specifically, ResPA conducts an exponential moving average on the input
gradients to obtain the first moment as the reference gradient, which
encompasses the direction of historical gradients. Instead of heavily relying
on the local flatness that stems from the current gradients as the perturbation
direction, ResPA further considers the residual between the current gradient
and the reference gradient to capture the changes in the global perturbation
direction. The experimental results demonstrate the better transferability of
ResPA than the existing typical transfer-based attack methods, while the
transferability can be further improved by combining ResPA with the current
input transformation methods. The code is available at

### [2] [Generalized Few-Shot Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05732)
*Pinxuan Li,Bing Cao,Changqing Zhang,Qinghua Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种广义少样本OOD检测框架（GOOD），通过引入通用知识模型（GKM）和知识动态嵌入（KDE）机制，提升模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本OOD检测方法在开放世界中的泛化能力不足，容易过拟合，导致性能下降和不一致。

Method: 提出GOOD框架，利用GKM增强通用知识，并通过KDE机制动态调整通用知识的引导。

Result: 实验证明该方法在真实OOD基准测试中表现优越。

Conclusion: GOOD框架通过GS平衡和KDE机制有效提升了少样本OOD检测的泛化能力。

Abstract: Few-shot Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection has emerged as a critical
research direction in machine learning for practical deployment. Most existing
Few-shot OOD detection methods suffer from insufficient generalization
capability for the open world. Due to the few-shot learning paradigm, the OOD
detection ability is often overfit to the limited training data itself, thus
degrading the performance on generalized data and performing inconsistently
across different scenarios. To address this challenge, we proposed a
Generalized Few-shot OOD Detection (GOOD) framework, which empowers the general
knowledge of the OOD detection model with an auxiliary General Knowledge Model
(GKM), instead of directly learning from few-shot data. We proceed to reveal
the few-shot OOD detection from a generalization perspective and theoretically
derive the Generality-Specificity balance (GS-balance) for OOD detection, which
provably reduces the upper bound of generalization error with a general
knowledge model. Accordingly, we propose a Knowledge Dynamic Embedding (KDE)
mechanism to adaptively modulate the guidance of general knowledge. KDE
dynamically aligns the output distributions of the OOD detection model to the
general knowledge model based on the Generalized Belief (G-Belief) of GKM,
thereby boosting the GS-balance. Experiments on real-world OOD benchmarks
demonstrate our superiority. Codes will be available.

### [3] [UnGuide: Learning to Forget with LoRA-Guided Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05755)
*Agnieszka Polowczyk,Alicja Polowczyk,Dawid Malarz,Artur Kasymov,Marcin Mazur,Jacek Tabor,Przemysław Spurek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UnGuide是一种新方法，通过动态推理机制UnGuidance，结合LoRA适配器，实现对扩散模型中特定概念的精确移除，同时保持其他内容的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模文本到图像扩散模型可能被滥用于生成有害或误导性内容，因此需要有效的机器遗忘方法，移除特定知识而不影响整体性能。

Method: UnGuide利用Classifier-Free Guidance（CFG）动态调整引导尺度，结合LoRA适配器，选择性移除目标概念。对于无关提示，基础模型主导生成以保持内容保真度。

Result: 实验表明，UnGuide在概念移除任务中优于现有LoRA方法，同时保留了扩散模型的表达能力。

Conclusion: UnGuide通过动态控制实现了高效且精确的机器遗忘，为扩散模型的安全应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have heightened
concerns about their potential misuse, especially in generating harmful or
misleading content. This underscores the urgent need for effective machine
unlearning, i.e., removing specific knowledge or concepts from pretrained
models without compromising overall performance. One possible approach is
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which offers an efficient means to fine-tune models
for targeted unlearning. However, LoRA often inadvertently alters unrelated
content, leading to diminished image fidelity and realism. To address this
limitation, we introduce UnGuide -- a novel approach which incorporates
UnGuidance, a dynamic inference mechanism that leverages Classifier-Free
Guidance (CFG) to exert precise control over the unlearning process. UnGuide
modulates the guidance scale based on the stability of a few first steps of
denoising processes, enabling selective unlearning by LoRA adapter. For prompts
containing the erased concept, the LoRA module predominates and is
counterbalanced by the base model; for unrelated prompts, the base model
governs generation, preserving content fidelity. Empirical results demonstrate
that UnGuide achieves controlled concept removal and retains the expressive
power of diffusion models, outperforming existing LoRA-based methods in both
object erasure and explicit content removal tasks.

### [4] [Improving Masked Style Transfer using Blended Partial Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05769)
*Seyed Hadi Seyed,Ayberk Cansever,David Hart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于部分卷积的风格迁移网络，专注于对图像中特定区域进行精确风格迁移，解决了传统方法在区域风格化中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通常对整个图像进行风格迁移，而用户可能仅需对特定区域进行风格化。传统掩码方法无法准确捕捉目标区域的风格特征。

Method: 采用部分卷积风格迁移网络，结合网络内部混合技术，以解决区域选择不完美的问题。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视觉和定量上均优于传统方法，使用了SA-1B数据集进行验证。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了区域风格化的准确性和视觉效果，代码已公开。

Abstract: Artistic style transfer has long been possible with the advancements of
convolution- and transformer-based neural networks. Most algorithms apply the
artistic style transfer to the whole image, but individual users may only need
to apply a style transfer to a specific region in the image. The standard
practice is to simply mask the image after the stylization. This work shows
that this approach tends to improperly capture the style features in the region
of interest. We propose a partial-convolution-based style transfer network that
accurately applies the style features exclusively to the region of interest.
Additionally, we present network-internal blending techniques that account for
imperfections in the region selection. We show that this visually and
quantitatively improves stylization using examples from the SA-1B dataset. Code
is publicly available at https://github.com/davidmhart/StyleTransferMasked.

### [5] [MAISI-v2: Accelerated 3D High-Resolution Medical Image Synthesis with Rectified Flow and Region-specific Contrastive Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05772)
*Can Zhao,Pengfei Guo,Dong Yang,Yucheng Tang,Yufan He,Benjamin Simon,Mason Belue,Stephanie Harmon,Baris Turkbey,Daguang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAISI-v2是一个加速的3D医学图像合成框架，通过整合rectified flow实现快速高质量生成，并引入区域特异性对比损失提升条件一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有扩散模型在医学图像合成中的通用性差、推理速度慢和输入条件对齐弱的问题。

Method: 整合rectified flow加速生成，引入区域特异性对比损失增强条件一致性。

Result: MAISI-v2实现了33倍加速的潜在扩散模型，并达到SOTA图像质量，下游分割实验验证了合成图像的数据增强效果。

Conclusion: MAISI-v2为医学图像合成提供了高效且高质量的解决方案，并开源代码和模型以促进社区发展。

Abstract: Medical image synthesis is an important topic for both clinical and research
applications. Recently, diffusion models have become a leading approach in this
area. Despite their strengths, many existing methods struggle with (1) limited
generalizability that only work for specific body regions or voxel spacings,
(2) slow inference, which is a common issue for diffusion models, and (3) weak
alignment with input conditions, which is a critical issue for medical imaging.
MAISI, a previously proposed framework, addresses generalizability issues but
still suffers from slow inference and limited condition consistency. In this
work, we present MAISI-v2, the first accelerated 3D medical image synthesis
framework that integrates rectified flow to enable fast and high quality
generation. To further enhance condition fidelity, we introduce a novel
region-specific contrastive loss to enhance the sensitivity to region of
interest. Our experiments show that MAISI-v2 can achieve SOTA image quality
with $33 \times$ acceleration for latent diffusion model. We also conducted a
downstream segmentation experiment to show that the synthetic images can be
used for data augmentation. We release our code, training details, model
weights, and a GUI demo to facilitate reproducibility and promote further
development within the community.

### [6] [Few-Shot Deployment of Pretrained MRI Transformers in Brain Imaging Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05783)
*Mengyu Li,Guoyao Shen,Chad W. Farris,Xin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于预训练MRI变换器的少样本部署框架，结合MAE预训练策略和混合架构MAE-FUnet，在数据有限条件下实现高效、稳定的医学影像任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学影像中标注数据稀缺的问题，提升变换器模型在实际应用中的泛化能力。

Method: 采用MAE预训练策略在大规模多队列脑MRI数据集上获取可迁移的潜在表示，结合轻量级线性头或混合架构MAE-FUnet完成分类和分割任务。

Result: 在MRI序列识别中达到SOTA精度，在分割任务中优于基线模型，表现出高效、稳定和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该框架适用于低资源临床环境和广泛的神经影像应用。

Abstract: Machine learning using transformers has shown great potential in medical
imaging, but its real-world applicability remains limited due to the scarcity
of annotated data. In this study, we propose a practical framework for the
few-shot deployment of pretrained MRI transformers in diverse brain imaging
tasks. By utilizing the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pretraining strategy on a
large-scale, multi-cohort brain MRI dataset comprising over 31 million slices,
we obtain highly transferable latent representations that generalize well
across tasks and datasets. For high-level tasks such as classification, a
frozen MAE encoder combined with a lightweight linear head achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy in MRI sequence identification with minimal
supervision. For low-level tasks such as segmentation, we propose MAE-FUnet, a
hybrid architecture that fuses multiscale CNN features with pretrained MAE
embeddings. This model consistently outperforms other strong baselines in both
skull stripping and multi-class anatomical segmentation under data-limited
conditions. With extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, our
framework demonstrates efficiency, stability, and scalability, suggesting its
suitability for low-resource clinical environments and broader neuroimaging
applications.

### [7] [Optimization-Free Style Transfer for 3D Gaussian Splats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05813)
*Raphael Du Sablon,David Hart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需重建或优化的3D高斯样条风格迁移方法，通过生成样条表示的隐式表面图结构，实现快速风格迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要重建或优化样条，或训练特征提取网络，效率较低。

Method: 生成样条表示的隐式表面图结构，使用前馈表面风格化方法并插值回样条。

Result: 无需额外训练或优化，支持任意风格图像和3D高斯样条，速度在2分钟内完成。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且通用，适用于消费级硬件，代码已开源。

Abstract: The task of style transfer for 3D Gaussian splats has been explored in many
previous works, but these require reconstructing or fine-tuning the splat while
incorporating style information or optimizing a feature extraction network on
the splat representation. We propose a reconstruction- and optimization-free
approach to stylizing 3D Gaussian splats. This is done by generating a graph
structure across the implicit surface of the splat representation. A
feed-forward, surface-based stylization method is then used and interpolated
back to the individual splats in the scene. This allows for any style image and
3D Gaussian splat to be used without any additional training or optimization.
This also allows for fast stylization of splats, achieving speeds under 2
minutes even on consumer-grade hardware. We demonstrate the quality results
this approach achieves and compare to other 3D Gaussian splat style transfer
methods. Code is publicly available at
https://github.com/davidmhart/FastSplatStyler.

### [8] [MZEN: Multi-Zoom Enhanced NeRF for 3-D Reconstruction with Unknown Camera Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05819)
*Jong-Ik Park,Carlee Joe-Wong,Gary K. Fedder*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MZEN是一种改进的NeRF框架，通过处理多缩放图像集，解决了工业检测中高分辨率细节缺失的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业检测需要捕捉亚微米级细节，但现有NeRF方法在多缩放图像下无法保持多视角一致性。

Method: MZEN引入可学习的缩放标量，并通过宽场图像和缩放图像联合优化姿态。

Result: 在多种场景下，MZEN显著提升PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS指标。

Conclusion: MZEN成功将NeRF应用于工业检测，兼顾全局精度和细节捕捉。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) methods excel at 3D reconstruction from
multiple 2D images, even those taken with unknown camera poses. However, they
still miss the fine-detailed structures that matter in industrial inspection,
e.g., detecting sub-micron defects on a production line or analyzing chips with
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). In these scenarios, the sensor resolution
is fixed and compute budgets are tight, so the only way to expose fine
structure is to add zoom-in images; yet, this breaks the multi-view consistency
that pose-free NeRF training relies on. We propose Multi-Zoom Enhanced NeRF
(MZEN), the first NeRF framework that natively handles multi-zoom image sets.
MZEN (i) augments the pin-hole camera model with an explicit, learnable zoom
scalar that scales the focal length, and (ii) introduces a novel pose strategy:
wide-field images are solved first to establish a global metric frame, and
zoom-in images are then pose-primed to the nearest wide-field counterpart via a
zoom-consistent crop-and-match procedure before joint refinement. Across eight
forward-facing scenes$\unicode{x2013}$synthetic TCAD models, real SEM of
micro-structures, and BLEFF objects$\unicode{x2013}$MZEN consistently
outperforms pose-free baselines and even high-resolution variants, boosting
PSNR by up to $28 \%$, SSIM by $10 \%$, and reducing LPIPS by up to $222 \%$.
MZEN, therefore, extends NeRF to real-world factory settings, preserving global
accuracy while capturing the micron-level details essential for industrial
inspection.

### [9] [TSMS-SAM2: Multi-scale Temporal Sampling Augmentation and Memory-Splitting Pruning for Promptable Video Object Segmentation and Tracking in Surgical Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05829)
*Guoping Xu,Hua-Chieh Shao,You Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TSMS-SAM2是一种新型框架，通过多时间尺度视频采样增强和内存分割修剪机制，提升了手术视频中可提示视频对象分割与跟踪的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决手术视频中复杂运动动态和内存冗余对基础模型（如SAM2）应用的挑战。

Method: 引入多时间尺度视频采样增强和内存分割修剪机制。

Result: 在EndoVis2017和EndoVis2018数据集上分别达到95.24和86.73的Dice分数，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TSMS-SAM2在复杂手术场景中表现出高效、准确的分割潜力。

Abstract: Promptable video object segmentation and tracking (VOST) has seen significant
advances with the emergence of foundation models like Segment Anything Model 2
(SAM2); however, their application in surgical video analysis remains
challenging due to complex motion dynamics and the redundancy of memory that
impedes effective learning. In this work, we propose TSMS-SAM2, a novel
framework that enhances promptable VOST in surgical videos by addressing
challenges of rapid object motion and memory redundancy in SAM2. TSMS-SAM2
introduces two key strategies: multi-temporal-scale video sampling augmentation
to improve robustness against motion variability, and a memory splitting and
pruning mechanism that organizes and filters past frame features for more
efficient and accurate segmentation. Evaluated on EndoVis2017 and EndoVis2018
datasets, TSMS-SAM2 achieved the highest mean Dice scores of 95.24 and 86.73,
respectively, outperforming prior SAM-based and task-specific methods.
Extensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of multiscale temporal
augmentation and memory splitting, highlighting the framework's potential for
robust, efficient segmentation in complex surgical scenarios. Our source code
will be available at https://github.com/apple1986/TSMS-SAM2.

*Ka-Wai Yung,Felix J. S. Bragman,Jialang Xu,Imanol Luengo,Danail Stoyanov,Evangelos B. Mazomenos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TCA的轻量级策略，通过利用帧间时间一致性优化视频分割中的token聚类，显著减少计算量并保持细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Swin Transformer在视频分割中计算成本高，现有token剪枝方法因窗口注意力机制受限，且训练无关的聚类方法未利用时间冗余。

Method: 提出TCA策略，通过时间相关性优化token聚类，避免冗余token丢弃，保留细节。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，TCA提升了现有聚类方法的精度与速度平衡。

Conclusion: TCA在自然和特定领域视频中均表现优异，是一种高效且无需微调的策略。

Abstract: Vision Transformers have substantially advanced the capabilities of
segmentation models across both image and video domains. Among them, the Swin
Transformer stands out for its ability to capture hierarchical, multi-scale
representations, making it a popular backbone for segmentation in videos.
However, despite its window-attention scheme, it still incurs a high
computational cost, especially in larger variants commonly used for dense
prediction in videos. This remains a major bottleneck for real-time,
resource-constrained applications. Whilst token reduction methods have been
proposed to alleviate this, the window-based attention mechanism of Swin
requires a fixed number of tokens per window, limiting the applicability of
conventional pruning techniques. Meanwhile, training-free token clustering
approaches have shown promise in image segmentation while maintaining window
consistency. Nevertheless, they fail to exploit temporal redundancy, missing a
key opportunity to further optimize video segmentation performance. We
introduce Temporal Cluster Assignment (TCA), a lightweight and effective,
fine-tuning-free strategy that enhances token clustering by leveraging temporal
coherence across frames. Instead of indiscriminately dropping redundant tokens,
TCA refines token clusters using temporal correlations, thereby retaining
fine-grained details while significantly reducing computation. Extensive
evaluations on YouTube-VIS 2019, YouTube-VIS 2021, OVIS, and a private surgical
video dataset show that TCA consistently boosts the accuracy-speed trade-off of
existing clustering-based methods. Our results demonstrate that TCA generalizes
competently across both natural and domain-specific videos.

*Kaiser Hamid,Khandakar Ashrafi Akbar,Nade Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉-语言框架的驾驶员视觉注意力预测方法，利用自然语言描述注意力变化，并通过少样本和零样本学习在静态RGB图像上实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注静态时刻的注意力分配，缺乏对注意力动态变化的描述。本文旨在通过自然语言建模驾驶员的视线变化，为自动驾驶和HCI提供可解释的AI方法。

Method: 结合BDD-A数据集的高质量标注，通过人类反馈优化LLaVA模型，整合低层视觉线索和上下文信息（如路线语义、风险预测），生成基于语言的注意力描述。

Result: 优化后的模型在注意力转移检测和可解释性上优于通用视觉-语言模型，并通过领域特定指标验证了语义对齐和响应多样性。

Conclusion: 该方法首次用自然语言预测驾驶员注意力分配和转移，为自动驾驶中的可解释AI提供了新方向，并支持下游任务如行为预测和人机协作。

Abstract: Driver visual attention prediction is a critical task in autonomous driving
and human-computer interaction (HCI) research. Most prior studies focus on
estimating attention allocation at a single moment in time, typically using
static RGB images such as driving scene pictures. In this work, we propose a
vision-language framework that models the changing landscape of drivers' gaze
through natural language, using few-shot and zero-shot learning on single RGB
images. We curate and refine high-quality captions from the BDD-A dataset using
human-in-the-loop feedback, then fine-tune LLaVA to align visual perception
with attention-centric scene understanding. Our approach integrates both
low-level cues and top-down context (e.g., route semantics, risk anticipation),
enabling language-based descriptions of gaze behavior. We evaluate performance
across training regimes (few shot, and one-shot) and introduce domain-specific
metrics for semantic alignment and response diversity. Results show that our
fine-tuned model outperforms general-purpose VLMs in attention shift detection
and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is among the first attempts to
generate driver visual attention allocation and shifting predictions in natural
language, offering a new direction for explainable AI in autonomous driving.
Our approach provides a foundation for downstream tasks such as behavior
forecasting, human-AI teaming, and multi-agent coordination.

*Qiaomu Miao,Vivek Raju Golani,Jingyi Xu,Progga Paromita Dutta,Minh Hoai,Dimitris Samaras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用多视角相机进行视线目标估计（GTE）的方法，通过整合不同视角的信息提高准确性和适用性，解决了单视角方法中的人脸遮挡、目标模糊和视野外目标等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单视角GTE方法存在人脸遮挡、目标模糊和视野外目标等局限性，多视角方法能有效解决这些问题并提升性能。

Method: 方法包括头部信息聚合（HIA）模块、基于不确定性的视线选择（UGS）模块和基于极线的场景注意力（ESA）模块，输入为一对相机视角。

Result: 该方法显著优于单视角基线，尤其在第二视角能清晰捕捉人脸时表现更佳，并能仅通过第二视角图像估计第一视角的视线目标。

Conclusion: 多视角GTE方法在性能和功能上优于单视角方法，同时提供了多视角数据集以支持未来研究。

Abstract: This paper presents a method that utilizes multiple camera views for the gaze
target estimation (GTE) task. The approach integrates information from
different camera views to improve accuracy and expand applicability, addressing
limitations in existing single-view methods that face challenges such as face
occlusion, target ambiguity, and out-of-view targets. Our method processes a
pair of camera views as input, incorporating a Head Information Aggregation
(HIA) module for leveraging head information from both views for more accurate
gaze estimation, an Uncertainty-based Gaze Selection (UGS) for identifying the
most reliable gaze output, and an Epipolar-based Scene Attention (ESA) module
for cross-view background information sharing. This approach significantly
outperforms single-view baselines, especially when the second camera provides a
clear view of the person's face. Additionally, our method can estimate the gaze
target in the first view using the image of the person in the second view only,
a capability not possessed by single-view GTE methods. Furthermore, the paper
introduces a multi-view dataset for developing and evaluating multi-view GTE
methods. Data and code are available at

### [13] [ETTA: Efficient Test-Time Adaptation for Vision-Language Models through Dynamic Embedding Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05898)
*Hamidreza Dastmalchi,Aijun An,Ali cheraghian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ETTA提出了一种高效的测试时适应方法，通过递归更新模块和自适应集成模块，动态优化决策边界和提示选择，显著提升了CLIP等预训练视觉语言模型在分布偏移下的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在零样本任务中表现良好，但在分布偏移下泛化能力不足。现有的测试时适应方法（TTA）中，基于缓存的训练无关方法效率高，但仅存储高置信度样本，限制了决策边界的优化。

Method: ETTA引入递归更新模块，动态整合所有测试样本以优化决策边界，并采用自适应集成模块减少对提示的依赖。通过置信度动态结合两个模块的输出。

Result: 在两个基准测试中，ETTA在计算复杂度和准确性上均优于现有TTA模型。

Conclusion: ETTA为高效、有效的测试时适应设定了新标准，代码已开源。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP show strong zero-shot
performance but struggle with generalization under distribution shifts.
Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this by adapting VLMs to unlabeled test
data in new domains. While some TTA methods rely on prompt-tuning,
training-free cache-based approaches are preferred for efficiency. However,
current cache-based TTA models store only a limited set of high-confidence
samples, restricting the decision boundary to these samples and ignoring the
influence of other incoming test data. To address this, we propose Efficient
Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), introducing a Recursive Updating module that
integrates all incoming test samples, progressively refining the decision
boundary. This strategy mimics an unbounded cache, dynamically updating
contextual embeddings for improved accuracy with minimal memory and
computational overhead. ETTA also includes an Adaptive Ensemble module to
reduce prompt dependency in image-to-text scores by dynamically selecting
optimal prompts for each class. Furthermore, ETTA adaptively combines scores
from both modules based on confidence levels, leveraging their complementary
strengths. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks confirm that ETTA surpasses
the state-of-the-art TTA models in computational complexity and accuracy,
setting a new standard for effective, efficient test-time adaptation. The code
has been released at https://github.com/hamidreza-dastmalchi/ETTA.

*Zixuan Bian,Ruohan Ren,Yue Yang,Chris Callison-Burch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOLODECK 2.0是一个基于视觉语言模型的3D场景生成框架，支持交互式编辑和多样化风格生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D场景生成依赖大量人工，且现有自动化方法难以支持开放域场景和灵活编辑。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型解析输入文本，生成高质量3D资产，并通过空间约束实现语义和物理合理的布局。

Result: HOLODECK 2.0在生成与文本描述高度一致的场景上优于基线方法，支持灵活编辑。

Conclusion: HOLODECK 2.0在游戏建模等应用中具有潜力，能提升效率并生成沉浸式环境。

Abstract: 3D scene generation plays a crucial role in gaming, artistic creation,
virtual reality and many other domains. However, current 3D scene design still
relies heavily on extensive manual effort from creators, and existing automated
methods struggle to generate open-domain scenes or support flexible editing. As
a result, generating 3D worlds directly from text has garnered increasing
attention. In this paper, we introduce HOLODECK 2.0, an advanced
vision-language-guided framework for 3D world generation with support for
interactive scene editing based on human feedback. HOLODECK 2.0 can generate
diverse and stylistically rich 3D scenes (e.g., realistic, cartoon, anime, and
cyberpunk styles) that exhibit high semantic fidelity to fine-grained input
descriptions, suitable for both indoor and open-domain environments. HOLODECK
2.0 leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to identify and parse the objects
required in a scene and generates corresponding high-quality assets via
state-of-the-art 3D generative models. It then iteratively applies spatial
constraints derived from the VLMs to achieve semantically coherent and
physically plausible layouts. Human evaluations and CLIP-based assessments
demonstrate that HOLODECK 2.0 effectively generates high-quality scenes closely
aligned with detailed textual descriptions, consistently outperforming
baselines across indoor and open-domain scenarios. Additionally, we provide
editing capabilities that flexibly adapt to human feedback, supporting layout
refinement and style-consistent object edits. Finally, we present a practical
application of HOLODECK 2.0 in procedural game modeling, generating visually
rich and immersive environments, potentially boosting efficiency.

Abstract: We present \textit{RopStitch}, an unsupervised deep image stitching framework
with both robustness and naturalness. To ensure the robustness of
\textit{RopStitch}, we propose to incorporate the universal prior of content
perception into the image stitching model by a dual-branch architecture. It
separately captures coarse and fine features and integrates them to achieve
highly generalizable performance across diverse unseen real-world scenes.
Concretely, the dual-branch model consists of a pretrained branch to capture
semantically invariant representations and a learnable branch to extract
fine-grained discriminative features, which are then merged into a whole by a
controllable factor at the correlation level. Besides, considering that content
alignment and structural preservation are often contradictory to each other, we
propose a concept of virtual optimal planes to relieve this conflict. To this
end, we model this problem as a process of estimating homography decomposition
coefficients, and design an iterative coefficient predictor and minimal
semantic distortion constraint to identify the optimal plane. This scheme is
finally incorporated into \textit{RopStitch} by warping both views onto the
optimal plane bidirectionally. Extensive experiments across various datasets
demonstrate that \textit{RopStitch} significantly outperforms existing methods,
particularly in scene robustness and content naturalness. The code is available

Conclusion: 神经场模型为移动计算成像提供了高效解决方案，适用于实际场景中的复杂任务。

Abstract: Over the past two decades, mobile imaging has experienced a profound
transformation, with cell phones rapidly eclipsing all other forms of digital
photography in popularity. Today's cell phones are equipped with a diverse
range of imaging technologies - laser depth ranging, multi-focal camera arrays,
and split-pixel sensors - alongside non-visual sensors such as gyroscopes,
accelerometers, and magnetometers. This, combined with on-board integrated
chips for image and signal processing, makes the cell phone a versatile
pocket-sized computational imaging platform. Parallel to this, we have seen in
recent years how neural fields - small neural networks trained to map
continuous spatial input coordinates to output signals - enable the
reconstruction of complex scenes without explicit data representations such as
pixel arrays or point clouds. In this thesis, I demonstrate how carefully
designed neural field models can compactly represent complex geometry and
lighting effects. Enabling applications such as depth estimation, layer
separation, and image stitching directly from collected in-the-wild mobile
photography data. These methods outperform state-of-the-art approaches without
relying on complex pre-processing steps, labeled ground truth data, or machine
learning priors. Instead, they leverage well-constructed, self-regularized
models that tackle challenging inverse problems through stochastic gradient
descent, fitting directly to raw measurements from a smartphone.

Abstract: Monitoring construction progress is crucial yet resource-intensive, prompting
the exploration of computer-vision-based methodologies for enhanced efficiency
and scalability. Traditional data acquisition methods, primarily focusing on
indoor environments, falter in construction site's complex, cluttered, and
dynamically changing conditions. This paper critically evaluates the
application of two advanced 3D segmentation methods, Segment Anything Model
(SAM) and Mask3D, in challenging outdoor and indoor conditions. Trained
initially on indoor datasets, both models' adaptability and performance are
assessed in real-world construction settings, highlighting the gap in current
segmentation approaches due to the absence of benchmarks for outdoor scenarios.
Through a comparative analysis, this study not only showcases the relative
effectiveness of SAM and Mask3D but also addresses the critical need for
tailored segmentation workflows capable of extracting actionable insights from
construction site data, thereby advancing the field towards more automated and
precise monitoring techniques.

Conclusion: SINGAD通过物理建模和自监督优化，显著提升了单图像法线估计的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: The lack of spatial dimensional information remains a challenge in normal
estimation from a single image. Recent diffusion-based methods have
demonstrated significant potential in 2D-to-3D implicit mapping, they rely on
data-driven statistical priors and miss the explicit modeling of light-surface
interaction, leading to multi-view normal direction conflicts. Moreover, the
discrete sampling mechanism of diffusion models causes gradient discontinuity
in differentiable rendering reconstruction modules, preventing 3D geometric
errors from being backpropagated to the normal generation network, thereby
forcing existing methods to depend on dense normal annotations. This paper
proposes SINGAD, a novel Self-supervised framework from a single Image for
Normal estimation via 3D GAussian splatting guided Diffusion. By integrating
physics-driven light-interaction modeling and a differentiable rendering-based
reprojection strategy, our framework directly converts 3D geometric errors into
normal optimization signals, solving the challenges of multi-view geometric
inconsistency and data dependency. Specifically, the framework constructs a
light-interaction-driven 3DGS reparameterization model to generate multi-scale
geometric features consistent with light transport principles, ensuring
multi-view normal consistency. A cross-domain feature fusion module is designed
within a conditional diffusion model, embedding geometric priors to constrain
normal generation while maintaining accurate geometric error propagation.
Furthermore, a differentiable 3D reprojection loss strategy is introduced for
self-supervised optimization that minimizes geometric error between the
reconstructed and input image, eliminating dependence on annotated normal
datasets. Quantitative evaluations on the Google Scanned Objects dataset
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across
multiple metrics.

Result: Bifrost-1在视觉保真度和多模态理解上表现优异，训练计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 该框架有效整合了预训练模型，实现了高效可控的图像生成，并通过消融实验验证了设计选择的有效性。

Abstract: There is growing interest in integrating high-fidelity visual synthesis
capabilities into large language models (LLMs) without compromising their
strong reasoning capabilities. Existing methods that directly train LLMs or
bridge LLMs and diffusion models usually suffer from costly training since the
backbone LLMs have not seen image representations during pretraining. We
present Bifrost-1, a unified framework that bridges pretrained multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs) and diffusion models using patch-level CLIP image embeddings as latent
variables, which are natively aligned with the MLLM's CLIP visual encoder.
These patch-level image embeddings are integrated into the diffusion model with
a lightweight adaptation of its ControlNet. To retain the original multimodal
reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, we equip the MLLM with a visual generation
branch initialized from the original MLLM parameters when predicting the
patch-level image embeddings. By seamlessly integrating pretrained MLLMs and
diffusion models with patch-level CLIP latents, our framework enables
high-fidelity controllable image generation with significant training
efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that Bifrost-1 achieves comparable or
better performance than previous methods in terms of visual fidelity and
multimodal understanding, with substantially lower compute during training. We
also provide comprehensive ablation studies showing the effectiveness of our
design choices.

Motivation: 机器人操作中高层任务语义与低层几何特征的割裂问题限制了视觉语言模型的应用，需要更动态的语义-可用性关系捕捉方法。

Method: PASG框架包括自动基元提取、VLM驱动的语义锚定和空间语义推理基准，结合微调的VLM模型Qwen2.5VL-PA。

Result: PASG在多样化机器人操作任务中表现优异，性能接近人工标注，实现了更细粒度的语义-可用性理解。

Conclusion: PASG为机器人操作中几何基元与任务语义的统一提供了新范式。

Abstract: The fragmentation between high-level task semantics and low-level geometric
features remains a persistent challenge in robotic manipulation. While
vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in generating affordance-aware
visual representations, the lack of semantic grounding in canonical spaces and
reliance on manual annotations severely limit their ability to capture dynamic
semantic-affordance relationships. To address these, we propose Primitive-Aware
Semantic Grounding (PASG), a closed-loop framework that introduces: (1)
Automatic primitive extraction through geometric feature aggregation, enabling
cross-category detection of keypoints and axes; (2) VLM-driven semantic
anchoring that dynamically couples geometric primitives with functional
affordances and task-relevant description; (3) A spatial-semantic reasoning
benchmark and a fine-tuned VLM (Qwen2.5VL-PA). We demonstrate PASG's
effectiveness in practical robotic manipulation tasks across diverse scenarios,
achieving performance comparable to manual annotations. PASG achieves a
finer-grained semantic-affordance understanding of objects, establishing a
unified paradigm for bridging geometric primitives with task semantics in
robotic manipulation.

Result: 实验表明AnimateScene能生成高几何细节和时空一致性的动态场景视频。

Conclusion: AnimateScene有效解决了3D场景与4D人体动画集成的关键问题，实现了视觉一致的动态视频。

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction and 4D human animation have seen rapid progress and
broad adoption in recent years. However, seamlessly integrating reconstructed
scenes with 4D human animation to produce visually engaging results remains
challenging. One key difficulty lies in placing the human at the correct
location and scale within the scene while avoiding unrealistic
interpenetration. Another challenge is that the human and the background may
exhibit different lighting and style, leading to unrealistic composites. In
addition, appealing character motion videos are often accompanied by camera
movements, which means that the viewpoints need to be reconstructed along a
specified trajectory. We present AnimateScene, which addresses the above issues
in a unified framework. First, we design an accurate placement module that
automatically determines a plausible 3D position for the human and prevents any
interpenetration within the scene during motion. Second, we propose a
training-free style alignment method that adapts the 4D human representation to
match the background's lighting and style, achieving coherent visual
integration. Finally, we design a joint post-reconstruction method for both the
4D human and the 3D scene that allows camera trajectories to be inserted,
enabling the final rendered video to feature visually appealing camera
movements. Extensive experiments show that AnimateScene generates dynamic scene
videos with high geometric detail and spatiotemporal coherence across various
camera and action combinations.

Motivation: 解决预训练模型在目标数据上因协变量偏移导致的预测错误问题。

Method: 通过对抗扰动探索数据空间，训练能量模型评分预测的深度区域是否属于源数据分布，并在测试时调整模型参数以最小化能量。

Result: 在三个室内和三个室外数据集上，ETA平均优于之前的最优方法（室外6.94%，室内10.23%）。

Conclusion: ETA通过测试时适应显著提升了深度补全模型在目标数据上的性能。

Abstract: We propose a method for test-time adaptation of pretrained depth completion
models. Depth completion models, trained on some ``source'' data, often predict
erroneous outputs when transferred to ``target'' data captured in novel
environmental conditions due to a covariate shift. The crux of our method lies
in quantifying the likelihood of depth predictions belonging to the source data
distribution. The challenge is in the lack of access to out-of-distribution
(target) data prior to deployment. Hence, rather than making assumptions
regarding the target distribution, we utilize adversarial perturbations as a
mechanism to explore the data space. This enables us to train an energy model
that scores local regions of depth predictions as in- or out-of-distribution.
We update the parameters of pretrained depth completion models at test time to
minimize energy, effectively aligning test-time predictions to those of the
source distribution. We call our method ``Energy-based Test-time Adaptation'',
or ETA for short. We evaluate our method across three indoor and three outdoor
datasets, where ETA improve over the previous state-of-the-art method by an
average of 6.94% for outdoors and 10.23% for indoors. Project Page:

Result: 在多个视频计算机视觉任务中，该方法实现了显著加速，性能损失较小。

Conclusion: 所提系统在减少计算开销的同时保持了较高的性能，为高效视频处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: The efficiency of video computer vision system remains a challenging task due
to the high temporal redundancy inside a video. Existing works have been
proposed for efficient vision computer vision. However, they do not fully
reduce the temporal redundancy and neglect the front end computation overhead.
In this paper, we propose an efficient video computer vision system. First,
image signal processor is removed and Bayer-format data is directly fed into
video computer vision models, thus saving the front end computation. Second,
instead of optical flow models and video codecs, a fast block matching-based
motion estimation algorithm is proposed specifically for efficient video
computer vision, with a MV refinement module. To correct the error,
context-aware block refinement network is introduced to refine regions with
large error. To further balance the accuracy and efficiency, a frame selection
strategy is employed. Experiments on multiple video computer vision tasks
demonstrate that our method achieves significant acceleration with slight
performance loss.

Conclusion: 提出的框架在多模态情感识别中表现优异，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Emotion recognition plays a vital role in enhancing human-computer
interaction. In this study, we tackle the MER-SEMI challenge of the MER2025
competition by proposing a novel multimodal emotion recognition framework. To
address the issue of data scarcity, we leverage large-scale pre-trained models
to extract informative features from visual, audio, and textual modalities.
Specifically, for the visual modality, we design a dual-branch visual encoder
that captures both global frame-level features and localized facial
representations. For the textual modality, we introduce a context-enriched
method that employs large language models to enrich emotional cues within the
input text. To effectively integrate these multimodal features, we propose a
fusion strategy comprising two key components, i.e., self-attention mechanisms
for dynamic modality weighting, and residual connections to preserve original
representations. Beyond architectural design, we further refine noisy labels in
the training set by a multi-source labeling strategy. Our approach achieves a
substantial performance improvement over the official baseline on the
MER2025-SEMI dataset, attaining a weighted F-score of 87.49% compared to
78.63%, thereby validating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在面部化妆编辑中常因缺乏结构化配对数据导致结果质量低，无法同时保持身份和化妆保真度。

Method: 引入MakeupQuad数据集，并提出EvoMakeup框架，通过多阶段蒸馏减少图像退化，支持迭代改进数据和模型质量。

Result: EvoMakeup在真实场景中表现优异，支持高保真、可控的多任务化妆编辑，包括基于参考和文本的编辑。

Conclusion: 该方法在化妆保真度和身份保持上取得平衡，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Facial makeup editing aims to realistically transfer makeup from a reference
to a target face. Existing methods often produce low-quality results with
coarse makeup details and struggle to preserve both identity and makeup
fidelity, mainly due to the lack of structured paired data -- where source and
result share identity, and reference and result share identical makeup. To
address this, we introduce MakeupQuad, a large-scale, high-quality dataset with
non-makeup faces, references, edited results, and textual makeup descriptions.
Building on this, we propose EvoMakeup, a unified training framework that
mitigates image degradation during multi-stage distillation, enabling iterative
improvement of both data and model quality. Although trained solely on
synthetic data, EvoMakeup generalizes well and outperforms prior methods on
real-world benchmarks. It supports high-fidelity, controllable, multi-task
makeup editing -- including full-face and partial reference-based editing, as
well as text-driven makeup editing -- within a single model. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method achieves superior makeup fidelity and
identity preservation, effectively balancing both aspects. Code and dataset
will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual mathematical reasoning across various existing
benchmarks. However, these benchmarks are predominantly based on clean or
processed multimodal inputs, without incorporating the images provided by
real-world Kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12) educational users. To address
this gap, we introduce MathReal, a meticulously curated dataset comprising
2,000 mathematical questions with images captured by handheld mobile devices in
authentic scenarios. Each question is an image, containing the question text
and visual element. We systematically classify the real images into three
primary categories: image quality degradation, perspective variation, and
irrelevant content interference, which are further delineated into 14
subcategories. Additionally, MathReal spans five core knowledge and ability
categories, which encompass three question types and are divided into three
difficulty levels. To comprehensively evaluate the multimodal mathematical
reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs in real-world scenarios, we
design six experimental settings that enable a systematic analysis of their
performance. Through extensive experimentation, we find that the
problem-solving abilities of existing MLLMs are significantly challenged in
realistic educational contexts. Based on this, we conduct a thorough analysis
of their performance and error patterns, providing insights into their
recognition, comprehension, and reasoning capabilities, and outlining
directions for future improvements. Data and code:

Abstract: Recent advances in novel view synthesis (NVS) have enabled real-time
rendering with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, existing methods struggle
with artifacts and missing regions when rendering from viewpoints that deviate
from the training trajectory, limiting seamless scene exploration. To address
this, we propose a 3DGS-based pipeline that generates additional training views
to enhance reconstruction. We introduce an information-gain-driven virtual
camera placement strategy to maximize scene coverage, followed by video
diffusion priors to refine rendered results. Fine-tuning 3D Gaussians with
these enhanced views significantly improves reconstruction quality. To evaluate
our method, we present Wild-Explore, a benchmark designed for challenging scene
exploration. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
3DGS-based methods, enabling high-quality, artifact-free rendering from
arbitrary viewpoints.

Abstract: Sub-visible particle analysis using flow imaging microscopy combined with
deep learning has proven effective in identifying particle types, enabling the
distinction of harmless components such as silicone oil from protein particles.
However, the scarcity of available data and severe imbalance between particle
types within datasets remain substantial hurdles when applying multi-class
classifiers to such problems, often forcing researchers to rely on less
effective methods. The aforementioned issue is particularly challenging for
particle types that appear unintentionally and in lower numbers, such as
silicone oil and air bubbles, as opposed to protein particles, where obtaining
large numbers of images through controlled settings is comparatively
straightforward. In this work, we develop a state-of-the-art diffusion model to
address data imbalance by generating high-fidelity images that can augment
training datasets, enabling the effective training of multi-class deep neural
networks. We validate this approach by demonstrating that the generated samples
closely resemble real particle images in terms of visual quality and structure.
To assess the effectiveness of using diffusion-generated images in training
datasets, we conduct large-scale experiments on a validation dataset comprising
500,000 protein particle images and demonstrate that this approach improves
classification performance with no negligible downside. Finally, to promote
open research and reproducibility, we publicly release both our diffusion
models and the trained multi-class deep neural network classifiers, along with
a straightforward interface for easy integration into future studies, at

Abstract: Existing methods for human parsing into body parts and clothing often use
fixed mask categories with broad labels that obscure fine-grained clothing
types. Recent open-vocabulary segmentation approaches leverage pretrained
text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model features for strong zero-shot transfer, but
typically group entire humans into a single person category, failing to
distinguish diverse clothing or detailed body parts. To address this, we
propose Spectrum, a unified network for part-level pixel parsing (body parts
and clothing) and instance-level grouping. While diffusion-based
open-vocabulary models generalize well across tasks, their internal
representations are not specialized for detailed human parsing. We observe
that, unlike diffusion models with broad representations, image-driven 3D
texture generators maintain faithful correspondence to input images, enabling
stronger representations for parsing diverse clothing and body parts. Spectrum
introduces a novel repurposing of an Image-to-Texture (I2Tx) diffusion model --
obtained by fine-tuning a T2I model on 3D human texture maps -- for improved
alignment with body parts and clothing. From an input image, we extract
human-part internal features via the I2Tx diffusion model and generate
semantically valid masks aligned to diverse clothing categories through
prompt-guided grounding. Once trained, Spectrum produces semantic segmentation
maps for every visible body part and clothing category, ignoring standalone
garments or irrelevant objects, for any number of humans in the scene. We
conduct extensive cross-dataset experiments -- separately assessing body parts,
clothing parts, unseen clothing categories, and full-body masks -- and
demonstrate that Spectrum consistently outperforms baseline methods in
prompt-based segmentation.

Motivation: 旨在开发一种快速且高质量的文本引导图像编辑方法，同时保留关键内容并遵循文本指令。

Method: 采用RectifiedFlow框架，结合PerRFI反演策略、Inversion Latent Injection技术和Disentangled Prompt Guidance，并集成Canny-conditioned ControlNet。

Result: 在PIE数据集上，InstantEdit在速度和编辑质量上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: InstantEdit通过创新的反演和再生技术，实现了快速且高质量的图像编辑。

Abstract: We propose a fast text-guided image editing method called InstantEdit based
on the RectifiedFlow framework, which is structured as a few-step editing
process that preserves critical content while following closely to textual
instructions. Our approach leverages the straight sampling trajectories of
RectifiedFlow by introducing a specialized inversion strategy called PerRFI. To
maintain consistent while editable results for RectifiedFlow model, we further
propose a novel regeneration method, Inversion Latent Injection, which
effectively reuses latent information obtained during inversion to facilitate
more coherent and detailed regeneration. Additionally, we propose a
Disentangled Prompt Guidance technique to balance editability with detail
preservation, and integrate a Canny-conditioned ControlNet to incorporate
structural cues and suppress artifacts. Evaluation on the PIE image editing
dataset demonstrates that InstantEdit is not only fast but also achieves better
qualitative and quantitative results compared to state-of-the-art few-step
editing methods.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效利用了多模态和未标注数据，显著提升了情感识别性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we present our solution for the semi-supervised learning track
(MER-SEMI) in MER2025. We propose a comprehensive framework, grounded in the
principle that "more is better," to construct a robust Mixture of Experts (MoE)
emotion recognition system. Our approach integrates a diverse range of input
modalities as independent experts, including novel signals such as knowledge
from large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and temporal Action Unit (AU)
information. To effectively utilize unlabeled data, we introduce a
consensus-based pseudo-labeling strategy, generating high-quality labels from
the agreement between a baseline model and Gemini, which are then used in a
two-stage training paradigm. Finally, we employ a multi-expert voting ensemble
combined with a rule-based re-ranking process to correct prediction bias and
better align the outputs with human preferences. Evaluated on the MER2025-SEMI
challenge dataset, our method achieves an F1-score of 0.8772 on the test set,
ranking 2nd in the track. Our code is available at

*Huanyu Wang,Jushi Kai,Haoli Bai,Lu Hou,Bo Jiang,Ziwei He,Zhouhan Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fourier-VLM通过频域压缩视觉表示，减少计算开销和推理延迟，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）中视觉特征的高计算开销和推理延迟问题。

Method: 利用二维离散余弦变换（DCT）对视觉特征进行低通滤波，通过FFT高效计算。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，推理FLOPs减少83.8%，生成速度提升31.2%。

Conclusion: Fourier-VLM高效且实用，适用于多种架构。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) typically replace the predefined image
placeholder token (<image>) in textual instructions with visual features from
an image encoder, forming the input to a backbone Large Language Model (LLM).
However, the large number of vision tokens significantly increases the context
length, leading to high computational overhead and inference latency. While
previous efforts mitigate this by selecting only important visual features or
leveraging learnable queries to reduce token count, they often compromise
performance or introduce substantial extra costs. In response, we propose
Fourier-VLM, a simple yet efficient method that compresses visual
representations in the frequency domain. Our approach is motivated by the
observation that vision features output from the vision encoder exhibit
concentrated energy in low-frequency components. Leveraging this, we apply a
low-pass filter to the vision features using a two-dimentional Discrete Cosine
Transform (DCT). Notably, the DCT is efficiently computed via the Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) operator with a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$,
minimizing the extra computational cost while introducing no additional
parameters. Extensive experiments across various image-based benchmarks
demonstrate that Fourier-VLM achieves competitive performance with strong
generalizability across both LLaVA and Qwen-VL architectures. Crucially, it
reduce inference FLOPs by up to 83.8% and boots generation speed by 31.2%
compared to LLaVA-v1.5, highlighting the superior efficiency and practicality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本引导图像编辑方法通常生成整个目标图像，导致计算资源浪费和非编辑区域重建偏差，影响编辑质量。

Method: 提出NEP方法，基于自回归图像生成，仅重新生成需要编辑的区域；预训练一个任意顺序自回归文本到图像（T2I）模型，支持零样本图像编辑。

Result: 在广泛使用的图像编辑基准测试中达到新的最优性能，并支持通过零样本方式迭代优化生成结果（TTS）。

Conclusion: NEP方法通过选择性编辑显著提升了图像编辑的效率和质量，同时支持灵活的零样本编辑和迭代优化。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing involves modifying a source image based on a
language instruction and, typically, requires changes to only small local
regions. However, existing approaches generate the entire target image rather
than selectively regenerate only the intended editing areas. This results in
(1) unnecessary computational costs and (2) a bias toward reconstructing
non-editing regions, which compromises the quality of the intended edits. To
resolve these limitations, we propose to formulate image editing as Next
Editing-token Prediction (NEP) based on autoregressive image generation, where
only regions that need to be edited are regenerated, thus avoiding unintended
modification to the non-editing areas. To enable any-region editing, we propose
to pre-train an any-order autoregressive text-to-image (T2I) model. Once
trained, it is capable of zero-shot image editing and can be easily adapted to
NEP for image editing, which achieves a new state-of-the-art on widely used
image editing benchmarks. Moreover, our model naturally supports test-time
scaling (TTS) through iteratively refining its generation in a zero-shot
manner. The project page is: https://nep-bigai.github.io/

TL;DR: VQAThinker是一个基于推理的视频质量评估框架，利用多模态模型和强化学习解决现有模型的泛化性和可解释性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA模型在泛化性和可解释性方面表现不足，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 采用GRPO强化学习算法，结合三种VQA特定奖励（回归、排序和时间一致性奖励），模拟人类感知决策。

Result: 在领域内和OOD基准测试中表现优异，同时在失真归因和质量描述任务中优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 强化学习为仅依赖分数级监督构建泛化性和可解释性VQA模型提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) aims to objectively quantify perceptual
quality degradation in alignment with human visual perception. Despite recent
advances, existing VQA models still suffer from two critical limitations:
\textit{poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) videos} and
\textit{limited explainability}, which restrict their applicability in
real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{VQAThinker}, a reasoning-based VQA framework that leverages large
multimodal models (LMMs) with reinforcement learning to jointly model video
quality understanding and scoring, emulating human perceptual decision-making.
Specifically, we adopt group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-guided
reinforcement learning algorithm that enables reasoning over video quality
under score-level supervision, and introduce three VQA-specific rewards: (1) a
\textbf{bell-shaped regression reward} that increases rapidly as the prediction
error decreases and becomes progressively less sensitive near the ground truth;
(2) a \textbf{pairwise ranking reward} that guides the model to correctly
determine the relative quality between video pairs; and (3) a \textbf{temporal
consistency reward} that encourages the model to prefer temporally coherent
videos over their perturbed counterparts. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VQAThinker achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and OOD
VQA benchmarks, showing strong generalization for video quality scoring.
Furthermore, evaluations on video quality understanding tasks validate its
superiority in distortion attribution and quality description compared to
existing explainable VQA models and LMMs. These findings demonstrate that
reinforcement learning offers an effective pathway toward building
generalizable and explainable VQA models solely with score-level supervision.

Conclusion: LV-Net为LV形状分析提供了更准确和稳健的工具，有助于神经系统疾病的研究和诊断。

Abstract: Lateral ventricle (LV) shape analysis holds promise as a biomarker for
neurological diseases; however, challenges remain due to substantial shape
variability across individuals and segmentation difficulties arising from
limited MRI resolution. We introduce LV-Net, a novel framework for producing
individualized 3D LV meshes from brain MRI by deforming an anatomy-aware joint
LV-hippocampus template mesh. By incorporating anatomical relationships
embedded within the joint template, LV-Net reduces boundary segmentation
artifacts and improves reconstruction robustness. In addition, by classifying
the vertices of the template mesh based on their anatomical adjacency, our
method enhances point correspondence across subjects, leading to more accurate
LV shape statistics. We demonstrate that LV-Net achieves superior
reconstruction accuracy, even in the presence of segmentation imperfections,
and delivers more reliable shape descriptors across diverse datasets. Finally,
we apply LV-Net to Alzheimer's disease analysis, identifying LV subregions that
show significantly associations with the disease relative to cognitively normal
controls. The codes for LV shape modeling are available at

Abstract: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is closer than ever to becoming a
reality, sparking widespread enthusiasm in the research community to collect
and work with various modalities, including text, image, video, and audio.
Despite recent efforts, satellite spectral imagery, as an additional modality,
has yet to receive the attention it deserves. This area presents unique
challenges, but also holds great promise in advancing the capabilities of AGI
in understanding the natural world. In this paper, we argue why Earth
Observation data is useful for an intelligent model, and then we review
existing benchmarks and highlight their limitations in evaluating the
generalization ability of foundation models in this domain. This paper
emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive benchmark to evaluate earth
observation models. To facilitate this, we propose a comprehensive set of tasks
that a benchmark should encompass to effectively assess a model's ability to
understand and interact with Earth observation data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HybridEVS相机结合Quad Bayer CFA传感器和事件像素时，缺乏颜色信息导致去马赛克过程中出现伪影和混叠问题，现有方法难以在资源有限的移动设备上解决这些问题。

Method: 提出TSANet，采用两阶段网络设计，分别处理事件像素修复和去马赛克任务，并引入轻量级的Cross-Swin State Block，利用位置先验和状态空间模型增强全局依赖。

Result: TSANet在模拟和真实HybridEVS数据上表现出色，PSNR和SSIM指标优于现有方法DemosaicFormer，同时参数和计算成本分别降低1.86倍和3.29倍。

Conclusion: TSANet为移动设备上的高效图像去马赛克提供了新思路，代码已开源。

Abstract: Event cameras like the Hybrid Event-based Vision Sensor (HybridEVS) camera
capture brightness changes as asynchronous "events" instead of frames, offering
advanced application on mobile photography. However, challenges arise from
combining a Quad Bayer Color Filter Array (CFA) sensor with event pixels
lacking color information, resulting in aliasing and artifacts on the
demosaicing process before downstream application. Current methods struggle to
address these issues, especially on resource-limited mobile devices. In
response, we introduce \textbf{TSANet}, a lightweight \textbf{T}wo-stage
network via \textbf{S}tate space augmented cross-\textbf{A}ttention, which can
handle event pixels inpainting and demosaicing separately, leveraging the
benefits of dividing complex tasks into manageable subtasks. Furthermore, we
introduce a lightweight Cross-Swin State Block that uniquely utilizes
positional prior for demosaicing and enhances global dependencies through the
state space model with linear complexity. In summary, TSANet demonstrates
excellent demosaicing performance on both simulated and real data of HybridEVS
while maintaining a lightweight model, averaging better results than the
previous state-of-the-art method DemosaicFormer across seven diverse datasets
in both PSNR and SSIM, while respectively reducing parameter and computation
costs by $1.86\times$ and $3.29\times$. Our approach presents new possibilities
for efficient image demosaicing on mobile devices. Code is available in the
supplementary materials.

Motivation: 尽管SOD和COD任务具有矛盾属性，但作者认为通过正确的学习方法，网络可以同时具备检测显著和伪装目标的能力。

Method: 提出SCJoint方案，学习SOD和COD解码过程的分布特性，并引入基于显著性的采样策略（SBSS）平衡训练集。

Result: 实验表明，JoNet网络在SOD和COD任务上均表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: SCJoint和SBSS有效实现了任务解耦和性能提升，证明了联合学习的可行性。

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) and camouflaged object detection (COD) are two
closely related but distinct computer vision tasks. Although both are
class-agnostic segmentation tasks that map from RGB space to binary space, the
former aims to identify the most salient objects in the image, while the latter
focuses on detecting perfectly camouflaged objects that blend into the
background in the image. These two tasks exhibit strong contradictory
attributes. Previous works have mostly believed that joint learning of these
two tasks would confuse the network, reducing its performance on both tasks.
However, here we present an opposite perspective: with the correct approach to
learning, the network can simultaneously possess the capability to find both
salient and camouflaged objects, allowing both tasks to benefit from joint
learning. We propose SCJoint, a joint learning scheme for SOD and COD tasks,
assuming that the decoding processes of SOD and COD have different distribution
characteristics. The key to our method is to learn the respective means and
variances of the decoding processes for both tasks by inserting a minimal
amount of task-specific learnable parameters within a fully shared network
structure, thereby decoupling the contradictory attributes of the two tasks at
a minimal cost. Furthermore, we propose a saliency-based sampling strategy
(SBSS) to sample the training set of the SOD task to balance the training set
sizes of the two tasks. In addition, SBSS improves the training set quality and
shortens the training time. Based on the proposed SCJoint and SBSS, we train a
powerful generalist network, named JoNet, which has the ability to
simultaneously capture both ``salient" and ``camouflaged". Extensive
experiments demonstrate the competitive performance and effectiveness of our
proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/linuxsino/JoNet.

Motivation: 现有基准测试无法提供直观的性能差异反馈，BioMotion Arena旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用成对比较评估，收集了53个主流模型在90种生物运动变体上的45k+投票。

Result: 数据表明众包投票与专家评分一致，且90%以上模型无法生成基本的人形点光源运动。

Conclusion: BioMotion Arena是一个具有挑战性的性能可视化基准测试框架。

Abstract: Evaluating the abilities of large models and manifesting their gaps are
challenging. Current benchmarks adopt either ground-truth-based score-form
evaluation on static datasets or indistinct textual chatbot-style human
preferences collection, which may not provide users with immediate, intuitive,
and perceptible feedback on performance differences. In this paper, we
introduce BioMotion Arena, a novel framework for evaluating large language
models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via visual
animation. Our methodology draws inspiration from the inherent visual
perception of motion patterns characteristic of living organisms that utilizes
point-light source imaging to amplify the performance discrepancies between
models. Specifically, we employ a pairwise comparison evaluation and collect
more than 45k votes for 53 mainstream LLMs and MLLMs on 90 biological motion
variants. Data analyses show that the crowd-sourced human votes are in good
agreement with those of expert raters, demonstrating the superiority of our
BioMotion Arena in offering discriminative feedback. We also find that over
90\% of evaluated models, including the cutting-edge open-source InternVL3 and
proprietary Claude-4 series, fail to produce fundamental humanoid point-light
groups, much less smooth and biologically plausible motions. This enables
BioMotion Arena to serve as a challenging benchmark for performance
visualization and a flexible evaluation framework without restrictions on
ground-truth.

Conclusion: 该方法无需CT，减少辐射，生成高分辨率3D形态，可作为术前蓝图，提升手术效果。

Abstract: To treat Trochlear Dysplasia (TD), current approaches rely mainly on
low-resolution clinical Magnetic Resonance (MR) scans and surgical intuition.
The surgeries are planned based on surgeons experience, have limited adoption
of minimally invasive techniques, and lead to inconsistent outcomes. We propose
a pipeline that generates super-resolved, patient-specific 3D pseudo-healthy
target morphologies from conventional clinical MR scans. First, we compute an
isotropic super-resolved MR volume using an Implicit Neural Representation
(INR). Next, we segment femur, tibia, patella, and fibula with a multi-label
custom-trained network. Finally, we train a Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM) to
generate pseudo-healthy target morphologies of the trochlear region. In
contrast to prior work producing pseudo-healthy low-resolution 3D MR images,
our approach enables the generation of sub-millimeter resolved 3D shapes
compatible for pre- and intraoperative use. These can serve as preoperative
blueprints for reshaping the femoral groove while preserving the native patella
articulation. Furthermore, and in contrast to other work, we do not require a
CT for our pipeline - reducing the amount of radiation. We evaluated our
approach on 25 TD patients and could show that our target morphologies
significantly improve the sulcus angle (SA) and trochlear groove depth (TGD).

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略（先图像后视频），结合拼贴和生成模型的数据合成方法，并设计高效的编辑框架。

Result: DreamVE在关键编辑类型上表现优异，具备良好的泛化和迁移能力，但属性编辑性能略有不足。

Conclusion: DreamVE通过统一框架和多样化数据合成，为基于指令的编辑提供了高效解决方案，未来将开源代码和模型。

Abstract: Instruction-based editing holds vast potential due to its simple and
efficient interactive editing format. However, instruction-based editing,
particularly for video, has been constrained by limited training data,
hindering its practical application. To this end, we introduce DreamVE, a
unified model for instruction-based image and video editing. Specifically, We
propose a two-stage training strategy: first image editing, then video editing.
This offers two main benefits: (1) Image data scales more easily, and models
are more efficient to train, providing useful priors for faster and better
video editing training. (2) Unifying image and video generation is natural and
aligns with current trends. Moreover, we present comprehensive training data
synthesis pipelines, including collage-based and generative model-based data
synthesis. The collage-based data synthesis combines foreground objects and
backgrounds to generate diverse editing data, such as object manipulation,
background changes, and text modifications. It can easily generate billions of
accurate, consistent, realistic, and diverse editing pairs. We pretrain DreamVE
on extensive collage-based data to achieve strong performance in key editing
types and enhance generalization and transfer capabilities. However,
collage-based data lacks some attribute editing cases, leading to a relative
drop in performance. In contrast, the generative model-based pipeline, despite
being hard to scale up, offers flexibility in handling attribute editing cases.
Therefore, we use generative model-based data to further fine-tune DreamVE.
Besides, we design an efficient and powerful editing framework for DreamVE. We
build on the SOTA T2V model and use a token concatenation with early drop
approach to inject source image guidance, ensuring strong consistency and
editability. The codes and models will be released.

Result: 在OpenVid-1M基准测试中，SwiftVideo显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SwiftVideo在少步视频生成中表现出色，平衡了速度和质量。

Abstract: Diffusion-based or flow-based models have achieved significant progress in
video synthesis but require multiple iterative sampling steps, which incurs
substantial computational overhead. While many distillation methods that are
solely based on trajectory-preserving or distribution-matching have been
developed to accelerate video generation models, these approaches often suffer
from performance breakdown or increased artifacts under few-step settings. To
address these limitations, we propose \textbf{\emph{SwiftVideo}}, a unified and
stable distillation framework that combines the advantages of
trajectory-preserving and distribution-matching strategies. Our approach
introduces continuous-time consistency distillation to ensure precise
preservation of ODE trajectories. Subsequently, we propose a dual-perspective
alignment that includes distribution alignment between synthetic and real data
along with trajectory alignment across different inference steps. Our method
maintains high-quality video generation while substantially reducing the number
of inference steps. Quantitative evaluations on the OpenVid-1M benchmark
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in
few-step video generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在推理时处理大量视觉令牌导致成本高昂，现有剪枝方法未能充分利用动态内部信号。

Method: 提出动态文本引导剪枝机制和跨模态注意力分析，设计更高效的剪枝策略。

Conclusion: AdaptInfer是一种轻量级、即插即用的通用框架，显著提升VLMs的推理效率。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance on
multimodal reasoning tasks such as visual question answering (VQA), but their
inference cost remains a significant challenge due to the large number of
vision tokens processed during the prefill stage. Existing pruning methods
often rely on directly using the attention patterns or static text prompt
guidance, failing to exploit the dynamic internal signals generated during
inference. To address these issues, we propose AdaptInfer, a plug-and-play
framework for adaptive vision token pruning in VLMs. First, we introduce a
fine-grained, dynamic text-guided pruning mechanism that reuses layer-wise
text-to-text attention maps to construct soft priors over text-token
importance, allowing more informed scoring of vision tokens at each stage.
Second, we perform an offline analysis of cross-modal attention shifts and
identify consistent inflection locations in inference, which inspire us to
propose a more principled and efficient pruning schedule. Our method is
lightweight and plug-and-play, also generalizable across multi-modal tasks.

TL;DR: Q-CLIP是一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的视频质量评估框架，通过共享跨模态适配器（SCMA）和可学习质量提示提升性能，显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频质量评估方法依赖大规模预训练，但存在语义知识迁移不足和计算资源消耗大的问题。

Method: 提出Q-CLIP框架，利用SCMA增强视觉和文本表示，引入可学习质量提示，并探索帧采样策略。

Result: Q-CLIP在多个VQA数据集上表现优异，计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: Q-CLIP为视频质量评估提供了一种高效且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient Video Quality Assessment (VQA) has long been a key
research challenge. Current mainstream VQA methods typically improve
performance by pretraining on large-scale classification datasets (e.g.,
ImageNet, Kinetics-400), followed by fine-tuning on VQA datasets. However, this
strategy presents two significant challenges: (1) merely transferring semantic
knowledge learned from pretraining is insufficient for VQA, as video quality
depends on multiple factors (e.g., semantics, distortion, motion, aesthetics);
(2) pretraining on large-scale datasets demands enormous computational
resources, often dozens or even hundreds of times greater than training
directly on VQA datasets. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown
remarkable generalization capabilities across a wide range of visual tasks, and
have begun to demonstrate promising potential in quality assessment. In this
work, we propose Q-CLIP, the first fully VLMs-based framework for VQA. Q-CLIP
enhances both visual and textual representations through a Shared Cross-Modal
Adapter (SCMA), which contains only a minimal number of trainable parameters
and is the only component that requires training. This design significantly
reduces computational cost. In addition, we introduce a set of five learnable
quality-level prompts to guide the VLMs in perceiving subtle quality
variations, thereby further enhancing the model's sensitivity to video quality.
Furthermore, we investigate the impact of different frame sampling strategies
on VQA performance, and find that frame-difference-based sampling leads to
better generalization performance across datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Q-CLIP exhibits excellent performance on several VQA datasets.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在反应动作生成任务上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能生成多样且自然的反应动作，适用于交互任务。

Abstract: Emotion serves as an essential component in daily human interactions.
Existing human motion generation frameworks do not consider the impact of
emotions, which reduces naturalness and limits their application in interactive
tasks, such as human reaction synthesis. In this work, we introduce a novel
task: generating diverse reaction motions in response to different emotional
cues. However, learning emotion representation from limited motion data and
incorporating it into a motion generation framework remains a challenging
problem. To address the above obstacles, we introduce a semi-supervised emotion
prior in an actor-reactor diffusion model to facilitate emotion-driven reaction
synthesis. Specifically, based on the observation that motion clips within a
short sequence tend to share the same emotion, we first devise a
semi-supervised learning framework to train an emotion prior. With this prior,
we further train an actor-reactor diffusion model to generate reactions by
considering both spatial interaction and emotional response. Finally, given a
motion sequence of an actor, our approach can generate realistic reactions
under various emotional conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
model outperforms existing reaction generation methods. The code and data will
be made publicly available at https://ereact.github.io/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字时代中图像编辑工具的普及威胁了视觉内容的真实性，而现有IML方法依赖大规模标注数据，但数据集规模不足且多样性有限，限制了模型性能。

Method: 提出UGD-IML框架，利用扩散模型学习数据分布，通过类别嵌入机制和参数共享设计，实现IML和CIML任务的无缝切换。

Result: 在多个数据集上，UGD-IML在IML和CIML任务中的F1指标分别平均优于现有方法9.66和4.36。

Conclusion: UGD-IML不仅性能优越，还在不确定性估计、可视化和鲁棒性方面表现出色，为图像伪造检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In the digital age, advanced image editing tools pose a serious threat to the
integrity of visual content, making image forgery detection and localization a
key research focus. Most existing Image Manipulation Localization (IML) methods
rely on discriminative learning and require large, high-quality annotated
datasets. However, current datasets lack sufficient scale and diversity,
limiting model performance in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, recent
studies have explored Constrained IML (CIML), which generates pixel-level
annotations through algorithmic supervision. However, existing CIML approaches
often depend on complex multi-stage pipelines, making the annotation process
inefficient. In this work, we propose a novel generative framework based on
diffusion models, named UGD-IML, which for the first time unifies both IML and
CIML tasks within a single framework. By learning the underlying data
distribution, generative diffusion models inherently reduce the reliance on
large-scale labeled datasets, allowing our approach to perform effectively even
under limited data conditions. In addition, by leveraging a class embedding
mechanism and a parameter-sharing design, our model seamlessly switches between
IML and CIML modes without extra components or training overhead. Furthermore,
the end-to-end design enables our model to avoid cumbersome steps in the data
annotation process. Extensive experimental results on multiple datasets
demonstrate that UGD-IML outperforms the SOTA methods by an average of 9.66 and
4.36 in terms of F1 metrics for IML and CIML tasks, respectively. Moreover, the
proposed method also excels in uncertainty estimation, visualization and
robustness.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理噪声标签时容易过拟合，且缺乏跨模态一致性，因此需要一种更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 提出多模态联合标签校正（MJC）机制和多层次自适应对齐（MAA）策略，以优化标签和特征对齐。

Result: MCA在传统和噪声3D基准测试中均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: MCA框架具有通用性和有效性，显著提升了跨模态检索的鲁棒性。

Abstract: With the increasing availability of 2D and 3D data, significant advancements
have been made in the field of cross-modal retrieval. Nevertheless, the
existence of imperfect annotations presents considerable challenges, demanding
robust solutions for 2D-3D cross-modal retrieval in the presence of noisy label
conditions. Existing methods generally address the issue of noise by dividing
samples independently within each modality, making them susceptible to
overfitting on corrupted labels. To address these issues, we propose a robust
2D-3D \textbf{M}ulti-level cross-modal adaptive \textbf{C}orrection and
\textbf{A}lignment framework (MCA). Specifically, we introduce a Multimodal
Joint label Correction (MJC) mechanism that leverages multimodal historical
self-predictions to jointly model the modality prediction consistency, enabling
reliable label refinement. Additionally, we propose a Multi-level Adaptive
Alignment (MAA) strategy to effectively enhance cross-modal feature semantics
and discrimination across different levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of our method, MCA, which achieves state-of-the-art performance
on both conventional and realistic noisy 3D benchmarks, highlighting its
generality and effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手写数学表达式识别因二维结构、符号尺度变化和复杂空间关系而具有挑战性，现有方法依赖标注数据，成本高。

Method: 结合全局和局部对比损失预训练图像编码器，提出自监督注意力网络，采用渐进空间掩码策略学习语义区域。

Result: 在CROHME基准测试中表现优于现有自监督和全监督基线方法。

Conclusion: 渐进注意力机制显著提升HMER性能，自监督框架有效减少对标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Recognizing handwritten mathematical expressions (HMER) is a challenging task
due to the inherent two-dimensional structure, varying symbol scales, and
complex spatial relationships among symbols. In this paper, we present a
self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for HMER that eliminates the need for
expensive labeled data. Our approach begins by pretraining an image encoder
using a combination of global and local contrastive loss, enabling the model to
learn both holistic and fine-grained representations. A key contribution of
this work is a novel self-supervised attention network, which is trained using
a progressive spatial masking strategy. This attention mechanism is designed to
learn semantically meaningful focus regions, such as operators, exponents, and
nested mathematical notation, without requiring any supervision. The
progressive masking curriculum encourages the network to become increasingly
robust to missing or occluded visual information, ultimately improving
structural understanding. Our complete pipeline consists of (1) self-supervised
pretraining of the encoder, (2) self-supervised attention learning, and (3)
supervised fine-tuning with a transformer decoder to generate LATEX sequences.
Extensive experiments on CROHME benchmarks demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing SSL and fully supervised baselines, validating the
effectiveness of our progressive attention mechanism in enhancing HMER
performance. Our codebase can be found here.

Motivation: 现有开源MLLMs在图表理解任务上的成功率仅为30%-50%，且合成图表与真实图表的差异限制了模型性能。

Method: 设计了五步数据合成流程，包括模块化图表生成、视觉多样化、数据过滤和GPT-4生成的QA对，构建了包含10k+图表和300k+QA对的ECD数据集。

Result: ECD显著提升了多种MLLMs在真实和合成测试集上的性能。

Conclusion: 模块化和多样化的图表生成方法有效提升了MLLMs的图表理解能力，ECD数据集为相关研究提供了高质量资源。

Abstract: Being able to effectively read scientific plots, or chart understanding, is a
central part toward building effective agents for science. However, existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially open-source ones, are
still falling behind with a typical success rate of 30%-50% on challenging
benchmarks. Previous studies on fine-tuning MLLMs with synthetic charts are
often restricted by their inadequate similarity to the real charts, which could
compromise model training and performance on complex real-world charts. In this
study, we show that modularizing chart generation and diversifying visual
details improves chart understanding capabilities. In particular, we design a
five-step data synthesis pipeline, where we separate data and function creation
for single plot generation, condition the generation of later subplots on
earlier ones for multi-subplot figures, visually diversify the generated
figures, filter out low quality data, and finally generate the question-answer
(QA) pairs with GPT-4o. This approach allows us to streamline the generation of
fine-tuning datasets and introduce the effective chart dataset (ECD), which
contains 10k+ chart images and 300k+ QA pairs, covering 25 topics and featuring
250+ chart type combinations with high visual complexity. We show that ECD
consistently improves the performance of various MLLMs on a range of real-world
and synthetic test sets. Code, data and models are available at:

TL;DR: FMCE-Net++是一种新的训练框架，通过结合FMCS预测和任务标签，动态优化模型性能，无需架构修改或额外数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DNN内部表示不透明的问题，FMCE缺乏实验验证和闭环集成。

Method: 提出FMCE-Net++框架，集成预训练的FMCE-Net作为辅助头，生成FMCS预测，并通过表示辅助损失（RAL）动态平衡分类损失和特征收敛优化。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，FMCE-Net++显著提升模型性能，如ResNet-50/CIFAR-10准确率提升1.16个百分点。

Conclusion: FMCE-Net++有效提升模型性能，验证了其作为辅助训练框架的潜力。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) face interpretability challenges due to their
opaque internal representations. While Feature Map Convergence Evaluation
(FMCE) quantifies module-level convergence via Feature Map Convergence Scores
(FMCS), it lacks experimental validation and closed-loop integration. To
address this limitation, we propose FMCE-Net++, a novel training framework that
integrates a pretrained, frozen FMCE-Net as an auxiliary head. This module
generates FMCS predictions, which, combined with task labels, jointly supervise
backbone optimization through a Representation Auxiliary Loss. The RAL
dynamically balances the primary classification loss and feature convergence
optimization via a tunable \Representation Abstraction Factor. Extensive
experiments conducted on MNIST, CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-100
demonstrate that FMCE-Net++ consistently enhances model performance without
architectural modifications or additional data. Key experimental outcomes
include accuracy gains of $+1.16$ pp (ResNet-50/CIFAR-10) and $+1.08$ pp
(ShuffleNet v2/CIFAR-100), validating that FMCE-Net++ can effectively elevate
state-of-the-art performance ceilings.

TL;DR: GMF-Drive提出了一种基于门控Mamba融合的端到端自动驾驶框架，解决了基于Transformer的融合方法的计算复杂性和空间建模不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer的融合方法在自动驾驶中存在计算复杂度高和缺乏空间先验的问题，限制了高分辨率特征的使用和BEV表示的有效建模。

Method: 1. 使用几何增强的柱状格式替代直方图LiDAR表示；2. 提出分层门控Mamba融合（GM-Fusion）架构，用高效的空间感知状态空间模型（SSM）替代Transformer。

Result: 在NAVSIM基准测试中，GMF-Drive性能显著优于DiffusionDrive，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: 任务特定的SSM在自动驾驶中性能和效率上均优于通用Transformer。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models are redefining the state-of-the-art in end-to-end
autonomous driving, yet their performance is increasingly hampered by a
reliance on transformer-based fusion. These architectures face fundamental
limitations: quadratic computational complexity restricts the use of
high-resolution features, and a lack of spatial priors prevents them from
effectively modeling the inherent structure of Bird's Eye View (BEV)
representations. This paper introduces GMF-Drive (Gated Mamba Fusion for
Driving), an end-to-end framework that overcomes these challenges through two
principled innovations. First, we supersede the information-limited
histogram-based LiDAR representation with a geometrically-augmented pillar
format encoding shape descriptors and statistical features, preserving critical
3D geometric details. Second, we propose a novel hierarchical gated mamba
fusion (GM-Fusion) architecture that substitutes an expensive transformer with
a highly efficient, spatially-aware state-space model (SSM). Our core BEV-SSM
leverages directional sequencing and adaptive fusion mechanisms to capture
long-range dependencies with linear complexity, while explicitly respecting the
unique spatial properties of the driving scene. Extensive experiments on the
challenging NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate that GMF-Drive achieves a new
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming DiffusionDrive.
Comprehensive ablation studies validate the efficacy of each component,
demonstrating that task-specific SSMs can surpass a general-purpose transformer
in both performance and efficiency for autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放词汇语义分割面临语义类别广泛且细粒度的挑战，现有弱监督方法因依赖类别特定监督和不适合的特征构建方法导致语义不对齐和性能不佳。

Method: SynSeg采用MCCL策略结合类别内和类别间对齐与分离，并通过FSS重构判别性特征，避免视觉编码器引入的前景偏差。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SynSeg表现优于现有方法，如在VOC上准确率提升4.5%，Context上提升8.9%。

Conclusion: SynSeg通过MCCL和FSS有效提升了弱监督下的语义定位和判别能力，实现了显著的性能改进。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in open-vocabulary scenarios presents significant
challenges due to the wide range and granularity of semantic categories.
Existing weakly-supervised methods often rely on category-specific supervision
and ill-suited feature construction methods for contrastive learning, leading
to semantic misalignment and poor performance. In this work, we propose a novel
weakly-supervised approach, SynSeg, to address the challenges. SynSeg performs
Multi-Category Contrastive Learning (MCCL) as a stronger training signal with a
new feature reconstruction framework named Feature Synergy Structure (FSS).
Specifically, MCCL strategy robustly combines both intra- and inter-category
alignment and separation in order to make the model learn the knowledge of
correlations from different categories within the same image. Moreover, FSS
reconstructs discriminative features for contrastive learning through prior
fusion and semantic-activation-map enhancement, effectively avoiding the
foreground bias introduced by the visual encoder. In general, SynSeg
effectively improves the abilities in semantic localization and discrimination
under weak supervision. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. For instance,
SynSeg achieves higher accuracy than SOTA baselines by 4.5\% on VOC, 8.9\% on
Context, 2.6\% on Object and 2.0\% on City.

Method: 使用PCA、CAE和预训练残差网络（PT）学习卫星图像的潜在空间，并通过分类任务评估其性能。

Result: CAE在所有分类任务中表现最优，PCA命中率高但误报率高，PT在热带气旋识别中表现突出但其他任务较差。高分辨率数据集对深度学习算法更有利。

Conclusion: CAE高效但缺乏物理可解释性，未来可开发物理信息版本的CAE以改进。

Abstract: This study applied representation learning algorithms to satellite images and
evaluated the learned latent spaces with classifications of various weather
events. The algorithms investigated include the classical linear
transformation, i.e., principal component analysis (PCA), state-of-the-art deep
learning method, i.e., convolutional autoencoder (CAE), and a residual network
pre-trained with large image datasets (PT). The experiment results indicated
that the latent space learned by CAE consistently showed higher threat scores
for all classification tasks. The classifications with PCA yielded high hit
rates but also high false-alarm rates. In addition, the PT performed
exceptionally well at recognizing tropical cyclones but was inferior in other
tasks. Further experiments suggested that representations learned from
higher-resolution datasets are superior in all classification tasks for
deep-learning algorithms, i.e., CAE and PT. We also found that smaller latent
space sizes had minor impact on the classification task's hit rate. Still, a
latent space dimension smaller than 128 caused a significantly higher false
alarm rate. Though the CAE can learn latent spaces effectively and efficiently,
the interpretation of the learned representation lacks direct connections to
physical attributions. Therefore, developing a physics-informed version of CAE
can be a promising outlook for the current work.

Conclusion: SC-Captioner通过强化学习框架和精细奖励设计，有效提升了图像描述的准确性和质量。

Abstract: We propose SC-Captioner, a reinforcement learning framework that enables the
self-correcting capability of image caption models. Our crucial technique lies
in the design of the reward function to incentivize accurate caption
corrections. Specifically, the predicted and reference captions are decomposed
into object, attribute, and relation sets using scene-graph parsing algorithms.
We calculate the set difference between sets of initial and self-corrected
captions to identify added and removed elements. These elements are matched
against the reference sets to calculate correctness bonuses for accurate
refinements and mistake punishments for wrong additions and removals, thereby
forming the final reward. For image caption quality assessment, we propose a
set of metrics refined from CAPTURE that alleviate its incomplete precision
evaluation and inefficient relation matching problems. Furthermore, we collect
a fine-grained annotated image caption dataset, RefinedCaps, consisting of 6.5K
diverse images from COCO dataset. Experiments show that applying SC-Captioner
on large visual-language models can generate better image captions across
various scenarios, significantly outperforming the direct preference
optimization training strategy.

Method: 使用参数化单纯复形和顶点细化迭代，结合轻量级域适应策略。

Result: VeSCA性能提升12.7%，在多个下游模型和数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: SAM的漏洞对下游模型构成风险，需开发更鲁棒的基础模型。

Abstract: While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) transforms interactive segmentation
with zero-shot abilities, its inherent vulnerabilities present a single-point
risk, potentially leading to the failure of numerous downstream applications.
Proactively evaluating these transferable vulnerabilities is thus imperative.
Prior adversarial attacks on SAM often present limited transferability due to
insufficient exploration of common weakness across domains. To address this, we
propose Vertex-Refining Simplicial Complex Attack (VeSCA), a novel method that
leverages only the encoder of SAM for generating transferable adversarial
examples. Specifically, it achieves this by explicitly characterizing the
shared vulnerable regions between SAM and downstream models through a
parametric simplicial complex. Our goal is to identify such complexes within
adversarially potent regions by iterative vertex-wise refinement. A lightweight
domain re-adaptation strategy is introduced to bridge domain divergence using
minimal reference data during the initialization of simplicial complex.
Ultimately, VeSCA generates consistently transferable adversarial examples
through random simplicial complex sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VeSCA achieves performance improved by 12.7% compared to state-of-the-art
methods across three downstream model categories across five domain-specific
datasets. Our findings further highlight the downstream model risks posed by
SAM's vulnerabilities and emphasize the urgency of developing more robust
foundation models.

Abstract: We propose a novel 3D gaze redirection framework that leverages an explicit
3D eyeball structure. Existing gaze redirection methods are typically based on
neural radiance fields, which employ implicit neural representations via volume
rendering. Unlike these NeRF-based approaches, where the rotation and
translation of 3D representations are not explicitly modeled, we introduce a
dedicated 3D eyeball structure to represent the eyeballs with 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS). Our method generates photorealistic images that faithfully
reproduce the desired gaze direction by explicitly rotating and translating the
3D eyeball structure. In addition, we propose an adaptive deformation module
that enables the replication of subtle muscle movements around the eyes.
Through experiments conducted on the ETH-XGaze dataset, we demonstrate that our
framework is capable of generating diverse novel gaze images, achieving
superior image quality and gaze estimation accuracy compared to previous
state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效融合了两种信号，解决了视觉信息退化问题，同时充分利用了IMU的时序信息。

Abstract: Combining sparse IMUs and a monocular camera is a new promising setting to
perform real-time human motion capture. This paper proposes a diffusion-based
solution to learn human motion priors and fuse the two modalities of signals
together seamlessly in a unified framework. By delicately considering the
characteristics of the two signals, the sequential visual information is
considered as a whole and transformed into a condition embedding, while the
inertial measurement is concatenated with the noisy body pose frame by frame to
construct a sequential input for the diffusion model. Firstly, we observe that
the visual information may be unavailable in some frames due to occlusions or
subjects moving out of the camera view. Thus incorporating the sequential
visual features as a whole to get a single feature embedding is robust to the
occasional degenerations of visual information in those frames. On the other
hand, the IMU measurements are robust to occlusions and always stable when
signal transmission has no problem. So incorporating them frame-wisely could
better explore the temporal information for the system. Experiments have
demonstrated the effectiveness of the system design and its state-of-the-art
performance in pose estimation compared with the previous works. Our codes are

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), the safety concerns of their outputs have earned significant
attention. Although numerous datasets have been proposed, they may become
outdated with MLLM advancements and are susceptible to data contamination
issues. To address these problems, we propose \textbf{SDEval}, the
\textit{first} safety dynamic evaluation framework to controllably adjust the
distribution and complexity of safety benchmarks. Specifically, SDEval mainly
adopts three dynamic strategies: text, image, and text-image dynamics to
generate new samples from original benchmarks. We first explore the individual
effects of text and image dynamics on model safety. Then, we find that
injecting text dynamics into images can further impact safety, and conversely,
injecting image dynamics into text also leads to safety risks. SDEval is
general enough to be applied to various existing safety and even capability
benchmarks. Experiments across safety benchmarks, MLLMGuard and VLSBench, and
capability benchmarks, MMBench and MMVet, show that SDEval significantly
influences safety evaluation, mitigates data contamination, and exposes safety
limitations of MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/hq-King/SDEval

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal vision models have highlighted limitations
in late-stage feature fusion and suboptimal query selection for hybrid prompts
open-world segmentation, alongside constraints from caption-derived
vocabularies. To address these challenges, we propose Prompt-DINO, a
text-guided visual Prompt DINO framework featuring three key innovations.
First, we introduce an early fusion mechanism that unifies text/visual prompts
and backbone features at the initial encoding stage, enabling deeper
cross-modal interactions to resolve semantic ambiguities. Second, we design
order-aligned query selection for DETR-based architectures, explicitly
optimizing the structural alignment between text and visual queries during
decoding to enhance semantic-spatial consistency. Third, we develop a
generative data engine powered by the Recognize Anything via Prompting (RAP)
model, which synthesizes 0.5B diverse training instances through a dual-path
cross-verification pipeline, reducing label noise by 80.5% compared to
conventional approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Prompt-DINO
achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-world detection benchmarks while
significantly expanding semantic coverage beyond fixed-vocabulary constraints.
Our work establishes a new paradigm for scalable multimodal detection and data
generation in open-world scenarios. Data&Code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下3D重建因光线吸收、散射和浑浊问题导致传统方法（如NeRF）效果不佳，现有扩展方法（如SeaThru-NeRF）效率低且分辨率受限。

Method: 提出基于3D高斯泼溅的框架，包含可学习的体素回归模块用于衰减和背散射建模，以及物理感知不确定性剪枝（PAUP）去除噪声高斯点。

Result: 在SeaThru-NeRF和UWBundle数据集上表现优异，PSNR达27.604，SSIM为0.868，LPIPS为0.104，浮动伪影减少约65%。

Conclusion: UW-3DGS通过结合物理模型和高斯泼溅技术，显著提升了水下3D重建的质量和效率。

Abstract: Underwater 3D scene reconstruction faces severe challenges from light
absorption, scattering, and turbidity, which degrade geometry and color
fidelity in traditional methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). While NeRF
extensions such as SeaThru-NeRF incorporate physics-based models, their MLP
reliance limits efficiency and spatial resolution in hazy environments. We
introduce UW-3DGS, a novel framework adapting 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for
robust underwater reconstruction. Key innovations include: (1) a plug-and-play
learnable underwater image formation module using voxel-based regression for
spatially varying attenuation and backscatter; and (2) a Physics-Aware
Uncertainty Pruning (PAUP) branch that adaptively removes noisy floating
Gaussians via uncertainty scoring, ensuring artifact-free geometry. The
pipeline operates in training and rendering stages. During training, noisy
Gaussians are optimized end-to-end with underwater parameters, guided by PAUP
pruning and scattering modeling. In rendering, refined Gaussians produce clean
Unattenuated Radiance Images (URIs) free from media effects, while learned
physics enable realistic Underwater Images (UWIs) with accurate light
transport. Experiments on SeaThru-NeRF and UWBundle datasets show superior
performance, achieving PSNR of 27.604, SSIM of 0.868, and LPIPS of 0.104 on
SeaThru-NeRF, with ~65% reduction in floating artifacts.

Result: DSConv在特征提取、泛化能力和优化效果上表现优异，实验证明其高效性和领先性能。

Conclusion: DSConv在图像融合任务中表现出色，具备优越性和最佳使用条件。

Abstract: Aiming to obtain a high-resolution image, pansharpening involves the fusion
of a multi-spectral image (MS) and a panchromatic image (PAN), the low-level
vision task remaining significant and challenging in contemporary research.
Most existing approaches rely predominantly on standard convolutions, few
making the effort to adaptive convolutions, which are effective owing to the
inter-pixel correlations of remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a
novel strategy for dynamically splitting convolution kernels in conjunction
with attention, selecting positions of interest, and splitting the original
convolution kernel into multiple smaller kernels, named DSConv. The proposed
DSConv more effectively extracts features of different positions within the
receptive field, enhancing the network's generalization, optimization, and
feature representation capabilities. Furthermore, we innovate and enrich
concepts of dynamic splitting convolution and provide a novel network
architecture for pansharpening capable of achieving the tasks more efficiently,
building upon this methodology. Adequate fair experiments illustrate the
effectiveness and the state-of-the-art performance attained by
DSConv.Comprehensive and rigorous discussions proved the superiority and
optimal usage conditions of DSConv.

Motivation: 解决现有T2I评估指标的局限性，提供更全面的评估方法。

Method: 采用两阶段混合范式：确定性指标评估物理可量化属性，HWPQ方案评估抽象语义。基于专家研究定义用户角色和评估角度。

Abstract: We present VISTAR, a user-centric, multi-dimensional benchmark for
text-to-image (T2I) evaluation that addresses the limitations of existing
metrics. VISTAR introduces a two-tier hybrid paradigm: it employs
deterministic, scriptable metrics for physically quantifiable attributes (e.g.,
text rendering, lighting) and a novel Hierarchical Weighted P/N Questioning
(HWPQ) scheme that uses constrained vision-language models to assess abstract
semantics (e.g., style fusion, cultural fidelity). Grounded in a Delphi study
with 120 experts, we defined seven user roles and nine evaluation angles to
construct the benchmark, which comprises 2,845 prompts validated by over 15,000
human pairwise comparisons. Our metrics achieve high human alignment (>75%),
with the HWPQ scheme reaching 85.9% accuracy on abstract semantics,
significantly outperforming VQA baselines. Comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art models reveals no universal champion, as role-weighted scores
reorder rankings and provide actionable guidance for domain-specific
deployment. All resources are publicly released to foster reproducible T2I
assessment.

Result: 在ADNI数据集上表现优异，并发现AD进展中右脑皮层结构变化的侧化不对称性。

Conclusion: MPF-KANSC显著提升AD诊断性能，并具有良好可解释性。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that
severely impairs cognitive function and quality of life. Timely intervention in
AD relies heavily on early and precise diagnosis, which remains challenging due
to the complex and subtle structural changes in the brain. Most existing deep
learning methods focus only on a single plane of structural magnetic resonance
imaging (sMRI) and struggle to accurately capture the complex and nonlinear
relationships among pathological regions of the brain, thus limiting their
ability to precisely identify atrophic features. To overcome these limitations,
we propose an innovative framework, MPF-KANSC, which integrates multi-plane
fusion (MPF) for combining features from the coronal, sagittal, and axial
planes, and a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-guided spatial-channel attention
mechanism (KANSC) to more effectively learn and represent sMRI atrophy
features. Specifically, the proposed model enables parallel feature extraction
from multiple anatomical planes, thus capturing more comprehensive structural
information. The KANSC attention mechanism further leverages a more flexible
and accurate nonlinear function approximation technique, facilitating precise
identification and localization of disease-related abnormalities. Experiments
on the ADNI dataset confirm that the proposed MPF-KANSC achieves superior
performance in AD diagnosis. Moreover, our findings provide new evidence of
right-lateralized asymmetry in subcortical structural changes during AD
progression, highlighting the model's promising interpretability.

Result: 实验表明，PostDiff显著提升了扩散模型的效率与保真度平衡，且降低单步推理成本比减少去噪步数更有效。

Conclusion: PostDiff为预训练扩散模型的高效部署提供了一种无需微调的解决方案，单步优化优于步数减少。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable success across generative tasks, yet
their high computational demands challenge deployment on resource-limited
platforms. This paper investigates a critical question for compute-optimal
diffusion model deployment: Under a post-training setting without fine-tuning,
is it more effective to reduce the number of denoising steps or to use a
cheaper per-step inference? Intuitively, reducing the number of denoising steps
increases the variability of the distributions across steps, making the model
more sensitive to compression. In contrast, keeping more denoising steps makes
the differences smaller, preserving redundancy, and making post-training
compression more feasible. To systematically examine this, we propose PostDiff,
a training-free framework for accelerating pre-trained diffusion models by
reducing redundancy at both the input level and module level in a post-training
manner. At the input level, we propose a mixed-resolution denoising scheme
based on the insight that reducing generation resolution in early denoising
steps can enhance low-frequency components and improve final generation
fidelity. At the module level, we employ a hybrid module caching strategy to
reuse computations across denoising steps. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies demonstrate that (1) PostDiff can significantly improve the
fidelity-efficiency trade-off of state-of-the-art diffusion models, and (2) to
boost efficiency while maintaining decent generation fidelity, reducing
per-step inference cost is often more effective than reducing the number of
denoising steps. Our code is available at

TL;DR: LiLoRA是一种高效架构扩展方法，用于解决多模态大语言模型在持续视觉指令调整中的灾难性遗忘问题，通过共享LoRA矩阵和低秩分解减少参数冗余，并引入余弦正则化稳定性损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续视觉指令调整（CVIT）中灾难性遗忘和参数效率低的问题需要解决。

Method: 提出LiLoRA方法，共享LoRA矩阵A，对矩阵B进行低秩分解以减少任务特定参数，并引入余弦正则化稳定性损失。

Result: 实验表明，LiLoRA在连续任务学习中表现优异，且参数效率显著提升。

Conclusion: LiLoRA为CVIT提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Continual Visual Instruction Tuning (CVIT) enables Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) to incrementally learn new tasks over time. However, this
process is challenged by catastrophic forgetting, where performance on
previously learned tasks deteriorates as the model adapts to new ones. A common
approach to mitigate forgetting is architecture expansion, which introduces
task-specific modules to prevent interference. Yet, existing methods often
expand entire layers for each task, leading to significant parameter overhead
and poor scalability. To overcome these issues, we introduce LoRA in LoRA
(LiLoRA), a highly efficient architecture expansion method tailored for CVIT in
MLLMs. LiLoRA shares the LoRA matrix A across tasks to reduce redundancy,
applies an additional low-rank decomposition to matrix B to minimize
task-specific parameters, and incorporates a cosine-regularized stability loss
to preserve consistency in shared representations over time. Extensive
experiments on a diverse CVIT benchmark show that LiLoRA consistently achieves
superior performance in sequential task learning while significantly improving
parameter efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Result: 在经典（DomainNet）和复杂（GeoNet）域偏移任务中表现优异，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: TRUST通过语言模态的鲁棒性和创新的不确定性估计策略，显著提升了无监督域自适应的性能。

Abstract: Recent unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have shown great success
in addressing classical domain shifts (e.g., synthetic-to-real), but they still
suffer under complex shifts (e.g. geographical shift), where both the
background and object appearances differ significantly across domains. Prior
works showed that the language modality can help in the adaptation process,
exhibiting more robustness to such complex shifts. In this paper, we introduce
TRUST, a novel UDA approach that exploits the robustness of the language
modality to guide the adaptation of a vision model. TRUST generates
pseudo-labels for target samples from their captions and introduces a novel
uncertainty estimation strategy that uses normalised CLIP similarity scores to
estimate the uncertainty of the generated pseudo-labels. Such estimated
uncertainty is then used to reweight the classification loss, mitigating the
adverse effects of wrong pseudo-labels obtained from low-quality captions. To
further increase the robustness of the vision model, we propose a multimodal
soft-contrastive learning loss that aligns the vision and language feature
spaces, by leveraging captions to guide the contrastive training of the vision
model on target images. In our contrastive loss, each pair of images acts as
both a positive and a negative pair and their feature representations are
attracted and repulsed with a strength proportional to the similarity of their
captions. This solution avoids the need for hardly determining positive and
negative pairs, which is critical in the UDA setting. Our approach outperforms
previous methods, setting the new state-of-the-art on classical (DomainNet) and
complex (GeoNet) domain shifts. The code will be available upon acceptance.

Conclusion: MA-CBP为城市公共安全风险预警提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the acceleration of urbanization, criminal behavior in public scenes
poses an increasingly serious threat to social security. Traditional anomaly
detection methods based on feature recognition struggle to capture high-level
behavioral semantics from historical information, while generative approaches
based on Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to meet real-time
requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MA-CBP, a criminal
behavior prediction framework based on multi-agent asynchronous collaboration.
This framework transforms real-time video streams into frame-level semantic
descriptions, constructs causally consistent historical summaries, and fuses
adjacent image frames to perform joint reasoning over long- and short-term
contexts. The resulting behavioral decisions include key elements such as event
subjects, locations, and causes, enabling early warning of potential criminal
activity. In addition, we construct a high-quality criminal behavior dataset
that provides multi-scale language supervision, including frame-level,
summary-level, and event-level semantic annotations. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on multiple datasets
and offers a promising solution for risk warning in urban public safety
scenarios.

Conclusion: WGAST能够有效捕捉精细尺度的热模式，并对云干扰具有鲁棒性，为高分辨率LST估计提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Urbanization, climate change, and agricultural stress are increasing the
demand for precise and timely environmental monitoring. Land Surface
Temperature (LST) is a key variable in this context and is retrieved from
remote sensing satellites. However, these systems face a trade-off between
spatial and temporal resolution. While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer
promising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m
resolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a Weakly-Supervised Generative
Network for Daily 10 m LST Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Terra
MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning
framework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative
adversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature
extraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage
employs a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from
the inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity,
normalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the
fused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to
suppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy
based on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN
discriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods
in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared to the
best-performing baseline, on average, WGAST reduces RMSE by 17.18% and improves
SSIM by 11.00%. Furthermore, WGAST is robust to cloud-induced LST and
effectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against 33
ground-based sensors. The code is available at

Conclusion: DBIF-AUNet显著优化了复杂胸水CT图像的分割精度，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Pleural effusion semantic segmentation can significantly enhance the accuracy
and timeliness of clinical diagnosis and treatment by precisely identifying
disease severity and lesion areas. Currently, semantic segmentation of pleural
effusion CT images faces multiple challenges. These include similar gray levels
between effusion and surrounding tissues, blurred edges, and variable
morphology. Existing methods often struggle with diverse image variations and
complex edges, primarily because direct feature concatenation causes semantic
gaps. To address these challenges, we propose the Dual-Branch Interactive
Fusion Attention model (DBIF-AUNet). This model constructs a densely nested
skip-connection network and innovatively refines the Dual-Domain Feature
Disentanglement module (DDFD). The DDFD module orthogonally decouples the
functions of dual-domain modules to achieve multi-scale feature complementarity
and enhance characteristics at different levels. Concurrently, we design a
Branch Interaction Attention Fusion module (BIAF) that works synergistically
with the DDFD. This module dynamically weights and fuses global, local, and
frequency band features, thereby improving segmentation robustness.
Furthermore, we implement a nested deep supervision mechanism with hierarchical
adaptive hybrid loss to effectively address class imbalance. Through validation
on 1,622 pleural effusion CT images from Southwest Hospital, DBIF-AUNet
achieved IoU and Dice scores of 80.1% and 89.0% respectively. These results
outperform state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models U-Net++ and
Swin-UNet by 5.7%/2.7% and 2.2%/1.5% respectively, demonstrating significant
optimization in segmentation accuracy for complex pleural effusion CT images.

Result: 在8个跨领域数据集上，AnomalyMoE显著优于领域专用方法，达到新的最优性能。

Conclusion: AnomalyMoE通过分层设计和专家优化模块，实现了通用且高效的异常检测，为多模态异常检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a critical task across numerous domains and modalities,
yet existing methods are often highly specialized, limiting their
generalizability. These specialized models, tailored for specific anomaly types
like textural defects or logical errors, typically exhibit limited performance
when deployed outside their designated contexts. To overcome this limitation,
we propose AnomalyMoE, a novel and universal anomaly detection framework based
on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Our key insight is to decompose the
complex anomaly detection problem into three distinct semantic hierarchies:
local structural anomalies, component-level semantic anomalies, and global
logical anomalies. AnomalyMoE correspondingly employs three dedicated expert
networks at the patch, component, and global levels, and is specialized in
reconstructing features and identifying deviations at its designated semantic
level. This hierarchical design allows a single model to concurrently
understand and detect a wide spectrum of anomalies. Furthermore, we introduce
an Expert Information Repulsion (EIR) module to promote expert diversity and an
Expert Selection Balancing (ESB) module to ensure the comprehensive utilization
of all experts. Experiments on 8 challenging datasets spanning industrial
imaging, 3D point clouds, medical imaging, video surveillance, and logical
anomaly detection demonstrate that AnomalyMoE establishes new state-of-the-art
performance, significantly outperforming specialized methods in their
respective domains.

TL;DR: PA-HOI数据集填补了现有HOI数据集的不足，关注物体物理属性对人类长期运动的影响，包含562个动作序列，适用于运动生成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOI数据集多关注功能细节，忽略了物体物理属性对人类运动的影响，PA-HOI旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 收集了562个动作序列，涉及不同性别受试者与35种3D物体的互动，记录物体尺寸、形状和重量对运动的影响。

Result: PA-HOI数据集显著扩展了对物体物理属性如何影响人类姿势、速度和互动策略的理解。

Conclusion: PA-HOI数据集为运动生成方法提供了现实物理感知能力，验证了其应用潜力。

Abstract: The Human-Object Interaction (HOI) task explores the dynamic interactions
between humans and objects in physical environments, providing essential
biomechanical and cognitive-behavioral foundations for fields such as robotics,
virtual reality, and human-computer interaction. However, existing HOI data
sets focus on details of affordance, often neglecting the influence of physical
properties of objects on human long-term motion. To bridge this gap, we
introduce the PA-HOI Motion Capture dataset, which highlights the impact of
objects' physical attributes on human motion dynamics, including human posture,
moving velocity, and other motion characteristics. The dataset comprises 562
motion sequences of human-object interactions, with each sequence performed by
subjects of different genders interacting with 35 3D objects that vary in size,
shape, and weight. This dataset stands out by significantly extending the scope
of existing ones for understanding how the physical attributes of different
objects influence human posture, speed, motion scale, and interacting
strategies. We further demonstrate the applicability of the PA-HOI dataset by
integrating it with existing motion generation methods, validating its capacity
to transfer realistic physical awareness.

TL;DR: SIFThinker是一个空间感知的多模态框架，通过深度增强的边界框和自然语言交互，提升视觉任务中的注意力校正和区域聚焦能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在复杂视觉任务（如空间理解和细粒度感知）中表现不足，缺乏利用空间线索进行注意力校正的能力。

Method: 提出SIFThinker框架，采用反向扩展前向推理策略生成图像-文本链式思维，并构建SIF-50K数据集；引入GRPO-SIF训练范式，结合深度信息进行视觉定位。

Result: 实验表明，SIFThinker在空间理解和细粒度视觉感知任务中优于现有方法，同时保持通用能力。

Conclusion: SIFThinker通过动态注意力校正和区域聚焦，显著提升了复杂视觉任务的性能。

Abstract: Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still face significant
challenges in complex visual tasks (e.g., spatial understanding, fine-grained
perception). Prior methods have tried to incorporate visual reasoning, however,
they fail to leverage attention correction with spatial cues to iteratively
refine their focus on prompt-relevant regions. In this paper, we introduce
SIFThinker, a spatially-aware "think-with-images" framework that mimics human
visual perception. Specifically, SIFThinker enables attention correcting and
image region focusing by interleaving depth-enhanced bounding boxes and natural
language. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce a
reverse-expansion-forward-inference strategy that facilitates the generation of
interleaved image-text chains of thought for process-level supervision, which
in turn leads to the construction of the SIF-50K dataset. Besides, we propose
GRPO-SIF, a reinforced training paradigm that integrates depth-informed visual
grounding into a unified reasoning pipeline, teaching the model to dynamically
correct and focus on prompt-relevant regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SIFThinker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in spatial understanding
and fine-grained visual perception, while maintaining strong general
capabilities, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于双手X光片的可解释图像级SvdH评分预测方法，通过注意力机制的多实例学习整合疾病相关区域，实现了与经验丰富的放射科医生相当的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SvdH评分在临床实践中因复杂性而应用受限，手动评分效率低下，需开发自动化方法。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1）提取疾病相关图像区域；2）基于注意力机制的多实例学习生成图像级特征进行预测。提出了两种区域提取方案。

Result: 最佳模型PCC为0.943，RMSE为15.73；集成学习后PCC提升至0.945，RMSE降至15.57，性能接近放射科医生。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效识别RA进展相关的解剖结构，为临床实践提供了高效工具。

Abstract: The Sharp/van der Heijde (SvdH) score has been widely used in clinical trials
to quantify radiographic damage in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), but its
complexity has limited its adoption in routine clinical practice. To address
the inefficiency of manual scoring, this work proposes a two-stage pipeline for
interpretable image-level SvdH score prediction using dual-hand radiographs.
Our approach extracts disease-relevant image regions and integrates them using
attention-based multiple instance learning to generate image-level features for
prediction. We propose two region extraction schemes: 1) sampling image tiles
most likely to contain abnormalities, and 2) cropping patches containing
disease-relevant joints. With Scheme 2, our best individual score prediction
model achieved a Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.943 and a root
mean squared error (RMSE) of 15.73. Ensemble learning further boosted
prediction accuracy, yielding a PCC of 0.945 and RMSE of 15.57, achieving
state-of-the-art performance that is comparable to that of experienced
radiologists (PCC = 0.97, RMSE = 18.75). Finally, our pipeline effectively
identified and made decisions based on anatomical structures which clinicians
consider relevant to RA progression.

TL;DR: 提出了一种纹理感知和边缘引导的Transformer（TEFormer），用于解决城市遥感图像语义分割中的纹理差异和边缘模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市遥感图像中地理对象的纹理差异小、空间结构相似，易导致语义模糊和误分类，同时不规则形状和模糊边界增加了分割难度。

Method: 设计了纹理感知模块（TaM）捕捉纹理差异，边缘引导三分支解码器（Eg3Head）保留边缘细节，以及边缘引导特征融合模块（EgFFM）融合上下文和边缘信息。

Result: 在Potsdam、Vaihingen和LoveDA数据集上分别达到88.57%、81.46%和53.55%的mIoU。

Conclusion: TEFormer通过纹理和边缘引导机制，有效提升了城市遥感图像的语义分割精度。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of urban remote sensing images (URSIs) is crucial for
applications such as urban planning and environmental monitoring. However,
geospatial objects often exhibit subtle texture differences and similar spatial
structures, which can easily lead to semantic ambiguity and misclassification.
Moreover, challenges such as irregular object shapes, blurred boundaries, and
overlapping spatial distributions of semantic objects contribute to complex and
diverse edge morphologies, further complicating accurate segmentation. To
tackle these issues, we propose a texture-aware and edge-guided Transformer
(TEFormer) that integrates texture awareness and edge-guidance mechanisms for
semantic segmentation of URSIs. In the encoder, a texture-aware module (TaM) is
designed to capture fine-grained texture differences between visually similar
categories to enhance semantic discrimination. Then, an edge-guided tri-branch
decoder (Eg3Head) is constructed to preserve local edges and details for
multiscale context-awareness. Finally, an edge-guided feature fusion module
(EgFFM) is to fuse contextual and detail information with edge information to
realize refined semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments show that TEFormer
achieves mIoU of 88.57%, 81.46%, and 53.55% on the Potsdam, Vaihingen, and
LoveDA datasets, respectively, shows the effectiveness in URSI semantic
segmentation.

Motivation: 传统数据增强方法忽略了深度感知变换，限制了模型在真实世界深度变化中的鲁棒性。

Method: Depth-Jitter通过自适应深度偏移（基于深度方差阈值）生成合成深度扰动，同时保持结构完整性。

Result: 在FathomNet和UTDAC2020数据集上的实验表明，Depth-Jitter能提升模型在深度变化下的稳定性，但未必在绝对性能上超越传统方法。

Conclusion: Depth-Jitter为深度感知增强提供了新思路，支持进一步研究深度相关学习策略，代码已开源。

Abstract: Depth information is essential in computer vision, particularly in underwater
imaging, robotics, and autonomous navigation. However, conventional
augmentation techniques overlook depth aware transformations, limiting model
robustness in real world depth variations. In this paper, we introduce
Depth-Jitter, a novel depth-based augmentation technique that simulates natural
depth variations to improve generalization. Our approach applies adaptive depth
offsetting, guided by depth variance thresholds, to generate synthetic depth
perturbations while preserving structural integrity. We evaluate Depth-Jitter
on two benchmark datasets, FathomNet and UTDAC2020 demonstrating its impact on
model stability under diverse depth conditions. Extensive experiments compare
Depth-Jitter against traditional augmentation strategies such as ColorJitter,
analyzing performance across varying learning rates, encoders, and loss
functions. While Depth-Jitter does not always outperform conventional methods
in absolute performance, it consistently enhances model stability and
generalization in depth-sensitive environments. These findings highlight the
potential of depth-aware augmentation for real-world applications and provide a
foundation for further research into depth-based learning strategies. The
proposed technique is publicly available to support advancements in depth-aware
augmentation. The code is publicly available on

Result: 方法性能与专用模型相当，对未见模糊场景表现出强鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出了一种高效、通用的图像去模糊方法，解决了现有技术的局限性。

Abstract: Image deblurring, removing blurring artifacts from images, is a fundamental
task in computational photography and low-level computer vision. Existing
approaches focus on specialized solutions tailored to particular blur types,
thus, these solutions lack generalization. This limitation in current methods
implies requiring multiple models to cover several blur types, which is not
practical in many real scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the first
all-in-one deblurring method capable of efficiently restoring images affected
by diverse blur degradations, including global motion, local motion, blur in
low-light conditions, and defocus blur. We propose a mixture-of-experts (MoE)
decoding module, which dynamically routes image features based on the
recognized blur degradation, enabling precise and efficient restoration in an
end-to-end manner. Our unified approach not only achieves performance
comparable to dedicated task-specific models, but also demonstrates remarkable
robustness and generalization capabilities on unseen blur degradation
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有弱监督视频异常检测模型在处理复杂异常时表现不佳，主要因为模型无法区分异常类型且弱监督信号缺乏精确时序信息。

Method: GS-MoE采用多个专家模型，每个专注于特定异常类型，并通过时序高斯损失增强弱监督。

Result: 在UCF-Crime数据集上达到91.58% AUC，并在XD-Violence和MSAD数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: GS-MoE通过类别特异性专家和时序指导，为弱监督视频异常检测设定了新基准。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is a challenging task due to the variability of
anomalous events and the limited availability of labeled data. Under the
Weakly-Supervised VAD (WSVAD) paradigm, only video-level labels are provided
during training, while predictions are made at the frame level. Although
state-of-the-art models perform well on simple anomalies (e.g., explosions),
they struggle with complex real-world events (e.g., shoplifting). This
difficulty stems from two key issues: (1) the inability of current models to
address the diversity of anomaly types, as they process all categories with a
shared model, overlooking category-specific features; and (2) the weak
supervision signal, which lacks precise temporal information, limiting the
ability to capture nuanced anomalous patterns blended with normal events. To
address these challenges, we propose Gaussian Splatting-guided Mixture of
Experts (GS-MoE), a novel framework that employs a set of expert models, each
specialized in capturing specific anomaly types. These experts are guided by a
temporal Gaussian splatting loss, enabling the model to leverage temporal
consistency and enhance weak supervision. The Gaussian splatting approach
encourages a more precise and comprehensive representation of anomalies by
focusing on temporal segments most likely to contain abnormal events. The
predictions from these specialized experts are integrated through a
mixture-of-experts mechanism to model complex relationships across diverse
anomaly patterns. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a
91.58% AUC on the UCF-Crime dataset, and demonstrates superior results on
XD-Violence and MSAD datasets. By leveraging category-specific expertise and
temporal guidance, GS-MoE sets a new benchmark for VAD under weak supervision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度伪造检测器在未见过的伪造技术上泛化能力不足的问题，避免引入复杂架构。

Method: 仅微调Layer Normalization参数（占总参数的0.03%），并通过L2归一化和潜在空间增强强制特征流形为超球面。

Result: 在13个基准数据集上取得最优性能，平均跨数据集AUROC超越复杂方法。发现训练数据配对和数据集多样性对泛化至关重要。

Conclusion: 通过最小化调整预训练CLIP模型，实现了高效且可复现的深度伪造检测方法。

Abstract: The generalization of deepfake detectors to unseen manipulation techniques
remains a challenge for practical deployment. Although many approaches adapt
foundation models by introducing significant architectural complexity, this
work demonstrates that robust generalization is achievable through a
parameter-efficient adaptation of a pre-trained CLIP vision encoder. The
proposed method, LNCLIP-DF, fine-tunes only the Layer Normalization parameters
(0.03% of the total) and enhances generalization by enforcing a hyperspherical
feature manifold using L2 normalization and latent space augmentations.
  We conducted an extensive evaluation on 13 benchmark datasets spanning from
2019 to 2025. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming more complex, recent approaches in average cross-dataset AUROC.
Our analysis yields two primary findings for the field: 1) training on paired
real-fake data from the same source video is essential for mitigating shortcut
learning and improving generalization, and 2) detection difficulty on academic
datasets has not strictly increased over time, with models trained on older,
diverse datasets showing strong generalization capabilities.
  This work delivers a computationally efficient and reproducible method,
proving that state-of-the-art generalization is attainable by making targeted,
minimal changes to a pre-trained CLIP model. The code will be made publicly
available upon acceptance.

Result: 在BigEarthNet-S2和EuroSAT数据集上验证，FedX显著减少参数数量并提升泛化能力。

Conclusion: FedX有效降低通信开销，优于未剪枝模型和现有剪枝方法。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables the collaborative training of deep neural
networks across decentralized data archives (i.e., clients), where each client
stores data locally and only shares model updates with a central server. This
makes FL a suitable learning paradigm for remote sensing (RS) image
classification tasks, where data centralization may be restricted due to legal
and privacy constraints. However, a key challenge in applying FL to RS tasks is
the communication overhead caused by the frequent exchange of large model
updates between clients and the central server. To address this issue, in this
paper we propose a novel strategy (denoted as FedX) that uses
explanation-guided pruning to reduce communication overhead by minimizing the
size of the transmitted models without compromising performance. FedX leverages
backpropagation-based explanation methods to estimate the task-specific
importance of model components and prunes the least relevant ones at the
central server. The resulting sparse global model is then sent to clients,
substantially reducing communication overhead. We evaluate FedX on multi-label
scene classification using the BigEarthNet-S2 dataset and single-label scene
classification using the EuroSAT dataset. Experimental results show the success
of FedX in significantly reducing the number of shared model parameters while
enhancing the generalization capability of the global model, compared to both
unpruned model and state-of-the-art pruning methods. The code of FedX will be
available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/FedX.

Conclusion: XAG-Net是一种高效且准确的股骨MRI分割框架，其核心模块CSA和AG对性能提升至关重要。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of femur structures from Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI) is critical for orthopedic diagnosis and surgical planning but remains
challenging due to the limitations of existing 2D and 3D deep learning-based
segmentation approaches. In this study, we propose XAG-Net, a novel 2.5D
U-Net-based architecture that incorporates pixel-wise cross-slice attention
(CSA) and skip attention gating (AG) mechanisms to enhance inter-slice
contextual modeling and intra-slice feature refinement. Unlike previous
CSA-based models, XAG-Net applies pixel-wise softmax attention across adjacent
slices at each spatial location for fine-grained inter-slice modeling.
Extensive evaluations demonstrate that XAG-Net surpasses baseline 2D, 2.5D, and
3D U-Net models in femur segmentation accuracy while maintaining computational
efficiency. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of the CSA and
AG modules, establishing XAG-Net as a promising framework for efficient and
accurate femur MRI segmentation.

Abstract: A central problem in one-to-many facial identification is that the person in
the probe image may or may not have enrolled image(s) in the gallery; that is,
may be In-gallery or Out-of-gallery. Past approaches to detect when a rank-one
result is Out-of-gallery have mostly focused on finding a suitable threshold on
the similarity score. We take a new approach, using the additional enrolled
images of the identity with the rank-one result to predict if the rank-one
result is In-gallery / Out-of-gallery. Given a gallery of identities and
images, we generate In-gallery and Out-of-gallery training data by extracting
the ranks of additional enrolled images corresponding to the rank-one identity.
We then train a classifier to utilize this feature vector to predict whether a
rank-one result is In-gallery or Out-of-gallery. Using two different datasets
and four different matchers, we present experimental results showing that our
approach is viable for mugshot quality probe images, and also, importantly, for
probes degraded by blur, reduced resolution, atmospheric turbulence and
sunglasses. We also analyze results across demographic groups, and show that
In-gallery / Out-of-gallery classification accuracy is similar across
demographics. Our approach has the potential to provide an objective estimate
of whether a one-to-many facial identification is Out-of-gallery, and thereby
to reduce false positive identifications, wrongful arrests, and wasted
investigative time. Interestingly, comparing the results of older deep
CNN-based face matchers with newer ones suggests that the effectiveness of our
Out-of-gallery detection approach emerges only with matchers trained using
advanced margin-based loss functions.

Result: 在三个数据集和六种跨域设置中，URPA仅需少量无标注视频即可实现良好泛化。

Conclusion: URPA无需目标域标注且计算高效，适用于实时部署，显著提升了跨域视频时间定位的实用性。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (TG) aims to temporally locate video segments
matching a natural language description (a query) in a long video. While
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are effective at holistic semantic matching, they
often struggle with fine-grained temporal localisation. Recently, Group
Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO) reformulates the inference process as a
reinforcement learning task, enabling fine-grained grounding and achieving
strong in-domain performance. However, GRPO relies on labelled data, making it
unsuitable in unlabelled domains. Moreover, because videos are large and
expensive to store and process, performing full-scale adaptation introduces
prohibitive latency and computational overhead, making it impractical for
real-time deployment. To overcome both problems, we introduce a Data-Efficient
Unlabelled Cross-domain Temporal Grounding method, from which a model is first
trained on a labelled source domain, then adapted to a target domain using only
a small number of unlabelled videos from the target domain. This approach
eliminates the need for target annotation and keeps both computational and
storage overhead low enough to run in real time. Specifically, we introduce.
Uncertainty-quantified Rollout Policy Adaptation (URPA) for cross-domain
knowledge transfer in learning video temporal grounding without target labels.
URPA generates multiple candidate predictions using GRPO rollouts, averages
them to form a pseudo label, and estimates confidence from the variance across
these rollouts. This confidence then weights the training rewards, guiding the
model to focus on reliable supervision. Experiments on three datasets across
six cross-domain settings show that URPA generalises well using only a few
unlabelled target videos. Codes will be released once published.

Result: 在未见目标域数据上，分割性能显著提升（Welch's t-test, p < 0.01）。

Conclusion: 该方法无需迁移学习或在线训练，有效解决域偏移问题，尤其适用于数据稀缺场景。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, including cardiac MR, is prone to domain
shift due to variations in imaging devices and acquisition protocols. This
challenge limits the deployment of trained AI models in real-world scenarios,
where performance degrades on unseen domains. Traditional solutions involve
increasing the size of the dataset through ad-hoc image augmentation or
additional online training/transfer learning, which have several limitations.
Synthetic data offers a promising alternative, but anatomical/structural
consistency constraints limit the effectiveness of generative models in
creating image-label pairs. To address this, we propose a diffusion model (DM)
trained on a source domain that generates synthetic cardiac MR images that
resemble a given reference. The synthetic data maintains spatial and structural
fidelity, ensuring similarity to the source domain and compatibility with the
segmentation mask. We assess the utility of our generative approach in
multi-centre cardiac MR segmentation, using the 2D nnU-Net, 3D nnU-Net and
vanilla U-Net segmentation networks. We explore domain generalisation, where,
domain-invariant segmentation models are trained on synthetic source domain
data, and domain adaptation, where, we shift target domain data towards the
source domain using the DM. Both strategies significantly improved segmentation
performance on data from an unseen target domain, in terms of surface-based
metrics (Welch's t-test, p < 0.01), compared to training segmentation models on
real data alone. The proposed method ameliorates the need for transfer learning
or online training to address domain shift challenges in cardiac MR image
analysis, especially useful in data-scarce settings.

*Patrick Takenaka,Johannes Maucher,Marco F. Huber*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 改进ViPro模型，使其能够从观测中正确推断状态，无需初始真实状态，并在无监督方式下实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ViPro模型因依赖初始真实状态而无法处理噪声观测的问题。

Method: 在ViPro基础上添加改进，使其能无监督地从观测推断状态，并扩展3D数据集。

Result: 模型能正确推断状态，适用于更接近真实世界的3D场景。

Conclusion: 改进后的ViPro模型在无监督状态下表现更优，适用于复杂动态环境。

Abstract: Predicting future video frames is a challenging task with many downstream
applications. Previous work has shown that procedural knowledge enables deep
models for complex dynamical settings, however their model ViPro assumed a
given ground truth initial symbolic state. We show that this approach led to
the model learning a shortcut that does not actually connect the observed
environment with the predicted symbolic state, resulting in the inability to
estimate states given an observation if previous states are noisy. In this
work, we add several improvements to ViPro that enables the model to correctly
infer states from observations without providing a full ground truth state in
the beginning. We show that this is possible in an unsupervised manner, and
extend the original Orbits dataset with a 3D variant to close the gap to real
world scenarios.

Result: 该方法在科学验证的图像质量指标上提升了图像质量，同时提高了分类准确性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，将分类目标融入超分辨率过程可以同时改善图像质量和分类性能。

Abstract: High-resolution imagery plays a critical role in improving the performance of
visual recognition tasks such as classification, detection, and segmentation.
In many domains, including remote sensing and surveillance, low-resolution
images can limit the accuracy of automated analysis. To address this,
super-resolution (SR) techniques have been widely adopted to attempt to
reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. Related
traditional approaches focus solely on enhancing image quality based on
pixel-level metrics, leaving the relationship between super-resolved image
fidelity and downstream classification performance largely underexplored. This
raises a key question: can integrating classification objectives directly into
the super-resolution process further improve classification accuracy? In this
paper, we try to respond to this question by investigating the relationship
between super-resolution and classification through the deployment of a
specialised algorithmic strategy. We propose a novel methodology that increases
the resolution of synthetic aperture radar imagery by optimising loss functions
that account for both image quality and classification performance. Our
approach improves image quality, as measured by scientifically ascertained
image quality indicators, while also enhancing classification accuracy.

*Kieran Elrod,Katherine Flanigan,Mario Bergés*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用街景图像和多模态大语言模型，结合社会学理论，量化分析城市街道的社会互动质量，验证其与城市环境变量和居民情感的联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注行人数量而非社会互动质量，街景图像作为低成本、全球覆盖的数据源，可能蕴含潜在社会信息。

Method: 分析15个城市的2,998张街景图像，结合Mehta的社会互动分类理论，使用线性回归模型控制多种变量。

Result: 天空视野指数与三种社会互动类型相关，绿色视野指数预测持久互动，居民情感与短暂互动正相关。

Conclusion: 街景图像可量化社会互动与建成环境的关系，为城市设计提供隐私保护的研究工具。

Abstract: Designing socially active streets has long been a goal of urban planning, yet
existing quantitative research largely measures pedestrian volume rather than
the quality of social interactions. We hypothesize that street view imagery --
an inexpensive data source with global coverage -- contains latent social
information that can be extracted and interpreted through established social
science theory. As a proof of concept, we analyzed 2,998 street view images
from 15 cities using a multimodal large language model guided by Mehta's
taxonomy of passive, fleeting, and enduring sociability -- one illustrative
example of a theory grounded in urban design that could be substituted or
complemented by other sociological frameworks. We then used linear regression
models, controlling for factors like weather, time of day, and pedestrian
counts, to test whether the inferred sociability measures correlate with
city-level place attachment scores from the World Values Survey and with
environmental predictors (e.g., green, sky, and water view indices) derived
from individual street view images. Results aligned with long-standing urban
planning theory: the sky view index was associated with all three sociability
types, the green view index predicted enduring sociability, and place
attachment was positively associated with fleeting sociability. These results
provide preliminary evidence that street view images can be used to infer
relationships between specific types of social interactions and built
environment variables. Further research could establish street view imagery as
a scalable, privacy-preserving tool for studying urban sociability, enabling
cross-cultural theory testing and evidence-based design of socially vibrant
cities.

*Guido Manni,Clemente Lauretti,Loredana Zollo,Paolo Soda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于GAN的半监督学习框架，专门针对医学影像中标签数据稀缺的问题，通过结合生成器、判别器和分类器，在极少量标签数据下显著提升了分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习中标签数据不足限制了医学影像的应用，尤其是在标签数据极少的场景下。

Method: 采用三阶段训练框架，结合生成器、判别器和分类器，利用图像翻译和集成伪标签技术。

Result: 在11个MedMNIST数据集上显著优于六种现有方法，尤其在5-shot场景下表现突出。

Conclusion: 该框架为标签成本高的医学影像应用提供了实用解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized medical imaging, but its effectiveness is
severely limited by insufficient labeled training data. This paper introduces a
novel GAN-based semi-supervised learning framework specifically designed for
low labeled-data regimes, evaluated across settings with 5 to 50 labeled
samples per class. Our approach integrates three specialized neural networks --
a generator for class-conditioned image translation, a discriminator for
authenticity assessment and classification, and a dedicated classifier --
within a three-phase training framework. The method alternates between
supervised training on limited labeled data and unsupervised learning that
leverages abundant unlabeled images through image-to-image translation rather
than generation from noise. We employ ensemble-based pseudo-labeling that
combines confidence-weighted predictions from the discriminator and classifier
with temporal consistency through exponential moving averaging, enabling
reliable label estimation for unlabeled data. Comprehensive evaluation across
eleven MedMNIST datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves statistically
significant improvements over six state-of-the-art GAN-based semi-supervised
methods, with particularly strong performance in the extreme 5-shot setting
where the scarcity of labeled data is most challenging. The framework maintains
its superiority across all evaluated settings (5, 10, 20, and 50 shots per
class). Our approach offers a practical solution for medical imaging
applications where annotation costs are prohibitive, enabling robust
classification performance even with minimal labeled data. Code is available at

TL;DR: VA-GPT是一种新型多模态大语言模型，专注于视频中异常事件的总结和定位，通过空间和时间有效令牌选择模块提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在处理视频异常事件时因冗余信息导致效果不佳，需改进其空间和时间稀疏性问题。

Method: 提出VA-GPT模型，包含空间有效令牌选择（SETS）和时间有效令牌生成（TETG）模块，并构建指令跟随数据集和跨域评估基准。

Result: VA-GPT在多个基准测试中优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: VA-GPT通过有效令牌对齐和跨域评估，显著提升了视频异常事件分析的准确性。

Abstract: Understanding abnormal events in videos is a vital and challenging task that
has garnered significant attention in a wide range of applications. Although
current video understanding Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are
capable of analyzing general videos, they often struggle to handle anomalies
due to the spatial and temporal sparsity of abnormal events, where the
redundant information always leads to suboptimal outcomes. To address these
challenges, exploiting the representation and generalization capabilities of
Vison Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose
VA-GPT, a novel MLLM designed for summarizing and localizing abnormal events in
various videos. Our approach efficiently aligns effective tokens between visual
encoders and LLMs through two key proposed modules: Spatial Effective Token
Selection (SETS) and Temporal Effective Token Generation (TETG). These modules
enable our model to effectively capture and analyze both spatial and temporal
information associated with abnormal events, resulting in more accurate
responses and interactions. Furthermore, we construct an instruction-following
dataset specifically for fine-tuning video-anomaly-aware MLLMs, and introduce a
cross-domain evaluation benchmark based on XD-Violence dataset. Our proposed
method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文实现了一种基于Goldstein、Bresson和Osher提出的两阶段图像分割算法，改进了Chan-Vese能量模型，并详细记录了其性能表现。

Result: 通过多组图像和参数测试，验证了算法的有效性和性能。

Conclusion: 该实现成功改进了Chan-Vese模型，为两阶段图像分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we describe an implementation of the two-phase image
segmentation algorithm proposed by Goldstein, Bresson, Osher in
\cite{gold:bre}. This algorithm partitions the domain of a given 2d image into
foreground and background regions, and each pixel of the image is assigned
membership to one of these two regions. The underlying assumption for the
segmentation model is that the pixel values of the input image can be
summarized by two distinct average values, and that the region boundaries are
smooth. Accordingly, the model is defined as an energy in which the variable is
a region membership function to assign pixels to either region, originally
proposed by Chan and Vese in \cite{chan:vese}. This energy is the sum of image
data terms in the regions and a length penalty for region boundaries.
Goldstein, Bresson, Osher modify the energy of Chan-Vese in \cite{gold:bre} so
that their new energy can be minimized efficiently using the split Bregman
method to produce an equivalent two-phase segmentation. We provide a detailed
implementation of this method \cite{gold:bre}, and document its performance
with several images over a range of algorithm parameters.

TL;DR: CLIPin是一种非对比性插件，可无缝集成到CLIP架构中，提升多模态语义对齐能力，增强模型的鲁棒性和泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模自然图像-文本数据集语义对齐松散和医学数据集内容多样性低的问题，提升对比性语言-图像预训练（CLIP）的效果。

Method: 提出CLIPin插件，设计两个共享预投影器，分别用于图像和文本模态，结合对比性和非对比性学习。

Result: 在多样下游任务中验证了CLIPin的有效性和通用性，证明其可作为即插即用组件。

Conclusion: CLIPin能显著提升CLIP架构的多模态对齐能力，适用于多种对比性框架。

Abstract: Large-scale natural image-text datasets, especially those automatically
collected from the web, often suffer from loose semantic alignment due to weak
supervision, while medical datasets tend to have high cross-modal correlation
but low content diversity. These properties pose a common challenge for
contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP): they hinder the model's ability
to learn robust and generalizable representations. In this work, we propose
CLIPin, a unified non-contrastive plug-in that can be seamlessly integrated
into CLIP-style architectures to improve multimodal semantic alignment,
providing stronger supervision and enhancing alignment robustness. Furthermore,
two shared pre-projectors are designed for image and text modalities
respectively to facilitate the integration of contrastive and non-contrastive
learning in a parameter-compromise manner. Extensive experiments on diverse
downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of CLIPin as a
plug-and-play component compatible with various contrastive frameworks. Code is
available at https://github.com/T6Yang/CLIPin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大量模态特定标注数据或仅适用于单一模态，限制了通用性和扩展性。

Method: TaAM-CPT结合模态提示池、文本构建和模态对齐文本编码器，设计跨模态学习目标以实现语义一致性。

Result: TaAM-CPT在视频、图像和音频分类任务中表现领先，无需模态特定标注数据。

Conclusion: TaAM-CPT展示了基于文本数据的通用多模态表示模型的潜力，具有高度扩展性和性能优势。

Abstract: The integration of prompt tuning with multimodal learning has shown
significant generalization abilities for various downstream tasks. Despite
advancements, existing methods heavily depend on massive modality-specific
labeled data (e.g., video, audio, and image), or are customized for a single
modality. In this study, we present Text as Any-Modality by Consistent Prompt
Tuning (TaAM-CPT), a scalable approach for constructing a general
representation model toward unlimited modalities using solely text data.
TaAM-CPT comprises modality prompt pools, text construction, and
modality-aligned text encoders from pre-trained models, which allows for
extending new modalities by simply adding prompt pools and modality-aligned
text encoders. To harmonize the learning across different modalities, TaAM-CPT
designs intra- and inter-modal learning objectives, which can capture category
details within modalities while maintaining semantic consistency across
different modalities. Benefiting from its scalable architecture and pre-trained
models, TaAM-CPT can be seamlessly extended to accommodate unlimited
modalities. Remarkably, without any modality-specific labeled data, TaAM-CPT
achieves leading results on diverse datasets spanning various modalities,
including video classification, image classification, and audio classification.

Motivation: 稀疏视图在3D重建中常导致未观测区域的伪影，现有方法因VDMs采样速度慢而受限。

Method: 提出基于GAN和软化反向KL散度最小化的视频扩散模型蒸馏方法，将多步去噪教师模型转化为少步去噪学生模型。

Result: 实验表明，FVGen在保持（或提升）视觉质量的同时，采样时间减少90%以上。

Conclusion: FVGen显著提升稀疏视图3D重建的时间效率，适用于需要多次运行VDMs的场景。

Abstract: Recent progress in 3D reconstruction has enabled realistic 3D models from
dense image captures, yet challenges persist with sparse views, often leading
to artifacts in unseen areas. Recent works leverage Video Diffusion Models
(VDMs) to generate dense observations, filling the gaps when only sparse views
are available for 3D reconstruction tasks. A significant limitation of these
methods is their slow sampling speed when using VDMs. In this paper, we present
FVGen, a novel framework that addresses this challenge by enabling fast novel
view synthesis using VDMs in as few as four sampling steps. We propose a novel
video diffusion model distillation method that distills a multi-step denoising
teacher model into a few-step denoising student model using Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) and softened reverse KL-divergence minimization.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that, compared to previous
works, our framework generates the same number of novel views with similar (or
even better) visual quality while reducing sampling time by more than 90%.
FVGen significantly improves time efficiency for downstream reconstruction
tasks, particularly when working with sparse input views (more than 2) where
pre-trained VDMs need to be run multiple times to achieve better spatial
coverage.

Abstract: Recent approaches for 3D relighting have shown promise in integrating 2D
image relighting generative priors to alter the appearance of a 3D
representation while preserving the underlying structure. Nevertheless,
generative priors used for 2D relighting that directly relight from an input
image do not take advantage of intrinsic properties of the subject that can be
inferred or cannot consider multi-view data at scale, leading to subpar
relighting. In this paper, we propose Lightswitch, a novel finetuned
material-relighting diffusion framework that efficiently relights an arbitrary
number of input images to a target lighting condition while incorporating cues
from inferred intrinsic properties. By using multi-view and material
information cues together with a scalable denoising scheme, our method
consistently and efficiently relights dense multi-view data of objects with
diverse material compositions. We show that our 2D relighting prediction
quality exceeds previous state-of-the-art relighting priors that directly
relight from images. We further demonstrate that LightSwitch matches or
outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion inverse rendering methods in relighting
synthetic and real objects in as little as 2 minutes.

Conclusion: 未来需开发更稳健且符合伦理的语言技术，以平衡LLMs的潜力与风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized content creation across
digital platforms, offering unprecedented capabilities in natural language
generation and understanding. These models enable beneficial applications such
as content generation, question and answering (Q&A), programming, and code
reasoning. Meanwhile, they also pose serious risks by inadvertently or
intentionally producing toxic, offensive, or biased content. This dual role of
LLMs, both as powerful tools for solving real-world problems and as potential
sources of harmful language, presents a pressing sociotechnical challenge. In
this survey, we systematically review recent studies spanning unintentional
toxicity, adversarial jailbreaking attacks, and content moderation techniques.
We propose a unified taxonomy of LLM-related harms and defenses, analyze
emerging multimodal and LLM-assisted jailbreak strategies, and assess
mitigation efforts, including reinforcement learning with human feedback
(RLHF), prompt engineering, and safety alignment. Our synthesis highlights the
evolving landscape of LLM safety, identifies limitations in current evaluation
methodologies, and outlines future research directions to guide the development
of robust and ethically aligned language technologies.

Conclusion: FineDialFact为细粒度对话事实验证提供了基准，任务仍具挑战性，未来需进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to produce hallucinations - factually
incorrect or fabricated information - which poses significant challenges for
many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, such as dialogue systems.
As a result, detecting hallucinations has become a critical area of research.
Current approaches to hallucination detection in dialogue systems primarily
focus on verifying the factual consistency of generated responses. However,
these responses often contain a mix of accurate, inaccurate or unverifiable
facts, making one factual label overly simplistic and coarse-grained. In this
paper, we introduce a benchmark, FineDialFact, for fine-grained dialogue fact
verification, which involves verifying atomic facts extracted from dialogue
responses. To support this, we construct a dataset based on publicly available
dialogue datasets and evaluate it using various baseline methods. Experimental
results demonstrate that methods incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
can enhance performance in dialogue fact verification. Despite this, the best
F1-score achieved on the HybriDialogue, an open-domain dialogue dataset, is
only 0.75, indicating that the benchmark remains a challenging task for future
research. Our dataset and code will be public on GitHub.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了短暂记忆对语言学习的益处，发现其能提升语言模型性能，但意外地降低了人类阅读时间的预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证短暂记忆是否有助于语言学习，尤其是在Transformer模型中。

Method: 在Transformer模型中对比训练有短暂记忆和无短暂记忆的版本，使用发展现实的训练集。

Result: 短暂记忆提升了语言学习性能（语言建模和句法评估），但降低了人类阅读时间的预测准确性。

Conclusion: 短暂记忆对神经网络语言学习有益，但对行为预测无益。

Abstract: Human memory is fleeting. As words are processed, the exact wordforms that
make up incoming sentences are rapidly lost. Cognitive scientists have long
believed that this limitation of memory may, paradoxically, help in learning
language - an idea supported by classic connectionist modelling work. The rise
of Transformers appears to challenge this idea, as these models can learn
language effectively, despite lacking memory limitations or other architectural
recency biases. Here, we investigate the hypothesized benefit of fleeting
memory for language learning in tightly controlled experiments on transformer
language models. Training transformers with and without fleeting memory on a
developmentally realistic training set, we find that fleeting memory
consistently improves language learning (as quantified by both overall language
modelling performance and targeted syntactic evaluation) but, unexpectedly,
impairs surprisal-based prediction of human reading times. Interestingly,
follow up analyses revealed that this discrepancy - better language modeling,
yet worse reading time prediction - could not be accounted for by prior
explanations of why better language models sometimes fit human reading time
worse. Together, these results support a benefit of memory limitations on
neural network language learning - but not on predicting behavior.

### [103] ["Mirror" Language AI Models of Depression are Criterion-Contaminated](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05830)
*Tong Li,Rasiq Hussain,Mehak Gupta,Joshua R. Oltmanns*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，基于语言的大模型（LLM）在预测抑郁评分时存在“镜像模型”效应，导致效果被高估，而“非镜像模型”更具泛化性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言AI模型在抑郁评估中的表现差异，特别是“镜像模型”因标准污染导致的效果膨胀问题。

Method: 使用GPT-4、GPT-4o和LLaMA3-70B模型，分别基于结构化诊断访谈和生活史访谈数据预测抑郁评分，对比镜像与非镜像模型的表现。

Result: 镜像模型效果显著（R²=0.80），但泛化性差；非镜像模型效果较小（R²=0.27），但更具实用性。两者与自报抑郁症状的相关性相同（r≈0.54）。

Conclusion: 镜像模型因标准污染导致效果膨胀，非镜像模型更具泛化性和实际应用价值，未来研究应关注后者。

Abstract: A growing number of studies show near-perfect LLM language-based prediction
of depression assessment scores (up to R2 of .70). However, many develop these
models directly from language responses to depression assessments. These
"Mirror models" suffer from "criterion contamination", which arises when a
predicted score depends in part on the predictors themselves. This causes
artificial effect size inflation which reduces model generalizability. The
present study compares the performance of Mirror models versus "Non-Mirror
models", which are developed from language that does not mirror the assessment
they are developed to predict. N = 110 research participants completed two
different interviews: structured diagnostic and life history interviews. GPT-4,
GPT-4o and LLaMA3-70B were then prompted to predict structured diagnostic
interview depression scores from the two transcripts separately. Mirror models
(using structured diagnostic data) showed very large effect sizes (e.g., R2 =
.80). As expected, NonMirror models (using life history data) demonstrated
smaller effect sizes, but were relatively large (e.g., R2 = .27). When Mirror
and Non-Mirror model-predicted structured interview depression scores were
correlated with self-reported depression symptoms, Mirror and NonMirror
performed the same (e.g., r = ~.54), indicating that Mirror models contain bias
perhaps due to criterion contamination. Topic modeling identified clusters
across Mirror and Non-Mirror models, as well as between true-positive and
false-positive predictions. In this head-to-head comparison study, Mirror
language AI models of depression showed artificially inflated effect sizes and
less generalizability. As language AI models for depression continue to evolve,
incorporating Non-Mirror models may identify interpretable, and generalizable
semantic features that have unique utility in real-world psychological
assessment.

Motivation: 研究旨在探索深度神经网络代理的新兴通信如何更接近自然语言特性，特别是屈折形态的拼接性和融合性。

Method: 通过小词汇量约束模拟双重分节，设计新指标并探索拼接性和融合性在游戏中的表现。

Result: 实验发现模拟音位约束促进了拼接性形态，而新兴语言复制了自然语言融合语法属性的趋势。

Conclusion: 研究为新兴通信提供了更接近自然语言的框架，揭示了其与自然语言形态的相似性。

Abstract: Emergent communication (EmCom) with deep neural network-based agents promises
to yield insights into the nature of human language, but remains focused
primarily on a few subfield-specific goals and metrics that prioritize
communication schemes which represent attributes with unique characters
one-to-one and compose them syntactically. We thus reinterpret a common EmCom
setting, the attribute-value reconstruction game, by imposing a
small-vocabulary constraint to simulate double articulation, and formulating a
novel setting analogous to naturalistic inflectional morphology (enabling
meaningful comparison to natural language communication schemes). We develop
new metrics and explore variations of this game motivated by real properties of
inflectional morphology: concatenativity and fusionality. Through our
experiments, we discover that simulated phonological constraints encourage
concatenative morphology, and emergent languages replicate the tendency of
natural languages to fuse grammatical attributes.

Result: 研究发现不同LLMs在情感推理中存在多样化的认知模式，并揭示了特定认知维度对不同情感的重要性。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种新的评估方法，揭示了LLMs在情感认知推理中的潜力，为未来研究提供了基准和工具。

Abstract: Affective Computing has been established as a crucial field of inquiry to
advance the holistic development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems.
Foundation models -- especially Large Language Models (LLMs) -- have been
evaluated, trained, or instruction-tuned in several past works, to become
better predictors or generators of emotion. Most of these studies, however,
approach emotion-related tasks in a supervised manner, assessing or training
the capabilities of LLMs using discrete emotion labels associated with stimuli
(e.g., text, images, video, audio). Evaluation studies, in particular, have
often been limited to standard and superficial emotion-related tasks, such as
the recognition of evoked or expressed emotions. In this paper, we move beyond
surface-level emotion tasks to investigate how LLMs reason about emotions
through cognitive dimensions. Drawing from cognitive appraisal theory, we
examine whether LLMs produce coherent and plausible cognitive reasoning when
reasoning about emotionally charged stimuli. We introduce a large-scale
benchmark on Cognitive Reasoning for Emotions - CoRE - to evaluate internal
cognitive structures implicitly used by LLMs for emotional reasoning. Through a
plethora of evaluation experiments and analysis, we seek to answer: (a) Are
models more likely to implicitly rely on specific cognitive appraisal
dimensions?, (b) What cognitive dimensions are important for characterizing
specific emotions?, and, (c) Can the internal representations of different
emotion categories in LLMs be interpreted through cognitive appraisal
dimensions? Our results and analyses reveal diverse reasoning patterns across
different LLMs. Our benchmark and code will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 现有检索增强生成（RAG）方法难以单独评估检索的贡献，尤其是LLM作为阅读器时对提示的敏感性。

Method: 引入Spectrum Projection Score（SPS），通过比较生成标记与子空间主方向形成的面积来度量语义对齐；基于SPS开发了动态压缩框架xCompress。

Result: 在五个QA基准测试和四个开源LLM上的实验表明，SPS能提升任务性能并提供检索与生成交互的理论视角。

Conclusion: SPS为检索增强生成提供了一种轻量级评估方法，xCompress框架进一步优化了检索摘要的动态压缩。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown improved generation performance
through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) following the retriever-reader
paradigm, which supplements model inputs with externally retrieved knowledge.
However, prior work often evaluates RAG holistically, assessing the retriever
and reader jointly, making it difficult to isolate the true contribution of
retrieval, particularly given the prompt sensitivity of LLMs used as readers.
We introduce Spectrum Projection Score (SPS), a lightweight, supervision-free
metric that allows the reader to gauge the semantic alignment of a retrieved
summary with its hidden representation by comparing the area formed by
generated tokens from the summary, and the principal directions of subspace in
the reader and to measure the relevance. Building on SPS we present xCompress,
an inference time controller framework that dynamically samples, ranks, and
compresses retrieval summary candidates. Extensive experiments on five QA
benchmarks with four open source LLMs show that SPS not only enhances
performance across a range of tasks but also provides a principled perspective
on the interaction between retrieval and generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 亲社会性检测在信任与安全系统中日益重要，但缺乏明确的定义和标注数据，需要新的方法。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：1) 基于小规模人类标注数据优化LLM标注策略；2) 人类-AI协作迭代优化任务定义；3) 训练两阶段推理系统，结合轻量级分类器和GPT-4o。

Result: 系统降低了70%的推理成本，同时保持高精度（约0.90）。

Conclusion: 通过人类-AI协作、任务定义优化和部署感知设计，可扩展解决新兴AI任务。

Abstract: Detecting prosociality in text--communication intended to affirm, support, or
improve others' behavior--is a novel and increasingly important challenge for
trust and safety systems. Unlike toxic content detection, prosociality lacks
well-established definitions and labeled data, requiring new approaches to both
annotation and deployment. We present a practical, three-stage pipeline that
enables scalable, high-precision prosocial content classification while
minimizing human labeling effort and inference costs. First, we identify the
best LLM-based labeling strategy using a small seed set of human-labeled
examples. We then introduce a human-AI refinement loop, where annotators review
high-disagreement cases between GPT-4 and humans to iteratively clarify and
expand the task definition-a critical step for emerging annotation tasks like
prosociality. This process results in improved label quality and definition
alignment. Finally, we synthesize 10k high-quality labels using GPT-4 and train
a two-stage inference system: a lightweight classifier handles high-confidence
predictions, while only $\sim$35\% of ambiguous instances are escalated to
GPT-4o. This architecture reduces inference costs by $\sim$70% while achieving
high precision ($\sim$0.90). Our pipeline demonstrates how targeted human-AI
interaction, careful task formulation, and deployment-aware architecture design
can unlock scalable solutions for novel responsible AI tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注主题共享特征，忽略了主题特定特征，导致评估关键特质（如主题一致性）的能力受限。

Method: ATOP通过优化可学习的主题感知提示（包含共享和特定组件）从预训练语言模型中提取相关知识，并结合对抗训练和邻居分类器增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在ASAP++数据集上的实验表明，ATOP在整体和多特质作文评分上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ATOP通过联合学习主题共享和特定特征，有效提升了跨主题AES的性能，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Cross-topic automated essay scoring (AES) aims to develop a transferable
model capable of effectively evaluating essays on a target topic. A significant
challenge in this domain arises from the inherent discrepancies between topics.
While existing methods predominantly focus on extracting topic-shared features
through distribution alignment of source and target topics, they often neglect
topic-specific features, limiting their ability to assess critical traits such
as topic adherence. To address this limitation, we propose an Adversarial
TOpic-aware Prompt-tuning (ATOP), a novel method that jointly learns
topic-shared and topic-specific features to improve cross-topic AES. ATOP
achieves this by optimizing a learnable topic-aware prompt--comprising both
shared and specific components--to elicit relevant knowledge from pre-trained
language models (PLMs). To enhance the robustness of topic-shared prompt
learning and mitigate feature scale sensitivity introduced by topic alignment,
we incorporate adversarial training within a unified regression and
classification framework. In addition, we employ a neighbor-based classifier to
model the local structure of essay representations and generate pseudo-labels
for target-topic essays. These pseudo-labels are then used to guide the
supervised learning of topic-specific prompts tailored to the target topic.
Extensive experiments on the publicly available ASAP++ dataset demonstrate that
ATOP significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both
holistic and multi-trait essay scoring. The implementation of our method is
publicly available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ATOP-A271.

Motivation: 解决Transformer模型中自注意力机制二次计算成本高的问题，并探索稀疏性是否可以作为提高模型性能的工具。

Method: 在DistilBERT模型的注意力机制中引入结构化、后验稀疏性，并在SST-2情感分析任务上进行微调。

Result: 80%稀疏性的模型验证准确率达到91.59%，比密集基线提高了0.97%。

Conclusion: 稀疏性可以作为隐式正则化器，提高Transformer模型的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: The quadratic computational cost of the self-attention mechanism is a primary
challenge in scaling Transformer models. While attention sparsity is widely
studied as a technique to improve computational efficiency, it is almost
universally assumed to come at the cost of model accuracy. In this paper, we
report a surprising counter-example to this common wisdom. By introducing
structured, post-hoc sparsity to the attention mechanism of a DistilBERT model
during fine-tuning on the SST-2 sentiment analysis task, we find that model
accuracy improves significantly. Our model with 80\% attention sparsity
achieves a validation accuracy of 91.59\%, a 0.97\% absolute improvement over
the dense baseline. We hypothesize that this phenomenon is due to sparsity
acting as a powerful implicit regularizer, preventing the model from
overfitting by forcing it to make predictions with a more constrained and
robust set of features. Our work recasts attention sparsity not just as a tool
for computational efficiency, but as a potential method for improving the
generalization and performance of Transformer models.

Motivation: 现有自奖励语言模型在同步改进选择和拒绝样本时，逐渐缩小了对比样本的表示差异，削弱了偏好学习效果。

Method: 提出双阶段框架：(1)锚定拒绝样本（固定初始模型的拒绝输出）；(2)未来引导选择样本（动态筛选未来模型预测的选择样本）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个模型家族和任务中显著优于基线，例如Llama3.1-8B在AlpacaEval 2.0上的胜率提升9.75。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了性能，还展现出更强的泛化能力，适用于数学推理、知识问答和代码生成等任务。

Abstract: Self-Rewarding Language Models propose an architecture in which the Large
Language Models(LLMs) both generates responses and evaluates its own outputs
via LLM-as-a-Judge prompting, dynamically improving its generative capabilities
through iterative Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). However, our analysis
reveals a critical limitation in existing Self-Rewarding paradigms: the
synchronized improvement of chosen and rejected responses progressively narrows
the representational difference between contrasting samples, undermining
effective preference learning. We propose \textbf{Temporal Self-Rewarding
Language Models} that strategically coordinate past, present, and future model
generations to sustain learning signals. Our dual-phase framework introduces:
(1) \textit{Anchored Rejection} - fixing rejected responses using the past
initial model's outputs and (2) \textit{Future-Guided Chosen} - dynamically
curating chosen samples using next-generation model predictions. Extensive
experiments across three model families (Llama, Qwen, Mistral) and different
model sizes (Llama3B/8B/70B) demonstrate significant improvements when trained
with our method compared to Self-Rewarding using same computation resources.
For example, Llama3.1-8B reaches a 29.44 win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0 with our
method, outperforming the Self-Rewarding baseline (19.69) by 9.75. Notably, our
method also demonstrates superior out-of-distribution generalization across
mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), knowledge-based QA (ARC, TruthfulQA), and code
generation (HumanEval) tasks, even though we do not specifically collect such
training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM的随机性，难以预测其掌握的知识，传统方法计算成本高且耗时。

Method: 利用预训练的嵌入模型（如文本或图嵌入）作为代理，通过线性解码层预测LLM的输出。

Result: 在3个维基百科数据集、4种LLM和7种嵌入模型上，嵌入模型预测LLM知识的准确率高达90%。

Conclusion: 知识适配的嵌入模型可大规模识别LLM的知识缺口，并揭示其内部归纳偏差。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire knowledge across diverse domains such as
science, history, and geography encountered during generative pre-training.
However, due to their stochasticity, it is difficult to predict what LLMs have
acquired. Prior work has developed different ways to probe this knowledge by
investigating the hidden representations, crafting specific task prompts,
curating representative samples, and estimating their uncertainty. However,
these methods require making forward passes through the underlying model to
probe the LLM's knowledge about a specific fact, making them computationally
expensive and time-consuming. To bridge this gap, we propose $\textbf{PEEK}$ or
$\textbf{P}$roxy $\textbf{E}$mbeddings to $\textbf{E}$stimate
$\textbf{K}$nowledge of LLMs, by leveraging the pre-trained embedding models
that effectively encode factual knowledge as text or graphs as proxies for
LLMs. First, we identify a training set of facts known by LLMs through various
probing strategies and then adapt embedding models to predict the LLM outputs
with a linear decoder layer. Comprehensive evaluation on $3$ Wikipedia-derived
datasets, $4$ LLMs, and $7$ embedding models shows that embeddings can predict
LLM knowledge on a held-out set with up to 90 % accuracy. Furthermore, we find
that sentence embedding models are more suitable than graph embeddings to
predict LLM knowledge, shedding light on the underlying representation of the
factual landscape. Thus, we believe that knowledge-adapted embeddings can be
used to identify knowledge gaps in LLMs at scale and can provide deeper
insights into LLMs' internal inductive bias. The code and data are made
available at https://github.com/claws-lab/peek.

Result: 在StoryER、HANNA和OpenMEVA三个基准测试中达到SOTA性能，并显著提升生成故事的质量。

Conclusion: EvolvR框架通过自进化方法有效解决了故事评估中的推理问题，验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Although the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges
(LLM-as-a-judge) has been validated, their performance remains limited in
open-ended tasks, particularly in story evaluation. Accurate story evaluation
is crucial not only for assisting human quality judgment but also for providing
key signals to guide story generation. However, existing methods face a
dilemma: prompt engineering for closed-source models suffers from poor
adaptability, while fine-tuning approaches for open-source models lack the
rigorous reasoning capabilities essential for story evaluation. To address
this, we propose the Self-Evolving Pairwise Reasoning (EvolvR) framework.
Grounded in pairwise comparison, the framework first self-synthesizes
score-aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data via a multi-persona strategy. To
ensure data quality, these raw CoTs undergo a self-filtering process, utilizing
multi-agents to guarantee their logical rigor and robustness. Finally, the
evaluator trained on the refined data is deployed as a reward model to guide
the story generation task. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on three evaluation benchmarks
including StoryER, HANNA and OpenMEVA. Furthermore, when served as a reward
model, it significantly enhances the quality of generated stories, thereby
fully validating the superiority of our self-evolving approach.

Conclusion: ConlangCrafter展示了LLM在辅助人工语言创造中的潜力，为未来语言设计和计算创造力研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Constructed languages (conlangs) such as Esperanto and Quenya have played
diverse roles in art, philosophy, and international communication. Meanwhile,
large-scale foundation models have revolutionized creative generation in text,
images, and beyond. In this work, we leverage modern LLMs as computational
creativity aids for end-to-end conlang creation. We introduce ConlangCrafter, a
multi-hop pipeline that decomposes language design into modular stages --
phonology, morphology, syntax, lexicon generation, and translation. At each
stage, our method leverages LLMs' meta-linguistic reasoning capabilities,
injecting randomness to encourage diversity and leveraging self-refinement
feedback to encourage consistency in the emerging language description. We
evaluate ConlangCrafter on metrics measuring coherence and typological
diversity, demonstrating its ability to produce coherent and varied conlangs
without human linguistic expertise.

and perception. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this by
retrieving query-relevant contexts from knowledge bases to support LLM
reasoning. Recent advances leverage pre-constructed graphs to capture the
relational connections among distributed documents, showing remarkable
performance in complex tasks. However, existing Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG)
methods rely on a costly process to transform the corpus into a graph,
introducing overwhelming token cost and update latency. Moreover, real-world
queries vary in type and complexity, requiring different logic structures for
accurate reasoning. The pre-built graph may not align with these required
structures, resulting in ineffective knowledge retrieval. To this end, we
propose a \textbf{\underline{Logic}}-aware
\textbf{\underline{R}}etrieval-\textbf{\underline{A}}ugmented
\textbf{\underline{G}}eneration framework (\textbf{LogicRAG}) that dynamically
extracts reasoning structures at inference time to guide adaptive retrieval
without any pre-built graph. LogicRAG begins by decomposing the input query
into a set of subproblems and constructing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to
model the logical dependencies among them. To support coherent multi-step
reasoning, LogicRAG then linearizes the graph using topological sort, so that
subproblems can be addressed in a logically consistent order. Besides, LogicRAG
applies graph pruning to reduce redundant retrieval and uses context pruning to
filter irrelevant context, significantly reducing the overall token cost.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LogicRAG achieves both superior
performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

*Sayantan Adak,Pratyush Chatterjee,Somnath Banerjee,Rima Hazra,Somak Aditya,Animesh Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出AURA框架，通过多层次的Process Reward Models（PRMs）解决LLMs在逻辑推理和安全性上的不足，显著提升模型输出的安全性和逻辑完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在逻辑推理中可能因忽视隐含逻辑而引发安全风险，传统方法缺乏细粒度和主动性，无法可靠检测和干预。

Method: 引入AURA框架，结合自省式自我批判、细粒度PRM评估和自适应安全解码，动态引导模型推理。

Result: 实验证明AURA显著优于现有方法，提升了模型输出的逻辑完整性和安全性。

Conclusion: AURA为AI的安全性和上下文感知设定了新标准，推动了更负责任的人工智能发展。

Abstract: Present day LLMs face the challenge of managing affordance-based safety
risks-situations where outputs inadvertently facilitate harmful actions due to
overlooked logical implications. Traditional safety solutions, such as scalar
outcome-based reward models, parameter tuning, or heuristic decoding
strategies, lack the granularity and proactive nature needed to reliably detect
and intervene during subtle yet crucial reasoning steps. Addressing this
fundamental gap, we introduce AURA, an innovative, multi-layered framework
centered around Process Reward Models (PRMs), providing comprehensive, step
level evaluations across logical coherence and safety-awareness. Our framework
seamlessly combines introspective self-critique, fine-grained PRM assessments,
and adaptive safety-aware decoding to dynamically and proactively guide models
toward safer reasoning trajectories. Empirical evidence clearly demonstrates
that this approach significantly surpasses existing methods, significantly
improving the logical integrity and affordance-sensitive safety of model
outputs. This research represents a pivotal step toward safer, more
responsible, and contextually aware AI, setting a new benchmark for
alignment-sensitive applications.

*Lingyuan Liu,Mengxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为选择性反射蒸馏（SRD）的新框架，通过动态评估和选择高质量、学生兼容的训练数据，提升知识蒸馏（KD）的效果和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有白盒KD方法忽视训练数据质量和学生模型兼容性，限制了蒸馏效果。

Method: SRD利用学生模型反馈动态筛选数据，并通过课程调度策略逐步引入数据。

Result: 实验表明SRD显著提升蒸馏模型性能，并减少训练时间达39%。

Conclusion: 数据质量和兼容性是KD的关键，SRD为高效压缩大语言模型提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a fundamental technique for compressing large
language models (LLMs) into compact, efficient student models. However,
existing white-box KD methods mainly focus on balancing ground truth and
student-generated responses while overlooking two critical factors: training
data quality and student-model compatibility. To address these limitations, we
propose Selective Reflection Distillation (SRD), a novel data curation
framework that leverages reflections from student models to systematically
refine training data. SRD dynamically evaluates and selects prompt-response
pairs by comparing ground truth data with student model outputs, selectively
curating high-quality, student-compatible training instances through automated
ranking based on difficulty. Furthermore, after selecting the training data, a
curriculum scheduling strategy is employed to incrementally introduce these
curated subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals. As a
plug-and-play enhancement, SRD consistently improves distillation outcomes
across diverse white-box KD approaches and model architectures, as well as
decreases computational cost significantly during KD training. Experiments on a
range of language model benchmarks demonstrate SRD's consistent improvements in
distilled model performance, as well as a reduction in training runtime by up
to 39%, under diverse KD methods and model families. Notably, SRD operates as a
plug-and-play module, enhancing sample efficiency without modifying underlying
KD algorithms. Our findings highlight that data quality and compatibility are
pivotal to effective and efficient distillation of LLMs, and SRD provides a
principled framework to achieve both. This work advances the understanding of
data-centric factors in KD and offers practical insights for enhancing the
capability and efficiency of compressed LLMs.

Abstract: This paper addresses the issue of implicit stereotypes that may arise during
the generation process of large language models. It proposes an interpretable
bias detection method aimed at identifying hidden social biases in model
outputs, especially those semantic tendencies that are not easily captured
through explicit linguistic features. The method combines nested semantic
representation with a contextual contrast mechanism. It extracts latent bias
features from the vector space structure of model outputs. Using attention
weight perturbation, it analyzes the model's sensitivity to specific social
attribute terms, thereby revealing the semantic pathways through which bias is
formed. To validate the effectiveness of the method, this study uses the
StereoSet dataset, which covers multiple stereotype dimensions including
gender, profession, religion, and race. The evaluation focuses on several key
metrics, such as bias detection accuracy, semantic consistency, and contextual
sensitivity. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves strong
detection performance across various dimensions. It can accurately identify
bias differences between semantically similar texts while maintaining high
semantic alignment and output stability. The method also demonstrates high
interpretability in its structural design. It helps uncover the internal bias
association mechanisms within language models. This provides a more transparent
and reliable technical foundation for bias detection. The approach is suitable
for real-world applications where high trustworthiness of generated content is
required.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型合并方法采用统一的稀疏率，忽略了参数的结构和统计异质性，导致关键参数被误删或冗余参数被保留。

Method: TADrop根据参数张量的分布特性分配稀疏率，密集冗余的张量被大幅修剪，稀疏关键的张量被保留。

Result: TADrop显著提升了多种任务和模型的性能，例如在ViT-B/32任务上平均提升2.0%。

Conclusion: TADrop通过自适应稀疏化有效减少参数干扰，为高性能模型合并提供了新基准。

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a compelling data-free paradigm for multi-task
learning, enabling the fusion of multiple fine-tuned models into a single,
powerful entity. A key technique in merging methods is sparsification, which
prunes redundant parameters from task vectors to mitigate interference.
However, prevailing approaches employ a ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy,
applying a uniform sparsity ratio that overlooks the inherent structural and
statistical heterogeneity of model parameters. This often leads to a suboptimal
trade-off, where critical parameters are inadvertently pruned while less useful
ones are retained. To address this limitation, we introduce \textbf{TADrop}
(\textbf{T}ensor-wise \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{Drop}), an adaptive
sparsification strategy that respects this heterogeneity. Instead of a global
ratio, TADrop assigns a tailored sparsity level to each parameter tensor based
on its distributional properties. The core intuition is that tensors with
denser, more redundant distributions can be pruned aggressively, while sparser,
more critical ones are preserved. As a simple and plug-and-play module, we
validate TADrop by integrating it with foundational, classic, and SOTA merging
methods. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks (vision, language, and
multimodal) and models (ViT, BEiT) demonstrate that TADrop consistently and
significantly boosts their performance. For instance, when enhancing a leading
merging method, it achieves an average performance gain of 2.0\% across 8
ViT-B/32 tasks. TADrop provides a more effective way to mitigate parameter
interference by tailoring sparsification to the model's structure, offering a
new baseline for high-performance model merging.

Motivation: 现有方法中检索增强生成（RAG）和基于奖励的强化学习（RLVR）能力孤立发展，限制了泛化性和应用范围。

Method: 提出UR2框架，包含难度感知课程训练和混合知识访问策略，动态协调检索与推理。

Result: 在多个任务上显著优于现有方法，性能接近GPT-4o-mini和GPT-4.1-mini。

Conclusion: UR2通过统一检索与推理，提升了模型的适应性和性能，适用于广泛领域。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities through two
complementary paradigms: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which enhances
knowledge grounding, and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR),
which optimizes complex reasoning abilities. However, these two capabilities
are often developed in isolation, and existing efforts to unify them remain
narrow in scope-typically limited to open-domain QA with fixed retrieval
settings and task-specific assumptions. This lack of integration constrains
generalization and limits the applicability of RAG-RL methods to broader
domains. To bridge this gap, we propose UR2 (Unified RAG and Reasoning), a
general framework that unifies retrieval and reasoning through reinforcement
learning. UR2 introduces two key contributions: a difficulty-aware curriculum
training that selectively invokes retrieval only for challenging problems, and
a hybrid knowledge access strategy combining domain-specific offline corpora
with LLM-generated summaries. These components are designed to enable dynamic
coordination between retrieval and reasoning, improving adaptability across a
diverse range of tasks. Experiments across open-domain QA, MMLU-Pro, medical,
and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that UR2 (built on Qwen2.5-3/7B
and LLaMA-3.1-8B) significantly outperforms existing RAG and RL methods,
achieving comparable performance to GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4.1-mini on several
benchmarks. We have released all code, models, and data at

Motivation: 传统语用学理论基于人类假设，不适用于LLM，需调整以适应生成式AI的通信需求。

Method: 挑战传统符号三分法，提出人机通信框架；分析概率语用学（如理性言语行为框架）的适用性；讨论替代主义问题及语境挫折现象。

Result: 传统语用学需扩展以涵盖LLM通信，概率语用学更适配；语境挫折现象揭示了用户与模型共同构建语用条件的必要性。

Conclusion: 语用学理论需调整以更好适应生成式AI的通信，强调人机协作的语用条件构建。

Abstract: The paper reconceptualizes pragmatics not as a subordinate, third dimension
of meaning, but as a dynamic interface through which language operates as a
socially embedded tool for action. With the emergence of large language models
(LLMs) in communicative contexts, this understanding needs to be further
refined and methodologically reconsidered. The first section challenges the
traditional semiotic trichotomy, arguing that connectionist LLM architectures
destabilize established hierarchies of meaning, and proposes the Human-Machine
Communication (HMC) framework as a more suitable alternative. The second
section examines the tension between human-centred pragmatic theories and the
machine-centred nature of LLMs. While traditional, Gricean-inspired pragmatics
continue to dominate, it relies on human-specific assumptions ill-suited to
predictive systems like LLMs. Probabilistic pragmatics, particularly the
Rational Speech Act framework, offers a more compatible teleology by focusing
on optimization rather than truth-evaluation. The third section addresses the
issue of substitutionalism in three forms - generalizing, linguistic, and
communicative - highlighting the anthropomorphic biases that distort LLM
evaluation and obscure the role of human communicative subjects. Finally, the
paper introduces the concept of context frustration to describe the paradox of
increased contextual input paired with a collapse in contextual understanding,
emphasizing how users are compelled to co-construct pragmatic conditions both
for the model and themselves. These arguments suggest that pragmatic theory may
need to be adjusted or expanded to better account for communication involving
generative AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM通常需要大量文本才能有效获取新知识，但在少量数据（几千或几百万标记）下更新模型仍具挑战性。本文旨在探索如何高效注入小规模信息，并分析其与遗忘现象的关联。

Method: 通过持续预训练基线，研究不同数据增强算法生成合成数据的效果，评估模型在新闻数据集上的知识获取能力。

Result: 实验表明，持续预训练效果有限，而多样化文本变体能显著提升新知识学习能力，尤其是通过多样化提示诱导更大变异性。RAG方法在知识注入时易导致性能下降。

Conclusion: 模型可生成有效的合成训练数据，为小数据下的高效知识注入提供了可能。代码和数据已公开，便于进一步研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often require vast amounts of text to
effectively acquire new knowledge. While continuing pre-training on large
corpora or employing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven
successful, updating an LLM with only a few thousand or million tokens remains
challenging. In this work, we investigate the task of injecting small,
unstructured information into LLMs and its relation to the catastrophic
forgetting phenomenon. We use a dataset of recent news -- ensuring no overlap
with the model's pre-training data -- to evaluate the knowledge acquisition by
probing the model with question-answer pairs related the learned information.
Starting from a continued pre-training baseline, we explored different
augmentation algorithms to generate synthetic data to improve the knowledge
acquisition capabilities. Our experiments show that simply continuing
pre-training on limited data yields modest improvements, whereas exposing the
model to diverse textual variations significantly improves the learning of new
facts -- particularly with methods that induce greater variability through
diverse prompting. Furthermore, we shed light on the forgetting phenomenon in
small-data regimes, illustrating the delicate balance between learning new
content and retaining existing capabilities. We also confirm the sensitivity of
RAG-based approaches for knowledge injection, which often lead to greater
degradation on control datasets compared to parametric methods. Finally, we
demonstrate that models can generate effective synthetic training data
themselves, suggesting a pathway toward self-improving model updates. All code
and generated data used in our experiments are publicly available, providing a

Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言理解方面表现优异，但医疗领域需要更精准的工具。DKG-LLM旨在整合动态知识图谱，解决复杂医疗数据的噪声和多症状疾病问题。

Method: 采用自适应语义融合算法（ASFA），结合贝叶斯推理和图优化，动态生成和更新知识图谱。使用MIMIC-III和PubMed数据集进行评估。

Result: DKG-LLM诊断准确率达84.19%，治疗推荐准确率89.63%，语义覆盖率达93.48%。

Conclusion: DKG-LLM是一个可靠且具有变革性的工具，能够处理噪声数据和复杂疾病，并通过医生反馈持续学习。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have grown exponentially since the release of
ChatGPT. These models have gained attention due to their robust performance on
various tasks, including language processing tasks. These models achieve
understanding and comprehension of tasks by training billions of parameters.
The development of these models is a transformative force in enhancing natural
language understanding and has taken a significant step towards artificial
general intelligence (AGI). In this study, we aim to present the DKG-LLM
framework. The DKG-LLM framework introduces a groundbreaking approach to
medical diagnosis and personalized treatment recommendations by integrating a
dynamic knowledge graph (DKG) with the Grok 3 large language model. Using the
Adaptive Semantic Fusion Algorithm (ASFA), heterogeneous medical data
(including clinical reports and PubMed articles) and patient records
dynamically generate a knowledge graph consisting of 15,964 nodes in 13
distinct types (e.g., diseases, symptoms, treatments, patient profiles) and
127,392 edges in 26 relationship types (e.g., causal, therapeutic,
association). ASFA utilizes advanced probabilistic models, Bayesian inference,
and graph optimization to extract semantic information, dynamically updating
the graph with approximately 150 new nodes and edges in each data category
while maintaining scalability with up to 987,654 edges. Real-world datasets,
including MIMIC-III and PubMed, were utilized to evaluate the proposed
architecture. The evaluation results show that DKG-LLM achieves a diagnostic
accuracy of 84.19%. The model also has a treatment recommendation accuracy of
89.63% and a semantic coverage of 93.48%. DKG-LLM is a reliable and
transformative tool that handles noisy data and complex multi-symptom diseases,
along with feedback-based learning from physician input.

Motivation: 现有越狱评估方法多为二元分类或多维度统一标准，无法量化危害强度且存在场景不匹配问题，导致评估精度不足。

Method: 提出SceneJailEval框架，包括场景自适应的多维度评估标准和14个场景的数据集，支持灵活扩展。

Result: 在全面场景数据集上F1得分为0.917（比之前最优高6%），在JBB上为0.995（高3%），验证了其优势。

Conclusion: SceneJailEval通过场景自适应框架和高性能表现，显著提升了越狱评估的精确性和适用性。

Abstract: Precise jailbreak evaluation is vital for LLM red teaming and jailbreak
research. Current approaches employ binary classification ( e.g., string
matching, toxic text classifiers, LLM-driven methods), yielding only "yes/no"
labels without quantifying harm intensity. Existing multi-dimensional
frameworks ( e.g., Security Violation, Relative Truthfulness, Informativeness)
apply uniform evaluation criteria across scenarios, resulting in
scenario-specific mismatches--for instance, "Relative Truthfulness" is
irrelevant to "hate speech"--which compromise evaluation precision. To tackle
these limitations, we introduce SceneJailEval, with key contributions: (1) A
groundbreaking scenario-adaptive multi-dimensional framework for jailbreak
evaluation, overcoming the critical "one-size-fits-all" constraint of existing
multi-dimensional methods, and featuring strong extensibility to flexibly adapt
to customized or emerging scenarios. (2) A comprehensive 14-scenario dataset
with diverse jailbreak variants and regional cases, filling the long-standing
gap in high-quality, holistic benchmarks for scenario-adaptive evaluation. (3)
SceneJailEval achieves state-of-the-art results, with an F1 score of 0.917 on
our full-scenario dataset (+6% over prior SOTA) and 0.995 on JBB (+3% over
prior SOTA), surpassing accuracy limits of existing evaluation methods in
heterogeneous scenarios and confirming its advantage.

Conclusion: 现有预训练和指令微调方法在提升LLMs情感推理能力方面存在局限，需针对性数据和建模策略。

Abstract: Emotional Intelligence (EI) is a critical yet underexplored dimension in the
development of human-aligned LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce a unified,
psychologically grounded four-layer taxonomy of EI tailored for large language
models (LLMs), encompassing emotional tracking, cause inference, appraisal, and
emotionally appropriate response generation. Building on this framework, we
present EICAP-Bench, a novel MCQ style multi-turn benchmark designed to
evaluate EI capabilities in open-source LLMs across diverse linguistic and
cultural contexts. We evaluate six LLMs: LLaMA3 (8B), LLaMA3-Instruct, Gemma
(9B), Gemma-Instruct, Qwen2.5 (7B), and Qwen2.5-Instruct on EmoCap-Bench,
identifying Qwen2.5-Instruct as the strongest baseline. To assess the potential
for enhancing EI capabilities, we fine-tune both Qwen2.5-Base and
Qwen2.5-Instruct using LoRA adapters on UltraChat (UC), a large-scale,
instruction-tuned dialogue dataset, in both English and Arabic. Our statistical
analysis reveals that among the five EI layers, only the Appraisal layer shows
significant improvement through UC-based fine-tuning. These findings highlight
the limitations of existing pretraining and instruction-tuning paradigms in
equipping LLMs with deeper emotional reasoning and underscore the need for
targeted data and modeling strategies for comprehensive EI alignment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分类系统难以快速适应政策变化，需要重新训练模型，成本高昂。

Method: 采用检索增强生成（RAG）方法，将分类任务转化为基于检索到的政策知识进行内容评估。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在仇恨言论检测中表现优异，支持动态政策更新和细粒度控制。

Conclusion: RAG方法使分类更灵活、透明和适应性强，适用于内容审核及其他分类问题。

Abstract: Robust content moderation requires classification systems that can quickly
adapt to evolving policies without costly retraining. We present classification
using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shifts traditional
classification tasks from determining the correct category in accordance with
pre-trained parameters to evaluating content in relation to contextual
knowledge retrieved at inference. In hate speech detection, this transforms the
task from "is this hate speech?" to "does this violate the hate speech policy?"
  Our Contextual Policy Engine (CPE) - an agentic RAG system - demonstrates
this approach and offers three key advantages: (1) robust classification
accuracy comparable to leading commercial systems, (2) inherent explainability
via retrieved policy segments, and (3) dynamic policy updates without model
retraining. Through three experiments, we demonstrate strong baseline
performance and show that the system can apply fine-grained policy control by
correctly adjusting protection for specific identity groups without requiring
retraining or compromising overall performance. These findings establish that
RAG can transform classification into a more flexible, transparent, and
adaptable process for content moderation and wider classification problems.

Result: 当前VLMs在计算和语义因果推理上表现较差，与人类相比存在显著差距。

Conclusion: InfoCausalQA揭示了提升多模态AI系统因果推理能力的必要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in perception and reasoning. However, the ability to perform
causal inference -- a core aspect of human cognition -- remains underexplored,
particularly in multimodal settings. In this study, we introduce InfoCausalQA,
a novel benchmark designed to evaluate causal reasoning grounded in
infographics that combine structured visual data with textual context. The
benchmark comprises two tasks: Task 1 focuses on quantitative causal reasoning
based on inferred numerical trends, while Task 2 targets semantic causal
reasoning involving five types of causal relations: cause, effect,
intervention, counterfactual, and temporal. We manually collected 494
infographic-text pairs from four public sources and used GPT-4o to generate
1,482 high-quality multiple-choice QA pairs. These questions were then
carefully revised by humans to ensure they cannot be answered based on
surface-level cues alone but instead require genuine visual grounding. Our
experimental results reveal that current VLMs exhibit limited capability in
computational reasoning and even more pronounced limitations in semantic causal
reasoning. Their significantly lower performance compared to humans indicates a
substantial gap in leveraging infographic-based information for causal
inference. Through InfoCausalQA, we highlight the need for advancing the causal
reasoning abilities of multimodal AI systems.

*Theresa Pekarek Rosin,Burak Can Kaplan,Stefan Wermter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合Whisper ASR模型和Transformer语言模型的新方法，用于识别德语老年用户的语音意图，并通过合成数据提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有意图识别方法多针对英语短命令，本文旨在解决德语老年用户语音意图识别的数据稀缺问题。

Method: 结合Whisper ASR模型和基于Transformer的语言模型，利用LLM（LeoLM、Llama3、ChatGPT）生成合成数据。

Result: 合成数据显著提升分类性能，LeoLM在德语意图识别中表现优于ChatGPT。

Conclusion: 生成式AI能有效填补低资源领域的数据缺口，方法透明且可复现。

Abstract: Intent recognition (IR) for speech commands is essential for artificial
intelligence (AI) assistant systems; however, most existing approaches are
limited to short commands and are predominantly developed for English. This
paper addresses these limitations by focusing on IR from speech by elderly
German speakers. We propose a novel approach that combines an adapted Whisper
ASR model, fine-tuned on elderly German speech (SVC-de), with Transformer-based
language models trained on synthetic text datasets generated by three
well-known large language models (LLMs): LeoLM, Llama3, and ChatGPT. To
evaluate the robustness of our approach, we generate synthetic speech with a
text-to-speech model and conduct extensive cross-dataset testing. Our results
show that synthetic LLM-generated data significantly boosts classification
performance and robustness to different speaking styles and unseen vocabulary.
Notably, we find that LeoLM, a smaller, domain-specific 13B LLM, surpasses the
much larger ChatGPT (175B) in dataset quality for German intent recognition.
Our approach demonstrates that generative AI can effectively bridge data gaps
in low-resource domains. We provide detailed documentation of our data
generation and training process to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

### [130] [Matrix-Driven Instant Review: Confident Detection and Reconstruction of LLM Plagiarism on PC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06309)
*Ruichong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法MDIR，用于检测大型语言模型（LLM）的抄袭行为，解决了现有方法在权重对应重建、统计显著性计算和误报方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，LLM的知识产权问题日益突出，现有抄袭检测方法存在局限性，亟需一种更准确、高效的方法。

Method: MDIR基于矩阵分析和大偏差理论，能够准确重建权重关系并提供严格的p值估计，无需完整模型推理。

Result: 实验表明，MDIR即使在模型经过随机置换或持续预训练等复杂变换后，仍能可靠检测抄袭，且计算高效。

Conclusion: MDIR是一种高效、准确的LLM抄袭检测方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: In recent years, concerns about intellectual property (IP) in large language
models (LLMs) have grown significantly. Plagiarizing other LLMs (through direct
weight copying, upcycling, pruning, or continual pretraining) and claiming
authorship without properly attributing to the original license, is a serious
misconduct that can lead to significant financial and reputational harm to the
original developers. However, existing methods for detecting LLM plagiarism
fall short in key areas. They fail to accurately reconstruct weight
correspondences, lack the ability to compute statistical significance measures
such as $p$-values, and may mistakenly flag models trained on similar data as
being related. To address these limitations, we propose Matrix-Driven Instant
Review (MDIR), a novel method that leverages matrix analysis and Large
Deviation Theory. MDIR achieves accurate reconstruction of weight
relationships, provides rigorous $p$-value estimation, and focuses exclusively
on weight similarity without requiring full model inference. Experimental
results demonstrate that MDIR reliably detects plagiarism even after extensive
transformations, such as random permutations and continual pretraining with
trillions of tokens. Moreover, all detections can be performed on a single PC
within an hour, making MDIR both efficient and accessible.

### [131] [Harnessing Adaptive Topology Representations for Zero-Shot Graph Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06345)
*Yanbin Wei,Jiangyue Yan,Chun Kang,Yang Chen,Hua Liu,James T. Kwok,Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出DynamicTRF框架，通过动态选择适合的图表示形式（TRF）提升大型多模态模型（LMMs）在零样本图问答任务中的准确性和简洁性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅使用单一图表示形式（TRF），无法适应不同模型或任务的需求，导致回答不准确或冗长。

Method: 分析现有TRF的优缺点，设计适合零样本图问答的TRF集合$F_{ZS}$，提出新指标GRE衡量性能与简洁性，并开发DynamicTRF框架动态选择最佳TRF。

Result: 在7个领域内算法图问答任务和2个领域外下游任务中，DynamicTRF显著提升了LMMs的零样本图问答准确性。

Conclusion: DynamicTRF通过动态TRF选择有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了图问答任务的性能。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown generalized zero-shot capabilities
in diverse domain question-answering (QA) tasks, including graph QA that
involves complex graph topologies. However, most current approaches use only a
single type of graph representation, namely Topology Representation Form (TRF),
such as prompt-unified text descriptions or style-fixed visual styles. Those
"one-size-fits-all" approaches fail to consider the specific preferences of
different models or tasks, often leading to incorrect or overly long responses.
To address this, we first analyze the characteristics and weaknesses of
existing TRFs, and then design a set of TRFs, denoted by $F_{ZS}$, tailored to
zero-shot graph QA. We then introduce a new metric, Graph Response Efficiency
(GRE), which measures the balance between the performance and the brevity in
graph QA. Built on these, we develop the DynamicTRF framework, which aims to
improve both the accuracy and conciseness of graph QA. To be specific,
DynamicTRF first creates a TRF Preference (TRFP) dataset that ranks TRFs based
on their GRE scores, to probe the question-specific TRF preferences. Then it
trains a TRF router on the TRFP dataset, to adaptively assign the best TRF from
$F_{ZS}$ for each question during the inference. Extensive experiments across 7
in-domain algorithmic graph QA tasks and 2 out-of-domain downstream tasks show
that DynamicTRF significantly enhances the zero-shot graph QA of LMMs in terms
of accuracy

*Aisha Saeid,Anu Sabu,Girish A. Koushik,Ferrante Neri,Diptesh Kanojia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了通过整合攻击性检测作为辅助任务，提升大型语言模型在社交媒体网络欺凌检测中的泛化能力和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于网络欺凌表达形式多样且隐蔽，检测难度大，研究旨在探索辅助任务（如攻击性检测）是否能提升检测效果。

Method: 实验在五个攻击性数据集和一个网络欺凌数据集上进行，评估了零样本、少样本、独立LoRA微调和多任务学习策略，最终提出了一种增强提示管道方法。

Result: 初步结果显示，增强提示管道方法优于标准LoRA微调，表明攻击性信息能显著提升网络欺凌检测效果。

Conclusion: 研究表明，辅助任务（如攻击性检测）可以提升大型语言模型在安全关键应用中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Detecting cyberbullying on social media remains a critical challenge due to
its subtle and varied expressions. This study investigates whether integrating
aggression detection as an auxiliary task within a unified training framework
can enhance the generalisation and performance of large language models (LLMs)
in cyberbullying detection. Experiments are conducted on five aggression
datasets and one cyberbullying dataset using instruction-tuned LLMs. We
evaluated multiple strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, independent LoRA
fine-tuning, and multi-task learning (MTL). Given the inconsistent results of
MTL, we propose an enriched prompt pipeline approach in which aggression
predictions are embedded into cyberbullying detection prompts to provide
contextual augmentation. Preliminary results show that the enriched prompt
pipeline consistently outperforms standard LoRA fine-tuning, indicating that
aggression-informed context significantly boosts cyberbullying detection. This
study highlights the potential of auxiliary tasks, such as aggression
detection, to improve the generalisation of LLMs for safety-critical
applications on social networks.

across three settings, domain discrimination, authorship attribution, and LLM
personalized vs non-personalized discrimination. We provide conclusive evidence
to adopt ensemble of diverse evaluation metrics to effectively evaluate style
personalized text generation.

*Lanlan Qiu,Xiao Pu,Yeqi Feng,Tianxing He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出ChatAnime数据集，结合角色扮演和情感支持能力，评估LLMs在虚拟角色情感互动中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究未结合LLMs的角色扮演和情感支持能力，研究填补这一空白，以动漫角色为案例。

Method: 选择20个动漫角色，设计60个情感场景问题，收集40名爱好者与10个LLMs的对话数据，设计9个评估指标。

Result: 表现最佳的LLMs在角色扮演和情感支持上超越人类，但人类在回答多样性上仍占优。

Conclusion: ChatAnime为优化LLMs在情感支持角色扮演中的研究提供了资源和见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
role-playing conversations and providing emotional support as separate research
directions. However, there remains a significant research gap in combining
these capabilities to enable emotionally supportive interactions with virtual
characters. To address this research gap, we focus on anime characters as a
case study because of their well-defined personalities and large fan bases.
This choice enables us to effectively evaluate how well LLMs can provide
emotional support while maintaining specific character traits. We introduce
ChatAnime, the first Emotionally Supportive Role-Playing (ESRP) dataset. We
first thoughtfully select 20 top-tier characters from popular anime communities
and design 60 emotion-centric real-world scenario questions. Then, we execute a
nationwide selection process to identify 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts with
profound knowledge of specific characters and extensive experience in
role-playing. Next, we systematically collect two rounds of dialogue data from
10 LLMs and these 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts. To evaluate the ESRP
performance of LLMs, we design a user experience-oriented evaluation system
featuring 9 fine-grained metrics across three dimensions: basic dialogue,
role-playing and emotional support, along with an overall metric for response
diversity. In total, the dataset comprises 2,400 human-written and 24,000
LLM-generated answers, supported by over 132,000 human annotations.
Experimental results show that top-performing LLMs surpass human fans in
role-playing and emotional support, while humans still lead in response
diversity. We hope this work can provide valuable resources and insights for
future research on optimizing LLMs in ESRP. Our datasets are available at
https://github.com/LanlanQiu/ChatAnime.

*Haoran Shi,Hongwei Yao,Shuo Shao,Shaopeng Jiao,Ziqi Peng,Zhan Qin,Cong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SecMCP提出了一种安全框架，通过检测和量化对话漂移来增强MCP的安全性，防止对抗性内容导致的隐私和安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCP在动态聚合实时数据时存在安全和隐私风险，现有防御方法效果不足。

Method: SecMCP通过建模LLM激活向量在潜在多面体空间中的轨迹，检测异常对话动态。

Result: 在多个LLM和数据集上验证，AUROC分数超过0.915，同时保持系统可用性。

Conclusion: SecMCP有效解决了MCP的安全威胁，为对话漂移提供了量化方法。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external tools, enabling dynamic aggregation of real-time data to
improve task execution. However, its non-isolated execution context introduces
critical security and privacy risks. In particular, adversarially crafted
content can induce tool poisoning or indirect prompt injection, leading to
conversation hijacking, misinformation propagation, or data exfiltration.
Existing defenses, such as rule-based filters or LLM-driven detection, remain
inadequate due to their reliance on static signatures, computational
inefficiency, and inability to quantify conversational hijacking. To address
these limitations, we propose SecMCP, a secure framework that detects and
quantifies conversation drift, deviations in latent space trajectories induced
by adversarial external knowledge. By modeling LLM activation vectors within a
latent polytope space, SecMCP identifies anomalous shifts in conversational
dynamics, enabling proactive detection of hijacking, misleading, and data
exfiltration. We evaluate SecMCP on three state-of-the-art LLMs (Llama3,
Vicuna, Mistral) across benchmark datasets (MS MARCO, HotpotQA, FinQA),
demonstrating robust detection with AUROC scores exceeding 0.915 while
maintaining system usability. Our contributions include a systematic
categorization of MCP security threats, a novel latent polytope-based
methodology for quantifying conversation drift, and empirical validation of
SecMCP's efficacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的代理程序记忆脆弱且依赖手动设计或静态参数，需要一种可学习、可更新的终身记忆机制。

Method: 提出Memp方法，将代理轨迹提炼为细粒度指令和高级抽象，并研究构建、检索和更新策略。

Result: 实验表明，随着记忆库的优化，代理在类似任务中的成功率和效率持续提升；强模型构建的程序记忆迁移到弱模型仍能带来显著性能提升。

Conclusion: Memp方法有效解决了代理程序记忆的脆弱性问题，支持终身学习和性能迁移。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based agents excel at diverse tasks, yet they
suffer from brittle procedural memory that is manually engineered or entangled
in static parameters. In this work, we investigate strategies to endow agents
with a learnable, updatable, and lifelong procedural memory. We propose Memp
that distills past agent trajectories into both fine-grained, step-by-step
instructions and higher-level, script-like abstractions, and explore the impact
of different strategies for Build, Retrieval, and Update of procedural memory.
Coupled with a dynamic regimen that continuously updates, corrects, and
deprecates its contents, this repository evolves in lockstep with new
experience. Empirical evaluation on TravelPlanner and ALFWorld shows that as
the memory repository is refined, agents achieve steadily higher success rates
and greater efficiency on analogous tasks. Moreover, procedural memory built
from a stronger model retains its value: migrating the procedural memory to a
weaker model yields substantial performance gains.

Conclusion: 跨语言能力无需大量多语言训练，轻量干预即可纠正偏见，开源模型提供高效低成本替代方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming social-science research by
enabling scalable, precise analysis. Their adaptability raises the question of
whether knowledge acquired through fine-tuning in a few languages can transfer
to unseen languages that only appeared during pre-training. To examine this, we
fine-tune lightweight LLaMA 3.2-3B models on monolingual, bilingual, or
multilingual data sets to classify immigration-related tweets from X/Twitter
across 13 languages, a domain characterised by polarised, culturally specific
discourse. We evaluate whether minimal language-specific fine-tuning enables
cross-lingual topic detection and whether adding targeted languages corrects
pre-training biases. Results show that LLMs fine-tuned in one or two languages
can reliably classify immigration-related content in unseen languages. However,
identifying whether a tweet expresses a pro- or anti-immigration stance
benefits from multilingual fine-tuning. Pre-training bias favours dominant
languages, but even minimal exposure to under-represented languages during
fine-tuning (as little as $9.62\times10^{-11}$ of the original pre-training
token volume) yields significant gains. These findings challenge the assumption
that cross-lingual mastery requires extensive multilingual training: limited
language coverage suffices for topic-level generalisation, and structural
biases can be corrected with lightweight interventions. By releasing
4-bit-quantised, LoRA fine-tuned models, we provide an open-source,
reproducible alternative to proprietary LLMs that delivers 35 times faster
inference at just 0.00000989% of the dollar cost of the OpenAI GPT-4o model,
enabling scalable, inclusive research.

Motivation: 探讨生成式AI对新闻诚信和作者身份的潜在影响。

Method: 分析40,000多篇新闻文章，使用三种AI文本检测工具（Binoculars、Fast-Detect GPT、GPTZero）进行检测。

Result: AI在新闻写作中的使用增加，尤其在地方和校园媒体中；AI多用于开头，人工撰写结论；AI提升了词汇丰富度和可读性，但降低了正式性。

Conclusion: 生成式AI改变了新闻写作风格，需关注其对新闻诚信的长期影响。

Abstract: The rapid rise of Generative AI (GenAI), particularly LLMs, poses concerns
for journalistic integrity and authorship. This study examines AI-generated
content across over 40,000 news articles from major, local, and college news
media, in various media formats. Using three advanced AI-text detectors (e.g.,
Binoculars, Fast-Detect GPT, and GPTZero), we find substantial increase of
GenAI use in recent years, especially in local and college news. Sentence-level
analysis reveals LLMs are often used in the introduction of news, while
conclusions usually written manually. Linguistic analysis shows GenAI boosts
word richness and readability but lowers formality, leading to more uniform
writing styles, particularly in local media.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文推理对LLM计算需求高，现有方法效率有限，需优化隐藏状态处理。

Method: 提出动态细粒度剪枝机制，逐层去除冗余令牌，并异步管理KV缓存。

Result: 实验显示，SlimInfer在LLaMA3.1-8B上实现2.53倍TTFT加速和1.88倍端到端延迟降低。

Conclusion: SlimInfer高效且不影响性能，适用于长上下文推理优化。

Abstract: Long-context inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily limited by
high computational demands. While several existing methods optimize attention
computation, they still process the full set of hidden states at each layer,
limiting overall efficiency. In this work, we propose SlimInfer, an innovative
framework that aims to accelerate inference by directly pruning less critical
prompt tokens during the forward pass. Our key insight is an information
diffusion phenomenon: As information from critical tokens propagates through
layers, it becomes distributed across the entire sequence. This diffusion
process suggests that LLMs can maintain their semantic integrity when excessive
tokens, even including these critical ones, are pruned in hidden states.
Motivated by this, SlimInfer introduces a dynamic fine-grained pruning
mechanism that accurately removes redundant tokens of hidden state at
intermediate layers. This layer-wise pruning naturally enables an asynchronous
KV cache manager that prefetches required token blocks without complex
predictors, reducing both memory usage and I/O costs. Extensive experiments
show that SlimInfer can achieve up to $\mathbf{2.53\times}$ time-to-first-token
(TTFT) speedup and $\mathbf{1.88\times}$ end-to-end latency reduction for
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct on a single RTX 4090, without sacrificing performance on
LongBench. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 论文提出HapticLLaMA模型，将触觉信号转化为自然语言描述，填补了多模态研究中触觉信号的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 触觉信号在多模态研究中较少被探索，而其在虚拟现实、无障碍和康复应用中具有潜力。

Method: 提出HapticLLaMA模型，结合频率和EnCodec两种触觉分词器，分两阶段训练：监督微调和强化学习。

Result: 模型在METEOR和BLEU-4得分上表现优异，人类评分中61%高于3.5分，强化学习提升10%评分分布。

Conclusion: HapticLLaMA展示了大型语言模型处理感官数据的潜力。

Abstract: Haptic captioning is the task of generating natural language descriptions
from haptic signals, such as vibrations, for use in virtual reality,
accessibility, and rehabilitation applications. While previous multimodal
research has focused primarily on vision and audio, haptic signals for the
sense of touch remain underexplored. To address this gap, we formalize the
haptic captioning task and propose HapticLLaMA, a multimodal sensory language
model that interprets vibration signals into descriptions in a given sensory,
emotional, or associative category. We investigate two types of haptic
tokenizers, a frequency-based tokenizer and an EnCodec-based tokenizer, that
convert haptic signals into sequences of discrete units, enabling their
integration with the LLaMA model. HapticLLaMA is trained in two stages: (1)
supervised fine-tuning using the LLaMA architecture with LoRA-based adaptation,
and (2) fine-tuning via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). We
assess HapticLLaMA's captioning performance using both automated n-gram metrics
and human evaluation. HapticLLaMA demonstrates strong capability in
interpreting haptic vibration signals, achieving a METEOR score of 59.98 and a
BLEU-4 score of 32.06 respectively. Additionally, over 61% of the generated
captions received human ratings above 3.5 on a 7-point scale, with RLHF
yielding a 10% improvement in the overall rating distribution, indicating
stronger alignment with human haptic perception. These findings highlight the
potential of large language models to process and adapt to sensory data.

Conclusion: 研究证明了通过后训练方法可以有效提升LLMs在多轮交互中的约定形成能力。

Abstract: Humans communicate with increasing efficiency in multi-turn interactions, by
adapting their language and forming ad-hoc conventions. In contrast, prior work
shows that LLMs do not naturally show this behavior. We develop a post-training
process to develop this ability through targeted fine-tuning on heuristically
identified demonstrations of convention formation. We evaluate with two new
benchmarks focused on this capability. First, we design a focused,
cognitively-motivated interaction benchmark that consistently elicits strong
convention formation trends in humans. Second, we create a new
document-grounded reference completion task that reflects in-the-wild
convention formation behavior. Our studies show significantly improved
convention formation abilities in post-trained LLMs across the two evaluation
methods.

TL;DR: 本文研究了湍流效率的上界及其饱和现象，分析了不同流动条件下的效率行为，并探讨了其与相变和分岔的相似性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究湍流效率的上界及其饱和行为，以评估实验和数值数据是否接近真实的湍流状态。

Method: 通过数值和实验数据分析不同流动（如von Kármán流、Rayleigh-Bénard对流和管流）的湍流效率。

Result: 发现湍流效率在某些情况下会饱和，且与相变和分岔的幂律行为相似；von Kármán流的效率饱和对强迫细节不敏感，Rayleigh-Bénard对流的效率在无粘极限下饱和。

Conclusion: 湍流效率的饱和现象可能有助于评估实验和数值数据是否接近真实的湍流状态，并为剪切流的动能和能量耗散缺陷定律提供解释。

Abstract: We consider the efficiency of turbulence, a dimensionless parameter that
characterises the fraction of the input energy stored into a turbulent flow
field. We first show that the inverse of the efficiency provides an upper bound
for the dimensionless energy injection in a turbulent flow. We analyse the
efficiency of turbulence for different flows using numerical and experimental
data. Our analysis suggests that efficiency is bounded from above, and, in some
cases, saturates following a power law reminiscent of phase transitions and
bifurcations. We show that for the von K{\'a}rm{\'a}n flow the efficiency
saturation is insensitive to the details of the forcing impellers. In the case
of Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard convection, we show that within the Grossman and Lohse
model, the efficiency saturates in the inviscid limit, while the dimensionless
kinetic energy injection/dissipation goes to zero. In the case of pipe flow, we
show that saturation of the efficiency cannot be excluded, but would be
incompatible with the Prandtl law of the drag friction coefficient.
Furthermore, if the power law behaviour holds for the efficiency saturation, it
can explain the kinetic energy and the energy dissipation defect laws proposed
for the shear flows. Efficiency saturation is an interesting empirical property
of turbulence that may help in evaluating the ''closeness'' of experimental and
numerical data to the true turbulent regime, wherein the kinetic energy
saturates to its inviscid limit.

Conclusion: 该模型为处理非等温两相流提供了热力学一致且数值稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: According to the dynamic van der Waals theory, we propose a thermodynamically
consistent model for non-isothermal compressible two-phase flows with contact
line motion. In this model, fluid temperature is treated as a primary variable,
characterized by the proposed temperature equation instead of being obtained
from intermediate variables such as total energy density, internal energy
density and entropy density. The hydrodynamic boundary conditions, which
represent a generalization of the generalized Navier slip boundary condition in
non-isothermal flows, are imposed on the proposed model. We then develop the
dimensionless form of the model and prove that it rigorously satisfies the
first and second laws of thermodynamics. Two numerical schemes based on the
dimensionless system are constructed: one is fully coupled and
thermodynamically consistent, namely strictly satisfying the temporally
discrete first and second laws of thermodynamics; the other, designed by
extending the multiple scalar auxiliary variable approach to entropy
production, is decoupled, linear, and unconditionally entropy-stable. Several
numerical results are presented to validate the effectiveness and stability of
the proposed method.

Conclusion: 模型在中等频率范围内与实验数据高度一致，验证了建模策略的有效性。

Abstract: The importance of wavepackets in the generation of mixing noise in twin jets
is expected by extrapolation of the insights previously obtained from the study
of single isolated jets. This work presents wavepacket models for supersonic
round twin jets operating at perfectly-expanded conditions, computed via
plane-marching parabolized stability equations based on mean flows obtained
from the compressible RANS equations. High-speed schlieren visualizations and
non-time-resolved PIV measurements are performed to obtain experimental
datasets for validating the modelling strategy. The RANS solutions are found to
be in good quantitative agreement with the PIV mean-flow measurements,
confirming the ability of the approach to capture the interaction between jets
at the mean-flow level. The obtained wavepackets consist of toroidal and
flapping fluctuations of the twin-jet system, and show similarities with those
of single axisymmetric jets. However, for the case of closely-spaced jets, they
exhibit deviations in the phase speed of structures travelling in the outer
mixing layer and those travelling in the inner one, leading to different
non-axisymmetric behaviours. In particular, toroidal twin-jet wavepackets
feature tilted ring-like structures with respect to the jet axis, while
flapping twin-jet wavepackets are distorted and lose the clean checkerboard
pattern typically observed in $m = 1$ modes in axisymmetric jets. A
quantitative comparison of the modelled wavepackets with experimentally-educed
coherent structures is performed in terms of their structural agreement
measured through an alignment coefficient, providing a first validation of the
modelling strategy. Alignment coefficients are found to be particularly high in
the intermediate range of studied frequencies.

Conclusion: 粗糙度元素的几何排列决定了二次流的平均结构和时间行为，为工程应用提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Secondary flows induced by spanwise heterogeneous surface roughness play a
crucial role in determining engineering-relevant metrics such as surface drag,
convective heat transfer, and the transport of airborne scalars. While much of
the existing literature has focused on idealized configurations with regularly
spaced roughness elements, real-world surfaces often feature irregularities,
clustering, and topographic complexity for which the secondary flow response
remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we investigate multi-column
roughness configurations that serve as a regularized analog of roughness
clustering. Using large-eddy simulations, we systematically examine the effects
of cluster density and local arrangement on secondary flows, and observe that
varying the cluster density gives rise to distinct secondary flow polarities.
Through a systematic parameter study, we identify the spanwise gap between the
edge-most roughness elements of adjacent columns, normalized by the channel
half-height, as a key geometric factor governing this polarity. In addition to
analyzing the time-averaged structure, we investigate how variations in
polarity affect the instantaneous dynamics of secondary flows. Here, we find
that the regions of high- and low-momentum fluid created by the secondary flows
alternate in a chaotic, non-periodic manner over time. Further analysis of the
vertical velocity signal shows that variability in vertical momentum transport
is a persistent and intrinsic feature of secondary flow dynamics. Taken
together, these findings provide a comprehensive picture of how the geometric
arrangement of roughness elements governs both the mean structure and temporal
behavior of secondary flows.

Motivation: 探索复杂流动中的稳定性问题，特别是涡旋脱落和射流摆动对流动的影响。

Method: 采用谱本征正交分解（SPOD）分析流动特性，进行Lyapunov稳定性分析，计算协变Lyapunov向量（CLVs），并结合全局线性稳定性分析（GLSA）。

Result: 发现流动具有两个正Lyapunov指数，CLVs揭示了不同不稳定区域，SPOD提取了主导相干结构和振荡频率。GLSA的局限性在混沌流动中显现。

Conclusion: Lyapunov分析揭示了GLSA在混沌流动中的不足，为复杂流动稳定性研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: We investigate the stability of the flow past two side-by-side square
cylinders (at Reynolds number 200 and gap ratio 1) using tools from dynamical
systems theory. The flow is highly irregular due to the complex interaction
between the flapping jet emanating from the gap and the vortices shed in the
wake. We first perform Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (SPOD) to
understand the flow characteristics. We then conduct Lyapunov stability
analysis by linearizing the Navier-Stokes equations around the irregular base
flow and find that it has two positive Lyapunov exponents. The Covariant
Lyapunov Vectors (CLVs) are also computed. Contours of the time-averaged CLVs
reveal that the footprint of the leading CLV is in the near-wake, whereas the
other CLVs peak further downstream, indicating distinct regions of instability.
SPOD of the two unstable CLVs is then employed to extract the dominant coherent
structures and oscillation frequencies in the tangent space. For the leading
CLV, the two dominant frequencies match closely with the prevalent frequencies
in the drag coefficient spectrum, and correspond to instabilities due to vortex
shedding and jet-flapping. The second unstable CLV captures the subharmonic
instability of the shedding frequency. Global linear stability analysis (GLSA)
of the time-averaged flow identifies a neutral eigenmode that resembles the
leading SPOD mode of the first CLV, with a very similar structure and
frequency. However, while GLSA predicts neutrality, Lyapunov analysis reveals
that this direction is unstable, exposing the inherent limitations of the GLSA
when applied to chaotic flows.

Conclusion: 温度与液滴尺寸对冻结时间影响显著，研究结果与文献一致且创新性地考虑了运动效应。

Abstract: In microfluidic devices, droplets serving as carriers for chemical reactors
or biomass can form stably encapsulated particles during the freezing process,
holding significant importance in pharmaceuticals and microchemical reaction
control. This study couples the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method with an
enthalpy-porous media phase change model to distinguish the water (ice)-oil
two-phase system and the water-ice two-phase system, respectively.The
simulation reveals two distinct solidification patterns: Pattern I exhibits a
uniform and symmetric pattern, occurring at lower Reynolds numbers (Re) or
droplet-to-channel diameter ratios (D/W), resulting in a relatively even solid
shell along the interface with synchronized solidification fronts in both flow
and spanwise directions, dominated by heat conduction. Pattern II shows a
shear-constraint cooperative non-uniform pattern at higher Reynolds numbers and
D/W ratios, where flow dynamics and spatial confinement couple, leading to
faster solidification at the tail region and an asymmetric solidification
front. Through comprehensive analysis of the numerical results, we derived the
characteristic behavior of the Stefan number (Ste), Reynolds number (Re), and
D/W ratios on the freezing time. We established a unified scaling relation for
the freezing time: t_\text{final}\sim18.02 S t e^{-0.91}{ Re }^{-0.12} (D /
W)^{1.42} . The results demonstrates that increasing Stefan number and Reynolds
number shortens the freezing time, whereas increasing droplet D/W ratio extends
it. Furthermore, the fitted coefficients reveals that temperature and droplet
size exert a more pronounced influence on droplet freezing. Our results
demonstrate good consistency with those in the literature, while indeed
incorporating the effects of motion, which represents a novel aspect.

Conclusion: 研究深化了对浅水波行为的理解，为后续探索提供了统一框架。

Abstract: The Whitham Broer Kaup (WBK) equations provide a fundamental framework for
modeling shallow water wave dynamics, effectively capturing both nonlinear and
dispersive effects. In this study, we construct a new class of analytical and
numerical solutions for the WBK system using Lie symmetry analysis. By
determining an optimal system of one-dimensional subalgebras, we obtain
symmetry reductions that lead to new kinds of exact wave solutions expressed in
hyperbolic, trigonometric, and rational forms. The influence of key physical
parameters on wave structure is systematically explored, revealing their role
in shaping the velocity and surface profiles of the waves. An important aspect
of this work is the application of the WBK model to tsunami wave propagation,
demonstrating its capability to simulate the generation, evolution, and spatial
spreading of long surface waves in coastal regions. This highlights the
practical relevance of the WBK equations in geophysical and oceanographic
contexts. Additionally, employing the direct multiplier method, we derive a
complete set of local conservation laws for the governing WBK model, ensuring
the preservation of key physical properties. These findings enhance the
understanding of shallow water wave behavior, unify existing research, and
provide a framework for further exploration.

Conclusion: 研究为自然对流在垂直通道中的应用提供了重要见解，强调了高宽比和下游流体行为对流动特性的影响。

Abstract: Understanding the thermal and flow fields associated with natural convection
is of great importance in the design and manufacture of passive cooling
systems, solar collectors, and ventilation systems. The aim of this study is to
numerically investigate the naturally driven flow behaviour in open-ended
vertical channels. Specifically, laminar airflow (Rayleigh number of 5*10^5) is
naturally driven through a vertical channel that is asymmetrically heated with
a uniform heat flux of (2043 w/m^2) . The compressible OpenFOAM solver
(buoyantPimpleFoam) is employed, and open boundary conditions are applied at
both the inlet and outlet to account for the effect of ventilation. The results
exhibit good agreement with a numerical benchmark. Furthermore, a study of the
airflow through two vertical channels, with two different aspect ratios of 5
and 31.25, is conducted. The results indicate that, in both cases of aspect
ratios, the flow accelerates near the heated wall and decelerates near the
adiabatic wall, forming a near-constant velocity region around the channel
centreline. Increasing the aspect ratio diminishes the reverse flow. However,
the flow pattern near the heated wall remains largely unaffected by aspect
ratio changes. Additionally, the fluid behaviour downstream significantly
affects velocity measurements at the inlet.

Conclusion: AEPO有效解决了语义对齐的探索问题，为MLLMs在GUI任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has propelled the
development of autonomous agents that operate on Graphical User Interfaces
(GUIs) using pure visual input. A fundamental challenge is robustly grounding
natural language instructions. This requires a precise spatial alignment, which
accurately locates the coordinates of each element, and, more critically, a
correct semantic alignment, which matches the instructions to the functionally
appropriate UI element. Although Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) has proven to be effective at improving spatial alignment for these
MLLMs, we find that inefficient exploration bottlenecks semantic alignment,
which prevent models from learning difficult semantic associations. To address
this exploration problem, we present Adaptive Exploration Policy Optimization
(AEPO), a new policy optimization framework. AEPO employs a multi-answer
generation strategy to enforce broader exploration, which is then guided by a
theoretically grounded Adaptive Exploration Reward (AER) function derived from
first principles of efficiency eta=U/C. Our AEPO-trained models, InfiGUI-G1-3B
and InfiGUI-G1-7B, establish new state-of-the-art results across multiple
challenging GUI grounding benchmarks, achieving significant relative
improvements of up to 9.0% against the naive RLVR baseline on benchmarks
designed to test generalization and semantic understanding. Resources are

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for developing safe Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI) by combining Active Inference principles with Large Language
Models (LLMs). We argue that traditional approaches to AI safety, focused on
post-hoc interpretability and reward engineering, have fundamental limitations.
We present an architecture where safety guarantees are integrated into the
system's core design through transparent belief representations and
hierarchical value alignment. Our framework leverages natural language as a
medium for representing and manipulating beliefs, enabling direct human
oversight while maintaining computational tractability. The architecture
implements a multi-agent system where agents self-organize according to Active
Inference principles, with preferences and safety constraints flowing through
hierarchical Markov blankets. We outline specific mechanisms for ensuring
safety, including: (1) explicit separation of beliefs and preferences in
natural language, (2) bounded rationality through resource-aware free energy
minimization, and (3) compositional safety through modular agent structures.
The paper concludes with a research agenda centered on the Abstraction and
Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark, proposing experiments to validate our
framework's safety properties. Our approach offers a path toward AGI
development that is inherently safer, rather than retrofitted with safety
measures.

Abstract: Some of the strongest evidence that human minds should be thought about in
terms of symbolic systems has been the way they combine ideas, produce novelty,
and learn quickly. We argue that modern neural networks -- and the artificial
intelligence systems built upon them -- exhibit similar abilities. This
undermines the argument that the cognitive processes and representations used
by human minds are symbolic, although the fact that these neural networks are
typically trained on data generated by symbolic systems illustrates that such
systems play an important role in characterizing the abstract problems that
human minds have to solve. This argument leads us to offer a new agenda for
research on the symbolic basis of human thought.

Abstract: Current eXplainable AI (XAI) methods largely serve developers, often focusing
on justifying model outputs rather than supporting diverse stakeholder needs. A
recent shift toward Evaluative AI reframes explanation as a tool for hypothesis
testing, but still focuses primarily on operational organizations. We introduce
Holistic-XAI (H-XAI), a unified framework that integrates causal rating methods
with traditional XAI methods to support explanation as an interactive,
multi-method process. H-XAI allows stakeholders to ask a series of questions,
test hypotheses, and compare model behavior against automatically constructed
random and biased baselines. It combines instance-level and global
explanations, adapting to each stakeholder's goals, whether understanding
individual decisions, assessing group-level bias, or evaluating robustness
under perturbations. We demonstrate the generality of our approach through two
case studies spanning six scenarios: binary credit risk classification and
financial time-series forecasting. H-XAI fills critical gaps left by existing
XAI methods by combining causal ratings and post-hoc explanations to answer
stakeholder-specific questions at both the individual decision level and the
overall model level.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance and gain influence, the

navigation into critical applications raises substantial safety concerns. Given
their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments, ensuring the safety of
such systems is critical. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of
safety in embodied navigation from multiple perspectives, encompassing attack
strategies, defense mechanisms, and evaluation methodologies. Beyond conducting
a comprehensive examination of existing safety challenges, mitigation
technologies, and various datasets and metrics that assess effectiveness and
robustness, we explore unresolved issues and future research directions in
embodied navigation safety. These include potential attack methods, mitigation
strategies, more reliable evaluation techniques, and the implementation of
verification frameworks. By addressing these critical gaps, this survey aims to
provide valuable insights that can guide future research toward the development
of safer and more reliable embodied navigation systems. Furthermore, the
findings of this study have broader implications for enhancing societal safety

*Sahil Bansal,Sai Shruthi Sistla,Aarti Arikatala,Sebastian Schreiber*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于知识图谱（KG）的工具检索框架，通过捕捉工具间的语义关系和功能依赖，显著提高了多步任务中的工具检索准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工具检索方法主要依赖用户查询与工具描述的相似性，限制了多步请求的处理能力。本文旨在通过KG解决这一问题。

Method: 采用基于KG的检索框架，利用1-hop ego工具图集合建模工具间的直接和间接连接，实现更全面的工具选择。

Result: 在合成数据集上，该方法在Complete Recall指标上达到91.85%的工具覆盖率，优于非KG基线方法的89.26%。

Conclusion: KG的结构信息为相似性匹配提供了补充信号，特别适用于需要顺序工具组合的查询。

Abstract: Effective tool retrieval is essential for AI agents to select from a vast
array of tools when identifying and planning actions in the context of complex
user queries. Despite its central role in planning, this aspect remains
underexplored in the literature. Traditional approaches rely primarily on
similarities between user queries and tool descriptions, which significantly
limits retrieval accuracy, specifically when handling multi-step user requests.
To address these limitations, we propose a Knowledge Graph (KG)-based tool
retrieval framework that captures the semantic relationships between tools and
their functional dependencies. Our retrieval algorithm leverages ensembles of
1-hop ego tool graphs to model direct and indirect connections between tools,
enabling more comprehensive and contextual tool selection for multi-step tasks.
We evaluate our approach on a synthetically generated internal dataset across
six defined user classes, extending previous work on coherent dialogue
synthesis and too retrieval benchmarks. Results demonstrate that our tool
graph-based method achieves 91.85% tool coverage on the micro-average Complete
Recall metric, compared to 89.26% for re-ranked semantic-lexical hybrid
retrieval, the strongest non-KG baseline in our experiments. These findings
support our hypothesis that the structural information in the KG provides
complementary signals to pure similarity matching, particularly for queries
requiring sequential tool composition.

TL;DR: 提出MedOrch框架，通过LLM中介协调多VLM专家代理协作，提升医疗多模态决策能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多代理研究多限于语言任务，多模态场景下VLMs协作能力不足，需解决错误结果放大和自反思能力差的问题。

Method: 采用LLM中介代理协调多个VLM专家代理，利用开源通用和领域专用VLMs，实现协作与反思。

Result: 在五项医疗视觉问答基准测试中表现优异，协作性能超越单代理，无需额外训练。

Conclusion: 中介引导的多代理协作框架可显著提升医疗多模态智能，凸显异构模型协作价值。

Abstract: Complex medical decision-making involves cooperative workflows operated by
different clinicians. Designing AI multi-agent systems can expedite and augment
human-level clinical decision-making. Existing multi-agent researches primarily
focus on language-only tasks, yet their extension to multimodal scenarios
remains challenging. A blind combination of diverse vision-language models
(VLMs) can amplify an erroneous outcome interpretation. VLMs in general are
less capable in instruction following and importantly self-reflection, compared
to large language models (LLMs) of comparable sizes. This disparity largely
constrains VLMs' ability in cooperative workflows. In this study, we propose
MedOrch, a mediator-guided multi-agent collaboration framework for medical
multimodal decision-making. MedOrch employs an LLM-based mediator agent that
enables multiple VLM-based expert agents to exchange and reflect on their
outputs towards collaboration. We utilize multiple open-source general-purpose
and domain-specific VLMs instead of costly GPT-series models, revealing the
strength of heterogeneous models. We show that the collaboration within
distinct VLM-based agents can surpass the capabilities of any individual agent.
We validate our approach on five medical vision question answering benchmarks,
demonstrating superior collaboration performance without model training. Our
findings underscore the value of mediator-guided multi-agent collaboration in
advancing medical multimodal intelligence. Our code will be made publicly
available.

*Daechul Ahn,San Kim,Jonghyun Choi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分层多智能体框架HIMA，结合专家模仿学习和元控制器，解决了LLM在动态长时任务（如《星际争霸II》）中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的方法在动态、长时任务（如《星际争霸II》）中表现不佳，难以处理资源约束和部分可观测环境。

Method: 提出HIMA框架，通过专家模仿学习训练多个专用智能体，并由元控制器Strategic Planner协调其策略。

Result: HIMA在战略清晰性、适应性和计算效率上优于现有方法，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 结合专用模仿模块与元级协调，可开发更鲁棒、通用的AI智能体。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive action
sequence prediction capabilities but often struggle with dynamic, long-horizon
tasks such as real-time strategic games. In a game such as StarCraftII (SC2),
agents need to manage resource constraints and adapt to evolving battlefield
situations in a partially observable environment. This often overwhelms
exisiting LLM-based approaches. To address these challenges, we propose a
hierarchical multi-agent framework that employs specialized imitation learning
agents under a meta-controller called Strategic Planner (SP). By expert
demonstrations, each specialized agent learns a distinctive strategy, such as
aerial support or defensive maneuvers, and produces coherent, structured
multistep action sequences. The SP then orchestrates these proposals into a
single, environmentally adaptive plan that ensures local decisions aligning
with long-term strategies. We call this HIMA (Hierarchical Imitation
Multi-Agent). We also present TEXTSCII-ALL, a comprehensive SC2 testbed that
encompasses all race match combinations in SC2. Our empirical results show that
HIMA outperforms state of the arts in strategic clarity, adaptability, and
computational efficiency, underscoring the potential of combining specialized
imitation modules with meta-level orchestration to develop more robust,
general-purpose AI agents.

*Sankarshan Damle,Boi Faltings*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个双用途框架，利用参与式预算（PB）来评估大语言模型（LLMs）在资源分配中的能力，并作为动态基准测试其推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在复杂决策任务中的应用日益增多，但其在结构化资源分配中的能力尚未充分探索，且现有基准测试存在数据污染和静态性问题。

Method: 通过三种提示策略（贪心选择、直接优化和启发式改进）让LLMs在预算约束下选择项目子集，并对比效用最大化基准。同时测试LLMs能否从自然语言输入中推断结构化偏好。

Result: 结果表明提示设计对LLMs表现至关重要，且LLMs在机制设计和处理非结构化输入方面具有潜力。

Conclusion: LLMs在资源分配和偏好推断方面展现出潜力，提示设计是关键因素。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to handle complex
decision-making tasks, yet their ability to perform structured resource
allocation remains underexplored. Evaluating their reasoning is also difficult
due to data contamination and the static nature of existing benchmarks. We
present a dual-purpose framework leveraging Participatory Budgeting (PB) both
as (i) a practical setting for LLM-based resource allocation and (ii) an
adaptive benchmark for evaluating their reasoning capabilities. We task LLMs
with selecting project subsets under feasibility (e.g., budget) constraints via
three prompting strategies: greedy selection, direct optimization, and a
hill-climbing-inspired refinement. We benchmark LLMs' allocations against a
utility-maximizing oracle. Interestingly, we also test whether LLMs can infer
structured preferences from natural-language voter input or metadata, without
explicit votes. By comparing allocations based on inferred preferences to those
from ground-truth votes, we evaluate LLMs' ability to extract preferences from
open-ended input. Our results underscore the role of prompt design and show
that LLMs hold promise for mechanism design with unstructured inputs.

### [161] [Don't Forget Imagination!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06062)
*Evgenii E. Vityaev,Andrei Mantsivoda*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文呼吁重视认知想象力在人工智能中的关键作用，并提出语义模型作为模拟认知想象力的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 认知想象力在人类思维中扮演重要角色，但目前在AI领域被低估，导致AI能力受限。

Method: 提出语义模型，一种基于概率因果关系的数学模型，能够学习和确保想象上下文的连贯性。

Result: 语义模型能够模拟认知想象力，支持连贯的推理和决策。

Conclusion: 认知想象力是AI未来的重要突破方向，语义模型为实现这一目标提供了可行工具。

Abstract: Cognitive imagination is a type of imagination that plays a key role in human
thinking. It is not a ``picture-in-the-head'' imagination. It is a faculty to
mentally visualize coherent and holistic systems of concepts and causal links
that serve as semantic contexts for reasoning, decision making and prediction.
Our position is that the role of cognitive imagination is still greatly
underestimated, and this creates numerous problems and diminishes the current
capabilities of AI. For instance, when reasoning, humans rely on imaginary
contexts to retrieve background info. They also constantly return to the
context for semantic verification that their reasoning is still reasonable.
Thus, reasoning without imagination is blind. This paper is a call for greater
attention to cognitive imagination as the next promising breakthrough in
artificial intelligence. As an instrument for simulating cognitive imagination,
we propose semantic models -- a new approach to mathematical models that can
learn, like neural networks, and are based on probabilistic causal
relationships. Semantic models can simulate cognitive imagination because they
ensure the consistency of imaginary contexts and implement a glass-box approach
that allows the context to be manipulated as a holistic and coherent system of
interrelated facts glued together with causal relations.

### [162] [A Generic Complete Anytime Beam Search for Optimal Decision Tree](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06064)
*Harold Silvère Kiossou,Siegfried Nijssen,Pierre Schaus*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通用的、完整的、随时可用的CA-DL8.5算法，用于优化决策树分类问题，并通过实验验证其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有精确算法在未完成搜索时表现不佳，缺乏系统比较，因此需要一种更高效的随时可用方法。

Method: CA-DL8.5是一种基于DL8.5框架的通用光束搜索算法，结合了多种启发式和松弛机制。

Result: 实验表明，CA-DL8.5的LDS变体在随时性能上表现最佳，优于其他变体和Blossom算法。

Conclusion: CA-DL8.5为决策树学习提供了一个灵活且高效的框架，同时保持了最优性和完整性。

Abstract: Finding an optimal decision tree that minimizes classification error is known
to be NP-hard. While exact algorithms based on MILP, CP, SAT, or dynamic
programming guarantee optimality, they often suffer from poor anytime behavior
-- meaning they struggle to find high-quality decision trees quickly when the
search is stopped before completion -- due to unbalanced search space
exploration. To address this, several anytime extensions of exact methods have
been proposed, such as LDS-DL8.5, Top-k-DL8.5, and Blossom, but they have not
been systematically compared, making it difficult to assess their relative
effectiveness. In this paper, we propose CA-DL8.5, a generic, complete, and
anytime beam search algorithm that extends the DL8.5 framework and unifies some
existing anytime strategies. In particular, CA-DL8.5 generalizes previous
approaches LDS-DL8.5 and Top-k-DL8.5, by allowing the integration of various
heuristics and relaxation mechanisms through a modular design. The algorithm
reuses DL8.5's efficient branch-and-bound pruning and trie-based caching,
combined with a restart-based beam search that gradually relaxes pruning
criteria to improve solution quality over time. Our contributions are twofold:
(1) We introduce this new generic framework for exact and anytime decision tree
learning, enabling the incorporation of diverse heuristics and search
strategies; (2) We conduct a rigorous empirical comparison of several
instantiations of CA-DL8.5 -- based on Purity, Gain, Discrepancy, and Top-k
heuristics -- using an anytime evaluation metric called the primal gap
integral. Experimental results on standard classification benchmarks show that
CA-DL8.5 using LDS (limited discrepancy) consistently provides the best anytime
performance, outperforming both other CA-DL8.5 variants and the Blossom
algorithm while maintaining completeness and optimality guarantees.

*Siyi Lu,Run Liu,Dongsheng Yang,Lei He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度强化学习和鸟瞰图感知的新型自动驾驶框架，结合高效的时空特征提取网络，显著提升了实时决策性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模块化方法存在错误传播和协调问题，端到端学习方法则面临计算瓶颈，因此需要一种既能简化设计又能提升性能的解决方案。

Method: 采用深度强化学习（DRL）结合鸟瞰图（BEV）感知，提出Mamba-BEV模型进行时空特征提取，并进一步开发ME³-BEV框架用于端到端决策。

Result: 在CARLA模拟器中，ME³-BEV在碰撞率和轨迹精度等指标上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 该框架为实时自动驾驶提供了一种高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems face significant challenges in perceiving complex
environments and making real-time decisions. Traditional modular approaches,
while offering interpretability, suffer from error propagation and coordination
issues, whereas end-to-end learning systems can simplify the design but face
computational bottlenecks. This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous
driving using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that integrates bird's-eye view
(BEV) perception for enhanced real-time decision-making. We introduce the
\texttt{Mamba-BEV} model, an efficient spatio-temporal feature extraction
network that combines BEV-based perception with the Mamba framework for
temporal feature modeling. This integration allows the system to encode vehicle
surroundings and road features in a unified coordinate system and accurately
model long-range dependencies. Building on this, we propose the
\texttt{ME$^3$-BEV} framework, which utilizes the \texttt{Mamba-BEV} model as a
feature input for end-to-end DRL, achieving superior performance in dynamic
urban driving scenarios. We further enhance the interpretability of the model
by visualizing high-dimensional features through semantic segmentation,
providing insight into the learned representations. Extensive experiments on
the CARLA simulator demonstrate that \texttt{ME$^3$-BEV} outperforms existing
models across multiple metrics, including collision rate and trajectory
accuracy, offering a promising solution for real-time autonomous driving.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文解决了关于图神经网络（GNNs）逻辑表达能力的一个开放性问题，证明其表达能力严格超过C2逻辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GNNs的逻辑表达能力，并解决Barceló等人提出的未解决问题。

Method: 通过理论分析，比较GNNs与C2逻辑的表达能力。

Result: 证明GNNs的逻辑表达能力严格超过C2逻辑，适用于无向和有向图。

Conclusion: 研究不仅对GNNs有重要意义，还为无穷逻辑的表达能力提供了新见解。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding the
expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) by relating them to logical
languages. This research has been been initialised by an influential result of
Barcel\'o et al. (2020), who showed that the graded modal logic (or a guarded
fragment of the logic C2), characterises the logical expressiveness of
aggregate-combine GNNs. As a ``challenging open problem'' they left the
question whether full C2 characterises the logical expressiveness of
aggregate-combine-readout GNNs. This question has remained unresolved despite
several attempts. In this paper, we solve the above open problem by proving
that the logical expressiveness of aggregate-combine-readout GNNs strictly
exceeds that of C2. This result holds over both undirected and directed graphs.
Beyond its implications for GNNs, our work also leads to purely logical
insights on the expressive power of infinitary logics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PanelTR框架通过LLM代理科学家实现表格推理，无需依赖标注数据或复杂增强，性能优于普通LLM，媲美监督模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决表格推理任务中依赖标注数据或复杂数据增强的限制，以及LLM在此类任务中表现不佳的问题。

Method: PanelTR框架采用五类科学家角色，通过个体调查、自审和协作评审的流程，实现语义级迁移。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，PanelTR性能超越普通LLM，媲美监督模型，且无需训练数据。

Conclusion: 结构化科学方法能有效处理复杂任务，支持零样本下的灵活语义理解。

Abstract: Table reasoning, including tabular QA and fact verification, often depends on
annotated data or complex data augmentation, limiting flexibility and
generalization. LLMs, despite their versatility, often underperform compared to
simple supervised models. To approach these issues, we introduce PanelTR, a
framework utilizing LLM agent scientists for robust table reasoning through a
structured scientific approach. PanelTR's workflow involves agent scientists
conducting individual investigations, engaging in self-review, and
participating in collaborative peer-review discussions. This process, driven by
five scientist personas, enables semantic-level transfer without relying on
data augmentation or parametric optimization. Experiments across four
benchmarks show that PanelTR outperforms vanilla LLMs and rivals fully
supervised models, all while remaining independent of training data. Our
findings indicate that structured scientific methodology can effectively handle
complex tasks beyond table reasoning with flexible semantic understanding in a
zero-shot context.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SKATE是一种新型评估框架，通过让大语言模型（LLMs）相互生成和解决可验证任务来评估其能力，具有自动化、可扩展和客观性等优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估方法需要大量领域专业知识，难以跟上LLMs的快速发展，因此需要一种更通用、可扩展的评估框架。

Method: SKATE将评估视为游戏，LLMs既作为任务生成者又作为解决者，通过生成可验证任务（如代码输出预测挑战）来相互测试，并使用TrueSkill排名系统评估模型。

Result: 实验表明，较弱模型能可靠区分较强模型，LLMs会生成偏向自身能力的任务，SKATE能自动揭示模型间的细粒度能力差异。

Conclusion: SKATE为通用、可扩展的LLM评估框架提供了重要进展，能够跟上LLMs的发展步伐。

Abstract: Evaluating the capabilities and risks of foundation models is paramount, yet
current methods demand extensive domain expertise, hindering their scalability
as these models rapidly evolve. We introduce SKATE: a novel evaluation
framework in which large language models (LLMs) compete by generating and
solving verifiable tasks for one another. Our core insight is to treat
evaluation as a game: models act as both task-setters and solvers, incentivized
to create questions which highlight their own strengths while exposing others'
weaknesses. SKATE offers several key advantages, balancing scalability,
open-endedness, and objectivity. It is fully automated, data-free, and
scalable, requiring no human input or domain expertise. By using verifiable
tasks rather than LLM judges, scoring is objective. Unlike domain-limited
programmatically-generated benchmarks (e.g. chess-playing or spatial
reasoning), having LLMs creatively pose challenges enables open-ended and
scalable evaluation. As a proof of concept, we introduce LLM-set
code-output-prediction (COP) challenges as a verifiable and extensible
framework in which to test our approach. Using a TrueSkill-based ranking
system, we evaluate six frontier LLMs and find that: (1) weaker models can
reliably differentiate and score stronger ones, (2) LLM-based systems are
capable of self-preferencing behavior, generating questions that align with
their own capabilities, and (3) SKATE automatically surfaces fine-grained
capability differences between models. Our findings are an important step
towards general, scalable evaluation frameworks which can keep pace with LLM
progress.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统元启发式算法依赖人工设计，研究探索机器学习方法利用组合优化解的结构特征，以提升算法效率。

Method: 使用多种分类模型进行敏感性分析，结合可解释AI技术理解模型决策机制。

Result: 特征重要性因模型而异，但某些特征始终是强预测因子；提出统一框架量化特征影响。

Conclusion: 特征重要性分析可作为改进VRP元启发式算法的基础指导机制。

Abstract: The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a complex optimization problem with
numerous real-world applications, mostly solved using metaheuristic algorithms
due to its $\mathcal{NP}$-Hard nature. Traditionally, these metaheuristics rely
on human-crafted designs developed through empirical studies. However, recent
research shows that machine learning methods can be used the structural
characteristics of solutions in combinatorial optimization, thereby aiding in
designing more efficient algorithms, particularly for solving VRP. Building on
this advancement, this study extends the previous research by conducting a
sensitivity analysis using multiple classifier models that are capable of
predicting the quality of VRP solutions. Hence, by leveraging explainable AI,
this research is able to extend the understanding of how these models make
decisions. Finally, our findings indicate that while feature importance varies,
certain features consistently emerge as strong predictors. Furthermore, we
propose a unified framework able of ranking feature impact across different
scenarios to illustrate this finding. These insights highlight the potential of
feature importance analysis as a foundation for developing a guidance mechanism
of metaheuristic algorithms for solving the VRP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在医疗保健领域的应用，尤其是在药物禁忌方面，需要高准确性和可靠性信息。

Method: 使用OpenAI的GPT-4o-mini作为基础模型，结合text-embedding-3-small模型和Langchain，构建了一个混合检索系统，并利用公共数据库中的药物使用审查（DUR）数据。

Result: RAG框架显著提升了模型准确性，在年龄组、妊娠和联合用药三个类别的禁忌问题上，准确率分别达到0.94、0.87和0.89。

Conclusion: 研究表明，RAG框架可以有效减少药物禁忌信息的不确定性，为处方和用药决策提供更精确的支持。

Abstract: The versatility of large language models (LLMs) has been explored across
various sectors, but their application in healthcare poses challenges,
particularly in the domain of pharmaceutical contraindications where accurate
and reliable information is required. This study enhances the capability of
LLMs to address contraindications effectively by implementing a Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. Utilizing OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini as the base
model, and the text-embedding-3-small model for embeddings, our approach
integrates Langchain to orchestrate a hybrid retrieval system with re-ranking.
This system leverages Drug Utilization Review (DUR) data from public databases,
focusing on contraindications for specific age groups, pregnancy, and
concomitant drug use. The dataset includes 300 question-answer pairs across
three categories, with baseline model accuracy ranging from 0.49 to 0.57.
Post-integration of the RAG pipeline, we observed a significant improvement in
model accuracy, achieving rates of 0.94, 0.87, and 0.89 for contraindications
related to age groups, pregnancy, and concomitant drug use, respectively. The
results indicate that augmenting LLMs with a RAG framework can substantially
reduce uncertainty in prescription and drug intake decisions by providing more
precise and reliable drug contraindication information.

Motivation: 现有LLM评估方法过于关注准确性，忽略了置信度校准的重要性，导致实际部署中的可靠性问题。

Method: 提出TH-Score量化置信度与准确性的对齐，并设计LLM-as-a-Fuser框架，通过集成方法提升评估的可靠性和风险感知能力。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著改善了置信度校准，实现了自适应评估，并在可靠性和准确性上优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 置信度驱动的风险感知评估系统是提升LLM作为评估工具可靠性的关键。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as automated judges, where
practical value depends on both accuracy and trustworthy, risk-aware judgments.
Existing approaches predominantly focus on accuracy, overlooking the necessity
of well-calibrated confidence, which is vital for adaptive and reliable
evaluation pipelines. In this work, we advocate a shift from accuracy-centric
evaluation to confidence-driven, risk-aware LLM-as-a-Judge systems, emphasizing
the necessity of well-calibrated confidence for trustworthy and adaptive
evaluation. We systematically identify the **Overconfidence Phenomenon** in
current LLM-as-a-Judges, where predicted confidence significantly overstates
actual correctness, undermining reliability in practical deployment. To
quantify this phenomenon, we introduce **TH-Score**, a novel metric measuring
confidence-accuracy alignment. Furthermore, we propose **LLM-as-a-Fuser**, an
ensemble framework that transforms LLMs into reliable, risk-aware evaluators.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves
calibration and enables adaptive, confidence-driven evaluation pipelines,
achieving superior reliability and accuracy compared to existing baselines.

TL;DR: GeoLaux是一个新的几何问题解决基准，专注于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的长步推理和辅助线构造能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准忽视辅助线构造和细粒度过程评估，无法全面评估MLLMs的几何推理能力。

Method: 构建包含2,186个几何问题的GeoLaux数据集，设计五维评估策略（答案正确性、过程正确性、过程质量、辅助线影响、错误原因）。

Result: 实验发现MLLMs在长步推理中性能显著下降，倾向于在证明问题中走捷径，且缺乏辅助线意识。

Conclusion: GeoLaux可作为评估MLLMs几何推理能力的基准，并指导模型能力提升。

Abstract: Geometry problem solving (GPS) requires models to master diagram
comprehension, logical reasoning, knowledge application, numerical computation,
and auxiliary line construction. This presents a significant challenge for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing benchmarks for
evaluating MLLM geometry skills overlook auxiliary line construction and lack
fine-grained process evaluation, making them insufficient for assessing MLLMs'
long-step reasoning abilities. To bridge these gaps, we present the GeoLaux
benchmark, comprising 2,186 geometry problems, incorporating both calculation
and proving questions. Notably, the problems require an average of 6.51
reasoning steps, with a maximum of 24 steps, and 41.8% of them need auxiliary
line construction. Building on the dataset, we design a novel five-dimensional
evaluation strategy assessing answer correctness, process correctness, process
quality, auxiliary line impact, and error causes. Extensive experiments on 13
leading MLLMs (including thinking models and non-thinking models) yield three
pivotal findings: First, models exhibit substantial performance degradation in
extended reasoning steps (nine models demonstrate over 50% performance drop).
Second, compared to calculation problems, MLLMs tend to take shortcuts when
solving proving problems. Third, models lack auxiliary line awareness, and
enhancing this capability proves particularly beneficial for overall geometry
reasoning improvement. These findings establish GeoLaux as both a benchmark for
evaluating MLLMs' long-step geometric reasoning with auxiliary lines and a
guide for capability advancement. Our dataset and code are included in
supplementary materials and will be released.

Abstract: Unifying probabilistic and logical learning is a key challenge in AI. We
introduce a Bayesian inductive logic programming approach that learns minimum
message length programs from noisy data. Our approach balances hypothesis
complexity and data fit through priors, which explicitly favour more general
programs, and a likelihood that favours accurate programs. Our experiments on
several domains, including game playing and drug design, show that our method
significantly outperforms previous methods, notably those that learn minimum
description length programs. Our results also show that our approach is
data-efficient and insensitive to example balance, including the ability to
learn from exclusively positive examples.

Abstract: The goal of inductive logic programming is to search for a hypothesis that
generalises training data and background knowledge. The challenge is searching
vast hypothesis spaces, which is exacerbated because many logically equivalent
hypotheses exist. To address this challenge, we introduce a method to break
symmetries in the hypothesis space. We implement our idea in answer set
programming. Our experiments on multiple domains, including visual reasoning
and game playing, show that our approach can reduce solving times from over an
hour to just 17 seconds.

introduce primitive-level vulnerability analysis to identify which jailbreaking
techniques are most effective for specific hazard categories. Our collaborative
evaluation with trusted third parties from the AI Safety Network demonstrates
practical pathways for distributed robustness assessment across the community.

### [174] [A "good regulator theorem" for embodied agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06326)
*Nathaniel Virgo,Martin Biehl,Manuel Baltieri,Matteo Capucci*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文重新审视了Conant和Ashby的定理，提出了一种更广义的‘信念更新’模型概念，强调观察者在模型构建中的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Conant和Ashby定理的局限性，并寻找一种更普适的理论框架来解释无显式模型的系统行为。

Method: 通过引入‘信念更新’的概念，将模型视为观察者对外部系统的解释，而非系统本身的固有属性。

Result: 证明了无论系统是调控环境还是内部状态，观察者总能将其解释为具有某种环境模型。

Conclusion: 模型的存在依赖于观察者的视角，解决了显式模型缺失的‘反例’问题。

Abstract: In a classic paper, Conant and Ashby claimed that "every good regulator of a
system must be a model of that system." Artificial Life has produced many
examples of systems that perform tasks with apparently no model in sight; these
suggest Conant and Ashby's theorem doesn't easily generalise beyond its
restricted setup. Nevertheless, here we show that a similar intuition can be
fleshed out in a different way: whenever an agent is able to perform a
regulation task, it is possible for an observer to interpret it as having
"beliefs" about its environment, which it "updates" in response to sensory
input. This notion of belief updating provides a notion of model that is more
sophisticated than Conant and Ashby's, as well as a theorem that is more
broadly applicable. However, it necessitates a change in perspective, in that
the observer plays an essential role in the theory: models are not a mere
property of the system but are imposed on it from outside. Our theorem holds
regardless of whether the system is regulating its environment in a classic
control theory setup, or whether it's regulating its own internal state; the
model is of its environment either way. The model might be trivial, however,
and this is how the apparent counterexamples are resolved.

Motivation: 在线游戏作弊问题严重，现有反作弊系统难以在不侵犯用户隐私的情况下有效应对不断演变的作弊手段。

Method: 使用公开数据集CS2CD（795场比赛数据），生成并增强90,707个上下文窗口，训练Transformer模型。

Result: 模型在未增强测试集上准确率达89.17%，AUC为93.36%。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据驱动的作弊检测提供了可复现且实用的基线，适用于未来研究。

Abstract: Cheating in online video games compromises the integrity of gaming
experiences. Anti-cheat systems, such as VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat), face
significant challenges in keeping pace with evolving cheating methods without
imposing invasive measures on users' systems. This paper presents
AntiCheatPT\_256, a transformer-based machine learning model designed to detect
cheating behaviour in Counter-Strike 2 using gameplay data. To support this, we
introduce and publicly release CS2CD: A labelled dataset of 795 matches. Using
this dataset, 90,707 context windows were created and subsequently augmented to
address class imbalance. The transformer model, trained on these windows,
achieved an accuracy of 89.17\% and an AUC of 93.36\% on an unaugmented test
set. This approach emphasizes reproducibility and real-world applicability,
offering a robust baseline for future research in data-driven cheat detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有XAI方法过于抽象且非自适应，难以满足用户实际理解需求，需转向更人性化的解释方式。

Method: 提出八维概念模型，结合叙事沟通、自适应个性化和渐进披露原则，并通过医疗领域实证验证。

Result: 用户更偏好上下文敏感的多模态解释，而非技术透明度。

Conclusion: 需设计以人类理解为中心的AI解释方法，推动跨领域和文化的研究议程。

Abstract: Current explainable AI (XAI) approaches prioritize algorithmic transparency
and present explanations in abstract, non-adaptive formats that often fail to
support meaningful end-user understanding. This paper introduces "Explanatory
AI" as a complementary paradigm that leverages generative AI capabilities to
serve as explanatory partners for human understanding rather than providers of
algorithmic transparency. While XAI reveals algorithmic decision processes for
model validation, Explanatory AI addresses contextual reasoning to support
human decision-making in sociotechnical contexts. We develop a definition and
systematic eight-dimensional conceptual model distinguishing Explanatory AI
through narrative communication, adaptive personalization, and progressive
disclosure principles. Empirical validation through Rapid Contextual Design
methodology with healthcare professionals demonstrates that users consistently
prefer context-sensitive, multimodal explanations over technical transparency.
Our findings reveal the practical urgency for AI systems designed for human
comprehension rather than algorithmic introspection, establishing a
comprehensive research agenda for advancing user-centered AI explanation
approaches across diverse domains and cultural contexts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出两种构建法律知识图谱的方法，填补法律领域知识图谱的空白，并验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律决策需要全面的立法背景知识和最新案例信息，但法律领域的知识图谱较少，因此开发了针对暴力侵害妇女案件的法律知识图谱。

Method: 采用两种互补方法：系统化的自下而上方法和基于大语言模型的新方法，结合结构化数据提取、本体开发和语义增强。

Result: 构建了针对暴力侵害妇女案件的法律知识图谱，并通过能力问题验证其有效性。

Conclusion: 该知识图谱可提升法律信息的可访问性，支持复杂查询，并为预测性司法机器学习工具提供知识支持。

Abstract: Legal decision-making process requires the availability of comprehensive and
detailed legislative background knowledge and up-to-date information on legal
cases and related sentences/decisions. Legal Knowledge Graphs (KGs) would be a
valuable tool to facilitate access to legal information, to be queried and
exploited for the purpose, and to enable advanced reasoning and machine
learning applications. Indeed, legal KGs may act as knowledge intensive
component to be used by pre-dictive machine learning solutions supporting the
decision process of the legal expert. Nevertheless, a few KGs can be found in
the legal domain. To fill this gap, we developed a legal KG targeting legal
cases of violence against women, along with clear adopted methodologies.
Specifically, the paper introduces two complementary approaches for automated
legal KG construction; a systematic bottom-up approach, customized for the
legal domain, and a new solution leveraging Large Language Models. Starting
from legal sentences publicly available from the European Court of Justice, the
solutions integrate structured data extraction, ontology development, and
semantic enrichment to produce KGs tailored for legal cases involving violence
against women. After analyzing and comparing the results of the two approaches,
the developed KGs are validated via suitable competency questions. The obtained
KG may be impactful for multiple purposes: can improve the accessibility to
legal information both to humans and machine, can enable complex queries and
may constitute an important knowledge component to be possibly exploited by
machine learning tools tailored for predictive justice.

*Debabrota Basu,Udvas Das*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态机制“Fair Game”，通过结合审计员和去偏算法，利用强化学习实现公平性目标的自适应调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平机器学习（Fair ML）的偏置定义多为观察性，且常相互冲突，难以适应动态社会环境。

Method: 提出“Fair Game”框架，将审计员与去偏算法通过强化学习循环结合，动态调整公平性目标。

Result: “Fair Game”能够模拟社会伦理和法律框架的演变，实现部署前后的灵活公平性调整。

Conclusion: “Fair Game”为构建动态适应的公平机器学习系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: An emerging field of AI, namely Fair Machine Learning (ML), aims to quantify
different types of bias (also known as unfairness) exhibited in the predictions
of ML algorithms, and to design new algorithms to mitigate them. Often, the
definitions of bias used in the literature are observational, i.e. they use the
input and output of a pre-trained algorithm to quantify a bias under concern.
In reality,these definitions are often conflicting in nature and can only be
deployed if either the ground truth is known or only in retrospect after
deploying the algorithm. Thus,there is a gap between what we want Fair ML to
achieve and what it does in a dynamic social environment. Hence, we propose an
alternative dynamic mechanism,"Fair Game",to assure fairness in the predictions
of an ML algorithm and to adapt its predictions as the society interacts with
the algorithm over time. "Fair Game" puts together an Auditor and a Debiasing
algorithm in a loop around an ML algorithm. The "Fair Game" puts these two
components in a loop by leveraging Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL algorithms
interact with an environment to take decisions, which yields new observations
(also known as data/feedback) from the environment and in turn, adapts future
decisions. RL is already used in algorithms with pre-fixed long-term fairness
goals. "Fair Game" provides a unique framework where the fairness goals can be
adapted over time by only modifying the auditor and the different biases it
quantifies. Thus,"Fair Game" aims to simulate the evolution of ethical and
legal frameworks in the society by creating an auditor which sends feedback to
a debiasing algorithm deployed around an ML system. This allows us to develop a
flexible and adaptive-over-time framework to build Fair ML systems pre- and
post-deployment.

Result: 神经网络在减少公理违反方面表现优于传统投票规则。

Conclusion: 数据驱动方法可为新投票系统设计提供参考，并推动社会选择领域的数据驱动研究。

Abstract: Committee-selection problems arise in many contexts and applications, and
there has been increasing interest within the social choice research community
on identifying which properties are satisfied by different multi-winner voting
rules. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework to evaluate how
frequently voting rules violate axioms across diverse preference distributions
in practice, shifting away from the binary perspective of axiom satisfaction
given by worst-case analysis. Using this framework, we analyze the relationship
between multi-winner voting rules and their axiomatic performance under several
preference distributions. We then show that neural networks, acting as voting
rules, can outperform traditional rules in minimizing axiom violations. Our
results suggest that data-driven approaches to social choice can inform the
design of new voting systems and support the continuation of data-driven
research in social choice.

TL;DR: 本文研究了Krylov子空间迭代方法（包括GMRES、QMR及其范围限制变体）在解决线性离散不适定问题中的有效性，发现范围限制QMR优于标准QMR，且范围限制GMRES在近似效果上优于传统GMRES。

Motivation: 逆问题在科学和工程中广泛存在，需要稳健的数值方法来解决。本文旨在评估Krylov子空间方法在解决线性离散不适定问题中的表现。

Method: 通过分析GMRES、QMR及其范围限制变体的子空间选择对解质量的影响，比较不同方法的性能。

Result: 范围限制QMR在性能上优于标准QMR，范围限制GMRES在近似效果上优于传统GMRES。范围限制QMR的奇异谱使其对误差更不敏感，特别适用于噪声水平不确定的问题。

Conclusion: 范围限制QMR和GMRES在解决线性离散不适定问题时表现出优越性，尤其是范围限制QMR在噪声不确定的情况下更具优势。

Abstract: Inverse problems arise in various scientific and engineering applications,
necessitating robust numerical methods for their solution. In this work, we
consider the effectiveness of Krylov subspace iterative methods, including
GMRES, QMR, and their range restricted variants for solving linear discrete
ill-posed problems. We analyze the impact of subspace selection on solution
quality. Our findings indicate that range restricted QMR can outperform
standard QMR, and confirm the previously observed behavior that range
restricted GMRES can be superior to conventional GMRES in terms of
approximation efficacy. Notably, range restricted QMR demonstrates a key
advantage over GMRES with respect to range restricted QMR's singular spectrum
which can make the method less sensitive to errors that are naturally present
making it particularly effective when the noise level in the problem is
uncertain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 矩形多参数特征值问题（RMEP）由于系数矩阵为矩形（通常行多于列），可能无解，因此需要一种近似求解方法。

Method: 提出了最小扰动框架，针对单个近似特征元组设计了交替迭代算法，针对完整集合则转化为标准MEP求解。

Result: 方法在离散化的多参数Sturm-Liouville方程和Helmholtz方程上验证有效。

Conclusion: 最小扰动框架为RMEP提供了一种可行的近似求解途径。

Abstract: The rectangular multiparameter eigenvalue problem (RMEP) involves rectangular
coefficient matrices (usually with more rows than columns) and may potentially
have no solution in its original form. A minimal perturbation framework is
proposed to defines approximate solutions. Computationally, two particular
scenarios are considered: computing one approximate eigen-tuple or a complete
set of approximate eigen-tuples. For computing one approximate eigen-tuple, an
alternating iterative scheme with proven convergence is devised, while for a
complete set of approximate eigen-tuples, the framework leads to a standard MEP
(RMEP with square coefficient matrices) for numerical solutions. The proposed
approach is validated on RMEPs from discretizing the multiparameter
Sturm-Liouville equation and the Helmholtz equations by the least-squares
spectral method.

Conclusion: HTLR矩阵是一种高效且通用的近似方法，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: In this paper, a hierarchical Tucker low-rank (HTLR) matrix is proposed to
approximate non-oscillatory kernel functions in linear complexity. The HTLR
matrix is based on the hierarchical matrix, with the low-rank blocks replaced
by Tucker low-rank blocks. Using high-dimensional interpolation as well as
tensor contractions, algorithms for the construction and matrix-vector
multiplication of HTLR matrices are proposed admitting linear and quasi-linear
complexities respectively. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the HTLR
matrix performs well in both memory and runtime. Furthermore, the HTLR matrix
can also be applied on quasi-uniform grids in addition to uniform grids,

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高性能的同时，通过限制局部细化灵活性，实现了大规模并行计算的高效误差估计。

Abstract: This work introduces an adaptive mesh refinement technique for hierarchical
hybrid grids with the goal to reach scalability and maintain excellent
performance on massively parallel computer systems. On the block structured
hierarchical hybrid grids, this is accomplished by using classical,
unstructured refinement only on the coarsest level of the hierarchy, while
keeping the number of structured refinement levels constant on the whole
domain. This leads to a compromise where the excellent performance
characteristics of hierarchical hybrid grids can be maintained at the price
that the flexibility of generating locally refined meshes is constrained.
Furthermore, mesh adaptivity often relies on a posteriori error estimators or
error indicators that tend to become computationally expensive. Again with the
goal of preserving scalability and performance, a method is proposed that
leverages the grid hierarchy and the full multigrid scheme that generates a
natural sequence of approximations on the nested hierarchy of grids. This
permits to compute a cheap error estimator that is well-suited for large-scale
parallel computing. We present the theoretical foundations for both global and
local error estimates and present a rigorous analysis of their effectivity. The
proposed method, including error estimator and the adaptive coarse grid
refinement, is implemented in the finite element framework HyTeG. Extensive
numerical experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness, as well as
performance and scalability.

Conclusion: 为理解维度稳定性及构建样条空间基函数奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of dimensional stability for spline spaces
over T-meshes, providing the first mathematical definition and a preliminary
classification framework. We define dimensional stability as an invariant
within the structurally isomorphic class, contingent on the rank stability of
the conformality matrix. Absolute stability is proposed via structurally
similar maps to address topological and order structures. Through the
$k$-partition decomposition of T-connected components and analysis of the CNDC,
we establish a correspondence between conformality vector spaces and rank
stability. For diagonalizable T-meshes, decomposition into independent
one-dimensional T $l$-edges facilitates basis function construction, while
arbitrary T-meshes are partitioned into one- and two-dimensional components.
These findings lay the groundwork for understanding dimensional stability and
developing spline space basis functions.

Abstract: In this paper we establish best approximation type error estimates for the
fully discrete Galerkin solutions of the time-dependent Stokes problem using
the stream-function formulation. For the time discretization we use the
discontinuous Galerkin method of arbitrary degree, whereas we present the space
discretization in a general framework. This makes our result applicable for a
wide variety of space discretization methods, provided some Galerkin
orthogonality conditions are satisfied. As an example, conformal $C^1$ and
$C^0$ interior penalty methods are covered by our analysis. The results do not
require any additional regularity assumptions beyond the natural regularity
given by the domain and data and can be used for optimal control problems.

Abstract: Weighted model counting computes the sum of the rational-valued weights
associated with the satisfying assignments for a Boolean formula, where the
weight of an assignment is given by the product of the weights assigned to the
positive and negated variables comprising the assignment. Weighted model
counting finds applications across a variety of domains including probabilistic
reasoning and quantitative risk assessment.
  Most weighted model counting programs operate by (explicitly or implicitly)
converting the input formula into a form that enables arithmetic evaluation,
using multiplication for conjunctions and addition for disjunctions. Performing
this evaluation using floating-point arithmetic can yield inaccurate results,
and it cannot quantify the level of precision achieved. Computing with rational
arithmetic gives exact results, but it is costly in both time and space.
  This paper describes how to combine multiple numeric representations to
efficiently compute weighted model counts that are guaranteed to achieve a
user-specified precision. When all weights are nonnegative, we prove that the
precision loss of arithmetic evaluation using floating-point arithmetic can be
tightly bounded. We show that supplementing a standard IEEE double-precision
representation with a separate 64-bit exponent, a format we call extended-range
double (ERD), avoids the underflow and overflow issues commonly encountered in
weighted model counting. For problems with mixed negative and positive weights,
we show that a combination of interval floating-point arithmetic and rational
arithmetic can achieve the twin goals of efficiency and guaranteed precision.
For our evaluations, we have devised especially challenging formulas and weight
assignments, demonstrating the robustness of our approach.

Abstract: The Active Flux method is a finite volume method for hyperbolic conservation
laws that uses both cell averages and point values as degrees of freedom.
Several versions of such methods are currently under development. We focus on
third order accurate, fully discrete Active Flux methods with compact stencil
in space and time. These methods require exact or approximate evolution
operators for the update of the point value degrees of freedom which are
provided by the method of bicharacteristics. Here we propose new limiting
strategies that guarantee positivity of pressure and density and furthermore
discuss the implementation of reflecting boundary conditions. Numerical results
show that the method leads to accurate approximates on coarse grids.

in hyper-time. Here, we propose a Fourier series expansion-based shooting
method (FSE-Shooting) for the parallelized computation of quasi-periodic
solution with $d$ base frequencies ($d \ge 2$). We represent the associated
$d$-torus as a collection of trajectories initialized at a ($d-1$)-torus. We
drive a set of ODEs that hold for any of these trajectories. We also derive a
set of boundary conditions that couple the initial and terminal states of these
trajectories and then formulate a set of nonlinear algebraic equations via the
coupling conditions. We use Fourier series expansion to parameterize the
($d-1$)-torus and shooting method to iterate the Fourier coefficients
associated with initial torus such that the coupling conditions are satisfied.
In particular, the terminal points of these trajectories are parallelized
computed via Newmark integration, where the time points and Fourier
coefficients are transformed to each other by alternating Frequency-Time
method. A straightforward phase condition is devised to track the
quasi-periodic solutions with priori unknown base frequencies. Additionally,
the by-product of the FSE-Shooting can be also directly used to compute the
Lyapunov exponents to assess the stabilities of quasi-periodic solutions. The
results of three finite element systems show the efficiency and versatility of
FSE-Shooting in high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems, including a
three-dimensional shell structure with $1872$ DOFs.

Abstract: Computing with discrete representations of high-dimensional probability
distributions is fundamental to uncertainty quantification, Bayesian inference,
and stochastic modeling. However, storing and manipulating such distributions
suffers from the curse of dimensionality, as memory and computational costs
grow exponentially with dimension. Monte Carlo methods require thousands to
billions of samples, incurring high computational costs and producing
inconsistent results due to stochasticity. We present an efficient tensor train
method for performing exact arithmetic operations on discretizations of
continuous probability distributions while avoiding exponential growth. Our
approach leverages low-rank tensor train decomposition to represent latent
random variables compactly using Dirac deltas, enabling deterministic addition,
subtraction and multiplication operations directly in the compressed format. We
develop an efficient implementation using sparse matrices and specialized data
structures that further enhances performance. Theoretical analysis demonstrates
polynomial scaling of memory and computational complexity under rank
assumptions, and shows how statistics of latent variables can be computed with
polynomial complexity. Numerical experiments spanning randomized linear algebra
to stochastic differential equations demonstrate orders-of-magnitude
improvements in memory usage and computational time compared to conventional
approaches, enabling tractable deterministic computations on discretized random
variables in previously intractable dimensions.

Abstract: Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a recent imaging modality where
superparamagnetic nanoparticles are employed as tracers. The reconstruction
task is to obtain the spatial particle distribution from a voltage signal
induced by the particles. Generally, in computational imaging variational
reconstruction techniques are common and rely on a mathematical model to
describe the underlying physics. For the MPI reconstruction task we propose a
model-based variational reconstruction technique which incorporates a higher
order regularizer, where the regularizer is diagonalized by harmonic
eigenfunctions. The proposed image reconstruction algorithm features two major
stages: in the first stage, the core stage, the components of the MPI core
response are reconstructed. This is the MPI-specific data approximation task
which we formulate as a variational problem incorporating the higher order
regularizer. The relationship between the particle distribution, the MPI core
response and the measured data is given by a mathematical model which was
introduced in our earlier research. According to this model the MPI core
response is tied to the particle distribution by convolution. Therefore the
outcome of the core stage yields the data for the second stage, the
deconvolution stage, in which the final reconstructed image is produced by
solving an ill-posed deconvolution problem in a robust way relying on earlier
research. Interestingly, the quality of the final image depends significantly
on the quality of the result of the core stage. A contribution is thus the
enhancement of the core stage via higher order regularization. We provide a
theoretical foundation for our approach and demonstrate its benefit with
numerical examples.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a rigorous framework for rational minimax
approximation of matrix-valued functions that generalizes classical scalar
approximation theory. Given sampled data $\{(x_\ell, {F}(x_\ell))\}_{\ell=1}^m$
where ${F}:\mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}^{s \times t}$ is a matrix-valued function,
we study the problem of finding a matrix-valued rational approximant ${R}(x) =
{P}(x)/q(x)$ (with ${P}:\mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}^{s \times t}$ a matrix-valued
polynomial and $q(x)$ a nonzero scalar polynomial of prescribed degrees) that
minimizes the worst-case Frobenius norm error over the given nodes: $$
\inf_{{R}(x) = {P}(x)/q(x)} \max_{1 \leq \ell \leq m} \|{F}(x_\ell) -
{R}(x_\ell)\|_{\rm F}. $$ By reformulating this min-max optimization problem
through Lagrangian duality, we derive a maximization dual problem over the
probability simplex. We analyze weak and strong duality properties and
establish a sufficient condition ensuring that the solution of the dual problem
yields the minimax approximant $R(x)$. For numerical implementation, we propose
an efficient method (\textsf{m-d-Lawson}) to solve the dual problem,
generalizing Lawson's iteration to matrix-valued functions. Numerical
experiments are conducted and compared to state-of-the-art approaches,
demonstrating its efficiency as a novel computational framework for
matrix-valued rational approximation.

Result: 研究发现TCR的存在加速了收敛，且收敛速度与网格无关；异质对比度和热导率也有助于收敛。

Conclusion: 数值实验验证了理论发现，表明该方法适用于非线性问题和不规则域。

Abstract: Heat transfer in composites is critical in engineering, where imperfect layer
contact causes thermal contact resistance (TCR), leading to interfacial
temperature discontinuity. We propose solving this numerically using the
optimized Schwarz method (OSM), which decouples the heterogeneous problem into
homogeneous subproblems. This avoids ill-conditioned systems from monolithic
solving due to high contrast and interface jumps. Both energy estimate and
Fourier analysis are used to prove the convergence of this algorithm when the
standard Robin condition is applied to transmit information between subdomains.
To achieve fast convergence, instead of the standard Robin, the scaled Robin
transmission condition is proposed, and the involved free parameter is
rigorously optimized. The results reveal several new findings due to the
presence of TCR: first, the larger the TCR, the faster the OSM converges;
second, mesh-independent convergence is achieved in the asymptotic sense, in
contrast to the mesh-dependent results without TCR; and last, the heterogeneity
contrast benefits the convergence, with a larger contrast leading to faster
convergence. Interestingly, different from the case without TCR, the thermal
conductivity also benefits the convergence, similar to the effect of
heterogeneity. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical findings and
demonstrate the method's potential for nonlinear problems on irregular domains.

Abstract: Sticky diffusion models a Markovian particle experiencing reflection and
temporary adhesion phenomena at the boundary. Numerous numerical schemes exist
for approximating stopped or reflected stochastic differential equations
(SDEs), but this is not the case for sticky SDEs. In this paper, we construct
and analyze half-order and first-order numerical schemes for the weak
approximation of stochastic differential equations with sticky boundary
conditions. We present the algorithms in general setting such that they can be
used to solve general linear parabolic partial differential equations with
second-order sticky boundary condition via the probabilistic representations of
their solutions. Since the sticky diffusion spends non-zero amount of time on
boundary, it poses extra challenge in designing the schemes and obtaining their
order of convergence. We support the theoretical results with numerical
experiments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将因果循环图（CLD）转化为探索性系统动力学模型（SDM）的方法（D2D），以弥补CLD在动态分析和干预策略支持上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLD作为静态定性工具，无法支持动态分析且易导致错误推断，因此需要一种方法将其转化为动态模型。

Method: D2D方法通过用户简单标注变量类型（存量、流量/辅助变量或常量），利用CLD中的结构信息（链接存在性和极性）进行模拟和干预分析。

Result: D2D能区分高/低优先级杠杆点，与数据驱动模型一致性优于网络中心性分析，并提供不确定性估计和数据收集指导。

Conclusion: D2D方法通过开源工具实现，有望在广泛领域验证其有效性，降低动态建模门槛。

Abstract: Causal loop diagrams (CLDs) are widely used in health and environmental
research to represent hypothesized causal structures underlying complex
problems. However, as qualitative and static representations, CLDs are limited
in their ability to support dynamic analysis and inform intervention
strategies. Additionally, quantitative CLD analysis methods like network
centrality analysis often lead to false inference. We propose
Diagrams-to-Dynamics (D2D), a method for converting CLDs into exploratory
system dynamics models (SDMs) in the absence of empirical data. With minimal
user input - following a protocol to label variables as stocks,
flows/auxiliaries, or constants - D2D leverages the structural information
already encoded in CLDs, namely, link existence and polarity, to simulate
hypothetical interventions and explore potential leverage points under
uncertainty. Results suggest that D2D helps distinguish between high- and
low-ranked leverage points. We compare D2D to a data-driven SDM constructed
from the same CLD and variable labeling. D2D showed greater consistency with
the data-driven model than network centrality analysis, while providing
uncertainty estimates and guidance for future data collection. The method is
implemented in an open-source Python package and a web-based application to
support further testing and lower the barrier to dynamic modeling for
researchers working with CLDs. We expect additional validation will further
establish the approach's utility across a broad range of cases and domains.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅能重新发现已知物理结构，还能生成跨领域关系假设，为理论研究提供新方向。

Abstract: This work introduces a novel framework for representing and analyzing
physical laws as a weighted knowledge graph. We constructed a database of 659
distinct physical equations, subjected to rigorous semantic cleaning to resolve
notational ambiguities, resulting in a corpus of 400 advanced physics
equations. We developed an enhanced graph representation where both physical
concepts and equations are nodes, connected by weighted inter-equation bridges.
These weights are objectively defined using normalized metrics for variable
overlap, physics-informed importance scores, and bibliometric data. A Graph
Attention Network (GAT) was trained for link prediction, achieving a test AUC
of 0.9742 +/- 0.0018 across five independent runs, significantly outperforming
both classical heuristics (best baseline AUC: 0.9487) and established GNN
architectures like GraphSAGE (AUC: 0.9504, p = 0.029). Statistical testing
confirmed significance of all comparisons (p < 0.05), with 2.7% improvement
over the best baseline. Our analysis reveals three key findings: (i) The model
autonomously rediscovers the known macroscopic structure of physics,
identifying strong conceptual axes between Electromagnetism and Statistical
Mechanics. (ii) It identifies central hub equations that serve as critical
bridges between multiple physical domains. (iii) The model generates stable,
computationally-derived hypotheses for cross-domain relationships, identifying
both known principles and suggesting novel mathematical analogies for further
theoretical investigation. The framework can generate hundreds of such
hypotheses, enabling the creation of specialized datasets for targeted analysis
of specific physics subfields. Code and data available at

Result: 在Lorenz 96模型、Kuramoto--Sivashinsky方程和Kolmogorov流等混沌系统中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 神经网络nudging方法为非线性系统中的数据同化提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Nudging is an empirical data assimilation technique that incorporates an
observation-driven control term into the model dynamics. The trajectory of the
nudged system approaches the true system trajectory over time, even when the
initial conditions differ. For linear state space models, such control terms
can be derived under mild assumptions. However, designing effective nudging
terms becomes significantly more challenging in the nonlinear setting. In this
work, we propose neural network nudging, a data-driven method for learning
nudging terms in nonlinear state space models. We establish a theoretical
existence result based on the Kazantzis--Kravaris--Luenberger observer theory.
The proposed approach is evaluated on three benchmark problems that exhibit
chaotic behavior: the Lorenz 96 model, the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation, and
the Kolmogorov flow.

Abstract: Accurate distribution grid topology is essential for reliable modern grid
operations. However, real-world utility data originates from multiple sources
with varying characteristics and levels of quality. In this work, developed in
collaboration with Oncor Electric Delivery, we propose a scalable framework
that reconstructs a trustworthy grid topology by systematically integrating
heterogeneous data. We observe that distribution topology is fundamentally
governed by two complementary dimensions: the spatial layout of physical
infrastructure (e.g., GIS and asset metadata) and the dynamic behavior of the
system in the signal domain (e.g., voltage time series). When jointly
leveraged, these dimensions support a complete and physically coherent
reconstruction of network connectivity. To address the challenge of uneven data
quality without compromising observability, we introduce a confidence-aware
inference mechanism that preserves structurally informative yet imperfect
inputs, while quantifying the reliability of each inferred connection for
operator interpretation. This soft handling of uncertainty is tightly coupled
with hard enforcement of physical feasibility: we embed operational
constraints, such as transformer capacity limits and radial topology
requirements, directly into the learning process. Together, these components
ensure that inference is both uncertainty-aware and structurally valid,
enabling rapid convergence to actionable, trustworthy topologies under
real-world deployment conditions. The proposed framework is validated using
data from over 8000 meters across 3 feeders in Oncor's service territory,
demonstrating over 95% accuracy in topology reconstruction and substantial
improvements in confidence calibration and computational efficiency relative to
baseline methods.

Abstract: Across scientific domains, a fundamental challenge is to characterize and
compute the mappings from underlying physical processes to observed signals and
measurements. While nonlinear neural networks have achieved considerable
success, they remain theoretically opaque, which hinders adoption in contexts
where interpretability is paramount. In contrast, linear neural networks serve
as a simple yet effective foundation for gaining insight into these complex
relationships. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical framework for
analyzing linear encoder-decoder architectures through the lens of Bayes risk
minimization for solving data-driven scientific machine learning problems. We
derive closed-form, rank-constrained linear and affine linear optimal mappings
for forward modeling and inverse recovery tasks. Our results generalize
existing formulations by accommodating rank-deficiencies in data, forward
operators, and measurement processes. We validate our theoretical results by
conducting numerical experiments on datasets from simple biomedical imaging,
financial factor analysis, and simulations involving nonlinear fluid dynamics
via the shallow water equations. This work provides a robust baseline for
understanding and benchmarking learned neural network models for scientific
machine learning problems.

Abstract: In the domain of scientific machine learning, designing effective reward
functions remains a challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in
environments where task goals are difficult to specify numerically. Reward
functions in existing work are predominantly based on heuristics, manual
engineering, or task-specific tuning. In this work, we introduce a semantically
aligned reinforcement learning method where rewards are computed by aligning
the current state with a target semantic instruction using a
Sentence-Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (SBERT).
Instead of relying on manually defined reward functions, the policy receives
feedback based on the reward, which is a cosine similarity between the goal
textual description and the statement description in the episode. We evaluated
our approach in several environments and showed that semantic reward can guide
learning to achieve competitive control behavior, even in the absence of
hand-crafted reward functions. Our study demonstrates a correlation between the
language embedding space and the conventional Euclidean space. This framework
opens new horizons for aligning agent behavior with natural language goals and
lays the groundwork for a more seamless integration of larger language models
(LLMs) and fluid control applications.

Conclusion: 该框架为动态TAGs中的节点分类提供了可扩展且鲁棒的解决方案，为知识系统和科学发现开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Textual Attribute Graphs (TAGs) are critical for modeling complex networks
like citation networks, but effective node classification remains challenging
due to difficulties in integrating rich semantics from text with structural
graph information. Existing methods often struggle with capturing nuanced
domain-specific terminology, modeling long-range dependencies, adapting to
temporal evolution, and scaling to massive datasets. To address these issues,
we propose a novel framework that integrates TAPE (Text-Attributed Graph
Representation Enhancement) with Graphormer. Our approach leverages a large
language model (LLM), specifically ChatGPT, within the TAPE framework to
generate semantically rich explanations from paper content, which are then
fused into enhanced node representations. These embeddings are combined with
structural features using a novel integration layer with learned attention
weights. Graphormer's path-aware position encoding and multi-head attention
mechanisms are employed to effectively capture long-range dependencies across
the citation network. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on the
challenging ogbn-arxiv dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a
classification accuracy of 0.772, significantly surpassing the best GCN
baseline of 0.713. Our method also yields strong results in precision (0.671),
recall (0.577), and F1-score (0.610). We validate our approach through
comprehensive ablation studies that quantify the contribution of each
component, demonstrating the synergy between semantic and structural
information. Our framework provides a scalable and robust solution for node
classification in dynamic TAGs, offering a promising direction for future
research in knowledge systems and scientific discovery.

Motivation: 传统避碰策略通常在接近碰撞时间（TCA）前24小时启动，可能导致燃料浪费。本研究旨在通过早期决策优化燃料消耗和碰撞风险。

Method: 将避碰建模为连续状态、离散动作和有限时间范围的MDP，结合分析模型评估碰撞风险、燃料消耗和轨道几何。使用RL-PG算法训练策略。

Conclusion: 该方法在优化燃料消耗和碰撞风险方面优于传统策略，验证了MDP和RL-PG在自主避碰中的有效性。

Abstract: This work presents a Markov decision process (MDP) framework to model
decision-making for collision avoidance maneuver (CAM) and a reinforcement
learning policy gradient (RL-PG) algorithm to train an autonomous guidance
policy using historic CAM data. In addition to maintaining acceptable collision
risks, this approach seeks to minimize the average fuel consumption of CAMs by
making early maneuver decisions. We model CAM as a continuous state, discrete
action and finite horizon MDP, where the critical decision is determining when
to initiate the maneuver. The MDP model also incorporates analytical models for
conjunction risk, propellant consumption, and transit orbit geometry. The
Markov policy effectively trades-off maneuver delay-which improves the
reliability of conjunction risk indicators-with propellant consumption-which
increases with decreasing maneuver time. Using historical data of tracked
conjunction events, we verify this framework and conduct an extensive ablation
study on the hyper-parameters used within the MDP. On synthetic conjunction
events, the trained policy significantly minimizes both the overall and average
propellant consumption per CAM when compared to a conventional cut-off policy
that initiates maneuvers 24 hours before the time of closest approach (TCA). On
historical conjunction events, the trained policy consumes more propellant
overall but reduces the average propellant consumption per CAM. For both
historical and synthetic conjunction events, the trained policy achieves equal
if not higher overall collision risk guarantees.

Abstract: The research paper addresses decomposition of a stochastic time series into
three time series representing a dual signal i.e., the mean and the dispersion,
with noise isolated. Decomposition is done by applying machine learning to fit
a dual signal. Machine learning minimizes the loss function which compromises
between fitting the original time series and penalizing irregularities of the
dual signal. The latter includes terms based on the first and second order
derivatives along time. To preserve special patterns, weighting of the
regularization components of the loss function has been introduced based on
Statistical Process Control methodology. The proposed decomposition can be
applied as a smoothing algorithm against the mean and dispersion of the time
series. By isolating noise, the proposed decomposition can be seen as a
denoising algorithm. Two approaches of the learning process have been
considered: sequential and jointly. The former approach learns the mean signal
first and then dispersion. The latter approach fits the dual signal jointly.
Jointly learning can uncover complex relationships for the time series with
heteroskedasticity. Learning has been set by solving the direct non-linear
unconstrained optimization problem or by applying neural networks that have
sequential or twin output architectures. Tuning of the loss function
hyperparameters focuses on the isolated noise to be a stationary stochastic
process without autocorrelation properties. Depending on the applications, the
hyperparameters of the learning can be tuned towards either the discrete states
by stepped signal or smoothed series. The decomposed dual signal can be
represented on the 2D space and used to learn inherent structures, to forecast
both mean and dispersion, or to analyze cross effects in case of multiple time
series.

Motivation: 神经PDE求解器的精度问题通常源于优化困难而非表达能力不足，尤其是在多保真度和刚性问题上。本文旨在解决这一优化瓶颈。

Method: 提出Shifted Gaussian Encoding方法，通过过滤激活矩阵提高其秩和表达能力，同时保持凸性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，条件数而非网络深度是科学神经求解器的瓶颈，简单的架构改进可带来显著性能提升。

Abstract: Accuracy in neural PDE solvers often breaks down not because of limited
expressivity, but due to poor optimisation caused by ill-conditioning,
especially in multi-fidelity and stiff problems. We study this issue in
Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machines (PIELMs), a convex variant of neural
PDE solvers, and show that asymptotic components in governing equations can
produce highly ill-conditioned activation matrices, severely limiting
convergence. We introduce Shifted Gaussian Encoding, a simple yet effective
activation filtering step that increases matrix rank and expressivity while
preserving convexity. Our method extends the solvable range of Peclet numbers
in steady advection-diffusion equations by over two orders of magnitude,
achieves up to six orders lower error on multi-frequency function learning, and
fits high-fidelity image vectors more accurately and faster than deep networks
with over a million parameters. This work highlights that conditioning, not
depth, is often the bottleneck in scientific neural solvers and that simple
architectural changes can unlock substantial gains.

Motivation: GRPO在训练大型推理模型时存在Think-Answer Mismatch问题，噪声奖励信号会破坏学习过程，尤其是在不平衡的响应组中。

Method: 提出S-GRPO，通过优化噪声感知的优势权重来稳定训练。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，S-GRPO显著优于GRPO，性能提升达2.2%-2.5%，并在20%合成噪声下保持稳定学习。

Conclusion: S-GRPO为大规模推理模型的训练提供了更稳健和有效的方法。

Abstract: Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a key technique for training
large reasoning models, yet it suffers from a critical vulnerability: the
\emph{Think-Answer Mismatch}, where noisy reward signals corrupt the learning
process. This problem is most severe in unbalanced response groups,
paradoxically degrading the signal precisely when it should be most
informative. To address this challenge, we propose Stable Group-Relative Policy
Optimization (S-GRPO), a principled enhancement that derives optimal,
noise-aware advantage weights to stabilize training. Our comprehensive
experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate S-GRPO's
effectiveness and robustness. On various models, S-GRPO significantly
outperforms DR. GRPO, achieving performance gains of +2.5% on
Qwen-Math-7B-Base, +2.2% on Llama-3.2-3B-Base, and +2.4% on
Qwen-Math-1.5B-Instruct. Most critically, while standard GRPO fails to learn
under 20% synthetic reward noise, S-GRPO maintains stable learning progress.
These results highlight S-GRPO's potential for more robust and effective
training of large-scale reasoning models. \footnote{Code and data are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统剪枝方法（如CCP和REP）基于贪心策略，可能导致泛化能力不足，尤其是在小规模复杂数据集上。

Method: 将剪枝过程建模为探索-利用问题，利用MAB算法动态选择最优分支节点进行剪枝。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个基准数据集上优于传统剪枝方法，预测性能更优。

Conclusion: MAB剪枝方法为决策树优化提供了一种动态且概率化的新思路。

Abstract: Decision trees, without appropriate constraints, can easily become overly
complex and prone to overfit, capturing noise rather than generalizable
patterns. To resolve this problem,pruning operation is a crucial part in
optimizing decision trees, as it not only reduces the complexity of trees but
also decreases the probability of generating overfit models. The conventional
pruning techniques like Cost-Complexity Pruning (CCP) and Reduced Error Pruning
(REP) are mostly based on greedy approaches that focus on immediate gains in
performance while pruning nodes of the decision tree. However, this might
result in a lower generalization in the long run, compromising the robust
ability of the tree model when introduced to unseen data samples, particularly
when trained with small and complex datasets. To address this challenge, we are
proposing a Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB)-based pruning approach, a reinforcement
learning (RL)-based technique, that will dynamically prune the tree to generate
an optimal decision tree with better generalization. Our proposed approach
assumes the pruning process as an exploration-exploitation problem, where we
are utilizing the MAB algorithms to find optimal branch nodes to prune based on
feedback from each pruning actions. Experimental evaluation on several
benchmark datasets, demonstrated that our proposed approach results in better
predictive performance compared to the traditional ones. This suggests the
potential of utilizing MAB for a dynamic and probabilistic way of decision tree
pruning, in turn optimizing the decision tree-based model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习中，学习策略与行为策略之间的分布偏移会导致OOD动作和高估问题，需要一种既能防止高估又能提升性能的方法。

Method: 提出MCRE框架，结合TD误差和行为克隆项，开发MCRQ算法，集成到离线策略actor-critic框架中。

Result: 实验表明，MCRQ在基准数据集上优于现有基线方法和最先进的离线RL算法。

Conclusion: MCRE和MCRQ有效平衡了保守性和性能，提升了离线强化学习的表现。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to learn optimal policies from
static datasets without further environment interaction. A key challenge is the
distribution shift between the learned and behavior policies, leading to
out-of-distribution (OOD) actions and overestimation. To prevent gross
overestimation, the value function must remain conservative; however, excessive
conservatism may hinder performance improvement. To address this, we propose
the mildly conservative regularized evaluation (MCRE) framework, which balances
conservatism and performance by combining temporal difference (TD) error with a
behavior cloning term in the Bellman backup. Building on this, we develop the
mildly conservative regularized Q-learning (MCRQ) algorithm, which integrates
MCRE into an off-policy actor-critic framework. Experiments show that MCRQ
outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms on
benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种方法，通过重新定义误差为非线性扰动的线性递归，并结合半范数的收缩性与诱导范数的单调性，首次实现了参数无关的$\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{t})$最优收敛速率，适用于平均奖励和指数折扣的$Q$-学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非线性固定点方程（如平均奖励$Q$-学习和TD学习）中半范数收缩导致的参数无关最优收敛速率难以实现的问题。

Method: 将平均误差重新定义为非线性扰动的线性递归，并通过半范数收缩与诱导范数单调性的耦合来抑制非线性。

Result: 首次实现了参数无关的$\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{t})$最优收敛速率，适用于多种场景（同步/异步、单智能体/分布式、模拟器/马尔可夫轨迹数据）。

Conclusion: 该方法为非线性固定点方程的求解提供了更高效的收敛速率，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Algorithms for solving \textit{nonlinear} fixed-point equations -- such as
average-reward \textit{$Q$-learning} and \textit{TD-learning} -- often involve
semi-norm contractions. Achieving parameter-free optimal convergence rates for
these methods via Polyak--Ruppert averaging has remained elusive, largely due
to the non-monotonicity of such semi-norms. We close this gap by (i.) recasting
the averaged error as a linear recursion involving a nonlinear perturbation,
and (ii.) taming the nonlinearity by coupling the semi-norm's contraction with
the monotonicity of a suitably induced norm. Our main result yields the first
parameter-free $\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{t})$ optimal rates for $Q$-learning in both
average-reward and exponentially discounted settings, where $t$ denotes the
iteration index. The result applies within a broad framework that accommodates
synchronous and asynchronous updates, single-agent and distributed deployments,
and data streams obtained either from simulators or along Markovian
trajectories.

Motivation: 解决长推理链带来的训练成本高、推理延迟大和部署困难的问题。

Result: 在多个代码生成基准测试中达到最优准确率，LiveCodeBench v4_v5上减少23.5%的token生成和43.5%的推理延迟。

Conclusion: ASAP为构建高效强大的LRMs提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Recently, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in code reasoning by scaling up the length of Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, excessively long reasoning traces introduce substantial
challenges in terms of training cost, inference latency, and deployment
feasibility. While various CoT compression approaches have emerged to address
this challenge, they face inherent trade-offs: token-level methods often
disrupt syntactic and logical coherence, while step-level methods based on
perplexity fail to reliably capture the logically critical reasoning steps. In
this paper, we propose ASAP (Anchor-guided, Surprisal-based Pruning), a novel
coarse-to-fine framework for CoT compression. ASAP first performs anchor-guided
pruning to preserve the core reasoning structure, which efficiently reduces the
search space for subsequent processing. It then enables a logic-aware pruning
by selecting logically essential reasoning steps based on a novel first-token
surprisal metric. Finally, ASAP teaches models to autonomously generate and
leverage these concise CoTs at inference time, enabling efficient reasoning in
coding tasks. Experiments show that ASAP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
across multiple code generation benchmarks while substantially reducing
training and inference costs. On the challenging LiveCodeBench v4_v5 benchmark,
our approach reduces token generation by 23.5% and inference latency by 43.5%
compared to the strongest baseline, while achieving a competitive accuracy of
36.19% in Pass@1. Our results highlight a promising direction for building
powerful and efficient LRMs.

Conclusion: 结合符号规划和LLMs的MCTS-OPS框架在复杂领域展示了高质量代码生成的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
code generation and structured reasoning; however, their performance often
degrades on complex tasks that require consistent multi-step planning. Recent
work has explored combining LLMs with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), yet
existing approaches primarily focus on generating heuristic-based code for
optimization or target simpler tasks where correctness alone is sufficient. In
this work, we propose MCTS-OPS, a novel neural-symbolic framework that
formulates prompt selection as a sequential decision process guided by MCTS.
Our method explores and refines multi-step prompt sequences for the goal of
improving code generation quality and enhancing the problem-solving
capabilities of LLMs in general optimization. Experiments on network
optimization show significant improvement over the baselines, both in the
success rate of executing the generated code and in the optimization results
with the specified objective and constraints (2$\sim$4$\times$ higher reward
and 3$\times$ lower standard deviation). Moreover, it improves the chance of
attaining the optimal solution by about 10\% of cases, compared to baseline
methods in hard problems. These results highlight the promise of combining
symbolic planning with LLMs for robust, high-quality code generation in complex
domains.

Motivation: 心脏骤停后昏迷患者的预后预测对ICU临床决策至关重要，但目前的信息收集方式（分阶段）未被充分利用。

Method: 扩展了Fine和Gray模型，明确建模两个阶段（时间不变和时间变化特征），并引入神经网络捕捉非线性关系。

Conclusion: 该模型可推广到更多阶段，适用于其他动态预测任务，帮助确定新收集特征何时对预测有显著改进。

Abstract: Prognostication for comatose post-cardiac arrest patients is a critical
challenge that directly impacts clinical decision-making in the ICU. Clinical
information that informs prognostication is collected serially over time.
Shortly after cardiac arrest, various time-invariant baseline features are
collected (e.g., demographics, cardiac arrest characteristics). After ICU
admission, additional features are gathered, including time-varying hemodynamic
data (e.g., blood pressure, doses of vasopressor medications). We view these as
two phases in which we collect new features. In this study, we propose a novel
stepwise dynamic competing risks model that improves the prediction of
neurological outcomes by automatically determining when to take advantage of
time-invariant features (first phase) and time-varying features (second phase).
Notably, our model finds patients for whom this second phase (time-varying
hemodynamic) information is beneficial for prognostication and also when this
information is beneficial (as we collect more hemodynamic data for a patient
over time, how important these data are for prognostication varies). Our
approach extends the standard Fine and Gray model to explicitly model the two
phases and to incorporate neural networks to flexibly capture complex nonlinear
feature relationships. Evaluated on a retrospective cohort of 2,278 comatose
post-arrest patients, our model demonstrates robust discriminative performance
for the competing outcomes of awakening, withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy,
and death despite maximal support. Our approach generalizes to more than two
phases in which new features are collected and could be used in other dynamic
prediction tasks, where it may be helpful to know when and for whom newly
collected features significantly improve prediction.

Motivation: 现有研究多孤立处理异质性或异质性，忽视了实际应用中异质性异构图（heterophilic HGs）的普遍性，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出AHGNN，采用异质性感知卷积处理跳数和元路径的异质性分布，并通过粗到细的注意力机制整合不同语义空间的信息。

Result: 在七个真实世界图和二十个基线上的实验表明，AHGNN在高异质性情况下表现优异。

Conclusion: AHGNN有效解决了异质性分布和语义多样性问题，为异构图建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Heterogeneous graphs (HGs) are common in real-world scenarios and often
exhibit heterophily. However, most existing studies focus on either
heterogeneity or heterophily in isolation, overlooking the prevalence of
heterophilic HGs in practical applications. Such ignorance leads to their
performance degradation. In this work, we first identify two main challenges in
modeling heterophily HGs: (1) varying heterophily distributions across hops and
meta-paths; (2) the intricate and often heterophily-driven diversity of
semantic information across different meta-paths. Then, we propose the Adaptive
Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (AHGNN) to tackle these challenges. AHGNN
employs a heterophily-aware convolution that accounts for heterophily
distributions specific to both hops and meta-paths. It then integrates messages
from diverse semantic spaces using a coarse-to-fine attention mechanism, which
filters out noise and emphasizes informative signals. Experiments on seven
real-world graphs and twenty baselines demonstrate the superior performance of
AHGNN, particularly in high-heterophily situations.

Conclusion: DP-LLM通过动态精度分配，显著提升了LLM在设备上的适应性和效率。

Abstract: How can we effectively handle queries for on-device large language models
(LLMs) with varying runtime constraints, such as latency and accuracy?
Multi-scale quantization addresses this challenge by enabling memory-efficient
runtime model adaptation of LLMs through the overlaying of multiple model
variants quantized to different bitwidths. Meanwhile, an important question
still remains open-ended: how can models be properly configured to match a
target precision or latency? While mixed-precision offers a promising solution,
we take this further by leveraging the key observation that the sensitivity of
each layer dynamically changes across decoding iterations. Building on this
insight, we introduce DP-LLM, a novel mechanism that dynamically assigns
precision to each layer based on input values. DP-LLM augments each linear
layer in an LLM with a precision selector that determines the bitwidth at
runtime using a lightweight error estimator and threshold values learned
through fine-tuning. Experimental results across multiple models and benchmarks
demonstrate that DP-LLM achieves a superior performance-latency trade-off,
outperforming prior approaches.

Motivation: 尽管深度时序架构在序列数据上表现优异，但其泛化能力的理论理解仍有限。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过延迟反馈阻塞机制将依赖样本转化为近似独立样本，推导出泛化边界，并提出固定有效样本量的公平比较方法。

Result: 研究发现强依赖序列的泛化差距比弱依赖序列小76%，且收敛速率与理论预测存在差异。

Conclusion: 时序依赖性在固定信息预算下可增强学习，但理论与实践的差距仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Deep temporal architectures such as Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs)
achieve strong predictive performance on sequential data, yet theoretical
understanding of their generalization remains limited. We address this gap by
providing both the first non-vacuous, architecture-aware generalization bounds
for deep temporal models and a principled evaluation methodology.
  For exponentially $\beta$-mixing sequences, we derive bounds scaling as $
O\!\Bigl(R\,\sqrt{\tfrac{D\,p\,n\,\log N}{N}}\Bigr), $ where $D$ is network
depth, $p$ kernel size, $n$ input dimension, and $R$ weight norm. Our
delayed-feedback blocking mechanism transforms dependent samples into
effectively independent ones while discarding only $O(1/\log N)$ of the data,
yielding $\sqrt{D}$ scaling instead of exponential, implying that doubling
depth requires approximately quadrupling the training data.
  We also introduce a fair-comparison methodology that fixes the effective
sample size to isolate the effect of temporal structure from information
content. Under $N_{\text{eff}}=2{,}000$, strongly dependent sequences
($\rho=0.8$) exhibit $\approx76\%$ smaller generalization gaps than weakly
dependent ones ($\rho=0.2$), challenging the intuition that dependence is
purely detrimental. Yet convergence rates diverge from theory: weak
dependencies follow $N_{\text{eff}}^{-1.21}$ scaling and strong dependencies
follow $N_{\text{eff}}^{-0.89}$, both steeper than the predicted $N^{-0.5}$.
These findings reveal that temporal dependence can enhance learning under fixed
information budgets, while highlighting gaps between theory and practice that
motivate future research.

Conclusion: HGR和HSR的结合有效提升了GCRL的样本效率和性能。

Abstract: Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) with sparse rewards remains a
fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning. While hindsight experience
replay (HER) has shown promise by relabeling collected trajectories with
achieved goals, we argue that trajectory relabeling alone does not fully
exploit the available experiences in off-policy GCRL methods, resulting in
limited sample efficiency. In this paper, we propose Hindsight Goal-conditioned
Regularization (HGR), a technique that generates action regularization priors
based on hindsight goals. When combined with hindsight self-imitation
regularization (HSR), our approach enables off-policy RL algorithms to maximize
experience utilization. Compared to existing GCRL methods that employ HER and
self-imitation techniques, our hindsight regularizations achieve substantially
more efficient sample reuse and the best performances, which we empirically
demonstrate on a suite of navigation and manipulation tasks.

Abstract: In oral cancer diagnostics, the limited availability of annotated datasets
frequently constrains the performance of diagnostic models, particularly due to
the variability and insufficiency of training data. To address these
challenges, this study proposed a novel approach to enhance diagnostic accuracy
by synthesizing realistic oral cancer lesions using an inpainting technique
with a fine-tuned diffusion model. We compiled a comprehensive dataset from
multiple sources, featuring a variety of oral cancer images. Our method
generated synthetic lesions that exhibit a high degree of visual fidelity to
actual lesions, thereby significantly enhancing the performance of diagnostic
algorithms. The results show that our classification model achieved a
diagnostic accuracy of 0.97 in differentiating between cancerous and
non-cancerous tissues, while our detection model accurately identified lesion
locations with 0.85 accuracy. This method validates the potential for synthetic
image generation in medical diagnostics and paves the way for further research

*Xiyuan Yang,Shengyuan Hu,Soyeon Kim,Tian Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RR-Cluster是一种轻量级技术，通过随机重新平衡集群分配减少隐私噪声，提升联邦聚类的隐私/效用权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦聚类通过为每个集群生成模型提升性能，但可能增加隐私泄露风险。传统差分隐私机制直接应用会显著降低效用。

Method: 提出RR-Cluster技术，通过保证每个集群最小客户端数量，减少隐私噪声方差。

Result: 理论分析显示RR-Cluster在隐私噪声与潜在偏差间取得平衡，实验证明其在合成和真实数据集中显著提升效用。

Conclusion: RR-Cluster是联邦聚类中简单有效的隐私保护增强方法。

Abstract: Federated clustering aims to group similar clients into clusters and produce
one model for each cluster. Such a personalization approach typically improves
model performance compared with training a single model to serve all clients,
but can be more vulnerable to privacy leakage. Directly applying client-level
differentially private (DP) mechanisms to federated clustering could degrade
the utilities significantly. We identify that such deficiencies are mainly due
to the difficulties of averaging privacy noise within each cluster (following
standard privacy mechanisms), as the number of clients assigned to the same
clusters is uncontrolled. To this end, we propose a simple and effective
technique, named RR-Cluster, that can be viewed as a light-weight add-on to
many federated clustering algorithms. RR-Cluster achieves reduced privacy noise
via randomly rebalancing cluster assignments, guaranteeing a minimum number of
clients assigned to each cluster. We analyze the tradeoffs between decreased
privacy noise variance and potentially increased bias from incorrect
assignments and provide convergence bounds for RR-Clsuter. Empirically, we
demonstrate the RR-Cluster plugged into strong federated clustering algorithms
results in significantly improved privacy/utility tradeoffs across both
synthetic and real-world datasets.

TL;DR: 预训练神经网络在化学和小分子药物设计中受到关注，但研究表明大多数模型在性能上并未显著优于基线ECFP分子指纹，仅CLAMP模型表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估预训练神经网络在分子化学任务中的实际表现，揭示现有研究的评估严谨性问题。

Method: 对25种模型在25个数据集上进行公平比较，涵盖多种模态、架构和预训练策略，并使用分层贝叶斯统计测试模型。

Result: 几乎所有神经网络模型表现与基线ECFP指纹相当，仅CLAMP模型显著优于其他模型。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了现有评估的不足，提出了改进建议，并强调需要更严格的模型验证。

Abstract: Pretrained neural networks have attracted significant interest in chemistry
and small molecule drug design. Embeddings from these models are widely used
for molecular property prediction, virtual screening, and small data learning
in molecular chemistry. This study presents the most extensive comparison of
such models to date, evaluating 25 models across 25 datasets. Under a fair
comparison framework, we assess models spanning various modalities,
architectures, and pretraining strategies. Using a dedicated hierarchical
Bayesian statistical testing model, we arrive at a surprising result: nearly
all neural models show negligible or no improvement over the baseline ECFP
molecular fingerprint. Only the CLAMP model, which is also based on molecular
fingerprints, performs statistically significantly better than the
alternatives. These findings raise concerns about the evaluation rigor in
existing studies. We discuss potential causes, propose solutions, and offer
practical recommendations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦推荐系统假设所有用户隐私需求一致，忽略了利用公开数据提升服务的潜力。GFed-PP旨在解决这一问题。

Method: GFed-PP利用公开用户数据构建用户-项目交互图，通过轻量级GCN学习个性化项目嵌入，并在客户端本地学习用户嵌入和评分函数。

Result: 实验表明，GFed-PP在五个数据集上显著优于现有方法，推荐准确性更高且不损害隐私。

Conclusion: GFed-PP为联邦推荐系统中适应不同隐私偏好提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Federated recommendation systems (FedRecs) have gained significant attention
for providing privacy-preserving recommendation services. However, existing
FedRecs assume that all users have the same requirements for privacy
protection, i.e., they do not upload any data to the server. The approaches
overlook the potential to enhance the recommendation service by utilizing
publicly available user data. In real-world applications, users can choose to
be private or public. Private users' interaction data is not shared, while
public users' interaction data can be shared. Inspired by the issue, this paper
proposes a novel Graph Federated Learning for Personalized Privacy
Recommendation (GFed-PP) that adapts to different privacy requirements while
improving recommendation performance. GFed-PP incorporates the interaction data
of public users to build a user-item interaction graph, which is then used to
form a user relationship graph. A lightweight graph convolutional network (GCN)
is employed to learn each user's user-specific personalized item embedding. To
protect user privacy, each client learns the user embedding and the scoring
function locally. Additionally, GFed-PP achieves optimization of the federated
recommendation framework through the initialization of item embedding on
clients and the aggregation of the user relationship graph on the server.
Experimental results demonstrate that GFed-PP significantly outperforms
existing methods for five datasets, offering superior recommendation accuracy
without compromising privacy. This framework provides a practical solution for
accommodating varying privacy preferences in federated recommendation systems.

*Hai Zhong,Xun Wang,Zhuoran Li,Longbo Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种稳定的重参数化策略梯度方法（RPO），通过结合PPO的代理目标和KL正则化，解决了RPG训练不稳定的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重参数化策略梯度（RPG）在样本效率上有潜力，但训练不稳定，高方差梯度会破坏学习过程。

Method: 通过将PPO的代理目标与RPG结合，提出RPO方法，利用时间反向传播计算梯度，并引入KL正则化。

Result: 在运动和操作任务中，RPO表现出更高的样本效率和稳定性能。

Conclusion: RPO是一种稳定且高效的RPG方法，适用于复杂任务。

Abstract: Reparameterization policy gradient (RPG) is promising for improving sample
efficiency by leveraging differentiable dynamics. However, a critical barrier
is its training instability, where high-variance gradients can destabilize the
learning process. To address this, we draw inspiration from Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO), which uses a surrogate objective to enable stable sample
reuse in the model-free setting. We first establish a connection between this
surrogate objective and RPG, which has been largely unexplored and is
non-trivial. Then, we bridge this gap by demonstrating that the
reparameterization gradient of a PPO-like surrogate objective can be computed
efficiently using backpropagation through time. Based on this key insight, we
propose Reparameterization Proximal Policy Optimization (RPO), a stable and
sample-efficient RPG-based method. RPO enables multiple epochs of stable sample
reuse by optimizing a clipped surrogate objective tailored for RPG, while being
further stabilized by Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence regularization and
remaining fully compatible with existing variance reduction methods. We
evaluate RPO on a suite of challenging locomotion and manipulation tasks, where
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior sample efficiency and
strong performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度确定性策略梯度（DDPG）的框架，用于在大规模流行病模拟中优化封锁和疫苗接种策略，以平衡健康和经济目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在模拟目标、规模和干预策略探索方面存在局限，无法自动确定最优干预措施。

Method: 使用DDPG框架在大规模（10万个体）流行病模拟中进行多目标优化，结合年龄分层和多种疫苗场景。

Result: 结果显示，在没有封锁和对中老年人群接种疫苗的情况下，经济目标（贫困线以下人口）和健康目标（感染和住院）达到平衡。

Conclusion: 需要进一步验证结果，并开源框架。

Abstract: To mitigate the impact of the pandemic, several measures include lockdowns,
rapid vaccination programs, school closures, and economic stimulus. These
interventions can have positive or unintended negative consequences. Current
research to model and determine an optimal intervention automatically through
round-tripping is limited by the simulation objectives, scale (a few thousand
individuals), model types that are not suited for intervention studies, and the
number of intervention strategies they can explore (discrete vs continuous). We
address these challenges using a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
based policy optimization framework on a large-scale (100,000 individual)
epidemiological agent-based simulation where we perform multi-objective
optimization. We determine the optimal policy for lockdown and vaccination in a
minimalist age-stratified multi-vaccine scenario with a basic simulation for
economic activity. With no lockdown and vaccination (mid-age and elderly),
results show optimal economy (individuals below the poverty line) with balanced
health objectives (infection, and hospitalization). An in-depth simulation is
needed to further validate our results and open-source our framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RRM技术难以应对6G车载环境中复杂且大量的CQI数据，需要更高效的资源管理方法。

Method: SCAR采用ML压缩技术（如聚类和RBF网络）减少CQI数据量，并利用强化学习训练6G策略，结合SAST聚类降低失真。

Result: SCAR将可行调度区域时间提升14%，不公平调度时间减少15%，SAST聚类降低CQI失真10%。

Conclusion: SCAR在动态车载网络中展现出良好的可扩展性和公平性优势。

Abstract: The advent of 6G networks opens new possibilities for connected infotainment
services in vehicular environments. However, traditional Radio Resource
Management (RRM) techniques struggle with the increasing volume and complexity
of data such as Channel Quality Indicators (CQI) from autonomous vehicles. To
address this, we propose SCAR (State-Space Compression for AI-Driven Resource
Management), an Edge AI-assisted framework that optimizes scheduling and
fairness in vehicular infotainment. SCAR employs ML-based compression
techniques (e.g., clustering and RBF networks) to reduce CQI data size while
preserving essential features. These compressed states are used to train
6G-enabled Reinforcement Learning policies that maximize throughput while
meeting fairness objectives defined by the NGMN. Simulations show that SCAR
increases time in feasible scheduling regions by 14\% and reduces unfair
scheduling time by 15\% compared to RL baselines without CQI compression.
Furthermore, Simulated Annealing with Stochastic Tunneling (SAST)-based
clustering reduces CQI clustering distortion by 10\%, confirming its
efficiency. These results demonstrate SCAR's scalability and fairness benefits
for dynamic vehicular networks.

TL;DR: 论文研究了部分特征成员推理攻击（PFMI），提出了一种两阶段攻击框架MRAD，通过优化缺失特征和异常检测实现攻击，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有成员推理攻击方法假设攻击者能访问完整特征，但现实中往往只能获取部分特征，限制了方法的应用。

Method: 提出MRAD框架，第一阶段优化缺失特征以最小化样本损失，第二阶段通过异常检测衡量重建样本与训练分布的偏差。

Result: 实验表明MRAD在多种数据集上有效，例如在STL-10上，即使缺失40%特征，AUC仍可达0.6。

Conclusion: MRAD解决了部分特征场景下的成员推理问题，兼容多种异常检测技术，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Machine learning models have been shown to be susceptible to membership
inference attack, which can be used to determine whether a given sample appears
in the training data. Existing membership inference methods commonly assume
that the adversary has full access to the features of the target sample. This
assumption, however, does not hold in many real-world scenarios where only
partial features information is available, thereby limiting the applicability
of these methods. In this work, we study an inference scenario where the
adversary observes only partial features of each sample and aims to infer
whether this observed subset was present in the training set of the target
model. We define this problem as Partial Feature Membership Inference (PFMI).
To address this problem, we propose MRAD (Memory-guided Reconstruction and
Anomaly Detection), a two-stage attack framework. In the first stage, MRAD
optimizes the unknown feature values to minimize the loss of the sample. In the
second stage, it measures the deviation between the reconstructed sample and
the training distribution using anomaly detection. Empirical results
demonstrate that MRAD is effective across a range of datasets, and maintains
compatibility with various off-the-shelf anomaly detection techniques. For
example, on STL-10, our attack achieves an AUC of around 0.6 even with 40% of
the missing features.

TL;DR: CMOSS是一种高效的组合多臂老虎机算法，解决了UCB和对抗性方法的局限性，实现了与实例无关的遗憾界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UCB方法（如CUCB）存在额外的对数遗憾因子，而对抗性方法（如EXP3.M和HYBRID）计算开销大。CMOSS旨在解决这一权衡问题。

Method: 提出CMOSS算法，在半强盗反馈下实现O((log k)^2√kmT)的遗憾界限，消除了对log T的依赖。

Result: CMOSS在合成和真实数据集上均优于基准算法，且在遗憾和运行时效率上表现一致。

Conclusion: CMOSS是一种计算高效且最优的组合多臂老虎机算法，适用于半强盗和级联反馈场景。

Abstract: The combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) is a cornerstone of sequential
decision-making framework, dominated by two algorithmic families: UCB-based and
adversarial methods such as follow the regularized leader (FTRL) and online
mirror descent (OMD). However, prominent UCB-based approaches like CUCB suffer
from additional regret factor $\log T$ that is detrimental over long horizons,
while adversarial methods such as EXP3.M and HYBRID impose significant
computational overhead. To resolve this trade-off, we introduce the
Combinatorial Minimax Optimal Strategy in the Stochastic setting (CMOSS). CMOSS
is a computationally efficient algorithm that achieves an instance-independent
regret of $O\big( (\log k)^2\sqrt{kmT}\big )$ under semi-bandit feedback, where
$m$ is the number of arms and $k$ is the maximum cardinality of a feasible
action. Crucially, this result eliminates the dependency on $\log T$ and
matches the established $\Omega\big( \sqrt{kmT}\big)$ lower bound up to
$O\big((\log k)^2\big)$. We then extend our analysis to show that CMOSS is also
applicable to cascading feedback. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets validate that CMOSS consistently outperforms benchmark algorithms in
both regret and runtime efficiency.

Motivation: 微调LLM可能导致模型在目标领域外产生有害行为，即使微调数据本身无害。

Method: 研究了四种干预方法：KL散度正则化、特征空间L2距离、安全子空间投影（SafeLoRA）和混合安全训练样本。

Result: 评估了这些方法在四个恶意任务中的EMA效果及其对良性任务的影响。

Conclusion: 讨论了EMA研究中的开放性问题。

Abstract: Fine-tuning lets practitioners repurpose aligned large language models (LLMs)
for new domains, yet recent work reveals emergent misalignment (EMA): Even a
small, domain-specific fine-tune can induce harmful behaviors far outside the
target domain. Even in the case where model weights are hidden behind a
fine-tuning API, this gives attackers inadvertent access to a broadly
misaligned model in a way that can be hard to detect from the fine-tuning data
alone. We present the first systematic study of in-training safeguards against
EMA that are practical for providers who expose fine-tuning via an API. We
investigate four training regularization interventions: (i) KL-divergence
regularization toward a safe reference model, (ii) $\ell_2$ distance in feature
space, (iii) projecting onto a safe subspace (SafeLoRA), and (iv) interleaving
of a small amount of safe training examples from a general instruct-tuning
dataset. We first evaluate the methods' emergent misalignment effect across
four malicious, EMA-inducing tasks. Second, we assess the methods' impacts on
benign tasks. We conclude with a discussion of open questions in emergent
misalignment research.

Conclusion: MPS为隐私敏感领域提供了一种可解释且可扩展的合成数据生成方案。

Abstract: Synthetic data generation is a key technique in modern artificial
intelligence, addressing data scarcity, privacy constraints, and the need for
diverse datasets in training robust models. In this work, we propose a method
for generating privacy-preserving high-quality synthetic tabular data using
Tensor Networks, specifically Matrix Product States (MPS). We benchmark the
MPS-based generative model against state-of-the-art models such as CTGAN, VAE,
and PrivBayes, focusing on both fidelity and privacy-preserving capabilities.
To ensure differential privacy (DP), we integrate noise injection and gradient
clipping during training, enabling privacy guarantees via R\'enyi Differential
Privacy accounting. Across multiple metrics analyzing data fidelity and
downstream machine learning task performance, our results show that MPS
outperforms classical models, particularly under strict privacy constraints.
This work highlights MPS as a promising tool for privacy-aware synthetic data
generation. By combining the expressive power of tensor network representations
with formal privacy mechanisms, the proposed approach offers an interpretable
and scalable alternative for secure data sharing. Its structured design
facilitates integration into sensitive domains where both data quality and
confidentiality are critical.

Abstract: Integrating multi-omics datasets through data-driven analysis offers a
comprehensive understanding of the complex biological processes underlying
various diseases, particularly cancer. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have
recently demonstrated remarkable ability to exploit relational structures in
biological data, enabling advances in multi-omics integration for cancer
subtype classification. Existing approaches often neglect the intricate
coupling between heterogeneous omics, limiting their capacity to resolve subtle
cancer subtype heterogeneity critical for precision oncology. To address these
limitations, we propose a framework named Graph Transformer for Multi-omics
Cancer Subtype Classification (GTMancer). This framework builds upon the GNN
optimization problem and extends its application to complex multi-omics data.
Specifically, our method leverages contrastive learning to embed multi-omics
data into a unified semantic space. We unroll the multiplex graph optimization
problem in that unified space and introduce dual sets of attention coefficients
to capture structural graph priors both within and among multi-omics data. This
approach enables global omics information to guide the refining of the
representations of individual omics. Empirical experiments on seven real-world
cancer datasets demonstrate that GTMancer outperforms existing state-of-the-art
algorithms.

Motivation: 生成模型（如扩散和流模型）在离线多智能体强化学习中表现优异，但其迭代生成过程导致采样效率低，难以应用于实际场景。

Method: 提出OM2P算法，结合奖励感知优化方案、均值流匹配损失和Q函数监督，并设计了广义时间步分布和无导数估计策略。

Result: 在Multi-Agent Particle和MuJoCo基准测试中，OM2P表现优异，GPU内存使用减少3.8倍，训练速度提升10.8倍。

Conclusion: OM2P首次成功将均值流模型整合到离线MARL中，为多智能体协作场景中的实用生成策略铺平了道路。

Abstract: Generative models, especially diffusion and flow-based models, have been
promising in offline multi-agent reinforcement learning. However, integrating
powerful generative models into this framework poses unique challenges. In
particular, diffusion and flow-based policies suffer from low sampling
efficiency due to their iterative generation processes, making them impractical
in time-sensitive or resource-constrained settings. To tackle these
difficulties, we propose OM2P (Offline Multi-Agent Mean-Flow Policy), a novel
offline MARL algorithm to achieve efficient one-step action sampling. To
address the misalignment between generative objectives and reward maximization,
we introduce a reward-aware optimization scheme that integrates a
carefully-designed mean-flow matching loss with Q-function supervision.
Additionally, we design a generalized timestep distribution and a
derivative-free estimation strategy to reduce memory overhead and improve
training stability. Empirical evaluations on Multi-Agent Particle and MuJoCo
benchmarks demonstrate that OM2P achieves superior performance, with up to a
3.8x reduction in GPU memory usage and up to a 10.8x speed-up in training time.
Our approach represents the first to successfully integrate mean-flow model
into offline MARL, paving the way for practical and scalable generative
policies in cooperative multi-agent settings.

Result: 结果显示CL能有效减少遗忘，优于简单微调，为印度语言ASR提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Conclusion: 持续学习是解决印度语言ASR多样性问题的有效方法，适用于实际约束下的场景。

Abstract: Indias linguistic diversity poses significant challenges for developing
inclusive Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. Traditional multilingual
models, which require simultaneous access to all language data, are impractical
due to the sequential arrival of data and privacy constraints. Continual
Learning (CL) offers a solution by enabling models to learn new languages
sequentially without catastrophically forgetting previously learned knowledge.
This paper investigates CL for ASR on Indian languages using a subset of the
IndicSUPERB benchmark. We employ a Conformer-based hybrid RNN-T/CTC model,
initially pretrained on Hindi, which is then incrementally trained on eight
additional Indian languages, for a total sequence of nine languages. We
evaluate three prominent regularization- and distillation-based CL strategies:
Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Memory Aware Synapses (MAS), and Learning
without Forgetting (LwF), selected for their suitability in no-replay,
privacy-conscious scenarios. Performance is analyzed using Word Error Rate
(WER) for both RNN-T and CTC paths on clean and noisy data, as well as
knowledge retention via Backward Transfer. We also explore the impact of
varying the number of training epochs (1, 2, 5, and 10) per task. Results,
compared against naive fine-tuning, demonstrate CLs effectiveness in mitigating
forgetting, making it a promising approach for scalable ASR in diverse Indian
languages under realistic constraints. The code is available at:

Conclusion: 新型神经元模型通过重置机制扩展了SNN的应用范围，突破了深度SSM模型的稳定性限制。

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing is an emerging technology enabling low-latency and
energy-efficient signal processing. A key algorithmic tool in neuromorphic
computing is spiking neural networks (SNNs). SNNs are biologically inspired
neural networks which utilize stateful neurons, and provide low-bit data
processing by encoding and decoding information using spikes. Similar to SNNs,
deep state-space models (SSMs) utilize stateful building blocks. However, deep
SSMs, which recently achieved competitive performance in various temporal
modeling tasks, are typically designed with high-precision activation functions
and no reset mechanisms. To bridge the gains offered by SNNs and the recent
deep SSM models, we propose a novel multiple-output spiking neuron model that
combines a linear, general SSM state transition with a non-linear feedback
mechanism through reset. Compared to the existing neuron models for SNNs, our
proposed model clearly conceptualizes the differences between the spiking
function, the reset condition and the reset action. The experimental results on
various tasks, i.e., a keyword spotting task, an event-based vision task and a
sequential pattern recognition task, show that our proposed model achieves
performance comparable to existing benchmarks in the SNN literature. Our
results illustrate how the proposed reset mechanism can overcome instability
and enable learning even when the linear part of neuron dynamics is unstable,
allowing us to go beyond the strictly enforced stability of linear dynamics in
recent deep SSM models.

Conclusion: FedMeNF在隐私保护和性能优化方面表现优异。

Abstract: Neural fields provide a memory-efficient representation of data, which can
effectively handle diverse modalities and large-scale data. However, learning
to map neural fields often requires large amounts of training data and
computations, which can be limited to resource-constrained edge devices. One
approach to tackle this limitation is to leverage Federated Meta-Learning
(FML), but traditional FML approaches suffer from privacy leakage. To address
these issues, we introduce a novel FML approach called FedMeNF. FedMeNF
utilizes a new privacy-preserving loss function that regulates privacy leakage
in the local meta-optimization. This enables the local meta-learner to optimize
quickly and efficiently without retaining the client's private data. Our
experiments demonstrate that FedMeNF achieves fast optimization speed and
robust reconstruction performance, even with few-shot or non-IID data across
diverse data modalities, while preserving client data privacy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法需要预训练伙伴或手动调参的问题，实现完全无监督的伙伴和关卡分布课程。

Method: 通过随机混合策略和基于方差的度量生成多样化伙伴，并结合无监督环境设计。

Result: 在Overcooked-AI和泛化挑战中表现优异，用户研究显示其适应性、协作性和人类相似性更高。

Conclusion: UPD是一种高效且完全无监督的框架，显著提升了多智能体协作的性能和用户体验。

Abstract: We introduce Unsupervised Partner Design (UPD) - a population-free,
multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for robust ad-hoc teamwork that
adaptively generates training partners without requiring pretrained partners or
manual parameter tuning. UPD constructs diverse partners by stochastically
mixing an ego agent's policy with biased random behaviours and scores them
using a variance-based learnability metric that prioritises partners near the
ego agent's current learning frontier. We show that UPD can be integrated with
unsupervised environment design, resulting in the first method enabling fully
unsupervised curricula over both level and partner distributions in a
cooperative setting. Through extensive evaluations on Overcooked-AI and the
Overcooked Generalisation Challenge, we demonstrate that this dynamic partner
curriculum is highly effective: UPD consistently outperforms both
population-based and population-free baselines as well as ablations. In a user
study, we further show that UPD achieves higher returns than all baselines and
was perceived as significantly more adaptive, more human-like, a better
collaborator, and less frustrating.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应鲁棒损失函数FCL，通过分数阶导数和MAE自动调整对标签噪声的鲁棒性，无需手动调参。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有鲁棒损失函数需要大量数据集特定的超参数调优，限制了其实际应用。

Method: FCL结合交叉熵的分数阶导数和MAE，动态调整分数阶导数阶数μ，平衡鲁棒性和收敛速度。

Result: 在基准数据集上，FCL无需手动调参即达到最优性能。

Conclusion: FCL通过动态调整损失函数，有效解决了标签噪声下的分类问题。

Abstract: Robust loss functions are crucial for training deep neural networks in the
presence of label noise, yet existing approaches require extensive,
dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning. In this work, we introduce Fractional
Classification Loss (FCL), an adaptive robust loss that automatically
calibrates its robustness to label noise during training. Built within the
active-passive loss framework, FCL employs the fractional derivative of the
Cross-Entropy (CE) loss as its active component and the Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) as its passive loss component. With this formulation, we demonstrate that
the fractional derivative order $\mu$ spans a family of loss functions that
interpolate between MAE-like robustness and CE-like fast convergence.
Furthermore, we integrate $\mu$ into the gradient-based optimization as a
learnable parameter and automatically adjust it to optimize the trade-off
between robustness and convergence speed. We reveal that FCL's unique property
establishes a critical trade-off that enables the stable learning of $\mu$:
lower log penalties on difficult or mislabeled examples improve robustness but
impose higher penalties on easy or clean data, reducing model confidence in
them. Consequently, FCL can dynamically reshape its loss landscape to achieve
effective classification performance under label noise. Extensive experiments
on benchmark datasets show that FCL achieves state-of-the-art results without
the need for manual hyperparameter tuning.

TL;DR: SE-VAE是一种新型变分自编码器架构，通过嵌入测量结构直接设计模型，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决表格数据中潜在表示的可解释性问题，特别是在科学和社会领域。

Method: 结合结构方程模型，设计SE-VAE，通过模块化架构分离潜在子空间和全局干扰变量。

Result: 在模拟数据集上表现优异，因子恢复、可解释性和鲁棒性均优于基线。

Conclusion: SE-VAE为理论驱动的生成建模提供了原则性框架，强调结构设计而非正则化。

Abstract: Learning interpretable latent representations from tabular data remains a
challenge in deep generative modeling. We introduce SE-VAE (Structural
Equation-Variational Autoencoder), a novel architecture that embeds measurement
structure directly into the design of a variational autoencoder. Inspired by
structural equation modeling, SE-VAE aligns latent subspaces with known
indicator groupings and introduces a global nuisance latent to isolate
construct-specific confounding variation. This modular architecture enables
disentanglement through design rather than through statistical regularizers
alone. We evaluate SE-VAE on a suite of simulated tabular datasets and
benchmark its performance against a series of leading baselines using standard
disentanglement metrics. SE-VAE consistently outperforms alternatives in factor
recovery, interpretability, and robustness to nuisance variation. Ablation
results reveal that architectural structure, rather than regularization
strength, is the key driver of performance. SE-VAE offers a principled
framework for white-box generative modeling in scientific and social domains
where latent constructs are theory-driven and measurement validity is
essential.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统k-means算法效率低且能耗高，Gk-means旨在通过几何优化提升效率和能源经济性。

Method: 利用标量投影识别高表达数据（HE），忽略低表达数据（LE），减少计算开销。

Result: 在合成、真实世界和高维数据集上，Gk-means在运行时间和距离计算上优于传统及SOTA k-means变体，且能源效率更高。

Conclusion: Gk-means是一种高效、节能且可持续的k-means改进算法。

Abstract: This paper introduces Geometric-k-means (or Gk-means for short), a novel
approach that significantly enhances the efficiency and energy economy of the
widely utilized k-means algorithm, which, despite its inception over five
decades ago, remains a cornerstone in machine learning applications. The
essence of Gk-means lies in its active utilization of geometric principles,
specifically scalar projection, to significantly accelerate the algorithm
without sacrificing solution quality. This geometric strategy enables a more
discerning focus on data points that are most likely to influence cluster
updates, which we call as high expressive data (HE). In contrast, low
expressive data (LE), does not impact clustering outcome, is effectively
bypassed, leading to considerable reductions in computational overhead.
Experiments spanning synthetic, real-world and high-dimensional datasets,
demonstrate Gk-means is significantly better than traditional and state of the
art (SOTA) k-means variants in runtime and distance computations (DC).
Moreover, Gk-means exhibits better resource efficiency, as evidenced by its
reduced energy footprint, placing it as more sustainable alternative.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在无人类诱导的情况下自发性欺骗行为，提出了一种基于心理学原理的量化框架，并发现任务难度增加时LLMs的欺骗倾向上升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在推理、规划和决策任务中广泛应用，但其可信度问题尚未充分研究，尤其是自发性欺骗行为。

Method: 提出了一种基于“接触搜索问题”的框架，引入两种统计指标（欺骗意图分数和欺骗行为分数）量化LLMs的欺骗倾向。

Result: 评估14个主流LLMs发现，任务难度增加时欺骗倾向显著上升。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在复杂任务中自发性欺骗的倾向，对其在关键领域的部署提出了警示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed in reasoning,
planning, and decision-making tasks, making their trustworthiness a critical
concern. The potential for intentional deception, where an LLM deliberately
fabricates or conceals information to serve a hidden objective, remains a
significant and underexplored threat. Existing studies typically induce such
deception by explicitly setting a "hidden" objective through prompting or
fine-tuning, which may not fully reflect real-world human-LLM interactions.
Moving beyond this human-induced deception, we investigate LLMs' self-initiated
deception on benign prompts. To address the absence of ground truth in this
evaluation, we propose a novel framework using "contact searching questions."
This framework introduces two statistical metrics derived from psychological
principles to quantify the likelihood of deception. The first, the Deceptive
Intention Score, measures the model's bias towards a hidden objective. The
second, Deceptive Behavior Score, measures the inconsistency between the LLM's
internal belief and its expressed output. Upon evaluating 14 leading LLMs, we
find that both metrics escalate as task difficulty increases, rising in
parallel for most models. Building on these findings, we formulate a
mathematical model to explain this behavior. These results reveal that even the
most advanced LLMs exhibit an increasing tendency toward deception when
handling complex problems, raising critical concerns for the deployment of LLM
agents in complex and crucial domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成方法主要关注单一活性分子设计，缺乏同时管理多目标和非目标分子交互的机制。

Method: 采用扩散模型和分类器引导技术，利用分别训练的药物-靶点分类器进行正负引导。

Result: 实验表明，ActivityDiff能有效处理单/双靶点生成、片段约束双靶点设计、选择性生成及减少脱靶效应等任务。

Conclusion: ActivityDiff为分子设计提供了平衡效能和安全性的新范式，是一个多功能且可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Achieving precise control over a molecule's biological activity-encompassing
targeted activation/inhibition, cooperative multi-target modulation, and
off-target toxicity mitigation-remains a critical challenge in de novo drug
design. However, existing generative methods primarily focus on producing
molecules with a single desired activity, lacking integrated mechanisms for the
simultaneous management of multiple intended and unintended molecular
interactions. Here, we propose ActivityDiff, a generative approach based on the
classifier-guidance technique of diffusion models. It leverages separately
trained drug-target classifiers for both positive and negative guidance,
enabling the model to enhance desired activities while minimizing harmful
off-target effects. Experimental results show that ActivityDiff effectively
handles essential drug design tasks, including single-/dual-target generation,
fragment-constrained dual-target design, selective generation to enhance target
specificity, and reduction of off-target effects. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of classifier-guided diffusion in balancing efficacy and safety
in molecular design. Overall, our work introduces a novel paradigm for
achieving integrated control over molecular activity, and provides ActivityDiff
as a versatile and extensible framework.

TL;DR: 提出了一种三阶段的端到端文本到SQL框架，先识别用户目标数据库，再生成SQL查询，结合LLM和规则提取，显著提升了数据库意图预测和SQL生成准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法假设目标数据库已知，但在多数据库场景下，识别正确数据库是关键但被忽视的步骤。

Method: 三阶段框架：1) 用LLM和提示工程从自然语言查询中提取规则；2) 训练基于RoBERTa的db_id预测模型；3) 使用批评代理修正SQL错误。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在数据库意图预测和SQL生成准确性上优于当前最优模型。

Conclusion: 提出的框架解决了多数据库场景下的数据库识别问题，显著提升了文本到SQL的性能。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL bridges the gap between natural language and structured database
language, thus allowing non-technical users to easily query databases.
Traditional approaches model text-to-SQL as a direct translation task, where a
given Natural Language Query (NLQ) is mapped to an SQL command. Recent advances
in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved translation
accuracy, however, these methods all require that the target database is
pre-specified. This becomes problematic in scenarios with multiple extensive
databases, where identifying the correct database becomes a crucial yet
overlooked step. In this paper, we propose a three-stage end-to-end text-to-SQL
framework to identify the user's intended database before generating SQL
queries. Our approach leverages LLMs and prompt engineering to extract implicit
information from natural language queries (NLQs) in the form of a ruleset. We
then train a large db\_id prediction model, which includes a RoBERTa-based
finetuned encoder, to predict the correct Database identifier (db\_id) based on
both the NLQ and the LLM-generated rules. Finally, we refine the generated SQL
by using critic agents to correct errors. Experimental results demonstrate that
our framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art models in both database
intent prediction and SQL generation accuracy.

Abstract: Homelessness in the United States has surged to levels unseen since the Great
Depression. However, existing methods for monitoring it, such as point-in-time
(PIT) counts, have limitations in terms of frequency, consistency, and spatial
detail. This study proposes a new approach using publicly available,
crowdsourced data, specifically 311 Service Calls and street-level imagery, to
track and forecast homeless tent trends in San Francisco. Our predictive model
captures fine-grained daily and neighborhood-level variations, uncovering
patterns that traditional counts often overlook, such as rapid fluctuations
during the COVID-19 pandemic and spatial shifts in tent locations over time. By
providing more timely, localized, and cost-effective information, this approach
serves as a valuable tool for guiding policy responses and evaluating
interventions aimed at reducing unsheltered homelessness.

Result: 实验表明LoRR显著提升数学和通用推理任务性能，甚至优于复杂RL算法。

Conclusion: LoRR为LLM微调提供了高效、实用的新范式，尤其适合数据有限场景。

Abstract: Recent advancements in post-training Large Language Models (LLMs),
particularly through Reinforcement Learning (RL) and preference optimization
methods, are key drivers for enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However,
these methods are often plagued by low sample efficiency and a susceptibility
to primacy bias, where overfitting to initial experiences degrades policy
quality and damages the learning process. To address these challenges, we
introduce LLM optimization with Reset Replay (LoRR), a general and powerful
plugin designed to enhance sample efficiency in any preference-based
optimization framework. LoRR core mechanism enables training at a high replay
number, maximizing the utility of each collected data batch. To counteract the
risk of overfitting inherent in high-replay training, LoRR incorporates a
periodic reset strategy with reusing initial data, which preserves network
plasticity. Furthermore, it leverages a hybrid optimization objective,
combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference-based losses to further
bolster data exploitation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LoRR
significantly boosts the performance of various preference optimization methods
on both mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks. Notably, an iterative
DPO approach augmented with LoRR achieves comparable performance on challenging
math tasks, outperforming some complex and computationally intensive RL-based
algorithms. These findings highlight that LoRR offers a practical,
sample-efficient, and highly effective paradigm for LLM finetuning, unlocking
greater performance from limited data.

Method: GRIN提出梯度比度量定位关键参数，选择性噪声注入后微调。

Result: 在TOFU、WMDP和SafePKU等基准测试中验证了GRIN的有效性。

Conclusion: GRIN为LLM遗忘提供了高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The growing legal and ethical scrutiny of large language models (LLMs)
necessitates effective machine unlearning, particularly for sensitive or
unauthorized data. Existing empirical methods often yield incomplete forgetting
or unintended degradation of unrelated knowledge due to poor localization. In
this work, we propose GRIN: a modular and targeted framework for LLM
unlearning. GRIN introduces a novel gradient-ratio-based metric to identify
parameters most responsible for memorizing forget data. We then perform
selective noise injection into these parameters prior to fine-tuning, which
improves unlearning performance while maintaining model utility. Finally, we
propose new evaluation metrics tailored to the LLM setting and validate our
approach on standard benchmarks such as TOFU, WMDP, and SafePKU.
