Second, we introduce a Hierarchical Sparse Attention (HSA)\nmechanism that adaptively adjusts attention patterns according to a variety of\ninput lengths, reducing computational complexity from O($n^2$) to O($n$) while\nmaintaining model performance.

Evaluating whether\nLLM-generated annotations align with those generated by expert humans is\nchallenging to do at scale, and currently, no validated, scalable measure of\nsimilarity in ideas exists. In this paper, we (i) introduce the scalable\nevaluation of interpretive annotation by LLMs as a critical and understudied\ntask, (ii) propose IDEAlgin, an intuitive benchmarking paradigm for capturing\nexpert similarity ratings via a \"pick-the-odd-one-out\" triplet judgment task,\nand (iii) evaluate various similarity metrics, including vector-based ones\n(topic models, embeddings) and LLM-as-a-judge via IDEAlgin, against these human\nbenchmarks.

We identify\nthe shortcomings in the current benchmarks, where we show that a single frame\ncan often suffice for capturing the motion referring expression without any\ntemporal reasoning. To address this, we introduce four motion-centric probing\ntechniques, particularly designed for the visual grounding task, to study video\nMLLMs' ability to identify true motion from a fake one and their ability to\ngrasp the motion order. Consequently, we provide a motion-centric benchmark,\nMoCentric-Bench.

Those targets are extracted by\niterative LLM Self-Refine conditioned on compressed future observations\nrepresented by Tree of Captions. The VLWM learns both an action policy and a\ndynamics model, which respectively facilitates reactive system-1 plan decoding\nand reflective system-2 planning via cost minimization. The cost evaluates the\nsemantic distance between the hypothetical future states given by VLWM\nroll-outs and the expected goal state, and is measured by a critic model that\nwe trained in a self-supervised manner. The VLWM achieves state-of-the-art\nVisual Planning for Assistance (VPA) performance on both benchmark evaluations\nand our proposed PlannerArena human evaluations, where system-2 improves the\nElo score by +27% upon system-1. The VLWM models also outperforms strong VLM\nbaselines on RoboVQA and WorldPrediction benchmark."}

The model incorporates positional encodings of observations together\nwith modality encodings, derived from a text embedding model applied to a\ndescription of each modality. This design enables the model to scale to an\narbitrary number of modalities, making it straightforward to add new ones not\nconsidered in the initial design. We currently include eight modalities\nspanning directional angles, categorical classes, and continuous properties\nsuch as temperature and thickness. These capabilities support in-context\nlearning, enabling the model to generate predictions either with no inputs or\nwith an arbitrary number of additional observations from any subset of\nmodalities. On validation data, this reduces errors in predicting stress angle\nby more than a factor of three. The proposed architecture is scalable and\ndemonstrates improved performance with increased parameters. Together, these\nadvances make the Transparent Earth an initial foundation model for the Earth's\nsubsurface that ultimately aims to predict any subsurface property anywhere on\nEarth."}

Recent multimodal methods, motivated by CLIP, introduce semantic\ncues to guide visual understanding.

Twofold goals are examined; to understand the\nmechanism underlying successful pre-training and to determine the interplay\nbetween the pre-training accuracy and the fine-tuning of classification tasks.\nThe following main results were obtained; the accuracy per token (APT)\nincreased with its appearance frequency in the dataset, and its average over\nall tokens served as an order parameter to quantify pre-training success, which\nincreased along the transformer blocks. Pre-training broke the symmetry among\ntokens and grouped them into finite, small, strong match token clusters, as\ninferred from the presented token confusion matrix. This feature was sharpened\nalong the transformer blocks toward the output layer, enhancing its performance\nconsiderably compared with that of the embedding layer. Consequently,\nhigher-order language structures were generated by pre-training, even though\nthe learning cost function was directed solely at identifying a single token.\nThese pre-training findings were reflected by the improved fine-tuning accuracy\nalong the transformer blocks. Additionally, the output label prediction\nconfidence was found to be independent of the average input APT, as the input\nmeaning was preserved since the tokens are replaced primarily by strong match\ntokens.

Although the agent in\nthe choose phase paradigm selects the next active phase adaptively, this\nparadigm may result in unexpected phase sequences for drivers, disrupting their\nanticipation and potentially compromising safety at intersections.

While our\nprimary focus is on breast cancer, our framework is designed to easily\naccommodate additional modalities, offering the flexibility to scale up or down\nwith minimal overhead without requiring re-training of existing modalities,\nmaking it applicable to other types of cancers as well. We introduce a\ndual-based representation for whole slide images (WSIs), combining traditional\nimage-based and graph-based WSI representations. This novel dual approach\nresults in significant performance improvements. Moreover, we present a new\nmultimodal fusion strategy, demonstrating its ability to enhance performance\nacross a range of multimodal conditions. Our comprehensive results show that\nintegrating our dual-based WSI representation with CNV and clinical health\nrecords, along with our pipeline and fusion strategy, outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in breast cancer subtyping."}

Specifically, given a \\textit{source}\nrepresentation drawn from a source RS, the rules of structure transfer allow us\nto generate a \\textit{target} representation for a target RS. The generality of\nstructure transfer comes in part from its ability to ensure that the source\nrepresentation and the generated target representation satisfy \\textit{any}\nspecified relation (such as semantic equivalence). This is done by exploiting\n\\textit{schemas}, which encode knowledge about RSs. Specifically, schemas can\nexpress \\textit{preservation of information} across relations between any pair\nof RSs, and this knowledge is used by structure transfer to derive a structure\nfor the target representation which ensures that the desired relation holds. We\nformalise this using Representational Systems Theory~\\cite{raggi2022rst},\nbuilding on the key concept of a \\textit{construction space}.

To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a\nsynthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs\nwith spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces\ndiverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates\ntemporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and\ntemporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their\nlocations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our\napproach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal\nreferences, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for\nreal-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human\nannotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental\nevaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform\nbaselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation.

However, the rational design of\nsynthetic epitope libraries is challenging due to the large combinatorial\nsequence space, $20^n$ combinations for linear epitopes of n amino acids,\nmaking screening and testing unfeasible, even with high throughput experimental\ntechniques. In this study, we present a large language model, epiGPTope,\npre-trained on protein data and specifically fine-tuned on linear epitopes,\nwhich for the first time can directly generate novel epitope-like sequences,\nwhich are found to possess statistical properties analogous to the ones of\nknown epitopes. This generative approach can be used to prepare libraries of\nepitope candidate sequences. We further train statistical classifiers to\npredict whether an epitope sequence is of bacterial or viral origin, thus\nnarrowing the candidate library and increasing the likelihood of identifying\nspecific epitopes. We propose that such combination of generative and\npredictive models can be of assistance in epitope discovery.

Recently, data-driven approaches, particularly those based on\ngraph neural networks (GNNs), have shown progress in tackling such problems.\nHowever, these approaches are often limited to learning fluid behavior in\nstatic free-fall environments or simple manipulation settings involving\nprimitive objects, often overlooking complex interactions with dynamically\nmoving kinematic rigid bodies.

This approach enables the\nnetwork to model complex interactions between liquid particles and intricate\nsurface geometries.

During training,\nconverting model weights and activations into low-precision formats, i.e.,\nquantization, can drastically reduce training times, energy consumption, and\ncost, and is thus a widely used technique. In this work, we demonstrate that\nquantization causes significantly higher accuracy degradation in DP-SGD\ncompared to regular SGD. We observe that this is caused by noise injection in\nDP-SGD, which amplifies quantization variance, leading to disproportionately\nlarge accuracy degradation. To address this challenge, we present QPQuant, a\ndynamic quantization framework that adaptively selects a changing subset of\nlayers to quantize at each epoch. Our method combines two key ideas that\neffectively reduce quantization variance: (i) probabilistic sampling of the\nlayers that rotates which layers are quantized every epoch, and (ii) loss-aware\nlayer prioritization, which uses a differentially private loss sensitivity\nestimator to identify layers that can be quantized with minimal impact on model\nquality. This estimator consumes a negligible fraction of the overall privacy\nbudget, preserving DP guarantees.

To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a\nsynthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs\nwith spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces\ndiverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates\ntemporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and\ntemporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their\nlocations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our\napproach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal\nreferences, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for\nreal-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human\nannotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental\nevaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform\nbaselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation.

We present here a\nsummary and snapshot of the MPS community's perspective, as of Spring/Summer\n2025, in a rapidly developing field. The link between AI and MPS is becoming\nincreasingly inextricable; now is a crucial moment to strengthen the link\nbetween AI and Science by pursuing a strategy that proactively and thoughtfully\nleverages the potential of AI for scientific discovery and optimizes\nopportunities to impact the development of AI by applying concepts from\nfundamental science. To achieve this, we propose activities and strategic\npriorities that: (1) enable AI+MPS research in both directions; (2) build up an\ninterdisciplinary community of AI+MPS researchers; and (3) foster education and\nworkforce development in AI for MPS researchers and students.

However, even when optimized, these operators can be\nexpensive to execute on millions of records and their iterator execution\nsemantics make them ill-suited for interactive data analytics tasks. In another\nline of work, Deep Research systems have demonstrated an ability to answer\nnatural language question(s) over large datasets. These systems use one or more\nLLM agent(s) to plan their execution, process the dataset(s), and iteratively\nrefine their answer. However, these systems do not explicitly optimize their\nquery plans which can lead to poor plan execution. In order for AI-driven\nanalytics to excel, we need a runtime which combines the optimized execution of\nsemantic operators with the flexibility and more dynamic execution of Deep\nResearch systems. As a first step towards this vision, we build a prototype\nwhich enables Deep Research agents to write and execute optimized semantic\noperator programs. We evaluate our prototype and demonstrate that it can\noutperform a handcrafted semantic operator program and open Deep Research\nsystems on two basic queries. Compared to a standard open Deep Research agent,\nour prototype achieves up to 1.95x better F1-score. Furthermore, even if we\ngive the agent access to semantic operators as tools, our prototype still\nachieves cost and runtime savings of up to 76.8% and 72.7% thanks to its\noptimized execution."}

Therefore, we propose a set of efficient new algorithms\nthat update a bidiagonal factorization, and which are similarly accurate as the\nSVD methods. In particular, we develop a compact Householder-type algorithm\nthat decouples a sparse part from a low-rank update and has about half the\nmemory requirements of standard bidiagonalization methods. A second algorithm\nbased on Givens rotations has only about 10 flops per rotation and scales\nquadratically with the problem size, compared to a typical cubic scaling.

However,\ncurrent existing methods present some limitations: (i) some approaches fail to\nexplicitly capture the relationship between structural changes and time\nintervals, especially when trained on age-imbalanced datasets; (ii) others rely\nonly on scan interpolation, which lack clinical utility, as they generate\nintermediate images between timepoints rather than future pathological\nprogression; and (iii) most approaches rely on 2D slice-based architectures,\nthereby disregarding full 3D anatomical context, which is essential for\naccurate longitudinal predictions. We propose a 3D Temporally-Aware Diffusion\nModel (TADM-3D), which accurately predicts brain progression on MRI volumes. To\nbetter model the relationship between time interval and brain changes, TADM-3D\nuses a pre-trained Brain-Age Estimator (BAE) that guides the diffusion model in\nthe generation of MRIs that accurately reflect the expected age difference\nbetween baseline and generated follow-up scans.

To alleviate\nthis burden, we present Count2Density: a novel pipeline designed to predict\nmeaningful density maps containing quantitative spatial information using only\ncount-level annotations (i.e., total number of people) during training. To\nachieve this, Count2Density generates pseudo-density maps leveraging past\npredictions stored in a Historical Map Bank, thereby reducing confirmation\nbias. This bank is initialised using an unsupervised saliency estimator to\nprovide an initial spatial prior and is iteratively updated with an EMA of\npredicted density maps. These pseudo-density maps are obtained by sampling\nlocations from estimated crowd areas using a hypergeometric distribution, with\nthe number of samplings determined by the count-level annotations.
