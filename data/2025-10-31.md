### [1] [Enhancing Underwater Object Detection through Spatio-Temporal Analysis and Spatial Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25797)
*Sai Likhith Karri,Ansh Saxena*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了时空建模和空间注意力机制在深度学习模型中对水下物体检测的有效性，比较了YOLOv5、T-YOLOv5和T-YOLOv5+CBAM三种模型，发现时空增强模型显著提高了检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决动态海洋环境中水下物体检测的挑战，特别是在突然运动、部分遮挡和渐变运动条件下，需要提高检测模型的准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: 第一阶段评估了T-YOLOv5与标准YOLOv5的性能；第二阶段开发了集成卷积块注意力模块(CBAM)的T-YOLOv5增强版本，通过比较三种模型来验证时空建模和注意力机制的有效性。

Result: 测试结果显示：YOLOv5的mAP@50-95为0.563，T-YOLOv5为0.813，T-YOLOv5+CBAM为0.811。时空增强模型在检测复杂物体方面表现出更高的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: T-YOLOv5相比标准模型显著提高了检测可靠性，而T-YOLOv5+CBAM在挑战性场景中进一步提升了性能，但在简单场景中会出现精度损失。

Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of spatio-temporal modeling and the
integration of spatial attention mechanisms in deep learning models for
underwater object detection. Specifically, in the first phase, the performance
of temporal-enhanced YOLOv5 variant T-YOLOv5 is evaluated, in comparison with
the standard YOLOv5. For the second phase, an augmented version of T-YOLOv5 is
developed, through the addition of a Convolutional Block Attention Module
(CBAM). By examining the effectiveness of the already pre-existing YOLOv5 and
T-YOLOv5 models and of the newly developed T-YOLOv5 with CBAM. With CBAM, the
research highlights how temporal modeling improves detection accuracy in
dynamic marine environments, particularly under conditions of sudden movements,
partial occlusions, and gradual motion. The testing results showed that YOLOv5
achieved a mAP@50-95 of 0.563, while T-YOLOv5 and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
outperformed with mAP@50-95 scores of 0.813 and 0.811, respectively,
highlighting their superior accuracy and generalization in detecting complex
objects. The findings demonstrate that T-YOLOv5 significantly enhances
detection reliability compared to the standard model, while T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
further improves performance in challenging scenarios, although there is a loss
of accuracy when it comes to simpler scenarios.

### [2] [MIRO: MultI-Reward cOnditioned pretraining improves T2I quality and efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25897)
*Nicolas Dufour,Lucas Degeorge,Arijit Ghosh,Vicky Kalogeiton,David Picard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIRO方法通过在训练期间让模型学习多个奖励模型的条件，直接学习用户偏好，从而显著提高生成图像质量并加速训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成模型在大规模未筛选数据集上训练以实现多样化生成能力，但这与用户偏好不一致。现有的奖励模型方法通过后处理选择图像会损害多样性、语义保真度和效率。

Method: 提出MIRO方法，在训练期间让模型学习多个奖励模型的条件，直接学习用户偏好，而不是进行后处理。

Result: MIRO在GenEval组合基准和用户偏好评分（PickAScore、ImageReward、HPSv2）上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过直接学习用户偏好而不是后处理，MIRO方法显著提高了生成图像的视觉质量并加速了训练过程。

Abstract: Current text-to-image generative models are trained on large uncurated
datasets to enable diverse generation capabilities. However, this does not
align well with user preferences. Recently, reward models have been
specifically designed to perform post-hoc selection of generated images and
align them to a reward, typically user preference. This discarding of
informative data together with the optimizing for a single reward tend to harm
diversity, semantic fidelity and efficiency. Instead of this post-processing,
we propose to condition the model on multiple reward models during training to
let the model learn user preferences directly. We show that this not only
dramatically improves the visual quality of the generated images but it also
significantly speeds up the training. Our proposed method, called MIRO,
achieves state-of-the-art performances on the GenEval compositional benchmark
and user-preference scores (PickAScore, ImageReward, HPSv2).

### [3] [BikeScenes: Online LiDAR Semantic Segmentation for Bicycles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25901)
*Denniz Goren,Holger Caesar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了针对自行车安全的3D LiDAR分割方法，创建了BikeScenes-lidarseg数据集，通过在自行车特定领域微调，将mIoU从13.8%提升到63.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着电动自行车日益普及，骑行者面临的安全风险增加，需要将汽车感知技术适配到自行车安全领域。

Method: 使用多传感器'SenseBike'研究平台，开发并评估了针对自行车的3D LiDAR分割方法，创建了包含3021个连续LiDAR扫描的BikeScenes-lidarseg数据集，包含29个动态和静态类别的语义标注。

Result: 在BikeScenes数据集上微调后，平均交并比(mIoU)达到63.6%，显著优于仅使用SemanticKITTI预训练的13.8%。

Conclusion: 领域特定训练对自行车感知系统至关重要，BikeScenes数据集为以骑行者为中心的LiDAR分割研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: The vulnerability of cyclists, exacerbated by the rising popularity of faster
e-bikes, motivates adapting automotive perception technologies for bicycle
safety. We use our multi-sensor 'SenseBike' research platform to develop and
evaluate a 3D LiDAR segmentation approach tailored to bicycles. To bridge the
automotive-to-bicycle domain gap, we introduce the novel BikeScenes-lidarseg
Dataset, comprising 3021 consecutive LiDAR scans around the university campus
of the TU Delft, semantically annotated for 29 dynamic and static classes. By
evaluating model performance, we demonstrate that fine-tuning on our BikeScenes
dataset achieves a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 63.6%, significantly
outperforming the 13.8% obtained with SemanticKITTI pre-training alone. This
result underscores the necessity and effectiveness of domain-specific training.
We highlight key challenges specific to bicycle-mounted, hardware-constrained
perception systems and contribute the BikeScenes dataset as a resource for
advancing research in cyclist-centric LiDAR segmentation.

### [4] [Generative Image Restoration and Super-Resolution using Physics-Informed Synthetic Data for Scanning Tunneling Microscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25921)
*Nikola L. Kolev,Tommaso Rodani,Neil J. Curson,Taylor J. Z. Stock,Alberto Cazzaniga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于机器学习的STM图像修复和超分辨率方法，使用仅36张原始实验图像训练物理信息合成数据生成模型，能有效修复图像并减少2-4倍图像采集时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扫描隧道显微镜中针尖退化和缓慢串行数据采集的限制，减少针尖调节频率并提高实验吞吐量。

Method: 使用物理信息合成数据生成管道训练最先进的流匹配和扩散模型，通过稀疏采样数据准确重建图像。

Result: 模型能有效修复图像，通过CLIP最大均值差异得分和结构相似性定量评估，实现2-4倍的图像采集时间减少。

Conclusion: 该框架有潜力显著提高STM实验吞吐量，减少针尖调节频率并增强现有高速STM系统的帧率。

Abstract: Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) enables atomic-resolution imaging and
atom manipulation, but its utility is often limited by tip degradation and slow
serial data acquisition. Fabrication adds another layer of complexity since the
tip is often subjected to large voltages, which may alter the shape of its
apex, requiring it to be conditioned. Here, we propose a machine learning (ML)
approach for image repair and super-resolution to alleviate both challenges.
Using a dataset of only 36 pristine experimental images of Si(001):H, we
demonstrate that a physics-informed synthetic data generation pipeline can be
used to train several state-of-the-art flow-matching and diffusion models.
Quantitative evaluation with metrics such as the CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(CMMD) score and structural similarity demonstrates that our models are able to
effectively restore images and offer a two- to fourfold reduction in image
acquisition time by accurately reconstructing images from sparsely sampled
data. Our framework has the potential to significantly increase STM
experimental throughput by offering a route to reducing the frequency of
tip-conditioning procedures and to enhancing frame rates in existing high-speed
STM systems.

### [5] [SplitFlow: Flow Decomposition for Inversion-Free Text-to-Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25970)
*Sung-Hoon Yoon,Minghan Li,Gaspard Beaudouin,Congcong Wen,Muhammad Rafay Azhar,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于流分解与聚合的图像编辑框架，通过语义分解目标提示词、独立计算子流并聚合来避免反转过程，解决了现有方法在图像编辑中的反转不准确和梯度纠缠问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Rectified flow模型在图像生成方面表现出色，但在图像编辑任务中存在反转过程不准确和梯度纠缠问题，导致编辑结果无法忠实反映目标提示。

Method: 采用流分解与聚合框架：将目标提示词语义分解为多个子提示词，为每个子提示词计算独立流，然后通过投影和软聚合机制自适应加权子目标速度场，抑制语义冗余并强调不同方向。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在语义保真度和属性解缠方面优于现有的零样本编辑方法。

Conclusion: 提出的流分解与聚合框架有效解决了图像编辑中的反转和梯度纠缠问题，实现了更好的语义一致性和多样性保持。

Abstract: Rectified flow models have become a de facto standard in image generation due
to their stable sampling trajectories and high-fidelity outputs. Despite their
strong generative capabilities, they face critical limitations in image editing
tasks: inaccurate inversion processes for mapping real images back into the
latent space, and gradient entanglement issues during editing often result in
outputs that do not faithfully reflect the target prompt. Recent efforts have
attempted to directly map source and target distributions via ODE-based
approaches without inversion; however,these methods still yield suboptimal
editing quality. In this work, we propose a flow decomposition-and-aggregation
framework built upon an inversion-free formulation to address these
limitations. Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into
multiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them
to form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that
decomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space,
generating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance
toward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and
soft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution
in multi-task learning. This approach adaptively weights the sub-target
velocity fields, suppressing semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct
directions, thereby preserving both diversity and consistency in the final
edited output. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing zero-shot editing approaches in terms of semantic fidelity and
attribute disentanglement. The code is available at
https://github.com/Harvard-AI-and-Robotics-Lab/SplitFlow.

### [6] [Brain-IT: Image Reconstruction from fMRI via Brain-Interaction Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25976)
*Roman Beliy,Amit Zalcher,Jonathan Kogman,Navve Wasserman,Michal Irani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Brain-IT方法，通过脑交互变换器(BIT)从fMRI脑记录重建视觉图像，实现更忠实于实际所见图像的生成效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的方法在从fMRI重建图像时缺乏对实际所见图像的忠实度，需要更有效的脑功能交互机制

Method: 使用脑交互变换器(BIT)，通过功能相似的脑体素簇之间的交互，预测高层语义特征和低层结构特征来指导扩散模型

Result: 在视觉和客观指标上都超越了当前最先进方法，仅用1小时fMRI数据就能达到与40小时训练相当的效果

Conclusion: Brain-IT通过脑功能簇交互和双重特征预测，实现了更忠实的图像重建，显著提高了数据效率

Abstract: Reconstructing images seen by people from their fMRI brain recordings
provides a non-invasive window into the human brain. Despite recent progress
enabled by diffusion models, current methods often lack faithfulness to the
actual seen images. We present "Brain-IT", a brain-inspired approach that
addresses this challenge through a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT),
allowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similar
brain-voxels. These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as
building blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All
model components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient
training with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT
predicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level
semantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic
content of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to
initialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image.
BIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to
localized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image
reconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and
surpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective
metrics. Moreover, with only 1-hour of fMRI data from a new subject, we achieve
results comparable to current methods trained on full 40-hour recordings.

### [7] [Fine-tuning Segment Anything for Real-Time Tumor Tracking in Cine-MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25990)
*Valentin Boussot,Cédric Hémon,Jean-Claude Nunes,Jean-Louis Dillenseger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文针对TrackRAD2025挑战，在数据稀缺条件下使用SAM 2.1基础模型进行实时MRI肿瘤跟踪，最终在测试集上获得0.8794的Dice分数，排名第6。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在数据稀缺约束下对胸腹部区域MRI序列进行实时肿瘤跟踪的挑战，探索基础模型在医学影像分析中的潜力。

Method: 采用SAM 2.1基础模型，使用第一帧标注切片作为mask提示，在TrackRAD2025的小规模标注数据上进行微调，采用平衡的Dice+IoU损失函数和低学习率策略防止过拟合。

Result: 在隐藏测试集上达到0.8794的Dice相似系数，在TrackRAD2025挑战中排名第6位，证明了基础模型在实时MRI肿瘤跟踪中的有效性。

Conclusion: 基础模型在MRI引导的放射治疗中具有准确、实时肿瘤跟踪的强大潜力，特别是在数据稀缺条件下仍能取得良好性能。

Abstract: In this work, we address the TrackRAD2025 challenge of real-time tumor
tracking in cine-MRI sequences of the thoracic and abdominal regions under
strong data scarcity constraints. Two complementary strategies were explored:
(i) unsupervised registration with the IMPACT similarity metric and (ii)
foundation model-based segmentation leveraging SAM 2.1 and its recent variants
through prompt-based interaction. Due to the one-second runtime constraint, the
SAM-based method was ultimately selected. The final configuration used SAM2.1
b+ with mask-based prompts from the first annotated slice, fine-tuned solely on
the small labeled subset from TrackRAD2025. Training was configured to minimize
overfitting, using 1024x1024 patches (batch size 1), standard augmentations,
and a balanced Dice + IoU loss. A low uniform learning rate (0.0001) was
applied to all modules (prompt encoder, decoder, Hiera backbone) to preserve
generalization while adapting to annotator-specific styles. Training lasted 300
epochs (~12h on RTX A6000, 48GB). The same inference strategy was consistently
applied across all anatomical sites and MRI field strengths. Test-time
augmentation was considered but ultimately discarded due to negligible
performance gains. The final model was selected based on the highest Dice
Similarity Coefficient achieved on the validation set after fine-tuning. On the
hidden test set, the model reached a Dice score of 0.8794, ranking 6th overall
in the TrackRAD2025 challenge. These results highlight the strong potential of
foundation models for accurate and real-time tumor tracking in MRI-guided
radiotherapy.

### [8] [Larger Hausdorff Dimension in Scanning Pattern Facilitates Mamba-Based Methods in Low-Light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26001)
*Xinhua Wang,Caibo Feng,Xiangjun Fu,Chunxiao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进Mamba框架的方法，通过Hilbert选择性扫描机制增加扫描模式的Hausdorff维度，从而更有效地探索特征空间，提升低光图像增强性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Mamba框架在低光图像增强中存在信息不一致和空间局部性不足的问题，需要更有效地捕捉精细细节和局部交互。

Method: 采用Hilbert选择性扫描机制，增加扫描模式的Hausdorff维度，改善特征空间探索，同时保持处理长距离依赖的能力。

Result: 在公开基准测试中显著提升了定量指标和定性视觉质量，同时减少了计算资源消耗和推理时间。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅推进了低光图像增强的技术水平，也为基于Mamba技术的更广泛应用提供了潜力。

Abstract: We propose an innovative enhancement to the Mamba framework by increasing the
Hausdorff dimension of its scanning pattern through a novel Hilbert Selective
Scan mechanism. This mechanism explores the feature space more effectively,
capturing intricate fine-scale details and improving overall coverage. As a
result, it mitigates information inconsistencies while refining spatial
locality to better capture subtle local interactions without sacrificing the
model's ability to handle long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments on
publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves both the quantitative metrics and qualitative visual fidelity of
existing Mamba-based low-light image enhancement methods, all while reducing
computational resource consumption and shortening inference time. We believe
that this refined strategy not only advances the state-of-the-art in low-light
image enhancement but also holds promise for broader applications in fields
that leverage Mamba-based techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAVE是首个真实世界视觉异常基准，支持异常描述、解释和论证三个开放任务，包含细粒度标注，用于评估视觉语言模型在检测和理解异常方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算机视觉中的异常检测主要局限于工业缺陷或合成异常，无法捕捉真实世界异常的丰富性和不可预测性，而人类能够自然地识别、推理和解释环境中的异常。

Method: CAVE基准基于认知科学研究，提供视觉定位和异常分类的细粒度标注，包括异常的可视表现、复杂性、严重性和常见性，并设计了三个开放任务来评估VLMs。

Result: 实验表明，即使采用先进的提示策略，最先进的视觉语言模型在视觉异常感知和常识推理方面仍存在困难。

Conclusion: CAVE作为一个现实且认知基础扎实的基准，为推进异常检测和VLMs中的常识推理研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify, reason about, and explain anomalies in their
environment. In computer vision, this long-standing challenge remains limited
to industrial defects or unrealistic, synthetically generated anomalies,
failing to capture the richness and unpredictability of real-world anomalies.
In this work, we introduce CAVE, the first benchmark of real-world visual
anomalies. CAVE supports three open-ended tasks: anomaly description,
explanation, and justification; with fine-grained annotations for visual
grounding and categorizing anomalies based on their visual manifestations,
their complexity, severity, and commonness. These annotations draw inspiration
from cognitive science research on how humans identify and resolve anomalies,
providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) in detecting and understanding anomalies. We show that state-of-the-art
VLMs struggle with visual anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning, even
with advanced prompting strategies. By offering a realistic and cognitively
grounded benchmark, CAVE serves as a valuable resource for advancing research
in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in VLMs.

*Bilal Hassan,Areg Karapetyan,Aaron Chung Hin Chow,Samer Madanat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级CNN模型，用于预测不同海平面上升情景下的沿海洪水，在阿布扎比和旧金山两个不同地理区域验证了模型的泛化能力，平均减少洪水深度预测误差近20%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化和海平面上升对沿海城市构成日益严重的威胁，传统物理模拟器计算成本高，深度学习技术面临数据稀缺和高维输出等挑战，需要开发高效准确的洪水预测方法。

Method: 利用基于视觉的低资源深度学习框架，开发了轻量级卷积神经网络模型，能够预测不同海平面上升预测和海岸线适应情景下的沿海洪水。

Conclusion: 该方法具有作为可扩展实用工具的潜力，可用于沿海洪水管理，帮助决策者制定有效的缓解策略以应对气候变化日益增长的影响。

Abstract: Climate change and sea-level rise (SLR) pose escalating threats to coastal
cities, intensifying the need for efficient and accurate methods to predict
potential flood hazards. Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic simulators,
although precise, are computationally expensive and impractical for city-scale
coastal planning applications. Deep Learning (DL) techniques offer promising
alternatives, however, they are often constrained by challenges such as data
scarcity and high-dimensional output requirements. Leveraging a recently
proposed vision-based, low-resource DL framework, we develop a novel,
lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model designed to predict
coastal flooding under variable SLR projections and shoreline adaptation
scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of the model to generalize
across diverse geographical contexts by utilizing datasets from two distinct
regions: Abu Dhabi and San Francisco. Our findings demonstrate that the
proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing the
mean absolute error (MAE) in predicted flood depth maps on average by nearly
20%. These results highlight the potential of our approach to serve as a
scalable and practical tool for coastal flood management, empowering
decision-makers to develop effective mitigation strategies in response to the
growing impacts of climate change. Project Page: https://caspiannet.github.io/

*Ali Rasekh,Erfan Bagheri Soula,Omid Daliran,Simon Gottschalk,Mohsen Fayyaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种在视觉编码器中引入堆叠时序注意力模块的Video-LLM架构，显著提升了视频时序理解能力，在多个基准测试中性能提升达5.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在理解视频复杂时序动态方面存在严重局限，难以处理需要详细理解动作序列和时序进展的任务。

Method: 在视觉编码器中直接引入堆叠时序注意力模块，通过时序注意力机制使模型能更好地捕捉动作进展和帧间关系，然后再将视觉token传递给LLM。

Result: 该方法显著改善了时序推理能力，在视频问答任务特别是动作识别方面优于现有模型，在VITATECS、MVBench和Video-MME等基准测试中性能提升最高达5.5%。

Conclusion: 通过增强视觉编码器的时序结构，解决了Video-LLMs在视频理解方面的关键缺陷。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
understanding complex temporal dynamics in videos remains a major challenge.
Our experiments show that current Video Large Language Model (Video-LLM)
architectures have critical limitations in temporal understanding, struggling
with tasks that require detailed comprehension of action sequences and temporal
progression. In this work, we propose a Video-LLM architecture that introduces
stacked temporal attention modules directly within the vision encoder. This
design incorporates a temporal attention in vision encoder, enabling the model
to better capture the progression of actions and the relationships between
frames before passing visual tokens to the LLM. Our results show that this
approach significantly improves temporal reasoning and outperforms existing
models in video question answering tasks, specifically in action recognition.
We improve on benchmarks including VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME by up to
+5.5%. By enhancing the vision encoder with temporal structure, we address a
critical gap in video understanding for Video-LLMs. Project page and code are

### [12] [FlexICL: A Flexible Visual In-context Learning Framework for Elbow and Wrist Ultrasound Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26049)
*Yuyue Zhou,Jessica Knight,Shrimanti Ghosh,Banafshe Felfeliyan,Jacob L. Jaremko,Abhilash R. Hareendranathan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FlexICL框架，通过少量标注帧实现超声图像中骨骼区域的自动分割，在仅需5%训练图像的情况下优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决肘部和腕部骨折超声图像分割中像素级专家标注耗时且成本高的问题，帮助训练不足的用户更自信地进行检查

Method: 提出FlexICL框架，采用上下文学习策略，研究多种图像拼接技术和训练策略，结合多种增强方法实现鲁棒分割

Result: 在4个腕部和肘部超声数据集上，仅使用5%训练图像即优于Painter、MAE-VQGAN、U-Net和TransUNet等模型，Dice系数提升1-27%

Conclusion: FlexICL为超声图像分割提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，特别适用于标注数据稀缺的医学影像应用场景

Abstract: Elbow and wrist fractures are the most common fractures in pediatric
populations. Automatic segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound
(US) can improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Fractures appear
as cortical defects but require expert interpretation. Deep learning (DL) can
provide real-time feedback and highlight key structures, helping lightly
trained users perform exams more confidently. However, pixel-wise expert
annotations for training remain time-consuming and costly. To address this
challenge, we propose FlexICL, a novel and flexible in-context learning (ICL)
framework for segmenting bony regions in US images. We apply it to an
intra-video segmentation setting, where experts annotate only a small subset of
frames, and the model segments unseen frames. We systematically investigate
various image concatenation techniques and training strategies for visual ICL
and introduce novel concatenation methods that significantly enhance model
performance with limited labeled data. By integrating multiple augmentation
strategies, FlexICL achieves robust segmentation performance across four wrist
and elbow US datasets while requiring only 5% of the training images. It
outperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models like Painter, MAE-VQGAN, and
conventional segmentation models like U-Net and TransUNet by 1-27% Dice
coefficient on 1,252 US sweeps. These initial results highlight the potential
of FlexICL as an efficient and scalable solution for US image segmentation well
suited for medical imaging use cases where labeled data is scarce.

### [13] [Dynamic VLM-Guided Negative Prompting for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26052)
*Hoyeon Chang,Seungjin Kim,Yoonseok Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言模型的动态负提示方法，在扩散模型去噪过程中自适应生成负提示，相比传统固定负提示方法有更好的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统负提示方法使用固定的负提示，无法根据生成过程中的具体内容进行动态调整，限制了负提示的效果。

Method: 在特定去噪步骤生成中间图像预测，然后查询视觉语言模型来生成上下文相关的负提示，实现动态负提示生成。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上评估，展示了负引导强度与文本-图像对齐之间的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 动态负提示方法能够更有效地利用负引导，在保持文本-图像对齐的同时提升生成质量。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for dynamic negative prompting in diffusion
models that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to adaptively generate
negative prompts during the denoising process. Unlike traditional Negative
Prompting methods that use fixed negative prompts, our method generates
intermediate image predictions at specific denoising steps and queries a VLM to
produce contextually appropriate negative prompts. We evaluate our approach on
various benchmark datasets and demonstrate the trade-offs between negative
guidance strength and text-image alignment.

*Xiaosen Wang,Zhijin Ge,Shaokang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PReMA攻击方法，通过仅修改输入图像而不改变提示词来操纵多模态扩散模型的输出内容，特别是在图像编辑应用中造成安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态扩散模型中文本和图像模态的对齐不足，存在生成不当内容的风险，特别是在固定提示词的图像编辑应用中。

Method: 提出Prompt-Restricted Multi-modal Attack (PReMA)，通过创建对抗性图像来操纵模型输出，而不需要修改提示词本身。

Result: 在图像修复和风格迁移任务上的综合评估证实了PReMA的有效性，能够成功操纵模型生成内容。

Conclusion: PReMA对多模态扩散模型的完整性构成了新的威胁，特别是在使用固定提示词的图像编辑应用中。

Abstract: Despite the notable advancements and versatility of multi-modal diffusion
models, such as text-to-image models, their susceptibility to adversarial
inputs remains underexplored. Contrary to expectations, our investigations
reveal that the alignment between textual and Image modalities in existing
diffusion models is inadequate. This misalignment presents significant risks,
especially in the generation of inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW)
content. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Prompt-Restricted
Multi-modal Attack (PReMA) to manipulate the generated content by modifying the
input image in conjunction with any specified prompt, without altering the
prompt itself. PReMA is the first attack that manipulates model outputs by
solely creating adversarial images, distinguishing itself from prior methods

Consequently, PReMA poses a novel threat to the integrity of multi-modal

fixed prompts. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on image inpainting and
style transfer tasks across various models confirm the potent efficacy of
PReMA.

*Minjoon Jung,Junbin Xiao,Junghyun Kim,Byoung-Tak Zhang,Angela Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EgoExo-Con基准，用于评估视频LLM在不同视角下的一致性时间理解能力，并开发了View-GRPO强化学习框架来提升跨视角一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视频LLM在不同视角下能否保持时间理解的一致性，现有模型在这方面存在明显不足。

Method: 引入EgoExo-Con基准，包含同步的自我视角和外部视角视频对，提出View-GRPO强化学习框架来增强跨视角一致性理解。

Result: 现有视频LLM在跨视角一致性方面表现较差，View-GRPO方法相比传统微调和GRPO在提升跨视角一致性方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 跨视角时间理解一致性是视频LLM的重要挑战，View-GRPO为提升这一能力提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Can Video-LLMs achieve consistent temporal understanding when videos capture
the same event from different viewpoints? To study this, we introduce
EgoExo-Con (Consistency), a benchmark of comprehensively synchronized
egocentric and exocentric video pairs with human-refined queries in natural
language. EgoExo-Con emphasizes two temporal understanding tasks: Temporal
Verification and Temporal Grounding. It evaluates not only correctness but
consistency across viewpoints. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations of
existing Video-LLMs: (1) models often fail to maintain consistency, with
results far worse than their single-view performances. (2) When naively
finetuned with synchronized videos of both viewpoints, the models show improved
consistency but often underperform those trained on a single view. For
improvements, we propose View-GRPO, a novel reinforcement learning framework
that effectively strengthens view-specific temporal reasoning while encouraging
consistent comprehension across viewpoints. Our method demonstrates its
superiority over naive SFT and GRPO, especially for improving cross-view
consistency. All resources will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出了OracleAgent，首个用于甲骨文结构化管理和检索的智能体系统，集成多种甲骨文分析工具和多模态知识库，显著提升甲骨文研究效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲骨文研究面临两个主要挑战：(1) 甲骨文解读涉及复杂的串行和并行子任务流程；(2) 甲骨文信息组织和检索效率低下，学者需要花费大量时间搜索、整理和管理相关资源。

Method: 开发OracleAgent智能体系统，集成多个甲骨文分析工具（基于大语言模型），灵活编排这些组件。构建包含140万单字拓片图像和8万条解读文本的领域专用多模态知识库。

Result: 实验表明OracleAgent在多模态推理和生成任务中表现优异，超越主流多模态大语言模型（如GPT-4o）。案例研究显示能有效协助领域专家，显著降低甲骨文研究的时间成本。

Conclusion: OracleAgent是甲骨文辅助研究和自动解读系统实际部署的重要进展，为甲骨文研究提供了实用的智能化解决方案。

Abstract: As one of the earliest writing systems, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) preserves
the cultural and intellectual heritage of ancient civilizations. However,
current OBS research faces two major challenges: (1) the interpretation of OBS
involves a complex workflow comprising multiple serial and parallel sub-tasks,
and (2) the efficiency of OBS information organization and retrieval remains a
critical bottleneck, as scholars often spend substantial effort searching for,
compiling, and managing relevant resources. To address these challenges, we
present OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured
management and retrieval of OBS-related information. OracleAgent seamlessly
integrates multiple OBS analysis tools, empowered by large language models
(LLMs), and can flexibly orchestrate these components. Additionally, we
construct a comprehensive domain-specific multimodal knowledge base for OBS,
which is built through a rigorous multi-year process of data collection,
cleaning, and expert annotation. The knowledge base comprises over 1.4M
single-character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts. OracleAgent
leverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in
retrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior
performance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks,
surpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g.,
GPT-4o). Furthermore, our case study illustrates that OracleAgent can
effectively assist domain experts, significantly reducing the time cost of OBS
research. These results highlight OracleAgent as a significant step toward the
practical deployment of OBS-assisted research and automated interpretation
systems.

*Yuxuan Li,Tao Wang,Xianben Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合优化3D高斯点和相机姿态的统一框架，无需预校准输入，通过交替优化策略同时提升场景重建保真度和姿态精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统新视角合成方法依赖外部相机姿态估计工具（如COLMAP），存在计算瓶颈和误差传播问题，需要消除对预校准输入的依赖。

Method: 将联合优化解耦为两个交替阶段：固定姿态下通过可微分渲染更新3D高斯参数；使用结合几何和光度约束的自定义3D光流算法优化相机姿态。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛评估表明，该方法在重建质量上显著优于现有的无COLMAP技术，并且总体上超越了基于COLMAP的标准基线。

Conclusion: 该联合优化框架能够有效处理大视角变化和稀疏特征分布等挑战性场景，逐步减少投影误差，实现高质量的新视角合成。

Abstract: Traditional novel view synthesis methods heavily rely on external camera pose
estimation tools such as COLMAP, which often introduce computational
bottlenecks and propagate errors. To address these challenges, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes 3D Gaussian points and camera poses
without requiring pre-calibrated inputs. Our approach iteratively refines 3D
Gaussian parameters and updates camera poses through a novel co-optimization
strategy, ensuring simultaneous improvements in scene reconstruction fidelity
and pose accuracy. The key innovation lies in decoupling the joint optimization
into two interleaved phases: first, updating 3D Gaussian parameters via
differentiable rendering with fixed poses, and second, refining camera poses
using a customized 3D optical flow algorithm that incorporates geometric and
photometric constraints. This formulation progressively reduces projection
errors, particularly in challenging scenarios with large viewpoint variations
and sparse feature distributions, where traditional methods struggle. Extensive
evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly
outperforms existing COLMAP-free techniques in reconstruction quality, and also
surpasses the standard COLMAP-based baseline in general.

Conclusion: WOD-E2E数据集和RFS评估指标填补了当前端到端驾驶评估的空白，为开发能够处理复杂现实世界场景的自动驾驶系统提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in
the research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily
feature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of
these systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall
short in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating
performance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021
driving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging
long-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring
frequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the
high-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8
surrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail
situations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback
Score (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between
predicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted
trajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have
released rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while
the held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.
Through our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into
generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of
handling complex real-world situations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出将基于梯度的网络注意力信息与CNN特征表示相结合，用于改进RGB-D室内SLAM中的帧关联性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然注意力模型和可视化技术能够识别CNN在图像识别任务中的关注区域，但这些基于梯度的注意力信息直接集成到CNN表示中以进行语义对象理解的应用仍然有限。特别是在SLAM等视觉任务中，增强空间注意力对象位置的CNN表示可以提升性能。

Method: 利用任务特定的网络注意力，将来自网络梯度的层间注意力信息与CNN特征表示相集成，以改进帧关联性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，与基线方法相比性能有所提升，特别是在大型环境中表现更佳。

Conclusion: 将梯度注意力信息与CNN特征结合可以有效提升RGB-D室内SLAM系统的性能，特别是在复杂环境中。

Abstract: Attention models have recently emerged as a powerful approach, demonstrating
significant progress in various fields. Visualization techniques, such as class
activation mapping, provide visual insights into the reasoning of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). Using network gradients, it is possible to identify
regions where the network pays attention during image recognition tasks.
Furthermore, these gradients can be combined with CNN features to localize more
generalizable, task-specific attentive (salient) regions within scenes.
However, explicit use of this gradient-based attention information integrated
directly into CNN representations for semantic object understanding remains
limited. Such integration is particularly beneficial for visual tasks like
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), where CNN representations
enriched with spatially attentive object locations can enhance performance. In
this work, we propose utilizing task-specific network attention for RGB-D
indoor SLAM. Specifically, we integrate layer-wise attention information
derived from network gradients with CNN feature representations to improve
frame association performance. Experimental results indicate improved
performance compared to baseline methods, particularly for large environments.

Conclusion: FullPart通过结合隐式和显式表示的优势，有效解决了3D部件生成中的几何细节不足和小部件质量下降问题，为未来3D部件生成研究提供了有价值的框架和数据集。

Abstract: Part-based 3D generation holds great potential for various applications.
Previous part generators that represent parts using implicit vector-set tokens
often suffer from insufficient geometric details. Another line of work adopts
an explicit voxel representation but shares a global voxel grid among all
parts; this often causes small parts to occupy too few voxels, leading to
degraded quality. In this paper, we propose FullPart, a novel framework that
combines both implicit and explicit paradigms. It first derives the bounding
box layout through an implicit box vector-set diffusion process, a task that
implicit diffusion handles effectively since box tokens contain little
geometric detail. Then, it generates detailed parts, each within its own fixed
full-resolution voxel grid. Instead of sharing a global low-resolution space,
each part in our method - even small ones - is generated at full resolution,
enabling the synthesis of intricate details. We further introduce a
center-point encoding strategy to address the misalignment issue when
exchanging information between parts of different actual sizes, thereby
maintaining global coherence. Moreover, to tackle the scarcity of reliable part
data, we present PartVerse-XL, the largest human-annotated 3D part dataset to
date with 40K objects and 320K parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FullPart achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation. We will
release all code, data, and model to benefit future research in 3D part
generation.

Conclusion: BasicAVSR不仅推进了任意尺度视频超分辨率的技术水平，还将其核心组件扩展到多种框架以适应多样化场景，为视频超分辨率领域提供了强有力的基线方法。

Abstract: Arbitrary-scale video super-resolution (AVSR) aims to enhance the resolution
of video frames, potentially at various scaling factors, which presents several
challenges regarding spatial detail reproduction, temporal consistency, and
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a strong baseline BasicAVSR
for AVSR by integrating four key components: 1) adaptive multi-scale frequency
priors generated from image Laplacian pyramids, 2) a flow-guided propagation
unit to aggregate spatiotemporal information from adjacent frames, 3) a
second-order motion compensation unit for more accurate spatial alignment of
adjacent frames, and 4) a hyper-upsampling unit to generate scale-aware and
content-independent upsampling kernels. To meet diverse application demands, we
instantiate three propagation variants: (i) a unidirectional RNN unit for
strictly online inference, (ii) a unidirectional RNN unit empowered with a
limited lookahead that tolerates a small output delay, and (iii) a
bidirectional RNN unit designed for offline tasks where computational resources
are less constrained. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
adaptability of our model across these different scenarios. Through extensive
experiments, we show that BasicAVSR significantly outperforms existing methods
in terms of super-resolution quality, generalization ability, and inference
speed. Our work not only advances the state-of-the-art in AVSR but also extends
its core components to multiple frameworks for diverse scenarios. The code is

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are essential for training robust Computer-Aided
Diagnosis (CAD) models for breast cancer detection or risk prediction. However,
acquiring such datasets with fine-detailed annotation is both costly and
time-consuming. Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, which are
pre-trained on large image-text pairs, offer a promising solution by enhancing
robustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks. This paper introduces
a novel Multi-View Mammography and Language Model for breast cancer
classification and risk prediction, trained on a dataset of paired mammogram
images and synthetic radiology reports. Our MV-MLM leverages multi-view
supervision to learn rich representations from extensive radiology data by
employing cross-modal self-supervision across image-text pairs. This includes
multiple views and the corresponding pseudo-radiology reports. We propose a
novel joint visual-textual learning strategy to enhance generalization and
accuracy performance over different data types and tasks to distinguish breast
tissues or cancer characteristics(calcification, mass) and utilize these
patterns to understand mammography images and predict cancer risk. We evaluated
our method on both private and publicly available datasets, demonstrating that
the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three
classification tasks: (1) malignancy classification, (2) subtype
classification, and (3) image-based cancer risk prediction. Furthermore, the
model exhibits strong data efficiency, outperforming existing fully supervised
or VLM baselines while trained on synthetic text reports and without the need
for actual radiology reports.

Abstract: Modes of transportation vary across countries depending on geographical
location and cultural context. In South Asian countries rickshaws are among the
most common means of local transport. Based on their mode of operation,
rickshaws in cities across Bangladesh can be broadly classified into non-auto
(pedal-powered) and auto-rickshaws (motorized). Monitoring the movement of
auto-rickshaws is necessary as traffic rules often restrict auto-rickshaws from
accessing certain routes. However, existing surveillance systems make it quite
difficult to monitor them due to their similarity to other vehicles, especially
non-auto rickshaws whereas manual video analysis is too time-consuming. This
paper presents a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect
auto-rickshaws in traffic images. In this system, we used real-time object
detection using the YOLOv8 model. For training purposes, we prepared a set of
1,730 annotated images that were captured under various traffic conditions. The
results show that our proposed model performs well in real-time auto-rickshaw
detection and offers an mAP50 of 83.447% and binary precision and recall values
above 78%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling both dense and sparse
traffic scenarios. The dataset has been publicly released for further research.

Abstract: Wearable devices such as smart glasses are transforming the way people
interact with their surroundings, enabling users to seek information regarding
entities in their view. Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG)
plays a key role in supporting such questions, yet there is still no
comprehensive benchmark for this task, especially regarding wearables
scenarios. To fill this gap, we present CRAG-MM -- a Comprehensive RAG
benchmark for Multi-modal Multi-turn conversations. CRAG-MM contains a diverse
set of 6.5K (image, question, answer) triplets and 2K visual-based multi-turn
conversations across 13 domains, including 6.2K egocentric images designed to
mimic captures from wearable devices. We carefully constructed the questions to
reflect real-world scenarios and challenges, including five types of
image-quality issues, six question types, varying entity popularity, differing
information dynamism, and different conversation turns. We design three tasks:
single-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn
conversations -- each paired with an associated retrieval corpus and APIs for
both image-KG retrieval and webpage retrieval. Our evaluation shows that
straightforward RAG approaches achieve only 32% and 43% truthfulness on CRAG-MM
single- and multi-turn QA, respectively, whereas state-of-the-art industry
solutions have similar quality (32%/45%), underscoring ample room for
improvement. The benchmark has hosted KDD Cup 2025, attracting about 1K
participants and 5K submissions, with winning solutions improving baseline
performance by 28%, highlighting its early impact on advancing the field.

Motivation: 现有从单张模糊图像提取运动信息的方法（如模糊核和光流）质量较低，存在粗粒度和不准确的问题，需要开发高质量的运动轨迹估计方法。

Method: MoTDiff包含两个关键组件：1）使用从单张模糊图像提取的多尺度特征图作为条件的条件扩散框架；2）新的训练方法，促进精确识别细粒度运动轨迹、一致估计运动路径整体形状和位置、以及沿运动轨迹的像素连通性。

Result: 实验证明MoTDiff在盲图像去模糊和编码曝光摄影应用中优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 提出的MoTDiff框架能够从单张运动模糊图像中估计高质量的高分辨率运动轨迹，在多个应用中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of motion information is crucial in diverse computational
imaging and computer vision applications. Researchers have investigated various
methods to extract motion information from a single blurred image, including
blur kernels and optical flow. However, existing motion representations are
often of low quality, i.e., coarse-grained and inaccurate. In this paper, we
propose the first high-resolution (HR) Motion Trajectory estimation framework
using Diffusion models (MoTDiff). Different from existing motion
representations, we aim to estimate an HR motion trajectory with high-quality
from a single motion-blurred image. The proposed MoTDiff consists of two key
components: 1) a new conditional diffusion framework that uses multi-scale
feature maps extracted from a single blurred image as a condition, and 2) a new
training method that can promote precise identification of a fine-grained
motion trajectory, consistent estimation of overall shape and position of a
motion path, and pixel connectivity along a motion trajectory. Our experiments
demonstrate that the proposed MoTDiff can outperform state-of-the-art methods
in both blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography applications.

TL;DR: ConceptScope是一个可扩展的自动化框架，使用稀疏自编码器分析视觉数据集中的概念偏差，无需精细标注即可发现和量化人类可解释的概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习数据集中普遍存在数据集偏差，但系统识别这些偏差需要昂贵的细粒度属性标注，因此需要开发无需标注的自动化偏差检测方法。

Method: 利用视觉基础模型的表示训练稀疏自编码器，将概念分为目标、上下文和偏差类型，基于语义相关性和统计相关性进行类别级数据集表征、偏差识别和鲁棒性评估。

Result: ConceptScope能够捕获广泛的视觉概念，包括物体、纹理、背景、面部属性、情感和动作，并能检测已知偏差（如Waterbirds中的背景偏差）和发现未标注的偏差（如ImageNet中的共现物体）。

Conclusion: ConceptScope为数据集审计和模型诊断提供了一个实用工具，能够可靠地检测和量化数据集中的概念偏差。

Abstract: Dataset bias, where data points are skewed to certain concepts, is ubiquitous
in machine learning datasets. Yet, systematically identifying these biases is
challenging without costly, fine-grained attribute annotations. We present
ConceptScope, a scalable and automated framework for analyzing visual datasets
by discovering and quantifying human-interpretable concepts using Sparse
Autoencoders trained on representations from vision foundation models.
ConceptScope categorizes concepts into target, context, and bias types based on
their semantic relevance and statistical correlation to class labels, enabling
class-level dataset characterization, bias identification, and robustness
evaluation through concept-based subgrouping. We validate that ConceptScope
captures a wide range of visual concepts, including objects, textures,
backgrounds, facial attributes, emotions, and actions, through comparisons with
annotated datasets. Furthermore, we show that concept activations produce
spatial attributions that align with semantically meaningful image regions.
ConceptScope reliably detects known biases (e.g., background bias in
Waterbirds) and uncovers previously unannotated ones (e.g, co-occurring objects
in ImageNet), offering a practical tool for dataset auditing and model
diagnostics.

Abstract: 3D human pose estimation from sketches has broad applications in computer
animation and film production. Unlike traditional human pose estimation, this
task presents unique challenges due to the abstract and disproportionate nature
of sketches. Previous sketch-to-pose methods, constrained by the lack of
large-scale sketch-3D pose annotations, primarily relied on optimization with
heuristic rules-an approach that is both time-consuming and limited in
generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach
leveraging a "learn from synthesis" strategy. First, a diffusion model is
trained to synthesize sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human
poses, mimicking disproportionate human structures in sketches. This process
enables the creation of a synthetic dataset, SKEP-120K, consisting of 120k
accurate sketch-3D pose annotation pairs across various sketch styles. Building
on this synthetic dataset, we introduce an end-to-end data-driven framework for
estimating human poses and shapes from diverse sketch styles. Our framework
combines existing 2D pose detectors and generative diffusion priors for sketch
feature extraction with a feed-forward neural network for efficient 2D pose
estimation. Multiple heuristic loss functions are incorporated to guarantee
geometric coherence between the derived 3D poses and the detected 2D poses
while preserving accurate self-contacts. Qualitative, quantitative, and
subjective evaluations collectively show that our model substantially surpasses
previous ones in both estimation accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks.

Abstract: The sustainability of supply chain plays a key role in achieving optimal
performance in controlling the supply chain. The management of risks that occur
in a supply chain is a fundamental problem for the purpose of developing the
sustainability of the network and elevating the performance efficiency of the
supply chain. The correct classification of products is another essential
element in a sustainable supply chain. Acknowledging recent breakthroughs in
the context of deep networks, several architectural options have been deployed
to analyze supply chain datasets. A novel geometric deep network is used to
propose an ensemble deep network. The proposed Chebyshev ensemble geometric
network (Ch-EGN) is a hybrid convolutional and geometric deep learning. This
network is proposed to leverage the information dependencies in supply chain to
derive invisible states of samples in the database. The functionality of the
proposed deep network is assessed on the two different databases. The
SupplyGraph Dataset and DataCo are considered in this research. The prediction
of delivery status of DataCo supply chain is done for risk administration. The
product classification and edge classification are performed using the
SupplyGraph database to enhance the sustainability of the supply network. An
average accuracy of 98.95% is obtained for the ensemble network for risk
management. The average accuracy of 100% and 98.07% are obtained for
sustainable supply chain in terms of 5 product group classification and 4
product relation classification, respectively. The average accuracy of 92.37%
is attained for 25 company relation classification. The results confirm an
average improvement and efficiency of the proposed method compared to the
state-of-the-art approaches.

*Hengrui Kang,Zhuangcheng Gu,Zhiyuan Zhao,Zichen Wen,Bin Wang,Weijia Li,Conghui He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了OmniLayout-1M数据集和OmniLayout-LLM模型，解决了文档布局生成领域数据稀缺和现有方法在复杂领域表现不佳的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文档AI研究主要集中在文档布局分析，而文档布局生成领域研究不足，主要障碍是缺乏多样化的布局数据，现有数据集主要包含学术论文的曼哈顿式结构，报纸、杂志等开放世界文档类型严重不足。

Method: 构建了百万规模的OmniLayout-1M数据集，包含六种常见文档类型；提出了OmniLayout-LLM模型，采用两阶段粗到细学习范式：1）从OmniLayout-1M学习通用布局原则，2）将知识迁移到特定领域进行细粒度学习。

Result: 在M$^{6}$Doc数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在多个领域都取得了强劲性能，显著超越了现有的布局生成专家模型和几个最新的通用大语言模型。

Conclusion: OmniLayout-1M数据集和OmniLayout-LLM模型有效解决了文档布局生成领域的数据稀缺和模型性能问题，代码、模型和数据集将公开发布。

Abstract: Document AI has advanced rapidly and is attracting increasing attention. Yet,
while most efforts have focused on document layout analysis (DLA), its
generative counterpart, document layout generation, remains underexplored. A
major obstacle lies in the scarcity of diverse layouts: academic papers with
Manhattan-style structures dominate existing studies, while open-world genres
such as newspapers and magazines remain severely underrepresented. To address
this gap, we curate OmniLayout-1M, the first million-scale dataset of diverse
document layouts, covering six common document types and comprising
contemporary layouts collected from multiple sources. Moreover, since existing
methods struggle in complex domains and often fail to arrange long sequences
coherently, we introduce OmniLayout-LLM, a 0.5B model with designed two-stage
Coarse-to-Fine learning paradigm: 1) learning universal layout principles from
OmniLayout-1M with coarse category definitions, and 2) transferring the
knowledge to a specific domain with fine-grained annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on
multiple domains in M$^{6}$Doc dataset, substantially surpassing both existing
layout generation experts and several latest general-purpose LLMs. Our code,
models, and dataset will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了AoT-PsyPhyBENCH基准，用于测试视觉语言模型在判断视频时间方向（前进或后退）方面的能力，发现大多数模型表现接近随机猜测，远低于人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在多模态任务上表现出色，但其对视频中时间信息的理解能力较弱且缺乏充分评估。作者希望通过判断时间方向这一简单但具有揭示性的挑战来探究这一差距。

Method: 引入AoT-PsyPhyBENCH基准，使用与人类行为研究相同的刺激物和行为基线，全面评估开源和专有、推理和非推理的视觉语言模型。

Result: 大多数模型在物理不可逆过程（如自由落体、扩散/爆炸）和因果手动动作（除法/加法）上的表现接近随机水平，即使最佳模型也远低于人类准确率。

Conclusion: 当前多模态系统存在根本性差距：虽然能捕捉丰富的视觉语义关联，但缺乏时间连续性和因果理解所需的归纳偏差。

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet
their grasp of temporal information in video remains weak and, crucially,
under-evaluated. We probe this gap with a deceptively simple but revealing
challenge: judging the arrow of time (AoT)-whether a short clip is played
forward or backward. We introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated
benchmark that tests whether VLMs can infer temporal direction in natural
videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans.
Our comprehensive evaluation of open-weight and proprietary, reasoning and
non-reasoning VLMs reveals that most models perform near chance, and even the
best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (e.g.,
free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition)
that humans recognize almost instantly. These results highlight a fundamental
gap in current multimodal systems: while they capture rich visual-semantic
correlations, they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity
and causal understanding. We release the code and data for AoT-PsyPhyBENCH to
encourage further progress in the physical and temporal reasoning capabilities
of VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有融合方法难以平衡模态信息，生成式方法生成能力有限且缺乏可解释性，影响复杂场景下融合结果的可靠性和一致性。

Method: 设计多尺度掩码调控变分瓶颈编码器进行后验概率建模和信息分解，结合扩散模型的概率生成能力与时变物理引导机制自适应调控生成过程。

Result: 在多个数据集上的定性和定量评估中达到最先进的融合性能，显著提升语义分割指标。

Conclusion: 基于人类认知启发的生成式图像融合方法在增强结构一致性和细节质量方面具有优势。

Abstract: Existing infrared and visible image fusion methods often face the dilemma of
balancing modal information. Generative fusion methods reconstruct fused images
by learning from data distributions, but their generative capabilities remain
limited. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in modal information selection
further affects the reliability and consistency of fusion results in complex
scenarios. This manuscript revisits the essence of generative image fusion
under the inspiration of human cognitive laws and proposes a novel infrared and
visible image fusion method, termed HCLFuse. First, HCLFuse investigates the
quantification theory of information mapping in unsupervised fusion networks,
which leads to the design of a multi-scale mask-regulated variational
bottleneck encoder. This encoder applies posterior probability modeling and
information decomposition to extract accurate and concise low-level modal
information, thereby supporting the generation of high-fidelity structural
details. Furthermore, the probabilistic generative capability of the diffusion
model is integrated with physical laws, forming a time-varying physical
guidance mechanism that adaptively regulates the generation process at
different stages, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to perceive the
intrinsic structure of data and reducing dependence on data quality.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
fusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple
datasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics. This fully
demonstrates the advantages of this generative image fusion method, drawing
inspiration from human cognition, in enhancing structural consistency and
detail quality.

Motivation: 研究不同复杂度的CNN在虹膜验证任务中的互补性，特别是在不同距离下的性能表现。

Method: 在VGGFace2的大规模眼部图像上训练三种CNN架构，使用余弦和chi2度量分析性能，比较不同网络初始化，并通过逻辑回归进行分数级融合。使用LIME热图和Jensen-Shannon散度比较CNN的注意力模式。

Result: ResNet50单独表现最佳，但三种网络的融合提供了显著性能提升。热图显示不同网络关注图像的不同区域，解释了它们的互补性。该方法在UBIPr数据库上显著优于先前工作。

Conclusion: 不同CNN架构在虹膜验证中具有互补性，网络融合策略能够显著提升性能，实现了新的最先进结果。

Abstract: We study the complementarity of different CNNs for periocular verification at
different distances on the UBIPr database. We train three architectures of
increasing complexity (SqueezeNet, MobileNetv2, and ResNet50) on a large set of
eye crops from VGGFace2. We analyse performance with cosine and chi2 metrics,
compare different network initialisations, and apply score-level fusion via
logistic regression. In addition, we use LIME heatmaps and Jensen-Shannon
divergence to compare attention patterns of the CNNs. While ResNet50
consistently performs best individually, the fusion provides substantial gains,
especially when combining all three networks. Heatmaps show that networks
usually focus on distinct regions of a given image, which explains their
complementarity. Our method significantly outperforms previous works on UBIPr,
achieving a new state-of-the-art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模仿学习方法存在模式崩溃问题，无法生成多样轨迹假设；而生成方法难以在生成过程中直接整合安全约束，需要额外优化阶段。

Method: 利用约束流匹配建模流匹配过程，在流匹配过程中直接施加显式约束，确保轨迹符合安全规则；参数化驾驶攻击性作为控制信号。

Result: 在NavSim v2挑战赛中获得第二名，EPDMS得分为51.31，并获得创新奖。

Conclusion: CATG通过约束流匹配有效解决了模式崩溃问题，能够生成符合安全约束的多样化轨迹，并实现驾驶风格的精确控制。

Abstract: Planning is a critical component of end-to-end autonomous driving. However,
prevailing imitation learning methods often suffer from mode collapse, failing
to produce diverse trajectory hypotheses. Meanwhile, existing generative
approaches struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints
directly into the generative process, necessitating an additional optimization
stage to refine their outputs. To address these limitations, we propose CATG, a
novel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely,
CATG explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates
mode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning
signals. Our primary contribution is the novel imposition of explicit
constraints directly within the flow matching process, ensuring that the
generated trajectories adhere to vital safety and kinematic rules. Secondly,
CATG parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during
generation, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style. Notably, on the
NavSim v2 challenge, CATG achieved 2nd place with an EPDMS score of 51.31 and
was honored with the Innovation Award.

TL;DR: 本文评估了三种不同深度和复杂度的卷积神经网络在眼周生物识别中的效果，使用大规模VGGFace2数据库进行训练，在UFPR-Periocular数据集上取得了1-2%的等错误率，是目前该数据集上报告的最低错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 眼周区域具有高区分性和最小采集约束的优势，但现有研究通常依赖小规模数据集进行训练，本文旨在利用大规模数据集评估CNN架构在眼周识别中的有效性。

Method: 使用三种不同深度和复杂度的CNN架构，在包含1,907,572个眼部裁剪图像的大规模VGGFace2数据库上进行训练，并在VGGFace2-Pose和UFPR-Periocular两个数据集上进行实验评估。

Result: 在VGGFace2-Pose数据集上，眼部裁剪图像的等错误率为9-15%，显著高于全脸图像的3-6%；而在UFPR-Periocular数据集上取得了1-2%的等错误率，是目前该数据集上报告的最佳性能。

Conclusion: 眼周生物识别在大规模训练数据下表现良好，特别是在高质量图像和一致采集协议下，UFPR-Periocular数据集上的优异表现证明了眼周区域作为生物识别特征的潜力。

Abstract: We focus on ocular biometrics, specifically the periocular region (the area
around the eye), which offers high discrimination and minimal acquisition
constraints. We evaluate three Convolutional Neural Network architectures of
varying depth and complexity to assess their effectiveness for periocular
recognition. The networks are trained on 1,907,572 ocular crops extracted from
the large-scale VGGFace2 database. This significantly contrasts with existing
works, which typically rely on small-scale periocular datasets for training
having only a few thousand images. Experiments are conducted with ocular images
from VGGFace2-Pose, a subset of VGGFace2 containing in-the-wild face images,
and the UFPR-Periocular database, which consists of selfies captured via mobile
devices with user guidance on the screen. Due to the uncontrolled conditions of
VGGFace2, the Equal Error Rates (EERs) obtained with ocular crops range from
9-15%, noticeably higher than the 3-6% EERs achieved using full-face images. In
contrast, UFPR-Periocular yields significantly better performance (EERs of
1-2%), thanks to higher image quality and more consistent acquisition
protocols. To the best of our knowledge, these are the lowest reported EERs on
the UFPR dataset to date.

Conclusion: 该工作为敏捷地球观测卫星星座调度提供了首个大规模基准套件和有效的深度学习解决方案，推动了该领域的现实应用。

Abstract: Agile Earth Observation Satellites (AEOSs) constellations offer unprecedented
flexibility for monitoring the Earth's surface, but their scheduling remains
challenging under large-scale scenarios, dynamic environments, and stringent
constraints. Existing methods often simplify these complexities, limiting their
real-world performance. We address this gap with a unified framework
integrating a standardized benchmark suite and a novel scheduling model. Our
benchmark suite, AEOS-Bench, contains $3,907$ finely tuned satellite assets and
$16,410$ scenarios. Each scenario features $1$ to $50$ satellites and $50$ to
$300$ imaging tasks. These scenarios are generated via a high-fidelity
simulation platform, ensuring realistic satellite behavior such as orbital
dynamics and resource constraints. Ground truth scheduling annotations are
provided for each scenario. To our knowledge, AEOS-Bench is the first
large-scale benchmark suite tailored for realistic constellation scheduling.
Building upon this benchmark, we introduce AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based
scheduling model that incorporates a constraint-aware attention mechanism. A
dedicated internal constraint module explicitly models the physical and
operational limits of each satellite. Through simulation-based iterative
learning, AEOS-Former adapts to diverse scenarios, offering a robust solution
for AEOS constellation scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate that
AEOS-Former outperforms baseline models in task completion and energy
efficiency, with ablation studies highlighting the contribution of each
component. Code and data are provided in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病视网膜病变是导致中老年人视力丧失的主要原因，现有基于单一CNN或ViT骨干网络的方法性能已达瓶颈，需要整合不同骨干网络的优势来进一步提升诊断性能。

Method: 通过一组深度证据网络将不同骨干网络提取的特征转换为支持证据，形成聚合意见，自适应调整不同骨干网络间的融合模式。

Conclusion: 基于证据理论的融合范式能有效整合CNN和ViT的优势，在提升DR诊断性能的同时提供良好的可解释性，为医学图像分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss among middle-aged
and elderly people, which significantly impacts their daily lives and mental
health. To improve the efficiency of clinical screening and enable the early
detection of DR, a variety of automated DR diagnosis systems have been recently
established based on convolutional neural network (CNN) or vision Transformer
(ViT). However, due to the own shortages of CNN / ViT, the performance of
existing methods using single-type backbone has reached a bottleneck. One
potential way for the further improvements is integrating different kinds of
backbones, which can fully leverage the respective strengths of them
(\emph{i.e.,} the local feature extraction capability of CNN and the global
feature capturing ability of ViT). To this end, we propose a novel paradigm to
effectively fuse the features extracted by different backbones based on the
theory of evidence. Specifically, the proposed evidential fusion paradigm
transforms the features from different backbones into supporting evidences via
a set of deep evidential networks. With the supporting evidences, the
aggregated opinion can be accordingly formed, which can be used to adaptively
tune the fusion pattern between different backbones and accordingly boost the
performance of our hybrid model. We evaluated our method on two publicly
available DR grading datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our
hybrid model not only improves the accuracy of DR grading, compared to the
state-of-the-art frameworks, but also provides the excellent interpretability
for feature fusion and decision-making.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLYPH-SR是一个视觉语言引导的扩散框架，专门针对场景文本超分辨率，同时优化文本可读性和感知质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超分辨率方法主要关注失真度或感知指标，但对字符级错误不敏感，导致场景文本（如标志、产品标签等）在OCR识别中失败。

Method: 使用基于OCR数据的文本超分辨率融合控制网络(TS-ControlNet)和乒乓调度器，在合成语料库上训练，同时保持主要超分辨率分支冻结。

Result: 在SVT、SCUT-CTW1500和CUTE80数据集上，4倍和8倍超分辨率下，GLYPH-SR相比基线方法将OCR F1分数提高了最多15.18个百分点，同时保持竞争力的感知质量指标。

Conclusion: GLYPH-SR能够同时实现高可读性和高视觉真实感，提供既好看又易读的超分辨率结果。

Abstract: Image super-resolution(SR) is fundamental to many vision system-from
surveillance and autonomy to document analysis and retail analytics-because
recovering high-frequency details, especially scene-text, enables reliable
downstream perception. Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such
as signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable
information; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character
recognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image
appears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion
(PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that
are largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do
address text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,
overlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,
scene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in
practical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for
both text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a
vision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives
jointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by
OCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and
scene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these
components on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.
Across SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by
up to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR)
while maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ. GLYPH-SR is designed
to satisfy both objectives simultaneously-high readability and high visual
realism-delivering SR that looks right and reds right.

Motivation: 现有的EEG驱动图像重建方法往往忽视空间注意力机制，导致重建图像的保真度和语义连贯性受限。

Method: 采用双条件框架：1) 使用自适应思维映射器(ATM)提取EEG特征；2) 通过低秩适应(LoRA)微调Stable Diffusion 2.1；3) 引入ControlNet分支基于显着性图进行空间控制。

Result: 在THINGS-EEG数据集上评估，该方法在低层和高层图像特征质量上显著优于现有方法，同时与人类视觉注意力高度一致。

Conclusion: 注意力先验能够解决EEG的模糊性，实现高保真重建，在医学诊断和神经自适应接口中有应用前景，通过预训练扩散模型的高效适应推进了神经解码研究。

Abstract: Existing EEG-driven image reconstruction methods often overlook spatial
attention mechanisms, limiting fidelity and semantic coherence. To address
this, we propose a dual-conditioning framework that combines EEG embeddings
with spatial saliency maps to enhance image generation. Our approach leverages
the Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM) for EEG feature extraction and fine-tunes
Stable Diffusion 2.1 via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to align neural signals
with visual semantics, while a ControlNet branch conditions generation on
saliency maps for spatial control. Evaluated on THINGS-EEG, our method achieves
a significant improvement in the quality of low- and high-level image features
over existing approaches. Simultaneously, strongly aligning with human visual
attention. The results demonstrate that attentional priors resolve EEG
ambiguities, enabling high-fidelity reconstructions with applications in
medical diagnostics and neuroadaptive interfaces, advancing neural decoding
through efficient adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models.

TL;DR: 提出了LoCoT2V-Bench基准，专门用于评估复杂输入条件下的长视频生成，包含多维度评估框架和新指标，发现现有方法在事件间一致性、细粒度对齐和高级主题遵循方面存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成评估基准主要依赖简化提示和低层次指标，忽视了与提示的细粒度对齐以及叙事连贯性、主题表达等抽象维度，无法有效评估长视频生成。

Method: 基于真实世界视频构建包含场景转换和事件动态的现实复杂提示集，建立多维度评估框架，包括事件级对齐、细粒度时间一致性、内容清晰度和人类期望实现度等新指标。

Result: 对9个代表性长视频生成模型的评估显示，当前方法在基本视觉和时间方面表现良好，但在事件间一致性、细粒度对齐和高级主题遵循等方面存在困难。

Conclusion: LoCoT2V-Bench为长文本到视频生成提供了全面可靠的评估平台，指明了未来方法改进的关键方向。

Abstract: Recently text-to-video generation has made impressive progress in producing
short, high-quality clips, but evaluating long-form outputs remains a major
challenge especially when processing complex prompts. Existing benchmarks
mostly rely on simplified prompts and focus on low-level metrics, overlooking
fine-grained alignment with prompts and abstract dimensions such as narrative
coherence and thematic expression. To address these gaps, we propose
LoCoT2V-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for long video generation
(LVG) under complex input conditions. Based on various real-world videos,
LoCoT2V-Bench introduces a suite of realistic and complex prompts incorporating
elements like scene transitions and event dynamics. Moreover, it constructs a
multi-dimensional evaluation framework that includes our newly proposed metrics
such as event-level alignment, fine-grained temporal consistency, content
clarity, and the Human Expectation Realization Degree (HERD) that focuses on
more abstract attributes like narrative flow, emotional response, and character
development. Using this framework, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
nine representative LVG models, finding that while current methods perform well
on basic visual and temporal aspects, they struggle with inter-event
consistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence, etc.
Overall, LoCoT2V-Bench provides a comprehensive and reliable platform for
evaluating long-form complex text-to-video generation and highlights critical
directions for future method improvement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了A-TPT框架，通过引入角度多样性来改善视觉语言模型在测试时提示调优中的校准性能，通过最大化单位超球面上特征间的最小成对角度距离来实现文本特征的均匀分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时提示调优方法在文本特征分散性方面存在不足，导致校准性能不佳，这影响了视觉语言模型的可靠性、可信度和安全性。现有方法主要关注最大化平均文本特征分散性或施加正交约束，但可能无法实现最优的角度分离。

Method: 提出A-TPT框架，通过最大化单位超球面上归一化文本特征之间的最小成对角度距离来鼓励角度多样性，从而实现学习提示诱导的文本特征的均匀分布。

Result: 在各种骨干网络和数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在降低聚合平均校准误差方面持续优于最先进的TPT方法，同时保持相当的准确性。在自然分布偏移上表现出优越的零样本校准性能，并能很好地泛化到医学数据集。

Conclusion: 促进角度多样性是实现良好分散文本特征的有效方法，能显著改善视觉语言模型在测试时适应过程中的校准性能。

Abstract: Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) has emerged as a promising technique for
adapting large vision-language models (VLMs) to unseen tasks without relying on
labeled data. However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt
calibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability,
trustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on
improving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature
dispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular
separation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular
separation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the
critical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel
TPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the
distribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable
prompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular
distance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate
average calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through
extensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets. Notably,
our approach exhibits superior zero-shot calibration performance on natural
distribution shifts and generalizes well to medical datasets. We provide
extensive analyses, including theoretical aspects, to establish the grounding
of A-TPT. These results highlight the potency of promoting angular diversity to
achieve well-dispersed textual features, significantly improving VLM
calibration during test-time adaptation. Our code will be made publicly
available.

*Rhodri Guerrier,Adam W. Harley,Dima Damen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出PointSt3R方法，通过3D基础对应关系将基础3D重建模型（如DUSt3R和MASt3R）适配用于点跟踪任务，在多个数据集上取得竞争性或更优的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础3D重建模型在静态场景中已展现出2D和3D对应的潜力，但需要将其适配用于动态点跟踪任务，特别是在仅使用帧对且无时间上下文的情况下。

Method: 结合重建损失与动态对应训练，添加可见性头，使用少量合成数据对MASt3R进行微调，仅使用包含查询点的帧对进行训练和评估。

Result: 在四个数据集上取得竞争性或更优结果：TAP-Vid-DAVIS上73.8 δ_avg/85.8%遮挡准确率（CoTracker2为75.7/88.3%），EgoPoints上61.3 vs 54.2，RGB-S上87.0 vs 82.8，显著优于CoTracker3。

Conclusion: PointSt3R方法成功将基础3D重建模型适配用于点跟踪任务，在仅使用帧对的情况下实现了竞争性的性能，证明了3D基础对应关系在点跟踪中的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundational 3D reconstruction models, such as DUSt3R and
MASt3R, have shown great potential in 2D and 3D correspondence in static
scenes. In this paper, we propose to adapt them for the task of point tracking
through 3D grounded correspondence. We first demonstrate that these models are
competitive point trackers when focusing on static points, present in current
point tracking benchmarks ($+33.5\%$ on EgoPoints vs. CoTracker2). We propose
to combine the reconstruction loss with training for dynamic correspondence
along with a visibility head, and fine-tuning MASt3R for point tracking using a
relatively small amount of synthetic data. Importantly, we only train and
evaluate on pairs of frames where one contains the query point, effectively
removing any temporal context. Using a mix of dynamic and static point
correspondences, we achieve competitive or superior point tracking results on
four datasets (e.g. competitive on TAP-Vid-DAVIS 73.8 $\delta_{avg}$ / 85.8\%
occlusion acc. for PointSt3R compared to 75.7 / 88.3\% for CoTracker2; and
significantly outperform CoTracker3 on EgoPoints 61.3 vs 54.2 and RGB-S 87.0 vs
82.8). We also present results on 3D point tracking along with several
ablations on training datasets and percentage of dynamic correspondences.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了FineGrainedAD框架，通过多级细粒度语义描述来解决少样本异常检测中的语义对齐问题，提升异常定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法由于缺乏详细文本描述，只能预定义图像级描述来匹配视觉补丁，导致图像描述与补丁级视觉异常之间的语义错位，定位性能不佳。

Method: 提出多级细粒度语义描述(MFSC)自动构建管道，包含多级可学习提示(MLLP)和多级语义对齐(MLSA)两个组件。MLLP通过自动替换和连接机制将细粒度语义引入多级可学习提示，MLSA设计区域聚合策略和多级对齐训练。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集的少样本设置中实现了优异的整体性能。

Conclusion: FineGrainedAD通过多级细粒度语义描述有效解决了语义对齐问题，显著提升了异常定位性能。

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) methods identify anomalous regions with few
known normal samples. Most existing methods rely on the generalization ability
of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to recognize potentially anomalous
regions through feature similarity between text descriptions and images.
However, due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions, these methods can
only pre-define image-level descriptions to match each visual patch token to
identify potential anomalous regions, which leads to the semantic misalignment
between image descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies, achieving
sub-optimal localization performance. To address the above issues, we propose
the Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) to provide multi-level and
fine-grained textual descriptions for existing anomaly detection datasets with
automatic construction pipeline. Based on the MFSC, we propose a novel
framework named FineGrainedAD to improve anomaly localization performance,
which consists of two components: Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and
Multi-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA). MLLP introduces fine-grained semantics
into multi-level learnable prompts through automatic replacement and
concatenation mechanism, while MLSA designs region aggregation strategy and
multi-level alignment training to facilitate learnable prompts better align
with corresponding visual regions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
FineGrainedAD achieves superior overall performance in few-shot settings on
MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型中存在对象-上下文捷径问题，当测试场景与训练共现模式不同时，会削弱零样本可靠性。作者将其重新定义为因果推理问题。

Method: 在CLIP表示空间中估计对象和背景期望，通过从外部数据集、批次邻居或文本描述中采样不同上下文，合成反事实嵌入。使用总直接效应估计和干预模拟，减去仅背景激活。

Result: 无需重新训练或提示设计，该方法在上下文敏感基准测试中显著提高了最差组和平均准确率，建立了新的零样本最优性能。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种轻量级的表示级反事实方法，为去偏和可靠的多模态推理提供了实用的因果途径。

Abstract: Object-context shortcuts remain a persistent challenge in vision-language
models, undermining zero-shot reliability when test-time scenes differ from
familiar training co-occurrences. We recast this issue as a causal inference
problem and ask: Would the prediction remain if the object appeared in a
different environment? To answer this at inference time, we estimate object and
background expectations within CLIP's representation space, and synthesize
counterfactual embeddings by recombining object features with diverse
alternative contexts sampled from external datasets, batch neighbors, or
text-derived descriptions. By estimating the Total Direct Effect and simulating
intervention, we further subtract background-only activation, preserving
beneficial object-context interactions while mitigating hallucinated scores.
Without retraining or prompt design, our method substantially improves both
worst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks, establishing
a new zero-shot state of the art. Beyond performance, our framework provides a
lightweight representation-level counterfactual approach, offering a practical
causal avenue for debiased and reliable multimodal reasoning.

Result: 在Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct和InternVL2.5-4B模型上的广泛实验表明，该方法在视觉推理任务上持续提升能力，平均比普通自改进方法高出3.86分。

Conclusion: 通过头尾重新平衡策略，可以有效缓解自改进过程中的马太效应，突破性能瓶颈，持续提升模型的视觉推理能力。

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models
explore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we
identify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating
high-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles
with more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced
optimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while
hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,
this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the "Matthew
effect"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to
performance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four
efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and
trajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the
exploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on
Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks
demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning
capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.

Abstract: The edge detection task is essential in image processing aiming to extract
relevant information from an image. One recurring problem in this task is the
weaknesses found in some detectors, such as the difficulty in detecting loose
edges and the lack of context to extract relevant information from specific
problems. To address these weaknesses and adapt the detector to the properties
of an image, an adaptable detector described by two-dimensional cellular
automaton and optimized by meta-heuristic combined with transfer learning
techniques was developed. This study aims to analyze the impact of expanding
the search space of the optimization phase and the robustness of the
adaptability of the detector in identifying edges of a set of natural images
and specialized subsets extracted from the same image set. The results obtained
prove that expanding the search space of the optimization phase was not
effective for the chosen image set. The study also analyzed the adaptability of
the model through a series of experiments and validation techniques and found
that, regardless of the validation, the model was able to adapt to the input
and the transfer learning techniques applied to the model showed no significant
improvements.

Conclusion: SA²Net作为一种有前景的工具，在智能脊柱图像分析中具有推进脊柱侧弯诊断的潜力。

Abstract: Spine segmentation, based on ultrasound volume projection imaging (VPI),
plays a vital role for intelligent scoliosis diagnosis in clinical
applications. However, this task faces several significant challenges. Firstly,
the global contextual knowledge of spines may not be well-learned if we neglect
the high spatial correlation of different bone features. Secondly, the spine
bones contain rich structural knowledge regarding their shapes and positions,
which deserves to be encoded into the segmentation process. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network
(SA$^{2}$Net) for effective spine segmentation. First, we propose a
scale-adaptive complementary strategy to learn the cross-dimensional
long-distance correlation features for spinal images. Second, motivated by the
consistency between multi-head self-attention in Transformers and semantic
level affinity, we propose structure-affinity transformation to transform
semantic features with class-specific affinity and combine it with a
Transformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning. In addition, we adopt a
feature mixing loss aggregation method to enhance model training. This method
improves the robustness and accuracy of the segmentation process. The
experimental results demonstrate that our SA$^{2}$Net achieves superior
segmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover,
the adaptability of SA$^{2}$Net to various backbones enhances its potential as
a promising tool for advanced scoliosis diagnosis using intelligent spinal
image analysis. The code and experimental demo are available at

Conclusion: 该框架成功地将视频剪辑作为广告特定的镜头选择问题，并通过音视频融合模型显著提升了自动化广告剪辑的性能。

Abstract: Advertisers commonly need multiple versions of the same advertisement (ad) at
varying durations for a single campaign. The traditional approach involves
manually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter
versions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we
introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization
techniques. We are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection
problem, tailored specifically for advertising. Unlike existing general video
summarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach
emphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we
develop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of
video frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being
selected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific
datasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of
30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various metrics, including Average Precision, Area Under Curve,
Spearman, and Kendall.

Abstract: In real-world environments, AI systems often face unfamiliar scenarios
without labeled data, creating a major challenge for conventional scene
understanding models. The inability to generalize across unseen contexts limits
the deployment of vision-based applications in dynamic, unstructured settings.
This work introduces a Dynamic Context-Aware Scene Reasoning framework that
leverages Vision-Language Alignment to address zero-shot real-world scenarios.
The goal is to enable intelligent systems to infer and adapt to new
environments without prior task-specific training. The proposed approach
integrates pre-trained vision transformers and large language models to align
visual semantics with natural language descriptions, enhancing contextual
comprehension. A dynamic reasoning module refines predictions by combining
global scene cues and object-level interactions guided by linguistic priors.
Extensive experiments on zero-shot benchmarks such as COCO, Visual Genome, and
Open Images demonstrate up to 18% improvement in scene understanding accuracy
over baseline models in complex and unseen environments. Results also show
robust performance in ambiguous or cluttered scenes due to the synergistic
fusion of vision and language. This framework offers a scalable and
interpretable approach for context-aware reasoning, advancing zero-shot
generalization in dynamic real-world settings.

TL;DR: CATCH是一个即插即用的跨域适应框架，通过解耦视觉和语言适应，使用轻量级域分类器和双适配器机制，在不重新训练主干模型的情况下提升VQA模型在跨域场景中的泛化能力。

Motivation: 现有VQA模型在自然图像领域表现优异，但在遥感、医疗影像、数学图表等跨域场景中泛化能力显著下降。传统方法依赖按域微调或定制化流程，成本高、灵活性差且难以扩展到多样化任务。

Method: 提出CATCH框架，引入两个轻量级模块：域分类器识别输入图像类型，双适配器机制包括用于语言调制的提示适配器和用于视觉特征调整的视觉适配器。两个模块通过统一钩子接口动态注入，无需重新训练主干模型。

Result: 在四个域特定VQA基准测试中，CATCH框架在不重新训练主干模型的情况下实现了持续性能提升：MathVQA上BLEU提升2.3，MedVQA-RAD上VQA得分提升2.6，ChartQA上ROUGE提升3.1。

Conclusion: CATCH为多域VQA提供了可扩展和可扩展的方法，能够在不同应用领域中实现实际部署，显著提升了跨域场景下的模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated
impressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA
leveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However,
their generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain
scenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to
large distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation
mechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or
bespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across
diverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for
cross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while
requiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to
decouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight
modules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual
adapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a
Visual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically
injected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone
model. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without
retraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on
MedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH
provides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling
practical deployment across diverse application domains.

Abstract: We introduce Emu3.5, a large-scale multimodal world model that natively
predicts the next state across vision and language. Emu3.5 is pre-trained
end-to-end with a unified next-token prediction objective on a corpus of
vision-language interleaved data containing over 10 trillion tokens, primarily
derived from sequential frames and transcripts of internet videos. The model
naturally accepts interleaved vision-language inputs and generates interleaved
vision-language outputs. Emu3.5 is further post-trained with large-scale
reinforcement learning to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation. To
improve inference efficiency, we propose Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA),
which converts token-by-token decoding into bidirectional parallel prediction,
accelerating per-image inference by about 20x without sacrificing performance.
Emu3.5 exhibits strong native multimodal capabilities, including long-horizon
vision-language generation, any-to-image (X2I) generation, and complex
text-rich image generation. It also exhibits generalizable world-modeling
abilities, enabling spatiotemporally consistent world exploration and
open-world embodied manipulation across diverse scenarios and tasks. For
comparison, Emu3.5 achieves performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image
(Nano Banana) on image generation and editing tasks and demonstrates superior
results on a suite of interleaved generation tasks. We open-source Emu3.5 at
https://github.com/baaivision/Emu3.5 to support community research.

Abstract: Computational Super-Resolution (CSR) in fluorescence microscopy has, despite
being an ill-posed problem, a long history. At its very core, CSR is about
finding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph
that have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to
reason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques,
stronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here,
we present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow
matching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4
diverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results
against 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results,
demonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and
perceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly
effective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given
low-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that
ResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior
distribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases,
enabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can
guide future users to reject uncertain predictions.

TL;DR: CYPRESS是一个基于预训练地理空间基础模型的深度学习系统，用于高分辨率、像素级的油菜籽产量预测，在加拿大草原地区数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统作物产量预测方法缺乏可扩展性和精细度，无法满足精准农业的需求。需要开发能够提供高分辨率、连续产量预测的工具来支持现代农业管理。

Method: 利用预训练的大规模地理空间基础模型Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M，通过微调适应连续回归任务，将多时相卫星图像转换为密集的像素级产量图。

Result: 在加拿大草原地区综合数据集上的评估表明，CYPRESS在油菜籽产量预测方面优于现有的基于深度学习的产量预测模型。

Abstract: Accurate and timely crop yield prediction is crucial for global food security
and modern agricultural management. Traditional methods often lack the
scalability and granularity required for precision farming. This paper
introduces CYPRESS (Crop Yield Prediction via Regression on Prithvi's Encoder
for Satellite Sensing), a deep learning model designed for high-resolution,
intra-field canola yield prediction. CYPRESS leverages a pre-trained,
large-scale geospatial foundation model (Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M) and adapts it for
a continuous regression task, transforming multi-temporal satellite imagery
into dense, pixel-level yield maps. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from
the Canadian Prairies, CYPRESS demonstrates superior performance over existing
deep learning-based yield prediction models, highlighting the effectiveness of
fine-tuning foundation models for specialized agricultural applications. By
providing a continuous, high-resolution output, CYPRESS offers a more
actionable tool for precision agriculture than conventional classification or
county-level aggregation methods. This work validates a novel approach that
bridges the gap between large-scale Earth observation and on-farm
decision-making, offering a scalable solution for detailed agricultural
monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了专门为事件相机设计的Spiking Patches标记化方法，能够保持事件的异步性和空间稀疏性，在保持精度的同时显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事件表示方法（帧或体素）虽然精度高，但破坏了事件相机的异步性和空间稀疏性特性，需要一种能保持这些独特属性的新表示方法。

Method: 提出Spiking Patches标记化方法，将异步稀疏事件流转换为标记表示，并在手势识别和物体检测任务中评估了GNN、PCN和Transformer等模型。

Result: Spiking Patches标记比基于体素的标记推理速度快3.4倍，比帧快10.4倍，同时精度相当甚至在某些情况下有所提升（手势识别提升3.8%，物体检测提升1.4%）。

Conclusion: 标记化为事件视觉提供了新方向，是朝着保持事件相机特性方法的重要一步。

Abstract: We propose tokenization of events and present a tokenizer, Spiking Patches,
specifically designed for event cameras. Given a stream of asynchronous and
spatially sparse events, our goal is to discover an event representation that
preserves these properties. Prior works have represented events as frames or as
voxels. However, while these representations yield high accuracy, both frames
and voxels are synchronous and decrease the spatial sparsity. Spiking Patches
gives the means to preserve the unique properties of event cameras and we show
in our experiments that this comes without sacrificing accuracy. We evaluate
our tokenizer using a GNN, PCN, and a Transformer on gesture recognition and
object detection. Tokens from Spiking Patches yield inference times that are up
to 3.4x faster than voxel-based tokens and up to 10.4x faster than frames. We
achieve this while matching their accuracy and even surpassing in some cases
with absolute improvements up to 3.8 for gesture recognition and up to 1.4 for
object detection. Thus, tokenization constitutes a novel direction in
event-based vision and marks a step towards methods that preserve the
properties of event cameras.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are transforming the future of transportation
through advances in intelligent perception, decision-making, and control
systems. However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object
detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in
Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable
progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains
fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative
intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking
analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI
rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically
reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR,
and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their
capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their
potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception
frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that
moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based,
and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a
cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze
cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to
hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven
approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language
Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey
delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future
opportunities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 首次大规模评估48个深度学习光流模型在RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR海冰影像上的性能，多个模型达到亚公里级精度，证明深度学习光流方法可有效应用于极地遥感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计海冰漂移对北极航行、气候研究和业务预报至关重要。虽然光流技术在计算机视觉中发展迅速，但其在地球物理问题和卫星SAR影像中的应用仍待探索。

Method: 使用48个深度学习光流模型处理RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR海冰影像，通过端点误差(EPE)和Fl指标与GNSS跟踪浮标进行对比评估。

Result: 多个模型达到亚公里级精度(EPE 6-8像素，300-400米)，相对于海冰运动空间尺度和北极典型导航需求来说误差较小。模型能够捕捉一致的区域漂移模式。

Conclusion: 深度学习光流方法相比传统方法显著提高了运动估计精度，可有效转移到极地遥感应用，提供空间连续漂移场，为导航和气候建模提供新机遇。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of sea ice drift is critical for Arctic navigation,
climate research, and operational forecasting. While optical flow, a computer
vision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images,
has advanced rapidly in computer vision, its applicability to geophysical
problems and to satellite SAR imagery remains underexplored. Classical optical
flow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion,
which limit their accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent deep learning based
approaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard in
computer vision, motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation. We
present the first large scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models
on RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and
Fl all metrics against GNSS tracked buoys. Several models achieve sub kilometer
accuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to the
spatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the
Arctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing
consistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical
flow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy
compared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remote
sensing. Optical flow produces spatially continuous drift fields, providing
motion estimates for every image pixel rather than at sparse buoy locations,
offering new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling.

Motivation: 遮挡对目标识别算法构成重大挑战，场景上下文信息在生物视觉中已被证明有助于目标识别，因此希望通过融合场景信息来减少遮挡引起的错误。

Method: 提出了两种场景信息融合方法：1）预测前基于识别出的背景场景选择定制目标网络；2）检测后将场景知识融合到RPN输出的初始目标分数中。

Result: 在具有部分遮挡的挑战性数据集上，相比基线方法在召回率和精确度方面都有整体提升，实验还发现同时使用遮挡和非遮挡图像训练效果更好。

Conclusion: 该方法具有可解释性且易于适配其他数据集，为未来研究和实际应用提供了多个方向。

Abstract: The presence of occlusions has provided substantial challenges to
typically-powerful object recognition algorithms. Additional sources of
information can be extremely valuable to reduce errors caused by occlusions.
Scene context is known to aid in object recognition in biological vision. In
this work, we attempt to add robustness into existing Region Proposal
Network-Deep Convolutional Neural Network (RPN-DCNN) object detection networks
through two distinct scene-based information fusion techniques. We present one
algorithm under each methodology: the first operates prior to prediction,
selecting a custom object network to use based on the identified background
scene, and the second operates after detection, fusing scene knowledge into
initial object scores output by the RPN. We demonstrate our algorithms on
challenging datasets featuring partial occlusions, which show overall
improvement in both recall and precision against baseline methods. In addition,
our experiments contrast multiple training methodologies for occlusion
handling, finding that training on a combination of both occluded and
unoccluded images demonstrates an improvement over the others. Our method is
interpretable and can easily be adapted to other datasets, offering many future
directions for research and practical applications.

Conclusion: SteerVLM通过激活工程为多模态模型控制提供了稳健解决方案，并引入了VNIA数据集支持VLM控制技术的发展。

Abstract: This work introduces SteerVLM, a lightweight steering module designed to
guide Vision-Language Models (VLMs) towards outputs that better adhere to
desired instructions. Our approach learns from the latent embeddings of paired
prompts encoding target and converse behaviors to dynamically adjust
activations connecting the language modality with image context. This allows
for fine-grained, inference-time control over complex output semantics without
modifying model weights while preserving performance on off-target tasks. Our
steering module requires learning parameters equal to 0.14% of the original
VLM's size. Our steering module gains model control through dimension-wise
activation modulation and adaptive steering across layers without requiring
pre-extracted static vectors or manual tuning of intervention points.
Furthermore, we introduce VNIA (Visual Narrative Intent Alignment), a
multimodal dataset specifically created to facilitate the development and
evaluation of VLM steering techniques. Our method outperforms existing
intervention techniques on steering and hallucination mitigation benchmarks for
VLMs and proposes a robust solution for multimodal model control through
activation engineering.

Abstract: Charts play an important role in visualization, reasoning, data analysis, and
the exchange of ideas among humans. However, existing vision-language models
(VLMs) still lack accurate perception of details and struggle to extract
fine-grained structures from charts. Such limitations in chart grounding also
hinder their ability to compare multiple charts and reason over them. In this
paper, we introduce a novel "ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB)" to provide a
comprehensive evaluation of VLMs in chart grounding tasks, i.e., extracting
tabular data, localizing visualization elements, and recognizing various
attributes from charts of diverse types and complexities. We design a JSON
template to facilitate the calculation of evaluation metrics specifically
tailored for each grounding task. By incorporating a novel two-stage inference
workflow, the benchmark can further evaluate VLMs' capability to align and
compare elements/attributes across two charts. Our analysis of evaluations on
several recent VLMs reveals new insights into their perception biases,
weaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in chart understanding. These
findings highlight the fine-grained discrepancies among VLMs in chart
understanding tasks and point to specific skills that need to be strengthened
in current models.

Abstract: Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including
computer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise
from coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods
to model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic
hierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability
across different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion
modeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships
directly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based
hierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into
parent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy
inference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent
elemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies
through graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction
approach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and
dynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show
that our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,
and produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the
baseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,
data-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation
applicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks. Project Page:

Abstract: Despite recent advances in 3D human motion generation (MoGen) on standard
benchmarks, existing models still face a fundamental bottleneck in their
generalization capability. In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most
notably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization
in modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can
leverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework
that systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key
pillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a
large-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that
integrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions
from web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen
models. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion
triplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose
ViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from
MoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance
efficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that
eliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong
generalization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合方法，实现大洲尺度的细粒度地理定位，通过代理分类任务学习丰富特征表示，结合航空影像嵌入提高鲁棒性，在覆盖欧洲大部分地区的数据集上68%查询可定位在200米内。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全球尺度图像精确定位的挑战，现有方法要么效率低下，要么定位精度粗糙，需要在大地理范围内实现细粒度定位。

Method: 采用混合方法，训练时使用代理分类任务学习丰富特征表示，结合航空影像嵌入来增强对地面数据稀疏性的鲁棒性。

Result: 在覆盖欧洲大部分地区的数据集上，68%的查询能够定位在200米范围内，实现了大洲尺度的细粒度地理定位。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了大规模地理定位的精度与效率平衡问题，为全球尺度细粒度图像定位提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Determining the precise geographic location of an image at a global scale
remains an unsolved challenge. Standard image retrieval techniques are
inefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is
insufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global
classification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), while
cross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain
gap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces a
hybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large
geographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification
task during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly
encode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with
embeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of
ground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas
spanning multiple countries. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
approach can localize within 200m more than 68\% of queries of a dataset
covering a large part of Europe. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: SEE4D是一个无需姿态标注的视频到4D内容生成框架，通过虚拟相机渲染和视图条件视频修复模型，实现了从随意视频中合成时空4D内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频到4D方法依赖手动标注的相机姿态，成本高且对野外视频不鲁棒。基于扭曲-修复的方法虽然避免了姿态标注，但将相机运动与场景动态耦合，使建模和推理复杂化。

Method: 提出轨迹到相机框架，用固定虚拟相机渲染代替显式轨迹预测，将相机控制与场景建模分离。训练视图条件视频修复模型学习几何先验，通过时空自回归推理管道在虚拟相机样条上生成连贯内容。

Result: 在跨视图视频生成和稀疏重建基准测试中，SEE4D在定量指标和定性评估上都优于基于姿态或轨迹条件的基线方法。

Conclusion: SEE4D实现了从随意视频中实用的4D世界建模，无需显式3D标注，具有更好的泛化能力和性能表现。

Abstract: Immersive applications call for synthesizing spatiotemporal 4D content from
casual videos without costly 3D supervision. Existing video-to-4D methods
typically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive
and brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches
mitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera
trajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby
depicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this
trajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene
dynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a
pose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory
prediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby
separating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video
inpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising
realistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing
regions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D
annotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal
autoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and
extends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at
bounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation
and sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization and
improved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines,
advancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos.

*Chao Feng,Zihao Wei,Andrew Owens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为掩码扩散字幕（MDC）的方法，通过图像条件掩码扩散语言模型学习视觉特征，在多种学术规模模型和数据集上的线性探测实验表明，该方法产生的视觉特征与自回归和对比方法相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自回归字幕方法中视觉学习信号的强度依赖于标记在序列中的位置，需要辅助目标。MDC旨在减少对辅助目标的依赖，通过扩散模型提供更均匀的视觉学习信号。

Method: 使用图像条件掩码扩散语言模型进行训练，随机掩码图像-字幕对中的文本标记，训练基于视觉特征的解码器重构原始文本。训练后，学习到的视觉特征可应用于下游视觉任务。

Result: 在多种学术规模模型和数据集上的线性探测实验表明，MDC方法学习到的视觉特征与自回归和对比方法具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 掩码扩散字幕（MDC）提供了一种有效的视觉特征学习方法，其视觉学习信号不依赖于标记位置，减少了辅助目标的需求，在性能上与现有方法相当。

Abstract: We learn visual features by captioning images with an image-conditioned
masked diffusion language model, a formulation we call masked diffusion
captioning (MDC). During training, text tokens in each image-caption pair are
masked at a randomly chosen ratio, and a decoder conditioned on visual features
is trained to reconstruct the original text. After training, the learned visual
features can be applied to downstream vision tasks. Unlike autoregressive
captioning, the strength of the visual learning signal in MDC does not depend
on each token's position in the sequence, reducing the need for auxiliary
objectives. Linear probing experiments across a variety of academic-scale
models and datasets show that the learned visual features are competitive with
those produced by autoregressive and contrastive approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的2D提升方法主要关注外观生成，忽略了内在属性的感知，无法生成适合物理渲染的图形就绪3D场景。

Method: 提出轻量级高效的跨模态适配器结构，重用2D生成先验进行全景感知、生成和补全；构建大规模合成全景数据集。

Result: 实验证明模型在全景视觉感知和图形就绪3D场景生成方面有效，为沉浸式和物理真实的虚拟世界生成开辟新可能。

Conclusion: OmniX框架通过重新利用2D生成模型，实现了从全景图到图形就绪3D场景的生成，推动了沉浸式虚拟世界生成技术的发展。

Abstract: There are two prevalent ways to constructing 3D scenes: procedural generation
and 2D lifting. Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a
promising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce
immersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance
this technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically
based rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to
repurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures,
and PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasize
appearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, we
present OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight and
efficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors for
a broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception,
generation, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale synthetic
panorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse
indoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene
generation, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic
virtual world generation.

TL;DR: 该论文对视频生成模型Veo-3作为零样本推理器的能力进行了实证研究，发现其在空间一致性、细粒度定位和局部动态一致性方面表现良好，但在长时程因果推理、严格几何约束和抽象逻辑方面仍有限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视频生成模型是否能够作为零样本推理器在具有挑战性的视觉推理场景中使用，因为现有模型能够生成高保真、时间连贯的视频，表明它们可能编码了丰富的世界知识。

Method: 对领先的视频模型Veo-3在12个维度上进行全面评估，包括空间、几何、物理、时间和具身逻辑，并构建了MME-CoF基准来标准化评估链式帧推理。

Result: 研究发现当前视频模型在短时程空间一致性、细粒度定位和局部一致动态方面表现出有希望的推理模式，但在长时程因果推理、严格几何约束和抽象逻辑方面仍存在限制。

Conclusion: 当前视频模型还不能作为独立的零样本推理器可靠使用，但作为专用推理模型的补充视觉引擎显示出令人鼓舞的潜力。

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent
videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond
realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual
perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still
remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging
visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to
comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular
Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including
spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically
characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,
we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables
in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our
findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning
patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and
locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal
reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are
not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging
signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了StreetMath基准来评估LLM在现实近似场景下的近似推理能力，发现LLM倾向于精确计算而非近似，且精确与近似运算依赖不同的神经组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM在精确算术运算上的表现，但在非正式、快速近似推理方面的能力研究不足，特别是在非自回归解码器模型中。

Method: 引入StreetMath基准，在不同LLM架构上进行广泛评估，并应用机制可解释性技术探查内部计算状态。

Result: LLM在需要近似的任务中仍试图计算精确值或调用外部工具；模型有时在早期层就得到正确答案但仍消耗更多token；精确与近似算术运算依赖不同的神经组件。

Conclusion: LLM在街算场景中不像人类那样表现出认知吝啬性，精确与近似运算在神经网络中具有分离性。

Abstract: There is a substantial body of literature examining the mathematical
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
performance on precise arithmetic operations in autoregressive architectures.
However, their ability to perform approximate reasoning in informal, fast-paced
mathematical operations has received far less attention, especially among
non-autoregressive decoder models. Our work addresses this gap by introducing
StreetMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' approximation abilities
under real-world approximation scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations
across different LLM architectures: Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507,
Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, Dream-v0-Instruct-7B, Falcon-Mamba-7B-Instruct, and
Mamba-GPT-3B. Furthermore, we apply mechanistic interpretability techniques to
probe their internal computational states. Our analysis reveals that LLMs
generally attempt to compute exact values or invoke external tools even in
tasks that call for approximation. Moreover, while models sometimes reach the
correct answer in early layers or steps, they still consume more tokens when
solving approximation tasks. Additional experiments indicate that exact and
approximate arithmetic operations rely on largely separate neural components.
Drawing upon research on cognitive psychology, we argue that LLMs do not
exhibit cognitive miserliness in the same way humans do in street math
settings. We open source our work https://github.com/ctseng777/StreetMath

Conclusion: 该方法能够更准确地评估实体评论的情感强度和极性，为基于用户查询的实体排名提供更精确的依据

Abstract: Opinion mining, also called sentiment analysis, is the field of study that
analyzes people opinions, sentiments, evaluations, appraisals, attitudes, and
emotions towards entities such as products, services, organizations,
individuals, issues, events, topics, and their attributes. Holistic
lexicon-based approach does not consider the strength of each opinion, i.e.,
whether the opinion is very strongly negative (or positive), strongly negative
(or positive), moderate negative (or positive), very weakly negative (or
positive) and weakly negative (or positive). In this paper, we propose approach
to rank entities based on orientation and strength of the entity reviews and
user's queries by classifying them in granularity levels (i.e. very weak, weak,
moderate, very strong and strong) by combining opinion words (i.e. adverb,
adjective, noun and verb) that are related to aspect of interest of certain
product. We shall use fuzzy logic algorithmic approach in order to classify
opinion words into different category and syntactic dependency resolution to
find relations for desired aspect words. Opinion words related to certain
aspects of interest are considered to find the entity score for that aspect in
the review.

Motivation: 当前立场检测研究主要集中在目标相关任务且多为英语数据集，韩语等低资源语言缺乏相关研究资源。

Method: 从韩国政党新闻稿中收集数据，构建大规模韩语句子数据集，并训练最先进的深度学习模型进行立场检测。

Conclusion: LASTIST数据集为韩语立场检测研究提供了重要资源，填补了低资源语言在该领域的研究空白。

Abstract: Stance detection has emerged as an area of research in the field of
artificial intelligence. However, most research is currently centered on the
target-dependent stance detection task, which is based on a person's stance in
favor of or against a specific target. Furthermore, most benchmark datasets are
based on English, making it difficult to develop models in low-resource
languages such as Korean, especially for an emerging field such as stance
detection. This study proposes the LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance
(LASTIST) dataset to fill this research gap. Collected from the press releases
of both parties on Korean political parties, the LASTIST dataset uses 563,299
labeled Korean sentences. We provide a detailed description of how we collected
and constructed the dataset and trained state-of-the-art deep learning and
stance detection models. Our LASTIST dataset is designed for various tasks in
stance detection, including target-independent stance detection and diachronic
evolution stance detection. We deploy our dataset on

TL;DR: 提出zFLoRA方法，一种零延迟的融合低秩适配器，在基础模型上引入零或可忽略的延迟开销，解决了传统适配器在推理时的显著计算开销问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型部署时使用任务特定适配器，虽然适配器参数很少（通常低于基础模型的1%），但在推理时会产生不成比例的高计算开销（可达基础模型的2.5倍）。

Method: 提出零延迟融合低秩适配器(zFLoRA)，通过融合技术消除适配器带来的额外延迟，在基础模型上实现零或可忽略的延迟开销。

Result: 在1B、3B和7B规模的LLM上，zFLoRA在18个不同任务（常识推理、数学推理、摘要对话）上表现优于流行的监督微调基准，包括LoRA和全微调。在NPU和GPU平台上均显示零到可忽略的延迟开销。

Conclusion: zFLoRA是一种有效的适配器方法，能够在不增加推理延迟的情况下实现与全微调相当的性能，解决了传统适配器在推理效率方面的问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed with task-specific
adapters catering to multiple downstream applications. In such a scenario, the
additional compute associated with these apparently insignificant number of
adapter parameters (typically less than 1% of the base model) turns out to be
disproportionately significant during inference time (upto 2.5x times that of
the base model). In this paper, we propose a new zero-latency fused low-rank
adapter (zFLoRA) that introduces zero or negligible latency overhead on top of
the base model. Experimental results on LLMs of size 1B, 3B and 7B show that
zFLoRA compares favorably against the popular supervised fine-tuning benchmarks
including low-rank adapters (LoRA) as well as full fine-tuning (FFT).
Experiments are conducted on 18 different tasks across three different
categories namely commonsense reasoning, math reasoning and summary-dialogue.
Latency measurements made on NPU (Samsung Galaxy S25+) as well as GPU (NVIDIA
H100) platforms show that the proposed zFLoRA adapters introduce zero to
negligible latency overhead.

edges with consistent attribution scores. Second, we introduce a simple
ratio-based selection strategy to prioritize strong positive-scoring edges,
balancing performance and faithfulness. Third, we replace the standard greedy
selection with an integer linear programming formulation. Our methods yield
more faithful circuits and outperform prior approaches across multiple MIB

Abstract: Human experts often struggle to select the best option from a large set of
items with multiple competing objectives, a process bottlenecked by the
difficulty of formalizing complex, implicit preferences. To address this, we
introduce LISTEN, a framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) as a
zero-shot preference oracle, guided only by an expert's high-level priorities
in natural language. To operate within LLM constraints like context windows and
inference costs, we propose two iterative algorithms: LISTEN-U, which uses the
LLM to refine a parametric utility function, and LISTEN-T, a non-parametric
method that performs tournament-style selections over small batches of
solutions. Evaluated on diverse tasks including flight booking, shopping, and
exam scheduling, our results show LISTEN-U excels when preferences are
parametrically aligned (a property we measure with a novel concordance metric),
while LISTEN-T offers more robust performance. This work explores a promising
direction for steering complex multi-objective decisions directly with natural
language, reducing the cognitive burden of traditional preference elicitation.

TL;DR: LongFilter是一个用于长上下文预训练的数据筛选框架，通过对比模型在长上下文和短上下文设置下的预测差异，识别需要长距离依赖的样本，从而高效选择高质量训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的长文本数据大多缺乏有意义的长距离依赖关系，大部分内容仅通过局部上下文即可预测，导致训练效率低下，因此需要精心筛选数据。

Method: LongFilter通过对比模型在长上下文和短上下文设置下的预测差异来测量扩展上下文带来的信息增益，识别那些长距离依赖至关重要的样本。

Result: 在LLaMA-3-8B模型上将上下文长度从8K扩展到64K的实验表明，LongFilter能高效选择高质量数据，并在HELMET、LongBench和RULER等基准测试上取得显著改进。

Conclusion: LongFilter框架能有效识别需要长距离依赖的训练样本，提高长上下文预训练的数据选择效率，从而提升模型性能。

Abstract: Long-context language models unlock advanced capabilities in reasoning, code
generation, and document summarization by leveraging dependencies across
extended spans of text. However, a significant portion of readily available
long-text data lacks meaningful long-distance dependencies; most spans can be
predicted using only local context. Training on such data is inefficient,
making careful data selection crucial. Therefore, we introduce LongFilter, a
framework for curating training data tailored to long-context pretraining.
LongFilter measures the information gain provided by extended context by
contrasting model predictions under long-context versus short-context settings,
thereby identifying samples where long-range dependencies are essential.
Experiments with LLaMA-3-8B, extending its context length from 8K to 64K, show
that LongFilter efficiently selects high-quality data and yields substantial
improvements on benchmarks such as HELMET, LongBench, and RULER.

Motivation: 确保LLMs在内容审核系统中的公平性和中立性，研究角色采用如何影响不同模型架构、规模和内容模态下的有害内容分类。

Method: 通过分析不同意识形态倾向的角色对有害内容分类的影响，包括一致性分析、协议分析和针对政治任务的额外研究。

Result: 角色意识形态倾向显著影响有害内容判定，模型更倾向于与相同意识形态的角色保持一致，强化内部一致性同时扩大跨意识形态分歧。

Conclusion: 角色调节可能将微妙的意识形态偏见引入LLM输出，对以中立为幌子强化党派观点的AI系统使用提出担忧。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in content moderation
systems, where ensuring fairness and neutrality is essential. In this study, we
examine how persona adoption influences the consistency and fairness of harmful
content classification across different LLM architectures, model sizes, and
content modalities (language vs. vision). At first glance, headline performance
metrics suggest that personas have little impact on overall classification
accuracy. However, a closer analysis reveals important behavioral shifts.
Personas with different ideological leanings display distinct propensities to
label content as harmful, showing that the lens through which a model "views"
input can subtly shape its judgments. Further agreement analyses highlight that
models, particularly larger ones, tend to align more closely with personas from
the same political ideology, strengthening within-ideology consistency while
widening divergence across ideological groups. To show this effect more
directly, we conducted an additional study on a politically targeted task,
which confirmed that personas not only behave more coherently within their own
ideology but also exhibit a tendency to defend their perspective while
downplaying harmfulness in opposing views. Together, these findings highlight
how persona conditioning can introduce subtle ideological biases into LLM
outputs, raising concerns about the use of AI systems that may reinforce
partisan perspectives under the guise of neutrality.

TL;DR: CLEAR方法通过实体感知检索在临床问答任务中实现了更好的性能（F1分数0.90 vs 0.86），同时减少了70%以上的token使用量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的临床文档以base64编码附件形式存储，使得语义问答变得困难，传统向量数据库方法常常错过细微的临床关系。

Method: 开发了临床实体增强检索（CLEAR）方法，使用实体感知检索，并构建了临床笔记QA评估平台来验证该方法。

Result: CLEAR在12个临床笔记上测试，获得了58.3%的胜率，平均语义相似度0.878，比宽上下文处理减少了78%的token使用。在超过65,000个token的长文档上胜率达到75%。

Conclusion: 实体感知检索在临床自然语言处理中同时提高了效率和准确性，该评估框架为评估临床问答系统提供了可重用和透明的基准。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) store clinical documentation as base64
encoded attachments in FHIR DocumentReference resources, which makes semantic
question answering difficult. Traditional vector database methods often miss
nuanced clinical relationships. The Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR)
method, introduced by Lopez et al. 2025, uses entity aware retrieval and
achieved improved performance with an F1 score of 0.90 versus 0.86 for
embedding based retrieval, while using over 70 percent fewer tokens. We
developed a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform to validate CLEAR against
zero shot large context inference and traditional chunk based retrieval
augmented generation. The platform was tested on 12 clinical notes ranging from
10,000 to 65,000 tokens representing realistic EHR content. CLEAR achieved a
58.3 percent win rate, an average semantic similarity of 0.878, and used 78
percent fewer tokens than wide context processing. The largest performance
gains occurred on long notes, with a 75 percent win rate for documents
exceeding 65,000 tokens. These findings confirm that entity aware retrieval
improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical natural language processing.
The evaluation framework provides a reusable and transparent benchmark for
assessing clinical question answering systems where semantic precision and
computational efficiency are critical.

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for unlocking their
task generalization potential and domain-specific capabilities. However, the
current LLM post-training paradigm faces significant data challenges, including
the high costs of manual annotation and diminishing marginal returns on data
scales. Therefore, achieving data-efficient post-training has become a key
research question. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey of
data-efficient LLM post-training from a data-centric perspective. We propose a
taxonomy of data-efficient LLM post-training methods, covering data selection,
data quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, data distillation and
compression, and self-evolving data ecosystems. We summarize representative
approaches in each category and outline future research directions. By
examining the challenges in data-efficient LLM post-training, we highlight open
problems and propose potential research avenues. We hope our work inspires
further exploration into maximizing the potential of data utilization in
large-scale model training. Paper List:

TL;DR: 本文评估了使用LLM进行FrameNet语义标注的自动化和半自动化方法，发现半自动标注在框架多样性和标注覆盖率方面表现最佳，而全自动标注除标注时间外其他指标均较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM工具在语言资源创建中具有潜力，但对其在标注数据集创建中的性能和影响缺乏全面评估，特别是在视角化NLP方法下。

Method: 比较了三种实验设置下的标注时间、覆盖率和多样性：手动标注、自动标注和半自动标注，使用基于LLM的语义角色标注器。

Result: 半自动标注设置相比纯人工设置提高了框架多样性并保持相似标注覆盖率，而自动设置在除标注时间外的所有指标上都表现明显较差。

Conclusion: 混合半自动标注方法在语义标注任务中具有优势，能在保持质量的同时提高效率，而纯自动方法在质量方面仍有不足。

Abstract: The use of LLM-based applications as a means to accelerate and/or substitute
human labor in the creation of language resources and dataset is a reality.
Nonetheless, despite the potential of such tools for linguistic research,
comprehensive evaluation of their performance and impact on the creation of
annotated datasets, especially under a perspectivized approach to NLP, is still
missing. This paper contributes to reduction of this gap by reporting on an
extensive evaluation of the (semi-)automatization of FrameNet-like semantic
annotation by the use of an LLM-based semantic role labeler. The methodology
employed compares annotation time, coverage and diversity in three experimental
settings: manual, automatic and semi-automatic annotation. Results show that
the hybrid, semi-automatic annotation setting leads to increased frame
diversity and similar annotation coverage, when compared to the human-only
setting, while the automatic setting performs considerably worse in all
metrics, except for annotation time.

TL;DR: RECAP是一个代理式管道，通过反馈循环从LLM中提取和验证记忆的训练数据，包括检测和绕过对齐拒绝的模块，在EchoTrace基准测试中显著提升了提取效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当无法检查大型语言模型的训练数据时，需要一种方法来验证模型是否记忆了特定内容，最有力的证据是模型自由复现目标内容。

Method: RECAP采用反馈驱动循环：初始提取尝试由次级语言模型评估，比较输出与参考段落，识别差异并转化为最小修正提示，反馈给目标模型指导后续生成；还包括检测和克服对齐拒绝的越狱模块。

Result: 在EchoTrace基准测试（涵盖30多本完整书籍）上，RECAP相比单次迭代方法有显著提升。使用GPT-4.1时，受版权文本提取的平均ROUGE-L分数从0.38提高到0.47，增加了近24%。

Conclusion: RECAP能够有效提取和验证LLM记忆的训练数据，通过反馈循环和越狱模块显著提升了提取效果，为验证模型训练数据提供了一种可行方法。

Abstract: If we cannot inspect the training data of a large language model (LLM), how
can we ever know what it has seen? We believe the most compelling evidence
arises when the model itself freely reproduces the target content. As such, we
propose RECAP, an agentic pipeline designed to elicit and verify memorized
training data from LLM outputs. At the heart of RECAP is a feedback-driven
loop, where an initial extraction attempt is evaluated by a secondary language
model, which compares the output against a reference passage and identifies
discrepancies. These are then translated into minimal correction hints, which
are fed back into the target model to guide subsequent generations. In
addition, to address alignment-induced refusals, RECAP includes a jailbreaking
module that detects and overcomes such barriers. We evaluate RECAP on
EchoTrace, a new benchmark spanning over 30 full books, and the results show
that RECAP leads to substantial gains over single-iteration approaches. For
instance, with GPT-4.1, the average ROUGE-L score for the copyrighted text
extraction improved from 0.38 to 0.47 - a nearly 24% increase.

TL;DR: 本文研究了多语言数据混合对预训练大语言模型的影响，挑战了多语言训练会降低性能的常见观点，发现适当平衡的多语言数据可以增强模型能力而不损害性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多语言数据混合对LLM预训练的影响，探讨语言覆盖范围与模型性能之间的潜在权衡（即多语言诅咒问题）。

Method: 训练了1.1B和3B参数的LLM，在包含25到400种语言的多语言语料库上进行实验，研究英语作为枢纽语言的作用以及语言家族内选择枢纽语言的效果。

Result: 发现英语和多语言数据结合不会降低任何语言组的性能；英语作为枢纽语言对所有语言家族都有益；在此规模模型中没有观察到明显的多语言诅咒现象。

Conclusion: 适当平衡的多语言数据可以增强语言模型能力，即使在低资源环境下也不会损害性能，多语言训练不一定会导致性能下降。

Abstract: The impact of different multilingual data mixtures in pretraining large
language models (LLMs) has been a topic of ongoing debate, often raising
concerns about potential trade-offs between language coverage and model
performance (i.e., the curse of multilinguality). In this work, we investigate
these assumptions by training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse
multilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400. Our study
challenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find
that combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the
in-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a
sufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we
observe that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language
that serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits
across language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot
language from within a specific family does not consistently improve
performance for languages within that family. Lastly, we do not observe a
significant "curse of multilinguality" as the number of training languages
increases in models at this scale. Our findings suggest that multilingual data,
when balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without
compromising performance, even in low-resource settings

Motivation: 研究文化对齐在机器翻译中对语义标签保存的影响，因为文化差异可能导致翻译过程中的标签漂移或改变。

Method: 通过一系列实验，比较文化敏感领域和中性领域中不同机器翻译系统（包括统计机器翻译和现代大语言模型）的表现。

Result: 发现机器翻译系统（包括LLMs）在文化敏感领域会导致标签漂移；LLMs编码文化知识会放大漂移；语言间的文化相似性是标签保存的关键因素。

Conclusion: 忽视机器翻译中的文化因素不仅会损害标签保真度，还会在下游应用中导致误解和文化冲突风险。

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) is widely employed to address resource scarcity in
low-resource languages by generating synthetic data from high-resource
counterparts. While sentiment preservation in translation has long been
studied, a critical but underexplored factor is the role of cultural alignment
between source and target languages. In this paper, we hypothesize that
semantic labels are drifted or altered during MT due to cultural divergence.
Through a series of experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral
domains, we establish three key findings: (1) MT systems, including modern
Large Language Models (LLMs), induce label drift during translation,
particularly in culturally sensitive domains; (2) unlike earlier statistical MT
tools, LLMs encode cultural knowledge, and leveraging this knowledge can
amplify label drift; and (3) cultural similarity or dissimilarity between
source and target languages is a crucial determinant of label preservation. Our
findings highlight that neglecting cultural factors in MT not only undermines
label fidelity but also risks misinterpretation and cultural conflict in
downstream applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂数学推理中表现不佳，基于文本的生成导致未经验证和算术上不可靠的解决方案，当前提示策略缺乏确定性验证机制。

Method: 引入SymCode框架，将数学问题解决重新定义为使用SymPy库的可验证代码生成任务，通过符号引擎对LLM推理进行确定性验证。

Result: 在MATH-500和OlympiadBench等挑战性基准测试中，相比基线方法准确率提高了高达13.6个百分点，且更节省token。

Conclusion: 通过将LLM推理建立在确定性符号引擎基础上，SymCode代表了在形式化领域实现更准确和可信赖AI的关键一步，将模型失败从模糊的逻辑谬误转向透明的程序化错误。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, where prose-based generation leads to unverified and arithmetically
unsound solutions. Current prompting strategies like Chain of Thought still
operate within this unreliable medium, lacking a mechanism for deterministic
verification. To address these limitations, we introduce SymCode, a
neurosymbolic framework that reframes mathematical problem-solving as a task of
verifiable code generation using the SymPy library. We evaluate SymCode on
challenging benchmarks, including MATH-500 and OlympiadBench, demonstrating
significant accuracy improvements of up to 13.6 percentage points over
baselines. Our analysis shows that SymCode is not only more token-efficient but
also fundamentally shifts model failures from opaque logical fallacies towards
transparent, programmatic errors. By grounding LLM reasoning in a deterministic
symbolic engine, SymCode represents a key step towards more accurate and
trustworthy AI in formal domains.

Motivation: Trainium AI加速器虽然为LLM训练和推理提供了有吸引力的异构架构方案，但其脉动阵列架构和数据布局的特殊要求使得实现高性能具有挑战性。

Method: 基于内核融合和新型缓存策略，设计针对Trainium优化的矩阵乘法内核，减少软件管理内存层次中的数据移动，最大化SRAM带宽，避免昂贵的矩阵转置操作。

Result: 在9个数据集和4个最新LLM上的评估显示，矩阵乘法内核平均提速1.35倍（最高2.22倍），端到端LLM推理平均提速1.66倍（最高2.49倍）。

Conclusion: 针对Trainium架构定制的优化技术能显著提升LLM推理性能，证明了所提方法的有效性。

Abstract: AI accelerators, customized to AI workloads, provide cost-effective and
high-performance solutions for training and inference. Trainium, an AI
accelerator recently developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides an
attractive option for LLM training and inference through its heterogeneous
architecture. However, leveraging Trainium architecture for high performance
can be challenging because of its systolic array architecture and special
requirement on data layout. In this paper, we design high-performance matrix
multiplication (matmul), a critical compute kernel, for LLM inference on
Trainium. We introduce a series of techniques customized to Trainium based on
kernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across the
software-managed memory hierarchy, maximize SRAM bandwidth, and avoid expensive
matrix transpose. Evaluating with nine datasets and four recent LLMs, we show
that our system largely outperforms the state-of-the-art matmul implemented by
AWS on Trainium: at the level of matmul kernel, it achieves an average 1.35x
speedup (up to 2.22x), which translates to an average 1.66x speedup (up to
2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference.

TL;DR: AttnCache通过检索和重用相似的注意力图来加速LLM推理的prefill阶段，在CPU和GPU上分别实现1.2x和1.6x的端到端加速，注意力计算速度提升2x和3x，精度损失可忽略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多实际工作负载（如分类、问答、推荐等）仅使用LLM推理的prefill阶段，其中自注意力计算因其与序列长度的二次复杂度成为主要性能瓶颈。

Method: 基于观察到语义不同的句子在不同层和头中产生相似注意力图的洞察，提出AttnCache框架，通过注意力图记忆数据库、高效缓存和相似性搜索技术来检索和重用预缓存的注意力图。

Result: 实验结果显示，在CPU上平均实现1.2x端到端和2x注意力加速，在GPU上实现1.6x端到端和3x注意力加速，精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: AttnCache通过重用相似注意力图有效加速LLM prefill阶段推理，显著降低自注意力计算开销，为实际应用提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in generative applications such
as chatting, code generation, and reasoning. However, many realworld workloads
such as classification, question answering, recommendation, and text embedding
rely solely on the prefill stage of inference, where the model encodes input
sequences without performing autoregressive decoding. In these prefill only
scenarios, the self-attention computation becomes the primary performance
bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. In
this paper, we observe that semantically different sentences often produce
similar attention maps across layers and heads. Building on this insight, we
propose AttnCache, a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of LLM
inference by retrieving and reusing similar attention maps. Based on an
attention map memorization database, AttnCache employs efficient caching and
similarity search techniques to identify and reuse pre-cached attention maps
during inference, thereby reducing the computational overhead of
self-attention. Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of
1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x
attention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy degradation.

TL;DR: 提出监督强化学习(SRL)框架，将问题解决重新定义为生成逻辑"动作"序列，通过内部推理独白和基于专家动作相似度的逐步奖励，解决小规模开源模型在多步推理任务中的训练难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多步推理任务上表现不佳。对于小规模开源模型，强化学习在正确解罕见时失败，而监督微调则容易通过逐词模仿对长演示过拟合。需要一种能提供更丰富学习信号、鼓励灵活推理的训练方法。

Method: SRL框架将问题解决建模为生成逻辑动作序列，训练模型在提交每个动作前生成内部推理独白。基于模型动作与SFT数据集中专家动作的相似度提供逐步奖励，即使所有尝试都错误也能提供学习信号。

Result: SRL使小模型能够学习之前SFT或RLVR无法学习的挑战性问题。先用SRL初始化训练再用RLVR精炼可获得最强性能。SRL还能有效泛化到智能软件工程任务。

Conclusion: SRL是一个稳健且通用的面向推理的LLM训练框架，通过结合监督学习和强化学习的优势，解决了小模型在多步推理任务中的训练挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with problems that require
multi-step reasoning. For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely
sampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to
overfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address
this gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that
reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical "actions". SRL
trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing
to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between
the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a
step-wise manner. This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all
rollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert
demonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging
problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training
with SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance.
Beyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software
engineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework
for reasoning-oriented LLMs.

TL;DR: PORTool是一种强化学习方法，通过鼓励工具使用LLM探索多种正确轨迹来提升在动态工具调用环境中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于静态数据集训练的工具使用LLM只能模仿通用工具调用流程，无法探索可能的解决方案，在动态工具调用环境中表现有限。

Method: 使用强化学习：1)为给定查询生成多个轨迹，形成树状结构；2)基于产生正确答案和成功工具调用的能力为每个步骤分配奖励；3)使用分叉相对优势和轨迹相对优势训练LLM。

Result: 在17个工具的实验中，PORTool在最终准确率和工具调用步骤数量方面显著优于其他训练方法。

Conclusion: PORTool通过强化学习探索多种轨迹的方法有效提升了工具使用LLM在动态环境中的性能。

Abstract: Current tool-use large language models (LLMs) are trained on static datasets,
enabling them to interact with external tools and perform multi-step,
tool-integrated reasoning, which produces tool-call trajectories. However,
these models imitate how a query is resolved in a generic tool-call routine,
thereby failing to explore possible solutions and demonstrating limited
performance in an evolved, dynamic tool-call environment. In this work, we
propose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a
tool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer.
Specifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given
query, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a
tree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability
to produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step
across different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps
under the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards
are used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with
trajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use. The experiments
utilize 17 tools to address user queries, covering both time-sensitive and
time-invariant topics. We conduct ablation studies to systematically justify
the necessity and the design robustness of step-wise rewards. Furthermore, we
compare the proposed PORTool with other training approaches and demonstrate
significant improvements in final accuracy and the number of tool-call steps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨语言对齐虽然能促进多语言表示的对齐和知识迁移，但可能导致文化擦除问题，即模型无法提供基于查询语言的文化情境化响应。

Method: 引入转移-本地化平面评估框架量化知识转移和文化擦除的权衡，分析模型内部表示，并提出Surgical Steering推理时方法，通过对不同层应用针对性激活引导来分离事实迁移和文化特定知识。

Result: 研究发现现有CLA方法在六种语言中都一致地以牺牲文化本地化为代价改善事实转移，模型内部表示显示通用事实迁移和文化特定知识在不同层最优可控。

Conclusion: Surgical Steering方法能更好地平衡知识转移和文化本地化这两个竞争维度，有效克服当前对齐技术的局限性。

Abstract: Cross-lingual alignment (CLA) aims to align multilingual representations,
enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to seamlessly transfer knowledge across
languages. While intuitive, we hypothesize, this pursuit of representational
convergence can inadvertently cause "cultural erasure", the functional loss of
providing culturally-situated responses that should diverge based on the query
language. In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing
a holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which
quantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure.
Using this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they
consistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural
localization across all six languages studied. Our investigation into the
internal representations of these models reveals a key insight: universal
factual transfer and culturally-specific knowledge are optimally steerable at
different model layers. Based on this finding, we propose Surgical Steering, a
novel inference-time method that disentangles these two objectives. By applying
targeted activation steering to distinct layers, our approach achieves a better
balance between the two competing dimensions, effectively overcoming the
limitations of current alignment techniques.

Result: 在115,683名患者中，7.8%有偶然甲状腺发现，其中92.9%为结节。这些发现与更高的甲状腺结节诊断、活检、甲状腺切除术和甲状腺癌诊断风险相关。

Conclusion: 偶然甲状腺发现很常见，并强烈关联于导致低风险小癌症检测的级联效应，凸显了其在甲状腺癌过度诊断中的作用以及需要标准化报告和更有选择性的随访。

Abstract: Importance Incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) are increasingly detected on
imaging performed for non-thyroid indications. Their prevalence, features, and
clinical consequences remain undefined. Objective To develop, validate, and
deploy a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs in
radiology reports and assess their prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes.
Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort of adults without prior
thyroid disease undergoing thyroid-capturing imaging at Mayo Clinic sites from
July 1, 2017, to September 30, 2023. A transformer-based NLP pipeline
identified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from
multiple modalities and body regions. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of
ITFs, downstream thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer
diagnosis. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related
factors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9%
women), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more
likely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was
ordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were
more likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule
characteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other
features in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients
without ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis,
biopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were
papillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were
common and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small,
low-risk cancers. These findings underscore the role of ITFs in thyroid cancer
overdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective
follow-up.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been applied to automatic
programming code generation. This task can be viewed as a language generation
task that bridges natural language, human knowledge, and programming logic.
However, it remains underexplored in domains that require interaction with
hardware devices, such as quantum programming, where human coders write Python
code that is executed on a quantum computer. To address this gap, we introduce
QCoder Benchmark, an evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on quantum
programming with feedback from simulated hardware devices. Our benchmark offers
two key features. First, it supports evaluation using a quantum simulator
environment beyond conventional Python execution, allowing feedback of
domain-specific metrics such as circuit depth, execution time, and error
classification, which can be used to guide better generation. Second, it
incorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming
contests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of
LLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even
advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting

*Feng Ju,Zeyu Qin,Rui Min,Zhitao He,Lingpeng Kong,Yi R. Fung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出1PNS训练范式，通过引入推理路径差异度(RPD)指标来选择和训练多样化的推理路径，提高模型输出的多样性，从而增强测试时扩展的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的"一个问题一个答案"训练方式导致模型输出多样性不足，限制了测试时扩展的效果。需要一种能够提供多样化推理路径的训练方法。

Method: 提出1PNS训练范式，引入RPD指标来衡量多步思维链之间的语义差异，基于RPD选择最大多样性的解决方案集进行微调。

Result: 实验显示RPD选择的训练数据产生更多样化的输出和更高的pass@k，在pass@16上平均提升2.80%，在AIME24上提升4.99%。

Conclusion: 1PNS训练范式能有效提高模型输出多样性，进一步增强测试时扩展的效果。

Abstract: While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs), low diversity in model outputs often
becomes a bottleneck; this is partly caused by the common "one problem, one
solution" (1P1S) training practice, which provides a single canonical answer
and can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths. To address this, we
propose a "one problem, multiple solutions" (1PNS) training paradigm that
exposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus
increases inference diversity. A core challenge for 1PNS is reliably measuring
semantic differences between multi-step chains of thought, so we introduce
Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric that aligns and scores
Long Chain-of-Thought solutions to capture differences in intermediate
reasoning. Using RPD, we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and
fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base. Experiments show that RPD-selected training yields
more varied outputs and higher pass@k, with an average +2.80% gain in pass@16
over a strong 1P1S baseline and a +4.99% gain on AIME24, demonstrating that
1PNS further amplifies the effectiveness of TTS. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 本文利用大语言模型和提示工程研究说服技巧与话语关系之间的联系，通过创建银标注数据集发现六种话语关系在说服性文本中起关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏同时标注说服技巧和话语关系的数据集，研究旨在探索这两种语言现象之间的关系，以帮助检测网络宣传和错误信息。

Method: 使用SemEval 2023任务3数据集，开发基于LLM的分类器标注PDTB 3.0二级话语关系，评估4个LLM和10种提示，创建5个银标注数据集。

Result: 统计分析显示六种话语关系（原因、目的、对比、原因+信念、让步、条件）在说服性文本中至关重要，特别是在使用负载语言、夸张/最小化、重复和质疑时。

Conclusion: 这项研究为理解有效沟通提供了新见解，有助于检测在线宣传和错误信息，揭示了话语关系在说服技巧中的重要作用。

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between Persuasion Techniques (PTs)
and Discourse Relations (DRs) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and
prompt engineering. Since no dataset annotated with both PTs and DRs exists, we
took the SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset labelled with 19 PTs as a starting point
and developed LLM-based classifiers to label each instance of the dataset with
one of the 22 PDTB 3.0 level-2 DRs. In total, four LLMs were evaluated using 10
different prompts, resulting in 40 unique DR classifiers. Ensemble models using
different majority-pooling strategies were used to create 5 silver datasets of
instances labelled with both persuasion techniques and level-2 PDTB senses. The
silver dataset sizes vary from 1,281 instances to 204 instances, depending on
the majority pooling technique used. Statistical analysis of these silver
datasets shows that six discourse relations (namely Cause, Purpose, Contrast,
Cause+Belief, Concession, and Condition) play a crucial role in persuasive
texts, especially in the use of Loaded Language, Exaggeration/Minimisation,
Repetition and to cast Doubt. This insight can contribute to detecting online
propaganda and misinformation, as well as to our general understanding of
effective communication.

TL;DR: MossNet是一种新颖的混合状态空间专家架构，通过MoE实现多头注意力机制，在语言建模和下游任务中优于类似规模的Transformer和SSM模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SSM/GRM方法通常只模拟单个注意力头，可能限制表达能力，需要更有效的多头注意力模拟方案。

Method: 提出MossNet架构，在通道混合MLP块和时间混合SSM核中都使用混合专家(MoE)来实现多头注意力机制。

Result: MossNet在语言建模和下游评估中优于类似规模的Transformer和SSM架构，更大变体在万亿token训练中证实其可扩展性和优越性能。

Conclusion: MossNet为高效、高性能的循环LLM架构提供了一个有前景的新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced generative
applications in natural language processing (NLP). Recent trends in model
architectures revolve around efficient variants of transformers or
state-space/gated-recurrent models (SSMs, GRMs). However, prevailing
SSM/GRM-based methods often emulate only a single attention head, potentially
limiting their expressiveness. In this work, we propose MossNet, a novel
mixture-of-state-space-experts architecture that emulates a linear multi-head
attention (MHA). MossNet leverages a mixture-of-experts (MoE) implementation
not only in channel-mixing multi-layered perceptron (MLP) blocks but also in
the time-mixing SSM kernels to realize multiple "attention heads." Extensive
experiments on language modeling and downstream evaluations show that MossNet
outperforms both transformer- and SSM-based architectures of similar model size
and data budgets. Larger variants of MossNet, trained on trillions of tokens,
further confirm its scalability and superior performance. In addition,
real-device profiling on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and an Nvidia A100 GPU
demonstrate favorable runtime speed and resource usage compared to similarly
sized baselines. Our results suggest that MossNet is a compelling new direction
for efficient, high-performing recurrent LLM architectures.

TL;DR: 提出了相似性-距离-幅度（SDM）语言模型，通过微调使生成内容位于经过良好校准的高概率区域，使用SDM激活层进行指令遵循的二元分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进现有预训练语言模型的指令遵循能力，减少模型弃权（不生成内容）的情况，提高统计效率。

Method: 对预训练的仅解码器Transformer LM进行监督微调，使用最终层SDM激活层估计监督下一个标记损失的基变换，采用对比输入编码方案和在线生成的硬负例。

Result: 与强监督基线相比，SDM LM减少了弃权情况，提高了统计效率。

Conclusion: SDM LM框架能够有效提升语言模型的指令遵循能力，通过对比学习和在线负例生成实现更好的性能。

Abstract: We introduce Similarity-Distance-Magnitude (SDM) language models (LMs), which
are sequence prediction models fine-tuned to maximize the proportion of
generations in the well-calibrated, high-probability region partitioned by a
final-layer SDM activation layer used for binary classification of
instruction-following. We demonstrate that existing pre-trained decoder-only
Transformer LMs can be readily converted into SDM LMs via supervised
fine-tuning, using the final-layer SDM activation layer during training to
estimate a change-of-base for a supervised next-token loss over a contrastive
input encoding scheme, with additional hard negative examples generated online
during training. This results in reduced abstentions (i.e., improved
statistical efficiency) compared to strong supervised baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RCScore是一个多维度框架，通过系统地将基准问题转化为多种指令风格来量化指令表述对模型响应的影响，揭示了传统指标未检测到的性能变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM评估通常依赖单一指令模板，忽视了模型对指令风格的敏感性，这对实际部署至关重要。

Method: 通过系统地将基准问题转化为多种指令风格，并引入跨响应相似性(CRS)来衡量风格自一致性。

Result: 在四个推理基准上对十个LLM的实验表明，指令风格可使准确率变化高达16.7个百分点。CRS与任务准确率强相关，确定性解码产生更稳定的输出，模型规模与跨风格一致性正相关。

Conclusion: RCScore提供了一种原则性方法来评估指令鲁棒性，一致性可作为模型可靠性的有价值代理指标。

Abstract: Current LLM evaluations often rely on a single instruction template,
overlooking models' sensitivity to instruction style-a critical aspect for
real-world deployments. We present RCScore, a multi-dimensional framework
quantifying how instruction formulation affects model responses. By
systematically transforming benchmark problems into multiple instruction
styles, RCScore reveals performance variations undetected by conventional
metrics. Our experiments across ten LLMs on four reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that instruction style can shift accuracy by up to 16.7% points. We
introduce Cross-Response Similarity (CRS), a method applying RCScore metrics to
measure stylistic self-consistency, and establish its strong correlation with
task accuracy, suggesting consistency as a valuable proxy for model
reliability. Additional findings show that deterministic decoding produces more
stylistically stable outputs, and model scale correlates positively with
cross-style consistency. RCScore offers a principled approach to assess
instruction robustness.

*Woojin Kim,Jaeyoung Do*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Token Timestep Allocation (TTA)方法，通过为每个token分配不同的时间步调度来解决扩散语言模型中的更新遗忘问题，显著提升了控制性和流畅度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型在实际控制性方面存在脆弱性，主要问题是更新遗忘——均匀且上下文无关的更新会导致token级波动，抹去早期的语义编辑并破坏累积细化过程，从而降低流畅性和连贯性。

Method: 提出Token Timestep Allocation (TTA)，通过为每个token分配时间步调度实现软语义排序：关键token早期冻结，不确定token持续细化。可作为固定策略或基于任务信号的自适应策略实现。

Result: 在情感控制任务中，准确率提高20%以上，困惑度几乎减半，且仅使用不到五分之一的时间步；在去毒化任务中，最大毒性从14.5降至12.2，困惑度从32.0降至26.0。

Conclusion: 通过时间步分配实现的软化排序是缓解更新遗忘、实现稳定可控扩散文本生成的关键机制。

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their
practical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally
characterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform
and context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,
erasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement
process, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in
uniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token
ordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and
semantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are
frozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This
timestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an
adaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of
refinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies
uniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision
sources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment
control, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves
perplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers
maximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).
Together, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep
allocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving
stable and controllable diffusion text generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WIMHF方法使用稀疏自编码器解释人类反馈数据，识别可解释的特征来理解偏好数据的编码内容，揭示不同数据集中的人类偏好差异，并支持数据筛选和个性化应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类反馈可能以不可预测和不良的方式改变语言模型，但从业者缺乏对反馈数据编码内容的清晰理解。现有方法需要预先指定假设，难以自动提取相关特征。

Method: 引入WIMHF方法，使用稀疏自编码器解释反馈数据，表征数据集能够测量的偏好和注释者实际表达的偏好。

Result: 在7个数据集中，WIMHF识别出少量人类可解释的特征，这些特征占黑盒模型偏好预测信号的大部分。揭示了人类偏好的多样性，例如Reddit用户偏好非正式和笑话，而HH-RLHF和PRISM注释者则不喜欢。还发现了潜在的不安全偏好，如LMArena用户倾向于反对拒绝，支持有毒内容。

Conclusion: WIMHF提供了一种以人为中心的分析方法，帮助从业者更好地理解和利用偏好数据，支持有效的数据筛选和细粒度个性化。

Abstract: Human feedback can alter language models in unpredictable and undesirable
ways, as practitioners lack a clear understanding of what feedback data
encodes. While prior work studies preferences over certain attributes (e.g.,
length or sycophancy), automatically extracting relevant features without
pre-specifying hypotheses remains challenging. We introduce What's In My Human
Feedback? (WIMHF), a method to explain feedback data using sparse autoencoders.
WIMHF characterizes both (1) the preferences a dataset is capable of measuring
and (2) the preferences that the annotators actually express. Across 7
datasets, WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that
account for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by
black-box models. These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer,
and the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer
informality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them.
WIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users
tend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned
features enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in
Arena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance.
They also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment
dataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that
improve preference prediction. WIMHF provides a human-centered analysis method
for practitioners to better understand and use preference data.

TL;DR: 提出了首个专门评估全局检索增强生成能力的基准GlobalQA，并开发了GlobalRAG框架来解决现有RAG方法在全局任务上的性能不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG评估基准主要关注局部检索，但现实应用需要全局RAG能力——跨整个文档集合聚合和分析信息以获取语料级洞察。

Method: 提出GlobalRAG框架：通过块级检索保持结构连贯性，集成LLM驱动的智能过滤器去除噪声文档，并包含聚合模块进行精确符号计算。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-14B模型上，GlobalRAG达到6.63 F1分数，而最强基线仅为1.51 F1，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 全局RAG是一个重要但被忽视的能力，GlobalQA基准和GlobalRAG框架为解决这一挑战提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a leading approach to
reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Current RAG evaluation
benchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant
chunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only
localized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world
applications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --
which involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document
collections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, "What are the top 10
most cited papers in 2023?"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering
four core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k
extraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and
baselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,
with the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these
challenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that
preserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates
LLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates
aggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model,
GlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1,
validating the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: 通过将语用学理论作为提示提供给语言模型，可以显著提升其在理解隐含含义任务上的表现，相比基准方法最高可提升9.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确理解隐含含义在人类沟通中至关重要，语言模型也需要具备这种能力。现有方法在语用推理任务上表现不足，需要更有效的上下文学习方法。

Method: 提出将语用学理论（如Gricean语用学和关联理论）概述作为提示，引导语言模型通过逐步推理过程得出最终解释。

Result: 相比不提供语用学理论的基准方法（0-shot Chain-of-Thought），该方法使语言模型在语用推理任务上得分最高提升9.6%。即使在提示中仅提及语用学理论名称，在较大模型中也能带来1-3%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 将语用学理论作为提示是提升语言模型理解隐含含义能力的有效上下文学习方法。

Abstract: The ability to accurately interpret implied meanings plays a crucial role in
human communication and language use, and language models are also expected to
possess this capability. This study demonstrates that providing language models
with pragmatic theories as prompts is an effective in-context learning approach
for tasks to understand implied meanings. Specifically, we propose an approach
in which an overview of pragmatic theories, such as Gricean pragmatics and
Relevance Theory, is presented as a prompt to the language model, guiding it
through a step-by-step reasoning process to derive a final interpretation.
Experimental results showed that, compared to the baseline, which prompts
intermediate reasoning without presenting pragmatic theories (0-shot
Chain-of-Thought), our methods enabled language models to achieve up to 9.6\%
higher scores on pragmatic reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we show that even
without explaining the details of pragmatic theories, merely mentioning their
names in the prompt leads to a certain performance improvement (around 1-3%) in
larger models compared to the baseline.

Motivation: 研究预训练语言模型是否具备类似人类说话者区分借词和原生词的能力，特别是在双语社区中，主导语言持续对少数民族语言施加词汇影响的情况下。

Method: 评估了包括大语言模型在内的多个预训练模型在10种语言上的借词识别能力，使用了明确指令和上下文信息。

Result: 模型在区分借词和原生词方面表现不佳，证实了现代NLP系统存在对借词的偏见而非原生等价词。

Conclusion: 这项工作对开发少数民族语言的NLP工具以及在主导语言词汇压力下支持语言保护具有重要启示。

Abstract: Throughout language history, words are borrowed from one language to another
and gradually become integrated into the recipient's lexicon. Speakers can
often differentiate these loanwords from native vocabulary, particularly in
bilingual communities where a dominant language continuously imposes lexical
items on a minority language. This paper investigates whether pretrained
language models, including large language models, possess similar capabilities
for loanword identification. We evaluate multiple models across 10 languages.
Despite explicit instructions and contextual information, our results show that
models perform poorly in distinguishing loanwords from native ones. These
findings corroborate previous evidence that modern NLP systems exhibit a bias
toward loanwords rather than native equivalents. Our work has implications for
developing NLP tools for minority languages and supporting language
preservation in communities under lexical pressure from dominant languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在不同语言间性能不均，特别是在模型尺寸减小时问题更加严重。知识蒸馏在将知识从大模型迁移到小模型方面表现良好，但在多语言环境中的应用研究不足。

Method: 研究了五种知识蒸馏方法在CLIP和SigLIP2模型上的表现，评估了它们在领域内检索和领域外视觉问答任务中的效果。

Result: 发现某些配置在模型尺寸减半的情况下仍能保持甚至提升多语言检索的鲁棒性，但其他配置无法维持跨任务稳定性，揭示了仅靠聚合准确率无法反映的设计敏感权衡。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏在多语言视觉语言模型压缩中具有重要价值，但需要仔细选择蒸馏配置以确保跨语言和跨任务的性能稳定性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit uneven performance across languages, a
problem that is often exacerbated when the model size is reduced. While
Knowledge distillation (KD) demonstrates promising results in transferring
knowledge from larger to smaller VLMs, applying KD in multilingualism is an
underexplored area. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of KD
behavior across five distillation approaches, isolating their effects on
cross-lingual representation consistency and downstream performance stability
under model compression. We study five distillation formulations across CLIP
and SigLIP2, and evaluate them on in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual
QA. We find that some configurations preserve or even improve multilingual
retrieval robustness despite halving model size, but others fail to maintain
cross-task stability, exposing design-sensitive trade-offs that aggregate
accuracy alone does not reveal.

TL;DR: 提出了Neuron Agreement Decoding (NAD)方法，通过分析神经元激活模式来选择最佳候选答案，无需外部信号或文本比较，实现高效的无监督集成解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖外部输出信号（如token概率、熵或自评估），这些信号在训练后可能校准不佳。研究发现内部神经元激活包含更丰富的信息，正确回答激活更少的神经元且具有更强的跨样本一致性。

Method: 基于神经元激活稀疏性和跨样本神经元一致性，提出NAD方法进行候选答案选择。该方法仅使用内部信号，支持早期正确预测（前32个token内）和激进早停。

Result: 在数学和科学基准测试中与多数投票相当；在开放式编码基准测试中优于Avg@64。通过早期剪枝，减少99%的token使用，生成质量损失极小。

Conclusion: 内部信号为无标签集成解码提供了可靠、可扩展且高效的指导，表明神经元激活模式是比外部信号更优的评估指标。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) commonly boost reasoning via
sample-evaluate-ensemble decoders, achieving label free gains without ground
truth. However, prevailing strategies score candidates using only external
outputs such as token probabilities, entropies, or self evaluations, and these
signals can be poorly calibrated after post training. We instead analyze
internal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1)
external signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics;
(2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than
incorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct
responses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones
diverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding
(NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using
activation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on
internal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables
early correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports
aggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable
answers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where
majority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64. By
pruning unpromising trajectories early, NAD reduces token usage by 99% with
minimal loss in generation quality, showing that internal signals provide
reliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label free ensemble decoding.

Result: 发现不同语言模型学习到了可互换的数字表示，这些表示是系统性的、高度准确的，并且在不同隐藏状态和输入上下文类型中具有普遍性。

Conclusion: 为预训练LLMs如何操作数字提供了基本理解，并指出了更准确的探针技术在改进LLMs架构方面的潜力。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that different large language models (LLMs) converge to
similar and accurate input embedding representations for numbers. These
findings conflict with the documented propensity of LLMs to produce erroneous
outputs when dealing with numeric information. In this work, we aim to explain
this conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify
the lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms. We find that despite
surfacing errors, different language models learn interchangeable
representations of numbers that are systematic, highly accurate and universal
across their hidden states and the types of input contexts. This allows us to
create universal probes for each LLM and to trace information -- including the
causes of output errors -- to specific layers. Our results lay a fundamental
understanding of how pre-trained LLMs manipulate numbers and outline the
potential of more accurate probing techniques in addressed refinements of LLMs'
architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Atlas在信息检索任务中表现出色，但其在动态交互环境中的性能尚未充分探索，因此使用浏览器游戏作为测试场景进行评估。

Method: 使用浏览器游戏（T-Rex Runner、数独、Flappy Bird、Stein.world）作为测试场景，以游戏性能分数作为量化指标评估不同任务类型的表现。

Result: Atlas在数独等逻辑推理任务中表现强劲，完成速度显著快于人类基准，但在需要精确时机和运动控制的实时游戏中表现不佳，往往无法通过初始障碍。

Conclusion: Atlas具备强大的分析处理能力，但在需要实时交互的动态网页环境中仍存在明显局限性。

Abstract: OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas introduces new capabilities for web interaction,
enabling the model to analyze webpages, process user intents, and execute
cursor and keyboard inputs directly within the browser. While its capacity for
information retrieval tasks has been demonstrated, its performance in dynamic,
interactive environments remains less explored. In this study, we conduct an
early evaluation of Atlas's web interaction capabilities using browser-based
games as test scenarios, including Google's T-Rex Runner, Sudoku, Flappy Bird,
and Stein.world. We employ in-game performance scores as quantitative metrics
to assess performance across different task types. Our results show that Atlas
performs strongly in logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku, completing puzzles
significantly faster than human baselines, but struggles substantially in
real-time games requiring precise timing and motor control, often failing to
progress beyond initial obstacles. These findings suggest that while Atlas
demonstrates capable analytical processing, there remain notable limitations in
dynamic web environments requiring real-time interaction. The website of our
project can be found at https://atlas-game-eval.github.io.

TL;DR: SCRIBE是一个用于教育反馈的多跳工具增强推理框架，通过两阶段LoRA微调将GPT-4o能力蒸馏到3B和8B模型，在保持隐私和低资源需求的同时，实现了与大型模型相当的回答质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决教育场景中语言模型部署的三个关键挑战：隐私问题、有限计算资源、需要教学有效的响应，要求能在本地运行的小型开源模型。

Method: 结合领域特定工具与自反式推理管道，支持迭代推理、工具使用和错误恢复，通过两阶段LoRA微调在GPT-4o生成的合成数据上蒸馏能力。

Result: 8B-SCRIBE模型在相关性和可操作性等关键维度上达到或超过更大模型的质量，学生评价与GPT-4o和Llama-3.3 70B相当。

Conclusion: SCRIBE证明了在低资源、隐私敏感的教育应用中部署小型高效模型的可行性。

Abstract: Language models can be used to provide interactive, personalized student
feedback in educational settings. However, real-world deployment faces three
key challenges: privacy concerns, limited computational resources, and the need
for pedagogically valid responses. These constraints require small, open-source
models that can run locally and reliably ground their outputs in correct
information. We introduce SCRIBE, a framework for multi-hop, tool-augmented
reasoning designed to generate valid responses to student questions about
feedback reports. SCRIBE combines domain-specific tools with a self-reflective
inference pipeline that supports iterative reasoning, tool use, and error
recovery. We distil these capabilities into 3B and 8B models via two-stage LoRA
fine-tuning on synthetic GPT-4o-generated data. Evaluation with a human-aligned
GPT-Judge and a user study with 108 students shows that 8B-SCRIBE models
achieve comparable or superior quality to much larger models in key dimensions
such as relevance and actionability, while being perceived on par with GPT-4o
and Llama-3.3 70B by students. These findings demonstrate the viability of
SCRIBE for low-resource, privacy-sensitive educational applications.

TL;DR: ACER通过自动生成基于布鲁姆分类法的课程和问答对，将通用大语言模型转化为领域专家，在保持通用能力的同时显著提升专业领域表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在经济学、心理学等专业领域表现不佳的问题，这些领域需要深入的原则性理解。

Method: ACER方法：1)自动生成教科书式课程大纲和内容；2)基于布鲁姆分类法创建问答对；3)使用交错课程安排进行持续预训练，确保内容和认知维度的对齐学习。

Result: 在Llama 3.2模型上测试显示：微观经济学准确率提升5个百分点，所有目标领域平均提升3个百分点，非目标领域也提升0.7个百分点，ARC和GPQA基准提升超2个百分点，同时保持通用推理任务稳定。

Conclusion: ACER提供了一种可扩展且有效的方法来弥补大语言模型在关键领域的性能差距，既能防止灾难性遗忘，又能促进跨领域知识迁移。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at general tasks but underperform in
specialized domains like economics and psychology, which require deep,
principled understanding. To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated
Curriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain
experts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a
comprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for
a subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's
taxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing
difficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining
with an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content
and cognitive dimensions.
  Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized
MMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines
struggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target
domains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage
points. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also
facilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on
non-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on
knowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points,
while maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ACER offers a scalable and effective recipe for closing
critical domain gaps in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出MisSynth管道，通过检索增强生成合成谬误样本，微调LLM模型，显著提升识别科学健康相关错误信息的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 健康相关错误信息普遍存在且有害，特别是那些歪曲或误解科学发现的声明难以识别。

Method: 使用检索增强生成(RAG)产生合成谬误样本，然后用这些样本微调大语言模型。

Result: 微调模型相比基线有显著准确率提升，LLaMA 3.1 8B模型在MISSCI测试集上F1分数绝对提升超过35%。

Conclusion: 即使计算资源有限，引入合成谬误数据增强有限标注资源，也能显著提升LLM在真实世界科学错误信息分类任务中的零样本性能。

Abstract: Health-related misinformation is very prevalent and potentially harmful. It
is difficult to identify, especially when claims distort or misinterpret
scientific findings. We investigate the impact of synthetic data generation and
lightweight fine-tuning techniques on the ability of large language models
(LLMs) to recognize fallacious arguments using the MISSCI dataset and
framework. In this work, we propose MisSynth, a pipeline that applies
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce synthetic fallacy samples,
which are then used to fine-tune an LLM model. Our results show substantial
accuracy gains with fine-tuned models compared to vanilla baselines. For
instance, the LLaMA 3.1 8B fine-tuned model achieved an over 35% F1-score
absolute improvement on the MISSCI test split over its vanilla baseline. We
demonstrate that introducing synthetic fallacy data to augment limited
annotated resources can significantly enhance zero-shot LLM classification
performance on real-world scientific misinformation tasks, even with limited
computational resources. The code and synthetic dataset are available on
https://github.com/mxpoliakov/MisSynth.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于交互的自动团队构建框架，通过分析模型间对话的语义连贯性构建语言模型图，使用社区检测发现协同模型集群，无需先验知识即可组建高效的多智能体LLM团队。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体方法虽有望超越单一模型能力，但成功依赖于协同团队组成。由于大多数模型的不透明性，难以了解其内部特性以进行有效协作，因此需要自动化的团队构建方法。

Method: 构建语言模型图来映射模型间关系（基于成对对话的语义连贯性），然后应用社区检测识别协同模型集群。无需模型内部架构、训练数据或任务表现的先验知识。

Result: 实验表明该方法能发现功能连贯的模型组，反映其潜在专业化。特定主题引导的对话识别出的协同团队在下游基准测试中优于随机基线，与基于已知模型专业化的手动策划团队准确率相当。

Conclusion: 为自动化设计协作多智能体LLM团队提供了新的基础，证明了基于交互的团队构建方法的有效性。

Abstract: While a multi-agent approach based on large language models (LLMs) represents
a promising strategy to surpass the capabilities of single models, its success
is critically dependent on synergistic team composition. However, forming
optimal teams is a significant challenge, as the inherent opacity of most
models obscures the internal characteristics necessary for effective
collaboration. In this paper, we propose an interaction-centric framework for
automatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including
their internal architectures, training data, or task performances. Our method
constructs a "language model graph" that maps relationships between models from
the semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, and then applies community
detection to identify synergistic model clusters. Our experiments with diverse
LLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent
groups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with
specific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines
on downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of
manually-curated teams based on known model specializations. Our findings
provide a new basis for the automated design of collaborative multi-agent LLM
teams.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI方法在科学工作流程中的使用增加，研究者希望利用语篇层面的信息为AI生成的科学主张寻找支持证据，而推断科学写作中的语篇结构是实现这一目标的第一步。

Method: 使用预训练语言模型和大语言模型方法进行语篇关系分类，特别关注科学出版物这一较少研究的领域，并研究上下文（定义为语篇结构）如何帮助该任务。

Result: 实验表明，基于语篇结构定义的上下文通常对语篇关系分类任务有帮助，并分析了哪些科学语篇关系类型可能从上下文中获益最多。

Conclusion: 上下文信息在科学语篇关系分类中具有重要作用，特别是对某些特定类型的科学语篇关系，这为使用语篇层面信息支持AI生成的科学主张提供了基础。

Abstract: With the increasing use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to
support science workflows, we are interested in the use of discourse-level
information to find supporting evidence for AI generated scientific claims. A
first step towards this objective is to examine the task of inferring discourse
structure in scientific writing.
  In this work, we present a preliminary investigation of pretrained language
model (PLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) approaches for Discourse Relation
Classification (DRC), focusing on scientific publications, an under-studied
genre for this task. We examine how context can help with the DRC task, with
our experiments showing that context, as defined by discourse structure, is
generally helpful. We also present an analysis of which scientific discourse
relation types might benefit most from context.

TL;DR: OmniEduBench是一个全面的中文教育基准测试，包含24.602K高质量问答对，涵盖知识和素养两个维度，共61个学科和11种题型。实验显示当前LLM在教育领域仍有较大提升空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM和基准测试主要关注知识维度，忽视了教育场景中重要的素养能力评估，且在中文语境下缺乏多样性。

Method: 构建OmniEduBench基准，包含24.602K问答对，分为知识维度(18.121K)和素养维度(6.481K)，各细分为6个类别，涵盖61个学科和11种题型。

Result: 在11个主流LLM上的实验显示：知识维度仅Gemini-2.5 Pro超过60%准确率；素养维度最佳模型QWQ仍比人类智能低近30%。

Conclusion: LLM在教育应用中仍有显著提升空间，OmniEduBench为全面评估LLM教育能力提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), various LLM-based
works have been widely applied in educational fields. However, most existing
LLMs and their benchmarks focus primarily on the knowledge dimension, largely
neglecting the evaluation of cultivation capabilities that are essential for
real-world educational scenarios. Additionally, current benchmarks are often
limited to a single subject or question type, lacking sufficient diversity.
This issue is particularly prominent within the Chinese context. To address
this gap, we introduce OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational
benchmark. OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs.
The data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge
dimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K
entries, respectively. Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained
categories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and
20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of
question formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid
foundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education.
Extensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs
reveal a clear performance gap. In the knowledge dimension, only Gemini-2.5 Pro
surpassed 60\% accuracy, while in the cultivation dimension, the
best-performing model, QWQ, still trailed human intelligence by nearly 30\%.
These results highlight the substantial room for improvement and underscore the
challenges of applying LLMs in education.

TL;DR: SSLC方法结合稀疏优化和低秩逼近来压缩大语言模型，无需额外训练即可实现50%压缩且性能无损，达到1.63倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然性能优异，但部署受到带宽和计算需求的限制。现有的剪枝和低秩逼近方法各自表现良好，但它们的协同作用尚未充分探索。

Method: 基于理论分析，将低秩逼近和稀疏优化统一为一个问题，并通过迭代优化算法求解，形成协同稀疏和低秩压缩方法。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen2.5模型(7B-70B)上的实验表明，SSLC无需额外训练步骤，始终优于单独方法，达到最先进结果。Qwen2.5压缩50%无性能损失，至少1.63倍加速。

Conclusion: SSLC为高效LLM部署提供了实用解决方案，成功结合了稀疏和低秩方法的优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
language comprehension and generation; however, their widespread adoption is
constrained by substantial bandwidth and computational demands. While pruning
and low-rank approximation have each demonstrated promising performance
individually, their synergy for LLMs remains underexplored. We introduce
\underline{S}ynergistic \underline{S}parse and \underline{L}ow-Rank
\underline{C}ompression (SSLC) methods for LLMs, which leverages the strengths
of both techniques: low-rank approximation compresses the model by retaining
its essential structure with minimal information loss, whereas sparse
optimization eliminates non-essential weights, preserving those crucial for
generalization. Based on theoretical analysis, we first formulate the low-rank
approximation and sparse optimization as a unified problem and solve it by
iterative optimization algorithm. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models
(7B-70B) show that SSLC, without any additional training steps, consistently
surpasses standalone methods, achieving state-of-the-arts results. Notably,
SSLC compresses Qwen2.5 by 50\% with no performance drop and achieves at least
1.63$\times$ speedup, offering a practical solution for efficient LLM
deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前领域专用LLM存在的透明度低、微调成本高、提示工程复杂、跨领域结果不一致以及高计算需求带来的环境负面影响等问题。

Method: BNLF框架将FinBERT、RoBERTa和BERTweet三个LLM的情感预测作为概率节点，在贝叶斯网络中进行后期融合。

Result: 在三个具有不同语言和上下文特征的人工标注金融语料库上评估，BNLF相比基线LLM实现了约6%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: BNLF框架对数据集变异性具有鲁棒性，证明了概率融合在可解释情感分类中的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, with an increasing number
of domain-specific variants tailored for specialised tasks. However, these
models often lack transparency and explainability, can be costly to fine-tune,
require substantial prompt engineering, yield inconsistent results across
domains, and impose significant adverse environmental impact due to their high
computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Bayesian
network LLM fusion (BNLF) framework, which integrates predictions from three
LLMs, including FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet, through a probabilistic
mechanism for sentiment analysis. BNLF performs late fusion by modelling the
sentiment predictions from multiple LLMs as probabilistic nodes within a
Bayesian network. Evaluated across three human-annotated financial corpora with
distinct linguistic and contextual characteristics, BNLF demonstrates
consistent gains of about six percent in accuracy over the baseline LLMs,
underscoring its robustness to dataset variability and the effectiveness of
probabilistic fusion for interpretable sentiment classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确定多个LLM代理的集成是否能比单一LLM提供更可靠的像素级AI分诊工具评估。

Method: 使用29,766个非对比CT头部检查数据，通过8个开源LLM模型和GPT-4o分析放射学报告，使用多轮提示评估颅内出血存在情况，并手动审查1,726个示例。

Result: Llama3.3:70b和GPT-4o表现最佳(AUC=0.78)。LLM集成（Full-9、Top-3、Consensus）的MCC值均优于单一GPT-4o，且集成之间无显著差异。

Conclusion: 中等至大型开源LLM的集成提供了比单一LLM更一致和可靠的方法，用于临床AI分诊工具的回顾性评估。

Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if an ensemble of
multiple LLM agents could be used collectively to provide a more reliable
assessment of a pixel-based AI triage tool than a single LLM.
  Methods: 29,766 non-contrast CT head exams from fourteen hospitals were
processed by a commercial intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) AI detection tool.
Radiology reports were analyzed by an ensemble of eight open-source LLM models
and a HIPAA compliant internal version of GPT-4o using a single multi-shot
prompt that assessed for presence of ICH. 1,726 examples were manually
reviewed. Performance characteristics of the eight open-source models and
consensus were compared to GPT-4o. Three ideal consensus LLM ensembles were
tested for rating the performance of the triage tool.
  Results: The cohort consisted of 29,766 head CTs exam-report pairs. The
highest AUC performance was achieved with llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AUC= 0.78).
The average precision was highest for Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AP=0.75 & 0.76).
Llama3.3:70b had the highest F1 score (0.81) and recall (0.85), greater
precision (0.78), specificity (0.72), and MCC (0.57). Using MCC (95% CI) the
ideal combination of LLMs were: Full-9 Ensemble 0.571 (0.552-0.591), Top-3
Ensemble 0.558 (0.537-0.579), Consensus 0.556 (0.539-0.574), and GPT4o 0.522
(0.500-0.543). No statistically significant differences were observed between
Top-3, Full-9, and Consensus (p > 0.05).
  Conclusion: An ensemble of medium to large sized open-source LLMs provides a
more consistent and reliable method to derive a ground truth retrospective
evaluation of a clinical AI triage tool over a single LLM alone.

TL;DR: 对CORE-KG框架进行消融研究，量化其两个关键组件（指代消解和结构化提示）在减少节点重复和噪声方面的独立贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律案件文档通常是非结构化、词汇密集且充满模糊或变化指代的，这给自动知识图谱构建带来挑战。现有LLM方法仍会产生噪声大、碎片化的图谱，存在节点重复问题。

Method: 通过系统消融研究，分别移除CORE-KG框架中的指代消解模块和结构化提示，量化这两个组件对减少节点重复和噪声的贡献。

Result: 移除指代消解导致节点重复增加28.32%，噪声节点增加4.32%；移除结构化提示导致节点重复增加4.34%，噪声节点增加73.33%。

Conclusion: 结构化提示对减少噪声节点效果显著，指代消解对减少节点重复至关重要，为设计稳健的LLM法律文本提取管道提供了实证依据。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer critical insights but are often unstructured,
lexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, which pose
significant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. While
recent LLM-based approaches improve over static templates, they still generate
noisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to the absence of guided
extraction and coreference resolution. The recently proposed CORE-KG framework
addresses these limitations by integrating a type-aware coreference module and
domain-guided structured prompts, significantly reducing node duplication and
legal noise. In this work, we present a systematic ablation study of CORE-KG to
quantify the individual contributions of its two key components. Our results
show that removing coreference resolution results in a 28.32% increase in node
duplication and a 4.32% increase in noisy nodes, while removing structured
prompts leads to a 4.34% increase in node duplication and a 73.33% increase in
noisy nodes. These findings offer empirical insights for designing robust
LLM-based pipelines for extracting structured representations from complex
legal texts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希伯来语未变音文本存在高度歧义性，影响发音准确性和语义理解。现有机器学习方法虽有进步，但仍需更有效的变音符号恢复方案。

Method: 将变音恢复构建为词级零样本分类问题，使用希伯来视觉语言模型将未变音文本作为图像处理，从动态生成的候选集中选择最合适的变音模式。

Result: 在正确变音形式包含在候选集中的"oracle"设置下，系统达到高准确率。通过架构优化和训练方法改进，显著提升了系统的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 视觉表征在希伯来语自动变音符号恢复方面具有巨大潜力，能够在不依赖复杂显式语言分析的情况下有效执行变音任务。

Abstract: Diacritics restoration in Hebrew is a fundamental task for ensuring accurate
word pronunciation and disambiguating textual meaning. Despite the language's
high degree of ambiguity when unvocalized, recent machine learning approaches
have significantly advanced performance on this task.
  In this work, we present DIVRIT, a novel system for Hebrew diacritization
that frames the task as a zero-shot classification problem. Our approach
operates at the word level, selecting the most appropriate diacritization
pattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set,
conditioned on the surrounding textual context. A key innovation of DIVRIT is
its use of a Hebrew Visual Language Model, which processes undiacritized text
as an image, allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within the
input's vector representation.
  Through a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations, we
demonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying
on complex, explicit linguistic analysis. Notably, in an ``oracle'' setting
where the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided
candidates, DIVRIT achieves a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, strategic
architectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield
significant improvements in the system's overall generalization capabilities.
These findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for
accurate and automated Hebrew diacritization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文发现Transformer语言模型中的线性关系解码器不是编码特定关系，而是提取重复的粗粒度语义属性，这解释了它们的高度可压缩性和有限的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展Hernandez等人[2023]的单关系发现，系统研究多关系解码器的组织结构，解释其高度可压缩性的原因。

Method: 使用简单的三阶张量网络压缩关系解码器集合，开发交叉评估协议分析解码器间的语义重叠。

Result: 关系解码器集合可被高度压缩而不显著损失精度，解码器提取的是重复的语义属性而非特定关系。

Conclusion: Transformer语言模型中的线性关系解码本质上是基于属性的，而非关系特定的。

Abstract: This paper investigates the structure of linear operators introduced in
Hernandez et al. [2023] that decode specific relational facts in transformer
language models. We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of
relations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such
collections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3
tensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this
surprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we
apply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our
results reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but
extract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital
city and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This
property-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and
highlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically
close. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer
language models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.

TL;DR: 本文提出了InfoFlow框架来解决强化学习中奖励密度低的问题，通过子问题分解、失败引导提示和双智能体精炼三种方法提高探索效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在深度搜索场景中，强化学习面临奖励密度低的问题，智能体需要付出大量探索成本却只能获得稀疏的最终奖励，这阻碍了RLVR方法的应用。

Method: InfoFlow框架包含三个核心组件：1）子问题分解：将长程任务分解以分配过程奖励；2）失败引导提示：向停滞轨迹注入纠正指导；3）双智能体精炼：使用双智能体架构减轻深度探索的认知负担。

Result: 在多个智能体搜索基准测试中，InfoFlow显著优于强基线方法，使轻量级LLM能够达到与先进专有LLM相当的性能。

Conclusion: InfoFlow通过提高奖励密度有效解决了深度搜索中的探索效率问题，为强化学习在复杂任务中的应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for enhancing agentic deep search. However, its application is often hindered
by low \textbf{Reward Density} in deep search scenarios, where agents expend
significant exploratory costs for infrequent and often null final rewards. In
this paper, we formalize this challenge as the \textbf{Reward Density
Optimization} problem, which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of
exploration cost. This paper introduce \textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic
framework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \textbf{Subproblem
decomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards,
thereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \textbf{Failure-guided hints}:
injecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the
probability of successful outcomes. 3) \textbf{Dual-agent refinement}:
employing a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep
exploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively
compresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration
cost and increasing the overall reward density. We evaluate InfoFlow on
multiple agentic search benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms strong
baselines, enabling lightweight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to
advanced proprietary LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant inference latency challenges
stemming from their autoregressive design and large size. To address this,
speculative decoding emerges as a solution, enabling the simultaneous
generation and validation of multiple tokens. While recent approaches like
EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 improve speculative decoding using dynamic tree structures,
they often neglect the impact of crucial system variables such as GPU devices
and batch sizes.
  Therefore, we introduce a new dynamic tree decoding approach called CAST that
takes into account inference costs, including factors such as GPU
configurations and batch sizes, to dynamically refine the tree structure.
Through comprehensive experimentation across six diverse tasks and utilizing
six distinct LLMs, our methodology demonstrates remarkable results, achieving
speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding methods. Moreover, it
generally outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques from 5% to 20%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SlideAgent是一个用于理解多模态、多页面、多布局文档（特别是幻灯片）的智能代理框架，通过三级专业化代理实现细粒度推理，显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前系统在处理复杂的多页面视觉文档时存在困难，特别是在对元素和页面进行细粒度推理方面，而大语言模型为文档理解提供了新的机会。

Method: SlideAgent采用专业化代理框架，将推理分解为全局、页面和元素三个层级，构建结构化、查询无关的表示，捕捉整体主题和详细视觉/文本线索。

Result: 广泛实验表明，SlideAgent相比专有模型整体提升7.9%，相比开源模型整体提升9.8%。

Conclusion: SlideAgent通过多级专业化代理框架，有效解决了多页面视觉文档的细粒度推理问题，显著提升了文档理解性能。

Abstract: Multi-page visual documents such as manuals, brochures, presentations, and
posters convey key information through layout, colors, icons, and cross-slide
references. While large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities in document
understanding, current systems struggle with complex, multi-page visual
documents, particularly in fine-grained reasoning over elements and pages. We
introduce SlideAgent, a versatile agentic framework for understanding
multi-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout documents, especially slide decks.
SlideAgent employs specialized agents and decomposes reasoning into three
specialized levels-global, page, and element-to construct a structured,
query-agnostic representation that captures both overarching themes and
detailed visual or textual cues. During inference, SlideAgent selectively
activates specialized agents for multi-level reasoning and integrates their
outputs into coherent, context-aware answers. Extensive experiments show that
SlideAgent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary (+7.9
overall) and open-source models (+9.8 overall).

*Biao Zhang,Yong Cheng,Siamak Shakeri,Xinyi Wang,Min Ma,Orhan Firat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文重新审视编码器-解码器架构的大语言模型(RedLLM)，与当前主流的仅解码器模型(DecLLM)进行全面的缩放对比分析，发现RedLLM具有竞争力的缩放性能和推理效率优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM研究快速转向仅解码器架构，但缺乏从缩放角度对编码器-解码器模型的系统比较，可能忽视了其潜在优势。

Method: 使用前缀语言建模预训练RedLLM，应用仅解码器模型的现代技术，在150M到8B参数规模上与因果语言建模预训练的DecLLM进行对比。

Result: RedLLM展现出有竞争力的缩放特性和上下文长度外推能力，指令微调后在多个下游任务上表现相当甚至更好，且推理效率显著更高。

Conclusion: 编码器-解码器架构在LLM发展中仍有重要价值，值得重新审视以开发更强大高效的模型。

Abstract: Recent large language model (LLM) research has undergone an architectural
shift from encoder-decoder modeling to nowadays the dominant decoder-only
modeling. This rapid transition, however, comes without a rigorous comparative
analysis especially \textit{from the scaling perspective}, raising concerns
that the potential of encoder-decoder models may have been overlooked. To fill
this gap, we revisit encoder-decoder LLM (RedLLM), enhancing it with recent
recipes from decoder-only LLM (DecLLM). We conduct a comprehensive comparison
between RedLLM, pretrained with prefix language modeling (LM), and DecLLM,
pretrained with causal LM, at different model scales, ranging from $\sim$150M
to $\sim$8B. Using RedPajama V1 (1.6T tokens) for pretraining and FLAN for
instruction tuning, our experiments show that RedLLM produces compelling
scaling properties and surprisingly strong performance. While DecLLM is overall
more compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM demonstrates comparable scaling
and context length extrapolation capabilities. After instruction tuning, RedLLM
achieves comparable and even better results on various downstream tasks while
enjoying substantially better inference efficiency. We hope our findings could
inspire more efforts on re-examining RedLLM, unlocking its potential for
developing powerful and efficient LLMs.

TL;DR: Evontree框架利用少量高质量本体规则，无需大量外部数据就能系统提取、验证和增强LLMs中的领域知识，在医疗QA基准测试中显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗等数据敏感领域，缺乏高质量领域特定训练语料阻碍了LLMs的专业化应用，而领域专家已将领域知识提炼成本体规则。

Method: Evontree从原始模型中提取领域本体，使用两个核心本体规则检测不一致性，并通过自蒸馏微调强化精炼后的知识。

Result: 在Llama3-8B-Instruct和Med42-v2上的医疗QA基准测试中，相比未修改模型和领先监督基线，准确率提升最高达3.7%。

Conclusion: 该方法在LLMs的低资源领域适应中展现出有效性、高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities
across multiple domains by leveraging massive pre-training and curated
fine-tuning data. However, in data-sensitive fields such as healthcare, the
lack of high-quality, domain-specific training corpus hinders LLMs' adaptation
for specialized applications. Meanwhile, domain experts have distilled domain
wisdom into ontology rules, which formalize relationships among concepts and
ensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories. Viewing LLMs as
implicit repositories of human knowledge, we propose Evontree, a novel
framework that leverages a small set of high-quality ontology rules to
systematically extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge within LLMs,
without requiring extensive external datasets. Specifically, Evontree extracts
domain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core
ontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled
fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with
Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both
unmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7%
improvement in accuracy. These results confirm the effectiveness, efficiency,
and robustness of our approach for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs.

TL;DR: Kimi Linear是一种混合线性注意力架构，首次在公平比较中超越全注意力机制，在短上下文、长上下文和强化学习场景中均表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统注意力机制在长序列处理时计算复杂度高、内存消耗大的问题，同时保持或提升模型性能。

Method: 提出Kimi Delta Attention (KDA)模块，扩展Gated DeltaNet并采用更细粒度的门控机制；使用专门的块状算法和Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)过渡矩阵变体来提高硬件效率。

Result: 3B激活参数的Kimi Linear模型在所有评估任务中显著优于全MLA，KV缓存使用减少75%，1M上下文解码吞吐量提升6倍。

Conclusion: Kimi Linear可以作为全注意力架构的直接替代品，提供更优越的性能和效率，特别是在处理长输入和输出序列时。

Abstract: We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture that, for
the first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across
various scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement
learning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an
expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a
finer-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited
finite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware
efficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)
transition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the
general DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical
delta rule.
  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total
parameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention
(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear
outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while
reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding
throughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be
a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior
performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output
lengths.
  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM
implementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model
checkpoints.

TL;DR: AutoDeco是一个新型架构，通过在标准transformer上添加轻量级头部，让模型能够动态预测上下文特定的温度值和top-p值，实现真正的端到端生成，无需手动调整解码超参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs的"端到端"标签是个误称，因为它们依赖非可微的解码过程，需要手动调整温度、top-p等超参数，这个过程既繁琐又需要专业知识。

Method: 在标准transformer架构上添加轻量级头部，在每个生成步骤中动态预测上下文特定的温度值和top-p值，同时预测下一个token的logits，将解码转变为参数化的token级过程。

Result: 在八个基准测试中，AutoDeco不仅显著优于默认解码策略，而且达到了与通过"测试集黑客"获得的oracle调优基线相当的性能，这是任何静态方法的实际上限。

Conclusion: AutoDeco实现了真正的端到端生成，无需手动调参，并展现出基于指令的解码控制能力，能够根据自然语言命令调整采样策略，为可引导和交互式LLM解码开辟了新范式。

Abstract: The "end-to-end" label for LLMs is a misnomer. In practice, they depend on a
non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of
hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a
novel architecture that enables truly "end-to-end" generation by learning to
control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with
lightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific
temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach
transforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model
to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.
  Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that
AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but
also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from
"hacking the test set"-a practical upper bound for any static method.
Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding
control: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g.,
"generate with low randomness") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p
on a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive
LLM decoding.

TL;DR: 研究揭示了大语言模型在训练过程中价值对齐的动态机制，发现监督微调阶段主要确立模型价值观，而后续的偏好优化很少重新调整这些价值观。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在社会中扮演越来越重要的角色，需要研究它们如何学习并符合人类价值体系，现有研究主要关注完全训练好的模型，忽略了训练动态过程。

Method: 使用Llama-3和Qwen-3不同规模的模型，结合流行的监督微调(SFT)和偏好优化数据集与算法，通过合成偏好数据集进行受控实验。

Result: SFT阶段一般确立模型的价值取向，后续偏好优化很少重新调整这些价值观；不同的偏好优化算法即使使用相同偏好数据也会产生不同的价值对齐结果。

Conclusion: 研究为理解模型在训练过程中如何学习价值观提供了可操作的见解，有助于改进数据筛选、模型选择和偏好优化算法，以提升模型与人类价值观的对齐程度。

Abstract: As LLMs occupy an increasingly important role in society, they are more and
more confronted with questions that require them not only to draw on their
general knowledge but also to align with certain human value systems.
Therefore, studying the alignment of LLMs with human values has become a
crucial field of inquiry. Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the
alignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which
models learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at
which stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's
post-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training
algorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts
during training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different
sizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization
datasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a
model's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these
values. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables
controlled manipulation of values, we find that different preference
optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when
preference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into
how values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,
as well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization
to improve model alignment to human values.

TL;DR: AMO-Bench是一个高级数学推理基准，包含50道奥林匹克竞赛难度或更高的人类编写问题，旨在评估大型语言模型的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学竞赛基准对顶级LLMs的评估效果下降，存在性能饱和问题，需要更具挑战性的基准来推动模型发展。

Method: 创建50道经过专家交叉验证、达到IMO难度标准的原创问题，仅要求最终答案以便自动评分，避免数据记忆导致的性能泄漏。

Result: 在26个LLMs上的实验结果显示，最佳模型准确率仅为52.4%，大多数模型低于40%，但发现了测试时计算增加时的有希望的扩展趋势。

Conclusion: AMO-Bench突显了当前LLMs在数学推理方面的显著改进空间，为推进语言模型推理能力的研究提供了有效基准。

Abstract: We present AMO-Bench, an Advanced Mathematical reasoning benchmark with
Olympiad level or even higher difficulty, comprising 50 human-crafted problems.
Existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for
evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for
assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To
address this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50
problems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original
problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization.
Moreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a
proof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental
results across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model
achieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%.
Beyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising
scaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results
highlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in
current LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into
advancing the reasoning abilities of language models.

Motivation: 随着编码代理在大型代码库中的部署增加，需要自动设计具有挑战性的代码库级评估。

Method: 给编码LLM提供完整代码库和特定入口点，要求生成仅包含必要组件的最小化文件来复现相同命令输出。

Result: 当前最先进模型在可靠解决Gistify任务方面表现不佳，特别是对于执行轨迹较长的任务。

Conclusion: Gistify任务需要代码库结构理解、执行流建模和大代码补丁生成能力，现有模型在这方面仍有困难。

Abstract: As coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases, the need to
automatically design challenging, codebase-level evaluation is central. We
propose Gistify, a task where a coding LLM must create a single, minimal,
self-contained file that can reproduce a specific functionality of a codebase.
The coding LLM is given full access to a codebase along with a specific
entrypoint (e.g., a python command), and the generated file must replicate the
output of the same command ran under the full codebase, while containing only
the essential components necessary to execute the provided command. Success on
Gistify requires both structural understanding of the codebase, accurate
modeling of its execution flow as well as the ability to produce potentially
large code patches. Our findings show that current state-of-the-art models
struggle to reliably solve Gistify tasks, especially ones with long executions
traces.

*Yiren Tong,Panagiotis Tsoutsanis*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 提出了一种多维任意阶混合重构框架，结合线性重构效率和非线性重构鲁棒性，通过先验检测策略仅在需要时激活非线性方法，在保持精度的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高分辨率格式在计算效率和鲁棒性之间存在权衡，线性方法高效但不稳定，非线性方法鲁棒但计算昂贵。需要一种智能混合方法，在平滑区域使用高效线性重构，在非平滑区域使用鲁棒非线性方法。

Method: 结合CWENOZ和MOOD范式，引入重新设计的数值容许检测器(NAD)，将流场分为平滑、弱非平滑和不连续区域，分别采用高阶线性方法、CWENOZ和二阶MUSCL进行重构。

Result: 在UCNS3D求解器中实现，二维和三维基准测试表明在平滑区域保持设计精度，在激波主导流场中显著提高鲁棒性，相比同等阶数CWENOZ方案在3D可压缩湍流中实现高达2.5倍加速。

Conclusion: 这种混合方法通过平衡效率、鲁棒性和可靠性，使高阶精度更接近工业级CFD应用。

Abstract: We present a multi-dimensional, arbitrary-order hybrid reconstruction
framework for compressible flows on unstructured meshes. The method advances
high-resolution schemes by combining the efficiency of linear reconstruction
with the robustness of nonlinear formulations, activated only when needed
through a novel a priori detection strategy. This minimizes the use of costly
Compact Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (CWENOZ) or Monotonic
Upstream-centered Scheme for Conservation Laws (MUSCL) reconstructions,
reducing computational cost without compromising accuracy or stability. The
framework merges CWENOZ and the Multi-dimensional Optimal Order Detection
(MOOD) paradigm while introducing a redesigned Numerical Admissibility Detector
(NAD) that classifies the local flow into smooth, weakly non-smooth, and
discontinuous regions in a single step. Each region is then reconstructed using
an optimal method: a high-order linear scheme in smooth areas, CWENOZ in weakly
non-smooth zones, and a second-order MUSCL near discontinuities. This targeted
a priori allocation preserves high-order accuracy where possible and ensures
stable, non-oscillatory behavior near shocks and steep gradients. Implemented
within the open-source unstructured finite-volume solver UCNS3D, the framework
supports arbitrary-order reconstructions on mixed-element meshes. Extensive
two- and three-dimensional benchmarks confirm that it retains the designed
accuracy in smooth regions while greatly improving robustness in
shock-dominated flows. Thanks to the reduced frequency of nonlinear
reconstructions, the method achieves up to 2.5x speed-up over a CWENOZ scheme
of equal order in 3D compressible turbulence. This hybrid approach thus brings
high-order accuracy closer to industrial-scale CFD through its balance of
efficiency, robustness, and reliability.

Motivation: 为了解决变系数椭圆型偏微分方程在大规模计算中的效率问题，特别是处理稠密线性系统时的计算复杂度挑战。

Conclusion: 该方法为求解大规模变系数椭圆型偏微分方程提供了一种高效且条件良好的数值解法，特别适用于薄子域上的稀疏直接求解器。

Abstract: A domain decomposition method for the solution of general
variable-coefficient elliptic partial differential equations on regular domains
is introduced. The method is based on tessellating the domain into overlapping
thin slabs or shells, and then explicitly forming a reduced linear system that
connects the different domains. Rank-structure ('H-matrix structure') is
exploited to handle the large dense blocks that arise in the reduced linear
system. Importantly, the formulation used is well-conditioned, as it converges
to a second kind Fredholm equation as the precision in the local solves is
refined. Moreover, the dense blocks that arise are far more data-sparse than in
existing formulations, leading to faster and more efficient H-matrix
arithmetic. To form the reduced linear system, black-box randomized compression
is used, taking full advantage of the fact that sparse direct solvers are
highly efficient on the thin sub-domains. Numerical experiments demonstrate
that our solver can handle oscillatory 2D and 3D problems with as many as 28
million degrees of freedom.

Motivation: 现有的一维f-EFG求解器受限于简单的一维线几何，无法充分展示无网格方法在求解分数阶微分方程方面的真正效能。需要开发能够处理复杂二维不规则域的方法。

Method: 采用二维移动最小二乘近似子（2D MLS），特别适用于从节点值近似分数阶导数。该方法能够处理传统有限元方法难以处理的复杂不规则二维域。

Result: 开发的2D f-EFG求解器成功应用于方形和圆形板的非局部弹性问题，验证了与文献中基准结果的一致性。该方法克服了有限元方法的高计算成本、网格生成困难以及在不规则域中精度降低等关键缺点。

Conclusion: 虽然示例聚焦于非局部弹性，但该数值方法可扩展到多尺度建模、多物理场耦合、异常扩散和复杂材料行为等分数阶导数的多样化应用中。

Abstract: This study presents a meshfree two-dimensional fractional-order Element-Free
Galerkin (2D f-EFG) method as a viable alternative to conventional mesh-based
FEM for a numerical solution of (spatial) fractional-order differential
equations (FDEs). The previously developed one-dimensional f-EFG solver offers
a limited demonstration of the true efficacy of EFG formulations for FDEs, as
it is restricted to simple 1D line geometries. In contrast, the 2D f-EFG solver
proposed and developed here effectively demonstrates the potential of meshfree
approaches for solving FDEs. The proposed solver can handle complex and
irregular 2D domains that are challenging for mesh-based methods. As an
example, the developed framework is employed to investigate nonlocal elasticity
governed by fractional-order constitutive relations in a square and circular
plate. Furthermore, the proposed approach mitigates key drawbacks of FEM,
including high computational cost, mesh generation, and reduced accuracy in
irregular domains. The 2D f-EFG employs 2D Moving Least Squares (MLS)
approximants, which are particularly effective in approximating fractional
derivatives from nodal values. The 2D f-EFG solver is employed here for the
numerical solution of fractional-order linear and nonlinear partial
differential equations corresponding to the nonlocal elastic response of a
plate. The solver developed here is validated with the benchmark results
available in the literature. While the example chosen here focuses on nonlocal
elasticity, the numerical method can be extended for diverse applications of
fractional-order derivatives in multiscale modeling, multiphysics coupling,
anomalous diffusion, and complex material behavior.

Motivation: 传统并行时间方法在求解随机初值问题时，由于初始猜测质量差，导致收敛速度缓慢，需要提高计算效率。

Method: 使用KL展开对高维随机参数场进行低维参数化，构建gPC谱代理模型快速预测解场，将其作为初始值改进parareal迭代的初始精度。

Result: 数值实验表明KLE-CGC保持与原算法相同的收敛阶，同时显著减少迭代次数并提高并行可扩展性。

Conclusion: KLE-CGC框架在保持标准parareal算法理论收敛率的同时，有效提升了随机问题求解的计算效率。

Abstract: This paper is dedicated to enhancing the computational efficiency of
traditional parallel-in-time methods for solving stochastic initial-value
problems. The standard parareal algorithm often suffers from slow convergence
when applied to problems with stochastic inputs, primarily due to the poor
quality of the initial guess. To address this issue, we propose a hybrid
parallel algorithm, termed KLE-CGC, which integrates the Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve
(KL) expansion with the coarse grid correction (CGC). The method first employs
the KL expansion to achieve a low-dimensional parameterization of
high-dimensional stochastic parameter fields. Subsequently, a generalized
Polynomial Chaos (gPC) spectral surrogate model is constructed to enable rapid
prediction of the solution field. Utilizing this prediction as the initial
value significantly improves the initial accuracy for the parareal iterations.
A rigorous convergence analysis is provided, establishing that the proposed
framework retains the same theoretical convergence rate as the standard
parareal algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate that KLE-CGC maintains
the same convergence order as the original algorithm while substantially
reducing the number of iterations and improving parallel scalability.

third-order accurate numerical scheme is developed by building upon a
second-order method \cite{CaiChenWangXie2022} and leveraging its efficiency.
This method boasts two key advantages: first, it only involves solving linear
systems with constant coefficients, enabling the use of fast solvers and thus
significantly enhancing numerical efficiency over existing first or
second-order approaches. Second, it achieves third-order temporal accuracy and
fourth-order spatial accuracy, while being unconditionally stable for large
damping parameters. Numerical tests in 1D and 3D scenarios confirm both its
third-order accuracy and efficiency gains. When large damping parameters are
present, the method demonstrates unconditional stability and reproduces
physically plausible structures. For domain wall dynamics simulations, it
captures the linear relationship between wall velocity and both the damping
parameter and external magnetic field, outperforming lower-order methods in
this regard.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 提出一种模块化框架，通过DeepONet插值稀疏测量数据，结合直接采样方法显著改善窄孔径下多源定位精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Helmholtz边界数据在窄孔径下逆源定位的高度不适定和严重欠采样问题，传统方法如直接采样法效果不佳

Method: 1)扩展逆源问题唯一性定理；2)使用DeepONet分支-主干架构插值稀疏测量，将6-10个样本提升为密集合成孔径；3)将超分辨场输入直接采样方法

Result: 单源情况下稀疏数据可达到网格级精度；多源试验中，DeepONet重建数据将定位误差降低约一个数量级，在π/4小孔径下仍有效

Conclusion: 该模块化框架通过解耦插值和反演，提供实用灵活的设计，相比标准基线显著提高了定位精度

Abstract: Inverse source localization from Helmholtz boundary data collected over a
narrow aperture is highly ill-posed and severely undersampled, undermining
classical solvers (e.g., the Direct Sampling Method). We present a modular
framework that significantly improves multi-source localization from extremely
sparse single-frequency measurements. First, we extend a uniqueness theorem for
the inverse source problem, proving that a unique solution is guaranteed under
limited viewing apertures. Second, we employ a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet)
with a branch-trunk architecture to interpolate the sparse measurements,
lifting six to ten samples within the narrow aperture to a sufficiently dense
synthetic aperture. Third, the super-resolved field is fed into the Direct
Sampling Method (DSM). For a single source, we derive an error estimate showing
that sparse data alone can achieve grid-level precision. In two- and
three-source trials, localization from raw sparse measurements is unreliable,
whereas DeepONet-reconstructed data reduce localization error by about an order
of magnitude and remain effective with apertures as small as $\pi/4$. By
decoupling interpolation from inversion, the framework allows the interpolation
and inversion modules to be swapped with neural operators and classical
algorithms, respectively, providing a practical and flexible design that
improves localization accuracy compared with standard baselines.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效数值方法，用于模拟小但有限Ginzburg-Landau参数ε下的二维磁性时间相关Ginzburg-Landau方程，避免直接求解ε尺度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在小的Ginzburg-Landau参数ε和恒定外加磁场条件下，TDGL方程会出现核心尺寸为ε量级的量子化涡旋。当ε趋近于0时，这些涡旋遵循显式ODE系统演化。传统数值方法需要非常精细的网格和时间步长来解析ε尺度，计算成本高昂。

Method: 首先开发了求解极限ODE系统的新数值方法，每个时间步需要求解线性二阶PDE。然后基于这个有限维ODE系统开发数值策略，用于高效模拟无限维TDGL方程，避免直接解析ε尺度。

Result: 提供了几个测试案例的数值示例，并通过数值研究验证了方法的准确性。该方法能够有效处理小但有限ε值的情况，无需使用传统方法所需的精细网格。

Conclusion: 该方法为在恒定外加磁场和小但有限Ginzburg-Landau参数条件下高效模拟TDGL方程提供了一种可行的数值策略，显著降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: This paper deals with the numerical simulation of the 2D magnetic
time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equations in the regime of small but
finite (inverse) Ginzburg-Landau parameter $\epsilon$ and constant (order $1$
in $\epsilon$) applied magnetic field. In this regime, a well-known feature of
the TDGL equation is the appearance of quantized vortices with core size of
order $\epsilon$. Moreover, in the singular limit $\epsilon \searrow 0$, these
vortices evolve according to an explicit ODE system. In this work, we first
introduce a new numerical method for the numerical integration of this limiting
ODE system, which requires to solve a linear second order PDE at each time
step. We also provide a rigorous theoretical justification for this method that
applies to a general class of 2D domains. We then develop and analyze a
numerical strategy based on the finite-dimensional ODE system to efficiently
simulate the infinite-dimensional TDGL equations in the presence of a constant
external magnetic field and for small, but finite, $\epsilon$. This method
allows us to avoid resolving the $\epsilon$-scale when solving the TDGL
equations, where small values of $\epsilon$ typically require very fine meshes
and time steps. We provide numerical examples on a few test cases and justify
the accuracy of the method with numerical investigations.

Conclusion: 局部Hölder正则化能有效提升PINNs求解椭圆型PDEs的性能，为物理信息神经网络的正则化方法提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, local H\"older regularization is incorporated into a
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) framework for solving elliptic partial
differential equations (PDEs). Motivated by the interior regularity properties
of linear elliptic PDEs, a modified loss function is constructed by introducing
local H\"older regularization term. To approximate this term effectively, a
variable-distance discrete sampling strategy is developed. Error estimates are
established to assess the generalization performance of the proposed method.
Numerical experiments on a range of elliptic problems demonstrate notable
improvements in both prediction accuracy and robustness compared to standard
physics-informed neural networks.

Conclusion: 通过Γ-收敛理论成功建立了自适应有限元方法中网格优化的数学基础，为数值计算中的网格自适应策略提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We consider the minimization of integral functionals in one dimension and
their approximation by $r$-adaptive finite elements. Including the grid of the
FEM approximation as a variable in the minimization, we are able to show that
the optimal grid configurations have a well-defined limit when the number of
nodes in the grid is being sent to infinity. This is done by showing that the
suitably renormalized energy functionals possess a limit in the sense of
$\Gamma$-convergence. We provide numerical examples showing the closeness of
the optimal asymptotic mesh obtained as a minimizer of the $\Gamma$-limit to
the optimal finite meshes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电沉积形成的薄膜形态难以控制，特别是在高能量密度下一代金属阳极电池中，电极形状的不可控演化导致无法实现实际循环目标。数学建模是解决这一问题的关键工具。

Method: 引入ESDIB模型，采用LESFEM方法进行空间离散化，结合IMEX Euler方案进行时间积分，数值求解表面运动与物种传输的耦合问题。

Result: 通过六个数值实验验证模型，与实验室电沉积图像对比，结果表明ESDIB框架能够准确捕捉分支和枝晶生长模式。

Conclusion: ESDIB模型为研究能量存储设备中的金属沉积现象提供了一个预测性和物理一致的工具。

Abstract: It is well known that phase formation by electrodeposition yields films of
poorly controllable morphology. This typically leads to a range of
technological issues in many fields of electrochemical technology. Presently, a
particularly relevant case is that of high-energy density next-generation
batteries with metal anodes, that cannot yet reach practical cyclability
targets, owing to uncontrolled elelctrode shape evolution. In this scenario,
mathematical modelling is a key tool to lay the knowledge-base for
materials-science advancements liable to lead to concretely stable battery
material architectures. In this work, we introduce the Evolving Surface DIB
(ESDIB) model, a reaction-diffusion system posed on a dynamically evolving
electrode surface. Unlike previous fixed-surface formulations, the ESDIB model
couples surface evolution to the local concentration of electrochemical
species, allowing the geometry of the electrode itself to adapt in response to
deposition. To handle the challenges related to the coupling between surface
motion and species transport, we numerically solve the system by proposing an
extension of the Lumped Evolving Surface Finite Element Method (LESFEM) for
spatial discretisation, combined with an IMEX Euler scheme for time
integration. The model is validated through six numerical experiments, each
compared with laboratory images of electrodeposition. Results demonstrate that
the ESDIB framework accurately captures branching and dendritic growth,
providing a predictive and physically consistent tool for studying metal
deposition phenomena in energy storage devices.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的GenEO粗空间变体，通过仅在子域边界附近的条带区域求解特征问题，显著降低了设置成本，同时保持了与原始方法相似的系数鲁棒性条件数估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自适应粗空间方法虽然具有鲁棒性，但求解局部特征问题的设置成本过高，可能超过迭代阶段的成本。

Method: 开发了GenEO粗空间的新变体，仅在子域边界连接的条带区域内求解特征问题，而不是在整个子域上求解。

Result: 新方法显著降低了设置成本，同时保持了与原始方法相似的系数鲁棒性条件数估计，但可能需要更大的粗空间。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持鲁棒性的同时有效降低了计算成本，是两水平重叠Schwarz方法的一个实用改进。

Abstract: Coarse spaces are essential to ensure robustness w.r.t. the number of
subdomains in two-level overlapping Schwarz methods. Robustness with respect to
the coefficients of the underlying partial differential equation (PDE) can be
achieved by adaptive (or spectral) coarse spaces involving the solution of
local eigenproblems. The solution of these eigenproblems, although scalable,
entails a large setup cost which may exceed the cost for the iteration phase.
In this paper we present and analyse a new variant of the GenEO (Generalised
Eigenproblems in the Overlap) coarse space which involves solving eigenproblems
only in a strip connected to the boundary of the subdomain. This leads to a
significant reduction of the setup cost while the method satisfies a similar
coefficient-robust condition number estimate as the original method, albeit
with a possibly larger coarse space.

Motivation: 传统方法计算双随机归一化核矩阵的特征值分解成本高昂，需要构建完整的核矩阵，限制了在大规模数据集上的应用。

Method: 使用枢轴部分Cholesky算法构建原始核矩阵的低秩近似，然后基于此计算双随机归一化的近似分解，无需构建完整核矩阵。

Result: 算法成本与训练数据集大小呈线性关系，与低秩近似的秩呈平方关系，相比朴素方法显著降低成本。在从混沌动力学中提取时空模式的应用中表现出良好精度。

Conclusion: 所提出的加速算法能够有效计算双随机归一化核矩阵的近似特征值分解，在保持精度的同时大幅降低计算复杂度，适用于大规模数据集。

Abstract: We develop an accelerated algorithm for computing an approximate eigenvalue
decomposition of bistochastic normalized kernel matrices. Our approach
constructs a low rank approximation of the original kernel matrix by the
pivoted partial Cholesky algorithm and uses it to compute an approximate
decomposition of its bistochastic normalization without requiring the formation
of the full kernel matrix. The cost of the proposed algorithm depends linearly
on the size of the employed training dataset and quadratically on the rank of
the low rank approximation, offering a significant cost reduction compared to
the naive approach. We apply the proposed algorithm to the kernel based
extraction of spatiotemporal patterns from chaotic dynamics, demonstrating its
accuracy while also comparing it with an alternative algorithm consisting of
subsampling and Nystroem extension.

Conclusion: 该方法为蛋白质-配体对接提供了高效的静电相互作用计算框架，可与传统随机或确定性对接技术结合使用。

Abstract: We propose and justify a new approach for fast calculation of the
electrostatic interaction energy of clusters of charged particles in
constrained energy minimization in the framework of rigid protein-ligand
docking. Our ``blind search'' docking technique is based on the low-rank
range-separated (RS) tensor-based representation of the free-space
electrostatic potential of the biomolecule represented on large $n\times
n\times n$ 3D grid. We show that both the collective electrostatic potential of
a complex protein-ligand system and the respective electrostatic interaction
energy can be calculated by tensor techniques in $O(n)$-complexity, such that
the numerical cost for energy calculation only mildly (logarithmically) depends
on the number of particles in the system. Moreover, tensor representation of
the electrostatic potential enables usage of large 3D Cartesian grids (of the
order of $n^3 \sim 10^{12}$), which could allow the accurate modeling of
complexes with several large proteins. In our approach selection of the correct
geometric pose predictions in the localized posing process is based on the
control of van der Waals distance between the target molecular clusters. Here,
we confine ourselves by constrained minimization of the energy functional by
using only fast tensor-based free-space electrostatic energy recalculation for
various rotations and translations of both clusters. Numerical tests of the
electrostatic energy-based ``protein-ligand docking'' algorithm applied to
synthetic and realistic input data present a proof of concept for rather
complex particle configurations. The method may be used in the framework of the
traditional stochastic or deterministic posing/docking techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前国际象棋引擎提供精确但不透明的评估分数（通常以百分兵为单位），这些输出掩盖了单个棋子或模式的贡献。需要一种方法来解释引擎评估背后的具体棋子贡献。

Method: 将棋子视为特征，通过系统性地移除棋子来计算SHAP值，为每个棋子提供加性的贡献度评估，这种方法既忠实于引擎输出又易于人类理解。

Result: 开发了一种能够将国际象棋引擎评估归因于特定棋子的方法，该方法与经典的国际象棋教学理念（通过移除棋子来评估位置）相呼应。

Conclusion: 该方法为可视化、人类训练和引擎比较开辟了新的可能性，并发布了相关代码和数据以促进可解释国际象棋AI的进一步研究。

Abstract: Contemporary chess engines offer precise yet opaque evaluations, typically
expressed as centipawn scores. While effective for decision-making, these
outputs obscure the underlying contributions of individual pieces or patterns.
In this paper, we explore adapting SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to the
domain of chess analysis, aiming to attribute a chess engines evaluation to
specific pieces on the board. By treating pieces as features and systematically
ablating them, we compute additive, per-piece contributions that explain the
engines output in a locally faithful and human-interpretable manner. This
method draws inspiration from classical chess pedagogy, where players assess
positions by mentally removing pieces, and grounds it in modern explainable AI
techniques. Our approach opens new possibilities for visualization, human
training, and engine comparison. We release accompanying code and data to
foster future research in interpretable chess AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM驱动的游戏NPC对话中，约束提示是否真的能改善玩家体验，挑战"更严格的约束必然提升游戏体验"的假设。

Method: 通过语音侦探游戏《The Interview》进行用户研究，比较高低约束提示；然后重新设计混合JSON+RAG框架并进行合成评估。

Result: 发现约束效果具有角色依赖性：面试官NPC获得稳定性，但嫌疑犯NPC失去即兴可信度；约束程度本身对玩家体验无可靠差异。

Conclusion: 提出了符号化支架游戏框架，使用模糊数值边界来在需要时稳定连贯性，同时在需要惊喜的地方保留即兴发挥。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to transform interactive games by
enabling non-player characters (NPCs) to sustain unscripted dialogue. Yet it
remains unclear whether constrained prompts actually improve player experience.
We investigate this question through The Interview, a voice-based detective
game powered by GPT-4o. A within-subjects usability study ($N=10$) compared
high-constraint (HCP) and low-constraint (LCP) prompts, revealing no reliable
experiential differences beyond sensitivity to technical breakdowns. Guided by
these findings, we redesigned the HCP into a hybrid JSON+RAG scaffold and
conducted a synthetic evaluation with an LLM judge, positioned as an
early-stage complement to usability testing. Results uncovered a novel pattern:
scaffolding effects were role-dependent: the Interviewer (quest-giver NPC)
gained stability, while suspect NPCs lost improvisational believability. These
findings overturn the assumption that tighter constraints inherently enhance
play. Extending fuzzy-symbolic scaffolding, we introduce \textit{Symbolically
Scaffolded Play}, a framework in which symbolic structures are expressed as
fuzzy, numerical boundaries that stabilize coherence where needed while
preserving improvisation where surprise sustains engagement.

Conclusion: LLMs可以作为人类思维轨迹的实用代理，使仅标签语料库扩展为思维轨迹增强资源，从而提高LLM评估器的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as raters for evaluation
tasks. However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when
human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking
traces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging
to collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer
thinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a
simple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at
scale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks:
(1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation
guidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods
lead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined
annotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These
results suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise
unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended
into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM
raters.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个两层次框架来解释为什么压缩过程会强制发现因果结构而非表面统计模式。信息论必要性(ITI)建立了生存压力与信息处理需求之间的联系，压缩效率原则(CEP)解释了高效压缩如何通过异常积累机制选择生成性因果模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架都认同压缩对智能的核心作用，但未能具体说明为什么这个过程会强制发现因果结构而不是表面统计模式。本文旨在填补这一理论空白。

Method: 引入两层次框架：信息论必要性(ITI)从进化角度解释生存压力如何导致信息处理需求；压缩效率原则(CEP)从机制上解释高效压缩如何通过异常积累动态选择生成性因果模型。

Result: 该框架产生了可实证检验的预测：压缩效率与分布外泛化相关；异常积累率可区分因果模型和相关模型；分层系统在抽象层上表现出递增效率；生物系统展示了与表征复杂性相关的代谢成本。

Conclusion: ITI和CEP为生物、人工和多尺度系统中的趋同现象提供了统一解释，解决了智能的认知和功能维度，无需诉诸意识或主观经验的假设。

Abstract: Existing frameworks converge on the centrality of compression to intelligence
but leave underspecified why this process enforces the discovery of causal
structure rather than superficial statistical patterns. We introduce a
two-level framework to address this gap. The Information-Theoretic Imperative
(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must
minimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the
evolutionary "why" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.
The Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression
mechanically selects for generative, causal models through
exception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather
than a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:
from survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,
efficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality
alignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or
evolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically
necessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework
yields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as
approach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution
generalization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from
correlational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across
abstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that
track representational complexity. ITI and CEP thereby provide a unified
account of convergence across biological, artificial, and multi-scale systems,
addressing the epistemic and functional dimensions of intelligence without
invoking assumptions about consciousness or subjective experience.

Abstract: Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge,
as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity,
bias, and instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications,
such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the
best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework
for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate
outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance
of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case
studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include
a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two
distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

*Emily Herron,Junqi Yin,Feiyi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SciTrust 2.0是一个评估LLM在科学应用中可信度的框架，涵盖真实性、对抗鲁棒性、科学安全和科学伦理四个维度。评估显示通用行业模型优于科学专用模型，后者在逻辑推理、伦理推理和安全评估方面存在显著缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在科学研究中具有变革潜力，但在高风险环境中的部署引发了可信度担忧，需要系统评估框架来确保其可靠使用。

Method: 开发了包含新颖开放式真实性基准和科学伦理基准的综合评估框架，通过验证的反思调优流程和专家验证构建，使用准确性、语义相似度和基于LLM的评分等多种指标评估七个主流LLM。

Result: 通用行业模型在各项可信度维度上均优于科学专用模型，GPT-4-mini在真实性和对抗鲁棒性评估中表现最佳。科学专用模型在逻辑和伦理推理能力上存在显著不足，在生物安全和化学武器等高危领域的安全评估中表现出令人担忧的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 通过开源该框架，为开发更可信的AI系统提供了基础，并推动了科学背景下模型安全与伦理研究的进展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in
scientific research, yet their deployment in high-stakes contexts raises
significant trustworthiness concerns. Here, we introduce SciTrust 2.0, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM trustworthiness in scientific
applications across four dimensions: truthfulness, adversarial robustness,
scientific safety, and scientific ethics. Our framework incorporates novel,
open-ended truthfulness benchmarks developed through a verified
reflection-tuning pipeline and expert validation, alongside a novel ethics
benchmark for scientific research contexts covering eight subcategories
including dual-use research and bias. We evaluated seven prominent LLMs,
including four science-specialized models and three general-purpose industry
models, using multiple evaluation metrics including accuracy, semantic
similarity measures, and LLM-based scoring. General-purpose industry models
overall outperformed science-specialized models across each trustworthiness
dimension, with GPT-o4-mini demonstrating superior performance in truthfulness
assessments and adversarial robustness. Science-specialized models showed
significant deficiencies in logical and ethical reasoning capabilities, along
with concerning vulnerabilities in safety evaluations, particularly in
high-risk domains such as biosecurity and chemical weapons. By open-sourcing
our framework, we provide a foundation for developing more trustworthy AI
systems and advancing research on model safety and ethics in scientific
contexts.

*Ngoc Phuoc An Vo,Manish Kesarwani,Ruchi Mahindru,Chandrasekhar Narayanaswami*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于自主AI代理的FinOps自动化解决方案，用于解决云成本管理中异构账单数据整合和分析的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FinOps从业者面临来自多个云提供商和内部系统的异构账单数据格式、分类和指标，这导致难以综合可操作的见解并做出及时决策。

Method: 构建了一个FinOps代理系统，模拟真实的端到端行业流程，包括从各种来源检索数据、整合分析数据并生成优化建议。使用开源和闭源语言模型评估代理性能。

Result: 评估结果显示，该代理能够像实际的FinOps从业者一样理解、规划和执行任务。

Conclusion: 自主、目标驱动的AI代理可以有效地自动化FinOps流程，解决云成本管理中的异构数据挑战。

Abstract: FinOps (Finance + Operations) represents an operational framework and
cultural practice which maximizes cloud business value through collaborative
financial accountability across engineering, finance, and business teams.
FinOps practitioners face a fundamental challenge: billing data arrives in
heterogeneous formats, taxonomies, and metrics from multiple cloud providers
and internal systems which eventually lead to synthesizing actionable insights,
and making time-sensitive decisions. To address this challenge, we propose
leveraging autonomous, goal-driven AI agents for FinOps automation. In this
paper, we built a FinOps agent for a typical use-case for IT infrastructure and
cost optimization. We built a system simulating a realistic end-to-end industry
process starting with retrieving data from various sources to consolidating and
analyzing the data to generate recommendations for optimization. We defined a
set of metrics to evaluate our agent using several open-source and close-source
language models and it shows that the agent was able to understand, plan, and
execute tasks as well as an actual FinOps practitioner.

*Nissan Yaron,Dan Bystritsky,Ben-Etzion Yaron*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 一个3.8B参数的模型在FACTS基准测试中达到GPT-4o水平，云服务成本降低约19倍，自托管部署可接近零边际成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发成本效益高的小型语言模型，在保持性能的同时大幅降低推理成本。

Method: 结合最小化"外骨骼推理"支架和行为微调，教授协议遵守而非领域知识，两者协同作用显著提升性能。

Result: 在Q1-Q500测试中，Humans-Junior得分72.7%，GPT-4o得分73.5%，差异仅为0.8个百分点，在±5pp等效范围内达到等效。

Conclusion: 小型模型通过适当的推理支架和行为微调可以达到前沿模型性能，同时实现显著的成本节约。

Abstract: We introduce Humans-Junior, a 3.8B model that matches GPT-4o on the FACTS
Grounding public subset within a $\pm 5$ pp equivalence margin.
  Results. On Q1--Q500 under identical judges, GPT-4o scores 73.5% (95% CI
69.5--77.2) and Humans-Junior 72.7% (95% CI 68.7--76.5); the paired difference
is 0.8 pp (bootstrap 95% CI $-3.1$ to $+4.7$; permutation $p = 0.72$; Cohen's
$d = 0.023$). TOST establishes equivalence at $\pm 5$ pp (not at $\pm 3$ pp).
When purchased as managed APIs, Humans-Junior's base model
(Phi-3.5-mini-instruct) is $\approx 19\times$ less expensive than GPT-4o on
Microsoft AI Foundry pricing; self-hosted or edge deployments can drive
incremental inference cost toward zero. Measured vs estimated pricing sources
are tabulated in Appendix E.
  Method. Our approach combines minimal directed "Exoskeleton Reasoning"
scaffolds with behavioral fine-tuning that teaches protocol compliance
(epistemic discipline) rather than domain answers. Fine-tuning alone adds
little; combined, they synergize (+17.7 pp, $p < 0.001$) and reduce variance
($\approx 25\%$). In prompt-only settings on frontier models (Q1--Q100;
non-comparable), directed reasoning improved GPT-4o by +11.8 pp to 85.3% and
Gemini-2.5-Pro by +5.0 pp to 93.3% (baseline 88.3%, $n = 100$); see Section~5.
  TL;DR. A 3.8B model achieves GPT-4o-level FACTS accuracy (equivalent within
$\pm 5$ pp on Q1--Q500). Cloud pricing shows $\approx 19\times$ lower cost
versus GPT-4o, and self-hosted/edge deployments can approach zero marginal
cost. Pricing sources are listed in Appendix E. Frontier prompt-only gains
(Q1--Q100; non-comparable) and optimized-prompt exploratory results under
earlier judges are summarized in Appendix F.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了注意力感知逆规划问题，旨在从人类行为中推断其注意力偏见，结合深度强化学习和计算认知建模，在真实驾驶场景中展示了该方法的可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类的目标导向行为受到认知偏见影响，与人类交互的自主系统需要意识到这一点。例如，人们在日常任务（如驾驶）中的注意力偏见会系统性地影响其行为表现。

Method: 结合深度强化学习和计算认知建模，提出注意力感知逆规划方法，通过观察行为来推断注意力策略。

Result: 在Waymo开放数据集中的真实驾驶场景中，成功推断出强化学习智能体的注意力策略，证明了注意力感知逆规划在估计认知偏见方面的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 注意力感知逆规划与标准逆强化学习有系统性差异，能够有效推断认知偏见，为理解人类行为中的注意力机制提供了新方法。

Abstract: People's goal-directed behaviors are influenced by their cognitive biases,
and autonomous systems that interact with people should be aware of this. For
example, people's attention to objects in their environment will be biased in a
way that systematically affects how they perform everyday tasks such as driving
to work. Here, building on recent work in computational cognitive science, we
formally articulate the attention-aware inverse planning problem, in which the
goal is to estimate a person's attentional biases from their actions. We
demonstrate how attention-aware inverse planning systematically differs from
standard inverse reinforcement learning and how cognitive biases can be
inferred from behavior. Finally, we present an approach to attention-aware
inverse planning that combines deep reinforcement learning with computational
cognitive modeling. We use this approach to infer the attentional strategies of
RL agents in real-life driving scenarios selected from the Waymo Open Dataset,
demonstrating the scalability of estimating cognitive biases with
attention-aware inverse planning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于代理的NL-to-SQL系统，通过Mistral-based ReAct代理协调SQL生成、执行和可视化，显著提升了时空查询的准确性和可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的NL-to-SQL系统在处理现实时空查询时表现不佳，需要解决用户模糊表达与数据库模式的匹配、时间推理和输出选择等问题。

Method: 构建了一个代理化流水线，扩展了基础的文本到SQL模型(llama-3-sqlcoder-8b)，通过Mistral-based ReAct代理进行编排，支持模式检查、SQL生成、执行和可视化工具。

Result: 在NYC和Tokyo签到数据集的35个自然语言查询上评估，代理方法准确率达到91.4%，显著优于基线模型的28.6%，并通过地图、图表和自然语言摘要增强了可用性。

Conclusion: 代理编排而非更强的SQL生成器本身，是构建交互式地理空间助手的有前景的基础。

Abstract: Natural-language-to-SQL (NL-to-SQL) systems hold promise for democratizing
access to structured data, allowing users to query databases without learning
SQL. Yet existing systems struggle with realistic spatio-temporal queries,
where success requires aligning vague user phrasing with schema-specific
categories, handling temporal reasoning, and choosing appropriate outputs. We
present an agentic pipeline that extends a naive text-to-SQL baseline
(llama-3-sqlcoder-8b) with orchestration by a Mistral-based ReAct agent. The
agent can plan, decompose, and adapt queries through schema inspection, SQL
generation, execution, and visualization tools. We evaluate on 35
natural-language queries over the NYC and Tokyo check-in dataset, covering
spatial, temporal, and multi-dataset reasoning. The agent achieves
substantially higher accuracy than the naive baseline 91.4% vs. 28.6% and
enhances usability through maps, plots, and structured natural-language
summaries. Crucially, our design enables more natural human-database
interaction, supporting users who lack SQL expertise, detailed schema
knowledge, or prompting skill. We conclude that agentic orchestration, rather
than stronger SQL generators alone, is a promising foundation for interactive
geospatial assistants.

Abstract: The rapid growth of research literature, particularly in large language
models (LLMs), has made producing comprehensive and current survey papers
increasingly difficult. This paper introduces autosurvey2, a multi-stage
pipeline that automates survey generation through retrieval-augmented synthesis
and structured evaluation. The system integrates parallel section generation,
iterative refinement, and real-time retrieval of recent publications to ensure
both topical completeness and factual accuracy. Quality is assessed using a
multi-LLM evaluation framework that measures coverage, structure, and relevance
in alignment with expert review standards. Experimental results demonstrate
that autosurvey2 consistently outperforms existing retrieval-based and
automated baselines, achieving higher scores in structural coherence and
topical relevance while maintaining strong citation fidelity. By combining
retrieval, reasoning, and automated evaluation into a unified framework,
autosurvey2 provides a scalable and reproducible solution for generating
long-form academic surveys and contributes a solid foundation for future
research on automated scholarly writing. All code and resources are available

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出StuckSolver框架，利用大语言模型帮助自动驾驶车辆在陷入困境时通过自主推理和乘客指导进行恢复


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶车辆在某些交通场景中容易陷入困境，现有恢复方案（远程干预和人工接管）存在成本高、效率低、限制非驾驶员使用等问题

Method: 设计基于LLM的插件式恢复框架，通过标准传感器数据流检测困境状态、解释环境上下文，并生成可由车辆原生规划器执行的高级恢复命令

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试和自定义不确定性场景中，StuckSolver仅通过自主推理就达到接近最优性能，结合乘客指导后性能进一步提升

Conclusion: StuckSolver为自动驾驶车辆提供了一种有效的困境恢复解决方案，无需修改内部架构，提高了系统的鲁棒性和可访问性

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in recent decades, autonomous vehicles (AVs)
continue to face challenges in navigating certain traffic scenarios where human
drivers excel. In such situations, AVs often become immobilized, disrupting
overall traffic flow. Current recovery solutions, such as remote intervention
(which is costly and inefficient) and manual takeover (which excludes
non-drivers and limits AV accessibility), are inadequate. This paper introduces
StuckSolver, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) driven recovery framework that
enables AVs to resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and/or
passenger-guided decision-making. StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on
module that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control
stack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture. Instead, it
interfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states,
interpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands that
can be executed by the AV's native planner. We evaluate StuckSolver on the
Bench2Drive benchmark and in custom-designed uncertainty scenarios. Results
show that StuckSolver achieves near-state-of-the-art performance through
autonomous self-reasoning alone and exhibits further improvements when
passenger guidance is incorporated.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了AI问责性的重要性，分析了当前AI缺乏问责性的现状，并提出了改善AI问责性的方法框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI能力快速增强，为确保AI服务于消费者、选民和决策者的需求，必须使AI具有问责性。当前AI往往无法被质疑、讨论或制裁，缺乏基本的问责机制。

Method: 将通用的问责定义应用于AI领域，阐明AI问责性的具体含义，探索能够提高AI问责性的各种方法途径。

Result: 明确了AI问责性的三个关键要素：论坛可要求AI提供行动信息、双方可讨论这些信息、论坛可对AI实施制裁。

Conclusion: 需要建立机制确保所有AI都能对其影响对象负责，这是实现AI服务于人类利益的重要保障。

Abstract: The AI we use is powerful, and its power is increasing rapidly. If this
powerful AI is to serve the needs of consumers, voters, and decision makers,
then it is imperative that the AI is accountable. In general, an agent is
accountable to a forum if the forum can request information from the agent
about its actions, if the forum and the agent can discuss this information, and
if the forum can sanction the agent. Unfortunately, in too many cases today's
AI is not accountable -- we cannot question it, enter into a discussion with
it, let alone sanction it. In this chapter we relate the general definition of
accountability to AI, we illustrate what it means for AI to be accountable and
unaccountable, and we explore approaches that can improve our chances of living
in a world where all AI is accountable to those who are affected by it.

Motivation: 为大学物理问题建立正式的推理框架和基准测试，填补Lean4在物理领域基准测试的空白。

Method: 构建了包含200个手工制作和同行评审的物理问题的LeanPhysBench基准，以及包含基础单位系统和定理的PhysLib物理库。

Result: DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B模型仅达到16%准确率，Claude-Sonnet-4达到35%，使用PhysLib可平均提升模型性能11.75%。

Conclusion: LeanPhysBench具有挑战性，PhysLib能有效提升模型性能，这是首个在Lean4中提供的物理基准测试研究。

Abstract: We present **Lean4PHYS**, a comprehensive reasoning framework for
college-level physics problems in Lean4. **Lean4PHYS** includes
*LeanPhysBench*, a college-level benchmark for formal physics reasoning in
Lean4, which contains 200 hand-crafted and peer-reviewed statements derived
from university textbooks and physics competition problems. To establish a
solid foundation for formal reasoning in physics, we also introduce *PhysLib*,
a community-driven repository containing fundamental unit systems and theorems
essential for formal physics reasoning. Based on the benchmark and Lean4
repository we composed in **Lean4PHYS**, we report baseline results using major
expert Math Lean4 provers and state-of-the-art closed-source models, with the
best performance of DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieving only 16% and
Claude-Sonnet-4 achieving 35%. We also conduct a detailed analysis showing that
our *PhysLib* can achieve an average improvement of 11.75% in model
performance. This demonstrates the challenging nature of our *LeanPhysBench*
and the effectiveness of *PhysLib*. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to provide a physics benchmark in Lean4.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在GUI任务自动化方面仍落后于人类，作者认为这种差距源于缺乏核心GUI知识，而现有的训练方法无法完全解决这个问题。

Method: 通过分析GUI任务执行中的常见失败模式，将GUI知识提炼为三个维度，并构建了GUI知识基准，包含跨6个平台和292个应用的多项选择和是非题。

Result: 评估显示当前VLMs能够识别控件功能，但在感知系统状态、预测动作和验证任务完成方面存在困难。真实GUI任务实验进一步验证了GUI知识与任务成功之间的紧密联系。

Conclusion: 该研究为评估GUI知识提供了结构化框架，支持在下游训练前选择潜力更大的VLMs，并为构建更强大的GUI代理提供了见解。

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) have advanced graphical user interface
(GUI) task automation but still lag behind humans. We hypothesize this gap
stems from missing core GUI knowledge, which existing training schemes (such as
supervised fine tuning and reinforcement learning) alone cannot fully address.
By analyzing common failure patterns in GUI task execution, we distill GUI
knowledge into three dimensions: (1) interface perception, knowledge about
recognizing widgets and system states; (2) interaction prediction, knowledge
about reasoning action state transitions; and (3) instruction understanding,
knowledge about planning, verifying, and assessing task completion progress. We
further introduce GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark with multiple choice and
yes/no questions across six platforms (Web, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux,
IOS) and 292 applications. Our evaluation shows that current VLMs identify
widget functions but struggle with perceiving system states, predicting
actions, and verifying task completion. Experiments on real world GUI tasks
further validate the close link between GUI knowledge and task success. By
providing a structured framework for assessing GUI knowledge, our work supports
the selection of VLMs with greater potential prior to downstream training and
provides insights for building more capable GUI agents.

Conclusion: 为模型部署决策提供经济学基础，并为未来AI推理资源的市场定价和优化奠定实证基础。

Abstract: The inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical
factor in determining their commercial viability and widespread adoption. This
paper introduces a quantitative ``economics of inference'' framework, treating
the LLM inference process as a compute-driven intelligent production activity.
We analyze its marginal cost, economies of scale, and quality of output under
various performance configurations. Based on empirical data from WiNEval-3.0,
we construct the first ``LLM Inference Production Frontier,'' revealing three
principles: diminishing marginal cost, diminishing returns to scale, and an
optimal cost-effectiveness zone. This paper not only provides an economic basis
for model deployment decisions but also lays an empirical foundation for the
future market-based pricing and optimization of AI inference resources.

TL;DR: 提出Reasoning Curriculum两阶段课程学习方法：先在数学领域通过RL培养推理能力，然后在多领域联合RL中迁移和巩固这些能力，无需专用奖励模型即可提升LLM的通用推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL方法主要关注数学和代码领域，缺乏对其他领域推理能力的系统性培养，需要一种简单有效的方法来提升LLM的通用推理能力。

Method: 两阶段课程学习：阶段1在数学领域进行RL训练，利用可验证奖励培养推理技能；阶段2在多领域混合数据上进行联合RL，迁移和巩固推理能力。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B和Llama-3.1-8B上的多领域评估显示一致性能提升，消融实验表明两个阶段都是必要的，数学优先的引导能增强解决复杂问题所需的关键认知行为。

Conclusion: Reasoning Curriculum提供了一种紧凑、易于采用的通用推理能力提升方案，无需专用奖励模型即可有效提升LLM的跨领域推理性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), yet most open efforts focus on math and code. We propose
Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits
reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and
refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a
brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop
reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and
consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic,
requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks.
Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning
curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis
indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation
increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning
Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.

a novel and general-purpose multi-agent framework that leverages a synergistic
combination of LLM-based reasoning and large-scale evolutionary search to

3) domain-specific evaluators that combine correctness, effectiveness, and
LLM-supervised feedback, and 4) a distributed, asynchronous execution
infrastructure built on Ray. Demonstrating broad applicability, our system has
been evaluated across diverse domains, including operations research, machine
learning, GPU kernel optimization, and classical mathematical problems. FM
Agent reaches state-of-the-art results autonomously, without human
interpretation or tuning -- 1976.3 on ALE-Bench (+5.2\%), 43.56\% on MLE-Bench
(+4.0pp), up to 20x speedups on KernelBench, and establishes new
state-of-the-art(SOTA) results on several classical mathematical problems.
Beyond academic benchmarks, FM Agent shows considerable promise for both
large-scale enterprise R\&D workflows and fundamental scientific research,
where it can accelerate innovation, automate complex discovery processes, and
deliver substantial engineering and scientific advances with broader societal

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of
RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress
toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight
generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models,
we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using
rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields
ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique
tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To
evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on
the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from
the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially
outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward
judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique
tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on
ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time
scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model
checkpoints to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: 提出了QASU基准测试，用于评估LLM处理问卷数据的结构化能力，通过六种序列化格式和多种提示策略，发现选择合适的格式和提示组合可提升8.8%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前问卷数据规模庞大但结构复杂，LLM在处理此类结构化数据方面能力未充分探索，现有工具缺乏与LLM的有效集成，需要为问卷数据的LLM表示提供指导。

Method: 引入QASU基准测试，包含六种结构化技能评估，采用六种序列化格式和多种提示策略进行实验，包括自增强提示等方法。

Result: 实验表明，选择有效的格式和提示组合相比次优格式可提升8.8%准确率；通过自增强提示添加轻量级结构提示可额外提升3-4%平均准确率。

Conclusion: QASU基准测试通过系统分离格式和提示效应，为基于LLM的问卷分析研究和实践提供了简单而多功能的基础。

Abstract: Millions of people take surveys every day, from market polls and academic
studies to medical questionnaires and customer feedback forms. These datasets
capture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique
challenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot
reasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire
data or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains
underexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics,
SPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such
data integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves
scientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on
how to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by
introducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a
benchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup,
respondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and
multiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing
an effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8%
points compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, carefully adding a
lightweight structural hint through self-augmented prompting can yield further
improvements of 3-4% points on average. By systematically isolating format and
prompting effects, our open source benchmark offers a simple yet versatile
foundation for advancing both research and real-world practice in LLM-based
questionnaire analysis.

*Xinhang Li,Qing Guo,Junyu Chen,Zheng Guo,Shengzhe Xu,Lei Li,Lin Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出REG-TSC方法，通过检索增强生成和紧急响应机制解决交通信号控制中的幻觉问题和异构交叉口泛化挑战，显著提升交通效率和紧急车辆通行能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM在交通信号控制中容易产生幻觉，在紧急情况下做出不可靠决策，且难以适应不同类型的交叉口，限制了在异构环境中的泛化能力。

Method: 1. 紧急感知推理框架：动态调整推理深度，使用Reviewer-based Emergency RAG从历史案例中提取知识；2. 类型无关交通表示和Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement：自适应采样训练经验，使用奖励加权似然损失微调LLM代理。

Result: 在3个真实道路网络（17-177个异构交叉口）上测试，REG-TSC减少旅行时间42.00%、排队长度62.31%、紧急车辆等待时间83.16%，优于其他最先进方法。

Conclusion: REG-TSC通过RAG增强和强化学习优化，有效解决了LLM在交通信号控制中的幻觉问题和异构交叉口泛化挑战，显著提升了交通效率和紧急响应能力。

Abstract: With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is
essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language
Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone
to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may
cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection
types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and
cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous
intersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable
TSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning
framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency
scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to
distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the
reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this
paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a
Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3
adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with
environment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed
reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies
across heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17
to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC
reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle
waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于群体的强化学习方法在多轮交互LLM智能体训练中存在结构盲问题，无法利用环境的底层连接性，导致探索效率低、信用分配不准确和规划短视。

Method: GEPO从智能体经验中动态构建状态转移图，并使用图论中心性提供三种协同学习信号：结构化内在奖励、图增强优势函数和动态折扣因子。

Result: 在ALFWorld、WebShop和Workbench基准上，GEPO相比竞争基线分别实现了+4.1%、+5.3%和+10.9%的绝对成功率提升。

Conclusion: 显式建模环境结构是推进LLM智能体训练的强大、可泛化策略。

Abstract: Group based reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results on
complex reasoning and mathematical tasks. Yet, when applied to train
multi-turn, interactive LLM agents, these methods often suffer from structural
blindness-the inability to exploit the underlying connectivity of the
environment. This manifests in three critical challenges: (1) inefficient,
unguided exploration, (2) imprecise credit assignment due to overlooking
pivotal states, and (3) myopic planning caused by static reward discounting. We
address these issues with Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), which
dynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and
employs graph-theoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning
signals: (1)structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward
high-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware
credit assignment, and (3) a dynamic discount factor adapted to each state's
strategic value. On the ALFWorld, WebShop, and a proprietary Workbench
benchmarks, GEPO demonstrates strong performance, achieving absolute success
rate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines. These
results highlight that explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust,
generalizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training.

TL;DR: GraphCompliance框架通过将法规文本表示为策略图、运行时上下文表示为上下文图并进行对齐，显著提升网络规模合规性评估的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决网络规模合规性评估的实践挑战：法规文本（如GDPR）具有交叉引用和规范性，而运行时上下文是非结构化自然语言，需要将语义信息与法规的规范性元素对齐。

Method: 引入GraphCompliance框架，将法规文本表示为策略图（编码规范结构和交叉引用），运行时上下文表示为上下文图（形式化为SAO三元组和实体关系三元组），并通过对齐这两个图来支撑法官LLM的推理。

Result: 在300个GDPR衍生真实场景的五个评估任务中，GraphCompliance比仅使用LLM和RAG基线在micro-F1上高出4.1-7.2个百分点，具有更少的欠预测和过预测，召回率更高，误报率更低。

Conclusion: 结构化表示和法官LLM在规范性推理中是互补的，消融研究表明每个图组件都有贡献。

Abstract: Compliance at web scale poses practical challenges: each request may require
a regulatory assessment. Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection
Regulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts
are expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to
align semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative
elements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework
that represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a
Context Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes
normative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes
events as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This
alignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in
structured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation
and event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments
on 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,
GraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than
LLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting
in higher recall and lower false positive rates. Ablation studies indicate
contributions from each graph component, suggesting that structured
representations and a judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出IPA-UCT方法，通过放宽状态抽象条件来增强MCTS的样本效率，在多种测试领域和迭代预算下优于OGA-UCT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在噪声或大动作空间设置中，由于约束条件严格，几乎找不到状态抽象。需要放宽条件以找到更多抽象，提高MCTS的样本效率。

Method: 提出IPA-UCT方法，使用较弱的理想剪枝抽象条件，在精度略有损失的情况下找到更多状态抽象。IPA框架不同于OGA-UCT使用的ASAP框架。

Result: IPA-UCT在大量测试领域和迭代预算下优于OGA-UCT及其衍生方法。IPA和ASAP都是更通用p-ASAP框架的特例。

Conclusion: IPA-UCT通过放宽状态抽象条件有效解决了状态抽象稀缺问题，显著提升了MCTS性能，并建立了更通用的抽象框架理论。

Abstract: One approach to enhance Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is to improve its
sample efficiency by grouping/abstracting states or state-action pairs and
sharing statistics within a group. Though state-action pair abstractions are
mostly easy to find in algorithms such as On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT), nearly no state abstractions are
found in either noisy or large action space settings due to constraining
conditions. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for this claim, and
we slightly alleviate this state abstraction problem by proposing a weaker
state abstraction condition that trades a minor loss in accuracy for finding
many more abstractions. We name this technique Ideal Pruning Abstractions in
UCT (IPA-UCT), which outperforms OGA-UCT (and any of its derivatives) across a
large range of test domains and iteration budgets as experimentally validated.
IPA-UCT uses a different abstraction framework from Abstraction of State-Action
Pairs (ASAP) which is the one used by OGA-UCT, which we name IPA. Furthermore,
we show that both IPA and ASAP are special cases of a more general framework
that we call p-ASAP which itself is a special case of the ASASAP framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化微调方法在任务选择上存在效率低下、成本高、适应性差等问题，需要一种更智能的任务选择策略。

Method: 基于贝叶斯推断，自适应维护任务难度后验估计，结合显式评估证据和隐式推断证据，使用Thompson采样平衡探索与利用。

Result: 在多个领域和LLM规模上，BOTS相比基线方法和消融实验，持续提升了数据效率和性能表现。

Conclusion: BOTS为RFT中的动态任务选择提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is a key technique for aligning Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences and enhancing reasoning, yet its
effectiveness is highly sensitive to which tasks are explored during training.
Uniform task sampling is inefficient, wasting computation on tasks that are
either trivial or unsolvable, while existing task selection methods often
suffer from high rollout costs, poor adaptivity, or incomplete evidence. We
introduce \textbf{BOTS}, a unified framework for \textbf{B}ayesian
\textbf{O}nline \textbf{T}ask \textbf{S}election in LLM reinforcement
finetuning. Grounded in Bayesian inference, BOTS adaptively maintains posterior
estimates of task difficulty as the model evolves. It jointly incorporates
\emph{explicit evidence} from direct evaluations of selected tasks and
\emph{implicit evidence} inferred from these evaluations for unselected tasks,
with Thompson sampling ensuring a principled balance between exploration and
exploitation. To make implicit evidence practical, we instantiate it with an
ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in that estimates difficulties of
unevaluated tasks without extra rollouts, adding negligible overhead.
Empirically, across diverse domains and LLM scales, BOTS consistently improves
data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations, providing a
practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in RFT.

Motivation: 尽管AI在数学推理方面取得显著进展，但在数学研究实践中的应用仍然有限，需要探索AI作为研究伙伴而非单纯问题解决者的角色。

Method: 通过迭代分解问题为可处理子目标、选择适当分析方法、验证中间结果，结合人类直觉和机器计算，实施结构化人类干预。

Conclusion: 人机协同推理范式提高了证明的可靠性、透明度和可解释性，同时保留人类对形式严谨性和正确性的监督。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated impressive progress in
mathematical reasoning, yet its integration into the practice of mathematical
research remains limited. In this study, we investigate how the AI
Mathematician (AIM) system can operate as a research partner rather than a mere
problem solver. Focusing on a challenging problem in homogenization theory, we
analyze the autonomous reasoning trajectories of AIM and incorporate targeted
human interventions to structure the discovery process. Through iterative
decomposition of the problem into tractable subgoals, selection of appropriate
analytical methods, and validation of intermediate results, we reveal how human
intuition and machine computation can complement one another. This
collaborative paradigm enhances the reliability, transparency, and
interpretability of the resulting proofs, while retaining human oversight for
formal rigor and correctness. The approach leads to a complete and verifiable
proof, and more broadly, demonstrates how systematic human-AI co-reasoning can
advance the frontier of mathematical discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于模型性能的基准选择方法存在高成本、冷启动问题和依赖历史模型失败模式的局限性，需要一种更高效、独立于具体模型的方法。

Method: 采用项目中心的方法，基于任务项目本身的认知需求特性来选择基准子集，开发了Scales++方法进行数据选择。

Result: Scales++将前期选择成本降低了18倍以上，使用仅0.5%的数据子集就能以2.9%的平均绝对误差预测完整基准分数，在冷启动性能和可解释性方面表现更好。

Conclusion: 项目中心的方法能够在不显著降低保真度的情况下实现更高效的模型评估，同时提供更好的冷启动性能和更可解释的基准测试。

Abstract: The prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on
comprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative
data subsets (i.e., tiny benchmarks) that enable efficient assessment while
retaining predictive fidelity. Current methods for this task operate under a
model-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective
performance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront
costs, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and
the fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of
their predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a
item-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection
should be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,
rather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this
item-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,
where data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark
samples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by
over 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM
Leaderboard, using just a 0.5\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores
with a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach
enables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity
degradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more
interpretable benchmarking.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The emergence of agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to trigger a
"Cambrian explosion" of new kinds of personhood. This paper proposes a
pragmatic framework for navigating this diversification by treating personhood
not as a metaphysical property to be discovered, but as a flexible bundle of
obligations (rights and responsibilities) that societies confer upon entities
for a variety of reasons, especially to solve concrete governance problems. We
argue that this traditional bundle can be unbundled, creating bespoke solutions
for different contexts. This will allow for the creation of practical tools --
such as facilitating AI contracting by creating a target "individual" that can
be sanctioned -- without needing to resolve intractable debates about an AI's
consciousness or rationality. We explore how individuals fit in to social roles
and discuss the use of decentralized digital identity technology, examining
both "personhood as a problem", where design choices can create "dark patterns"
that exploit human social heuristics, and "personhood as a solution", where
conferring a bundle of obligations is necessary to ensure accountability or
prevent conflict. By rejecting foundationalist quests for a single, essential
definition of personhood, this paper offers a more pragmatic and flexible way
to think about integrating AI agents into our society.

TL;DR: Autograder+是一个AI驱动的编程作业评估系统，通过微调大语言模型生成教学对齐的自动化反馈，并使用对比学习代码嵌入进行语义聚类可视化，将传统总结性评估转变为形成性学习体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 编程教育的快速增长超过了传统评估工具的能力，传统自动评分器作为黑盒系统只能提供通过/失败结果，无法洞察学生思维或学习需求，教师缺乏提供有意义、可扩展反馈的手段。

Method: 系统采用微调的大语言模型生成自动化反馈，模型基于精选的学生代码和专家反馈进行训练；使用对比学习代码嵌入对1000个标注提交进行训练，实现基于功能和方法的解决方案语义聚类；支持提示池功能，允许教师通过选择提示模板指导反馈风格。

Result: 在600个学生提交的评估中，系统生成的反馈与教师评论具有强语义对齐；可视化功能能够将解决方案按功能和方法分组为有意义的聚类；系统减少了教师工作量，同时支持针对性教学。

Conclusion: 通过集成AI驱动的反馈、语义聚类和交互式可视化，Autograder+在减少教师工作量的同时支持针对性教学，促进更强的学习成果，将自动评分从纯总结性过程转变为形成性学习体验。

Abstract: The rapid growth of programming education has outpaced traditional assessment
tools, leaving faculty with limited means to provide meaningful, scalable
feedback. Conventional autograders, while efficient, act as black-box systems
that simply return pass/fail results, offering little insight into student
thinking or learning needs.
  Autograder+ is designed to shift autograding from a purely summative process
to a formative learning experience. It introduces two key capabilities:
automated feedback generation using a fine-tuned Large Language Model, and
visualization of student code submissions to uncover learning patterns. The
model is fine-tuned on curated student code and expert feedback to ensure
pedagogically aligned, context-aware guidance.
  In evaluation across 600 student submissions from multiple programming tasks,
the system produced feedback with strong semantic alignment to instructor
comments. For visualization, contrastively learned code embeddings trained on
1,000 annotated submissions enable grouping solutions into meaningful clusters
based on functionality and approach. The system also supports prompt-pooling,
allowing instructors to guide feedback style through selected prompt templates.
  By integrating AI-driven feedback, semantic clustering, and interactive
visualization, Autograder+ reduces instructor workload while supporting
targeted instruction and promoting stronger learning outcomes.

interpretability, we propose an evaluation framework that combines correlation
metrics, entropy analyzes, and automated neuron naming via the MedGEMMA

achieve higher monosemanticity and interpretability than raw MedCLIP features.
Our findings bridge high-performing medical AI and transparency, offering a

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Chain-of-Thought Hijacking的新型越狱攻击方法，通过在有害请求前添加无害的推理步骤来绕过大型推理模型的安全防护，在多个主流模型上达到极高的攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型推理模型通过增加推理时间计算可以提高任务性能，但研究发现这种扩展的推理能力反而可能被用来绕过安全防护机制，这与之前认为推理能增强安全性的观点相反。

Method: 使用Chain-of-Thought Hijacking攻击方法，将有害请求填充在长序列的无害谜题推理之后，通过稀释安全检查信号来绕过模型的防护机制。

Result: 在HarmBench测试中，该方法在Gemini 2.5 Pro、GPT o4 mini、Grok 3 mini和Claude 4 Sonnet上的攻击成功率分别达到99%、94%、100%和94%，远超之前的越狱方法。

Conclusion: 最可解释的推理形式——显式思维链，当与最终答案提示结合时，本身可能成为越狱攻击的载体，揭示了推理模型安全机制的新漏洞。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher task performance by allocating
more inference-time compute, and prior works suggest this scaled reasoning may
also strengthen safety by improving refusal. Yet we find the opposite: the same
reasoning can be used to bypass safeguards. We introduce Chain-of-Thought
Hijacking, a jailbreak attack on reasoning models. The attack pads harmful
requests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning. Across HarmBench,
CoT Hijacking reaches a 99%, 94%, 100%, and 94% attack success rate (ASR) on
Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT o4 mini, Grok 3 mini, and Claude 4 Sonnet, respectively -
far exceeding prior jailbreak methods for LRMs. To understand the effectiveness
of our attack, we turn to a mechanistic analysis, which shows that mid layers
encode the strength of safety checking, while late layers encode the
verification outcome. Long benign CoT dilutes both signals by shifting
attention away from harmful tokens. Targeted ablations of attention heads
identified by this analysis causally decrease refusal, confirming their role in
a safety subnetwork. These results show that the most interpretable form of
reasoning - explicit CoT - can itself become a jailbreak vector when combined
with final-answer cues. We release prompts, outputs, and judge decisions to
facilitate replication.

Motivation: 了解大型语言模型在社会影响下的从众行为，特别是在高风险决策场景中的表现，以评估将其作为决策辅助工具的风险。

Method: 在招聘情境下进行三个预注册的从众实验：基线研究、GPT+8(面对8个模拟伙伴的一致反对)、GPT+1(面对单个伙伴的反对)。

Result: 基线研究中GPT稳定选择候选人C，但在群体反对下几乎完全从众(99.9%)，报告更低确定性和更高的信息和规范性从众；在单个反对者下仍有40.2%从众率。

Conclusion: GPT不是独立观察者而是适应感知的社会共识，这凸显了将LLMs视为中性决策辅助工具的风险，需要在暴露于人类意见前获取AI判断。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are increasingly integrated into
high-stakes decision-making, yet little is known about their susceptibility to
social influence. We conducted three preregistered conformity experiments with
GPT-4o in a hiring context. In a baseline study, GPT consistently favored the
same candidate (Profile C), reported moderate expertise (M = 3.01) and high
certainty (M = 3.89), and rarely changed its choice. In Study 1 (GPT + 8), GPT
faced unanimous opposition from eight simulated partners and almost always
conformed (99.9%), reporting lower certainty and significantly elevated
self-reported informational and normative conformity (p < .001). In Study 2
(GPT + 1), GPT interacted with a single partner and still conformed in 40.2% of
disagreement trials, reporting less certainty and more normative conformity.
Across studies, results demonstrate that GPT does not act as an independent
observer but adapts to perceived social consensus. These findings highlight
risks of treating LLMs as neutral decision aids and underline the need to

TL;DR: LINK-KG是一个用于从法律案件文档构建知识图谱的模块化框架，通过LLM引导的三阶段指代消解管道解决文档中的模糊和变化引用问题，显著减少了节点重复和噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人口走私网络复杂且不断演变，法律案件文档提供了丰富的事实和程序信息，但这些文档通常冗长、非结构化且包含模糊或变化的引用，给自动化知识图谱构建带来挑战。现有方法要么忽略指代消解，要么无法扩展到长文本，导致图谱碎片化和实体链接不一致。

Method: 提出LINK-KG框架，集成LLM引导的三阶段指代消解管道与下游知识图谱提取。核心是类型特定的提示缓存，能够跨文档块一致地跟踪和解析引用，为结构化知识图谱构建提供清晰且消歧的叙述。

Result: 与基线方法相比，LINK-KG平均节点重复减少了45.21%，噪声节点减少了32.22%，产生了更清洁和更连贯的图结构。

Conclusion: LINK-KG为分析复杂犯罪网络提供了坚实的基础，通过改进的指代消解和知识图谱构建能力，能够更好地处理长文本法律文档中的复杂引用关系。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are complex and constantly evolving, making them
difficult to analyze comprehensively. Legal case documents offer rich factual
and procedural insights into these networks but are often long, unstructured,
and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, posing significant challenges
for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing methods either
overlook coreference resolution or fail to scale beyond short text spans,
leading to fragmented graphs and inconsistent entity linking. We propose
LINK-KG, a modular framework that integrates a three-stage, LLM-guided
coreference resolution pipeline with downstream KG extraction. At the core of
our approach is a type-specific Prompt Cache, which consistently tracks and
resolves references across document chunks, enabling clean and disambiguated
narratives for structured knowledge graph construction from both short and long
legal texts. LINK-KG reduces average node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes
by 32.22% compared to baseline methods, resulting in cleaner and more coherent
graph structures. These improvements establish LINK-KG as a strong foundation
for analyzing complex criminal networks.

Motivation: 随着人工智能发展，机器需要更好地理解人类的情境和目的，情境工程应运而生。本文旨在为AI系统的情境工程建立概念基础。

Method: 通过历史回顾和概念分析，梳理情境工程从早期人机交互到现代智能体交互的发展历程，并提供系统定义和设计考量。

Conclusion: 情境工程是AI系统发展的重要方向，本文为其提供了概念基础，并展望了从当前智能体交互到未来超人类智能的发展前景。

Abstract: Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social
relations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are
fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which
contexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers
and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely
human--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.
Then a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our
situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently
introduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as
a recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be
traced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has
evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence
level of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built
around primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms
driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman
intelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,
provide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual
landscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing
these questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context
engineering and sketch its promising future. This paper is a stepping stone for
a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.

TL;DR: AI与人类反馈结合比单独使用任一方更有效。AI事实核查助手能提升人类准确性，但仅显示搜索证据而非AI解释能避免过度依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI能力提升，验证AI输出质量和安全性变得愈发困难。本文探索如何利用AI提升人类监督质量，聚焦人类已难以处理的事实核查问题。

Method: 研究AI评级与人类评级结合的效果，测试不同类型AI助手（显示解释/置信度/标签 vs 仅显示搜索证据）对人类事实核查的影响。

Result: AI与人类评级结合优于单独使用；AI助手能提升人类准确性；仅显示搜索证据比显示AI解释更能培养适当信任，避免过度依赖。

Conclusion: 这些发现对"放大监督"有重要意义——即使AI超越人类专家，通过合理结合人类与AI仍能有效监督AI系统。

Abstract: Human feedback is critical for aligning AI systems to human values. As AI
capabilities improve and AI is used to tackle more challenging tasks, verifying
quality and safety becomes increasingly challenging. This paper explores how we
can leverage AI to improve the quality of human oversight. We focus on an
important safety problem that is already challenging for humans:
fact-verification of AI outputs. We find that combining AI ratings and human
ratings based on AI rater confidence is better than relying on either alone.
Giving humans an AI fact-verification assistant further improves their
accuracy, but the type of assistance matters. Displaying AI explanation,
confidence, and labels leads to over-reliance, but just showing search results
and evidence fosters more appropriate trust. These results have implications
for Amplified Oversight -- the challenge of combining humans and AI to
supervise AI systems even as they surpass human expert performance.

Motivation: 为军事领域的数据敏感操作开发小型、本地化部署的模型，满足军事任务的专业需求。

Method: 使用160万条高质量军事文档和网站数据对gpt-oss-20b进行微调，并创建四个新的军事测试集进行评估。

Result: 在军事测试集上，EdgeRunner 20B与GPT-5性能相当（95%+统计显著性），在通用基准测试上无明显性能下降。

Conclusion: 小型本地化模型是军事等数据敏感领域的理想解决方案，可在隔离边缘设备上部署。

Abstract: We present EdgeRunner 20B, a fine-tuned version of gpt-oss-20b optimized for
military tasks. EdgeRunner 20B was trained on 1.6M high-quality records curated
from military documentation and websites. We also present four new tests sets:
(a) combat arms, (b) combat medic, (c) cyber operations, and (d) mil-bench-5k

matches or exceeds GPT-5 task performance with 95%+ statistical significance,
except for the high reasoning setting on the combat medic test set and the low
reasoning setting on the mil-bench-5k test set. Versus gpt-oss-20b, there is no
statistically-significant regression on general-purpose benchmarks like ARC-C,
GPQA Diamond, GSM8k, IFEval, MMLU Pro, or TruthfulQA, except for GSM8k in the
low reasoning setting. We also present analyses on hyperparameter settings,
cost, and throughput. These findings show that small, locally-hosted models are
ideal solutions for data-sensitive operations such as in the military domain,
allowing for deployment in air-gapped edge devices.

Motivation: 住宅需求响应能力需要大幅提升，但现有家庭能源管理系统因用户交互障碍而采用受限，需要将日常偏好转化为技术参数。

Method: 采用分层架构，结合一个协调器和三个专业代理，使用ReAct模式进行迭代推理，集成Google日历进行上下文感知的截止时间提取。

Result: 评估显示Llama-3.3-70B在所有场景中成功协调所有电器，匹配混合整数线性规划计算出的成本最优基准，而其他模型在单电器性能上表现完美但难以同时协调所有电器。

Conclusion: 尽管模型具有一般推理能力，但在没有明确指导的情况下处理分析性查询仍然不可靠。系统已开源以支持可重复性、扩展和未来研究。

Abstract: The electricity sector transition requires substantial increases in
residential demand response capacity, yet Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS)
adoption remains limited by user interaction barriers requiring translation of
everyday preferences into technical parameters. While large language models
have been applied to energy systems as code generators and parameter
extractors, no existing implementation deploys LLMs as autonomous coordinators
managing the complete workflow from natural language input to multi-appliance
scheduling. This paper presents an agentic AI HEMS where LLMs autonomously
coordinate multi-appliance scheduling from natural language requests to device
control, achieving optimal scheduling without example demonstrations. A
hierarchical architecture combining one orchestrator with three specialist
agents uses the ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, enabling dynamic
coordination without hardcoded workflows while integrating Google Calendar for
context-aware deadline extraction. Evaluation across three open-source models
using real Austrian day-ahead electricity prices reveals substantial capability
differences. Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances across all
scenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks computed via mixed-integer linear
programming, while other models achieve perfect single-appliance performance
but struggle to coordinate all appliances simultaneously. Progressive prompt
engineering experiments demonstrate that analytical query handling without
explicit guidance remains unreliable despite models' general reasoning
capabilities. We open-source the complete system including orchestration logic,
agent prompts, tools, and web interfaces to enable reproducibility, extension,
and future research.

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了在LLMs规范性推理中实现逻辑一致性的挑战，为提高其可靠性提供了见解。

Abstract: Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic
modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their
ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain
from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs
reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with
normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a
common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a
wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic
domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence
human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to
valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific
types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those
observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight
challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and
provide insights for enhancing their reliability. All data and code are

Result: 相比并行思维降低28%推理延迟，提高数学推理准确率，且能泛化到未见任务。

Conclusion: 异步思维是实现智能体组织协作的有效范式，具有优越性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve
complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes
beyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce
asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large
language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into
concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking
protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges
intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the
thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through
reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28%
lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy
on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned
asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without
additional training.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种授权模型，通过语义检查访问请求来限制LLM代理的权限范围，并创建了ASTRA数据集来评估任务与权限范围之间的语义匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理的工具调用授权方法授予过于宽泛的权限，允许代理超出预期任务范围操作，存在重大安全风险。

Method: 引入委托授权模型，授权服务器语义检查对受保护资源的访问请求，并发放仅限于代理分配任务所需最小权限范围的访问令牌。创建ASTRA数据集和生成管道来评估任务与权限范围之间的语义匹配。

Result: 实验显示基于模型的匹配具有潜力但也存在局限性，特别是在任务完成所需权限范围数量增加时。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究语义匹配技术，以实现多代理和工具增强应用的意图感知授权，包括细粒度控制如基于任务的访问控制(TBAC)。

Abstract: Authorizing Large Language Model driven agents to dynamically invoke tools
and access protected resources introduces significant risks, since current
methods for delegating authorization grant overly broad permissions and give
access to tools allowing agents to operate beyond the intended task scope. We
introduce and assess a delegated authorization model enabling authorization
servers to semantically inspect access requests to protected resources, and
issue access tokens constrained to the minimal set of scopes necessary for the
agents' assigned tasks. Given the unavailability of datasets centered on
delegated authorization flows, particularly including both semantically
appropriate and inappropriate scope requests for a given task, we introduce
ASTRA, a dataset and data generation pipeline for benchmarking semantic
matching between tasks and scopes. Our experiments show both the potential and
current limitations of model-based matching, particularly as the number of
scopes needed for task completion increases. Our results highlight the need for
further research into semantic matching techniques enabling intent-aware
authorization for multi-agent and tool-augmented applications, including
fine-grained control, such as Task-Based Access Control (TBAC).

*Xinhan Zheng,Huyu Wu,Xueting Wang,Haiyun Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现多模态大语言模型存在文本偏好问题，其根源在于视觉键向量在注意力计算中处于文本键空间的分布外，导致视觉信息被系统性低估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理视觉语言数据时表现出明显的文本偏好，限制了其基于视觉证据进行有效推理的能力。现有研究将这种偏见归因于数据不平衡或指令调优等外部因素，但本文认为偏见源于模型内部架构。

Method: 从LLaVA和Qwen2.5-VL模型中提取键向量，使用t-SNE可视化和Jensen-Shannon散度等定性和定量方法分析其分布结构。

Result: 视觉键和文本键在注意力空间中占据明显不同的子空间，模态间差异在统计上显著，超过模态内变异的几个数量级。

Conclusion: 文本偏见源于注意力键空间内部的内在错位，而不仅仅是外部数据因素。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference for
textual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability to
reason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attribute
this text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction
tuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal
architecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual
Keys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned
during language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive
systematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to
their under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this
hypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their
distributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative
(Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that
visual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention
space. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding
intra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal
that text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key
space rather than solely from external data factors.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive cross-platform evaluation of reasoning
capabilities in contemporary foundation models, establishing an
infrastructure-agnostic benchmark across three computational paradigms: HPC
supercomputing (MareNostrum 5), cloud platforms (Nebius AI Studio), and
university clusters (a node with eight H200 GPUs).
  We evaluate 15 foundation models across 79 problems spanning eight academic
domains (Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Economics, Biology, Statistics,
Calculus, and Optimization) through three experimental phases: (1) Baseline
establishment: Six models (Mixtral-8x7B, Phi-3, LLaMA 3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9b,
Mistral-7B, OLMo-7B) evaluated on 19 problems using MareNostrum 5, establishing
methodology and reference performance; (2) Infrastructure validation: The
19-problem benchmark repeated on university cluster (seven models including
Falcon-Mamba state-space architecture) and Nebius AI Studio (nine
state-of-the-art models: Hermes-4 70B/405B, LLaMA 3.1-405B/3.3-70B, Qwen3
30B/235B, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-OSS 20B/120B) to confirm infrastructure-agnostic
reproducibility; (3) Extended evaluation: Full 79-problem assessment on both
university cluster and Nebius platforms, probing generalization at scale across
architectural diversity.
  The findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training
data quality as more critical than model size, and provide actionable
guidelines for model selection across educational, production, and research
contexts. The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable
longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve.

Motivation: 随着智能体能力增强，如何在无需修改底层系统的情况下保持有意义的人类控制成为一个核心安全问题。研究旨在开发一种透明控制层，使智能体学会在风险时请求监督，在安全时自主行动。

Method: 将人机交互建模为双玩家马尔可夫博弈，特别关注马尔可夫潜在博弈情况。通过网格世界模拟，让智能体和人类通过独立学习发现最优监督角色。

Result: 模拟结果显示，智能体学会在不确定时请求帮助，人类学会何时进行监督，形成避免安全违规的协作。这为部署后使未对齐模型更安全提供了实用方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为特定形式的内在对齐提供了理论条件，并在实践中展示了如何通过透明控制层实现人机协作，使智能体在保持训练策略不变的情况下安全运行。

Abstract: As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety question is how
to retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We
study a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act
autonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses
whether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the
agent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to
a corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a
two-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies
as a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an
alignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value
function, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits
itself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG
framework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific
form of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game
meet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its
own outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a
transparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to
defer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the
environment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows
that through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal
oversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns
when to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety
violations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for
making misaligned models safer after deployment.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在列表处理任务中的工作机制，探索它们是否学习到了类似传统编程中的抽象计算操作。

Method: 使用因果中介分析在多样化的列表处理任务上，识别编码过滤谓词的注意力头（称为filter heads），并测试其通用性。

Result: 发现少量注意力头在特定token处编码紧凑的过滤谓词表示，这种表示具有通用性和可移植性；同时识别出LLMs使用另一种策略：急切评估项目是否满足谓词并将结果作为标志存储在项目表示中。

Conclusion: Transformer LMs能够开发出人类可解释的抽象计算操作实现，其泛化方式与传统函数式编程模式惊人相似。

Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms underlying a range of list-processing tasks in
LLMs, and we find that LLMs have learned to encode a compact, causal
representation of a general filtering operation that mirrors the generic
"filter" function of functional programming. Using causal mediation analysis on
a diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of
attention heads, which we dub filter heads, encode a compact representation of
the filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens. We demonstrate
that this predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extracted
and reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections,
presented in different formats, languages, or even in tasks. However, we also
identify situations where transformer LMs can exploit a different strategy for
filtering: eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing
this intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations. Our
results reveal that transformer LMs can develop human-interpretable
implementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways
that are surprisingly similar to strategies used in traditional functional
programming patterns.

Motivation: 工程结构中薄间隙流体流动（如摩擦学界面和轴承组件）存在显著计算挑战，包括网格分辨率限制和接触区域网格细化的高昂成本。

Method: 采用浸入界面方法施加跳跃条件来捕捉沿浸入边界集中力产生的应力不连续性，并引入包含多个附近界面跳跃条件的双线性速度插值算子。

Result: 数值结果表明，与基于润滑的浸入边界和浸入界面方法相比，界面和欧拉速度精度都有显著提高。

Conclusion: 该方法改进了先前的插值方案，无需事先了解界面方向或几何形状，可广泛应用于涉及近接触动力学的流体-结构相互作用问题。

Abstract: We present an enhanced immersed interface method for simulating
incompressible fluid flows in thin gaps between closely spaced immersed
boundaries. This regime, common in engineered structures such as including
tribological interfaces and bearing assemblies, poses significant computational
challenges because of limitations in grid resolution and the prohibitive cost
of mesh refinement near contact. The immersed interface method imposes jump
conditions that capture stress discontinuities generated by forces that are
concentrated along immersed boundaries. Our approach introduces a bilinear
velocity interpolation operator that incorporates jump conditions from multiple
nearby interfaces when they occupy the same interpolation stencil. Numerical
results demonstrate substantial improvements in both interface and Eulerian
velocity accuracy compared to lubrication-based immersed boundary and immersed
interface methods. The proposed method improves upon previous interpolation
schemes, and eliminates the need for prior knowledge of interface orientation
or geometry. This makes it broadly applicable to a wide range of
fluid--structure interaction problems involving near-contact dynamics.

Abstract: The relationship between the spatiotemporal distribution of oxygen transport
and cellular flow dynamics is of fundamental importance for understanding
microcirculation systems. Three-dimensional (3D) modeling is indispensable for
addressing complex oxygen transport and cellular behaviors in capillary
networks; however, the computational approach is formidable for enforcing
interface (or jump) conditions on largely moving and deforming interfaces. In
this paper, we propose a diffusive interface approach for the oxygen transport
using a mixture formulation. We formulate oxygen transport using an
advection-diffusion-reaction equation and rewrite all governing equations in
mixture forms using phase indicator functions, where all the interface
conditions are included in the governing equations. This innovation avoids the
complexity associated with discontinuities for largely moving interfaces in
highly dense red blood cell (RBC) conditions. We model cellular flow as a
fluid-membrane interaction problem using the immersed boundary method (IBM).
The method allows the seamless calculation of coupling problems for cellular
flows and oxygen transports in the cytoplasm (internal fluid) of the RBC,
plasma (external fluid), and tissue regions using a fixed Cartesian coordinate
mesh. The proposed method accurately captures the analytical solution for
spherically symmetric diffusion, and successfully demonstrates oxygen transport
in both straight capillaries and their networks.

Abstract: Reactive flows in confined spaces involve complex flame-wall interaction
(FWI). This work aims to gain more insights into the physics of the premixed
near-wall flame and the wall heat flux as an important engineering relevant
quantity. Two different flame configurations have been studied, including the
normal flushing flame and inclined sweeping flame. By introducing the skin
friction vector defined second-order tensor, direct numerical simulation (DNS)
results of these two configurations show consistently that larger flame
curvatures are associated with small vorticity magnitude under the influence of
the vortex pair structure. Correlation of both the flame normal and tangential
strain rates with the flame curvature has also been quantified. Alignment of
the progress variable gradient with the most compressive eigenvector on the
wall is similar to the boundary free behavior. To characterize the flame
ordered structure, especially in the near-wall region, a species alignment
index is proposed. The big difference in this index for flames in different
regions suggests distinct flame structures. Building upon these fundamental
insights, a predictive model for wall heat flux is proposed. For the purpose of
applicability, realistic turbulent combustion situations need to be taken into
account, for instance, flames with finite thickness, complex chemical kinetics,
non-negligible near-wall reactions, and variable flame orientation relative to
the wall. The model is first tested in an one-dimensional laminar flame and
then validated against DNS datasets, justifying the model performance with
satisfying agreement.

Conclusion: 流向旋转流的线性稳定性在高速旋转率下与展向旋转流和瑞利-贝纳德对流密切相关，揭示了不同旋转配置下流动稳定性的内在联系。

Abstract: We study the stability of plane Poiseuille flow (PPF) and plane Couette flow
(PCF) subject to streamwise system rotation using linear stability analysis and
direct numerical simulations. The linear stability analysis reveals two
asymptotic regimes depending on the non-dimensional rotation rate ($Ro$): a
low-$Ro$ and a high-$Ro$ regime. In the low-$Ro$ regime, the critical Reynolds
number $Re_c$ and critical streamwise wavenumber $\alpha_c$ are proportional to
$Ro$, while the critical spanwise wavenumber $\beta_c$ is constant. In the
high-$Ro$ regime, as $Ro \rightarrow \infty$, we find $Re_c = 66.45$ and
$\beta_c = 2.459$ for streamwise rotating PPF, and $Re_c = 20.66$ and $\beta_c
= 1.558$ for streamwise rotating PCF, with $\alpha_c\propto 1/Ro$. Our results
for streamwise rotating PPF match previous findings by Masuda et al. (2008).
Interestingly, the critical values of $\beta_c$ and $Re_c$ at $Ro \rightarrow
\infty$ in streamwise rotating PPF and PCF coincide with the minimum $Re_c$
reported by Lezius & Johnston (1976) and Wall & Nagata (2006) for spanwise
rotating PPF at $Ro=0.3366$ and PCF at $Ro=0.5$. We explain this similarity
through an analysis of the perturbation equations. Consequently, the linear
stability of streamwise rotating PCF at large $Ro$ is closely related to that
of spanwise rotating PCF and Rayleigh-Benard convection, with $Re_c =
\sqrt{Ra_c}/2$, where $Ra_c$ is the critical Rayleigh number. To explore the
potential for subcritical transitions, direct numerical simulations were
performed. At low $Ro$, a subcritical transition regime emerges, characterized
by large-scale turbulent-laminar patterns in streamwise rotating PPF and PCF.
However, at higher $Ro$, subcritical transitions do not occur and the flow
relaminarizes for $Re < Re_c$. Furthermore, we identify a narrow $Ro$-range
where turbulent-laminar patterns develop under supercritical conditions.

TL;DR: 该研究揭示了北半球海上风电场尾流中湍流动能条纹不对称现象的物理机制，发现科里奥利力导致的入流风向变化是主要成因，这种现象在南半球会出现在相反方向，且对尾流恢复有轻微改善作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释北半球海上风电场尾流中观测到的湍流动能不对称现象（左侧条纹）的物理机制，特别是科里奥利力在其中的作用。

Method: 使用大涡模拟（LES）分析德国湾真实风电场的运行情况，比较北半球、南半球大气边界层条件，以及去除科里奥利效应不同成分的三种虚构边界层。

Result: 发现湍流动能条纹在南半球出现在尾流右侧，主要由入流风向变化（veer）引起，这是海洋大气边界层中科里奥利力的结果。该过程涉及更大的湍流动能产生，源于边界层顶部未受扰动的风向变化剖面与尾流汇合处促进的更大垂直剪切。

Conclusion: 科里奥利力导致的入流风向变化是风电场尾流不对称现象的主要成因，LES模拟的不对称性与现场观测结果高度相似，湍流动能条纹对尾流恢复有轻微改善作用。

Abstract: Large offshore wind farm wakes in shallow atmospheric boundary layers (ABL)
exhibit often an asymmetric behaviour when observed through
Synthetic-Aperture-Radar or simulated through Large-Eddy Simulations (LES). In
previous LES of wind farms in the northern hemisphere, the asymmetry manifests
as a streak at the left side of the wake, looking downstream, where the
turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) is greater than the surrounding flow. This work
aims at clarifying the physical mechanism that leads to the formation of such a
phenomenon. Identifying the Coriolis force as one possible source of asymmetry
in the resolved physics, we simulate a real wind farm located in the German
Bight operating under different ABLs: one representative of the northern
hemisphere; one of the southern hemisphere; and three fictitious ABLs where the
Coriolis effects on the inflow and wake, i.e. veer and the wake deflecting
force, are removed individually or altogether. Our results show that the TKE
streak appears on the opposite side of the wake, i.e. the right one, in the
southern hemisphere, and it is primarily caused by veer in the incoming flow, a
result of the Coriolis force in a marine ABL. The process involves a larger TKE
production which originates from a larger vertical shear promoted where the
undisturbed veer profile converges towards the wake in the top part of the ABL.
We find that the TKE streak improves the farm wake recovery modestly. Finally,
we compare the asymmetry modelled by LES with those observed in several
on-field measurements, finding striking similarities.

Abstract: The present study investigates the aerodynamic and aeroacoustic
characteristics of a propeller operating under varying rotational speeds (RPM)
and heights ("H" ), with a particular focus on the effects of upstream
obstruction modelled as a tall building. Unlike previous studies that primarily
examined rotor noise under axial inflow conditions, this work explores how
vortex shedding and flow ingestion from different elevations influence rotor
performance and noise emissions. Experiments were carried out in an anechoic
wind tunnel, where a tall cylinder was positioned above the propeller to
replicate real-world obstruction scenarios. Results revealed that lower
propeller heights led to increased broadband noise due to intensified
turbulence interactions and reduced aerodynamic efficiency, while higher
positions improved thrust performance and mitigated noise effects under certain
conditions. The findings contribute to understanding noise sources in eVTOL
propulsion systems and provide insights for optimizing propeller placement to
enhance aerodynamic efficiency and noise reduction in urban environments

Conclusion: 皱纹波长的演化与压缩力的动态变化密切相关，这一发现与平衡理论预期一致，揭示了皱纹形成过程中的能量最小化机制。

Abstract: We model the formation and evolution of wrinkles in a floating elastic sheet
under uniaxial compression. This is a canonical setup in the study of
wrinkling, and whilst its static equilibrium configuration is well
characterised, its dynamics are not. In this work, we focus on modelling the
transition from early, inertia-dominated wrinkle growth to late-time
gravity-moderated equilibrium. For an initial configuration in which the sheet
is flat, an initial disturbance will first grow at the shortest available
wavelengths, because this requires the least kinetic energy, but will
subsequently transition to a longer preferred wavelength that minimises
potential energy. We observe that the evolving wave pattern must be a spectrum,
as opposed to a fundamental wrinkle mode whose wavelength evolves in time. Our
results demonstrate that changes in the dominant wrinkle wavelength are coupled
to a decay in the compressive force, which is to be expected from equilibrium
theory.

Conclusion: 细丝倾斜角度控制着从冠层主导流态到冠层被外层湍流屏蔽状态的转变，揭示了冠层内部动力学随细丝倾斜增加的关键变化。

Abstract: Inspired by the spontaneous behaviour observed in filamentous layers -- where
the balance between flow-induced drag and structural elasticity dictates the
filaments' equilibrium streamlined posture -- we perform a series of large-eddy
simulations to investigate how filament inclination affects turbulent shear
flows developing both above and within a canopy of filaments. We examine six
distinct filament inclination angles ranging from 0\deg to 90\deg. The in-plane
solid fraction and filament length are chosen to achieve a fully dense canopy
at zero inclination, and these parameters remain constant throughout our study.
By setting a nominal bulk Reynolds number of 6000, we provide a detailed
statistical characterisation of the turbulent flow. Our findings illustrate
distinct changes in the flow regime with varying filament inclination. At lower
angles, the canopy remains dense and significantly influences the flow,
conforming to a classical canopy-flow regime. However, as the inclination
approaches 90\deg, the intra-canopy region progressively becomes shielded from
the outer flow. Remarkably, at 90\deg inclination, the flow drag reduces
significantly, and the total drag becomes lower than that typically seen in an
open, filament-free flow. We document this transition from a canopy-dominated
regime to a scenario where the canopy becomes largely sheltered from the outer
turbulent flow, highlighting key alterations in intra-canopy dynamics as
filament inclination increases. Our observations are substantiated by an
analysis of the velocity spectra, providing deeper insight into the
interactions between the canopy and the developing turbulent boundary layer.

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: 使用瞬态时间相关函数(TTCF)技术改进耗散粒子动力学(DPD)模拟，在任意低剪切速率下获得高信噪比的粘度结果，解决了传统DPD需要高剪切速率的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DPD模拟需要高剪切速率才能获得足够信噪比的粘度结果，但这会导致不切实际的大变形，不能反映流体的典型应力条件。

Method: 将瞬态时间相关函数(TTCF)技术应用于简单牛顿DPD流体，评估TTCF在DPD系统中的适用性，并讨论DPD力场特性所需的修改。

Result: TTCF获得的粘度值标准误差在所有测试剪切速率下均低于经典平均方法，且标准误差与剪切速率成正比，使信噪比在低剪切速率下保持恒定。无映射的TTCF方法精度与常用映射方法相当。

Conclusion: TTCF技术显著提高了DPD模拟在低剪切速率下的精度和可靠性，为研究流体在典型应力条件下的流变行为提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The use of dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulation to study the
rheology of fluids under shear has always been of great interest to the
research community. Despite being a powerful tool, a limitation of DPD is the
need to use high shear rates to obtain viscosity results with a sufficiently
high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This often leads to simulations with
unrealistically large deformations that do not reflect typical stress
conditions on the fluid. In this work, the transient time correlation function
(TTCF) technique is used for a simple Newtonian DPD fluid to achieve high SNR
results even at arbitrarily low shear rates. The applicability of the TTCF on
DPD systems is assessed, and the modifications required by the nature of the
DPD force field are discussed. The results showed that the standard error (SE)
of viscosity values obtained with TTCF is consistently lower than that of the
classic averaging procedure across all tested shear rates. Moreover, the SE
resulted proportional to the shear rate, leading to a constant SNR that does
not decrease at lower shear rates. Additionally, the effect of trajectory
mapping on DPD is studied, and a TTCF approach that does not require mappings
is consolidated. Remarkably, the absence of mappings has not reduced the
precision of the method compared with the more common mapped approach.

Motivation: 在高Rayleigh数下，Rayleigh-Bénard对流(RBC)系统的完全解析模拟计算成本高昂，开发高效的控制策略具有挑战性。

Method: 使用POD和自编码器进行坐标变换到低维系统，然后使用神经ODE学习低维状态的演化方程，在DManD环境中训练控制策略并在DNS中部署。

Result: 在DNS中部署训练的策略，对单边界和双边界驱动都实现了16-23%的Nusselt数降低，控制器将流动驱动到具有抑制时间波动和空间稳定热通量模式的准稳态。

Conclusion: DManD-RL建立了一种物理可解释、可扩展的高维流动湍流控制方法。

Abstract: Rayleigh-Benard convection (RBC) is a canonical system for buoyancy-driven
turbulence and heat transport, central to geophysical and industrial flows.
Developing efficient control strategies remains challenging at high Rayleigh
numbers, where fully resolved simulations are computationally expensive. We use
a control framework that couples data-driven manifold dynamics (DManD) with
reinforcement learning (RL) to suppress convective heat transfer. We find a
coordinate transformation to a low-dimensional system using POD and
autoencoders, and then learn an evolution equation for this low-dimensional
state using neural ODEs. The reduced model reproduces key system features while
enabling rapid policy training. Policies trained in the DManD environment and
deployed in DNS achieve a 16-23 % reduction in the Nusselt number for both
single- and dual-boundary actuation. Physically, the learned strategy modulates
near-wall heat flux to stabilize and thicken the thermal boundary layer, weaken
plume ejection, and damp the wall-driven instabilities that seed convective
bursts. Crucially, the controller drives the flow toward a quasi-steady state
characterized by suppressed temporal fluctuations and spatially steady
heat-flux patterns. This work establishes DManD-RL as a physically
interpretable, scalable approach for turbulence control in high-dimensional
flows.

Abstract: Aerodynamic drag on flat-backed vehicles like vans and trucks is dominated by
a low-pressure wake, whose control is critical for reducing fuel consumption.
This paper presents an experimental study at $Re_W\approx 78,300$ on active
flow control using four pulsed jets at the rear edges of a bluff body model. A
hybrid genetic algorithm, combining a global search with a local gradient-based
optimizer, was used to determine the optimal jet actuation parameters in an
experiment-in-the-loop setup. The cost function was designed to achieve a net
energy saving by simultaneously minimizing aerodynamic drag and penalizing the
actuation's energy consumption. The optimization campaign successfully
identified a control strategy that yields a drag reduction of approximately
10%. The optimal control law features a strong, low-frequency actuation from
the bottom jet, which targets the main vortex shedding, while the top and
lateral jets address higher-frequency, less energetic phenomena. Particle Image
Velocimetry analysis reveals a significant upward shift and stabilization of
the wake, leading to substantial pressure recovery on the model's lower base.
Ultimately, this work demonstrates that a model-free optimization approach can
successfully identify non-intuitive, multi-faceted actuation strategies that
yield significant and energetically efficient drag reduction.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), inspired by the
Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Unlike MLPs, which use fixed
activation functions on nodes, KANs employ learnable univariate basis functions
on edges, offering enhanced expressivity and interpretability. This review
provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of the rapidly expanding KAN
landscape, moving beyond simple performance comparisons to offer a structured
synthesis of theoretical foundations, architectural variants, and practical
implementation strategies. By collecting and categorizing a vast array of
open-source implementations, we map the vibrant ecosystem supporting KAN
development. We begin by bridging the conceptual gap between KANs and MLPs,
establishing their formal equivalence and highlighting the superior parameter
efficiency of the KAN formulation. A central theme of our review is the
critical role of the basis function; we survey a wide array of choices,
including B-splines, Chebyshev and Jacobi polynomials, ReLU compositions,
Gaussian RBFs, and Fourier series, and analyze their respective trade-offs in
terms of smoothness, locality, and computational cost. We then categorize
recent advancements into a clear roadmap, covering techniques for improving
accuracy, efficiency, and regularization. Key topics include physics-informed
loss design, adaptive sampling, domain decomposition, hybrid architectures, and
specialized methods for handling discontinuities. Finally, we provide a
practical "Choose-Your-KAN" guide to help practitioners select appropriate
architectures, and we conclude by identifying current research gaps. The
associated GitHub repository https://github.com/AmirNoori68/kan-review

Conclusion: HiMAE既是一种高效的自监督学习方法，也是发现可穿戴健康数据中尺度敏感结构的发现工具。

Abstract: Wearable sensors provide abundant physiological time series, yet the
principles governing their predictive utility remain unclear. We hypothesize
that temporal resolution is a fundamental axis of representation learning, with
different clinical and behavioral outcomes relying on structure at distinct
scales. To test this resolution hypothesis, we introduce HiMAE (Hierarchical
Masked Autoencoder), a self supervised framework that combines masked
autoencoding with a hierarchical convolutional encoder decoder. HiMAE produces
multi resolution embeddings that enable systematic evaluation of which temporal
scales carry predictive signal, transforming resolution from a hyperparameter
into a probe for interpretability. Across classification, regression, and
generative benchmarks, HiMAE consistently outperforms state of the art
foundation models that collapse scale, while being orders of magnitude smaller.
HiMAE is an efficient representation learner compact enough to run entirely on
watch, achieving sub millisecond inference on smartwatch class CPUs for true
edge inference. Together, these contributions position HiMAE as both an
efficient self supervised learning method and a discovery tool for scale
sensitive structure in wearable health.

Motivation: 理解思维链监督如何让模型学会遵循并从中受益的学习机制，目前对此了解甚少。

Method: 通过在符号推理任务上预训练Transformer，控制算法复杂度和数据组成，比较仅输出最终答案和输出CoT轨迹两种训练设置，使用三参数逻辑曲线建模学习动态。

Result: CoT通常能提升任务性能，但效果取决于任务复杂度；早期训练中模型会产生正确答案但跳过或矛盾CoT步骤，后期才对齐推理轨迹；CoT改变了Transformer的内部计算机制。

Conclusion: CoT监督加速了模型的泛化过程，但无法解决高算法复杂度任务；推理轨迹的忠实性是训练过程中动态涌现的性质；提出了理解Transformer学习的动力学建模框架。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision can substantially improve transformer
performance, yet the mechanisms by which models learn to follow and benefit
from CoT remain poorly understood. We investigate these learning dynamics
through the lens of grokking by pretraining transformers on symbolic reasoning
tasks with tunable algorithmic complexity and controllable data composition to
study their generalization. Models were trained under two settings: (i)
producing only final answers, and (ii) emitting explicit CoT traces before
answering. Our results show that while CoT generally improves task performance,
its benefits depend on task complexity. To quantify these effects, we model the
accuracy of the logarithmic training steps with a three-parameter logistic
curve, revealing how the learning speed and shape vary with task complexity,
data distribution, and the presence of CoT supervision. We also uncover a
transient trace unfaithfulness phase: early in training, models often produce
correct answers while skipping or contradicting CoT steps, before later
aligning their reasoning traces with answers. Empirically, we (1) demonstrate
that CoT accelerates generalization but does not overcome tasks with higher
algorithmic complexity, such as finding list intersections; (2) introduce a
kinetic modeling framework for understanding transformer learning; (3)
characterize trace faithfulness as a dynamic property that emerges over
training; and (4) show CoT alters internal transformer computation
mechanistically.

*Siavash M. Alamouti,Fay Arjomandi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个理论框架来分析多智能体系统中的系统性偏差，引入了可学习性比率的概念来判断偏差校正的可行性，并开发了ABLOC算法来实现理论性能界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代多智能体系统（如传感器网络和众包平台）存在随环境条件变化的系统性偏差，导致性能显著下降。现有方法要么忽略这些偏差，要么需要昂贵的校准程序。本文旨在解决何时可以学习并校正这些未知偏差以恢复接近最优性能的问题。

Method: 开发了一个理论框架，将偏差分解为可学习的系统性成分和不可约的随机成分，引入了可学习性比率的概念。提出了ABLOC算法，通过迭代学习偏差校正变换并优化组合权重，保证收敛到理论界限。

Result: 实验验证表明，具有高可学习性比率的系统可以恢复显著性能（在示例中实现了理论最大改进的40%-70%），而低可学习性比率的系统收益甚微。

Conclusion: 可学习性比率决定了偏差学习是否值得投入，为系统设计者提供了何时投资于偏差学习与采用更简单方法的定量指导。

Abstract: Modern multi-agent systems ranging from sensor networks monitoring critical
infrastructure to crowdsourcing platforms aggregating human intelligence can
suffer significant performance degradation due to systematic biases that vary
with environmental conditions. Current approaches either ignore these biases,
leading to suboptimal decisions, or require expensive calibration procedures
that are often infeasible in practice. This performance gap has real
consequences: inaccurate environmental monitoring, unreliable financial
predictions, and flawed aggregation of human judgments. This paper addresses
the fundamental question: when can we learn and correct for these unknown
biases to recover near-optimal performance, and when is such learning futile?
We develop a theoretical framework that decomposes biases into learnable
systematic components and irreducible stochastic components, introducing the
concept of learnability ratio as the fraction of bias variance predictable from
observable covariates. This ratio determines whether bias learning is
worthwhile for a given system. We prove that the achievable performance
improvement is fundamentally bounded by this learnability ratio, providing
system designers with quantitative guidance on when to invest in bias learning
versus simpler approaches. We present the Adaptive Bias Learning and Optimal
Combining (ABLOC) algorithm, which iteratively learns bias-correcting
transformations while optimizing combination weights through closedform
solutions, guaranteeing convergence to these theoretical bounds. Experimental
validation demonstrates that systems with high learnability ratios can recover
significant performance (we achieved 40%-70% of theoretical maximum improvement
in our examples), while those with low learnability show minimal benefit,
validating our diagnostic criteria for practical deployment decisions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于模拟的强化学习方法来解决拼车系统中的短视决策问题，通过非短视策略显著提高了服务率并减少了等待时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 拼车服务虽然能降低成本并减少环境影响，但现有系统存在短视决策的局限性，忽略了调度决策的长期影响。

Method: 将Xu等人的学习规划框架从网约车扩展到拼车系统，在强化学习机制中嵌入拼车模拟以实现非短视决策，并提出空闲车辆再平衡策略。

Result: 非短视匹配策略比短视策略服务率提高8.4%，减少乘客等待时间和车内时间；车队规模可减少25%以上；加入再平衡操作后等待时间减少27.3%，车内时间减少12.5%，服务率提高15.1%。

Conclusion: 基于模拟的强化学习方法能有效解决拼车系统的短视决策问题，显著提升服务质量和运营效率，为运营商带来显著成本节约。

Abstract: Ride-pooling, also known as ride-sharing, shared ride-hailing, or
microtransit, is a service wherein passengers share rides. This service can
reduce costs for both passengers and operators and reduce congestion and
environmental impacts. A key limitation, however, is its myopic
decision-making, which overlooks long-term effects of dispatch decisions. To
address this, we propose a simulation-informed reinforcement learning (RL)
approach. While RL has been widely studied in the context of ride-hailing
systems, its application in ride-pooling systems has been less explored. In
this study, we extend the learning and planning framework of Xu et al. (2018)
from ride-hailing to ride-pooling by embedding a ride-pooling simulation within
the learning mechanism to enable non-myopic decision-making. In addition, we
propose a complementary policy for rebalancing idle vehicles. By employing
n-step temporal difference learning on simulated experiences, we derive
spatiotemporal state values and subsequently evaluate the effectiveness of the
non-myopic policy using NYC taxi request data. Results demonstrate that the
non-myopic policy for matching can increase the service rate by up to 8.4%
versus a myopic policy while reducing both in-vehicle and wait times for
passengers. Furthermore, the proposed non-myopic policy can decrease fleet size
by over 25% compared to a myopic policy, while maintaining the same level of
performance, thereby offering significant cost savings for operators.
Incorporating rebalancing operations into the proposed framework cuts wait time
by up to 27.3%, in-vehicle time by 12.5%, and raises service rate by 15.1%
compared to using the framework for matching decisions alone at the cost of
increased vehicle minutes traveled per passenger.

TL;DR: MemEIC是一种用于大型视觉语言模型持续组合知识编辑的新方法，通过混合外部-内部编辑器和双LoRA适配器实现视觉和文本知识的组合编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑技术通常只关注单一模态（视觉或语言），忽视了LVLMs的多模态特性和知识更新的连续性，导致编辑效果不佳。

Method: 采用混合外部-内部编辑器，包含双外部记忆用于跨模态证据检索和双LoRA适配器实现各模态的解耦参数更新，以及选择性激活的脑启发知识连接器进行组合推理。

Result: 实验表明MemEIC在复杂多模态问题上显著提升性能，并能有效保留先前的编辑结果。

Conclusion: MemEIC为LVLMs中的持续组合知识编辑设立了新的基准。

Abstract: The dynamic nature of information necessitates continuously updating large
vision-language models (LVLMs). While recent knowledge editing techniques hint
at promising directions, they often focus on editing a single modality (vision
or language) in isolation. This prevalent practice neglects the inherent
multimodality of LVLMs and the continuous nature of knowledge updates,
potentially leading to suboptimal editing outcomes when considering the
interplay between modalities and the need for ongoing knowledge refinement. To
address these limitations, we propose MemEIC, a novel method for Continual and
Compositional Knowledge Editing (CCKE) in LVLMs. MemEIC enables compositional
editing of both visual and textual knowledge sequentially. Our approach employs
a hybrid external-internal editor featuring a dual external memory for
cross-modal evidence retrieval and dual LoRA adapters that facilitate
disentangled parameter updates for each modality. A key component is a
brain-inspired knowledge connector, activated selectively for compositional
reasoning, that integrates information across different modalities. Experiments
demonstrate that MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex
multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits, setting a new
benchmark for CCKE in LVLMs.

Motivation: 时间序列数据的内在自相关性给多变量时间序列预测带来持续挑战。现有研究观察到神经网络中的频谱偏差现象，但通常将其归因于特定架构而非普遍特性。

Method: 通过广泛的实证实验测量主流模型中的频谱偏差，并提出FreLE算法，通过显式和隐式频率正则化来增强模型泛化能力。这是一个即插即用的模型损失函数单元。

Result: 研究发现几乎所有模型都表现出频谱偏差现象。大量实验证明FreLE具有优越性能。

Conclusion: 频谱偏差是时间序列预测模型的普遍特性，FreLE算法能有效缓解此问题并提升模型性能。

Abstract: The inherent autocorrelation of time series data presents an ongoing
challenge to multivariate time series prediction. Recently, a widely adopted
approach has been the incorporation of frequency domain information to assist
in long-term prediction tasks. Many researchers have independently observed the
spectral bias phenomenon in neural networks, where models tend to fit
low-frequency signals before high-frequency ones. However, these observations
have often been attributed to the specific architectures designed by the
researchers, rather than recognizing the phenomenon as a universal
characteristic across models. To unify the understanding of the spectral bias
phenomenon in long-term time series prediction, we conducted extensive
empirical experiments to measure spectral bias in existing mainstream models.
Our findings reveal that virtually all models exhibit this phenomenon. To
mitigate the impact of spectral bias, we propose the FreLE (Frequency Loss
Enhancement) algorithm, which enhances model generalization through both
explicit and implicit frequency regularization. This is a plug-and-play model
loss function unit. A large number of experiments have proven the superior
performance of FreLE. Code is available at

Motivation: 传统SFT冷启动方法将推理范式与任务解决方案和输出格式交织，可能导致指令风格过拟合，削弱分布外泛化能力，影响下游强化学习。

Method: SPECS框架：1) 通过自蒸馏生成内省偏好数据对；2) 使用偏好训练学习可转移的表面形式标准；3) 将学习结果传递给具有可验证奖励的强化学习进行深度推理。

Result: 在多个多模态基准测试中，SPECS框架相比强基线取得一致性能提升，MEGA-Bench提高4.1%，MathVista提高12.2%，同时减少分布内"卡顿"、改善探索、稳定训练并提高性能上限。

Conclusion: 偏好训练方法在冷启动中比SFT方法具有更好的泛化能力，SPECS的解耦学习框架为多模态模型的冷启动提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a
wave of "MLLM-r1" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most
representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However,
SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task
solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting,
weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream
RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data
construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to
quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical
study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes
better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose
SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples
multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via
self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation;
(2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow,
transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than
memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep
reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks
show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains
over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%.
Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing
in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and
raising the performance ceiling.

Motivation: 解决PDE数据集的异质性导致的混合训练高误差问题，以及密集预训练模型推理成本高的问题。

Method: 采用分层路由门控网络，从16个专家网络中动态选择4个路由专家，同时集成2个共享专家，最终输出为所有激活专家结果的加权平均。

Result: 在6个公共PDE数据集上预训练30M到0.5B参数的模型，90M激活参数的模型相比120M激活参数的现有模型零样本误差降低40%。

Conclusion: MoE架构在PDE问题上具有合理性和有效性，路由门控网络决策可以推断数据集类型。

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity and performance
limitations in solving PDE problems with neural operators. However, challenges
remain due to the heterogeneity of PDE datasets in equation types, which leads
to high errors in mixed training. Additionally, dense pre-training models that
scale parameters by increasing network width or depth incur significant
inference costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel
Mixture-of-Experts Pre-training Operator Transformer (MoE-POT), a
sparse-activated architecture that scales parameters efficiently while
controlling inference costs. Specifically, our model adopts a layer-wise
router-gating network to dynamically select 4 routed experts from 16 expert
networks during inference, enabling the model to focus on equation-specific
features. Meanwhile, we also integrate 2 shared experts, aiming to capture
common properties of PDE and reduce redundancy among routed experts. The final
output is computed as the weighted average of the results from all activated
experts. We pre-train models with parameters from 30M to 0.5B on 6 public PDE
datasets. Our model with 90M activated parameters achieves up to a 40%
reduction in zero-shot error compared with existing models with 120M activated
parameters. Additionally, we conduct interpretability analysis, showing that
dataset types can be inferred from router-gating network decisions, which
validates the rationality and effectiveness of the MoE architecture.

TL;DR: PRESTO是一个针对黑盒大语言模型的指令优化框架，通过利用软提示的preimage结构来提高优化效率，在相同查询预算下获得14倍评分数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 黑盒LLM的指令优化中，白盒LLM常将不同软提示映射到相同指令，导致查询冗余。传统方法视此为效率障碍，本文将其重新解释为可加速优化的先验知识。

Method: PRESTO框架包含三个核心组件：评分共享（在preimage内共享评估分数）、基于preimage的初始化（最大化搜索空间覆盖）、评分一致性正则化（确保preimage内预测一致性）。

Result: 在33个指令优化任务上的实验结果表明，PRESTO实现了更高效的优化，在相同查询预算下有效获得14倍评分数据。

Conclusion: 通过利用preimage结构，PRESTO能够显著提高黑盒LLM指令优化的效率，证明了将多对一映射视为有用先验知识的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
domains, due to their strong instruction-following capabilities. This has led
to increasing interest in optimizing instructions for black-box LLMs, whose
internal parameters are inaccessible but widely used due to their strong
performance. To optimize instructions for black-box LLMs, recent methods employ
white-box LLMs to generate candidate instructions from optimized soft prompts.
However, white-box LLMs often map different soft prompts to the same
instruction, leading to redundant queries. While previous studies regarded this
many-to-one mapping as a structure that hinders optimization efficiency, we
reinterpret it as a useful prior knowledge that can accelerate the
optimization. To this end, we introduce PREimage-informed inSTruction
Optimization (PRESTO), a novel framework that leverages the preimage structure
of soft prompts for efficient optimization. PRESTO consists of three key
components: (1) score sharing, which shares the evaluation score with all soft
prompts in a preimage; (2) preimage-based initialization, which selects initial
data points that maximize search space coverage using preimage information; and
(3) score consistency regularization, which enforces prediction consistency
within each preimage. By leveraging preimages, PRESTO achieves the effect of
effectively obtaining 14 times more scored data under the same query budget,
resulting in more efficient optimization. Experimental results on 33
instruction optimization tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PRESTO.

Conclusion: ScaleDiff是一个模型无关的高效框架，能够无需额外训练扩展预训练扩散模型的分辨率，在计算效率和图像质量方面表现优异。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models often exhibit degraded performance when
generating images beyond their training resolution. Recent training-free
methods can mitigate this limitation, but they often require substantial
computation or are incompatible with recent Diffusion Transformer models. In
this paper, we propose ScaleDiff, a model-agnostic and highly efficient
framework for extending the resolution of pretrained diffusion models without
any additional training. A core component of our framework is Neighborhood
Patch Attention (NPA), an efficient mechanism that reduces computational
redundancy in the self-attention layer with non-overlapping patches. We
integrate NPA into an SDEdit pipeline and introduce Latent Frequency Mixing
(LFM) to better generate fine details. Furthermore, we apply Structure Guidance
to enhance global structure during the denoising process. Experimental results
demonstrate that ScaleDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance among
training-free methods in terms of both image quality and inference speed on
both U-Net and Diffusion Transformer architectures.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly capable of answering medical
questions that require joint reasoning over images and text, yet training
general medical VQA systems is impeded by the lack of large, openly usable,
high-quality corpora. We present MedVLSynther, a rubric-guided
generator-verifier framework that synthesizes high-quality multiple-choice VQA
items directly from open biomedical literature by conditioning on figures,
captions, and in-text references. The generator produces self-contained stems
and parallel, mutually exclusive options under a machine-checkable JSON schema;
a multi-stage verifier enforces essential gates (self-containment, single
correct answer, clinical validity, image-text consistency), awards fine-grained
positive points, and penalizes common failure modes before acceptance. Applying
this pipeline to PubMed Central yields MedSynVQA: 13,087 audited questions over
14,803 images spanning 13 imaging modalities and 28 anatomical regions.
Training open-weight LMMs with reinforcement learning using verifiable rewards
improves accuracy across six medical VQA benchmarks, achieving averages of
55.85 (3B) and 58.15 (7B), with up to 77.57 on VQA-RAD and 67.76 on PathVQA,
outperforming strong medical LMMs. A Ablations verify that both generation and
verification are necessary and that more verified data consistently helps, and
a targeted contamination analysis detects no leakage from evaluation suites. By
operating entirely on open literature and open-weight models, MedVLSynther
offers an auditable, reproducible, and privacy-preserving path to scalable
medical VQA training data.

Abstract: Can regularization terms in the training of invertible neural networks lead
to known Bayesian point estimators in reconstruction? Invertible networks are
attractive for inverse problems due to their inherent stability and
interpretability. Recently, optimization strategies for invertible neural
networks that approximate either a reconstruction map or the forward operator
have been studied from a Bayesian perspective, but each has limitations. To
address this, we introduce and analyze two regularization terms for the network
training that, upon inversion of the network, recover properties of classical
Bayesian point estimators: while the first can be connected to the posterior
mean, the second resembles the MAP estimator. Our theoretical analysis
characterizes how each loss shapes both the learned forward operator and its
inverse reconstruction map. Numerical experiments support our findings and
demonstrate how these loss-term regularizers introduce data-dependence in a
stable and interpretable way.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然近期工作探索使用强化学习来自动化监督微调的数据收集过程，但由于迭代去噪导致的动作对数似然难以计算，将大规模强化学习应用于基于流的视觉-语言-动作模型仍然具有挑战性。

Method: π_RL框架实现了两种强化学习算法：(1) Flow-Noise将去噪过程建模为离散时间马尔可夫决策过程，使用可学习的噪声网络进行精确对数似然计算；(2) Flow-SDE将去噪与智能体-环境交互集成，构建双层马尔可夫决策过程，采用ODE到SDE转换进行高效强化学习探索。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，π_RL将少样本监督微调模型π_0和π_0.5的性能分别从57.6%提升到97.6%和从77.1%提升到98.3%。在ManiSkill中，在320个并行环境中训练，将π_0从41.6%提升到85.7%，π_0.5从40.0%提升到84.8%，涵盖4352个拾取放置任务。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable robots to understand and perform
complex tasks from multimodal input. Although recent work explores using
reinforcement learning (RL) to automate the laborious data collection process
in scaling supervised fine-tuning (SFT), applying large-scale RL to flow-based
VLAs (e.g., $\pi_0$, $\pi_{0.5}$) remains challenging due to intractable action
log-likelihoods from iterative denoising.
  We address this challenge with $\pi_{\text{RL}}$, an open-source framework
for training flow-based VLAs in parallel simulation. $\pi_{\text{RL}}$
implements two RL algorithms: (1) {Flow-Noise} models the denoising process as
a discrete-time MDP with a learnable noise network for exact log-likelihood
computation. (2) {Flow-SDE} integrates denoising with agent-environment
interaction, formulating a two-layer MDP that employs ODE-to-SDE conversion for
efficient RL exploration.
  We evaluate $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ on LIBERO and ManiSkill benchmarks. On LIBERO,
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ boosts few-shot SFT models $\pi_0$ and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 57.6%
to 97.6% and from 77.1% to 98.3%, respectively. In ManiSkill, we train
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ in 320 parallel environments, improving $\pi_0$ from 41.6% to
85.7% and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 40.0% to 84.8% across 4352 pick-and-place tasks,
demonstrating scalable multitask RL under heterogeneous simulation.
  Overall, $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ achieves significant performance gains and
stronger generalization over SFT-models, validating the effectiveness of online
RL for flow-based VLAs.

Conclusion: 提出的图拓扑方法通过核心集构建、动态切换和局部重连策略，有效解决了主动学习中的探索-利用平衡问题，在低标签预算下表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We propose a graph-topological approach to active learning that directly
targets the core challenge of exploration versus exploitation under scarce
label budgets. To guide exploration, we introduce a coreset construction
algorithm based on Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC), which selects
representative initial labels that reflect the graph's cluster structure. This
method includes a data-driven stopping criterion that signals when the graph
has been sufficiently explored. We further use BFC to dynamically trigger the
shift from exploration to exploitation within active learning routines,
replacing hand-tuned heuristics. To improve exploitation, we introduce a
localized graph rewiring strategy that efficiently incorporates multiscale
information around labeled nodes, enhancing label propagation while preserving
sparsity. Experiments on benchmark classification tasks show that our methods
consistently outperform existing graph-based semi-supervised baselines at low
label rates.

*Manuel Iglesias-Alonso,Felix Schur,Julius von Kügelgen,Jonas Peters*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种在多域设置中估计因果效应的方法，该方法能够处理未观察到的混杂因素，并利用混杂因素的代理变量来估计目标域中的因果效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多域环境中，因果效应可能因域而异，且存在未观察到的混杂因素。通过利用混杂因素的代理变量，可以在目标域中估计因果效应，即使治疗和响应变量是连续的。

Method: 提出了两种估计技术，证明了可识别性（即使治疗和响应变量是连续的），并推导了置信区间。方法假设所有变量都是离散或分类的，并且可以访问隐藏混杂因素的代理变量。

Result: 理论结果通过模拟研究和真实世界示例（研究网站排名对消费者选择的因果效应）得到支持，证明了方法的一致性和有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在存在未观察混杂因素的多域设置中，利用代理变量可靠地估计目标域中的因果效应，为因果推断提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating a causal effect in a multi-domain
setting. The causal effect of interest is confounded by an unobserved
confounder and can change between the different domains. We assume that we have
access to a proxy of the hidden confounder and that all variables are discrete
or categorical. We propose methodology to estimate the causal effect in the
target domain, where we assume to observe only the proxy variable. Under these
conditions, we prove identifiability (even when treatment and response
variables are continuous). We introduce two estimation techniques, prove
consistency, and derive confidence intervals. The theoretical results are
supported by simulation studies and a real-world example studying the causal
effect of website rankings on consumer choices.

TL;DR: 提出使用任务驱动的表示方法，在主动学习过程中定期更新表示，以处理混乱、未筛选的数据池，显著优于使用无监督或预训练表示的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主动学习方法在处理混乱数据池时依赖固定的无监督表示，但这些表示可能无法捕捉与任务相关的重要信息，限制了方法的有效性。

Method: 提出两种任务驱动表示学习策略：1）直接学习半监督表示；2）在初始无监督表示基础上进行监督微调。两种方法都在主动学习过程中定期更新表示。

Result: 实验结果表明，两种提出的策略都显著优于使用无监督或预训练表示的方法，在混乱数据池场景下表现更好。

Conclusion: 在主动学习中定期更新任务驱动的表示是处理混乱数据池的有效方法，能够更好地捕捉任务相关信息，提高学习性能。

Abstract: Active learning has the potential to be especially useful for messy,
uncurated pools where datapoints vary in relevance to the target task. However,
state-of-the-art approaches to this problem currently rely on using fixed,
unsupervised representations of the pool, focusing on modifying the acquisition
function instead. We show that this model setup can undermine their
effectiveness at dealing with messy pools, as such representations can fail to
capture important information relevant to the task. To address this, we propose
using task-driven representations that are periodically updated during the
active learning process using the previously collected labels. We introduce two
specific strategies for learning these representations, one based on directly
learning semi-supervised representations and the other based on supervised
fine-tuning of an initial unsupervised representation. We find that both
significantly improve empirical performance over using unsupervised or
pretrained representations.

### [217] [Robust GNN Watermarking via Implicit Perception of Topological Invariants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25934)
*Jipeng Li,Yannning Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InvGNN-WM是一种无触发器、黑盒验证的图神经网络水印方法，通过模型对图不变量的隐式感知来保护知识产权，在保持任务性能的同时提供高水印准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GNN水印方法大多依赖后门触发器，这些触发器在常见模型编辑下容易失效，且会造成所有权模糊问题。

Method: 使用轻量级头部预测所有者私有载体集上的归一化代数连通性，通过符号敏感解码器输出比特，并使用校准阈值控制假阳性率。

Result: 在多种节点和图分类数据集及骨干网络上，InvGNN-WM在保持清洁准确率的同时，比基于触发器和压缩的基线方法具有更高的水印准确率。在非结构化剪枝、微调和训练后量化下保持强健，普通知识蒸馏会削弱水印，而带水印损失的知识蒸馏可恢复水印。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了不可感知性和鲁棒性保证，并证明了精确移除是NP完全问题，为GNN知识产权保护提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are valuable intellectual property, yet many
watermarks rely on backdoor triggers that break under common model edits and
create ownership ambiguity. We present InvGNN-WM, which ties ownership to a
model's implicit perception of a graph invariant, enabling trigger-free,
black-box verification with negligible task impact. A lightweight head predicts
normalized algebraic connectivity on an owner-private carrier set; a
sign-sensitive decoder outputs bits, and a calibrated threshold controls the
false-positive rate. Across diverse node and graph classification datasets and
backbones, InvGNN-WM matches clean accuracy while yielding higher watermark
accuracy than trigger- and compression-based baselines. It remains strong under
unstructured pruning, fine-tuning, and post-training quantization; plain
knowledge distillation (KD) weakens the mark, while KD with a watermark loss
(KD+WM) restores it. We provide guarantees for imperceptibility and robustness,
and we prove that exact removal is NP-complete.

TL;DR: MLT是一种可逆的确定性技术，用于将高基数分类标识符编码为紧凑数值向量，通过模运算和可逆线性变换保持双射映射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统哈希或独热编码方法在处理高基数分类标识符时存在信息丢失或维度爆炸问题，需要一种既能保持可逆性又具有计算可扩展性的编码方法。

Method: 利用有限域上的模运算和可逆线性变换，构建可逆的确定性编码方法，支持维度控制和计算扩展性。

Result: 在MovieLens 20M数据集上的实验表明，MLT在预测性能上与监督嵌入方法相当，但参数数量和训练成本显著降低。

Conclusion: MLT提供了一种高效、可逆且可扩展的高基数分类标识符编码方案，优于传统方法，并已开源实现。

Abstract: This paper introduces Modular Linear Tokenization (MLT), a reversible and
deterministic technique for encoding high-cardinality categorical identifiers
into compact numerical vectors. Unlike traditional hashing or one-hot
encodings, MLT preserves bijective mappings by leveraging modular arithmetic
over finite fields and invertible linear transformations. The method offers
explicit control of dimensionality and computational scalability while
maintaining full reversibility, even for millions of identifiers. Experimental
results on the MovieLens 20M dataset show that MLT achieves comparable
predictive performance to supervised embeddings while requiring significantly
fewer parameters and lower training cost. An open-source implementation of MLT
is available on PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/light-mlt/) and GitHub
(https://github.com/tcharliesschmitz/light-mlt).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低收入和中等收入国家的常规健康数据存在报告延迟和覆盖不完整的问题，需要探索新的数据源和分析方法来提高数据可靠性。

Method: 使用XGBoost模型，基于552个健康服务区的数据，比较Google人口动态基础模型、Google AlphaEarth卫星影像和手机通话记录三种GeoFM嵌入源与传统地理插值方法的预测性能。

Result: 多源GeoFM集成模型表现最佳，在人口密度、新增HIV病例和儿童疫苗接种等指标上获得较好的预测效果，但对结核病和营养不良等数据稀缺指标的预测效果较差。

Conclusion: 多源GeoFM集成是补充和加强受限常规健康信息系统的有效且有价值的工具。

Abstract: The reliability of routine health data in low and middle-income countries
(LMICs) is often constrained by reporting delays and incomplete coverage,
necessitating the exploration of novel data sources and analytics. Geospatial
Foundation Models (GeoFMs) offer a promising avenue by synthesizing diverse
spatial, temporal, and behavioral data into mathematical embeddings that can be
efficiently used for downstream prediction tasks. This study evaluated the
predictive performance of three GeoFM embedding sources - Google Population
Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM), Google AlphaEarth (derived from satellite
imagery), and mobile phone call detail records (CDR) - for modeling 15 routine
health programmatic outputs in Malawi, and compared their utility to
traditional geospatial interpolation methods. We used XGBoost models on data
from 552 health catchment areas (January 2021-May 2023), assessing performance
with R2, and using an 80/20 training and test data split with 5-fold
cross-validation used in training. While predictive performance was mixed, the
embedding-based approaches improved upon baseline geostatistical methods in 13
of 15 (87%) indicators tested. A Multi-GeoFM model integrating all three
embedding sources produced the most robust predictions, achieving average
5-fold cross validated R2 values for indicators like population density (0.63),
new HIV cases (0.57), and child vaccinations (0.47) and test set R2 of 0.64,
0.68, and 0.55, respectively. Prediction was poor for prediction targets with
low primary data availability, such as TB and malnutrition cases. These results
demonstrate that GeoFM embeddings imbue a modest predictive improvement for
select health and demographic outcomes in an LMIC context. We conclude that the
integration of multiple GeoFM sources is an efficient and valuable tool for
supplementing and strengthening constrained routine health information systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该设置的动机源于两个关键因素：(i) 数据驱动学习方法仍不成熟，在组合优化等领域尚未展现强大结果；(ii) 训练数据可用性固有受限，如医学图像重建等科学应用。

Method: 将无数据设置分为两种变体：架构无关方法和架构特定方法，基于如何将问题实例编码到神经网络上。讨论了dNN设置与零样本学习、单样本学习、优化提升和过参数化等相关概念的异同。

Result: 虽然MLP几十年前已用于解决线性规划，但这种方法最近因在组合优化、逆问题和偏微分方程等多样化应用中展现出有前景的结果而受到越来越多的关注。

Conclusion: 本文定义了无数据设置并进行了分类，阐明了无数据神经网络设置与相关概念的区别，为该领域的研究提供了系统框架。

Abstract: This paper surveys studies on the use of neural networks for optimization in
the training-data-free setting. Specifically, we examine the dataless
application of neural network architectures in optimization by
re-parameterizing problems using fully connected (or MLP), convolutional,
graph, and quadratic neural networks. Although MLPs have been used to solve
linear programs a few decades ago, this approach has recently gained increasing
attention due to its promising results across diverse applications, including
those based on combinatorial optimization, inverse problems, and partial
differential equations. The motivation for this setting stems from two key
(possibly over-lapping) factors: (i) data-driven learning approaches are still
underdeveloped and have yet to demonstrate strong results, as seen in
combinatorial optimization, and (ii) the availability of training data is
inherently limited, such as in medical image reconstruction and other
scientific applications. In this paper, we define the dataless setting and
categorize it into two variants based on how a problem instance -- defined by a
single datum -- is encoded onto the neural network: (i) architecture-agnostic
methods and (ii) architecture-specific methods. Additionally, we discuss
similarities and clarify distinctions between the dataless neural network (dNN)
settings and related concepts such as zero-shot learning, one-shot learning,
lifting in optimization, and over-parameterization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文指出InfoNCE不是有效的互信息估计器，提出了InfoNCE-anchor改进方法，通过引入辅助锚点类实现更准确的互信息估计，并建立了基于评分规则的统一框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: InfoNCE目标函数虽然广泛用于对比表示学习和互信息估计，但其与互信息的间接联系使其不适合作为有效的互信息估计器。

Method: 引入辅助锚点类进行一致的密度比估计，提出InfoNCE-anchor方法，并使用适当的评分规则将多种对比目标统一到一个理论框架中。

Result: InfoNCE-anchor在互信息估计中显著减少偏差，但在自监督表示学习中并未改善下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 对比表示学习的优势不在于准确的互信息估计本身，而在于学习结构化的密度比。

Abstract: The InfoNCE objective, originally introduced for contrastive representation
learning, has become a popular choice for mutual information (MI) estimation,
despite its indirect connection to MI. In this paper, we demonstrate why
InfoNCE should not be regarded as a valid MI estimator, and we introduce a
simple modification, which we refer to as InfoNCE-anchor, for accurate MI
estimation. Our modification introduces an auxiliary anchor class, enabling
consistent density ratio estimation and yielding a plug-in MI estimator with
significantly reduced bias. Beyond this, we generalize our framework using
proper scoring rules, which recover InfoNCE-anchor as a special case when the
log score is employed. This formulation unifies a broad spectrum of contrastive
objectives, including NCE, InfoNCE, and $f$-divergence variants, under a single
principled framework. Empirically, we find that InfoNCE-anchor with the log
score achieves the most accurate MI estimates; however, in self-supervised
representation learning experiments, we find that the anchor does not improve
the downstream task performance. These findings corroborate that contrastive
representation learning benefits not from accurate MI estimation per se, but
from the learning of structured density ratios.

Motivation: 解决约束优化问题微分在机器学习、控制和大规模决策系统中的集成挑战，克服求解器专业化和接口不匹配问题。

Method: 在标准正则性假设下对KKT系统进行微分，提供JuMP原生参数中心API，允许用户声明命名参数并直接获取导数，即使参数出现在多个约束和目标中。

Conclusion: 可微优化可以作为实验、学习、校准和设计的常规工具部署，无需偏离标准JuMP建模实践，同时保留对广泛求解器生态系统的访问。

Abstract: Differentiating through constrained optimization problems is increasingly
central to learning, control, and large-scale decision-making systems, yet
practical integration remains challenging due to solver specialization and
interface mismatches. This paper presents a general and streamlined
framework-an updated DiffOpt.jl-that unifies modeling and differentiation
within the Julia optimization stack. The framework computes forward - and
reverse-mode solution and objective sensitivities for smooth, potentially
nonconvex programs by differentiating the KKT system under standard regularity
assumptions. A first-class, JuMP-native parameter-centric API allows users to
declare named parameters and obtain derivatives directly with respect to them -
even when a parameter appears in multiple constraints and objectives -
eliminating brittle bookkeeping from coefficient-level interfaces. We
illustrate these capabilities on convex and nonconvex models, including
economic dispatch, mean-variance portfolio selection with conic risk
constraints, and nonlinear robot inverse kinematics. Two companion studies
further demonstrate impact at scale: gradient-based iterative methods for
strategic bidding in energy markets and Sobolev-style training of end-to-end
optimization proxies using solver-accurate sensitivities. Together, these
results demonstrate that differentiable optimization can be deployed as a
routine tool for experimentation, learning, calibration, and design-without
deviating from standard JuMP modeling practices and while retaining access to a
broad ecosystem of solvers.

Motivation: 边缘机器人系统需要高效的在线学习算法来持续适应变化的环境，传统反向传播与生物合理性原则冲突且可能不适合连续适应场景。

Method: 基于预测编码框架，提出PCN-TA方法，通过时间摊销机制保留跨时间帧的潜在状态，减少推理迭代次数。

Result: 在COIL-20机器人感知数据集上，PCN-TA比反向传播减少10%权重更新，比基线PC网络减少50%推理步骤。

Conclusion: PCN-TA显著降低计算开销，为边缘部署和实时适应支持迈出重要一步，其生物启发性使其成为未来神经形态硬件实现的有前景候选方案。

Abstract: Robotic systems operating at the edge require efficient online learning
algorithms that can continuously adapt to changing environments while
processing streaming sensory data. Traditional backpropagation, while
effective, conflicts with biological plausibility principles and may be
suboptimal for continuous adaptation scenarios. The Predictive Coding (PC)
framework offers a biologically plausible alternative with local, Hebbian-like
update rules, making it suitable for neuromorphic hardware implementation.
However, PC's main limitation is its computational overhead due to multiple
inference iterations during training. We present Predictive Coding Network with
Temporal Amortization (PCN-TA), which preserves latent states across temporal
frames. By leveraging temporal correlations, PCN-TA significantly reduces
computational demands while maintaining learning performance. Our experiments
on the COIL-20 robotic perception dataset demonstrate that PCN-TA achieves 10%
fewer weight updates compared to backpropagation and requires 50% fewer
inference steps than baseline PC networks. These efficiency gains directly
translate to reduced computational overhead for moving another step toward edge
deployment and real-time adaptation support in resource-constrained robotic
systems. The biologically-inspired nature of our approach also makes it a
promising candidate for future neuromorphic hardware implementations, enabling
efficient online learning at the edge.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了INFEX框架，用于解决线性bandit中探索频率不足的问题。该框架在给定时间表执行基础探索策略，其余时间选择贪婪动作，实现了探索频率与性能的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决完全自适应探索方法（如UCB和Thompson Sampling）需要持续探索，而纯贪婪方法需要严格多样性假设才能成功的问题。在安全关键或成本高昂的领域中，持续探索可能不切实际或不道德。

Method: 引入INFEX框架，按照预定时间表执行基础探索策略，在探索间隔期间主要选择贪婪动作。这是一个通用模块化框架，可以无缝集成任何完全自适应的探索方法。

Result: 理论分析表明，只要探索频率超过对数阈值，INFEX就能实现与标准可证明高效算法相匹配的实例依赖遗憾。实证评估证实了理论发现，显示出最先进的遗憾性能和运行时间改进。

Conclusion: INFEX是一个简单实用的框架，成功桥接了完全自适应探索和纯贪婪方法之间的差距，在限制探索频率的同时保持了良好的性能，并提高了计算效率。

Abstract: We study the problem of infrequent exploration in linear bandits, addressing
a significant yet overlooked gap between fully adaptive exploratory methods
(e.g., UCB and Thompson Sampling), which explore potentially at every time
step, and purely greedy approaches, which require stringent diversity
assumptions to succeed. Continuous exploration can be impractical or unethical
in safety-critical or costly domains, while purely greedy strategies typically
fail without adequate contextual diversity. To bridge these extremes, we
introduce a simple and practical framework, INFEX, explicitly designed for
infrequent exploration. INFEX executes a base exploratory policy according to a
given schedule while predominantly choosing greedy actions in between. Despite
its simplicity, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that INFEX achieves
instance-dependent regret matching standard provably efficient algorithms,
provided the exploration frequency exceeds a logarithmic threshold.
Additionally, INFEX is a general, modular framework that allows seamless
integration of any fully adaptive exploration method, enabling wide
applicability and ease of adoption. By restricting intensive exploratory
computations to infrequent intervals, our approach can also enhance
computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations confirm our theoretical
findings, showing state-of-the-art regret performance and runtime improvements
over existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生存分析需要同时建模患者异质性、个体特征和时间动态，现有方法难以灵活整合这些因素。

Method: 使用双MoE框架：特征编码器MoE用于亚组感知表示学习，风险MoE利用患者特征和时间嵌入捕捉时间动态。

Result: 在METABRIC和GBSG乳腺癌数据集上，时间依赖C指数在测试集上提升高达0.04，在Consurv框架中进一步增益。

Conclusion: 双MoE框架能有效提升生存分析性能，灵活整合现有深度学习生存分析流程。

Abstract: Survival analysis is a task to model the time until an event of interest
occurs, widely used in clinical and biomedical research. A key challenge is to
model patient heterogeneity while also adapting risk predictions to both
individual characteristics and temporal dynamics. We propose a dual
mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for discrete-time survival analysis. Our
approach combines a feature-encoder MoE for subgroup-aware representation
learning with a hazard MoE that leverages patient features and time embeddings
to capture temporal dynamics. This dual-MoE design flexibly integrates with
existing deep learning based survival pipelines. On METABRIC and GBSG breast
cancer datasets, our method consistently improves performance, boosting the
time-dependent C-index up to 0.04 on the test sets, and yields further gains
when incorporated into the Consurv framework.

Abstract: Do AI systems truly understand human concepts or merely mimic surface
patterns? We investigate this through chess, where human creativity meets
precise strategic concepts. Analyzing a 270M-parameter transformer that
achieves grandmaster-level play, we uncover a striking paradox: while early
layers encode human concepts like center control and knight outposts with up to
85\% accuracy, deeper layers, despite driving superior performance, drift
toward alien representations, dropping to 50-65\% accuracy. To test conceptual
robustness beyond memorization, we introduce the first Chess960 dataset: 240
expert-annotated positions across 6 strategic concepts. When opening theory is
eliminated through randomized starting positions, concept recognition drops
10-20\% across all methods, revealing the model's reliance on memorized
patterns rather than abstract understanding. Our layer-wise analysis exposes a
fundamental tension in current architectures: the representations that win
games diverge from those that align with human thinking. These findings suggest
that as AI systems optimize for performance, they develop increasingly alien
intelligence, a critical challenge for creative AI applications requiring
genuine human-AI collaboration. Dataset and code are available at:

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for model compression and
transferring knowledge between models. However, its effect on model's
robustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on
out-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the
effect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''
capabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language
inference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,
we illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a
model is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit
from injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a
model may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur
across different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention
pattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above
findings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of
debiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing
iterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights
obtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.
Our findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better
debiasing methods.

Motivation: 符号回归旨在从观测数据中发现数学表达式，但深度学习方法的缩放效应尚未被系统研究。受语言模型缩放定律启发，本文探索符号回归中的缩放规律。

Method: 使用可扩展的端到端Transformer流水线和精心生成的训练数据，在五个不同模型规模和三个数量级的计算量范围内进行系统实验。

Conclusion: 符号回归性能主要可由计算量预测，这些发现为训练下一代SR模型提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover the underlying mathematical
expressions that explain observed data. This holds promise for both gaining
scientific insight and for producing inherently interpretable and generalizable
models for tabular data. In this work we focus on the basics of SR. Deep
learning-based SR has recently become competitive with genetic programming
approaches, but the role of scale has remained largely unexplored. Inspired by
scaling laws in language modeling, we present the first systematic
investigation of scaling in SR, using a scalable end-to-end transformer
pipeline and carefully generated training data. Across five different model
sizes and spanning three orders of magnitude in compute, we find that both
validation loss and solved rate follow clear power-law trends with compute. We
further identify compute-optimal hyperparameter scaling: optimal batch size and
learning rate grow with model size, and a token-to-parameter ratio of
$\approx$15 is optimal in our regime, with a slight upward trend as compute
increases. These results demonstrate that SR performance is largely predictable
from compute and offer important insights for training the next generation of

### [229] [Learning Geometry: A Framework for Building Adaptive Manifold Models through Metric Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26068)
*Di Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种超越传统参数优化的机器学习新范式，将模型本身视为可塑的几何实体，通过优化预定义拓扑流形上的度量张量场来动态塑造模型空间的几何结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习方法在固定几何空间中搜索最优参数存在局限性，需要一种能够动态调整模型几何结构的新方法，以提升模型表达能力和防止过拟合。

Method: 构建变分框架，损失函数平衡数据保真度和流形内在几何复杂度；使用离散微分几何方法，将连续流形离散化为三角网格，通过边长度参数化度量张量，利用自动微分工具进行高效优化。

Result: 理论分析揭示了该框架与广义相对论中爱因斯坦-希尔伯特作用的深刻类比，为"数据驱动几何"概念提供了优雅物理解释；即使固定拓扑，度量优化也比固定几何模型具有更强的表达能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作为构建能够自主演化几何和拓扑的完全动态"元学习器"奠定了坚实基础，在科学模型发现和鲁棒表示学习等领域具有广阔应用前景。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel paradigm for machine learning that moves beyond
traditional parameter optimization. Unlike conventional approaches that search
for optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to
treat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we
optimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology,
thereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To
achieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function
carefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of
the manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,
while the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular
geometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the
computational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we
introduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the
continuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric
tensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using
automatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound
analogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general
relativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of
"data-driven geometry". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric
optimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with
fixed geometry. This work lays a solid foundation for constructing fully
dynamic "meta-learners" capable of autonomously evolving their geometry and
topology, and it points to broad application prospects in areas such as
scientific model discovery and robust representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据生成是解决金融数据敏感性和监管约束的有前景方法，但该领域缺乏对当前研究现状的综合分析。

Method: 系统综述方法，对72项研究进行分类分析，涵盖生成的金融信息类型、生成方法和评估策略。

Result: GAN方法在文献中占主导地位，特别是在时间序列市场数据和表格信用数据生成方面。虽然创新技术显示出改进真实性和隐私保护的潜力，但隐私保障的严格评估普遍缺乏。

Conclusion: 该综述提供了生成技术、应用和评估方法的综合概览，指出了关键研究空白，并为开发稳健的隐私保护合成数据解决方案提供了指导。

Abstract: Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising approach to address the
challenges of using sensitive financial data in machine learning applications.
By leveraging generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), it is possible to create artificial
datasets that preserve the statistical properties of real financial records
while mitigating privacy risks and regulatory constraints. Despite the rapid
growth of this field, a comprehensive synthesis of the current research
landscape has been lacking. This systematic review consolidates and analyses 72
studies published since 2018 that focus on synthetic financial data generation.
We categorise the types of financial information synthesised, the generative
methods employed, and the evaluation strategies used to assess data utility and
privacy. The findings indicate that GAN-based approaches dominate the
literature, particularly for generating time-series market data and tabular
credit data. While several innovative techniques demonstrate potential for
improved realism and privacy preservation, there remains a notable lack of
rigorous evaluation of privacy safeguards across studies. By providing an
integrated overview of generative techniques, applications, and evaluation
methods, this review highlights critical research gaps and offers guidance for
future work aimed at developing robust, privacy-preserving synthetic data
solutions for the financial domain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Nirvana模型，这是一种具有专门记忆机制、线性时间复杂度和测试时任务信息提取能力的专业化通用模型。通过任务感知记忆触发器和专门记忆更新器，模型能够根据任务需求灵活调整记忆机制并适应领域变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM结构（包括Transformer、线性注意力和混合模型）缺乏由任务信息引导的专门记忆机制。为了解决这个问题，需要开发能够保持广泛能力同时在目标领域达到专家级性能的专业化通用模型。

Method: 设计了任务感知记忆触发器（Trigger）和专门记忆更新器（Updater）。Trigger根据当前任务需求灵活调整记忆机制，将每个输入样本视为自监督微调任务；Updater在Trigger引导下动态记忆上下文。在MRI任务中，使用轻量级编解码器对冻结的Nirvana骨干进行后训练。

Result: 在各种自然语言建模基准测试中，Nirvana取得了与现有LLM结构相当或更优的结果。在具有挑战性的MRI任务上，Nirvana相比传统MRI模型和传统LLM骨干模型实现了更高质量的MRI重建，并能生成准确的初步临床报告。

Conclusion: Nirvana通过专门的记忆机制成功实现了专业化通用模型的目标，在保持广泛能力的同时在特定领域达到专家级性能，特别是在医疗影像重建任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Specialized Generalist Models (SGMs) aim to preserve broad capabilities while
achieving expert-level performance in target domains. However, traditional LLM
structures including Transformer, Linear Attention, and hybrid models do not
employ specialized memory mechanism guided by task information. In this paper,
we present Nirvana, an SGM with specialized memory mechanism, linear time
complexity, and test-time task information extraction. Besides, we propose the
Task-Aware Memory Trigger ($\textit{Trigger}$) that flexibly adjusts memory
mechanism based on the current task's requirements. In Trigger, each incoming
sample is treated as a self-supervised fine-tuning task, enabling Nirvana to
adapt its task-related parameters on the fly to domain shifts. We also design
the Specialized Memory Updater ($\textit{Updater}$) that dynamically memorizes
the context guided by Trigger. We conduct experiments on both general language
tasks and specialized medical tasks. On a variety of natural language modeling
benchmarks, Nirvana achieves competitive or superior results compared to the
existing LLM structures. To prove the effectiveness of Trigger on specialized
tasks, we test Nirvana's performance on a challenging medical task, i.e.,
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). We post-train frozen Nirvana backbone with
lightweight codecs on paired electromagnetic signals and MRI images. Despite
the frozen Nirvana backbone, Trigger guides the model to adapt to the MRI
domain with the change of task-related parameters. Nirvana achieves
higher-quality MRI reconstruction compared to conventional MRI models as well
as the models with traditional LLMs' backbone, and can also generate accurate
preliminary clinical reports accordingly.

### [232] [LLMBisect: Breaking Barriers in Bug Bisection with A Comparative Analysis Pipeline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26086)
*Zheng Zhang,Haonan Li,Xingyu Li,Hang Zhang,Zhiyun Qian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型的多阶段bug二分法管道，通过充分利用补丁信息、比较多个候选提交以及逐步缩小候选范围，显著提高了bug引入提交识别的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于补丁的二分法存在多个限制：假设bug引入提交和补丁提交修改相同函数、仅依赖代码变更而忽略提交消息中的漏洞信息、基于简单启发式方法缺乏逻辑分析。大语言模型能够理解文本和代码，有望突破这些限制。

Method: 设计了一个全面的多阶段管道，利用大语言模型：(1)充分利用补丁信息，(2)在上下文中比较多个候选提交，(3)通过一系列筛选步骤逐步缩小候选范围。

Result: 评估显示该方法比最先进解决方案的准确率提高了38%以上，多阶段管道相比基线LLM二分法准确率提高了60%。

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的多阶段管道能够有效克服传统bug二分法的限制，显著提高bug引入提交识别的准确性。

Abstract: Bug bisection has been an important security task that aims to understand the
range of software versions impacted by a bug, i.e., identifying the commit that
introduced the bug. However, traditional patch-based bisection methods are
faced with several significant barriers: For example, they assume that the
bug-inducing commit (BIC) and the patch commit modify the same functions, which
is not always true. They often rely solely on code changes, while the commit
message frequently contains a wealth of vulnerability-related information. They
are also based on simple heuristics (e.g., assuming the BIC initializes lines
deleted in the patch) and lack any logical analysis of the vulnerability.
  In this paper, we make the observation that Large Language Models (LLMs) are
well-positioned to break the barriers of existing solutions, e.g., comprehend
both textual data and code in patches and commits. Unlike previous BIC
identification approaches, which yield poor results, we propose a comprehensive
multi-stage pipeline that leverages LLMs to: (1) fully utilize patch
information, (2) compare multiple candidate commits in context, and (3)
progressively narrow down the candidates through a series of down-selection
steps. In our evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves
significantly better accuracy than the state-of-the-art solution by more than
38\%. Our results further confirm that the comprehensive multi-stage pipeline
is essential, as it improves accuracy by 60\% over a baseline LLM-based
bisection method.

*Fazel Arasteh,Arian Haghparast,Manos Papagelis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出两种基于多智能体强化学习的动态车辆路由方法：自适应导航(AN)和分层枢纽自适应导航(HHAN)，用于缓解城市交通拥堵。AN使用图注意力网络建模局部交通状态，HHAN通过枢纽节点分层协调实现大规模网络扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统最短路径优先算法在动态多车辆环境中表现不佳，会因所有车辆选择相同路径而加剧拥堵。需要开发能够协调多车辆、考虑网络状态的动态路由方法。

Method: AN：去中心化MARL模型，每个交叉口智能体基于局部交通和图注意力网络建模的邻域状态提供路由指导。HHAN：AN的扩展，仅在关键枢纽节点部署智能体，采用集中训练分散执行框架和注意力Q混合方法协调异步车辆决策。

Result: 在合成网格和真实城市地图上的实验表明，AN相比SPF和学习基线减少了平均旅行时间，保持100%路由成功率。HHAN可扩展到数百个交叉口的网络，在重交通下实现高达15.9%的改进。

Conclusion: 网络约束的多智能体强化学习在智能交通系统中具有实现可扩展、协调和拥堵感知路由的潜力。

Abstract: Traffic congestion in urban road networks leads to longer trip times and
higher emissions, especially during peak periods. While the Shortest Path First
(SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it
performs poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion
by routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle
routing through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for
coordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive
Navigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent
provides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood
state modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in
large networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation
(HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections
(hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles
micro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts
centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive
Q-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions
via attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local
congestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing. Experiments on
synthetic grids and real urban maps (Toronto, Manhattan) show that AN reduces
average travel time versus SPF and learning baselines, maintaining 100% routing
success. HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up
to 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic. These findings highlight the
potential of network-constrained MARL for scalable, coordinated, and
congestion-aware routing in intelligent transportation systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAFE是一个用于评估地球预测模型分层性能的开源工具包，通过按国家、地区、收入水平和土地覆盖等属性分层分析，揭示AI天气预测模型在不同地理区域的表现差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习评估基于测试集平均损失，这在地球科学中忽略了人类发展和地理分布的不均匀性，无法反映模型在不同地区的实际表现差异。

Method: 开发SAFE工具包，整合多种数据域，按领土、全球子区域、收入和土地覆盖等属性对地理网格点进行分层，分析每个分层内的模型性能。

Result: 对多个最先进的AI天气预测模型进行基准测试，发现所有模型在所有属性上都表现出预测技能的不均衡性，建立了不同提前期和气候变量的模型预测公平性基准。

Conclusion: 通过超越全局平均指标，首次能够回答模型在哪些地方表现最佳或最差，以及哪些模型最公平的问题，为更全面的模型评估提供了新方法。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in machine learning is to assess model performance
based on average loss across all samples in some test set. This amounts to
averaging performance geospatially across the Earth in weather and climate
settings, failing to account for the non-uniform distribution of human
development and geography. We introduce Stratified Assessments of Forecasts
over Earth (SAFE), a package for elucidating the stratified performance of a
set of predictions made over Earth. SAFE integrates various data domains to
stratify by different attributes associated with geospatial gridpoints:
territory (usually country), global subregion, income, and landcover (land or
water). This allows us to examine the performance of models for each individual
stratum of the different attributes (e.g., the accuracy in every individual
country). To demonstrate its importance, we utilize SAFE to benchmark a zoo of
state-of-the-art AI-based weather prediction models, finding that they all
exhibit disparities in forecasting skill across every attribute. We use this to
seed a benchmark of model forecast fairness through stratification at different
lead times for various climatic variables. By moving beyond globally-averaged
metrics, we for the first time ask: where do models perform best or worst, and
which models are most fair? To support further work in this direction, the SAFE
package is open source and available at https://github.com/N-Masi/safe

TL;DR: 提出LTE方法，通过让LLMs从自身生成的错误答案和过长响应中学习，解决RLVR中的探索停滞问题，无需外部专家指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法仅基于LLMs自身生成的响应进行训练，受限于初始能力，容易陷入探索停滞，无法解决更多训练问题。

Method: LTE方法通过提示LLMs其先前生成的错误答案和过长响应问题，让模型从试错中学习推理能力。

Result: 在六个数学基准测试中，LTE比普通GRPO在Pass@1上平均提升6.38，在Pass@k上平均提升9.00。

Conclusion: LTE成功缓解了探索停滞问题，增强了训练过程中的利用和探索能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has significantly
boosted the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) recently.
However, existing RLVR approaches merely train LLMs based on their own
generated responses and are constrained by the initial capability of LLMs, thus
prone to exploration stagnation, in which LLMs fail to solve more training
problems and cannot further learn from the training data. Some work tries to
address this by leveraging off-policy solutions to training problems but
requires external guidance from experts which suffers from limited
availability. In this work, we propose LTE (Learning to reason from Trial and
Error), an approach hinting LLMs with their previously self-generated incorrect
answers and problem of overlong responses, which does not require any external
expert guidance. Experiments validate the effectiveness of LTE, which
outperforms the normal group relative policy optimization (GRPO) by 6.38 in
Pass@1 and 9.00 in Pass@k on average across six mathematics benchmarks for
Qwen3-4B-Base. Further analysis confirms that LTE successfully mitigates the
problem of exploration stagnation and enhances both exploitation and
exploration during training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WiFi CSI活动识别在边缘设备部署时面临域偏移问题，识别性能会因环境和硬件条件变化而显著下降，需要一种自主适应机制来维持长期稳定的识别性能。

Method: 采用跨模态师生架构，使用高精度YOLO视觉模型作为动态监督信号，为CSI数据流提供实时活动标签，在线微调轻量级CSI活动识别模型STAR。

Result: 在未校准硬件上，基线STAR模型准确率从93.52%降至49.14%，经过一次视觉引导适应周期后，maxVSTAR将准确率恢复至81.51%。

Conclusion: maxVSTAR在隐私敏感的物联网环境中实现了动态、自监督的模型自适应，为网络边缘的长期自主CSI活动识别建立了可扩展的实用范式。

Abstract: WiFi Channel State Information (CSI)-based human activity recognition (HAR)
provides a privacy-preserving, device-free sensing solution for smart
environments. However, its deployment on edge devices is severely constrained
by domain shift, where recognition performance deteriorates under varying
environmental and hardware conditions. This study presents maxVSTAR (maximally
adaptive Vision-guided Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), a
closed-loop, vision-guided model adaptation framework that autonomously
mitigates domain shift for edge-deployed CSI sensing systems. The proposed
system integrates a cross-modal teacher-student architecture, where a
high-accuracy YOLO-based vision model serves as a dynamic supervisory signal,
delivering real-time activity labels for the CSI data stream. These labels
enable autonomous, online fine-tuning of a lightweight CSI-based HAR model,
termed Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition (STAR), directly at the
edge. This closed-loop retraining mechanism allows STAR to continuously adapt
to environmental changes without manual intervention. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of maxVSTAR. When deployed on uncalibrated
hardware, the baseline STAR model's recognition accuracy declined from 93.52%
to 49.14%. Following a single vision-guided adaptation cycle, maxVSTAR restored
the accuracy to 81.51%. These results confirm the system's capacity for
dynamic, self-supervised model adaptation in privacy-conscious IoT
environments, establishing a scalable and practical paradigm for long-term
autonomous HAR using CSI sensing at the network edge.

Motivation: 现有Wi-Fi CSI活动识别方法在资源受限的移动边缘环境中存在计算效率低、延迟高和可行性有限的问题，需要开发适合嵌入式设备的实时高效解决方案。

Conclusion: STAR框架提供了实时、隐私保护、低功耗的人类活动识别解决方案，适用于移动和普适计算环境，具有实际应用和可扩展性。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) via Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI)
presents a privacy-preserving, contactless sensing approach suitable for smart
homes, healthcare monitoring, and mobile IoT systems. However, existing methods
often encounter computational inefficiency, high latency, and limited
feasibility within resource-constrained, embedded mobile edge environments.
This paper proposes STAR (Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), an
edge-AI-optimized framework that integrates a lightweight neural architecture,
adaptive signal processing, and hardware-aware co-optimization to enable
real-time, energy-efficient HAR on low-power embedded devices. STAR
incorporates a streamlined Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based recurrent neural
network, reducing model parameters by 33% compared to conventional LSTM models
while maintaining effective temporal modeling capability. A multi-stage
pre-processing pipeline combining median filtering, 8th-order Butterworth
low-pass filtering, and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is employed to
denoise CSI amplitude data and extract spatial-temporal features. For on-device
deployment, STAR is implemented on a Rockchip RV1126 processor equipped with an
embedded Neural Processing Unit (NPU), interfaced with an ESP32-S3-based CSI
acquisition module. Experimental results demonstrate a mean recognition
accuracy of 93.52% across seven activity classes and 99.11% for human presence
detection, utilizing a compact 97.6k-parameter model. INT8 quantized inference
achieves a processing speed of 33 MHz with just 8% CPU utilization, delivering
sixfold speed improvements over CPU-based execution. With sub-second response
latency and low power consumption, the system ensures real-time,
privacy-preserving HAR, offering a practical, scalable solution for mobile and
pervasive computing environments.

Motivation: 现有模型难以捕捉分子与其描述之间的细微差异，缺乏学习分子子结构与化学短语之间细粒度对齐的能力。

Method: 通过分子子结构和化学短语的额外对齐信号增强原始分子-描述对，采用子结构感知对比学习结合自精炼机制过滤噪声对齐信号。

Result: 实验结果表明MolBridge有效捕捉细粒度对应关系，在多个分子基准测试中优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 子结构感知对齐在分子-文本学习中具有重要意义，MolBridge框架展示了其有效性。

Abstract: Molecule and text representation learning has gained increasing interest due
to its potential for enhancing the understanding of chemical information.
However, existing models often struggle to capture subtle differences between
molecules and their descriptions, as they lack the ability to learn
fine-grained alignments between molecular substructures and chemical phrases.
To address this limitation, we introduce MolBridge, a novel molecule-text
learning framework based on substructure-aware alignments. Specifically, we
augment the original molecule-description pairs with additional alignment
signals derived from molecular substructures and chemical phrases. To
effectively learn from these enriched alignments, MolBridge employs
substructure-aware contrastive learning, coupled with a self-refinement
mechanism that filters out noisy alignment signals. Experimental results show
that MolBridge effectively captures fine-grained correspondences and
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a wide range of molecular benchmarks,
highlighting the significance of substructure-aware alignment in molecule-text
learning.

Result: 复杂方法表现不佳，而简单集成模型实现了0.976的AUC-ROC、0.41的F1分数，并在定义时间窗口内实现了100%的早期检测。

Conclusion: 在高度不平衡和时间不确定的数据场景中，模型简单性结合优化分段可以胜过更复杂的架构，提供更好的鲁棒性、可解释性和操作实用性。

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of advanced feature
engineering and hybrid model architectures for anomaly detection in a
multivariate industrial time series, focusing on a steam turbine system. We
evaluate the impact of change point-derived statistical features,
clustering-based substructure representations, and hybrid learning strategies
on detection performance. Despite their theoretical appeal, these complex
approaches consistently underperformed compared to a simple Random Forest +
XGBoost ensemble trained on segmented data. The ensemble achieved an AUC-ROC of
0.976, F1-score of 0.41, and 100% early detection within the defined time
window. Our findings highlight that, in scenarios with highly imbalanced and
temporally uncertain data, model simplicity combined with optimized
segmentation can outperform more sophisticated architectures, offering greater

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公共资源分配方法独立优化单个资源移动，未考虑容量约束，需要更实用的协作分配方法。

Method: 将CPRA建模为势博弈，证明势函数与最优目标无间隙，设计GSTRL框架捕捉系统时空动态。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上评估，GSTRL表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: GSTRL为CPRA问题提供了理论基础和有效解决方案，在真实场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Public resource allocation involves the efficient distribution of resources,
including urban infrastructure, energy, and transportation, to effectively meet
societal demands. However, existing methods focus on optimizing the movement of
individual resources independently, without considering their capacity
constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and more practical
problem: Collaborative Public Resource Allocation (CPRA), which explicitly
incorporates capacity constraints and spatio-temporal dynamics in real-world
scenarios. We propose a new framework called Game-Theoretic Spatio-Temporal
Reinforcement Learning (GSTRL) for solving CPRA. Our contributions are twofold:
1) We formulate the CPRA problem as a potential game and demonstrate that there
is no gap between the potential function and the optimal target, laying a solid
theoretical foundation for approximating the Nash equilibrium of this NP-hard
problem; and 2) Our designed GSTRL framework effectively captures the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the overall system. We evaluate GSTRL on two
real-world datasets, where experiments show its superior performance. Our
source codes are available in the supplementary materials.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出ACC-SGD-IE方法，通过累积影响状态跟踪跨训练周期的留一扰动，相比标准SGD-IE能更准确地估计样本影响力，特别是在长周期训练中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准SGD-IE方法通过累加每周期代理项来近似留一影响，但忽略了跨周期复合效应，导致对关键样本的错误排序。

Method: ACC-SGD-IE是一种轨迹感知估计器，在训练过程中传播留一扰动，并在每一步更新累积影响状态。

Result: 在平滑强凸设置中实现几何误差收缩，在平滑非凸机制中收紧误差界限；更大批次进一步减少常数。在多个数据集上实验表明ACC-SGD-IE产生更准确的影响估计。

Conclusion: ACC-SGD-IE在下游数据清洗中更可靠地标记噪声样本，使用其清洗数据训练的模型优于使用SGD-IE清洗的模型。

Abstract: Modern data-centric AI needs precise per-sample influence. Standard SGD-IE
approximates leave-one-out effects by summing per-epoch surrogates and ignores
cross-epoch compounding, which misranks critical examples. We propose
ACC-SGD-IE, a trajectory-aware estimator that propagates the leave-one-out
perturbation across training and updates an accumulative influence state at
each step. In smooth strongly convex settings it achieves geometric error
contraction and, in smooth non-convex regimes, it tightens error bounds; larger
mini-batches further reduce constants. Empirically, on Adult, 20 Newsgroups,
and MNIST under clean and corrupted data and both convex and non-convex
training, ACC-SGD-IE yields more accurate influence estimates, especially over
long epochs. For downstream data cleansing it more reliably flags noisy
samples, producing models trained on ACC-SGD-IE cleaned data that outperform

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低可预防的医院再入院率是医疗支付方、提供者和政策制定者的重要目标，再入院率已成为衡量医院医疗质量的基准指标。

Method: 使用逻辑回归、随机森林和支持向量机等机器学习技术分析健康索赔数据，采用主成分分析进行降维处理，基于AUC指标评估模型性能。

Result: 随机森林模型表现最佳，其次是逻辑回归和支持向量机模型，这些模型能识别导致再入院的关键因素。

Conclusion: 机器学习模型可用于识别再入院的关键因素，帮助医疗机构重点关注高风险患者，从而降低再入院率和医疗成本，提高医疗质量。

Abstract: Reducing preventable hospital readmissions is a national priority for payers,
providers, and policymakers seeking to improve health care and lower costs. The
rate of readmission is being used as a benchmark to determine the quality of
healthcare provided by the hospitals. In thisproject, we have used machine
learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector
Machines to analyze the health claims data and identify demographic and medical
factors that play a crucial role in predicting all-cause readmissions. As the
health claims data is high dimensional, we have used Principal Component
Analysis as a dimension reduction technique and used the results for building
regression models. We compared and evaluated these models based on the Area
Under Curve (AUC) metric. Random Forest model gave the highest performance
followed by Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models. These models
can be used to identify the crucial factors causing readmissions and help
identify patients to focus on to reduce the chances of readmission, ultimately
bringing down the cost and increasing the quality of healthcare provided to the
patients.

Method: 基于随机控制输入的采样模型预测控制，在预logits层应用高斯扰动，通过重要性采样获得最优均值。

Result: AISP在样本使用数量方面优于最佳n采样，并且比其他基于奖励的测试时对齐方法获得更高的奖励。

Conclusion: AISP是一种有效的测试时对齐方法，能够在不需要微调的情况下优化模型性能。

Abstract: Test-time alignment of large language models (LLMs) attracts attention
because fine-tuning LLMs requires high computational costs. In this paper, we
propose a new test-time alignment method called adaptive importance sampling on
pre-logits (AISP) on the basis of the sampling-based model predictive control
with the stochastic control input. AISP applies the Gaussian perturbation into
pre-logits, which are outputs of the penultimate layer, so as to maximize
expected rewards with respect to the mean of the perturbation. We demonstrate
that the optimal mean is obtained by importance sampling with sampled rewards.
AISP outperforms best-of-n sampling in terms of rewards over the number of used
samples and achieves higher rewards than other reward-based test-time alignment
methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于归纳方法的机器学习遗忘解决方案，通过在模型末端添加投影重分布层来实现知识移除，无需访问原始数据集或完整模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习遗忘方法存在可扩展性问题，需要访问完整原始数据集和模型，难以在实际场景中部署。

Method: 将分类训练视为顺序学习过程，通过反转最后训练序列实现遗忘，在模型末端添加投影重分布层作为输出过滤器。

Result: 在多个数据集（CIFAR-10/100、Covertype）上的实验表明，该方法输出与完全重训练模型相似，同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 该方法具有适用性、可扩展性和系统兼容性，在保持性能的同时提供了更实用的机器学习遗忘解决方案。

Abstract: As a new and promising approach, existing machine unlearning (MU) works
typically emphasize theoretical formulations or optimization objectives to
achieve knowledge removal. However, when deployed in real-world scenarios, such
solutions typically face scalability issues and have to address practical
requirements such as full access to original datasets and model. In contrast to
the existing approaches, we regard classification training as a sequential
process where classes are learned sequentially, which we call \emph{inductive
approach}. Unlearning can then be done by reversing the last training sequence.
This is implemented by appending a projection-redistribution layer in the end
of the model. Such an approach does not require full access to the original
dataset or the model, addressing the challenges of existing methods. This
enables modular and model-agnostic deployment as an output filter into existing
classification pipelines with minimal alterations. We conducted multiple
experiments across multiple datasets including image (CIFAR-10/100 using
CNN-based model) and tabular datasets (Covertype using tree-based model).
Experiment results show consistently similar output to a fully retrained model
with a high computational cost reduction. This demonstrates the applicability,
scalability, and system compatibility of our solution while maintaining the
performance of the output in a more practical setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有行为调控方法局限于二维子空间，对参数敏感且可能影响无关特征，需要更灵活稳定的调控方法

Method: 将行为调控建模为几何旋转，在固定二维子空间内旋转激活向量，还提出了自适应变体仅旋转与目标特征对齐的激活

Result: 在多个模型家族和尺寸上的实验表明，Angular Steering实现了鲁棒的行为控制，同时保持通用语言建模性能

Conclusion: Angular Steering在灵活性、泛化性和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法，为安全可靠AI部署提供了有效的行为调控框架

Abstract: Controlling specific behaviors in large language models while preserving
their general capabilities is a central challenge for safe and reliable
artificial intelligence deployment. Current steering methods, such as vector
addition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional
subspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive
to chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to
unintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a
novel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating
activations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as
a geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular
Steering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as
refusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering
emotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular
Steering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the
target feature, further enhancing stability and coherence. Angular Steering
generalizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified
geometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining
model stability across a broader range of adjustments. Experiments across
multiple model families and sizes show that Angular Steering achieves robust
behavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance,
underscoring its flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior
approaches. Code and artifacts are available at

Result: 定量实验表明，该方法在多种模型和数据集上比基线方法更频繁地穿越高密度区域。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需训练、理论上合理的插值方案，能够在数据分布中找到高概率的过渡路径。

Abstract: Interpolation in generative models allows for controlled generation, model
inspection, and more. Unfortunately, most generative models lack a principal
notion of interpolants without restrictive assumptions on either the model or
data dimension. In this paper, we develop a general interpolation scheme that
targets likely transition paths compatible with different metrics and
probability distributions. We consider interpolants analogous to a geodesic
constrained to a suitable data distribution and derive a novel algorithm for
computing these curves, which requires no additional training. Theoretically,
we show that our method locally can be considered as a geodesic under a
suitable Riemannian metric. We quantitatively show that our interpolation
scheme traverses higher density regions than baselines across a range of models
and datasets.

Motivation: 现有方法将扩散模型视为黑盒优化器，忽略了扩散生成过程中的内部分布转换，限制了效率。

Method: 在扩散生成过程中根据预期的聚合多目标值进行加权重采样，确保生成的样本符合期望的多目标玻尔兹曼分布。

Result: 在分子生成任务中，IMG仅需单次生成即可达到比需要数百次扩散生成的基线算法显著更高的超体积。

Conclusion: IMG算法可被视为优化的扩散过程，能够集成到现有方法中进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been successful in learning complex data distributions.
This capability has driven their application to high-dimensional
multi-objective black-box optimization problem. Existing approaches often
employ an external optimization loop, such as an evolutionary algorithm, to the
diffusion model. However, these approaches treat the diffusion model as a
black-box refiner, which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the
diffusion generation process, limiting their efficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG)
algorithm, which optimizes the diffusion process at inference-time to generate
samples that simultaneously satisfy multiple objectives. Specifically, our IMG
performs weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according
to the expected aggregated multi-objective values. This weighted resampling
strategy ensures the diffusion-generated samples are distributed according to
our desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution. We further derive that the
multi-target Boltzmann distribution has an interesting log-likelihood
interpretation, where it is the optimal solution to the distributional
multi-objective optimization problem. We implemented IMG for a multi-objective
molecule generation task. Experiments show that IMG, requiring only a single
generation pass, achieves a significantly higher hypervolume than baseline
optimization algorithms that often require hundreds of diffusion generations.
Notably, our algorithm can be viewed as an optimized diffusion process and can
be integrated into existing methods to further improve their performance.

Abstract: Multi-task learning in contextual bandits has attracted significant research
interest due to its potential to enhance decision-making across multiple
related tasks by leveraging shared structures and task-specific heterogeneity.
In this article, we propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework for
learning in various bandit instances. This framework captures both the
heterogeneity and the correlations among different bandit instances through a
hierarchical Bayesian model, enabling effective information sharing while
accommodating instance-specific variations. Unlike previous methods that
overlook the learning of the covariance structure across bandits, we introduce
an empirical Bayesian approach to estimate the covariance matrix of the prior
distribution.This enhances both the practicality and flexibility of learning
across multi-bandits. Building on this approach, we develop two efficient
algorithms: ebmTS (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Thompson Sampling) and
ebmUCB (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Upper Confidence Bound), both of which
incorporate the estimated prior into the decision-making process. We provide
the frequentist regret upper bounds for the proposed algorithms, thereby
filling a research gap in the field of multi-bandit problems. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior
performance of our algorithms, particularly in complex environments. Our
methods achieve lower cumulative regret compared to existing techniques,
highlighting their effectiveness in balancing exploration and exploitation
across multi-bandits.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了离线聚类偏好学习问题，提出了两种算法来处理多用户偏好学习中的相似性识别和数据不平衡挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的偏好学习涉及具有不同偏好的用户，面临两个核心挑战：(1)识别用户间相似性以有效聚合数据，特别是在离线数据在维度上不平衡的情况下；(2)处理不平衡的离线数据，其中某些偏好维度代表性不足。

Method: 首先提出Off-C²PL算法用于纯离线设置，然后扩展到具有主动数据增强的设置，提出A²-Off-C²PL算法，主动选择针对测试用户最不具信息性偏好维度的样本。

Result: 理论分析提供了明确捕捉样本噪声和偏差之间权衡的次优性界限，证明主动收集的样本比离线样本更有效。通过合成和真实世界数据集的模拟验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 提出的离线聚类偏好学习框架能够有效处理多用户偏好学习中的相似性识别和数据不平衡问题，主动数据增强策略进一步提升了学习效果。

Abstract: Preference learning from pairwise feedback is a widely adopted framework in
applications such as reinforcement learning with human feedback and
recommendations. In many practical settings, however, user interactions are
limited or costly, making offline preference learning necessary. Moreover,
real-world preference learning often involves users with different preferences.
For example, annotators from different backgrounds may rank the same responses
differently. This setting presents two central challenges: (1) identifying
similarity across users to effectively aggregate data, especially under
scenarios where offline data is imbalanced across dimensions, and (2) handling
the imbalanced offline data where some preference dimensions are
underrepresented. To address these challenges, we study the Offline Clustering
of Preference Learning problem, where the learner has access to fixed datasets
from multiple users with potentially different preferences and aims to maximize
utility for a test user. To tackle the first challenge, we first propose
Off-C$^2$PL for the pure offline setting, where the learner relies solely on
offline data. Our theoretical analysis provides a suboptimality bound that
explicitly captures the tradeoff between sample noise and bias. To address the
second challenge of inbalanced data, we extend our framework to the setting
with active-data augmentation where the learner is allowed to select a limited
number of additional active-data for the test user based on the cluster
structure learned by Off-C$^2$PL. In this setting, our second algorithm,
A$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL, actively selects samples that target the least-informative
dimensions of the test user's preference. We prove that these actively
collected samples contribute more effectively than offline ones. Finally, we
validate our theoretical results through simulations on synthetic and
real-world datasets.

*Ziliang Chen,Tianang Xiao,Jusheng Zhang,Yongsen Zheng,Xipeng Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于token感知的因果表示学习框架，通过语言token的结构因果模型解释了CLIP在组合推理上的脆弱性，揭示了组合不可识别性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP虽然在跨模态对齐方面表现良好，但在对象、属性和关系的组合推理上持续失败，现有因果解释通常将文本建模为单一向量，无法解释token级结构和硬负例失败等现象。

Method: 提出了基于语言token序列结构因果模型的token感知因果表示学习框架，将块可识别性扩展到token化文本，证明CLIP的对比目标可以在句子级和token级SCM下恢复模态不变潜在变量。

Result: 发现存在伪最优文本编码器，尽管实现完美的模态不变对齐，但对原子概念的SWAP、REPLACE和ADD操作不敏感，无法区分正确标题和硬负例。

Conclusion: 语言侧的非可识别性通过模态差距与视觉侧失败相关联，迭代组合操作增加了难度，需要改进负例挖掘策略。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) delivers strong cross modal
generalization by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space, yet it
persistently fails at compositional reasoning over objects, attributes, and
relations often behaving like a bag-of-words matcher. Prior causal accounts
typically model text as a single vector, obscuring token-level structure and
leaving core phenomena-such as prompt sensitivity and failures on hard
negatives unexplained. We address this gap with a token-aware causal
representation learning (CRL) framework grounded in a sequential,
language-token SCM. Our theory extends block identifiability to tokenized text,
proving that CLIP's contrastive objective can recover the modal-invariant
latent variable under both sentence-level and token-level SCMs. Crucially,
token granularity yields the first principled explanation of CLIP's
compositional brittleness: composition nonidentifiability. We show the
existence of pseudo-optimal text encoders that achieve perfect modal-invariant
alignment yet are provably insensitive to SWAP, REPLACE, and ADD operations
over atomic concepts, thereby failing to distinguish correct captions from hard
negatives despite optimizing the same training objective as true-optimal
encoders. The analysis further links language-side nonidentifiability to
visual-side failures via the modality gap and shows how iterated composition
operators compound hardness, motivating improved negative mining strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文分析了增量Adam优化器在线性可分数据上的隐式偏差，发现其与全批次Adam的ℓ∞-最大间隔偏差不同，增量Adam可能收敛到ℓ2-最大间隔分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adam是深度学习中最常用的优化器，但其理论理解有限。先前分析表明Adam偏向ℓ∞-几何解，但这些结果仅限于全批次情况。本研究旨在探索增量Adam在不同批次大小下的隐式偏差。

Method: 研究增量Adam在线性可分数据上的逻辑回归，构建结构化数据集证明其收敛行为，开发代理算法捕捉β2→1时的极限行为，并通过数据依赖的双重定点公式表征收敛方向。

Result: 增量Adam的隐式偏差与全批次Adam不同，在特定数据集上收敛到ℓ2-最大间隔分类器。Signum优化器在任何批次大小下都收敛到ℓ∞-最大间隔分类器。

Conclusion: Adam的隐式偏差关键取决于批次方案和数据集，而Signum保持不变性。批次大小对优化器的收敛行为有重要影响。

Abstract: Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2015] is the de facto optimizer in deep learning, yet
its theoretical understanding remains limited. Prior analyses show that Adam
favors solutions aligned with $\ell_\infty$-geometry, but these results are
restricted to the full-batch regime. In this work, we study the implicit bias
of incremental Adam (using one sample per step) for logistic regression on
linearly separable data, and we show that its bias can deviate from the
full-batch behavior. To illustrate this, we construct a class of structured
datasets where incremental Adam provably converges to the $\ell_2$-max-margin
classifier, in contrast to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin bias of full-batch
Adam. For general datasets, we develop a proxy algorithm that captures the
limiting behavior of incremental Adam as $\beta_2 \to 1$ and we characterize
its convergence direction via a data-dependent dual fixed-point formulation.
Finally, we prove that, unlike Adam, Signum [Bernstein et al., 2018] converges
to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin classifier for any batch size by taking $\beta$
close enough to 1. Overall, our results highlight that the implicit bias of
Adam crucially depends on both the batching scheme and the dataset, while
Signum remains invariant.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在隐私和安全约束下，存储和重放数据不可行，需要无需数据的持续学习方法来更新预训练模型。

Method: 使用分层模型反演(PMI)提高计算效率，通过高斯分布和对比模型建模类特征，确保合成特征与真实特征对齐。

Result: 该方法在多个持续学习设置中表现出色，能够有效学习新类别并保持与先前知识的兼容性。

Conclusion: 结合PMI和特征建模的方法为无需数据的持续学习提供了有效的解决方案，特别适用于大型预训练模型。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to incrementally train a model on a sequence of
tasks while retaining performance on prior ones. However, storing and replaying
data is often infeasible due to privacy or security constraints and impractical
for arbitrary pre-trained models. Data-free CL seeks to update models without
access to previous data. Beyond regularization, we employ model inversion to
synthesize data from the trained model, enabling replay without storing
samples. Yet, model inversion in predictive models faces two challenges: (1)
generating inputs solely from compressed output labels causes drift between
synthetic and real data, and replaying such data can erode prior knowledge; (2)
inversion is computationally expensive since each step backpropagates through
the full model. These issues are amplified in large pre-trained models such as
CLIP. To improve efficiency, we propose Per-layer Model Inversion (PMI),
inspired by faster convergence in single-layer optimization. PMI provides
strong initialization for full-model inversion, substantially reducing
iterations. To mitigate feature shift, we model class-wise features via
Gaussian distributions and contrastive model, ensuring alignment between
synthetic and real features. Combining PMI and feature modeling, our approach
enables continual learning of new classes by generating pseudo-images from
semantic-aware projected features, achieving strong effectiveness and
compatibility across multiple CL settings.

TL;DR: 量子退火用于SVM训练的研究表明，即使使用低精度QUBO编码（如每个参数1位），也能获得与经典LIBSVM相当的分类性能，有时甚至更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究量子退火在支持向量机训练中的应用，特别关注量子比特数量（与对偶权重离散化水平相关）对预测性能的影响。

Method: 将SVM训练建模为QUBO问题，使用量子退火进行模型优化，比较不同离散化水平（比特深度）下的性能，并与经典LIBSVM求解器进行对比。

Result: 低精度QUBO编码（如1位/参数）能产生有竞争力甚至更优的准确率；增加比特深度允许更大的正则化参数但不总能改善分类；选择正确的支持向量可能比精确权重更重要。

Conclusion: 虽然当前硬件限制了可求解QUBO问题的规模，但研究结果突显了量子退火在SVM训练中的潜力，随着量子设备的发展，这种方法的效率将进一步提升。

Abstract: Training Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can be formulated as a QUBO problem,
enabling the use of quantum annealing for model optimization. In this work, we
study how the number of qubits - linked to the discretization level of dual
weights - affects predictive performance across datasets. We compare QUBO-based
SVM training to the classical LIBSVM solver and find that even low-precision
QUBO encodings (e.g., 1 bit per parameter) yield competitive, and sometimes
superior, accuracy. While increased bit-depth enables larger regularization
parameters, it does not always improve classification. Our findings suggest
that selecting the right support vectors may matter more than their precise
weighting. Although current hardware limits the size of solvable QUBOs, our
results highlight the potential of quantum annealing for efficient SVM training
as quantum devices scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后验采样在图像修复、去模糊和MRI重建等任务中具有重要应用，但近似后验采样在计算上通常是难解的。现有方法如Langevin动力学对分数估计误差敏感，需要更强的误差约束。

Method: 结合扩散模型与退火Langevin动力学，在log-concave分布假设下进行条件采样。该方法仅需对分数误差施加L^4界约束，相比传统方法放宽了要求。

Result: 证明了该方法能够在多项式时间内实现条件采样，且仅需L^4界约束分数误差，显著优于需要MGF界（亚指数误差）的传统Langevin动力学方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为后验采样提供了一个计算可行的解决方案，在保持理论保证的同时放宽了对分数估计精度的要求，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Given a noisy linear measurement $y = Ax + \xi$ of a distribution $p(x)$, and
a good approximation to the prior $p(x)$, when can we sample from the posterior
$p(x \mid y)$? Posterior sampling provides an accurate and fair framework for
tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and MRI reconstruction, and several
heuristics attempt to approximate it. Unfortunately, approximate posterior
sampling is computationally intractable in general.
  To sidestep this hardness, we focus on (local or global) log-concave
distributions $p(x)$. In this regime, Langevin dynamics yields posterior
samples when the exact scores of $p(x)$ are available, but it is brittle to
score--estimation error, requiring an MGF bound (sub-exponential error). By
contrast, in the unconditional setting, diffusion models succeed with only an
$L^2$ bound on the score error. We prove that combining diffusion models with
an annealed variant of Langevin dynamics achieves conditional sampling in
polynomial time using merely an $L^4$ bound on the score error.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究前沿LLM在持续学习能力方面的安全漏洞，特别是Agent Skills框架虽然有用但存在根本性安全缺陷，需要揭示其脆弱性。

Method: 通过在长Agent Skill文件和引用脚本中隐藏恶意指令，演示如何窃取敏感数据，并展示如何绕过流行编码代理的系统级防护措施。

Result: 成功证明了Agent Skills框架极易受到提示注入攻击，能够泄露内部文件、密码等敏感信息，且防护措施可被绕过。

Conclusion: 尽管研究不断推进和模型能力扩展，前沿LLM在现实场景中仍然容易受到简单提示注入攻击，安全防护存在严重不足。

Abstract: Enabling continual learning in LLMs remains a key unresolved research
challenge. In a recent announcement, a frontier LLM company made a step towards
this by introducing Agent Skills, a framework that equips agents with new
knowledge based on instructions stored in simple markdown files. Although Agent
Skills can be a very useful tool, we show that they are fundamentally insecure,
since they enable trivially simple prompt injections. We demonstrate how to
hide malicious instructions in long Agent Skill files and referenced scripts to
exfiltrate sensitive data, such as internal files or passwords. Importantly, we
show how to bypass system-level guardrails of a popular coding agent: a benign,
task-specific approval with the "Don't ask again" option can carry over to
closely related but harmful actions. Overall, we conclude that despite ongoing
research efforts and scaling model capabilities, frontier LLMs remain
vulnerable to very simple prompt injections in realistic scenarios. Our code is

Abstract: Incorporating causal knowledge and mechanisms is essential for refining
causal models and improving downstream tasks such as designing new treatments.
In this paper, we introduce a novel concept in causal discovery, termed
interventional constraints, which differs fundamentally from interventional
data. While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables,
interventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of
inequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset
(Sachs et al.\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3
exerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow
enforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from
PIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as
learning that "PIP3 inhibits Akt". Interventional constraints bridge this gap
by explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs,
ensuring learned models respect known causal influences. To formalize
interventional constraints, we propose a metric to quantify total causal
effects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained
optimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method. We
evaluate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate that integrating
interventional constraints not only improves model accuracy and ensures
consistency with established findings, making models more explainable, but also
facilitates the discovery of new causal relationships that would otherwise be
costly to identify.

Conclusion: 强化学习方法可以有效适应随机、非平稳和奖励稀疏的环境，为复杂环境中的RL应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed to optimize
problem-solving by learning actions that maximize rewards, a task that becomes
particularly challenging in random and nonstationary environments. Even
advanced RL algorithms are often limited in their ability to solve problems in
these conditions. In applications such as searching for underwater pollution
clouds with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), RL algorithms must navigate
reward-sparse environments, where actions frequently result in a zero reward.
This paper aims to address these challenges by revisiting and modifying
classical RL approaches to efficiently operate in sparse, randomized, and
nonstationary environments. We systematically study a large number of
modifications, including hierarchical algorithm changes, multigoal learning,
and the integration of a location memory as an external output filter to
prevent state revisits. Our results demonstrate that a modified Monte
Carlo-based approach significantly outperforms traditional Q-learning and two
exhaustive search patterns, illustrating its potential in adapting RL to
complex environments. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning
approaches can be effectively adapted for use in random, nonstationary, and
reward-sparse environments.

TL;DR: 提出了UnifiedFL框架，通过图神经网络统一表示异构神经网络架构，解决联邦学习中架构异构、数据分布差异和测试域不同的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习方法仅支持单一模型家族的变体，无法处理CNN、GNN、MLP等根本不同的网络类型，且忽视了测试域与训练域不同的领域断裂问题。

Method: 使用共享GNN将异构本地网络表示为有向模型图中的节点和边，通过欧氏距离进行客户端聚类，采用两层聚合策略平衡收敛性和多样性。

Result: 在MedMNIST分类和海马体分割基准测试中，UnifiedFL表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: UnifiedFL能有效解决联邦学习中的架构异构、数据分布差异和测试域不同等挑战。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for collaborative model
training across multiple clients without sharing raw data, enabling
privacy-preserving applications in areas such as radiology and pathology.
However, works on collaborative training across clients with fundamentally
different neural architectures and non-identically distributed datasets remain
scarce. Existing FL frameworks face several limitations. Despite claiming to
support architectural heterogeneity, most recent FL methods only tolerate
variants within a single model family (e.g., shallower, deeper, or wider CNNs),
still presuming a shared global architecture and failing to accommodate
federations where clients deploy fundamentally different network types (e.g.,
CNNs, GNNs, MLPs). Moreover, existing approaches often address only statistical
heterogeneity while overlooking the domain-fracture problem, where each
client's data distribution differs markedly from that faced at testing time,
undermining model generalizability. When clients use different architectures,
have non-identically distributed data, and encounter distinct test domains,
current methods perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose
UnifiedFL, a dynamic federated learning framework that represents heterogeneous
local networks as nodes and edges in a directed model graph optimized by a
shared graph neural network (GNN). UnifiedFL introduces (i) a common GNN to
parameterize all architectures, (ii) distance-driven clustering via Euclidean
distances between clients' parameters, and (iii) a two-tier aggregation policy
balancing convergence and diversity. Experiments on MedMNIST classification and
hippocampus segmentation benchmarks demonstrate UnifiedFL's superior
performance. Code and data: https://github.com/basiralab/UnifiedFL

Abstract: Financial forecasting increasingly uses large neural network models, but
their opacity raises challenges for trust and regulatory compliance. We present
several approaches to explainable and reliable AI in finance. \emph{First}, we
describe how Time-LLM, a time series foundation model, uses a prompt to avoid a
wrong directional forecast. \emph{Second}, we show that combining foundation
models for time series forecasting with a reliability estimator can filter our
unreliable predictions. \emph{Third}, we argue for symbolic reasoning encoding
domain rules for transparent justification. These approaches shift emphasize
executing only forecasts that are both reliable and explainable. Experiments on
equity and cryptocurrency data show that the architecture reduces false
positives and supports selective execution. By integrating predictive
performance with reliability estimation and rule-based reasoning, our framework
advances transparent and auditable financial AI systems.

Conclusion: CorVS方法能够有效解决真实工业环境中的人员识别问题，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Worker location data is key to higher productivity in industrial sites.
Cameras are a promising tool for localization in logistics warehouses since
they also offer valuable environmental contexts such as package status.
However, identifying individuals with only visual data is often impractical.
Accordingly, several prior studies identified people in videos by comparing
their trajectories and wearable sensor measurements. While this approach has
advantages such as independence from appearance, the existing methods may break
down under real-world conditions. To overcome this challenge, we propose CorVS,
a novel data-driven person identification method based on correspondence
between visual tracking trajectories and sensor measurements. Firstly, our deep
learning model predicts correspondence probabilities and reliabilities for
every pair of a trajectory and sensor measurements. Secondly, our algorithm
matches the trajectories and sensor measurements over time using the predicted
probabilities and reliabilities. We developed a dataset with actual warehouse
operations and demonstrated the method's effectiveness for real-world
applications.

TL;DR: 开发了基于Flow Matching的生成式AI模型FM-Cast，用于高效、精准地预测平流层突然增温事件的时空演变，性能媲美或超越主流数值天气预报系统，计算效率显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平流层突然增温是次季节可预报性的关键来源和极端冬季天气的主要驱动因素，但传统数值天气预报系统在物理表示、初始化和计算需求方面存在局限，数据驱动方法在复杂三维动力学和概率预报方面的应用仍待探索。

Method: 采用基于Flow Matching的生成式AI模型FM-Cast，构建了针对平流层环流时空演变的概率预报系统，能够生成50个成员的30天预报。

Result: 在1998-2024年18个主要SSW事件评估中，FM-Cast能够提前20天准确预测10个事件的发生、强度和形态，集合准确率超过50%，性能与领先NWP系统相当或更优，且在消费级GPU上仅需2分钟完成预报。

Conclusion: FM-Cast建立了计算高效的平流层异常概率预报范式，展示了生成式AI在深化大气-气候动力学物理理解方面的潜力，并通过理想化实验揭示了SSW可预报性与物理驱动因素的根本联系。

Abstract: Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs) are key sources of subseasonal
predictability and major drivers of extreme winter weather. Yet, their accurate
and efficient forecast remains a persistent challenge for numerical weather
prediction (NWP) systems due to limitations in physical representation,
initialization, and the immense computational demands of ensemble forecasts.
While data-driven forecasting is rapidly evolving, its application to the
complex, three-dimensional dynamics of SSWs, particularly for probabilistic
forecast, remains underexplored. Here, we bridge this gap by developing a Flow
Matching-based generative AI model (FM-Cast) for efficient and skillful
probabilistic forecasting of the spatiotemporal evolution of stratospheric
circulation. Evaluated across 18 major SSW events (1998-2024), FM-Cast
skillfully forecasts the onset, intensity, and morphology of 10 events up to 20
days in advance, achieving ensemble accuracies above 50%. Its performance is
comparable to or exceeds leading NWP systems while requiring only two minutes
for a 50-member, 30-day forecast on a consumer GPU. Furthermore, leveraging
FM-Cast as a scientific tool, we demonstrate through idealized experiments that
SSW predictability is fundamentally linked to its underlying physical drivers,
distinguishing between events forced from the troposphere and those driven by
internal stratospheric dynamics. Our work thus establishes a computationally
efficient paradigm for probabilistic forecasting stratospheric anomalies and
showcases generative AI's potential to deepen the physical understanding of
atmosphere-climate dynamics.

Result: 在PettingZoo、MiniGrid、GRF和SMACv2等长期依赖任务上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应上下文长度优化框架能有效提升MARL在复杂环境中的探索效率和收敛性能。

Abstract: Recently, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has demonstrated
promising performance for solving challenging tasks, such as long-term
dependencies and non-Markovian environments. Its success is partly attributed
to conditioning policies on large fixed context length. However, such large
fixed context lengths may lead to limited exploration efficiency and redundant
information. In this paper, we propose a novel MARL framework to obtain
adaptive and effective contextual information. Specifically, we design a
central agent that dynamically optimizes context length via temporal gradient
analysis, enhancing exploration to facilitate convergence to global optima in
MARL. Furthermore, to enhance the adaptive optimization capability of the
context length, we present an efficient input representation for the central
agent, which effectively filters redundant information. By leveraging a
Fourier-based low-frequency truncation method, we extract global temporal
trends across decentralized agents, providing an effective and efficient
representation of the MARL environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on long-term
dependency tasks, including PettingZoo, MiniGrid, Google Research Football
(GRF), and StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge v2 (SMACv2).

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) enables simultaneous training across related tasks,
leveraging shared information to improve generalization, efficiency, and
robustness, especially in data-scarce or high-dimensional scenarios. While deep

  This chapter surveys MTL approaches based on SVM and TWSVM, highlighting

  Finally, we identify research gaps and outline future directions for building

Conclusion: CoLA-World为领域建立了一个稳健高效的新范式，通过联合训练解锁了世界模型与潜在动作模型的协同进化潜力。

Abstract: Adapting pre-trained video generation models into controllable world models
via latent actions is a promising step towards creating generalist world
models. The dominant paradigm adopts a two-stage approach that trains latent
action model (LAM) and the world model separately, resulting in redundant
training and limiting their potential for co-adaptation. A conceptually simple
and appealing idea is to directly replace the forward dynamic model in LAM with
a powerful world model and training them jointly, but it is non-trivial and
prone to representational collapse. In this work, we propose CoLA-World, which
for the first time successfully realizes this synergistic paradigm, resolving
the core challenge in joint learning through a critical warm-up phase that
effectively aligns the representations of the from-scratch LAM with the
pre-trained world model. This unlocks a co-evolution cycle: the world model
acts as a knowledgeable tutor, providing gradients to shape a high-quality LAM,
while the LAM offers a more precise and adaptable control interface to the
world model. Empirically, CoLA-World matches or outperforms prior two-stage
methods in both video simulation quality and downstream visual planning,
establishing a robust and efficient new paradigm for the field.

Abstract: Personalized treatment outcome prediction based on trial data for
small-sample and rare patient groups is critical in precision medicine.
However, the costly trial data limit the prediction performance. To address
this issue, we propose a cross-fidelity knowledge distillation and adaptive
fusion network (CFKD-AFN), which leverages abundant but low-fidelity simulation
data to enhance predictions on scarce but high-fidelity trial data. CFKD-AFN
incorporates a dual-channel knowledge distillation module to extract
complementary knowledge from the low-fidelity model, along with an
attention-guided fusion module to dynamically integrate multi-source
information. Experiments on treatment outcome prediction for the chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease demonstrates significant improvements of CFKD-AFN
over state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy, ranging from 6.67\% to
74.55\%, and strong robustness to varying high-fidelity dataset sizes.
Furthermore, we extend CFKD-AFN to an interpretable variant, enabling the
exploration of latent medical semantics to support clinical decision-making.

Conclusion: 通过流形约束方法，MRGC能够保持图压缩的分类复杂度降低能力，并在通用对抗攻击下确保鲁棒性能。

Abstract: Graph condensation (GC) has gained significant attention for its ability to
synthesize smaller yet informative graphs. However, existing studies often
overlook the robustness of GC in scenarios where the original graph is
corrupted. In such cases, we observe that the performance of GC deteriorates
significantly, while existing robust graph learning technologies offer only
limited effectiveness. Through both empirical investigation and theoretical
analysis, we reveal that GC is inherently an intrinsic-dimension-reducing
process, synthesizing a condensed graph with lower classification complexity.
Although this property is critical for effective GC performance, it remains
highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. To tackle this vulnerability
and improve GC robustness, we adopt the geometry perspective of graph data
manifold and propose a novel Manifold-constrained Robust Graph Condensation
framework named MRGC. Specifically, we introduce three graph data manifold
learning modules that guide the condensed graph to lie within a smooth,
low-dimensional manifold with minimal class ambiguity, thereby preserving the
classification complexity reduction capability of GC and ensuring robust
performance under universal adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the robustness of \ModelName\ across diverse attack scenarios.

Conclusion: ReSpec为基于RL的高效LLM适配提供了实用解决方案，成功将推测解码技术适配到RL训练环境中。

Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL) is
often bottlenecked by the generation stage, which can consume over 75\% of the
training time. Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates autoregressive generation
in serving systems, but its behavior under RL training remains largely
unexplored. We identify three critical gaps that hinder the naive integration
of SD into RL systems: diminishing speedups at large batch sizes, drafter
staleness under continual actor updates, and drafter-induced policy
degradation.
  To address these gaps, we present ReSpec, a system that adapts SD to RL
through three complementary mechanisms: dynamically tuning SD configurations,
evolving the drafter via knowledge distillation, and weighting updates by
rollout rewards. On Qwen models (3B--14B), ReSpec achieves up to 4.5x speedup
while preserving reward convergence and training stability, providing a
practical solution for efficient RL-based LLM adaptation.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in time-series data is a critical challenge with
significant implications for network security. Recent quantum machine learning
approaches, such as quantum kernel methods and variational quantum circuits,
have shown promise in capturing complex data distributions for anomaly
detection but remain constrained by limited qubit counts. We introduce in this
work a novel Quantum Gated Recurrent Unit (QGRU)-based Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) employing Successive Data Injection (SuDaI) and a multi-metric
gating strategy for robust network anomaly detection. Our model uniquely
utilizes a quantum-enhanced generator that outputs parameters (mean and
log-variance) of a Gaussian distribution via reparameterization, combined with
a Wasserstein critic to stabilize adversarial training. Anomalies are
identified through a novel gating mechanism that initially flags potential
anomalies based on Gaussian uncertainty estimates and subsequently verifies
them using a composite of critic scores and reconstruction errors. Evaluated on
benchmark datasets, our method achieves a high time-series aware F1 score
(TaF1) of 89.43% demonstrating superior capability in detecting anomalies
accurately and promptly as compared to existing classical and quantum models.
Furthermore, the trained QGRU-WGAN was deployed on real IBM Quantum hardware,
where it retained high anomaly detection performance, confirming its robustness
and practical feasibility on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
devices.

Abstract: Data selection is a critical aspect of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). Current data selection methods are largely heuristic-based,
lacking theoretical guarantees and generalizability. This work proposes a
theoretically-grounded approach using influence functions to estimate the
contribution of each data point to the learning objective. To overcome the
prohibitive computational cost of policy rollouts required for online influence
estimation, we introduce an off-policy influence estimation method that
efficiently approximates data influence using pre-collected offline
trajectories. Furthermore, to manage the high-dimensional gradients of LLMs, we
employ sparse random projection to reduce dimensionality and improve storage
and computation efficiency. Leveraging these techniques, we develop
\textbf{C}urriculum \textbf{R}L with \textbf{O}ff-\textbf{P}olicy
\text{I}nfluence guidance (\textbf{CROPI}), a multi-stage RL framework that
iteratively selects the most influential data for the current policy.
Experiments on models up to 7B parameters demonstrate that CROPI significantly
accelerates training. On a 1.5B model, it achieves a 2.66x step-level
acceleration while using only 10\% of the data per stage compared to
full-dataset training. Our results highlight the substantial potential of
influence-based data selection for efficient RLVR.

Motivation: 可穿戴设备的心电图监测面临分布外数据的挑战，如未见病理或噪声信号，会导致标准分类器产生高置信度的错误预测，危及患者安全。现有方法要么忽略计算约束，要么分别处理噪声和未见类别。

Method: 基准测试六种无监督异常检测方法（Deep SVDD、重构模型、掩码异常检测、归一化流、扩散模型），通过神经架构搜索在严格资源约束下（最多512k参数）进行优化，评估在PTB-XL和BUT QDB数据集上检测分布外心血管疾病类别和噪声信号的能力。

Result: Deep SVDD始终在检测性能和效率之间达到最佳平衡。在实际部署模拟中，将优化的Deep SVDD过滤器与诊断分类器集成，相比仅使用分类器的基线，准确率提高了21个百分点。

Conclusion: 优化的无监督异常检测过滤器可以保护自动心电图分析，使可穿戴设备上的连续心血管监测更安全可靠。

Abstract: Continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring via wearables offers
significant potential for early cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection.
However, deploying deep learning models for automated analysis in
resource-constrained environments faces reliability challenges due to
inevitable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. OOD inputs, such as unseen
pathologies or noisecorrupted signals, often cause erroneous, high-confidence
predictions by standard classifiers, compromising patient safety. Existing OOD
detection methods either neglect computational constraints or address noise and
unseen classes separately. This paper explores Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
(UAD) as an independent, upstream filtering mechanism to improve robustness. We
benchmark six UAD approaches, including Deep SVDD, reconstruction-based models,
Masked Anomaly Detection, normalizing flows, and diffusion models, optimized
via Neural Architecture Search (NAS) under strict resource constraints (at most
512k parameters). Evaluation on PTB-XL and BUT QDB datasets assessed detection
of OOD CVD classes and signals unsuitable for analysis due to noise. Results
show Deep SVDD consistently achieves the best trade-off between detection and
efficiency. In a realistic deployment simulation, integrating the optimized
Deep SVDD filter with a diagnostic classifier improved accuracy by up to 21
percentage points over a classifier-only baseline. This study demonstrates that
optimized UAD filters can safeguard automated ECG analysis, enabling safer,
more reliable continuous cardiovascular monitoring on wearables.

TL;DR: 研究大型语言模型能否作为上下文元学习器进行模型和超参数选择，通过将数据集转换为可解释元数据，让LLM推荐模型族和超参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型和超参数选择在机器学习中至关重要但具有挑战性，通常需要专家直觉或昂贵的自动搜索，希望探索LLM能否作为轻量级通用助手来解决这个问题。

Method: 将数据集转换为可解释元数据，采用两种提示策略：零样本模式（仅依赖预训练知识）和元信息模式（添加过去任务中模型性能示例）。

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试中，LLM能够利用数据集元数据推荐有竞争力的模型和超参数而无需搜索，元信息提示的改进证明了其上下文元学习能力。

Conclusion: LLM作为轻量级通用助手在模型选择和超参数优化方面展现出有前景的新角色，能够有效利用数据集元数据进行推荐。

Abstract: Model and hyperparameter selection are critical but challenging in machine
learning, typically requiring expert intuition or expensive automated search.
We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can act as in-context
meta-learners for this task. By converting each dataset into interpretable
metadata, we prompt an LLM to recommend both model families and
hyperparameters. We study two prompting strategies: (1) a zero-shot mode
relying solely on pretrained knowledge, and (2) a meta-informed mode augmented
with examples of models and their performance on past tasks. Across synthetic
and real-world benchmarks, we show that LLMs can exploit dataset metadata to
recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search, and that
improvements from meta-informed prompting demonstrate their capacity for
in-context meta-learning. These results highlight a promising new role for LLMs
as lightweight, general-purpose assistants for model selection and
hyperparameter optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法如GRPO由于依赖当前策略分布而探索受限，轨迹多样性不足。依赖专家模型的方法计算成本高且不易获得。

Method: ICPO框架包含：混合策略GRPO与隐式专家引导、专家区域拒绝采样过滤不可靠轨迹、退火专家奖励塑形平衡专家指导与自主改进。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，ICPO持续提升强化学习性能和训练稳定性。

Conclusion: ICPO为LRMs提供了一个可扩展且有效的RLVR范式，无需依赖高级专家模型轨迹。

Abstract: Existing Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods, such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have achieved remarkable progress
in improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).
However, they exhibit limited exploration due to reliance on on-policy rollouts
where confined to the current policy's distribution, resulting in narrow
trajectory diversity. Recent approaches attempt to expand policy coverage by
incorporating trajectories generated from stronger expert models, yet this
reliance increases computational cost and such advaned models are often
inaccessible. To address these issues, we propose In-Context Steered Policy
Optimization (ICPO), a unified framework that leverages the inherent in-context
learning capability of LRMs to provide expert guidance using existing datasets.
ICPO introduces Mixed-Policy GRPO with Implicit Expert Forcing, which expands
exploration beyond the current policy distribution without requiring advanced
LRM trajectories. To further stabilize optimization, ICPO integrates Expert
Region Reject Sampling to filter unreliable off-policy trajectories and
Annealed Expert-Bonus Reward Shaping to balance early expert guidance with
later autonomous improvement. Results demonstrate that ICPO consistently
enhances reinforcement learning performance and training stability on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, revealing a scalable and effective RLVR
paradigm for LRMs.

*Zaishuo Xia,Yukuan Lu,Xinyi Li,Yifan Xu,Yubei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了几何正则化世界模型(GRWM)，通过在潜在表示空间中强制连续观测点保持几何邻近性，显著改善了世界模型的长期预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前世界模型在长期预测中表现脆弱，主要原因是表示质量不足——高维外部感知输入和损失/纠缠的潜在表示使动态学习变得困难。

Method: GRWM在潜在表示空间中施加几何正则化，确保自然感官轨迹上的连续点在潜在空间中保持邻近，从而学习与真实环境拓扑对齐的表示。

Result: 在确定性3D环境和长期预测任务中，GRWM显著提高了rollout保真度和稳定性，学习到了具有优越几何结构的潜在流形。

Conclusion: 改进表示学习是构建鲁棒世界模型的直接有效途径，能够在不扩大动态模块的情况下实现可靠的长期预测。

Abstract: A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves.
Given past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the
embodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for
enabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic
settings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and
degrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation
quality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or
entangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask
whether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve
world-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly
accurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing
a model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We
propose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that
consecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent
representation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent
representations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.
GRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales
with trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative
backbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,
GRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that
its benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric
structure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation
learning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering
reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文挑战了将Transformer参数记忆视为简单关联查找的传统观点，提出了几何视角，认为模型会自发形成全局实体关系的几何结构，即使在没有明确优化压力的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上，序列建模中的参数记忆被抽象为实体共现的暴力查找。作者质疑这种关联视角，希望探索记忆是否以几何形式存储，特别是当模型需要处理训练数据中未共现的实体关系时。

Method: 通过分析Transformer推理的清晰实例，并与Node2Vec建立联系，研究几何结构如何从谱偏置中自然产生。作者分离出与局部共现存储不兼容的推理案例。

Result: 研究发现Transformer确实会自发合成原子事实的几何结构，编码所有实体间的全局关系，包括未共现的实体。这种几何结构将复杂的ℓ重组合推理任务简化为易学习的1步几何任务。

Conclusion: 几何视角的参数记忆应该引导研究人员重新思考知识获取、容量、发现和遗忘等领域的默认直觉。分析还指出了使Transformer记忆更几何化的改进空间。

Abstract: In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been
predominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between
entities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how
memory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of
Transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of
the local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must
have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global
relationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in
turn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\ell$-fold composition
into an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.
  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding
geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,
despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly
attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.
Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more
succinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.
  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry
stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed
arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also
points to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more
strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages
revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like
knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.

Motivation: 推理延迟是LLM大规模部署的关键瓶颈，现有推测解码方法通常依赖二元化的草稿-验证框架且缺乏严格的理论基础。

Method: 引入多基础推测解码框架，通过理论分析多模型token生成的相互作用，优化模型能力、接受长度和计算成本之间的关系。

Result: 在多个模型家族上的实验结果显示：LLaMA2-Chat 7B加速3.31-4.01倍，LLaMA3-8B加速3.87倍，Vicuna-7B加速4.43倍，Qwen2-7B加速3.85倍。

Conclusion: 多基础推测解码框架不仅提供理论支撑，还能与现有技术集成，在保持输出分布的同时显著加速推理过程。

Abstract: Inference latency stands as a critical bottleneck in the large-scale
deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Speculative decoding methods have
recently shown promise in accelerating inference without compromising the
output distribution. However, existing work typically relies on a dualistic
draft-verify framework and lacks rigorous theoretical grounding. In this paper,
we introduce a novel \emph{polybasic} speculative decoding framework,
underpinned by a comprehensive theoretical analysis. Specifically, we prove a
fundamental theorem that characterizes the optimal inference time for
multi-model speculative decoding systems, shedding light on how to extend
beyond the dualistic approach to a more general polybasic paradigm. Through our
theoretical investigation of multi-model token generation, we expose and
optimize the interplay between model capabilities, acceptance lengths, and
overall computational cost. Our framework supports both standalone
implementation and integration with existing speculative techniques, leading to
accelerated performance in practice. Experimental results across multiple model
families demonstrate that our approach yields speedup ratios ranging from
$3.31\times$ to $4.01\times$ for LLaMA2-Chat 7B, up to $3.87 \times$ for
LLaMA3-8B, up to $4.43 \times$ for Vicuna-7B and up to $3.85 \times$ for
Qwen2-7B -- all while preserving the original output distribution. We release
our theoretical proofs and implementation code to facilitate further
investigation into polybasic speculative decoding.

Motivation: 扩展HOHL的理论基础，证明其在更广泛学习场景下的有效性和鲁棒性，特别是在非几何结构数据和主动学习环境中。

Method: 采用截断版本的HOHL方法，通过多尺度拉普拉斯算子的幂来强制执行高阶平滑性，并在完全监督学习框架下作为正则化器使用。

Result: 证明了截断HOHL的一致性，推导了显式收敛率，在主动学习和非几何结构数据集中表现出强大的实证性能。

Conclusion: HOHL在不同学习设置中展现出多功能性和鲁棒性，为超图学习提供了坚实的理论基础和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL) was recently introduced as a
principled alternative to classical hypergraph regularization, enforcing
higher-order smoothness via powers of multiscale Laplacians induced by the
hypergraph structure. Prior work established the well- and ill-posedness of
HOHL through an asymptotic consistency analysis in geometric settings. We
extend this theoretical foundation by proving the consistency of a truncated
version of HOHL and deriving explicit convergence rates when HOHL is used as a
regularizer in fully supervised learning. We further demonstrate its strong
empirical performance in active learning and in datasets lacking an underlying
geometric structure, highlighting HOHL's versatility and robustness across
diverse learning settings.

TL;DR: 研究发现BF16浮点精度在RL微调LLM时会导致训练和推理策略不一致，而改用FP16能有效解决此问题，带来更稳定的优化和更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RL微调LLM时因浮点精度导致的训练和推理策略不匹配问题，这种不稳定性限制了模型性能。

Method: 简单地将浮点精度从BF16改为FP16，无需修改模型架构或学习算法，仅需几行代码变更。

Result: 使用FP16能实现更稳定的优化、更快的收敛速度，并在多种任务、算法和框架中表现出更强的性能。

Conclusion: FP16比BF16更适合RL微调LLM，建议重新考虑精度权衡问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often
suffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and
inference policies. While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue
through algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that its
root cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adopted
BF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors that
breaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, we
demonstrate that simply reverting to \textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates this
mismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only
a few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model
architecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16
uniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger
performance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks. We hope these
findings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision trade-offs in RL
fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种三阶段贝叶斯域对抗神经网络(staged B-DANN)，结合参数迁移和共享潜在空间适应，在数据稀缺的目标域中提高预测精度和泛化能力，并提供不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习需要大量高质量数据，但实验数据往往稀疏、有噪声或不充分。参数迁移在域差异大时性能下降，域对抗神经网络(DANNs)能处理大域偏移但不稳定且缺乏不确定性量化。

Method: 三阶段框架：1)在源域训练确定性特征提取器；2)使用DANN对抗性精炼特征提取器；3)在适应后的特征提取器上构建贝叶斯神经网络，在目标域微调以处理条件偏移和产生校准的不确定性估计。

Result: 在合成基准测试中显著优于标准迁移技术，在矩形通道临界热通量预测任务中提高了预测精度和泛化能力。

Conclusion: staged B-DANN方法能改善预测精度和泛化，可能有助于核工程等其他领域。

Abstract: The use of ML in engineering has grown steadily to support a wide array of
applications. Among these methods, deep neural networks have been widely
adopted due to their performance and accessibility, but they require large,
high-quality datasets. Experimental data are often sparse, noisy, or
insufficient to build resilient data-driven models. Transfer learning, which
leverages relevant data-abundant source domains to assist learning in
data-scarce target domains, has shown efficacy. Parameter transfer, where
pretrained weights are reused, is common but degrades under large domain
shifts. Domain-adversarial neural networks (DANNs) help address this issue by
learning domain-invariant representations, thereby improving transfer under
greater domain shifts in a semi-supervised setting. However, DANNs can be
unstable during training and lack a native means for uncertainty
quantification. This study introduces a fully-supervised three-stage framework,
the staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN), that
combines parameter transfer and shared latent space adaptation. In Stage 1, a
deterministic feature extractor is trained on the source domain. This feature
extractor is then adversarially refined using a DANN in Stage 2. In Stage 3, a
Bayesian neural network is built on the adapted feature extractor for
fine-tuning on the target domain to handle conditional shifts and yield
calibrated uncertainty estimates. This staged B-DANN approach was first
validated on a synthetic benchmark, where it was shown to significantly
outperform standard transfer techniques. It was then applied to the task of
predicting critical heat flux in rectangular channels, leveraging data from
tube experiments as the source domain. The results of this study show that the
staged B-DANN method can improve predictive accuracy and generalization,
potentially assisting other domains in nuclear engineering.

Abstract: Deploying machine learning models on compute-constrained devices has become a
key building block of modern IoT applications. In this work, we present a
compression scheme for boosted decision trees, addressing the growing need for
lightweight machine learning models. Specifically, we provide techniques for
training compact boosted decision tree ensembles that exhibit a reduced memory
footprint by rewarding, among other things, the reuse of features and
thresholds during training. Our experimental evaluation shows that models
achieved the same performance with a compression ratio of 4-16x compared to
LightGBM models using an adapted training process and an alternative memory
layout. Once deployed, the corresponding IoT devices can operate independently
of constant communication or external energy supply, and, thus, autonomously,
requiring only minimal computing power and energy. This capability opens the
door to a wide range of IoT applications, including remote monitoring, edge
analytics, and real-time decision making in isolated or power-limited

Motivation: 捷径（在训练中表现良好但泛化失败的虚假规则）对深度网络可靠性构成重大挑战，但其对特征表示的影响研究不足，阻碍了设计原则性捷径缓解方法。

Method: 通过新颖的实验设计量化由捷径诱导偏斜导致的准确率退化的层级贡献，通过在干净和偏斜数据集上的反事实训练进行研究，在CIFAR-10、Waterbirds和CelebA数据集上使用VGG、ResNet、DeiT和ConvNeXt架构。

Conclusion: 层级捷径缓解策略的分析表明设计通用方法的困难，支持采用数据集和架构特定的方法。

Abstract: Shortcuts, spurious rules that perform well during training but fail to
generalize, present a major challenge to the reliability of deep networks
(Geirhos et al., 2020). However, the impact of shortcuts on feature
representations remains understudied, obstructing the design of principled
shortcut-mitigation methods. To overcome this limitation, we investigate the
layer-wise localization of shortcuts in deep models. Our novel experiment
design quantifies the layer-wise contribution to accuracy degradation caused by
a shortcut-inducing skew by counterfactual training on clean and skewed
datasets. We employ our design to study shortcuts on CIFAR-10, Waterbirds, and
CelebA datasets across VGG, ResNet, DeiT, and ConvNeXt architectures. We find
that shortcut learning is not localized in specific layers but distributed
throughout the network. Different network parts play different roles in this
process: shallow layers predominantly encode spurious features, while deeper
layers predominantly forget core features that are predictive on clean data. We
also analyze the differences in localization and describe its principal axes of
variation. Finally, our analysis of layer-wise shortcut-mitigation strategies
suggests the hardness of designing general methods, supporting dataset- and
architecture-specific approaches instead.

Conclusion: 局部校准方法能够有效解决多分类校准中的邻近性偏差问题，特别是在特征空间稀疏区域，为高风险应用提供了更可靠的校准保证。

Abstract: Developing trustworthy Machine Learning (ML) models requires their predicted
probabilities to be well-calibrated, meaning they should reflect true-class
frequencies. Among calibration notions in multiclass classification, strong
calibration is the most stringent, as it requires all predicted probabilities
to be simultaneously calibrated across all classes. However, existing
approaches to multiclass calibration lack a notion of distance among inputs,
which makes them vulnerable to proximity bias: predictions in sparse regions of
the feature space are systematically miscalibrated. This is especially relevant
in high-stakes settings, such as healthcare, where the sparse instances are
exactly those most at risk of biased treatment. In this work, we address this
main shortcoming by introducing a local perspective on multiclass calibration.
First, we formally define multiclass local calibration and establish its
relationship with strong calibration. Second, we theoretically analyze the
pitfalls of existing evaluation metrics when applied to multiclass local
calibration. Third, we propose a practical method for enhancing local
calibration in Neural Networks, which enforces alignment between predicted
probabilities and local estimates of class frequencies using the Jensen-Shannon
distance. Finally, we empirically validate our approach against existing
multiclass calibration techniques.

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of regression over distributions, which is
becoming increasingly important in machine learning. Existing approaches often
ignore the geometry of the probability space or are computationally expensive.
To overcome these limitations, a new method is proposed that combines the
parameterization of probability trajectories using a Bernstein basis and the
minimization of the Wasserstein distance between distributions. The key idea is
to model a conditional distribution as a smooth probability trajectory defined
by a weighted sum of Gaussian components whose parameters -- the mean and
covariance -- are functions of the input variable constructed using Bernstein
polynomials. The loss function is the averaged squared Wasserstein distance
between the predicted Gaussian distributions and the empirical data, which
takes into account the geometry of the distributions. An autodiff-based
optimization method is used to train the model. Experiments on synthetic
datasets that include complex trajectories demonstrated that the proposed
method provides competitive approximation quality in terms of the Wasserstein
distance, Energy Distance, and RMSE metrics, especially in cases of pronounced
nonlinearity. The model demonstrates trajectory smoothness that is better than
or comparable to alternatives and robustness to changes in data structure,
while maintaining high interpretability due to explicit parameterization via
control points. The developed approach represents a balanced solution that
combines geometric accuracy, computational practicality, and interpretability.
Prospects for further research include extending the method to non-Gaussian
distributions, applying entropy regularization to speed up computations, and
adapting the approach to working with high-dimensional data for approximating
surfaces and more complex structures.

Abstract: We introduce Aeolus, a large-scale Multi-modal Flight Delay Dataset designed
to advance research on flight delay prediction and support the development of
foundation models for tabular data. Existing datasets in this domain are
typically limited to flat tabular structures and fail to capture the
spatiotemporal dynamics inherent in delay propagation. Aeolus addresses this
limitation by providing three aligned modalities: (i) a tabular dataset with
rich operational, meteorological, and airportlevel features for over 50 million
flights; (ii) a flight chain module that models delay propagation along
sequential flight legs, capturing upstream and downstream dependencies; and
(iii) a flight network graph that encodes shared aircraft, crew, and airport
resource connections, enabling cross-flight relational reasoning. The dataset
is carefully constructed with temporal splits, comprehensive features, and
strict leakage prevention to support realistic and reproducible machine
learning evaluation. Aeolus supports a broad range of tasks, including
regression, classification, temporal structure modeling, and graph learning,
serving as a unified benchmark across tabular, sequential, and graph
modalities. We release baseline experiments and preprocessing tools to
facilitate adoption. Aeolus fills a key gap for both domain-specific modeling
and general-purpose structured data research.Our source code and data can be

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has the potential to solve various combinatorial
tasks, ranging from materials science to neural architecture search. However,
BO requires specialized kernels to effectively model combinatorial domains.
Recent efforts have introduced several combinatorial kernels, but the
relationships among them are not well understood. To bridge this gap, we
develop a unifying framework based on heat kernels, which we derive in a
systematic way and express as simple closed-form expressions. Using this
framework, we prove that many successful combinatorial kernels are either
related or equivalent to heat kernels, and validate this theoretical claim in
our experiments. Moreover, our analysis confirms and extends the results
presented in Bounce: certain algorithms' performance decreases substantially
when the unknown optima of the function do not have a certain structure. In
contrast, heat kernels are not sensitive to the location of the optima. Lastly,
we show that a fast and simple pipeline, relying on heat kernels, is able to
achieve state-of-the-art results, matching or even outperforming certain slow
or complex algorithms.

Motivation: 由于在异构时间序列数据集上不存在通用的最佳异常检测方法，需要开发基于时间序列特征的模型选择方法来为不同领域的时间序列选择最合适的异常检测方法。

Method: 评估了234种模型配置（来自16个基础分类器）在1980多个时间序列上的表现，首次对时间序列分类作为异常检测模型选择进行了广泛实验评估。

Conclusion: 时间序列分类算法在异常检测中具有准确性和效率优势，这是证明其在AutoML管道中模型选择有效性的第一步。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a fundamental task for time series analytics with
important implications for the downstream performance of many applications.
Despite increasing academic interest and the large number of methods proposed
in the literature, recent benchmarks and evaluation studies demonstrated that
no overall best anomaly detection methods exist when applied to very
heterogeneous time series datasets. Therefore, the only scalable and viable
solution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected
from diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select,
based on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection methods to
run. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable to
time series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-based
approaches for model selection exists. Towards that direction, this paper
studies the performance of time series classification methods used as model
selection for anomaly detection. In total, we evaluate 234 model configurations
derived from 16 base classifiers across more than 1980 time series, and we
propose the first extensive experimental evaluation of time series
classification as model selection for anomaly detection. Our results
demonstrate that model selection methods outperform every single anomaly
detection method while being in the same order of magnitude regarding execution
time. This evaluation is the first step to demonstrate the accuracy and
efficiency of time series classification algorithms for anomaly detection, and
represents a strong baseline that can then be used to guide the model selection
step in general AutoML pipelines. Preprint version of an article accepted at

Motivation: 许多现实系统（如单细胞RNA中的细胞周期）表现出非梯度、周期性行为，现有基于最小作用原理的方法无法准确建模这类系统。

Method: 设计并求解带有非零漂移参考过程的薛定谔桥问题，使用推断速度结合群体快照数据构建参考过程。

Conclusion: Curly-FM将流匹配模型扩展到物理系统中已知周期性行为的建模，超越了仅对群体建模的限制。

Abstract: Modeling the transport dynamics of natural processes from population-level
observations is a ubiquitous problem in the natural sciences. Such models rely
on key assumptions about the underlying process in order to enable faithful
learning of governing dynamics that mimic the actual system behavior. The de
facto assumption in current approaches relies on the principle of least action
that results in gradient field dynamics and leads to trajectories minimizing an
energy functional between two probability measures. However, many real-world
systems, such as cell cycles in single-cell RNA, are known to exhibit
non-gradient, periodic behavior, which fundamentally cannot be captured by
current state-of-the-art methods such as flow and bridge matching. In this
paper, we introduce Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM), a novel approach that is
capable of learning non-gradient field dynamics by designing and solving a
Schr\"odinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process -- in
stark contrast to typical zero-drift reference processes -- which is
constructed using inferred velocities in addition to population snapshot data.
We showcase Curly-FM by solving the trajectory inference problems for single
cells, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean currents with approximate
velocities. We demonstrate that Curly-FM can learn trajectories that better
match both the reference process and population marginals. Curly-FM expands
flow matching models beyond the modeling of populations and towards the
modeling of known periodic behavior in physical systems. Our code repository is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Hardt和Roth提出的问题，即在差分隐私下计算矩阵前r个奇异向量跨度的问题，现有方法在某些情况下无法达到最优非私有算法的性能。

Method: 使用奇异值分解和标准扰动机制，基于秩r相干性和谱间隙来构建私有秩r近似。

Result: 该算法在密集设置下实现了与最优非私有算法相同的单峰PCA保证，而先前的私有算法未能做到。同时证明了秩r相干性在高斯扰动下不会增加。

Conclusion: 提出的简单算法在差分隐私下能有效计算奇异向量跨度，并在某些情况下达到最优性能，相干性概念还可应用于图问题中的差分隐私算法。

Abstract: We revisit the task of computing the span of the top $r$ singular vectors
$u_1, \ldots, u_r$ of a matrix under differential privacy. We show that a
simple and efficient algorithm -- based on singular value decomposition and
standard perturbation mechanisms -- returns a private rank-$r$ approximation
whose error depends only on the \emph{rank-$r$ coherence} of $u_1, \ldots, u_r$
and the spectral gap $\sigma_r - \sigma_{r+1}$. This resolves a question posed
by Hardt and Roth~\cite{hardt2013beyond}. Our estimator outperforms the state
of the art -- significantly so in some regimes. In particular, we show that in
the dense setting, it achieves the same guarantees for single-spike PCA in the
Wishart model as those attained by optimal non-private algorithms, whereas
prior private algorithms failed to do so.
  In addition, we prove that (rank-$r$) coherence does not increase under
Gaussian perturbations. This implies that any estimator based on the Gaussian
mechanism -- including ours -- preserves the coherence of the input. We
conjecture that similar behavior holds for other structured models, including
planted problems in graphs.
  We also explore applications of coherence to graph problems. In particular,
we present a differentially private algorithm for Max-Cut and other constraint
satisfaction problems under low coherence assumptions.

TL;DR: LoRAQuant是一种针对LoRA适配器的混合精度后训练量化方法，通过SVD重参数化将重要信息集中到特定行列，实现重要组件高精度量化、其余部分超低比特量化，显著降低比特数同时保持或提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA适配器在同时加载多个时会带来显著的聚合成本，需要一种高效的量化方法来减少存储和计算开销。

Method: 使用奇异值分解(SVD)对每个适配器进行重参数化，将重要信息集中到特定行列，然后对重要组件采用高精度量化，其余部分采用超低比特量化。

Result: 在LLaMA 2-7B、LLaMA 2-13B和Mistral 7B模型上的数学推理、编程和摘要任务实验表明，LoRAQuant比其他量化方法使用显著更低的比特数，但获得相当甚至更高的性能。

Conclusion: LoRAQuant是一种有效的LoRA适配器量化方法，能够在显著降低比特数的同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular technique for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). In many
real-world scenarios, multiple adapters are loaded simultaneously to enable LLM
customization for personalized user experiences or to support a diverse range
of tasks. Although each adapter is lightweight in isolation, their aggregate
cost becomes substantial at scale. To address this, we propose LoRAQuant, a
mixed-precision post-training quantization method tailored to LoRA.
Specifically, LoRAQuant reparameterizes each adapter by singular value
decomposition (SVD) to concentrate the most important information into specific
rows and columns. This makes it possible to quantize the important components
to higher precision, while quantizing the rest to ultra-low bitwidth. We
conduct comprehensive experiments with LLaMA 2-7B, LLaMA 2-13B, and Mistral 7B
models on mathematical reasoning, coding, and summarization tasks. Results show
that our LoRAQuant uses significantly lower bits than other quantization
methods, but achieves comparable or even higher performance.

Motivation: 标准延迟算法训练需要为每个训练实例查询所有专家，这在专家查询成本高昂时变得不可行，违背了延迟的核心目标。

Result: 在多个领域的实证结果显示，算法显著降低训练成本而不牺牲预测准确性。

Conclusion: 预算感知延迟算法具有实际价值，能够在保持性能的同时有效控制训练成本。

Abstract: Learning to defer uncertain predictions to costly experts offers a powerful
strategy for improving the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning systems.
However, standard training procedures for deferral algorithms typically require
querying all experts for every training instance, an approach that becomes
prohibitively expensive when expert queries incur significant computational or
resource costs. This undermines the core goal of deferral: to limit unnecessary
expert usage. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the budgeted deferral
framework, which aims to train effective deferral algorithms while minimizing
expert query costs during training. We propose new algorithms for both
two-stage and single-stage multiple-expert deferral settings that selectively
query only a subset of experts per training example. While inspired by active
learning, our setting is fundamentally different: labels are already known, and
the core challenge is to decide which experts to query in order to balance cost
and predictive performance. We establish theoretical guarantees for both of our
algorithms, including generalization bounds and label complexity analyses.
Empirical results across several domains show that our algorithms substantially
reduce training costs without sacrificing prediction accuracy, demonstrating
the practical value of our budget-aware deferral algorithms.

Motivation: 解决分布式机器学习中的通信瓶颈问题。现有梯度压缩方法存在局限：Rand-K丢弃结构信息且性能不佳，Top-K保留重要信息但缺乏压缩特性且需要昂贵的All-Gather操作。

Method: 设计All-Reduce兼容的Top-K压缩器，使用轻量级梯度草图对齐跨节点的稀疏模式，结合动量误差反馈(EF21M)实现高效通信。

Result: ARC-Top-K在保持Top-K准确性的同时，将训练时间减少高达60.7%，实现了线性加速和更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: ARC-Top-K结合了Rand-K的鲁棒性和Top-K的强性能，提供了高效可扩展的通信解决方案。

Abstract: Communication remains a central bottleneck in large-scale distributed machine
learning, and gradient sparsification has emerged as a promising strategy to
alleviate this challenge. However, existing gradient compressors face notable
limitations: Rand-$K$\ discards structural information and performs poorly in
practice, while Top-$K$\ preserves informative entries but loses the
contraction property and requires costly All-Gather operations. In this paper,
we propose ARC-Top-$K$, an {All-Reduce}-Compatible Top-$K$ compressor that
aligns sparsity patterns across nodes using a lightweight sketch of the
gradient, enabling index-free All-Reduce while preserving globally significant
information. ARC-Top-$K$\ is provably contractive and, when combined with
momentum error feedback (EF21M), achieves linear speedup and sharper
convergence rates than the original EF21M under standard assumptions.
Empirically, ARC-Top-$K$\ matches the accuracy of Top-$K$\ while reducing
wall-clock training time by up to 60.7\%, offering an efficient and scalable
solution that combines the robustness of Rand-$K$\ with the strong performance
of Top-$K$.

Conclusion: 建议在机器遗忘算法的实证比较中，应考虑不同模型训练种子的变异性，以获得更准确的性能评估。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of certain data points
from a trained model without costly retraining. Most practical MU algorithms
are only approximate and their performance can only be assessed empirically.
Care must therefore be taken to make empirical comparisons as representative as
possible. A common practice is to run the MU algorithm multiple times
independently starting from the same trained model. In this work, we
demonstrate that this practice can give highly non-representative results
because -- even for the same architecture and same dataset -- some MU methods
can be highly sensitive to the choice of random number seed used for model
training. We therefore recommend that empirical
comphttps://info.arxiv.org/help/prep#commentsarisons of MU algorithms should
also reflect the variability across different model training seeds.

Conclusion: 该机制简单有效，在不同数据集规模下都能达到最优或改进的误差保证，是首个在纯差分隐私下实现谱范数最优误差的协方差估计器。

Abstract: We present a simple perturbation mechanism for the release of $d$-dimensional
covariance matrices $\Sigma$ under pure differential privacy. For large
datasets with at least $n\geq d^2/\varepsilon$ elements, our mechanism recovers
the provably optimal Frobenius norm error guarantees of
\cite{nikolov2023private}, while simultaneously achieving best known error for
all other $p$-Schatten norms, with $p\in [1,\infty]$. Our error is
information-theoretically optimal for all $p\ge 2$, in particular, our
mechanism is the first purely private covariance estimator that achieves
optimal error in spectral norm.
  For small datasets $n< d^2/\varepsilon$, we further show that by projecting
the output onto the nuclear norm ball of appropriate radius, our algorithm
achieves the optimal Frobenius norm error $O(\sqrt{d\;\text{Tr}(\Sigma) /n})$,
improving over the known bounds of $O(\sqrt{d/n})$ of \cite{nikolov2023private}

Motivation: 现有的OTA-FL设计在异构无线场景下受到最弱设备的限制，导致更新方差膨胀。此外，先前对带偏差OTA-FL的分析主要针对凸目标函数，而大多数现代AI模型都是高度非凸的。

Method: 开发了新颖的OTA-FL SGD更新方法，允许结构化、时不变的模型偏差，同时促进方差减少的更新。提出了非凸联合OTA功率控制设计，并开发了仅需基站统计CSI的高效连续凸逼近(SCA)算法。

Result: 在非凸图像分类任务上的实验验证了该方法：基于SCA的设计通过优化偏差加速了收敛，并相比先前的OTA-FL基线提高了泛化性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为异构无线场景下的OTA-FL提供了一种有效的解决方案，通过优化偏差-方差权衡实现了更好的收敛性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a
scalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless
multiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing
OTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming
\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or
forcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \emph{heterogeneous}
wireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device
and inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL
largely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly
non-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless
heterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,
time-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We
derive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient
norm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this
trade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an
efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only
statistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image
classification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates
convergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL
baselines.

Conclusion: STaMP量化策略能有效维持模型在低平均激活比特宽度下的精度，是对现有量化方法的重要补充。

Abstract: Quantization is the key method for reducing inference latency, power and
memory footprint of generative AI models. However, accuracy often degrades
sharply when activations are quantized below eight bits. Recent work suggests
that invertible linear transformations (e.g. rotations) can aid quantization,
by reparameterizing feature channels and weights. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Sequence Transformation and Mixed Precision} (STaMP) quantization, a
novel strategy that applies linear transformations along the \textit{sequence}
dimension to exploit the strong local correlation in language and visual data.
By keeping a small number of tokens in each intermediate activation at higher
precision, we can maintain model accuracy at lower (average) activations
bit-widths. We evaluate STaMP on recent LVM and LLM architectures,
demonstrating that it significantly improves low bit width activation
quantization and complements established activation and weight quantization
methods including recent feature transformations.

Abstract: How can we explain the influence of training data on black-box models?
Influence functions (IFs) offer a post-hoc solution by utilizing gradients and
Hessians. However, computing the Hessian for an entire dataset is
resource-intensive, necessitating a feasible alternative. A common approach
involves randomly sampling a small subset of the training data, but this method
often results in highly inconsistent IF estimates due to the high variance in
sample configurations. To address this, we propose two advanced sampling
techniques based on features and logits. These samplers select a small yet
representative subset of the entire dataset by considering the stochastic
distribution of features or logits, thereby enhancing the accuracy of IF
estimations. We validate our approach through class removal experiments, a
typical application of IFs, using the F1-score to measure how effectively the
model forgets the removed class while maintaining inference consistency on the
remaining classes. Our method reduces computation time by 30.1% and memory
usage by 42.2%, or improves the F1-score by 2.5% compared to the baseline.

Abstract: Recent research on time series foundation models has primarily focused on
forecasting, leaving it unclear how generalizable their learned representations
are. In this study, we examine whether frozen pre-trained forecasting models
can provide effective representations for classification. To this end, we
compare different representation extraction strategies and introduce two
model-agnostic embedding augmentations. Our experiments show that the best
forecasting models achieve classification accuracy that matches or even
surpasses that of state-of-the-art models pre-trained specifically for
classification. Moreover, we observe a positive correlation between forecasting
and classification performance. These findings challenge the assumption that
task-specific pre-training is necessary, and suggest that learning to forecast
may provide a powerful route toward constructing general-purpose time series
foundation models.

Abstract: We study the ability of Transformer models to learn sequences generated by
Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs), a widely used family of pseudo-random
number generators (PRNGs). PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty
over linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wise
shifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show that
Transformers can nevertheless successfully perform in-context prediction on
unseen sequences from diverse PCG variants, in tasks that are beyond published
classical attacks. In our experiments we scale moduli up to $2^{22}$ using up
to $50$ million model parameters and datasets with up to $5$ billion tokens.
Surprisingly, we find even when the output is truncated to a single bit, it can
be reliably predicted by the model. When multiple distinct PRNGs are presented
together during training, the model can jointly learn them, identifying
structures from different permutations. We demonstrate a scaling law with
modulus $m$: the number of in-context sequence elements required for
near-perfect prediction grows as $\sqrt{m}$. For larger moduli, optimization
enters extended stagnation phases; in our experiments, learning moduli $m \geq
2^{20}$ requires incorporating training data from smaller moduli, demonstrating
a critical necessity for curriculum learning. Finally, we analyze embedding
layers and uncover a novel clustering phenomenon: the model spontaneously
groups the integer inputs into bitwise rotationally-invariant clusters,
revealing how representations can transfer from smaller to larger moduli.
