We analyse the\nefficiency of turbulence for different flows using numerical and experimental\ndata. Our analysis suggests that efficiency is bounded from above, and, in some\ncases, saturates following a power law reminiscent of phase transitions and\nbifurcations. We show that for the von K{\\'a}rm{\\'a}n flow the efficiency\nsaturation is insensitive to the details of the forcing impellers. In the case\nof Rayleigh-B{\\'e}nard convection, we show that within the Grossman and Lohse\nmodel, the efficiency saturates in the inviscid limit, while the dimensionless\nkinetic energy injection/dissipation goes to zero.

While much of\nthe existing literature has focused on idealized configurations with regularly\nspaced roughness elements, real-world surfaces often feature irregularities,\nclustering, and topographic complexity for which the secondary flow response\nremains poorly understood. To address this gap, we investigate multi-column\nroughness configurations that serve as a regularized analog of roughness\nclustering. Using large-eddy simulations, we systematically examine the effects\nof cluster density and local arrangement on secondary flows, and observe that\nvarying the cluster density gives rise to distinct secondary flow polarities.\nThrough a systematic parameter study, we identify the spanwise gap between the\nedge-most roughness elements of adjacent columns, normalized by the channel\nhalf-height, as a key geometric factor governing this polarity. In addition to\nanalyzing the time-averaged structure, we investigate how variations in\npolarity affect the instantaneous dynamics of secondary flows. Here, we find\nthat the regions of high- and low-momentum fluid created by the secondary flows\nalternate in a chaotic, non-periodic manner over time. Further analysis of the\nvertical velocity signal shows that variability in vertical momentum transport\nis a persistent and intrinsic feature of secondary flow dynamics.

With minimal\nuser input - following a protocol to label variables as stocks,\nflows/auxiliaries, or constants - D2D leverages the structural information\nalready encoded in CLDs, namely, link existence and polarity, to simulate\nhypothetical interventions and explore potential leverage points under\nuncertainty. Results suggest that D2D helps distinguish between high- and\nlow-ranked leverage points. We compare D2D to a data-driven SDM constructed\nfrom the same CLD and variable labeling. D2D showed greater consistency with\nthe data-driven model than network centrality analysis, while providing\nuncertainty estimates and guidance for future data collection. The method is\nimplemented in an open-source Python package and a web-based application to\nsupport further testing and lower the barrier to dynamic modeling for\nresearchers working with CLDs.

Transfer-based\nattacks create adversarial examples for surrogate models and transfer these\nexamples to target models under black-box scenarios. Recent studies reveal that\nadversarial examples in flat loss landscapes exhibit superior transferability\nto alleviate overfitting on surrogate models. However, the prior arts overlook\nthe influence of perturbation directions, resulting in limited transferability.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel attack method, named Residual Perturbation\nAttack (ResPA), relying on the residual gradient as the perturbation direction\nto guide the adversarial examples toward the flat regions of the loss function.\nSpecifically, ResPA conducts an exponential moving average on the input\ngradients to obtain the first moment as the reference gradient, which\nencompasses the direction of historical gradients. Instead of heavily relying\non the local flatness that stems from the current gradients as the perturbation\ndirection, ResPA further considers the residual between the current gradient\nand the reference gradient to capture the changes in the global perturbation\ndirection.

The flow is highly irregular due to the complex interaction\nbetween the flapping jet emanating from the gap and the vortices shed in the\nwake.

Contours of the time-averaged CLVs\nreveal that the footprint of the leading CLV is in the near-wake, whereas the\nother CLVs peak further downstream, indicating distinct regions of instability.\nSPOD of the two unstable CLVs is then employed to extract the dominant coherent\nstructures and oscillation frequencies in the tangent space. For the leading\nCLV, the two dominant frequencies match closely with the prevalent frequencies\nin the drag coefficient spectrum, and correspond to instabilities due to vortex\nshedding and jet-flapping. The second unstable CLV captures the subharmonic\ninstability of the shedding frequency. Global linear stability analysis (GLSA)\nof the time-averaged flow identifies a neutral eigenmode that resembles the\nleading SPOD mode of the first CLV, with a very similar structure and\nfrequency.

Due to the few-shot learning paradigm, the OOD\ndetection ability is often overfit to the limited training data itself, thus\ndegrading the performance on generalized data and performing inconsistently\nacross different scenarios. To address this challenge, we proposed a\nGeneralized Few-shot OOD Detection (GOOD) framework, which empowers the general\nknowledge of the OOD detection model with an auxiliary General Knowledge Model\n(GKM), instead of directly learning from few-shot data. We proceed to reveal\nthe few-shot OOD detection from a generalization perspective and theoretically\nderive the Generality-Specificity balance (GS-balance) for OOD detection, which\nprovably reduces the upper bound of generalization error with a general\nknowledge model. Accordingly, we propose a Knowledge Dynamic Embedding (KDE)\nmechanism to adaptively modulate the guidance of general knowledge. KDE\ndynamically aligns the output distributions of the OOD detection model to the\ngeneral knowledge model based on the Generalized Belief (G-Belief) of GKM,\nthereby boosting the GS-balance.

This study couples the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method with an\nenthalpy-porous media phase change model to distinguish the water (ice)-oil\ntwo-phase system and the water-ice two-phase system, respectively.The\nsimulation reveals two distinct solidification patterns: Pattern I exhibits a\nuniform and symmetric pattern, occurring at lower Reynolds numbers (Re) or\ndroplet-to-channel diameter ratios (D/W), resulting in a relatively even solid\nshell along the interface with synchronized solidification fronts in both flow\nand spanwise directions, dominated by heat conduction. Pattern II shows a\nshear-constraint cooperative non-uniform pattern at higher Reynolds numbers and\nD/W ratios, where flow dynamics and spatial confinement couple, leading to\nfaster solidification at the tail region and an asymmetric solidification\nfront.

We introduce\nHolistic-XAI (H-XAI), a unified framework that integrates causal rating methods\nwith traditional XAI methods to support explanation as an interactive,\nmulti-method process. H-XAI allows stakeholders to ask a series of questions,\ntest hypotheses, and compare model behavior against automatically constructed\nrandom and biased baselines. It combines instance-level and global\nexplanations, adapting to each stakeholder's goals, whether understanding\nindividual decisions, assessing group-level bias, or evaluating robustness\nunder perturbations. We demonstrate the generality of our approach through two\ncase studies spanning six scenarios: binary credit risk classification and\nfinancial time-series forecasting.

However, real-world utility data originates from multiple sources\nwith varying characteristics and levels of quality. In this work, developed in\ncollaboration with Oncor Electric Delivery, we propose a scalable framework\nthat reconstructs a trustworthy grid topology by systematically integrating\nheterogeneous data. We observe that distribution topology is fundamentally\ngoverned by two complementary dimensions: the spatial layout of physical\ninfrastructure (e.g., GIS and asset metadata) and the dynamic behavior of the\nsystem in the signal domain (e.g., voltage time series). When jointly\nleveraged, these dimensions support a complete and physically coherent\nreconstruction of network connectivity. To address the challenge of uneven data\nquality without compromising observability, we introduce a confidence-aware\ninference mechanism that preserves structurally informative yet imperfect\ninputs, while quantifying the reliability of each inferred connection for\noperator interpretation. This soft handling of uncertainty is tightly coupled\nwith hard enforcement of physical feasibility: we embed operational\nconstraints, such as transformer capacity limits and radial topology\nrequirements, directly into the learning process. Together, these components\nensure that inference is both uncertainty-aware and structurally valid,\nenabling rapid convergence to actionable, trustworthy topologies under\nreal-world deployment conditions.

IEEE, 2024", "summary": "Understanding the thermal and flow fields associated with natural convection\nis of great importance in the design and manufacture of passive cooling\nsystems, solar collectors, and ventilation systems. The aim of this study is to\nnumerically investigate the naturally driven flow behaviour in open-ended\nvertical channels. Specifically, laminar airflow (Rayleigh number of 5*10^5) is\nnaturally driven through a vertical channel that is asymmetrically heated with\na uniform heat flux of (2043 w/m^2) . The compressible OpenFOAM solver\n(buoyantPimpleFoam) is employed, and open boundary conditions are applied at\nboth the inlet and outlet to account for the effect of ventilation. The results\nexhibit good agreement with a numerical benchmark. Furthermore, a study of the\nairflow through two vertical channels, with two different aspect ratios of 5\nand 31.25, is conducted. The results indicate that, in both cases of aspect\nratios, the flow accelerates near the heated wall and decelerates near the\nadiabatic wall, forming a near-constant velocity region around the channel\ncentreline. Increasing the aspect ratio diminishes the reverse flow. However,\nthe flow pattern near the heated wall remains largely unaffected by aspect\nratio changes.

Bryant"], "title": "Numerical Considerations in Weighted Model Counting", "comment": null, "summary": "Weighted model counting computes the sum of the rational-valued weights\nassociated with the satisfying assignments for a Boolean formula, where the\nweight of an assignment is given by the product of the weights assigned to the\npositive and negated variables comprising the assignment. Weighted model\ncounting finds applications across a variety of domains including probabilistic\nreasoning and quantitative risk assessment.\n  Most weighted model counting programs operate by (explicitly or implicitly)\nconverting the input formula into a form that enables arithmetic evaluation,\nusing multiplication for conjunctions and addition for disjunctions. Performing\nthis evaluation using floating-point arithmetic can yield inaccurate results,\nand it cannot quantify the level of precision achieved. Computing with rational\narithmetic gives exact results, but it is costly in both time and space.\n  This paper describes how to combine multiple numeric representations to\nefficiently compute weighted model counts that are guaranteed to achieve a\nuser-specified precision.

The MDP model also incorporates analytical models for\nconjunction risk, propellant consumption, and transit orbit geometry. The\nMarkov policy effectively trades-off maneuver delay-which improves the\nreliability of conjunction risk indicators-with propellant consumption-which\nincreases with decreasing maneuver time. Using historical data of tracked\nconjunction events, we verify this framework and conduct an extensive ablation\nstudy on the hyper-parameters used within the MDP. On synthetic conjunction\nevents, the trained policy significantly minimizes both the overall and average\npropellant consumption per CAM when compared to a conventional cut-off policy\nthat initiates maneuvers 24 hours before the time of closest approach (TCA).

Among them, the Swin\nTransformer stands out for its ability to capture hierarchical, multi-scale\nrepresentations, making it a popular backbone for segmentation in videos.\nHowever, despite its window-attention scheme, it still incurs a high\ncomputational cost, especially in larger variants commonly used for dense\nprediction in videos.

Meanwhile, training-free token clustering\napproaches have shown promise in image segmentation while maintaining window\nconsistency. Nevertheless, they fail to exploit temporal redundancy, missing a\nkey opportunity to further optimize video segmentation performance. We\nintroduce Temporal Cluster Assignment (TCA), a lightweight and effective,\nfine-tuning-free strategy that enhances token clustering by leveraging temporal\ncoherence across frames. Instead of indiscriminately dropping redundant tokens,\nTCA refines token clusters using temporal correlations, thereby retaining\nfine-grained details while significantly reducing computation.

The relationship between the particle distribution, the MPI core\nresponse and the measured data is given by a mathematical model which was\nintroduced in our earlier research. According to this model the MPI core\nresponse is tied to the particle distribution by convolution.

While exact algorithms based on MILP, CP, SAT, or dynamic\nprogramming guarantee optimality, they often suffer from poor anytime behavior\n-- meaning they struggle to find high-quality decision trees quickly when the\nsearch is stopped before completion -- due to unbalanced search space\nexploration.

By introducing\nstructured, post-hoc sparsity to the attention mechanism of a DistilBERT model\nduring fine-tuning on the SST-2 sentiment analysis task, we find that model\naccuracy improves significantly. Our model with 80\\% attention sparsity\nachieves a validation accuracy of 91.59\\%, a 0.97\\% absolute improvement over\nthe dense baseline. We hypothesize that this phenomenon is due to sparsity\nacting as a powerful implicit regularizer, preventing the model from\noverfitting by forcing it to make predictions with a more constrained and\nrobust set of features. Our work recasts attention sparsity not just as a tool\nfor computational efficiency, but as a potential method for improving the\ngeneralization and performance of Transformer models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728DistilBERT\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u540e\u9a8c\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728SST-2\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u666e\u904d\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e8c\u6b21\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u5728DistilBERT\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u540e\u9a8c\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728SST-2\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "80%\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523091.59%\uff0c\u6bd4\u5bc6\u96c6\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e860.97%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9690\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To resolve this problem,pruning operation is a crucial part in\noptimizing decision trees, as it not only reduces the complexity of trees but\nalso decreases the probability of generating overfit models. The conventional\npruning techniques like Cost-Complexity Pruning (CCP) and Reduced Error Pruning\n(REP) are mostly based on greedy approaches that focus on immediate gains in\nperformance while pruning nodes of the decision tree. However, this might\nresult in a lower generalization in the long run, compromising the robust\nability of the tree model when introduced to unseen data samples, particularly\nwhen trained with small and complex datasets. To address this challenge, we are\nproposing a Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB)-based pruning approach, a reinforcement\nlearning (RL)-based technique, that will dynamically prune the tree to generate\nan optimal decision tree with better generalization.

It then iteratively applies spatial\nconstraints derived from the VLMs to achieve semantically coherent and\nphysically plausible layouts. Human evaluations and CLIP-based assessments\ndemonstrate that HOLODECK 2.0 effectively generates high-quality scenes closely\naligned with detailed textual descriptions, consistently outperforming\nbaselines across indoor and open-domain scenarios.

In\nthis paper, we propose ASAP (Anchor-guided, Surprisal-based Pruning), a novel\ncoarse-to-fine framework for CoT compression. ASAP first performs anchor-guided\npruning to preserve the core reasoning structure, which efficiently reduces the\nsearch space for subsequent processing. It then enables a logic-aware pruning\nby selecting logically essential reasoning steps based on a novel first-token\nsurprisal metric. Finally, ASAP teaches models to autonomously generate and\nleverage these concise CoTs at inference time, enabling efficient reasoning in\ncoding tasks.

This, combined with on-board integrated\nchips for image and signal processing, makes the cell phone a versatile\npocket-sized computational imaging platform.

Recent diffusion-based methods have\ndemonstrated significant potential in 2D-to-3D implicit mapping, they rely on\ndata-driven statistical priors and miss the explicit modeling of light-surface\ninteraction, leading to multi-view normal direction conflicts. Moreover, the\ndiscrete sampling mechanism of diffusion models causes gradient discontinuity\nin differentiable rendering reconstruction modules, preventing 3D geometric\nerrors from being backpropagated to the normal generation network, thereby\nforcing existing methods to depend on dense normal annotations. This paper\nproposes SINGAD, a novel Self-supervised framework from a single Image for\nNormal estimation via 3D GAussian splatting guided Diffusion. By integrating\nphysics-driven light-interaction modeling and a differentiable rendering-based\nreprojection strategy, our framework directly converts 3D geometric errors into\nnormal optimization signals, solving the challenges of multi-view geometric\ninconsistency and data dependency. Specifically, the framework constructs a\nlight-interaction-driven 3DGS reparameterization model to generate multi-scale\ngeometric features consistent with light transport principles, ensuring\nmulti-view normal consistency. A cross-domain feature fusion module is designed\nwithin a conditional diffusion model, embedding geometric priors to constrain\nnormal generation while maintaining accurate geometric error propagation.\nFurthermore, a differentiable 3D reprojection loss strategy is introduced for\nself-supervised optimization that minimizes geometric error between the\nreconstructed and input image, eliminating dependence on annotated normal\ndatasets.

A key technique in merging methods is sparsification, which\nprunes redundant parameters from task vectors to mitigate interference.\nHowever, prevailing approaches employ a ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy,\napplying a uniform sparsity ratio that overlooks the inherent structural and\nstatistical heterogeneity of model parameters. This often leads to a suboptimal\ntrade-off, where critical parameters are inadvertently pruned while less useful\nones are retained. To address this limitation, we introduce \\textbf{TADrop}\n(\\textbf{T}ensor-wise \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{Drop}), an adaptive\nsparsification strategy that respects this heterogeneity. Instead of a global\nratio, TADrop assigns a tailored sparsity level to each parameter tensor based\non its distributional properties. The core intuition is that tensors with\ndenser, more redundant distributions can be pruned aggressively, while sparser,\nmore critical ones are preserved. As a simple and plug-and-play module, we\nvalidate TADrop by integrating it with foundational, classic, and SOTA merging\nmethods. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks (vision, language, and\nmultimodal) and models (ViT, BEiT) demonstrate that TADrop consistently and\nsignificantly boosts their performance. For instance, when enhancing a leading\nmerging method, it achieves an average performance gain of 2.0\\% across 8\nViT-B/32 tasks.

Nevertheless, here we show that a similar intuition can be\nfleshed out in a different way: whenever an agent is able to perform a\nregulation task, it is possible for an observer to interpret it as having\n\"beliefs\" about its environment, which it \"updates\" in response to sensory\ninput. This notion of belief updating provides a notion of model that is more\nsophisticated than Conant and Ashby's, as well as a theorem that is more\nbroadly applicable.

With the emergence of large language models\n(LLMs) in communicative contexts, this understanding needs to be further\nrefined and methodologically reconsidered. The first section challenges the\ntraditional semiotic trichotomy, arguing that connectionist LLM architectures\ndestabilize established hierarchies of meaning, and proposes the Human-Machine\nCommunication (HMC) framework as a more suitable alternative. The second\nsection examines the tension between human-centred pragmatic theories and the\nmachine-centred nature of LLMs. While traditional, Gricean-inspired pragmatics\ncontinue to dominate, it relies on human-specific assumptions ill-suited to\npredictive systems like LLMs. Probabilistic pragmatics, particularly the\nRational Speech Act framework, offers a more compatible teleology by focusing\non optimization rather than truth-evaluation. The third section addresses the\nissue of substitutionalism in three forms - generalizing, linguistic, and\ncommunicative - highlighting the anthropomorphic biases that distort LLM\nevaluation and obscure the role of human communicative subjects. Finally, the\npaper introduces the concept of context frustration to describe the paradox of\nincreased contextual input paired with a collapse in contextual understanding,\nemphasizing how users are compelled to co-construct pragmatic conditions both\nfor the model and themselves. These arguments suggest that pragmatic theory may\nneed to be adjusted or expanded to better account for communication involving\ngenerative AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u8bed\u7528\u5b66\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4eba\u673a\u901a\u4fe1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4f20\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u4e0eLLM\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8bed\u7528\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8eLLM\uff0c\u9700\u8c03\u6574\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u6311\u6218\u4f20\u7edf\u7b26\u53f7\u4e09\u5206\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4eba\u673a\u901a\u4fe1\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u6982\u7387\u8bed\u7528\u5b66\uff08\u5982\u7406\u6027\u8a00\u8bed\u884c\u4e3a\u6846\u67b6\uff09\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff1b\u8ba8\u8bba\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e3b\u4e49\u95ee\u9898\u53ca\u8bed\u5883\u632b\u6298\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8bed\u7528\u5b66\u9700\u6269\u5c55\u4ee5\u6db5\u76d6LLM\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u6982\u7387\u8bed\u7528\u5b66\u66f4\u9002\u914d\uff1b\u8bed\u5883\u632b\u6298\u73b0\u8c61\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5171\u540c\u6784\u5efa\u8bed\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u7528\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u9700\u8c03\u6574\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u9002\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u8bed\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u6784\u5efa\u3002"}}

While continuing pre-training on large\ncorpora or employing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven\nsuccessful, updating an LLM with only a few thousand or million tokens remains\nchallenging. In this work, we investigate the task of injecting small,\nunstructured information into LLMs and its relation to the catastrophic\nforgetting phenomenon. We use a dataset of recent news -- ensuring no overlap\nwith the model's pre-training data -- to evaluate the knowledge acquisition by\nprobing the model with question-answer pairs related the learned information.\nStarting from a continued pre-training baseline, we explored different\naugmentation algorithms to generate synthetic data to improve the knowledge\nacquisition capabilities. Our experiments show that simply continuing\npre-training on limited data yields modest improvements, whereas exposing the\nmodel to diverse textual variations significantly improves the learning of new\nfacts -- particularly with methods that induce greater variability through\ndiverse prompting. Furthermore, we shed light on the forgetting phenomenon in\nsmall-data regimes, illustrating the delicate balance between learning new\ncontent and retaining existing capabilities.

These models have gained attention due to their robust performance on\nvarious tasks, including language processing tasks. These models achieve\nunderstanding and comprehension of tasks by training billions of parameters.\nThe development of these models is a transformative force in enhancing natural\nlanguage understanding and has taken a significant step towards artificial\ngeneral intelligence (AGI). In this study, we aim to present the DKG-LLM\nframework. The DKG-LLM framework introduces a groundbreaking approach to\nmedical diagnosis and personalized treatment recommendations by integrating a\ndynamic knowledge graph (DKG) with the Grok 3 large language model. Using the\nAdaptive Semantic Fusion Algorithm (ASFA), heterogeneous medical data\n(including clinical reports and PubMed articles) and patient records\ndynamically generate a knowledge graph consisting of 15,964 nodes in 13\ndistinct types (e.g., diseases, symptoms, treatments, patient profiles) and\n127,392 edges in 26 relationship types (e.g., causal, therapeutic,\nassociation). ASFA utilizes advanced probabilistic models, Bayesian inference,\nand graph optimization to extract semantic information, dynamically updating\nthe graph with approximately 150 new nodes and edges in each data category\nwhile maintaining scalability with up to 987,654 edges.

A Real Scene Benchmark for Evaluating Math Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models", "comment": "29 pages, 16 figures", "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable\ncapabilities in visual mathematical reasoning across various existing\nbenchmarks. However, these benchmarks are predominantly based on clean or\nprocessed multimodal inputs, without incorporating the images provided by\nreal-world Kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12) educational users. To address\nthis gap, we introduce MathReal, a meticulously curated dataset comprising\n2,000 mathematical questions with images captured by handheld mobile devices in\nauthentic scenarios. Each question is an image, containing the question text\nand visual element. We systematically classify the real images into three\nprimary categories: image quality degradation, perspective variation, and\nirrelevant content interference, which are further delineated into 14\nsubcategories. Additionally, MathReal spans five core knowledge and ability\ncategories, which encompass three question types and are divided into three\ndifficulty levels. To comprehensively evaluate the multimodal mathematical\nreasoning abilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs in real-world scenarios, we\ndesign six experimental settings that enable a systematic analysis of their\nperformance. Through extensive experimentation, we find that the\nproblem-solving abilities of existing MLLMs are significantly challenged in\nrealistic educational contexts. Based on this, we conduct a thorough analysis\nof their performance and error patterns, providing insights into their\nrecognition, comprehension, and reasoning capabilities, and outlining\ndirections for future improvements.

We define this problem as Partial Feature Membership Inference (PFMI).\nTo address this problem, we propose MRAD (Memory-guided Reconstruction and\nAnomaly Detection), a two-stage attack framework. In the first stage, MRAD\noptimizes the unknown feature values to minimize the loss of the sample. In the\nsecond stage, it measures the deviation between the reconstructed sample and\nthe training distribution using anomaly detection. Empirical results\ndemonstrate that MRAD is effective across a range of datasets, and maintains\ncompatibility with various off-the-shelf anomaly detection techniques.

However, most current approaches use only a\nsingle type of graph representation, namely Topology Representation Form (TRF),\nsuch as prompt-unified text descriptions or style-fixed visual styles. Those\n\"one-size-fits-all\" approaches fail to consider the specific preferences of\ndifferent models or tasks, often leading to incorrect or overly long responses.\nTo address this, we first analyze the characteristics and weaknesses of\nexisting TRFs, and then design a set of TRFs, denoted by $F_{ZS}$, tailored to\nzero-shot graph QA. We then introduce a new metric, Graph Response Efficiency\n(GRE), which measures the balance between the performance and the brevity in\ngraph QA. Built on these, we develop the DynamicTRF framework, which aims to\nimprove both the accuracy and conciseness of graph QA.

Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat VQAThinker achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and OOD\nVQA benchmarks, showing strong generalization for video quality scoring.\nFurthermore, evaluations on video quality understanding tasks validate its\nsuperiority in distortion attribution and quality description compared to\nexisting explainable VQA models and LMMs. These findings demonstrate that\nreinforcement learning offers an effective pathway toward building\ngeneralizable and explainable VQA models solely with score-level supervision.", "AI": {"tldr": "VQAThinker\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VQA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528GRPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u79cdVQA\u7279\u5b9a\u5956\u52b1\uff08\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5956\u52b1\uff09\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9886\u57df\u5185\u548cOOD\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5931\u771f\u5f52\u56e0\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5206\u6570\u7ea7\u76d1\u7763\u6784\u5efa\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027VQA\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Traditional multilingual\nmodels, which require simultaneous access to all language data, are impractical\ndue to the sequential arrival of data and privacy constraints. Continual\nLearning (CL) offers a solution by enabling models to learn new languages\nsequentially without catastrophically forgetting previously learned knowledge.\nThis paper investigates CL for ASR on Indian languages using a subset of the\nIndicSUPERB benchmark. We employ a Conformer-based hybrid RNN-T/CTC model,\ninitially pretrained on Hindi, which is then incrementally trained on eight\nadditional Indian languages, for a total sequence of nine languages. We\nevaluate three prominent regularization- and distillation-based CL strategies:\nElastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Memory Aware Synapses (MAS), and Learning\nwithout Forgetting (LwF), selected for their suitability in no-replay,\nprivacy-conscious scenarios. Performance is analyzed using Word Error Rate\n(WER) for both RNN-T and CTC paths on clean and noisy data, as well as\nknowledge retention via Backward Transfer.

However, there remains a significant research gap in combining\nthese capabilities to enable emotionally supportive interactions with virtual\ncharacters. To address this research gap, we focus on anime characters as a\ncase study because of their well-defined personalities and large fan bases.\nThis choice enables us to effectively evaluate how well LLMs can provide\nemotional support while maintaining specific character traits. We introduce\nChatAnime, the first Emotionally Supportive Role-Playing (ESRP) dataset. We\nfirst thoughtfully select 20 top-tier characters from popular anime communities\nand design 60 emotion-centric real-world scenario questions. Then, we execute a\nnationwide selection process to identify 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts with\nprofound knowledge of specific characters and extensive experience in\nrole-playing. Next, we systematically collect two rounds of dialogue data from\n10 LLMs and these 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts. To evaluate the ESRP\nperformance of LLMs, we design a user experience-oriented evaluation system\nfeaturing 9 fine-grained metrics across three dimensions: basic dialogue,\nrole-playing and emotional support, along with an overall metric for response\ndiversity. In total, the dataset comprises 2,400 human-written and 24,000\nLLM-generated answers, supported by over 132,000 human annotations.\nExperimental results show that top-performing LLMs surpass human fans in\nrole-playing and emotional support, while humans still lead in response\ndiversity.

Although both are\nclass-agnostic segmentation tasks that map from RGB space to binary space, the\nformer aims to identify the most salient objects in the image, while the latter\nfocuses on detecting perfectly camouflaged objects that blend into the\nbackground in the image. These two tasks exhibit strong contradictory\nattributes. Previous works have mostly believed that joint learning of these\ntwo tasks would confuse the network, reducing its performance on both tasks.\nHowever, here we present an opposite perspective: with the correct approach to\nlearning, the network can simultaneously possess the capability to find both\nsalient and camouflaged objects, allowing both tasks to benefit from joint\nlearning. We propose SCJoint, a joint learning scheme for SOD and COD tasks,\nassuming that the decoding processes of SOD and COD have different distribution\ncharacteristics. The key to our method is to learn the respective means and\nvariances of the decoding processes for both tasks by inserting a minimal\namount of task-specific learnable parameters within a fully shared network\nstructure, thereby decoupling the contradictory attributes of the two tasks at\na minimal cost. Furthermore, we propose a saliency-based sampling strategy\n(SBSS) to sample the training set of the SOD task to balance the training set\nsizes of the two tasks. In addition, SBSS improves the training set quality and\nshortens the training time. Based on the proposed SCJoint and SBSS, we train a\npowerful generalist network, named JoNet, which has the ability to\nsimultaneously capture both ``salient\" and ``camouflaged\".

Results show that LLMs fine-tuned in one or two languages\ncan reliably classify immigration-related content in unseen languages. However,\nidentifying whether a tweet expresses a pro- or anti-immigration stance\nbenefits from multilingual fine-tuning. Pre-training bias favours dominant\nlanguages, but even minimal exposure to under-represented languages during\nfine-tuning (as little as $9.62\\times10^{-11}$ of the original pre-training\ntoken volume) yields significant gains. These findings challenge the assumption\nthat cross-lingual mastery requires extensive multilingual training: limited\nlanguage coverage suffices for topic-level generalisation, and structural\nbiases can be corrected with lightweight interventions.

Built within the\nactive-passive loss framework, FCL employs the fractional derivative of the\nCross-Entropy (CE) loss as its active component and the Mean Absolute Error\n(MAE) as its passive loss component.

While several existing methods optimize attention\ncomputation, they still process the full set of hidden states at each layer,\nlimiting overall efficiency. In this work, we propose SlimInfer, an innovative\nframework that aims to accelerate inference by directly pruning less critical\nprompt tokens during the forward pass. Our key insight is an information\ndiffusion phenomenon: As information from critical tokens propagates through\nlayers, it becomes distributed across the entire sequence. This diffusion\nprocess suggests that LLMs can maintain their semantic integrity when excessive\ntokens, even including these critical ones, are pruned in hidden states.\nMotivated by this, SlimInfer introduces a dynamic fine-grained pruning\nmechanism that accurately removes redundant tokens of hidden state at\nintermediate layers. This layer-wise pruning naturally enables an asynchronous\nKV cache manager that prefetches required token blocks without complex\npredictors, reducing both memory usage and I/O costs.

The potential for intentional deception, where an LLM deliberately\nfabricates or conceals information to serve a hidden objective, remains a\nsignificant and underexplored threat. Existing studies typically induce such\ndeception by explicitly setting a \"hidden\" objective through prompting or\nfine-tuning, which may not fully reflect real-world human-LLM interactions.\nMoving beyond this human-induced deception, we investigate LLMs' self-initiated\ndeception on benign prompts. To address the absence of ground truth in this\nevaluation, we propose a novel framework using \"contact searching questions.\"\nThis framework introduces two statistical metrics derived from psychological\nprinciples to quantify the likelihood of deception.

Current mainstream VQA methods typically improve\nperformance by pretraining on large-scale classification datasets (e.g.,\nImageNet, Kinetics-400), followed by fine-tuning on VQA datasets. However, this\nstrategy presents two significant challenges: (1) merely transferring semantic\nknowledge learned from pretraining is insufficient for VQA, as video quality\ndepends on multiple factors (e.g., semantics, distortion, motion, aesthetics);\n(2) pretraining on large-scale datasets demands enormous computational\nresources, often dozens or even hundreds of times greater than training\ndirectly on VQA datasets. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown\nremarkable generalization capabilities across a wide range of visual tasks, and\nhave begun to demonstrate promising potential in quality assessment. In this\nwork, we propose Q-CLIP, the first fully VLMs-based framework for VQA. Q-CLIP\nenhances both visual and textual representations through a Shared Cross-Modal\nAdapter (SCMA), which contains only a minimal number of trainable parameters\nand is the only component that requires training. This design significantly\nreduces computational cost. In addition, we introduce a set of five learnable\nquality-level prompts to guide the VLMs in perceiving subtle quality\nvariations, thereby further enhancing the model's sensitivity to video quality.\nFurthermore, we investigate the impact of different frame sampling strategies\non VQA performance, and find that frame-difference-based sampling leads to\nbetter generalization performance across datasets.

Furthermore,\nthe end-to-end design enables our model to avoid cumbersome steps in the data\nannotation process. Extensive experimental results on multiple datasets\ndemonstrate that UGD-IML outperforms the SOTA methods by an average of 9.66 and\n4.36 in terms of F1 metrics for IML and CIML tasks, respectively.

However, existing\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially open-source ones, are\nstill falling behind with a typical success rate of 30%-50% on challenging\nbenchmarks. Previous studies on fine-tuning MLLMs with synthetic charts are\noften restricted by their inadequate similarity to the real charts, which could\ncompromise model training and performance on complex real-world charts. In this\nstudy, we show that modularizing chart generation and diversifying visual\ndetails improves chart understanding capabilities. In particular, we design a\nfive-step data synthesis pipeline, where we separate data and function creation\nfor single plot generation, condition the generation of later subplots on\nearlier ones for multi-subplot figures, visually diversify the generated\nfigures, filter out low quality data, and finally generate the question-answer\n(QA) pairs with GPT-4o. This approach allows us to streamline the generation of\nfine-tuning datasets and introduce the effective chart dataset (ECD), which\ncontains 10k+ chart images and 300k+ QA pairs, covering 25 topics and featuring\n250+ chart type combinations with high visual complexity.

The algorithms investigated include the classical linear\ntransformation, i.e., principal component analysis (PCA), state-of-the-art deep\nlearning method, i.e., convolutional autoencoder (CAE), and a residual network\npre-trained with large image datasets (PT). The experiment results indicated\nthat the latent space learned by CAE consistently showed higher threat scores\nfor all classification tasks. The classifications with PCA yielded high hit\nrates but also high false-alarm rates. In addition, the PT performed\nexceptionally well at recognizing tropical cyclones but was inferior in other\ntasks. Further experiments suggested that representations learned from\nhigher-resolution datasets are superior in all classification tasks for\ndeep-learning algorithms, i.e., CAE and PT. We also found that smaller latent\nspace sizes had minor impact on the classification task's hit rate.

Timely intervention in\nAD relies heavily on early and precise diagnosis, which remains challenging due\nto the complex and subtle structural changes in the brain. Most existing deep\nlearning methods focus only on a single plane of structural magnetic resonance\nimaging (sMRI) and struggle to accurately capture the complex and nonlinear\nrelationships among pathological regions of the brain, thus limiting their\nability to precisely identify atrophic features. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose an innovative framework, MPF-KANSC, which integrates multi-plane\nfusion (MPF) for combining features from the coronal, sagittal, and axial\nplanes, and a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-guided spatial-channel attention\nmechanism (KANSC) to more effectively learn and represent sMRI atrophy\nfeatures.

The KANSC attention mechanism further leverages a more flexible\nand accurate nonlinear function approximation technique, facilitating precise\nidentification and localization of disease-related abnormalities.

This paper investigates a critical question for compute-optimal\ndiffusion model deployment: Under a post-training setting without fine-tuning,\nis it more effective to reduce the number of denoising steps or to use a\ncheaper per-step inference? Intuitively, reducing the number of denoising steps\nincreases the variability of the distributions across steps, making the model\nmore sensitive to compression. In contrast, keeping more denoising steps makes\nthe differences smaller, preserving redundancy, and making post-training\ncompression more feasible. To systematically examine this, we propose PostDiff,\na training-free framework for accelerating pre-trained diffusion models by\nreducing redundancy at both the input level and module level in a post-training\nmanner. At the input level, we propose a mixed-resolution denoising scheme\nbased on the insight that reducing generation resolution in early denoising\nsteps can enhance low-frequency components and improve final generation\nfidelity. At the module level, we employ a hybrid module caching strategy to\nreuse computations across denoising steps.

However,\ngeospatial objects often exhibit subtle texture differences and similar spatial\nstructures, which can easily lead to semantic ambiguity and misclassification.\nMoreover, challenges such as irregular object shapes, blurred boundaries, and\noverlapping spatial distributions of semantic objects contribute to complex and\ndiverse edge morphologies, further complicating accurate segmentation. To\ntackle these issues, we propose a texture-aware and edge-guided Transformer\n(TEFormer) that integrates texture awareness and edge-guidance mechanisms for\nsemantic segmentation of URSIs. In the encoder, a texture-aware module (TaM) is\ndesigned to capture fine-grained texture differences between visually similar\ncategories to enhance semantic discrimination.

Under the\nWeakly-Supervised VAD (WSVAD) paradigm, only video-level labels are provided\nduring training, while predictions are made at the frame level. Although\nstate-of-the-art models perform well on simple anomalies (e.g., explosions),\nthey struggle with complex real-world events (e.g., shoplifting). This\ndifficulty stems from two key issues: (1) the inability of current models to\naddress the diversity of anomaly types, as they process all categories with a\nshared model, overlooking category-specific features; and (2) the weak\nsupervision signal, which lacks precise temporal information, limiting the\nability to capture nuanced anomalous patterns blended with normal events.

These experts are guided by a\ntemporal Gaussian splatting loss, enabling the model to leverage temporal\nconsistency and enhance weak supervision. The Gaussian splatting approach\nencourages a more precise and comprehensive representation of anomalies by\nfocusing on temporal segments most likely to contain abnormal events.

This\nmakes FL a suitable learning paradigm for remote sensing (RS) image\nclassification tasks, where data centralization may be restricted due to legal\nand privacy constraints. However, a key challenge in applying FL to RS tasks is\nthe communication overhead caused by the frequent exchange of large model\nupdates between clients and the central server. To address this issue, in this\npaper we propose a novel strategy (denoted as FedX) that uses\nexplanation-guided pruning to reduce communication overhead by minimizing the\nsize of the transmitted models without compromising performance.

Accordingly, the model is defined as an energy in which the variable is\na region membership function to assign pixels to either region, originally\nproposed by Chan and Vese in \\cite{chan:vese}. This energy is the sum of image\ndata terms in the regions and a length penalty for region boundaries.\nGoldstein, Bresson, Osher modify the energy of Chan-Vese in \\cite{gold:bre} so\nthat their new energy can be minimized efficiently using the split Bregman\nmethod to produce an equivalent two-phase segmentation.

The\nenhanced model achieves better identity similarity, lower FID scores, and\nvisibly superior qualitative results compared to the baseline.

Nevertheless,\ngenerative priors used for 2D relighting that directly relight from an input\nimage do not take advantage of intrinsic properties of the subject that can be\ninferred or cannot consider multi-view data at scale, leading to subpar\nrelighting. In this paper, we propose Lightswitch, a novel finetuned\nmaterial-relighting diffusion framework that efficiently relights an arbitrary\nnumber of input images to a target lighting condition while incorporating cues\nfrom inferred intrinsic properties. By using multi-view and material\ninformation cues together with a scalable denoising scheme, our method\nconsistently and efficiently relights dense multi-view data of objects with\ndiverse material compositions. We show that our 2D relighting prediction\nquality exceeds previous state-of-the-art relighting priors that directly\nrelight from images.
